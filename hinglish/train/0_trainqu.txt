 team ke liye warner kaa chalanaa behad jaruri ho gaya he

 aag kii vajah se 75 se 80 fisadi jal chuki mahila ne jo kaha he use sunakar rongte khadey ho jaaenge
 The victim said, 'I wished i would die
 koi bhi is dard se nahin guzarana chahega
 But thankfully now people will not rape me because i am completely burnt
 'babugarh thane main darj kii gai exiaar ke mutabik mahila kii 10 saal pehle hapur main shaadi karai gai
 The woman was 14 at the time
 shaadi ke salbhar baad yah rishta tut gaya jiske baad mahila apane pehle pati se hue bachche ke saath apane pita ke ghar rahane aa gai
 a few months later, the woman's father and aunt sold her to a man for 10,000 rupees
 jis vyakti ne mahila ko kharida tha uske saath saal 2011 main uski shaadi ho gai
 The woman also had a child with her second husband
 exiaar report ke mutabik 2014 main mahila ke saath jyaadati honi shuru hui
 The woman's current husband took a loan from a man at 10% interest, which he could not repay
 garibi kaa laabh uthaate hue karj dene vaale vyakti ne mahila ke saath kai baar rape kiya
 He also threatened that he would bring the village into disrepute
 us vyakti ke saath mahila ko teesraa baccha hua
 The woman said in the complaint that she told her husband several times about the matter
 pati ne use chup rahane ko kaha or duusare gharon main majdoor ke taur par kaam karte rahane ko kaha
 In 2016 too, a man named Shamu raped the woman after being found alone in the firm
 2017 main mahila ne exiaar main kaha he ki uske saath 14 alag-alag logon ne rape kiya
 These 14 people include Guddu, Madhu, Vipin, Garumit, Rammu, Anuj, Gopal, Doctor Subhash, Naginu, Kedar and a few others
 mahila ne apane saath hue rape ke bare main esechao se shikaayat kii to koi karrwai nahin kii gai

 He agreed to help the woman
 mahila or uske dost ko aropiyon ne jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di

 The villagers say on these allegations that all these allegations are false and fabricated
 mahila ke duusare pati kaa kahana he ki yah sabhi aarope galat hai
 It has been the habit of the woman since marriage, to call the police on small matters
 mahila ne aise aarope isliye lagaae hai kyonki uske paas kahin or jane kaa chaara nahin he
 The FIR has been mentioned in a report in the Times of India

 suryagrahan ek rochak khagoleey ghatana he
 August 21 is the second solar eclipse of the year
 aaie jaanate hai, suryagrahan ke bare main hindu mythology kya kahati he? According to mythological beliefs, after the solar eclipse, worship the deity by bathing in the holy rivers and ponds
 - snaan ke baad garibon or brahmanon ko daan dene kii parampara he
 It is believed that this reduces the effect of eclipse
 yahi kaaran he ki suryagrahan ke baad log ganga, yamuna, godavari aadi nadiyon main snaan ke liye jate hai or daan dete hai
 According to Hindu belief, food should not be eaten four hours before the eclipse starts in solar eclipse
 buudhe, balak or rogi ek prahar purv tak kha sakate hai
 It is also believed that leaves, straw, wood, flowers etc
 should not be broken on the day of eclipse
 - myth he ki garbhvatee stri ko suryagrahan yaa chandragrahan nahin dekhnaa chahie
 Because its side effects are believed to affect the baby
 tippaniyan - It is also popular belief that during the solar eclipse, hair and clothes should not be squeezed and teeth should not be cleaned
 grahan ke samay taala kholana, sona, mel-mutr kaa tyaag karnaa or bhojan karnaa - ye sab kaary varjit hai
 - The beginning of any auspicious work during solar eclipse or lunar eclipse is absolutely forbidden
 manyata he ki is dauraan shuru kiya gaya kaam acha parinaam nahin detaa he

 manyata he ki is dauraan shuru kiya gaya kaam acha parinaam nahin detaa he
 There is a tradition of giving donations to the poor and Brahmins after bathing
 manyata he ki isse grahan ke prabhaav main kami aati he
 This is the reason that after the solar eclipse, people go to the Ganges, Yamuna, Godavari, etc
 to bathe in rivers and give donations
 - hindu manyata ke anusaar, suryagrahan main grahan shuru hone se chaar prahar purv bhojan nahin karnaa chaiye
 The old, children and patients can eat till one hour before
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki grahan ke din pattey, tinke, lakdi, phool aadi nahin todna chahie
 The myth is that a pregnant woman should not see a solar eclipse or lunar eclipse
 kyonki mana jaataa he ki uske dushprabhav se shishu ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 The comments - yah manyata bhi prachlit he ki suryagrahan ke samay bal or vastra nahin nichodne chahie or daant bhi nahin saaf karne chahie
 At the time of eclipse, locking, sleeping, excreting of feces and urine and eating - all these functions are forbidden
 - suryagrahan yaa chandragrahan ke dauraan kisi bhi shubh kaary kii shuruyaat ko bilkul manaa kiya jaataa he
 It is believed that the work started during this time does not give good results

 ab janata inke vikaas ke naam par bharosa karegi nahin, isliye ram mandir kaa mudda saamne aa rahaa he

 isse pehle unhone 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se lekar mahagathbandhan or modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par apane vichaar rakhe
 During this time when he was asked about the success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure, he said that he only talks about the mind and this is his success
 vahiin, modi sarkaar kii kamajori par jab sharad pavaar se sawaal kiya gaya to unhone unke mantrimandal par hi sawaal khadey kar die
 Pawar said, 'modi has a team, but he does not have the capacity
 ye team thik tarah se sarkaar nahin chalaa paa rahi he

 anupam kai baar kapil se poochhate hai ki khabar kya he? anupam ke is sawaal kaa kapil jawaab dete hue kehete hai ki bas aap sabaki blessings chahie
 Hearing this, Anupam says that Blessing is needed for you
 anupam kii hajir javaabi sunakar audiyans to khushi se jhum uthati he lekin kapil sharma sharamaate najar aa rahe hai
 Singer Usha Uthap had also attended the Kapil Sharma Show before this
 us vakt bhi ek chota baccha sho main aayaa tha

 kapil bachche ko god main uthaakar uske saath khilne lagate hai
 Seeing this, Usha utters Teeth Kapil and says that this is your child
 ushaa utaap ke sawaal par kapil kehete hai nahin, aisa hone main bhi 9 maheene lagate hai
 The spot response of the Kapil is seen in every episode
 lekin pehali baar anupam kher ke sawaalon par kapil sharma kii bolti band hui he
 By the way, the news had come in the past that Kapil Sharma's house is going to be happy soon, his wife Ginni Chatrath is pregnant in these days
 bhartiya team vishwa cap main ab do maichon ke baad 1 jeet or 1 haar ke saath semifinal kii daud main barkaraar he lekin ek chintaa jo team india or uske fans ko sata rahi he wo he team india ke majboot ballebaazi line-ap kaa lagaataar fel hona
 Whenever a difficult pitch came, the batsmen of Team India raised their hands and this is not the first time
 ye lagaataar hota ja rahaa he
 In the Asia Cup, in front of a good bowling attack against Pakistan, Team India only had to chase 84 runs, then the team lost their first 3 wickets for just 8 runs
 sankatmochak sabit hue viraat kohli jinaki 51 gendon par kheli gai 49 ranon kii pari kii badaulat team india ne 5 wicket se maach jeeta phir baari ai world tii-20 main pakistan ke khilaaf match kii to 119 ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue bharat ne ek baar phir 23 ranon par apane 3 ballebaaz kho die
 Once again, Virat's 37-ball unbeaten 55-run innings crossed Team India and in a match which was not good for Virat against the Kiwi team, Team India lost a big margin and could not even chase 127 runs
 
 viraat par ye zarurat se zyada nirbharta team india ke liye khatre kii ghanti he or enditivi se exclusive baatcheet main purv test cricketer mohammad kaiff ne bataaya kii team ko isse jaldi hi nipatane kii jarurat he
 It is a matter of concern because too much weight falls on Virat Kohli
 agar unki pichhali do pariyon kii hi baat kar len jo unhone pakistan ke khilaaf kheli, asia cap or world tii-20 main jahaan unhone 49 or 55 naabad ranon kii pari kheli
 It looks as if India cannot win without Virat Kohli in these matches or even in low scoring matches on the pitches where India is playing
 tippaniyan No other batsman has shown such technique, whether it is Rohit or Shikhar or Raina
 yahaan tak kii yuvaraj bhi, haa unhone pichhlaa match acha khelaa acchhee saajhedaari kii, lekin jitna ham apni majboot ballebaazi kii baat karen jaise hi siming conditions yaa spinning trek miltaa he to hamaari ballebaazi kii expos ho jaati he
 Otherwise, our batting looks strong on Pata pitches but only Virat Kohli can be seen in difficult conditions
 bangladesh ke khilaaf team par thodaa kam dabaav hoga
 In such a situation, even if the pitch is difficult, the top order here will have to show why they are included in the world's strongest batting line-up
 asia cap main jab pakistan ke khilaaf ek achche gendbaazi akraman ke saamne team india ko mahaz 84 ranon kaa peechha karnaa tha tab team ne apane pehle 3 wicket mahaz 8 ranon par ganvaa die
 Virat Kohli proved to be a troubleshooter, thanks to his innings of 49 runs from 51 balls, India won the match by 5 wickets, then came the turn against Pakistan in the World T20, while chasing the target of 119, India once Then lost 3 of his batsmen for 23 runs
 ek baar phir viraat kii 37 gend par naabad 55 ranon kii pari ne team india kii naiya paar lagaai or jo ek match kiwi team ke khilaaf viraat ke liye acha nahin rahaa vahaan team india bade antar ne haari or 127 ranon kaa bhi peechha nahin kar saki
 This excessive dependence on Virat is a danger bell for Team India and in an exclusive conversation with NDTV, former Test cricketer Mohammad Kaif told that the team needs to deal with it soon
 chintaa kii baat isliye he kyonki bahut zyada bhaar viraat kohli ke upar aa jaataa he
 If we talk about his last two innings which he played against Pakistan, in Asia Cup and World T20 where he scored 49 and 55 not out
 aisa lag rahaa he ki agar wo in maichon main yaa phir aisi pichon par jahaan bharat khel rahaa he vahaan lo scoring maichon main bhi bharat viraat kohli ke bagaiyr jeet nahin saktaa
 The comments kisi or ballebaaz ne aisi takanic dikhaai nahin he, chaahe wo rohit ho yaa shikhar yaa phir raina kii bhi baat karen
 Even Yuvraj, yes, he played well in the last match, but a good partnership, but as much as we talk about our strong batting, our batting exposes as soon as the seaming conditions or spinning track is found
 varanaa pata pichon par hi hamaari ballebaazi majboot dikhti he lekin mushkil halaat main sirf viraat kohli hi nazar aate hai
 There will be little pressure on the team against Bangladesh
 aise main pich agar mushkil bhi hui to yahaan par top order ko dikhaanaa hoga ki aakhir kyon unhen vishwa ke sabase majboot ballebaazi line-ap main shumaar kiya jaataa he

 varanaa pata pichon par hi hamaari ballebaazi majboot dikhti he lekin mushkil halaat main sirf viraat kohli hi nazar aate hai
 There will be little pressure on the team against Bangladesh
 aise main pich agar mushkil bhi hui to yahaan par top order ko dikhaanaa hoga ki aakhir kyon unhen vishwa ke sabase majboot ballebaazi line-ap main shumaar kiya jaataa he
 It is a matter of concern because too much weight falls on Virat Kohli
 agar unki pichhali do pariyon kii hi baat kar len jo unhone pakistan ke khilaaf kheli, asia cap or world tii-20 main jahaan unhone 49 or 55 naabad ranon kii pari kheli
 It looks as if India cannot win without Virat Kohli in these matches or even in low scoring matches on the pitches where India is playing
 tippaniyan No other batsman has shown such technique, whether it is Rohit or Shikhar or Raina
 yahaan tak kii yuvaraj bhi, haa unhone pichhlaa match acha khelaa acchhee saajhedaari kii, lekin jitna ham apni majboot ballebaazi kii baat karen jaise hi siming conditions yaa spinning trek miltaa he to hamaari ballebaazi kii expos ho jaati he
 Otherwise, our batting looks strong on Pata pitches but only Virat Kohli can be seen in difficult conditions
 bangladesh ke khilaaf team par thodaa kam dabaav hoga
 In such a situation, even if the pitch is difficult, the top order here will have to show why they are included in the world's strongest batting line-up
 kisi or ballebaaz ne aisi takanic dikhaai nahin he, chaahe wo rohit ho yaa shikhar yaa phir raina kii bhi baat karen

 It is now being said that all the demands have been accepted, but the big question is whether the CBI investigation is the biggest diagnosis of the widespread scam
 
 
 ? kya isaki koi rajnatik jimmedaari nahin thi
 Is this not a mockery of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promises, in which there were vows not to be lenient against corruption
 lekin jab sushamaa swaraj ko nahin hataaya gaya, vasundhara raaje ko nahin hataaya gaya to phir shivaraj singh chouhan ko kyon hataaya jaae! It would have been unfair to Shivraj that in three similar cases, two people got compensation, but power would be taken away from Chauhan's hand
 pradhanmantri ko janata se kiye vaadon se zyada yah baat khalati thi ki shivaraj-vasundhara or sushamaa swaraj teenon ne kabhi puure man se modi ji ko netaa nahin mana

 vasundhara ko piem ne ek kadaa sandesh us samay diya, jab unke behad yogya or rajasi andaaj vaale bete ko lakh manuhaar ke baad bhi apane mantrimandal main jagah nahin di

 ek saath shivaraj, sushamaa or vasundhara or kuch had tak raman singh bhi modi ji ke radar par hai
 So why not remove them! Why the contribution was given even after all the criticism! So that the house, that is, peace in the Union remains

 bathroom se aane vaali durgandh kisi kaa bhi mood kharaab kar sakati he
 Many times the situation gets so bad that guests are coming at home and have to be embarrassed in front of them
 haalanki bazaar main kai aise utpaada maujuud hai jo ye daawa karte hai ki unke istemaal se durgandh dur ho jaaegi lekin ek ore jahaan inamen se kuch utpaada bahut mahange hote hai vahiin kai log aise bhi hote hai jinhen inaki gandh se allergy ho jaati he

 However, there is one thing that these things take some time to show effect so you have to be a little restrained
 1
 Lemon juice is one such thing in the kitchen which has hundreds of uses

 On the one hand, where the floor of the bathroom will shine, on the one hand a fragrant aroma will also start coming
 4
 If soapy water smells from your bathroom, you can use some fragrant detergent powder
 disergent powder ko pani main milakar farsh kii safai karne se ek ore jahaan farsh chamak uthta he vahiin badboo bhi kam ho jaati he
 Doing this two to three times a week removes foul smell forever

 isse purv is saal janvari main isi cese main maamle main chaar doshiyon rajkumaar, harshad, umesh bhai bharwar or prakashabhai rathod ko supreme court ne jamaanat di thi
 Babu Bajrangi had cited the loss of eyesight for bail
 babu bajrangi ko nichali adaalat ne umrakaid kii sajaa sunai thi, magar baad main gujarat hai court ne sajaa ghataakar 21 saal kar di thi
 However, an appeal of Bajrangi in this case is still pending in the Supreme Court
 philhal babu bajrangi ab tak paanch saal jail main guzaar chukaa he
 Babu Bajrangi was accused of killing 97 people during the 2002 rioting in Naroda Patia area of ahmedabad
 jiske chalate use trial court ne umrakaid kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 The Naroda Patiya massacre occurred in 2002 during the Godhra riots
 2007 main ek sting ke dauraan babu bajrangi ne yah sweekaar kiya tha ki usne logon kii hatyaein kii
 There was an uproar after Sting's video surfaced
 jiske baad se babu bajrangi par kanoonee shikanja badhata gaya

 The Ministry of Petroleum has prepared the issues to be placed before the new government
 mantralay kaa maananaa he ki saarvajanik kshetra kii tel companiyon ke apane mukhya kaamkaaj par dhyaan nahin de paane kii vajah se tel evam gas kaa utpaadan teji se nahin bad paa rahaa he
 The ministry has also said that increasing the number of cheap gas cylinders was not the right step
 narendra modi sarkaar ke liye taiyaar apni prastuti main mantralay ne kaha he ki rashtriya tel companiyaan gharelu utkhanan kii taraf puraa dhyaan nahin de paa rahi hai
 Five issues, including the legal dispute surrounding the signed contract with private sector oil exploration companies, have been cited as a problem during the tenure of the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government
 is puure maamle se jude sutron ne bataaya ki gharelu rasoi gas silendar kii seemaa chah se badhaakar 9 or phir ise 9 se badhaakar 12 kiya gaya
 It should not have been done
 mantralay kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki alpiji par pratyaksh laabh antaran yojana (debiti) sahi nahin thi
 Under this, the customer has to buy LPG cylinders at the market rate and the subsidy was sent directly to his bank account
 mantralay kii prastuti main jin anya kamiyon ko ginaya gaya he, usamen utpaadan saajhedaari anubandh (piessi) ko lekar kanoonee vivaad he tathaa america pratibandh ke kaaran iran ke saath judane ko lekar koi spashtataa nahin hona bhi shaamil he
 This led to a delay in participation in the large gas sector
 saath hi iran-pakistan-bharat gas pipeline par bhi asar padaa
 Private sector company Reliance Industries is in a dispute with the Petroleum Ministry over various issues
 keji basin main lakshya se kam utpaadan rahanaa, tel evam gas kii koi khoj vanijyik rup se vyavhaarik he athwa nahin yah kaise pataa chale
 The time which should have been spent in promoting incentives for increasing the production of oil and gas in the country, is the time being spent in the battle of legal disputes in the court
 sutron ke anusaar mantrimandal sachiv ajit seth ke kehane par mantralay ne yah prastutikaran taiyaar kiya he
 It also stresses that the Production Partnership Agreement (PSC) should be changed based on the experience so far and it should be re-designed
 sutron ke anusaar mantralay kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki tel evam prakritik gas nigam (oengisi) petrorsayan or tel rifining tathaa alenji terminal jaise kshetron main vistaar kar rahi he jisaki vajah se tel evam prakritik gas kii khoj evam utpaadan se uskaa dhyaan bant rahaa he
 The Ministry has also given the example of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation in the same context that it is setting up a sugar mill out of its main refining activity
 mantralay ne kuch uplabdhiyon bhi ginai hai
 40 million tonnes of refinery capacity was raised in the last five years and this 17
 5 karod se badhkar 21
 50 million tons
 june 2010 se petrol ke daam ko niyantranmukt karne or janvari 2013 se dijal ke daam main har maheene halki vruddhi ke faisle ko bhi isamen bataaya gaya he
 Ministry 53
 30 lakh ton kachche tel ke bhandaaran kii vyavastha ke bare main bhi bataaya he
 The ministry has set a target of at least 25 per cent production of crude oil and natural gas and an increase of 250 million tonnes in refining capacity for the next five years
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or endie ko mili baari bharkam jeet ne vipakshi partiyon ke netaaon kaa dil zaahir taur par baari kar diya he
 With this, BJP has won a tremendous victory in 28 out of 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh
 is jeet ke baad rajgad main ek anokhi shart bhi charchaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 In fact, before the results, there was a unique condition between Congress leader Bapulal Sen and BJP leader Rambabu Mandloi in Rajgarh
 shart ye thi ki agar congress jiti to bijepi netaa rambabu apana sir mundavaayenge or agar bijepi jiti to congress netaa bapulal sen apana sir mundavaayenge
 Congress leader Bapulal Sen went to this condition, when the BJP has got a tremendous majority due to the Modi wave across the country, then according to this condition, Congress leader Bapulal Sen has shaved his head in front of BJP workers in the village of Saram Harana on Friday
 
 bapulal sen ne madhyapradesh main congress kii haar ke peeche rahul gandhi ke 10 din main karj maafee vaale bayaan ko doshi mana or kaha ki rahul gandhi ko 10 din kii bajaay kisaanon ko teen maheene kaa samay dena chahie tha kyonki sahi samay par kisaanon kaa karj maaf nahin hone se kisaanon main gussa tha or iskaa khamiyaja party ko bhugatna padaa
 In Ujjain, the city general minister shaved his head
 In Ujjain, the impact of the Congress's defeat was seen when the city general minister shaved his head after the defeat of the Congress
 darasal, congress ke shahar mahaamantri dharmendra bhatnagar ne teen din pehle ati utsaah main aakar centre main congress kii sarkaar nahin banane par karyaalay ke neeche sir mundwane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 bjp's big win in Madhya Pradesh, tell us that BJP won a big victory in Madhya Pradesh and the Congress has failed badly
 madhya pradesh main bijepi ko 28 siten mili hai or congress keval ek hi seat jeet pai
 In this victory of BJP, many veteran Congress leaders lagged behind
 vahiin, sihor main nattejey dekhakar sihor jila congress adhyaksh ratan singh thakur kii harntac se maut ho gai
 Former media veteran Peter Mukherjee was questioned by the CBI for six hours on Friday
 jaanch agency yah pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he ki peter or indrani mukherjee dwaara sthapit media house se paise nikaalkar shina bora ke videshi khate main jamaa karne ke baad hi kya unke bich vivaad paidaa hua, jo antat: shina kii maut kii vajah bana
 CBI sources said that the investigating agency showed Peter the income tax returns filed by him and Indrani to ascertain his investments in India and abroad
 haalanki yah bhi spasht kiya ki is samay shina kii hatya ke peeche kisi bhi sateek sambhavit manshaa ke bare main kuch kah paanaa sambhav nahin he
 Work is being done on different angles
 bataate chalem ki april, 2012 menindrani mukherjee, uske purv pati sanjeev khanna or purv driver shyamvar raay ne shina bora kii hatya karke uske shav ko jangal main dafna diya tha
 Sheena was the child born to Indrani's first marriage

 The amount of time that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spent after assuming power, almost the same time is left in the assembly elections in Bihar
 vakt ke is antaraal menek-do maheenon kaa fark bhi ho saktaa he
 bjp's debacle in the Delhi elections continues
 apane apane tareeke se isaki charchaa ho rahi he
 At the center of all this is Kiran Bedi, the bjp's CM candidate
 khud kiran bedi ne bhi isaki apane tareeke se vivechna kii he
 Forget Delhi, think of Bihar, in her latest blog Kiran Bedi writes, "I failed the exam and i take full responsibility for my decision
 lekin meri antaratma fail nahin hui he
 "kiran Bedi has been under the test of the bjp's parent organization RSS since its inception
 aresas ke mukhpatr panchajway main ek lekh main pehle bhi kiran bedi ko lekar sawaal uthaae ja chuke hai
 Now the Sangh has accepted that making Kiran Bedi the chief ministerial candidate was a big mistake
 saath hi, sangh kii najar main party kaaryakartaaon kii andekhi bhi bijepi kii haar kii badi vajah rahi
 Still, the questions start to revolve around Modi walking around
 lok sabha ke baad hue vidhansabha chunaavon main jitati ai bijepi ko itnaa jor kaa jhatka kyon laga? aakhir modi ne dilli chunaavon main prachaar main koi kasar baaki to rakhi nahin thi
 Immediately after the Delhi results, BJP high command Amit Shah had even advised the workers to forget about the past and take further care
 charchaa to ye bhi he ki aresas ne bihar chunaav main prachaar ke liye morcha bhi sambhaal liya he
 In this regard, important meetings have been held with the union officials and BJP leaders
 sangh kii final reportdilli main haar ko lekar mukhpatr ke jariye sangh ne poocha he, 'bijepi kyon haari? kya bedi ko siem candidet bananaa sahi tha? agar harshavardhan yaa dilli bijepi ke duusare netaaon ke netritv main chunaav ladaa gaya hota to parinaam duusare hote?'sawaal or bhi hai
 For example, has the BJP failed to convey the achievements of the Narendra Modi government to the public? Was the party completely dependent on the Modi wave? Did the party lose due to unity in the organization, planning and lack of respect for the sentiments of the workers? There is also an advisory question, 'BJP leaders have to find the answer that they have the ideology of the Sangh and the commitment of the party workers What else is capital? ' There is a discussion that Delhi repeated in Bihar, so the Sangh is also thinking of taking command of the campaign
 dilli kii shikast par focus kiran bedi kaa blog unki tamaam uplabdhiyon se bharaa to he hi ant behad imotional he
 Kiran writes, 'finally, i would like to thank all those who expressed confidence in me
 or saath hi unako bhi jinhone mujhe harsambhav apshabd se sambodhit kiya
 i feel relieved that my parents are not alive to see all this
 ' kiran bedi ke nishane par koun koun he? isamen yahi baat samajhane vaali he
 Modi wave, for how long? Will Modi wave remain as effective till Bihar elections? The Vishwa Hindu Parishad may have understood this better
 tabhi to 'lav jihad' or 'ghar vaapasi' jaise vivaadit muddon par jahrile bayanon ke liye mashhoor viechpi ne is maamle main alag stand liya he
 VHP leader Surendra Jain advises that Hindu organizations should desist from harassing Prime Minister Narendra Modi by making controversial statements
 jain kii raay main modi ji desh kii sarkaar chalaa rahe hai or aise main unhen disturb karnaa thik nahin hoga
 Jain asks what kind of action has Modi taken which goes against the country or Hindutva
 yani modi ji ko kaam karne kaa mauka diya janaa chahie
 If Modi government does not work, what will be left to tell people? And when the government will not be able to do any work, what is the wave? Prime Minister Narendra Modi's position in the World Cup season has also become like the captain of the cricket team
 jite to vaah vaah, haare to hai hai
 Modi gave the BJP an unthinkable majority in the Lok Sabha
 maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand main bhi sarkaar banavaa di
 In Jammu and Kashmir, there is an attempt to set the power equation
 vaise bhi pichley 12 saal main modi ek hi chunaav to haare hai
 And even in the local body elections of Assam, the BJP has won - then how can anyone ask that the Modi wave has stopped
 kamyaabi or naakaami amuman desh, kaal or paristhiti par nirbhar karti he
 From where does Modi ji bring anti-incumbency factor in Delhi? dephender harmanpreet singh ke penlti corner par kiye gaye do gol kii badaulat bharat ne 26wein ajalan shah cap hockey toornament main ravivaar ko newjiland ke khilaaf 3-0 se damdaar jeet darj kii

 Jolie stressed the responsibility of the Security Council in the discussion on peace and security and women, saying that the Council should come forward and provide leadership and assistance to those nations which are not able to take appropriate steps on this issue

 He said, the use of sexual violence as a weapon is an attack on the security system
 jin rashtron main yah aparaadh saamaanya hai, vahaan kabhi shanti sthapit nahin kii ja sakati

 But accountability is that of any one

 We have seen many officers that they work with their responsability
 par kuch aise he jo risponsibility se kaam nahin karte hai
 The present central government committed to jaggery governance, this government is known for the degree of commitment during the two-and-a-half-year tenure of the government and all these officials should know
 samaaj ke antim seedhi tak jo baitha he us tak sab yojana pahunche ye hamarapradhanmantri kaa kamitmentai
 The Home Minister said that we have seen officers from a very young age

 Officers should have the ability to listen
 nae adhikari khaas taur par ye samajhe ki lekin jab koi political agxcutive kuch kahata he kuch galat to usase daro nahin
 Instead, tell them the law
 agar netaa order detaa he to usko order dene dijiye mike par or aap kanoon ke mutabik kaam kariye
 No need to be afraid
 kabhi-kabhi kuch adhikari nirnay lene se bachate hai
 This halts progress and process
 isse nuksaan hota he
 You act as a deciding role
 kisi se daant or jhadap nahin kerani chahie
 On the occasion, Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, Dr
 Jitendra Singh said that the work of 'minimum Government and Maximum Governance' could not be completed without good officers

 sahvaag ne dhoni ke us bayaan par sawaal uthaaya tha ki unke jaise senior fielding main dhime hai jabaki gambhir ne media se kaha tha ki bharat ko australia ke khilaaf match aakhri over se pehle hi jeet lenaa chaiye tha jisamen dhoni ne vijayi ran banaaye the
 Dhoni did not take the statements of Sehwag and Gambhir positive
 usne yah bhi sunishchit kiya ki kharaab pradarshan ke baavjood unke kareebi suresh raina or ravinder jadeja jaise khilaadi baahar naa hone paye
 Reportedly, Sehwag refused to address a joint press conference with Dhoni last week, though no one is willing to confirm it
 tippaniyan Sehwag was officially rested from the Asia Cup on fitness issues
 agar bhartiya team trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke best aaf thri finels ke liye kwalifai kar jaati he to vah austrailia ke khilaaf match khilne ke liye taiyaar hai
 But it will depend on whether the Australian team defeats Sri Lanka in the final league match tomorrow of the tri-series
 jinhen lagata he ki sahvaag kaa karier khatm ho gaya to unka ishaara is baat ko lekar bhi he ki agar vah feet nahin the to unhen ab tak swadesh aa janaa chahie tha
 If Sehwag had a poor form issue, then there was no need to include Sachin Tendulkar in the Asia Cup squad
 dhoni ko bisisiai ko puraa samarthan praapt he or yah is baat se bhi saaf ho jaataa he ki bhartiya team ke unki captaini main pichley saal june se lagaataar england or australia main mili aath shikast ke baavjood bhi unka dabadabaa badha hi he
 Sehwag was not selected in the squad for the Asia Cup while Virat Kohli was named vice-captain in place of Gambhir, who captained India in the 5‚Äì0 series win against New Zealand
 team ko yahaan media se dur rakhaa gaya he or team ne abhyaas tak nahin kiya
 The team management does not want to comment on the differences seen within the team
 team sutron ne bataaya ki yah spasht he ki dilli ke ladakon gambhir or sahvaag ko captain mahendra singh dhoni se saarvajanik taur par matbhed jataane kii sajaa bhugatni padi he
 Sehwag questioned Dhoni's statement that seniors like him are slow in fielding while Gambhir told the media that India should have won the match against Australia even before the last over in which Dhoni scored the winning runs
 dhoni ne sahvaag or gambhir ke bayaan ko sakaaratmak nahin liya
 He also ensured that players such as Suresh Raina and Ravinder Jadeja, who were close to him, were not let out despite poor performances
 report ke anusaar sahvaag ne pichley saptaah dhoni ke saath sanyukt press conference ko sambodhit karne se inkaar kar diya tha haalanki koi isaki pushti karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 The comments sahvaag ko fitness mudde par asia cap se adhikarik rup se aaraam diya gaya tha
 If the Indian team qualifies for the Best of Three Finals of the tri-series, then they are ready to play against Australia
 lekin yah is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki kal australian team trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke kal hone vaale antim lig match main srilanka ko haraa detii he yaa nahin
 Those who feel that Sehwag's career is over, then his hint is also that if he was not fit, he should have returned home by now
 agar sahvaag kii kharaab farm mudda tha to phir sachin tendulkar ko asia cap kii team main shaamil karne kii jarurat nahin thi
 Dhoni has full support from the BCCI and it is clear from this that despite his eight consecutive defeats in England and Australia since June last year under his captaincy of the Indian team, his dominance has increased

 aaj mummy ko de den chuttee:baahar jane se pehle aap hadabadi main puraa ghar failaa dete honge lekin waapas aate honge to har saamaan apni jagah hi miltaa hoga
 But do something different today
 aaj ke din to kam se kam apni maa ko kaam se chuttee de dijie

 desh kii sarkari airlines air india ke nijeekaran kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 Amid this preparation, Air India is preparing an important plan, according to which it will lay off a large number of its employees
 news agency roitre ke hawaale se ai khabar ke mutabik air india apane ek tihaai staff kii chatni karne kii yojana par kaam kar rahi he
 This will reduce the burden on the company by giving voluntary retirement to about 15,000 employees
 haalanki kendra sarkaar ne media report kaa khandan karte hue kaha he ki usne aisi koi yojana nahin banaai he
 According to the explanation of the Central Government, Air India and its units have just 20,000 employees in the country, while media reports have claimed that the company has 40,000 employees
 riter kaa daawa he ki air india yah kadam company ko 2018 main bechney se pehle uthaaegi jisase bechate samay company kii oparating cost ko kam dikhaaya ja sake
 This will be the largest draft of a voluntary retirement for any government company in the country
 gauratlab he ki maujuuda samay main air india ke lagbhag 40,000 karmchaaree hai
 Such a large number of employees is considered an important reason behind the sinking of AI

 In addition, the company also canceled plans to lease 8 Boeing 787s of larger size
 air india board ne haal hi main is prastaav ko manjuuri di thi lekin ab nijeekaran kii kendra sarkaar se manjuuri milane ke baad is disha main koi kaam nahin kiya gaya he
 Sources claim that the central government wants Air India to be brought into this position before being sold so that it can attract any private company
 modi cabinet ne abhi pichley maheene hi karj main dubi air india ke nijeekaran kii manjuuri di thi
 According to the central government plan, the process of privatization of the company will start in 2018 and be completed by the end of the year
 kendriya cabinet se nijeekaran kii manjuuri ke baad air india kii kharidne ke liye tata, indigo or spicejet ne dilchaspee jaahir kii he
 Experts claim that these Indian companies have decided to make a big bid to get Air India
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle air india ko bachaane kii kai baar kavayad kii gai lekin kendra sarkaar kii sabhi koshishen bekaar gai
 From 2007 to 2010, the erstwhile UPA government tried to improve the position of Air India and Indian Airlines, but even that company could not stand on its own
 vahiin 2012 main tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ne air india ko 30 hajaar karod kaa belout package lekin company kii financial sthiti main koi sudhaar dekhne ko nahin mila
 Currently, there is a debt of about 55 thousand crore rupees on government airlines

 Delhi survived, everyone must be saying the same
 yakeenan jis tarah se ek ke baad ek bukamp ke teen jatke dilli main lage, usase dilliwaale dehshat main hai
 Buildings began to tremble due to the earthquake on Tuesday, people came out of the houses, everything started moving
 dilli bhale hi iran ke bukamp se kanpi he, lekin ye dilli ke liye chetavanee he, kyonki agar iran ke 7
 Delhi may be shaken thrice by an earthquake of 8 magnitude, so what would happen if a large magnitude earthquake struck Delhi
 khatara bada he or dilli ko jaagnaa hoga
 Iran's earthquake shook half of the country in the tremor that struck Delhi
 kareeb-kareeb puraa uttar bharat bukamp se kaanp uthaa
 The earthquake of Iran became the epicenter of the earthquake and then from Iran to Pakistan and India, the earthquake shook it
 lekin iran main aae 7
 The 8-magnitude earthquake raised concerns for the country's capital
 iran ke bukamp ne dilli ko daraa diya, sahamaa diya, logon main bukamp kii dehshat si fail gai he
 The earthquake gave a shock of panic in Delhi that it could hardly get out of people's minds
 dilli or ensiaar main bukamp ke ek ke baad ek teen jatke mahasoos kiye gaye or jatke bhi halke phulke nahin balki itane zordaar ki daftaron main, gharon main rakhaa saamaan kaanpane laga, log maare khuf ke imaaraton se baahar nikal aae
 How Deadly Can Earthquake Be? Why and how deadly earthquake can be in Delhi, and what is the reason for it? After all, in which zone of Delhi earthquake? Why Iran earthquake is raising concerns about country's capital? Delhi is in the second most dangerous zone of earthquake
 koi bhi bada bukamp dilli main tabaahi kaa manzar dikhaa saktaa he
 These earthquake tremors are warning Delhi, maybe this is a big trailer of danger and after this trailer one needs to be careful
 badi tivrata ke bukamp se dilli ke darane kii kai vajah he
 One is in the Danger Zone of the earthquake of Delhi and multi-storied buildings, illegal construction from above, are giving danger in Delhi
 agar dilli main badi tivrata kaa bukamp aayaa, to tabaahi kaa kufnaak manzar dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 Earthquake falls in Zone 4: As soon as the clock struck 4: 14 minutes on Tuesday, the earth shook
 aisi hili ki jaise insaan kaanp uthaa, imaaraten kaanp uthi, ped hilne lage
 40 people died in the earthquake-centered Iran, but the panic struck Delhi
 bukamp ke khatre ke aadhaar par desh ko 5 zone main baanta gaya he, sabase khataranaak bukamp kii sambhaavna zone 5 main hoti he
 After that zone 4 can be prone to dangerous earthquakes
 dilli bukamp ke zone 4 main aati he
 Now the skyscrapers of Delhi and NCR, the buildings in the narrow streets of Delhi, the buildings along the banks of the Yamuna, the buildings in the illegal areas of Delhi are standing in fear
 dilli par khatra chautarafa he
 Earthquake experts believe that the nature of nature may fall on Delhi
 or agar aisa hua to dilli main tabaahi kaa alam kya hoga, iskaa andaaza koi nahin laga saktaa
 Can come to delhi-ncr7
 5 tivrata kaa bukampabukamp ke khatre se dilli endieme yani neshnal dizaster management association bhi aagaah kar chukaa he
 The danger is that high-rise buildings in Delhi should not become a problem
 kaha jaataa he ki dilli or ensiaar main 7
 Earthquakes of up to 5 magnitude may also occur
 - dilli main 91
 7% of the houses are made of solid brick
 - jabaki 3
 7% of the houses are made of raw bricks
 bukamp kaa jitna bada khatra rajdhani dilli par hai, utana hi khatra ensiaar yani noida, ghaziabad, faridabad, gudgaanv jaise shaharon ke liye bhi he
 There are many areas in Delhi where there is no place to set foot
 upar se makaan or imaaraton kii bhi koi guarantee nahin he, ki wo bukamparodhi hai bhi yaa nahin
 The danger may be right here
 in ilaakon main bukamp ke bare main bhi sochakar dar lagata he
 Everybody is frightened by Tuesday's earthquake in Delhi and NCR, obviously there will be a question in everyone's mind, can the earthquake not be stopped? kya he export kii raibukamp ke jatke duniya ko dahala chuke hai, bukamp se tabaahi kii tasviren duniya dekhati hui aa rahi he
 But the biggest question is can earthquakes be stopped? Can an earthquake be detected? These are all the questions that perhaps arise in the mind of a common man
 lekin vaigyanikon ke paas bhi bukamp ko rokane kaa koi upaay nahin he
 Nor can anyone foresee this natural disaster
 darasal bukamp ko roka to nahin ja saktaa he, lekin usase bachane kaa upaay nikaala ja saktaa he
 No one dies due to earthquake, damage is caused by the collapse of buildings, bridges breaking
 aise main agar imaaraton ko bukamparodhi banaaya jaae to bukamp se aane vaali tabaahi se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Punjab Revenue Minister Bikram Singh Majithia, who received summons from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), assured full cooperation with the agency investigating the money laundering complaints in the Rs 6000 crore drug racket case
 unhone ek bayaan main kaha, ‚Äò‚Äò
 
 
 When the summons arrived at my house, i was not at home and i contacted the concerned officer on phone to cooperate with the investigating agency and instructed my employee to receive the summons immediately
 ‚Äô‚Äô Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal came to her rescue saying that issuing summons to a person does not mean that he is a criminal

 As we all know that the film xxx, Return of Gender Cage is the third part of xxx from which Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone has debuted in Hollywood
 film main vin dijal kendriya bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 xxx, Vin Diesel in Return of Gender Cage makes a team to free the Pandora box from the people who snatch the box from the CIA and take it to the Philippines
 pendorra box ek aisa upkaran he jo duniya ke sabhi military satellite ko control karata he
 This device can be used for a terrorist event which can prove to be dangerous
 tippaniyan The DJ Caruso-directed xxx is also produced in Return of Gender Cage 3D and is enjoyed in 3D
 ection jabardast he
 There are heart-pounding actions on the trains and along the trains that make the story stand out
 ladaaku vimaan ke andar ladaai or vahaan se kudane ke drishy dekhne laayak hai
 Vin Diesel is tremendous in his action role
 bharat main deepika padukon ke naam par is film kaa prachaar ho rahaa he
 But let us say that the hero of this film is Vin Diesel
 bas deepika ke phens ke liye acchhee khabar yah he ki kai kirdaaron main ek ahm kirdaar serena unger bhi he jo film main ahm he or deepika is role main acchhee lagi hai
 But let me say one thing clearly that if you like this type of action movies or Hollywood style then only go to see this film because there is nothing special in the film
 balki main to ye kahuunga ki ection bhi jarurat se kuch jyaad hi he
 In many places, the action has become meaningless to me
 kai baar ham is tarah kii film bhi dekh chuke hai jisamen hero apni ek team banaakar kisi mishan par jaataa he or use jeet kar waapas aata he
 Just like in this film too
 sirf screenple badal gaya he
 So my rating for this film is 3 stars
 deje karuso nirdeshit xxx, ritern of gender kej 3 di main bhi banaai gai he or iskaa majaa aata he 3 di main dekhne main
 The action is tremendous
 gadiyon par or gadiyon ke saath dil dahala dene vaale ection hai jo rongte khadey kar dete hai
 The scenes of fighting and jumping from within the fighter plane are worth seeing
 vin dijal apane ection role main jabardast lage hai
 The film is being promoted in India under the name of Deepika Padukone
 magar ham bataa den ki is film ke hero vin dijal hi hai
 The good news for fans of Just Deepika is that Serena Unger is also an important character in many characters who is important in the film and Deepika is good in this role
 lekin ek baat saaf kah duun ki agar is tarah kii ection filmein yaa hollywood ke style ko aap pasand karte hai tabhi is film ko dekhne jaaen kyonki iske alaava or kuch khaas nahin he film main
 Rather i would say that action is also more than necessary
 kai jagah ke ection mujhe be matlab ke lage
 Many times we have also seen such a film in which the hero forms a team and goes on a mission and comes back after winning it
 bas is film main bhi vaisaa hi he
 Only the screenplay has changed
 isliye is film ke liye meri reating he 3 star
 But let me say one thing clearly that if you like this type of action movies or Hollywood style then only go to see this film because there is nothing special in the film
 balki main to ye kahuunga ki ection bhi jarurat se kuch jyaad hi he
 In many places, the action has become meaningless to me
 kai baar ham is tarah kii film bhi dekh chuke hai jisamen hero apni ek team banaakar kisi mishan par jaataa he or use jeet kar waapas aata he
 Just like in this film too
 sirf screenple badal gaya he
 So my rating for this film is 3 stars
