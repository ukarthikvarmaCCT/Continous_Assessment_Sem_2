 In Uttarakhand, the election of all the 11 rebels from Congress to BJP is considered to be the toughest and biggest at this time
 harish ravat se lekar pradesh kii janata yahi soch rahi he ki kya bijepi kaa bhala ye 11 vidhayak kar paaenge
 If any seat is most discussed among them, then it is the Kotdwar seat of Uttarakhand
 negi ne haraaya tha khanduri koyehi vah seat he jis par congress se baagi hue kaddavar netaa harak singh ravat camel ke nishaan par chunaav lard rahe hai to duusari ore pradesh ke swasthya mantri surendra singh negi congress kii ore se morcha jamaaye hue hai
 Let me remind you that these are the same Negi who created a new history in Uttarakhand by defeating BJP Chief Minister General Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri from Kotdwar seat in 2012 election
 negi ke kadam se aayaa tha raajnneetik bhuuchaalaye seat isliye kai myne main congress or bijepi ke liye khaas he kyonki is baar yahaan se baagiyon main sabase zyada charchit rahe harak singh ravat bijepi ke tikat se lard rahe hai
 The same Harak Singh Rawat, who played the biggest role in creating a stir in the politics of Uttarakhand in March 2016
 uttarakhand main paudi rudraprayag or lansdowne jaisi seat se jeet chuke harak ke liye is baar kotdwar seat puri tarah se nai he
 Negi has the sting of being hopeful from the public and somewhere along with Rawat, along with the current Health Minister Surendra Singh Negi in the Congress Government standing in front of him, has also put all his strength to fight Rawat
 janata bhi is baar is tension main hai ki ve kisko chune kyonki donon hi netaa unke apane se hai
 Surendra Singh Negi is taking his tenure in public
 unhen lagata he ki janata unhen is baar bhi jeet kii choukhat par le jaakar seva kaa mauka degi
 Apart from this, he is also making a place in the hearts of the public by sarcasm on the antidote
 duusari ore harak singh bhi palatwaar karne se peeche nahin hai
 Naagi is expected to be influenced by the BJP wave, and even though Harak has always been in the limelight, but this time another image of him is in front of the public
 sarkaar se alag hokar bijepi ke tikat se chunaav lard rahe harak din-raat yahaan prachaar main lage hue hai
 Harak has been campaigning in Kotdwar very closely for how to create a synergy between the hill and plane voters
 harak singh ravat maanate hai ki is baar kotdwar main hi nahin puure uttarakhand main bijepi kii lahar he or kotdwar se ve baari maton se jeet kar aa rahe hai
 Netkot, playing the emotional card, gave the health minister, but said that it is also being said that the minister could not cure the health of Kotdwar
 jeet kii khatir harak or negi, donon janata ke bich imotional card khilne se bhi gurej nahin kar rahe hai
 While Harak wants to draw tears towards the public by shedding tears on the day, Negi too is not behind him
 ve bhi ghar-ghar jaakar janata ko lubhaane kaa ek bhi mauka nahin chhod rahe hai
 But, if the public is to be believed, he is unhappy with everyone, where the Health Minister was not able to get him treated
 aazaadee ke baad se ab tak rahaa 'thakur' kaa kabjais seat par sabase khaas baat ye he ki aazaadee ke baad se ab tak is seat par agar koi jeeta he to thakur hi jeeta he
 Many people have tried their luck but the public has only made Thakur the MLA
 surendra singh negi se lekar shailendra ravat tak jo bhi vidhayak yahaan bana wo thakur hi bana
 This time both Thakurs are in the field and the public is awarded the crown, who will tell the upcoming date only on 11 March

 The Bharatiya Janata Party contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections under the leadership of the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi and won with a thumping majority
 narendra modi ne pradhanmantri pad kii jimmedaari sanbhali or bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh pad par jald hi unke gujarat ke sabase kareebi amit shah asin hue
 The caravan of bjp's victory in the name of Modi in the general elections has now reached Tripura in the northeast, passing through Maharashtra, Haryana, UP, Uttarakhand, Himachal and Goa
 jin rajyon main bijepi ko bahumat mila, vahiin to uski sarkaar bani hi, is dauraan kuch rajyon main bijepi ne sabase badi party na banane ke baavjood bhi sarkaar banaai
 If the regional parties were supported in a state, then with their support, the Congress proceeded to fulfill the call of free India
 ab is kadi main karnataka kii baari he
 Where voting is to be held for the upcoming assembly elections on May 12
 dakshin bharat main yah iklauta rajya he, jahaan bijepi majboot sthiti main rahi he
 Once such an opportunity also came here, when the Bharatiya Janata Party won the most seats, yet it could not succeed in forming the government
 2004 main bijepi ne jeetin sabase zyada seat2004 ke karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne pehali baar soobe main apni takat kaa ehsaas karaayaa
 BJP won 79 seats in the elections held in 224 assembly seats
 jabaki congress ko 65 or janata dal secular ko 58 siton par santosh karnaa padaa
 BJP could not form a government, BJP emerged as the largest party in this election but fell far short of the magic figure required to form a government
 jiskaa nateeja ye hua ki congress or janata dal secular ne gathbandhan kar sarkaar bana lee
 However, in the current politics, it is discussed that the BJP can form a government in the states where the Congress gets the most seats by the strategy of manipulation
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main goa main aisa hi dekhne ko mila
 Where Congress won the most seats, but formed the government with the support of regional parties and independents
 iske alaava nagaland main bijepi ne andipeepi ko samarthan dekar sabase zyada siten jeetne vaali enpief ko baahar kar diya
 Also read: When Kamal first bloomed in Karnataka, 3 cms had to change BJP in 5 years, now Amit Shah is claiming victory in Karnataka
 congress or janata dal secular bhi majbootee se chunaav lard rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is also feared that the election results may not go towards the hung assembly

 Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, who was in trouble, broke his silence on Tuesday and accused the judiciary and his opponents of speeding up the same cases which are against the government

 This is the first comment of Zardari, who suddenly went to Dubai on December 6 for treatment and created speculation about the future of the government

 haal ke dinon main koi nai cheez kya judi he aapaki jindagi main?paansingh (tomars) kii kamyaabi
 Not just because it is a good film but because it has many dimensions
 ek aadmi kaa us tarah kii 
 Live life and leave the story for us
 kisi divine (ruhani takat) kaa haath lag rahaa tha, jaise vah chaahati thi ki us kahani ko share kiya jaae, or kaise us samay kii kahani aaj railevent ho jaati he
 One more thing

 Something was demanded from me which I

 There was no effort
 
 
 yani jo rolls aap kar chuke hai?jaise life ov paai (nirdeshkah aing lee)
 It was very challenging
 kaam karne kaa meraa jo system he, usamen kahin bhi nahin aa rahi thi
 The director was demanding me, taking me to a foreign territory, i wanted some performance which was very new to me
 uske bare main jaananaa chahta hum ki finali kya (hua) hoga uskaa
 There was a big discussion on taking you in The Amazing Spiderman (director: Mark Webb) but was surprised to see your nominal role in the film

 What are those things that inspire you to work there? The kind of challenge that the films there give me, like the raga, as they speak to pierce, i do not get that chance anywhere else
 vahi meraa interest he
 For me, it is not a war of survival, (rather) a luxury
 vahaan se paisa mujhe yahaan kaa dasvaan hissaa bhi nahin miltaa hoga, kai filmon main
 i do not think the demand that Lee made from me, any other director in the world will demand that from me

 Then even if you do that kind of film, how much entertainment do you think you are getting? And would you like to keep doing this? You have been watching that game for so many years

 Every man has his own game

 sujatha singh ko videsh sachiv ke pad se hataa diya gaya or es jaishankar ko nayaa videsh sachiv banaaya gaya tha
 AP Venkateswaran was removed by Rajiv Gandhi in 1987, 28 years before Sujatha Singh
 sujatha singh kaa kaarykaal abhi 8 maheene baaki tha
 The Prime Minister's Office wanted to remove Sujatha Singh in December itself, but the matter was deferred on the intervention of the Foreign Minister
 pichley chah maheene main videsh mantralay ne jitne bhi rajdooton kii niyukti kii sifarish kii, pradhanmantri karyaalay ne use hari jhandi nahin di, matlab saaf he ki pradhanmantri videsh sachiv ko hataane kaa man bana chuke the
 Sujatha Singh was appointed during the Manmohan Singh government
 us vakt bhi manmohan singh jaishankar ko hi videsh sachiv bananaa chaahate the, magar sujatha singh ke pita pivi rajeshwar gandhi parivaar ke kaaphi kareebi rahe hai
 He was also the head of the Intelligence Bureau and was later appointed as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh by the UPA Government
 vahiin es jaishankar ke pita ke subrahmanyam tab ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke kaaphi kareebi the, raksha maamalon ke bade jaankaar bhi or newclear deal kii shuruyaat ke madhyasth bhi rahe
 The first question was asked by the two leaders during a joint press conference of the US President and the Indian Prime Minister at Hyderabad House
 pehle jawaab obama ko dena tha, or jab vah jawaab de rahe the, us vakt pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ishaara karke jaishankar ko apane paas bulaayaa, or kuch poocha, jabaki videsh sachiv sujatha singh saamne hi baithi thim
 All this did not appear on TV, but all the journalists present there realized that everything is not going well in the Ministry of External Affairs
 sabase badi baat yah he ki es jaishankar 31 janvari ko ritred ho rahe the isliye bhi yah faisla liya gaya
 Jaishankar speaks Russian language to Farrate and is also knowledgeable in the affairs of China
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ko lagata he ki obama prashasan ko 26 janvari kii yatra ke liye raji karne main es jaishankar bhi ahm role he
 The biggest question is what will happen to Sujatha Singh now? He has only one option to resign or go to Paris as ambassador

 i once asked him what film he was proudest of, he told me 'ardh Satya', where he played an idealistic young cop in a corrupt police force, was one of his first big lead roles and he had a soft spot for it

 He was someone who seemed to be doing it for the right reasons, still so humble and cool despite being an icon
 He remains an inspiration to so many
 Thank you Om-ji, for your incredible gift to us all

 Film Name: Bangistan Director: Karan Anshumanstar Cast: Ritesh Deshmukh, Pulkit Samrat, Jacqueline Fernandes, Chandan Roy Sanyal Duration: 135 Minutes Certificate: u / a Rating: 2 Star You know 'jolly LLB' Director Subhash Kapoor was a journalist first
 haal hi main relies hui film 'miss tanakpur hajir ho' ke diarector vinod kapadi bhi mashhoor patrakaron main se ek hai, or ab usee kram main patrakarita ke baad diarection ke kshetra main haath aajamaane ke liye taiyaar hai karan anshuman apni pehali film 'bangistan' ke saath
 Kahani This is the story of 'bangistan', a fictional country, with Hafiz bin Ali (ritesh Deshmukh) resident of the northern part and Praveen Chaturvedi (pulkit Samrat) from the southern part
 donon hi apane apane dharm main bahut yakeen rakhte hai
 The religious leaders of these two teach them their respective religions, and in the name of religion, go to Poland to fight a big battle
 is kaaran hafiz ab ishwarchand sharma (ritesh deshmukh) yani ek hindu kerup main or vaheempraveen chaturvedi bhi apana bhesh badalakar muslim allaah rakkha khan (pulakit samraat) ke rup main poland jaataa he, donon kaa ek hi makasad hota he, apane apane dharm ke liye badi ladaai ladanaa or praan nyochaavar kar dena
 a lot of events happen and eventually there is a lesson from this film
 scriptfilm kii kahani ek prayog he jise shaayad kuch log jajb kar len
 The film's first half brings many laughter moments
 jab aap is nae desh main bharat jaisi chizon ke naam sunate hai lekin jaise-jaise kahani aage badhane lagati he phir ubaasi aane lagati he
 The climax of the film is very weak which could have been better based on creativity
 jis tarah se 'pike' film main dharmagyaan ek alian ke dwaara bayaan kiya gaya tha
 At the same time, in this film, an attempt has been made to serve the religious message of two people living in a fictional country 'bangistan'
 abhinayaacting kii baat karen to ritesh deshmukh ne behtareen acting kii he, lekin kehete hai ki agar aapkaa ko-actor agar karact rispance na de, to aapke kaam par bhi asar padataa he
 During the acting of Pulkit Samrat, you see a copy of Salman Khan

 In a Facebook post, by releasing a list of 100 couples with inter-religious marriages, the so-called love jihad, openly called for an attack on them, the sensation has spread
 soshal media par is post ko lekar jamkar latad lagaai ja rahi he
 However, it is a matter of relief that Facebook has suspended this poison-spreading page named 'hindutva Dialogue', so this post is no longer visible
 times of india kii khabar ke anusaar is pej par khuleam 'hindu sheron' se aahvaan kiya gaya tha ki ve suchi main shaamil logon kaa shikaar karen
 a list of 102 men and women who have married in other religions has been released
 yahi nahin unke fasebukprophile kaa linkabhi share kiya gaya he
 This poisonous post was posted on the Hindutva Dialogue Facebook page on 28 January
 phek news kaa khulaasa karne vaali website alt news ke anusaar yah list iske pehle pichley saal november main hi 'justise for hindooj' fasebuk pej par jari kii gai thi
 However, no violence was called for in it then
 sabase chakit karne vaali baat yah he ki somvaar ko satish milaverpu naam ke ek twitor yujar ne khuleam kaha ki yah pej vah sanchalit karata he or usne kaha ki 'fasebuk par antar-dharmik shaadi karne waalon phir vah ek pej banayega
 ' He wrote,' i am proud to be the cadre of Hindutva talk page
 is par phir ek pej banaaungaa
 a Facebook spokesperson has said that his policy is to keep the society safe and prevent such poisonous thoughts
 jab bhi pataa chalata he aisi saamagree ko tatkaal hataa liya jaataa he
 The voice in this case was raised on Facebook by a Twitter user
 @brumbyoz naam ke twitor handle se hindutv vaarta pej ke virodh main 4 farvari ko post kiya gaya tha, jisamen is pej ko handle karne vaale logon kii giraftaar karne kii ummid bhi jataai gai thi
 It was also appealed to people on Twitter to protect their Facebook profiles and profiles on other social media platforms through privacy settings
 If you or someone you know is in a inter-community marriage plz make sure that the privacy settings on your facebook profiles are such that only trusted friends are able to access your profile

 ‚Äî Brumby (@brumbyoz)february 4, 2018 We consider Pitru
 jab tak kisi vyakti kii mrityu ke baad uskaa janm nahin ho jaataa vah sookshm lok main rahata he
 It is believed that the blessings of these fathers continue to be received by the family members through subtlety
 pitrupaksh main pitru dharti par aakar apane logon par dhyaan dete hai or aashirwad dekar unki samasyaayein dur karte hai
 In pitripaksha, we remember our fathers and follow charity in their memory
 is baar pitrupaksh 13 sitambar se 28 sitambar tak rahegaa
 How to follow the functions in Pitripaksha? - In Pitripaksha we offer water regularly to our fathers - this water is given in the afternoon by facing towards south direction- Black sesame is mixed in water and Kush in hand
 Rakha is kept - On the day when the ancestor's death date is given, food and clothes are donated on the same day - a poor person is also served food on the same day - after this the work of the ancestors ends Who can worship ancestors? - The senior male member of the house can perform the daily rituals - in his absence any male member of the house can do it - The grandson and grandson also have the right to tarpan and shraadh - the present Women can also perform Tarapan and Shraddha - just take care to obey the precautions of the ancestors but avoid doing things? - In this period both the Vela baths and keep the fathers It should be remembered that in the Kutap Vela, offer it to the fathers
 isi vela main tarpan kaa vishesh mahatv he- tarpan main kush or kaale til kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Doing tarpan with them gives amazing results- Anyone who follows Pitrupaksha should take only one Vela sattvic food during this period- Eat Satvik diet in Pitrupaksha
 pyaaj lahasun, maance madiraa se parhez karen- jahaan tak sambhav ho doodh kaa prayog kam se kam karen- pitaron ko halki sugandh vaale safed pushp arpit karne chahie , tikhi sugandh vaale phool varjit hai- dakshin disha kii ore mukh karke pitaron ko tarpan or pind daan karnaa chahie- pitrupaksh main nity bhagavadagita kaa paath karen- karj lekar yaa dabaav main kabhi bhi shraadh karm nahin karnaa chahie

 Both are accused of threatening a woman and sexually abusing her
 amboli police thane ke senior inspector ramesh khadtare ne kaha, ‚Äòmedia kansaltent punam khanna kii shikaayat ke baad sanaa khan, ismail khan or unke naukar raamu kanaujia ko ipisi kii dhara 354 (sheelbhang karne ke makasad se hamalaa karnaa), 506 (dhamkaana) or 34 (ek jaisi manshaa) ke tahat giraftaar kiya gaya
 The officer said the three accused were later produced in a court

 According to the police, Sana Khan, who starred in the Salman Khan starrer 'jai Ho', has also participated in the reality TV show 'bigg Boss' in 2012
 police kaa kahana he ki sanaa khan or unke bwoyfriend ismail ne ek akhbaar ke chape aalekh ke mudde par punam ko 21 oktober ko dhamkaaya

 Religion and caste have a great importance in the election history of India
 or yah mahatv upi main aakar or bhi bad jaataa he
 In the last Lok Sabha election (lok Sabha Election 2019), BJP had a big advantage due to the opposition being divided
 aise me is aadhaar par vot ke bantane kaa sidhaa phayda bijepi ko ho saktaa he
 However, unlike the previous election (lok Sabha Election 2019), this time Mayawati's BSP, Akhilesh Yadav's SP and Congress have tried to eliminate any possibility of votes being split
 2011 kii janaganana ke anusaar uttar pradesh main kul muslim aabaadi 19 fisadi he
 Which is more than the average 14 per cent Muslims living in the country
 jabaki upi main essi jati ke logon kul aabaadi main se 21 fisadi hai
 Whereas the total SC population in the country is 17 percent
 lekin uttar pradesh aise rajya main jahaan kii jansankhya duusare rajyon se kahi zyada he, ye aankde matadaataaon ke bade aankadon main tabadil ho jate hai
 According to the 2014 election data and exit poll, the Congress alone cannot influence the Yadav vote, which is why 80 per cent of such votes went to the accounts of Mayawati's BSP and Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party
 or congress yadavon kaa mahaj chaar fisadi vot hi le paane main safal hui thi
 On the other hand, if we talk about SC caste vote, 79 percent of the total vote percentage of caste went to Samajwadi Party and BSP
 jabaki congress essi jati kaa bhi teen fisadi vot hi apane khate main kar pai thi
 At the same time, BJP got 17 percent of the vote
 akhilesh yadav or mayawati kii party se jude netaa maanate hai ki is baar bhi congress kii vajah se unki party ko milane vaale vot pratishat main kisi tarah kaa badlaav nahin hoga
 However, he says that Congress can cut the upper caste vote that BJP gets this time
 aankadon par dhyaan den to ucch shrenee kii jati ke kul 67 fisadi vot bijepi ke khate main jate hai
 Whereas Congress talks about occupying 12 percent vote of this caste, which is much less than the 21 percent vote share of SP-BSP
 haalanki jab muslimon ke vot kii baat aati he to sapa-basapa or congress ke bich yah 80-20 fisadi ke antar se bantate hai
 However, this time people living in rural areas believe that this time Muslims can vote more in favor of Congress than before
 dilli main aparaadhiyon ke haunsale itane buland hai ki police bhi kai maamalon main laachaar najar aati he
 The latest example of this was seen when the man who became a witness in a murder case was shot and killed
 is katl ke baad logon ne aspataal main jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 The case is from Jahangirpuri area of delhi
 jahaan e block main ravivaar kii raat kareeb saadhe nau baje 27 varshiya jeet naamak yuvak kisi kaam se ja rahaa tha
 Then three unknown assailants gave that performance
 jeet ko is hamale main teen goliyaan lagi
 He was immediately rushed to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital, where doctors declared him dead
 jeet kii maut ke baad gussaye parijanon ne kai ghante tak aspataal main hangaamaa or todphod kii
 The matter did not stop here, some people also set fire to the slums near Jeet's house in K-block
 iske baad ilaake main tanaav kaa maahaul bana hua he
 In view of the situation, a large number of police forces have been deployed on the spot
 mritak jeet murder ke maamle mengvahatha
 He was also the plaintiff in this case
 ashanka he ki is hatya ke taar kahin naa kahin puraane hatyakand se jude ho sakate hai
 The police have registered a case
 lekin abhi tak kisi kii giraftaar nahin ho pai he
 The police is investigating the case
 uttar pradesh ke bhadohi jile main teen din pehle yani 23 farvari ko hue visphot ke liye jimmedaar mukhya aaropee kaliyar mansuri abhi tak police kii pahunch se baahar he
 The police are yet to arrest him
 aise main sawaal uth rahaa he ki aakhir wo kahaan gaayab ho gaya he? is maamle ko lekar police kii kaary pranali par sawaal uth rahe hai
 On 23 February, Bhadohi district resonated with a blast
 darasal, varanasi-bhadohi mukhya maarg par chauri ke rotiha main ek behad shaktishaalee visphot hua tha, jisamen kul 12 logon kii maut hui thi
 While three people were badly injured
 jinka ilaaj biechayu ke troma centre main kiya ja rahaa he
 In the incident, 9 weavers and 3 people of Bhadohi, a resident of Malda in West Bengal, were killed
 jisamen mukhya aaropee kaliyar mansoor ke 2 bete bhi shaamil hai
 However, the police have not yet reached Mansoor
 dhamaakaa kaise or kyon hua, is baat kaa khulaasa uski giraftaar se hi ho saktaa he
 But why the police have not been able to arrest him yet is a big question in itself
 haalanki sutron kaa daawa he ki police ne use hiraasat main liya he
 But the police officers are clearly denying this
 unka kahana he ki aaropee kii giraftaar ke prayaas lagaataar jari hai
 On one hand, people are troubled by the increase in criminal activities in the country, while there is also a village in this country where there is no crime
 chhattisgarh ke korba jile main ek aisa bhi gaanv he jahaan beete 107 saal se kisi bhi prakaar kaa jhagada-vivaad yaa chori-dakaiti nahin hui he
 So far no case of this village has reached the police station, if there is any dispute of this village, then settlement is made on the village's chaupal
 sarkaar ne ise adarsh gaanv ghoshit kar diya he
 Phuljhar, a village located 60 km from the district headquarters, is different from other places in the country because since 1907, there has been no fighting nor theft in this village
 yahaan kii chaoupal hi thana or nyaay kaa mandir he
 Here, Panch Parmeshwar decides and resolves the dispute
 yahi vajah he ki phooljhar ko aparaadh viheen adarsh gaanv ghoshit hone par mukhyamantri raman singh ne puraskrit kiya he
 Patel Ramlal, an elder in Phuljhar village, who has become an example for the state, says that he does not remember a single incident in which a case has reached the police station
 vah yuva avasthaa se hi gaanv ke mukhiya hai
 He said that there are minor disputes here too, but these are settled on the village chaupal
 unhone kaha ki panch parameshwar kaa faisla sabhi maanate hai
 Every soldier here is a soldier and he has the responsibility of protecting the village and the daughters-in-law here
 yahaan ke thane main rojnaama to hai, lekin aaj tak gaanv ke ek bhi vyakti kaa naam unamem darj nahin he
 Korba Superintendent of Police Ratanlal Dangi says that Phuljhar is an ideal village, which has been awarded the award for its zero crime
 isse anya gaanvon ke graminon ko bhi sikh leni chahie
 If all the villages in the state become like this, then nothing can stop Chhattisgarh from becoming a crime-free state

 In fact, early in his career he and senior BJP leader LK Advani were both journalists
 atal bihari raajnneeti main kaise aae iske peeche ek preranadayak kahani he
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee died at the age of 93 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi
 ek skool teacher ke ghar main paidaa hue vaajapeyi ke liye jivan kaa shuruaati safar aasaan nahin tha
 Born on 25 December 1924 in a lower middle class family of Gwalior, Vajpayee had his early education at Victoria (now Laxmibai) College in Gwalior and DAV College in Kanpur
 unhone raajnneeti vigyaan main post grajuation kiya or patrakarita main apana kariyar shuru kiya

 For this, he understood journalism as a better way and became a journalist
 khud atal bihari ne bataai preranounke patrkaar se rajaneta banane kaa jo jivan main mode aayaa, vah ek mahatvapurn ghatana se judaa he

 The ongoing controversy about Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati has now reached the political corridor as well
 isko lekar congress ke bheetar hi ghamaasan shuru ho gaya he
 Two veteran Congress leaders have come face to face over the Padmavati controversy
 purv kendriya mantri or congress netaa shashi tharur ne maharaajaaon ko kaayar bataaya, to jyotiraditya sindhiya ne jabardast palatwaar kiya he
 He advised that Shashi Tharoor should first read the history that what was the role of Maharajas? Also, such rhetoric should be avoided
 unhone kaha, ''main jyatiraditya sindhiya hum or mujhe apane ateet par garv he,''i think he should study history, i am Jyotiraditya Scindia and i am proud of my past: Jyotiraditya Scindia on Shashi Tharoor's Maharaja remarkpic
 twitter
 com / n6s7aqzefu‚Äî ANI (@ani)november 17, 2017iske alaava shashi tharur ke bayaan par bijepi ne bhi palatwaar kiya he
 Union Minister Smriti Irani tweeted and asked Shashi Tharoor whether all the Maharajas had bowed before the British? Smriti Irani also sought answers from Jyotiraditya Scindia, Diggi Raja and Amarinder Singh on this comment of Shashi Tharoor
 isse pehle kendriya mantri uma bharti, nitin gadakari samet tamaam mantriyon ne sanjay bhansaali par abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke naam par bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchane kaa aarope lagaate hue nishaanaa saadhaa he
 At the same time, on the Padmavati dispute, Congress leader Rajiv Shukla said that when such situations happen, it is the responsibility of the government and the I&B ministry to handle it
 agar kisi kii bhaavana aahat hoti he, to sarkaar us gut or film jagat ko baithkar samaadhaan nikaalnaa chahie
 After all, what did Shashi Tharoor say? There was a ruckus on the statement of former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor amid the uproar over the film 'padmavati'
 tharur ne kaha tha- asaliyat to yah he ki in tathakthith maharaajaaon main har ek jo aaj mumbai ke ek filmkaar ke peeche haath dhokar padey hai, unhen us samay apane maan sammaan kii koi chintaa nahin thi jab british inke maan-sammaan ko pairon tale rond rahe the
 They ran to save themselves
 to is sachai kaa saamana karo, isliye ye sawaal hi nahin he ki hamaari mileebhagat thi
 At a function, Shashi Tharoor was questioned as to why there is a sense of anguish in his book 'an Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India', while his opinion is that Indians supported the British
 is par tharur ne kaha, 'yah hamaari galati he or main yah sweekaar karata hum
 Truly, i do not justify suffering
 kitaab main darjanon jagahon par main khud par bahut sakht rahaa hum
 Some British critics have said why i do not explain how the British won? And this is a very fair question
 'tharur ke is bayaan par soshal media par kadi pratikriya ai
 People of Rajput society surrounded Tharoor by tweeting
 kya he padmavati par vivadacongress netaa shashi tharur kii yah tippanee aise samay main ai he jab sanjay lila bhansaali ke diarection main banifilm 'padmavati'ko lekar ek bada vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Some Rajput organizations have accused Bhansali of distorting history and serving Hindu sentiments
 haalanki, video jari kar sanjay lila bhansaali ne sandesh bhi diya tha ki unhone film puraa sanjidagi se banaai he or kisi kii bhaavana ko thes pahunchane jaisaa koi seen nahin he
 Despite this, there is a ruckus about Padmavati across the country
 congress mukhyalay ke conference room main mangalvaar ko jaise hi upi ke prabharee mahasaachiv gulam nabi aaazaad ne sapa or congress ke gathjod kii baat kahi, vaise hi baahar lon main jamaa gathjod ke samarthak or virdohi aapas main bhid gaye
 There is frustration among Congress workers over the discussion of Congress's alliance with Samajwadi Party
 congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki 24 se 36 ghanton main gathbandhan kaa elaan ho jayega, isse congress daftar main ikattha hue tamaam congress kaaryakarta yah sun kar naaraaz ho gaye
 He says that the Samajwadi Party is Bhasmasura and whoever came with the Samajwadi Party is over
 unka aarope he ki sapa gundon kii party he or usne itane saal upi main gundgardee kii, ab congress jab uske saath aegi to isse congress party ko baari nuksaan hoga
 Not only this, it will be difficult to win the election of 2019

 irom manipur main sashastr bal visheshadhikaar adhinium (afaspa) hataane ke liye 16 saal tak bhukh hadtaal kar chuki hai
 Iron Lady Irom Sharmila is doubly delighted on Mother's Day

 Renowned civil rights activist Irom Sharmila gave birth to girls in a hospital in Bangalore named Nix Shakhi and Autam Tara

 Significantly, Irom Sharmila has gone on hunger strike for 16 years to remove the Armed Forces Privilege Act (AFSPA) from Manipur

 Former Australian captain Ian Chappell believes the game has become batsmen-friendly again and bowlers can become 'extinct species' due to the practice of using heavy bats and shortening the boundary line in limited overs
 chapel ne kaha ki chauke or chakke manoranjan ke liye adhik dollar laa sakate hai, lekin yah khel ke liye acha nahin he, kyonki gendbaaj apni hadon ko paar kar sakate hai tathaa bodiline or chaking jaise tareeke apana sakate hai
 Chappell wrote in his column in espncricinfo, if the trend of heavier and better bats and shorter boundaries continues, the bowler may become an extinct species in shorter formats
 is chalan ke kaaran chaukon or visheshkar chhakkon kii taadaad main vruddhi ho rahi he
 It may be considered favorable for the match being played for the dollar, but its results will not be good in the long term
 unhone kaha, gendbaajon ko chote praroopon main sahare kii jarurat he or agar aisa nahin hua, to ve vidroh par utar jaaenge jaise ki pehle bhi ho chukaa he
 They can adopt methods such as bodyline and chucking
 yadi yahi chalan rahaa to aaj nahin to kal gendbaaj jang kaa elaan kar denge

 James Clapper, director of the US National Intelligence Department, said during a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, "india is very concerned about its disputed border and China's aggressive stance in the Indian Ocean and Asia Pacific
" " Clapper said, "the Indian Army believes that there is no hope of a major conflict between India and China soon, but the Indian Army is increasing its strength to prepare for limited conflict on the disputed border and Chinese power demonstration in the Indian Ocean Is working to balance
 " It may be noted that there was a brief war between India and China in 1962 and the boundary dispute still remains between the two
 sambandhon main sudhaar ke baavjood donon asian deshon ke bich vivaad lagaataar bane hue hai
 The official also said that India has supported America's strong military stance in East Asia and American access to Asia
 claper ne kaha ki america, pakistan ke saath sakaaratmak sambandh banaae rakhana chahta he, lekin unke hit aksar alag ho jate hai kyonki pakistan bharat ko apane astitv ke liye khatra maanata he
 Asked by the committee's vice-president, Saxby Chambliss, what was being done about the militants' hideouts in Pakistan, Clapper said it was being discussed with Pakistan
 claper ne kaha, "pakistani sainya adhikari alqaida sadasyon, anya videshi ladaakon tathaa islamabad ke liye khatra paidaa kar rahe pakistani aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf simit safalataa hi hasil kar paae hai
 " claper ne kaha ki bharat ne 2011 main afghanistan ke saath apana judaav paryaaptrup main badhaayaa he, lekin nikat bhavishya main vah afghanistan main sainik yaa baari upkarnon ko nahin bhejne vaala he, kyonki vah pakistan ko uksaana nahin chahta
 Clapper also said that although Iran is capable of making nuclear bombs, it is still unsure whether to build a nuclear bomb
 claper ne kaha, "iran ke raajnneetik halkon main is mudde (parmaanu hathiyaar nirmit kiya jaae yaa nahin) par matbhed or bahes jari he 
 " claper ne kaha ki parmaanu bam banane ke napha-nuksaan kaa akalan karne ke dauraan irani raajnneetijna is mudde par abhi ekamat nahin ho paae hai
 He said that although Iran is capable of producing nuclear weapons, it is not currently manufacturing it
 claper ne yah bhi kaha ki iran, pratikriyaswaroop america par hamalaa bhi kar saktaa he
 He said that the new sanctions of the US will have a major impact on Iran, but it will not fall the government there
 tippaniyan Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director David Petraeus also presented his testimony at the hearing
 unhone kaha ki iran par nae pratibandh kaaphi asarkaarak ho rahe hai, haal ke saptahon main zyada asarkaarak hue hai
 But it remains to be seen whether these sanctions will force Iran to change its conduct and its policies on the nuclear program
 gyaat ho ki raashtrapati baraak obama ne 31 disambar ko ek vidheyak par hastakshar kiye the, jisamen iran par nae pratibandhon ke praavdhaan shaamil the
 The bill targeted foreign financial institutions that do business with Iran's central bank
 america rashtriya khufia vibhaag ke nideshak james claper ne seenet kii khufia samiti ke samaksh ek sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha, "bharat apni vivaadit seemaa or hind mahaasaagar tathaa asia prashanth kshetra main china ke aakraamak rukh ko lekar bahut chintit he
 " claper ne kaha, "bhartiya sena maanati he ki bharat-china ke bich jald kisi bade sangharsh ke asaar nahin hai, lekin bhartiya sena vivaadit seemaa par simit sangharsh kii taiyaariyaan karne ke liye apni takat badha rahi he or hind mahaasaagar main chini shakti pradarshan ko santulit karne ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 " gyaat ho ki bharat or china ke bich 1962 main ek sankshipt yuddh hua tha or donon ke bich abhi bhi seemaa vivaad barkaraar he
 Despite the improvement in relations, disputes between the two Asian countries remain constant
 adhikari ne yah bhi kaha ki bharat ne purv asia main america ke majboot sainya rukh or asia main america pahunch kaa samarthan kiya he
 Clapper said that the US wants to maintain a positive relationship with Pakistan, but their interests often diverge because Pakistan considers India a threat to its existence
 samiti ke upaadhyaksh sexbi chamblis dwaara yah puche jane par ki pakistan main aatankwaadiyon ke panaahagaahon ke bare main kya kiya ja rahaa he, claper ne kaha ki is bare main pakistan ke saath baatcheet kii ja rahi he
 Clapper said, "pakistani military officials have been able to achieve limited success against Al Qaeda members, other foreign fighters and Pakistani terrorists posing a threat to Islamabad
" " Clapper said that India has substantially increased its engagement with Afghanistan in 2011, but it is not going to send troops or heavy equipment to Afghanistan in the near future, as it does not want to provoke Pakistan
 claper ne yah bhi kaha ki yadhyapi iran parmaanu bam banane main sakasham he, lekin vah abhi bhi is baat ko lekar anishchay main he ki parmaanu bam banaaya jaae yaa nahin
 Clapper said, "differences and debate continue on this issue (whether or not nuclear weapons are manufactured) in Iran's political circles
 " Clapper said that Iranian politicians have not yet agreed on this issue while assessing the pros and cons of making a nuclear bomb
 unhone kaha ki yadhyapi iran parmaanu hathiyaar banane main sakasham he, lekin philhal vah iskaa nirmaan nahin kar rahaa he
 Clapper also said that Iran could also attack the US in response
 unhone kaha ki america ke nae pratibandhon kaa iran par ek bada asar hoga, lekin isse vahaan kii sarkaar nahin girane vaali he
 The comments central intelligence agency (siie) ke nideshak david petrius ne bhi sunwaayee main apni gavaahi pesh kii
 He said that the new sanctions on Iran are becoming more effective, more effective in recent weeks
 lekin yah dekhnaa baaki he ki ye pratibandh kya iran ko apane aacharan or parmaanu kaarykram par apni nitiyaan badalane ke liye baadhya kar pate hai yaa nahin
 President Barack Obama signed a bill on 31 December that contained provisions for new sanctions on Iran
 is vidheyak ke jariye un videshi vittiya sansthaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya tha, jo iran ke kendriya bank ke saath kaarobaar karte hai
 Clapper said, "the Indian Army believes that there is no hope of a major conflict between India and China soon, but the Indian Army is increasing its strength to prepare for limited conflict on the disputed border and Chinese power demonstration in the Indian Ocean Is working to balance

 ‚Äô a post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) on May 9, 2018 at 6:52 pm PDT champaran satyagrah shatabdi varsh ke samaapan samaaroh ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kaarykram main swachhagrahiyon ne jamkar hangaamaa machaaya
 Sanitation volunteers from many states of the country created an uproar over the issue of wages in lieu of work

 Shortly after the commencement of the Prime Minister's speech, sanitation volunteers started creating a ruckus and left the venue
 pradhanmantri kaa virodh kar rahe swatchta swayamsevakon ne kaha ki pradeshon main vah kaam kar rahe hai
 There, they either do not get paid for their work or they get very little money
 madhya pradesh or bihar ke swachhagrahiyon ne kaha ki unhen rajya sarkaar ke dwaara unke kaam ke liye ‚Çπ1 bhi nahin miltaa he
 Angry sanitation volunteers said that they expected Prime Minister Modi to announce something for him when he comes to the event

 Due to the uproar in the Prime Minister's program, many BJP leaders present at the venue tried to pacify him but he did not agree
 graahakon ko lubhaane ke liye aksar falon ko chamkaaya jaataa he
 Be careful, do not let these fruits sold in the market spoil your health
 aaj falon main chamak laane ke liye varnish jaise rasayanon kaa istemaal khuleam ho rahaa he
 At the same time, traders are also using carbide powder indiscriminately
 doctoron kii maane, to isse maanav sharir main toxin kii maatra badhati jaati he or yah liver va kidney ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaata he
 According to doctors, only fruits and juices deliver mineral in the body
 par dukandaar khuleam falon ko chamakaane kii chaah main us par polish tathaa pakaane ke liye carbide kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 It is obvious that if it is eaten without washing, then the health of the person will deteriorate rather than become healthy
 aise falon ke khaane se isamen maujuud chemical sharir ke andar jaakar sharir ke argon ko kharaab kar sakate hai
 Especially the use of the most chemical-rich fruits causes liver damage
 baad main iskaa prabhaav sharir ke or hisson me padane lagata he
 Senior Physician Dr
 vijay shukla kehete hai ki falon ko ghar laakar khaane se pehle khub acchhee tarah se dhoen or uske baad hi istemaal karen
 Varnish or other harmful substances applied on the fruit without washing it can go into the body and damage internal organs
 unhone kaha ki fal kharidte samay is baat kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhen ki carbide se pake fal na khariden
 Along with the upper layer of such fruits, the elements inside it are also harmful
 viviipi helicopter ghotaale ko lekar hue vivaad ke bich sarkaar ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki saude ke bare main vah sibiai se report maangegi or agasta-westland or isaki mul company finamikainika ko blaclist karne kii pahal karegi
 The government also claimed that the previous UPA government had not imposed any restriction on the company involved in the scam
 endie ne kiya 2014 main company ko blaclystmodi sarkaar ke sheersh sutron ne daawa kiya ki rishwat ke aaropon ke baavjood agasta-westland ko upie sarkaar ke shasankaal main kaali suchi main nahin daalaa gaya or endie sarkaar ke 2014 main satta main aane ke baad daagi company ke sabhi adhigrahan prastaavon par roak lagaai gai thi
 The Congress had earlier claimed to have been blacklisted by the CBI in 2013 in connection with the alleged bribing by the company to deal with 12 helicopters for vvips including the President and Prime Minister
 congress ne daawa kiya tha ki agasta-westland ko upie sarkaar ke shasankaal main blaclist main daalaa gaya tha lekin modi sarkaar ne use kaali suchi se ‚Äòhataa‚Äô diya
 Congress leader and former Union Minister Anand Sharma had said, 'the helicopter deal was canceled
 upie sarkaar ne karrwai kii thi
 The then Defense Minister AK Antony made a statement in Parliament and agusta-westland was blacklisted
 ‚Äôparrikar ne di congress ko chunautibaharhaal sarkaar ke sutron ne kaha, ‚Äòcongress ne loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle janvari 2014 main ekmaatr dandatmak karrwai kii thi jab upie sarkaar ne bank guarantee ko jabt kar liya
 He never blacklisted the company as it is claimed
 ‚Äô isse pehle raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne congress ko chunauti di ki blaclist karne ke upie sarkaar ke aadesh ko vah dikhaae
 Sources said that on July 3, 2014, when Arun Jaitley was the defense minister, an order was issued in which all the purchase and acquisition cases lying in the pipeline were stayed

 The work of the District Magistrate and Chief Development Officer will be to prevent irregularities in the work done from the MLA fund
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ne in adhikariyon ko aadesh diya he ki jahaan bhi vidhayak nidhi se vikaas kaam ho rahe hai, unka sthaliy satyaapan or nirikshan karwaakar kaam kii gunvattta sunishchit karai jaae
 If any irregularity comes to light then the information will reach the government directly
 emele fund se hone vaale vikaas kaaryon main gunvattta kii kami ko lekar aae din shikaayatein aati rahati hai
 The displeasure of the complainants is that the work done by the public representatives' funds is not investigated and established
 aisa isliye kyonki kaam ke states or gunvattta par sawaal kar koi bhi adhikari vidhayakon ko 'naaraaz' nahin karnaa chahta
 The contractors benefit from this illegitimate
 yah paaya gaya he ki aise project ke jaanch or satyaapan kaa praavdhaan hone ke baavjood iskaa anupaalan nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The matter came up before the Assembly's Assurance Committee
 gram vikaas vibhaag ne pradesh ke sabhi jiladhikariyon or mukhya vikaas adhikariyon ko is sambandh main patr likhaa he
 In this, the officers have been asked to determine the quality of construction works approved under the scheme
 iske liye puure ho chuke nirmaan kaaryon or chal rahe nirmaan kaaryon kaa sthaliy satyaapan or nirikshan jarur kiya jaae

 zyada jaankaree ke lieyaha clic karen Since the launch of Reliance Jio's cheap 4G phones, news started coming that other companies can also launch such mobiles
 chunki jeeyo se sabase zyada nuksaan airtel ko hua he
 Hence it is believed that Airtel can announce cheap 4G phones soon
 iconomic times kii ek report ke mutabik bharti telecom diwali par 2,500 rupee ke 4G smartphone ke saath bandal ophers launch kar sakati he
 For this, the company is also in talks with handset manufacturers
 reliance jeeyo ne 0 rupee kii keemat ke saath jiophone kaa elaan kiya tha
 However, to buy it, you have to pay Rs 1,500 as security
 yani airtel 2,500 rupee main smartphone launch karegaa to aisa sambhav he ki wo jeeophone par baari pade
 Because jiophone will be a feature phone while Airtel will be a smartphone
 ET ne sutron ke hawaale se report main kaha he kii airtel 2,500 rupee kaa smartphone laaegaa jisamen feechar phone ke mukaable badi screen, behatar camera or parformens honge
 Apart from this, users can install the app in it through Google Play Store
 feechar phone kii apana dayera hota he, jabakismartphone main kaaphi sambhaavnaaenhoti hai
 Therefore, customers will look at the smartphone by putting Rs 1,000 more
 haalanki yah is baat par bhi nirbhar karegaa ki airtel is smartphone ke saath kaise ophers detaa he
 However, offering great features and specifications at this price is no less than a challenge
 hamane aapako isse pehle bhi bataaya he ki jeeyo ke baad handset companiyon par bhi saste 4ji phone launch karne kaa dabaav he
 Not only Airtel but Vodafone and Idea can also launch cheap 4G phones by partnering with handset companies
 isamen analimited data or colling di ja sakati he
 Currently, an Airtel spokesperson declined to comment on the matter

 This is what Anna Hazare wrote to Prime Minister Dr
 Manmohan Singh on Friday, August 26, 2011
 
 
 aadarneey dow
 Manmohan Singh ji, i owe a lot of gratitude to you and Parliament that you all respected our movement
 hamaare man main hamaari sansad ke prati apaar sammaan he
 Our Parliament is the holy temple of our democracy
 main anshan par apane kisi swaarth ke liye nahin baitha
 Just as you people are working for the good of the country, i also think about the people of the country
 mere paas kisi prakaar kii koi satta nahin he
 i am just a normal man and have a feeling of doing something for the society and poor people
 hamaara yah andolan kisi vyakti yaa party ke khilaaf nahin he
 We are against corruption
 bhrasht vyavastha ko badalanaa chaahate hai
 If there are some words uttered by me or my colleagues during our movement that have hurt you or any other person, i express my heartfelt behalf on everyone's behalf
 kisi ko bhi aahat karnaa hamaara makasad nahin he
 Due to corruption, it has become difficult for the common man to live in the country
 duniyabar main hamaare desh kii badanaami ho rahi he
 i hope this will be stopped in the coming days
 iske liye ham sabko milakar kaam karnaa hoga
 Rules, rules, laws are for the public, not for the public
 yadi bhrashtachar ko turant rokane ke liye hamen turant kuch nae kaayade banane pade yaa kuch kanoon badalane bhi paden to hamen hichakana nahin chahie
 When a common man grinds due to corruption, i do not tolerate it
 aam aadmi ko pis rahe bhrashtachar ko rokane ke liye janalokapal bill main teen praavdhaan hai - - har rajya main isi kanoon ke zarie lokayukta bhi banaae jaaen
 Every department should make a civil code for public problems, which will be punished by the officer concerned for not accepting it
 - upar se neeche tak kendra sarkaar ke sabhi karmchaaree lokapal ke daayre main laae jaaen or isi tarah rajya sarkaar ke karmchaaree lokapal ke daayre main hon
 Can the proposal of these three things be brought in the Parliament? i hope not only, that all our mps will agree on these three things in the beginning, to rid the people of the country of daily corruption
 meri antaratma kahati he ki in baton par sansad main sahmati hone par main apana anshan tod duun
 Other things of Jan Lokpal, such as the selection process etc
, are also very important to prevent corruption
 main meri janata ke saath tab tak ramlila maidan main baitha rahoonga, jab tak baaki muddon par sansad main nirnay nahin ho jaataa, kyonki yah janata kii aawaaj he
 i call on you and all mps to participate in this movement going on against corruption across the country
 yah sabhi kaa desh he or ham sabhi ko milakar ise sudhaarna hoga
 Sincerely ba
 And Anna Hazare amitabh bachchan ko jo cheez prabhavit karti he, ve uski khulkar prashansa karte hai
 He is currently immersed in a TV series
 ye he british period drama tivi siries 'da crown'
 Amitabh is very impressed with the characters of this TV series
 unhone apane blog par likhaa he ki ve in kirdaaron ke swabhaav ko aatmsaat karte hai
 However, he has not mentioned these characters
 big bi likhte hai, is siries ke kirdaar apane aap hi darshakon ko prabhavit karne lagate hai
 They are so surprising that family members come around you and ask, are you okay? i mean i am fine, but the characters in this serial are not good
 ve kisi tarah ham main bane rahete hai or ham khud ko apni rosemara kii jindagi main punerjeevit karte hai
 Amitabh's answer is no, despite the pain, Rishtey Amitabh wrote, "I had started seeing this serial as a character from the time of Queen Elizabeth 2
 usamen shaamil mahasoos kiya, jo ghatnaayen us samay huin
 We become little princes by our conduct
 bataa den ki ye tivi siries british royal family or rani elizabeth2 ke samay kii kahani he
 This is the story of the latter half of the 20th century
 isamen unki shuruyaat se lekar ab tak kii kahani bataai gai he
 Fan asked, is money everything? Big b gave this answer: 14 people died in a heartbreaking incident of fire in the Kamla Mill pub in Mumbai
 is dardanaak haadase par soshal media par sakriy rahane vaale big bi kii ore se koi sandesh nahin aayaa
 An angry fan of this has lodged his complaint in harsh words
 apane fain kii shikaayat kaa jawaab bhi amitabh bachchan ne diya
 Not only this, he posted this entire incident on social media
 rohit borade naam ke shaks ne fasebuk par likhaa ki mumbai rahakar kabhi kisi durghatana ke bare main, na hi twit kiya na fasebuk post
 
 
 Never expressed condolences
 paisa hi sabakuch nahin he
 i will always be a fan
 jab amitabh ke liye rajesh khanna ne cancel kar di thi shootingis post ke baad mahanayake amitabh bachchan ne bade hi vinamr bhav se jawaab dete hue likhaa, sahi kaha aapane, nahin karata main
 Because here only sensations will be propagated, not real sensations
 yahaan samvednaa dikhaava he
 
 
 for the people
 
 But what did he do for it? You can tell, what can you do with such an accident? When i have to do something, i do it
 aapako yaa kisi or ko nahin boluungaa, kyonki wo prachaar hoga
 
 
 No condolences
 paise ke saath aisi durghatana yaa apane vichaardhaara mat joden
 
 
 By doing this you are expressing your weakness yourself

 In Rewa, an elderly man was threatened with a pension for not being sterilized
 ''aise vaakyon kii ginati nahin
 Raju, 32, a Mandla resident, works as a laborer in Bhopal
 uske bete ko kute ne kaat liya to anti rabies injection lagavane ke badale raju ko nasbandi karwaani padi
 In Raju's own words, "I had no money to inject my son
" jepi aspataal gaya to doctoron ne kaha ki nasbandi karvaa lene par injection muft main lag jayega
 See the case of 80-year-old fifth son of Rewa
 unhen to bipiel kii suchi main naam banaae rakhane ke liye nasbandi karaane ko majaboor kar diya gaya
 Interestingly, geographical and other features of different areas were taken care of to motivate the government staff
 gwalior-chambal kshetra main nasbandi karwaane kii prerana dene waalon ko bike se lekar bandook ke license tak kaa laalach diya gaya
 1,100, if you get a sterilization somewhere by fraud
 kaa hi laalach dekar nasen kaat di gayi
 Leader of the Opposition Ajay Singh even alleged that "madhya Pradesh has undergone more sterilization in the last two years than the Emergency
" ''reva jile ke ramchandra namdev kii nasbandi to sidhe-sidhe dhamkee dekar kii gai
 To the 65-year-old Namdev, Patwari of the village said that if he does not undergo sterilization, his old age pension will be stopped and the name will also be cut from the BPL list

 For this reason, the government gave the district collectors the goal of sterilization, which the district collectors pressurized the employees to achieve
 swasthya vibhaag se jude ek varisht adhikari bataate hai ki kuch shikaayatein aisi bhi milin jinamein patwaariyon ne jameen ke jhagade, namataran se jude maamle nibatane ke badale gaanv ke logon par nasbandi karwaane kaa dabaav banaaya
 Salaries of health supervisors were withheld in many districts
 lakshya ko puraa kar jald se jald vetan paane ke liye unhone bhi logon ko bahala-phuslaa kar nasbandi ke liye raji kar liya
 In many places, the network was also formed for the distribution of incentives for the operation
 gauratlab he ki nasbandi karwaane waalon ko 1,100 ru
 Mills while the motivator encouraging for sterilization costs 150-200

 Pushpa Gupta, the joint director (health) of Ujjain justifies the pressure being created to achieve the target

 In this way, 52-year-old Anand Mohan has now got many more years to write poems from behind bars
 is faisle kaa nishchit arth is rajput netaa or uski rajnatik mahatvakankshaon ke liye saare raste band hona ho saktaa he

 In 2009, while hearing a case in Chhattisgarh, the Supreme Court had ruled that in case of life imprisonment, a convict would have to undergo a minimum of 14 years of imprisonment and would have no right to be released automatically after 14 years
 
 jaahir he, anand mohan kaa kai saal ke liye saarvajanik jivan se dur rahanaa tay he
 Earlier in October 2007, the lower court sentenced Anand Mohan to death, but the Patna High Court later reduced his sentence to life imprisonment, a decision that has been agreed by the Supreme Court
 kya mohan bihar kii raajnneeti main apni praasangikta kho chuke hai? kya us netaa ke liye saare raste khatm ho chuke hai, jiske liye unke samudaay main ab bhi sahanubhuti he? iskaa jawaab haa main bhi he or na main bhi
 Mohan's political career is over now
 use sunai gai sajaa use pehle hi chunaav ladane ke ayogy bana chuki he
 Now, the final verdict has confirmed that he is no longer able to campaign for many years to come
 raajnneeti jaise krur peshey main sahanubhuti alpajivi hoti he or vafadari-agar aapaki bahut acchhee haisiyat nahin he-bhi samay ke saath ghatati chali jaati he
 But Bahubali leaders still have a brand value in Bihar
 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle, bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne mohan ke paitruk ghar jaakar sab ko hairat main daal diya tha
 There he openly sought blessings from Mohan's mother
 mohan kii maa ke saath nitish kii mulaakaat ne lalu prasad kii argedy ko itnaa pareshaan kar diya ki unhone apni party ke pramukh mahasachiv or rajyasabha saansad ramkripal yadav ko do baar saharsa jail bheja tha, taaki jail main band purv saansad ke saath 'raajnneeti par charchaa' kii ja sake
 They had no effect on Mohan
 doshi sabit hone ke baad sahanubhuti kii lahar se baari aas lagaae mohan ne apni patni lavali anand ko alamnagar nirvachan kshetra se congress ke tikat par chunaav maidan main utaara tha, jahaan se unki jamaanat jabt ho gai thi
 In the heterogeneous and factional society of Bihar, where caste is often the most decisive aspect of politics, Mohan can still voice his helplessness to gather some votes for his wife and political bosses
 agar unhen bihar ke rajnatik paridrishy main khud ke liye koi bhi ummid najar aati he to vah yah acchhee tarah jaanate honge ki unki bhoomika ek mohare bhar kii rahegi
 They will only provoke emotions, and expect the tears to turn into votes
