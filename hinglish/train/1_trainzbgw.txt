 From Ferozepur Jhirka seat, BJP has given a chance to Nasim Ahmed, while Zakir Hussain has been fielded from Nuh seat
 mevaat kshetra main aane vaali ye wo vidhansabha siten hai jahaan se muslim pratyaashee ke alaava kabhi kisi ko jeet nahin mil saki he
 The main reason for this is the Muslim population here

 aise main bijepi ne bhi is baar muslim chehron par daanv lagaaya he
 Not only this, the leaders who have been given tickets by the BJP are considered to hold a lot in the area
 ferozepur se naseem ahamed ke sahare bijepiferozepur jhirka vidhansabha seat mevaat kii behad ahm seat maani jaati he or bijepi ne yahaan se naseem ahamed ko tikat diya he
 Naseem Ahmed won the 2014 assembly election on INLD (INLD) ticket from this seat
 isse pehle 2009 main bhi naseem ahamed INLD ke tikat par hi is seat se jite the
 That is, Nasim Ahmed, who has been winning the INLD ticket for two consecutive terms from this seat, is now trying his luck as a BJP candidate

 On the question of how the Muslim community's distance from the BJP is often talked about, how will they be able to move forward? On this question, Nasim Ahmad said that unless you go close to someone, then the things said about them will be Looks right naseem ahamed ne kaha ki bijepi ko lekar jo dharna he, wo bebuniyaad kii upaj he or hakeekat isse alag he
 Are mob lynching-triple divorces issues? When asked on the BJP ticket from the Muslim-dominated assembly constituency, Nasim Ahmad, when asked if there are issues of mob lynching and triple talaq for the public in his area, he replied Gave that Mewat is the place where there is never any communal riots nor any incident like mob lynching has happened here
 naseem ahamed ne spasht kaha ki mevaat kii janata ko vikaas kii jarurat he or yahi vajah har dharm ke log bijepi ko samarthan dene kaa mood bana chuke hai
 So, there is no issue like triple talaq or mob lynching here
 mevaat main banegaa itihasamevaat main kya is baar bijepi kaa camel khil paaegaa, is sawaal par naseem ahamed kaaphi aashwast dikhe
 He said that the Khattar government has done a lot of work for Mewat
 aise main unhen puri ummid he ki mevaat main is baar itihaas banegaa or bijepi ko yahaan jeet milegi

 India Today's special investigative team has exposed the country's biggest land scam

 india today ne aise napak gathjod se nakaab hataaya he jo farji tareeke se in vishaal sansadhano ko bechney main laga he
 An investigation by the Undercover Reporters of India Today Network revealed how this widespread fraud is being carried out right under the nose of the State Waqf Boards
 rajya vakf bordon ko aisi sampattiyon kaa nigahebaan (rakhwala) mana jaataa he
 India Today, under its investigation, first turned to the Waqf Mosque in Meerut and Mutavalli Qamar Ahmed of the Mazar
 is masjid or majaar ko ‘sampatti 3068’ bhi kaha jaataa he
 Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board had chosen Qamar Ahmed as the keeper of the charitable estate, while citing very strict rules on the papers
 india today kii pahunch aise dastavej tak hai jinke mutabik qamar ahamed ko bina aadhaarik anumati liye sampatti ko bechney, lij par dene yaa punarnirmaan kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 But Qamar Ahmad, who is also a lawyer himself, considering this large religious property as his personal estate, started swapping it for illicit cash
 india today ke under cover repotars se qamar ahamed ne kaha ki 800 varg gaj, thik thik kahen to 680 varg gaj jameen ko aapke naam main sthanantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 The reporter asked, "will this all happen in a legitimate way?" Qamar Ahmed insisted, yes, it can only happen tomorrow if you want
 qamar ahamed ne daawa kiya ki use 3068 aukaaf ke liye bikri or lij registration, donon ko anjaam dene kaa adhikaar he
 Ahmed also showed a permission letter to support his point which turned out to be fake
 3068 aukaaf sampatti ko bechney sambandhi is anumati patr kii ek prati ko uttar pradesh central sunni vakf board ke sahaayak sachiv aale atik ko lakhanu main dikhaaya gaya
 Aale Atiq made it clear that in the last 35 years no permission letter was issued to sell any akaaf

 ’lekin koi keretekar kaise daan di gai sampada ko khud se bech saktaa he?qamar ahamed kii maani jaae to wo nishchit rup se aisa kar saktaa he, bas iske liye use lakhanu main board tak bhi hissaa pahunchaana hoga
 Qamar Ahmed clarified the matter and said, 'after giving them part, i will have nothing special left
 mujhe unhen 25 fisadi dena padegaa
 "the reporter wanted to know, would this part go to the Waqf Board? Qamar Ahmed's answer was-" Yes, i will do everything through his inspector
 sab kuch sahi tareeke se kiya jayega
 I've done this before
 ’ye ghotaalaa kisi ek shaks yaa ek jagah tak hi simit nahin he
 In Sitapur, India Today turned to Chaudhary Abdul Hameed, caretaker of Waqf property number 4181

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 maharashtra ke bid zile se borkhed gaanv se ek kisaan raaje bhonsle ne hamen phone kiya
 Raje had been arguing for the acquisition of land at prime time for two days, but Raje felt that there was a big shortage
 bhoomi adhigrahan bill kii baton ko lekar adarshavaadi daawey ho rahe hai or aalochana ho rahi he, lekin zamin par kisaan kya bhugatta he wo iskaa hissaa nahin ban rahaa he
 Although we included the experiences of some farmers in Tuesday's prime time, Raje Bhosle's personal experience shows what is happening to the farmers
 to aapako raaje kii aapbeetee sunaata hum
 In 2003, 12 acres of Raje Bhonsle land were acquired for the Borkhed storage tank
 muaavze kii raashi tay hone se pehle hi zamin kaa adhigrahan ho gaya
 Raje kept traveling to different offices for three years
 adhikariyon ko apane kharche par khet tak le gaye
 After that, in 2006, two departments together measured their land, but the price could not be fixed
 is bich unki zamin par tanks banane kaa kaam 75 fisadi puraa ho gaya
 Seven years later, in 2013, the amount of compensation was fixed
 raaje bhonsle or anya kisaanon kii zamin ke liye muawza tay hua ek karod 9 lakh rupee
 However, it was found that half of the amount for the project has been spent on the construction of the tank
 lihaaza muaavze kii raashi ke liye nai file bani or manzuri ke liye bid se aurangabad laghu jalasansaadhan ke cirkil daftar bheji gai
 The file has been stuck there for eight months
 agar aurangabad cirkil offis se clear bhi ho jaati to ise pune ke division aphis main bheja jayega
 The file from Pune will come to the Watershed Board of Aurangabad and from there to the Ministry of Mumbai
 mumbai ke mantralay se project kii raashi clear hokar bid aegi tab jaakar raaje bhonsle ko muawza milegaa
 There may be some errors due to phone conversations but tell you that the distance from Beed to Aurangabad is 135 km
 aurangabad se pune kii duuri 250 kimi or chunki file pune se aurangabad hokar mumbai jaaegi isliye opeko bataa den ki aurangabad se mumbai kii duuri 550 kimi he
 In 10 years, Raje Bhonsle's file could run only 135 km
 ab aate hai dilli
 The Prime Minister called a meeting of his senior colleagues on land acquisition
 is baithak main rajnath singh, sushma swaraj, arun jetali, venkaiya naidu samet kai mantri the
 Apart from the Akali Dal and Shiv Sena, another ally of the government, Lok Janshakti Party, also started protesting
 pradhanmantri ne vipakshi dalon ko alag alag bulaakar baat karne kii prakriya bhi shuru kii he
 The Prime Minister has also met Sharad Pawar
 saaf he ki sarkaar ab bill ko us rup main nahin paa paaegi jis rup main chaahati thi par jo nayaa bill aayega kya kisaan yaa vipakshi dal usase santusht ho jaaenge
 Simultaneously, the government also decided that it would respond to the propaganda of the opposition parties
 iske liye kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari patrakaron ke bich adhyadesh kii kapi lekar aa gaye or bataane lage
 However, this should have been done by Union Rural Development Minister Chaudhary Virendra Singh, whose ministry has this bill
 ham patrakaron kii aadat hi ho gai he har baat main kami nikaalane kii lekin jo sarkaar kii taraf se nitin gadakari ne kaha uske kuch bindu is prakaar hai
 The UPA government did not keep the study of social impact in the 13 Act
 isse hamaara kuch lenaa dena nahin he
 Gadkari said that in the fourth schedule of the law, the study was removed by the UPA and not by the NDA
 lekin vittamantri ne to blog main likhaa tha ki saamaajik asar ke adhyayan jaise praavdhaanon se kai project ko puure hone main varshon lag jaaenge
 This will reduce the pace of development
 tab ye bhi to likh sakate the ki upie ne hataaya tha hamane nahin
 But anyway
 sarkaar baar-baar jor de rahi he ki usne muaavze or punarvaas ko lekar koi samjhauta nahin kiya he
 Nitin Gadkari read 10-A of the ordinance and said that the land comes in the list of both the state and the center
 gadakari ji ne kaha ki sahmati kaa jahaan tak prashn he wo rajya sarkaar kii marji par nirbhar he
 We have suggested that for projects such as defense production in the border areas, consent and social impact studies will not be a requirement
 gaanv main bijli, sadak banane ke liye bhi sahmati or saamaajik asar ke adhyayan kii zarurat nahin rahegi
 Nitin Gadkari tried to explain with an example that 80 percent of the land in this country is acquired for irrigation schemes
 2000 acre kaa project hota he lekin sinchai pariyojna se 3 lakh acre tak kisaanon ko phayda hota he
 If we acquire 2000 acres of land after 80 percent consent, then how can we make a project to provide water to poor farmers of the country
 raaje bhonsle kii vyathaa katha jo pehle sunai use bhi yaad rakhiyegaa
 Well by evening, Akhilesh Sharma reported that the government is ready for some changes, according to his sources, amendments will be made to the controversial provisions of the bill
 vivaadaaspad praavdhaanon kii bhashaa badali jaaegi
 The government will own the land under PPP model
 industrial koridor main sadak se ek-do kilometre zamin kaa hi adhigrahan hoga
 Under the social structure, only government schools, hospitals will become private schools, not hospitals, etc
 sahmati or saamaajik prabhaav adhyayan yani Social Impact Assessment ke praavdhaan or spasht kiye jaaenge
 Negotiations are ongoing with the RSS, allies, farmer organizations and opposition parties for amendments

 com / ywxqyg4ciu In 2019, the journey of Virat Kohli-led Team India ended with a painful defeat in the semi-finals
 semifinal main team india kaa rasta rokane vaali newjiland lagaataar duusari baar final main pahunchane main kaamyaab rahi to bharat ko lagaataar duusari baar semifinal se hi baahar hona padaa
 India will now wait for 2023 to become world champion for the third time
 team india ko is world cap kaa sabase majboot daavedaar mana ja rahaa tha, lekin bhartiya team kaa safar semifinal main samaapt ho gaya
 The world got a new world champion in this World Cup
 england ne pehali baar world cap kii trophy par kabja jamaaya, wo bhi usee newjiland kii team ko maat dekar jisane bharat ko toornament se out kiya tha
 Kohli lost 2 ICC tournaments in 2 years, Virat Kohli was given full command of Indian cricket team in 2014
 mahendra singh dhoni ke test team se captaini chhodane ke baad kohli ko captaini kii jimmedaari di gai
 In January 2017, Dhoni also relinquished the captaincy from the limited-overs format, after which Kohli was also given the command of odis and T20s
 kohli apni captaini main isisi ke 2 bade toornament main bharat kii aguwai kii, lekin kisi main bhi vah jeet nahin dilaa paae
 In the ICC Champions Trophy -2017, Team India lost in the finals and in the World Cup-2019, they had to be eliminated from the semi-finals
 dhoni ke ran out se tutaa sapanaworld cap-2019 ke dauraan dhoni apni dhimi ballebaaji kii vajah se aalochakon ke nishane par rahe
 He was run out in the semi-finals against New Zealand, only to be blown away by India's hopes
 team india ke world cap se baahar ho jane ke baad dhoni ne antarrashtriya cricket se brake le liya
 After the World Cup, Dhoni spent 15 days in Kashmir with the Territorial Army Unit
 vah world cap ke baad se ab tak kisi bhi international cricket siries kaa hissaa nahin rahe hai
 The team remained dependent on the top order
 In this tournament, the matches played by Team India, the top order and bowlers played a big role
 semifinal main newjiland ke khilaaf team india ke top-3 ballebaajon ne behad ghatiya pradarshan kiya
 Openers Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli were dismissed by just 1-1 runs
 vanade itihaas main aisa pehali baar hua jab kisi team ke top-3 ballebaaj 1 ran ke nijee score par out hue hon
 The Indian team had lost 3 wickets on the score of 5 runs
 batting order manage karne par nahin diya dhyanis world cap ke aakhri daur main team india apane plaing-11 ko lekar aatmavishvaas se bhari najar nahin ai
 Excluding Mohammed Shami in the semi-finals was shocking
 is toornament main shami ne damdaar pradarshan kiya tha
 However the Indian bowlers did well against New Zealand
 semifinal main chaar wicketipurs ke saath khilne kaa bhi koi matlab nahin banataa tha
 This caused problems in managing batting orders
 number-4 ko lekar nahin dikhe syriasis world cap main team india number-4 par ballebaaji ke liye cheharaa talashti rahi
 This discovery did not end even after reaching the semi-finals, the result of which Team India suffered as a defeat
 chayankartaaon ne vijay shankar, dinesh karthik, lokesh rahul or kedaar jadhav ko chunaa tha
 But all these names failed at number-4 in this World Cup
 haalanki, rahul ne bangladesh ke khilaaf abhyaas match main chauthe number par khelte hue shatak jarur jamaaya tha, lekin shikhar dhawan ke chotil hone ke kaaran unhen rohit sharma ke saath pari kii shuruyaat karne kii jimmedaari di gai

 pichley 25 saalon se film industry main maujuud actor saf ali khan apni filmon se hameshaa darshakon kaa manoranjan karte aae hai
 Saif will soon be seen in the film 'phantom'
 saf kii yah film 26 \ 11 hamalon par besd he
 Saif will be seen in the role of an army officer in the film
 jab hamaari team ne baat kii saf se to unhone film ke bare main kai mjedaar baaten bataayin
 Why is the film named 'phantom'? 'phantom' is a good title for an action film
 ek aisa aadmi jiske bare main zyada koi nahin jaanata, ek rahasy tip kaa he jiske marane se bhi kisi ko koi fark nahin padegaa
 It is a human on a mission called 'phantom'
 yah film hossain jaidi kii nowell par aadhaarit he, kya aapane vah kitaab padhi he?maine nahin padhi kyonki kabir khan ne kaha tha mat padho, screenple thodaa alag he
 But i know a lot about the story of the book
 aap film main kya kar rahe hai?ection film he, deshbhakti kii bhaavana he, jin logon ne 26 / 11 kaa hamalaa kiya, un hamalaavaron ko sajaa dene kii koshish karata hua film main dikhaai duungaa
 What was the reason for your film 'agent Vinod' not being able to run? We did it but it could not work, maybe we did not make the right film
 lekin is baar kabir khan kii film 'agent vinod' se kaaphi alag he
 You can just say that 'agent Vinod' was my rehearsal for 'phantom'
 kya aapane shooting ke dauraan diarector ko apana opinian bhi diya tha?ji nahin, kabir bahut achche filmkaar hai or main diarector ko jarur sunata hum
 Kabir's Bajrangi Bhaijaan did well, do you think the audience's expectations have also increased with this film? If people come to see Kabir's film then it will be a big thing for us too
 har film kii takadir hoti he, 'bajrangi bhaijan' ek positive tip kii film he
 Phantom film is very different from 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', the same director has made both films but the treatment is different
 aapako lagata he ki bharat main muslim asurakshit hai?pataa nahin, mujhe lagata he ham sabko ek duusare ke dharm kaa sammaan karnaa chahie, agar apnaanaa mushkil samajhate hai to kam se kam izzat karen
 Salman had commented on some tweeters, after that he had to apologize? Yes, we all should have the freedom to speak, if we have to apologize by writing on Twitter then what is the benefit, Twitter should be just for spreading news
 aajkal khud hi log news ban jate hai
 How do we see success and failure? i think we have been working for 25 years, sometimes the wrong things are noticed, so now i should pay attention to what kind of film to do
 aapane alag-alag filmon ke saath prayog bhi kiye hai jaise 'go goa gon' or 'happy anding'
 There was a time when we could make anything in production like 'love Nowadays,' Cocktail, 'but we want to make more good films now
 'bajrangi bhaijan' dekhne ke baad maine sochaa he ki ek hero kaa kirdaar kitna ahm ho saktaa he
 i sometimes feel that my thinking is quite Western
 lekin ab mujhe alag tarah se soch kar kuch alag karnaa chahie
 i think one should work with a good director
 kamedi filmein nahin karenge?main acchhee kamedi film main kaam jarur karnaa chaahunga
 How was working with Katrina? She takes a lot of interest in all things
 jaise abhi reality sho main jane se pehle kaaphi plan kar rahi thi
 They work hard and are good
 film 'di de' or 'baby' jaisi kahi ja rahi he

 ) Bollywood actress Shraddha Kapoor made her debut in the industry in 2010 with the film Teen Patti
 lekin shraddha ko pahchaan mili aashiqui 2 se
 Now Shraddha Kapoor is going to be seen in Saaho film with Bahubali fame Prabhas
 saaho isi maheene 30 agast ko relies ho rahi he
 Shraddha Kapoor has done almost 17 films in her 9-year career
 is avadhi main shraddha teen bade projects kaa bhi hissaa bani hai
 But despite doing such big projects, Shraddha Kapoor is not in the list of top actresses
 isaki kai vajahen hai
 # 1
 mail star besd filmdarasal, shraddha kapur ne ab tak kai filmein aisi kii hai jo hit to huin, lekin unka shrey shraddha ko nahin mila
 Like- Hyder, rebel, woman
 ye teen aisi badi filmein hai, jinhone box offis par kamai ke saath prashansa bhi hasil kii
 The heroes took full credit for the success of these films
 haidar main shahid kapur or tabboo ke kaam ke aage shraddha kapur dab si gayi
 While Tiger's Shroff's dance and action in Baghi was very heavy on Shraddha
 stri main to shraddha kapur ko lead mili, magar sara jaadu rajkumaar raav or pankaj treepathi le ude
 Shraddha shares what was left with Aparshakti Khurana
 ab saaho main shraddha, prabhas ke apojit hai, aisa star jiske aage shraddha ko jagah bana paanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Although the teaser so far, Shraddha's character in the trailer looks strong
 # 2
 Number 1 in Dance, Zeroshraddha Kapoor has acted in many dance based films
 inamen abisidi 2 shaamil he
 Many films were dance based even if Shraddha's dance number was a hit
 shraddha shandaar dancer hai isamen koi do raay nahin he
 His upcoming film is Street Dancer
 magar acting ke maamle main shraddha zyada kamaal nahin dikhaa saki hai
 The actress who left a mark in her films is rarely seen
 # 3
 Experimentation with the characters: Shraddha Kapoor has not done any special experiments with the characters in the films so far
 haa, unki ek film "hasina parkar" jarur ai, jisamen shraddha kapur ne femail gangster kaa lead kirdaar nibhaane kii koshish kii thi
 But Shraddha Kapoor could not carry this character on screen
 darshakon ne bhi hasina parkar ko buree tarah se khaarij kar diya
 Hence, the film proved to be a super flop at the box office
 critics ne bhi kaha ki shraddha kapur ne film main over acting kii
 Now Shraddha Kapoor is going to do the biggest budget film in her career as Saaho
 dekhnaa ye hoga ki saaho shraddha kapur ke kariyar main kis tarah kii film sabit hoti he
 Whether the actress gets the benefit of it or not

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has already won a big and historic victory in this Lok Sabha election
 yah pehali baar he jab bijepi ne pashchim bengal main jabardast paith banaai he
 Before this, the popularity of the Left parties and Trinamool Congress has been waving here for a long time
 2011 se ab tak pashchim bengal mamata banerjee kaa garh rahaa he or bijepi yahaan kabhi bhi do ankon tak seat laa paane main kaamyaab nahin hui thi
 This time the BJP was giving a lot of attention to West Bengal and that is why PM Narendra Modi held the most rallies here after Uttar Pradesh
 india today data intelegence unit ne pashchim bengal kii loksabhaa siton ke aankadon kaa vishleshan kiya or paaya ki pashchim bengal main bijepi kaa pradarshan kaaphi acha rahaa, lekin saatven or antim charan main jin 9 siton par matdaan hua tha, unamem se bijepi ek bhi seat nahin jeet saki
 bjp's phase-wise lead By the sixth phase in West Bengal, the BJP won at least two seats in each phase
 pehle or duusare charan main bijepi ne sabhi siten jeet leen, tisare charan main paanch main se do siten jeetin
 In this phase two seats were won by Trinamool Congress and one by Congress
 chauthe charan main bijepi ne 3 or trinmul ne 4 siten jeetin, jabaki congress ko ek seat mili
 The BJP also won 3 seats in the fifth phase, while the Trinamool won 4 seats
 chhathwein charan ke dauraan chunaav prachaar kaaphi tanaavpurn ho gaya or is charan main bijepi ko 8 main se paanch siten milin, jabaki is charan main trinmul ko sirf teen siten milin, lekin saatven charan main pashchim bengal kii 9 siton par chunaav hua tha or sabhi siten trinmul ne jeet leen
 The BJP did not get a single seat from the state in the last phase
 in 9 siton main damdam loksabhaa seat ko chhod den to sabhi siton par jeet kaa antar kam se kam ek lakh rahaa
 The winning margin in Dum Dum was 52,000 votes
 antim charan ke matdaan main pashchim bengal kii 9 siten— basirahaat, diamond harbar, jayanagar, jadhavpur, mathurapura, kolkata uttar, kolkata dakshin, barsaat or damdam thim
 Interestingly, in 2014, BJP was third in all these 9 seats and this time it was second on all
 haalanki, uskaa vot share pichhali baar ke mukaable lagbhag doguna bad gaya
 What happened in the seventh phase? Incidentally, violence took place in West Bengal a week before the voting in these 9 seats in the seventh phase
 uttar kolkata main bijepi kaaryakartaaon or trinmul kaaryakartaaon ke bich jhadap hui or college main sthiti ishwarchandra vidyasagar kii murti tod di gai
 This happened when BJP President Amit Shah was rallying in a part of North Kolkata
 raily ke dauraan bhadki hinsa ke baad kareeb ek sadi puraane vidyasagar college main lagi ishwarchandra vidyasagar kii murti ko kuch tatwon ne tod diya
 Although, they have not been identified yet, but after the idol broke, there was a lot of ruckus on this issue
 samaaj sudhaarak or shikshavid vidyasagar bhadra bengali samskruti shaikshit ateet kaa hissaa hai
 Whoever broke the idol, but because of this people were angry about this incident
 vidyasagar kii mahatta ko dekhte hue donon partiyon ne damege control kii koshish kii or ek duusare par jamkar aarope-pratyarope lagaae
 The Trinamool Congress gave some 'evidence' to the Election Commission that BJP workers were behind the demolition, while PM Modi blamed Trinamool workers for the violence and sabotage
 piem modi ne khud vaada kiya ki jahaan par vidyasagar kii murti todi gai he, vahiin par ve vidyasagar kii murti lagavaayenge
 If the voting pattern is seen, the BJP lost three important seats in the city of Kolkata, because many people did not vote for the party
 mamata banerjee ne kaha, 'yah hamalaa or mere pradesh kaa utpeedan bekaar nahin jayega, isaki sajaa milegi
 i am watching everything
 main ek ek inch kaa badla luungi
 'kolkata North, Kolkata South and Jadhavpur are the urban seats of South Bengal, where the Trinamool Congress has a strong presence
 voting ke aadhaar par dekha jaae to bijepi in teenon siton par ek lakh se zyada voton se haari he
 Only Jadhavpur seat was won by Trinamool by a margin of 3 lakh votes
 in teenon siton par trinmul congress ko 2014 ke mukaable zyada vot mili
 Kolkata South seat gained 1,55,192 votes this time, compared to 1,36,338 votes won in the last election
 isi tarah kolkata uttar seat par trinmul ke sudeep bandopadhyaay ne 1,27, 095 voton se jeet hasil kii, jabaki pichley chunaav main is seat par trinmul ko 96,226 vot se jeet mili thi
 This time the Trinamool won the Jadhavpur seat by a massive 2,95,139 votes, compared to 1,25,203 in 2014
 vidyasagar kii murti tode jane ko bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne turant bhaavnaatmak mudda bana liya or bijepi ko bahari party ke taur par pesh kiya jo bengal kii samvednaaon se parichit nahin he
 Looking at the election results data, it appears that Mamata Banerjee played the Bengali card after Vidyasagar's statue was demolished and voters punished the BJP for not voting

 Taking this demand of many 'sisters' seriously, Fadnavis has given priority to this matter
 iskaa hal nikaalane ke liye vah agle hafte shalini thakare se mulaakaat karenge

" 
 
 " Dholavira was a 'modern urban' settlement in the era of the ancient Harappan civilization, which was considered the largest port city in the Harappan era
 yah lagbhag 5,000 saal pehle basaa tha, or lagbhag 3,450 saal pehle tsunami ne ise tabah kar diya

 Rajiv Nigam, a leading scientist at the National Institute of Oceanography, said, "the unique feature of Dholavira is the presence of a 14-18 meter thick wall, which was probably intended to protect against tsunamis

 The government has taken this decision to give a boost to the local economy
 tej barish or baadh ke chalate rajya kii arthvyavastha bighad gai he or sarkaar ko ummid he ki isse arthvyavastha ko badhaava milegaa
 The decision has been taken after a long meeting with the government, temple committees and Char Dham's Panda society

 ' amit shah ke kendriya grih mantri banane ke baad bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke nae adhyaksh ko lekar charchaa shuru ho gai thi or is par somvaar ko us samay viraam lag gaya jab purv kendriya mantri jagat prakaash nadda ko party kaa kaaryakari adhyaksh banaae jane kaa elaan kar diya gaya
 Describing the decision taken at the BJP Parliamentary Board meeting in Delhi, Defense Minister and senior party leader Rajnath Singh said that Nadda will be the acting president of the BJP
 is bich amit shah party adhyaksh bane rahenge
 After Amit Shah joined Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet, JP Nadda has been given the command of the party
 mana ja rahaa he ki amit shah agle 6 maheene tak party ke rashtriya adhyaksh bane rahenge
 JP Nadda, along with Amit Shah, will take over the affairs of the party as the Executive Chairman
 grih mantralay jaise ahm vibhaag sanbhaalane ke kaaran amit shah kii party par zyada dhyaan dene kii sambhaavna kam hi he
 In such a situation, Nadda will be the main actor of the party, although Amit Shah is still in the position of president and he will be watching every decision
 himachal pradesh jaise raajnneetik lihaaj se kamatar rajya se aane vaale jai prakaash nadda ke liye kaaryakari adhyaksh pad par kaam karnaa behad chunauteepurn rahegaa, agar vah agle 6 maheene ke liye bhi party ke pramukh ke taur par kaam karte hai to bhi unke saamne chunautiyaan kam nahin hongi
 Giant image of Amit Shah Maintaining the position of Amit Shah in his tenure will be a challenge for the next president
 jepi nadda abhi kaaryakari adhyaksh banaae gaye hai, lekin unke saamne party ko sheersh par banaae rakhane ke saath-saath khud ko ek shashakt or damdaar adhyaksh ke rup main pesh karnaa hoga
 Everyone will keep an eye on how successful they are in this cause
 4 rajyon main vidhansabha chunaavbator adhyaksh amit shah ke daur main bijepi ko jis tarah kii banpar kamyaabi mili use banaae rakhana nadda ke liye chunauteepurn he
 Assembly elections are to be held in at least 5 states during his term of executive chairman (next 6-7 months)
 inamen se dilli ko chhod 3 rajya aise hai jahaan par bijepi khud satta main he or use sattavirohi maahaul ke bich chunaav main jeet hasil karne kii chunauti hogi
 These 3 states are Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand
 haryana main oktober main vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal khatm ho rahaa he, to maharashtra main november main
 While the term ends on 5 January in Jharkhand
 nadda ke saamne in teenon rajyon main bijepi kii satta par pakad banaae rakhane kii he
 Apart from this, assembly elections are also to be held in Jammu and Kashmir
 abhi vahaan raashtrapati shashan he or agle kuch maheenon main vahaan par chunaav hona he or party ko badi jeet dilaane kii jimmedaari bhi rahegi
 The Delhi Assembly elections are going to be held in the beginning of next year from Delhi Arvind Kejriwal
 vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal 22 farvari, 2020 ko khatm ho rahaa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party is currently in power in Delhi and won a historic victory in the last assembly elections, which came to power for the second time
 bijepi kii koshish pichhali baar hi satta main lautne kii thi, lekin arvind kejariwal ke netritv main aam aadmi party ne bijepi ke sapane ko tod diya
 However, the performance of the AAP party in the Lok Sabha elections ended last month will be very excited as the BJP has captured all the seven seats of all seven
 haalanki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi aisa hi hua tha, lekin kuch maheene baad jab vidhansabha chunaav aayaa to bijepi ko 70 main se sirf 3 siten mil sakin
 The Aam Aadmi Party won the remaining 67 seats
 is baar bhi saaton siten jitkar bijepi puure josh main he, lekin nae kaaryakari adhyaksh ke saamne yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav jaise halaat 2020 main na bane
 It is also certain that it will not be easy to challenge Kejriwal in the assembly elections and the exercise will have to be started from now
 shivasena ko saath rakhane kii chunautiloksabhaa chunaav se pehle tak baagi tevar banaae rakhane vaali shivasena ne bijepi ke saath chunaav ladane kaa faisla liya or uskaa yah nirnay anya vipakshi dalon ke parinaam dekhne ke baad sahi lagata he, lekin aise main shivasena ke vajood par hi khatra mandaraane lagata he
 The visit of party supremo Uddhav Thackeray to Ayodhya within few days of Narendra Modi taking the post of Prime Minister for the second time shows that Shiv Sena will continue its struggle for its existence
 haalanki yah bhi sahi he ki bijepi is baar bhi apane dam par satta main he, lekin nadda ke saamne endie ko bhi banaae rakhana badi chunauti hogi kyonki bijepi ke baad shivasena hi duusari sabase badi party he
 Like JMU to befriend Maharashtra in Bihar, the challenge of maintaining an alliance with the Janata Dal United (JDU) in power is facing the BJP
 bihar main endie ko loksabhaa chunaav main joardaar jeet mili he
 Now Nitish Kumar's government is facing criticism on many fronts
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jediu ke nitish kumaar ne argedy or congress ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa tha or mahagathbandhan ke tahat jeet hasil kii thi, lekin baad main nitish ne lalu prasad yadav kii argedy ke naata tod liya or bijepi ke saath phir se nai sarkaar bana lee
 Assembly elections are to be held in the state in the next year and a half and here too, there will be a challenge to keep NDA constituents together with Nadda
 dakshin bharat ke liye nai ranneetibijapi ko ummid thi ki is baar loksabhaa chunaav main karnataka ke alaava dakshin bharat ke anya rajyon se uske khate main kuch siten aaengi, lekin tamilnadu, andhra pradesh, telugana or kerala main bijepi kii sthiti kaaphi kharaab rahi
 The BJP did not get a single seat in Tamil Nadu, including Andhra and Kerala
 bijepi ne in rajyon main jeet ke liye edi-chotii kaa jor lagaaya tha, lekin niraashaa haath lagi
 Now a new strategy will have to be made in front of Nadda to win the seat in the south
 badbhole netaaon par lagaam lagane kii jimmedaariamit shah ke grih mantri banane ke baad kaaryakari adhyaksh bane jepi nadda ke paas ek badi chunauti yah bhi rahegi ki vah apane kai badbhole netaaon par kis tarah se lagaam laga pate hai
 Leaders like Giriraj Singh, Sadhvi Pragya and Sakshi Maharaj have often put the party in peril over their statements
 pichley dinon iftaar ko lekar giriraaj kii tippanee ke baad amit shah ne unako fatkaar lagaai or niyantran rakhane kii salaah bhi de daali thi

 dilli main land pooling se judi raajnneeti ko darkinar kar den to real estate ke tamaam visheshgy maanate hai ki land pooling dilli kaa kayakalp kar sakati he
 The main reason behind the increasing unauthorized Delhi is the lack of affordable housing here and land pooling can meet this shortage of Delhi
 dedh lakh acre tak jameen hogi uplabdhdidieke ek anumaan ke mutabik land pooling ke baad dwarka se lekar narela tak kareeb dedh lakh acre tak jameen uplabdh hogi
 If sources are to be believed, work will also start here in the next two to three months, as the DDA had completed all the preparations at its level two years ago
 beete do saalon se land pooling kii filedilli sarkaaraki mej par thi
 However, as soon as 89 villages have been declared as urbanized areas, work on it will be much faster
 aapako bataa den ki kareeb 115 gaanvon ko didie ne pehle hi shahrikrut ghoshit kar diya he
 In this way, the scheme will cover the rural areas of 200 villages, as far as the purchase of flats in this area is concerned, then let me tell you that the private builders present here started offering offer plans two years ago
 shrey lene kii raajnneeti bhi shabaab paramai 2015 main hi shahari vikaas mantralay ne land pooling se judi file puri kar di thi or ise puure desh main jameen adhigrahan ke kshetra main ek krantikari badlaav kii tarah dekha ja rahaa tha, jiske baad jor-jabardastee jameen adhigrahan kii jarurat nahin hogi, balki jameen kaa maalik khud hi iskaa hissaa bananaa chahega
 In the last two years, the file of land pooling was stuck on the table of Arvind Kejriwal
 kisi naa kisi vajah se dilli sarkaar ne ise notiphoi nahin kiya
 It is a matter of fact that after passing the notification, Kejriwal first tried to rob the credit of getting the development done to the farmers by doing a road show
 dilli vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh vijendra gupta kaa kahana he ki dilli kii janata sab jaanati he, kejariwal pehle to kuch karte nahin, bas shrey lene kaa dhol bajaate hai
 Obviously, the politics of land pooling between BJP and Aam Aadmi Party will not be reduced further because land pooling is going to prove to be a game changing plan on a large scale
 chote kisaan / jameen maalik honge ghate menland pooling main kul do shreniyan hai, pehali shrenee main 20 hectare se adhik jameen vaale vyakti yaa samooh honge or duusari shrenee main 2 se 20 hectare jameen vaale
 In the first category, the DDA will own 40 percent of the land and will return 60 percent and in the second category, 48 percent of the land will be returned and the remaining land will be retained by the DDA
 saaf he ki duusari shrenee main aane vaale chote or majhole kisaan yaa phir jameen maalik niyamon main is asamanta kaa shikaar honge
 Some farmers have also given a written complaint to Arvind Kejriwal about this, but the land is not the issue of Delhi government, so they cannot do anything
 baharhaal, mana ja rahaa he ki land pooling ke baad ikatthi hui jameen par jo vikaas kii lahar bahegi usamen kam se kam 25 lakh pariwaron ko ghar mil sakegaa

 upi main lagaataar kanoon vyavastha par sawaal uth rahe hai
 In the latest case, a case has come to the Chief Minister's city of Gorakhpur demanding extortion money of Rs 20 lakh from a well-known doctor
 ye vahi doctor hai, jinke aspataal kaa udghaatan khud siem yogi ne 14 june ko kiya tha
 Famous Surgeon Dr
 S
 of Gorakhpur
 es
 Is associated with Shahi
 doctorshahi kaa kahana he ki beeti 28 or 29 june ko unase phone karke 20 lakh rupee kii rangadari maangi gai he or rangadari nahin dene par goli maarane kii dhamkee di gai he
 At first they continued to take the matter lightly, but after two or three threatening calls, they complained about the matter to the SSP of the district
 police ke sangyaan main maamla aate hi hadakamp much gaya
 Because Dr
 Shahi has good relations with the Chief Minister of the state
 yahaan tak ki siem yogi ne hi pichley maheene doctor shahi ke is aspataal kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 The police have immediately registered a case in this regard and started action
 doctor es
 s
 shahi ke mutabik unhen devaria jail main niruddh kisi kaidi ne phone karke 20 lakh rupee kirangadarimangi or paisa nahin dene par jaan se maarane kii dhamkee bhi di
 After this incident, the police department has deployed two armed soldiers with them while providing security to Dr
 Shahi
 police ab is puure maamle kii chaanbin kar rahi he
 Also, the numbers from which Doctor Shahi was called for extortion are being investigated
 police is bare main zyada jaankaree dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 Another firework has started regarding corruption
 pichley paanch-chah saal main ghotaalon par yah chhathi-saatvin rajnatik kushti he, jo har baar puure tevar-turshi or gola-barood ke saath ladi jaati he or raajnneetijivi jamaat ko apni aasthaaen tar karne kaa mauka detii he
 But the reality is that we have entered into a trick of corruption, hoping for decisive liberation from corruption, a country has been made a spectacle of political leprosy
 bharat bhrashtachar ke sabhi paimaanon par sabase upar he, lekin isse nibatane kii vyavastha karne, sansthaaen or paardarshee dhaancha banane main ham un 175 deshon main sabase peeche hai, jinhone 2003 main sanyukt raashtra kii bhrashtachar rodhi sandhi par dastakhat kiye the
 Beyond us, there are countries like Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bhutan and Vietnam, whose efforts, successes and failures find a place in global discussions on corruption
 choperget ke bahaane ham un andolanon or bechainiyon ko shradhanjali de sakate hai, jinhone 2011 se 2013 ke bich desh ko math diya tha
 It seemed as if the revolution had come against corruption in India
 koi bataa saktaa he ki is behad uthal-puthal bhare daur se niklaa lokapal aaj kahaan he, jiskaa kanoon takneekee taur par janvari, 2014 se lagu he, lekin lokapal mahoday prakat nahin hue
 The news was not meant by any newspaper or TV that in December 2014, the Modi government submitted the Lokpal Act to the Parliamentary Committee of the Law Ministry for reconsideration and amendments
 ek saal baad disambar, 2015 main is samiti ne kendriya satarkta ayog or sibiai ke bhrashtachar rodhi wing ko lokapal ke daayre main laane kii sifarish ke saath apni report sarkaar ko saunp di
 What is the commitment regarding corruption that technically it has been two and a half years since Lokpal became a law, but the Modi government did not say anything on Lokpal
 sanyukt raashtra kii sandhi ke mutabik, bharat ko paanch duusare kanoon bhi banane hai
 They also have a whistleblower bill
 is kanoon ke tahat bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane vaale kii suraksha ke praavdhaan deele karte hue sarkaar apni manshaa ko daagi kara chuki he
 The bill is stuck in the Rajya Sabha
 adaalaton main paardarshita ke liye juditial acountybiliti bill, naagarik sevaaon se jude adhikaron ke liye citigen charter and greevans redresal bill, sarkari sevaaon main bhrashtachar rokane ke liye bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon main sanshodhan kaa vidheyak or videshi adhikariyon va antarrashtriya sanghathanon main rishwatakhori rokane ke vidheyakon ko lekar pichley do saal main sarkaar main kahin koi sakriyata nahin dikhi
 Nobody thinks that through the Lokpal or these five laws, we will be able to stop corruption in the politics and culture of India
 yah to sirf bhrashtachar par roak, jaanch or paardarshita kaa shuruaati dhaancha banane kii koshish he, vah bhi abhi shuru nahin ho saki he
 Since the International Treaty on Corruption in 2003 (in force since 2005), almost every country has developed strategies, institutions, rules, laws and agencies to deal with corruption based on its circumstances, which are constantly being revised and made effective
 pichley kuch varshon main yuandipi or transperency international ne bhrashtachar nirodhak ranneetiyon kaa adhyayan kiya he, jo is jatil jang main haar-jeet, donon kii kahaniyaan saamne laate hai
 Romania, for example, tried to build a successful system by learning from its past mistakes
 indonesia ne apni anti karpshan ranneetiyon ko gavarnence sudhaaron se jodakar global str par saraahna hasil kii he
 Australia chose to make the whole system transparent, by linking transparency to broader governance and judicial reforms, rather than creating a national anti-corruption strategy, while Malaysia linked the strategy of eradicating corruption to the Governance Transformation Program, which developed this developing country by 2020
 Aims to convert to the country
 china to duniya kaa sabase kathor bhrashtachar nirodhak abhiyaan chalaa rahaa he, jisamen 2013 se ab tak do lakh se adhik adhikariyon or communist party ke sadasyon kii jaanch ho chuki he or abhiyojan kii dar 99 fisadi he
 Strategies to prevent corruption rest on four basic grounds
 sabase pehla he, majboot or swatantra monitering agency, doosraa, bhrashtachar kii niyamit or paardarshee napjokh jabaki teesraa pahalu he, jaanch ke liye paryaapt sansaadhan or vistrut takneekee kshamtaayen or chauthaa he, spasht kanoon va bhrashtachar par tej faisle dene vaali sakriy adaalatein
 Look at India
 hamaare paas in chaaron main se kuch bhi nahin he
 The struggle to form a powerful independent agency of India (lokpal) continues till now
 kendriya satarkta ayog ko gathan ke 39 saal baad 2003 main vaidhanik darja mila lekin jaanch kaa adhikaar nahin
 The CBI that investigates is the cage of governments
 bhrashtachar kii napjokh kaa koi tantra kabhi bana hi nahin or adaalatein un kanoonon se las nahin hai, jo jatil bhrashtachar ko baandh saken
 All this was not even expected from the mud-sunny Congress, but it was expected from the Modi government that came to power on the mandate against corruption, that it would intensify the investigation of the old scams and the far-reaching and permanent strategy to tackle India corruption and Institutions will give
 agastavestland ke dalal jaanate hai ki duniya ke vibhinn deshon main faile rishwatakhori ke taar jodate-jodate ek dashak nikal jayega
 Politics also knows that nothing happens in the investigation, because they have not done anything institutionally to deal with corruption

 Nirmal Baba, who claims divine power, may now need grace himself
 kyonki unke khilaaf court ne exiaar darj karne kaa aadesh de diya he
 Baba is accused that he is cheating and cheating with his strange prescriptions
 bhakton ko apane nuskhon se satarangi sapane dikhaane vaale nirmal baba ab pahunch gaye hai kanoon kii jad main
 The CJM court of Lucknow has ordered the police to file an FIR against Nirmal Baba
 adaalat ne ye aadesh do bacchon aditya thakur or tanya thakur kii yachika par di he
 These children had lodged a complaint against Nirmal Baba at Gomti Nagar police station in Lucknow on 10 April
 lakhanu kii rahane vaali 16 saal kii tanya thakur or 13 saal ke aditya thakur kaa aarope he ki nirmal baba apane bhakton ko aise nuskhe bataate hai jinka koi vaigyanik aadhaar nahin he
 Even though Baba's devotees are influenced by these tips, Aditya and Tanya gave a written complaint in the police station that Nirmal Baba straightened his owl by showing fear of religion, showing his false importance and fooling people
 Have been
 is prakaar kii harkaton se andhvishwaas ko baari badhaava mil rahaa he, pragatisheel vichaaron ko peeche dhakela ja rahaa he or puri tarah se thagi kii ja rahi he
 The police registered a complaint in this case, but refused to consider the children as victims of cheating and did not register a case of cheating
 iske khilaaf bacchon ne court kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 It is clear that now after the court's decision to register an FIR against Baba, there is a crisis in the congregation
 desh main monsoon aane main abhi lanbaa vakt he par usase zyada intjaar uske purvanumaan ko lekar he
 Why are you waiting? Whether the monsoon will be better or not, the futures plan of the country's companies rests on it
 bataa den ki indian metarological department (iemdi) 18 april ko aagaamee monsoon ke liye apana pehla anumaan jari karne ja rahaa he
 After all, why finance ministers claim to run the country's economy on good monsoon rains, and in fear of bad monsoon, the Reserve Bank shies away from giving a liberal monetary policy or lowering the interest rate? Monsoon economy is important for the country
 About 40 per cent of the total food production in India is dependent on adequate and timely rains
 vahiin june se sitambar tak kii miyaad vaala dakshin-pashchim monsoon desh ke kul barish kaa 80 fisadi detaa he
 Hence the strong southwest monsoon yields a good kharif crop in the country
 acchhee kharif paidaavaar se gramin kshetron main khatp kshamta or kray kshamta majboot hoti he
 In the end, it revolves around the whole economy, as companies across the country take the important decision to increase and keep their production low by the monsoon assessment on this expectation

 bade vakeelon kii fouj ne chidambaram ko sibiai or idi ke mukademon or jail jane ke janjaal se nikalwane ke liye har sambhav koshish kii
 At the same time, the country's major investigating agencies are also not seen in any case
 chidambaram ke vakeelon ke har daanv ko duusare kanoonee nukton se kaata ja rahaa he
 That is, the game of checkmate by legal pieces on political chess continues
 supreme court main chidambaram ke vakil kapil sibbal chidambaram ko special court kii hiraasat main rakhane kaa purajor virodh kar rahe the
 Now there, they are seen pleading before the Supreme Court that till Monday they should be allowed to remain in CBI custody and they are ready for this
 special court main jab sibiai ne or paanch din kii hiraasat maangi to sibbal or singhvi to maanon bifer hi pade the
 He said, 'my Lord there is no need to be detained now
 hamaare muvakkil se ek hi ek sawaal baar baar puche ja rahe hai
 The CBI wants to take them into custody only with the intention of degrading them
 lekin sawaal ye he ki teen din baad hi aisa kya ho gaya ki sibbal jor de rahe hai ki hujur sibiai kii hiraasat main hi chaar din or rahane diya jaae
 We agree to this as well
 haalanki is apratyaashit daleel or apil par sibiai or idi ke vakil solicytor general tushaar mehta ko khush hona chahie tha

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki teen din pehle chidambaram kii sibiai hiraasat avadhi aage badhaane ke jabardast himachati mehta fouran sibbal or singhvi par rashan pani lekar tut pade the
 Now they say why the Supreme Court should interfere in it
 ye to special court ko tay karnaa chahie ki kise kab tak hiraasat main rakhana he or kab nyaayik hiraasat main bhejnaa he
 So the Supreme Court should not do anything about it
 sutron kaa kahana he ki shuukravaar ko sibiai chidambaram kii hiraasat or badhaane par jor nahin daalegi
 As a result, Chidambaram will have to be sent to Tihar Jail in judicial custody
 5 sitambar ko sibiai supreme court kaa faisla aane ke baad tay karegi ki indrani mukherjee or anya `gavaahon' se chidambaram kaa aamanaa-saamana karaane ke naam par phir hiraasat kii maang kii jaye yaa nahin
 Meanwhile, ed's bets will also depend on the Supreme Court's stand
 kyonki paanch taarikh tak to supreme court ne idi ko roak rakhaa he

 Its first poster has been released

 Senior Supreme Court lawyer Rajiv Dhawan has decided to leave the practice following the rebuke of the Chief Justice
 unhone is sambandh main CJI deepak mishra ko letters likhakar avgat karaayaa he
 In his letter, Dhawan has made serious allegations
 chif justise ko likhe letters main vakil rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki dilli banaam centre sarkaar cese ke dauraan apmaan ke baad maine court practice chhodane kaa faisla liya he
 In fact, on 5 December, there was a hearing on the Ram temple issue in the Supreme Court
 is dauraan vahaan congress netaa or varishthawakil kapil sibbal, rajeev dhawan or dushyant davesahit anek varisht vakil maujuud the
 These lawyers were presenting arguments in a loud voice, requesting to defer hearing of the case till July 2019
 rajeev dhawan ne to walkout tak kii dhamkee de daali thi
 This was followed by a hearing in the Delhi vs
 Central Government case
 is dauraan chif justise se rajeev dhawan kii tikhi bahes hui
 Dhawan says that he was humiliated during the hearing of this case
 jisase khafa hokar unhone supreme court kii practice chhodane kaa nirnay kiya
 What the court said: The court had said that during the trial in the court, the conduct of the lawyers who used to speak up and speak loudly was shameful
 saath hi kaha tha ki ise kisi bhi keemat par bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 The Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Central Government while hearing a petition filed for granting special state status to Jammu and Kashmir
 yah yachika dilli ke ek enjio ne daayar kii he
 Article 370 has been challenged in the petition, which gives special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 apni yachika main enjio ne sawaal kiya he ki jammu-kashmir vidhansabha ne aisa kanoon kyon paas kiya jo desh ke duusare hisse main rahane vaale logon ko rajya main achal sampatti kharidne yaa rojgaar se vanchit rakhti he
 The petition has also questioned the inability of any law against Khilafat in Jammu and Kashmir
 gauratlab he ki desh kii raajnneeti kaa dakshin panthi dhada lambey samay se dhara 370 kaa virodh karata rahaa he
 Voices have also been raised in the BJP at the center, demanding removal of 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki modi sarkaar ne dhara 370 ko lekar apni sthiti spasht nahin kii he, lekin satta main aane ke thik baad sansadeey kaary mantri jitendra singh ne ek bayaan dete hue kaha tha ki sarkaar mudde par baatcheet or bahes ke liye taiyaar he
 On the other hand, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has warned that the state will reconsider the terms of the merger with the Indian Union if the debate on Article 370 is raised again
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bijepi ne apane chunavi ghoshnaa patr main kaha tha ki vah jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 hataane ke paksh main he, lekin koi nirnay karne se pehle sabhi sambandhit muddon par batichit kii jaaegi
 During a rally in Jammu in December last year, Narendra Modi suggested that there should be an inquiry into whether the people of the state have benefited or suffered from Section 370
 australia main apni gaadi se ek hi parivaar ke teen vyaktiyon ko ek durghatana main maar daalane tathaa teen ko gambhir rup se ghayal karne ke jurm main ek bhartiya taxi chaalak ko kam se kam saat saal kii sajaa sunai gai he
 Local media reported that in 2009, 25-year-old Indian driver Gurvinder Singh near Metren lost control of his car in an attempt to overtake a truck, causing his taxi to hit another car coming from the opposite direction
 is durghatana main basil tex reh uski patni robin or uski bahan sujen kii maut ho gayi thi
 In this accident, 12-year-old Abe Reh lost his parents and himself was badly injured
 ebe kii 76 varshiya daadi bhi is haadase main jakhmi ho gayi thi
 Apart from this, Amandeep Singh, who was traveling in Singh's taxi, was also injured in the accident
 county adaalat ke nyaayadhish reshelle laviton ne kaha ki singh chaatr vija par yahaan aayaa he or uski sajaa khatm ho jane ke baad use uske desh bhej diya jayega
 The court has convicted Singh for recklessly driving and killing three people and injuring three people severely
 singh ko saadhe das saal kii sajaa sunai gai he or kam se kam saat saal tak bina kisi parole ke use jail main rahanaa padegaa
 He says he was upset after the accident and apologized in writing to Reh's family
 madhya pradesh ke varisht congress netaa or nauveen baar chhindwara ke saansad kamalnath ne kaha he ki empi main agar jyotiraditya sindhiya ko siem phase ke rup main aage kiya jaataa he to vah iskaa swaagat karenge
 Kamal Nath said that it is necessary that the party should announce the CM candidate in the state soon, because elections are to be held there only in December
 siem kii daavedaari se khud ko baahar nahin samajhateiconomic times ko die ek intervyuu main kamalnath ne kaha ki vah khud ke siem kii res main rahane se inkaar nahin karte, lekin vah iske liye bhukhe nahin hai
 Kamal Nath said, 'I really have no objection to Jyotiraditya becoming CM candidate
 yadi aisa hota he to main iskaa swaagat karuunga
 On whether he is going out of the claim of the Chief Minister's post, Kamal Nath said, "I am not exiting myself, but i am not hungry for it
" jisaki bhi ghoshnaa hogi, main uskaa saath duungaa
 Farmers' condition worsens, said Kamal Nath, that the state of agriculture is poor in Madhya Pradesh, while 75 percent of the people in the state are directly and indirectly engaged in farming
 vahaan kii arthvyavastha kheti par nirbhar he
 Yields may increase, but the real question is how much value is reaching the hands of the farmer
 bhavantar yojana se bhi kisaanon ko prati quintal 250 se 300 rupee kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 No farmer is happy with this
 fasal beemaa kii yojana to anarthakaari he
 No farmer got the benefit of insurance, while the insurance companies have made a profit

 On the condition of the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath said that there is a perception that internal arrogance is going on among the leaders of the state
 mujhe lagata he ki yah dharna media ne banaai he
 i do not think our leaders lack unity in any way

 isse kaaryakartaaon main ekajutata ai he
 People have come in support
 unhone jabardast kaam kiya he
 On whether or not Digvijay Singh will be CM candidate, Kamal Nath said, 'I cannot tell anything about this, only Rahul Gandhi can answer this
 'modi kaa muqabla kar paaenge rahul?kamalnath ne kaha ki 2019 ke aam chunaav main rahul gandhi congress ke cheharaa honge, bijepi unke bare main kitna bhi dushprachaar kyon na kare
 Kamal Nath said, 'we should not forget how much Sonia Gandhi was maligned in 2004
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha tha ki vah sir muda lengi, kisi ne kaha ki vah raajnneeti chhod degaa
 There were popular leaders like Vajpayee in front of Sonia ji, but after all they put Vajpayee ji home
 yahi bhartiya matadaata he, bijepi ko yah baat nahin bhulani chahie
 i think Rahul Gandhi will be very effective and strong face of Congress in 2019 election
 'unhone kaha ki bijepi ne 2014 ke chunaav se pehle jo vaade kiye the, un par haal ke maheenon main uskaa puri tarah se bhandaphod ho gaya he
 There is a lot of restlessness among the people
 ab bijepi ko samarthan dene vaala utsaah khatm he
 This time the voter has become very smart
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ko baahar karne ke liye 2019 main rahul ke netritv main ek acha gathbandhan taiyaar ho saktaa he
 This can be pre-election or post-election
 shivesna ke varisht netaa manohar joshi ne daawa he kiya ki ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar maharashtra main pichley vidhansabha chunaav main unki party (shivasena) ke saath gathbandhan karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye the
 Former Lok Sabha Speaker Joshi told PTI, Pawar had expressed his desire to tie up with Shiv Sena in the 2009 assembly elections
 yah puche jane par ki gathbandhan ke bare main pahal kisne kii thi, joshi ne bataaya ki philhal vah ise yaad nahin kar paa rahe hai
 i was asked by Uddhavji (the current president of Shiv Sena) to talk with Pawar and i did
 purv mukhyamantri ne bataaya, baad main pavaar peeche hat gaye
 i do not know why this happened
 joshi ke daawey par ensipi pravaktaa nawab malik ne bataaya, shivasena main joshi ke liye jagah nahin he
 The party refused to give him Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha tickets
 malik ne kaha, vah is tarah kii bebuniyaad baaten kar party main apane liye jagah banane kii khatir prayasarat hai
 Prior to Joshi's revelations, senior Shiv sena-bjp leaders Uddhav Thackeray and Gopinath Munde had said that Pawar wanted to join the NDA
 munde ne kaha tha, agar kisi ko kisi baat kaa intjaar he, to vah khud pavaar hai or vah endie main shaamil hone ke liye intjaar kar rahe hai
 The BJP leader's statement added to the controversy, triggered by Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray's claim that Pawar could not join the NDA due to his opposition
 munde ne kaha tha ki pavaar ne endie netaaon se sampark kiya tha
 i spoke to Uddhav and then to other coalition partners in Maharashtra
 or ham sabane tay kiya ki ham sharad pavaar tathaa unki ensipi ko endie main shaamil nahin hone denge
 Demonetisation and black money are two such burning issues on which the politics in Bihar has intensified

 kuch yahi hua bihar ke purv mukhyamantri va argedy supremeo lalu prasad kii patni rabari devi ke saath
 Former Chief Minister Rabri Devi not only used profane language against BJP leaders in the assembly premises, but she also spared Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 aapattijanak bayaan dene ke maamle main mashhoor bihar kii purv mukhyamantri rabari devi vidhansabha parisar main patrakaron ke sawaal kaa jawaab de rahi thi
 While speaking, she said that BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi, take Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to his house and get his sister married
 rabari devi ke is bayaan ke aate hi bihar kii raajnneeti achaanak garm ho gai or is bayaan par na keval bijepi, balki jediu ne bhi aapatti darj kii he
 In fact, former Chief Minister Rabri Devi was demanding an apology from BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi in the Legislative Council and was not allowing the House to function
 rabari devi kaa kahana he ki jab tak susheel kumaar modi sadan main maafee nahin maangenge, wo sadan ko chalane nahin dengi
 Rabri said that in the last 25 years, the CBI had raided from his house to the house of his relatives in search of black money
 phir susheel kumaar modi ne lalu prasad ke bare main yah kyon kaha ki unke paas kalaadhan he
 Rabri Devi said that Lalu Prasad has always been against black money and is still against it
 bihar kii purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ne kaha ki vah kalaadhan ke khilaaf hai na ki notebandi ke khilaaf
 Rabri said that Nitish Kumar is also not supporting black money, but he is also supporting demonetisation
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main rabari devi ne kaha ki mahagathbandhan atoot he or media vaale kitni bhi koshish kar kyon na kar len, mahagathbandhan tuutane vaala nahin he, bihar main sarkaar paanch saal chalegi
 When former Chief Minister Rabri Devi was asked that BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi is saying that Nitish Kumar should come back to BJP, Rabri Devi was agitated and said that Sushil Modi, take Nitish Kumar to his house and marry his sister Please get it done
 halaki baad main rabari devi ne kaha ki unhone ye baaten majaak main kahi thi

 People are being provoked by deliberately creating misunderstandings about the law
 jo koi bhi bhartiya naagarik hai, kisi bhi dharm, jati yaa ling ke hon- hamane is tarah ke bhedbhaav kaa kabhi samarthan nahin kiya or na hi kabhi karenge

 Election campaign for the fourth phase has come to an end and polling for 53 seats will be held on February 23
 gauratlab he ki uttarapradesh kii 403 siton main se 209 siton par matdaan hone ke baad bhaajapa ko mil rahe feedback ne bhaajapa kii chintaa ko badhaa diya he
 Sources reveal that the three-phase feed back sent by the Sangh to the BJP is also not encouraging

 sangh ne meerut, braj, kanpur, avadh or kaashi ke kshetra prachaarkon ko bhaajapa ke paksh main swayamsevakon ko sakriy karne ke nirdesh die hai
 The BJP assesses that if the Sangh shows its activeness in the remaining seats and uses its ground power in favor of the BJP, then bjp's victory can be ensured
 sangh ne apni basti, mohalla, nagar str se lekar praant or kshetra ke padaadhikariyon ko bhaajapa ke paksh main maahaul banane kaa nirdesh diya he
 However, how much this ground work of the Sangh is for the BJP will be known only on the coming March 11

 " In the afternoon that day, the corridors of the Supreme Court were buzzing with lively discussions
 adaalat ke kamaron main kai haathon main 11 november kii ek khabar kaa printout gum rahaa tha jisamen kanoon kii ek yuva chaatra ne daawa kiya tha ki uske saath ek ‘pratishthit, haal main ritair naanaa-dada kii umr ke ek jaj’ ne chhedkhani kii he
 The name of the seven judges who retired from the year 2012 to 2013 was written on the hand behind it
 yah chhedkhani karne vaala koun ho saktaa he? har koi yah anumaan lagane kii koshish kar rahaa tha

 He had said, "we cannot take it lightly
 is sanstha kaa pramukh hone ke naate main chintit hum or yah jaanane ke liye utsuk hum ki ye aarope sachche hai yaa nahin
 "in view of such an unprecedented situation, he set up a committee of judges on 13 November to look into the matter, including Justice R

 Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly, 66, was like a 'shining star of the judiciary' for many fellow judges and lawyers

 anya kai nirnyon main ve adaalat main maanavadhikaron, khaskar mahilaon ke adhikaron kii mukhar aawaaj bane the
 It is now a sad irony that Justice Ganguly finds himself in an embarrassing line of powerful people who allegedly misused office and power to play with the identities of a woman
 un par us chaatra se chhedkhani kaa aarope he jo 24 disambar, 2012 ko unke paas internship karne ke liye gai thi
 This was the same period when Delhi was boiling against gang rape

 She wrote a post titled 'through My Looking Glass' in the journal Journal of Indian Law and Society of her educational institute National University of Judicial Sciences, recalling the shock of that winter night
 vah likhti he, “dilli main un dinon police ke bairicade ko chakma dete hue or kaaphi thak-haar kar haal main ritair hone vaale supreme court ke ek jaj kaa sahyog karne pahunchi thi jinke under main aakhri se pehle vaale semester main kaam kar rahi thi
 The result of my hard work came in the form of sexual assault, not physical harm, but it was abusive, on behalf of someone who was my grandfather's age
 ” vah likhti he, “main iske bare main bhayaavah vivaran nahin dena chaahati, lekin itnaa hi kahana paryaapt hoga ki us kamare se baahar nikalne ke kaaphi samay baad tak main use bhula nahin pai
 a week later, in an interview to a portal, the intern said that she was surprised to hear that "three other cases of sexual harassment have been reported by the same judge and i know at least four other girls who are others" There have been victims of harassment by judges
 ”uske is daawey kii kuch der baad hi fasebuk par ek or intern ne pushti bhi kar di
 She wrote, "the funny thing is that i have probably gone to the same person where SJ went
 mere saath kai baar anapekshit yon vyavhaar kiya gaya jaisaa ki uske saath hua he
 "she wrote," We did stupid things and ignored her touch because we respected her and it was totally different from what we knew about her, her views about feminism, patriarchy and social justice

 Dattu and Ranjana testified before the committee of Prakash Desai and elaborate on what had happened to him that night: Justice Ganguly offered him a glass of wine after taking some drinks and then coming close to him despite protests Started trying samiti ne justise sadashivam ko 29 november ko apni report de di, or iske lagbhag tatkaal baad hi ganguli se pashchim bengal maanavadhikaar ayog se istipha dene kii maang uthne lagi
 Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Bandopadhyay said that Ganguly should immediately resign as the chairman of the State Human Rights Commission and the Delhi Police should file an FIR
 ”ganguli ne supreme court kii cameti kii report aane ke baad kaha ki unhone report dekhi nahin he or ve is par tippanee karnaa nahin chaahate
 In several interviews, he has claimed that he has been unhappy with these allegations and described himself as a 'casualty of circumstances'
 unhone supreme court samiti ko die apane bayaan main bhi esaje ke aaropon se inkaar kiya he
 He has also received support from several big names in the legal fraternity, including former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee and former Chief Justice of India Altamas Kabir
 kabir ne ek pramukh rashtriya akhbaar se kaha, “aarope to hameshaa lagaae jaaenge
 The more people rise in their life, the more conspiracies are against them
 aarope to kahin bhi, kisi bhi vyakti ke bare main lagaae ja sakate hai
 Sorabji said that Ganguly's resignation from the West Bengal Human Rights Commission would set a 'dangerous precedent'
 is tarah kaa samarthan kuch had tak is vajah se he kyonki ganguli kaa kariyar behad chamakdaar rahaa tha jiske dauraan unhone ek pragatisheel jaj or ‘maanavadhikaron ke rakshak’ ke rup main pratishtha hasil kii
 He was appointed as a permanent judge in the Calcutta High Court in the year 1994 and after being in the Patna High Court for some time, he became the Chief Justice of the Odisha High Court in the year 2007 and the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court in 2008
 disambar, 2008 main ve supreme court chale gaye
 The lawyers who know him describe him as a decent and gentle man who had a tendency to progress
 chennai main unhone do aitihaasik aadesh die theah mailaa dhone par pratibandh or tamilnadu main kanoonee shiksha main sudhaar kaa prabandh
 His best innings was in the Supreme Court where he, along with Justice Singhvi, delivered a landmark judgment in the 2G case
 supreme court ke ek varisht vakil ne kaha, “2ji maamla pehali baar ek saadhaaran piiel ke rup main aayaa tha jiske bare main har kisi ko lagata tha ki vah khaarij ho jayega
 But after enough discussion, the judges accepted it and at the next hearing, Justice Ganguly asked that Telecom Minister A
 raja apane pad par kaise bane rah sakate hai
 This remark by Ganguly signaled the beginning of the end of a minister and this led to a debate on corruption across the country
 inhen vakil ne aage kaha, “vidambnaa hi he ki ab yah sawaal uthaae jane lage hai ki justise ganguli ko apane pad par bane rahanaa chahie yaa nahin
 "P
 bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne raashtrapati ko patr likhakar ganguli ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii maang kii he
 In the Supreme Court, Justice Ganguly reinforced his image as the leader of human rights
 unke saath do jajon vaali khandpeeth ne 1976 main khud supreme court ke nirnay kii aalochana kii thi jiske dwaara apatkaal main jivan ke adhikaar jaise mul adhikaron par roak laga di gai thi
 After this, he gave several historical decisions continuously, many of which are contrary to his work which he has been accused of
 varsh 2009 main jab justise markandeya katju ne kaarysthal par yon utpeeda ke bare main 1997 kii vishakha guideline kii vaidhata par sawaal uthaae, to justise ganguli ne ek alag nirnay likhakar court ke is adhikaar kaa samarthan kiya ki nyaay ke hit main kanoon main kisi bhi khami ko dur karne ke liye vah aadesh jari kar saktaa he
 In the year 2010, he started a debate about whether the society has failed to give proper rights to the woman while living and even after her death
 unhone yah paaya ki jab kisi property main mahila kii hissedari yaa uski durghatana main maut par muaavje kii gananaa kii jaati he to ek gruhinee ke rup main uske yogadan ko nazarandaaj kiya jaataa he
 After retiring, Ganguly continued to work in the West Bengal Human Rights Commission
 chhedchhad ke badhate maamalon ko dekhte hue april, 2012 main ayog ne aise aparaadhon ke liye kathor sajaa kii sifarish kii
 In August the same year, the commission criticized the state government for arresting a professor who broadcast a blasphemous cartoon of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 ayog ne kaha, “yadi aisa hi jari rahaa to ham ek ekadhikaaravaadi shashan kii ore bad jaaenge
 The Commission cannot remain a mute spectator about such unethical situation
 ” isliye tajjub kii baat nahin he ki justise ganguli par lage aaropon se enujees kolkata ke shikshak or chaatr stabdh rah gaye hai
 After retiring, he is a member of the executive committee of this institution and is also a guest lecturer
 uniwarsity ke ek karmchaaree ne kaha, “khaskar duusari ladki se hamen jo vivaran mila he, usase isamen andeh nahin lagata ki unhone yah sab kiya he
 He is the lighthouse of the world of law and everyone here respects him, but everyone has something lacking
 ”uniwarsity ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki chaatr-chaatraon ko ganguli ke saath internship anaupchaarik taur par di jaati thi
 Another employee said, "they were working on a book and they asked the dean to provide some interns to help them
" ’ ab kai chaatr or karmchaaree unke khilaaf karrwai karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 a senior professor, who did not wish to be named, said, "it is beyond belief that when the Supreme Court has initiated an inquiry against its retired judge, no such action has been taken by the university
" ”court ne aaropon kii jaanch ke liye furti se kadam uthaaya he, lekin shaayad vah koi karrwai karne kii sthiti main na ho
 Senior lawyers say the judges' committee was just for a formal inquiry
 yah teen main se ek cheez tay kar sakati he-koi maamla nahin banataa, yah anuchit vyavhaar kaa maamla he, lekin yon duvryavhaar kaa nahin, yah yon duvryavhaar he jisaki police main shikaayat kii jaani chahie
 The committee investigating the allegations of sexual abuse has admitted that the woman's allegations are true
 lekin saath hi court ne is bare main koi karrwai karne main asamarthta jataai he
 According to the committee, "sj's written and oral statement seems prima facie that retired Judge A
 ke
 Ganguly was indecent (verbally indecent and of sexual nature)
 ” mukhya nyaayadhish sadashivam kii ore se jari report main kaha gaya he, “yah dekhte hue ki ukt mahila supreme court main panjikrut intern nahin thi or sambandhit jaj bhi ghatana vaale din tak pad par nahin the, is nyaayalay kii ore se koi or kadam uthaane kii jarurat nahin he
 The Chief Justice said that in the media report he was introduced as a judge of the Supreme Court and hence the committee was formed
 5 disambar, 2013 kii adaalat kii baithak main hue faisle ke anusaar is nyaayalay ke purv nyaayadhishon ke viruddh maamalon par supreme court prashasan kii ore se koi karrwai nahin ho sakati
 The Criminal Law (amendment) Act 2013, the most stringent law against sexual harassment passed in April this year, cannot be enforced from the back date
 varisht vakil raju ramchandran kehete hai, “cameti ko yadi yah pataa chalata he ki anuchit vyavhaar hua he to uski report kaa gambhir naitik nihitarth hoga
 This will make it difficult for Justice Ganguly to continue in his current position
 ”nyaayadhishon ke apni hi birdari ke varisht sadsy ke khilaaf die gaye faisle kaa vibhinn halkon main swaagat kiya gaya
 Kavita Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association (AIPWA), says, "for the first time such a case came up and the court acted on it, it is welcome
 ” lekin iske saath hi justise ganguli par apane maujuuda pad ko chhodie kaa dabaav bhi bad gaya
 Sooner or later they will be forced to obey the rules which they had articulated while delivering the verdict
 is tarah ab me lord khud funs gaye hai
