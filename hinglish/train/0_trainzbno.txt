 Even though the Central Government has framed new rules to reduce the risk of mobile tower radiation, the danger of danger in Delhi is more because about 50 percent of the towers are illegally installed here
 chintaa kii baat ye he ki inako lagane kii na to parmishan he or na hi inhen lagaate vakt guideline kaa paalan kiya gaya he
 After the implementation of the new rules for mobile towers, it has become clear that these are danger towers
 bhale hi tower se nikalne vaale electromagnetic radiation se hone vaale nuksaan kii pushti na hui ho, lekin sarkaar ne nae niyam banaakar maan liya he ki radiation khatarnaak he
 But the danger is even greater in Delhi, because about half of the mobile towers in the capital have been installed illegally
 north emsidi ke standing cameti ke adhyaksh yogendra chandoliya ne bataaya, 'hamaare record ke mutabik dilli main aadhe tower gaiyrkanoonee hai, kyonki tower lagane se pehle jo zaruri bate hai, jinhen dekhakar emsidi parmishan detii he, wo nahin lee gai
 If we have taken action, these people have gone to court, now we cannot take action, but half the towers are set up illegally
 emsidi kii report ke mutabik dilli main kul 5656 mobile tower hai, inamen se mobile companiyon ne keval 3000 mobile toweron ke liye kanoonee tareeke se emsidi kii anumati hasil kii he
 There are still 2656 mobile towers, which have been installed keeping the necessary guidelines and the MCD has not allowed this
 philhal ye maamla dilli hoicourt main he
 But in the midst of the efforts to reduce radiation, illegal mobile towers in Delhi have once again raised the possibility of danger
 mobital tower se nikalne vaale radiation se khatre kii ashanka hameshaa bani rahati he
 Also, the randomly placed mobile towers have increased this risk manifold
 ab radiation kam karne ke nae niyam to bana die gaye hai, lekin sawaal in niyamon ke sakhti se paalan kaa he
 Mobile towers in Delhi are not only close to schools and hospitals, but are also very near houses in residential areas, this will not only keep the fear of danger, but the new rules will also prove ineffective
 is baat se to kamobesh sabhi sahamat honge ki daftar main yadi aapaki dosti aapke bos se ho gai to afvaahon kii bhatthi hameshaa garm hi rahegi
 Maybe there will be a healthy relationship between you and the boss, but people will not stop whispering
 aise main ham aapako suzav dete hai ki kis prakaar aap sab-kuch apane paksh main lekar chal sakate hai
 
 
 What will people think? This is the problem of our society and offices are no exception
 agar aapkaa bos aapkaa best friend he to sabhi ke paas apana najariya hoga, or kahin vah vipareet lingi hua to phir log aapke peeche na jane kya-kya baaten karenge
 Nothing will remain secret
 
 
 aisa kai baar hota he ki hamaare munh se bos ke saamne wo sari baaten nikal aati hai jinhen saarvajanik taur par na bolnaa hi acha hota he
 In such a situation, you should be alert and avoid such things at all, which will put you in further trouble
 yah nijee nahin bijness kaa maamla he
 
 
 It may be that your friend personally does not scold you for everything, but professionally you will need to be very cautious
 aakhir ant main to sara maamla aarthiki par hi aakar simat jaataa he na?apana akalan khud karen
 
 
 If your boss is coming in between your work and its result, then you need to be very cautious about your work
 aisa na ho ki sara kaam or relation aapas main mil jaae
 On the question of the weekend
 
 
 aisa aksar hota he ki jab aapkaa dost hi aapkaa bos hota he to weekend par bhi nae chehre dekhne ko nahin milte
 There are more disadvantages than being together on other days of the week and being with them on weekends as well
 agar aapkaa dost hi aapkaa bos ho jaae
 
 
 This happens many times with a colleague working with us who is also our friend
 ek din tarakkee paakar hamaara bos ban jaataa he
 In such a situation, a little clarity has to be brought about in one's own pace and relationships

 amejan ne email ke riplai main yah bhi likhaa ki is maamle main wo unki koi madad nahin kar sakate
 'will take legal action' It is significant that even before this, e-commerce companies have done fooling people by sending RIN detergents or stones in the package, but they took responsibility for it and returned the customer money
 par amejan ne unhen paise lautaane se saaf inkaar kar diya he
 Uttam says that he will fight for it and will punish those who have cheated on him

 com / x8txic4pil — AMRITA KATIYAL (@nimratofficial) January 27, 2016 Released on January 22, the film 'airlift' is based on the evacuation of Indians from Kuwait during the iraq-kuwait War of 1990–91
 yah film 1990 kii vaastavik ghatana par aadhaarit he jisamen akshay ne ek kuwaiti bijnesaman ranjit kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa
 Ranjit Katyal, a businessman, searched for the evacuation of 1,70,000 Indians trapped in Kuwait and rescued Indians from Iraqi attacks and traveled several kilometers to Amman, where the largest exodus of human history took place
 narmada bachaao andolan kaaryakarta medha patkar ko ek kshetreey passport karyaalay mumbai ne ek kaaran bataao notice jari kar poocha he unke khilaaf chal rahe maamalon ko chhipaane kii vajah se kyon naa unka passport jabt kar liya jaae, lekin medha ko lagata he ki is notice ke peeche ek gahari saazish he
 Talking to NDTV in Bhopal, he said that i think it is a very deep conspiracy which needs to be explored
 pehle se hi kuch kaarobaari samoohon ke saath, kuch sarkaar ke numaayinde hamaare kilaaf hai ye aaj desh main aam rup se ho rahaa he ki jan andolankariyon ko badnaam karo, unhen jail main daalo
 This has been planned to divert attention from the right issues
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah pehle hi 18 oktober, 2019 ko mumbai aarpeo ke notice kaa jawaab de chuki hai, unhone apana likhit jawaab saajha kiya he jisamen unhone bataaya ki wo pehle hi madhyapradesh ke badvani, alirajpur or khandwa jilon main jo maamle dikhaae gaye hai unamem se teen (badvani main do or alirajpur main ek) main bari ho chuki hai
 Another case related to taking out a silent procession for the oustees of Sardar Sarovar was registered in Barwani in August 2017, so there was no question about notifying it to the Passport Office in March 2017
 jahaan tak khandwa jila nyaayalay main lambit maamalon kaa sawaal he, mujhe yaad nahin he ki inamen se kisi bhi maamle main saman yaa giraftaar kiya gaya he or na hi yaad he ki in maamalon main abtak aaropee banaaya gaya he
 Under the leadership of Medha Patkar, he sat on the satyagraha for the sixth day outside the Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA) office in Bhopal for the better rehabilitation and other demands of Sardar Sarovar in Bhopal
 aam aadmi party (aap) ke baagi vidhayak karnal devendra singh saharaavat or anil vaajapeyi ke bijepi main shaamil hone ko lekar ek baar phir dilli vidhansabha ke spikar ram nivas goyal ne notice bheja he
 Speaker Ram Niwas Goel has asked both rebel mlas of Aam Aadmi Party to file their reply by 3 July and to appear on 4 July
 darasal, dilli vidhansabha ke spikar ram nivas goyal ne dal badal kanoon ke tahat donon baagi vidhayakon ko notice bheja he, kyonki donon hi vidhayak ab bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 Earlier, rebel MLA from Bijwasan Colonel Devendra Singh Sehrawat had approached the Supreme Court against the first notice, which caused a setback in the Supreme Court and the court refused to intervene
 gandhinagar se aap ke baagi vidhayak anil vajpai ne kaha ki ye to aam aadmi party or spikar ram nivas goyal ko sabit karnaa he ki main bijepi main shaamil hua hi yaa nahin
 Because according to the change of party law, first the party president sent me a notice which was not sent on behalf of the party
 anil vaajapeyi ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal 2017 tak aap ke adhyaksh the, uske baad unka kaarykaal badhaayaa hi nahin gaya, jabaki mujhe jo notice mila wo aap ke pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne bheja he joki maanya nahin he or dal badal kanoon ke tahat party adhyaksh notice bhejtaa he naa ki pravaktaa
 Second, i am also facing a case of office profit
 tab us paristhiti main main vidhayak hum yaa nahin court faisla legaa kyonki court main maamla chal rahaa he
 He said that the third one i joined the BJP or not, is to prove technically to the Aam Aadmi Party and the speaker, while under the rule, nothing like this has happened yet
 unhone kaha ki dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne bhi pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee ke saath manch saajha kiya tha to kya kejariwal ne trinmul congress jwine kii hui he
 Sachin Tendulkar, VVS, as a member of the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) due to a conflict of interest dispute over accepting the Mentor position of the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise
 lakshmana mangalvaar ko bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ke lokapal di
 K
 jain ke saamne pesh hue
 Many people feel that it is not known that Sachin, Laxman and Saurabh Ganguly will not be available to be part of any committee of the board after the new constitution of the board comes into existence
 iskaa matlab he ki in teenon khilaadiyon kii sevaayen puri tarah se nahin lee gayi kyonki in teenon ko sirf bhartiya team kaa mukhya coach chunane ke liye hi niyukt kiya gaya
 All three of them were appointed coaches of the Indian team in 2016 and 2017 by the CAC
 yahaan tak kii prashaskon kii samiti (sioe) ne mahila team ke mukhya coach ko niyakt karne ko lekar in teenon ko zyada samay bhi nahin diya tha
 Talking to IANS, a senior BCCI official told how the board shifted the services of three Indian cricket giants
 adhikari ne kaha, 'yah behad dukh kii baat he
 In the current situation, the three were forced to go before the Lokpal where the COA could tell the Lokpal that all three were 'clearly' involved in the issue of conflict of interest
 sioe ne bhartiya cricket ke in teen diggajon kii sevaaon ko puri tarah se upyog bhi nahin kiya
 The official said, "according to the new constitution, these three cannot be part of any committee after five years and this rule will exclude them after 2020
 kya board main jo tantra peshewar tareeke se kaam kar rahaa he use pataa he ki unhen kya khoyaa he? unhone in teenon ko mahila team kaa coach niyukt karne ke liye paryaapt samay bhi nahin diya
 Seeing less is a big disease
 'ek or adhikari ne kaha ki yah jo 'saaf taur par' hiton ke takaraav kaa mudda he vah sioe ke taraf se gairajaruri he
 The officer said, 'he is not in a position to say that
 sachin kaa udhaaharan le lijie kya unhen mumbai indiens yaa siesi main rahane ke liye bisisiai kii taraf se koi paisa mil rahaa he? to phir hiton ke takaraav kaa mudda kahaan he? saath hi 2020 ke baad se aap unhen kisi bhi cricket samiti main shaamil nahin kar sakate
 a veteran who played cricket for the country for 24 years and 25 seasons will never be eligible to be a selector
 'bisisiai ke nae samvidhan ke mutabik, jo shaks paanch saal tak kisi cricket samiti kaa hissaa rahaa hoga vah bhavishya main koi or samiti kaa hissaa nahin ban paaegaa
 According to this rule, the CAC which was appointed in 2015 has only one year time
 iske baad sachin, ganguli or lakshmana kisi bhi cricket samiti kaa hissaa nahin ban paaenge
 Another bad thing is that when the Tigers were selected as members of the CAC in 2015, the objective of bringing these former players was to improve the performance of the national team and also to make India the best team in the world
 Roadmap to be prepared, but in the past year, this committee has officially done only two things - in 2016 Anil Kumble was appointed as the coach of the national team
 In 2017, Ravi Shastri was appointed the coach of the team when his tenure ended
 dukh kii baat yah he ki khel ko lambey samay tak sevaayen dene vaale in diggajon ko ab yah sabit karnaa pad rahaa he ki yah hiton ke takaraav ke maamle main nahin hai

 The much-awaited meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has ended on Thursday
 baithak ke thik baad nitish ne kaha ki unhone piem ke saamne vishesh rajya samet apni tamaam maangon ko rakhaa, jabaki piem ne kaha ki vah unki maangon par gaur karenge
 After this meeting in South Block, Nitish Kumar said that he raised the issue of loss to Bihar with the recommendation of Finance Commission in front of the PM and talked about meeting the deficit
 nitish ne kaha, 'vitt ayog kii siforeeshon se bihar ko kuch laabh nahin mila
 The advantage of being a backward state also ended with the closure of BRGF
 usase bhi hamen nuksaan hua

 The CM of Bihar said that our demand is that the funds should be given to the states under the centrally run schemes
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki wo hamaari maangon par gaur karenge
 a plan of Rs 1 lakh 20 thousand crore for five years has been approved
 nitish ne kaha, 'hamane pradhanmantri ke saamne ek baat spasht kar di he ki nai yojanaon ke tahat bihar ko madad kii jarurat he
 We want the Center to help us after the separation of Jharkhand and the Center also understands this very well
 'vaajapeyi ko bharat ratna kaa swaagatanitish kumaar ne is maukey par modi sarkaar kii ore se purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bharat ratna die jane ke faisle kaa swaagat kiya
 Nitish said, 'it is a good thing to honor him
 ham iskaa swaagat karte hai
 On the other hand, on the issue of Janata Parivar, Nitish said that he will also meet Mulayam Singh Yadav on Thursday
 janata parivaar main shaamil hone kaa maamla atka nahin he, lekin is ore abhi aage kadam badhaayaa janaa baaki he
 Significantly, on the cleanliness of the Ganga, PM Modi has called a meeting of the Chief Ministers, just before which the CM of Bihar has attended the Modi court
 yah mulaakaat is myne main bhi mahatvapurn he ki donon netaa vaicharik str par ek-duusare dhur-virdohi maane jate hai
 The distance between Nitish and Modi was also the reason behind jdu's stance as a constituent of NDA

 6 may ko karan obaroy ko is maamle main arest kiya gaya tha or unhen police castady main bhej diya gaya tha
 Karan Oberoi's lawyer Tiwari said that the FIR was completely wrong and his client, Karan, had never talked about marrying him

 After this, Karan's family had approached the Mumbai High Court for Bell and today he has got bail

 We expect the police to conduct a fair investigation into the matter

 During an interview, Tara said, "what really attracted me to 'marjawan' was the character Zoya, who cannot speak

 This helped me a lot for the film

 For the first time, the pairing of Siddharth and Tara is working
 haalanki isse pehle siddharth or ritesh film ek villen main saath kaam kar chuke hai
 Ritesh played a negative role in the film, which people liked very much
 khaas baat yah he ki isamen ritesh boune kaa role kar rahe hai
 He has never played such a character before
 yah film 22 november ko cinemagharon main relies hone ke liye taiyaar he
 The film is directed by Milap Zaveri
 isse pehle vah jon abraham kii film satyamev jayate kaa nirdesan kar chuke hai jo pichley saal relies hui thi
 Manoj Vajpayee was seen in the film besides him
 supreme court ne pulavama or uri hamale kii jaanch kii nigaraanee karne or patharbaajon ke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaane kii janhit yachika ko thukraa diya he
 These cases were sought to be investigated under court supervision
 is yachika main haal hi main jammu kashmir ke pulavama or 2016 main uri main hue hamale main kathith prashasnic vifaltaa kii nyaayik jaanch kii maang kii gai thi
 Apart from this, strict legal measures were demanded on those who attacked the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir in any way
 yah yachika edwocket vineet dhanda ne di thi
 According to the Asian Age, in this petition it was said that if any Indian citizen has helped the terrorists based in Pakistan, then action should be directed against them
 saath hi unhone court se apil kii thi ki 'anti-neshnal gatividhiyon main sakriy taur par shaamil' ol parties hurriyat conference (APHC) ke netaaon ke khilaaf uthaae gaye kadamon kii bhi jaankaree lee jaae
 Apart from this, it also appealed to the government to withdraw the security of Hurriyat leaders and ban the operation of their bank accounts
 bataa den ki 14 farvari ko pulavama main siarpief ke kafile par hue aatanki hamale main 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 The attack was carried out by a suicide bomber
 is hamale kii jimmedaari jaish-e-mohammad ne lee thi
 Kargil war was also mentioned in the petition
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki 1999 ke kargil yuddh ke baad jammu-kashmir main suraksha balon ke liye sthiti or kharaab ho gai he
 Since 1999, 4000 soldiers have lost their lives across the country
 iske saath hi yah bhi kaha gaya he ki rajya main aatankwaad or raajnneeti samarthit aatankwaad apane charam par he or yuvaaon ko bahaka kar apane hi suraksha balon par hamale ke liye uksaaya ja rahaa he
 The petition said, "the religious leaders and politicians of Jammu and Kashmir are engaged in the task of destabilizing the state and confusing the youth
 ve yuvaaon ko swatantra jammu-kashmir kaa nakli sapana dikhaa rahe hai
 Political organizations such as APHC are playing a very negative role in destabilizing the state by actively collaborating with Pakistan-backed organizations
 ' saath hi kaha gaya tha ki centre sarkaar in gatividhiyon ko mook darshak bane hue dekh rahi he or rajya main aatankwaad ko badhaane waalon ke khilaaf koi ection nahin le rahi he

 Apart from laptops and tablets to the youth, announcements of giving blankets and saris to the poor elderly are missing from the priority agenda of the Chief Minister in the new year
 rajya sarkaar ne vidhansabha chunaav-2012 main intermediat paas yuvaaon ko laptop va hiskool paas vidhyaarthiyon ko tablet dene kaa elaan kiya tha
 The government claimed to give laptops to about 1
5 million intermediate passes in a single session in a two-year term, but has not been able to give tablets to high school pass students even once
 varsh 2013-14 ke agenda main madhyamik shiksha vibhaag ke vikaas sutara main laptop va tablet dene ko kanya vidya dhan yojana ke upar sthaan diya gaya tha
 But this time, Kanya Vidya Dhan is on the department's agenda but there is no laptop and tablet
 itnaa hi nahin pradesh sarkaar ne 65 varsh se upar ke garib bujurgon ko ek-ek kambal or 18 varsh yaa isse upar kii mahilaon ko saal main do-do sari dene kii baat bhi kahi thi
 Despite the provision of Rs 800 crore, the government has not been able to start distributing saris and blankets in these two years
 varsh 2014-15 main sarkaar kii praathamiktaaon kaa jo vikaas agenda tay kiya gaya he usamen is yojana kaa bhi zikr nahin he

 jaraa sochie agar kisi ko pataa ho ki agle kuch pal main jindagi or maut main se kisi ek ko hi bachanaa he to us pal main usapar kya beetegi? afghanistan ke jalalabad main ek aatankwaadi seene par bam baandh kar khud ko udaate hue afgaan sena ke ek camp ko udaane aayaa tha, lekin isse pehle ki wo aisa kar paata afgaan sena ne is daboch liya
 By then, the Afghan army itself did not know that the gunpowder was tied on its chest, but as soon as the army came to know after the capture, everyone lost consciousness
 tab tak kisi ko pataa nahin tha ki seene par bandhaa bam kaise fatega? timer se yaa remote se?har gujarata lamhaa jaanaleva tha, lihaaza afgaan sena ne apni jaan jokhim main daal kar ek faisla kiya
 It was decided that this human bomb should be put in a car and taken away from the city to a deserted place, so that even if the bomb explodes, the damage is not much
 isi ke baad aatankwaadi ke donon haath peeche kii taraf baandhe gaye or saath main donon pair bhi, taaki kisi bhi keemat par wo dhamaakaa naa kar sake
 After this, this suicide bomber is brought to the middle of a field, miles away from Jalalabad
 uske seene par bandhe bam ko bam dyspojal skhwid ke ek jabanj afasar ne anjaam diya
 Before the operation starts, it is decided that the terrorist should not do any such activity that detonates the bomb
 lihaaja afgaan sena use bandook ke nishane par leti he or chaaron taraf fail jaati he
 The terrorist asks for water before the operation begins
 wo guzarish karata he ki uske haath khol die jaaen taaki wo pani pi sake
 Even after this, an army soldier shows courage, he goes close to him with a bottle of water and feeds him water with his hands
 pani pilaane ke baad salwar kurta pahane aatankwaadi ko sena jameen par let jane kaa hukum detii he, saath hi use chetavanee di jaati he ki agar usne jaraa bhi apane jism ko harakat dene kii koshish kii, haath-paanv jhatka to use goli maar di jaaegi
 The belt is then opened, which somehow contained the bomb
 iske baad belt kholane par pataa chalata he ki usamen itane barood the jo fatate to saikadon log maare jate
 Along with the bomb, the terrorist also hung grenades on the chest
 bam ke alaava usne jism main eke-47 rifl or bahut si goliyaan bhi chupa rakhi thim
 As soon as the bomb was separated from the body, now the danger was gone
 iske baad us bam ko bekaar kar diya jaataa he, baad main sena pakade gayi aatankwaadi ko jail bhej detii he or is tarah live bam ko bekaar karne kaa ye sabase khatarnaak oparation apane anjaam ko pahunchataa he

 jivan ke dushwaar safar main, bemausam barasaatein sach,usne kaise kaati hongi, lambii-lambii raaten sachjane kyon meri neendon ke haath nahin pile hotepalakon se hi laut gai hai sapanom kii baaraaten sachmere liye is baatcheet kii adarsh shuruyaat hogi, agar aap vidisha ke us alok se shuru karen, jo gazalon ke alok main pravesh karne ke liye taiyaar hone kii prakriya main tha? us parvarish main ek shaayar, geetkaar yaa patrkaar ke janm lene kii gunjaaish kitni thi?vidisha kaa zikr ruh ko mahakaa detaa he
 The age in 1980-82 would have been 10–12 years
 garmiyon kii chhuttiyon vaali tapati dopaharen, ham jaise chote shaharon ke ladke amuman khel-kud kar guzaaraa karte hai, lekin main or meraa ek dost, ghar kaa chota cameraa band karte
 Putting coolers, Jagjit used to throw a cassette of Chitra ji's ghazals in a tapricorder and listened till evening, chanting till night
 sach kahuun to zahano-dil kii kachi mitti main ghazal ke naksh yaheen se bane
 The atmosphere of the house and Vidisha was particularly literary
 to yahi shauq baad main paravaan chadhate-chadhate gazalen kehane kaa fitoor ban gaya
 Babuji would be angry, 'have gone on to become poets and poets
 pehle pard-likh kar naukari se lago to zindagi bane
 'I would have given my mother an answer to this fret -' You will see that i will grow up to say ghazals and one day my ghazals will sing Jagjit Singh ji
 maa muskuraakar kahatee- 'amin
 The same word that came out as a blessing later became the title of my first ghazal collection - Amen
 baad main vidisha main hi samakaleen kavita ke mahatvapurn naam narendra jain ji or kavi mitra braj shrivastav, rabindra swapnil prajapati, alok putul, ashutosh dube or pawan karan in sabake saath uthanaa-baithna hone laga
 What is happening in contemporary poetry and literary landscape
 uski dasha-disha kya he
 This kept updating evenly
 yani mere gazalkaar kaa puraa shaishavkaal, nai kavita ke maahaul main beetaa
 Bhopal was nearby
 daud kar bharat bhawan chale janaa
 Listening to poetry of a great poet or poet, watching a stage staged
 kitaaben khoj laana
 Then Vidisha's own literary atmosphere
 vahiin, ramakrishna prakaashan main sampadak kaa kaary, padhane-likhane kii naukari
 All this had a profound effect on the unconscious
 mere banate-gadhate rachanaakaar ko chupchaap taiyaar kiya
 i think this is a big factor in what happened to the ghazalkar sitting within me, which developed my thinking even more
 aapke ghazal sangrah amin ne to shoharatein batori wo to jag-jaahir hai lekin aapkaa ek kahani sangrah- afarin bhi prakashit hua, kahaniyaan likhane kaa man kab or kaise bana?meri kahaniyaan darasl meri gazalon kaa hi vistaar hai
 You will see that the images which have come in many stories, you will feel the reflection of my ghazals
 ghazal kii apni paridhi he
 Is the limit
 jab, kahin laga ki yahaan baat vistaar chaahati he
 If this thing cannot be said in Ghazal, then i turned to the stories
 koi suniyojit yojana nahin thi kahaniyaan likhane ke peeche
 That is why there is no serious claim as a story-writer
 javaani ke alok se bhi rubaru karwaaie
 a mischievous smile is attached here
 ek rachanaakaar kii javaani uski rachanaaon kii taazgi or sarokaaron main nihit hoti he
 As long as there is freshness in his creativity, newness and new concerns, he is young
 isiilie main sadaa rachanaatmat or sakaaratmak rahata hum
 And i am always busy doing something new
 kisi mitra ne kabhi kaha tha - 'kaam kiijie or karte rahiye
 Nothing better than this ' maine is mantra main joda he ki - haa usase sakaaratmak or kuch bhi nahin
 That is why i am active and positive all the time
 jawan rahata hum
 Anyone can get angry with your Urdu words, writing and Talfuz
 urdu kii talim hasil kii yaa likh-padhakar hi siikhaa?dow
 Bashir is the lion of Badr saheb - He is not trained anywhere in the world
 Two books are read in the house
 For me every piece of my training is opened in the house itself
 maa-babuji ko urdu kaa shauq or sahitya kii gahari samaj thi
 Elder brother Anand Sahar used to say songs
 mujhase bade bhai arun jinka haal main nidhan ho gaya, kisi hausale kii tarah saath rahete the
 There were frequent meetings, debates and literary meetings at home
 to bas, khaad-pani miltaa rahaa or dhire-dhire paudha darakht banataa rahaa
 You are a journalist, but also a poet, would this combination have a significant impact on your personal life? What would you like to call yourself, a humble journalist reading Mushaira around the world or a humble poet working in a channel? Humility is your most visible quality, in both cases you could not dare to remove this word
 darasal donon kii kirdaaron ke liye jo ek chiz sabase zaruri he wo he - samvednaa
 Journalist is also sensitive like a poet
 uske paas bhi, kavi kii tarah samvednaa ke saath-saath paini drushti hoti he
 That is why i could never see these two characters separately
 shaayad tabhi, ghar yaa baahar ke jivan main asahajata ab tak nahin hui
 Yes, if you talk worldly, there is definitely a difference
 tivi kii zamin kuraduri or duniya tej-tarraar he jabaki kavi kii zamin narm or duniya jhil-se tehraav kii tarah
 If the matter of journalism has gone, then tell how this journey from Vidisha's Ramakrishna publication to Bhopal and then from Bhopal to Delhi became possible
 vidisha ke ramakrishna prakaashan main rahete hue lekhan kii koob swatantraaa thi
 The time and atmosphere was there
 to us samay desh kii kai patr-patrikaon main swatantra lekhan koob kiya
 Wrote regularly for India Today, Outlook and Dainik Bhaskar in particular
 bhaskar main ek-do kollam bhi shuru ho gaye
 When the columns were discussed, Bhaskar called from Bhopal
 kal tak jo kaam freelansar ke taur par karata tha, vahi mukammal naukari main tabdeel ho gaya
 The credit of bringing Delhi's TV journalism from print journalism of Bhopal goes to senior journalist Hemant Sharma Ji (india TV)
 ek dilachasp yaad he
 i am sharing with you that Rajat Sharma ji had interviewed me and then after the interview Hemant ji had ordered me to listen to his ghazals for a long time
 vishesh rup se ammaa-babuji
 Spent nearly two years in India TV
 aisa kehete hai ki aapke pichley karm, aapke bhavishya kii dishaaen tay karte hai, lihaaza vidisha main rahete hue india today ke liye jo sakriyata dikhaai uske paritosh swaroop, tivi today network se bulaava aa gaya
 So worked for about eight years in Aaj Tak
 ab, july 2014 se doordarshan kaa neshnal channel adwiser hum
 This is very creative work
 hameshaa kuch na kuch creative karte rahane kaa shauq he is liye is kaam se bhi bahut kush hum
 You read 'chintan-darshan jeevan-surgeon rooh-nazar Par Chai Amma' at some places by doing 'sunny if it is an anchal'
 aisi zarurat kyon padi?iskaa shrey swa
 Jagjit goes to Singh
 jab apane ek elbum ke liye ve ye ghazal record kar rahe the tab unhone gane ke etbaar se ye badlaav karavaaya tha
 Since then, he has climbed everyone's tongue
 ye unke last album kii tital ghazal he jise aap jald hi sun sakenge
 You write, when you come to me, you get wet so much, i get so much love that the eyes get wet, there is also a natural sweetness in the tone of your reading
 kuch aisi ki koi aapke ashaar doharayega to apane swabhaav se kuch adhik vinamr hokar doharayega
 Perhaps this will be the quality of your personality which will come easily in the ghazals? Or do you make an honest effort to remain sweet as an extra effort while writing? i just write while writing
 zyaada sochataa nahin hum
 Because thinking is the work of the brain
 or dil ke kaamkaaj main dimaag kaa kaarobaar jodate hi sara lekhan kaarobaari ho jaataa he
 That is why the one who comes to the heart easily gets on the paper and the same comes out of the tongue
 is baatcheet main aapako ek dis-adwantage ye ki main aapako nijee taur par bhi jaanata hum
 So i know that you own a comfortable and healthy sense of humor
 par aapse milane se pehle tak mere liye yah andaja lagaana mushkil tha
 What else is there that you are sitting locked in seven boxes? You, a creator, live in many layers
 vaqt or halaat tay karte hai ki wo apni kis parat se kaise riect karegaa
 After 'amen' and 'afreen' are you ready to write? har dam
 Every watch
 wo kis saanche main dhalega ye soche bina
 There is also a question about your creation process
 irshaad kamil kehete hai ki vah train shaayar banakar likhte hai or phir do-teen din baad ustad shaayar banakar apane sher ko ri-evaluat karte hai
 Many poets think only in images
 aapkaa bhi ek thinking process to hoga hi?main ricreat bahut karata hum
 i keep innovating my own writing
 main aisa maanata hum ki jab kuch creat na ho to ricriet karnaa chahie
 The urge for creation remains with him
 thinking process main bahut hadabadi nahin karata
 Let me come to what comes naturally
 aapako kya lagata he logon ne aapako kis tarah ke shaayar ke rup main sweekaara he? sahitya ke kuch johnor to prachlit hai hi
 There is rebellion in some shayari, political comment in some and beauty dominates in some
 alok shrivastav ke mutabik, unki shaayari main kya-kya he?rishte
 i respect every relationship related to me very much
 is darkate daur main unhen bachaae or banaae rakhane kii har mumkin koshish karata hum
 It was nice when many responsible and adorable people started saying 'poet of relationships'
 mere bheetar insaani rishton ke prati alag se jo anuraag he, wo rekhaankit hua, khushi hui
 i respect those who respect the relationships around them
 isiilie meri kavita main yahi tatv sabase zyaada aata he
 In addition to the masterpieces like 'amma' and 'babuji', you also wrote that it is often the reason for distance
 But the seriousness and understanding in your ghazals must have had some history
 Your readers will love if you share some of your life, who gave you such understanding? Mother was almost 25 years old when she died
 main apane jivan main shuruyaat se hi unke saath rahaa
 What would you say is new? Every child lives? But no, my mother was working
 prashasnic seva main thim isiilie wo gharelu maanon kii tarah nahin thim
 His life, philosophy, contemplation, perspective, understanding and everything was completely different from others
 maine apane aasapaas kii duniya unheen kii nazar or samvednaa se dekhi
 They have a deep influence on me
 main aksar kahata hum ki mere bheetar meri maa rahati hai
 So nothing can go wrong from here
 har purush ke bheetar thodi-thodi sree rahani chahie
 Because moisture is very important for the doors to remain green
 sabase yaadgaar mushayara koun sa rahaa?mushaayare to ab bhi mayaari hi hote hai
 If you leave one or two superficial mushairs, 'tilak and caps' have not been able to penetrate all the mushairs of our country and the world so far
 isliye mere or mujh jaise har shaayar ke liye, lagbhag har mushayara, yaadgaar mushayara hi rahata he
 But in the year 2012, there was a smile in doha-qatar, i remember him as one of my most successful and memorable Mushaira, in the honor of Wasim Barelvi Sahab's Sadrat and Mansoor Usmani Sahab
 saal 2007 main laal qile ke kavi-sammelan main apni kamyaabi bhi, shaayad hi kabhi bhul paaun jiske baad dilli main ek nai pahchaan mili thi
 Those humans who provide the banyan shade of Alok Srivastava's poet and human? My own
 dost-ahabaab
 Relationship-house
 koi ek kahaan he jiskaa zikr karun ? sabaki duaen shaamil hai yahaan tak aane main
 You also wrote that you were scolded in Mir Khwab yesterday, there is nothing in the name of Shayari, but the new generation is accused that they are unaware of the poetry of Shayari
 isamen yah sawaal bhi jod len ki shaayari ke naam par satahi chizon ko popular hone kaa spes kaise mil jaataa he? kya yah maan lene kaa vaqt aa gaya he ki logon ne acchhee shaayari samajhnaa band kar diya he?haa ye sher tanz he kavita ke us daur par jisamen sirf kavita hi nahin ho rahi, kavita ke naam par baaqi sab kuch ho rahaa he
 But i do not believe that a good poem is finished
 main desh or duniya ke aise anginat manchon par jaataa hum jahaan sirf kavita hi suni jaati he
 Latifi-poems and superficial-jumalas do not even get the land to put there
 duusari baat, meraa bharosa he ki aap kinake saath khadey hai, isse kahin zyaada ahm yah he ki aap kis bhoomika main khadey hai
 Be neutral in your role, if you are doing well
 stareey kar rahe hai to ek na ek din usko sweekruti zarur milegi
 You are also a respected lyricist
 aapke mutabik hindi sahityakar acha likhane ke baavjood filmi duniya main jagah kyon nahin bana pate
 For this, what changes should they make in themselves
 kya isaki ek vajah yah bhi he ki hindi sahitya main kuch khaae-pie aghaae logon ne marketing ko 'ek galat chiz' ke rup main prachaarit kiya he, isliye nae log apni marketing karne se darate hai?film, ek bilkul alag johnor he
 They are very demanding
 hamaari hindi kaa sahityakar yaa kavi man-rachia hota he
 He creates what comes in his mind and then he lives his own creation for a long and long time
 demanding likhane kaa kaam or kamaal, use zyaada lubhaa nahin paata, shaayad isiilie vahaan uski patari nahin baith paati
 In contrast to the Urdu poets, you will see a long tradition that wrote successful songs in films and was well received in adab
 aap kah sakate hai ki - is muaamle main, shaayad urdu vaale hindi waalon se zyaada flexible hai
 You call Namwar Singh Babuji
 unase apane rishte par kuch kahen?sahitya se itar bhi kuch sambandh hote hai
 As such, you should consider it as a father-son relationship
 bahut laad, pyaar or ashish mila he unka
 That is why this address comes out of him
 mapra sahitya academy kaa dushyant kumaar sammaan, rus main antarrashtriya pushkin sammaan or uske baad ab america main hindi ghazal ke liye antarrashtriya hindi sammaan paanaa, kaisaa anubhav rahaa
 How are the honors for a creator encouraging? Leave it up, talk about the challenge
 mujhe har sammaan ek chunauti kii tarah lagata he
 The logo that comes from it brings a strange voice that is probably heard only to the person who has received it, "who has been awarded for what he did
" ab is kasuti par khare utarana tumhaari zimmedaari he
 So every respect seems a new responsibility, a new challenge to me
 aakiri sawaal, adab ke alok ko jagajeet singh, shubha mudgal, pankaj udhaas se lekar amitabh bachchan tak ne ga diya he to kya ab filmon or elbams kii duniya main jane kaa mukammal iraadaa kar liya he ? yaa yah sakriyata yaheen tak he or kya nayaa hone vaala he, bataaenge
 There are already many friends in films
 dilli main apana kaam karte hue agar wo kuch aisa likhvaayenge jo mere mood or mizaaj ko suut karegaa to zarur likhuunga, likh bhi rahaa hum
 Currently, i am doing a solo album with Jaswinder Singh, the son of the famous music composer Kuldeep Singh Ji and Ghazal's new star- 'amen'

 I'm liking it
 padhie alok shrivastav ke 10 chuninda sherye sochna galat he ke' tum par nazar nahin,masroof ham bahut hai magar bekabar nahin
 Now even my own blood has clearly said, i will be yours but not my life
 zaraa paane kii chahat main bahut kuch chhot jaataa he,nadi kaa saath detaa hum, samandar ruuth jaataa he
 It is a reward for the people of the city to rob you, we are often robbed in the village

 i have seen a lot of fluttering relationships in the house millions of times, when Amma secretly sneaks up
 babuji guzare aapas main sab chizein taqasim huin, tab-main ghar main sabase chota tha, mere hisse ai ammaa
 Now there is a blanket on that listened forehead, Amma ji has all the decorations, all the jewels were babuji
 kabhi bada sa haath karch the kabhi hatheli kii sujan,mere man kaa aadha saahas, aadha dar the babuji
 i know my mother's prayers go together, bharat ne rasinic evam jaivik hathiyaaron par aatankwaadiyon or 'non-state factors' ke haathon main padane ke khatre ke prati duniya ko aagaah karte hue iske liye satark rahane kaa aahvaan kiya he

 Sanjay Raut said that such a strong government has come for the first time which is taking such a step
 talaak dene ke kaaphi ajeeb kaaran hote hai
 Ever divorced if there is no salt in the vegetable, such things are heard
 is dauraan sanjay raut ne kaha ki islamic scollar tarek fateh ek baat kehete hai ki hamen allaah kaa kanoon chahie, mullaon kaa kanoon nahin chahie

 centre sarkaar or bijepi ne bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya
 But the Mufti is still firm on his statement
 khaas baat yah he ki is masale par unhen apni saansad beti mahabuuba kaa bhi saath mil gaya he
 The mufti said on Monday, 'I did not say anything wrong and needlessly making sesame palm
 ' anantnag se saansad or unki beti mahabuuba mufti kaa bhi kahana he ki unke pita ne kuch galat nahin kaha
 After the swearing in on Sunday, the Mufti credited Hurriyat, terrorist organizations and people across the border with creating a better atmosphere for the assembly elections
 unhone kaha tha, ‘main on record kahana chahta hum or maine pradhanmantri se kaha he ki rajya main vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye hamen hurriyat or aatankwaadi sanghathanon ko shrey dena chahie

 Rajnath and the leaders of his party keep clarifying anything, but the mufti has remained steadfast on his statement and clarified what his strategy is going to be

 Our share of tax in our country's GDP is just 16 percent, it is our goal to increase it

 People used to do paper, pen first now they will do it online

 During this time also the time of entry pre-view

 There are double check options everywhere
 unhone kaha ki rajyon ko ghaataa hone par bharpai ke liye muaavja milegaa isliye ve saport kar rahe hai

 Everyone will benefit from it
 vipaksh ke virodh par boleen sitaraman- ham unhen chiyarliders banane ke liye nahin kah rahe, ham chaahate hai ki ve hissaa len

 There has been constant talk on the rate
 main chaahati hum ki sector viz sector baat ho
 We talked to the sector wise industry
 texital sector kii samasyaon ko inhen meeting main khatm kiya gaya
 Talked about it till the implementation of GST
 20 lakh se kam ke kaarobaar par hamane chhot pehle hi de rakhi he
 We are also giving compensation more than that
 vimens hygin product par, tex kaa virodh hua
 But they are creating self help groups, they can take advantage of this
 samasya tab he jab aap register nahin kar rahe hai
 Because those who are coming to buy from you will not be able to register you, then your business will be affected
 mantri ne kaha ki sab rate or sab chhot ham chaahate hai ki aam logon tak pahunche
 We know that before GST, the discount we give does not reach the end customer
 yah ek prakaar kaa ulanghan he
 This is a serious question as to why the benefit of tax exemption is not reaching the last person
 unhone kaha ki war room jo banaae gaye hai wo logon ko jile level tak madad kar rahe hai
 Whatever customers, businesses are calling
 hamen soshal media, mail par sawaal puch rahe hai

 This will eliminate 17 taxes, plus it will be beneficial in ending corruption
 gadakari ne kaha ki petrol-sharaab ko jiesti main laane se rajya sarkaar ne manaa kiya
 GST will increase revenue of state government and central government
 abhi logon ko 28 fisadi tex zyada lag rahaa he, lekin log ye nahin dekh rahe hai ki isse kaaphi tex bhi khatm ho rahe hai
 He said that earlier people had to face many difficulties in filling every kind of tax
 abhi logon ko shuruaati kuch samay main ise dekhnaa chahie, agar koi dikkat hogi to usamen sudhaar laayaa jayega
 The increase in tax on the pack product will not affect the lower middle class
 gadakari ne kaha ki desh ke liye videshi nivesh jaruri he, lekin desh ke vyapaariyon ko bhi badhaava dena jaruri he
 Opposing us is the compulsion of Congress, so it is doing so
 jiesti sirf bijepi kii dein nahin, congress ne bhi is par kaam kiya he
 But as opposition, they have the right to protest
 sansad main aadhi raat ko special satr par vipaksh ke virodh par unhone kaha ki ye bijepi kaa kaarykram nahin he, ye sarkaar kaa kaarykram he
 It will include many celebrities of the country including PM, President, former PM
 abhi jo bhi slab taiyaar kiye gaye hai, wo sirf hamaari sarkaar kaa faisla nahin he
 All of them have decided together
 sarkaar jiesti ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar he, ham lagaataar is par baat kar rahe hai
 The government has implemented this by taking everyone along, if there is any problem
 to ham use dur karenge
 Gadkari said that US President Donald Trump has also praised it a lot
 unhone kaha ki jiesti main jaldbaaji nahin kii gai he, isko lekar kaaphi lambey samay se bahes chal rahi he
 Gadkari said that with the introduction of GST, Inspector Raj will end, people will get exemption from 17 taxes and 22 cess
 nitin gadakari ne kaha ki main bhi piem modi kii tarah hum, ham log media ke dabaav main kaam nahin karte hai
 i want to appeal to the traders that once they should allow the system to be implemented, we too may have some fault
 agar dikkat hoti he to ham sudhaar karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Our government saved Rs 50,000 crore from the grant
 kai jagahon par kathor nirnay karne kaaphi jaruri hai
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Finance Minister (anchor - Rahul Kanwal) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that in the last 70 years no bill has been debated as much as GST
 unhone kaha ki jiesti lagu hona bada mauka, bade kadamon se hi desh kii takadir badalati he
 Jaitley said that many leaders played an important role in implementing this
 kai rajyon ke mantriyon ne ise paas karne main kaaphi madad kii
 We had several meetings for everyone's consent, many meetings lasted for 2-3 days
 arun jetali ne kaha ki sab kuch centre ne tay nahin kiya he, ise 31 rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ne saath main har faisla kiya he
 We have recordings of all council meetings
 hamane har vishay par sarvasammati se faisla liya
 So i have told all the opposition parties that you have supported this everywhere, should have joined the celebration
 unhone kaha ki isamen ham bas apana hi prachaar nahin kar rahe hai
 We have been taking everyone along since the beginning, we have also invited former Prime Ministers
 jetali bole ki aage bhi kai aise maukey aaenge jab congress party ko kaaphi kuch sochna padegaa
 Arun Jaitley said that the private sector in the whole world is ahead of the government, but this time history has changed
 ham kaaphi samay se kah rahe the ki 1 july ko lagu karenge, or ham is taarikh ko lagu kar rahe hai
 We had fixed the prices of all things till 18 June, the decision of 1 July was not just my decision but it was decided by the GST Council
 vittamantri ne kaha ki kuch nayaa karne par shuru main dikkatein aati hai, par use sudhaar kar liya jaataa he
 He said that this country has many characteristics
 jab notebandi lagu hua to logon ne kaha ki jidipi gir jaaegi, lekin kuch nahin hua
 There was a problem in the first few days after demonetisation, the countries where GST has failed was a different situation
 hamaare desh main un deshon se alag vyavastha he
 Those who criticize should understand, for the last 70 years, our governments have been running governments by borrowing
 unhone kaha ki agar har koi tex dena shuru kar de to udhaar kii naubat nahin aegi
 To run the country, it is very important to improve the tax system
 jetali ne kaha ki ham log 130 karod hai, 5 lakh se zyada inakam vaale is desh main 71 lakh log hai, unamem se 61 lakh selary vaale hai
 In the rest, not all people pay tax
 agar indrect tex kii baat karen, to hamaare desh main sirf 80 lakh log hi tex dete hai
 We hope that the number of tax payers will increase further
 arun jetali bole ki log ek nai vyavastha main aa rahe hai, isliye ghabrahat he
 On the problems of traders, Jaitley said that all these returns will be filled with software, they will not have any problem with this
 unhone kaha ki desh main vyapaariyon kaa ek bahut bada varg he jo iskaa swaagat kar rahaa he
 Jaitley said that in any system, he will be spoiled, but action will be taken against him as well
 GSTN ke network par unhone kaha ki 15 sitambar ke baad puraani vyavastha puri tarah se khatm ho jaaegi
 Every state government will have to impose a single vote on GST, if you are a participant in every decision, then it is necessary to uphold it
 jammu-kashmir main dhara 370 kii vajah se deree hui he
 The government there will have to enact its own law separately
 jab main vitt mantri bana tha, to neshnal conference ke netaa ek cameti ke chairman the
 And today they are opposing it
 kashmir ke vittamantri ne har baithak main hamaara saath diya he, ummid he ki vahaan par bhi jaldi paas ho jayega
 Jaitley said that if there is a loss to any state government after GST, then it will be repaid for 5 years, if it does not apply in Jammu and Kashmir then the people there will be very difficult
 vahaan kii sarkaar ko is bare main sochna chahie
 The Finance Minister said that every state government of Congress has opposed to keeping petrol and liquor in GST
 petroleum padaarth abhi jiesti main hai, lekin council ke faisle ke baad hi use lagu kiya jayega
 At the same time the same has happened on real estate, i agreed to Manish Sisodia's proposal but many others said that GST is implemented first and then it can be implemented
 unhone kaha ki sharaab ke mudde par rajya sarkaar taiyaar nahin he
 Arun Jaitley said that airplanes and cars cannot be taxed the same, so different tax slabs have been brought
 jetali bole ki jiesti ke bare main kollam likhane or use lagu karne main kaaphi antar he, jinpar ham 6 % tex le rahe hai unhen 12% ke slab main nahin rakh sakate hai
 Therefore a slab of 5% is formed
 unhone kaha ki agar ham ek hi tex slab laate to mahangaai kaaphi had tak bad jaati isliye alag-alag tex slab banaae gaye hai
 We have tried to reduce prices
 jiesti ke lagu hone se builder kai galat tareeke se tex lene kii koshish kar rahe hai, isse logon ko bachanaa hoga
 On the issue of China and India, Jaitley said that Bhutan has given a statement that the land belongs to Bhutan, we have a relationship with them to protect them, so we are there
 china ke 1962 kii yaad dilaane par jetali ne kaha ki 1962 ke halaat alag the, or aaj ke halaat alag hai
 We have to understand this
 congress ke sansad ke vishesh satr kaa virodh karne par jetali ne ise gaiyr-jimmedaarana bataaya
 He said that if there was a day program, we would come to the program, if there is a program at night, then it would not come
 jetali ne kaha ki main ise abhi tak ke sudhaaron main kaaphi aage rakhuunga, ham 1991 ke sudhaaron ko bhi kaaphi bada kah sakate hai
 Manish Sisodia, Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Government (anchor - Shweta Singh) Manish Sisodia said that this idea of the Central Government is very good, but there is no way to implement it
 hamane jiro pratishat tex kii baat kii thi, lekin kai tarah ke tex lagaae gaye hai
 Who will be able to pay 28% tax on tea biscuits
 unhone kaha ki ye pehali baar he ki kapadon par bhi tex lagegaa
 This GST is just the government's income-enhancing tax
 manish ne kaha ki jiesti ke lagu hone se kaaphi mahangaai bad jaaegi
 He said that the central government accepted many of our ideas, they gave good debate in this many ways
 lekin bada faisla nahin le paae, jiesti se kaaphi kuch bighad saktaa he
 Manish Sisodia said that 28% tax is too much for the common man of the country
 unhone kaha ki sharaab or real state ko isse baahar rakhana galat faisla, in donon ko jiesti ke daayre main laana chahie tha
 You are imposing GST on things like cement, but it is wrong not to impose real state
 sisodiya bole ki hamane tex system main dilli main kaaphi acha badlaav kiya he, agar centre sarkaar logon ko vishwaas main leti to kaaphi acha hota
 Manish Sisodia said that i still have more questions about this, and their answers are less
 unhone kaha ki iske lagu hone se centre or rajya sarkaar ko zyada phayda hoga, aam aadmi ko nahin
 He said that bringing GST is not a crime, but it is necessary to benefit the public but it is not visible
 abhi bhi logon main isko lekar dar he
 Sisodia said that celebrating it is not right, it should have been implemented without celebration
 unhone kaha ki jisko tex kii samaj he wo samajhegaa ki ab vah waite se hatakar GST ke shikanje main aa gaya he
 He said that there should be such a system that people give tax happily, there should not be such an atmosphere that people start stealing
 hamaari sarkaar ne tex ko ghataya to tex kaa revenyu bad gaya he
 This is not freedom, were we in financial freedom earlier
 agar ye aazaadee he, to ham aazaadee kaa matlab hi nahin jaanate hai
 Manish Sisodia said that no one can say that he is an expert of GST
 GST kaa phayda tab hoga jab log khushi-khushi tex dena shuru karaden
 If traders feel that something is going wrong, they have a right to protest
 unhone kaha ki dilli main madhyam vargeey vyapaariyon ko isse kaaphi dikkat hone vaali he
 Bivek Debroy, Member, NITI Aayog (econ - Rajeev Dubey) Member of NITI Aayog, Bivek Debroy said that India is the first federal country in the world which is implementing GST
 unhone kaha ki vastuon par doirect tex lagane chahie, indrect tex nahin lagane chahie
 Biwake said that this is why many things are out of GST
 ye sirf ek jiesti he agar jis jiesti kaa sapana dekha tha vah lagu hota to isse jidipi ko kaaphi phayda hota
 He said that it will also benefit and there will be losses
 jiesti ke bare main 17 saal se charchaa ho rahi he, iske liye kai baar dedline tay kii gai par ye ab lagu ho rahaa he
 He said that this is the beginning of a good step
 agar ham adarsh GST kaa intjaar karte to shaayad or 17 saal lag jate
 Debroy said that in implementing GST, every party has agreed on one thing, GST Council has also done a lot of work on this
 council ko aage bhi lagaataar baithak kerani hogi, taaki yah sucharu rup se chal sake
 He said that it may also take a very long time to get good GST result
 bivek bole ki isse kuch sector main mahangaai kaa asar dikh saktaa he, lekin aisa nahin he ki kai sabhi sectoron main mahangaai hogi
 Yes, we can definitely say that inflation may increase for some time after GST is implemented
 congress netaa anand sharma (ankar- rajdeep saradesai)congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha ki hamaare virodh ko bahishkaar kahana galat he, hamanen kabhi bhi jiesti ko tamaasha nahin kaha
 Our government had brought it, when only one Chief Minister protested, only Narendra Modi did it
 agar ham bhi aisa hi karte to aaj jiesti lagu hi nahin hota
 Not attending the night is not a political protest
 aazaadee ke vakt aisa hua tha, uske baad duusari baar aazaadee ke 25 saal puure hone par phir baad main 50 saal puure hone par aisa hua tha
 Congress has been involved every time
 abhi to har jagah alag keemat he, lekin jiesti se ek kar ek tex to hoga hi
 Anand Sharma said that it is just a celebration
 congress ne bhi apane kaarykaal main kai aitihaasik kaam kiye hai, lekin kya hamanen kabhi kendriya kaksh main aisa kaarykram kiya he
 The opposition is not sitting for clapping
 piem modi ko bataanaa chahie ki unhone 7 saal tak GST kaa virodh kyon kiya
 He said that GST is being implemented due to the understanding of Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko logon ko samajhaana hoga ki aakhir vah iske aane ke baad kaise kaam karenge
 The government did not run a trial run of the GST network, all our state governments have passed the GST
 unhone kaha ki hamane jiesti ke mudde par sarkaar kaa virodh kiya he
 We are just saying that the central government attitude is irresponsible, the government should not be hasty in this matter
 ham koi virodh nahin kar rahe hai, ham bas suzav de rahe hai
 Anand Sharma said that in today's time, protesting has become treason, Sardar Patel has banned RSS after Gandhi's assassination
 unhone kaha ki modi kii tulana nehru se karnaa bemaani he, nehru angrejon ke khilaaf ladaai main lade or jail gaye
 But the Prime Minister did nothing, their ideologies had come to nothing for granted
 unhone kaha ki hamen is baat kaa koi shrey nahin lenaa he, piem modi ko hi shrey lene dijie
 We are saying that no new customs should be created, such programs should be held only after 25 years, 50 years, 75 years
 unhone kaha ki agar aaj unhen cheenk bhi aa jaati he to wo aitihaasik ho jaataa he
 Everything he does becomes historical
 anand sharma ne kaha ki hamane apni sabhi shankaaon ko sarkaar ke saamne rakhaa tha, sarkaar ko vyapaariyon kii training kerani chahie tha
 He said that it is his decision to support Nitish Kumar, PM Modi and Nitish Kumar have performed each other's arti many times
 ham log anti modi front nahin bana rahe hai, hamaari ladaai bijepi or aresas se he sirf modi se nahin he
 On PM Modi's statement on the guards, why Modi was silent for so many days, it has damaged the image of the country
 piem kaaphi majboot hai, kai logon par aadhi raat main red dalava dete hai, lekin wo gorakshakon ke mudde par kuch nahin kar pate hai
 He said that everything seems to be an event for the Prime Minister, just get photographed in some way
 agar kendriya kaksh ke alaava kahin par kaarykram hota or bulaate to ham jarur jate
 Special talk with Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu: (anchor - Rajdeep Sardesai) Union Minister Vekanya Naidu was the first speaker at the event in the GST Special Conclave till date
 naidu bole ki jiesti ek desh ek kar ke sapane ko puraa karegaa
 Naidu said that the Congress was protesting meaningfully on this issue

 People who live in Mumbai and use autos to go to office or for everyday work, people can get into trouble, because there is an auto union strike in Mumbai

 The strike of the Auto Union is not only in Mumbai, but all over Maharashtra
 hadtaal se mumbai ke 1 lakh 80 hajaar or rajya ke kareeb saadhe saat lakh autoricshaw prabhavit honge

 aise main rajya main sattadhari dal samaajawaadee party ne congress party se gathbandhan kiya he
 At the same time, former party chief and Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav, who has been sidelined from his post and party after internal politics of the party, has turned against this alliance
 gathbandhan ke elaan ke turant baad mulaayam singh yadav ne gathbandhan kaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki samaajawaadee party ko gathbandhan kii jarurat nahin thi
 The party should have contested on its own
 unhone kaha ki rajya main samaajawaadee party ke khilaaf koi anti inakambency fector nahin tha
 Nevertheless the party formed an alliance
 mulaayam singh yadav kii naaraazgi kaa alam kuch yun he ki unhone gathbandhan dharm ke khilaaf apane samarthak netaaon se kaha he ki vah congress party ke pratyaashiyon ke khilaaf nirdaleey rup se chunaav laden
 Mulayam Singh Yadav is called into politics by the name of 'mulla Mulayam' after he was ordered to shoot at karsevaks going to Ram temple in Ayodhya
 mulaayam singh yadav ne raajnneeti main daanv chalate hue congress par hamalaa kiya or ek baar phir congress ke khilaaf mukhar ho gaye
 He has called upon the party leaders who are not getting tickets from these seats to file an independent form to defeat the Congress candidates from these seats
 mulaayam singh yadav pehle hi kah chuke hai ki vah is gathbandhan ke samarthan main prachaar nahin karenge
 But now he also said that if needed, he will campaign against the Congress candidates in those seats so that the Congress candidates can be defeated
 tippaniyan Sources are telling that if the Congress party wins in a good number in the state, it can join hands with the BSP if needed
 mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki akhilesh or rahul gandhi kii saajha press conference main rahul gandhi kaa bahujan samaaj party prati rukh yah ishaara karata he
 Rahul Gandhi, while taking a soft stand on BSP, said that he personally respects BSP chief Mayawati a lot
 mana ja rahaa he ki rahul gandhi bispi se dosti kii gunjaaish ko khatm nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 The Congress will not go with the BJP and non-bjp parties will suit them
 mulaayam singh yadav kii baat asar bhi dikhne laga he
 Some SP leaders have also filled the form by changing the party
 kai or netaaon ke parchaa bharne kii baat bhi kahi ja rahi he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's resentment is such that he has asked his supporters against coalition religion to contest independently of the candidates of the Congress party
 ayodhya main ram mandir ke liye ja rahe karsevakon par goli chalaane ke aadesh dene ke baad mulaayam singh yadav ko 'mullah mulaayam' ke naam se raajnneeti main pukaara jaataa he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav attacked the Congress with stakes in politics and once again became vocal against the Congress
 unhone in siton se tikat na paane vaale party ke netaaon kaa aahvaan kiya he ki vah in siton se congress pratyaashiyon ko haraane ke liye nirdaleey hi parchaa daakhil karen
 Mulayam Singh Yadav has already said that he will not campaign in support of this alliance
 lekin ab unhone yah bhi kaha ki agar jarurat hui to vah congress ke pratyaashiyon ke khilaaf un siton par prachaar karenge taaki congress ke ummidavaaron ko haraaya ja sake
 The comments sutara bataa rahe hai ki rajya main acchhee sankhya main yadi congress party jeet darj karti he to vah jarurat padane par bispi se haath mila sakati he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav said that this gesture of Rahul Gandhi's attitude towards Bahujan Samaj Party in the joint press conference of Akhilesh and Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ne bispi par naram rukh apanaate hue kaha tha ki vah nijee taur par bispi pramukh mayawati kaa bahut sammaan karte hai
 It is believed that Rahul Gandhi does not want to end the scope of friendship with BSP
 congress bijepi ke saath nahin jaaegi or gaiyr-bijepi dal hi unke liye mufeed honge
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's talk has started showing effect
 kuch sapa netaaon ne dal badalakar parchaa bhi bhar diya he
 There is also talk of filling the form of many more leaders
 mulaayam singh yadav pehle hi kah chuke hai ki vah is gathbandhan ke samarthan main prachaar nahin karenge
 But now he also said that if needed, he will campaign against the Congress candidates in those seats so that the Congress candidates can be defeated

 The terrorists, who arrived in Pathankot from Pakistan, stormed into the airbase after tearing down the wall of the Air Force Station

 The heat of the heat in Kasganj is now slowing down, but the politics is starting to burn
 dipti siem ne to yahaan tak kah diya he ki iske peeche badi sajeesh he
 The big question is why the rioters could not be completely controlled even 48 hours after the start of the uproar
 These five major negligence have come to the fore in the violence in Kasganj
 1
 Why the curfew was lifted soon The administration imposed curfew soon after the ruckus started on 26 January, but curfew was lifted and section 144 was imposed in the area after a few hours
 sawaal uthta he ki jab tanaav kaayam tha to aise main karfu hataane main hadabadi kyon dikhaai gai
 Despite the presence of 700 to 800 policemen on the spot, where are the forces getting strength and how did they manage to set arson and vandalism till this morning
 kyon dangaiyon ko itani chhot di gai ki ve aagjanee kar saken
 2
 lakhanu se koi aalaa-afasar nahin pahunchakasganj main hinsa hone ke tisare din bhi yani ravivaar subah tak aagjanee kii chhitput ghatnaayen hoti raheen
 On the very next day of the stir, the administration kept claiming strictness
 iske baavjood 48 ghante tak puraa ilaaka jalataa rahaa
 Bawali kept fussy on the road
 prashasan kii laaparvaahee dikhti rahi
 Neither the fire stopped nor the vandalism
 lakhanu se koi aalaa afasar bhi nahin pahunchaa
 That is, everything was left in the hands of officers of district and range
 3
 Action was taken on delay
 The administration took very late action on violence
 shuruyaat main hi agar maamle kii gambhirtha ko samaj liya jaataa to naubat yahaan tak na aati
 With the immediate removal of the curfew, the rioters were not allowed to do any detriment at the same time as they were given free leeway, which resulted in violence on the third day
 haalanki ab aropiyon par rasuka tak lagane kii baat kii ja rahi he
 4
 raajnneetik bayaanbajihinsa bhadakne ke baad se hi siyaasi bayaanbaji shuru ho gai
 On the third day, she openly came from Akhilesh Yadav to Mayawati
 sapa adhyaksh or soobe ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne kasganj kii ghatana ke liye sarkaar ke adhikariyon ko doshi tehraaya
 He has even demanded a compensation of 50 lakhs to Chandan Gupta
 saath hi chandan ke ghar jane kii baat bhi kahi he
 At the same time, Mayawati said that the current situation proves that BJP and Company has been 'grossly criminalized' at every level
 congress netaa pramod tiwari ne aarope lagaaya ki uttar pradesh sarkaar or sthaneey prashasan kii laaparvaahee evam kuprabandhan ke kaaran kasganj main do samudaayon ke bich jhadpen hui
 5
 koi bijepi kaa bada netaa shant karaane nahin pahunchahinsa ke 55 ghante baad bhi sarkaar kaa koi mantri maukey par nahin pahunchaa
 No one reached the spot and tried to maintain peace
 aaj pis meeting bhi hui, usamen bhi kisi ne dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 If a big leader came forward then the tension could be reduced
 saal 1980 main hue swedish company se boforce topein kharidi gai thim
 But there was a lot of controversy over the deal and the then central government was accused of corruption
 uske baad se bhartiya sena ke liye koi top nahin kharida gaya
 However, during the Kargil War, the Indian Army forced the Pakistan Army to retreat on the basis of Bofors cannons

 koyala khan aavanton main gadabadi ko lekar vipaksh ke nishane par aaye pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne palatwaar kii taiyaari kar lee he jisamen kaha ja saktaa he ki nijee companiyon ko 1
 The figure of Rs 85 lakh crore profit is 'misleading'
 sutron ke anusaar pradhanmantri ne sansad main vipaksh ke aaropon kii kaat ke liye chah binduon vaala jawaab taiyaar kiya he par donon sadanon kii kaarywahi main vyavdhaan ke kaaran ve jawaab nahin de sake hai
 Manmohan emphasizes that the allocation of coal blocks was done in a completely appropriate and transparent manner without favoring any company
 vipakshi partiyaan is mudde par hangaamaa kar rahi hai or pichley do din se sansad kii kaarywahi nahin chal paa rahi he
 Sources said that the emphasis of the reply prepared by the Prime Minister is that all the non-upa governments of the states of Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Odisha and Jharkhand had opposed the Center to bring a bill in 2005 about the auction process
 
 jawaab main unhone koyala block aavanton main pratispardhi boli prakriya shuru karne main deree ke liye in rajyon kii sarkaron dwaara kiye gayi virodh ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 According to him, 'despite being against the proposal of various parties, states and ministries, there is a need to change the relevant law and build consensus before any new approach can be implemented
 ’ baharhaal, boli ke jariye nilaamee kaa kanoon ab taiyaar kar liya gaya he
 CAG has also mentioned in its report the delay in allocation of coal blocks
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha he, ‘jo bhi mudde uthaaye gayi hai vah sabhi kaa santoshprad jawaab de sakate hai
 While replying to the CAG report, the Prime Minister says that he finds 'mistakes' in this
 kaig report main kaha gaya he ki varsh 2005 se 2009 ke bich koyala khan aavanton main vibhinn khaamiyon ke chalate nijee kshetra kii companiyon ko 1
 a profit of Rs 85 lakh crore was reached
 pradhanmantri kaa kahana he ki kaig ne is aankade kii gananaa 57 khaanon ke aavanton ke aadhaar par kii he, jabaki isamen se 31 koyala khaane 2006 se pehle kii hai
 Apart from this, he also estimated the amount of loss as misleading
 unhone kaha ki kaig ne nuksaan kaa anumaan kol india ke mulya ke hisaab se lagaaya he, jabaki nijee kshetra kii companiyon ke laagat ke bare main alag maandand hote hai
 Manmohan has also objected to the CAG raising questions on the government's policy decision
 kaig ne apni report main kanoon mantralay kii is raay kaa zikr kiya he jisamen mantralay ne kaha he ki iske liye vaikalpik athwa vidhaan main parivartan ho yaa phir pratispardhi boli shuru karne ke liye prashasnic nirdesh ke vikalp ko chunaa janaa chaiye
 This was a policy decision of the Ministry
 sutron ke anusaar boli ke jariye nilaamee karne sambandhi kanoon banane main deree ke aarope par pradhanmantri kaa kahana he ki isamen lagane vaali prakriya kii vajah se hi nahin balki sahmati banaate huye kisi nirnay par pahunchane main hone vaale vichaar vimarsh ke chalate saamaanya kanoon banane main bhi kaaphi samay lag jaataa he
 In this regard, the government says that the proposal to amend the Coal Mines (nationalization) Act was pending since 2001
 us samay bhartiya janata party ke netritv vaala rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) satta main tha
 The government's motive behind emphasizing these points is the time it takes to 'seriously discuss' and 'build consensus on sensitive issues' before the bill is placed in Parliament
 pradhanmantri kaa jor is baat par bhi he ki nijee istemaal hetu koyala block kii nilaamee ke liye pratispardhi boli prakriya shuru karne ke vaaste dishanirdesh or sambandhit prakriya taiyaar kerani hoti he
 The rules were notified on 2 February this year after due deliberations
 manmohan kaa jawaab kaig kii is daleel ke bhi khilaaf hoga ki koyala utpaadan badhaane ke liye kol india ke arakshit block unhen nijee istemaal ke liye aavantit karne kii koyala mantralay kii yojana ke vaanchit parinaam nahin mili
 The government says that coal production in the year 2004

 The National Green Tribunal has asked the Government of Uttar Pradesh and its Pollution Control Board on the issue of regulation of tanning plants built along the Ganges in Kanpur
 engiti ne poocha he ki yadi in donon ke adhikari ‘‘charm shodhan kaarkaane ke parisaron main pravesh bhi nahin kar sakate’’ to unka niyaman kaise kar sakate hai
 The NGT said that the pollutants released from tanning plants contain large amounts of chromium and are polluting the Ganges
 yahaan tak ki uttarapradesh pradooshan niyantran board bhi ab tak in shodhan kaarkaanon kii asal sankhya ke bare main nahin jaanata tha
 a bench headed by NGT chairman Justice Swatanter Kumar said, "AAP (uttar Pradesh and Pollution Control Board) says that the operation of tanning factories should be regular
 lekin hamen ek baat bataaie ki yadi aapke log unke parisaron main ghus bhi nahin sakate to aap uskaa niyaman kaise karenge?’’ peeth kii ore se yah tippanee ek aise samay par ai he jab uttarapradesh pradooshan niyantran board ne peeth ko bataaya he ki kanpur main 400 charm shodhan kaarkaane hai, jo jajamau naale main pradooshak chhodte hai
 To make Ganga clean, it is very important to monitor their operation
 adhikaran ne kaha ki jajamau ke sabhi charm shodhan kaarkaane chromium pun: prapti sanyantron se las nahin hai or inase nikalne vaale pradooshkon se nipatane ke liye tatkaal prayaas kiye jane jaruri hai
 The tribunal had earlier asked the refining factories to clarify their stand on the issue of shifting elsewhere to prevent uncontrolled flow of pollutants into the river
 beete 15 november ko adhikaran ne sarkaar ko haridwar or unnav ke bich ganga ke kayakalp par ‘ek paisa bhi na kharch karne’ kii hidaayat dete hue kaha tha ki puri rashtriya pariyojna par ve adhikari 20 hajaar karod rupee kii badi raashi kharch kar rahe hai, jo nadi ke bare main jaanate tak nahin hai

 Even the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board was not yet aware of the actual number of these refining factories
 engiti ke adhyaksh nyaayamurti swatantra kumaar kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne kaha, ‘‘aap (uttarapradesh or pradooshan niyantran board) kehete hai ki charm shodhan kaarkaanon kaa sanchaalan niyamit hona chahie
 But tell us one thing that if your people cannot even enter their premises then how will you regulate it? ”the comment from the bench came at a time when the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board told the bench that in Kanpur There are 400 tanning plants, which release pollutants into the Jajmau drain
 ganga ko svachh banane ke liye inke sanchaalan par najar rakhana behad jaruri he
 The tribunal said that not all of Jajmau's tanning plants are equipped with chromium recovery plants and urgent efforts are needed to deal with the pollutants released from them
