 2> 3— Shatrughan Sinha (@shatrugansinha) September 28, 2017 Yashwant has done a big war
 Let us tell you that former finance minister Yashwant Sinha has written an article in an English newspaper
 jisamen unhone notebandi ke faisle par bhi sarkaar ko aade haathon liya, unhone kaha ki notebandi ne girti jidipi main aag main tel daalane kii tarah kaam kiya

 The civic agencies of Delhi have proved to be laggards in the Delhi from which the cleanliness campaign was started by the Prime Minister of India
 darasal centre sarkaar ne swatchta abhiyaan ke liye paisa muhaiyaa karaayaa tha, lekin dilli kii do civik agenciyaan uttari nagar nigam or purvi dilli nagar nigam uskaa ek rupee bhi kharch nahin kar pain
 Delhi government blamed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream is to clean his country, but in the capital of the country, Civic agencies are discounting this dream
 darasal swatchta abhiyaan ke liye centre sarkaar se mili madad kaa ye agenciyaan ek rupee bhi kharch nahin kar pai
 The MCD is blaming the Delhi government for all this because the North Municipal Corporation and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation are cash-strapped, while both mcds are demanding the Delhi government to implement the fourth Finance Commission

 MCD can spend money from the Center and Delhi government only when MCD invests 74 percent of the money first and the situation is that MCD is going through financial crisis
 emsidi kaa share kam karne kii vinatthibhi tak sarkaar kii taraf se uttari nagar nigam ko 2015-16 main swatchta abhiyaan ke liye 46
 28 crores, while East Dillinagar Corporation has received 42 crores for 2015-16, but has not been able to spend it
 emsidi ne centre sarkaar se emsidi kaa share kam karne kii vinati kii, phir agast 2016 main ye faisla kiya gaya he ki swatchta abhiyaan ke liye 35 pratishat paisa centre sarkaar, 6 pratishat paisa dilli sarkaar jabaki emsidi 59 pratishat paisa kharch kar karegi
 Where will the money come from? After all, the big question is where will the money come from the MCD

 Politics on money is currently going on in Delhi on this ambitious project of Modi government

 But even if the plane crashed, it should get some traces

 'andre ne bataaya ki dakshin africa main har saal 250 se adhik aise maamle aate hai, jisamen purush ke privet part ko transplant karne ke alaava koi doosraa upaay nahin hota
 The success was not yet achieved, so people had to be disappointed, but glad that it is possible now

 do chashmadid or aaramail aspataal ke doctor ne daawa kiya ki consteble ke jism par gambhir chot ke nishaan nahin the
 However, the Delhi Police claimed on the basis of the post-mortem report that the constable died due to injury
 mangalvaar ko dilli police ke kamishnar niraj kumaar ne bayaan diya tha ki consteble subhash tomars kii dange main maut hui thi
 At the same time, the statement of the doctor who treated the constable, came that he died of cardiac arrest
 vahiin ek chashmadid ne dilli police ke daavon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki subhash tomars ko kisi ne pathar nahin maaraa
 Delhi Police is now embroiled in the controversy, surrounded by the allegations of SDM of Vivek Vihar of Delhi
 is baar vivaad aisa he jisane dilli police kii saakh par hi sawaal uthaa die hai
 Captain of Delhi Police Neeraj Kumar, quoting the doctor, claimed that the constable Tomar had died from injury
 unka ye bhi daawa he ki ye chotein ravivaar ko india get par gang rape ke khilaaf pradarshan karne aae updravi bheed ne pahunchaai thi
 But, the doctors of Rammanohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi, who treated Constable Tomar, are themselves questioning this

 TS Sidhu gave the statement that Subhash Tomar had come to the Total Colleps Stage

 The post-mortem report has said almost the same thing that was claimed by Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar on Tuesday
 report ke mutabik consteble tomars ko kisi baari cheez se gardan or seene par chot lagi thi or ho saktaa he ki chot kii vajah se hi unhen dil kaa daura padaa ho
 According to the post-mortem report, Constable Tomar had a fracture in the rib
 unke seene ke baayen hisse, daayin baanh ke upree hisse main chot ke nishaan the
 There were also scratches in the body
 seene ke daaen hisse, haath ke peeche or kohni par laal nishaan the
 But according to sources, the high officials of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital have claimed that their doctors did not see any marks of injury on the constable's body
 consteble kii maut dil kaa daura padane se hi hui he naa ki chot se
 Clearly, there is still a contradiction in the statements

 Public Public Distribution System (PDS) is synonymous with corruption and has received 503 complaints from across the country in the last three years, the most shocking fact being that only 66 to april-june this year amid the ongoing campaign against corruption
 Complaints have been received
 inamen sabase zyada uttar pradesh se 27, dilli se 9, haryana-rajasthan se 6-6 shikaayatein shaamil hai
 While the small state of Chhattisgarh, which came into existence just ten years ago, has set a great example and this year there was not a single complaint
 desh bhar main peedies kii kareeb paanch lakh dukaane hai, jo 18 karod pariwaron ko laabh pahunchane ke makasad se kholi gai hai
 The PDS, considered the world's largest grain distribution scheme, has an annual outlay of Rs 50,000 crore
 kharrch hote hai
 But the official number of complaints in the PDS, which has become the center of corruption, is continuously increasing
 saal 2008 main desh bhar se 94 shikaayatein mili thim, to 2009 main 169, 2010 main 174 or 2011 ke shuruaati teen maheene main hi 66 shikaayatein darj ho chuki hai
 Among these, the most pathetic situation is in Uttar Pradesh, where 123 per cent of the country's complaints have been received in three years
 congress shasit rajya dilli se 101, haryana se 41 or rajasthan se 26 shikaayatein centre sarkaar ko mili hai jabaki isi dauraan bhaajapa shasit rajya gujarat se mahaj aath or chhattisgarh se 10 shikaayatein mili hai
 According to data from the Union Ministry of Food Consumers, states have also taken action on complaints
 pichley teen saal main desh bhar main kul 28,22,384 jagahon kaa nirikshan kiya gaya, 5,54,432 jagahon par chaape maare gaye or 18,045 logon ko aropit kiya gaya
 But this action does not seem to have any effect
 duusari taraf chhattisgarh ne apni sabhi 10,549 rashan dukaanon kaa databes taiyaar kar unhen sabhi jila khaadya daftaron ko internet se jod aisa network banaaya he ki aam aadmi khud nigaraanee rakh sake
 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh says, "when i used to go to village Suraj Yatra earlier, most of the complaints were about PDS
 lekin is baar ek bhi shikaayat nahin ai
 The Supreme Court has also recently advised the central government to implement this modern computerized system across the country, terming the bjp-ruled states of Chhattisgarh and Gujarat as model states in the PDS
 amuman yah mana jaataa he ki peedies se bhrashtachar ke ghun ko baahar nahin nikaala ja saktaa
 But Chhattisgarh had just Rs 23 crore through its own resource-generated software and hardware
 main ek aisa network bana diya, jisaki aaj chautarafa tarif ho rahi he
 Raman Singh says, "so far, representatives from nine states have visited and seen our model
 haal hi main britain kii vipaksh kii netaa ne bhi do din rahakar is yojana kii baarikiyon ko dekha
 “it is clear that the PDS model of Chhattisgarh is a great example of political will

 shukla kehete hai, ''chaaval utsav ke din hi 40 fisadi anaaj kaa uthaav hone laga or maukey par logon kii shikaayat dur hone lagi
 "for this e-campaign of the state, this team was also awarded the PM Excellence Award for the year 2008-09, which started work in april-may and implemented it from November 1, 2008

 More than 200 days after JNU student Najeeb Ahmed went missing, the Delhi Police has now asked mosques in the national capital and neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh to make regular announcements about Najeeb, hoping to find a clue in the matter
 najeeb 14 oktober kii raat ko abivipi sadasyon ke saath uske hostel main kathith taur par hue jhagade ke baad se laapata he
 The police has announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for giving any kind of information about him
 najeeb ke laapata hone kii jaanch main abhi tak police ke haath koi suraag nahin laga he
 a senior police officer said, "despite several teams working on this matter, we failed to get any clue
" ’’ ab unhone masjidon se madad maangi he
 Investigating officials met the Imam of Fatehpuri Mosque in Chandni Chowk and requested him to announce Najeeb during the Namaz
 ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘hamane logon se najeeb ke bare main koi bhi suraag yaa soochna saajha karne kii apil karne ke liye kaha
 We have requested to make regular announcements in Delhi, neighboring areas and some cities like Badaun, Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh
 ’’ police ne masjidon kii yatra karne vaali ‘‘jamaaton’’ ke saath uske laapata hone kii soochna saajha karne kaa bhi anurodh kiya he
 Meanwhile, Najib's family members said that they have lost confidence in the police
 najeeb ke bhai mujeeb ne kaha, ‘‘pehle din kii tarah aaj bhi najeeb ke bare main hamaare paas koi suraag nahin he
 He said that the police did nothing special to trace his brother and only "harassed" him
 in sabake bich bhi parivaar ko ab bhi najeeb kii vaapasi kii ummid he
 Whenever his family members get a call from an unknown number, they always feel that it may be Najeeb
 tippaniyan Najib's mother Fatima said, "I don't cry in front of my children because they too are going through difficult times
" lekin jab bhi main allaah se dua maangati hum to roti hum
 Whenever Najeeb's food is cooked or something related to it, i miss him a lot
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘police ne mere bete kii nakaaratmak chhavi pesh kii he
 He is good-natured
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki vah laut aayega
 '' (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Till now, police have not left any clue in the investigation of Najeeb's disappearance
 ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘is maamle par kai tiimon ke kaam karne ke baavjood ham koi bhi suraag paane main naakaam rahe
 "now they have asked for help from mosques
" jaanch adhikariyon ne chandani chowk main fatehpuri masjid ke imam se mulaakaat kii or unase namaaj ke dauraan najeeb ke bare main elaan karne kaa anurodh kiya

 "police have also requested to share information about his disappearance with" Jamaatans "who visit mosques
 is bich, najeeb ke parivaar ke sadasyon ne kaha ki unka police se bharosa uth gaya he

" ’’ unhone kaha ki police ne unke bhai kaa pataa lagane ke liye kuch khaas nahin kiya or keval unhen ‘‘pratadit’’ kiya he
 Amidst all this, the family still hopes for Najeeb's return
 jab bhi unke parivaar ke sadasyon ke paas kisi anjaan number se phone aata he to unhen hameshaa lagata he ki yah najeeb ho saktaa he
 The comments najeeb kii maa fatima ne kaha, ‘‘main apane bacchon ke saamne nahin roti kyonki ve bhi mushkil daur se guzar rahe hai
 But whenever i pray to Allah i cry
 jab bhi najeeb kii pasand kaa khaanaa pakataa he yaa usase judi koi or baat hoti he to main use bahut yaad karti hum

 ise lekar navi mumbai main jameen dhundhane kii kavayat bhi shuru ho gai he
 According to information received from the sources, the Home Ministry of the Maharashtra government has asked the Navi Mumbai Planning Authority to give the land to build the detention center
 is khabar kii pushti mantralay se jude sutron ne bhi kii he
 Let me tell you that a few days ago, with the release of the NRC list by the Government of India, more than 19 lakh people were declared foreigners in Assam
 ab aisi ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki sarkaar maharashtra main bhi assam ke tarj par hi aise logon kaa pataa lagaaegi or unhen inhi hiraasat kendron main rakhaa jayega
 According to information received from the sources, a letter has been written to the Maharashtra City and Industry Development Corporation Department, which has asked to give two to three acres of land in Nerul
 nerul navi mumbai main aata he jo mumbai se mahaj 20 kilometre kii duuri par he
 However, reports of any such letter being sent by the ministry have been misunderstood

 sonoval ne in logon ko kanoonee sahaayta muhaiyaa karaane kaa bhi aashwaasan diya
 He also said that if a person's name is left out of the final list of NRC to be published on Saturday, it does not mean that he has become a foreigner
 kyonki uchit kanoonee prakriya ke baad videshi nyaayaadhikaran (apat) hi is sambandh main nirnay le saktaa he
 Let me tell you, Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) cannot be seen as a "red letter" for Assamese society
 bijepi netaa ne sanket die the ki unhen is baat par thodaa bharosa tha ki yah list videshiyon se chhutkaaraa paane main madad karegaa
 Sarma had told local journalists on Friday that after the drafts have come, we have lost hope in view of the present scenario of NRC

 An old photograph of former IPS officer Kiran Bedi and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has gone viral

 This post has mentioned about the Odisha incident in the past, in which an IAS was suspended after the search of Prime Minister Modi's helicopter
 india today anti phek news war room (AFWA) ye daawa bhraamak he
 The viral picture has nothing to do with the carriage incident and Bedi never lifted Indira Gandhi's car from a crane
 khabar likhe jane tak kareeb ek hajaar se zyada logon ne is khabar ko share kiya tha
 This page of 'IT & Social Media Cell Congress' is followed by about 4 lakh people
 ek or fasebuk yujar samual jorge ne bhi ye tasviir post kii or likhaa
 It is difficult to find a leader like Indira Gandhi
 jab galat parking ke liye kiran bedi ne piem kii gaadi kaa chaalaan kaat diya to indira ji ne unki bahaduree ke sammaan ke liye khud unhen bhojan par bulaayaa
 More than 1200 people shared this post, while many others also posted on Facebook with the same claim

 Referring to his proximity to Indira Gandhi, he wrote that these pictures are from January 2017
 unhone likhaa- ganatantr diwas kii parade lead karne ke liye pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne subah ke naashte par aamantrit kiya
 It was a rare privilege being withmrs Indira Gandhi
 i was very fond of her
 She was too proud of my having joined the IPS
 She used invite me to her functions and introduce me as India's first woman in the officer ranks of IPS

 com / x4z02nfvfk — Kiran Bedi (@thekiranbedi) November 19, 2017 When we started collecting information about Kiran Bedi's famous car scandal, we got a 2015 NDTV article
 isamen barkhaa dutt ke sho kaa zikr he jahaan bedi se car uthaane kii ghatana se judaa sawaal poocha gaya tha
 Bedi then clearly stated that she never picked up Indira Gandhi's car
 reporter ke mutabik 1982 main indira gandhi ke offis kii ambesder car ko sab inspector nirmal singh ne uthva liya tha jo galat tareeke se park kii gai thi
 But Kiran Bedi admitted that as a DCP, she defended her junior officer and did not allow action against him
 viral tasviir 1975 main lee gai or car uthaane kii ghatana kareeb 7 saal baad 1982 main hui
 So this picture has nothing to do with this incident, but whether Bedi was encouraged after this incident
 aam dharna ke ulat kiran bedi ne enditivi ke intervyuu main daawa kiya ki sajaa ke taur par unhen 7 maheene ke liye goa transfar kar diya gaya tha

 Directed by Sunny Deol, son Karan Deol's debut film Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas has been released on Friday
 yah ek lav story film he jisamen kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 The film has been shot on real locations whose work appears on screen but Karan's acting is disappointing
 sahar bamba kaa kaam acha he
 Apart from this, the story of the film is also very weak
 jab audiyans vir-jaaraa, rockstar, barfi or oktober jaisi filmein dekh chuki he jisamen lav story kaa ek alag hi level dikhaaya gaya he to aise main karan-sahar kii simple lav story bilkul bhi prabhavit nahin karti he
 Kahan Deol plays Karan Sehgal and Sahar Bamba in the story Sahar Sethi
 karan ek trekking company ke maalik hai jo manali main sanchalit he
 Sahar's house has a family reunion plan, but she does not want to attend it
 aise main vah parivaar ke saamne asinament kaa bahaanaa banaakar karan kii company kii sarvice kaa rivyuu karne ke liye dilli se manali chali jaati hai
 In the first half, Sahar and Karan find trekking on dangerous and high mountains interesting and real
 iske alaava manali kii khubsuurati ko bhi parde par shandaar tareeke se parosa gaya he

 yahi se kahani aage badhati he
 There is also a confrontation between Karan and Viren but there is nothing new in the story
 script bojhil lagati he or film slo moshan main chalati rahati he
 Sahar Bamba's acting affects more than Karan in actingfilm
 vah parde par confident dikhti hai or aisa bilkul bhi nahin lagata he ki yah unki pehali film he
 Sahar's anger, emotions and love expressions are reflected in his acting
 vahiin karan ko apni acting main abhi or kaam karne kii jarurat he
 In terms of facial expression, body language and acting, he appears to be very weak
 lekin haa, film main vah oonche-oonche pahaado par trekking karte hue sahaj dikhaai dete hai
 His work in this matter is worthy
 unhone shooting se pehle trekking kii 10 maheene training lee thi jiskaa kaam parde par saaf dikhataa he
 directionsunny Deol has done a good direction but when there is no newness in the story, no matter how good the direction is, the audience is not impressed
 sani ne manali ke khubasurat or shandaar lokation ko dikhaane ke liye apni nirdesan kala kaa behtareen istemaal kiya he
 The work done on camera work and visuals is good
 musicafilm kaa becoground score acha he lekin isamen ek bhi aisa gaanaa nahin he jo logon kii jubaan par chadh jaae

 On the third day of Sahitya Aaj Tak 2018, actor Annu Kapoor spoke strongly on all issues
 is dauraan unhone kaha ki main ye sapana dekhtaa hum ki mere desh kaa ek maamuli kisaan manahattan ke saraphino restaurant main jaae or kadak chaay pie
 The actor said, the early years of my career were spent in poverty
 actor main dilli main hi ban gaya tha, par mumbai paisa kamaane ke liye aayaa tha
 i still worship money today
 lekin mehnat or eemaandaaree se kamaaye paise kii
 
 
 To earn money, i will not cut your pocket, will not sell the country and will not cut your throat
 
 
 
 India is the only country in the world where legal
 saamaajik or dharmik rup se dhan kii puja kii jaati he
 The actor said, "until the poverty of the village does not end, it is difficult to move mentally
" main sapana dekhtaa hum ki manahattan ke saraphino restaurant main desh kaa ek maamuli kisaan jaae or pine ke liye kadak chaay order kare
 The bill comes to 20 dollars
 banda 50 dollar kaa patta nikaalata he
 He does it on the bill and says, keep the change with you, you are yours
 " actor ne baatcheet ke dauraan ye bhi kaha ki rupee se bada secular kuch bhi nahin hota
 The pocket will be warm, then prosperity will come
 "when the pocket is hot, you will not consider a honeymoon in Pachkula
 switzraland or finland main honeymoon manegaa
 These great people who perform five to five hundred million marriages and keep looking poor
 desh kaa aam aadmi jab jarurat kii chijen puri kar legaa, tab uskaa maansik str badhegaa
 Then the prosperity of the country will come
 "shaharon ke naam badalane par kya bole annu kapur?shaharon ke naam badalane or stechu kii raajnneeti ko annu kapur ne jaij tehraaya
 He said, "I am a very nationalist
 lekin main kisi vichaardhaara yaa party ko follow nahin karata
 You will leave your marks on the day you are the winner
 har vijeta apni nishaani chodta he
 When you win, you also change the name
 "actorne kaha, "agar bharat kahin jeetta hota (desh se baahar) to medicin squaire main ladi gaaga yaa jackson nahin, pandit bhimsen joshi kaa gayan hota
 There are many people who talk only in the country
 raashtragan hona koi galat nahin he
 Discipline is necessary, because the country is full of corrupt people
 agar bharat ne chintan nahin badla, to kuch nahin hoga

According to Delhi government sources, a draft has been prepared to give exemption to women in DTC buses first
 - pehle ditisi bason main mahilaon ko kiraye main chhot di jaaegi - a discount of Rs 10 can be given on every journey - chhot ke liye paas ke bajaay kaagaz ke gulabi tikat die jaaenge - Cabinet note has been prepared on the whole draft - puure masaude par vibhinn vibhaagon kii raay lee ja rahi hemetro kii muft yatra dilli metro or kendra ke adhikariyon ke bich funs rahi he, yahi vajah he ki dilli sarkaar pehle ditisi bason se shuruyaat karne ja rahi he
 The Delhi government does not want the delay in the announcement of free travel of metro and buses to women to raise questions on the intention of the Delhi government, which is why Kejriwal is trying to give a message to women in DTC buses by giving them ticket discounts

 salmaan bole ki mere pita saleem khan thik kehete hai ki kuch log or dal jabaran narendra modi ke peeche pade hai
 Salim Khan had said that more terrible riots have taken place in Mumbai and Bhagalpur than in Gujarat
 log in dangon ke dauraan mukhyamantri rahe netaaon par sawaal nahin uthaate
 On the same lines, Salman Khan also said that the person who has been acquitted by the judiciary of the country, who are you and you, who repeatedly raise questions
 jo sawaal uthaate hai, kya unhen nyaaypalika par bharosa nahin
 On the issue of Narendra Modi being wrong in getting close to Modi, Salman Khan said that our court, CBI gave him a clean chit
 khalas
 End of Story
 to phir baat hi kya rah jaati he
 He said that if i grow closer to him as i go to Ahmedabad, then what is wrong with it
 salmaan khan bole ki dekho sar, amitabh bachchan gaye, ajay devgan gaye, paresh rawal gaye, kuch hua kya
 Mukesh Ambani and Tata praised him so much, what happened? magar salmaan khan narendra modi ke paas gaya, to itnaa hangaamaa hua
 Why sirf isliye ki meraa naam salmaan khan he
 Some people are forcibly promoting my Muslim identity
 jab main gujarat gaya, to mujhe vahaan musalmaan mili
 Some parties and people did not like this thing
 congress kaa saporter nahin hum mansalmaan khan ne kaha ki desh kaa piem koun hoga, ye tay karnaa meraa kaam nahin he
 i can only choose MP and MLA
 ahmedabad main die apane bayaan ko doharaate hue unhone kaha ki haa main baba siddiki or priya dutt ko vot duungaa
 But his party has no role in it
 ye log nirdaleey chunaav ladenge, tab bhi meraa vot inhen hi jayega kyonki ye achche log hai
 Salman said on becoming the best man PM, see that i am not following politics
 mujhe nahin pataa kisne kitna kaam kiya
 You pray to the above for everything
 ye to desh kaa masalaa he
 So what is wrong in praying to the one above
 salmaan ne kaha ki main apni opinian se logon ko prabhavit nahin karnaa chahta
 These people decide what political leadership they want
 mere pita nahin ladenge chunaavsalmaan khan ke pita saleem khan kii narendra modi se kaaphi najdiki bataai jaati he
 Can he contest elections from Gujarat as well? is sawaal par salmaan ne saaf kiya ki nahin, daddy chunaav nahin ladenge

 These are the only two kisses
 inhen donon kii ladaai he
 There is a fight between good and evil
 aam aadmi se prerit kahani kya kejariwal kii safalataa bhunaane ke liye he
 On this question, Salman Khan said that Jai Ho's story was ready two and a half years ago
 us vakt to kejariwal itane bade nahin hue the
 So i can say that we are not following Kejriwal, but he is following us
 kejariwal ko naseehat dete hue salmaan ne kaha ki good main hona auki govern karnaa do alag chijen hai
 Though good intentions can be learned
 meri tasviir jalaane se fark nahin padatasaifai mahotsav or ahmedabad main patang udaane par hue virodh ko darkinar karte hue salmaan khan ne kaha, mujhe in sabase fark nahin padataa
 He said that my pictures have always been ablaze
 ve jalaaen, dafnaayen yaa phaaden, mujhe unase koi lenaa dena nahin
 With this much to say, Salman also made it clear that the police administration of every province will have to see that the release of Jai Ho is done in a peaceful manner, so that those who have come to see the film will not have any problem
 salmaan ne kaha ki mutthi bhar log jhuthe prachaar ke liye kahin kahin camaron ke saamne virodh kaa naatak karte hai
 The government will have to stop these
 aag laga duun apane paison main, kisi ko kyasafai main jaakar parform karne ke sawaal par salmaan pehle bhi jawaab de chuke hai
 When this issue came up during the direct talk, he said that we are people from the entertainment industry
 hamen paise milte hai
 We dance un lakhon logon ke liye jo hamen dekhne aate hai
 If there are no people, we will not do these things
 or aisa nahin ki sirf paison ke liye karte hai
 We also attend the function of the Mumbai Police every year
 charity ke liye vahaan parform karte hai
 According to Salman, what is my morality, who are the other people to question this
 main apane paise jalaauun
 i divide it among the poor
 faad duun, kisi se kya lenaa dena
 i pay tax on my earnings

 unhone 20 lakh kii prise mani ke saath game choda
 Deepak comes from an economically weaker family
 isliye bahan kii shaadi ke bare main sochate hue unhone 20 lakh kaa brifces lekar game se baahar hone kaa faisla kiya
 Deepak Thakur played the game with full passion and passion in Big Bosshouse

 The results of the by-elections in Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats had come
 uttar pradesh main devaria jile ke ajaipura gaanv ke shivnath chaurasia (badla hua naam) aadhaar card kii anivaaryta ko lekar naaraaz dikhe
 The impact of the results of the by-election was still fresh in the public mind, which he said, 'mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav join hands in UP
 modi sarkaar ke niyam-kaayadon ne khetihar logon ko pareshaan kar diya he
 Banks go for Aadhaar cards whenever they go
 aadhaar card banavaane ke liye mujhe dasiyon chakkar lagane pade
 The machine made him cry to take a handprint
 ab aap hi bataaie ham kisaan aadmi hai, hatheliyaan kahaan bin mitti kii rahengi
 The machine does not recognize our hand mark properly
 koi bhi sarkari kaam do-chaar chakkar lagaae bina puraa nahin hota he
 There was never any such problem under the rule of mayawati-akhilesh
 ’basapa-sapa kaa asamanjasshivnath bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kii pramukh mayawati or samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke mukhiya akhilesh yadav kii jugalbandi main apni rosemara ke jivan kii sahuuliyat dekhte hai
 But the question is, will the heads of these political parties, which ever have influence in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, be united? Their political revolt is well known, but the results of the Lok Sabha elections 2014 and the subsequent defeat of non-nda parties in the assembly elections have forced them to come together
 yahi vajah rahi ki gorakhpur-phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav main basapa-sapa puraani pratidwandvita bhuulaakar ek saath ain
 The BSP did not field its candidate and supported the SP in both the places
 lekin is sab chizon ke baavjood agle aam chunaav main inamen gathbandhan hoga, is par abhi kuch bhi kaha nahin ja saktaa he
 BSP 19 in Uttar Pradesh in Lok Sabha Elections 2014
 7 pratishat mat hasil karne ke baavjood ek bhi seat jeet nahin pai jabaki sapa 22
 It managed to win five seats with 35 percent votes
 bijepi 42
 It managed to capture 63 seats with 71 percent of the vote
 vahiin, 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main basapa ko uttar pradesh kii 80 main se 20 siten milin or mat pratishat 28
 1 had been
 isi tarah vidhansabha chunaav 2017 main basapa 19 siten hi jeet pai jabaki sapa 54 siton par jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 These figures show how important it is for these two parties to form alliances in UP
 magar maujuuda siyaasi tasviir main gathjod kii philhal koi surat najar nahin aa rahi he
 The surat-e-hall Congress of the Grand Alliance is engaged in the exercise of forming a Grand Alliance on a pan-india level with like-minded parties
 haalanki uski abhi koi samgr tasviir banati hui nahin dikh rahi he, lekin bihar main vah mahagathbandhan banane main kaamyaab rahi
 Apart from Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), former Union Minister and Upendra Kushwaha-led Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), Jeetan Ram Manjhi's Hindustan Awam Morcha and Sharad Yadav's party, the Left parties are also in the grand alliance
 bihar main mahagathbandhan isliye bhi astitv main aa sakaa kyonki 2014 se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main jari jeet kaa silsilaa bihar main hi 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main tham paaya tha
 One of the major reasons for this was the formation of a grand alliance under the leadership of RJD chief Lalu Yadav, Janata Dal (U) leader and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Congress
 usee nattejey ko dohraane ke liye bihar main ek baar phir se mahagathbandhan astitv main aa chukaa he
 This grand alliance of Bihar is a message of unity for other regional parties of the country
 kya aakaar le paaengi third front kii kavayad?uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa or congress ke bich gathbandhan or rashtriya str paramhagathbandhanako lekar jari rassakashi ke bich ek prayaas third front banane ko lekar dekha ja saktaa he
 Chief Minister of Telangana and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) chief Chandrashekhar Rao is excited about the victory in the assembly elections
 vah aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ko lekar third front banane kii kavayad kar rahe hai
 In this connection, he has met West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamta Banerjee
 haalanki is mulaakaat kaa nichod kya rahaa, yah saaf nahin ho paaya
 While Akhilesh Yadav is yet to meet KC Rao and Mayawati did not give him an appointment
 baharhaal bataa den ki 2014 ke chunaavon main mamata banerjee khud bhi teesraa morcha banane kii koshish kar chuki hai, lekin kaaphi mehnat ke baad bhi jameen par third front astitv main nahin aa paaya
 The fight to save the bargain or the survival: As the Lok Sabha elections are approaching, the enthusiasts in the regional parties are intensifying to create a political picture
 chandrababu naidu kii telugu desham party (tidipi) pehle hi andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke mudde par endie se apana alag rasta chun chuki he
 tdp-congress appeared together in Telangana elections
 bihar main upendra kushvaha mahagathbandhan main shaamil ho chuke hai
 Apna Dal, Suheldev is eyeing the Bharatiya Samaj Party NDA
 lok janashakti party (lojpa) kii chetavanee ke baad bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko ramvilas paswan ko khushaamad karnaa padaa
 During the announcement of the grand alliance in Bihar, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav was saying that this alliance effort is a fight to save democracy
 kyonki maujuuda sarkaar taanaashaahee kaa rukh akhriyaar kiye hue
 Upendra Kushwaha whipped Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the same press conference
 unka kahana tha ki nitish ne unka apmaan kiya or piem modi bihar kii janata se kiya apana vaada puraa nahin kar sake
 The question is why Upendra Kushwaha, while being a partner in the NDA government at the Center for four years, did not feel that his state Bihar was being ignored by the Center
 aise main yahi sawaal uthta he ki kshetreey dalon kii dikhne vaali ekajutata vastav main astitv yaa loktantr bachaane kii ladaai he kori saudebaaji

 Jyotiraditya Scindia told that CM Kamal Nath has listened carefully to his talk and assured that after the rain stops completely, the survey of crops will be done
 'patrakaron ne jab jyotiraditya sindhiya se pradesh adhyaksh ke chunaav main ho rahi deree se judaa sawaal poocha to sindhiya ne kaha ki ye sawaal congress se poochna chahie ki pradesh adhyaksh pad ke liye deree kyon ho rahi he? sindhiya ne kaha ki main janata kii seva, pragati or vikaas ko lekar kaam karata hum

 ) anshan kaa jawaab anshan se hi dene kii taiyaari he
 On the lines of Modi, Congress leader Shankar Singh Vaghela is also on a three-day fast
 waghela kaa anshan modi ke anshan se ek ghante pehle shuru ho gaya
 Vaghela's fast is on the road in front of the Sabarmati Ashram
 waghela or modi kaa anshan ek duusare se 8 kilometre dur ho rahaa he, lekin anshan ke pehle hi congress ne modi par hamale tej kar die hai
 Vaghela says that Modi's fast is a political hypocrisy
 gujarat main ho rahi upwas kii raajnneeti phayda kab kise or kitna miltaa he, ye to vakt batayega, lekin itnaa to tay he ki agle teen dinon tak gujarat kii raajnneeti bhukhi rahakar takat aajamaayegi
 After the Armed Forces Tribunal blamed a top officer for messing up reports of the Kargil conflict and being prejudiced against a brigadier, the Army today said it would analyze the verdict and take appropriate action in this regard
 sena ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘ hamen abhi nyaayaadhikaran ke faisle kii prati nahin mili he
 On receipt of the copy of the judgment, it will be analyzed and appropriate steps will be taken
 ’’ nyaayaadhikaran kii pradhan shakha ne apane faisle main kaha he ki tatkaaleen general afisar commanding (jiosi) le
 General Kishan Pal was prejudiced against Brigadier Devinder Singh, a former commander of 70 Infantry Brigade
 saath hi unhone purvaagrah se grast hokar na keval us brigadier kii uplabdhiyon ko kamatar kar aanka balki yuddh kaa galat vivaran bhi diya
 The tribunal has directed the Army that Singh's symbolic promotion to the post of Major General should be considered
 raging ke liye har saal sarkaar kii taraf se guidelins banate hai, jari hote hai, lekin iske baad bhi har saal raging kaa koi na koi aisa maamla aata he jo sabko chaunkaa detaa he
 Stringent laws are put in place to prevent ragging
 Children should be given good education at home, discipline should be taught
 haal hi main sindhiya skool main raging ke haadase ne sabko ek baar phir is pareshaani kii yaad dilaa di he
 While we all know that ragging is a means of increasing the acquaintance of senior students in college, but no one knows when this ragging took such a dangerous form
 chaatr khud bhi ye karte vakt nahin sochate ki raging ke oche or ghatiya tareekon se unki izzat dusron ke saamne ghatati hi he or is tarah se nai dosti kii shuruyaat bhi nahin hoti he
 Who does cruel ragging? If noticed, ragging is the person who has been a victim of it at some time
 us samay kaa gussa wo shaks jab khud ko mauka miltaa he tab nikaalata he
 Apart from this, an average person does this to attract the attention of others, that too in a place like college where everyone is competing to get better
 kuch aise chaatr hote hai jo apane pahanaave se dusron ko aakarshith karte hai, kuch khel main achche hote hai, kuch kii ruchi kala main hoti he or unki kala se sab unhen pahachaanate hai to kuch padhai main bahut achche hote hai
 Among them, there are some students who have no skill and neither do they want to do anything good or learn, only such students do this kind of action to attract the attention of people
 in logon ko khatarnaak majaak kabhi-kabhi kisi kii jaan par ban aati he
 Purpose of becoming a superior Becoming good starts at home
 tallent kii kami, acchhee aadaton kii kami se vyaktitv kamjor hota chalaa jaataa he, isse insaan na sirf khud ko kamjor mahasoos karata he balki dusron ke saamne bhi kamjor banakar hi pesh hota he
 Lack of confidence leads to many more flaws in it
 ek kamjor insaan apni kamiyon ko chupaane ke liye yaa khud ko us kami ke saath santusht karne ke liye dusron kii garima kaa ulanghan karata he
 He feels his success by harassing, abusing, teasing others and in this case he feels small and weak in front
 agar kisi ke andar skill kii kami he to use anya or sakaaratmak tareekon se bhi dur kiya ja saktaa he
 Often in children, the child sees the father reprimanding the mother, and such abuse in the house also affects the child
 to ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki raging kii shuruyaat bachche ghar se hi sikhte hai
 Apart from this, the base of ragging is also made from violent video games, cartoons
 abhibhavakon kii bhoomikabacchon ke anushaasan main abhibhavakon kii bhoomika bahut ahm hoti he
 It is the job of parents to craft their talent, to lead them to learn something new
 jab bachche apni hobbi main vyast hote hai, nai-nai chijen sikhte hai to unhen ek santushti hoti he
 When children are positively content with themselves, they do not have to follow the wrong path
 abhibhavakon ko bachapan se hi skool, sosayadi main bacchon kii gatividhiyon main najar rakhni chahie or choti galati bhi nazarandaaj nahin karnaa chahie
 Children who are victims of bullying are infested with inferiority complex and this inferiority complex is instilled in them from childhood which does not leave them until they grow up

 com / Home Minister p Chidambaram on Tuesday ruled out military actions as the only option for dealing with the Maoist problem and said not doing so is a 'morality dare'
 chidambaram ne kaha ki srilanka ne beshak littey se nibatane ke liye sena kaa istemaal kiya ho, lekin bharat aisa nahin kar saktaa
 We cannot try to do this in India
 chidambaram ne maovadi samasya ko desh kii aatanrik suraksha ke samaksh teen bade khataron main se ek bataate hue yah baat kahi
 The Home Minister said that we may be capable, but we cannot do this
 unhone jehadi tatwon kii aatanki dhamkiyon kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha ki seemaa paar se aatankwaad ke pakistan se pryojit hone kii dharna ko phir se paribhaashit kiye jane kii jarurat he kyonki aatankwaadi pashchim asia se bhi prerana le rahe hai
 Chidambaram said in a book release program, "these (jihadi terrorists) are not just in Pakistan located across the border, but they are as far as West Asia
" hamen seemaa paar se aatankwaad ke matlab ko phir se paribhaashit karne kii jarurat he
 He said that insurgency is the third threat to internal security in the Northeast but it is under control
 unhone kaha ki purvottar ke rajyon main ugravad or madhya bharat ke rajyon main maovadi samasya kaa muqabla karne, ise kaabo karne or is samasya kaa hal karne kaa bharat ke paas saadhan he lekin dharmik aatankwaad kabhi bhi kaabo nahin hoga
 Chidambaram said that the problem of Naxalism is under control, but the government is still discussing how to stop it
 unhone kaha, ‘yah ek acchhee charchaa he
 At the end of it, we will choose a path
 ummid he ki ham ek sahi raah dhund lenge
 ' yah july maah kaa ek din tha
 Hot, sultry and restless
 jab har koi sukun dene vaale wyk-and kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha, tabhi ek haadasa ho gaya
 Earthmover, the giant pit-digging machine of the company engaged in the construction of the digha-aiims road in the capital Patna, accidentally damaged thick electrical cables
 in cabalon ke jariye 220 / 132 / 33 kevi ke khagul grid sab-stesan se digha grid ko bijli pahunchaai jaati he
 This power line supplies electricity to more than 2,00,000 consumers in West Patna
 cabalon ke tuutane se puraa pashchimi patna andhere main dub gaya
 People felt that this trouble is not going to end before a week
 pichley anubhavon ko dekhte hue isse bhi zyada samay lagane kii ummid kii ja rahi thi
 The 132 KV Khagaul cable was broken twice on 2 December 2013 and 30 March 2014
 donon hi baar cabel kii marammat karne main hafte bhar se zyada samay laga tha
 Both times the power had to be cut in the affected areas and supplies in turn
 us samay itani hi bijli mil paa rahi thi ki bijli ke upkaran kisi tarah kaam ke laayak bane rah saken
 Consumers were deprived of the pleasure of electricity
 logon ko kahin se ummid kii kiran nahin dikh rahi thi
 But the 1991 batch IAS officer, Supriya Amrit, who took over as the Energy Secretary a month ago, had nothing to do with the previous records
 unhone visheshgyon or aadhunik cabalon ko jodgaye vaale upkarnon kaa intjaar karne kii jagah koi nayaa upaay aajamaane kaa faisla kiya
 They were successful in this effort and the power was restored within just 36 hours
 us vakt tak madhya pradesh ke satna se cabel visheshgy pahunch bhi nahin paae the
 How did they do it all? apane ejiniyaron ke saath soch-vichaar karne ke baad amrit ne ejiniyaron se kaha ki ve digha grid ko bijli kii supplai karne ke liye kshatigrast cabel se ek asthaayee line sthapit karen
 Electricity is supplied to most areas of western Patna from the Digha grid itself
 jameen khodne vaali mashin arthmuval ne cabel ko kshatigrast kar diya tha, lekin baariki se jaanch karne par paaya gaya ki ek circuit ke do cabel or duusare circuit kaa ek cabel ab bhi sahi-salaamat tha
 Amrit asked the engineers to construct an alternate circuit using these three cables and restore the power to the Digha grid
 yah kaaphi mushkil or khatarnaak kaam tha
 If this experiment was unsuccessful, the situation could have worsened further
 lekin unki koshish kaam kar gai
 On the other hand, the estimate of seven days for cable repair proved to be correct
 cabel kii marammat kaa kaam puraa hone ke liye aath cabel-joint kit kii jarurat hoti he, jinhen sweden se mangana padaa or ve teen din baad hi patna pahunch paae
 It took more than a week to repair the cable
 par upabhoktaaon ko musiibat nahin jhelni padi, kyonki amrit kii koshishon se taiyaar vaikalpik circuit se unhen baraabar bijli milti rahi
 The specialty of Amrit, who received the Prime Minister's Excellence Award for Civil Administration, is that he fulfills the work that is expected of him
 lekin ve yaheen thamane vaale shaks nahin hai
 They carry out their work beyond expectations
 apni lagan, nishtha or saahas ke saath ve is baat kii misaal hai ki naukarshah ko janaseva ke prati kitna samarpit hona chahie
 Amrit is credited for changing the appearance of roads in Bihar
 yahi vajah he ki unhen bijli kshetra main bhi safalataa kii kahani likhane kii jimmedaari di gai he
 With the reins of this working officer in hand, people can expect better power situation

 My darling baby @arhamhussein made his debut on SIT! a little something that people don't know about the shoot
 
 
 we shot for full 12 hours, out of which this little star came on set for all of 5 minutes, and gave us 20 different reactions to insert! Then i took him away to his room, where he slept like a baby (er
 
 he IS a baby after all 😛)
 It was almost as though he knew that mom and dad are shooting today and he should stay calm on the sets
 He felt uncannily home on a shooting set
 Well thank GOD for that, since just a day before he had cried all day due to colic and we got such a scare that we almost called off the shoot! Since both Mohit & me did not feel like leaving him or taking him along if he felt uncomfortable
 So thank you little Arham for allowing my transition back to shoot to be smooth

 i was shooting for The Family Vacation in Kasauli when i was 2 months pregnant
 Nobody knew, since i hadn't announced, but i was feeling all the discomfort, nausea, irritability, back ache, tiredness, sleepiness
 
 and the constant urge to pee
 
 and only he was there to bear that with me
 Secretly, silently, we both started bonded right from then on
 And his silent bonding with @shittyideastrending also started from then on
 This was clicked on the first day i resumed office, and calmly he stared at the logo, as if having his own secret conversation with it, safely, securely protected in dad @mohithussein 's arms
 i beam with pride today when he makes his debut on SIT today at 2

 montek singh ahaluwalia ne kaha ki sidhe-sidhe aam janata se judi sarkari yojanaon or sevaaon main nijee kshetra kii bhagidaari badhani chahie
 Referring to other government schemes including MNREGA, Montek said that due to irregularities, the needy are not benefited, but because of this, the schemes cannot be questioned
 ayog ke upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki endie sarkaar ne saal 2004 main hi petrol par di jane vaali sabsidi khatm karne kii koshish kii thi
 After that UPA had to struggle for 10 years to implement this scheme

 It is unique to release the election manifesto in installments on behalf of a party
 punjab vidhansabha chunaav ke liye aam aadmi party (AAP) ne shuukravaar ko saatvaan chunaav ghoshnaptr jari kiya
 This manifesto seems more or less a threat to the promises made by the Congress, BJP and the Shiromani Akali Dal
 dilachasp yah he ki AAP pehle congress par apane ghoshnaptr kii nakal karne kaa aarope laga chuki he
 But in reality the AAP itself has copied the election manifestos of its rival parties, including the Congress
 AAP ne muft laptop baantne kaa idia akali dal ke chunaav ghoshnaptr se udaaya he
 The only change is that the Akali Dal has promised to give free laptops to the students of class 12, while the AAP has promised to give laptops to students above class ninth in government schools
 akali dal ne plus 2 ke chaatro ko data cord dene kaa bhi vaada kiya he
 So at the same time the Congress has said to give smartphones to 50 lakh unemployed youth in its manifesto
 AAP ne gaavon main jo wifai dene kaa vaada kiya he, wo bhi pehali baar nahin kiya gaya he
 The Akali Dal has already made this promise in its election manifesto
 captain ne AAP ko bataaya 'copy-cat'congress se captain amarinder singh ne ghoshnapatron ko copy karne ke liye AAP par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Captain Amarinder said, it seems strange that he did not even make any attempt to hide his theft
 AAP ne bas hamaare vichaaron ko copy paste kiya he
 i am confident that the AAP election manifesto will meet the same fate as it promised to provide free wifi before the elections in Delhi
 akaliyon kii 'aataa-daal' yojana ke sabhi himachativahin AAP ke punjab prabharee sanjay singh ne ghoshnaptr jari karte hue kaha ki unki party akali dal kii ore se shuru kii gai 'aataa-daal' yojana ko jari rakhegi
 The AAP neither indicated to change the name of the scheme nor said to add any other food item to it
 congress or AAP, donon hi is loklubhaavan sabsidi vaali yojana ko jari rakhane ke paksh main he, jisane akali dal ko 2012 main laabh diya tha, khaas taur par malwa kshetra main
 While the Congress has added tea leaves to the scheme, the Akali Dal has also promised to extend the scope of this subsidized scheme to rice and sugar
 congress ne apane chunavi ghoshnaptr main puure rajya main garibon ke liye 5 rupee main khaanaa uplabdh karaane kaa vaada kiya he
 According to the party, this food will be made available from 'public Kitchens'
 is vaade ko AAP ne shuukravaar ko jyon kaa tyon apane ghoshnaptr main jagah di
 AAP and Akali copied the Congress pension scheme, in addition to this, AAP has also copied the idea of social security pension
 pehle congress ne 1500 rupee prati maheenaa dene kaa vaada kiya
 The Akali Dal in its election manifesto promised to increase this pension to Rs 2000 per month
 ab AAP ne apane ghoshnaptr main 2500 rupee prati maheenaa dene kaa vaada kiya he
 In Punjab, a pension of Rs 500 per month is given for widows and old age
 congress ne apane ghoshnaptr main patrakaron ko bhi har maheene pension dene kaa vaada kiya
 In the same episode, AAP on Friday promised journalists free access to pension and toll plazas
 rajya main sabase pehle congress ne vakeelon ke liye chambar dene kaa vaada kiya
 Taking a break from here, the AAP also made this promise in their election manifesto
 saath main ye bhi jod diya ki nae vakeelon ko 5000 rupee prati maheenaa aarthik sahaayta di jaaegi
 The Congress, in its election manifesto, promised to create NRI interface centers and bring Lokpal for quick disposal of NRI problems
 vahiin AAP ne apane ghoshnaptr main vaada kiya ki jin enarai kii jameenon par avaidh kabje hai unhen 15 din main hi hataa diya jayega
 Apart from this, the AAP promised free health checkup and medical test facilities in Punjab on the lines of Delhi's Mohalla Clinics
 yahaan congress or bijepi ne har ghar main ek rojgaar dene kaa vaada kiya
 While the Akali Dal talked about creating 20 lakh jobs, the AAP promised to increase it to create 25 lakh jobs
 daliton ko lubhaane kii koshish main sabhiaabadi ke anupaat ke hisaab se punjab main desh ke sabhi rajyon se zyada dalit voters hai
 The AAP has promised to form the Deputy Chief Minister from the Dalit community after winning elections in Punjab
 saath hi dalit samudaay ke logon kii utpeedan kii shikayaton kii jaanch ke liye ayog banane kaa bhi vaada kiya he
 The Congress and the Akali Dal have said in their election manifestos to give houses and plots to the Dalits
 iske alaava bijepi ne aatankwaad se prabhavit har parivaar ko 5 lakh rupee dene kaa vaada kiya he
 At the same time, AAP has said to give Rs 5 lakh to every family affected by the 1984 riots
 AAP ke punjab prabharee sanjay singh ne kaha, 'hamane jo bhi vaada kiya he vah hakeekat main badalegaa
 We will eliminate transport, cable and sand mafia, which are choking the bulk of the state's revenue
 congress kii ore se har ghar ko job dene kaa vaada kabhi hakeekat main nahin badal sakaa
 The Akali Dal has also repeated the promises which it could not fulfill even in two consecutive terms

 unke baad brendan makkulam (9922 ran), kirone pollard (9222 ran), shoeb malik (8701 ran) or david warner (8561 ran) kaa number aata he

 David Warner (sunrisers Hyderabad) - 122 innings, 4464 runs, 4 centuries, 41 fifties aasthaa andhi hoti he, bhakthi sirf bhavanaaen dekhati he or bhakton kii yahi andhashraddha he jo pehle insaan ko baba or phir use bhagwaan bana detii he
 In front of blind devotees, Baba makes such an aura that the power of those who follow him to understand and decide the good and bad goes on
 dhire-dhire baba se bhagwaan bane insaan andhabhakton ko apane ishaaron par aise nachaate hai, maano wo jite jaagate manushya na hon, balki ungaliyon par naachne vaali kathputli hon
 But when this illusion of the aura breaks, Gurmeet Ram Rahim comes out of Baba's shell, because he has become so drugged in the costume of God because of his so-called powers, that the person does not consider the human being and the creation according to himself The illusion of running from it prevails
 isiilie ab bhakton kii bhakthi baba se hatakar bhagwaan par laut rahi he
 Now, the devotees understand that God is only one, then what is the need of Babas
 kyonki na gurmeet ram rahim pehla baba he or na hi aakhri hoga, jisane apane mayajaal main logon ko aisa fansaaya ki anuyaayi se log andh bhakt ban gaye, lekin ram rahim ke cond ne duusare dharmaguruon ke kaan jarur khadey kar diye hai
 That is because now on hearing the name Baba, the devotional antenna of the devotees is also starting to stand up
 ram rahim kii karatuuton ne dharm karm main bharosa rakhane vaale logon ko andar tak hilaa diya he
 Now they are neither ready to trust Baba nor their miracles
 suniye jab hamane bhakton se ram rahim kaa naam lekar baabaaon par bharosa karne vaala sawaal daaga to bhakton ke dil kii baat kin shabdon main jubaan par aayi
 Monika, who came to visit the Kalkaji temple, says why trust the Kibabas when you have a direct connection to God
 mandir aaie vahiin bhagwaan mil jaaenge, nahin to sachche dil se yaad karo bhagwaan jarur sunenge
 Anand Dubey is rejecting the existence of Babas
 dube ke mutabik baba ke paas koi chadi nahin hoti
 They are also human like us
 lekin apane aapako bhagwaan bataane par tule hue hai
 When Satish Kumar reached the temple with the whole family, he said that Baba is an illusion
 bhakthi kii shakti dekhni he, to bhagwaan se dil lagaaie lekin log baabaaon ke peeche pagal hai
 His wife also melodies in tune
 kahati hai ki baba par andhbhakti lutaaney kaa anjaam ram rahim ke cese main dekh liya
 Now people too and so-called babas should also be careful
 bhakton kii ankhen fori taur par khuli hai yaa phir unhen koi nayaa baba apanemayavi sansar kaa chamatkaradikhaakar phir apane bas kar legaa, ye to kahana mushkil he, lekin haa gurmeet ram rahim kii karatuuton kaa kam se kam itnaa asar to hona hi chahie ki dharmaguru kam se kam dharm ke mutabik hi karm karen or gurmeet ke sabak ko jarur yaad rakhen

 Earlier, reacting to Afridi's statement, Kohli said, 'as an Indian you always say what is in the interest of the country
 mere hit hameshaa mere desh ke phaayde main nihit hai
 If anyone opposes it, i certainly will not support it
 vaise, kisi khaas mudde par koi baat kahana kisi kii nijee raay ho sakati he

 Good for the body
 Fermented foodcavita Devgan completely agrees with this Anil Kapoor lifestyle
 unke anusaar sara raaj fermentation main hi chipa he
 He told that fermentation happens in every South Indian food, which is considered beneficial for health
 diatician ke mutabik duusare food items ke mukaable fermented food khaane se 3 tareeke ke zyada laabh hote hai
 First, it is easily digested
 south indian food khaanaa body main aasaani se diguest ho jaataa he
 Second, fermented food is highly nutritional
 aisa isiliye he kyonki fermentation ke dauraan khaane kaa nutrishan bad jaataa he
 In addition, good bacteria enter the body
 nutrishan level badhane se hamaare body main zyada nutrishan pahunchataa he
 Third, fermented food is considered good for the intestines
 diatician kavita devgan kaa kahana he ki niyamit rup se south indian khaanaa khaane se puraa sharir swasth rahata he
 However, most food items in North India are not fortified
 yahaan ke log roti or ubili daal khate hai jinamein fermented food jaise phaayde nahin hote hai
 The special thing about South Indian Quizin is not just Fermentation
 fermented food ko nariyal ke tel main pakaaya jaataa he jo isaki khaasiyat ko or badha detaa he
 Kavita says that healthy body, good skin and good hair are the product of South Indian food
 iskaa na sirf aantarik balki bahari asar bhi body par dikhataa he
 Also, do not forget to drink coconut water

 Dietician Shalini Singhal, a source of better protein, also told how South Indian food is the reason for Anil Kapoor's youthful appearance
 south indian khaane ke phaayde bataate hue diatician ne kaha ki inamen bharpoor probiotic paaya jaataa he
 Especially in idli, dosa and uttam
 fermentation pachanshkti ko behatar karata he, vitamin bi ko badhaata he or immune system ko acha karata he
 Dietician reported that in South Indian food such as idli, dosa, rice-sambar, they are usually made from a mixture of grains and pulses, which increase protein
 anaaj or daal donon main kam protein paae jate hai kyonki inamen amino acid kam hota he
 But mixing these two makes better quality protein
 rasm or sambar jaise food item main lo calories pai jaati he kyonki inamen dher sari subjiyan, daal or dahi mili hote hai
 South Indian food made with coconut and rosewood oil is also considered good for the whole body along with the heart
 south indian food items ke saath aamtaur par chacha liya jaataa he jo pet ko thanda karata he or isamen probiotics, protein, calcium, potacium or vitamin bi 12 bhi paaya jaataa he
 According to Dr
 Singhal, coconut water, coconut milk, unrefined coconut oil and fresh raw coconut will work magic for the skin
 saath hi dahi or chacha skin ko swasth banaata he
 The antioxidants found in their vegetables and spices are essential for the body
 diatician ankitha gupta bhi anil kapur ke diet se puri tarah sahamat hai
 He says that most South Indian foods are fortified which increase the B12 vitamin in food
 bi12 vitamin ke kai phaayde hai
 Stimulates the use of coconut oil, emphasizing the use of coconut oil, Ankita Gupta said that most of the South Indian food is made in coconut oil, which is a major source of MCT (medium chain triglyceride)
 ye body main aasaani se pach jaataa he or isse bal or skin donon achche hote hai
 Explaining the benefits of eating South Indian, she says that "antibiotics, chlorinated water, processed foods and increasing stress are eliminating all the good bacteria in us
" isliye hamaare sharir ko thik rakhane ke liye probiotics kii bahut jarurat he jo fermented food jaise idli, dosa or appam se aasaani se mil sakate hai
 "healthy gut = healthy mind + body, which is seen in the glowing skin
" unki jaankaree ke anusaar, "fermentation vitamin bi-complex, vitamin si or khaastaur se vitamin bi-12 ko badhaata he
 It also produces body-friendly bacteria, which increases the immune system
 dietician ne bataaya ki beemaari ke samay hamen deep frid khaane se bachanaa chahie kyonki isse badahazmi kii shikaayat ho sakati he

 Mamtane said, 'where is democracy? Where is secularism? Why are our country's core values being destroyed? Why were 200 companies of central forces sent to Assam? Every move by the BJP and the RSS is a deliberately destructive and political retaliatory move

Life is beautiful a post shared by Kamya Panjabi (@panjabikamya) on Mar 31, 2018 at 9:14pm PDT The farmer moving from Palwal towards Delhi was watching the reactions received during and after prime time on the Satyagrahis
 twitor or fasebuk par ain in pratikriyaaon kaa saamaajik vishleshan hona chahie
 This shows what is the image of our farmer in different sections
 acha laga ki kaaphi sari pratikriyaayein kisaanon ke samarthan main thim
 People from youth to such sections who do not have any connection with the village farmers of the country wanted to understand the sufferings of these farmers
 kisi bhi desh ke liye isse acchhee baat kya ho sakati he ki madhyamvarg ke bich se kamazor tabake ke liye samarthan kii awaz aane lage
 But in the same amount, such reactions also started coming, which were not surprised to see, but once the mind was definitely upset
 log likh rahe the ki aapkaa daftar bhi kisi kisaan kii zamin par hoga
 If you do not take the land, then what will be made in the air? kya aap apana vetan kisaanon ke liye kam kar denge
 The compensation to these farmers is as low as two
 jo paisa miltaa he wo kha pikar uda dete hai
 Go from Gurgaon to Greater Noida and see how many gulls are being flown with compensation money
 ek ne likhaa ki mujhe sirf naukari chahie
 Ask these farmers how will i get a job if there is no development
 vahi to kisaan puch rahe hai
 How will we live if i take my land sirf muawza hi antim raahat nahin he
 Certainly more compensation is being received from the market rate, but those farmers do not know what to do for ten million
 sabake bas kii baat nahin he ki wo agle din se share market main khilne lage
 Become a player while investing
 yah ek badi samasya he
 Compensation money is really wasted
 kuchhek apwaadon ko chhodkar
 If we talk about compensation, it is not always available everywhere
 puure bharat main uski kahani gudgaanv yaa greater noida jaisi nahin he
 The BJP claims that compensation will be four times the market rate, whereas in the law it has been kept as a range
 rajya sarkarein apane halaat ke aadhaar par do se chaar guna tak kaa muawza de sakati hai
 Haryana and Madhya Pradesh fixed the same rate for the entire state i
e
 urban and rural land would get twice the compensation
 yahi kaaran he ki kisaanon ko sarkaron par jaldi yakeen nahin hota he
 This is an example
 aap aise udhaaharan un dalon kii sarkaron se bhi nikaal sakate hai jo is vakt kisaan hitaishi bani hui hai or centre sarkaar ke bill ke virodh main naare laga rahi hai
 There is no dust wash
 haa yah sahi he ki wo zamana gaya ki kisaanon ko kuch pataa nahin hota tha or unki zamin le lee jaati thi lekin wo zamana abhi bhi nahin aayaa he ki zamin lene kii prakriya paardarshee hui he
 There are many examples that the collectors meet with the companies overnight and prepare a fake public hearing document and the land is acquired
 mujhe ummid thi ki twitor or fasebuk par log kisaanon kii is takalif se sahanubhuti rakhenge
 My question is to those who call farmers as anti-development
 aisa kyon hota he ki har baar kisaan hi lathi khaataa he
 He eats sticks in all the governments
 sab rajyon main lathi khaataa he
 Sugar mills have taken sugarcane at many places but did not pay them for years
 aapane kisi company waalon ko lathi khate dekha he
 Corporates are an essential part of our development, but are such plunderers a symbol of development
 baat vikaas kii nahin ho rahi he baat he barabari or insaaf kii
 Why can't such a system be made where everyone benefits and trust is more than everyone
 aakhir aapane kab dekha he ki korporate ke log dharna dene bason main savaar hokar aate hai
 He gets two sound bytes and a meeting with the Prime Minister
 unki awaz sadak se nahin uthati balki satta ke galiyaaron main gumti hui sattanashin ke kaan tak pahunch jaati he
 i am giving this example so that you can understand the strength of voice and the strength of voice in democracy
 soch kar dekhiyegaa ki kyon kisaanon ko hi sainkadon kilometre paidal chalakar dilli tak aana padataa he
 If these farmers had not come, would all the parties raise such a voice
 kyon akali dal kah rahaa he ki adhigrahan se pehle sahmati or saamaajik asar ke adhyayan kii shart ko waapas joda jaae
 Why Shiv Sena has said that it will not support any decision that throttles farmers
 ye dal tabhi kyon bolte hai jab kisaan bolne ke liye uthta he
 Walks on foot bhukhe sangharsh karata he
 Listen to the recording of any election meeting
 kisi bhi netaa kaa bhaashan sun lijie
 He has been saying that the farmer of our country keeps himself hungry and feeds the nation
 kya kisi netaa ko yah kehete suna he ki hamaare desh kaa karporate khud bhookha rahakar desh kaa pet bharta he
 How can someone who is hungry be opposed to development
 kisaan kaa bhavishya bhi to vikaas main he
 It is another matter that the meaning of development is different for everyone
 agar hamaara kisaan desh ke liye bhookha rah saktaa he to wo desh kii pragati ke kilaaf kaise ho saktaa he
 We also raise the slogan of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan on one side and on the other hand when he talks about his rights, he cares about his stomach and not his stomach
 kam se kam uskaa shukriya to adaa kar hi sakate hai jo khud bhookha rahakar hamaara pet bharta he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ravivaar ko apane cabinet ke vistaar main bhale hi bihar or uttar pradesh par zyada dhyaan diya ho, lekin is vistaar main ek naam 'giriraaj singh' ke shaamil hone se sarkaar kii aalochana ho rahi he
 Political experts believe that by including Giriraj Singh, Narendra Modi has weakened his own statement 'na khaange na na khene denge'
 darasal giriraaj singh ko shaamil kar modi ne un par ehsaan nahin kiya he, balki pichley chaar varshon se giriraaj dwaara modi phens club chalaane ke liye unke karj ko utaara he
 When everyone was afraid to take Modi's name, Giriraj firmly reiterated not only that the ban on Modi should be lifted for campaigning
 balki baad ke dinon main modi pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ho uski vakaalat bina uske parinaam kii chintaa kiye hue chamakar kiya karte the
 And perhaps after becoming Prime Minister, when Modi announced not to include more than 75 years of age in the cabinet, do not be shocked, it is actually done to ease the path of Giriraj's entry in the cabinet
 giriraaj bihar ke bhoomihaar jati se aate hai or us jati se do or diggaj dow
 CP Thakur and Bhola Singh were also in the queue, but both were over 75 years of age
 to aise main pradhanmantri ke is ghoshnaa ke baad giriraaj ke pravesh ko chunauti dene vaala koi nahin bachaa
 But the theft of one crore 14 lakh from Giriraj's house and later his recovery was a noose
 is maamle kii jaanch philhal patna police or iskar vibhaag kar rahi hai
 In this case, a brother of Giriraj then claimed that the money belonged to him, but the officials of Income Tax Department believe that all the arguments made in support of this claim are quite contradictory
 lekin pradhanmantri to pradhanmantri, vittamantri arun jetali ne somvaar ko jab ye kaha ki giriraaj ke khilaaf koi maamla nahin banataa, usase shaayad unhen andaja ho yaa nahin, lekin raajnneetik ke chakkar main inakam tex adhikariyon ke najar main unki chhavi par pratikul asar padegaa
 Because while the investigation is going on, giving a clean chit to Jaitley is like influencing the investigation
 unke bayaan ne iskar vibhaag ke manobal ko or bhi kam kiya he
 Therefore, Giriraj's entry into the cabinet made one thing clear that BJP is not like him apart from other parties, just a difference of degree
 sarkaar ke is kadam ab hindi kshetron main bijepi ke bhrashtachar kaa mudda nishchit rup se kamjor padegaa
 Senior leader of the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh and the state's Public Works and Irrigation Minister Shivpal Yadav said on Wednesday that the park belongs to the people and not to the government and there will be no trees, no trees
 shivpal ne yah baat gomtinagar sthit ambedkar park kaa naam badale jane ke virodh main bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke netaaon dwaara mangalvaar ko die gaye sankethik dharne ke sambandh main kahi
 BSP leaders later submitted a memorandum to the governor
 mantri ne mediakarmiyon se baatcheet main kaha, park janata kaa hota he, kisi sarkaar kaa nahin
 As far as the renaming of the Ambedkar Park is concerned, the previous BSP government did not follow the government rules for naming the park, so the government had to properly rename the park
 shivpal ne kaha ki park kaa namakaran karne se pehle baqayda sarkaar kii ore se gajet jari kiya jaataa he or tab uskaa namakaran hota he lekin basapa sarkaar ne aisa kuch nahin kiya tha
 The comments unhone kaha ki rajya main jo bhi park banaae jate hai, unhen janata ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi banaaya jaataa he
 The state government announced the renaming of the park in the assembly
 shivpal ne kaha ki mayawati kii sarkaar main park kaa naam bina gajet ke hi rakhaa gaya tha, jise sahi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Shivpal said this in connection with the symbolic dharna given by leaders of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Tuesday in protest against the renaming of Ambedkar Park in Gomtinagar
 basapa netaaon ne baad main rajyapal ko ek gyaapan bhi saunpa tha
 The minister told media persons that the park belongs to the public and not to any government
 jahaan tak ambedkar park kaa naam badale jane kii baat he to purvavarti basapa sarkaar ne is park kaa namakaran karne ke liye sarkari niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya tha, lihaaja sarkaar ko sahi tareeke se park kaa namakaran karnaa padaa
 Shivpal said that before naming the park, a gazette is issued by the government and then it is named but the BSP government had not done anything like this
 tippaniyan He said that whatever parks are built in the state are made keeping in mind the public
 rajya sarkaar ne park kaa naam badale jane kii ghoshnaa vidhansabha main kii thi
 Shivpal said that in Mayawati's government the park was named without a gazette, which cannot be justified

 unhone kaha, ‘yah behad asamvedansheel bayaan he
 Do widows have no dignity? kal ko mujhase kaha jaayegaa ki tum vidhwaa ho or dilli chhodkar andhrapradesh laut jaao to main kya karuungi
 To what extent is this behavior justified? ’ unhone kaha, ‘hema ne vidhwaaon kii ummiden todi hai
 As a woman, she could not understand their pain
 vah saansad hai or unhen vidhwaaon ko saamaajik suraksha dilaani chaiye thi

 After this statement of Hemaji, the local administration will create problems for the widows

 Sonal Singh Wadhwa, CEO of Maitri India, an NGO that runs the Maitri Ashram on Radhakund, said that it is necessary to understand the social and cultural conditions of these widows before making such a statement
 unhone kaha, ‘ve apni marji se vrundavan nahin ain, balki parivaar dwaara tyaage jane ke baad kaashi yaa vrundavan main panaah lee he
 This is a very sensitive issue

 His entire focus on this tour will be to first focus on dismissing Virat Kohli
 yah kahana he khud australian cricket team ke captain steve smith kaa
 Australian cricket team captain Steve Smith believes that keeping the home captain Virat Kohli quiet in the upcoming ODI series against India will be a source of success for Australia
 aapako bataa den ki kohli shandaar form main hai
 He was recently the highest run-scorer in a five-match series against Sri Lanka, scoring 330 runs, including two centuries and a half-century
 saare match khel bhaavana se khele jaaengekhel bhaavana ko taak par rakhkar har match jitne ke liye jane jane vaali australia team is baar kah rahi he ki sabhi match khel bhaavana se khele jaaenge

 vah bhi sirf gend yaa balle se nahin balki ishaaron or shabdon se bhi

 In such a situation, Smith has eight ODI centuries to his name, saying that he is not too worried about the comparison between himself and the home captain, but to succeed in this series, he will have to dismiss Kohli cheaply
 yahi nahin australia team nahin chaahegi ki unke purv captain kaa record unheen kii team ke khilaaf toote
 Mistake of confession, Smith told reporters after the practice session, "I am not too worried about this comparison with Kohli
 nishchit rup se vah kaaphi acha khilaadi he or unka vanade ricard laajawab he
 Hopefully we will be able to keep calm as far as possible in this series
 agar ham aisa karte hai to ummid he ki ham is daure main safalataa praapt kar sakate hai
 "australia toured India earlier this year for the Test series, but the Bangalore match was riddled with controversy as Smith admitted that he looked to the dressing room to seek help on the DRS call and called it It was dubbed the 'brain fed' moment
 us samay kohli ne smith par dhokhadhadi karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha lekin mehmaan team ke captain ne vaada kiya ki ab is baar koi vivaad nahin hoga
 Smith said, "I think this game will be played in the spirit
 bharat ke khilaaf khelnaa kathin muqabla hota he
 "the challenge will be met by spinner India has decided to rest their top spinners r Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in the selected squad for the three odis but Smith said that the spin attack of the hosts is still very strong
" unhone kaha, ‘‘yah test cricket kii tulana main kaaphi alag praaroop he

 yujavendra chahal bhi team main hai
 Kuldeep Yadav is also a good bowler
 unke paas nishchit rup se kuch achche spin vikalp hai or puri shrinkhalaa main unka acchhee tarah saamana karnaa hoga
 "I think his one-day team has been playing spin well for some time," Smith said

 Hopefully a handpump will be put in place to quench the thirst of your children
 'yadav ne van vibhaag ke sahyog se chitrakoot ke paas 50 hectare banjar jameen par pichley 10 varshon main lagbhag 40,000 ped lagaae hai
 District Magistrate Seshamani Pandey entrusted Yadav with the responsibility of planting saplings on 50 hectares of forest land, for which he would be given a monthly grant of Rs 4,500
 yadav ne kaha ki ped insaanon ko shuddh hawa dete hai
 It is our responsibility to save them

 rishi dhawan, gurkirat maan, ravindra jadeja, australia ke daure par in teenon khilaadiyon kii bhoomika team main olerounder kii thi, lekin ye teenon hi team india ke kaam nahin aa sake
 Where the Australian all-rounders rocked both the bat and the ball in the ODI series, all three failed in some department
 rishi dhawan ne himachal ke liye to wicket ko ambara lagaaya or balle se bhi ummid jagaate dikhe, lekin apni debyue siries main unki sachai duniya ke saamne aa gai

 In the same number of matches, 12 runs came off Rishi's bat, 12

 Rishi can get a chance in T20 only by luck
 gurkirat maan ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki vah achche ballebaaj or ek aise spinner hai, jo ran roak saken, lekin gurkirat se donon hi kaam nahin ho paae
 Gurkeerat bowled 10 runs in three matches, conceding 6 for 68

 In batting too, he scored 13 runs in 6 matches, 6

 Rishi Dhawan has picked up the wicket for Himachal and has also shown hope with the bat, but in his debut series, his truth came out in front of the world
 rishi ne teen maichon main 25 over kii gendbaazi kii 160 ran die 6
 With an economy rate of 40 and was able to take just one wicket
 itane hi maichon main rishi ke balle se 12 ran nikle, 12
 At an average of 00
 rishi ko tii-20 main mauka bahut hi kismat se hi mil saktaa he
 It is said about Gurkeerat Mann that he is a good batsman and a spinner who can stop runs, but both of them could not work with Gurkeerat
 gurkirat ne teen maichon main 10 over kii gendbaazi kii 68 ran die 6
 He did not get even 1 wicket at an economy rate of 80
he also scored 13 runs in three matches, 6 in the ballebaazi main bhi unhone teen maichon main 13 ran banaae, 6
 At an average of 50
 tippaniyan Jadeja was preferred before Ashwin because he can contribute to the bowling as well as the batting, but Jadeja's fault was that he could not do anything with the bat
 jadeja ne paanch maichon main 48 over kii gendbaaji karke 257 ran die 5
 With an economy of 35 and three wickets in what can be called a fine performance, but he failed to do much in batting, scored 45 runs in five matches, 45

 It is clear that since Kapil Dev, Team India's search for a good all-rounder is still not over and this factor has become the reason for the defeat of Team India many times on foreign tours

 India may have won the third and final Test match against New Zealand by an innings and 198 runs, but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that the team could not play to its full potential in the three-match series
 bhartiya captain ne match ke baad samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘main yah kahana chaahunga ki hamane is test match main apni kshamta kaa keval 60 pratishat hi pradarshan kiya
 There can be any reason for this
 jahaan tak pehle do test match kii baat he to unamem ham apni kshamta kaa 40 pratishat hi pradarshan kar paye
 Dhoni, however, defended Suresh Raina, who was in poor form, and said that he was mentally tired due to excessive cricket in the last six months
 unhone kaha, ‘raina lambey samay se lagaataar khel rahaa he
 i had even taken rest in the Zimbabwe tour but had played there
 saubhaahgya se mujhe ab 10-15 din kaa vishram mil rahaa he jisase mujhe tarotaaja hokar dakshin africa shrinkhalaa kii taiyaari main madad milegi
 "dhoni defended Raina, who scored only 26 runs in four innings," but he has not rested in the first two matches against the New Zealand series
 kabhi apana shat pratishat nahin dene kaa shaareerik ke alaava maansik kaaran bhi hote hai
 'he said,' i cannot answer this
 behatar yahi hoga ki aap bisisiai se pucho
 i can only hope that he gets rest in the last three odis
 vah hamaari ballebaaji line ap kaa mahatvapurn khilaadi he or hamaara mukhya kshetrarakshak bhi he
 So when you play continuously, mental fatigue prevails over you
 uske liye vishram jaruri he
 Dhoni praised Man of the Match Rahul Dravid and Ishant Sharma who took seven wickets
 unhone kaha, ‘nishchit taur par yah sakaaratmak he ki ishanth ne acchhee gendbaaji kii
 If more of your bowlers perform well then you will have more options
 isi tarah se ballebaaji main rahul or sachin ke kaaran madhyakram main sthirataa he
 Dhoni said, "rahul is an important player in our lineup because when Veeru gives you a brisk start, a player like him is needed
 isse aage ke ballebaajon ko bhi madad milti he
 He described the pitch as a traditional Indian wicket which was dry and the ball was getting a turn
 dhoni ne halke phulke andaaj main kaha ki unhen dopaher ke bajaay shaam ko media kaa saamana karne kii ummid thi
 He said, 'I thought i would meet you guys in the evening not so soon
 iske liye puraa shrey gendbaajon ko jaataa he
 Our strategy yesterday was to bat an extra hour so that we don't have to do too many overs in the evening
 ’ dhoni ne kaha, ‘isse hamen gend ko kadaa rakhane main madad mili or isse tej gendbaajon or spinneron ko bhi madad mili jo isse oochaal hasil kar sakate the
 Raina also took a few wickets
 mujhe khushi he ki ishanth ne tej or sahi kshetra main gendbaaji kii
 'some decisions in the Test series were not right, but the Indian captain still believes that the referral system is not completely full proof
 unhone kaha, ‘jab tak mujhe nahin lagata ki yah pranali shat pratishat sahi he tab tak main uskaa paksh nahin luungaa
 Instead i would suggest the use of a system like hot spot
 gendbaajon ke anukool paristhitiyon main kuch galat faisle chalate hai lekin yadi aap sapaat pich par khel rahe hon to do yaa teen galat faislon kaa matlab he ki aapako 40-50 over adhik karne honge

 ) film 'total siyapa' kii kahani gumti he landan main based hue ek pakistani ladke or vahiin rah rahi ek hindustani ladki ke pyaar ke ird-gird, jahaan aashaa kaa kirdaar nibhaa raheen yami gautam apane bwoyfriend aman, yani ali zafar ko apane ghar laati hai apane parivaar se milwane ke liye
 
 
 Just after this entry in Aman's house of hope, 'siapa' starts
 
 
 vaise, aapaki jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki 'siyapa' ek punjabi shabd he, jiskaa arth hota he 'ronaa-peetna' or 'bahut badi gadabad'
 
 
 In this film, it is taken in the context of 'very big mess'
 
 
 aashaa kaa parivaar us pakistani ladke ko apane damaad ke rup main nahin sweekaarta
 
 
 'total Siapa' is based on a serious subject like cross-border lovestory, but has been given the form of comedy
 
 
 ham 'total siyapa' ke promo dekhakar badi ummid baandhakar theatre pahunche the, or hamaari dilchaspee yah jaanane main thi ki ek hindustani ladki apane parivaar se jab pakistani bwoyfriend ko milwaayegi, to kisi banegi sichuation or kaisaa hoga 'siyapa', lekin ye riection chand hi drishyon main khatm ho gaye
 
 
 After this, the entire film revolved around here and there, many reasons kept coming and going
 
 
 ek vakt ke baad aisa lagane laga ki kahani ko aage badhaane ke liye drishyon ko jabaran daalaa gaya he
 
 
 The director could not use a good actor like Anupam Kher in the film
 
 
 haalanki kiran kher, ali zafar or yami gautam ne acha abhinay kiya he, magar sabhi kamazor kahani ke shikaar banakar rah gaye
 
 
 If you have seen the promos of 'total Siapa', and you have laughed at them, then i would like to mention that in addition to the scenes seen in the promo, only one or two funny scenes can be found in 'total Siapa'
 
 
 film ko kamedi kii tarah darshakon ke saamne parosa zarur gaya he, lekin na isamen kamedi he, na hi romance
 
 
 So, my rating for this film is - 1
 5 star
 
 
 Major issues such as ambush, infiltration, unauthorized entry into the Rann of Kutch, smuggling and ceasefire violations in Jammu and Kashmir are likely to figure in the five-day director-general level talks with Pakistan

 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar, udyaan prabandhan ne baaghon se suraksha ke liye 40 se zyada charavaahon or graminon ko helmet baant die hai

 bandhavgarh udyaan kshetra ke gramin bhi is baat ko nahin samaj paa rahe hai ki kya helmet unki jaan kii raksha kar paaegaa
 Not only this, they are also questioning what management wants
 tippaniyan Wildlife activist Ajay Dubey has said that "this will probably be the first such case in the world of wildlife, when the garden management itself is encouraging the villagers to enter the danger zone
" sawaal uthta he ki kya baagh sirf sir or seene par hi hamalaa karata he
 This decision of management is without any scientific test and unreasonable
 ' Dubey further says that the garden management should take the step that such a situation is not created so that the tiger and humans face it, but it is working to push the villagers to the point where it is difficult to escape the villagers or the shepherds

 congress ke netritv main mahagathbandhan kya 2019 main narendra modi kii kaddavar shakhsiyat ko chunauti de saktaa he? desh bhar main ekajute ho rahaa vipaksh kya loksabhaa chunaavon main endie ko haraa saktaa he? aisa karnataka main dikhaa jahaan sonia gandhi ne janata dal (secular) ko aage karke uske saath chunaav baad gathbandhan kar bhaajapa ke netritv vaale endie kaa pasa palat kar rakh diya
 At the same time, in three important by-elections in Uttar Pradesh, the opposition defeated the BJP and surprised them
 ye donon sawaal aapas main jude hue hai, lekin alag bhi hai
 The first question indicates that there will be Modi versus others in the 2019 general election; At the same time, it says that it will be a war of two Grand Alliance - UPA + vs NDA +
 pehle sawaal kaa jawaab pradhanmantri kii shakhsiyat par nirbhar he or yah chunavi mahaasangram kii ruparekha tay karegaa
 At the same time, the second question will come up according to the addition and subtraction of alliances
 isi tarah, pehla paridrishy jahaan 2014 ke modi banaam rahul kii chunavi ladaai ko dikhaa rahaa he, vahiin, doosraa ateet main mahagathbandhanon ke bich hui do mahatvapurn jang ko pradarshit kar rahaa he, jab 1999 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaala endie vijayi hua tha, to 2004 main sonia gandhi kii aguai vaala upie
 If there is a war of figures in the 2019 elections, then Rahul or any leader of the UPA will be dwarfed by Modi like the presidential election
 2014 main aisa hi dikhaa tha jab upie gathbandhan ne jaan-boojhkar bahes ko yah kehete hue badalane kii koshish kii thi ki pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke naam ko loksabhaa chunaav khatm hone ke baad tay kiya jayega
 The clash between about half a dozen leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Mamta Banerjee, Mayawati, Chandrababu Naidu, Sharad Pawar and Akhilesh Yadav stops by fighting the war without declaring the name of the general
 darasal ye sabhi pradhanmantri pad kii ichha rakhte hai
 When the UPA was forging alliances with all parties, big and small and trying to convert the war of figures into manipulation of figures, the NDA had quietly found new allies in the states — Naveen Patnaik-led Biju From Janata Dal (BJD) to K
 chandrashekhar raav kii telugana raashtra samiti (tiares), vaai
 s
 jaganmohan reddy kii viesar congress or eiediemke
 Apart from this, now BJP has also included angry allies like Janata Dal (united) in its court
 yah pichley hafte rajyasabha ke up-sabhapati ke chunaav main dikhaa, jab jad (you) ke harivansh narayan singh is pad par chune gaye
 Four new allies supported Harivansh in this election
 haalanki endie ko modi kii shakhsiyat kii vajah se badhat mili hui he, iske baavjood vah upie-virdohi chote-chote kshetreey dalon ke saath gathbandhan taiyaar kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, which of the two Grand Alliance has more power to win the 2019 riots? Until a while ago, the challenge of the NDA from the UPA seemed like a mirage in the desert
 lekin karnataka ke nateezon ne upie ke netritv main ban rahe mahagathbandhan ko ahm shakl de di he, jo endie ke liye gambhir chunauti ban sakati he
 However, the NDA is forging alliances with parties of various ideologies to curb the anti-incumbency after four years of rule
 par hawa kaa rukh kya hoga?donon gathbandhanon ke netaaon ke haalia daavon ko dekhen
 Prime Minister Modi has recently rejected the anti-bjp grand alliance
 unhone ek saakshaatkaar main kaha, "hataash or bhinn samoohon kaa vichaardhaara viheen yah gathbandhan mahagathbandhan nahin, balki rajnatik dussahas he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi hopes that his personality will play an important role in preparing a grand alliance under the leadership of UPA
 unhone june main mumbai main kaha tha, "yah bhaajapa kaa virodh karne vaale rajnatik dalon kaa hi nahin, balki logon kaa bhi maananaa he ki aisa mahagathbandhan taiyaar ho jo pradhanmantri, bhaajapa or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa muqabla kar sake
 "union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi gave a befitting reply to Rahul, calling the anti-bjp coalition" band without band, Baja, Baaraat "
 yah tanj sidhe rahul par ksaa gaya tha jinka aksar virodhiyon kii ore se pradhanmantri ke pad ke liye "anupyukt'' or bhaajapa ke shabdon main "pappu'' kah kar majaak udaaya jaataa he
 Current Scenario India today-karvy Insights has conducted a nationwide mood survey about seven months before the Lok Sabha elections, which presents three possible scenarios
 jaahir he, teenon paridrishy kaalpanik hai kyonki pichley chaar varshon ke dauraan donon gathbandhanon kii shakl kaaphi badal chuki he
 These scenarios are based on arithmetic estimates of possible pre-election alliances in various states
 paridrishy 1-upie or endie ke sahyogiyon ko 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii sthiti ke anusaar rakhaa gaya he
 In this, both the rivals have been tested on the basis of the exercise to increase their respective powers in view of the coming 2019 elections
 ye rujhaan pichley desh kaa mizaaj survey ko aage badhaate hai
 Except the three largest allies, Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Trinamool Congress (TMC), the UPA is projected to get 122 seats (20 seats higher than the country's mood survey of January 2018)
 
 survey ke mutabik, endie ke khate main 281 or anya ke khate main 140 siten aane kaa anumaan he
 Both rival alliances have a 5 percent vote share - 36 percent for the NDA and 31 percent for the UPA and 33 percent for the others
 congress ke akele 83 or bhaajapa ke 245 or anya ke 215 siten paane kii sambhaavna jataai gai he
 Scenario 2-UPA +, in which SP, BSP and Trinamool Congress form a pre-poll alliance, are likely to perform much better
 tab inke paas endie se mahaj 4 kam or kul 224 seat aane kii sambhaavna he
 In that case, others will get 91 seats
 vot pratishat kii baat karen to upie+ (41 fisadi) kaa pradarshan endie (36 fisadi) se behatar rahegaa or anya 23 fisadi vot paane main safal rahenge
 The question arises that despite the high vote percentage in this situation, why would UPA get less seats than NDA +? This is because the BJP has a higher strike rate than the Congress
 congress kaa vot puure desh main bikharaa hua he jabaki bhaajapa kaa vot khaas kshetron jaise uttar, pashchim or uttar-purv main kendrit he
 As a result, despite the tough competition between UPA Plus and NDA Plus, the Congress may have to settle for only 96 seats while the BJP will get 194 seats
 apane teen bade sahyogiyon kii badaulat do ahm rajyon—uttar pradesh (80 loksabhaa seat) or pashchim bengal (42 loksabhaa seat)—main upie ko baari badhat mil sakegi
 After winning the by-elections in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana this year, there have been several rounds of talks between the SP and BSP for the pre-poll alliance and the Congress has become a junior player
 paridrishy 3-endie+ ke kheme main dakshin se nae saathi shaamil hote haih tamilnadu main eiediemke, andhra pradesh main viesar congress
 The Telugu Desam Party and the Peoples Democratic Party, which had left the NDA, have been included in the UPA camp
 dakshin main nae saathiyon kii badaulat endie+ ke 255 seat paane kii sambhaavna he jabaki upie+ ke hisse main 242 siten aaengi
 UPA (43 per cent) is still projected to be 2 points ahead of NDA in terms of popular vote
 vahiin anya ko mahaj 16 pratishat vot milenge
 If the two new partners, the BJD and the TRS, go under the pre-poll alliance with the NDA, the NDA + will get 282 seats and the UPA + will get 242 seats
 chunaav baad kaa sameekaran us dasha main jatil ho jayega agar anya kii shrenee main rakhi gayi sipii or sipiem upie kaa hissaa ban jaati hai
 Nevertheless, NDA + will remain ahead of UPA + in every situation on the basis of seats

 Most importantly, the concept of neo-nationalism and Hindutva will be helpful in keeping thousands of its workers engaged

 49 percent of the people want to see him as Prime Minister while Rahul 27 percent

 An important question is whether the upa's grand alliance will be able to maintain a synergy between Muslim, Dalit and OBC voters by polarizing the mainstream Hindu votebank? Of course, janeudhari-tilakdhari Rahul is going to temples and trying in this regard
 lekin bahut kuch is par nirbhar karegaa ki roodhiwaadee hindu votaron ko naaraaz kiye bagaiyr yah mahagathbandhan endie ke hindutv agenda kaa kitna aakraamak virodh kar paata he
 Moreover, instead of being merely anti-modi, the UPA will have to explain its ideology with full clarity
 sampradayikta banaam dharmanirpekshata kaa jang kha chukaa formula bahusankhyak vot kaa bhaajapa ke paksh main dhruvikaran hi karata he
 Apart from empowering farmers and women, the UPA will have to take a concrete alternative economic approach to development
 vahiin prabhavi chunavi ranneeti or booth prabandhan to apnaanaa hi hoga
 Most importantly, the upa's grand alliance has to show the dream to the public - the dream of a better tomorrow

 From the demand for the removal of AFSPA to the openly angry resentment in the case of Liaquat Shah, your stance towards New Delhi has been steadily increasing? i take the same stand that i feel is not right that it is against Delhi
 meraa matlab he ki liyakat ke maamle main dilli kaise shaamil he? yah kaam dilli police ne kiya, kendriya grih mantralay ne nahin
 But in March, you gave an angry speech in Jammu and Kashmir Assembly and accused Delhi of spying

 mere khyaal main is tarah kii dohari chaal ko durust karne kii jarurat he
 It is such a thing
