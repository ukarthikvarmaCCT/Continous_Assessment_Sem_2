 However, NCP chief Sharad Pawar remains a conundrum for both Shiv Sena and Congress
 unka daawa he ki unke bhattije ajit pavaar ne apane 54 vidhayakon ko bijepi ko dene kaa faisla akele hi kiya

 For this, employment data obtained from EPFO, ESIC, NPS is resorted to
 ye aankade kai baar paraspar virdohi hote hai

 Even if you have cleaned the house before Diwali, there are special benefits on cleaning some special places in the house on the day of Pardhanataras
 aaj ham aapako wo khaas upaay bataaenge, jisaki madad se aapaki aamadani, aapaki dhan daulat or aapaki kismat bhagwaan dhanavantari, kuber dev or maa lakshmi kii kripadrushti paakar chamak uthegi
 Cleaning of the northeast: According to Vastu, the northeast is the most important
 ise devataaon kaa sthaan kehete hai
 So every temple is usually built in this angle
 ghar kaa ishan kone uttar-purv kone ko kehete hai
 This angle must be cleaned on the day of Dhanteras
 kaha jaataa he ki ghar kaa yah kshetra yadi ganda he yaa is jagah par aisi chijen rakhi hai, jinka aap kabhi istemaal hi nahin karte, to aise ghar main maa lakshmi kii krupa nahin hoti
 Therefore, the northwest corner of your house should always be kept clean
 khaastaur se dhanteras ke din is sthaan kii saaf-safai karne se ghar ke vaastu main sudhaar hota he
 Towards the East: On the day of Dhanteras, get up early and clean the places east of the house
 isse ghar main sakaaratmak urja kaa sanchaar hota he

 uttar disha: The Indian football team will play an international friendly against China on Saturday after 21 years in which the home team will be a strong contender for victory despite recent poor form
 bhartiya team china main pehali baar antarrashtriya match khel rahi he, haalanki senior timen beete samay main 17 baar ek duusare se bhid chuki hai
 China played in India seven times, all these matches were held in the invitation tournament Nehru Cup
 bharat ko 17 muqablon main se ek main bhi jeet nahin mili jabaki china ne 12 maukon par fatah hasil kii
 Five matches were drawn
 bharat or china kii senior timen pichhali baar 1997 nehru cap main kochi main ek duusare se bhidin thi jisamen ‘red dragons’ ne 2-1 se jeet darj kii thi
 3 reasons why Prithvi cannot make a batsman like Prithvi, the Indian team has not been able to make a place in a single FIFA World Cup, while China did it in 2002, in which it was eliminated from the group stage after losing all three matches
 vaishvik manch par china kaa itnaa dabadabaa nahin he, lekin asia main vah majboot footbal deshon main shumaar rahaa he
 The team is consistently in the top 10 in Asia and in the top 100 in the world rankings
 abhi china fifa ranking main 76wein or asia main saatven sthaan par kabiz he
 China has played 11 times in the Asian Cup, which is the continent's top tournament and has finished runners-up twice and in third place several times
 vahiin duusari ore bharat asia cap main sirf teen baar (1964 main up vijeta, 1984 or 2011 main) khelaa he or haal main usne lambey samay ke baad fifa ranking main sheersh 100 main jagah banaai
 The country's team is currently ranked 97th in FIFA rankings and 15th in Asia
 world cap tak wicket ke peeche dhoni kii badshahath par muharbharat ke liye china se khelnaa saahasik kadam he, kyonki asian cap yaa vishwa cap qualifire ko chhod den to team haal ke dinon main mahadweep kii sheersh team ke khilaaf nahin kheli he
 The match will be played during the FIFA International Friendship Matches window time between the two teams which is important for the preparations for the AFC Asia Cup in January next year
 isse bharat kii pragati kaa sahi andaja lagegaa
 Indian coach Stephen Constantine said, "we are fully aware that China is a big team in this field
 unki team kaaphi majboot hogi
 They would like to play aggressive football and also keep possession of the ball
 ham is match main jeet ke iraade se utrenge
 But even if we lose, we will still try to find positive aspects
 ’ World Cup cricket was started in 1975 as an experiment to give cricket enthusiasts a lot of fun in the entire tournament
 mujhe nahin lagata ki us samay usamen shaamil tiimon ko andaja bhi tha ki aakhir ve kya shuru kar rahe hai
 It was not that the competition was not tough — there was a thorn event — but all the teams were watching it and enjoying it like a fortnight apart from the bilateral cricket series
 main us samay antarrashtriya cricket kaa nayaa rangarut tha or apane kuch adarsh ballebaajon ke saath team main hone se behad khush tha
 i hardly got a chance to bat in that tournament and became known only for my fielding in the final
 jab maine teen ballebaajon ko ran out kar diya tha
 After winning the title and seeing Clive Lloyd picking up the silver cup in the Lord's balcony, we realize that we have achieved something special
 duusare vishwa cap ke dauraan main bataur ballebaaj apane kariyar ko kuch nikhaar chukaa tha
 i was imagining to play the responsibility as a senior batsman and this time was very excited about showing more jambaji with my bat
 vishwa cap england main hi tha—tab ham to kalpana bhi nahin kar pate the ki yah kahin or ho saktaa he—or mujhe vahaan ke halaat raas aate the
 Also because i used to play county cricket in Somerset in those days
 team bhi kaaphi khil uthi thi or yah mana ja rahaa tha ki ham jahaan bhi jate hai, maidan maar lete hai
 Our batting was not only solid due to batsmen like Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Hanes, Clive Lloyd, Alvin Kalicharan and Collis King, but also great bowling due to the likes of Joel Garner, Michael Holding, Andy Roberts and Colin Craft
 sabase pasandida team hone se khitaab jeet lene kii guarantee nahin ho paati he, isliye hamen ehsaas tha ki hamen maukey par apana damakham dikhaanaa hoga
 We started our campaign with a match with India and got an easy win
 shuruaati match se aakhri match tak do hafte kaa samay tha or hamane shuruyaat acchhee kar lee to hamaara jeet kaa abhiyaan aage badhane laga
 The league matches went smoothly and we reached the semi-finals easily
 semi final tab behad acchhee team pakistan ke saath tha
 She was one of those teams in which bowling attack and batting were also good
 mujhe yaad he ki greenidge or hence kii shatkeey saajhedaari se ham 290 se adhik ranon kii chunauti de paae the
 In those days World Cup matches were of 60 overs but it was difficult to take the total score above 240
 ham test match ke andaaj main hi pari khadi karte the
 Initially, some maidens did not cause anger in the change room
 pakistani team ranon kaa peechha karte hue shuru main score dar score hamaari barabari main chal rahi thi
 Majid Khan and Zaheer Abbas batted beautifully and there was a twist that we had to make the game tougher by showing our full strength
 main teen wicket chatkaakar match jeetne main apane yogadan se kaaphi khush tha
 Thus we reached the final against hosts England
 final main mere shatak ke bare main kaaphi kuch likhaa gaya he, lekin jab main yaad karata hum to mujhe sirf colice king ke shandaar stroke hi laajawab lagate hai
 i was happy to only support Kolis during that partnership and was trying to give him as many strikes as possible
 unke 86 ran main kuch shot to aise the ki kisi bhi daur ke ballebaaj ko un par garv hoga! ham krij par us vakt saath hue the jab 100 par chaar wicket gir gaye the or kuch kathinaayee se team ko majboot sthiti main le gaye
 i kept changing the strike at the beginning of the innings and finally at the right moment i increased my pace
 iskaa shrey bhi colice ko he kyonki ve lagaataar ranon kii raftaar banaae hue the, taaki ham achche ausat se bana ran saken
 That century is also remembered because i hit a six off Michael Hendrick's last ball
 maine andaja laga liya tha ki ve yorker phenkane vaale hai or aage badhkar chakka jad diya tha
 That way of making a satisfactory score was really great but we knew that if we want to keep the Prudential Cup with us then we have to bowl well and fielding
 salaami ballebaajon ne pehle wicket ke liye kareeb 100 ranon kii saajhedaari karke acchhee takkar di thi lekin un dinon 290 ranon kii chunauti vikat hua karti thi
 Our bowling attack was very economical throughout the tournament
 england 50 overon main dhah gaya or hamen lagaataar duusari baar khitaab kaa maalik bana gaya
 We remember that occasion proudly because we were the best team in the world
 haalanki dilachasp yah bhi he ki ham jashn ke dauraan bhi apane pradarshan par gaur kar rahe the
 Laxity was not possible as some of us had to play Sunday League for our county teams a few days later
 hamamen se kuch sidhe apni car main baithe or apane usee gantavy kii ore chal pade! vishwa cap ek pakhwaade main jeet liya gaya or khilaadi apni county duty ke bare main sochane lage
 Those days were not so glorious as a condition! i remember those three finals with great pride as we were considered the favorite team to win in all three
 1983 kaa final hamaare khate main nahin aayaa lekin yahi to khel kii khubsuurati he—virdohi team agar acha khele to koi khitaab jeetne par aashwast nahin ho saktaa
 (the author scored a century in the 1979 finals and was the man of the match

 Last year, Anna's movement rocketed
 janalokapal ke sawaal par hue us andolan ne manmohan singh sarkaar ko jhukaa diya tha
 This year, his colleague Arvind Kejriwal broke the government's sleep by running the movement from Delhi to Farrukhabad and now former Army Chief General VK Singh has filled the movement for farmers
 chaar dashak se zyada samay tak general wike singh ne sarhad paar ke dushmano ke daant khattey kiye
 But after retiring, he has triggered the movement against the government
 general to vahi he, bas uski army badal gayi he
 Because this new captain has an army of farmers
 vardi utarkar sadri chadhaayi to jai jawan se baat aage badhkar jai kisaan tak ja pahunchi
 After retiring the General, who has commanded 21 lakh soldiers of the country, is now making a loud cry for the rights of the farmers and such that the big punches of democracy sitting directly in the biggest panchayat of the country should be heard
 jab army chif the, tab general sahab ne javaanon kii durdasha kii dastaan apane mantriji ko suna di thi
 Now, as a common man, we want to hear the voice of the farmers directly to the Prime Minister

 General VK Singh had shown his colors only when he had challenged those who were ruling from Anna's platform some time ago, by borrowing the words of Rashtrapati Ramdhani Singh Dinkar and now on the question of farmers after 4 December of the siege of Parliament The ultimatum is creating a new definition of his role

 Meanwhile, an Insta story of Varun is also in the discussion due to Timur
 darasal, karina kapur khan ke bete taimur ke saath varun ne ek meme saajha kiya he
 Taimur is one year old

 In this, the face of Varun and Timur is side by side
 varun kah rahe hai- taimur, 'kya tum jaanate ho aaj 31 kaa ho gaya hum
 To this, Timur replied - But Varun Bhaiya, you seem to be of my age
 varun bole-garlfriend chaahati he normal life, isliye protect karata huunudhar, oktober kii safalataa se khush najar aa rahe varun ne ek intervyuu main kaha he- oktober kii safalataa mahatvapurn he kyonki aisi safalataa se hi is tarah ke cinema ko protsaahit kiya ja saktaa he
 Critics and audiences have drawn reactions to Varun's role in the film
 tivi intervyuu main ek sawaal ke jawaab main varun ne kaha- main aalochanaon ko khule dil se sweekaar karata hum
 My friends, householders and Karan Johar often evaluate my work
 varun ne bataaya ki mauka milane par arjuna kapur bhi meri aalochana karnaa nahin bhoolatey
 When Varun Dhawan got cheated in love, at the age of 13, kissing on October, Varun said, After Badlapur, i was doing happy films

 But i reached a point where i lost my smile
 oktober ke dauraan maine koi endoxment, stage sho nahin kiya
 Only this film remained lost

 do hajaar saal se hota rahaa he pani ke liye sangharshpani kaa vitaran sahi karne kii he sakht jarurtindia today conklev ke duusare or aakhri din shanivaar ko maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fanvis, shivasena netaa aditya thakare, niti ayog ke vaais chairman rajeev kumaar or pi sainath jaisi hastiyon ne shirkat kii
 'panic Room: India's mega-water crisis in Conclave
 And our role in triggering it' seshan ke dauraan piples archive of rural india ke founder editor pi sainath ne india today kii Consulting Editor shoma choudhary ke sawaalon kaa bebaaki se jawaab diya
 p Sainath gave his views on the water crisis during the India Today Conclave
 unhone kaha ki aaj desh or duniya main jo jal sankat he yah sirf prakritik rup se nahin balki maanav dwaara khadaa kiya gaya sankat he
 He said, 'people say that there will be a war for water, but i believe that there has been a struggle for water for two thousand years
 sadiyon se pani kaa bantwaaraa ek samaan nahin rahaa he
 This is the root cause of conflict
 unhone kaha ki pani ke bantwaare main bhi jatvaad he
 You can see from ancient times that forward castes have been asserting their right to water first
 dalit log agar pani ke liye unke strot par jate the to unhen maaraa-peeta jaataa tha
 He said that 18 per cent of the world's population lives in India but we have only 4 per cent of drinking water available
 aise main agar ham pani kaa bantwaaraa sahi dhang nahin karenge to yah sankat gaharaata jayega or sangharsh kaa kaaran banegaa
 He presented the struggle on water as an example
 pi sainath ne kaha ki maharashtra ke karnul main ek kisaan ke parivaar main 5 bete the
 The farmer's land was divided into five sons
 isamen koi dikkat nahin thi
 But the younger brother killed the elder brother
 iskaa kaaran jaanakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge
 The reason for this was the battle for irrigated land
 bhaaiyon main jameen ke bantwaare nahin balki sinchit jameen ke bantwaare ko lekar vivaad hua or phir hatya kii naubat aa gai
 p Sainath said that political decisions are also a major reason for the water crisis
 sarkaar kii ore se agar pani ko lekar sahi faisle nahin kiye gaye to jal sankat gaharaata jayega
 He explained this through several examples
 unhone kaha ki aap mumbai se pune kii ore jaaenge to haive par aapako bilderon ke kai hordings dikhaai denge
 He also showed pictures of some of them hoardings
 ek builder multi story building bana rahaa he
 In it, he claimed that he would provide a swimming pool on every floor of the building i
e
 he would provide a swimming pool balcony in the flat
 sochie iske liye pani kaa kitna miss yuj hoga
 If he manages to make it, he will seek clearance from the department concerned
 iskaa matlab he ki sarkaar agar aisa faisla legi to jal sankat bilkul badhegaa
 He said that the government will have to do good planning for the water crisis
 aisa plan banaaya jaae ki sabko pani mili or iske liye sabase pehle pani ko basic rhite yani mul adhikaar ke rup main ghoshit karnaa chahie
 If the current availability of water that we have is right, the water crisis can be reduced if we avoid its wasteful use

 arvind kejariwal kene audio stingke baad aam aadmi party (AAP) main kalah or tej ho gai he
 In the tape, Arvind Kejriwal is heard using abuses for Yogendra Yadav, Prashant Bhushan and Professor Anand Kumar
 is par yogendra yadav ne kaha he ki unhen chote bhai ne gaali di he or unhen koi shikaayat nahin he
 i am hurt and embarrassed: Hurt by the language of Anand Kumar Kejriwal, Professor Anand Kumar said, 'I am feeling hurt and embarrassed and expect it to be a lie
 unase puuchhie jinhone yah bhashaa istemaal kii ho
 During my career no one used such language for anyone
 'nayaa tepe saamne aane ke baad kejariwal kheme ke netaaon kii baithak hui
 Ashish Khaitan, who was involved in the meeting, said, 'we discussed what is going on in the party
 hamen niraashaa hui he
 We are more scared of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan's press conference than Amit Shah's press conference
 agar hamane unke hisse kii baatcheet record kar lee hoti to vah janata ke saamne munh dikhaane laayak nahin hote
 'gopal Rai told that Kejriwal expressed the pain due to which he is getting two-four in the meeting
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki phone par hui baat ke bhav zyada khatarnaak hai
 Language can be bad in anger, but the expressions are dirty
 unhone kaha ki party kisi kii jaagir nahin he
 The activists and the National Council are paramount here
 chote bhai ne di he gaali, mujhe shikaayat nahin: yogendralaaf netaa yogendra yadav ne is par hameshaa kii tarah apane 'madhur' andaaj main pratikriya di
 He said, 'last year Arvind Kejriwal considered me his elder brother
 agar unhone aisa kuch kaha he to vah mere chote bhai hai, mujhe koi shikaayat nahin he
 Personal humiliation is not such a big deal
 yah mere liye bilkul bhi mudda nahin he
 People will not remember who was insulted, rather people will remember what we did for the country
 'aapako to kejariwal kii tarif kerani chahie: ashutoshaparty is mudde par kejariwal ke saath khadi najar aa rahi he
 AAP leader Ashutosh said, 'if this is Kejriwal's voice, he should not have used such words
 lekin baatcheet ko alag sandarbh main dekha janaa chahie
 Naturally anyone can get angry if someone tries to break or defeat the party
 kai baar log gusse main aisi baaten kah jate hai
 You should appreciate that anyone can talk to the national convenor
 iskaa matlab he ki yah arvind kejariwal kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchane kii sajeesh he
 However, the authenticity of the tape has not yet been proved
 kal jab deal puri hui achaanak ek sting saamne aa gaya
 In this i see a conspiracy to tarnish Kejriwal's image
 'chhavi bigaadane kii koshish: dilip pandekejariwal kheme ke ek or netaa dilip pandey ne kaha ki party kii jeet ke baad se kejariwal kii chhavi kharaab karne ke makasad se farji sting saamne aa rahe hai
 This is a conspiracy to spoil Kejriwal's image
 agar aap kisi nijee baatcheet ko sting kehane lagenge to aap murkh kehlaayenge
 It is not right to call it a sting
 ab chup kyon hai kejariwal: bijepiap netaaon par satta kaa lobh or avasarwaadi hone ke aarope lagaate hue bijepi ne aaj arvind kejariwal ko chunauti di ki vah apni hi party ke logon ke aaropon par spashtikaran den or kaha ki puure desh ke samaksh unka asli cheharaa ujagar ho gaya he
 The BJP also said that according to the allegations made by their own people in a sting, AAP does not have transparency and democracy and its big claims of principle and swaraj are fraudulent
 bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv shrikant sharma ne kaha, kejariwal duusare kii galatiyon kaa bhandaphod karne par kaaphi bolte hai lekin unke logon ne hi unka bhandaphod kar diya 
 His people removed his mask
 unhone kaha, kejariwal ko sting main apane logon dwaara lagaae gaye aaropon par spashtikaran dena chahie 
 Why are they silent Their silence shows that the things that are coming out freely are true

 hindustani awam morcha ke rashtriya adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi buudhvaar ko endie kaa daaman chhod mahagathbandhan main shaamil ho gaye
 a joint press conference of Jitan Ram Manjhi and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav was also held on Wednesday evening, where a formal announcement was made
 is sanyukt press vaarta ko sambodhit karte hue jithan ram maanjhi ne wo tamaam vajah bataayin, jiske chalate unhone endie chhodkar mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kaa faisla kiya
 Interestingly, in the same joint press conference, Manjhi claimed that RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav talked to him over the telephone and invited him to join the grand alliance, after which he decided to do so
 haalanki, maanjhi ne yah nahin bataaya ki lalu prasad ne unase telephone par kab baat kii
 But the question arises that right now RJD supremo is lodged in Birsa Munda Jail of Ranchi after being convicted in the fodder scam case, did Lalu telephone Himanjhi from jail and invite him to join the grand alliance? It has been because Lalu Prasad has been lodged in Ranchi Jail since 23 December 2017 and before that there was not much talk of Jitan Ram Manjhi joining the Grand Alliance
 haal ke dinon main jithan ram maanjhi kii endie se dooriyaan is vajah se bad gai kyonki 11 march ko jahanabad vidhansabha seat ke liye hone vaale upachunaav ke liye maanjhi apni party kaa ummidavaar utaarna chaahate the, magar bhaajapa ne unhen yah seat nahin di or iske badale unhone jadyu ko yahaan se chunaav ladane ke liye kaha
 According to sources, Jitan Ram Manjhi wanted the BJP to send him to the Rajya Sabha in the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections
 magar iske liye bhi party taiyaar nahin hui jiske baad maanjhi kaa endie se mohabhang ho gaya or unhone mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kaa faisla kiya
 This whole incident is for the last 15 days, when Manjhi decided to leave the NDA and join the Grand Alliance
 sawaal uthta he to kya inhen sab ghatnakram ke bich argedy supremeo lalu prasad ne unhen ranchi jail se telephone karke mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone ke liye kaha jiskaa zikr maanjhi ne buudhvaar ko kiya? When Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal was preparing his Rail Budget speech, he might not have any idea that the apprehension expressed in the poem which he is going to read will prove to be true
 unhone rail bajet pesh karte samay dushyant kii panktiyaan padhi, ‘hangaamaa khadaa karnaa meraa makasad nahin, koshish he ki surat badalani chahie
 'but the apprehension of these lines proved to be true in the Lok Sabha as Bansal could not complete his railway speech due to the uproar of the opposition
 bansal ne rail bajet ke dauraan jin panktiyon ko apni prerana kaa strot bataaya vah christine vaidarly kii kavita ‘da sang aaf da ingine’ se lee gai thim
 The translation of this poem written in English is as follows: 'when you travel on the rail, and the rail climbs the mountain, just listen to the sound of the engine
 jo puri ichhashakti ke saath aapako lekar upar chadhataa he haalanki yah bahut dhire-dhire chalata he lekin yah ek chota sa geet gaata he : main kar saktaa hum, main kar saktaa hum
 ' itnaa hi nahin, unhone apane bhaashan kaa samaapan bhi christine vaidarly kii isi kavita kii antim panktiyon se kiya
 However, the final lines could not be heard due to opposition uproar
 tippaniyan These last lines were as follows: but in a later journey
 
 
 ingine abhi bhi ga rahaa he
 If you listen very calmly
 
 
 aap yah chota sa geet sunenge

 There is intense debate over the Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC across the country
 vipaksh or sarkaar ise lekar apane-apane daawey kar rahe hai
 Many questions related to this are in the minds of people
 aise hi kuch sawaal ajtak ne apane khaas aayojan 'agenda ajtak 2019' main khud grih mantri amit shah se puche
 These questions were raised by TV Today Group news director Rahul Kanwal during a long conversation with Shah on different topics
 pesh hai rahul kanwal ke sawaal or amit shah ke javaabah-sawaal: aapane sansad se naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon paas karavaaya he, iske baad desh bhar main, khaas kar vishvavidhyalay or college main virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai, hinsa bhi hui he
 How do you see this violence and Protest? Amit Shah: First of all, let me make it clear that the use of this word is not good in many universities, there are 224 universities across the country, if you add private universities then the figure is over 300
 goes
 inamen se 22 vishvavidhyalay main pradarshan hua he
 Out of these, 4 have had serious performances
 jaise-jmi, AMU lakhanu kii nadwa
 
 
 There have been serious performances in three such four universities
 baaki jagah in pradarshan ke samarthan main log jamaa hue hai jahaan, 100, 200, 300, 20, 11 log jamaa hue hai
 So there are 22 such universities in 224 where demonstrations have taken place
 isliye ye kah dena ki bahut uniwarsity main pradarshan hua he, ye thik nahin he, ye simit maatra main hua he
 "this demonstration is also happening because the children have not read the citizenship law properly
 aapke kaarykram ke madhyam se apil karnaa chahta hum ki log is act ko thik dhang se study karen, or unhen lagata he ki kuch galat he to sarkaar unke saath charchaa karne ko taiyaar he
 i think that as people understand these laws, the protest against it will decrease
 sawaal: CAA ke virodh main JMI main chaatro kaa virodh ho rahaa tha, uske baad vahaan par jo hinsa hui us par kaabo paane ke liye dilli police campus main ghusi
 
 
 The allegation is that the police entered the hostel-library where the students were hiding
 aap grih mantri hai, dilli police aapako report karti he
 
 
 Why did he enter Delhi Police Campus, Library College? Amit Shah: See, as far as the students are concerned, there is no question of the police coming after them
 magar uniwarsity campus ke andar se patharav hota he
 University students, either those who study together with students, come out, stop someone's scooter, stop two wheels, stop mopeds
 
 
 petrol nikaalte hai, bas jalaate hai
 
 
 They try to burn someone's car and even if the police does not do anything at that time, then i believe that the police is not doing its duty properly
 jab protest hinsa kaa swaroop letaa he to usko rokna police kaa ferj bhi he or dharm bhi he
 Which those people have played
 jahaan tak police ko andar janaa chahie tha, nahin janaa chahie tha, abhi ye kahana isliye uchit nahin hoga
 
 
 i believe that the police will take a decision on this at an appropriate time
 sawaal: lekin kya aapane dilli police se poocha ki bagaiyr VC kii ijaajat ke wo kaise ghusi?amit shah:abhi grih mantri hone ke naate maine dilli police ko yahi kaha ki purna shanti dilli main kariye, ye aapaki jimmedaari he
 Everything else will be talked about after peace
 grih mantri ke liye mahatvapurn sawaal he ki dilli main shanti ho


wo maine kiya
 Question: Violence erupted in Jamia Millia Islamia
 After that we saw that there was tension in Seelampur area as well, there was stonewalling on the police
 
 
 aapke hisaab se aisa kyon ho rahaa he, or is par kaabo paane ke liye aapaki kya ranneeti he?amit shah:dekhie vipaksh ekajute hokar CAA ke vishay main afvaahen failaa rahaa he ki isse minurity ko alag-thalag kar denge
 i want to tell all the brothers and sisters of the minority that this act is not going to harm you even a little
 kyonki is act se kisi kii citijanship jaati hi nahin he, ye kisi ko naagarikta dene kaa kanoon he
 And when there is a law to give citizenship to someone, there is no need to worry about citizens of India and mainly Muslims
 jo teen deshon se afghanistan, pakistan or bangladesh se dharmik pratadna ke kaaran aae hue jo alpsankhyak hai jisamen sikh, buddha, jain, parsi, krishchayan, hinduon ko naagarikta dene kaa kaam saral karne ke liye is kanoon main badlaav kiya gaya he
 Question: Two questions are formed, CAA has no problem if seen alone, but when this act is seen by connecting it to NRC then it becomes a dangerous combination
 aapane kaha he ki 2024 se pehle NRC kii prakriya ko aap puri karenge
 Will ask people for proof of citizenship
 kuch dastavej jamaa karenge, kuch logon ke paas dastavej nahin honge
 These two categories can be either they can be non-muslim, if they are Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, Christian Hindu then you will give them citizenship immediately, but if they become Muslim then you will immediately give them in detention camp Will stop kya ye thik he?amit shah:pehle main spasht kar duun ki NRC main dharm ke aadhaar par koi karrwai nahin hogi
 Anyone who is not found to be a citizen of this country under the NRC will be expelled from the country
 to ye kahana he ki sirf musalamaanon ke liye NRC hogi ye kahana mere hisaab se purnatah galat he
 Secondly, who brought the NRC
 aaj jo log virodh kar rahe hai
 
 
 Congress President
 
 
 gulam nabi aaazaad ko poochna chahta hum, 1985 main jab assam samjhauta hua to pehali baar NRC kii baat sweekaar kii gai, baad main 1955 ke naagarikta kanoon main cloj-14 e joda gaya 3 disambar 2004 ko
 
 
 The UPA was in power at that time
 hamaari nahin thi
 After that, Rule 4 was added which gives the power to create NRC across the country, it was also added on 9 November 2009
 us vakt bhi congress kii sarkaar thi
 Today they were questioning his law made by us
 to kya kanoon aapane shokes main rakhane ke liye banaaya tha? jaruri nahin lagata to kyon banaae?sawaal: NRC alag se dekhte hai to koi dikkat nahin he
 Hemant Biswa Sharma, aap's government aide in Kolkata, said NRC and CAA are combo
 assam main bijepi netaa kah rahe hai ki assam main 19 aise kshetra hai jahaan par hindu bengali jud jaaenge to us kshetra kaa jansankhya sameekaran badal jayega
 And here BJP will benefit
 in donon ko saath main dekhne par sawaal khadaa hota he ki aakhir manshaa kya he?amit shah:isko costituency ke saath jodakar mat dekhie
 
 
 One has to go back to understand the whole issue
 sabase pehali baat he ki is desh kaa vibhaajan dharm ke aadhaar par nahin hona chahie tha
 But this is a harsh reality
 desh kaa vibhaajan dharm ke aadhaar par hua
 The Congress surrendered on the demand for partition, and this country was divided on the basis of religion
 bahut saare log maare gaye
 Many people were tortured
 lakhon-lakhon sharnaarthi yahaan aae or lakhon sharnaarthi vahaan gaye
 Even after that, many Muslims stayed here, should have stayed, because we said that we are secular country, we will become secular
 acchhee baat he, unako koi aanch nahin aani chahie
 Many Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis stayed there
 unki sabko chintaa thi ki baad main unka kya hoga
 There was a huge demand
 1950 main nehru or liyakat ali khan ke bich dilli main samjhauta hua, donon deshon ke alpsankhyakon kii suraksha ko lekar
 Both countries set their security
 jab donon deshon ne samjhauta kiya to aabaadi kya thi
 In present-day Pakistan, about 23 percent of the population was of Hindus, 30 percent of Hindus in Bangladesh, which was then called East Pakistan
 aaj pakistan main 3 pratishat rah gaye
 Where did you go? dharm parivartan karaayaa gaya jabaran
 Either they came here to save religion
 jahaan par 30 pratishat the aaj 7 pratishat hai
 
 
 Where did you go? There are many stories
 
 
 sansad main maine bataaya
 
 
 The girls were forcibly converted to marriage

 Today i want to tell you
 
 
 congress jo kahati he pandit jawahar laal nehru kaa kathan suniye
 "we are being watched by our brothers and sisters who have been away from us due to political limitations and cannot join the freedom struggle at this time
 unki bhi chintaa he
 Whatever happens, he belongs to us and will always be ours
 unke sukh-dukh main ham samaan rup se sahabhaagi honge or wo jab bhi aana chahenge ham unhen sweekaar karenge
 "'rajendra Prasad said at the time of his swearing-in we are anxious to resettle the displaced persons who are facing considerable hardship and inconvenience
 wo kabhi bhi yahaan aaen unka swaagat he
 Will not say about Sardar Patel, Congress will not accept him
 ab congress party kaa prastaav suniye, "25 november 1947, congress kaaryakarini ne nimnlikhit sankalp angikaar kiya
 All those non-muslims of Congress Pakistan
 
 
 mere shabd dhyaan se suniye
 
 
 i have not said so
 
 
 
 If we say that we will become Hinduists, the Congress will be secular
 
 
 congress pakistan ke un sabhi gaiyr muslimon ko purna suraksha dene ke liye baadhya he
 Those who have come or are coming to India after crossing the border to protect their lives and honor
 " ye congress kaa kamitment he
 Now hear about Mahatma Gandhi
 
 
 
 Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan, if they do not want to live there, can undoubtedly come to India
 is maamle main unako rojgaar dena, naagarikta dena or sammanpurvak sukhkar jivan dena bharat sarkaar kaa pratham kartavya he
 This is the statement of 7 July 1947
 ab manmohan singh ne kya kaha ye suniye
 Former Prime Minister who is doing Protest today
 
 
 unhone 18 disambar 2003 ko kaha, "alpsankhyakon ko bangladesh jaise deshon main utpeedan kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 If circumstances force these people, then our moral obligation is to grant citizenship to these unfortunate people
 is bare main sarkaar ko sochna chahie
 "later Ashok Gehlot wrote a letter to P
 Chidambaram in 2009," i want to bring your attention to the displaced Hindu and Sikh community from Pakistan, they are displaced illiterate, come from SC, ST and backward society
 " 
 
 atyant garibi main ji rahe hai ve bharat kii naagarikta kii maang kar rahe hai unako tatkaal naagarikta dene kii yojana banani chahie
 "this is the stand of all the people of Congress
 parantu vot vaink kii raajnneeti ke kaaran congress apane vaade se mukar gai
 Neither do we do vote bank politics, nor will we allow it

 i said earlier that the Congress started NRC and leave it
 aaj bhi main congress adhyaksha sonia gandhi or gulam nabi ko kahana chahta hum
 
 
 You make a statement that all the Muslims in Pakistan and Bangladesh should come here and we will give citizenship to them
 jo wo kah rahe hai ki ghuspaithiyon ko bhi naagarikta do
 Question: People do not have documents, how will they prove citizenship
 vipaksh to kaha he ki marksheet dikhaane main dikkat ho rahi he
 
 
 Where will the poor people show the documents? Amit Shah: The Assam Accord keeps the 1971 voter list as a record
 usamen unke naam hai, vahi dastavej he
 it is no problem
 unke pita ke naam 1971 kii matadaata suchi main hai hi
 Is there any country in the world that does not have a civil register? Whoever goes there can become a citizen? Can a citizen here take citizenship there? So does the Congress party want to say that any Muslim should come from all over the world, because if you are taking a Hindu then you should accept that too
 aise desh chalata he kya?'jahaan tak bhedbhaav kaa sawaal he europe ke kai deshon ne naagarikta ke liye niyam banaae hai ki itnaa investment karoge tabhi hamaare desh kii naagarikta milegi
 Isn't this discrimination against the poor? We will give you citizenship only when we are so educated, is it not discrimination against the illiterate? bharat ke padhe-likhe vaigyanikon ko le rahe ho to bharat ke garib ko bhi le jaao
 Who are asking us why are they discriminated against? So you have also discriminated differently
 lekin hamane koi bhedbhaav nahin kiya he
 At the time of Partition, the promise of India was that the Hindus and Sikh brothers who remained there, who are a minority in that country, would accept them if they did not want to live in that country
 yah hamaare desh ke sadan kaa vachan he, desh ke governor general kaa vachan he, is desh ke pradhanmantri kaa vachan he or sabase upar mahatma gandhi kaa kamitment he
 Which the whole country believes
 phir inaki entry par kyon sawaal uthaaya ja rahaa he?'sawaal: utpeedan ke aadhaar par naagarikta kyon nahin di ja rahi he
 
 
 The persecution may be on the basis of language, on the basis of sect, on the basis of faith, Ahmadiyah is being persecuted in Pakistan
 utpeedan kyon aadhaar nahin ho saktaa he
 Amit Shah: Our Act provides that we have given citizenship to 600 Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan
 hamaare desh kii sansad, us vakt ke pradhanmantri, us vakt ke raashtrapati or mahatma gandhi kaa kamitment he ki in teen deshon ke alpsankhyak jab bhi vahaan nahin rahanaa chaahate to yahaan aakar unhen sharan di jaaegi, naagarikta di jaaegi
 i agree that this is duty
 ye teenon desh hai vibhaajan ke kaaran
 Today i would like to ask the leaders of the Congress that if all Hindus came from Uganda, why did you give citizenship to Hindus? Tomorrow, as if God forbid, do as France did in Uganda
 france main koi aisa shaasha aakar kahe ki hinduon ko nikaal denge, to hindu kahaan jayega? duniya main jayega kahaan wo, yaheen aayega or kahin nahin ja saktaa, yaheen aayega
 Where Sikh will go, he will come here only
 agar africa se sabko nikaal diya to yaheen aayega or hamen swikaarna chahie
 Question: Why did you keep this law for 3 countries? Tamil Hindus are being persecuted in Sri Lanka on the basis of religion
 shrishri ravishankar or swami unke liye naagarikta kii maang kar rahe hai?amit shah:desh main kai baar naagarikta dene ke alag-alag praavdhaan kiye
 Also made for Lanka
 6 lakh se zyada tamil bhaaiyon ko jo srilanka se aae the unhen hamane naagarikta di
 Why were they not given citizenship at that time? We were addressing a problem
 uganda se aae tab inako kyon nahin di? 1971 main indira ji ne samuhik naagarikta di
 Then why didn't we give them? Because we were solving the particular problem
 sawaal: aapane kaha ki france yaa germany main hinduon kaa utpeedan hota he to ve kahaan jaaenge, yahi aaenge, bijepi or khaastaur par aresas ke iken hai saavarkar, unhone bharat kii soch ek hindu raashtra ke taur par banaai, kya aaj kii bijepi sarkaar bharat ko hindu raashtra ke taur par dekhati he?amit shah:'jaraa bhi nahin, ham bharat ko samvidhan ke mutabik dekhte hai
 The country can have only one religion, the government can have only one religion, that is our constitution
 iske alaave koi dharm nahin ho saktaa he
 Question: There is fear, fear in the minority society of the country
 desh kii minurity community ko aap kya bharosa dena chaahate hai?amit shah:main abhi bhay dur kiye detaa hum
 
 
 There is no need to fear that the citizens of the original India, irrespective of religion, NRC will never exclude you, we will make special efforts to convince Minority because confusion has been spread among them
 kisi ko darane kii jarurat nahin he, kisi ko pratadit nahin kiya jayega
 But the country does not move such that it leaves the borders open, whatever it wants to come
 
 
 jo ghuspaithiye hai unhen jarur janaa chahie, main maanata hum ki unhen swat: kahana chahie ki ham galati se aa gaye hamen waapas bhejne kii vyavastha kii jaae
 According to Home Ministry sources, the issue of Jaish-e Mohammed's mastermind, Masood Azhar, can be put on hold by China right now
 sutron kaa daawa he ki masood ke khilaaf yuan ke prastaav par faisla lene main china teen maheene kaa vakt le saktaa he
 Earlier on Wednesday, it was reported that China has spoken to the UN at the time of reviewing the pending application declaring Masood Azhar as a terrorist
 bataa den ki ajahar kii napak harkate duniya main jagajaahir hai
 Despite this, China is not yet stamping it as a terrorist
 china videsh mantralay ne kaha ki china samay aane par faisla legaa
 Whereas earlier this year, China technically stayed the application for six months
 videsh mantralay ko is arji kii jald hi samiksha hone kii ummid he
 The Ministry had earlier said in a written reply that we have conveyed China's stand to the 1267 Committee of the United Nations Security Council several times
 china yah kahkar bharat ke kadam kaa virodh kar rahaa he ki yuanessi 1267 main koi sahmati nahin he
 UNSC 1267 imposes global sanctions on terrorist organizations and their leaders

 In the 2014 elections, BJP candidate Kambhamapati Hari Babu defeated YSR Congress candidate YS Vijayamma by 90 thousand votes
 tab bijepi or tidipi gathbandhan main is seat par jeet darj kii thi lekin is baar donon partiyaan alag alag chunaav lard rahi hai
 So, this time, the equations are changing in Visakhapatnam seat
 bijepi or tidipi donon apni jeet ke daawey kar rahe hai to duusari ore wiesar congress bhi jeet kii ummid lagaae baithi he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won two seats in Andhra Pradesh, one of them is Visakhapatnam
 bijepi ne is baar purv kendriya mantri di
 Purandeshwari has been made its candidate

 Purandeswari is a well-known face in this seat but TDP has fielded m Sri Bharata to spoil the bjp's equation
 wiesar congress ne bhi apane kaddavar ummidavaar emvivi satyanarayan ko tikat diya he
 Visakhapatnam constituency was formed in 1984

 In many rural areas of West Bengal, people from the Muslim community are joining the BJP
 khaskar un ilaakon main jahaan party ke vot share main apratyaashit badhotaree darj kii gai he
 The news to this effect has been published by the English newspaper The Indian Express
 akhbaar ke mutabik, pashchim bengal ke gramin ilaake khaskar jalpaigudi, alipuraduaar, kuchbihar loksabhaa seat or raiganj, baloorghat or nadia ke kuch ilaakon main saikadon muslim parivaar bijepi main shaamil ho rahe hai
 The BJP is organizing a contribution program in these areas
 16 may ko nattejey hone ghoshit ke baad se hi rajya ke in ilaakon main party ne is kaarykram kaa aagaaj kar diya tha
 However, there is no official figure of how many people have joined BJP through this whole process so far
 par sthaneey bijepi ikai ke mutabik sirf jalpaigudi ilaake main kareeb 5 xxrep 4 0 log party se jude hai
 Many reasons are being given for this political event
 musmil samudaay ke log raajnneetik vishwaas, dar or left netritv ke kamjor hone kii vajah se bijepi main shaamil ho rahe hai
 Apart from this, local BJP leaders are only talking about development in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 vah logon ko bataa rahe hai ki party ke agenda par naukari, suraksha or aarthik sampannataa he na ki hindutv
 For which they are getting benefit
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa laal kile kii pracheer se diya gaya dhara pravaah bhaashan logon ko kaaphi samay tak yaad rahegaa kyonki varshon se desh kii janata ne laal kile se kuch aisa nahin suna tha ki jo unke dil ko chhu sake
 People had started thinking of it as a nonvent after merely listening to statistics and hollow facts about the so-called progress, but PM Modi revived it and that too without big promises
 unhone sarkari ghoshnaaon kii bajaay janata or saansadon ko unke kartavyon kii yaad dilaai
 He made small things like cleaning look very big
 unhone apane har kadam par janata ko saath lene kii baat kahi jo parampara se hatakar he
 This is a very big thing because people in India have got the habit of doing the work of the government
 lekin piem modi ne use apane saath jod liya kyonki unhen pataa he ki janata ke saath ke bina is vishaal desh ko svachh rakhane kaa koi bhi abhiyaan safal nahin ho saktaa he
 All the schemes made by the government will prove fruitless without the participation of the public
 yah loktantr kaa takaza bhi he ki har choti-badi yojana ke karyanvayan main janata ko joda janaa chahie
 The Prime Minister did the same
 kul milakar yah ek behad safal kaarykram or thos shuruyaat rahi
 But the pm's silence on issues like inflation and corruption surprises some
 ye donon unke chunavi mudde the or unhone un par ankush lagane kaa vaada bhi kiya tha
 He neither made any mention of the steps to be taken to curb inflation, nor did he discuss it indirectly
 thik isi tarah lokapal bill yaa aise kisi kadam ke bare main bhi vah chup rahe jabaki apane chunavi bhaashanon main unhone is par kaaphi kuch kaha tha
 He may not want to make this platform a platform to announce, but he could have made a gesture
 ye donon aise mudde hai jinpar unki sarkaar kii safalataa yaa vifaltaa tiki hui he
 Inflation has dropped many governments and corruption is making the country's roots hollow
 in par chuppi saadhe rakhana kisi ranneeti kaa hissaa nahin ho saktaa he
 They will have to talk on this and will have to take steps because the patience of the public cannot be sustained for very long
 iske alaava ye pradhan mantri modi kii chunavi ghoshnaa kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa bhi tha
 Obviously, they will work on these and will also take tough steps but there was nothing wrong in giving a glimpse of it
 ab ummid kii ja sakati he ki pradhanmantri in par koi na koi kadam uthaane kii taiyaari main honge
 Inflation can be overcome by ensuring better administration and wider supply of food items, but drastic steps will be needed to remove corruption
 in kadamon kii sabhi ko intjaar he
 a case of rape of a 25-year-old IT professional living in Bangalore has come to light
 peedit ladki ne aarope lagaaya he ki shuukravaar der raat uske piji hostel ke kamare main ek shaks ghus aayaa or usne chaaku dikhaakar paise or jewelery kii maang kii or uske baad uske saath balaatkaar kiya

 As usual, picked up the newspaper and reversed a few pages to reach the film page
 us filmi pej main ek story par najar padi, jisamen 2015 main aane vaali kuch badi or chuninda filmon kii release kii tarikh kaa byoraa chapa tha
 Nearly, the names of some Bollywood directors and their favorite films were written
 sabhi ne apni-apni pasandida filmon ke naam bataae or kaha ki yah film main dekhuunga
 But i was shocked to see the name and choice of producer Tigmanshu Dhulia
 is akhbaar ke mutabik, vah 2015 main 'jagga jasoos', 'badlapur', 'shamitabh', 'bombai velvet', 'byomakesh bakshi', 'fitur' or 'yaara' dekhnaa chahenge
 The list of Tigmanshu did not surprise me but rather the sentence next to him which wrote "these are the films; the rest are circus pieces" ab tigmanshu sarkas pis kin filmon ko kah rahe hai? 2015 main shahrukh kii film 'fain, salmaan kii film 'bajrangi bhai jaan' or 'prem ratan dhan payo', arjuna kapur kii film 'tevar', saf kii film 'phantum', ranbir kapur kii film 'roy', ranvir singh kii film 'baaji raav mastaani' jaisi badi filmein mukhya hai
 So does Tigmanshu find these films like circus pieces? filmi patrkaar hum isliye kabhi-kabhi flash back main chalaa jaataa hum or jaise hi maine yah padhaa, vaise hi flash back main chalaa gaya or pahunchaa film 'bullate raja' kii press conference main
 'bullet Raja' had Saif Ali Khan and Sonakshi Sinha in the lead roles and Tigmanshu Dhulia was the film's director
 ye film bollywood masala film yaa ise campalit commercial film kah sakate hai
 i still remember when Tigmanshu said in that press conference that "filmmakers like us will change the look and feel of commercial films when we make commercial films" Tigmanshu also said that i would like to air the hero like other directors Can not get such a box killed by blowing in it, so that the goon fell from a box four times
 us vakt mujhe unki bhashaa or bayaan main ghamand nazar aayaa tha
 And they say that vanity is always shattered
 aisa hi hua, jab film 'bullate raja' buree tarah flop ho gai
 Let me also tell a little about Tigmanshu's films
 inaki pehali film 'hasil' box offis par bahut safal nahin thi, magar samikshakon ne film ko saraahaa tha
 Tigmanshu then made the film 'charas', which flopped badly
 bich main kaaphi samay tak ye seen se baahar rahe, is bich film banaai 'paan singh tomars'
 Probably not trusting Tigmanshu, the film was not released for many years
 baad main utivi ne film ko relies kiya or film na sirf hit hui, balki kaaphi saraahna bhi hui
 Meanwhile, the film 'saheb Biwi Aur Gangsters' had done a decent business
 'paan singh tomars' or 'sahib bivi or gangsters' kii safalataa ke baad tigmanshu ke din palat chuke the
 Now he had got the big movie 'bullet Raja' with big budget big star and his big lyrics started
 is industry main bahut saare nirdeshak hai, jinhone badi kaamyaab or acchhee filmein banaate hai
 Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra made great films like 'rang De Basanti' and 'bhaag Milkha Bhaag'
 magar kabhi aisi badi baat nahin boli, jisase unka ghamand chhalke
 The most respected director to date is Raju Hirani
 box offis se lekar samikshakon kaa bhi dil jeet lete hai, magar aisi badi baat kabhi nahin boli, jisamen unka ahankaar najar aae
 The most successful director of today's box office is Rohit Shetty, but never says that i am shooting big arrows
 ye sabhi jaanate hai ki ahamkaari kaa sir neeche jhuk hi jaataa he or yah bhi jaanate hai ki alag-alag tarah kii filmein banati hai or alag-alag tarah kii filmon ke alag-alag darshak hote hai
 Star power also plays here and good story and theme too
 tigmanshu dhulia ne na hi 'sholay' banaai he or na hi 'mughle aazam' phir bhi bol bade-bade
 By the way, there was another victim of Bade Bol, named Sajid Khan
 'he baby' or 'housephul' kii safalataa ke baad unke bol bhi aise hi the
 He had spoken many times that my film could not be a flop
 main darshakon ke liye film banaata hum or unki pasand bahut achche se jaanata hum
 On the Muhurta of the film 'himmatwala', Sajid had said that 'himmatwala' would earn 100 crores in 4 to 5 days, but 'himmatwala' flopped badly
 film 'hamashklas' kaa hashr bhi bura hua
 In such a situation, it is clear that whoever spoke the big words downplayed his words
 utar pradesh main mangalvaar ko kanpur or lakhanu main aatankiyon ke khilaaf bada abhiyaan chalaaya gaya

 "chaudhary further said," i think Suspect is a resident of Lucknow and he may also have a weapon, due to which we are not going inside and carrying out the tactical operation
 " abhi ham keval ek hi aatanki ke andar hone ke kayaas laga rahe hai
 The input we had came from outside the state

 vah gussa jo vahaan nikalnaa tha, vah yahaan nikaala gaya
 Referring to the NDA getting an absolute majority, Modi said, "after several years, a majority government will be formed again
