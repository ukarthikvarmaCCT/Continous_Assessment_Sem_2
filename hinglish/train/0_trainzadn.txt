 kishor bataate hai ki satapura kaa ilaaka 25 hajaar varg kilometre ke kshetra main failaa hua he
 This entire area cannot be reached simultaneously, as there are many National Parks and Centuries in this entire area
 saath hi kuch aise bhi kshetra hai, jo kipark or cenchurito nahin hai lekin vahaan par baagh rahete hai
 He started working with his team in these areas, where tigers still live
 uske baad unhone bafer aria ke gaanvon main kaam karne kii sochi
 He then thought that if the funds were saved, he would carry out the work of Tiger Reserve and Jungle Corridor
 madhyapradesh ke alag-alag hisson main failaa he network
 
 
 Satpura Foundation has been working during the last 15 years in the portion of Kanha Reserve Park in Mangla district, Pench National Park in Seoni district of Madhya Pradesh, Tadoba National Park in Chandrapur and Melghat in Amravati, Maharashtra
 yahaan kaam karne vaali inaki kor team ne apana ek majboot aadharbhoot dhaancha taiyaar kiya he
 Their network is spread over 115 villages here

 Kishore says that there are many difficulties in this work, despite the increase in the number of tigers here in these 15 years
 shiksha ke jariye muhim ko de rahe hai dhar
 
 
 The Satpura Foundation is also working on children's education and health
 inkaa kahana he jin 115 gaanvon main ye log kaam kar rahe hai vahaan par lagbhag har baccha skool jaataa he
 Through education, children are told why forests and wildlife are important for people
 ye bacchon ko bataate hai ki agar fasalon kojunglee jaanavaransht kar dete hai to aise main agar baagh hoga to ye jaanavar apane aap khatm ho jaaenge kyonki ye jaanavar hi baaghon kaa bhojan hai
 Kishore believes that if he says this directly to his parents, then he does not listen to them, but they quickly understand the children
 ab ham to ishwar se bas yahi prarthana karenge ki kishor apni muhim main safal hon or baaghon kii sankhya bhi din-par-din yun hi anwarat badhati rahe

 After Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party is going to step into the politics of Gujarat
 AAP netaa gopal raay ne shuukravaar ko bataaya ki aam aadmi party gujarat main aam aadmi party kaa sanghathan 150 siton par kaam kar rahaa he
 The party will contest the same seat on which the BJP will feel weak
 kitni seat par chunaav ladanaa he ye PAC baithak ke baad hi tay hoga
 However, nothing has been told about who will be a bigger face than AAP party in Gujarat
 kaha ja rahaa he ki aam aadmi party ko yadi gujarat kii janata pasand karti he to yah bijepi or congress ke liye mushkil vakt hoga
 Let us tell you that the political temperature of Gujarat is very hot for the last one month
 bijepi gujarat kii satta par pichley paanch baar se kabiz he or chhathi baar ke liye betaab he
 At the same time, the Congress has been facing the exile of power in Gujarat for two decades, to eliminate which Rahul is struggling on the land of the state
 gujarat main kul 182 vidhansabha siten hai
 The BJP won the 2012 assembly elections with a thumping majority
 rajya kii 182 siton main se bijepi ne 115, congress 61 or anya ko 4 siten mili thi
 But in the Rajya Sabha elections held in August, many Congress mlas have joined BJP
 gujarat ke 2012 vidhansabha chunaav main mili voton par najar daalen to bijepi ko 47 fisadi or congress ko 38 fisadi vot mili the
 In the 2007 assembly elections, BJP got 49 percent votes, but in 2012 it got 2 percent less votes and lost 2 seats
 jabaki congress ke vot fisadi main kisi tarah kii koi badhotaree nahin hui
 The Congress lagged behind the BJP with just 9 per cent of the votes

 But for this reason the cartoonist lost his job, which he himself revealed on Twitter
 canadai cartoonist maaikel di aidar ne rifuzi pita-beti kii tasviir viral hone ke baad ek cartoon banaaya
 In which the body of both the people lying on the lake was shown and a cartoon of the US President was shown near it
 jisamen donald trump golf cart ke saath khadey hai
 And asking the dead body of the father and daughter lying there, 'would you mind if i play here?' But in the past 2 weeks i drew 3 Trump cartoons
 2 went viral and the third went supernova and a day later i was let go
 And not only let go, the cartoons they already had in the can were not used
 Overnight it was like i never worked for the paper

 pehle worldcup kii tarah doosraa cricket worldcup bhi england main hua
 In 1979, eight teams participated in this World Cup
 is worldcup main bharat kaa pradarshan kaaphi niraashajanak tha, bharat koi bhi match jeet nahin paaya
 India played three matches in this World Cup and all the matches were lost
 pehla match west-indies se nau wicket se haara, doosraa match newzealand se aath wicket se or teesraa match srilanka 47 ran se haara
 The final match was played between England and the West Indies on 23 June at the Lord's on the splendid ground, it seemed that England would make history of winning the World Cup on their home ground, but defeating the best team like West Indies was not so easy
 west-indies ne shandaar khel kaa pradarshan karte hue england ko 92 ran se haraaya or duusari baar worldcup apane naam kiya
 England's dream of winning the World Cup broke
 gharelu darshakon ke saamne final main pahunchane ke babajood bhi england kitaab apane naam nahin kar paaya
 He received the title of "man of the Match" for his brilliant century by Vivian Richards
 teesraa world cap bhi england main hua

 India's team reached England under the captaincy of Kapil Dev
 us vaqt bharat kii team kaaphi kamjor maani jaati thi
 Where India had won only one match in the first World Cup, in the same way India could not win any match in the second World Cup
 england or west-indies jaisi shandaar tiimon ke saamne bharat kamjor nazar aa rahaa tha
 The West Indies had world class players such as Clive Lloyd, Vivian Richards, Malcolm Marshall
 lekin bharat kii kismat main kuch or likhaa hua tha
 India made a big upset in their first match
 tisare worldcup ke chauthe match main bharat ne west-indies ko 34 ran se haraakar sabko hairaan kar diya
 The legendary west-indies players were seen kneeling in front of India
 is jeet ke baad bharat ke khilaadiyon kaa manobal ooncha ho gaya
 Now India was not going to back down
 bharat apane chah lig maichon main se chaar match jitkar semi-final main pahunchaa
 India played their first semi-final match on 22 June 1983 in Manchester against a fantastic team like England
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki bharat haar jayega, lekin bharat ne kamaal kaa khel khelte hue england ko chah wicket se haraaya or final main pahunchaa
 Mohinder Amarnath's brilliant play earned him the "man of the Match" award
 west-indies bhi pakistan ko haraakar final main pahunch chukaa tha
 Now it was going to be real fun
 jahaan bharat ne is worldcup ke pehla match west-indies ko haraaya tha vahiin, duusare match main west-indies ne bharat ko haraakar badla le liya tha
 Now both teams were engaged in preparing for the victory of the third match
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki west-indies phir teesri baar worldcup kitaab jeet jayega or yah ummid or sahi lagane lagi jab bharat final match main sirf 183 ran par ol out ho gai
 But India was not going to give up
 saiyad kirmani jo final match main wicketiper ke rup main khele the, kehete hai ki bharat ke upar koi dabaav nahin tha
 It was a big thing for India to reach the final and the people of India were very happy

 haryana police kii ek or karatuut saamne ai he
 a woman is taken into the police station in custody during the night without any serious crime
 iske baad thane main 4-5 pulisavaalon kii maujuudagi main ek pulisavaala mahila ko belt se peethta he
 However, the law says that a woman cannot be kept in the police station during the night for questioning or arrest
 aaiye aapako ek kahani sunaate hai
 This story is about some policemen
 jo behad bahadur
 Are very prompt
 itane ki agar wo kisi mahila ko kisi ke saath park main ghoomte hue bhi dekh lete hai
 So let's get straight to the police station
 phir use kuch is tarah third degree torchar karte hai ki mahila ko bich main khadaa kar dete hai or saare pulisavaale uske ird gird khadey hokar use belt se peetane lagate the
 The police of Haryana's Faridabad will tell you the whole story
 darasal, is ghatana kaa video viral ho gaya
 Which was made by a policeman
 usamen dekha ja saktaa he ki kaise mahila ko third degree torchar diya gaya
 The video is of Adarsh nagar police station in Ballabgarh in Faridabad
 naam adarsh nagar kaa thana he
 But this is not at all an idiot
 5 se 6 police vaale ek mahila kii belt se pitayee karte dikh rahe hai
 Not only this, but are laughing at the fun
 maanon mahila ko petakar ye apana time paas kar rahe hai
 Policemen are angry with the woman
 sutron se pataa chalaa he ki ye mahila park main apane kisi saathi ke saath raat ke vakt main gum rahi thi
 Only then is the police caught patrolling it
 mahila kaa saathi to bhaag gaya, magar mahila ko un police waalon ne jabaran pakad liya
 Then what was there
 pulisavaale tamaam kaayade kanoonon ko taakh par rakhkar raat ke vakt mahila ko thane le aae or usase lagaataar teen ghante yaa phir usase bhi zyaada der tak poochtacha karte rahe
 They kept asking for his partner's number
 viral video main dekha ja saktaa he ki pulisavaale bol rahe hai ki teen ghante se ghuma rahi he
 The woman says that i will tell the number, do not hit me
 is dauraan ek police vaala belt se use pite ja rahaa he
 The policeman is asking whether i should lay it down
 khilaadi he ye puri ek number kii khilaadi
 When this crime was going on in front of everyone in the police station, one of these policemen was also making a hidden video
 vahi video ab viral ho rahaa he
 It is being told that this video of Adarsh nagar police station of Ballabhgarh is months old
 lekin viral 26 may ke aas-paas hona bataaya ja rahaa he
 According to what was understood after watching the video for about 4 minutes, this woman is being beaten up by policemen for sitting in the park
 jabaki aisa kuch bhi gair-kanoonee nahin
 For which a woman should be picked up and brought to the police station
 aasaan shikaar dekhakar puraa police thana apane dimag kii bhabhakati frestrishan us aurat par utaar de
 But the police in our country operates according to their manual, not law
 or un pulisavaalon kaa minial sikhaata he ki agar der raat park main akeli aurat dikh gai to ye mauqaa kisi haal main chhodana nahin chahie
 The good news of law and vanity can fly
 mahilaon ko lekar kya he kanoonmahila se poochtacha yaa giraftaar ko lekar kanoon kahata he ki kisi bhi mahila ko shaam chah baje ke baad or subah chah baje ke pehle giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 She can be house-arrested, but only the woman police can do that
 din dhalane ke baad mahila se poochtacha karnaa he to police ko hi uske ghar janaa hoga
 a woman policeman can investigate a woman
 koi purush pulicekarmi use haath nahin laga saktaa
 Police cannot even handcuff a woman without a court order
 agar koi medical jaanch honi he to mahila apane kisi vishwaasapaatr ko apane saath rakh sakati he
 After the arrest, it is necessary to have a female police officer in the police station where the woman is being taken
 / p>ye to haalanki kanoon ke niyam kaayade hai
 But here it has been what has been happening for centuries
 ek kamazor mahila he or taaqatvar police thana he
 And there are some dull policemen inside
 ek ke haath main belt he
 Which he is desperate to shower on a woman
 or rah rahakar apane third degree dimaag kaa muzahra pesh kar rahaa he
 The entire police station together is trying to remind the woman her partner's mobile number
 mahila baar-baar koshish kar rahi he lekin das ank kaa mobile number nahin bataa paa rahi he
 a policeman is also threatening to litter him repeatedly
 matlab agar belt kii dhunaai se baat nahin bani to use lita kar maaraa jayega
 Have you been killed? wo is video main nahin he
 Because the video is only four minutes and a few seconds
 wo to ganimat he ki ye video kahin se li ho gaya
 The police was thrashed
 ection to lenaa hi tha
 So 5 people of Adarsh nagar Police Station were found guilty
 do head consteble suspend hue hai
 And three spos have been dismissed
 jahaan ye sara parpanch chal rahaa tha
 There was also a women's police station just 100 meters from that Adarsh nagar police station
 yani yahi poochtacha mahila pulicekarmi bhi kar sakati thim
 But this question is meaningless why they were not given the news
 baharhaal video saamne aa chukaa he
 Action has also been taken
 aage jaanch chal rahi he
 But the question is how many more videos will there be of such dreadful police nights
 jo ab tak li nahin hue
 And even today hunting in the parks will continue
 police waalon ko kaanoon kii bhashaa samajni samjaani chahie
 This will make the life of women and girls sitting in the parks late nights easier
 or ab waapas aate hai us kahani par jahaan se hamane shuruuaat kii thi
 So by now, if you have understood the story, then explain to your children and children that the police uncles are not that good either
 jitna unhen kitabon main padhaaye jate hai
 So advise them to think several times before playing or sitting in the park
 baaki sab thik he

 After working on its story for a year, he contacted Aamir via e-mail
 aamir ne puri script padhne kii ichha jaahir kii haalanki bich main baatcheet kaa silsilaa tham gaya lekin antat: aamir is film ko produs karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 It took Anusha and her team six years to make the entire film
 film kii adhikansh shooting madhya pradesh ke badvaai gaanv main hui he
 Today, amidst the debate on inflation in the country, the popular song of the film 'dearness witch eaten' is mentioned in Rajya Sabha to political parties and media have also been involved in the discussion
 is bare main bakaul anushaa ‘mahangaai dian’ lokapriy hota ja rahaa he, lekin vah film main is samasya kaa koi samaadhaan pesh karne kaa daawa nahin karti
 He said that the film is a story of debt-ridden farmers with Raghuveer Yadav as Budhia in addition to Natha in the main characters
 film ko relies se pehle haal hi main durban film mahotsav main sarvshereshth feechar film ke puraskaar se nawaja gaya he
 About this, Anusha said, "being the first film, it was not expected
 yah bilkul chappar fadkar milane jaisaa he jo 150 logon kii puri team kii mehnat kaa nateeja he
 "he said," i did not even know that our film was selected in any category of this film festival
 pehle aamir ko pataa chalaa or unhone mujhe phone karke bataaya
 "anusha said that the background score of the film has been prepared by the famous French composer Mathias Duplessi, who has taken his own interest for it and has himself given tunes from many Indian instruments

 After that, we will consider the plan ahead

 kargil yuddh main bharat ne 26 july ko vijay hasil kii thi
 In this war which lasted for about two months, the Pakistani Army and the intruder had to kneel in front of the courage and valor of the Indian Army
 kargil main kareeb 18 hajaar feet par ladi gai is jang main desh ne 500 se zyada vir javaanon ko khoyaa tha or 1300 se zyada ghayal hue the
 The people of India are still proud of the martyrdom of heroes
 is yuddh ne hamen kai sabak die
 Today, 20 years after the Kargil War, the situation has changed completely
 bhartiya sena 1999 kii galatiyon se sabak lete hue ab puri tarah se mustaid he
 Pakistanis can no longer infiltrate the Indian border as before
 ham aapako bataate hai ki kargil yudd ke 20 saal baad kaise badal gai he paristhityaan or kisi he bharat kii taiyaari
 How is India's preparation? Like 1999, there is no possibility of Pakistani infiltration and war in Kargil
 pakistani jahaan se ghuspaith karte the use dhundha ja chukaa he or vahaan unase nipatane ke liye counter ghuspaith grid banaae gaye hai
 Army deployment in those areas of Kargil has increased threefold
 sardi ke mausam main ab post ko khaali nahin choda jaataa he
 Several helipads have been built on the Line of Control (loc)
 sena ne vahaan ayuddh centre banaae hai or vahaan bade paimaane par yuddh saamagree rakhi gai he
 After the Kargil War, a committee was formed for review
 isaki report ke baad kargil ke un ilaakon main buniyadi dhaancha ko durust kiya gaya he
 Roads and monitoring centers have been built there
 elosi par pakistan kii hallsegar ham pakistan kii sthiti par gaur farmaaen to elosi ke paar unke bunker kii haalat kharaab he
 Most of them do not even have cement on the bunker
 unki haalat dekhakar lagata he ki pakistani sena ke paas fund kii dikkat he
 They lack ration
 pakistani sena ke paas gaadi kii kami dikhti he
 However, they have helicopters
 aise main ab 1999 jaisi sthiti to kabhi bhi nahin paidaa ho sakati
 There is no longer any threat from Pakistan in Kargil
 1999 main kyon hui pakistani ghuspaithyudd ke pehle kargil main elosi ke paas bhartiya sena kaa keval ek brigade tha
 It had about 2,500 soldiers deployed in three units
 elosi par jojila or leh ke bich kareeb 300 kilometre kii seemaa kii suraksha kaa jimmaa inke upar tha
 This sector is important for the deployment of material and troops from Zojila to Siachen but its importance was not understood before the infiltration
 yahaan kai guna zyada sainikon kii tainaati kii jarurat thi, lekin tab ise nahin samajha gaya tha
 In winter the post on the mountain peaks on the loc was evacuated
 in ilaakon main sadakon kii kami thi or kuch sadakon par gaadi jane kii sthiti nahin thi
 War materials and surveillance techniques were also lacking
 in kamiyon kaa phayda uthaakar pakistan ne ghuspaith kii thi
 Now these shortcomings have been completely rectified
 aise main kargil main pakistan ab bilkul ghuspaith nahin kar saktaa

 yachika main puraskaar waapas lene ke liye desh ke sarvocch naagarik sammaan ke kathith galat istemaal ko aadhaar banaaya gaya tha
 a bench of justices Dipak Misra and DY Chandrachud said that there are no statutory provisions, rules and laws to deal with the allegations leveled against Tendulkar
 yachikakarta wike naswa ne aarope lagaaya ki kai lekhakon ne apni kitabon main tendulkar kaa zikr bharat ratna ke rup main kiya he or unhone apni kitaab kaa shishark bhi isi tareeke se rakhaa he
 The petitioner also alleged that even after being awarded the award, Tendulkar continued to participate in business activities
 peeth ne kaha ki agar tendulkar ne kitaab likhi hoti or usamen ‘bharat ratna’ shabd ko joda hota to maamla alag hota lekin jab koi teesraa paksh kitaab likh rahaa he to unhen javabdeh nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 The comments peeth ne yachika khaarij karte hue kaha, ‘‘agar prativaadee number do ‘bharat ratna’ shabd kaa istemaal karte hue kitaab likhata jo maamla alag hota
 When a third party is writing a book, there is no doubt in our mind that defendant number two cannot be held accountable

 Yachikakar VK Naswa alleged that many authors have mentioned Tendulkar as Bharat Ratna in their books and they have put the title of their book in the same manner
 yachikakarta ne saath hi aarope lagaaya ki puraskaar se sammanit kiye jane ke baad bhi tendulkar ne vyavsaayik gatividhiyon main hissaa lenaa jari rakhaa
 The bench said that if Tendulkar had written the book and added the word 'bharat Ratna' to it, then the matter would have been different but when a third party is writing the book then he cannot be held accountable
 tippaniyan The bench dismissed the petition, saying, "if the defendant number two would have written the book using the word 'bharat Ratna', the case would have been different
" jab koi teesraa paksh kitaab likh rahaa he to hamaare dimag main koi andeh nahin he ki prativaadee number do ko javabdeh nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Naswa, in his petition, challenged the Madhya Pradesh High Court order dated August 10, 2015, through which the yachika relating to Tendulkar's alleged misuse of Bharat Ratna award was dismissed without any order

 vivaadit dhaanche ke paas chabutare par mandir banane kii sarkaar se anumati nahin milane ke baad kanoonee rasta akhriyaar karte hue das ne 1885 main faijabad adaalat main divaani yachika daayar kii
 But this petition was dismissed on the grounds that the incident (the alleged demolition of the original Ram temple in 1528) took place some 350 years ago and has been so delayed that the complaint cannot be resolved now
 faijabad adaalat ne yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa aadesh diya
 After this the matter remained dormant for nearly six decades and in 1950 the matter came up again
 23 disambar 1949 ko ek praathmiki darj kar aarope lagaaya gaya ki kareeb 50 logon ne dhaanche kaa taala tod diya or vahaan ram tathaa anya hindu devataaon kii pratimaayein sthapit kar deen

 He demanded a ban on the removal of idols
 iske saath hi unhone puja or darshan jari rakhane kii bhi maang kii
 An interim judgment of the court, which came on 26 April 1955, said that the idols should be left there
 varsh 1959 main 17 disambar ko nirmohi akhaada bhi vivaad main shaamil ho gaya tathaa usne teesraa vaad daayar kiya
 He filed a case against the Uttar Pradesh government and the receiver, demanding that the property be handed over to him
 iske do saal baad 18 disambar 1961 ko sunni central vakf board bhi vivaad main shaamil ho gaya or usne dhaanche ko masjid ghoshit karne, aasapaas kii bhoomi uske supurd kiye jane or vahaan se murtiyon tathaa anya saamaan hataae jane kii maang kii
 Later in 1964 all the promises were merged together
 varsh 1984 main is mudde ne raajnneetik rup le liya or vishwa hindu parishad ne vivaadit sthal par ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye abhiyaan shuru kiya
 In 1986, the VHP formed the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, while Muslim leaders established the Babri Masjid Action Committee
 16 disambar 1987 ko uttar pradesh sarkaar ne sabhi yachikaaon ko faijabad adaalat se elahabaad ucch nyaayalay sthanantarit karne kii maang kii
 The High Court then prevented political parties from disturbing the status quo at the disputed site
 25 aktubar 1989 ko adaalat ne pradesh sarkaar ko dhaanche ke paas kii bhoomi apane kabje main lene kii anumati di
 But, 2 later near the disputed structure on the appeal of Muslim leaders
 77 acre bhoomi ke adhigrahan ko khaarij karte hue sthaayee nirmaan par roak laga di
 In another development, the then government on 10 November 1989 2
 77 acre bhoomi ke baahar shilanyas kii vihip ko anumati di
 The Supreme Court on November 27, 1992, on the assurance of the BJP government of Kalyan Singh, allowed symbolic car service

 On the completion of six months of the Narendra Modi government, the opposition party Congress has released a booklet 'U Turn Government' on Monday
 congress netaa ajay maakan ne bocolate jari karte hue kaha ki modi sarkaar apane 180 dinon ke kaarykaal main kul 25 baar vaade se palati he
 That is, every week the government is overturned by one of its promises, which is sheer deception of the public
 congress netaa ne kaha ki bijepi ne vot batorne ke liye janata ko jhuthe sapane dikhaae or ab sapanom ko todane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Making the issue of black money in the booklet, the Congress said that the government had promised that it would bring back the black money within 100 days, but the money was not returned yet
 dukhad to yah he ki ab sarkaar ke mantri or netaa aisi kisi dedline kii baat ko maanane ke liye bhi taiyaar nahin hai
 While Rajnath Singh himself talked about the return of black money in 100 days
 congress kaa aarope he ki bijepi netaa pehle jahaan khule taur par videshon main kaledhan kii rakam ke aankadon kaa bakhaan karte the, vahiin ab khud pradhanmantri 'man kii baat' main kehete hai ki unhen nahin pataa videshi bank khaaton main kitna kalaadhan he
 Whereas Nitin Gadkari had said that there is 21 lakh crores black money abroad
 yahaan tak ki sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha tha ki paisa vaapasi par sabhi ko 15 lakh rupee bhi milenge
 Other allegations of Congress on BJP government * BJP making ceasefire by Pakistan and presence of China in Indian border pre-election issue, after formation of government is silent on the issue
 yahi nahin, is dauraan sarkaar raksha mantralay ke liye ek sthai mantri tak nahin bana pai
 * Pre-election government opposed Nandan Nilekani and Aadhaar card, while now it is supporting it
 * bijepi ne ensipi ko maharashtra kii sabase bhrasht party bataaya, jabaki vidhansabha chunaav ke baad khud usase gathbandhan kii jugat main jute gai
 * BJP, which talked about providing relief to the people affected by inflation, increased the rail fare immediately after coming to power
 * sarkaar ne kisaanon ko samarthan mulya main koi raahat nahin di
 * Many tainted ministers in the BJP government's cabinet talking of clean cabinet and clean government
 * kabhi dijal keemton ke diregulation kaa virodh karne vaali party ab use aage lekar bad rahi he
 * Modi government has not yet appointed CIC and CVC
 * peepi raav ko lokapal niyukt karne ke kram main bhi sarkaar kii haa or naa kaa chalan dikhaa
 * For the assembly elections in Delhi, the BJP government was seen doing everything
 * dhara 370 ke mudde par bijepi sarkaar 180 degree ke angel ke saath sidhe palat gai
 * There are now 66 ministers in the Modi government talking about maximum governance
 * baba ramdev ke suzav par modi sarkaar ne 1000 rupee ke note ko band karne kaa faisla kiya, lekin nepal jaakar pradhanmantri ne 1000 rupee ke note ko lekar samjhaute par hastakshar kiya

 8 tivrata vaale bukamp ke tej jhatkon se hill gaye
 This earthquake of high intensity reminded the devastation that occurred in Nepal last year, in which more than 8000 people lost their lives
 25 april kii us ghatana ko yaad karen to usne nepal ke ek itihaas ko chand second main dharashayi kar diya tha
 The 19th-century nine-storey Dharahara Tower was completely torn down by the terrible earthquake in Nepal last year
 1832 kaa main bana yah tower bukamp ke bhayanak jhatkon ke baad matiamet ho gaya
 'so special was the Dharhara Tower'
 This tower, built in 1832 by Bhimsen Thapa, the first Prime Minister of Nepal, was an iconic monument
 iskaa nirmaan ek sainya nigaraanee tower ke rup main kiya gaya tha, jo baad main kathmandu kaa ek mukhya aitihaasik sthal ban gaya
 It is said that it was called 'qutub Minar' of Nepal
 dharhara ko 10 saal pehle hi paryatakon ke liye kholaa gaya tha
 See in the pictures: delhi-ncr was shaken even before the earthquake was shaken to death on Earth
 9 magnitude vaale bukamp se nepal main har taraf maut or matam kaa manjar pasar gaya tha
 More than 8000 people died in this terrible natural disaster
 is tabaahi ke baad nepal main lakhon log beghar ho gaye the
 
 bharat main 3 din main doosraa jhatkauttar bharat, afghanistan or pakistan main ravivaar shaam ko bhi bukamp ke tej jatke mahasoos kiye gaye the

 Milk, fruits and vegetables will be expensive due to the increase in the price of diesel, as well as all those things which are connected to everyday
 dijal ke daam badhane se ab maal dhulaai kii keemat badhengi
 If the rate of freight increases, vegetables will be expensive and milk prices will also increase
 maal dhulaai ke dar main badhotaree kaa asar to fal or anaaj par bhi dikhegaa
 The increase in diesel prices will also affect farmers and laborers
 dijal mashin se sinchai mahangi ho jaaegi
 Towing the farm with the tractor will also become expensive
 rojaanaa skool, offis jane waalon kaa bas kaa kiraaya bhi mahangaa ho jayega
 It has started showing its effect in various cities of the country
 dijal kii keemton main badhotaree ke saath hi navi mumbai main maal bhaade main badhotaree kaa elaan kar diya gaya he
 Not only this, the side effects of increasing diesel prices will also be seen on the amenities of the people
 dijal taxi kaa kiraaya mahangaa hoga, lihaaja ghoomana phirana mahangaa ho jayega
 The cost of diesel powered generators will increase, so power backup will become expensive
 sarkaar to ye kahkar apana pallaa jhaad legi ki usne to dijal ke daam sirf paanch rupee badaye hai
 But how much will this ruin of five rupees inflict on the common people, it will be known only in the coming days
 gas sabsidi khatm karne kaa asarek parivaar main har maheene ausatan ek silendar kaa kharch he
 That means 12 cylinders in twelve months
 ab agar 6 silendar ke baad sabsidi khatm ho jayega to saatven silendar se har silendar par kam se kam 350 rupee zyada chukaane honge
 This means that for the remaining 6 cylinders, you will have to pay Rs 2100 more
 desh kii sarkaar ke liye 2100 rupee myne nahin rakhte honge
 But one month's ration of common people can come to 2100 rupees
 har baar mahangaai badhati he, log behaal hote hai

" mamata iske baad ekajute congress kii adhyaksh bane

 'after witnessing Goa and Kashmir, i feel that nation's democracy will weaken if we are left with BJP as a single party

 khud ko maamle kaa visal blower bataate hue chouhan ne kaha ki hycourt kii nigaraanee main chal rahi maamle kii jaanch sibiai jaanch se behatar he
 Here are select portions of the conversation: First your minister went to jail, then FIR was filed against your PA and now your wife Sadhna Singh is being accused, after all what is happening in the Vyapam scam under your rule? There is no relation at all
 jab congress ke saare waar khaali chale gaye to meri patni ke peeche pad gaye
 Is it a crime to be the wife of the Chief Minister? If a minor spokesperson of a party will bring a piece of paper, they will accept it all
 But what is the coincidence of the recruitment of 13 people of Sadhna ji in the measurement department? It is a coincidence that the first thing is impossible It is not that many meritorious people from a district or village are selected simultaneously in an examination
 lekin yahaan to yah sanyog bhi nahin hua he
 The fact that Gondia people are selected is completely misleading
 pataa nahin media main is tarah kaa bhraamak samachar kaise chal rahaa he
 This is absolutely windy
 piessi main apni bhatiji ke chayan main dhaandhlee par aap kya kahenge?piessi kii pariksha ke bare main saare tathy khud madhya pradesh lok seva ayog ne spasht kar die hai
 Every thing has become clear like a glass
 pisies-2008 kii pariksha puri tarah paardarshee he, isamen koi vivaad hi nahin he
 Despite this, if people give false propaganda, then i cannot catch anyone's face
 lekin saarvajanik jivan main kisi eemaandaar vyakti kii chhavi is tarah kharaab karnaa sadacharan nahin mana ja saktaa
 But the scam has been happening since 2008 in admission to PMT
 2011 main aap vidhansabha main kehete hai ki pariksha or paardarrshi banaai jaaegi, lekin 2012 or 2013 main farji admician kii sankhya kai guna bad jaati he
 Don't you take laxity in stopping the scam? You know, i am the first person to catch the Vyapam scam
 mujhe indore police se gopneey soochna mili thi, ki do chaatr kisi duusare chaatr kii jagah pariksha dene ke maamle main sandigdh hai or is maamle main kai anya logon ke shaamil hone kaa andeh he
 i immediately ordered a detailed investigation into the case
 tab tak to kisi ko is maamle ke bare main pataa bhi nahin tha
 i am the one to bring the Vyapam scam to the world
 aap chahen to mujhe hi visal blower maan lijie
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, i formed the Special Task Force (STF) for investigation and handed over the command of the STF to the ADG of an honest image
 bade paimaane par giraftaaryaan huin
 But the scam continued
 mere kaarykaal main 3,58,000 niyuktiyaan kii gayi, inamen se 228 niyuktiyaan sandigdh pai gayi
 All these recruitments were canceled
 lakhon bhartiyon main se 200 bhartiyon agar sandigdh ho jaaen or un par bhi karrwai ho jaae to ise mahaghotaale kaa naam diya jayega? yahaan to ghotaalaa bhi nahin he
 Only 299 medical admission suspects were found
 inke bhi pravesh nirast kar die gaye
 If it is not a scam then tell me why did physical examinations in police recruitment be removed? This was the game of Congress era
 kisi ke seene kii naap galat le lee, kisi kii lambii yaa oonchi kud kii maap badal lee
 The SP level officer is under examination and transparency is completely missing

 indore ke charchit bhayyuji maharaj aatmahatya maamle se indore police ne pardaa uthaa diya he
 But do you know that in this case the police would have remained empty handed if it had not started linking with a phone call
 indore range ke diaiji harinarayanchari mishra ne ajtak se baat karte hue bataaya ki kaise ek phone kol ne bhayyuji maharaj aatmahatya maamle main chal rahi puri investigeshan ko nai disha de di
 DIG Harinarayanachari Mishra said that the police investigation was going on that one day a call was received from the lawyer associated with the trust asking for a ransom of Rs 5 crore
 hamaare paas shikaayat ai or hamane us nambar ko servilans par lekar nigaraanee shuru kar di
 Within a few days, we reached a driver of Bhagyuji Maharaj through that number, who gave many such information in the inquiry which was completely different from the ongoing investigation
 diaiji mishra ke mutabik driver ne bataaya ki bhayyuji kii aatmahatya ke kuch dinon baad se hi parivaar ke logon ke bich talkhiyaan bad gayi or sevadaaron ke bich bhi jhagade hone lage the
 On the basis of the statement of the driver, Indore police questioned a total of 125 people at different places and official statements of 28 people were recorded
 diaiji ke mutabik sab bayanon or digital avidence yani phone kol ricards, puraani chats ko jab joda gaya to saboot milte chale gaye or unke aadhaar par sevadaar vinayak, sharad or palak ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 According to the police, they had screenshots of objectionable chats, under the guise of which they were blackmailing Bhagyuji
 police ne bataaya ki pakade gaye logon main palak naam kii yuvati bhi shaamil he
 She has been the secretary of Bhagyuji in the past and was constantly pressurizing Bhayuji for marriage
 shaadi naa hone par police karrwai kii dhamkee bhi de rahi thi
 During interrogation of the police, it came to know that they also collected money from Bhayuji many times in the guise of this, due to which Bhayuji was under great mental stress
 baharhaal police ne teenon aropiyon ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya he, lekin jis tarah se aatmahatya maamle main bhayyuji ke sabase khaas sevadaar vinayak kaa naam aayaa he usne sabko hairaan zarur kar diya he
 Let us tell you that Bhayuji Maharaj committed suicide by shooting himself in the month of June 2018
 unki maut ke baad maukey se mili suicide note main unhone tanaav ke kaaran yah kadam uthaane kaa zikr kiya tha

 From input language narendra modi sarkaar ke sansad main pehle purna bajet satr ke madhyavkaash se thik pehle vipaksh nai urja ke saath ubharta dikhaai de rahaa he
 After the incredible mandate given to the BJP in 2014, the opposition seems shocked and shocked, now it is recovering from it
 jis tarah sonia gandhi ne tivi camaron kii khatir raashtrapati bhawan tak paidal kooch karte hue bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak main bijepi ke sanshodhano ke khilaaf vipaksh ke pradarshan kii aguai kii, thik usee tarah is saal ke india today conklev ke kai satron main asahmati kii bhaavana purajor goonjati sunai di
 This once again cemented the strength and strength of India's magnificent democracy
 dilli main taj pales hotel ke baahar or bheetar do dhur rajnatik virdohi trinmul congress ke derek o'bryan or sipii (em) ke mohammad saleem koyale ke mudde par bijepi kii khinchaai karne ke liye ek saath aa gaye
 In the session on the topic "the Decenters: Size Decent Matter", Congress's Jyotiraditya Scindia said that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was so generous that during the UPA rule, he was allowed to openly express disagreements and differences in cabinet meetings quite a lot and There was open debate in every case
 lekin jab unase poocha gaya ki do din pehle cabinet kii baithak main manjuur, sajaa paae saansadon-vidhayakon ko bachaane vaale adhyadesh ko 27 sitambar, 2013 ko faad dene vaale rahul gandhi awwal darje ke virdohi the yaa party ke pehle vaaris, to sindhiya idhar-udhar kii baaten karte hue baglein jhaankne lage
 Sasadhiya was forced to believe that her party could not live up to the expectations of crores of people in the country and Rahul would have to do something in the next few months to win the trust of the people
 lekin kya karnaa padegaa? is sawaal par kagress netaa ngkshasdhiya bahut karine se kataraakar nikal gaye
 Political leaders of almost all parties, with their spot-and-sarcasm and humor, not only captivated the hearts of the people in the Conclave, but also brought back memories of the old days of debate in Parliament
 misaal dekhie: 'mohamsamad saleem ne kaha, agar derek (oibrayan) logon or trinmul congress kii pramukh mamata (banerjee) donon ko ek saath sadhana chaahate hai, to yah ho nahin saktaa
 Similarly, the conductor of a session told bjp's Balbir Punj that Arvind Kejriwal should send a blank note to Rahul that he allowed his party to disintegrate so much that his entire vote bank in the recent Delhi elections was common man
 Went towards the party
 to punj ne chahakate hue jawaab diya, "yah to khayr kejariwal ke upar he, lekin pehle unhen pataa lagaana padegaa ki rahul gandhi philhal hai kahaan
 Otherwise, the address of the courier will be returned by writing
 "beshak, hansi-majaak ke saath-saath behad sanjeeda tark -vitark bhi hue
 One of these debates was about the right to be discrete, referring to the right to eat or not to eat one or the other variety of things
 vaaki kai tarah ke pakwaanon vaale is desh main bail, baiylgaadee or gaay ke bich lakeer bhala koi kaise khinche? derek o'bryan ne kaha ki maharashtra main-or haal hi main haryana main-gomance khaane par jurmaana yon utpeedan par jurmaane se zyada he
 However, he admitted that sending a cartoonist to jail at the beginning of Mamata Banerjee's tenure in West Bengal was unfortunate and should not have happened
 jahaan tak sansad ke bajet satr main rahul kii gaiyr-maujuudagi par tanj kasne kii baat he, to yah ek tarah se swaabhaavik hi tha
 But it made one thing clear: what happened to the Congress at the hands of Modi that it has become easier for Indians to laugh at Rahul's plans to democratize this 129-year-old party from the ground up
 in dinon ve sansad se maheene bhar lambii chuttee par chale gaye hai
 So, are they too busy planning the plans to make the party more democratic? Almost everyone in the Conclave criticized that Modi's freedom to speak and express in a molded party is such a missing It is as if someone tries to forget their old bad habits
 punj bhala yah kyon maanane vaale the
 Even when it was said that putting senior leaders like LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi in the upper floor of the name Bhavak Mandir Mandal is not an example to confirm this
 
 
 punj ne kaha, yah pushti karne vaala udhaaharan nahin, balki anushaasan he, jo party ke har kisi vyakti par lagu hota he
 Punj then plunged directly into the tricky debate of nationalism-patriotism-superstition and argued that in January, Greenpeace activist Priya Pillai was on a flight to London when she was going to address British mps, Delhi Airport The airport was airlifted and the government should take such steps
 punj ne kaha, ''agar adivaasiyon kii sachhee samasyaayein aapke paas hai, to hamen bataaie, british saansadon ke paas jane or unhen samajhane se bhala kya hasil hoga?''beshak usee din baad main mukhyamantriyon ke satr main yah dekhnaa dilachasp tha ki ek bhi mukhyamantri, yahaan tak ki bijepi kii hukumat vaale rajyon ke mukhyamantri bhi, is had tak jane ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 Devendra Fadnavis, Raman Singh and Manoharlal Khattar all admitted that Modi was their only supreme leader and that they were natural contenders to lead Team India
 lekin saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki desh ko samgr taur par dishanirdesh dena dilli kaa adhikaar he, magar apane-apane rajya kaa netaa hone ke naate apni jarurat ke hisaab se nitiyaan bananaa unka visheshadhikaar he or yah adhikaar unke paas har haal main rahanaa chahie
 Anyone would be surprised that somewhere behind this, the centuries old saying "hanuj Delhi is far away" (delhi is still far away) is not working
 lagata he, bijepi ke tamaam mukhyamantri, chaahe ve aresas ke kattar sadsy hi kyon na hon, satta kii rajdhani se jitne zyada dur hai, utani hi zyada aazaadee se kaam kar paa rahe hai
 For instance, Raman Singh has put a glut of facts and figures and told him that Chhattisgarh has emerged as a major state on the map of the country and is making steady progress
 ishaaron-ishaaron main ve kah rahe the ki jaruri nahin, gujarat hi number ek rajya ho
 He said this in response to the question, which was repeatedly asked by Headlines Today consulting editor Rajdeep Sardesai
 raman singh shaayad apane shrotaaon ko aahiste se yaad dilaa rahe the ki narendra modi kii tarah ve bhi teen baar apane rajya ke mukhyamantri chune ja chuke hai, or matra tathaa shishu mrityu dar sahit kai morchon par chhattisgarh kii uplabdhiyaan gujarat se bilashak behatar hai
 That is, their achievements can not be said at all
 haryana ke mukhyamantri khatter or maharashtra ke mukhyamantri fadanvis raman singh kii tarah chatur sujan nahin the
 What did Fadnavis actually get stuck in the statue of Shivaji's statue that he could not get out of
 khaskar jab mahaan maratha yoddhaon ke samaran chihn na sirf mumbai balki puure rajya main bikhare pade hai; or khaskar jab ek tikaoo yaa udaar aarthik niti ke abhaav main vidarbha ke kisaanon kii khudakushi kaa silsilaa jari he, aise main yah baat maujuud logon main kisi ko bhi ratti bhar raas nahin ai ki nayaa maharashtra shivaji kii pratimaa par karodon rupye mahaj isliye kharch kare ki ek din vah arab mahaasaagar ke bich se ubhartee dikhaai degi
 However, on this occasion no one reminded me of the statue of Sardar Patel which will one day emerge in Gujarat and which is imagined by Modi himself
 jahaan tak uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri harish ravat kii baat he, unhone is puraani kahawat kii taraf ishaara kiya ki jaruri nahin ki acha ganit acchhee sisaayat bhi hoh isamen koi shaq nahin ki rajyon ko pehle kii tulana main karon kaa zyada hissaa 32 fisadi se badhkar 42 fisadi-mil rahaa he, lekin hakeekat yah he ki centre pryojit yojanaon ko khatm kar dene se rajyon ko ghaataa hua he, kyonki puraane achche dinon main in yojanaon kaa matlab hota tha acchhee-khaasi rakam
 Not only this, neither Modi nor anyone else from the Center consulted the states before implementing this scheme or other schemes
 ravat ke yah baat kehete hi bechaini bhari khamoshi chaa gai
 It seemed that there was something really wrong
 alabatta ravat kii shakchisyat main ek kism kaa itmeenaan dikhaai detaa he, maano unke man main yah baat ghar kar gai he ki unke rajya uttarakhand main bijepi ke prati lagaav or samarthan bad rahaa he
 How Manish Sisodia acquitted himself and got him released? It seems that the Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi has blindly kept the record of ending the long-standing corruption of the party on behalf of his party's continuing infighting and in response to every question with the same spirit, he said that he Will finish lekin jaise hi unhen centre sarkaar par hamalaa bolne kii thodi-si gunjaaish mili, unhone use chhodana katai gavaara nahin kiya
 As the representative of Kejriwal in the Conclave, he said, "the Center dictates in Delhi
 isliye dilli (rajya sarkaar) dilli (centre) kii gulam he
 Overall, the Conclave's dialogues were reflective of the sentiments and emotions of their time
 or vakt kaa takaza yah he ki agar bijepi bharat par hukumat karnaa chaahati he or yahaan tak ki bhavishya kii chadar par apni viraasat kii chhap chhodia chaahati he, to use yah baat manani hi hogi ki bharat vividhtaon kaa desh he
 He will also have to agree that disagreement is another name for one or many other attitudes, which will not only have to be tolerated, but also given space
 pradhanmantri modi or bijepi yah baat samajhate hai yaa nahin, koi nahin jaanata
 Especially in mid-february, barely a month after the Prime Minister's thunderous proclamation about the "unity in diversity" in Delhi's syro-malabar Church, the way the church was demolished in Hisar, Haryana, this question The silence has become more dense
 alabatta aakhri pate kii baat derek o'bryan ne kahi
 After vigorously defending the right of resistance, he finally said in a mysterious manner that if the BJP did not understand the mood of the country, the rest of the country would be mobilized against the BJP
 haal hi main dilli vidhansabha ke chunaav main bijepi ke safaaye kii taraf ishaara karte hue o'bryan ne kaha, ''67-3, meri baat likh len
 The next number is from Bihar
 '' Team India have cut the Champions Trophy semi-final ticket after winning a stunning 8-wicket win against the West Indies
 bharat kii is jeet main rabindra jadeja or shikhar dhawan ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Jadeja showed his spin on the pitch of the Oval, which was helpful to the fast bowlers, while the bat of century Shavir Dhawan once again roared
 dhoni ke dhurandharon ne ek baar phir yah dikhaaya ki maidan ke baahar bhale hi team vivaadon main fansi ho par iskaa asar unki khel par nahin pad rahaa
 By the way, there were many reasons for this spectacular victory of Team India
 'shikhar' par hai dhawansalaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan apni jindagi ke sabase behtareen form main hai
 They are not missing an opportunity to cash in on this form
 gharelu cricket main ranon kaa ambara lagane ke baavjood shuruaati dinon main team main jagah banane main naakaam rahane vaale dhawan ab mili is maukey ko haath se nahin jane dena chaahate
 Dhawan hit a century in the second consecutive match to prove that the team has got the option of Gambhir or Sehwag
 shikhar ne windies ke khilaaf 107 gendon main naabad 102 ran banaae
 During this time, he hit 10 fours and 1 six
 unki ballebaaji kii sabase badi khaasiyat yah thi ki pari ke dauraan unhone team par kabhi ran rate kaa dabaav nahin banane diya
 At the same time, a good start turned into a big score, and only after winning the semi-final ticket to the team, they stole
 'rockstar' jadeja kaa kamalkya vaaki main england ke pich tej gendbaajon ke liye madadgaar hote hai
 You would think the same by seeing Ravindra Jadeja's performance against the West Indies
 jadeja ne gend se apane vanade kariyar kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan karte hue cote ke 10 overon main 36 ran dekar 5 wicket jatke
 Of these 36 runs, he looted 14 in his last over
 darasal, jadeja ne apni phiraki se westeindies ke ballebaajon ko jhakzor kar rakh diya
 The Caribbean batsmen did not have the answer to Jadeja's bowling, despite understanding the pitch as a good start
 jadejaca phiraki ke aage westeindies ke madhyakram ballebaaj 'aayaa ram
 
 
 
 gaya ram'hone ke liemajaboor ho gaye
 Due to this, the Windies were able to score 233 runs losing 9 wickets in the prescribed 50 overs
 'kool' he hamaara captain dhonibhale hi maidan ke baahar dhoni ek sports form main hissedari ko lekar vivaadon main fanse hon par jab maamla team kii netritv kaa hota he to maahi kii ranneeti ke aage virdohi ghutane techne ko majaboor ho jate hai
 The way Dhoni used the bowlers and fielders in the match against the West Indies was commendable
 dhoniko ranneeti ko amal karne main madad toss jeetne se bhi mili
 The mood of the season and the pitch was earlier suited to bowling
 dhoni ne ek kshan nahin ganvaaya or pehle kshetrarakshan karne kaa faisla kiya
 Even though the fast bowlers did not give the expected start after winning the toss, they used Ashwin and Jadeja in the best manner
 salaami ballebaaji ne jagaai ummidacarabian pari ke aakhri chaar overon me 51 ran lutaaney ke baad team india par balle se acchhee shuruyaat kaa dabaav tha
 The 234 goal put up by the Windies was challenging
 salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan or rohit sharma kii jodi ne is chunauti kaa munhtod jawaab diya
 Both batsmen took the news of West Indies' directionless bowling
 rohit or shikhar pehle vikat ke liye shatkeey saajhedaari kii
 This magnificent debut laid the foundation for the team's victory
 rohit sharma ne openar ke taur par lagaataar duusare match me acha pradarshan kiya
 He played a useful innings of 52 runs in 56 balls
 tej gendbaajon ne bhi banaaya rakhaa dabaavatim india kii jeet ke liye jadeja ke paanch wicket sabase ahm rahe par tej gendbaaj bhubaneshwar kumaar or ishanth sharma ke yogadan ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In fact, Bhuvneshwar and Ishant kept constant pressure from one end while Jadeja got the advantage at the other end
 ishanth ne 10 over main 1 wicket 43 ran kharche
 Most importantly, 20 of these 43 runs went in his last over
 yani 9 over main sirf 23 ran
 At the same time, Bhuvneshwar Kumar broke the back of the Caribbean batting with the wicket of Chris Gayle

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator As the fourth phase of polling has come, the Lok Sabha election 2019 has become focused on caste
 bispi adhyaksh mayawati ne kaha he ki piem narendra modi agadi jati se aate the, lekin gujarat main apni sarkaar ke dauraan inhone apni jati ko pichhadi jati main shaamil karvaa diya
 Mayawati said in a late evening press conference that PM Narendra Modi accused her and Akhilesh Yadav of calling themselves despicable in Kannauj, which is totally wrong
 mayawati ne kaha ki unhone narendra modi ko kabhi neech nahin kaha
 The issue of caste overshadowed the last day for the promotion of the fourth phase
 piem narendra modi chunaav prachaar karne jab uttar pradesh ke kannauj pahunche to vahaan se vah bispi or akhilesh yadav par khub barase
 Narendra Modi said that the BSP of the vote has forgotten the insult done by Baba Saheb by the SP
 piem modi ne kaha, "ye mat bhuuliye tirva main samaajawaadee party ne kaise baba sahib ambedkar kaa apmaan kiya tha, yah bispi ne bhula diya he, satta ke liye, kursi ke liye baba sahib kaa apmaan karne vaale logon ko mayawati gale lagaati hai"narendra modi ne kaha ki vipakshiyon kaa dhandha 'jaat-paat japana-janata kaa maal apana' he, chunaav ke dauraan ye partiyaan modi kii jati kaa raag alaapna shuru kar detii hai
 Modi said that he does not do caste politics, but would like to say that he is not backward, but very backward, but wants to make the country forward
 espi-bispi par barasate hue narendra modi ne kaha ki ye donon partiyaan unki jati ko lekar pramaan patr baant rahi hai, jo khel unhone kabhi khelaa nahin, lekin ve bataa dena chahta hum ki unki jati ati pichhadi jati he or inti choti he ki gaanv main ek-do hi ghar unki jati ke hote hai
 Explain that at the Mainpuri rally, Mayawati said that Mulayam Singh is actually a backward caste leader, whereas Modi is a fake backward caste
 shanivaar ko kannauj main narendra modi kii raily khatm hone ke baad mayawati der shaam modi par nishaanaa saadhane press conference par baithi
 In the press conference, Mayawati clearly stated that Narendra Modi belongs to the forward caste and when he was in Gujarat, he included his caste in the backward caste
 mayawati ne kaha ki piem modi dalit virdohi hai, rohit vemula or oona cond iske gavaah hai
 Referring to the Mandal commission, Mayawati said that the Mandal commission was opposed by the BJP and all anti-reservation supporters are with them
 bispi adhyaksh ne kaha ki janata sajag he, bijepi kii sarkaar har morche par vifal rahi he, or ab ye chunaav main kism-kism ke hatkande apana rahe hai, or isi kadi main becoward card chal rahe hai
 He said that people belonging to his caste have become victims of oppression under BJP rule
 mayawati ne kaha ki ho saktaa he unke press conference ke baad piem ab pichhadaa card khelnaa band kar den
 He said that this government never filled the reservation quota of Dalits, along with the reservation of Dalits and Backwardes is also being gradually eliminated
 sibiai kaa phir tote kii tarah istemaalauttar pradesh ke siem ke taur par mayawati ke kaarykaal main chini mil ghotaale kii jaanch shuru hone par bispi adhyaksh ne kaha ki chunaav ke dauraan kabhi kisi party ne jaanch agenciyon kaa istemaal nahin kiya lekin pehali baar is sarkaar ne chunaav ke dauraan iskaa istemaal kiya he
 Mayawati said that even after so many years in the sugar mill sale case, CBI is being used against her
 mayawati ne kaha ki chini mil bechney kaa faisla unhone nahin liya balki cabinet ne liya tha
 Mayawati said that CBI has once again been used as a parrot
 unhone kaha ki agar chini milon ke vikray main koi dosha he to uski jaanch kii ja sakati he lekin unki bhoomika spasht he
 All this is an attempt to mislead the public and mislead the issues
 ye sarkaar chunaav prabhavit karne ke liye ye hatkande apana rahi he
 Explain that the cbi's Anti Corruption Branch has registered an FIR in 2010-11 for the alleged scam in selling seven closed sugar mills

 When she is going to make her special moment come true, then she becomes a victim of circumstances and then blackmailing

 sarkaar ke 2 saal puure hone ke baad yah pehla mauka he jab mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne noida, greater noida or gajiabad ke praadhikaranon ke afasaron or rajya ke tamaam aalaa afasaron ke saath is baat ko lekar badi baithak kii he
 In this meeting, questions arose as to why the big builders are not giving their flats to the home buyers, due to whose omissions or collusion these big authorities and builders have looted the home buyers together
 greater noida ke shahberi main avaidh nirmaan karne vaale bilderon se home byrs ko raahat dilaane, amrapali jepi or unitech main fanse logon ko flats dilaane ke makasad se siem yogi adityanath ne yah meeting to bulaai thi
 But at the meeting, the arbitrariness of the officers and the fraud of the builders began to open
 siem yogi ne mukhya sachiv anup chandra pandeya ko doshi adhikariyon kii pahchaan karne saal 2007 se 2014 tak vahaan tainaat adhikariyon kii jimmedaari tay karne or jaanch kara kar doshi afasar or builder par rasuka lagane or jail bhejne tak ke aadesh die
 From 2007 to 2014, officers and officers posted in these authorities provided large amounts of land to the builders for a mere 10 per cent
 sarkaar ke mutabik is tarah kaa koi sarkari aadesh shashan str se nahin nikaala gaya tha
 The then officers and ceos posted in the three authorities set these rules at their level
 unhone 10 fisadi rakam par badi-badi jamine bilderon ko de di
 The builders did not deposit the remaining 90 percent of the money with the authorities
 alam yah ho gaya in praadhikaranon par bilderon ke bakaae 28 hajaar karod rupee se upar chale gaye hai, jise chukaana kisi builder ke boote kii baat nahin dikh rahi or na hi sarkaar in bade bilderon se inke paise nikaal paa rahi he
 The financial burden on these three authorities of NCR has increased so much that they are neither able to withdraw their money from the builder nor repay their debts
 siem yogi adityanath ne sabase pehle is meeting main us shasnadesh kii maang kii jiske tahat praadhikaran ne aise niyam bana kar bilderon ko jameen kodiyon ke mol di gai
 With the demand of CM Yogi's mandate, there was silence in the meeting
 unhen bataaya gaya ki us samay ke tainaat adhikariyon ne apane str par yah niyam banaae or phir baad main shashan se ise paas karaayaa
 From 2007 to 2014, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath sought the list of all the senior officers posted in these authorities and ordered their investigation and fixing of responsibility
 duusare bade project ke bilderon se paise waapas lene kaa tarika bhi siem yogi ne meeting main sujhaayaa
 He said that the manner in which NBCC has been given the responsibility to construct the flats of Amrapali Projects
 usee tarj par agenciyaan dhundhi jaaen bade bilders ke paas padi khaali jameenon kaa waapas adhigrahan kiya jaae
 Projects should be completed using those vacant lands
 yogi adityanath ne kaha ki jepi group jaisi companiyon ke paas na sirf jameen paryaapt hai balki kaiyon ke toll tex abhi chal rahe hai
 Default companies who have withdrawn people and put them in other projects
 unke duusare projects kaa bhi adhigrahan karne kii taiyaari sarkaar karen taaki kharidaaron ko jald jald raahat dilaai ja sake
 Yogi Adityanath also ordered an FIR to be sent to jail under the NSA by registering an FIR against the builders of illegal construction at Shahberry in Greater Noida
 -mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne noida, greater noida, yamuna expresve or shahberi se jude maamalon ko lekar adhikariyon ke saath meeting main jameen kharidaaron ko dikkat na hone dene kii baat kahi
 Yogi Adityanath also said to recover money from Shahberry's builders and return it to home buyers
 jaaniye or kya kaha siem yogi adityanath ne-yamuna express-ve, noida or greater noida audyogic vikaas praadhikaran se jude maamalon main adhikariyon kii javabdehi tay ho
 -yogi said- From 2007 to 2014, a list of officers involved in ground matters should be prepared
 -mukhyamantri ne awaas vikaas or ld dwaara banaae awaason kii gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye mukhya sachiv ko nirdesh die
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who was strict on the Shahberi case, has said that the accountability of the officers will be fixed in cases related to Shahberry, Yamuna Expressway, Noida and Grader Noida Industrial Development Authority
 in maamalon main laaparvaahee baratane vaale adhikariyon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaaegi
 Along with this, the Chief Minister has instructed to send an FIR under NSA against 30 builders who have illegally developed colonies in Shahberry, who have played with the lives of thousands of people
 mukhyamantri yogi ne kaha he ki jamini maamalon main sanlipt adhikariyon kii suchi taiyaar kii jaae, jisase in par sakht karrwai kii ja sake
 He held a meeting with officials in Lok Bhavan on Wednesday in connection with matters related to Noida, Greater Noida and Shahberry
 unhone kaha ki court ke ste ke baavjood shahberi main nirmaan kaise ho gaye, isaki jaanch karwaai jaae
 The government will take strict action against the officials responsible for this
 mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki saal 2014 ke baad jitne bhi nirmaan kaary kiye gaye hai, unke liye jimmedaar adhikariyon kii suchi banaai jaae
 Order to conduct security audit of buildings in Shahberry Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed that all buildings in Shahberry should have security audit
 jo nirmaan ansef he, unako giraane kii prakriya praadhikaran ko karnaa chahie
 The houses and flats in which people are living should be examined to find out who these people are and how these people bought buildings from the builders
 yogi ne adhikariyon ko nirdesh diya he ki is puure maamle kii adaalat main behatar tareeke se pairvi kii jaae
 Ministers, mps and mlas should interact with the people of Shahberry, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked the cabinet minister Satish Mahana present in the meeting to make contact with the minister Satish Mahana, local mps and mlas with Shahbari matter to communicate with the people there
 So that it can be resolved
 mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki shahberi main rahane vaale logon kii suraksha ke liye sarkaar vachanabaddh he
 In the case of other builders including Amrapali, the responsibility of the officers should be fixed

 pradhanmantri narendra modi 30 ko shapath lenge
 His cabinet ministers will also be sworn in on the same day
 sawaal ye he ki bhaajapa nit endie kii kis party ko modi ke mantriyon kii suchi main jagah milegi
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has formed a pre-poll alliance with 21 parties
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main deshbhar kii 29 raajnneetik partiyon ke saath bhaajapa kaa gathbandhan tha
 Soon after forming the government in 2014, Narendra Modi did not announce all the ministers
 is baar bhi ummid kam hi he
 Since, this time the number of parties in NDA is less and regional parties have done well
 isliye, kshetreey dalon ke saansadon ko mantrimandal main zyada bhagidaari mil sakati he
 In the first oath, 40 to 45 ministers can be made
 is baar pehle cabinet gathan main ek or duusare gathan main 2 yaa 3 mahilaon ko sthaan mil saktaa he
 According to the formula rule to make ministers from the winning mps, only 15% of the total mps of the House can become ministers
 yani kareeb 81 saansadon ko mantri banane kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 However, this rule can be changed as needed
 endie ne loksabhaa chunaav main 353 siten jiti hai
 Of this, BJP has 303 seats

 Krishna Pal Gurjar could be made a minister to keep Gurjars in favor in Haryana
 maharashtra main shivasena ne acha pradarshan kiya he
 There are elections this year as well
 aise main uske 3 se 4 saansadon ko mantrimandal main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Assembly elections are going to be held in Jharkhand too
 vahaan se ajasu party ke vijayi saansad ko bhi mantrimandal main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Assembly elections will be held in Bihar next year
 endie ke sahyogi dal jadyu ne loksabhaa chunaav main 17 main se 16 siton par kabja kiya he
 His 3 to 4 mps can also be included in the cabinet
 rajasthan se aralapi ke jite hue iklaute saansad ko bhi mantrimandal main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 The reason is that people of the Jat community will join this step
 mantrimandal main shaamil hone kaa ye nayaa formula bhi ho saktaa hamodi apane mantrimandal ko guladaste kii tarah sajaate hai
 In this they take care of professionalism, women participation, ethnic mathematics, urban-rural synergy, specialization, SC-ST representation and constituent seats, youth and seniority

 Seniority, specialty, loyalty and female representation

 namaskara, main raveesh kumaar
 The time goes by to prove who does or does the riot, but the answer to why the riot happened is found immediately
 donon pakshon ke bich anginat afvahanuma kisson se guzariye to pataa chalegaa ki kai dangon kii jadon main laudspikar he
 This was the reason not only from today but also in the riots of pre-independence period and still remains today
 agar ham dangon ko nahin roak sakate to ye faisla to kar hi sakate hai ki kisi bhi dharmik sthal yaa aayojan main laudspikar kaa istemaal nahin hoga
 But what to do where this loudspeaker becomes very important for management at times
 yah faisla bhi lambit hi rahegaa, lekin laudspikar par ham bhajan or azaan ko lekar kab jhagad jaaen pataa nahin
 This is Trilokpuri in East Delhi
 mayur vihaar or noida ke bich is mohalle kii traasadee yahi he ki jab november 1984 sikh virdohi dange hue to yahaan rahane vaale sainkadon sikhon ko maar diya gaya
 The Sikh families living there had to be displaced in this Delhi and go to Tilak Vihar
 aap tilak vihaar jaaenge to ab bhi kai logon kii jubaan par trilokapuri maayke kii yaad kii tarah maujuud milegaa
 After 30 years, in the same Trilokpuri from Diwali night to Sunday, there was stonewalling among Hindu Muslim society
 trilokapuri main 36 blaak hai
 Beginning at 20
 vahaan masjid ke paas saaf kii hui khaali zamin par kuch logon ne mata kii chaowkee laga di
 But when this outpost was not raised after Dussehra and the people coming to the mosque started to suffer due to the loudspeaker ringing, many kinds of apprehensions and stories started to form
 diwali kii raat is laudspikar ke bajane yaa na bajane ko lekar tanaav ho gaya
 Now, why did this tension happen, what happened later, there are many stories of all these things
 har paksh kii apni asankhya daleelein hai
 Between Thursday night and Friday afternoon, the situation deteriorated so much that people in both communities gave up their years of trust and rumors started spreading through Whats Up
 isliye whats ap ke zariye failane vaali aise afvaahon se satark rahiye
 There have been many such cases in your country regarding this
 kahaan se koi baat chalati he or kahaan pahunchati he kisi ko pataa nahin hota
 More than 35 people were injured
 inamen kai pulicekarmi bhi hai
 There is peace in Trilokpuri since Sunday, but more than a thousand replies of CRPF, RAF and Delhi Police are deployed to maintain this peace
 30 police vine ilaake kii nakaabandi main lagaai gai hai
 The ears of the city of Delhi should stand on what happened in Trilokpuri
 jisane 84 ke baad se shanti ke saath rahanaa sikh liya tha
 Not only among Hindus or Muslims, but also with rich poor linguistic people from different states
 dilli kii misaal mumbai or kolkata se bhi shandaar he
 This pattern of riots is happening
 iske kai kaaran hote hai or koi bhi danga do pakshon kii bhoomika ke bagaiyr nahin hota
 But the root cause of this is that at such a time, we immediately renounce our trust in each other and accept every kind of rumor
 alag-alag akhabaaron kii report ko pard kar yahi laga ki donon samudaay ke logon ne jimmedaari dikhaane ke bajaay afvaahon ko failaane main bhoomika nibhaai
 The rumors spread from whatsapp have taken shape
 police ne afvaah failaane or juthi soochna dene ke liye 12 logon ko hiraasat main liya he
 Rumors spread from the Muslim society that Hindus were coming to kill and from the Hindu society, rumors spread that Muslims were coming to kill
 mere liye tay karnaa mushkil he ki in baton par hansaa jaae yaa shame ke maare saarvajanik rup se sar jhukaakar march kiya jaae
 Even if there is a quarrel with a mosque or mother's post and there are reasonable reasons for it to happen, but what the people of the rest of the society think and jump into it
 kya unhen pataa nahin ki dange karaae jate hai
 Do they not know that by spreading such intrigue, the mistrust between the two communities is increased
 par kya yah danga ruk saktaa tha agar prashasan or police ne samay par karrwai kii hoti
 You can also debate whether it is a riot or communal violence
 meerut main lav jihad kaa hashr aap dekh chuke hai
 How a dangerous game of mistrust was played between the two communities over this incident
 baad main us khabar ne kitne mode liye or kitne rup nikal kar aae uske
 On the latest turn, this news proved to be fake and it is also being talked about by politicians to make such allegations
 main khud trilokapuri ke ilaake se guzarataa hum
 There is a drain coming from UP which falls in the Yamuna
 tyoharon ke vakt isamen saaf pani choda jaataa he, jahaan log ghat banaakar puja archana karte hai
 Trilokpuri is a lower middle class area
 yahaan rahane vaale log mayur vihaar noida or aas paas ke ilaake main kaam karte hai
 In homes as well as in offices and factories
 varshon se guzara hum
 Thankfully, there was not much damage, but you cannot ignore it, as communal tension in Delhi became the backdrop
 isliye baaki dilli ko bhi satark hone kii zarurat he
 Avoid the little rumors, ask the question where are the people who set up the mother post
 koun hai
 Where are the people who got into a quarrel
 ye sab sawaal hai
 After the solid arrest of ten people, the whole case can be reached but if it takes three days in Delhi to stop the tension, then understand how easy it is to commit communal violence in the rest of the country

 kejariwal kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya dilli sarkaar ke rosemara ke kaam sambhaal rahe the
 Two years ago, a family of four mysteriously disappeared from Delhi
 ek roj baad beti kii laash upi kii ek nahar se milti he, jabaki baaki teen logon kaa koi pataa nahin chalata
 The UP police termed the case as honor killing, saying that the father-mother and brother together killed the girl and then committed suicide
 lekin ab do saal baad wo sach saamne aata he, jo sidhe-sidhe upi police ko hi katghare main khadaa kar detii he
 In fact, the girl's three housemates, whom the UP police were referring to as the murderer, were themselves murdered
 ab sawaal tha ki chaaron katl kisne kiya or kyon? aakhir katl kaa ye maamla do saal tak tak kaise chupa rahaa? or do saal baad ab ye raaj khulaa to kaise?ek saath ek parivaar ke chaar logon keqatlaki is sansanikhez kahani se shaayad kabhi pardaa nahin hatataa agar dilli police kii krime branch ke haath ek suraag naa lagata
 Because UP police had put a fullstop on its investigation by calling this case a case of honor killing
 lekin do saal baad achaanak dilli police kii krime branch ko ek aisi baat pataa chali, jisane puure maamle ko hi sir ke bal khadaa kar diya
 Out of this family that disappeared in July 2016, only one ie the daughter's body was recovered by the UP Police from Hapur's Ganga Canal
 jabaki parivaar ke baaki log yani maa-baap or bhai kaa ab bhi kuch pataa nahin tha
 In such a situation, the UP Police considered it a case of honor killing and accepted three family members as absconders
 yani upi police kii theory ke mutabik maa-baap or bhai ne milakar beti kii hatya kii or khud kahin faraar ho gaye
 But not only did the UP Police accept this, but also kept the charge sheet in the matter and closed it while doing the investigation
 jabaki haqiqat ye thi ki sirf is ghar kii beti hi nahin, balki puraa kaa puraa parivaar qaatil kaa shikaar ban chukaa tha
 And the result of the investigation of this basement of UP police is that Ash lived a life away from the eyes of the real murderer, even after killing four people
 lekin ek rose achaanak taqadir kaa pahiyaa ghumaa, vakt ne palati maari or qaatil kaa bhed khul gaya
 How did all this happen? How the secret of killing a family? How did the investigation of UP police overturn? You will be shocked if you know this
 aise khulata gaya katl kaa rajaisa isse pehle dekhne ko nahin mila jab qaatil ek-ek kar chaar logon kii jaan le le or police kaatil ko pakadaney kii jagah ulte marane waalon ko hi ek-duusare kaa qaatil tehra de
 But this happened in Hapur near Delhi
 upi police ne chaar logon ke qatl ke maamle main marane waalon ko hi qaatil tehra diya or kaha ki parivaar ke teen logon ne mil kar khud apni beti kii jaan lee or phir khudakushi kar lee
 That is, the case was of honor killing
 lekin sirf ek suraag ne do saal baad maamle kii asli kahani kakhulasaakar diya
