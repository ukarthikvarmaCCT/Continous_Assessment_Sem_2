 samvidhan ke anusaar janaganana ke aadhaar par aarakshan dey nahin he
 The petition also said that the Constitution has made reservations on the basis of educational and social backwardness, but without taking this into consideration in the New Amendment Act, reservation has been given to five castes including Gurjars in MBC category which is wrong

 Republic Day 2019: We all know a lot about the national anthem and the national anthem
 lekin kya kabhi ye sochaa he ki aakhir raashtragan or raashtragit ke peeche kii kahani kya he
 How "jana-gana-mana" was given the national anthem and "vande Mataram" was given the status of national anthem
 aaj ham aapako iske bare main vistaar se bataaenge
 First of all, we talk about the national anthem, if you ask anyone what you know about the national anthem, then they will tell here that 'jana Gana Mana' has been sung since when we were in school, or Rabindranath Tagore Had written kya aap iske alaava kuch or baaten jaanate hai
 
 
 The national anthem was written in Bengali in the year 1905
 27 disambar 1911 ko pehali baar bhartiya rashtriya congress kii kolkata (tab kalakatta) sabha main gaaya gaya tha
 People outside Bengal did not know it at that time
 samvidhan sabha ne jan gana man ko bharat ke raashtragan ke rup main 24 janvari 1950 ko apanaaya
 Republic Day 2019: The story of India's tricolor, how our national flag was made because of the national anthem, the national anthem was made because of its meaning
 iske kuch anshon kaa arth hota he ki bharat ke naagarik, bharat kii janata apane man se aapako bharat kaa bhagya vidhaataa samajhati he
 o Adhinayak (super Hero), you are the fortune-teller of India
 iske saath hi isamen desh ke alag- alag rajyon kaa zikr bhi kiya gaya tha or unki khoobiyon ke bare main bataaya gaya tha
 The national anthem takes 52 seconds to complete the song while the duration of its version is about 20 seconds
 raashtragan main 5 pad hai
 Rabindranath Tagore not only wrote the national anthem, but he also sang it
 ise andhra pradesh ke ek chote se jile madanapillai main gaaya gaya tha
 Very few people would be aware of the national anthem Vande Mataramis that the talk of making Vande Mataram was the first national anthem
 lekin phir ise desh raashtragit banane kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Because its initial four lines are dedicated to the country, the later lines are in Bengali and Maa Durga is praised
 aaie jaanate hai vande maataram bharat kaa raashtragit he, lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki ise raashtragan naa banaakar raashtragit kyon banaaya gaya
 This is historiography Vande Mataram was written in the year 1875 by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in Bengali
 jise unhone saal 1881 main apni noval aanandamath main bhi jagah di
 It was first sung by Rabindranath Tagore in a political context in the 1896 session of the Indian National Congress
 vahiin agar bangla bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaae to iskaa sheershak 'vaden maataram' nahin balki 'bande maataram' hona chahie kyonki hindi or sanskrit bhashaa main 'vande' shabd hi sahi he, lekin yah geet mularoop main bangla main likhaa gaya tha or bangla lipi main 'va' akshar he hi nahin isliye bankim chandra chattopadhyaay ne ise 'bande maataram' hi likhaa tha
 What is Vande Mataram does not mean 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and saying 'vande Mataram' makes 'mata Vandana' meaning 'vande Mataram', hence it is called Vande Mataram in Devanagari script
 aise hui rashtriya geet kii rachanabankimchandra ne jab is geet kii rachana kii tab bharat par british shaskaon kaa dabadabaa tha
 a song from Britain was' God! Save the Queen '
 bharat ke har samaaroh main is geet ko anivaary kar diya gaya
 Bankim Chandra used to work in government jobs at that time
 angrejon ke bartaav se bankim ko bahut bura laga or unhone saal 1876 main ek geet kii rachana kii or uskaa sheershak diya 'vande maataram'

 If the knife does not have an edge then the cooking work becomes very difficult
 chaaku kichan main sabase adhik istemaal hone vaala tul he
 In such a situation, if it becomes bad, then it affects all the work
 aise main ye jaruri he ki aapke paas acchhee gunvattta vaale chaaku hon
 The edge of the knives used in the kitchen should always be good so that whatever you have to cut is cut easily and properly
 bina dhar vaala chaaku istemaal karnaa jitna mushkil he utana hi khatarnaak bhi he
 Many a times it happens that if the edge is not right, it can slip and the hand may get hurt
 vaise to chaaku kii dhar tej karne ke kuch vishesh upkaran hote hai lekin agar aap bazaar nahin janaa chaahate hai or ghar baithkar hi chaaku kii dhar tej kar lenaa chaahate hanto ye upaay aapke liye kargar sabit ho sakate hai
 The good thing is that all these tools used for sharpening knives will be found in the house very easily
 1
 If you have any steel concrete or iron by rubbing it on steel concrete, you can sharpen the knife edge by sitting at home
 steel ke thos ko pani se dhokar acchhee tarah saaf kar lijie
 After this, keep that solid in the sun
 jab steel kaa wo thos suraj kii roshni se garm ho jaae to chaaku ko us par ragaden
 You may see some sparks rising
 is upaay se aapkaa chaaku tejadhaar chaaku ban jayega lekin chaaku ghisne ke dauraan saavdhaanee rakhana bahut jaruri he
 2
 rod par ragadkajgar aapke paas lohe yaa steel kaa koi thos nahin he to pareshaan hone kii jarurat nahin he
 You can also do this with the help of iron or steel rod
 steel kii rod par chaaku kii dhar kii ore se ragaden
 After doing this for some time, you will find that the knife edge has become sharper
 3
 You can also sharpen the knife edge by rubbing granite on granite stone
 chaaku ke dhar vaale hisse ko pathar par teji se ragaden
 The knife edge will be sharp
 haalanki ye prayog karne ke dauraan saavdhaan rahanaa behad jaruri he
 Before sharpening the knife, you must know that every knife cannot be sharpened by rubbing
 aise main unheen chaakuon ko tej karen jinhen dobaaraa tej kiya ja saktaa he
 By adopting any of these three measures, you can recover your useless knife again
 lekin uske baad in chaakuon ko pani or sirke ke ghol main kuch der ke liye chhod dijie
 This will keep the knife sharpened for a long time

 isliye unako hindu hriday samraat kaha jaataa tha
 Bal Thackeray has sent Chandrika Kenia, Pritish Nandy and Sanjay Nirupam to Rajya Sabha during his time
 unhone uttar bhartiya netaa ghanashyam dube ko bhi vidhaan parishad sadsy banaaya tha
 Bal Thackeray's nephew Raj Thackeray certainly paid more attention to the language debate and also opposed the North Indians in Mumbai in the name of getting the rights of Bhumiputras
 par bal thakare ke bete uddhav thakare hameshaa se sabko saath main lekar hi chalane kii baat karte rahe hai
 When the Congress leader of today, Sanjay Nirupam used to be the Executive Editor and Rajya Sabha MP of 'noon Ka Saamna', then the North Indian Maha Sammelan was also organized
 haalanki baad main nirupam uddhav thakare ke saath kuch matbhed ke chalate shivasena chhod congress main chale gaye
 The Shiv Sena, under the leadership of Udhav Thackeray, has been talking about Marathi identity but did not launch any special campaign against the provinces
 baavjood iske party ko jode rakhane or rajya main ek majboot raajnneetik takat ke rup main shivasena ko banaae rakhaa
 Uddhav Thackeray is still the party president of Shiv Sena but most of the decisions are taken by his son Aditya Thackeray
 aditya ke chunaav maidan main utarane par jab uddhav thakare se poocha gaya to uhone badi hi bebaaki se kaha ki samay badal rahaa he, aditya yuva hai, aaj ke yuvaaon kii soch alag he
 Aditya is more interested in legislative work
 acchhee baat he puraa parivaar or party uske saath he
 It is clear that the Thackeray family, which was following the policy of running power on the strength of remote, has understood that politics is changing with changing times
 takat ab satta kii kursi main zyada he
 If the growing satraps in the party are to be kept under control, then it is necessary to occupy a big chair in the government
 party fund ke sroton kii jaankaree or niyantran ke bina aaj kii raajnneeti mushkil he
 So Aditya was already being promoted as the future Chief Minister all through the year
 bijepi ke saath siton ke bantwaare main sirf 124 siton par ladakar mukhyamantri kii kursi tak pahunchnaa bhale hi aasaan nahin he lekin asambhav bhi nahin he
 It is difficult to say what will be the result of the election and what will be the politics
 baat sirf aditya ke chunaav ladane or alag-alag bhashaaon main hording lagane tak simit nahin he
 The Shiv Sena, which has always advocated the creation of a Ram temple in Ayodhya under extreme Hindutva and in any case, is now talking about fighting for the rights of Muslims
 shivaji park main party ke dashahra sammelan main uddhav thakare ne manch se elaan kiya ki unki party sirf dhanagar ,obisi or duusare pichde virgon ke saath hi nahin he, deshbhakt musalamaanon ke adhikaron kii ladaai main bhi saath degi
 He reminded that there were also Muslim soldiers in Chhatrapatri Shivaji Maharaj's army

 bihar main jangalraj ek baar phir se laut aayaa he
 Where two people working in a construction company in Chapra district were shot dead
 is ghatana ne ek baar phir bihar kii kanoon vyavastha par sawalia nishaan laga diya he
 The people of Bihar have not yet forgotten the Darbhanga engineer murder case that two employees of a road construction in Chapra on Friday morning were gunned down
 sristi deveopment privet limited naam kii sadak nirmaan company ke ek manager or ek munshi ko beeti raat badmaashon ne goliyon se bhun daalaa
 This road construction company was engaged in road construction work from Dighwara to Chhapra to Bheldi
 is sadak nirmaan company kaa bhagavanpur main base camp tha or yah ghatana base camp ke andar hi ghatit hui
 They were killed while both were fast asleep
 mauka-e-vaardaat se police ko shuukravaar kii subah kaartoos ke paanch khokhe baraamad hue he
 According to the information, the name of the manager is Dharamvir Kumar, who was a resident of Patna
 vahiin munshi kaa naam laal babu mishra he, jo ki begusarai kaa nivasee tha
 The police is investigating the entire case
 sutron kii maane to yah puraa maamla rangadari or levi se judaa hua he
 According to the information, the crooks were constantly demanding extortion money from Srishti Development Private Limited Company
 magar company ke karmchaaree iskaa virodh kar rahe the
 It is feared that both these murders have been committed due to non-extortion
 ghatana ke baad sadak nirmaan company ke base camp main mazdooron ne kaam band kar diya he
 Everybody is very scared
 is sambandh main police nehatyaka maamla darj kar karrwai shuru kar di he
 So far, the hands of the police are empty in this case
 gauratlab he ki disambar 2015 main bihar ke hi darbhanga jile main do ejiniyaron kii hatya kar di gai thi
 This murder case caught a lot of weight
 mritkon ke parijanon or sthaneey logon ne sadak par pradarshan kar rasta jam kar diya tha
 Whereas in January 2016 also Ankit, an engineer resident of Vaishali district of Bihar, was also murdered
 jo mujffarpur kii ek telecom company main kaam karata tha

 The political board of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is being spread with the help of Dalit votes
 narendra modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa chunaav se aath maheene pehle dalit mudde par bada kadam uthaaya he
 The government has decided to overturn the Supreme Court's decision on the SC / ST Act and bring an amendment bill to restore it to its original form
 modi sarkaar kaa ye faisla dalit virdohi chhavi ko todane or unki naaraazgi ko dur karne vaala kadam mana ja rahaa he
 Only time will tell how much the heart of the Dalit community will sweat for Modi with this step? The strength of Dalit politics is 20 in the total population of the country
 14 karod dalit hai
 There are a total of 543 Lok Sabha seats in the country
 inamen se 84 siten anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke liye arakshit hai
 The BJP won 41 of these 84 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 dalit aabaadi vaala sabase bada rajya punjab he
 31 here
 9 fisadi aabaadi dalit he or 34 siten daliton ke liye arakshit hai
 About 20 in Uttar Pradesh
 7 fisadi dalit aabaadi he
 The state has 17 Lok Sabha and 86 assembly seats reserved
 bijepi ne 17 loksabhaa or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 76 vidhansabha arakshit siton par jeet darj kii thi
 25 in Himachal
 2 fisadi, haryana main 20

 Important role of Dalits Dalits played an important role in the bjp's success in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi pasopesh main he ki kahin daliton kii naaraazgi 2019 main uske liye mahangi na pad jaae, vahiin congress sahit vipakshi partiyaan is koshish main lagi hai ki daliton kaa dil jitkar ek baar phir satta main vaapasi kar sake
 In fact, on March 21 this year, the Supreme Court stayed the immediate arrest in cases registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act (SC / ST Act 1989)
 iske alaava sarkari karmchaariyon kii giraftaar sirf sakasham athurity kii ijaajat ke baad hi ho sakati he
 Dalit organizations took to the streets on April 2 against the Supreme Court's decision
 dalit samudaay ne do april ko 'bharat band' kiya tha
 The central government was scorched in the heat of protest
 deshbhar main hue dalit andolan main kai ilaakon main hinsa hui thi, jisamen ek darjan logon kii maut ho gai thi
 The Dalit society was expressing its displeasure with the central government, taking the Modi government responsible for the Supreme Court's decision
 centre sarkaar or bijepi ko dalit virdohi bataaya ja rahaa tha
 Dalit organizations have once again given the ultimatum to the government that if by August 9, the SC ST Act is not enacted in the old form, then they will protest in a big way
 modi sarkaar kaa nayaa daanvmodi sarkaar ne maujuuda raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekhte hue SC / ST act ko uske mul swaroop main laane kaa faisla kiya
 If the government brings this amendment to the legislator, it will pass
 desh main dalit maton kii ahmiyat ko dekhte hue koi bhi dal iskaa virodh khulkar nahin kar sakenge
 In such a situation, then this law will come in its original form and the reshuffle of the Supreme Court will have no meaning
 iske saath hi ek sawaal ye bhi he ki kya is faisle ke baad ab modi ke netritv vaali bijepi ke upar dalit virdohi hone kaa aarope lagata he, kya wo dur ho paaegaa
 Ambedkar Mahasabha President Dr
 lalji prasad nirmal kehete hai ki SC / ST act par sarkaar kaa faisla kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 The SC / ST Act is the lifeline for the Dalit community
 ye daliton ke har class ke liye kaaphi ahmiyat rakhata he
 In such a situation, the Modi government has taken a better and bold step
 sarkaar ke is faisle se dalit samudaay kii naaraazgi dur hogi or chunaav main iskaa phayda bhi milegaa
 Dalit thinker Professor Sunil Kumar Suman says that the government has taken steps in view of the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main dalit samudaay ke jaagruk log unke jhaanse main nahin aaenge
 He said that what action the government is taking is not important but what is its ideology, it matters
 bijepi kii vicharadhara dalit adivasee virdohi he
 Everyone is aware of this
 suman kehete hai ki modi sarkaar ne pichley chaar saal main dalit adivaasiyon kaa jitna nuksaan kiya he, utana pachaas saal main nahin hua
 Modi government is not going to amend the SC / ST Act happily but the Dalit community had pressure on them, so they brought the bill
 jan dawaab main aakar inhone faisla liya he
 However, the nda's partner Dalit parties are relieved by the Modi government's move
 essi asti act main badlaav ke baad bhi satta main bhagidaar rahane ko lekar unki niyat par sawaal uthaae ja rahe the
 Dalit leadership like Ram Vilas Paswan, Ramdas Athawale and Udit Raj were finding it difficult to defend on the Dalit issues of their own government
 dalit chintak pro
 Ratan Lal says that the decision of the government must have brought happiness not to the Dalit community but to the NDA Dalit allies, who were shifting away from the society
 ab ve dalit samudaay ke bich modi sarkaar ke agent ke rup main jaakar sarkaar kaa paksh rakhenge, lekin samaaj inase waakif ho gaya he
 They say that not only the SC ST Act but also the abolition of reservation are many Dalit issues, people are angry with the Modi government
 aise main samaaj ke dabaav main sarkaar ne kadam uthaaya he
 In the last four years, the attitude of the government has been recognized by the Dalit society
 aise main inke bahekaave main nahin aane vaala
 Former Finance Minister and senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley died on Saturday at the age of 66 in AIIMS, Delhi
 vah lambey samay se beemaari se jujh rahe the
 Many veteran leaders condole the death of Arun Jaitley
 vahiin arun jetali ne jin gaanvon ko god liya tha, un gaavon ke log bhi gaanv bhi shok main duube hue hai
 Shops in these villages remained closed despite Janmashtami after receiving news of Jaitley's death
 arun jetali kendriya raajnneeti se saalon se sakriy the
 Jaitley was also a minister in the government of Atal Bihari Bajpai and Narendra Modi
 arun jetali kaa gujarat se bhi khaas naata tha or arun jetali yahaan se rajyasabha main BJP ke saansad the
 Arun Jaitley had adopted four villages of Karnali group panchayat in Vadodara district of Gujarat under the 'sansad Adarsh gram Yojana'
 arun jetali yahaan aksar aayaa karte the
 It is said that Arun Jaitley had great faith in the Kubera Bhandari temple in Karnali
 purv vitt mantri arun jetali kaa nidhan, yahaan den shradhanjaliarun jetali ke nidhan ke samachar se in gaanvon main shok kaa maahaul he
 The people of the village are sad

 He was a very humble person and we are saddened by his death today

 People gathered and kept silence and prayed for the peace of their souls
 abhinayta aamir khan ek baar phir se funs gaye
 This time not because of a controversial statement, but because of the presence of his fans
 darasal aamir khan apnifilm 'dangal' kii shootingek ghar ke andar kar rahe the or unke phens kaa jamaavada us ghar ke aasapaas puri tarah se ho gaya tha
 For this reason, Aamir Khan was stuck at the same location during the shooting for about 8 hours
 yahi nahin suraksha hone ke baavjoodamir khan ko apni venity or shootingalokeshan ke bich aane jane main kaaphi mashkkat kerani pad rahi thi
 Then Aamir decided that he would stay inside the same house where the scene was being shot during the entire shoot
 jabaamirshooting khatm karke baahar nikle tab tak puri sadak phens se bhar chuki thi or us lokation se nikalne ke liye aamir ko ghanton mashkkat kerani padi
 Aamirin has been doing the film 'dangal' based on the life of wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat
 hamen hameshaa se bataaya gaya he ki cholestrol buree cheez he, haalanki hakeekat thodi alag he
 Cholesterol is a fat-like substance found in every cell of the body
 yah sharir kaa anivaary hissaa he
 It is needed for the strengthening of cell membranes, hormone-related components, nerves and brain development
 yah sharir main hormone, vitamin di or khaanaa pachaane main madadgaar padaarthon kaa nirmaan bhi karata he
 The cholesterol we need is produced in the body
 lekin tay seemaa se zyada maatra main banane par blad cholestrol ko badha detaa he or rakt nalikaaon main jamaa ho jaataa he
 This narrows the path of the arteries, which is called atherosclerosis
 isse coronary artery disease (siedi), mastishk pakshaaghaat or bahya naadee rog kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Cholesterol floats along the stream of blood in small packages
 inhen lipoprotein kaha jaataa he
 These packages are made of fat or fat on the inside and protein on the outside
 kam ghanatv vaale cholestrol, jinhen lo dencity lipoprotein (ldl) kaha jaataa he, rakt vahikaaon main jamaa ho jate hai jabaki zyada ghanatv yaa hydencity lipoprotein (echdiel) ko ‘‘acha cholestrol’’ kaha jaataa he kyonki ye cholestrol ko sharir ke duusare hisson se waapas liver tak le jaataa he or use sharir se baahar kar detaa he
 Three out of every 20 people have a cholesterol disorder
 lekin inkaa koi lakshan nahin hota or sirf niyamit jaanch se hi inkaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 So most people do not realize that their cholesterol level has increased
 kul milakar, khun me ldl cholestrol kaa str jitna zyada hoga to dil kaa daura padane kaa khatra bhi zyada hoga or echdiel kaa str jitna zyada hoga, khatra utana hi kam hoga
 The level of cholesterol in the blood depends on diet, physical activity and weight
 cholestrol, saturated fat or trans fat vaala khaanaa simit maatra main khaanaa chahie or mono or poliansaturated fat (piuefee) vaale padaarth, jaise saflower, sanflower or fish oil zyada maatra main lenaa chahie
 Dried fruits also reduce blood cholesterol to a great extent
 saturated fat kuch maansaahaaron, deyari utpaadon, chocolate, backed vastuon, adhik tel main tale hue or prasanskarit aahaaron or nariyal tel jaise kuch telon main paaya jaataa he
 These are the things in our food that increase the level of LDL the most
 trans fats kuch tale hue, backed or prasanskarit khaadya padaarthon main paae jate hai
 These increase the level of LDL cholesterol in your body and reduce HDL i
e
 good cholesterol
 anuvanshikta, umr jaisi kuch baton par to khayr hamaara koi niyantran nahin he
 High blood cholesterol is sometimes inherited from the family, as it has been observed that metabolic disturbances occur mainly due to genetic reasons
 itnaa hi nahin, jaise-jaise umr badhati he, ldl kaa str bhi badhata jaataa he
 LDL levels are lower in women than men before the age of 55
 lekin 55 kii umr ke baad unamem ldl kaa str purushon kii tulana main zyada ho saktaa he
 What to do: You have to do a lipid profile test every three months to check cholesterol level
 -cholestrol ko kaabo main rakhane vaala khan-paan hi len
 - Those who are found in saturated fat in things, eat them sparingly
 masalan kuch maance, deyari or backed product
 Eat oatmeal, apples, pears, rich in soluble fiber
 ye pachan tantra ko cholestrol sokhne se rokatii hai
 - Keep body weight under regular exercise for at least 30 minutes per day
 rahul gandhi ke chuttee par jane kii baat ne congress kii sthiti par manthan se zyaada raajnneetik chutkule paidaa kar die hai
 Due to the news of holidaying abroad in the coming days, this sarcasm is being done whether the holidays also have their own fatigue, which needs more holiday to be erased! kair
 Rahul's decision to go on leave has made the questions before the Congress more serious
 rahul gandhi main qabiliyat nahin he, phir bhi sonia gandhi un par daanv khel rahi hai, kyonki wo putr moh main fansi he
 
 
 This is the most common accusation against Sonia Gandhi regarding Rahul Gandhi
 or ye baat sirf congress ke aalochak hi nahin, dabe-chupe sur main congress ke kai diggaj bhi kah jate hai, apni-apni kotary main baith kar
 But maybe you find this information astonishing that Priyanka was Sonia's first choice, not Rahul
 lekin katipay kaarnon se ye ho na sakaa
 Therefore, to say and accept Sonia Gandhi is stuck in Putra Mohoo, it would be very simplistic to see the inner circles of the Congress
 129 saal puraani party ke teen gandhiyon ke aapasi rishton kii paraten pyaaz ke chhilake kii tarah hai
 The more you peel, the peel will end
 isi kram main ankhon se aansu nikal aayega, so alag
 Let us try to understand a little sequentially
 pehle 2004 main chalate hai
 The NDA was contesting the elections with Slogan of Shining India after its rule of 6 years
 congress ko tanik bhi ummid nahin thi ki chunaav main kahin se bhi upie kii sarkaar banane kii koi gunjaaish he
 But the party wanted to stay in the election
 party ko sonia kaa saath to tha hi, lekin sonia andar se chaahati thim ki kaman gandhi parivaar kii nai peedi ko saunpane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 It may seem strange to hear that when the party is not confident of victory, then why would Sonia want to stake her child
 lekin tab sonia kii soch kuch alag thi
 He had to prepare the Congress leadership for the future
 aam chunaav kisi nae netritv ko ubhaarne kaa sabase behtareen mauqaa hota he
 Sonia wanted to use this opportunity
 atal-adwani ke barkhilaaf apni agali peedi ko pesh kar wo ek majboot sandesh dena chaahati thi
 She also wanted to show that it was not in her nature to give up before the election
 wo takkar dena or takkar lenaa chaahati thi
 According to a source close to the Gandhi family, Sonia Gandhi called Priyanka Gandhi and told her mind
 salaah-mashvira kiya or priyanka ko maidan main aane ko kaha
 But Priyanka refused very thoughtfully
 jis priyanka ke bare main khud rajeev gandhi kah chuke hon ki shuruaati umr se hi wo raajnneetik gahraiyon ko samajhane lageen thim, bhala ek aise samay main apana cheharaa aage kyon karti, jab haath jalane kaa puraa khatara tha
 Along with the entire Congress, Priyanka was not even confident that a government could be formed from anywhere under the leadership of the Congress
 priyanka ke isi akalan ne priyanka-sonia-rahul ke bich raajnneeti kaa aisa trikon bana diya, jiske har kone kii chubhan aaj bhi rah-rahakar party ko ho rahi he
 After Priyanka's refusal, Sonia saw no other option and proposed to contest in front of Rahul Gandhi
 maa kii ichha ko rahul taal nahin paae
 They came and were fielded from Amethi
 2004 main congress ke netritv main upie van bananaa kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin tha
 Rahul Gandhi had knocked in Parliament, but Lalan's feet had just come out of observance
 zaahir he unase abhi aisi raajnneetik paripakvata kii ummid bemaani thi, jisko aadhaar bana kar unhen shashan satta saunp di jaae
 It also does not approve of the congregation around Sonia, who, of course, seems willing to give up everything in front of 10, Janpath, but also carry her own ambitions inside
 rahul to vaise bhi maa kii ichha puri karne ke liye chunaav main koode the, so unamem pradhanmantri pad kii koi lalak paidaa nahin hui thi
 Sonia did not even want to take the risk of imposing such a huge responsibility on Rahul
 sonia par khud dabaav tha pradhanmantri banane kaa
 Why she kept becoming Prime Minister is a well known fact
 kair
 Manmohan Singh became Prime Minister
 upie van ke baad upie tu bhi bani
 But Rahul stayed away from power
 bich-bich main unhen satta saunpane kaa zikr uthta rahaa
 But the Prime Minister kept away from becoming even a minister
 kai ise 10, janpath ke balidaan kii tarah pesh karne kii koshish karte hai
 But here too the situation was about the onion peel
 chhilne par kya nikalegaa pataa nahin
 Sonia did not put the responsibility on Rahul or Rahul did his best to take responsibility
 bada sawaal gathbandhan dalon ke netaaon ke bich unki sweekaaryata kaa jitna tha, utana hi congress ke puraane diggajon ke bich bhi unako apana samajhe jane kaa tha
 After this comes the 2014 elections, where even after putting forward Rahul's face, the Congress is reduced to 44 seats
 uske pehle or baad ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi congress lagaataar gote lagaati gai he
 Rahul's team, which has been formed in the last 10 years, has been pointing fingers at the team which is built around Sonia Gandhi for such a defeat
 beshak sonia ne use nahin banaaya ho, lekin sonia us team ke suzav or sahyog ke bina chal bhi nahin sakati
 This situation of the confrontation between Team Rahul and Team Sonia has deepened
 sonia ke swasthya or sakriyata main kami ko aadhaar maanakar team rahul har bade faisale rahul ke haathon chaahati he, lekin durandeshi puraane sipahasaalar sonia ko sajag rakhane main ek had tak abhi tak kaamyaab rahe hai
 Team Sonia has been able to some extent to convince Sonia that Rahul cannot take full responsibility
 isliye ek vakt rahul ke peeche khulkar khadin sonia samay-samay par apane rigervetions bhi dikhaati raheen hai
 On one side, while she seems to be moving while protecting her old guards from Rahul's wrath, on the other hand she does not want to be suspicious of Rahul's ability
 aisa nahin he ki sonia ne rahul ko khulkar faisalaa lene-dene kii azaadi nahin di
 Whether the primaries are used in 15 seats in the Lok Sabha elections or the decision to contest in the recent Delhi Assembly elections by putting forward Ajay Maken's face at the last minute, Rahul's initiative does not seem to have paid off anywhere
 yahi vajah he ki santhnik chunaav 'loktantric' tareeqe se karaane ke rahul ke aagrah ko ab zid ke taur par dekha jane laga he or party ke bheetar ise lekar koi utsaah nazar nahin aata
 Sonia is well aware of this truth
 ek maa ke taur par beshak unhen apane bete main apaar sambhaavnaaen dikh raheen ho, lekin ek raajnneetik maa ke taur par ve apane bete ko acchhee tarah pard chuki hai
 But the compulsion with Sonia is that now she cannot change the goal post
 rahul kii jagah ab ve phir se priyanka kaa daravaaza nahin khatkhata sakati
 Priyanka declares that she should talk about staying away from politics, citing her responsibilities towards children and family, but the information inside is that she has started preparing herself mentally for this
 samasyaayein do hai
 Neither brother wants to eat food, nor does he want to be seen snatching the entire plate of brother
 ye bhi ki jis maa ke shuruaati ofer ko thukraa diya tha, ab us maa se mauqaa kaise hasil karnaa he
 And Priyanka's nature is such that she does not want anything half-incomplete
 jab stage pur set ho, to wo gaaze-baaje ke saath avatarit hona chaahati hai
 And until that happens, as a sister, she is constantly seen to play a balanced role in solving every political problem of her brother
 tabhi jab rahul chunavi haar ke baad party ke kai puraane netaaon se naaraaz hote hai, to panchayat priyanka ke saamne lagati he or ve madhyasth ke taur par darre ko paatane kii koshish karti nazar aati hai
 She does not want to do any harm to the future by displeasing the mother in any way or listening to them and breaking the image of the mother's trusty and captive daughter in the Indian public
 ek samasya sonia ke saamne bhi he
 10, Janpath is sure to be locked as soon as Priyanka goes in command
 sonia ke akele padane kaa khatara hoga
 All the stalwarts of the party who still offer the sheesh in front of Sonia, will be caught in Priyanka's resentment as soon as the command of the party is moved
 kul mila kar mata-putree ke bich usee tarah kii khinchataan ho sakati he, jaise raajnneeti main aksar pita-putr ke bich dekhne ko milti rahi he
 While giving full command to Rahul, Sonia can have a natural intervention on him
 unhen bharosa he ki rahul maa ke taur par maardarshak kii bhoomika main unhen hameshaa rakhenge na ki adwani kii tarah kii maardarshak kii bhoomika main dhakel denge
 So it is not son-infatuation, Rahul is the name of Sonia's helplessness
 isliye bete ke chuttee se laut kar aane kaa intazaar he

 Hearing the dahi-handi case in Maharashtra, the Supreme Court has ruled that the height of dahi-handi will not increase more than 20 feet
 yachikakarta ne kaha tha ki bacchon par roak ke liye vah taiyaar hai, lekin 20 foot kii oonchai par roak hataai jaani chahie
 dahi-handi is famous in the country and abroad and Guinness Book Record has also been found regarding the height of the pyramid
 court ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki kya aap olympic main medal bhi laate hai
 We will be happy if you bring the medal
 gauratlab he ki 17 agast ko maharashtra main dahi handi ke maamle main supreme court ne faisla sunaaya tha or bombai hoicourt ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa tha
 Accordingly, children below 18 years of age will not participate and Dahi Handi's height will not exceed 20 feet, although the Supreme Court had said that it would continue hearing the case in October
 isse pehle sunwaayee main supreme court ne dahi handi ke khilaaf yachikakarta swati patil ko notice jari kiya tha
 The Supreme Court had said that the old petition has been disposed of
 yachika ko dobaaraa shuru kiya ja rahaa he
 The Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed by the Maharashtra government in the dahi-handi case
 tippaniyan The state government had requested the Supreme Court to give clarity in the 2014 orders, which allowed children up to 12 years of age to participate in dahi-handi, as well as the High Court's order to limit the height of 20 feet
 Was applied
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki kya yah aadesh ek saal ke liye tha yaa abhi bhi lagu he? ASG Tushar Mehta, on behalf of the Maharashtra government, told the Supreme Court that on August 11, 2014, the Bombay High Court had said in its order that youth below 18 years could not participate in dahi-handi and its height was more than 20 feet
 Should not be aayojakon ne supreme court main apil kii thi or supreme court ne hoicourt ke faisle par roak lagaate hue 12 saal tak ke bacchon ko hissaa lene kii ijaajat de di thi or oonchai ke aadesh par bhi roak laga di thi, lekin baad main supreme court ne is yachika kaa nistaaran kar diya
 According to the ASG, now the High Court is hearing the case considering the matter as contempt of court
 aise main supreme court apane aadesh ke bare main spasht kare ki aakhir ye chhot sirf usee saal ke liye thi yaa aage bhi lagu rahegi
 Significantly, on August 17, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Dahi Handi in Maharashtra and upheld the decision of the Bombay High Court
 iske mutabik, isamen 18 saal se kam umr ke bachche bhaag nahin lenge or dahi handi kii oonchai 20 foot se zyada nahin rahegi, haalanki supreme court ne kaha tha ki vah maamle kii aktubar main sunwaayee jari rakhega
 Earlier in the hearing, the Supreme Court issued notice to petitioner Swati Patil against Dahi Handi
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki puraani yachika kaa nistaaran ho chukaa he
 The petition is being resumed
 supreme court maharashtra sarkaar kii dahi-handi ke maamle main daakhil arji par sunwaayee kar rahaa tha
 The comments rajya sarkaar ne supreme court se 2014 ke adeshon main spashtataa dene kii guhaar lagaai thi, jisamen 12 saal tak ke bacchon ko dahi-handi main hissaa lene kii ijaajat di gai thi or saath hi hoicourt ke 20 foot kii oonchai simit karne ke aadesh par roak laga di thi
 The government says whether this order was for one year or is still in force? maharashtra sarkaar kii ore se ASG tushaar mehta ne supreme court ko bataaya tha ki 11 agast 2014 ko bombai hoicourt ne apane aadesh main kaha tha ki 18 saal se kam ke yuvak dahi-handi main hissaa nahin le sakate or isaki oonchai bhi 20 foot se zyada nahin honi chahie
 The organizers appealed to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court stayed the decision of the High Court allowing children up to 12 years of age to participate and also stayed the height order, but later the Supreme Court gave this Petition disposed
 ASG ke mutabik, ab hoicourt is maamle main adaalat kii avmaananaa kaa maamla maanate hue sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Supreme Court should clarify about its order that after all this exemption was only for the same year or will continue to apply
 isse pehle sunwaayee main supreme court ne dahi handi ke khilaaf yachikakarta swati patil ko notice jari kiya tha

 railway yatriyon kii lagaataar shikaayat ke baadarel mantralaub dallalon par nakel kasne ke lierel tiktbooking ke tareeke main bada badlaav karne ja rahaa he
 Actually, the passengers were complaining that even after the tickets opened at eight in the morning, they could not get a confirmed ticket even if they reached there immediately
 railway ne is maamle kii jaanch kii or bahut hi chaunkaa dene vaale ghapale kaa padaarfash hua
 Internal investigation has revealed that 4,000 confirmed tickets were purchased by brokers within a minute of the computer reservation system opening every day
 dalal paisanger rigerveshan software kii ek suvidha kaa galat istemaal karke tikat book kar lete the or use oonche daam par yatriyon ko bech dete the
 Railway reservation software has a facility that if a person has purchased the first ticket, at the last minute he can change the details of his journey and book the tickets of other trains within a few seconds
 dalal ek din pehle hi kam lokapriy railgadiyon kii tikat kharid lete the or agle din subah aath se 8
 Between 01 am, the details changed and other popular trains such as Rajdhani, Duronto and others took long-distance train tickets
 aisa karne main unako sirf kuch second hi lagata tha, kyonki system main pehle se hi unka booking byora maujuud rahata tha
 Ajay Shukla, Member, Railway Board (traffic), said, 'brokers used to book tickets in advance one day in advance and change the ticket details the next day
 booking clerk ko sirf anya pienaar uplabdh karnaa hota tha, kyonki ek din pehle hi byora system main feed ho jaataa tha
 It took only a few seconds to change the ticket details
 hamane ab is suvidha ko system khulne ke pehle ghante ke liye disable kar diya he
 'the Railway Minister received a complaint that in this way a large number of tickets are booked every day
 iske baad jaanch shuru hui
 The investigation has also indicated that the booking clerk and others inside the racket were also involved
 railway mantralay ne ab doshiyon ko pakadaa or karrwai karne kii yojana banaai he
 Now the Railway Ministry has thought of an attempt to crack down on agents who have booked multiple tickets at once
 ab ek baar log-in kar ek hi tikat book kiya ja sakegaa
 E-ticket self-borne passengers will also have to log out and try again to book another ticket
 yah niyam sainikon ko chhodkar iarsitisi agenton samet sabhi par lagu hoga
 This rule will apply to the booking of e-tickets from 8 am to 12 noon, but this restriction will not be applicable for onward journey or return tickets
 railway board ke adhikari idhar kuch dinon se deshbhar main booking pattern par najar rakh rahe hai
 Now in the first minute, this change is being made in some places instead of the change in 4000 trips and trains as before

 80 loksabhaa siton vaalen upi main ek bhi muslim ummidavaar 2014 main jitkar nahin aayaa tha

 Market share of profits narendra modi sarkaar kii ore ganga nadi ko saaf karne ke liye 'namaami gange' kaaryayojna ko jorshor se shuru kiya gaya tha lekin is yojana ke tahat kachua gati se hi kaam ho paa rahaa he
 Of the five states through which the Ganga stream passes, four states have not even taken full part of the budget allocated under this head
 in rajyon main uttarakhand, uttar pradesh, bihar or pashchim bengal shaamil hai
 Apart from these, the river Ganges also flows through Jharkhand, but the area in which the Ganges flows in this state is only 70 kilometers in length
 ganga par aavantit raashi kaa puraa upyog nahibis hajaar karod ke bajet aavanton se shuru hui namaami gange pariyojna philhal chal to rahi he lekin isaki raftaar kaaphi dhimi he
 This speed also shows that if the states have not completed the budget allocated to the five states for various projects, they could not spend what they took
 is baat kii pushti kendriya jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne bhi kii he
 However, Uma also believes that the reasons for not being able to raise or spend the allocated funds are not technical negligence but technical problems
 uma bharti ne kaha ki pehle se jo tamaam kaaryayojanaayen rajya sarkarein chalaa rahi thim ab usase bilkul alag dhang se kaam ho rahaa he
 Therefore, old schemes are being closed and new schemes are being made and the method of implementation of them is also new
 isliye bhi deree ho rahi he lekin ham samay se apni kaaryayojna ko puri kar lenge
 According to Uma Bharti, the first phase of Ganga cleaning will be completed by 2018
 aise main june 2017 ke baad ganga saaf dikhne bhi lagegi
 The second phase of work is to begin from 2018, to be completed by 2020
 namaami gange project kii shuruyaat se hi iske bajet or kharch kii raashi main kaaphi antar rahaa he
 In 2014-15, a budget of Rs 2137 crore was approved and the amount allocated was Rs 2053 crore but the expenditure was only Rs 326 crore
 2015-16 main 1650 karod rupee kii raashi manjuur kii gai or kharch hone se 18 karod rupee batch gaye
 2500 crores has been approved this year
 lekin kharch kaa hisaab ab tak nahin mil paaya he
 'budget could not be spent for technical reasons' According to the source of the Ministry of Water Resources, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal have not fully utilized the funds sanctioned for themselves
 is bare main kendriya mantri uma bharti ne rajya or krend sarkaar ke bich talmil kii kami se inkaar karte hue kaha ki ganga par to puri duniya ekajute he
 These are the states of their own country, everyone agrees on Ganga
 lekin jaise hi naye sire se ban rahi yojanaon par kaam kii raftaar badhegi nattejey aane shuru ho jaaenge
 Experts have different opinions, however, experts have different opinions on this matter
 paryaavarnavid harish bahuguna kaa kahana he ki jab tak ganga yaa kisi bhi nadi kii gaad nikaalane kaa kaam sahi tareeke se or puri eemaandaaree se nahin hota tab tak satahi safai kaa koi matlab nahin he
 According to Bahuguna, the real cleaning is to improve the quality of Ganga water, to prevent sewage drains falling into it
 sarkaar kahati rahi he ki sivej ke jal kaa treetment karne ke baad use ganga main nahin daalaa jayega
 In such a situation, the question arises that if we will extract a large amount of water from the Ganges but if we do not return treated water, then how will the river flow and how will it move forward? baharhaal ye sabhi sawaal bhi ganga kii manthar dhara main hi behate ja rahe hai

 upi chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan abhi bhale hi naa hua ho, lekin samaajawaadee party kii ore se siem pad ke ummidavaar ko lekar siyaasi ghamaasan machaa hua he
 After the cabinet minister Shivpal Yadav in UP, it has now been announced by the Samajwadi Party that Akhilesh Yadav will be the CM candidate of the party in the coming elections
 isse pehle ravivaar ko shivpal yadav ne kaha tha ki agali baar chunaav main samaajawaadee party ko spasht bahumat milane par vah khud akhilesh yadav ke naam kaa prastaav siem pad ke liye karenge
 With these two statements, a period of speculation has started in the political circles of UP
 kyonki, ye bayaan sapa mukhiyamulaayam singh yadavake us bayaan ke baad aae hai, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki vidhansabha chunaav main party kaa mukhyamantri cheharaa tay nahin he
 Not only this, Shivpal himself said last Saturday that some people get everything by inheritance and luck
 shivpal kaa yah bayaan chachaa-bhattije ke bich jari siyaasi jang kii agali kadi tha
 In such a situation, Shivpal's recent statement of goodwill towards Akhilesh and the statement of the party's national general secretary Kiranmay Nanda the next day gives many clues, in which he said that SP will win the next election and Akhilesh Yadav will become the CM
 aaie, jaanate hai ki akhilesh ko siem ummidavaar ke taur par project karne yaa nahin karne se rajya kii maujuuda sattarudh samaajawaadee party ko kya phayda or nuksaan ho saktaa he
 As Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has tried to present himself as a development man among the people of the state
 agar chunaav main samaajawaadee party haar jaati he, to iskaa sara dosha akhilesh par madha ja saktaa he
 This will cause a lot of damage to Akhilesh's image
 samaajawaadee partiagar chunaav main akhilesh yadav ko project nahin karti he, jaisaa haal main mulaayam singh ne sanket diya tha, to party akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar main kiye gaye vikaas ke kaaryon ko janata ke bich sahi tareeke se prachaarit nahin kar paaegi or isse sapa ko bada nuksaan ho saktaa he
 If Akhilesh Yadav is not projected as CM or does not get the right to elect candidates, the crisis within the party will deepen
 party ko iskaa nuksaan chunaav main uthaanaa padaa saktaa he
 CM Akhilesh is very popular among the youth in Yadavasube
 yuvaaon ke liye unhone tamaam yojanaayen bhi chalaai hai
 In such a situation, the young voters can go away from the Samajwadi Party due to the lack of attention to the CM
 haal ke dinon main tamaam chunaavon main aise voter kaaphi nirnaayak sabit hue hai
 In such a situation, the Samajwadi Party may suffer
 vikaspurush ke alaava akhilesh yadav kii image ek aise siem ke taur par banaai gai he, jo jati-dharm se upar uthakar kaam karata he or mafia ko kisi surat main bardaasht nahin karata
 The reason for differences between uncle and nephew in the Yadav family has also been the merger of the Quami Ekta Dal into the SP and the inclusion of ministers accused of corruption in the government
 aise main agar akhilesh ko siem candidet ghoshit nahin kiya jaataa he, to duusari party is maukey kaa bakhubi phayda uthaaengi
 While the BSP has prepared a dent in the sp's Muslim vote bank, the BJP is eyeing Dalit voters

 a number of cases have also come up for divorce
 lekin ab ek aisa maamla saamne aayaa he jo ek tarah se chaunkaane vaala he
 When a husband and wife arrived in court for divorce in Birbhum, West Bengal, the judge advised them to stay in the hotel for 3 days at their expense
 or uske baad kuch aisa hua ki jise chamatkaar kaha ja saktaa he
 The husband and wife were compromised and divorced
 news 18 kii khabar ke mutabik, birbhum ke gautam das or ahana kii shaadi march 2016 main hui thi, lekin kuch hi samay baad donon ke rishte main takaraar kii naubat aa gai
 After which Ahana returns to her home
 2018 kii shuruyaat main hi donon ke bich maamla or bhi bigadaa to ahana ne apane saas-sasur ke khilaaf utpeedan kaa maamla darj kar diya
 Recently both of them filed for divorce in court
 lekin 16 janvari ko jab sunwaayee hui, to jaj parth saarthi ne donon ko aapas main sulah kii salaah di
 He said that the two stayed well away from their family for three-four days in the hotel and then talk
 lekin pati ne is ofer ko yah kahkar thukraa diya ki uske paas paise nahin he
 Later Judge Parth Sarthi said that he is ready to pay all the expenses of the hotel
 lekin bahes ke bich hi sarkari vakil ranjit ganguli ne kaha ki kharchaa vah uthaaenge
 After this, orders were given from the judge to provide protection to the husband and wife
 birbhum main hi ek hotel book karavaaya gaya, or maamla sulajh gaya
 As a result, the divorce was canceled
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main talaak ke kai tareeke ke maamle saamne aae hai
 In which divorces were being made through Facebook, whatsapp and other social media platforms
 jhabua kaa aadmi bhale hi sahishnu-ashishnu nahin samajhataa, lekin vah bhukh, garibi or badahaal jindagi ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhataa (sahataa) he
 These words are much heavier for him than the first two words
 uske liye partiyon ke myne haath kaa panja or camel kaa phool ke pratikon kii tarah hi he, lekin use pataa he ki uski sarkaar usase kahin dur dilli or bhopal main baithi he, or itani dur se uske paas na to yojanaayen pahunch paati hai or na hi ve mantriyon tak pahunch pate hai

 kiran banaam kejariwal kii jamini hakeekat kaa hamane jayja liya, or shuruyaat un auto waalon se kii, jinhen 'aap', yani aam aadmi party kaa samarthak mana jaataa he
 Believe me, only two people were found in the crowd of about 20-25 autos, whose intention was waived in the name of Kiran Bedi, or rather, whose faith was shaken by Arvind Kejriwal
 baaki sabaki jubaan par aaj bhi arvind kejariwal hi raaj karte najar aae
 Some even raised the slogan, "the broom will go, the dust will fly
" 
 
 na rahegaa panja, na khilegaa phool
 
 
 " aisa nahin he ki kisi ne kiran bedi kii eemaandaaree ko kathghare main khadaa kiya, lekin unhen apana netaa maanane se inkaar karte najar aae
 Said, the leader is honest, but the party is not well
 hamane iraadaa bana rakhaa he, ek mauka usko hi denge, jo hamaari baat karata he
 Then, why not take the hearts of those slum dwellers who are being considered as the vote bank of the Aam Aadmi Party
 ham pahunche minto road kii ek jhuggi main, jo kalibari mandir ke thik peeche he
 Talked to the tea person, that our care takes only one, which also guarantees that no one will take bribe from you
 jab 49 din kii sarkaar thi to koi bhi police vaala free kaa kuch nahin letaa tha, ab to phir purana hi haal he
 In the name of Kiran Bedi, the slum people who are your voters are not seen much
 haa, bijepi kii taraf iraadaa usne hi jaahir kiya, jisane pichley chunaav main bhi bijepi ko hi vot kiya tha, yani kattar samarthak
 Even in the slum, the light of the beam is not seen
 10-12 logon se baat kii to teen bijepi ke paksh main dikhe, lekin bedi ke naam par nahin, modi or bhaajapa ke naam par
 Now the next stop was the street vendors
 pahunch gaye aarake puram ke paas hafte main ek din road kinare lagane vaali mandi par
 Talking to about 30 shopkeepers indicated that if there is any BJP, then only the BJP will vote
 nahin to kiran bedi ke naam ne kisi ke iraade ko asamanjas main philhal to nahin daalaa he
 
 
 So here too Kiran was missing from the tongue of the street vendors
 maano sabakaa dil kejariwal ne pehle hi jeet rakhaa ho
 Not everyone forgets the motive behind voting
 rishwatakhori band ho gai, hamaari rehadi waalon ko koi police vaala pareshaan nahin karata tha, or kya chahie
 Who cares about our livelihood, who stopped the bribe, our leader is the same

 His image is also stated in the voters of Delhi as well as the support of the BJP which won the most seats in the last election and also in the Lok Sabha, the party captured all the seven seats of Delhi
 lihaaja chand logon kii raay par yah nishkarsh nikaalnaa shaayad jaldbaaji hogi ki jitegaa koun or haaregaa koun? Sachin Tendulkar's record of 100 international centuries never seems to break, but this star batsman believes that either Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma can break his record
 tendulkar (39 varsh)ne yah baat tab kahi jab bollywood star salmaan khan ne mumbai main ek party ke dauraan unase yah sawaal kiya
 The party was organized in honor of 100 centuries of Mumbai Indians owner Mukesh Ambani Netendulkar
 salmaan ke bhaashan main hasya kaa put tha or isamen tab sabhi kii hansi foot padi jab unhone tendulkar ko is sawaal par gherna shuru kiya ki kya unke abhedya lag rahe ricard ko koi tod paaegaa
 The Bollywood star said, 'what do you think? Speak upright will not break
 ’ tendulkar bhi is par apni hansi nahin roak paye
 He said, 'I think those who can break are sitting in this hall
 ’is par salmaan kaa jawaab tha, ‘chance hi nahin he
 Tendulkar said, "I have seen these young players
 viraat or rohit inamen shaamil hai
 i will not be sad if an Indian breaks it
 ’salmaan ne tendulkar kii uplabdhi ke sandarbh main kaha, ‘mujhe ummid he ki yah ricard jald tut jayega kyonki ricard tuutane ke liye hote hai
 Sachin man, how do you feel hearing praise all the time
 aapako aisa nahin lagata he ki ‘thik he
 i know all this
 yah paryaapt he
 'all laughed at this
 yah abhinayta yaheen par nahin rukaa
 Salman further said, 'what about 200
 yah kaisaa rahegaa
 100 has been made, how much time will it take to become another 100? ’iske baad unhone jo gugali phenki usase phir hansi kaa fawwara foot padaa
 It has been heard that it is impossible to break Sachin's record and it is not a don, i am speaking
 main aisa isliye kah saktaa hum ki mere pita ne us film kii script likhi thi
 Amit ji (amitabh Bachchan) acted in it
 ’is party ke aaksharn sachin tendulkar ko ‘sachin sar’ kahkar sambodhit karne vaali priyanka chopra ne jab is star ballebaaj ke bare main baat kii to adhiktar hansi hi nikalati hi rahi
 Sachin meanwhile was sitting between Mukesh and Nita Ambani
 film jagat, purv or vartmaan cricketron ke alaava raajnneetigyon ne bhi master blaster kii jamkar tarif kii
 Salman ended his speech in a funny manner
 unhone kaha, ‘aap saubhagyashaalee ho ki maine apana samay studio main bitaayaa nahin to phir is samay aapke sthaan par main hota or ye shatak mere naam hote
 'later when Tendulkar was invited to take the insignia from Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan
 is avasar par vah bhi priyanka chopra ko unhen ‘sar’ kehane ke liye chhedane se baj nahin aaye
 Tendulkar said, 'I don't know what i should say when you call me Sachin sir
 maine haal main apana heirstil yah sochakar badla ki main thodaa yuva dikhaai duungaa lekin lagata he isse kaam nahin bana
 'sachin said about the one-year wait for 99 to 100 century,' The journey from 99 to 100 century was very long but it was not under my control
 ’mahaan gayika lata mangeshkar bhi is avasar par maujuud thim or unhone us din ko yaad kiya jab tendulkar se unki pehali mulaakaat hui thi
 On this occasion, Sachin asked Lata to hum his favorite song and even this great singer could not turn down his request and he played the song 'tu Jahan Jahan Chale, Mera Saaya Saath Hoga' from the movie 'mera Saaya'
 aamir khan ne is kaarykram ke dauraan tendulkar ko ‘behtareen insaan’ bataaya or kaha, ‘main sisiai main ek film kii shooting kar rahaa tha or shaam main bhartiya team nets par abhyaas ke liye aayi
 i was talking to seniors and a little 14 year old boy playing on the nets
 main soch rahaa tha ki ye baccha kahaan se ghus gaya indian team ke nets main
 'he said,' i couldn't stop myself and i was watching the bowlers bowling him
 vah gend kaa saamana acchhee tarah kar rahaa tha or sachmuch achche stroke khel rahaa tha
 i could not resist talking to seniors and i asked them who is this child? Then i was told that he is Sachin and he can join the Indian team
 ’aamir ne kaha, ‘aapke bare main yah cheez kaaphi shandaar he ki aapke naam itani sari uplabdhiyaan hai or ab 100waan antarrashtriya shatak bhi
 Even after achieving all this, you are a great person
 aap jis sughadta se apni jindagi, apane khel or apane parivaar ko chalaa rahe hai, yah shandaar he
 Abhishek Bachchan was also present on the occasion along with his wife and actress Aishwarya
 unhone tendulkar ke 100wein antarrashtriya shatak ke bare main ek dilachasp baat kahi
 He said, 'it is needless to say that we also had a lot to do with your 100th century
 sabhi bhartiya cricket prashansakon ne ek se hi kapade pahane, ham sabhi ek hi pojishan main baithe rahe, hamane ek sa hi khaanaa khaaya, maine bhi vishwa cap ke dauraan yahi kiya
 We have also played a big role since the 100th century, because it was only due to our prayers and superstition that you can score 100th century

 In Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party (SP), which came to power with an absolute majority after the Assembly elections, has come under threat of discontinuation of some schemes launched in the time of Abamayawati government and withholding the funds of some schemes
 mayawatine apane kaarykaal ke dauraan graamy vikaas vibhaag main kuch yojanaon kii shuruyaat kii thi, jisamen mahamaya awaas yojana or mahamaya sarvajan awaas yojana, kanshiram awaas yojana, kanshiram shahari samgr vikaas yojana shaamil hai
 Along with this, Ambedkar Village Development Scheme was also started by Mayawati, under which an attempt was made to give a lot of shine to the villages declared Ambedkar Village
 haalanki gaavon ko chamakaane ke naam par thekedaaron ne jamkar lut machaai thi
 After the formation of the SP government, there are now signs that these schemes can be closed or the funds released to these schemes can be stopped
 mayawati ne indira awaas yojana kii tarj par hi mahamaya awaas yojana kii shuruyaat varsh 2007-08 main kii thi, jiske tahat keval anusuchit jati tathaa janajati ke garib pariwaron ko hi awaas mil saktaa he
 Similarly, the previous Mayawati government started the Mahamaya Sarvajan Awas Yojana in the year 2008-09 under which only people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Castes get the benefit
 yojana ke tahat labhaarthi ko 45 hajaar rupee die jate hai
 If the rural development officers are to be believed, then the question of lacquer is that now why would the SP government want to publicize the schemes being run in the name of the head of the previous BSP government, so now there are indications from the government that these schemes are coming in the coming days Can be locked in
 graamy vikaas vibhaag ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki garib pariwaron ko awaas uplabdh karaane ke liye pehle se hi indira awaas yojana kii vyavastha he
 Now at any cost, the new government will not want the former government to be praised by running schemes in the name of Mahamaya
 adhikari ne bataaya ki sarkaar main is baat ko lekar manthan chal rahaa he ki mahamaya ke naam par chal rahi yojanaon ko band kar diya jaae yaa inhen duusare ke naam par chalaaya jaae
 Political analyst and senior journalist Abhayanand Shukla says that there is a possibility that the schemes started during Mayawati's tenure can be put on hold or the funds released in the name of the schemes can be stopped
 shukla kehete hai ki yah thik usee prakaar ho saktaa he jaise mayawati ne satta main aate hi lakhanu main bane lohia park ko darkinar kar sara dhyaan ambedkar park or murtiyon par laga diya tha
 Similarly, the SP government should also make plans regarding its great men, so it should not be a surprise
 is bich bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki anusuchit jati or janajati tathaa ambedkar ke naam par chal rahi yojanaon ko nai sarkaar ke liye band karnaa aasaan nahin hoga kyonki sabase adhik 50 dalit vidhayak sapa se hi jitkar vidhansabha pahunche hai
 In his statement to a parliamentary committee, former Governor of Reserve Bank, Raghuram Rajan has warned that several schemes of the Modi government like Mudra loan, Kisan Credit Card can worsen the banks' KNPA
 raghuraaman rajan ne bainkon ke vishaal non parforming asset (NPA) ke liye upie sarkaar ko jimmedaar to tehraaya hi he, modi sarkaar ko bhi koi clin chit nahin di he
 He also described many schemes of Modi government as enhancing NPA
 loksabhaa kii akalan samiti ne purv governor se kamity ke saamne pesh hone or bainkon ke enpie par apana paksh rakhane ke liye kaha tha
 The committee had also given permission to Rajan to put his side through the letter after which Raghuram Rajan gave his reply to the Lok Sabha committee in a sequential manner on the NPA
 raghuram rajan ne kaha, ' sarkaar ko agle sankat ke liye jimmedaar ho sakane vaale sroton par bhi dhyaan dena chahie
 Especially the government should avoid ambitious debt targets or debt waivers
 'unhone mudra lone, kisaan credit, emsamai credit guarantee jaisi yojanaon ko enpie badhaane vaale nae sroton ke rup main bataaya
 Significantly, PM Modi and NDA government see the scheme like money loan scheme as a major motivator of employment generation
 rajan ne chetavanee dete hue kaha, 'mudra lone or kisaan credit card lokapriy to hai, lekin inase karj jokhim badhane kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue inkaa gahanta se pareekshan karnaa hoga

 ' We saw a lot of reactions after the 2015 Cricket World Cup defeats in the final
 har tarah ke bayaan-vichaar dekhne ko mili jinamein tarif kam or gussa zyada tha
 In a country where it is like a cricket religion, it was bound to happen
 iske alaava bharat kii lagaataar jeet ke kaaran bhi cricket premiyon ke man main yah bhaavana bhar gai thi ki hamaari team yah cap jeet sakati he
 It is true that we not only won seven matches, but in every match, we dismissed the rival team
 isse yah vishwaas man main ghar kar gaya ki ham kisi ko bhi haraa sakate hai jo sach nahin tha
 We had forgotten that this was Australia who beat us continuously, both in Tests and also in One Day
 lagaataar haar ke us silsile ko kinare rakhte hue dhoni ne jis tarah se team ko phir se urjavan banaaya, use bhi ham bhul gaye
 We also forgot that before the start of the World Cup, we were not even in the competition
 1983 kii hi tarah mana ja rahaa tha ki bharat jaldi hi waapas aayega
 But Dhoni has to be praised for bringing back a defeated and weak looking team
 bina kisi tarah ke dabaav main aae unhone apane khilaadiyon kaa manobal badhaayaa
 He improved his weak side bowling and encouraged the fast bowlers to do something
 tej gendbaaji ke liye bharat kabhi bhi nahin janaa jaataa tha lekin dhoni ne apane gendbaajon par bharosa jataakar unase vah karvaa liya jo lagbhag asambhav tha
 Our fast bowlers became the subject of discussion and everyone was praised
 kisi bhi world cap main bharat kii ore se tej gendbaajon ne sabase zyada wicket chatkain or iskaa andaja isi se lagata he ki akele mohammad shami ne is toornament main 17 vicketen leen
 Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma also did wonders
 umesh ne to sabase adhik 18 wicket liye jinamein 4 australia ke hi the
 Dhoni made him a great bowler by using Mohit Sharma cleverly
 in teenon kii safalataa kaa shrey dhoni ko jaataa he jinhone un par vishwaas rakhaa or unke liye sateek ranneeti banaai
 He reposed trust in every player and rarely uttered bitter words about him
 yah dhoni kii behtareen captaini or team work kaa udhaaharan he ki bharat is world cap main dekhte hi dekhte daavedaar ban gaya
 Dhoni led the team to heights that were not imagined
 is baar bhi unka prayaas saraahneey rahaa
 What can the captain do if some important player does not play against Australia
 dhoni ne team ko bure score se baahar nikaalane kii puri koshish kii or sabase zyada ran banaae
 What else can you expect from a captain? Dhoni has established himself as the best captain of the tournament and it is a big achievement
 dhoni par hamen garv hona chahie
 The game should be played in the spirit of the game and it should be kept away from mania

 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi has got an entry in national politics, but opposition to him has started differences not only in NDA but also in BJP, under his leadership
 virodh kii vajah se vasundhara raaje kii chunavi rath yatra main modi kaa kaarykram sthagit kar diya gaya
 Modi's entry was made in the bjp's Delhi Durbar, but in the states called bjp's strongholds, there was no entry board for Modi
 2014 kii chunavi ranneeti main sangh or bijepi ne modi ke dabadabe ke saamne hukum bajaanaa jaruri samajha, lekin bijepi ke duusare kshatrapon ne modi kii saraparasti ko nakaarne kii shuruyaat kar di
 The bjp's civil war started with Rajasthan in Rajasthan, where Vasundhara Raje, who was on a Suraj Sankalp Yatra, taking all the 200 seats in the state on Thursday, did not agree to call Modi at her rally
 vasundhara kii rath yatra ke dauraan pehali raily main bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh shaamil honge, to sushamaa swaraj kii maujuudagi main yatra khatm hogi
 Not only this, LK Advani and Arun Jaitley will also be involved in the second phase of the rath yatra
 bijepi kii rajasthan ikai ne saaf kar diya ki dilli kaa takht hasil karne ke liye bhale hi party modi ko turup kaa ikkaa maan rahi ho, lekin rajasthan kaa raaj phir se hasil karne ke liye maharani ke hukum ko hi maananaa padegaa
 Now the question is, why is the Queen avoiding Modi's entry in Rajasthan after all? Why does Vasundhara want to stay away from Modi? Vasundhara is trying to hit Modi with four arrows by not calling Modi in a rally
 pehla vasundhara nahin chaahatin ki unke siyaasi sho ko modi lut len, doosraa gujarat chunaavon ke dauraan vasundhara ko modi ne nahin bulaayaa, to vasundhara ne modi ko naa kah diya
 Third, Vasundhara Gehlot wants to cash in on the anger of the minorities against the government
 lihaaja wo nahin chaahatin ki modi kii vajah se alpsankhyak vot kaa dhruvikaran ho
 Fourth, by keeping distance from Modi, Vasundhara does not want to lag behind in strengthening her secular image
 haalanki modi ko lekar vasundhara se sawaal kiya gaya to unhone use taalna hi behatar samajha
 Actually, 10 minorities died due to police firing in Gopalgarh case of Rajasthan, due to which there is a lot of resentment among the minorities about the Gehlot government
 vasundhara isi gusse ko bhunaanaa chaahati hai, taaki udaipur ke ilaakon main nirnaayak kahi jane vaali 30 vidhansabha siton par alpsankhyakon kaa vot wo le saken
 It is clear that the question about the attitude of the Muslim community to Modi does not seem to end at the moment
 bijepi kaa ek dhada bhale hi modi ko piem pad kaa ummidavaar banane kii maang kar rahaa ho, lekin dilli kii gaddi par baithne se pehle modi ko apane ghar main bhi ladaai jeetni padegi

 We are talking about Mohammed Rafi
 24 disambar 1924 ko punjab ke amritsar main janme rafee sahab ne mumbai aakar saal 1944 main pehali baar hindi film ke liye geet gaaya tha or us film kaa naam tha ‘gaanv kii gori’tha
 Today on the occasion of his birthday, know some special things related to him- - kya aap jaanate hai ki mohammad rafee ne takreeban 26 hajaar gane gaae the
 In the year 1946, the film 'anmol Ghadi' got recognition from 'tera Toy Broken' after which he did not look back
 - us samay jab rafee gaaya karte the sambhawatah vahi ekmaatr aise gayak the, jinhone kisi duusare play-bek singer ke liye geet gaae
 Manab Mora Bawra in the film 'ragini' and 'ajab Hai Dastan Teri Yeh Zindagi' in the film 'prank'
 
 
 ' geet kishor ke liye rafee ne gaae the
 - It is said that Rishi Kapoor wanted Kishore Kumar to sing for him in the film 'laila Majnu', but Madan Mohan chose Mohammad Rafi
 rafee ko itnaa saraahaa gaya ki iske baad rafee hi rishi kapur kii aawaaj ban gaye
 - When Mohammed Rafi died, there was a lot of rain in Mumbai
 logon ne kaha ki unki maut par maa saraswati thi ro rahi thim
 On that day, at least 10,000 people were on the streets in Rafi Saheb's last visit, despite the heavy rains in Mumbai
 - kya aap jaanate hai ki 'babul kii duaen leti ja' geet ko gaate vakt rafee kai baar roe
 The reason behind this was that his daughter got engaged a day before recording this song
 jiske chalate rafee sahab kaaphi bhavuk the
 He received the 'national Award' for this song sung in such sentimentality
 - rafee sahab ko 6 filmphere or 1 neshnal award mila
 He was awarded the 'padma Shri' by the Government of India
 rafee ne kai bhartiya bhashaaon main geet gaae, jaise- konkani , asami, punjabi, marathi, oriya, bengali or bhojpuri
 Apart from this, Rafi Sahab also sang songs in Parsi, Dutch, Spanish and English
 tippaniyan Very few people are aware that Mohammed Rafi's nick name was 'fiko'
 bachapan main ve raah chalate fakiron ko suna karte the or vahiin se rafee sahab ne gaanaa shuru kar diya
 Perhaps this is the reason why Mohammad Rafi was also very kind
 kehete hai ki ve gane ke liye kabhi bhi fees lene par charchaa nahin kiya karte the
 Sometimes even songs were given for 1 rupee
 - suron ke sartaaj mohammad rafee ne sabase zyada duat gane aashaa bhosle ke sang gaae hai
 Mohammad Rafi suffered a heart attack on 31 July 1980 and said goodbye to this world
 - kya aap jaanate hai ki mohammad rafee ne takreeban 26 hajaar gane gaae the
 In the year 1946, the film 'anmol Ghadi' got recognition from 'tera Toy Broken' after which he did not look back
 - us samay jab rafee gaaya karte the sambhawatah vahi ekmaatr aise gayak the, jinhone kisi duusare play-bek singer ke liye geet gaae

 The BJP has also issued a 3 line whip regarding this
 isse pehle khabar ai thi ki sarkaar loksabhaa satr 10 din ke liye badha sakati he kyonki is satr main modi sarkaar kai lambit bill paas karwaanaa chaahati he
 The bill will be tabled in the Lok Sabha on Thursday to discuss triple talaq
 centre sarkaar pehle hi loksabhaa main yah bill pesh kar chuki he
 The government's effort is to get this bill passed
 modi sarkaar ne pichhali baar bhi is bill ko loksabhaa main paas kara diya tha, jiske baad ise rajyasabha bheja gaya
 The Central Government could not pass this bill due to minority in Rajya Sabha
 vipakshi partiyon ne is bill ko waapas select cameti ke paas bhejne kii maang kii thi, haalanki is maang ko sarkaar ne khaarij kar diya tha
 In the Lok Sabha, several opposition parties including the Congress, Samajwadi Party and Asaduddin Owaisi's party majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen have been opposing the law on triple talaq
 isse pehle loksabhaa main bill pesh hone ke dauraan congress shashi tharur ne kaha tha ki yah vidheyak ne muslim mahilaon ko koi laabh nahin pahunchayegaa, unhone kaha ki muslim mahilaon kii suraksha ke bajaay, vidheyak muslim purushon kaa apradheekaran karata he
 At the same time, Owaisi also stated the triple talaq bill against Muslim men and against the basic spirit of the Constitution
 unhone kaha tha ki hindu vivaah adhinium ke tahat agar koi purush apni patni ko chodta he, to use ek saal kii jail kaa praavdhaan he
 Why is such a provision being made that Muslim men will be punished in this crime for three years more stringent

 The police came to know that there was a fight between the two last evening as well

 On Zakir Naik's apology, Deputy CM p Ramasamy said that he (zakir Naik) did not apologize wholeheartedly

 At the same time, some Indians also performed against Zakir Naik in Malaysia

 In Malaysia, he has been banned from making speeches in public meetings in view of national security

 Naik had said in the statement, 'the rights of Hindus living in Malaysia are 100 times more than the Muslims living in India
 ' usne chini samudaay ko bhi desh chhodkar jane ko kaha tha
 However, on Tuesday, he apologized for the statement and said that the statement was misinterpreted

 Efforts are on to extradite him

 53-year-old Zakir Naik left India 3 years ago and fled to Muslim-majority Malaysia, where he got permanent citizenship

 However the Malaysian PM had said that he would not be extradited as he was not causing any trouble

 The event of the 75th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was held at the KD Jadhav Indoor Stadium
 raja baraar ne kaha ki purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ek vichaar hai, ve hamaare dilon main rahenge

 agar chhattisgarh main chunaav se pehle ke ghatnakram ko ek lafj main bayaan karnaa ho, to vah lafj haih gahamagahami
 Consider: Rumors had it that the Congress was trying to tie up with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and merge former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) with the Congress, but only on 20 September it was announced that the BSP and The JCC has joined hands
 ek pakhwaade baad kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki jogi rajnandagaanv se mukhyamantri dow
 Raman Singh will contest, but then the JCC chief announced that he will not contest the election and put all the speculations to a halt
 phir 21 aktubar ko jogi ne kaha ki ve marvaahee se chunaav ladenge jahaan se unke bete amit philhal vidhayak hai
 If someone is stable and firm on this changing plank, then they are lions

 singh bahut sakchati se chhattisgarh kii hukumat chalaate aa rahe hai or unki ranneetiyaan pichley chunaavon main kargar rahi hai
 But assuming the JCC-BSP as the X-factor or its unknown player, will the doctors be able to write the exact recipe of victory in 2018? According to the characteristics of the seat, the intervention of Chhattisgarh is a small state of 90 seats
 
 aise main harek nirvachan kshetra main ukvamidavaar sahit har choti-choti baat kaa prabandhan badi ahmiyat akhriyaar kar letaa he
 Singh's team is taking the tribal and general category seats of North and South Chhattisgarh separately, while the 10 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) of Central Chhattisgarh and the other 10 seats dominated by SC are taken separately

 In Dantewada, South Bastar, Chipra Karma, son of late Congress leader Mahendra Karma, who was killed in the Maoists attack in the Zeeram Valley in 2013, announced his election to contest against his mother and sitting Congress MLA Deoti Karma on a Samajwadi Party ticket

 Of the current 49 mlas, the BJP has cut 16 (more than 30 per cent) tickets
 2013 main party ne apane 50 main se 18 vidhayakon ke tikat kaate the
 Changing candidates is considered important to avoid anti-incumbency
 iske ulat congress ne 30 aktubar ko ghoshit 72 ummidavaaron kii apni fehrist main keval teen maujuuda vidhayakon ke tikat kaate
 This could prove beneficial for the BJP as in 2013 the Congress re-fielded 34 mlas and 27 of them lost the election
 alabatta khud apni hi mehnat par vaaki pani pherate hue bhaajapa ne kai maujuuda vidhayakon ke parivaar ke sadasyon ko tikat die hai
 Sanyogita, wife of Chandrapur MLA Yudhveer Singh Judeo, won the ticket from the same seat, while in Lalunga, BJP MLA Suniti Rathia was replaced by her husband Satyanand Rathia
 iske peeche manshaa yah he ki party ke bheetar baghawat kam se kam ho
 Of the 12 ministers of Chhattisgarh, only one minister, Ramshila Sahu, who comes from the powerful Sahu community, has been denied the candidature of the party

 The BJP currently has nine out of the 10 seats reserved for SC and on these seats, the party has fielded SC candidates who are considered to be the most popular among non-sc voters
 vah maanakar chal rahi he ki essi or sarvaadhik anya pichde virgon (embisi) main mayawati ke aadhaar ko dekhte hue congress se jude gaiyr-essi voton kaa koi bhi bantwaaraa basapa-jessisi ke phaayde main jayega
 The sc-dominated areas of Bilaspur and Durg divisions have tremendous potential for a triangular contest
 yahaan gaiyr-essi voton ke bhaajapa or congress ke bich bantane kii sambhaavna he
 In almost 45 seats, the SC vote is more than 10 percent, due to which the possibility of a triangular contest will increase if the BSP-JCC fielded strong candidates in these seats
 madhya chhattisgarh main raipur, bilaspur or durg kii shahari siten, ek yaa do mushkilon ke alaava, bhaajapa kii pakad main dikhti hai
 BJP think tanks are of the view that reversing some of the 2013 trends will be crucial to victory

 There were also four of the 12 seats in South Chhattisgarh

 The beneficiaries of SKY have been chosen very thoughtfully
 rajya ke pichley chunaavon ke vishleshan se pataa chalaa ki jab-jab baari voting hoti he, tab-tab bhaajapa ko phayda hota he
 The party also feels that the smartphone will boost its social media campaign
 vijan logon ke gale utaarnabhajapa na keval raman singh sarkaar kii pichhali uplabdhiyon kaa danka peet rahi he, balki bhavishya ke vaade bhi kar rahi he
 The party has issued a vision document - Atal Darshan Patrakar, in which voters are told what and how it will do to make Chhattisgarh a prosperous state by 2025
 singh kehete hai, "saamaajik or aarthik suchakaankon main jahaan bade sudhaar aae hai, vahiin vijan dastavej main hamaare vaade ginaae gaye hai ki ham bhavishya main kya hasil karnaa chaahate hai
 "apart from this, special strategies have also been made focused on the region
 uttar chhattisgarh ke kuch nishchit adivasee nirvachan kshetron, masalan jashpur, patthalgaanv or conkari, main bhaajapa ko dharm badalakar isai dharm apnaane or nahin apnaane vaale adivaasiyon ke bich dhruvikaran kaa abhiyaan chalaate kai logon ne dekha he
 The party has also introduced the Pathalgarhi resistance movement in Jashpur district as a church-sponsored revolt
 aam logon kii najar se dekhen, to chhattisgarh main bhrashtachar, berogari or araajaktaa kaa bolbalaa he
 But being an opposing party, the Congress has failed to convert them into electoral issues
 duusari taraf, congress ko bhaajapa phek sex sidi cond or sharabbandi sareekhe muddon main uljhaae rakhane main kaamyaab rahi he
 But even bjp's biggest optimists see Chhattisgarh as a state where the name of the Congress was the most popular in the minds of voters till a decade or so ago
 yahi vah baat he jiske chalate bhaajapa kii tel-pani dekar chaak-chauband banaai gai chunavi mashin kii chunauti se darpesh congress iske baavjood mukaable main bani hui he
 Even for the BJP, where the margin of victory has been steadily decreasing since the 2003 assembly elections, when the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are hovering, the challenges and bets are only going to increase
 vidhansabha chunaav kaa sidhaa asar loksabhaa ke chunaav par padana tay he kyonki donon ke bich kareeb chah maheene kaa hi samay shesh hoga
 Therefore, both BJP and Congress will try to enrich their further prospects
