nan ne is samay nai dilli main sharan le rakhi he jahaan rajya sarkaar ne ek police team ko bhej rakhaa he
 At the same time, the state government has also assured all possible help and security to the nuns and urged them to come to Orissa to identify the culprits
 chennai kii tasviren dekhi or 26 july 2005 yaad aa gaya
 After noon on 26 July, it seemed something big was going to happen, the rain was not stopping, the situation deteriorated by the evening, it was decided to spend the night in the office
 itnaa hi nahin raatbhar kaam bhi karnaa padegaa
 At night, i tried hard to get from Nariman Point to the suburbs of Mumbai, but could not succeed
 pani ne saare raste roak liye the
 There was a power outage in our second office located in the suburb and the connection was halted
 puri raat jahaan tak ja sake vahaan ja kar pani se bhare ilaakon kii reporting jari thi
 Looked like it would be fine by morning
 subah-subah mahanagar palika ke ek afasar kaa phone aayaa ki ve helicopter se madad baantne ja rahe hai, maine poocha kya sthiti itani kharaab he? unhonen kaha lag to rahaa he
 When reached, said that if the reporter and the cameraman would come, we would have to remove help
 phir tay kiya gaya ki sirf cameraman jayega
 When he returned after an hour and a half, the pictures he saw were hard to believe
 mumbai membarish kapani bharne se baccha-baccha waakif he, lekin yahaan to jaise mumbai or arab sagar main fark hi najar nahin aa rahaa tha, pataa chal gaya ki kuch ghanto main khatm hone vaali ye aapadaa nahin he
 Mumbai was suffering the result of the mess that has happened to Mumbai in the name of development
 26 july ko pani kaa risaav hote hi tatkaaleen mukhyamantri vilasarav deshmukh ne turant ek press conference kar bataaya ki mumbai main 966 mem barish hui thi or us parasarkaar kakoi control nahin tha
 Constructions without any plans asked them when control could have been done so that there is no loss, people should have reached the help at the earliest, after all 400 people lost their lives? He admitted that there is a lack of disaster management in Mumbai, as well as illegal and no planned construction has made this situation in Mumbai
 sabase zyada nuksaan mithi nadi (naam kii hi nadi) ke aas-paas ilaakon main hua tha
 The construction around it strangled the river carrying rain water into the sea
 jisaki vajah se aas-paas ke ilaakon main pani ghusaa tha
 Disaster management cell created by the government decided and decided to take measures to prevent this from happening again
 kam se kam elaan to kiya
 It was mainly decided that an action plan for disaster management should be prepared
 mumbaike storm water dren yani barish ke pani ko samandar se jodne vaale naalon ko chaudaa kiya jaae
 To make the Mithi river deep and wide, a plan should be made with fixed timelines
 iske baad 2007 tak mumbai mahanagarapalika main dizaster management cell banaaya gaya
 But if you look at the condition of other projects, it seems that Mumbai may still be the victim of rain like July 26, 2005
 project puraa hone kii ummid main mumbaib dekhiye bremastrowat project, darasal mumbai kii badhati aabaadi or aakaar dekhte hue 1993 main ye project shuru karne kii baat hui thi, lekin wo shuru hone ke liye 26 july 2005 ko hona padaa
 Under this project, Mumbai's drains were to be widened and deepened, 8 pumping stations were to be built in Mumbai, so that water could be pumped and released into the sea, a total of 58 important infrastructure projects were to be built
 ye sara kaam 2011 main khatm hona tha, lekin ab tak mahaj aadha kaam puraa hua he or project 2016 main khatm hoga aisa kaha ja rahaa he, is puure project kaa kharchaa bhi 1200 karod se bad kar 4000 karod tak pahunch chukaa he, ab bhi ye chaati thokkar koi nahin kah rahaa he ki ye 2016 main puraa hoga
 The same is the case with the Mithi River project, till the new government came, the current BJP MP Kirit Soumaiyya used to show the unfinished work of the Mithi project by traveling to the Mithi River in a boat in June every year to journalists
 is
 mumbai main baadh kaa khatrahaal hi main gavermental panel for climet change yani ipisisi ne jo report banaai, usamen duniya bhar ke 50 shaharon main se mumbai ko baadh ke khatre vaala doosraa sabase bada shahar bataaya gaya he
 According to this report, 28 million people of Mumbai are at risk of marine flooding and if nothing is done, the number will reach 10 million by 2070
 yani sthiti gambhir he or agar sarkaar kuch kadam uthaa bhi rahi he to wo naakaafi he
 Government's poor attitude responsible Mumbai's flood protection cover, the most natural armor mangroves to stop the threat of flood, is also slowly being removed and the government's poor attitude is responsible for this
 mumbai ke kinaaron par kareeb 5000 hectare mangrowj kaa cover hat rahaa he
 When the PIL was filed in the Bombay High Court on this matter, the court asked the Mumbai Mangroves cell to report on the status of the mangroves
 is report ke mutabik kai mangrowj ko hataakar vahaan mandir, sadak, jhopaden yahaan tak kii pakki imaaraten bhi banaai gai hai
 In many places, mangroves were removed by illegally loading debris
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki mumbai ke devlepment plan main barh kaa pani jamaa karne vaale flud plane par construction naa ho, iskaa koi vichaar tak nahin kiya gaya he
 There may be so much devastation in Chennai due to the rains of up to 350 mm on a single day, even if Mumbai still rains up to 100 mm in an hour, then the parrots of the metropolitan municipality and administration fly away
 haal hi main 19 june 2015 ko 280 mem barish se mumbai band pad gai thi
 It is clear that Mumbai has become only a drowning city and the situation of 26 July 2005 is likely to repeat itself if necessary steps are not taken immediately
 apane ghor pratidwandi narendra modi par prahaar karte hue bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki ek vyakti ne bijepi ko hijank kar liya he or us party ke adhyaksh bhi unke aagyaakaari ke rup main vyavhaar kar rahe hai

 The elections of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) are undoubtedly several months away, but Raj Thackeray's party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has started playing the Marathi card
 is baar inke nishane par navaratri mahotsav hai
 These festivals are mostly celebrated by the Gujarati community
 emenes ne navaratri mahotsavon ke sabhi aayojakon ko chetaya he ki agar wo biemasi kii jagah par aise aayojan karte hai to commercial rates ke hisaab se bhugtan karen
 Also, give half of the profits from such events to BMC
 'dandiya aayojanon kii aadhi kamai le biemasi'emeneska kahana he ki ganesh mandalon se ganpati mahotsavon ke aayojan or pramotion ke liye jis tarah biemasi fees leti he, usee tarah navaratri aayojakon se bhi lee jaani chahie
 Party councilor Sandeep Deshpande has written a letter to the BMC chief in this regard
 isamen maang kii gai he ki biemasi kodandiyajaise commercial aayojanon se hone vaali kamai ke kam se kam 50 fisadi hisse par apana daawa karnaa chahie
 The letter states that the Navratri organizers make big bucks from expensive tickets, advertisements and sponsorships

 BMC should not give up its legitimate revenue
 biemasi ko aise aayojakon se vigyaapan or binar lagane ke liye bhi fees leni chahie
 However, it has also been said in the letter that MNS is not against organizing the Navratri festival
 marathi log bhi isamen hissaa lete hai
 But the rules should be one for all

 donon timen siries main 1-1 se barabari par hai
 The first match played in Ranchi was won by India while the second match played in Guwahati was in the name of Australia
 hyderabad kaa uppal stadium pehali baar kisi tii-20 international match kii mejabani kar rahaa he
 This match between Team India and Australia is being hosted for the first time
 vanade siries main australia ko 4-1 se haraane ke baad bhartiya team tii-20 siries ko bhi jeet ke saath khatm karnaa chaahegi
 All the players in Team India are match winners, but there are 4 such players, who will be eyeing in today's match
 1
 Virat Kohliitim India captain Virat Kohli scored 90 *, 59 *, 50, 82 *, 27 * in the T20s before being dismissed for zero in Guwahati against Australia, so he kept his eyes on the failure of the last match against the Kangaroos
 If you forget, it will be on retaliation
 saath hi viraat kohli ko tii-20 international main sarvaadhik ran banane vaale ballebaajon kii list main duusare number par pahunchane ke liye 38 ranon kii darkaar he
 Kohli has 1,852 T20 runs to his name and he is only behind 1,889 at number two, Tillakaratne Dilshan
 brandan maikkalam 2,140 ranon ke saath sheersh par hai
 2
 rohit sharmakangaroon ke khilaaf vanade siries main team india ke 'hit main' rohit sharma kaa balla jam kar bolaa he
 Rohit Sharma has scored the highest 296 runs in ODI series against Australia
 jisamen ek shatak or do ardhashatak bhi shaamil he
 But in the first two matches of the T20 series against Australia, Rohit's bat has only 19 runs
 rohit sharma vaapasi karne main maahir hai, isliye aaj ke match main unke balle se kaaphi ran nikal sakate hai
 3
 bhubaneshwar kumarek baar phir australia ke shuruuaati wicket chatakaane kii jimmedaari team india ke swing king bhubaneshwar kumaar par hogi
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowled brilliantly in the last match played in Guwahati
 bhuvi ne 3 over kii gendbaaji main 9 sirf ran dekar aron finch kaa wicket hasil kiya tha
 During this time, his economy rate was 3
 hyderabad kaa uppal maidan bhuvi ko bahut raas aati he or vah is maidan kii pich se puri taraf waakif hai
 He has also been a Purple Cap winner in the last two series of the IPL (2016,2017)
 hyderabad main team india kaa siries jeetna kuch had tak bhubaneshwar kumaar par bhi nirbhar karegaa
 4
 jasprit bumrahaisisi ke number 2 tii-20 gendbaaj jasprit bumraah australia ke khilaaf maujuuda tii-20 siries main abtak 3 wicket hasil kar chuke hai or jesan behrendorf ne sabase zyada 4 wicket liye hai
 In such a situation, Bumrah can get the most wickets in the series by performing brilliantly in today's match
 isi ke saath hi vah tii-20 siries main ‘main of da siries’ aword ke liye bhi apana daawa majboot kar sakate hai
 At the same time, his eyes will also be on reaching number 1 in the ICC T20 bowlers rankings
 uttarakhand 9 november 2000 ko astitv main aayaa
 On November 9 this year, it will be 18 years after the formation of this state
 magar abhi tak uttarakhand kii apni sthai rajdhani nahin ban pai he
 Governments came
 
 She went
 lekin rajdhani ke intazaar main uttarakhand nivaasiyon kii ankhen abhi tak taras rahi hai
 In political duality, whether it is BJP or Congress, all are trying to deceive this state born of the movement
 2017 main baari janadesh ke baad pahaad kii bholi bhali janata ne bhaajapa ko chunaa
 Probably in the hope that this time they will definitely fulfill this demand
 magar is baar bhi pahaad ko nyaay milegaa isamen thodaa sanshay he, kyonki bhaajapa ke hi do dhuree nirnaayak apane alag-alag bayanon se ye sanshay paidaa kar rahe hai
 On the one hand BJP state president Ajay Bhattagarsain is talking about making the capital, while Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat is of the opinion
 vah khud garasain ko rajdhani na banaae jane kii baat karte hai jabaki garasain ko greeshmakaleen rajdhani banane ko lekar apane bayanon se charchit rahe hai
 Perhaps this is the reason that the movement born in the state of Uttarakhand has once again started to turn
 pradesh kii janata bholibhali jarur he, magar apane shashakt nirnay ko lekar puure bharat varsh main pahchaan rakhti he
 The Trivendra government will have to think, understand that before the spark turns into a fire, it will have to form a correct opinion about the people of its own state
 agar aisa na hua to 17 saalon se dabe is andolan kii aag kahi unki hi sarkaar ko jhulasa na de
 Legislators, ministers and chief ministers themselves who have said big things on migration have migrated from their respective areas
 badi-badi kothiyon ke saath apana ashiana dehradun main bana chuke ye sabhi mananeey phir chaahe wo congress ke hon yaa phir bhaajapa ke, sabhi devbhumi kii janata ko chhalane kaa kaam hi kar rahe hai
 Medical and education: On the demand of the people of Khashala Pradesh, there is treatment, water for children to get proper education, drinking and food grains
 isi makasad ko puraa karne ke liye garasain ko uttarakhand ko rajdhani banane kii maang ho rahi he
 If there will be a capital in the middle of the state, then the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who gave the slogan of development, will also be fulfilled, otherwise the talk of development will be dishonest in this state

 sapa kii sarkaar banane ke baad upi main shuru huin mahatvakankshi yojanaayen ab soobe ke khajaane par bhaar banati ja rahi hai
 In order to strike a balance between budget constraints and the political objectives associated with it, the government is forced to change its policies
 dasvin paas karne vaali saamaanya varg kii chaatraon ko aage kii padhai ke prati prerit karne ke liye 'padhe betiyaan-bade betiyaan' yojana band kii ja chuki he
 At the same time, now the government has focused on two other schemes related to girl students 'kanya Vidyadhan' and 'our daughter, her tomorrow'
 haalanki, sarkari khajaane kii mali haalat ko dekhte hue in yojanaon kii dhanrashi main das-das hajaar kii katautee kii gai he, lekin sarkaar kii daleel yah he ki zyada se zyada chaatraon ko laabh pahunchane ke uddeshy se yah badlaav kiya gaya he
 In fact, apart from the lack of budget, the government is also worried about the upcoming general election
 dhanrashi main katautee se donon yojanaon main labhaarthiyon kii sankhya badhaakar sarkaar ne apane siyaasi abhiyaan ko bhi aage badhaane kaa formula tay kiya gaya he
 The government was giving a grant of Rs

 If you go to the room of Rajendra Yadav in Daryaganj office of literary magazine Hans, you will see his chair lying empty
 unke nidhan ko kareeb dedh saal ho chukaa he
 No one still sits in his chair in the office
 iske thik upar diwaar par unki tasviir tangi hui he
 But the uninterrupted journey of Hans, who has become synonymous with him, has not stopped
 isi daftar main patrika ke may, 2015 ke ank ke liye ek shubhachintak kaa patr aayaa, “rajendra ji ke jane ke baad man hi mar gaya tha
 Socha, as prestigious magazines like Sarika and Dharmyug are closed, so will the swan
 par jab hans ke haalia ank padhe to santosh hua vah vaise hi nikal rahi he
 Rajendraji, who had become hundreds of new writers, how would he let him die
 ”jahiraa taur par rajendra yadav ke dehanth ke baad unki beti rachana yadav ne patrika kaa prabandhan sambhaal liya or sampadan kaa kaam sanjay sahay dekh rahe hai
 Sahai says, "there was a fear that after Rajendra ji, there would not be a sudden financial crisis in front of Hans
 lekin rachana sab kuch peshewar tareeke se manage kar rahi hai
 "actually Hans may not have the same sharpness and reputation as Rajendra Yadav but his journey continues unabated
 duusari ore, hindi ke saahitiyik galiyare main pratishthit patrika pahal ke sampadak gyanaranjan june ke 100wein ank ko uski pratishtha ke anuroop prabhavi rup de chuke hai
 So in August 2015, the 150th issue of Naya Gyanodaya is going to come, which has been made by its editor Leeladhar Mandloi ji-jan in making it special
 apane samay ke saath muthbheddarasal, hans main kisi bhi rachanaakaar kaa chapana bade hi fakhr kii baat hua karti thi or yah aasaan bhi nahin tha
 Now the magazine has done a new experiment
 isane ghuspaithiye sheershak se ek nayaa kollam shuru kiya he, jisamen jhuggi-jhonpadipoon main rahane vaale yuvaaon kii kahaniyon ko tarjeeh di ja rahi he
 The story of a rickshaw puller has got a place in it
 jaahir he, hindi ke saahitiyik halake main pehle aisa koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 Similarly, in its April 2015 issue, Pakhi has published an interview of popular writer Surendra Mohan Pathak, who till yesterday has been dismissed by the Hindi literary fraternity as a pulp litterateur
 isi ank main lokapriy sahitya or gambhir sahitya par sahityakaron kaa vimarsh natthi he
 Clearly, these small magazines are not only doing new experiments but are also oriented towards new discourses in which the pulse of the present time is explored
 isi kadi main vagarth ne aktubar, 2014 se farvari, 2015 tak ke paanch ankon main pichley pachaas saal kii kavita par vimarsh chalaaya, jo charchit rahaa
 In this, Hindi poetry from the death of Muktibodh till now i
e
 1964 to 2014, examines how the poems were during this time and the values that Muktibodh gave place, are they getting the tone? Similarly in the recent issue of Hans and Pahal, Carmendu Shishir discusses Urdu and Muslim Renaissance in detail
 yah paksh abhi tak upekshit rahaa he
 These journals also include discussions on contemporary topics other than literature
 masalan, pahal ke janvari, 2015 ank main jitendra bhaatia jahaan ikkisvin sadi kii ladaaiyaan sheershak se kisaanon kii durdasha, unki aatmahatya se lekar jiem fasal tak kii padtaal karte hai to nayaa gyanoday main global varming or aapadaa, naitikta or sarokaar jaise muddon par kendrit vimarsh kai sawaal uthaata he
 Another feature of the mentioned magazines is that foreign literature is prominently in them
 masalan, kathadesh kaa march, 2015 ank jahaan afro-american stri-lekhan par kendrit he to nayaa gyanoday ke may, 2015 ank kaa focus afghanistan, pakistan se lekar myanmar tathaa maldive jaise paas-pados ke deshon kii kahaniyon-kavitaaon par he
 Similarly, the March 2015 issue of the initiative published five poems by the famous American poet and essayist David Masson
 pahal main french or german se lekar bangla, punjabi tathaa marathi samet anya bhartiya bhashaaon kii shreshth rachanaaen chhapati rahi hai
 Another achievement has been added to its name that Teubinje University of Germany has digitized this magazine and all its 99 issues have been translated into German
 bahujan ubharudhar, stri vimarsh par kendrit patrika strikal ke sampadak sanjeev chandan ek or ubhaar kii ore dhyaan dilaate hai, “saahitiyik patrikaon main dalit-adivasee-pichde samudaay ke lekhan kaa dayera badha he
 "some magazines are mainly focused on these
 udaahranarth forward press ne bahujan sahitya varshiki ank nikaala or obisi sahitya sambandhi vimarsh se lekar aalochana kaa bahujan drushtikon bhi pesh kiya he
 It has established Bahujan-centered cultural discourse and has given place to the voice of these communities
 isi tarah jeenyu main professor ganga sahay meena ne hindi sahitya main adivaasiyon kii anupasthiti kii baat kehete hue adivasee sahitya patrika kii shuruyaat kii he
 Creating with cooperation, but the biggest crisis facing these magazines is economic
 nayaa gyanoday, vagarth or paakhi jaisi patrikaon ko chhod kamobesh sabhi patrikaayen saamudayik sahyog se chalati hai
 Wagarth takes out the Indian Language Trust, the new Gyanodaya gets the Indian Jnanpith and Pakhi the Independent Media Initiative Society
 kai patrikaon ke sampadakon ne bataaya ki ve aarthik sankat se do-chaar hai
 Sankar, editor of Parikatha, explains, "the government is not serious about literary magazines
 dilli sarkaar ne srijan-samaran naam se kai patrikaon ko 30,000 ru
 Started the process of advertising
 ab vah bhi band he
 "sanjay Sahay points to the policy of the new government at the Center," if you write anti-incumbency, it reacts
 doordarshan kaa vigyaapan hamen miltaa tha jise pichley saal band kar diya gaya he
 "at the same time, Gyanranjan says," We do not take advertisements of any political party or its government
 doston-mitron ke sahyog se hi pahal kaa safar jari he
 "it is worth mentioning that due to Gyanranjan's health-related problems and economic challenges, the journey of the initiative was stopped about three years ago
 to strikal jaisi patrika inhen vajahon se aniyamit or kareeb-kareeb band rahi or ab website par dhyaan laga chuki he
 In such a situation, will these magazines save their tradition and credibility and become more professional? Mandloi suggests, "literary magazines need the support of government advertisements
 saath hi inhen apana marketing tantra viksit kar or peshewar hone kii jarurat he
 " kehete hai maa ke chehre main bhagwaan dikhataa he or agar aapane maa kii seva kar lee to aapako bhagwaan kii puja karne kii jarurat nahin hoti
 Something similar mother also feels by looking at her child's face
 baccha kamjor ho yaa tandoorust maa kaa pyaar kabhi bhi apane bachche ke liye kam nahin hota
 You must have seen special children many times and once in your mind, you must have thought about their mother with a sense of compassion that this child cannot give them any happiness
 par kya aap jaanate hai kima kaa vishwaas or pyaar har bachche ke liye ek sa hi hota hekhyonki uskaa baccha us maa ke liye bhagwaan kaa diya tohfa hota he
 What no human in the world can understand, the mother's mind understands without saying
 is video main dekhie kuch aisi hi maanon kaa anmol pyaar or unki khuli ankhon ke sapane apane bacchon ke liye
 That is why only one who does not care about his happiness and sorrow is called mother
 unke samarpan or pyaar ko hamaara sat sat naman

 " "in dinon tivi par serial 'utaran' kii charchaa he, to bollywood main log shahrukh khan ke 'utaran' ke kisse suna rahe hai
 It is being heard that Farah's film "teesmar Khan" was not done by Shahrukh Khan, now that film has come in Akshay Kumar's bag
 ab farah khan or shahrukh khan ke bich lambey samay tak itani baatcheet shaayad na ho paae, isliye ki farah khan apni nai film 'tismar khan' ke nirdesan me jutane vaali hai
 This will be the first time that light, camera and action will be echoed by Farah's mouth and Akshay Kumar will start the action instead of Shahrukh
 ji haa, tismar khan hai akshay kumaar
 Farah Khan, who always called Shahrukh 'main Hoon Na', now said 'I am not'
 apane pati shiris kundar ke saath farah ne shahrukh khan ke mukaable main akshay kumaar ko sin kiya he
 Akshay is very happy to get this opportunity
 akshay kumaar ne kaha, 'haa, main farah kii film tismar khan kar rahaa hum
 i have a long standing relationship with Farah and her husband Shirish Kunder
 maine shiris kii pehali film jaaneman kii thi or farah ke bhai sajid khan ke saath do filmein kar chukaa hum
 i do not know if this film was written for Shabarukh, only Farah would know
 'yahi nahin farah ne aage badhkar shahrukh ke sabase bade dushman salmaan kii garlfriend katrina caff ko bhi apni film kii lead heroin banaaya he
 In this way Farah's husband Shirish has announced to close the chapter with Shahrukh
 ab sawaal yah he ki shahrukh or farah ke camp main akshay or katrina ne send kaise lagaai, to industry ke logon kaa maananaa he ki ye daraar paidaa kii he farah ke pati shiris ne
 Shirish's tantrums are that Shah Rukh Khan does not like her much and does not want to do films with her, while Farah Khan admits that she is incomplete without Shahrukh's friendship
 shahrukh unke liye behad ahm hai
 Shahrukh Khan's involvement in every business of Farah was considered obligatory
 jab se farah khan ko industry main shahrukh kaa saath mila, unki safalataa or pahchaan main chaar chand lag gayi
 The journey started with 'chaiya Chaiya' from the film 'dil Se' has been a steady blast till 'om Shanti Om', but now that Farah has chosen Shah Rukh as Akshay Kumar as Teesamar Khan, this is so It has been decided that no matter how deep the friendship is in this industry, it does not last long

 The High Court has said that not every case of bonding with the promise of marriage is rape, the court has also said that sex in India, especially in big cities, prior to ab-shaadi is not surprising

 Rahul Patil was accused of rape by his former girlfriend Seema Deshmukh promising marriage
 seemaa ne daawa kiya tha kisambandhbanane ke baad vah pregnent ho gai thi lekin vaada karne ke baavjood rahul ne kisi or ladki se shaadi kar lee
 On the other hand, the accused in this case, Rahul, in his clarification said that their relationship was made with mutual consent but marriage could not happen due to their caste separation
 gauratlab he ki rahul or seemaa donon peshey se vakil hai
 According to the news published in an English newspaper, the two had been with each other since 1999 and they had a physical relationship in 2006
 seemaa ne daawa kiya ki rahul ne pehle usase shaadi kaa vaada kiya tha lekin 2009 main usne shaadi se inkaar kar diya
 According to Seema, he also attempted suicide after this
 haalanki iske baad bhi donon ke bich shaareerik sambandh kaayam hote rahe
 Hearing the matter, Justice Mridula Bhatkar of the Bombay High Court said, "nowadays, in a relationship or before marriage, a physical relationship is not as big as it used to be
 khaskar mumbai or pune jaise metro shaharon main to yah or bhi aam he
 Justice Bhatkar further said, though openness has not yet come in our society like western countries
 hamaare yahaan ab bhi shaadi se pehle yuvaaon ke sex sambandhon ko thik najar se nahin dekha jaataa
 But the court cannot remain unaware of the changes coming in society and youth relations

 com / ilkosry1da mumbai ke dharavi ilaake main buudhvaar ko saat varshiya ek maasoom kii dardanaak halaat main maut ho gai
 The accident occurred due to the collapse of a full cylinder of LPG on the child's head
 police ne delivery main ke khilaaf laaparvaahee baratane kaa maamla darj kiya he
 According to the police, the LPG delivery-man reached there at the same time as the child was sleeping near the child
 slam ilaaka hone kii vajah se yahaan choti jagah par hi rahane ke liye 'van plus van' chaal bani hui hai
 The delivery man was first going to put the cylinder on the floor when the cylinder slipped from his hand and fell down on the head of the innocent
 jisase bachche kii maukey par himautaho gai
 The child has been identified as Mohammed Bilal Sheikh, who studied in the first grade
 buudhvaar ko baccha ghar par hi tha
 The child went to sleep near the door due to high afternoon temperatures in summer
 uskaa sir daravaaje se baahar tha
 At the same time 25-year-old delivery man Magha Krishnan Nadar arrived there
 wo pehle maale par silendar kii delivery ke liye seedhi chadh rahaa tha ki tabhi uske haath se silendar phisal kar neeche so rahe bilal ke sir par ja gira
 Bilal died instantly due to bruised head
 pados main rahane vaale ek chashmadid ne bataaya, 'garmi se bachane ke liye dopaher ko log aksar is tarah so jate hai
 The cylinder fell directly onto the child's head
 ye bahut hi dardanaak haadasa tha
 Bilal's father and delivery man ran to Sion Hospital immediately with him but by then it was too late
 police ne delivery main naadar ke khilaaf laaparvaahee kaa cese darj kiya he

 Priya Dutt first said on recognition that she is not the daughter-in-law of Sunil Dutt and Nargis Dutt's family
 vah sanjay dutt kii bivi nahin he
 He only pretended to my brother to fulfill his political and film desires
 hindi filmon ke mashhoor abhinayta or purv congressi netaa swargeey sunil dutt kii beti priya dutt ne kaha ki main is baat se khush hum ki mere pita aaj kii sthiti dekhne ke liye jinda nahin hai
 MP Priya Dutt said that she was surprised at the announcement of Sanjay Dutt contesting from the Samajwadi Party
 sanjay dutt ne puure parivaar se koi salaah nahin lee
 In an interview to a newspaper, Priya Dutt, the daughter of late Hindi film actor and former Congress leader late Sunil Dutt, said that Sanjay Dutt's wife's recognition has damaged the Dutt family's image
 priya ne kaha ki agar sanju chunaav ladanaa chaahate the to unhen sahi samay par congress se tikat mil saktaa tha
 Our father has never associated with the Samajwadi Party till date
 abhi to faisle kii syaahi sookhne bhi na pai thi ki sanjay dutt ko maaf kiye jane kii guhaar maharashtra ke rajyapal ke darbar main laga di, kisi or ne nahin balki supreme court ke hi ek purv mananeey nyaayadhish ne
 Justice M
 en
 Katju has made interesting arguments in favor of his plea
 ek to yahi ki sanjay dutt ko 1993 ke bam dhamaakon kaa doshi nahin paaya gaya or aatankwaadi nahin mana gaya
 He was held guilty of possessing unlicensed restricted weapons
 duusare, yah ghatana 20 saal pehle hui thi, tabase usne bahut apmaan or utaar-chadhaav dekha he
 Thirdly, he has spent 18 months in jail
 chauthaa tark, ve shaadishuda or do chote bacchon ke pita hai
 Fifth, his parents worked for the good of society and the nation
 chatha tark, unhone apni film ke jariye mahatma gandhi kii smriti or unke sandesh ko taaja kiya he
 The question is, if Katju's appeal is accepted, will any of these arguments alone or collectively stand the test of justice? It is apprehensive, because a Union Minister, a lawyer by profession, has said that his opinion has weight and should be respected
 maharashtra main congress sarkaar, filmajagat ke dabaav main nishchay hi supreme court ke ek purv nyaayadhish kii raay ko ek majboot kanoonee aadhaar maanakar rajyapal se maafee kii sifarish kar sakati he
 However, Sanjay Dutt has clearly stated in a press conference that he will not apologize
 hamen yahaan samvidhan or kanoon kii sahi sthiti ko samaj lenaa chahie, jo 60 ke dashak main nanavati kshamaadaan ke samay itani spasht na thi
 However, today it is being presented as a valuable example
 supreme court ke anusaar, kshamaadaan kaa adhikaar hamaari sanvaidhanik prakriya kaa ang he, adhikarprapt peeth kii ore se dayaa kaa koi nijee krity nahin
 It cannot be used at will or in an uncontrolled way
 adaalat ne saaf kaha he ki kshamaadaan kaa adhikaar apane aap main kanoon nahin ho saktaa, balki sanvaidhanik tantra kii baarikiyon se sanchalit hona chahie
 So the pardon given in this case can be challenged with five arguments
 ek, yah dimag lagaae bina diya gaya he
 Two, the motive behind the order is not right
 teen, yah puri tarah se aprancegik tarkon ke aadhaar par he
 Four, associated content is excluded from consideration
 paanch, yah aadesh manamaana he
 Most of us took some time to understand the facts of Sanjay Dutt's case and also had to do some investigation
 hamane agle din ke akhabaaron kaa intjaar kiya
 But those who demanded an immediate apology probably remembered these facts
 dutt ne hathiyaaron kii khep aane kaa intjaar kiya, chupchaap hathiyaaron ko apane ahaate main laane main madad kii
 He was in contact with Anees Ibrahim who is Dawood Ibrahim's brother and one of the main conspirators
 unhone hathiyaar nasht karne ke liye bhi bheje
 So is he just guilty of technical crime? Obviously not
 aparaadh kaa doshi har vyakti lambii yatnapurna nyaayik prakriya kaa shikaar hota he
 Every convict who appeals for clemency spends a lot of time in jail
 sanjay dutt kii patni or chote bachche hai, to ye to duusare tamaam mujarimon ke bhi hote hai
 Many parents may not be famous, there will be people who have also served their community
 bahuton main kalakaar kii pratibha bhi hogi
 If i had been a lawyer for the state government and had tried to justify the pardon on the basis of any of these arguments, i would have been very humbly advised to close my file and concentrate on another case
 nanavati kshamaadaan kaa nirnay ek alag daur main hua tha or vaise bhi is maamle ke tathy to ekadam alag hai
 Then there was no destruction, there was no shadow of terror on the society or the country
 vah to patni ke premi kii hatya kaa maamla tha or commander nanavati ne puure ghatnakram main bahut shaleen aacharan kiya tha
 He had asked Prem Ahuja if he would take responsibility and marry his wife? He laughed at his mouth before he died
 use maarane ke baad commander nanavati khud chalakar police ke saamne hajir hue the
 After receiving a pardon from the governor, Kavus Nanavati, his wife Sylvia and three children left India and moved to Canada and never returned
 agar sanjay dutt ko maafee mil gai to ve phir filmon se kamai main jute jaaenge
 But the remaining accused will continue to rot in the jail
 sanjay dutt ke haq main fouran apil karne ke kai din baad justise katju ko ilham hua or jabunnisa kaaji yaad aa gai
 It took time for Katju to think and understand his recommendation, but it seemed appropriate to do the Dutt's recommendation quickly
 ab jab abhiyukt ne khud kshamaadaan kaa vikalp chhod diya he to sanvaidhanik auchity yahi he ki rajya or centre sarkarein tisare pakshon kii tamaam apilen kachra peti ke hawaale kar den
 Lawmakers have a keen eye on those who suffer needlessly

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday targeted the BJP state president Dilip Ghosh
 unhone bijepi par ugravadi sanghathan kii tarah kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Mamta Banerjee said, 'leaders of some political parties are speaking the words of militants, some are talking about encounters, some are saying they will shoot people, make bombs, commit murders
 'mamata banerjee ne tiemasi kii vistrut kor cameti kii baithak main ye pratikriya dilip ghosh ke us bhaashan par di jo unhone jalpaigudi main diya tha
 Ghosh had threatened an encounter with TMC leaders citing increasing attacks on BJP workers
 mamata banerjee ne bijepi par kisi ugravadi sanghathan kii tarah kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 According to Mamta, since the BJP has come to the center, it is trying to show muscle power
 mamata ne kaha, 'main unhen nyotaa detii hum ki ve yahaan aakar raajnneetik vaastaviktaa ko dekhen
 Did they not see what happened in the panchayat elections? Because you are ruling in Delhi, you can speak in the language of gun and bomb

 'bataa den kipaschim bengalapulice ne bijepi pradesh adhyaksh dilip ghosh ke khilaaf jalpaigudi main mangalvaar ko bhadakaau bhaashan dene ke aarope main exiaar darj karai he
 Ghosh told the BJP workers that if they are attacked by TMC, they should also retaliate with equal force
 ghosh ne kaha, 'hamaare sabar kii bhi koi seemaa he
 
 
 We have not written any bond that we will feed free rasgulla to those who attack us
 
 
 unhen bam ke badale bam se jawaab diya jayega, goli ke badale goli or har lathi ke badale lathi
 
 
 Leading a 'law violation program' in the district, Ghosh told party workers, 'tmc's grandfather who is committing hooliganism here, i tell him, the day is not far when you will either go to jail or straight encounter
 Will be killed in 'pulicene ghosh ke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 143 / 186 / 188 / 506 ke tahat cese darj kiya he
 Mamata's statement came after another Bengal BJP leader Sayatan Basu repeated Dilip Ghosh's remarks
 birbhum main party kaaryakartaaon se baat karte hue basu ne kaha, "mere pradesh adhyaksh ne muthbhedon kii baat kii he

 Umang Singhar, the state's forest minister, has complained to Sonia Gandhi accusing senior leader of her own party Digvijay Singh of destabilizing the Kamal Nath government
 van mantri umang singhar ne sonia gandhi ko likhe patr main aarope lagaaya he ki digvijay singh apni hi sarkaar ko asthir karne kii sajeesh kar rahe hai or pradesh main ek vaikalpik satta centre banane kii firaaq main hai
 Singhar has confirmed to 'india Today' that he has written a letter to Sonia Gandhi
 haalanki unhone patr kaa sandarbh nahin bataaya ki uskaa labboluab kya he
 Digvijay became the center of power, however, 'india Today' has received information about the letter in which Singhar writes, 'I am bringing it to your notice with great sadness that Digvijay Singh is trying to establish himself as an alternative power center
 While trying to destabilize the Kamal Nath-led government
 ve lagaataar mukhyamantri or unke cabinet sahyogiyon ko patr likh rahe hai or unhen soshal media par jari kar rahe hai
 By doing so, they are providing ammunition to the opposition BJP to attack the government
 'singhar patr main aage likhte hai, 'shuukravaar 30 agast ko digvijay singh ne madhya pradesh sarkaar ke sabhi mantriyon ko ek aisa hi patr likhakar unki ore se kiye gaye tabadalon or posting kii siforeeshon par karrwai ke bare main spashtikaran maanga
 He also released the letter on social media
 iske baad vipakshi bijepi ne is avasar ko lapak liya or sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki digvijay singh parde ke peeche se sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 'how did Forest Minister Umang Singhar respond to Digvijay Singh's letter demanding investigation into the scams? On this question of journalists, Shinger said, 'everyone in the state knows about it
 sarkaar or vipaksh main bhi har vyakti yah jaanata he ki digvijay singh parde ke peeche se sarkaar chalaa rahe hai, tab unhen patr likhane kii kya jarurat he
 'singhar has also alleged in the letter to Sonia Gandhi that cases like Digvijay Singh Vyapam Scam, Tender Scam and Plantation Scam are booming and demanding an inquiry from Chief Minister Kamal Nath but they are Simhastha or Ujjain Kumbh Mela Scam Let's not talk a lot
 singhar ne kaha, 'sinhasth ghotaalaa unke bete jayavardhan singh ke shahari prashasan vibhaag kii dein he
 Jayawardhan Singh said in response to a question asked in the assembly that there was no scam in Ujjain Kumbh, while the Congress, which was in opposition then, made it a big issue
 'madhya pradesh main digvijay kheme or kamalnath kheme ke bich manmutav jaahir he lekin haal ke dinon main isamen kaaphi teji dekhi ja rahi he

 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Axis My India exit poll proved an accurate estimation of seats in all the states as to why India Today Group leads the election coverage
 or kyon matganana vaale din desh bhar main logon ne sabase adhik bharosa @indiatoday or @aajtak par dikhaaya
 This survey process was particularly difficult and complex in West Bengal
 is rajya main log desh ke anya hisson kii tulana main alag tareeke se pratikriya dete hai
 Even the results from this state were seen differently from other parts of the country
 jahaan har taraf modi kii aandhi chal rahi thi or virdohi dalon ko karaari maat khaani padi
 At the same time, despite the tremendous rise in the vote share of BJP in West Bengal, Mamta Banerjee's party TMC retained its land to some extent
 haalanki, tiemasi ko saal 2014 loksabhaa chunaav kii tulana main 12 siton ko khona padaa
 since the state came to power in 2009 
 pashchim bengal main vot share kii baat kii jaae to tiemasi kaa vot share 40% se badhkar 43% tak pahunchaa
 The BJP garnered 40% votes this time as compared to the 16% vote share of the last election, as was estimated in the Axis My India survey
 bijepi ne is loksabhaa chunaav main sabhi ko chaunkaate hue 18 loksabhaa seat hasil kin
 The Congress had to satisfy itself with two Lok Sabha seats in this election with 6% vote share in the state
 congress kii maujuudagi ab malda or murshidaabad jaise apane gadhon tak hi simit rah gai he
 Its vote share, which was once considered an impregnable fort of the Left, has shrunk to 6%
 haalanki left kaa vot share congress jitna he lekin uske haath ek bhi loksabhaa seat nahin lagi, isliye uskaa nuksaan congress se kahin bada he
 Data from Axis My India showed that this time there were some important factors behind the change in West Bengal
 voting pattern bhi aayu varg ke mutabik badla
 When it comes to the age group of 18-25, 42% of the voters of this category voted for BJP
 yuva votaron se tiemasi ko bijepi se 1% kam yani 41% vot mili
 If we talk about 26-35 age group then BJP and TMC got 42-42% votes from this category
 36-50 aayu varg main se 43% votaron ne tiemasi ko or 41% ne bijepi ko vot die
 However, majority of the voters above the age of 50 i

 45% voted in favor of TMC
 vahiin is varg se 37% votaron ne bijepi ko vot diya
 Professional degree holders have given full support to BJP
 is varg se 53% votaron ne bijepi ko vot diya
 Only 33% of the voters from this category voted for TMC
 shaikshanik str kii baat kii jaae to niraksharon se lekar post graduate tak ke virgon main bijepi ko 35% se 40% tak vot mili
 On the other hand, TMC getting more than 40% votes in every category is a proof of its popularity
 vahiin left or congress kisi bhi varg main vot share main dahaai ke aankade ko bhi paar nahin kar sake
 Talking of women voters, 44% voted in favor of TMC
 purush votaron main 42% ne tiemasi ko vot diya
 The BJP received 40–40% of the votes from female and male voters
 shahari votaron ne bijepi ko tiemasi kii tulana main vot dena kahin adhik pasand kiya
 Among urban voters, 46% voted for BJP and 39% voted for TMC
 gramin kshetron main ye trend ulataa dekhne ko mila

 Have you ever seen a woman in an important position in the RSS
 agar aap mahatma gandhi kii tasviir dekhte hai to unke daaen or bain ore mahilaayein dikhti hai
 But on the other hand Mohan Bhagwat is either alone or surrounded by men
 One of the most important thing to be done in the Congress is to balance the number of men we put to fight election & the number of women

 There are a total of 27 districts in Chhattisgarh
 rajya main kul 51 siten saamaanya, 10 siten essi or 29 siten asti ke liye arakshit hai
 What were the results in the 2013 election
 
 
 2013 main vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 8 disambar ko ghoshit kiye gaye the
 Among them, the Bharatiya Janata Party formed the government by defeating the Congress for the third consecutive time in the state

 While the Congress was able to win only 39 seats
 jabaki 2 siten anya ke naam gai thim
 Despite the BJP getting three seats less than in 2008, they formed their government with an absolute majority
 raman singh 2003 se rajya ke mukhyamantri hai
 Opponents who are spoiling the game by telling Surjewala as outsiders have not been able to spend time in Delhi politics
 One candidate is on a bike and the other candidate is being weighed with laddus
 kuch is tarah kii tasviir aapkokaithalaki vidhansabha main najar aa jaaengi
 With the slogan of 'kaithal bolti bhi aur tolati bhi hai', veteran Congress leader Randeep Surjewala is weighing himself in the scales
 darasal, congress ke media prabharee hone ke naate dilli main unki tuuti bolti he
 He left no stone unturned in attacking the BJP government, but today his challenge is completely opposite
 aaj chunauti he khud ko rashtriya netaa nahin balki sthaneey netaa sabit karne kii
 On the other hand, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Lilaram Surjewala is trying to spoil his game by calling him an outsider
 unhone 'bahari bhagaao apana banaao' kaa naaraa diya he
 Actually Nirvanaranandeep Surjewali is a traditional seat but for the last two times Randeep has been winning the assembly elections from Kaithal
 jind ke chunavi ran main randeep ke tarkash se nikle hue tir unako ulte pad gaye the
 Randeep had then talked about leaving Kaithal's seat after winning the Jind election, now his opponents are also making it an issue
 hakeekat yah bhi he ki 2014 se 2019 tak randeep ne dilli kii raajnneeti main vyast hone ke chalate pradesh kii siyasat ko kam tavajjo di magar ginane ke liye unke paas kaithal ke vikaas ke kaam bhi hai
 His supporters feel that his clean image and hard work are his biggest strengths
 vahi 2000 main ieneldi se vidhayak rahe leelaram apane saadhaaran parivaar kaa hawala dete hai
 Their penetration in the community is very strong
 agar muqabla jat banaam gaiyr jat hota he, to bhaajapa ko sidhaa phayda ho saktaa he
 It remains to be seen whether Randeep Surjewala, the troubleshooter who kept the Congress Party out of trouble, will be able to score a hat-trick of victory from Kaithal or not
 agar aap bhi hotel, restaurant yaa ghar main zeus pite hai to jaraa saavdhaan ho jaaie

 Watch full video- civil socity ke sadasyon ne sarkaar ke saath baatcheet ke baad ramlila maindaan main aakar baatcheet kaa byora diya
 Arvind Kejriwal told the people that the three issues that have not been agreed upon are: 1
 sarkari lokapal bill main keval senior offisron ke bhrashtachar kii baatcheet kii gai he
 While the common man has to deal with junior officers, the government is not ready to bring in the demand of bringing junior officers in the realm
 2
 In all the states, the government said on the matter of the Lokayukta and will tell it thoughtfully
 3
 Not every department agreed to the time limit (citizen Charter) and person to do the work of the people
 (udhaaharan ke taur par rashan card banane kii samaysima kaa tay hona)
 Know who is Anna Hazare Apart from this, Arvind Kejriwal said that on bringing the judges under the purview of Lokpal, the government said that the judges will be brought under the ambit of another law
 anna kii team ne isapar kaha ki sarkaar donon kanoon ko saath-saath sansad main laaye or uske pehle uskaa masauda civil socity ko dikhaanaa hoga
 The government has agreed to this
 jaane kya he jan lokapal?civil socity kii sadsy kiran bedi ne bataaya ki sarkaar sibiai ke anti karpshan vibhaag ko lokapal ke daayre main laane par sahamat ho gai he
 That is, the CBI will not investigate corruption further, only the Lokpal will do
 civil socity ke tisare sadsy prashanth bhushan ne logon ke bataaya ki pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke daayre main laane par sarkaar ko aapatti nahin he
 Apart from special coverage on Anna's movement, the behavior of mps should also come under the purview of Lokpal
 There has also been some agreement on this issue
 saansad ko lokapal main laane ke sawaal par sarkaar ne samvidhan kii dhara 105 kaa hawala diya jiske tahat sansadon ko sansad main bolne par khuli chhot hogi
 On this, the members of civil society said that the exemption to speak is correct but there is no reference to the exemption of taking bribe to speak
 ajtak LIVE TV dekhne ke liye yahaan clic karensarkaar samvidhan kii dhara 105 main kuch prastaav jodne par sahamat ho gai he jisase ki saansadon kaa bartaav bhi lokapal ke daayre main aaye
 Meanwhile, Finance Minister Pranab has also appealed to Anna Hazare to break his fast late in the night
 ek nai research ke mutabik pataa chalaa he ki duniyabar main khudakushi karne vaale 20 fisadi log berogari kii vajah se hi aatmahatya kaa kadam uthaate hai
 The number of people committing suicide under the stress of increasing unemployment is becoming a cause of concern worldwide
 is research ke liye in deshon ko chaar hisson main baanta gaya
 North and South America, North and Western Europe, South and Eastern Europe and non-america and non-europe
 jisamen bharat or china se aankade uplabdh nahin hai
 Carlos Norte, lead author at the University of Zurich, said that we have found a deep connection between unemployment and suicide in all four areas
 aakhir main yah baat saamne ai ki berogari dar main badlaav ling or aayu samoohon ko samaan rup se prabhavit karata he
 Nort told that the year 2008 was a crisis year, in which the number of suicides was increased by five thousand in a short period
 darasal us saal takreeban 46 hajaar logon kii khudakushi kii vajah berogari se hi judi thi
 Norte said the number of people committing suicide due to unemployment is nine times more than the number of people who committed suicide due to the recent economic downturn

 rajya sabha ke liye 58 nae sadasyon or ek seat ke liye upachunaav kii prakriya desh ke 16 rajyon main puri ho gai he
 In these 58 seats, elections for 25 seats were held in 6 states while 33 members from 10 states are reaching Rajya Sabha without any protest
 antim nateezon ke mutabik bijepi rajya sabha main sabase badi party ban gai he
 How will the politics of the country sit with the final results of the election, will the BJP dominate the Rajya Sabha like the Lok Sabha? If not, what will be the impact of the current state of the Rajya Sabha on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections? Let us know what will be its effect on BJP politics in the coming days
 rajya sabha ke in chunavonmen bijepi ne 29 siten jiti he, congress ko 9 siten mili hai, tiemasi ko 4 siten, jabaki tiares-bijedy ke hisse 3 siten ai hai
 TDP and RJD got 2-2 seats and Samajwadi Party, Shiv Sena, NCP and YSR Congress got one each
 sadan kii badali ankaganit main bijepi ko 10 saansadon kii sankhya kaa bada phayda hua he, is phaayde se bijepi maujuuda 58 sadasyon ke aankade se badhkar 68 tak pahunch gai he
 The NDA figure is 86, including its peers
 haalanki yah aankada rajyasabha main bahumat ke liye jaruri 123 siton se kaaphi neeche he
 Significantly, after the current elections, the Congress has not suffered much, it has 54 seats
 rajya sabha main congress ke paas pehle bhi upree sadan main 54 saansad the
 Including Congress's allies, the UPA figure reaches 68
 lihaaja, is sthiti main ek baat saaf he ki maujuuda loksabhaa ke kaarykaal main bijepi ke paas bahumat nahin he
 For this, once again he will have to lead in the assembly elections in 2018 and 2019, with a strong majority in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 aisi sthiti main bijepi ke liye 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle apane agenda hindutv kaa saath pakadana aasaan nahin hoga
 The BJP promised to raise its Hindutva agenda along with the development agenda in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 chunaav nateezon ke baad jab kendra main majboot modi sarkaar kaa gathan hua to party ne achche din laane ke liye tej vikaas kii nitiyon ko aage badhaayaa
 Now, with just one year left in the 2019 general election, fast growth is missing from the economic data and the bjp's good days are raising the same questions that were faced by Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Shining India
 aisi sthiti main bijepi ke paas waapas hindutv ke agenda par jane kaa vikalp tha, lekin rajya sabha main abhi tak bahumat na milane ke chalate agle ek saal tak modi sarkaar ko apane hindutv agenda par jane kaa bhi mauka nahin mil paaegaa
 Significantly, the BJP has talked about the Hindutva agenda for the past several decades
 is agenda ke liye beete 4 saal ke dauraan modi sarkaar ne uniform civil code, dhara 370 ko hataane or loksabhaa ke saath-saath deshbhar main vidhansabha chunaavon ko karaane masauda taiyaar kiya he
 But to move ahead on all these drafts, the constitution needs to be amended for which it is necessary that the BJP gets a special majority in the Lok Sabha as well as the Rajya Sabha
 hindutv agenda par khara utarane ke liye yah bhi jaruri he ki bijepi kii kam se kam 15 rajyon main bhi vishesh bahumat vaali sarkaar maujuud rahe
 However, BJP currently has a coalition government in 15 states along with the Chief Minister as well as in 21 states
 lekin rajya sabha main bahumat kii sambhaavna 2019 ke chunaavon ke baad banane kii sthiti main is aankade main bhi pherbadal dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 It is worth noting that while assembly elections in Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand and Maharashtra will be held soon after the 2019 general elections, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, Sikkim and Telangana will be held along with the Lok Sabha elections
 iske alaava 2019 loksabhaa chunaavon se thik pehle 2018 main chhattigarh, karnataka, madhyapradesh, mizoram or rajasthan ke vidhansabha chunaav karaayenge
 After these elections, if the BJP has a two-thirds majority government in 15 states along with a special majority in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha at the Center, then an effective decision can be taken on the Hindutva agenda for the Modi government
 jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav ke tisare charan main guuruuvaar ko 17 siton par matdaan hoga
 The Election Commission has completed all preparations to conduct elections in these seats in a peaceful, fair and transparent manner and nearly forty thousand election personnel have been deployed
 mukhya nirvachan adhikari vinay kumaar choube ne aaj yahaan samvaadadaata sammelan main bataaya ki in 17 siton ke liye kul 7016 matdaan centre banaae gaye hai, jinamein kul 56,18,267 matadaata apane matadhikaar kaa istemaal kar sakenge

 There are 277 male and 32 female candidates among them
 jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav ke duusare charan main shanivaar ko bees siton ke liye 64

 39 percent voting was recorded
 unhone bataaya tha ki sisai or khunti ke ataki or chibasa ko chhodkar anya sabhi vidhansabha kshetron main matdaan shantipurna dhang se sampann hone kii khabar he
 During the voting, one villager was killed and two others were injured in firing by security forces after a clash with the security forces villagers in Sisai

 Murarilal Meena, Additional Director General of Police and Nodal Officer for Security Affairs in Jharkhand elections, had said that there was a clash between the villagers and security personnel in Sisai in the morning over something that some anti-social elements took advantage of to snatch weapons from RPF personnel at booth number 36 After the attempt, one villager was killed in RPF firing while two other persons were injured, whose treatment was not good

 com The Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday decided that instead of opposing the arrest of its leader Arvind Kejriwal, it would go door-to-door to tell the people why the former Delhi Chief Minister preferred to go to jail instead of facing a bond of criminal defamation
 tihaad jail main band kejariwal se guuruuvaar subah kai 'aap' netaaon ne baatcheet ke baad yah nirnay kiya
 Senior AAP leader Ashutosh said, "during a conversation with Arvind Kejriwal, it was decided that the party would not hold any protest against the arrest of its leader

 The angry chief minister demanded an unconditional apology from the Governor for his controversial remarks and tarnishing the image of the state government and insulting the people of the state

 Bhardwaj has written in his letter citing the order of the Supreme Court, "the Governor has the right to take an independent decision on the basis of the available material and hence the recommendation made in the Cabinet's decision to quit considering the petition itself
" is unfair
 ’ bharadwaj ne kaha, ‘aapako pataa he ki bhoomi ghotaalon, bhrashtachar or sarkari jameenon ke adhigrahan or gaiyr adhishuchet karne se sambandhit niyamon main herpher se sambandhit aarope sitambar 2010 se niyamit media main dikhaai diye
 He said that several organizations had leveled allegations of corruption of a serious nature against the Chief Minister's Office, who directly met him
 ye unki (yediurppa kii) nijee nishtha par sawaal khadaa karte hai
 The Governor said that the Chief Minister did not give any details in the December 15 letter seeking factual information on the allegations against him

 The governor made comments like 'ulta chor kotwal ko dante', which caused angry Yeddyurappa to ask him for an unconditional apology
 yediurppa kaa kahana he ki bharadwaj ne unke mantrimandal par aisi tippanee kar rajya ke logon kaa apmaan kiya he

 Even after this, if the government does not listen, then the option of indefinite strike after Deepawali is open
 eiemtisi ke upaadhyaksh harish sabharwal ne kaha ki jiesti main transportron ke panjikaran ko lekar asanmajas kii sthiti he
 On one hand the government says that registration is optional, but the provision is such that registration is mandatory
 unka kahana he ki iske alaava bhijiastiko lekar anya dikkate hai, jise dur kiya janaa jaruri he
 Similarly, the transporter's business is affected by daily fluctuations in diesel prices, as 70% of the expenditure is on diesel
 iske saath sadak par bhrashtachar bada mudda he

 raveesh kumaar ji
 
 
 The The voice trembling suddenly stopped on the phone
 ji, main bol rahaa hum
 
 
 You are speaking 
 
 main bihar ke bhabhua zile ke ek gaanv se bol rahaa hum
 i am very upset in this age
 koi sunata nahin he
 i write a letter to the Finance Ministry, no response comes from there
 bank vaale ko likh chukaa hum, baar-baar daud rahaa hum, koi jawaab nahin detaa he
 He also wrote the Ombudsman of the Reserve Bank of India in Patna
 sirf itnaa kehane bhar se, ki main hi bol rahaa hum, udhar se aati awaz express mail kii tarah raftaar pakadaney lagi
 Very much explained that you breathe a little and tell it comfortably, then the voice of the elderly started to stop
 dekhie raveesh babu, main skool main principal rahaa hum
 My name is Indra Bahadur Singh
 75 saal kaa hum betaa
 i watch your program on TV
 saal 2001 main ritair kar gaya
 He got a pension of two and a half million rupees annually, so he lived in the village
 koi tex nahin katataa tha
 As the DA progressed from year to year, my pension increased to a little over three lakhs
 maine pan card ke liye aavedan kar diya tha
 Done in 1998 and 2003, but the PAN card arrives this April
 pan card nahin hone ke kaaran bank vaale ne automatic tids kaat liya he
 The government says that PAN card will be available in 48 hours
 meri galati thi ki pan card nahin banwaaya, lekin maine aavedan to kar hi diya tha
 Now if the maker has not given the PAN card then he should also be punished or not
 pan card nahin hone par meraa to tex kaat liya, lekin jisane pan card banane main deree kii, uske khilaaf koi karrwai nahin hui
 The speak of the principal continued
 main bas unki is pareshaani ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 Was wondering who could do what in this case
 sar, main kya kar saktaa hum isamen
 i know, you can't do anything
 jab vittamantri ko likhane se kuch nahin hua to aap kya kar sakate hai
 i just want to tell you my point
 is pareshaani main bhi principal sahab kii awaz kii khanak ne 'saransh' film ke anupam kher kii yaad dilaa di
 i have to say to you that when the bank has already deducted TDS, should i get its certificate or not
 desh ke liye hi tex kaata na, main to uskaa hisaab nahin maang rahaa, bas itnaa kah rahaa hum ki certificate milanaa chahie
 TDS deducted for 2013-14 and 2014-15, give us a certificate
 haa sar, aapako certificate to milanaa chahie
 But Ravish Babu is not giving the bank person
 main sasaram inkam tex afasar ke paas bhi gaya
 The officer also called the banker asking why they are bothering an elderly person, so the banker started scaring me that you have gone to the Income Tax Officer, now you will be raided
 maine kah diya ki main master rahaa hum
 If there is no more than a disproportionate asset, then why would it be raided? aap meraa certificate dijie
 And i am saying, many people like me are upset here
 bank kaa chakkar lagaate-lagaate thak gaye hai
 Some have died, but TDS certificate is not available
 jise dekhie, vahi khaali bhaashan de rahaa he ki ham raah chalate garib kii baat karte hai, magar ham to saamaanya jan hai or apni baat karne main sakasham bhi hai, lekin koi hamaari baat hi nahin sun rahaa he
 Today my taught children are professors in Banaras Hindu University, also IAS officers, but i am not able to get a certificate
 sarkaar badi-badi companiyon ke tex maaf kar detii he or ham jaise logon ke tex kaat leti he
 Definitely cut, but give TDS certificate
 tippaniyan Such calls keep on coming in the afternoon
 bahut sari chitthiyaan bhi aati hai
 Everyone is upset with some officer or employee
 sabake kaam behad maamuli hai, lekin maheenon se dhakke kha rahe hai
 The principal only spoke about himself, did not say anything to me
 yahi kaha ki aap donon paksh kii baat dikhaaiye
 Not just me, but also take the side of State Bank of India
 main nahin chahta ki aap sirf meraa kaam karen, lekin sarkaar ko pataa to chale
 How would the government know, would the government not really know
 yahi soch rahaa tha ki principal sahab ne dher sara aashirwad dekar phone rakh diya
 Yes, i am speaking
 
 
 aap bol rahe hai
 
 
 i am speaking from a village in Bhabua district of Bihar
 main is umr main bahut pareshaan hum
 No one listens vitt mantralay ko chitthee likhata hum, vahaan se koi jawaab nahin aata
 Have written to the banker, running again and again, no one answers
 patna main reserve bank of india ke ombadsman baithte hai, unako bhi likhaa
 Just by saying that i am speaking, the voice coming from there started picking up speed like express mail
 bahut samajhaayaa ki aap zaraa saans lijie or aaraam se bataaie to buzurgavaar kii awaz kuch thamani shuru hui
 See Ravish Babu, i have been the principal of the school
 meraa naam indra bahadur singh hai
 75 years old son
 aapkaa program tivi main dekhtaa hum
 Retired in 2001
 dhai lakh rupaya salanaa pension miltaa tha, so gaanv main rahane laga
 No tax was deducted
 saal-dar-saal die badhate-badhate meraa pension teen lakh se kuch zyaada kaa ho gaya
 i had applied for PAN card
 1998 or 2003 main kiya, lekin pan card is april main aayaa he
 Due to not having a PAN card, the bank has deducted automatic TDS
 sarkaar kahati he ki 48 ghante main pan card milegaa
 My mistake was that PAN card was not made, but i had already applied
 ab agar banane vaale ne pan card nahin diya to use bhi sazaa milani chahie ki nahin
 My tax was deducted for not having a PAN card, but no action was taken against the person who delayed making the PAN card
 principal sahab kaa bolnaa jari rahaa
 i was just feeling this trouble of theirs
 yah soch rahaa tha ki koun kya kar saktaa he is maamle main
 Sir, what can i do with this? mujhe pataa he, aap kuch nahin kar sakate
 What can you do when writing to the finance minister did nothing? bas, main aapako apni baat sunaanaa chahta hum
 Even in this trouble, the sound of the principal's voice reminded Anupam Kher of the film 'saaransh'
 mujhe aapse yah kahana he ki jab bank ne tids kaat hi liya to mujhe uskaa certificate milanaa chahie ki nahin
 Tax is not deducted for the country itself, i am not asking for its account, just saying that certificate should be obtained
 2013-14 or 2014-15 kaa tids kaat liya to hamako praaanpatr do
 Yes sir, you should get a certificate
 lekin raveesh babu, bank vaala nahin de rahaa he
 i also went to the Sasaram Income Tax Officer
 afasar ne bank vaale ko phone bhi kiya ki ek bujurg ko kyon pareshaan kar rahe hai to bank vaale ne mujhe daraana shuru kar diya ki aap inkam tex afasar ke paas gaye hai na, ab aapke yahaan chapa padegaa
 i said that i have been the master
 aay se adhik kii sampatti hi nahin he to chapa kyon padegaa
 You give my certificate or main kah rahaa hum, mere jaise kai log yahaan par pareshaan hai
 Tired of circling the bank
 kuch mar gaye hai, par tids kaa certificate nahin mil rahaa he
 Look at him, he is giving an empty speech that we talk of the poor on the way, but we are ordinary people and are able to speak our own but no one is listening to us
 mere padhaaye hue bachche aaj banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay main professor hai, iees afasar bhi hai, lekin main ek certificate nahin le paa rahaa hum
 The government waives the taxes of big companies and deducts the taxes of people like us
 zarur kaate, magar tids certificate to de de
 The comments dopaher ke vakt aise phone aate rahete hai
 a lot of letters also come
 har koi kisi na kisi adhikari yaa karmchaaree se pareshaan he
 Everybody's work is very minor, but has been raging for months
 principal sahab ne sirf apni baat hi bataai, mujhase kuch kaha nahin
 He said that you should show the point of both sides
 sirf meri baat nahin, balki state bank of india kaa bhi paksh lijie
 i do not want you to just do my work, but the government knows
 sarkaar ko kaise pataa chalata hoga, kya sarkaar ko vaaki pataa nahin hota hoga
 He was thinking that the principal gave a phone with a lot of blessings
 aap bol rahe hai
 
 
 i am speaking from a village in Bhabua district of Bihar
 main is umr main bahut pareshaan hum
 No one listens vitt mantralay ko chitthee likhata hum, vahaan se koi jawaab nahin aata
 Have written to the banker, running again and again, no one answers
 patna main reserve bank of india ke ombadsman baithte hai, unako bhi likhaa
 Just by saying that i am speaking, the voice coming from there started picking up speed like express mail
 bahut samajhaayaa ki aap zaraa saans lijie or aaraam se bataaie to buzurgavaar kii awaz kuch thamani shuru hui
 See Ravish Babu, i have been the principal of the school
 meraa naam indra bahadur singh hai
 75 years old son
 aapkaa program tivi main dekhtaa hum
 Retired in 2001
 dhai lakh rupaya salanaa pension miltaa tha, so gaanv main rahane laga
 No tax was deducted
 saal-dar-saal die badhate-badhate meraa pension teen lakh se kuch zyaada kaa ho gaya
 i had applied for PAN card
 1998 or 2003 main kiya, lekin pan card is april main aayaa he
 Due to not having a PAN card, the bank has deducted automatic TDS
 sarkaar kahati he ki 48 ghante main pan card milegaa
 My mistake was that PAN card was not made, but i had already applied
 ab agar banane vaale ne pan card nahin diya to use bhi sazaa milani chahie ki nahin
 My tax was deducted for not having a PAN card, but no action was taken against the person who delayed making the PAN card
 principal sahab kaa bolnaa jari rahaa
 i was just feeling this trouble of theirs
 yah soch rahaa tha ki koun kya kar saktaa he is maamle main
 Sir, what can i do with this? mujhe pataa he, aap kuch nahin kar sakate
 What can you do when writing to the finance minister did nothing? bas, main aapako apni baat sunaanaa chahta hum
 Even in this trouble, the sound of the principal's voice reminded Anupam Kher of the film 'saaransh'
 mujhe aapse yah kahana he ki jab bank ne tids kaat hi liya to mujhe uskaa certificate milanaa chahie ki nahin
 Tax is not deducted for the country itself, i am not asking for its account, just saying that certificate should be obtained
 2013-14 or 2014-15 kaa tids kaat liya to hamako praaanpatr do
 Yes sir, you should get a certificate
 lekin raveesh babu, bank vaala nahin de rahaa he
 i also went to the Sasaram Income Tax Officer
 afasar ne bank vaale ko phone bhi kiya ki ek bujurg ko kyon pareshaan kar rahe hai to bank vaale ne mujhe daraana shuru kar diya ki aap inkam tex afasar ke paas gaye hai na, ab aapke yahaan chapa padegaa
 i said that i have been the master
 aay se adhik kii sampatti hi nahin he to chapa kyon padegaa
 You give my certificate or main kah rahaa hum, mere jaise kai log yahaan par pareshaan hai
 Tired of circling the bank
 kuch mar gaye hai, par tids kaa certificate nahin mil rahaa he
 Look at him, he is giving an empty speech that we talk of the poor on the way, but we are ordinary people and are able to speak our own but no one is listening to us
 mere padhaaye hue bachche aaj banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay main professor hai, iees afasar bhi hai, lekin main ek certificate nahin le paa rahaa hum
 The government waives the taxes of big companies and deducts the taxes of people like us
 zarur kaate, magar tids certificate to de de
 The comments dopaher ke vakt aise phone aate rahete hai
 a lot of letters also come
 har koi kisi na kisi adhikari yaa karmchaaree se pareshaan he
 Everybody's work is very minor, but has been raging for months
 principal sahab ne sirf apni baat hi bataai, mujhase kuch kaha nahin
 He said that you should show the point of both sides
 sirf meri baat nahin, balki state bank of india kaa bhi paksh lijie
 i do not want you to just do my work, but the government knows
 sarkaar ko kaise pataa chalata hoga, kya sarkaar ko vaaki pataa nahin hota hoga
 He was thinking that the principal gave a phone with a lot of blessings
 sirf itnaa kehane bhar se, ki main hi bol rahaa hum, udhar se aati awaz express mail kii tarah raftaar pakadaney lagi
 Very much explained that you breathe a little and tell it comfortably, then the voice of the elderly started to stop
 dekhie raveesh babu, main skool main principal rahaa hum
 My name is Indra Bahadur Singh
 75 saal kaa hum betaa
 i watch your program on TV
 saal 2001 main ritair kar gaya
 He got a pension of two and a half million rupees annually, so he lived in the village
 koi tex nahin katataa tha
 As the DA progressed from year to year, my pension increased to a little over three lakhs
 maine pan card ke liye aavedan kar diya tha
 Done in 1998 and 2003, but the PAN card arrives this April
 pan card nahin hone ke kaaran bank vaale ne automatic tids kaat liya he
 The government says that PAN card will be available in 48 hours
 meri galati thi ki pan card nahin banwaaya, lekin maine aavedan to kar hi diya tha
 Now if the maker has not given the PAN card then he should also be punished or not
 pan card nahin hone par meraa to tex kaat liya, lekin jisane pan card banane main deree kii, uske khilaaf koi karrwai nahin hui
 The speak of the principal continued
 main bas unki is pareshaani ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 Was wondering who could do what in this case
 sar, main kya kar saktaa hum isamen
 i know, you can't do anything
 jab vittamantri ko likhane se kuch nahin hua to aap kya kar sakate hai
 i just want to tell you my point
 is pareshaani main bhi principal sahab kii awaz kii khanak ne 'saransh' film ke anupam kher kii yaad dilaa di
 i have to say to you that when the bank has already deducted TDS, should i get its certificate or not
 desh ke liye hi tex kaata na, main to uskaa hisaab nahin maang rahaa, bas itnaa kah rahaa hum ki certificate milanaa chahie
 TDS deducted for 2013-14 and 2014-15, give us a certificate
 haa sar, aapako certificate to milanaa chahie
 But Ravish Babu is not giving the bank person
 main sasaram inkam tex afasar ke paas bhi gaya
 The officer also called the banker asking why they are bothering an elderly person, so the banker started scaring me that you have gone to the Income Tax Officer, now you will be raided
 maine kah diya ki main master rahaa hum
 If there is no more than a disproportionate asset, then why would it be raided? aap meraa certificate dijie
 And i am saying, many people like me are upset here
 bank kaa chakkar lagaate-lagaate thak gaye hai
 Some have died, but TDS certificate is not available
 jise dekhie, vahi khaali bhaashan de rahaa he ki ham raah chalate garib kii baat karte hai, magar ham to saamaanya jan hai or apni baat karne main sakasham bhi hai, lekin koi hamaari baat hi nahin sun rahaa he
 Today my taught children are professors in Banaras Hindu University, also IAS officers, but i am not able to get a certificate
 sarkaar badi-badi companiyon ke tex maaf kar detii he or ham jaise logon ke tex kaat leti he
 Definitely cut, but give TDS certificate
 tippaniyan Such calls keep on coming in the afternoon
 bahut sari chitthiyaan bhi aati hai
 Everyone is upset with some officer or employee
 sabake kaam behad maamuli hai, lekin maheenon se dhakke kha rahe hai
 The principal only spoke about himself, did not say anything to me
 yahi kaha ki aap donon paksh kii baat dikhaaiye
 Not just me, but also take the side of State Bank of India
 main nahin chahta ki aap sirf meraa kaam karen, lekin sarkaar ko pataa to chale
 How would the government know, would the government not really know
 yahi soch rahaa tha ki principal sahab ne dher sara aashirwad dekar phone rakh diya

 baithak ke baad isisi chairman shashaank manohar ne kaha, 'aaj isisi or duniya bhar main cricket ke bhavishya ke liye ahm din tha
 In 2014, the ICC Board has accepted the Working Group's proposal for constitutional and financial changes to change the accepted issues and now together we will give it the final draft in April
 isse bisisiai ke naye netritv ko bhi sari baarikiyon ko samajhane or apana yogadan dene ke liye samuchit vakt milegaa
 i want the ICC to have a rational and impartial attitude towards all its 105 members, which the revised constitution and financial model will do

 Srinivasan's reasoning behind this was that these three countries earn the most, hence their rights are also higher
 lekin shashaank manohar ne isisi main pad sanbhaalane ke baad is prastaav ko galat bataaya
 After the meeting, ICC Chairman Shashank Manohar said, "today was an important day for the future of ICC and the world cricket
 2014 main sweekrut baton ko badalane ko lekar varking group ke sanvaidhanik or vittiya badlaav ke prastaav ko isisi board ne maan liya he or ab ham sab ek saath ise april main aakhri praaroop denge

 main chahta hum ki isisi apane saare 105 sadasyon ke prati tarksangat or nishpaksh ravaiya rakhe, sanshodhit samvidhan or vittiya model yahi karegaa
 Some things have to be considered, there are some apprehensions but change has got a theoretical consensus

 unhone donon prastaavon ko april 2017 main isisi kii agali baithak main uthaane kii guzarish kii lekin bahumat ke aadhaar par unki guzarish ko thukraa diya gaya
 According to the proposal brought in the tenure of n Srinivasan in 2014, the BCCI would have earned Rs 3400 crores from the ICC by 2023, which many countries had objected to
 iske peeche shrinivasana kaa tark tha ki in teenon deshon se hi sabase zyada kamai hoti he, isliye inkaa haq bhi zyada banataa he
 But Shashank Manohar, after taking office in the ICC, called the proposal wrong

 At six o'clock on Thursday, President Pranab Mukherjee is going to honor the players with the National Sports Awards, but there are controversies that they are not giving up the pursuit of these awards
 is baar phir rahul dravid ko lekar vivaadon ne janm liya he
 Recently retired cricketer Rahul Dravid was considered the strongest contender for the 'rajiv Gandhi Khelratna' award, but now the award will never be given to him
 is puraskaar ke liye dravid se behatar daavedaar ko dhundhna bhi mushkil mana ja rahaa tha, lekin purv olympic padak vijeta rajyavardhan rathod kii adhyakshata main bani cameti ne landan olympic main jite gaye padakon ko ahmiyat dete hue nishanebaaj vijay kumaar or pahalwaan yogeshwar dutt ko li se hatakar yah sammaan dene kaa faisla kiya
 This also made it clear that Dravid, who has retired from cricket, will no longer be given the Khel Ratna Award
 haalanki, bisisiai ne dravid kaa naam padmabhushan ke liye bhejne kaa faisla kiya he, jo desh kaa teesraa sabase bada naagarik sammaan he or ab tak nau cricketron ko padmabhushan se nawaja ja chukaa he
 The controversy started in 2005, when Rajyavardhan Rathore, who won a silver medal in the 2004 Athens Olympics, was given the Arjuna Award in the same year and the Khelaratna Award in the following year
 is baar puraskaron kii chayan samiti ke adhyaksh khud rathod the, lekin unhone dravid kii bajaay olympic padak vijetaon ko khelratna dene kaa faisla kiya
 In this way the old rules were also broken and disputes were also called
 haalanki, khel puraskaron ke liye tay taarikh ke biit jane ke baad jab khel mantralay ne cricketron ke liye alag chhot di, to lagane laga tha ki ab rahul dravid ko is saal khelratna puraskaar se jarur nawaja jayega
 On this entire episode, former cricket captain Bishan Singh Bedi has said that there has been some lapse, because Rahul Dravid does not need to prove his eligibility for any award and he is the best cricketer to our knowledge
 iske alaava, hameshaa kii tarah is baar bhi kai aise khilaadi hai, jo arjuna or duusare khel puraskaron kii chayan prakriya par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Some have called for an answer from the Sports Ministry raising questions through RTI, while some are asking to go to court
 ullekhneey he ki saurav ganguli or anil kumble se lekar mahesh bhupati jaise kai aise diggaj khilaadi hai, jo kaabiliyat ke baavjood 'rajeev gandhi khelratna' puraskaar ke hakdaar nahin ho paae
 Obviously, these names will always stand as a question before the selection committees of this award
 vivaadon main rahanaa khel puraskaron kii fitrat ban gai he or agar is baar yah puraskaar dravid ko, or agali baar olympic padak vijetaon ko diya jaataa, to na vivaad hote or na hi kisi ko aitraaj hota
 The comments vaise, raashtrapati bhawan main guuruuvaar shaam yojit hone ja rahe samaaroh main nishanebaaj vijay kumaar or pahalwaan yogeshwar dutt ko desh ke sabase bade khel sammaan 'rajeev gandhi khelratna' se nawaja jayega
 Apart from these, Arjuna Awards will be given to 25 other players, including cricketer Yuvraj Singh, hockey player Sardar Singh, women wrestler Geeta Phogat, badminton player p Kashyap and Ashwin Ponnappa, women archers Deepika Kumari and Bombayla Devi
 landan olympic main padak vijeta susheel kumaar or yogeshwar dutt ke coach yashavir singh, mahila athlete krishna punia ke coach virender singh, boxing ke coach biai furnandis or hockey coach harendra singh sahit aath kochon ko dronacharya puraskaar die jaaenge
 This time again controversies have arisen regarding Rahul Dravid
 haal hi main sanyas lene vaale cricketer rahul dravid 'rajeev gandhi khelratna' puraskaar ke sabase majboot daavedaar maane ja rahe the, lekin ab yah puraskaar unhen kabhi nahin diya ja sakegaa
 It was also considered difficult to find a better contender than Dravid for the award, but the committee, headed by former Olympic medalist Rajyavardhan Rathore, gave the shooters Vijay Kumar and wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt leaking importance to the medals won at the London Olympics
 Decided to give away this honor
 isse yah bhi saaf ho gaya ki cricket se ritair ho chuke dravid ko ab aage khelratna puraskaar nahin diya ja sakegaa
 However, the BCCI has decided to send the name of Dravid for Padmabhushan, which is the third highest civilian honor in the country and so far nine cricketers have been awarded the Padma Bhushan
 vaise vivaadon kii shuruyaat varsh 2005 main hi ho gai thi, jab 2004 ke athens olympic main rajat padak jeetne vaale rajyavardhan rathod ko usee saal arjuna puraskaar or agle saal yani 2005 main khelratna puraskaar de diya gaya tha
 This time the chairman of the awards selection committee was Rathore himself, but he decided to give Khelratna to Olympic medalists instead of Dravid
 is tarah puraane niyam bhi tode gaye or vivaadon ko bhi bulaava diya gaya
 However, when the Sports Ministry gave a separate relaxation for the cricketers after the deadline for the Sports Awards, it seemed that now Rahul Dravid will be conferred with the Khel Ratna Award this year
 is puure prakaran par purv cricket captain bishan singh bedi ne kaha he ki kahin na kahin koi chook hui he, kyonki rahul dravid ko kisi bhi puraskaar ke liye apni yogyata siddh karne kii jarurat nahin he or vah hamaari jaankaree main behtareen cricketer hai
 Apart from this, as usual this time too there are many players who are questioning the selection process of Arjuna and other sports awards
 kuch ne artiai ke jariye sawaal uthaate hue khel mantralay se jawaab talab kiya he, jabaki kuch adaalat jane kii baat kah rahe hai
 It is noteworthy that there are many such legendary players from Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble to Mahesh Bhupathi who, despite their abilities, could not get the 'rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna' award
 jaahir he, ye naam is puraskaar kii chayan samitiyon ke aage hameshaa sawaal banakar khadey rahenge
 Staying in controversy has become the nature of sports awards and if this award was given to Dravid and next time Olympic medalists, there would have been no controversy and no objection
 tippaniyan By the way, shooter Vijay Kumar and wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt will be conferred with the country's highest sporting honor 'rajiv Gandhi Khelratna' at the ceremony to be held in Rashtrapati Bhavan on Thursday evening
 inke alaava, 25 anya khilaadiyon ko arjuna puraskaar die jaaenge, jinamein cricketer yuvaraj singh, hockey khilaadi sardaar singh, mahila pahalwaan gita phogat, badminton khilaadi pi kashyap or aswin ponppa, mahila teerandaaj deepika kumari or bombaila devi shaamil hai
 Dronacharya Awards will be given to eight coaches, including London Olympic medalists Sushil Kumar and Yogeshwar Dutt coach Yashveer Singh, female athlete Krishna Poonia coach Virender Singh, boxing coach BI Fernandes and hockey coach Harendra Singh
 is puraskaar ke liye dravid se behatar daavedaar ko dhundhna bhi mushkil mana ja rahaa tha, lekin purv olympic padak vijeta rajyavardhan rathod kii adhyakshata main bani cameti ne landan olympic main jite gaye padakon ko ahmiyat dete hue nishanebaaj vijay kumaar or pahalwaan yogeshwar dutt ko li se hatakar yah sammaan dene kaa faisla kiya

 input-ians virendra sahvaag england ke khilaaf mumbai main shuukravaar se hone vaale duusare test match main utarane ke saath hi 100 test match khilne vaale duniya ke 54wein or bharat ke nauven cricketer ban jaaenge
 At the same time, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who started his Test career almost three and a half years before this explosive batsman, will have to wait for this
 england ke khilaaf vartmaan siries se pehle sahvaag or harbhajan donon ke naam par 98-98 test match darj the
 Sehwag is a regular member of the team but Harbhajan, who has not played any Test for the last year and a half, has no place in the playing XI
 bharat ke do mukhya spinneron aar aswin or pragyan ojha ke ahmedabad main pehle test match main achche pradarshan ko dekhte hue harbhajan ko mumbai main bhi mauka milane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 By the way, Sehwag will also have to wait till the third Test match to be held from December 5 in Kolkata for India to complete the hundreds of Test matches
 asal main sahvaag ne ek match vishwa ekadash kii taraf se khelaa tha or is tarah se bharat kii taraf se unke naam par abhi 98 test match hi darj hai
 Sehwag, who made his Test debut in November 2001, was excited about playing 100 matches since the start of the series
 unhone kaha tha, ‘meraa pehla sapana desh kii taraf se khelnaa tha
 After that i started dreaming of playing 100 Test matches
 mujhe khushi he ki yah kshan jald hi aayega
 It is a great honor
 ’vahiin bhajji ko of spinner ko pehle do test match ke liye team main rakhaa gaya he
 If India decides to go with three spinners, then only Harbhajan will get a chance in Mumbai as Ashwin and Ojha together took 13 wickets in the first Test match in Ahmedabad
 aswin haalanki chaar wicket le paye the lekin mana ja rahaa he ki captain mahendra singh dhoni vijayi team main kisi tarah kaa badlaav karnaa pasand nahin karenge
 As far as Sehwag is concerned, it is certain that he will play his 100th Test match at the Wankhede Stadium
 unke liye yah aitihaasik kshan hoga kyonki yah un sachin tendulkar kaa gharelu maidan he jinke par sarvaadhik 191 test match khilne kaa ricard darj he
 Indian cricketers who have played more than 100 Test matches so far include Rahul Dravid (164), VVS Laxman (134), Anil Kumble (132), Kapil Dev (131), Sunil Gavaskar (125), Dilip Vengsarkar (apart from Tendulkar)
 116) and Sourav Ganguly (113)
 ye to ham sabhi jaanate hai ki saamaanya pani kii jagah ublaa hua pani istemaal karnaa phydemand hota he lekin jis tarah har cheez ke do pahalu hote hai, vaise hi is prakriya ke bhi do rup hai
 One is beneficial and the other is harmful
 jitani baar aap pani ubaalte hai iske avyavon main badlaav aa jaataa he
 Due to which it is no longer beneficial for health as well as the amount of arsenic, nitrite and fluoride is also increased in it
 pani ko bahut adhik ubaalane se usamen kai khatarnaak tatv aa jate hai
 Boiling poisonous nitrite water too much increases the amount of nitrite in it, which is a component of this
 pani ko bahut adhik ubaalane se nitrite jehar main badal jaataa he
 High temperature converts nitrite to nitrosamine
 joki jaanalevacancer kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 The amount of arsenic in it increases by boiling the arsenic volume too much
 arsenic kii adhikta vaala pani pine se jaanaleva cancer, heart atake or kai tarah kii maansikbimariyaan hone kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 People who have been drinking arsenic polluted water for years become victims of many skin diseases
 fluraide kii maatra bad janapani ko bahut adhik ubaalane se usamen fluraide kii maatra bad jaati he
 Drinking such water for a long time affects the bones
 bachche agar aisa hi pani pi rahe hai to un par iskaa bahut hi bura asar hota he
