 ramajaan shuru ho gaya he, chand dikhne ke baad se roje rakhane kii parampara he
 In the coming month, the Muslim community will keep fasting and worship Allah
 ramajaan ke puure maheene kuch khaas baton kaa dhyaan rakhana jaruri he
 Let us know which things should be kept in mind: 1
 insaan ramajaan kii har raat usase agle din ke roje kii niyat kar saktaa he
 It is better that on the first night of the month of Ramadan, decide the fast of the whole month
 2
 If someone intentionally sets another fast in the month of Ramadan, other than the fast of Ramadan, then that fast will not be accepted nor will it be included in the fast of Ramadan
 3
 It is better that you buy the required items for the whole month before the month of Ramadan starts, so that you do not have to wander outside in the condition of fasting and you can spend more time in prayer
 4
 Drink more and more water after Iftar in the month of Ramadan
 dinabhar ke roje ke baad sharir main pani kii kaaphi kami ho jaati he
 2 at least men
 5 litre or auraton ko kam se kam 2 litre pani jarur pinaa chahie
 5
 iftaar kii shuruyaat halke khaane se karen
 Iftar is considered better than dates
 iftaar main pani, salad, fal, zeus or soup zyada khaaen or pien
 This will complete the lack of water in the body
 6
 Do not eat too much fried, spicy, sweet food in Sahari, because eating such food makes thirst more
 sahari main otmil, doodh, bread or fal sehat ke liye behatar hota he
 7
 ramajaan ke maheene main zyada se zyada ibaadat karen, allaah ko raji karnaa chahie kyunki is maheene main kar nek kaam kaa sawab badha diya jaataa he
 8
 ramajaan main zyada se zyada quran kii tilavat, namaaj kii pabandi, jakaat, sadaq or allaah kaa zikr karke ibaadat karen
 Iftar to Rojedars is considered to be a great job
 9
 If a person sets fast and sleeps during the time of Sahari, then sleep will be considered as a fast, but it is right
 10
 The month of Ramadan is divided into three Ashars
 pehle 10 din ko pehla ashara kehete hai jo rahamat kaa he
 The second Ashra is said to be the next 10 days which is of Magafirat and the third Ashra is said to be the last 10 days which is of Ajati from Jahannam
 11
 If a person intentionally eats something in the condition of fasting, then their fast is broken, but if someone accidentally eats something, then their fast does not break
 12
 If a sick person recovers before Zohar in the month of Ramadan and by then he has not done any work that breaks the fast, then it is necessary to keep his fast for that day
 13
 If the food stuck in daily teeth is swallowed intentionally, then its fast breaks
 14
 Swallowing mouth water does not break the fast
 agar kisi lajij khaane kii khwaahish se munh main pani aa jaae to us pani ko nigalane se rojaa nahin tuutata he
 15
 ramajaan ke maheene main insaan buree laton se dur rahata he, cigarette kii lat chhodane ke liye ramajaan kaa maheenaa bahut acha he
 Eating cigarettes or tobacco by keeping rosa breaks the fast
 16
 In the condition of fasting, getting the teeth removed makes rosaro gooseberry, or by doing some work that starts bleeding from the mouth, it also becomes rooster
 17
 If you are wearing fully wet clothes in the condition of fasting, then your Roja can be Capricorn
 18
 Any food whose food breaks the rosa, is forcefully put into the chasm of an employee and if they swallow it, the fast does not break
 19
 If a person is forced to eat food by threatening the loss of life and property, and the person does not break the fast, if the person consumes food to avoid that loss
 20
 In the month of Ramadan, the virtue of goodness is increased from 10 to 700 times
 nafl namaaj kaa sawab ferj ke baraabar or ferj kaa sawab 70 ferj ke baraabar ho jaataa he
 21
 ramajaan ke maheene main allaah apane bandon par khaas karam farmaata he or uski har jaij dua ko kubul karata he
 In Ramadan the doors of paradise are opened and the doors of Jahnum are closed
 22
 After the Namaz in Ramadan, make Quran Pak tilawat habit, it is very good
 ramajaan main kuch vakt nikaalkar quran-e-majid ko sunen, kyunki ramajaan kaa lamhaa-lamhaa ibaadat or sawab kaa he
 23
 ramajaan ke maheene main koshish karen ki aap har vakt ba-vaju rahen
 Get into the habit of sleeping early at night so that you can get up for prayer prayers
 24
 Before going to bed every night, think about the amalas you have made
 apane nek aamaal par allaah kaa shukr adaa kiijie or apni galatiyon or kotaahiyon ke liye allaah se maafee maangiye or tauba kiijie
 25
 ramajaan ke maheene main rojaanaa saddaka karne kii aadat daalen, chaahe thodaa hi kyun naa ho
 Make it a part of your everyday life
 26
 Do the Naafl prayers in Ramadan like the prayers of Tahajud, it is very good
 zyada se zyada vakt quran or hadith, phikah or islamic kitabon ke mutale main guzaaren
 27
 kisi aise aadmi ko iftaar kii daavat den jo aapkaa jaankaar ho, aap mahasoos karenge ki aapke rishte or bhi majboot ho gaye hai
 Try to have all the people in the house together iftar together
 28
 In Ramadan, give up all your bad habits and use this ba-barkat month in noble deeds
 ramajaan main apane padosiyon ko hameshaa yaad rakhen or unka khyaal rakhen

 Former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's book 'ayodhya: 6 December 1992', he has made full mention of the incident of the idol and what happened after it
 raav ne apni kitaab main likhaa he ki police adhikari ramdev dube ne ipisi kii dhara 147 / 448 / 295 ke tahat exiaar darj kii jisamen likhaa he ki 50 se 60 log ghus gaye or mandir ke andar murti rakh di

 But now Anna Hazare also finds it insulting to call Kejriwal his disciple
 emsidi chunaav ke baad ralegan siddhi main anna hajaare ne ajtak ke saath khaas baatcheet kii
 In the conversation, he targeted Arvind Kejriwal fiercely
 'ahankaar kaa shikaar hue kejariwal'anna hajaare kaa kahana tha ki kejariwal ke siem banane ke baad unhone salaah di thi ki wo dilli ke vikaas par dhyaan den
 But Kejriwal did not listen to them
 aam chunaav main patkhni khaane ke baad bhi unhone punjab, goa or upi main party ke vistaar main zyada takat lagaai
 Hazare's allegation was that Kejriwal is now eyeing the pm's chair and this is the result of the ego car born from the victory in Delhi 
 'kejariwal ko kursi kaa nasha'hajaare ne yaad dilaayaa ki kejariwal ne mukhyamantri banane ke baad gaadi, bangale jaisi suvidhaayen naa lene kii baat kahi thi
 But he failed to live up to it
 unke mutabik dilli ke siem ko kursi kaa nasha ho gaya he
 'kejriwal's mlas are corrupt' Believe Anna Hazare, he warned Kejriwal that it would not be easy to test people of character in the party
 lekin aam aadmi party ne bina soche samajhe sadsyta abhiyaan chalaaya
 The result of this is that many ministers of Kejriwal are surrounded by serious allegations
 'kejariwal par rhite tu ricol lagu'ek vakt tha jab anna hajaare or arvind kejariwal milakar 'rhite tu ricol' kii vakaalat kiya karte the
 But now Hazare believes that these rights should first apply to the Delhi government
 unhone is maamle main dilli congress ke pradeshdhyaksh ajay maakan kii misaal di jinhone haar kaa jimmaa lete hue istipha de diya tha
 But in Hazare's opinion, there is power in Kejriwal's mind, so he will not do it
 'kejariwal kaa guru kahana apmaan jaisaa'anna hajaare kaa kahana tha ki unhone ab kejariwal ko salaah dena chhod diya he kyonki unke dimag main paisa or satta baithi he
 He said, 'arvind calls me Guru but he is not capable of being my disciple
 isiilie wo mujhe kabhi phone nahin karata or maine bhi use kabhi phone nahin kiya
 To call me his Guru is an insult to me

 She is on the list of Bollywood's Most Fit Actress
 43 saal kii umr main bhi ve ekadam yang lagati hai
 His fashionable style and style are all convincing in sense
 kuch dinon pehle ajay devgan ke bete kaa bhi ek fitness video viral hua tha
 He took the # humfittohindiafit Fitness Challenge
 7 saal ke nanhen yug ke is fitness video ne kai logon ko hairaan kiya tha
 The way Yuga was seen doing workouts in the gym at a young age, he was capable
 congress party main ek nai charchaa shuru hui he, buudhe netaaon ke bare main
 Janardan Dwivedi says that leaders above the age of 70 should retire from active politics
 unhen salaahkaar kii bhoomika nibhaani chahie
 He believes that there should be an age limit for those living in public life like other professionals
 party ke mahatvapurn padon par rahane waalon ko bahut bhagdaud kerani hoti he or kam umr ke log unke liye upyukt hote hai
 Earlier, former minister Jairam Ramesh had said that the Congress leaders who have been 70 years, should retire
 congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne pehle hi yuva netaaon par zyada vishwaas jataayaa tha
 On the other hand, PM Modi has removed old leaders from active positions in his party
 unki kor team main zyaadaatar netaa kam umr ke hai or vah un par puraa bharosa jataa rahe hai
 It has become clear that after the sidelining of leaders like Lal Krishna Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi, there is no active place for old leaders in BJP
 bhartiya raajnneeti kii yah ajab vidambnaa rahi he ki zyaadaatar mahatvapurn padon par buudhe netaa haaavee hote rahe hai
 Many political leaders who were physically incapacitated have also been seated in important positions

 He was able to stay in this post for only six months and went to heaven
 kehane kaa matlab saaf he ki atyadhik umr ke netaaonko mantri yaa aise mahatvapurn pad dena koi samajhadaari nahin he
 Physically, they are not as strong and neither is intelligence at that age
 isse bhi bady baat yah he ki sava sau karod logon ke desh main kam umr ke yogya raajnneetigyon kii kami nahin he
 Every party has young or less elderly leaders who can work far better in every important position
 unki utpaadakta bhi kahin zyada hogi
 In today's changing times, leaders and people in important positions also have to work at a fast pace
 wo log jo shaareerik or maansik rup se kahin sakasham hon, unhen zyada jimmedaari dena uchit hoga
 India is going to be the youngest country in the world with the largest number of youth
 aise main unki tarah kaa soch rakhane vaale raajnneetigyonki bhi jarurat he
 Their aspirations and expectations have to be understood
 desh ko agar behatar dhang se chalaanaa he to unki adhik se adhikbhagidaari honi chahie
 Every party has to understand this
 bijepi ne to isaki shuruyaat kar di he
 The Congress has started thinking about this
 yarchha sanket he or aane vaale dinon main iske achche parinaam dekhne ko milenge

 The Home Secretary of Jammu and Kashmir has advised Amarnath travelers and tourists to leave the valley immediately by advising them
 adwijuri ke baad amarnath yatri kashmir se waapas lautne lage hai
 According to the information, when this decision was taken, some passengers were in the middle of the road, while some were around the station
 ve sabhi ab vahaan se apane-apane gantavy ko lautne lage hai
 In fact, the security forces received a sniper rifle during a search operation on the route of the Amarnath Yatra, after which it was decided to stop the yatra
 aatanki khatre ko bhaanpate hue turant ye adwijuri kii gai ki amarnath yatri amarnath yatra maarg main jahaan kahin bhi hai wo apane-apane gharon kii taraf lautne kii koshish karen, kyonki unpar hamale kii badi sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 The Home Secretary of Jammu and Kashmir has written in the advisory that this advice is given in the interest of Amarnath pilgrims and tourists keeping in mind the recent input of the Intelligence Department and the security situation of the Kashmir Valley on the threat of targeting the Amarnath Yatra
 It is to immediately reduce their stop in the valley and take measures to return as soon as possible

 In such a situation, this advisory will raise the question whether everything is fine in Kashmir? Is something big going to happen in Kashmir?

 ) agle saal loksabhaa chunaavon kii taiyaariyon memrashtriya swayamsevak sangh(aresas) jute chukaa he
 RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has started connecting the castes first through 'rashtrodaya: Swayamsevak Samagam' in Banaras, then Agra and the next day in Meerut
 jaateey or vaicharik matbhinnataaon main gaiyr rajnatik manch se samanta kaa sandesh dekar sangh 'hindutv or kattarta' kii nai paribhaasha lekar utraa he, jisamen hindutv kaa matlab puraa desh or kattarta kaa arth udaartaa he
 But is the Sangh's agenda with political implications really attracting those castes and ideologies that consider the BJP to be anti-bjp or themselves 'saffron victims' in the political arena? It is important to know why this question arises and Why did RSS need social engineering? In fact, in the 2014 general election, the Hindu votes that were polarized towards the BJP included a decisive number of other backward classes and Dalits
 2017 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main yah sameekaran barkaraar to rahaa lekin 2014 ke anupaat main ghat gaya
 In addition to the events in the bjp-ruled states, the statement of Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat ending reservations before the Bihar elections is also seen
 uttar pradesh main bhaajapa sarkaar banane ke baad saharanpur jile ke shabbirpur gaanv main daliton or rajputon ke bich hui jaateey hinsa kii ghatnaon ke baad sangh kii soshal ejineering main teji ai he
 Activism and vigilance are clearly visible in this state, because the way to reach the central power is not possible without Uttar Pradesh
 2014 main bhaajapa or sahyogiyon ko 73 loksabhaa siten upi se hi mili thim or isamen pashchimi uttar pradesh kaa mahatvapurn yogadan tha
 On the second day of Meerut's 'rashtrodaya: Swayamsevak Samagam', on February 25, Sangh chief Bhagwat gave a message in his address to over two lakh volunteers, "one should have bigotry for generosity and non-violence
" tyaag or sanyam jaise mulya kisi ek puja yaa sampradaay ke nahin hote
 Radical Hindutva refers to staunch non-violence and staunch liberalism
 ham khud ko bhul gaye hai or jatiyon main bantakar ladaai karte hai
 The whole world bakes bread on the fire of our quarrels
 '' bhagwat pehle bhi kah chuke hai, ''bharat main rahane vaala har vyakti hindu he
 "indeed, a large hoarding was clarifying the message of Bhagwat's Meerut address on February 23 at Agra's 'samrasata Sangam' stage
" hording ke thik bich main shabari ke haathon se ber khate bhagwaan ram or iske irdagird sant ravidaas, sant kabirdaas, maharishi valmiki or gautam buddha ke chitra or thodi duuri par duusare manch par virajman sabhi samaaj ke sant or mahatma
 That is, from Varanasi to Tajnagri Agra and Meerut the message is clear that the Sangh has started connecting the castes before 2019
 sangh ke aise samagam pehle bhi hue hai par pehle bhagava ke saath nila rang kabhi najar nahin aayaa
 In Agra, on the blue banner below the platform of saintly mahatmas, "the stream of discrimination will break with the harmonious life, only this whole nation has become ours
" '' meerut main samagam sthal ko raat main neeli lite se roshan kiya gaya tha
 Ramkumar, secretary of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, Uttar Pradesh, explains a big reason behind this, "every time the Sangh comes forward, it talks about embracing, adding caste but there is no initiative to break caste
 upi main bhaajapa shashan ke das maheenon main dalit utpeedan kii ghatnaayen kareeb 20 fisadi badi hi hai
 The Sangh never directs accountability to the BJP

 ek baar phir budghijiviyon or itihaaskaaron se itar sansad main baithe rajanetaaon ke dabaav ne vidhyaarthiyon ke paathyakram main apane man-mutabik pherbadal ko anjaam diya he
 Last year, during the monsoon session of Parliament, mps of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Bahujan Samaj Party created a lot of uproar in the Rajya Sabha over their demand
 is had tak ki do baar sadan ko sthagit karnaa padaa
 After this the Ministry of Human Resource Development wrote a letter to NCERT in this regard and suggested to include this 19th century adventuress who was fighting the freedom struggle against the British
 ab parishad is maang kii taarkikta se sahamat thi yaa vah rajanetaaon ke dabaav main aa gai? india today ne jab parishad kii diarector ganitagya parveen singhlair se is sambandh main baat karne kii koshish kii to unhone koi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 Whatever the reason, Avantibai of the Lodhi caste, currently belonging to the princely state of Rajgarh in Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh, has been included in the NCERT Class VII history book
 1857 main aazaadee kii pehali ladaai ke dauraan unhone british hukumat ke khilaaf ladaai ladi thi
 He ruled in the princely state of Rajgarh, now in Mandla district
 lok kathaon main unka zikr jarur miltaa he, lekin iske alaava unke bare main zyada jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 The princely state of Rajgarh is in ruins
 vah ek maamuli gaanv bhar he
 Historian Surendra Mishra living in Bhopal has written a book on Avantibai
 itihaas kii kuch anya pustakon main bhi unka zikr miltaa he
 But they were not mentioned in the history books and school textbooks, this was the complaint of the mps

 Rajiv Bhargava, a political expert and member of the committee that produces political science books, says, "I can bet that there will be at least a hundred names that are not included in the textbook
" netaaon ke paas acha bahaanaa he, unhen shaamil karwaane kaa
 But the question is when will it be controlled? paathya-pustak kaa makasad vidyarrthi ko soochnaaon se ladanaa nahin he
 The council, after consulting its academics, added a new part to the history book
 lekin rajeev bhargav kaa maananaa he ki isaki soochna un logon ko bhi di jaani chahie, jo is pustak ke lekhan kii prakriya main shaamil rahe hai
 He says, "all the suggestions should be collected in one place and necessary and important changes should be made from time to time
 lekin kisi bhi samay kisi aadmi kii sanak or ichha se koi badlaav kar dena katai uchit nahin he, chaahe vah koi rajaneta hi kyon na ho
 "mps have the right to raise this issue and there are many such examples before us," says Arjun Dev, former chairman of the social science department of NCERT
 jab sansad ke hastkshep se kitaab main mahatvapurn badlaav hue
 But it is also necessary to be aware that the demand for adding or subtracting any part is not motivated by any political motive

 There is not a single leader like him in Delhi, he is very cautious while saying this and also very humble to put himself in front of himself as the hero of national change: "india today lacks leaders, policy and intentions 
 ” helicopter se gandhinagar waapas jate vakt ve india today se aisa kehete hai
 We asked why they do not want to replace that leader, so their answer is flat that their work in Gujarat is not yet complete, "I want to make Gujarat more developed than most developed countries" (talk)
 janamat surveykshan main modi saaf vijayi banakar ubhar rahe hai
 56 percent of the voters of Gujarat want to see him as the next Prime Minister of India and in this case he is far ahead of Rahul Gandhi
 unki apni party ke pratidwandvi jaise sushamaa swaraj, nitin gadakari or arun jetali surveykshan main dahaai bhi paar nahin kar paae hai or modi ke mukaable apraasangik ho chuke hai
 As the survey shows, Modi's popularity is made up of his record of development (his greatest achievement) and an honest image free of corruption stains (his greatest strength)
 modi badlaav kii jo ibaarat likh rahe hai, use rajnatik sandarbh main rakh kar dekhen to tasviir or saaf najar aegi
 For example, Manmohan Singh in Delhi, despite his last stakes of economic reforms, is no longer a symbol of modernity, but on the contrary he has become a symbol of a stagnant India because in his era India was in the quagmire of corruption and political non-accountability
 The sun is gone
 aaj antarrashtriya prakashnon ke aavaran or sampadakeey prishthon par bharat ke aadhunik chehre ke rup main modi ko jagah mil rahi he
 Britain has emerged as their latest fan following, which had kept Gujarat on the black list since 2002
 gandhinagar main modi ke saath ek bahuprachaarit baithak ke baad hui press conference main britain ke ucchayukta ne kaha ki modi or ‘bibrant gujarat’ ke saath rishta kaayam karnaa britain ke rashtriya hit main he
 An influential section of the Indian corporate world has already stamped him as the country's most qualified candidate
 bachi unki apni party, to uske bheetar sabhi unke saamne boune najar aa rahe hai kyonki modi iklaute netaa hai jo jamini str se lekar bordroom tak apil karte hai or yah sab ek aise vakt main hua he jab khud party adhyaksh apni saakh bachaane ke liye jujh rahaa he (nitin gadakari par report)
 Kaushal Mehta, founder and CEO of Motif, an Ahmedabad-based outsourcing company, says, "if a clean man like Modi becomes Prime Minister, it would be a completely unique experience for India as a nation
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki ve pradhanmantri banenge
 Bimal N
 of Gujarat National Law University
 patel ke mutabik, modi ‘‘aaj tak paidaa hue mahanatam gujarati hai
 "patel, who has worked as a legal expert with the United Nations, believes that" living in Gandhinagar today is an experience equivalent to living anywhere in Western Europe
 ”ho saktaa he ki aisi prashansa gujarati vaibhav ke bhav se janmi ho, lekin jaisaa ki janamat surveykshan bhi rekhaankit karata he, ek prashaasak ke taur par modi kaa ubhaar aise teen gunon par tikaa he jo maujuuda bhartiya raajnneeti main durlabh haih eemaandaaree, aarthik morche par sakaaratmak nattejey dena or yuvaaon kaa bhavishya sunishchit karne ke sandarbh main aisi vishwasaneeyata jo aaj bharat ke kisi bhi netaa ko mayssar nahin he
 This Modiist index of prosperity does not derive from election campaigning, statistics also test it
 kuch aankadon par najar daalen
 Under Modi's leadership, Gujarat, like China, has increased in double digits
 pichley 10 saal ke dauraan rajya main krishi kshetra ne 10
 Increased at the rate of 97 per cent, the highest in India
 rajya ke saare shaharon or takreeban sabhi gaanvon main chabison ghante bijli aati he
 The automobile industrial center he has established close to Ahmedabad has become a success story
 isamen koi aashcharya nahin ki adhiktar matadaata maanate hai ki 2012 ke chunavi nattejey vikaas ke mudde se tay honge or adhiktar logon ke liye rajya main hue audyogikaran ne bade paimaane par rojgaar ke avasar paidaa kiye hai
 Despite all this, it is worth noting that the effect of the hatred industry which was set up here in 2002 has not completely disappeared
 yah baat alag he ki 60 fisadi matadaata modi ko dangon kaa jimmedaar nahin maanate
 But they are still unpopular among Muslims: 61 percent of Muslims will not vote for them, more than 50 percent of Muslims believe that Modi has not treated them in the last five years, while 55 percent are Muslims who say that if Modi riots They will not vote for him even if he apologizes for it
 modi, jinaki koi bhi raily muslim tapiyon ke bagaiyr puri nahin hoti, chunaav vishleshan kii vishwasaneeyata ko zyada tavajjo nahin dete
 He told India Today, "I don't do vote bank politics
 chah karod gujarati mere parivaar ke log hai
 "modi's most important warlord Amit Shah, who has been on political exile for nearly two years due to the court's decision, could not bear the brunt on his return these days
 india today se baatcheet main ve modi jaisi kootnithik jabaan nahin bol pate
 Shah says, "forget Modi, only BJP can never accept Muslims
" ”modi ke rajnatik aabhamandal ko ghere kisson par vishwaas karen to gandhinagar ke log modi ke alaava yadi kisi kii saraahna karte hai to ve akele shah hai
 When it comes to standing behind his leader, Shah does not confuse, "the greatest speaker after Nehru
" 
 
 pradhanmantri ke taur par modi kaa vikalp hi nahin he
 This has to happen
 ” aisa kab hoga, is bare main ve kuch nahin kehete
 He is most angry with those who have maligned his mentor and played with public perception
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘ve unhen hitler kaise kah sakate hai? loktantr main jo chhot mili hui he, modi uskaa sabase bada shikaar hai
 Not only this, some people are promoting their aggressiveness towards injustice and appeasement as their aggression
 kam-se-kam ham logon kii dharna ko badalane ke liye uske saath samjhauta nahin kar sakate or jab ve 2002 ke dangon ke jimmedaar hai hi nahin, to bhala ve maafee kyon maangen?”iske baavjood ahmedabad ke congress karyaalay main chale jaaen to aapako har koi modi ko kosta milegaa
 For Badruddin Sheikh, leader of the opposition in the civic body, "modi is a devil and Muslims are scared by his name
" ” gandhinagar main satta parivartan ko lekar aashwast rajya congress ke mukhiya arjuna modhwadiya kehete hai ki ‘‘gujarat main rajya pryojit hatyakand” ke kaaran ‘‘unhone apane dost or saathi kho die hai
 Unmasking Modi's much-publicized Muslim support, Modhwadia tells India Today that under the Right to Information Act, he has discovered that a district administrator had purchased 10,000 Muslim caps to be distributed among BJP workers
 modi ke sahruday sparsh ko rajnatik naatak qaraar dete hue ve daawa karte hai, ‘‘modi kii prachaar raily main muslim topi pahane saare log jaruri nahin ki muslim hon
 i do not have proof, but i can tell you that BJP also distributes burqas
 ” balasinore main modi ko aane kaa nyotaa begum farhat ne diya tha jo khud burka nahin pahenti hai
 "the time has come for the Muslim community to leave 2002 behind," she tells India Today
 ve jab chah karod gujaratiyon ke kalyaan kii baat karte hai, to kisi bhi hoshamand ko usamen khot nahin dikhni chahie
 “modi is the bestselling idea in the politics market
 ek aisa vichaar jo sapaat aakhyaanon ko chunauti detaa he, jo bharat ke maanas main paithne kaa koi mauka nahin chukta
 Modi is the inspiration, Modi is the threat
 ve jitani aasaani se saraahna pate hai, utani hi sahajata se uttejit bhi karte hai
 The person who most Indians want to see as their next Prime Minister, takes into account extreme feelings
 haalanki unke chaahane vaale bhi ek baat to maanate hai ki modi kii bhavanaaen utani paardarshee nahin hai, shaayad yahi vajah he ki unhen logon kii prashansa to milti he, lekin pyaar nahin miltaa
 As one of his ceos says, "his image needs to be repaired
" ” yah bhi to ho saktaa he ki bhartiya raajnneeti kii laharon kii sabase tej sawari karne vaala shaks apni aakhri manzil par“pahunchane ke baad apane jajbaat ko jaahir kare

 ek to kejariwal ke dilli sarkaar main rahete hue naakaamiyon ko punjab main prachaarit karnaa he or is bahaane punjab kii 23 siton par party kaa prachaar bhi hoga
 On Monday, along with Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari, Union Minister of State Rajyavardhan Rathore also reached the BJP office to flag off Yuva Morcha workers riding on bikes

 In this report, 70 promises made before Kejriwal's election are the basis
 punjab main jaakar ab bijepi ke kaaryakarta vahaan ke votaron ko saavdhaan karenge ki jaise dilli main aam aadmi party ne jhuthe vaade kiye hai, usee tarah se ab punjab kii janata ko bahakaane kii koshish kejariwal or unki party kar rahi he
 That's why they should be careful
 dilli bijepi ne dilli main sarkaar kii naakaamiyon ko lekar prachaar samagri taiyaar kii he
 It talks about free wifi, safety of women, construction of new schools and CCTV cameras
 dilli bajapi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki dilli ko dhokhaa dekar kejariwal punjab bhaag gaye hai, isliye unako talashkar dilli se kievadon kii yaddilane unke kaaryakarta punjab pahunch rahe hai
 Rajyavardhan Rathore did not miss this opportunity to target Kejriwal and he said that his poll was exposed in Delhi
 isliye wo ab munh chhupaakar punjab bhaage hai

 rahul gandhi ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya he
 All the further possibilities were made public by Rahul's resignation letter
 saath hi congress ko 'gandhi parivaar' se mukt rakhane kii disha main bhi kadam badha diya he
 In view of this, Rahul Gandhi has also pulled a line that the new president of Congress will be outside the 'gandhi family'
 rahul gandhi ne yah faisla aise samay main liya he jab congress apane sabase bure daur se guzar rahi he
 Not only this, after the Lok Sabha elections, the party seems completely stuck in the limelight
 aise siyaasi maahaul main congress adhyaksh pad chhodana or nae raajnneetik prayog ke liye jo kadam uthaa rahe hai usase yah sawaal khadaa hota he ki rahul kahin political risk to nahin le rahe hai
 With Rahul Gandhi's decision, it has become clear that after 21 years, the Congress will once again be in the hands of another leader outside the nehru-gandhi family
 indira or rajeev ke baad 'gandhi parivaar' se sonia gandhi 1998 main adhyaksh baniin or 2017 tak is pad par raheen
 During this period, the Congress held power at the Center for 10 years
 sonia gandhi ke baad congress adhyaksh ke taur par rahul gandhi kii tajposhi disambar, 2017 main hui thi
 However, Rahul Gandhi made a political entry in 2004 and became national general secretary in 2007 and later held the post of vice president
 is dauraan rahul gandhi ne congress sanghathan ko nai dhar dene ke liye lingadoh cameti ke tarj par khadaa karne kii koshish kii thi
 Apart from this, many political experiments were done for many candidates, in which he could not succeed
 raajnneetik prayog main vifal rahe rahulrahul mahasachiv ke pad par rahete hue enesayuai or youth congress sanghathan main sidhe padon par chayan ke bajaay chunaav ko tarjeeh diya
 While vice-president, Rahul Gandhi tried out the voting process formula in his constituency for candidate selection before fielding the candidate in the election
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main candidet ke chayan main shakti ap ko rahul ne ahmiyat di thi
 Rahul Gandhi has failed badly in these three experiments
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki congress ko gandhi parivaar ke sahare kii maansikta se mukt karne ke kadam main rahul gandhi kahaan tak safal honge?youth congress main 1977 jaisaa nahin rahaa josh or jajbacongress kii siyasat ko lambey samay se dekhne vaale varisht patrkaar shakeel akhtar kehete hai ki rahul gandhi ne apana faisla soch samajhakar liya he
 In the kind of idealistic and values-based politics that Rahul Gandhi wants to do, he wants to not only win but also establish his ideals and values
 yahi vajah rahi ki unhone apane chaatr or youth sanghathan main loktantric vyavastha ko lagu karne ke liye chunaav karaane kaa kadam uthaaya tha, jise lekar party ke andar virodh rahaa
 Despite this, they maintained it and the party had to bear the brunt of it
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki youth congress main pehle jaisaa josh or jajba nahin dikhaa
 When Indira Gandhi lost the elections in 1977, Congressmen across the country came out on the road and shouting slogans that 'eat half the bread will bring back Indira', but this time 40 days after the defeat of the Lok Sabha elections, when the Congressmen sat on a sit-in So their number was very less
 lagata he ki isse rahul gandhi ko bada jhatka laga he, jiske baad unhone apane istife ko saarvajanik kiya
 Shakeel Akhtar says that leaving the post of Congress President, Rahul Gandhi is taking a lot of risk
 ab rahul raajnneeti main kis bhoomika main rahenge yah kahana abhi mushkil he
 Whether or not he will return to the presidency cannot be said
 haalanki paanch saal kaa vakt bahut lanbaa he aise main hamen lagata he ki do dhai saal baad priyanka gandhi party kii kaman sanbhale, kyonki haar ke baad se vah sakriy hai
 He says that Rahul Gandhi has been very liberal, the result of this is that the Congress did not listen to his words
 indira gandhi paanch saal main teen mukhyamantri badal detii thi, lekin sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi dilli main shila dikshit or assam main tarun gogai ko 15 saal mukhyamantri bane rahane diya
 What has happened to it is in front
 vahiin bijepi or narendra modi kisi ko kuch banaate hai to uske peeche raajnneetik makasad chipa hota he
 Shakeel Akhtar says that many things have to be seen for the election of the new president of Congress
 gandhi parivaar ke prati vafadari ke saath-saath yuva or saamaajik-jaateey sameekaran kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga, nahin to congress kii dasha or disha or bhi kharaab ho jaaegi
 Party president journalist Arvind Singh could not handle the president outside the Gandhi family, saying that Rahul Gandhi should not have resigned from the post of Congress President in such a time
 rahul ke netritv main congress bhale hi loksabhaa chunaav haar gai he, lekin 2009 main unke netritv main upi main 22 siten party jeetne main safal rahi he or pichley saal teen rajyon main congress jeet darj kar satta main ai thi
 In this way, Rahul was established as a common leader
 vah kehete hai ki pichley tees saalon main gandhi parivaar se baahar ke jo bhi congress adhyaksh rahe hai, uske anubhav ko dekhen to vah party ko sambhaal nahin paae hai
 During Narasimha Rao's era, veteran Congress leaders such as Narayan Dutt Tiwari rebelled from the party and formed a separate party, which later returned to the era of Sonia Gandhi
 iske alaava party main jis tarah se netaaon se lekar kaaryakartaaon ke bich gutbaji he, use gandhi parivaar kaa sadsy hi sadhakar rakh saktaa he
 However, even after Rahul Gandhi is not Congress President, he will remain important as a mass leader
 varisht patrkaar rashid kidawai ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ke paas istipha dene ke sivaa koi or vikalp nahin bachaa tha
 Except the 'gandhi family', the rest of the party leaders do not want to work hard
 congress ke seedblusi main shaamil netaaon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Whereas in other parties, from leader to worker are seen struggling
 yahi vajah he ki rahul gandhi ne apane faisle se saaf sanket de diya he ki aisi sthiti main to chunaav nahin jeeta ja saktaa he, agar party ko jeet darj kerani he to sabko mehnat kerani hogi
 After 1989, no member of the Gandhi family has become the Prime Minister, on the same lines, a step is being taken to keep the Congress organization free from the Gandhi family
 vahiin, varisht patrkaar umakant lakheda kehete hai ki rahul gandhi is baat ko bakhubi samajhate hai ki congress jis haalat main he, uskaa chaal, charitra or cheharaa badale bagaiyr narendra modi or amit shah ke tantra se muqabla nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In view of this, he has resigned from the post of president
 darasal congress main kai aise mathadhish netaa he, jinke chalate rahul gandhi apane faislon ko party main lagu nahin kar paa rahe the
 Now Rahul Gandhi has resigned and hit many targets with one stone
 iske jariye rahul gandhi congress main bane alag-alag power centre kii bediyon ko todane ke saath hi bijepi ke nerrative ko bhi todane kaa kaam karenge
 Washington Sundar of Rising Pune Supergiant got his name in the record book as he entered the match against Mumbai India in the final of IPL on Sunday
 ipel kaa final match hyderabad ke rajeev gandhi stadium main khelaa ja rahaa he

 is match main sundar ne 16 ran dekar teen wicket liye the or unke is pradarshan kii badaulat pune ne mumbai ko 20 ran se haraakar final main jagah banaai thi
 However, Washington Sundar's record in the final match was different
 ipel ke final main khilne vaale sundar sabase kam umr ke khilaadi hai
 Washington is 17 years old 228 days old
 washington sundar apni gendon ko bahut zyada turn nahin karaate hai
 They don't even fly the balls much but with their accurate bowling, they are able to take the tough test of batting
 ipel10 main washington sundar ne final sahit 11 match pune kii team kii ore se khele

 Similarly, when Manish Pandey came to the IPL final in 2009, his age was 19 years 256 days

 Okri, who lives in London, started a new experiment in 2009 by writing a line of poetry on Twitter a day
 unhone twitor par sabase pehle ‘ai singh a new freedom’ kavita post kii thi
 He then posted two more poems
 2012 main yah teenon kavitaayen ‘wild’ naam ke ek kavita sangrah ke rup main saamne ain
 Okri said 'after this i felt that enough is enough

 In the same vein of religion and spirituality, the group of fake babas is playing with people's beliefs
 aise gurughantalon kii apane desh main koi kami nahin he
 Find one thousand and now another new baba has joined this list
 mahamandaleshwar swami jyotigiri maharaj urf iees baba
 This Baba was also playing with the faith of the people by opening the shop of Babagiri
 par ek din achaanak baba kaa asli cheharaa soshal media par viral ho gaya
 So take your profession in the market of devotion is a completely new baba
 naam he mahamandaleshwar swami jyotigiri maharaj
 On hearing such a heavy name, it seems as if he has descended for the salvation of the earth
 karunaa ke sagar
 Reserves of knowledge
 paap or paapiyon ke sanhaarak
 Meaning everything will be their left hand game
 magar janaab baba ke naam par mat jaaiye
 If you go on the name, you will get confused
 gurugram ke ye baba jitne bade naam se nazar aate hai
 They are equally as well
 soshal media par jaakar dekhie baba kii karunaa or lagaav ke video viral hue pade hai
 In which Baba is recorded committing obscene acts with his sages
 magar ab inke bhi honeymoon period kaa time puraa ho chukaa he
 Their poll has also been revealed
 ganimat rahi ki baba ne back-ap plan taiyaar kar rakhaa tha or baba bhakton ke hathe chadhne se pehle hi nikal liye
 Otherwise, they too would be adorning the prison of a district
 haalanki mahamandaleshwar swami jyotigiri maharaj ke karname bilkul vaise hi hai jaise ki unase pehle vaale baabaaon ke the
 Who are currently adorning the prison
 samajaseva ke naam par ashram kholaa
 Showed the power of devotion
 phir usee bhakthi kii aad main mahila sadhviyon kaa yon shoshan karne laga
 And when persecuted for fear of being caught, Boriya got out of bed
 baba ke bare main ham kisi nattejey par nahin pahunch rahe hai
 But their videos are viral on social media
 or ye khud bhi ashram main taala laga kar gaayab hai
 At least that can be said and a victim Sadhvi is giving testimony of Baba's exploits
 baba par aarope lagaate hue soshal media par ek gumnaam mahila ne text video post kiya or uske baad kuch video bhi daale
 Whose bottom line is something like this
 soshal media par viral post main gumnaam mahila kaa kahana he 'jyotigiri maharaj ne mere saath jabardastee sambandh banaae
 Jyotigiri Maharaj has sexually abused hundreds of minor girls
 main kam se kam das se baarah ladakiyon ke saath baba ke khilaaf shikaayat karne ko taiyaar hum
 But Baba is very powerful and my life is in danger
 'mahila ne post main ye bhi daawa kiya ki uske paas jyotigiri maharaj ke aise 600 ghante ke video hai jinamein wo naaballig ladakiyon ke saath yon shoshan karata hua dikh rahaa he
 
 or to or is mahila ne apni post main jyoti giri maharaj kaa puraa kaccha chittha khol ke rakh diya he
 
 iske alaava is gumnaam mahila ne apni post main likhaa he
 In a viral post on social media, the anonymous woman says' i am not coming forward yet
 kyonki main jaanati hum ki jyoti giri bahut shaatir or khatarnaak shaitan he
 He would kill me as soon as he had even a little bit of strength
 main ise range haathon pakadvaana chaahati hum
 And when it is in the custody of the police, i will bring many more girls to testify against it in the court
 mere paas jyoti giri kii 11 mahilaon ke saath 600 ghante kaa video he
 Of which i am sending some clips
 puri video kuch news channel ko bhej rahi hum or you-tub par daal rahi hum
 It is taking a while due to the video being long
 magar unka link bhi main aap sabhi ko bhej duungi
 All of you are requested that if Jyoti Giri gets me murdered, then bring it to its end
 'khabar ke mutabik police ne baba ke khilaaf to cese darj kar hi liya hi he
 But the anonymous woman posted this video on social media
 us mahila ke khilaaf bhi police ne iti act ke saath ipisi kii dhara 509 ke tahat maamla darj kar liya gaya he
 Because the matter is also related to the privacy of another woman

 ’raashtrapati karyaalay ke ek adhikari ne is ashaanti ko purv raashtrapati mamoon abdul gayyum kii takhtapalat kii koshish qaraar di
 Nasheed defeated him in the country's first democratic presidential election in 2008
 latif ne kaha ki yah sena kii ore se takhtapalat bilkul nahin he
 However, the security forces advised Nasheed to resign
 unhone kaha, ‘yah takhtapalat nahin he
 Not at all
 ’baad main uparashtrapati mohammad vaahid ne naye raashtrapati kaa padbhaar sambhala jabaki sarkaar ne teen lakh sunni aabaadi se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil kii he

 'this entire crisis is seeing a very serious impact on the tourism industry, which is considered to be the backbone of the country
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne mangalvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi se mulaakaat kii or bihar main ai baadh ke halaat ke bare main pradhanmantri ko bataaya
 Nitish Kumar said that floods in Bihar can be avoided every year only when the Ganga sediment is cleaned
 unhone kaha ki baadh se bachane kaa yahi ekmaatr rasta he
 In his half-hour meeting with the Prime Minister, Nitish Kumarka said that a team of experts should be sent to take stock of these conditions made in Bihar
 pradhanmantri ne nitish kumaar ko centre kii taraf se har sambhav madad kaa aashwaasan diya
 The PM said that all possible help will be provided by the Center
 pradhanmantri se milane ke baad media se baat karte hue nitish kumaar ne kaha, 'maine pradhanmantri ko bihar kii kuch jilon main baadh setabahike bare main bataaya or unako kaha ki bihar main jo baadh kii sthiti bani he aisa pehle kabhi nahin hui
 This situation can be avoided only when the sediment is cleaned '
 nitish kumaar kaa he ki aisi sthiti se nipatane ke liye ek rashtriyatalchat nitiki jarurat he
 While talking to the media, Nitish Kumar said that he wants to cry over the condition of Ganga in Bihar
 pradhanmantri ko nitish kumaar ne kaha jo centre sarkaar kii namaami gange pariyojna he agar samay rahete is par dhyaan nahin diya gaya to is par sawaal uth jayega, kyonki rajya main ganga kii haalat thik nahin he
 Significantly, the floods in Bihar have caused great devastation
 20 jilon main kareeb 5 lakh log prabhavit hue hai, jisamen se kareeb 2 lakh logon ke ghar baadh main dub gaye or kheti kaa bhi nuksaan hua he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the first telephone call to Myanmar and Australia to call Barack Obama on Republic Day
 us samay tak is vichaar par paryaapt raay-mashvira nahin ho paaya tha lekin modi samay nahin ganvaana chaahate the or unhone vyapaar suvidha samjhaute (tiefee) par jari gatirodh kii samaapti par donon netaaon kii baatcheet ke dauraan iskaa zikr bhi ched diya
 The US president showed keen interest in this but asked for some time to respond
 yah ravaiya unki sarkaar ke shuruaati kuch maheenon se bilkul alag tha jab vija mudde kii vivaadaaspad prishthbhumi ke chalate yah jabardast bahes chhidi hui thi ki modi ko sitambar main america kii yatra kerani chahie yaa nahin
 The Prime Minister not only visited there but also expressed his intention to take the relationship to a new height
 is yatra ke dauraan modi ne obama ko bharosa dilaayaa ki vishwa vyapaar sanghathan kii baithak main bharat vyapaar suvidha samjhaute ke raste kii baadha nahin banegaa or phir america ke tay samay seemaa sambandhi jid chhodie ke saath jald hi samjhaute par sahmati ban gai
 In this way, Obama reached out to Modi during dinner at the East Asia Summit in Nai Taw and hugged him and described him as "man of action"
 magar ganatantr diwas ke aamantran par koi baat nahin hui
 In the informal atmosphere of the G20 summit in Brisbane, Modi again mentioned it
 yah mauka modi or australian pradhanmantri tony abt kii baatcheet ke dauraan aayaa
 The conversation was about the urban architect and planner Walter Burley Griffin, who built the city of Canberra and designed all the buildings of the British Raj era in Lucknow, including the magnificent Lucknow University building
 modi ne yah zikr kar obama ko baatcheet main shaamil kar liya ki griffin kaa janm chicago main hua tha or andruni sutron ke mutabik, jab pradhanmantri ne obama ko phir se apane aamantran kii yaad dilaai to abt katkar rah gaye
 Obama's stance was positive and US officials later stated that all he had to do was to see that the program had no conflict with the State of the Union speech
 modi ke dilli pahunchane ke baad sweekruti mil gai or phir sheeghra hi aupchaarik nimantran bhi bhej diya gaya
 Little is known that before the Brisbane meeting, when officials were briefing him, Modi tapped Griffin's Chicago relationship
 unhone yahaan tak kaha tha ki ve obama ke saath baatcheet shuru karne ke liye iskaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Apparently, America was overshadowed by Modi's mind and there are legitimate reasons
 masalan, america ke saath majboot rishta vaishvik aarthik jagat main is kadar sakaaratmak asar daalata he ki germany, japan or yahaan tak ki australia jaise anya taqatvar deshon ke saath bhi kaarobaar karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 Not only this, this relationship affects the decisions of investors around the world which is very important for Modi's economic agenda
 aarthik pahalu ke alaava modi kii anya dikkaton, khaskar pakistan se nibatane ke liye bhi america mahatvapurn hoga
 Given the strict policy that his government has adopted so far on Pakistan, it would not be appropriate for New Delhi for Washington to take a double stand, especially in the event of a terrorist attack or the Kashmir issue
 bharat-america sambandhon main garmjoshi kii tanik bhi kami badi aasaani se in muddon par washington ko apane puraane dharre par pahunchaa sakati he
 The same thing applies to China, especially when it comes to cooperation on the world stage
 yah sahi he ki yahaan beijing ne jalwaayu parivartan par america se dwipaksheeya samjhauta kar ek rasta dikhaaya he
 In this agreement, he agreed to consider 2030 as his peak emission year and thus abandoned the upa's big basic (brazil, South Africa, India and China) strategy
 ab bharat ko bhi ek samjhauta karnaa he or apane urja utpaadan main tapiya ghatak kii vikaas dar ko kam kar vah jald hi lakshya nirdhaarit karne par bhi raji ho saktaa he
 One way to meet such goals would be to increase the share of non-conventional energy and this step would bring civil nuclear energy back to the center of the political stage
 parmaanu daayitv ke mudde par raahat paane kii modi kii kshamta america ke saath sambandhon main mile kaa pathar hogi
 In this way, one arrow will hit three important targets
 ek, bharat-america sambandhon kii profile badhegi
 Secondly, investor confidence in the Modi government will be strengthened, and like China, India will also get a chance to become a partner on climate change
 america ke liye modi asia main use khel main waapas aane kaa ek mauka muhaiyaa kara rahe hai
 This is when his "asia axis" policy failed to produce the expected results
 raksha mantri chak hegal kaa apane pad se istipha tathaa asian ke ahm sadasyon ke bich is ranneeti kii maddham padati aawaaj isi ke pratik hai
 Due to his domestic popularity, he has turned his back on Obama, this strategic move can create many possibilities
 2000 main jab bill clinton ne bharat kaa atyant kaamyaab daura kiya tha to us samay ve lokapriyata ke nimnatam bindu par the
 In 2006 George W
 bush ne apni girti lokapriyata ke baavjood aakhri satr ke dauraan pratinidhi sabha se hide act manjuur karvaa liya tha
 Obama's popularity is also constantly falling, how India's strategic opportunities may be weakened
 bilkul apane purvavartiyon kii tarah modi ko bhi iskaa phayda uthaane se nahin chuknaa chahie

 (1 / 2)— Office of RG (@officeofrg)october 7, 2016the Indian Army in political posters and propaganda all across the country (2 / 2)— Office of RG (@officeofrg)october 7, 2016 In Lucknow, Muslim women have put a mehndi of Modi's name on their hands
 in mahilaon ne apane haathon par namo likhvakar bijepi kaa chunaav nishaan camel bhi banwaaya he or narendra modi ko piem banane kaa sankalp liya he
 These women supporters of Modi gathered at a house in Lucknow's Hassanganj area on Thursday and everyone lovingly put a mehndi of Modi's name on their hands and talked about making Modi the next Prime Minister of the country
 in mahilaon kaa kahana he ki congress ke shashan kaal main pichley das saalon main qamar tod mahangaai badi he or mahilaayein bhi khud ko asurakshit mahasoos kar rahi hai, lihaaja desh ko ek majboot piem kii jarurat he
 Modi supporter Nisha Khatoon, a resident of Lucknow, says, 'congress has been at the center for ten years
 sari mahangaai ham mahilaon ko jhelni padati he
 Whether it is Hindu or Muslim, the whole problem is inflation
 ham chaahate hai ki hamaara majboot piem aae
 Narendra Modi is eligible for this post

 ' Usually we all like to eat sugar mixed in yogurt separately
 pasand se bhi adhik ye swaad kii baat hoti he
 To add sweetness to yogurt, people like to eat sugar by adding sugar to it, but eating sugar separately in yogurt can be harmful, but now Danish researchers have found a solution to this problem
 denmark ke shodhakartaaon ne mithi dahi jamaane main safalataa hasil kii he
 a team of researchers have succeeded in naturally altering the metabolic properties of curd-free bacteria
 iske alaava shodhakartaaon ne sookshmjeev vigyaani tareekon ke upyog sedahi ke lactose ko puri tarah nikaalane kaa tareekabhi dhund nikaala he
 In such a situation, it can now be eaten without adding sugar to the curd
 denmark kii bahurashtriya biosince company henson holding ke upaadhyaksh or shodhakarta erik johansan kaa kahana he ki hamaara lakshya yah tha ki dahi main pai jane vaale bacteria glucose ko na pachaa paae, jo ki chini kaa hi ek meetha rup he or kinvan utpaada he
 We wanted them to eat glucose, but extract glucose back
 yah shodheplide and enwyronmental microbilogimen prakashit kiya gaya he
 According to Johansson, the reason for this is that glucose is sweeter than lactose or galactose, so yogurt bacteria become sweeter when they extract glucose instead of extracting lactose by eating glucose and there is no need to add sugar separately

 bada sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya jaanch ko gumraah karne ke liye kuch chuninda mare huye logon ke naam liye ja rahe hai yaa phir kuch bade log hai jo apana naam ujagar na ho iske liye kuch aropiyon ko raste se hataa rahe hai
 In 2012, 19-year-old Namrata Damore was found dead on the railway track
 namrata medical bhartee ghotaale main aaropee thi
 She was in contact with doctor Jagdish Sagar, the leader of the medical recruitment scam
 kya namrata kai raaj ugal sakati thi, ye sawaal isaliye bhi uth rahaa he kyonki uski maut kii gutthi ab bhi nahin sulajhi he
 In 2013, Namrata's family filed a petition in the High Court demanding an inquiry into the death
 hoicourt ne 8 hafton main jaanch kar report dene ko kaha
 The police has not yet submitted these reports
 kuch aise hi sawaal 8 or mauton par uth rahe hai
 The SIT itself believes that some deaths have hindered its investigation
 lekin ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin ki in mauton ke peeche koi khaas pattern he
 The comments esaiti sandigdh mauton main se kai maamalon ko saamaanya maan rahi he
 He argues that when people are under investigation, they can commit suicide due to stress or fear
 aise kai record estf ne esaiti ko saunpe hai jinase ye saaf hota he ki kai logon ke naam jaanch ke dauraan aae, unki exiaar darj hone se pehle hi maut ho chuki he
 a big question is arising whether the names of select dead people are being taken to mislead the investigation or there are some big ones who are removing some accused from the way for not disclosing their names
 2013 main namrata ke parivaar waalon ne hoicourt main yachika daakhil kar maut kii jaanch kii maang kii
 The High Court asked for an inquiry after 8 weeks
 police ne ab tak ye report nahin saunpi he
 Some similar questions are arising on 8 more deaths
 esaiti khud maan rahi he ki kuch mauton kii vajah se uski jaanch main rukaawat ai he
 But they are not ready to believe that there is a particular pattern behind these deaths
 tippaniyan The SIT considers many of the suspected deaths as normal
 uskaa tark he ki jab log jaanch ke ghere main hote hai to tanaav yaa dar ke maare khudakushi kar sakate hai

 a plush Audi car of a Delhi doctor gets a sudden accident every day
 unki car chaar logon ko kuchal detii he
 All four are killed on the spot
 haadase ke baad maukey par koi nahin miltaa
 Neither the doctor, nor the driver nor any eyewitness
 iske baad achaanak ek shaks khud ko unheen doctor sahab kaa driver bataa kar adaalat pahunch jaataa he
 He takes all the responsibility of the accident
 laga maamla khatm
 The case was resolved
 par asal main ye to bas us golmaal kii shuruuaat bhar thi
 It has shaken the stoves of many minds
 wo 28 sitambar 2002 kii raat thi
 Some people were sleeping on the sidewalk outside a bakery in the Bandra area of mumbai
 lekin aadhi raat ko film star salmaan khan kii tej raftaar toyta land cruzar is footpath se kuch aise guzari ki isane ek hi jatke main ek shaks kii zindagi chin lee
 Made four people forever helpless
 duniya jaanati he ki wo car salmaan khan kii thi
 But it was one day and one today
 14 saal baad bhi ye raaj he ki haadase ke vaqt akhir salmaan kii us land cruzar kaa driver tha koun?ab aaie 2002 se aapako sidhe 2017 main lekar aate hai
 The place then was Mumbai
 is baar he dilli ke qareeb upi kaa indirapuram
 Here too, on the night of 27 January 2017, there is a face-to-face collision between an Audi Q7 SUV and an auto
 is haadase main ek hi jatke main chaar logon kii jaan chali jaati he
 This car belongs to a doctor, who was present in the same car at the time of the accident
 lekin thik salmaan kii car kii tarah yahaan bhi haadase ko puure 10 dinon kaa vaqt guzarane ke baavjood ye baat ab bhi ek paheli bani he ki akhir driver koun tha?is haadase ke thik do din baad bareli ke rahane vaale ishak naam ek shaks ne khud ko doctor kii audi car kaa driver bataate hue ghaziabad court main sarender kar diya
 Also secured bail
 yahaan tak to kahani bilkul sidhi thi, lekin thik paanch rose baad usee pate rahane vaale ek duusare shaks ne jab khud ko ishak bataate hue ye daawa kiya ki usne to kabhi audi car andar se dekhi tak nahin
 This case got badly entangled
 is shaks ne kaha ki wo naa to us audi kaa driver he or naa hi usne court main sarender kar koi zamaanat hi lee he
 He not only made this claim but also presented evidence in support of this claim
 usne kaha wo haadase vaali rose dilli se dur trek lekar ahmedabad gaya tha
 Now this matter was completely entangled
 iske saath hi kai sawaal bhi khadey ho chuke the
 The question is, after the last accident, who was the person who surrendered in court, calling himself Isaac Ahmed? Where did he disappear after getting bail from the court? If he was not really Isaac, then why did he try to mislead the court and the law by becoming Isaac? Obviously, the answer to these questions has hidden the whole story of this complicated Audi accident
 lekin un javaabon ko dhundhane se pehle aaie aapako ek baar us audi kyuu seven ke maalik se bhi milaae dete hai, jo haadase ke vakt usee car main hi maujuud tha
 Audi owner name dr
 manish ravat he, jo safadarajang aspataal ke neuro sarjan hai
 He says the accident occurred due to sudden overtake
 haadase ke baad driver dar se bhaag gaya
 The crowd of people had gathered fast
 bheed use hi driver naa samajhe isliye wo ghar chalaa gaya
 The person who surrendered by calling himself the driver of the doctor's Audi is still missing from the scene
 udhar, ishaak khud ko driver maanane se inkaar kar rahaa he
 While Ishaq's housemates are taking the name of Ishtiaq, a relative of his own, behind this surrender
 yani maamla ab bhi puri tarah se golmaal kaa he
 The question was whether Ishtiaq was throwing dust in the eyes of the court as Ishaq? If yes, why? And at whose behest? In this case, a new character Ishtiaq appeared
 kuch samaj main aayaa? yadi nahin, to chaliye ham hi samajhaate hai
 Isaac's family members living in Bareilly, who claim that their son has never seen an Audi car, are far from driving
 daawa ye bhi kar rahe hai ki jab indirapuram main audi kaa accident hua to unka betaa dilli se dur ahmedabad main tha
 But this is not the only thing
 uske gharavaalon kaa ye bhi kahana he ki audi cond main khud ko ishak bataa kar driver ke taur par adaalat main pesh hone vaala shaks koi or nahin balki unheen kaa ek rishtedaar ishtiya he
 Yes, his relative Ishtiaq, who has done all this sport in the greed of money
 ishak apane ek rishtedaar ishtiya ke saath kuch samay pehle tak kiraye ke ek makaan main hi rahata tha
 He suspects that Ishtiaq fraudulently took out a photo copy of his son Isaac's driving license in those days
 us par apni tasviir chipka kar usne khud ko ishak kaa naam de diya
 Seeing himself as Isaac, meeting the owner of Audi, he also took bail from the court
 maamla tab khulaa jab ishak bataa kar sarender karne ke baad maamle kii taftish karti hui media bareli main ishak ke is ghar tak pahunchi
 Audi's boss and neurosurgeon at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi on this screw of Isaac and Ishtiaq
 manish ravat kaa kuch or hi kahana he
 Dr
 manish kah rahe hai ki jab unhone ishak ko naukari par rakhaa tha, to unhone uske driving linces kaa bairiphication bhi karaayaa tha
 Since then, the same person has been driving his car as Isaac, who has surrendered in the Ghaziabad court
 aise main agar usne koi dhaandhlee kii he, to iskaa jawaab bhi vahi de saktaa he
 Here, on Tuesday, Aaj Tak found that man named Brijesh
 vah adaalat main ishak ke do jamaanti main se ek tha
 Actually, Brijesh gave his half-finished address in the court and in such a situation, the police was looking for Brijesh along with the surrender man
 haalanki phone par baatcheet karte hue brijesh ne kaha ki usne kuch bhi galat nahin kiya
 Now the question arises whether Dr
 manish bhi ishtiya ko hi ishak ke naam se jaanate hai? or kya ab tak ishtiya hi unke paas ishak ban kar kaam kar rahaa tha? agar, yahi sach he to akhir uske farzi driving license kaa veriphication doctor manish ravat ne kaise kara liya? Kota, which has made its mark across the country as a coaching city, is witnessing a big change in the level of thinking in Kashmir
 algaavvaad or aatankwaad se prabhavit kashmir kii vaadi se badi sankhya main chaatr-chatraayen kota aakar yahaan ke mashîr koching institutes main koching le rahe hai
 More than 300 students from Kashmir have traveled to the city of Kota, Rajasthan, hundreds of miles away from Kashmir to prepare for medical and engineering entrance examinations
 kashmiri andaaj main sir dhake in chaatraon ke samooh kota ke kuch koching institutes main aapako najar aa jaaenge, jinaki boli se yah andaaj lagaana mushki l nahin hota ki vah kis rajya se aati hai
 "my brother and sister are also studying engineering," says Sabra Parveen, 17, of Anantnag, a student studying at Kota's Allen Career Coaching Institutes
 main kota isliye ai taaki medical pravesh pariksha kii taiyaari ke liye kota ke koching institutes main padhai karun or phir medical kalege main daakhila lekar doctor ban sakuun
 "along with Sabra, his same friend Sabia Sharif too has taken admission four months ago
 ve srinagar kii hai
 In the litigation, Sabia dismisses the tighter attitudes about girl education
 unheen ke shabdon main, ''darasal kashmir main medical or ejineering kii pravesh parikshaon ke liye kota kii tarah shaikshanik compitishan kaa profeshnal maahaul nahin he
 This was the reason, due to which i decided to come to Kota
 lekin vaadi main ladakiyon kii talim ko lekar kisi tarah kaa virodh ho, aisi koi baat nahin
 "the information about the coaching institutes of Kota came from relatives or acquaintances of the people who read it here
" kota aakar koching kar rahi in chaatraon main apni padhai or makasad ko lekar koi uhapoh yaa jhijak nahin he
 Listen to Rukaiya Amin, a resident of Kulgam, "I want to enroll in a renowned medical college like All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) outside Jammu and Kashmir and my dream can be fulfilled only by coaching in Kota
" 
 isiilie main yahaan ai hum
 Rukaiya's father, Dr
 mohammad amin dental sarjan hai
 She herself wants to become a cardiologist
 aisa nahin ki oonchi padhai padhakar kashmir kii sari chatraayen rajya se baahar hi nikal janaa chaahati hai
 Take the opposite age of Kupwara
 unke bhi pita doctor hai or ve ginocolgist yani prasuti rog visheshgy banakar kashmir kii mahilaon kii seva karnaa chaahati hai
 Any special reason? "actually, there is a shortage of gynecologists in the plaintiff
 '' nek iraadon vaali ulfat to yahaan tak kahati hai ki ve doctor banane ke baad kashmiri logon ko muft swasthya seva muhaiyaa karaayengi
 "I will sit in Jammu and Kashmir's Common Entrance Test (CET) for admission to Medical College," said Ulfat
 ''chaatraon ke alaava kashmir se badi sankhya main chaatr bhi kota aa rahe hai
 Raza Riyaz, who comes from Anantnag, says that Wadi has coaching facilities for preparing for state level competitive examinations, but since he had to take coaching for national level exams, he made up his mind to come to Kota
 ghati main aatankwaad ko lekar tamaam tarah kii baton ke sandarbh main riyaj kehete hai, ''puri ghati ko aatankwaad ke nazariye se dekhnaa thik nahin
 It is usually confined to remote areas
 shaharon main iskaa utana asar nahin he
 "this year, around 185 students from the Valley have enrolled in the Allen Career Coaching Institute alone
 institute ke nideshak naveen maheshwari ise ek ahm ghatnakram bataate hai
 In his words, "so the process of coaching students from Kashmir's quota started 5-6 years ago, but then only a few students used to come
 2011-12 ke shaikshanik satr main pehali dfa vahaan se 121 chaatr-chatraayen aae
 We also had 195 students enrolled here last year
 is saal yah aankada pichhali baar kii sankhya ko paar kar jayega kyonki abhi to admician chal hi rahe hai
 The urge for higher education has arisen among Kashmiri students
 ''duusare institutes bhi maheshwari kii baton kii kamobesh pushti kar rahe hai
 In the opinion of Manoj Sharma, Vice President (business Development and Operations), Resonance Institute Institutes, students from the Valley are looking for opportunities beyond Jammu and Kashmir
 '' sharma yahaan ek or bade pahalu kii ore ishaara karte hai
 They believe that the big credit for this attitude changed in the litigants towards education, and the parents of these students and students who come to Kota coaching
 yah unheen kaa faisla tha
 They knew that this one decision could change their children's lives
 in chaatr-chaatraon ke liye samasyaayein bhi hai
 They come from the extremely cold and different geographical surroundings of the plaintiff
 amuman barf se ghiri vaadiyon main rahane vaale in yuvaaon ko kota main may-june main 45 degree se bhi zyada kaa taapmaana bardaasht karnaa padaa
 In such a situation, even the distance of a few steps from hostels to coaching institutes seems extremely exasperating to them
 lekin phir bhi in logon ne vipareet halaat main bhi khud ko dhaal liya he
 Sabia says that most of the girls usually stay in airconditioned or cooler rooms in hostels
 hostel se institutes tak kii duuri ve apane chehron ko kapade se dhak kar tay karti hai
 These students, who are addicted to non-vegetarian food, have to work with the vegetarian food of Rajasthan
 hostel ke mess main maansaahaari khaanaa nahin parosa jaataa
 Rukaiya says, "coming to Kota, gatta vegetable, kadhi, tinda and gourd and poha is a brand new meal
 isse talmail bithaane main hamen mushkilen aa rahi hai lekin dhire-dhire ham iske abhyast ho jaaenge
 "mostly, the students come from minority communities, who also study and pray together
" abhi khatm hue ramajaan ke maheene main chaatr-chatraayen koching main jaakar padhai to kar hi rahe hai, saath-saath roje bhi rakh rahe hai or tilavat bhi kar rahe hai
 It is a pity of grief that because of their being far away from home, they cannot even go home quickly
 ramajaan ke maheene main is tarah se ghar-parivaar se dur rahane kaa dard or bhi bad jaataa he
 By the way, leave aside the talk of food and other geographical problems, these Kashmiri students are also greatly affected by the sense of belonging to the people of Kota
 sabara to kahati bhi hai, ''koching institutes, hostel or mess main milane vaale kota ke or duusari jagahon ke sahpaathiyon se kaaphi apnaapan mila he
 Everyone is always ready to help
 ''gauratlab he ki kota main medical or ejineering pravesh parikshaon kii taiyaari ke liye har saal ek lakh se bhi zyada chaatr-chatraayen desh ke alag-alag hisson or videshon se bhi yahaan aate hai
 In comparison to this large number, the number of people coming from Kashmir may be just three digits, but no experts are considering it as a big initiative from the people of the plaintiff
 yah kashmir ghati ke badalte maahaul kaa sanket bhi ho saktaa he

 yadi jaruri hota he to ham apane sahyogiyon or saathiyon ke saath milakar rus kii gatividhiyon par charchaa bhi lagaate hai
