 Donovan Livingston - This is the name of a Harvard graduate whose speech was so inspiring and unique that he has been seen on youtube more than a million times since May 25
 donoven ne apane bhaashan ko kavita ke rup main sunaaya jiskaa sheershak 'lift Off' yani udaan bharna he
 In this poem, Donovan has interestingly addressed issues such as the role of education in the past, the meaning of education for african-americans, and what path academics should take in the future
 tippaniyan Read from this poem by Donovan, there are some lines that will not only make you think but will also inspire you to move forward - meraa ateet mujhe shant baithne nahin detaa
 Like my mind, my body also cannot stand in one place
 shikshak hone ke naate, awaz uthaane se behatar he, hamen in bandhanon se mukt karo, is bandhan ko tod daalo, hamen azaad karobhitar se ham main se koi bhi saamaanya nahin he, ham sabhi dhoomaketu kii tarah paidaa hue hai jo antariksh or samay main chakkar laga rahe hai or ham jahaan bhi takaraayenge apni chhap chodenge
 The mouth of the volcano reminds us that something amazing happened here
 kuch aisa jisane puri duniya ko hi badal diya tha
 It is an injustice to tell someone that education is the key to solving every problem, when you repeatedly change the lock of that key
 to uthie, jaagiye!! apni awaz uthaaie
 Until you fill the hole in the sky of every child's part
 main apni class kaa blike hole hum jo sab kuch apane andar samete ja rahaa tha lekin khud mere paas roshni kaa koi suraakh nahin tha
 But not anymore, now i am also a part of the stars
 nahin
 
 aasmaan ke aage bhi bahut kuch he
 The sky is just the beginning, so get up and fly !! donoven kii kahi is kavita main se padhie unki kahi kuch aisi line he jo na sirf aapako sochane ke liye majaboor karengi balki aapako aage badhane ke liye prerit bhi karengin - My past does not let me sit still
 mere dimag kii tarah meraa sharir bhi ek jagah nahin tik saktaa
 As a teacher, it is better to raise our voice, free us from these shackles, break this bond, set us free, none of us is normal from within, we are all born like comets who are born in space and time
 i am circling and we will leave our mark wherever we bump
 jwalamukhi kaa munh hamen yaad dilaataa he ki yahaan kuch kamaal kaa hua tha
 Something that changed the whole world
 kisi ko yah bataanaa anyaay he ki shiksha hi har uljhan ko sulajhane kii chaabi he, jabaki aap baar baar us chaabi kaa taala badal dete hai
 So wake up, wake up !! Raise your voice tab tak jab tak aap har bachche ke hisse ke aasmaan main hue chhed ko bhar nahin dete
 i am the black hole of my class, which was covering everything inside me, but i myself had no hole of light
 lekin ab or nahin, ab main bhi sitaron kaa hissaa hum
 No
 
 There is much beyond the sky
 aasmaan to bas ek shuruuaat he to utho or udaan baro!! Read from this poem by Donovan, there are some lines that will not only make you think but will also inspire you to move forward - meraa ateet mujhe shant baithne nahin detaa
 Like my mind, my body also cannot stand in one place
 shikshak hone ke naate, awaz uthaane se behatar he, hamen in bandhanon se mukt karo, is bandhan ko tod daalo, hamen azaad karobhitar se ham main se koi bhi saamaanya nahin he, ham sabhi dhoomaketu kii tarah paidaa hue hai jo antariksh or samay main chakkar laga rahe hai or ham jahaan bhi takaraayenge apni chhap chodenge

 aasmaan ke aage bhi bahut kuch he
 The sky is just the beginning, so get up and fly !! modi do sarkaar aate hi bhaajapa ne pehla kaam rajyasabha ko saadhane kaa kiya tha
 The courage of the BJP, which introduced the bill in Jammu and Kashmir by neutralizing Article 370 in the Rajya Sabha, was based on the fact that the dominance of the opposition camp was not the same in the Rajya Sabha
 lekin maharashtra prakaran ke baad rajyasabha kii raah, sattadhari dal ke liye pehle jaisi aasaan nahin rahi
 The current strength of the 245-member Rajya Sabha is 238 as 7 posts are still vacant
 kisi bhi vidheyak ko paas karaane ke liye bhaajapa ko 120 sadasyon kii jarurat he
 The party has 81 mps of its own
 iske alaava sahyogi dalon jediu, akali dal, lojpa or nominated sadasyon ko mila den to bhaajapa 103 kii sankhya tak pahunchati he
 This means that to support 17 other members, it will have to take the support of 7 of BJD, 11 of AIADMK, 6 of TRS, 4 of BSP, 2 of YSRC Congress
 lekin ye sabhi dal bhaajapa ke swabhaavik sahyogi nahin he
 Nor is it that these parties are united against the opposition (congress)
 ye sabhi dal apni vichaardhaara or jaruraton ke mutabik kisi bhi kheme main ja sakate hai
 The opposition camp is also not weak
 vipaksh ke paas is vakt 97 saansad hai
 In such a situation, the number of Rajya Sabha members is not comfortable for the BJP
 vidheyak par charchaa ke dauraan samarthan kisi bhi ore ja saktaa he
 Especially the government may have to bend in front of the demand to send the Select Committee instead of passing the Bill
 amuman vipakshi dal vidheyak ko latakaane ke liye unhe salect cameti main bhejne kaa aagrah karte hai
 Most parties, other than the government or constituent parties, insist on sending the bill to the Select Committee

 Such payments will have to be made by the common people, so they will not need to get a TAN number and they will have to deduct this TDS once for the whole year
 iske alaava is bajet main yah bhi tay kiya gaya he koi bhi vyakti ek din main teen lakh rupee zyada kaa cash tranjaction nahin kar sakegaa
 In this way, while purchasing vehicles, houses, jewelry and other valuables, you will have to pay by online payment or check, which will be in the eyes of the Income Tax Department and the scope of tax evasion is limited

 hamaari librari pehle se bhari rahati he
 
 
 There is also no place for the boys to sit
 
 
 " After the uproar over Shah's statement, Union Education Minister Smriti Irani has summoned a report on the case
 mantralay ne kulapati ko khat likhakar kaha he ki kuch mahilaon ko librari se baahar rakhana 'maanavadhikaar ulanghan' he
 Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani termed the vice-chancellor's statement as 'insulting daughters' and said that as a woman, this statement not only hurts but also agitates

 While clarifying the issue, Lt Gen Zameeruddin Shah, Vice Chancellor, said on Tuesday, "there are about 4,000 girls, who are studying in the undergraduate course"
 
 
 agar ham unhen bheetar aane jete hai, to jagah hi nahin bachegi
 
 
 So the point is, we cannot allow them
 
 
 vaise, ham mahila shashaktikaran ke khilaaf nahin hai
 
 
 " mahila college kii sthapana varsh 1906 main hui thi, or moulana azaad librari kai dashak baad sthapit hui
 Female college students were never given membership of this library, and although this library has a total seating capacity of 1,300 people
 chatraayen is baat ko lekar kaaphi pareshaan or gusse main hai

 At the same time, her husband Danish Ashraf was posted here as an IAS officer
 vah jab ilaake main ghoomane nikaleen to dekha ki jile main pehle se teen skool to chal rahe the lekin vahaan staff kam tha
 This was affecting the results of the children studying here
 Your story main chhapi ek report ke mutabik ruhi ko yahaan ke skulon ko dekhakar khyaal aayaa ki unhen ab ejineering kii ajukeshan kaa sahi istemaal karnaa chahie
 Ruhi says that i only thought of teaching those children
 Your story se ruhi ne kaha ki unhone Daporijo sthit Government Higher Secondary School main 12veen main Physics padhaane kaa nirnay liya
 Daporijo is the district headquarters here where children were finding it very difficult due to the absence of a physics teacher for five years

 As a result of this, in March 2019, 80 per cent students passed in Physics

 According to the demographic report published in Digital India, Upper Subansiri is down 64 percent in literacy
 iske peeche mukhya vajah yahaan ke skulon main sansadhano or khaskar teaching staff kii kami he
 Ruhi came out at such a time with the responsibility of these students
 pehle thodaa nervas thiruhi bataati hai ki jab unhone padhaane kii shuruyaat kii, tab shuru main vah nervas thim
 He also had no experience in teaching
 yahi nahin unhen stage par bolne se bhi hichak thi
 It was from here that i decided to conquer all my fears and thought of teaching children anyhow
 yahaan ke bachche lambey samay se fijics teacher na hone se is vishay main kaaphi kamjor the, iske liye bacchon ne apni taraf se prayaas kiye, saath hi ruhi ne bhi extra class lekar bacchon ko padhaayaa
 Used to come to Delhi and download videos, there was always a desire to learn something new in these children
 iske liye ruhi ne ekadam aage badhkar bacchon par teaching kaa new methd apanaaya
 Now she started teaching children with a projector, as well as adding a fun element to lighten the way of studying
 masalan gravitation or momentum samajhane ke liye vah superhiro kii filmein dikhaakar samajhaati thim
 It was not easy enough for Ruhi
 vah bataati hai ki vahaan pahari ilaake main network kii problem rahati thi
 For this she used to come to her hometown Delhi and download videos and show them to the children
 kaise hui shuruaataruhi ke pati danish ashraf kii tainaati Upper Subansiri jile main dipti kamishnar ke taur par 2016 main hui thi
 He said that some students had demanded for him a Physics teacher in his school
 vah kehete hai ki jab pehali baar bachche unke paas aae to mere man main aayaa ki main ruhi se puuchhuunga ki kya vah padhaane ko taiyaar hogi
 As soon as i asked Ruhi she immediately agreed
 danish kehete hai ki mujhe meri patni par garv he

 6 lakh crore) is an amount of Rs
 indian express ne sutron ke hawaale se kaha he ki centre sarkaar rigerv bank ke paas padi isrijrv mudra kaa lagbhag ek-tihaai hissaa lenaa chaahati he

 Shiv Sena, an alliance partner of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Center, has challenged the BJP, saying that it should prove Yashwant Sinha's comments on the state of the country's economy by falsifying it
 yashavanth sinha ne buudhvaar ko desh kii arthvyavastha ko lekar apni hi sarkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai thi, jiske baad desh kii siyasat main bhuuchaal aa gaya he
 The Shiv Sena said in the editorial that "we had said these things a year ago and the BJP had declared us as traitors
" ab yashavanth sinha kii baari he
 "the Shiv Sena stated in editorials published in its mouthpieces 'saamana' and 'noon Ka Saamna' that when former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Finance Minister P
K
 chidambaram jaise arthshaastri kah rahe the ki to unhen pagal kaha gaya or jab shivasena or anya ne sarkaar kii nitiyon par sawaal khadey kiye to unhen deshadrohi kaha gaya
 According to Yashwant Sinha's attack on the government-like demonetisation oil in the fire of falling GDP, according to the editorial, "former BJP finance minister Yashwant Sinha has blown out these false ideas, he has given many statements and now you give evidence Prove them wrong " sampadakeey main hawala diya gaya ki rus ke taanashaah joseph stallin ke shashan main unki sarkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane waalon ko raaton raat gaayab kar diya gaya yaa unhen yaatnagrih shiviron main bhej diya gaya
 The Shiv Sena said, "sinha has spoken the truth
 unhone kai muddon par roshni daali he, jinhone tabaahi machaai he
 It also includes demonetisation and the current state of the country's economy
 hamane yah dekhnaa he ki unhen kya sajaa milegi
 "modi's 'superman' Jaitley's attack on 'atal's Finance Minister', former Prime Minister of Atal Bihari Vajpayee on these 10 issues made Yashwant Sinha the country's Finance Minister and his views were easily received by the campaigners on social media networks" Can not be dismissed

 The Shiv Sena said, "it is being said in Gujarat that 'development has become messy'
" sinha ne sarkaar ke un khokhale daavon ko benakaab kar diya he, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki aadhikarik aankadon ke mutabik, desh kii jidipi dar 5
 7 per cent but actually 3
 7 fisadi he
 When Manmohan Singh and Chidambaram of the Congress had said the same things, the BJP called them insane
 "modi ke 'superman' jetali par 'atal ke vitt mantri' kaa atake, in 10 muddon par gheraasampadakeey main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke un bayanon par bhi prakaash daalaa gaya, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki kis tarah kuch log vikaas kaa bakhaan karte hai lekin kuch log abhi bhi is bhram he ki yadi ve iviem main chhedchhad kar chunaav jeet gaye to yah vikaas he
 Shiv Sena has mentioned in the article the statements of Yashwant Sinha, questioning many big claims of the government about the economy, how demonetisation has brought down the economy of the country, production has fallen, inflation has increased, gas, diesel and petrol The huge increase in prices, job cuts, sharp drop in investment, deterioration in the banking sector

 kangana ke piaar manager ne bataaya, 'aisi khabaren afvaah bhar hai, jisamen unki modi se mulaaqaat or raajnneeti jwine karne kaa zikr hai

 Former India intelligence agency RAW chief AS Daulat has said that Syed Salahuddin, the head of the banned Hizbul Mujahideen, still wants to return to India
 unhone khed prakat kiya ki sarkaar ne uski vaapasi kii yojana kaa khaakaa taiyaar karne main kaaphi samay ganvaa diya
 In his book titled Kashmir: The Vajpayee Years, Daulat wrote, In 2001 Salahuddin was ready to return and i advocated it hundreds of times
 sambhavat: mere baad ke ro pramukh vikram sood ke anya hit the or unke logon ne sochaa ki chunki main saamaanya taur par kashmir kaa maamla pradhanmantri karyaalay se dekhtaa tha, isliye unka is maamle main shaamil hona jaruri nahin he

 The work was completed and Salahuddin called again to thank Singh
 unhone apni pustak main likhaa, aise kathanon par kaam hona chahie, lekin durbhaagya se hamane kabhi aisa nahin kiya
 We could bring Salahuddin back, he was ready, but the point was when to bring him

 Maybe we lost a lot of time
 kashmir : da vaajapeyi ears naamak apni pustak main daulat ne likhaa, 2001 main salahuddin waapas lautne ko taiyaar tha or maine saikadon baar isaki vakaalat kii
 Probably my later RAW chief Vikram Sood had other interests and his people thought that since i normally handled the Kashmir issue from the Prime Minister's Office, it is not necessary for him to be involved in the matter
 tippaniyan Daulat also introduced the incident in the book in which KM Singh, the head of the Intelligence Bureau at Srinagar, received a call from Salahuddin seeking help to get his son admitted to the medical college
 yah kaam puraa hua or salahuddin ne singh ko dhanyavad dene ke liye phir phone kiya tha
 He wrote in his book, there should be work on such statements, but unfortunately we never did that
 ham salahuddin ko waapas laa sakate the, vah taiyaar tha, lekin baat yah thi ki use kab laayaa jaae
 Time was an important issue
 shaayad hamane kaaphi samay gavaan diya

 On the other hand corrupt people are active under their noses

 The Bihar from which Mr
 Natwarlal once emerged
 maujuuda bihar se nikle saare lallantop ke is baap ne to natvarlaal kii bhi kahani feeki kar di
 What game did he play ji haa
 The matter is that of the principal of that college in Bihar, Bachra Rai, who used to top the Lallans studying here
 ab jo nayaa khulaasa hua he wo ye kibaccha raay kii betiis saal bina barahavin ke imtehaan main baithe hi puure bihar main science main top kar gai
 And Saurabh Shrestha, who was considered to be the science topper till now, turned out to be a poor second topper
 ise kehete hai lallantop kaa baap
 The father of the entire education system of Bihar! sirf apni ladli beti kaa nahin
 Father of scams
 jaalsaji kaa baap
 Father of fraud bihar kii puri shiksha pranali kaa baap
 Father of Imtehan of tenth and twelfth and father of all Lallantop of Bihar
 kya aapane kabhi suna he ki kisi imtehaan main koi top kare or ustopper ko jamaane se chupa diyajae? ankhen khol dene or dimag ghuma dene vaale dastavej hai ye
 That too of Bihar Police
 ji haa
 This is a copy of the FIR
 or is copy main sabase upar ye naam likhaa he
 Shalini Rai
 role number 33014 / 10106
 First place in Inter Science
 yani science topper
 The FIR made to such a daughter is a blatant slap on the education system of Bihar
 ye exiaar is baat kaa bhi saboot he ki baccha raay jaise log kaise bihar shiksha board ke baap bane hue hai
 This father is amazing
 do saal pehle beti ko dasvin ke imtehaan main puure bihar main top karaayaa or ab barahavin main bhi beti topper number van bana diya
 It would have been proud if this baby girl Shalini would have topped herself
 puraa bihar beti ke saath-saath tab is baap par fakhr karata
 But the father turned out to be so amazing that he not only got the daughter's copy changed, but also did not let anyone feel that his daughter had topped science
 balki uski jagah is duusare lallan ko science kaa topper bana kar apni beti ke nattejey ko chupa liya
 It is clearly written in the FIR that the copy number of Bachchan Rai's daughter Shalini Rai was torn off and the second number was replaced instead
 police ne shuru kii chhapemariis taaja khulaase ke baad jaahir he do saal puraani ye tasviir bhi ab achaanak behad ahm ho gai he
 This is a picture from two years ago when Shalini Rai topped the tenth
 tab sachmuch puure bihar ko yahi laga tha ki baap ho to baccha raay jaisaa or beti ho to shalini jaisi
 But now after two years, i came to know that this is really the father of Lallantop
 par philhal baap faraar he
 Now obviously when the father is absconding, where will the children be found? wo bhi gaayab ho gaye
 On the other hand, as soon as the police started the process of registering an FIR, Imtehan and the chairman of the Bihar Education Board responsible for the results also resigned in a hurry
 rubi ko board ne diya 11 june tak kaa vakt'aaj tak' ne lalalntop kaa bhanda kya phoda bihar main hadakamp much gaya
 As soon as Nitish Kumar made a special investigative team of the police to investigate the scam as promised, all the llanuts disappeared
 dhunde nahin mil rahe ab
 Four students have been nominated to top the SIT FIR in a wrong manner
 inamen shalini raay ke alaava, saurabh, rahul kumaar or rubi raay kaa naam he
 After the topper Shalini, the science topper in the FIR, it is said of Topper number two, Saurabh, that there was a difference of ground-sky between his qualification and his copy
 saurabh isliye top kiya kyonki yaa to uski copy badali gai yaa phir koi or gadabadi hui
 The same has been said about Science Topper 3 Rahul Kumar, that the qualification is not even of third grade but the name was in the topper list
 arts kii topper rubi raay to pole khulne ke dar se visheshgyon ke saamne aane kii himmat hi nahin juta saki he
 The FIR states that Ruby will be awaited till June 11
 agar wo 11 june ko bihara pariksha board kii cameti ke saamne test dene aati he to thik varna police apni karrwai karegi
 In an FIR done to benefit the college, it is written in the FIR that the copies of the college of Vishundev Rai College from where the first three toppers of science i
e
 Shalini, Saurabh and Rahul and Arts topper Ruby Rai have come out were to be evaluated in Bhabhua and Ara district
 
 vishun raay college vaishali jile main aata he or is jile ke saare college kepariksha kendron kaa moolyankaninhin do jagahon par hua
 But Vishunarai College alone was one whose copies were tested at Patna's Rajendra Balak High School
 exiaar ke mutabik aisa vishunpaay college ko phayda pahunchane ke liye kiya gaya
 Along with registering the FIR, the SIT team is continuously conducting raids at different places
 team vishun raay college bhi pahunchi
 Also raided the school in Patna where copies of this college were tested
 chaape ke baad skool kii principal ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Apart from this, two school clerks have also been arrested
 jabaki ek chaparasi ko hiraasat main liya gaya he
 There are no isolated people who sell even a unique record in the name of Bacha Rai till the result of the 11th puraa kaa puraa ek giroh he iske peeche
 But if anyone can expose every person of this gang, then he is the principal of the highest Laltopat college ie Bachchan Rai
 bas is ek shaks ne agar sach ugal diya yaa isse sach ugalva liya gaya to yakeen maniye bihar ke lallan ke top banane kaa sara khel aam ho jayega
 His name is Bachchan
 or pahchaan he lallanon ko top karana
 This record may never come on the record, but Bachchan Rai has a unique record
 jis umr main bachche amuman college main daakhila lene jate hai us umr main hi ye usee vishuneray intermediat college ke principal ban gaye the jo aaj toppers ugalane kii factory ban gai he
 Became at the age of 19, Prisimplebacha Rai passed the examination of tenth in 1994
 magar iske baad khud inhen barahavin kaa imtehaan paas karne main or chaar saal lag gaye
 Actually, he failed twice in the 11th century
 phir teesri baar 1998 main inhone apane pita ke isi vishuneray kalej se imtehaan diya or first divijan se paas kar gaye
 He suddenly became the principal of the same college in 1999, the next year after passing the exam of XII
 tab inaki umr sirf 19 saal thi
 Then after becoming the principal, he showed such magic that this school became the mine to get the topper
 yahaan daakhile kaa matlab hi tha topper nahin to distinkashan number ke saath varanaa first divijan se paas kii to guarantee he hi
 In 2007, the case of disturbances at Namis College was first reported for the first time
 tab achaanak yahaan ke chaatro kaa rigelt puure bihar ko aainaa dikhaane laga tha
 Since then, the college has never looked back
 do saal pehle tak topper banane kaa college kaa tarika bada sidhaa-sada sa tha
 During the examination itself, students were copied and topped at the examination centers
 iske liye yaa to jawaab pehle se taiyaar hote the yaa phir koi scollar chaatro ko jawaab likhaata tha
 Many students did not even have to go to the examination center
 unki jagah unheen ke naam se doosraa scollar kapi likh aata tha
 The RJD leader from the education mafia, even two years ago, when the administration started a campaign to crack down on emulation, Bachara Rai changed his course
 tab tak vaise bhi wo shiksha mafia se argedy kaa netaa bhi ban gaya tha
 He now had access to the Bihar Examination Board
 lihaaja ab wo imtehaan ke baad kapiyaan badalawaane ke khel main bhi maahir ho gaya
 Obviously, Bachchan Rai cannot be the sole responsible for this entire scam
 uske peeche bhi log hai
 Those ranging from government to examination board
 bas dekhnaa ye he ki un sabake girebaan par nitish sarkaar kaa haath kab tak pahunchataa he
 Or even reaches? jharkhand ke palamu jile main siarpief or police ke sanyukt abhiyaan main 12 sandigdh maovadiyon ko maar giraaya gaya he

 The Election Commission on Thursday announced the date for the assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh
 pradesh main chunaav keval ek charan main honge
 The people of Himachal will vote on 9 November and the counting of votes will take place on 18 December
 aise main sawaal yah uthta he ki aakhir himachal pradesh main chunaav ke taarikh ke elaan ke saath hi bihar sarkaar ke ek mantri kii dhadkan kyon bad gai he ? aakhir kya he himachal pradesh ke chunaav kaa bihar conection ?to jaan lijie kya he himachal pradesh ke chunaav kaa bihar conection he

 mangal pandey nitish kumaar sarkaar main swasthya mantri banane se pehle se hi himachal pradesh main bhaajapa ke prabharee hai
 Mangal Pandey was the President of Bihar BJP before assuming the responsibility of Himachal in the month of May this year and after the completion of his term he was given the new responsibility of Himachal
 yani mangal pandey ek saath do jimmedaariyaan nibhaa rahe hai, bihar main swasthya mantri or himachal main bhaajapa ke prabharee
 In such a situation, if we see Mangal Pandey's performance as incharge in Himachal Pradesh, it can be said that BJP can be bat in the assembly elections as well
 aisa isliye kyonki himachal ke prabharee banane ke 1 maheene baad june main pradesh memnagar nigamake chunaav hue jisamen bhaajapa ko 34 main se 17 siton par apana kabja jamaaya
 The BJP returned to power in Himachal Pradesh after 31 years in the municipal elections under the leadership of Mangal Pandey

 With the announcement of election date in Himachal, it has been decided that Health Minister Mangal Pandey will be seen less in Bihar and more in Himachal for the next few days
 himachal pradesh main vidhansabha kii kul 68 siten hai or bhaajapa kaa mukhya muqabla vahaan har seat parcongress sehoga

 On the first day of the fourth Test match of the series against England, the visiting Indian team in Manchester equaled an embarrassing World Record which no team would ever want to do
 is pari main chah bhartiya ballebaaj bina khaataa khole out hue, or test cricket ke itihaas main isse pehle yah sirf teen baar hua he
 First, it was a disappointing performance by India's arch-rivals Pakistan in the first innings of the Test that began in Karachi on December 22, 1980, when they were playing against the West Indies, although the match was a draw
 iske baad kisi team ke chah khilaadiyon ko shunya par out kar daalane kaa karnama bhartiya gendbaajon ne ahmedabad main kiya tha, jab 20 november, 1996 ko shuru hue test kii chauthi pari main mehmaan dakshin africa ke ballebaaj unki gendon ko katai nahin samaj paae, or match haar gaye
 For the third time, six Bangladesh batsmen were dismissed for zero in a match that began in Dhaka on 8 December 2002, and the match was won by the West Indies
 so, ab ek pari main sabase adhik ballebaajon ke shunya par out hone kaa record pakistan, dakshin africa, bangladesh or bharat ke naam par sanyukt rup se darj ho gaya he
 In the Manchester Test, the Indian team's Murali Vijay, Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Pankaj Singh were unable to open the account, while Gautam Gambhir (4 runs) and Varun Aaron (1 not out) also scored in double digits
 Could not reach bharat kii ore se keval captain mahendra singh dhoni (71), ajinkya rahane (24) or ravichandran aswin (40) hi tikkar khel paae
 Earlier, maximum five batsmen of Indian team were dismissed for zero in a single innings, and this is done by Team India three times
 pehali baar team india ke paanch ballebaajon ko shunya par 23 janvari, 1948 ko edilade main shuru hue test match kii teesri pari main australia ke gendbaajon ne out kiya tha, or bharat vah match haar gaya tha
 For the second time in the third innings of the match which started in Leeds on 5 June 1952, England bowlers returned five Indian batsmen to the pavilion without opening an account, and Team India lost that match too
 bhartiya team kaa aisa sharmnaak pradarshan isse pehle aakhri baar 10 oktober, 1999 ko mohali main shuru hue match main dekha gaya tha, jab mehmaan newzealand ke gendbaajon ne match kii pehali hi pari main paanch bhartiya khilaadiyon ko shunya par out kar daalaa tha, haalanki bharat vah match drow karwaane main kaamyaab rahaa tha
 Former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief KS Sudarshan termed the 'clarification' of the top Bharatiya Janata Party leader LK Advani on the Jinnah case as satisfactory
 iske saath hi, unhone pakistan ke sansthaapak mohammad ali jinna par sangh parivaar main chal rahi bahes ko or garm karte hue kaha he ki jinna kabhi raashtra (avibhajit bharat) ke liye puri tarah samarpit the
 On the Jaswant case, Sudarshan, the former Union chief, declined to comment on Jaswant Singh's expulsion from the BJP over the Jinnah issue in an interaction with the media after an event in Indore
 unka kahana tha ki yah bhaajapa kaa aantarik maamla he lekin jab unhen yaad dilaayaa gaya ki unke sangh pramukh rahane ke dauraan adwani ke jinna ko dharmanirpeksh bataane par bhagava khemaa gusse se laal ho gaya tha, to unhone kaha ki adwani ne is sambandh main aage chalakar kai tarah ke spashtikaran de diye hai
 Anyway, the BJP has to decide everything in this regard
 hamen us samay jo kahana tha, hamane kah diya tha
 There have been many forms of Jinnah when asked that Sudarshan is still satisfied with Advani's explanation on the Jinnah episode, then his answer was 'absolutely'
 kya vah jinna ko dharmanirpeksh maanate hai
 On this question, he said that Jinnah has had many forms
 vah kabhi lokmaanya tilak ke saath the or purnat: raashtra ke prati samarpit the

 The rapid expansion of the Internet has made social platforms such as Facebook available for discussion
 yah utana hi sulabh, connective or dotarafa samvaad he, jitna ki hindi sahitya kii duniya band hoti thi
 Apparently its expression on social media is the modern pastime of youth
 tabhi to 2014 main bharat main fasebuk ke active yugers kii sankhya 10 karod paar kar gai
 After all, how did the publisher of Hindi reach this young Jamaat? How to captivate his heart and mood? Social media has also created his celebrity
 celebraties tak unke phans kii pahunch bhi aasaan kii he
 Perhaps Hindi publishers hope to add new readership to this path

 Now the beginning of the celebratory phase is being tried

 It is an easy road, but not sustainable
 nae pathakon ko lubhaane vaali he par prabhavi or achche kathy nahin
 The same linguistic feat, the same kind of narrative and sentiment, creates the same irritation in being a 'city in love'
 kitaab main chah khandon main laghu prem kathaayen hai

 fliover, bas, metro se shuru hota unka prem or unase judi samvednaaen dilli kaa feel karaati he
 As if Ravish is running in the map of Delhi, but it looks very mechanical
 lav exam nots ghumiphiri, uff!khand main college life ke prem prasang hai
 He takes the name from Khap, Ambedkar to Lakshmanpur Bathe somewhere, but why, fearing that the feel of Ravish's report may also be correct
 to jor laga ke jindagi main raveesh 2011 ke anna ke lokapal andolan main bhi premi jodon ko khoj lete hai
 The only feature of the book is that the author has tried to make love out of routine and common things
 puri kitaab main ek hi tarah kii panktiyaan, bhav or kathy bhare pade hai
 It seems as if we are reading the same thing again and again and it starts getting cold
 yah diary lekhan jaisaa he jo fasebuk se hote hue kitaab main aa gaye hai
 Perhaps it would have been better if it were limited to Facebook
 fasebuk main ripitesan kaa ahsaas nahin hota kyonki ham ek baar main ek yaa do-teen post hi pard rahe hote hai or pichley kaa bhav or kathy bhul chuke hote hai, lekin unhen ek saath kitaab kii shakl main padhanaa hi ripitesan or boriyat kii vajah he
 Ravish has a better role than Laprake in the book
 haa, vikram nayak kaa chitrankan behatar he
 Another aspect, the book was released in January at the Jaipur Literature Conference

 An external dialogue process will also have to be initiated
 ’’ mukhyamantri ne kaha ki koi yah daawa nahin kar rahaa he ki vaarta keval kashmir par kendrit honi chahie
 Apart from the Valley, the people of Jammu, Ladakh and Kargil should also be included in the resolution process and they and our neighbors (pakistan) will have to find a solution that is acceptable

 Dr
 mahesh sharma ne 2014 loksabhaa kaa chunaav record maton se jeeta tha
 He reached the Lok Sabha by defeating his nearest rival Narendra Bhati of SP by over 2 lakh 80 thousand votes
 haalanki, isse pehle 2009 loksabhaa chunaav main vah basapa ke surendra nagar se kareeb 16 hajaar vot se haar gaye the
 There are a total of 5 assembly seats in this region
 inamen noida, jevar, sikanderabad, dadri or khurja shaamil hai
 In the 2017 assembly elections held in Uttar Pradesh, all these five seats went to the account of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 2014 ke nattejeypichley loksabhaa chunaav main is seat par bhartiya janata party ne bade antar se jeet darj kii thi
 In 2014, Union Minister Mahesh Sharma won this seat with nearly three lakh votes
 mahesh sharma ne samaajawaadee party ke narendra bhaati ko maat di thi

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator The smile of the faces of Ram Vilas Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi was misleading after the BJP was somehow successful in seat-sharing
 unke bich khud ko bihar kaa sabase kaddavar dalit netaa dikhaane kii jang vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad bhi jari rahane vaali he
 Manjhi relented with Bemon when BJP President Amit Shah gave 20 seats to his Hindustan Awam Morcha (secular) as against 40 seats given to Paswan's LJP
 bijepi ne 160 siten apane liye rakhin or 23 siten upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party ke khate main gayi
 If Manjhi's immediate ambition is to punish Nitish Kumar for removing him from the cm's chair, then his long-time political rival is nine-time MP Paswan
 jab maanjhi ne jedy(you) choda, tab paswan endie main acchhee tarah sthapit ho chuke the
 Paswan came into the NDA alliance before the general election and contested seven seats, winning six seats and reaping a spectacular electoral harvest
 unhone kendriya mantrimandal main jagah bhi pakki kar lee
 But Manjhi's sudden emergence as a Dalit leader and then forging an alliance with the BJP was a major blow to Paswan's strength to negotiate as the only Dalit leader of the NDA
 isse bhi badtar yah ki maanjhi ko vidhansabha chunaav ke baad kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil karne kaa ishaara de diya gaya he
 If that happens, Manjhi will indeed stand up to Paswan's equals, while Paswan has demonstrated his ability to play a role in the state and center of politics for decades beyond his stature
 ek hi paale main rahakar ek duusare ko pachhadgaye kii is jang main bihar ke nattejey nirnaayak sabit honge
 Paswan has proved his credentials as a leader who can get outright votes of his supporters to the account of others
 udhar maanjhi ke kandhon par pehali hi chunavi aajamaaish main badi kathin chunauti aan padi he
 a few months ago in the South Delhi region, the District President of the Purvanchal front of the BJP was beaten up by some BJP leaders, goons on the road of South Delhi
 bijepi ke apane purvanchal morche ke jila adhyaksh ko wo peetate hai to aam purvanchal ke logon ke saath vah kya karte honge? hamane unke sammaan main uttar bhartiya swabhimaan yatra nikaali
 Which included 8500 motorbikes and several hundred cars
 iske alaava purvanchal se aae hamaare bhaaiyon jo dilli ke vikaas kii gati main barabari ke hissedaar hai unke khilaaf bhi bijepi ke logon ne atyaachaar kiya or unki ek purvanchal virdohi maansikta dikhi
 Apart from this, you saw in Gujarat and in Maharashtra where the BJP government is there and there was atrocities with the people of Purvanchal and there was an escape
 unhone kaha ki jab-jab ham ye kehete hai dilli waalon ko ham yahaan ke collejon main aarakshan denge
 
 
 We say one more thing in the same breath that we mean a Delhiite who votes in Delhi
 chaahe vah kahi ye bhi aayaa ho
 Have come from Bihar, come from UP, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand
 vah dilli main vot daalata he or vah dilli kaa matadaata he or pakkaa dilli vaala he
 Targeting BJP, Raghav Chadha said that if Modi and Amit Shah's pair came together modi-shah kii jodi satta main ai to na samvidhan bachegaa na desh bachegaa or na hi partiyaan bachengi
 For this we were ready to ally with Congress
 unhone kaha ki hamane to spashth kaha he ki koi bhi gaiyr bhaajapa sarkaar banati he
 If that is our election issue
 
 
 ham kah rahe hai ki hamen dilli ke purna rajya kaa darja chahie
 If a non-bjp government gives full statehood, then we will give full consideration to support it
 abhinayta salmaan khan ne unki film dekhne ke liye 18 kilometre paidal yaa cycle se yatra karne vaale ek prashansak ko shandaar bike uphaar main dene kaa faisla kiya he

 Addressing the Kisan Mahapanchayat here at the conclusion of his 70-km march on foot in Greater Noida and Aligarh district, Rahul dismissed criticism that he was doing the drama
 mayawati ne rahul gandhi ke march ko nautanki qaraar diya tha
 Using strong words against his rival, he said that a farmer in Uttar Pradesh comes to know about land acquisition when a builder comes and tells him that this land is now his (the builder's)
 rahul ke is raajnneetik abhiyaan ko agle saal uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaari ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Rahul said that in Uttar Pradesh, we are not against development or road construction but this land is being taken from farmers to build golf courses, colonies and racing tracks and that is why they are angry
 unhone kaha ki kisaan kahata he ki yadi lakhanu main kisi dhani vyakti kii jameen lee jaati he to use bazaar dar di jaati he lekin jab ek garib kisaan kii baari aati he tab usapar goliyaan daagi jaati hai, use peeta jaataa he or sarkaar hamase baat nahin karti

 Rejecting criticism about his campaign, Rahul said that many people believe that this is a drama but a politician needs to go to the people and talk to them and i believe in it
 bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kii ore ishaara karte hue rahul ne kaha ki kuch kisaanon ko is (kanoon ke) bare main chintaa he kyonki yah purana he or unhen (kisaanon ko) is baat se dikkat he
 He said, 'we will try to implement a law that will benefit the farmer but only by bringing the law will not benefit because already some laws exist in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh but where the Haryana government takes people in confidence and talks to them At the same time, the Uttar Pradesh government does not talk to the people
 jab koi kisaan apane adhikaron kii maang karata he, tab sarkaar usapar goliyaan chalaane kaa aadesh de detii he
 He said that after the movement in Bhatta Parsaul, Mayawati came up with a new policy on land acquisition, but that would not benefit the farmers affected there and that is why i started the padyatra
 unhone kaha ki do maheene pehle bhatta parsul main kisaanon ne virodh pradarshan shuru kiya tab police ne un par goliyaan chalaayin or kuch kisaan maare bhi gaye
 It is very sad that the farmers did not make any mistake, even after that bullets were fired on them
 rahul ne kaha ki kisaanon ne sarkaar se keval yahi kaha tha ki yadi vah unki jameen chaahati he, to vah unhen paryaapt muaavja de, lekin badale main police ne un par goliyaan chalaayin or unki pitayee kii

 ' Bihar's creation scam is continuously spreading its legs

 Actually, the pole of creation scam is open due to demonetisation

 The situation had changed so much that demonetisation took place in November last year that crores of rupees of creation got stuck there
 jisase paisa srijan sarkari khaaton main phir jamaa ho saken
 At the same time, many creditors refused to give money after the death of Manorama Devi, who was the creator of the creation
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki karodon ke farjivade main sarkari paise ko byaaj par bazaar main diya jaataa tha
 When the demonetisation happened, the transaction stopped because of the old note
 bainkon se paisa nikaalane or jamaa karne ke sakht niyam kii vajah se srijan kii qamar tut gai
 Neither the thousand and five hundred notes were going on in the market, nor the banks were getting huge deposits
 kaala dhan hone kii vajah se bainkon mensrujan kaa paisalot nahin paaya, is tarah sarkari paisa bainkon main laut nahin paaya or srijan kaa khel bigadataa gaya
 The government's check started bouncing
 jaanch ke mutabik sarkari paisa srijan ke khate main pahunch jaataa use bank se bhi byaaj miltaa or paisa bazaar main lagane se use vahaan se bhi byaaj miltaa yani do tarafa phayda srijan ko mil rahaa tha
 Most of the money for creation was spent in real estate, not only in Bihar, but in many states including delhi-ghaziabad-dehradun, money was invested in real estate, but demonetisation did not sell and the money was not returned

 From then on, his happiness and wellbeing have been the centre of anything @goldiebehl and i ever did
 And so, when the Big c reared its ugly head, our biggest dilemma was what and how we were going to tell him
 As much as we wanted to protect him, we knew it was important to tell him the full facts
 We've always been open and honest with him and this time it wasn't going to be different
 He took the news so maturely


 and instantly became a source of strength and positivity for me
 In some situations now, he even reverses roles and takes on being the parent, reminding me of things i need to do! i believe that it's imperative to keep kids involved in a situation like this
 They are a lot more resilient than we give them credit for
 It's important to spend time with them and include them, rather than make them wait on the side-lines, not being told yet instinctively knowing everything
 In our effort to protect them from the pain and realities of life, we might end up doing the opposite

 Whereas IIM professors took a dig at Ramesh, there was a fierce rhetoric on the issue between the BJP and the Congress

 He had said at a function on Monday, 'IIT hardly gets any important research

 IIM professors also termed Ramesh's comments as 'one-sided'
 prophessoron ne kaha ki ye tippaniyan atyadhik agyanta kaa nateeja hai
 Professor Anil Gupta of iim-ahmedabad said, 'it shows that Jairam Ramesh is quite ignorant about the intellectual capabilities of these institutions
 main is baat kaa khandan karata hum ki in sansthaanon ko kaaphi adhik prayaas karne kii jarurat he
 'another professor at IIM Ahmedabad, Sebastian Morris, said Ramesh's comments were' one-sided '
 unhone kaha, ‘agar aap gaur karen to paayenge ki im or iaiti ke kaaphi shikshakon ke paas utani hi shaikshanik yogyata or prishthbhumi he jitani sheersh sansthaanon ke shikshakon ke paas hai

 But do you know how badly this matter of childhood can affect the future of your child
 haal main hui ek study ke anusaar, 700 logon se jab unke bachapan ke bare main poocha gaya to unamem se kaiyon ne kaha ki bhautikwaad kaa gun unamem unke mata-pita se aayaa he
 These people were also asked about their childhood, their relationships with parents, childhood punishment and its type
 kai logon ne ye bhi kaha ki jab ve apane mata-pita ke kahe anusaar kaam karte the to unhen gift milte hai
 Many times parents used to give them gifts to make them happy
 maa-baap jab naaraaz hote the to in bacchon se unke tohfe chin liye jate the, jounaki sajaa hua karti thi
 Marsha Richins, a researcher, explains that childhood habits become so deep in children that they do not leave them even when they are older
 research ke anusaar, ati bhautikwaadi bacchon ko bade hokar shaadishuda jivan main sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 In them, the feeling of pleasing themselves becomes so much that for this they do not even refrain from gambling
 unhen lagata he ki jua khelkar wo zyada se zyada dhan praapt kar lenge or usase bhautik sukh kaa anand uthaaenge
 It has also been said in research that this habit of giving bribe has a very bad effect on the child
 bachche ko chizon or kaam kii kadra nahin rah jaati he, wo har cheez ko usee tarah dekhne lagata he aise main maa-baap ko chahie ki agar wo bachche ko khush karne ke liye kuch de rahe hai to use us cheez kii keemat kaa ehsaas bhi karaaen

 The CM of UP said that the question is not about the advantages or disadvantages in the elections, but it is a question of the faith of the countrymen
 congress is samasya kii jad main he or vah iskaa samaadhaan hone nahin dena chaahati he
 He said, if the Ayodhya dispute is settled and the ban on triple talaq is implemented then the politics of appeasement in the country will end forever
 unka kahana he ki tital kaa vivaad anaavashyak rup se jodakar ayodhya vivaad ko lanbaa khinchaa ja rahaa he
 We appeal to the Supreme Court to give justice at the earliest for the satisfaction of millions of people, so that it can become a symbol of public faith
 anaavashyak vilamb hone se sansthaanon se logon kaa bharosa uth jayega
 He said that as far as people's patience and trust is concerned, unnecessary delay is causing a crisis
 bataa den ki samachar agency eenai ke saath intervyuu main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha tha mandir mudde par sarkaar supreme court ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahi he

 But budget homes may not be successful in attracting new buyers (and their votes)
 girti keemton ke baavjood 2017 main gharon kii kharidari pichley saat saal ke nunatam str par pahunch chuki thi
 The sector, which had worsened due to demonetisation in the last days of 2016, was also shocked by the introduction of GST and Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA)
 2017 main nae project launch main 41 fisad kam ho gaya jabaki nae gharon kii bikri lagbhag 7 pratishat neeche gai
 Property consultant JLL India had reported in March 2018 that as of the end of 2017 there were a total of 4,40,000 unsold houses in seven major cities of the country with the largest share being delhi-ncr with over 1,50,000 flats
 kendriya bajet main kiye gaye upayon main se ek tha gharon kii bikri par hue laabh ko dderghaavadhi puunjigat laabh kar se mukt karnaa
 This exemption was earlier but only in the case when such benefit is used in the purchase of a new house (subject to section 54)
 ab puunjigat laabh par kar se chhot do karod kii seemaa tak do bhawanon kii kharid ke liye kar di gai he
 Experts say that this also will not help much
 sampatti salaahkaar form nite frank india ke kaaryakari nideshak gulam zia kaa kahana he ki is praavdhaan se log to utsahit honge lekin yah bazaar ko koi bada protsaahan dene vaali baat nahin he
 Investors have already left the market
 iske alaava is baat kii koi nischitata nahin he ki kam maang vaale maujuuda bazaar main niveshkon ko koi phayda hoga hi
 It is also difficult to expect that people with an income of less than five lakh rupees per annum will now get the benefit of tax exemption, they will buy houses
 sarkaar ne badi maatra main taiyaar ikaiyaan or sazosaman rakhane kii jarurat ke maddenjar realty developaron kii bhi kuch raahat di he
 It has increased the period of exemption from tax on unsold homes from the current one year to two years
 isse developaron ko badi raahat milane kii ummid he or ab ve apana dhyaan vikray ranneetiyon kii ore kendrit kar sakenge
 The government has extended the benefits under Section 80 (IBA) to March 31, 2020, with a view to encourage cheaper homes, but there is already a big question mark over the sale of houses under affordable housing schemes
 visheshgyon ke anusaar, saste awaas kii paribhaasha or aise inaki vaastavik bikri bahut aashwastakaari nahin he
 Shanti Dhariwal, Rajasthan's Urban Development and Housing Minister, says the budget will have little impact on real estate as those investing in second or third homes are not very concerned about the nominal tax
 unhone kaha ki rera ke kathor praavdhaanon main sanshodhan hona chahie jisase isse kshetra par padaa nakaaratmak prabhaav hate

 India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that Yuvraj Singh will make a mistake if he tries to become Saurabh Ganguly
 behatar hoga yuvaraj, yuvaraj hi rahen
 The return of Yuvraj to India's Test team has come as Sourav Ganguly said goodbye to international cricket
 punjab ke baayen haath ke visphotak ballebaaj yuvaraj singh ko 'maharaj' ke naam se femes saurabh ganguli ke vaaris ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Before the first cricket Test match against England starting here on Thursday, India's captain Dhoni said that it is better to be Yuvraj, Yuvraj
 yuvaraj yadi maharaj banane kii koshish karte hai, to yah unki sabase badi galati hogi
 It is better if the Crown Prince remains the same
 unhone kaha ki yuvaraj ek alag shakhsiyat hai, unki ranneeti auron se ekadam alag he or unke khilne kaa andaaj bhi alag he
 In such a situation, we want the Crown Prince to be the Crown Prince
 unhen apana mizaaj badalane kii jarurat nahin he
 In odis and T20 cricket, Yuvraj played a great game, but has failed to replicate his success in Test cricket
 dhoni ko yuvaraj par puraa bharosa he
 Dhoni said that right now Yuvraj is batting in full color
 unhen apni aisi hi rangath test match main dikhaani hogi
 At the same time, Yuvraj also bowling with left hand
 vah balle or gend donon se kaaphi kargar ho sakate hai
 Dhoni wants young leg-spinner Amit Mishra not to immediately try to be like India's greatest leg-spinner Anil Kumble
 dhoni ne amit mishra ke bare main bhi kaha ki yadi amit sochate hai ki vah anil kumble kii jagah le rahe hai, to vah khud ke liye pareshaani khadi kar rahe hai
 i want Amit Mishra to remain who he is
 dhoni ne kaha ki bhartiya team ko anbhavi leg spinner anil kumble kii kami khalegi, lekin yah kisi noujvaan khilaadi ke liye maukey se kam nahin he
 Pink Metro in Delhi has started its journey, touching the pinnacle of the metro network in Delhi
 dilli ke dhaulakuan ilaake main pink metro jahaan orport metro kii maujuuda line ko cross karti he, us jagah par metro sabase zyada oonchai se guzarati he
 On Wednesday, a metro train passed on this line before beginning the metro trial and this pink train became the first metro to travel at the highest altitude
 ye line metro kii pink line kaa hissaa he, jo majalis park-shiv vihaar ke bich daudegi
 Trial is going to start on the Pink Line of the metro, currently the trial will be between Mayapuri to South Campus, a train has been put on the track of this line to prepare for it, but currently the overhead electricity line is not energized here
 That means there was no electricity to run the train, so with the help of a diesel powered shutter, the metro was run on the track
 dilli metro ke pravaktaa ke mutabik dhaulakuan par pink line kii oonchai 23
 6 meters, which is the highest in the Delhi Metro's existing network
 iske pehle kadakadduma ke paas metro kii oonchai sabase zyada thi, jahaan 19 meter oonche brij se metro guzarati he
 The metro at Dhaulakuan will run at a height equal to a seven-story building
 itani oonchai par metro line kaa nirmaan ejineering ke lihaaz se bhi kaaphi chunauti bharaa tha, kyonki yahaan metro line ke neeche orport metro kii maujuuda line he, jo oparational bhi he or isi jagah par dhaulakuan kaa vyast fliover intersection bhi he
 The metro was constructed here between 12 o'clock in the morning to 4 o'clock in the morning, so that the operation of the airport line is also not affected and the road traffic of Dhaulakuan below is also ineffective
 philhal mayapuri or south campus metro stesan ke bich agle kuch dinon main trial kiya jayega
 Length of this part 6
 8 kilometre he
 Prior to this, trial has already started from Shakurpur to Mayapuri
 is dauraan metro ke rolling stock yani train coach or trek kaa test kiya ja rahaa he, saath hi overhead electricity line bhi test kii jaaegi
 The length of this entire line from Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar is 59 kilometers and this line will cover the ring road, it will be trialled in different parts
 pichley kaaphi lambey samay se kashmir or border par lagaataar tanaav kii sthiti rahi he
 Whether the action of the stone-pelters in the valley or the separatists inciting violence with the help of Pakistan, such incidents are constantly increasing
 is bich sena pramukh bipin ravat ne ghati main pathar barasaane waalon ko sidhi chunauti di he, unhone kaha ki ve log ham par pathar barasaane ke bajaay goliyaan chalaaye, taaki jo main karnaa chaahun wo kar sakuun
 In this interview given to news agency PTI, Bipin Rawat spoke openly about the situation of the stone-pelters and Kashmir
 padhein is intervyuu kii 10 badi baaten
 
 
 1) When people are throwing stones at us and throwing petrol bombs, i cannot ask my soldiers to just wait and die
 2)sena pramukh ne kashmiri yuvak ko jeep par baandh maanav dhaal kii upyog karne kii ghatana kaa bachaav kiya, unhone kaha ki kashmir main proxi war se nipatane ke liye sainikon ko naye tareeke apnaane padate he
 3) General Rawat said that people are throwing stones at us, throwing petrol bombs
 aise main jab mere karmi mujhase poochhate he ki ham kya karen to kya mujhe yah kahana chahie ki bas intjaar kariye or jaan de dijie? main rashtriya dhvaj ke saath ek acha taabut lekar aauungaa or sammaan ke saath shav ko aapke ghar bhejuungaa
 Should i say this as the chief? i have to keep the morale of the soldiers stationed there
 4)general ravat ne kaha ki vastav main main chahta hum ki ye log ham par patharav karne kii bajaay hathiyaar chalaaen, tab main khush hota
 Then i would do what i want to do
 5)jammu kashmir main lambey samaytak kaam kar chuke general ravat ne kaha ki kisi bhi desh main logon main sena kaa bhay khatm hone par desh kaa vinaash ho jaataa he
 He said that the opponents should be afraid of you and your people should also be afraid of you
 hamaari mitraapurna vyavhaar rakhane vaali sena hai lekin kanoon-vyavastha behaal karne se judaa sawaal aane par logon main hamaara bhay hona chahie
 6) He said that maximum restraint is introduced when dealing with any situation in the valley
 general ravat ne kaha ki sena pramukh ke rup main sena kaa manobal mere liye sabase jaruri he, vah meraa kaam he
 7) Army Chief said that only four districts of South Kashmir are disturbed and it is wrong to say that the situation in entire Kashmir has gone out of control
 kashmir mudde ke samaadhaan ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki iske thos samaadhaan kii jarurat he
 Everyone needs to join
 sena kii bhoomika yah sunishchit karnaa he ki hinsa naa ho or isamen hissaa nahin lene vaale aam logon kii raksha kii jaae
 8) When asked about political initiatives for contact with Kashmiri people, General Rawat said that it is for the government to decide
 unhone kaha ki purv main bhi aisi pahal kii ja chuki he
 9) In the context of Pakistan, the Army Chief said that he did not appear to be predictive of a limited war with Pakistan
 10)general ravat bole ki kashmir mudde ke thos hal kii jarurat he or har kisi ko isamen shaamil hona hoga
 There was anger across the country over the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua
 bacchon ko jis tarah kii hinsa kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, use dekhakar samaaj sadame main tha or aise aparaadhon ke khilaaf turant or thos kadam uthaane kii maang jor pakad rahi thi
 In such a situation, the government came out with an ordinance which also provides for the death penalty for rape of children
 lekin anubhav hamen aagaah kar rahaa he ki nrushans ghatnaayen agar kaarak banati hai to parinti kharaab kanoon main hoti he
 The idea behind the provision of capital punishment in the case of rape of children is that it will create fear among potential criminals
 lekin khauf paidaa karne vaali yah daleel aisi he, jiske bare main koi bhi vishwaas ke saath kuch nahin kah saktaa
 One, studies related to the role of capital punishment in preventing a crime are quite complicated in themselves and India does not have any such study
 2012 main america kii neshnal academy of sciensej ne mrityudand or isse paidaa hone vaale kathith khauf se jude tamaam adhyayanon kii samiksha ke baad kaha ki isse na to iske paksh main nateeja nikalataa he, na iske khilaaf
 It was suggested that the giving of death penalty would create fear, it should be abandoned
 aparaadh rokane main mrityudand kii anishchit upyogita ko bharat main bacchon ke khilaaf hone vaali yon hinsa kii kadavi sachaaiyon ke sandarbh main bhi dekha janaa chahie
 As part of preparations related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act (POCSO) 2012, the Ministry of Women and Child Development found in 2007 that more than half of children in the country face sexual harassment
 sarkari aankade (enciarabi 2016) main bhi kaha gaya ki lagbhag 95 fisadi abhiyukt peedit kii pahchaan ke hote hai—parivaar ke sadsy, padosi, dost yaa phir jaan-pahchaan ke duusare log
 Incidents of sexual abuse of children in India do not come due to the superstition prevalent in our socio-cultural environment and such is the biggest problem
 mrityudand kaa nateeja yah hoga ki aise maamalon kaa baahar aana or ghat jayega kyonki shikaayat par unka hi koi apana faansee par chadh jayega
 Based on these perspectives, our thinking proves that death penalty will reduce crime
 bacchon se balaatkaar ke maamalon main abhiyukt ko doshi tehraane kii prakriya apane aap main jatil he or yah baat centre for child and lau (enelesaiu, bangaluru) ke adhyayan se bhi sabit hoti he
 This institution reviewed the situation in five states between 2012 and 2016 after the implementation of Poxo
 jahaan apradhi jaan-pahchaan ke the, aise sattar fisadi se zyada maamalon main adalati kaarywahi ke dauraan bachche aaropon se mukar gaye
 The reality is that pleading guilty in cases involving Poxo is a difficult task
 keval 29 fisadi maamalon main dosha siddh ho sakaa

 karnataka kii chittapur vidhansabha congress kii sabase majboot siton main gini jaati he
 Priyank Kharge, son of veteran Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, has contested from this seat
 congress ke is majboot kile main bijepi ne sendhamari ke liye valmiki nik par daanv lagaaya he
 JDS has given its ally BSP a chance from here instead of fighting on this seat itself
 basapa ke devraja wike sahit 8 pratyaashee yahaan chunaav maidan main hai
 Given the triangular contest in this seat in the current election, the road will not be easy for Priyank Kharge of Congress, which is considered to be a parampargat seat of Congress' Chittapur assembly seat in Gulbarga district
 1957 se lekar ab tak is seat par 14 baar vidhansabha chunaav ho chuke hai
 Among them, the Congress candidate has won 10 times
 isi se congress kii yahaan par takat kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Whereas BJP and JDS won once and Janata Party twice
 chittapur vidhansabha kshetra 1957 se 2008 tak saamaanya seat thi
 This seat was reserved for Scheduled Castes in 2008 after delimitation
 yahi vajah rahi ki 2008 ke chunaav main chittapur vidhansabha seat se mallikarjun khadge chunaav main utre or unhone bijepi ummidavaar ko 17 hajaar 442 maton se maat di
 He resigned as MLA after Mallikarjun Kharge became an MP in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad is seat se upachunaav main unke bete priyank khadge maidan main utre lekin ve pita kii viraasat nahin bachaa sake
 Valmiki Naik of BJP opened the party account on this seat
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main priyank khadge ek baar phir congress se ummidavaar bane
 This time he did not disappoint the party, he defeated Valmiki Naik
 priyank khadge ko 69 hajaar 379 vot mili jabaki bijepi ke nik ko 38 hajaar 188 vot mili
 In this way Priyank was victorious by 31 thousand 191 votes
 priyank khadgedusri baar jeetne ke liye chittapur se utre hai
 Here they are facing a big challenge from the BJP as well as the BSP, but they are hoping to win by trusting Dalit and Muslim votes
 basapa dalit maton ke saath-saath vokkaliga samaaj ke voton kii aas lagaae hue he
 Yoga guru Baba Ramdev is once again in discussion
 uttarakhand sarkaar ne unke khilaaf ek-do nahin, balki 81 mukademe darj kiye hai
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, he called all the allegations leveled against him as false and said that Sonia and Rahul are behind this
 pesh hai unase baatcheet ke ansh:aapke khilaaf ek din main 81 mukademe darj kiye gaye hai
 What would you say? i will give a press conference and answer 81 cases
 main abhi yahi kahuunga ki duniya ke itihaas main kisi hard criminal par bhi itane saare mukademe darj nahin hue
 All these allegations are false
 ye 81, 84 or 85 jitne bhi mukademe hai sabakaa silsilewar jawaab duungaa
 This is a conspiracy of the Congress
 congress apni haar se baukhala gai he isliye ye sab kar rahi he
 But after six months, the Congress terror will end and it will be reduced to less than 100 seats in the general elections
 uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna ne aapke upar kiye gaye mukademon ke liye ek vishesh press conference bula kar jaankaree di?mukhyamantri kisi party kaa nahin, rajya kaa hota he
 This is a constitutional position
 lekin ye mukhyamantri to jaj ban gaye hai
 He made the allegations himself, gave the verdict himself
 khud hi press conference bulaakar aarope laga rahe hai
 The whole country will laugh at them
 aap par stamp duty kaa aarope laga he?baba ne aaj tak ek rupee kii naa chori kii or hi herapheri kii
 i have taken the land from the farmers, not the government
 congress par hi aarope kyon laga rahi he?congress ke liye teen sankat hai- rahul gandhi, ghotaalaa or baba ramdev
 Rahul Gandhi is a big crisis for the Congress
 wo modi ke saamne chiti hai
 Years ago, the scandal of millions of crores like Bofors and now 2G, Commonwealth and Colgate has turned the face of the entire Congress including PM
 congress ke liye baba ramdev saamaajik or aadhyatmik sankat he
 You have also been sued for kidnapping your brother? All is nonsense
 in congress waalon ke saath to khud profeshnal criminal jude hue hai
 They also serve drugs, murder and rape
 ham din raat apane ashram main khoji kute ghumaate hai taaki kuch gadabad naa ho jaae
 It is the job of the government to strengthen the hands of those who are engaged in building the country, but it is putting handcuffs in the hands and feet of the people and talons in the mouth
 modi kii tarah mujh par bhi aarope lagaae jate hai
 All this is a conspiracy of Sonia and her prince
 fakir vajeer ke saamne ladaai lard rahaa he
 Gujarat Home Minister Amit Shah spied the girl
 kya ye sahi he?ladki ke pita narendra bhai modi ke dost hai
 This CD is provided by Kapil Sibal
 modi nijee hamalaa kar rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi is called Shahzada, Sonia Gandhi is sick and Congress is called a bloody claw
 kya ye bhashaa upyukt he?bhashaa kii garima sabko rakhni chahie
 The country is made up of not abusive, but good governance, development and ideas
 sonia biimaar hai to unhen biimaar hi kaha jayega
 They probably have cancer, we will pray that they will be cured at the earliest
 rahul gandhi to shahjade kii tarah hi bartaav karte hai
 Modi is a candidate for the post of PM, but is the use of such language correct? India is not just a piece of soil

 aakraamakata par modi ko kya salaah denge?modi ko akramakata ke saath muddon kii baat kerani chahie
 One has to show issues on one side and aggression on the other
