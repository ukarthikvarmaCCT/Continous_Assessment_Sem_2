 Earlier in the Rajya Sabha, mps are asking questions on different issues
 is dauraan rajyasabha chairman venkaiya naidu ne congress ke diggaj netaa motilal vora kii tarif kii or nae saansadon ko unase sikh lene kii salaah di
 In fact, when the Congress mps stood up to speak, Venkaiah Naidu grabbed the attention of the new mps and said that Motilal Vora is speaking
 nae saansad unhen sunen ki kis tarah se wo sadan main aate hai or hissaa lete hai
 Take inspiration from them
 motilal vora sadan main supreme court main maamalon ko lekar sawaal puch rahe the
 He urged for the appointment of judges that the empty chairs should be filled and the age of the High Judge said that the age increase is 62 to 65
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri or upi ke rajyapal rah chuke 90 varshiya motilal vora kii ginati congress ke diggaj netaaon main hoti he

 Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has presented a new model of absurd rhetoric
 unhone apane vidhansabha kshetra main bijli ke liye virodh pradarshan kar rahe ek gut se do took kah diya ki unhone koi fark padataa ki ve log unke liye vot karte hai yaa nahin
 In fact, on Thursday, the CM of Bihar was addressing a rally in his constituency Makhdumpur in Jehanabad
 is dauraan kuch log apane gaanv main bijli ko lekar virodh pradarshan karne pahunche
 The protesters had placards on which it was written, 'no electricity, no vote
 
 
 ' virodh dekhakar jithan ram maanjhi ne kaha, 'mujhe koi fark nahin padataa ki aap log mujhe vot denge yaa nahin
 What is the meaning of such protests? Anyway, you do not vote for me
 'maanjhi yahi nahin ruke
 He asked the protesters in a blunt manner, 'do you think i win with your vote? Who is afraid of not getting your votes? i win because other people vote
 jithan ram maanjhi aap logon kii vot nahin dene kii khokhli dhamkee se nahin darane vaala
 After some time Jitan Ram Manjhi's anger subsided, he once assured that his government is committed to providing electricity to every village in Jehanabad district by September next year
 maanjhi ne baad main apane bayaan par safai bhi di
 He said that the people protesting are also his own
 haalanki bihar ke siem ke is bayaan ne vipaksh ko siyaasi waar karne kaa ek or mauka de diya
 Leader of opposition to Bihar Assembly, Nandar Kishore Yadav said, 'manjhi's statement reflects the thinking of the ruling JDU and RJD leaders
 ek vidhayak sirf use vot dene waalon logon kaa netaa nahin hota, vah puure kshetra kaa vidhayak hota he
 He is running away from his responsibilities
 aise bayaan samaaj ko baantne kaa kaam karte hai
 This is not the first time a political battle has arisen on the statement of Jeetan Ram Manjhi
 unhone haal hi main dalit chaatro ko jaat-paat chhodkar antarjaateey vivaah karne kii apil kii thi
 He said that if Dalits want to become political power, then they have to increase the population as well

 The 7 Lok Sabha seats of Delhi, the capital of the country, give a glimpse of the political mood of the country
 pichley 22 saalon main hindustan kii satta par usee party kaa raaj rahaa he, jisane loksabhaa chunaav main dilli kii janata kaa vishwaas jeeta he
 During this period, the people of Delhi have sometimes entrusted the responsibility of power to the Bharatiya Janata Party or to the Congress
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne dilli kii saaton loksabhaa siten jiti thim or centre main modi kii sarkaar bani thi to 2009 main dilli kii janata ne congress ke prati apana vishwaas jataayaa tha or saaton siten party kii jholii main di thi
 In the mirror of history, Delhi elections have been held since 1998 with the same party which has formed its government at the Center
 1998 main bijepi ko dilli main 7 main se 6 siten mili
 Then BJP under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee formed NDA with the support of many parties and formed a coalition government at the Center
 gathbandhan kii ye sarkaar maatr 13 maheene chali or 1999 main ek baar phir se loksabhaa chunaav hue
 In the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won all the seven seats in Delhi
 is baar bhi haalanki centre main party ko purna bahumat nahin mila lekin bijepi ne centre main gathbandhan kii sarkaar bana hi lee
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the Prime Minister of the country for the third time
 isse pehle 1996 main bhi vaajapeyi 13 dinon ke liye desh ke pradhanmantri bane the
 Even then BJP won 6 out of seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi
 congress ko mili satta2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main satta kaa chakra ghuma, camel nishaan se dilli ke logon kaa mohabhang hua or bijepi ko yahaan maatr 1 seat mili
 The Congress won 6 seats in Delhi
 congress ke varisht netaa dow manmohan singh desh ke piem bane
 The same pattern of voting took place in Delhi in 2009 also
 is baar congress ne dilli main apni pakad or bhi majboot kar lee or sabhi saaton siton par apana paracham laharaaya
 Dr
 Manmohan Singh became the Prime Minister of the country for the second time
 bijepi ko jiro siten dekar or centre kii satta se dur rakhkar dilli waalon ne ek baar phir se sabit kar diya gaya jo unka mizaaj rahata he, desh bhi usee raste par chalata he
 After 2014, the politics of Delhi changed: Loksabha elections, the voters of Delhi retained their old pattern
 2014 main desh kii tarah dilli main modi lahar dekhne ko mila
 All the seven seats in Delhi were lost to the Congress and came to bjp's account
 narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri bane
 However, it was only in 2013 that the Aam Aadmi Party knocked in Delhi politics, but the AAP failed to leave any mark in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 yahaan ek tathy yah bhi dilachasp he ki dilli ke vidhansabha chunaavon kaa pattern loksabhaa ke matdaan se alag rahata he
 The Congress continued to hold power in Delhi from 1998 to 2013
 baavjood iske party ko dilli main 1998 or 99 ke loksabhaa chunaav main munh kii khaani padi
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha in Delhi, the Congress, the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party, all three parties are contesting with full force

 In another incident, Arvind Kejriwal criticized Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari's attitude towards full statehood in the national capital and said that people should evict them from their homes when they come to seek votes
 yahaan jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kejariwal ne kaha tha ki tiwari logon ko bataa rahe hai ki rashtriya rajdhani ko purna rajya kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa
 He had said that when he comes to ask for votes, then get him out of his house because now he is saying that the national capital cannot be given full state status
 "arvind kejariwal ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki sabase kharaab cheez jo unhone kii, vah hinduon ko musalamaanon ke khilaaf khadaa kar rahe hai
 Arvind Kejriwal had said that he spoiled the communal harmony of the country

 narendra modi jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri the, tab ve vilakshan samaj kaa pradarshan karte dikhaai dete the ki rajya ke logon ko kis kism kii talim kii jarurat he
 He started the 'gunotsav', a festival of virtues, which was an innovative initiative focusing on how much and what children were learning
 ye vahi vakt tha, jab shiksha ke adhikaar (artii) kii badaulat logon kaa dhyaan skulon main maujuud classroom or khel ke maidaanon jaise muddon par ja rahaa tha
 The existence of low-budget private schools was in danger
 25 fisadi aarakshan kaa vivaadaaspad niyam lagu karavaaya ja rahaa tha (jise lagu karne kii ruparekha tay nahin kii gai thi)
 During the 'gunotsav', the Chief Minister and all his ministers, IAS and other senior officials would visit one-fourth of the schools of the state for three days every year without announcing, monitoring their conditions and also seeing what the children were being taught
 What is the result? jab modi ne dekha ki kuccha ke ek gaanv main saatvin kaksha ke chaatr thik se pard bhi nahin paa rahe hai, tab unhone unke mata-pita ko halki-si jhidki bhi di thi ki ve khud bacchon kii padhai main dilchaspee nahin lete or shikshakon se oonchi ummiden lagaate hai
 Nearly 10 states adopted the salient features of the 'gunotsav' program to focus on the results of the training
 yah tab kii baat he, jab modi ke pradhanmantri banane kii koi charchaa tak nahin thi
 Similarly, a program called 'wanche Gujarat' was started to inculcate the habit of studying in children, while Sports Festival was started to promote talent in competitive sports
 inamen se kuch pahal beshak moulik nahin thim, lekin amal kii gunvattta or nateezon par dhyaan dene kii vajah se ye rajya kii aam yojanaon se alag dikhaai detii thim
 The Department of Higher Education had given attention to speeding up internet access in colleges and improvement of research results
 bahut kam netaaon main yah doordarshita dikhaai detii he ki shiksha ke jariye kya hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the policies launched by Modi looked completely different
 phir is baat main bhala kya tajjub ki unke pradhanmantri banane par kuch zyada hi ummiden lagaai ja rahi thim?ek saal pehle maine isi magazine main likhaa tha ki sarkaar ko ek aisa echaradi mantri bananaa chahie, jo talim ke nateezon kii ahmiyat ko samajhataa ho
 Who together with others can map the change
 saath hi shiksha kii gunvattta or nawacharon par bhi dhyaan de sake
 Today when i look back, i find that these things have not been done
 kam-se-kam abhi tak to nahin kiye gaye hai
 The leader who is known for his passion for implementing the schemes very fast, the pace of advancing in the field of education under his rule is unfortunately very slow
 kuch log kah sakate hai ki talim ke maamle main sanbhalkar chalanaa behatar he
 Former Education Minister Kapil Sibal had passed the Right to Education Act within 100 days of UPA-2 and made cbse's 10th Board examination elective
 donon hi faisle na sirf vivaadaaspad the, balki ab bekaar or ulate nuksandaayak maane ja rahe hai
 So it may be right to walk slowly
 modi sarkaar ke pehle saal main shiksha ke kshetra main purvavarti sarkaar kii apeksha niskriyata kaa isse udaar moolyankan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The second explanation is that after his initial focus on economic issues, when Modi will focus on education, then the government will be seen taking some concrete steps
 to sarkaar ne shiksha ke maamle main aakhir kiya kya he? aaie, yahaan ham sarkaar kii kuch kamyaabiyon or saath hi kuch sabase badi chukon kii padtaal karen
 States' share in spending on education is a tricky issue to meet the challenges of education and it does not always get the answer
 sarkaar ne ek acha kadam uthaaya, jise thik tarah se samajha nahin gaya he
 a large financial portion of spending on education has been handed over to the states
 yah acha kadam he kyonki talim ke maamle main sarkaar kii pramukh yojanaon par amal kii jimmedaari rajyon kii he
 It is often feared that due to the weakening of both political will and ability to execute, states need pressure from the Center
 lekin iskaa sthaayee samaadhaan yahi he ki rajyon ko taqatvar banaaya jaae or unhen yojanaon par amal ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaae
 It is also the only way to develop the capabilities of the state
 talim ke maamle main sarkaar aaj jis sabase badi pahal kaa zikr karti he, vah he nai shiksha niti
 It seems that efforts are being made to create political awareness at the grassroots level and involve people on a much larger scale
 magar itani vishaal yuva aabaadi vaale is desh main, jahaan talim vaaki desh kaa bhavishya bana yaa bigaad sakati he, main 18 maheene pehle modi ke kahe gaye nitivakya ko tavajjo duungaa: ''desh ko kanoonon kii nahin, karravaayiyon kii jarurat he
 "the new education policy will be welcomed only when steps are taken to implement it as well
" uske bagaiyr akeli niti kuch nahin kar paaegi
 Economic incentives for some small steps girls, Swachh Vidyalaya Abhiyan, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, school evaluation framework, school mirror, ishan development and student interaction with scholars are some of the new initiatives of the government
 inkaa makasad ladakiyon kii shiksha main sudhaar laana, chaatro main ganit, vigyaan or navachaar ko badhaava dena, skulon ko javabdeh bananaa or mobile jaise sadhano ke jariye mata-pita ko bachche kii talim kaa jayja lene kaa mauka dena he
 It is obvious that instead of taking major fundamental steps that have far-reaching effects, this government has preferred symbolism
 pratikwaad apane aap main bura nahin he, magar uske saath thos kadam na uthaae jaaen to vah kaaphi had tak beasar rahata he
 The Prime Minister's engagement with schools and teachers on Teachers' Day was a good step
 gaur karnaa chahie ki inamen se kuch pichhali sarkaar kii pahalakadamiyaan thim, jinhen sirf jari rakhaa gaya he
 Many of these did not have the same effect as expected (for example: the Ishan Development Initiative to better connect and develop schools in the Northeastern states)
 nai sarkaar ne mulat: upie-1 ke dauraan ghoshit 6,000 model skulon ko milane vaali centre sarkaar kii sahaayta band karne kaa bhi faisla kiya
 i consider this a good move because there is no evidence that the model of private-public partnership with differential fees at the block headquarters would work well
 gaiyr-jaruri vivadakendriya vidyalayon main german bhashaa kii jagah sanskrit ko laane kaa vivaad, bhartiya praudyogiki sansthaanon (iity) or rashtriya shaikshik anusandhan tathaa prashikshan parishad (ensiiarti) ke pramukhon se jude mudde or paathya pustakon ke bhagavakaran ke aarope—in sabakaa sarkaar kii chhavi par bura prabhaav padaa
 Even if the media exaggerated them
 sarkaar kii chukon kii fehrist badakismati se zyada badi he
 a clear map is needed to make a move in the field of education, but it has not been made
 duusare, lagata he, shiksha vibhaag ko yah sud hi nahin ai he ki 'mek in india' pahal kaa vaasta jitna duusari chizon se he, utana hi shiksha or kaushal vikaas se bhi he
 These could have been golden occasions, which were probably lost
 sansthaaon ko majboot bananaayensiiarti ke nideshak kaa pad kai maheenon se khaali padaa he, lekin ise bharne kii prakriya tak shuru nahin hui he
 Institutions like the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), which determine the future of hundreds of thousands of youth, are facing a serious crisis of quality and capacity
 in muddon ko sulajhane or halaat ko badalane ke liye nai shiksha niti kii jarurat he
 Each time only 1-10% of the teachers who appear in the teacher qualifying exam are able to pass it
 isse saaf pataa chalata he ki hamaari shikshan vyavastha or is pariksha ke bich kitni gambhir khai he
 These issues can be resolved through academic and administrative measures
 yah kaam bahut teji se kiye jane kii jarurat he
 One of the biggest contributions of the government may be to help set up institutions like the Central Institute of Research Studies to find answers to India's biggest educational challenges (iits, iims, Aquas and ncerts have been created for this purpose)
 is par na koi vivaad hoga or na hi apekshaakrit zyada kharch aayega
 Significant policy changes that have not taken place have resulted in extreme disintegration of the old policy of opening schools within one kilometer of the house
 is niti main badlaav kii jarurat he taaki jahaan jarurat ho, vahaan mukrat parivahan suvidha ke saath skulon ko majboot banaaya ja sake
 This will make it easier for parents to send children to school
 bharat ko 'samasya ko drishy bananeó ke liye piiese sareekhe antarrashtriya moolyankanon main hissaa lenaa chahie
 In PISA 2010, when Shanghai was at the top of the world, we were ranked 73rd among 74 countries
 iskaa jawaab hamane is faisle se diya ki bhavishya main ham isamen hissaa hi nahin lenge
 There is a great need for revision and clarity in RTE as well, but no progress has been made there either
 ek or badi kami yah he ki soochna or sanchaar praudyogiki (isiti) par zyada majbootee se jor nahin diya ja rahaa he
 Here are five major initiatives that have not even started yet: (1) To update the database (district Education Information System) of each school so that every student, teacher and their learning level is monitored
 So that the latest data can be made available at all times
 (2) bhagidaari ke jariye shiksha ke liye prabhavi software banane par dhyaan dena
 (3) Research on ICT based systems to overcome the basic shortcomings of studies in India and teaching like basic mathematics
 (4) shikshakon ke istemaal ke liye ucch gunvattta kii online shikshak sahaayta pranali viksit karnaa, jisamen video or anya sansaadhan shaamil hon
 (5) Development of cheap (like Aakash) but high quality (not like Aakash) tablets, but also to make its software useful for schools
 kul milakar chote-mote kaaryakramon or yojanaon se mahaj thok-peet karne kii bajaae sarkaar ko chahie ki vah un kshetron main thos kadam uthaane par dhyaan de, jinase sachmuch fark padegaa
 Changing education is a complicated issue, but if the government moves in this direction, others will also come forward to participate in this process

 samaajawaadee party (sapa) adhyaksh evam uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke chachere bhai or badaayun se sapa saansad dhamendra yadav ne uttar pradesh kii bhaajapa sarkaar main do upmukhyamantri banaaye jane ko asanvaidhanik qaraar diya he
 Yadav expressed surprise at the arrangement of two deputy chief ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government of the state during sp's membership drive in Badaun, Bisauli and Bilsi assembly constituencies, saying that there is no arrangement for any post like deputy chief minister in the country's constitution
 
 unhone kaha ki magar iske baavjood bhaajapa ne samvidhan kii avhelnaa or apmaan kar dinesh sharma or keshav maury ke rup main pradesh main do upmukhyamantri banaaye hai jo ‘asanvaidhanik’ he
 The comments yadav ne bisauli kshetra main kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki sapa kaa janm sangharsh kii jameen se hua hai
 Socialists have always fought, that is why SP is not only a party, but also the largest organization in the country
 saansad ne aarope lagaaya ki pradesh main gehun kray kendra sirf kaagajon par chal rahe hai
 He said that BJP has maligned the former Akhilesh Yadav SP government in the name of hooliganism but the truth is that in the last two months, criminals have become autocratic and attacks on police and officers in many districts of the state are the latest of hooliganism of BJP For example
 yadav ne badaayun, bisauli or bilsee vidhaan sabha kshetra main sapa ke sadsyta abhiyaan ke dauraan pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar main do upmukhyamantri banaaye jane kii vyavastha par aashcharya vyakt karte hue kaha ki desh ke samvidhan main upmukhyamantri jaise kisi bhi pad kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 He said that despite this, the BJP has made two Deputy Chief Ministers in the state as Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Maurya, which is 'unconstitutional' by disobeying and insulting the Constitution
 tippaniyan Addressing the workers in Bisauli area, Yadav said that SP was born from the land of struggle
 samaajwaadiyon ne sadaiv sangharsh kiya he, yahi vajah he ki sapa sirf ek party hi nahin, balki desh kaa sabase bada sanghathan bhi he

 The Ministry of Home Affairs forwards division is under the scanner of the CBI as many files are not found
 isse pehle internal security division se ishrat kii fil gaayab ho gayi thi
 On the other hand, Anand Joshi has gone missing from his house by writing a letter to his wife
 lekin apane is under secretary kii ye khabar grih mantralay ke paas nahin he
 Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said, "we do not know right now but haiku will know about it
 " But the matter is serious, so all the files are under audit in the Ministry of Home Affairs' Division
 ashanka he ki kai filon se sikret nots gaayab hai
 It is believed that the sensitive public bodies associated with the ngos have been gathered by the ministry
 enditivi india ko mili jaankaree ke mutabiq grih mantralay kaa prashasnic vibhaag filon to kaise root kiya jaataa he, unke mutlik nae niyam bhi bana rahaa he
 On the other hand, all the officials of FCRA have come under the scanner of CBI
 grih mantralay ke mutabiq joshi ne november 2015 main qareeb 60 ngos ko notice bheje the
 Through these notices, cleanliness was being sought from all those ngos
 ye sabhi videshi madad se chalane vaale ngos hai jinhen baahar se paisa aata tha
 But the question is whether the under-secretary can get such an action done by himself
 kyonki notice bhejne ke liye varisht adhikari kii manjuuri zaruri hoti he
 The CBI will now interrogate all the officers working in FCRA
 tippaniyan Anand Joshi's wife is also directly blaming Additional Secretary BK Prasad
 udhar bike prasad ne apni safaai main enditivi ko bataaya, kyonki unhone CBI ko shikaayat di thi or exiaar main unka naam he isliye unhen nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 By the way, this is not the first time that the FCRA division has seen disturbances
 isse pehle chini netaaon ko visa dene ke masale par bhi bharat kii koob kirakiri hui he, wo bhi isi vibhaag ke kaaran
 In such a situation, the question is that what is going on in the Ministry of Home Affairs
 udhar anand joshi apni patni ko chitthee likhakar apane ghar se gaayab ho gaye hai
 But this news of this under-secretary is not with the Ministry of Home Affairs
 grih rajya mantri kiren rijiju ne kaha, "hamen abhi pataa nahin he lekin iske bare main jaankaree hiku karenge
 " lekin maamla gambhir he isliye grih mantralay ke forenurs division main sabhi filon kaa audit chal rahaa he
 It is feared that secret notes are missing from many files
 mana ja rahaa he kii ngos se judi samvedansheel janakariyaan jo mantralay ne ikattha kii thi wo un ngos tak pahunch chuki he
 According to information received by NDTV India, the administrative department of the Ministry of Home Affairs is also making new rules regarding how files are routed
 udhar FCRA ke sabhi afasar CBI kii jaanch ke dayare main aa chuke hai
 According to the Home Ministry, Joshi had sent notices to about 60 ngos in November 2015
 in noticeon ke zarie un sabhi ngos se safaai maangi ja rahi thi
 These are all foreign-funded ngos who used to get money from outside
 lekin sawaal he ki kya under secreteri apane aap se is tarah kii karwaai kar saktaa he
 Because to send the notice, approval of senior officer is required
 CBI ab FCRA main kaam karne vaale sabhi afasaron se poochtacha karegi
 The comments anand joshi kii patni bhi aarope sidhe adishnal secreteri bike prasad par laga rahi he
 On the other hand, BK Prasad told NDTV in his cleaning, because he had given a complaint to the CBI and his name is in the FIR, hence he is being targeted
 vaise ye pehali baar nahin jab FCRA division main gadabadi saamne aayi ho
 Earlier, on the issue of visa to Chinese leaders, India has also been very bad, due to this department
 aise main sawaal laazmi he ki akhir chal kya rahaa he grih mantralay main

 The echoes of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's slap are heard once again in the political corridor of Karnataka
 kabhi ek vidhayak ko thappad maarane vaale siem sahab is baar ek sarkari adhikari ko thappad raseed karne ke kaaran surkhiyon main hai
 It is said that the Chief Minister was not finding the way empty by the crowd, he slapped the Municipal Commissioner
 jaankaree ke mutabik, karnataka ke siemsiddaramaiyaburocret ko rasta khaali karne ke liye kah rahe the, bheed kaaphi thi to unhone pareshaan hokar haath uthaa diya
 However, clarification is being made on behalf of the cm's close friends that the CM was not aware that the person on whom he has demonstrated his force is the Municipal Commissioner of Bellary
 nadaan janata kii bheed or thappadghatana shanivaar subah bellari kii hi he, jahaan siem ek baithak main hissaa lene pahunche the
 a crowd of supporters of the Chief Minister gathered there
 sabhi apane chahetemukhyamantrise milanaa chaahate the or unhen guladasta bhent karne ke liye aage badhane lage
 But what does the innocent public know that Netaji, who wanted a crowd at the time of elections, is now troubling the crowd
 bataaya jaataa he ki isi dauraan bellari ke municipal kamishnar siem aage aa gaye, jiske baad siem ne sidhe unke gaalon par thappad jad diya
 The people associated with the Chief Minister say that all this is an incident during the crowd
 tark yah bhi diya ja rahaa he kisiddaramyaco is baat kii jaankaree nahin thi ki vah shaks bellari ke municipal kamishnar hai
 Whatever the reason, the use of slap to deal with the crowd will be considered wrong, whether it is cheek officer or common man
 baharhaal, khabaron kii duniya se lekar soshal media par netaji ke 'baahubal' kii tasviren or video charchaa main aa gai hai
 CM Siddaramaiah of Karnataka has been caught on camera during the slapping in public places before
 isse pehle unhen vidhayak shivamurti ko thappad maarthe hue dekha ja chukaa he, lekin iske jawaab main unhone kaha tha ki vah unhone pyaar se maaraa tha

 apni rivyuu pitishan me dilli sarkaar ne engiti ko kaha he ki vah baaki or rajyon main bhi od-ivan lagu karne kaa aadesh de
 It includes the states of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan
 aise main dilli sarkaar ko od-evan sharton ke saath lagu karne aadesh dene vaali engiti kya or rajyon ko od-ivan lagu karne kaa aadesh degi, ye bada sawaal he?dilli me tu whilers or mahilaon kood-evanke dauraan kisi bhi tarah kii koi chhot dene ko lekar engiti pehle hi manaa kar chukaa he
 Nevertheless, in its review petition, the Delhi Government has given some figures and said that about 68 lakh two wheelers are in Delhi
 isamen se od-ivan ke dauraan kareeb 25 lakh tu whilers dilli kii sadakon par honge
 If they are not removed from odd-even, then Delhi needs about 2500 new buses, which are not currently with the government
 iske alaava mahilaon ko od-ivan main chhot dene par bhidilli sarkaarne apana paksh rakhte hue kaha he od-ivan ke dauraan public transport pehle hi bheed-bhaad vaala hota he
 In such a situation, if women are also included, then this journey will prove to be a very painful journey for them
 apane rivyuu pitishan main dilli sarkaar ne engiti ko yah bhi kaha he ki philhal mahilaon or tu whealer ko tab tak dur rakhaa jaae jab tak ki dilli sarkaar 2000 nai bason kaa intjaam naa kar le or iske liye sarkaar ko kareeb 1 saal ke vakt kii jarurat he
 It has to be seen whether the NGT, which has already refused any concession regarding two wheelers and women, gives any relief on this review petition of Delhi Government

 yah vakt auto companiyon kaa inventary karection kaa time he, isliye companiyaan purana stock maujuuda vakt main nikaal rahi hai
 Another reason for the production cut is that due to the new safety and BS6 norms, companies may discontinue some models

 Dhoni did this by catching the catch of Daren Bravo in the first innings of West Indies off Praveen Kumar
 dhoni ke alaava keval saiyad kirmani (160 kaich or 38 stamping) ne hi bharat kii ore se test cricket main 150 se adhik kaich lapke hai
 The Indian captain, playing in his 55th Test, has made 176 victims with 151 catches and 25 stumpings

 Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the opposition parties are trying to build a grand alliance
 virdohi dalon kaa maananaa he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aguai vaali bijepi kii chunauti kaa saamana karne ke liye mahagathbandhan samay kii jarurat he
 But due to contradictions in the opposition camp, the way to make the grand alliance on the ground reality is not easy at the moment
 vipakshi kheme main do tarah kii vichaar prakriya ubharate dekhi ja sakati he
 The first opinion is that an alliance is formed by the Congress at the Center
 duusari raay main congress or bijepi, donon se hi alag rahane kii pakshdhar partiyon kaa teesraa morcha khadaa karne par jor diya ja rahaa he
 According to sources, the Congress is not happy with the Samajwadi Party not sending any representatives to Rahul Gandhi's Iftar party
 wo bhi aisi sthiti main ki samaajawaadee party adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne jamiyat-e-ulema hind chif arshad madani ke id milan samaaroh main khud hissaa liya
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was also present at the ceremony
 congress sutron kaa kahana he ki party adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii ore se apane sipahasalaron or rajya prabhariyon ko pehle hi sabhi staron par sanghathan ko majboot kiye jane ke nirdesh die ja chuke hai
 Emphasis has been laid on giving management edge, especially at the booth level
 chhattisgarh ke liye congress ke prabharee incharge piel puniya ne india today se kaha, 'jab takamahagathbandhansamne nahin aata, ham party sanghathan ko jamini str par majboot banane main jute hai
 We are not worried about whether a grand alliance is formed or not
 rahul gandhi har rajya kii sthiti ko dekh rahe hai
 The alliance will depend on the situation of a particular state
 'mahagathbandhan ke raste main siton kaa bantwaaraa bhi bada mudda he
 Recently, the Samajwadi Party leaders indicated that the party was in favor of leaving only two seats for the Congress in Uttar Pradesh
 trinmul congress supremeo mamata banerjee kii ore se bhi ateet main kai maukon par left partiyon or congress par nishaanaa saadhaa ja chukaa he
 Recently, during the confrontation between Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor, the way Mamata Banerjee and Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy came to Delhi and supported Kejriwal, the main opposition party Congress did not like it
 congress kaa maananaa he ki isse ye sanket gaya ki vipaksh ekajute nahin he
 CPI leader and Rajya Sabha member d Raja says, 'every party is positioning according to its own and each one is trying to contest as many seats as possible
 lekin ham is ranneeti par kaam kar rahe hai ki virdohi dal apane mul uddeshy ko naa bhul jaaen or wo he bijepi ko haraana
 Therefore, all parties should work in practical terms and should be more generous to each other
 'haalanki virdohi dalon ke netaa ye bhi kah rahe hai ki mahagathbandhan par baat karnaa abhi jaldbaaji hoga
 At the same time, they also say that at the moment they are insisting on a strategy that can bring everyone under one umbrella
 congress netaa pramod tiwari kehete hai, 'congress adhyaksh pehle hi kah chuke hai ki ham sabhi samaan soch vaali partiyon ko ekajute karenge or bijepi ko maat denge
 'congress President Rahul Gandhi had said on behalf of the party on the campaign of' Save the Constitution 'that the Grand Alliance has started taking shape and it will come into existence in six months
 america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ne kaha ki af paak kshetra main lagaataar chalaaye ja rahe aatankwaad nirodhak abhiyaan ke kaaran al kaayda kaa netaa osama bin laden or uskaa sahaayak kisi behad surakshit sthaan main chalaa gaya he
 But he also cautioned that America needs to be cautious
 obama ne 11 sitambar ko world trade tower par hue hamale kii naunvi barsi kii purv sandhya par kaha, ‘pichley do saal main ham is baat main kaaphi safal rahe ki hamane al kaayda or uske pramukh netaaon par dabaav kaaphi badha diya
 "he said," As a result, situations have arisen for him that he is finding it very difficult to work
 ’ obama ne kaha, ‘‘jo kuch hua usee ke kaaran bin laden kisi gahari gupha main chalaa gaya
 Even Jawahari who comes out again and again has become more vigilant
 ’ Many books are like events
 kisi bade nirnaayak vaake-si jindagi main ghatati hai
 You don't read the book, the book gets itself read and makes a place in your memories
 malchand tiwadi kii borunda diariah apratim bijji kaa vidaa geet aisi hi kitaab he
 Not a book, but a document of the last days of his life
 kuch apratim shabdachitr hai
 It seems as though Bijji is sitting in front and everything written is actually happening in front of the eyes
 koi cinema chal rahaa ho jaise
 The Tiwari Rajasthani writer Vijayadan Detha, who lived with him in his village for a long time in the last days of Bijji
 ve vahaan rahakar rajasthani main likhi unki kitaab baataan ri phulwari kaa hindi anuwaad kar rahe the
 Borunda Diary is a diary of the same last days of Bijji, in which his everyday things are recorded
 bijji apni dhundhlati ankhon se kitaaben, patrikaayen palat rahe hai
 The old eyes now suffer from the inability to read
 ve kamare main tapak rahe pani kii aawaaj sun rahe hai
 The water is not actually dripping, yet it is heard
 ve apni patni ko yaad kar rahe hai, tiwadi kii khaane kii thali main katoriyaan gin rahe hai, kabhi tabiyat thik rahi to bade swaad se khaanaa kha rahe hai, jaade main kanghee snaan kar rahe hai, pard nahin sakate to padhakar sunaane ko kah rahe hai, tagada kar rahe hai, kal raat diary likhi yaa nahin
 Sometimes they are afraid like a child and sometimes they are happy like a groom
 ek din to had hi kar baithe
 Said, "if you write so well on the death of a writer, then write on me and teach me
 marane ke baad to duusare hi padhenge
 How will i read "this is Bijji
 ham sab jivan main pyaar karte hai
 But never feel like someone will fall in love
 bijji kii maujuudagi bhar main vah saare bhav, komalta or sachai thi, jo prem main hoti he
 All this love has flowed in this book after filtering from Bijji's memories
 jo jaanate hai unhen, is diary ko padhgaye ke baad ve or jaananaa chahenge
 Those who do not know will wander in search of their writings
 vah bijji ko khoj-khojkar padhenge
 Everyone in everyday life will steal time between businesses so that they can know more
 kisi kitaab kii isse badi takat or tarif nchaya hogi ki vah padhane vaale ke sirahaane rakhi mili
 The person who read them started living it
 bas, yahi he is kitaab kii takat
 Like Tulsidas said that i am nothing
 ek maamuli-sa insaan
 No knower, no scholar
 vah to katha ram kii thi to likhaa hua mahaan ho gaya
 Tiwari also says in the same style, "who am I? If that story was about Bijji then the book became big

 dilli main ek maasoom bacchee ke saath balaatkaar kii koshish kaa sharmnaak maamla saamne aayaa he
 Where a neighbor took an eight-year-old innocent to the forest and tried to rape her
 bacchee ke shor machaane par log maukey par pahunch gaye, jinhen dekhakar aaropee bhaagane laga
 But people caught him running
 maamla purvi dilli ke mandawali ilaake kaa he
 Where the 8-year-old child lived, his neighbor youth used to come often
 choti bacchee use bhaiya bolaa karti thi
 The child's family also believed in him with his eyes closed
 vahiin yuvak bacchee ko bahala phuslaa kar apane saath jangal main le gaya or bacchee ke saath rape karne kii koshish karne laga
 The child got nervous seeing his actions and started making noise
 isi dauraan paas se guzar rahe ek rahgeer bacchee kii aawaaj sunakar jangal ke taraf bhaaga
 He saw on the spot that the accused was trying to rape the young girl
 rahgeer ne shor machaakar or logon ko bula liya
 During this time, seeing the people coming, the accused started fleeing from there, but the people ran and caught him and handed him over to the police
 police ne aaropee ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 354 / 8 posco act ke tahat mukadmaa darj kar liya he

 aise main haal kii kuch ghatnaon ke maddenjar aaie dekhte hai ki kin 5 filmi role main shashikala feet baith sakati hai
 1 in the Amavasai role of Amaidhi Padai
 tamil film amaidhi padai (amaidhi Padai) ke amavasaai ke role menshashikala behad fitbaithti hai
 The similarity between the two is that Amavasai and Sasikala have been close to powerful politicians at one time
 iske alaava amavasaai ne apane hi netaa ko gaddi se utaar tak khud pad hasil kiya tha
 2
 chandramukhi kii gangajayalalita ke nidhan ke baad jis tarah se shashikala se judi chijen badali hai, aise main chandramukhi kii ganga ke role main bhi vah feet baithti hai
 In the film, Ganga imagines herself as Chandramukhi
 film main ek femes dialog bhi he jisamen kaha gaya he -ganga chandramukhiki tarah poj detii he
 
 
 And then Ganga becomes Chandramukhi
 3
 Like Pudhupettai's Kokki Kumar, one of the best films of Tamil cinema is the story of Kokki Kumar, a gangster in Pudhupettai
 haalanki, aapako aashcharya ho saktaa he ki shashikala ke kairactor se iskaa kya sambandh
 But after watching the film, you will know that the same things are going on in the mind of both the characters
 4
 Like Gandhi Babu in Sathuranga Vettai, Sasikala comes from a small town
 shashikala ke kai sambandhi ediemke main pramukh padon par hai
 He has also been charged with disproportionate assets
 aise main film ke gandhi babu ke role main bhi shashikala behad sahi ho sakati hai
 5
 bahubali ke katappa ke role menchunki shashikala par kai vivaadaaspad aarope bhi lage hai
 Many questions are also arising over Jayalalithaa's death
 sawaal he ki kya jayalalita ko shashikala ne maaraa? aise main bahubali film ke katappa ke role main bhi shashikala feet ho sakati hai

 (input from IANS) ol india muslim personal lau board ke agxcutive member rahe salmaan nadvi par amarnath mishra ne bada aarope lagaaya he
 Mishra says that Nadvi wanted a deal of 5 thousand crores in lieu of leaving the mosque claim
 ram janmabhumi sadbhaavna samiti ke adhyaksh or shrishri ravishankar ke sabase kareebi amarnath mishra ne aarope lagaaya he ki jis formule ko lekar salmaan nadvi or sunni central board ke adhyaksh shrishri ravishankar se milane gaye the
 Behind that formula was a preparation for a big deal
 amarnath mishra ne kaha ki yah formula darasal unka tha jo unhone 5 farvari kosalman nadvior duusare muslim netaaon ko diya tha, lekin usee mulaakaat ke dauraan salmaan nadvi ne is deal kii evaj main 5000 karod rupye, ayodhya main 200 acre jameen or rajyasabha kii ek seat maangi thi
 According to Amarnath Mishra, this was done to him so that this matter of Nadvi could be conveyed to the big people associated with the construction of the temple and to the Chief Minister and the Prime Minister and somehow the deal could be confirmed
 mishra ne khaas baatcheet main ajtak ko bataaya ki dil kii yah baat sabhi bade netaaon ko bataa di gai he, yahaan tak kii shri ravishankar ko bhi maaloom he
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak, Amarnath Mishra said, "muslims had gone to many members of the Personal Law Board with the formula for settlement of out-of-court settlement
" unhone yah formula salmaan nadvi ko bhi diya tha, taaki is par muslim personal lau board kii baithak main charchaa ho sake is charchaa kaa bharosa salmaan nadvi ne amarnath mishra ko bhi diya tha
 Mishra claims that instead of discussing the matter with the board, Salman Nadvi went straight to Sri Sri Ravi Shankar about this formula and from there he announced this formula
 amarnath mishra ke mutabik deal kii koi baat shrishri ravishankar se kii gai yaa nahin yah unhen nahin maaloom, lekin yah baat unase zarur kii gai thi or unke paas is baat ke pukhta pramaan bhi hai

 The beauty of the bridge lies in the river and the beauty of the river lies in the bridge
 ganga kii hi dhara hughali nadi ko aap donon shaharon kolkata or haavda kii lifline kah sakate hai
 But this 'lifeline' itself has become difficult to live due to the filth of garbage and drains
 ganga apane aakhri padaav main bengal kii khadi main samahit hone se pehle sunderbans delta se pashchim bengal main pravesh karti he
 This is the reason that the level of dirt in the river is the highest here
 pashchim bengal main 222 bade or chote naale apane saath tamaam gandagi ganga main giraate hai
 Experts explain how garbage, chemicals and pesticides are polluting the Ganges
 bharat sarkaar or nagar nikaayon kii ore se karodon rupye kharch kiye jane ke baad bhi ground jiro par sthiti behatar hoti najar nahin aa rahi
 On behalf of this reporter, Durga Puja Utsav is being covered since 2005
 tab se ab main sthiti main kaaphi badlaav aayaa he
 Now it is only due to cultural belief that idols are immersed

 lekin puure saal chalane vaale chote puja utsavon par sakhti nahin hone kii vajah se niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya jaataa
 Environmental activist Subhash Dutta has run many campaigns but believes that the goal of making the Ganga clean is far-fetched
 datta ke mutabik, samaadhaan ye he ki ganga main har jagah sivej ke pani ko bina treet hue girane se roka jaae
 For this, sewage drainage systems need to be built on a large scale
 samaadhaan sirf bengal tak hi simit nahin ho saktaa
 Towards a solution, there should be work from the point of origin of the Ganges to the end
 gangaake paas 80 chote-bade shahar, kareeb 1000 gaanv based hue hai
 Drainage sewage systems need to be built on both sides of the Ganges

 Dr
 Sugata Hazra, director and professor of the School of Marine Studies at Jadavpur University, told India Today, “ganga is the most polluted in the northern part of Bengal
 yahaan prati litre phekal coliform bacteria 160,000 se zyada he
 Every day a large amount of untreated sewage water is found in the Ganges
 aise main ganga kaa pani pine ke liye to dur nahaane ke liye bhi istemaal karnaa khatre se khaali nahin he
 This is a serious matter for the people of Bengal and the city
 audyogic kachare par niyantran ke saath kitnashkon or rasayanon ko ganga main girane se har keemat par roka janaa chahie
 It should be given top priority
 nahin to ye pine ke pani ke sankat ko sirf bengal main hi nahin puure desh main nyotaa dene jaisaa he
 In that river, which is called the lifeline of the state, the future of the state is seen in darkness due to pollution
 ”kolkata jise ‘city of joy’ kaha jaataa he, lekin yahaan ganga kii jo badahaali he, use dekhte hue bhavishya main ise ‘badboo ke shahar’ ke taur par janaa jane lage to koi badi baat nahin
 The total length of the Ganges is 2500 kilometers
 isamen se aakhri 250-260 kilometre kaa hissaa pashchim bengal main padataa he
 Kolkata is an ancient city
 yahaan sadiyon se maanav aabaadi basii hui he
 The foundations of industries also fell here long ago
 isliye yahaan ganga kaa pradooshan bhi sabase zyada he
 The Ganga Action Plan started in 1984 due to increasing pollution

 ghaaton ke kinare majboot karne ke saath landscaping or ghat par samuchit lite kii vyavastha ke liye bhi fund kii jarurat he
 Every day a large number of devotees visit Babughat
 swatchta ke naam par paisa to kharch kiya ja rahaa he lekin ganga ko phir ‘pavitra’ banane ke liye nishchit rup se bhagirath kaaryon kii jarurat he

 After the rebuke of the High Court, the dismissal of Mahipal Maderna was finally forced, now the daily chapter of Rajasthan Congress has started
 rajasthan main maderna kaa hashr madhumita cond ke doshi amarmani treepathi jaisaa hone kaa abhas hote hi alaakaman ke ishaare par mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne bhale unase kinaaraa kar liya ho, lekin unke mantrimandal main daagi mantriyon kii lambii hoti list philhal unhen chaiyn se nahin baithne degi
 There are a dozen ministers in the Gehlot cabinet, who have either directly filed cases or are under siege
 khud gahalot, jinhone apni kursi bachaane ke liye gopalgarh prakaran main grih mantri shanti dhariwal kaa vibhaag badalane kii taiyaari kar lee he, lekin dangon se pehle mukhyamantri ko dhariwal kii ore se bheje gaye gopneey aantarik note se gahalot kii naakaami saaf dikh rahi he
 In a note sent on August 18, the Home Minister had warned the Chief Minister after local meetings that Superintendent of Police Hinglaj Dan was not able to handle the case, but Gehlot kept his silence in view of the local mla's influence in the deployment and transfer
 Took care grih mantralay kaa yah note congress alaakaman kii ore se bheji gai raashid alvi team kii report kii bhi kalai kholta he, jisamen sirf dhariwal par thikra phoda gaya he
 In a conversation with India Today, State Home Minister Shanti Dhariwal confirms this note

 The alleged involvement of the sacked Maderna and MLA Malkhan Singh in the lost Bhanwari Devi scandal has spoiled the socio-political mathematics of the Congress in western Rajasthan

 Khan, however, apologized to the President during his recent visit to Jaipur

 Like Maderna, the Minister of Forests and Environment (independent Charge) Ramlal Jat is pointing fingers at Paras Devi's alleged suicide
 un par aarope lag rahaa he ki unhone jabaran raat main paras devi ke postmortem kaa aadesh colector se liya
 Congress leader and former minister Drs

 While the second minister in the cabinet, Dhariwal, is being blamed for the meo-gurjar clash in the internal report of the party itself, the statements made by him have made the Congress uncomfortable
 dhariwal ne pulisavaalon ko trek bharkar jane or gaanv waalon ko petakar aane kaa vivaadaaspad bayaan diya, to uttar pradesh jaakar bhrashtachar ke mudde par bayaan diya ki ''yahaan bori bharkar mithai dene se kaam hota he, jabaki rajasthan main ek dibbe se hi kaam chal jaataa he

 apane ghar ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe chaatro par lathicharge or skool shikshakon ko ulataa latakaane jaise apamaajanak bayanon ko lekar ve surkhiyon main rahe hai

 The role of Kak is also being accused in the controversial Jalmahal episode
 haal hi main hycourt ne jalmahal vivaad main purv mukhyamantri or vipaksh kii netaa vasundhara raaje ko bari kar diya he
 But many powerful leaders of anti-gehlot believe that as the investigation of the Jalmahal case progresses, the matter will blow Gehlot's head
 gahalot ke pehle kaarykaal ke aakhri dinon main hi jalmahal ke aasapaas ke kshetra main jameen aavantit kii gai thi
 a senior Congress MLA even goes so far as to say, "yeddyurappa's scam will be nothing in front of the Jalmahal scam
" '' khaadi-gramodyog rajyamantri golmaa devi kaa istipha prakaran hameshaa gahalot sarkaar ko sharmasaar karata rahaa he
 Despite resigning several times, Gehlot is unable to show him the way out of the cabinet

 Says Ghanshyam Tiwari, deputy leader of the opposition, "the Gehlot government has lost its moral and statutory right to rule
 mantrimandal main adhikansh daagi hai, jo akarmanya or nirankush hai, isliye is sarkaar ko bhang kar dena chahie
 '' While Pradesh Congress President Dr
 chandrabhan kehete hai, ''jab party main koi netaa-mantri vivaadon main fansata he to usase party or sarkaar kii chhavi kharaab hoti he
 But the Congress is a big party, where the image of the entire party is not tarnished by being trapped by two or four people
 lekin koi doshi he, to kanoon apana kaam karegaa, parrty use nahin bachaayegi
 But another senior state Congress leader admits that Gehlot's way of dealing with the maderna-malkhan and Amin Khan cases has angered vishnoi-muslim voters, while Meo, Gurjar and Meena are already raging in society
 is
 ye netaa kehete hai, ''aaj ke halaat main ham rajnatik rup se khatm ho chuke hai or sanghathan se lekar sarkaar tak saamaajik uthal-puthal machi hui he
 "despite all these allegations, Gehlot is not able to prove himself capable to control his ministers and take immediate political decisions

 Due to illness, the body became a little weak and could not adapt itself to the needs of the game

 Sukhwinder says that Yuvraj used to constantly ask him when he would play India and in response, the coach used to set a target for his disciple
 isi tarah ek vaakiye kaa zikr karte hue sukhwinder ne kaha, vah baar-baar bolta tha ki main india kab kheloongaa
 In such a situation, i used to set a target for him
 main kahata tha ki tu pehle ranjai khel
 When he played Ranji, i said if you felt hundreds, then i will take you a Reebok shoe of Rs 5000
 yuvi ne pehle shatak ke baad gift ke rup main bheja tha juutousane jab haryana ke khilaaf ranjai trophy main pehla 100 kiya tab mujhe juuta bheja bhi
 He had talent, but i had a strong feeling inside that he would play for India
 mujhe to yahaan tak lagata tha ki yah world cap main bhartiya team kii captaini bhi karegaa or main dressing room main baithkar match dekhuunga
 Sukhwinder has also described the contribution of Yuvraj's mother Shabnam in her career, who always stood with her son in every ups and downs of life on the backdoor

 Researchers at the Faculty of Life Sciences at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark found that the development of lactating babies is different from that of outside milk drinkers and they have many benefits in the future
 unhone shodh main paaya ki maa kaa doodh ijief-1 hormone or rakt main insulin kii briddhi ko kam karata he or yah tab bhi is vruddhi ko kam karata he jab baccha thos aahaar lene lagata he

 daily mail ke anusaar jinati adhik avadhi tak stanpan baccha karegaa uskaa vajan 18 maah main utana hi kam hoga
 According to researcher Anja Lyke Madson, 'we can see that breastfeeding has a significant effect on the increase in blood IGF-1 and insulin
 jitna adhik baccha stanpan karegaa utana hi hormone kaa str kam hoga
 'studies suggest that breastfeeding will lead to lower obesity later on
 anusandhan main paaya gaya ki stanpan pet or seene main sankraman asthma or allergy se bachche ko bachaata he or aage ke jivan main use swasthya sambandhi kai laabh milte hai
 Not only this, the premature menstruation also protects the mother from breast and uterine cancer and bone diseases
 saath hi maa ko baccha janane ke baad uske sharir ko sahi aakaar dene main bhi madadgaar hota he kyonki yah pratidin atirikt 500 calories ko jalaata he
 Given these benefits, it has been suggested to breastfeed only for the first six months
 isse pehle ke anusandhan main paaya gaya tha ki formula doodh pine vaale tathaa chah maah se pehle thos aahaar lene vaale shishu teji se badhate hai
 Prof
 of Copenhagen University
 kim flechar michelson ke anusaar, ‘yah sarvavidit he ki jo bachche stanpan karte hai ve formula doodh lene waalon se kuch kam teji se badhate hai lekin baad ke jivan main ve jeevanstyli se judy bimariyon ke jokhim se bhi bache rahete hai
 "he said," but new results indicate that breastfeeding affects IGF-1 and insulin levels in nine months
 yah vahi samay he jab baccha thos aahaar lene yogya ho jaataa he
 The longer the baby lactates, the lower its weight will be in 18 months

 Chirag Paswan had announced to contest from Jamui, his wife does not want to contest, Bhai Pashupati is a minister in the Bihar government
 isliye ramvilas paas kii jagah koun legaa, is par kayaason kaa daur chalata rahaa
 Let us tell you that on Sunday, Vashistha Narayan Singh gave information about the seat-sharing by holding a press conference

 iske baad unhone dilli main faillepradooshan ke liedilli ke siem ko jimmedaar bataaya
 He said that Kejriwal is now showing himself to be the Victim, when pollution increased to such an extent
 lekin unhone pehle isko lekar koi kadam kyon nahin uthaaya
 Tiwari accused Kejriwal that he had not yet held any meeting with Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, even though he knew that there was a problem of pollution in Delhi this season
 tiwari ne bataaya ki unhone khud haryana ke siem khatter se phone par baat kii he or khatter ne unhen bataaya ki wo palaali jalaane kii samasya par dhyaan de rahe hai
 According to Manoj Tiwari, Khattar has assured them that the government will buy Palali at the rate of Rs 500 per tonne from the farmers and use it in the Waste to Energy plant

 unhone kaha, 'rajg ne bihar main aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar seat bantwaare ko antim rup de diya he par vipakshi dalon kaa mahagathbandhan abhi aakaar bhi nahin le sakaa he or ghatak dalon ke bich seat saajha to dur bihar main uske gathbandhan main koun-koun dal shaamil he yah bhi abhi spasht nahin
 Ram Vilas said that the Congress is involved in the grand alliance in Bihar but was excluded from the SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh

 Today that record is maintained, which is in the name of Shikhar Dhawan
 'gabbar' ke naam se jane jane vaale shikhar ne jab bhi shatak banaae hai, bharat match jeeta he
 The same thing happened today
 shikhar dhawan ne shandaar 137 ran kii pari kheli or bharat ne dakshin africa ke khilaaf yah match 130 ran se jeet liya
 It was the seventh century of Shikhar Dhawan's ODI career and the second against South Africa
 shikhar ne apane ekadivasiy kariyar kaa pehla shatak bhi dakshin africa ke khilaaf hi thoka tha
 This is Shikhar Dhawan's highest score in an ODI match, but today that record was broken, which was named for South Africa
 world cap main dakshin africa, bharat ke khilaaf teen baar toss haarane ke baad jeet kaa peechha karte hue match jeet chukaa tha
 Even today South Africa lost the match chasing a toss and 307 runs victory
 agar dekha jaae to toss jeetna bharat ke liye vardaan sabit hua
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni today captained superbly
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki gendbaaji menkamjor hone kii vajah se dhoni toss jeetne ke baat fielding kaa nirnay lenge, lekin dhoni ne apane bolors ke upar bharosa jataayaa or bolors ne bharosa tuutane nahin diya
 Dhoni used his bollars at the right time
 aaj bharat ke sabhi bolors shandaar bowling karte hue dakshin africa ballebaajon ko haaavee hone nahin diya
 In today's match, Mohammed Shami, Mohit Sharma and Umesh Yadav managed to stop the run rate in the bowling power play, while Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja managed to take wickets
 bharat ke liye jab bhi spinners ne 11 se 41 over ke bich do wicket liye, bharat vah match jeeta he
 But today, spinners bowling brilliantly took four wickets between 11 and 41 overs, including three wickets for Ashwin and one wicket for Jadeja
 lekin agar aankade ke najariye se dekha jaae, to 2011 se jeet kaa peechha karte hue dakshin africa kii jeet kaa pratishat sirf 34 ke kareeb rahaa he, jabaki pehle ballebaaji karte hue uske jeet kaa pratishat 75 ke kareeb he
 Today India's fielding was also fantastic
 abi divilliars kaa ran out hona match kaa terning point tha
 De Villiers, running in excellent form, was run out by Mohit Sharma on a personal score of 30 runs
 david miller jo dakshin africa ke sabase khatarnaak ballebaaj hai, vah bhi ran out hue
 Due to this the pressure on South Africa increased and his entire team was all out for only 170 runs
 aisa lagata he ki 7 number bharat ke liye shubh sabit hua
 Batting first, India scored 307, Shikar Dhawan hit 137, Ajinkya Rahane smashed a brilliant 79, which included 7 fours and South Africa were all out for 177
