 President Ram Nath Kovind approved the Citizenship Amendment Bill on Thursday night and now this law has come into force across the country
 assam sahit purvottar rajyon or sikkim ke logon kii apni alag-alag chintaae hai, jisaki vajah se naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke khilaaf log sadak par utarkar virodh-pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed to the youth of the Northeast for peace and said that you should trust this Modi
 aapaki parampara, bhashaa, rahan-sahan, samskruti or aapke haq par aanch nahin aane duungaa
 Despite this, why are the citizens of the Northeast so much displeased with the citizenship law
 asasam main naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke khilaaf ugr pradarshan jari hai
 All Assam Students Union activists, local artists, writers, intellectuals and people of opposition parties have been protesting in different ways
 is kanoon ko asamiya logon kii bhaawanaaon, hiton or assam samjhaute kaa ulanghan maan rahe hai
 The people of Assam are concerned that through this citizenship law, the government will save the illegal Hindu refugees from Bangladesh under NRC
 anya deshon ke logon ko yahaan basane se assam ke logon or unki bhashaa, samskruti or parampara ke nasht hone kaa khatra he
 The grant of citizenship to outsiders will also create a crisis on their livelihood
 darasal, assam main sthaneey banaam bahari kaa mudda hameshaa se prabhavi rahaa he, jiske liye assi ke dashak main chale andolan ke baad assam samjhauta banaaya gaya tha
 In the Assam Accord, the date of 24 March 1971 was considered as a cut-off and it was decided that by this time only those who came to Assam will be considered citizens
 jabaki nae kanoon ke tahat 31 disambar 2014 tak bharat main aae logon ko naagarikta dene kaa praavdhaan he
 However, the government has placed this law in the Sixth Schedule, under which citizenship will not be available in states with inner line permits
 iske tahat assam ke kuch jile aate hai
 Some areas of Tripuratripura fall under the Sixth Schedule, but the tribal-dominated state is strongly opposed to the Citizenship Amendment Act
 inamen sabase adhik virodh tripura tribal autonomas district council (titdisi) main ho rahaa he
 The biggest concern here is of tribal identity
 seemaa paar bangladesh se ghuspaith or bad jaaegi
 He argues that Tripura is the only state in the northeast where the tribal population has become a minority due to the large population coming from Bangladesh
 manipurnaagarikta kanoon aane se pehle manipur ke kuch chaatr sanghathanon ne virodh pradarshan shuru kar die the, lekin kendriya grahamantri amit shah ne loksabhaa main bill ko pesh karne se pehle kaha ki manipur ke logon kii bhaawanaaon ke dekhte hue manipur ko inner line permit (ialpi) main shaamil kiya gaya he
 After this, the Manipur People Against Cab (MANPAC) stopped their agitations, but people who settled there in connection with the business have also started worrying about being outsiders
 isi ke chalate manipur main kuch log virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Mizorammizoram is within the scope of the Inner Line Permit
 iske baavjood sthaneey log virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai
 They are worried that the introduction of this law will give legitimacy to Bangladeshi Chakma Buddhists who have come to Mizoram illegally
 saath hi yahaan ke log bru or riyang adivaasiyon ko kisi bhi surat main basaanaa nahin chaahate hai
 Naga Hoho, the Naga tribe of Nagaland, Nagaland is also against the citizenship amendment law
 jabaki, nagaland bhi inner line permit ke tahat aata he
 After this, the people of Nagaland are worried that this will affect the geographical location of the tribal states of the North East
 saath hi nagaaon main yah dar bhi he ki apravasi log naga ilaakon main bhi basenge
 Meghalaya comes under the Meghalaya Inner Line Permit, but in Shillong of the state itself, a large area of ten times ten square kilometers is called the European Ward
 yah chhathi anusuchee se baahar he
 The area is heavily populated and some areas have slums occupied by people from Bangladesh
 meghalaya ke logon kii ab yah chintaa he ki kanoon aane ke baad ye banguldeshi yahaan kii nagarkita le sakenge
 That is why they are protesting on the streets
 arunachal pradeshnagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke khilaaf assam dadhak rahaa he, to padosi hone ke naate arunachal pradesh bhi yah dard mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Arunachal Pradesh also comes under Inner Line Permit
 iske baad bhi arunachal pradesh students union (aapsu) is kanoon ke khilaaf sadak par virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai
 People here are against giving citizenship to people of Buddhist Chakma community in any case
 sikkimasikkim main bhi naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ko lekar virodh jari he
 Football player Baichung Bhutia's Hamro Sikkim Party is against this law
 bhutia kii chintaa he ki is kanoon ke kaaran himalayan rajya ko milane vaale vishesh praavdhaan kamjor padenge, jo samvidhan ke anuchhed 371 epa ke tahat hasil hai
 However the Sikkim government is in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act

 Gujarat government has told the Supreme Court that it will remove DGP PP Pandey, accused in Ishrat Jahan encounter case
 pandey ishrat jahaan maamle main sajeesh, apharan or hatya ke maamle main aaropee he
 The trial is currently going on in a special CBI court
 pandey centre sarkaar dwaara 30 april tak seva vistaar par chal rahe hai
 Pandey had filed a letter in the Supreme Court that he was ready to leave his post immediately
 gujarat sarkaarne bataaya ki peepi pandey khud pad chhodana chaahate hai or sarkaar ne unki is peshkash ko sweekaar kar liya hai
 PP Pandey, a 1980-batch IPS officer arrested in July 2013, is an accused in the Ishrat Jahan case and has also been in jail along with another accused IPS DG Vanzara
 vanjaaraa bhi philhal jamaanat par reeha hai
 In July 2013, CBI arrested PP Pandey in this case

 Shekhar Kapur (who later went on to become a Hollywood fame) made Hindi cinema the 90s in the 90s by making films like Bandit Queen, clearing the lanes of "mother-sister" and getting both abuse and clap from people

 Then in mainstream films like Sathya, female sexual abusive words came and were appreciated

 The "censor board" is only busy watching "smoke and animals" (sometimes religion and patriotism too)
 The journey started with "gangs of Wasseypur" and today is very violent like "mirzapur" and "dirty talk" and "mother-sister" -betty's abuses are synonymous with "obscenity

 Names like Honey Singh, Badshah are those "brands" that trade crores today and have got success at the cost of "women's insult" (and still getting from the Hinglish culture) altogether today Hindi Hindi music (and others In Indian languages too) there is a glut of "feminine-insult-indicative-words" in the mainstream

 as there was a "cholera epidemic" or famine until a century ago

 As a result, thousands of women have to suffer hell everyday

 keval "avasthaa" main bhinnata he
 The format is the same

 No matter how mechanical we do it becomes a place of "female violence" in our mind
 upyukt-avasar milane par kis daitya sa hamaare naitik-aavaran ko faad kar baahar aa jaataa he
 Calling a girlfriend a "bitch" or a "hor" when it entered American bedrooms from American culture should also be examined by "moral-soldiers" who are often proud of raiding roses and love letters
 yaad rakhiye "samskruti jo janmane main sadiyaan kintu bhrasht hone main dashak bhar lagate hai"
 We have become very corrupt today
 "kamasutra" rachane vaale desh me "sex" kabhi "tabu" nahin tha, na itnaa manhagaa hi tha
 But the "sex" in this country was not even wild, it was very "sophisticated-performance"

 That is why the splendor of Khajuraho and Konark became the wonder of the entire West
 lekin aaj vahi "unmuktata" asaamaajik ho gai he
 Western sexual ambivalence is easily accepted! Remember Nirbhaya had said that he was abused and abused

 The rapist is not just committing physical violence, but in order to cheer himself up (because our consciousness does not cooperate in rape), he rapes the filthy abuser by resorting to filthy abuses (which he learned from this society and family)

 Today that "tribal culture" is over, but the "tribal-mentality" remains the same

 Therefore, simply assuming that "abuses" have taken the form of "idioms" or is a culture (maladministration) and it does not have a major impact, it is too expensive to ignore

 We can call it a fair of memoirs, in which all kinds of personalities, from far and near, familiar and unfamiliar, ordinary and extraordinary - are seen walking
 pathak is meley main bhatak na jaaen, isko dhyaan main rakhkar sampadak ne mela kshetra ko kai pranganon main baanta he jaise sahitya, dharohar, rangamanch, kala, sangeet-abhinay, raajnneeti, patrakarita, yatra or prasangvash
 There is also a court of contemplation
 in pranganon main aapaki bhent jin vyaktiyon se hoti he, unki vividhta chamatkrit karne vaali he
 The memoirs of this special issue are not of the same style or dhaba
 jitne rachanaakaar, utani hi sheliyaan
 The famous German thinker Buffon said that style is the true identity of a person
 is ukti main thodaa pherbadal kar kaha ja saktaa he ki sansmaran kii style hi sansmarankar kii sachhee pahchaan he
 By reading these memoirs of the plural, we easily understand whether the memoirist is a professor or a journalist, a stage director or a musician

 It is not that the coordinator of the special case does not believe this
 aisa hota to mahadevi verma kaa chini pheriwala jaisaa sansmaran isamen shaayad hi hota
 Harishankar Parsai used to say, "I should not write memoirs on the rickshawman who has carried me on my rickshaw for years
 " vaaki
 i was surprised to see that there are many who write memoirs in Hindi but very few who write on the theology of memoirs
 lagbhag nahin
 Only the unknowable has discussed what should happen in the memoirs of Schjell in his life

 Memoirs are readable, they are interesting, it is also undeniable
 sabhi maanate hai ki pathakapriyata sansmaranon kii pehali kasuti he
 Memoirs have outnumbered other prose genres of literature in the last one and a half decades
 ab hindi kshetra kaa koi nagar yaa kasbaa nahin he, jahaan do-chaar sansmarankar na mil jaaen
 Renowned memoirist and editor Ravindra Kalia used to say that the reader now finds the first memoir in newspapers and magazines

 Divided into two ghat sections like Samay Ghat and Simaria Ghat, this collection has a total of 69 poems, which carry different motifs like the diversity of the Ghats, but as the different motifs of each ghat eventually carry a cultural flow, so poems also have a continuous and constant cultural flux and she-movements that are willing to do in life to get up and realization of the waves, which Ramaj a half poet of Tra Nick heals gesture
 thik ganga kii tarah hi in kavitaaon ko ek karne vaali jo naveen tarang, bhangimaayein hai, ve kavi ko ek alag vyaktitv detii hai
 The first poem of the collection is - Paddy in Poetry, in which the poet says i am paddy / raised on paper / of new poet / in poetry
 dhan na to patharilii jameen par ugta he or na hi oosar main
 It rises in the moist region of the earth
 kavi agar kaagaj par uga rahaa he to nishchay hi yah kaagaj shushk na hokar bhigaa hua he
 It is soft rather than rigid, but flexible rather than hard
 kaagaj par nami kaa yah bodh kavi kii chitwan ko ek taraf ardra banaata he to duusari taraf ullasit
 The sense of human compassion that these two express together, connects the poet with Valmiki's fevered psyche on the one hand and Kabir's strident fakism on the other
 isi kaaran yah sangrah dhan ke bhaat banane ke avarodhi tatwon kii sakht mimasaa bhi karata he
 There are many poems in the collection such as Vidarbha, Khet, Sevagram, weavers, chowkidars, hunger, Basmati songs, Manjhi which give the poet a pervasive sense of pity with his pervasive social discomfort

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Tara Chandra gets the stamp of 'certified Tailor' but does not hide her nervousness and distress about it
 tara chandra ke naam ke saath ye ‘hunar’ silaai ke lietrainingcentre main naam likhaae bina, kabhi vahaan jaae bina hi jud gaya
 The training center which is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's much publicized program 'skill India' launched on 15 July 2015
 kapadaa mantralay kii ekikrut kaushal vikaas yojana (ISDS) kaa record bataata he ki tara chandra ne sonipat sthit modern ajukeshan socity main silaai kaa hunar siikhaa
 For this, Tara Chandra was also issued a certificate on September 13, whose number is 17210867803
 tara chandra kaa kahana he, “maine silaai yaa kasheedakaari (ambrydari) kii kabhi koi training nahin lee
 i attended a seven-day workshop for mason work but never went to the Banda Training Center
 main kapade silana (tailoring) nahin jaanata
 In the name of 'skill India', middlemen have been investigated by the fraudsters India Today that Tara Chandra is not the only one who was cheated by middlemen in the name of the center's flagship program

 Rakesh says, "I work for the living

 “another beneficiary of Skill India’s name is Anita Devi

 Anita Devi does not know anything about certificate number 17210867810 issued on 23 September 2017
 anita devi kahati hai, “wo hamaari sari jaankaree le gaye
 But no one told us where and when to train

 i could also work and earn some money
 ”skill india kaa ye he maksadaskill india main mantralayon, gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon (ngos), nijee hitdharakon ko is lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye saath joda gaya ki desh main hunarmandon kii kami ko dur kiya ja sake
 For this, a way was chosen to trend people under the public-private partnership model
 har prashikshu ke liye 10,000 rupye kii sweekrut raashi main se partner agenciyaan 75 fisadi sarkari sabsidi paane kii hakdaar hai
 But middlemen are directly using the information like Aadhaar number of people and project them like beneficiaries of Skill India
 banda kii atarra tehsil se bhi aisi hi tasviir saamne aati he
 Ramanuja, an officially certified tailor under ISDS, says, "chedilal (middleman) took away my Aadhaar card saying that i would get my job after training
 teen maheene baad mujhe pataa chalaa ki training to ho bhi chuki he or mere naam kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 Ramanuja's certificate number is 17130665810
 is praaanpatr ke mutabik ramanuj ne pune sthit maharashtra academy of ejineering or ajukational research (MAEER) se 2016 main training lee
 The co-ordinating officer of MAEER Mahesh Deshpande dismisses the open misuse of Skill India as a mere 'misunderstanding'
 deshpandey kehete hai- “nahin, nahin, jarur kahin koi galatfahami hui he
 Students who apply for training can appear in the exam, the ministry assesses them
 aadhaar card se samanvay ke hisaab se praaanpatr taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 After that, certificates are issued by the Ministry

 jawaab main bataaya gaya: 146 mahilaayein unke enjio main pehle hi training le chuki hai
 Of these, 95 have been appointed! However neither the trainees got certificates nor did Ruby get any payment for conducting the training
 lekin artiai se mili jawaab ne ye dikhaaya ki modern ajukeshan socity ko vibhinn jagahon par ISDS corson ko chalaane ke badale 1
 a rough payment of Rs 12 crore was made
 20 varsh ke aasapaas kii shabnam ne enjio main khud ko enrol karaayaa tha

 It is generally believed that Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, was opposed to science technology and mechanization
 lekin naye adhyayanon main yah baat saamne aa rahi he ki is yugadrushtaa ne apane ‘khaadi’ or ‘charkha’ andolanon ke jariye jin sapanom ko puraa karne kii koshish kii, aaj internet unhen saakaar kar rahaa he
 This fact is well established in the soon-to-be-released book 'music of the Spinning Wheel' by Sudhindra Kulkarni, an advisor and thinker of senior BJP leader LK Advani
 pustak main tamaam bade vaigyanikon, prodyogikividon, chintakon or samaajavigyaniyon ke vichaaron ke hawaale se yah sthapit karne kii koshish kii gayi he ki internet or vaishvikaran ke is daur main gandhi ke vichaar or bhi praasangik ho gayi hai

 In the book, an attempt has been made to see the life and mission of Mahatma Gandhi in a holistic manner through the spectacles of all the possibilities and dangers of today's Internet era
 kulkarni ke anusaar gandhi sahitya main sambhavat: aisa pehali baar hua he ki is pustak ke jariye internet kii ascharyajanak sambhaavnaaon or charkha andolan ke naitik sandeshon ke bich aapasi sambandh talashne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 The book attempts to highlight Mahatma Gandhi's attitude towards every aspect of life
 in kshetron main arthshaastra se lekar shiksha, prakritik upachaar se lekar paryaavaran sangrakshan, sex se lekar mahila shashaktikaran tathaa raajnneeti se lekar shanti sthapana tak vibhinn kshetron ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 It is generally believed that Mahatma Gandhi was against modern science, but according to this book of Kulkarni, Gandhi was a person of 'scientific consciousness'
 unhone adarsh samaaj ke bare main apane drushtikon tathaa apane vyaavhaarik prayogon main vigyaan ko mahatvapurn sthaan diya
 According to Kulkarni, 'the main lesson of Gandhi's Charkha movement was that this technology should empower the common man
 saath hi yah samaaj par badhyakaari ho jisase kisi bade lakshya ko hasil kiya ja sake
 Both these things stand on the Internet
 ' mahatma gandhi apane jivan kaal main charakhe kii upyogita ko lekar tamaam sawaalon se jujhate rahe

 jail main band dramuk saansad kanimoi ne dilli kii ek adaalat ko bataaya ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh or tatkaaleen vittamantri pi
 Chidambaram was fully aware of the allocation of 2-G spectrum licenses and decided not to auction them along with the then Telecom Minister a Raja
 kanimoi kii ore se apil karte hue varisht adhivaktaa susheel kumaar ne sibiai ke vishesh nyaayadhish opi saini se kaha, main aapako baithak kaa byora uplabdh kara rahaa hum jisamen pradhanmantri manmohan singh tatkaaleen vitt mantri or doorsanchaar mantri ne faisla kiya ki 2ji spectrum ke licenson kii bikri yaa nilaamee nahin kii jaaegi
 Seeking the discharge of the case, the counsel for the 43-year-old DMK MP said that the CBI case was based on the fact that the accused caused huge losses to the state exchequer by not auctioning licenses for 2-G spectrum
 kumaar ne kaha, pradhanmantri tatkaaleen vitt mantri or vartmaan doorsanchaar mantri gavaahon ke rup main yah sabit karne ke liye sahi vyakti hai ki koi nuksaan nahin hua
 He said in Parliament that there was no loss
 yah jodate hue ki sibaai kaa maamla jis baat par tikaa he usase kanoonee prakriya nahin banati kumaar ne kaha, yadi nuksaan nahin hua to dhokhadhadi kaa aarope bhi nahin banataa
 The defense counsel also called the CBI and the inspector general and auditor's assessment of the loss baseless and said that these cannot be the basis for prosecuting the accused
 vakil ne kaha kaig report (sarkari khajaane ko 1
 76 lakh crore loss) was placed before the House on 16 November 2010
 ise sadan ne sweekaar nahin kiya tha
 It is still uncertain whether the House will accept the report
 kanimoi ke vakil ne sibiai ke 30 hajaar 984 karod rupee ke nuksaan ke akalan par bhi sawaal khadey kiye or kaha ki iskaa bhi koi aadhaar nahin he kyonki aarope patr main kaha gaya he licenson kii nilaamee kar sarkaar adhik kamai kar sakati thi
 The defense counsel said that these words cannot be the basis of the case as the appropriate paragraph in the charge sheet is a complete myth
 unhone tark diya swaan telecom privet limited or unitech wireles (tamilnadu privet limited) donon ghotaale kii kathith labhaarthi dwaara videshi companiyon kramash: etisalaat or telenor ko sheyaron kii bikri ko sarkaar dwaara manjuuri di gai thi
 This was not a sale of licenses and hence no loss
 dramuk pramukh em karunanidhi kii beti kii ore se pesh vakil ne poocha bikri kahaan hui (licenson kii) ? dhokhadhadi kahaan hui ? kanimoi ko sibiai ne ghotaale main unki kathith bhoomika ke liye 30 may ko giraftaar kiya tha
 His arguments are still on in protest against allegations of corruption and fraud and criminal conspiracy in the 2-G case
 kanimoi khud ko aarope mukt karne ke liye usee tarah ke tark de rahi hai jaise ki purv doorsanchaar mantri e raja ne die the 
 He too sought to drag the Prime Minister and Chidambaram into the matter, saying that the issue of dilution of stake by spectrum license holders was discussed with them
 gurugram ke reyaan skool main duusari kaksha main padhane vaale pradhyumna kii hatya ke aaropee juvenil kii nyaayik hiraasat 30 janvari tak badha di gai he
 Earlier on January 7, the bail plea of the accused was dismissed

 Joginder Singh Cairo prepared a psychological report after spending five hours with the accused
 sibiai ne is cese kii jaanch haath main lene ke baad cese ko nayaa mode dete hue juvenil ko pradhyumna kii hatya kaa aaropee banaaya gaya tha
 Earlier, Gurugram police arrested the school bus conductor Ashok Kumar as the main accused in this case
 lekin sibiai ne apane haath main jaanch lete hi cese ko nayaa mode de diya or juvenil ko mukhya aaropee banaaya
 No evidence was found against Ashoka
 is vakt ashok kumaar jamaanat par reeha he
 Let it be said that the father of the deceased was a petition before the Juvenile Justice Board that a case should be taken against the accused as adult
 usne jaghanya aparaadh kiya he
 Such crimes can only be perpetrated by perverted and adult mentality, in which case the court should consider it as adult and clear the way for maximum punishment

 (input from IANS) ditisi bason main conductor ko bas ke andar gum kar yatriyon se paise vasuul karte hue tikat dena chahie yaa phir seat par baithe conductor se yatriyon ko hi paise dekar apana tikat lenaa chahie? yah aisa sawaal tha jis par dilli hoicourt main yachika daali gai or sunwaayee karke court ne is yachika kaa nipataara kar diya he
 In the hearing, the Delhi government was asked to file a reply in this matter
 dilli sarkaar ne hoicourt ko bataaya ki usne cluster bason main conduktaron ko yatriyon ke paas jaakar kiraaya lenaa anivaary kar diya he, lekin dilli parivahan nigam (ditisi) kii bason main ye shart anivaary nahin he
 This is also in agreement with the cluster buses
 un bason main conduktaron ko yatriyon ke paas jaakar kiraaya ekatra karnaa he or unhen tikat dena he
 It is not possible to decide such a rule - courtdtc also said that its conductors do not move in the bus to collect fare from passengers and give them tickets
 dilli sarkaar or ditisi kii daleelon ko sunne ke baad court ne kaha ki aisa koi thos niyam tay karnaa sambhav nahin he jisamen ye tay kiya ja sake ki conductor har yatri ke paas jaae or usase kiraaya lekar tikat de
 The DTC said that it was not in favor of issuing any directive to conductors to collect fares and give tickets
 hoicourt ne yah kehete hue conduktaron ko bas main gum-ghumkar kiraaya vasuulne kaa nirdesh dene kii maang karne vaali yachika kaa nipataara kar diya
 The Delhi High Court had on 16 January sought a response from the Delhi government and the DTC in this matter
 yachika main court se kaha gaya tha ki sarkaar or bas maalikon ke qaraar main conductor ke gum-gum kar tikat kaatane kii baat kahi gai he
 Despite this, the conductor keeps on cutting the ticket in one place
 sarkaar niyam banaakar sunishchit kare ki conductor gum-gum kar tikat kaate
 The petitioner's lawyer Jose Abraham told the court that despite the agreement, the conductors do not cut the ticket by moving from one end of the bus to the other end and sit on their seat and cut the ticket
 is kaaran duusare rajyon se dilli aane vaale log aksar bheed main tikat nahin le pate hai or phir unhen jurmaana bharna padataa he
 He said that people of other states do not know whether to go to the conductor and get a ticket
 is vajah se vah tikat nahin le paata he or use jurmaana bharna padataa he
 Lawyer Jose Abraham said that this causes great problems for the elderly, women with children and the disabled
 kyonki unhen bheed main bas ke ek chor se duusare chor jaakar tikat lenaa padataa he
 While in other states, conductors go to all the passengers and give tickets, then why is it not so in Delhi
 conductor apane seat par baitha rahata he or yatri uske paas aakar tikat lete hai
 Keeping this in mind, the court should direct the government to ask the conductors to ensure that all the passengers are allowed to turn around
 Maha Shivaratri 2019: mahashivaratri kaa parv dastak dene vaala he

 aisi manyata he ki isi mandir main yudhisthir ne ashwamedh yajna karavaaya tha
 Due to its history, a large number of devotees come here on the occasion of Maha Shivaratri to fulfill their wishes
 bhaajapa adhyaksh tathaa grahamantri amit shah maharashtra main bhale hi bhaajapa kii sarkaar banane main vifal ho gaye lekin sarkaar banane kii siyasat rukii nahin he
 The party is hopeful that the Shiv sena-congress-ncp alliance will soon start a ruckus and the mlas deprived of the post will not hesitate to change Pala
 mukhyamantri uddhav thakare ne jis din vidhansabha main bahumat hasil kiya usee din bahes ke dauraan bhaajapa ke chandrakant patil ne kaha tha ki, denvedra fadanvis zyada din vipaksh main nahin baithenge or vah mukhyamantri banenge
 BJP sources say that Patil's statement is not unintentional
 darasal, patil ne yah bayaan bhaajapa kii bhavi ranneeti ke maddenjar diya
 Patil's statement got a boost when NCP chief Sharad Pawar said in an interview to a Marathi TV channel that, during Modi's meeting with the PM in Parliament, it was said on behalf of Modi that in Maharashtra, we can work together Huh
 haalanki, pavaar ne kaha ki unhone isse inkaar kar diya lekin pavaar ke is bayaan se yah to saaf ho hi gaya ki, bhaajapa ne sarkaar banane ke liye ensipi kaa saath lene kaa vikalp khulaa rakhaa he
 a Maharashtra BJP leader says that the party is not going to do anything in a hurry
 alabatta yah baat sahi he ki party ke paas sarkaar banane ke vikalp hai
 just a matter of time
 bhaajapa wet and vaach kii niti par chal rahi he
 Chandrakant Patil says that the BJP is not manipulating, nor will it
 lekin yadi kisi bhi party kaa koi netaa bhaajapa main aana chahta he to party us par vichaar karegi
 After all, the mlas of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress know that this government is against the parent
 bhaajapa ke ek kendriya netaa kehete hai ki, karnataka kaa udhaaharan sabake saamne he
 The BJP had got a mandate in the state but the Congress went with the JDS and formed a government defying the mandate
 kuch hi dinon baad sarkaar dagamagane lagi
 The mlas of both the parties started leaving the party and went down in support of the BJP
 jiske baad up-chunaav kii sthiti ban gai
 The BJP was a big success in Karnataka when the by-elections were held and people gave an absolute majority to the BJP for a stable government
 maharashtra ke log jaanate hai ki shivasena-ensipi-congress kii sarkaar aapasi hit ke liye ek saath ai he jis din hit kaa takaraav shuru hoga gathbandhan tuutane main der nahin hogi
 BJP sources say that the Shiv-soldiers who have been fighting against the Congress and NCP for years are disappointed in their hearts
 gathbandhan kii vajah se sarkaar bachaane ke liye uddhav ko samjhauta karnaa hi hoga isse shiv sainikon kii naaraazgi or badhegi or aise main kaaphi sankhya main vidhayak or party padaadhikari shiv-sena kaa daaman chhodane main der nahin karenge
 a senior BJP leader says that ideologically opposed governments of each other do not last long
 jammu-kashmir main bhaajapa ne jab pidipi ke saath sarkaar banaai to vah bahut dinon tak nahin chal saki
 Similarly, when Nitish Kumar formed a government with Lalu Yadav in Bihar, the government could not run even after a large majority
 maharashtra main to shivasena, ensipi or congress donon se lard kar is mukaam tak ai he
 Now how long the government formed with his support will last

 Input: IANS shivasena saansad anil desai ko ravivaar ek asahaj sthiti se do-chaar hona padaa
 On Sunday morning, Anil Desai got a call from Matoshree that he had to go to Delhi to take oath as a cabinet minister
 isse thik ek din pehle desai ne patrakaron ko bataaya tha ki wo dilli nahin jaaenge
 Eventually Desai went to Delhi but left for Mumbai back from the airport itself
 shivasena ke sutron ke anusaar ravivaar subah shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke paas bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kaa phone aayaa
 It is being told that after talking to Shah, Uddhav asked Desai to leave for Delhi

 Desai also left for Delhi with his wife on Sunday morning, but the whole incident changed abruptly and Desai was asked to stay at the Delhi airport itself
 thakare ne bhi patrakaron se baat karte hue yah baat maani ki unhone desai ko shapath grahan main jane se roka tha
 In fact, BJP told Shiv Sena that Anil Desai will be made Minister of State
 iske chah maheene baad shivasena ko ek or rajyamantri kaa pad diya jayega
 Even the talk seemed to be building, but the Shiv Sena chief was most hurt by the decision to make Suresh Prabhu, former Shiv Sena MP a cabinet minister
 bijepi ne haalanki shivasena ko kaha tha ki prabhu ko shivasena ke cote se baahar rakhkar mantrimandal main shaamil kar rahe hai, lekin jis tarah se shivasena ko bataae bina prabhu ne party kii sadsyta chodi or bijepi main shaamil hue isse thakare ko bahut chot pahunchi
 Significantly, Suresh Prabhu, who was made the railway minister, left Shiv Sena on the same day of swearing in and took BJP membership
 is maamle ne packp kii ore bad rahe shivasena-bijepi gathbandhan ko phir se brallep ke kareeb laa diya

 The Shiv Sena hoped that Modi would try to appease the Shiv Sena through cabinet expansion

 Meanwhile, Anil Desai was waiting for the next order from Matoshree at Delhi Airport
 aadesh aayaa ki unhen waapas mumbai lautnaa he
 At the Mumbai airport, Shiv Sena supporters welcomed Desai
 desai ke chehre par thakaan or khij ek saath najar aa rahi thi
 Desai told reporters, 'I had gone only to keep Uddhav ji's talk and respect the bjp's control but when he did not listen to us, there was no point in going there

 In Haridwar, Uttarakhand, Ardh Kumbh, which started in the midst of half-finished preparations, incomplete construction works and the displeasure of the saints, is telling a living story of the failure of the administration and the state government
 1 janvari ko mela prashasan ne ganga pujan ke saath adrdhakumbh kii shuruyaat kii ghoshnaa to kar di lekin is aayojan ke pramukh paatr sadhu-santon ko isamen bulaane kii jahamat tak nahin uthaai gai
 Nor was there any big ritual on this occasion
 adrdhakumbh ke liye mela kshetra main 273 nirmaan prastaavit kiye gaye the
 Of these, only 106 works have been completed
 shesh kaamon ko puraa karne ke liye khud mukhyamantri harish ravat ne taarikh 31 janvari tak badha di he
 With only one bath in January, the number of saints and saints along with devotees is not much at present
 lekin jaise-jaise din aage badhenge, khaas taur se farvari main jab teen snaan honge, ardhakumbh main bheed bhi badhati jaaegi or prashasan kii adhuri taiyaariyaan kai museebaton ko bulaava dengi
 The construction of Laltaro Bridge and Lalpul with the aim of organizing the crowd of devotees has not been completed yet
 meley ke sabase ahm product hill bypass kaa nirmaan bhi adhuraa he
 However, Chief Minister Rawat has taken steps to reduce the resentment of the saints and saints and instructed them to hold rituals on January 12 and call all the organizations associated with Kumbh, including saints and saints
 meley ko safal banane ke liye or shraddhaluon kii zyada se zyada bheed jutaney ke liye meley kii website bhi launch kar di he
 The administration hopes that more than 5 crore devotees can come to attend the fair
 aatanki khatre kaa andeshabharat main aatankwaadi khatre ke maddenjar mela sthal ko kaaphi samvedansheel mana ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the government is busy in making strong security arrangements, but many arrangements are still incomplete
 132 varg kilometre main faile or 32 sectoron tathaa nau jone main vibhajit kumbh kshetra main drone camaron se nigahabaani to hogi hi, sisitivi camere bhi chappe-chappe par lagaae ja rahe hai
 More than ten thousand police and paramilitary forces will be deployed in the security of the area
 inke alaava snifer dog squad ko kaam par laga diya gaya he or combing bhi shuru kar di gai he
 "in view of the terrorist attack on the Pathankot airbase and the arrest of an ISI agent from Meerut, the fair police does not want any reduction in security arrangements," says Mela Deputy Inspector General Ganesh Singh Mertolia
 paramilitary force kii 15 companiyon main se nau haridwar aa chuki hai jabaki baaki makar sankranti se pehle hi pahunch jaaengi
 32 police stations are also to be set up in the fair area
 mela avadhi main bijli or pani kii aapurti nirbaadh rahe isaki monitering ke liye police ke aalaa adhikariyon ko jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 During the fair, wild animals and monkeys are not born, so the forest department has also been asked to be vigilant
 mukhyamantri ne meley kii suraksha ko lekar lagaataar reharsal karne ke nirdesh bhi die hai
 The state government also plans to bring rural deities from all the villages of the state to Haridwar for Kumbh Snan and preparations have been started for this
 aadhunik suraksha intjammartolia ke mutabik, mela kshetra main bam remote se udaane kii divaais ko niskriy karne kaa bhi intjaam kiya gaya he
 For this, portable jammers have been installed at various places
 pichley anubhav se sabak lete hue is baar kumbh kshetra main 28 fire stesan bhi banaae ja rahe hai
 It is worth noting that during the last Ardh Kumbh in 2010, there were about one hundred and fifty incidents of fire in the fair area
 prashasan apane str par suraksha main koi kami nahin rakhana chahta isliye kumbh kshetra main bam niskriy karne ke liye das bam dyspojal skiwad bhi tainaat kiye gaye hai
 With the help of 70 CCTV cameras and three drones, the entire area will be monitored instantly
 vaahanon par najar rakhane ke liye chaar automatic number plate rikgnishan system bhi sthapit kiye ja rahe hai
 Shortage of funds Chief Minister Harish Rawat has alleged that the Center has not allocated funds for Haridwar Ardh Kumbh despite repeated requests from the state government
 haridwar sthit matra sadan ke swami shivanand ne bhi adrdhakumbh aayojan ko lekar apanaae ja rahe centre ke ravaie kii aalochana karte hue kaha, ''centre sarkaar ko is mahatvapurn aayojan ke liye dhan uplabdh karana chahie
 He should not do politics in this
 ''paise kii kami is mahaaayojan ko prabhavit na kar sake, isliye ravat ne nayaa upaay khoja he
 Rawat has proposed that whatever industrial houses will help in various activities related to Kumbh celebrations, the names of bridges and roads will be named after their families
 hinduja samooh ne ardhakumbh main ek aspataal kaa nirmaan karaane kaa elaan bhi kar diya he or badale main ravat ne adrdhakumbh main banaae gaye ek pul kaa naam hinduja bandhuon kii mata janaki devi ke naam par rakhane kaa elaan kiya he
 The Ardhakumbh fair, held every six years, has started from January and will continue till April
 isamen kul das snaan honge, jinamein se pehla snaan makar sankranti ke din 14 janvari ko hoga or dasvaan yani antim snaan 22 april ko hoga

 rajya ke paryaavaran sangrakshan or pradooshan niyantran board hotalon, dharmashalaon or ashramon par najar banaae hue hai, jabaki rishikesh se haridwar tak ganga kii vishesh monitering kii jimmedaari paryaavaran pradooshan board kii he
 Aamir Khan has done various roles in films so far
 vah maanate hai ki paison se zyada jaruri filmon se bhaavnaatmak judaav he
 Aamir Khan, one of Bollywood's favorite Khans, claims that he takes less wages than other actors
 unka kahana he ki vah apni bhaawanaaon ke saath samjhauta nahin kar sakate or rupayon se unhen kharida nahin ja saktaa
 Aamir said, 'till date i have not worked for money and that is my great strength
 ' aamir ne apni haalia pradarshit film 'dhooma3' kii safalataa ke liye darshakon kaa dhanyavad bhi kiya
 Aamir has always experimented with films, characters and genres throughout his 25-year film career
 ek premi se lekar shikshak, gaanv ke yuvak or ab ek khalanaayak tak ke kirdaar aamir nibhaa chuke hai
 The biggest thing for Aamir is his emotional involvement with his films, only then does he give his consent to the film
 aamir ne kaha, 'aisa nahin he ki mujhe paison kii jarurat nahin he
 We all need money and according to me i get the least amount of wages
 kam se kam dusron kii tulana main main bahut kam kamata hum, lekin phir bhi main khush hum kyonki main vahi karata hum, jo meraa dil kahata he
 Aamir made a mark of his acting in films like 'dil Chahta Hai', Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander, 'hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke', 'raja Hindustani' and 'sarfarosh'
 saal 2001 aamir ke kariyar kaa mahatvapurn mode tha jab unhone 'lagaan' or 'dil chahta he' main kaam kiya tha
 After that Aamir worked in 'rang De Basanti' 'fana' 'ghajini' 'three Idiots' and 'dhobi Ghat'
 2007 main ai film 'taare jameen par' kaa nirdesan or usamen abhinay bhi kiya
 There is no doubt that Aamir is known and appreciated for making a film on a particular issue and subject
 nai dilli main congress mukhyalay main 2 april ko party kaa ghoshnaptr jari karte hue, purv vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram promised that if the party had a chance to form the next government, it would work for both the 'prosperity and welfare' goals of the voters
 chidambaram ne ghoshnaptr taiyaar karne vaali samiti kaa netritv kiya he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dismissed the manifesto as impractical
 lekin chunaavon ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bad-chadh kar bolne kii chhavi ko dekhte hue sambhaavna he ki un par amal main na aa paane vaali ghoshnaaon kaa elaan karne kaa aarope lagegaa
 Congress' justice (minimum income scheme) is a major consideration
 usamen yah sunishchit karne kii baat he ki desh ke kisi bhi ghar kii masik aay 6,000 rupye se kam nahin hogi
 In this way, about 5 crore families will be eligible for cash transfer of about 72,000 rupees annually
 isse sarkari khajaane par kareeb 3
 6 lakh crore Rs
 kaa bhaar padegaa or yah bharat ke vartmaan sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) kaa do fisad ke baraabar he
 The manner in which the payment will be made has not been fully explained in the manifesto
 haalanki yah ek ghoshnaptr bhar he, bajet nahin
 The Congress has also prepared a roadmap for this and the plan will take a year
 isamen isko dizin karnaa or pareekshan aadi shaamil hai
 After this the scheme will be launched and implemented in several phases
 congress kaa maananaa he ki pehle saal main nyaay kii laagat jidipi ke ek pratishat se bhi kam rahegi or duusare saal main is par do fisad se bhi kam kharch hoga
 As India's GDP increases, more and more families will move out of the poverty line, the cost of justice will decrease in proportion to GDP
 congress ke is dastavej main kaha gaya he, ''agar mumbai or ahmedabad ke bich bullate train ke liye bhaajapa 1 lakh karod ru
 Can not invest more than Rs, can not be given a fraction of its GDP to ensure social justice? 
 bhartiya rigerv bank ke purv governor raghuram rajan ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main sweekaar kiya ki unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se nyaay ke vishay main baat kii he
 He said that this scheme is an important step towards making the society more inclusive
 rajan philhal chicago vishvavidhyalay ke ek pratishthit bijness skool main padhaate hai
 Describing the scheme as 'remarkable', he said that it will enable even the poorest Indian to contribute to the economy
 yah ghoshnaptr un matadaataaon ko bharosa dilaane kaa ek prayaas he, jinhone modi sarkaar main khud ko upekshit mahasoos kiya
 The Congress wants to show that under its government the scope of economic development will be very wide
 congress ne desh ke vikaas ke liye bhaajapa ke soch se ek alag drushtikon prastut karne ke liye apane agenda ko chah mukhya vishyon main vibhajit kiya he—kaam (rojgaar), daam (aarthik vikaas jo sabhi ko lakshya karata ho), shaan (bharat kii naram or kathor shakti par garv), sushasan (swatantra, javabdeh or majboot sansthaanon ke madhyam se sushasan), swabhimaan (aarthik rup se vanchiton ke liye atmasamman) or sammaan (sabhi ke liye sammaan kaa jivan)
 In fact, in the manifesto of the Congress, there has been an attempt to show that where the BJP talks about partition, the Congress talks about taking everyone together in the thread of unity
 jaisi ki ummid thi, vitt mantri arun jetali samet sabhi bhaajapa netaaon ne ek sur main is ghoshnaptr ko 'khatarnaak' bataa diya
 The Congress has promised that it will abolish the sedition law, which the government often uses to silence its voice of criticism, instead of preventing actual treason
 usne kashmir or kai purvottar rajyon main sashastr balon ko vishesh adhikaar dene vaale sashastr bal visheshadhikaar adhinium (eexspie) kii samiksha kaa bhi vaada kiya he
 This law has long been criticized as a violation of human rights
 kashmir or kai purvottar rajyon main eexspie ahm mudda he
 The Congress says that economic relief is only one part of its larger agenda
 party kaa daawa he ki bhaajapa ne deshbhar main jis kathith bhay ke maahaul ko utpann kiya he, vah us maahaul se mukti dilaaegi
 It remains to be seen how the Congress can convince voters that it is fully serious about the promises made in the manifesto and will implement them

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Hakim and rulers wage war by showing Awam a dream of a golden future
 jang thamati he to koi jeetne kii khushrahmi main duba rahata he, to koi haarane ke gam main
 Whereas the truth is that life always loses in the war
 par syria main to haakim bhi apana, mulk bhi apana or avam bhi apni
 Nevertheless, his own ruler hurled poison at the people of his own country in such a way that in a moment more than a hundred people were killed
 ham baat kar rahe hai syria main hue rasinic hamale kii
 Chemical attackers in Syria, giving smiles to killers is also no less than a prayer
 par jab saanse kaatil ban jaae to kilkaariyaan goonjati nahin balki ghut jaati hai
 And the same happened with a Syrian city
 sara shahar so kar bas uthaa hi tha
 a rocket slowly entered the city's sky
 rocket jameen par gira
 Gas came out of the rocket and then on seeing it, the breath of the people dissolved in such a way that hundreds of breaths stopped
 ye tha syria main rasinic hathiyaar kaa hamalaa
 Which was carried out by rocket
 aasmaan se barsi maut kii aftinsaaniyat kii taarikh ne aasmaan se barsi maut kaa aisa khaufnak manzar dekha ki bas dekhne waalon kii ruh kaanp uthi
 The most dangerous and lethal weapon made by humans was being tried on humans and the trial was such that the corpses were piled up within minutes
 aasmaan se jo afat barsi, wo ek jatke main sau se zyada logon ko kab nigal gai kisi ko pataa hi nahin chalaa
 The world once again saw the dreaded face of the chemical bomb
 bacchon par barasaa maut kaa kaharasman se barsi is sabase khaufnak maut ko barasaane kaa hukum kisi or ne nahin balki syria ke raashtrapati ne khud diya tha
 In this world made by humans, their own leader was giving the order to drop this dreaded weapon, or chemical bomb, made by humans at their own people
 lekin is chemical atake kaa sabase aasaan shikaar hue wo chote-chote bachche, jinhone abhi bado kii is duniya main qadam rakhaa hi tha
 The children started having difficulty in breathing and fainted wherever they were
 pehle dam ghuta or phir khun kii ultiyaan hone lagi or chand minuton ke andar hi saanson kii door tuutane lagi
 Hospitals were full of helpless and sick people
 bacchon ko doctorl taur-tareeqon se saans dene kii koshish shuru kii gai
 But no one could force this deadly gas
 rasinic hamale ke liye jimmedaar kunkuch logon ne gas kii tapish kam karne ke liye thande pani kaa sahaara liya
 Which brought immediate relief, but life was scarce
 syria main maanavadhikaron ke liye kaam karne vaale sanghathanon ke saath america kii maane to is hamale ke peeche koi or nahin balki khud syria ke raashtrapati bashar al asad hi hai
 However, the Russians themselves, who attacked the rebels in favor of the Syrian army as well as their president Bashar al-assad, rejected these accusations outright
 balki rus ne ek bayaan jari kar ye khulaasa kiya ki hamalaa beshak syrian fuj ne hi kiya, lekin ye rasaynic hamalaa nahin tha
 Rather, the military's missile mine fell into the largest warehouse of terrorists loaded with chemical weapons in Shikhaun, and the accident occurred
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki is hamale ke liye syrian fuj nahin, balki vidrohi or aatankwaadi zimmedaar hai
 The decree against Awam is that Syria is the largest chemical weapon in the world
 or syria kii avam philhal apane hi netaa ke khilaaf hi sadakon par he
 To crush the voice of the people on the same road, the leader of the same people has done poison work from the sky
 kya he rasinic hathiyaar
 Why is it so poisonous? kaise letaa he ye jaan
 And why chemical weapons were used on the Syrian people
 isaki puri kahani aapako baichaiyn karke rakh degi
 The attack this time in Syria in the middle east of Syria in the morning of death was different from all the recent attacks
 kyonki is hamale main naa to kisi kaa koon baha or naa hi koi zakhmi hua, lekin phir bhi shahar bhar main laashen bich gayi
 This was such a death, which reached Syria in the face of the wind, and passed ahead by laying corpses in the breath
 4 april 2017 kii subah qareeb saadhe gyaarah baje grihayuddh kii aag main jhulas rahe is mulk ne jab apni ankhen kholi, to hawa main ghulti maut unka intazaar kar rahi thi
 Here, one rocket after another led to several attacks on the towns, and there settlements began to be transformed into crematoriums
 begunaah or bekabar log til-til kar maut ke munh main jane lage
 Second creepy attack after 1980, what children, old and young
 is hamale ne kisi ko nahin bakhsha
 Before people could understand what is this matter, if someone's breath stopped, then there was darkness in front of someone's eyes
 kyonki ye hamalaa koi maamuli hamalaa nahin, balki 1980 ke baad duniya main hua ab tak kaa doosraa sabase kaufanaak rasaynic hamalaa tha
 The attack, which killed more than a hundred people
 yun hua rasaynic hamalasiria kii ek badi aabaadi vahaan ke raashtrapati bashar al asad ke khilaaf pichley lambey vaqt se sadakon par he lekin unhen raashtrapati ke virodh kii aisi qeemat chukaani padegi, ye kisi ne khwab main bhi nahin sochaa tha
 It is alleged that at the behest of the government, the army fired rockets equipped with poisonous gases in the middle of the city and in the blink of an eye the whole Khan Shekhaon created a furore
 saalon se sahi-galat kii jang main uljhe syria ke logon ke liye goli-baari or dhamaake koi nai baat nahin hai
 But what happened on Tuesday morning had never happened before
 logon ne abhi apana din shuru hi kiya tha ki tabhi rocket ke girane se nikali zahreeli gas ne unka dam ghontna shuru kar diya
 
 
 
 or phir ruk gai saansenis hamale kaa sabase pehla asar to yahi hua ki logon ko saans lene main dikkat hone lagi
 Darkness began to filter in front of the eyes due to intense burns, the pupils started getting smaller and most people died within ten minutes of death
 sabase bura haal to bacchon kaa hua, jo kuch samajhane se pehle hi duniya se rukhsat ho gaye
 Those who were in a better condition started to make the hospital available to the sick people and on seeing it, all the big hospitals in the city were left - the victims of chemical attack got injured
 doctoron ke haath-paanv phool gaye
 The situation became such that it became difficult to understand whom to treat and whom to leave, and many more lives were silenced in this hurry

 This means that the alliance will not ask for 'begging' for the residents and will continue to contest on its own

 Mayawati termed the BSP not getting respectable seats as the main reason for not aligning with Congress in Madhya Pradesh assembly elections
 unhone kaha ‘vaise to bijepi or congress se in virgon ke vyapak hit or sammaan kii ummid bhi nahin he, lekin inkaa apmaan bhi ham bardaasht nahin kar sakate
 Mayawati said, 'we know that neither BJP nor Congress is a friendly party for the poor of Bahujan Samaj and Savarna Samaj
 agar ve hitaishi hotin to in virgon kii saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik evam shaikshanik haalat aaj itani zyada dayaneey nahin hoti balki pichley 70 varshon main kaaphi sudhar gai hoti or satta main inaki samuchit bhagidaari bhi hoti
 Mayawati also accused the BJP and the Congress of equally weakening the BSP
 unhone kaha ‘congress va bhaajapa, donon hi partiyaan basapa or iske netritv ko kamjor, badnaam evam raajnneetik taur par kamjor karne ke liye hameshaa prayasarat rahati hai
 Especially at the time of elections, these malicious efforts become even more intense and toxic
 ’ unhone party kaaryakartaaon ko isse saavdhaan rahane ke liye aagaah bhi kiya
 Accusing the BJP of misuse of the Scheduled Caste and Tribe Atrocities Prevention Act, BSP chief Mayawati said, "the BSP does not want any law, even if it is SC / ST law, to be misused by the government machinery
" ’mayawati ne kaha ki is baat ko uttar pradesh main chaar baar basapa sarkaar ne sahi sabit bhi karke dikhaaya he, jab sarkaar majaluumon ke saath hameshaa khadi dikhaati thi
 Mayawati said that the present BJP government of the state is supporting the oppressors against Dalits and this is happening all over the state and it is necessary to get rid of it

 com / xby3fubdbg Home Minister p Chidambaram has said that all political parties in Andhra Pradesh are divided on the issue of Telangana and the Center cannot forcibly impose any solution on them
 chidambaram ne kaha ki andhrapradesh main raajnneetik dal ajeeb sthiti main fanse hue hai
 Within everybody there is a division on the issue of Telangana
 congress, telugu desham, bhakpa or makapa sabhi vibhajit hai
 The only party is the BJP which claims no division because only one of its members is an MP
 unhone kaha, chunki raajnneeti dalon ke bheetar is mudde par vibhaajan he isliye ‘janata kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaali partiyon par ham koi samaadhaan nahin thope sakate hai’ grih mantri ne kaha, jahaan tak congress party kaa sawaal he, usamen ekta laane or aisa samaadhaan khojane ke prayaas ho rahe hai jo sabhi congressi saansadon or vidhayakon ko sweekaarya hon
 He said that other political parties should also make similar efforts
 misaal ke taur par telugu desham ko bhi aisa karnaa chahie
 He should find a solution acceptable to all by bringing unity among all Telugu Desam members
 chidambaram ne kaha, ‘yah kahana bahut aasaan he ki aapane koi samaadhaan nahin khoja, lekin hamase jo bhi yah shikaayat karata he ki hamane samaadhaan nahin khoja, khud uske paas bhi koi samaadhaan nahin he
 Responding to the allegations being leveled against him by declaring the creation of a separate Telangana state, he said that as home minister he made an announcement on 9 December 2009 on behalf of the government
 uske baad andhrapradesh ke kuch kshetron main virodh pradarshan foot padane par sarkaar ne apane ruukh par punarvichaar kiya or maine 23 disambar ko uske aadhaar par doosraa bayaan diya
 He said, 'I was speaking on behalf of the government
 agar koi aisa sochataa he ki grih mantri ekatarfa taur par koi bayaan de saktaa he or phir use waapas le saktaa he to vah nadaan he

 is saal july main china kii 20 yuvatiyon kaa ek dal landan pahunchaa
 They all wore red tracksuits and their hair was also neatly cut
 jaldi hi ve vahaan tamaam logon kii utsukata kaa vishay ban gayi
 The logo of the Chinese National Women's Cricket Team was emblazoned on his tracksuit
 kaiyon ko to pataa bhi nahin tha ki aisi koi team bhi he
 There were many university students in the team, who had not taken up the bat of cricket for the first time yet
 pehla match barkshaayar county main tha
 Even though there were only English visitors coming there, there was a lot of curiosity about the match
 china kii team ko cricket khelte dekhnaa bilkul nai baat to thi hi
 The Berkshire County Ladies XI had not even fielded their strongest team against them and Chinese women were struggling to mold themselves in foreign conditions
 unhone garm or shushk mausam vaale uttar-purvi china main kritrim turf maidaanon par is daure ke liye taiyaari kii thi
 The Chinese team scored 110 runs for five wickets in 20 overs
 jab barkshaayar kii team ballebaaji ke liye krij par ai to is score kaa peechha karnaa utana aasaan sabit nahin hua jitna unhone sochaa tha
 The visiting team bowled very tightly with great discipline and fought to catch the ball on the grass field
 barkshaayar kii team kisi tarah 109 ran bana saki or apane chini mehmaanon se ek ran se haar gai
 In the next one month, the Chinese team toured the whole of England, playing against the top ranked English teams
 cricket kaa makka kahe jane vaale lodrs main bhi unhone merilbon cricket club (emsisi) kii vimens team ke khilaaf match khelaa
 He played nine matches and won eight of them
 bain-chio kii khojchin main cricket kaa koi itihaas nahin he
 Most Chinese had never even heard of ban-chiyo or bat-ball
 ve isse milte-julate ‘bangchio’ yaa besabaal ke bare main to jaanate the
 Finally, in 2005, China was formally introduced to cricket
 tab navgathit chinis cricket association (sisie) ne usee saal beijing main koching course yojit kiya
 CCA cricket manager Terry Zhang, who was associated with the campaign to promote cricket since that first course, says, "not one of the people i knew at the time knew what name cricket was
 ” phir physical ajukeshan dene vaale shikshakon ne apane skulon main is khel kii shuruyaat kii
 The very next year the first national tournament was held
 isamen se sisie ne under-15 kii pehali purush rashtriya team kaa chayan kiya
 On the basis of the overwhelming support from the ICC, Chinese administrators immediately announced that they would lead China to the Cricket World Cup by 2020
 yah daawa alabatta thodi jaldbaaji main kiya gaya tha
 The men's team has since been seen fighting hard to win
 unhen kai apmanjanak haaron kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 His worst condition was in the 2009 Asian Cricket Council (ACC) tournament
 unhone iran, thailand or maldive sareekhe deshon ke khilaaf (jinamein se ek bhi cricket kaa diggaj desh nahin he) teen match khele or teenon haare
 In the first match, the team lost to Iran by 307 runs, Thailand drove their entire team for just 37 runs and defeated them by 8 wickets
 maldive ne unhen 315 ranon se jabardast shikast di
 CCA Secretary General Song Yingchun admitted in an interview, "there were definitely plans in 2006 to knock the World Cup by 2020
 jaisaa sochaa tha vaisaa hua nahin
 “song is now in command of the cricket program and they are working on ambitious plans to fix it
 song ko sarkaar ne pehle tennis or golf ko pramot karne kaa daayitv saunpa tha or in donon hi pahalakadamiyon main unhen khaasi kamyaabi mili
 She was even involved in the search for female tennis star Li Na
 jab ve sirf aath saal kii thim tabhi se ve uske kariyar ke vikaas main madad karte aa rahe hai
 Lee later reached the world ranking of number two
 china ne kai yuva golf bhi taiyaar kiye hai jo valrd tour main apni chhap chhodie lage hai
 The government hopes that Song will achieve a similar success in the development of cricket
 song ne india today ko bataaya ki unki yojanaon main beijing main cricket ke liye samarpit pehle antarrashtriya cricket stadium kaa nirmaan sabase upar he
 He explains, “its work is going on
 main beijing main ek yaa mumkin ho to do antarrashtriya cricket maidan bananaa chahta hum
 We have talked to ACC about this
 ve hamen takneekee madad dene ko taiyaar hai
 It is necessary to organize an international tournament in China in order to increase the attractiveness of the game
 ” ve bilkul jamini str par khel ko badhaava dena or antarrashtriya kochon ko bhi laana chaahate hai
 Perhaps the biggest challenge to the development of cricket in China is the government policy in which all the attention is focused on the Olympic Games only
 1949 main piples republic of china kii sthapana ke baad se hi uske rahanumaon ne is baat ko tavajjo di ki desh zyada se zyada olympic medal jite
 This madness of medals increased even more with the 2008 Olympic Games held in Beijing
 ab yah rashtriya junun ban chukaa he ki china kisi bhi haalat main america se zyada gold medal jite
 The result was that the non-olympic Games could not get enough support and support
 jhang kehete hai, “agar cricket olympic main aa jaataa he to ham china main is khel kaa kayapalat hote dekhenge
 "he cites the example of rugby that will return from the 2016 Olympics
 cricket team jahaan turf maidaanon par practice karti he, vahiin rugby khiladinnon ko ghaas ke maidaanon par prashikshan diya jaataa he
 To be decided, many crowns cannot replace sports that the Chinese want and play to the extent of passion - table tennis, badminton, football and now baseball
 lekin chini adhikari maanate hai ki asia kaa pramukh khel hone kii vajah se cricket seekhney se china ko phayda hoga
 There are indeed many challenges for her cricket project, but the best thing has happened during the nine years of the game, the Chinese women's team has progressed very fast
 2007 main shuruyaat karne vaali uski mahila team ko abhi zyada arsa nahin hua, lekin usne bahut teji se is khel ko apana liya
 Rashid Khan, the coach and former Pakistani cricketer of both Chinese men and women teams, says that the pace of improvement in them is 'truly worth watching'
 india today se intervyuu main unhone kaha, “saat saal pehle unamem se kisi ko yah bhi nahin pataa tha ki balla kaise pakadte hai yaa ball ko kaise grip karte hai
 This interview was taken during a team training camp in Shenyang, northeast Liaoning province last month when he was about to leave for the Asian Games in South Korea
 2011 se 2014 ke bich chini mahila team teen asisi toornamenton ke final main pahunchi
 Khan says, “some six years ago, when we played for the first time with Hong Kong, we lost by a big margin
 usee team ke saath jab hamane pichley saal match khelaa to hamane unhen usase bhi bade antar se haraaya
 In the beginning of October, in the Asian Games held in South Korea, the women's team was close to making history and becoming the first Chinese cricket team to win a medal
 team semi final main to pahunch gai lekin kaansya padak ke liye hue match main srilanka se haar gai
 Manjurul Islam, a former Bangladeshi cricketer who has coached the Chinese youth team, says, “our biggest difficulty is not having facilities to teach on the grasslands
 ” unke mutabik, jo baat sabase zyada gaur karne laayak he, vah team kaa junun he
 For the love of cricket, if someone tells the story of Chinese cricket in the most powerful way, then they are its 29-year-old captain Huang Zhu
 uttar-purv ke changachun kii rahane vaali huang ne cricket khelnaa us vakt shuru kiya tha jab ve shenyang spotrs uniwarsity main padhati thim
 It was one of the few schools where cricket was first introduced
 huang kahati hai, “mujhe pataa nahin tha ki cricket kya hota he
 i used to play volleyball
 lekin jab maine pehle training seshan main bhaag liya to vah alag hi tarah kaa anubhav tha—balla ghumana, shot khilne ke liye apni kohni ko uthaanaa siikhnaa
 
 
 Seemed like a really big challenge
 mujhe usee samay cricket se pyaar ho gaya or tabhi se main lagaataar cricket khel rahi hum
 "SSU saw such talent for cricket at Huang that he left no stone unturned to retain him as a student
 unhen post graduate spotrs course ke liye daakhila diya gaya
 Huang also stood the test of this belief and accepted the team by leading them to two Asian Final matches
 england daure main unhone kai darshakon ke dil main khaas jagah banaai, khaskar jab unhone jersey ke khilaaf ek chakke or 13 chaikon ke saath 145 naabad ran banaae
 Huang and his team's players adopted coincidental cricket, but then they dedicated their lives to a sport that was heard by very few people in their country
 unki team kii saathi, 22 varshiya wicketiper liu shiyaonan bataati hai, “mere parivaar or doston main kisi ne bhi cricket ke bare main nahin suna tha
 i am happiest when playing cricket
 yah jentalman sport he
 i love teamwork and the way we help each other
 ”liu bataati hai ki cricket ke jariye unhen dost mili
 Huang and Liu also found a place to get rid of the pressures of China's university life
 huang kii tarah liu bhi agle ek saal main graduate ho jaaengi or tab unke liye yah chunanaa mushkil ho jayega ki ve apane liye ek naukari khojein yaa apana khel jari rakhen
 Cricket cannot be chosen as a career
 desh ke liye khilne par bhi cricketron ko maheene main mahaj 600 yuan (6,000 ru
 ) See you
 huang bataati hai ki unke mata-pita ko is baat ke liye raji karnaa aasaan nahin tha ki ve apana acadmic jivan us khel ko samarpit karne ja rahi thim jiske bare main unhone kabhi suna bhi nahin tha
 When China hosted the 2010 Asian Games and for the first time cricket was played as an international game on Chinese soil, he was changed
 ve kahati hai, “guangaju main hue asian khelon main meraa parivaar meraa hausala badhaane aayaa
 It was special for him to see his daughter playing for the country
 ”post grajuation ke baad apni yojanaon kii baat karte hue huang kahati hai, “mujhe kuch-na-kuch kaam shuru karnaa padegaa
 i definitely want to continue playing, but can i get some work with which i can continue playing? It is difficult to say
 ”to kya unhen ab cricket ko chunane par pachhtaawaa he? ve kahati hai, “apni jindagi or cricket, donon ko ek saath saadh paanaa mere liye mushkil rahaa he
 i have learned so much from this game, so i have no regrets
 desh ke liye khilne ke ehsaas ko main kabhi bhuluungi nahin
 The moment i came to Guangzhou to play with a bat in my hand and my family was watching me proudly — it was a glorious moment in life
 ” Actually, the boy's parents were very angry with him for lying and disobeying him
 mahendra ne apni patni puspa se yah video record karavaaya tha, yah kehete hue ki dubaara jab betaa jhooth bole to use yah video dikhaa dena
 The Employees Provident Fund (EPFO) has given good news to the Narendra Modi government, which is constantly facing the attack of opponents on the employment front

 ipiefo dwaara jari ek press relies main kaha gaya he ki is akalan main ve sabhi karmchaaree shaamil hote hai, jinke bank account aadhaar se link hote hai or ve karmchaaree bhi jo asthaayee hote hai

 The Modi government had promised to provide employment to two crore people every year, but this figure has not crossed even one crore annually
 naukariyon ke maamle main sabase badi samasya skill kii he
 Therefore, the Modi government has laid great emphasis on skill development of the youth

 a report issued by the Industry Chamber FICCI and Ernst & Young on higher education said that about 93 per cent of MBA holders and 80 per cent of graduate engineers in India are unemployed because what they are taught in educational institutions is compatible with the needs of the industry Is not

 That is, England's Stokes, who snatched the World Cup from New Zealand, are in the race for this prestigious honor
 newjiland ke captain ken williamson bhi is aword ke liye namit kiye gaye hai
 On 14 July, Stokes' superb innings (84 not out) helped the England team tie the final
 iske baad super over bhi taai rahaa
 Eventually the England team was declared the winner on the basis of putting more boundaries in the match

 com / rgimzr34te— ICC (@icc)july 16, 2019newjiland main paidaa hue stokes mahaj 12 saal kii umr main apane parivaar ke saath england chale gaye the
 His father Gerrard, who played rugby league for New Zealand, was then coaching in England
 iske baad se hi stokes england main rah rahe hai, haalanki unke parents gerard or deb christchurch laut gaye the
 New Zealander of the Year Award Chief Judge Cameron Bennett said, 'even though Stokes is not playing for the Black Caps, he is born in Christchurch, where his parents now live
 ' camran ne kaha ki jis tarah se williamson ne final or puure vishwa cap main vinaashkari niraashaa ke bich khud ko khadaa rakhaa, vah kiviyon ke saath goonjata rahaa
 The New Zealand-born Stokes has been nominated for the award along with Kiwi team captain Ken Williamson, newstalk ZB host Simon Barnett, former league star Manu Vetuvei and Abdul Aziz who emerged as heroes after the attacks on Christchurch Mosque
 isse pehle england main pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar boris johnson or jeremi hunt ne kaha tha ki stokes ko shandaar pradarshan ke liye nisehud (sar kii oopaadhi) mil sakati he
 Yes, i have asked the Aam Aadmi Party to return my blue wagon-r, a motorcycle and many other things which i and my wife Shraddha have donated to the party so far
 darasal, mujhe inamen se kuch bhi waapas nahin chahie, lekin maine wagon-aar ko apni niraashaa vyakt karne kaa hathiyaar banaaya he, kyonki arvind kejariwal sun nahin rahe hai, or dusron ko ahankaar na karne kii sikh dene vaala aaj khud sirf ahankaar kii bhashaa bol rahaa he
 i believed Arvind Kejriwal
 aaj main un par bharosa nahin karata
 Now i wonder whether what he is saying is true or not
 main 'aap' main isliye nahin aayaa tha ki dilli main ek vaikalpik sarkaar ban jaae
 i came for alternative politics, clean politics
 
 
 sirf pichley kuch dinon ke vaakyaat kii vajah se maine 'aap' se duuri banane kaa faisla nahin kiya he
 When i raised my voice against giving ticket to a tainted candidate in the recent Delhi election, no action was taken
 maine arvind kejariwal se milane kii kai baar koshish kii, taaki apni baat rakh sakuun
 i emailed maine unhen likhaa
 i tried to call them, but did not succeed by any means
 isliye maine public domen main yah mudda uthaaya
 Now people are abusing, threatening me and my wife on Twitter
 mujhe avam (aam aadmi walantier ection manch) kaa agent kaha ja rahaa he
 i am being accused of being greedy for gaining publicity
 maine 'aap' yaa kejariwal se kabhi tikat kii khwaahish nahin kii
 i am a man of software
 maine raajnneeti main kabhi kariyar nahin bananaa chaha
 I'm moved
 svachh raajnneeti kaa vah bahut bada sapana, jo hazaron ko ek saath le aayaa tha, aaj tuutakar bikhar gaya he
 i have not been able to get eyes on my father, who donated one-third of his pension to the Aam Aadmi Party
 agar 'aap' meri car, meri motorcycle or mere paise waapas kar bhi detii he, to main unhen kisi enjio ko daan kar duungaa
 i spoke to Arvind Kejriwal on 1 January 2013 and offered him a wagon-r
 maine aisa isliye kiya tha, kyonki yah ek aisi chiz thi, jisase aam aadmi khud ko jodakar dekh saktaa tha, or isse mukhyamantri ke rup main kejariwal ko aam aadmi kii chhavi milti
 They told me that they would have to issue a 'donation certificate', and get the car evaluated
 maine kaha, unamem se kuch bhi karne kii zarurat nahin he, or vah car kaa registration aam aadmi party ke naam transfar karvaa len
 This process took eight months
 ab 'aap' netritv se mere do khaas sawaal hai
 
 
 i cannot say whether Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav were right
 main iskaa faisla nahin kar saktaa
 But he asked the right questions, and was shown the way out
 main yah jaanakar bhi bahut khinn hua ki kuch vidhayakon ne shanti bhushan ko pareshaan kiya, or unhen ek meeting se baahar nikaalane kii koshish kii
 Let me say this to Arvind Kejriwal - take public action against Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, but only if you have evidence of the allegations leveled against them
 kisi ko sirf isliye baahar mat phenkiye, kyonki vah aapse sahamat nahin
 You cannot be perfect every time, all the time, no one can be
 bahuton ne mujhase poocha, agar yogendra yadav yaa prashanth bhushan koi party banaate hai, to kya main unhen samarthan duungaa
 My answer is, i will not give
 is jawaab kaa un donon se koi lenaa-dena he, balki jaisaa maine pehle bhi kaha, main yahaan dilli main vaikalpik sarkaar banane nahin aayaa tha, main aayaa tha vaikalpik raajnneeti ke liye
 
 
 
 or meraa sapana chur-chur ho gaya he
 All politicians are the same, no difference
 main raajnneeti main bharosa puri tarah kho chukaa hum
 Can a human fall so low? Can a human's life be so embarrassing? And can a person take a bite out of the mouth of a helpless person like himself only for his petty desires
 ye sawaal isliye, kyonki kashmir main ai sadi kii sabase bheeshan baadh ke baad kuch insaanon ne yahaan jo surat dikhaai di he, uske baad sachmuch aise insaanon ko insaan kehete hue shame aati he, lekin kya karen? kudarat ke baad ab kashmir aise hi insaanon ke panje main he
 In fact, as the flood waters recede in Jammu and Kashmir, starvation, pandemics and livelihoods are causing many problems
 zindagi kii gaadi ko phir se patari par laane ke liye insaan rozi-roti, sadak or makaan jaisi buniyadi zaruuraton phir se jutaney kii jaddojahad main laga he, lekin in kudarti pareshaaniyon ke bich kis kadar khud insaan hi insaan kaa dushman bana he, ye soch kar bhi ajeeb lagata he
 But what to do? This is true and the truth is that in this difficult situation how some human being is not able to kill his inner person and rob himself of his own hands by his own hands
 baadh ke pani se ghire ek shaks ne boat par aae jin logon ko farista samajha tha, vahi inke liye sabase bade dushman sabit hue
 There were some people who took them out of their homes by wearing their cloak among the relief workers, but after evacuating the house, those people themselves stole the houses and realized this when they started getting water Returned to their homes after
 jammu main 55 saal baad ai ek aisi baadh, jisane dharti ke jananath kii surat bigaad di, jate-jate ab zammu kashmir ke logon ko wo zakhm de rahi he, jiske bare main sochna bhi mushkil lagata he
 The situation is that more than 2 lakh 34 thousand people who have been evacuated by the army and other agencies from their hideouts to safe places, now they themselves are afraid to return to their homes
 ek to baadh ke pani ne unke gharon kii buniyaad hilaa di he, upar se chori or lut-khasot kii vaardaaton ne gharon main sivaay chand eenton kii charadivari ke or kuch bhi nahin choda he
 The question is, after all, who are those people in the hour of trouble, who are not desirous of robbing a helpless person from the first condition? Are they really humans or is there something else in the shape of humans? world kapmen bharat kaa yah pehla match tha
 The team was denied victory in the long tour of Australia
 aise main pehla hi machapakistanse hona bade dabaav kii baat thi, lekin dhoni ne yah jataa diya ki unhen captain kool kyon kaha jaataa he
 In the Adelaide field, India defeated Pakistan by 76 runs to win the World Cup for the sixth time
 dhoni ne hameshaa kii tarah kisi tarah kaa imoshan dikhaae bagaiyr match apni jholii main daal liya or team kii ummiden badha deen
 Virat Kohli, Raina and Shikhar Dhawan battling with form played a tremendous innings
 300 kaa score vanade cricket main hameshaa vipakshi par manovaigyanik dabaav daalata he or is baar bhi aisa hua
 Pakistan's team could not chase this huge score
 hamaare gendbaajon khaskar shami ne behtareen genden kii
 Spinner Ashwin got only one wicket, but threw three maiden overs and buried his flag
 unki is kifayati gendbaaji se pakistan bada score khadaa karne main naakaamayaab rahaa
 The fielding, batting and bowling of the team were of the highest order
 har khilaadi ne apni jimmedaari achche se nibhaai
 But one question that no one is able to answer is, why does Pakistan lose to India in the World Cup? Pakistani experts and former players sitting in TV channels on Sunday also could not answer this question
 unhone match kaa vishleshan to kiya lekin yah nahin bataa paae ki world cap main aakhir aisa kya hota he ki pakistan kii team haar jaati he
 The Pakistan team, which won the World Cup title in 1992, lost to India in Sydney
 216 ke chote se score ko paar karnaa unke liye baari ho gaya tha
 Since then the series has started and continues till now
 har baar paatr badal jate hai lekin parinaam vahi rahata he
 The strong looking Pakistani team loses
 iskaa har baar alag kaaran bataaya jaataa he lekin baar-baar yah kyon hota he, iskaa kaaran koi nahin bataa paata he
 It is also worth noting that in ODI cricket Pakistan has defeated India more times
 har baar pakistani captain kaa jawaab hota he ki pataa nahin kya hua or ham haar gaye
 They can tell the immediate reason but they are not able to say it for sure
 vaaki is baat kaa rahasy koun bataa paaegaa? aise main tej gendbaaj shoeb akhtar kii baat sahi lagati he allaah hi bataa paaegaa ki pakistan har baar kyon haar jaataa he

 com / sevr4oluid Nursery admission is not easy in Delhi, the capital of the country, the admission process has been made difficult by the changing admission rules every year
 sarkaar abhibhavakon kii dikkat ke liye skulon ko jimmedaar tehraati he, jabaki skulon kaa tark he ki baar-baar badalte niyamon kii vajah se skool or abhibhavak donon pareshaan hote hai
 Set up private schools in nursery admission
 Criteria: High Court should go outside any school in the capital
 
 
 lagbhag tasviir ek si hogi
 Somewhere the point system is overcrowded, sometimes there is a confusion of documents, somewhere there is confusion on the upper edge, somewhere the ABCD of online-offline and among them are the little ones who want to take their first steps in school
 
 
 lekin jab desh kii rajdhani main hi nursery daakhile kii prakriya itani jatil ho to abhibhavak ke paas skulon ke chakkar lagane ke alaava koi doosraa vikalp nahin dikhataa
 Nursery Admission: Now the form will be filled till 31 January Now the question arises that who is responsible for this problem of parents? Should schools be held responsible for the complicated process of nursery admission or the government which implements new rules for repeated admissions and the matter reaches the court
 is saal bhi maamla court main he
 But this is not the first time that due to the changing rules, the screw of admission is stuck
 chaliye aap ko bataate hai ki kab-kab or kaise nursery daakhile ke niyam kabhi sarkaar kii nitiyon to kabhi court ke adeshon ke baad badalte rahe
 
 
 Is admission in Oxford University even more difficult than admission to the nursery schools of Delhi? - Until the year 2004, the schools had the right to interview the child and his parents for admission
 sarkari jameen par bane skulon kii 20 fisadi siten EWS cote ke bacchon ke liye arakshit thi
 - In 2004, a guardian named Rakesh Agarwal challenged the admission process in the court
 - saal 2007 main hai court ne daakhile main screening or saakshaatkaar ko khatm karte hue ashok ganguli kamity banaai
 The Ganguly Committee created a 100 point formula based on criteria such as Neighborhood, Sibling, Parents Education
 - saal 2007 main ection kamity for anaded ricognised privet skool ne supreme court main ganguli kamity kii siforeeshon ko chunauti di
 In 2008, with a slight change, the recommendations of the Ganguly Committee were implemented in nursery admissions, which allowed schools to prescribe criterias
 - saal 2008 se 2010 tak ganguli kamity kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par skulon main daakhila hota tha
 In 2010, the 'right to Education Act' came into force and the EWS quota increased from 20 percent to 25 percent
 - saal 2010 main ganguli kamity kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par nursery daakhile ke liye skulon ne phir se guideline jari kiye lekin soshal jurist sanstha ne skulon ke point or criteria system ko adaalat main chunauti dete hue 'rhite tu ajukeshan act' lagu karne kii maang kii
 The matter was pending in the court and the schools once again filed admissions from 2010 to 2013 based on the recommendations of the Ganguly Committee, which included management quota, staff quota
 - farvari 2013 main dilli hai court ne nursery daakhile ko 'rhite tu ajukeshan act' se baahar rakhte hue kaha ki nursery daakhila 6 saal se kam umr ke bacchon ke liye he
 During President's rule in December 2013, LG issued a guideline with 70 point Neighborhood Formula and abolished the management quota from nursery admission
 - alji ke notification ko privet skulon ne ek baar phir court main chunauti di or daakhile kii prakriya march 2014 tak khinch gayi
 In November 2014, the Delhi High Court rejected the guidelines issued by LG and once again approved the admission based on the recommendations of the Ashok Ganguly Committee
 haalanki sarkaar ne hai court ke faisle ke khilaaf supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya, lekin tab tak skulon main nursery daakhile skulon dwaara jari kiye gaye criteria ke aadhaar par ho chuke the
 - In November 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party government passed the Delhi School Education Bill but did not get the approval of the Center
 2015 main sarkaar ne management kota khatm karte hue guideline jari kiye, jiske khilaaf skulon ne hoicourt kaa rukh kiya
 The decision came in favor of schools
 - saath hi EWS cote ke liye navambar 2015 main sarkaar ne centralined online aavedan kii prakriya shuru kii
 In December 2016, the Delhi government issued separate guidelines for 1400 schools built on private land and management quota for 298 schools built on government land in January 2017 for mandatory admission to Neighborhoods within a range of 0-1 km
 Abolished criterias like staff quota, alumni
 jiske baad maamla ek baar phir court main he
 It is worth noting that during the hearing, the Delhi High Court has reprimanded the Delhi government as to why the government releases the admission guidelines in november-december only, this increases the confusion of parents
 nursery admician: dilli main 298 privet skulon main khatm hua management kotagoratlab he ki rajdhani main pehali baar privet skulon ke liye do alag tarah kii guideline jari kii gai
 According to the government, the new guidelines will bring transparency in admission
 lekin skulon kii maane to sarkaar abhibhavakon kii ulajhane sulajhane ke bajaay badha rahi he
 According to experts, the government, school association, parent association should all sit together and make a common admission process to avoid this riot of admission, which does not change with change of year or government
 is saal to mishan admician kanoonee daanv-pench main ulajh gaya he, lekin ummid he ki nae satr main nursery daakhile kii guideline abhibhavakon kii raah aasaan karegi

 India have already confirmed their place in the quarter-finals by putting on a hat-trick of victory

 The world's fourth-seeded Netherlands are known for playing more aggressive hockey than sixth-ranked India
 usne pakistan ko 4-0 se, scotland ko 3-0 se maat di thi
 He will face Canada on Monday
 agar vah kanada ke khilaaf jeet hasil kar leti he to quarter final main pahunch jaaegi nahin to bharat ke khilaaf use har haal main jeet hasil karne hogi
 On the other hand, if India wins this match, then they will go as the top team in Pool b in the quarter-finals
 tippaniyan The two teams had earlier clashed at the Rio Olympics last year where the Netherlands had beaten 2–1
 isse pehle 2015 main bharat ne netherlands ko shootout main 3-2 se maat di thi
 Indian team coach Roelant Oltmans has said, "we don't want to think about past records
 donon timen 2015 or 2016 se kaaphi badali hui hai
 There have been some changes in the team
 ham is samay kal ke match par dhyaan de rahe hai

 Adhir Ranjan Choudhary in the House said that the Congress was called a terrorist party (by BJP MP Pragya Thakur), the party from which thousands of leaders sacrificed for the independence of the country
 ab kya ho rahaa he? kya sadan is par chup rahegaa? mahatma gandhi ke hatyare ko 'deshbhakt' kaha gaya
 Meanwhile, AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi has moved a motion for breach of privilege against Pragya Thakur

 Also, in the BJP Parliamentary Party meetings to be held during the session, Sadhvi Pragya has been told not to come

 is saal ke madhya main hue loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bhi unhone nathuram godse ko deshbhakt bataaya tha
 Then PM Modi also expressed displeasure over Pragya Singh Thakur's statement

 The Border Security Force on Monday morning recovered a suspected Pakistani boat from a place called Dharm Kot Pattan, 40 km from Gurdaspur
 jisaki soochna ek sthaneey mallaah ne adhikariyon ko di
 Now the boat is being investigated
 yah sandigdh naav gurdaspur ke deraa baba nanak sector se mili he
 Which has reached India after flowing through the river Ravi
 is naav ko sabase pehle ek sthaneey mallaah tarsem messiah ne dekha
 Tarsem arrived at 7 am to get people across the river Ravi
 jaise hi unhonesandigdh navadekhi to use paar lagaakar turant BSF adhikariyon ko suchit kiya
 Shortly after receiving the information, BSF officers reached Dharamkot port and took the boat into their possession
 naav pathankot aatankwaadi hamale kii barsi se thik pehle mili he
 Therefore BSF officers are closely investigating this
 yah naav aasamaani nile rang kii he
 It is written that this boat belongs to Manz Agro Farms, Kasar, Narowal
 jiskaa prabandhak mohammad sajid he
 Its proper identification number is 03431 237 545 on the boat
 iske alaava 042 36 666 195 bhi likhaa hua he
 Apart from the national emblem of Pakistan on the boat, something has been written in Urdu
 BSF ke sutron ke mutabik raavi nadi main pichley dinon barish se baadh ai hui he
 Because of which this boat appears to have reached Gurdaspur from Narowal in Pakistan
 nadi main baadh aane ke kaaran sthaneey marana pattan pul bhi bah gaya he
 In fact, the Ravi river flows through parts of Pakistan and reaches Punjab
 isliye andeshaa he ki yah naav sambhawatah nadi apane saath bahaakar le ai ho
 This is not the first time a Pakistani boat has arrived in India
 pichley saal bhi is tarah kii do kishtiyaan punjab main baraamad kii gai thi
 But the only difference in the boat recovered last year is that the owner's address and contact have been written on this boat
