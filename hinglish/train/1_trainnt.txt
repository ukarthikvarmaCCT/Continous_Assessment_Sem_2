 jaj kii aapatti ko kiya gaya tha nazarandaajadrasal, 2010 main justise kabir kii bahan kabir sinha shukla ko kalakatta hai court kaajajaniyukt kiya gaya tha
 In this case, the objection of Justice Bhattacharya was ignored by the High Court Collegium
 sarkaar kii taraf se atorni general mukul rohati ne kaha hai court ke collegium ke paanch jajon main se ek ne iskaa virodh kiya tha or baqayada patr bhi likhaa tha
 But since she opposed the appointment of a female lawyer as a judge on the basis of her age and academic ability, her access to the Supreme Court was closed
 sarkaar ne bolaa collegium system par hamalarohatagi ne kaha ki collegium kaa tarika asafal rahaa he kyonki yah apaardarshee tantra he jisane loktantr kaa galaa ghonta he
 After the Attorney General's attack on the collegium system and the larger bench of the 1993 judgment sought to be reconsidered, the apex court indicated that it could decide on the matter even before their arguments are over
 rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog adhinium ko chunauti dene vaali yachika par paanch nyaayadhishon vaali peeth ke samaksh daleel jari rakhte hue unhone kaha, nai vyavastha ko waapas laae jane se aaj loktantr waapas aa gaya he
 System is not transparent, Rohtagi says that there was a lack of transparency in the previous system, which is evident from the fact that even under the RTI Act, complete information is not coming out on the functioning of the collegium system

 The Attorney General said before a bench headed by Justice JS Khehar, "why no one is in favor of knowing the decisions of the collegium in the era of RTI?" He demanded that the case be referred to a larger bench than the bench of nine judges who delivered the verdict in 1993
 unhone kaha ki nyaayadhishon kii niyukti ke liye ek khaas vyavastha ko nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa kaa aadhaar nahin kaha ja saktaa, jo samvidhan ke tahat kai check and balance ke adheen he or naye kanoon ne prakriya main loktantr ko behaal kiya he

 ’gauratlab he ki khan ko haal hi main sthaneey taliban or sarkaar ke bich ek sangharsh viraam karaane ke liye madhyasthata karne kii peshkash kii gai thi
 Imran claimed that if his 'tehreek-e-insaf' party wins the election and comes to power, he will make Pakistan a 'true Islamic welfare state'
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki unki party kattarpanthi sanghathan ’jamaat e islamic’ ke kareeb he or donon hi partiyon ne 2008 ke aam chunaav kaa bahishkaar kiya tha

 The former cricketer said, 'the President's post is still in the hands of a dictator, who is facing a friendly opposition from PML-N, but the political system is similar to that of General Pervez Musharraf's era
 ’ Popularly known as Suresh Kalmadi for his strong hold in politics, defense and sports, the Commonwealth Games were a major point for Sports as Sports Administrator, but the same sports put a strain on Kalmadi's life which would probably take him years to erase

 Kalmadi has been the President of the Indian Olympic Association for the last 15 years and during this time he organized Afro Asian Games and Commonwealth Games in the country but it seems that the style of the sports administrator of 67 years became his biggest enemy because his various sports federations occupied him
 The comrades accused him of being a 'dictator'
 kalmari ko aaj rashtramandal khelon kii aayojan samiti se bakhrast kiya janaa khel prashaasak ke taur unke karier ke ant kaa sanket mana ja rahaa he

 The central government sought time to clear its stand regarding the final mechanism
 supreme court ne do hafte kii mohalat dete hue sunwaayee 6 march tak taal di
 Misbehaved with Delhi Chief Secretary in front of Kejriwal? Anshu Prakash, who met Rajnath before this, had issued a notice to the General Secretary of the Central Government, Election Commission, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the matter of giving life pension and allowance to former mps
 supreme court ne purv saansadon ko aaajeevan pension or alouns die jane ke khilaaf daayar yachika par jawaab maanga tha
 However, during the hearing, the Supreme Court also said that we have seen the era when many politicians have died in Gurbat (poverty) even after serving as mps for a long time
 lokprahari naamak NGO ne supreme court main janhit yachika daakhil kar kaha he ki purv saasandon or vidhayakon ko aaajeevan pension di ja rahi he, jabaki ye niyamon main shaamil nahin he
 Police complaint of 'AAP' MLA- Chief Secretary abused by name of caste

 saath hi vah jeevanabhar ek saathi ke saath train main free yatra karne kaa hakdaar ho jaataa he jabaki rajya ke rajyapal ko bhi aaajeevan pension nahin di jaati
 Even the present judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court are not given the benefit of free travel with a partner or assistant
 yahaan tak kii jaj agar apni aadhikarik yatra par hi kyon naa hon
 In such a situation, this system is a burden for the common people
 ye vyavastha raajnneeti ko or bhi lubhaavna bana detii he
 Actually, this expenditure is incurred on such people who are not representing the public
 isliye is vyavastha ko khatm kiya janaa chahie
 It will be interesting to see now whether the central government postpones its answer on this issue or what is the stand of the court on 6 March

 com The theme of the India Today Mindrocks session, Not So Idiot Box, was how television can be made intelligent for an intelligent youth
 (intelegent televijan for intelegent youth) is satr main actor vivek obaroy, tanuj veeravani or actress nidhi singh ne shirkat kii
 The session was moderated by India Today Deputy Editor Sushant Mehta
 ‘digital’madhyamentrtenment kii duniya menteji se film or theatre kii jagah le rahaa he
 The big-time Bollywood actor is not only leaving the big screen and reaching the small screen, but he is trying to get hold of digital as well as social media
 vivek obaroy ne kaha ki desh kii 125 karod janata main sirf 2
 50 million people go to the theater and watch the film
 vahiin mobile or soshal media ke sahare 50 se 60 karod logon tak pahunch ban rahi he
 Actor Tanuj Virwani said that the digital medium is different from television and theater because there is no one between the artist and the audience in the digital medium
 yahaan darshak kisi web siries ko dekhne ke liye itnaa besabr rahata he ki vah ek baar main 8-10 apisod kii siries dekh letaa he
 Tanuj believes that working in a web series is better for an artist than film and television
 kalakaar ko web siries main kaam karne ke liye apane kirdaar main lambey samay tak rahane kaa mauka miltaa he
 He is able to give enough time to his character, which also shows a good improvement in his acting over time
 digital medium main sensor board kii jagah nahinvivek obaroy ne kaha ki digital kaa sabase bada phayda he ki yahaan ban rahe programs ko sensor board kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 Vivek actually has no role in the censor boarding of the present day
 vivek ne kaha ki digital kii duniya mencensor board dianasorahai
 Just need to finish them in films too

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is being targeted for a recent incident on social media
 darasal isaki vajah ek photo bani he, jo viral ho rahi he
 In this, TS Singhdev, a cabinet minister of the new Congress government formed in Chhattisgarh, is shown touching Rahul's feet
 aapako bataa den ki mantri singhdev kii umr rahul gandhi se kaaphi zyaada he
 This photo was posted on the Facebook page named 'india against Presstitudes'
 saath hi capshan diya gaya- '48 saal ke senior 80 saal ke apane junior ko aashirwad dete hue
 My friend Pappu ji is very kind
 'hajaaron logon ne is post ko share kiya or in par saikadon logon ne coment kiye
 In these comments, Rahul Gandhi and Congress culture were attacked
 kai logon ne photo ko photoshop bataate hue isaki vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthaaya
 India Today Fact Check found that the photo is genuine
 chhattisgarh ke mantri ties singhdev vaaki rahul ke saamne jhuke the
 This picture has also been posted on the social pageant and i support Facebook pages named Modi Ji and BJP
 congress adhyaksh par tamaam kataaksh kiye gaye
 In this picture it can be seen that a man with white hair is bowing in front of Rahul
 rahul ke peeche purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh bhi khadey dikhaai de rahe hai or unke haathon main phulon kaa guladasta he
 Senior Congress leader RPN Singh is also seen standing on the red carpet
 india today ne ties singhdev se soshal media par tasviir ko lekar kiye ja rahe daavon par baat kii
 On this, Singhdev made it clear that this picture was taken on 17 December at the swearing-in ceremony
 jab rahul vahaan aae to wo vahaan maujuud the
 However, according to Singhdev, he did not try to touch Rahul's feet, just shook hands with him
 singhdev ke mutabik tasviir photoshop he
 Simultaneously, Singhdev admitted that on special occasions, his senior party leaders have a habit of touching their feet, irrespective of their age
 singhdev ne kaha, ‘us din bhi maine shapath grahan ke baad manch par baithe mehmaanon ke pair chhue the
 Singh Dev said, "just after taking my oath as a minister, i also tried to touch Rahul Gandhi's feet on the stage, but he stopped me from doing so
" ’ singh dev ne asal main manch par baithe mehmaanon ke pair chhue the or unhen rahul gandhi ne roka tha
 This incident can be seen in the video below
 hamen aisa koi or video nahin mila jo viral tasviir main kaid ghatnakram ko sabit kar saktaa
 We also did not find any evidence that could corroborate Singhdev's claim that the photograph is photoshopped
 jab hamane singhdev se jaananaa chaha ki us vakt asal main hua kya tha, to unhone virodhabhasi bayaan diya
 He also spoke of lifting a handkerchief from the ground, but no such handkerchief appears in the picture
 tasviir ko baariki se dekhne par pataa chalata he ki tasviir main jo kirdaar dikh rahe hai, unki chaaya unase sahi ellinement main milti he
 It also indicates that the picture is real
 ek sthaneey akhbaar rajasthan patrikane bhi viral tasviir prakashit kii or daawa kiya ki mantri vastav main dow manmohan singh kii ore se pakade guladaste se farsh par latak rahe dhaage ko pakadaney kii koshish kar rahe the
 But in the picture it can be seen that the thread was nowhere near the ground
 ye bhi dekha ja saktaa he ki singhdev rahul ke saamne hi jhuk rahe the, naa ki manmohan singh ke jo ki kuch hi kadam dur the
 We also spoke to Congress leader RPN Singh who was present there
 unhone pushti kii ki singhdev ne entress par rahul ke pair chune kii koshish kii thi lekin rahul ne unhen aisa karne se pehle hi roak diya tha
 Controversy and violence have been taking place in the Prime Minister's Khadi calendar over photos
 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne modi or gandhiji kii photo ek saath tavit karte hue gandhi kii vichaardhaara kii tulana piem kii vichaardhaara se kii he
 Taking a jibe at the Prime Minister, Randeep tweeted that Gandhi's ideology was to think of the poorest and the weakest section whenever he suspected himself
 usko soch kar hi aage kii ranneeti banaao, magar modi kii vichaardhaara khud par kendrit he
 'PM worries about publicity more than poor' Surjewala said that pm's concern is more on its PR campaign
 koun sa kurta pahananaa he ? kaisaa laganaa he? kya twit karnaa he ? or kya whatsapp karnaa he ? yahi piem modi kii vichaardhaara he
 Senior Congress leader Sanjay Singh also took this issue further and said that Gandhi and Modi cannot be compared
 Gandhiji's talisman v / s Modiji's talisman

 Not only this, he said that Gandhiji gave his whole life to the service of the country
 desh hi nahin balki videsh main bhi unki khyaati he
 He says that through this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hurt the dignity and feelings of the country

 The Prime Minister's Office, while defying the whole issue, said that they do not see any controversy in it and there is no fixed rule or law to print Gandhi's picture

 C
 B
 n (@d6f88ac54f8e40e)august 4, 2017 The financial year 2014-15 continues and the interim budget has also arrived
 pehle saal main kar-vyay main bade badlaav hone kii gunjaaish bhi kaaphi simit he
 Therefore, the main focus of the new government should be on the slightest manipulation of the budget, so that the direction of future financial steps can be fixed and, as far as possible, moved towards that new direction
 kar ke morche par sanshodhit bajet ko mukhya rup se 31 march, 2016 tak saamaan or seva kar (jiesti) main sudhaar par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie
 Also, in order to gain the confidence of the states, attention should be paid to paying their dues under the central sales tax
 sanshodhit bajet main agle vitt varsh se pratyaksh kar samhita (ditisi) lagu karne kii patibaddhta bhi dikhaai deni chahie
 As far as the current year is concerned, in this year, there should be an attempt to make an agreement on it by altering its schedule
 bajet main niveshkon ko yah bharosa bhi diya janaa chahie ki sarkaar pichhali tarikhon se kar vasuul karne kaa kadam nahin uthaaegi
 By doing this, those investments which were initially profitable, would no longer be profitable
 sarkaar ko isi ke saath-saath logon ko yah saaf chetavanee bhi deni chahie ki kar chori ko bilkul bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 At the same time, the government should also make it clear that investigation of tax evasion will be done very rigorously and at a fast pace
 ek udyog arthshaastri hone ke naate fori aarthik sudhaaron ke maamle main main sarkaar ko vyapaar-udyog sudhaaron kii disha main lautne kii salaah duungaa
 These reform works have been pending since 2007-08
 ham ucch audyogic kar dar ko 10 pratishat se 7 pratishat tak ghataane se shuruyaat kar sakate hai
 On the expenditure front, the capital expenditure in the interim budget is 1 of the gross domestic product (GDP)
 76 pratishat se badhaakar 2 pratishat jarur karnaa chahie
 In the budget, the government should also show commitment to take a decision within the stipulated time, on the appeal of the President's approval for amendment of the central laws related to the subjects of the concurrent list of the Constitution
 isse pehle saal main hi bhoomi, shram or saamaajik kanoonon main sudhaar kii prakriya shuru ho jaaegi
 Overcome the fiscal deficit: In five years, the government should achieve adequate fiscal consolidation
 sarkaar ko yah jarur sunishchit karnaa chahie ki kisi bhi sthiti main kendriya bajet main rajkoshiya ghaataa har saal 4
 Be less than 5 percent
 iskaa nateeja yah hoga ki vruddhi tej hone par karj or jidipi kaa anupaat ghat jayega
 On the tax front, after the establishment of GST and DTC, the main issue will be to increase the tax and GDP ratio, which remains very low in India
 iske liye kar kaa dayera badhaane or soochna-praudyogiki ke rachanaatmak istemaal se kar prashasan ko sudhaarney jaise upayon kii darkaar he
 For example, by not levying tax on agricultural income, the scope of taxation shrinks and tax evasion also increases
 kam-se-kam shahari krishi aay ko kar ke daayre main laane kii koshish kii jaani chahie
 Similarly, the base of the dietary tax should also be increased
 kar vibhaagon ko soochna ke aadan-pradaan kaa zyada laabh lene kii jarurat he
 There is a need for greater exchange of information between the Central and State Tax Departments and the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Central Excise and Customs Department
 kharch ke morche par sarkaar ko paanchaven saal tak jidipi mank apni hissedari maamuli se 4 pratishat tak badhaakar puunjigat kharch kii ore badhaane kii jarurat hogi, jo str 2003-04 main tha
 This will be necessary to raise sufficient revenue to overcome the shortage on the infrastructure front including electricity
 is tarah bijli bhi ek bahut badi aabaadi ko muhaiyaa ho paaegi
 The government also spends on health expenditure 1 of the current GDP
 3 pratishat se badhaakar paanchaven saal tak jidipi ke 2
 5 percent will have to be taken
 yah pipeline se peyajal muhaiyaa karaane, shauchalayon kii vyavastha karne or saarvajanik swasthya sevaaon main sudhaar kar zyada badi aabaadi tak pahunch banane jaise kadamon ke liye bahut jaruri hoga
 Along with this increase in spending, if the goal of fiscal consolidation is kept, then the measure of increasing the tax-gdp ratio will not be sufficient
 sarkaar ko sabsidi main katautee kerani hogi
 Economic efficiency is affected due to various subsidies related to petrol, diesel, kerosene, cooking gas, fertilizers, electricity and water in the country, while these concessions mainly benefit the non-poor
 na karen paisa barbadapetrol or dijal kii sabsidi khatm karne ke charan shuru ho chuke hai or unhen taarkik parinti tak pahunchane dena chahie
 Of course, subsidy on fertilizer should also be abolished gradually as the use of fertilizer is increasing considerably
 khaad kaa istemaal badaae se mitti tathaa paryaavaran nasht ho rahaa he
 The process was initiated by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, but the UPA government reversed it
 bijli or pani donon par sabsidi se nuksaan hua he
 Water wastage has increased especially in irrigation
 in riyaayaton ko khatm karke tapak sinchai or pani kii bachat karne vaali duusari vidhiyon ko badhaava diya janaa chahie
 However, even after adopting these measures, it will not be possible to achieve the goal of fiscal consolidation as the increased expenditure on social sector and infrastructure will have to be compensated
 isliye sarkaar ko bade paimaane par vinievesh ke upayon kii ore lautnaa hoga
 This will also increase the capacity of the economy

 Ashok Singh had only one answer to all such questions that he could not understand what to do

 The government lawyer also said if he got money for lying, Ashok Singh replied in the negative

 Sometimes such words are used that are surprising

 It seems that those who run the country have forgotten the language of profanity
 vipakshi dal kuntha or niraashaa main to aisi baaten karte hai lekin sattarudh netaaon ke munh se aisa sunanaa hairaani bharaa hota he
 They are expected to be the least responsible words
 adaalat ke hastkshep ke baad yaa vidhi ayog ke koi maargdarshika jari karne ke baad ab ho saktaa he ki halaat kuch badalen
 Some leaders or political activists may change and try to learn the best, but it is difficult to say that all will change
 tahazeeb ek din main nahin aati or na hi sanskaar
 All these come from years of effort and how much change can happen to those who are filled with frustrations or hatred? Will they change once a new rule is created? Will political parties teach their leaders and activists the decency of language? The questions are difficult
 lekin ab chunki pani sir se upar jane laga tha to ek pratikriya honi hi thi
 Now this is a good move and it will have some effect in the coming time

 There has been uproar over LK Advani's suggestion to reintroduce his commitment to secularism to BJP to add new allies
 aresas ke varisht netaa emji vaidya kaa kahana he ki unhen samaj main nahin aata ki adwani aisa kyon kah rahe hai
 Whereas the Congress feels that Advani has made this statement only to prevent Narendra Modi from moving ahead so that allies like Nitish are prepared in his name instead of Modi
 adwani kaa kahana he ki endie kaa kunba badhaane ke liye zaruri he ki bijepi dharmanirpekshata ko lekar apni patibaddhta ko phir se logon ke saamne rakhe
 Earlier, Nitish had said that the nda's prime ministerial candidate should be of secular image
 bahes isliye bhi badi ho jaati he kyonki ram mandir andolan ke ufaan ke vakt adwani ne chhadam dharmanirpekshata kaa naaraa uchhaala tha
 However, during his visit to Pakistan, Advani tried to change the image by calling Jinnah a secular, which brought the Sangh Parivar to a boil, and now once again people belonging to RSS have become sharper
 tippaniyan By the way, the big leaders of BJP believe that Advani did not say anything that hindered Modi's path because Narendra Modi has also been trying to change his staunch image for the last one year as Advani had tried
 isaki shuruyaat modi ne sadbhaavna mishan se kii or pichhali baar kii tarah is baar unke chunavi bhaashan musalamaanon ke khilaaf nahin hai
 But the question is whether leaders like Mamata Banerjee, Naveen Patnaik and Chandrababu Naidu, who do politics in the name of minorities, can support Modi
 shaayad isiilie sawaal uthaa he ki kya adwani ne pradhanmantri banane kii ichha puri karne ke liye yah daanv chalaa he
 Advani says that in order to increase the nda's clan, it is necessary that BJP should put its commitment to secularism again in front of people
 isse pehle, nitish ne kaha tha ki endie kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar secular chhavi kaa hona chahie
 The debate also becomes bigger because during the boom of Ram temple movement, Advani had raised the slogan of pseudo secularism
 haalanki pakistan yatra main adwani ne jinna ko secular bataakar chhavi badalane kii koshish kii jisase sangh parivaar main ubaal aa gaya tha or ab ek baar phir aresas se jude logon ke tevar tikhe ho gaye hai
 The comments vaise, bijepi ke bade netaa maanate hai ki adwani ne aisa kuch nahin kaha jisase modi ke raste main rukaawat aae kyonki narendra modi bhi pichley ek saal se apni kattar chhavi ko badalane kii waisi hi kavayad main jute hai jaisi koshish adwani ne kii thi
 It was started by Modi with Sadbhavna Mission and this time like last time his election speeches are not against Muslims
 lekin sawaal yah he ki kya alpsankhyakon ke naam par raajnneeti karne vaale mamata banerjee, naveen patnayak or chandrababu naidu jaise netaa modi kaa saath de sakate hai
 Perhaps that is why the question has arisen whether Advani has taken this bet to fulfill his desire to become Prime Minister

 partner ke liye time nikalenrishton ko lambii umr dene ke liye unke saath acha samay bitaana bhi bahut jaruri hota he
 If you do not give time to your partner, it will cause a communication gap and there will be emptiness between you
 aage jaakar yahi khalipanarishta tuutane kii vajah ban saktaa he
 So talking about your partner's likes and dislikes, Hobby and his career goals can help you continue your conversation

 4
 negative baton se bachenkisi ke bhi saamne apni personal baaten na karen or na hi apane partner kaa majaak udaayen
 Stop judging your partner all the time
 aisa karne se har vakt aapke bich tanaav bana rahegaa or dhire-dhire aap donon ke bich nafrat janm le sakati he
 Try to solve each other's issues together and avoid taking advice from any third
 5
 Use sparingly, there are fights in every relationship

 Whenever there is debate, be restrained
 kehete hai ki jab bhi ladaai ho to ek insaan kaa chup ho janaa hi acha hota he

 isi ko lekar yogi adityanath aaj kaha ki mahapurushon ke janm ke din chuttee band honi chahie
 However, he said this on Bhimrao Ambedkar Jayanti, so his opponents can raise questions as to why you chose this day for this question
 ullekhneey he ki bhimrao ambedkar kii 126veen jayanti par manch se swatchta kaa naaraa dete hue yogi adityanath ne kaha ki saal 2022 tak desh ko svachh kar denge

 After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement on Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti's case, the government has now tightened its stand
 vipaksh ne modi ke bayaan ke baavjood rajyasabha main kaamkaaj nahin hone diya, or vah sadhvi ke istife kii maang par ada hua he
 Similarly, proceedings in the Lok Sabha were also boycotted demanding the Prime Minister's statement
 sansad main bane gatirodh ko dur karne ke liye vipaksh kii ore se ek ninda prastaav laane kaa suzav bhi diya gaya he
 CPM leader Sitaram Yechury suggested this, according to which it can be said that the House condemns such statements, but the government is not ready to bow to the opposition any more
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki agar aisa koi prastaav aata he to phir usamen varsh 1952 se ab tak die gaye aise tamaam vivaadaaspad bayanon kaa zikr hona chahie, jisamen modi ke bare main sonia gandhi ke die gaye 'maut ke saudagar' vaala bayaan bhi shaamil kiya jaae
 The government says that the statement of Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti was wrong, that's why Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself warned on his own behalf at the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting on Tuesday
 iske baad niranjan jyoti ne donon sadanon main apane bayaan ke liye maafee maangi or apshabd waapas le liye
 Despite this, the opposition remained adamant for the Prime Minister's statement and Sadhvi's resignation
 gatirodh dur karne ke liye sarkaar kii ore se pahal kii gai, or pramukh vipakshi dal congress se sarkaar ke aalaa mantriyon kii baatcheet ke baad tay hua ki pradhanmantri guuruuvaar ko rajyasabha main bayaan denge, jiske baad sadan kii kaarywahi chalegi
 According to the agreed agreement, the Prime Minister gave the statement, in which he not only denied the statement of Niranjan Jyoti, but also said that he had given the advice not to give such statement
 magar ain vakt par congress apane vaade se palat gai or baaki vipakshi dalon ke saath uske saansadon ne hangaamaa kar kaarywahi nahin chalane di
 According to Congress leaders, there are two reasons for this reversal
 pehali, baaki vipakshi dal istife kii maang par jor de rahe hai, lihaaza congress vipakshi ekta nahin todna chaahati
 Secondly, the leadership of the Congress is against giving concession to the BJP on any such issue, because according to it, the BJP too had stalled Parliament for several weeks while in opposition
 lekin sarkaar ab sadhvi ke mudde ko doosraa mode dene kii taiyaari main he
 BJP leaders say that the Nishad class from which Sadhvi comes from has spread from eastern Uttar Pradesh in the Gangetic region to Bihar and in this election this class strongly supported the BJP in the name of Modi
 niranjan jyoti bundelkhand ilaake se hai
 He belongs to a poor and backward family
 is ilaake main bahujan samaaj party kaa dabadabaa rahaa he, magar maafee maangane ke baavjood jis tarah se sadhvi ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he, usase nishad, mallaah aadi varg main rosh kii khabaren dilli pahunch rahi hai
 That is, if the opposition wants to make it a big political issue then the government will not be left behind
 sarkaar ke prabandhakon kaa aarope he ki jis teji ke saath ek ke baad ek bill sansad main paas ho rahe hai, usase vipaksh ghabaraaya hua he or isiilie sadhvi ke mudde ko tool diya ja rahaa he
 The government has made it clear that if the opposition wants it, the Parliament can remain stagnant for the next two weeks, but at the last moment the government will die only by passing insurance and pension bills
 sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha he ki loksabhaa main jiesti bill bhi pesh kar diya jayega
 Accepting the principle of anything being possible in politics, former Samajwadi Party General Secretary Mohammad Azam Khan has said that at present he has no idea of going to Congress
 ajam ne ravivaar ko ek samaaroh main apane raajnneetik bhavishya ko lekar samvaadadaataaon ke sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue kaha 'sab kehete hai ki raajnneeti main sab kuch sambhav he lekin philhal meraa congress main jane kaa koi sawaal nahin he
 He said that after brainstorming with friends and supporters, he will decide his political future
 unhone kaha ki sapa ko apane jivan ke behtareen pachchis saal dene ke baad vah use chhodane ke liye babari masjid dhahaane ke dauraan uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri rahe kalyaan singh se party ke haath milaane ke kaaran majaboor hue hai
 Azam described Kalyan Singh as the killer of 6 December 1992 and said that this is the reason why he cannot stay with him in the SP
 unhone amar singh kaa naam liye bina kaha ki party main in dinon dallalon, puunjipatiyon or bollywood ke logon kaa dabadabaa he isliye usamen unke jaise garib evam aam aadmi ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 a Delhi court has sentenced the accused to 18 months imprisonment for threatening to chase a student and throw acid on her
 metropolitan magistrate shivani chouhan ne abhiyukt saiyad arshad kadri par 10 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana bhi lagaaya he
 Qadri, a UP resident, was convicted under various sections of the Indian Penal Code
 adaalat ne ladki ke bayaan par bharosa karte hue kaha ki abhiyojan ne bina kisi andeh ke aarope sabit kar diya he
 The court held Kadriko guilty and said that he followed the girl while going to college
 ladki vahaan jan sanchaar kii chaatra thi
 The accused had blocked the way of the student several times
 us par tejaab phenkane or apharan karne kii dhamkee bhi di thi
 The court rejected Kadriki's argument that the girl implicated him in the case
 ladki ne ek disambar 2010 ko shikaayat darj karaayi thi ki kadri ek maheene tak uskaa peechha karata rahaa or galigalouj karne ke saath dhamkee bhi di
 Qadri said that he was friendly with the girl but the brother of the girl did not like him, he has been implicated in the case
 lekin adaalat uski ye daleel maanane se inkaar kar diya

 The protesters have declared a protest against the issuance of domicile certificate, or domicile certificate, to these refugees
 vahiaiylgavaadiyonke saath-saath rajya ke kai vipakshi dal bhi sarkaar ke is faisle kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 He says that this step of the government is not only an attempt to settle these refugees in Kashmir, but it will give them permanent citizenship of the state
 rajya sarkaar ne domissile certificate kii khabar ko galat batayine arapon ke baad sarkaar ne saaf kiya ki in sharnaarthiyon ko domissile nahin, balki keval pahchaan patr die gaye hai, taaki 1947 ke baad jammu kashmir aae in pakistani sharnaarthiyon ko naukariyaan milane main aasaani ho
 In a statement issued by the Mehbooba government of the state, the reports of giving domicile certificate are wrong
 rajya sarkaar ke pravaktaa evam shiksha mantri naeem akhtar ne bayaan main kaha, 'aisa lag rahaa he ki jaan-boojhkar ek muhim chalaai ja rahi he, jiskaa makasad rajya sarkaar kii chhavi or rajya ke halaat ko bigaadna he
 However, BJP, the pdp's ally in the state government, wants these refugees to get citizenship
 vahiin jammu kashmir bijepi ke adhyaksh sat sharma kehete hai, aaj sawaal pashchimi pakistan ke sharnaarthiyon ko domissile certificate dene kaa nahin, balki unki jeevika kaa he
 According to the agenda of the BJP-PDP coalition government, the Center has allocated some jobs for them
 'vahiin kendriya rajyamantri jitendra singh kehete hai, 'iskaa dharm se koi lenaa-dena nahin, pashchim pakistan ke in sharnaarthiyon ke prati raashtra kaa kartavya he ki unhen sammanjanak jeevika muhaiyaa karai jaae
 With this, he said that the separatists are just using this as an excuse to incite tension in the state
 gauratlab he ki 1947 main bantwaare ke samay in sharnaarthiyon ne jammu aakar panaah lee thi
 Today their number is around 80 thousand
 in logon ko jammu-kashmir kii naagarikta nahin he or unhen yahaan matdaan kaa adhikaar nahin mila he

 maharashtra main sarkaar banane kii atakalein tejasanjay raut ne bijepi ko yaad dilaayaa vaada‘50-50 formule ke tahat banani chahie sarkaar’maharashtra main raajnneetik dangal jari he, shivasena or bhartiya janata party ke bich mukhyamantri pad ko lekar khinchataan chal rahi he
 Now Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has once again reminded BJP to follow coalition religion
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki bhaajapa ko 50-50 formule ko nibhaana chahie, jiskaa matlab cabinet main baraabar kii hissedari he
 He also opened his cards on speculation of going with NCP and said that options remain open in politics
 shivasena saansad ne kaha ki do rajyon main chunaav the, haryana main bijepi ne bina bahumat ke hi sarkaar bana lee he
 He has joined hands with an organization which was against him
 unhone kaha ki ab agar sarkaar banane main deree ho rahi he, to hamaari galati nahin he
 On going with NCP, Sanjay Raut said that we have not considered it yet, it will be too early
 haalanki, saath hi unhone ye bhi kaha ki raajnneeti main sab sambhav he, vikalp hameshaa khule rahete hai jaise abhi aapako haryana main dekhne ko mila he
 Sanjay Raut said that there was talk of ending the opposition before the election, but what happened
 bina CM pad ke maanegi shivasena?sanjay raut ne kaha ki gathbandhan kaa dharm nibhaana jaruri he, ham satta ke bhukhe nahin hai
 This was decided before the Lok Sabha elections, which means an equal stake in the cabinet post
 unhone kaha ki hamen dhai saal ke liye mukhyamantri pad kyon nahin milanaa chahie, ham sabhi ram main vishwaas rakhte hai to ram kii tarah praan jaae par vachan naa jaae kii niti apnaani chahie
 On forming the government, he said who is stopping the BJP to form the government with 105 seats, if it happens then it will be a world record
 kyonki sarkaar ke liye 145 kaa aankada chahie
 If someone wants to kill democracy, it will not do
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra main sarkaar banane ko lekar kavayad shuru ho gai he
 On Monday, Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis had a separate meeting with the governor, though it was described as a normal meeting only on Diwali

 com / rj2fxdyhwn Shiv Sena and BJP, who have been making statements against each other for a long time, have once again become tu-tu main-main
 mumbai main BMC ke kaarykram ke dauraan shivasena or bijepi ke parshad aapas main bhid gaye
 During this meeting Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray was also present
 shivasena saansadon ne piem modi ke khilaaf narebaaji bhi kii
 Actually, in this meeting, this debate started over the advance check of BMC after the implementation of GST
 bahes ke baad se hi bijepi parshadon ne modi-modi ke naare lagaae
 So the Shiv Sena corporators started shouting slogans like thieves, thieves, door to door thieves
 shivasena ke parshad kishori padnekar ne aarope lagaaya he ki bijepi ke netaa ne chilla kar kaha ki bala sahab chor he
 But this charge will be dismissed by the BJP
 vahiin jis samay uddhav thakare bhaashan de rahe the, us samay kai bijepi parshad baithak chhod kar chale gaye
 Let me tell you that there has been tension between Shiv Sena and BJP for some time
 haal hi main madhya pradesh main andolan ke mudde par bhi shivasena ne apane sampadakeey main kaha tha ki amit shah to mahatma gandhi par tippanee kar rahe the, vahiin unki party ke varisht netaa apane rajya kii samasyaon ko sulajhane ke liye gandhivadi tareekon kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 However, PM Modi was also praised recently
 saamana main likhaa gaya he ki rajya sarkaar ne jis tarah vipaksh ke sabhi netaaon or duusare pakshon se baatcheet kar kisaan karj maafee kaa rasta nikaala wo tarif ke kaabil he
 The farmer will always be indebted to the government
 haalanki sampadki main karj maafee se rajya sarkaar par padane vaale boj kii chintaa par mukhyamantri kii aalochana bhi kii
 After PM Modi's 'informal' meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, neither any statement will be issued nor any agreement will be signed but this meeting is very important
 bharat aane se pehle china ke raashtrapati(xi Jinping) kii mulaakaat pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan se buudhvaar ko hui thi
 In which he said that China is 'keeping a close watch' on the situation in Kashmir and 'this is clear'
 saath hi, unhone ummid jataai ki 'sambanddh paksh' shantipurna vaarta ke jariye is maamle ko sulajhaa sakate hai
 The Chinese President (xi Jinping) assured Imran Khan during the meeting that the friendship between China and Pakistan is unbreakable and rock-solid despite changes in international and regional conditions
 lekin china ke raashtrapati ke is bayaan par bharat ne kadaa bayaan diya tha jisamen kaha gaya ki yah puri tarah se bharat kaa aantarik or samprabhu maamla he or bhartiya samvidhan se judaa hua he
 No other country has anything to do with this
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha, 'bharat kaa paksh atal bana hua he or spasht he ki jammu evam kashmir bharat kaa aantarik mudda he
 China is well aware of our side
 bharat ke aantarik maamalon par kisi anya desh ko tippanee karne kaa koi haq nahin he
 'along with this, he said that the matter of Kashmir and Article 370 is not included in the talks of xi-modi (xi Jinping- PM Modi) to be held on October 11-12 and if Xi would like to know more about the case, he would get detailed information about it
 will be given
 isi tarah kuch maheene pehle france main yojit ji-20 sammelan main se itar jab america ke raashtrapati donald trump or piem modi se mulaakaat hone vaali thi to usase pehle america ke raashtrapati ne jammu-kashmir ke mudde par madhyasthata kaa raag alapa tha
 After his statement, this meeting had become very important but PM Modi had said clearly in a meeting with Donald Trump that India does not want any third party intervention on Jammu and Kashmir
 saath hi yah bhi kaha tha ki anuchhed 370 hataanaa bharat kaa aantarik maamla he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India and Pakistan were together before 1947 and he believed that the two neighbors could discuss their problems and solve them
 piem ne kisi tisare paksh kii madhyasthata kii gunjaaish ko sire se khaarij kar diya or kaha ki donon desh sabhi muddon par charchaa kar samaadhaan kar sakate hai
 Although Kashmir is not on the agenda in a meeting with PM Modi and the President of China in Mahabalipuram, but since it is an informal meeting, it may be that the issue may arise during normal talks
 aise main is baat par bhi najar rahegi ki piem modi ne jis tarah america ke raashtrapati ko samajha diya tha vaise hi china ke raashtrapati ko bhi jammu-kashmir ke masale par avgat kara denge

 divilliars ne kaha, ‘mujhe isse koi fark nahin padataa ki main apane kariyar kaa 100waan match kahaan khel rahaa hum, jaisaa ki maine 50wein match ko lekar bhi koi mahatv nahin diya tha
 But playing in Bangalore is special for me

 De Villiers, however, admitted that since South Africa has so far managed to win the Test series in other countries, but it has not yet had a chance to win the series in India, it would be special to achieve this feat for the first time

 chini smartphone mekar oneplus isi saal 5G smartphone launch karne kii taiyaari main he
 Recently, it has been reported that the company is launching oneplus 7T Pro soon
 lekin ab is nai report se philhal ek kanfusion ban gaya he ki company oneplus 7T Pro ko hi 5G ke saath laaegi yaa phir is saal do nae smartphone ek baar phir se launch kiye jaaenge
 oneplus CEO Pete Lau told the Financial Times that the company will launch a new 5G capacitive device in the fourth quarter of this year
 yani oktober se lekar disambar tak company 5G smartphone launch kar sakati he
 Let us tell you that during the Mobile World Congress, oneplus saw the concept of 5G smartphone in Barcelona

 So far, we have been hearing that when it is about love, length, leather tone, eye color, hair color, language, etc
, does not matter
 lekin ek taaja adhyayan ne is avadharana ko galat sabit kar diya he
 According to this study, women are more attracted towards tall men due to femininity and protection
 texas sthit rice vishvavidhyalay main samajashaastra ke praadhyaapak maaikel emresan, elin or gladis cline ne kaha ki vikasaatmak manovigyaan siddhant ke anusaar maanav main apane jodidar ke chunaav main samanta sabase bade kaarak kii bhoomika adaa karata he
 According to the data given in this study, a woman's desire for protection and a sense of femininity work behind the attraction of a tall man
 adhyayan main ek mahila ke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki ladki hone ke naate, main ek hi samay main khud ko najuk or surakshit mahasoos karnaa pasand karti hum
 It feels strange to think of yourself as a lover in the eyes of my lover
 mahila ne aage kaha ki main bhi use apni bahon main lenaa chaahati hum or uske gale main apni bahen daalana chaahati hum
 However, men have been rarely heard to say anything about the love affair with length and those who say it have been heard to give priority to women of short length
 haalanki ve itani choti mahila ke saath bhi prem nahin karnaa chaahate, jiske saath shaareerik talmail na baith sake
 According to George Yancey, Professor of Sociology at the University of North Texas, it is believed that being tall brings positivity in the personality of men, while it is a personal responsibility for a woman if she is tall
 yah adhyayan shodh patrika 'femily ishyus' ke taaja ank main prakashit hua

 God bless u always kabhi roti or beti ke rishte se jude bharat or nepal ke sambandhon main padi daraar ke bich ab nepal ke netaa china kaa gungan karte najar aa rahe hai
 In many cases, India has given all possible help to Nepal, but the leaders of Kathmandu seem to like Beijing more than New Delhi
 nepali congress ke saansad vinod choudhary to bharat ko salaah dene lage hai ki use apane padosiyon ko saath lekar chalanaa hoga
 Billionaire businessman and Nepali Congress MP Vinod Chaudhary is on a tour of India and during exclusive talks with Aaj Tak, he said that political developments in the past have led to some misunderstandings between the two countries
 ajtak se baatcheet main nepali congress saansad vinod choudhary ne kaha, " bharat or nepal ke bich dooriyaan achaanak nahin ai hai
 India and Nepal have a bread-and-daughter relationship
 bharat or nepal ke bich kaa rishta vyapaar se lekar saanskrithik str tak rahaa he, lekin yah concystant nahin rahaa
 "in response to the sudden breakdown in the relationship between the two countries, the Nepalese MP says that when the relationship is strong then it also has a lot of expectations and expectations, especially with a country that is strong, capable and has all the means Are present
 nepal lagaataar kai baar bure daur se gujarata rahaa
 The Nepalese MP himself also says that gun rebels created instability in Nepal for almost 12 years
 modi ke nepal daure se kya badla?nepali sansad ke sadsy vinod choudhary ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki jab pradhanmantri modi nepal daure par gaye to unke 40 minute ke sansad ke bheetar hue bhaashan ke baad puraa nepal unase prabhavit hua tha or nepal main sadakon par har har modi or ghar ghar modi ke naare lagane lage
 Vinod Chaudhary says that the Prime Minister's speech changed the mood of the whole of Nepal
 nepali netaa kaa aarope he ki nepal main chal rahe madheshi andolan ke dauraan bharat ne blocade karke nepal ko jo supplai roki, uske chalate donon deshon ke bich rishto main kadavaahat bad gai
 Vinod Chaudhary said, "the blockade was done in Nepal in the name of the way Madheshi issues were uprooted during the Madheshi movement, even when there was such a big earthquake like Nepal in which about 7 lakh houses were destroyed
 Were
 "madheshiyon ke adhikaar kii ladaai par sawaal kyon?madheshiyon kii andolan par jhootha propaganda failaakar bharat ko badnaam karne kii koshish kyon kii gai jabaki madheshi apane andolan main nepal ke samvidhan main apana adhikaar chaahate the ke sawaal par vinod choudhary kaa jawaab tha ki haal hi main jo nepal main chunaav hue hai use dekh lijie
 India also accepted the election and in 7 states of Nepal, Madheshis have won half the percentage in only one state
 desh main jisaki jitani ripregentation hoti he use usee hisaab se adhikaar milte hai
 The Nepali Parliament alleges that the attitude of India to the Madheshis during the Madheshi movement was a major reason, which led to bitterness in the relationship between the two countries and the blockade situation that broke the hearts of the Nepalese
 china kaa gungan kyon?china se kareebi banane par nepali saansad vinod choudhary ne jawaab diya ki har desh ke saath raste khule hone chahie
 1800 km borders with India
 lekin agar china hamen transit coridor detaa he, vyapaar ke liye rasta kholta he or railway link ke saath nepal ko jodta he or hamaari mushkilon ke dauraan hamen doosraa opshan detaa he to isamen koi buraai nahin he
 "however he also said that relations between the two countries cannot be compared as India has its own place and China has its own place
 haalanki unka yah kahana he bharat ke saath rishte kaa ek apana mahatv he
 After Prime Minister Modi's visit, India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has also visited Nepal three times and the newly elected Prime Minister will soon visit India
 vahiin yah baat kehane se nepali saansad nahin chuke ki kisi bhi swadhin raashtra ke liye uskaa swabhimaan sabase bada hota he
 Is Nepal falling prey to China's propaganda? In response to this question, the Nepali MP says that it is not about propaganda because China is not going to help Nepal by going out of the box
 nepal ke vikaas main china kaa apana yogadan he, vah chaahe bhugolic ho yaa saanskrithik ho
 China is undertaking major development projects in Nepal and is connecting it under a belt one road project
 yah nepal ke liye bhi bahut mahatvapurn he
 Vinod Chaudhary says that the way China is investing money in Nepal is building big transit road is very important for Nepal
 nepal kaa gungan kyon?is par nepali saansad ne kaha ki aisa nahin he ham to bas santulit rishton main vishwaas karte hai
 Vinod Chaudhary says that India has to understand Nepal's sentiment
 nepaliyon kii bhavanaaen or nepal ke vikaas kii chaah ko samajhnaa hoga or us par khara utarana hoga
 Accusing India, the Nepali Parliament says that whenever a new government is formed in Nepal in 25 years, the name of India comes, when a government falls, the name of India also comes
 ab sirf yah kehane se kaam nahin chalegaa ki bharat se nepal ke liye yah kiya-vah kiya
 Nepali MP says that India, which is the third growing economy of the world, is called India as a power house and in such a situation, it has raised the bread-daughter relationship with the small countries that are engaged with it

 nepali saansad bharat ko naseehat de rahe hai ki use apane nepal jaise sabhi padosiyon ko saath lekar chalanaa hoga

 The struggle has been going on for several days, the struggle has been going on between the tribals and the CPM for the last several days and the administration seems to be mute spectators throughout the episode
 adivasee sipiem ke logon ke daftaron or gharon ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai or sadakon par unka kabja he
 The tribals seem to be in a full-blown mood and Lalgarh in western Midnapore looks like a battleground

 Things are not right from the team to the Sri Lanka Cricket Board, which is also increasing the displeasure of the fans

 The government has the last chance to pass the triple talaq bill in the winter session, it will be interesting to see if the government is able to succeed in this effort today
 loksabhaa main bahumat ke dam par sarkaar ne aasaani se bill paas kara liya, lekin rajyasabha main sarkaar alpamat main he or use bill paas karaane ke liye vipakshi dalon kii madad chahie, jiscongresane loksabhaa main bill ko lekar kuch nahin kaha, ab vahi rajyasabha main apni takat dikhaa rahi he or anya dalon ke saath bill ko select cameti main bhejne kii maang kar rahi he
 It is being said from the government that the bill cannot be referred to the Select Committee (select Committee) as the Supreme Court has declared triple talaq as unconstitutional and the judges of the court had stayed the triple talaq for six months
 And that period is being completed on 22 February
 jabaki vipaksh kaa kahana he ki 6 maheene kii avadhi bill paas hone kii taarikh se maani jaaegi
 Reasons for the government's fear of the committee: Why is the government so afraid and avoiding being sent to the select committee to whom the opposition is seeking to send the Muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill-2017 bill? The Committees of the Parliament, ie, Parliamentary Committees, are also constituted to maintain effective control over the official functioning
 sansadeey samitiyaan do tarah kii hoti hai, tadarth or sthaayee
 The ad hoc committee is constituted for a particular case or purpose, its existence remains till it completes its work in the matter and submits the report to the House
 jabaki sthaayee samiti kaa kaam fiks hota he
 There are several types of standing committees such as Public Accounts Committee, Estimates Committee, Privileges Committee and Government Assurance Committee
 vibhageeya aadhaarit 24 tarah kii sthaayee samitiyaan hoti hai jisamen 21 loksabhaa or 10 rajyasabha ke sadsy hote hai
 The number of members in each committee varies
 iske alaava anya tarah kii sthaayee samiti bhi hoti hai
 There are two types of ad hoc committees as the Select Committee and the Joint Committee, both of these committees have to consider the bill (bills) presented in the House, but not necessarily on behalf of the House, both these committees have all the Bills
 But should be sent for consideration
 pravar samiti bheje gaye bill ke sabhi maamalon par gambhirtha se vichaar karti he
 After consideration, the committee can give its suggestions on any matter
 yah samiti bill se sambandhit sanghathanon, visheshgyon or anya logon se unki raay le sakati he
 After intense deliberations on the bill, the Select Committee submits the report to the House with its amendments and suggestions
 agar samiti kaa koi sadsy sambandhit bill par asahmat hota he to uski asahmati bhi report ke saath bheji ja sakati he
 The government knows that the opposition will dominate the select committee and will also insist on getting the amendments given by it
 majabuuran sarkaar ko rajyasabha ke sanshodhano ko maan leti he, to us surat main bill ko phir se loksabhaa main bhejnaa hoga
 In such a situation, the possibility of passing the bill soon will be lost, while the term towards the Supreme Court is ending on 22 February
 donon sadanon main bill kaa paas hona jaruriagar teen talaak se judaa yah bill vipaksh pravar samiti ke paas bhijwane ko lekar adi rahi to sarkaar ise sansad ke maujuuda sheetakaaleen satr main paarit nahin karvaa sakegi
 Anyway, today is the last day in the cold session
 kisi bhi bill ko kanoon kaa rup lene ke liye ise donon sadanon se paas karwaanaa jaruri hota he
 The bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 28 December which passed after a long debate lasting 7 hours
 bahes ke baad kai sanshodhan bhi pesh kiye gaye, lekin sadan main sab khaarij kar die gaye

 Amit Shah, bjp's PM in waiting and close to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, has said that where Modi will contest in Lok Sabha elections is not yet decided
 amit shah ne saaf kar diya ki ram mandir mudda bijepi ke agenda main nahin he
 In an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak, bjp's in-charge of UP and former Gujarat Home Minister Amit Shah said, 'from where Narendra Modi will contest the election is not certain
 iskaa faisla party karegi
 'when he was asked if he would try the luck in UP himself, he said that this is a later thing, now his focus is in the publicity
 amit shah ne kaa ki ram mandir mudda bijepi ke agenda main nahin he
 Our editor-at-large Rahul Kanwal has spoken to Amit Shah
 pesh hai unase baatcheet ke mukhya ansh:aapane jindagi bhar gujarat main raajnneeti kii, aapako narendra modi kii vajah se itani badi jimmevary di gai, desh kaa sabase bada rajya, sabase jatil rajya, uskaa banaaya gaya apko incharge
 The people wondered whether Amit Shah would really understand UP politics so soon
 
 
 gujarat kii to bipoalr raajnneeti he, upi ke complex raajnneeti ko kya aap itani jaldi samaj paaenge?amit shah -dekhie, wo to chunaav ke nattejey jab aaenge tabhi pataa chalegaa
 But i am sure, with the confidence that the party has entrusted me with this responsibility, i will overcome the stamina and we will return to Uttar Pradesh as the largest party
 kyon di gai aapako itani badi jimmedaari, kya he aapkaa or modi kaa rishta aisa ki aap modi ke daahine haath maane jate hai?amit shah -dekhie do sawaal alag-alag he
 Why did you ask Rajnath Singh ji and ask the big leaders of the party
 meraa kaam he jo party mujhe jimmedaari de, us kaam ko mujhe mere andar jitani bhi kshamta he, kshamta kaa sahi tarah se upyog karte hue main nibhaaunga
 And as far as Modi ji is concerned, Modi ji has nothing special, he likes those who do more work
 or swabhaavik rup se jo zyada kaam karata he use zyada mauka miltaa he
 You speak directly
 sidhi-sidhi baat honi chahie, aisa na kahie ki aap unke khaas nahin hai
 The whole country is watching you right now, everyone knows Modi, Amit Shah too and the country's politics
 yah bataaiye ki uttar pradesh par fatah karne kii aapaki stritegi kya he?amit shah - dekhie, vaise uttar pradesh par fatah karnaa is baar koi badi baat he nahin
 There are three reasons for this - Firstly, there is a wave of big anti-incumbency against the UPA government all over Uttar Pradesh, inflation and corruption, security of the country and poor administration
 isse log trast hai to sarkaar badalane kaa mood vaise hi bana he
 The second reason is that against the government of Uttar Pradesh, anti-incumbency is also at full peak and people are suffering from the misrule of both SP and BSP
 basapa kaa kushasan aaj bhi logon ko yaad he, sapa kaa kushasan aaj bhi chal rahaa he or bijepi ke alaave logon ke paas koi chaara nahin he
 If the government is to change at the Center, neither SP can change, nor can the BSP change, only BJP can change and this time the wave of change is highest in the country, then it is in Uttar Pradesh
 par dharna yah he ki amit shah ko uttar pradesh is vajah se bheja gaya he taaki vahaan hindu polarigeshan ho
 On the ground, below the surface, Amit Shah is sending a message about how Muslims are being appropriated, trying to connect Hindus
 kya yahi amit shah kii ranneeti he ki modi ke naam par hinduon ko jodo?amit shah -dekhie, main sidhe sanghathan ke liye kaam kar rahaa hum magar upi ke halaat, jo log sarkaar main hai, unheen logon ne aise banaae hai ki mujhe lagata he chunaav aate-aate kmayunalise ho jayega
 The government has recommended the release of 21 lawsuits against the hardcore terrorists who were in jail at different times, and those who are in jail
 main kabhi soch hi nahin saktaa, samvidhan ke tahat chalane vaali sarkaar is tarah kaa kaai step le sakati he kya
 Due to appearances in day-to-day work and development work also, the majority of the population who are Hindus, resent the administration
 mujhe kuch karne kii jarurat nahin he, muslim episment karne ke chakkar main hinduon ko naaraaz karne kaa kaam mulaayam ne kar diya he
 You are saying, Mulayam's government, Akhilesh's government is polarizing things
 lekin hamane mujjafarnagar ke dangon main dekha, aapkaa vidhayak tha sangeet som jo ki jhooth-mooth ke farji clip circulet kar rahaa tha, taaki logon main yah bhaavana paidaa ho minarity kmaunity ke khilaaf
 Who was doing this work for your party? Amit Shah - This is the version of the police, let this matter go to the cart once
 ek dfa bhi sangeet som ne nahin kaha ki unhone nahin kiya he?amit shah - is baat ko court main jane dijie, bahes hone dijie, aap sabko maaloom chal jayega ki yah farji mukadmaa he
 And why are you just watching the clip, why did the administration not take immediate action on the incident that happened, if the action was taken immediately, that thing was immediately buried there
 kyon riection aayaa, riection isliye aayaa ki prashasan ne ekatarfa kaarywahi kii
 When there is such a feeling in the mind of a large number that the administration takes unilateral action, injustice is being done, then it is natural for people to get angry
 agar ek tarafa kaarywahi nahin hoti to kuch nahin hona tha vahaan par
 Such incidents happen across the country, but nothing happens except in Uttar Pradesh
 kyonki police apana kaam karti he, wo na jati dekhati he, na dharm dekhati he
 But the police in Uttar Pradesh is working on seeing religion today, due to which polarization has taken place
 par lag rahaa he ki uttar pradesh main is vakt ek dabl game chal rahaa he
 On one side is Narendra Modi who says that the toilet should come first, the temple later
 duusari taraf aap hai, aap jate hai, pehla kaam aapane yah kiya ki aap ayodhya gaye, aapane kaha ki ram mandir yaheen banegaa
 Vinay Katiyar stands on the stage of Kanpur and says that Hindutva is the issue of Ram temple in elections
 baaki bijepi ke netaa ekadam chupp hai to ye kya game chal rahaa he
 On the name of Hidutva, on the name of Ram temple
 saaf-saaf bataaiye ki ram mandir aapke agenda par he ki nahin?amit shah - dekhie, hamaare rashtriya adhyaksh ji ne baar-baar is baat ko spasht kiya he media ke saamne ki ram mandir hamaara chunavi agenda nahin he
 Even after this, i think no one other than the media is saying that Ram temple is on our agenda
 aap sabase pehle ayodhya gaye or sabase pehle aapane kaha ki ham sabaki ye bhaavana he or yaheen par banaaenge ram mandir?amit shah - aapane meri baat ko yaa to thik se suna nahin, yaa to aap galat tareeke se pesh kar rahe hai
 i said that i have prayed before Ram Bhagwan that the country should be free from misrule, Congress should become a free India and a big Ram temple should be built here with everyone's consent
 na bijepi kii koi baat kii thi, na hi chunavi agenda kii koi baat kahi thi
 As far as my prayer is concerned, it is my right and i still say that in front of Ram Lala i prayed that with the consent of everyone, a grand Ram temple should be built there and Ram Lala is in a good place, one Visit the grand place
 aapane kaha ki ram mandir aapke liye chunavi mudda nahin he to hindutv, uttar pradesh main khaskar ke, amit shah ke liye, narendra modi ke liye kitna mahatvapurn he?amit shah – dekhie meri party ki polisy he ki kisi kaa episment mat kiijie, sabake saath nyaay kiijie
 There are two things in this, do not judge anyone and do justice to all
 isamen agar kisi kaa episment hota he to apane aap duusare chor kii bhavanaaen ubharkar upar aati hai
 i cannot stop this, if anyone is guilty for this, then the applicant is about to do it
 aap bhi to tool de rahe hai us bhaavana ko
 Amit Shah - There is no question of touting
 jo jan bhaavana he use bijepi ricolect karegi, usko aawaaj degi
 It is the job of us to give voice to public sentiments, and there will be injustice to anyone, understand my point properly, if there is injustice to anyone, BJP will raise it out loud? You did not answer my question
 hindutv kaa aapke chunaav main kya role he
 Amit Shah - The incident which is being done by the government
 usase duusare chhod kii bhavanaaen aahat ho rahi hai or wo sarphase par aa gaya
 Someone has instigated it, there is no such thing
 ection jo sarkaar kaa he vahi duusare chor kii bhaawanaaon ko uksaa rahaa he
 It is the same thing with action and reaction
 amit shah – sarkaar ke episment vaale ection se duusare chor par riection hua he or bhaavana riect hokar sarphase par aayi he
 You have a strategy to project Narendra Modi as a backward leader and say that this is the first time that a backward person becomes the Prime Minister of the country, so those who are backward should also vote for Narendra Modi
 meri kuch varisht netaaon se baat hui jo aapke pratiddandi hai, unka kahana he ki aise hi naam lene se yaa jati ke naam par koi obisi netaa nahin ban jaataa, kariyar main narendra modi ne abtak kya kiya he jiske aadhaar par janata ko lage ki vaaki main koi netaa he jo obisi he?amit shah – dekhie bijepi modi ji ko kisi ek varg ke netaa ke taur par project nahin kar rahi
 But it is true that Modi ji comes from very backward class
 duusari baat aapane kaha ki modi ji ne kuch nahin kiya
 Let me tell you one thing with the claim that OBC is the happiest in Gujarat under Modi ji's 12 years rule, in terms of education, and his empowerment - in all the three things, if OBC is comfortable anywhere, then i Feel free to say that they are in Gujarat
 or is 12 saal main modi kaa shashan rahaa he
 So Modi did nothing but this is not right for obcs
 modi ke shashan main hi gujarat main obisi bade paimaane par aage aae hai, unka empowerment hua he
 And as far as Uttar Pradesh is concerned, the obcs are very angry with the three parties today because the three parties talk about religion-based reservation and if religion-based reservation comes, then the cap of 50 percent is due to the SC / ST
 Will not go, because that constitution is protected and the reservation which will be less will be of OBC
 aap phir se khauf paidaa kar rahe hai
 Amit Shah - No, i am not creating fear, i am telling the reality
 maine kabhi clem nahin kiya he ki 18 pratishat aarakshan minerities ko denge
 My party is against it
 ye samvidhan sammat nahin he ki kisi bhi dharm vishesh ko aarakshan diya jaae
 Yet the parties are hurting it in the greed of votes
 iskaa riection obisi main jarur he
 The obcs are angry that there is talk of snatching the mouth of our mouth and giving it to the minorities
 musalamaanon main kaaphi shankaa he narendra modi ko lekar
 According to you, if Narendra Modi becomes Prime Minister, what will be his relationship with minority
 amit shah – modi satta ke liye koi fahrren element nahin hai
 Modi ji has been in power in Gujarat for thirteen years
 or koi chunauti nahin he or bharat sarkaar ne jo kamishan apvanyat kiya, us kamishan kii report main, (sachhar kamishan kii baat kar rahaa hum main) to us report ke hisaab se musalmaan agar sabase zyada kahin sukhi hai to wo state gujarat he
 As far as the minorities are concerned, when the electricity goes throughout the state, the houses of the minority will also be electrified
 puure state main road banate hai to uskaa upyog minerity ke log bhi karte hai, puure state ke shiksha kaa apgredation hota he to uskaa upyog minerity ke bacchon ke liye bhi hoga
 Get out of the cycle of minority and majority, this Era is over in India
 deveopment ke aadhaar par puraa hindustan vot karne ja rahaa he
 But the reality is that Muslim polarization is happening right now
 modi ke naam par duusari partiyaan khauf paidaa kar rahi hai or musalamaanon main bhi ashanka, chintaa he modi ko lekar
 So why doesn't Modi do a little bit out
 kai logon ne kaha ki 2002 ke dangon ke liye agar wo tahe dil se maafee maangate hai to shaayad musalamaanon main jo chintaa he modi ko lekar wo unke dil se dur ho jaaegi?amit shah – musalamaanon kii chintaa ko kam karne ki jimmevary ham par chhod dijie
 No Muslim is angry or angry, the more the opposition parties propagate it, the more will be their loss
 jaise ham dekh rahe hai ki simbelism kaaphi ho gaya he
 We saw before many rallies that a notice came out from the BJP that you should come wearing a cap, you should wear a sherwani
 ye tamaasha karne ki kya jarurat he
 Amit Shah - This is all about the media
 nahin, hamaare paas chitthee he
 We showed Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi that the BJP Minority Committee has letters in which it was said that if you come for the rally, you should try
 amit shah – dekhie, ye chitti yaa to farji he, yaa to nijee taur par kisi neeche ke kaaryakarta ne ati utsaah main aakar kiya hoga
 The party has neither given any such information nor has any such effort been made by the party
 aap kehete he ki aap simbelism ke khilaaf he or phir aap kehete hai ki topi pahan kar aaiye
 Amit Shah - i want to deceive absolutely no such effort from the party
 party main kisi vyakti ne nijee taur par kiya hoga
 But i authorize it authoritatively, the party did not make any such effort, never will
 aapke hisaab se upi main amit shah ke jane se kitna fark padaa he, kitni aapaki haalat sudhar gai he
 If elections are held today, how many seats will BJP get
 amit shah – amit shah ke jane se koi fark nahin padaa he
 There is a big difference in the name of Narendra Modi
 kyonki jin chizon se anti inkambaisi jenerate hua, un sabhi chizon kaa jawaab log modi main dekh rahe hai
 i would not like to go with the seats
 chunaav main der he
 The candidates have also not been declared by all the parties
 magar main itnaa puure vishwaas se kah saktaa hum ki upi main bijepi sabase badi party banane ja rahi he
 Which seat of UP will Narendra Modi contest
 amit shah – narendra modi ne kahaan se chunaav ladanaa he wo abhi tay nahin hua he
 Modi has never decided his seat on his own
 ye party tay karegi
 You will challenge aap ladoge upi se
 Amit Shah - It is too late for me to fight or not fight
 abhi to mujhe upi kaa sanghathan thik karnaa he
 There are top leaders in so many BJP
 kai upi se aate hai
 So why was this responsibility given to you? sabase bada chalange amit shah ko hi kyon diya gaya?amit shah – maine bhi bahut sochaa, lekin mere paas samay kii bahulata he, isse zyada mujhe kuch nahin lagata
 Let us, on one hand, Amit Shah is active in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, on the one hand there is a history of Amit Shah
 ek aisa itihaas jisamen aap par chargeshit he
 You have very serious cases
 charchaa yah ho rahi he ki duusari ishrat chargeshit main aapkaa naam ho saktaa he
 You are worried about career? Amit Shah - Look, i am not worried at all because i do not believe that UP will stop because of me
 upi main lakhon kaaryakarta hai
 Everyone has created an atmosphere together and now no one can stop it
 jahaan tak mujh par aaropon kaa jo sawaal he, ye jo farji chargeshit mujhapar daakhil kii gai he sibiai ke dwaara, usase pehle mujhapar ek bhi mukadmaa mere 49 saal ke jivan main kabhi daayar nahin hua
 This is the first chargesheet, it is also an encounter, an anti-national encounter
 or main daawey se kahata hum ki ye farji chargeshit he or hoicourt ne bhi usko sweekaar kiya he ki koi primafesi cese nahin he, isliye meraa bel diya he or usee fact ko supreme court ne bhi accept kiya he ki koi primafesai cese nahin banataa he
 You just got a vine
 chargeshit agar hoti he, to court ko alag se tay karnaa hoga ki
 
 
 Amit Shah - It is written inside the Judgment of Bell that the CBI lawyer could not put any primafasai case in front of the court, so we give bail
 diji banjaaraa ko aap bahut acchhee tarah se jaanate hai
 He has worked with you for many days
 unhone chitthee likhi, jisamen likhaa ki jo bhi phek ankanutor ki polisy thi gujarat kii wo saare ke saare amit shah kii jaankaree main the
 Amit Shah - Look, there are two things, one thing Banjara did not even write in his letter that these were fake anchors
 unhone ankanutors likhaa he
 And as far as the policy was concerned, the policy of the Government of Gujarat has been kept on the website
 har police stesan main uplabdh he
 It is the policy of the Gujarat government to make every policeman work according to CRPC
 ab aapane apni baat kahi
 You were the Home Minister, Banjara Encounter Specialist
 jab banjaaraa ankanutor specialist nahin rahe or ye baaten nikal kar ain, to kya uske baad lashkar-e-tayba ne narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhana band kar diya kya?amit shah - aapako maaloom nahin, iske baad bhi threat paracepshan he
 Similar IB inputs also came after this
 iske baad aaj bhi central ibi threat paracepshan bhej rahi he
 Even today, if Lashkar or any jihadi organization is its biggest target, it is Narendra Modi
 kyonki mana ye gaya ki thodaa neshnal image dena chaahate the ki wo thode kattar hai, aatankiyon ke khilaaf ladenge, isliye aapane in bichaare logon ko marava diya
 This is said by your rivals? Amit Shah - No Encounter was needed to create an image, you have made it like this
 jaanch ke direction supreme court se aa rahe hai?amit shah - ye jaanch hi raajnneetik he
 The Supreme Court's direction is to conduct a true investigation but the investigation is political, and if a similar investigation is done, not a single politician of the country will be spared from going to jail
 log kehete hai ki agar koi narendra modi kii kamjor kadi ban saktaa he to wo amit shah hai?amit shah - ye samay batayega ki majboot yaa kamjor kadi banegaa
 You do not think Modi took a huge relationship by projecting you
 ye jaanate hue ki aap par kis tarah ke chargeej hai?amit shah - dekhie pehle bhi soharabuddin kaa mudda banaaya, uske baad main gujarat ke chunaav hue, sthaneey nikoyon ke chunaav hue, janata ne ye baat nahin maani
 If she does anything wrong, she will boomerang on them
 baat aapke mishan 272 kii
 Seeing that there is some spark in UP, there is discussion in Bihar, but there are still many political parties who do not want to deal with Narendra Modi? Amit Shah - Even when Atal ji's government was formed earlier We had a low majority, no one was with us then
 jaise hi ham 180 cross kar gaye sab hamaare saath aa gaye
 The figure of 180 is a magical figure in the history of Hindustan, the one who crosses 180 is a good figure
 180 jo cross nahin kar sakate, log unke saath nahin janaa chaahate
 One does not open one's cards naturally before the election
 kyonki uttar or pashchim bharat se ham neeche jate hai to kuch antcheblity he modi ke liye
 It is said that he has good relations with Jayalalithaji, he goes to Chennai two times
 lekin jayalalita nahin milin?amit shah - ye galat baat he
 
 
 You have been a lot of junk in Delhi
 jis tarah se ladaai chal rahi he
 Harshvardhan, Vijay Goyal Is this so embarrassing? Amit Shah - see Divide House you see
 mujhe nahin dikh rahaa he
 When the BJP uses the word, everyone comes from national president to booth worker
 ek jhagada jo aapako dikhaai de rahaa he wo netaa tay hone tak aapako dikhaai degaa
 Vijay Goel may have a spontaneous reaction, but it never happens after the leader is decided in our party
 ham ekajute hokar chunaav ladenge
 You will see, after the leader is decided you will not see any divide
 kejariwal kaa daawa- puure kiye sabhi chunavi vaade2015 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle ghoshnaptr main kiye the 70 vadehamaare desh main lagbhag har saal chunavi mausam rahata he or har baar kuch na kuch chunavi ghoshnaa bhi hoti he
 But which of these promises are fulfilled after the completion of the tenure of the government? It is not accounted for
 zyaadaatar partiyaan agle chunavi ghoshnaptr main puraane vaadon ko doharaati hai
 At the same time, Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal claims that he has fulfilled the promises made before the assembly elections
 darasal buudhvaar ko hi siem kejariwal ne dillivaasiyon ko free vaai-faai dene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 During this time, Kejriwal said that his government has also fulfilled the last election promise of its manifesto and his government is the first government which has fulfilled all its promises
 bataa den ki aam aadmi party ne dilli vidhansabha chunaav 2015 main apane ghoshnaa patr main muft wifai dene kaa vaada kiya tha, jo 16 disambar se puraa hone ja rahaa he
 Announcing this, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal told during the press conference, 'internet has become a basic need'
 ham dilli main internet free karne ja rahe hai
 With this, all the promises of the manifesto will be fulfilled
 'bijli, pani, bas, CCTV or free vaai-faai parkejarivalka vaadawada-aam aadmi party ne bijli bill ko aadhe se kam karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 Along with this, there was also talk of correcting the errors in billing and meters
 parinaam-arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne 200 unit tak kii bijli khapat par zero-bill kaa elaan kar rakhaa he
 Under this scheme, electricity bill of more than 26 lakh electricity consumers came to zero in November last month
 isse pehle oktober maheene main 22 lakh se zyada bijli upabhoktao kaa bill zero aayaa tha
 This has been revealed in the data of BSES and Tata power-ddl, the electricity supply companies
 companiyon ke mutabik thand badhane par 30-35 laakh upabhoktaaon ko iskaa laabh milegaa
 The vaada-aam Aadmi Party had promised to provide up to 20 kiloliters (20,000 liters) of free water per month to every household through the water board meter
 parinaam-dilli waalon ko har maheene 20 hazaar litre pani muft main diya ja rahaa he
 However, the High Court commented on the Delhi government's plan that nothing should be given to anyone for free
 aap chaahe 10 paisa yaa ek paisa kuch bhi jarur charge karen
 At the same time, the NGT (national Green Tribunal) has said that it is being misused in Delhi only because of getting water free
 vaada-saarvajanik parivahan ke badhaave par jor dete hue aam aadmi party ne dilli main baari paimaane par bas sevaaon kaa vistaar karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 It was said that 5,000 new buses will be given to Delhi in a five-year term
 parinaam-kejariwal sarkaar ke mutabik tender ko lekar maamla fansata rahaa
 The government argued that companies should take responsibility for maintenance of buses themselves
 vahiin companiyon kii maang thi ki isaki zimmedaari dilli sarkaar ko leni chahie
 Due to this collision there was a delay in bringing new buses to Delhi
 saal 2019 ke agast maheene main 25, sitambar maheene main 100, oktober maheene main 104 or november maheene main 100 cluster basen laai gayi
 Next year, 60 DTC buses will be brought in January in January, 104 in February, 130 in March, 160 in April and 196 in May
 vaada-dilli main aparaadhon kii rokthaam ke liye saarvajanik sthalon or bason main sisitivi camere lagane kii baat kahi gai thi
 Under the plan, DTC buses, bus stands and crowded places were to be installed CCTV cameras
 parinaam-dilli main pehle charan main 1,40,000 sisitivi camere lagane kii yojana thi
 According to the Kejriwal government, they have completed this work
 ab duusare phej main bhi1,40,000 sisitivi camere lagane kii yojana he
 Only 5 people will have the right to watch CCTV videos
 1
 RWA President 2
 sthaneey PWD adhikari 3
 CCTV installation company BEL 4
 local police thane ke SHO or 5
 PWD Control Room
 vaada-shiksha or rojgaar ko protsaahan dene ke liye dilli main vaai-faai kii suvidha dene kii baat bhi kahi gai thi
 Result - Kejriwal government will install 11 thousand wi-fi hot spots in the first phase
 is yojana par 100 karod rupee kharch honge
 This will enable 2
2 million people to use the Internet simultaneously
 siem kejariwal ne bataaya he ki 16 disambar se free vaai-faai kii suvidha milane lagegi
 Initially 100 wi-fi hot spots will be installed
 agle chah maheenon main inaki sankhya 11 hajaar tak pahunch jaaegi
 Before the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, Arvind Kejriwal made a total of 70 promises
 inamen se 10 pramukh vaade is tarah hai-1
 Cheap electricity and free drinking water for all sabake liye rojgaar3
 Best Health Facilities 4
 mahilaon kii suraksha5
 Pollution free Delhi 6
 yamuna kii safai, swatchta or saundaryikaran7

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar could not attend Sonia Gandhi's lunch party on Friday to show solidarity between the opposition parties, but a day after that, he is coming to Delhi on Saturday to have lunch with PM Narendra Modi
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke lunch party main hissaa lene ke liye unhone jadyu pratinidhi bheja tha or purv nirdhaarit kaaryakramon ko shirkat nahin kar paane kii vajah bataai thi
 In fact, PM Narendra Modi will organize a luncheon in honor of Mauritius Prime Minister Anirudh Jagannath and he has invited senior leaders like Nitish Kumar to join it
 shuukravaar ko modi sarkaar ke teen saal hone par vipakshi ekajutata dikhaane ke liye congress adhyaksh kii taraf se rakhi gai lunch party main nitish kumaar kii gairmaujuudagi charchaa kaa vishay bani he
 After that, political discussions have intensified after PM Modi's decision to attend the event
 darasal yah aise samay par ho rahaa he jab congress 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar vipakshi dalon ke saath ek mahagathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaen talash rahi he
 However, after the cabinet meeting in Patna, Nitish said that people are unnecessarily misinterpreting not attending Friday's banquet while he told Congress General Secretary Ahmed Patel five days ago that the former national from his party President Sharad Yadav will join and give his opinion on the issues discussed in the meeting organized by Congress President Sonia Gandhi Minister was
 nitish kumaar ne kuch dinon purv hi ye ghoshnaa kar di thi ki raashtrapati chunaav par vartmaan modi sarkaar ko aam sahmati banane ke liye pahal kerani chahie
 And a resolution to this effect was also passed in the meeting on Friday
 lekin nitish ne kaha ki mahagathbandhan ke sabhi faisle kaa wo aadar karte hai
 But after lunch on Saturday, Nitish Kumar admitted that he has separately sought time from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the problem of silt in the Ganges and he has been informed that the meeting will take place after the banquet on Saturday
 nitish ne kaha ki is baithak main unke saath bihar ke mukhya sachiv anjani kumaar singh bhi maujuud rahenge
 Clearing the agenda of this meeting, Nitish said that he is worried about the silt of the river Ganges
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar jis ganga kii aviralata kii baat kar rahi he wo ganga main gaad ke jamaa hone tak sambhav nahin
 Nitish wants the Center to once again send a team to inspect the site to study the problem
 tippaniyan There will be political speculation on the meeting with Prime Minister Modi on Saturday, to which Nitish clarified that it was a tradition to invite him as Prime Minister of Mauritius or Prime Minister of Japan, Bihar Chief Minister even when UPA was in government
 lekin morishas ke saath bihar kaa bhaavnaatamak lagaav he
 Bihar is the origin of 52 percent of its population
 abhi ke pradhanmantri bihar mul ke hai
 On this occasion, Nitish said that he is going to this background
 haalanki rajintik jaankaar maanate hai ki shuukravaar ko agar sonia gandhi ke bhoj main nitish nahin gaye to uske peeche unka apana koi vichaar rahaa hoga or pradhanmantri ke bhoj main 24 ghante ke andar jane ke liye unhone sahmati di he to uske peeche bhi unki koi ranneeti jarur rahi hogi
 But at the moment he does not want to come on any public platform with his colleague Lalu Yadav surrounded in the scam charges
 nitish kumaar haalia varshon main piem narendra modi ke raajnneetik pratidwandvi rahe hai or jab narendra modi ko 2014 ke aam chunaavon se pehle party kaa piem pad ke liye cheharaa banaaya gaya to nitish kumaar ne takreeban do dashak puraane apni party ke gathbandhan ko bijepi ke saath samaapt kar diya tha
 However, in recent times there is some warmth from both sides
 isaki baangi is baat se samajhi ja sakati he ki jab pichley saal notebandi kii ghoshnaa hui thi to sabhi dalon ne piem modi ke is faisle kii aalochana kii thi lekin nitish kumaar ne us kadam kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also then praised the move by Nitish Kumar to declare liquor ban in Bihar
 shuukravaar ko modi sarkaar ke teen saal hone par vipakshi ekajutata dikhaane ke liye congress adhyaksh kii taraf se rakhi gai lunch party main nitish kumaar kii gairmaujuudagi charchaa kaa vishay bani he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also then praised the move by Nitish Kumar to declare liquor ban in Bihar
 haalanki patna main cabinet kii baithak ke baad nitish ne kaha ki shuukravaar ke bhoj main shaamil na hone kaa log anaavashyak hi galat arth laga rahe hai jabaki congress mahasachiv ahamed patel ko unhone paanch din pehle hi bataa diya tha ki unki party kii taraf se purv rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav shaamil honge or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi dwaara yojit baithak main jin muddon par charchaa hui usapar unhone apni raay bataa di thi
 Nitish Kumar had announced a few days ago that the current Modi government should take initiative to build consensus on the presidential election
 or shuukravaar ko baithak main bhi is aashay kaa prastaav paarit kiya gaya
 But Nitish said that he respects all decisions of the grand alliance
 lekin shanivaar ko dopaher ke bhojan ke baad nitish kumaar ne mana ki unhone alag se pradhanmantri narendra modi se ganga nadi main gaad kii samasya par charchaa ke liye samay maanga he or unhen soochna di gayi he ki ye baithak shanivaar ko bhoj ke baad hogi
 Nitish said that Bihar Chief Secretary Anjani Kumar Singh will also be present with him in this meeting
 is baithak ke agenda ko saafe karte hue nitish ne kaha ki wo ganga nadi kii gaad ko lekar chintit hai
 He said that the Ganga, which the central government is talking about, is not possible till the deposition of silt in the Ganges
 nitish chaahate hai ki centre ek baar phir is samasya ke adhyayan ke liye sthal ke nirikshan ke liye ek team bheje
 The comments shanivaar ko pradhan mantri modi ke saath baithak par rajintik atakalein hongi, isapar nitish ne safai di ki jab upie kii sarkaar thi tab bhi morishas ke pradhanmantri hon yaa japan ke pradhanmantri, bihar ke mukhyamantri hone ke naate unhen nimantran die jane kii parampara rahi he
 But Bihar has a sentimental attachment with Mauritius
 vahaan kii 52 pratishat aabaadi kaa mul bihar he
 The present Prime Minister is of Bihar origin
 is avasar par nitish ne kaha ki isi prishthbhumi main wo ja rahe hai
 Although political experts believe that if Nitish did not go to Sonia Gandhi's banquet on Friday, then he must have had his own idea and he has agreed to go to the Prime Minister's banquet within 24 hours, then he must have some strategy behind it too may have been
 lekin ghotaale ke aaropon main ghire apane sahyogi lalu yadav ke saath filhal wo kisi saarvajanik manch par nahin aana chaahate
 Nitish Kumar has been the political rival of PM Narendra Modi in recent years and when Narendra Modi was made the face of the party's PM post before the 2014 general elections, Nitish Kumar ended his two-decade-old alliance with BJP Had done it
 haalanki haalia daur main donon taraf se kuch garmjoshi dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Its hallmark can be understood from the fact that when demonetisation was announced last year, all the parties criticized PM Modi's decision but Nitish Kumar supported that move
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi uske baad nitish kumaar dwaara bihar main sharabbandi kii ghoshnaa ke kadam kii saraahna kii thi
 But after lunch on Saturday, Nitish Kumar admitted that he has separately sought time from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the problem of silt in the Ganges and he has been informed that the meeting will take place after the banquet on Saturday
 nitish ne kaha ki is baithak main unke saath bihar ke mukhya sachiv anjani kumaar singh bhi maujuud rahenge

 'bharat ratna' sitar vadak pandit ravishankar apni patni annapurna devi se jalte the kyonki vah 'unase bhi acha' sitar or surbahaar bajaati thim
 But Annapurna Devi had to strangulate her skills to save her marriage

 Panditji did not like it
 'shaadi or kariyar main se ek ko chunanaa padounhone bataaya ki unki vaivaahik jindagi par iskaa nakaaratmak asar padane laga
 According to Annapurna, Ravi Shankar never stopped him from performing, but in other ways he used to show that he is not happy with his wife getting more praise than himself
 annapurna ne bataaya ki iske baad aise halaat paidaa ho gaye ki unhen apni vaivaahik jindagi or kariyar main se kisi ek ko chunane ke liye majaboor hona padaa or unhone parivaar ko chun liya

 lekin july khatm hote-hote yah kami sirf 11 fisadi hi bachi he
 This will also benefit the agriculture sector

 pakistan ke videsh sachiv salmaan bashir 25 farvari, 2010 ko achaanak 15 second ke liye tivi par makabool ho gaye the jab unhone hafiz said or uske aatanki sanghathan lashkare-taiyaba par bharat dwaara saunpe gaye dogier ko ''mahaj sahitya'' kah kar khaarij kar diya tha
 It was said very neatly and carefully, but its witty tone was clear
 bashir isi 20 june ko pakistan ke ucchayukta ban kar dilli pahunche
 Is it a reward for his literary vocabulary or is it someone in Islamabad who is taking a very funny decision
 baharhaal, sahitya kii maheen pahchaan rakhane vaale bashir ko bhale-bure kii samaj honi chahie
 In fact, the first file reached his office in Delhi is that of Syed Zabiuddin Ansari - an Indian citizen from Beed, who was a special of Hafiz Saeed, who trained the Mumbai attackers on November 26, 2008, and was one of Karachi For three days, sitting in the control room, the destruction was created by the Lashkar terrorists
 sirf ek shaks he jo vaastaviktaa or kahani kaa fark jaanata haih ajmal kasaab
 There have been reports from a Mumbai jail that when he came to know of Ansari's arrest, he was drowned in thinking
 ansaari ziddee nahin he
 The police did not have to torture them to get the secret out of it
 usne raji-khushi sab kuch ugal diya he
 David Headley's investigation in America or Ansari's in Delhi has revealed the same thing everywhere: Pakistan's ISI had a big hand in the attack
 ansaari ke munh kholane ke baad ab bashir kaa ''sahitya'' puri librari kii shakl le chukaa he
 Their problem can be understood
 pakistan main naukarshahon ko isliye tankhwaah nahin milti ki ve iesai ko doshi tehraate phiren, agar aisa hua to vahaan saare mantriyon kii naukari turant chali jaaegi
 Either they have to deny it, or the case has to be given another turn
 inkaar to thik he, lekin maamle ko modana alag-alag dishaao main ho saktaa he
 For example, the case of Kashmir, which has been eroded after years of use
 aajkal ek nayaa bahaanaa chal padaa he, ''ham bhi aatankwaad ke shikaar hai
 "it appeals from above, but not deep into it
" yah tarika kandhe se dosha ko jhaad phenk kar bharat kaa bagalgir banane kii koshish he
 If Pakistan itself is a victim, then why is its government protecting Hafiz Saeed? Saudi Arabia has done what Pakistan has refused to do: take action against the identified 26 / 11 conspirators
 ansaari kii giraftaar bhartiya upmahadweep ke liye utani hi naatakeey or nirnaayak he jitani america ke liye osama bin laden kii maut thi
 Even after this episode, the government sitting in Islamabad is adopting its old stubborn attitude, but behind the scenes it must be feeling pain, because this latest chapter of 'literature' has been written in Riyadh
 sawaal uthta he ki saudi arab ne aise masale par bharat kaa sahyog karne kaa faisla kyon kiya jo bharat or pakistan ke rishton main talkhi kii buniyaad he?ansaari saudi arab main nakli pakistani passport par riyasat ali ke naam se gaya tha
 He was confident that Saudi Arabia was as safe as Pakistan because the ISI had a hand on its head
 ansaari ne bharat kii police ko jo baaten bataai hai, ve nishchit taur par saudi police ne bharat ko use saunpane se pehle hi ugalva lee hongi
 The Saudis knew that Ansari would name ISI officers like "major Iqbal" and "major Sameer Ali"
 saudi sarkaar jaanati thi ki ansaari ko bharat ke haathon saunpkar vah pakistan dwaara chalaae gaye behad khufia oparation ke chehre se aakhri nakaab bhi noch rahi he
 Saudi Arabia did this not just because Ansari is an enemy of India, but because he knows one thing that Pakistan will never accept: that Ansari is also an enemy of Saudi Arabia
 ansaari bharat se nafrat karata he yaa phir islam kii galat vyakhya kar ke majahabi kattarpanth ko failaata he, yah baat saudi kii janata yaa unke shaasha king abdulla ko nahin pachegi jo khud makka or madina kii do masjidon (harmen sharifen) ke sangrakshak hai
 If proof is needed, this is the proof that anti-india terrorism does not have the approval of the supreme Alambardars of Islam
 king abdulla kaa faisla turant aupchaarik kootneeti main to tabdeel nahin hoga, haalanki yah naatakeey tareeke se samrik dharanaon ko badalegaa or sataha ke neeche hulchalon main karavat paidaa karegaa
 Riyadh will continue to be a friend of Pakistan even further, but it has become an ally of Delhi in the war against terror

 - input IANS The CBI has summoned former Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar to appear on Saturday for questioning in connection with the Saradha chit fund scam
 adhikariyon ne shuukravaar ko yah jaankaree di
 The agency sent the summons by the Calcutta High Court on Friday after lifting the ban on their arrest
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki CBI adhikariyon kii team saman dene ke liye kumaar ke ghar pahunchi
 Kumar, currently working as Additional Director General of Police (CID), was part of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed by the state government to investigate the scam along with other chit fund cases
 haalanki ucchtam nyaayalay ne 2014 main is maamle ko CBI ko saunp diya tha
 The Saradha Group of Companies had allegedly defrauded lakhs of people by promising them a high return on investment of Rs 2,500 crore
 ullekhneey he ki ucch nyaayalay ne kumaar kii giraftaar par lagi roak hataane ke saath-saath unki us maang ko bhi asweekaar kar diya jisamen unhone CBI ke saman ko radd karne kii maang kii thi
 The Central Information Commission (CIC) has slammed the Public Information Officer of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) for providing false information on applications received under the Right to Information Act
 soochna ke adhikaar kanoon kaa anupaalan nahin karne par ayog ne janasuchana adhikari se poocha he ki kyon na uske khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai kii jaae or jurmaana lagaaya jaae
 Subhash Chandra Aggarwal, under the Right to Information, had sought information from the MCD regarding the cremation of crematoriums for allegedly sub-specific people at Nigambodh Ghat on the banks of river Yamuna, which has a grill around it
 
 agarwal kaa daawa he ki in shavadah chabutaron ke aasapaas gril isliye lagaai gai he taaki yahaan chuninda logon kaa shavadah sanskaar ho sake
 Dissatisfied with the response of the Public Information Officer and the First Appellate Authority, Agarwal turned to the CIC
 agarwal ne siaisi se is tathy par dhyaan dilaane kii koshish kii, ki yamuna nadi ke kinare sthit nigambodh ghat par shavadah sanskaar ko lekar bhedbhaavpurn ravaiya apanaaya ja rahaa he
 In this sequence, the CIC recognized that all people have the right to equality in a democracy and it is a matter of shame if such a practice is promoted by any public authority

 On the proposal made by the Muslim Personal Law Board to make Shariat courts in every district of the country, Minister of State for Law PP Chaudhary said that creating parallel system in the country is against the intention of the Constitution by Muslim Muslims Law Board in every district of the country
 On the proposal given to make the courts, Minister of State for Law PP Chaudhary says that it is a matter of compromise among themselves
 agar aisi shariat adaalaton par koi faisla aata he, phir isko lekar koi ek party raji nahin hoti to usko majaboor nahin kiya ja saktaa
 If both parties agree, then there will be no need for court
 unhone kaha ki agar mediation centre he to yah alag baat he
 When you talk about the court then you talk legally, such court decisions cannot be legally binding
 baadhyataa keval court ke dwaara hi ho saktaa he
 Will be valid only by the Constitution and which is a matter of making laws
 kisi bhi tarah kii adaalatein banane kii baat he to vah sansad or vidhansabhaon ke dwaara hi hota he
 Only the courts that are formed by them are considered
 peepi choudhary kaa kahana he ki bharat ke samvidhan main spasht taur se kaha gaya he ki koi bhi kanoon samvidhan ke mutabik hoga
 Apart from this, the law that is there will have no justification
 isi tarj par supreme court main teen talaak kaa mudda aayaa tha
 The Constitution of India gives equal protection to all
 isi tarj par supreme court ne mana tha ki teen talaak galat he, nyaay nahin anyaay he
 On the support of Sharia courts by some Muslim organizations, PP Chaudhary said, 'I speak legally and support should be legally valid
 jo hamaari adaalatein hai unka hi faisla maanya hoga
 Whether it is Hindu or Muslim or whoever it is, there is a constitution to solve every kind of matter within the country, everything should be according to its parameters
 iske alaava agar koi samanaantar system bananaa chaahate hai to vah samvidhan kii manshaa ke khilaaf he
 Courts cannot be created in this manner because these laws do not bind them
