 fanpagee) on Sep 17, 2018 at 9:23pm PDT Whether it is a religious ritual or recitation, any auspicious work or worship of the Gods, there is a tradition of tying a red thread ie Molly on the wrist of the hand in all auspicious works
 lekin kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki aakhir mauli yani kalava kyon baandhte hai? aakhir isaki vajah kya he? kalava yani raksha sutara baandhne ke vaigyanik or dharmik donon mahatv he
 The tying of the saksha sutra or mauli is part of the Vedic tradition
 yajna ke dauraan ise baandhe jane kii parampara to pehle se hi rahi he, lekin isko sankalp sutara ke saath hi raksha-sutara ke rup main baandhe jane kii vajah bhi he or puranic sambandh bhi
 Tripund gives blessings of 27 devas, know how to apply
 
 
 raksha sutara kaa mahatvaaisa mana jaataa he ki asuron ke daanveer raja bali kii amarta ke liye bhagwaan vaaman ne unki kalai par raksha-sutara baandha tha
 It is also considered a symbol of Rakshabandhan, Goddess Lakshmi tied this bond in the hands of King Bali to protect her husband
 mauli kaa arth'mauli' kaa shabdic arth he 'sabase upar'
 Molly also means head
 mauli ko kalai main baandhne ke kaaran ise kalava bhi kehete hai
 Its Vedic name is also sub-trib
 shankar bhagwaan ke sir par chandramaa virajman hai, isiilie unhen chandramauli bhi kaha jaataa he

 Moulimouli is made from raw thread
 isamen mulat: 3 rang ke dhaage hote hai- laal, pilaa or haraa, lekin kabhi-kabhi ye 5 dhaagon kii bhi banati he , jisamen nila or safed bhi hota he
 3 and 5 mean the name of Tridev, sometimes Panchdev
 kahaan-kahaan baandhte hai maulimauli ko haath kii kalai, gale or qamar main baandha jaataa he
 It is also tied in place of a deity for the vow
 mannath puri ho jane par ise khol diya jaataa he
 New items brought to Molly's house are also tied, it is also tied to animals
 jaaniye kyon kehete hai bhole ko nilakanthamauli baandhne ke niyam- purushon or avivaahit kanyaon ko daaen haath main kalava baandhna chahie
 - There is a rule for married women to tie Kalava in left hand
 - jis haath main kalava bandhawa rahe hon, uski mutthi bandhi honi chahie
 The other hand should be on the head
 - mauli kahin par bhi baandhen, ek baat kaa hameshaa dhyaan rahe ki is sutara ko keval 3 baar hi lapetna chahie
 Molly performs Rakshamauli when she is tied in the wrist, which is called kalava or sub maibandhi
 haath ke mul main 3 rekhaaen hoti hai jinako manibandh kehete hai
 The origin of destiny and lifeline is also the continent
 in manibandhon ke naam shiv, vishnu or brahma hai
 Similarly, Shakti, Lakshmi and Saraswati also live here
 jab kalava kaa mantra raksha hetu padhakar kalai main baandhte hai to ye teen dhaagon kaa sutara tridevon or trishaktiyon ko samarpit ho jaataa he, jisase raksha-sutara dhaaran karne vaale praani kii sab prakaar se raksha hoti he
 Sanjivani Booti Paharikya still exists here today, it is said in the scriptures that tying Mauli brings blessings of Trideva- Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh and all the three goddesses- Lakshmi, Parvati and Saraswati
 mauli kaa chikitsiya pakshaklai, pair, qamar or gale main mauli baandhne ke chikitsiya laabh bhi hai

 modi sarkaar ne teen talaak ko jurm ghoshit kar iske liye sajaa mukarrar karne sambandhi vidheyak loksabhaa main pesh kar diya he
 The name of the bill is 'the Muslim Women Protection of Rights in Marriage Act'
 ' khaas baat ye he ki mukhya vipakshi dal congress is vidheyak par centre sarkaar ke sur main sur mila rahi he
 Contrary to Muslim Muslim Law Board's expectation, Congress has decided to support the bill
 congress bill ko lekar kuch suzav to degi lekin usamen koi sanshodhan prastaav lekar nahin aegi
 Political information is surprised on this attitude of the Congress, but it is also being said that the newly elected President of the party Rahul Gandhi does not want to repeat the mistake of his father former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, due to which Congress has always been the target of right-wing politics and Muslim appeasement Due to this, there are allegations of taking the country backward
 congress kaa soft hindutv modelgauratlab he ki rahul gandhi ne haal hi main gujarat chunaav se nipatakar party kii kaman sanbhali he
 In the Gujarat assembly elections, the Congress caught the path of soft Hindutva
 chunavi nattejey congress ko apane is nae model ke safal hone kaa bharosa de rahe hai
 It is believed that the Rahul-led Congress will now implement this model in the country, whose first episode is the party's stand on the issue of triple talaq
 aise samay main jab lalu prasad yadav kii party argedy, naveen patnayak kii bijedy or asaduddin ovaisi ne khulkar teen talaak ke khilaaf kanoon banane ke modi sarkaar ke bill kaa virodh kar rahe hai, vahiin congress ne iskaa samarthan karne kaa faisla kiya he
 The party will also not introduce any amendment to the bill
 wo sirf ise lekar ek-do suzav sadan main rakhegi
 What is the case of Shahbano? Actually Congress does not want to repeat the mistake made by Rajiv Gandhi
 bataa den ki mohammad ahamed khan banaam shahbaano begum maamle main rajeev gandhi muslim kattarpathiyon ke saamne jhuk gaye the
 Shahbano was a Muslim woman from Indore, Madhya Pradesh
 unke pati ne jab unhen talaak diya tab unki umr 62varsh kii thi
 Shahabano, separated from her husband with her five children, did not have a source of income
 lihaaja unhone dand prakriya samhita (siarpisi) kii dhara 125 ke antargat apane pati se bharan poshan bhatte kii maang kii
 The court ruled in favor of Shah Bano
 lekin unke pati ne is faisle ke khilaaf apil kii or antat yah maamla sarvocch nyaayalay pahunchaa
 Supreme Court verdict in favor of Shahbano: The Supreme Court gave the verdict in his favor on 23 April 1985, accepting the argument of Shahbano
 is faisle ko muslim mahilaon ke adhikaar sunishchit karne ke kshetra main ek mile kaa pathar mana gaya or shahbaano kaa naam bharat ke nyaayik itihaas main hameshaa ke liye darj ho gaya
 But soon after this, politics started on this decision
 muslimon ke dabaav main rajeev gandhi ne palata faislamuslim personal lau board ne shahbaano ke paksh main aae nyaayalay ke faisle ke khilaaf andolan ched diya
 All the Muslim organizations of the country started opposing this decision
 unka kahana tha ki nyaayalay unke paariwarik or dharmik maamalon main hastkshep karke unke adhikaron kaa hanan kar rahaa he
 Protests began in different parts of the country
 centre kii satta main rajeev gandhi ke netritv vaali sarkaar thi
 The Rajiv Gandhi government passed the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 under pressure from Muslim religious leaders
 is adhinium ke jariye sarvocch nyaayalay ke faisle ko palat diya gaya
 Rajiv was on the target of Hinduist organizations, from BJP to the Sangh and Hinduist organizations have accused Rajiv Gandhi for minority appeasement and strongly condemned him
 bijepi ke netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi se lekar alke adwani, uma bharti sahit viechpi ashok singhl tak ke bhaashanon ke nishane par rajeev gandhi hote or muslim tushtikaran kaa tamgaa congress par lagaaya jaataa
 Till date Rajiv Gandhi and Congress are cursed by Hinduist organizations on this issue
 rajeev gandhi se juda rahul gandhi kii raahmaujuuda daur main congress kii kaman rahul gandhi ke haathon main he
 Rahul Gandhi is struggling to get the party out of Muslim appeasement
 gujarat chunaav ke dauraan rahul gandhi ne party ko is tamge se nikaalane ke liye soft hindutv kii raah pakadi
 Congress has benefited from this, party seats have increased in the state
 in sabake bich modi sarkaar ne teen talaak ko jurm ghoshit kar sajaa mukarrar karne sambandhi vidheyak loksabhaa main pesh kar diya to congress bhi uski haa main haa mila rahi he
 It is clear that in view of the Muslim views, the steps adopted by Rajiv Gandhi in 1986, now Rahul Gandhi does not want to repeat that mistake

 'india won the match by 243 runs
 yadi yah aadhikarik match hota to yah australia ke liye ekadivasiy match main sabase badi paraajay hoti
 The victory was mainly attributed to three players

 Rakesh gave Rs 20 lakh as an earnest money to Sanjay
 sabhi paise 1000-500 rupee kii karansi main the
 But later it turned out that this property is disputed, so Rakesh wanted to cancel the deal
 is bich notebandi ke elaan ho gaya
 Sanjay wanted to return that amount in real time
 rakesh ne daleel thi ki use nai karansi main paise waapas chahie
 There was a dispute between them about this matter
 
 Rakesh could not bear his loss
 usne sanjay ko raste se hataane kii sajeesh rach daali
 Rakesh, the mastermind of this conspiracy, has many charges of murder and is still in jail
 rakesh ne jail se hi apane bete ko contact kiya or kanwal rana naam ke badmaash ke saath milakar sanjay kaa kaam tamaam karne kaa plan bana daalaa
 Sanjay is the handicap

 On this, Aaj Tak correspondent Gopi Ghanghar spoke to UP BJP co-incharge Gordhan Zadaphia
 agsit pole main bijepi ko upi main badi jeet milane kaa anumaan he
 On this, Gordhan Zadaphia said that whatever happens, BJP is sure to get 65 seats out of 80
 unhone kaha ki bijepi kii 65 se kam siten to ho hi nahin saktin
 On the SP-BSP pair, he said that three months ago it seemed that this pair could prove to be successful, but due to the internal fight between the workers of both parties, the SP-BSP pair has not proved to be effective
 vahiin, jhadfia ne ye bhi kaha ki sapa- basapa ne saath main 10 se zyada raily bhi nahin kii
 Stating the reason for the bjp's victory, Zadaphia said that people had hope from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, which is seen changing in confidence in 2019
 unhone aage kaha ki yogiji or modiji donon ke netritv main upi main kai parivartan hue hai
 There has been development in Yogi ji's 2-year term
 vahiin, modi ji ke paanch saal ke kaarykaal main ham gaanv-gaanv tak vikaas pahunchaa paae hai
 Zadaphia counted the merits of PM Modi and said that under the scheme, giving money directly to the bank account to the farmers, taking crops at the lowest price, all these things have proved very effective
 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi par jhadfia ne kaha ki ye pehali baar nahin tha ki priyanka gandhi yahaan par campaning kar rahi thim, lekin unki campaning logon ke dilon tak nahin pahunch pai

 Although the cleanliness of the ghats of Kashi was done in the wave of 'swachh Bharat Abhiyan', but the Ganga's dirt has not been removed yet

 In the last five years, more than three students have been awarded Diploma of Engineering in Kawardha Polytechnic College
 yah bade aashcharya kii baat he ki bina practical ke hi teen sau chaatro kii ejineering kii padhai puri ho gai
 There are also reports of two classes being conducted for students studying engineering with a polythene curtain in the middle of a small hall

 In this regard, it is said that there is lack of sufficient space to make students practical
 chaatro ko mashin ko dur se dikhaakar hi ejineering kii padhai puri kii ja rahi he
 Principal in charge of Kawardha Polytechnic College, Dr
 es
 K
 singh ne kaha, 'mashin chalaakar nahin dikhaaya jaataa he, kyonki yahaan mashin chalaane ke liye paryaapt jagah nahin he
 There is no class room for practicals
 mashine hai, jinhen dikhaakar hi chaatro ko samajhaayaa jaataa he
 'polytechnic has been taught for five sessions from 2010 to 2014

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke badalte rujhaanon ke bich congress abhi himmat nahin haari he
 Congress seems to be the second largest party in the trends after BJP
 bijepi bahumat se thodaa peeche rahati dikh rahi he or congress karnataka main kam se kam ek baar sarkaar banane kii koshish karnaa chaahati he
 Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is present in Karnataka, told reporters that he had a phone conversation with both Deve Gowda and his son Kumaraswamy
 unhone bataaya ki jedies ne is prastaav ko sweekaar kiya he
 Azad said that the JDS government will run
 unhone aage kaha ki shaam ko governor se milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya jayega
 He said that the Governor will be told that we have more seats than BJP
 isse pehle, mangalvaar dopaher ko sonia gandhi ne karnataka main maujuud congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ko phone karke kaha ki vah jedies pramukh echdi devgauda se baat karen
 The Congress and the JDS are in the form of forming a government together, but if the BJP comes to be the largest party, then it can get the first invitation to form the government and prove its majority
 jaankaree ke mutabik upie kii cheirperson sonia gandhi ne gulam nabi aaazaad se kaha he ki vah turant siddharmaiya se baat karen
 Congress may propose to make Deve Gowda's son Kumaraswamy as CM
 haalanki, congress or jedies ke bich main baatcheet devgauda ke bete kumaraswami kii vajah se fail ho sakati he
 However, BJP has not yet received a green signal from JDS
 vaise kaha ja rahaa rahaa he ki agar bijepi bhi sarkaar banane ke aankade se peeche rah jaati he to kumaraswami congress ke bajaae bijepi ke saath ja sakate hai
 The reason for this is the BJP ruling at the Center
 bijepi ke akele bahumat hasil na kar paane kii surat main dekhnaa hoga ki jedies kii baatcheet kiske saath patari par baithti he
 Realizing this situation, the Congress had already sent Ghulam Nabi Azad and Ashok Gehlot to Karnataka a day before the counting of votes
 haalanki,congress ke liye karnataka main sarkaar bananaa itnaa aasaan nahinhoga, kyonki bijepi itani aasaani se dakshin bharat main apni vaapasi kaa mauka haath se jane nahin degi
 The Congress has lost the opportunity to form governments in Goa and Meghalaya even earlier than BJP
 goa main 40 vidhansabha siton ke liye 2017 main hue chunaavon main congress ne 17 siten jiti thim or bijepi ke paas 13 siten thim, lekin bijepi yahaan par duusare dalon ke samarthan se sarkaar banane main safal rahi

 ) With the support of the government

 US President Barack Obama's three-day visit to India began here today with deals worth $ 10 billion between companies from both countries in energy, aviation and other sectors that will generate more than 50,000 job opportunities in the US

 With the goal of doubling exports from the US to India in five years, Obama said that this would increase employment opportunities in both countries
 unhone kaha, ‘bharat vartmaan main america ke saath vyapaar karne vaale deshon main 12wein sthaan par he, yah pehle sthaan par kyon nahin aa saktaa
 'obama has come to India at a time when the unemployment level in America is high and the pace of improvement in the condition of the US economy has been slow due to the recent recession
 in samasyaon ke bich america sansad ke madhyavadhi chunaav main unki demacretic party ko haar kaa saamana dekhnaa padaa he
 Obama insisted on opening India's market for American companies as soon as he arrived here
 unhone kaha ki america companiyaan bharat main zyada nivesh karnaa chaahati hai
 Obama said that many important deals had been agreed between the companies of many countries even before he set foot on Indian soil
 obama ne kaha ki 10 arab dollars (44,000 crores rupee) ke 20 se adhik saudon main bowing company darjanon vimaan bechegi, jabaki jeei 100 se adhik electric ingine bechegi
 These deals were confirmed before they arrived

 India is investing heavily in its infrastructure sector and transparency is being taken for economic growth and entrepreneurship
 ’’ america bharat vyavsaayik parishad (yuasaibisi) kii baithak ko sambodhit karte huye kaha ‘‘krishi se lekar dhanchaagat kshetra main, khudara se lekar doorsanchaar kshetra main nivesh or vyapaar pratibandhon main kuch kami laai jaani chaiye
 Growth and employment in the new global economy are drawn towards those countries where restrictions on trade and investment are less
 ’bharat main america nivesh badhaane ke prati patibaddhta vyakt karte huye obama ne kaha agle paanch saal main america kaa bharat ko niryaat duguna hone kii sambhaavnaayen maujuud hai or yah sthiti donon deshon ke bich phaayde kii hogi

 Obama said that the bilateral economic ties could be strengthened by the steps taken by both countries
 unhone kaha, samjhaute jo janata tathaa hamaare bhavishya ke liye athulaneey vaadon se bhare hai
 Promises of new employment, industry and new development

 america raashtrapati ne kaha,koi vajah nahin he ki bharat hamaara sheersh (philhal 12wein sthaan par) vyapaar bhagidaar nahin ban sake 
 i am confident that the relationship between India and America is going to be an important partnership of the 21st century
 is avasar par obama ne bharat ko bhavishya ke us bazaar ke rup main nirupit kiya jahaan america nivesh karnaa chahta he lekin yah sab tatakar tathaa anya baadhaon ko dur karne par nirbhar karegaa
 The relaxation of export regulations may be in the form of cessation of technology restrictions against Indian institutions such as DRDO and ISRO
 bharat-america vyapaar 2009-10 main 36
 5 billion dollars
 agle paanch saal main america kaa bharat ko niryaat duguna karne kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya he
 Obama said that just as Americans had helped India during the green revolution in agriculture, in the same way Indians have also helped build America
 bazaar ko kholane tathaa license raaj kii samaapti kii ore sanket karte hue unhone kaha, aaj, aapkaa desh duniya main sabase teji se badhati arthvyavasthaaon main se ek he
 And the pace at which this country has progressed in the last two decades is an achievement
 unhone kaha,duniya kaa sabase bada madhyam varg aapke yahaan he
 India's growing growth could make it one of the largest economies in the world
 obama ne kaha ki unhen isamen koi andeh nahin he ki donon desh vyapaar main or acha kar sakate he

 Advocate Nehal Ansari and his lecturer wife Fauzia are waiting for help from the Pakistan court as he has spent more time in jail and is still lodged in Peshawar Central Jail

 The family approached the Human Rights Commission in Pakistan with the help of some people and filed a Habeas Corpus in court on 1 April 2014
 lekin iske baad unhen jo khabar mili, usne unhen hilaa kar rakh diya
 Fauzia said, 'zeenat had gone to a joint meeting of all senior officials of Pakistan and told that she had been threatened to stay away from the case but she did not listen to them and still went for the next meeting
 jab wo waapas aa rahi thi, us dauraan uskaa apharan ho gaya or tab se uskaa kuch pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 Then the new Asafoujia of Jagi help is unable to understand how to help Zeenat's family now? He had no choice but to pray for Hamid as well as Zeenat
 iske baad unhone ek pratishthit vakil kaaji anwar se sampark kiya or unki madad se unhen ek ahm jaankaree haath lagi
 On 15 January this year, the Government of Pakistan had admitted that Hamid was in the custody of Military Intelligence and that the trial was going on in connection with that charge
 iske baad hamid ko 3 saal kaid kii sajaa sunai gai lekin wo trial ke dauraan hi issejyada samay jail main kaat chukaa he

 The case was heard on May 4, but nothing has been done yet
 hamid ke mata-pita ke vakil usase milane jail main gaye lekin waapas aakar unhone bataaya ki wo unke bete jaisaa nahin dikhataa
 Hearing about the mother, Hamidfouzia cried, "I told him to put his hands on his head and tell me about him
" unhone bataaya ki unhone aisa kiya or apni maa ke bare main sunne ke baad wo bahut royaa
 He wore eye glasses but the lawyers said that he did not have glasses
 maine sochaa ki phir wo dekh kaise paata hoga
 i told him the power of his glasses and at the next meeting they gave him glasses
 'bas ab bete ke waapas aane kaa intjarphjia pakistan media ke jariye apane bete ke bare main bhi padhati rahati hai
 Through the media he came to know that Hamid has been beaten up in jail and he is ill
 phojia or unke pati ab sirf apane bete ke waapas aane kaa intjaar kar rahe hai taaki wo use hameshaa apane kareeb rakh saken or kabhi usne khud se dur na jane den

 The Chief Minister did not even discuss at that time
 yadi siem samay rahete koi kadam uthaate to maharashtra nahin jalataa or naa hi kakasaheb scindia kii mrityu hoti
 The Shiv Sena mouthpiece also mentions that the Maratha movement was first going on peacefully throughout Maharashtra, but the Fadnavis government did the work of pouring fuel into the fire of this movement
 sarkaar ne 70 hajaar sarkari bhartee nikaali or maratha samudaay ke naukariyon main aarakshan kii maang ko nazarandaaj kar diya
 The talk of not getting a job due to reservation gave rise to a fear among the youth of the Maratha community and people took to the streets and incited violence
 saamana main maratha aarakshan andolan ko lekar baaki partiyon ko ek saath aane kii bhi baat kahi gai he
 It has been written that Maratha community is important for Maharashtra and all parties come together to resolve the issue of reservation
 bijepi main mukhyamantri badalane kii baat
 
 
 Amidst the agitation for Maratha reservation, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that there is talk of replacing Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis within the BJP

 punjab netaa vipaksh ech es phulka ne kaha kii durgesh pathak or sanjay singh kaa istipha pehle hi ho janaa chahie tha
 But the MCD did not happen due to the election and we welcome his resignation
 phulka ne kaha ki chunaav main kain tarah kii galtiyaan unki party se hui, jinhen khud kejariwal bhi maanate hai
 That is why Kejriwal has said that he wants to start afresh

 pradhanmantri narendra modi kashmir ke halaat par sarvadaleey baithak main hissaa lenge
 In the Rajya Sabha, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that a meeting of all the parties is being called on the afternoon of 12 August
 vipaksh ne pradhanmantri par aarope lagaaya tha ki sadan main kashmir par kai baar charchaa ho chuki lekin pradhanmantri ne bayaan nahin diya magar madhya pradesh ke jhabua main jaakar bayaan diya
 Ghulam Nabi Azad of Congress questioned whether Jhabua shifted from Parliament and capital Delhi
 is par grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki maine kashmir par har baar bayaan diye hai
 My statement is not a statement alone
 main jo bhi bolta hum usamen pradhanmantri kii bhi bhaavana hoti he kyonki kashmir ke masale par ham lagaataar baatcheet karte rahete hai
 The situation in Kashmir was discussed very openly in the Rajya Sabha
 sarkaar ne bhi sabko suna or vipaksh ne bhi khub sunaaya, baad main sarkaar ne bhi sunaaya
 But all this was not happening in an atmosphere of discord, but in an atmosphere of dialogue
 sansad ne ekamat se prastaav paas kiya gaya ki sadan kashmir ke halaat par chintit he
 There can be no compromise with national security, on the other hand, immediate steps should be taken to restore peace
 ye prastaav paas hua he
 Rajnath Singh presented a figure of supply of milk, sugar, fruits, vegetables, and fought against the attitude which was still dominated by the wounded face of the pellet guns
 rajnath singh ne kaha, ''95% foodgrain ke distribution kaa kaam hua he, 34000 quintal chini kaa distribution hua he, 3 lakh 10 hazaar alpiji gas silinderon kii bikri hui he
 The sale of fruit vegetables in the valley is also being done by relaxing the curfew
 subah hone se pehle doodh kaa vitaran bhi ho rahaa he
 From July 14 to today, 5600 trucks have arrived in the valley carrying essential commodities
 yahi nahin, paanch lakh marizon kaa opidi main ilaaj kiya gaya he, 8 hazaar choti badi surgery kii gai he
 '' grahamantri rajnath singh ne 5600 trek kii sankhya to bataa di lekin maujuuda tanaav se pehle ghati main pahunchane vaale trakon kii sankhya kitni hua karti thi
 That is, the strategic and diplomatic complexity in Kashmir's debates becomes so dominant that people like us get nervous
 meri raay main grih mantri rajnath singh ne parchun se lekar petrol tak kii list banaakar vipaksh ke haahaakaari bhav ko maat di he
 For the first time it was felt that the supply of essential commodities can assure us about the seriousness of the Kashmir problem that as long as the supply is right, there is no need to beat the chest
 grahamantri rajnath singh kisi sawaal se peeche nahin hate
 He said that a committee has been formed for the option of pellet guns which will give opinion in two months
 magar pehle bhi suraksha balon ko iske istemaal na karne ke nirdesh diye gaye the

 Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav had asked the government that Pakistan keeps doing Kashmir, why don't we keep doing Pak Occupied Kashmir
 grahamantri ne kaha ki kashmir par pakistan se koi baat nahin hogi
 Now whenever there will be talk, there will be talk on Pak Occupied Kashmir

 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti met the Home Minister on Tuesday
 unhone kaha tha ki jaise vaajapeyi ke samay main baatcheet kaa daur chalaa tha, apnaapan badhaane kaa, mujhe lagata he ki phir se vaisaa hi karne kii zarurat he
 We need to heal people's wounds
 baatcheet kii zarurat he
 Jammu and Kashmir can act as a bridge between India and Pakistan if negotiations are initiated properly
 ye mahabuuba kaa kahana tha
 The situation in Kashmir was discussed very openly in the Rajya Sabha
 sarkaar ne bhi sabko suna or vipaksh ne bhi khub sunaaya, baad main sarkaar ne bhi sunaaya
 But all this was not happening in an atmosphere of discord, but in an atmosphere of dialogue
 sansad ne ekamat se prastaav paas kiya gaya ki sadan kashmir ke halaat par chintit he
 There can be no compromise with national security, on the other hand, immediate steps should be taken to restore peace
 ye prastaav paas hua he
 Rajnath Singh presented a figure of supply of milk, sugar, fruits, vegetables, and fought against the attitude which was still dominated by the wounded face of the pellet guns
 rajnath singh ne kaha, ''95% foodgrain ke distribution kaa kaam hua he, 34000 quintal chini kaa distribution hua he, 3 lakh 10 hazaar alpiji gas silinderon kii bikri hui he
 The sale of fruit vegetables in the valley is also being done by relaxing the curfew
 subah hone se pehle doodh kaa vitaran bhi ho rahaa he
 From July 14 to today, 5600 trucks have arrived in the valley carrying essential commodities
 yahi nahin, paanch lakh marizon kaa opidi main ilaaj kiya gaya he, 8 hazaar choti badi surgery kii gai he
 '' grahamantri rajnath singh ne 5600 trek kii sankhya to bataa di lekin maujuuda tanaav se pehle ghati main pahunchane vaale trakon kii sankhya kitni hua karti thi
 That is, the strategic and diplomatic complexity in Kashmir's debates becomes so dominant that people like us get nervous
 meri raay main grih mantri rajnath singh ne parchun se lekar petrol tak kii list banaakar vipaksh ke haahaakaari bhav ko maat di he
 For the first time it was felt that the supply of essential commodities can assure us about the seriousness of the Kashmir problem that as long as the supply is right, there is no need to beat the chest
 grahamantri rajnath singh kisi sawaal se peeche nahin hate
 He said that a committee has been formed for the option of pellet guns which will give opinion in two months
 magar pehle bhi suraksha balon ko iske istemaal na karne ke nirdesh diye gaye the
 This is the reason that the number of security forces among the injured is more than the civilians
 4515 suraksha bal ghayal hue hai or 3356 naagarik ghayal hue hai

 Rajnath Singh said, "95% of foodgrain distribution has been done, 34000 quintals of sugar has been distributed, 3 lakh 10 thousand LPG gas cylinders have been sold
 ghati main fal sabzi kii bhi kareed bikri karfue main dheel dekar kii ja rahi he
 Milk is also being distributed before dawn
 14 july se lekar aaj tak aavashyak vastuon ko lekar 5600 trek ghati main pahunch chuke hai
 Not only this, five lakh patients have been treated in OPD, 8 thousand small major surgeries have been done
 '' Home Minister Rajnath Singh gave the number of 5600 trucks, but before the current tension, what was the number of trucks that reached the valley
 yani ve, kashmir kii bahason main ranneetik or kootnithik jatilta itani haaavee ho jaati he ki ham jaise log ghabara jate hai
 In my opinion, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has defeated the hawkish sense of opposition by making a list ranging from groceries to petrol
 pehali baar laga ki zaruri chizon kii aapurti kii jaankaree hamen kashmir samasya kii gambhirtha ko lekar aashwast kar sakati he ki jab tak supplai thik he tab tak bahut chaati peetane kii zarurat nahin he
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh did not back down from any questions
 unhone kaha ki pallate gan ke vikalp ke liye ek cameti bana di gai he jo do maheenon main raay degi
 But earlier, security forces were instructed not to use it
 yahi kaaran he ki ghayalon main suraksha balon kii sankhya nagarikon se zyada he
 4515 security forces were injured and 3356 civilians were injured
 ye aankada suraksha balon ke sanyam kaa gavaah he
 The comments vipaksh ke saansad kashmir kashmir kar rahe the, bijepi ke saansad or grahamantri ne jammu kashmir or ladakh par khaas taur se jor diya
 Perhaps there is a beautiful and new strategic understanding behind presenting this problem in the context of the geographical vastness of the area
 kai dinon se whatsap par bhi is tarah ke kuch massej chal rahe the ki ladakh or jammu ko shaamil kar len to is vakt jo prabhavit ilaaka he wo kaaphi kam he
 Social media takes itself very seriously, but the Home Minister also said that he does not take the issues of social media about Kashmir very seriously
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa ramgopal yadav ne sarkaar se poocha tha ki pakistan kashmir kashmir karata rahata he, ham kyon nahin paak adhikrut kashmir karte rahete hai
 The Home Minister said that there would be no talk with Pakistan on Kashmir
 ab jab bhi baat hogi paak adhikrut kashmir par baat hogi
 Only scholars who write thick books in Kashmir can tell that there has been a big change in the policy of the government or it has been said
 kaha jaataa rahaa he to aapane kab suna he
 Discussion on Kashmir is being discussed
 maujuuda samasya ke sandarbh main kaha gaya ki charchaa nahin ho rahi he
 What has been achieved of this discussion
 jammu or kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne mangalvaar ko grahamantri se mulaakaat kii thi
 He had said that as Vajpayee's time had gone through a conversation, to increase familiarity, i think that needs to be done again

 Chinese President Xi Jinping reached Ahmedabad and was very warmly welcomed by PM Modi
 a Preity Banquet is also organized near the Sabarmati Ashram in his honor
 china ke raashtrapati se bharat ko bahut ummiden hai
 Expect more energy in the relationship between the two countries than ever before, but new gates are also being speculated to open
 china asia kii sabase badi shakti he or bharat se uske hajaaron saal ke rishte rahe hai
 Trade between the two countries has increased considerably in recent years, but China has benefited many times over
 ab bharat-china vyapaar badhkar 85 arab dollar tak ja pahunchaa he
 Now the Chinese Prime Minister wants to start a new chapter by investing 100 billion dollars directly in India
 china bharat ko apane bane-banaae saamaane bechney ke alaava ab yahaan kii badi-badi infrastracchar pariyojnaon main paise lagaana chahta he
 He wants to invest $ 7 billion in industrial parks in India
 yahaan kii rail pariyojnaon main vah 50 arab dollar se bhi adhik dhan lagaakar unhen world class bana dene kii ichha rakhata he
 He wants to invest huge amount in the roads, ports and rivers here
 china ne pehle hi jataa diya he ki bharat kii bullate train pariyojna main uski bahut zyada ruchi he or vah do rooton par bullate train pariyojna main bhagidaari kaa icchhuk he
 Not only this, he is willing to take any steps to enhance the economic relations between the two countries
 narendra modi ke china se puraane rishte rahe hai or vah china ko acchhee tarah samajhate hai isliye unke liye baatcheet ko tarkit parinti tak le jane main koi pareshaani nahin hogi
 China has the largest foreign exchange reserves in the world
 vah un chuninda deshon main he jinka niryaat aayaat se kahin zyada he
 So it is not difficult for him to invest on a large scale here
 samyawad se poonjeevaad tak kaa jo safar china ne tay kiya he vah kaabile tarif he
 It has left most countries of the world behind in money, progress and technology

 He is obviously taking this trip to India seriously
 vah jaanate hai ki badale hue halaat main bharat unke liye ek badhiya bhagidaar sabit ho saktaa he
 This is a good opportunity for India to allow China to invest on a large scale here
 piem modi is tathy se avgat hai or isliye unhone kai kadam uthaae hai
 But those who know China also know that although india-china relations are historical but the boundary dispute between them is very old and deep, both of which have fought a big battle
 china bharat ke purvottar ke kai bhaagon ko apana bataata he, khaas tak arunachal pradesh ko
 There has been a lot of bitterness on this issue and China gives visas to people there on a separate paper called stapled visa
 matlab yah he ki donon ke bich seemaa vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye bade kadam uthaane kaa bhi yah behtareen avasar he, haalanki china ke rukh main abhi koi badlaav nahin dikhataa
 But if both the trade treaties were done on a large scale then the time is not far that the border dispute will be reduced and some way will be found because China is also a clever businessman
 vah jaanata he ki bahut bade munaafe ke liye choti-moti baton se kinaaraa kiya ja saktaa he

 The ongoing charge-and-counter game between Tata Sons and Cyrus Mistry is not taking its name to a standstill
 sirus mistre ne ab daawa kiya he ki tata sans ke nideshak vijay singh ne agasta westland ghotaale main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 Vijay Singh was a member of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of Tata Sons, which reviewed Mistry's performance on June 28, 2016
 mistre ne kaha ki madhya pradesh ke mukhya sachiv or kendriya raksha sachiv ke rup main vijay singh kaa koi khaas yogadan nahin tha
 Mistry has alleged that he is devising various theories to justify his role in Ratan Tata's conspiracy to expel him from the post of chairman of the company
 mistre ke aaropon ko nakaarte hue bhootpurv raksha sachiv vijay singh ne kaha ki agasta westland saude ko unki sevanivritti ke baad mantrimandal ne manjuuri di
 Linking me to the agustawestland scandal is false and malicious
 ghotaale main hui inaki giraftaarupie shasankaal main hue 3600 karod rupee ke agasta helicopter deal main kathith ghoosekhori ke maamle main purv vaayu sena pramukh es pi tyaagi samet sanjeev tyaagi or vakil gautam khetaan ko sibiai ne haal hi main giraftaar kiya tha
 Sanjeev Tyagi, a relative of SP Tyagi, and lawyer Gautam Khaitan have also been arrested in this case involving bribery of Rs 450 crore in the purchase of 12 VVIP helicopters
 tata ke mistre par aaropaisse pehle tata sans ne sirus mistre par nayaa aarope lagaate hue kaha he ki ratan tata kii jagah nae chairman ke chayan ke liye 2011 main gathit chayan samiti ko unhone gumraah kiya tha
 Mistry made big statements on the plans for the Tata group, but did not give an effective management framework and plan as promised
 tata sans kii ore se die gaye bayaan main kaha gaya ki mistre ne vaade ke anuroop paariwarik upkram shaporji pallonji se duuri nahin banaai
 Mistri's commitment to his ability to lead the Tata group remained untouched by personal interests only because of his turn
 bayaan main kaha gaya ki labhaansh aay (tisies ko chhodkar) main lagaataar giravat ai
 Staff costs more than doubled during Mistry's tenure

 india today conklev main anna hajaare ne kaha, jabatak saamaajik parivartan nahin aayega tab tak badlaav nahin hoga
 He said that corruption is a tyrant in the country and that along with the elimination of corruption in development, development is also very important
 unhone kaha, 'main yahaan koi gyaan kii baat bataane nahin aayaa bas apana anubhav aapke saath baantoonga
 Gandhiji had said to go to the village
 jabatak swalambi gaanv nahin khadey honge tab tak desh tarakkee nahin hoga

 The public is the owner and not the leader
 lokapal kii charchaa karte hue anna ne kaha ki agar lokapal aa gaya to sarkaar or baaki partiyon ke aadhe se zyada log jail main honge

 Every day advanced mobile technology has revolutionized the world of smart phones
 har din nae nae feechar vaale smart phone bazaaro main laanch kiye ja rahe hai
 People are competing to buy the best smart phones
 isaki sabase badi vajah smart phone main hai quality camere kaa hona he
 These days selfie craze is increasing in people due to front and back cameras in smart phones
 mobile ke front camere se khud kii tasviir nikalnaa itnaa aasaan ho gaya he ki log pehle jaise photo clic karne ke liye dusron kaa sahaara nahin lete
 They themselves prefer to take their pictures from the front camera of their expensive smartphone which is called selfie
 in dinon yuvaaon main selfi lene kaa crez is kadar bad gaya he ki public gadering ho yaa koi privet okeshan har koi ek duusare ke saath selfi lete nazar aata he
 The increasing craze of people towards selfies has given rise to many mental and physical illnesses, in which 'selfie Elbow' is the most unique and new edition
 kya he selfi albo'tennis albo' or ' golf albo' kaa naam to apane pehle suna hi hoga par ab 'selfi albo' ke liye bhi taiyaar ho jaaie
 In order to take selfie from our mobile again and again, we forget that our hands and especially elbows are stressed
 or agar ham selfi lene kaa silsilaa lambey samay tak jari rakhte he to kuch samay baad hamaari kohni main dard shuru ho jaataa he jise selfi albo kaa naam diya gaya he
 In fact, to take a selfie, we have to raise our hand by holding a mobile or selfie stick, which causes our elbow to bend automatically and being in the same position for a long time causes a sprain or stretch in our elbow muscle
 
 or ye khinchaav dhire dhire masal injuri main tabdeel ho jaataa he
 Due to which there is constant pain in the elbow, along with pain, swelling also occurs and after the reduction of swelling, it becomes scar or scar
 selfi albo ke baad hamaare kohni ke masal kii flexibility dhire dhire kam hone lagati he or aksar log is par zyada dhyaan nahi dete or selfi lene kaa silsilaa jari rakhte he jiske chalate ye gambhir rup akhtiyaar kar leti he or hamaari kohni ke har movement par dard badhata hi jaataa he
 Which later causes elbow injury, in which our hand movements stop decreasing
 samay rahete doctorl madad nahin lee to ye samasya taumr aapako sata sakati he
 Such cases have not come to light in India, but one of the reasons may be lack of awareness among people
 zyaadaatar logon ko pataa hi nahin chalata ki unke haath main hone vaale dard kaa conection unki selfi kii lat ke chalate bhi ho saktaa he
 Dr
 Sameer Malhotra, director of Mental Health and Behavior Signs of self-sufficiency illnessmax Super Specialty Hospital, says, "it's a way of taking selfies, taking selfies repeatedly, posing in different positions, active on social networks but one's own family and Social Disconnect with Relatives This is a method of self-obsessive disorder called "self-healing"
 ye ek tareeke kaa mental ilnes he jisame vyakti khud main itnaa kho jaataa he ki use ghar parivaar kii sud nahi hoti
 Such a person or youth suffers from a lack of feeling in themselves
 or ek kaalpanik duniya me kho jate he jahaan unki filter kii gai selfies ko hazaaron likes milte he"
 People suffering from self-injury are the victims of obsessive complusion disorder
 or unka sara samay sirf khud ko nihaarne or selfi or use apadet yaa aplod karne main biit jaataa he
 Symptoms- Self-sufferers or youths will be seen taking selfies from mobile phones several times a day - Such youth are busy capturing every opportunity in their phones - Such youth have more friends in social media than real friends - Social media i spend more time online uploading photos and hungry for others' likes and appreciation - the family relationship of such youth is affected Is, and their social life is negligible - anxiety, anger, irritable pun, being angry with you all the time and insisting on being alone is the most important symptom
 Taking selfies frequently can cause many more problems, This includes the facial skin being dry with more exposure of the mobile flash light and wrinkles on the face before time

 The Election Commission has confirmed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has received the highest amount of donations of 210 million rupees in 2017-18 from electoral bonds
 baaki saare dal milakar bhi is bond se sirf 11 karod rupee kaa chanda hasil kar paae the
 The Election Commission informed the Supreme Court on Thursday in the ongoing hearing in this case and confirmed the figures

 The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has challenged the electoral bond system in the Supreme Court
 elactoral bond abhi sirf bhartiya state bank (SBI) se hi kharide ja sakate hai
 According to the reply received by ADR under Right to Information (RTI), there has been a 62% jump in sales of electoral bonds in the last one year
 times of india ke mutabik, saal 2016-17 main bijepi ko kul 997 karod or saal 2017-18 main kul 990 karod rupee kaa chanda hasil hua tha
 This is about five times of the donations received by the Congress in the same period

 koi bhi donor apni pahchaan chhupate hue state bank of india se ek karod rupye tak mulya ke elactoral bonds kharid kar apni pasand ke raajnneetik dalon ke bank khaaton main jamaa kar sakate hai
 This system does not open the identity of donors and is also exempt from tax
 chunaav ayog ne bhi apni tippaniyon main elactoral bond jaisi agyaat banking vyavastha ke jariye raajnneetik funding ko lekar andeh jaahir kiye hai
 But the central government introduced this bond with the claim that it would increase transparency in political funding and bring in clean money
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne janvari 2018 main likhaa tha, 'elactoral bond kii yojana raajnneetik funding kii vyavastha main 'saaf-suthra' dhan laane or 'paardarshita' badhaane ke liye laai gai he

 desh kii raajnneeti main kshetreey dalon ke liye yun to 2014 se hi khatre kii ghanti bajane lagi thi, magar 2019 main or bade bahumat se satta main aakar bijepi ne in dalon kii qamar hi tod di
 The regional parties, which once proved to be king makers for the central governments, now face an existential crisis
 ye dal siton ke mohataaj ho chuke hai
 In UP, parties with solid vote banks like SP and BSP have also lost their support base
 ab jammu-kashmir main lagu anuchhed 370 ko dhwast kar bijepi ne kshetreey dalon par ek or prahaar kar diya he
 It is believed that this strike is going to prove fatal for the regional parties
 isse aane vaale chunaavon main rashtrawaad kii lahar or tej chalegi
 Which will not be easy for these regional parties to face
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 7 rashtriya dalon ko 376 siten milin thim, magar 2019 main kul 542 siton par hue loksabhaa chunaav main ye dal 397 siten jeetne main safal rahe
 Thus, within five years, 21 Lok Sabha seats of regional parties were reduced
 sirf loksabhaa chunaav hi nahin, vidhansabha chunaav main bhi kshetreey dalon kii jameen khisak gai he
 If we talk about their existence, only in major states like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, West Bengal, regional parties are in power on their own
 nagaland or sikkim main kshetreey dalon kii sarkaar jarur he, magar yahaan bhi endie ke sahyog se chal rahi he
 At the same time, Congress has government in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Rajasthan and BJP in other states
 samaajawaadee party ke kabje se sabase bade soobe uttar pradesh ko bijepi 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main chin chuki he
 How did the regional parties in the region Only regional parties like Shiromani Akali Dal and Jammu and Kashmir National Conference were formed before independence
 anya kshetreey dal congress ke kamjor hone ke baad se astitv main aae
 Political analysts point out that the roots of the Congress, which had been in power since independence in the country, began to weaken in 1967
 jiske baad kshetreey, bhashaai asmita yaa sthaneey muddon ke aadhaar par kshetreey dal ubharne lage
 With the weakening of Congress, national issues also began to weaken in elections
 jisane chunaavon main kshetreey dalon ke ubhaar main madad kii
 Most of the regional parties in the country have stood by the political ground of the Congress
 philhal, desh main bijepi, congress, basapa, rakanpa, sipiai (em), bhakpa, tiemasi rashtriya party hai
 There are 35 recognized parties in the states
 vahiin kshetreey dalon kii sankhya kareeb 329 he
 Now national issues will resonate in the assembly elections, political analyst Ratan Mani Lal aajtak
 in se kehete hai ki desh kii raajnneeti bade badlaav se guzar rahi he
 Since the withdrawal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, the manner in which the atmosphere has been created in the country, national unity has become a big debate, it seems that the upcoming assembly elections will be fought not on the local issues of the states but on national issues
 jharkhand, haryana, maharashtra or dilli ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon main isaki jhalak dikhegi
 BJP will make Kashmir a big issue
 chunki kshetreey dalon kaa astitv hi sthaneey muddon kii raajnneeti par nirbhar hota he
 In such a situation, when national issues will become an issue in elections, they will have nothing in the name of telling their achievements, which BJP can benefit from
 yah vakt kshetreey dalon ko apni nai ranneeti banane kaa he
 They will also need to take a stand on national issues, raising their level from caste, region and appeasement politics
 sach to yah he ki bijepi ne kshetreey dalon ke liye aage kuan-peeche khai jaisi sthiti paidaa kar di he
 Ratan Mani Lal says that almost all the regional parties, except the regional parties of Jammu and Kashmir, were less vocal during the discussion on Article 370 in Parliament
 basapa bhi sarkaar ke saath dikhi
 The regional parties of other states of the country also feel that the mood of the country is in line with the decision on Article 370
 es main janamat ke khilaaf bolne kii unhen keemat chukaani pad sakati he
 At the same time, regional parties also feel that they do not have influence in the valley
 aise main anuchhed 370 kaa virodh karne kaa kya matlab
 However, parties like JDU and Samajwadi Party certainly opposed it
 iske peeche muslim votbank politics ho sakati he
 Because Kashmir is considered a Muslim Dominated Area
 aise main in dalon ko lagata he ki anuchhed 370 par sarkaar ko saport karne se muslim voton kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 However, this may prove to be a sham for these parties
 kyonki hindu-muslim raajnneeti kii sataha par bijepi ne ab kshetreey dalon ke liye koi gunjaaish hi nahin chodi he
 After attempting to molest a woman, she is killed and later dies

 yahaan kisi bhi yug main aisa shaayad hi ho paae

 "there is a severe lack of accountability in the police administration in Bihar
