 People felt that though they speak less, there is a kind of political seriousness

 Rahul Gandhi became famous for not speaking

 When the Lokpal was debated, the youth found Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi loksabhaa main lokapal ko sanvaidhanik darja die jane kaa ek parchaa padhakar gaayab ho gaye
 This time too, it seemed that he is the same Rahul Gandhi who has run away from responsibility

 This will only happen when this politician takes himself on an honest path
 itnaa aasaan nahin he
 It will also require honest atonement
 kya rahul aisa kar paaenge
 Will he always go ahead by targeting Narendra Modi or will he also be ready to criticize himself? unhen narendra modi kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie
 Prime Minister Modi has given him a chance to become Rahul more than the Congress did not
 tippaniyan The speech in the rally and Parliament was done, will Rahul talk to the press now as usual leader
 vaise unke press se baat karne ko lekar main bahut utsahit nahin rahata hum
 This task is very easy while in opposition
 vipaksh ke dinon main kai netaa har din uplabdh rahete hai
 It seems that these are the most honest soldiers of democracy
 magar haal ke raajnneetik anubhav bataate hai ki satta main aate hi vahi rajaneta press se dur ho jaataa he
 At rallies, the media abuses and presses the questions before the press and confronts the supporters when asked questions to discredit the asker
 is paimaane par aap kisi bhi netaa kaa moolyankan kar sakate hai
 Therefore, if Rahul talks to the press, it is good and if you do not make the mistake of looking at the profile of journalists while talking, it is even better
 vaise mere paas unase poochne ke liye bahut kuch to nahin he, sivaay iske ki bolte hue kurte kii baanhen marodana kiske kehane par band kar diya! Narendra Modi was right that someone is speaking in anger
 ye or baat he ki khud narendra modi bhi gusse main hi bolaa karte the
 In the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi laughed a little and implicated a little
 ve pehali baar vaakchaturaai ke liye maahir maane jane vaale bijepi khemon se loha le rahe the
 Started tricking them
 acha aapke pradhanmantri nahin hai
 You belong to the country, but are you not? maine aapke pradhanmantri kaha to aapako kyon bura lag gaya
 Rahul Gandhi was speaking as a general in the Lok Sabha
 apane upar se rahul hone kaa lod utaar diya tha
 He felt free from worrying about which jokes the opposing camp would be making on social media
 is lihaaz se soshal media kaa pappu aaj sachmuch paas ho gaya! Remember one thing
 bolnaa hameshaa bolne kii style se asardaar nahin hota he
 Political conditions also give strength to your spoken
 iske alaava rajaneta kii apni eemaandaaree bhi bolne ke prati gambhirtha paidaa karti he
 He was also praised when Rahul Gandhi gave a Kalawati speech in the Lok Sabha
 logon ko laga tha ki bhale kam bolte hai magar ek kism kii raajnneetik gambhirtha he
 But that seriousness soon disappeared
 rahul gandhi na bolne ke liye hi mashhoor ho gaye
 He himself greatly helped to create this image
 lokapal par jab bahes hui tab yuvaaon ne rahul gandhi ko dhundha tha
 Rahul Gandhi disappeared by reading a form of giving constitutional status to Lokpal in the Lok Sabha
 is baar bhi gaayab hue to laga ki ye vahi rahul gandhi hai jo zimmedaari se bhaagate rahe hai
 If we return now, their examination is going to be tough again
 rahul kii zindagi main ravivaar or somvaar ke ye bhaashan tabhi yaadgaar banenge jab ve apni nitiyon ko lekar eemaandaaree se aage badhenge
 Will be able to afford to move the Congress towards an alternative economic policy politics

 The Delhi government indicated to take legal action against Arvind Kejriwal
 darasal, kejariwal ne bijli or pani ke bilon main badhotaree ke khilaaf pradarshan ke dauraan ek upabhokta ke bijli conection ko avaidh rup se behaal kar diya
 The Delhi government has accused him of spreading chaos and chaos in the city

 kaala hiran ke shikaar maamle main jodhpur kii nichali adaalat se paanch aaropee bari ho gaye, jabaki salmaan khan ko 5 saal kii sajaa samet 10 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya gaya he
 The judge has written in his judgment that Salman Khan is guilty in the case of deer hunting
 court ne kaha ki salmaan khan ek abhinayta hai or aisa vyakti agar sangrakshit kaale hiranon kaa shikaar karegaa to or log bhi is disha main prerit ho sakate hai
 As the incidence of killing wildlife is increasing these days, it should be punished without giving the benefit of doubt to Khan
 abhinayta hone kii sajaa na miliwahin salmaan ke vakil kaa kahana he ki salmaan khan film abhinayta hai or isi vajah se unhen dandit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The court's job is not to punish for setting precedents
 abhinayta hone kaa dand salmaan khan ko nahin milanaa chahie
 In this judgment, Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Sonali Bendre were acquitted, as the prosecution has not been able to prove their guilt
 gavaahon ke bayaan se bhi yah sabit nahin hota he ki in logon ne shikaar karne ke liye salmaan khan ko uksaaya tha
 There is a similar argument that what the stars went to do with Salman Khan at Dhani in Guru Jambheshwar Nagar, Kankani village, 30 km from Jodhpur at 2:00 pm
 faisle main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki in saare sitaron kii vajah se kai logon ke ghar chalate hai
 These people are associated with the film world
 inako sajaa hone se bahut saare logon kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Salman Khan's lawyer says the same logic should apply to his client as well
 hiran tak kaise pahunchesalmaan?vahiin dushyant singh naam kaa vyakti jo sabhi logon ko hiran ke shikaar ke liye kankaani gaanv lekar gaya tha, use bhi chhod diya gaya he
 Now the question arises how Salman Khan knew there is a deer in the village
 agar sthaneey vyakti ne nahin bataaya he to mumbai se aae salmaan khan us gaanv main kaise pahunche
 In such a situation, the release of Dushyant Singh is also being questioned
 arms act main bari ho gaye to shikaar kaise kiya?arms act ke tahat charge frem hone kii vajah se hi 18 saal baad is cese main sunwaayee shuru ho pai thi, jin hathiyaaron se salmaan khan ne do kaale hiranon kaa shikaar kiya
 In the same, if he is acquitted in the Arms Act, then what is the victim Salman Khan done? arms act main bari hone ke is faisle main zikr nahin kiya gaya he
 On this ground, the Jodhpur High Court acquitted Salman Khan in the case of two chinkara poaching at the horse farm Mathania
 nichali adaalat ne us maamle main bhi salmaan khan ko chhodkar baaki sabhi aropiyon ko bari kar diya tha
 The High Court had asked whether Salman Khan was driving himself when all the accused were acquitted
 khud hi bandook chalaa rahe the or mumbai se aakar khud hi rasta khojate hue ghoda farm mathania pahunch gaye the
 Now the same questions can also arise in this case

 mahabuuba mufti tabhi se bhartiya janata party par hamalavar hai
 Former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda is preparing a new equation
 unhone beete maheene rohtak main nae tevar main 'mahareli' kii or chunavi ranneeti taiyaar karne ke liye samarthak vidhayakon tathaa purv mantriyon ke saath 36 sadasyeey cameti banaai
 This suggests that Hooda may need Congress, but he no longer needs Congress
 hooda virdohi abhaya chautaala se bhi pingen badha rahe hai
 "we can go to any extent to stop the BJP in the assembly elections," says Aftab Ahmed, a member of Hooda's election committee and former minister
 '' hooda ne anuchhed 370 ke masale par party line se itar centre sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya he
 He also said, "the Congress has lost something
 ''darasal, yah hooda kii majaburi bhi he, kyonki dabaav banane ke baavjood hikeman ne unke haath main pradesh kii bagdor nahin saunpi he
 In Haryana, the Congress is divided into several factions, of which Hooda is the largest faction
 inke alaava congress ke media prabharee randeep surajevaala, vidhayak kiran choudhary, vidhayak captain ajay yadav, kumari shailaja aadi bhi alag-alag guton kii numaaindgi karte hai

" ''pichley chah varshon main congress hikeman teen baar pradesh prabharee badal chukaa he, par ve bhi gutbaji khatm nahin kar paae
 The current incharge is Ghulam Nabi Azad, but even after the assembly elections are near, he is absent from the state
 hooda ko lagata he ki in paristhitiyon main congress sattarudh bhaajapa kaa muqabla nahin kar paaegi, isliye unhone gaiyr congressi jameen taiyaar kerani shuru kar di he
 Neither did he take the name of Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi in Rohtak's rally nor get his posters installed
 hooda ke nae sameekaran main indian neshnal lokdal (inelo) shaamil ho saktaa he
 The INLD chief, Oprakash Chautala, says he has no objection to going with any anti-congress like-minded party
 hooda or chautaala kii jat tathaa gramin madadaataaon par khaasi pakad he
 The BJP may be troubled by their coming together
 aam aadmi party ne apane pattey nahin khole hai, par vah hooda ke saath ja sakati he
 At the same time, former MP Rajkumar Saini, who broke away from the BJP and formed the party, says, "we are not anti-jat
" '' isse pehle ve isi mudde par chautaala or hooda ko gherte rahe hai
 In lieu of them, Sur is also being considered a part of Hooda's political moves
 kurukshetra ke varisht patrkaar sarbajot singh duggal kehete hai, ''hooda ne anuchhed 370 kaa samarthan khaas ranneeti ke tahat kiya he, taaki chunaav main is mudde par bhaajapa ko kaata ja sake
 "but state BJP president Subhash Barala says," Hooda's move will not stop us
 '' is bich, anuchhed 370 par hooda kerrukh se mewati muslim bahul kshetron ke congressi asamanjas main hai
 At least eight seats in the state are directly influenced by the Meo Muslim voters

 But the government forgot us
 ' seetaram paal khud ye kehete hai kii jab padmashri dekar sarkaar hi bhul gayi to ham bhi bhul jaayenge
 It should be burned on my funeral pyre after my death and i would like to say one thing to the government that before giving such honor, it should be respected by examining its financial condition so that it can be respected

 gaanv main logon ko kaam dene ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se mahatma gandhi rashtriya rojgaar guarantee yojana yani manaregaa yojana shuru kii thi
 But if we look at the figures of Rajasthan, this Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Unemployment Guarantee Scheme will be seen
 yakeen karnaa mushkil he ki manaregaa ke tahat rajya main mahaj 13 hajaar logon ko 100 din kaa rojgaar mila he
 Whereas ever since this scheme has been implemented, it has never happened that less than 2
5 lakh people get 100 days of employment
 aaj tak samvaadadaata ne gaanvon main jaakar halaat kaa jayja liya to samasya aankadon main kahin zyada dikhaai di
 After 6 months in Nimera village of Jaipur district, 12 lakhs work was sought under MNREGA
 lekin sirf saat lakh rupee kaa kaam aayaa he
 The job card of 400 unemployed people remains in the village
 200 rupee kii majdoor ke hisaab se 50 mazdooron ko ek din kaam par rakhane ke hisaab se do maheene kaa kaam he or phir berozegaar
 Most of the women do the work, it is not just the condition of this panchayat, but the panchayats like Begus and Fagi nearby either do not have any work or are negligible
 isaki vajah se manaregaa main purushon ne kaam par aana hi band kar diya he
 Because depending on MNREGA, they earn 10 to 15 thousand rupees in a year
 jisase ghar nahin chal saktaa
 So only women come
 kaam karanevaali mahilaon kaa kahana he ki har 15 din baad ghar baithna padataa he, aise main ghar kaise chale?ye hai manaregaa ke tarah rojgaar ke aankade-varsh 2015-16 main 4
 69 people got 100 days of employment
 -varsh 2016-17 main 4
 27 lakh people got 100 days of employment
 -jabaki 31 oktober 2017 tak mahaj 13302 logon ko hi 100 din kaa rojgaar mila
 On the other hand, the government spent 97 percent of the budget of MNREGA
 aise main ab kaam kaise denge
 These are the figures of the MNREGA scheme - under the MNREGA, new job cards are not only being created but are also decreasing
 -2015-16 main rajasthan main 99
 There were 36 lakh MNREGA job card holders
 -2016-17 main 4
 95 with a shortfall of 12 lakhs
 24 job cardedhari rah gaye
 This year, their number decreased to 94000 from 65000
 59 rah gai he
 Labor budget is getting reduced in 2015-2016
 9 lakh tha
 It increased to 2300 lakhs in 2016-17
 -jabaki 2017-18 main ye ghataakar 2000 lakh kar diya gaya he
 This year, one lakh 83 thousand 836 works started
 jisamen se mahaj 635(0
 36) Only they are completed
 yani 99 fisadi adhure hai
 Compared to previous years, only 13 percent people got 100 days of work
 jabaki 97 fisadi bajet khatm ho gaya he
 The public is asking for employment and the Minister of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj is saying that those seeking employment are not coming
 adhikari nahin bana rahe hai job karbopana naam nahin bataane kii shart paramanaregaase jude adhikariyon ne kaha ki rojgaar maangane waalon kii sankhya lagaataar bad rahi he lekin ham job card nahin bana rahe hai
 The reason is that there is no work
 is tarah band ho sakati he yojnamanaregaa ke tahat sarkari jameenon par kaccha kaam hota he or ye pichley 10-15 saalon main puure ho gaye hai
 There is not much government land in the villages for raw work
 ab to manaregaa ke niyam badalen tabhi kuch ho saktaa he varna ye yojana is rup main band ho jaaegi

 The party in-charge PC Chacko and the three working presidents of the Pradesh Congress Committee have questioned the decision of the Delhi unit of the Congress, Sheila Dixit, to appoint district and block supervisors
 chaako or kaaryakari adhyakshon haaron yusuf, rajesh lilothia or devendra yadav ne isko lekar shila ko patr likhaa he
 According to sources, he has also sent copies of these letters to the party high command
 chaako ne aarope lagaaya he ki unhen bina soochna die shila dikshit ne 14 jila congress cameti paryvekshak or 280 block congress cameti paryvekshak niyukt kiye hai
 The three working presidents said, "rahul Gandhi gave us responsibility in Delhi and said that we have to work collectively for Delhi
" yah dukhad he ki is faisle main shila dikshit ne hamase kisi prakaar kii koi raay nahin lee
 This infighting in the Delhi Congress is seen at a time when the leadership crisis in the Congress has deepened
 aisa lag rahaa he ki congress main nitigat or party se jude faislon par bhi kaaphi uhapoh kii sthiti bani hui he
 Similarly, in a letter issued by the 'congress President', it has been said that Balasaheb Thorat has been made the President of Maharashtra Congress
 thoraat se pehle ashok chahvan maharashtra congress ke adhyaksh the
 Ashok Chavan resigned his post due to the party's poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections
 thoraat ko yah jimmedaari rajya main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle di gai he
 Prior to the announcement of Balasaheb Thorat's name as Maharashtra Congress President, Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal said that the Hon'ble Congress President has given his approval for the appointment of new people as Maharashtra Congress President and Executive Chairman
 lekin sawaal is baat kaa he ki jab rahul gandhi ne apane congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya he to phir kis adhyaksh kii sahmati se thoraat ko yah jimmedaari di gai he
 After this announcement by KC Venugopal, people and party workers themselves are seen to be in a dilemma about Rahul Gandhi leaving the post of party president
 in sab ke bich NDTV se khaas baatcheet main ek varisht congressi netaa ne kaha ki rahul gandhi abhi bhi party ke adhyaksh hai
 He said that his resignation has not yet been accepted by the Congress Working Committee
 aise main yah kahana ki vah party adhyaksh nahin hai yah galat he
 He said that who has to make a new president in any state anyway, that he has taken all such decisions only on June 27

 Kapil said, look at Ricky Ponting

 This is not the way to judge a captain in this way

 kendriya naagarik uddyan mantri ajit singh ne upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii
 This meeting of Ajit Singh comes at a time when there is a dispute between Jet Airways and Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways over the Rs 2,058 crore deal
 haalanki, sutron kaa kahana he ki yah raajnneetik mulaakaat thi, kyonki sonia gandhi upie kii adhyaksh hai, jabaki ajit singh kaa rashtriya lok dal (areldi) sattadhari gathbandhan kaa hissaa he
 The jet-etihad deal is also believed to have come up for discussion during negotiations between the two

 The Prime Minister's Office issued a statement after this, rejecting such reports that there were differences in the government regarding the deal
 sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha ki share (jet airways ke share aitihaad ko bechney ke) saude kii philhal jaanch kii ja rahi he
 The statement said there was no disagreement between the ministries on the agreement between Abu Dhabi and India over increasing the authorized number of flights
 abu dhabi kii aitihaad airways ne 24 april ko jet airways main 24 pratishat hissedari kharidne kaa sauda 2,058 karod rupee main kiya tha
 The decision on the deal was deferred by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) on 13 June
 board ne kaha ki saude main jet airways par niyantran or malikana haq dhaanche ko lekar sthiti or spasht kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Jet Chairman Naresh Goyal holds a 51 percent stake in Jet Airways
 naagarik uddyan mantri ajit singh ne haalanki, is saude kaa majbootee se bachaav kiya he
 Ajit Singh said, 'those who are opposing it, they are doing more politics and less talking of facts
 yah kaaphi mahatvapurn sauda he, naagarik uddyan kshetra main yah pehla bada sauda he
 In terms of FDI, it is bigger than any other deal this year
 ' The fight between the Congress and the BJP for the sake of gaining political space with each other has certainly reached an ugly and dangerous point in Gujarat

 On the other hand, when about 45,000 migrants were forced to flee from Gujarat, the Congress came to the rescue of Thakor and reprimanded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for seeking votes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and the people of these two states (in Gujarat)

 As a result, migrant laborers from Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Aravalli and Ahmedabad got into panic and fled

 In Vadnagar in Mehsana district, a mob of 200 Thakore army workers attacked a factory and beat up migrant laborers

 He says that a similar incident occurred when the Congress wooed and pitched the Patidar leader Hardik Patel to separate a significant portion of the Patel from the BJP
 pandya ne kaha, ''yah saaf taur par lagaataar baantne kii raajnneeti kar rahi congress kii karstani he
 But it will strengthen us (BJP) because we will be seen standing in favor of a united India
 ''balaatkaar ko lekar gusse ke alaava thakor sena 'uttar bharatiyon' ko gujarat main naukariyon se baahar karne kii maang bhi kar rahi he

 When Congress President Rahul Gandhi condemned the violence in the state, the Chief Minister reacted sharply to it
 roopaani ne kaha, ''yah sharmnaak he ki rahul gandhi pehle gujarat main hinsa bhadakaate hai or phir isaki bhatrsana karte hai
 If they are really serious, then they should take action against their party leaders and workers who are trying to divide the society by inciting violence
 ''is bich kshatriya thakor sena civil socity samoohon ke nishane par bhi aa gai
 He forced Thakor to issue a statement and ask his supporters to stop targeting Hindi speakers
 thakor ne apane bayaan main kaha, ''ve bhi hamaare bhai hai
 Thakor had earlier distanced himself from the violence in Vadnagar, but he was adamant on his demand for 'gujarat Gujaratis'
 unhone kaha, ''vadnagar main jo kuch hua, main uskaa samarthan nahin karata
 non-gujaratis are also Hindustani

 Party President Rahul Gandhi is adamant on resigning and is demanding a new president
 buudhvaar ko rahul gandhi ne kaha ki party main jald se jald adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav hona chahie, vah ab is pad par nahin hai
 Not only this, Rahul believes that the new president of the party should have been elected a month in advance
 buudhvaar ko rahul gandhi ne kaha ki vah kisi bhi keemat par istipha waapas lene ke mood main nahin hai
 He said that elections should be held for this post at the earliest, i am not in this position
 bataa den ki 23 may ko chunaav nattejey aane ke baad rahul gandhi ne congress varking cameti kii baithak main istife kii peshkash kar di thi
 Rahul believes that it is too late for the party to elect a new president
 party ko jald se jald varking cameti kii baithak bulaakar is par faisla karnaa chahie
 At the same time, he says that he will no longer be a part of this process
 unhone kaha ki varking cameti kii baithak kab bulaai jaaegi, ye bhi samiti ke sadsy hi tay karenge
 i will not call a meeting
 gauratlab he ki jab se rahul gandhi ne congress party ke adhyaksh pad se istipha dene kii baat kahi he tabhi se party main halchal machi hui he
 He also expressed displeasure over the fact that no leader took responsibility for the defeat nor did anyone resign after his offer

 The Vikram Lander of ISRO (indian Space Research Organization )'s Chandrayaan-2 is not the only vehicle that has lost contact
 antariksh vigyaan ke itihaas main isse pehle bhi aisa ho chukaa he
 a vehicle from the European Space Agency (ESA) that lost contact was revealed after 12 years
 vah mila bhi lekin usase sampark nahin ho paaya
 That is, there is no need to lose hope
 isro vaigyanikon ne to vikram lander ko kareeb 35 ghante baad hi khoj liya tha
 Now the effort is being made only to get in touch with Vikram Lander
 aaie jaanate hai us yaan kii rahasyamayi kahani, jo 12 saal baad mila thaye he european spes agency ke beagal-2 yaan kaa artistic chitra
 (photo-esa) The European Space Agency (ESA) launched a lander for Mars on 2 June 2003
 iskaa naam tha beagal-2
 The name of the entire mission was Mars Express Mission
 june main launch kiye gaye is lander ko 6 maheene baad yani 19 disambar 2003 ko mangal par pahunchnaa tha
 The vehicle also arrived but that day it lost contact with the European Space Agency
 kareeb dhai maheenon tak beagal-2 se sampark karne kii koshish kii gai
 But he did not reply to any message sent from Earth
 ant main farvari 2004 main is mishan ko naakaam ghoshit kar diya gaya
 The lander was seen in three different parts, its parachute and rear cover
 (photo-nasa)esa ne beagal-2 mishan ko mangal par isliye bheja tha taaki vahaan ke jariye jivan kii sambhaavna kaa pataa lagaaya ja sake
 After losing contact with Beagle, several attempts were made to contact the orbiter of the ESA Mars Expression Mission
 lekin aisa sambhav nahin hua
 No such pictures were found from the orbiter to find out what happened there
 kareeb 12 saal baad jab america antariksh agency nasa (NASA) kaa yaan mars riconcense orbitor mangal se jaankariyaan jamaa karne ke liye uski kaksha main chakkar laga rahaa tha, tab usne 16 janvari 2015 ko beagal-2 kii tasviren leen

 This area of mars is called Isidis Planesia
 nasa ke mangalayan ne lee thi beagal-2 kii aisi tasviir
 Analyzing nasa's photos, it was found that most of the Beagle-2 is safe
 usne sahi tareeke se landing kii he, lekin landing ke samay uskaa solar panel kharaab ho gaya
 Due to this the entire Beagle-2 was not getting energy
 urja nahin milane se sanchaar ke liye lagaae gaye antina ne kaam karnaa band kar diya
 So it lost contact
 dobaaraa sanchaar sthapit hi nahin ho paaya
 Something similar has happened with Vikram Lander
 The same has happened with Vikram Lander of Chandrayaan-2, the second moon mission in India

 About 35 hours later, ISRO scientists found a picture of Vikram Lander, which revealed that it was slanting about 500 meters away from the fixed location
 ab vaigyanik usase sampark sthapit karnaa chaah rahe hai, taaki aage ke prayog ho saken
 The murder case of 'modi Chowk' in Darbhanga may seem to be changing in the land dispute, but some questions are still standing in front of the police
 masalan ghayal kamaldev yadav urf bholaa yadav ke bayaan par praathmiki darz na kar police neghar kii mahila ke bayaan par praathmiki darz kyon kii? jabaki peedit kamaldev bolne kii sthiti main hai or ghatana ke samay bhi police ko apana bayaan darz karaayaa tha
 Second question, when the reason behind the incident is not clear, then why are the police focused on the old land scam? Third question, can a person not be killed due to any other reasons, due to land dispute? Fourth question, if the land dispute was old then why was the murder now? What happened on the day of the murder? The fifth question, why the FIR was lodged on the statement of the woman of the house while a person injured in the incident is alive and in a state of speaking

 The wounds of farmers growing basmati paddy in Madhya Pradesh once again turned green on March 6 when Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who was sitting on a dharna in Bhopal, raised his voice against the discriminatory policy of the Agriculture and Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA)
 pradesh sarkaar kii tamaam koshishon ke baavjood apida madhya pradesh ko basmati ugane vaale rajyon kii suchi main shaamil karne ko taiyaar nahin
 Farmers have to bear the brunt of this
 madhya pradesh khud ko basmati chaaval paidaa karne vaale rajyon kii shrenee main rakhwane ke prayaas lambey samay se karata aa rahaa he
 In November, this effort was showing color
 tab krishi upajon ko patent karne vaali sanstha jeeographical indication register (jiiar) ne kendriya krishi vibhaag se madhya pradesh ko basmati ugane vaale rajyon kii suchi main shaamil karne kii sifarish kar di thi
 On this, the Central Government handed over the responsibility of deciding the area to grow basmati in the country
 apida ne is shrenee main uttar pradesh, haryana, punjab, himachal pradesh, uttarakhand or jammu-kashmir ko to is suchi main rakhaa lekin madhya pradesh ko shaamil nahin kiya
 This has given a big shock to the farmers families of the state who have been cultivating this aromatic basmati paddy for generations
 apida ke nirnay se pradesh sarkaar sakate main he kyonki lagbhag ek shatabdi se pradesh main basmati dhan kii kheti hoti aa rahi he
 But APEDA is not ready to accept this claim of the state
 darasal, apida ne basmati dhan ko madhya pradesh kii mul fasal hi nahin mana he
 In its reply to the state agriculture department, APEDA rejected its claim that farmers here do not traditionally cultivate basmati
 yah bhi ki basmati uttar pradesh, punjab, uttarakhand or haryana kii mul fasal he
 The same logic of APEDA is coming in the way of Madhya Pradesh getting the status of basmati growing state
 apida kaa yah bhi kahana he ki madhya pradesh ko nai pravishti ke rup main suchi main shaamil kiya jaataa he to yah basmati ugane vaale duusare rajyon ke saath ninsaphi hogi
 The fragrance of Basmati paddy in Joginder Singh's farm near Jigasoli village near Gwalior spreads far and wide
 lekin singh ko iskaa khaas phayda nahin miltaa
 They can neither send this paddy for export nor do they get a fair price for it
 pradesh ke basmati dhan kii khaasiyat yah he ki yahaan ke kisaan rasinic urvarak kaa istemaal kam-se-kam karte hai
 The paddy crop here is completely dependent on the rainy water
 duusare rajyon ke kisaan paidaavaar badhaane ke liye kitnashak, rasinic khaad or sinchai ke sadhano kaa istemaal karte hai
 If the state gets the status of basmati growing state, then the farmers here will be able to climb the stairs of progress
 chaaval aadhaarit kai udyog bhi rajya main lag sakenge, or isse kai tarah ke rojgaron kaa srijan hoga
 Madhya Pradesh can export its basmati rice only if APEDA considers it a basmati growing state
 philhal yahaan ke kisaan apni fasal kam daamon par dallalon ke haathon bechney par majaboor hai
 On joining this list, like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, Basmati can also make its own brand of rice
 apida ke is nirnay ke khilaaf pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne morcha khol diya he
 The CM had staged a sit-in in Bhopal demanding compensation from the Central Government for the crop of the farmers of the state, which was devastated by the unseasonal rains
 yahaan par unhone apida par bhedbhaav karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Madhya Pradesh has fought a long battle to join the list of basmati paddy growing state
 rajya main muraina, bhind, gwalior, datia, shivpuri, guna, vidisha samet 14 jilon main kareeb teen lakh acre kshetra main basmati dhan kii kheti ho rahi he
 The agriculture department of the state had proved before the GIR many historical facts that Basmati paddy is being grown here since before 1931
 iske liye puraane gajetir kaa hawala bhi diya tha
 The state government had also argued that the climate of the areas situated along the banks of river Narmada from Chambal River is very favorable for basmati rice cultivation
 pradesh sarkaar ke in tarkon ko jiiar ne maan liya tha
 But APEDA is not ready to accept them
 isiilie vah basmati dhan ko madhya pradesh kii mul fasal bhi nahin maan rahaa he
 At present, the Basmati farmers of the state cannot do anything other than feeling sorry for their condition
 cigaura gaanv ke badrinarayan bataate hai, ''hamaara basmati chaaval 40 se 50 ru
 Hardly sold per kg
 '' jabaki in dinon basmati chaaval kaa bazaar mulya 100 se 125 ru
 Per kg
 chunki madhya pradesh basmati ko kanoonee rup se niryaat bhi nahin kar saktaa he
 This is the reason that the state is forced to sell its paddy at low prices to those states which have got the status of exporter
 mukhyamantri chouhan kaa maananaa he ki apida pradesh ke kisaanon ke saath ninsaphi kar rahaa he
 In his words, "APEDA is not considering Madhya Pradesh as a basmati paddy growing state
 yah rajya ke kisaanon ke hiton ke khilaaf he
 Its attitude is like Pakistan, which has always been opposed to the Indian basmati paddy farmers
 apida kaa ravaiya rashtriya hit ke bhi khilaaf he
 "chauhan has told the farmers that they will once again put this issue in front of the central government and the farmers of the state will continue to get their rightful rights
" philhal kisaanon ke paas ummid banaae rakhane ke alaava or koi rasta bhi nahin he
 bjp's firebrand leader Narendra Modi should just have a chance to attack the Congress
 ahmedabad main ek kaarykram ke dauraan modi ne kai morche par congress ko aaropon or iljaamon ke kathghare main khadaa kiya
 Whether it is the use of CBI for its own benefit, the Central Government's Bharat Nirman advertisement or the incident of Naxalite attack in Chhattisgarh
 modi ne gandhi parivaar par hallaa bolte hue kaha ki congress bas ek parivaar ke liye he
 Modi told former NSUI workers that the Congress party betrayed him
 sibiai ke galat istemaal par modi ne sarkaar ko chetavanee di or kaha ki sarkaar par kisi ko bharosa nahin he
 Modi also pointed fingers at the Congress 'bharat Nirman' and said that there is a 'doubt' on Bharat Nirman
 mauka tha ahmedabad main hajaaron congressi kaaryakartaaon ke bijepi main shaamil hone kaa
 Around 6000 workers of NSUI and Youth Congress secured primary membership of the BJP at the ceremony
 saath hi youth congress ke 56 adhikariyon ne bhi bijepi kaa daaman thama
 It is very clear that the BJP has given a big shock to the Congress in Gujarat and Narendra Modi has made a big dent in the electoral strategy of Rahul Gandhi, the Congress prince
 congressi kaaryakartaaon kaa bijepi main shaamil hona apane aap main hi congress ke liye buree khabar he
 But even then, Modi targeted the Congress by making the government advertisement of Bharat Nirman a weapon
 gujarat main 2 june ko 2 siton par loksabhaa kaa upachunaav he
 Modi is now claiming his victory and the defeat of the Congress by beating the tables
 philhal pehla round modi ke paksh main hi jaataa dikh rahaa he kyonki ek ore jahaan rahul gandhi yuvaaon ko party se jodne kii jitod koshish main lage hai vahiin gujarat main khud congress ke hi hajaaron kaaryakartaaon ne unki mehnat par pani pher diya he
 The decision on adultery law came today
 stri-purush ke vivahetar sambandhon se judi bhartiya dand samhita (ipisi) kii dhara-497 parasupreme courtki samvidhan peeth ne faisla sunaaya
 Today's decision made it clear that the Court considered the right of women to be paramount, while the right to equality was paramount
 supreme court kii paanch sadasyeey peeth ne ekamat se faisla sunaaya ki vyabhichaar aparaadh nahin he
 On August 2, the case was heard in the country's top court
 tab adaalat ne kaha tha, 'vyabhichaar kanoon mahilaon kaa pakshdhar lagata he lekin asal main yah mahila virdohi he
 If the wife can fulfill someone's wish at the behest of her husband, then it cannot be considered as Indian morality at all
 'adaalat ne aage kaha, shaadishuda sambandh mempati-patnidonon kii ek baraabar jimmedaari he
 Then why did the single wife suffer more than the husband? This is the reason why the Supreme Court is considering this law as archaic
 supreme court main ab tak kii sunwaayee se saaf he ki adalati jirah mukhya rup se samanta or gaiyr-samanta ke aasapaas chali
 The court then argued that the penal provision on adultery was an indirect violation of the right to equality under the Constitution as it treats married men and married women differently
 mahila ke paksh main khadaa court?jaisaa ki supreme court purv main kah chukaa he kivyabhichaar kanoonlagata to mahila samarthak he lekin he mahilaon ke viruddh
 It is clear from this logic that the basis of the judgment points to the right of equality between men and women
 jabaki is maamle main supreme court main kuch saal pehle ek arji daakhil kar kaha gaya tha ki ye samvidhan ke anuchhed-14 yani samanta kii bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 If a case can be filed against a man for a crime, then why not against the woman? This application was rejected by the Supreme Court
 court ne mahila ko kamjor paksh mana or kaha tha ki aise main unke khilaaf cese nahin chalaaya ja saktaa
 However, it could not be clear from the arguments of the court that when the case will be filed against the man, how can the woman be considered as weak side

 The Indian team is in danger of losing this four-test series after an embarrassing defeat against England in two successive Tests in Mumbai and Kolkata
 pehla test jeetne ke baad bhartiya team is shrinkhalaa main 2-1 se peeche chal rahi he
 In such a situation, if the players of Team India do not improve their performance, then they may have to lose this series in Nagpur Test and after that the round of criticism will start, it can destroy the career of many players

 In 1984–85, England, led by David Gawer, had set India on its own soil

 In such a situation, he would not miss any chance to match Gaver's record

 While Monty Panesar has taken 16 wickets in three matches, Graeme Swann has taken Team India batsmen to the backfoot with 17 wickets
 haalanki pragyan ojha ne ab tak sabase adhik 19 wicket hasil kiye hai lekin unka yah pradarshan nirnaayak nahin rahaa he
 For India, Cheteshwar Pujara and Virender Sehwag have been somewhat successful in batting
 pujaara ne ab tak bharat kii ore se sabase adhik 412 ran banaae hai vahiin sahvaag teen maichon main 253 ran banaakar duusare sthaan par he
 The lack of performance of Indian batsmen can be gauged from the fact that off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin is in third place with Gautam Gambhir scoring 214 runs
 viraat kohli teen maichon main sirf 85 ran bana sake hai to captain mahendra singh dhoni 92 ran

 Meanwhile, former captain Mohinder Amarnath has added to his woes by saying that Dhoni could not be removed from the captaincy despite losing in two consecutive Test series due to internal pressure
 upar se dhoni or gambheer ke bich ke vivaad ke sambandh main chhan kar aa rahi khabaren bhi team india ke liye achche sanket nahin hai
 According to these reports, Dhoni has complained to BCCI about Gambhir that his attitude on the field is selfish

 film 'anaarakali of aara' abhi relies hone ko he, aise main swara bhaskar abhinit is film kii kaaphi charchaa he
 The film's director Avinas Das told during an interview that Sonam Kapoor wept when she saw this film
 film 'anaarakali of aara' un mahilaon kii kahani he jo duurastha evam pichde kshetron main naach-gaakar apana guzar-basar karti hai
 Incidents of molesting these women are common among the crowd, but a few of these women also raise their voice against these excesses
 avinas bataate hai, 'sonam kapur ne jab film dekhi to vah dahaad markar rone lagi
 He asked if all this happens in our country? Because Sonam had never seen such a truth and i believe that a large section of the country is unaware of this reality
 'exclusive: manavir ke saath nahin badla nitibha kaa rishtabihar kii devi or haryana kisapana choudhariunhin mahilaon kaa udhaaharan hai
 'anarkali of Aara' is putting the passion and apathy of these women on screen
 isamen swara bhaskar ne apane abhinay se mukhya kirdaar ko jeevant kiya he
 Inspired by the appearances of Tara Bano of Faizabad and the Goddess of Bihar, Avinash Das of Darbhanga wrote the screenplay of 'anarkali of Ara' and took up the task of directing it himself
 haalanki, yah film kisi kii byopic par aadhaarit nahin he, lekin isamen sachhee ghatnaon ko samahit kiya gaya he
 In an exclusive chat with IANS, the film's director and writer Avinash Das said, "my film is considered by many to be a biopic, but it is not a biopic but based on true events
" desh ke chote or pichde kshetron main aaj bhi is tarah kii mahilaayein hai jo naach-gaakar apni aajeevika chalaati hai, lekin galati tab ho jaati hai jab inhen'tecon for granted'maan liya jaataa he
 'avinash says,' My film focuses on some people in the society, who show such petty mentality
 'is film ke liye prerana kahaan se mili? jawaab main vah kehete hai, 'maine faijabad kii tara bano ke bare main kaaphi shodh kiya he

 For the first time in our country, a film has been made on Street Singer
 yah apni tarah kii pehali film he jo naach-gaakar aajeevika chalaane vaali mahilaon kii aapbeetee bayaan kar rahi he
 Its characters are fictional, but the events are true
 ''anaarakali of aara' ke kuch drishy online li hue hai
 Highlighting the entire scenario, Avinash says, 'two-three scenes of the film have leaked, but only good
 hamen isse saavdhaan hone kaa mauka mila
 In today's era, only the entire film gets leaked
 'salmaan-shahrukh kii tarah nahin karatin ye kaam, isliye aaj hit hai kanganvinaash sensor board ke kaamkaaj se bahut khafa hai
 He expresses his anger, saying, 'the censor board is absolutely ridiculous
 unhone itane betuke tark dekar ham par dabaav banaaya ki main bataa nahin saktaa
 In one of the dialogues of the film, there is a mention of the Sundar incident, then we were asked to remove it by citing hurting the sentiments of the people
 ek jagah arjuna aawaara kaa zikr he to arjuna hataane ko kaha, taaki logon kii bhavanaaen aahat na ho jaaen
 With such a child, a film gets made somewhere
 'vah kehete hai, 'kai deshon main sensor board hi nahin he, lekin hamaare yahaan naitik paharedaar ke rup main sensor board ko baitha diya gaya he jo betuke tark dekar bosiyat jhaadta rahata he

 Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt's Gully Boy is getting good response from the audience
 release se pehle hi is film kaa jabardast crez dekhne ko mil rahaa tha
 Ever since the trailer came out, Ranveer and Alia were getting praised everywhere
 ab film relies ho gai he
 Ranveer has taken a different level of journey from a common man to a rapper
 aalia kii acting kii bhi kaaphi tarif hui he
 But there is another actor, who is the most discussed after release
 ji haa, siddhant chaturvedi
 Siddhant mentors Ranveer in the film to rap
 unke kirdaar kaa naam he emasi sher
 He has managed to successfully capture the rapper's body language with his energy, his rap style and his swag
 yahi vajah he ki powerhouse ranvir singh ko bhi ve kai seens main pachhadte nazar aate hai
 Born in Uttar Pradesh, Siddhant is the son of a chartered accountant
 ve jab paanch saal ke the tab unka parivaar mumbai shift ho gaya tha
 Siddhant would go on to become a Chartered Accountant like his father, but winning the 2012 Mumbai National Talent Hunt proved to be his turning point
 iske baad unhone acting par hi focus karnaa shuru kar diya
 Siddhant, who appeared in a coca-cola advertisement, worked in a webseries 'life Sahi Hai' in 2016 with "love Ke Panchnama" director Luv Ranjan

 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman took part in Aaj Tak's special program 'agenda Aaj Tak'
 unhone raksha se jude mudde par bebaaki se apni raay rakhi
 The session was conducted by Rahul Kanwal
 rafel par supreme court ko gumraah karne ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki hamane jo court main affidavit diya tha usamen hamane rafel deal kii process ko spasht bataaya tha
 But there was some misinterpretation
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki hamane kuch sikret rakhaa
 We gave the Rafale process to the CAG, Parliament and PAC explaining the 'IS HAVE BEEN' wording
 lekin usamen miss-interpritesan hua
 Right now the Rafale report is with the CAG and after passing it will go to Parliament and PAC
 hamane kisi kot ko miss kot nahin kiya he
 After this mistake came to light, we went to court first and corrected that mistake
 aise galtiyaan hoti rahati hai or vakil ise sudhaarte rahete hai
 But this thing is being made big
 sarkaar kaa court ko gumraah karne kaa iraadaa nahin he
 Raised three subjects in the writ petition
 
 
 raksha mantri ne aage bataaya ki rafel mudde ko lekar supreme court main daayar rit pitishan main teen vishyon ko uthaaya gaya
 The first topic is Rafael's process, the second pricing (price) and the third is the Indian offset partner ie the choice of an Indian company
 unhone kaha ki rafel kii kharid main indian ofaset partner kaa chunaav dasolt ne kiya
 There is no role of the Government of India in this
 rafel par gumraah kar rahi he congresaraksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne aarope lagaaya ki rafel maamle par congress logon ko gumraah kar rahi he
 But it is clear in the court's decision that there is no wrongdoing in the Rafale deal
 keemat kii baat karen to vah bhi congress galat bataa rahi he
 The Congress is quoting the price of Rafael 500 million Euros, which is only on paper and saying that Modi government has bought them for 1600 million Euros
 unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki wo apane raksha mantri rahe eke antni ke saath baat karen to unhen rafel kii sahi keemat ke bare main sab samaj aa jayega
 He explained Rafael's price of 1600 million Euros, saying that it is Rafael's price with Wapen
 jo congress bataa rahi he vah keval aircraft kii base keemat he
 Therefore, comparison of Congress is completely wrong
