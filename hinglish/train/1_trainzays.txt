 chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh main tahalaka machaane ke baad ab kadakanath prajati ke murge kii bang uttar pradesh ke baharich main bhi sunai dene lagi he
 With the help of the Veterinary Department, a progressive farmer from Bahraich has called for Kadaknath's chickens and prepared chicken and chicken
 aushadhiy gun, sabase kam fat, chatkhadaar kaale rang, hameshaa yaad rahane vaale lajij swaad aadi ke liye pahachaanaa jane vaale kadakanath kaa maance, chonch, kalangi, jubaan, taangen, nakhun, chamadi sabhi kaale hote hai
 About 25 percent of the protein content is found in it
 vahiin fat 
 07 is found
 yahi vajah he ki ise aushadhiy gunon vaala murga mana jaataa he
 Kadaknath acts as a panacea for heart and diabetes patients

 As much as this species is beneficial for the non-vegetarian eaters, it is economically beneficial for the farmers who follow it, where the meat of the pre-reared traditional chicken is sold from Rs 120 to Rs 150 per kg, while Kadaknath meat is Rs 500
 Sells from kg to 1000 rupees
 kadakanath murgi kaa ek anda 50 rupee tak aasaani se bik jaataa he
 Therefore, this species has special importance and other farmers will also be benefited after it reaches Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh, because now preparations are being made to produce its chickens in Bahraich itself
 baharich ke mukhya pashu chikitsa adhikari balwant singh ne enditivi ko bataaya, 'kadakanath paalan main pradesh ke bareli zile ke baad baharich doosraa jila he jo is ore agrasaarit ho rahaa he
 This is the reason why four farmers have taken the initiative in Bahraich, they believe that Kadaknath is very good in terms of health and small farmer can also earn good profit by rearing Kadaknath in less capital

 This case of 2006 is of m Nagraj
 is faisle main adaalat neesasi / estimen naukariyon main pramotion ke dauraan krimi layer siddhant ko lagu karne ko sahi bataaya tha
 In 2018, giving a similar decision, the court said that the creamy layer rule will also apply in the reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
 justise nariman ne kaha tha, "aarakshan kii vyavastha kaa makasad nagarikon ke bich pichde virgon ko mukhyadhara main laana he jisase ve bharat ke anya nagarikon kii tarah samanta ke aadhaar par haath se haath milakar chal saken
 "the court remarked that if some rich section of one class ie the creamy layer occupies all public sector jobs and continue it, it will leave the other backward deprived of the same class as they were before
 
 adaalat ne kaha tha ki jab court essi / asti parkrimi layerka siddhant lagu karata he, to yah kisi bhi tarah se bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 341 or 342 se ched-chhaad nahin karata he
 What happens is the term creamy layer creamy layer is used according to the provisions of the Mandal Commission

 "ashok bharti kehete hai ki anusuchit jati ke paas to sampatti rakhane kaa bhi adhikaar nahin tha
 They have recently got this right
 ek or tark dete hue ashok bharti ne kaha ki obisi ke saath chuaachhut nahin hota he

 Ashok Bharti says that the 9-judge bench of the Supreme Court, formed in 1992 in the case of Indra Sawhney vs Union of India, is the largest bench on reservation in the country till date
 is bench ne kaha tha ki anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati par krimi layer kaa siddhant lagu nahin ho saktaa he
 Reviewing the verdict in the 2018 Jarnail Singh case, Ashok Bharti says that the question is, how can a five-judge bench give an observation / judgment against a nine-judge bench? Not given milk

 Some of the faces and voices of scheduled castes and tribes you are hearing are due to reservation
 unhone kaha ki anusuchit jati or janajati ko sarkaar ne abtak doodh diya nahin or kriim nikaalnaa chaahati he
 He said that if there is an attempt to implement SC / ST category in the creamy layer, they will strongly oppose the government
 SC / ST ke liye krimi layer kii sankalpana nahiprofessor ratan laal essi asti main krimi layer ke formule ko lagu karne ke khilaaf hai

 He questioned whether SC, 22 to ST

 Professor Ratan Lal said that reservation is not a poverty alleviation program, but a system of representation
 krimi layer ke samarthan main bhi kam nahin hai tarkvahin kanoon evam nyaay mantralay ke purv sachiv pike malhotra ke iske ulat tark hai
 In a conversation with Rajya Sabha TV, he said that it is the job of the government to make laws and interpret it by the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne samay-samay par samvidhan kii jo vyakhya kii he us vyakhya ke madhyam se essi / asti main krimi layer kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 PK Malhotra said that the framers of the constitution felt that the section which is socially and educationally backward should be given special rights
 isi ke tahat unhen lagbhag 70 saal tak aarakshan mila

 unhone kaha ki anek kanoon abhi bhi latake pade hai, magar aam aadmi party sarkaar is satr main ek bhi vidheyak nahin laa saki

 Also classic shows like Nukkad & Wagle Ki Duniya lokapal bill kii drafting cameti main shaamil civil sosayadi ke sadasyon ke bare main pichley do din se jari khulaason se pareshaan hokar anna hajaare ne upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko ek chitthee likhi he
 Anna has questioned the statements of Congress leaders Digvijay Singh and Kapil Sibal in his letter
 apni chitthee main anna hajaare ne likhaa he, pichley do din main jo kuch hua he, vah chintaa kaa vishay he
 It seems that the corrupt people of the country want to stop the process of drafting the bill
 congress ke ek mahasachiv baar−baar bayaan de rahe hai or mujhe lagata he ki unhen party kaa samarthan mila hua he
 Most of the statements of the Congress General Secretary are not correct
 anna ne sonia se poocha he ki kya vah unke bayanon kaa samarthan karti hai
 Anna has also questioned Kapil Sibal's statement in his letter
 anna ne likhaa he ki pehali meeting ke baad ek mantri ne bayaan diya ki meeting acchhee rahi, lekin baad main yah bhi kah diya ki civil sosayadi sarkaar ke saamne ghutane tech rahi he
 Recently, Digvijay Singh had accused Shanti Bhushan, co-chairman of the joint committee, of paying low stamp duty for buying a plot in Allahabad and called RTI activist Arvind Kejriwal, who is a disciple of Aruna Roy, on behalf of the society in the committee
 hajaare ne sanyukt samiti main samaaj kii ore se shaamil sadasyon par keechad uchhaale jane vaale bayanon par chintaa jataate hue patr main sawaal kiya, agar samiti main sarkaar kii ore se namit logon par bhi isi tarah se andeh jataayaa jaayegaa to uske kya nattejey honge? haalanki, ham vyaktigat taur par keechad uchhaalkar lokapal vidheyak se logon kaa dhyaan nahin bhatkaana chaahate
 He said, but it appears that the motive behind running such a propaganda campaign (against the members of society in the committee) is to stigmatize it
 hajaare ne kaha ki sanyukt samiti kii pehali baithak ke baad ek mantri ne apane nivas par patrakaron se nijee or anaupchaarik baatcheet main ham par yah jhootha aarope lagaaya ki ham samiti ke bheetar sarkaar ke dabaav ke aage jhuk gaye hai or hamane prastaavit kanoon ke masaude ko halkaa kar diya he
 He said, this is completely wrong, because there was no discussion about the proposed law in the committee
 hajaare ne kaha, hamen aise shararthpurna aacharan kii ashanka thi, isliye maang kii thi ki samiti kii har baithak kii video recording ho or baithak ke turant baad use jari kiya jaae
 In the letter, the Gandhian activist wrote, "we have joined the committee in the hope that the draft of strong anti-corruption bill will be prepared together
" (input bhashaa se bhi) JD-U president Sharad Yadav alleged that MNS chief Raj Thackeray is a 'puppet' of the Congress which she is using against the Shiv sena-bjp alliance for electoral gains in the state
 yadav se jab hindi samachar channelon ke khilaaf manase pramukh kii tippanee ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki raaj thakare congress kii kathputli hai or rajya main shivasena-bhaajapa gathbandhan ke khilaaf unka istemaal kar rahi he
 Raj alleged that Hindi news channels were distorting his statement
 unhone kaha ki hindi samachar channelon ko mudde ko samajhe bina khabar kaa prasaaran nahin karnaa chahie
 Yadav said that the MNS chief is of no importance and he is making such statements to incite the Marathi population there and make a dent in the Shiv Sena vote bank
 unhone kaha ki raaj thakare apane rajnatik agenda ko chalaane ke liye hindi channelon ko bhadakaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Addressing the party meeting in Mumbai, Raj said, "I want to tell the Hindi news channels that they understand the issue before broadcasting, otherwise we know to stop it
" mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii adhyakshata main sampann mantriparishad kii baithak main pradesh kii jaivik kheti ko anumodith kiya gaya
 The aim of this policy is to improve soil fertility, reduce agricultural costs and make farming profitable
 mantrimandal kii baithak ke baad sansadeey kaary mantri narottam mishra ne bataaya ki is niti ke antargat rajya jaivik mishan kaa gathan kiya jayega
 He said that an action plan will be prepared by the mission in collaboration with various departments related to agriculture
 unhone bataaya ki jaivik krishi niti main khadyann, sabji, fal, masala, van-upaj tathaa aushadhiy fasalon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Organic growing institutions will be developed and proper coordination between organic producers and the market will be ensured
 unhone kaha ki vibhinn vibhaagon kii yojanaon ko milaayaa jayega or upabhokta jaagrukta kaarykram chalaae jaaenge
 In addition, the structure and prospects for carbon trading will be developed
 jaivik khaad, jaivik kitnashak, jaivik paudh sangrakshan padaarth jaise jaivik aadaanon ko protsaahit kiya jayega
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari amidst the deadlock over forming a government in Maharashtra
 mila jankaree ke anusaar sanjay raut shaam paanch baje rajbhavan pahunche
 After this meeting, Raut said that his party was not responsible for the ongoing deadlock over government formation
 unhenne kaha ki jiske paas bhi bahumat hoga uski hi sarkaar banegi
 He said that we have spoken to the Governor about the current situation
 raut ne kaha ki rajyapal ke saath yah mulaakaat puri tarah se gaiyr-raajnneetik thi
 During this meeting, the political situation in the state was also discussed between the Governor and Raut
 unhone kaha ki hamane rajyapal ke samaksh apni baat rakhi jise unhone bahut achche se suna
 We just wanted to tell them that the government is not being formed and our party is not responsible for it
 bataa den ki rajya main vidhansabha chunaav nateezon ke baad shivasena or bijepi ke bich mukhyamantri pad ko lekar baat nahin ban paa rahi he
 The Shiv Sena wants to implement the 50-50 formula in the state
 jiske tahat dhai saal bijepi kaa or dhai saal shivasena kaa mukhyamantri rahegaa
 But BJP is not agreeing on this proposal of Shiv Sena
 maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ko lekar jari gatirodh ke bich shivasena ke varisht netaa sanjay raut ne ravivaar ko kaha tha ki unki party bhaajapa se keval mukhyamantri pad ke mudde par hi baatcheet karegaa
 There was a deadlock between the two coalition partners over the chief minister's post since the assembly election results were declared on October 24 in the state
 is chunaav main 288 sadasyeey maharashtra vidhansabha main shivasena ne 56 or bhaajapa ne 105 siton par jeet darj kii
 Raut told reporters that the deadlock was continuing
 sarkaar gathan ko lekar abhi koi baatcheet nahin hui he
 If there is talk, it will be only for the post of Chief Minister
 vahiin news agency eenai ke mutabik sanjay raut ne kaha tha ki hamaare paas 170 se zyada vidhayakon kaa samarthan he
 This figure can also be 175
 vahiin shivasena ke mukhpatr ‘saamana' ke saptahik stambh main raut ne kaha tha ki maharashtra main nai sarkaar ke gathan par raajnneetik gatirodh ‘ahankaar ke keechad main fanse ek rath' kii tarah he
 In the weekly column, he warned Raut BJP to impose President's rule in the state and said that the move would be the party's "biggest defeat of the century"
 unhone kaha tha ki yah chaunkaane vaali baat he ki ve log aisa karne kii baat kar rahe hai jo indira gandhi dwaara ghoshit apatkaal ko ‘kaale diwas' ke rup main manaate hai
 The Shiv Sena's statement came after the BJP remained firm on its stand not to share the chief minister's post and said the party's leader Sudhir Mungantiwar would move towards President's rule in the state if the new government was not formed by November 7

 He said that it cannot be endured at all, if you want to become a country of progress then you have to follow the law

 rahul gandhi kii 'ullu' tippanee par palatwaar karte hue bijepi ne aaj kaha ki matadaata vaaki ullu nahin hai or ve is loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko satta se bedakhal karne ja rahe hai
 Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley said in his blog that when voters vote against Congress, they are not owls
 paraajay saamne dekh kar ek netaa ko apni shaleenta nahin khoni chahie
 Those who are voting against the Congress will have some reason
 unhone kaha, naaraaz matadaata koi un chaar aksharon kaa shabd nahin hai jaisaa ki rahul ne unke liye chunaa he
 Rahul had yesterday said in his election rally in Kishanganj, Bihar that Modi ji, stop fooling Hindustan

 In such a situation, the NDA is the only option that has real opportunity to form a government

 com / vdqspwfihw haryana main bijepi sarkaar ke 'beti bachaao-beti padhaao' naare par ek or daag lagane vaali ghatana saamne ai he
 a similar case has occurred in Chandigarh in Fatehabad Kundu case
 isamen 11veen kaksha kii ek naaballig chaatra kaa peechha karchhedchhadkarne ke aarope main fatehabad bijepi ke yuva morcha ke adhyaksh manjit goswami or uske dost gaurav ko police ne hiraasat main liya
 According to the victim, she was being harassed after stalking her for 3 consecutive days
 shanivaar ko bhi skool se lautate hue phir se uskaa peechha kiya gaya
 After this, he took out the key of the bike as soon as both the youths on the bullet bike came near and then handed over the two youths to the police with the help of people nearby
 maukey se police donon yuvakon ko hiraasat main lekar thane le ai, lekin jab thane main donon yuvakon se poochtacha hui to ek yuvak bijepi kaa netaa niklaa
 On the other hand, the information about the BJP leader being taken into custody by the police on the charge of molesting the student reached top BJP leaders, then efforts started to save the accused BJP leader
 dopaher ko chaatra ke saath ghatana hui or satta ke dabaav main ai police ko exiaar likhane main shaam ho gai
 However, the shos came under so much pressure that they left the BJP leader Manjeet with a clean chit in the case even before the victim's statement was recorded and started the action only by writing an FIR against the BJP leader's friend Gaurav
 vahiin bataaya gaya he ki maamle main hiraasat main liye gaye ukt bijepi netaa ke sambandh haryana bijepi pradeshdhyaksh subhash baraala ke saath-saath kai cabinet mantriyo or anya bade netaaon se kaaphi achche hai
 In such a situation, under the pressure of which BJP leader the police gave a clean chit to Manjeet, only the police can tell
 peedita kaa kahana he 2 yuvak bullate bike par uskaa peechha kar use ched rahe the or donon ko usne khud bike par rokkar logon kii madad se pakadaa
 Questions are being raised over the action of such police
 sawaal yah bhi khadaa ho rahaa he ki jab maamla chaatra se chhedchhad kaa tha to mahila thana police kii madad deree se kyon lee gai? When former President APJ Abdul Kalam was brought to Bethany Hospital, there was no movement in his body

 There is a continuous increase in the group of colorful leaders in the country
 ek netaa nagar nigam ke adhikari par balla barsaata he to duusare ne do haathon main teen tamanchey or ek carbine lekar kirtiman bana daalaa
 These new leaders are BJP mlas from Uttarakhand and are showing color by waving guns on film songs
 or ab inkaa video soshal media par viral he
 In this video, a two-minute-long two-minute video, BJP MLA Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion, drinking liquor and carrying guns in his hands, is thinking of himself as Turramkhan
 inhon ne is video main aisa jalawaa dikhaaya ki andaaza bhi nahin lag paa rahaa he ki ye janata ke pratinidhi hai
 MLA Kunwar Pranav has done many adventures before
 carbine, pistal or revalvere rana ji koun hote hai sarkaar aapako maaf karne vaale
 If you are a Kunwar, then ten or twenty film Rana, if you shed your trousers, come out
 unki aukaat hi kya he
 Yes, the government has played perfectly
 aap kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 Surely nobody is like you
 dekh nahin rahe hai ek haath main carbine
 Three pistols in the second
 ye koi maamuli baat he
 Showcases of weapons
 
 Well done
 
 What style is Kunwar saheb do pistal haath main, teesraa munh main rakh liya
 Wow
 
 You should get stamped on seeing it
 style dekhie sarkaar kaa
 a leg is placed on the stool
 haathon main hathiyaar
 Glass of wine at the knees
 or bura naa maane maalik to ek baat bhi kah duun
 In the Sando vest, you swear it is Rana ji
 are yakeen naa ho to shakl mila lijie
 Look, you look like Kunwar Saheb just like Rana ji
 khanpur se vidhayakainako dekhie kunwar sahab kii mehfil main ye bhi bich bich main guest apiyarence de rahe hai
 See how much fun they are having ji
 In a similar way, you are called Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion in Uttarakhand
 aali janaab haridwar ke khanpur se bijepi ke vidhayak hai
 But instead of social service, Zanab is busy in body building and dancing
 vidhayak he yaa gangsterjanab ko dekhakar lagata hi nahin he ki ye janata ke chune numaayinde
 Their style is like a roadside
 sarkaar filmi gane par aise hathiyaaron kii numaaish kar rahe hai
 It is as if you are not an MLA and a gangster
 ye inkaa koi pehla karnama nahin he balki ye janaab aksar hi vivaadon main rahete hai
 Sir, is it birthday or Mundan? magar aap to janata ke numaayinde hai
 
 aapako ye shobhaa nahin detaa
 
 sawaal ye bhi he ki kya ye hathiyaar licency hai
 If it is so, should it be represented like this? After the video suspended from BJP went viral, all kinds of discussions are going on
 vidhayak ji ne apni is karatuut se khud kii to beizzati karai hi he
 At the same time, he has trounced the party many times
 haal main hi unhen patrakaron se badasluki kii vajah se teen maheene ke liye nilambit kiya ja chukaa he
 Champion mlas are still in suspension
 lekin majaal kya ki apni harkaton se baj aa jaaen
 After the operation, Jamai Mahfilvidyak Ji has just returned from Delhi by foot operation
 or aate hi sangeet kii mehfil aisi jamaai ki pair thirak pade
 Now that this champion of BJP has been trounced all over the world, he is now ready to apologize, but even after this clear cut video, he says that there is a conspiracy against him
 kunwar kii karatootembijapi se khanpur vidhayak kunwar pranav champion ne isse pehle 2006 main haridwar ke bahadarabad main roadways bas ke driver par sirf isliye fire kar diya tha kyonki usne unhen said nahin diya tha
 In 2010, a video of his firing at a Mangalore event went viral
 2010 main hi champion ne rudki main polaris hotel ke maalik par goli chalaa di thi
 In 2013, a bullet was fired at a dinner party at the official residence of Cabinet Minister Harak Singh Rawat
 2015 main kunwar pranav champion ne haridwar ke pathari main khanan ko lekar graminon par goliyaan daag di thi
 Now the party has been suspended for 3 months for threatening to kill the reporter of a private channel in Delhi
 lekin is baar unki museebataan zyada badi ho sakati he jahaan party unase kaaphi naaraaz hai unke is video viral hone ke baad haridwar esaspi ne maamle kaa sangyaan le liya he
 And the police has come into action
 viral video kii jaanch ho rahi he
 If the video is found to be correct in the investigation, then the arrest of Khanpur MLA of Haridwar may also happen

 com / mshwlrdriz 44 positives have been found among the 46 people caught in a rave party at a restaurant in Mumbai on May 20
 police ke anusaar rev party par pade chaape ke dauraan hiraasat main liye gaye 46 logon main se 44 logon kii maadak padaarth jaanch positive pai gai he
 Those found positive were consuming hashish and alcohol
 mumbai ke police kamishnar arup patnayak ne kaha ki 29 logon ne sharaab pi thi, jabaki 16 logon ke blad sample se saaf he ki unhone maadak padaarth or endieme kaa seven kiya tha
 Two people had only consumed NDMA
 police ke mutabik doshiyon ke khilaaf andipies act ke tahat karrwai kii jaaegi
 At the same time, the report of the cricketer Rahul Sharma present in the party is yet to come
 saamana ke jariye bijepi par tikhaa waar‘5 saal peeche hatane kii aadat daal le BJP’: saamana‘shivasena ne dhamaakedaar andaaj main bahumat jeeta’maharashtra main uddhav thakare kii aguwai main congress-ensipi-shivasena kii sarkaar kaa kaarykaal shuru ho gaya he
 The beginning of the session in the Legislative Assembly was a blast, in which the Bharatiya Janata Party imposed several obstacles in front of the Shiv Sena government
 lekin ab shivasena ne saamana ke jariye bhaajapa par phir nishaanaa saadhaa he or likhaa he ki bijepi ko agle paanch saal isi tarah peeche hatane kii aadat daal leni chahie thi
 Not only this, Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis has also got a tough fight in the face
 saamana ke jariye shivasena ne likhaa, ‘uddhav thakare ke netritv main sarkaar ne vishwasamat prastaav jeet liya he
 The majority the government got is not average but good and bang
 sarkaar ke saath 170 vidhayakon kaa bal he, ye ham pehle din se kah rahe the
 But this figure was not ready to go above 130 with the glasses of Fadnavis
 vichaaron kii udaan bharne kii kshamta nahin hogi to kaiyon ko sahyadri ‘tile’ jaisaa lagata he
 This happened in the case of majority
 ’devendra phadanis par tikhaa warasampadakeey main devendra fadanvis par nishaanaa sadhate hue likhaa gaya he, ‘170 kii sankhya dekhakar fadanvis ke netritv vaala vipaksh vidhansabha se bhaag khadaa hua
 The appointment of Nana Patole to the post of Assembly Speaker also went unopposed on Sunday
 kadaachit shanivaar ko ‘170’ kaa aankada bhaajapaavalon ke aankh or dimag main ghus jane kaa parinaam aisa hua ki vidhansabha adhyaksh pad ke chunaav main unhen peeche hatana padaa
 Now for the next 5 years they will have to make a habit of retreating like this
 ’saamana kaa sampadakiyarajya ke netritv ko lekar bijepi main sankatdavendra fadanvis par nishaanaa sadhate hue saamana main maharashtra or rajasthan kaa bhi udhaaharan diya gaya
 It wrote that 'the mistakes made by Devendra Fadnavis as Chief Minister should not be done as an opposition party leader
 vipaksh ke netaa pad kii shaan va pratishtha barkaraar rahe, aisi hamaari ichha he
 Actually, it is an internal matter of the Bharatiya Janata Party that who should make them the leader of the opposition or who else, but the BJP government did not come to Rajasthan
 vahaan purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje vipaksh kii netaa kii kursi par nahin baithi
 The BJP government of Shivraj Singh Chauhan was defeated in Madhya Pradesh, where Shivraj Singh Chauhan, considered powerful, did not become the leader of the opposition and other party leaders took this position
 jabaki maharashtra main dilliwaale ‘fadanvis hi fadanvis’ kar rahe hai iske peeche kaa vaastavik rahasy kya he yah samajhnaa hoga
 Despite not being able to go even around the majority, Delhi administered the oath of office to Fadnavis and after that government collapsed, Fadnavis was also re-appointed to the post of Leader of Opposition
 asal main maharashtra kii janata ko bhaajapa ke rajya stareey netritv main bhi badlaav chahie tha tathiskaa pratibimb matdaan main dikhaa tha
 In spite of this, the BJP leadership made the post of Leader of the Opposition, Perfadnavis, that is, it is his internal matter, we will not talk more on it
 parantu vishwasamat prastaav ke maukey par nae vipakshi netaa ne jo ‘drama’ kiya wo kuch thik nahin tha
 Taking a dig at Devendra Fadnavis, he wrote such ridiculous things that 'I am a man of rules and laws'
 lekin unhone vishwasamat prastaav ke dauraan jo sawaal khadey kiye ve kin niyamon par aadhaarit the? chhatrapati shivaray ke naam par mantriyon ne shapath vidhi main shapath lee is par fadanvis tamtamaa gaye
 The memorial of Shivarai speaks of the rules that make it illegal and 105 seats are won on it

 " Linked In is a social site
 is par rashtriya kaushal vikaas nigam ke varisht str ke adhikari ajay kumaar ne angrezi main vistaar se post likhaa he
 In this post, Ajay Kumar says that Dharmendra Pradhan abused him in front of everyone
 us tarah kii gaaliyaan jinhen yahaan likhnaa sambhav nahin hai
 Those in English are called Cuss Word
 sena main 23 saal tak afasari karne vaale ajay kumaar ne apane is saarvajanik apmaan ke bare main likhaa he
 Is the minister of the Modi government doing nationalism nationalism so much that he can cheat a senior army officer in front of everyone, and order him to be sacked? Is this exemption on the strength of such things not in newspapers It is printed
 news channelon main nahin dikhaae jate hai? jiske kaaran janata ko kabhi pataa hi nahin chalegaa ki dharmendra pradhan sena ke afasar ajay kumaar ko sabake saamne das minute tak gaaliyaan dete rahen
 The post is very long and has written about many types of activities going on within the National Skill Development Corporation
 ajay kumaar ne rashtriya kaushal vikaas nigam isliye jwine kiya kyonki ve desh ke liye kuch karnaa chaahate the
 Leaving the offer of good salary job, therefore, came to work with less salary
 ajay kumaar ko do badi zimmedaariyaan di gayi
 Examining and rating any skill centers to be opened
 doosraa jammu kashmir ke naujavaanon ke liye udaan yojana
 These two were made heads
 ghatana pichley saal kii he
 Skill India had a program at the Constitution Club in Delhi
 vahaan ajay kumaar ko nahin janaa tha magar kabina mantri dharmendra pradhan ke daftar se vahaan maujuud rahane ko kaha gaya
 When Dharmendra Pradhan asked to give recognition to one of his special skill centers, Ajay Kumar said that according to the rules of the ministry, it is not possible to give recognition to them
 aapkaa zubaani aadesh lagu nahin ho saktaa he
 Just then Dharmendra Pradhan was uprooted
 sabake saamne ajay kumaar ko gaaliyaan dene lage
 The minister had lost so much temper that he started threatening to sack him in the front
 ajay kumaar hatprabh rah gaye
 This army officer had never seen such insult
 ve khud ko sabake bich nanga mahasoos karne lage
 Ajay Kumar has written that Rajesh Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Small and Medium Industries was also present there
 rashtriya kaushal vikaas nigam ke prabandhan nideshak manish kumaar bhi the
 Nobody said anything
 ajay kumaar ne tab mantri ko kaha ki aap apane shabdon par dhyaan den
 On saying this, Dharmendra Pradhan became more enraged and started abusing
 prabandhan nideshak ko nirdesh diya ki inaki barkhaastagi par agali subah puri report dijie
 This army officer kept abusing the guests who came there
 apmaan sahataa rahaa magar mantri kii dhauns ke aage sab chup rahe
 Not only this, there were threats from the legal team to resign
 unke parivaar ko dekh lene kii dhamkiyaan
 i am telling all this written by Ajay Kumar
 baad main pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas nigam ke prabandh nideshak ne ajay kumaar ko bulaayaa or kaha ki istipha dena hoga
 Ajay Kumar wrote his resignation
 31 july 2018 ko unki seva samaapt ho gai
 He has mentioned the skills development skills in his long post
 ajay kumaar ne 9 maheene baad public main post likhaa he
 The reason for this is that after leaving Skill India, he got offers for four jobs
 har jagah unhone chhodane kaa sahi kaaran bataaya ki mantri ne gaali di or jabaran istipha liya
 Hearing this, those companies did not dare to give jobs
 ve apana prastaav lekar chanpat ho gayi
 Ajay's friends explained that tell some lies
 tab ajay se rahaa nahin gaya auki unhone public main yah post likh diya he
 Dharmendra Pradhan should answer this
 unki party kii raajnneeti ke anusaar sena ke afasar to jhooth nahin bolenge
 The military never lies
 jo sena kahati he usee par bharosa karnaa chahie
 So should the public trust that a minister of Prime Minister Modi abuses his officers in connection with the work of the ministry? Ajay Kumar should also be seen after the article
 jab gaaliyaan di ja rahi thim tab vahaan maujuud rajesh agarwal or manish kumaar ko bhi dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie jinhone ajay kumaar kaa saath nahin diya
 Such weak officers in the system are only for themselves
 sarkari gaadi or kursi kii dhamak rishtedaaron main dikhaate hai
 But sometimes when you get a chance, you are not able to stand up
 ajay kumaar kaa post padhane ke liye CLICK karen

 Police has arrested 3 minor students in the case of death of a student inside the school premises in Delhi
 police ne skool main lage CCTV footage ke aadhaar par teenon chaatro ko giraftaar kiya he
 However, one of the four students who were seen assaulting Tushar in the footage is still absconding
 police ke mutabik, sisitivi footage main saaf dikh rahaa he ki chaar chaatra tushaar ke saath marpet kar rahe hai
 DCP Ajit Singhala said that during interrogation, the accused students admitted that they had a quarrel with Tushar in the morning
 police ke mutabik, chaatro ke bich dadagiri ko lekar yah jhagada hua tha
 In fact, the accused students were fighting with someone else earlier, when 15-year-old Tushar, studying in 9th, challenged them in the middle and said he should show them fighting
 iske baad haalanki jhagada ruk gaya
 But when Tushar went to the bathroom in the middle of the period, behind the scenes, the accused students also reached the bathroom and beat Tushar fiercely there
 skool prabandhan ke mutabik, guuruuvaar ko dopaher kareeb 11
 Tushar was found unconscious in the bathroom at 30 pm
 use ultiyaan bhi huin
 The school management informed Tusshar's family members and Tushar was fainted first to the nearest hospital, from where he was referred to GTB Hospital
 haalanki tushaar ko jab jitibi hospital lekar pahunchaa gaya to doctoron ne pahunchate hi use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 But the family members alleged that the school management misinformed them that Tushar was found unconscious in the bathroom, while Tushar had died inside the school
 tushaar kii maa kaa kahana he ki unke bete kii hatya kii gai he
 Tusshar's mother said that we need justice
 police ke mutabik, maamle main ab tak koi bhi chashmadid gavaah nahin mil sakaa he or police ab chauthe aaropee chaatr kii talash kar rahi he
 Angry relatives of Tushar's death surrounded the school and protested fiercely
 lekin is ghatana ne ekbar phir skulon membecchon kii suraksha par sawalkhade kar die hai
 The question is also why the principal initially said that the child was ill and death due to illness
 philhal police kaa kahana he ki agar jaanch main skool kii laaparvaahee saamne aegi to unpar bhi karwaai kii jaaegi
 But the question is how did it start and why? In fact, last Saturday, Nepal and especially Kathmandu reached the Indian media team first and whether it was news or visuals, the Indian media left no stone unturned for the first 48 hours
 yahaan tak ki nepal sarkaar ke adhikari yaa raahat team ke log jahaan bhi pahunche, chaahe sindhupalchok ho yaa gorkha yaa pokhara, bhartiya khabariyaa channel ke patrkaar vahaan se live reporting kar rahe the
 But in our country, what is called foreign media or Western countries media not only reached Kathmandu late, but the focus of most people was Everest Base Camp
 jahaan pahunchane ke liye wo sabko muh maanga mulya dene ke liye taiyaar the, lekin yahaan par bhi ek bhartiya channel ne baaji maar lee
 Actually, this website's news channel with a team of Indian Army had a joint campaign and the team's producers Aamir and camera man Rakesh Solanki and Sanjay Agarwal not only captured the entire earthquake and avalanche on their camera, but on Monday evening, they were in Kathmandu
 Have also come
 jahaan se unki footage kaa puure vishwa main live telecast hua, jo nishchit rup se videshon ke kai media house ke liye bada jhatka tha
 But it was a matter of competition
 
 
 nepal ke adhikari is baat ko lekar naaraaz the ki bharat ne apane logon ko nikaalane ke chakkar main 48 ghante tak tribhuvan airport ko vyast rakhaa, jisase duusare deshon se sahaayta yaa kahiye raahat saamagree nahin pahunchaa pai
 The Indian media too focused on the remaining work of the Indian Army and the NDRF, but it is also true that in the early days relief work of other countries in Kathmandu or in the outskirts did not catch up and the Indian media's Nepali army The coverage of Bachaab work was not as high as that of the Indian Army
 duusari baat nepali media ke log kah rahe hai ki bhartiya media ne pakistan dwaara bif masala ko itnaa zyada tool kyon diya, jabaki do din pehle kathmandu se sate patan aspataal main jab bible kii copy banti ja rahi thi, tab logon ne manaa bhi kiya, lekin bhartiya media ne ise kabhi mudda nahin banaaya
 Whenever something happened in Nepal, such as in the days following the hijacking of the Indian Airline 814 in 1999, there was tremendous outrage against the Indian media
 us samay kii sarkaar kaa hameshaa ronaa hota tha ki bhartiya channel ke log unase madad lekar unke khilaaf hi dikhaate hai, jisase desh kii kaaphi badanaami hoti hai
 After this, when King Virendra was shot dead along with his entire family at Narayan Hiti Palace in 2001, the Indian media reported that the person to be shot was his son Dipendra
 us samay kaaphi hai-tauba machi thi
 The comments baad main nepal sarkaar kii jaanch main bhi yahi paaya gaya ki hatyara dipendra hi tha, lekin in donon ghatnaon ke baad indian media ko kathmandu main jis tareeke se nishaanaa banaaya jaataa rahaa, uske baad indian media ne nepal main ruchi dikhaani khatm kar di or tiarapy ke khel main nepal unke liye mahatvurna nahin rahaa
 This is the reason that when the Maoist activity was at its peak, the Indian media unannouncedly expelled Nepal
 nepal ke logon or media main is baat ko lekar bhi rosh he ki bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra modi bukamp kii traasadee ke bich bharat dwaara kii gai madad ke liye soshal media or khaskar twitor par vaahvahee bator rahe hai

 Officials in Nepal were angry that India kept the Tribhuvan Airport busy for 48 hours in the process of evacuating its people, so that it could not deliver aid or say relief material from other countries
 indian media ne bhi bhartiya sena or andiaref ke bachaab kaary par puraa dhyaan kendrit rakhaa, lekin ye bhi sach he ki shuru ke dinon main kathmandu main yaa bahari ilaakon main duusare deshon ke raahat kaary teji nahin pakad paae the or indian media kaa nepali sena ke bachaab kaary kaa kawarej us str kaa nahin tha, jitna bhartiya sena kaa
 Secondly, the Nepali media people are saying why the Indian media inflicted so much of the beef masala by Pakistan, while two days ago when the copy of the Bible was being distributed in Patan Hospital adjacent to Kathmandu, people also refused, But the Indian media never made it an issue
 nepal main jab bhi kuch hua jaise 1999 main indian airline 814 ke apharan ke baad ke dinon main indian media ke khilaaf jabardast aakrosh dikhaa
 There was always a cry of the government of that time that the people of the Indian channel take help from them and show them against them, which brings a lot of disrepute to the country
 iske baad jab 2001 main narayan hiti pales main raja virendra kii unke puure parivaar sahit goli markar hatya kar di gai, tab indian media ne ye reporting kii ki goli maarane vaala shaks unka betaa dipendra tha
 There was a lot of anger at that time
 tippaniyan Later in the Nepal government's investigation, it was also found that the killer was Dipendra, but after these two incidents, the way the Indian media was targeted in Kathmandu, after that the Indian media stopped showing interest in Nepal and TRP Nepal was not important to him in the game of
 yahi kaaran hai ki maovadi gatividhi jab charam par thi, tab bhartiya media ne nepal kaa aghoshit rup se bahiskaar kiya
 There is also anger among the people and media of Nepal that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is applauding social media and especially Twitter for the help rendered by India in the midst of the earthquake tragedy
 duusari baat nepali media ke log kah rahe hai ki bhartiya media ne pakistan dwaara bif masala ko itnaa zyada tool kyon diya, jabaki do din pehle kathmandu se sate patan aspataal main jab bible kii copy banti ja rahi thi, tab logon ne manaa bhi kiya, lekin bhartiya media ne ise kabhi mudda nahin banaaya

 About 10 days ago, a 13-year-old Jain girl died in Hyderabad after the end of her fast for more than two months
 is ghatana ko lekar jain samudaay kaa kahana he ki aisa kuch bhi nahin he ki ladki ke abhibhavakon ko kshamaa maangane kii jarurat pade
 Aradhana Samadia died of a heart attack two days after finishing her 68-day fast
 isane jain samudaay main upwas kii parampara kii taraf ek baar phir logon kaa dhyaan khinchaa he
 a case of culpable homicide has been registered against his parents and Jain leaders say that the incident is being manipulated through meaningless debate
 unka kahana he ki aradhana upwas ke dauraan sirf pani grahan kar rahi thi or vah bhi din main sirf do baar
 Her parents did not ask her to do so
 aradhana ke pita lakshmichand samadadiya ne enditivi se unki beti ke upwas ke 35 wein din baat kii thi or phir 51 wein din bhi unhone bataaya ki unhone apni beti se upwas todane ke liye kaha, lekin vah nahin maani
 He had told that Aradhana has been very religious since the age of five and for the last two years she was taking training for such a marathon fast
 uske chachaa ne bataaya, subah vah sabase pehle jaagti thi or sabase pehle puja paath karti thi
 They said, it is futile for him to grieve, because he has attained salvation
 vah jivan-mrityu ke chakra se chhot gai he or yah sab usne sirf 13 saal kii umr main paa liya
 He told the Hyderabad police that fasting is a kind of austerity that is necessary according to his religious custom
 yah jaruri nahin he ki bade bachche hi yah karen
 Anybody who does penance is celebrated as a festival
 yah pramanit karne ke liye ki na to aradhana ne or na hi uske parijanon ne koi tay rivaaj se hatakar kaam kiya, police ko soshal media se ekatrit photo or naam bataae gaye : ahmedabad main 2013 main jain sant ke sammaan main chah saal ke bachche ne aradhana ke baraabar hi lanbaa upwas kiya tha; ahmedabad main hi agast main chah saal ke bhai or nau saal kii bahan ne 75 din kaa upwas kiya tha
 a six-year-old brother of Ahmedabad and a nine-year-old sister who fasted for 75 days
 hyderabad ke pratishthit jain guru rabindra munijee kaa kahana he ki "upwas karne main sakasham logon main iske anubhav ke saath aatmavishvaas aata he or phir ve khud upwas ke liye prerit hote hai
 Muniji is planning austerities and rituals regarding youth
 unka daawa he ki "upwas karne waalon main ek se do fisadi bachche hote hai, jo upwas ke pehle or baad main bhi swasth hote hai
 "to those who decided to avoid food and water, he added that" this is to find physical capacity
 ''tippaniyan Child rights activists say that it is absurd not only to endanger the lives of children, but to take out their emotional procession (the worship was taken out in a chariot) upon succeeding in the alleged ordeal
 hyderabad main alpsankhyak ayog ke pramukh aabid rasul khan ne kaha ki "yahaan mudda bacchon kii suraksha kaa he
 The community and senior people should be aware of this
 " Sources say that the police is proceeding with caution in this case
 ab tak koi giraftaar nahin kii gai he kyonki yahaan maamle bal adhikaron or dharmik paramparaon ke nirvaah ke hai
 Both these issues are sensitive
 68 din kaa upwas khatm karne ke do din baad hi aradhana samadadiya kii dil kaa daura padane se maut ho gai
 This has once again drawn the attention of the people towards the tradition of fasting in the Jain community
 uske mata-pita ke khilaaf gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa maamla darj kiya gaya he or jain netaaon kaa kahana he ki is ghatana ko bemaani bahes ke jariye tod-marodakar pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 He says that Aradhana was consuming water only during the fast and that too only twice a day
 uske mata-pita ne use aisa karne ke liye nahin kaha tha
 Aradhana's father Lakshmichand Samadadia spoke to NDTV on the 35th day of his daughter's fast and then on the 51st he told that he asked his daughter to break the fast, but she did not listen
 unhone bataaya tha ki aradhana paanch saal kii umr se hi kaaphi dharmik pravriti kii hai or pichley do saal se vah aise marathon upwas se liye training le rahi thi
 Her uncle told, in the morning she used to wake up first and recite pooja first
 unhone kaha, uske liye shok karnaa vyarth he, kyonki usne moksh paa liya he
 She has missed the cycle of life-death and achieved all this at just 13 years of age
 unhone hyderabad police ko bataaya ki upwas ek tarah kii tapasya he jo ki uske dharmik rivaaj ke mutabik jaruri he

 udupi rajagopalacharya ananthamurti ne loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle yah kah kar sansani failaa di thi ki agar narendra modi pradhanmantri ban gaye, to main bharat main rahanaa pasand nahin karuunga
 As a result, when he died of cardiac arrest on the evening of 22 August, some of his haters began to celebrate
 is aarope main mangalore or chikmagalore main bhartiya janata party or hindu jaagran vedike ke kai kaaryakartaaon ko giraftaar bhi kiya gaya
 His death was also expressed on Facebook
 lekin in logon ko abhas tak nahin tha ki ananthamurti bhi hindu hi the-ek khaas tarah kaa, apni parampara ko samajhane kii koshish karne vaala, usase lagaataar jirah karne vaala hindu, jo bhartiyata or aadhuniktaa, donon kaa vilakshan pakshdhar tha
 The news was suppressed that when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, Ananthamurthy said - Where else can i go - India is my home; Because, it was the voice of a defeated person, causing no excitement
 par vastav main unke donon hi vaktavy, ek myne main, samaan rup se sahi the
 One thing was said in the idiom and the other in the language of faith
 magar jo muhaavarey main kaha gaya tha, uske peeche bhi kuch or nahin, aasthaa hi thi
 This was the power of Ananthamurthy - even though he lived in the "bhadra" environment of English, he had no desire to cut from his roots
 ve duchithta bhi nahin the ki angreji main angreji waalon ke ho jaaen or kannada main kannada waalon ke
 His English was also, in fact, an extension of his Kannada
 fanishwarnath shrenu ke baad you
 R
 ananthamurti shaayad duusare bhartiya kathakaar hai jinhone hindu samaaj main jati kii kendriyata ko itani tivrata se pahachaanaa tha
 When he appeared on the Kannada literature horizon with his novel Sanskar in 1965, there was a blast
 lekhak swayan brahman tha or brahman samaaj ke paakhand ko badi talkhi ke saath ujagar kar rahaa tha
 It was a social phenomenon along with literature
 isi se kannada sahitya main ‘‘navya’’ andolan kii shuruyaat maani jaati he, jisane kannada lekhakon ke do varg bana die
 One section of traditionalist writers like Bhairappa who, while presenting a large social circle, did not want to witness the intersections emerging in Indian society and another like writers like Ananthamurthy with new and progressive values
 ananthamurti ke vyaktitv main ek vibhaajan ghatit ho saktaa tha
 He did his phd from Birmingham University, UK and returned to India to become a professor of English
 baad main ve kai bhartiya or videshi vishvavidhyalayon ke visiting professor bhi hue
 But he continued to write in Kannada
 kaayda yah ho chukaa he ki professor aalochak ho jaataa he or lekhakon ke liye academik jagat main koi khaas jagah nahin hoti
 As if there is an inevitable duality between intellectualism and creativity
 ananthamurti ne is dwait ko todaa or is baat kaa pramaan bhi ban gaye ki ise todgaye kaa adarsh tarika kya ho saktaa he
 Ananturti is remembered as a "public intellectual", as he also had a public life
 kah sakate hai ki ve apane samay ke yatharth main puri tarah dhanse hue the
 His creativity was not integrated into his intellectual and writing work, so he also fought Bangalore for Bangalore and also contested Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha elections
 kannada samaaj main unki haisiyat ek sammanit bujurg jaisi thi, jisase kisi bhi vishay par paraamarsh liya ja saktaa he
 For India, he was like a sage
 unhone bade-bade pad sanbhale
 From 1987 to 1991, he was the Chancellor of Mahatma Gandhi University in Kerala
 1992 main neshnal book trust ke adhyaksh banaae gaye
 The following year he was elected president of the Sahitya Akademi of Delhi
 do baar pune sthit film or televijan institute ke chairman bane
 In 2012, he was appointed Chancellor of Central University of Karnataka
 ve jahaan bhi rahe, loktantric paddati se kaam kiya or apane bare main kam, sanstha ke bare main zyada sochaa
 While living in the establishment, he was not an establishmentist
 academy ke samvidhan ke anusaar uskaa adhyaksh ek nirvaachak mandal dwaara chunaa jaataa he
 The government wanted to end this autonomy
 usne prastaav rakhaa ki jis tarah vishvavidhyalayon ke kulapati chune jate hai, usee tarah sahitya academy kaa adhyaksh chunane ke liye ek khoj samiti banaai jaae
 Ananthamurthy rejected the proposal and saved the autocracy of the litterateurs
 unhone yah parampara bhi banaai ki academy ke puraskaar uske adhyaksh yaa kisi lekhak ke haath se die jaaen-mantriyon ko yah ksht na diya jaae
 Ananthamurthy lived a contented life, with his novels, story collections, poetry collections, criticism books and conceptual writing, translations into Indian and foreign languages, participation in national and international symposiums, many awards including Jnanpith Was a contributor to the socialist movement, was a literary and political friend, and had a happy family life
 mrityu ke pehle ve nae upanyaas kaa praaroop bana rahe the
 i believe that his last breath must have been full of satisfaction of living a holistic and good life

 There are many mysteries in the world that have been unresolved for centuries
 antarctic ek aisa mahadweep jo puri tarah se barf se ghira hua hai
 The temperature here is always in minus
 vaise to antarctic main bahut se barf ke glacier hai lekin ek aisa rahasyamay glacier bhi he jisase laal rang kaa pani nikalataa he
 Hence it was called Blood False, whose name is Taylor Glacier
 east antarctic main victoria land ke mecmurdo dry vailij main west lake bonni main barf se dhaki sataha par tailor glacier sthit hai
 This glacier is a very unique glacier
 laal rang ke pani ke kaaran ise khun se jodakar glacier ko blad falls bhi kaha jaataa he
 This has been a mystery for the last 106 years
 lekin, aakhirkaar vaigyaniko ne glacier se nikalate hue laal pani ke peeche kaa rahasy sabake saamne laa diya
 Jessica Bargeleigh, a former Colorado College graduate from the US, glacier scientist Erin Petit of the University of Alaska and her team of researchers, discovered the cause of red water in the glacier
 unhone is shodh ke liye radio iko sounding radar kaa istemaal bhi kiya
 He told that this red water is actually falling from a giant pond
 jo pichley kai saalo se is tailor glacier ke neeche dabaa hua hai
 Researchers believed that as the water freezes, they release heat
 yahi garmi barf ko chaaron taraf se garam karti he
 Due to this process, these chemical reactions are taking place
 isi vajah se glacier se laal rang kaa pani nikal rahaa he
 This research was proved in 2017
 pehle bataae jate the ye karanis glacier kii khoj 1911 main australia ke jiyologist thomas grifffith tailor ne kii thi
 Griffith Taylor then started researching it
 unki shodh ke anusaar laal rang ke pani kii vajah laal rang kaa shaiwal tha jo glacier kii upree parat par jam gaya tha
 This caused the color of the water flowing from the glacier to become red
 kuch logon ne is research ko sahi maan liya tha
 Griffith Taylor was unable to prove his research theory, which caused his theory to fail
 iske baad 2003 main ai shodhakartaaon kii team ne is glacier ke pani ko lekar dobaaraa shodh shuru kar di thi
 According to their research, the reason was stated that due to the high amount of iron salt in the water, the color of the water melting from the glacier has turned red
 ye research kuch pratishat thik thi lekin ye iskaa asli kaaran nahin tha

 com / 5wpwbvgpsn muthuwel karunanidhi, pichley 50 saalon main tamilnadu kii maujuuda raajnneeti kaa sabase bada naam jo 94 baras kii umr main bhi sakriy rahaa
 Karunanidhi's entry into politics was through the Dravidian movement and from here he created an identity that remained intact till today and it was extremely difficult for the opposition to challenge him
 dravid andolan kii shuruyaat dharmik vishwaason, brahmanvaadi soch or hindu kuritiyon par prahaar karne ke liye hui thi
 The father of the Dravidian movement is considered to be the great social reformer of Tamil Nadu, EVK Ramaswamy 'periyar'
 unhone aaajeevan brahmanvaadi soch or hindu kuritiyon par jamkar prahaar kiya
 Even lit Hindu scriptures like Manusmriti
 diemke (dravid munetra kadgam)ne tamilnadu main dravid andolan ke jariye periyar ke vichaar ko apanaaya or raajnneeti main apni jagah banaai
 Periyar formed the Dravida Kadagam in 1944, but in 1949 CN Annadurai, very close to Periyar, had differences with him
 annadurai ne 17 sitambar, 1949 main dravid munetra kadgam (diemke) kii sthapana kii
 Periyar was demanding an independent Dravid country, whereas Annadure was demanding a separate state and wanted to enter politics, unlike Periyar
 annadurai ne jab diemke kii sthapana kii tabakarunanidhiunke saath nahin aae
 Karunanidhi was a firm supporter of social reformist Periyar
 varsh 1969 main sien annadurai ke nidhan ke baad karunanidhi ne diemke kii kaman sanbhali or 50 saalon tak uske mukhiya bane rahe
 Now his son MK Stalin is commanded by this party
 kattar hindootv ke khilaaf dravid andolan menkarunanidhine bad-chadhakar hissaa liya or rajyabar main iske pratik banate chale gaye
 Also strongly opposed the Hindi language
 mahaj 14 saal kii umr main unhone hindi-virdohi kii takhti lekar raajnneeti main pravesh kiya tha
 In 1937, a large number of youth protested against making Hindi compulsory in schools, Karunanidhi was also one of them
 iske baad unhone tamil bhashaa ko apana hathiyaar banaaya or tamil main hi naatak, akhbaar or filmon ke liye script likhane lage
 Meanwhile, he also formed a student organization associated with Dravidian politics
 phir 1965 main hindi ko desh kii ekmaatr sarkari bhashaa banaae jane ke elaan ke virodh main tamilnadu main hindi ke khilaaf andolan shuru ho gaya, jiskaa karunanidhi ne netritv kiya or kamyaabi hasil kii
 During the statewide protests against Hindi, Karunanidhi and his supporters erased the Hindi name from the railway station and they lay down on the tracks to block the train route
 is hinsak virodh pradarshan main do logon kii jaan bhi chali gai, or karunanidhi giraftaar kar liye gaye
 From here he moved forward as a big leader
 1957 main karunanidhi pehali baar tamilnadu vidhansabha ke vidhayak bane or 1967 main ve satta main aae or unhen lok nirmaan mantri banaaya gaya
 Became Chief Minister of the state for the first time after the death of Annadurai in 1969
 vishwa ke sambhavat: sabase vaanchit aatankwaadi osama bin-laden kii maut ke baad america videsh mantri hillari clinton ne kaha ki uski maut ke baad aatankwaad ke khilaaf yuddh abhi khatm nahin hua he
 In addition, he asked the Taliban to separate themselves from al-qaeda and participate in a peaceful political process
 osama kii maut ko ‘mile kaa pathar’ bataate hue hillari ne kaha, ‘taliban ke liye hamaara sandesh ab bhi vahi he or aaj isaki gunj or zyada vyapak ho gai he
 You (taliban) cannot defeat us nor make us wait any longer
 lekin tum al-kaayda kaa saath chhodkar shantipurna raajnneetik prakriya main shaamil hone kaa rasta chun sakate ho
 He said that the struggle against the terrorist organization will continue and the US will continue to cooperate with the international community including Pakistan
 centre kii doosraa pradesh punargathan ayog banane or andhra pradesh main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii koi yojana nahin he
 Union Law Minister m Veerappa Moily said on Saturday, "there is no proposal to create a second State Reorganization Commission in front of the Center
 ’’moili pradesh main telugana ko lekar hui hinsa par prashnon kaa jawaab de rahe the
 He said, "the Center and the state are making every effort to resolve the Telangana issue
" ’’moili ne andhra pradesh main raashtrapati shashan lagu karne kii sambhaavna ko bhi nakaar diya
 He said, "there is an elected government in the state, which is capable of handling all matters
" ’’ PM Modi has invited the heads of all the parties who have members in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha on June 19
 is baithak main 'ek raashtra, ek chunaav' ke vichaar, 2022 main aazaadee ke 75wein varsh ke jashn, mahatma gandhi ke is saal 150wein jayanti varsh ko manaane samet kai maamalon par charchaa kii jaaegi
 After this, on 20 June, all mps will meet at dinner time
 mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) ne patr main likhaa, 'ek raashtra, ek chunaav' jaise samvedansheel evam gambhir vishay par itane kam samay main jawaab dene se is vishay ke saath nyaay nahin hoga
 This topic requires consultation with constitutional experts, electoral experts and party members
 ' unhone likhaa, 'main anurodh karuungi ki is maamle par jaldbaaji main kadam uthaane ke bajaae, aap kripaya sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko is vishay par ek shwet patr bhejein, jisamen unase apane vichaar vyakt karne ko kaha jaae
 They should be given enough time for this
 yadi aap aisa karte hai, tabhi ham is mahatvapurn vishay par thos suzav de paaenge
 Mamata Banerjee further said that on the issue of development of backward districts, the Trinamool Congress has already conveyed its views to them that they are not in support of the selection of some districts, because it balanced all the districts of the state And the overall goal of equal development will not be met
 unhone kaha, 'hamaara rajya sabhi jilon ke samaan saamaajik evam aarthik vikaas sunishchit karne ke liye patibaddh he taaki kshetreey asantulan paidaa nahin ho
 Mamata Banerjee also said that she and her party would be participating in celebrations to mark 75 years of independence in 2022 and 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi, but the lower house is a matter of ways to improve the productivity of Parliament And the Ministry concerned should deal with it

 chhattisgarh main chunaav kareeb aate hi sarkari yojanaon kii pole bhi khulne lagi he
 Under a government scheme, the state's BJP government had purchased bicycles in lakhs of rupees for free distribution to laborers and the needy
 kai jilon main cycle vitarit bhi hui, lekin kai jile aaj bhi aise hai, jahaan godaamon main pade-pade hajaaron cycilen kabad main tabdeel ho gayi
 One such warehouse was revealed in Jashpur where four thousand two hundred bicycles have become junk
 maamle ke khulaase ke baad sarkaar ne jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 Bicycles kept in this warehouse located in the livelihood college campus of Chhattisgarh's tribal dominated Jashpur district are turning into garbage day by day
 ek nami giraami company kii is jile ke liye saat hajaar aath sau cycilen kharidi gayi thi, taaki jaruratmandon ko inhe muhaiyaa karaayaa ja sake, lekin inamen se maatr 3600 cycilen hi banti ja sakin
 The remaining 4 thousand 200 bicycles are kept here in unclaimed condition
 in cykilon ko mazdooron or jaruratmandon ko muhaiyaa karaane kii javabdehi rajya ke shram vibhaag kii thi, lekin shram vibhaag ke afasaron ne iske vitaran main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 a year ago, he distributed 3600 bicycles
 uske baad palat kar apane is godaam kaa rukh tak nahin kiya
 As a result, thousands of bicycles were turned into junk
 saikadon cykilon main jang lag gaya
 When asked about this, the officers of the labor department got involved in a daub
 udhar maamle ke khulaase ke baad congress ne rajya kii bijepi sarkaar par sarkari dhan kii barbaadi or yojanaon ke kriyanvayan main laaparvaahee kaa aarope lagaaya he
 According to Congress spokesperson Shailesh Nitin Trivedi, the BJP had devised this scheme to gain cheap popularity, so the officials did not implement it seriously
 natijatan karodon kaa chuunaa sarkari tijori ko laga
 Here, government spokesperson and MLA Srichand Sundrani said that after the matter came to light, instructions for investigation have been given
 unhone daawa kiya ki laaparvaahee baratane vaale afasaron ke khilaaf kadi karrwai hogi
 This is the situation of cycle distribution scheme not only in Jashpur in Chhattisgarh but in other districts of the state
 rajya sarkaar ne mazdooron or jaruratmand logon ke alaava schuli bacchon tak ko muft cycle vitarit karne kii saraswati cycle yojana ko jor-shor se lagu kiya tha
 In each district, the Labor Department was entrusted with the Tribal Welfare Department and the responsibility of its distribution
 ye cycilen kisi agency ke munaafe se bachane ke liye sidhe companiyon se kharidi gai thim
 No agency or middlemen were involved in the purchase of bicycles
 taaki sarkaar ko bazaar bhav se kam keemat par cycilen uplabdh ho saken
 But in this way the destruction of bicycles lying in the godowns again shattered the government's intention
 cycle vitaran yojana ke bure haal ko lekar congress ne bijepi sarkaar par sarkari dhan kii barbaadi kaa aarope lagaaya he
 On the other hand, after the case of wastage of bicycles in the government warehouse, the government has taken the officers in the face
 sarkaar ne pratham drushtya ise afasaron kii laaparvaahee qaraar diya he or maamle kii jaanch ke nirdesh bhi die hai
 Bicycles are still preferred in Chhattisgarh
 adivasee ilaaka ho yaa phir aam gramin ilaaka, logon kii pehali pasand aaj bhi cycle hi he
 Therefore, the government prepared a cycle distribution scheme for the toiling laborers and school children and also implemented it vigorously
 lekin ab afasarshahi in yojanaon par baari pad rahi he
 On Monday, a new twist took place in the politics of Maharashtra
 shivasena supremoudhav thakrene maharashtra vidhansabha sachiv ko patr likhakar netaa vipaksh kaa pad maanga he
 With this letter, it has been decided that Kishivasena will play the role of opposition in Maharashtra Sadan
 shivasena chif uddhav thakare ne vidhansabha sachiv ko patr likhakar netaa vipaksh kaa pad maanga he
 At the same time, Eknath Shinde will be the leader of Shiv Sena in the House
 jaahir he shivasena ke is patr ne saaf kar diya he ki shivasena,bijepi nit maharashtra sarkarmen shaamil nahin hogi or donon partiyon ke bichpunarmilan kii atakalon parab viraam lag gaya he
 Earlier on Sunday, after the expansion of the central cabinet, Shiva Sivasane had mentioned in a press conference and sitting in the opposition
 shivasena vidhayak dal kii baithak ke baad party pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha tha ki agar bijepi pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se sharad pavaar kii party ensipi se haath milaati he, to shivasena vipaksh main baithegi
 However, Shiv Sena's stance has become clear with Uddhav's letter on Monday evening
 haalanki uddhav ne aakhri faisle ke liye do din kaa intjaar karne kii baat kahi thi
 He said, 'we want a stable government in the state
 hindutvvaadi partiyon kaa ek saath rahanaa desh ke hit main he, lekin sharad pavaar hi vah shaks hai jinhone bhagava aatankwaad jaisaa shabd diya tha
 Even then if the BJP wants to go with them, go
 shivasena kattar or prakhar hindutvvaadi party he
 She will not leave the issue of Hindutva and will sit in opposition in such a situation
 ''hamane faisla le liya he, vipaksh kaa netaa hamaara hoga'vidhansabha sachiv ko patr likhane ke baad uddhav thakare ne kaha ki rajnatik pradurbhaav kaa upaay hamaare paas hai
 No one should worry about that machhar kaatane se dengue hota he ye to pataa he lekin aaj kal raajnneeti main kone kisko kaat rahaa he, ye samaj nahin aa rahaa
 Targeting BJP and Sharad Pawar, Uddhav said, 'there is a difference between mosquito bytes and baits
 pehle ke machhar aate the or chale jate the, lekin aaj ke machharon kaa pradurbhaav bad rahaa he
 Significantly, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar said in a statement on Monday that mosquito bites in Maharashtra cause dengue
 uddhav ne kaha ki mahanagar palika par unki najar he, to unki najar kaa kya karnaa he wo dekh lenge
 But saffron is to be hoisted on the metropolitan municipality
 bijepi par kataaksh karte hue uddhav ne kaha ki mumbai par jab bhi sankat aayaa he sabase pehle shivasainik hi madad ke liye raaston par utre he
 Dengue mosquitoes belong to the upper classes
 sirf saaf pani main hote hai
 They have to be cleaned
 unhone kaha, 'bhagava aatankwaad, aadhi chaddivaale log or ishrat jahaan ko nirparaadh qaraar dene waalon kaa bijepi samarthan legi, to bilkul le
 We have claimed the post of Leader of the Opposition
 charchaa jari rahegi, lekin hamane faisla le liya he
 Our leader will be the leader of the opposition
