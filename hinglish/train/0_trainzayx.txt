 Undergoing punishment, underworld don Chhota Rajan, Bihar's Bahubali Shahabuddin, Delhi's dangerous criminal Neeraj Babania are among many dangerous prisoners

 Bowlers have performed better in odis than in Tests, with Stuart Binny 4 in 3 odis

 Dhoni has also prepared his action plan by trying every bowler he has
 gendbaazi ke morche par australian vikaton par dhoni kii kya ranneeti hogi ye unke dimag main saaf he
 Dhoni says, "we cannot play with three fast bowlers and two spinners, this makes our batting very weak, if two wickets fall quickly then there is a lot of pressure on the rest of the batsmen
 ' That is, Team India will hit the ground with two fast bowlers, two spinners and an all-rounder
 haalanki do tej gendbaaz koun honge, iskaa chunaav aasaan nahin hoga
 At present, Akshar and Ashwin are seen to be playing a lot, because they can also prove useful with the bat
 dhoni ne kaha, 'hamane apni ballebaazi ko majboot karnaa he
 Batting of tail is very important

 The population of India, which has reached the verge of mass explosion, has grown five times in the last 100 years and by 2050 it will overtake China too

 Growing at a rate of 4 percent
 jabaki china main isi avadhi ke dauraan jansankhya vruddhi dar 0

 While India's population 161 by the year 2050
 38 karod or china kii keval 141
 7 crores will remain
 is tarah bharat jansankhya ke maamle main china ko peeche chhod degaa
 The funny thing in this regard is that Pakistan's population rate in the Indian subcontinent is the highest 2 in the last five years
 2 pratishat dar se badi
 37 on India's population by the year 2026
 1 karod logon kaa atirikt bhaar bad jaayegaa

 Scam season has exposed new scams
 ye he ab tak kaa sabase bada zamin ghotaalaa jise bombai hai court ne mini 2-ji ghotaalaa bataa diya
 Its strings have come up all over Maharashtra and especially in Pune
 ye ghotaalaa urban land ceiling yani uelsi act 1976 ke tahat hua he
 The Bombay High Court, considering the matter as very serious, has described it as the biggest scam ever
 isamen lakhon square feet kii zamin se khilwaad hua he
 The special thing is that the poor sections of the society should have benefited from this land
 court maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunpna chaahati he
 Because it is alleged that on the basis of bogus papers, the builders-leaders and big government babus kept the land in their possession
 uelsi act ke tahat praavdhaan tha ki shahari ilaakon main 500 square meter se zyada kii zamin sarkaar adhigrahan karegaa lekin bataaya jaataa he ki sarkari adhigrahan se muawza kam miltaa isliye aise kaagazaat taiyaar karaaye gaye jisase zamin sarender karne kii naubat hi na aae
 BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari is going to apply in the case

 In the wake of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, political enthusiasts have started intensifying in Bihar
 ek taraf jahaan rashtriya raajnneeti ke lihaaj se bijepi ke saamne mahagathbandhan kaa rasta khoja ja rahaa he, vahiin bihar main kshetreey dalon ke bich bhi gotiyaan kheli ja rahi hai
 When the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party organized an iftar party on Sunday, amid speculation of a split in the NDA constituents, it did not reach its ally
 darasal, bihar main endie ke ghatak dalon ke bich asantosh kii atakalon ke bich ravivaar ko rashtriya lok samta party (ralospa) kii ore se yojit iftaar party kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 Despite the invitation, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Deputy Chief Minister and BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi and none of the LJP leaders attended the Iftar
 is ghatana ke baad rajd netatejasvi prasad yadavane ralospa pramukh evam kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha se kaha ki vah rajg chhodkar unki party ke netritv vaale gathbandhan main shaamil ho jaaen kyonki endie main unhen beete chaar saalon se 'najrandaaj' kiya gaya he
 However, Kushwaha turned down Tejashwi's invitation and insisted that he is in the NDA and is working to make Narendra Modi the Prime Minister again in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 duusari taraf dilachasp baat ye he ki ralospa ne endie ke sabhi ghatak dalon ko iftaar party kaa nyotaa bheja tha, baavjood iske bijepi ke ek do netaaon ko chhodkar koi bada netaa nahin pahunchaa
 RLSP spokesperson Abhayanand Suman said that the Iftar party invitation was sent to all the NDA constituents JDU, BJP and LJP in their offices in Bihar
 darasal, kushvaha kii iftaar party main jadyu or lojpa netaaon ke na pahunchane ke bade myne nikaalane ja rahe hai
 Till now it is discussed that unhappy with BJP, JDU, RLSP and ljpath can together contest elections in Bihar
 duusari taraf pradesh ke bijepi netaa bhi 2019 main apane dam par chunaav ladane kii maang party forum par rakh chuke hai
 In such a situation, only time will tell if the absence of Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan in rlsp's Iftar party takes place

 After the names of party founders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Dimple Yadav are being speculated that Akhilesh Yadav may contest from Azamgarh seat
 azamgarh sansadeey seat yadav or muslim bahul kshetra he or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar ke bich yahaan se purv mukhyamantri mulaayam singh yadav ne jeet hasil kii thi

 As per Mulayam's wish, the party gave him ticket from Mainpuri while Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple Yadav is going to contest from Kannauj

 In his first list, he announced 6 names

 Investigations by Aadhaar channel Headlines Today have revealed that Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra has violated rules in the sale and sale of land in Haryana and sold it again for a good price
 dilli se 30 kilometre kii duuri par basaa amipur gaanv robert wadra kaa sabase aasaan shikaar bana
 Vadra bought land here at the price of soil and sold it again after earning a profit
 amipur gaanv ke harbans lala paahwa ke saath wadra ne chaar bhoomi kaa sauda (46 acre)kiya or usee jameen ko dobaaraa paahwa ko adhik keemton main bechi
 The deal is a violation of the Land Holding Act 1972 of Haryana
 is jaanch se khulaasa hua ki kanoonee bhoomi saude kii aad main paise ko ghumaya ja rahaa tha
 Robert Vadra first purchased 12 acres of land in Faridabad's Amipur village from Harbans Lal Pahwa on 8 September 2005
 is jameen kii keemat 32 lakh rupee thi
 In April 2006, Vadra purchased 10 acres of land for 30 lakh rupees from the same
 isi varsh 30 janvari ko harbans se hi 19 acre jameen kharidi thi
 This time it was priced at Rs 54 lakh
 28 april 2006 main robert wadra kii patni priyanka gandhi ne paahwa se paanch acre jameen kaa sauda 15 lakh rupayon main kiya
 The entire deal for Vadra's 46 acres of land is in violation of the Haryana Land Acquisition Act 1972 Act
 is act ke mutabik ek parivaar yaa ek vyakti ke paas 26
 Can hold 9 acres of agricultural land
 chandigarh ke vakil anupam gupta ne spasht kiya, 'niyam se adhik jameen par malikana haq hone se vah jameen sarkaar ke paas aa jaati he
 An additional portion of the land is distributed to the poor and the needy
 ' isliye wadra kii atirikt 20 acre jameen sarkaar ke paas aa gai
 Surprisingly, the entire deal not only violated the Haryana Land Acquisition Act 1972 but also sold the land back to the same dealer
 paanch saal se kam samay main vikreta kharidaar ban jaataa he or phir kharidaar vikreta ban jaataa he
 Headlines Today spoke to former RBI director Vipin Malik, who handles high-profile tax cases
 malik kehete hai, 'aap ek vikreta se jameen kharidte hai or phir usee ko bechate hai
 In this way, this transaction continues between two people and it results in profit of crores of rupees
 paisa ek hi vyakti kaa he jo ise kharid rahaa he or jo use bech rahaa he
 This is a clear case of fake and fake transactions
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki harbans laal paahwa or robert wadra ke bich kya sambandh he? bhoomi kharid-farokht kaa yah len-dein in donon ke bich lambey samay tak chal rahaa tha
 The puzzle of Harbans Lal Pahwa was not solved yet that the special team of Headlines Today had their eye on Vadra's balance sheet
 is shit main phir paahwa ke liye 1 karod, 55 lakh rupee the
 Documents submitted by Headlines Today show that Pahwa's company 'carnival Intercontinental Estate Private Limited had given a loan of Rs 1 crore, 55 lakh to Vadra's company
 yahi nahin paahwa ko wadra kii company 'real arth' main 18 farvari 2008 se 23 march 2009 ke dauraan nideshak kaa pad mila tha
 Headlines Today tried to go to Pahwa's house in Gurgaon and talk to him but Pahwa's son Gulshan met at the house
 gulshan ne apane pita or robert wadra ke bich hui kisi bhi bhoomi saude kii jaankaree se inkaar kiya
 Even refusing to mix Pahwa as an excuse for illness

 We often hear the term brain mapping test in connection with the investigation of a crime
 brain masping test ek aisi jaanch prakriya he, jiske tahat aaropee ke mastishk kii hulchalon kii chhaviyon ke jariye uske doshi hone kaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 The brain mapping test was invented by American neurologist Dr
 Laurence A
 Farwell
 is test main abhiyukt ko computer se judaa ek helmat pahanaaya jaataa he, jisamen kai sensor or electronic upkaran lage hote hai
 During the investigation, forensic experts show the accused pictures of objects related to the crime or narrate certain sounds and observe the response of the brain of the accused to find out his suspect
 sensor mastishk kii gatividhiyon ko monitor karata he or pi 300 tarangon ko ankit karata he
 These waves arise only when the accused has some connection with those pictures and sounds
 nirdosh aaropee aparaadh se judi dhvaniyon or chitron ko pahchaan nahin pate, jabaki doshi sandigdh unhen pahchaan lete hai

 desh kii sabase oonchi adaalat main ramajnmabhumi babari masajid vivaad par dhai ghante sunwaayee chali
 However, whether outside the court, whether the parties or the common citizens are involved in the matter, it is said that this matter should be kept away from politics
 ye saaf sada or sidhe taur par jameen par malikana haq kaa maamla he
 So one is crazy and the other is emotional
 aise main siyasat isse dur hi rahe to behatar he
 But whatever happened in the court was seen far away from it
 supreme court ke chif justise kii aguwai main teen jajon kii bench jab is maamle main sunwaayee ke liye baithi to lag rahaa tha ki sunwaayee kanoonee nukton par hi hogi
 But Congress leader and senior advocate Kapil Sibal and his fellow lawyer Drs
 rajeev dhawan ne zyaadaatar daleelein raajnneetik hi deen
 Sometimes the mention of Ram temple in the NDA election manifesto, sometimes argued to postpone the hearing till the coming Lok Sabha elections i
e
 July 2019
 shiya vakf board ne kaha- hamane formula nikaala hesupreme court kii sunwaayeeshuru hui to shiya vakf board kii ore se vakil emasi dhingra ne lage haath apana rukh saaf kar diya
 He said that the Shia Waqf Board has drawn a formula to resolve this issue through the court or outside
 uskaa khaakaa ye he ki janmabhumi par ram mandir ban jaae or lakhanu yaa faijabad main masjid aman kii tamir kar di jaae
 But the court did not give up the argument by saying that these things will happen later, first the outline of the hearing should be decided
 iske baad morcha sambhala mukhya teen pakshakaron main se ek or is maamle main elahabaad hoicourt ke faisle ko chunauti dene supreme court aae upi sunni central vakf board ke vakil kapil sibbal ne
 Sibal first argued that the UP government should not give the translated document
 iske baad sidhe sidhe siyaasi mudde par aa gaye
 He clearly said that the court should postpone the hearing till July 2019
 yani tab tak is maamle main court sunwaayee lataka kar rakhe jab tak 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav na ho jaaen
 The court said that what is the connection with the general election
 is par sibbal kii daleel thi ki sunwaayee to adaalat ke is kaksh main ho rahi he, lekin iskaa asar desh bhar main padegaa
 The Chief Justice said that nothing like this happens
 ye bhi ek mukadmaa he
 It is also to be heard on the basis of facts and evidence
 lekin sibbal phir bole kisi ko kuch bhi lage, lekin meraa maananaa he ki asar hoga
 Because the Modi government's election manifesto also mentions the construction of Ram temple
 sarkaar ke raajnneetik agenda main ram mandir shaamil he
 If a decision is taken in this matter, this government will use it politically
 lihaaja kisi bhi tarah ise taala jaae
 But the court also ignored this argument
 sibbal ke saathi vakil dow
 Rajiv Dhawan even said that there are more than 19 thousand pages of documents
 teen mukhya pakshakaar hai
 There are more than 20 interwinners
 court ab se lekar har hafte somvaar se shuukravaar tak rojaanaa aath ghante bhi sunwaayee kare to agle saal aktubar se pehle sunwaayee puri nahin hogi
 That is, he said that the decision of this case is impossible under the tenure of Chief Justice Deepak Mishra
 adaalat ne unke is andaaj ko bhi hawa main uda diya
 The last argument was that a constitution bench consisting of five or seven judges should be heard by the same bench
 kyonki kuch saal pehle ek constitution bench ne ek mukademe main faisla sunaate hue kaha tha ki masjid islam kaa abhinn ang nahin he
 So now how will a three-judge bench decide the ownership of the mosque
 court ne is daleel ko bhi ye kah kar tarjeeh nahin di ki ye to civil suut kaa maamla he na ki constitution se judaa koi masalaa
 It was now the petitioners' lawyers to turn restless
 court ne jaise hi karrwai aage badhaate hue fact shit yani tathyon kaa silsilaa court ke saamne pesh karne ko kaha to sibbal or rajeev dhawan bhadak gaye
 He said that despite our legal objections and suggestions, if the court will hear, they will protest
 adaalat ne phir bhi udasin ravaiya apnaava
 On this, both lawyers pleaded to go out of the court room
 is par court ne daleelon kaa aadhaar banaae gaye dastavejon kii suchi par charchaa kii
 Taking the action further, the court said that the process of exchange of documents should be completed by January 15
 8 farvari ko yahi bench is maamle main sunwaayee karegi
 That is, by covering up the political aspect of a legal issue, this issue went one step further

 The winter havoc continues
 sardiyon ke mausam main thand se bachane ke liye log aksar room heater kaa sahaara lete hai
 In winter, the feeling of sitting in front of the heater amidst the cold winds makes people happy
 ham se adhiktar log to heater jalaakar hi sote hai
 If you also burn heaters in your homes to avoid the cold, then this news may disappoint you, let's know why
 
 
 room heater se sehat ko hote hai ye nuksaan-1
 When you burn the heater inside the house, the air released from it eliminates the moisturization from the environment around you
 hawa dry hone ke kaaran isse skin main khinchaav or allergy hone kaa khatra adhik rahata he
 2
 bacchon kii skin bahut zyada komal hoti he
 Dry air from the heater severely damages children's delicate skin
 kai baar isse bacchon ko jalane kaa khatra bhi rahata he
 3
 sabhi jaanate hai ki room heater hawa se moisture ko khatm kar detaa he, jisase hawa dry ho jaati he
 This can cause respiratory patients to have trouble breathing
 isliye jin logon ko asthma yaa skin sambandhi koi bhi beemaari ho, ve heater ke istemaal se bachane kii koshish karen
 4
 heater ke aage baithne ke baad room se baahar nikalne par sharir ke taapmaana main teji se badlaav hone lagate hai
 These changes can make a person a victim of many diseases
 5
 Sitting in front of the heater for a long time also threatens to burn the body
 skin sambandhi kai bimaariyaan ho sakati hai

 lite-camera-ection
 These are the three words to which the beats and dreams of millions of young people are connected
 magar in jagamagaati liton ke band hote hi bollywood kaa saamne aane vaala cheharaa behad kaala he
 Whether it is modeling or the film world, it is a market of fame that getting a glimpse of a dream is nothing short of fulfilling
 yahi vah jagah he jahaan sapanom ke saudagar sapanom kaa kaarobaar karte hai
 Thousands of young people are drawn to this dream every year to turn these dreams into reality
 lekin jab unka yah sapana tuutata he to sitaron kii chakachaundh main chuphi ek aisi duniya se hamaari mulaakaat hoti he jiskaa daagdar cheharaa hamamen se shaayad hi koi dekhnaa chahta ho
 This is not the Bollywood that dwells in you and our minds, but rather one where a whole black world fills behind the silver screen
 isi chamchamati duniya ke pichhawaade main ab aparaadh kii ek nai kahani dastak de chuki he
 a story that has given sleep to the Mumbai Police, a story that has shocked the youth who have come to realize dreams in the city of dreams
 kyonki yah kahani he bollywood or anderworld ke cocktail kii or iske nishane par hai aise rais log jo mayanagari main apni kismat aajamaane aate hai
 This is a completely new plot of the new team of underworld and models who wrote this new story of crime
 sajeesh he parade par chamakane ke liye apni kismat aajamaane mumbai aane vaale hajaaron-lakhon logon main se un logon ko chunakar maarna jinke paas keemtee property yaa dher sara rupaya he taaki unhen markar unki jaaydaad par aasaani se kabja kiya ja sake
 The two most important characters of this entire Chakravyuh are actor and model Simran Sood, who has worked in small films and Vijay Palande, a gangster Vijay Palande, who was associated with the underworld for nine years in a double murder case and shortly before Was released simran vah kadi he jo pehle shikaar ko talashti, usase dosti karti, filmon me kaam dilaane kaa jhansaa detii or phir baad main unki mulaakaat vijay plante se apane bhai ke taur par karwaati
 Simran, 37, came to Mumbai in the '90s with a dream of becoming a singer
 disipi pratap digaanvkar kehete hai, ''simran chunki khubasurat he isliye log jaldi usase dosti kar lete the
 She then plotted them in their trap to plot their property
 '' haalanki simran kaa kahana he ki, ''maine kuch nahin kiya
 Why don't you ask Vijay Palande, he will tell you everything
 maine kuch nahin kiya
 Police investigations revealed that Palande also had links with arrested underworld leader Santosh Shetty
 police ke paas bainkak main un donon kii mulakaaton ke saboot hai
 The first victim of Simran and Vijay Palande was 28-year-old Delhi-based businessman Karan Kakkar, who went to Mumbai to shine on the silver screen
 karan ke parivaar kaa dilli main real estate kaa kaarobaar he
 It didn't take Simran much time to befriend her as both lived in the same apartment in Mumbai
 karan kii bmadblu car dekhte hi simran samaj chuki thi ki uske paas kaaphi paisa he
 Hence the conspiracy to grab his money and car started
 kuch dinon kii dosti ke baad simran ne plante ko apana bhai bataakar karan se milwaaya
 Then slowly started coming to each other's home
 chah march kii shaam
 Palande and his partner Dhananjay Shinde called Kakkar on the pretext of introducing him to a financier at a restaurant in Lokhandwala, Mumbai
 phir unhone cold drink main neend kii dawa milakar karan ko pilaai jise pite hi use neend aane lagi
 Vijay then takes him to his home in his BMW car at Oshiwara's Oberoi Springs apartment
 dawa kii dose zyada thi, lihaaja flats main pahunchate hi karan gahari neend main chalaa gaya
 After this, Vijay and Dhananjay took Karan to the bathroom and sanded his throat with a sharp-edged weapon, made four pieces of his corpse and stuffed him in bags and went away from there
 iske baad donon 7 march kii subah karan ke flats main pahunche
 Then, after carrying those bags in the trunk of Karan's car, he reached the forest of Arre Colony near Mumbai and parked the car at a deserted place and both came back home
 bmadblu shaam tak yunhi khadi rahi
 In the evening, both of them reached back into the forest and got out in the car towards the mumbai-goa highway
 iske baad der raat vijay or dhananjay chiplun or satara ke saath kumbharali ghat pahunche
 He then threw the four bags at different places in the Kumbharli Ghat and returned the car to Mumbai, parked the car at one of his companions' houses
 katl se pehle donon karan kaa credit card or baaki keemtee saamaan bhi saath le aae the
 The first phase of the plot was completed
 ab aage kaa khel
 Both of them shopped with that card in a mall in Mumbai and made a mistake here
 darasal karan ne maut se ek din pehle yani 5 march ko dilli main apane ghar aakhri baar baat kii thi
 He then disappeared
 agle kai dinon tak koi khabar na milane par karan ke gharavaalon ne mumbai police main uski gumshudagi kii report darj kara di
 Although the police did not initially take the case seriously
 karan ke gharavaalon kaa aarope he ki police ne unhen taalane kii koshish kii
 Meanwhile, he also came to know that someone is using Karan's credit card
 jis mal main card istemaal hua tha, vahaan se karan ke gharavaale sisitivi footage bhi le aae or use police ko de diya
 Palande and Shinde were clearly visible in the footage
 magar police donon kii shinaakht tak nahin kar pai
 Meanwhile, after shopping himself, Palande gave Karan's card to Simran
 vah march main hi bangkok gai or vahaan jamkar shopping kii
 But with the statement of the card, Karan's family came to know about it
 unhone police ko bataaya
 But she could not reach them
 use na karan kii khabar mili, na hi uski bmadblu car
 Householders continued to revolve around delhi-mumbai
 is bich thik ek maheene baad 7 april ko ek doosraa murder ho gaya
 This was the second mistake of Palande and Simran
 darasal 7 april kii raat lokhandwala ke ek flats main dilli ke actor anuj tikku ke pita arun tikku kaa katl ho gaya
 In the investigation, it was found that Anuj Tikku had kept two tenants in his house
 unamem se ek dhananjay scindia tha
 These tenants were hired by model Simran Sood and gangster Palande
 sajeesh yah thi ki anuj kaa katl kar uski karodon kii jaaydaad par kabja kar liya jaae or phir uski laash ko kakkad kii laash kii tarah thikaane laga diya jaae
 Simran introduced Palande to Anuj as well, calling him Karan Sood
 par gadabad yah ho gai ki ghar main kirayedar rakhane kii khabar jab dilli main anuj ke pita arun tikku ko mili to ve mumbai aa gaye or palaande ke saathiyon ko ghar se baahar nikaal diya
 Therefore, Vijay decided to remove his father Arun Tikku from the path before Anuj Tikku
 sajeesh ke tahat katl ke ek din pehle vijay plante anuj ko apane saath ghumaane ke bahaane goa le gaya
 
 
 Seeing the opportunity here, both Palande's companions attacked Arun Tikku with knives
 un par chaaku ke kul 12 waar kiye gaye par katl ke dauraan hue shor-sharabe se guard chaukas ho gaya or usne police ko khabar kar di
 But the murderer jumped from the window before the police arrived
 baad main police ne anuj ke bayaan par simran, plante or dhananjay ko giraftaar kar liya
 The Mumbai Police claims that the trio soon confessed their crime
 udhar teenon kii tasviren tivi or akhabaaron main dekhakar achaanak karan kakkad ke gharavaale chaunk uthe
 Because Palande and Shinde were the ones who were caught in CCTV cameras while shopping at the mall on Karan's credit card
 karan ke gharavaalon ne fouran mumbai pahunchakar police ko is baat kii jaankaree di
 After strict police action, all three confessed to Karan's murder
 is tarah ek katl se duusare katl kaa raaj khulaa
 If Mumbai Police had shown promptness on the complaint of Karan's family members, Arun Tikku might have survived
 ab use karan ke gharavaalon ke is aarope kaa jawaab dena hoga ki usne karan kii gumshudagi report darj karne main der kyon kii
 Meanwhile, the police is also investigating Simran's high profile relationships and acquaintances
 vah mumbai ke pej-thri cirkil main sakriy thi or ipiel partiyon main bhi jaati thi
 Police investigation has revealed that Simran is also identified with stock broker Gautam Vora
 police ne vora se poochtacha kii he

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar made it clear that the government was ready for talks after news of one of the four policemen held hostage during the encounter in Lakhisarai district of Bihar last Sunday
 patna main yojit ek kaarykram ke dauraan nitish ne bandhak banaae gaye ek pulicekarmi kii hatya kiye jane sambandhi khabar ke bare main kaha ki yah sahi he yaa nahin, is bare main unhen pakki soochna nahin he lekin vah manaayenge ki yah khabar sahi nahin ho
 The Chief Minister questioned what was the fault of the four policemen taken hostage
 unhone kaha ki kisi ko bandhak banaakar moltol karnaa ucch adarsh yaa achche siddhant kaa parichaayak nahin he
 He said, 'we can only expect from others and who is not ready to talk, we are sitting ready
 ’ unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar har haalat main maanavadhikaar kii raksha karti he or iske liye patibaddh he
 He said that even in the Chief Minister's conference in Delhi, he said that Maoists with leftist ideology are also part of the society and in the same way the policemen are also part of the society
 avar nireekshak abhaya yadav kii patni sahit bandhak pulicekarmiyon ke parijanon dwaara unke awaas ke paas vilaap karne ke bare main mukhyamantri ne kaha ki vah unase mili the or unhen dhankos bhi bandhaaya tha
 Nitish Kumar appealed to all intellectuals across the country to take interest in it for the safe release of the policemen held hostage by the Naxalites
 unhone kaha ki patna se kai buddhajiviyon ne apil kii he, pashchim bengal se mahasweta ji ne bhi apil kii he
 He said that everyone has an obligation in this matter and this is a problem about which people will have to think seriously
 ullekhneey he ki lakhisarai jile main gat ravivaar ko muthbhed ke dauraan bandhak banaae gaye chaar pulicekarmiyon main se ek abhaya yadav kii maovadiyon ne hatya kar dene kaa daawa kiya he
 However, this has not been confirmed at the government level
 naksaliyon dwaara bandhak banaae gaye pulisakmiryon main se ek kii hatya kiye jane kii soochna milane par mukhyamantri awaas ke sameep suraksha badhaa di gayi or us ore jane vaale sabhi margo ko sil kar diya gaya
 However, officials are refraining from saying anything about its reasons
 pratibandhit naksali sanghathan bhakpa maovadi ke swayambhu pravaktaa avinaash ne bataaya ki rihaai ke liye di gayi samay-seemaa ke samaapt hone ke baad bandhakon main se ek abhaya yadav kii unki cameti ke aadesh par hatya kar di gayi he
 He threatened that the other hostages would be killed if the government did not leave eight of its jailed colleagues till 10 am on Friday
 apper police mahanideshak (mukhyalay) pi ke thakur ne spasht kiya ki chaaron bandhak surakshit hai or abhyapur ke paas jo shav mila he, vah abhaya yadav kaa nahin he
 He said that police action would continue for the release of the policemen
 isse purv naksali pravaktaa avinaash ne kaha tha ki abhaya yadav kaa shav jahaan rakhaa jayega, uski soochna sthaneey thana athwa mediakarmi ko de di jaaegi
 Following this statement, an unidentified body was found by the police in the Abhaypur police station area of lakhisarai
 avinaash ne kaha ki is maamle main naksaliyon se baatcheet ke liye na to kisi bahari vyakti or na hi sarkaar dwaara koi pahal kii gayi he tathaa baaki bache bandhakon ke bare main bhi nirnay unki cameti legi
 In contrast to the remarks of Union Home Secretary GK Pillai, Sapphire made it clear that there has been no interaction with Naxalites in this regard at the police and administrative level of the state
 udhar rajd pramukh lalu prasad ne halaat ko thik nahin bataate hue naksaliyon se apil kii ki agar ve hinsa tyaag kar ahimsa kaa rasta apanaaen
 He said that the soldiers have no fault, they go where the government sends
 unhone kaha ki ve bhi samaaj kaa hissaa hai
 While Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not get tired of insisting on his vision of 'ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat', the two incidents of gang rape in his party-ruled states have not only embarrassed the countrymen but also brought out the reality of the claims of women safety
 Has given upi keunnavamein to bijepi kaa vidhayak hirepaur phir peedit ke pita kii hatya kaa mukhya aaropee he
 At the same time, the entire country, including Bollywood, is expressing outrage over the heinous incident of murder after the gang-rape of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua, Jammu and Kashmir
 upi main jahaan bijepi kii khud kii sarkaar he, vahiin jammu or kashmir main pidipi ke saath bijepi kii gathbandhan sarkaar he
 Speaking from memory, Banharani said that many women ministers of Bombay, who have always been vocal on the issue of women safety, also appeared on the backfoot on Thursday about the incidents of Unnao and Kathua
 kendriya soochna or prasaaran mantri smriti irani ko bijepi main mukhar or ojasvi vaktaaon main mana jaataa he
 When India Today reporter wanted to know Smriti Irani's reaction to the gang rape incidents in Kathua and Unnao, she thought it better to remain silent
 baar-baar sawaal puche jane par bhi smriti irani ne in ghatnaon par ek shabd nahin bolaa or car main baithkar ravaanaa ho gayi
 The government will do its job: Union Minister Smriti Irani, who always speaks highly of the government's policies, was expected so much on this sensitive issue that she would have assured strict action
 smriti dilli ke hanuman mandir main bijepi ke upwas ke liye ain thim
 The BJP had kept this fast against the Congress not allowing Parliament to run
 isi mudde par jab kendriya swasthya or parivaar kalyaan rajya mantri anupriya patel se baat kii gai to unhone itnaa hi kaha ki sarkaar apana kaam kar rahi he or sunishchit kiya jayega ki peediton ko insaaf mili
 Rahul asked that please tell that all opposition parties, including Congress, are targeting the BJP over both these incidents
 congress ne uttar pradesh main bijepi ke shashan ko ‘ravanraj’ tak kaa naam de daalaa he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has questioned in a tweet whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will keep a fast in protest against atrocities on women and poor law and order situation in BJP ruled states
 modi sarkaar kii ek or firebrand mantri uma bharti ne congress ke bayanon par koi pratikriya nahin di lekin logon se kathua kii ghatana ko sampradayik rang dene kii koshish karne waalon se saavdhaan rahane kii apil kii
 Union Drinking Water Minister Uma Bharti said that this is a heinous crime and the less condemned it is
 is ghatana main kanoon ko apana kaam karne diya jaae
 Union Women and Child Welfare Minister Maneka Gandhi commended Yogi Adityanath government for handing over the investigation of Unnao gang rape case to CBI
 menka gandhi ne kaha ki kanoon apana kaam kar rahaa he or peediton ko insaaf milegaa
 However, when Maneka Gandhi was questioned over the delay in justice, she thought it better to keep silence
 zyada arsa nahin hua jab centre main upie ke shashan ke dauraan nirbhaya rape cese ko lekar janaakrosh ke bich bijepi mahila suraksha ko lekar manmohan sarkaar par hamale karte nahin thakti thi
 During the campaign for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had also given the slogan - 'enough women are being tortured, this time Modi government'
 kathua par boleen minakshinirbhaya rape cese par aakrosh jataane ke liye bijepi kii ore se tab sadakon par jo mahila chehre utre the, ab wo aisi ghatnaon par raajnneeti ke liye vipaksh ko koste nahin thak rahe
 BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi slammed the opposition over the Kathua incident, saying that they can accuse anyone, even those who were not present there
 lekin kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 They (opposition) do not respect Parliament, they do not respect the law, then why are they speaking such language
 kathua or unnav par bolne ko beshak bijepi netaaon ke paas zyada kuch naa ho lekin vipaksh ke khilaaf apane upwas ko lekar ve bad-chadh kar logon kaa dhyaan khinchne kii koshish karte dikhe

 Radha and Krishna's love is shown in a very convincing manner
 jis krishna ke viraat rup ke saamne kurukshetra main 18 akshuhinee sena drushti kho baithi thi vahi krishna avash najar aate hai
 The epilogue is the story of the tragedy, destiny and struggle of man

 On the silence of the Congress, bjp's defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman on behalf of the BJP, targeted the Congress leadership on the Nevadra issue
 sitaraman ne dilli main ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki sonia gandhi or rahul kii chuppi se mana jayega ki unhone wadra ke khilaaf aaropon ko sweekaar kar liya he
 Citing media reports, Sitharaman alleged that the London-based house belonging to Vadra was furnished by Bhandari and that he had also arranged Vadra's visit abroad

 The government is taking all steps to bring the absconding arms dealer back to India
 gujarat ke siem ne lagaae aaropawahin bijepi pravaktaa jiviel narsimh raav ne kaha ki agar congress maanati he ki wadra nirdosh hai, to manahani kaa maamla kyon nahin daayar karti
 Silence indicates guilt

 He is also visiting Gujarat again and again
 lekin vah mudde par khamosh kyon hai? yahaan tak ki gujarat congress ke netaa bhi kyon chup hai? rahul gandhi ko hathiyaar saudagar se wadra ke sambandhon par spashtikaran dena chahie
 Vadra's message on Facebook did not respond to the allegations, but gave a message
 unhone apane fasebuk pej par apni tasviir ke saath post kiya, 'suprabhat, main sakasham hum, main majboot hum
 i believe in myself, i can turn my dreams into plans, and make my plan into reality
 ' vahiin, bangalooru main congress pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki wadra ko pichley 41 maheene se nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he

 Are you ready for sailing on the streets of cities? Can we withstand cyclonic storms? Are we ready for unseasonal rain, cold or heat? 
 
 
 paryaavaran se jude ye sawaal kuch puraane pad gaye hai
 The new questions may be like this: Are you ready for a loss in earnings? Are we in a position to pay expensive electricity bills? Do you have arrangements to bear the cost of keeping your health well? Will you be able to bear the cost of insurance premiums? Rage weather debates have now shifted from theoretical discussions about the environment into concrete economic circles, where long-term plans to reduce carbon emissions are more concerned about how to deal with the daily effects

 Aon Plc's Fresh Reinsurance Market Outlook report states that since 2005 the insurance industry's loss from natural disasters has increased from an average of $ 15 billion annually to $ 100 billion in 2011
 2015 tak pichley teen varshon main yah ausatan 20 se 40 arab dollar rahaa
 Swiss Re, the world's largest reinsurance firm, estimates that the total economic cost of disasters was $ 59 billion in the first half of 2014, with insurance companies suffering $ 21 billion

 If the insurance coverage of disasters in India is to double the current level, then insurance companies will have to raise heavy reinsurance and people will have to be prepared to pay a hefty premium

 saath hi apane vibhaag main hi aise wing banaae jo sirf jameenon kii jeeyocoding yaa geotaging ke liye kaam kare
 But for this work, this institute should be chosen and they should be given such rights
 1905 se pehle desh main jameen kii registry yaa registration or nakshe banane kaa kaam survey of india ke paas hi tha
 But after that due to political reasons, this work was removed from the Survey of India
 sirf nakshe banane kaa kaam diya gaya
 Sanjay Kumar said that the land matters have increased in the courts due to change of department, since 1905, when the matter of land registry came to the Department of Land Resources and Rural Development, the cases related to land in the courts increased
 iskaa sabase bada kaaran yah tha ki jameen kii simaaon kaa prashasnic survey nahin hua tha
 Patwari used to place a map on a log, used to mark it and tell people how much your land is
 jameen kii simaaon ke malikana haq ko lekar itane andeh hue ki lakhon kii sankhya main jameen se jude maamle adaalaton main vichaaradhin hai
 The demand for think tanks, PMO for geospatial facilities, national strategy geocoding or geotagging will end ownership disputes, Sanjay Kumar said that the way the government had demonetised the rupees, it should also demonetize the lands and make them geocoding or geotagging
 So nobody will have any problem
 kyonki jeeyocoding hone ke baad aapaki sampatti kii sahi nakshaa, uskaa sahi aakaar, sahi naap sabakuch ek number ke andar aa jayega
 As with the Aadhaar number
 isamen aapke bare main sari jaankariyaan rahati hai
 If the government wishes, geocoding or geotagging can take place in the next five years
 haalanki ye janaganana jaisaa hi vrihad str or jatil kaam hoga
 If there is geomapping of the lands, then the biggest corruption is over, Sanjay Kumar said that if the government starts doing satellite or geomapping of the lands, then the collusion of politicians, administrative officials and goons will end
 yani jameen se jude bhrashtachar ke maamle khatm ho jaaenge
 If not, it will decrease
 kyonki desh main kaledhan se zyada bada he jameen mafiaon kaa kaam
 Due to these, there was a problem in demonetization and it had almost failed
 purv ISRO chif bole- jald sabake mobile par hoga bhartiya GPS, company ne kiya prayoggiospetial se desh ko kya-kya phayda hoga?sanjay kumaar ne bataaya ki jeeyospetial sevaaon or suvidhaon se raksha, transport, health, mobile, health, kanjumar delivery, masping aadi desh ko kaaphi madad milegi
 People will get location based information easily
 log jeeyospetial suvidhaon ko upyog roj karte hai lekin unhen pataa nahin he
 You ask for food online, go by taxi
 ye sab lokation aadhaarit sevaayen hai
 These are called Geospatial
 aap sochie ki jeeyospetial suvidhaayen badhegi to kitna phayda hoga
 Now there are no traditional wars, there are trade wars, Sanjay Kumar said that now there are no traditional war wars
 trade war hote hai
 These trades occur in view of geolocation of war countries
 jaisaa ki 1991 main america ne bharat ke khilaaf kiya tha
 Russia also refused to help
 ye to ab bhi hota he
 Why does the country need geospatial? Sanjay Kumar said that around 1997, you did not get easy maps of the country
 nakshe public domen main the hi nahin
 These maps were held by the Ministry of Defense, Survey of India or a few institutions
 tab maine nakshon par kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 After a year of campaigning, in 1998, the Ministry of Defense came forward and made a policy that only 9 government departments can digitize maps
 lekin digitalizesen bhi kaisaa ki puraane map kii tasviir uthaakar internet par daalaa ja rahaa tha
 ISRO will leave tomorrow the mighty defense satellite, the connection with the Mumbai attacks was brought to digital map policy in 2005, Sanjay Kumar said that this was in 2002 when George Fernandes was the defense minister
 murali manohar joshi, suresh prabhu, isro chairman kasturirangan or science-technology secretary ramamurti ne ham logon ke saath baat kii
 Suresh Prabhu was then the doer of the project connecting the river
 is team ko nadi jodne ke liye digital terrene model chahie tha
 At that time the Survey of India was not able to do this work
 hamane us samay se digital masping ke bare main jaagrukta failaai
 As a result of our hard work, the National Map Policy came into the country in 2005

 amaavas ek thriller horer bollywood movie he
 Whenever we talk about the films of this genre, i miss Mama, The Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense, Conjuring series, Oculus etc
 in filmon main story hoti he, suspence hota he, thrill hota he or jaahir he dar bhi
 But what do we get when we find such films in Bollywood? Scary scenes, forced songs and a lot of drama
 kahani kaa kahin namonishaan nahin
 Amavas is also like this, just as the moon is not seen on the night of Amavas, in the same way you will not see a story anywhere in the Amavas movie
 baaki kamjor story ko dhakne ke liye or film ko angeging banane ke liye sanud effects or chote chote horer seen kaa istemaal bakhubi kiya gaya he
 Story itself has been abolished in the process of creating suspense
