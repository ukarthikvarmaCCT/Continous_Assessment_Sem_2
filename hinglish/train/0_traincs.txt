 bijepi ne ramnath kovind ko raashtrapati chunaav ke liye apana ummidavaar ghoshit kiya to vipaksh ke saath talkhi phir ekbar saamne aa gai
 Accusing the BJP of pretending to be a consensus, the Congress said that they would clear their stand after meeting with opposition parties
 ek taraf jahaan endie main shaamil shivasena ne abhi apane pattey nahin khole hai vahiin duusari bijedy jaise garendie dal bhi kovind ke naam par sahamat dikh rahe hai
 Let's see what the equation is about the presidential election right now
 
 
 endie ke paksh main he samikarankovind ke naam ke elaan kii ekatarfa faisla agar bijepi ne kiya he to uske peeche vartmaan samikarnon kaa sidhaa haath he
 If you look at the Electoral College for the presidential election, 57
 85% sameekaran sattadhari endie ke paksh main dikh rahe hai
 In such a situation, if the opposition is also its candidate, then the chances of victory are slim
 kya he number gemerashtrapati chunaav ke liye agar elactoral college main endie ke paksh main he 5,37,683 jo ki kul kaa 48
 It makes up 93%
 lekin tiares, ediemke, wiesar congress ne endie ummidavaar ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kiya he to ab endie ke paksh main kul 57
 85% of the vote takes place
 bijedy bhi endie ke paksh menodisha ke siem or bijedy chif naveen patnayak ne somvaar shamramnath kovind kii ummidavaarike samarthan kaa elaan kiya
 This leaves 2 in favor of NDA
 99% kii or vruddhi ho gai
 Although there are speculations on the discussion on several names, including Meira Kumar, by the opposition, it may be difficult for the two UP parties BSP and SP to oppose Kovind
 kyonki ramnath kovind dalik samudaay se aate hai
 His candidature for the BJP could prove to be a masterstroke
 upi ke dalon ke liye virodh mushkilspa or basapa kii ore se kovind kii ummidavaari par thos virodh saamne nahin aayaa he
 No party would want to be seen opposing the Dalit candidate before the 2019 elections
 vahiin jediu adhyaksh or bihar ke siem nitish kumaar kaa rukh bhi kovind kii ummidavaari par naram dikh rahaa he
 Ramnath Kovind is currently the Governor of Bihar and has had a good rapport with Nitish Kumar
 nitish kumaar ne kovind kii ummidavaari kaa swaagat kiya he haalanki, samarthan ke maamle par vipaksh kii baithak ke baad faisle kii baat bhi kahi he
 These 4 names discussed by the opposition, the opposition can field a joint candidate against NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind in the presidential election
 vam dalon main sutron ne somvaar kii raat yah baat kahi
 non-nda parties are expected to meet on 22 June to discuss the issue
 sutron ke anusaar purv loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar, purv kendriya mantri susheel kumaar scindia, bharipa bahujan mahasang ke netaa or dow
 Opposition parties are considering Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar, grandson of BR Ambedkar, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi and retired bureaucrat Gopalakrishna Gandhi and some other names

 'gippy' is the story of a girl who is overweight and lives with her divorced mother and younger brother
 jis skool main vah padhati he, vahaan uske saathi uske motaape or saadagi kaa mazaaq udaate hai or use nakaara samajhate hai
 However, he is accompanied by his close friends, who are always ready to help him
 duusari taraf he class kii intellegent or khubasurat ladki shamira, jo har maamle main gippi se aage he or aksar gippi ko nicha dikhaane ke maukey dhundti rahati he
 Filmmaker Sonam Nair has beautifully portrayed the mentality and troubles of Gippy-age girls with a little humor
 yah film dekhakar aap shaayad apane bachapan main laut jaaen
 The simplicity of the film and its characters will make you laugh and will also take you on a journey of memories
 gippi ke kirdaar main riya vij ne acha kaam kiya he or unki maa ke kirdaar main divya datta bhi khub janchi hai
 Shammi Kapoor's songs have been put to good use in the film, which gives good momentum to the film
 iske saath hi ye gane 'gippi' ke kirdaar ko or majboot banaate hai
 What i missed was the personal conversation of the young girls shown in the film
 
 Which could have saved the filmmakers, because many girls might hesitate to share some things with the family
 tippaniyan Apart from this, it seems that the audience is not seeing another 'student of the Year', but later director Sonam Nair took over the film
 kul milakar main kahuunga ki ek chote bajet kii film, chote bacchon kii kahani ke saath bada sandesh de jaati he
 Which has been beautifully screened
 film main ek or kirdaar he arjuna, jise gippi apana bwoyfriend bananaa chaahati he
 It is played by Taha Shah
 
 
 shaha kaa screen pregence kamaal kaa he
 The work of the rest of the cast is also commendable, so my rating for the film is - 3

 Along with this, these songs further strengthen the character of 'gippy'
 mujhe jo kami lagi, vah thi film main dikhaai gai kam umr kii ladakiyon kii nijee baatcheet
 
 jisase filmkaar batch sakate the, kyonki kai ladkiyaan shaayad kuch baton ko parivaar se share karne se sankoch kare
 The comments iske alaava interval tak yah lagata he ki kahin darshakon ko ek or 'student of da year' to nahin dikhaai ja rahi, par baad main nirdeshak sonam nair ne film ko sambhaal liya
 Overall i would say that a small budget film gives a big message with the story of young children

 Another character in the film is Arjun, whom Gippy wants to make her boyfriend

 is tikdi ke samarthan ko saath lekar congress gujarat main bijepi ko karaari takkar dene main kaamyaab rahi or bijepi ko 99 siton par hi roak diya
 OBC leader Alpesh Thakor had joined the Congress even before the elections
 gujarat main vidhayak ban chuke alpesh thakor ne ab madhya pradesh kaa rukh kiya he
 His attempt is to unite the OBC community in Madhya Pradesh against the BJP
 somvaar klylpesh thakorne bhopal main kaha ki bijepi ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle satta main aane par do karod rojgaar dene kaa vaada kiya tha jisamen wo naakaam rahi
 The party's government at the center is now asking the top management and technical institutes to sell pakoras to the students who have passed out
 gujarat ke congress vidhayak thakor madhya pradesh ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main sattarudh bijepi ke khilaaf sthaneey obisi netaaon ke saath saajha morcha khadaa karne kaa elaan karne ke liye bhopal aae
 Thakore said, 'we are fighting against poverty, fighting for farmers and unemployed youth
 hamaara morcha obisi samudaay ke garib, kisaanon or berozegaar yuvaaon se samarthan jutayega
 This front will support the party if the expectations of these sections are included in the Congress election manifesto
 ’thakor ne daawa kiya ki ve hardik patel or jignesh mewaani ke saath milakar madhya pradesh main bijepi ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaayenge
 According to Thakor, the Momentum that remained in Gujarat will be further extended in Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh kii rajyapal anandi ben patel kii is salaah ki yuva pakora bechney ko chota naa maane, par thakor ne kaha, ‘wo meri antee hai, main sirf itnaa hi kah saktaa hum ki gujarat main mahilaayein pakora banane or khaane ko pasand karti hai
 i also like pakoras but this does not mean that students from top management and technical institutes should be asked to sell pakoras
 ye sarkaar kaa daayitv he ki wo desh ke yuvaaon ko rojgaar ke avasar uplabdh karaae
 i will request the Governor to give any logical advice to the government
 ’thakor ne madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko ahamkaari netaa bataaya
 For this, he cited the incident of slapping a security officer of his own on behalf of the Chief Minister
 thakor ne kaha, ‘pehle mukhyamantri ne security officer ko tamaacha jadaa or baad main daleel di ki ve apane or aam aadmi ke bich milane main rukaawat karne vaale kisi shaks ko bardaasht nahin kar sakate
 While the officer was just performing his duty
 ’ thakor ne kaha ki janata ko aise logon ko satta se ukhaad baahar karnaa chahie

 29 oktober yani buudhvaar ko tufaani hawaaon or musaladhar barish ke saath nelofar se gujarat kaa saamana hoga
 All the ports of Gujarat have been evacuated, fishermen have been barred from entering the sea and the population living on the coast has been shifted to safer places

 Cyclone 'nilofar' has become more powerful in the Arabian Sea
 isaki hawaaon kii raftaar 120 se 130 kilometre prati ghante ho chuki he
 This is the reason why it has now been put in the 'weary Seawear' cyclone category
 cyclone 'nelofar' badi teji se apni jagah par takat bator rahaa he
 It is feared that by 29 October its speed will reach 140 to 150 kilometers per hour

 Due to this, strong winds will run at a speed of 100 to 110 km in the coastal areas of Kutch and the rains will disturb people in all areas

 vishaal bharadwaj kii haalia relies film 'haidar' in dinon charchaa main he
 'haider' had a decent start at the box office compared to 'bang Bang', but the film's buzz in critics' streets has gained momentum
 yun to film main sabhi kirdaar apane-aap main jabardast hai, lekin in sab ke bich jin do kalakaaron ne sabakaa dhyaan khinchaa he vah hai 'salmaan' or 'salmaan'
 If you have seen 'haider' then you must have seen a light smile on your face as soon as you read this
 lekin yadi aapane ab tak film nahin dekhi he to pehle parde par in donon 'salmaan' kii ek jhalak dekh lijie-to film shahid kapur kii he
 But the discussion is about 'salman'
 yah jaij he, kyonki relies se pehle film ke nirmaataaon ne is ore yah special trailor relies kar salmaan ke phens ko 'salmaan or salmaan' kaa tohfa bhi diya tha
 But very few people know about these 'salman' of reel life
 darasal, internet kii vishaal duniya bhi inke bare main simit jaankaree hi rakhti he, lekin jo kuch he vah kuch aise he-1
 Sumit Kaul - The original name of Salman before 'haider' is Sumit Kaul
 lits, camera or ection kii duniya main vah nae hai
 But Sumit's innings, which started as TV and voice over artist, has now reached the movies
 vah isse pehle film 'bambu' main bhi najar aa chuke hai

 Another information is that Rajat has also played a minor role in the 2013 release Mumbai Mirror

 Since the election of the new BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, an active atmosphere is being seen to stop copying
 sarkaar ne jahaan iske maddenjar helpline number jari kiya he
 So at the same time, many areas of the state are being heard and heard about the mafia mafia
 haalanki vipaksh is mudde par paryaapt sakriyata na baratane ke liye sarkaar ko gherne kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Read what the different personalities are saying about the government? What did Javadekar say on Aaj Tak sting on cheating? Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar says that this is an unfortunate reality
 kuch rajyon main nakal hoti he or unhen yuva morcha ke din yaad aate hai
 They say that under Kalyan Singh's chief ministership, Rajnath Singh enacted a law to prevent copying as education minister
 ve kisi bhi tareeke se nakal ko nahin sweekaarte
 Be it states like Bihar or Haryana
 ve bihar ke bheetar nakal ko lekar dikhne vaale najaaron kaa zikr karte hai
 Also mention that the KUP will decide the state government's priorities
 haalanki ve yah sabakuch viraasat main milane kaa zikr karte hai or aage ise durust karne kii baat karte hai
 They talk to talk to the state government about this
 nakal mafia par kya bole rajeev shukla?congress netaa rajeev shukla nakal mafia ke sawaal par kehete hai ki uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri nakal mafia par nakel kasne ke bajaay desh bhar main gum rahe hai
 They talk of taking concrete steps regarding education and want the government to be strict in this matter

 Since then, there is a stir in the entire state
 panama dastavejon ke li maamle ko saamne aae lagbhag ek maheene kaa samay guzar chukaa he
 But because of that, the political storm in Pakistan is not taking its name
 pichley kuch hafton se sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main jis tarah kii hai-tauba najar aa rahi he, waisi haal ke varshon main dekhne ko nahin mili thi
 The Sharif family is losing its sweat in defending the alleged huge foreign assets and money transactions
 haalanki li hue dastavejon main pakistani pradhanmantri kaa naam pratyaksh rup se to nahin he lekin videsh main unke vishaal paariwarik kaarobaar ko lekar jo jaankariyaan saamne ai hai, usase unki gheraabandi jarur ho gai he
 Companies owned by Sharif's son and daughter were allegedly used to acquire property worth millions of pounds in Britain
 ab yah yakeen karnaa mushkil he ki apane bacchon kii sampattiyon se sharif kaa koi sarokaar nahin he
 The arguments that his family and government spokespersons have made in the defense at the moment have failed to give any satisfactory answer to the basic questions arising about the source of funds
 navaj sharif ke liye yah ghumkar phir laut aati niyati sareekha he
 He has lost the chair twice in the middle of the term due to the confrontation between the different centers of power twice before
 panama li ke baad ke dinon main ve pehle hi do baar desh ko sambodhit bhi kar chuke hai
 He appears to be in the same state of desperation as he was in 1993, when he was sacked for corruption charges in the waning days of his first term as Prime Minister
 ek baar phir 23 saal baad ve khud ko ghira hua paa rahe hai
 All the major political parties are demanding that they clear the situation regarding the source of wealth of their family assets abroad
 yakeenan, sharif ke tisare kaarykaal kii yah sabase badi chunauti he, 2014 main rajdhani islamabad main imran khan-dow
 Greater than the challenge of siege of Qadri
 ve badi najuk sthiti main hai
 Sharif himself has never been a good speaker, his speech of last week was clearly showing signs of desperation and he was barely able to defend himself and his family from allegations of corruption
 masalaa sirf kisi ghotaale main fanse hone kaa nahin he
 The crisis is that Sharif has been facing one successive problem after another and every difficulty in solving seems more complicated than the previous
 haalanki sara focus is samay panama li par he lekin jaanch kaa asli mudda paise ke us pravaah par he jo ghumkar kathith taur par khud pradhanmantri tak pahunchataa he
 Although Sharif has categorically denied any wrongdoing in his speech in the name of the country, earlier investigations by Pakistani agencies seem to air his claims
 masalan, panama li se lagbhag do dashak pehle kii nabbe ke dashak ke madhya kii exiye jaanch report main un apartment kaa byora he jo kathith taur par sharif parivaar ke hai or lagbhag 7 karod dollar mulya ke videshi bank khaaton kaa bhi zikr he
 In this 200-page report, many details about the alleged foreign accounts of the family were also revealed
 ab kaha jaataa he ki ve tamaam parisampattiyaan kai guna bad chuki hai
 Sharif's family dismissed the report in detail in several foreign newspapers, dismissing it as 'malicious' and threatened to file a case against these newspapers
 aaropon ke khilaaf unka bachaav behad kamjor najar aata he
 This financial scam is exactly like the charge sheet that former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto faced in 1996, after which she was ousted from power
 haalanki kar chori, mani londering or bainkon kii adaayagi main chook ke zyaadaatar aarope to nae nahin hai lekin sharif parivaar ko pehali baar videshi companiyon or videshi khaaton kaa aarope jhelana pad rahaa he
 When Sharif returned to power in February 1997, the FIA investigation was quashed on the grounds that it was politically motivated
 panama li main bhi sirf sharif parivaar hi ghere main nahin he
 About 200 prominent Pakistani businessmen, leaders have also been exposed and questions have been raised about the source of their alleged hidden assets
 sharif ke liye 'panamaget' saamne aane kaa isse kharaab samay nahin ho saktaa tha kyonki unki sarkaar ko pehle hi kai sari andruni or bahari chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Maybe, they still come out of this crisis, but their image will be deeply hurt
 yah dekhnaa he ki kya ve 2018 main apana kaarykaal puraa hone tak pad par bane rah paaenge
 Recognizing the opposition's demand, Sharif has requested the Chief Justice to appoint a judicial commission to investigate allegations of corruption
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki yadi unke khilaaf kisi bhi gadabadi kii baat sabit ho jaati he to ve pad chhodane ke liye taiyaar hai
 At present, the opposition is not satisfied with these things
 ab is baat kii maang jor pakad rahi he ki ek swatantra or paardarshee jaanch mukammal karaane ke liye unhen apane pad se hat janaa chahie
 Another factor that has increased Sharif's problems is the role of the army in the current scenario
 yah saaf he ki sena ke general is rajnatik sankat kii vajah se shashan ko pangu hote dekhakar khamosh nahin baithenge
 This unprecedented statement by the Chief of Army Staff is giving a very poor indication in which he has spoken of 'accountability for all'
 kai vishleshak ise sarkaar ke liye chetavanee ke taur par dekh rahe hai
 It is also interesting to note that soon after the accountable statement of General Raheel Sharif, the names of some senior military officers who were dismissed on corruption charges after an internal investigation were also revealed
 panamaget ne desh main puraa rajnatik paridrishy hi badal daalaa he
 Sharif's big challenge is how to deal with the situation if the deadlock persists
 lanbaa gatirodh desh main loktantric prakriya ko bhi kuch sthaayee nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Will Sharif withstand this prolonged heat of dissatisfaction? At present, the signs are not good for this person who became the Prime Minister for the third time
 ek taaja adhyayan main saamne aayaa he ki har din 10 lakh se zyada musafir tikat nahin milane kii vajah se trainon main safar nahin kar pate hai
 There is a huge difference between demand and supply in long distance trains, which means that more people want to travel than the number of seats available in a particular train
 haalanki is antar ko kabhi bhi zyada mahatv nahin diya gaya he
 railyatri
 in kii ore se janvari 2016 se antar kaa vishleshan karne ke liye deshbhar main tikat booking pattern par najar rakhi ja rahi he
 Based on data received from train passengers across the country, the study revealed that there are 10 to 12 lakh passengers who are unable to travel due to tickets not confirmed on a daily basis
 ye ve log hai jinke vetelist tikat conform nahin hue
 On a percentage basis, it accounts for about 13 per cent of long-distance train passengers daily
 peak sijan main to yah aankada badhkar 19 pratishat pahunch jaataa he
 Analysis railyatri based on this model
 in ne 3100 railway steshnon par 2800 gadiyon main seat talash rahe 30 lakh se adhik yatriyon kii ore se darj travel plan kaa vishleshan karne ke liye ganitiya model kaa upyog kiya
 Using the Prediction model, it was estimated that this effect is happening on the country on a daily basis
 anand vihaar railway stesan kaa pratishat sabase zyadaais adhyayan main pramukh steshnon or yatriyon ke pratishat kii ek list taiyaar kii gai jinhone tikat to book karaayaa lekin seat conform nahin hone ke chalate safar nahin kar sake
 For example, about 43 percent of the passengers who reserve tickets from Delhi's Anand Vihar railway station are not confirmed
 jammu tavi stesan se har roj kareeb 38 pratishat yatriyon kaa tikat conform nahin ho paata
 About 33 percent of the passengers at Mumbai's Lokmanya Tilak Terminal are unable to get reserved tickets
 haavda railway stesan se 28 pratishat yatriyon ko pratidin tikat nahin mil paata
 Apart from this, 21 percent at Bangalore City Junction and Haridwar Junction, 20 percent at Pune Junction and Guwahati Railway Station, 19 percent passengers daily at Chennai Central and Gorakhpur Junction are unable to get reserved tickets

 The central government has initiated legal action against 60 people allegedly holding black money in foreign bank accounts
 sutron ne enditivi ko yah jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki in khaaton main kul milakar 1500 karod rupee se zyada jamaa hai
 Along with this, he told that these people also include the names of people associated with big corporate houses
 unhone bataaya ki inakam tex adhikariyon ke swatantra jaanch main in 60 logon ko videsh khaaton ke jariye tex chori kaa doshi paaya gaya tha, jiske baad unke khilaaf yah kanoonee karrwai shuru kii gai he
 At the same time, amidst all-round pressure in the case of action against black money, Switzerland has said that it is cooperating intensely with India
 switsraland kaa yah bayaan aise samay main aayaa he, jabaki donon deshon ke bich is maamle main sambandh 'tanaavpurn' he, kyonki switzraland sarkaar ne kisi churaai gai soochna ke aadhaar aadhaar par bharatiyon ke swiss bank khaaton ke sambandh main koi jaankaree bharat ko dene se inkaar kar diya tha

 Prior to the Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party is working on a strategy to persuade the ruthless allies of the NDA and add new parties
 maharashtra main shivasena ko saadhane or tamilnadu main AIADMK ko apane saath jodne ke baad bijepi uttar pradesh main apni sahyogi apana dal or omprakash rajbhar kii party se saath barkaraar rakhane kii kavayad main jute gai he
 It is believed that on 26 February, the BJP can announce its alliance in the state
 apana dal (es) kii netaa or kendriya mantri anupriya patel ke kade tevar dikhaane or suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke adhyaksh omprakash rajbhar ke gathbandhan se alag hone ke ultimatum ke baad buudhvaar ko mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or soobe ke donon upmukhyamantri dinesh sharma va keshav prasad maury bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se mili
 Let me tell you that the BJP had an agreement in 2014 Lok Sabha elections with Apna Dal (S) in Uttar Pradesh
 bijepi ne apana dal ko 2 siten di thi, jahaan wo jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 At the same time, BJP formed an alliance in the 2017 assembly elections with Omprakash Rajbhar's party
 rajbhar soobe main kam se kam 2 siton kii maang rakhi he
 These include Ghosi and Chandauli parliamentary seats
 in donon siton par bijepi kaa kabja he
 Rajbhar has been rebelling against the Yogi government for the last several days
 is kadi main unhone haal hi main ek mantralay bhi chhod diya tha
 After this, Rajbhar met Amit Shah in Delhi late on Tuesday night
 is dauraan unhone obisi ke aarakshan cote main cote kii maang ko lekar charchaa kii
 However, on February 26, the BJP president will again discuss the Lok Sabha seats
 mana ja rahaa he ki unhen ek loksabhaa seat di ja sakati he
 Apna Dal has also kept the pressure of contesting more than 2 seats in front of BJP in the equation instead of the state
 haal hi main kendriya mantri anupriya patel ne saarvajanik rup se apni naaraazgi jaahir kii thi or piem modi ke kaarykram main shaamil nahin huin thi
 Not only this, Anupriya Patel said in Gonda that we had given time till 20 February to BJP, if it did not happen, their party is free to take its decision
 darasal upi main sapa-basapa gathbandhan or priyanka gandhi ke raajnneeti main dastak ke baad soobe main siyaasi sameekaran kaaphi badalte dikh rahe hai
 In such a situation, the challenge before the BJP is to try its ally
 yahi vajah he ki apana dal or omprakash rajbhar ne apni demand badha di he, aise main dekhnaa he ki bijepi in donon dalon ko kaise sadhakar rakhti he

 This proverb again proved to be true when the younger brother, who was married to the bride of the elder brother, got married on the orders of the court
 vivaah ke baad apni nai-naveli dulhan ko chhodkar haalanki vah phir jail chalaa gaya
 Devanand Paswan, a resident of Bhagwanganj Bazar police station area of saran district, Bihar, was married to Sita, daughter of Dashrath Manjhi, resident of Ashok Nagar, Mufassil police station
 tay tithi ke anusaar buudhvaar ko donon kaa parinay sutara main bandhana tay hua
 But Devananda was unhappy with this marriage and ran away from home
 iske baad donon pakshon main hai-tauba much gai
 Meanwhile, the family members of Devanand proposed marriage to his younger brother to the girl's side
 ladki paksh waalon ne to yah prastaav sweekaar kar liya, lekin samasya yah thi ki devanand kaa chota bhai raviranjan paswan marpet ke ek maamle main chhapra jail main band tha, par donon paksh niraash nahin hue or tay tithi par hi shaadi karne kii thaan lee
 Both parties filed an application in the court requesting Raviranjan's marriage
 nyaayalay ne buudhvaar ko raviranjan ko police kii suraksha main bhejkar vivaah karne kaa aadesh de diya, jiske baad vah ashok nagar muhalle main baraat lekar pahunchaa, jahaan usne sita ke saath agni ke saat phere liye
 Both were tied together with complete pomp and religious ritual
 vivaah ke baad dulhan ke pita dasharath maanjhi ne kaha ki jodiyaan sachmuch bhagwaan hi tay karte hai
 Raviranjan was probably written in the fate of his daughter, so even after the marriage of Devanand was fixed, he married Raviranjan
 udhar, vivaah se khush raviranjan ne kaha ki kisi ladki or uske parijanon ke liye tay vivaah kaa tut janaa behad dukhadaayi hota he
 After the marriage was decided, his elder brother ran away from the house, so why should he be punished by an innocent girl, thinking that he agreed to this marriage
 vivaah ke baad duulhaa bana ravi phir se nyaayik hiraasat main jail chalaa gaya lekin usne bharosa jataayaa ki use jald hi nyaay milegaa or vah phir se sita ke saath apni nai jindagi kii shuruyaat kar sakegaa

 unhone kaha ki iske baad vah somvaar dopaher saadhe 12 baje naseeb jang se milenge

 On the online food website Zomato, a man named Amit Shukla ordered food, but when he came to know through a message that a non-hindu delivery boy was bringing his food, he canceled the order
 iske baad jomato ne rifund karne se inkaar kar diya
 Amit Shukla tweeted the matter, tagging Jomato
 saath hi unhone kaha ki jomato food delivery lene ke liye baadhya nahin kar sakati he
 At the same time, Jomato refused to give a refund, saying that food has no religion

 koi dukandaar yaa online website kisi ko koi khaanaa yaa saamaan kharidne or delivery lene ke liye majaboor nahin kar sakati he
 Law professor Dr Rajesh Dubey says Amit Shukla has the legal right to cancel the food order and Jomato cannot force him to take the food
 haalanki agar amit shukla ne khaanaa kii delivery lene se isliye inkaar kar diya, kyonki delivery bvoy muslim tha, to yah dharm ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav mana ja saktaa he
 The Constitution does not allow discrimination on the basis of religion

 When i resigned after 2014, Modi spoke to me

 We talked for about 15 minutes
 We have had political differences with Deve Gowda Ji but there is no denying that he is among India’s most respected leaders

 Perhaps the minister forgot that the work of Sardar Sarovar Project was going on before the Maheshwar Project, in which the movements of the inconsistencies, corruption and drowning affected people continued, but in order to keep the vote bank of his own assembly, the Minister took 9–9 hours
 Worked till and systematically rehabilitated the people of the constituency
 jabaki is dub kshetra kii jimmedaari ke liye bala bachchan ke jile kaa maamla hone kii baat kah daali
 Answering the question of the government taking any specific and concrete steps after the formation of the Congress government, Sadhau said that we will take decisive steps soon

 The legendary South African all-rounder Jack Kallis has announced his retirement from Test matches, and will play the last Test match of his career from 26 December
 vah philhal test cricket main sabase adhik ran banane vaale ballebaajon kii suchi main chauthe kram par hai, so, aise main kallis jarur chahenge ki vah tisare yaa duusare number par pahunch jaaen
 Indian master blaster Sachin Tendulkar is at the top of the list of batsmen with the most runs in a Test career, who scored 53 in 329 innings of 200 Tests
 78 kii ausat se kul 15,921 ran banaae
 At number two is former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who scored 51 in 287 innings of 168 matches
 85 kii ausat se 13,378 ran thoke
 At the third place in the list is again the name of an Indian Rahul Dravid, who was called as 'the Wall'
 dravid ne apane kariyar main 164 test match khele, jinaki 286 pariyon main unhone 52
 13,288 runs at an average of 31
 inke baad chauthe number par kallis maujuud hai, jinhone ab tak 165 maichon kii 279 pariyon main 55
 Has scored 13,174 runs at an average of 12
 ab is suchi ke mutabik jaik kallis tisare number par maujuud rahul dravid se 114 ran peeche hai, jabaki riki ponting se vah 204 ran peeche hai
 For Kallis, the second and last Test match of the series against India, played on 26 December 2013, is the last time when he can reach not only Dravid, but also Ponting, and reach second in the list
 tisare kram par aane ke liye kallis ko donon pariyon main kul milakar 115 ran banane hai, jabaki duusare sthaan par pahunchane ke liye unhen 205 ran banane honge, jo unke jaise khilaadi ke liye bahut anoothaa karnama nahin he
 The reason for this is that Jack Kallis has an average average
 unhone ab tak 55
 Has scored at an average of 12, which is the second best among players in the 10-hazari club
 srilanka ke kumaar sangakaara (56
 98) has scored runs with better average than them
 vaise, jaik kallis ne apni kharaab form se tang aakar test maichon se sanyas kaa faisla kiya he, or vah pichley teen test maichon main 5, 0, 7, 0, 34 ranon kii paariyaan hi khel sake hai
 So, given such recent performances, it is difficult to say whether he will be able to score 115 or 205 runs in the last two innings of his career, but there is no doubt that it would not be right to tie a great player like him in the boundaries

 unhone kaha ki bijepi rajyapal shashan or baaki vikalpon kii baat kar rahi he, lekin chunaav iske liye nahin hue the
 An NCP spokesman said that anything is possible
 shivasena par naram rukh apanaate hue malik ne kaha ki shivasena ne kaaphi samay se anyaay dekha he or logon ne bhi aisa dekha he
 'shiv Sena believes in Shivaji's ideology' Shivlik said that Shiv Sena believes in Shivaji's ideology and Shivaji never discriminated between Hindus and Muslims, so there is no question of separate ideology
 malik ne ye bhi saaf kiya ki ensipi bijepi kaa kabhi samarthan nahin karegi
 We are also ready to sit in the opposition

 Apart from Sanjay Raut's statement, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that take it in writing, the Chief Minister will belong to Shiv Sena
 iske alaava unhone twit ke jariye bhi bina naam liye bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 This statement of Sanjay Raut has come when he met NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday
 sanjay raut ne twitor par likhaa, ‘sahib! mat paaliye, ahankaar ko itnaa, vakt ke sagar main kai sikandar dub gaye
 Although no one has been named in this tweet, the Shiv Sena leader's gesture is clear that the target is the Bharatiya Janata Party
 bataa den ki guuruuvaar kosharad pavaar se shivasena netaa sanjay raut kii mulaakaat keebataa saamne ai thi
 However, NCP leader Dhananjay Munde said that i do not know about Sanjay Raut's meeting with Sharad Pawar
 kaaphi pehle se unke puraane rishte rahe hai
 He said, there is no question of thinking on the proposal of Shiv Sena, because we have got the mandate to sit in the opposition
 bahumat ke liye 145 seat chahiebta den ki 288 siton vaali maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main shivasena ke 56 or ensipi 54 vidhayak hai
 That means there are only 110 mlas, while the majority needs 145 seats, which is 35 less than the magic number of the majority
 aise main unhen congress ke 44 vidhayakon ke samarthan kii zarurat hogi

 Not giving much weight to the debate between Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma and Pakistan batsman Kamran Akmal during the first T20 cricket match, the captains of both the teams said that it was a minor debate, which ended with a smile on both faces
 Happened
 mangalvaar ko hue is match main ishanth or akmal ko tikhi bahes karte hue dikhaaya gaya or ampiron ne bich-bachaav karte hue inhen alag kiya
 Pakistan won the match by five wickets
 yah bahes us samay hui, jab akmal ko nobal par kaich out hone ke baad noteout qaraar diya gaya, jabaki agali gend ne bhi unhen pareshaani main daalaa
 Soon after, both the players said something to each other in anger and also showed finger to each other
 ant main maidani ampiron or bhartiya khilaadiyon ne bich-bachaav karte hue donon ko alag kiya
 The comments bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne kaha, yah donon ke bich kul galatfahami ke kaaran hua
 The bowler said something else, while the batsman understood something else
 mujhe khushi he ki ishanth ne ballebaaj ko apshabd nahin kahe
 We will try to keep an eye on these things
 pakistan ke captain mohammad hafeez ne kaha ki khilaadiyon ne is mudde ko maidan par hi bhula diya
 He said, we have come here to play competitive cricket and events like this happen

 pakistan ne yah match paanch wicket se jeeta
 The debate took place when Akmal was declared not out after being caught by Noble, while the next ball also troubled him
 iske turant baad donon khilaadiyon ne ek-duusare ko gusse main kuch kaha or ek-duusare ko anguli bhi dikhaai
 In the end, the on-field umpires and Indian players separated the two, intervening
 tippaniyan Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said, this was due to a total misunderstanding between the two
 gendbaaj ne kuch or kaha, jabaki ballebaaj ne kuch or samajha
 i am happy that Ishant did not say abusive words to the batsman
 ham in chizon par najar rakhane kii koshish karenge
 Pakistan captain Mohammad Hafeez said that the players forgot the issue on the field
 unhone kaha, ham yahaan pratispardhi cricket khilne aae hai or is tarah kii ghatnaayen hoti hai
 This is part of the game
 haalanki ishanth or akmal ne ek-duusare kii taraf dekhakar muskuraate hue maidan par hi is mudde kaa ant kar diya

 Sanjay Nirupam of Maharashtra Congress is the only leader who has been opposing Congress alliance with Shiv Sena since the beginning
 hamaare netaaon kaa tark he ki bijepi ko rokane ke liye ham shivasena se haath milaane kaa jokhim uthaa rahe hai
 But how long will the government with 'three spoilers work' will run? Then either BJP will form a government with someone or elections will be held

 He had questioned the Congress by tweeting that by when will the government with these three spoilers work

 The difficulty is that the dream can be divided but not the throne
 un sapanom kii ek daal par rahul baithe hai or duusare par narendra modi, lekin kiskaa sapana puraa hoga?bijepi ye ummid baandhakar baithi he ki modi kaa patta congress ke baag main patjhad laa degaa or congress sochakar baithi he ki rahul kii aandhi jab chalegi to sawan jhakh markar mukaddar main singhaasana likh degaa
 Right now both the BJP and the Congress are going one step ahead and two steps backwards, but as good as the politics games open up
 modi or rahul main ek fark he
 Modi is looking at 14 faces in a move and 114 faces looking at him on Rahul's wish
 sara khel apane-apane sahab ko jaadugar sabit karne kaa he
 But the dreams will be fulfilled only by those who have the key to power and the character of the miracle

 This information has been given in US media news
 al-kaayda pramukh ko maarane ke abhiyaan ke naveenatam akalan ke jaankaar adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki kabhi bhi aisa nahin laga ki laden ne apane bhaagane ke liye koi vishesh yojana bana rakhi thi
 According to a CNN report, sources say that it does not appear that Osama bin Laden made any effort to erase and destroy his documents and computer filled information before entering the premises of the Navy seals commandos
 news network ne ek adhikari ke hawaale se kaha he, aisa lagata he jaise vah puri tarah aashwast tha
 He says, we have got more stuff there than we thought

 The officer said, what does all this mean? This officer was quoted as saying, "how did he (laden) have been living so leisurely and comfortably for so long, with so little security?" CNN says that the Obama administration has not yet reached any such conclusion based on the information received whether or not Laden was getting help from the Pakistani government
 magar yah tay he ki pakistan main alqaida kaa paryaapt sahaayta network tha
 Another US official said that it could take months to extract the results after analyzing intelligence and all other information about Laden's control and the hold of his men in the area
 adhikari ne bataaya, yadi aap alqaida ke siio hon to kabhi aap apana dhyaan ranneeti par to kabhi prabandhan par or kabhi aadamiyon par kendrit karte hai
 Over time he became involved with all these aspects
 is adhikari ke anusaar, yahi vajah he ki prashasan maanata he ki abtabad sthit parisar laden kaa abhiyaan or niyantran centre tha
 However, the authorities dismissed reports that the residence in Abbottabad was not an accommodation for Laden to spend time after retirement

 *** India, led by Virat Kohli, has already booked their seats in the semi-finals of the ICC World Cup
 haalanki bhartiya team ko apana antim lig match aaj shanivaar ko srilanka ke khilaaf khelnaa he
 Captain Kohli has a great chance to try some players sitting on the bench for this match before the big match
 agar ballebaaj mayank agarwal ko antim ekadash main shaamil kiya jaataa he to unke paas 32 saal puraane navjot singh siddhu ke record ko todane kaa shandaar mauka hoga
 In the middle of the World Cup, all-rounder Vijay Shankar was included in the squad, bypassing senior players in his place
 kaha ja rahaa he ki captain viraat kohli or coach ravi shastri ke dabaav ke kaaran hi mayank ko team main rakhaa gaya
 Angry Rayudu, annoyed by his ignorance, suddenly decided to retire
 khaas baat yah he ki mayank ke paas ekadivasiy antarrashtriya match (ODI) khilne kaa koi anubhav nahin he, yani ki unhen vanade main abhi apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kerani he
 After 27 years, if Kohli gives a chance to Mayank in the match against Sri Lanka before the semi-finals in the Maukworld World Cup, he will be the 7th player from India to make his ODI debut in the World Cup
 saath hi 27 saal baad koi bhartiya cricketer world cap se debyue karegaa
 However, the Indian cricketers who started their career from the World Cup have not started well
 ab tak ke 6 khilaadiyon main mahaj navjot singh siddhu hi shandaar pradarshan kar sake hai
 Sidhu's debut in the 1987 World Cup: In the 1987-88 World Cup, batsman Navjot Singh Sidhu got an opportunity to start his ODI career which he also redeemed
 navjot singh siddhu ne apane pehle hi vanade match main australia ke khilaaf shandaar ballebaaji karte hue 79 gendon main 73 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 Sidhu had 4 fours and 5 sixes in this wonderful innings, which was a charismatic innings at that time
 haalanki bharat yah match 1 wicket se haar gaya tha
 This is the best performance by an Indian in the first match of his ODI career through the World Cup
 siddhu ke baad ajay jadeja hi ekmaatr aise bhartiya hai jinhen world cap se vanade kariyar shuru karne kaa mauka mila
 After this, in the next World Cup (1991–92), all-rounder Ajay Jadeja started his international career
 srilanka ke khilaaf match main shaamil to kiye gaye, lekin unhen maidan main utarane kaa mauka nahin mila kyonki barish se yah match dhul gaya tha
 This match could not happen due to continuous rain after the toss
 lekin isi world cap main pakistan ke khilaaf mukaable main apane tisare vanade match main jadeja ne 46 ranon kii shandaar pari kheli thi jisaki badaulat bharat yah match jeetne main kaamyaab rahaa
 The process of defeating Pakistan by Team India in the World Cup started from this match which continues even today
 1975 main 3 bhartiya khilaadiyon ne kiya debyupahale world cap (1975) main hi bhartiya cricket team ke liye khilaadiyon ke vanade kariyar kii shuruyaat ho gai thi
 On June 7, in the match against England, 3 players got the opportunity to start an ODI career for Team India together
 anshuman gaekwad, mohinder amarnath or karsan ghavri ne is match se apane vanade kariyar kaa aagaaj kiya
 However, the performance of these three cricketers was not good and the team lost the match to England by 202 runs
 philhal, england main khele ja rahe world cap main bharat ke khilaaf apana antim match khilne utarane vaali srilankai team ke paas sabase zyada aise khilaadi hai jinhone world cap main kisi match ke saath apane vanade kariyar kaa aagaaj kiya
 21 Sri Lankan players started their ODI careers from the World Cup
 srilanka ke baad world cap main padaarpan ke maamle main westeindies (9) or newjiland (8) kaa number aata he
 The biggest players in the ODI World Cup include Vivian Richards (west Indies), Abdul Qadir and Javed Miandad (pakistan), Tom Moody (australia) and Imran Tahir (south Africa)
 ank talika main sheersh par rahane ke liye bharat ko yah match har haal main jeetna hoga, or dua kerani hogi ki aaj hi khele ja rahe ek anya match main australia dakshin africa se haar jaae
 If this happens, India will go up to 15 points after their win over Sri Lanka and the loss will leave Australia with 14 points, which will make Team India the number one team and they will get a chance to play New Zealand at number four in the semi-finals

 At the age of just 25, captaincy, the absence of a batsman like Michael Clarke, the team's middle order not being in rhythm, and a strong performance in Team India after a strong performance in Adelaide
 
 
 ye sab ve pahalu the, jisane steven smith par asar jarur daalaa hoga, lekin vah bilkul dagamagaae nahin
 He did not take much time to dismiss any doubt on his captaincy
 apni pehali hi pari main unhone dikhaaya ki vah us umr main australian team kii kaman sambhaal sakate hai, jis umr main khilaadiyon kii australian team main jagah bhi nahin banati
 Steven Smith's batting was instrumental in the team's victory in the Adelaide Test
 pehali pari main note out 162 or duusari pari main bhi out hue bina 52 ran banane vaale smith ne siries kii apni teesri pari main behad mushkil paristhitiyon main team ke liye behad ahm shatak banaaya
 In response to the Indian innings in the Brisbane Test, the Australian team's situation was fragile at one time, but Smith not only brought the team out of the crisis, but also brought it into the match
 is dauraan unhone michel johnson ke saath saatven wicket ke liye shatkeey saajhedaari nibhaakar bharat kii badhat lene kii kisi sambhaavna ko khatm kar diya
 Both added 148 runs for the seventh wicket
 johnson ne 93 gendon par 88 ranon kaa yogadan diya, jabaki steven smith 133 ran banaakar out hue
 Smith has scored a century for the sixth time in the last 13 Tests
 smith kii ballebaaji kii ek badi khaasiyat yah he ki vah tej or spin gendbaaji kii samaan sahajata ke saath saamana karte hai
 Steven Smith was first named in the Australian Test team in 2010, replacing spin bowler Nathan Haritz
 tab smith kii pahchaan ek spin gendbaaj ke rup main zyada thi, jo ran bhi bana saktaa tha
 But Smith soon developed himself as a batsman
 beete ek saal kaa unka pradarshan yah bataa rahaa he ki aane vaale dinon main unki dhamak australian hi nahin, vishwa cricket main lambey samay tak kaayam rahegi

 in / Those who had booked flats in Noida Extension received roughly Rs 2,500
 varg foot kii dar bataai gai thi, yani 1,500 vargafoot kaa flats 37
 50 lakhs
 kaa
 The land on which these flats are built is about Rs 800 by the Greater Noida Development Authority
 prati varg meter par kisaanon se kharidi thi or kareeb 8,000 ru
 Was sold to some big builders at the rate of per square meter
 in bade bilderon ne aakhirkaar yahi jameen chote bilderon ko kareeb 21,000 ru
 Per square meter and these builders started building and selling apartments on it
 kalpana kiijie ki agar praadhikaran ne hi is jameen par apartment banaakar unhen bechaa hota to flats kitne main padate? yahaan paanch acre bhukhand kharidne vaale ek builder hisaab lagaakar bataate hai ki ''jo flats 40 lakh ru
 15-20 lakhs
 se bhi kam main padate
 "in fact, the housing boards of the states and the development authorities of the cities have left it to the builders to make housing accessible for all, so every big city is dominated by builders
" aisa bhi nahin he ki praadhikaranon kii sampattiyon kaa koi kharidaar na rahaa ho
 Ghaziabad Development Authority: How many times applications are sought: 61 * Total number of makan-plots-flats: 13,645 How many applicants: 2,21,362 Price: 1 lakh to 87

 * From January 2006 to July 2009 Grater Noida how many times applications are sought: 17 * Total how many houses-plots-flats: 27,673 How many applicants: 3,35,135 Price: Not available * From January 2006 to August 2008 Haryana Urban Development Authority How many applications were asked: 20 * Total number of houses-plots-flats: 23,058 How many applicants: 20,73,918 Price: 2009 to January 2009 Has sought this supply and supply of their houses-flats-plots from some authorities through the Right to Information Act The accounts have been calculated: Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA), known for poor quality and economic mismanagement, carried out schemes for plots-houses-flats 61 times from 2006 to 2009
 aisa nahin he ki usne hajaaron logon ko bhukhand-makaan maalik bana diya ho kyonki kai baar to usne mahaj 1 yaa 2 unit ke liye vigyaapan nikaale
 It sold a total of 13,645 units in 61 bars for which 2
 21 lakh se zyada logon ne aavedan kiye the
 It is said about the GDA that whenever it needs money, it issues advertisements for the allotment of some vacant plots-houses-flats so that some money comes from the registration amount
 iske upaadhyaksh narendra kumaar choudhary kehete hai, ''hamaari yojanaon par logon kaa rispance acha nahin aata
 There are many reasons for that
 lekin garibon ke liye to rihaaish ham hi uplabdh karaate hai
 "obviously, the poor quality of houses and flats built by GDA is a major reason for this low response, although Chaudhary does not believe so
 lekin kam rispance kii aisi sthiti har praadhikaran main nahin rahati
 For example, 20 out of the same period for only 23,058 units in different cities of Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA)
 73 lakh logon ne aavedan kiye
 At the same time, in Greater Noida, applications were sought for 27,673 units and 3 in 17 times during this period
 35 lakh se zyada logon ne aavedan kiye
 5 for the 5,238 flats evacuated by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) in the year 2008
 67 lakh logon ne aavedan kiye the or pichley saal usne 16,237 flaton ke liye aavedan maange to 7
 55 lakh people applied
 noida kii 2004 kii vivaadit yojana jiske tahat 1,250 bhukhand aavantit hone the, ke liye 1
 67 lakh people had applied
 vaise, in aavedakon main bhi saare jaruratmand hi nahin, kuch kaarobaari bhi hote hai par isse ek andaaj to lagata hi he ki maang kitni zyada he or aapurti kitni kam
 Due to this, the business of land-house-flat has become the most profitable business and due to the condition that has been created, investors are buying more and less needy people
 praadhikaranon ne bilderon ke saath milakar is jarurat kii tizaarat ko badhaava diya he
 In Noida, where the plot of plot-flat-house is often embroiled in controversies, after 2004, not a single scheme has been launched for the common people

 The report titled Expanding Housing Finance to the Underserved South Asia states that 2 in India
 70 karod makaanon kii kami sirf shahari kshetra main he
 This requirement is estimated at 7 crore houses across the country
 yah swaabhaavik hi he ki makaan-bhukhand-flats muhaiyaa karaane main nijee bilderon kii bhoomika bad gai he
 But many people are in the role of mere middlemen who buy land from the authorities and sell it to small builders at an expensive price
 chote builder use sidhe aam logon ko bechate hai yaa phir property dealer thok main book karakar unhen aam kharidaaron ko bechate hai
 In this way, the chain of people benefiting from the business of housing needs of the common people is long
 centre sarkaar ke ek karmchaaree ramakant singh jo greater noida ekstansion main kai baar flats dekhne gaye par book nahin kara paae, kehete hai, ''bilderon ke flaton kii keemat dekhte hai to andaja lag jaataa he ki bichauliyon kii badi taadaad kii vajah se hi 10 lakh ru
 60 Lakhs costing less than Rs
 main bik rahe hai
 This shows that in whose pocket the rest of the money is going
 ''nijee kshetra kii bhoomika ko kam karke nahin aanka ja saktaa
 Atul Garg, who built and sells a large number of flats in many areas of Ghaziabad, says, "the houses the GDA provided to the people in Ghaziabad must have provided at least 100 times that of the private sector
 logon ko sarkari agenciyon ke karaae gaye nirmaan kaaryon kii gunvattta par yakeen hi nahin he
 The price difference is huge
 masalan, greater noida ne pichley saal aam logon ko omicron-teen sector main jo flats aavantit kiye the, unki keemat kareeb 30 lakh ru
 The same size flat built by the builders was around 50 lakhs
 ke hai
 This difference is huge for the needy people
 logon kii chahat kaa phayda bainkon ne bhi uthaanaa sikh liya he or aavedakon ko puri kii puri panjikaran raashi karj dekar kamai karne kaa sutara kai bainkon ne apana liya he
 Authorities and housing development councils have even handed over the business of cooperative housing development to the builders and now it is very difficult and expensive to get land by forming a cooperative society
 khayr, kuch praadhikaranon main kai thos prayaas bhi hue hai
 Just two years ago, Mukesh Meshram, vice-chairman of the Lucknow Development Authority, pulled out plans for small flats instead of allotting large plots, so people broke up to buy
 shraam kehete hai, ''bade bhukhndon ke aavantiyon kaa hamane ek adhyayan karaayaa to pataa chalaa ki ye paise se paisa banane kaa jariya maatr hai
 The needy people make very few houses on such a big plot, there is a shortage of land anyway
 isliye hamane faisla kiya ki bade bhukhand nahin aavantit karenge
 "obviously, if every citizen wants to be a landlord, then the authorities need to adopt a similar policy
 gajiabad kii vaishali jaisi coloniyon main jahaan jidie ne bade-bade bhukhand logon ko makaan banane ke liye die the, unhone bilderon ko bech die or unhone inhen par kai flats banaakar vahaan kii buniyadi suvidhaon ko tahas-nahas kar daalaa
 However, the need of the house has become business and the common man's dream of becoming a landlord has become a costly dream
 lihaaja yah jaruri he ki logon kii awasaiya jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye bane praadhikaran apni ranneeti par punarvichaar karen or bichauliyon kii bhoomika kam karke keemton par niyantran rakhen

 Lalu Yadav organized Parivartan rally in Bihar, but he himself reached Gandhi Maidan with a delay of about three hours
 haalanki wo jaise hi manch par pahunche argedy kaaryakartaaon kaa josh dekhne yogya tha
 In this rally called by Lalu, huge number of RJD workers gathered in the ground despite the harsh sunlight
 is dauraan lalu ke donon bete tej pratap or tejaswini ne manch se gandhi maidan main maujuud kaaryakartaaon kaa abhivadan kiya
 Former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi and Badi Misa Bharti are also present to participate in the rally along with Lalu Yadav

 If there was a time when Bihar's power was on Lalu's footsteps, Lalu would not go to the streets without sleep, but now the situation has changed, for years the pleasant shade of power has not been in Lalu's luck
 lalu se bairan hui satta nitish ke changul se chhootane ko bhi taiyaar nahin, isliye lalu ko ab mehnat kerani pad rahi he

 60 karod, del sten Congress General Secretary Shakeel Ahmed on Wednesday raised controversy with his statement of 'muslim' terrorist
 ahamed ke bayaan par bijepi ne hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki congress desh ko sampradayik aadhaar par baantne kaa prayaas kar rahi he or use iske liye maafee maangani chahie
 Ahmed tweeted, "thankfully! Chhota Rajan and Anoop Chetia are not Muslims
" agar ve muslim hote to un donon ko lekar modi sarkaar ne kaa rukh alag hi hota
 Taking a dig at the Congress leader, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that Ahmed has made a very vile and embarrassing statement and has tried to distinguish terrorists on religious grounds as well
 Thankfully Chhota rajan&anup chetia(ulfa) are not Muslims
 Had they been Muslims Modi govt would have a different narrative altogether
 — Shakeel Ahmad (@ahmad_shakeel)november 18, 2015'modi sarkaar kii dohari niti ujagar karne kii koshish'bayaan par vivaad khadaa hone ke baad ahamed ne kaha ki vah kevalatankwadake mudde par bijepi or modi sarkaar ke dohare mandandon or dohari baton ko ujagar karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 BJP, besieged the Congress, said, "congress veteran Shakeel Ahmed has given a very bad statement
 yah sharmnaak bayaan he
 The Congress has divided the society on the basis of Hindu and Muslim for narrow political gains
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘congress ne samaaj main vot bank banaaya he or aaj ve aatankwaadiyon main bhidharm ke naam par antarkarne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 They are creating a distinction between a Hindu terrorist and a Muslim terrorist
 ’paatra ne kaha ki kuch din pehle congress ke hi manishankar ayyar paris main aies ke hamalon par safai dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Today there is such a statement from Ahmed
 congress kya chaahati he? unhone kaha, ‘or kisi ko nahin balki congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko congress party main dekhe ja rahe is chalan par safai deni chahie
 They should apologize
 ’'bijepi netaa ne kaha tha sabhi aatankwaadi musalmaan hai'shakeel ahamed ne kaha, ‘agar ve muslim hote to bijepi kahati ki congress sarkaar yaa upie sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar nahin kiya or desh main isliye waapas nahin laai kyonki ve muslim hai
 They used to say that Congress and UPA are trying to do vote bank politics like this
 isliye maine yah bayaan diya
 i have tried to highlight the dual attitude of the Modi government and the BJP
 ’ aatankwaad kaa koi dharm nahin hone kii baat kabool karte hue ahamed ne kaha ki endie ke ek netaa ne, jo ab mantri hai, kuch din pehle sansad main kaha tha ki sabhi musalmaan aatankwaadi nahin hai lekin sabhi aatankwaadi musalmaan hai
 At the same time, the religious leader came down the road opposing the statement of the Congress leader
 unhone kaha ki congress netaa ko apane bayaan par maafee maangani chahie
 These days, social media is becoming the biggest tool for spreading rumors
 is plateform kaa izaad logon ko ekadusre se jodne ke liye or samaaj main melmilaap badhaane ke liye kiya gaya tha lekin kuch logon kii dooshit maansikta ke chalate yah durbhaavna or vaimnasyta failaane kaa hathiyaar banataa ja rahaa he
 Realizing this, the Modi government at the center has made preparations to crack down on those who spread propaganda using social media
 ummid he ki kendra sarkaar jald hi nai soshal media policy laa sakati he
 The central government is now preparing to introduce a new social media policy to crack down on the anti-country propaganda run through Facebook, whatsapp, Twitter, Instagram and other social media platforms
 22 june ko is par grih mantralay main ek badi baithak hui jisamen is plan ko kaise laana he usko lekar meeting kii gai
 According to Home Ministry sources, officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs and Central Security Agencies were present in this regard
 soshal media policy ko lekar hui is meeting main kai muddon par charchaa kii gai he
 In which it was also discussed that at the present time only some 'doos' and 'donters' are present in social media to stop anti India propaganda
 isko kaise shashakt or prabhavi karnaa hoga is par bhi charchaa hui he
 How to tighten the legal grievances on propaganda spreading propaganda on social media, there was also discussion on whether to bring a law for the separate anti-india propagandists or to change the existing law and strengthen it
 vajah ye he ki abhi jo karrwai aise logon par hoti hai, uske liye sirf IT act or IPC ke tahat hi hoti hai
 But there is no direct reference to social media in both these laws
 aane vaale dinon main centre sarkaar is naesoshal media policyko lekar or bhi meeting kar sakati he uske baad hi tay hoga ki kaise is policy ko laana he
 According to information received from the sources, after the preparation of the minusts of meeting, the entire policy will be placed before the Home Minister

 Anti-social elements joined the peasant movement, which carried out the incident
 congress upaadhyaksh maamle main raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 Bhupendra Singh questioned that when farmers were protesting for the last six days, where was Tabrahul Gandhik? He claimed that the situation is now under control
 maamle kii nyaayik jaanch ke aadesh die hai, taaki kisaanon par firing karne vaale pulicekarmiyon kii pahchaan kii ja sake
 In a special conversation from Aaj Tak, he said that this is a complete administrative failure
 agar prashasan samay par satark ho jaataa, to aisi ghatana nahin hoti
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan had accepted all the demands of the farmers three days in advance

 uttar pradesh ke unnav kii rape peedita, jo teen din pehle hue sadak haadase main gambhir rup se zakhmi hone ke baad se zindagi or maut ke bich jhul rahi he, or uske parivaar kaa aarope he ki yah accident rape ke aaropee jail main band BJP vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ne hi karavaaya tha, ke maamle main saamne aayaa he ki peedita ke parivaar dwaara is cese ko uttar pradesh se baahar sthanantarit karne ke liye di gai arzi supreme court main lambit he
 The victim and her family wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of the country (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi about the threats being received from Kuldeep Singh Sengar and those sent by him
 unka aarope tha ki un par cese waapas lene ke liye bahut zyaada dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 The CJI has directed the apex court registry to file all the information related to the letter
 is khat ko bjp-shasit uttar pradesh (UP) main is cese kii tafteesh main kii ja rahi deree ke saboot ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Significantly, the Yogi Adityanath government of UP has been accused of taking a soft stance on Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who was an MLA four times earlier
 peedita kaa aarope he ki kuldeep singh senger or uske sahaayakon ne varsh 2017 main uske saath rape kiya tha, jab vah unke paas naukari maangane gai thi
 She made her allegations public in April 2018, when she threatened that if the police did not register her case, she would commit suicide outside Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's residence in Lucknow
 isse kuch hi din pehle, peedita ke pita ko kuldeep singh senger ke bhai atul ne peeta bhi tha, or peedita ke buree tarah zakhmi hue pita kii madad karne ke sthaan par police ne unhen hi hathiyaar rakhane ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya tha
 The next day after the victim's allegations were made public, her father died in police custody
 is ghatana ke janaakrosh fail gaya, jiske baad atul senger ko hatya ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya
 Kuldeep Singh Sengar was also arrested in April 2018 only after the outbreak of public anger
 may, 2018 main elahabaad hoicourt ne maamle kii sunwaayee ko POCSO court se CBI kii lakhanu sthit vishesh adaalat main sthanantarit kar diya tha
 Two months later, the CBI filed a charge sheet against Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his assistant Shashi Singh under various laws, including stringent laws for sexual offenses with minors
 CBI adaalat ne july, 2018 main chargeshit par sangyaan liya, lekin uske baad se cese main koi pragati nahin hui he
 When the Supreme Court last year ordered to set up fast-track courts for cases against mps-mlas, the Uttar Pradesh government constituted a special court on August 21, 2018
 lekin is cese main sunwaayee ek saal se bhi adhik samay se shuru nahin ho pai he, kyonki yahi tay nahin ho paaya he ki sunwaayee CBI kii vishesh adaalat main hi jari rahe, yaa cese ko saansadon-vidhayakon ke khilaaf sunwaayee ke liye gathit adaalat main sthanantarit kiya janaa chahie
 On April 15 this year, the transfer of Judge Vatsal Srivastava of the special CBI court was also done to Gorakhpur, which is coincidentally the hometown of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 iske baad pichley teen maheene se sunwaayee adaalat main bina jaj ke hi lambit he
 The staggering aspect is that the trial of the case has not started yet, and the court does not even have a judge, but taking suo motu cognizance, the Allahabad High Court, which ordered the CBI inquiry, recorded the statement of Gopal Chaturvedi, the amicus curiae (courtmitra) 'the investigation has been completed, the police report (chargesheet) has been filed, and the charges have also been framed, and the trial is on
 
 
 'philhal unnav cese kisi adaalat yaa jaj kii gairmaujuudagi main lambit he
 NDTV has requested the CBI to respond to the delay in any aspect of the case, but no response has been received from the investigating agency at present
