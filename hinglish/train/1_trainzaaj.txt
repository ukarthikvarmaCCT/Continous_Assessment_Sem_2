 com / esjbysigfl Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Prasad said on Wednesday that his fast for not opposing the Nitish Kumar government for six months has come to an end and he will now visit the villages of Bihar and open the poll of the present government
 patna main party ke kaaryakarta sammelan ke baad patrakaron se charchaa karte hue lalu ne kaha, nitish kumaar ke vidhansabha chunaav main jeetne ke baad maine kaha tha ki chah maah tak main unka koi virodh nahin karuunga
 That is why i was living in Delhi
 ab chah maheene se zyada kaa samay biit gaya he
 He said that during this time the illusion was also spread that he was sitting in Delhi to get the post of minister
 unhone rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) par aarope lagaaya ki vah shadyantra kar anya partiyon ke netaaon par dore daal rahaa he
 However, he also said that no party's existence ends
 prasad ne nitish kumaar ko ahankaar main duube hone kii baat kehete hue kaha ki vartmaan sarkaar main ghotaale hi ghotaale hai
 He accused Nitish of giving the land of Bihar State Industrial Development Authority (biada) to his favorites at a quarter to one price and demanded that it be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki e raja kii tarah nitish ne bhi jameen ko 'pehle aao, pehle paao' kii tarah baant diya
 The CAG report has also proved how miscreant the state is
 unhone sabhi ghotaalon kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii maang kii
 Prasad said that there is anger among the people of Bihar and now he will go to the villages
 unhone kaha ki rajd oktober main 'patna march' nikaalegi
 One of the most difficult tasks in the world is to be a boy, because many times, because of being just a boy, you have to listen to the mistakes that you have never made
 aap ro nahin sakate, zyada der tak biimaar nahin rah sakate, by difolt aapaki handriting kharaab hoti he, har chauthe din khud kii shakl ko chhure se ghisna hota he, bas-train main seat khaali hone par bhi nahin baith sakate
 But the biggest problem with all this is when choosing a profile picture on Facebook, as well as choosing different photos for whatsapp and other seven-day messaging apps
 darasal samasya isliye shuru hoti he ki aap photoshop chaahakar bhi istemaal nahin kar sakate, ladkon kaa ye aghoshit sa niyam he ki awww-a xxrep 4 w kii tarah yah bhi kanyaon ke liye chhod diya gaya he badale main contrast jarur thodaa-gata badha liya jaataa he, photoaditing ke naam par ladkon kaa sirf photo blike and white karnaa yaa border lagane kaa haq banataa he
 You do not want to look too fat in the photo, lean is a curse, you cannot think of putting a photo without bathing or growing a beard or a mustache, meaning that twenty-five days of the month went waste, as well as being bathed-washed is dangerous because the next One can wash it standing upright by writing 'aaj naha liya be, kitte saal me paani daala aalsi, insaan lag raha hai'
 veshbhusha ke saath sthaan kaa dhyaan bhi rakhana hota he, aap mandir ke saamne dikh jaaen to 'dudapa' bhrasht ho saktaa he, paan ke tapare yaa peeche 'thandi or draft bear yahaan milti he' se bhi dur janaa hota he, or to or photo ke saath agar jeepies lokation bhi aa jaae to aap funs sakate hai kyonki chirula main baithe-baithe aapane phone par aadhi frendlist ko pune main hone kii khabar de rakhi he
 You cannot put a photo in front of the PVR or else the garl-friend whom you shrugged off with the excuse of loose motion, can attack with a logistic-kumuk
 kai baar to photo lete vakt aapako chehre kaa ek bhaag chupa kar ardhaphotoeshwar vaala poj dena pad jaataa he kyonki duusari aankh par chauraahey main bhidane ke kaale nishaan jo hai, aap maasoom nahin dikh sakate kyonki use aapkaa maior luk pasand he, or maior luk main koi friend request except nahin karti
 And the saddest thing is that because of being a boy, you cannot even take a selfie with your lips folded, and even if a picture of a pose has come there? Even after tagging 49 people, there is nothing to be found more than ten likes and nine insulting comments

 tippaniyan The Ayurvedic medicine developed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) reduces the risk of heart attack by up to fifty percent in BGR-34 diabetic patients
 is dawa ke kareeb 50 fisadi sevenkartaaon main glycosilated haemoglobin kaa str niyantrit paaya gaya
 This has been revealed in research
 jarnal of tadrishanal and complimentry medicine ke taaja ank main isse jude shodh ko prakashit kiya gaya he
 According to the report, BGR-34 is already established as an effective drug for diabetics
 maujuuda allopathy dawaaen sharkara kaa str to kam karti hai lekin isse judi anya dikkaton ko thik nahin kar paati hai
 BGR has also been seen to overcome these problems
 jarnal ke anusaar bhartiya chikitsa anusandhan parishad (isiemr) ke disha-nirdeshon ke tahat ek aspataal main 64 marijon par chaar maheene tak is dawa kaa pareekshan kiya gaya he
 During this period, two types of results were revealed
 80 fisadi tak marijon ke sharkara ke str main kami darj kii gai
 The average sugar level before starting the drug was 196 (empty stomach), which decreased to 129 mgdl after four months
 jabaki bhojan ke baad yah str 276 se ghatakar 191 mdiel rah gaya
 These results are good but this type of result also gives many allopathic medicines
 siesaiaar ne bijiaar-34 ke nirmaan kii anumati emil pharmaceutical ko de rakhi he
 Dry hair remains irritated, not the reason? According to the report, another encouraging result is about glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c)
 30-50 fisadi marijon main is dawa ke seven se glycosilated haemoglobin niyantrit ho gaya jabaki baaki marijon main bhi iske str main das fisadi tak kii kami ai thi
 Indeed, the excess of glycosylated hemoglobin in the blood causes blood -linked diseases to the blood vessels
 jisamen heart atake hona or daure padana pramukh he
 Both these cases are increasing rapidly in diabetes patients

 Its function is to transmit oxygen
 lekin jab haemoglobin main sharkara kii maatra ghul jaati he to haemoglobin kaa kaary baadhit ho jaataa he ise hi glycosilated haemoglobin kehete hai
 Its effect lasts for several months

 Deepak Thakur left the show in the middle taking a prize money of 20 lakhs
 salmaan khan ne is baat kii ghoshnaa bhi kii, ye ab tak kaa sabase bada exit amount he
 But Salman Khan made the biggest mistake here, it was revealed by a contestant
 darasal, top 3 contestant ke liye salmaan ne ek mushkil task diya tha
 In a briefcase, the largest exit amount ever was kept
 jo bhi contestant batan dabaakar brifces lene sabase pehle pahunchataa, vah sho se baahar ho jaataa
 There was an amount of about 20 lakhs in this briefcase
 salmaan khan kii baat sunne ke baad kisi ne bajer nahin dabaaya
 But after a while Deepak Thakur left the show after pressing the buzzer
 salmaan khan ne deepak ko unke faisle ke liye badhai di or kaha, aapane sabase badi prise mani jiti he

 preetam ke is twit par srisanth kii patni bhubaneshwari ne bhi twit karte hue kaha he ki ye to creative team kii galati he
 i was saying this myself

 i knew both of them have earned a lot of name due to their work
 yahi vajah he ki mujhe 80 fisadi ummid thi main jeet saktaa hum
 But knew inside, the front is more powerful than me
 haa agar baat sirf meri hoti to main phir paison ko nahin chunata
 But it was known that my family's financial condition is not good
 parivaar kaa khyaal or jimmedaari thi
 So it felt right to leave the show with money at the end
 "deepak ne kaha "apane faisle se mujhe bahut khushi he
 i am sure that my family and my village are with this decision
 " bataa den deepak thakur ke sho chhodane ke faisle ko salmaan khan ne bhi saraahaa
 He told Deepak that you were third in terms of voting

 In Delhi, despite the public support of mlas, Ministers in the Aam Aadmi Party government's decision not to use the red light car and the Supreme Court and the High Court's rebuke in this case, the Government of UP will not get laughter

 a three-member High Powered Committee has also been constituted for this
 lekin soobe main rutabe or kad kaa pratik laal tathaa neeli batti kaa moh chhodane ke liye koi taiyaar nahin he

 The arrest of leftist thinkers and the raid on their bases has heated up politics

 On the arrest of leftist thinkers, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has said, 'there is room for only one NGO in India, named RSS
 baaki saare enjio ko taala laga do
 Put all the activists in jail and shoot those who raise their voice against it
 nae bharat main aapkaa swaagat he
 'dalit thinker and Ambedkar Mahasabha president Ashok Bharti said that the Modi government is unable to tolerate any ideology other than Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has led to these arrests

 Ratan Lal said that the Modi government wants to make the National Antinational an issue through these arrests
 is desh main samvidhan ijaajat detaa he ki vampanthi vicharadhara apana sakate hai
 Even after this, the government has reservations
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke khilaaf bolne kaa matlab desh ke khilaaf bolnaa nahin he
 BSP president Mayawati said that the government is plotting to intimidate people who voice for the rights of Dalits, tribals and backward
 modi sarkaar ne jis tarah buddhijiviyon or saamaajik kaaryakartaaon giraftaar kiya he usase saaf jaahir he ki desh kaa loktantr khatre main he

 white house main samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan obama ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya, mujhe nahin lagata ki snowden koi deshbhakt tha
 In response to a question, Obama said, the truth is that Snowden has been charged with three counts of fraud
 agar use vastav main lagata he ki vah sahi he, to har aam america naagarik kii tarah vah yahaan aa saktaa he, apane vakil ke saath adaalat ke samaksh pesh ho saktaa he or apana paksh rakh saktaa he
 The US president said, "if anyone is concerned that this is the only way to get information to the public, i signed an executive order to provide whistle blower protection to the intelligence community before Snowden disclosed the information
" 
 tippaniyan Obama said, it has become such an influence in the American people and the whole world, as if we are just collecting information about everyone and we are enjoying it very much
 unhone kaha, aisa nahin he
 Our laws prohibit us from monitoring the American people without warrants
 moolbhoot siddhanton kaa paalan sunishchit karne ke liye paryaapt suraksha pranaliyaan rakhi gai hai
 Earlier, Obama's Democratic Party MP John Lewis compared Snowden to Mahatma Gandhi, saying the disputed whistle blower was 'non-violently' committing civil disobedience
 (chitra parichay : edward snowden kii file photo) During a White House press conference, Obama told reporters, "I don't think Snowden was a patriot
" ek sawaal ke jawaab main obama ne kaha, sachai yah he ki snowden par dhokhadhadi ke teen aarope lagaae gaye hai
 If he really feels that he is right, then like every ordinary American citizen, he can come here, appear before the court with his lawyer and present his side

 However, sunlight blossomed in many places during the day

 Today's minimum temperature in Delhi is 14

 Another video has surfaced of violent clashes between lawyers and police in Tis Hazari Court
 is video se sanket miltaa he ki us din mahila disipi ke saath kya hua
 She was in uniform
 unke aasapaas police ke jawan vardi main the
 This video is depressing
 agar ek disipi is tarah se ghir jaaen, un par is tarah hamalaa ho jaae to phir aam aadmi kahaan surakshit he or kisase surakshit he
 Of course all this is a matter of investigation but the court has not stopped its reporting
 video main jo dikh rahaa he wo bhayanak he
 Where will the justice be found when the premises of the courts are not safe? dilli main yah ghatana hui he, supreme court se koi awaz nahin ai he
 First you see the fire in this video
 aag kii lapat achaanak tej upar uthati he
 Some police personnel are running towards that side
 lekin bheed ugr ho jaati he to jawan apni jaan bachaate hue bhaag rahe hai
 They are under attack
 kuch der baad vakil bhi bhaagate nazar aa rahe hai or police bhi
 Two women go ashore
 inamen se kaale kot main do mahila vakil bhi hai or or ek mahila saadhaaran libaas main hai
 All three look at the crowd
 phir sabhi bheed kii taraf dekhte hai
 Some people are running away with clothes on their mouths
 kuch police vaale bhaage aa rahe hai
 Runs fast
 baayin taraf dekhie
 a van is parked and flames are rising on the shore
 vahaan par police ke jawan bhaagate nazar aa rahe hai lekin vakil javaanon ko pakad kar maarthe hai
 a young man gets trapped
 use maaraa jaataa he
 a man in a white shirt catches a policeman and kills him
 jawan haath nahin uthaata he
 He frees the hand and runs to the way some soldiers are covering the DCP
 zaahir he jawan apane disipi ko cover kar rahe hai jaan par khelkar
 What is happening with DCP can be guessed
 tabhi cover karne vaale javaanon par vakil chaaron taraf se tut padate hai
 This is all visible from the front
 disipi camere main dikh rahi hai
 His head is covered so that he can be protected from injury
 unke peeche aa rahe ek jawan ko vakil khinch letaa he
 Echo standing next to the car starts killing him
 vah jawan phir chhudaa kar disipi ko cover karne bhaagta he
 The young man kills but does not raise his hand
 vah saamne aa chuki disipi ke peeche aa jaataa he tab phir uskaa koi haath pakad khinch kar maarane lagata he
 Kills a soldier hard
 aap safed shart main ek shaks ko eent kaa tukdaa uthaate dekhenge
 With a brick he comes in front but does not drive, but behind him a man runs a brick
 tab tak disipi haath chhudaa kar peeche mudati hai
 But the coverr does not leave them
 wo aage le jaataa he
 The lawyers are broken on a woman officer and are killing them like this
 police kii goli se vakil ghayal hue hai
 He is being investigated, but this video tells what was the situation in Tis Hazari Court
 mahila ipies or wo bhi disipi ko bheed ne gher liya tha
 What happened to them will be clear only when they file a complaint
 magar yah video bataata he ki hamalaa kitna bhayanak tha
 If the Delhi Police soldiers had not covered their DCP, then they could have been victims of violence
 aap video main dekhenge ki jawan maar kha rahe hai magar unki pehali praathamikta he ki kisi tarah disipi ko surakshit nikaalnaa
 Those soldiers are being attacked from behind, but in response no jawan is seen even running a punch
 sab disipi ko bachaa rahe he
 All this has happened in the court premises
 aage ham court kaa haal bataaenge
 One of the hallmarks of India's judicial system
 yahaan ke mukademe kai pidiyon tak chalate hai
 The good thing is that there has been some improvement
 bharat ke adhinsth nyaayalayon main mukademon ke niptaare main ausat samay ab sirf 5 saal lagata he
 Only 5 years have to wait for justice
 bharat ke garib or aam naagarik ek mukademe ke niptaare kaa paanch saal intazaar karte hai, nyaay par bharose kaa isse bada udhaaharan kya ho saktaa he
 There are 23 lakh cases that are 10 years old
 backlog vaale mukademon kaa 45 pratishat upi maharashtra, bengal bihar or gujarat main he
 This is just a delay figure
 mukademe ko court tak pahunchane ke liye police system kii bhi haalat kharaab he
 Somewhere the posts are vacant and elsewhere the posts are reduced

 In this context, for the first time an India Justice report has come
 yah report guuruuvaar ko dilli main jari hui
 Institutions such as the Law Center for Legal Policy, Center for Social Justice, Common Cause, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, Daksh, Tata Institute of Social Science Endeavor, with the help of Tata Trusts, have conducted research on the system of judiciary for 18 months

 To see what was done to implement the policy and policy of improving access to justice and justice in the states
 bajet dekha he, yah bhi dekha he ki court kachhari system main kitne log hai, kitne log nahin hai
 Only then it has come to know that India's justice system is in a bad condition
 agar is samasya ko ham bahes ke centre main nahin laaenge to sari baaten hawa hawaii ho jaaengi
 That is why it is easy to implicate someone in a fake case, stall lawsuits and ruin life

 Which improved in 2014 to 17 million people
 5 jaj hue
 According to the India Justice Report, 18 states with a population of over 1 crore have a judge on a population of 50,000
 jo bahut hi kam he
 In the year 2016-17, the number of judges in a single high court or subordinate court was not complete
 18 bade or madhyam aakaar ke rajyon main har hoicourt main 25 pratishat jaj kam the
 Out of these 18 states, more than 25% of the posts of subordinate courts in 6 states are vacant
 bharat main kul 23,754 jaj hone chahie lekin kareeb 4000 jaj kam hai
 If all the posts are filled then 4071 court room will be required
 sochie is haalat main kya nyaay miltaa hoga
 How much pressure will there be on the judges
 hamase adhinsth court ke jaj steshnari tak kii samasya bataate rahete hai
 More than 30 percent of the posts in the subordinate courts of Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand and UP are vacant
 bihar ke adhinsth nyaayalayon main kareeb 40 pratishat cese aise hai jo paanch saal puraane hai
 Not only this, the India Justice Report has ranked the courts for the first time in 18 states
 kis rajya kii nyaayavyavastha behatar he
 Uttar Pradesh as usual has the last rung in this
 18 wein number par he
 Bihar is one notch above UP
 17wein number par he
 Jharkhand is at number three from the bottom, at number 16
 maharashtra kaa sthaan pehla he or kerala kaa doosraa
 Tamil Nadu is the third place and Punjab is the fourth
 is report main nyaaypalika ke tantra kaa dilachasp adhyayan kiya gaya he jisase pataa chalata he ki ek baar court main funsane ke baad koi nikal kyon nahin paata he
 Posts in 22 percent of the police department are vacant
 zaahir he na thik se jaanch hogi na chargeshit behatar hogi
 33 percent of the posts in the jail are vacant
 court main 20 pratishat pad khaali hai
 All these figures are for 2016-17
 halaat behatar hue honge, isaki ummid nahin kii ja sakati
 Gujarat is the only state where police, jail and court posts have been reduced in 5 years
 jharkhand main paanch saalon main khaali padon kii sankhya badi he
 That is, not admitted
 68 pratishat qaidi under trial hai jinke cese main jaanch yaa trial puri nahin hui he
 Only 13 states where the number of under trials has been reduced in 5 years
 is report ke anusaar kisi bhi rajya main anusuchit jati, janajati va anya pichde virgon kaa kota puri tarah nahin bharaa gaya he
 Only Karnataka is where the entire quota has been filled but even there, 4% seats of the Scheduled Castes quota remain vacant
 bajet kii baari kami zyaadaatar rajyon main he
 The number of police posts in 10 states has been cut
 jabaki aabaadi badi he
 There are 24 states where 20 percent of the posts of police officers are vacant
 nyaay main bhi deree or berojgaare main bhi badhottaree
 If these posts were filled, unemployment would be removed and justice would also be available in time

 susheel mahapatra ne supreme court ke purv justise madan bi lokur se baat kii
 In the case of pollution, the focus is on Delhi but the rest of the cities of India are also covered with garbage
 naaliyon kii safai par kharch hue karodon rupee kahaan gaye kisi ko pataa nahin kyonki gandagi to vahiin kii vahiin he
 As a result, the disease is spreading in such a way that the news does not reach the rest of India
 supreme court ke justise arun mishra or justise deepak gupt ko yah video dekhnaa chahie
 It is possible to know what is happening to the mountains of garbage in the areas adjacent to Delhi
 yah uttarakhand ke rudrapur kaa he
 Our audience Kamaljeet has made and sent it
 traching ground main das dinon se kachra jal rahaa he
 The only way to deal with this has survived is that people start demanding that they be removed from our place and taken to some other place, but forget that people live there too
 iske liye alag zamin mil gai he magar yah kooda hatega kaise or vahaan jayega to pehle hi din bhar degaa
 If there is no litter space left in the trucking ground, then the garbage is being lit next to the highway
 amar ujaalaa ne likhaa he ki agar isi tarah yah dadhakta rahaa to rudrapur kii haalat dilli jaisi ho jaaegi
 Photographs of garbage mountains in Haldwani, Nainital, Rudrapur should be submitted to the Supreme Court
 nigamon se yah kaam nahin hoga
 Had it happened, it would have happened
 ab dekhnaa chahie ki kya supreme court kii sakhti se kuch sudhaar hoga
 This has happened in Rudpur with a population of 3 lakhs
 land phil main aag kaa laganaa acha nahin hota he
 This is also a big reason in air pollution
 kisaanon kii taraf to sabakaa dhyaan jaataa he magar chote chote shaharon main jal rahe in land phil kii sud koun legaa
 Just look at Kanpur
 7 november ko kanpur kaa air quality index 366 tha jo bahut karaab mana jaataa he
 The Air Quality Index on November 5 was 444
 puure hafte kanpur kaa air quality index bahut kharaab rahaa he
 In Kanpur, the number of dengue patients has increased to 1200
 kanpur main har din 1300 metric ton kachra nikalataa he
 This plant of Solid Waste Management in Bhuti is able to dispose of half the waste
 is pahaad ko dekhakar aap soch sakate hai ki dilli se baahar kachare ke nistaaran kii kya haalat he
 Not only this, garbage is being thrown and burnt at various places in Kanpur
 jalane ke baad dekhne main kachra kam lagata he magar iskaa dhuaan hawa ko kharaab kar detaa he
 The role of corporation personnel is also being talked about in setting fire
 nigam ke karmchaariyon ne baat nahin kii
 Kanpur's air quality index had become quite dangerous
 gandagi ke ambara ko dekhakar lag rahaa he ki kanpur kii sansthaaon kii ichhashakti samaapt ho gai he
 According to Amar Ujala's report, 51 people died of dengue in Kanpur
 buudhvaar ko 8 logon kii maut ho gai
 Beds are filled in government hospitals in Kanpur
 aas paas ke ilaakon se bhi log aa rahe hai
 Our colleague also messaged the Chief Medical Officer of Kanpur but there was no response to the data
 amar ujaalaa main siemo ashok shukla kaa bayaan chapa he ki ham privet pathology waalon kii dengue kii report ko nahin maanate hai
 Only one person died of dengue in Kanpur
 lekin ashok shukla kaa hi bayaan chapa he ki kanpur main dengue ke marizon kii sankhya 1200 se adhik ho chuki he
 Unless the problem of waste in cities like Kanpur and Rudrapur will be ignored, the causes of pollution will not be seen there, what will happen if only Delhi is done
 pradooshan kii nazar se bharat ko dekhie, nyaaypalika kii nazar se bharat ko dekhie aapaki yojanaayen badal jaaengi
 Neither can flee from Delhi nor can Kanpur flee to Delhi
 aspataalon kaa bijness acha chal rahaa hoga
 The air quality index in Delhi remained poor even after light rain
 jab tak baari barish nahin hogi, dilli waalon ko raahat nahin milegi
 The wind trend is also not helping Delhi
 aisa lagata he ki hawa dilli se kahin chali jaae
 But if the polluted air is fatal for the people of Delhi, it is also for the people of Kanpur and Sonipat
 supreme court ke aadesh ke baad 300 jagahon par jaanch ho rahi he
 Look at this report so that you can question in Patna Kanpur and Bhatinda that pollution is spreading in them too, similar to Delhi but no one is coming and nothing is happening
 dilli gajiabad border par ek aisa ilaaka he jahaan ghani aabaadi ke bich ye factriyaan chalati hai
 These factories operating among the population cause massive pollution at night
 dilli main in factriyon ko band karana isliye bhi mushkil he kyonki factriyon ko sil karne kaa adhikaar jila prashasan ke paas, license dekhne kaa kaam emsidi ke paas, pradooshan check karne kaa adhikaar dilli pradooshan control cameti ke paas, bijli kaatane kaa kaam bisies or khataron se bhari is karrwai ko bina dilli police ke sahyog se karnaa mumkin nahin he
 Due to the court's order, unity has come in these departments, but it will tell only how many days it will last

 bilaval is aspataal ke navnirmit trama centre ke udghaatan ke liye gaye the, jiskaa naam unki divangat maa or purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 The child's father said that due to VIP protocol given to Bilawal during a visit to the hospital, his child could not get treatment and died
 'pehle main bike se aayaa or phir paidal, lekin mujhe andar nahin aane diya gaya or meri bacchee kii jaan chali gai
 The victim claimed that while bringing the ailing girl, he got stuck in traffic due to VIP movement and then was not allowed to enter the hospital
 tippaniyan Bilawal came to the hospital with Sindh Chief Minister Syed Kayem Ali Shah after which the entry and exit sites of the institute were closed
 ambulinceon ko bhi andar nahin aane diya gaya
 Bilawal later announced on Twitter that he was deeply saddened by the girl's death and ordered an inquiry into the incident

 pehle test match main karaari haar ke baad australia vaapasi ke liye qamar kas chukaa he lekin dakshin africa ke khilaaf shanivaar se yahaan shuru hone vaale duusare test cricket match main barish uski ummiido par pani pher sakati he
 Heavy rain is predicted in Hobart until Monday which will be the third day of the match
 yah australia ke liye acchhee khabar nahin he jo perth main pehle test match main 177 ran kii haar se vaapasi karne ke liye betaab he
 Australia is looking to get into this match with four bowlers
 captain steve smith or unki team pehle match kii galatiyon ke kaaran aalochakon ke nishane par he or ab team prabandhan chayan main kisi tarah kii galati nahin karnaa chahta
 Smith has several options though
 smith ne pushti kii ki paanchaven number par utarane vaale ballebaaj adam voges feet hai vah mansapeshiyon main khinchaav se pareshaan the
 He was also hinted that Australia might come down with six batsmen which could lead to all-rounder Mitchell Marsh and spinner Nathan Lyon sitting out
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘team ko lekar abhi koi faisla nahin hua
 Wait till tomorrow morning
 ham phir se wicket dekhne or mausam kii bhavishyavaanee ke anusaar hi faisla karenge
 The prediction for the next two days is not good and so we will have to wait till the toss
 ’ Smith was asked if he was thinking of landing with four bowlers as the bowlers could get enough rest due to rain, he said, "not sure yet
" yah chayankartaaon par nirbhar karata he or ve kal faisla karenge
 We will have to wait
 kuch bhi sambhav he
 ' david warner ke saath jo burns ke pari kii shuruuaat karne kii sambhaavna he jabaki jo meni ko apana pehla test khilne kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 Tasmania fast bowler Jackson Bird has also been included in the squad
 chayankartaaon ne pehle voges ke cover ke liye calum fagarusan ko team main rakhaa he or yadi australia atirikt ballebaaj ko lekar utarataa he to vah bhi ek vikalp ho sakate hai
 As far as South Africa is concerned, after a long time he will go into a match in which both AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn will not be in his XI
 tippaniyan De Villiers did not come on tour due to injury, while Steyn's shoulder suffered an injury during the first Test and he may have to undergo surgery
 aisi sthiti main unhen chah maheene tak baahar rahanaa padegaa
 Cagiso Rabada played a good role in Perth in Stan's absence and became the 'man of the match'
 sten kii jagah kyle abot le sakate hai
 If Morne Morkel also fits, then he too can be placed in the playing eleven
 yadi paristhitiyaan tej gendbaajon ke anukool rahi to phir dakshin africa bhi chaar tej gendbaajon ke saath utar saktaa he or aise main keshav maharaj ko baahar baithna padegaa
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) This is not good news for Australia, who are desperate to make a comeback with a 177-run defeat in the first Test in Perth
 australia is match main chaar gendbaajon ke saath utarane kii soch rahaa he
 Captain Steve Smith and his team have been under the scanner of critics due to the mistakes of the first match and now the team management does not want to make any mistake in the selection
 smith ke paas haalanki kai vikalp hai

 The BJP claims that it will repeat the 2014 victory this year as well
 par chunavi ankaganit is baat kaa samarthan nahin karata
 If SP-BSP votes are combined in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP will not get more than 37 seats in 2019
 par use bharosa he ki modi kaa karishma duusari sabhi chunautiyon par baari pad rahaa he or party usee jeet kii ore bad rahi he
 The Prime Minister's rallies saw enthusiastic crowds at places like Aligarh
 modi apni chunavi reliyon main jagah or shrotaaon ke hisaab se bhaashan main badlaav karte hai, phir bhi rashtriya suraksha har jagah unka kendriya vishay rahata he
 He has lost no opportunity to play the communal strategic card of the BJP, by discussing the mutual rivalry between the SP and the BSP and the 'special love for Muslims' of the two parties
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ko bharosa he ki unki chunavi ranneeti sahi chal rahi he
 He believes that by contesting the Congress separately (congress in 2014 7
 5 fisadi vot hasil kiye the) sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke vot kaat rahi he
 In 2014, SP got 22
 2 pratishat or basapa ko 19
 6 percent votes were received
 par donon kaa sanyukt vot bhi bhaajapa ke 42
 3 percent (43 of NDA
 3 pratishat vot tha) se kam tha
 Had the Congress also been part of the alliance, the BJP could have been in trouble
 shah ummid kar rahe hai ki satta virdohi lahar or krishi sankat jaise anya muddon ke kaaran bhaajapa ko jitne voton kaa nuksaan hoga, uski bharpai modi kii kendriya yojanaon ke kareeb 3 karod labhaarthiyon se dhanyavad ke rup main mili voton se ho jaaegi
 The Balakot attack will also have an impact as the Pulwama attack was the biggest boil in UP
 maare gaye 40 javaanon main se 12 upi se the
 The staunch nationalism of Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will also attract many people
 bhaajapa kaa kahana he ki upi main uske 2 lakh boothstar ke kaaryakarta hai jo pradesh ke kul 1,63,000 boothon main se 1,48,000 boothon ko cover karte hai
 Their main target will be the beneficiaries of the central schemes of the PM
 12 labhaarthiyon tak pahunchane ke liye ausatan ek kaaryakarta kii tainaati kii gai he
 "our booth workers at the booth level are leaving no stone unturned to reach the beneficiaries in favor of the party," says Shah, who won the party two historic victories in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections
 ''hameshaa kii tarah bhaajapa ke turup ke pattey modi, shah or yogi adityanath hai
 Together, the three will hold about 150 public meetings in the state
 vishesh rup se shahari kshetron main modi kii reliyon main logon kii baari bheed umad rahi he
 The caste equations are still dominated in rural areas, yet the Prime Minister remains a major factor among the rural voters
 rahul gandhi kii paaramparik seat amethi main bhi—jahaan bhaajapa gram sadak yojana jaisi kendriya yojanaon ke saath bahut sakriy rahi he
 Yet the Gandhi family's hold over Amethi seems clear
 haalanki, 20 april ko mainpuri main hui sapa diggaj mulaayam singh yadav or basapa pramukh mayawati kii ek sanyukt raily se bhaajapa chintit he
 Appearing both together in public can throw out the bjp's efforts to tie up at the grassroots level
 bhaajapa ko ummid thi ki sapa-basapa ke kaaryakartaaon main puraani adaavat rahi he, jisase aapas main unke voton kaa paryaapt hastantaran nahin hoga
 It was being speculated that the SP BSP would have trouble transferring votes
 par mainpuri kii sabha or mulaayam kii ore se mayawati kii khub prashansa karnaa, basapa ko kattar dushman samajhane vaale sapa kaaryakartaaon kii katutaa dur kar saktaa he
 Another reason for bjp's worry is the mobilization of Muslim votes in favor of SP-BSP
 bhaajapa musalamaanon ko aakarshith karne tak main naakaam rahi he par party kaa maananaa he ki iskaa asar sirf 20 siton par hi hoga
 Elsewhere, the caste equation that Shah has created with BJP general secretary Sunil Bansal will go in favor of the party
 anusuchit jatiyon main, party zyaadaatar gaiyr-jatvon jaise dhobi, coli or valmiki jati ke ummidavaaron ko utaar rahi he
 The Jatavs are the main supporters of Mayawati 
 adityanath or bansal ke bich puraane matbhed rahe hai
 Sources say that both have buried their differences
 aresas ke bharosemand bansal ne sanghathan ko chunaav abhiyaan main safaltaapurvak utaar diya he
 The BJP believes that it has kept a good hold in the state's electoral battle
 yah jaruri bhi he kyonki dilli ke takchat kaa rasta upi se hokar jaataa he
 Cool *** lok janashakti party ke sabhi 12 vidhayakon ne bihar vidhansabha ke shesh satr ke liye nilambit kiye jane ke virodh main guuruuvaar ko sadan kii sadsyta se istipha de diya

 LJP spokesperson Keshav Singh said all the 12 mlas have submitted their resignations to the party's national president Ram Vilas Paswan and state unit chief Pashupatikumar Paras in protest against the suspension for the rest of the session
 vidhayakon ne buudhvaar shaam party ke vidhayak dal kii baithak main apane istife saunpe or party adhyaksh se nirnay karne kaa anurodh kiya
 The legislators feel that it is meaningless to remain a member of the state assembly after suspending him on Wednesday and humiliating him by the Speaker
 choudhary ne lojpa ke 12 main se 11 vidhayakon ko mangalvaar tathaa buudhvaar ko sadan main unke asanyamit aacharan ke kaaran kal nilambit kar diya tha

 itnaa hi nahin, rafel maamle par supreme court ne rajyasabha saansad sanjay singh kii yachika par sunwaayee karne se inkaar kar diya he
 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said during a hearing on a review petition filed on the Rafael Deal case on Wednesday that AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh has made derogatory remarks against the court in the Rafael case

 The International Cricket Council (ICC), however, rejected bcci's request, saying it had no role in such cases
 tata motors kii ‘herier’ ko ipel kaa adhikarik saajhedaar banane kii ghoshnaa ke liye yojit press conference main choudhary se poocha gaya ki kya us patr main vishesh rup se pakistan kaa naam nahin likhnaa galati thi, to unhone kaha, ‘maine patr nahin likhaa
 The letter was written by BCCI CEO Rahul Johri after consultations with the Committee of Administrators (COA) after 40 CRPF personnel were killed in the Pulwama terror attack
 is hamale kii jimmedaari pakistan se sanchalit aatankwaadi sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne lee thi
 Chaudhary said, "the ICC Chairman (shashank Manohar) had given a statement on this issue and he said that the matter is outside the purview of the ICC
 ’ICC ne thukraai PAK se sambandh khatm karne kii maang, kaha- ye hamaara kaam nahinyah poochne par ki kya bisisiai ne is prastaav ko taiyaar karne main galati kii, unhone kaha, ‘main sabhi atakalon ko viraam lagaana chahta hum ki najariye main koi antar nahin tha
 The BCCI CEO had written communication with the ICC
 is samvaad main do bindu the - pehla bindu suraksha se judaa tha
 In reference to the content of this letter, Chaudhary said that before the World Cup, the main concern of the BCCI is the safety of the players
 choudhary ne kaha, ‘doosraa mudda is suzav se judaa tha ki bharat or isisi ke anya sadasyon ko un tiimon ke saath hissaa nahin lenaa chahie, jo un kshetron se aati hai, jahaan kuch nishchit ghatnaayen hoti hai, lekin patr main kshetra kaa zikr nahin tha
 "he said," The ICC chairman said after discussing it with the ICC Board, the only institution making ICC policy, that it is not within the scope of the ICC to react or decide on it
 ’ choudhary ne kaha ki bisisiai or vishwa doping rodhi agency (wada) ke bich takaraav kaa hal nikaalnaa jaruri he, jisase ki wada isisi ko anupaalan nahin karne vaala ghoshit nahin kare
 He said, 'this is an issue
 vaishvik sanstha (wada) pichley kuch samay se isisi se baat kar rahi he or mudda yah he ki isisi ke sabhi pratispardhi deshon ko rashtriya pareekshan adhikaran se judana hoga
 Chaudhary said, "the only member of the ICC who has opposed it so far is the BCCI and the reason is well known and that is why this issue is urgent
" isisi chairman kaa najariya he ki maamle kii ahmiyat ko dekhte hue vah jald hi bisisiai ke saath baat karenge, jisase ki isisi ko anupaalan nahin karne vaali sanstha nahin ghoshit kiya jaae
 He said that the selectors are working on managing the workload of the main players of the Indian ODI international team in view of the World Cup to be held from May 30 immediately after the IPL
 choudhary ne kaha, ‘is samay vistaar se bataanaa uchit nahin hoga, lekin chayankarta bhi is par kaam kar rahe hai
 "bcci's gritty, not a boycott of PAK in the agenda of the ICC meeting! Chaudhary was asked if the IPL franchises have agreed in principle
" unhone saath hi bataaya ki ipel maichon ke samay ko pehle karne par bhi kaam chal rahaa he
 IPL CEO Hemang Amin said the issue was under consideration
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley saal hamane plaof kaa samay pehle kar shaam 7 baje kar diya tha
 We are still considering whether to do it a little earlier or keep it at 8 pm, as it will also affect the afternoon match
 pichley itane varshon se ham dopaher main 12 se 15 match khel rahe hai or iskaa inkaa par asar padegaa
 'amin said,' Players also have to be taken care of, because if we do the 8 o'clock match first, then the afternoon match time will also have to be changed
 ummid karte hai ki ek hafte ke andar ham samay kii ghoshnaa kar denge

 Indraprastha Ramlila, to be held at Patparganj in the capital Delhi, saw a strange sight on Wednesday, where several corporators were seen on the stage together, playing the role of Ramlila, the Mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation and Leader of Opposition
 manch swatchta or beti bachaao kaa sandesh bhi diya gaya aisa laga maano netaaon ne apni raajnneeti chhod kar ek nai parampara kii shuruyaat kar di he lekin manch se utarate hi kuch ajeeb hua
 The Mayor gave the message of Clean India on the stage, the Leader of the Opposition gave the message of Beti Bachao, when Sita Mata was leaving, then East Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Satya Sharma, who was playing the role of Ramlila from the platform, said that we Cleanliness should be maintained around you

 As soon as the fight came out, everything appeared fine in the Mayor and Leader of the Opposition, but when the reporters started asking questions, they started praising their leaders in front of the camera

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke suresh bhaiyyaji joshi ek baar phir sarkarywah banaae gaye, lekin unke chune jane ke baad yah charchaa joro par he ki sangh kaa ek dhada bhaiyaji joshi ke sarkarywah banane se khush nahin he?is bare main sangh se jude sutara bataate hai ki isse pehle datratreya hosbhole ko sarkarywah banaae jane kii atakalein thim
 There was also news in many news channels and newspapers that Hosbole would become Sarkaryavah
 lekin ant membhaiyyaji joshike naam par muhar lagi
 Now he will be Sarkaryavah for the next three years (2018-2021)
 aapako yaad dilaa den ki sarkarywah chunaav ke pehle bhaiyyaji joshi ne umr kaa hawala dete hue dobaaraa sarkarywah banane kii ichha se inkaar kar diya tha
 In such a situation, the buzz was raised that 63-year-old Hosbole would replace him
 kyonki iske do kaaran maane ja rahe the
 The first is that Hosbole was close to PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, while the second reason is that there are Karnataka elections in coming times and Hosbole, 63, belongs to Karnataka
 aise main hosbhole karnataka main badi bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 There is also an argument of Sangh sources that Prime Minister Modi wanted to strengthen his hold on RSS by making Hosabole as Sarkaryavah
 isse sangh ke ek dhade main yah dharna bhi bani ki hosbhole sarkarywah banate hai to aresas par pradhanmantri modi kaa samarthak tabaka haaavee ho jayega
 This will weaken the Sangh in the guiding role for the BJP
 kaha jaataa he ki sangh ke chunaav main pehali baar lobing dekhne ko mili
 This also angered a section of the Sangh core committee and Bhaiyyaji Joshi was re-elected in place of Hosabole
 kyon hosbhole ko lekar he sangh main bechaini
 
 
 Let us tell you that Dattatreya Hosbolesangh is the first person of the core committee whose public life started with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) even before he became a Sangh pracharak
 ve abivipi main hi aresas kii taraf se do dashak tak sanghathan mahaamantri bhi rahe
 He completely engaged himself in RSS activities
 bijepi main aalaa netaaon tak pahunch rakhane kaa unhen yah phayda mila ki ve sidhe-sidhe sangh kii kor kamity main shaamil ho gaye
 What is Sarkaryavah post
 
 
 sangh main sabase bada pad sarasanghachaalak kaa hota he
 Mohan Bhagwat is still in this position
 aresas ke samvidhan ke anusaar, unhen maardarshak-pathpradarshak kaa darza mila he, isliye ve sangh kii rosemara kii gatividhiyon main sakriy bhoomika nahin nibhaate
 In such a situation, the entire functioning of the Sangh under his guidance is seen by Sarkaryavah and only four co-sarkaryavahs with him
 yadi korporate kii bhashaa main kaha jaae to sarkarywah asal main kisi company ke siio kii tarah bhoomika nibhaate hai
 According to political experts, if Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah had succeeded in bringing Dattatreya Hosabole to the post of Sarkaryavah, the Sangh's interference in ticket and ministerial sharing would have been affected

 Hafiz Saeed is not directly in the electoral fray, but his 250 candidates are dreaming of defeating Islamabad
 bandook or bam ke jariye bharat ko gidad bhabhaki dene vaale hafiz said ke sur main bharat par parmaanu hamale kaa har din raag rahata he
 Kamasutra, a polling agent who has been removed from loc and given to terrorists, has informed that Pakistan's intelligence agency has reduced the terrorists from the launching pad on loc, which was around 600 earlier, as the elections approached
 unki sankhya lagbhag 50 pratishat hokar 270 se 280 ke aasapaas bachi he
 Sources have informed that Hafiz Saeed, with the help of the Pakistan Army and ISI, has called 300 of his terrorists from the launching pad of the loc and given him the job of polling agent in the election
 sutron ke mutabiq sarkari suraksha parahafiz saidako bharosa nahin he, isliye usne lashkar ke trand ladaakon ko apane bete talha or apane damaad kii suraksha main lagaaya he
 Terrorists will become electoral agents of Hafiz's son, not only this, but according to intelligence report, after fear of election disturbances, Hafiz has decided to campaign for terrorists ready to infiltrate Kashmir instead of the party's organization and political activists
 
 lashkar ne philhal waapas bulaae gaye aatankiyon ko chunaav prachaar ke kaam main lagane ke alawa apane sanghathan ke ellection offis kii suraksha main bhi lagaaya he
 That means Lashkar terrorists will become polling agents of Hafiz's son
 khufia sutara ne bataaya ki jab aatank ke aakaa hafiz said kaa vaaris chunaav ladakar netaa bananaa chahta he to ye swaabhaavik he ki lashkar ke aatanki apane aakaa ke nirdesh par chunaav agent banenge
 According to intelligence sources, Hafeez Saeed himself called the new trend militants from his training camp in Muzaffarabad on Sunday and entrusted him with electoral responsibility
 usne bharat ke khilaaf zehar bhi ugala tha, lekin peshawar kii chunavi raily main dhamaake ke baad seemapar se aatankiyon ke ghuspaith ko cover fire dene ke bajaay pakistani sena kii praathamikta ab 25 july ko hone vaale pakistan neshnal assembly ke liye aam chunaav kii suraksha he
 According to the sources, for this, the Pakistan Army has withdrawn about 7000 personnel from the loc and put them on election security duty, while 6000 Rangers and officers of Rangers from the International Border are called back in election duty
 have put
 khufia sutron ke mutabiq pakistan sena ke badale ranneeti kii vazah se seemapar se hone hone vaali firing main achaanak behad kami ai he
 From January 2018 to June 15, there were 1100 minor incidents of ceasefire violations, but in the last 20 days, there has been firing from the border only 10 times
 shantipurna chunaav karaane main pakistan kii sena ne apni takat jhonk di he
 Militant Saeed has withdrawn the army and Rangers battalion from the loc and the international border and put them in election duty, so that the Taliban militants cannot spread violence
 sutron ke mutabiq pakistani sena elosi or antarrashtriya seemaa se suraksha balon ko waapas bulaane kii duusari badi vazah ye he ki bharat ke taraf se javaabi karrwai main pakistan kii sena ko hone vaale bade nuksaan se bachanaa
 Because this can also become an electoral issue, which may have to be raised by the party of Lashkar and Imran Khan, who are contesting elections with the support of the army

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter ayodhya main ram mandir mudde par vinay katiyaar ne bijepi sarkaar kii manshaa par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 BJP leader Vinay Katiyar said that he does not think there will be any way to build a Ram temple before the 2019 elections
 katiyaar ke mutabik sangharsh hi aakhri rasta he
 Katiyar did not say anything about what that struggle would be
 katiyaar ne is maamle main deree ke liye sangh ko bhi katghare main khadaa kiya
 He said that the Sangh too delayed to take initiative in this matter
 sarkaar is maamle ko lekar gambhir nahin dikhi
 Katiyar said, 'it seemed from the beginning that the government was not taking any step on this issue
 'adhyadesh laane ke mudde par vinay katiyaar kaa maananaa he ki iske liye jaruri sankhya bal na to bijepi sarkaar ke paas he or na hi adhyadesh laane se koi rasta nikalegaa, kyonki yah mudda ram mandir banane kaa nahin he balki adaalat main jo maamla lambit he vah jameen ke vivaad kaa he
 Katiyar said that what would be the benefit of bringing an ordinance on it? According to Vinay Katiyar, the government and both have taken a long time in this matter and gradually the matter is getting out of both hands
 vinay katiyaar ne phir se doharaaya ki is maamle main sangharsh hi aakhri rasta he lekin sangharsh kya hoga, iske bare main kuch nahin kaha
 The BJP government is under questions after the Supreme Court extended the hearing till January in the Ram temple case

 On the other hand, Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha can bring a private member bill on it amid the constantly increasing demand for construction of Ram temple
 guuruuvaar ko rakesh sinha ne twit kar kaha ki jo log bijepi or aresas ko ulaahna de rahe hai ki ram mandir kii taarikh bataaen kya vah unke privet bill kaa samarthan karenge
 He wrote that the time has come that milk should be made of milk and water of water

 Rakesh Sinha wrote that if the Leader of the Opposition wants to give him any suggestions on the bill, he can give it

 The Supreme Court on Tuesday established a constitutional principle under which disgruntled parties can seek a stay on the publication of a court hearing from the appropriate court and will be decided on a case by case basis
 court ne haalanki, vichaaradhin adalati maamalon kii reporting ke liye vyapak disha nirdesh tay karne se yah kahkar duuri banaai ki ise ‘samaan rup se sab par lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The bench said that freedom of speech and expression under the constitution is not unlimited and journalists should have knowledge of their 'lakshman Rekha', so that they do not cross the line of contempt
 pradhan nyaayadhish es ech kapadia ke netritv vaali paanch nyaayadhishon kii peeth ne kaha ki vah sanvaidhanik siddhant tay kar rahi he, jiske tahat asunsht paksh uchit adaalat se adalati sunwaayee ke prakaashan par sthagan kii maang kar sakenge
 The bench said that the court concerned will decide on the question of postponement of reporting of court proceedings on a case by case basis
 pradhan nyaayadhish ke netritv main nyaayamurti dike jain, es es nijjar, ranjana prakaash desai or jees shekhar kii sadsyta vaali peeth ne yah bhi kaha, ‘ham disha nirdesh tay nahin kar rahe hai, lekin hamane sanvaidhanik siddhant diya he or hai court or supreme court maamle se maamle ke aadhaar par yah faisla karengi ki sthagan aadesh (reporting par) kab diya jaae
 'the bench said,' Therefore, guidelines on media reporting cannot be applied equally to everyone
 ’ adalati kaarywahi ke prakaashan par sthagan kaa siddhant pratipaadit karte hue peeth ne kaha ki yah ek nivarak kadam he, na ki pratibandhaatmak or dandatmak kadam
 It further stated that a temporary ban on the publication of court proceedings is necessary to balance between the freedom of speech and fair trial for the proper administration of justice
 peeth ne kaha ki adalati kaarywahi ke prakaashan par sthagan kii vahaan jarurat hogi jahaan mukademe or nyaay prashasan ke pratikul rup se prabhavit hone kaa vaastavik jokhim ho
 The Chief Justice, who read the verdict, said that a reasonable restriction on reporting of court proceedings is needed in the interest of society and this principle of adjournment is one of the 'neutrality techniques'

 isse pehle, donon timen pool varg main aapas main bhid chuki thim
 The match was tied 1–1
 us match main afghanistan ne pehla gol kiya tha jabaki bharat ne barabari kii thi

 bihar chunaav main saare dal daanv-pench kii raajnneeti main dilojaan se jute hai
 The more the leaders talk
 vikaas, jangalraj, mandal, kamandal ke jumale aam ho gaye hai
 There is talk of development in every rally, but the target is only on caste
 chunavi bisaat par sabaki goti laal ho is aas main sabane jati ke hisaab se apane mohare sajaae hai
 The situation has become such that now every leader of the party is standing in the crowd and is trying to spread his bag in front of the voters by telling himself to be a descendant of Emperor Ashoka, sometimes Ram or Krishna
 vikaas kii baat karne vaali bijepi ne chaatro ko laptop, medhaavi chaatraon ko skuti, dalit-mahadalit ke gharon main rangeen tivi, garibon ko sari-dhoti dene ke vaade kiye hai
 The thing to note among all this is that it has been thought of keeping the caste ahead
 bihar main shiksha ke naam par chaahe charvaaha vidhyalay, mid-de mil, cycle, skuti yaa laptop kii baat ho iske dam par shiksha ke str ko katai nahin sudhara ja saktaa
 In order to improve the standard of education in Bihar, firstly, it is necessary to have transparent arrangement of qualified teachers with better arrangements in government schools
 kul milakar ye kaha ja saktaa he ki jatvaad ko hathiyaar banaakar bihar kii janata ko asli muddon se bhatkaana in tamaam dalon ko bakhubi aa gaya he
 One problem of Bihar is that the intellectual population here is sitting silently on these issues
 aamtaur par yahaan kii buddhijivi aabaadi yaa to baahar rahati he yaa phir mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti se dur
 In such a situation, the messages of a handful of politicians or the leaders of minorities are reaching among the public
 agar sant samaaj, swayamsevi sansthaaen or tamaam padhe-likhe log ekajute hokar jatvaad ke khilaaf jaagarukta failaaen to bihar kii tasviir bahut had tak nikhar sakati he
 It is not easy to snatch the political leadership from the backward
 baat agar lalu yadav kii karen to bijepi ne unhen nitish kii madad se 10 saal bihar kii satta se dur rakhaa
 In the mirror of reality, Nitish was never an opponent of Lalu but was his complement in the historical process
 bihar main agar lalu yadav nahin aate to nitish kirajnneeti kaa raastanhin banataa
 If Nitish was not there, Mahadalit like Jitan Ram Manjhi would not have mattered
 nitish-lalu nahin hote to bijepi kii raajnneeti main paswan, kushvaha or maanjhi kii maujuuda haisiyat nahin hoti
 What we are calling caste politics today is not
 aise main loktantr bas kuch logon ke haath kaa khilonaa hota
 The forward would have dominated the country
 alabatta is raajnneeti ke kuch pahalu masalan bhrashtachar, apradheekaran maayoos karanevaale hai jo is prakriya ke khilaaf jate hai
 On the other hand, those who spout on this game of casteism, criminalization and money are often seen doing more dangerous communal politics for their electoral gains
 yuva votaron par najar nahin bihar main jati kii raajnneeti main uljhe dalon kii najar se yuva peedi nadaarad he
 The younger generation, who have stepped up from today's technology, have hoisted their glory everywhere
 voyuva pirijise achche-bure kii pahchaan he
 The younger generation who are now reading the World Bank report
 aaj ye yuva peedi is baat ke liye dukhi he ki sunahare ateet vaala unka bihar vikaas kii raftaar main 21wein paaydaan par baithkar apni kismat par aansu baha rahaa he
 At the same time, investors in Jharkhand are so tempted that they are standing tall at number three in the pace of development
 bihar kaa yuva voter ab jati ko nakaarkar roji-roti kaa sawaal uthaa rahaa he
 The youth of Bihar is eager to get out of the misery of the state
 saaf he ki is varg kaa janadesh jati nahin kaam par hoga
 In such a situation, it can explain which side of the younger generation of Bihar is going to sit
 kehane kii zarurat nahin ki bihar main har siyaasi uthal-puthal kii apni ahmiyat he
 Casteism is a harsh truth in every election here, it cannot be easily eliminated
 ummid kii jaani chahie ki is chunaav main naa to rajput, bhoomihaar, yadav hoga or naa hi pichhadaa or dalit
 It should also be expected that in this election, the Bihari society will react in its own way to the big issue, which will not be based on caste at all
 to dekhnaa yah he ki kai vajahon se behad ahm ho gaya bihar vidhansabha kaa is baar kaa chunaav apane aakhri nattejey main kya tasviir pesh karata he? Bollywood actress Huma Qureshi organized a special party at her house on Friday

 a copy of the YSMS message has been found by intelligence sources

 is saal farvari main kendriya khufia agency intelligence beuro ne grih mantralay ko ek note bheja
 It claimed that Bangladeshi militant factions of their own country were being sheltered in West Bengal and many Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders are helping them hide here
 ye loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle ke din the, lihaaja is note par zyada dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 In such a situation, Gautam Deb, a member of the Central Committee of CPM and former West Bengal Minister, launched a scathing attack through the media
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki tiemasi ke rajyasabha sadsy ahamed hasan imran dabe-chhipe dhang se jamaat-ul-mujahidin bangladesh (jeembi) ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 Earlier in 2012, a state intelligence report had said that Imran had been involved in incidents of communal violence
 iske baavjood mukhyamantri mamata banerjee unhen rajyasabha ke liye manonith karne se hichkichai nahin
 This is the reason why Trinamool's alleged relations with terrorists were once again revealed, so no one was surprised at this
 trinmul ke ye rishte 2 aktubar ko us vakt charchaa main aae jab bardwan jile ke khagaragarh man uske netaa nurul hasan chedhri ke nivas par ek bam visphot main do sandigdh jeembi aatanki maare gaye
 But this time the difference is that the BJP is in power at the Center and after the great success in the Lok Sabha elections its state unit is filled with tremendous enthusiasm
 yahi vajah he ki mamata banerjee or unki party ke liye in aaropon kaa jawaab de paanaa ab mushkil ho rahaa he
 Especially when Banerjee has already been accused of leaving no stone unturned to appease Muslims through several welfare programs
 paryvekshak maanate hai ki yah sab pashchim bengal main dharmik aadhaar par rajnatik dhruvikaran karne ke makasad se kiya ja rahaa he
 Banerjee tasted the first taste of this polarization in September when Shamik Bhattacharya won the Basirhat by-election and became the first BJP leader to enter the state assembly in 15 years
 rajya ke doordaraj ke ilaakon main bijepi ke vikalp ke taur par ubharne kii teen vajahen bataai ja rahi hai—musalamaanon ke kalyankari upayon par banerjee kaa khaasaa jor, trinmul kaaryakartaaon kii kathith “dabangai or bhrashtachar,” tathaa dilli main bijepi kaa sarkaar bananaa
 Muslims constitute around 30% of the state's population
 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaav main trinmul kii baari jeet kaa shrey musalmaan voton ke badi taadaad main unke paksh main lamaband hone ko diya jaataa he

 Shamik Bhattacharya says, "the people of West Bengal never voted on religious grounds
 mamata banerjee ne hi musalamaanon ko rijhaane ke apane aakraamak taur-tareekon se logon ko baantne kii raajnneeti shuru kii
 But now Mamata's intentions are being understood by people, even now Muslims are abandoning her
 ” rajya bijepi adhyaksh rahul sinha daawa karte hai ki bengal ke gaanvon main dheron musalmaan bijepi se jud rahe hai kyonki unhen samaj main aa gaya he ki banerjee mahaj voton kii khatir unhen khayraat baant rahi hai

 Sultana says that she pulled out with Banerjee's support because "she makes a lot of promises but has not fulfilled any of them
" musalmaan to unke liye mahaj vot bank the
 Sultana, who also studies law with literature, asks, "what does it mean to give money to the Imams?" Mamta believes that the Imam will get the votes of Muslims
 thode se rupye-paise kii khayraat, vah bhi sirf kaagajon par baantne ke alaava unhone hamaare liye kiya hi kya he?”sultanaa ne 2011 main trinmul ko vot diya tha, lekin chah maheene pehle ve bijepi main shaamil ho gayi
 She is now the general secretary of the party's minority wing
 unhen ummid he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi bangladesh se hone vaali ghuspaith ko rokane ke liye kade kadam uthaaenge
 However, Udayan Bandyopadhyay, a professor of political science at Bangabasi College in Kolkata, does not believe that there has been a sudden surge in Muslim support for the BJP
 ve kehete hai, “yah kahana sahi nahin hoga ki alpsankhyak vot trinmul se dur ja rahe hai
 It has also happened that Muslims went to the bjp's court to raise political resistance against the ruling mob
 aakhirkaar yah unke liye khud ke bachaav kaa sawaal he
 “even then, the increasing polarization among political parties is taking violent forms
 27 aktubar ko hue bardwan dhamaake ke teen saptaah baad birbhum jile ke maakhara gaanv main trinmul or bijepi samarthakon ke bich jhadpon main teen log maare gaye
 a domestic bomb was hurled at a police officer, in which he was injured
 ek praathmik swasthya centre se bam banane ke saamaan se bhari 16 baltiyaan baraamad huin
 The villagers and the police, however, are saying that these bombs have nothing to do with Burdwan incident; These bombs are only a part of the violent political culture of West Bengal
 (kolkata main iftaar main shaamil mukhyamantri mamata banerjee)bijepi bangladesh se hone vaali ghuspaith ko bada chunavi mudda banane kii yojana bana rahi he
 At the same time, Banerjee deliberately kept silence in this matter
 virdohi kehete hai ki yah unki or zyada muslim vot hathiyaane kii ranneeti he
 In this way, Banerjee has completely reversed her stance: In 2005 she protested by throwing paper on the speaker's chair when she was prevented from raising the subject of "illegal Bangladeshi infiltrators" in the Lok Sabha
 mamata banerjee ne 3 november ko apane party kaaryakartaaon ko trinmul ke khilaaf “durbhaavnapurna prachaar abhiyaanya kaa muqabla karne ke liye ghar-ghar jane kii naseehat di thi
 He has also ordered a booklet to explain the party's stance on the Saradha chit fund scam as well as its alleged links with terrorist groups
 shanti niketan sthit vishwabharati uniwarsity ke chaatr rahul banerjee kehete hai, “mamata ne hamen noummid kiya he
 Due to the continuous infiltration, the population of West Bengal is changing secretly
 lekin hamaari mukhyamantri us vot bank ko khush karne main lagi hai jise videshiyon ne banaaya tha
 However, i hope that Prime Minister Modi will fulfill his promise to drive out the intruders
 ”chaaron taraf se ghir chuki banerjee kaa sara dhyaan ab apni party ko ekajute karne par he

 in donon diggaj netaaon ke naam sharada chitfund ghotaale kii jaanch main saamne aae the or isliye mamata banerjee ne unhen kinare kar diya tha
 But observers say one of the reasons for sidelining her was the increasing influence of Mamta's nephew Abhishek Banerjee in the party
 tiemasi supremeo ke aalochak kehete hai ki unhone vam morche ke khilaaf lambii ladaai ladi thi or rajya main parivartan laane kaa vaada kiya tha
 But after he came to power, the only change has been seen in color - from red to green now
 bandyopadhyaay kehete hai, “trinmul sarkaar na to vikaas kaa nakshaa taiyaar kar saki or na hi vah shiksha main sudhaar, thos audyogic niti or krishi kshetra par dhyaan de saki he
 The government should now insist on big things by overcoming minor disputes

 Ridiculous, but it was seen the bitter truth that after the grenade attack, the policemen ran behind and were looking for cover to protect themselves
 yah bhi dekha gaya ki ek baari pulisavaale ne maukey se bhaagane kii koshish kii or uski rifl peeche latak rahi thi
 The condition of the safety of the people can be gauged from the fact that the spectacle had reached very close to the scene and it felt as if some were watching the spectacle

 As soon as the operation was completed, a few things related to the case appeared to be noticeable
 jaise ki hamalavar aatankiyon ke haath main jahaan eke 47 riflein thi vahiin punjab police ke javaanon ke haath main puraani ho chukin esaelaar rifles
 On the other hand it was also seen that the policemen did not have any bulletproof vest
 yah police force punjab police kii swat team thi
 The surprising thing was that they had knee pads but no helmets
 hamale ke footage dekhne se yah bhi abhas hua ki police waalon ke paas is prakaar ke hamale ke dauraan 'kaise nipta jaae', isaki uchit training nahin thi
 The policemen were not aware of how the grenade was to be thrown
 haasyaaspad he, magar yah ek kadavi sachai dekhi gai ki grenade hamale ke baad police vaale peeche bhaage or apane ko bachaane ke liye cover dhund rahe the
 It was also observed that a heavy cop tried to flee the spot and his rifle was hanging behind
 logon kii suraksha kaa kya haal rahaa iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki tamashbin ghatnasthal ke kaaphi kareeb pahunch gaye the or aisa laga jaise koi tamaasha dekh rahe hon
 The comments subah yah dekha gaya ki bhartiya sena ke special forces ke jawan, jo kaaphi trend the, behatar hathiyaaron se las the, maukey par pahunch gaye the, lekin kaha ja rahaa he ki punjab police ne saaf kar diya tha ki vah is karrwai kii aguwai karegi
 Surprisingly, the Special Forces personnel were engaged in cordoning the area and the police continued in action
 aamtaur par hota yah he ki sena aisi karrwai ko anjaam detii he or police ke jawan ilaake kii gheraabandi karte hai
 It is a fact that all the terrorists were killed and the operation was successful, but once again it was in front of the level of training of our police force and how modern their weapons are

 to kya ham paroksh younachaar kii prachurtaa ke ek nae rog se fusfusaahat bhar kii duuri par hai?kya paroksh younachaar kaa anand uthaa rahe purush yaa mahila ko pataa he ki vah aisa lakhon anya anjaane logon ke saath thik usee samay iskaa saajha kar rahaa he yaa phir ratikreeda ke is paroksh sukh main koi romaanch bachaa he jiske bare main dusron ko bataaya jaae? kya gopneey kaamuk chhaayaon kii duniya ke cellphone, laptop, desktop, tivi or multiplex ke screen par simat aane se paroksh younachaar kii anubhuti kamatar pad gai he yaa phir hamen younachaar ke atirek se bhari duniya main bade ho rahe hamaare bacchon ke liye apane anubhavon ko phir se paribhaashit karnaa hoga?paroksh younachaar se judaa hamaara param sukh, aisa lagata he ki 'vaastavik' or 'kalpanalok' ke vibhinn roopon main maujuud he or yah kii-hole se jhaankne main nahin balki praudyogiki main nihit he or praudyogiki isamen madad bhi kar rahi he
 And possibly this is because technology is able to afford its legitimacy
 'slam valyorism' (masalan, slamdog milinare kii tarj par) or kaam rasik paryatak jaise jumalon kaa ubharna bhi antat us parivartan ko rekhaankit kar rahaa he jisamen kaam rasik ke bare main hamaari samaj badal rahi he
 We used to understand that Kama Rasik means one whose erotic pleasure is hidden in the tilism
 lekin ab paroksh younachaar, aisa lagata he ki anjaani duniya ko dekhne ke sukh kii hadein laangh gaya he isaki sansani iske aavashyak kaamuk tatv ke bajaae yon vikaar main badal gai he
 One might wonder whether this changing idea about erotic disorder, all that moves as it originated from carelessness or whether it is the effect of a rapidly increasing overdose of visual bliss, creates / receives / transmits images Easy access to ones and a pressing desire to make private lives public is spreading in social space as an epidemic of social networking? The questions related to Voyorism / Exhibitionism in the Sex Survey 2009 show our passion for the camera and its keen eye on our sexual fantasies
 vastav main ham apane yug ke valyorism ko forrlt ke kiye 18veen sadi ke samajashastri jarmi bentham ke bandigrih ke us roopatanran se samaj sakate hai jiske baade ke bheetar band, ekaaki kaidiyon ko ham dekh to sakate hai lekin unhen iskaa pataa nahin hota, chautarafa ghire hue lekin puri tarah drishyman, jisamen centre (dekhne vaala) to dekhne kaa adhikaar rakhata he, lekin khud ke dekhe jane kaa nahin
 Such systematic and technical kind of attention can now be said to be enjoyable in the experience of indirect sex
 is khand ke pehle set ke prashnon main ms se judi us avadharana ko samajhane kii koshish kii gai he, yadi hamaare multi media par yakeen karen to, jisane hamaare rashtriya maanas se gopneey tareeke se chipki paroksh younachaar kii pravriti ko ughadkar kar rakh diya he
 It cannot be denied that mobile phones with cameras are responsible for the video recording epidemic
 survey main shaamil 12 fisadi purushon (ludhiana or bangaloru main sarvaadhik) or 4 fisadi mahilaon (mumbai main sarvaadhik) ne mana ki ve apni yon gatividhiyon ko memas ke liye camere main kaid karne ke bare main sochate hai
 The survey is estimated to have emerged as the most provocative form of sexual activity nationwide, with the survey also suggesting that unmarried people rarely imagine MMS sex
 yani yah aam dharna ko chunauti he jiske mutabik ms sex kii avadharana ne yuvaaon ke bich prachand rup se paith jamaa lee he
 Walking camera eyes are capturing the intimate activities of the bedroom of mature marriages for the generations to come, rather than those of teenage boys and girls
 ms sex kii kalpana karne vaali 41 fisadi mahilaayein or aisa kar chuke 44 fisadi purushon ne sweekaar kiya ki unhone apni kalpanaaon ko video screen par saakaar kiya, inamen 56 fisadi purush madhyam varg ke the
 In the 21st century consumerist modernism in which a mobile phone with a camera is probably the most shining symbol and it is making a disguised and far more clever place among the large middle class of India, it is not surprising
 phir yah isse bhi pataa chalata he ki survey main shaamil takreeban sabhi purushon ke paas apana mobile phone tha
 Not surprisingly, more than half of the women and 80 per cent of the men engaged in MMS sex shared the recording with friends and others and then uploaded it to the Internet
 " "anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi vyakti ke antarang rati kshanon ko video main kaid karne kii ichha darasal ang pradarshan karne vaale kii us laalasaa se judi hui he jo chahta he ki in chhaviyon ko us charadivari se baahar le jaaya jaae, jahaan ise kaid kiya gaya tha
 75 percent of the men surveyed have access to the Internet
 bahut thodi-si mahilaon, takreeban aath fisadi or 17 fisadi purushon ne doston or rishtedaaron ke ms dekhne ke daawey kiye
 Women from Mumbai, Delhi, Ludhiana and Ahmedabad were at the forefront and Ludhiana was at the forefront of men
 survey ke is khand main ludhiana ke sabase aage rahane ke peeche shahar kii profile kaa khaas lenaa-dena nahin he
 The tendency of exhibitionism and voirhism is not necessarily in one person simultaneously, it seems that in which one such tendency is there, then it will also have another tendency
 ludhiana ke purushon main yah baat gaur karne laayak haih ms sex kii kalpana karne vaale sarvaadhik purush ludhiana ke the; har paanch main se ek ne daawa kiya ki usne apane doston / rishtedaaron ke ms sex video dekhe lekin inamen se kuch logon ne hi apane khud ke ms taiyaar kiye; jinhone aisa kiya unamem se adhikansh (80 fisadi) ne dusron ke saath apane video kaa saajha kiya or ise internet par bhi daal diya
 Ludhiana was also at the forefront of the scrutinizers, with 90 per cent imagining indirect sexual acts and stimulation from organ exposure
 hamen yaad rakhana chahie ki ludhiana ke aise aankadon kaa saamaanya rup se nikaale jane vaale ausat par mahatvapurn prabhaav hoga
 In different cities, there were considerable differences between women and men about imagining being sexist because of being secretly seen by others or aware of themselves
 rati krida ke samay mahilaon dwaara unhen dekhe jane par badi sankhya main purushon (70 fisadi) ne uttejnaa mahasoos kii
 The South is ahead in this matter: Almost all male and female audiences in Bangalore are excited by the prospect of playing a rati for the female audience
 survey main shaamil 30 fisadi mahilaayein kaam rasikon se uttejit hoti hai, phir vah purush ho yaa mahila isse fark nahin padataa
 The survey revealed that men are more likely to engage in sexual acts or / and organ exposure than women
 lekin survey main shaamil mahilaon-purushon kii yon praathamiktaayen dekhakar kisi ko bhi hairat ho sakati he
 From these figures, can anyone conclude that in 2009, voirhism and / or exhibitionism in the form of sexual behavior has been rampant in metros and small towns across India? It does not seem so
 vastav main jo gaur karne vaali baat he vah yah ki bharat-bade-chote har tarah ke shahar- paaramparik rup se asamaanya maane jane vaale yon vyavhaar ke bare main gambhirtha se sochane laga he or yahaan tak ki aisi kalpanaaon ko saakaar bhi kar rahaa he
 And consumerist global modernism is also set to fly the imagination of the future with little video recording equipment
