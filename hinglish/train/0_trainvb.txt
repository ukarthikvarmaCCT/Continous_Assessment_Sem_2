 But, on Thursday, the Congress office was such that we were running towards the other room of this headquarters to take a response to the statement made in the press briefing hall of the headquarters of All India Congress Committee

 ve indira gandhi se lekar jawahar laal nehru tak, tagore se lekar or nanak-kabir tak sabko uddhrut karte hue bhartiyata kaa matlab samajha chuke the
 Therefore, many journalists were now interested to know the reaction of Janardan Dwivedi after this PC

 Arrived to cover this internal battle of Congress teen darjan se zyaada camaron kaa rukh bhi dvivedi ke kamare kii taraf ho chukaa tha
 Meanwhile, leaving the briefing hall, Maken was sitting in his room informally talking to reporters
 ye sunanaa bhi zaruri hota he ki jaankaree kaa koi aisa dhaagaa na chhot jaae jisase khabar kii hamaari maala goonthne main kami rah jaae
 Listen to what to do here or stay outside Dwivedi's room

 The third way was to keep listening here and in the middle of Dwivedi's room i should also go round

 Maken refused to speak directly to Maken's statement from the briefing hall
 lekin bhartiyata kya he iskaa gyaan kisi se bhi lene se manaa kar diya
 Questioning the understanding and intention of the media, he also questioned the understanding and intention of the Congress leaders who printed on the website

 This figure is also shocking because the Delhi government has been busy with the same plan for the last one week
 is dauraan ye baat lagaataar sarkari sutron kii taraf se aati rahi ki agar od ivan lagu nahin hua, to dilli ke khatre ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 What has been revealed in Terry's research is not surprising but it is startling why the government is not ready to pay attention to the reasons which are directly contributing to the pollution
 sumit sharma bataate hai ki ye baat sirf terry hi nahin balki duusari tamaam research main saaf ho chuki he ki dilli main jo pradooshan hota he, usamen kai fector kaam karte hai
 For example, Delhi itself contributes forty per cent of Delhi's pollution, in addition to 20 per cent of pollution is from the nearby NCR cities like Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Bahadurgarh, from where industrial gases are released
 dilli main kareeb chalis fisadi pradooshan dur daraaj ke rajyon se khaskar uttar kii taraf sthit rajyon se aata he, jahaan bade paimaane par paraali jalaai jaati he
 Now do a post-mortem of Delhi which has forty-four percent of its pollution, then vehicles in Delhi are responsible for one-fourth of this pollution
 isamen puraane vaahan bhi shaamil hai, is ek chauthai pradooshan main ek gada hissaa do pahiyaa vaahanon se bhi aata he
 Obviously there was a lot of politics on pollution, but there are some issues which are going to give a boost to the politics of political parties

 But before you get entangled, listen to the new story of Aarti
 meerut kaa nitish or uttarakhand ke rudrapur kii aarti, rishton ke ajeebogareeb door main uljhi he in donon kii zindagi
 On 16 June, with the aarti with which Rathi was tied in his wrist, he took Agni as a witness on 6 May and made seven rounds
 jo aarti apane maayke se meerut bahu banakar ai thi, wo 40 din main apane pati kii bahan or saas-sasur kii beti kyon bani
 
 ? pati-patni ke bhai-bahan ban jane kaa ye faisla ekatarfa nahin he
 For Aarti too, Nitish is just her brother
 or, nitish ke mata-pita bhi jis aarti ko bade armaan se bahu banaakar ghar laae the, wo bhi ab use beti maan chuke hai or ab aarti ko uski pasand ke ladke ke saath vidaa karne kii taiyaari main hai
 But this changing relationship changed its course again and on June 29, Aarti was overturned once again
 apane jis pati nitish ko 16 june ko usne raakhi baandhi thi usee bhai ko ab phir wo apana pati bataa rahi he
 Aarti has now come out with a new story
 bakaul aarti 16 june ko pati ko raakhi baandhne kaa sara drama uski marji ke khilaaf hua tha
 The in-laws had pressurized him so he had to do all this
 aarti kaa iljaam he ki uske sasuraal vaale dahej ke liye use tang kar rahe the
 But Aarti could not tell why she would tie rakhi to her wife in the hands of her in-laws husband for getting dowry? On 16 June, Aarti said that she was forced to marry Nitish
 jabaki wo to pehle se shaadishuda thi
 He married a boy named Vineet in the temple
 par ab vahi aarti kah rahi he ki nitish se pehle uski koi shaadi nahin hui thi
 He was forcibly married to Vineet by Nitish's family members
 sawaal phir vahi he
 If the issue is only about dowry, then why would Nitish get his wife's second marriage forcibly? Aarti does not even have an answer
 ab aarti pehle sach kah rahi thi yaa ab
 Just know that
 par jis pati ko usne pehle raakhi baandhi or ab phir pati maan rahi he, usee pati yaa bhai ko ab wo jail kii salaakhon ke peeche dekhnaa chaahati he

 Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) national president Chirag Paswan has termed the latest political developments in Maharashtra as a mockery of democracy
 centre main sattarudh rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ke ghatak lojpa ke netaa chiraag paswan ne kaha ki maharashtra main loktantr kaa majaak udaaya ja rahaa he
 He said, 'there cannot be a joke of democracy more than the circumstances that have arisen today
 agar mere haath main hota to main eemaandaaree se pun: janadesh kii maang karata, pun: janata ke bich main jaataa taaki janata ko bhi pataa chale ki aapane kiske saath rahakar janadesh maanga tha
 He said that whatever circumstances have arisen in Maharashtra, it is wrong
 chiraag ne kaha, 'maharashtra main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or shivasena ko sarkaar banane ke liye spasht janadesh mila tha, lekin donon raajnneetik dalon ne apni-apni mahatvakanksha ke chalate sarkaar nahin banaai or vaikalpik gathbandhan banane kii talash shuru hui
 Chief of Shiv Sena (east) Bala Saheb Thackeray has been consistently anti-congress throughout his life
 congress kii nitiyon kaa vah nirantar virodh karte rahe, lekin aaj yah (shivasena) congress se samarthan lene ko taiyaar he
 Similarly, the way Congress used to accuse BJP and Shiv Sena of communalism is ready to compromise its ideology today, it is the irony of democracy
 'siddhanton kii raajnneeti par unhone kaha, 'lok janashakti party par aksar avasarwaad kaa aarope lagata he, lekin ham logon ne kabhi siddhanton ko lekar koi samjhauta nahin kiya
 We are proud that LJP did not have any synergy to form anyone's government
 party kaa gathan 2000 main hua, tab se hamane chunaav se purv gathbandhan kiya or chunaav parinaam aane ke baad ham logon ne kabhi kisi (gathbandhan se itar) kii sarkaar banane ke liye uskaa samarthan nahin kiya
 On the manner in which the BJP formed the government in Maharashtra, he said, 'I consider it wrong, but if any coalition has a mandate (majority), it should prove it
 jis tareeke se bhaajapa ne sarkaar banaai or (devendra) fadanvis ne shapath lee or ajit pavaar unke saath hai, vah apane aapako vidhayak dal kaa netaa kehete hai
 i assume that they will have the support of all the mlas
 'rajg se ghatak dalon ke alag hone par chiraag ne kaha ki ghatak dalon kaa alag hona chintaa kaa vishay he or gathbandhan kii majbootee ke liye samanvay samiti kii aavashyaktaa he
 Let me tell you, LJP is contesting the assembly elections in Jharkhand separately from the NDA and the party has announced to field candidates for 50 seats
 algepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki vah sansad ke chaalu satr main nyaayik seva ayog or rashtriya yuva ayog kaa gathan karne kii maang karenge
 The BJP won the three municipal corporations in the Delhi Municipal Corporation (MCD) elections held last month
 bijepi ne 10 saal kii sattavirohi lahar ko dhata bataate hue bhi jeet hasil kii thi
 This was said to be the effect of PM Modi's intact magic
 vahiin ise rashtriya rajdhani se aam aadmi party kaa utarataa bukhaar bhi kaha gaya
 However, by-elections were held in two wards of the capital, Maujpur and Sarai Peepal Thala
 in vaardon main kramash: aam aadmi party or congress ne jeet hasil kii he
 The votes were cast on both these wards on 14 and 21 May
 aaj voton kii ginati sampann hui
 AAP wins Maujpur seat: The ruling Aam Aadmi Party has won the Maujpur seat in Delhi
 AAP pratyaashee reshma ne yahaan jeet hasil kii he
 He has got a total of 9374 votes
 vah apane nikatatam pratyaashee (congress) se 699 vot aage rahi hai
 Rekha Sharma of Congress got 8374 votes here
 bijepi yahaan tisare number par rahi he
 This is seen as a declining graph of the BJP
 yahambijapi pratyaasheeki jamaanat tak jabt ho gai he
 Earlier this seat was in bjp's account
 congress ne jiti sarai pipal thala sitdesh or pradesh kii satta se dur congress ke liye bhi ye upachunaav raahat kii khabar laae hai
 Apart from this, this is also good news for Congress state president Ajay Maken
 congress ne bijepi ke pratyaashee ko buree tarah haraaya he
 Mukesh Goyal of Congress got 10946 votes here
 bijepi ko yahaan 8203 vot mili hai
 At the same time, AAP candidates got only 2903 votes here
 AAP pratyaashee kii yahaan jamaanat jabt ho gai he
 It shows one thing that the Congress is still relatively popular in the slums

 However, if India won, there were five reasons behind it, which changed the whole story of the series

 Our relationship was just this far
 yah kahkar wo hameshaa ke liye aapako chhod kar chali jaati he
 You are left alone and some memories of him

 When you and he used to laugh with each other
 jab aap or wo ek-duusare ko mahasoos karte the
 The breakup situation after love is very strange but a bitter truth
 kai baar log nashe kaa sahaara lekar gam halkaa karne kii koshish karte hai to kai baar log depressant kii chapet main aa jate hai
 Says Rachna Kothari, a Mumbai-based relationship expert, it has been seen that the breakup does not matter as much as the dropout
 brallep karne vaale ke paas raste hote hai lekin duusare partner ke paas twarit raste nahin hote
 The abandoned person often wants the conditions to be the same and that he or she can find their partner again
 khaali vakt main vah vyakti un lamhon kii yaadon ko sanjone main bitaa detaa he jo ab begaane ho chuke hai
 If you are also going through a similar situation, then you need to consider the following points
 aatmvishleshan karen ki aap kya chaahate hambreyop se guzar rahaa vyakti zyada bhaavnaatmak hota he or practical nazariye se soch paanaa uske liye mushkil hota he
 It is very important to think patiently in such situations
 aapke liye yah jaananaa behad zaruri he ki aap kya chaahate hai
 You want them or miss your close friends with them or you do not care if they do not belong as long as they do not get into another relationship
 lav main mor, needing main les ke lekhak judhit sills kehete hai, aapako yah jaanane kii zarurat he ki kahin yah aapke andar purushatv kii bhaavana to nahin jo aapmen thwesh kaa kaaran bani hui he
 You can find your partner again from the truth inside you
 gaharaai se sochie ki aap unhen kis str par miss karte hai, shaareerik yaa maansik
 If you miss your x at mental level then you can try to regain them
 brallep ke kaarnon kaa vishleshan karankya aapke rishte main samay ke saath duuri badhati chali gai yaa kisi ek haadase kii maar main aapkaa rishta bikhar gaya
 Analyze the reasons for your breakup
 yadi aapkaa rishta samay ke saath kamazor hua to usamen sudhaar kii gunjaaish utani nahin rahati
 If your relationship is broken for a specific reason, then you may have a lot of love possibilities and you can stay positive and move towards the re-start of your relationship
 messej yaa phone kol se sampark na banaaembraop ke baad aap phone kol yaa messej ke jariye usase sampark banane kii koshish naa karen
 It can scare him
 jab aap ek-duusare se alag hote hai to aap ko yah acchhee tarah se samaj main aa saktaa he ki aakhir aap kya chaahate hai
 You should know that there is some positive aspect to the worst of times
 jab aapke saath sab kuch vipareet hota he to bahut hi niraashaa hoti he
 But, eventually it improves your heart condition
 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle block, nagar adhyaksh padon ke liye sahi ummidavaar ko chunane ke makasad se congress netaa rahul gandhi or unki bahan priyanka ne chune hue kaaryakartaaon kaa intervyuu liya
 During the interview, many candidates were seen looking at their armpits
 congress sutron ne bataaya ki rahul or priyanka ne apane daure ke pehle din munshiganj guest house main congress ke 17 block adhyakshon tathaa paanch nagar adhyakshon ke chunaav ke liye jari prakriya ke tahat 10 vikaas khandon ke adhyaksh pad ke kul 40 ummidavaaron kaa intervyuu liya
 Some activists who faced the interview said that Rahul and Priyanka asked them many questions about the history of Congress, Panchayati Raj, upa's major plans, benefits of MNREGA, ways to expand the organization
 salon se block adhyaksh pad ke ummidavaar jitendra singh ne bataaya ki yah saakshaatkaar kisi naukari ke vaaste liye jane vaale intervyuu se kahin zyada kathin tha
 Sangrampur Block Presidential candidate Sabhajit Shukla said that during the interview, Rahul was asking less, rather Priyanka more questions
 sawaalon kii shuruyaat is sawaal se hui ki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main amethi main congress kyon haari or congress kyon kamjor hui? congress sutron ke mutabik, rahul or priyanka ke nirdesh par block tathaa nagar adhyaksh padon ke chunaav ke liye gat 12 july ko prakriya shuru kii gai thi
 He said that the merit list was prepared for the 'interview' of the candidates
 iske liye vidhansabha ke anusaar, maujuuda va purv congress vidhayak, pradesh congress tathaa congress ke sadasyon kii ek samiti banaai gai thi, jisane seniority ke aadhaar par ummidavaaron kii list taiyaar karke rahul ko saunpi thi
 Sources said for the first time such a process has been adopted in the party for the selection of block and city presidents
 khaas baat yah he ki shashikala or panniraselvam donon hi thevar (obisi) samudaay se taalluk rakhte hai or jatigat samikarnon ke lihaaj se ye unki ekajutata kaa kaaran bhi he or satta sangharsh kii sthiti main is votbank ke philhal panniraselvam kaa saath dene kii hi sambhaavna he
 Due to this, Sasikala is likely to suffer a political loss
 lekin yadi shashikala khud ko jayalalita ke raajnneetik vaaris ke rup main pesh karti hai to party ke ek dhade main asantosh kii sthiti main vibhaajan hone kii bhi sambhaavna he
 But legally, a group of more than 90 of the party's current 135 mlas will be needed for a split in the party, which is not possible in the current era
 duusari baat yah he ki us suuratehaal main vipakshi dramuk kii bhoomika mahatvapurn ho jaaegi
 Without his support, it would not be possible for a divided camp to reach power
 yah kayaas isliye lagaae ja rahe hai kyonki shashikala ke karunanidhi parivaar se achche sambandh hai
 The comments duusari baat yah he ki annadramuk ke vidhayak philhal kisi bhi surat main chunaav nahin chahenge kyonki jayalalita ke baad party ke paas philhal koi aisa kaddavar netaa nahin he jiske dam par puure rajya se vot hasil kiye ja saken or agle chunaav chaar saal baad hone hai
 Due to all this, the role of the Center has also become important because in the event of any political stance, the role of the Raj Bhavan and the Governor will be important
 aise main annadramuk ko philhal centre kaa saath chahie or centre ko agle saal july main hone ja rahe raashtrapati chunaav ke lihaaj se is party ke vidhayakon ke samarthan kii darkaar se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In such a situation, the Center will not want any change in the arithmetic of the State Assembly at present
 vahiin iske saath hi jayalalita kii anupasthiti main annadramuk ke votbank par ab dravid partiyon ke saath-saath congress or bijepi kii najar bhi hogi
 But if Sasikala presents herself as the political heir of Jayalalithaa, there is also a possibility of a division of the party in a state of dissatisfaction
 lekin kanoonee rup se party main do-faad ke liye party ke maujuuda 135 vidhayakon main se 90 se adhik ke samooh kii darkaar hogi joki maujuuda daur main sambhav nahin dikhataa
 Secondly, the role of the opposition DMK will become important in that sunset
 uske sahyog ke bina vibhajit kheme kaa satta tak pahunchnaa sambhav nahin hoga
 These speculations are being made because Sasikala has a good relationship with the Karunanidhi family
 tippaniyan The second thing is that the AIADMK mlas will not want to contest the election at any time because after Jayalalithaa, the party does not have any strong leader at the moment to get votes from the entire state and the next elections are to be held after four years
 in sabake chalate centre kii bhoomika bhi ab ahm ho gai he kyonki kisi bhi siyaasi rukh kii sthiti main rajbhavan or rajyapal kii bhoomika ahm hogi
 In such a situation, the AIADMK needs the Center at the moment and the Center cannot be denied the support of the mlas of this party for the Presidential elections to be held in July next year
 aise main centre bhi philhal rajya vidhansabha ke ankaganit main koi pherbadal nahin chahega
 At the same time, in the absence of Jayalalithaa, the vote bank of the AIADMK will now have an eye on the Dravidian parties as well as the Congress and the BJP
 duusari baat yah he ki annadramuk ke vidhayak philhal kisi bhi surat main chunaav nahin chahenge kyonki jayalalita ke baad party ke paas philhal koi aisa kaddavar netaa nahin he jiske dam par puure rajya se vot hasil kiye ja saken or agle chunaav chaar saal baad hone hai
 Due to all this, the role of the Center has also become important because in the event of any political stance, the role of the Raj Bhavan and the Governor will be important
 aise main annadramuk ko philhal centre kaa saath chahie or centre ko agle saal july main hone ja rahe raashtrapati chunaav ke lihaaj se is party ke vidhayakon ke samarthan kii darkaar se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In such a situation, the Center will not want any change in the arithmetic of the State Assembly at present
 vahiin iske saath hi jayalalita kii anupasthiti main annadramuk ke votbank par ab dravid partiyon ke saath-saath congress or bijepi kii najar bhi hogi

 Actually, the figure of 50 thousand was claimed by CM only after discussion with CREDAI, but Noida, Greater Noida authorities did not achieve their target after all the effort
 keval yamuna expresve athurity hi apane 7500 flats ke target ko puraa kar pai he
 The 50 thousand Flatska target was visible from the beginning
 kyonki siem ne jaldi main aankade kaa to elaan kar diya, lekin cridai ne jin riyaayaton kii maang is aankade tak pahunchane ke liye kii thi use ansuna kar diya gaya tha
 The result was that the announcement made to pat him in a hurry could not reach the floor
 ajtak ne oktober main hi cridai ke hawaale se khabar dikhaai thi ki aakhir kyon ye 50 hazaar kaa aankada manzil se koson dur najar aata he
 At the meeting of the Group of Ministers on 4 December, the figure had reached only 32 thousand 500
 iske baad suresh khanna kii aguwai vaale mantri samooh ne athurity ke adhikariyon kii jamkar class lee or 11 disambar tak kaise bhi karke is aankade ko 50 hazaar tak pahunchane ke nirdesh die
 Despite promises at the meeting, instructions were given to the police to arrest the developers who gave the flatten
 lekin varisht police adhikshak lav kumaar ne kisi bhi dhara main giraftaar mumkin na hone kii baat kahkar haath khadey kar die the
 Now on December 23, the CM himself has reduced the figure of 50 thousand to 40 thousand
 agar ye aankada hasil ho bhi jaataa he tab bhi noida-greater noida main pajeshan kaa mudda lataka hi rah jayega
 Here, only 70 thousand flats of Amrapali and Jaypee Group have possession
 inke alaava bhi chote-bade kai developers abhi tak flats kaa legal pajeshan dene ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai
 That is, the issue of possession of houses here is not likely to be resolved soon

 piem modi (PM Narendra Modi) ne aaj daawa kiya ki bhartiya chunaavon ke itihaas main kabhi bhi satta ke paksh main aisi lahar nahin dekhi gai jaisi is baar dekhi ja rahi he
 Although the reality of his claim about the current election will come out on May 23, was there really any wave in favor of power in the past? If we look at the Loksabha Elections in the last few Loksabha elections, the statistics prove the point of taking the edge of the ruling party from time to time, contrary to the claim of PM Modi
 pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) ne aaj banaras (varanasi) main kaha ki desh main pehali baar satta ke paksh main lahar chal rahi he
 He claimed that for the first time in the elections held in the country, this is the first time that the country has seen a wave in favor of 'pro-incumbency Wave'
 lekin kya vaaki aisa he? kya desh main isse pehle hue chunaavon main sattarudh dal ke paksh main kabhi lahar nahin chali?hamane puraane chunaavon ke aankadon ko khangalkar dekha

 After this, in the elections held in 1957, the vote of Congress increased to 47
 8% ho gaye or use 371 siten milin, yani is chunaav main sattarudh congress ke vot 2
 Increased by 81% and increased by seven seats
 isi tarah agar ham baad main hue kuch chunaavon ke aankade bhi dekhen to paaenge ki sattarudh dal kii siten bhi badhin or vot pratishat bhi

 8% voton ke saath congress ko 283 siten mili thim or vah satta main thi
 Later the party was divided and for the first time there were mid-term elections

 The second figure is also that the SC-ST mps have fallen more heavily

 We were surprised by the allegations of PK being anti-religion

 He liked it and gave him his visiting card
 baad main donon ne saath kaam karnaa shuru kiya (abhijaat ne chopra kii film kareeb ke samvaad likhe the)
 In December 2004, i went to Vinod to narrate the rough draft of Lage Raho Munnabhai
 abhijaat bhi vahaan tha
 He said that the thinking of the film is close to his heart because it is about Mahatma Gandhi and he grew up in Ahmedabad
 usne poocha ki kya vah bhi is par kaam kar saktaa he? mujhe hairaani hui ki yah kaise mumkin hoga, kyonki us vakt vah america main rah rahaa tha
 Then he sent me a scene
 bura seen tha vah
 The same night he sent another scene, which was amazing

 maine vinod ke saath ek angreji patakatha likhi thi, 64 squayres (jis par abhitabh bachchan or farhaan akhtar kii bhoomika vaali vajeer ban rahi he), jo raju ne pard lee thi
 He liked a character and a phrase 'in my village' (in my village)
 us vaktamujhe pataa nahin tha ki hamaare vichaar is tarah mil jaaenge
 But the idea he told was so brilliant that i got restless working with him
 saath milakar patakathaayen likhane ke liye kin khoobiyon kii jarurat hoti he?hiranisepana ahan ek ore taak par rakh do
 Joshi: i have to do all this
 yakeen jaaniye
 There is no such thing as ego in it
 chaahe jahaan se aae, ve harek vichaar ko sunate hai
 Hirani: In the beginning i used to think that writing is a work done alone
 lekin madh island ke ve 10 din yaad hai, jab hamane saath lekhan kiya tha
 Its middle-class upbringing and college experiences are similar to mine
 joshiuksar lagata he ki hamaare idia ko moorkhtapurna mana ja saktaa he
 But he instilled in me the confidence that no idea is foolish
 betuki baat par ve hans denge yaa use salike se darkinar kar denge
 Hirani: If i did not like anything, it does not try to forcibly embrace her
 pehle main sochaa karata tha ki main thak nahin saktaa lekin yah mujhe thakaa detaa he
 At 4 in the morning it will say, come on, let's try five more minutes
 aapako kab pataa chalata he ki patakatha ab puri tarah se taiyaar he?hiranishap apni patakatha se kabhi khush nahin ho sakate
 Always feel that it could have been improved
 pike or kaam karne kii jarurat kii vajah se itane dinon tak khinchati gai
 Joshi: i started feeling like an interior designer who enters the house and then does not come out
 hiranishpike par kaam karte hue hamen sabase zyada pareshaani hui
 After this experience, we felt that if we do not solve the script within six to eight months, then we should work on something else
 kuch din pehle abhijaat ne mujhe phone karke kaha, “mujhe lagata he yaar hamane gadabad kar di
 We should have done that scene like this
 ” maine isse kaha, “ab ho gaya, abhijaat
 "but it kept speaking for half an hour
 mujhe kahana padaa, “ab ham kuch nahin kar sakate
 "so he asked," Can you do it on DVD? "even during the shooting, you were struggling to improve the scene
 anoushka (sharma) is baat se khaasi prabhavit huin
 Hirani: It was never on the set before because it was teaching in America then
 is dafe pehali baar yah set par or editing ke dauraan saath tha
 At least there was someone who knew the screenplay better than any other person on the set

 His writing and vision were praised at that time, but i think people do not understand the greatness of his direction
 inke paas tricks kaa khajaana he, jinase ye kahani ko bharosemand or kaamyaab bana dete hai
 Arjit, do you want to direct after being on the set of PK? Joshi: People agree to sit in the director's chair because they think they can do it better
 lekin is maamle main meraa to koi chance hi nahin he
 Hirani: i keep saying this
 joshijaaye mujhase kehete hai ki tumhen apana phone tak saath rakhana yaad nahin rahata
 So how can you think that i can direct? Hirani: Many people will be ready to do this work for you
 joshi mujhe yaad he, jab main lage raho munna bhai likhane ke liye aayaa tha, daftar main har koi mujhase milanaa chahta tha kyonki inhone meri itani tarif jo kar rakhi thi
 It was a very fun experience
 zyaadaatar maukon par lekhakon ko itani izzat nahin di jaati
 During this entire decade, i never felt that i had ever been deceived as a writer
 in filmon par mujhe bhi apana utana hi haq mahasoos hone laga he, jitna inhen hota hoga
 Do you follow any fixed rules while writing? Joshi: While writing, we sit next to each other
 aamane-saamne baithne par baatcheet karne kaa dabaav bana rahata he
 We go for a walk, but nobody talks, the mind keeps on moving and suddenly someone flashes an idea, and this is the time when we talk
 pike likhte samay ham subah 6 baje kaala ghoda or getwe of india jaaya karte the
 Hirani: Many people ask me that you took five years to make it, that is, you are taking life cheaply
 lekin aisa nahin he
 For how long i have not taken a single holiday
 keval 3 edinuts ke baad maine kaam se chuttee lee thi
 Do you find any difference in writing with Vinod? Joshi: Vinod has been my mentor
 unke saath meraa sameekaran alag tarah kaa he
 They have their own rules
 vinod ke saath main tahalne nahin jaataa, unke liye keval chaay banaata hum
 Rajkumar now thinks of writing films without aristocracy? Joshi: Yes, of course
 hiranishmain to inkaa aadi ho chukaa hum
 i do not even ask them
 inhen to saath maanakar hi chalata hum
 The directors call me and ask for their number, which i give them happily
 joshithap yah maanakar nahin chal sakate ki ve keval mere saath hi kaam karenge

 kabhi-kabhi mujhe dar lagata he ki shaayad ve mujhase kah na saken ki jis tarah tumne lage raho munna bhai likhi thi, us tarah tum ab nahin likh paa rahe ho
 can it happen
 kisi din hamaari sheliyaan alag-alag ho sakati hai
 Thinking about that day, i go to shiver
 hiranishmain abhijaat ko kah rahaa tha, kabhi-kabhi mujhe tajjub hota he ki jis din ham filmein bananaa band kar denge, hamen sachmuch nahin pataa ki ham ek duusare se aakhir baat kya karenge?agali kis film par kaam kar rahe hai?hiranigaye mujhe chuttee nahin de rahe hai

 a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused Pakistan of waging an indirect war against India, Pakistan today termed Modi's statements as baseless and said that both countries should focus on resolving the issues rather than indulging in allegations and counter-allegations
 
 pakistan ke videsh karyaalay kii pravaktaa tasaneem asalam ne kaha, sarvocch raajnneetik str par bharat kii taraf se aaropon kii press main ai khabaren bahut durbhagyapurna hai or khaastaur par aise samay main jab pakistan kaa netritv bharat ke saath achche padosi ke sambandh sthapit karnaa chahta he
 He said in a statement, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's visit to India in May was done with the same spirit and gave a renewed momentum to the bilateral relationship
 pradhanmantri modi ne mangalvaar ko leh kii apni yatra ke dauraan sena or vaayu sena ke javaanon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha, hamaare padosi kaa ravaiya durbhagyapurna he
 They do not have the strength to fight the war, but they are using indirect war
 is paroksh jang main begunaah log maare ja rahe hai
 Reacting to Modi's speech, Pakistan's Foreign Office called it 'baseless'
 videsh karyaalay ke vaktavy main kaha gaya, pradhanmantri modi dwaara aatankwaad ke silsile main baar-baar pakistan ke khilaaf bebuniyaad bayaan dene se judi khabaron ke sandarbh main pravaktaa ne kaha he ki pakistan ne lagaataar har tarah se aatankwaad kii ninda kii he
 The spokesman pointed out that Pakistan, which had lost 55,000 of its citizens due to terrorism, is the biggest victim of this problem
 pravaktaa ne kaha, hamaare sashastr bal desh kii sarhadon kii hifaazat ke liye or kisi tarah ke hamale ke khatre kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 "it will be in the larger interest of regional peace that instead of accusations, both countries should focus on resolving all issues through dialogue and work together to foster friendly and cooperative relations," he said

 com / k2m0dlkvnp march main chote parde ke kamedi stars- kapil sharma or sunil grover ke bich jo ladaai hui thi, usase da kapil sharma sho kii team do hisson main bant gai thi
 Some actors of the show were shown to be loyal to Kapil Sharma, while some left their show and separated
 kapil sharma kaa saath chhodane waalon main ali asagar bhi the
 Please tell that Ali Kod was seen in the role of Dadi in the Kapil Sharma show and this character was famous not only among the audience but also among the celebrities
 vaise abhi tak ye mana ja rahaa tha ki sunil kaa saath dene ke liye ali ne kapil sharma kaa sho choda tha
 At the same time, it was also said that Ali was having a lot of trouble with the changed attitude of Kapil Sharma
 lekin sach ab saamne aayaa he
 In an interview given to Promptimes of India, Kapil broke Ali said that what he was very angry about in Kapil Sharma's show was his character
 ali kaa kahana he ki kapil sharma ke sho main unhen jo karactor diya gaya tha, usamen koi gaharaai nahin thi or na hi use achche gadha gaya tha
 Ali says that he started feeling that people have become bored after seeing him in the role of grandmother and now they need to do something else
 safal kariyar ke baavjood depressant main kyon hai kapil sharma
 
 
 Ali says that Kapil Sharma claimed the character to be interesting and different, but it did not happen
 sho main nahin mil rahaa tha speciali ne ye aarope bhi lagaaya ki sho ke ant main unako do minute ke liye bulaayaa jaataa tha or ummid kii jaati thi ki vah kuch kamaal kar dikhaaen
 Ali says that he likewise completed a year on the show and had made up his mind to leave it before Sunil Grover's fight with Kapil Sharma
 vaise ye pehla mauka nahin he jab ali ne kapil sharma ke sho par apane kirdaar se naaraazgi jataai ho
 Will the question come with Kapil Sharma again, everyone's mind is that will there ever be a reconciliation between the old cast of Dakpil Sharma? Sunil Grover has already vowed that he will not work with Kapil Sharma again
 vahiin bharti ne bhi kabhi aisa kiya tha lekin ab vah kapil sharma ke sho kaa hissaa hai
 So what is Ali's intention? On this Ali said that he has vowed not to work again with Kapil Sharma
 balki vah us jahaaj se jude the jisaki captaini kapil sharma ke haath main thi
 So should we understand that if Kapil Sharma wants to overcome the drowning TRP, he can give voice to Ali Asghar! bharat sarkaar ke kendriya swasthya mantralay ne faisla kiya he ki padosi desh pakistan se hindustan ke kisi bhi rajya main koi bhi naagarik aata he to use polio drop pilaai jaaegi
 According to the information, there are 7 countries including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, where polio has not ended
 na sirf in deshon se bharat aane vaale balki in deshon kii yatra par jane waalon ko bhi polio kii khuraaq dene kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 In Chhattisgarh also, precautionary measures are being taken on this
 gauratlab he ki pakistan, afghanistan, nigeria, somalia, kenya, syria or ithopia polio se prabhavit deshon main shaamil hai
 Most people come from Pakistan, Nigeria and Kenya in India
 chhattisgarh ke rajya tikaakaran adhikari dow
 Subhash Pandey says that the Center has received guidelines that every citizen coming from seven countries should be given polio medicine which has not been declared a polio-free nation
 chhattisgarh main pakistan se sarvaadhik log aate hai
 He said that information has been given to the Muslim community to give information about all the visiting persons
 samudaay vishesh ke sheersh padaadhikariyon ko soochna de di gai he ki videshi nagarikon, polio prabhavit deshon ke logon kii jaankaree na sirf den, balki unhen jila aspataal main le jaakar polio kii dawa bhi pilwaayen
 This step is being taken because the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared India as a polio-free nation in an event held in New Delhi on 11 February
 ab agar ek bhi nayaa maamla saamne aata he to beete 18 saal kii mehnat, arabon rupee or is kaary main lage logon kii mehnat bekaar chali jaaegi
 The vaccination officer of the state said that polio vaccination has been arranged in all the district hospitals of the state to stop the spread of polio virus
 polio kii dawa sirf paanch saal tak ke videshi bacchon ko hi nahin, balki bharat aane vaale us prayek nagarikon ko pilaai jaaegi, jo polio prabhavit raashtra ke naagarik hai, chaahe vah kisi bhi aayu varg kaa ho
 It is noteworthy that polio drops are being given in Chhattisgarh under the second phase of polio on Sunday

 bahujan samaajawaadee party adhyaksh mayawati ne narendra modi sarkaar par rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke aage ‘dandavat’ hone kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The failure of the central government on every front, Mayawati said, has proved in front of the organization that the non-accountable 'communal and fascist' thinking of the public has proved that the 'remote control' of the central government failed on every front is in the Union headquarters
 sangh ke saamne sir na jhukaae sarkaarmayawati ne dilli main shuukravaar ko hui sangh kii teen din ke ‘samanvay baithak’ or usamen modi sarkaar dwaara apana ‘report card’ pesh kar sangh se kathith taur par nirdesh lene kii tikhi aalochana karte hue kaha ki ek chuni hui sarkaar ko sirf samvidhan, uski maryaada or janabhaavana ke aage sir jhukaana chaiye, na ki sangh jaise ‘dwesh, ghrinaa, sampradayik or fasivadi soch’ rakhane vaale sanghathan ke saamne
 The government has remote control in Nagpur, he said that the BJP had been terming the government run by its predecessor Congress Government Corimot Control, but the latest developments have proved that the Modi government's remote control union headquarters is in Nagpur and its leadership is in the hands of Sangh leaders is

 The Sangh's thinking is cruel and fascist
 Mayawati said that the latest example of how cruel and fascist the BJP and Sangh Sanghi thinking is is the dictatorial decree of the BJP government in Maharashtra
 jisamen usne apane mantriyon, vidhayakon or saansadon ke khilaaf bolne yaa likhane par kathith taur par ‘deshadroh’ kaa mukadmaa chalaane kii dhamkee di he

 The same question in everyone's mind, why did Rajesh Sahni, who is very calm and reconciled, finally committed suicide? These questions are arising in the mind of the people- The biggest question is why did Rajesh Sahni come to his office despite being on leave? What happened to Rajesh Sawhney, who came calmly from home, and finally shot him by asking for a service revolver from his driver? - His people say that he is very well a wanted man

 The front door was closed from the inside, but the back door had a slit outside, which opened easily
 aakhir aisa kyon tha?- rajesh saahani ke goli maarane ko bare me pataa chalate hi aties ke saathi unhen fouran aspataal lekar kyon nahin gaye?- goli lagane ke baad jaanch ke liye privet aspataal se doctor kyon bulaayaa gaya, jabaki lohia aspataal paas main hi he?- rajesh saahani kii deadbody chaar ghante aties ke daftar main hi kyon padi rahi?- jis dryver ne saahani ko revolver laakar di, use aakhir adhikari saamne aane se kyon roak rahe hai?- aakhirkaar itane sulajhe hue vyakti ne khudakushi se pehle koi sucite note kyon nahin choda?

 unhone kaha tha ki ve is saal koi rijolyushan nahin le rahi hai balki sabko shubhakamanaayen dena chahengi
 Rishi Kapoor was very much in discussion with his previous film 'mulk'
 iske alaava ve netflix film raajma chaaval main bhi nazar aae the
 Bollywood actress Aaliya Bhattki is a meat lover Rajbadka Aajbirthde
 gunaah, gumraah, saransh or raji jaisi filmon main kaam kar chukin actress soni razdan ko beti aalia ne khaas andaaj main berthde vish kiya
 Alia shared an old picture of Sony from her Instagram account
 is tasviir main soni kaaphi yang najar aa rahi hai or unke pati mahesh bhatta unke saath khadey hai
 In the caption of the picture, Alia wrote a message filled with emotions
 aalia ne likhaa, "happy berthde meri khubasurat-khubasurat mummy
 Thank you for being an example of projecting the inner beauty outside
 shabdon kii koi seemaa nahin he jo yah bayaan kar sake ki main kitni khushkismat hum aap jaisi maa, dost or diet partner paakar
 Even saying this thing 10 million times a day will not be enough
 lekin main aapse bahut pyaar karti hum maa
 "alia Bhatt and Sony Rajdhan appeared together for the first time in the film Raazi
 soni ne ek intervyuu main aalia ke bare main kaha, "mujhe kaam ko lekar uskaa najariya kaaphi pasand he
 She lives a different life and brings a different quality to her performance and character
 mujhe khushi hoti he ki aaj har koi mujhe aalia kii maa ke taur par jaanata he
 "talking about work front, Alia will soon be seen opposite Ranveer Singh in the film Gully Boy
 iske alaava vah film brahmastra or kalank main bhi ahm kirdaar nibhaati najar aaengi
 She will be seen working with Ranveer Kapoor for the first time in the film Brahmastra

 jis vigyaapan ko aap airlines yaa real estate se judaa samaj dekh daalate hai, ant main pataa chalata he wo pichley bees second se gutkha bechnaa chaah rahe the
 Many times, even after looking at it completely, it is not understood whether the next pickle is wanting to sell or is telling the characteristics of the dining table
 showers ke vigyaapan main akashganga najar aa sakati he
 In a soap advertisement, he takes a bath everywhere, in ice water, on a mountain spring, in a camel's ring, except in the bathroom of the house
 adventuras sports se judaa har vigyaapan ant main colddrink kaa nikalataa he
 Seeing such advertisements, it is known that Choleza is also needed to drink cold drinks, but even stronger than it is to find logic hidden behind such advertisements
 sabase zyada dhokhaa garbhanirodhak utpaada dete hai
 The heart breaks when it is finally revealed that the advertisement seen so keenly is not about strawberry ice cream or fruit beer
 kanfusion sirf is baat kaa nahin ki mardon ke shaving fom ke vigyaapan main ladakiyon kaa kya kaam yaa hair jail ke vigyaapan main bear baar kyon dikhaaya ja rahaa he, kanfusion is baat kaa bhi rahata he ki sabase chota asi bechate jija-saalon kii shakl ek si kaise ho sakati he?tis par bhi aam aadmi ko agar kisi ne sabase zyada pareshaan kiya he to wo he deodorant ke vigyaapan
 Even after filtering the entire market, the deodorant does not get the top, which on sprinkling, many girls leave the temptation of clothes and fall on the body of a man
 koi uthaa bhi liya, to use chhidke badan par ek mari makkhi na bhinakati he
 Earlier people used to take a bath in the summer, there was no need of deodorant
 jo na nahaate the, wo paseene se naha jate the
 Here consumer awareness advertisements have also made a difference
 graahak thaga janaa nahin chahta, gas or bina gas ke deodorant main fark samajhnaa shuru karata he
 Here the customer understands the difference between gas and no gas, then the next one asks him how many sprays in a can? The big question is that we should be prepared for such questions because the next question will be whether or not alcohol is in the deodorant
 pehle to mujhe samaj hi nahin aata tha ki log alcohol vaale deodorant ko pasand kyon nahin karte? muft kii alcohol kise pasand na aegi, bhale wo kahin bhi kaise bhi mili ho? phir samaj aayaa nahin alcohol vaala deodorant lagaana utana hi galat he, jitna mard hokar auraton vaala telkam powder yaa deodorant lagaana
 Not only wrong, it is disgusting, shameful
 pehle mujhe lagata tha satraa kaa pahaada sabase mushkil he
 Then felt that geography is the most difficult after eighth, then realized the mood of girls is the most difficult
 par ab meri ankhen khul chuki hai
 If there is something difficult, just find a deo that does not contain alcohol, no gas, more spray and smells of men
 safalataa ke myne pehle jo rahe hon, aaj to bas vahi safal he, jisane tamaam kasautiyon par khara utarataa dio khoj nikaala

 Suddenly the dead are disappearing from a cemetery in Noida adjacent to Delhi
 koi he jo kabr khodta he or murde nikaal kar le jaataa he
 But before knowing this whole story of Noida, know the shocking story of a cemetery in Pakistan
 ek shaks kabristaan main kaam karata tha
 But she always kept an eye on the women's shoes
 jaise hi kisi aurat ko vahaan dafnaaya jaataa wo shaam dhalate hikbar khod karkabr main utar jaataa
 Then the dead would complete their lust with women
 pakade jane ke baad usne khud kabool kiya ki wo 48 murda auraton ke saath kabr main utar kar aisa kar chukaa tha
 Hearing this, the hair gets erect
 kaise-kaise jehani biimaar log hai is duniya main
 For the past few months, corpses have been stolen continuously from a graveyard in Noida near Delhi
 log apano ko dafnane ke baad peeche mudate nahin ki murdon kaa serial chor laash chura kar le jaataa he
 But he steals only the children's lacquer
 wo bhi dafnane ke 24 ghante ke andar hi
 In the last 10 days, three corpses have disappeared from here and in the last six months more than six corpses, that too of children
 aakhir murdon kii chori ke peeche kya he rahasy?kabristaan se laashon ke gaayab hone kaa ye ajeeb silsilaa tab saamne aayaa, jab sector 9 kaa rahane vaala ek parivaar yahaan apni 8 maheene kii beti kii laash dafna kar gaya
 a four and a half feet deep grave was excavated to bury the corpse
 kafan main lapet kar puure reeti-rivaaj ke saath use kabr main rakhaa gaya
 For protection, a platen was put and then the soil was also covered and covered
 taaki kabr or laash donon mahfuj rah sake
 But the next day when this family again came to read namaz-e-janaza for the girl, seeing the condition of the grave, the ground slipped under their feet
 kafan ne badal di jaanch kii disha
 
 
 The tomb was carved and the dead body of the girl was missing, but how was it possible
 kareeb saadhe chaar feet gahare kabr ko khod kar patra hataa kar koi raaton-raat laash kaise gaayab kar saktaa tha, wo bhi tab jab kabristaan har taraf charadivari se bhi ghira he or chaukeedaar raat ke kam se kaam aath baje tak yaheen maujuud hota he
 Seeing the footprints of some dogs nearby, at first sight some people suspected that the corpse might have been taken out by the dogs, but the way the corpse had no far-fetched mark, the matter got entangled
 Gone
 kyonki agar ye karatuut jaanwaron kii hoti, to laash ke kuch tukade yaa phir khun ke chhinte aas-paas jarur pade hote
 But right now the victim family and the cemetery watchman were talking on the incident that Maulana Saheb, who came to teach Namaz, caught sight of something that everyone was shocked to see
 darasal, khudi kabr ke paas bacchee kaa kafan baqayada tah laga kar koi rakh gaya tha
 Obviously, this was not possible for animals to do
 10 dinon main gaayab hui hai teen laashen
 
 kabristaan ke chaukeedaar ne unhen ek aisi baat bataai ki unka shaq or bad gaya
 The matter became even more complicated
 kabristaan se laash kii chori kii ye pehali or iklauti vaardaat nahin thi
 In the past 10 days, likewise, 3 corpses had been dug up and stolen from here and more than six in six months
 or ittefaq se ye teenon kii teenon laashen bacchon kii hi thim
 The case was very serious, so the family who lost the child's body reached the police but when the police investigation went ahead, many more shocking things came out one after the other
 kya ho saktaa he laashon kii chori kaa makasad?sawaal uthta he ki aakhir laashon ko churaane ke peeche kisi serial chor kaa makasad kya ho saktaa he? noida ke is kabristaan se laashon ke gaayab hone kaa ye rahasyamayi silsilaa koi abhi se nahin, balki maheenon se chal rahaa he
 The only difference is that due to the disappearance of three corpses one by one within the last ten days, this case has now made people very restless
 haalat ye he ki yahaan se laashon ke gaayab hone ke is silsile ko dekhte hue kai pariwaron ne to laash dafn karne ke baad kabristaan main hi ek-do raaten guzari hai
 Has given guard logon kii maane to is dauraan to unhenraat ke andhere menkabristaan main kuch bhi atapata nahin dikhaa, lekin jab-jab paharaa nahin diya gaya, tab-tab kai maukon par laashen gaayab ho gayi
 And all the bodies that disappeared by chance were children
 yani is kabristaan se jo bhi laashen chura rahaa he, wo naa sirf bacchon kii laashen chura rahaa he, balki nai laashen chura rahaa he
 This modus operandi of this serial thief of such cases has come before, has made the case even more complicated
 is modes oprendi kii badaulat nikaali jane vaali laashon kaa gunaahagaar kai tareekon se istemaal kar saktaa he or in tareekon main sabase upar he
 There can also be no denial of the hand of a necrophibic person, such a distorted mentality, who wants to have a physical relationship with the corpses as well
 jurm kii duniya kii puraani kahaniyon main par jaaen, to is duniya main aise kai maamle saamne aae hai, jinamein necrophibic logon ne laashon kii bekadri kii he
 
 
 No need to go too far
 
 
 haal main dilli ke begumpur se giraftaar hue serial repist ravindra kii kahani kuch aisi hi thi, jisane kai ladakiyon ko agava karne ke baad unka katl kiya or phir laashon ke saath jyaadati kii
 Similarly, the fact that Nithari's convict Surendra Koli was necrophobic did not come to light, but he did kill him in an attempt to do the most with the girls
 tantra-mantra yaa kaala jadookabristaan se laashon ke gaayab hone ke peeche sabase zyada logon ko tantra-mantra kaa hi shaq he
 Because there have been many cases of tantric activities with corpses, and the way the corpses are disappearing as recently as possible, most people are on the side of the Shaktantrikas
 kuch logon ko lagata he ki laashon kii chori ke peeche medical training bhi ek vajah ho sakati he
 It is possible that such corpses are being used for training children in a medical college or institute and someone is stealing corpses from here and supplying them further
 shaq to canibalism yani jehani taur par vikrut kisi aise shaks kii taraf bhi he, jo murde kha saktaa he
 Obviously, in the investigation of this case, the police has opened all the options, but the curtain is yet to be removed from Raj
 ye baat ajeeb lag sakati he
 But when the whole matter is strange then what to say about any one thing? This is the reason why some people see a deep conspiracy behind these dead bodies disappearing from this cemetery
 sajeesh kabristaan se logon ko dur karne kii
 This can also be a big reason
 
 
 noida ke sector 18 main maujuud is kabristaan kaa istemaal log saalon se kar rahe hai
 But there has also been a legal battle over the cemetery land
 ek paksh jahaan kabristaan kii jameen ko apana bataa kar is par daawa karata rahaa he or murdon ko dafn karne se rokna chahta he, vahiin duusari ore kabristaan kii intezamiya cameti is par apana haq jataati he
 In such a situation, some people are beginning to see a deep conspiracy behind this disappearance of dead bodies
 unhen lagata he ki shaayad koi jaanboojh kar kabr se mauka milte hi bacchon kii laashen chura le jaataa he, taaki log iskabristaan kaa rukhkarna band kar den
 And these are the people who do not want this land to be used as a cemetery
 vaise isse pehle bhi jurm ke kai maamalon main kai aise gunaahagaar or aisi vajahen achaanak police ke saamne aati rahi hai, jinke bare main koi aamtaur par soch bhi nahin saktaa or aise main jab is kabristaan kii jameen ko lekar vivaad he or kuch logon ko laashon ke gaayab hone ke sajeesh kaa shaq bhi kuch aisa hi he
 This is also the failure of the police intelligence system
 
 
 kabristaan se laashon ke gaayab hone ke maamle kii jaanch kar rahi sector 39 thane kii police puri tarah andhere main he
 You can call it Noida Police's failure, the result of taking the case lightly or something else
 lekin hakeekat yahi he ki takreeban 15 dinon kaa vakt guzarane ke baavjood police ke haath khaali hai
 And the condition is that the burials in the grave after losing the bodies of their innocent children are stumbling rate for justice
 yahaan tak ki unke paas apane gujarey hue apano ke liye fatiha padhane kii ek adad jagah tak nahin he
 Actually, since there is no boundary wall of the cemetery, there is no such thing as protection of the graves here
 aise main laashon ke gaayab hote hi aam taur par din ke vakt chaukeedaari karne vaale log aksar sara thikra aawaara kutton ke sir par phod dete hai lekin jis tareeke se laashen gaayab hoti rahi hai, usase in maamalon ke peeche kutton kii harakatein kam, insaanon kii hi zyada lagati hai
 It is impossible for dogs to come out of the corpses by digging such deep tombs
 
 
 upar se kuton yaa aise hi kisi duusare jaanavar ke laash nikaalane par laashon ke tukdon kaa aas-paas padaa hona lajimi he lekin yahaan maamla bilkul ulta he

 haalanki mana ja rahaa he ki navjot siddhu apni press conference main kisi party main shaamil hone kaa elaan shaayad nahin karenge kyonki aam aadmi party sutron kaa daawa he ki is press conference ke bare main unako koi jaankaree nahin he
 Anyway, it is also a matter of fact that if Sidhu joins you, then that press conference will be called by you and not Sidhu
 tippaniyan There is a possibility that Sidhu should keep his focus on BJP in the press conference in Delhi on Monday and tell why the party that gave him identity in politics, twice the Lok Sabha ticket of Amritsar and recently the membership of Rajya Sabha Left
 
 The Significantly, Sidhu resigned on Monday

 Making Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar a Janata Dal (united) candidate victorious in his native Nalanda district is a matter of political prestige, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi's four cabinet ministers are also at stake
 patna sahib se ravishankar prasad, patliputra se ramkripal yadav, aara se aar ke singh or baxur se ashvini choube kii siyaasi kismat kaa faisla matadaata ravivaar karenge
 At the same time, the reputation of former Union Minister and RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha will also be tested in this phase

 In this election, Misa and Union Minister Ramkripal Yadav once again have a fight
 misa ke prachaar ke liye lalu prasad kii anupasthiti main bhai tejasvi or maa or purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ne morcha sambhala he
 Both the candidates are Yadavs, but if the Lalu Yadav's name manages to get the sympathy of Tejashwi Yadav in favor of Misa, then Union Minister Ramkripal may face difficulties
 misa ko vampanthi matadaataaon kaa bhi samarthan milane kii sambhaavna he, jabaki ramkripal ko gathbandhan ke anya dalon ke vot bank or pradhanmantri ke chehre par bharosa he
 Nalanda, the home district of Bihar Chief Minister, also remains a seat of prestige
 is seat par kabja barkaraar rakhane ke liye na keval mukhyamantri nitish kumaar, balki puraa rajg prayasarat he
 The Chief Minister is also engaged in attracting voters through several election meetings in Nalanda

 Kohli scored another century in the third ODI against Australia, scoring 123 off 95 balls but the Indian team lost by 32 runs
 kohli is siries main do shatak or ek 40 se adhik kaa score bana chuke hai
 Bangar said, "it is not that we depend on one player
 lekin, viraat ne apane khel kaa str itnaa ooncha uthaa liya he ki kai baar dusron kaa acha pradarshan bhi khaas nahin lagata

 ’ BSP President Mayawati termed bjp's disgusting electoral conspiracy to clamp down on CBI SP President Akhilesh Yadav over illegal mining case in Uttar Pradesh
 mayawati ne is sambandh main akhilesh yadav ko phone karke kaha ki ye bijepi kaa purana hatkandaa he, jo apane virodhiyon ke khilaaf aajamaati rahati he
 In this way, the SP has got the support of the Congress as well as the BSP
 vahiin, duusari or somvaar ko sapa ke mahasachiv ram gopal yadav or basapa ke satish chandra mishra ne joint press confeence karke bijepi par karaara hamalaa bolaa
 Satish Chandra Mishra defended Akhilesh, saying that the CBI was being misused to distract from the issues
 bijepi kii hataasha kaa alam yah he ki modi sarkaar ne sibiai se gathbandhan kar liya he
 Today these people have demolished an institution like CBI
 sapa mahasachiv ram gopal yadav ne kaha ki abhi sapa-basapa kaa gathbandhan hua nahin he usase pehle hi sarkaar ne sibiai ke tote ke saath gathbandhan kar liya he
 The CBI is being misused before the election at the behest of the central government
 sapa or unke sahyogi agar sadak par aa gaye to bijepi waalon kaa sadak par chalanaa mushkil ho jayega or modi ko banaras chhodkar duusari seat se chunaav ladanaa pad jayega
 The Congress has also expressed strong opposition to the cbi's action against Akhilesh Yadav
 congress ke rajyasabha saansad gulam nabi aaazaad ne bhi modi sarkaar par sibiai ke durupyog kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki yah pehali baar nahin ho rahaa he
 This action has been initiated against Akhilesh Yadav after 5 years, just before the election, so that the alliance is not formed or the alliance does not lead to victory

 gauratlab he ki bahari dilli se saansad rahe kumaar kii agrim jamaanat kii yachika kal nichali adaalat ne khaarij kar di thi
 Sajjan Kumar's lawyer Anil Sharma has said in the appeal that the lower court wrongly dismissed his bail plea on the ground that only the court which has issued summons can grant bail
 nichali adaalat ne sajjan kumaar kii yachika yah kehete huye khaarij kar di thi ki ‘phase vailu’ dekhakar lagaaye gayi aaropon ko puri tarah se galat bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The court, in its 38-page order, said that not a single specific reason was given in Sajjan's plea to make the accused eligible for anticipatory bail
 adaalat ne kaha ki aropon kii sachaai ‘maamle kii sunwaayee kaa vishay’ he or tathyon se pataa chalata he ki inamen kuch dam he
 The CBI had filed a charge sheet on 13 January for allegedly making inflammatory speeches against 13 people, including Kumar, in two separate cases of anti-sikh riots in 1984 after the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

 In terms of merits on all fronts of cricket, the Indian team is the best team in the World Cup but it does not mean that they will win the World Cup
 itihaas uthaakar dekhen to paaenge ki hameshaa sarvshereshth team ne hi cap jeeta ho, jaruri nahin; iske bajaae myne yah rakhata he ki aapane vishwa cap ke dauraan awwal cricket khelaa ho or haa, jab aap nock-out maichon main hote hai, to bas chand ghanton kaa ukvada pradarshan aapako trophy tak pahunchaa detaa he
 Irrespective of the conditions, India appears to be in the 50-over format
 aaie ham vishwa cap main bharat kii sambhaavnaaon ke akalan se pehle uske pratidwandviyon kaa akalan kar len
 i choose Australia, England and New Zealand as India's main rivals
 australia vishwa cap main koi bhi ulatpher kar saktaa he
 a few months ago the Australian cricket team looked scattered, but suddenly its World Cup team looked extremely organized and strong
 australia ne kai khaamiyon ko durust kiya he or david warner or steve smith kii vaapasi se team sambhavit champion ke rup main dikhti he
 Since Australia have been world champions several times and after their return to form in England, it is believed they would have been confident of winning again
 newjiland vishwa cap main hameshaa newjiland kii tarah hi rahegaa
 a team adorned with enthusiastic players will obviously give their best; If she wins she will be shocked in a way, but no one can deny that from year to year it remains the most liked team in the world
 england kaa pradarshan simit overon ke cricket main ashanuroop nahin rahaa he
 The continuity with which England has a presence at the international level has been nonexistent
 lekin unke paas dikhaane ke liye 2010 main jiti world tii-20 championships ke alaava kuch bhi nahin he
 England are being seen as the biggest contenders this time due to their recent performances in odis and then the World Cup on their own ground
 isse inkaar nahin ki england ne apane khel par bahut dhyaan diya he lekin unamem chizon ke bare main bahut zyada soch-vichaar karne or sthiti ko jatil bana lene kii pravriti bhi dekhi gai he
 Excellence in any sport is achieved only by teams and 1-1 players who rely on their intelligence and practical intelligence to keep things simple, like Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 england main yahi khubi nahin he, isi vajah se vah champion banane or vishwa cricket main westeindies yaa australia kii tarah dhak nahin jamaa paaya
 Now return to India
 england main champions trophy main pakistan ke haathon final main mili haar ke baad bharat kii 50 overon kii team ke saath vastav main kuch acha hua to vah tha yujavendra chahal or kuldeep yadav kaa team main pravesh
 Both came into the team and became an integral part of it
 tab se bharat kii jeet kaa graph chadh rahaa he
 During the spin bowling of Ashwin and Jadeja, India were not getting much wickets in the middle overs
 iskaa matlab tha ki aakhri overon main hameshaa set ballebaaj, ballebaaji karata tha or bahut se ballebaaj abhi khilne ko baaki hote the
 India's poor fast bowlers failed to stop the batsmen scoring indiscriminately in the death overs and the game went out of India's hands
 chahal or kuldeep ke aane se bharat ne adhikansh wicket bich ke overon main nikaale jiskaa matlab he ki deth over ke gendbaajon par ab kam dabaav rahata he, jinamein ab duniya ke sarvshereshth gendbaajon main se ek jasprit bumara or ek phir se ubharate tej gendbaaj mohammad shami shaamil hai
 Chahal and Kuldeep have been game changers with Virat and Bumrah
 haalanki ab is jodi ke liye zyada wicket jhatakna utana aasaan nahin rahaa kyonki duniya gendbaaji kii unki yuktiyon ko samaj gai he or ballebaaj unke overon main besabri dikhaakar koi jokhim nahin lenaa chahenge
 Nevertheless they will be India's major weapons in the World Cup mission
 rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan ke rup main ek divasiy maichon main bharat ke paas number 3 par khilne ke liye viraat kohli ke rup main sabase mahaan ballebaaj maujuud hai, jo ranon kaa ambara hi nahin khadaa karte, jeet kii raah taiyaar karte hai
 During this time many records are broken
 aaie ab is vishwa cap main bharat kii sabase badi kamajori-number 4 se number 6 tak kii ballebaaji—kii baat kar lete hai
 India may field Vijay Shankar at number 4, but they are completely unaware of the number 4 batting in the 50-over game
 vikalp bhi bahut utsahjanak nahin hai
 Perhaps these are early indications that bowling may show more depth than India's batting in the near future
 is tarah bharat ke purv vishwa cap vijeta captain dhoni number 6 par ballebaaji ke liye utrenge
 Everyone knows that his best days are behind, but he is a big force of the team as a wicketkeeper and batsman
 dhoni is khel ke ab tak ke sabase mahaan finishron main se ek hai jo abhi bhi apane tareeke se is khel ko anjaam tak pahunchaana chahenge lekin unke tarkash main jo tir hai, aaj ve puraane pad chuke hai
 This bothers me because his great mind thinks that it can still be done as it used to be
 2011 ke ulat is samay bharat kaa sabase vishwasaneey pahalu uski gendbaaji he or usamen itane vikalp hai ki kuch maichon main bhubaneshwar kumaar jaise shandaar gendbaajon ko aaraam dena pad saktaa he
 If India had the same position in batting, then its team would not have been the most invincible team in the World Cup

 The AAP has created a furore after the defeat in the MCD election
 ek taraf kumaar vishwaas ke uthaae sawaalon par kejariwal sarkaar main mantri kapil mishra samarthan karte najar aae, vahiin duusari taraf jamiyanagar se vidhayak amanatulla khan ne vishwaas ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 According to the MLA, Kumar Vishwas is involved in a conspiracy to split the party
 amanatulla khan kaa vishwaas par vaimantulla khan ne kaha, 'kumaar vishwaas ji aam aadmi party ko hadapna chaahate hai or party ko todna chaahate hai, wo apane ghar par vidhayakon ko bulaakar kah rahe hai ki mujhe party kaa sanyojak banawaao nahin to bijepi main chalo
 BJP is ready to give Rs 30 crore to each one '
 vishwaas par party todane kaa gambhir aaropazamiya se AAP vidhayak ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ye sab bijepi ke ishaare par ho rahaa he or is kaam ke liye inhone 4 vidhayak chode hue hai
 These four mlas take the AAP mlas to the house of Kumar Vishwas, this was confirmed by all the mlas of the AAP
 yahi nahin, shanivaar ko ek mantri ke yahaan in chaaron vidhayakon ke bich baithak bhi hui
 According to Amanatullah Khan, like Kumar Vishwas, Yogendra Yadav was also plotting against the party
 vishwaas ke bayaan se kapil mishra sahamaumantulla ke aarope se pehle kejariwal ke mantri kapil mishra kumaar vishwaas kii tarafdaari karte dikhe
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, he said that there will be a radical change in the party, because all the mlas, ministers and workers want this
 jo baar-baar haar ke liye zimmedaar rahe hai unhen ghar main baithna chahie'
 The minister stated clearly that all aspects of the defeat will be reviewed
 saath hi shungalu cameti kii report par party main manthan zarur hona chahie
 According to Kapil Mishra, Kumar Vishwas who is speaking and Kejriwal who is tweeting, both leaders are saying the same thing
 kumaar vishwaas ke intervyuu ke baad kaaryakartaaon main josh aayaa he, kyonki unhone kaaryakartaaon kii awaz ko manch diya he
 In the conversation with Vishwas on Aaj Tak, Kumar Vishwas said that the AAP Congress is becoming
 kapil kii maane to kumaar vishwaas ne ye bayaan gusse main diya he, kyonki AAP kii vichaardhaara anti bijepi or congress he
 Kapil Mishra said that Kejriwal had correctly questioned the surgical strike
 narendra modi ke khilaaf desh me himmat karke sirf aam aadmi party bol sakati he, or ham aage bhi bolte rahenge
 Talking about the defeat now, Kapil Mishra said in response to a question that Kumar Vishwas was not campaigned in Punjab, Delhi and we lost, it will also be reviewed
 mantri ne bharosa diya ki aam aadmi party main bada badlaav hona sunishchat he
 He flatly denied that there was a breakdown in the party
 vipaksh par hamalaa karte hue kapil mishra ne kaha ki manoj tiwari ko khuli chunauti detaa hum ki wo party ko tod kar dikhaaen
 Not only this, Kapil Mishra said that many of bjp's winning councilors and mlas are in touch with his party

 The current week is no less than a lottery for political journalists
 
 
 pehle lagaataar petrol or dijal kii badhati keemten surkhiyon main raheen
 The price of oil is skyrocketing
 
 The public is upset, hope is raised from the government that perhaps the government should give some mercy
 magar kendra sarkaar ne jaraa bhi raahat dene se manaa kar diya
 At present, the Central Government levies an Excise Tax of about Rs 20 on the price of petrol, while the State Government levies Rs 17 as VAT
 
 
 jabaki asli keemat ek litre petrol kii hoti he kareeb saadhe 40 rupee
 Similarly, the central government levies tax of Rs 15 on diesel and the state government of Rs 10
 jabaki ek litre dijal kii keemat he kareeb 44 rupee
 In other places, including social media, there has been a lot of criticism from the government that why the central and state governments do not reduce their tax
 tab jaakar kuch rajya sarkaron ne ekaadh rupaya prati litre daam kam kiya
 People started putting old videos on social media of BJP leaders, including the Prime Minister, about what he used to say when oil prices went up during the UPA era
 ek tarah se soshal media par sarkaar pichhadati najar ai
 
 duusari badi khabar rahi is hafte kii- dollars ke mukaable rupee main lagaataar giravat
 The rupee went across 72 rupees
 sarkaar kaa phir bayaan aayaa ki ham is par kuch nahin kar sakate, yah vishwavyaapee halaat kii vajah se ho rahaa he or dollar har karency ke mukaable majboot ho rahaa he
 On social media, there was a flood of old videos about how the BJP leaders had made some statements during Manmohan Singh
 darasal bijepi ne or khud pradhanmantri ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main tel kii badhati keemat or rupee kii giravat ko chunavi mudda banaaya tha
 Then a news came from Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank, that the worst bank loans were given to industrialists during the UPA
 is par bavaal much gaya
 BJP and social media fell behind Congress
 magar baad main yah bhi pataa chalaa ki maujuuda endie ke samay usase zyada lone diya gaya he
 On this too, the BJP and the Congress's Tu tu-main i started
 phir faraar mehul chaukasee kaa ek video aa gaya jisamen vah rota dikh rahaa he or sarkaar par fansaane kaa aarope laga rahaa he
 Even though no one is trusting his tears, he too has eaten up a lot in the media
 
 It is not yet week that Vijay Mallya met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in 2016 before fleeing India, saying that the biggest bomb blasts of the news was
 yah khabar aisi thi jo bijepi ko na to nigalate ban rahi or na ugalate
 Jaitley Ji's instant statement came that i had met Mallya for only 40 seconds
 
 But in the political perception, the damage to the BJP was done
 soshal media phir sarkaar ke peeche lag gaya
 The government once again appeared on the backfoot
 duusare din congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or vijay maalya ke sambandhon or congress dwaara kingfisher airlines kaa muft main istemaal karne kaa aarope lekar bijepi aa gai
 On this, the Congress President himself appeared in a press conference and this time a witness had also brought PL Punia
 puniya ne khulaasa kiya ki jab jetali or maalya kii mulaakaat ho rahi thi to ve sansad ke central haul main maujuud the or unki mulaakaat paanch minute se lambii chali thi
 Punia claimed that if the government wants to make public the CCTV camera footage of the Central Hall and make it public, this will clear the whole thing
 punia ne kaha ki yadi unki baat sach nahin hui to ve raajnneeti se sanyas le lenge
 The comments ab sarkaar ek baar phir back foot par aa gai he or phir soshal media uske peeche padaa he
 
 
 Today, in the social media that is perceived to be under control or used, BJP seems to be lagging behind
 usee kii dawa kaa istemaal congress usee ke khilaaf kar rahi he

 At present the price of petrol is about Rs
 20 / - as excise tax while the state government levies Rs
 17 as VAT
 
 
 jabaki asli keemat ek litre petrol kii hoti he kareeb saadhe 40 rupee
 Similarly, the central government levies tax of Rs 15 on diesel and the state government of Rs 10
 jabaki ek litre dijal kii keemat he kareeb 44 rupee
 In other places, including social media, there has been a lot of criticism from the government that why the central and state governments do not reduce their tax
 tab jaakar kuch rajya sarkaron ne ekaadh rupaya prati litre daam kam kiya
 People started putting old videos on social media of BJP leaders, including the Prime Minister, about what he used to say when oil prices went up during the UPA era
 ek tarah se soshal media par sarkaar pichhadati najar ai
 
 duusari badi khabar rahi is hafte kii- dollars ke mukaable rupee main lagaataar giravat
 The rupee went across 72 rupees
 sarkaar kaa phir bayaan aayaa ki ham is par kuch nahin kar sakate, yah vishwavyaapee halaat kii vajah se ho rahaa he or dollar har karency ke mukaable majboot ho rahaa he
 On social media, there was a flood of old videos about how the BJP leaders had made some statements during Manmohan Singh
 darasal bijepi ne or khud pradhanmantri ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main tel kii badhati keemat or rupee kii giravat ko chunavi mudda banaaya tha
 Then a news came from Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank, that the worst bank loans were given to industrialists during the UPA
 is par bavaal much gaya
 BJP and social media fell behind Congress
 magar baad main yah bhi pataa chalaa ki maujuuda endie ke samay usase zyada lone diya gaya he
 On this too, the BJP and the Congress's Tu tu-main i started
 phir faraar mehul chaukasee kaa ek video aa gaya jisamen vah rota dikh rahaa he or sarkaar par fansaane kaa aarope laga rahaa he
 Even though no one is trusting his tears, he too has eaten up a lot in the media
 
 It is not yet week that Vijay Mallya met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in 2016 before fleeing India, saying that the biggest bomb blasts of the news was
 yah khabar aisi thi jo bijepi ko na to nigalate ban rahi or na ugalate
 Jaitley Ji's instant statement came that i had met Mallya for only 40 seconds
 
 But in the political perception, the damage to the BJP was done
 soshal media phir sarkaar ke peeche lag gaya
 The government once again appeared on the backfoot
 duusare din congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or vijay maalya ke sambandhon or congress dwaara kingfisher airlines kaa muft main istemaal karne kaa aarope lekar bijepi aa gai
 On this, the Congress President himself appeared in a press conference and this time a witness had also brought PL Punia
 puniya ne khulaasa kiya ki jab jetali or maalya kii mulaakaat ho rahi thi to ve sansad ke central haul main maujuud the or unki mulaakaat paanch minute se lambii chali thi
 Punia claimed that if the government wants to make public the CCTV camera footage of the Central Hall and make it public, this will clear the whole thing
 punia ne kaha ki yadi unki baat sach nahin hui to ve raajnneeti se sanyas le lenge
 The comments ab sarkaar ek baar phir back foot par aa gai he or phir soshal media uske peeche padaa he
 
 
 Today, in the social media that is perceived to be under control or used, BJP seems to be lagging behind
 usee kii dawa kaa istemaal congress usee ke khilaaf kar rahi he
 And the biggest thing is that the week is not over yet, let's see what happens next

 The other big news this week was the steady decline in the rupee against the dollar
 rupaya ludhakte-ludhakte 72 rupee ke paar chalaa gaya
 The government again came a statement that we cannot do anything on this, it is happening due to the global situation and the dollar is getting stronger against every currency
 soshal media par phir puraane video kii baadh aa gai ki manmohan singh ke samay kis tarah bijepi netaaon ne kya-kya bayaanbaji kii thi
 In fact, the BJP and the Prime Minister themselves had made the rising price of oil and fall of rupee an election issue in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 phir ek khabar ai rigerv bank ke purv governor raghuram rajan kii taraf se ki upie ke samay sabase zyada kharaab bank lone udyogpatiyon ko diya gaya
 There was a ruckus on it
 bijepi or soshal media congress ke peeche pad gaya
 But later it was also revealed that more loans have been given at the time of the current NDA
 is par bhi bijepi or congress kii tu tu-main main shuru ho gai
 Then comes a video of absconding Mehul Choksi in which he is seen crying and accusing the government of cheating him
 bhale hi koi bhi uske aansuon par bharosa nahin kar rahaa, magar vah bhi media main bharpoor jagah kha gaya
 
 abhi haftaa khatm nahin hua he ki khabaron kaa sabase bada bam phoda vijay maalya ne, yah kahkar ki bharat se bhaagane ke pehle 2016 main unhone vitt mantri arun jetali se mulaakaat kii thi
 This news was such that neither the BJP was swallowing nor spewing
 jetali ji kaa turant bayaan aayaa ki main to sirf 40 second ke liye maalya se mila tha
 
 magar rajnatik dharna main jo nuksaan bijepi ko hona tha vah ho chukaa
 Social media then followed the government
 sarkaar ek baar phir baikfoot par najar ai
 On the second day, the BJP came back with allegations of relations between Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Vijay Mallya and the Congress using Kingfisher Airlines for free
 is par khud congress adhyaksh saamne aae ek press conferes main or is baar ek gavaah bhi saath laae the piel puniya ko
 Punia revealed that when Jaitley and Mallya were meeting, he was present in the Central Hall of Parliament and their meeting was over five minutes long
 puniya ne daawa kiya ki sarkaar chaahe to central haul kaa sisitivi camera kaa footage mangakar saarvajanik kare, isse sari baat saaf ho jaaegi
 Poonia said that if he does not come true, he will retire from politics
 tippaniyan Now the government has once again come on the back foot and then social media is behind it
 
 
 jis soshal media ko kaabo main yaa kahen istemaal karne main bijepi paarangat maani jaati he, aaj usee main vah pichhadati najar aa rahi he
 The Congress is using the same medicine against him
 or sabase badi baat he ki abhi haftaa khatm nahin hua, dekhte hai aage-aage hota he kya-kya

 This time there will be Lok Sabha elections in 7 phases (2019 Election) and the results will be out on 23 May
 mukhya chunaav ayukta sunil aroda ne press conference main isaki ghoshnaa kii
 With the announcement of election dates, the Congress intensified the offensive against the BJP
 rajasthan ke mukhyamantri or congress ke varisht netaa ashok gahalot ne kaha ki modi ne jis tarah kaa vyavhaar vipaksh or sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ke saath kiya usase yahi lagata he ki desh or samvidhan khatre main he
 In 5 years, Modi has not said anything that touches the people, he talks with a jerk like an actor is acting, in that form Modi introduced himself and crores crores in publicity
 unhone kaha ki modi agar bollywood ke actor hote to zyada kaamyaab hote
 i do not know what worked
 rahul gandhi kaa zikr karte hue gahalot ne kaha ki modi ko sapane main bhi rahul gandhi dikhte hai, raat din rahul gandhi or unke khandaan ko koste rahete hai
 a new government will be formed in the country on 23 May, the time has come for change
 siem gahalot ke mutabik aaj dar or aatank kaa maahaul he
 People do not want to talk on the phone
 whatsap par baat hoti he
 Replying to the media's question, he said that the media should also work under pressure after the dates are announced
 agar modi ke 2014 ke pehle vaale bhaashan chalaa den to congress ko prachaar karne kii jarurat hi nahin
 He said that Modi speaks double meaning, which does not suit the Prime Minister
 sena ke shaury par shaq karne kaa aarope lagaate hai
 this is wrong
 rahul ne pulavama ke baad kaha ki ham sarkaar ke saath hai
 Modi should appreciate the role of the opposition
 jabaki wo chunaav jeetne ke liye dhyaan bhatka rahe hai
 If the world is questioning air strikes, then the opposition's job is to ask questions
 amit shah aankada de rahe hai jabaki vaayu sena pramukh ne koi aankada nahin diya
 Gehlot blamed PM Modi for the delay in announcing election dates
 unhone kaha ki chunaav ayog kii manshaa thi 4 taarikh ko chunaav kaa elaan karne kii lekin modi ke udghaatan kaarykram ke kaaran deree hui
 Coalitions take place before and after elections
 jarurat ke hisaab se gathbandhan hoga
 If SP-BSP is looking after his interest then we should appreciate it
 vahiin congress mahasachiv ne bhi bijepi or piem modi ko nishane par liya
 He said that today Congress and Opposition are united
 hamen vishwaas he ki ham modi sarkaar ko haraayenge
 This government has failed to fulfill every promise
 khate main 15 lakh, kisaan kii aay badhaane, rojgaar, mahila suraksha sabhi morche par sarkaar fail rahi he
 a fake propaganda is being done to cover it
 unhone kaha ki is sarkaar ne sampradayik nitiyon ke jariye logon kaa baantne kaa kaam kiya he
 We will go and talk to the people
 badlaav kaa vakt aa gaya he
 On 23 May, people will choose a new government
