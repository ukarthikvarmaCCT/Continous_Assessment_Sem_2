 The laddus are tied, while the cake is cut in contrast
 saaf he ki angrejiyat insaanon ko kaatna sikhaati he or bhartiya samskruti jodna

 During a program on Sunday, Mulayam Singh Yadav said that the party will not form any alliance with anyone and will contest the elections alone
 siem ummidavaar ke sawaal ko bhi talasirf gathbandhan hi nahin balki chunaav ke baad agle siem ke naam ko lekar bhimulaayam singh yadavane sawaal ko taalte hue kaha, ye bhi koi sawaal he? mulaayam singh yadav ravivaar shaam lakhanu ke gomti nagar main ek nijee kaarykram main shirkat karne panhuche the
 In response to a question there, Mulayam fired a coalition balloon in one stroke
 seat bantwaare kaa formula aayaa tha samanikhilesh yadavaur shivpal yadav camp kii ore se lagaataar ye kaha ja rahaa tha ki gathbandhan par netaji faisla lenge
 The news of the alliance has now come to light, according to sources
 congress ko 88 siten dene or samaajawaadee party ke 303 siton par ladane tak kii baat aa gai he
 But this atmosphere created for three days has come to a complete stop
 amar singh kii prashanth kishor se najdiki ko dekhte hue atakalon kaa bazaar garm tha lekin jaisaa hota rahaa mulaayam singh ne garm lohe par chot kii or gathbandhan ke sabhi charchaaon par viraam laga diya
 Now it has to be seen what Akhilesh Yadav does, because Akhilesh Yadav is constantly saying that if there is an agreement with the Congress, more than 300 seats will be won

 Sheila Dixit, the Prime Minister to the head of Delhi, also lives here
 isliye bijli ke daam par bhi sabase zyaada meharbaani yaheen dikhaai jaati he
 Where in the rest of Delhi, the first 200 units were priced at 3 rupees 70 paise, whereas in this slab, only 3 rupees living in New Delhi will pay 10 paise
 duusare slab yani 200 se 400 unit ke liye aam dilli vaala 4 rupye 80 paise bharegaa vahiin nai dilli main rahane vaale viipi sirf 4 rupye 10 paise denge
 For units above 400, where the rate of 6 rupees 40 paise has been fixed in the whole of Delhi, for New Delhi, only 5 rupees 15 paise
 baat bas itani bhar nahin he aam dilli or nai dilli ke antar kii hi nahin he
 Rather, we have to tear Delhi down on the issue of electricity prices
 yani jinaki jeb main kam paisa he wo zyaada bill chukaayen or jo paise vaale hai wo kam
 The question of the difference in electricity prices seems a puzzle
 isliye mukhyamantri shila dikshit ke karyaalay tak ko is par safai deni padi he
 The CM office says that New Delhi gets cheaper electricity at government rate, so it is in profit, while in New Delhi, electricity is wasted less due to theft
 is safai ke baad bhi aam dilli vaala yahi sawaal puch rahaa he ki jab puri dilli main ek hi sarkaar he to nai dilli kaa phayda bas uskaa kaise hua

 But once he has faced even a court martial
 shanivaar ko dilli ke ek aspataal main arjan singh kaa nidhan ho gaya
 Yes court martial, which the soldiers have to face who break the rules of the army
 ek aisa samay aayaa tha jab vaayu sena ke marshall arjan singh ko vayusena kaa niyam todane par court marshall kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 It was time before independence, when the command of the army was in the hands of the British
 yuva arjan singh ne farvari 1945 main kerala ke ek ghar ke upar bahut nichi udaan bhari
 He then faced charges of breaking Air Force rules
 unke upar aarope tha ki unhone civillian kii jaanon ko bhi jokhim main daalaa
 Arjan Singh however faced a court martial
 unhone apane bachaav main jo baat kahi, uske baad unka court marshall nahin hua
 According to a post published in a newspaper, at that time Arjun Singhkannur was posted on Kent Air Strip
 unhone udaan bhari or aircraft lekar sidhe corporel ke ghar ke upar pahunch gaye
 They landed the ship fairly low
 kai baar corporel ke ghar ke chakkar lagaae
 In such a situation, not only the corporators' houses came out on the streets, but the whole locality was gathered
 trephic jam lag gaya
 Let me tell you that it was a big thing to see airplanes at that time and people there had seen airplanes only once before
 yah logon ke liye to kaaphi maje kii baat thi, lekin british prashasan ko yah baat pasand nahin ai or shikaayat oonche afasaron tak pahunchi or arjan singh ko court marshall kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 At that time, the number of trend pilots was quite small
 duusare vishwa yuddh kii vajah se aise bhi british sena ko kaabil payalton kii jarurat thi
 In such a situation, the British army could not even court martial of talented pilots like Arjan Singh
 court marshall kaa saamana karne ke dauraan arjan singh ne bahes karte hue kaha tha ki unhone train payalat kaa manobal badhaane ke liye aisa kiya
 Let us tell you that it is said that this trainee pilot was Air Chief Marshal Dilbag Singh who later became Air Chief Marshal
 dilbagh singh 1981 se 1984 tak bhartiya vaayu sena ke pramukh the
 He was the second Sikh after Arjan Singh to become the Chief of the Indian Air Force
 dilbagh singh ko 1944 main ek payalat ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Let us tell you that Arjan Singh is known for his bravery and never giving up
 vah sainya parivaar se talluk rakhte hai
 In such a situation, he had a different love for the army since childhood

 bijepi ke ek saansad ne kaha ki jidipi se jaruri he aam aadmi kaa sthaayee kalyanis par ek bahes shuru ho gai ki kya vastav main jidipi kisi desh ke vikaas kaa paimaana hachaalu vitt varsh kii duusari timahi main jidipi growth kaa aankada 4
 5 per cent has reached 5 trillion economy to achieve the target, a sharp increase in GDP is necessary
 a statement by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Nishikant Dubey has brought the issue to a boil amidst the falling GDP figures of the country
 nishikant dube ne kaha ki jidipi se adhik jaruri he aam aadmi kaa sthaayee aarthik kalyaan hona, jo ho rahaa he
 Opposition has become aggressive on this statement of Dubey
 iske baad is par ek bahes shuru ho gai ki kya vastav main jidipi kisi desh ke vikaas kaa paimaana he? aaie vistaar se jaanate hai ki kya hota he jidipi or kyon he yah mahatvapurn
 In the Lok Sabha recently, Nishikant Dubey said that GDP came in 1934, before that there was no GDP, it is not true to consider GDP as Bible, Ramayana or Mahabharata and there will not be much use of GDP in future
 vitt varsh 2018-19 main desh kii sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) growth rate 6
 Was 8 percent
 chaalu vitt varsh (2019-20) kii duusari timahi main jidipi growth kaa aankada 4
 Has reached 5 percent
 yah kareeb 6 saal main kisi ek timahi kii sabase badi giravat he
 The government is emphasizing on the goal of a $ 5 trillion (about Rs 350 lakh crore) economy by 2025
 is lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye sarkaar ko jidipi growth kii raftaar bhi tej karne ke liye kaam karnaa hoga, lekin abhi arthvyavastha kii jo raftaar he uske hisaab se yah dur kii kaudi lagati he, isi vajah se jidipi ko lekar sawaal-jawaab tej ho gaye hai
 GDP is the biggest measure of a country's economic development
 agar jidipi badhata he to iskaa matlab he ki arthvyavastha zyada rojgaar paidaa kar rahi he
 It also means that the economic prosperity of the people is increasing
 kya hota he gdpkisi desh kii seemaa main ek nirdhaarit samay ke bheetar taiyaar sabhi vastuon or sevaaon ke kul maudrik yaa bazaar mulya ko sakal gharelu utpaada (GDP) kehete hai
 It is a comprehensive measurement of a country's domestic production and it shows the health of a country's economy
 isaki gananaa aamtaur par salanaa hoti he, lekin bharat main ise har teen maheene yani timahi bhi aanka jaataa he
 a few years ago, separate services like education, health, banking and computers were also added
 jidipi do tarah kii hota he nominal jidipi or real jidipi
 Nominal GDP is the sum of all figures at current prices, but the effect of inflation in real GDP is also adjusted
 yani agar kisi vastu ke mulya main 10 rupee kii badhat hui he or mahangaai 4 fisadi he to uske real mulya main badhat 6 fisadi hi maani jaaegi
 For the five trillion economy that the central government has said to make the country, the current price i
e
 nominal GDP has been made the basis
 antarrashtriya mudra kosh ke anusaar april 2019 tak bharat kaa kul jidipi (nominal yani maujuuda keemton par) 2

 duniya ke kul jidipi main bharat kaa hissaa kareeb 3
 36 percent
 isi prakaar bharat kaa real jidipi (2011-12 kii sthir keemton par) 140

 However, the modern concept of GDP was first introduced by Simon Kunget in 1934 for the US Congress Report
 kunjet ne kaha ki ise kalyankari kaaryon ke maapan ke rup main nahin istemaal kiya ja saktaa
 However, it was only after the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 that GDP began to be used to measure the economies of countries
 pehle jidipi main desh main rahane vaale or desh se baahar rahane vaale sabhi nagarikon kii aay ko joda jaataa tha, jise ab gros neshnal product kaha jaataa he
 What is the connection of GDP to the common people? GDP figures also have an impact on the common people
 agar jidipi ke aankade lagaataar sust hote hai to ye desh ke liye khatre kii ghanti maani jaati he
 Due to lower GDP, the average income of the people decreases and people go below the poverty line
 iske alaava nai naukariyaan paidaa hone kii raftaar bhi sust pad jaati he
 The possibility of retrenchment increases due to economic slowdown
 vahiin logon kaa bachat or nivesh bhi kam ho jaataa he
 Why is GDP trusted? Criticism of GDP data is in this case that it cannot be considered a measure of standard of living
 isaki ek acchhee baat yah he ki ise samay-samay par aksar timahi jari kiya jaataa he or duniya bhar main isko maapne kaa paimaana lagbhag ek he
 But its limitation is that many things are not included in it, like it does not include the earnings of citizens or companies moving out of the country
 iske alaava isamen bazaar se baahar hone vaale lenden ko maapna sambhav nahin hota
 For example, if Mohan bought 10 kg of guava from Ram by giving 10 kg of his grain, then this transaction could not become a part of GDP from anywhere
 yani jin deshon main cash yaa bazaar main lenden kam hoti he, unka jidipi aankada hameshaa kam hi aayega
 GDP also does not show how much income inequality is there between rich and poor of the country
 isaki sabase badi seemaa yahi he ki jidipi ghatane yaa badhane se yah pataa nahin chal paata ki vastav main logon kaa kalyaan bhi ho rahaa he yaa nahin
 Poverty did not come down even in the era of rapid growth of around 10% of the UPA government
 isi ko aadhaar banaakar ab kai log kah rahe hai ki jidipi par bahut zyada jor dena ek tarah kii bevakoofi he
 Simon Kuznets stated in his first report of the US Congress in 1934 only that until the information about the distribution of personal income is obtained, it cannot be a true measurement of whether the economic welfare of the people has been done
 kaise hoti he jidipi kii gananajideepi ko maapne kaa antarrashtriya maanak book system of neshnal accounts (1993) main tay kiya gaya he, jise SNA93 kaha jaataa he
 It has been prepared by representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations and the World Bank
 bharat main jidipi kii gananaa timahi-dar-timahi hoti he
 Agriculture, industry and service in India are three important parts, on the basis of which GDP is determined
 iske liye desh main jitna bhi production hota he, jitna bhi vyaktigat upbhog hota he, vyavsaay main jitna nivesh hota he or sarkaar desh ke andar jitne paise kharch karti he use jod diya jaataa he
 Apart from this, the total imports (the things sold for abroad) are subtracted from the total imports (the things which are imported from abroad)
 jo aankada saamne aata he, use bhi upar kiye gaye kharch main jod diya jaataa he
 This is the GDP of our country
 jab jidipi main rashtriya jansankhya se bhaag diya jaataa he to prati vyakti jidipi nikalati he
 First is the base year
 yani aadhaar varsh
 What was the production of the country in a base year, how much has it increased compared to this year? The rate of this decrease and increase is called GDP
 jidipi kaa akalan desh kii simaaon ke andar hota he
 That is, the calculation will be done on the same figure, which is produced in our country
 isamen sevaayen bhi shaamil hai
 That means things imported from outside have no major hand in GDP
 jidipi rate main giravat kaa sabase zyada asar garib logon par padataa he
 Economic inequality in India is very high
 isliye aarthik vruddhi dar ghatane kaa zyada asar garib tabake par padataa he
 This is because the average income of the people decreases
 nai naukariyaan paidaa hone kii raftaar ghat jaati he
 In FY 2018-19, the per capita monthly income was Rs 10,534
 salanaa 5 fisadi jidipi growth kaa matlab he ki vitt varsh 2019-20 main prati vyakti aay sirf 526 rupee badhegi
 Who decides GDP The responsibility of measuring GDP rests with the Central Statistics Office ie Central Statistics Office under the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation
 yah offis hi puure desh se aankade ikattha karata he or unki calculation kar jidipi kaa aankada jari karata he

 Orders have been given to remove the battery rickshaw on Delhi roads for the last 2 years
 dilli chif secretary kii trephic police or parivahan vibhaag ke bich hui meeting ke baad ye faisla liya gaya
 There are many ways to go from one place to another in Delhi
 auto, bas, metro, cycle rickshaw
 But in the last few years, battery-powered rickshaws became part of the daily routine on the streets of the capital
 ye aise rickshaw hai jo motor whical act ke andar nahin aate kyonki parivahan vibhaag main inkaa registration nahin kiya jaataa he
 At present, the Chief Secretary of Delhi has directed to seize all these battery-powered E-rickshaws
 puri dilli main kareeb dedh lakh E-rickshaw chalate hai
 About 4 rides can be accommodated in a rickshaw
 lekin rickshaw chaalak manamaani karte hue zyada sawari rickshaw main bitha lete hai
 This increases the risk on the ride
 ek taraf agar E-rickshaw ko sadakon se hataa diya jaataa he to isse safar karne vaale logon ko ek jagah se duusari jagah jane main pareshaani hogi
 However, some riders feel that they will be comfortable if the battery rickshaw gets off the road
 vahiin, bydaree rickshaw chalaane waalon ko lagata he kii isse unke rojgaar par asar padegaa
 On the other hand, the rickshaw pullers have formed their organization and filed a petition in the High Court
 aise main dedh lakh i-rickshaw ko sadakon se hataanaa itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 It remains to be seen what decision the Delhi government takes next

 There is bad news for backward class executives working in public sector companies, banks and insurance companies
 ab unke bacchon ko sarkari naukariyon or admician main aarakshan kaa phayda nahin mil sakegaa
 The government has made significant changes in the rules of OBC reservation in the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, after which now the officials of psus, banks and insurance companies have also joined the creamy layer
 krimi layer main aane vaale logon ko aarakshan nahin miltaa he
 Till now the rule of creamy layer was applicable only in central government jobs
 desh main kareeb 300 sarkari companiyaan hai
 If public sector banks and insurance companies are also included in this, then the decision will affect millions of families
 is faisle ke bare main bataate hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki ye faisla pichley 24 saalon se lataka hua tha or in sansthaanon main kaam karne vaale aise varisht adhikariyon ke bachche bhi aarakshan kaa galat phayda uthaa rahe the jinhen darasal krimi layer main aana chahie
 The result was that the lower level employees whose children were actually entitled to reservation were being killed
 ab niyamon main badlaav karke is galati ko sudhaar liya gaya he
 But in the last 24 years in government companies, banks and insurance companies, the posts that were not recognized could be considered as creamy layer
 isliye inamen kaam karne vaale tamaam pichley varg ke adhikariyon ke bachche bhi iskaa phayda uthaa rahe the
 Also read: - Modi government is exploring the possibility of quota in OBC quota, the commission has been created
 Now the government has identified those posts, whatever their income, will be considered as part of the creamy layer and their children will not get reservation
 jaise sarkari companiyon main kaam karne vaale manager, akjicutive level ke adhikari ab e grad ke adhikari maane jaaenge or aarakshan nahin milegaa
 Children of officers of Junior Management Grade Scale 1 and above in banks, financial institutions and insurance companies will no longer get the benefit of reservation
 cabinet ne pichley hafte hi faisla kiya tha ki krimi layer kii seemaa 6 lakh salaana se badhaakar 8 lakh rupee kar di gai he
 That is, the people whose annual income is above 8 lakh will now come in the creamy layer and their children will not get the benefit of reservation
 saath hi yah faisla bhi kiya tha ki obisi aarakshan ke cote ke bheetar kota tay karne ke liye ek samiti banaai jaaegi
 That is, there is also the intention that the castes which are grabbing the most part of the OBC reservation should be curbed

 Pakistan's Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani has warned the US that it would have to think 'ten times' before taking unilateral military action in the North Waziristan tribal region
 ‘di express tribune’ akhbaar neek khabar main kayaani ke hawaale se kaha, ‘america aisa kar saktaa he lekin iske liye use das baar sochna hoga, kyonki pakistan iraq yaa afghanistan nahin he
 Kayani said these things while informing the members of the two parliamentary committees about the national security situation in the General Headquarters yesterday

 Kayani made this statement when an MP asked him to comment on the possibility of an American attack in Pakistan, like Laos and Cambodia
 haalanki ‘don’ akhbaar ke anusaar kayaani ne ‘uttari wajiristaan main sheeghra hi ekatarfa america sainya karrwai’’ kii sambhaavna se inkaar kiya he
 Kayani did not say anything about Pakistan's reaction to such a possible situation, but he reminded lawmakers that the country had become a nuclear power and should not be compared to Iraq and Afghanistan, the Dawn newspaper reported
 udhar ‘express tribune’ ke anusaar kayaani ne yah mana he ki america uttari wajiristaan main sainya karrwai karne ke liye pakistan par dabaav bana rahaa he
 Kayani said, according to the newspaper, "we have made it clear to the US that we will decide the timing of any such action based on our position and capabilities
" hamane unhen yah bhi bataaya ki samasya kaa kaaran afghanistan he
 Kayani said, "if anyone can assure me that everything will be corrected by taking action in North Waziristan on our behalf, then i will take prompt action
" ’ unhone kaha ki pakistan ne varsh 2010 main hi afghanistan par apane rukh se america prashasan ko likhit taur par avgat kara diya tha, lekin america ne abhi tak apana rukh spasht nahin kiya
 An MP told the 'dawn' newspaper that Kayani has refuted US accusations that Pakistan is using the Haqqani group for a proxy war in Afghanistan
 pakistan kii afghanistan par niyantran karne kii khwaahish sambandhi dharna par kayaani ne kaha, ‘jab britain or soviet sangh aisa karne main asafal rahe, to pakistan se aisi apeksha kaise kii ja sakati he? hamaare paas dusron ke asafal kaaryon main safal hone ke liye koi jaadu kii chadi nahin he
 'he said that relations between countries are determined according to certain principles and' no one should be allowed to cross this border line

 hamaare paas vikalp hai, hamaare paas beshumaar vikalp hai," sena pramukh general bipin ravat ne pichley saal india today ke saath baatcheet main pakistan main baithe aatankwaadiyon ke sansanikhej hamale par apni pratikriya dete hue yahi batdoharaai thi
 He reduced the possibility of surgical strike-2 on the lines of cross-border raids by Special Military Forces in 2016
 sena ke ek varisht adhikari kaa kahana he, ''ek baar kii gai karrwai dushman ko zyada satark kar detii he kyonki vah jaanata he ki aage kya hone vaala he
 This increases the risk
 " ek aatmghaatee hamale main siarpief ke 40 javaanon kii hatya ke ek din baad 15 farvari ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne uttar pradesh ke jhaansi main ek raily main ghoshnaa kii ki ''hamaari senaaon ko nirnay kii puri aazaadee de di gai he
 "A senior Army official says that it is clear that retaliation will be from the Army and not from the Air Force or Navy, and that would mean a major level action
 bharat ne pakistan ko antarrashtriya birdari main alag-thalag karne ke liye apane kootnithik prayaas shuru kar die hai
 It has withdrawn the status of Most Favored Nation or Most Preferential Country given to Pakistan, and an atmosphere is being prepared for blacklisting in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which creates many new problems in front of the troubled Pakistani economy
 Which will be very difficult for him to handle
 saath hi ek sainya vikalp par bhi gambhirtha se vichaar chal rahaa he
 Army officials say that the choice of time for military action is also an important aspect
 aisi kai vajahen hai jo yah sanket de rahi hai ki sainya karrwai ho sakati he
 US National Security Advisor John Bolton telephoned his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval on 15 February, agreeing to India for every retaliation on his behalf
 sheet yuddh ke ranneetikaar harman kaan ne 44 paaydaanon vaale ek sopan ke jariye yah samajhane kii koshish kii he ki kis prakaar sanyukt rajya america or uasasar ke bich choti-choti ghatnaayen ek aise purna yuddh main badal sakati hai jo niyantran se baahar ho saktaa he
 In a 2011 study Rodney Jones produced a 'nuclear Escalation Laders in South Asian Report on the prospects of war between India and Pakistan
 unhone bharat or pakistan ke bich 18 paaydaanon vaala ek sopan banaaya jisamen kaan ke 44 paaydaanon vaale sopan kii tarj par purv-yuddh, paaramparik yuddh, purv-parmaanu or parmaanu yuddh kii sthitiyon kaa puraa khaakaa khinchaa gaya tha
 India's strategists will aim to prevent military action from turning into a conflict or even a limited war
 is baat kii bahut adhik sambhaavna he ki niyantran rekha ke paar, pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir (pioke) main sainya karrwai ko lakshith kiya jayega or bharat kaa aisa maananaa he ki yahi kshetra pakistan kaa dil he, na ki punjab praant
 India's response may therefore be below the fifth rung of Jones's prepared ladder (see why full war is not an option)
 krooj missile se hamalaa yaa phir hawaii hamale jaise vikalp mushkil ho sakate hai kyonki ve shatrupaksh ko teevr pratikriya dene ke liye or pratishodh ke liye aamantrit kar sakate hai
 Former director-general of Artillery, Lecrittinant General p
 ravishankar kehete hai, ''ham kis tarah se pratishodh lenge yah puri tarah se is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki ham kis tarah ke parinaamon ke liye taiyaar hai or uskaa kya prabhaav hoga
 If we choose to perform firepower as a mere missile attack, then Pakistan can do so in return
 yadi hamaara prahaar hamaari sainya kshamta ke anuroop nahin hoga, to yah bhartiya sena ko sharminda karegaa
 "that is, in such a situation no option is risk-free anymore
 jabaki general ravat kehete hai ki unhone raajnneetik netritv ko spasht kar diya he ki unhen kisi bhi prakaar kii karrwai ke liye aadesh miltaa he, ve us par aage badhenge, bhale vah kitna bhi kathin kyon na ho
 However, they are also fully conscious of some of its other facts
 ranneetikaron main se ek ne baatcheet main kaha, ''bhartiya sena ne 2016 main niyantran rekha paar kar karrwai karke pakistan kii sena ko achambhit kar diya tha
 "but the Pakistani armed force is now more circumspect
 yani iskaa matlab he ki unhone apni sabhi shuruaati chetavanee pranali ko sakriy kar diya hoga
 Indian Air Force aircraft flying in search of Pakistani checks and bunkers along the Line of Control will be on full alert to prevent aerial attack, so Indian Navy warships soaring in the Arabian Sea will be on full alert Their reconnaissance aircraft will be ready for search
 is baar bharat ke saamne ek aisa shatru khadaa milegaa jo puri tarah se taiyaar he or jisane jawaab kii dhamkee bhi di he
 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said this openly
 iskaa arth hoga ki ab aage koi bhi sainya karrwai hoti he to usamen logon kii jaan jaaegi
 This is the reason why it is difficult for the government to choose any option and whatever military option is chosen, how far it can reach growing, it is difficult to say
 2016 kii sargical strike ko anjaam tak pahunchane vaale sena kii uttari kaman ke commander rahe leftinent general dies hooda (sevanivrutt) kehete hai, ''har vikalp par charchaa hogi
 How far are we willing to go and how much are we willing to bear the loss of goods and goods
 in sari buniyadi baton par bahes hogi
 But this discussion will not stop here; It will also have to be analyzed what we will do on the retaliatory action from the enemy side
 "yadi sarkaar vastav main ardh-paaramparik gupt vikalpon ko aajamaane kaa nirnay karti he, to vah 155 mimi topon se niyantran rekha par sthit aatankwaadi thikaanon or launch pad ko dhwast kar sakati he
 The type of commando raids conducted in 2016 will be difficult to replicate as the Srinagar-focused 15 Corps, covering 450 km of the 750 km of the loc, is currently under massive snow cover And it will be very difficult for him to cross the border and do the operation
 sargical strike ke baad niyantran rekha ke saath maujuud sookhe naalon par pakistani sena ne bade paimaane par anti-personal mins bichhaakar kai raaston ko band kar diya he
 In the same way, the possibility of trying options such as surface-to-surface bombardment of brahmos missiles and airstrikes on terrorist targets seems unlikely
 hamaare vimaan bina niyantran rekha ko paar kiye bhi sateek hawaii hamalon se lakshya ko dher karne main sakasham hai, jaisaa ki unhone kargil yuddh ke dauraan kiya tha
 Former Chief of Air Force Air Chief Marshal Fali Major also says that the biggest challenge in taking accurate action through such attacks is to have accurate intelligence about the target
 unke shabdon main, ''jaankaree sateek honi chahie kyonki aap jo hamalaa karte hai usamen aapaki taraf se nagarikon ke jaan-maal kaa baari nuksaan nahin hona chahie
 "the biggest challenge here is to gain real-time intelligence on the activity of terrorists, including Maulana Masood Azhar and the other leaders of jaish-e-mohammed (JM)
 hawaii hamalon ke saath ek badi pareshaani yah he ki ve sthiti ko jald hi kaaphi tanaavpurn or andolit kar denge or is baat kii bahut zyada ashanka rahegi ki pakistani vaayu sena javaabi karrwai kare
 If he did so, a lot would depend on the extent to which the Indian government showed the courage to risk in the situations that followed the attack
 yah ek yaksha prashn he jiskaa uttar kisi ko nahin pataa
 In short, no decision about the military action by the Government of India is going to be such that it is safe and which does not hurt itself

 Attacking Lalu, Modi said that demonetisation has got public support but its benefits are not understandable in RJD supremo
 lagaataar duusari baar centre kii satta par pakad banaae rakhane ke liye bhartiya janata party (bijepi) edi chotii kaa jor laga rahi he or iske liye uski sabase badi ummid uttar pradesh par tiki he
 In 2014, this state was instrumental in bringing Narendra Modi to power, and this time too BJP is expecting a lot from this state
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki bijepi satta virdohi lahar kaa zyada asar na pade, isliye vah apane kai saansadon kaa tikat kaatane main lagi he
 20 seats are yet to be announced
 If we look at the names of the candidates announced so far for Uttar Pradesh by the Bharatiya Janata Party, it becomes clear
 ab tak die gaye 60 tikaton main 20 saansadon ke tikat yaa to kaate gaye yaa badal die gaye yani ek tihaai bijepi ke saansadon par party ne surgery kii he
 If you look at the list of BJP, BJP has cut the ticket of 16 mps while the seats of four mps have been changed
 abhi 20 siton par elaan hona baaki he, haalanki in bache siton main se kuch siten sahyogi dalon ke liye bhi ho sakati hai
 Many big-ticketed faces The big mps whose tickets have been cut by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, both in Katekendra and in the state, include Kanpur MP and BJP veteran Murali Manohar Joshi, Deoria MP Kalraj Mishra and Jhansi MP Uma Bharti Huh
 inke alaava rampur se doctor nepal singh, sanbhal se satyapal, hathras se rajesh divakar, fatehpur se sikri babu laal, shahjahanpur se krishna raaj, hardoi se anshul verma, mishrikh se anju bala, itawa se ashok dohare, prayagraj se shyama charan gupta, barabanki se priyanka ravat, baharich se savitri bai phule, kushinagar se rajesh pandeya or baliya se bharat singh hai
 The BJP has changed the seat of 4 mps, besides cutting the ticket of 16 mps, the Lok Sabha constituency of 4 mps has been changed
 party kii ore se jin 4 saansadon ke rankshetra main badlaav kiya gaya he, usamen menka gandhi ko pilibhit se sultanpur, ram shankar katheria ko agra se itawa, varun gandhi ko sultanpur se pilibhit or virendra singh mast ko bhadohi se baliya bheja gaya he
 Strategy to field only Jitau candidates, however, among these 16 mps whose tickets have been cut, Uma Bharti from Jhansi and Kalraj Mishra from Deoria are mps who had already declared not to contest
 haalanki abhi 15 se zyada bijepi ke cote se siton kaa elaan hona baaki he or kai tikat bache hue 20 siton main bhi katenge, lekin jis tareeke se party ne tikat bantwaare ko lekar surgery kii he, usase saaf dikhataa he ki bijepi ne sirf jitau ummidavaar utaarne kii apni ranneeti banaai he or isi par kaam kar rahi he
 The atmosphere is not like 2014, compared to 5 years ago, this time the path is not looking easy for the BJP, due to the changed political equation in the state and it has to make a new strategy
 bijepi main ummidavaaron main jis tareeke se tikat kaate gaye hai, usase yahi lagata he ki party ke liye bas ek hi mul mantra bachaa he or vah he yen ken prakaren party kii jeet sunishchit ho
 Those who have seen Raj kapoor-waheeda Rehman's famous film 'teesri Kasam' on Phanishwar Nath Renu's story 'killed Gulfam', will remember that his bullock how the carriage Hiraman got into trouble due to the bamboo being loaded in cart
 Stuck and swears that he will never carry bamboo in his car again
 mushkil tha bans kaatnazyaadaatar log yah maanate hai ki ye to filmi kahani he
 But do you know that till now it was really legal work to get into a carriage with bamboo in your car
 ab se pehle jangal ke baahar kahin se bhi bans ko kaatna or use ek rajya se duusare rajya main le janaa behad jhamele kaa kaam tha or iske liye rajya sarkaron ke van vibhaag kii anumati kii jarurat padati thi, jo aasaani se nahin milti thi
 The reason for this was a 90-year-old stereotyped PITA law of India
 bans kaa utpaadak hone ke baavjood taiwan se ayaatadarasal vigyaan ke hisaab se bans ekpedanhin ek ghaas he
 But according to the Indian Forest Act of 1927, bamboo was considered a tree and except bamboo grown in the forest, cutting bamboo from somewhere else and moving it to another place was illegal in the eyes of forest department
 isaki vajah se bans ugane vaale rajyon main kisaanon ko bevajaah pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha kyonki wo bans ko naa to aasaani se kaat sakate the or naa hi use bech sakate the
 Due to this absurd law, despite China being the second largest producer of bamboo in the world after China, India also had to import bamboo from Taiwan for small things like incense sticks
 khaastaur par purvottar ke rajyon main jahaan bans khub ugaaya jaataa he or kaaphi istemaal kiya jaataa he, vahaan ke logon ko khaasi pareshaani ho rahi thi
 There was a long-standing demand to change this law, which was finally met on Wednesday
 loksabhaa main mili sanshodhan ko manzooreeloksabhaa ne buudhvaar ko indian forest act 1927 ke kanoon main sanshodhan ko manjuuri de di, jiske baad bans ko ab pedo kii shrenee se hataa diya gaya he
 Now, there will be no restriction on growing or cutting bamboo even in areas outside the forest, because now according to the law, bamboo is not a tree but only a grass
 adhyadesh laakar ped kii shrenee se hataaya gaya tha bansisse pehle 23 november ko hikendre sarkaarne ek adhyadesh laakar bans ko ped kii shrenee se hataa diya tha
 Then on Wednesday, the government introduced a bill in the Lok Sabha to legalize this ordinance, which passed easily
 kai udyogon main istemaal hota he banskaagaj or furniture banane samet kai aise udyog hai, jahaan bans kaa khub istemaal hota he or ummid kii ja rahi he ki kanoon main badlaav ke baad bans ke utpaadan or khapat donon main baari badhotaree hogi
 a new round of bamboo growing and selling is expected to begin after the government's decision, especially in tribal areas

 'yogi bole, 'congress desh kii suraksha ke saath hameshaa samjhauta karti rahi he, raksha saude main ghotaale karnaa yahi makasad rahaa he

 Investigation revealed that some of the empaneled hospitals are evading treatment of Ayushmann patients

 What does the modicare portal say? All small and big information related to this program is available on the website of Ayushman Bharat
 har rajya main koun koun se aspataal panel par hai or koun koun si bimariyon ke ilaaj ko wo cover karte hai
 Specific codes of prescribed treatment have also been given in front of the names of the hospitals, which are to be made available to the beneficiaries on their behalf

 teen talaak ke baad supreme court pahunche halaala, bahuvivaah, muta or misyar (contract marij) ke maamalon ne islam main auraton kii sthiti par phir dhyaan khinchaa he
 The Supreme Court had given the verdict on triple talaq on the basis of the Quranic system and that is the reason why its opposition was blunt
 halaala kaa quran or haddees main kahin ullekh nahin he
 Polygamy is a conditional option but not an imperative
 muta or misyar vivaah apwaad bhar hai
 Then why is there noise about them? On the four petitions in these cases, the Supreme Court has sought a response from the Central Government, asking to constitute a constitutional bench
 in muddon se jude kai ahm sawaal uth rahe hai
 The big question is whether Muslims are being kept ignorant of Quranic arrangements under the guise of religious intervention
 What is the motive behind this? In fact, in order to remarry the divorced husband, the woman has to marry another man and then divorce him and this process is called halala
 quran main surah al-baqar kii ek aayat 231 kaa saar he, "jab tum auraton ko talaak de do or unki iddat avadhi (teen maah das din) puure hone ko aa jaae tab yaa to bhale tareeke se unhen roak lo yaa bhale tareeke se unhen vidaa kar do
 It is too much to not hold them just for the sake of persecution
 ''aayat 232 kaa saar he, "pehle shuhar se talaak ke baad aurat shaadi kar leti he lekin doosraa shuhar bhi use talaak de detaa he yaa mar jaataa he tab aurat ke iddat avadhi puri kar lene ke baad agar donon (purv pati-patni) ko paraspar vishwaas he to ve phir ek ho sakate hai
 "halala is not mentioned in both places in the Quran, so why its imperative?" a divorce or death from the second husband is also a coincidence for the first husband to remarry and there is no purpose in marrying the first husband by taking a divorce
 anjuman minhaj-e-rasul ke adhyaksh moulana saiyad atahar hossain dehalavi kehete hai, "agar do baar talaak dene ke baad shuhar ne bivi ko teesri baar talaak de diya to vah aurat uske liye halaal nahin hogi
 Some clerics made this issue "halala", which is a crime
 '' sharia vishleshak anwar ali edwocket kehete hai, "yah managasaint vyavastha vyabhichaari logon kaa aniatik upaay he, jo islam, samaaj or naitikta ke vipareet he
 "now there is neither this round nor this system in the Gulf countries
 lekin bharat jaise loktantric desh main aise masalon par saamaajik yaa kanoonee bahes kii kyon jarurat pad rahi he? ali kehete hai, "vastav main yah un yon shoshakon kaa chatur upaay he jo muslim samaaj ko sanhmaarg se bhatkata he or dushkarm yaa asthaayee vivaah kii taraf le jaataa he
 "muta and missyar are also temporary marriages with fixed-term contracts
" isamen meher kii raashi bhi tay kii jaati he
 Meher is also fixed in the usual nikah, which the wife is required to pay before making a physical relationship for the first time
muta and Misiyar automatically expire on completion of the marriage period
 yah ek tarah kii contract marij hi he
 Muta Shia and Misari are the practice of Sunni Muslims but in Indian male society this exceptions are not found 
 bengal, maharashtra or andhra pradesh main aane vaale khadi deshon ke kuch muslim paryatak apane pravaas kii avadhi ke dauraan is tarah kii contract marij karte hai
 Greed and illiteracy is a big reason for thick amount in the form of Meher
 muta yaa misyar ke pairokaar tark dete hai ki aise vaivaahik sambandhon se utpann santan ko pita kii sampatti main saamaanya shaadi ke baad utpann santan kii hi tarah baraabar kaa kanoonee haq he
 But by this logic, a muta or missar marriage cannot be made Shari
 bahuvivaah ke mudde par saamaanya rup se quran or haddees ke hawaale se tark diya jaataa he ki islam main chaar patniyaan rakhana jaij (kanoonee) he
 Its strict conditions are also hindered in the concept of four wives
 taiyab trust devband ke pravaktaa moulana shahanvaj badar kaasmi kehete hai, "patni biimaar he, banjh he, pati kii shaareerik jarurat puraa karne main sakasham nahin he to pehali patni kii sahmati se vah duusari shaadi kar saktaa he
 There are similar conditions on third and fourth marriage
 ''teen talaak ke baad ab halaala, muta, misyar or bahuvivaah ke maamle sarvocch adaalat main kanoonee bahes kaa hissaa hai
 The three judges in a five-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, which together declared the decision to declare triple talaq as unconstitutional, were Justice R
 epa
 Nariman, Justice Uday Umesh Lalit and Justice Kurian Joseph had said that three divorces at a time are contrary to the instructions of the Quran
 to phir virodh kyon?supreme court ne "halaala'' or "bahuvivaah'' ko chunauti dene vaali yachikaaon ko soochibaddh karne par vichaar karne ke liye 2 july ko sahmati jataa di he
 One of these petitions is Dr Sambhal of Uttar Pradesh
 samina begum ne daayar kii he
 She is a mother of three children and has suffered three divorces twice
 pehle pati ne chitthee bhejkar or duusare pati ne phone par ek hi baar main unhen teen talaak kahkar chhod diya
 The first marriage took place at Batla House in Delhi and the second at Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh
 ve pehali mahila hai jinhone teen talaak ke saath hi bahuvivaah, halaala, muta or misyar jaise muddon par bhi supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 She jumped into this fight when her second husband divorced her in 2012
 bakaul samina, "in masalon se peedit bahut si auraten mujhe milin to maine kanoonee ladaai kaa faisla kiya
 divorce-e-bidaat (now banned by the Supreme Court) is not only in the Quran, but is divorce-e-ahsan (divorce in three different periods)
 ''teen bacchon ke saath dilli main rah raheen samina apni ladaai ko anjaam tak pahunchaana chaahati hai
 He is also angry with the alleged clerics who intimidate Muslims in the name of religion
 ve kahati hai, "jo log hamaari yachikaaon ke peeche aresas yaa bhaajapa kaa haath bataa rahe hai, ve quran kaa adhyayan karen
 We are demanding what the Quran says
 '' haalanki quran or haddees kii roshni main jo baaten samina kahati hai, kamobesh vahi baaten ulema bhi sweekaar karte hai
 But Sameena definitely asks a question, "when i am talking about the Quran and seeking protection on the same basis from the law, then why are my opposing and Muslim community being misled by making irrational arguments?" That Sameena has told the Supreme Court that she is being threatened for withdrawal of the petition and on the same basis, her advocate has listed the petition before the Constitution Bench for final decision

 The Supreme Court, however, has not set any date for hearing the case
 supreme court in yachikaaon ko pehle hi samvidhan peeth ke paas bhej chukaa he
 The bench has also allowed Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to file a reply submitted by the Center
 —em
 Riyaz Hashmi "there is no hypothesis of nikah halala in Islam nor in Sharia
 teen talaak ke baad vaivaahik sthiti khatm ho jaati he
 Men and women are destined for each other
 talaak ke baad aurat kisi duusare mard se shaadi kar le or sanyog se duusare mard ke saath bhi uskaa nirvaah nahin ho sake
 If the man dies or she divorces too, she can marry her former husband
 lekin yah koi yojanabaddh prakriya nahin he
 So the petitions filed in the Supreme Court are only to mislead
 is maamle main supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko jo notice jari kiye hai, us par sarkaar ko chahie ki vah islamic vidwaanon or sansthaaon se vimarsh ke baad jawaab daakhil kare

 In the proposed meeting of the Muslim Personal Law Board in Lucknow on July 15, these cases of the Supreme Court will also be considered for an advance strategy as to how the board should become a party and clarify its position
 ''dow
 Qasim Rasul Ilyas, Member, All India Muslim Personal Law Board "muta and Misiyar marriages were occasional arrangements which are not practiced in India
 bahuvivaah bhi islam kii buniyadi aasthaa main shaamil nahin he
 Some people try to prove such issues by focusing on the religion of Islam as if all the evil practices are in the Muslims
 pehle pati se shaadi karne ke liye duusare mard se shaadi karke talaak lenaa gunaah he
 "maulana Syed Athar Hussain Dehalvi, President, Anjuman minhaj-e-rasool" i am also a Muslim and i have studied the Quran and Hadith deeply
 jis majahab main aurat ko izzat or barabari kaa haq he, usamen kuch kathith maulavee in adhikaron ko dene se rokte hai
 The Supreme Court declared triple talaq as unconstitutional and even according to the Quran this was not the way
 jab ulema or personal lau board quran or haddees ko maanate hai to supreme court main yachikaaon kaa virodh kyon? ham bhi to quran ke anusaar hi vidhik or sanvaidhanik sangrakshan kii maang kar rahe hai

 haalanki beti ab bhi aspataal main hi admit he

 ek italvi-chini medical team duniya kaa pehla mastishk pratiropan china main karne kii yojana bana rahi he
 Amid the ongoing debate over medical ethics, a surgeon from the team that carried out this transplant has claimed that it is going to be the world's first brain transplant
 rain or unke saathi italian sarjan sarjeeo kanavero ko ummid he ki is prakriya kii koshish do saal ke bheetar kar di jaaegi lekin yah tabhi mumkin he jab shuruuaati shodh or test yojanabaddh tareeke se ho paaen
 Rain told the news agency AFP, 'the media thinks that we will do this surgery by 2017 but this is possible only if one step before that is taken as per the plan
 ' Kanavero, who heads the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group, announced the project in 2013 and said the process would be possible by 2016 at the earliest
 lekin anginat rukaawaton or faasalon kii vajah se yah timeline aage kisakati nazar aa rahi he
 Let us know that 30-year-old Spiridonov, born in Russia, has shown a desire for this operation, who is suffering from a disease named verdunig-hofmann
 haalanki rain ne yah bataane se inkaar kar diya he ki mastishk daan karne vaala sharir kiskaa he or kis desh se taalluk rakhata he
 There is a huge demand for human organs in China but there is a shortage of donors, due to which the prisoners who have been sentenced to death for many years remain the source of this work
 haalanki china ne pran liya he ki vah maut kii sazaa paane vaale kaidiyon ke ang kaa istemaal nahin karegaa lekin jaankaron ko china kii is yojana par shaq he
 They say that the organs will still be taken only for the prisoners, but now they will be kept in the category of 'donation / donation'
 tippaniyan Significantly, China banned human organ trafficking in 2007, but in this country with a population of more than 100 crores, the demand for transplantation is going head-on, which has opened the doors of forced donations and illegal sales
 angadaan ke peeche kii vajah china ke logon kaa punarjanm main vishwaas he jahaan mana jaataa he ki dobaaraa duniya main aane ke liye sharir ko puraa hona zaruri he
 Ren and his fellow Italian surgeon Sergio Conveiro hope to try the procedure within two years, but this is possible only when initial research and tests are planned
 rain ne samachar agency ffp se kaha 'media ko lagata he ki ham yah surgery 2017 tak kar denge lekin yah tabhi mumkin he jab isse pehle uthaae jane vaala ek ek kadam plan ke anuroop rakhaa jaae
 ' turin advanced neuromodulation group kii aguwai karne vaale kanavero ne is project kii ghoshnaa 2013 main hi kar di thi or kaha tha ki yah prakriya jald se jald 2016 tak mumkin ho paaegi

 bataa den ki is oparation ke liye rus main janme 30 saal ke spiridonov ne ichha dikhaai he jo ki vardenig-holeman naam kii beemaari se peedit hai
 Ren, however, refuses to disclose whose donor body belongs to which country
 china main maanav ang kii baari maang he lekin ise daan karne waalon kii kaaphi kami he jis vajah se kaaphi saalon se maut kii sazaa paane vaale kaidi hi is kaam kaa strot bane hue hai
 Although China has vowed that it will not use the organs of the prisoners who have been sentenced to death, but experts doubt the Chinese plan
 unka kahana he ki ang to ab bhi kaidiyon ke hi liye jaaenge lekin ab inhen 'daan / donneton' kii shrenee main rakhaa jayega
 The comments gauratlab he ki china ne 2007 main maanav ang kii taskari par roak laga di thi lekin 100 karod se bhi zyada kii jansankhya vaale is desh main pratiropan kii maang sir chadhakar bol rahi he jisaki vajah se balpurvak daan or avaidh bikri ke darvaaze khul gaye hai
 The reason behind organ donation is the belief in the rebirth of the Chinese people, where it is believed that the body must be completed in order to come back to the world

 Filmed on Emraan Hashmi and Kriti Kharbanda, the song has been composed by Jeet Ganguly and written by Kausar Munir

 The song has been given voice by Arijit Singh
 bataa den ki film kaa trailor 16 agast ko relies hua tha
 The viewership of youtube on youtube is approaching 1
5 million
 is film ke riter or diarectoravikram bhattahai or mukesh bhatta or bhushan kumaar ne film ko produs kiya he
 The first thing that comes to mind as soon as the name of Bollywood actress Sadhana is Sadhana hair cut
 vahi sadhana hair cat jo unhen aarake nayyar ne diya tha
 She was also inspired by Hollywood actress Audrey Hepburn
 nayyar sahab karne kii yah koshish sadhana kii pahchaan ban gai or yuvaaon kii jaan
 The film was 'love in Shimla' (1960)
 shaayad yah baat mujhe us samay nahin pataa thi, jab maine pehali baar koi 10 saal kii umr mensadhanaki film 'rajkumaar' (1964) dekhi thi
 This hairstyle was too modern for the child of the 1980s and that era of Doordarshan
 vajah, laton kaa maathe par girnaa
 That face engulfed in memories
 doordarshan kaa daur tha or hafte main ek hi din film aati thi
 It was Sunday
 subah pataa chalaa ki rajendra kumaar kii film 'araju' (1965) aa rahi he
 The mood was off because there was a film a week
 bachche the to ection kaa intjaar rahata tha
 Rajendra Kumar used to be a weeping film for us
 shaam ko dost ke ghar film dekhne pahunche to vahi cheharaa dikhaa
 The same one bas, bal man use dekhne laga or uske jaadu main puri film dekh daali
 After that, the age also increased and the number of films made
 'meraa saaya' (1966), 'ek phool do mali' (1969) or 'aap aae bahaar ai' (1971) jaisi shandaar filmein dekhin
 Her acting was also convincing with her hairstyle and her magic eyes, which were even more deadly in the pain-filled scene of 'arju'
 'wo koun thi' (1964) main unki ankhen suspence ko gahraane main kahar dhane kaa kaam karti thim
 She topped the list of my favorite heroines of the old times and it seemed like this song of 'mera Saaya', 'tu Jahan Jahan Chale, Mera Saaya Saath Saath 
 
 ' mere liye likhaa gaya tha
 The childhood heroine's hairstyle became the first condition for choosing a girlfriend in her youth
 aksar doston ke saath baithkar baat hoti to pehla jumala yahi hota ki bandi kaa heirstilsadhanakat vaala hi hona chahie
 Time passed
 lekin jo baat aaj bhi mere saath he vah he sadhana, unka heirstil or unki ankhon kaa jaadu
 Today when the news of Sadhna's departure was received, the first lines of the song of his film 'rajkumar' echoed in the mind, 'you have seen someone's life going away / Look at me, i am dying

 jiesti ne apratyaksh kar lagane ke vitt mantri ke adhikaar ko kaaphi simit kar diya he
 In the budget, the government may increase or decrease the indirect tax on petroleum and alcohol only outside the purview of GST
 bijli bhi jiesti ke daayre se baahar he, lekin centre sarkaar is par tex nahin laga sakati
 In fact, GST has changed the way the budget is presented
 isse vitt mantri ke tex lagane ke adhikaar kaaphi simit ho gaye hai
 Earlier the Finance Minister could impose indirect tax, which affects the daily life of the people
 lekin is baar jab arun jetali, modi sarkaar kaa antim bajet pesh karenge to vah zyaadaatar vastuon par apratyaksh kar ke bare main koi ghoshnaa nahin kar paaenge, kyonki in sabko jiesti main samahit kar liya gaya he
 Almost all items which were earlier under excise, sales tax, service tax have now come under the purview of GST
 inke rate main badlaav ab sirf jiesti concil ke dwaara ho saktaa he
 However, there are still three sets of items which are outside the purview of GST
 alcoholgsti concil main is baat par amrai nahin ban pai thi ki alcohol ko jiesti ke daayre main laayaa jaae yaa nahin
 Therefore, the Finance Minister can make any announcement on its tax proposals in the 2018-19 budget to be presented on 1 February
 petroleumpetroleum padaarthon ko jiesti ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 Therefore, it is expected that there should be an announcement in the budget about petroleum products like crude oil, petrol, high-speed diesel, natural gas, ATF
 haalanki, petrol evam dijal kii pehle se hi oonchi keemton or agle saal aam chunaav ko dekhte hue eendhan par tex badhaane ke asaar kam hi hai, isliye vitt mantri duusare petroleum padaarthon par tex badha sakate hai
 Electric power is excluded from the area of the GST
 iske baavjood vitt mantri is par tex nahin laga sakate
 Electricity has been placed in the concurrent list of the constitution, but states have been empowered to tax it
 bijli aapurti par tex lagane kaa adhikaar rajya sarkaron ko he
 Thus, this time the Finance Minister has only two categories left for indirect taxation in the budget
 baaki sabhi vastuon par jiesti lagaaya jaataa he, jo utpaadan se lekar antim upbhog tak kai charnon main lagata he

 " Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Saturday that he would welcome Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi to the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government
 iske baad se rahul kaa vah bayaan pun: charchaaon main aa gaya jisamen unhone kaha tha ki vah badi bhoomika nibhaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 The Prime Minister told reporters after the swearing-in ceremony of Vice President Hamid Ansari at Rashtrapati Bhavan, 'I have always said that i (in the government) will welcome Rahul's entry
 'rahul ne kuch samay pehle yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki vah party evam sarkaar main badi bhoomika nibhaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Sources said that this fact will be clarified in September when the expansion of the Union Cabinet is possible
 yadhyapi pradhanmantri kaa bayaan pramukh vipakshi dal bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko bahut prabhaav nahin daal sakaa
 Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said, "whom they keep in government is their prerogative
" hamen isse koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 The Prime Minister had earlier welcomed Rahul to join the cabinet, but Rahul had stated his priority to die in the party
 sansad kaa monsoon satr shuru hone se pehle lagbhag 10 party saansadon ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko patr likhaa tha ki rahul ko loksabhaa main sadan kaa netaa banaaya jaae
 But the post went to Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, loyal to the Gandhi family, on the basis of seniority and administrative experience
 lekin rahul ke kareebi maane jane vaale congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne kaha he ki vah chahenge ki rahul party main koi badi bhoomika nibhaaen
 The debate over Rahul's larger role has started from the time when Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid said that he has played minor roles in the party till now, and now he should guide the directionless party before the 2014 general election
 iske pehle sonia gandhi ne kaha tha ki party main koi badi bhoomika nibhaane kaa nirnay rahul ko khud lenaa he

 jammu-kashmir main sarkaar banane ke liye pidipi ke saath haath milaane ko lekar congress pasopesh main he
 According to sources, PDP supremo and former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti have sent signals to senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad to form the government
 pidipi ke 28, congress ke 12 or 4 nirdaleey vidhayakon ko milakar jammu-kashmir vidhansabha main bahumat kaa aankada chuaa ja saktaa he
 44 mlas are required for a majority in the 87-member Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly
 manmohan singh ke ghar baithkado hafte pehlepidipior bijepi kaa naata tuutane ke baad se jammu-kashmir main governor rule lagu he
 The party's planning and policy group met at the house of senior Congress leader and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to look into the situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 is baithak main jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri gulam nabi aaazaad, rajya ke liye party prabharee ambika soni or purv kendriya grih mantri pi chidambaram bhi shaamil hue
 If sources are to be believed, the Congress convened this important meeting to discuss the situation after the Governor Rule in Jammu and Kashmir, but the important issue was the formation of a new government there
 sutron kaa kahana he ki rajya main pidipi ke saath sarkaar banane ke prastaav ko lekar congress uljhan main hai
 There are 5 major reasons for this confusion
 5 badi ulajhanein1
 The Congress does not want to upset its old ally National Conference in any way
 jaahir he congress ne agar pidipi ke saath haath milaane kaa faisla kiya to ye faruk abdulla-umr abdulla ko nagavar gujaregaa
 2
 congress hameshaa pidipi ko bijepi se haath milaane ke liye koste rahane ke saath kashmir main halaat kharaab karne ke liye jimmedaar tehraati rahi he
 In such a situation, the Congress is weighing every advantage and disadvantage of forming a government with the PDP as soon as it is separated from the BJP
 congress ko lagata he ki ghati main pidipi kii siyaasi haalat kharaab he or use bijepi se haath milaane kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa
 3
 congress ko yah bhi ashanka he ki bijepi (25 vidhayak) kahin neshnal conference (15 vidhayak) or nirdaliyon ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kii koshish naa kare
 However, the party also believes that the PDP and the National Conference in the Valley are traditionally anti-political
 congress sutron ke mutabik aaj ke halaat main neshnal conference kaa palada baari lagata he, aise main bahut kam sambhaavna he ki wo bijepi ke saath haath milaane ke liye taiyaar ho
 4
 jammu-kashmir ke rajyapal ke taur par enen vohara se congress ko koi khaas aapatti nahin, lekin unke badale jane kii surat main kisi nae rajyapal kii bhoomika sawaalon ke ghere main aa sakati he
 According to sources, thinking of this aspect, forming a government may be a better option
 5
 Most legislators, irrespective of any party, do not want mid-term elections in the state, they are also under pressure
 'dekho or intjaar karo' par congressutron kii maane, ye wo sawaal hai jinke chalate congress fouran koi faisla nahin karnaa chaahati
 She wants to follow the 'watch and wait' strategy, but right now the party does not want to show itself hurrying to form a government or is in a hurry
 isiilie siyaasi lihaaj se party kii rajya prabharee ambika soni ne pidipi ke saath sarkaar banane ke sawaal par baithak ke baad napa-tula bayaan dete hue kaha, 'ham jammu-kashmir main vidhansabha bhang karke jaldi chunaav chaahate hai
 'congress has called a meeting of about 100 party leaders in Srinagar on Tuesday to get an opinion on the grassroots level in Jammu and Kashmir
 is baithak main saansad, vidhayak, purv saansad or purv vidhayak samet tamaam netaa shaamil hai
 However, the Congress is following the 'tel Dekho and Tel Dhar Dekho' strategy for Jammu and Kashmir
 parde ke peeche beshak jo bhi chal rahaa ho, lekin party saamne se koi line lete philhal dikhnaa nahin chaahati
 Delhi BJP has launched a campaign against the Kejriwal government
 dilli bijepi adhyaksh ke netritv main rajghat par dilli dehaat se jude mudde ko lekar mahapanchayat bulaai gai thi
 In this, the Kejriwal government's failures were about the farmers, but the Mahapanchayat flopped
 rajghat par yojit is kaarykram main bahut hi kam log pahunche
 In this mahapanchayat, this mahapanchayat was called for taking unauthorized colonies along with village, countryside
 iskaa makasad tha inaki samasyaon ko lekar kejariwal sarkaar par hallaa bolnaa
 But the situation was such that only the people who spoke were absent
 yahaan tak kii bijepi ke flop sho se netao ne bhi kanni kaat lee
 Where BJP President Manoj Tiwari went to attend a meeting with Urban Development Minister Hardeep Puri, other big leaders did not come
 sirf dilli bijepi ke mahasachiv rajesh bhaatia or media sanyojak hi pahunche
 Even the program Kojaldi had to be stopped
 kisaanon ke saath-saath dilli dehaat ke logon ko bijepi ke saath jodne or kejariwal sarkaar kii naakaamiyon ko lekar bulaai baithak chaaron khaane chit ho gai
 In such a big question, with the help of such flop show, Delhi BJP will surround the Kejriwal government
 kaha to ye gaya ki inaki samasyaon ko lekar mahapanchayat bulaai gai lekin is mahapanchayat main jyadatar kursiyaan khaali hi thi or mushkil se 100 log hibijepi jamaa karpai thi

 centre ne gujarat ke ek gaanv main naregaa mazdooron ko bhugtan sambandhi ek karod rupaye ke kathith ghotaale main ‘tatkaal jaanch’ karne ke aadesh die hai
 Union Rural Development Minister CP Joshi has directed that the report should be investigated and submitted by November 30
 mantralay ne ek vaktavy main kaha, ‘kendriya gramin vikaas or panchayat raaj mantri si pi joshi ne gujarat ke kotiana jile ke kotda gaanv main naregaa ke bhugtan main kathith aniyamitata kii tatkaal jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 ' ravivaar ko ramlila maidan main chaaron taraf khichdi kii khushboo thi
 Actually it was not a common slang
 is khichdi ko pakaane ke liye 28,000 kaaryakarta teen maheene tak din raat jute rahe
 The President of BJP Scheduled Caste Morcha, Mohan Lal Giara, explains the political mathematics of this khichdi
 dekhie 2015 main dilli main anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit 12 siton main se ek bhi bhaajapa kii jholii main nahin giri thi
 Even in 2013, when the BJP had 32 seats, only two reserved seats were won by the BJP
 rajdhani main 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik 17 fisadi dalit hai
 By the way, this figure has now reached 22 percent
 lekin phir bhi kagaji aankade ko hi thik maane to bhi yah aabaadi kaa bada hissaa he
 Bringing khichdi from the home of three lakh people means that we reached 15 lakh people
 dilli kii kareeb sava karod kii aabaadi main daliton kii sankhya bhi lagbhag itani hi he to agar hamaari khichdi kii khushboo daliton ke dilon ko bha gai to sochie bhaajapa kii jholii dalit voton se bhar jaaegi
 They tell us that Dalits gave us at least a handful of khichdi in the house we went to
 khichdi dene or vot dene main fark hota he? kya isi sahdayata ke saath bhaajapa ko vot bhi milenge? giyara kehete hai, ‘‘ pehali baar ham daliton ke daravaaje tak pahunche hai
 From the response we got, it seems that we have reached their heart directly from the door
 ’’ve to yah bhi kehete hai, abhi iske bare main koi plan nahin kiya gaya he lekin agar sheersh netritv ne hamen ijaajat di to loksabhaa chunaav se pehle ham mandal str par is khichdi ko pakaaenge or abhi to keval kaaryakartaaon ke saath khichdi khai he lekin tab ham sidhe janata ke saath iskaa swaad chakhenge
 They say, during the program of gathering khichdi from door to door, the message was also conveyed that the BJP is the benefactor of the Dalits who decided to strictly abide by the SC and ST Act
 daliton ke ghar se ikatthe hue chawaal or daal kii khichdi agar koi dalit shef banaata to sandesh zyada saaf jaataa?jawaab main ve kehete hai, yah samarasata khichdi he ise kisi jati se jodakar mat dekhie
 But if we do this program at the Mandal level further , this suggestion can also be taken into consideration
 is khichdi ko pakaane ke liye nagpur se shef vishnu manohar apane saath 20 feet vyas, chah feet gaharaai vaali kadhai laae or chaar se paanch ghante kii mashkkat ke baad ise pakaaya
 Even before this, he has registered his name in the Guinness Book of World Records by making 3000 kg Khichdi in Nagpur
 lekin tab unka lakshya khichdi ko rashtriya bhojan ghoshit karne kii maang thi
 When Manohar Lal Giera was asked what is the meaning of calling a chef from Nagpur? If this khichdi Sangh is not cooking, then they laugh and say, "whatever means, but bjp's khichdi will be cooked at least in Delhi
 ’’ haalanki is khichdi kaa swaad daliton ko kitna bhaayaa iskaa pataa loksabhaa chunaav main lag hi jayega

 sopor ke mundji main harakat-ul-mujahidin samooh se jude purv aatankwaadi ejaj ahamed reshi kii somvaar ko hatya kar di gai

 For the 2015-16 fiscal year, there is little possibility of coming to the Rail Budget
 ek angreji akhbaar ke mutabik agle aam bajet main heerelbajet ko samahit kar diya ja saktaa he
 Not only this, it is also discussed that changes will be made in the structure of Kirlwayboard and IAS officers will get a place in it
 akhbaar ne bataaya ki sarkaar is baat par vichaar kar rahi he kirelbajet ko aam bajet se jod diya jaae or donon ek hi din tathaa ek saath pesh kiye jaaen
 For this, radical changes should be made in the structure of railway board
 ho saktaa he ki kisi iees afasar ko isaki jimmedaari saunpi jaae
 The government wants that decisions should be taken at this time and for this, there is talk of starting Indian Railways service
 isamen railway kii nau services ko milakar ek karne kii bhi baat he
 The government wants to redesign the railway budget and hence many proposals are coming out
 sarkaar yah bhi chaahati he ki yah rail prashasan ke kaam karne ke tareeke main badlaav aae or isliye isamen iees afasaron ko jagah dena chaahati he
 At present, many such proposals are with the government and these are being seriously considered
 rail punargathan samiti ke chairman vivek debaroy ne akhbaar ko bataaya ki railway kai dashakon se desh kii seva kar rahaa he
 But its way of working is still unscientific according to old and present circumstances
 isamen badlaav kii sakht jarurat he
 But this is not an easy task
 congress ke varisht netaa ashok gahalot ek baar phir rajasthan kii satta ke singhaasana par virajman hone ja rahe hai
 He has become the first choice of Congress President Rahul Gandhi in the cm's position, leaving behind Congress State President Sachin Pilot
 jabaki sachin payalat ko dipti siem banaaya gaya he
 Since the result of the assembly elections, there was a ruckus on the announcement of CM in the Congress
 payalat or gahalot se rahul gandhi ne alag-alag do dinon tak mulaakaat kii
 After this, Rahul approved the appointment of Gehlot as CM in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and handed over the responsibility of deputy CM to Sachin Pilot
 haalanki congress ke sanghathan mahasachiv banane ke baad is tarah ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki ab purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot rajya kii raajnneeti nahin karenge
 Therefore, it was believed that the way was ready for the state president Sachin Pilot to prepare his political ground
 ashok gahalot bhi kai baar is baat ko doharaa chuke the ki wo party main aise mukaam par pahunch gaye hai ki ab wo mukhyamantri banenge nahin balki banaaenge
 But he became the cm's first choice after the results
 rajasthan kii har sabha main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne janata ke saamne ye dikhaane kii koshish kii he ki rajasthan main party ekajute he or do alag-alag peedi ke netaaon main koi matbhed nahin he
 Sachin Pilot and Ashok Gehlot also joined the meeting by riding in a bus in the resolution rallies to give a message of solidarity
 vahiin, karauli kii ek jansabha main jate samay jab raste main kaaphi jam lag gaya tab payalat ne ek kaaryakarta kii motorcycle maangi or gahalot ko peeche baitaakar khud motorcycle chalaate hue raily sthal pahunch gaye
 Rahul Gandhi also told the forum, referring to this picture of both the leaders, that they are now convinced that there is no difference in the party
 congress kii reliyon main haath milaane, motorcycle par saath sawari karne ke baad is baat kii ghoshnaa swayan ashok gahalot ne party mukhyalay se kii ki ve or sachin payalat vidhansabha chunaav ladane ja rahe hai
 After which Sachin Pilot also said that on the instructions of party president Rahul Gandhi and on the request of Ashok Gehlot, he contested the assembly elections and won
 rajasthan main yah mana jaataa he ki sachin payalat par rahul gandhi kaa haath he, lekin isamen bhi koi shaq nahin ki vartmaan main rahul ke sabase majboot 'haath' ashok gahalot hai
 Currently, if anyone has been named as Ashok Gehlot at the top of the mass leader in the politics of Rajasthan
 raajnneetik rup se alpsankhyak or kamjor jati se aane vaale gahalot ne apane kaarykaal main rajasthan main aisa jaadu chalaaya jisaki kaat abhi kisi ke paas nahin he
 Gehlot's political prowess was that in 1998, he reached the pinnacle of power, leaving behind Parasram Maderna, a strong contender for the chief minister
 bhale hi rajasthan main mritpraaya padi party main jaan foonkane main payalat safal rahe hai
 He proved himself by returning the party to power
 lekin rajya kii pichhadi jatiyon main gahalot sarvamaanya netaa hai
 He was not in a mood to leave his ready political ground by breaking the equation of big and effective castes
 congress kaa sanghathan mahasachiv hone ke naate gahalot bhalee-bhaanti jaanate the ki ab wo puraani baat nahin rahi jisamen ve bina vidhansabha chunaav lade mukhyamantri ban gaye the
 There is also history behind it that when the state president CP Joshi was set to become the chief minister in the 2008 elections, he lost the assembly elections by one vote, Gehlot was made the chief minister because he was elected MLA
 loksabhaa chunaav main mili karaari shikast ke baad rahul gandhi ne rajyon main party kaa majboot sanghathan khadaa karne ke liye bade str par parivartan kiya
 After losing the Lok Sabha elections from Ajmer, when Sachin Pilot was made the President of Rajasthan Congress, then he faced Ashok Gehlot and CP Joshi within the party
 donon hi rahul gandhi ke bharosemand sipahasaalar or ranneetijna maane jate the
 At the same time, the image of the pilot was seen as a parachute-landed leader who had no ground hold
 in sab chizon ke baavjood sachin payalat ne rajya main arsh se farsh par padi party ko jeet ke muhane laakar khadaa hi nahin kiya, balki sarkaar kii satta main vaapasi karai
 There were many reasons behind this success of Pilot, the first reason was that he got a long time of five years to work as the State Congress President
 jisase unhen apana network khadaa karne or congress ke chehre ke taur par khud ko sthapit karne main aasaani hui
 The second pilot made extensive trips to the state as president and tried to make the party stand
 jab rajya main vidhansabha chunaav kii charchaa bhi nahin tab tak sachin payalat puure pradesh kaa lagbhag do baar daura kar chuke the
 Thirdly, his gentle, restrained personality led to his image as a progressive and modern leader, especially among the youth
 payalat ke mukaable gahalot kaa palada kyon he baari?in sabake baavjood rajasthan kii janata sachin payalat ko jis taraazoo main taulegi usamen pehle se hi ashok gahalot baithe hai, lihaaja taraazoo gahalot kii taraf hi jhukegaa
 The reason behind this is clear Pilot contested assembly elections for the first time
 ajmer se loksabhaa saansad rah chuke hai or unke pita dausa se saansad rah chuke hai
 a weakness of the pilot is that they are considered outsiders
 kyonki ve mulat: rajasthan ke nahin balki upi ke noida ke rahane vaale hai or 80 ke dashak main unke pita rajesh payalat ne dausa main apni raajnneetik jameen taiyaar kii
 While this was not the case with Ashok Gehlot, he has been active in the state for the last four decades
 sachin payalat ko mukhyamantri nahin banane ke pich alaakaman kii najar loksabhaa chunaav par he
 In such a situation, the party has a strategy to keep the state vigilant through an experienced leader and improve the results in the 2019 elections
 payalat gurjar samudaay se aate hai, jisaki ginati marshall kaum main hoti he
 The Congress does not want the Jat and Meena votes in the state to be angry with him
 yahaan bataanaa jaruri he ki gurjar or meena ek duusare ke paraspar virdohi maane jate hai
 As a result of this, Gehlot took the beating
 khabar ai he ki singhm-2 ko alag naam se shoot kiya ja rahaa he
 The sequel to the film was earlier named Singham-2 but now its name is being told as Singham Returns
 film ko rohit shetty diarect kar rahe hai or lead main ajay devgan hai
 The special thing of this film is the pairing of Kareena Kapoor Khan and Ajay Devgan
 donon kii jodi aakhri baar golmaal riterns main najar ai thi
 The chemistry of both has been favored in both serious and comedy films
 vaise bhi ajay-rohit kii jodi kaa hit filmein dene kaa record rahaa he
 Singham Returns is releasing in August

 Out of the eight thousand panchayats of the state, two thousand panchayats have written to the government for voting to remove liquor shops from their place
 rajasav kii kami ke dar sarkaar kisi bhi tarah se ise taalane main lagi he to janata court ke jariye voting ke niyam kaa paalan karvaa rahi he
 It is worth noting that before this, the sales of liquor in 15 districts of Rajasthan had reduced by ten to 28 per cent, due to which the angry government had given notice to the officers by snatching the vehicles
 teen saal tak ke sangharsh ke baad jab sarkaar sharaab kii dukaan hataane ke liye vot karwaane ke liye sarkaar raji nahi hui to inhone hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya or hoicourt ke aadesh par vot karwaae gaye jisamen 61 fisadi logon ne sharaab kii dukaan hataane ke liye vot diya or rojda panchayat sharaab mukt hui
 In fact, after five deaths due to drinking in the Panchayat, the people here had been agitating for 351 days for prohibition
 rojda panchayat kii dukaan to band ho gai, lekin rajya ke kareeb 50 panchayatein kai maheene se sharabbandi ke liye dharna-pradarshan kar rahi he
 Later, the people of Hanumangarh Panchayat have also handed over the signed application of twenty percent of the voters to the administrative authorities as per the rules to close the liquor shops of their panchayat, but despite pleading many times their demand was not heard and now The villagers have made up their mind to fight across

 Apart from this, 2000 panchayats have written to get verification for removal of liquor shop
 sarkaar kii samasya yah he ki shayaab bechakar kareeb aath hajaar karod rupee kaa rajasav aata he or rajya main deshi or videshi sharaab kii saat hajaar dukaane hai
 In fact, Rajasthan's Excise Act has the right to close a liquor shop with 51 percent vote, which was never used, but since the death of former MLA Gursharan Chhabra, while sitting on a dharna for the ban, two panchayats have Through this rule, liquor has been imprisoned
 udhar aabkaari vibhaag ke ayukta opi yadav kaa kahana he ki aapasi ranjish ke liye log shikayate karte hai or hamaare vibhaag kaa kaam he ki sharaab bechakar zyada se zyada rajasav kii prapti karen or iske liye ham lagaataar koshish karte rahete hai
