 big bos main kaaphi mjedaar rahe lagjri bajet task ke baad ab baari he ghar kaa aglaa captain chunane kii
 Two contenders are to be chosen for the new captain
 arshi khan or shilpa scindia ke bich captensi ko lekar jang ho rahi he
 In fact, Arshi is asked to choose Punish, the director for the Bigg Boss Captaincy Task, and any two people from the winning team of the luxury budget task
 in sabhi logon kii aapasi sahmati se arshi ko naam tay karne hai
 The current Captain Arshi has already made it clear that she will not make Punish a contender
 big bos ke ghar main peeth peeche punish-arshi ne kii chugali, jamkar royee hinaaaise main ab arshi ko vikaas, shilpa scindia, lav tyaagi or khud main se do logon kaa chayan karnaa he
 Love, Shilpa and Arshi want to become captains themselves
 lekin vikaas shilpa ko captain banvaanaa chaahate hai
 Now a new war has started in the house about this
 a post shared by @reality_informerondec 15, 2017 at 3:33am pstpicale kai hafton se captency main dilchaspee naa dikhaane vaali shilpa scindia is baar captain bananaa chaahati hai
 But Arshi is strongly against making him captain
 unhen lagata he ki shilpa ko immunity kii koi jarurat nahin he
 At the same time, Luv believes that he may be out of the house this week, so wants to become a captain once
 big bos main ajeebogareeb task: arshi pregnent, priyank ne pahani bikiniarshi or shilpa is bahes ko khatm karne ke liye vikaas ko captain banane ko kehete hai
 But development does not have to be captain
 shuukravaar ko oner hone vaale is episod kaa promo behad mjedaar he
 It will be interesting to see who will get the responsibility of the new captain
 pichley hafte ghar main aae celebrities ne shilpa ko kaha tha ki vah captensi ke liye lade
 Host Salman Khan also asked him to take Captaincy seriously
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki is baar shilpa capten banane ke liye adi hai
 The Modi government approved the National Health Policy on Wednesday
 is niti ke jariye desh main 'sabhi ko nishchit swasthya sevaayen' muhaiyaa karaane kaa prastaav he
 Government sources said that the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the health policy pending for the last two years
 kendriya mantri je pi nadda kal sansad main swat: ek bayaan dekar is niti ke ahm pahaluon kii jaankaree de sakate hai
 Sources in the Ministry of Health said that under a major policy change, this policy widens the pane of sectors falling within the purview of Primary Health Center (PHC) level and paves the way for a broader stance

 isse pehle kendriya cabinet kii pichhali baithak do baitaikon main rashtriya swasthya niti par faisla taal diya gaya tha
 Although the agenda of the Cabinet did not mention making health a fundamental right as it would have legal consequences, but it proposes confirmed health services
 isse pehle varsh 1983 or 2002 main bhi sarkaar swasthya niti lekar ai thi
 The government failed to achieve the targets set under those policies on the basis of five-year plans

 Earlier, the decision on the National Health Policy was deferred in the last two meetings of the Union Cabinet
 vaise mantrimandal ke agenda main swasthya ko moulik adhikaar banane kaa zikr nahin tha kyonki iske kanoonee nattejey honge lekin yah pakki swasthya sevaaon ko prastaavit karata he
 Earlier in the year 1983 and 2002 also the government came out with health policy

 Sabyasachi said that he cannot make any suggestion regarding the dress of the Prime Minister

 namaskara main raveesh kumaar, mujhe pataa he aap hansenge ki aaj uniwarsity series he ki nahin
 Actually there is only one thing left to laugh at India's higher education
 do chaar das kalege uniwarsity ko centre for exlence kaa naam dekar baaki sabko kabad main badalane ke liye chhod diya gaya he
 Our series revealed that our politicians are very stubborn
 kisi ne bhi ucch shiksha kii is karaab haalat par nahin bolaa
 This was what we expected, glad that they are not speaking
 ye bharosa unhen aapane diya he
 The condition of hundreds of colleges in India has been worse than ruins, neither you spoke nor teachers spoke nor students spoke
 to phir netaa kyon bolenge
 When their work is done with Hindu Muslim topics, then why would they come in front of you and promise to fix the colleges
 acha lagata he ki aapmen se kai darshak channelon or akhbaaron khaskar hindi akhbaaron ke is pattern ko samajhate hai
 Where accountability is less sought, speech is promoted more
 lekin kya aap media ke banaae is surang se nikal sakate hai
 i do not think so
 hameen hi nahin, aap bhi funs gaye hai
 Good and loud news will continue to come in two exceptions, but after that the tubelight will be extinguished in the tunnel
 media par netaa kaa hi niyantran rahegaa or vahi tay karegaa ki aaj kii raat aap kis vishay par charchaa karenge
 Sometimes we are ashamed to talk about the debates created by the leaders by talking about hospitals and colleges
 hamaare hisse haar hi likhi he
 We know this but the fun comes when you lose to lose
 ye haarana bhi aapke hi jaisaa hona he
 You too are a loser
 to kul milakar uniwarsity series puri tarah se fail rahi
 He liked those who thought that someone should show this problem on the media
 wo apni samasya ko tivi par dekhakar khush ho gaye
 Actually, we no longer want a solution, we want to see the problem we see daily on TV
 ise bataate hue na to meraa man udhaas he, na dil chota he
 Glad the time to get rid of it is coming to a close
 
 
 darasal netaa bol bhi denge to kya bolenge
 They will bring ratings, ranking and center for excellence and you will be given a dream to see one or two universities in a hundred universities of the world
 yah bhi ek pattern he
 The leader also knows that it cannot be resolved now
 isliye samaadhaan kaa koi image paidaa karo
 That image is ranking and rating
 sainkado kalege kabad kii tarah pade rahenge, ham or aap bees uniwarsity ko duniya kii sau uniwarsity main aa jane kii khabar sunakar so jaaenge
 In the fourteenth issue of the University Series, we will run Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh
 bharat ke grahamantri rajnath singh ke kalege kaa haal dekhenge
 KB Postgraduate College
 kanhaiya laal agarwal or basant laal agarwal ke naam par yah kalege bana he, ye do bhai the, kalege ke liye kaaphi zamin or sampatti de di
 The college's land is also in the city but it is found that they have been captured
 agarwal bandhu shahar ke bade vyapaaree the
 The two brothers together formed this college
 shahar ko bhi aap camere se dekh hi lijie
 It seems that no one in the city watches the English Channel, because of not seeing it, the nation is cut off from the ruckus
 is shahar kaa ghat bahut sundar he
 You see, this picture of Ghat
 kisi ne banaaya hi hoga jo aaj tak tamaam tarah ke upeksha vibhaagon kii mehnat ke baad bhi tikaa hua he
 The view of the Ghats is so beautiful
 aap jaanate hai ki grahamantri rajnath singh isi kaalaj ke chaatr rahe hai
 He completed his bsc studies
 emessi physics gorakhpur uniwarsity se kii
 He was appointed as an assistant professor here in 1971
 2000 tak rajnath singh is kalege se jude, tab upi ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad is kalege se istipha de diya
 Rajnath Singh is not a normal leader
 mukhyamantri ke baad bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh bane or is samay bharat ke grahamantri hai
 Everyone hopes that someone from the college who has become the Chief Minister and Home Minister will fix the condition of his college
 is paimaane se bharat ke kai netaa fail ho jaaenge
 When the BJP government was formed in UP for the first time in 1991-92, Rajnath Singh became the Minister of Education
 nakal rokane main kaaphi naam kamaaya tha
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh was a teacher in the Physics Department, where there is no permanent teacher
 yahaan par do anshkalik shikshak hai jinhen das hazaar rupee tak hi selary milti he
 Students pass with coaching
 ek shikshak ne bataaya ki jo garib hote hai ve koching nahin kar pate, nateeja yah hota he ki pratham varsh se dwitiya varsh tak aate aate chaatro ko bharat kii shiksha pranali kaa bodh ho jaataa he or ve iskaa paritya kar kahin or chale jate hai
 Which we drop out in English
 kaayade se inhen drops out nahin, thrown out kahana chahie matlab jinhen kalege ne admician liya magar kuch samay ke baad baahar phenk diya
 If you say thrown out, then the public will wake up, so we say drop out so that the public is told that you have left the college by yourself
 baharhaal physics department main bhale hi das baarah saal se koi permanent teacher nahin he magar grahamantri rajnath singh bhartiya raajnneeti ke permanent kirdaar hai
 Nobody could move even after wanting them
 yah bataanaa bhul gaya ki physics department main 350 chaatr padhate hai
 There is also no teacher in the Botany department
 ek anshkali padhaa rahe hai, purnakalik hone kii ummid main
 Through Ajay Singh we were able to reach this great college, Indresh Pandey did the rest
 kisi tarah kalege khulwakar prayogshaala kaa haal dekha to yakeen ho gaya ki bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran bechney waalon ko bharat ke guruon yaa prayogshaalaon kii koi phikr nahin he
 If you are understanding that this is a laboratory to research the properties of dust then you are not wrong
 is prayogshaala kaa naam durupyogshaala rakh dena chahie or vigyaapan banaakar tivi par dikhaanaa chahie ki ham iske bagair bhi yuvaaon ko bhaashan dekar unase vot le sakate hai
 The dust that has accumulated on the equipment here is actually saying that everything can be erased in the colleges of India, but the dust cannot disappear
 dhul aatma kii tarah amar he
 Surely the District Magistrate will issue a show cause notice to the principal after this show, but these dust mills know that they have not broken the discipline
 wo to chupchaap jami hui hai
 Discipline is broken by this prime time anchor who was wandering around the daily gimmick of politics with a camera in this lab
 aap is prayogshaala main kisi raat akele jaaiyegaa, mujhe yakeen he ki newton se lekar galileyon tak yahaan bidi banaate nazar aaenge
 Madame Curie and Edison will be heard laughing, and Jagdish Bose to Homi Bhabha will be reciting poems to the trees growing on the moon here
 hamen isaki jaankaree nahin mil sakati he ki bikar or test tub kaa tender niyamit rup se nikalataa he yaa nahin
 After showing the condition of the college of Balrampur, a student messaged, saying that you did not say that teachers or assistants take money to pass in the lab
 ve kaaphi kama lete hai
 We do not have such a large team to examine such things
 bharat kii ucch shiksha kaa haal cover karne ke liye do lakh samvaadadaata or bees hazaar samvaadadaataaon kii zarurat he jo hamaare paas nahin he
 College of India, jawans of India come to colleges and become junk
 vaise jis kalege main vigyaan dam tod rahaa he
 Biometric has come to attend teachers there
 anguuthe kaa nishaan lagaaiye, tuun taan bajaaiye or atendence ho gaya
 In this way, we enter new India through this machine, but after that you have to reach old India itself
 5000 chaatro ke liye yahaan 79 shikshakon ke pad manzur hai magar hai maatr 31
 Someone will count by looking at 31 teachers, but we are entering India in 2022, so a biometric machine is necessary
 is kalege main chaatr sangh ke chunaav chal rahe hai
 The candidate for president has stated that reforms will take place after he becomes president
 chunaav kii yahi khubi he, uske baad sab kuch badal jane kaa cinema dekhne ko miltaa he
 Which ends with the election
 praani vibhaag kii imaarat main lagata he praan hi nahin bache hai
 No creature will come here
 kalege kii imaarat biimaar he
 You see the condition of the building of KB PG College
 farsh tut chuki he
 See the condition of drinking water system
 aisa lagata he ki is kalege ke chaatro ko pyaas hi nahin lagati he
 They have stopped using the tap as early as the 21st century
 jab pani nahin pite hai to phir shauchalay kyon he
 Is it a miracle of science or a sacrament of our ruin
 ek shauchalay main taala laga hua tha, mahila principal ke cabin ke paas he isliye unhone band kar diya
 The principals are hopeful that everything will be alright
 ke bi kalege ke is shauchalay kaa haal dekh lijie
 What to expect is that Home Minister Rajnath Singh will change the condition of this college in his home district
 bahut se reporter gujarat chunaav ke sandarbh main ek hi netaa ko rose intervyuu le rahe hai unhen gujarat ke kalejon main janaa chahie
 In the college where the Prime Minister has studied
 taaki tulana kii ja sake ki apane apane kalejon kaa khyaal rakhane main, vikaas karne main grahamantri rajnath singh behatar hai yaa pradhanmantri modi
 Politics is also better than such healthy competition
 mirzapur kaa doosraa kalege he kamala aryakanya snatakottar mahavidlaay
 Completed in 1968
 meerajapur kaa ek maatr mahila kalege he
 The college building from outside looks just fine
 vibhinn vishyon main kareeb 1200 chaatro kaa yahaan bhavishya sanvar rahaa he
 Girls of Hindi class told that if no teacher has come for many days, then what to do, only gossip will do
 ek class main padhai chal rahi thi
 We saw the guidelines of the UGC
 vahi guideline jisamen vishwa stareey uniwarsity banane ke liye 20 kalejon se aavedan maanga gaya he
 It states that to become a world class, there should be 20 students per 1 teacher
 yah baat kisi khwab kii tarah lagi
 There is not a single teacher here and where there are one, there are not 20 but 1200 students
 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle or chunaavon ke baad pradhanmantri modi kaha karte the ki bharat shikshakon kaa niryaat karegaa
 Then i also felt that it was very good
 shikshakon ke niryaat kaa idia bhi nayaa he vaise kis desh main aaayaatit shikshakon kaa intazaar ho rahaa he pataa nahin
 There may be a country like this, but during the university series it has been understood that at this time India needs to import teachers
 shahar shahar ke kalege bina shikshakon ke suune pade hai
 Will talk about exports later
 pehle apane kalejon main shikshakon ke pad ko chaatro kii nai sankhya ke hisaab se moolyankan ho
 On 26 December 2014, the Prime Minister laid the foundation of the New Teacher Training Scheme at BHU and said that India should aim to export top class teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki duniya hamaari taraf dekh rahi he magar taiyaar nahin he
 Colleges of India will also be looking towards anyone, nobody is ready for them
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne pandit madan mohan malviya neshnal mishan aan teacher and training kii buniyaad rakhi thi
 It is the latest situation of this important scheme of 900 crores that the Director has been appointed
 biechayu ke paanch acre zamin de di he or yahaan bhawan banane ke tender kii prakriya shuru ho gai he
 Tender of the scheme which the Prime Minister has launched also takes three years to start
 philhal itani hi jaankaree mili he
 At that time the Prime Minister had said that there is a lot of demand for teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki bharat kii shiksha vyavastha robot banane ke liye nahin banaai gai he
 We produce a culture of tradition-based education
 shikshakon ke niryaat kii baat pradhanmantri ne medicin scavyar par bhi kii thi
 Speeches are available on pmindia's website
 28 sitambar 2014 ko kaha tha ki 2020 ke samay aate aate duniya main itani badi maatra main varccourse kii zarurat padane vaali he
 All the old people will be here
 duniya ke paas kaam karne vaale nahin honge
 We can supply the workforce to the whole world
 aaj vishwa main teachers kii maang he
 Maths and science teachers are not available
 kya bharat ye teachers export nahin kar saktaa
 He said the same thing on 17 November 2014 at Allphones Arena in Sydney
 sidney main kaha tha ki ag ham duniya main best quality ke teacher export karte hai puri duniya ko ham apana bana sakate hai
 Millions of schools and thousands of colleges in India need teachers in all subjects from Maths, Science, History, Hindi, Sanskrit
 noujvaan ujisi kii net pariksha paas kar naukariyon ke intazaar main buudhe ho rahe hai
 Every day, with a b
ed degree, they turn the pages of employment news
 niryaat karne kaa idia acha he magar wo itnaa acha laga ki khyaal hi nahin aayaa ki hamaare pados ke kalege ko bhi shikshakon ke aayaat kii zarurat he
 Amravati district is considered to be the education hub of Maharashtra as it has everything from engineering to medical
 privet bhi or sarkari bhi
 Our colleague Sanjay Shinde went to Wadhona Ramnath village in Amravati district
 amravati shahar se maatr 45 kimi dur he yah gaanv
 The village has a population of five thousand
 kisaan hi rahete hai
 Seeing this college running in three to four rooms, the Prime Minister can certainly be told that before the teacher's export, you should export such colleges from India
 yah kalege baarah saal se chal rahaa he
 Is private but accredited with Amravati University
 na to iske baad khel kaa maidan he, na hi prayogshaala he
 The children of nearby farmers take admission here to study in college
 yahaan par kai saal se kaam kar rahe shikshakon ko maatr 5000 rupee selary milti he
 Nutanam is working at less than the wages, less than the MNREGA rate
 sarkari rate he 240 rupee prati period
 According to this also teachers get less
 200 ke kareeb chaatr yahaan padhate hai
 Not a single teacher is permanent here

 kya bharat main ucch shiksha ke naam par samay kii barbaadi kaa kaarkaana band kar diya janaa chahie yaa shikshakon ke saath saath bharat ko kalege kaa bhi niryaat karnaa chahie
 If we wish, we can export these colleges lying idle
 jase ham shikshakon kaa niryaat karne vaale hai
 Let's take a break
 to phir netaa kyon bolenge
 When their work is done with Hindu Muslim topics, then why would they come in front of you and promise to fix the colleges
 acha lagata he ki aapmen se kai darshak channelon or akhbaaron khaskar hindi akhbaaron ke is pattern ko samajhate hai
 Where accountability is less sought, speech is promoted more
 lekin kya aap media ke banaae is surang se nikal sakate hai
 i do not think so
 hameen hi nahin, aap bhi funs gaye hai
 Good and loud news will continue to come in two exceptions, but after that the tubelight will be extinguished in the tunnel
 media par netaa kaa hi niyantran rahegaa or vahi tay karegaa ki aaj kii raat aap kis vishay par charchaa karenge
 Sometimes we are ashamed to talk about the debates created by the leaders by talking about hospitals and colleges
 hamaare hisse haar hi likhi he
 We know this but the fun comes when you lose to lose
 ye haarana bhi aapke hi jaisaa hona he
 You too are a loser
 to kul milakar uniwarsity series puri tarah se fail rahi
 He liked those who thought that someone should show this problem on the media
 wo apni samasya ko tivi par dekhakar khush ho gaye
 Actually, we no longer want a solution, we want to see the problem we see daily on TV
 ise bataate hue na to meraa man udhaas he, na dil chota he
 Glad the time to get rid of it is coming to a close
 
 
 darasal netaa bol bhi denge to kya bolenge
 They will bring ratings, ranking and center for excellence and you will be given a dream to see one or two universities in a hundred universities of the world
 yah bhi ek pattern he
 The leader also knows that it cannot be resolved now
 isliye samaadhaan kaa koi image paidaa karo
 That image is ranking and rating
 sainkado kalege kabad kii tarah pade rahenge, ham or aap bees uniwarsity ko duniya kii sau uniwarsity main aa jane kii khabar sunakar so jaaenge
 In the fourteenth issue of the University Series, we will run Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh
 bharat ke grahamantri rajnath singh ke kalege kaa haal dekhenge
 KB Postgraduate College
 kanhaiya laal agarwal or basant laal agarwal ke naam par yah kalege bana he, ye do bhai the, kalege ke liye kaaphi zamin or sampatti de di
 The college's land is also in the city but it is found that they have been captured
 agarwal bandhu shahar ke bade vyapaaree the
 The two brothers together formed this college
 shahar ko bhi aap camere se dekh hi lijie
 It seems that no one in the city watches the English Channel, because of not seeing it, the nation is cut off from the ruckus
 is shahar kaa ghat bahut sundar he
 You see, this picture of Ghat
 kisi ne banaaya hi hoga jo aaj tak tamaam tarah ke upeksha vibhaagon kii mehnat ke baad bhi tikaa hua he
 The view of the Ghats is so beautiful
 aap jaanate hai ki grahamantri rajnath singh isi kaalaj ke chaatr rahe hai
 He completed his bsc studies
 emessi physics gorakhpur uniwarsity se kii
 He was appointed as an assistant professor here in 1971
 2000 tak rajnath singh is kalege se jude, tab upi ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad is kalege se istipha de diya
 Rajnath Singh is not a normal leader
 mukhyamantri ke baad bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh bane or is samay bharat ke grahamantri hai
 Everyone hopes that someone from the college who has become the Chief Minister and Home Minister will fix the condition of his college
 is paimaane se bharat ke kai netaa fail ho jaaenge
 When the BJP government was formed in UP for the first time in 1991-92, Rajnath Singh became the Minister of Education
 nakal rokane main kaaphi naam kamaaya tha
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh was a teacher in the Physics Department, where there is no permanent teacher
 yahaan par do anshkalik shikshak hai jinhen das hazaar rupee tak hi selary milti he
 Students pass with coaching
 ek shikshak ne bataaya ki jo garib hote hai ve koching nahin kar pate, nateeja yah hota he ki pratham varsh se dwitiya varsh tak aate aate chaatro ko bharat kii shiksha pranali kaa bodh ho jaataa he or ve iskaa paritya kar kahin or chale jate hai
 Which we drop out in English
 kaayade se inhen drops out nahin, thrown out kahana chahie matlab jinhen kalege ne admician liya magar kuch samay ke baad baahar phenk diya
 If you say thrown out, then the public will wake up, so we say drop out so that the public is told that you have left the college by yourself
 baharhaal physics department main bhale hi das baarah saal se koi permanent teacher nahin he magar grahamantri rajnath singh bhartiya raajnneeti ke permanent kirdaar hai
 Nobody could move even after wanting them
 yah bataanaa bhul gaya ki physics department main 350 chaatr padhate hai
 There is also no teacher in the Botany department
 ek anshkali padhaa rahe hai, purnakalik hone kii ummid main
 Through Ajay Singh we were able to reach this great college, Indresh Pandey did the rest
 kisi tarah kalege khulwakar prayogshaala kaa haal dekha to yakeen ho gaya ki bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran bechney waalon ko bharat ke guruon yaa prayogshaalaon kii koi phikr nahin he
 If you are understanding that this is a laboratory to research the properties of dust then you are not wrong
 is prayogshaala kaa naam durupyogshaala rakh dena chahie or vigyaapan banaakar tivi par dikhaanaa chahie ki ham iske bagair bhi yuvaaon ko bhaashan dekar unase vot le sakate hai
 The dust that has accumulated on the equipment here is actually saying that everything can be erased in the colleges of India, but the dust cannot disappear
 dhul aatma kii tarah amar he
 Surely the District Magistrate will issue a show cause notice to the principal after this show, but these dust mills know that they have not broken the discipline
 wo to chupchaap jami hui hai
 Discipline is broken by this prime time anchor who was wandering around the daily gimmick of politics with a camera in this lab
 aap is prayogshaala main kisi raat akele jaaiyegaa, mujhe yakeen he ki newton se lekar galileyon tak yahaan bidi banaate nazar aaenge
 Madame Curie and Edison will be heard laughing, and Jagdish Bose to Homi Bhabha will be reciting poems to the trees growing on the moon here
 hamen isaki jaankaree nahin mil sakati he ki bikar or test tub kaa tender niyamit rup se nikalataa he yaa nahin
 After showing the condition of the college of Balrampur, a student messaged, saying that you did not say that teachers or assistants take money to pass in the lab
 ve kaaphi kama lete hai
 We do not have such a large team to examine such things
 bharat kii ucch shiksha kaa haal cover karne ke liye do lakh samvaadadaata or bees hazaar samvaadadaataaon kii zarurat he jo hamaare paas nahin he
 College of India, jawans of India come to colleges and become junk
 vaise jis kalege main vigyaan dam tod rahaa he
 Biometric has come to attend teachers there
 anguuthe kaa nishaan lagaaiye, tuun taan bajaaiye or atendence ho gaya
 In this way, we enter new India through this machine, but after that you have to reach old India itself
 5000 chaatro ke liye yahaan 79 shikshakon ke pad manzur hai magar hai maatr 31
 Someone will count by looking at 31 teachers, but we are entering India in 2022, so a biometric machine is necessary
 is kalege main chaatr sangh ke chunaav chal rahe hai
 The candidate for president has stated that reforms will take place after he becomes president
 chunaav kii yahi khubi he, uske baad sab kuch badal jane kaa cinema dekhne ko miltaa he
 Which ends with the election
 praani vibhaag kii imaarat main lagata he praan hi nahin bache hai
 No creature will come here
 kalege kii imaarat biimaar he
 You see the condition of the building of KB PG College
 farsh tut chuki he
 See the condition of drinking water system
 aisa lagata he ki is kalege ke chaatro ko pyaas hi nahin lagati he
 They have stopped using the tap as early as the 21st century
 jab pani nahin pite hai to phir shauchalay kyon he
 Is it a miracle of science or a sacrament of our ruin
 ek shauchalay main taala laga hua tha, mahila principal ke cabin ke paas he isliye unhone band kar diya
 The principals are hopeful that everything will be alright
 ke bi kalege ke is shauchalay kaa haal dekh lijie
 What to expect is that Home Minister Rajnath Singh will change the condition of this college in his home district
 bahut se reporter gujarat chunaav ke sandarbh main ek hi netaa ko rose intervyuu le rahe hai unhen gujarat ke kalejon main janaa chahie
 In the college where the Prime Minister has studied
 taaki tulana kii ja sake ki apane apane kalejon kaa khyaal rakhane main, vikaas karne main grahamantri rajnath singh behatar hai yaa pradhanmantri modi
 Politics is also better than such healthy competition
 mirzapur kaa doosraa kalege he kamala aryakanya snatakottar mahavidlaay
 Completed in 1968
 meerajapur kaa ek maatr mahila kalege he
 The college building from outside looks just fine
 vibhinn vishyon main kareeb 1200 chaatro kaa yahaan bhavishya sanvar rahaa he
 Girls of Hindi class told that if no teacher has come for many days, then what to do, only gossip will do
 ek class main padhai chal rahi thi
 We saw the guidelines of the UGC
 vahi guideline jisamen vishwa stareey uniwarsity banane ke liye 20 kalejon se aavedan maanga gaya he
 It states that to become a world class, there should be 20 students per 1 teacher
 yah baat kisi khwab kii tarah lagi
 There is not a single teacher here and where there are one, there are not 20 but 1200 students
 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle or chunaavon ke baad pradhanmantri modi kaha karte the ki bharat shikshakon kaa niryaat karegaa
 Then i also felt that it was very good
 shikshakon ke niryaat kaa idia bhi nayaa he vaise kis desh main aaayaatit shikshakon kaa intazaar ho rahaa he pataa nahin
 There may be a country like this, but during the university series it has been understood that at this time India needs to import teachers
 shahar shahar ke kalege bina shikshakon ke suune pade hai
 Will talk about exports later
 pehle apane kalejon main shikshakon ke pad ko chaatro kii nai sankhya ke hisaab se moolyankan ho
 On 26 December 2014, the Prime Minister laid the foundation of the New Teacher Training Scheme at BHU and said that India should aim to export top class teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki duniya hamaari taraf dekh rahi he magar taiyaar nahin he
 Colleges of India will also be looking towards anyone, nobody is ready for them
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne pandit madan mohan malviya neshnal mishan aan teacher and training kii buniyaad rakhi thi
 It is the latest situation of this important scheme of 900 crores that the Director has been appointed
 biechayu ke paanch acre zamin de di he or yahaan bhawan banane ke tender kii prakriya shuru ho gai he
 Tender of the scheme which the Prime Minister has launched also takes three years to start
 philhal itani hi jaankaree mili he
 At that time the Prime Minister had said that there is a lot of demand for teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki bharat kii shiksha vyavastha robot banane ke liye nahin banaai gai he
 We produce a culture of tradition-based education
 shikshakon ke niryaat kii baat pradhanmantri ne medicin scavyar par bhi kii thi
 Speeches are available on pmindia's website
 28 sitambar 2014 ko kaha tha ki 2020 ke samay aate aate duniya main itani badi maatra main varccourse kii zarurat padane vaali he
 All the old people will be here
 duniya ke paas kaam karne vaale nahin honge
 We can supply the workforce to the whole world
 aaj vishwa main teachers kii maang he
 Maths and science teachers are not available
 kya bharat ye teachers export nahin kar saktaa
 He said the same thing on 17 November 2014 at Allphones Arena in Sydney
 sidney main kaha tha ki ag ham duniya main best quality ke teacher export karte hai puri duniya ko ham apana bana sakate hai
 Millions of schools and thousands of colleges in India need teachers in all subjects from Maths, Science, History, Hindi, Sanskrit
 noujvaan ujisi kii net pariksha paas kar naukariyon ke intazaar main buudhe ho rahe hai
 Every day, with a b
ed degree, they turn the pages of employment news
 niryaat karne kaa idia acha he magar wo itnaa acha laga ki khyaal hi nahin aayaa ki hamaare pados ke kalege ko bhi shikshakon ke aayaat kii zarurat he
 Amravati district is considered to be the education hub of Maharashtra as it has everything from engineering to medical
 privet bhi or sarkari bhi
 Our colleague Sanjay Shinde went to Wadhona Ramnath village in Amravati district
 amravati shahar se maatr 45 kimi dur he yah gaanv
 The village has a population of five thousand
 kisaan hi rahete hai
 Seeing this college running in three to four rooms, the Prime Minister can certainly be told that before the teacher's export, you should export such colleges from India
 yah kalege baarah saal se chal rahaa he
 Is private but accredited with Amravati University
 na to iske baad khel kaa maidan he, na hi prayogshaala he
 The children of nearby farmers take admission here to study in college
 yahaan par kai saal se kaam kar rahe shikshakon ko maatr 5000 rupee selary milti he
 Nutanam is working at less than the wages, less than the MNREGA rate
 sarkari rate he 240 rupee prati period
 According to this also teachers get less
 200 ke kareeb chaatr yahaan padhate hai
 Not a single teacher is permanent here

 kya bharat main ucch shiksha ke naam par samay kii barbaadi kaa kaarkaana band kar diya janaa chahie yaa shikshakon ke saath saath bharat ko kalege kaa bhi niryaat karnaa chahie
 If we wish, we can export these colleges lying idle
 jase ham shikshakon kaa niryaat karne vaale hai
 Let's take a break
 kebi snatakottar kalege
 The college is named after Kanhaiya Lal Agarwal and Basant Lal Agarwal, who were two brothers, gave enough land and property for the college
 kalege kii zamin shahar main bhi he magar pataa chalaa ki un par kabza ho gaya he
 The Agrawal brothers were big traders of the city
 donon bhai ne milakar yah kalege banaaya tha
 You can also see the city with a camera
 lagata he ki is shahar main koi bhi angrezi channel nahin dekhtaa he, na dekhne kii vajah se nesan ko lekar ho rahe bavaal se cat gaya he
 The ghat of this city is very beautiful
 aap dekhie, ghat kii is tasviir ko
 Someone must have created that till today, despite all the hard work of neglect departments
 ghat kii kalakriti kitni darshneey he
 You know that Home Minister Rajnath Singh has been a student of this era
 biessi kii padhai yahi puri kii
 msc Physics from Gorakhpur University
 1971 main yahaan sahaayak professor ke taur par niyukt hue the
 Rajnath Singh joined this college till 2000, then resigned from this college after becoming the Chief Minister of UP
 rajnath singh saamaanya netaa nahin he
 He became the national president of the BJP after the Chief Minister and is currently the Home Minister of India
 sabko ummid rahati he ki koi jis kalege se nikal kar mukhyamantri, grahamantri bana he, apane kalege kaa haal to thik karegaa
 Many leaders of India will fail with this scale
 1991-92 main jab upi main pehali baar bhaajapa kii sarkaar bani thi tab rajnath singh shiksha mantri bane the
 He had earned a lot in stopping copying
 grahamantri rajnath singh jis physics vibhaag main shikshak the aaj vahaan koi bhi permanent teacher nahin he
 There are two part-time teachers who get salary up to ten thousand rupees
 chaatr koching ke sahare paas hote hai
 a teacher told that those who are poor are unable to do coaching, as a result, students coming from first year to second year become aware of the education system of India and they abandon it and go elsewhere
 jinhen ham angrezi main drops out karte hai
 Ideally they should not be called out, thrown out, meaning the college took admission but was thrown out after some time
 thrown out kahenge to janata jaag jaaegi isliye ham drop out bolte hai taaki janata ko yah bataaya jaae ki tumne khud se kalege ko choda he
 Although there is no Permanent Teacher in the Physics Department for 10-12 years, Home Minister Rajnath Singh is a permanent character of Indian politics
 unhen chaah kar bhi koi nahin hilaa sakaa
 Forgot to say that 350 students study in Physics Department
 botni vibhaag main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Teaching a part-time student, hoping to be full-time
 ajay singh ke zarie ham is mahaan kalege tak pahunch paae, baaki kaam indresh pandey ne kar diya
 After somehow opening the college and seeing the condition of the lab, it became clear that those who sold the churn to make India a world guru have no concern with the gurus or laboratories of India
 agar aap yah samaj rahe hai ki yah dhulakanon ke gunon par shodh karne vaali prayogshaala he to aap galat nahin he
 This laboratory should be named as Abushalaya and an advertisement should be made and shown on TV that without this we can give speech to the youth and take votes from them
 yahaan upkarnon par jo dhul jami he wo darasal yahi kah rahi he ki bharat ke kalejon main sab kuch mit sakati he, magar dhul nahin mit sakati he
 Dust is immortal like a soul
 zarur ziladhikari is sho ke baad principal ko kaaran bataao notice jari karegaa lekin in dhulakanon ko pataa he ki anushaasan unhone nahin todaa he
 She is frozen in silence
 anushaasan prime time ke is ankar ne todaa he jo raajnneeti kii rozaana nautanki ke bich is prayogshaala main camera lekar bhatak rahaa tha
 You will go to this lab alone one night, i am sure that you will be seen making beedis here from Newton to the Galleys
 madam curi or edison kii hansi sunai degi or jagadish bose lekar homi bhabha tak yahaan chand par ug aane vaale ped paudhon ko kavita suna rahe honge
 We cannot get information about whether the tender of beaker and test tube comes out regularly
 balrampur ke kalege kaa haal dikhaane ke baad ek chaatr ne messej kiya, kaha ki aapane yah to bataaya nahin ki prayogshaala main paas karaane ke liye shikshak yaa sahaayak paise lete hai
 They earn a lot
 hamaare paas aisi baton kii jaanch karne ke liye utani badi team nahin he
 To cover the state of India's higher education, two lakh correspondents and twenty thousand correspondents are needed, which we do not have
 bharat ke kalege bharat kii javaaniyon kalejon main aakar kabad ban jaati hai
 By the way, the science in which science is dying
 vahaan shikshakon ke atendence ke liye biometric aa gaya he
 Put a thumb impression, ring it and attend
 is tarah ham is mashin ke zarie nae bharat main pravesh kar jate hai lekin uske baad aapako puraane bharat main hi pahunchnaa hota he
 79 teachers posts are approved for 5000 students but only 31 are there
 31 shikshakon ko dekhakar hi koi gin degaa lekin ham 2022 ke bharat main enter kar rahe hai isliye biometric mashin zaruri he
 Students' union elections are going on in this college
 adhyaksh ke ummidavaar ne bataaya he ki unke adhyaksh banane ke baad sudhaar kiya jayega
 This is the quality of the election, after that everything gets to see the cinema
 jo chunaav ke saath khatm ho jaataa he
 It seems that there is no life left in the zoological department building
 yahaan koi praani nahin aata hoga
 The college building is sick
 aap kebi piji kalege kii imaarat kaa haal dekhte chaliye
 The floor is broken
 peya jal kii vyavastha kaa haal dekhie
 It seems that the students of this college do not feel thirsty
 unhone nal kaa istamaal karnaa 21veen sadi ke shuru hote hi band kar diya he
 When there is no drinking water then why is there a toilet
 kya yah vigyaan kaa koi chamatkaar he yaa phir hamaari barbaadi kaa sanskaar
 There was a lock in a toilet, the woman is near the principal's cabin so they locked it
 prisimple ashavan hai ki sab kuch thik ho jayega
 Check the condition of this toilet of KB College
 kya ummid kii jaae ki grahamantri rajnath singh apane grih zile ke is kalege kaa haal badal denge
 Many reporters are interviewing the same leader daily in the context of Gujarat elections, they should go to colleges in Gujarat
 us kalege main jahaan pradhanmantri padhe hai
 So that a comparison can be made whether Home Minister Rajnath Singh is better at taking care of his colleges or for development or Prime Minister Modi
 is tarah ke swasthy mukaable se raajnneeti bhi behatar hoti he
 The second college in Mirzapur is Kamala Aryakanya Postgraduate Mahavidlaya
 1968 main banakar taiyaar hua
 It is the only women's college in Mirajapur
 baahar se kalege kii imaarat thik thaak hi dikhti he
 About 1200 students in various disciplines have a future here
 hindi kii class kii ladakiyon ne bataaya ki kai dinon se koi padhaane vaala nahin aayaa he to kya karen, gapp shapp hi karenge
 Studies were going on in a class
 hamane ujisi kii guideline dekhi
 The same guideline in which applications have been sought from 20 colleges to become world class universities
 usamen kaha he ki world class banane ke liye 1 shikshak par 20 chaatr hone chahie
 This thing sounded like a dream
 yahaan to ek bhi teacher nahin hai or jahaan ek hai un par 20 nahin,1200 tak chaatr hai
 Before the Lok Sabha elections and after the elections, Prime Minister Modi used to say that India will export teachers
 tab sunakar mujhe bhi laga ki yah bahut acha
 The idea of export of teachers is also new, although in which country imported teachers are waiting
 ho saktaa he aisa koi desh ho magar uniwarsity series ke dauraan yah baat samaj main aa gai he ki bharat ko is vakt shikshakon ke aayaat kii zarurat he
 Colleges in the city are deserted without teachers
 niryaat kii baat baad main karenge
 First, the position of teachers in their colleges should be evaluated according to the new number of students
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne biechayu main new teacher training skim kii buniyaad rakhte hue kaha tha ki bharat ko taap class shikshakon ke niryaat kaa lakshya rakhana chahie
 He said that the world is looking at us but is not ready
 bharat ke kalege bhi kisi kii taraf dekh rahe honge, unke liye bhi koi taiyaar nahin he
 On 26 December 2014, the Prime Minister laid the foundation of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission on Teacher and Training
 900 karod kii yah mahatvakanjhi yojana kaa taaja haal he ki nideshak kii niyukti ho gai he
 BHU has given five acres of land and the tendering process for the building has started here
 pradhanmantri ne jis yojana kaa shubharambh kiya ho uskaa tender bhi shuru hone main teen saal lag jaataa he
 At the moment, the same information has been received
 us vakt pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki shikshakon kii bahut maang hai
 He had said that India's education system is not designed to make robots
 ham parampara aadhaarit shiksha kii samskruti kaa utpaadan karte hai
 The Prime Minister also talked about the export of teachers on the Madison Square
 piemindia kii website par bhaashan maujuud hai
 On September 28, 2014, it was said that by the time of 2020, such a large amount of workcourse will be needed in the world
 inke yahaan sab buudhe buudhe log honge
 The world will not have workmen
 ham puri duniya ko workforce supplai kar sakate hai
 Today there is a demand for teachers in the world
 Maths or Science ke teachers nahin milte hai
 Can India not export these teachers? yahi baat unhone 17 november 2014 ko sidney ke alphons arina main kahi thi
 We had said in Sydney that we export the best quality teacher in the world, we can make the whole world our own
 bharat ke lakhon skulon or hazaron kalejon ko maths, science, history, hindi, sanskrit se lekar tamaam vishyon ke shikshakon kii zarurat he
 Youngsters are getting old waiting for jobs by passing the UGC NET exam
 bied kii degree lekar rose rojgaar samachar ke panne palatate hai
 The idea of exporting is good but it was so good that it did not even realize that the colleges in our neighborhood also need to import teachers
 amravati zila maharashtra kaa ajukeshan hub mana jaataa he kyonki yahaan par ejineering se lekar medical sab hai
 Private as well as government
 hamaare sahyogi sanjay shinde amravati zile ke vadhona ramnath gaanv gaye
 This village is just 45 km from Amravati city
 gaanv kii aabaadi paanch hazaar kii he
 Only the farmers live
 teen chaar kamare main chal rahe is kalege ko dekhakar yakeenan pradhanmantri se kaha ja saktaa he ki teacher ke niryaat se pehle aap is tarah ke kalejon kaa bharat se niryaat kar den
 This college has been running for twelve years
 privet he lekin amravati uniwarsity se manyata praapt he
 There is neither a playground after this, nor a laboratory
 aas paas ke kisaano ke bachche yahaan admician lekar kalege main padhane kaa bharam paalate hai
 Teachers working here for many years get a salary of only 5000 rupees
 neutnam mazaduri se kam, manaregaa ke rate se bhi kam par kaam kar rahe hai
 The official rate is 240 rupees per period
 is hisaab se bhi shikshakon ko kam miltaa he
 Nearly 200 students study here
 yahaan par ek bhi shikshak permanent nahin he
 Colleges in India are warehouses to enslave teachers
 chaatro ko barbaad karne kaa kaarkaana
 Just ten km from the village where the college is located, is the village of Punjab Rao Deshmukh, India's first agriculture minister
 shikshak kehete hai ki paanch hazaar rupee main ham kaise jivan chalaayenge
 Several posts of teachers have been vacant in Amravati Sant Gadge Baba University
 yahaan kii imaarat to acchhee he magar kai vibhaagon main lekturer ke pad khaali hai
 Is a Professor Permanente in Hindi Department
 hindi kii jagah marathi ke professor kii niyukti ho gai he
 Sociology department has only 2 professors
 kai department aise hai jo ek ek professor ke bharose chal rahe hai
 The comments professor ke 17 pad mazur hai magar 11 khaali hai
 Assistant Professor has 29 posts, but 11 are vacant
 lekturer ke 65 pad manzur hai magar 11 khaali hai
 The university has sent a proposal to the government that more than 130 teachers are needed, uniwarsity series kaa yah chaudaavaan ank aapako kaisaa laga, ye hamen nahin, apane padosi ko bataaiye, aapas main charchaa kiijie ki karnaa kya he
 Should the factory of waste of time be closed in the name of higher education in India or should the colleges be exported to India along with teachers
 ham chaah len to bekaar pade in kalejon kaa niryaat kar sakate hai
 As we are about to export teachers
 brake le lete hai
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh was a teacher in the Physics Department, where there is no permanent teacher
 yahaan par do anshkalik shikshak hai jinhen das hazaar rupee tak hi selary milti he
 Students pass with coaching
 ek shikshak ne bataaya ki jo garib hote hai ve koching nahin kar pate, nateeja yah hota he ki pratham varsh se dwitiya varsh tak aate aate chaatro ko bharat kii shiksha pranali kaa bodh ho jaataa he or ve iskaa paritya kar kahin or chale jate hai
 Which we drop out in English
 kaayade se inhen drops out nahin, thrown out kahana chahie matlab jinhen kalege ne admician liya magar kuch samay ke baad baahar phenk diya
 If you say thrown out, then the public will wake up, so we say drop out so that the public is told that you have left the college by yourself
 baharhaal physics department main bhale hi das baarah saal se koi permanent teacher nahin he magar grahamantri rajnath singh bhartiya raajnneeti ke permanent kirdaar hai
 Nobody could move even after wanting them
 yah bataanaa bhul gaya ki physics department main 350 chaatr padhate hai
 There is also no teacher in the Botany department
 ek anshkali padhaa rahe hai, purnakalik hone kii ummid main
 Through Ajay Singh we were able to reach this great college, Indresh Pandey did the rest
 kisi tarah kalege khulwakar prayogshaala kaa haal dekha to yakeen ho gaya ki bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran bechney waalon ko bharat ke guruon yaa prayogshaalaon kii koi phikr nahin he
 If you are understanding that this is a laboratory to research the properties of dust then you are not wrong
 is prayogshaala kaa naam durupyogshaala rakh dena chahie or vigyaapan banaakar tivi par dikhaanaa chahie ki ham iske bagair bhi yuvaaon ko bhaashan dekar unase vot le sakate hai
 The dust that has accumulated on the equipment here is actually saying that everything can be erased in the colleges of India, but the dust cannot disappear
 dhul aatma kii tarah amar he
 Surely the District Magistrate will issue a show cause notice to the principal after this show, but these dust mills know that they have not broken the discipline
 wo to chupchaap jami hui hai
 Discipline is broken by this prime time anchor who was wandering around the daily gimmick of politics with a camera in this lab
 aap is prayogshaala main kisi raat akele jaaiyegaa, mujhe yakeen he ki newton se lekar galileyon tak yahaan bidi banaate nazar aaenge
 Madame Curie and Edison will be heard laughing, and Jagdish Bose to Homi Bhabha will be reciting poems to the trees growing on the moon here
 hamen isaki jaankaree nahin mil sakati he ki bikar or test tub kaa tender niyamit rup se nikalataa he yaa nahin
 After showing the condition of the college of Balrampur, a student messaged, saying that you did not say that teachers or assistants take money to pass in the lab
 ve kaaphi kama lete hai
 We do not have such a large team to examine such things
 bharat kii ucch shiksha kaa haal cover karne ke liye do lakh samvaadadaata or bees hazaar samvaadadaataaon kii zarurat he jo hamaare paas nahin he
 College of India, jawans of India come to colleges and become junk
 vaise jis kalege main vigyaan dam tod rahaa he
 Biometric has come to attend teachers there
 anguuthe kaa nishaan lagaaiye, tuun taan bajaaiye or atendence ho gaya
 In this way, we enter new India through this machine, but after that you have to reach old India itself
 5000 chaatro ke liye yahaan 79 shikshakon ke pad manzur hai magar hai maatr 31
 Someone will count by looking at 31 teachers, but we are entering India in 2022, so a biometric machine is necessary
 is kalege main chaatr sangh ke chunaav chal rahe hai
 The candidate for president has stated that reforms will take place after he becomes president
 chunaav kii yahi khubi he, uske baad sab kuch badal jane kaa cinema dekhne ko miltaa he
 Which ends with the election
 praani vibhaag kii imaarat main lagata he praan hi nahin bache hai
 No creature will come here
 kalege kii imaarat biimaar he
 You see the condition of the building of KB PG College
 farsh tut chuki he
 See the condition of drinking water system
 aisa lagata he ki is kalege ke chaatro ko pyaas hi nahin lagati he
 They have stopped using the tap as early as the 21st century
 jab pani nahin pite hai to phir shauchalay kyon he
 Is it a miracle of science or a sacrament of our ruin
 ek shauchalay main taala laga hua tha, mahila principal ke cabin ke paas he isliye unhone band kar diya
 The principals are hopeful that everything will be alright
 ke bi kalege ke is shauchalay kaa haal dekh lijie
 What to expect is that Home Minister Rajnath Singh will change the condition of this college in his home district
 bahut se reporter gujarat chunaav ke sandarbh main ek hi netaa ko rose intervyuu le rahe hai unhen gujarat ke kalejon main janaa chahie
 In the college where the Prime Minister has studied
 taaki tulana kii ja sake ki apane apane kalejon kaa khyaal rakhane main, vikaas karne main grahamantri rajnath singh behatar hai yaa pradhanmantri modi
 Politics is also better than such healthy competition
 mirzapur kaa doosraa kalege he kamala aryakanya snatakottar mahavidlaay
 Completed in 1968
 meerajapur kaa ek maatr mahila kalege he
 The college building from outside looks just fine
 vibhinn vishyon main kareeb 1200 chaatro kaa yahaan bhavishya sanvar rahaa he
 Girls of Hindi class told that if no teacher has come for many days, then what to do, only gossip will do
 ek class main padhai chal rahi thi
 We saw the guidelines of the UGC
 vahi guideline jisamen vishwa stareey uniwarsity banane ke liye 20 kalejon se aavedan maanga gaya he
 It states that to become a world class, there should be 20 students per 1 teacher
 yah baat kisi khwab kii tarah lagi
 There is not a single teacher here and where there are one, there are not 20 but 1200 students
 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle or chunaavon ke baad pradhanmantri modi kaha karte the ki bharat shikshakon kaa niryaat karegaa
 Then i also felt that it was very good
 shikshakon ke niryaat kaa idia bhi nayaa he vaise kis desh main aaayaatit shikshakon kaa intazaar ho rahaa he pataa nahin
 There may be a country like this, but during the university series it has been understood that at this time India needs to import teachers
 shahar shahar ke kalege bina shikshakon ke suune pade hai
 Will talk about exports later
 pehle apane kalejon main shikshakon ke pad ko chaatro kii nai sankhya ke hisaab se moolyankan ho
 On 26 December 2014, the Prime Minister laid the foundation of the New Teacher Training Scheme at BHU and said that India should aim to export top class teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki duniya hamaari taraf dekh rahi he magar taiyaar nahin he
 Colleges of India will also be looking towards anyone, nobody is ready for them
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne pandit madan mohan malviya neshnal mishan aan teacher and training kii buniyaad rakhi thi
 It is the latest situation of this important scheme of 900 crores that the Director has been appointed
 biechayu ke paanch acre zamin de di he or yahaan bhawan banane ke tender kii prakriya shuru ho gai he
 Tender of the scheme which the Prime Minister has launched also takes three years to start
 philhal itani hi jaankaree mili he
 At that time the Prime Minister had said that there is a lot of demand for teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki bharat kii shiksha vyavastha robot banane ke liye nahin banaai gai he
 We produce a culture of tradition-based education
 shikshakon ke niryaat kii baat pradhanmantri ne medicin scavyar par bhi kii thi
 Speeches are available on pmindia's website
 28 sitambar 2014 ko kaha tha ki 2020 ke samay aate aate duniya main itani badi maatra main varccourse kii zarurat padane vaali he
 All the old people will be here
 duniya ke paas kaam karne vaale nahin honge
 We can supply the workforce to the whole world
 aaj vishwa main teachers kii maang he
 Maths and science teachers are not available
 kya bharat ye teachers export nahin kar saktaa
 He said the same thing on 17 November 2014 at Allphones Arena in Sydney
 sidney main kaha tha ki ag ham duniya main best quality ke teacher export karte hai puri duniya ko ham apana bana sakate hai
 Millions of schools and thousands of colleges in India need teachers in all subjects from Maths, Science, History, Hindi, Sanskrit
 noujvaan ujisi kii net pariksha paas kar naukariyon ke intazaar main buudhe ho rahe hai
 Every day, with a b
ed degree, they turn the pages of employment news
 niryaat karne kaa idia acha he magar wo itnaa acha laga ki khyaal hi nahin aayaa ki hamaare pados ke kalege ko bhi shikshakon ke aayaat kii zarurat he
 Amravati district is considered to be the education hub of Maharashtra as it has everything from engineering to medical
 privet bhi or sarkari bhi
 Our colleague Sanjay Shinde went to Wadhona Ramnath village in Amravati district
 amravati shahar se maatr 45 kimi dur he yah gaanv
 The village has a population of five thousand
 kisaan hi rahete hai
 Seeing this college running in three to four rooms, the Prime Minister can certainly be told that before the teacher's export, you should export such colleges from India
 yah kalege baarah saal se chal rahaa he
 Is private but accredited with Amravati University
 na to iske baad khel kaa maidan he, na hi prayogshaala he
 The children of nearby farmers take admission here to study in college
 yahaan par kai saal se kaam kar rahe shikshakon ko maatr 5000 rupee selary milti he
 Nutanam is working at less than the wages, less than the MNREGA rate
 sarkari rate he 240 rupee prati period
 According to this also teachers get less
 200 ke kareeb chaatr yahaan padhate hai
 Not a single teacher is permanent here
 bharat ke kalege shikshakon ko gulam banane ke godaam hai
 Students ruining factory
 jis gaanv main yah kalege he vahaan se maatr das kimi kii duuri par bharat ke pehle krishi mantri punjab raav deshmukh kaa gaanv he
 The teacher says how will we run a life for five thousand rupees
 amravati sant gadge baba vishvavidhyalay main shikshakon ke kai pad khaali hai
 The building here is good but lecturer posts are vacant in many departments
 hindi vibhaag main ek professor permanent hai
 Marathi professor has been appointed in place of Hindi
 samajashaastra vibhaag main keval 2 hi professor hai
 There are many departments that are running on the trust of each professor
 tippaniyan There are 17 posts of professor but 11 are vacant
 assitant professor ke 29 pad hai, magar 11 khaali hai
 The lecturer has 65 posts, but 11 are vacant
 uniwarsity ne sarkaar ke paas prastaav bheja he ki 130 se zyaada shikshakon kii zarurat he, How did you like this fourteenth issue of the university series, not us, tell your neighbor, discuss among yourself what to do
 kya bharat main ucch shiksha ke naam par samay kii barbaadi kaa kaarkaana band kar diya janaa chahie yaa shikshakon ke saath saath bharat ko kalege kaa bhi niryaat karnaa chahie
 If we wish, we can export these colleges lying idle
 jase ham shikshakon kaa niryaat karne vaale hai
 Let's take a break
 agar aap yah samaj rahe hai ki yah dhulakanon ke gunon par shodh karne vaali prayogshaala he to aap galat nahin he
 This laboratory should be named as Abushalaya and an advertisement should be made and shown on TV that without this we can give speech to the youth and take votes from them
 yahaan upkarnon par jo dhul jami he wo darasal yahi kah rahi he ki bharat ke kalejon main sab kuch mit sakati he, magar dhul nahin mit sakati he
 Dust is immortal like a soul
 zarur ziladhikari is sho ke baad principal ko kaaran bataao notice jari karegaa lekin in dhulakanon ko pataa he ki anushaasan unhone nahin todaa he
 She is frozen in silence
 anushaasan prime time ke is ankar ne todaa he jo raajnneeti kii rozaana nautanki ke bich is prayogshaala main camera lekar bhatak rahaa tha
 You will go to this lab alone one night, i am sure that you will be seen making beedis here from Newton to the Galleys
 madam curi or edison kii hansi sunai degi or jagadish bose lekar homi bhabha tak yahaan chand par ug aane vaale ped paudhon ko kavita suna rahe honge
 We cannot get information about whether the tender of beaker and test tube comes out regularly
 balrampur ke kalege kaa haal dikhaane ke baad ek chaatr ne messej kiya, kaha ki aapane yah to bataaya nahin ki prayogshaala main paas karaane ke liye shikshak yaa sahaayak paise lete hai
 They earn a lot
 hamaare paas aisi baton kii jaanch karne ke liye utani badi team nahin he
 To cover the state of India's higher education, two lakh correspondents and twenty thousand correspondents are needed, which we do not have
 bharat ke kalege bharat kii javaaniyon kalejon main aakar kabad ban jaati hai
 By the way, the science in which science is dying
 vahaan shikshakon ke atendence ke liye biometric aa gaya he
 Put a thumb impression, ring it and attend
 is tarah ham is mashin ke zarie nae bharat main pravesh kar jate hai lekin uske baad aapako puraane bharat main hi pahunchnaa hota he
 79 teachers posts are approved for 5000 students but only 31 are there
 31 shikshakon ko dekhakar hi koi gin degaa lekin ham 2022 ke bharat main enter kar rahe hai isliye biometric mashin zaruri he
 Students' union elections are going on in this college
 adhyaksh ke ummidavaar ne bataaya he ki unke adhyaksh banane ke baad sudhaar kiya jayega
 This is the quality of the election, after that everything gets to see the cinema
 jo chunaav ke saath khatm ho jaataa he
 It seems that there is no life left in the zoological department building
 yahaan koi praani nahin aata hoga
 The college building is sick
 aap kebi piji kalege kii imaarat kaa haal dekhte chaliye
 The floor is broken
 peya jal kii vyavastha kaa haal dekhie
 It seems that the students of this college do not feel thirsty
 unhone nal kaa istamaal karnaa 21veen sadi ke shuru hote hi band kar diya he
 When there is no drinking water then why is there a toilet
 kya yah vigyaan kaa koi chamatkaar he yaa phir hamaari barbaadi kaa sanskaar
 There was a lock in a toilet, the woman is near the principal's cabin so they locked it
 prisimple ashavan hai ki sab kuch thik ho jayega
 Check the condition of this toilet of KB College
 kya ummid kii jaae ki grahamantri rajnath singh apane grih zile ke is kalege kaa haal badal denge
 Many reporters are interviewing the same leader daily in the context of Gujarat elections, they should go to colleges in Gujarat
 us kalege main jahaan pradhanmantri padhe hai
 So that a comparison can be made whether Home Minister Rajnath Singh is better at taking care of his colleges or for development or Prime Minister Modi
 is tarah ke swasthy mukaable se raajnneeti bhi behatar hoti he
 The second college in Mirzapur is Kamala Aryakanya Postgraduate Mahavidlaya
 1968 main banakar taiyaar hua
 It is the only women's college in Mirajapur
 baahar se kalege kii imaarat thik thaak hi dikhti he
 About 1200 students in various disciplines have a future here

 Colleges in the city are deserted without teachers

 The world will not have workmen

 Today there is a demand for teachers in the world
 Maths or Science ke teachers nahin milte hai
 Can India not export these teachers? yahi baat unhone 17 november 2014 ko sidney ke alphons arina main kahi thi
 We had said in Sydney that we export the best quality teacher in the world, we can make the whole world our own
 bharat ke lakhon skulon or hazaron kalejon ko maths, science, history, hindi, sanskrit se lekar tamaam vishyon ke shikshakon kii zarurat he
 Youngsters are getting old waiting for jobs by passing the UGC NET exam

 The idea of exporting is good but it was so good that it did not even realize that the colleges in our neighborhood also need to import teachers

 Teachers working here for many years get a salary of only 5000 rupees
 neutnam mazaduri se kam, manaregaa ke rate se bhi kam par kaam kar rahe hai
 The official rate is 240 rupees per period
 is hisaab se bhi shikshakon ko kam miltaa he
 Nearly 200 students study here
 yahaan par ek bhi shikshak permanent nahin he
 Colleges in India are warehouses to enslave teachers
 chaatro ko barbaad karne kaa kaarkaana
 Just ten km from the village where the college is located, is the village of Punjab Rao Deshmukh, India's first agriculture minister
 shikshak kehete hai ki paanch hazaar rupee main ham kaise jivan chalaayenge

 Should the factory of waste of time be closed in the name of higher education in India or should the colleges be exported to India along with teachers

 As we are about to export teachers

 balrampur ke kalege kaa haal dikhaane ke baad ek chaatr ne messej kiya, kaha ki aapane yah to bataaya nahin ki prayogshaala main paas karaane ke liye shikshak yaa sahaayak paise lete hai
 They earn a lot
 hamaare paas aisi baton kii jaanch karne ke liye utani badi team nahin he
 To cover the state of India's higher education, two lakh correspondents and twenty thousand correspondents are needed, which we do not have
 bharat ke kalege bharat kii javaaniyon kalejon main aakar kabad ban jaati hai
 By the way, the science in which science is dying

 Students' union elections are going on in this college

 The college building is sick

 The floor is broken

 It seems that the students of this college do not feel thirsty
 unhone nal kaa istamaal karnaa 21veen sadi ke shuru hote hi band kar diya he
 When there is no drinking water then why is there a toilet
 kya yah vigyaan kaa koi chamatkaar he yaa phir hamaari barbaadi kaa sanskaar
 There was a lock in a toilet, the woman is near the principal's cabin so they locked it
 prisimple ashavan hai ki sab kuch thik ho jayega
 Check the condition of this toilet of KB College

 The same guideline in which applications have been sought from 20 colleges to become world class universities

 This thing sounded like a dream
 yahaan to ek bhi teacher nahin hai or jahaan ek hai un par 20 nahin,1200 tak chaatr hai

 uniwarsity ne sarkaar ke paas prastaav bheja he ki 130 se zyaada shikshakon kii zarurat he, How did you like this fourteenth issue of the university series, not us, tell your neighbor, discuss among yourself what to do
 kya bharat main ucch shiksha ke naam par samay kii barbaadi kaa kaarkaana band kar diya janaa chahie yaa shikshakon ke saath saath bharat ko kalege kaa bhi niryaat karnaa chahie
 If we wish, we can export these colleges which are lying unused

 Let's take a break
 praani vibhaag kii imaarat main lagata he praan hi nahin bache hai
 No creature will come here
 kalege kii imaarat biimaar he
 You see the condition of the building of KB PG College
 farsh tut chuki he
 See the condition of drinking water system
 aisa lagata he ki is kalege ke chaatro ko pyaas hi nahin lagati he
 They have stopped using the tap as early as the 21st century
 jab pani nahin pite hai to phir shauchalay kyon he
 Is it a miracle of science or a sacrament of our ruin
 ek shauchalay main taala laga hua tha, mahila principal ke cabin ke paas he isliye unhone band kar diya
 The principals are hopeful that everything will be alright
 ke bi kalege ke is shauchalay kaa haal dekh lijie
 What to expect is that Home Minister Rajnath Singh will change the condition of this college in his home district
 bahut se reporter gujarat chunaav ke sandarbh main ek hi netaa ko rose intervyuu le rahe hai unhen gujarat ke kalejon main janaa chahie
 In the college where the Prime Minister has studied
 taaki tulana kii ja sake ki apane apane kalejon kaa khyaal rakhane main, vikaas karne main grahamantri rajnath singh behatar hai yaa pradhanmantri modi
 Politics is also better than such healthy competition
 mirzapur kaa doosraa kalege he kamala aryakanya snatakottar mahavidlaay
 Completed in 1968
 meerajapur kaa ek maatr mahila kalege he
 The college building from outside looks just fine
 vibhinn vishyon main kareeb 1200 chaatro kaa yahaan bhavishya sanvar rahaa he
 Girls of Hindi class told that if no teacher has come for many days, then what to do, only gossip will do
 ek class main padhai chal rahi thi
 We saw the guidelines of the UGC
 vahi guideline jisamen vishwa stareey uniwarsity banane ke liye 20 kalejon se aavedan maanga gaya he
 It states that to become a world class, there should be 20 students per 1 teacher
 yah baat kisi khwab kii tarah lagi
 There is not a single teacher here and where there are one, there are not 20 but 1200 students
 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle or chunaavon ke baad pradhanmantri modi kaha karte the ki bharat shikshakon kaa niryaat karegaa
 Then i also felt that it was very good
 shikshakon ke niryaat kaa idia bhi nayaa he vaise kis desh main aaayaatit shikshakon kaa intazaar ho rahaa he pataa nahin
 There may be a country like this, but during the university series it has been understood that at this time India needs to import teachers
 shahar shahar ke kalege bina shikshakon ke suune pade hai
 Will talk about exports later
 pehle apane kalejon main shikshakon ke pad ko chaatro kii nai sankhya ke hisaab se moolyankan ho
 On 26 December 2014, the Prime Minister laid the foundation of the New Teacher Training Scheme at BHU and said that India should aim to export top class teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki duniya hamaari taraf dekh rahi he magar taiyaar nahin he
 Colleges of India will also be looking towards anyone, nobody is ready for them
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne pandit madan mohan malviya neshnal mishan aan teacher and training kii buniyaad rakhi thi
 It is the latest situation of this important scheme of 900 crores that the Director has been appointed
 biechayu ke paanch acre zamin de di he or yahaan bhawan banane ke tender kii prakriya shuru ho gai he
 Tender of the scheme which the Prime Minister has launched also takes three years to start
 philhal itani hi jaankaree mili he
 At that time the Prime Minister had said that there is a lot of demand for teachers
 unhone kaha tha ki bharat kii shiksha vyavastha robot banane ke liye nahin banaai gai he
 We produce a culture of tradition-based education
 shikshakon ke niryaat kii baat pradhanmantri ne medicin scavyar par bhi kii thi
 Speeches are available on pmindia's website
 28 sitambar 2014 ko kaha tha ki 2020 ke samay aate aate duniya main itani badi maatra main varccourse kii zarurat padane vaali he

 He said the same thing on 17 November 2014 at Allphones Arena in Sydney

 Millions of schools and thousands of colleges in India need teachers in all subjects from Maths, Science, History, Hindi, Sanskrit
 noujvaan ujisi kii net pariksha paas kar naukariyon ke intazaar main buudhe ho rahe hai
 Every day, with a b

 niryaat karne kaa idia acha he magar wo itnaa acha laga ki khyaal hi nahin aayaa ki hamaare pados ke kalege ko bhi shikshakon ke aayaat kii zarurat he
 Amravati district is considered to be the education hub of Maharashtra as it has everything from engineering to medical
 privet bhi or sarkari bhi
 Our colleague Sanjay Shinde went to Wadhona Ramnath village in Amravati district
 amravati shahar se maatr 45 kimi dur he yah gaanv
 The village has a population of five thousand
 kisaan hi rahete hai
 Seeing this college running in three to four rooms, the Prime Minister can certainly be told that before the teacher's export, you should export such colleges from India
 yah kalege baarah saal se chal rahaa he
 Is private but accredited with Amravati University
 na to iske baad khel kaa maidan he, na hi prayogshaala he
 The children of nearby farmers take admission here to study in college
 yahaan par kai saal se kaam kar rahe shikshakon ko maatr 5000 rupee selary milti he
 Nutanam is working at less than the wages, less than the MNREGA rate

 According to this also teachers get less

 Many reporters are interviewing the same leader daily in the context of Gujarat elections, they should go to colleges in Gujarat
 us kalege main jahaan pradhanmantri padhe hai
 So that a comparison can be made whether Home Minister Rajnath Singh is better at taking care of his colleges or for development or Prime Minister Modi
 is tarah ke swasthy mukaable se raajnneeti bhi behatar hoti he
 The second college in Mirzapur is Kamala Aryakanya Postgraduate Mahavidlaya

 This thing sounded like a dream
 yahaan to ek bhi teacher nahin hai or jahaan ek hai un par 20 nahin,1200 tak chaatr hai
 Before the Lok Sabha elections and after the elections, Prime Minister Modi used to say that India will export teachers

 The idea of export of teachers is also new, although in which country imported teachers are waiting
 ho saktaa he aisa koi desh ho magar uniwarsity series ke dauraan yah baat samaj main aa gai he ki bharat ko is vakt shikshakon ke aayaat kii zarurat he
 Colleges in the city are deserted without teachers
 niryaat kii baat baad main karenge
 First, the position of teachers in their colleges should be evaluated according to the new number of students
 26 disambar 2014 ko pradhanmantri ne biechayu main new teacher training skim kii buniyaad rakhte hue kaha tha ki bharat ko taap class shikshakon ke niryaat kaa lakshya rakhana chahie
 He said that the world is looking at us but is not ready

 On September 28, 2014, it was said that by the time of 2020, such a large amount of workcourse will be needed in the world

 The world will not have workmen

 Today there is a demand for teachers in the world
 Maths or Science ke teachers nahin milte hai
 Can India not export these teachers? yahi baat unhone 17 november 2014 ko sidney ke alphons arina main kahi thi
 We had said in Sydney that we export the best quality teacher in the world, we can make the whole world our own

 Teachers working here for many years get a salary of only 5000 rupees

 This time too there is excitement but all those questions are about which the Indian media has stopped talking now
 aisa nahin he ki america media se pradhanmantri modi kaa rishta nahin rahaa he
 When Prime Minister Modi had completed two years of his tenure, he gave his only interview to the American Wall Street Journal
 2014 ke daure par neuyork times kii surkhi kya thi
 New York Times: "defying Expectations in India, Modi begins key trip to US" (september 25) dangon ko lekar aarope main sazaa ke taur par jis netaa ko ek dashak tak america ne visa nahin diya, vahi modi ab neuyork aae hai or wo bhi ek lokapriy netaa ke taur par or saath hi ek aavashyak partner ke taur par, jo ki china ke badhate hue prabhaav ko balance karne main sakasham he

 Indian media and politics have also stopped talking about them

 hindi vaala paraayaa nahin, angreji ke paraayaa kaa matlab yah hua ki aisa vyakti jise pasand na kiya jaataa ho
 For the fourth time in two years, the Prime Minister has gone to America and why the newspaper there felt the need to make this headline
 4 june ko mathew pennington ne apni report kii pehali pankti main likhaa he ki kai saal tak america ne visa nahin diya magar ab bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa mehmaan ke rup main swaagat ho rahaa he
 i was surprised to read this report of the Washington Post, why all these things are happening right now
 phir se kyon ho rahi hai
 The newspaper writes that Modi has dropped allegations of involvement in anti-muslim riots
 ho saktaa he ki america saansad unase unke maanavadhikaar record ke bare main sawaal kar den
 India and BJP have had a strong focus on America, but even then a big newspaper does not write the name of the ruling party but it is their fourth visit since their Hindu Nationalist Party came to power in May 2014
 2005 se 2013 ke bich gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par america sarkaar ne unase sarkari sampark banane se bachanaa chaha kyonki use shaq tha ki unki un dangon main bhoomika he jisamen hazaron log marege the
 The Washington Post has not denied the importance of his visit, talked about those possibilities, but what does it mean to reverse the pages of the past

 On the other hand, Modi has spent a large part of his life as a Sangh activist

 Modi was the chief of Gujarat when there were riots in 2002 and a large number of Muslims died in those riots

 This party used to talk about white supremacy but it also emerged and ended in the same decades
 main iskaa zikr isliye kar rahaa hum ki neuyork times ek aise agyaat dal se bharat ke pradhanmantri kii chhavi kii tulana kyon kar rahaa he
 Even the New York Times writes that Obama is a good husband
 pita hai
 Friendship with children
 magar modi kii kisi se saarvajanik dosti nahin he or unhone apni patni ko bhi chhod diya he
 The New York Times wrote that Prime Minister Modi tried to suppress dissent by using old laws and silenced ngos like Green Peace

 It is not that Prime Minister Modi has no relationship with the American media
 pradhanmantri modi ne apane kaarykaal ke do saal puure kiye the to unhone apana ekmaatr intervyuu america ke hi akhbaar wal street jarnal ko diya
 What made the New York Times headlines on the 2014 tour
 New York Times: "defying Expectations in India, Modi begins key trip to US" (september 25) Modi, who has not been granted a visa by the US for a decade as a punishment for the riots, has now come to New York and he is also a popular leader as well as an essential partner, who is China Is able to balance the growing effect

 This time the Washington Post and the New York Times have not only questioned Obama and Modi's natural friendship, but have taken a lot of interest in their disputed past
 inhen lekar bhartiya media or raajnneeti ne bhi kareeb kareeb baat hi karnaa band kar diya he
 The Washington Post is in the news Indian PM, once a pariah to US, set to address Congress

 Is the media there apprehensive about this refreshment in indo-american relations
 bharat ke media main bharat or america ke bich ban rahe in sambandhon ko lekar kaaphi utsaah dikhataa he
 In the New York Times of June 5, Gardiner Harris, while talking about the possibility of the importance of the tour, suddenly writes that 'the two are discussing friendship, but this friendship does not seem natural
 ' Questioning the friendship between Obama and Modi, the New York Times begins to compare the two leaders as to what their image is in the minority community in their respective countries

 yah dal white yani shwet kii sarvocchata kii baat karata tha magar unheen dashakon main ubhar kar samaapt bhi ho gaya
 i am referring to this why the New York Times is comparing the image of the Prime Minister of India to such an unknown party
 yahaan tak ki neuyork times likhata he ki obama ek achche pati hai
 Is the father
 bacchon ke saath dosti he
 But Modi has no public friendship with anyone and has also left his wife
 neuyork times ne likhaa he ki pradhanmantri modi ne puraane kanoonon kaa istemaal kar asahmati dabaane kaa prayaas kiya or green pis jaise enjio kaa munh band kiya
 These newspapers have taken the opinion of many think tanks in their reports
 jinke bare main varisht patrkaar ashok malik ne twit kiya he ki 'disi main jin logon ko main jaanata hum wo baaki aadhe bache logon kaa intervyuu le rahe hai
 ' congress or sinet kii videsh sambandh cametiyon ke swaagat samaaroh main hissaa lenaa, sansad ko sambodhit karnaa, kya america saansadon, sinetaron or pradhanmantri modi ke liye ek duusare ko kareeb se jaanane kaa mauka nahin milegaa
 When Parliamentarians visited President Clinton in India, Indian lawmakers became restless to join hands with him

 aparajita sharmine dinon beemaa companiyaan varisht nagarikon ko health kawarej muhaiyaa kar rahi hai
 They have either brought special schemes for them or they have added special features for senior citizens in general schemes
 diabetes or dil ke rogiyon ke liye bhi vishisht plan hai
 However, senior citizens' plans include a number of warnings that are not included in the general health insurance, for example, more co-pays, rigorous medical tests, lack of special facilities and for people with pre-existing diseases (PED) Much longer waiting period
 zyada premiumbima main saamaanya siddhant he 'jitani zyada umr, utana zyada premium'
 This is even more true in the case of health insurance, as the chances of medical problems are also more with increasing age
 alabatta varisht nagarikon ke liye tamaam policiyon ke premium main baari fark he—religare health insurance kii care senior policy main salanaa premium 24,645 rupye he, jabaki maiks boopa health insurance kii health compainian policy salanaa 46,040 rupye kaa premium vasuul karti he
 This difference is largely due to the difference in co-payment or co-payment — the higher the co-payment, the lower the premium
 sah-bhugtan se premium kam ho saktaa haisah-bhugtan main policy dharak ko apane ilaaj kaa ek nishchit pratishat kharch khud uthaanaa hota he or baaki beemaa company bhugtan karti he
 For example, Star Health Insurance's Senior Citizen Red Corp plan has a mandatory provision of 30% (50% in case of pre-existing diseases) co-payment
 10 lakh rupye kii bimit raashi ke liye salanaa premium 26,550 rupye he
 Suppose someone claims a bill of 10 lakh rupees after paying the premium for 10 years — then according to the policy he will have to pay 3 lakh rupees (30 per cent) himself, while the insurance company will pay the rest
 asal main, us beemaa dharak ko kul 5
 65 lakhs to be repaid — 3 lakhs of co-payment and 2
 65 lakh rupye sanchayi premium ke
 In comparison, the annual premium of Max Bupa Health Insurance Company's Health Companion Policy is Rs 46,040, with no co-payment required
 isliye agar koi 10 saal baad 10 lakh rupye kaa daawa karata he, to use premium ke taur par kul 4
 6 lakh rupees will have to be paid (although the insurance company pays the full amount of the medical bill)
 to kya sah-bhugtan se bachanaa behatar hoga? jaruri nahin he
 Amit Chhabra, business head of Health Insurance, policybazaar
com, says, "it would be good if you had a comprehensive plan without co-payment, as there are no limitations
" lekin agar aap umr yaa pehle se maujuud bimariyon kii vajah se iske paatr na hon, to aap sah-bhugtan ke vikalp vaala plan chun sakate hai
 "insurance conditions and limitations Since seniors are more likely to have age-related diseases like cataract, diabetes and high blood pressure, it is important to see if the policy covers such diseases fully
" varisht nagarikon ke zyaadaatar plan bimariyon par aadhaarit simaaon ke saath aate hai
 For example, joint managing director of Star Health and Allied Insurance, Dr
 es
 Prakash says that the limit of claim for heart-related diseases on policies with an insured amount of Rs 5 lakh is almost 2
 5 lakh rupye ke aasapaas hoti he
 It is necessary to keep such diseases in mind before purchasing a policy
 khaas bimariyon ke liediabetes or dil kii beemaari vaale logon ke liye beemaa lenaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 However, insurance companies are trying to get a policy for such customers as well
 religare health insurance ke emdi or siio anuj gulati kehete hai, ''ham diabetes ke liye or yahaan tak ki insulin par nirbhar marijon ke liye bhi ek khaas plan—care freedom—kii peshkash karte hai
 Not only this, our care heart plan is suitable for those who have undergone cardiac surgery like angioplasty or stent implant
 ''isse milte-julate duusare plan main star health insurance kaa diabetes sef plan shaamil he jisamen salanaa premium 21,240 rupye or bimit raashi 5 lakh rupye he
 Apollo Munich Health Insurance's Energy Silver plan provides the same coverage at a premium of Rs 30,291 annually
 yah 'no clem bonus' yani daawa nahin karne par bonus bhi detaa he—harek clem mukt saal ke liye buniyadi bimit raashi main 10 fisadi kii badhotaree, jo adhiktam 100 fisadi tak ho sakati he
 Revision of premium till now it was not possible to take insurance at the age of 75
 aaj zyaadaatar yojanaayen is umr ke logon ko lakshya kar rahi hai, masalan, religare health ke care senior, care freedom or care heart plan or echdiefasi argo kaa maay: health suraksha plan umr ke bandhan ke bagaiyr aate hai
 IRDAI has made it mandatory for insurance companies to renew policies throughout their lives
 haalanki iske saath harek paanch yaa kuch varshon main premium main bhi badlaav kiya ja saktaa he
 Sanjay Dutta, head of ICICI Lombard General Insurance underwriting, claims, reinsurance and actuaries, says that for people 65 and older, the premium can increase by an average of 25 per cent every five years
 alabatta hameshaa aisa hota nahin he
 Dr
 of Star Health Insurance prakaash kehete hai ki company ne varisht nagarikon ke liye premium pichley 12 saal se badhaayaa nahin he
 Some companies offer special plans, in which the premium settles at one age
 echdiefasi argo general insurance ke accident and health ke president anuraag rastogi kehete hai, ''maay: health suraksha main 71 kii umr ke baad or maay: health medicyor super top ap policy main 61 kii umr ke baad premium sthir ho jate hai, jab tak ki iardi tamaam umr or virgon ke liye policy main badlaav kii ijaajat nahin detaa
 "how important is the investigation
 Most health plans of senior citizens require a lot of medical examination
 haalanki kuch companiyaan aisi jaanch ke bagaiyr bhi bime kii peshkash karti hai
 Religare Health and Star Insurance are two such companies
 star ke red carpet plan main agar kharidaar kuch nishchit medical report, jaise stress thelium report blad report or sugar report (khun or peshaab, khaali pet or khaane ke baad), muhaiyaa karvaa detaa he, to beemaa company premium par 10 fisadi kii chhot kii peshkash karne ko bhi taiyaar ho sakati he
 Most senior citizens plans also offer annual health checkups
 religare health ke gulati kehete hai, ''hamaare sabhi product bagaiyr kisi atirikt kharch ke salanaa health chekup kii peshkash karte hai
 These can be molded according to the needs of senior citizens
 '' policiyaan phaaydon ke saath bhi aati hai
 For example, complementary access to the doctor when needed, discounts for those who are fit, etc

 After the incident spread in the people of the state, people are scared all over the state, and it seems that now the conflict between Mayawati and the central government will increase

 The government is making various schemes to get better and accurate employment figures in the country
 isi prayaas ke tahat ab naukari badalane vaale logon par najar rakhane kaa ek system laane kii yojana he taaki rojgaar kii samgr tasviir saamne aa sake
 Such steps have become necessary for the government facing the attacks of opposition on the employment front
 angreji akhbaar iconomic times ke anusaar, philhal karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi (EPFO) ke dwaara har maah rojgaar ke liye jari hone vaale aankadon main nae banane vaale sabsakribar, naukari chhod dene yaa naukari badalane yaa rojgaar main antaraal ke baad phir judane vaale logon ke aankade ko shaamil kiya jaataa he
 But the figures of those who quit or delayed joining are not considered reliable
 waapas aakar phir naukari karne waalon ke aankade taiyaar karne kii vyavastha bahut acchhee nahin he
 After the new system, more robust data will be available
 iske baad vishuddh rojgaar sankhya jari ho sakegi
 It is worth noting that since April 2018, the employment data is being released every month and data has been taken till September 2017
 is vyavastha main kai khamiyaan hai jinaki vajah se isse saaf tasviir nahin mil paati ki arthvyavastha main kitne nae rojgaar kaa srijan hua
 The reason for this is that only such firms come under the ambit of provident fund, which has 20 or more employees
 is tarah kai sookshm, laghu or madhyam udhyam main kaam karne vaale karmchaaree aankadon ke daayre se baahar rah jate hai
 In addition, inclusion in the ambit of EPFO is also not mandatory for those employees whose salary is Rs 15,000 per month
 ipiefo main shaamil hone vaale logon kii sankhya badhane kii ek vajah yah bhi ho sakati he ki notebandi ke baad or jiesti apnaane se arthvyavastha kaa aupchaarikaran badha he or yah ho saktaa he ki rojgaar ke kuch bade aankade is vajah se dikh rahe hon ki anaupchaarik naukariyon ko aupchaarik naukariyon main badal diya gaya he
 The latest figures show that EPFO subscribers have reached a 17-month high of 8,96,000 in January
 gauratlab he ki rojgaar ke morche par sarkaar ko lagaataar vipaksh ke hamale kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 All the media reports also claimed that the unemployment rate has reached the record level of 45 years in the last financial year
 haalanki sarkari paksh kaa kahana he ki rojgaar sirf naukariyon ke aankade nahin hota, mudra yojana ke labhaarthiyon ko bhi rojgaar ke aankadon main shaamil karnaa hoga

 '' Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav has been granted bail by the Supreme Court
 chaara ghotaale main lalu ko paanch saal kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 On November 25, Lalu Prasad filed a bail application in the Supreme Court in the fodder scam case
 karodon rupee ke chaara ghotaale main lalu ko sashram paanch saal kii jail kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 Lalu Prasad challenged the interim decision of the Jharkhand High Court on October 31, in which his bail application was rejected
 ranchi main sibiai kii ek vishesh adaalat ne 30 sitambar ko chaara ghotaale main lalu prasad, bihar ke hi ek anya purv mukhyamantri jagannatha mishra, janata dal (united) ke saansad jagadish sharma sahit anya ko doshi tehraaya tha

" Laloo's son Tejashwi Yadav said, 'we had full faith in the Supreme Court
 jald hi chunaav ladane ke liye bhi lalu ji yogya ho jaaenge
 Whichever party's people have hatched this conspiracy, they will be shocked by this decision
 'kapil sibbal ne is par pratikriya dete hue kaha, 'sabakuch kanoon ke mutabik hona chahie
 It is good that the Supreme Court granted bail to Lalu ji
 ham desh kii sarvocch court ke faisle kaa swaagat karte hai
 Prior to the decision, Lalu's wife and former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi had targeted Nitish Kumar, saying, "nitish Kumar claims a clean image, if that is the case, he should come out in front of everyone

 ' uttar pradesh kebundelkhandashetra ke hamirpur janapad ke kundara gaanv main sirf mahilaayein hi holi khelti hai
 It is forbidden for men to play Holi
 dilachasp baat he ki jab desh-videsh main purush samudaay holi ke din rang main ranga hota he or iskaa anand le rahaa hota he, vahiin bundelkhand ke is chote se gaanv main holi ke din purush kheton main yaa kisi duusare kaam se baahar chale jate hai
 It is not even interesting to wear the veil
 It is generally interesting that while the children are eager to play Holi throughout the year and buy colors from the pitch, the children of Kundra village wear clean clothes in the houses on this festival of colors
 Remain the same
 aisa lagata he, maano holi nahin, diwali ho
 The women of the village remain completely free on this day
 saal ke 364 din jo mahilaayein gaanv ke bujurgon ke saamne parde main rahati hai, ve holi ke din kisi se ghunghat nahin karatin
 The people of the village say that on the day of Holi, women of the whole village gather in the Ramjanaki temple of the village and play Holi with pomp after singing the song
 kya he is parampara kii vajahadilawar singh, ramdin meshram or vivek thakur ne bataaya ki kai dashak pehle holi ke hi din gaanv ke log ramjanaki mandir main phag ga rahe the, tabhi ek inami dakait member singh ne rajpal paal naam ke shaks kigoli maar kar hatyakar di thi
 After this incident, Holi was not celebrated in this village for many years
 mahilaon ne kii pahalkuch saal tak to mahilaayein chup raheen, phir unhone purushon ko samajhane kii koshish kii or jab ve nahin maane to gaanv kii sabhi mahilaayein usee ram janaki mandir main ikattha huin or faisla kiya ki holi ke din gaanv kii sabhi mahilaayein puri rasm ke saath tyohaar manaaengi
 There will be no participation of men in this
 tabhi se gaanv main sirf mahilaayein holi khelti hai
 a lot of time has passed, but this is probably the only unique village where only women power enjoys playing Holi

 The ongoing riot in the Samajwadi Party is the Mahabharata of the modern era in which there is a battle of relationships and politics
 jis tarah dwapar yug kii mahabharat main shanti kii koshishen fail ho gai thi usee prakaar yahaan bhi aisa hi hua he
 Both the armies are face to face in the Election Commission, where both have their own Arjuna and Krishna and both are telling their Arjuna that rise up Parth and Gandeev, the relationship and not politics is important
 is mahabharat main bhi rishton or raajnneeti ke ahm or vaham kaa hi bolbalaa he
 However, the foot soldiers of both the armies are not yet aware that their army will make arsenal on their hands? All is in ahem and vaham that the order of invasion will be stopped and Bhishma Pitamah will be the commander of the joint army and Arjun will be given a bicycle, meaning the five villages will be given to the Pandavas

 baharhaal, dekhnaa yah he ki band aage kya rang laata he
 Hi
 
 i am Ravish Kumar
 kisi bhi pradhanmantri ko apane hisaab se team banane kii chhot honi chahie
 It depends entirely on their discretion as to which person they consider worthy of the task
 yahaan tak kisi ko bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke pradhan sachiv ke maamle main etraz nahin hona chahie or vipaksh ne apni pratikriya main yah baat saaf-saaf kahi bhi
 If this is the right thing in principle, then why not let the Prime Minister do whatever he has to do to keep the Principal Secretary of his choice? But it should also be kept in mind that the responsible people sitting at the top of the power also maintain a pattern, which is equally applicable to everyone
 kya pradhan sachiv nripendra mishra ke maamle main aisi paripati bani he? Nripendra Mishra's ability to give a shingle to everyone
 jis uttar pradesh se unhone aies kii yatra shuru kii, vahaan unki prashasnic kshamta kii tarif main bolne vaale kai log mil jaaenge
 Due to his credibility, Nripendra Mishra has held responsible positions in every government
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri kalyaan singh ke mukhya sachiv se lekar kendriya vitt mantralay main bhi kaam kar chuke hai
 From 2006 to 2009, he was the Chairman of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
 2 ji ghotaale ke maamle main ahm gavaah bhi hai, jab e raja ne telecom mantri rahete hue pehle aao,pehle paao kii vivaadit niti shuru kii thi, tab nripendra mishra hi chairman the
 A
 Raja had said that the policy of first come first served was advised by TRAI
 lekin nripendra mishra ne kaha tha ki yah galat baat he or ve hameshaa nilami ke zariye license die jane kii baat karte rahe hai
 The prices of 3G spectrum were fixed during these hours
 1967 batch ke iees adhikari rahe hai or tri chairman banane se pehle hi ritair ho chuke hai
 TRAI is a regulatory body, which acts as a regulator between telecom companies and the government
 iskaa adhyaksh swatantra rahe or kisi pralobhan main na aae, isliye is pad se ritair hua vyakti centre yaa rajya sarkaar main koi pad nahin le saktaa
 But on May 26, two days after taking oath as Prime Minister, on May 28, Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued an ordinance and appointed Nripendra Mishra as its Principal Secretary
 mishra tri ke chairman pad se ritair hone ke baad koi pad nahin le sakate the
 An ordinance was first issued to change the same rule, then today Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad introduced a bill in the Lok Sabha and said that the decision has been taken on merit
 nae bill main kaha gaya he ki tri ke pad se ritair hone vaala vyakti ab do saal tak sarkari yaa telecom company main koi pad nahin legaa
 The earlier rule was that one can never take the post after retirement, but now he can take it after two years
 aap jaanate hai ki nripendra mishra 2009 main ritair hue the
 More than two years have passed
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki telecom regulatory athurity ke chairman kaa pad behad samvedansheel he
 a similar arrangement is also in the Central Vigilance Commission Act
 bhrashtachar par nigaraanee rakhane kii sabase badi agency kaa mukhiya bhi ritair hone ke baad koi sarkari pad nahin le saktaa he
 Tomorrow, a government can bring a new law for the person who has retired as the chairman of the CVC and can hand over the post
 in padon par rahane vaale vyakti ko kisi bhi prakaar ke pralobhan se dur rakhane kaa kavach samaapt ho saktaa he
 So many opposition leaders from Rajya Sabha to Lok Sabha questioned why the ordinance and then the law are being made for an officer
 ab main apane mehmaanon se samajhane kaa prayaas karuunga ki upie kyrkaal main sonia gandhi ke offis aaf proffit kaa vivaad hua tha wo iske samanaantar he yaa nahin
 The year of this dispute was 2006
 isamen kai saansadon ko offis of proffit se bachaane ke liye adhyadesh laayaa gaya tha
 Among them were Sonia Gandhi and Somnath Chatterjee
 adhyadesh main inke dwaara hasil tamaam padon ko offis of proffit ke daayre se baahar kar diya gaya
 Jaya Bachchan's membership was terminated in a similar case
 vahiin saal 2013 main uttarakhand congress sarkaar ke mantri harak singh ravat par bhi offis of proffit kaa maamla bana tha
 The state government, through an ordinance, removed many posts from the Office of Profit
 vahiin bijepi kii maang thi ki ravat kii vidhansabha sadsyta radd kar di jaae
 Since coming to power, the Prime Minister has consistently been taking the initiative and advocating to make his bureaucracy professional and better
 unhen nirbhik hokar kaam karne or idia saajha karne kaa hausala dilaate rahe hai
 In this sequence, when some ministers wanted to appoint officers posted during the UPA government in their office, the PMO stopped
 is paimaane se kaaphi hadakamp much gaya tha, jab modi ne apane party adhyaksh or grahamantri rajnath singh ke privet secetry kii file roak di thi
 Many senior ministers also suffered such setbacks, but it was a good thing that none of the ministers protested
 sabane ek peshewar team banane kii disha main sahmati jataai
 But it was written in the newspapers that Nripendra Mishra also became the chairman of TRAI during the tenure of Manmohan Singh
 isi tarah se manmohan sarkaar ke ek or adhikari ko modi ne apana nijee sachiv rakh liya
 Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth, appointed during the tenure of the Manmohan government, was given a six-month extension and r Ramanujam, who was Secretary in the PMO, was also given a three-month extension
 piemo main ek adhikari kii niyukti ke saarvajanik soochna jari hoti he or agle din radd kar di jaati he
 The PMO decides what will be the scale of officers working under ministers, but PM himself brings officers from Gujarat cadre for himself
 is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki pradhanmantri jab apni team nahin bana sakate, to koun bana saktaa he? For 17 years this law of TRAI continued from NDA to two governments of UPA
 kisi ne is praavdhaan ko badalane kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 Is the opposition raising the right question that a law is being made for an officer
 tri jaisi swytt sanstha se chhedchhad kii ja rahi he, jisaki swytt bhoomika 2 ji maamle main kaaphi dekhi gai thi
 The bill is also the first test of the Modi government's power test within the House
 rajya sabha main bijepi yaa endie ke paas bahumat nahin he, abhi kahana mushkil hoga ki sarkaar nahin juta paaegi, magar har haal main 14 agast ko is bill ko paas karana hi hoga

 On the other hand, if the West Indies win the three-match series 3–0, then they and England will retain the series rankings
 australia ke paas chauthe, jabaki england ke paas chathe sthaan par pahunchane kaa mauka hoga
 Meanwhile, Indian vice captains Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh have been able to make a place in the batting rankings for India

 Ravi Shankar Prasad also questioned Congress President Sonia Gandhi whether the question mark that former finance minister p Chidambaram has put on the surgical strike is the official stand of the Congress

 The information department said in a statement that the incident took place at Ratu Lettianara College in Serua province
 barkhaast kiye gaye shikshak ke bare main vivaranon kaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya he
 Education Minister Mahendra Reddy has described the incident as unacceptable and a violation of the right to honor students
 reddy ne kaha ki vah fiji ke sabhi shikshakon ko spasht kar dena chaahate hai ki unhen peshewar aacharan ke ucch maanak viksit karne kii jarurat he

 lekin hindutv kaa yah cheharaa or rajya kaa siem apni hi seat gorakhpur ke upachunaav main pichley dinon buree tarah haar chukaa he
 Along with the defeat of the BJP candidate from Gorakhpur, even Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya in Phulpur could not save the bjp's respect
 is badi haar ke baad press ko sambodhit karte hue yogi ne kaha tha ki bhaajapa atiaatmavishvaas ke kaaran haari
 It was believed that this is a lesson for the Yogi government and the BJP and from here the process of defeat of the BJP will stop

 For Kairana, it is being said that a speech of Yogi took the BJP there
 kairana main bhaajapa kii jeet ke liye jat vot sabase mahatvapurn tha
 The Jats also proved this by supporting the BJP in the last Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections
 lekin jab upachunaav ke liye prachaar karne yogi kairana pahunche to vahaan unhone kuch aisa kah diya jisase jat vot bhaajapa ke khilaaf ho gaya
 In fact, rld's Jat leader Ajit Singh had put his full strength in this election as it became a battle for his supremacy
 chunaav ke liye vipaksh kaa pratyaashee bhi areldi kii ore se hi diya gaya tha
 But Jats were confused whether to support Ajit Singh or stay with the BJP
 bhaajapa ne mujffarnagar dangon main jaaton ke khilaaf maamle waapas lene kaa turup bhi khelaa
 The Jats also saw the possibility of voting against Muslims and standing with the BJP
 yogi kii galatilekin shamali main apni aakhri raily ko sambodhit karte hue yogi adityanath wo galati kar gaye jisaki keemat bhaajapa ko harkar chukaani padi
 Addressing the rally, Yogi said, "father-son (ajit Singh and Jayant) are begging street for votes today"
 ek gair-jat ke munh se jaaton ke ek netaa ke bare main aise shabd birdari ke logon ko katai pasand nahin aae
 He felt how a man from outside could go to his house by insulting his own brother and son so much
 jat birdari apni bhavukta or tevar ke liye jaani jaati he
 This thing of Yogi shocked many people
 yah baat agar koi jat netaa bhaajapa kii ore se kahata to shaayad jaaton ko itnaa bura na lagata
 But Yogi said this like a fire spread among the Jats overnight and the Jats rallied to teach them a lesson
 yogi kii yah galati kairana chunaav kaa terning point ban gai
 It is worth mentioning that Chaudhary Ajit Singh did one day and night in this election to save his political existence on the pretext of RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan
 jat samudaay ke ghar-ghar jaakar ajit singh or unke bete jayant singh ne tabassum ke liye vot maange the
 He reminded the Jats again and again that this is a question of community identity and respect

 ranjitkalakaararajnikant, radhika apte or dhanshikapichley do dashakon se bhartiya cinema kii ek khaasiyat jo ubhari he vah he vyakti puja kii
 Whether it is Khan or big names in the South, there comes a time when the subject, the story and the treatment are all left behind, and one dominates the art
 phir south main is vyakti puja kaa lanbaa itihaas bhi rahaa he
 In Bollywood, the glimpse of the actor growing up with the character was met with 'sultan' and this week with Rajinikanth's 'kabali', a clear indication of how much people mean to us
 postaron ko doodh se nahlaana, puja-paath or na jane kya-kya?rajnikantka kad 'kabali' ko shorgul main tabdeel karne main safal rahaa he
 When one is stepped into the cinema hall with a hype attached to Rajinikanth, then there is such a feeling in the heart that what to see on the screen? Expectations are very high
 shaayad 'kochaadeyan' or 'linga' main in ummiido ko thodaa jhatka pahunchaa tha
 Now with 'kabali', Rajinikanth raised a lot of expectations but on the story front the film is very common and the film rests solely on his charisma
 kahani main kitna damayah kahaneerajnikantki he jo ek lanbaa arsa jail main bitaata he, apane parivaar ko kho baithta he or dusron kii madad karne kii keemat chukaata he
 The story is set in India and abroad and the case is to raise the voice for the weak
 bilkul 'shivaji' or 'linga' jaise
 But this time is the background of the underworld
 kahani main kuch nayaa nahin he
 When Rajinikanth arrives, it is fun because his style looks fun, the story keeps creeping up and when it comes to Kabali's family, the film feels like a gasp
 kul milakar kahani main koi nayaapan nahin he, vaise bhi rajnikant apni filmon main itnaa kuch kar chuke hai, ab diarector ke liye bhi yah chunauti hoti he ki film main unase or kya karaayaa jaae
 Star appealif 'sultan' was seen only for 'sultan' Salman Khan in the past, then it is about 'kabali' as well
 puri film sirf ek shaks rajnikant ke karishme par hi tiki he
 His entry, his style, his fight, and everything that makes a bus conductor so big today
 lekin 65 saal ke ho chuke talaiva puri mehnat ke saath 'kabali' main aae hai par umr ke nishaan to najar aa hi jate hai
 This also affects their reflexes during the action
 film main radhika apte saamaanya hai, unki jagah koi or bhi actress hoti to khaas fark nahin padataa
 Other than that, everything else is fine
 kamai kii batkuch sitare aise hote hai jokamai ke maamle menkhushkismat hote hai
 Rajinikanth is also like this
 unki pichhali donon filmein bahut bada karishma na kar pai hon lekin ghate main bhi nahin raheen
 Now it is being said about 'kabali' that Rs 160 crore
 ke bajet se bani yah film 200 karod ru
 Already earned
 lekin film beshak relies se pehle jitani marji kamai kar le, uski asli kasuti to cinemaghar hi hote hai
 By the way, the advance booking of the film is solid and now it remains to be seen what records Rajinikanth leads the film
 'kabali' van time watch to he hi
 The film has been released in more than five languages
 film ke ek din main hone vaale sho kii sankhya bhi chah tak pahunch chuki he
 Whatever results the film will give, they will be judged in the coming times 'bahubali-2'

 COA was asked to stay till IPL before Virat Kohli had asked for different contracts for cricketers
 jisamen kaha gaya tha ki test, vanade or tii-20 cricket khilne vaale cricketrs ke liye do alag-alag contract hone chahie
 On this demand of Virat, the Administrators Committee had asked to wait till the completion of IPL-10
 isse ab alag-alag rakam milegicontract ke lagu ho jane par cricketron ko alag-alag rakam milegi
 For example, Mahendra Singh Dhoni now only plays ODI and T20, then he will get five crore rupees

 But cricketers like Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja and Ajinkya Rahane will get around Rs 10 crore annually

 ) According to the claims of the Delhi government, every merge drug will be free in government hospitals and patients will also be screened for free
 lekin dilli sarkaar ke aspataalon main is yojana ko lagu karana shuruaati dinon main mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 Somewhere there are long queues for medicines, at some places hospitals are facing shortage of staff
 muft dawa ke intjaar main dawaakhaane ke counter par lambii kataren lagi hai
 But the window through which the pharmacist reduces the pain of the patients by giving medicine, its doors are closed
 jahaan windo khuli hai, vahaan bhi marijon kii lambii katarensarkari aspatalonki badahaali kii kahani bayaan kar rahi hai
 Not only for medicines but also for a simple test like blood test, patients have to wait for hours
 dilli ke sarkari aspataalon kii khasta haalat ko sudhaarney kii koshish karte hue dilli sarkaar ne elaan kiya ki ek farvari sesarkari aspataalon main sabhi dawaaen muftamilengi
 But contrary to the government's claims, government hospitals do not appear to be fully prepared for the scheme
 sarkaar kii anivaary dawa suchi main kareeb 700 dawaaen shaamil hai
 Which is to be given free to the patients coming to the government hospitals
 lekin puraani dilli ke lok nayak jai prakaash aspataal kii suchi bataa rahi he ki kai dawaaen abhi bhi aspataal ke dawaakhaane main maujuud nahin hai
 The Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital in East Delhi has a similar situation
 kehane ko to dawa vitaran centre main 10 counter hai, lekin 10 main se 3 counter staff kii kami kii vajah se band hai
 So waiting for the medicine is increasing the pain of the patients and the victims
 haalankidawaonki uplabdhta ke maamle main purvi dilli ke laal bahadur shastri aspataal kaa haal alengepi or jitibi se behatar najar aayaa
 According to the hospital administration, the exercise to implement the government's plan has started
 dilli sarkaar ke mutabiyalge chaar maheene main rajdhani ke paanch bade sarkari aspataalon main 24 ghanton nishulk dawa milegi
 Now the question is that the hospitals which are already struggling with shortage of doctors and staff
 vahaan har marz kii dawa 24 ghante uplabdh karana dilli sarkaar ke liye ek badi chunauti he
 These are the reasons for the poor condition of the government hospital
 The Delhi government is promoting treatment centers like Mohalla clinics, poly clinics to reduce the pressure of increasing patients in government hospitals as per the plan to improve health services
 lekin jaanch upkarnon or davaaiyon kii kami kii vajah se log in kendron kaa puri tarah phayda nahin uthaa paa rahe hai
 The government has opened poly clinics under the pilot project
 aane vaale dinon main 150 mohalla clinics or 100 policlinics dilli ke alag alag vidhansabha kholane kii taiyaari bhi he
 But the problem is not just of infrastructure but also of manpower
 aspataal prashasan kii maane torajdhani ke sarkari aspataldoctoron or paramedical staff kii kami se jujh rahe hai
 However, the government is considering filling the vacant posts
 lekin philhal aspataalon main dawaaon ke kam se kam 12 ghante milane kii yojana par bhi staff kii kami kaa asar saaf dikh rahaa he
 Preparing to make government hospitals high-tech, the government is working on e-medical services to improve health services in Delhi
 takanic kii madad se abasarkaari aspataalon membhi jaldi or behatar ilaaj mil sakegaa
 No longer will you have to wait for hours to investigate in OPD
 dawaakhaane ke baahar bhi lambii linon ke saath baar-baar jaanch ke liye aspataalon ke chakkar bhi nahin lagane padenge
 Actually, the Delhi government is preparing to make government hospitals hi-tech with the help of technology
 yojana ke mutabik sarkari aspataalon main hone vaale sabhi jaanch ke liye marijon kaa sanpayspatalonmen liya jayega lekin inaki jaanch ab alag-alag aspataalon main naa hokar master lab main hogi
 For which the modern lab of Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital has been selected
 dilli sarkaar ke aspatalonmen ab marijon ke health card bhi banaae jaaenge
 In which the patient will have complete medical history
 is yojana ke istemaal se doctor kam vakt main zyada marijon kii jaanch kar paaenge
 However, the benefit of this scheme of Delhi government will be available only when the shortage of doctors and staff in government hospitals is overcome

 In Maharajganj district of Uttar Pradesh, the District General Secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Yuva Morcha hatched a conspiracy to be discussed which SP and Kotwal were troubled for 10 days to solve
 aakhirkaar police maamle kii tah tak pahunch hi gai
 The BJP leader and four of his associates were sent to jail after the Raj opened
 nagar palika kshetra ke pantnagar nivasee shivbhushan urf chanchal choube bijepi yuva morcha kaa teji se ubharta hua netaa tha
 His popularity was also increasing
 uski khwaahish thi ki vah ek licency asalha hasil kar le or jab sadak par nikle to uske aage peeche sarkari ganar chale
 But seeing the legal hurdle in it, he hatched a dangerous conspiracy, in which the police of Kotwali was involved for 10 days
 kareeb 10 din pehle bhartiya janata party yuva morcha kaa jila mantri chanchal choube apane mitra monu kashyap ke saath shahar ke ek sweet house main pahunchaa tha or icecream kaa order diya
 During this time, two of his summoned shooter Ravi Shankar Pandey, Bholu Singh alias Surendra Singh, escaped by firing a bullet
 police kii jaanch aage badi to jaanch ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki ghatana ke din aaropee chanchal choube or goli chalaane vaale hamalavar ek jagah saath nikalate hue sisitivi main dikh rahe hai
 Police also recovered CCTV footage
 police kii jaanch or aage badi to police ke shikanje se aaropee batch nahin paae
 The police arrested Chanchal Chaubey's friend and two shooters along with Tamanche
 police ne pistal saplir arun tiwari ko bhi giraftaar kar liya
 This is the case on August 2 in the Kotwali police station area of maharajangjj district, two rounds of bullets were fired at a sweets shop
 apane upar jaanaleva hamalaa kiye jane kii baat kah yuva bijepi netaa shivbhushan choube urf chanchal choube ne police adhikariyon or media ko ghatana kii jaankaree di
 The BJP leader who attacked him for his influence and fame was making good inroads in Maharajganj
