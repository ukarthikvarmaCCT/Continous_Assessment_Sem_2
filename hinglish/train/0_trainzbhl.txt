 When the daughter turned all her sorrows into 'strong wills' and showed her the courage to struggle continuously in life, then how would parents stay behind
 unhone bhi majbootee se beti kaa haath tham liya or uttar pradesh ke ek chote se shahar bareli kii vah vidhwaa yuvati aaj desh main leftinent ruchi verma kii nai or preranaaspad pahchaan ke saath kai mahilaon ke liye ummid kii kiran ban gai he
 When 'rank' came in front of the name, everything changed - first the clothes, then the hair and later a new identity was found
 ab wo duniya kii duusari sabase badi sena kaa hissaa he
 The saree has been replaced by green military uniform
 ruchi khud kahati hai ab uske kandhon par bahut badi jimmedaari aan padi he
 At first it was the responsibility of their little child
 ab use desh ke logon ke bharose par khara utarana he
 As of 30 April 2013, she had only such recognition that she is the wife of Major Vineet Verma in the Army
 us vakt kaam ke naam par bachche sanbhaalanaa, khaanaa bananaa, party atand karnaa or jab pati chhuttiyon main ghar aate to salbhar ke saare tyohaar unke saath manaanaa
 Something like this was a routine
 lekin 30 april 2013 ko achaanak jindagi main aisa jhatka laga ki jivan kii raftaar ke saath-saath sab-kuch tham sa gaya
 Major Vineet was martyred when it was learned that he was fighting in an anti-insurgency campaign in Assam
 aisa laga ki sari duniya hi ujaad gai
 It became difficult to cut a moment of life for interest
 kaise ve apane nanhe se bete akshat ko paalegi? kya ab bete ko sainya aan-baan-shaan ke bich wo parvarish mil paaegi jo uske pati ke rahete milti? akshat ko lekar pati ne sapane dekhe the ab wo sab taar taar ho gaye the
 Meanwhile, in the dark darkness, a ray of hope was seen that if she herself goes into the army, not only can she fulfill the unfulfilled dream of her husband but also raise her son in the army environment
 major vineet kii unit ke log or uske mata-pita madad ke liye aage aae
 It is understandable how the father of interest must overcome his fear to fulfill his daughter's dreams
 ruchi ke pita sudhir saxena kehete hai ki us vakt to main bas itnaa hi chahta tha ki ise jo sadma laga he usase ubar jaae
 Me and my wife just added interest
 yahaan ye bataanaa jaruri he ki saxena sahab ne khud miletry science main grajuation kiya he
 On getting the opportunity, read everything related to the army
 bete ko fouj main bhejnaa chaha par wo safal nahin ho paae
 Then when Major Vineet's proposal for marriage of interest came, he felt as if the wish of the mind was fulfilled
 donon parivaar kii marji se ruchi or major vineet kii do april 2006 main shaadi ho gai
 Interest got all the happiness of the world
 pati kii jahaan jahaan posting rahi vahaan vahaan gai
 The army knew well but when the husband posted on the 'line of Control', she started living in Delhi
 isi dauraan jab 2009 main donon kii jindagi main betaa akshat aayaa to khushiyon main or chaar chand lag gaye
 Both mian's wife would think of sending their son to a well-known school like Sherwood
 par kise pataa tha ki ek din aisa aayega ki sari khushiyon par grahan lag jayega
 Well, luck had something else approved
 major vineet ke shahid hone ke baad paanch maheene baad ruchi ne fouj main afasar banane ke liye farm bhar diya or pichley saal janvari main afasar banane ke liye jaruri esasabi pariksha bhi paas kar lee
 But all this was not easy because military training was not less than a big challenge till now for the interest of living a life of comfort and the biggest question was with whom would the little Akshat be with
 aise main ruchi ke mummy-papa ne akshat kii puri jimmevary sanbhali
 Ruchi went to Army's Officer Training Academy in Chennai to take 11 months of rigorous training
 ruchi bataati he, 'main vahaan par ek shahid afasar kii bivi banakar nahin gai thi balki ek train cadet ke taur par gai thi isliye galati karne par daant or dand bhi mila to acha karne par shaabaasi
 Learned a lot there
 pehle vineet ke bare main baat karke rone lagati thi ab vishwaas ke saath pati ke bare baat kar paati hum
 There is so much encouragement that i will raise my son alone
 ' After training, interest is now better understood by the Army than before
 aaj use apane pati par kahin zyada fakhr he
 She says, "how does the common man get rid of a little height and at the same time army men like Major Vineet play their duty at a height of thousands of feet
 ' apni shaadi ke saat saal main se pati ke saath mahaj do saal gujaarne vaali ruchi ko is baat kii kasak to he ki use apane pati ke saath bahut kam vakt guzarane kaa mauka mila kyonki zyaadaatar samay uske pati kii field posting rahi lekin sena main shaamil hokar vah major vineet kii mazaboori bhi samaj gayi he jinke liye parivaar se pehle desh tha
 Lieutenant Ruchi says, "at first i certainly came into the army to fulfill my husband's dream, but when the star is placed on the shoulder, now i feel that the responsibility has increased
 uske baad, jab shapath lee to laga pehle maine bete or vineet ke liye fouj main aane ko sochaa tha par ab desh kii jimmedaari aan padi he, lakhon logon kii ummiden ham se jud gayi he or us par khara utarana har faujee kii tarah meraa bhi lakshya ban gaya he
 If a young nation like us does not think of this, then who will think? ' Father Sudhir is very proud to see the daughter's courage and bravery
 ruchi kahati he, uskaa betaa akshat bada hokar kya banegaa ye khud wo tay karegaa lekin agar wo fouj main jayega usase zyada khush koi or nahin hoga
 Ruchi says that ups and downs come and go in life, but life does not end there
 ye aapako tay karnaa hota he ki aapako vinar banakar jindagi gujaarni he yaa lujar banakar
 i did not want to live as a 'poor' so i chose this path
 agar aap kisi vajah se in top-5 naukariyon ke liye aavedan nahin kar paaen hai to aap abhi bhi in naukariyon ke liye aavedan kar sakate hai

 -what was the health of the girl being monitored through the concerned authorities? If yes, please provide his report
 -kya bacchee ko koi indiviual care plan diya gaya tha? uskaa vivaran den
 -how many children are available for adoption and how many children have been declared legally independent to adopt? Information about the date of adoption and its current status etc
 -vartmaan main CARA ke saath registerd prospective adoptive parents kii jaankaree, unke vartmaan rajya, umr, kya unki home study report puri ho gayi he, uski report, kya unako god lene ke liye sweekruti mil gayi he, kya unhone bachche ko god le liye he? ityadi kii jaankaree
 Details of Specialized Adoption Agency registered with CARA, monitoring arrangements for them to complete the process in a time bound manner for adoption, etc
 iske alaava ayog ne poocha he ki agar kisi maamle main baccha kisi aisi beemaari se jujh rahaa he, jisamen use turant parental care kii jarurat ho yaa kisi vishesh bachche ko jald god lene ke liye koi mata-pita aage aate hai to isaki prakriya saral banane ke liye CARA ne kya kadam uthaaye hai
 The Commission has asked CARA to provide the above information by 28 July

 ’ Actor Hrithik Roshan, who is following the footsteps of Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan in his new film Agneepath, says that this remake of the 1990 action thriller was his most challenging role ever
 varsh 2000 main 'kaho naa pyaar he' main mukhya bhoomika nibhaate hue film jagat main kadam rakhane vaale ruthik 'agnipath' main amitabh kaa 'vijay deenanath chouhan' kaa kirdaar nibhaate najar aaenge
 When Hrithik was asked if his image as an actor would be changed after 'agneepath', the 38-year-old actor said, 'it is not about my hand
 ham film ko safal banane ke liye vah sab kar rahe hai, jo ham kar sakate hai
 i do not believe in changing the image
 main keval pasandida filmein karata hum or kabhi nahin sochataa ki film meri chhavi badalegi yaa nahin
 He said, in terms of Agneepath, i think this is my most challenging role to date, especially the climax scene
 
 
 main iske bare main isse zyada nahin bataa saktaa
 
 
 The comments beete saal main ai ruthik kii film 'zindagi na milegi dobaaraa' kaaphi safal rahi thi
 However, this remake of 'agneepath' is being produced by Karan Johar, and he has given the responsibility of directing it to Karan Malhotra, while 'agneepath' was produced in the year 1990 by Karan Johar's father Yash Johar, and Mukul Anand gave it to him
 Had directed isi film ke liye amitabh bachchan ko sarvshereshth abhinayta kaa rashtriya puraskaar pehali baar mila tha
 Apart from Amitabh, Mithun Chakraborty, Madhavi, Rohini Hattangadi, Neelam, Danny Danzongpa, Tinu Anand and Vikram Gokhale played important roles in the 1990s 'agneepath', while Madhvi along with Hrithik replaced Amitabh in the remake of 'agneepath'
 Priyanka Chopra will be seen in place of, while Sanjay Dutt will be the villain in place of Danny
 is rimek main mithun chakravarti vaala krishnan ayyar kaa kirdaar gaayab kar diya gaya he, jabaki rouf lala kii bhoomika main rishi kapur ek nayaa kirdaar film main jodenge
 Hrithik, who stepped into the film industry in 2000, playing the lead role in 'kaho Naa Pyaar Hai', will be seen playing Amitabh's 'vijay Dinanath Chauhan' in 'agneepath'
 jab ruthik se poocha gaya, kya 'agnipath' ke baad abhinayta ke taur par unki chhavi badal paaegi, to 38-varshiya abhinayta ne kaha, yah mere haath kii baat nahin he
 We are doing all we can to make the film a success
 chhavi badalane main main bharosa nahin karata
 i only do favorite movies and never think if the film will change my image or not
 unhone kaha, agnipath ke maamle main, mujhe lagata he ki yah meri ab tak kii sarvaadhik chunauteepurn bhoomika vaali film he, khaskar clymex seen
 
 
 i cannot tell more than this
 
 
 tippaniyan Hrithik's film 'zindagi Na Milegi Dobara', which came in the last year, was very successful
 vaise 'agnipath' kaa yah rimek karan johar bana rahe hai, or unhone iske nirdesan kii jimmedaari karan malhotra ko saunpi he, jabaki varsh 1990 main ai 'agnipath' kaa nirmaan karan johar ke pita yash johar ne kiya tha, or mukul anand ne uskaa nirdesan kiya tha
 It was for this film that Amitabh Bachchan received the National Award for Best Actor for the first time
 varsh 1990 kii 'agnipath' main amitabh ke alaava mithun chakravarti, madhavi, rohinee hattangdi, neelam, danni denzongpa, tinu anand or vikram gokhale ne mahatvapurn bhoomikaayen nibhaai thim, jabaki 'agnipath' ke rimek main amitabh kii jagah lene vaale ruthik ke saath madhavi ke sthaan par priyanka chopra dikhaai dengi, jabaki danni ke sthaan par khalanaayak honge sanjay dutt
 In this remake, Mithun Chakraborty's character of Krishnan Iyer has been missing, while Rishi Kapoor as Rauf Lala will add a new character to the film

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will be in Allahabad on Friday, where he will once again resume the old tradition of honoring saints at the Magh Mela
 raja-rajwade ke vakt magh meley ke dauraan santon ko sammanit karne kii parampara thi, jise yogi phir se jeevant banaaenge
 But with this honor ceremony, international executive president of Vishwa Hindu Parishad Pravin Bhai Togadiyadur will remain
 viechpi ne to yahaan tak kah diya he ki is samaaroh main togadiya par naa to koi charchaa hogi, naa hi koi is bare main baat karegaa
 Even VHP has called Togadia an unfamiliar person
 darasal, vishwa hindu parishad kaa maardarshak mandal ye sant samagam yojit kar rahaa he, jisamen yogi aaenge or alag-alag akhaadon se jude santon ko sammanit karenge
 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad is organizing these programs, in which the Sant Samaj will also thank the Chief Minister Yogi for working on the agenda of religion, culture and nationalism
 ram mandir or ganga par hogi charchavishwa hindu parishad ke is kaarykram main ram mandir par charchaa to ho sakati he, lekin ramamandir par na to koi prastaav aayega or naa hi koi prastaav paas hoga
 There will be no proposal not only on the Ram temple but also on the cow and the Ganges
 aparichit hue togadiapurv grih rajya mantri or viechpi maardarshak mandal ke sadsy chinmayanand ne kaha togadiya kaa maamla vishwa hindu parishad kaa aantarik maamla he
 But Praveen Togadia has become an unfamiliar person to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 aise main togadiya par is kaarykram main charchaa tak nahin hogi
 In view of the manner in which Yogi Adityanath is advancing the agenda of saints in Uttar Pradesh, at present, Ram does not seem to be in a mood to ask the Ram temple or the sage government about Ganga
 ab sab nigahen farvari main shuru ho rahi ram mandir kii sunwaayee par tik gai he

 It is clear that Rahul Gandhi will take charge of the party in future
 congress pravaktaa janardan dvivedi ne ye to bataaya ki sonia ilaaj ke liye do-teen hafte tak videsh main hi rahengi
 So far, Rahul Gandhi, who is considered the crown prince of the Congress, has been given the command of the party, including three more leaders

 The message is going wrong by tug of war from cabinet members to within the party
 pehle do mantriyon satpal maharaj or harak singh ravat kaa cabinet kii baithak main mukhyamantri ke saamne hi bhid janaa surkhi bana, to phir haridwar main satpal maharaj or madan kowshik samarthakon ke bich hathapayee hui or meyar manoj garg ke aspataal pahunchane se sarkaar or bhaajapa kii kirakiri hui he
 There was already a heated market for discontent among ministers over the division of departments
 haalanki tab mantriyon kii nakhushi sataha tak nahin aa pai, lekin andarkhaane kuch ne apni naaraazgi prakat karne se gurej bhi nahin kiya
 After this, the leader and tourism minister Satpal Maharaj was absent from some cabinet meetings
 iskaa kaaran paryaton or tirthaton mantri hone ke baavjood chardhaam yatra ke liye bason kii ravaanagi ke samay unhen na bulaayaa janaa or unke virdohi chote bhai ko isamen bulaayaa janaa tha
 Apart from this, one of the reasons for his displeasure was the return of his helicopter leaving him there in a tour of the mountainous region
 isaki shikaayat unhone mukhyamantri se bhi kii thi
 After this, in the cabinet meeting of Maharaj and Forest Minister Harak Singh Rawat, there was a confrontation with each other in the matter of authority in Kedarnath
 maharaj jis praadhikaran ko mahatvapurn bataa rahe the harak singh ne uske kaamkaaj par ungliyaan uthaain
 The extent was reached when the supporters of Maharaja and Minister Madan Kaushik in Haridwar got lathi-poles
 rajnatik vishleshak ise mantriyon ke bich badhati duriyon ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 Due to all these incidents, the fear of furore in BJP has also started harassing the leaders
 chunaav se pehle congress main shaamil hue vijay bahuguna kii ajay bhatta se mulaakaat ne siyaasi atakalon par muhar laga di
 There is speculation that Bahuguna may also meet BJP President Amit Shah
 virdohi maanate hai ki bahuguna kii sakriyata bete kaa rajnatik kad badhaane keliye he
 Bahuguna, along with his son and MLA from Sitarganj, Saurabh Bahuguna, had reached Ajay Bhatt's residence and stayed there for half an hour
 iske baad bahuguna harak singh se bhi mili
 In this meeting, Bahuguna discussed the neglect of leaders from the Congress with the BJP
 haalanki bhatta ne isse inkaar kiya ki bahuguna apane putr ko mantri banavaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Harak Singh also denies resentment for being absent in a cabinet meeting
 unhone kotdwar ke hospital main kehane ke baavjood doctor na bhejne par naaraazgi jarur jataai
 Recently during a tricolor visit in Haridwar district, Haridwar MP Nishank and Khanpur in the district rebelled against the Congress and went to BJP and the case of fight between khanpur-turned-mla Kunwar Pranav champion supporters also as factionalism of BJP workers in the district being seen
 apane khilaaf exiar darj hone se champion naaraaz hai
 Along with him, Yatishwaranand, MLA from Haridwar Rural and Suresh Rathore, MLA from Jwalapur also met state president Ajay Bhatt in this matter
 pradesh adhyaksh ne in maamalon main mukhyamantri ke sankatmochan kii bhoomika nibhaate hue mukchaymantri se in vidhayakon ko apane saath le jaakar mulaakaat to karai hi kunwar pranav champion ko bhi mukhyamantri se milwakar unke khilaaf darj rapat kii babat jaankaree di or maamle ko shant karaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Ajay Bhatt said that there is no factionalism or dissent anywhere in the party
 haridwar main premanagar ashram par nagar nigam kii jameen or ek naale par atikaraman kaa aarope kuch sthaneey log lagaate rahe hai
 For this, the supporters of Maharaj present in Premnagar Ashram, armed with sticks and sticks, broke down on the supporters of the Mayor and City Development Minister Madan Kaushik with him
 patharav or lathi-danda chalane ke kaaran nagar meyar samet kai kaaryakarta chotil ho gaye
 Even after the confrontation between supporters, Ajay Bhatt reached Premnagar Ashram and talked to him in solitude
 bhatta ne donon mantriyon ke bich madhyasthata kii or maamle ko badaae se bachaaya
 Nonetheless, negative events are going on in the organization and public due to the incidents of tussle

 This is the third budget of the Kejriwal government, but even today Sonia is concerned about the safety of her daughters

 What it says History is recorded in the pages of history that in the 18th century, there was a violent struggle between Shaivite ascetics and Vaishnav Bairagis on the question of taking the first royal bath in the reign of Peshwas in Maharashtra
 peshwaon ne dashakon tak sinhasth kaashahee aayojanahi band kar diya tha
 Then the Peshwa rulers arranged the royal bath of the Vaishnava Vairagis at the Panchavati, the abode of Shiva and Lord Rama in the exile of Lord Rama after the settlement of the sage saints and Simhastha resumed with his dignity and glory

 i believe that there have been politicians on the rape of Jobchi, they are also rapists
 or ye rape par raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 'sheila Dixit can not be kejriwalsandipane, while backing Kejriwal said that he can never be Sheila Dixit
 shilajee ne vikaas kiya tha or kejariwal ne 9 maheene main kabada kiya he
 This is the reason for the resentment
 Actually, on the rape of the girls, Kejriwal said that she is not Sheila Dixit, who will be sitting hand in hand
 sandip ne is par kaha ki kejariwal dilli police maangate hai
 If they are given to the police, then in 3-4 years, they will do the condition of Delhi which the public will know
 is saal 24 janvari ko bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (isro) ne andhra pradesh ke sriharikota prakshepan centre se lagbhag 750 kilogram vajan kaa ek sainya upgrah microsat-aar kareeb 300 kilometre upar prithvi kii nichali kaksha main sthapit kiya tha
 ISRO did not provide any specific information about its purpose and detailed structural details
 uske baad se isro ke vaigyanik isaki pragati kii vaise hi nigaraanee kar rahe the jaise ve desh kii duusari antarikshawya sampattiyon kii karte hai
 However, the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) was also engaged in monitoring this satellite with a very different objective from these scientists
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 ke madhya main e-sat yaa upgrah-rodhi missile ke vikaas kii behad gopneey pariyojna ko manjuuri di thi
 DRDO President G
 On this project
 satish reddy ke netritv main vaigyanikon kaa ek dal kaam par laga tha
 Prior to launch, only information about the project was shared as needed
 varisht missile visheshgy reddy ko aisi missile ke vikaas kii chunautiyon kii jaankaree thi
 He was in that team of India's ballistic missile defense (BMD) system
 is team ne beete 15 varshon main antariksh main bahut tej gati se gum rahi vastuon, khaas taur par mixilon, ke dhundgaye or bharat ke kisi hisse par prahaar karne ke pehle unhen maar giraane kii kshamtaaon ke vikaas kaa aadhaar pradaan kiya he
 Destroying a satellite in space is more complex than shooting down a missile
 koi upgrah antariksh main kareeb saat kilometre prati second kii behad tej gati se ghumta he or use nasht karne ke liye prithvi kii sataha se 300 kilometre yaa usase adhik oonchai par us par prahaar karnaa hota he, jabaki biemdi pranali adhiktam 100 kilometre prati second kii gati se gum rahi missile par waar karne ke liye dizin kii gai thi
 The most important thing was to acquire the precise capability to hit the target satellite, called the kinetic kill
 kisi upgrah ko niskriy karne ke liye us par kiye jane vaale prahaar main adhik se adhik paanch centimetre kii ashuddhi seemaa sambhav he—matlab aapaki hatheli kii chaudaai se bhi kam
 All of this means creating a three-stage special missile combination that has two stage boosters to take the vehicle to that distance
 iske alaava ek 'maarak-yaan' bhi viksit kiya janaa tha jisamen do 'dietwart prakshepak' lage hon jinase ise icchaanusaar ghumaya-phiraaya ja sake
 Aiming to find targets with imaging infra-red (IIR), the probe can find its target satellite and strike it with a needle's tip
 reddy ke diardio kaa pramukh banane ke baad pichley chah maheene main e-sat par kaam kii gati badi thi
 On 25 March, Reddy made ISRO chief
 shivan ko phone kiya or unhen kaha ki ve microsat-aar kii nigaraanee kar rahe vaigyanikon ko bataa den ki diardio agle do dinon main odisha ke whealer island par sthit prakshepan centre se e-sat missile chhod kar use nasht karne ja rahaa he
 Just 20 days earlier, the DRDO had urged the Airports Authority of India to issue a "notice to Airmen (NOTAM)" for March 27 warning all air operations to stay away from the sky surrounding the launch center
 iske baad diardio ke vaigyanikon ne 14 meter lambii missile ko prakshepan centre par jodpha chaalu kiya or uske sabhi ahm pareekshan kiye
 These scientists had to work overnight for the final investigation to ensure there were no hindrances at the last minute
 is bich, diardio ke lambii duuri ke khoji radar lakshith upgrah par najar rakh rahe the
 The idea was to strike the satellite when it is in its orbit, just above the launch center in the Bay of Bengal
 missile prakshepan ke liye 27 march ko din main 11
 a time was set for 10 o'clock
 bilkul thik vakt par e-sat missile baari garjana ke saath akaash main upar kii ore bad chali
 In the next 60 seconds he had reached 40 km altitude in space when his first stage booster rocket broke away from him
 iske ek minute baad yah 100 kilometre kii oonchai tak pahunch chuki thi jab duusare charan ke rocket ne 'maarak yaan' ko aise path par daal diya jis par aage badhate hue vah apane lakshya upgrah ko dhund kar use maar gira saktaa tha
 After this, the heartbeat of the scientists remained as if stuck for 90 seconds
 vaigyanikon ko tab raahat mili, jab pushti ho gai ki missile ne sateek nishaanaa saadhaa or lakshith upgrah nasht ho chukaa he
 Reddy followed this with 11
 20 minute par rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ko phone par is safalataa kii soochna di
 Doval gave this information to the Prime Minister
 kuch hi der baad modi ne twit karke janata ko sandesh diya ki vah dopaher paune 12 baje se 12 baje ke bich kuch ahm sandesh dene ja rahe hai
 The whole country was waiting for breath when 12 noon
 35 baje utsahit lag rahe modi ne rashtriya televijan par ghoshnaa kii ki america, rus or china ke baad bharat aisa chauthaa desh ban gaya he jo upgrah-rodhi shastr pranaaliyon ke vikaas main sakasham he
 Congratulating the scientists, Modi said, "while a thrust A-SAT missile will strengthen India's technology and security system, i assure the international community that India's defense initiative is only for its security
" ham antariksh main hathiyaaron kii hode ke viruddh hai
 "soon after, a political storm arose whether Modi should have made this announcement in this manner and just before the first phase of elections
 phir bhi pradhanmantri ko iskaa credit lene kaa puraa adhikaar he
 However, Bharatiya Janata Party spokespersons were indicating that the UPA governments of the past had not shown the vision and courage necessary for the development of A-SAT
 aisa kehane se bachaa ja saktaa tha
 a scientist pointed out that the BMD system approved and developed during the UPA regime was the first phase of A-SAT
 is bich videsh mantralay ne baar-baar puche jane vaale prashnon kii ek suchi jari karte hue spasht kiya ki is pareekshan se antariksh main koi kachra nahin paidaa hua he
 This satellite was in the lower story of the earth and its pieces will fall on the earth in the next few weeks without causing any damage
 spashtikaran main doharaaya gaya ki yah pareekshan desh kii antariksh sampattiyon, khaas taur par sainya uddeshyon se jasusi, ke bachaav or suraksha ke liye kiya gaya tha na ki star vars jaise kisi kaarykram kii shuruyaat ke liye
 The clarification also added that India hopes in the future to "develop a draft international law to stop arms race in outer space", including keeping arms in outer space on behalf of countries traveling in space
 Will play the role udhar odisha main prakshepan sthal par reddy or unka dal khushi se uchhal rahe the
 Reddy told India Today that it is a great technological achievement for the country
 is missile ko desh main hi viksit kiya gaya tha or hamane bahut oonche darje kii sateek kshamta hasil kii jisaki koshish hamane pehle nahin kii thi
 This is a sign of our significant advancement in this specific technology
 jo baat kahi nahin gai vah yah he ki bhale hi is pareekshan main lakshya 300 kilometre duuri par tha, par bharat ke paas ab isse bhi zyada duuri par sthit videshi antariksh sampattiyon par nishaanaa saadhane kii kshamta he
 The BMD system of the country has also been upgraded and enemy missiles can be targeted over long distances if needed
 jaahir he, suraksha or takneekee drushti se yah ek ahm padaav he

 While the Defense Minister has sought a report from Naval Chief Admiral Sunil Lanba regarding this, the Navy has also sought information about the leak from DCNS

 Now that the leaking of important information related to the submarine is being revealed, what will happen to the remaining submarines? If this information is lost to enemy countries like China and Pakistan, then what will happen to our security preparedness is a big question

 (input bhashaa se) Nirmala Sitharaman has emphasized that there is no slowdown in the economy
 Many people are considering the decline in the economy as economic slowdown
 Analyzing the GDP figures revealed many surprising things
 The analysis of the data reinforced the apprehension that the country may be recession Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has reached the stage in the Parliament has emphasized that there is no slowdown in the Indian economy Is not, despite the continuing debate on this
 ise aarthik susti bataaya ja rahaa he, lekin jidipi ke aankadon kaa vishleshan karen to is baat kii ashanka majboot ho rahi he ki desh vastav main mandi ke daur main pahunch chukaa he
 The main reason for this is that the National Statistics Office (NSO) uses organized sector data to measure growth in the unorganized sector and it is assumed that both sectors are growing at the same rate
 aapako yaad dilaa den ki enesao data se pataa chalata he ki timahi jidipi lagaataar chah timahiyon se gir rahi he
 8 of the fourth quarter of FY 2018
 1 fisadi se vitt varsh 2020 kii antim timahi main yah 4
 5 percent
 timahi jeedpi kaa kis tarah se akalan kiya jaataa haivitt varsh 2019 kii duusari timahi ke jidipi growth ke aankade jari karte hue enesao ne jo ghoshnaa kii usko dekhakar yah andaja lagata he ki in aankadon kaa strot kya he
 Agricultural sector data is taken from states for quarterly estimates, but for non-agricultural sectors like industry and services, the following data are used in it- A
 arddh corporate yaa asangathit segment kii menuphaccharing ke liye aiipi menuphaccharing data kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 B
 vittiya, real estate or profeshnal sevaaon ke liye corporate sector or banking data kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 C
 vyapaar, hotel, transport, sanchaar or prasaaran ke liye jiesti or cells tex ke aankadon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 D
 bijli , gas, jal aapurti or anya utility sevaaon ke liye aiipi electricity kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 E
 nirmaan aadi ke liye cement utpaadan or taiyaar steel kii khapat ke aankade liye jate hai
 So it is quite clear that the organized sector is the source of data for all
 to jidipi ke timahi aankade puri tarah se sahi tabhi honge, jab sangathit or sangathit, donon sector samaan dar se aage bad rahe hon
 In fact, Pranab Sen (economist and statistician) changed the base of GDP as chairman of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) in 2011-12 and came to the post after him
 si
 Mohanan confirmed that the quarterly estimates include the growth rate of the organized sector for data on the unorganized sector
 lekin donon yadi samaan dar se na bad rahe hon to isse gumraah karne vaali tasviir saamne aati he or isamen kitni galati hoti he, yah jidipi main sangathit kshetra ke aakaar or hissedari par nirbhar karegaa
 There is no official information about how large the share of unorganized sector is in GDP
 What does NSC do to estimate quarterly GDP? saal 2012 main enessi ke asangathit kshetra sankhyikee par gathit kamity kii report main kaha gaya he ki: ‘kamgaaron kaa 90 fisadi hissaa or (GDP) rashtriya utpaada kaa kareeb 50 fisadi hissaa anaupchaarik arthvyavastha ke dwaara aanka jaataa he
 According to an official report of the earlier National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganized Sector (NCEUS), the ratio of unorganized sector and GVA to 55 in 1999–2000
 24 fisadi or 2004-05 main 49
 9 percent
 yahi nahin, 4 july, 2019 ko jari saal 2018-19 ke iconomic survey main kaha gaya he, ‘kul kamgaaron kaa kareeb 93 fisadi hissaa ‘anaupchaarik kaarybal’ kaa he
 Sen says that the contribution of the unorganized sector during the 2011-12 change of GDP series was assumed to be 47 per cent
 is prakaar, yah maananaa surakshit ho saktaa he ki asangathit kshetra kaa jidipi main yogadan kareeb 50 fisadi he
 This means that if the two sectors do not grow at the same rate, then the quarterly GDP estimate could be marginally different
 kya sangathit or asangathit sector main badhat samaan dar se ho rahi he?is bare main abhi koi aadhikarik data nahin he jisase yah pataa chale ki asangathit kshetra par notebandi yaa jiesti kaa kya asar rahaa he, lekin is baat main koi vivaad nahin ho saktaa he ki in donon ghatnaon kaa hamaari arthvyavastha par kaaphi nakaaratmak asar rahaa he
 Sen says that these incidents have had more impact on the unorganized sector than the organized sector, the most impact has been on demonetisation and GST has been slightly less affected
 yah maanate hue ki in donon ghatnaon se asangathit kshetra ke badhat main kami ai he, unhone kaha: ‘saal 2017-18 se ab tak jidipi anumaan ko badha-chadhaakar dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 They present a rough calculation of what the GDP estimates are of the different rates of growth of the unorganized and unorganized sector
 vah kehete hai ki jidipi main jo asangathit kshetra kaa 47 fisadi kaa yogadan he (saal 2011-12 ke jidipi siries ko antim rup dene ke samay anumaanit), usamen krishi kaa hissaa 17 fisadi, vyapaar kaa 9 fisadi or menuphaccharing evam sarvice sector kaa hissaa 21 fisadi ke kareeb he
 The data related to agriculture is taken by the central government from the states, while trade data is obtained from GST
 lekin menuphaccharing or services jaise 21 fisadi asangathit kshetra ke vaastavik aankade nahin mil pate
 They say that this 21% share is not actually measured during the quarterly figures of GDP
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen is bare main koi idia nahin he ki jidipi ke is 21 fisadi hisse kaa kya kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, the quarterly GDP figures are 'much worse', because even the organized sector figures are not available on a quarterly basis
 haalanki, arthshaastri professor arun kumaar kii raay thodi alag he
 He says transporters, businessmen and manufacturing organizations are claiming a 15 per cent drop in their business due to the continuous 'three economic setbacks' - demonetisation, GST and non-banking financial companies (nbfcs) crisis
 khabaron ke anusaar is tyohaari sijan (dashahra or diwali) ke dauraan main bhi kaarobaar bahut utsahjanak nahin rahaa
 Consumer durables and retail sales grew 15-20 per cent this time, compared to 27 per cent growth in the previous year
 is bare aid par hone vaale kharch main sirf 8 se 9 fisadi kii badhat hui, jabaki pichley saal isamen 13 se 14 fisadi kii badhat hui thi
 Even if the business of the unorganized sector is to decline by 10 per cent, according to Professor Kumar, this means that the growth of the unorganized sector is minus 3
 1 fisadi (-3
 1%), ie it has declined
 isamen yah hisaab lagaaya gaya he ki jidipi main asangathit kshetra kaa hissaa 45 fisadi he, jisamen se krishi kshetra kaa hissaa 14 fisadi he or gaiyr krishi kshetra kaa hissaa 31 fisadi he
 GDP growth in minus! Now, given that quarterly 4 in the organized sector (whose share can be considered 55%)
 5 fisadi kii badhat ho rahi he, yah mana ja saktaa he ki timahi jidipi growth main iskaa yogadan mahaj 2
 4 percent
 to asangathit kshetra ke negative 3
 Subtracting 1 percent growth from this, it seems that the quarterly GDP growth is minus 0
 4 fisadi (-0
 4%)
 professor kumaar jor dekar kehete hai, ‘is tarah ham mandi ke daur main pahunch gaye hai
 (agriculture's share in GDP in the year 2018-19 is 14)
 38%, menuphaccharing 18
 04%, 23 of the entire industry
 13% or sevaayen 62
 5%) Professor Kumar has also estimated that the business of the unorganized sector is not assessed or even much lower than the GST collection
 isaki vajah he: (a) jinka kul salanaa turnover 40 lakh se kam hota he unako isse chhot he (b) jinka turnover 40 lakh se 1
 Up to Rs 5 crore, they are exempted from paying just 1 per cent tax under the Composite Scheme and (c) according to former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, 95 per cent tax comes from just 4 lakh taxpayers (3%)
 is saal kii shuruyaat tak enessi ke chairman rahe mohanan kehete hai: ‘meraa maananaa yah he ki sirf kuch maamalon ko chhodkar timahi jidipi kabhi bhi vaastavik data par aadhaarit nahin hota
 a good example of this clearly visible mismatch is how the last quarter GDP grew after demonetisation, while everyone knows that the economy was not in good shape
 is tarah timahi jidipi kii gunvattta kii apni simaaen hoti hai
 So if the quarterly GDP figures are misleading, then there may be other economic indicators related to it, which are used to show that there has not been a slowdown like per capita GDP (production or product), per Individual gross and net national income (GNI and NNI), private consumption (PFCE) and capital formation (GFCF)
 iske alaava bhi kai chintajanak aankade hai
 The number of workers is decreasing
 The Periodic Labor Force Survey (PLFS) of 2017-18 shows that not only the unemployment rate is at a 45-year high of 6
 1 fisadi par he, balki isse bhi bada sankat desh main banataa dikh rahaa he
 This shows that the labor force participation rate (LFPR-15 years or older people who are either working or looking for work) 55 of 2011-12
 9% se ghatakar saal 2017-18 main 49
 8% and is the first decline in the country
 LFPR main giravat kaa matlab yah he ki kaam na milane kii vajah se log shrambal se baahar ja rahe hai
 Analyzing PLFS 2017-18 in a study conducted by Azim Premji University, it said that for the first time in Indian history, 9 million jobs were lost between 2011-12 and 2017-18
 yah baat dhyaan main rakhni chahie ki saal 2017-18 main bharat kii salanaa growth rate 7
 2 per cent and now this growth rate has come down to 4
 5 fisadi rah gai he
 This means that the condition of unemployment can become worse and so is the financial health of a large population, especially in rural areas
 pehali baar garibi badhati dikh rahi haisaal 2017-18 ke enesao ke upabhokta vyay survey (CES) ko sarkaar ne haal main koodaydaan main daal diya he, isaki data kii gunvattta par sawaal uthaate hue
 Actually its report was leaked in which the picture looked very bad
 is li hui report se yah pataa chalata he ki ‘vaastavik’ (mahangaai se samyojit) prati parivaar upabhokta vyay main pichley 40 saal main pehali baar 3
 There has been a decline of 7 percent
 yah saal 2011-12 ke 1501 rupee se ghatakar saal 2017-18 main 1,446 fisadi rah gai
 At that time also it has to be kept in mind that India's annual GDP growth is 7
 2 fisadi thi
 4 of course
 5 fisadi kii growth rate par halaat or badtar honge
 So this is the point on which Professor Kumar strengthens his argument that India has now reached a period of recession
 ho saktaa he ki aisa na bhi ho, lekin aadhikarik aankadon ke abhaav main mandi par bahes nirarthak hi he
 It would be suicidal to ignore the early signs and limitations of GDP estimation

 At present, criminal and sexual abuse cases against children in the country are increasing continuously
 aparaadh main 13
 An increase of 6% has led to an increase in criminal activity on children across the country, if you look at the last crime-based report released in 2016 by the International Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)
 2014 main bacchon ke saath aparaadh kii 89,423 ghatnaayen darj huin

 desh ke 14 rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon main bal yon shoshan ke ek hajaar se zyada maamle darj kiye gaye
 Till recently, many cases like Kathua and Unnao rape cases were very much discussed, but the rate of child sexual exploitation (registered under the POCSO Act) in the long time terror-affected state of Jammu and Kashmir is much lower than other states and this This state can thus be considered safe for children
 enciarabi 2016 kii report kahati he ki is rajya main 2016 main mahaj 25 bal yon shoshan ke maamle darj kiye gaye

 However, officials associated with the NCRB say that the finalization of the 2017 report is delayed due to West Bengal and Bihar not submitting their respective states' reports

 unhone kaha, 'supreme court ke aadesh or unke vakeelon kii ore se daayar anya halafnaamon ke aadhaar par hamane sabhi chaar logon ko reeha kar diya he
 ' isse pehle supreme court ne kal apane aadesh main akshardham hamale ke sabhi chah aropiyon ko bari karte hue kaha tha, 'abhiyojan kii kahani har str par tuutati najar aati he
 30 people were killed in the 24 September 2002 attack on this temple located in Gandhinagar
 is maamle main kal supreme court ne jin chah logon ko bari kiya he unke naam hai-altaaf malik, abdulmiyaan kadri, aadam ajmeri, mohammad hanif shaikh, abdul kayum or chand khan urf shaan miyaan

 ' in chaaron main se aadam ajmeri, abdul kayum or chand khan urf shaan miyaan ko sthaneey adaalat ne maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 Mohammad Hanif Sheikh was sentenced to life imprisonment till death
 vartika nanda mediakarmi or shikshak ke alaava samvedansheel kavyitri bhi hai
 The social anomalies of today's era continue to haunt him
 ve krime reporting bhi kar chuki hai
 These facts are mentioned because you will find all these shades of his personality in his new book Tinka Tinka Dasna
 yah kitaab asal main ek dilachasp silsile kii duusari kadi he
 He closely watched the life inside Dasna jail, the second most talked about country after Tihar
 itnaa hi nahin, sajayaftaa kaidiyon se unhone kavitaayen likhwain, painting banavaai or khud ek gaanaa likhakar kaidiyon se gavaaya jo ab jail kaa parichay gaan ho gaya he or roj subah-shaam vahaan gaaya jaataa he
 They are now ready to take Tinka Tinka to Agra and then to a jail in Gujarat
 khayr, dasna jail ke umrakaidiyon main se jin paanch ke badalte jivan kii jhalak kitaab main he, unamem aarushi hatyakand ke abhiyukt talwaar dampati (rajesh-noopur) or nithari cond kaa abhiyukt surinder coli bhi he
 Apart from these, there is also a singing troupe of life-long prisoners and Vivek, a painter whose talent flourished there
 pustak ke inhen se jude ansh ham yahaan de rahe havegel main talwararushi ames main padhuya chaahati thi
 She wanted to be a doctor
 noopur or rajesh ke jitne bhi saathi the, un sabake bachche yaa to ab dentist ban chuke hai yaa phir banane vaale hai
 When Rajesh became ill a few days ago, he was taken to AIIMS
 puure raste or phir vahaan jaakar ve is soch kii chubhan se ubar nahin paae ki yahi vah jagah he jahaan aaj aarushi shaayad medicine pard rahi hoti
 She would be preparing to become a doctor
 lekin samay aisa palata ki ve aaj yahaan ek aaropee ke taur par baithe hai
 But when is it reversed by telling the time
 donon kii jindagi ab vah nahin he
 Everything has changed
 haa, ek cheez ab rajesh nahin karte
 They do not look outside
 
 
 yahaan aane ke baad maheenon ve baahar ke daravaaje kii taraf is aas se dekhte the ki sibiai kii team aegi or kahegi ki doctor sahab, ham se galati ho gai
 Now it is proved that both of you are innocent
 hafte main ek baar rajesh ke bhai aate hai
 They are eye doctors
 ve har hakrate yahaan par bandiyon kii ankhon kii jaanch kaa muft camp lagaate hai
 Rajesh's sister-in-law Vandana also keeps in touch and the amount of time he has left after his medical profession, stays for Rajesh and Nupur
 
 
 vandana ko kachotata he ki logon ko yah kahaan yaad ki sarkaar ne bhi media ke ek hisse ko gaiyr-jimmedaarana mana tha
 People probably only remember what they were served
 tasveeron se judi yaaddaasht kab or kaise mitegi, isaki chubhan unhen chaiyn nahin lene detii
 The Talwar film comes but Rajesh and Nupur keep avoiding seeing her
 filmon main jele bhale hi dikhaai jaati hon lekin jail main filmon kii maujuudagi aaj bhi hakeekat nahin he
 Therefore, when will the sword itself see the sword made on its own, who knows
 rajesh kii ankhen bhigi hai
 Nupur is looking down
 rajesh kah rahe hai ki hamaare sabhi saathi bahut aage nikal gaye or ham jahaan the, vahaan se bahut peeche aa gaye
 Don't know when they will be out and how the society will accept them whenever they are
 jail kii hadein sab baaten kahaan tay kar paati hai
 The dentist's studies that he did, would one day become his biggest support inside the jail, he did not even have ilm
 roj donon kaa kuch samay padhgaye main bitta tha
 These days Nupur is reading All the Light that We Can't See
 rajesh ne unase kaha tha ki ve ise padhein
 She wants to write an autobiography but the heart and mind are unable to talk among themselves
 itani paraten udhdgaye lagati hai ki shabd bhigane lagate hai, kaagaj pigal jaataa he
 When i talk, sometimes Rajesh says something, sometimes Nupur
 main sawaal nahin karti
 i speak less
 main sirf aakhen uthaa kar dekhati hum or har baar paati hum ki donon ek duusare ke shabdon ke poorak banate chalate hai
 When Rajesh's voice starts to sink, Nupur completes those sentences and when Nupur does not have the courage, Rajesh comes to speak
 jail ne in donon ko pehle se bhi zyada kareeb laa diya he
 The two are each other's companions, classmates, human beings, lovers
 jail ke jis bhi bandi se baat hui, usne yahi kaha ki kisi ne kabhi bhi in donon ko aapas main jhagadate, yahaan tak ki ruuthate tak nahin dekha
 Both of their breaths are interlinked
 kamaal kii taratamyata
 Both are in the same prison but do not meet daily
 jail ke apane kaayade hai, isliye duuri he
 But despite the distance there is mutual respect, intimacy
 ek din main jail main gai to maine bandiyon ko rajesh ke liye chintit paaya
 He had a high fever for three days
 rajesh se kahin zyada ve bandi mujhe vichlit dikhe
 
 
 On another day, Rajesh Talwar was very ill
 jail main unhen drip lagi thi
 Nupur was nervous to see them, but she did not want to express that discomfort
 kuch kadamon kii hi duuri par band apane pati ko na mil paane kii takalif saaf dikh rahi thi
 That day he saw Rajesh coming out of the hospital on CCTV and she kept quiet
 is duniya ko unhone apana liya he
 With silence
 yahaan sabake paas apana koi dukh he or dukh hi kaa naata he
 Everyone is on some journey
 kis kaa safar kab khatm hoga, koi nahin jaanata
 Jail teaches to live in today
 ummid ke fate pahalu bhi detii he
 The Talwar couple has taken them to jail and the jail has adopted them
 vah media raat bhar kii tuutati-karaahati neend ke bich dikhataa he jisane adaalat kii pehali sunwaayee se pehle hi unhen darinda or kaatil qaraar de diya tha
 They believe that the divine hearing is yet to be held
 unhen ummid he ki vah faisla jab hoga, tab aarushi shaayad vahiin kahin hogi
 This 24th May was his 21st anniversary
 jail kii barrack main ittfa se us din vahi gaanaa chal rahaa tha jise aarushi har roj padhai ke dauraan 10 minute kaa brake lete hue puure jor se spikar par sunati thi—pehali najar main kaisaa jaadu kar diya, tera ban baitha he meraa jiya, jane kya hoga, kya hoga kya pataa, is pal ko milke, aa ji le jaraa
 i have finally asked while walking - if you ever feel like eating something you like? Jail does not run by choice
 ***surinder colih ab kanoon kaa visheshjaiyah he surinder coli
 The Nithari incident is an introduction to this
 faansee kii sajaa hui par filmi style main faansee hote-hote tal gai
 a few days before the sentencing, he was sent to Meerut jail as the hanging house is there
 sajaa kii ek raat pehle meerut or gajiabad kii jail ke aalaa adhikari jaagate rahe kyonki ain vakt par uski sajaa ko multavee karne kaa aadesh aayaa tha
 Punishment averted
 coli ko waapas gajiabad laayaa gaya
 The Koli who returned this time was more confident than ever
 coli ko jail ne badla
 Nearly illiterate Koli's early days in prison were of a dilemma
 use kanoonee bhashaa samaj main nahin aati thi
 Nor technology
 uske do vakil is cese ko mil rahi media kii raushnee main gulzaar the
 Koli was in the dark in that
 coli ne kaid main padhuya-likhnaa siikhaa
 
 
 For the first few days, it was closed here with its owner Pandher
 tab maamalon ko samajhane ke liye pandher kaa yahi naukar coli usase angreji padhgaye laga
 After some time Pandher was released
 ab rah gaya akelaa coli
 But Koli did not lose
 usne jail se kaagaj liye, jail se hi kalam lee, nai-puraani kitabon kaa dher lagaaya or kaale aksharon se jujhane laga
 First he learned Hindi and Urdu
 sakshar hone kii aisi talleenta ab tak dasna ke kisi bhi bandi main nahin dekhi gai
 To save his life, Koli hugged books and papers near his bed and began to drown
 akshar uskaa olyuya-bichhauna ho gaye
 Today, Koli is the master of the language of law
 kanoonee pechidgiyaan, uski bhashaa or uskaa dharra use bharpoor samaj main aa gaya he
 He is an RTI expert
 apni jaan bachaane ke liye usne aisi-aisi artiai lagaai hai ki koi bhi hairat main pad jaae
 An RTI also suggested that the drain in which the dead bodies of the children were found was cleaned last time
 sarkari tayshuda jawaab main se apane kaam ke myne nikaalane main coli kaa koi jawaab nahin
 i wanted to know from Koli - how he wastes time in jail
 uskaa jawaab tha—vah sara din apane cese se jude dastavej, kitaaben or daleelein padhata he
 He is very busy
 uske paas barbaad karne kaa samay nahin
 i said if you would give any of your poetry for the book, its answer was that it is not poetry, but only the law
 phir vah rone laga
 Cried for the first time in his stay in prison
 jail ke adhikari bataate hai ki vah kabhi biimaar nahin hua
 Never cried avsaad main ghirne ke bajaae vah filon main ghire rahanaa behatar samajhataa he or pakke taur par maanata he ki uskaa bachaav agar koi kar saktaa he to vah khud
 No one comes to meet her at her home
 kisi kii koi khabar uske paas nahin or ab kisi par bharosa bhi nahin
 He knows what has been written about him in the media
 lekin ab use kisi baat se fark nahin padataa
 The jail has made Koli a rock in the face of the situation
 apane aparaadh kii baat vah nahin karata
 He talks of rescue
 apni har sunwaayee se pehle vah khud se jirah karata he
 Question to myself khud hi se jawaab
 He becomes a judge himself, police himself
 jail ne use kanoon kii un galiyon se parichit karvaa diya he jo uske liye anjaan thim
 The biggest thing - today he is literate
 ***ek rangarej, rang kar chalaa gaya32 saal kaa vivek vishakhapatnam kaa rahane vaala he
 Vivek told Shivaji Yadav (deputy jailer) during his 8-month stay here that he is fond of painting
 
 
 kuch hi dinon main vivek ne jo banaaya, usne sabhi ko chaunkaa diya
 He made a road in a wall and trees on both sides
 painting puri tarah se 3-di ke concept par banaai gai—kuch is andaaj main ki jab bhi painting kii taraf dekha jaataa he to lagata he ki jaise jail kii diwaar par sachmuch kii hi ek sadak bana di gai he
 
 
 When i met Vivek for the first time, he told that sometime back when he came to Delhi from Visakhapatnam to meet his brother, he had seen a mural painting on the lines of Tinka Tinka Tihar outside Tihar Jail and he had a similar desire
 Had to paint with his style on the big wall
 tab use kya pataa tha ki agali baar jab vah vishakhapatnam se gajiabad aayega to halaat use jail main le aaenge
 i asked Vivek to make a 3-D painting of Tinka Tinka Dasna on one wall of Dasna jail
 jail ke aalaa adhikariyon ne vivek ke kehane par sabhi rang mangava die, nae brush or seedhi bhi
 
 
 This wall of Tinka Tinka Dasna was prepared after four months of hard work
 vivek vichaaradhin bandi tha
 The day the last brush on the wall came, Vivek's release arrived
 maano yah diwaar banane hi yahaan aayaa ho
 While in jail, the prison became a studio
 ab khulaa akaash uskaa studio hoga
 *** There are a total of 9 people in Sargamandali in bars
 sab suron ke jaankaar
 a harmonium, a tabla, a dholak
 majira bhi he yahaan par
 It is a prison singing troupe
 roj subah jab ye milte hai to pehle yah poochhate hai ki kiske cese kaa kya hua
 
 
 (then) the Mahfil moves on
 
 
 jo nae log aate hai, unase bhi pehla parichay yaheen se shuru hota he
 
 
 The congregation is a light for the entire prison
 aashaaram giri ko puraa jail dewan ji kahata he
 Railway Police Force jawan Asharam was sentenced to life imprisonment under Section 302 for killing in 2008 after mutual enmity in the village
 isi saal unhone yah bhajan mandali banaai
 The village had three young sons and the situation at home was not good
 man buja rahata tha
 Then the songs became Sahara
 ek din tatkaaleen jailer raamji singh jail ke nirikshan par the to paaya ki

 hormonium bajaane ke liye brijmohan sharma mili jo dahej hatya ke maamle main dhara 304 ke tahat band the
 
 
 Yogesh Kumar was found for Dholak who was under life imprisonment under section 302
 dhara 420 ke tahat bandi dinesh chimata bajaane main maahir tha
 
 
 He also got a Bhajan singer and poet like Dharmaveer
 bulandshahr kaa rahane vaala dharmaveer dhara 302 ke tahat aaajeevan karawas par tha
 Today she is the life of this group
 ek din dharmaveer kii mulaakaat ek bandi kuldeep se hui
 Hearing his painful love story, Ragini's lines came out of Dharmaveer's heart, which he prepared with the groomsmen
 jab use bandiyon ko sunaaya gaya to uski maang aane lagi
 Now it is alam
 
 
 vah khub likhata he or khub gaata he
 This congregation tells me that singing very depressed detainees gets a therapy
 ham ek parivaar hai
 
 
 When a captive does not eat food any day, we all feed him together
 hamen yah bhi pataa rahata he ki nasha karte rahe nae aae kis bandi ko vidrol simptom ho rahaa he
 We also comfort him
 sangeet kii yah mehfil kisi dharm se koi sarokaar nahin rakhti

 This is why at the launch of the Super 30 trailer, many fans demanded that Pankaj Tripathi should play the role of Anand Kumar in place of Hrithik Roshan in this film, because his stature and background is very similar to Anand Kumar
 Hai and Pankaj Tripathi may prove to be better than Hrithik to give the film a realistic touch
 lekin ye bhi sach he ki ruthik ke staradam kii pankaj treepathi ke staradam se tulana nahin kii ja sakati he or nishchit taur par ruthik roshan apane staradam ke chalate is mahatvapurn film ko zyada se zyada logon tak pahunchane main kaamyaab ho paae hai

 After the resignation of Rahul Gandhi, the Congress is once again in the hands of Sonia Gandhi
 unki sabase badi pariksha haryana main party netaaon ko ek saath sadhakar rakhane kii he
 Time and politics have brought Sonia Gandhi to such a place that she faces the challenge of reviving the party again
 bees saal pehle 1998 main congress ke star prachaarak ke taur par unhone haryana ke rohtak se ek raily ko sambodhit kar apane siyaasi safar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 On 18 August, former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda is going to rally in the same Rohtak to challenge the party high command
 bataa den ki sonia gandhi ne 2005 main haryana main apane varisht netaa bhajanlaal ke bajaay bhupendra singh hooda ko tarjeeh di thi
 As a result of this, Bhajanlal formed his own party by saying goodbye to the Congress
 jabaki hooda das saal tak haryana ke mukhyamantri rahe
 Now before the assembly elections, Hooda is going to rally Parivartan in Rohtak to make the party high command realize his political power
 congress ke sheersh netritv ko bina bataaya hooda kii ore se rohtak main raily kaa aayojan kiye jane se kai tarah ke sawaal khadey ho rahe hai

 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki is raily main bhupendra singh hooda congress se naata todakar alag apni party banane kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, it is also being said that they have an exercise to create a bargain before the assembly elections
 haalanki ek daur main sonia gandhi ne haryana ke diggaj netaa bhajanlaal ko darkinar kar hooda ko tarjeeh di thi
 The relationship with Sonia soured when in 2016, Hooda refused to support Congress Rajya Sabha candidate RK Anand
 iskaa nateeja rahaa ki aarake anand haar gaye or nirdaleey pratyaashee ke taur par subhash chandra jitkar rajyasabha pahunch gaye
 There is uproar in the Congress
 haryana main congress guton main bati hui he
 The battle for political supremacy between Hooda and state president Ashok Tanwar is not hidden from anyone
 bhupendra singh hooda raily ke jariye ek baar phir chunauti pesh kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is to be seen how Sonia Gandhi and her team overcome Hooda's rage
 isse yah bhi pataa chalegaa ki sonia apni duusari pari main saudebaaji karne waalon ke saath kis tarah nipatati hai
 Will she let them go or keep them with her

 baraat tay vakt par pahunch chuki thi
 The reception of the wedding processions was loud
 bas ab baaki kii thodi-bahut rasm bachi thi
 Then the bride would become the groom forever
 magar aisa ho paata ain usee vakt ek or dulhan baraat main pahunch jaati he
 Then what was the whole scene changes
 phirajab shehanai kaa shor thamata he tab pataa chalata he ki kissa duulhaa 420 kaa he
 Actually, this is the story of a luxurious hotel in Hazratganj area of lucknow, where the surprise entry of Eklarki made everyone silent before a wedding
 ab lakhanu se qareeb saadhe teen sau kilometre dur pashchimi uttar pradesh ke muradabad main liye chalate hai
 Where it is more or less the same picture
 yahaan bhi shaadi kii tamaam taiyaariyaan puri ho chuki he
 Relatives and all guests have come to congratulate us
 balki yahaan to saje-dhaje duulhe raja baratiyon ke saath apane honevaale sasuraal main pehle hi maujuud hai
 But in the meantime here too, the presence of a girl causes panic
 bavaal ho jaataa he
 The question is the same here
 aakhir ye ladki chaahati kya he?donon hi jagahon par ho rahi inshaadiyon main do ladkiyaan bin bulaai mehmanki tarah haazir hai
 And both want to save another girl's life
 lekin akhir ye maajaraa kya he? ye ladkiyaan koun hai? ye kiski zindagi bachaane kii baat kah rahi hai
 And what is the end result of this effort of these girls? So let us once again take you to Hazratganj, Lucknow
 jahanhotel ke get par abhi bhi hangaamachal rahaa he
 In fact, a businessman from Lucknow's posh area, Gomtinagar, has decided to marry his son here
 baraat hazaratganj ke is hotel main ai he
 But before getting married, this girl has staked her claim on the groom
 ladki kaa kahana he ki uski abhishek treepathi naam ke is ladke ke saath pichley 25 may ko ek mandir main shaadi ho chuki he
 But the boy is trying to get her a second marriage here
 or wo kisi bhi qeemat par aisa nahin hone degi
 Now the girl herself wants to go inside and give her two or two hands, but the ghetto and hoteliers come in the way
 ab ladki phone kar foran police ko bhi maukey par bulaati he
 The police want to go in for cleaning up the conciliation as well as understand the case
 lekin ladki ke saath-saath hotel ke surakshakarmi pulisavaalon ko bhi dhakke maar kar hotel se baahar kar dete hai
 And this is when the girl has already submitted her complaint to the police
 exiaar likhva chuki he
 But the girl is accused that the police are not supporting her
 isliye use sidhi karrwai par utarana padaa he
 Whereas, Daroga, who arrived on the occasion, narrates a different story
 police ne ladki kii shikaayat par kya karrwai kii, iskaa to pataa nahin
 But from the talk of Kanaklata Dubey, the woman police station, it seems that he had tried to intimidate this girl who had come for complaint
 lihaaza, maamla yahaan tak aa pahunchaa or phir akhirkaar vahi hua
 Who was afraid police kii isi kahili kaa phayda uthaa kar duulhaa maukey se faraar ho gaya
 The story of Moradabad is the story of the civil lines of Moradabad
 yahaan gudgaanv se baraat ai thi
 The groom was an engineer
 ilaake main acchhee-khaasi shoharat thi, to ladakiwaalon ne bhi rishta pakkaa karne main koi der nahin kii
 But before this relationship got a name, marriage would have taken place
 duulhe ke saath-saath uski patni bhi apni shaadi kaa subut lekar yahaan haazir ho gai
 Moreover, there was also a two-year-old child in his lap and this girl was telling the groom the father of this child
 wo bhi tamaam subooton ke saath
 Now the same people who were being laid for so long to welcome the groom and the king
 tarah-tarah ke pakwaan pesh kar rahe the
 Realizing the chance, he came to reality
 unhone fouran duulhe samet tamaam rishtedaaron ke ghar main bithaaya or baratiyon ko bandhak bana liya
 Since the charge was very serious
 doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani karne ke liye us ladki kii sunwaayee zaruri thi
 Who came here from the same Gurgaon with her two year old child in her lap
 jahaan se baraat ai thi, to usne jo kuch kaha, wo sann karne vaala tha
 This girl said that it has been three years since her marriage with the groom named Sahil
 balki unhen ek do saal kaa betaa bhi he
 It is another matter that Sahil has been trying to get rid of her for a long time
 lihaaza, wo apni ladaai lekar kaanoon ke darvaaze par dastak de chuki he or adaalat ke aadesh par karaae gaye diene test se bhi ye sabit ho chukaa he ki uski god main maujuud is maasoom kaa pita koi or nahin balki vahi sahil he, jo khud ko kunvaara bataakar dobaaraa nikaah karne ke firaaq main he
 But the extent is that even after everything is revealed, this person is refusing to recognize his wife and child
 lekin jab subut saamne ho, to bhala duulhe kii kamazor daleel koi kyon sunata? lihaaza, ladki waalon ne unhen naa sirf bandhak bana liya, balki dahej main die gaye tamaam saamaan waapas karne tak unhen naa jane kii baat bhi saaf kar di
 Now the groom, the king and his family, who had dreamed of betraying one girl and marrying another, had to face a mouth and return unscathed
 unnav gangrape maamla lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 An FIR has been registered against accused MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar after constant pressure
 lekin upi police kaa kahana he ki abhi vah sirf aaropee hai or unke khilaaf dosha siddh nahin hua he
 UP police said that further investigation would be carried out by CBI
