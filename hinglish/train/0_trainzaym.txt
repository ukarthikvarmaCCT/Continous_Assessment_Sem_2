 On May 1, she went to the family after being produced before a magistrate
 teen baad use unheen logon ne phir se agava kar liya
 The family alleges that the same corrupt sub-inspector was involved in the conspiracy
 is baar shreya ko mumbai le jaaya gaya or vahaan golpada main ek ghar main rakhaa gaya
 He was beaten and raped several times there
 shreya ne jab aprahankartaaon ko pachaas hajaar rupye main uskaa sauda karne kii baat karte suna to usne bhaagane kii yojana banaai
 He stole some money from them and jumped from an auto rickshaw at a busy traffic light near a railway station the next morning
 vah train main baith gai, use nahin pataa tha ki train kahaan ja rahi he
 She reached Surat in Gujarat, from where she called her father
 ab vah surakshit gharon main rah rahi he
 ('all victims' names have been changed to hide identity) dilli main congress kii baat kii jaae to party ke maujuuda pradesh ajay maakan or purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ke bich 36 ke aankade kii baat kisi se chuphi nahin rahi
 When Maken took charge of the post of Delhi Congress President, Sheila was described as a bygone era
 shila ne bhi maakan par palatwaar karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 However, reports of conflict between the two continued to come
 vahiin maakan kii aguai main congress dilli main ek ke baad ek chunaav harati rahi
 In the assembly elections, the party was eliminated, and in the corporation elections, the Congress was third
 haalanki maakan ne congress kaa vot share badhane kaa hawala diya, lekin shila ne isaki kaat main kaha ki chunaav jeet hasil karne ke liye lade jate hai naa ki vot share badhaane ke liye
 Sheila's camp has been unhappy with Maken, not only Kapil Sibal, Jai Prakash Agarwal and all the leaders who were ministers at the time of the Sheila government also expressed their displeasure with Maken's style of work
 maakan kii shikaayat rahul ke darbar tak pahunchi
 Rahul then intervenes and asks Maken to look into the matter
 sambhavat: yahi sandesh diya ki sabhi ko saath lekar chalaa jaae
 Considered close to Rahul, Maken again began to repair the party organization in Delhi
 phir kahani shuru hui maakan or shila ke bich sulah sulaai kii
 However, in the beginning, Sheila shocks Maken
 sutron ke mutabik, maakan ke daftar ne shila ke daftar ko sandesh diya ki ajay maakan shila dikshit se khud milanaa chaahate hai
 When Sheila's office gave this information to Sheela, Sheela flatly denied the possibility of any such meeting
 shila ko manaane kii maakan kii koshishenmacan ne iske baad bhi koshish jari rakhi or dilli pradesh mahila congress kii adhyaksh or purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kii beti sharmishtha mukherjee se is sambandh main shila se baat karne or mulaakaat tay karaane ke liye kaha
 Sharmistha persuades Sheela and finally Maken arrives at her house to meet Sheela with Sharmishtha
 sutron ke mutabik mulaakaat kii shuruyaat main hi maakan ne shila kii tarifon ke pul baandhe or kaha ki ‘aapkaa aashirwad chahie
 People remember the work of your government throughout Delhi
 isliye meri guzarish maan lijie, aane vaale vakt main upachunaav main aap puraa sahyog kariye
 First of all, along with the big leaders of Delhi Congress, come to address the media on one platform on 14 February
 ’sutron ke mutabik, shila ne iske jawaab main do-took kaha ki, ‘maakan ji pehle aap congress par apni pasand naapsand ke hisaab se logon ko dekhnaa band kiijie
 Make all the old people AICC members
 14 farvari ko saare puraane mantriyon ko or varisht netaaon ko bulaaiye, to main bhi aauungi
 Maken assured him that he would meet him the next day after trying his best to adjust everyone
 sutron ne bataaya ki agle din maakan akele shila se mili
 Also Sheela took the names of those people whom she wanted to become AICC members
 phir ek din baad maakan dilli ke prabharee pisi chaako ke saath shila ke ghar pahunche
 Maken adjusted a lot of people like Sheila's choice, but said about 6 names, it is difficult to take them
 shila phir bhi adi raheen
 Sheela clearly told Maken that all these are Congressmen, what do you like from them? What is the beginning of new friendship? Actually, among these 6 names, Sheila was a minister in the government Mangatram Singhal, Ramakant Goswami, MLA Rajesh Lilothia, former councilor Jeetu Kochhar , Rohit Manchanda and Harnam, who were the chairman of Delhi SC Commission during Sheila Sarkar
 inako maakan ne pisisi dailygat nahin banane diya tha
 Now the dilemma is that who is not a PCC delegate, how will he become a member of AICC? In such a situation, Maken is preparing to nominate a member of AICC to take the middle path
 haalanki, manonith member ko vot kaa adhikaar nahin hota, lekin isse sulah ke asaar hai
 Due to this, the press conference of former president Subhash Chopra, former ministers AK Walia and Aaron Yusuf was held recently in Delhi Congress headquarters
 puure ghatnakram ke bich or shila-maakan kii haalia mulakaaton ke maddenjar mana ja rahaa he ki 14 farvari ko velentine de ke din dilli congress ke liye ek nae adhyay kii shuruyaat hogi
 It will be interesting to see if this date will become witness to the political reconciliation between Sheela and Maken, then how will it affect the health of the party in Delhi? To reverse the Congress day in Delhi, it is necessary that these two party veterans join hands with the heart, not under any compulsion

 ' Just a few months ago, three top Indian economists Amatrya Sen, Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagariya debated the development model of Gujarat and Kerala

 While Amatriya Sen had said that the model of Gujarat is not inclusive, the other two economists were praising Gujarat for achieving large-scale economic growth

 White House press secretary Jay Carney said, "publicly and privately, we had made clear and legitimate requests that Snowden be expelled from the United States to face the charges against him
" in anurodhon ke baavjood roosi sarkaar yah kadam uthaa rahi he, jisase hamen behad niraashaa hui he
 Carney's remarks are the first response issued by the Obama administration after the Russian Federal Immigration Service (russian Federal Migration Service) publicly confirmed that Snowden was granted temporary asylum for a year and allowed to leave the airport
 roosi sarkaar ne is faisle ke bare main america ko suchit nahin kiya tha
 Carney said Snowden is not a whistleblower
 vah gopneey soochnaaon kaa khulaasa karne kaa aaropee he or us par teen aapraadhik aarope hai
 Carney said, he (snowden) should be returned to America as soon as possible, where he would be given full protection and necessary action would be taken
 roosi faisle se obama prashasan ko hui gahari niraashaa jaahir karte hue unhone kaha, bostom marathon visphoton ke baad se kanoon banaae rakhane ke kshetra main sahyog main vruddhi hui thi
 This step by the Russian government has weakened this long-standing cooperation

 tippaniyan Carney said, he is no dissident or whistleblower
 us par aparaadh ke aarope hai
 On returning to America, he will be given all the rights and benefits which are given to other defendants under our judicial system
 unhone kaha, roosi sarkaar ke saath hamaari charchaaon main hamane is vichaar ko saarvajanik or nijee donon hi taur par jaahir kar diya he
 Carney also mentioned that Obama is going to Russia for the G20 summit

 guuruuvaar ko kendriya sanchaar mantri ravishankar prasad ne shikaayat kii ki nitish kumaar lambey samay se special package kii maang karte rahe or jab piem ne elaan kiya to unka dhanyavad bhi nahin kiya
 Ravi Shankar said, 'I was pained that Nitish Kumar did not thank the PM even once for the Bihar package'
 bihar ke liye sava lakh karod ke package ke baad nitish kumaar par yah bijepi kaa nayaa hamalaa he
 But jdu's answer is clear - PM did not do any favor
 jediu netaa kasee tyaagi ne enditivi se kaha, 'ye rajyon kaa haq he
 PM did no favor on Bihar
 ' In fact, the announcement of a special package for Bihar has become the focal point of the ongoing political fight between the NDA government and nitish-lalu
 endie sarkaar kaa daawa he ki nitish kumaar lambey samay tak centre sarkaar se special package kii maang karte rahe hai or ab jab piem ne elaan kiya to uskaa dhanyavad bhi nahin diya
 On the other hand, JD-U argues that Nitish never asked for a special package, he has always been demanding a special status for Bihar
 sawaal is special package par bhi he
 When will Bihar get 125 lakh crores, when will they meet and how will they get it
 jediu kaa aarope he ki nai-puraani or aane vaale saalon kii skim tak isamen jod di gai he
 KC Tyagi says, "there are several budgetary proposals of 2014-15 in this package
" kai project par kaam puraa ho chukaa he

 Now nitish-lalu is trying to link this special package with the issue of self-respect of Bihar

 This is bjp's new attack on Nitish Kumar after a package of Rs 1
25 lakh crore for Bihar
 magar jediu kaa jawaab saafe he- piem ne koi ehsaan nahin kiya

 The NDA government claims that Nitish Kumar has been demanding a special package from the central government for a long time and now when the PM announced it, he did not even thank him

 The question is also on this special package
 bihar ko jo sava lakh karod milane hai, ve kab milenge or kis tarah milenge
 JDU alleges that it has been added to the scheme of the new-old and the coming years

 There is a period of contemplation and meetings in the party about the defeat

 Chief Minister Kamal Nath, former CM and veteran leaders Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia were present in the meeting
 jis vakt party kii baithak chal rahi thi us dauraan jyotiraditya sindhiya ke samarthak siem awaas ke baahar narebaaji kar rahe the

 Scindia had come to pay homage to Shivraj's father Prem Singh Chauhan
 bataa den ki shivaraj singh chouhan ke pita prem singh chouhan kaa haal hi main nidhan ho gaya tha
 He was ill for several days
 vah 85 saal ke the
 Earlier, Madhya Pradesh Congress President and CM Kamal Nath had called a core committee meeting on 8 June
 jiske baad donon hi netaa kamalnath ke awaas par baithak main shaamil hone ke liye pahunche the
 Congress leaders and workers have been disappointed since the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 party kii aisi haar kii kisi bhi netaa ko ummid nahin thi
 The party had projected 15 seats out of 29
 parinaam party or sarkaar ke anuroop kyon nahin aae, yah ek paheli ban kar rah gaya he
 There is a churn in the party to resolve this
 bataa den ki 29 loksabhaa siton vaale madhya pradesh main congress ko mahaj 1 seat hi mili
 The poor performance of the Congress can be gauged from the fact that Jyotiraditya Scindia, who won from the fold in the Modi wave in 2014, could not save his seat this time
 rajya main kharaab pradarshan ke baad party main nayaa adhyaksh banaae jane ke charchaa he
 Currently, Kamal Nath is the president of the state unit
 haalanki congress ke liye nae pradesh adhyaksh kaa chayan karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 The state has veteran leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia, Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh
 yahaan gutbaji charam par he
 In such a situation, it would be difficult to say that a common president can be easily elected in these situations

 The target of the excise department was to achieve a revenue of 4900 crores in 2016-17, but from the contracts auctioned this time, it seems that the excise department will get more than 5400 crores revenue this time
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki navaniyuktcongress sarkaarne apane menifesto main vaayada kiya tha ki wo punjab main sharaab ke failte prachlan ko kam karne ke liye sharaab ke thekon main kami laaegi or pradesh main sharaab ke thekon kii sankhya is baar 6384 se ghataakar 5900 kar di gai lekin iske baavjood sarkaar oonchi license fees par thekon kii nilaamee karne main kaamyaab rahi he
 Another surprising thing is that the Excise Department had already made it clear that no liquor shops would be opened within 500 meters of the State and National Highways, but despite this condition, liquor dealers auctioned liquor contracts in Punjab It has been taken up by the hands and these figures of the Excise Department have also made it clear how the prevalence of alcohol in Punjab has spread its feet

 The battle for political supremacy in Haryana Congress is well known between former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Congress State President Ashok Tanwar
 soobe main donon netaaon ke apane-apane kheme hai or ek duusare ke khilaaf khulkar siyaasi shah-maat kaa khel khelte rahe hai
 Now it seems that the battle for political supremacy has moved towards taking the form of rebellion in the party
 bhupinder singh hooda congress se itar nai siyaasi raah talash rahe hai
 In this episode, he has also started looking towards the BJP with hopeful eyes
 to vahiin bijepi ko bhi jat netaa kii shiddat se jarurat he, jo jaaton ko saadh sake
 Actually, even after losing power in Haryana, the Congress's internal discord is not taking the name of ending
 hooda or tanvarakhema ek duusare ke khilaaf baghawat kaa jhanda pichley teen saal se uthaae hue hai
 But the party Alakaman is unable to find a solution
 yahi vajah he ki ab bhupinder singh hooda nae siyaasi thikaane ke talash main he
 If sources are to be believed, Hooda has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice in the last one week
 ye mulaakaat bhale kii chand minuton kii rahi ho , lekin is mulaakaat se soobe main siyaasi halchal tej ho gai he
 The Hooda camp is calling this meeting a courtesy call, but it has political significance
 hooda ne modi se mulaakaat karke apane mansoobey bhi congress alaakaman ke saamne jaahir kar die hai
 If he is not given the command of the party by the hands of Ashok Tanwar, he will not delay in leaving the party and joining the BJP
 hooda pichley kareeb teen varsh se apane samarthak vidhayakon or party netaaon ke madhyam se party alaakaman par is baat ke liye dabaav banaae hue hai ki haryana congress kii kaman unhen hi saunpi jaae
 The pro-hooda MLA has many times openly raised the demand to replace Congress President Ashok Tanwar and Legislature Party leader Kiran Chaudhary
 hooda jahaan ek taraf apane siyaasi thikaana talas rahe hai to vahiin duusari taraf soobe main bijepi se jaaton kii naaraazgi badi he, jisase bijepi main bhi bechaini he
 While the BJP has Captain Abhimanyu and Chaudhary Birender Singh as a Jat leader, the two leaders do not have the political stature equal to Hooda
 pichley dinon soobe jat aarakshan ko lekar jat samaaj main naaraazgi badi he
 This is the reason why the BJP is looking for a strong Jat leader with great vigor
 maukey kii najaakat ko samajhate hue hooda ne bada daanv chalaa he
 If sources are to be believed, Hooda has laid his political pieces through Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar

 piples libration army ke ek general jhang ne november 2017 main khudakushi kar lee
 This suicide surprised everyone but this incident was not the first
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik, 2012 or 2017 ke darmyaan 158 chini afasar khudakushi kar chuke hai
 This was also the time when Jabashi Jinping completed his first term
 phir aktubar main party kii 19veen congress main dashakon main desh ke sabase kaddavar netaa ke taur par ubharne ke baad paanch saal kaa apana doosraa kaarykaal shuru kiya
 There is also a rumor that in view of the officially declared 'natural' death of many officers undergoing investigation or detention, the actual number of suicides could be much higher
 china main maao tse tung kii saanskrithik kranti (1966-76) ke baad communist party ke afasaron kii aatmahatya kii shaayad sabase zyada taadaad he
 At that time, thousands of people, harassed by insult in public hearings at the hands of the Red Guard, went ahead and embraced death
 sarkari chinis academy of soshal sycenge (sieeses) ke ek adhyayan ke mutabik, 2009 se kam se kam 243 afasar apni jaan de chuke hai
 Shockingly, 85 of these suicides took place in the last months of 2012, in the four years before Xi became incarcerated — that is, about 21 suicides each year
 uske baad ke chaar saal ve the, jab chini siyasat ke upar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ek jan abhiyaan chaaya rahaa or is dauraan shuddhikaran ke naam par hajaaron afasaron kaa safaya kar diya gaya

 "wang also says that" many of those who have killed themselves were under scrutiny in one form or the other and believe that one of the reasons is that if they embrace death, The investigation will be closed '' and thus they will be able to protect their partners, families and properties
 human ritis watch kii maaya wang kahati hai, ''kamishan bananaa acha kadam ho saktaa he par main shaq hi karuungi

 sheersh bhartiya badminton khilaadi sina nehwal ne final main spain kii carolina marin ko haraakar 7,50,000 dollars inami raashi kii star australian super siries trophy apane naam kii
 The sixth seeded Indian player won the India Open Grand Prix Gold title earlier this year
 unhone 43 minute tak chale final mukaable main dabadabe bharaa pradarshan karte hue 21-18, 21-11 se jeet darj kii, jisase unhen 56,000 dollar kii inami raashi mili
 Saina had won the last Super Series trophy at the Indonesia Open in June 2012
 khitaabi jeet se khush is khilaadi ne kaha, main is jeet se bahut khush hum
 i got the result of my hard work
 mere kochon ne mujhe choton se dur rakhane ke liye sachmuch kaaphi kadi mehnat kii
 This victory could not have come in a better time than this
 is 24-varshiya khilaadi ne kaha, yah mere liye bahut hi mahatvapurn varsh he, kyonki main apane rashtramandal khelon ke swarna padak kaa bachaav karuungi or asian khel bhi isi saal yojit honge
 So this will boost my confidence
 sina kaa marin ke khilaaf record 1-0 tha, unhone apni pratidwandvi ke khilaaf kuch shandaar shot or behtareen woli khelkar shuruaati game main 5-2 kii badhat hasil kii
 But 21-year-old Marin was also not easy to fall behind and narrowed the gap to 6-8
 marin ne haalanki sarvice kii galati kar sina ko ek aasaan ank bhent swaroop de diya, jisase is bhartiya ne 11-7 kii badhat hasil kii
 Marin then improved her game, but Saina was also ready for a counter-attack and responded swiftly to her opponent's smash
 is bich, marin ne kuch behtareen strokes khele, lekin ye nirantar nahin the or sina ne badhat 17-12 kii kar lee
 Marin's commitment could be seen for every point, but it was not enough to beat Saina
 marin kii aakraamak bhaawanaaon se sina jaraa bhi prabhavit nahin huin or is hyderaabadi khilaadi ne 23 minute main 21-18 se pehla game apane naam kar liya
 Marin's determination in the second game helped them take a 3–1 lead, but Saina bounced back soon
 unhone besaline par kuch behtareen strokes se vaapasi kii
 But perhaps inspired by Marin, Saina also showed some emotions, she was seen screaming 'come on', squeezing her wrist after scoring every point
 lekin ek baar unki cheekh raily ke bich main ai, jise marin ne chair ampire se shikaayat kii, jinhone unhen khelnaa jari rakhane ke liye kaha
 Marin did not get any benefit from this distraction and Saina took an 11-4 lead over the Spaniard
 brake ke baad sina ne dabadabaa jari rakhaa or niyamit rup se marin ko galtiyaan karne ke liye uksaaya, jo shuruaati game jaisaa jajba dikhaane main jujh rahi thim
 Saina then dropped the morale of the opponent by applying some of her traditional smashes, leaving her shoulders bowed
 lekin jeet se pehle kuch naatakeey kshan dekhne ko mili
 Saina was leading 19-9, but challenged a 'line call' which went against her
 lekin riple main dikh rahaa tha ki shatal wide gai thi
 The Indian made another mistake, smashing into the net while playing the next point
 sina ne haalanki isaki jaldi bharpai kii or marin ke wide shot khilne se khitaab apane naam kiya

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the Election News Special Newsletter modi sarkaar ne ek hafte pehle jis 8,500 karod rupee ke raahat package kaa elaan kiya tha use kisaan sanghon ne ankhon main dhul jhonknaa bataaya he
 After the Kairana by-election, where non-payment of cane arrears was an important issue, the Center approved a package of Rs 7,000 crore for the sugar industry
 isse pehle bhisarkaarne milon ke liye 1,500 karod rupee kaa niryaat incentive dene kaa faisla kiya, is shart ke saath ki unhen 20 lakh metric ton chini kaa niryaat karnaa hoga
 In the package, the Convenor of Chol National Farmers' Organization, VM Singh, has described this package as mere cheating
 unhone kaha, 'cabinet ke faisle ke baad jataayaa aise gaya he ki jaise is package ke paise sekisaanon kaa bakaychukaya jayega
 The reality is that only Rs 1,175 crore has been provided which will be used to pay the dues of the farmers
 wo bhi 3 se 4 maheene ke antaraal main
 Singh claimed that out of the entire package, a substantial portion of Rs 4,440 crore would be spent on building infrastructure to boost ethanol production
 singh ne kaha, 'is paise ko bainkon kii ore se rin ke taur par diya jayega
 Also, Rs 1,320 crore will be given by the Central Government as subsidy / interest on the loan
 ye milon kii ore se lee jane vaali suvidha par nirbhar karegaa
 He said, "the government has decided to give an incentive of Rs 1,500 crore in the event of exporting 20 lakh metric tons of sugar by the mills
 ye ganne ke vaazib or laabhakaari mulya (FRP) ke bhugtan se linkd hoga
 '22 thousand crores is owed
 The farmers union leader said,' Only Rs 1,175 crores has been given which will be spent in 3-4 months to repay the arrears
 jabaki deshbhar menkisanon ke ganne kaa bakaayaa22,000 karod rupee he, vahiin akele upi main hi 12,000 karod rupee se zyada kaa bakaayaa he
 Singh said that the problem of low sugar prices was caused by the implementation of the Rangarajan report, in which the perception of releasing orders was decimated by decontrolling sugar
 ab sarkaar ne chini ko bazaar main relies karne kaa niyantran apane haath main liya, jisase sthiti kuch sudhari he
 Singh blamed the mills for falling sugar prices, which prevented farmers' payments
 unhone kaha, 'beete november se shuru hue puure sijan ke liye ek bhi paisa nahin diya gaya
 When the sugar prices were up, did the mill owners pay in time
 2007-08 main chini ke daam 16 rupee kilo se 40 rupee kilo tak chadh gaye the tab bhi mil maalikon ne samay se bhugtan nahin kiya tha
 Then how can they be told that they will share their profits with the farmers? ”after the High Court order, the government alleged," UP government to order Allahabad High Court related to payment of interest on mills and fines on late payment
 " She is sitting hoicourt ne varsh 2012 se 2015 ke liye 2,000 karod rupee ke byaaj ke bhugtan kaa aadesh diya tha
 The interest was waived by the predecessor Akhilesh Yadav government of UP
 hoicourt ne yogi sarkaar ko chaar maheene main faisla lene kaa aadesh diya tha
 But even after 15 months in power, he did nothing
 'singh ne kaha ki 15 fisadi kii dar se byaaj diya janaa chahie, ise rajya sarkaar yaa ganna ayukta ke manamaane dhang se liye faislon ke aadhaar par maaf nahin kiya ja saktaa

 Then in 2014, a journalist from Bangalore, Nagalakshmi Bai, again complained to the State Election Commission, stating that Kumaraswamy hid information about his second wife Radhika Kumaraswamy in the affidavit filed for the 2013 assembly elections
 lekin is samay tak kumaraswami or radhika ke sambandhon ke bare main sabko pataa chalaa chukaa tha
 Convincing evidence about marriage was also coming out

 By the year 2015, the relationship between Radhika and Kumaraswamy started to crack
 mana jaataa he ki isaki ek vajah unke bete nikhil kaa dabaav tha jo pita ke radhika ke saath sambandho ko lekar sahaj nahin the
 According to reports, Kumaraswamy's father HD Deve Gowda was also angry over his relationship with Radhika
 oktober 2015 main media main aisi kai khabaren aane lageen ki kumaraswami or radhika ab alag ho gaye hai
 However, Radhika, in response to a question asked at a press conference in 2017, said that Kumaraswamy is still attached to her name and will remain attached till the end

 However, after a good partnership, the entire team of India were dismissed for 189 on the second day
 naawale ne pehali pari main 12 or duusari pari main 13 ran banaae

 He landed in this Test match as a wicket-keeper-batsman
 is tarah se test main bharat ke pehle wicketiper kaa darja bhi inhen naawale ke naam gaya
 The name of the first victim from India as a wicketkeeper is also the name of Navel
 pehali pari main unhone vipakshi captain duglas jardin (79) ko kaich out kar pavilion chalata kiya
 This match was very good for Navale in many ways, but India lost the match by 158 runs
