 com / wfpt4x8thh After the whitewash in the ODI series, Ajinkya Rahane's youth team is now ready for 20-20
 koshish donon match jitkar series ko clin sweep karne kii hogi
 Team India does not look very concerned about this series, but there is definitely a question of doing something different in front of Zimbabwe
 vaise bharat tii-20 cricket main zimbabwe se kabhi nahin haara he
 Every player has taken full advantage of the opportunity in the series
 main of da series ambati rayudu ke chotil ho jane ke baad manish pandeya ko mauqaa mila, to unhone 71 ran banaakar niraash nahin kiya
 In the last match, Kedar Jadhav has strengthened his claim by scoring a century
 kedaar jadhav ne whitewash ke baad kaha, 'hamane kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki 3-0 se jeetenge
 We anticipated that it would not be easy to defeat Zimbabwe on their land
 ye chunauteepurn tha
 Especially batting first in all three matches, but the batsmen did a good job scoring 250 plus
 hamen isiilie jeet mili
 ' tii-20 main team ko zyaada aakraamak hona padega
 Captain Ajinkya Rahane and Murali Vijay will be expected to start fast
 robin uthppa vanade series main 3 maichon main 14
 Only 44 runs at an average of 66
 uthppa ke kariyar ke liye tii-20 behad ahm he
 Sanju Samson may get a chance to start his international career
 duusari ore zimbabwe ke liye vaapasi karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 To strengthen the morale and performance of the team will have to be emphasized

 At the same time, Zimbabwe's bowling has been better than his batting so far
 jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana aatanki masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karne kii pahal phir shuru ho gai he
 It is reported that America, France and Britain have talked to China in this matter
 is baatcheet main suraksha parishad ke teenon sadsy deshon ne masood ajahar ke khilaaf china se samjhauta karne kaa prayaas kiya
 It is believed that this conversation was good and a new twist could come in this matter soon
 maamle ke jaankaar logon ke anusaar yadi is prayaas ke baavjood ajahar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit nahin kiya jaataa to teen sthaayee sadsy is mudde par khuli bahes ke liye prastaav sanyukt raashtra kii sabase shaktishaalee shakha main pesh karne kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Let me tell you, China vetoed the proposal to declare Azhar a global terrorist
 is prastaav ko america, france or britain ne pesh kiya tha
 India had expressed disappointment with this attitude of China
 america ne chetavanee dete hue kaha ki agar china hamaara saath nahin degaa to ham duusare tareeke apanaayenge
 Although the internal talks of the Security Council committee are kept confidential, this time, many members of the council, frustrated by China's inappropriate attitude to protect the terrorist, kept their identities confidential and told the media how China was playing a negative role
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki prastaav ke mul praayojak pichley 50 ghanton se china ke saath ‘‘sadbhaavna’’ vaarta kar rahe hai, jise maamle ke jaankaar kai logon ne ‘samjhauta’ qaraar diya he
 This means that Azhar will be declared a Global Terrorist in the UN Security Council Committee, but the language used when declaring him a terrorist would be acceptable to China
 mana ja rahaa he ki china ne ajahar ko aatankwaadi ghoshit kiye jane kii bhashaa main ‘‘kuch badlaavon’’ kaa suzav diya he or america, britain tathaa france in sujhaavon par vichaar kar rahe hai
 The three countries have indicated that they are willing to accept China's request to change the language if the motif of the proposal does not change and ultimately Azhar is declared a global terrorist
 lekin america, france, britain or suraksha parishad ke anya sadsy ateet ke vipareet, is baar china ke saath vaarta kaa nishkarsh nikalne tak bahut adhik der intjaar karne ke icchhuk nahin hai
 It is understood that these countries have informed China that they are seriously considering other options
 ve khaskar khuli bahes par vichaar kar rahe hai jiske baad prastaav par matdaan hoga
 Beijing has been informed that this will happen in a few months, not a few weeks, but a few days
 saath hi, in deshon ke adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki china pehle kii tulana main is baar adhik sahyog kar rahaa he
 China's cooperation on this proposal would be considered a big success
 china, america, britain or france ke bich baatcheet hona ek sakaaratmak sanket mana ja rahaa he

 Nearly 55,000 officers of state-run oil companies have gone on strike demanding salary hike and interim relief
 isse desh bhar main petrol or rasoi gas kii aapurti baadhit hone kii ashanka he
 But the officials are blaming the government for the strike by calling it a compulsion
 hadtaal kaa aam logon par kitna asar padegaa, yah tay karnaa abhi mushkil he, lekin sarkaar ne puure vaikalpik bandobast kaa bharosa dilaayaa he
 The government may also enlist the help of the regional army to run the operations
 is bich, sarkaar ne kaha he ki vah hadataaliyon se phir se baatcheet ko taiyaar he
 This is also important for the country's economic health, as it is estimated that the strike would cause oil companies a loss of about four and a half billion rupees a day
 duusari ore,transportron kii hadtaal bhi jari he
 Transporters have clearly stated that it is difficult to run trucks in deficit until the government gives relief
 eiemtisi kaa haunsala is baat se bhi buland he ki north india tanker onors association ne bhi hadtaal main shaamil hone kaa elaan kar diya he
 This simply means that the supply of oil and cooking gas will be disrupted
 haalanki, trakon kii hadtaal kaa bazaar main bahut zyada asar nahin dikh rahaa, lekin dilli kii sabase badi mandi ajadpur main maalon kii supplai main giravat shuru ho chuki he
 The government is threatening to bring Esma to bring the trucks back on the roads, but the transporters are not bothered
 aise main agar hadtaal jari rahaa, to transport udyog ko kam se kam 50,000 crores kaa nuksaan uthaanaa hoga

 The Prime Minister said, "it is true that we have a border dispute with China
 lekin pichley 40 saal main seemaa vivaad main ek bhi goli nahin chali he
 '' modi ne ukt baat is sawaal ke jawaab main kahi ki kya china kii ‘van belt van road’ pariyojna ko lekar bharat kaa virodh donon deshon ke sambandhon main gahare matbhed darshata he
 Modi shared the dais with Russian President Vladimir Putin and leaders from Austria and Moldova during a panel discussion at the St

 bharat ne ‘‘samprabhutaa’’ ke mudde kaa hawala dete hue china dwaara pariyojna ko lekar haal main yojit sheersh sammelan kaa bahishkaar kar diya tha kyonki ‘van belt van road’ pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir se hokar gujarata he

 On the issue of China, he said that despite differences, New Delhi and Beijing have come together on the BRICS platform to set up two financial institutions, one of which is an India partner in a China-led institution and a BRICS bank where the two regional superpowers are partners
 Huh

 Commercial Land Use (CLU) has the largest game in Gurugram
 gurugram kii zyaadaatar jameen kheti yogya he, lekin apane phaayde liye kareeb har sarkaar ne kahin aar-jone to kahin commercial jone bana diya
 First, real estate agents buy land worth lakhs of farmers and then sell it in crores with CLU with the connivance of government officials
 taaja mukademe main bhi isi baat kaa zikr he ki prashasnic adhikariyon evam prabhavi bilders ke bich mileebhagat ke bina robert-dlef land deal sambhav hi nahin thi
 In this, some special people were illegally benefited by big officers along with leaders and ministers
 aise change hua land yujarobert wadra ke khilaaf darj mukademe ke mutabik bina paise ke omkareshwar property nerobertwadra kii companyskilitehospitality ko 7
 Land was sold for 5 crores
 jis check se pement dikhaayi gayi wo khate main nahin pahunchaa
 Now Skylight Hospitality was given so that Skylight Hospitality director Robert Vadra could help the Omkareshwar property by getting a housing license in the same village with its own personal influence on the then Town and Country Planning Minister
 robert wadra sonia gandhi ke damaad hai or bhupendra hooda bhi congress kii sarkaar ke mukhyamantri isliye wadra kaa bhupendra hooda par nijee prabhaav tha or hooda haryana ke toun and planning ministar the
 Skylight Hospitality Private Limited took a license to develop a commercial colony from Hooda on this land and after this Skylight Hospitality Private Limited sold the same land to another company DLF for Rs 58 crore
 DLF khud bhi haryana kii sabase badi real state company he tathaa license lene main sakasham he
 But as soon as he bought this land for Rs 58 crore, after which all the 350 acres of land in Wazirabad Gurugram were ignored and allotted wrongly
 isse DLF ko lagbhag 5000 karod kaa phayda hua
 In this way, the whole case became Quid pro que
 supreme court nedlesca 350 acre jameen par kisi bhi nirmaan par roak lagaai he, kyonki kaagajon main ye van vibhaag kii jameen he
 In 2011 in RTI in Wazirabad, it was found out that it was the land of the gram panchayat which HSIDC had acquired
 tatkaaleen mukhyamantri chautaala kii sarkaar is par lager club or park bananaa chaahati thi
 When Bhupendra Singh Hooda became Chief Minister after his government left, he opened the way for private builders
 us vakt ek maatr builder dlef hi tha
 When rebidding again, it gave 350 acres of land for 1700 crores
 ye jameen van par thi
 RTI activist Harinder Dheegra said, 'actually this land comes under the Punjab Land and Forest Act (PLFA act)
 paryaavaran or van mantralay kii ijaajat ke bina nirmaan nahin ho saktaa he
 Quid pro que means in return or compensation
 robert wadra ke khilaaf darj shikaayat main isi shabd kaa istemaal hua he
 In the case, the complainant clearly alleged that selling 3 acres of land to DLF and giving Robert Vadra a profit of 50 crores was like a favor
 ye ek chaal kii tarah he jisamen saadhe 300 acre jameen kodiyon ke bhav lee gayi
 Om Prakash Yadav, complaining about the Manesar Land Deal, said that the jam, the filling of water in Gurugram is all due to the masterplan
 gurugram main masterplan main sirf ye dekha jaataa he ki aar jone kahaan he or commercial jone kahaan he? kisaanon ko dhokhaa or apano kaa khyaal rakhaa jaataa he
 In the name of masterplan, the land of millions of farmers becomes billions
 krishi vaali jameen apane aadamiyon se kharidvaate hai phir uskaa masterplan lekar aate hai
 There were about 3 master plans in Huda government
 harinder dhingra peshey seartiai activistahai or kehete hai ki chautaala, huda yaa phir khatter jo bhi sarkaar aayi, sabhi ne manamaana CLU baanta
 This is a burden on the infrastructure
 bahut logon ke CLU diarector toun and country planning main 2016 se hi pending hai or bahut aise hai jinhone 2018 main applai kia or unka paas ho gaya
 It all happens with settings
 kuch paise dekar bahut aasaani se CLU mil jaati he

 BJP General Secretary raised the talk of Priyanka Sharma going to jail
 During the discussion on the session, BJP leader Sayantan Basu said that my party does not work with this kind of vendetta
 jharkhand or bihar ke cese main hamaari party ne kisi se baat nahin kii
 i can give you more than 100 examples of my state
 justise ganguli yahaan hai
 If they say anything against the state government, a case is put against them
 aap sochie ki jab ek supreme court ke purv justise ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to aam bijepi kaaryakarta ke khilaaf kya ho saktaa he
 a girl forwarded a photo on whatsapp, she met Priyanka Chopra and was kept behind bars for 10 days
 sayanthan basu ne kaha ki agar ratnaboli ke paas piem ko chitthee likhane kaa adhikaar he to unako mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ko bhi chitthee likhane kaa adhikaar he

 Ratnaboli said that when some people performing in front of Mamta Banerjee's house were picked up, we went and talked and said that there should be a place for dialogue but you can see the letter written by Prasoon Joshi against our letter
 bijepi netaa ne mamata sarkaar par bolaa hamalasayanthan basu ne kaha ki west bengal main jo ho rahaa he vah kisi civil soshaayti main nahin ho saktaa
 Those who are with them today, i challenge them to talk against Mamta, the same will happen to them
 mamata banerjee loktantr main vishwaas nahin rakhti
 Sedition is a regular thing in West Bengal
 ratnaboli ne kaha ki jai shri ram or aazaadee kii baat to bahut pehle se hoti rahi he lekin meraa sawaal yah he ki yah aaj mudda kyon bana
 On this, Sayantan Basu said why do you have Allergy from Jai Shri Ram

Loved my bouquet!a post shared bymadhu Raja(@madhuraja2011) onmar 12, 2017 at 12:19am PST After making the Indian batsmen easy prey on the fast and swinging pitch, England started well in their first innings and got a strong hold on the third Test cricket match on the very first day
 dekhen tisare test kii pehali pari main kaise dhahi team indiastuart broad or tim bresanan kii kaatilaanaa gendbaaji se bharat 224 ran par hi dher ho gaya
 The Indian score was 111 runs for seven wickets at one time, but with Dhoni's 96-ball 77, with the help of ten fours and three sixes, he was able to reach 200 runs with the help of 77 runs
 england ne iske baad din ke baaki bache 25 over main bina kisi nuksaan ke 84 ran banaaye
 Captain Andrew Strauss (52 not out) and Alastair Cook (27 not out) are seen in form for the first time in the series, adding to the problems for the Indians
 jahir khan kii anupasthiti main bharat kaa koi bhi tej gendbaaj in donon par khaas prabhaav nahin chhod paaya
 England are now only 140 runs behind India with all their ten wickets remaining
 egebaston kii pich se gendbaajon ko swing mil rahi thi, lekin bharatiyon ko isse koi phayda nahin mila
 Brad and Bresnan definitely vindicated their captain's decision to field first by winning the toss
 in donon ne chaar-chaar jabaki james anderson ne do wicket liye
 Trailing 0-2 in the series, India lost four wickets each in the first two seasons
 kandhe ke aaparishan se ubarne ke baad vaapasi karne vaale virendra sahvaag (00), unke safal salaami jodidar gautam gambhir (38), mahashatak kaa intjaar kar rahe sachin tendulkar (1) or acchhee farm main chal rahe rahul dravid (22) pehle satr main pavilion laute
 India hoped that the arrival of Sehwag would give the team a good start but he returned to the pavilion on the first ball
 broad kii aaf stump se baahar kii taraf teji se nikalati short pich gend ko wicketiper mat praayar ne dive lagaakar kaich kiya
 The umpire turned down England's appeal but it was clear from DRS that the ball had gone to kiss Sehwag's gloves before Prior's arrival in the gloves
 dravid or gambhir ne sahajata se pari aage badhaayi lekin pehle badlaav ke rup main aaye bresanan ne in donon kii saajhedaari 51 ran tak hi chalane di

 In the exit poll figures after the Lok Sabha elections, the NDA alliance is expected to get a big win in Maharashtra
 aaj tak-exis maai india ke agsit pole ke mutabik maharashtra ke 48 loksabhaa siton main se NDA ko 38 se 42 siton par jeet mil sakati he jabaki UPA ko sirf 6 se 10 siten milane kii sambhaavna jataai gai he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP had got 23 seats there while the ally Shiv Sena had got 18 seats
 beete paanch saalon main maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena ke bich banate-bigadate rishton ke bich agar yah aankade nateezon main tabdeel ho jate hai to yah rajya ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii badi jeet maani jaaegi
 In Maharashtra, the assembly elections were held a few days after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in which BJP won 122 seats while Shiv Sena won 63 seats
 chunaav jeetne ke baad pradesh adhyaksh rahe devendra fadanvis ko bijepi ne rajya kaa mukhyamantri banaaya tha
 At that time Fadnavis was one of the youngest Chief Ministers of the BJP
 fadanvis ne khud ko kiya sabit2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bijepi or shivasena main kuch faislon or maharashtra main varchasv ko lekar matbhed shuru ho gaye
 From the farmers' issue to the water problem, the Shiv Sena, the ally in the government, raised questions and blamed Fadnavis for it
 maharashtra main donon partiyon ke bich talkhi kaa asar dilli tak main dekhne ko mila
 The controversy grew so much that in the year 2016, in Maharashtra Municipal Corporation and Nagar Panchayat elections, both parties announced to contest elections separately
 is chunaav main jahaan bijepi ne 1147 siton par jeet darj kii vahiin shivasena ne 608 siton par kabja jamaaya
 The special thing was that under the leadership of Fadnavis, bjp's base grew further
 nagar nikaay chunaav main bijepi ne pehle se behatar pradarshan ko apane balboote doharaaya
 After this result, Fadnavis's image grew in both BJP and Maharashtra politics
 haalanki iske baad sarkaar main sahyogi rahi shivasena ke hamale unpar or bad gaye or mukhpatr 'saamana' main aae din unhen har samasya ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jane laga
 The BJP also created history in Maharashtra Municipal Elections held in 2018 and won 41 out of 78 seats in Sangli with heavy votes
 is jeet ke baad fadanvis kii chhavi maharashtra kii raajnneeti main or badi ho gai jisase shivasena asahaj hone lagi
 The Shiv Sena was first angered later, with Diya Fadnavis breaking a nearly 25-year-old friendship between the BJP and Shiv Sena on 23 January 2018 and party president Uddhav Thackeray announced to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections alone
 us vakt shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne media ke saamne kaha tha ki main vachan detaa hum ki ham apane dam par desh ke sabhi rajyon main chunaav ladenge chaahe jeeten yaa haare lekin chunaav apane dam par hi ladenge
 At that time, Shiv Sena had also claimed that it would win 25 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and 150 seats in the assembly elections
 haalanki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle hi kai daur ke maan-manouvval ke baad shivasena ek baar phir bijepi ke saath milakar hi loksabhaa chunaav ladi
 During this time, the most important thing was that even after separating itself from NDA, Shiv Sena never withdrew support from BJP in the state or at the center
 akele ladane ke elaan ke baad bhi maharashtra main shivasena cote ke mantri pad par bane rahe
 Fadnavis was also instrumental in making Shiv Sena a part of the NDA just before the election
 ab aane vaale samay main sabhi kii nazren isi baat par tiki rahengi kii kya shivasena vidhansabha chunaav bhi bijepi ke saath ladegi yaa siton par baat nahin banane par duusare raste par jaaegi 
 During the Lok Sabha elections till date, when Aaj Tak spoke to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, he said that all the work he had done for Maharashtra in the last five years had never happened before
 maharashtra main sookhaa, pani kii kami, kisaanon ke karj, gaanvon main aadharbhoot sanrachana kaa abhaav, aparaadh, berogari se lekar tamaam muddon par kaha tha ki ham is par lagaataar behatar kaam kar rahe hai or inhen kaamon ko lekar loksabhaa chunaav or uske baad phir vidhansabha chunaav main maharashtra kii janata ke bich jaaenge
 After the end of the Lok Sabha elections, there is also a possibility of assembly elections at the end of this year
 aise main bijepi ko satta main dobaaraa laane kii sabase badi jimmedaari fadanvis par hi he or isko lekar unhone taiyaari bhi abhi se hi shuru kar di he
 From the booth level to the block level, he is busy strengthening the BJP and is constantly scouring the remote areas of Maharashtra to understand the needs and reasons of displeasure before the elections

 Justice Markandey Katjuke is the disclaimer in a post on the English blog 'satyam Bruyat'
 mahatma gandhi par likhe post menkatju kehete hanjo kuch bhi wo kehete hai wo prachaar ke liye nahin balki rashtrahit main kehete hai
 So are his comments on the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose really in the national interest? At least the Rajya Sabha did not think so
 buudhvaar ko rajya sabha main katju ke khilaaf paas hua ninda prastaav is baat kaa saboot he
 However, Markandeya Katju's attitude has intensified following the censure motion of Rajya Sabha
 ab justise katju kaa kahana he ki unke khilaaf mahaj ninda prastaav naakaafi he or unhen bina mukademe ke faansee kii sajaa di jaani chahie
 Katju had a tweet on March 10, in which he said, "gandhi was an agent of the British, and Subhash Chandra Bose was an agent of the Japanese
" donon agenton main zyada fark nahin he
 "former Supreme Court judge Katju is often in the news for his statements
 pesh hai katju ke kuch aise bayaan jo vivaadon ke chalate surkhiyon main rahe
 On the motion of censure in Rajya Sabha "oh! Amazing news
" rajya sabha (bhartiya sansad kaa ucch sadan) ne meri ninda main ek prastaav paarit kiya he
 But this is certainly not enough
 mujhe us farji, jise rashtrapita kaha jaataa he or japani phasiston ke agent ke bare main jo maine kaha uske liye bhi avashya dandit kiya janaa chahie
 Condemnation is not just punishment
 "+++"kya main sadan ke mananeey sadasyon ko vinamr suzav de saktaa hum kyonki unamem saaf taur par vichaaron kaa abhaav he

 "make Katrina the President" i have always supported the selection of beautiful women such as film actresses in elections
 aisa isliye kyonki netaa hameshaa chand dilaane kii baat karenge, lekin kabhi janata ke hit kaa kaam nahin karenge
 So since you have to choose one or the other, why not vote for the least beautiful face
 kam se kam media main us sundar chehre ko dekh kar aapako kshanik sukh to hoga
 Otherwise you will not achieve anything like this in the end
 meri salaah he ki katrina caff ko aglaa raashtrapati banaaya jaae, is shart par ki shapathgrahan ke maukey par vah 'shila kii javaani' gaanaa gaayen

 "kiran se behatar hai shajia"main maanata hum ki kiran bedi se zyada shajia ilmi khubasurat hai
 If BJP had made Shazia Ilmi as its CM candidate then surely the party would have won Delhi elections
 kyonki log sundar chehre ko zyada se zyada vot dete hai, jaise kii kroeshia main hua
 Even a person like me who did not vote would vote for Shazia
 'dimag main bheja nahin"main kah saktaa hum ki nabbe pratishat bhartiya bevakoof hote hai
 You would not have sent it in your mind
 unhen aasaani se bahakaaya ja saktaa he
 "not only this
 baat un dinon kii he jab justise katju bhartiya press parishad ke adhyaksh hua karte the
 Katju proved to be incapable of stopping the attack on journalists, then warned the Maharashtra government to be sacked through the President
 is bare main katju ne tatkaaleen mukhyamantri prithviraj chahvan ko do patr likhe lekin unhen jawaab nahin mili
 Then he sent a third letter with a show cause notice
 notice main katju ne likhaa tha, "chunki aapaki sarkaar samvidhan kii dhara 19 (1)([e) ke tahat di gai press kii aazaadee ke adhikaar ko lagu karwaane main aksham siddh hoti dikh rahi he, to ham kyon na bharat kii raashtrapati ko samvidhan kii dhara 356 ke tahat aapaki sarkaar ko barkhaast karne kii sifarish kar den?"katrina caff ko lekar apane bayaan sahit kuch baton ke bare main katju ne baad main kaha ki unhone wo baaten gambhirtha se nahin kahi thi
 That is, to understand Katju's statement, we have to wait for his next statement
 katju kii syrius baton ko halke main lenaa, ek mushkil kaam he

 The ongoing match between India and Sri Lanka should have been blocked due to pollution

 Pollution will have to be done first in Delhi, only then can any match be played here

 Accusing the 'political conspiracy' and 'attempts to fool Muslims', the Trinamool Congress has demanded a ban on further campaigning in the Union Minister, Beni Prasad Verma, Uttar Pradesh elections
 trinmul congress ne pichde muslimon ko kota ke tahat kota dene ke congress netaaon ke bayaan par aapatti jataai he
 Trinamool Congress leader Sultan Ahmed also rejected the Congress's argument that the model electoral code of conduct has no statutory status
 ahamed ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘jab duusari partiyon kaa maamla aata he to yah aachaar samhita hota he lekin sattarudh party ke liye iskaa koi myne nahin he
 It's amazing
 pahalesalmaan khurshidane kaha kimuslimon ko nau fisadi aarakshandiya janaa chahie jabaki sarkaar ke str par aisa koi nirnay nahin tha
 He said that now Beni Prasad is doing so
 unka maananaa he ki muslim kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 it's not going to happen
 agar sarkaar muslimon ko aisa kuch dene par gambhir he to isaki ghoshnaa sarkaar ke str par honi chahie
 Addressing an election rally in the presence of Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh and Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid on Wednesday night, Verma said, "reservation for Muslims will be increased and if the Election Commission wishes, it can issue notice to me
 ’ahamed se yah poochne par ki kya vah uttarapradesh chunaavon main verma ko pratibandhit karne kii maang karte hai to unhone kaha, ‘bilkul
 The Election Commission can ban such leaders
 unhen (benny) rajya main chunaav prachaar karne se pratibandhit kar dena chahie
 The Election Commission should take it seriously into consideration
 salmaan or benny ne chunaav adarsh samhita kaa ulanghan kiya he
 'minister of State for Tourism Ahmed also asked the Prime Minister to clarify the situation on Muslim reservation
 unhone kaha, ‘chunki manmohan singh kii sarkaar he isliye muslim aarakshan par unhen bolnaa chahie
 The government is silent while its ministers are speaking
 ’ baharhaal unase jab poocha gaya ki kya yahi maang vah khurshid ke liye kar rahe hai to ahamed ne naa main jawaab diya or kaha, ‘kanoon mantri chunaav ayog se maafee maang chuke hai
 'he insisted that Beni Prasad Verma and Salman Khurshid' were not listening to the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog ko is bare main gambhir hona padegaa
 Ahmed said, 'they are talking nonsense
 ve logon ko murkh bana rahe hai
 If the government is serious, then it has the report of Ranganath Mishra Commission and Sachar Commission
 vah unki anushansaaon ko lagu kyon nahin karti
 'the Election Commission has started to ascertain whether Beni Prasad Verma's remark of giving quota to the minorities under the quota is a violation of the Election Code of Conduct at a rally in Farrukhabad on Wednesday night

 During the discussion on the bill that came in the Lok Sabha to enact a law against triple talaq, a member said abusive speech to Asaduddin Owaisi, president of All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen, who was opposing the bill
 ovaisi ne is par aapatti bhi jataai lekin spikar ke samajhane par unhone is mudde ko vahiin khatm kar dena thik samajha
 When Owaisi was giving a speech, a member sitting in the house targeted him and said, 'he has gone mad'
 ovaisi ne ye shabd sune to turant spikar sumitra mahajan se is par aapatti jataai
 Owaisi said, 'now see Madam, he is saying that i have gone mad
 itnaa to pagal nahin hum ki aapaki sajeesh na samaj sakuun
 Madam this is not good '
 jawaab main sumitra mahajan se kisi par dhyaan na dene or chair se mukhaatib rahane ko kaha
 Owaisi then continued his speech
 ovaisi ne ravishankar prasad par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki aap muslim mahilaon ko samanta, adhikaar dilaane kii baat karte hai lekin aapke paas ek bhimuslim mahilanhin he
 Not a single MP of you is a Muslim
 aap kis duniya main rah rahe hai
 Do you think people will get into your breathtaking talk
 aap is kanoon ke jariye mahilaon se anyaay khatm nahin kar rahe hai balki muslim patiyon ko or mauka de rahe hai taaki wo mahilaon se zyada anyaay kar sake or aap unhen jail bhej saken
 This is your motive

 The government said that we will prepare a new structure for this
 yani ye hamaare personal lau ko khatm karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 This bill is a preparation for this

 In the budget of 0, an additional tax of about Rs 2 per liter has been imposed on petrol and diesel

 50 rupees per liter dealers have to pay commission
 yani agar tex nahin hota to dijal sirf 41 rupee prati litre main hi miltaa
 More benefit to the Center: The effect of increasing excise in budget is that now the Central Government will benefit more than the states in terms of tax on the sale of petrol and diesel
 tex badhaane se centre sarkaar ko kareeb 30,000 karod rupee kaa phayda ho saktaa he
 The reason for this is that no part of the cess the central government imposes is given to the states
 sirf basic exise duty kaa hissaa rajyon ko baantnaa hota he
 In fact, in the Economic Survey, it was expected that due to softening of crude oil prices in the international market, petrol and diesel prices will come down this year, due to this, the government has already increased the revenue due to tax

 This stand by Nitish Kumar is certainly a major setback for leaders from the BJP government at the Center to the Bihar BJP, who have until now believed that in view of the Bihar Assembly elections after support for the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on the citizenship law Nitish Kumar will not leave him on the NRC issue either

 Pakistan has set its own conditions and rules, opposing all the proposals of India for the operation of Kartarpur Corridor
 bharat kaa prastaav he ki sikhon ke sabase pavitra sthalon main se ek kartarpur coridor ko puure saal kholaa jaae taaki tirthayatriyon ko sahuuliyat ho
 But Pakistan has opposed this proposal
 adhikariyon ne shanivaar ko yah jaankaree di
 Kartarpur is the workplace of the first Sikh Guru Nanak Dev
 pakistan ne bharat ke sabhi prastaavon kaa virodh karte hue kaha ki sirf 700 tirthayatri hi kartarpur sthit gurudwara darbar sahib main darshan kar sakate hai
 Pakistan's refusal of India's proposal, according to a government official, Pakistan said that pilgrims will be allowed to come under the Kartarpur Special Permit System as well as to pay a fee for it
 vahiin bharat kaa prastaav tha ki tirthayatriyon ke kartarpur aane par na to koi vija lage or na hi koi travel fees
 India also proposed that apart from Indian citizens, the diaspora should also be allowed to come on pilgrimage
 lekin pakistan ne iske liye manaa kar diya or kaha ki sirf bhartiya nagarikon ko hi aane kii ijaajat di jaaegi
 It was also proposed to allow only 700 travelers to India to allow pilgrims to do pilgrimage all year and seven days of the week
 lekin pakistan yahaan bhi ada rahaa
 He said that only when the pilgrims would be allowed would he come
 bharat kaa kahana tha ki har din 5 hajaar logon ko tirthayatra kii ijaajat di jaae lekin pakistan ne kaha ki 700 se zyada tirthayatriyon ko ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 However, Pakistan did not respond to India's proposal, which said that 10,000 people should be allowed to visit on special days
 bharat ne kaha ki chaahe vyakti akelaa ho yaa samooh main ho, use aane kii ijaajat milani chahie
 But Pakistan said that only a group of 15 people would be allowed to come
 raavi nadi par pul nirmaan ke bharat ke prastaav par bhi pakistan ne inkaar kar diya
 Apart from this, there was no response to the proposal of pilgrims walking on the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor
 ek adhikari ne kaha, ''pakistan ke asahyog ke baavjood kartarpur coridor kaa nirmaan kaary teji se chal rahaa he or project 12 november 2019 se pehle khatm ho jayega
 This day marks the 550th light year of Guru Nanak Dev
 ''project latakaane kii koshish main pakiske alaava paisanger terminal building (peetibi) kaa kaam bhi teji se chal rahaa he

 For this 53 acres of land has been acquired and 45 percent work has been completed so far
 lekin pakistan ke saath jo samjhauta hua he, uske tahat dedline par kaam nahin chal rahaa he
 Pakistan is trying to hang the work of this project on its behalf

 On New Year's Eve most of the Russians were busy preparing for the festival, when the outskirts of southwestern Moscow were rocked by the explosion
 nayaa saal shuru hone ke kuch hi vakt pehle ek shooting club ke parisar main hue is dhamaake main ek kii maut ho gayi or ek guest house barbaad ho gaya tha
 But according to Russian investigators, the explosion prevented the detonation of two human bombs that took place in Russia, otherwise the incident occurred on the New Year, which would have blurred the happiness of the New Year for years
 adhikariyon ke mutabik, dhamaake main maari gai mahila ek aatmghaatee maanav bam thi
 At the time of the explosion, she was preparing herself to do a blast in central Moscow during the New Year's party
 dhamaakon se bachaav sirf is vajah se ho sakaa kyonki north coxs militant kii ore se prashikshit us mahila maanav bam ke sharir par bam vaala belt shahar ke madhya main pahunchane se pehle hi fat gaya
 The second woman human bomb was running away from this incident but she was arrested by the police, says the Russian National anti-terrorism Committee, the woman human bomb died due to the explosion
 uski saathi jo khud ko dhamaake ke saath udaane vaali thi vah bhi giraftaar ho gai
 Tejashwi Yadav, bihar ke up mukhyamantri or lalu yadav ke bete tejasvi yadav ne media ko aade haathon liya he
 He wrote in his Facebook post that the special attachment of Lalu and his family to media houses and their 'corporate' personnel is not hidden from anyone
 yah usee prakaar kaa lagaav he, jis tarah kaa bhaajapa kaa lagaav he lalu ji se
 a sad feeling Do not like or ignore Explaining step behavior would be considered equivalent to reducing it
 bihar main naa jane kitne patrakaron kii naukari hi lalu ji ke naam par chal rahi he? lagbhag chaar dashak se lalu ji rashtriya raajnneeti ke majboot stambhon main se ek rahe hai or yah baat kisi ko pasand ho yaa naa ho, desh kii raajnneeti main nirvivaad rup se shirshatam netaa bane hue hai
 Whether at the center or in the state remained away from power or remained a part, there was no shortage of relevance and fame
 kabhi unhen gavaala to kabhi chutile or mazaaqia andaaz ke liye masakhra bataaya gaya
 Even then, when the heart was not filled, the story of political end was narrated on every minor failure
 par har baar purvaagrah peediton ko khun kaa ghunt pinaa padaa
 Ever forced his critics to fill water with his tenure as a railway minister, he repeatedly snatched the opponent's chest with his recorded return
 bade-bade bhaajapai turram khan unke samarthan or janaadhar par send maarane kaa sapana sanjote rah gaye, par har baar munh kii khai
 The historical social change he laid with his struggle for social justice was revolutionary
 samaaj ke bade kintu dabe varg kaa shantipurna dhang se jaagran apane aap main ek uplabdhi he
 But the bjp-backed media recognizes every exercise of concealing every significant achievement and actions but exposing the negative aspect from anywhere
 lalu ji sachche gau paalak hai, gau sevak hai
 But the media, which glorified others on this matter, never threw light on Lalu ji
 shaayad gau paalak varg se aane vaale is netaa kii sambhraant varg ke garh-raajnneeti main bahusankhyak samarthan se uthal-puthal machaa dena aaj bhi log pachaa nahin paae hai
 The hero who saved the country from communal fire by stopping Advani's chariot never got the requisite credit
 lalu ji sachche upaask hai or atyant dharmik bhi
 Every festival celebrates the festival with full devotion
 par kabhi unhen ek sachche dharmik hindu kii chhavi se nahin nawaaza gaya
 Can you call a true Hindu a fire on the religions of other religions? The whole family celebrates Chhath Puja in complete immersion, on which the whole state is watching
 par jaise vah kisi or dharm kaa parv ho, dharm ke prati samarpan or shraddha ko ujagar hi nahin kiya jaataa he
 Lalu ji popularized the national breathtaking Holi of Bihar with laughter, humor and song music
 lalu ji ke ghar hi puja upasna ke liye mandir he, par media ne kabhi dikhaaya? haa, par yogi ji kii gaayen kul kitne kilo gobar karti he, kis rang kaa gobar karti he
 It is memorized to the media personnel
 tej pratap ji shiridy, vrindavan, vindhyavasini yaa mathura jate hai, to use tirthaton ke bajaay saiyr sapata ghoshit kar diya jaataa he, par yahi kaam jab modi yaa yogi karte hai, to media ke mukh se aise moti barasate hai ki jaise ishwar kii upasna karne swayan ishwar ke avatar hi padhaare hon
 Lalu ji provides food to thousands of poor people every year on Makar Sankranti
 par sirf mehmaan netaaon ke footage par hi camere atak jate hai
 Every positive aspect associated with Lalu ji tries to hide or ignore
 kured-kured kar choti-choti baton ko bada karke sansani paidaa kii jaati he or nakaaratmak banaaya jaataa he
 Constrained by prejudice, unrestrained accusations of opponents are made their own language, the word scam is added before the investigation and the etiquette of apologizing is not shown even if nothing is found in the investigation
 ulate jaanch kii vishwasaneeyata par hi dabi zabaan sanshay paidaa kii jaati he
 If the Lalu family is to be treated in a private hospital, it will be said that leaving the people dependent on the poor health system, they themselves get treated in private hospitals and get treatment in a government hospital, then it is said that the government system is being misused, hypocrisy Happening
 janpratinidhiyon ko uplabdh protocol ke mutabik sarkari chikitsakon kii salaah lee jaati he, to ho hangaamaa machaaya jaataa he arthath lalu parivaar kahin ilaaj naa karwaae
 Chit is also mine, Pat is also mine
 maar kha liye to sahansheeltaa kaa dhong, palatwaar kiya to hinsak ravaiya
 Hey, people of the bjp-backed media, how much hatred and prejudice will you carry? If the deprivation and upliftment of the majority community is so drastic, then directly strike the issue, come out in the open, accept your traditional rivalry and sense of superiority and change if there is strength to change
 yah dushprachaar kaa chhadam yuddh band kiijie or apane purvaagrah peedit dohare ravaiye par gol-gol baaten chhod seenaa thokkar bahujan samudaay ko lalakaariye
 But at least after selling it to the BJP, don't call yourself the fourth pillar of democracy
 bhaajapa kii charan vandana or chakri karne se aap apane hi peshey ko nuqasaan pahunchaa rahe he
 Lalu has nothing to spoil and will not deteriorate

 shaadi kaa pranaam patr kai pakistani tivi channelon par dikhaaya ja rahaa he or isamen duulhe ke kollam main shoeb malik ke hastakshar bhi hai or dulhan ke kollam main maha siddki kaa naam likhaa he

 ’ siddiqui kaa parivaar daawa kar rahaa he ki shoeb ne unki beti aaysha se nikaah kiya he or agar vah bhartiya tennis star sania mirza se shaadi karte hai to yah unki duusari shaadi hogi

 aaysha ke pita mohammad siddiqui ne malik ke khilaaf adaalat main jane kii dhamkee di he or vah ulema se unke khilaaf fatve kii bhi maang kar rahe hai
 Ayesha said that she has issued this Nikahnama to prove that the marriage is done

 The amount of Haq Mehr was 500 Pakistani rupees
 ’aaysha ne kaha ki shoeb hameshaa unke vajan kii samasya se naakhush rahete the or is cricketer kii vajah se unhone nai dilli main oparation bhi karaayaa tha

 Just want to say that Ayesha is a good girl and some people are tricking her

 Marlon Samuels of the West Indies will not forget this World Cup for a long time
 quarter final muqaabale main unhone newzealand ke martin guptil kaa kaich us samay tapakaa diya tha, jab guptil mahaj 4 ran par khel rahe the
 On the third ball of the match, Samuels dropped Guptill's catch on square leg
 iske baad wellington main itihaas ban gaya or guptil ne noteout 237 ran thokkar newzealand kii semifinal main jagah pakki kar di
 However, this missed catch of Guptill reminded me of 1999, when Steve Waugh of Australia was trying to score an innings against South Africa in a Super Six match and one of his shots was dripped by Herschelle Gibbs
 iske baad steve wa ne gibs ke paas jaakar kaha tha, mat, tumne world cap tapakaa diya he
 The Australian team later managed to win the World Cup title in 1999
 guptil ne aisa kuch sampuls se to nahin kaha, lekin sampuls ne ek tarah se world cap main semifinal kaa tikat to tapakaa hi diya
 There were many such moments during this World Cup when missed catches changed the outcome of the match
 australia or pakistan ke kilaaf quarter final muqaabale main hi wahaab riyaj kii gend par shen watson kaa kaich raahat ali ne choda or glen maxwell kaa kaich sohail khan ne tapakaaya
 These two catches cost Pakistan out of the World Cup
 isi world cap ke dauraan bharat or dakshin africa ke muqaabale kii yaad he aap logon ko jab hashim amala ne shikhar dhawan kaa kaich tapakaaya tha
 At that time Dhawan was playing for just 53 runs and after that he hit 137 runs and brought India to 300 runs, where it was not difficult for India to win the match
 pakistan ke khilaaf pehle muqaabale ke dauraan bhi pakistan ke wicketiper umr akmal ne viraat kohli kaa kaich tab tapakaaya tha, jab ve 75 ran par khel rahe the, baad main kohli ne apana shatak puraa kiya
 But even more special thing is that he formed a partnership with Suresh Raina, which Pakistan could not overcome
 isi world cap main ireland ke aid jose ne dakshin africa ke khilaaf hashim amala kaa kaich jab tapakaaya, tab ve mahaj 10 ran par khel rahe the, baad main amala ne 159 ran kii badi pari khel di
 The thrill of the game of cricket is that when a player catches a catch, he changes the map of the match and sometimes it happens that one catch is overshadowed by the entire team

 karthik maas kii amavasya kii vah saghan kaali raat shriram ke swaagat main jaale jhilamilaate deepon kii pankti se roshan ho uthi thi
 Since then, the practice of celebrating this day in Hinduism by lighting a lamp with full enthusiasm and worshiping started
 tippaniyan Deepawali is also associated with the recognition of the origin of Goddess Lakshmi
 manyata he ki is din lakshmi-ganesh pujan se ghar main samruddhi or khushhaali aati he

 This was the first meeting between the soldiers of the two countries in a pleasant atmosphere after the Doklam dispute
 lekin sena koi bhi jokhim lene ko taiyaar nahin he
 After Doklam, the Indian Army, especially the Eastern Command, is on high alert
 is kaman ke tahat bahut se aise sector padate hai jo vivaadit hai or jahaan pahunchnaa or jinaki nigaraanee karnaa khaasaa mushkil kaam he
 Eastern Command is pursuing a policy of stopping the tension by turning a blind eye to the need and softening according to the situation, and is fully prepared to respond to any daring of crossing the Line of Actual Control from the Chinese Army, But Beijing also does not seem to be in a mood to soften its nature
 73 dinon kii tanatani ke baad 28 agast ko jab bharat or china, donon doklam pathaar se apni senaaon ko peeche hataane ko raji hue tab beijing ke kootnithik halake main is baat par bahes kaa daur chal padaa ki isamen antat vijeta koun rahaa
 After several weeks of bullying to teach India a lesson, China withdrew the army peacefully and dealt with it
 is faisle ko chini soshal media yugers ne china ke liye ek naitik haar bataaya
 Such was the opinion of the Chinese people that India was the winner in this dispute and China got nothing but embarrassment in the whole episode

 This will go a long way in formulating strategies for Doklam and other sectors of the Line of Actual Control

 However, the Army is not able to tell for sure that the reduction in deployment is due to winter or the PLA is indeed ready to reduce its activities
 12 janvari ko nai dilli main sena pramukh bipin ravat ne bataaya, ''vahaan par maujuud dhaanche se to aise hi sanket milte hai ki sardiyon ke khatm hone ke baad pielke kii gatividhiyaan ek baar phir se shuru ho sakati hai

 In the wake of this dispute, China had made it clear that the Chinese army would also continue to patrol their area and also complete the road construction work

 "the Doklam dispute has also given China a lesson to reconsider in terms of its military preparedness," says Zhou

 In view of this, India will also increase its construction, but given the economic power of China and the efficiency of construction work, there can be no comparison of the speed and capacity of construction work on the border of the two countries

 Significantly, during the public meeting, PM Modi also attacked the Congress
 piem modi ne kaha ki bharat mata kii jai bolne par aitraaj jataane vaali congress ab deshadroh kaa kanoon hataane kii bhi baat kah rahi he
 He said that the Congress is saying that if its government is formed in Delhi, its special rights will be taken away from the soldiers stationed in the violence areas, including Jammu and Kashmir
 matlab jo patharbaj hai, jo aatankwaad ke samarthak hai, unako khuli chhot di ja rahi he
 It is not so easy for China to siege India
 malabar sainya abhyaas ke zarie bharat ne america or japan ke saath milakar china ko apni takat dikhaai he
 Which China is always teasing about
 aaj ek aisi international khabar ai he, jo bharat kii takat ke bare main china ke bhram ko tod degi
 The confusion in which China threatens India and says that its military strength is nothing in front of China
 Two International Nuclear Experts have told in a report that any part of India can send its missile to any part of China
 Power targets have the ability to be taken
 bharat kii missile power kaa loha duniya bhi maanati he, isliye 62 kii dhamkiyaan dene vaala china kisi bhram main naa rahe
 Because in a recent report by two big nuclear experts in the US, it has been said that India is building missile power that has the capability to target every city in China
 abhi agni-4 missile ke zarie bharat uttar-purv se china ke har shahar ko target kar saktaa he
 But with the range of five thousand kilometers of Agni-5, it can target China from anywhere in India
 iskaa matlab ye he ki agar chennai se missile jaaegi to china ke kone main shanghai ko dhwast kar degi
 This report, published in an American online magazine, specifically mentions India's nuclear power and nuclear-powered missiles, in which two Hans m Kristensen and Robert s Norris wrote: India has 150 to 200 nuclear weapons
 The ability to make plutonium is present
 haalanki abhi 120 se 130 newclear hathiyaar bharat ke paas hai
 India's nuclear strategy has been particularly focused on Pakistan
 lekin ab bharat kaa focus lagaataar china kii taraf bad rahaa he
 India currently has defense systems equipped with seven nuclear capacities
 jisamen do hawaii, chaar jamini or ek samudri base belistic missile system he
 This international report claimed that India is working on at least four more that are likely to be deployed in the next ten years in view of China
 bharat ke mixilon kii takat ke bare main maanate hue is report main kaha gaya ki bharat ke paas agni-2 missile he, jo parmaanu hathiyaar ke saath 2 hazaar kilometre ke target tak ja sakati he
 In which the whole area of western, central and south of China can come under the target
 agni-4 missile uttar-purv se beijing or shanghai sahit kareeb kareeb china ke har shahar ko target kar saktaa he
 But now India is developing such power
 jisase uske paas madhya bharat or dakshin bharat main apane kisi bhi base se china ke kisi bhi shahar ko target par lene kii kshamta aa jaaegi
 If any untoward incident occurs in a leader's assembly, are our soldiers ready to face it
 kya hamaare jawan netaa yaa kisi badi hasti ko surakshit kisi sankat se bachaa sakate hai
 The answer to all these questions will be found in 'yes' only
 kyonki hamaare jawan har jagah mustaid hai or kisi bhi sankat se nipatane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Our soldiers gave evidence of this to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 haal hi main jab pradhanmantri narendra modi kendriya audyogic suraksha bal (CISF) ke 50wein sthapana diwas main hissaa lene ke liye pahunche to surakshabalon ne iskaa udhaaharan bhi diya
 a mock drill showed the security forces to deal with any crisis
 yahaan mock drill main dikhaaya gaya ki agar koi netaa raily ko sambodhit kar rahaa he or usee samay raily main koi hamalaa hota he to us dauraan surakshabal kis tarah netaa ko bachaate hue, janata ko surakshit rakhte hue vahaan kaise hamalaavaron ko karaara jawaab dete hai
 Since, in this type of situation, it would be necessary to first remove the person sitting in the post so that the situation does not get much worse
 mock drill main dikhaaya gaya he ki surakshabal lagaataar ho rahe dhamaake or golibari ke bich netaa ko surakshit us sthaan se nikaalte hai

 Kapil Mishra told that till now people had to gather in one place in the slum hut and fill tap water
 lekin ab lagbhag 500 ke aasapaas jhuggi ko line daalkar pani kaa conection denge
 However, the question also arises that the amount of water that the Jal Board produces in the recent past is not enough for the consumption of the whole
 aise main pani ke nae conection dene ke baad, sarkaar pipeline ke liye pani kahaan se laaegi?gaanv main mil rahaa conectionsarkaar ne elaan kiya he ki jin gaanv main malikana haq na hone kii vajah se logon ko pani kaa conection nahin mil paa rahaa tha, unhen khasra yaa idi dikhaa ke bhi gaanv main conection milegaa
 Apart from this, water connections can be given to the tenants living in DDA flats and other houses by showing ID

 Due to this scheme, people have to deposit only the principal amount
 commercial conection waalon ko milegi rahatjal mantri kapil mishra ne bataaya ki dilli main commercial conection kaa lagbhag 1100 karod kaa bill jal board maaf karegaa
 There are thousands of commercial connections in Delhi and the balance of around 1900 crores is above the Jal Board

 This will provide relief to those who were hanging the sword of illegal connection due to non-payment of bills
 kapil mishra ne aage kaha ki sainkadon chote hotel or restaurent waalon ke siver conection ke commercial charge atake hue the or let pement lag rahaa tha
 All of them have also waived their outstanding payment surcharge
 isse pahadganj ke chote hotel or restaurent ko raahat milegi

 There will be a production of 16 MW
 dilli jal board kaa zyada kharch bijli main hota he
 a bill of about 500 crores comes for electricity
 hamen 8 rupee 50 paise prati unit bijli milti he
 But solar production will get 4 rupees 94 paise electricity per unit for the next 25 years
 aage kapil ne kaha ki isse na hing lagegi, na fitkaree or rang bhi chokha rahegaa
 The Water Board, which has held 128 meetings during the Aam Aadmi Party government, said that 81 water bodies have been identified in Delhi
 in water body ke vikaas ke liye 3 excutive ejeeniyar kaam karenge

 After the completion of one year of the Yogi government in Uttar Pradesh, now the first reshuffle in the cabinet is going to take place
 19 march ko sarkaar kii pehali saalagirah ke baad yah ahm badlaav hoga
 According to the information quoted by sources, Yogi will have his first cabinet expansion after BJP President Amit Shah's visit to UP on April 10
 is vistaar main kai mantriyon kii chuttee ho sakati he
 Mayawati's target on the Yogi government said, 'one year, bad example', if sources are to be believed, BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi can be included in the cabinet in the Yogi government
 is pherbadal main kuch varisht mantriyon ko sanghathan kii jimmedaari saunpi ja sakati he
 The 'apna Dal' is also unhappy with the Yogi government, may go to the Rajya Sabha against the BJP The first anniversary of the BJP government in the state was not spectacular, on the anniversary day, one of his ministers OP Rajbhar raised the flag of revolt
 uske baad anya sahyogi dalon ne bhi rajya sarkaar ke saath apni naaraazgi jaahir kii
 These 10 decisions of the Modi government have increased the challenges of the Yogi government
 On the other hand, in the by-elections in up's 2 high profile seats (gorakhpur and Phulpur), the BJP had to face a crushing defeat
 gorakhpur mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kaa garh he or rajya kii kaman sanbhaalane se pehle vah yaheen se saansad rahe
 The initial trends clearly show that the Modi wave has once again worked in UP
 holi se pehle bhagava rang pradesh kii sadakon par najar aane laga he
 Looking at the results of the early counting of votes, people are reminded of the elections held in 1980
 1980 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main 309 siten mili thim
 At that time there were a total of 425 assembly seats in UP
 khaas baat yah thi ki bijepi ko mahaj 11 siton se hi santosh karnaa padaa tha
 The second largest party was Chaudhary Charan Singh's Janata Party Secular (JNP (SC)), winning them a total of 59 seats
 taaja aankadon ke mutabik 403 siton kii vidhansabha membijapi280 se adhik siton par badhat bana chuki he
 The ruling party Samajwadi Party and Congress combine is around 75 and BSP on 25 seats
 ab sabhi ko intjaar parinaamon kaa he
 It remains to be seen whether the BJP can break the old Congress record this time
 haalanki bijepi karyaalay main subah se hi josh kaa maahaul he or jashn manaaya ja rahaa he
 Let me tell you that it was the eighth assembly of UP and this is the picture of the 17th assembly of UP
 1980 main congress kii ore se swargeey vishwanath pratap singh kii tajposhi hui thi
 It is now to see whose head will be crowned by the BJP this time
 bijepi pradesh adhyaksh sahit sabhi bade netaa kah chuke hai kiyupi kaa siemcheharaa sansadeey board kii baithak main tay kiya jayega

 Since the results of the Maharashtra assembly elections on October 24, there has been a tussle between BJP and Shiv Sena regarding the 50-50 formula and due to this, a new government has not been formed in the state yet

 The Dalai Lama said that people in India have started to believe that corruption has become a part of life and they have reached this conclusion after talking to students and businessmen
 unhone kaha, kai logon ko anna ke tareekon ko lekar thodi bahut aapattiyaan hai lekin prerana bahut jaruri he
 People have started thinking that corruption is a part of life
 yah andolan raashtra or rajanetaaon ko sahi myanon main yaad dilaataa he ki bhrashtachar puri tarah galat cheez he

 The matter has reached the Supreme Court and the court overturned the government's decision
 in ghatnaon se nishchit taur par sibiai kii saakh par batta laga he
 In fact, on 23 October 2018, the Modi government sent CBI Chief Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana on leave on charges of corruption and appointed Nageswara Rao as the interim director of the CBI
 lekin supreme court ne alok verma kii yachika par faisla sunaate hue sarkaar ke faisle ko galat tehra diya or sibiai chif kaa charge turant verma ko saunpane kaa aadesh diya
 But then on January 10, the high-level selection committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed Alok Verma from the post of CBI director and re-appointed Nageswara Rao as the interim director
 is faisle ke khilaaf bhi supreme court main yachika di gai he
 Let me tell you, the CBI is one such investigating agency in the country, which the public always wants to see objectively
 lekin pichley dinon jo kuch hua he usase sibiai ko lekar logon ke man main kai tarah ke sawaal hai
 'aaj Tak' in association with Karvy Insights conducted a survey on the credibility of CBI
 survey main logon se poocha gaya ki pichley dinon is sanstha ke andar jo kuch hua uske baad bhi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sibiai kii jaanch par aaj aapako bharosa he?survey main sidhe 12 fisadi logon ne jawaab diya ki ab use sibiai kii jaanch par bilkul bharosa nahin he
 Whereas 31 per cent said that now trust in CBI has reduced after looking at the events of the past
 jabaki 41 fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki sibiai main uthapatak ke baad ab is agency par or vishwaas bad gaya he
 16 per cent people kept silence on this question or refused to say anything
 survey main ek tarah se sibiai main vivaad ke baad 43 fisadi logon kaa vishwaas is agency ko lekar diga he
 However, 41 per cent people say that the CBI will now more vigorously investigate corruption cases
 yah survey janvari 2019 ko kiya he
