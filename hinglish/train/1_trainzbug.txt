 - arjun rampal (@rampalarjun) March 16, 2018REVIEW: Ajay Devgan's Raid, directed by Rajkumar Gupta, features Ajay Devgan as the Income Tax Officer in Raid, directed by Rajkumar Gupta
 film main eliana decruige unki patni kaa role adaa kar rahi hai
 The film also features actors like Saurabh Shukla, Amit Sayal, Pushpa Joshi
 kya he film kii kahani:red film saal 1981 main uttar pradesh ke lakhanu shahar main hui ek ghatana par besd he
 In this city, the Income Tax Department transfers officer Amay Patnaik (ajay Devgan)
 wo apni patni malini patnayak (eliana decruige) ke saath yahaan aate hai
 His subordinate Lallan (amit Sayal) and others work in the department
 jab amay ko pataa chalata he ki rameshwar singh urf taoojee (saurabh shukla) ne apane ghar bahut paisa chupaaya he to wo apni team ke saath unke ghar red maarane jate hai
 This is followed by a lot of twists and turns in the film and several events unfold one after the other
 aaj shanivaar ko champions trophy main pakistan apni naak bachaane ke liye bharat ke saamne utrega, lekin isse pehle hi purv tej gendbaaj shoeb akhtar ne aisa bayaan diya he jo pakistani team kaa manobal gira saktaa he
 This statement has come when the Pakistani team has already been eliminated from the tournament after losing two matches
 pakistan ke purv tej gendbaaj shoeb akhtar ne desh kii cricket vyavastha ke khilaaf kadaa ravaiya jari rakhte hue kaha ki pakistani team ke adhiktar khilaadi maansik rup se pareshaan hai
 Akhtar said, 'most players are not able to perform on the field, why? Because they are mentally disturbed
 unhen kai tarah ke dar he
 That fear has to be removed and it is the coach's job
 coach ko kaam khel sikhaanaa nahin he
 He said that Pakistan cricket is going through a 'dark age'
 akhtar ne champions trophy main team ke lachar pradarshan ke baad yah kadi tippanee kii he
 He said that due to poor coaching, batsmen are not able to perform well and the Pakistani team needs a new coach
 team india ne badi hi ummiido ke saath yuva ballebaaj or wicketiper rishabh pant ko world cap kii apni team main shaamil kiya tha
 The Delhi batsman was given a place in the team in place of opener Shikhar Dhawan in the World Cup, but Pant once again failed to meet the expectations of the team and the selectors and was dismissed for 32 against New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final
 went
 pant aise samay out hue jab team ko unki sabase zyada jarrut thi, lekin apni aadat se majaboor rishabh pant ek baar phir tikne ke baad lanbaa shot khilne ke chakkar main apana wicket de baithe
 Looking at Rishabh's batting, it seems that he does not even know the value of his wicket
 kya wo ye samajhate hai ki unhen 30 se 40 ran banane ke liye team main shaamil kiya gaya he
 If they think so, then they are completely wrong, because from the number 4 where they come to bat, the player either wins the team or brings the team to the threshold of victory and Pant leaves the team in trouble
 The pavilion went away
 ipel mod se nahin nikle pantvanade cricket main teen or chaar number par ahm ballebaajon ko mauka diya jaataa he jo ballebaaji kii ridh kehalaate hai
 Looking at Rishabh Pant's game, it seems that he has not been able to get out of IPL mode
 ipel main rishabh pant kii tej ballebaaji kii kaaphi tarif hui thi, jahaan teji se banaae gaye 30-40 ran match kaa pasa palat dete hai
 In one-day cricket, when the team needed reliable batting, Pant returned at the same time
 dhoni ke baad koun, sawaal ab bhi bakipant ke saath hi yah team management ke liye bhi yah chintaa or aatmamanthan kaa mudda hona chahie ki unhen maujuuda wicketiper mahendra singh dhoni ke riplacement ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Dhoni has won many matches to the team
 unhen mushkil paristhitiyon main shant hokar ballebaaji karne or anukool paristhitiyon main aakraamak ballebaaji ke liye janaa jaataa rahaa he
 With the technique of bat and keeping, Dhoni went on to captain the team
 apane maujuuda khel se pant kahin bhi dhoni ke riplacement najar nahin aa rahe hai
 SANTNER GETS THE BREAKTHROUGH! In his first over, Rishabh Pant looks to go big and picks out Colin de Grandhomme on the midwicket rope
 India are 71 / 5, and their recovery has hit a stumbling block
 In comes MS Dhoni

 com / yjnfxude0d— Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup) July 10, 2019 Constantly getting out from 30 to 40, Pant's luck was that he was included in the World Cup squad after Shikhar Dhawan was injured
 unki is acchhee kismat kaa silsilaa yaheen nahin thama
 After this, when Team India all-rounder Vijay Shankar was injured, he got a place in the last eleven against England
 pant ne is match main 32 ran kii pari kheli or iske baad bangladesh ke khilaaf match main wo 48 ran banaakar out ho gaye
 At the same time, in his third match, he returned to the pavilion by making just 4 in front of the Sri Lankan team
 pant kii naakaami kaa silsilaa semifinal main bhi jari rahaa or ek baar phir wicket par samay bitaane ke baad apana wicket de baithe
 Did Pant finish Rayudu's career? After Rishabh Pant and Mayank Agarwal were included in the team after the injury of Dhawan and later Vijay Shankar, Ambati Rayudu announced his retirement from international cricket
 
 pichley 4 saal se number 4 kii ladaai main shaamil rahe raidu ko jab vijay shankar ke ghayal hone ke baad bhi team main shaamil nahin kiya gaya to ise unhen gaharaa jhatka laga
 After batting Pant first at number four, coach Shastri and captain Kohli hit water at Rayudu's expectations
 Then after Manik Agarwal was given a place in the World Cup squad, Rayudu gave up hope of playing for Team India and cricket Announced his retirement from aise main dekha jaae to pant ke chayan par naa sirf sawaal khadey ho rahe hai, balki is khilaadi ne ek tarah se ambati raidu ke kariyar ko bhi khatm kar diya

 pakistan main 25 july ko aam chunaav hone ja rahe hai
 All parties are working hard to appeal to the public to vote in the elections
 lekin in dinon pakistan chunaav prachaar kaa ek poster kaaphi surkhiyaan bator rahaa he
 Actually, this poster belongs to cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan's "pakistan tehreek-e-insaf"
 pitiai ummidavaar ke is poster main ummidavaar ke saath-saath bollywood ke do bade star amitabh bachchan or maadhuri dikshit kii bhi tasviir dikh rahi he
 Now the question arises that why the picture of Amitabh Bachchan and Madhuri Dixit has been installed in the general election of Pakistan? We decided to do a viral test
 sabase pehle jaaniye kya he poster mempitiai ke ummidavaar ne maadhuri dikshit or amitabh bachchan kii tasveeron kaa istemaal apane poster par kiya he
 Two more pictures are on the poster
 in tasveeron ke neeche sardaar abbaas dogar or sardaar ovais dogar likhaa hua he
 Probably Sardar Abbas Dogar is the name of the candidate because the second picture is of a child whose name is written as Sardar Owais Dogar
 poster par iske alaava party kaa chunaav chinh "balla" kaa nishaan bhi he
 At the top of the poster, there is something written in Urdu, which means - "I am not inclined, i do not sell, i am not hiding anywhere! i am in the battlefield which is stuck! Find me in those people 
 " soshal media par viral ho rahi is tasviir ko pakistan ke shahar multan kaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 People are also reacting to this on Twitter

 com / lxwfk70dqk — Naila Inayat (@nailainayat) July 22, 2018 There is a question whether such a copster is actually being used by any party in Pakistan
 isko lekar hamane sabase pehle pakistan ke shahar multan kaa rukh kiya
 Since the poster was linked to Imran Khan's party, we investigated whether a Sardar of this party named Abbas Dogar is associated with this party
 padtaal karne par pataa chalaa ki multan main pitiai party ke kul 14 ummidavaar chunavi maidan main apana bhagya aajamaa rahe hai, lekin sardaar abbaas dogar naam se koi bhi vyakti chunaav nahin lard rahaa or na hi poster main dikhne vaala vyakti multan kaa he
 In this case, we spoke to the local journalist Nasir Zaheer of Today News, he also said that the election symbol in the poster is of PTI but no candidate of this party in Multan is in the name of Sardar Abbas Dogar nor The picture printed on the poster is of a candidate
 unhone aage bataaya ki pakistan main ummidavaar apane poster binar main tasviir, chunaav chinh ke alaava chunaav ayog ke dwaara diya gaya number bhi ankit karte hai, jo is viral tasviir par nahin he
 But it may be that the viral picture may not be of Multan but of any other constituency in Pakistan
 isliye hamane yah pataa lagane kii koshish kii ki agar tasviir main dikhne vaala shaks multan kaa nahin he to kahaan kaa he?juthi sabit hui khabaib hamane isko lekar "pakistan taharik-e-insaaf" party ke antarashtriya media head anila khwaja se baat kii to unhone bataaya ki tasviir main dikhne vaala shaks pitiai main nahin he or na hi pakistan main yah kahin se chunaav lard rahaa he
 Anila also said that hundreds of such posters are on the streets of Pakistan to malign PTI
 ham isaki jaanch kar rahe hai ki koun log hai jo is tarah kii afvaah soshal media par failaa rahe hai
 In such a situation, this news proved to be false in the viral test
 viral ho rahi yah tasviir na to asli he or chhamitabh bachchanaur maadhuri dikshit kaa koi sambandh pakistan main hone vaale chunaav se he

 Regarding Junaid's film journey, he said, 'junaid wants to work in films and wants to direct films
 maine use chetaya bhi he ki usne mushkil rasta chunaa he kyonki uski hameshaa mujhase tulana hoti rahegi
 i also told him, if you are not good at acting, then i will tell you on the face and i will not be able to do anything to support you because i think it will not be right for that film and for the audience
 ' So first of all, devotees sing together and accompany Manjire

 com / nfuzwlg85l At the end of the Lok Sabha elections, now the Bharatiya Janata Party has started preparing for the assembly elections to be held in the state
 party kii najar ab dilli par bhi he
 If sources are to be believed, as part of its strategy, BJP has decided that it will not give assembly tickets to the leaders and district heads who are responsible in the state organization
 aisa isliye taaki vah netaa sanghathan main badi jimmedaari nibhaa sake or sirf apane hi chunaav main naa vyast rahe
 Earlier in the 2017 MCD election, BJP did something similar and did not give tickets to the sitting councilors
 kyonki un sabhi ke khilaaf janata main naaraazgi kii khabaren thim
 BJP has been out of power in the state for the last 22 years, so this time it is busy preparing for the election
 gauratlab he ki bhaajapa aksar ek vyakti ek pad kii niti par chalati rahi he
 However, the party's national president Amit Shah is currently the country's home minister as well as the BJP chief
 bijepi sutron kii maane to vidhansabha chunaav ke najadik aate hi jila adhyakshon, padaadhikariyon kaa tikat maangane kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya he
 In such a situation, he should not be busy in his own election and the organization may suffer loss, so such a decision can be taken
 tikat dene main party is baar un logon ko mauka de sakati he jo lagaataar jameen par rahakar kaam kar rahe hai or jinke chunaav jeetne kii sambhaavnaaen adhik hai
 The same thing happened during the Lok Sabha elections
 jisamen netaa party main pad ke badale loksabhaa tikat kii maang kar rahe the
 Now, if sources are to be believed, the party believes that if the posts and tickets are found together in the organization, then the party itself may suffer
 haalanki, jab pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari se is par sawaal poocha gaya to unhone is tarah kii khabaron ko galat bataaya
 a survey will also be conducted by BJP in Delhi around November
 ek taraf jahaan bhaajapa main baithkon kaa daur chalaa he, to vahiin sadsyta abhiyaan kii bhi taiyaariyaan tej ho gai hai
 Which will start from July 6
 gauratlab he ki dilli main agle saal farvari main vidhansabha chunaav ho sakate hai
 In the last election, the AAP had won 67 seats out of 70, while the BJP had won only 3 seats
 rajasthan vidhaan sabha main netaa pratipaksh vasundhara raaje ne shuukravaar ko bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh kaa kaarybhaar sambhaal liya
 At the BJP State Headquarters, Raje held BJP state in-charge Captain Singh Solanki, co-secretary Kirit Sommaya, MP Om Prakash Mathur, former MP Ram Das Aggarwal, former BJP state president Dr
 arun chaturvedi, purv grahamantri gulab chand kataaria, purv mantri ghanashyam tiwadi samet kai varisht netaaon or sainkadon kaaryakartaaon or samarthakon kii maujuudagi main pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh kaa kaarybhaar grahan kiya
 After assuming office, Raje said that she will work with everyone and the rule of the people will come again
 dilli kii ek adaalat ne pakistani khufia adhikariyon ko kathith rup se gopneey soochna pradaan karne ke liye giraftaar rajanyik maadhuri gupta kii nyaayik hiraasat shanivaar ko 14 din ke liye badha di
 The court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Kaveri Baweja sent Gupta (53) to judicial custody till July 9
 use shanivaar ko adaalat main pesh kiya gaya tha
 Earlier on May 31, his judicial custody was extended
 dilli police ne gupta ko islamabad se aane ke baad 22 april ko giraftaar kar liya tha
 He was called from Islamabad
 vah vahaan press evam soochna shakha main dwitiya sachiv thi

 samaajawaadee party (sapa) pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ke istife ke baad khaali hui mainpuri loksabhaa seat par ho rahe upachunaav main dobaaraa jeet ko lekar ek taraf jahaan sapa aashwast dikh rahi he, vahiin duusari ore bhartiya janata party (bijepi) sapa ke garh main send lagane kii kavayad main juty hui he
 The by-election for Mainpuri parliamentary seat is to be held on 13 September along with 11 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh
 mainpuri sansadeey seat par ho rahe upachunaav main mulaayam ne apane bade bhai ke pautra tej pratap yadav ko maidan main utaara he
 Earlier, Mulayam made his daughter-in-law and Dimple Yadav, wife of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, enter politics
 ab vah upachunaav ke madhyam se hi teesri peedi ko maidan main utaar chuke hai
 Tej Pratap Yadav is currently the block chief of the SP
 tej pratap ko jitaane ke liye sapa ke diggaj netaa mainpuri main deraa daal chuke hai
 Shivpal Yadav is continuously in Mainpuri, while Mulayam Singh will finalize the election strategy by staying in Mainpuri for two days on 6 and 7 September
 sapa netaa dow seepi raay ne kaha, "mainpuri kaa upachunaav ekatarfa sapa ke paksh main rahegaa
 Modi's drum will not be played here
 aap dekhie ki aam chunaav se pehle inke liye mahangaai, kalaadhan or bhrashtachar mukhya mudda tha, lekin satta main aate hi inke mudde bhi badal gaye hai
 " idhar, bijepi kii ore se prem singh shakya mainpuri se ummidavaar hai
 The BJP hopes that with the credibility of Narendra Modi, it will be able to make a dent in Mulayam's stronghold
 upachunaav main prachaar kii kaman varisht netaa or kendriya mantri calraj mishra, gorakhpur se saansad yogi adityanath or pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi ke haathon main he
 BJP State Spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak says, "not only will the central issues dominate in the by-elections, there is also a fight against misrule here
 is baar yahaan ladaai kaante kii hogi or hamen puraa bharosa he ki bijepi sapa ke garh main send lagane main kaamyaab rahegi
 " abhi kuch dinon pehle to khabar aa rahi thi ki actress vidya baalan pregnent hai
 But now there is talk of their marriage being in trouble
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vidya baalan or unke produsar pati siddharth roy kapur ke bich sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 The reason for this is a new actress, with whom Vidya is angry due to Siddharth's closeness
 pregnancy kii khabar ko to vidya baalan ne ek bayaan ke jariye khaarij kar diya
 But they have kept silence on this separation
 angreji akhbaar deccan chronical main chhapi khabar ke mutabik siddharth roy kapur ek nai actress ko jor shor se pramot karne main lage hai
 Vidya is not at all happy with this attitude of Patidev
 isi ke chalate unhone apane tamaam videshi daure bhi cancil kar die hai
 The entire industry went to the US for the IIFA Award, but Vidya did not move from Mumbai
 khabar he ki vidya siddharth par najar rakhane ke liye yah sab kar rahi hai
 According to the newspaper, Siddharth had gone close to another actress after marriage
 yah tab hua jab vidya shoot ke silsile main praayah desh ke baahar hoti thim
 It is being told that due to all this, there are constant fights between Vidya and Siddharth
 inhen ke chalate vidya baalan kii agali film bobi jasoos ke pramotion main bhi deree ho rahi he
 Vidya has also been visiting her parents' home in Chembur frequently for the past few weeks
 actress ke kareebi logon kaa kahana he ki apni shaadi bachaane ke liye vidya har mumkin koshish karegi
 This is Siddharth Roy Kapoor's third marriage
 unki pehali shaadi bachapan kii muhabbat se hui thi
 The second wife worked as a producer
 unka talaak 2011 main hua tha
 Delhi remained completely closed on 13 March in protest against sealing in the capital
 chote-bade tamaam vyapaaree sanghathanon ne band main saath diya or kareeb 7 lakh vyapaariyon ne dukaanon ke shater nahin khole
 Due to this shutdown, the government has incurred a loss of crores of revenue as well as loss of shopkeepers in lakhs
 is band kii vajah se rickshawvaale or auto waalon ko bhi kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Today, auto rickshaw drivers who take passengers from markets to markets are sitting empty
 subah se hi inaki bohani nahin hui he, jisase yah bhi centre sarkaar or rajya sarkaar se kaaphi khafa hai
 Lajpat Nagar market, one of Delhi's most crowded markets, is also completely closed today
 yah bazaar hajaaron rickshaw or auto chaalkon kii roji roti kaa saadhan he or band ke chalate inaki aamadani na ke baraabar he
 Manmohan, who has been driving a rickshaw outside Lajpat Nagar for nearly 12 years, says that the government never listens to the poor
 ham roj kamaane khaane vaale hai
 Today not a single ride has been found since morning
 lagata nahin ki shaam tak bhi koi milegi
 Will have to go home empty handed today
 kaise roti banegi nahin pataa
 The government should think about us
 bazaaron ko sil nahin karnaa chahie is par ham bhi nirbhar hai
 Amar Colony Market is also closed due to sealing
 yahaan par bhi rickshaw or auto chaalkon ko sidhaa nuksaan pahunchaa he
 It has been almost 1 week since the bandh, which has affected even a small rickshawala who earns 5 to 6 hundred rupees daily
 saalon se yahaan kii dukaanon se maal dhulaai kaa kaam karne vaale rakesh kaa kahana he, 'ham yahaan se maal dhone kaa kaam kar rahe the
 i used to get a lot of income, with the help of which i bought a house by taking a loan
 ab 1 hafte ho gaye hai or band kii vajah se aamadani ghat ke aadhi rah gai he
 Can't understand how to loan, how to pay children's fees
 sarkaar se bhi koi ummid nahin he
 Some similar situations remain in the Sadar Bazar of Delhi
 yahaan thele vaale auto vaale or rickshaw vaale pichley 40 din se pareshaaniyaan jhel rahe hai
 Their work has halved since the sealing in Sadar Bazar last month
 kuch to yahaan se duusari jagah shift ho gaye hai
 Because work is non-existent
 kul milakar dilli main ceiling ke chalate jitna nuksaan dukandaaron, kamgaaron or dihadi mazdooron ko ho rahaa he usase kahin zyada pareshaaniyaan auto or rickshaw chaalkon ko ho rahi hai
 Muslims from all over the world visit Saudi Arabia every year for Hajj
 saudi sarkaar bharat ko musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke anupaat main ek nirdhaarit kota detii hai jise centre sarkaar rajya sarkaron ko aavantit karti he
 Usually this work is done by the State Haj Committee of the concerned state through Central Haj Committee, Mumbai
 centre sarkaar bhartiya musalamaanon ko haj yatra par sabsidi detii rahi he, lekin modi sarkaar ne aaj ise khatm kar diya he
 In such a situation, the question arises, what is the Haj subsidy? Like the Muslims of the world, the Muslims of India also go to Saudi Arabia for Haj
 bhartiya hajiyon kii yatra ke kharch kaa kuch hissaa sarkaar sabsidi ke rup main khud vahan karti he
 The subsidy is available only to those Haj pilgrims who go through the Haj Committee
 baaki jo privet tour sarvice ke jariye jate hai unhen kisi tarah kii sabsidi nahin di jaati he
 In fact, the largest part of the subsidy for Haj pilgrims is spent on air travel
 bharat sarkaar kaa civil aviation mantralay haj cameti of india ke jariye ye sabsidi muhaiyaa karaata he
 This money is given directly to Air India instead of Haj pilgrims
 bharat main haj sabsidi lagbhag 650 karod rupee he
 These are usually offered as air fares to Saudi Arabia
 musalamaanon kaa yahi maananaa he ki sabsidi airlines ko di ja rahi hai na ki unako
 Haj pilgrims get the opportunity to travel in two categories
 pehali green category or duusari ajijia category
 The cost of Haj pilgrimage last year (2016) was as follows
 green catagorimakka main rukne kaa kharch 81,000 rupemadina main rukne kaa kharch 9,000 rupeeirlines kaa tikat 45,000 rupayeenya kharch 76,320 rupekul kharch 21,1320 rupayijijia catagorimakka main rukne kaa kharch 47,340 rupemadina main rukne kaa kharch 9,000 rupeeirlines kaa tikat 45,000 rupayeenya kharch 76,320 rupekul kharch 17,7660 rupayeeb sara khel airlines ke tikat kaa he, jiske liye haj yatriyon se 45,000 rupee liye jate hai
 Officially the airline's arrival ticket is said to be Rs 70,340, in which only 45000 have to be paid to the passenger, the rest is paid by the government directly to the airlines
 yahaan bhi ek ganit he
 That is, if you leave for Haj from Odisha or Goa or go to Chennai instead of Delhi, then its ticket cost will also be different
 bataa den ki supreme court ne sarkaar dwaara haj yatra ke liye di jane vaali sabsidi kii aalochana kii thi or ise khatm karne ko kaha tha
 The court ordered it to be scrapped gradually within a time limit of 10 years
 2006 se hi videsh mantralay or parivahan or paryaton par bani ek sansadeey samiti ne haj sabsidi ko ek samay seemaa ke bheetar khatm karne ke suzav die the
 The High Level Committee to set up the Haj policy for the next five years had also advocated the abolition of subsidy, which has now been approved
 kanoon mantri salmaan khurshid or unke trust se judaa ek or maamla saamne aayaa he
 Khurshid has been accused by a person from Farrukhabad that 25 acres of land he had leased to plant the plant was given to Khurshid's trust overnight
 tippaniyan He also planted about three thousand saplings on this land, but in 1995 the lease of this land was given to Salman Khurshid's trust at the rate of Rs 100
 tab se is jameen par aspataal kaa nirmaan kaary chal rahaa he jo ki abhi tak bhi puraa nahin ho paaya he
 According to Mujib Khan, there may be many disturbances behind this hospital being built for the last 17 years, which should be examined objectively
 is jameen par unhone kareeb teen hajaar paudhe bhi lagaae, lekin 1995 main is jameen kii lij 100 rupee salanaa kii dar se salmaan khurshid ke trust ko de di gai
 Since then, construction work of the hospital is going on on this land, which has not yet been completed
 mujeeb khan ke mutabik, pichley 17 saalon se ban rahe is aspataal ke peeche kai gadabadi ho sakati hai, jinaki nishpaksh jaanch honi chahie
 According to Mujib Khan, there may be many disturbances behind this hospital being built for the last 17 years, which should be examined objectively
 unhone kaha, "hamaare paas bazaar maujuud he, or agar ham kisi acchhee kahani ke bina film bana daalate hai, to vah eemaandaarana film nirmaan nahin kehalaayegaa
 
 
 But who knows, if my father writes a good story, like he had written before, then no one will stop us
 
 
 ham kabhi bhi use bana sakate hai
 
 
 " 'bahubali' series kii donon filmon kii patakatha rajamauli ke pita vijayendra prasad dwaara likhi kahani par aadhaarit he, or hindi filmon ke superstar salmaan khan kii superhit film 'bajrangi bhaijan' kii kahani bhi vijayendra prasad ne hi likhi thi
 
 
 The script of both the films of 'bahubali' series is based on the story written by Rajendrauli's father Vijayendra Prasad, and the story of Hindi film superstar Salman Khan's superhit film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' was also written by Vijayendra Prasad
 
 
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne buudhvaar ko loksabhaa main raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav ke dauraan bhaashan diya
 In one and a half hour speech, PM Modi attacked the Congress fiercely
 piem ke bhaashan shuru karne se pehle hi congress or centre sarkaar main bijepi kii sahyogi telegu desham party sadan main narebaaji kar rahi thi
 These slogans continued throughout the speech
 congress saansad ranjit ranjan bhi piem modi ke khilaaf naare lagane main sabase aage raheen
 Talking to Aaj Tak, he said that PM Modi has given water to people in the last four years, now we will take them to the polls by giving them water
 unhone kaha ki piem ke is bhaashan ko puraa desh sun rahaa tha, hamane sadan main logon kii baat uthaai thi
 People no longer want to hear jumle
 jab hamane pradhanmantri ke khilaaf naare lagaae to is baar sattapaksh kaa koi bhi mantri nahin uthaa
 Are PM mps also angry with him: Ranjita Ranjan, Congress MP Report: @ Supriya23bh # reporterdiarypic
 twitter
 com / a2txyvfqga - Aaj Tak (@aajtak) February 7, 2018 Ranjan said that while we were shouting slogans against PM Modi, we got the full support of Congress President Rahul Gandhi and former President Sonia Gandhi
 lekin is dauraan piem modi ke samarthan main koi bhi bijepi saansad nahin bolaa
 This means that BJP mps are also angry with PM Modi
 ranjit ranjan ne ajtak se baatcheet main ye bhi bataaya ki unhone sadan main piem modi ke khilaaf kis tarah ke naare lagaae
 Jumle will not run, speech will not run, drama will not work, what happened to the Rafael deal, what happened to corruption, what happened to black money, Rahul also spoke to the media on warpm's speech and said that we all Wanted to hear his speech, we have many questions in which the issue of Andhra Pradesh was and the Rafale Deal issue
 rafel deal main kuch naa kuch to galat hua he
 Rahul said that PM spoke more than 1 hour in Lok Sabha but did not say anything on Rafael Deal
 rahul ne kaha ki piem ne loksabhaa main campan spich kii or kuch nahin kiya
 It is worth mentioning that on Thursday also, the opposition made tremendous mobilization against the old 500-1000 rupee demonetization decision, and informed the government about the problems being faced by the poor sections of the society
 iske saath hi vipaksh ne is faisle ko sarkaar kii taraf se pehle hi apane chaheton ko li karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Meanwhile, several senior Union ministers rejected the allegations of opposition and asked the opposition whether they want to get freedom from black money or not
 is bich kai varisht kendriya mantriyo ne vipaksh ke in aaropon ko sire se nakaarte hue vipaksh se poocha ki kya ve kaale-dhan se aazaadee paanaa chaahate hai yaa nahin
 Opposition parties have started targeting him on the statement of RSS propaganda chief Manmohan Vaidya to end reservations
 bahujan samaaj party kii rashtriya adhyaksh mayawati ne vaidya ke bayaan kii tikhi aalochana karte hue kaha ki samvidhan va deshhit main aresas ko apni galat va jativaadee maansikta badalane kii sakht jarurat he
 At the same time, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad was furious at the statement made by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) propaganda head Manmohan Vaidya that the constitution has given reservations, the RSS did not have enough courage to snatch it
 lalu ne shuukravaar ko twit kiya, "aarakshan samvidhan pradutt adhikaar he
 Not a bailout of a casteist organization like RSS
 ise chhinane kii baat karne waalon ko aukaat main laana kamjor virgo ko aata he
 " lalu ne centre main sattarudh bhaajapa ke maardarshak sanghathan aresas par sawaal khadaa karte hue ek anya twit main likhaa, "aresas pehle apane ghar main lagu 100 fisadi aarakshan kii samiksha kare
 Why have no non-upper castes, backward, Dalits or women become Union heads till date? let's talk!" purv kendriya mantri yaheen nahin ruke, unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue or bihar vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa kii haar kii yaad dilaate hue aage likhaa, "modi ji, aapke aresas pravaktaa aarakshan par phir ant-shant bake hai
 Bihar washes by rubbing, perhaps some washing was left which UP will now do fiercely
 "tippaniyan It is noteworthy that at the Jaipur Literature Festival, RSS propaganda head Manmohan Vaidya has said that 'people have been kept aside for hundreds of years in the name of reservation
 ise khatm karne kii jimmedaari hamaari he
 'they have said that reservation has to be abolished, because it has given rise to' separatism '
 gauratlab he ki bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke samay purv sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne aarakshan ko khatm karne ko lekar bayaan diya tha
 After this, JD (U) and RJD took up the matter loudly in the election meetings, which also gave them the benefit of elections
 modi ne kaha tha, "aarakshan ko bachaane ke liye ji-jaan laga duungaa
 "but voters did not trust his word
 lalu ne shuukravaar ko twit kiya, "aarakshan samvidhan pradutt adhikaar he

 (NVVN) had to sell electricity at a price much lower than the price recorded in the contract
 araraisiel ne 7 janvari ko ek or 9 janvari ko teen kamishning certificate jari kiye
 Having mistakenly assumed that the last date for completion of the projects is January 10, he issued three more certificates on that day
 lekin farvari ke shuru hone tak bijli utpaadan kaa kahin namonishaan tak nahin tha
 Several boxes of devices had recently arrived on which the date of sending was written on 23 and 29 January

 Open wires of 1,000 solar power panels were dangling at the project site in Escandra
 india today 13 farvari ko saboot ke saath envivien adhikariyon se baat kii
 The officials admitted that they had taken the certificate at face value, hence no penalty
 envivien ne 19 farvari ko ek press vijyapti jari kii jisamen likhaa tha, ‘pehali baar 9 janvari kii antim taarikh biit jane par lanko kii teen companiyon or 11 anya ke 7 karod ru
 Has been roasted ’india today ne paaya ki lanko se judi jin teen companiyon ko dandit kiya tha, unhen 10 janvari ko certificate die gaye the
 But NVVN has not yet punished the other 4 companies linked to Lanco while it has evidence that they have only completed the January 9 deadline on paper
 ab araraisiel certificate se apana haath jhaadne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 He says that for him 'commissioning' means the right place of logistics for power generation, but it does not mean electricity generation

 vijayawargeey ne 19 farvari ko india today se kaha, ‘chunki hamen ab maaloom hua he ki sabhi panel nahin lage hai, isliye ham envivien ko suchit kar rahe hai ki ye aanshik kamishning certificate hai
 'but NVVN CEO Anil Aggarwal insists,' Commissioning means completion of the project and being ready for power generation
 ’lanko se judi 9 companiyon main se keval do uske swaamitv vaali hai
 Lanco has control over other companies through their shareholding pattern
 aisa enesaim niyamon ko taak par rakhkar kiya gaya tha
 According to these rules, a company can get only one contract

 In September 2011, he sought information about the shareholding pattern of companies getting solar power projects
 kendriya naveen evam akshay urja mantralay main sachiv girish bi
 Pradhan had ordered a three-member committee to conduct an inquiry on 3 February
 samiti, jisamen company maamalon ke kendriya mantralay main nideshak (jaanch) bhi shaamil the, ko yah jaanch kerani thi ki lanko ne 2010 main enesaim ke tahat 40 pratishat saura urja thekon ko paane ke liye apni do companiyon ke atirikt 7 front companiyon kaa istemaal kiya tha yaa nahin
 In the first phase of bidding under NSM, two Lanco-owned and 7 companies with its support were successful in getting 9 solar power projects
 india today ko pataa chalaa he ki thekon par in companiyon ke dastakhat karne ke baad lanko ne inamen 100 fisadi priferencial holding hasil kar lee
 This was a gross violation of NSM rules which prohibit any change in the shareholding pattern up to one year after the commencement of the project
 envivien kaa kahana he ki july, 2011 main companiyon kii closer shiton kii jaanch karte hue usne sharholding pattern main parivartan paaya
 He said, 'we sent notices to all nine Lanco companies for cancellation of contracts in August 2011
 disambar, 2011 tak maamla sulajh gaya kyonki lanko pareint companiyon ke swaamitv kii bahaali ke liye sahamat thi’
 India Today on visiting Escandra found that all the companies were operating under the same umbrella and located in the same place
 india today ne 9 farvari ko lanko ke paas ek prashnawali bheji thi
 Lanco replied on 16 February, 'the projects are connected to the grid and are generating electricity
 ’ usne yah bhi kaha ki us par jin companiyon kaa front ke rup main istemaal karne kaa aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he, unamem uske share jaij seemaa main hai
 India Today also sent a questionnaire to the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy
 mantralay ne 5 march ko bataaya ki prashnawali milane ke baad usne desh main sabhi saura pariyojnaon ke satyaapan ke liye ek team bhej di he
 In January, there was a dispute between the Chief Ministers of Rajasthan and Gujarat as to who was ahead in solar power generation
 pravasi bhartiya diwas ke dauraan 9 janvari ko gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne kaha ki unka rajya rajasthan se bahut aage he
 On the other hand, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot claimed on January 12 that his state would surpass Gujarat in terms of solar power generation
 lanko ke maamle ne gahalot ke daawey ko khokhla sabit kar diya he
 Perhaps Rajasthan fulfills its goals on paper

 This proves that such dahi improves the condition of diabetes patients

 There are many temples of Nagas in India, one of them is that of Nagachandreshwar in Ujjain, which is located in the city of Mahakal in Ujjain
 isaki khaas baat yah he ki yah mandir saal main sirf ek din nagpanchami (shravan shukla panchami) par hi darshanon ke liye kholaa jaataa he
 It is believed that Nagaraja Takshak himself lives in the temple

 manyata he ki uske baad se takshak raja ne prabhu ke saannnidhya main hi vaas karnaa shuru kar diya
 But before residing in the Mahakal forest, he had the intention that there should be no disturbance in his solitude, so over the years the practice is that he is available only on the day of Nagpanchami
 shesh samay unke sammaan main parampara ke anusaar mandir band rahata he
 After visiting this temple, the person is free from any kind of snakebite, so there are long queues of devotees outside this temple, which opens on the day of Nagpanchami
 do lakh se zyada bhakt karte hai nagdevataa ke darshanayah mandir kaaphi pracheen he
 It is believed that Parmar king Bhoj built this temple around 1050 AD

 agar aap bijepi ke kaaryakarta hai yaa uski vichaardhaara se sambandh rakhte hue har maheene party ke mukhpatr 'camel sandesh' kaa intjaar karte hai to ab aap aisa karnaa chhod dijie
 It is not closed like ordinary newspapers and magazines because of money straws, but because of its style and style, BJP President Amit Shah, who has a different identity, has decided to close it
 shah ne team chayan se lekar sansadeey board kaa sachiv niyukt karne, prabhaar baantne or prakoshthon ko vibhaag main tabdeel karne kaa faisla lekar yah to jataa hi diya tha kisanghathan main unki marji hi chalegi
 In keeping with this theme, he decided to discontinue the bjp's mouthpiece 'kamal Sandesh', which has been implemented with immediate effect
 is mukhpatr main bijepi kii sari gatividhi samet sanghathanaatmak pahal or nitigat maamalon par rukh ko kaaryakartaaon ko samajhane ke andaaj main parosa jaataa tha
 The current national vice president of BJP, Prabhat Jha, made this mouthpiece vocal as an editor
 ye he amit shah kii daleelsutron ke mutabik, shah ne ise band karne ke peeche party ke padaadhikariyon ko jo vajah bataai vah kuch netaaon ke gale to nahin utar rahi lekin shah ke faisle par ungali uthaane kii himakat koi nahin kar paa rahaa
 According to sources, Shah's argument about the closure of the mouthpiece 'kamal Sandesh' is that every state unit of the BJP also publishes a similar magazine, so there is no justification for printing it separately at the central level
 yani rajya ikaiyaan apana mukhpatr chhapati rahengi, lekin har rajya ikai ko centre se dizin kiya hua paanch panna anivaary rup se rajya bijepi ke mukhpatr main niyamit taur se chhapana hoga
 Prabhat Jha was removed and Shivshakti, who is working with Prabhat Jha to prepare this five page, is kept while Jha is relieved of responsibility

 In these five pages, every month, parts of biographies of two great men will be printed which are inspiring for the workers
 in mahapurushon main bijepi ke apane adarsh pan
 Biographies of other great men including Deendayal Upadhyay and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee will also be included
 shah ke is prayaas ko rajya ikai par centre kii pakad ko vaicharik taur se majboot banane kii disha main bhi ek prayaas ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Expressing happiness over the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the death sentence of terrorist Devendra Pal Singhbhullar, All India Anti Terrorist Front (AIATF) chairman Maninderjit Singh Bitta became emotional and during this time he fiercely whipped the Congress leaders
 bitta supreme court us faisle par apni pratikriya de rahe the jisamen aatankwaadi devendrapal singh bhullar kii faansee kii sajaa ko barkaraar rakhane kaa faisla diya gaya he
 Bhullar was convicted in the 1993 blast in Delhi
 is dhamaake main 9 logon kii maut ho gayi thi jabaki congress netaa emes bitta jakhmi ho gaye the
 Bitta targeted Kapil Sibal and Ambika Soni and also did not leave Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 haalanki bitta ne kaha ki gandhi parivaar kaa koi kasoor nahin tha
 Bitta was happy with the Supreme Court's decision and also started crying emotionally
 bitta ne bhullar ko sajaa milane main deree ke liye congressi netaaon ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 He said, 'I respect this decision and am very happy with it
 mere apane logon ne meraa saath chhod diya tha
 Targeting Kapil Sibal, Bitta asked, "why did Kapil Sibal fight Bhullar's case?" Accusing Ambika Soni, Bitta said, 'ambika Soni told me to keep quiet at the time of Afzal Guru's hanging
 'bhullar ne shila dikshit kii sarkaar par bhi bhullar ko bachaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Bitta said, 'sonia Gandhi did not give me time to meet
 ' gauratlab he ki 1993 main dilli main hue isi blast main bitta ghayal hue the
 Bitta said, "why was my security removed when i needed protection?" ' bitta ne kaha, 'ab main rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron ko bhi faansee par chadhate hue dekhnaa chahta hum
 Earlier, the Supreme Court turned down the mercy petition of terrorist Devendrapal Singh Bhullar
 bhullar 1993 main dilli main dhamaakaa karne kaa doshi paaya gaya tha
 9 people were killed in the blast, while Congress leader MS Bitta was injured
 saal 2003 main bhullar ne faansee kii sajaa paane ke baad raashtrapati ke paas dayaa yachika di thi
 This decision will have an impact on some other cases, including four of Rajiv Gandhi's killers
 bhagwaan shiv ko devon ke dev kaa kaha jaataa he
 One of the forms of Mahadev is that of Nataraja, while the other is of the great Mahayogi
 ye donon hi rup rahasyon se bhare hai, lekin shiv ko bholenath bhi kaha jaataa he
 Where there are so many colors together then why not take inspiration from these colors in your life
 1
 To eliminate evil: Brahma is known for genesis and Vishnu creation and Shiva for destruction
 shiv kaa yah rup aapako daraane vaala lag saktaa he lekin kisi buraai kaa khatm hona behad jaruri hota he
 Shiva is known for this
 2
 Remaining calm and controlling oneself: There is no yogi greater than Shiva
 kisi paristhiti se khud ko dur rakhte hue us par pakad rakhana aasaan nahin hota he
 Once Mahadev sits in meditation, the world may move from here, but no one can disturb his attention
 shiv kaa yah dhyaan hamen jivan kii chizon par niyantran rakhana sikhaati he
 3
 nakaaratmak chizon ko bhi sakaaratmak hokar lenaa:samudrmanthan se jab vish baahar aayaa to sabhi ne kadam peeche khinch liye the kyonki vish koi nahin pi saktaa tha
 In such a situation, Mahadev himself drank poison (hallahal) and was named Neelkanth
 is ghatana se bahut bada sabak miltaa he ki ham bhi jivan main aane vaali negative chizon ko apane andar rakh len lekin uskaa asar na khud par haaavee hone den ar na hi dusron par
 4
 jeevanasathi ke prati sammaan:shiv kaa yah rup jagajaahir he
 According to Hindu beliefs, Mahadev is considered the perfect partner
 agar parvati ne unhen manaane ke liye saalon kii tapasya kii to duusari ore shiv ne unhen ardhangini banaaya
 That is why among the 33 crore deities, Shiva is called Ardhanarishvara
 5
 Keeping the same sentiment at all times: Seeing the complete form of Shiva, it is a message that we cannot see things around us, they have adopted it very easily
 tabhi to unki shaadi par bhuton kii mandali pahunchi thi or sharir main bhabhoot lagaae bholenath ke gale main saanp lipta hota he
 Evil is not in anyone but once you have to adopt it
 6
 Opening of the third eye: Shiva has always been called Trimbak, because he has a third eye
 teesri aankh kaa matlab he ki bodh yaa anubhav kaa ek doosraa aayam khul gaya he
 Two eyes can see only material things
 jo ki bheetar kii ore dekh saktaa he
 With this realization you can see life in a completely different way
 iske baad duniya main jitani chizon kaa anubhav kiya ja saktaa he, unka anubhav ho saktaa he
 Therefore, think before you walk on the things made
 7
 Picking your way: Shiva's lifestyle or an avatar
 ve har rup main bilkul alag hai
 Then that form should be Nataraja orgy, Neelkanth, who drinks poison, Ardhanarishvara, the first to be happy Bholenath
 ve har rup main jivan ko sahi raah dete hai
 For the last 2 days, due to rain in Delhi NCR, the risk of dengue chikungunya may increase further
 kyonki is barish main jagah jagah pani ikaitha ho rahaa he or abhi rajdhani kaa maujuuda taapmaana 30 se 32 ke bich main bana hua hai
 Breeding of mosquitoes is more likely in such temperatures
 ab aise main agar kahin pani jamaa ho gaya to badi aasaani se machhar punap sakate hai
 On the other hand, doctors also believe that the weather will change and the temperature will fall
 jaise hi taapmaana 10 se 15 degree ke aas-paas aayega or lagaataar 5 se 6 dinon tak yahi taapmaana bana rahegaa tabhi in machharon kii breeding rukegi
 It is also important to rain in such a situation
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik monsoon apane aakhri charan par he to ham ye maan sakate hai yahi barish thand kii dastak he
 But this rain is also dangerous in terms of diseases
 ab aisi stithi main sirf satark rahane kii jarurat he
 According to doctors, the threat is not yet over, but is in its final stages
 philhalamchhronse ehtiyaat baratane main hi bhalaai he
 Stay in full sleeve clothes and do not allow water to be collected outside the house
 agencys ko bhi philhal phoging or sapreying jari rakhane kii zaroorat he taaki taapmaana girane tak machharon se ladaai ladi ja sake
 Even if there is no big reason to remember him as a hero, he is a hero in real life

 yadi iesai or pakistani sena aatankwaadi sanghathanon ko samarthan dena band kar den, to mujhe yah kehane main koi hichkichaahat nahin he ki dakshin asia kii suraksha sthiti main ullekhneey sudhaar hoga

 Singh said that in today's digital world, the threat of terrorism has increased greatly and now an incident in one corner of the world can be instant response even thousands of miles away and where one can go online to know that a 'black mind' How to attack without getting out of

 Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Uma Bharti on Friday tied the bridge to praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying, 'he is not an ordinary person but a messiah born in India after a thousand years, which India needed
 ' Taking a sarcasm at former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, he said, `5,000 crore rupees have been spent in the name of Ganga development in the last 29 years, but if Manmohan Singh is asked later, he will say 'main address' but current Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one who says, 'I know everything' because he has answers to every question

 ' pradhanmantri karyaalay main satta ke kendrikaran ke vipaksh ke aarope par bolte hue bharti ne kaha ki purv sarkaar remote dwaara kahin or se sanchalit hoti thi or unhen pradhanmantri karyaalay ke swatantra rup se kaary karne par ajeeb lag rahaa he
 The comments uma bharti ne kaha ki vipaksh unpar bhagavakaran ke saath kaam karne kaa aarope lagaataa he, lekin yah unki samaj se pare he ki aakhir bhagavakaran kya he? saraswati or ganga nadi se judi pariyojnaon main sirf vikaas ko dekha janaa chahie

 He was the first judge of any court to do so
 vahiin, justise karnan ne supreme court ke is faisle ko asanvaidhanik bataaya tha
 He said that from February 8, these seven judges are not allowing me to do any judicial and administrative work
 in logon ne mujhe pareshaan kar diya he or meraa saamaanya jivan kharaab kar diya he
 Therefore, i will take Rs 14 crore as compensation from all seven judges
 supreme court ke nyaayadhish rah chuke markendeya katju ne apni zindagi main kai faisle kiye honge, lekin unke mutabik, aaj vah ek antarjaateey vivaah ko lekar asamanjas main hai
 Markandey Katju has sought advice from a well-educated couple who want to get married, but belong to a different caste, and the girl's parents are strongly against marriage
 supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish ke anusaar, bahut-se yuvak-yuvatiyaan unase shaadi ko lekar salaah maangate rahe hai, jab ve alag-alag jatiyon se hon, or ek-duusare se pyaar karte hon, lekin unke mata-pita (yaa kisi ek ke mata-pita) shaadi ke sakht khilaaf hon
 According to Markandeya Katju, since the young man has expressed confidence in her, she should be given the right advice
 lekin haal hi main unhen fasebuk par ek sandesh mila, jisamen anusuchit jati kaa ek yuvak or anya pichde varg kii ek ladki ek-duusare se mohabbat karte hai, or shaadi karnaa chaahate hai, lekin yuvati ke mata-pita shaadi ke sakht khilaaf hai
 Both also work as doctors in a government hospital in the same city, but according to the parents of the girl, this marriage will hurt their dignity in society
 supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish ke anusaar, "meri soch yah kahati he ki aisi sthiti main vidroh karnaa sahi he, kyonki jati vyavastha hamaare samaaj ke liye shraap he, or yah jitna jaldi khatm ho, utana behatar hoga
 
 
 Inter-caste and inter-religious marriages help eliminate casteism, so it is good for the country
 
 
 lekin duusari ore, vaastaviktaa ko bhi dekha janaa zaruri he
 
 
 In this case, the girl's parents are suffering from high blood pressure and other diseases, and if their daughter marries a Dalit youth, it would be a shock to them, which could lead them to a heart attack and death
 Or they can commit suicide
 
 
 "justise markendeya katju ke mutabik, unki kashmakash yahi he, agar main yuvak-yuvati ko shaadi karne kaa suzav detaa hum, to mere haath khun se rang sakate hai
 
 
 So, what advice should i give them? 
 
 ? apane siddhanton ke viruddh jaaun, yaa apane haathon ko khun se rangane se bachaaun
 
 
 ? " loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad rajasthan congress main ab aarope-pratyarope kaa nayaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 Earlier in the Congress Working Committee, party president Rahul Gandhi had clearly stated that Congress leaders were busy campaigning for their sons only
 lekin ab rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne kaha he ki party ke pradesh adhyaksh sachin payalat ko unke bete vaibhav gahalot kii haar kii jimmedaari leni chahie
 Significantly, the Congress, which formed the government in the month of December, could not win a single seat in the state in the Lok Sabha elections
 abeepi news ko die ek intervyuu main ashok gahalot ne kaha,'sachin payalat ne kaha tha ki ham bade bahumat se jeetenge
 He said that 6 of our mlas have won in Jodhpur Lok Sabha seat
 hamane vahaan acha prachaar kiya he
 
 
 Now Sachin Pilot should at least take responsibility for the defeat in Jodhpur '
 gauratlab he ki ashok gahalot ke bete vaibhav jodhpur seat se 2
 Defeated by 7 lakh votes
 unako bijepi ke gajendra singh shekhavat ne haraaya he
 Ashok Gehlot campaigned here to win his son
 unke virdohi kehete hai ki is seat se baahar nikalakar ashok gahalot kahin or prachaar karne nahin gaye or zyaadaatar reliyaan isi seat par kii hai
 However, changing his statement later, Ashok Gehlot also said that it is everyone's responsibility, whether he is the State Congress President or the Chief Minister
 itani bade paimaane par haar samaj se pare hai
 When Ashok Gehlot was asked in this interview that during the Congress Working Committee meeting, Rahul Gandhi has said that some Congress leaders are busy in keeping the interests of the party ahead of their sons, they said that such meetings would have some secrecy is
 jo kuch bhi andar kaha gaya he use vahiin rahane dena chahie
 His statement has surprised the Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan and State Congress President Sachin Pilot, although he has refused to speak on this
 sachin se jude ek sutara kaa kahana he ki ashok gahalot apane hi poling booth par 400 se voton se haar gaye hai jo ki khud teen baar mukhyamantri, chaar baar vidhayak or paanch baar saansad jodhpur se chune ja chuke hai
 Overall, once again there are reports of estrangement between two big Congress leaders in Rajasthan
 isse pehle bhi mukhyamantri pad ko lekar donon main tanaav ho chukaa he
 Former Union Minister Mani Shankar Aiyarka, who was suspended from the Congress after making controversial remarks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has termed the suspension of PM Modi as an insult to PM Modi and sought a response from Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne manishankar ayyar kaa nilamban radd karne ke liye rahul gandhi kii aalochana kii
 Patra said that this exposes his love and showing of the Congress chief and the person who is involved in many controversies
 bataa den ki gujarat chunaavon se pehle modi ko ‘‘neech kism kaa aadmi’’ kehane ke liye ayyar ko pichley 7 disambar 2017 ko congress ne praathmik sadsyta se nilambit kar diya tha
 Sambit Patra said that what Mani Shankar Aiyar had said about PM Modi was not just a comment, it was only an insult to the Prime Minister of the country but also a racist comment
 unhone kaha pichde varg ko, piem modi ko aap neech kehete hai to puure varg ke liye gaali he
 It is noteworthy that in a statement issued by the Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot on Saturday, it was told that on the recommendation of the party's Central Discipline Committee, Congress President Rahul Gandhi approved the cancellation of Iyer's suspension from the primary membership of the party with immediate effect
 was
 vivaad badhane par ayyar ne di thi safipiem modi ke liye neech shabd istemaal karne par jab vivaad badha, to manishankayyarne safai di thi
 When Iyer was questioned that Rahul Gandhi had hoped that you would apologize for the disputed remarks made on the PM, he said, 'yes i used the word despicable
 main hindi bhashi nahin hum or angreji se translet karata hum
 My Hindi is very weak
 mere dimag main angreji thi or maine Low shabd kaa hindi main anuwaad karke 'neech' kah diya
 If it has any other meaning, i will apologize
 ' unhone kaha, 'piem ko neech kehane kaa meraa koi iraadaa nahin tha
 PM uses dirty language for our leader
 main congress kaa aupchaarik netaa bhi nahin hum
 ' rajd netaa tejasvi prasad yadav ne haal ke dinon main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath unke manch saajha nahin kiye jane par vipakshi mahagathbandhan main ''daraar'' kii atakalon ke bich somvaar ko spasht kiya ki aane vaale dinon main bihar main chunavi reliyon ke dauraan ve congress adhyaksh ke saath manch saajha karenge
 Rahul Gandhi has addressed four election rallies in Bihar so far but Tejashwi did not share the stage with the Congress President
 tejasvi ne mahagathbandhan main shaamil congress, hindustani avam morcha secular or ralospa ke netaaon ke saath patna main somvaar ko patrakaron ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki main nishchit rup se unke (rahul gandhi) saath manch saajha karuunga or aane vaale dinon main aap ise (manch saajha karnaa) dekhenge
 Describing it as part of the strategy, Tejashwi said that we (the leaders of the grand alliance) should cover more and more places during the election campaign
 unhone 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki yahi baat us dauraan bhi kahi ja rahi thi kyonki lalu prasad, rahul gandhi or nitish kumaar manch saajha nahin kar rahe the
 He said that the same strategy was also at that time that the three leaders wanted to cover more and more assembly constituencies during the election campaign
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar, lojpa pramukh ramvilas paswan or bhaajapa ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ke bihar main ekasaath reliyon ko sambodhit kiye jane ke bare tejasvi ne aarope lagaaya ki unka ekasaath hona unki majaburi he kyonki agar ve aisa nahin karenge to unki sabha main ek hajaar log bhi nahin jute paaenge
 Tejashwi alleged that JDU national president Nitish Kumar is always present during the Prime Minister's rally in Bihar because he is well aware that if he does not attend the Prime Minister's rally, the BJP people start doubting him Will give that they have come to me again
 bataa den ki 26 april ko samastipur main hone vaali raily main donon netaa ek hi stage par dikhenge
 Both leaders will seek votes for Mahagathbandhan candidate Ashok Ram

 In court, Pandey's lawyer Rahul Mehra said that Pandey used to send e-mails related to the poster of Ram Jha and Ahmed, but Pandey never replied to the e-mail
 aise main pandey ko giraftaar kiya janaa galat he
 The court rejected the plea of dilip Pandey's counsel

 During a press conference on Saturday, Aam Aadmi Party leader Dilip Pandey alleged that on the basis of the investigation of MCD vigilance, it has come to light that the contractor whose truck has been caught in the South MCD dumping yard, the contractor littered in the North MCD Lifting works
 gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se south emsidi ke jone main aae is trek kii kshamta kul 8 ton kooda uthaane kii thi
 But a 15 tonne litter slip was also recovered from that truck
 bhartiya janata partike netaa dilli kii sadakon se kooda uthavane ke maamle main bhi bhrashtachar karne se baj nahin aa rahe hai
 This waste picker in North MCD is also taking fake payment from South MCD
 'aage dilip pandey ne kaha ki 'is maamle se alag hamane kuch din pehle press conference karke bataaya tha ki kaise north emsidi main kooda uthavane ke naam par bhrashtachar kiya ja rahaa he
 In fact, the Leader of the House in North MCD, Yogendra Chandoulia, wrote a letter to the then North MCD Mayor Ravindra Gupta, that there was a lot of corruption in the name of lifting garbage in his Municipal Corporation, on which Ravindra Gupta did not deny those allegations but Taking the seal of those allegations, the whole shrapnel broke on Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay
 unhonen kaha ki yah sab kuch to satish upaadhyaay ke kehane par hua he
 The Aam Aadmi Party had complained about this corruption in its Maina, run by the bjp-ruled central government, but the ACB has done nothing in this matter till date
 ''aap' ne sawaal poochhate hue aarope lagaaya he ki jis thekedaar ko north emsidi main kooda uthaane ke liye tay keemat (500rupee / metric ton) se dogune daam die ja rahe hai us thekedaar kaa theka takreeban ek-sava saal pehle khatm ho chukaa he
 Without the re-tendering, the garbage is being picked up from that contractor for a three-month extension at double the cost
 aisa kya kaaran he ki ek hi thekedaar par bhartiya janata party ke netaa itane beharbaan hai?philhal aam aadmi party emsidi ke bhrashtachar par vakeelon se puure maamle main kanoonee salaah le rahi he

 On the morning of August 6, when a Punjab Police officer broke the door and entered Anuradha Bali alias Fiza Mohammad's house in Mohali near Chandigarh, his body was found there
 phija kii maut kai din pehle ho chuki thi
 From the same day speculations were started that it is not a normal death but there is a story behind it
 ab ye andeh kuch pukhta hote najar aate hai
 After more than a month of Fiza's death, this case has taken a new turn
 kharad sthit punjab sarkaar kii prayogshaalaon ke teen forensik visheshgyon kii team ne phija kii aant main aluminium phosphid hone kii jaankaree di he-yah kheti main istemaal hone vaala ek khatarnaak jaharila kitnashak he
 These experts were tasked with examining Fiza's intestine to find out the cause of death
 jaisi ummid thi, aant kii report se un atakalon ko phir hawa mil gai he, jo chandigarh sthit maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta or punjab evam haryana hycourt ke varisht vakil ranjan lakhanpal kii is maang se judi he ki is maamle ko ‘hatya maanate hue isaki puri tarah jaanchy kii jaae
 Ranjan told reporters, "fiza's sudden demise is actually" a planned murder committed by high profile people "
 ’’ unki in baton kii sui sidhe taur par phija ke haryana ke purv up-mukhyamantri ke saath puraane or asafal rishte kii ore gumti he
 Fiza, 41, came into the limelight when she married secretly in December 2008 with Chandramohan, the then Deputy Chief Minister of Haryana
 phija ke jivan kaa ant bhi utana hi naatakeey or ekaaki rahaa, jaisi unki nijee jindagi thi
 Chandramohan is the elder son of the late Haryana Bhajan Lal, a former Chief Minister of Haryana and a patron of the Haryana Janhit Congress
 7 agast ko chandigarh main phija ke antim sanskaar main sirf 20 najdiki rishtedaar or dost shaamil hue the
 On the other hand, a new round of speculation had started in the media
 kya yah galati se dawa kaa overdoj tha? kya kisi ne unki hatya kii thi? kya unke akelepan ne unhen khudakushi ke liye majaboor kiya tha? kya yah ek badnaam jivan na ji sakane main unki asamarthta thi?hycourt main yachika daayar karne par vichaar kar rahe lakhanpal ishaara dete hai ki phija akasar apane purv pati ke parivaar se apane jivan ke liye khatre kii ashanka jataati thim
 Chandramohan, who confessed Islam to marry Fiza and gave his name to Chand Mohammed, left her soon after this controversial marriage
 phir ve apni patni or parivaar ke paas laut gaye the
 Barely 20 days after television networks and newspapers broadcast the news of the couple's dramatic escape and marriage, Chandramohan rescued Fiza on the telephone three times saying the word 'divorce'
 chaar bahanon main sabase badi phija kaa janm ke samay naam anuraadhaa bali tha or vah emies (military ejineering services) ke adhikari dharam paul or savitri devi kii beti thi
 Both of them from Ambala had come to Chandigarh just for this reason so that they could provide better education to their children
 punjab uniwarsity ke chandigarh campus ke lau skool main bhartee hone se pehle phija central skool main padhi thim
 She started practicing in the Punjab and Haryana High Court and soon thereafter in 2005 she was appointed Assistant Advocate General in the Punjab Government and then in the Haryana Government
 uske itani teji se aage badaae ke liye pratidwandvi akasar varisht vakeelon or chandramohan samet netaaon ke saath uski ‘sandigdh’ nikatataa ko hi shrey dete the
 The police officers investigating the case are not yet ready to link Fiza's death to some sort of disturbance
 mohali ke varisht police adheekshak (esaspi) gurprit singh bhullar kehete hai, ‘‘zyada sambhaavna is baat kii he ki usne khudakushi kii ho
 "the team of doctors who examine aluminum phosphide in the intestine also believe that since this poison is recognized immediately due to its characteristic odor, it is also possible for someone to mix food or beverages with greater odor
 It is almost impossible to feed poison to Fiza secretly or forcefully
 haalanki bhullar kehete hai ki vah maamle kii file ko band karne ke liye koi khaas jaldi main nahin hai or unhone vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) ko nirdesh die hai ki kisi bhi antim nattejey par pahunchane se pehle har sambhav saboot kaa intjaar kiya jaae
 Bhullar told India Today that his people are now preparing to open Fiza's bank lockers for possible clues
 jaanch team ne guuruuvaar ko phija ke teen bank lowers khulavaa bhi liye, jinamein kul 1
 05 crores Rs
 nakad, sone or heere ke gahane mili hai

 ’’antim dinon main kuch had tak alag-thalag rahane vaali phija padosiyon se dur hi rahati thi, jinke bare main uskaa maananaa tha ki ve gaiyr-paaramparik tareekon ke aadhaar par use jaj karte hai
 Fiza had also broken ties with family members including his two younger sisters Monica and Aditi and his uncle Satpal
 bataaya jaataa he ki jab chachaa ne yah kaha tha ki vah use pareshaan karne vaale padosiyon se nibatane main madad karne ke liye uske sector-48 vaale ghar kii pehali manzil par rahane aa jaae, to phija ne unhen inkaar kar diya tha
 Rajeev Lochan admits that if Fiza had gained wider social support after his relationship with Chandramohan ended, Fiza's life would not have ended as such suddenly
 khaas taur par padosiyon se or us media se, jisane uski shaadi or shaadi ke baad chand dinon ke rishte ko itane ras bhare andaaj main pesh kiya tha
 "for many days, his body being left alone unseen is a milestone for Indian modernity, yet we treat women with aggressive attitude like Fiza in a way that is reminiscent of the primitive era," he says

 Of course, no matter what is said, at the moment the plot will not be solved whether Fiza was killed or he committed suicide

 unhone twit kiya, ‘lalu prasad ko chaara ghotaale ke chaar maamalon main doshasiddhi ke baad chunaav ladane ke liye ayogy tehraaya diya gaya he

 Here, as the matter progressed, another tweet came from Lalu Yadav's Twitter handle, in which he wrote that his social media account is running not from jail but from his office

 "he said" Our party also believes that whatever bill the Central Government brings to eliminate corruption, it should be competent and effective in every matter
 isaliye ise paarit karne se pehle is baat par khaas dhyaan diya janaa chaiye ki vah vidheyak bhrashtachar se nipatane main puri tarah sakasham hona chaiye
 Mayawati said that if Anna Hazare and his team want to pass this bill in the Parliament according to their conditions, then their advice is that these people should agitate to bring the Jan Lokpal Bill
 Instead, contest the Lok Sabha elections to be held in 2014 and then get the bill prepared according to your needs

 He asked the central government to immediately try to break the fast of Anna Hazare, who has been on hunger strike for the last 11 days
 saath hi saath mayawati ne yah bhi kaha ki anna hajaare dwaara kiye ja rahe andolan kii aad main congress (upie) tathaa bhaajapa (endie) ke bich chuuhe billi kaa khel chal rahaa he

 He has been visiting the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) office in Allahabad daily for the last two months
 saket ne pichley varsh pravaktaa rajkeey inter kalege (screening) pariksha-2017 ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 The examination was to be held on February 25 as per the schedule, but it was postponed as soon as the order of CBI investigation of the recruitment of UPPSC was done

 On the morning of 31 January, just at half past ten, the silence of the nine-member squad led by SP Rajiv Ranjan reached the UPPSC office
 pichhali samaajawaadee party (sapa) sarkaar ke dauraan april 2012 se march 2017 ke bich hui bhartiyon ke record kabje main lekar sibiai dal 9 farvari ko waapas dilli laut gaya
 The Commission, which came under the scanner of the CBI inquiry, postponed the proposed Additional Private Secretary (computer Knowledge) Examination-2013 on February 11 and postponed the main examination of Combined state-subordinate Services (PCS) Exam-2017 for two months
 
 saket kehete hai, ''sibiai jaanch ke baad se ayog ne kai parikshaayen sthagit kar di hai, jisase lakhon abhyarthiyon kaa bhavishya adhar main he
 However, the Commission's secretary Jagdish does not consider the CBI inquiry as the reason for postponing the examination
 chunki keval intervyuu ke jariye hone vaali sidhi bhartee kii parikshaon main lage bhrashtachar ke aarope sibiai kii saghan jaanch ke daayre main hai
 In such a situation, many more examinations of the Commission are expected to be postponed

 Contestant student struggle committee official Avinish Pandey, who filed a petition against the rules against recruitments made during the SP rule in the High Court, has collected some data through the Right to Information Act
 avinish bataate hai, ''sapa ke shashan kaal main kul 580 bhartee parikshaayen huin jinamein 40,000 log chaynit hue he
 "obviously, there is a stir among these officers as soon as the CBI inquiry into the recruitment of the Commission begins
" sibiai ne ayog ke daftar ke computer main maujuud pichhali bhartiyon kaa data apni harddisk main jamaa karne ke liye 'forencik recovery of evidence divaais' (fred) kaa istemaal kiya
 It is the most sophisticated way of extracting the data recorded in a computer
 sibiai aisi chaar mashine apane saath lekar ai thi
 "it can also be detected from the Fred machine that there is no tampering of the data recorded in the computer," says a deputy SP posted in the CBI
 ''sibiai team ne jab ayog ke computaron kii forencik jaanch gopneey vibhaag se shuru kii lekin shuruyaat main hi kuch gadabadiyon ke sanket milane par iskaa dayera anya vibhaagon tak fail gaya
 During the scanning of the computer, the CBI team also made extensive inquiries with the employees of the concerned department, in which information was found about the irregularities in the recruitment processes

 It consists of a coaching coach of the city and a personal physician

 In these, mainly those decisions have come under scrutiny, the former Chairman of the Commission, Dr
 anil yadav ne pariksha prakriya ko durust karne ke naam liye the
 The CBI officials reached Mumfordganj directly after starting the investigation from the employee to the officer's office in the Commission's office in Allahabad
 yahaan fawwara chauraahaa ke paas chaay kii dukaan par baithkar adhikariyon ne pratiyogiyon se ayog kii bhartiyon main gadbaditon ke sakshya muhaiyaa karaane ko kaha
 After this, the process of reaching the candidates started in the CBI camp office at Circuit House, Govindpur
 pratiyogiyon ne sibiai ko sakshya ke saath ek shikaayat patr saunpa he jisamen zikr he ki ayog main anil yadav ke adhyaksh rahane ke dauraan intervyuu main sadasyon se pencil se number dene ko kaha gaya tha
 The students told the CBI the name of the employee who later erased the numbers written with pencil
 unhone iske alaava ek anya karmchaaree kaa naam bhi bataaya he jo computer main darj numberon ke saath chhedchhad karata tha
 The students have also given details of the assets of these employees along with many other people associated with the commission, which does not match their income at all
 ayog ke do purv sachiv anil kumaar yadav or rijawanurrahman bhi sibiai ke nishane par hai
 Ayodhya Singh, former chairman of the Competitive Student Conflict Committee, says, "the post of Secretary of the Commission is of IAS level but the SP government has deployed a lot of junior officers on it
 iske virodh ke baavjood jab sarkaar ne koi karrwai nahin kii to court ke aadesh par rijawanurrahman ko hatana padaa tha
 "CBI has also got information about the mess in the assessment by making arbitrary appointment of examiners in the commission
" pratiyogiyon se mili soochnaaon ko bhi centre main rakhkar ab sibiai ayog se mili data kaa vishleshan karegi
 This process can take up to a month
 iske baad sibiai ayog ke purv adhyakshon or sachivon se poochtacha shuru karegi
 In this way, tightening the scrutiny of the investigation, the reservation process in the UPSC recruitment examinations is under scrutiny

 How does the scaling applied in UPPSC examinations increase the marks of two candidates who score the same marks in the same subject? Why is there more difference between reduced and increased digits? There is a possibility of disturbances in this also

 The biggest challenge before the CBI is to merge all the links in the recruitment processes of the Commission

 Asked about the opposition's accusation of him being the 'dummy chief minister', Manjhi strongly denied that he was accused of such a common background and coming from the Scheduled Caste (SC) community

 Hajj is said to be one of the five basic principles of Islam and it is considered a Sunnah for one to perform Hajj when one fulfills his family duties
 abhi tak muslim mahilaon ke liye haj par janaa bahut mushkil tha, kyonki unhen har samay apane parivaar (meharam) ke ek purush ke saath rahanaa padataa tha, lekin is saal bharat or saudi arab ke bich aapasi charchaa ke baad ab bhartiya muslim mahilaayein bina purush ke saath bhi haj par ja sakengi
 After this right given to Muslim women, 100 women have applied to go on Haj this year alone in Uttar Pradesh and the maximum number is from Agra mandal
 sutron kaa daawa he ki pichley saal kii tulana main is saal haj ke liye aavedan karne vaali mahilaon kii sankhya paanch guna tak bad sakati he
 SU Qureshi, a former member of the UP Hajj Committee, said that the rules changed for Hajj last year allowed women over the age of 45 and who did not have legal Mehram to go to Saudi Arabia in small groups for Hajj
 
 rashtriya haj samiti ne us saal 20 mahilaon ko 4 - 4 mahilaon ke samoohon main haj par bheja tha
 Sami Aghai, president of the Muslim Development Council of India, said that the Modi government is trying to be friendly to Muslim women
 haj main bina meharam jane ke nirnay kaa shrey modi sarkaar lene kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 He said that according to Sharia law, Hajj cannot be said to be complete for a woman unless she is with Mehram
 sambhavat: isiilie sarkaar mahilaon ko chaar ke samooh main bhej rahi he
 Although many women have applied to travel with Mehram this year, the number of women traveling without Mehram is also high
 aisi mahilaayein modi sarkaar ke is kadam kii prashansa kar rahi hai
 Mufti Mudassar Ali Khan Qadri said that although Hajj is a duty that can be fulfilled even if the woman performs Hajj without Mehram, the Modi government should avoid interfering too much in Islamic law
 yadi sarkaar pragatisheel dikhnaa chaahati he or musalamaanon kaa kuch kalyaan karnaa chaahati he, to use muslim ulimaon ke ek samooh ke saath har muslim kendrit kanoonon par charchaa kerani chahie
