 Till evening, there were reports that the pdp-national Conference (NC) -congress coalition government could be formed
 raat 8 baje achaanak khabar ai ki rajyapal satyapal malik ne vidhansabha bhang kar di or sarkaar banane kii sari kavayadon par viraam lag gaya
 Before dissolution, these three parties witnessed considerable jugalbandi
 pidipi netaa altaaf bukhari umr abdulla se mili
 On the other hand, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad also appeared hopeful by Wednesday evening that a coalition government would be formed to 'protect Kashmir'
 haalanki, teenon partiyon kaa mail-milaap bahut der tak nahin chalaa or vidhansabha bhang hote hi teenon ne yah jataane kii koshish kii ki gathbandhan kii baat gambhir nahin thi, balki kayaason kaa daur tha
 Ghulam Nabi Azad came to the forefront and told the media that a formal decision had not been taken yet
 baat mahaj meeting karne ko lekar thi or isi aadhaar par rajyapal ne vidhansabha bhang kar di
 Azad's meaning of 'cleanliness' Azad clarified that there was talk about alliance but there was no serious discussion
 aaazaad ne yah bhi kaha ki abhi to koi baithak bhi nahin hui thi, lekin rajyapal ne dar se vidhansabha bhang kar di
 What does this mean for Azad? It is understandable that the Congress was earlier talking of an alliance with PDP-NC, but when the Assembly was dissolved, it tried to get rid of both parties, because it is well aware that PDP and NC openly open panchayat elections Have boycotted aise main congress aakhir yah badanaami kyon apane sir mol le ki usne un partiyon se galabahiyaan kin, jo sarkaar bananaa to chaahate hai magar jammu kashmir kii awam ko panchayat adhikaar nahin dena chaahate
 The signs of the alliance are clear
 Congress is a national party while NC-PDP is regional
 isliye congress kii praathamikta in donon partiyon se jarur alag hogi, lekin gathbandhan kaa takaza jo na karaae
 The pressure is also on the fact that the Congress does not want to allow the BJP to re-enter Jammu and Kashmir in any case
 iske liye use ‘avasarwaadi’ gathbandhan bhi pasand he
 The Congress is doing this because it wants to keep its glory in the valley
 alakh un kaaryon or agenda ke virodh kaa he jise bijepi ne aage badhaayaa he
 The question is, will the politics beyond this be satisfied? In politics, the thinking of the very front is not given due consideration
 soch hoti he jald sarkaar banane kii or satta par arudh hone kii
 Congress is also following the same rut
 chandrababu naidu ke utprerak bal ne use or balashaali banaaya he kyonki isse bhavi aam chunaavon main tisare morche kii sambhaavna dikhne lagi he
 If it joins the PDP and NC, then the Congress is seeing the benefit
 congress kaa 2019 par dhyanhal kii siyaasi hulchalon se saaf he ki bhavi aam chunaav main choti partiyon or kshatrapon kaa bada role hoga
 The smaller parties will play the kingmaker
 congress ko pataa he ki teesraa morcha itani jaldi banane nahin ja rahaa kyonki iskaa ulat asar ho saktaa he or logon kaa mood modi sarkaar ke paksh main ja saktaa he
 So unless there is an openness to openly prepare for the Third Front, what is the harm in bringing small parties together? The Congress is currently following the same policy
 buudhvaar tak jammu kashmir main pidipi-ensi-congress kii jo taiyaari thi, uskaa labboluab yahi tha ki agle paanch maheene tak sarkaar ek saath chalati rahe, taaki iskaa phayda loksabhaa chunaavon main mili or bijepi ke khilaaf maahaul banaaya ja sakegaa
 However, this could not happen and the plan of the three parties was shelved
 congress-ensi kii sangatcongress or ensi main shuru se banati rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi and Omar Abdullah are also of one age
 saal 2009 main rahul gandhi ne umr kaa samarthan kar unhen desh kaa sabase kam umr kaa mukhyamantri banwaaya

 saal 2012 main dilli main upie kii sarkaar thi or jammu kashmir main ensi kii
 At that time, Rahul Gandhi, while connecting the Abdullah family and his family, reminded Jawaharlal Nehru's day and explained how these two families have contributed to the country and Kashmir

 The people around informed the incident to Deepak's family members

 As soon as Deepak's death was reported, his family started a furore in the hospital

 Police registered a case of murder on the complaint of the family and apprehended the accused minor

 Gujarat government's transport minister makes helmets mandatory on allstate and national highway manoj yadav beeti 14 janvari ko bihar main navada jile ke sadar police thane main hiraasat main tha
 The father of this 28-year-old youth, Dayanand Yadav, was crying when he visited her
 police ne manoj ko itani yatnaa di ki vah dard se bilabila rahaa tha
 Even his father could not eat the homemade food he had brought for him
 agle din, manoj kii laash sunsaan maidan main padi mili
 His mouth was open and a lot of saliva came out of him
 manoj kaa koi aapraadhik record nahin tha, lekin police ne use duusari baar giraftaar kiya tha
 In November 2011, he was caught using a mobile phone of a businessman who had been murdered
 haalanki manoj ko vah mobile sadak par laavaaris padaa mila tha
 The police released him after being found innocent after questioning, but on increasing pressure to solve the murder case, Manoj was again arrested by the police on 11 January
 is baar police ne kuch kabuulwane ke liye use buree tarah maaraa-peeta, jisase antat uski maut ho gai
 Her 25-year-old widow and mother of three children, Reena Devi, says, "my husband was so immature that he used to use someone else's mobile and he lost his life for this mistake
 ab ham log apni jindagi kaise kaatenge?’ is ghatana par hangaamaa much gaya or police ko majabuuran paanch pulisavaalon ke khilaaf exiar darj kerani padi
 Nawada Superintendent of Police Surendra Lal Das claims that Manoj was never arrested, but could not give any answer as to why an FIR was lodged against the policemen in this case
 rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog (enechaarsi) ne deshbhar main april, 2010 se 31 march, 2011 ke bich hiraasat main hui maut ke 1,574 maamle darj kiye yani rojaanaa chaar maut 'een
 This number includes police custody as well as judicial custody
 331 maut ke saath uttar pradesh pratham sthaan par he, duusare sthaan par bihar (136 maut) or uske thik baad maharashtra (130 maut) he
 In this way, 37 percent of the deaths in custody across the country are in these three states
 adaalat main pesh kiye jane ke pehle kisi sandigdh ko hawalat main rakhaa jaataa he, or use un logon kii tarah kanoonee sangrakshan praapt nahin hota he, jaisaa nyaayik hiraasat main band logon ko yaa jail main band logon ko praapt hota he
 The law says that no person can be detained for more than 24 hours
 lekin police record main giraftaar dikhaae jane ke pehle kaa samay isamen shaamil nahin hota he
 The time of police custody starts when the court allows it, not when the accused is arrested and that is why Nawada's police are refusing to arrest Manoj
 bihar maanavadhikaar ayog ke adhyaksh justise (ritred) es
 N
 jha kehete hai, ‘police kaa gathan maanavadhikaron kii raksha ke liye kiya gaya tha
 But when the police itself violates it, then from where will the public get protection? Many times they do not appear in court within 24 hours of arresting the accused
 hawalat janata kii nigaah se pare hoti he or koi nahin jaanata ki vahaan kya hota he
 According to the National Human Rights Commission, 1,321 cases of custodial deaths were reported in the Ministry of Home Affairs between April 2010 and December 2010
 report ke anusaar enechaarsi kii jaanch shakha police hiraasat main hui 88 maut kii jaanch kar chuki he
 The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data under the Ministry of Home Affairs is considered the most authentic record of crimes in the country
 enciarabi ke mutabik, police hiraasat main sirf 72 maut ke maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 Explaining this discrepancy, a senior IPS officer states that the police inform all the cases of death in custody to the NHRC, which is why the number in the Home Ministry report is high
 inamen se kuch hi maamalon ko enciarabi ko bheja jaataa he
 The NCRB report appears to be a deliberate attempt to hide police torture
 ek namoona dekhieh hiraasat main maut ke kaarnon ke bare main enciarabi kii talika main hawalat main di gai yatnaa kaa koi zikr hi nahin he
 Instead, such entries have been made, such as death during hospitalization, assault by other criminals, death during mob attack / riot, suicide or death while trying to escape

 In September 2011, at the Veeramgam police station in Gujarat, 37-year-old Dasharathaji Thakor committed suicide with his shoe laces within three hours of being arrested in a kidnapping case
 13 janvari ko ek sandigdh naksali pudiami maadaa ne chhattisgarh ke dantewada ke sukama police thane main 'aatmahatya' kar lee
 However, medical reports have confirmed scratches in his genitals
 police ko rokane vaala koi nahin he
 Relatives of victims or human rights groups have complained of alleged murder in lock-up, but only a minor defect has been proved in them

 The four policemen were convicted in 1995 for kidnapping and killing human rights activist Jaswant Singh Khalda

 During a special conversation with NDTV, he said that the government believes in doing both plan and work together
 unhone kaha ki single yuj plastic se chhutkaare ke baad na sirf bharat ko phayda milegaa, balki puri duniya ko iskaa laabh ho
 Single use plastic will be rid of in a phased manner
 ram vilaas paswan ne saaf kiya ki kisi bhi str par logon ke swasth ke saath samjhauta bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 The Modi government has made up its mind that if plastic is to be banned, it will remain
 plastic ke vikalp or ise bain karne se naukariyon par khatre or anya pareshaaniyon par ram vilaas paswan ne kaha ki agar ek vikalp band hota he to doosraa khulegaa
 If there is a ban on single-use plastic, then its alternative will be ready, it will also generate employment
 plastic ke vikalpon ko lekar baatcheet ho rahi he
 When asked about Ram Vilas Paswan, why the plastic production is not stopped, he said that it is natural that as long as there is a market, people will keep buying
 hamen donon str par kaam karnaa hoga
 Also, attention has to be paid to re-cycling

 Other distinguished citizens of the country, youth, literature and social workers and others have done a commendable job of raising the forehead of India around the world
 anginat un logon ko bharat kii pracheer se hriday se shubhakamanaayen detaa hum
 The vastness of India in front of the world, the diversity of India is glorified
 jaise bharat kii anek vividhtaayen hai, bharat kii vishalata he, vaise hi bharat ke jan-jan main saralata bhi he or bharat ke kone-kone main ekta bhi he
 This is the power of our country
 har yug main use nayaa nikhaar dene kaa prayaas hua he
 This country has arrived here amidst ancient traditions
 hamaari ekta, saralata, bhaichara, sadbhaav bahut badi puunji he
 It should never be stained
 agar desh kii ekta bikhar jaae to sapane bhi chur-chur ho jate he, isiilie jatvaad ke jehar, sampradaay ke junun ko kisi bhi rup main jagah nahin deni he
 This country is moving forward because of Team India
 yah team india sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii vrihad team he
 Has the world thought that when a team of 125 crore countrymen unite, they increase and save the nation
 ham jahaan pahunchane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, wo sava sau karod kii team ke kaaran he
 Public participation is the biggest capital in a democracy
 team india kaa ek hi janadesh he or vah yah ki hamaari sari vyavasthaaen, sari yojanaayen is desh ke garib ke kaam aani chahie
 We want to strengthen the fight for freedom from poverty
 garib bhi garibi se jang karnaa chahta he
 i had some thoughts before you on August 15, when i was new
 maine jo shuru-shuru main dekha tha usko koi laag-lapet ke bina khule man se deshavaasiyon ke saamne rakh diya tha, lekin aaj ek saal ke baad usee laal kile kii pracheer se deshavaasiyon ko vishwaas dilaataa hum ki ek saal main team india ek nae vishwaas ke saath, nae samarthy ke samaysima main sapanom ko saakaar karne main jute gai he
 It takes a lot of hard work to bring 17 crore countrymen to the bank
 bank ke karmchaariyon, bainkon kaa hriday se abhinandan karata hum, kyonki unhone bank ko garibon ke saamne laakar rakh diya
 If you look at the pyramid of development in a country like India, then its bottom surface is the strongest
 aaj vikaas ke pyramid ke aadhaar main desh kaa dalit, peedit, upekshit baitha he
 So we have to strengthen the pyramid of development
 hamane saamaajik suraksha, garibon kii bhalaai par bal diya he
 Respect and pride of workers should be our national duty, nature
 ab kaam chhodane par bhi asangathit mazdooron kaa paisa unke paas aayega
 The game of making new laws continued in our country
 zyada kanoon sushasan ke liye thik nahin
 We included 44 laws for the poor
 aaj main hisaab dena chahta hum
 i want to tell the 125 crore countrymen that this country can be free from corruption
 bhrashtachar hamaare desh main dimak kii tarah laga hua he
 It will take time to finish this termite
 15 hajaar karod kii gas sabsidi ko saadhe khatm karne kaa nirnay le saktaa tha
 We passed this gas subsidy directly to the customers' account
 aaj team india se kahana chahta hum ki is sabsidi ke naam par salanaa 15 hajaar karod rupaya chori hota tha, vah band ho gaya
 In this way, there was corruption in the name of gas subsidy from the country
 kuch logon ko niraashaa kii gart main doobane kaa shauk hota he
 Some people keep on finding and spreading despair
 agar koyale kii charchaa karuunga to kuch raajnneetik pandit use raajnneeti kii taraazoo se tolange
 Pray to them, do not weigh the coal you are going to discuss with Ranjeeti's scales
 hamane nirnay liya koyala, spectrum or khanij kii nilaamee kii jaaegi, ab samay seemaa main nilaamee se teen lakh karod rupee desh ke khajaane main aaenge
 Treasures of those who looted the wealth of Hindustan closed
 koyala nilaamee se dallalon ko jhatka laga
 i was pressurized not to do FM radio auctions, but under transparency we got FM radio auctions done in many cities
 manaregaa kaa paisa or bacchon kii chaatravruti kaise sidhe unke acount main jaae is disha main hamane kaam kiya
 We have succeeded in reducing inflation
 use or neeche laane kaa prayaas jari he
 Before we arrived inflation was in double digits
 garib kii thali main santoshjanak khaanaa mili, ham is disha main aage chal rahe hai
 There is a great need for change in the agricultural life of the country
 hamen jameen kii upjau takat badhaani padegi
 It has been decided to invest 50 thousand crore rupees for agricultural irrigation scheme
 hamen apane krishi jivan main andolan shuru karnaa he
 Four urea fertilizer factories in eastern India are closed
 nai uria niti banane se unhen dobaaraa jivit karne kii disha main kaam kar rahe hai
 The welfare of the farmers is as important as the welfare of the army personnel in the country
 kisaan kalyaan kaa behad mahatv he
 Now the Ministry of Agriculture will be known as the Ministry of Farmers Welfare
 aazaadee ke itane varshon baad bhi desh main kareeb 18,500 gaanv bina bijli ke hai
 These villages are deprived of the light of freedom
 agar puraane tareekon se chalate rahe to 10 saal main bhi in gaanvon main bijli nahin pahunchengi
 With the help of states' cooperation and local bodies, in the coming 1000 days, 18,500 villages will be electrified
 koyala adivaasiyon ke bich main he, aise main un par dhyaan diya jaae
 This year, Dr
 ambedkar kii 125veen jayanti kaa varsh he
 Every bank branch resolves that in its area where there is a tribal settlement, where it is not there, every bank branch should give loan to a dalit-adivasi for start-up
 isse hamaare desh main sava lakh dalit udhyami paidaa honge
 Banks should also help women entrepreneurs
 isse desh main nae udhyami paidaa honge or desh ke aarthik jivan main badlaav aayega
 The country's military is the property of the nation

 This morning is the resolve of the resolve of 125 crore countrymen and on such a holy festival, due to the sacrifices, sacrifices and penance, the men who fought for the pride of India for centuries, spent youth in jail, but did not give up their dreams Chhote, i offer such freedom to the freedom fighters
 desh ke anya ganmaanya nagarikon, yuva, sahityakaron or samajaseviyon evam anya ne vishwa bhar main bharat kaa maathaa ooncha karne kaa abhinandaneey kaary kiya
 i heartily wish those countless people from the ramparts of India
 vishwa ke saamne bharat kii vishalata, bharat kii vividhta ke gungan hote rahete hai
 Just as there are many variations of India, there is greatness of India, similarly there is simplicity in the people of India and there is unity in every corner of India
 yahi hamaare desh kii shakti he
 There has been an attempt to refine him in every era
 puraatan paramparaon ke bich yah desh yahaan pahunchaa he
 Our unity, simplicity, brotherhood, harmony are huge capital
 is par kabhi daag nahin laganaa chahie
 If the unity of the country falls apart, the dreams also crumble, that is why the poison of casteism, the passion of the sect is not to be given in any way
 yah desh team india ke kaaran aage bad rahaa he
 This team India is a large team of 125 crore countrymen
 kya duniya ne sochaa he ki sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team jab ek hokar lag jaati he, wo raashtra ko badhaati hai or bachaati bhi he
 Where we are trying to reach is due to a team of 125 crore
 loktantr main janabhagidaari sabase badi puunji hoti he
 Team India has only one mandate and that all our arrangements, all the schemes should serve the poor of this country
 ham garibi se mukti kii ladaai ko bal pradaan karnaa chaahate hai
 The poor also want to fight poverty
 15 agast ko aapke saamne kuch vichaar rakhe the, tab main nayaa tha
 What i saw in the beginning was that i had put it in front of the countrymen with no open mind, but today after a year, from the ramparts of the same Red Fort, i assure the countrymen that in a year Team India will get a new With confidence, the new potential deadline has begun to make dreams come true
 17 karod deshavaasiyon ko bank tak laane ke liye bahut ji-jaan se jutana padataa he
 The bank employees heartily congratulate the banks, because they brought the bank to the poor
 bharat jaise desh main agar vikaas kaa pyramid dekhen, to uske sabase neeche kii sataha sabase majboot hoti he
 Today, at the base of the pyramid of development, the country's Dalit, victim, is sitting neglected
 isliye hamen vikaas ke pyramid ko majboot karnaa he
 We have emphasized social security, the well being of the poor
 shramikon kaa sammaan or gaurav hamaara rashtriya kartavya, swabhaav hona chahie
 Now even after leaving work, the money of unorganized laborers will come to them
 nayaa kanoon banane kaa khel hamaare desh main chalata rahaa
 More law is not good for good governance
 garibon ke liye 44 kanoonon ko hamane samet diya
 Today i want to calculate
 main sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ko kahana chahta hum ki yah desh bhrashtachar se mukt ho saktaa he
 Corruption is like a termite in our country
 is dimak ko khatm karne main samay lagegaa
 Could have decided to end the gas subsidy of 15 thousand crores
 hamane yah gas sabsidi graahakon ke khate main sidhi pahunchaai
 Today i want to tell Team India that in the name of this subsidy, 15 thousand crore rupees was stolen annually, it stopped
 is tarah desh se gas sabsidi ke naam par chal rahaa bhrashtachar chalaa gaya
 Some people are fond of drowning in the trough of despair
 kuch log niraashaa dhundte rahete or failaate rahete hai
 If i discuss coal, some political pundits will weigh it with the scales of politics
 unase prarthana karata hum jis koyale kii charchaa karne ja rahaa he use ranjiti ke taraazoo se na tolein
 We decided that coal, spectrum and minerals will be auctioned, now three lakh crores rupees will come to the nation's coffers from the auction within the time limit
 hindustan kii sampatti luutane waalon ke khajaane band hue
 Brokers were shocked by the coal auction
 efem radio ke ocshan na karne kaa mujh par kaaphi dabaav daalaa gaya, lekin hamane paardarshita ke tahat kai shaharon main efem radio ke ocshan karwaae
 We worked in the direction of how the money of the MNREGA and the scholarship of the children goes directly to their account
 mahangaai kam karne main ham safal hue hai
 Efforts are on to bring him down further
 hamaare aane se pehle mahangaai do ankon main thi
 We found satisfactory food in the poor's plate, we are moving forward in this direction

 We have to increase the fertile power of the land
 50 hajaar karod rupee krishi sinchai yojana ke liye lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 We have to start a movement in our agricultural life
 purvi bharat main chaar uria fertilizer ke kaarkaane band pade hai
 By making a new urea policy, they are working towards reviving them
 desh main sena ke javaanon ke kalyaan ke jitna mahatv hi kisaan ke kalyaan kaa he
 Farmer welfare is very important
 ab krishi mantralay kisaan kalyaan mantralay ke rup main janaa jayega
 Even after so many years of independence, about 18,500 villages in the country are without electricity
 aazaadee ke prakaash se ye gaanv vanchit hai
 If we continue with the old methods, then even in 10 years, electricity will not reach these villages
 rajyon ke sahyog or sthaneey nikaayon kii madad se aane vaale ek hajaar din main 18,500 gaanv main bijli pahunchane kaa kaam karenge
 Coal is among the tribals, so they should be taken care of

 It is the year of 125th birth anniversary of Ambedkar
 har bank branch yah sankalp kare ki apane ilaake main jahaan tribal basti ho, jahaan nahin he, vahaan daliton ko, har bank branch ek dalit-adivasee ko start ap ke liye lone de
 This will generate 1
25 lakh Dalit entrepreneurs in our country
 mahila udhyamiyon ke liye bhi bank madad karen
 This will create new entrepreneurs and change the economic life of the country
 desh kaa faujee raashtra kii sampatti he
 The 'one Rank One Pension' proposal came before every government
 abhi tak main ise nahin kar paaya, lekin main vishwaas dilaataa hum, siddhantat: 'van rank-van pension' hamane sweekaar kiya hua he or iske sanghathanon se baat chal rahi he
 Keeping in mind that everyone should get justice, we have found a way

 The comments 15 agast 2022 ke liye sankalp lenaa he ki ham desh or samaaj kii bhalaai ke liye aage badhenge
 Every department and unit of the government should also get involved in the work
 swabhimani, samrudh, susanskrit, shreshth bharat bananaa he

 ’’ After Alpesh and Jignesh in Gujarat, the Congress, which is trying to lash Hardik Patel, is now in political battle with a new strategy
 sutron ke mutabik congress alaakaman ne purv cabinet mantri or varisht vakil kapil sibbal jo samvidhan ke gyaata bhi hai, unako is kaam par lagaaya ki patel andolan ke chalate hardik patel kii aarakshan kii maang maan lee jaae
 So that Hardik Patel also joined the Congress
 isi fehrist mengujarat congresske sabase bade patidaar netaa siddharth patel or gujarat congress ke legal cell ke head ajay bankuria ne dilli aakar kapil sibbal se mulaakaat kii
 According to Sibal's 3 option letters to Sonia, Kapil Sibal has suggested 3 options to Sonia on Hardik's demand for reservation in view of the constitution
 jiske baad un vikalpon par aaj-kal main sonia hari jhandi de dengi
 After that the Congress will reveal its formula to Hardik Patel
 bijepi ke virodh main congress kaa sathsutron kii maane to hardik patel or congress ke bich ajay bankuria vah shaks hai, jo patidaar samaaj se aate hai
 He is associated with the Congress but has also been a lawyer for Hardik
 unki maujuudagi main congress aurasibbalwah formula taiyaar kar rahe hai
 So that Hardik Patel can support Congress in the name of BJP opposition
 congress or sibbal kii koshish he ki is puure maamle kii jaankaree media ke jariye baahar aane se pehle hardik patel tak pahunche or vah formule par sahmati jataaen
 Only after which the case proceeded
 congress ko lagata he ki agar maamla pehle baahar aa gaya to baat bighad sakati he
 Therefore, Congress is sitting behind Sibal's formula
 vah chaahati he ki sidhe deal ho, bich main formula baahar aayaa to maamla bighad saktaa he
 It can be found in such a way that Sibal will tell the extent to which the state government can implement the reservation formulas regarding constitutional
 lekin bich main funsane par koshish yahi rahegi ki puure maamle ko centre par daal diya jaae
 That is, the state government should not accept the entire demand of Hardik Patel on its own and later, Hardik and Congress would say together that if the state and the Center wanted this reservation would have been available to the Patidars

 Therefore, the Patidars were deprived of reservation
 aakhir main congress isi formule par aage badhkar rajya main hardik kaa samarthan le sakati he
 In such a situation, Hardik and Congress together can target the BJP

 But it is his effort that Hardik, Jignesh and Alpesh do not appear among their voters in front of the Congress
 balki congress se unke hiton kii baat karte dikhaai den
 So that his voters can stay with him and help Congress

 But the people and activists of other parties are repeatedly remembering Arvind Kejriwal
 raajnneetik kaaryakarta tanj kar rahe hai to janata un par dhokheybaaj hone kaa aarope madh rahi he
 The village here says Seema of Lohta, "last year, i had taken the water of the Ganges in hand and said that whatever happens, Benares will not leave
 maheenon yaheen banaras main pade rahe the
 They also got votes
 par, haarane ke baad dobaaraa darshan nahin die
 This time did not even come to contest elections
 ''seemaa ke saath khadey rakesh kehete hai, ''ranchhod'' naam die hai
 Meaning that Ran leaves and runs away
 abaki ladane nahin aae, modi se dar gaye kya? rakesh kii yah baat darasal khiz kaa nateeja he, ''pichhali baar narendra modi ko arvind kejariwal ne takkar di thi, jahaan congress ke ajay raay kii jamaanat jabt ho gai thi vahiin kejariwal ko yahaan ke 2 lakh nau hajaar logon ne vot diya tha

 Winning defeat is part of politics
 lekin apane voter se aisa dagaa, ab yahaan ke voter kabhi un par bharosa nahin karenge

 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke rashtriya sachiv aar
 P
 singh ne us vakt kaha tha, ''inkaa koi thor-thikaana nahin, kabhi kasam khaakar kehete hai, congress or bhaajapa se samarthan nahin lenge, phir congress se samarthan ke liye bilkul desparat ho jate hai
 It is said that i will never leave Benares and then flee to Delhi, never go to Benaras
 sach to yah he ki kejariwal sahab satta prapti ke liye aam aadmi kaa mukhauta pahanakar aam aadmi ko hi chhalte hai
 Congress spokesperson Harnam Singh also agreed with the BJP spokesperson
 philhal is baar banaras main narendra modi ko takkar dene vaala koi pratyaashee najar nahin aa rahaa

 https: / / t
 co / n9djhx3j0c Jayshree Bajoria India became the ninth country in the world to have a database of sex offenders in order to respond to the fear of 'stranger danger'
 isamen balaatkaar or yon hamale ke doshiyon ke nijee byore hai
 The year-old database has 5 lakh names in it and the government says the police will use it for 'regular monitoring and tracking'
 yon badsuluki rokane or aparaadhiyon ko sajaa dilaane ke liye sarkaar ke harek str par majboot koshishen behad ahm hai or is database ko sahi tehraane ke liye afasaron ne baar-baar aise aparaadh karne vaale shaks kaa hawala diya
 But the latest crime figures show that out of 38,947 rape cases in 2016, around 95% of the accused were acquainted with the victim
 jab tak kanoon lagu karne ke behatar intjaam or raksha ke paryaapt upaay nahin honge, yah database badlaav laane main zyada kargar nahin hoga
 The government's pressure to effectively deal with indiscriminate sexual violence is on the government
 magar loklubhaavan or technology se jude fori samaadhaanon ke bajaae sarkaar ko chahie ki vah gahari jaden jamaaye baithi dhanchaagat baadhaon ko todgaye ke liye kadi mehnat kare, jo in aparaadhon ke bare main bataane or insaaf hasil karne main peeditaaon ke raste main aati hai
 In my 2017 report 'everybody Blames Me: Barriers to Justice and Support Service for Sexual Assault Survivors in India' for Human Rights Watch, i found that there are still unbearable obstacles when police report a report of sexual assault to particularly disadvantaged sections of victims
 Have to face
 police thanon or aspataalon main unhen aksar apmaan jhelana padataa he, 'tu finger test' jaisi tauheen karne vaali chikitsa jaanch se guzarana padataa he or aaropee ke pratishodh se bachane ke liye koi suraksha nahin milti
 They also face difficulties in obtaining health care, consultation and legal assistance
 sarkaar ne bal yon durvyavhaar rokane ke liye ab tak prabhavi tantra kaayam nahin kiya he
 Divyang women and girls face even more challenges
 human ritis watch or american civil liberties union ke adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki america main yon aparaadhiyon kii saarvajanik panjikarnon ne madad ke bajaae nuksaan zyada pahunchaaya he
 As a result, such ex-offenders are subjected to harassment, boycott and violence and there are problems in their rehabilitation
 bharat ke database main aise harek shaks kaa naam, pataa, tasviir, ungaliyon kii chhap or biometric data sahit aadhaar card ke byore shaamil hai
 The government says that the database will currently be accessible only to law enforcement officers
 haalanki afasar tasdik karte hai ki bhavishya main database main un logon ko bhi shaamil kiya jayega jo aaropee the par doshi nahin paae gaye
 The possibility of making the database public has also not been ruled out
 database banane kii khatir sarkaar ne jo nivida mangai usamen kaha gaya tha ki isamen bacchon sahit ve sab shaamil honge, jinhen yon aparaadhon ke liye giraftaar, aropit yaa doshi tehraaya gaya he
 The information of the culprits will be public while the rest of the information will be accessible only to law enforcement agencies
 isamen aise logon ko 'nimna', 'madhyam' or 'ucch jokhim' vaale shakhson main baantne kaa prastaavit tha
 Whether or not a person is included in it is dependent on the laws of the past, full of the possibility of misuse
 sarkaar ne aparaadhiyon kii pahchaan or jahiraa taur par police vyavastha main sudhaar laane ke liye haal hi main chehre ko pahchaanane vaali swachaalit pranali hasil karne kii ore kadam badhaayaa he, jisase niztaa, jasusi or swatantraaa ko lekar chintaaen bad gai hai
 Reports of rapes are less frequently reported in India
 aisa saamaajik kalank, peedit ko doshi tehraane, aapraadhik nyaayik pranali kii kharaab pratikriya or peedit va gavaahon kii hifaazat ke rashtriya kanoon ke na hone kii vajah se hota he
 There is a great fear that there will be heavy pressure from the accused and the police not to write a report on the victim
 bacchon ke maamle main parivaar or samaaj kaa dabaav padane kii ashanka or zyada hoti he
 The government says that there will be no breach of privacy from this database
 magar bharat main niztaa or data kii suraksha ke kanoonon ke na hone se chintaaen bad jaati hai
 When violence by self-styled defenders is on the rise, the rumor of breach and inclusion of names in the data is particularly alarming
 database kii jaankaree ke prasar ke bare main bahut kam pataa he or yah bhi ki isse pakshpaat jari rah saktaa he yaa nahin
 Will this information be available to the prospective employee's background investigative employer? The government should work closely with women and child rights groups to deal with sexual offenses, so that the criminal justice system, focusing on evidence-based solutions To improve and promote victim-centered attitudes
 yon aparaadhiyon kaa register iskaa jawaab nahin he

 Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi, citing the 'current environment', has urged the government to immediately release funds for the timely purchase of paper trail machines so that these machines can be put into use in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ko likhe taaja patr main jaidi ne yah bhi kaha ki avmaananaa yachika kii sunwaayee karte hue ucchtam nyaayalay ne ayog ko vah samaysima bataane kaa nirdesh diya he jiske bheetar vivipieti kii puri pranali amal main laai jaaegi
 The Chief Election Commissioner did not clarify what he meant by the 'current environment', but it appears that he was referring to the opposition's questioning the credibility of evms
 basapa, aam aadmi party or congress ne ‘gadabad’ iviem ko lekar chunaav ayog par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 16 parties of the country had recently urged to re-introduce ballot system to bring more transparency
 apane patr main jaidi ne yah yaad dilaayaa tha ki vah pehle hi sarkaar ko suchit kar chuke hai ki vivipieti kii aapurti ke liye order farvari, 2017 tak nahin diya gaya to ‘sitambar, 2018 tak vivipieti kii aapurti ke liye vinirmaan mushkil hoga’
 The Election Commission will need more than 16 lakh paper trail machines to cover all polling stations in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 is par 3,174 karod rupee kii laagat kaa anumaan he
 In a letter to the Law Minister dated 22 March, Zaidi said that the Commission informed the Supreme Court that 'the required number of vvpats can be manufactured within 30 months from the release of funds for construction
 ’tippaniyan Chief Election Commissioner Zaidi said, "the process of procurement of VVPAT cannot be delayed given the prevailing environment
 
 The Commission is committed to providing vvpats with evms in future elections so as to increase transparency in the electoral process, preserve voter loyalty and increase voters' confidence in the voting process
 ’’ chunaav ayog june, 2014 se vivipieti ke bare main sarkaar ko kam se kam 11 baar yaad dilaa chukaa he
 Last year, Nasim Zaidi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this context
 beete saat april ko kanoon rajya mantri peepi choudhary ne rajyasabha main ek prashn ke likhit uttar main kaha, ‘‘vivipieti ke sandarbh main chunaav ayog kaa prastaav sarkaar ke paas vichaaradhin he
 '' (NDTV team has not edited this news

 ) mukhya nirvachan ayukta jaidi ne kaha, ‘‘vivipieti kii kharid kii prakriya main maujuuda maahaul ko dekhte hue der nahin kii ja sakati
 
 ayog bhavishya ke chunaavon main iviem ke saath vivipieti muhaiyaa karaane ko patibaddh he taaki chunavi prakriya main paardarshita badhaayi ja sake, matadaata kii nishtha ko surakshit rakhaa ja sake or matdaan kii prakriya main matadaataaon ke bharose ko badhaayaa ja sake
 The Election Commission has reminded the government about VVPAT at least 11 times since June 2014
 pichley saal naseem jaidi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko is sandarbh main patr likhaa tha
 On April 7, Minister of State for Law PP Chaudhary said in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, "the Election Commission's proposal in the context of VVPAT is under consideration with the government

 The country's former Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Arvind Subramaniam has once again questioned the government's GDP growth figures
 iske saath hi arvind subramanyam ne kaha ki jidipi aankadon ko lekar sarkaar ke tark thos nahin hai
 In fact, recently, former CEA Arvind Subramaniam claimed in one of his research papers that the Narendra Modi government at the Center is showing exaggerated GDP growth figures
 is shodhpatr main arvind subramanyam ne daawa kiya tha ki saal 2011-2016 ke dauraan aarthik vruddhi ke anumaan ko 2
 Offered exaggerated to 5 percentage points
 ye wo daur tha jab bhartiya arthvyavastha, niryaat main giravat, company-bank khaaton se judi dohari samasya, sookhaa or notebandi jaisi kai samasyaon ko jhel rahi thi
 According to Arvind Subramaniam, there has been a big fall in the official data on actual debt and real investment to the industry
 lekin 2015 main shuru kii gai nai jidipi shrinkhalaa se pataa chalata he ki in jhatkon ke baavjood jidipi main bahut kami nahin aayi or yah 7
 7 percent to 6
 9 fisadi par aa gai
 This raises the question? Is it possible that these five major adverse shocks would have had such little impact on GDP growth
 sarkaar ne thos jawaab nahin diyasubramanyam ne kaha, ‘‘janvari 2015 main siesao (kendriya sankhyikee karyaalay) ne naye aadhaar varsh (2004-05 ke sthaan par 2011-12), nayaa ankada or naye tareekon ko lekar anumaan jari kiya
 My team and i carefully considered these estimates and immediately raised questions about the new data but despite this no concrete answer was found
 isiilie hamane aatanrik rup se apane andeh jataana shuru kiya or uske baad saarvajanik taur par use uthaaya
 Subramaniam also rejected the government's plea on the basis of which the former cea's claims were rejected
 unhone kaha ki rajg sarkaar ne jiesti or rin shodhan aakshamata or diwaala kanoon jaise sudhaar laae lekin isse madhyam avadhi main vruddhi kaa laabh milegaa
 Subramaniam also rejected the argument of increased productivity, saying that if it had happened, the profitability of the companies would have been increased in the form of more profit
 unhone sarkaar kii khapat main vruddhi kii daleel bhi thukraa di
 The Indian government has strongly objected to the criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an editorial in the US newspaper New York Times for making Yogi Adityanath as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 bhartiya videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa gopal baagle ne is lekh par kaha, 'sabhi sampadakeey yaa vichaar vyaktiparak hote hai
 It is the same in this case
 desh yaa videsh main vishuddh loktantric tareeke se nikle janadesh par andeh karne kii pravriti sawalia nishaan khadey karti he
 'let us tell you that in an article printed' Modi's mistakes from Hindu fundamentalists ', this American newspaper had said that since being elected in 2014, Modi' while appeasing his party's staunch Hindu base, is looking for development and economic progress
 Playing the 'game of deception' by promoting secular goals
 is sampadakeey main saath hi kaha gaya tha ki pradhanmantri modi kii party bhartiya janata party dwaara 'firebrands hindu sanyasi' ko uttar pradesh kaa mukhyamantri bananaa dharmik rup se alpsankhyakon ke liye 'chaunkaane vaale apmaan' jaisaa he

 Since the Aam Aadmi Party government came to Delhi, there has been a situation of confrontation between Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor
 purv uparajyapal najeeb jang ke jane ke baad nae uparajyapal anil baijal se bhi kejariwal sarkaar kaa chhattis kaa aankada rahaa he
 The Kejriwal government alleges that the Lt
 Governor does not allow them to implement public welfare schemes
 aap sarkaar jo bhi kaam karti he, uparajyapal usamen rode atka detii he, kyonki antim aadesh unheen kaa hota he
 The Aam Aadmi Party targets the central government of the BJP under the pretext of Lieutenant Governor
 alji or sarkaar ke bich takaraav kii asli vajah dilli kaa centreshasit pradesh hona he
 Due to this, the Lieutenant Governor appointed as the representative of the Central Government has the right to implement all the mandates and give final seal on any decision of the government
 yahi baat kejariwal ko khalati he or vah saare aarope alji or modi sarkaar par lagaate rahete hai
 Arvind Kejriwal gives these 10 arguments behind this whole confrontation - 1
 chaparasi se lekar adhikariyon kii niyukti, transfar-posting or unke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Therefore, the government servant does not accept the orders of the elected government
 2
 Due to the service department being made under the Lieutenant Governor, guest teachers were not allowed to be appointed and new teachers were appointed
 3
 Not being under the services department, the government could not appoint doctors, paramedical and nursing staff to run many newly created Mohalla clinics
 4
 The government has not been able to take any action against corrupt employees and officials since the anti-corruption Branch was brought under the Lt
 Governor, leading to increased corruption in the government
 isse sarkaar kii bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim ko dhakka laga he

 In his book Playing It My Way, Sachin mentions the incident

 AAP Aam Aadmi Party's newly appointed Law Minister Jitendra Singh Tomarco has come under the scanner for fake degree charges
 unhen hai court ne farji degree maamle main notice diya he
 He is the same Tomar who has been made the Law Minister of Delhi
 angreji akhbaar 'da times of india' main chhapi khabar ke mutabik dilli hai court ne jitendra singh tomars par aarope lagaaya he ki unhone edwocket ke taur par apana registration jaali or farji degree se karavaaya he
 That is, his degree has been directly accused
 tomars ne akhbaar se baatcheet main is aarope ko niraadhaar bataaya he or kaha ki yah dushprachaar pratidwandviyon ne kiya he or mujhe court kaa koi notice nahin mila he
 He also said that if i get any notice, i will file a contempt case against the petitioner and will follow all the legal remedies
 tomars dilli ke trinagar vidhansabha se jite hai
 He said that i have a real degree and i have got a law degree from Chaudhary Charan Singh University
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki dilli hai court ke justise rajeev shakdhar ne isi maheene bharat or dilli ke baar council ke alawa chunaav ayog se tomars kii degree ke bare main poocha he
 Justice Shakadhar, in his order, said that according to the petitioner Jitendra Singh Tomar had obtained a forged degree and on his strength he became a member of the Bar Council of Delhi
 is uddeshy ke liye yachikakarta ne avadh uniwarsity se artiai ke jariye soochna praapt kii he
 He has also issued a notice to the university to reply by 27 April
 apni yachika main santosh kumaar sharma naam ke ek vyakti ne aarope lagaaya ki tomars avadh uniwarsity ke lau graduate nahin hai or unki biessi degree farji he
 So much so that the Institute of Legal Study College from Munger district of Bihar from where Tomar studied law is not in accordance with the norms of Bar Council of India

 Congress General Secretary and in-charge of Eastern Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday made a roadshow in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi to create an atmosphere in favor of party candidate Ajay Rai and realized his political power
 dilachasp baat yah he ki kaashi main congress ambedkar se malviya par shift hoti najar ai
 After this, along with the policy and intent of the Congress in the political corridors, political implications are also being discovered
 bataa den ki kaashi main congress ke ateet ko khangale to ambedkar prem saaf najar aata he
 Most of the roadshows and public meetings of Congress leaders in Kashi have started with garlands at the statue of Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar and from the areas of Yellow Kothi and Chauka Ghat
 2 agast 2016 ko jis road sho ke dauraan congress kii tatkaaleen rashtriya adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii tabiyat bighad gai thi, us sho kii shuruyaat bhi varanasi kachhari main dow
 Ambedkar's statue was garlanded only
 jabaki priyanka gandhi kaa buudhvaar ko road sho pandit madanamohan malviya kii pratimaa par maalyarpan ke saath lanka se shuru hua or samaapan kaashi vishwanath ke darbar pahunch kar puja archana se
 It is worth noting that the Congress politics that has suddenly shifted from Ambedkar to Malaviya in Kashi, a stronghold of BJP for almost three decades, is also that the road show of former Prime Minister Narendra Modi was started from Malviya statue only a few days ago
 priyanka ke road sho kaa root bhi vahi tha jo piem modi kaa
 This is also seen by linking it with Priyanka's recent statement in which she had talked about putting candidates to dent bjp's vote
 congress khud se chhitak kar basapa ke saath ja chuke daliton ko unki asmita ke pratik ambedkar ke sahare apane paale main laane kaa prayaas karti rahi he
 Once the original votebank of the Congress, the Savarnas and especially the Brahmins were seen standing firmly with the BJP after the nineties
 essi-asti act main sanshodhan or teraa point roster ko lekar supreme court kaa faisla sansad main palate jane se savarna samudaay ke bich naaraazgi maani ja rahi he
 The Congress is engaged in the exercise to continuously practice them
 isi kadi main priyanka gandhi is sho ke peeche congress kaa khoyaa hua brahman or savarna vot bank waapas paane kii chatapataahat saaf najar aa rahi he
 In 2014, after Modi's ideal male patriarch Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, PM Modi gave Bharat Ratna to Mahamana Malaviya in his court
 2014 ke chunaav main mahaamanaa ke pote giridhar malviya modi ke prastaavak bhi the
 In such a situation, the Congress did not remember Malaviya, who had beautified her presidency during the slavery period before voting in Kashi this time
 bijepi ke hindutv banaam congress kaa soft hindutwaek taraf bijepi uniphid hindu vot bank banane kii koshish kar rahi he jiske sahare dilli kii gaddi par lambey samay tak kabiz rahaa ja sake to duusari taraf congress is prayaas ko vifal banane kii koshish main soft hindutv kii raah chalati najar ai he
 Whether visiting Rahul Gandhi's temple or now Priyanka's darshan in the court of Kashi Vishwanath and Kashi's Kotwal Baba Kal Bhairav, clearly indicates the changed strategy of the Congress
 piem modi ke khilaaf party ke ummidavaar ajay raay bhi prachaar ke dauraan vishwanath coridor nirmaan ke liye tode gaye mandiron kaa zikr kar hindu asmita jagaakar kaashi kii baaji apane naam karnaa chaahate hai
 Hindutva poster boy how much will Congress be able to challenge PM Modi with the weapon of Hindutva
 yah to 23 may ko hi pataa chalegaa
 But instead of Congress, Tvar has definitely created difficulties in front of BJP, giving the slogan of seven lakh crosses this time

 Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan inaugurated the metro service on Sunday

 The first service of Mumbai Metro has started on the versova-ghatkopar line
 11
 a total of 11 stations will come in this journey of 4 kilometers and this journey will be completed in 20 minutes
 kiraye ko lekar MMOPL or MMRDA ke bich sahmati bhi ban pai he
 The matter has reached the court, although sources say that the minimum fare can be Rs 10 and the maximum fare can be Rs 40
 haalanki, mumbai main metro sevaayen, shuru se hi vivaadon main rahi
 Chavan yesterday said that if Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd
 (mopiel) rajya sarkaar dwaara adhishuchet kiraayon kaa paalan karegi, tabhi vah is seva kaa udghaatan karenge
 However, he later agreed to give the service a green signal
 mopiel ke nideshak devashish mohanti ne kaha tha ki yadi mukhyamantri udghaatan ke liye taiyaar nahin hote hai, to bhi seva kaa shubharambh ravivaar ko hi kiya jayega
 There has been a dispute between the state government and MMOPL over the fare of Metro service for quite some time
 ek taraf kii yatra ke liye oparator ne nunatam kiraaya 10 rupee va adhiktam 40 rupee tay kiya
 The company said that the cost of the project started about eight years ago has increased significantly

 In India's politics, it is often said that the road to power at the center passes through UP
 yahi vajah he ki jab bhi loksabhaa chunaav kii baat aati he to raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa sabase zyada dhyaan upi kii raajnneeti ko samajhane par hota he
 This time the scenario of UP has changed in the Lok Sabha elections
 samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party bijepi se mukaable ke liye saath aa gaye hai
 Efforts are on to bring RLD along
 is gathbandhan kaa chunaav nateezon par kya asar hoga? ajtak ne karvi incits ke saath survey desh kaa mizaaj main ye jaanane kii koshish kii
 The survey was conducted on 2478 people
 ye survey 28 disambar se 8 janvari ke bich kul 20 loksabhaa kshetron main hua he
 The results of the survey are surprising
 yadi loksabhaa chunaav main bispi-espi or areldi gathbandhan saath maidan main utraa to chunaav nattejey 2014 ke nateezon ke bilkul ulat ho jaaenge
 In 2014, the BJP won 71 out of 80 seats in UP, while its allies won two seats
 sapa ko mahaj paanch to congress ko do siten mili thim
 The account of RLD and Bahujan Samaj Party was not even open, but the results of the survey showed that this time it is not going to happen
 agar sapa-basapa or areldi saath chunaav ladate hai to ye gathbandhan upi ke 46 fisadi voton par kabja kar legaa
 Significantly, in 2014, SP got 22
 2 fisadi, bispi ko 19
 6 per cent and RLD got 1 per cent votes
 survey ke nattejey bataate hai ki agar ye teenon partiyaan saath chunaav ladiin to inkaa vot share 2014 ke kul vot share 42
 It will increase from 8 percent to 46 percent which can bring them up to 58 seats in 2019 as compared to five seats in 2014
 is gathbandhan kii safalataa kaa sabase zyada nuksaan bijepi ko hi hoga jiskaa vot share 43
 It will fall from 3% to 36% and the 73 seats it will get will be reduced to 18
 saaf he ki 2014 main modi ko satta tak pahunchaana vaala upi is baar unke va party ke liye buree khabar laa saktaa he
 Another important point appears in the survey
 sapa-basapa or areldi ke gathbandhan kaa congress ko koi khaas nuksaan nahin hone ja rahaa
 His vote share 7
 5 se badhkar 12 fisadi hone kii ummid he jisase 2014 ke do siton ke mukaable wo 2019 main 4 siten jeet sakati he
 There will also be a slight drop in the vote share of other parties
 haalanki pichley chunaav kii tarah unhen yahaan se koi seat milane nahin ja rahi
 These honors reinvigorated the belief that the voice of concern is still heard and appreciated amidst the noise and the journalism of sensation

 You all know the truth

 So i believe it is very embarrassing

 Saif requested to watch the film before making any assumptions about the film

 jiske baad se hi amar singh dobaaraa charchaa main aa gaye hai
 Amar Singh, who became a guest in Aaj Tak's special coverage on Independence Day on Wednesday, commented on the allegation of the opposition's distraction regarding communalism, and said that today i am also distraught, the distraction is because of secularism and communalism in this whole perspective
 The distinction is lost
 unhone kaha ki ham gujarat ke dangon kii baat karte hai or kerani chahie
 
 
 Let us know, Smriti Irani also did it in her time, but in Muzaffarnagar, where our own party was in government, in which i was also but not at that time
 amar singhbole ki mujffarnagar main aise bhayankar dange hue ki gujarat sharmasaar ho jaae
 Even when there were fierce communal riots in the country at the time of independence, there were no riots because the entire social structure of the country is dependent on Hindu Muslims
 jaaton kii jameen he or muslim vahaan shramik hai
 But those carrots were cut like radish
 singh ne kaha ki ab ye dharmanirpekshata or sampradayikta kii nai paribhaasha kya he ki gujarat kaa danga he or mujffanagar kaa danga ajam khan ke netritv main khelkud pratiyogita he

 Singh refused to make any comment about the BJP in the vote-for-vote issue but quipped on members of the Anna Hazare side
 rajyasabha sadsy ne kaha, ‘mulaayam singh yadav yah bataayen ki vah saifai ke hi yadavon yani mulaayam, ramgopal, akhilesh yaa dhamendra yadav ko kyon mukhyamantri pad par dekhnaa chaahate hai
 He should show courage to make any Yadav chief minister from Purvanchal if he gets majority in the upcoming elections

 singh ne kaha, ‘main team anna se sawaal karnaa chahta hum ki kya hazaare pradhanmantri, kejariwal soochna mantri or kiran bedi raksha mantri yaa grih mantri bananaa chaahati hai
 The Hazare-party does not want to offer a political alternative
 jab tak koi vikalp nahin de, tab tak vah bhi bhrasht hi samajha jaayegaa
 Apparently praising the NCP chief, he said, "the Hazare side criticizes Sharad Pawar but he should go to Baramati to see how much he has developed there
" tathakthith bhrasht netaa apane kshetra ke vikaas kaa dhyaan rakhata he?’centre dwaara pashchim bengal sarkaar ko package diye jane ke mudde par unhone kaha ki aarthik khastahali se khaulate pashchim bengal main is package se ubaal kam hoga

 shanti bhushan kii amar singh or sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav se kisi nyaayadhish ke sambandh main baatcheet hone kii ek vivaadaaspad sidi saamne aayi thi
 Singh said, 'since the Delhi Police is saying that the CD is genuine, in which Shanti Bhushan is heard through his son Prashant offering to impress a judge, then he is in Tihar Jail, next to Anna Hazare
 Not in agar ve mujhe jail bhej sakate hai to phir unhen kyon nahin bheja rahaa
 'he said,' Why is Chidambaram afraid of Prashant Bhushan
 ’ singh ne kaha ki prashanth bhushan par jammu kashmir main janamat sangrah karaane kii unki tippanee ko lekar bhi mukadmaa chalanaa chaiye
 He said, 'I condemn the manner in which Bhushan was attacked, but i did not bother because Bhushan insulted the integral part of India and the martyrs of Kargil
