 The court has acquitted 'bhaijaan' from all charges for lack of evidence
 industry ke export amod mehara ne pehle hisalman ke is maamleko lekar kaha tha ki salmaan khan jail jaaenge aisa koi soch bhi nahin saktaa
 He said, 'salman's case is not a matter of any concern
 desh kaa kanoon aisa he ki salmaan ko sajaa hone ke baad bhi jamaanat kaa vikalp milegaa
 'and the talk of Amod Mehra came true Salman got bail
 gusse se laal huin katrina or salmaan ko jamkar sunai khari-khotiek duusare export vinod mirani ne bhisalmaanake hit and ran cese par kaha tha ki agarsalmaan ke paksh main faislanhin aata to unke paas, upree adaalat main apil karne kaa vikalp he

 But listening to the High Court's decision to acquit Salman, a wave of joy must have run among all these veterans

 8 arguments, which are acquitted Salman's decision to make a big gift before his birthday seems to have the effect of his fans' blessings, so sending Bhaijaan to jail was not even under the law
 salmaan kaa is mahine 27 disambar ko janmdin bhi he or is faisle ke baad to yah kahana galat naa hoga ki unhen apane janmdin se pehle hi hit and ran cese se bari hone kaa bada tohfa mil gaya

 rajasthan ke alvar kii ek adaalat ne pahalu khan ke do beton sahit teen logon ke khilaaf gau taskari maamle main unke parivaar ko raahat mil gai he
 Actually, the police had filed the charge sheet five days ago
 jisamen inke khilaaf paaya gaya ki aaropee govenshi kii dhulaai kar rahe the
 With this, the Aspect family requested the police to re-investigate the matter
 jise lekar police adaalat pahunchin or adaalat ne is maamle main police ko phir se jaanch karne ke liye anumati de di he
 According to Aggarwal, the court has approved further investigation in this
 ullekhneey he ki pahalu khan kii ek april 2017 ko kuch kathith gorakshakon ne bahrod (alvar) main pitayee kii thi, baad main aspataal main khan kii maut ho gayi
 Aspect Khan and his sons were going to Nunh with cattle and people suspected of smuggling them
 alvar ke police adheekshak paaris anil deshmukh ne kuch din pehle bataaya tha ki police ne ek maamle kii jaanch ko aage badhaane ke liye sweekruti maangi he
 He informed that investigation on some aspects of the case will be carried forward
 pakistan ke aatanrik maamalon ke mantri rahamaan malik kaa kahana he ki america se kaha gaya he ki vah bharat ko uske desh ke maamalon main hastkshep nahin karne ke liye aagaah kare or unhone bharat par baluchistan main ‘kisi tarah ke aatankwaad’ bhejne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Talking to the CIA director, Mudamalik claimed that President Asif Ali Zardari has been raising the issue from every platform
 unhone kaha, ‘‘siie nideshak ke saath baatcheet main hamane safataur par kaha ki bharat ko chetavanee di jaani chahie
 Whatever we are seeing in Balochistan, we have found that they are supplying some kind of terrorism here and they should stop it
 ’’manmohan-gilaani kii mulaakaat main hua tha zikramalik ne kaha ki pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani or unke bhartiya samakaksh manmohan singh kii mulaakaat ke dauraan baluchistan kaa maamla uthaaya gaya
 "the evidence is that the matter came up in a joint statement but was later dropped," he said
 ’’ malik ne kaha, ‘‘jab bhartiya pradhanmantri waapas laute to bharat main loksabhaa main dabaav tha
 We do not know if there is a super power in India that is not allowing them to move forward
 ’’ No matter how strong the relationship is, there are definitely some challenging situations in every relationship
 aisi sthiti main kai baar mahilaayein halaat se samjhauta kar chupchaap sab kuch sahan karti rahati hai
 But there are some moments or situations in life where women should not compromise
 ab ye samjhauta chahen job ko lekar ho yaa phir aazaadee ko lekar
 Every woman should step out of the chains of relationship and raise voice for these 5 things for herself - 1
 ek rishte main mahilaon ko bhi utani hi aazaadee milani chahie, jitani purushon ko milti he
 That is why you ask for your freedom
 saath hi apanejivanke faisle apni marji se len
 2
 aadhunik jivan main bhi kai logon ko lagata he mahilaayein sirf ghar ke kaam ke liye bani hai
 If your partner also has such thinking, then openly talk to your partner before taking the relationship forward
 3
 If your partner is having trouble with your job after marriage, then talk to the partner beforehand and make a decision carefully
 ek confident mahila ko apnekariyarke saath samjhauta kabhi nahin karnaa chahie
 4
 ek majboot rishta pyaar or vishwaas par tikaa hota he
 If you feel that your partner does not give you the love and respect that you deserve, then you must think about your relationship once
 5
 Give your partner a little time as well as yourself
 isse aap relex or rifresh mahasoos karenge
 Do whatever pleases you, whether partying with friends or reading your favorite book
 iske liye aapako kisi se ijaajat lene kii jarurat nahin he

 jis pani se aap apana cheharaa dhone vaali hai wo bhi aapaki twachaa ke anuroop hi hona chahie
 Many times, there are so many impurities in the water that due to this, the face also fades
 aise main aap cheharaa dhone ke pani ko is tarah se taiyaar kar sakati hai:1
 Washing face with cold water provides coolness and the face also looks bright
 iske liye aap thande pani main kuch barf ke tukade daalkar kuch minute ke liye chhod dijie
 When the ice is almost melted, wash your face with this water
 2
 Washing the face with rice mars is also very beneficial
 par ise thanda karne ke baad hi istemaal karen
 By using this water, the skin of the face not only gets tight, but it is also helpful in cleaning the spots
 3
 Cleaning the face with rose water is always beneficial

 kamalesh tiwari ke naukar ne jab chaay sarv kii to is bich donon logon ne tiwari ke naukar se cigarette or masala laane ke liye kaha
 By the time so many servants returned with spice, the attackers escaped from the scene by carrying out the incident
 naukar ne vaardaat kii kahani bayaan karte hue bataaya ki donon hamalavar bike se aae the
 He claimed that he could identify the attackers better by not taking the bike

 The investigation into the death of labor leader Zafar Khan during the cleanliness drive was banned during open defecation did not proceed even for the fifth day
 isaki badi vajah he ki police jaanch karnaa hi nahin chaahati he
 Instead, the police is engaged in coordinating with the BJP leaders to crack the case
 yahaan tak kii jafar ke postmortem karne vaale doctor bhi bhaag rahe hai
 On the other hand, BJP is getting trapped on its own by making selective videos viral
 pehle kaha tha ki koi marpet nahin hui he or ab jafar ke maarane kaa video jari kiya he
 The mystery of the death of labor leader Zafar Khan is being deepened during a quarrel with a government official and employee during morning defecation in Pratapgarh, Rajasthan
 do din pehle pratapgarh aspataal ke paanch doctoron kii team ne apni postmortem report main maut kii praarambhik vajah cardiyak and risparetary felyor bataaya he
 When the Aaj Tak team wanted to meet him, he did not come to the hospital on all five different excuses
 inke paas is baat kaa jawaab nahin tha ki langs yaa heart main donon main se koun or kya kharaab tha
 After this, the Aaj Tak team started searching for Municipal Chairman Kamlesh Doshi, then it was found that they have gone underground since the incident
 team ne unhen shahar ke divyam hotel main dhundha
 The chairman first took out his anger on 'aaj Tak' and then gave two short videos of Zafar's quarrel
 isamen unhone jafar ke jhagada karte hue, mahilaon ke haath main pathar liye or apane karmchaaree camel jamdar ke sharir par lage khun ke dhabbe dikhaae
 Actually BJP workers are doing viral by editing videos but are getting stuck in it
 unhone ek video jari kar kaha ki jafar ne dhamkiyaan di thi or koi jhagada nahin hua
 But in that video, blood flowed from the nose of the government employee and blood smeared on his shirt
 uske baad ek or video jari kar ab is baat par aa gaye ki jhagada or marpet to hua tha magar keval jafar ne hi sabko maaraa tha
 The chairman said in a conversation that was done in camera and said that we had formed a medical team of five doctors and we were not caught in court
 chairman ne ye bhi bataaya ki usne jafar se jhagade ke baad kis tarah se police or aspataal main phonkar apane logon ko surakshit kiya tha
 The Aaj Tak team was in talks with the chairman at the same time that the investigating officer and SHO entered the room of Divyam Hotel chairman
 esechao sahab 15 minute pehle hi intervyuu dene se ye kehete hue manaa kar diya tha ki hamen jaruri naake main janaa he adhikari kaa phone aa gaya he
 He was sitting with the chairman of the SHO and the investigating officer of the case, Mangilal Vishnoi in the hotel room
 iske baad 'aaj tak' kii team espi shivaraj meena ke paas gai lekin unhone to kisi ko bhi arest karne se hi inkaar kar diya or kaha ki abhi to jaanch jari he
 After that the team was present on the spot and wanted to call the accused Commissioner Ashok Jain to meet him but he refused to meet with an excuse of busyness and started convincing him to watch the video
 bijepine jin paanch logon ke bare main kaha ki jafar ne unhen peeta unamem se sabhi ne milane se manaa kar diya
 What is surprising in this case is that the chairman gave two videos to the team of Aaj Tak and said that we are making it viral and talked to all the people appearing in it, but even after five days the police have no eyewitness not found
 saare logon ne silsilewar bataaya ki jafar chachaa hamaari awaaj sunakar gusse main aae the or pehla waar bhi kiya tha lekin uske baad unhen jameen par giraakar unke sharir par baithkar paanch logon ne lagaataar waar kiya he
 Then everyone ran away
 kisi tarah basti vaale unhen aato main daalkar le gaye
 When the Aaj Tak team started investigating after reaching the hospital, the suspicion deepened
 subah ke 7
 At 30, Zafar Khan was brought to the Emergency and according to the document that we had, he was brought to a dead state
 das minute ke andar unako morchari main discharge kar diya gaya
 But 7
 40 ko katkar morchari bhejnaa 3

 Navjot Singh Sidhu, who resigned from the Punjab cabinet after getting angry, has also been answered by CM Captain Amarinder Singh

 After this, a statement was also issued by Siddoo that he is sending his resignation to the CM of Punjab and on Monday again he informed on Twitter that his resignation has been received by the Punjab Chief Minister's Office
 navjot singh siddhu ke congress main shaamil hote hi unka captain amarinder ke saath 36 kaa aankada ho gaya tha
 Captain wanted to keep him away from the politics of Punjab and even he did not want to keep him in the cabinet, but the Congress high command was at the time over Sidhu and everything was being obeyed
 yahaan tak ki siddhu captain amarinder singh ke vipareet pakistan main imran ke shapathgrahan samaaroh main bhi hissaa lene pahunch gaye
 But things changed after the Lok Sabha elections and Captain Amarinder Singh reshuffled his cabinet and sidelined his department
 yahaan tak punjab asibi kii ore se ek jaanch bhi shuru kar di gai
 Unhappy with snatching the department, Sidhu did not even manage to go to the ministry

 maharashtra kii raajnneeti main is chunaav ke saath kai sanket saamne aae hai
 One of the most important indications of this is that the political influence of MNS chief Raj Thackeray in the politics there has reduced considerably
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main vah bahut charchaa main rahe the
 Experts say that this time Raj Thackeray's decision to not stand for a single seat in support of Narendra Modi just before the Lok Sabha elections cost him dearly
 isse unki party ke kaaryakarta bhramit ho gaye or ve chup baithe rahe
 Therefore, when he stood in the assembly elections, he did not get any special support of the public
 unke paas koi bada mudda bhi nahin tha
 In fact, he used to do politics by cashing in on marathi-non-marathi fights
 ve gaiyr marathiyayon khaskar bihariyon or uttar pradesh ke logon ke khilaaf zehar ugalkar apni jaden majubat kar rahe the lekin dhire-dhire yah aag thandi padane lagi or logon kii isamen dilchaspee kam ho gai
 His slogan of Marathi manush could not be played this time
 2009 ke chunaav main raaj thakare ko bahut publicity mili thi or unhen bala sahab kaa asli uttaradhikari mana jane laga lekin unki yah chhavi kamazor ho gai
 His party has not done anything in the last five years for which he can be remembered
 unhone is dauraan toll tex kaa mudda jarur uthaaya lekin usase puure rajya kii janata ko khaas matlab nahin tha
 Experts say that Raj Thackeray's lifestyle also changed and he became comfortable
 unhone apni party ko koi nai disha nahin di jisase vah aage bad sake
 Now the latest situation is that MNS will be able to win only 4 seats
 isse kuch sabit nahin hota
 He is not in a position to negotiate or offer anything

 kisi bhi devi-devtaa kii puja main sabase pehle sankalp kiya jaataa he
 This is also an essential part of the method of worship
 jyotishiyon ke anusaar agar sahi vidhi-vidhaan se pujan kiya jaae to uskaa fal bahut jald praapt hota he
 That is why whenever a special worship is performed, the help of a Brahmin is taken
 taaki vidhi vidhaan se pujan ko sampann kiya ja sake
 Things to keep in mind in worship - Do not keep lamps, Shivling, Shaligram on the ground-mani, idols of Gods and Goddesses, Yajnopaveet and Shankha on the ground - These things should never be kept directly on the ground
 -ek kapadaa bichhaaen yaa kisi oonche sthaan par in chizon ko rakhana shreshth rahata he
 Keep these things in mind as soon as you wake up in the morning - meditate on the presiding deity as soon as you wake up in the morning - you should see both your palms
 -iske baad adhik samay tak bina nahaye nahin rahanaa chahie
 - Clothes worn at night should be discarded soon
 tay tithi par puraa karen daan kaa sankalp-to sankalp ko tay tithi par kisi bhi paristhiti main puraa karnaa chahie
 - If there is a delay of one day in giving, then double donation should be given
 -yadi ek maah kaa vilamb hota he to daan sauguna ho jaataa he
 - After spending two months, the amount of donation becomes Sahastraguni i
e
 thousand times
 -daan ke liye jab bhi sankalp karen to tay tithi par daan kar dena chahie
 - There should not be any delay in giving donations
 parikrama kaa mahatv-bhagwaan kii murti or mandir kii parikrama hameshaa daahine haath kii ore se shuru karen-pratimaaon main maujuud sakaaratmak urja uttar se dakshin kii ore pravaahit hoti he
 - Revision of the left hand side leads to the collision of the body with positive energy - Due to this, the benefit of the revolution is not available, the right also means the south - due to this, the orbit is also called Pradakshina
 , Circumambulate four of Shriganesh - four of Lord Vishnu and all his incarnations, one of Parikare Karendevi Durga, three of Hanumanji, - The rule is to worship half of Shivaji
 sankalp lene kaa arth-ishtdev or swayan ko sakshi maanakar sankalp liya jaataa he-sankalp lete hai ki pujan karm vibhinn manokamanaayon kii purti ke liye kar rahe hai-sankalp lete hai ki is pujan ko purna avashya karenge
 While taking resolution, water is taken in the hand while taking meditation of Shri Ganesha - because in the Panchamahabhutas of this entire creation i
e
 the fire, earth, sky, air and water
 
 
 -bhagwaan ganpati jal tatv ke adhipati hai
 That is why the resolution of Shri Ganesh is taken
 -taaki shriganesh kii krupa se pujan karm bina kisi baadha ke purna hon-ek baar pujan kaa sankalp lene ke baad us puja ko puraa karnaa aavashyak hota he
 -this tradition strengthens our resolve
 -viparit paristhitiyon kaa saamana karne kaa saahas praapt hota he
 Samajwadi Party MLA Vijay Mishra from Gyanpur (bhadohi) in UP has a total of 60 criminal cases filed but the UP government considers this mla's life as a threat
 yahi vajah he ki vidhayak ke taur par ek ganar or shadow milane ke baavjood inaki suraksha ko badhaakar vaai shrenee kii kar di
 The reason given is that Vijay Mishra's daughter is a SP candidate from Bhadohi Lok Sabha constituency

 During the Ganeshotsav, people are angry with the Varanasi administration's strictness to stop idol immersion
 ab durga puja kaa parv he
 Therefore, the Pooja Committees have reached the court to stop the new ruckus regarding immersion
 isi maamle main ek yachika par shanivaar ko elahabaad hai court main sunwaayee honi he
 In which the Pooja committees will try to prove their position in front of the court that the traditional forms of idols will not cause pollution in the Ganges
 unamurtiyonko ganga main visarjeet karne kii ijaajat di jaae jinhen prakritik chizon se banaaya gaya he
 According to him, it has not yet been kept in the High Court that the idol is established according to the scriptures
 visarjan bhi shastron ke hisaab se behate hue pani main hota he
 When the courts have given decisions in matters related to religion keeping in mind the religious texts, traditions and faith, then where is the demand of the people of Kashi in this case wrong
 darasal hoicourt ke adeshon parganesh murti visarjanrokane vaale prashasan par durga puja ke dauraan durga murti visarjan rokane kii bhi jimmedaari hogi
 The order of the High Court has stated that the main reason behind stopping the Immersion immersion is the use of plaster of Paris and chemical found colors used in the sculptures
 banaras ke murtikaron kaa tark he ki wo parmparik taur par murtiyon ganga se nikaali gai chikani mitti, bans, jute, phoos or prakritik rangon se hi banaate hai
 Apart from this, at the time of immersion, there is such a system that the sailors take out bamboo and rope after the mud of the idols that flow in the Ganges dissolve in the water
 aise main inkaa tark he ki in murtiyon ke visarjan se ganga main pradooshan nahin ho saktaa

 The issue may be discussed at the ICC quarterly meeting in Dubai starting on Wednesday
 pisibi ke adhyaksh ehsaan mani, mahaprabandhak wasim khan or sioo subhaan ahamed vibhinn baithkon or kaaryshaalaaon main bhaag lene ke liye abhi dubai main hai
 The PCB official said, "pakistan believes that if India wants to give a walkover, it cannot do anything on it
" lekin isse sawaal paidaa hoga ki agar donon desh qualifi kar jate hai or phir nokout charan main milte hai to phir kya hoga
 The quarterly meeting is expected to discuss issues such as tax exemption for future global competitions, broadcasting rights to the World Test Championship and limiting representation in private T20 leagues
 isisi kii kai baithkon kii shuruyaat isisi mukhya kaaryakariyon kii samiti (siisi) kii baithak ke saath hogi, jahaan bharat kaa pratinidhitiv bisisiai siio rahul johri karenge
 It will end with a board meeting in which Acting Secretary Amitabh Chaudhary will participate on behalf of India
 jin mukhya muddon par charchaa hogi usamen kar chhot gatirodh, vishwa test championships se jude prasaaran mudde, nijee lig main khilaadiyon ke pratinidhitiv kii seemaa simit karnaa or los angelis 2028 olympic main cricket ko shaamil karana shaamil he
 a key issue is the demand for tax exemption by the ICC for future global competitions in India such as the T20 World Cup in 2021 and the 2023 World Cup
 bisisiai adhikari ke anusaar haalanki maujuuda niyamon ko dekhte hue isaki sambhaavna behad kam he ki isisi ko kisi tarah kii chhot mili or is gatirodh ke jari rahane kii sambhaavna he
 Due to strict vigil on the border by the Border Security Force, smuggling of cow and calf to Bangladesh by land has almost stopped
 haalanki pashu taskar phir bhi baj nahin aa rahe hai
 Following the saying 'tu dal-dal, main paat paat', these smugglers are now smuggling animals through the river leaving the land
 lekin iske liye wo gaay-bail-bachhadon ke upar jo barbarta kar rahe hai, use dekhakar kisi kaa bhi kalejaa munh ko aa saktaa he
 The video, which exposes these inhumane antics of animal traffickers layer by layer, is still available
 video main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki kis tarah gaay, bachhadon ke pehle pair baandh kar unhen puri tarah bebas kar diya jaataa he
 They are then pushed into the river water and beheaded in two trunks of banana
 ye isliye kiya jaataa he ki sir hi sirf pani se baahar rahe or oxigen milte rahane kii vajah se gaay kii maut naa ho
 Then garbage etc
 is also put on it
 ye isliye kiya jaataa he ki baahar se dekhne par aisa hi lage ki nadi main kachra bah rahaa he
 This method is being vigorously adopted for smuggling of cows to Bangladesh in Jhapsabari area of dhubri district of Assam
 gaay samet tamaam pashuon ke upar koi khaas pahchaan yaa code bhi chhap die jate he
 This is done because on reaching the border, the animal reaches the same business for which it is being smuggled
 sthaneey nagarikon ke mutabik biguef javaanon kii ankhon se bachaakar ye taskari kii jaati he
 According to an estimate, 300-400 cows are sent to Bangladesh by river every day from Jhapasabari
 taskar in gaayon ko assam or bangladesh ke pashu vyapaariyon se kharidte hai
 Most cows are brought by road from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana
 pehle inhen pashchim bengal-assam seemaa par analod kiya jaataa he
 The smugglers then decide how to send the cows to Bangladesh
 nadi se taskari ke alaava jameen ke raste bhi gaayon ko seemaa tapa kar bangladesh bheja jaataa he
 However, due to the increased vigilance at the ground border, smuggling has been largely stopped on this route
 sthaneey log in dinon gaay taskaron kii amanviya harkaton ke virodh main khul kar saamne aane lage hai
 According to the local people, these smugglers are so fearless that when stopped they sometimes even confront the BSF
 logon kaa kahana he ki haal ke dinon main gaayon kii bangladesh ko taskari bad gai he
 Let us know that till today the Special Investigation Team had turned to Assam with intelligence cameras and opened many layers of cow smuggling
 tab ye saamne aayaa tha ki bangladesh main bhartiya gaayon kii munh maangi keemat milti he
 According to an estimate, about three and a half lakh cows are sold from India every year by crossing the Bangladesh border secretly
 taskari kaa salanaa kaarobaar 15 hajaar karod rupee se zyada kaa he
 According to the Home Ministry, during 2014 and 2015, BSF killed 34 cow smugglers in an encounter
 assam gaay taskari kaa hot spot he
 Bangladesh has a 263 km long border from here
 yahi border assam se gaayon ko bangladesh pahunchane kaa root banataa he
 The average price of a cow here is up to 55 thousand rupees
 assam border paar karavaate hi bangladesh main gaay kii keemat 1 lakh rupee tak ho jaati he
 This is because there is a lot of demand for beef in Bangladesh
 isi baat kaa munafa gotskar uthaate hai

 According to the study, India's population is projected to reach 170 crores by 2050, under which the number of children (children below 15 years) will be reduced by 20% in the next 32 years, while the age of 65 years The number of people will increase up to three times

 In comparison, the ratio of growth rate of people over 65 years will increase from 6 to 13 percent

 The Health Expert believes that to reduce the widening gap between the elderly and the young, the country is missing a replacement population, so two parents are not being replaced by the same number of children, so this difference may be short-term
 But it will continue like this

 Mulayam's intention behind the party's 'desh bachao-desh Banao' rally in Bareilly on 21 November is to further strengthen the party's hold among Muslims in the Rohelkhand region

 The joy of victory is always good
 yah puri team ke prayaas se mili lekin yah durbhagyapurna rahaa ki ham shrinkhalaa pehle hi haar chuke the
 "apart from bowlers, the role of Indian fielders was very important in the defense of this small score, while Dhoni added praise," the fast bowlers gave us a good start

 We saved 20 to 22 runs from our fielding which are important in low-scoring matches
 hamane ek kaich choda lekin aisa ho jaataa he
 India replaced Ajinkya Rahane in place of opener Virender Sehwag, who struggled with poor form, but the team once again failed to get a good start

 However, the season in which matches are being played helps the fast bowlers and Pakistan's bowling attack is quite good
 ’bhartiya captain se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya 167 ran kaa score kaaphi tha to unhone kaha, ‘hamen pataa tha ki 168 ke aasapaas ran kaaphi nahin hone vaale
 We decided that we would not look at the scoreboard which helped
 gendbaajon ne kaaphi anushaasit gendbaaji kii
 At such a time, fast bowlers try to experiment a lot and throw short balls but today they bowled at one place
 ’ sahvaag ko is match main nahin khilaane par dhoni ne kaha ki yah badlaav antim lamhon par kiya gaya
 He said, 'this change was made in the last moments in the last XI
 kabhi kabhi kuch chijen aapke haath main nahin hoti

 Addressing an event at King's College London, Rajan was discussing the steps ahead for the Indian economy amid a slowing economy and rising unemployment
 rajan ne kaha, ‘‘jo samasyaayein hai
 
 
 One of them is, i have said very strongly that suppressing criticism means that you do not listen to feedback and, if you do not listen to feedback, you cannot take the right steps at the right time
 ''unhone kaha, ‘‘isliye, sabhi aalochakon se kahana ki sarkaar kii aalochana naa karen, mujhe lagata he ki yah sarkaar ke liye bura he
 Everyone may praise you and say that you are the second Messiah, but this will not create the kind of consciousness that you want within the government

 There are a lot of economists and intelligent people in India who can give advice
 lekin yah mahatvapurn he ki sarkaar us salaah ko apanaae or us par vichaar-vimarsh tathaa karrwai kare

 Not only BJP but Samajwadi Party is also raging on Rahul's statement
 bijepi ne kaha he ki rahul gandhi ke dange karwaane vaale bayaan ke khilaaf chunaav ayog main shikaayat karegi
 While Azam Khan, the leader of the Samajwadi Party, which links Muslim and ISI, has also asked Rahul Gandhi to withdraw his statement
 sapa or bijepi ne virodh kiya to jediu ne naseehat de di or kaha ki rahul hon yaa modi kisi ko aisi bhashaa kaa istemaal karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 On one hand, the opponents are attacking, so far Rahul has not been able to openly support his loved ones
 sarkaar philhal rahul ke iesai vaale bayaan par kuch bhi kehane se batch rahi he
 Even today, when Home Minister Sushil Shinde was asked about this statement, he refused to say anything
 rahul gandhi ne musalamaanon kaa apmaan kiyah ajam khansapa netaa ajam khan ne kaha, 'rahul gandhi ne musalamaanon kaa apmaan kiya he
 He has been charged severely
 unhone musalamaanon ke saath anyaay kiya he
 He should be clarified on this statement
 is bayaan kaa khandan karnaa chahie
 Rahul Gandhi should tell the country that he said such a thing for political reasons, it has nothing to do with the truth
 'rahul ne musalamaanon ko iesai se jodah shahanvaj husseinbijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain ne kaha ki rahul gandhi musalamaanon ko iesai se jod rahe hai

 rahul ne apmanjanak bhashaa kaa istemaal kiyah jediujediu netaa kasee tyaagi ne kaha, 'rahul gandhi ne alpsankhyakon ke liye apmanjanak bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya
 Whether it is Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi, no one has the right to use such language on the basis of religion

 Continuing this tradition further, Rahul Baba stamped 'made in ISI'
 kya secular bhaavana he
 'it was Rahul Gandhi's controversial statement on Thursday when he was in Indore, but he remembered Muzaffarnagar
 rahul ne kaha ki khufia vibhaag ke afasar ne unhen bataaya he ki iesai mujffarnagar dangon ke peediton ko bargalane kii koshish main he
 Rahul said that the Pakistani agency was in contact with the riot victims of Muzaffarnagar

 He said, 'I myself have spoken to 15-20 aggrieved youths
 ' Within 15 days of the fall of the Mehbooba Mufti government in Jammu and Kashmir, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the largest party in the state, is moving towards a possible breakdown
 pidipi ke teen vidhayakon ke khulkar mahabuuba mufti ke khilaaf jane ke baad lagbhag 15 vidhayak, party ke kriyakalapon se asantusht bataae ja rahe hai
 It is believed that they can form a government with the BJP, in this front being formed in PDP against Mehbooba, Imran Raza Ansari, MLA from Patan of North Kashmir, is being told as the main architect
 bataa den imran raja ansaari ne mahabuuba par parivaarwaad ko badhaava dene kaa aarope lagaate hue hamalaa bolaa tha
 If sources are to be believed, Ansari is also getting support from many disgruntled mlas of PDP

 In view of the changing political developments, the National Conference demands that the Assembly be dissolved to avoid horse-trading

 PDP MLA Imran Raza Ansari is considered close to Sajjad Lone and former Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu
 gauratlab he ki haseeb drabu ne bhaajapa-pidipi gathbandhan sarkaar banane me ram madhav ke saath ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 So if a section of PDP breaks away from the party and forms the government with BJP, then the trio of drabu-lon-ansari will prove to be important players in this game
 haseeb drabu ko haal hi me kashmir ko saamaajik samasya qaraar ko lekar khadey hue vivaad kii vajah se vitt mantri kaa pad chhodana padaa tha
 What does the mathematics of forming a government say? In the 87-member Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly, there are 28 mlas of the PDP, 25 of the BJP, 12 of the Congress, 15 of the National Congress, 2 of the People's Congress and the rest of the Independent mlas

 Seven years ago on 16 January 2008, Govinda slapped one of his alleged fans, the echo of that slap is once again heard
 supreme court ne chaante ke is video clip ko dekhakar govinda ko unke kathith fain se maafi maangane ke liye kaha he
 After this, Govinda came in front of the media and questioned only the alleged fan Santosh Rai that with whose help he kept fighting the case in court for so many years
 unhone kaha, aisa shaks unka fain nahin ho saktaa
 Govinda said at the press conference called at his home, 'I respect the court's decision
 puraa court order aane dijie phir bataaungaa mujhe kya karnaa he
 But the important question is, who was helping him for so many years? Who funded him to fight this case for so many years? i have not done any case on my behalf

 com / pvwmuafboz— Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi)august 13, 2019padtaal se yah saaf he ki viral video rahul gandhi ke haalia vynad daure kaa nahin he
 This video is about four months old
 jab bhi kisi grand slam ke final-semifinal main roger federer khel rahe hote hai, to hamaare daftar main sabaki ankhen tivi set se chipak jaati hai
 The same was in the US Open final
 shaayad duusare daftaron main bhi yahi haal hota ho
 After all, the fight between Novak Djokovic and Federer is breath-taking 
 arthur esh tennis kaa hardcourt or duniya ke do sabase behtareen khilaadiyon ke bich muqabla vaaki main dilachasp lag rahaa tha
 However both the players were not seen to be around their best game
 baavjood apni bhalaa kii teji ke bekhend ritern ke federer, jokovich kii shandaar court kawarej ke saamne kabhi-kabhi asahaay najar aa rahe the
 Federer was trying to be aggressive on his behalf and in this attempt, there were also many errors committed by him
 ahm maukon par ve ank ganvaate rahe or dhire-dhire jokovich match set jeetne ke kareeb aa gaye
 When they were leading 5–2 in the fourth set, Federer won two sets with a surprise
 lekin jokovich 10 grand slam jeetne vaale khilaadiyon main shaamil ho chuke the
 After Federer's defeat, a young girl present in the office almost mumbled, asking why this happens to Federer every time
 ek saathi ne kaha, yaar is baar to federer ko jeetna chahie
 Not only this, our senior said as soon as he came to the office that Federer should retire now, because he does not want to see Federer losing
 shaayad kai tennis phens aisa sochate hon
 After all, it has been three years, two months and five days, winning the last Grand Slam in the tennis world, with Federer winning the most 17 Grand Slam titles
 jinhone 2004 se 2008 ke bich unhen 12 grand slam khitaab jitate hue dekha he, un sabko lagata he ki federer ko ab alavida kah dena chahie
 Federer has reached that point long ago, where he has been called 'legend', 'alltime Greatest' in the world of tennis
 to ab federer kya kar rahe hai
 You will also think about this question
 lekin pehle federer kaa yues open main haar ke baad kaa jawaab to sun lijie
 Federer said, 'I was playing in the right direction
 ' ek minute thaharkar jokovich kii raay bhi sun lijie
 He said of Federer that even after winning 17 Grand Slam titles, Federer's game is improving
 federer ke sanyas kii baat karne se pehle jaraa sochiega, 34 saal kii umr main aaj ke power tennis main top level par khilne ke liye kitni urja chahie, kitna damakham chahie
 Also think how many rackets and tennis balls would Federer waste in practice to stay at that level
 ve apane khel main sudhaar ke liye racket badal chuke hai
 Have added the coach with you
 achaanak nae-nae shots kii izaad kar lete hai
 It is this hunger that makes Federer Federer
 unhen yakeen he ki wo abhi bhi 18waan grand slam khitaab jeet sakate hai
 Whether they win or not, time will tell, but the fact is that Federer still remains number two among the world's best tennis players
 hamaara number van khilaadi number 2 ban gaya he
 Its pain also does not reduce
 uske number van hone kii ummid bhi nahin he, lekin wo ise anjavaay kar rahaa he
 So let her enjoy it
 jab wo sanyas lenaa chahega, le legaa
 That time is also not far away
 tab tak shant or saumy tennis ke is fankaar ko dekhte rahiye
 Perhaps many tennis fans think so
 aakhir beete teen saal, do maheene or paanch din ho gaye, tennis kii duniya main sabase zyada 17 grand slam khitaab jeet chuke federer ko aakhri grand slam jite hue
 Those who have seen him win 12 Grand Slam titles between 2004 and 2008 all feel that Federer should say goodbye now
 federer us mukaam par aakhir bahut pehle hi pahunch chuke hai, jahaan unhen tennis kii duniya main 'lijend', 'oltime greatest' kaha jaataa rahaa he
 So what is Federer doing now
 is sawaal par aap bhi sochiega
 But first listen to Federer's answer after the US Open loss
 federer ne kaha, 'main sahi disha main khel rahaa tha
 'pause for a minute and listen to the opinion of Djokovic
 unhone federer ke bare main kaha ki 17 grand slam khitaab jeetne ke baad bhi federer kaa khel sudhar rahaa he
 Before you talk about Federer's retirement, just think, at the age of 34, how much energy is needed to play at the top level in today's power tennis, how much power is required
 ye bhi sochiega ki us str par bane rahane ke liye federer abhyaas main kitne racket or tennis ball barbaad kar dete honge
 They have changed the racket to improve their game
 coach ko apane saath joda he
 Suddenly, they invent new shots
 yahi wo bhukh he, jo federer ko federer banaati he
 He is sure that he can still win the 18th Grand Slam title
 ve jitate hai yaa nahin, ye to samay batayega, lekin hakeekat yahi he ki federer abhi bhi duniya ke sarvshereshth tennis khilaadiyon main number do bane hue hai
 Our number one player has become number 2
 iskaa dard bhi kam nahin hota he
 He is not even expected to be number one, but he is enjoying it
 to use anjavaay karne dijie
 When he wants to retire, he will take it
 wo vakt bhi dur nahin he
 Till then keep watching this fun and quiet tennis fun
 is abhiyaan ko lok sangrah abhiyaan kaa naam diya gaya he
