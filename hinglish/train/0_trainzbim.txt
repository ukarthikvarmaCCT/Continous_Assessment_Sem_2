 Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa said on Saturday that he would complete his term
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki bhaajapa ko phir se satta main laana unki jimmedaari he or vah "apni antim saans tak" bhaajapa kii majbootee ke liye kaam karte rahenge
 Assuming his current tenure as more challenging, he also targeted Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah for calling himself a "weak Chief Minister" and giving 'zero' points to the government's performance so far
 unhone kaha, "main apni antim saans tak party kii majbootee ke liye kaam karuunga
 i do not want any position
 log jaanate hai ki main koun hum
 "the Chief Minister said in an interview to 'pti-bhasha'," i will work to further strengthen the party and it is my responsibility to bring it back to power
 " rajya kii bhaajapa nit sarkaar ne shanivaar ko apane 100 din puure kar liye
 In such a situation, Yeddyurappa expressed confidence of completing the tenure of his current government
 unhone kaha ki unhen alaakaman, sheersh netaaon, vidhayakon or kaaryakartaaon kaa puraa bharosa hasil he
 Siddaramaiah on Friday gave a 'zero' mark to the Yeddyurappa-led government and termed him as a weak Chief Minister
 siddharamaiya par nishaanaa sadhate hue yediurppa ne kaha purv mukhyamantri kaa aacharan or jis tarah se vah simaaen laangh rahe hai, vah puri tarah se unke ahankaar ko darshata he
 He said that he (siddaramaiah) is saying that he will give zero marks to my government
 wo ank dene vaale koun hai
 The public will give me points
 
 
 netaa pratipaksh ke taur par vah raajnneetik kaarnon se janata ke bich bhram paidaa karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 He said, "siddaramaiah was the first chief minister and now the leader is the opposition
 congress ko loksabhaa chunaav main kitni siten milin? sirf ek
 "he said that people (siddaramaiah) have already given you marks
 bijepi ne ek hairat bhare faisle main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye matdaan prakriya subah shuru ho chukne par yani, 7 april ko apana chunaav ghoshnaa patr jari karne kaa elaan kiya he
 Party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman denied these speculations with the information stating that there was a delay in release of some senior party leaders due to differences over certain issues for inclusion in the manifesto
 is baar bijepi ne na sirf apana ghoshnaa patr jari karne main deree kii, balki vah use us samay jari karegi, jabaki us din subah matdaan shuru ho chuke honge
 Before the manifesto, the BJP will issue a 'charge sheet' against the Congress-led UPA regime on Friday afternoon
 isamen upie ke 10 saal ke shashan ke dauraan hue bhrashtachar, ghotaalon or arthvyavastha ke kathith kuprabandhan kaa khulaasa kiya jayega
 Usually political parties issue their manifestos until one week before the election
 congress 26 march ko apana ghoshnaa patr jari kar chuki he
 The first phase of voting for the Lok Sabha elections will begin on 7 April and the last and the ninth phase will be held on 12 May next month
 7 april ko assam kii 5 or tripura kii ek seat ke liye subah 7 baje matdaan shuru ho chukaa hoga
 Sitharaman called those reports 'rubbish'
 jinamein kaha ja rahaa he ki ghoshnaa patr main kuch muddon ko shaamil karne or kuch ko shaamil nahin karne ko lekar ghoshnaa patr samiti ke pramukh murali manohar joshi or narendra modi ke bich matbhed hai
 He claimed that the delay was due to lack of coordination between senior party leaders engaged in campaigning to get one place and one place at a time
 rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) ke mahasachiv bhaiyyaji joshi ne sansad se naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak paarit hone par brihaspativaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi or kendriya grih mantri amit shah ko badhai dete hue ise ‚Äòsaahasik kadam' bataaya
 Joshi said that it has always been a side of the RSS that Hindus who come to India after persecution from other countries should be seen as refugees, not infiltrators
 is vidheyak main pakistan, afghanistan or bangladesh ke gaiyr muslim sharnaarthiyon ko naagarikta dene kaa praavdhaan he or yah rajya sabha se buudhvaar ko paarit ho chukaa he
 The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on Monday
 samvaadadaataaon se joshi ne is vidheyak ke paarit hone ko ‚Äòsaahasik kadam' bataaya or bhaajapa nit centre sarkaar, pradhanmantri or grahamantri ko dhanyavad diya
 "there has always been a stand of the RSS that Hindus who come to India due to persecution in other countries should not be considered as intruders but refugees and it is imperative that these refugees get a dignified life and equal rights," he said
 lekin kaaphi samay biit gaya or sharnaarthiyon ko lambii pratiksha kerani padi
 "joshi said that the present government has taken 'best step'
" yah gyaan mujhe ek skool main mila, haalanki vah meraa skool nahin tha
 It was July when i was called to present the award to students at the prestigious School of Culture in Delhi
 vahaan mahaan logon ke vichaaron vaale poster lage the jinamein ek main asaamaanya rup se ek aankh vaale israeli general moshe dayaan kaa bhi ek uddhran tha, ''agar aap aman chaahate hai, to doston se nahin, dushmano se baat karen
 "later i searched Google and found that the quote was correct
 pashchim asia main jang or aman ke varshon ko khangalate hue main kai or dilachasp uddharanon se gujara
 One such unexpected quote on Aman was found by the Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Mayer, "A leader who does not hesitate to throw his country into battle is not fit to be a leader
" ‚Äùaap kahenge ki pashchim asia ke itihaas main hamen bhatakane kii kya jarurat jabaki hamaara dhyaan japan, china, america, yahaan tak ki thodaa-bahut nepal, australia or uske uranium par hona chahie jo sab ke sab apane paale main aa chuke hai or zyaadaatar tippaneekaron samet media (khaskar samachar channel) haaf-hanfakar ise hamaari nai sarkaar or uske pradhanmantri kii videsh niti kii jeet bataa rahaa he? narendra modi jab america ko prabhavit karne main jute hue hai, ain usee maukey par aisi badmajaagi kii kya jarurat?aisa isliye kyonki videsh niti kaa matlab sirf shikhar sammelnon or videsh dauron kii chamak-damak nahin he
 Also because the total sum of India's high-level diplomacy is still strategic
 is baat ko modi samajhate hai or yah sweekaar karne main hamen koi hichak bhi nahin honi chahie
 That is why Modi's first major tour seems to be in Japan and at the same time as China's Xi Jinping was landing in Ahmedabad, the new capital of Indian rule, Pranab Mukherjee is found in Vietnam
 matlab ki do deshon kii rajdhaniyon main jab ham jhanda fahraa rahe the us vakt khud beijing ke prati hamaare man main baari shankaa thi
 China did not miss any message
 usne jaisi pratikriya di, uske liye ham taiyaar nahin the
 He made such a coincidence that with the arrival of Xi, about a thousand PLA armed soldiers entered the Chumar area of ladakh
 is karrwai kii prakruti or iske vakt ko samaj paanaa bharat ke japan or vietnam daure jitna hi aasaan tha
 The PLA was just showing its stamina to quell Xi's visit, this kind of concoction can only convince the gang of China-devotees and ultra-radical hullahs who are suffering from anti-pakistan and who feel That every army there is equally strong while every leader is Asif Ali Zardari
 bharat ke unmaad bhare ruudhivaadee maahaul main aisi kalpanaaen badi aasaani se feet ho jaati hai or itane lambey samay baad hue desh ke gambhirtam kootnithik apmaan ko bhi halkaa karne kii koshish karti hai
 And all this is happening when we have finally elected a strong leader
 china ne hamaare gubaare kii hawa nikaalane ke liye apane daure kaa istemaal kiya
 He walked around comfortably on what we consider to be his land, while our new Prime Minister, celebrating in his hometown, smiled at his President
 agar china kii jagah pakistan hota tab bhi kya ham isi dhairya kaa parichay dete?vahaan to ham itane jajbaati ho jate hai ki unke rajanyik ke hurriyat netaaon ke saath chaay pine par hi vaarta radd kar daalate hai
 That is, if the younger neighbor does even the slightest audacity then give him Latia, but if the bigger one slaps, then forward the other cheek
 yahi hamaari kootnithik kaaryastylee he
 Modi is a very clever leader
 ve morrkhtaa nahin karte, na hi bhram main rahete hai
 They should know that China had to attack us in 1962 to show who is more powerful
 aaj shi ne sirf teen din ke daure main yahi sabit kar daalaa
 This means that Modi will continue to have this thing in America for five days
 main bharat ke sarvocch rashtriya (ranneetik) hit ke chaar stambhon ko yahaan kram se doharaana chaahunga
 First, there should be no more reduction in the land area of india
 doosraa, dakshin asia main uski mahatta ko chunauti nahin milani chahie balki use baduya chahie
 Third, India's global stature should increase
 or chauthaa, apane atomi astron tathaa mixilon par uskaa purna niyantran va swaittata honi chahie
 China has shaken off the first three pillars and has given us the message that it does not matter much about the fourth
 mujhe vastav main ek or gambhir shaq ho rahaa he ki usne is tarah bharat main aae nae atirashtravaadi ubhaar ko bhi chunauti di he or hamen yaad dilaayaa he ki ham ab tak paryaapt dakshinpanthi nahin ban sake hai
 It forces India to see its image in a completely different strategic perspective
 modi philhal america main hai or is baat se sachet hai ki unke ubhaar ne jahaan nayaa aatmavishvaas paidaa kiya he vahiin hamaari takat or kamajoriyaan bilkul waisi bani hui hai jaisi unke purvavarti ke daur main thim
 Election changes the government and changes the mood of the nation, but it does not change the geopolitical truths
 yah kadi mehnat, dhairya or thande dimag kii maang karata he
 There is a tendency in China's antics that it tests India's resolve
 agar main yah kahuun ki pichhali sarkaar aise hi uksaavon se kaaphi kushaltapurvak or sankalp ke saath nibati thi, to main achche se waakif hum ki log bhadak jaaenge
 When China had almost warned India (november 2009) of stopping the Dalai Lama's visit to Tawang (november 2009), India responded with an eye to eye
 may 2013 main lee kekiyang ke bharat daure par jab seemaa par atikaraman hua tha to sarkaar ne kaha tha ki yatra jari rakhni he to piele ilaaka khaali kare
 Obviously, this time the Chinese did not miss any chance
 shi ke bharat main aate hi khel shuru hua or ek rashtradhyaksh ko waapas bhejne kaa matlab takreeban yuddh kii ghoshnaa jaisaa hota
 In a rare dialogue with the editors, Manmohan Singh explained India's strategic crisis like a tall political leader
 yah samvaad prakashit karne ke liye nahin tha lekin ek sampadak ne ise agle din kii hedline bana daalaa
 That is why i am not breaching any faith by mentioning this thing now
 unhone kaha tha ki bharat ko uski jad main rakhane ke liye china ek bahut sasti ''trikoniya‚Äù niti apanaataa he
 In short, this means the use of Pakistan to upset our balance and thereby increase our dominance by reducing our dominance
 jab tak pakistan hamen fansaae rakhata he, tab tak china ko hamaare saath seemaa vivaad sulajhane kii koi jarurat nahin dikhaai detii
 From Rakhi to Turbine, China values india as only one market for its cheap products
 pichley aankade bataate hai ki bharat main china kaa pratyaksh videshi nivesh poland se bhi kam tha
 In this way, China decides its relationship with us with pure unilateral trade, while Pakistan uses it to determine our strategic extent
 is tarah vah aaraam se rahata he
 To get out of this chakravyuh, India will have to make new advances
 may 2014 ke baad ke maahaul main yah bahut inkulabi vichaar jaan pad saktaa he, lekin aisa he nahin
 The only way to get out of this triangle is to first step forward towards Pakistan and resolve its pending matters with the rest of the neighbors, including the issue of land dispute with Bangladesh
 ham jaanate hai ki pakistani sahyog nahin karte or unke yahaan kii satta sanrachana uljhi hui he
 But India and the rest of the world have more opportunities to benefit from there than China
 america ke daure par modi ke dimag main sabase pehali praathamikta aman ke liye ek vaishvik gathjod kaayam karnaa honi chahie taaki pakistani siyasat or samaaj ke charitra ko badla ja sake
 This is the most shared ideal among the global ideals and India will need an alliance around the US, and who needs to do the same with China in the long run
 yah bilkul vahi ranneeti he jis par vaajapeyi-brijesh mishra or manmohan-shankar menon kii jodiyon ne ateet main kaam kiya he or donon hi maamalon main pakistan ke saath kuch kamyaabi bhi mili he
 The immediate need is that India should quietly take diplomatic steps to restore dialogue with Pakistan and also adapt the public perception towards its most important neighbor in the same direction
 aaj iskaa ulataa ho rahaa he jab ham sabase ahm padosi kaa muhaavara china ke liye istemaal karke khud ko hi rijhaate hai, lekin shi or chumaar prakaran ke baad ham jaan gaye hai ki china ko isse koi fark nahin padataa, na hi use hamaare atomi hathiyaaron kii koi chintaa he
 They are sure to laugh at us when the combat corps is deployed in the eastern mountains without artillery
 ab ham shuruyaat main bataae donon pramukh israeliyon ke uddharanon ko sahi pariprekshya main rakh sakate hai
 If you want peace then you will have to talk to your enemies, among whom the most difficult enemy will have to talk first
 nai sarkaar or uske voter israel kii medha ke prashansak hai
 If the most successful military leaders of Israel are telling you to go, talk to the enemy, be alert to the consequences of war, then you can understand that you have to rethink

 ' Such a strict action against cartoonist Aseem Trivedi is being questioned
 aseem trivedi ke paksh main alag‚àíalag dalon ke log or saamaajik kaayakarta khadey ho chuke hai
 He says that freedom of speech in democracy cannot be guarded like this
 sarkaar kaa kahana he bolne kii azaadi thik he lekin rashtriya pratikon kii maryaada kaa khyal rakhaa janaa chahie
 Information Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni said on Monday that cartoonists are artists
 unhen sanvaidhanik lakshmana rekha kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 They should not make the symbols of the Republic of India the basis or subject of their cartoons
 udhar, cartoonist maanate hai angrejon ke jamaane se chale aa rahe ek kanoon kii bina par aisi karrwai loktantr ke liye khataranaak he
 Indian cartoonist Rajendra Dhodpkar told NDTV that accusing Aseem of treason is foolish, it is not a democratic way
 abhivyakti ke maamalon ko pulisia tareeke se nahin niptaana chahie
 Ambikesh Mahapatra, who has been facing punishment for taking forward Mamta Banerjee's cartoon some time ago, sees this as a growing intolerance of the government
 kanoon ke jaankaron ke mutabik pratik chihnon kaa aisa istemaal kanoonee taur par galat ho saktaa he lekin loktantr kii azaadi kaa sawaal zyada ahm he
 Sanjay Parekh, a law expert, believes that the provision of treason should be removed from the constitution because it is being misused
 aseem trivedi kii giraftaar ke baad abhivyakti kii azaadi kii seemaa tay karne ko lekar desh main ek nai bahes chhid gai he
 There are mainly two types of questions arising after the controversy
 
 
 pehla kya bolne kii azaadi aseemit honi chahie or doosraa ki kya is tarah ke maamalon se nipatane ke liye maujuuda kanoon puraane ho chuke hai
 Can a co-operative bank deposit Rs 750 crore within five days, this can be changed
 sahi baat he ki iskaa pramanik jawaab mere paas nahin he phir bhi ek prayaas kar sakate hai jise aap kayaas bhi kah sakate hai
 Is it possible that first we find out how many note counting machines kept in banks count in one hour or in 12 hours
 bainkon main aam taur par kaisier ke paas note ginaney kii ek hi mashin hoti he
 Generally, a branch has only one cashier
 to vah kitne note us mashin se gin saktaa he? No true scale could be found for how many notes counted by a machine in an hour
 kuch kaitiyaron se baat kii to unhone kaha ki ek note kii gaddi ko ginaney main ek se do minute kaa samay lagata he
 If the old notes are dirty, then it has to be decorated again, that is, all the notes have to be kept in one direction and have to look from here and there, it takes a minute or two
 ek gaddi main 100 note hote hai
 The new pack is counted quickly, but the old notes pack takes some time
 hazaar rupee kii ek gaddi main ek lakh hote hai
 Cashiers stated different amounts
 ek ne kaha ki ek branch main ek kaisier hota he, vahaan aap ek din main bhi 10 karod se zyada nahin gin sakate
 According to this it is very difficult to count Rs 750 crore in 5 days
 ek or kaisier ne kaha ki mashin se ginaney ke liye nae noton ke packet taiyaar hone chahie lekin 750 karod teen se paanch dinon main mumkin nahin he
 i consider my speed very good, yet it is not possible for me
 is kaisier ne bataaya ki 10, 11, 12, 13 november 2016 ko apane chaar saathi kaisier lekar hai efficiensi vaali mashiinon par noton ko gina tha tab chaar log chaar dinon main maatr 26 karod hi gin paae the
 The four had counted from 8 am to 10 pm
 is lihaaz se nahin lagata ki ek branch main itane note jamaa ho sake honge
 Cashiers cannot be believed
 kaisier ne yah bhi bataaya ki sirf ginana hi nahin hota he
 500, 1000 has to be fed into the account
 asli-nakli pahchaanana hota he
 If they have to make different packets or bundles then it takes time
 ab ham nahin jaanate hai ki notebandi ke dauraan paanch dinon main 750 karod ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank ke ek branch main jamaa hua yaa phir alag-alag branchon main
 It has 190 branches in three districts
 agar alag-alag branchon main jamaa hua hoga to ho saktaa he
 Then when it came to know that there are 190 branches, we talked to some cashiers that if 750 crore can be deposited in 190 branches in five or six days, then i want to tell you the account they have sent
 750 karod kaa matlab he 1000 rupee ke 40,000 packet or 500 rupee ke 80,000 packet
 In this way, there are about 125 lakh packets of 500 and 1000
 sava lakh packet ginaney ke liye ausatan 500 se 800 kaisier or itani hi mashine chahie
 Co-operative banks do not have this much facility
 190 branch ke hisaab se ausat 4 karod prati branch hota he jo sahakaari bank main jamaa mumkin nahin he
 Does Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank have 500 to 800 cashiers? How many note counting machines were there at that time? This bank is expanded in three districts
 Will there be 500 cashiers in three districts? You are not feeling anything strange but you cannot say anything with the claim because all this can be revealed only after investigation
 vaise kai kaitiyaron se baat karne par pataa laga ki ek note ginaney kii mashin lagaataar bhi kaam kare to teen se chaar ghante ke baad ten bol detii he
 That means it gets hot after that it starts counting less
 kaam rokna hota he or mashin ke mentanence waalon ko bulaanaa padataa he
 Not only this, when the cashier takes money from someone, he also talks to a consumer, tells him
 isliye sara kaam ek se do minute main nahin ho saktaa he
 i am talking about the note counting machine because on 21 June, Business Standard, Economic Times, Moneylife

 NABARD also said that Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank has the country's top cooperative institution which has recently received the Best Performance Award
 to aaj jitna hua utana aapke saamne he
 Now we do not know whether in five days during demonetisation, 750 crores was deposited in one branch of Ahmedabad district cooperative bank or in different branches
 isaki teen zilon main 190 branch hai
 It may happen if it has accumulated in different branches
 phir jab ye pataa chalaa ki 190 branch hai to hamane kuch kaitiyaron se baat kii ki kya 190 branch main 750 karod paanch yaa chah din main jamaa ho saktaa he, to unhone jo hisaab bheja he wo main aapako bataanaa chahta hum
 750 crores means 40,000 packets of Rs 1000 and 80,000 packets of Rs 500
 is tarah 500 or 1000 ke kareeb sava lakh packet hote hai
 To count 125 lakh packets, on an average, 500 to 800 cashiers and similar machines are required
 sahakaari bainkon ke paas itani suvidha hi nahin hoti he
 According to 190 branches the average is 4 crores per branch, which is not possible to be deposited in the cooperative bank
 kya ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank ke paas 500 se 800 kaisier hai? note ginaney kii itani mashine us vakt thim? is bank kaa vistaar teen zilon main hai kya teen zilon main 500 kaisier honge? kuch ajeeb nahin lag rahaa he aapako lekin daawey ke saath kuch bhi nahin kah sakate kyonki ye sab to jaanch ke baad hi pataa chal saktaa he
 By the way, after talking to many cashiers, it was found out that if a note counting machine works continuously, then after three to four hours, it speaks
 yani garam ho jaati he uske baad wo kam ginaney lagati he
 Work has to be stopped and those who maintain the machine have to be called
 yahi nahin jab kaisier kisi se paise letaa he to ek upabhokta se baat bhi karata he, use bataata he
 So all the work cannot be done in one to two minutes
 note ginaney kii mashin ke bare main isliye bataa rahaa hum kyonki 21 june ko bijness standard, iconomik times, manilife dot in, new indian express ne apni website par ek khabar chhaapi

 artiai kii soochna main yah nahin likhaa he ki isamen asamaanya baat kya he, kyon unhen shaq he ki itane paise jamaa hue, magar is bank ke adhyaksh amit shah hai, isliye is jaankaree ko alag tareeke se dekha gaya ki paanch dinon main 745 karod yahaan jamaa hue yani badale gaye
 But the political dimension of this news itself got bigger
 hamaare sahyogi or anya patrakaron ne bhi din bhar artiai kaaryakarta manoranjan raay se sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He did not meet nor talk while he was in Delhi
 ve kyon chup ho gaye or kyon baat nahin kii, vahi behatar bataa sakate hai
 He later switched off the phone but said that this is not the case as the media is showing
 idhar scrol dot in ne likhaa he ki kai website ne jo pehle ye khabar chhaapi thi unhone hataa lee
 The details of why these news websites removed this news are not mentioned in the scroll report
 yah khabar sabase pehle indo asian news sarvice ke hawaale se prakashit hui thi
 Public's reporter and Moneylife have printed this story and not removed it
 bijness standard, vir, quint or neshnal harald main bhi yah khabar chhapi he
 News has appeared in some places but Amit Shah's name is not there
 is arth main ki ve is bank ke chayaraman hai jahaan notebandi ke dauraan deshbhar main sabase adhik puraane note jamaa hue yaa badale gaye
 The RTI quoted in the news did not mention what went wrong, but two things that made this news big is that the oldest notes in the whole country were replaced here and the other is its chairman BJP National President Amit Shah
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne is par chutki lete hue twit kar diya ki "ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank ke nideshak amit shah ji ko badhai
 Your bank has received the first prize for converting an old note into a new one
 5 dinon main 750 karod
 Demonetisation has ruined the lives of millions of Indians
 aapaki uplabdhi ko salaam
 '' hamane bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa twitor handle dekha magar vahaan is khabar se judi kisi kism kii pratikriya nahin thi jabaki aam taur par bijepi ke netaa rahul gandhi ke kisi bhi aarope yaa chutki par jawaab dena nahin bhoolatey hai
 The Twitter handle of BJP spokespersons was also not attacked by Rahul's statement in which his national president was targeted
 vaise kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne aaj baqayda press conference bhi kii, ab ham daawey ke saath nahin kah sakate ki vahaan unase is bare main koi sawaal poocha gaya yaa nahin magar jitna ham dekh paae usamen unase ye sawaal nahin kiya gaya tha
 Have political journalists decided on their own that this is not news or that someone has lost their mind
 kai baar aisa bhi hota he
 However, Ravi Shankar Prasad made it clear that his press conference is only on the statements of Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Saifuddin Soz on Kashmir
 phir bhi koi sawaal to kar hi saktaa tha
 But did not
 nahin bolne se or nahin poochne se maamla or sandehaaspad ho jaataa he
 It was better that it should have been denied by speaking
 congress ne is par baqayda press conference bhi kii
 Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala came and said that we have been present on a very important subject
 acha hota ki artiai kaaryakarta manoranjan raay apni baat kehete, bijepi apni baat rakhti to baat aage badhati or baat samaj main bhi aati, magar koparative bank main sabase adhik paisa notebandi ke dauraan jamaa hua isamen chup rahane vaali baat kya he
 Amit Shah is not the Chairman of Ahmedabad Cooperative Bank since today, he is since 2000
 vaise bharat sarkaar ne kai baar kaha he ki notebandi ke dauraan kai khaaton kii jaanch ho rahi he jinamein aswabhaavik rup se ratorat karodon jamaa ho gaye
 The Minister of the Government has said this very strongly, then the same thing could be said about the Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank that the investigation will be done in which accounts and how much money has been deposited
 randeep surajevaala ne sirf do bainkon ke bare main nahin balki amarelli ke zila sahakaarita bank ke bare main bhi aarope lagaaya he ki vahaan 205 karod jamaa hue or iske chayaraman bijepi ke purv saansad hai
 100 crores were also deposited in the Cooperative Bank of Bharuch, which is headed by BJP MLA
 maharashtra ke uttar mumbai se bijepi saansad gopal shetty ne kaha he ki congress ke paas kaam nahin he isliye puraane mudde uthaati rahati he
 The comments udhar naabard ne kaha he ki donon zila sahakaarita bainkon main koi gadabadi nahin hui he
 On behalf of this, Entertainment Rai was informed about RTI
 bijness standard ne pitiai ke hawaale se khabar chhaapi he
 NABARD has stated that the average deposit per account holder in Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank is Rs 46,795
 jo ki gujarat ke 18 koaparative bainkon ke ausat se kam he
 During demonetisation, one lakh 60 thousand consumers deposited 746 crores in the bank, which is only 15 percent of the total deposits
 naabard ne yah bhi kaha ki ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank main desh kii sheersh koparative sanstha he jise haal hi main shreshth pradarshan kaa puraskaar mila he
 So what happened today is in front of you
 750 karod kaa matlab he 1000 rupee ke 40,000 packet or 500 rupee ke 80,000 packet
 In this way, there are about 125 lakh packets of 500 and 1000
 sava lakh packet ginaney ke liye ausatan 500 se 800 kaisier or itani hi mashine chahie
 Co-operative banks do not have this much facility
 190 branch ke hisaab se ausat 4 karod prati branch hota he jo sahakaari bank main jamaa mumkin nahin he
 Does Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank have 500 to 800 cashiers? How many note counting machines were there at that time? This bank is expanded in three districts
 Will there be 500 cashiers in three districts? You are not feeling anything strange but you cannot say anything with the claim because all this can be revealed only after investigation
 vaise kai kaitiyaron se baat karne par pataa laga ki ek note ginaney kii mashin lagaataar bhi kaam kare to teen se chaar ghante ke baad ten bol detii he
 That means it gets hot after that it starts counting less
 kaam rokna hota he or mashin ke mentanence waalon ko bulaanaa padataa he
 Not only this, when the cashier takes money from someone, he also talks to a consumer, tells him
 isliye sara kaam ek se do minute main nahin ho saktaa he
 i am talking about the note counting machine because on 21 June, Business Standard, Economic Times, Moneylife

 ahmedabad zila sahakaarita bank kii website par likhaa he ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah hi iske adhyaksh hai
 He has been the President since 2000
 isi ke saath rajkot ke zila sahakaarita bank main bhi 693 karod rupee jamaa hue hai
 It is headed by Vitthalbhai Radadia, a cabinet minister in the Gujarat government
 artiai kaaryakarta ke hawaale se chhapi khabaron main kaha gaya he ki manoranjan raay ko yah jaankaree naabard kii taraf se di gai he
 The RTI notice does not say what is unusual about it, why they doubt that so much money has been accumulated, but the president of this bank is Amit Shah, so this information was seen differently that in five days 745 crores here Accumulated means changed
 lekin is khabar kaa raajnneetik aayam apane aap bada ho gaya
 Our colleagues and other journalists also attempted to contact RTI activist Manoranjan Rai throughout the day
 unhone mulaakaat nahin kii or na baat kii jabaki ve dilli main hi the
 Why they got quiet and why they didn't talk, they can tell better

 Although Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also held a press conference today, now we can not say with any claim whether there was any question asked about it or not, but as much as we could see it was not asked in this question
 kya raajnneetik patrakaron ne khud se tay kar liya ki ye koi khabar nahin he yaa phir unke zahan main kisi kaa khyaal aa gaya
 This happens many times
 vaise ravishankar prasad ne saaf-saaf kah diya ki unki press conference kashmir par die gaye sirf congress netaa gulam nabi azaad or safuddin soz ke bayaan par he

 It would have been nice if RTI activist Manoranjan Rai would have said his words, if the BJP had kept its word, then the matter would have gone ahead and the matter would have been understood, but what is the silent thing in the co-operative bank that most of the money was deposited during demonetisation
 amit shah ahmedabad koaparative bank ke adhyaksh aaj se nahin hai, 2000 ke saal se hai
 However, the Government of India has said many times that many accounts are being investigated during demonetisation, in which unnaturally crores were deposited overnight
 sarkaar ke mantri ne khub zorshor se ye baat kahi he, to phir yahi baat ahmatbaad zila koaparative bank ke bare main bhi kahi ja sakati thi ki jaanch hogi ki kin-kin khaaton main kitna or kiskaa paisa jamaa hua he
 Randeep Surjewala has alleged not only about two banks but also about Amreli's District Cooperative Bank that deposited 205 crores and its chairman is a former BJP MP

 BJP MP from Maharashtra's North Mumbai Gopal Shetty has said that the Congress does not have work, so it keeps raising old issues

 faruk abdulla piem modi se adhik rashtravaadi hai
 It is a pity that Farooq Abdullah's custody has been extended by another 3 months
 He is more of a nationalist than most, certainly more than the PM of India who is out to destroy our country
 MODI stands for Man who Destroyed India

 congress ke varisht netaa shashi tharur (shashi Tharoor) ne kaha ki party kii jimmedaari he ki vah dharmanirpekshata kii raksha kare
 He also said that the solution to the party's crisis in the Hindi belt is not in the 'majority appeasement' or on the lines of 'coke light', in offering any kind of 'light Hindutva' and walking on this path will lead to 'congress zero'
 
 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa or uske sahyogiyon dwaara hindu hone kaa daawa 'british footbal ke badmaash samarthakon' kii apni team ke prati vafadari se alag nahin he
 In an interview to 'pti-bhasha' before the release of his book 'the Hindu Way: An Introduction to Hinduism', Tharoor claimed that the propaganda being done by the ruling people is not truely Hindutva but One is to 'distort' the great vote, which he has turned into a narrow political weapon for purely political and electoral gains
 tharur ne kaha ki ek satark ashaavadi ke rup main vah kahana chahenge ki badi sankhya main aise bhartiya hai, jo haal ke 'roodhiwaadee rujhaan' kaa virodh karne ke liye patibaddh hai or ve lagaataar yah sunishchit karenge ki 'bharat ko lekar vikrut vichaar' safal na ho
 The Thiruvananthapuram MP said, 'as a member of the Congress Party, i believe that the party has a fundamental role in defending secularism in India, and it is its duty to lead it
 ' unhone kaha, 'jo log yah suzav de rahe hai ki hindi pattee main party ke sankat kaa samaadhaan bhaajapa kii tarah 'bahusankhyak tushtikaran' main he, ve ek badi galati kar rahe hai
 If the voter has the choice of choosing one between the real thing and his copy, he will choose the real one every time
 'tharur ne kaha ki bhaajapa kii safalataa se bhaybheet hone ke bajaay congress ke liye behatar hoga ki vah un siddhanton ke liye khadi ho, jin par usne hameshaa vishwaas kiya he or desh ko unke anusaran ke liye prerit kare
 The 63-year-old Congress leader said, "faithful people will respect a party that shows the courage of our beliefs, not offering some kind of 'light Hindutva' on the lines of 'coke Light' and 'pepsi Zero'
" 'lite hindutv' kaa ant sirf 'jiro congress' ke rup main hoga
 In the recent Lok Sabha elections, the Congress party was wiped out of the entire Hindi belt
 iske baad party ke bheetar or baahar kuch logon ne yah suzav diya ki congress ko 'alpsankhyak tushtikaran' ko lekar bhaajapa kii kahani kaa jawaab dene or apni dharmanirpeksh pahchaan par naram rukh apnaane kii jarurat he
 'coke Lite' and 'pepsi Zero' are sugar-free and calorie-free versions of the original soft drink brand
 tharur ne kaha, 'hindutv kii khubsuurati yah he ki hamaare yahaan kanoon banane ke liye koi pope nahin he, koi imam fatwa jari kar yah nahin bataata he ki sachcha mat kya he, koi akelaa pavitra granth nahin he
 There is no such thing in Hinduism

 rajdhani dilli se sate punjab, haryana, rajasthan or uttar pradesh main kharif kii kataai kar rahe kisaanon ne agali fasal kii taiyaari ke liye ek baar phirparaali(fasal kii khoont) jalaana shuru kar diya he
 This rising smoke will make it difficult for people in the national capital Delhi and surrounding areas to breathe in the next few days
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya sarkaar is baar bhi pichley saal kii tarah dekhati rahegi or dilli ke upar dhuen kii chadar chaane ke baad hawa main hathpair maaregi?yaad kiijie pichley saal 2017 kii deepawali, jab rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main supreme court kii pahal ke baad kendra sarkaar ne pataakhon ke istemaal par pratibandh laga diya tha
 During this ban, it was claimed that Deepawali firecrackers pollute the atmosphere of the national capital badly and it has to bear the crores of population of the national capital including these neighboring states
 2017 main pratibandh ke saae main pataakhe nahin phode gaye lekin iske baavjood rashtriya rajdhani or aasapaas ke rajyon ko pradooshan ke prakope se nahin bachaaya ja sakaa
 Firecrackers were banned so that it could be known how much pollution is being received by firecrackers in the atmosphere
 survey main hairaan karne vaale tathy saamne aae ki uttar bharat ke pradooshan kaa asli villen pataakhe nahin balki punjab, haryana, rajasthan or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke kheton main jalaai jane vaali paraali he
 What is the effect of burning stubble? According to data from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), a decade ago, the atmosphere of the country's capital Delhi burns about 150 million tons of carbon dioxide, 9 million tons of carbon monoxide and 0
 25 million ton behad jahrili oxide of sulfur se bhar jaati he
 The IARI claims that Delhi has about 17 times more pollution than other sources of pollution such as burning of carts, factories and garbage in northern India during october-november
 paraali jalaane se corban dioxide kaa sanchaar anya pradooshan sroton se lagbhag 64 guna adhik hota he
 What is the stubble crisis for farmers? The tradition of burning stubble is not new in India
 agriculture research institute dwaara 2014 main ekatra kiye gaye aankadon ke mutabik 2008-09 ke dauraan desh main fasal kii kataai ke baad lagbhag 620 million ton paraali kheton main bachi
 Of this, about 16 percent of the starch was burnt in the fields, in which about 60 percent of the starch was of paddy and only 22 percent of the starch was wheat
 krishi vibhaag ke anumaan ke mutabik akelepunjabamein 20 million ton dhan or 20 million ton gehun kii paraali kheton main batch rahi he
 It is worth noting that the burning of straw is usually done by the farmers after the kharif crop, because the straw and fodder for the animals is prepared from the straw that comes out in the Rabi crop
 yah kisaanon ke liye atirikt aay kaa saadhan banataa he
 At the same time, after the preparation of the Kharif crop, farmers in North India have only 15 to 20 days for the next sowing
 jahaan ek taraf is samay main use tyohaar bhi manaanaa he, use agali buaai ke liye khet ko taiyaar bhi karnaa he
 In such a situation, agricultural experts claim that about 80 per cent of the farmers in these states burn the stubble in their fields
 2015 main dow naresh trehaan ne diya tha ye photo!kuch samay pehle desh ke jane-maane heart sarjan dow naresh trehan ne india today ko bataaya tha ki dilli ensiaar main hone vaala polution aadmi ke fefdon par bura asar daal rahaa he
 To establish this, Dr
 Trehan compared the lungs of a man in New Delhi to the lungs of another man living in Himachal Pradesh
 dow trehan ke mutabik dilli main jari pradooshan se aadmi ke fefdon par bura asar pad rahaa he or vah asthma samet kai gambhir bimariyon kaa janak ban rahaa he
 Confusion why Modi government? In 2017, NITI Aayog suggested to the central government to spend $ 600 million (rs 3,200 crore) to curb this cause of pollution
 is suzav ke baad kendra sarkaar ne prati varsh 230 million dollar (1,700 karod rupee) kharch kar kisaanon ko paraali jalaane se rokane kaa prastaav taiyaar kiya
 Under the Central Government's proposal, it will help farmers in three states adjoining Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to purchase such machines to prevent farmers from burning stubble
 in mashiinon ke jariye kisaan aasaani se kheton main pade paraali ko ekatra kar khaad banane kaa kaam kar sakate hai
 But on this plan prepared last year, the government is in a dilemma and once again the process of burning stubble has started in these states and the scheme of the government is locked in the files
 3200 karod rupee banaam jehar?is yojana ke mutabik kendra sarkaar do saal main 3,200 karod rupee kharch kar paraali kii samasya par puri tarah se kaabo paa sakati hai
 It is important to note that burning of straw in the fields is illegal and for the last several years the state governments have been trying to give effect to this law
 iske baavjood paraali sankat se saal dar saal rajdhani dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main pradooshan kaa str kharaab ho rahaa he
 On one hand, research done by Dr
 Naresh Trehan is showing serious impact of this problem on people living in the National Capital Region
 vahiin kendra sarkaar paise kharch kar is samasya ko hameshaa ke liye kaabo karne ke maamle main asamanjas main dikh rahi he
 Another report before the central government claims that the farmers of Punjab are losing Rs 800 to 2000 crores of nutritional loss annually and Rs 500 to 1,500 crores by spending on nitrogen, phosphorus and potash fertilizer every year
 gauratlab he ki is samasya ke prabhaav kshetra main yadi rajyon kii jansankhya ko dekhen to uttar pradesh (20 karod), rajasthan (6
 8 crores), Delhi NCR (5 crores), Punjab (2
 8 karod) or haryana (2
 5 crores) has a total population of about 37 crores
 is jansankhya kii aadhi jansankhya paraali se ho rahe pradooshan se sidhe prabhavit hoti he
 That is, the government has to spend about Rs 3,200 crore to save the country's 15-16 crore population from toxic air
 prati vyakti ye kharch takreeban 200 rupee prativarsh baithta he
 Is this price so high that the government cannot pay it to save the common man from poisonous smoke? This question is getting darker like poisonous clouds in the sky of delhi-ncr

 Mehul Choksi, a co-accused in the 13,000-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam, has claimed that the Government of India has no evidence against him, but his 12,000-thousand-crore business was ruined
 mehul chokasee kii ore se uske vakil ne yah bayaan jari kiya he
 Mehul Choksi has said that he was in the US where he underwent surgery when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a case against him
 isi dauraan awaas or daftar par jaanch agenciyon ne chhapemari kii thi
 Mehul Choksi had earlier said in a recent statement that his business was targeted and destroyed
 mehul chokasee ke vakil ne kaha, '25 varshon kii mehnat se 12,000 karod kaa kaarobaar khadaa kiya gaya tha jise barabaad kar diya gaya
 Brands like Nakshatra, Ginni, Asami and Gitanjali had captured the hearts of people
 jewelery kaarobaar main mehul chokasee ne apana naam sthapit kar liya tha
 By targeting this brand, Punjab National Bank blamed our brand for protecting itself and diverting the attention of people
 'chokasee ke vakil kii ore se jari bayaan main yah kaha gaya, 'chokasee kii surgery hui thi
 He was struggling with a cardiac operation when several investigating agencies of India unexpectedly started raiding him against him
 'chokasee ke vakil ne kaha, 'jaanch agenciyon ne mehul chokasee dwaara 1995 main bank main jamaa kiye gaye dastavej ke aadhaar par chhapemari kii
 Choksi had submitted these documents along with the 'no Your Customer' application

 Choksi was not a partner of any firm when the investigating agencies started taking action
 chokasee ne san 2000 main hi is tarah ke sabhi ferms chhod di thim
 Choksi claims that the officials of Punjab National Bank told him that the matter could be resolved by mutual agreement
 mehul chokasee ne daawa kiya ki pienbi ke adhikari kagajaat sahi karne ke anurodh ko baar-baar taalte gaye
 The bank has accused the old KYC of making it base
 mehul chokasee ke vakil kii ore se jari bayaan main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki pienbi ke adhikariyon ne khud ko bachaane ke liye aise aarope lagaae hai
 It is the fault of PNB that they did not update the relevant documents in their central system in time, nor did it inform the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
 mehul chokasee kii ore se yah bhi daawa kiya gaya ki na keval chokasee ne pienbi ko kevaisi ko apadet karne ke liye likhaa balki neshnal stock exange or bombai stock exange ko bhi 7 farvari 2018 ko is bare main suchit kiya
 Mehul Choksi also claimed that an attempt was made to meet the CBI as well
 lekin har prayaas asafal hue
 Choksi's lawyer claimed, 'our bank statements testify to this

 Everyone is familiar with leopard terror in Uttarakhand
 abhi haal hi main dehradun jile ke raywala kshetra main haryana ke ek yatri ko tendua ne apana shikaar banaaya tha
 In this way, leopard has killed 16 people in Raiwala in the last four years
 magar dehradun main ek aisa vakya saamne aayaa he jisane insaan auratenduake bich dosti kii ek nai misaal pesh kii he
 Tired and injured, the thirsty leopard had reached the residential area in search of water
 lekin insaani prem ke chalate tendua ne kisi par hamalaa nahin kiya
 a person gave him water and bathed the leopard in the house with a bucket of water in the heat
 jab tendue kii pyaas bujh gai to phir graminon ne van vibhaag ko isaki soochna di
 Later, when the entire team of forest department reached there, they were stunned to see that a dreaded leopard was sitting among the people comfortably
 haalanki van vibhaag use pakadaney ke liye puri taiyaari ke saath aayaa hua tha
 After a while the forest department personnel brought the leopard to the nearby Malsi Deer Park where it was treated and released into the forest
 haalanki gambhir rup se jakhmi hone kii vajaj se baad main tendue kii maut ho gai
 One thing is clear from this whole incident that love is still heavy on everyone, whether it is the dreaded, the injured, the hungry thirsty leopard or the human being, the only difference is that we humans blame wild animals, but forget that We are forcibly entering their territory

 The controversy over the state's first mega food park being built in Khagaria, Bihar, is not taking the name of freeze
 29 november ko kendriya khaadya prasanskaran mantri harsimrat cor is mega food park kaa udghaatan karne ke liye khagadiya pahunchi
 Before the inauguration, he inspected the food court, and found that its construction has not been completed
 aanan-fanan main harsimrat cor ne is food park kaa udghaatan karne se manaa kar diya or waapas dilli laut gayi 
 Now the promoters of Pristine Group, the company that created this mega food park, have come up for the entire controversy and have made serious allegations against the Union Minister
 pristin group ke diarector sanjay mawaar ne aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main kaha he ki unhen is baat kii jaankaree thi ki food park ke nirmaan kaa kaary 70 se 80 fisadi puraa hua he or takreeban 20 fisadi kaam or bachaa hua he
 Significantly, Pristine Group is an infrastructure developer company
 29 november ko jab harsimrat cor food park kaa muyna kar rahi thi to unhone ek bhi production unit ko kaam karte hue nahin paaya or isi baat par vah naaraaz ho gai
 Sanjay Mawar told that because his group's work only used to create infrastructure, it would take 1 month more time to complete and not to produce
 sanjay mawaar ne kaha ki is mega food park kaa kaam kyonki 20 fisadi or bachaa hua tha isi vajah se is haalat main nahin tha ki iskaa udghaatan kiya jaae
 Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Khagadia did not come and made all efforts to ensure that the inauguration of this food park be carried forward for a month, but he did not listen to anything
 nirmaan kaa kaary takreeban 20 fisadi or bachaa huasanjay mawaar ne kaha he ki khagadiya ke jiladhikari aniruddh kumaar ne is mega food park kaa nirikshan kiya tha or paaya tha ki iske nirmaan kaa kaary takreeban 20 fisadi or bachaa hua he or isi ko lekar unhone 12 november ko bihar sarkaar ko patr bhi likhaa tha or aagrah kiya tha ki food park kii haalat abhi aisi nahin he ki iskaa udghaatan mukhyamantri nitish kumaar karen or isi ko lekar unhone pristin group ko nirmaan kaary puraa karne ke liye 1 maheene kaa vakt or dene kii sifarish kii thi
 Sanjay Mawar said that the Khagadia District Magistrate's report was also ignored by the Union Food Processing Ministry and pressured to inaugurate the food park on 29 November itself
 sanjay mawaar ne khulaasa kiya or kaha ki pichley takreeban 2 maheene se lagaataar kendriya khaadya prasanskaran mantralay ke adhikariyon ko taraf se unhen phone aa rahaa he or un par dabaav banaaya ja rahaa tha ki food park kaa nirmaan jald puraa karen taaki mantri harsimrat cor jinhone is food park kaa shilanyas agast 2015 main kiya tha, vahiin iskaa udghaatan bhi loksabhaa chunaav main aachaar samhita lagu hone se pehle karen
 It is worth mentioning that this food park center, built at a cost of 127 crores, is a joint venture between the Princeton Group which has an investment of about 50 crores centers and the rest of the Princeton Group

 The CBI has appealed to the court in this case to sentence Kuldeep Singh Sengar to life imprisonment

 He also mentally tortured the victim's family
 aise maamalon main court kii duty banatihai ki vah aise aaropee ko sakht se sakht sajaa dekar samaaj main udhaaharan pesh kare
 So that nobody further thinks before committing this type of crime with women

 At the same time, during the hearing, Kuldeep Singh Sengar's lawyer has asked the court not to give strict punishment citing Sengar's age

 aaie jaanate hai chhath parv ke liye prachlit kuch khaas geeton ko: Kiran Rijiju has taken a soft stance on the issue of eating beef (beef)
 unhone kaha ki unke bayaan kaa galat matlab nikaala gaya or us vakt vah logon ke is sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the ki kyabif khaane waalon kopakistan chalaa janaa chahie
 In a phone conversation with TV Today, he said, 'india is a secular country and food habit cannot be imposed on the states
 jahaan hindu bahusankhyak he, unki aasthaa or manyataon kaa sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 "I also eat beef, who will stop?" It is noteworthy that Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju has supported beef eating and has also given a befitting reply to his senior BJP leader and Union Minister of State Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi
 alpsankhyak maamalon ke rajyamantri nakvi ne kaha tha ki bif khaane waalon kopakistan chale janaa chahie
 This statement was described by Kiran Rijiju as 'distasteful' and told that he himself eats beef
 rigiju ne kaha, 'mambifakhata hum
 i am from Arunachal Pradesh
 kya koi mujhe roak saktaa he? hamen kisi ke rojaanaa ke kaamon se aahat nahin hona chahie
 He said this in Aizawl on Tuesday
 unhone kaha, 'yah ek loktantric desh he
 But many times statements are made which are not interesting
 'angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' kii khabar ke mutabik, unhone kaha, 'agar koi mizo isai kahata he ki yah jisas kii dharti he to punjab or haryana main kisi ko dikkat kyon hoti he? hamen har jagah ke logon kii bhaawanaaon kaa aadar karnaa hoga
 He said that Maharashtra is a Hindu majority state, Gujarat is also, Madhya Pradesh is also, if they make laws which are beneficial for Hindu society, then they should be allowed to do so
 lekin hamaari jagah par jahaan ham bahusankhyak hai, hamaari manyataon ke liye hitkaari kanoon hi banane chahie
 He said, 'we have no problem with their way of life, they should not be in our way
 agar koi aisa bayaan detaa he jo aapaki manyataon par thopa hua-sa lage to yah acha nahin he
 ' naagarikta bill ke khilaaf muslim sanghathananaagarikta bill ko bataaya samvidhan ke khilaafngarikta sanshodhan bill sansad ke donon sadanon se paas ho gaya he or raashtrapati se manjuuri ke saath hi ise kanoonee manyata mil jaaegi
 After this, non-muslim refugees who came to India from Pakistan, Bengal and Afghanistan will get citizenship of the country
 ise lekar desh ke muslim sanghathan sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 The tone of protest has been intensified by calling the Bill against the basic structure of the Constitution
 unhen lagata he ki is vidheyak ke jariye musalamaanon ko aane vaale samay main enarasi prakriya ke kaaran dikkatein khadi ho sakati hai
 Maulana Arshad Madni said that this legislation violates Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution
 is bill kaa puraa masauda dharmik bhedbhaav or purvaagrah ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya gaya he or isamen kaha gaya he ki utpeedit alpsankhyak afghanistan, pakistan or bangladesh se bharat aaenge to unhen keval sharan nahin balki naagarikta bhi pradaan kii jaaegi, jabaki muslim nagarikon ko isse alag rakhaa gaya he
 It is clear that through this bill, an attempt has been made to draw a line between the citizens of the country on religious grounds
 bill paas hona moulik adhikaron kaa hanan- madaniunhone kaha ki yah tark bilkul galat he ki naagarikta vidheyak kaa enarasi se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 This bill has been introduced to make the NRC process difficult for Muslims
 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak nagarikon ke moulik adhikaron ko bhi hanan karata he
 He said that the implications of the bill remain to be seen, but when the NRC comes into force throughout the country, it will be a curse for millions of Muslims who cannot prove their citizenship for some reason
 madani ne kaha ki yah bill khatarnaak he kyonki yah desh main sadiyon se chali aa rahidharmik or saanskrithik ekta ke liye ek gambhirakhatara paidaa kar saktaa he
 Will oppose the bill in a democratic way- Syed Saadatullah Hussaini, president of hussainizmat-e-islami, said that we condemn the citizenship bill
 yah bill sampradayik soch or pakshpaat purna tareeke se laayaa gaya he
 In this, there is a provision to give citizenship to the rest of the community except Muslim, which is against unity in the diversity of the country and the forgotten spirit of the Constitution
 itnaa hi nahin majahab ke aadhaar par baantnaa samvidhan hi nahin balki maanavtaa ke mulyon ke bhi khilaaf he
 That is why we are opposing this citizenship bill
 jamiyat ulema e hind ke mahasachiv niaj faruki ne kaha ki naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak bhartiya samvidhan kii aatma ke khilaaf he
 We do not see this by associating with Muslims or any religion, but looking at it from the perspective of the Constitution
 hindu mahasabha or muslim lig donon ke khilaaf jamiyat ulema e hind tha or bharat ke secular mizaaj ke saath khadey the
 Today the same foundation of the Constitution has been attacked through this bill
 ise lekar ham janata ke bich jaaenge or loktantric tareeke se virodh karenge

 He said that there is no point in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demand for an answer in the discussion, as he has done so on five occasions in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
 vah kathor sachaai saamne laate hai, isliye vipakshi charchaa se dare hue hai
 He said that the Congress had demanded discussion in the Lalit Modi case, but when the government was ready for it immediately, they demanded that there should be resignation first, only then they would participate in any discussion
 unhone kaha ki congress ne lalit modi maamle main charchaa kii maang kii thi, lekin jab sarkaar iske liye fouran taiyaar ho gai to unhone maang kii ki pehle istife hone chahie, tabhi kisi charchaa main bhaag lenge

 The SCO Summit is going to be very important this time

 Till now India was associated with SCO as an observer
 aisa pehali baar hoga jab kisi paryvekshak desh ko essio kii purna sadsyta di jaaegi
 However, Pakistan along with India will also be included in the SCO
 essio main bharat ko sadsyta milanaa ek badi kamyaabi mana ja rahaa he
 China and Russia, both major countries of the organization, have also welcomed India
 ab sawaal ye he ki is sanghathan main shaamil hone se bharat ko kya phaayde honge yaa bharat ke liye is essio kii sadsyta milane ke kya myne hai
 SCO will prove to be a strong platform in India's fight with terrorism on terrorism
 kyonki is sanghathan kaa mukhya uddeshy madhya asia main suraksha chintaaon ke maddenzar sahyog badhanaa he
 The SCO has its own mechanism for fighting terrorism
 saath hi march main aatankwaad or charampanth se ladane ke liye sabhi sadsy deshon ne prastaav paas kiya tha, jisase essio ke anti teror charter ko majbootee mili
 In such a situation, India can expose terrorist policies of Pakistan on the platform of SCO
 central asia main badhegaa dakhlaissio kii sadsyta ke saath hi bharat kaa central asian deshon main dakhal bad jaayegaa
 These countries are very strong in terms of resources, which can prove beneficial for India
 saath hi vahaan ke bazaaron main bharat kii entry aasaan ho jaayegi
 China can build on OBOR, India may also face some disadvantages if it gets SCO membership amidst the grand advantages
 china-pakistan aarthik galiyare (CPEC) ke masale par china or pakistan ek saath milakar bharat kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 At the same time China can build diplomatic pressure on India to complete the 'one Belt One Road' project
 rus se or majboot honge rishteyun to rus or bharat ke rishte pichley 70 saalon se behatar chale aa rahe hai
 Even on international forums, Russia has been seen standing with India bypassing the world
 aise main essio kii sadsyta milane par sanghathan ke mukhya sadsy rus ke saath bharat kii dosti or gahari ho jaaegi
 India along with Russia can surround China and Pakistan on issues like terrorism and CPEC

 us samay mere paas 'ramlila' jaisi film banane ke liye paryaapt dhan nahin tha
 i later made 'hum Dil De Chuke Sanam', which had a Gujarati background, so the production of 'ramlila' at that time would have seemed repetitive

 ' Union Minister and former Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has blamed former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan for the Adarsh scam
 tippaniyan Deshmukh has alleged in testimony before the Adarsh commission that the revenue department's decision to make 40 per cent non-military people members in Adarsh housing Society was made
 jab unhen is bare main rajasav vibhaag ke saath baithak kii soochna dene vaali chitthee dikhaai gai to unhone kaha ki ye chitthee unhone rajasav mantri ko bhej di thi kyonki yah maamla unke mantralay kaa tha

 kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ne aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main supreme court ke adeshon par kanoonee raay hasil karne ke baad basapa pramukh mayawati ke khilaaf apni jaanch band karne kaa faisla kiya he
 CBI sources said the apex court had quashed the agency's FIR last year in connection with the alleged disproportionate assets against the BSP leader
 lekin ek nijee vyakti dwaara hastkshep arji daayar kiye jane ke baad is maamle main anishchay kii sthiti utpann ho gai thi
 The case against Mulayam has already been closed
 In September, the CBI closed the 8-year-old disproportionate assets case against Mulayam Singh Yadav, the head of the Samajwadi Party
 jaanch agency is maamle main mulaayam singh ke khilaaf saboot nahin juta saki thi jis vajah se cese band karne kaa faisla kiya gaya
 The disproportionate assets case on Mulayam came to light in November 2005 when lawyer and Congress worker Vishwanath Chaturvedi, a resident of Rae Bareli, filed a PIL in the Supreme Court against Mulayam, his sons Akhilesh Yadav and Prateek Yadav and daughter-in-law Dimple Yadav
 The property was sought to be investigated by the CBI
 mayawati ke maamle main sutron ne bataaya ki supreme court ne is saal 8 agast ko hastkshep kii anumati ke liye daayar arji khaarij kar di thi jisase mayawati ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti kaa maamla band karne kaa rasta saaf ho gaya tha
 Sources said that after getting a certified copy of the recent order, the agency sought legal opinion on the orders of the apex court on the issue
 unhone kaha ki kanoon visheshgyon kaa mat tha ki agency ko maamle kii jaanch band kar deni chahie
 Experts believed that if one wanted an investigation, he could go to the appropriate court to obtain the appropriate order which the CBI would follow
 supreme court ne 8 agast ko uttar pradesh ke nivasee kamalesh verma kii yachika khaarij kar di thi jo aay se adhik sampatti kaa prakaran khatm karne ke liye mayawati dwaara daayar kiye gaye maamle main hastkshep karne vaale vyakti the
 While securing his order on May 1, the bench said that the FIR in the disproportionate assets case was quashed as the CBI proceeded against Mayawati without properly understanding her orders which were limited to the Taj Corridor case
 haalanki, isane kaha tha ki faisle se aay se adhik sampatti ke duusare maamle main mayawati ke khilaaf kaarywahi karne kii sibiai kii shakti nahin chhini he

 Something similar happened in Darbhanga district of Bihar
 jahaan ek dabang raatbhar ek adhed ko berahami se pitataa rahaa
 Dabanggai's Alam is that he kept calling the police as well but the Bihar police slept peacefully throughout the night
 nateeja ye hua ki pitayee kii vajah se us shaks kii maut ho gai
 His fault was just that his son had taken heart with a girl from Dabango's house
 hatya kii is khaufnak vaardaat ko anjaam dene vaale aaropee kidabangagaika asar itnaa tha ki usne khud thanedaar ko phone kiya
 Told him that he was beating a person
 jab police nahin ai to aaropee ne darbhanga ke police captain tak ko phone mila diya
 But the oblivious Bihar Police, who gave the slogan of "bihar Police always with you", did not think it appropriate to pick up the phone and the man died due to beating of the bullies
 maamla darbhanga jile ke adama gaanv kaa he
 Raja alias Hrithik, son of Dhirendra Singh of this village, had given his heart to Shikha, granddaughter of Surendra Singh of his village and daughter of Krishna Pratap Singh
 dhire-dhire donon kaa pyaar paravaan chadhane laga
 Both took vows of living and dying together
 parivaar ke virodh kii parvaah na karte hue shikha apane premi raja ke saath ghar se bhaag gai or mandir main agni ko sakshi maanakar saat phere le liye
 Then what happened was Shikha's family filed a case of Shikha's kidnapping against the king's entire family
 darbhanga ke bahadurpur thana main apharan kaa maamla darj hone ke baad police ke dar or dabangon ke khauf se raja ke pita dhirendra singh or parivaar ke anya sadsy apana ghar chhodkar idhar-udhar rahane lage
 But Shikha's family members were united day and night in search of him
 guuruuvaar kii raat hathiyaarband shikha ke dada or pita ne apane gurgon ke saath dhirendra singh ko bandook nonk par uthaa liya or raatbhar uski benrahami se pitayee kii
 Which caused him to die
 mritak ke bhai brajesh kumaar singh kaa kahana he ki surendra singh or uske gharavaalon ne unke bhai ko ghar se uthaakar peetate-peetate maar daalaa
 During this time many calls were made to the police but no one answered nor did the police come
 brajesh kaa kahana tha ki agar police samay par aa jaati to uske bhai kii jaan bachaai ja sakati thi
 Here Shikha came out after this incident
 shikha ne police ko bataaya ki uskaa apharan nahin hua he balki wo apni marzi se ghar chhod kar apane premi ruthik ke saath bhaag gai thi
 He is married to his will
 shikha ne bataaya ki agar vah ghar chhod kar nahin jaati to uske gharavaale hi uski hatya kar dete
 Shikha said that in the murder of her father-in-law Dhirendra Singh, her grandfather Surendra Singh and father Krishna Pratap Singh should also get a stringent punishment so that no other person of society can commit such shameful and frightening act in the coming time

 ram mandir nirmaan mudde par charchaa ke bich rashtriya janata dal pramukh lalu prasad yadav ke bade bete or purv mantri tej pratap yadav ne bada bayaan diya he
 Tej Pratap Yadav has claimed to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya by taking a brick from Bihar
 tej pratap shuukravaar ko nalanda sthit magadaa main yojit dangal pratiyogita kaa uddhatan karne pahunche the
 Where he launched the program by playing the flute
 iske baad jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki agali baar bihar main argedy kii sarkaar bani to sabhi dharmon ke saath milakar bihar se ek-ek eent upi le jaaenge or vahaan ram mandir banaaenge
 a large number of people had reached there to witness this riot competition
 jinke bich manch se tej pratap ne kaha kibhartiya janata partidesh main ram mandir banane ke naam par logon ke vot lene kaa kaam karti he or ram mandir banane ke samay peeche bhaag jaati he
 He said, 'BGP and RSS who do politics in the name of Ram temple, will end it
 jiske baad baad ve log haathon main chammach lekar thali bajaaenge
 'tej Pratap said that after his party comes to power in Bihar, he will take a brick from Bihar and build a Ram temple
 tabhi bihar or desh se bijepi-aresas kaa khaatmaa hoga
 However, when media reports showed Tej Pratap's statement as a U-turn, he gave a clarification on Twitter
 unhone ek twit main likhaa, 'hamane biharsharif dangal kaarykram main ye kaha ki bhaajapa vaale ram mandir banane kii baat karte hai par taarikh nahin bataayenge
 We will make such a temple where Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians will all go to worship and build a temple of humanity, then the BJP temple issue will end
 'ab tak ram mandir nirmaan ke bare main saarvajanik manch se rajd ke kisi bade yaa chote netaa ne aisa vyaan nahin diya tha
 But this statement of Tej Pratap has given a new twist to the debate
 mahagathbandhan se naata tod nitish kumaar ab bijepi sang haath milakar bihar ke singhaasana par kabiz hai
 Nitish's joining hands with the BJP, Sharad Yadav has gone through a rampage, due to which he has landed on the road of the state and has triggered a revolt
 aise main nitish ne bhi do tut kah diya ki sharad apana faisla lene ke liye aaazaad hai
 It is clear that Nitish and Sharad's political friendship is going to be in full stop
 sharad apni aage kii siyaasi jindagi jorge kii tarah nahin jeena chaahate, yahi vajah he vah bihar kii sadakon par utar kar soobe kaa siyaasi nawz ko tatol rahe hai, jisase vah bhavishya kii raajnneeti kii dasha or disha tay kar saken
 Sharad Yadav, who revolted against the political leader, has gone out on the streets of Bihar to search his political land
 sharad yadav kaa aadhaar hameshaa se obisi or alpsankhyak matadaata rahaa he
 Nitish's joining hands with the BJP has increased resentment, especially among the minority community
 itnaa hi nahin lalu ke saath chhodane se yadav samaaj main bhi kahin na kahin ye kasak he
 Sharad's politics has always been around social justice
 mandal kii siforeeshon ko lagu karaane main bhi ahm bhoomika adaa kii he
 In such a situation, they have an eye on the OBC voters
 nayaa siyaasi formula banane kii jugat main sharadsharad yadav bihar ke siyaasi safar ke jariye jahaan apane logon kaa rukh naapane ke saath-saath nae siyaasi formula banane par bhi kaam kar rahe hai
 If sources are to be believed, Sharad Yadav has three political formulas - JP Model, Kanshiram Model and VP Singh Model
 inhen teenon ko milakar sharad ek nayaa model banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In fact, no political party is working on the issue of Dalits, obcs and minorities nor raising any voice in their favor
 aise main sharad is khaali jagah ko bharne kii koshish karenge
 Sharad Yadav's voice echoed from the street to the Parliament
 Sharad Yadav's voice echoed from the street to the Parliament
 sharad un chuninda netaaon main ek hai, jo sansad main jab bhi bolne ke liye khadey hote he, to sabhi unhen bade dhyaan se sunate hai
 Where the reservation was made in favor, then there has been a loud voice against privatization
 yahi vajah rahi ki sharad hameshaa rashtriya raajnneeti ke poster bvoy banakar sajte rahe hai
 Among the sitting mps, Sharad is among the senior leaders who make their point under the ideology
 lohia ke vichaar or jepi kaa rahaa saathdrasal sharad yadav ne siyasat kii pehali seedhi kahi jane vaali chaatr raajnneeti se shuru kar rashtriya raajnneeti main apana mukaam banaaya he
 Sharad Yadav was born on 1 July 1947 in a farmer family of a village in Hoshangabad district in Madhya Pradesh
 lohia ke vichaaron se prerit hokar chaatr raajnneeti main jude or jepi ke pehle sipaahi bane
 Increased participation in the JP movement
 yuva netaa ke taur par kai andolanon main hissaa liya or MISA (maintenance of Internal Security Act) ke tahat 1969-70, 1972 or 1975 main hiraasat main liye gaye
 In 1974, the first person JP gave a ticket to contest the Lok Sabha elections was Sharad Yadav
 pehali baar 1974 main madhya pradesh kii jabalpur loksabhaa seat se saansad chune gaye
 It was the time of the JP movement and he was the first candidate elected by JP as Haladhar Kisan
 iske baad se lagaataar vah saansad banate rahe hai or abhi bataur saansad yah unka aathvaan kaarykaal chal rahaa he
 Sharad Yadav is such a leader, who won the Lok Sabha elections from three different states Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and reached Parliament
 saamaajik nyaay kaa masihashrad yadav saamaajik nyaay kii ladaai ko hameshaa ladate rahe hai
 From the parliament to the street, he struggled
 mandal ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karaane main sharad yadav kaa bada yogadan rahaa he
 Sharad implemented Mandal's recommendations through the then Prime Minister VP Singh
 itnaa hi nahin sharad yadav sadak se sansad tak hameshaa dalit, obisi or alpsankhyakon ke haq kii ladaai ladate rahe hai
 In such a situation, to say that Sharad's political ground is weak, would be wrong
 sharad ke sahare apni jugat main lalusharad yadav ke sahare lalu bhi apni siyaasi jameen ko majboot karnaa chaahate hai
 Sharad may have landed on the streets of Bihar to gauge his political power, but Lalu's party will get direct benefits of this
 isiilie sharad jab bihar pahunche to unki agavaani karne ke liye badi sankhya menargedineta va kaaryakarta airport pahunche the
 Not only this, Lalu also spoke to Sharad to adopt a rebellious attitude against Nitish
 darasal bihar main sharad or lalu donon kaa hi vot aadhaar ek hi he
 That is why Lalu has laid eyes for him
 sharad ke abhiyaan ke jariye khaskar yadav or muslim phir ekajute ho saktaa he or lalu kii usee par najar he
 In fact, with this vote bank, Lalu has been occupying the throne of power for a long time
 tamilnadu main satta ke liye ladaai jari he

 The second option is to swear Sasikala as CM and ask her to prove her majority while the third option is to impose President's rule in the state

 Most of the witnesses are not relevant and have nothing to do with the case
 ‚Äôbaharhaal adaalat ne kal ke liye faisla surakshit rakh liya
 Sources said that soon after the girl's statement was recorded in December, SDM Usha Chaturvedi claimed that three senior police officers had refused to make a video recording of the victim's statement

 But bjp's happiness is not without any merit, BSP MLA Rambai, who is supporting the government, on Friday accused the Congress of framing his family in a case and said that if his family cannot get justice, then who will get justice in the state will get
 rambai ne shoonyakaal ke dauraan kaha ki damoh jile main ek parivaar ke saath hui ek ghatana main unke parivaar ko fansaa diya gaya he
 He said that he was involved in the government, but his family was not getting justice and 28 people of his family were jailed
 isi dauraan unhone aarope lagaaya ki agar unke parivaar ko nyaay nahin mila to rajya main or kise nyaay milegaa
 Rambai also requested Assembly Speaker NP Prajapati for a CBI inquiry into the matter
 basapa vidhayak sanju singh kushavaah ne rambai kaa samarthan kiya
 However, the Speaker of the Assembly refused to allow the issue to be discussed in the House, as the matter is already in court
 vidhansabha main bajet par charchaa ke dauraan netaa pratipaksh ne kataaksh kiya ki camel nath sarkaar 1 / 3 ke guard ke saath chal rahi he
 In response, Kamal Nath too agreed to this, but said that he has entrusted the responsibility of the ministers to listen to the MLA and take their suggestions
 kamalnath ne bhi sarkaar par khatare se inkaar karte hue kaha, ‚Äúaap goa or karnataka kii tulana madhya pradesh sekhyonki vahaan kii chijen se bilkul alag hai

 Director Zoya Akhtar, known for making out-of-the-box films, has brought the story of the struggle of street rappers to the film screen this time
 film ke jariye ranvir singh ne apana sapana jiya he
 As a rapper, he has shown his talent to the world
 magar rap culture par focus karti gali boy 'hard' nahin ban pai he
 Ranveer's 'time' has already come in the acting zone
 lekin rap world main jarur unka 'time aa gaya' he
 Let's know how this film is made
 kahanigali boy mumbai ke dharavi main rahane vaale muraad (ranvir singh) kii kahani he
 One who dreams of rising up from poverty to do something big
 lekin kya ye nahin jaanata
 He often writes his pain and words in the notebook
 safeena (aalia bhatta) muraad kii garlfriend he
 Who belongs to a good family
 donon ke stats main jameen-aasmaan kaa fark he, isliye unka romance chori chhipe chalata he
 Meanwhile, Murad's father Shakir (vijay Raj) performs a second marriage
 duusari ammi ke aane ke baad apni maa kii dayaneey haalat dekhakar muraad dukhi rahata he
 He is afraid of his father and obeys everything he says
 muraad kii jindagi main yutern mashhoor raper emasi sher (siddhant chaturvedi) kii entry hone ke baad hoti he
 MC Sher is a famous rapper
 muraad bhi emasi sher kii tarah bananaa chahta he
 He takes rap training from her
 is bich pita ke biimaar hone kii vajah se muraad ko ghar kii jimmedaari uthaani padati he
 He works as a driver instead of a father
 mujeec programmer ski (kalki kochalin) muraad or emasi sher ko gane kaa ofer detii he
 This song creates a sensation
 tab muraad ke gali boy banane kaa safar shuru hota he
 But Murad's father is against rap
 naukari or rap practice ke bich phir kaise uski jindagi karavat leti he
 To know how Murad fulfills his dream of becoming a rapper, you will have to watch the film
 actingtriller dekhakar laga tha ki gali boy kii kahani main sirf ranvir hi chhaae rahenge
 But it would be wrong to say so
 movie main aalia bhatt or siddhant chaturvedi ko bhi baraabar spes mila he
 In many scenes, Aaliya and Siddhant are overshadowed by Ranveer
 ranvir kaa karactor zyaadaatar daraa or sahamaa dikhaa he, jo apane pita ke saamne jubaan nahin kholta he
 This is also the reason why Ranveer's role was seen to be tainted by alia-siddhant
 siddhant movie kaa sarprise factor hai
 They have done a great job
 raper ke swag, atitude, body language or expressant ko unhone bakhubi pakadaa he
 siddhanta-aliya gets overwhelmed when he comes on screen
 alahad, bold, agressive or hatheli ladki ke role main aalia ne damdaar abhinay kiya he
 Vijay Raj plays the role of Khadus father
 kalki kochalin choti si bhoomika main thik thaak lagi hai

 This film is treat for the fans of rap culture
 gali boy ke gane movie relies se pehle hi hit ho chuke hai
 Ranveer has got his singing talent ironed
 unki aawaaj main bane gane shandaar ban pade hai
 Lyrics of all songs are strong and connect directly to the heart
 kai sikvence main filmaae gaye rap battle jabardast ban pade hai
 Movie dialogues are good
 aalia bhatta or ranvir singh kii fresh peyaring asardaar he
 After watching Gully Boy, the fans would definitely like to see him again in a movie
 kyon nahin dekhengli boy kii kahani behad simple or saral he
 Perhaps this is also the major reason for its weakness
 movie main antertenment or bollywood filmon ke hit masaalon kii kami akharati he
 If you think of theater entertainment, you will surely return disappointed
 film kaaphi lambii he
 First half bore
 joya akhtar ne interval kirdaaron kii bhoomika baandhne main hi khatm kar diya
 The second half slowly picks up speed, but the story slows down again
 movie darshakon ko baandhe rakhane main buree tarah se naakaamayaab sabit hoti he
 Glee By's climax is disappointing
 kahani main dam nahin he
 Ranveer Singh's passion to become a rapper, Struggle could have been introduced in a much better way
 garibi kii bediyon ko todakar ranvir ne parivaar or apane samaaj ke daayre se upar uthakar kuch bada karne kaa sapana dekha, lekin uski kahani main dard or jununiyat kii kami saaf jhalki
 There is a tremendous buzz about Gully Boy based on box office wrap music
 film kaa bajet 50 karod ke kareeb bataaya ja rahaa he
 The movie has earned up to 8 crores from advance booking
 film ko vailemtine wyk main relies hone phayda milegaa
 Gully Boy is also getting a long weekend of 4 days
 single relies hone kii vajah se movie ke box offis par acha collection karne kii puri ummid he
 The rest of the collection will depend on the word of mouth

 At the same time, the BJP wanted that the proceedings of the House should begin and the mlas should be administered oath
 rajyapal kaa abhibhaashan ho or phir iske baad hi devendra fadanvis sarkaar ko bahumat siddh karne kaa samay tay kiya jaae
 All these arguments of the BJP have been rejected by the Supreme Court

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) BJP lost 6 seats in the Haryana Assembly elections, a majority of the BJP, many star campaigners lost
 In Haryana, the Bharatiya Janata Party's mission with the slogan 'abki Bar, 75 Paar' has remained incomplete
 bhaajapa is baar bahumat ke aankade se dur he, manohar laal khatter kii aguwai main bijepi ko sirf 40 siten hasil huin
 That is, 6 legislators are needed to form a government
 agar nateezon ko dekhen to 7 siten nirdaleeyon ke khate main gai hai or yahi bijepi ke bahumat se dur hone kaa kaaran bhi bane hai
 Because four of these mlas are those who were not given tickets by the BJP
 koun hai wo chaar, jo bane the bijepi ke baagi?haryana main chunaav se pehle tikat vitaran ke dauraan bhaajapa ne khatter sarkaar ke prati anti inkambency hataane ke liye tikaton ko badla
 People from other teams came, many stars also landed
 lekin isi chakkar main apane naaraaz ho gaye
 Nayan Pal Rawat from Prithla seat in Faridabad: Contested the election independently due to lack of ticket from BJP
 bade antar se chunaav jeeta
 Sombir Sangwan from Dadri assembly seat: BJP too did not give ticket to him, instead BJP fielded Dangal girl Babita Phogat
 lekin nirdaleey ladakar sombir ne unhen hi maat de di
 The condition is that Babita of BJP stood at number three
 maham vidhansabha seat se balraj kundu:bijepi ne isbaar unhen tikat naa dekar shamsher kharkada ko mauka diya lekin ye balraj kundu ko raas nahin aayaa or baad main unhone nirdaleey hi chunaav jeet liya
 Here, rebel Balraj remained number one, BJP stood at number three
 pundari vidhansabha seat se randhir singh golan:bhaajapa se tikat naa milane ke kaaran baagi rukh apnaane vaale randhir singh ne is baar jeet darj kii he
 In 2014, he fought on a BJP ticket
 yahaan randhir pehle number par or bijepi ke ummidavaar vedapal edwocket tisare number par rahe
 Relying on the star, the BJP had to rely heavily on the Bharatiya Janata Party, this time cutting the tickets of many of its own people
 or yahi bhaajapa ko baari pad gaya
 Dangal girl Babita Phogat lost the election, wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt also lost and Tiktok star Sonali Phogat could not save her seat
 babita phogot:dadri seat se chunaav ladiin babita tisare number raheen, jabaki bijepi se baghawat karne vaale netaa jeet gaye
 Yogeshwar Dutt: Wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt lost to Congress candidate from Baroda seat
 congress ummidavaar krishna hooda ko 42 hajaar or yogeshwar dutt ko sirf 37 hajaar vot mili
 Sandeep Singh: In Haryana's Dangal, only one BJP star Sandeep Singh was able to win
 hockey star ne pehova seat se jeet darj kii
 Sonali Phogat: BJP gave ticket to social media sensation ie Ticketok star Sonali Phogat but she could not win
 adampur seat par sonaali phogot ko sirf 34 hajaar vot mili, jabaki congress ke kuldeep bishnoi ko 63 hajaar vot mili

 In order to calculate this, the Income Tax Department has recently updated the utility for ITR-2 and ITR-3 form, which has the facility to fill the folio numbers of ISIN and Securities
 kaarobaari or profeshnal itiar-3 kaa istemaal karte hai
 The ITR-2 form is filed by people whose income is not from business or profession and it is more than Rs 50 lakh per annum
 itiar-1 desh main rahane vaale ve log bhar sakate hai jinaki selary, ek makaan, sampatti, anya strot (byaaj) se kul aay 50 lakh rupee or krishi aay 5,000 rupee tak he
