 In Punjab, black medicine is called opium, but in what context are the ministers saying this, we do not claim it
 lekin cabinet main mantriyon kii yah baatcheet punjab main charchaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 The video of the Punjab government's cabinet meeting on 4 December was released by the state government

 In the video, some of Captain Amarinder Singh's ministers were counting the benefits of black medicine and during this time Captain Captain Amarinder Singh and all his ministers were seen laughing
 darasal, punjab main opium ko kaali dawaai kaha jaataa he
 Sitting next to Captain Amarinder Singh, senior minister Brahm Mohindra was telling the ministers that if you want black medicine, opium, then it will have to be brought from Rajasthan
 hamaare punjab main to kaali dawaai milanaa mushkil he
 In the beginning of the video, Punjab Sports Minister Rana Gurmeet Sodhi is also explaining the benefits of black medicine
 vah bhi video main kaali dawaai ko lekar apana paksh captain amarinder singh ke saamne rakhte hue dikh rahe hai
 On which Captain Amarinder Singh says do not drink or eat anything, on which the ministers of the entire cabinet start laughing

 nyaayadhish shyaamalaal ne aarushi or gharelu sahaayak hemraj kii hatya maamle main rajesh talwaar or noopur talwaar ko aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa sunaate hue 26 kaaran rekhaankit karte hue mangalvaar ko kaha ki nishchit taur par koi sidhaa saboot nahin he, lekin sibiai ne ‘thos paristhitijanya saboot’ rakhe hai jiske aadhaar par talwaar dampati ko hatya maamle main doshi tehraaya gaya he
 The 210-page judgment outlines 26 circumstances based on which the couple is convicted
 faisle main kaha gaya, 'abhiyojan paksh ne maukhik or dastavej ke rup main jo saboot rakhe usase adaalat is prabal or trutiheen nishkarsh par pahunchaa he ki donon aaropee vyakti hi is aparaadh ko anjaam dene ke liye jimmedaar hai kyonki nimna paristhitiyaan aropiyon ke aparaadh kii pariklpana kii ore ingit karti hai
 Firstly, Talwar's driver Umesh Sharma had last seen the accused between 15 and 16 May 2008 and before that fateful night, at 9:30 pm in the flat number L-32 of Climate Vihar with both the victims
 doosraa, yah ki 16 may 2008 ko subah kareeb chah baje aarushi aropiyon ke shayankaksh ke bagal sthit apane shayankaksh main mrit mili thi or donon kamaron ke bich sirf ek diwaar hi thi
 The body of the third servant Hemraj was found on the roof of flat number L-32 on 17 May 2008 around which blood was spilled
 chat kaa taala andar se band mila
 Citing other reasons, the judge said that the fourth reason stated that the time difference between the time when both the accused and the victims were last seen and when they were murdered on 15 and 16 May 2008 is very short, hence apart from the accused It is impossible to commit a crime by anyone else
 paanchvaan yah ki aarushi ke shayankaksh ke daravaaje main khud hi band hone vaala taala laga hua tha
 Mahesh Kumar, the then Superintendent of Police (city) of Noida, said that on the morning of 16 May 2008 he spoke to Rajesh Talwar, locking the door of Aarushi's room from outside and went to sleep
 donon aropiyon ne sweekaar kiya he ki aarushi ke shayankaksh main hotel kii tarah khud ba khud band hone vaala taala laga hua tha
 It cannot be opened without key from outside, but it can be opened from inside without key
 is bare main aropiyon dwaara koi spashtikaran nahin diya gaya ki aarushi ke kamare kaa darwaja kaise khulaa or kisne kholaa
 The sixth reason is that the internet was on that night, which makes it clear that one of the accused was awake
 yah ki yah dikhaane ke liye kuch bhi nahin he ki raat ke saadhe nau baje ke baad koi bhi bahari vyakti ghar ke bheetar aayaa
 That there was no interruption in the power supply that night
 raat ke samay kisi bhi vyakti ko flats ke paas sandigdh paristhiti main ghoomte hue nahin dekha gaya
 That there is no evidence of any outsider forcibly entering the flat on the day of the incident
 flats main chori kaa koi saboot nahin he
 That on the morning of 16 May 2008, when the maid came to clean the flat, Nupur Talwar made a false excuse that the servant Hemraj might have locked the door from outside while the lock was not locked from outside
 yah ki gharelu naukaraani bharti mandal ne kahin bhi yah nahin kaha ki jab vah ghar ke bheetar ai to donon aaropee ro rahe the

 According to the author and publisher, this is the main point of compiling the book 'forgotten Beside Revolutionaries', which should be given to those who are due, which is appropriate
 isi uddeshy ko dhyaan main rakhkar lekhakadvay ne do varshon tak shodhakarya kar is pustak kaa sangyojan kiya
 Therefore, there is hope that there is someone who is trying to expose their tarnished image at the national level by giving respect to these souls at the national level and the heroic sons of Mother Bharati who were pushed into the deep past of the past , Is commemorating the patriotic patriots, martyrs, sacrifices

 In a leading English-language newspaper, a political commentator wrote that this step to honor Savarkar has been taken so that his role in the conspiracy to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi can be called a 'white granddaughter'
 saavarkar ke khilaaf koi pramaan nahin mili
 Informant Digambar Bagade made a statement that he had heard Savarkar wishing Godse to succeed in his goal, but the court did not believe him
 nyaayalay ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke shadyantr ke maamle main saavarkar ko bizzat bari kar diya
 The aim of the then government was to trap the leader of the 'hindu Mahasabha' in this case
 yah makasad puraa ho chukaa tha
 But even after the death of this great patriot, mud continues to be thrown at him
 saavarkar ek krantikari the or kisi tarah jail se chhootakar swatantraaa andolan se judana chaahate the
 He was more well known by the British rulers than our famous historians
 rashtriya puralekhon main aise dastavej hai, jinase is baat kaa pataa chalata he ki british shaasha saavarkar or unki yachika ke bare main kya sochate the
 When Savarkar was imprisoned in the Andaman Islands, much was being said about his mercy petition before the British government in 1913
 bipinchandra tathaa unke gut ke pramukh itihaaskaaron ne is mudde ko baar-baar uthaaya he
 He should have known that between 1911 and 1920, he was petitioned eight times, not to release Savarkar
 ve aise satyagrahi nahin the
 Criticism silenced British Home Minister Macpherson had made a comment on Savarkar's petition
 unhone likhaa- 'saavarkar ko chhodana british samrajya ke liye khatarnaak sabit hoga
 His petition is a trick to get out of jail
 ek baar chhot gaya to vah british shaasha ke khilaaf bhumigat andolan ko phir sangathit kar legaa
 Therefore, i cancel this petition on the basis that it will endanger the safety of the public
 ''bharat ratna' diya janaa chahie vir saavarkar kovinayak damodar saavarkar bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke aise javalyamaan nakshatra hai, jinaki chamak kabhi feeki nahin hogi
 He was an ardent patriot who volunteered to accept his pleasures in a complete way and willingly accepted the path of struggle
 desh ke liye ghor kashton main bhi jeene or swatantraaa ke liye lagaataar bhageerath praytn karne ko unhone apana jivan-lakshya banaaya
 He belonged to that early generation of revolutionaries, in whom the innate talent was pompous
 shyaamaji krishna verma, lala hardayal, vinayak saavarkar or rasbihari bose bhi ucch shiksha praapt evam anek vishyon ke vidvan the to vinayak damodar saavarkar itihasajna, lekhak, kavi, upanyaaskaar, darshanik, samaaj-sudhaarak tathaa duuradrushti rakhane vaale drashtaa the
 It was also no coincidence that Veer Savarkar was born into the family, whose three sons were independent freedom fighters
 bade bhai ganeshapant (babarao) saavarkar ko aaajeevan kaale pani kaa dand mila or chote bhai dow
 Narayanrao (bal) Savarkar also had to remain imprisoned in connection with the bombing of Lord Minto
 vastav main saavarkar bandhuon ne chapekar bandhuon ke amar balidaan se prerana lee thi
 Damodar, Balkrishna and Vasudev Chapekar also hanged while worshiping the goddess of independence
 16 may, 1899 ke din vasudev chapekar tathaa unki sahyogi mahadev rande ko phaansi hui
 As soon as the news of his martyrdom was received, 16-year-old Tarun Vinayak Savarkar pledged to fight for the freedom of the country born in front of his Kuldevi in bhagur
 yah aisi bhishma pratigya thi, jise unhone aksharshah nibhaayaa
 In India, Vinayak Savarkar was the first to burn Holi of foreign clothes
 bharat main kanoon kii shiksha puri kar ve barrister kii shiksha ke liye landan gaye to vahaan ke ‘india house’ ko krantikariyon kaa centre bana diya
 While studying in London, Savarkar wrote the character of Magini, which was sold out as soon as it was published
 iske baad unhone ‘1857 kaa swatantry samar’ likhaa, jo vilakshan shodh-granth tha
 In London, his disciple Madanlal raised the Indian independence in England by paying the death penalty to Curzon Vayali
 in sabake baad bhi saavarkar kaise bache rahete
 When the British government planned to bring them captive to India, Savarkar jumped into the sea near the port of Marsoli in France and swam to the French land
 angrej police ne antarrashtriya kanoonon ko datta bataate hue saavarkar ko phir bandi bana liya or bharat laakar do-do aajanm kaid kii sajaa suna kalapani (andaman) bhej diya
 For ten years Veer Savarkar endured inhuman torture in Andaman
 cellular jail main unhone chhilake koote, kolhu chalaaya, hathkadiyon main ekaaki kaid bhi bhugti or bheeshan beemaari kaa saamana kiya
 In between all this, he maintained the practice of studying, as well as the work of cremating and awakening the prisoners

 In this way, he wrote and memorized about 14 thousand lines of poems

 When the British government was bringing Veer Savarkar from London to India, he jumped from the ship into the sea and swam to the French city

 Madame Cama went to the Hague International Court on this
 yah alag baat he ki british dabaav main 24 farvari, 1911 ko mukadmaa khaarij ho gaya, par france main baghawat ho gai
 The Prime Minister had to resign
 ab 99 saal baad marciles ke meyar ne apni sarkaar ko chitthee likhi he ki ham chaahate hai ki samudr kinare saavarkar kii murti lage
 But neither this letter was leaked, nor the government sent a reply

 You will ask, why only on Wednesday, then tell that it was July 8 on Wednesday
 aath july, 1910 ko hi france sarkaar ne saavarkar ko angrejon ke hawaale kiya tha, so gopinath munde ne khaskar yahi din chunaa
 Today, the centenary year of that event has started, so this is the special year of idolization
 munde ne sarkaar se poocha, 'sarkaar jawaab kyon nahin de rahi
 'the government's pride was tied up
 maamla vipaksh ke netaa adwani ko uthaanaa padaa, to teesraa morcha kholaa sushamaa swaraj ne
 If Aanat aap hai, Narayanasamy said that he would talk to the foreign minister on this issue

 Now the congress government is also in trouble over installing the idol in France

 In this way, her shouting and screaming does not leave many's throat, because by the time the oil was low enough by the evening, everyone would see the men littering and punishing the prisoners with lots of punches and punches

 In the end they were punished for doing work, given less food
 aakhir suparintendent ne yah anubandh kiya ki teen din puraa kaam karenge to aapako kolhu se hataa denge
 According to him, Mr
 Shree worked for three days, keeping the Vaidik classical rule on the table for a long time, but seeing him bowing so much, Bari turned his eyes like a parrot and broke the contract and sent him back to the crusher
 unhone munhatod uttar diya, -kaam nahin karenge! ham bail nahin, manushya hai
 'it was here that the first strike began

 Those who joined the Rajbandi strike started getting punished
 aath din hathkadi-bedi, kothri bandi aadi niyamantargat dand to die hi gaye, niyam viruddh dand bhi die gaye
 The above-mentioned Mr
 who behaved like a fearless person, was given ten or ten, twelve-twelve days to eat nothing but kanji in order to break his pride
 karagrih main yah niyam nahin he ki das-das din keval kanji par rakhaa jaae, parantu is aashaa se ki is tarah maatr do-teen baar die gaye maand par rahakar unki shakti ksheen ho jaaegi or manobal tut jayega
 This punishment was given, but it is not written in the sentence of a prisoner

 i was sworn by these companions that on the one hand they were kept on that platform, on the other hand, if opposed, Kunen's sips would be poured into their throats
 isse unhen chakkar aa jaataa, pet main tikhi jalan hone ke kaaran bahut adhik ksht hota, parantu in saare atyaacharon ke saamne hadataalwalon ne hathiyaar nahin daale
 Not only that, knowing that these prisoners have a firm organization and seeing their patience, the inhuman dominance of Bari on other detainees is also flying, they were assured that you will no longer be sent to the crusher
 anya bandiyon kii tarah tum logon ko bhi karagrih ke bahari tapuon main kaam karne ke liye choda jayega
 From the information given to the prisoners outside the prison, it was known that there is abundant freedom outside
 iske atirikt ek baar apane baahar nikalne ke adhikaar par mohar lagavaali jaae to phir uske anushang se paanch varshon ke pashchaat swatantra kaam karne kaa or das varshon ke pashchaat ‘tikat’ lekar ghar basaane kaa adhikaar praapt karne kaa prasang aayega- yah jaanakar rajbandiyon kii utkar ichha thi ki kisi prakaar yahan se baahar nikalen

 tathaapi baari kii kushagra na sahi, parantu moti buddhi ne yah sabhi ko dikhaaya
 In order to mark on the mind of the superintendent how rowdy and stubborn the Rajbandis are, Bari had informed the sergeant that one or two of them should be plowed into the car as soon as they drove out the arrogant and fearless people
 gaadi khinchne kaa aadesh dete hi un nidar logon ne taka sa jawaab de diya ki ham bail nahin, jo manushyon kii gaadi khinchen
 Bari said to the superintendent with a blush, 'see, how bad these people are

 Now when they are taken out, they say they will not pull the car

 On March 3, 1907, at a huge rally in Lyallpur, the editor of the newspaper 'zhang Syal', Bankedayal, sang a song, which had the lyrics - 'pagdi Sambhal Jatha, Pagri Sambal Oy', this song became so popular that this movement was in history 'turban Sambhal Called 'jatha' movement

 pakistan main teji se fail rahi dehshatgardon kii ye fouj duniya ke liye ban chuki he sabase bada khatra lekin in khatarnaak aatankiyon kaa sabase bada nishaanaa he bharat
 The report after the Mumbai attacks of the US organization RAND, Research and Development Corporation, also reveals how the Pakistani army and its intelligence agency is fueling this demon of terrorism
 report main ye baat belaag tareeke se kahi gai he ki pakistan main dehshatgardi asal main uski sena or khufia angesi iesai ke agenda kaa hi vistaar he or jab tak pakistani fouj or iesai ko kaabo main nahin kiya jaataa dehshatgardi kii is muhim ko khatm karnaa mushkil he
 It is not hidden from the world that in Pakistan, the elected government there has been kneeling in front of the army and the intelligence agency ISI, and till this equation of power does not change, it is not possible to control terrorism
 rand kii report ke mutabik bharat kii naakaam suraksha or khufia tantra bhi use dehshatgardi kaa aasaan nishaanaa bana detii he
 Many major terrorist incidents in Mumbai and earlier are enough to prove that whether it is a matter of sharing information related to the conspiracy of terrorists or a case of action on it
 bhartiya sulaksha or khufia agenciyon ke paas na to paryaapt training he na jaruri sajo-saamaan or hathiyaar or awwal to ye ki in agenciyon ke bich koi talmail bhi nahin he
 Then after the nuclear test, the Pakistan Army, IASI and terrorists have become convinced that whatever they attack, India will not dare to take any action against Pakistan and it has been so far
 aise main aatanki hamalon ko bardaasht karte rahane ke sivaa bharat ke paas koi doosraa chaara bhi nahin
 According to the report, organizations such as lashkar-e-taiba, which were earlier in love with the help of the Pakistani Army and the ISI, are now becoming self-destructive
 rand kii is report main aatankwaad ke masale par america niti kaa domuhaapan bhi ujagar ho gaya
 The US administration has been quoted as saying that the US wanted to avoid banning lashkar-e-taiba because it was afraid that it would affect its relations with the Pakistani military, while the Lashkar Militants have also been targeting his army in Kunar and Nuristan of Afghanistan
 jaahir he pakistan main punap rahe is aatankwaad ke khatme ke liye puri duniya ko ekajute hona hoga

 abhi over speeding par chaar sau rupye dand kaa praavdhaan he
 On driving drunk, there will be a fine of ten thousand rupees, which is now two thousand rupees
 sharaab par jab do hazaar rupaya fine kiya gaya tha tab bhi wo rakam zyada thi lekin kya usase sharaab pikar gaadi chalaane main koi kami ai
 Is there sufficient number of traffic police forces and equipment in all cities from highways to enforce this law
 sarkarein haive par sharaab kii dukaane khol detii hai or sharaab pi kar gaadi chalaane par fine bhi badha detii he
 Shouldn't checking on the highway be done in the same way as in the cities of Delhi or Mumbai on the night of 31 December
 bharat main kai log laaparvaahee or dussahas ke kaaran helmet nahin pahante, magar zyaadaatar log badhiya quality kaa helmet nahin pahante hai
 It is seen worldwide that where there is poverty or there is more people from weaker sections
 vahaan log helmet pahanane se bachate hai
 That's why you see substandard helmets sold on the pavement across the country, which is the same as wearing or not wearing
 helmet na pahanane par pehle sau rupee kaa jurmaana tha jise ab 1000 rupaya kar diya jayega
 Not only this, the driving license for three months will be canceled
 badi sankhya main companiyaan delivery bvoy or girl ko bike detii hai
 Responsibility can also be imposed on such companies that they give the best helmet to their employees or else the penalty will be on them and not on the employee
 kya aisa praavdhaan ho saktaa tha
 Now if you are caught driving without a seat belt, then you have to pay a fine of one thousand rupees instead of hundred rupees
 yahi nahin ambulance, fire brigade kii gadiyon ko jagah na dene par das hazaar kii penlti lagegi
 If an ambulance is caught in a traffic jam, its responsibility will be on the car or jeep stuck in front of it or the traffic management administration
 das hazaar rupee kaa jurmaana kam nahin hota he
 By the way, people are now generally becoming sensitive about ambulances 
 aglaa praavdhaan he 18 saal se kam umr kaa baccha gaadi lekar sadak par niklaa to maa-baap bhi zimmedaar honge
 Three years in jail and a fine of up to 25 thousand rupees
 gaadi kaa registration bhi radd kiya ja saktaa he
 If the traffic police does not listen, then a fine of two thousand rupees will have to be paid
 hamaare desh main skool vine main thuns thuns kar bacchon ko le jaaya jaataa he
 It not only compromises on security, but it is also related to the weak economic condition of our citizens
 ek gaadi main zyaada bachche isliye bithaane par majaboor hote hai kyonki isse unka kharchaa kam hota he
 The new provision may increase the burden on such sections
 lekin suraksha se bhi kaise samjhauta kiya jaae
 This is also a challenge
 yatri gadiyon kii overloding par prati atirikt yatri ek hazaar rupye kaa jurmaana lagegaa
 Overloading of two wheelers will attract a fine of Rs 2000 and the license will be canceled for three months
 abhi agar aap ek bike par teen yatriyon ko baithaate hai to sau rupye hi fine lagata he
 a provision has been made to increase the compensation from Rs 25,000 to Rs 2 lakh in cases of hit and run
 sadak durghatnaon main maut hone par 10 lakh rupye tak muaavze kaa praavdhaan
 The new amendment simplifies the process of claim and settlement of third party insurance
 kya vaaki logon ko das lakh kaa muawza miltaa he, kitnon ko miltaa he
 The intention of the government is right, it is the position of every economic section in the policies
 jurmaana badhaane se durghatana kam hoti he yaa sadakon par trephic police kii maujuudagi badhaane se
 There are about five thousand traffic policemen in Delhi itself whereas the requirement of 10 to 11 thousand traffic policemen is there
 2100 gadiyon par ek police vaala he
 Which is not enough
 agar dilli main hi paryaapt sankhya me trephic police bal nahin hai to baaki shaharon kaa kya haal hoga
 Are all those killed in road accidents killed due to careless driving
 may maheene main kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne haive sector ke hissedaaron ke saath ek meeting kii thi
 In it, he said that it is not always the driver's fault
 kai durghatnaon ke liye galat ejineering bhi zimmedaar hoti he
 In the meeting of the stakeholders of the highway sector in this May, Union Minister Gadkari had said, i am directing that the DPR of the roads on which there are frequent accidents, those who have made the project report, should also be accused
 main ise kanoon main laaungaa
 Has the Union Minister included it in his new law, because in this context, i would like to refer to an article of a decorated Cherian in the Hindu newspaper on Tuesday
 cherian seve live foundation ke nideshak hai
 In Bengaluru, a child died after falling from a motorcycle due to a road pit
 police ne neshnal haive athurity ke ejeeniyar ke kilaaf bhi maamla darj kar diya
 NHAI later cited section 28 of its law, stating that if its officer acted with good intentions then there could be no legal proceedings against him
 adhikari ke khilaaf maamla daayar nahin ho sakaa
 Will Gadkari end this exemption from NHAI
 kya unhone kharaab road ke kaaran ejiniyaron par maamla darj karne kaa praavdhaan darj kiya he, bahut dinon se sadak tuuti rahati he, durghatana hoti rahati he, kya iske liye sarkaar yaa mantri ko book kiya ja saktaa he, kya pataa usne hi sadak banane kii manzuri na di ho
 It is easy for the police to convict the driver
 kai baar wo bheed ke dabaav main kaam karti he, usase pehle bheed apana faisla kar leti he
 In this law, why is there nothing about such a crowd at the time of the accident, due to which people run away and the person who could have been saved dies
 yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki adhik fine se durghatnaayen kam hoti hai yaa nahin, shaayad hoti bhi hongi lekin iskaa ek aarthik paksh bhi he
 In September last year, when i did prime time on this issue, a story of America was told by quoting 'washington Post'
 phir sunaanaa chahta hum
 This story was written by Radley Balko blogging on Criminal Justice
 tippaniyan a 32-year-old black woman named Nicole Bolden was traveling in a car one day
 tabhi saamne vaali car ne galat tareeke se you-turn kiya or brake lagane ke baad bhi bolden kii car takaraa gai
 He had two young children in Bolden's car, but the one in the front car called the police and Bolden was arrested
 bolden ke khilaaf pehle se hi trephic niyamon ke ulanghan ke maamle main teen-teen warrant jari ho chuke the kyonki kamazor aarthik sthiti ke kaaran bolden jurmaana nahin bhar pai thi
 a lawyer has said that we call it Poverty Violation, that means people are not able to pay penalty due to poverty
 beemaa kaa premium nahin bhar paae to jurmaana, jurmaana nahin de paae to giraftaar kaa warrant
 Bolden somehow filled the amount of surety in one court but was arrested in another warrant
 aise logon kii madad karne vaale vakeelon kii sanstha ne jurmaana raashi ko 1700 amareeki dollar se kam karaane ke khub prayaas kiye
 1700 US dollars means fine of more than one lakh rupees in Indian rupees
 kisi tarah yah kam hokar 700 dollar hua yani 42 hazaar se kuch adhik
 During this time he had to stay in jail for more than 1 month
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki yah aparaadh nahin he
 It is a mistake
 'washington post' kii report kahati he ki badi sankhya main log vakil tak nahin rakh pate hai
 40 percent of St
 Louis County's earnings come from fines
 america main haalat ye ho gai he ki bel band bharwane ke liye companiyaan khul gai hai
 It has become a business
 zaruri nahin ki bharat main bhi aisa ho hi jaae lekin fine kii raashi adhik hone par duusari samasyaon ko darkinar nahin kar sakate
 In many places, there has also been improvement from fine
 vaid driving license ke bina gaadi chalaane par ab paanch hazaar rupye kaa fine hoga jo abhi ek hazaar rupye he
 There will be a penalty of two thousand rupees instead of one thousand rupees for driving without valid insurance
 over speeding par halke yatri vaahanon par ek hazaar rupye kaa fine, madhyam darje ke yatri vaahanon par do hazaar rupye lagenge
 At present there is a provision of four hundred rupees penalty for over speeding
 sharaab ke nashe main gaadi chalaane par ab das hazaar rupye kaa fine hoga jo abhi do hazaar rupye he
 When two thousand rupees were fined on liquor, the amount was still high, but did it cause any decrease in driving by drinking alcohol
 kya is kanoon ko lagu karaane ke liye paryaapt sankhya main haive se lekar tamaam shaharon main trephic police bal or upkaran maujuud hai
 Governments open liquor shops on highways and also increase the fine for driving by drinking liquor
 kya haive par usee tarah se checking nahin honi chahie jaisi 31 disambar kii raat dilli yaa mumbai jaise shaharon main hoti he
 Many people in India do not wear helmets due to carelessness and audacity, but most people do not wear good quality helmets
 duniya bhar main dekha gaya he ki jahaan garibi he yaa kamazor tabake ke log zyada he
 People there avoid wearing helmets
 isliye aap deshbhar main footpath par ghatiya kism kaa helmet bikate dekhte hai, jo pahanane yaa na pahanane ke baraabar hi he
 There was a fine of Rs
100 for not wearing a helmet, which will now be reduced to Rs
1000
 yahi nahin teen maheene ke liye driving license radd kar diya jayega
 a large number of companies offer bikes to Delivery Boy and Girl
 aisi companiyon par bhi javabdehi daali ja sakati he ki ve sarvottam kism kaa helmet apane karmchaariyon ko den varna jurmaana un par hoga, karmchaaree par nahin
 Could there be such a provision? ab agar seat belt ke bagair car chalaate pakade gaye to sau rupee kii jagah ek hazaar jurmaana bharna hoga
 Not only this, there will be a penalty of ten thousand if ambulance, fire brigade trains are not given space
 trephic jam main ambulance funs jaae to uski javabdehi uske aage fansi car yaa jeep kii hogi yaa trephic prabandhan karne vaale prashasan kii hogi
 a fine of ten thousand rupees is not reduced
 vaise aam taur par log ab ambulance ko lekar samvedansheel hone lage hai
 The next provision is that if a child under 18 years of age comes out on the road with a car, then the parents will also be responsible
 teen saal kii jail or 25 hazaar rupee tak kaa jurmaana
 Vehicle registration can also be canceled
 trephic police kii baat na maani to do hazaar rupee kaa jurmaana dena hoga
 In our country, children are transported in a school van
 isse suraksha se samjhauta to hota hi he magar iskaa bhi sambandh hamaare nagarikon kii kamazor aarthik sthiti se he
 More children are forced to sit in a car because it reduces their expenses
 nae praavdhaan se ho saktaa he aise tabake par boj bad jaae
 But how to compromise security as well
 yah chunauti bhi to he
 Overloading of passenger trains will attract a fine of one thousand rupees per additional passenger
 towhilers kii overloding par 2000 rupye kaa jurmaana lagegaa or teen maheene ke liye license radd ho jayega
 Now if you seat three passengers on a bike, then only one hundred rupees is fine
 hit and ran ke maamalon main muaavze ko 25 hazaar rupye se badhaakar do lakh rupye karne kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Provision for compensation of up to Rs 10 lakh on death in road accidents
 nae sanshodhan main third party insurance ke clem or setlement kii prakriya ko aasaan bana diya gaya he
 Do people really get a compensation of one million, how many
 sarkaar kii niyat thik he, baat nitiyon main har aarthik tabake kii jagah kii he
 Increasing the penalty reduces the accident or increasing the presence of traffic police on the roads
 dilli main hi kareeb paanch hazaar trephic pulicekarmi hai jabaki zarurat he 10 se 11 hazaar trephic pulicekarmiyon kii
 There is a policeman on 2100 trains
 jo ki paryaapt nahin he
 If there is not enough traffic police force in Delhi itself, what will happen to other cities
 kya sadak durghatana main maare gaye sabhi log laaparvaah driving ke kaaran hi maare jate hai
 In May, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari held a meeting with stakeholders in the highway sector
 usamen unhone kaha tha ki hameshaa driver kii galati nahin hoti he
 Incorrect engineering is also responsible for many accidents
 isi may main haive sector ke hissedaaron kii baithak main kendriya mantri gadakari ne kaha tha, main nirdesh de rahaa hum ki jin sadakon par lagaataar durghatnaayen hoti hai, un sadakon kaa deepiar yani project report jin logon ne banaai he unhen bhi aaropee banaaya janaa chahie
 i will bring it into law
 kya kendriya mantri ne apane nae kanoon main ise shaamil kiya he, kyonki isi sandarbh main mangalvaar ko 'hindu' akhbaar main chape saji cherian ke ek lekh kaa zikr karnaa chaahunga
 Cherian is the director of the Save Live Foundation
 bengalooru main sadak ke gadde ke kaaran ek bachche kii motorcycle se gir kar maut ho gai
 The police also registered a case against the engineer of the National Highway Authority
 baad main enechaeai ne apane kanoon ke section 28 kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki agar uske adhikari ne acchhee niyat se kaam kiya he to uske kilaaf koi kanoonee kaarywahi nahin ho sakati he
 a case could not be filed against the officer
 kya gadakari enechaeai ko mili is chhot ko samaapt kar denge
 Have they registered a provision for registering a case against engineers due to a bad road, the road remains broken for a long time, accidents keep happening, can the government or minister be booked for this, does he know the road to be built Not approved police ke liye aasaan hota he, driver ko doshi bana dena
 Many times she works under the pressure of the crowd, before the crowd makes its decision
 is kanoon main durghatana ke vakt aisi bheed ke bare main kyon nahin kuch he, jiske dar se log bhaag jate hai or jisaki jaan batch sakati thi wo mar jaataa he
 It will also have to be seen whether more fine will reduce accidents or not, perhaps it will happen but it also has an economic side
 pichley saal sitambar main jab is masale par prime time kiya tha tab 'washington post' ke hawaale se america kii ek kahani sunai thi
 i want to hear it again
 yah kahani criminal justise par bloging karne vaale redley balko ne likhi thi
 The comments nichol bolden naam kii 32 saal kii ashwet mahila ek din car se kahin ja rahi thim
 Then the front car made a U-turn incorrectly and even after applying the brakes, Bolden's car collided
 bolden kii car main uske do chote bachche the lekin saamne kii car vaale ne police bulaai or bolden giraftaar ho gai
 Three warrants had already been issued against Bolden in violation of traffic rules as Bolden could not pay the fine due to weak economic conditions
 ek vakil ne bataaya he ki ise ham powarty vylation kehete hai yani garibi ke kaaran log jurmaana nahin de pate
 Failure to pay the premium for insurance, warrant for arrest if you fail to pay the fine
 bolden ne ek adaalat main kisi tarah zamaanat kii raashi to bhar di magar duusare warrant main giraftaar ho gai
 The organization of lawyers who helped such people made a lot of efforts to reduce the fine amount to less than US $ 1700
 1700 amareeki dollar matlab bhartiya rupee main ek lakh rupee se bhi adhik kii fine
 Somehow it was reduced to $ 700 i
e
 a little over 42 thousand
 is dauraan use 1 maheene se zyada jail main rahanaa padaa
 Lawyers say it is important to understand that this is not a crime
 galati he
 The Washington Post report says that a large number of people are not even able to hire a lawyer
 saint lui county kii kamai kaa 40 fisadi hissaa jurmaane se aata he
 The situation in America has become such that companies have opened up to get bail bonds filled
 baqayda ye bijness ho gaya he
 It is not necessary that this happens in India too, but if the amount of fine is high, we cannot ignore other problems
 kai jagahon par fine se sudhaar bhi aayaa he
 When two thousand rupees were fined on liquor, the amount was still high, but did it cause any decrease in driving by drinking alcohol
 kya is kanoon ko lagu karaane ke liye paryaapt sankhya main haive se lekar tamaam shaharon main trephic police bal or upkaran maujuud hai

 ek vakil ne bataaya he ki ise ham powarty vylation kehete hai yani garibi ke kaaran log jurmaana nahin de pate
 Failure to pay the premium for insurance, warrant for arrest if you fail to pay the fine
 bolden ne ek adaalat main kisi tarah zamaanat kii raashi to bhar di magar duusare warrant main giraftaar ho gai
 The organization of lawyers who helped such people made a lot of efforts to reduce the fine amount to less than US $ 1700
 1700 amareeki dollar matlab bhartiya rupee main ek lakh rupee se bhi adhik kii fine
 Somehow it was reduced to $ 700 i
e
 a little over 42 thousand
 is dauraan use 1 maheene se zyada jail main rahanaa padaa
 Lawyers say it is important to understand that this is not a crime
 galati he
 The Washington Post report says that a large number of people are not even able to hire a lawyer
 saint lui county kii kamai kaa 40 fisadi hissaa jurmaane se aata he
 The situation in America has become such that companies have opened up to get bail bonds filled
 baqayda ye bijness ho gaya he
 It is not necessary that this happens in India too, but if the amount of fine is high, we cannot ignore other problems
 kai jagahon par fine se sudhaar bhi aayaa he
 Now if you are caught driving without a seat belt, then you have to pay a fine of one thousand rupees instead of hundred rupees
 yahi nahin ambulance, fire brigade kii gadiyon ko jagah na dene par das hazaar kii penlti lagegi
 If an ambulance is caught in a traffic jam, its responsibility will be on the car or jeep stuck in front of it or the traffic management administration
 das hazaar rupee kaa jurmaana kam nahin hota he
 By the way, people are now generally becoming sensitive to ambulances
 aglaa praavdhaan he 18 saal se kam umr kaa baccha gaadi lekar sadak par niklaa to maa-baap bhi zimmedaar honge
 Three years in jail and a fine of up to 25 thousand rupees
 gaadi kaa registration bhi radd kiya ja saktaa he
 If the traffic police does not listen, then a fine of two thousand rupees will have to be paid
 hamaare desh main skool vine main thuns thuns kar bacchon ko le jaaya jaataa he
 It not only compromises on security, but it is also related to the weak economic condition of our citizens
 ek gaadi main zyaada bachche isliye bithaane par majaboor hote hai kyonki isse unka kharchaa kam hota he
 The new provision may increase the burden on such sections
 lekin suraksha se bhi kaise samjhauta kiya jaae
 This is also a challenge
 yatri gadiyon kii overloding par prati atirikt yatri ek hazaar rupye kaa jurmaana lagegaa
 Overloading of two wheelers will attract a fine of Rs 2000 and the license will be canceled for three months
 abhi agar aap ek bike par teen yatriyon ko baithaate hai to sau rupye hi fine lagata he
 a provision has been made to increase the compensation from Rs 25,000 to Rs 2 lakh in cases of hit and run
 sadak durghatnaon main maut hone par 10 lakh rupye tak muaavze kaa praavdhaan
 The new amendment simplifies the process of claim and settlement of third party insurance
 kya vaaki logon ko das lakh kaa muawza miltaa he, kitnon ko miltaa he
 The intention of the government is right, it is the position of every economic section in the policies
 jurmaana badhaane se durghatana kam hoti he yaa sadakon par trephic police kii maujuudagi badhaane se
 There are about five thousand traffic policemen in Delhi itself whereas the requirement of 10 to 11 thousand traffic policemen is there
 2100 gadiyon par ek police vaala he
 Which is not enough
 agar dilli main hi paryaapt sankhya me trephic police bal nahin hai to baaki shaharon kaa kya haal hoga
 Are all those killed in road accidents killed due to careless driving
 may maheene main kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne haive sector ke hissedaaron ke saath ek meeting kii thi
 In it, he said that it is not always the driver's fault
 kai durghatnaon ke liye galat ejineering bhi zimmedaar hoti he
 In the meeting of the stakeholders of the highway sector in this May, Union Minister Gadkari had said, i am directing that the DPR of the roads on which there are frequent accidents, those who have made the project report, should also be accused
 main ise kanoon main laaungaa
 Has the Union Minister included it in his new law, because in this context, i would like to refer to an article of a decorated Cherian in the Hindu newspaper on Tuesday
 cherian seve live foundation ke nideshak hai
 In Bengaluru, a child died after falling from a motorcycle due to a road pit
 police ne neshnal haive athurity ke ejeeniyar ke kilaaf bhi maamla darj kar diya
 NHAI later cited section 28 of its law, stating that if its officer acted with good intentions then there could be no legal proceedings against him
 adhikari ke khilaaf maamla daayar nahin ho sakaa
 Will Gadkari end this exemption from NHAI
 kya unhone kharaab road ke kaaran ejiniyaron par maamla darj karne kaa praavdhaan darj kiya he, bahut dinon se sadak tuuti rahati he, durghatana hoti rahati he, kya iske liye sarkaar yaa mantri ko book kiya ja saktaa he, kya pataa usne hi sadak banane kii manzuri na di ho
 It is easy for the police to convict the driver
 kai baar wo bheed ke dabaav main kaam karti he, usase pehle bheed apana faisla kar leti he
 In this law, why is there nothing about such a crowd at the time of the accident, due to which people run away and the person who could have been saved dies
 yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki adhik fine se durghatnaayen kam hoti hai yaa nahin, shaayad hoti bhi hongi lekin iskaa ek aarthik paksh bhi he
 In September last year, when i did prime time on this issue, a story of America was told by quoting 'washington Post'
 phir sunaanaa chahta hum
 This story was written by Radley Balko blogging on Criminal Justice
 tippaniyan a 32-year-old black woman named Nicole Bolden was traveling in a car one day
 tabhi saamne vaali car ne galat tareeke se you-turn kiya or brake lagane ke baad bhi bolden kii car takaraa gai
 He had two young children in Bolden's car, but the one in the front car called the police and Bolden was arrested
 bolden ke khilaaf pehle se hi trephic niyamon ke ulanghan ke maamle main teen-teen warrant jari ho chuke the kyonki kamazor aarthik sthiti ke kaaran bolden jurmaana nahin bhar pai thi
 a lawyer has said that we call it Poverty Violation, that means people are not able to pay penalty due to poverty
 beemaa kaa premium nahin bhar paae to jurmaana, jurmaana nahin de paae to giraftaar kaa warrant
 Bolden somehow filled the amount of surety in one court but was arrested in another warrant
 aise logon kii madad karne vaale vakeelon kii sanstha ne jurmaana raashi ko 1700 amareeki dollar se kam karaane ke khub prayaas kiye
 1700 US dollars means fine of more than one lakh rupees in Indian rupees
 kisi tarah yah kam hokar 700 dollar hua yani 42 hazaar se kuch adhik
 During this time he had to stay in jail for more than 1 month
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki yah aparaadh nahin he
 It is a mistake
 'washington post' kii report kahati he ki badi sankhya main log vakil tak nahin rakh pate hai
 40 percent of St
 Louis County's earnings come from fines
 america main haalat ye ho gai he ki bel band bharwane ke liye companiyaan khul gai hai
 It has become a business
 zaruri nahin ki bharat main bhi aisa ho hi jaae lekin fine kii raashi adhik hone par duusari samasyaon ko darkinar nahin kar sakate
 In many places, there has also been improvement from fine
 trephic police kii baat na maani to do hazaar rupee kaa jurmaana dena hoga
 In our country, children are transported in a school van
 isse suraksha se samjhauta to hota hi he magar iskaa bhi sambandh hamaare nagarikon kii kamazor aarthik sthiti se he
 More children are forced to sit in a car because it reduces their expenses
 nae praavdhaan se ho saktaa he aise tabake par boj bad jaae
 But how to compromise security as well
 yah chunauti bhi to he
 Overloading of passenger trains will attract a fine of one thousand rupees per additional passenger
 towhilers kii overloding par 2000 rupye kaa jurmaana lagegaa or teen maheene ke liye license radd ho jayega
 Now if you seat three passengers on a bike, then only one hundred rupees is fine
 hit and ran ke maamalon main muaavze ko 25 hazaar rupye se badhaakar do lakh rupye karne kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Provision for compensation of up to Rs 10 lakh on death in road accidents
 nae sanshodhan main third party insurance ke clem or setlement kii prakriya ko aasaan bana diya gaya he
 Do people really get a compensation of one million, how many
 sarkaar kii niyat thik he, baat nitiyon main har aarthik tabake kii jagah kii he
 Increasing the penalty reduces the accident or increasing the presence of traffic police on the roads
 dilli main hi kareeb paanch hazaar trephic pulicekarmi hai jabaki zarurat he 10 se 11 hazaar trephic pulicekarmiyon kii
 There is a policeman on 2100 trains
 jo ki paryaapt nahin he
 If there is not enough traffic police force in Delhi itself, what will happen to other cities
 kya sadak durghatana main maare gaye sabhi log laaparvaah driving ke kaaran hi maare jate hai
 In May, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari held a meeting with stakeholders in the highway sector
 usamen unhone kaha tha ki hameshaa driver kii galati nahin hoti he
 Incorrect engineering is also responsible for many accidents
 isi may main haive sector ke hissedaaron kii baithak main kendriya mantri gadakari ne kaha tha, main nirdesh de rahaa hum ki jin sadakon par lagaataar durghatnaayen hoti hai, un sadakon kaa deepiar yani project report jin logon ne banaai he unhen bhi aaropee banaaya janaa chahie
 i will bring it into law
 kya kendriya mantri ne apane nae kanoon main ise shaamil kiya he, kyonki isi sandarbh main mangalvaar ko 'hindu' akhbaar main chape saji cherian ke ek lekh kaa zikr karnaa chaahunga
 Cherian is the director of the Save Live Foundation
 bengalooru main sadak ke gadde ke kaaran ek bachche kii motorcycle se gir kar maut ho gai
 The police also registered a case against the engineer of the National Highway Authority
 baad main enechaeai ne apane kanoon ke section 28 kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki agar uske adhikari ne acchhee niyat se kaam kiya he to uske kilaaf koi kanoonee kaarywahi nahin ho sakati he
 a case could not be filed against the officer
 kya gadakari enechaeai ko mili is chhot ko samaapt kar denge
 Have they registered a provision for registering a case against engineers due to a bad road, the road remains broken for a long time, accidents keep happening, can the government or minister be booked for this, does he know the road to be built Not approved police ke liye aasaan hota he, driver ko doshi bana dena
 Many times she works under the pressure of the crowd, before the crowd makes its decision
 is kanoon main durghatana ke vakt aisi bheed ke bare main kyon nahin kuch he, jiske dar se log bhaag jate hai or jisaki jaan batch sakati thi wo mar jaataa he
 It will also have to be seen whether more fine will reduce accidents or not, perhaps it will happen but it also has an economic side
 pichley saal sitambar main jab is masale par prime time kiya tha tab 'washington post' ke hawaale se america kii ek kahani sunai thi
 i want to hear it again

 In September last year, when i did prime time on this issue, a story of America was told by quoting 'washington Post'
 phir sunaanaa chahta hum
 This story was written by Radley Balko blogging on Criminal Justice
 tippaniyan a 32-year-old black woman named Nicole Bolden was traveling in a car one day
 tabhi saamne vaali car ne galat tareeke se you-turn kiya or brake lagane ke baad bhi bolden kii car takaraa gai
 He had two young children in Bolden's car, but the one in the front car called the police and Bolden was arrested
 bolden ke khilaaf pehle se hi trephic niyamon ke ulanghan ke maamle main teen-teen warrant jari ho chuke the kyonki kamazor aarthik sthiti ke kaaran bolden jurmaana nahin bhar pai thi
 a lawyer has said that we call it Poverty Violation, that means people are not able to pay penalty due to poverty
 beemaa kaa premium nahin bhar paae to jurmaana, jurmaana nahin de paae to giraftaar kaa warrant
 Bolden somehow filled the amount of surety in one court but was arrested in another warrant
 aise logon kii madad karne vaale vakeelon kii sanstha ne jurmaana raashi ko 1700 amareeki dollar se kam karaane ke khub prayaas kiye
 1700 US dollars means fine of more than one lakh rupees in Indian rupees
 kisi tarah yah kam hokar 700 dollar hua yani 42 hazaar se kuch adhik
 During this time he had to stay in jail for more than 1 month
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki yah aparaadh nahin he
 It is a mistake
 'washington post' kii report kahati he ki badi sankhya main log vakil tak nahin rakh pate hai
 40 percent of St
 Louis County's earnings come from fines
 america main haalat ye ho gai he ki bel band bharwane ke liye companiyaan khul gai hai
 It has become a business
 zaruri nahin ki bharat main bhi aisa ho hi jaae lekin fine kii raashi adhik hone par duusari samasyaon ko darkinar nahin kar sakate
 In many places, there has also been improvement from fine
 nichol bolden naam kii 32 saal kii ashwet mahila ek din car se kahin ja rahi thim
 Then the front car made a U-turn incorrectly and even after applying the brakes, Bolden's car collided
 bolden kii car main uske do chote bachche the lekin saamne kii car vaale ne police bulaai or bolden giraftaar ho gai
 Three warrants had already been issued against Bolden in violation of traffic rules as Bolden could not pay the fine due to weak economic conditions
 ek vakil ne bataaya he ki ise ham powarty vylation kehete hai yani garibi ke kaaran log jurmaana nahin de pate
 Failure to pay the premium for insurance, warrant for arrest if you fail to pay the fine
 bolden ne ek adaalat main kisi tarah zamaanat kii raashi to bhar di magar duusare warrant main giraftaar ho gai
 The organization of lawyers who helped such people made a lot of efforts to reduce the fine amount to less than US $ 1700
 1700 amareeki dollar matlab bhartiya rupee main ek lakh rupee se bhi adhik kii fine
 Somehow it was reduced to $ 700 i
e
 a little over 42 thousand
 is dauraan use 1 maheene se zyada jail main rahanaa padaa
 Lawyers say it is important to understand that this is not a crime
 galati he
 The Washington Post report says that a large number of people are not even able to hire a lawyer
 saint lui county kii kamai kaa 40 fisadi hissaa jurmaane se aata he
 The situation in America has become such that companies have opened up to get bail bonds filled

 It is not necessary that this happens in India too, but if the amount of fine is high, we cannot ignore other problems
 kai jagahon par fine se sudhaar bhi aayaa he

" Is doing so in an effort to prevent India from posing a threat to its capacity
 ' The CFR said that Pakistan's focus is entirely on the threat posed by India, being said to be concerned with the US ability to carry out military operations to seize Pakistani nuclear weapons

 Input: IANS punjab main chunaav sir par hai or soobe main sattarudh shiromani akali dal-bijepi gathbandhan main daraar ke sanket milane lage hai
 The Punjab government has released a booklet on 'nine years of development in the state' but neither BJP nor any party leader is mentioned in it
 is bocolate ke jariye bataaya gaya he ki siem prakaash singh badal or dipti siem sukhbir singh badal hi rajya main vikaas kaa cheharaa hai
 The booklet has three small pictures of PM Narendra Modi in an inside page
 punjab sarkaar kii ore se jari is bocolate main soobe main kiye gaye vikaas kaaryon kaa bakhaan kiya gaya he
 Apart from CM and Deputy CM, Minister Sikander Singh Maluka, Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and State Revenue Minister Bikram Majithia have managed to make a place in this booklet
 saat maheene pehle mili the gathjod tuutane ke sanketapichley do baar se lagaataar soobe main satta par kabiz akali dal-bijepi gathbandhan main sabakuch thik-thaak nahin chal rahaa he, iske sanket beete march main hi milane lage the
 At that time, a delegation of BJP leaders from the state met PM Narendra Modi and demanded that the alliance be broken
 bijepi netaaon kaa kahana tha ki akali dal ke saath gathjod kii vajah se party kii chhavi kharaab ho rahi thi
 However, in June, nearly three months after the incident, bjp's national vice-president and Punjab in-charge Prabhat Jha put an end to the speculation that the alliance would break
 prabhaat jha ne kaha tha ki punjab main akali dal-bijepi kaa gathbandhan jari rahegaa
 And this relationship is not going to break
 bijepi or akali dal kaa gathbandhan varshon purana he
 The Akali Dal has been a part of it since the formation of the NDA in 1998
 centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii aguwai vaali endie sarkaar main bhi akali dal shaamil rahi thi
 The Akali Dal also has a stake in the current central government
 haalanki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko prachand bahumat milane ke baad se akali dal se iske rishte main talkhi dikhni shuru ho gai
 In Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, distance has been created
 The BJP gradually began to distance itself from its regional allies
 maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi aisa dekhne ko mila
 As far as Punjab is concerned, power here came in alternating between the Congress and the Akali dal-bjp alliance
 lekin 2012 main yah trend tutaa or akali dal-bijepi gathbandhan satta main dobaaraa vaapasi main kaamyaab rahaa
 But in recent times, there has been a decline in bjp's popularity in the state
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko 7 siton kaa nuksaan hua or 117 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main party 12 siton par simat gai
 The vote share was also down by 8 per cent compared to the previous election
 yahaan tak ki 2014 ke aam chunaav main bijepi kaa vot share 1
 7 fell and the party could win only two seats out of 13 seats
 image kaa damege control karne kaa maukahaalanki, punjab main aam aadmi party jis tareeke se ubhar rahi he, aise halaat main bijepi ke liye akali dal se gathbandhan todna itnaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga
 In the last Lok Sabha election, the Aam Aadmi Party won four seats
 party vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bhi bade paimaane par prachaar abhiyaan kar rahi he
 There is an anti-incumbency wave in the state, in such a situation that the Congress gets the benefit or the Aam Aadmi Party, it will come forward
 lekin bijepi agar gathbandhan tod leti he to ise kuch phayda bhi ho saktaa he
 During the last two-four years, the Punjab government has suffered a lot of infamy
 chaahe nasha kaa mudda ho yaa kisaanon kii aatmahatya kaa, rajya sarkaar kii saakh giri he
 On the issue of sutlej-yamuna Link Canal, the Punjab Government has suffered a lot
 agar chunaav se pehle bijepi sarkaar se alag ho jaati he to kam se kam wo piem modi ke chehre ke saath janata ke bich ja sakati he or unke vikaas kaaryon ke sahare damege control kar sakati he

 At the same time, Congress has made the failures of the state government the main issue

 Many years were spent chanting slogans, emailing in the newsroom
 do saal se lekar paanch saal tak log intazaar karte rahete hai, kai project main to 95 fisadi paisa tak de dete hai lekin project puraa hone kaa naam nahin letaa
 Builder developers have so much power that no political party goes to help such buyers
 isliye 7 april ko jab kendriya mantrimandal ne Real Estate (regulation and Development) Bill ko badlaav ke saath manzuri di to kuch dalon kii taraf se halki phulki sugabugahat to hui magar kisi ko pataa nahin chalaa ki is mudde main itani raajnneetik sambhaavna he

 The Congress says that the NDA government has weakened their 2013 bill

 The 2013 bill said, in order to prevent the builder from leaving their first project in the balance, and for another project, 70 percent of the booking money will have to be invested in the same project
 2015 ke bill main 70 pratishat kii maatra ko ghataakar 50 pratishat kar diya gaya
 The developer says that the delay in the project is due to lack of approval while the buyers believe that the main reason for the delay is to invest the money of one project in another
 jo bhi he bina manzuri ke project launch karne kii daleel bhi kuch jamati nahin he
 Many projects also hang in the balance for this reason
 maujuuda sarkaar ne 2013 ke bill main ek baat yah jodi ki agar manzur plan main koi badali kerani he to builder ko do tihaai karidaaron se ijazat leni hogi
 It also included residential as well as commercial real estate which was not in the 2013 law
 is bill main praavdhaan he ki centre or rajya str par ek niamak athurity hogi jiskaa sankshipt naam rera he

 What is the plan of the project, when will the work start, what is the legal status of the land, from contractor to structural engineer, all such information will have to be provided on the website of the regulator
 agar koi bhi soochna galat di gai to jurmaane ke saath-saath builder ko teen saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 a broker selling or buying a project flat will also register with the regulator
 niamak ke pramukh ko zila jaj kaa darja hasil hoga or 60 dinon ke bheetar niamak ko faisla dena hoga

 The regulator can also cancel a project
 agar samay par flats nahin mila to kharidaar byaaj ke saath apana paisa le saktaa he or yah byaaj 15 fisadi se zyada nahin hoga
 Now it is not clear that if someone asks, then the project owner should not take the money and throw it out

 As you know, the UPA started work on the real estate bill from 2007 when it was able to bring it to Parliament in 2013 and could not pass even after that

 Venkaiah Naidu said that by May 13, the House should decide whether to send it to the Select Committee or not
 congress kaa kahana he ki endie sarkaar ne unke 2013 ke banaae bill ko kamazor kar diya he
 If it becomes law then the builders will speak and the rights of the buyers will be killed
 2013 ke bill main kaha gaya tha, builder apane pehle project ko adhar main chhodkar duusare project main na laga saken iske liye booking kaa 70 pratishat paisa usee project main lagaana hoga
 The 2015 bill reduced the amount of 70 percent to 50 percent
 develper kaa kahana he ki project main deree manzuri na milane ke kaaran hoti he jabaki kharidaar deree kaa mukhya kaaran ek project kaa paisa duusare main lagaana maanate hai
 Whatever it is, the plea to launch the project without approval is also not accepted
 kai project is kaaran bhi adhar main latak jate hai
 The current government added one thing in the 2013 bill that if there is a change in the approved plan, the builder will have to get permission from two-thirds of the buyers
 saath hi rihaayshi ke saath-saath commercial real estate ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya jo 2013 ke kanoon main nahin tha
 The bill provides that there will be a regulatory authority at the central and state level, abbreviated as RERA
 uske upar apil ke liye bhi ek sanstha banegi
 All projects will have to be registered at rera's office
 yah panjikaran tamaam manzuriyon ke baad hi kiya ja sakegaa tabhi koi builder flats kii booking chaalu kar sakate hai
 Under this, the builder will have to make all the information public

 If any information is given wrong, the builder will face three years in prison along with the fine
 kisi project kaa flats bechney yaa kharidne vaale brokar kaa bhi regulator ke yahaan panjikaran hoga
 The head of the regulator will have the status of a district judge and will have to give a decision to the regulator within 60 days
 rajyon ko ek saal ke bheetar apane niyam bana lene honge
 If this bill becomes law, then such projects will also come under its purview, which would not have been completed at the time of its passing
 niamak kisi project ko radd bhi kar saktaa he
 If the flat is not found on time, the buyer can take his money with interest and this interest will not be more than 15 per cent
 ab yah saaf nahin he ki agar kisi ne sawaal kiya to kahin project vaala hi paisa pakadaa kar use baahar na kar de
 It has been claimed that this bill reduces the scope of black money exchange but it is not possible for me to understand how it will be reduced

 kuch kaa kahana he ki paardarshita ke baavjood real estate main kaale dhan ke len dein par isse roak nahin lagati he
 Yet does this bill protect the interests of consumers? jo bhi he bina manzuri ke project launch karne kii daleel bhi kuch jamati nahin he
 Many projects also hang in the balance for this reason
 maujuuda sarkaar ne 2013 ke bill main ek baat yah jodi ki agar manzur plan main koi badali kerani he to builder ko do tihaai karidaaron se ijazat leni hogi
 It also included residential as well as commercial real estate which was not in the 2013 law
 is bill main praavdhaan he ki centre or rajya str par ek niamak athurity hogi jiskaa sankshipt naam rera he
 An institution will also be formed to appeal to him
 rera ke daftar main sabhi project kaa panjikaran karwaanaa hoga
 This registration can be done only after all the approvals, only then a builder can start booking the flat
 iske tahat builder ko sari jaankaree saarvajanik kerani hogi
 What is the plan of the project, when will the work start, what is the legal status of the land, from contractor to structural engineer, all such information will have to be provided on the website of the regulator
 agar koi bhi soochna galat di gai to jurmaane ke saath-saath builder ko teen saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 a broker selling or buying a project flat will also register with the regulator
 niamak ke pramukh ko zila jaj kaa darja hasil hoga or 60 dinon ke bheetar niamak ko faisla dena hoga
 States have to make their own rules within a year
 agar yah bill kanoon ban gaya to vaise project bhi iske daayre main aa jaaenge jo iske paas hone ke vakt puure nahin hue honge
 The regulator can also cancel a project
 agar samay par flats nahin mila to kharidaar byaaj ke saath apana paisa le saktaa he or yah byaaj 15 fisadi se zyada nahin hoga
 Now it is not clear that if someone asks, then the project owner should not take the money and throw it out
 daawa kiya gaya he ki yah bill kaale dhan ke aadan pradaan kii gunzaaish ko kam karata he par yah meri samaj main nahin aa sakaa ki kaise kam hoga

 12:00AM sabhi ko 66wein ganatantr diwas kii shubhakamanaayen On the occasion of the 127th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar made a big announcement for the Paswan caste
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar kii jin vikaas yojanaon kaa laabh sirf mahadaliton ko mil rahaa tha, unka phayda ab paswan jati ko bhi milegaa
 Nitish Kumar made this announcement on the occasion of Bhimrao Ambedkar Jayanti organized in Patna by Union Minister and Lok Janshakti Party President Ram Vilas Paswan
 gauratlab he ki ab tak bihar main dalit samudaay kii sabhi jatiyon ko nitish kumaar ne mahadalit varg main shaamil kar diya tha
 Separate plans and development works were being done for these castes
 pichley kai varshon se ramvilas paswan kii yah maang rahi thi ki jab nitish sarkaar ne dalit samudaay kii sabhi jatiyon ko mahadalit varg main shaamil kar diya he to phir paswan jati ko kyon isse alag rakhaa gaya he? iskaa jawaab yah he ki kuch varsh pehle tak nitish kumaar or ramvilas paswan ke raste alag alag the or raajnneetik vajahon ke chalate nitish sarkaar ne paswan jati ko mahadalit varg se alag rakhaa tha
 But now that both of them have joined the NDA, Ram Vilas Paswan once again demanded from Nitish Kumar that the Paswan caste should be included in the Mahadalit class and he should also get all kinds of benefits
 ramvilas paswan kii isi maang ko maanate hue nitish kumaar ne shanivaar ko elaan kiya ki ab paswan jati bhi mahadalit varg main shaamil hogi or use bhi mahadaliton ke liye chalaai ja raheen vishesh sarkari yojanaon kaa laabh milegaa
 Addressing the program, Nitish Kumar said that the Mahadalit class was formed to bring the castes which had been marginalized for the last several years into the mainstream
 nitish ke is elaan kaa phayda takreeban4 fisadi paswan jaatiko milegaa
 Please tell that politically, this decision of Nitish Kumar is considered very important
 darasal, bijepi ke khilaaf dalit virdohi maahaul ke bich nitish kumaar bihar kii raajnneeti main ramvilas paswan jaise bade dalit netaa ko sadhakar apni raah aasaan bananaa chaahate hai
 There is also speculation of uneasiness among Bihar BJP leaders from the growing close between Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan
 donon dalon ke bich ek morcho ban sakane kii atakalon se bijepi par dabaav badhane laga he
 In such a situation, Nitish Kumar's decision will give further boost to these fears
 sarkaar ne abhi tak yojana ayog ke punargathan par koi faisla nahin kiya he
 Planning and Statistics Minister Rao Inderjit Singh gave this information
 yah puche jane par ki ayog kaa punargathan kab kiya jayega, singh ne kaha, ‘iskaa faisla sarkaar ko karnaa he
 When this decision is made, the government will inform about it
 ’ singh kii yojana mantri (swatantra prabhaar) kii niyukti se yah atakalein chal rahi thim ki sarkaar yojana ayog kaa punargathan nahin karegi
 On media reports about this, Singh said, 'I too have come to know about this from the media
 mujhe nahin lagata ki iskaa koi aadhaar he
 The minister was holding separate talks here on the eighth National Statistics Day

 It was from here that he went to Israel, Palestine and Jordan with other fellow students under the Scripps Howard Fellowship to study religious practice in the area
 is dauraan media main kiye gaye apane yogadan ke liye vah independent press association or imigrent seaving bank award se navaaje bhi gaye
 In addition to ABC, New York Times, CNN, The Progressive, he has written in several papers in India and Bangladesh
 nom chomuski ke saath unka saakshaatkaar kaaphi charchit rahaa
 But in view of the increasing influence of capital in the mainstream media and the problem of the displaced around the world, he turned to teaching activities
 baad ke daur main ek vigyaan patrkaar, saamaajik vishyon ke jaagruk lekhak, maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta, shikshak, shramik adhikaron ke samarthak or visthaapan vishyon ke visheshgy ke rup main unhone duniyabar main apni pahchaan banaai

 parth banerjee abhi pichley dinon dilli aae the, apni bangala kahaniyon ke angreji main chape sankalan ‘mujic box and moonshine’ ke locarpan ke silsile main
 The book has been published by Rubric Publishing and has a total of 18 literary stories from Bankim Chand Chattopadhyay to Sunil Ganguly
 sahitya ajtak ne is avasar kaa laabh uthaate hue parth banerjee se anaupchaarik baatcheet kii
 Asked that science, industry, education and now literature, you chose different fields in life all the time, any reason? Partha Banerjee's answer was that there are many learning opportunities in every age and field
 ek tarah se vyapak shiksha ke kai str
 
 
 
 apane anubhavon se main vartmaan shiksha paddati main har str par badlaav kaa himachati hum
 From my life i have tried to set an example
 yah puche jane par ki aap to ek shikshavid hai
 Then why did you feel the need to join literature, compiling Bengali stories and translating them into English? isaki koi khaas vajah? parth banerjee kaa twarit jawaab tha, kyonki main is kaam ko samrajyavad virdohi saanskrithik pratirodh andolan kahata hum
 If i had such an understanding of Hindi or Tamil languages, i would do the same thing in these languages
 is sawaal par ki aapkaa yah bangala sankalan ab angreji main bhi he, aapako apane is sankalan ‘mujic box and moonshine’ kii kahaniyon main se kis lekhak kii koun si kahani adhik pasand ai? parth banerjee kaa jawaab tha, "yon to sabhi kahaniyon kii apni khaasiyat he, par tagore kii kahani 'ek patni kaa patr', vibhuti bhushan bandopadhyaay kii kahani 'pani kaa jhonka', saiyad muztaba ali kii kahani 'nun pani' sabase acchhee lageen

 Do you have extensive experience of Noam Chomsky's work, including RSS, leftist organizations, US capitalist policies? What do you think is the biggest danger facing the world at this time, and does literature have the ability to solve it? But his answer was, "the world's biggest problem is climate change, property imbalance and unilateral historical income
" iskaa samaadhaan na dhundha gaya to duniya or maanav sabhyataa ko vinasht hone se nahin bachaaya ja saktaa

 - The center and the state need to follow the federal structure - More important than literal speech is the reference lecture
 -kendra-rajya sambandh main dilli kii vishesh jagah he, dilli kaa leftinent governor kisi anya rajya ke governor kii tarah nahin he
 -leftant Governor is bound by the help and advice of the Council of Ministers

 -leftinent governor ko mantriparishad ke saath saamanjasy banaakar kaam karne kii jarurat he
 According to the constitution, the Council of Ministers has to inform its decision to the Lieutenant Governor but this does not mean that the Council of Ministers is under the Lieutenant Governor
 justise divai chandrachud kaa faisla-sanvaidhanik jhagadon se loktantr ke lacheelepan kaa pareekshan hota he

 Claims of construction of Ram temple have also started in Ayodhya as soon as the election in Uttar Pradesh begins
 bijepi ke netaa yahaan tak daawey kar rahen he ki 2019 tak mandir kaa nirmaan ho jayega
 Well, it does not look possible
 ram mandir nirmaan main ho sakati he deree'ayodhya rivigited' ke lekhak purv ipies adhikari kishor kunal kaa kahana he ki yah kahin se bhi sambhav nahi dikhataa he ki 2019 tak mandir kaa nirmaan ho jayega
 He says that the trial in this case has not even started in the Supreme Court
 unhen nahin lagata ki do-teen saalon main supreme court sunwaayee puri kar koi faisla suna saktaa he
 The old notions rejected by Ayodhya Revisited believe Kishore Kunal as the author and he also testified in his book that there was a Ram temple in Ayodhya
 vahiin bhagwaan ram kii janmabhumi bhi he
 In his book 'ayodhya Revisited' he has disproved many old assumptions
 ayodhya gaya hi nahin tha babarjis ram janmabhumi parababari majisdka nirmaan kii baat kii jaati he use kishor kunal ne pramanikta ke aadhaar par khaarij kar diya he
 He says that Babur had nothing to do with the alleged Babri Masjid
 babar na kabhi ayodhya gaya, na to kisi mandir ko todaa or naa hi koi masjid banaai
 Babur did not break any temple In his book, Kishore Kunal freed Babur from the charge that he had broken a temple
 unhone apni kitaab main babar ko ek udaar kism kaa samraat bataaya he
 After all, who broke the Ram temple and when it was destroyed, the answer is also in the book
 kishor kunal likhte he ki auranjeb ke shashan kaal main 1660 main mandir tod kar masjid banaai gai thi
 It was here in 1858 that the first communal riot book has proved on the basis of the document that till 1858 AD, Namaz was also read and worshiped in that temple
 1855 een main pehali baar sampradayik danga hua
 After that the rumor was spread that the temple in Hanumangarhi was built during the time of Awadh Nawabs
 uske bare main afvaah failaai gai ki alamgiri masjid ke upar ye mandir banaaya gaya he
 Ayodhya is the birthplace of Lord Rama, Kunal said that for the first time in history it has been proved that the same Parram temple was there and the same place is the birthplace
 elahabaad hai court ke faisle ke baad ye sab pramaan aae hai
 Everything written in the book has been authentically written
 ilabad hoicourt kaa faisla 2010 main aayaa tha jise supreme court main chunauti di gai he
 Kunalkishore Kunal has been doing research on Ayodhya for 20 years, if he has been doing research on Ayodhya for 20 years
 unke paas kuch aise dastavej hai jo sirf unke paas hai
 The entire book is written on the basis of documents
 elahabaad hai courtne jin sabooton ke aadhaar par faisla diya uske baad pichley 6 varshon main kaaphi nae dastavej or pukhta pramaan kishor kunal ne apni kitaab ke jariye pesh kiya he
 Certainly, when the matter is heard in the Supreme Court, these documents can be very helpful in bringing the trial to an important place
 aaj jab tivi dekh rahaa tha to kuch is tarah kii panktiyaan uchhal rahi thim ki ab beyimaan bilderon kii khayr nahin
 No more dishonest builders will be saved
 shabdon se kis tarah tivi ek nakli hakeekat taiyaar karata he ye panktiyaan usee kii misaal hai
 Ask the common people, who are protesting day and night against the builders, whether the builders will not be well after the RERA law comes into force from May 1
 unki beyimaani khatm ho jaaegi
 Of course, TV knows that you do not have time, so it said that it is not good for unscrupulous builders
 jabaki usne yah nahin bataaya ki is kanoon ke baad bhi bilderon kaa kuch nahin bigadega
 This is said by those reviewing this law
 tivi ne yahi baat aapse chupa lee ki is kanoon se bilderon kaa kuch nahin bigadega
 Just gave a slogan that builders are not well off with RERA law
 rera kaa phul farm he real estate regulation bill 2013
 It was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 14 August 2013 by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation
 march 2016 main yah kanoon paas hua or ab ek saal baad ek may se lagu ho rahaa he
 During this period, there is no good report about the laws made by the states on the model of the central government
 kai rajyon main aisi gunzaaish chodi gai he ki builder batch jaaen
 But the media cleverly caught this jumla that you are no longer the builders
 kuch apwaadon ko chhod kar jo bhi awasaiya pariyojna aegi use rera se register karana hoga
 With a few exceptions, builders will have to understand what will happen
 bina register karaae koi bhi pramotor na to agrim raashi le sakegaa na hi booking kar sakegaa
 Even the agent selling the purchase of the flat will have to register in RERA
 kisi bhi project kii sari jaankaree rera kii website par hogi, isamen site, le out or project kab puraa hoga sab likhaa hoga
 70% of whatever money will be taken from buyers will be deposited in a separate bank account
 rajya sarkaron ko chhot di gai he ki 70 fisadi se kam bhi alag khate main rakh sakate hai
 Why this exemption has been given to the state governments, to benefit the builders or to the buyers
 yah tabhi pataa chalegaa jab aap tivi bilderon kii khayr nahin jaise jumalon se nikal kar dekhnaa seekhenge
 There is talk of creating a tribunal in the Real Estate Regulation Bill
 ise har rajya apane apane yahaan sthapit karegaa
 If RERA has not given a decision in favor of the buyers or the builder is not satisfied with the decision of RERA, an appeal can be made in this tribunal
 rera kaa ek praavdhaan he ki agar aavedankarta ko panjikaran ke liye aavedan ke 15 dinon ke andar rera se koi jawaab na mili to pariyojna ko panjikrut maan liya jayega
 The comments har rajya main ek rera hoga, jiskaa ek cheirperson hoga or do sadsy honge
 Whether such a small organization can register in 15 days by checking the layout plan, approval of the builders, etc
 is kanoon ke tahat vikaas praadhikaranon se hui laaparvaahee ko bhi saadhaa ja saktaa he
 There is also a provision for penalty under RERA
 agar pramotor ne sapantti kaa panjikaran nahin karaayaa to us par pariyojna kii kul laagat kaa das pratishat jurmaana lagegaa
 If not registered despite rera's orders, he could be jailed for three years or an additional fine of up to 10% of the estimated cost
 76,000 real estate companiyaan rera ke tahat register hongi
 According to an estimate, 2300 to 4488 projects are launched in India every year
 das lakh kharidaar in project main nivesh karte hai
 Projects which are already underway will also have to get registration from RERA
 is kanoon ko samajhnaa zaruri he
 Millions of people are upset with the builders
 kisi ko samay se flats nahin mila to kisi ko kharaab flats mila
 We should know how far the old suffering will come from the existence of RERA and how great the new experience will be
 kya quality or dizine ke sawaalon kaa jawaab bhi rera se milegaa
 Rera's full form is the Real Estate Regulation Bill 2013
 ise 14 agast 2013 ko awaas or shahari garibi unmoolan mantralay ne rajyasabha main pesh kiya tha
 The law passed in March 2016 and is now in force a year later from May 1
 is dauraan rajyon ne centre sarkaar ke banaae model par jo kanoon banaae hai unke bare main koi acchhee report to nahin
 In many states, such scope has been left that the builders survive
 lekin media ne badi chaalaaki se ye jumala aapako pakadaa diya ki ab bilderon kii kair nahin
 Whatever residential project will come up with a few exceptions, it will have to be registered with RERA
 kuch apwaadon se bilderon ko kya kya laabh ho jayega, ise samajhnaa hoga
 Without registering, no promoter will be able to take advance amount or make booking
 yahaan tak ki flats kii kharid bikri karaane vaale agent ko bhi rera main register karana hoga
 All the information of any project will be on rera's website, it will have written the site, layout and when the project is completed
 karidaaron se jo bhi paisa liya jayega uskaa 70 fisadi hissaa ek alag bank khate main jamaa hoga
 State governments have been given exemption that less than 70 percent can be kept in separate account
 yah chhot rajya sarkaron ko kyon di gai he, bilderon ko laabh pahunchane ke liye yaa kharidaaron ko
 This will be known only when you learn how to watch TV builders and not go out of the jumal
 real estate regulation bill main ek tribunel banane kii baat he
 Every state will establish it on its own
 agar rera ne kharidaaron ke haq main faisla nahin diya yaa builder rera kaa nirnay se santusht nahin hua to is tribunel main apil kii ja sakegi
 RERA has a provision that if the applicant does not get any response from RERA within 15 days of the application for registration, the project will be treated as registered
 tippaniyan Each state will have one RERA, one chairperson and two members
 itani choti sanstha kya 15 dinon main bilderon ke pesh kiye gaye le out plan, unki manzuri vagairah kii jaanch kar register kar sakati he
 Under this law, negligence of development authorities can also be overcome
 rera ke tahat jurmaane kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 If the promoter does not register the property, he will be fined ten percent of the total cost of the project
 agar rera ke adeshon ke baavjood bhi panjikaran nahin kara sakaa to teen varsh tak jail ho sakati he yaa anumaanit laagat kaa das fisadi tak atirikt jurmaana liya ja saktaa he
 76,000 real estate companies will register under RERA
 ek anumaan ke anusaar bharat main har saal 2300 se 4488 project laanch hote hai
 One million buyers invest in these projects
 jo project pehle se chal rahe hai unhen bhi rera se panjikaran lenaa hoga
 It is important to understand this law
 lakhon log bilderon se pareshaan hai
 If someone did not get a flat in time, someone got a bad flat
 hamen jaananaa chahie ki rera ke astitv main aane se puraani takalif kitni dur hogi or nayaa anubhav kitna shandaar hoga
 Will RERA also answer quality and design questions? kuch apwaadon ko chhod kar jo bhi awasaiya pariyojna aegi use rera se register karana hoga
 With a few exceptions, builders will have to understand what will happen
 bina register karaae koi bhi pramotor na to agrim raashi le sakegaa na hi booking kar sakegaa
 Even the agent selling the purchase of the flat will have to register in RERA
 kisi bhi project kii sari jaankaree rera kii website par hogi, isamen site, le out or project kab puraa hoga sab likhaa hoga
 70% of whatever money will be taken from buyers will be deposited in a separate bank account
 rajya sarkaron ko chhot di gai he ki 70 fisadi se kam bhi alag khate main rakh sakate hai
