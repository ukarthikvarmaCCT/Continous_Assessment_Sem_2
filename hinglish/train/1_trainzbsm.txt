 unhone kaha ki ipief ghotaale kaa pardaafash july main hi ho gaya tha, lekin sarkaar ne koi ection nahin kiya tha
 UP Congress President Ajay Kumar Lallu said that when the Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi raised and tweeted the EPF scam, then the Yogi government went into action and arrested two officials

 To be played from 00 pm

 This will be the final match of the season for Sunrisers Hyderabad, where they will now have the services of the highest run-scorer David Warner in this 12th edition of the IPL
 is match ke baad warner vishwa cap kii taiyaariyon ke liye australia laut jaaenge
 IPL: Warner's Armaan, who was caught by Smith's catch, could not make the T-20 world record after his return from suspension in the match tampering case, scoring 611 runs in the tournament so far
 johny beresto (445) pehle hi england laut gaye hai, jisase team ko antim do maichon main salaami jodi kii kami khalegi
 In the current season, the team has won five matches and warner-bairstow has played a fantastic role in all five
 uski haar ke liye madhyakram ke ballebaajon ke lachar pradarshan ke alaava antim overon main kharaab gendbaaji jimmedaar he
 Kings XI Punjab, led by Ravichandran Ashwin, will have to try important match opportunities in their favor
 aswin or tej gendbaaj mohammad shami kii chunauti se sunrisers ke madhyakram ke ballebaaj kaise nipatate hai, yah dekhnaa hoga
 Except for a half-century inning by Manish Pandey, none of the teams played a memorable innings in the middle order
 chot ke kaaran zyaadaatar maichon main baahar rahe sunrisers hyderabad ke captain ken williamson warner se sarvshereshth pradarshan chahenge jisase plaof main pahunchane kii raah aasaan ho sake
 Like Sunrisers, Kings XI Punjab also relies heavily on openers

 Nitish Kumar, who gave the biggest political blow to the NDA when Narendra Modi was made the bjp's PM candidate in September 2013, finally returned to the NDA on Saturday
 nitish kumaar ne 4 saal baad endie main dobaaraa shaamil hone kaa elaan kiya
 Nitish made this announcement by calling a meeting of the party's National Executive Council in Patna
 haalanki, sharad yadav nitish se alag raah par chal pade hai
 Sharad's supporters held a protest outside Nitish's house and in a separate meeting in Patna, the Sharad faction called itself the real party and said that the grand alliance is still going on
 nitish main bhavishya dekh rahi he bijepinithish kumaar pichley 13 saal se endie ke saath hai
 He was a minister in the Atal government, but in September 2013, he left the NDA stating that Modi was getting bjp's command against secular policies
 phir bihar main mahagathbandhan bana or ab ve lalu parivaar par bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaakar unka saath chhod endie kaa hissaa ban gaye
 Till recently, JDU was calling Nitish the most credible face against Modi
 atakalein to 2019 ke chunaav main unhen piem candidet banane ko lekar bhi thi, lekin congress se sahmati kii kam hi gunjaaish thi
 In the meeting with Sonia Gandhi, Nitish made it clear that he is not in the race for the post of PM, but in the fast changing events last month, Nitish left the opposition and now also became part of the NDA
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bihar main endie ne 40 main se 33 siten jiti thim
 Nitish's party had got only two seats
 bijepi 2019 main nitish ke saath kii badaulat jeet kaa ye record bihar main barkaraar rakhana chaahegi
 Therefore, Nitish's support is very important for his mission 2019
 ise bhi pade:bhartiya raajnneeti main modi jaisaa koi nahin, survey ke ye aankade gavaahambhjhf ke mishan 2019 par kya hoga asar?modi kii duusari pari yani mishan 2019 ko sunishchit karne main lagi shah-modi kii jodi ke liye nitish kaa is kheme main aana badi raahat he
 The BJP is hopeful that Nitish Kumar's joining with him will prove to be a major setback for the National Grand Alliance of the opposition
 upi main haal hi main bijepi ko badi jeet mili he, lekin 2015 ke chunaav main bihar main mili haar bijepi ke liye bhavishya ke chunaav ke liye bada khatra ho saktaa tha
 Opposition parties were engaged in solidarity efforts to surround BJP, citing the formula of the Grand Alliance of Bihar and frequent examples of Bihar's defeat
 tarika jo bhi ho, lekin nitish ke rup main bijepi ko vipakshi kheme main send lagane kaa bada mauka mila or ye shah kii ranneeti ke liye booster kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 With the advent of new allies, the BJP will now look to make inroads in areas where BJP has been less effective by adding new allies to the alliance
 tamilnadu main ediemke ke donon dhadon ko saath laakar dakshin ke is sabase bade rajya kii siyasat main entry ke liye bijepi baatcheet kar hi rahi he
 At the same time, BJP has raised its hopes alive in Bengal by performing the most effective after TMC in Darjeeling and other local body elections in West Bengal
 raashtrapati chunaav ke dauraan tripura main tiemasi ke sabhi 6 vidhayak bijepi ke kheme main aa gaye
 Here too, the expectations of the party have increased
 purvottar ke anya rajyon arunachal pradesh, manipur, meghalaya dakshin main kerala, karnataka, tamilnadu main nae sahyogiyon ko jodne kii disha main ab bijepi kaam karegi
 Even if the opposition parties are saying that there will be no effect due to the departure of the Grand Alliance, the dream of forming a National Grand Alliance will be broken by the opposition
 nitish se baghawat par utre sharad yadav ne guuruuvaar ko dilli main 17 dalon kii baithak bulaai thi, jisamen rahul gandhi, seetaram yechuri samet tamaam dalon ke netaa bhi shaamil hue

 This perception has also been strengthened by the organization keeping a check on its behavior and activities
 dilachasp baat yah he ki RSS bharat ke un gine-chune sanghathanon main se he, jinaki sthapana swatantraaa ke pehle hui
 Now, after six years (the Sangh was founded on 27th September, 1925, on the day of Vijayadashami in Nagpur), the centenary of the Sangh is going to be completed, the Sangh is doing all it can to make some misconceptions about itself
 Could fix yah pehali baar he, jab RSS ke ek varisht prachaarak ne ek pustak ke madhyam se sangh ke andruni kriyalap, uski vichaardhaara, bharat ke prati uski drushti tathaa vibhinn vishyon par soch ko saamne rakhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Sunil Ambekar's book - 'the RSS Roadmaps for the Twenty First Century' - which has been playing the important responsibility of the organization's general secretary in the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a long-time student organization of the Sangh - tries to clarify the Sangh's opinion on all those subjects
 Which, RSS has been kept in the dock
 ambekar likhte hai ki hindu-muslim sandarbh main sangh kii soch shuru se spasht rahi he
 The Sangh believes that Ek Satta, Vipra: Often Vdanti
 isliye puja paddati alag hone ke kaaran hi bhedbhaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to Ambekar, this thinking was the fundamental difference between the Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha
 hindu mahasabha kii soch thi ki dharm ke aadhaar par pratinidhitiv milanaa chahie, jabaki sangh yah maanata tha ki chaahe jo dharm, panth yaa aasthaa ho, bharat un sabakaa he, jo yahaan paidaa hue or yahaan rahete aae hai
 The association talks of a shared cultural heritage
 iske liye ambekar bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru ko uddhrut karte hai, jinhone 24 janvari, 1948 ko aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay ke dikshant samaaroh main kaha tha - "aap muslim hai or main hindu
 
 
 We can believe in different religions or none
 
 
 lekin hamaari saanskrithik viraasat saajha he
 
 
 History keeps us together, so why separate present or future
 
 
 ?"ambekar likhte hai ki sangh bharat ke dharmik aadhaar par vibhaajan ke khilaaf tha or isiilie jab gandhi ji ne vibhaajan ko manzuri di, to sangh ne is nirnay kii ninda kii
 According to Ambekar, the Muslim League was primarily responsible for the partition of India
 bharat main rahane vaale musalmaan kisi anya desh main rahane vaale musalamaanon se behatar sthiti main hai
 They have more democratic freedom
 bharat main islam ke vibhinn panth hai, jo nirbhik hokar apni aasthaa ke anusaar upasna kar sakate hai, jo islamic deshon main bhi sambhav nahin he
 Ambekar also writes that the most important lesson taught in all the branches of the Sangh is that India is a Hindu nation
 aage likhaa jaataa he ki hindu raashtra muslim virdohi nahin he
 The book says that the concept of Hindutva is related to the Hindu nation
 kai log ise muslim virodh ke chashme se dekhte hai, jo puri tarah galat he
 The book quoted Sangh chief (sarsanghchalak) Mohan Bhagwat as saying, "our country is a Hindu nation, but that does not mean that Muslims are not included in it
" 
 
 jis din yah kaha jayega ki musalamaanon kii zarurat nahin, tab hindutv kaa astitv mit jayega
 
 
 "this book also refutes allegations that the Sangh did not participate in the independence movement
 ambekar likhte hai ki swayamsevakon ne gandhi ji kii aguwai main 'bharat chodo andolan' main hissaa liya tha
 According to British records, eight freedom fighters were hanged by the British at a place called Asti near Nagpur, two of which were Sangh volunteers
 ambekar ke mutabik yah sach he ki mahilaayein shakha kaa hissaa nahin hai, lekin RSS main kai mahilaayein sakriy hai
 Since the inception of the Sangh, a National Committee for Women was formed, whose programs, activities and departments are similar to the Sangh
 deshbhar main sangh kii gatividhiyon main mahilaayein baraabar kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi hai
 The opinion of the Sangh has also been clarified in this book on the question of language
 pustak kahati he ki sanskrit shuru se hi padhai jaani chahie
 Children should study in their mother tongue and earn modern knowledge
 sangh maanata he ki bharat ko vishwaguru banane ke liye sanskrit or sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon ko badhaava diya janaa chahie
 The Sangh believes that there should not be discrimination on the basis of language and all languages should be developed equally
 jammu evam kashmir ke bare main pustak main kaha gaya he ki aane vaale dinon main chaar bade kaam baaki hai - pehla, visthapit kashmiri panditon kii maryaada tathaa sampatti behaal karnaa; doosraa, pakistan ke kabze vaala kashmir waapas lenaa; teesraa, aatankwaad khatm karnaa or chauthaa, rajya kaa vikaas karnaa
 The Sangh does not consider Live-in Relationship to be true
 pustak main likhaa gaya he ki aise rishte samaaj ke liye nakaaratmak role model hai
 In countries where there are no strong family values, live-in relationships can be considered, but in India where there is a fully active family system, such relationships are not needed
 sangh maanata he ki antarjaateey vivaahon ko lekar takaraav nahin hona chahie
 If the boy and the girl are adamant on getting married, then the parents should give them their blessings
 samalangik sambandhon ko lekar pustak main spasht kiya gaya he ki sangh ke varisht padaadhikari dattatreya hosbhole ne kaha tha ki samalangikta aparaadh nahin maani jaani chahie
 He later said on the gay marriage that it should not be recognized, because it legalizes homosexuality
 haalanki samaveshi hona ek pramukh chintaa he
 The book quoted Sanghpramukh Mohan Bhagwat as saying that every person is a part of society
 samaaj badal rahaa he or hamen har kisi ko jagah deni chahie, taaki ve alag-thalag mahasoos na karen
 Ambedkar writes that the Sangh does not participate in party politics, but this does not mean that the Sangh is non-political
 sangh maanata he ki raajnneeti rashtravaadi honi chahie or raajnneetik kaary bhartiya samskruti ke anuroop hona chahie
 The Sangh does not interfere in the work of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 tikat bantwaare ke samay agar sangh se raay lee jaati he, to sangh feedback detaa he
 Beyond this, the Sangh does not interfere in election related decisions
 yah chunavi ranneeti tay nahin karata, jo raajnneetik dal kaa kaam he

 There is only a short time left in the Lok Sabha elections
 maahaul bananaa shuru ho gaya he
 All political parties have started preparing to enter the electoral arena
 magar aane vaale loksabhaa chunaav ke liye taiyaari sirf desh main hi nahin ho rahi he balki sarhad ke us paar bhi ho rahi he
 It is a different matter that the purpose of their preparation is something else
 america khufia agency ne ek report jari kar kaha he ki pakisataan main baithe aatankwaadi bharat main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan jagah-jagah dange failaane kaa mansuba banaae baithe hai
 The ruckus is created in the name of cow protection
 lav jihad ke naam par logon ko maaraa peeta jaataa tha
 There was a commotion in the name of Vande Mataram
 logon se jabardastee jai shri ram bulawaaya gaya
 Wise people in India do not support such uproar and violence
 balki wo kanoon par yakeen rakhte hai
 But in our country there are some people here and there
 jinhen asantosh main hi santosh aata he
 In this, they get leisurely
 lekin jane anjaane ye log desh ke dushmano kii madad kar rahe hai
 And there are enemies that are sitting by chance
 sarhad paar baithe unheen dushmano ko lekar khabar ai he ki isi saal aane vaale aam chunaav ke dauraan wo bade paimaane par sampradayik hinsa bhadakaane kii sajeesh rach rahe hai
 According to a report by the US Intelligence Agency, if Hindustani continues to fight among themselves, then Pakistan and terrorist organizations flourishing there can take advantage of this by organizing communal riots during the Lok Sabha elections
 america ke neshnal intelligence ke diarector dan kots ne kaha he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan paak main baithe aatanki sanghathan bharat par hamale bhi kar sakate hai
 According to this senior officer of the US Intelligence Agency, Dan Coats, director of the US National Intelligence, if the ruling BJP continues to insist on the Hindu nationalist theme before the general elections in May, then the possibility of communal violence in India is very strong
 pakistan samarthit aatankwaadi samooh bharat ke khilaaf hamalon kii yojana banane or anjaam dene ke liye pakistan main apane panaahagaahon kaa phayda uthaanaa jari rakhenge
 There are only a few months left for the Lok Sabha elections to be held in India
 in chunaavon par puri duniya kii najar he
 And this statement of the American intelligence officer who brought about these elections is disturbing
 america kii neshnal intelligence ke diarector dan kots ke kehane kaa labboluab ye he ki agar chunaav jeetne yaa kisi chunavi phaayde ke liye sattadhari party kattarta par utarati he to ye naa sirf khud bharat ke liye ghaatak ho saktaa he
 It is very possible that large-scale communal riots also erupt in the country
 kyonki pakistan to hameshaa se hi ye chahta he ki hindustan main muslim or hindu kabhi ek naa hone paaen
 It is obvious that PM Modi has repeated many times from public platform that the law will be strictly dealt with by those who forcefully attack people in the name of Gau Raksha or in the name of Love Jihad
 magar piem kii apil ke baad bhi kuch kattar hinduvadi sanghathan desh main aatanrik hinsa failaane kaa kaam jari rakhe hue hai
 Due to which, Pakistan is helping a lot to fulfill its objective
 aapako bataa den ki america main har saal kii shuruyaat main vahaan kii sabhi intelligence agenciyaan ek report jari karti hai
 In which all events occurring around the world are evaluated
 is report ko taiyaar karne main silect kamity ke saamne pesh hone vaale pramukh logon main dan kots ke alaava haal hi bharat kii apni yatra se lautin america khufia agency CIA kii diarector jeena haspel, epabiai diarector christopher re or diie ke diarector robert eshle bhi shaamil the
 The report on South Asia was part of their assessment of the worldwide threat in 2019
 america khufia agenciyon kii is salanaa report main hindustan main sirf sampradayik hinsa kaa andeshaa nahin jataayaa gaya he
 Rather, nuclear security incidents in South Asia have also been feared due to the continuous increase of nuclear programs of India and Pakistan

 Paswan's response: Terming the alliance between Janata Dal United and Rashtriya Janata Dal as a 'nautanki' ahead of the Bihar assembly elections, Union Minister and Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan today called on the governments of Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad for anarchy in the state Held responsible
 nitish-lalu se nahin hoga koi phaaydakendriya khaadya, upabhokta maamalon ke mantri paswan ne kaha ki RJD-JDU ke bich gathjod ‘nautanki’ he
 He said that if anyone should be held responsible for the chaos in Bihar, it is the rule of 15 years of Lalu and Rabdi Devi and ten years of Nitish Kumar
 paswan ne kaha ki nitish or lalu ke saath aane se bihar ko koi phayda nahin hoga
 NDA will get a pinch on the meeting between Chief Minister of Majority Bihar and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Paswan said, "they (nitish and Manjhi) are fighting over mangoes and you (nitish) are sending mangoes to Rahul Gandhi

 team india ke purv captain sunil gavaskar ne kaha he ki har saal jab bhi ipel shuru hota he kuch na kuch bahaane se iskaa virodh hone lagata he
 Gavaskar also said in his statement that there are some people who are jealous of the IPL and hence always someone tries to stop it with some excuse
 gavaskar ne haalanki ye kaha ki kisaan kaa jivan or uske halaat ko sudhaarna sabase badi prathamikta honi chahie, lekin sirf ipel ke 13 match baahar le jane se kisaanon kii haalat nahin sudharne vaali
 Not only this, there is also no guarantee that the water which will be saved from IPL matches will be passed on to the farmers
 tippaniyan Gavaskar also drew attention to the fact that 24 matches of the T20 World Cup were held in Maharashtra but no one opposed those matches
 abhi sirf 10-15 din hi hue hai un muqablon ko or uske baad hi sookhe kii baat saamne aane lagi he
 Was there no drought at that time? Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar warned that IPL has become a very big brand all over the world and we should make it bigger every year but if every year for some reason, IPL matches will be affected
 But it will also have an impact

 Those who fly the plane with their feet
 inke paas duniya kaa pehla license he jo kisi armales (bina haath) vaale payalat (world's first licensed armless pilot) ko diya gaya, is vajah se inkaa naam ginis book of records (guinness World Record) main bhi darj he
 Jessica is an expert not only in running the plane with her feet, but also in karate and her small activities
 aap khud hi video main dekhie jesica cox kis tarah siplan uda rahi hai
 Born in Arizona, US, in 1983, Jessica Cox had no hands since childhood
 inhone 14 saal kii umr se hi apane nakli haathon (prosthetic) kaa istemaal band kar diya tha
 Since then, Jessica has been doing all the work with her feet
 car chalaane se lekar, gas bharna, ankhon main lences lagaana, scuba diving or keyboard par tip karne tak, wo sabhi kaam apane donon pairon se karti hai
 Not only this, Jessica's typing speed is 25 words per minute
 
 Jessica Cox with her fiancée Jessica Cox with the Guinness Book of Record Medal antarrashtriya vyapaar sammelan wibrant gujarat se thik pehle ahmedabad main nikal rahi berozegaar yatra ne rajya sarkaar ke liye kaaphi mushkilen khadi kar di hai
 The yatra has the support of the young leaders of the reservation movement
 inamen alpesh thakor, jignesh mevani or hardik patel ke kareebi varun patel jaise netaa shaamil hai
 The Vibrant Gujarat summit is scheduled to be held in Gandhinagar from January 10 to 13, and immediately before that on January 6, the unemployed journey from Bahucharaji to Ahmedabad has been organized
 is yatra ko 'gujaratiyon ko rojgaar nahin to wibrant nahin' kaa naaraa diya gaya he
 Till now, all these young leaders were agitating in different areas of Gujarat for their demands, but their coming on one platform can increase the problems of the government
 pradhanmantri narendra modi 10 janvari ko wibrant gujarat sammelan kaa udghaatan karne vaale hai
 Before which he will also participate in many programs in Gujarat
 ab aise main vajahaberajagaar yatraase sarkaar sakate main aa gai he
 OBC leader Alpesh Thakur has demanded the government to make some concrete announcement for the job of seven lakh youth unemployed
 saath hi sammelan ke tahat gujarat main nivesh karne vaali companiyon main 75 fisadi gujaratiyon ko rojgaar dene kii maang bhi is yatra ke jariye kii jaaegi
 The leaders who led the yatra have said that if the government does not accept our demand, then all the leaders will come on one platform and protest against Vibrant Gujarat
 yatra ke ranneetikaar or dalit netaa jignesh mevani kaa kahana he ki agar 90 din main teen lakh yuvaaon ko rojgaar nahin diya gaya to sabhi netaa ek manch par aakar wibrant kaa virodh karenge
 Actually, this movement presents such a picture of Vibrant Gujarat, which can blow the claims of the ruling party BJP
 ye sammelan rajya main nivesh badhaane or rojgaar uplabdh karaane ke makasad se kiya jaataa he
 But right from that conference, these unemployed travel and unemployment figures are a problem for the government
 rajya kii rupani sarkaar ke liye takalif isliye bhi he kyonki 8wein wibrant gujarat sammelan mechantararashtriya netaaon se lekar pradhanmantritak shirkat karne vaale hai
 In this way any big movement can raise questions on law and order
 rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main ye pehla sabase bada antarrashtriya kaarykram he
 In this situation the government wants to avoid any kind of gritty while the young leaders are adamant on demanding concrete steps
 patidaar netaa varuan patel ne kaha he ki berogari patidaaron main bhi he, daliton main bhi he, obisi bhi berozegaar hai or adivasee bhi berozegaar hai
 That is why we came together
 sabko rojgaar hoga to koi andolan hi nahin karegaa
 The movement launched against the government is also claiming full support from the rest of the castes
 aise main sarkaar ise rokane ke liye har mumkin karne kii koshish main lagi he
 Claiming that his legal battle for birth anniversaries is for 'honor and dignity', Army Chief General VK Singh told the Supreme Court on Friday that a campaign to defame him was going on on the issue

 Counsel for the Army Chief said that there is no thought of sticking to the post (as Army Chief), if my date of birth is considered as May 10, 1951, then i am ready to leave the post at all
 peeth ne spasht kiya ki general singh kii eemaandaaree bedaag he or unhone apni shikaayat ke nivaaran ke liye yahaan aakar sahi kaam kiya he

 There is a chill between the Nitish government of the state and the Modi government at the center regarding the road construction project in Bihar
 nitish sarkaar ne kendriya sadak evam parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ke us bayaan ko jhootha qaraar diya, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki bihar main do lakh karod rupee kii sadak pariyojnaon par kaam chal rahaa he
 In a press release issued by the Bihar Road Construction Department, it was clarified that only 54 thousand 700 crore road project is going on in Bihar
 is pariyojna kii ghoshnaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ne saal 2015 ke chunaav ke dauraan vishesh package ke taur par kii thi
 The Bihar government has also rejected the allegation of Union Minister Gadkari, in which he said that the state government is delaying in giving land for road construction
 press relies main kaha gaya ki sirf chaar aisi pariyojaanen he, jisamen jameen adhigrahan kii prakriya chal rahi he
 Land has been made available for all other projects
 rajya kii vipakshi party argedy ise bijepi or janata dal (you) ke bich aapasi khinchataan ke rup main dekh rahi he
 He says that there is a double engine of development in Bihar, but both engines are pulling each other in the opposite direction
 vahiin, is maamle main bijepi cote ke path nirmaan mantri nand kishor yadav ne kuch bhi bolnaa munasib nahin samajha
 According to the Road Construction Department, a total of 82 road projects are included under the Prime Minister's special package, whose estimated cost is 54 thousand 700 crores

 keval chaar pariyojnaayen aisi he, jinamein jameen adhigrahan kaa kaam baaki he, jisko jald hi puraa kar liya jayega
 In the case, JDUK spokesperson Neeraj Kumar says that the state government is at the national level in the field of construction
 ham to kaam karne vaale log hai
 However, there are no plans of two lakh crore rupees, as Gadkari said
 jab bihar main bijepi or jediu kii sarkaar bani, to yah kaha gaya ki bihar main dabl ingine lag gaya he
 With the NDA government at the center and the NDA government here too, development will take place at double speed
 aisa bihar ke liye 28 varshon ke baad sanyog aayaa tha
 RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari says that there is a tussle between BJP and JDU inside
 pehle kaha ja rahaa tha ki bihar main vikaas kaa dabl ingine lag gaya he, lekin ab tak kya vikaas hua he? janata ke saath chhalaava ho rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar is doing pressure politics to increase his seat
 jis pradhanmantri ne patna vishvavidhyalay ko kendriya vishvavidhyalay kaa darja nahin diya, wo bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja kya denge

 in logon ne FIPB ko apruv kiya, uske baad vitt mantralay ne manjuuri di
 Kapil Sibal continued in the debate, a case was registered after 10 years
 chidambaram se sibiai ne abhi tak sirf ek baar poochtacha kii
 Chidambaram never ran away from questioning
 agar chidambaram sawaalon se batch rahe hai to sibiai un sari baton ko court main rakhe
 Kapil Sibal said before the court, 12 questions were asked to Chidambaram, out of which 6 have been answered by Chidambaram in the previous inquiry
 kal arest hone se lekar aaj 11 baje tak sibiai ne koi poochtacha nahin kii, jabaki chidambaram ne baar-baar poochtacha ke liye kaha
 This case is based on documents
 agar paisa mila he to wo kisi acount main gaya hoga, wo koun sa acount he, kisne paisa diya, kab diya? 5 million dollar kahaan par diya gaya? sibbal ne jaj se kaha ki cese diary main dekh lijie agar aisa kahin kuch likhaa he to
 Kapil Sibal said in the debate, the questions that were asked earlier are being asked again
 in logon ne ek baar poochtacha ke baad dubaara lambey samay tak poochtacha kyon nahi kii
 The anticipatory bail order was hung for 7 months
 keval aaropon ke aadhaar par remand nahin di ja sakati
 After this Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued on behalf of Chidambaram
 unhone kaha, jin 6 sachivon ne jo FIPB kaa faisla liya unhen arest karne kii koshish bhi nahin hui, kyonki wo public life main nahin he
 Indrani Mukherjee made a statement in court in February 2018, this lady (indrani Mukherjee) became a government witness in June 2019
 14 maheene tak poochtacha ke liye nahin bulaayaa gaya or ab ye giraftaar kar rahe he
 Is there any evidence to become a government witness? Can he be arrested on the basis of that? The judge asked, when was the summons issued to Chidambaram? Singhvi said, in June 2018
 aapako wo jawaab nahin mil rahaa jo aap sunanaa chaahate he
 Then the judge said, he will give whatever is the answer
 singhvi bole chidambaram wo jawaab nahin denge jo sibiai sunanaa chaahati he
 Singhvi further said in this debate, Mehta has sought remand but has not made any allegations against him
 ye bataaen aarope kya hai? is mukademe main sibiai kaa sara approach hi galat he
 No triple risk from Chidambaram, flight risk, to run away, to impress witnesses and to erase evidence
 ye castady dene ke laayak majboot cese nahin he
 There was also a heated argument between CBI lawyers Tushar Mehta, Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi regarding the remand
 6 june 2018 ke baad is cese main koi deveopment nahin hua
 CBI lawyer Tushar Mehta said again, those who know Chidambaram are not telling
 is par chidambaram ne kuch kehane kii koshish kii, lekin sibiai ke vakil ne roka
 Mehta said that 2 lawyers are already arguing in the court
 sibiai kii taraf se tushaar mehta ne kaha, gambhir frod kii jaanch main kisi nattejey tak pahunchane tak samay lagata he
 On 20 June 2018, new facts emerged
 iske turant baad chidambaram ko hoicourt se raahat mil gayi
 Even after arresting them, questions are still avoided
 hoicourt kaa bhi maananaa tha ki ye bel dene ke laayak nahin he
 We cannot reach the truth without custodial interrogation
 ham jaanch kii baaten public main nahin bataa sakate
 Chidambaram wanted to present his stand, but the CBI protested and said that this would be a wrong tradition
 chidambaram ne kaha, ''maine 6 june 2018 ko sibiai har sawaal kaa jabaab diyaor na hi mainen paisa liya
 i have given information of my son's account abroad to CBI
 meraa koi acount videsh main nahin he

 But when Baba Ramdev comes on the stage and takes a microphone to convey his message clearly to the non-hindi speaking people, with the temper of English, shout 'choose Modi' in pure Hindi, the camp is filled with enthusiastic public The applause resonates
 ve bheed ko bataate hai ki kalikat main vasco di gamma ke kadam padate hi desh main lut-khasot shuru ho gai thi
 In this way, he goes on targeting the nehru-gandhi family, "it should have stopped in 1947, but it continues till today
 ” ek aise rajya main jahaan bijepi kaa koi bhi vidhayak yaa saansad kabhi nahin chunaa gaya, unki aawaaj garajati he, ‘narendra modi ko dilli main bithaaen or desh kii khoi hui garima ko punerjeevit karen

" ve chunavi sangram ko 2014 kaa dharmayuddh bataa rahe hai or daawa karte hai ki modi ko pradhanmantri banane ke uddeshy se chalaaya gaya unka ‘ghar-ghar pahunche ramdev’ abhiyaan desh bhar main jor pakad rahaa he
 In this connection, Ramdev will visit 100 Lok Sabha constituencies of all major states before voting
 ve kehete hai, “main rojaanaa 500 se zyada gharon main jaaoongaa
 My workers present in 600 districts will visit 500 houses every day
 ”modi kii hi tarah ramdev ke bhaashan bhi aag ugalate hai or bheed mantrmugdh sunati he

 ve arthpurna andaaj main kehete hai, “is desh kaa fakir hi vajeer banegaa or takadir badalegaa
 "in his speeches, he calls the Third Front a" Jamaat that spreads state and economic chaos "

 "this entire exercise was not offered as a BJP sponsored event but as a special yoga session of Ramdev
 aayojan sthalon par bijepi kaa koi kaaryakarta nahin dikhaa
 He emphasizes his point, “I have decided that i do not want to use the BJP platform
 isliye aapako party kaa jhda nahin dikhegaa
 Here i have to interact with my people
 ”unhen bhi bhav-vibhor hone ke khub maukey milte hai

 Even before the BJP projected the Chief Minister of Gujarat as the top contender, Baba started the work of reinforcing the idea "modi becomes Prime Minister"
 unke mutabik, “bharat ko ek majboot, nirnaayak, sthir or anbhavi sarkaar kii jarurat he jo sirf modi hi de sakate hai
 "he also said that for this reason he does not want to waste his energy with Kejriwal's AAP
 “ab prayog karne kaa samay nahin
 You have failed in Delhi

 "they are using pamphlets to reach every house, which reads: 'voter hai bhag vidhata

 a week after Calicut's session, he held a yoga camp in Anand, Gujarat, where his speeches echoed the name of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, which certainly excited local sentiment: "the opportunity to establish Sardar Patel in Delhi was snatched away
" Because some sly Congressmen in favor of Nehru misled Mahatma Gandhi
 bharat ko isaki badi keemat chukaani padi
 Nehru came to power and the country was divided into three parts

 kanpur jone ke sabhi nau jilon main ab priventive pulising hogi iske liye google kaa sahaara liya ja rahaa he
 Under this, the details and history of the crimes committed in the last 10 years in all the police stations of each district will be recorded in Google and police pickets will be posted there after marking the areas where the maximum crime is committed so that the criminals cannot escape from the crime or else Before they commit the crime, the police should be killed
 google ke sahare priventive police seva kii shuruuaat kanpur jone ke nau jilo kanpur shahar, kannauj, kanpur dehaat, farrukhabad, jhaansi, lalitpur, mainpuri, jalon tathaa itawa ke sabhi 176 police steshnon main agle maah july ke pratham saptaah main shuru ho jaayengi
 For this, a program has been started to train one young policeman of each police station in this regard
 kanpur jone ke police mahanireekshak (aiji police) ashutosh pandey ne bhashaa se vishesh baatcheet main bataaya ki abhi tak hamaari police ‘reecting pulising’ karti he jisamen koi aparaadh yaa ghatana ho jane ke baad police maukey par pahunchati he or maamle kii jaanch padtaal kar aparaadhiyon tak pahunchati he
 But after Agra, we are going to introduce preventive policing in all the nine districts of Kanpur zone so that before the crime or after committing the crime, the offender is in the custody of the police
 pandey iske pehle agra main tainaat the or vahaan priventive pulising ke kaary kaa dekharekh kiya tha
 According to Pandey, under this, we have asked for the complete details of the places of highest crime from the police stations of all the districts

 Similarly, incidents of assault, robbery, theft, robbery, communal tension, in the last ten years, when and where have happened, all this must have been found in Google Map
 ab adhikari google map main jaakar password daalkar us jile kaa jab itihaas khangaalega to uski ek clic se saare jile main sarvaadhik aparaadh kii ghatnayen kahaan kahaan hoti he uskaa puraa vivaran uske computer screen par hoga
 He said that what was the crime in the data put on Google map, who had committed it, when was it committed and what is the status of that case in the present time, who will be the criminals and whether they were caught or are absconding
 
 kisi shahar kaa naam google map par daalane ke saath hi shahar main ilaake ke anusaar aparaadhon kaa vyora khud ba khud saamne aa jaayegaa or yah pataa chal jaayegaa ki kis ilaake main koun sa aparaadh zyada ho rahaa he
 IG Pandey told that then we will deploy police columns and pickets at the place where crime is going on so that before the crime, the offender comes under the police's arrest and if for any reason the crime is committed then the criminal will immediately arrest the police Come pandey ne bataaya ki agra main is priventive pulising vyavastha shuru karne ke baad se vahaan hone vaali sarvaadhik chaandi kii lut kii ghatnaon main kaaphi kami aa gayi thi kyonki hamane google map ke sahare vah sthaan chinhit kar liye the jahaan-jahaan sarvaadhik chaandi lut kii ghatnaaye hoti thim phir un sthanon par police tainaat kar di thi isse apradhi yaa to pehle hi pakad jate the yaa phir lut ke baad turant police ke hathe chadh jate the

 adhiktar log kisi shubh kaam ko shuru karne se pehle sankalp karte hai or ganesh ji ko yaad karte hai
 Some people write Sri Ganeshaaya Namah at the time of launching
 iske alaava yah rivaaj bhi he ki sabhi devi-devataaon se pehle shri ganesh kii puja kii jaati he
 Most people know about this custom, but very few people know why Ganeshji is worshiped first of all
 to aaie aapako bataate hai kyon kii jaati he ganesh ji kii sabase pehle puja
 
 
 Actually, there should not be any hindrance in any worship, worship, rituals and work, hence first Ganesha-worship is attained
 iske peeche puranic katha bhi he
 Once a dispute arose among all the gods on which god should be worshiped before all the gods on earth
 sabhi devtaa swayan ko hi sarvshereshth bataane lage
 Then Narada ji, seeing this situation, advised all the gods to go to the refuge of Lord Shiva and tell them the answer to this question
 jab sabhi devatabhagwan shivake sameep pahunche to unke madhya is jhagade ko dekhte hue bhagwaan shiv ne ise sulajhane kii ek yojana sochi
 He organized a competition
 sabhi devganon ko kaha gaya ki ve sabhi apane-apane vaahanon par baithkar is puure brahmand kaa chakkar lagaakar aaen
 In this competition, whoever revolves around the universe and reaches them, will be considered as the first worshiper
 sabhi devtaa apane-apane vaahanon ko lekar parikrama ke liye nikal pade
 Ganesh ji was also a part of this competition
 lekin, ganesh ji baaki devataaon kii tarah brahmand ke chakkar lagane kii jagah apane mata-pita shiv-parvati kii saat parikrama purna kar unke sammukh haath jodakar khadey ho gaye
 When all the gods returned after doing their own circumambulation, Lord Shiva declared Shri Ganesh victorious in the competition
 sabhi devtaa yah nirnay sunakar achambhit ho gaye or shiv bhagwaan se iskaa kaaran poochne lage
 Tabashivji told them that the parents have been given the highest position in all the universe and all the worlds, which are considered higher than the gods and all the creation
 tab sabhi devtaa,bhagwaan shivake is nirnay se sahamat hue
 Since then, Ganesh ji was first considered to be revered
 yahi kaaran he ki bhagwaan ganesh apane tej buddhible ke prayog ke kaaran devataaon main sarvapratham puuje jane lage
 Since then, Ganesh Vandan is considered auspicious before every auspicious event or festival
 ganesh ji kaa pujansabhi duhkhon ko dur karne vaala evam khushhaali laane vaala he
 Therefore, all devotees should worship Lord Jeeka with full devotion and faith before every auspicious work
 to is kaaran har shubh kaary kashri ganesh vighnanaashak ganesh jike pujan se hi hota he

 in vidhayakon ke aane se 82 sadasyeey jharkhand vidhansabha main bijepi ke 43 vidhayak ho gaye hai or use akele hi bahumat mil gaya he
 But with this exercise, the credibility and pride built in the wave of Narendra Modi has been discounted
 shaayad isi vajah se bijepi ke bade naamon ne is milan se kinaaraa karnaa hi behatar samajha
 At the same time, the image of Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das has been that of a rash leader to give honest and good governance
 lekin in vidhayakon ke aane se unki ginati bhi un sattalolup netaaon main hone lagi he jinhone satta hathiyaane ke liye gathjod tode hai

 Yet the BJP cannot escape the accusation that JVM President Babulal Marandi broke the party when it refused to merge
 vidhayakon par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai ki janata ne to unhen jeviem ke liye vot diya tha
 Das was not comfortable running a simple majority government on ajsu's strength
 so nae sahyogiyon ke liye unhone darwaja khol rakhaa tha
 Therefore, he had appointed only four cabinet ministers while taking oath
 mantrimandal main saat pad khaali hai par abhi tak uskaa vistaar nahin kiya gaya he
 When asked about this, Das brushed aside the saying, "the expansion will happen very soon
" ’’ ab mantrimandal vistaar jald ho saktaa he or in nae vidhayakon ko usamen jagah mil sakati he
 Jaiswal, who is being described as the leader of the party, may be one of them

 It is said that if this fast is kept with the entire law, then one gets a desired life partner
 karvaa chouth ke din mahilaayein din bhar nirjala vrath rakhti hai or raat main chand ko arghya(moon Sighting) dene ke baad pati ke haathon pani pikar apana upwas todatii hai

 vaise to kisi bhi vrath ke kuch aadharbhoot niyam hote hai, jaise ki krodh na karnaa, kisi kii buraai na karnaa, mukh se apshabd na nikaalnaa aadi
 In the same way this rule also applies on the fast of Karva Chauth
 agar aap vrath kar rahi hai tshapani indriyon par niyantran rakhen
 It is said that if anger is observed on this day, then the full effect of the fast is not obtained
 2
 Start the fast by eating a sargi
 sargi suryoday se pehle khaani chahie
 The moment you eat sargi, sit facing the southeast direction
 3
 Nirjala fast is observed throughout the day on Karva Chauth
 yani ki ann-jal ke alaava pani pine kii bhi manaahi hoti he
 Suhagin women break water fast after drinking water at the hands of husband after offering to Moon
 vahiin, kunvaari ladkiyaan taron ke darshan karne ke baad pani pi sakati hai
 By the way, pregnant and sick women should not observe Karva Chauth fast
 lekin kai garbhvatee mahilaayein fal or pani pikar bhi yah vrath kar sakati hai
 4
 karvaa chouth ke din mahilaayein solah shringaar karti hai
 On this day, colors of suhag such as red, yellow and green sarees, salwar suits and lehengas are most prevalent
 is din kaale or safed kapade pahanane se bachanaa chahie
 5
 karvaa chouth ke vrath ke din chand ko arghya dena behad jaruri or shubh mana gaya he
 On this day, women first place a lamp on a sieve
 iske baad chalni se pehle chand ko or phir pati ko dekhati hai
 After this, Argh is offered to the moon
 aakhir main mahilaayein pati ke haath se pani pikar or mithai khaakar apana vrath kholti hai

 Also, it is important for both the husband and wife to respect each other not only on the day of Karva Chauth, so that their relationship is always tied to the door of love

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Srinagar, "for the first time in 30 years, see the amazing of the Modi government, that the army, for the first time in a press conference, said that the youth who were killed was the army's fault
 inkvyri kamishan bithaaya gaya or jinhone goli chalaai, un par cese darj kiya gaya
 This is a proof of my noble intentions
 
 
 " The special thing is that PM said this during the election speech
 
 
 kisi band kamare yaa kisi press conference main nahin
 
 
 This was perhaps the first time that a prime minister had dragged the army into Kashmir's electoral politics
 sawaal uthta he ki mahaj chunavi phaayde ke liye pradhanmantri kaa sena kaa zikr karnaa kahaan tak sahi he
 
 
 The That too in a sensitive place like Kashmir
 
 
 agar yahaan pradhanmantri yah jatlana chaah rahe hon ki unke kehane par 30 saalon main pehali baar begunaahon kii hatya ko lekar maafee maangi gai, to vah galat hai
 Lieutenant General HS Panag, who was the first Army Commander of the Army in Jammu and Kashmir, says that even during his tenure in 2007-08, such mistakes were made, so he did not delay in apologizing to the people
 ab jabaki fouj kashmir main chunavi mudda ban chuki he to sawaal ye bhi uth rahe hai ki badgaam main hui do mauton ko lekar 20 din ke andar hi aanan-fanan jaanch kyon puri kar di gai, jabaki aisi jaanch puri hone main to do-teen maheene lag jate hai
 Moreover, during the election itself, why the decision to convict five soldiers came out in the Mosquito Encounter case
 in donon kii timming ko lekar charchaaen joro par hai, jo kai sawaal bhi khadey kar rahi hai
 Is the immediate action now motivated by such military action politics? 
 
 ? Major SS Pandey, a legal expert in military affairs, says that such an action in the army is silent and nobody discusses it outside, then why the news in this case is being politically colored, and how these news leaks She has been 
 
 ? Not only this, now the officers from the top to the bottom of the army will think 10 times before taking any action that their work is directly directed by the Prime Minister
 ho saktaa he, ve apana kaam pehle kii tarah eemaandaaree se nahin kar paae, kyonki pehle to ve sena ke kaayade or jamini halaat dekhakar faisla lete the, lekin ab to kuch or sochakar bhi faisla lenge, or iskaa nateeja kya hoga, iskaa pataa to vakt aane par hi chalegaa
 On social sites, however, there is a loud buzz that what happened in Uri is a result of the incumbent Northern Army Commander Lt Gen DS Hooda accepting the Army's mistake in the army action in Budgam
 kaha yah ja rahaa he ki jab aatanki uri kii santari post ke paas aae to jawan ko un par andeh to ho gaya tha, lekin us par sidhe fire nahin kar paae or isaki keemat sena ke aath javaanon ko apni jaan dekar chukaani padi
 Significantly, at that time in Budgam, the army said that people were stopped at two of its sentry posts, but they did not stop and fired at them, killing two people
 vaise jab sena ke logon se is bare main baat kii gai to unka kahana he ki narendra modi jammu-kashmir main keval bijepi ke netaa banakar hi nahin gaye the, balki usase pehle vah desh ke pradhanmantri hai
 Like everyone else, the army also has special expectations from them
 ummiden, na keval sena ke maan-sammaan ko phir behaal karne ko lekar hai, balki uske hausale ko bhi buland karnaa he, taaki vakt aane par sena har tarah kii chunauti kaa saamana kar sake
 But if the Prime Minister encourages such an army, then what is the result of that, needless to say
 suraksha ko lekar sarkaar kaa ravaiya kitna lachar he, iskaa andaaza is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he desh kii sabase badi paramilitary force siarpief abhi bhi mukhiya viheen he, yahi haalat pradhanmantri kii suraksha ke liye jimmedaar espiji kii bhi he

 Publicly, Kerala's Popular Front of India (PFI) describes itself as a champion of unity and equality
 saath hi dharm parivartan, hawala funding, jaanaleva hamale or aatankwaad se judaav ke aaropon ko lagaataar khaarij karata rahaa he
 But India Today's Special Investigative Team, in its investigation, has exposed the real face of this organization, which describes itself as charitable
 india today ke under cover reporters ne chupe camere par PFI ke sheersh padaadhikariyon ke munh se aise khulaase kaid kiye hai jo sakate main daal dene vaale hai
 Whether it is a mass conversion, illegal funding, or the ultimate goal of making India a predominantly Islamic country, all of them can be seen confessing themselves
 bataa den ki PFI pehle se hi rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) kii jaanch ke radar par he
 PFI is accused of brainwashing Hindu women and getting married to Muslim men
 haalanki PFI ke mahila daste kii pramukh jainba e
 s

 Zainba, citing those allegations, said that she 'prepares' non-muslim women for conversion

 That is, the case of marriage of Shafi'n Jahan, the Muslim youth of Hadiya

 The marriage was canceled by the state high court in May this year

 The appeals of Hadiya and Shafi Jahan are now pending before the Supreme Court
 jainba ne somvaar ko kaha, "maine hadiya se tabhi sampark kiya tha jab wo satya sarani (PFI kaa sahyogi sanghathan) main daakhile ke liye ai thi
 In fact, he converted to Islam two years ago
 2013 main usne islam apanaaya tha
 "zainaba insisted that this love is not an jihad but an arranged marriage
 lekin jainba ne is hiprophile cese ke liye somvaar ko khule taur par aaropon ko jaise khaarij kiya, usase pehle jainba ke munh se PFI ke kaale karnaamon ke khulaase ko india today ke under cover reporters chupe camere par kaid kar chuke the
 Zainba, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, was imprisoned on a hidden camera, saying how the PFI and its associate organization, Satya Sarani, have been involved in mass conversions in Manjeri, Kerala
 jainba ne kaha, "wo hamaara santhaan
 
 
 In the last 10 years, nearly 5,000 people have been converted to Islam
 " jainba ne mana in logon main hindu or isai donon shaamil hai
 Religion, which is considered an emotional issue in Kerala, is banned in Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha if it is done forcibly or by inducement
 haal main jharkhand vidhansabha ne bhi dharm parivartan virdohi bill paas kiya he
 Zainba, sitting with husband Ali at her home in Malappuram, openly told under-cover reporters how she had a role in converting some non-muslim women to Islam by converting to Islam
 haalanki pati-patni ne hadiya se jude maamle par alag se kuch nahin kaha
 Ali said, "we have a school teacher, msc in Maths and b

 "zainba revealed," her name before conversion was Shubha, now she is Fatima
 "under cover reporter- "kitne gaiyr muslimon kaa aapane dharm parivartan karaayaa?"jainba- "bahut hai"jainba ne dharm parivartan ke puure taur tareekon kaa bhi khulaasa kiya
 Zainaba said that the centers of conversion are run by wearing clothes of charitable or educational institutions so as to eliminate the possibility of any opposition
 jainba ne kaha, "hamen aadhikarik taur par ise dharm parivartan centre ghoshit karne kii jarurat nahin he
 It is an educational institution
 " jainba ne mana, "is sab ke liye bahut taiyaari kii jaati he, sansadhano kii jarurat hoti he
 We have to build trust first
 "jainba ne bataaya ki aise sikret centaron ko trust ke taur par registration ke liye kam se kam 15 sadasyon kii jarurat hoti he
 Elaborating further, Zainaba said, "later we choose the space for the campus of the center

 Since the Amritsar railway accident, the railway administration is constantly shying away from its responsibility
 ab railway ke daavon par sawalia nishaan lagane vaali ek or jaankaree saamne ai he
 In fact, while clarifying about the Amritsar train accident, the Railways had said that there is a rotation of the tracks at the place where the railway accident occurred due to DMU
 lihaaja dur se loko payalat nahin samaj paaya ki log patari par jamaa hai
 'aaj Tak' has got such information, which is not only contrary to the statement of the railway, but also questions its claims
 joda phatak se donon taraf jalandhar-amritsar rail trek ekadam sidhaa he or sabase badi baat yah he ki loko payalat kii najar sicks bai sicks hoti he
 In such a situation, the matter of not being able to see the people gathered on the track is surprising in itself
 jis jagah par yah haadasa hua, vahaan par joda phatak ke paas railway kii koi fensing nahin he
 However, there are high walls of the railway near the venue of Ravana Dahan
 yahaan par vijaydashami meley ke aayojakon ne mela ground ke saath-saath rail patariyon se lagi hui diwaar ke paar kii railway jameen par kharpatvaar or ped katkar logon ke baithne kii vyavastha kii thi
 Local people said that the LED was turned on the track, so that people could enjoy Ravana combustion
 jab yah puri vyavastha kii ja rahi thi, tab railway ke trek kii suraksha kii jimmedaari kaa jimmaa liye arpeef kahaan thi or unki intelligence unit kya kar rahi thi? jab yah kaarykram ho rahaa tha, tab railway ke adhikari or surakshakarmi kya soe hue the?ab railway yah daawa kar rahaa he ki trek par log anadhikrut rup se aa gaye the
 So it does not become a responsibility for him
 iske saath hi railway kaa yah bhi kahana he ki vijaydashami ke meley ke aayojan kii jagah bhi unke antargat nahin aati he
 Therefore, there was no need for permission from them
 railway board ke chairman ne kya kaha?bataa den ki shuukravaar ko amritsar main joda phatak ke paas dmyu trainravan dahanke liye ikattha hue saikadon logon kii bheed ko kuchalate hue nikal gai thi
 After this, the Ministry of Railways said that there is no fault of the loco pilot of the train and there is no need for CRS investigation
 railway board ke chairman aswani lohani ke mutabik is haadase main loko payalat kii koi galati nahin he
 Overall, the railways says that the place where this accident happened is not according to the railway law to gather people
 aisi kisi jagah par jab log ikattha honge, to use gaiyr kanoonee entry mana jaataa he
 He said that the Railway Safety Commission works under the administrative control of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and compulsory investigation of all railway accidents
 yah ek aisa haadasa tha, jisamen logon ne rail patari par anadhikrut pravesh kiya or yah koi rail durghatana nahin he
 What did the Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinhane say? Apart from this, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha said after visiting the site that it was evening at the time of the incident and the track was also curved, due to which the driver could not be seen further 
 jab unase train kii raftaar ke bare main poocha gaya, to unhone kaha tha ki trainen to speed se hi chalati hai
 On the question of taking action against the gateman, he said that the rail gate is 300 meters away from the place where the effigy of Ravana was being burnt
 maamle kii jaanch ke sawaal par sinha kaa kahana tha ki kis baat kii inkvyri ham karaaen
 
 
 The When asked if the driver could not stop the train in any way
 is par mantri ne kaha tha ki patari se 70 meter dur kaarykram ho rahaa tha, iske alaava vahaan halakaa mode bhi tha, to driver ko kaise dikhaai detaa?kaise hua haadasa?bataa den ki shuukravaar shaam ko amritsar ke chaudaa bazaar sthit joda phatak ke railway trek par log maujuud the
 The effigy was being lit just 200 feet away from the tracks
 isi dauraan jalandhar se amritsar ja rahi dmyu train vahaan se gujri or trek par maujuud logon ko kuchal diya
 After this, corpses were spread all around
 is haadase main 59 logon kii maut hui he, jabaki 57 log ghayal hai
 The speed of the train is about 100 km during the accident

 a senior TMC leader said, 'recently, TMC and CPM coordinated several issues in Rajya Sabha and worked together against the government
 pradhanmantri is ekta ko sansad ke bheetar bhi todna chaahate hai
 That is why the Prime Minister was attacking the CPM during the response to the President's address but he did not attack our party
 ' Bengal is very important for the BJP in view of next year's assembly elections
 abhi uske paas yahaan keval ek vidhayak he, lekin vah apni sankhya badhaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The BJP won two parliamentary seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and has a strong following
 udhar tiemasi ummid kar rahi he ki mamata banerjee pradhanmantri se mulaakaat main rajya ke hit main kuch na kuch raahat bator paaengi
 At the same time, the Prime Minister can try to blunt the attacks being made on himself politically
 lekin kya do lakh karod ke karz ko maaf karnaa centre sarkaar ke liye mumkin hoga
 Experts say that if the Central Government cannot give this relief to Bengal in any case, then in such a situation, Mamata that this meeting will write a new conflict

 ) loksabhaa chunaav 2019 kii siyaasi ladaai ab purvanchal pahunch gai he
 Everyone's eyes are on Varanasi, the parliamentary seat of PM Modi, on the other side, Azamgarh, the seat of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 akhilesh ke khilaaf bijepi ne bhojpuri film star dinesh laal yadav urf 'nirahua' ko chunavi maidan main utarkar mukaable ko dilachasp bana diya he
 In this situation, the entire political struggle of Azamgarh has been confined between the leader and actor of the Yadav community
 aise main bada sawaal yah he ki yadav or muslim sameekaran vaali is seat par akhilesh ke raajnneetik ganit ko nirahua apane filmi karishme se kya bigaad paaenge?purvanchal ke raajnneetik sameekaran ko saadhane ke liye akhilesh yadav uttar pradesh kii sabase sef seat maane jane vaali azamgarh se chunavi maidan main utre hai
 Although his father Mulayam Singh Yadav also landed in 2014, but he could not succeed on this plan
 is baar hathi ke sahare akhilesh purvanchal kii jang fatah karne ke liye azamgarh ko chunaa he
 Due to the alliance with the BSP, the political fizz here may be seen in favor of Akhilesh, but the way the crowd is gathering in Nirhua's rally and roadshow, if it turns into a vote, then the victory for SP here It will not be easy to fly
 bahari banaam kshetrickhilesh ko 'bahari' ummidavaar bataa rahe nirahua azamgarh ke logon kaa dil jeetna chaahate hai
 However, the people of the area report the electoral mood in favor of Akhilesh
 haalanki kuch kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki sapa adhyaksh ke liye ladaai utani aasaan bhi nahin he, jitani sochi ja rahi he
 Akhilesh Yadav was in Azamgarh after the nomination to rally with the BSP President on Wednesday
 jabaki nirahua lagaataar yahaan apni maujuudagi banaae hue hai
 The caste equation of Azamgarh makes the fort of SP stronger and this time the BSP is also with it
 aise main akhilesh yadav ke liye or bhi majboot najar aate hai
 Of the 19 lakh voters in Azamgarh seat, more than three and a half lakh Yadavs, more than three lakh Muslims and about three lakh Dalits
 yahaan ke jaateey ganit akhilesh kii raah ko aasaan or nirahua ke liye mushkil khadi kar saktaa he
 The most safe seat for Akhilesh Professor Digvijay Singh Rathore of Eastern University says that Azamgarh is the safest seat for Akhilesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, not Purvanchal
 yahaan ke jaateey or raajnneetik donon sameekaran akhilesh ke paksh main he, isi ke chalate yahaan se wo chunaav maidan main utre hai
 Of the 10 assembly seats in Azamgarh district, 9 are with the SP and BSP
 itani siten soobe ke kisi or jile main donon partiyon ke paas nahin he
 Not only this, Ramakant Yadav, who gave a tough fight to Mulayam Singh in the last election, is also contesting outside Azamgarh this time
 congress ne akhilesh ke saamne ummidavaar nahin utarkar yah raah or bhi aasaan kar di he
 Digvijay Singh says that in this Lok Sabha election, SP has kept distance from the upper caste community, due to which it is in favor of BJP
 lekin azamgarh main sapa sarkaar main bahut vikaas kaary hue hai, aise main savarna samudaay kaa bhi kuch vot unke paksh main ja saktaa he
 They say that the BJP could not win this seat in the Ram Mandir wave and Modi wave
 vah kehete hai ki bijepi ne is baar azamgarh ke bagal ke jile ke gajipur ke rahane vaale bhojpuri ke star nirahua ko maidan main utaara he, unke road sho main bheed ho rahi he, lekin yah bheed selfi lene vaali zyada dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, it is difficult to say whether it will vote
 vah kah rahe hai ki nirahua ke paksh main koi sakaaratmak parinaam tabhi aa saktaa he jab vah sapa ke kor voter yadavon main send lagaayenge
 Apart from this, due to his popularity, non-yadav Obosi, non-jatav Dalit and upper caste sections can stand with BJP, which can turn around here
 prachaar ke liye pahunch rahe piem modispa ke durg ko bhedane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi guuruuvaar ko azamgarh main nirahua ke paksh main jansabha ko sambodhit karenge
 He can definitely get some benefit from Modi Factor
 digvijay kehete hai ki azamgarh main vikaas kii kami, berogari, jile main kisi vishvavidhyalay kaa nahin hona or rashtrawaad aadi pramukh mudde hai
 There are all issues of farmers and traders here, which no party is giving importance to
 sabhi yahaan ke jaateey sameekaran ke sahare jeet kaa swaad chakhnaa chaahati hai
 yadav-muslim occupation for three decades Ajamgarh Lok Sabha seat has been occupied by Yadav and Muslim for the last three decades
 saal 1989 se abhi tak yadav or muslim ummidavaar hi azamgarh se jitkar sansad pahunchate rahe hai
 In 1989, the victory of Ram Krishna Yadav BSP started here and in 1991 Chandrajeet Yadav won from Janata Dal
 jabaki yah daur ram mandir andolan kaa tha, iske baavjood bijepi nahin jiti
 Ramakant Yadav won here as a SP candidate in the years 1996 and 1999
 vah varsh 2004 main basapa or 2009 main bijepi ke tikat par chunaav jite the
 bsp's Akbar Ahmed Dumpy won the by-elections in this seat in 1998 and 2008
