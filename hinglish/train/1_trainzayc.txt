 com / gyjpmdg8eavideo- Three divorce bills to be introduced in Rajya Sabha, not easy path for government pichley kuch varshon se sansad virodh kaa plateform banati ja rahi he
 When an issue is hot or there is a dispute, it falls on the Parliament
 vipaksh puri takat laga detaa he ki vah chalane na paae jaise ki sansad ke chalane se aasmaan tut padegaa or desh barbaad ho jayega
 The opposition, especially the BJP, created disruption on big issues like 2G scam, coal scam, and created chaos on small issues and did not let Parliament run
 ab telugana mudde par sansad nahin chal hi paa rahi he
 The Congress wants it to have a bill to partition Telangana, but it is so opposed that the House has to be canceled
 15veen loksabhaa ke jivan kaal ke ab kuch hi din shesh rah gaye hai or iskaa pradarshan ab tak chuni gai lok sabhaaon main sabase kharaab rahaa he
 It passed the fewest bills and has the least debate on important issues
 is satr main 39 bill soochibaddh hai jinamein se zyaadaatar kaa koi bhavishya nahin he
 That is, they will not be able to pass
 is satr main agar koi bill paas ho sakegaa to vah he lekhanudaan
 It is clear that this session is also going to offer uproar and noise
 telugana ke mudde ko agar congress bijepi ke saath baithkar sulajhaa bhi leti he to samay itnaa kam rah jayega ki kuch bhi sarjanaatmak kaary nahin ho paaegaa
 Even if some bills are passed, then there will be no scope for debate like they did in the last few sessions
 yah bhi ek shame kii baat hogi ki bina kisi bahes ke rashtriya mahatv ke bill paarit kara liye ja rahe hai
 There was a time when there was a huge debate in Parliament on bills, discussion of members' scholarship, their eloquence and a good message was sent to the public
 yah sansadeey loktantr kaa ek khubasurat pahalu he
 But for a few years now, Parliament is known for the chaos and noise
 vichaar manthan or sarjanaatmak baatcheet ke liye lagata he ki yahaan koi jagah nahin bachi he
 In this Parliament, there were hours of debate on many subjects, members used to prepare for weeks in advance and kept their points effectively
 lekin ab baat shorsharabe se aage nahin bad paati he
 Members also seem to have lost interest in it
 ve vakout karte hai or sadan main koi charchaa nahin hone dete
 It is different that later many members are seen hotly discussing the same topic on TV channels
 yah bhartiya loktantr ke liye khatre kii ghanti he
 The framers of the constitution would never have imagined that this important house would meet its fate
 ab vakt aa gaya he ki is bare main sochaa jaae ki iskaa keemtee vakt kaise barbaad hone se roka jaae
 Before this pillar of democracy falls, some concrete steps have to be taken
 lekhak varisht patrkaar or 'aaj tak' ke sampadakeey salaahkaar hai

 ahmedabad mahanagarapalika ke paas pichley teen saal se hit acshan plan he, yani garmeeyon ke dauraan logon ko kaise lu lagane se bachaaya ja sake uske liye acshan plan
 Ahmedabad is the only city in the country that has such an action plan
 is plan main ahmedabad mahanagarapalika ne indian institute of public health or america kii georgia tech university ke saath ek samjhauta kiya he jiske tahat georgia tech university roj ahmedabad kaa agle 7 dinon kaa taapmaana kii sambhaavna bataati he or uske mutabik ahmedabad mahanagarapalika shahar main apni taiyaari karata he
 Three types of alerts are issued under this plan
 pehla he yelo alert - jab shahar kaa taapmaana 40 se 43 degree ke bich honevaala ho, orenj alert - jab shahar kaa taapmaana 43 se 45 degree ke bich honevaala ho, red alert - jab taapmaana 45 degree se or badhanevaala ho
 When there is orange and red alert, then water can be arranged in the city, place hoardings for people in the summer, which knows how to deal with the heat, like drinking more water, buttermilk, not getting out in the afternoon , Exit and then stand in the shade every once in a while
 iske alaava aspataalon ko bhi khaas soochna di jaati he ki hit stroke yani lu lagane kii vajah se koi bimaar hokar aaye to uski kis tarah se dekhbhaal kii jaay
 Providing ORS solutions along with water at various places
 isi plan kii vajah se ahmedabad mahanagarapalika ko ek award bhi mila he
 The comments lekin jab shahar main isaki padtaal kii gai to ye puri taiyaari sirf kaagazon main hi pai gai
 If we went to big markets like the three gates of the city, there was no arrangement for drinking water, there was a provision, then the shopkeepers did it on their own so that their customers would not have trouble with the heat
 zyaadaatar hording itani garmi main bhi khaali mili jin par koi jaankaree denevaale hording nahin the
 People also showed complete lack of information about it
 isse lagata he ki puure desh main hit wave kii vajah se saikadon log mar rahe hai tab isse nipatane kii yojana hone ke baavjood thos amal na hone kii vajah se ahmedabad mahanagarapalika desh main ek role model nahin ban paa rahi he jisaki sakht jarurat he
 In this plan, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has entered into an agreement with the Indian Institute of Public Health and Georgia Tech University of America under which the Georgia Tech University daily predicts the temperature of Ahmedabad for the next 7 days and accordingly the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation would make its preparations in the city is

 The first is yellow alert - when the city temperature is between 40 and 43 degrees, Orange alert - when the city temperature is between 43 and 45 degrees, red alert - when the temperature is increasing by 45 degrees
 jab orenj or red alert ho tab shahar main jagah-jagah pani kaa intjaam karnaa, logon ke liye garmiyon main jagah-jagah hording lagaana jisamen garmi se kaise nipta jaay isaki jaankaree ho, masalan zyada pani pinaa, chacha pinaa, dopaher ko baahar na nikalnaa, baahar nikalen to har thodi der par chhaanv main khadey rahanaa vagairah
 Apart from this, special information is also given to the hospitals that how to take care of them if they are sick due to heat stroke
 jagah-jagah pani ke saath-saath oares ke ghol uplabdh karwaanaa
 Due to this plan, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has also received an award
 tippaniyan But when it was investigated in the city, all this preparation was found only on paper
 shahar ke teen darwaja jaise bade bazaaron main gayi to pine ke pani kaa koi injam nahin tha, intjaam tha to dukandaaron ne apane taur par kiya tha taaki unke graahakon ko garmi se pareshaani na ho
 Most of the hoardings were found empty even in such heat, on which there was no hoarding giving any information
 logon main bhi isaki jaankaree kaa puraa abhaav dikhaa
 It seems that hundreds of people are dying due to heat wave across the country, due to lack of concrete implementation despite plans to deal with it, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation is not able to become a role model in the country which is desperately needed

 It is understood that some former mps who appeared before the committee expressed their anger, saying that they are given first class tickets to travel on the train, but those accompanying them, even if their husband or wife
 Ho is given a second class ticket only
 samajha jaataa he ki samiti ne yah sifarish bhi kii he ki purv saansad or unke 'saath chalane vaale' ko pratham shrenee kaa tikat diya jaae

 The major airports of the country are named after eminent personalities
 jaise mumbai main chhatrapati shivaji maharaj internationalairportor dilli main indira gandhi international airport
 In early 2017, there was a report that the government is considering a proposal on the names of the airports, that the existing airports and future greenfield airports will be named after the cities and not in the name of the persons
 jin 6 airports ke naam badale gaye, in 5 shakhsiyaton ke naam par rakhe gaeiske peeche kaaran bataaya gaya ki yatriyon or videshi paryatakon ko hawaonddon ke naamon ko lekar asuvidha kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, kyonki wo un bhartiya shakhsiyaton se waakif nahin hote jin par hawaonddon kaa naam rakhaa gaya
 Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha said, 'the matter is under investigation
 ham dekh rahe hai ki kis tarah is mudde se acchhee tarah nipta ja sake'
 The language of the proposal to put the names of airports on cities was logical and progressive
 3 may 2016 ko sarkaar ne rajyasabha ko bataaya, ‘yatri or khaastaur par videshi paryatak ilaake ke sthaneey itihaas ke bare main zyada nahin jaanate, isliye unhen hone vaali asuvidha ko dekhte hue aisa najariya saamne aayaa he kihwaiaddonka naam usee shahar ke naam par rakhaa jaae, jahaan wo sthit hai yaa oparate kar rahe hai

 The information that we got is this - to change the name of the airport, the state assembly must first pass the resolution
 phir ye kendriya cabinet ke paas jaataa he or antat: ise bharat ke gajet main adhishuchet kiya jaataa he
 Out of 6 airports, 4 names have been changed by the UPA government and 2 by the NDA government
 In the last 10 years, the names of 6 airports have been changed
 inamen se 5 ke naam shakhsiyaton ke naamon par rakhe gaye hai
 As far as the sixth airport is concerned, the government decided to add 'maharaj' after Shivaji to Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport Mumbai

 The party also alleged that the BJP was responsible for the current situation in Kashmir which had an opportunistic alliance with the PDP

 Tiwari said that these big Turram Khans, who are sitting in the government, have not been able to get the by-election for the Lok Sabha seat of Anantnag till date
 aise main agar jammu-kashmir ke halaat bigade hai to uske liye sidhaa-sidhaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ji, unki sarkaar or pidipi ke saath avasarwaadi gathbandhan jimmedaar he
 In fact, Amit Shah had claimed in a public meeting on Thursday against the backdrop of the Pulwama terror attack that Jawaharlal Nehru was the father of the problem that Kashmir is causing terrorist incidents

 digvijay singh ne twit karke kaha ki navjot siddhu apane dost imran bhai ko samjhaaiye, uski vajah se hi aapako gaali pad rahi he
 Please tell that Pakistan's terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed was involved in the Pulwama terror attack
 jaish ne hi aatanki adil daar ko training di thi
 40 CRPF personnel were killed in this terrorist attack

 Digvijay Singh also told Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan that the Honorable Prime Minister Imran Khan dared to hand over terrorists Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar to India
 isse aap pakistan ko vittiya sankat se baahar nikaalane ke saath-saath nobel shanti puraskaar ke liye front ranor honge
 In fact, after the terror attack in Pulwama on Thursday, Congress leader and Punjab government minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had said that it is not right to hold the entire country responsible for such a dastardly terrorist attack
 aatankwaadiyon kaa kai deen or majahab nahin hota he
 There are good, bad people in the world

 jo bure hai, use sazaa di jaani chahie, lekin kisi bure insaan ke kaayartapurna kaam ke liye sabko dosha dena uchit nahin he

 input: bhashaa Sharad Pawar, who emerged as a Alexander after winning the defeat on the political turf of Maharashtra, once again proved that experience cannot be underestimated compared to intelligence
 itihaas main unhen na keval apane kile ko surakshit rakhane balki bijepi or shivasena kii 30 saal puraani dosti main send lagane ke liye bhi yaad kiya jayega
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi once praised Pawar, saying that he used to consult the NCP leader to learn the tricks of politics
 raajnneetik panditon ko yah baat ab shishe kii tarah spasht ho gayi ki modi kyon pavaar ke raajaneetak kaushal ke prashansak hai
 The top leadership of the Congress was not ready to go with the party that was holding the legacy of Bala Saheb Thackeray after the BJP did not give Shiv Sena the chief minister's post
 kintu pavaar ne ek sadhe hue raajnneetijna kii tarah iske liye congress netritv ko manaaya or shivasena ke saath haath milaane ko taiyaar kar liya
 Although nephew Ajit Pawar was sworn in overnight as the Deputy Chief Minister in Devendra Fadnavis's government, once it was felt that Sharad Pawar, the lion of Maharashtra's politics, has now defaulted
 lekin agle hi daanv main pavaar ne na keval bijepi balki saare raajnneetik vishleshkon ko chaaron khaane chitt kar diya
 Before the Maharashtra Assembly elections, the BJP through its campaigning force tried to prove that it was returning with a strong majority in the state
 yahaan tak ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne fadanvis ko chunaav prachaar ke dauraan pradesh kaa aglaa mukhyamantri ghoshit kar diya
 But without being affected by this glare of publicity, the 78-year-old Pawar continued his campaign by going from village to village and almost every constituency
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan satara kii ek chunavi jansabha main pavaar kii ek tasviir rashtriya surkhi bani thi jisamen barasate pani main unhone apana bhaashan jari rakhaa tha
 In the same public meeting, Pawar said that this rain is "god's grace"
 satara vidhansabha seat se is baar ensipi ke shrinivas patil ne bijepi pratyaashee or shivaji maharaj ke vanshaj udayan raaje bhonsle ko haraaya tha
 Pawar was the face of the congress-ncp alliance in the assembly elections
 is baat ko bijepi acchhee tarah jaanati thi or isi liye chunaav prachaar ke dauraan modi, shah sahit adhiktar netaaon ke praharon ke nishane par pavaar hi the
 But Pawar won the NCP success in 54 seats in the state by his efficient campaigning and choosing the right candidate for his party
 pavaar maharashtra kii raajnneeti main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale shakkar sahakaari sanghon main bhi gahari paith rakhte hai
 He became an MLA from Baramati at the age of just 27 and became the youngest Chief Minister of Maharashtra at the age of 38 only ten years later
 vah kul teen baar maharashtra ke mukhyamantri bane hai
 The events of Pawar becoming Chief Minister for the first time are nothing short of an interesting story
 apatkaal ke baad hue chunaav main congress maharashtra main kai siton par haar gayi
 After this, Chief Minister of the state Shankar Rao Chavan resigned from his post taking moral responsibility for the defeat
 vasantdada patil unki jagah maharashtra ke mukhyamantri bane
 Later the Congress broke up and the party split into Congress (U) and Congress (I)
 pavaar ke guru yashavanth raav or pavaar congress (you) main shaamil ho gaye
 Assembly elections were held in Maharashtra in 1978 and both factions of Congress contested separately
 baad main janata party ko satta se dur rakhane ke liye congress ke donon dhadon ne ek saath milakar sarkaar banaai
 Vasantdada Patil remains the Chief Minister
 is sarkaar main sharad pavaar udyog or shram mantri bane
 It is said that in July 1978, Sharad Pawar separated himself from the Congress (U) at the behest of his mentor and formed a coalition government with the Janata Party
 baad main yashavanth raav patil bhi sharad pavaar kii party main shaamil ho gaye
 In February 1980, the government of the Progressive Democratic Front led by Pawar collapsed after Indira Gandhi returned to power
 1999 main unke raajaneetak jivan ne ek badi karavat lee
 Due to Sonia Gandhi being of foreign origin, she had to split from the Congress and form the Nationalist Congress Party, to protest against her being made Congress President
 kintu pavaar kii raajnneeti main gahari paith ke kaaran congress ko lagaataar teen baar maharashtra main unki party se gathbandhan kar sarkaar bananaa padaa
 After the removal of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, when the UPA government was formed in 2004, Pawar was made the Minister of Agriculture
 haalanki isse pehle bhi vah 1990 ke dashak main raksha mantralay kaa prabhaar sambhaal chuke the
 Later in 2009 also he became the Minister of Agriculture at the Center
 pavaar ne 2012 main ghoshnaa kii thi ki vah ab loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 But fighting elections does not mean retiring from active politics
 pavaar ne maharashtra ghatnakram main dikhaa diya ki unki rajya kii raajnneeti par ab bhi vahi pakad he jo aaj se chaar dashak pehle hua karti thi
 The issue of bringing back the Kohinoor diamond from Britain was discussed in a meeting between External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma on Friday
 ek sutara ne bataaya ki yah baithak 45 minute se adhik der tak chali or 108 carat ke is heere se jude muddon ke bare main charchaa hui
 The diamond is currently displayed in the Rajmukut displayed at the Tower of London
 april main sarkaar ne ucchtam nyaayalay main kaha tha ki hira ko british na to jabardasti le gaye or na hi unhone use churaayaa, balki ise punjab ke shaskaon dwaara east india company ko uphaar ke rup main diya gaya
 There are many legal and technical hurdles in bringing this diamond as it is of pre-independence period and thus it does not come under the purview of the Antiquities and Art Estates Act, 1972
 haalanki fatkaar sunne ke baad sarkaar ne kaha tha ki is heere ko waapas laane kii sabhi koshish kii jaaegi
 It is estimated to cost $ 2 million

 ilzaam, apane hi sautele bhai ke katl kaa
 That too on foreign land and in a very mysterious way
 malaysia ke biji airport ke andar taanashaah ke sautele bhai par jis tarah do ladakiyon ne jahrile spray or sui se hamalaa kiya vaisaa sirf filmon or kahaniyon main hi dekhne sunne ko miltaa he
 International Airport of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia
 airport ke vatting lounj par apni flite kaa intazaar karte tamaam logon ke saath maujuud darmyaani umr kaa ek shaks
 Meanwhile, two women suddenly appear
 palak jhapakate in mahilaon kaa is ek shaks ke upar hamalaa or agle hi pal donon kaa bheed main gaayab ho janaa
 As mysterious as the CCTV pictures are, the more complex the story behind it
 kya koi saikadon logon ke bich yun kisi ke chehre par zaharila spray chhidak kar yaa phir use sui ghonp kar maut ke ghat utaar saktaa he? or wo bhi itani jaldi or aasaani se? in sawaalon par aapkaa jawaab chaahe jo bhi ho, lekin haqiqat yahi he ki is hamale ke chand minuton ke andar hi ye shaks apni jaan se gaya
 With this, a big debate started around the world about this most talked about political murder
 kai mulkon ke bich tanaav ke halaat paidaa ho gaye
 Do you know why? Because, this murder was not of any ordinary person, but of Kim Jong Un, the half-brother of the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un
 ji haa, kim jong un yani uttar korea kaa sanakee or sirphira taanashaah, jisane ab tak apane kai rishtedaaron samet namaaloom kitnon ko maut ke ghat utarava diya or kitnon ko ab bhi barbaad karne kii dhamkee de rahaa he
 The manner in which his half-brother, Kim Jong, has been killed, is very intriguing in itself
 darasal, kim jong un kaa sautela bhai kim jong naam pichley kai saalon se apane mulk se dur china ke macau main ek nirvasit jivan ji rahaa he
 On Tuesday, the killers also took away his life
 is rose wo kwalalampur se macau ke liye apane flite kaa intazaar hi kar rahaa tha ki tabhi uske chehre par spray atake kar diya
 During this time, she was also pierced with poisonous needles, but before anyone could understand anything, the two women went missing in the crowd
 is hamale se badahavaas kim jong naam ne vahaan maujuud police or airport staff se shikaayat kar hamale kii jaankaree di or foran hi unhen medical aid yani chikitsakeey madad bhi dilaai gai
 But, sadly, he lost his life within the next few minutes
 soochna milte hi police pahunchi or sisitivi footage khangala
 On his basis, the police not only identified the two women, but also arrested them
 unheen kii nishandehi par police ne do or logon ko bhi pakadaa, jabaki is saazish main shaamil chaar or north korean log kwalalampur se flite pakad kar bhaagane main kaamyaab rahe
 But the way a person belonging to North Korea's royal family was killed, the people of North Korea came to know that behind it
 duniya ye maan kar chal rahi he ki is qatl ke peeche koi or nahin balki north korea ke taanashaah kim jong un kaa hi haath he
 By the way, there are many reasons for this doubt of the world
 ek to kim jong un pehle bhi apane kai rishtedaaron va dushmano kii jaan le chukaa he, doosraa kim se uske rishte bhi achche nahin rahe hai
 This is the reason that the name was forced to live an outcast life in Macau away from his own country
 iske baad bhi uski jaan lee gai

 Jethmalani said that i do not believe that what the girl is saying in her statement is correct and all men are lying

 Jethmalani said, 'what should i say on this issue
 jaj or ladki ke bich jab ye vakya hua, to main to vahaan maujuud tha nahin

 jab tak aarope lagane vaale se sawaal-jawaab na hon, chizon par yakeen nahin kiya ja saktaa

 According to income tax documents, the mystery of the National Herald is that where Rs 90 crore went? According to the documents, the Income Tax Department has accused the Congress Party, Associate Journals Limited and Young Indians of not cooperating in this matter
 saath hi report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki congress adhyakshasonia gandhi or rahul gandhibhi jaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahe hai

 peeth ne kaha ki agar vah tab bhi santusht nahin hoti he to company uske baad court kaa darwaja khatkhata sakati he
 Sensing the mood of the bench, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the firm, withdrew the petition

 The Gandhi family denied the allegations
 The lawyer of the Income Tax Department opposed the petition

 com / at7aderqhz jammu-kashmir main pichley kareeb saadhe teen saal se chal rahi bijepi-pidipi gathbandhan sarkaar gir gai he
 While BJP has sought support for Governor's rule by withdrawing support from Mehbooba Mufti government, Mehbooba has also sent her resignation to the Governor without delay
 yun to jab is gathbandhan kaa elaan hua tha tabhi se raajnneetik halkon main ise sabase bemail or lanbaa na chalane vaala qaraar diya ja rahaa tha lekin loksabhaa chunaav se thik ek saal pehle bijepi ne jis jatke ke saath samarthan vaapasi kaa elaan kiya he use uske mishan 2019 ke liye masterstroke or majaburi donon mana ja rahaa he
 In 2014, when the BJP came to power with a strong majority under the leadership of Narendra Modi, its biggest reason after the corruption of UPA was the failure of the Manmohan government on Kashmir
 modi sarkaar ke chaar saal or gathbandhan sarkaar ke teen saal puure hone ke baad bhi kashmir aaj vahiin khadaa he jahaan may 2014 se pehle tha
 Some experts claim that the situation is worse
 ise padhein: BJP se brallep par boleen mahabuuba- bade vijan ke saath kiya tha gathbandhanaise main bijepi 2019 main jab phir se vot maangane janata ke bich jaaegi to use jawaab dena baari pad saktaa he
 Keeping this in mind, the Modi government is believed to want to take a tough stance in the remaining term to crush terrorism in Kashmir and weaken the separatist tensions and may consider such steps while remaining a partner in the state power
 Were not possible for him
 2016 main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bhaajapa sabase bade dal ke taur par ubharkar saamne ai thi lekin raajnneetik majaburi ke chalate jab bhaajapa ko duusare nabanr kii party pidipi ko mukhyamantri pad dena padaa to puraa desh aashcharyachakit rah gaya
 The BJP then claimed that it was its attempt to make peace in Jammu and Kashmir through development
 beete teen saal main shanti kaayam karne kii koshishon kaa kya hua uskaa nateeja sabake saamne he
 The biggest question facing the BJP at this time is to win the 2019 elections more than running the government in Kashmir
 mishan 2019 ke liye jaruri he ki modi sarkaar kii chhavi aatankwaad se kisi keemat par samjhauta na karne or dashakon se desh ke saamne chunauti banakar khadi samasyaon par nirnaayak faisla lene vaale kii bani rahe
 The situation in Kashmir poses the biggest threat to this image
 ise padhein: top sikret tha kashmir par shah kaa plan, mantriyon tak ko nahin lagi bhanak!bijepi mahasachiv ram madhav kii pressvarta main bhi party ne yahi sandesh dene kii koshish kii ki kashmir main halaat behad kharaab to hai lekin uske liye wo nahin balki pidipi or uski mukhiya rajya kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti jimmedaar hai
 In the coming days, she will raise this matter more prominently and if she manages to change the situation in Kashmir to some extent, then her compulsion to sacrifice the government will turn into a masterstroke for 2019

 The decision to impose emergency in the country is the biggest stain in the history of Indian politics on the tenure of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

 iske baad congress ke samarthan se choudhary charan singh pradhanmantri bane
 After the demise of Indira's witchcraft party in 1980, the Congress led by Indira Gandhi again won the victory flag in the 1980 Lok Sabha elections
 indira ko apatkaal ke baad jo jhatka laga tha, usase kahin zyada jansamarthan unhen is chunaav main hasil hua
 The Congress won 353 Lok Sabha seats in this election with 43 percent of the vote
 jabaki janata party or janata party secular 31 or 41 siton par hi simat gayi

 Apply perfume on the wrist and leave it as is
 isse khushboo lambey samay tak tiki rahati he

 Premium charges apply !! uttar pradesh main bhaajapa kii vishaal jeet ke mahaan kshan main pradhanmantri narendra modi bahut aage kii soch rahe the
 The 2019 general election was not on his mind
 ve agali peedi ke bare main soch rahe the
 The day after the BJP came to power in four of the five states, the next day, Modi told his enthusiastic supporters at the party headquarters in Delhi, "I can see the election results of five states as the foundation of the new India
" i am seeing - a new India which will be India of 65% youth and conscious women groups below 35 years
 ek aisa nayaa bharat jahaan garib aadmi kuch maangane kii bajaae kuch karne ke avasar kii raah dekh rahaa hoga
 "not to be seen as a slogan of his next election campaign, he further clarified," i do not live by electoral mathematics
 meraa lakshya 2022 he, 2019 nahin, 2022 main bharat kii aazaadee ke 75 saal puure ho jaaenge
 We have just five years left to contribute to change India
 "jo log modi ke kareeb rahakar kaam kar chuke hai, ve kehete hai ki unke kahe kaa ek matlab hi nahin hota balki ve vahi karte hai, jo unki manshaa hoti he
 He is one of the few leaders of the world who are the masters of social media, so they say and do most of the things on their website
 usee din pradhanmantri kii website par ek nayaa ap aplod hua jisamen logon se sankalp lene ko kaha gaya jis par spasht rup se martin luther king junior ke ''aai haev e dream" (meraa ek sapana he) vaale mashhoor bhaashan kii chaaya thi
 In that app, people have been called upon to be a part of the new India that will be strengthened by "the power of all and every man of India, an India that will be driven by innovation, will move forward with hard work and creativity, an India Where there will be peace, unity and brotherhood and which will be free from corruption, terrorism, black money and filth
 " yah sab kuch 2022 tak kiya janaa he jab bharat aazaadee ke 75 saal puure karegaa
 If you press the button "take the Pledge" (take a pledge) on this app, it takes you to a page whose hashtag is Eamunindia and the following resolutions are written on it, which is to be ticked and corruption-free
 Standing in India's favor, working towards clean India, promoting cashless transactions, ensuring a drug-free India, encouraging women-led development, Riti and conservation of natural resources, support to people with disabilities, with peace, to work for unity and harmony and employment generator to be rather than job seekers
 unke aalochak aise daavon ko yah kahkar khaarij karte hai ki modi ek baar phir logon ko sapane bech rahe hai or yah mahaj jubaani jamaa kharch he jiske sahare ve ''achche dinon" ke vaade ko 2022 tak dhakel rahe hai
 However, even the most bitter critics will admit that Modi has emerged as a dominant figure on India's political scene, so whatever resolution he takes, it has to be taken seriously
 haal ke varshon main kuch hi netaa rahe hai jinhen modi jaisi baari chunavi kamyaabi mili ho—2014 main vishaal bahumat paane ke baad desh ke sabase zyada aabaadi vaale rajya uttar pradesh main apane kaarykaal ke bichobich ek dhamaakedaar vijay hasil karnaa marke kii baat he
 Though he was addressing a large section of the public, it remained in his mind that the electoral success of Uttar Pradesh demanded that he would have to pay attention to the new challenges arising from it
 unki jeet kii badhai dene vaale aalaa naukarshahon ko modi ne holi ke agle din kaha, ''hamaari vachanabaddhata ab or badi ho gai he kyonki uttar pradesh or uttarakhand shreshth prashasit rajyon main nahin aate hai
 We have to make a difference and it is a challenge for all
 " pradhanmantri is baat se paryaapt avgat the ki logon kii badhati aakankshaon ke maddenjar unhen desh bhar main pradarshan karnaa hoga
 As one official said, "according to all the announcements made so far, our agenda is quite broad
 is par thik se amal karnaa hoga
 The recent electoral victory will enable us to do so with more commitment
 "modi ko achche se jaanane vaale bataate hai ki maharashtra or odisha ke sthaneey chunaavon main mili jeet ke baad bhi unki pratikriya aisi hi shant thi
 He had allegedly told a colleague, "all my emphasis and determination is on the development of this country and not on such electoral victories
" " ek bade adhikari bataate hai ki aisa nahin he ki vidhansabha chunaav main mili jeet ke bahaane pradhanmantri aarthik sudhaar ke kuch saahasik faisle lene vaale hai
 He said, "for them, improvement is an everyday process
" lekin vidhansabha chunaav, khaskar uttar pradesh main mili jeet ne unhen aashwast kar diya he ki ve sahi raste par hai
 Now they are 100 percent convinced that they have to stand up for the rights of the poor
 "jinhen is baat kii chintaa he ki modi ab achaanak madhyamaarg se vampanth kii ore jhuk sakate hai or loklubhaavanavaad main funs sakate hai, unka bhay bhi niraadhaar ho saktaa he
 The blueprint for the new India that Modi has spoken about is still to be revealed, but there is a clear understanding that the Prime Minister is now moving away from the culture of subsidies and revisions
 yahi unke apanaae jane vaale nae sudhaaron kaa sabase pusht sanket he
 Apart from this, asking youths to create employment instead of seeking employment is another sign
 ve chaahate hai ki yah desh sarkari naukariyon par nirbharta vaali samskruti se dur hate or ve jati tathaa samudaayon par aadhaarit aarakshan kii vyavastha ko samaapt karne kii ore baduya chaah rahe hai
 In his victory address, Modi had said, "the poor of this country have now given up the mentality of liking leaders who give them something
" isaki bajaae garib aadmi kathor mehnat se tarakkee karnaa chaah rahaa he
 He is saying create opportunities for me, i will make him grow up by working hard
 "party ke kaaryakartaaon or afasaron ke saath apane samvaad ke dauraan modi pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay kii kahi ek baat ko ginvaanaa nahin bhoolatey
 The BJP is celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of Upadhyay, an RSS leader
 upaadhyaay ek udhaaharan dete the ki agar koi vyakti jise tairaaki na aati ho, kuen main gir jaae, to santvanaa ke shabd kisi kaam ke nahin honge
 Instead someone has to pull it out
 isaki ek shart yah he ki kuen main gira vyakti khud ko bachaane ke liye khub jaan lagaae
 Make full use of your power
 modi maanate hai ki sarkaar kii bhoomika niraashaa ke kuen main duubate hue garib aadmi ko sahaara dekar baahar nikaalane tak he lekin aisa karne main sarkaar ko yah bhi sunishchit karnaa hoga ki jis vyakti kii madad kii ja rahi he, vah puri tarah nirbhar hone kii bajaae khud apni madad ke liye mehnat kar rahaa he yaa nahin
 Initially, to ensure that subsidies and concessions are reaching the right people, the Prime Minister has resorted to a trio of Jan dhan-aadhar-mobile
 jandhan ke tahat khole gaye 25 karod bank khaaton, biomitric pahchaan or mobile phone ke madhyam se pradhanmantri ne garibon ko di jane vaali sabsidi or laabhon ke maamle main ek choti si kranti kii he
 The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system has ensured that the subsidy is sent directly to the beneficiary's bank account so that it can eliminate leakage and corruption
 debiti ke tahat ab tak 84 yojanaon or kaaryakramon main 32 karod se zyada labhaarthiyon ko dedh lakh karod ru
 The amount has been transferred more than Rs
 iskaa sabase jwalanth udhaaharan desh main alpiji silinderon kaa vitaran he
 There were about 1
5 crore people who heard and obeyed the Prime Minister's appeal to give up subsidies
 isse apane aap 1,800 karod ru
 Annual savings of Rs
 iske baad debiti pranali ke tahat sarkaar ne 3
 4 crore fake connections were eliminated, leading to huge savings
 pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana ke tahat sarkaar ne garibi rekha se neeche jeene vaale dedh karod pariwaron ko gas conection die, jisamen instolation kii laagat maaf kii gai or pehla silinder mukrat diya gaya
 a large number of BPL families in Uttar Pradesh benefited from this, due to which most women voted for the BJP in the elections
 modi kaa 2022 tak nae bharat kaa sapana is baat par tikaa he ki unhone 100 se zyada jo yojanaayen lagu kii hai unamem ve kaisaa pradarshan karte hai
 NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant says that Modi has started focusing on the results rather than the inputs and outputs
 pradhanmantri har timahi niti ayog kii baithak kii adhyakshata karte hai, jahaan ve sabhi yojanaon kii samiksha karte hai or jahaan kahin kami hoti he, vahaan samaadhaan bhi sujhaate hai
 Amitabh Kant says, "apart from his vast vision, his ability to constantly innovate and his will to take tough decisions takes him into small details and he talks of using technology to make a leap in development
" 
 "iske baavjood modi ko agar sabase zyada kisi ne jhatka diya he to vah naukarshahi he, saath hi cabinet ke kuch log hai
 Now Modi will have to take help of high level professionals for big programs
 upie sarkaar ne aadhaar card ke kriyanvayan ke liye nandan nilekani ko rakhaa tha or us kaarykram kii kamyaabi saamne he
 Modi should keep the vision of his new India in front and set concrete goals of implementation
 isse zyada ahm haalanki yah sawaal he ki in yojanaon se kitne rojgaar paidaa honge, taaki berogari kaa sankat khatm ho jisane swasth vruddhi dar ke baavjood arthvyavastha par asar daalaa he
 Leading economist Rajiv Kumar says that the Prime Minister should remove three shortcomings
 is suchi main sabase upar haalia kendriya bajet main darj kifayati awaas muhaiyaa karaane par diya jane vaala jor he
 For this, the Center will have to speed up the bidding process with private and government operators, reduce costs and ensure quality construction
 yah lakshya mahatvakankshi he kyonki 2019 tak 10 karod kifayati makaan banaae jane kaa lakshya he
 If even half of it can be completed, then it will generate huge number of jobs and people will get satisfaction of getting roof over their heads, that is different
 rajeev kumaar bahubrands ritel main pratyaksh videshi nivesh kii bhi himaayat karte hai, jo rojgaron ko badha saktaa he
 Their third recipe is to improve the sluggish investment climate and encourage production
 iske liye pradhanmantri ko sarkari bainkon ke enpie se nibatna hoga
 Modi has not invested capital in these banks so far due to financial losses and he also worries that doing so will save the obese
 amitabh kaant maanate hai ki mudra yojana, jisane ab tak 2 karod se zyada chote udhyamiyon ko saste karj dilwane kaa kaam kiya he, gramin or anaupchaarik kshetron ko protsaahan degi or rojgaar paidaa karegi
 The center is also emphasizing on labor intensive sector textile
 yahaan usne bade sudhaaron kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Modi will also have to deal with the growing crisis of farmers
 desh ko bhrashtachar se mukt karaane ke kaam main modi ko kaaphi saraahna mili he
 It seems that they have been able to overcome the problem of demonetisation easily, despite that the poor people had to face a lot of problems and the economy was also hurt
 garibon ne modi main apni aasthaa jataai he, to aisa isliye he kyonki ve maanate hai ki aakhirkaar amiron ko apane kiye kaa parinaam bhugatna padaa he
 In his remaining tenure, Modi will have to detect suspicious financial transactions using Big Data analytics and decide not to generate huge amounts of fresh black money
 unhen aisa karte vakt yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki is kaam main lagaae gaye kar adhikariyon ko kar aatank failaane kii chhot na milane paae
 Of course, after some time they will also have to calculate the real benefits of demonetisation, from which the government seems to be left
 shanti, ekta or sadbhaavna kii modi kii pukaar prashansaneey he
 So far, Modi has not fallen in the loop of the Hindutva agenda of the temple, the Uniform Code of Conduct and the abolition of Article 370
 isaki bajaae unhone vikaas ke muddon par khud ko kendrit rakhaa he jiske aadhaar par unhone 2014 kaa chunaav jeeta tha
 He has learned his work quite fast
 jab unke upar rahul gandhi ne ''sootboot kii sarkaar" chalaane kaa aarope lagaaya tha, tab unhone kaaphi teji se garib ''hitaishi or kisaan-hitaishiya chhavi akhriyaar kar lee, jisase congress or vamadalon kii jameen hi maano chhin gai
 Then he took away his corruption issue from the Aam Aadmi Party by demonetisation
 aisa karte vakt unhone ek vyapak saamaajik prayog ko bhi anjaam diya, jisane vyapak garibon ko alpsankhyak amiron ke khilaaf khadaa kar diya
 Modi's call to create a new India is being seen as a clever bet to turn young people and women towards themselves, so that by 2019, they can widen their social base
 haal hi main unhone jo chunavi kamyaabiyaan hasil kii hai, uske chalate vishleshkon ne unki tulana indira gandhi or jawaharlal nehru se kerani shuru kar di he
 The question arises that where does Modi stand today in the pantheon of Indian leaders? Political analyst Yogendra Yadav believes that Modi has decided that the BJP has become the most powerful party in national politics
 taqatvar se unka matlab he vaidhata ke saath mili takat—aaj modi ke paas lokapriy janadesh kii barbar takat he
 In terms of leadership, Yadav says that Modi is now ready to replace Indira Gandhi
 pradhanmantri ne apane hisse kii kahani ko dhang se bechaa he or logon ko is baat se raji kar liya he ki ve rashtriya hit ke saath khadey hai or un tuchchi ladaaiyon se kaaphi upar hai, jinamein duusari partiyaan uljhi padi hai
 Shakti Sinha, director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, who was the personal secretary to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, believes that Modi is not a status quoist but a transformational figure
 vaajapeyi se ulat modi prashasan par tej pakad main yakeen rakhte hai
 In terms of vision, Sinha believes that Modi is closer to Nehru than Indira
 nehru ne agar aadhunik bharat kaa sapana dekha tha to chunavi kamyaabiyon se labarej modi nae bharat kaa apana sapana saamne rakh rahe hai
 They are keeping pace with an ambitious country and making themselves more and more acceptable
 modi jati or samudaay kii rudhipoon ko bhi todgaye kii koshish kar rahe hai or netaaon ke chayan ke maamle main ve kade faisle lene ke icchhuk hai
 Despite his Punjabi origin, he made Manohar Lal Khattar the Chief Minister of Haryana
 maratha changul se bachate hue unhone devendra fadavis ko maharashtra kaa mukhyamantri bana diya
 He made Raghubar Das, a non-tribal leader, the Chief Minister of Jharkhand
 baavjood iske aresas ke saath modi ke rishte sahaj hai—takreeban ek saajheedaari ke jaisaa rishta he jisamen ve yah sunishchit karte hai ki unke faislon ko sangh kaat na sake
 His critics say that Modi is still tied to the philosophy of Hindutva at its core and warns that he will implement it when the right time comes
 jab vibhaajankaree sampradayik mudde ubharate hai, us vakt ve modi kii chuppi kii ore ishaara karte hai
 He also fears that too much power will make Modi a dictator
 to, kya modi bharat ke nae doordarshee netaa ke rup main ubhar rahe hai jo nehru or indira kii tarah varshon is desh par raaj karte rahenge yaa phir ve aage bhi dhokhaa dete rahenge? harvard ke manovaigyanik harvard gardenar ne apni prasiddh kitaab leading mindsah ain anatomi of leadership main likhaa he ki netaa un kahaniyon se khud ko jodate hai, jo kisi samaaj kii jivan kii samaj ke centre main hoti hai
 a successful narrative, Gardner says, depends on "whether the leader's own actions and life reflect the narrative of that story
" " uske baad ve netaa kii kamyaabi ke centre main paanch gun ginate haih kisi kahani ko gadhakar use aashwastakaari dhang se sunaane kii kshamta; khud kii jindagi main us kahani ko utaarne kii kshamta; apane shrotaaon kii gahari samaj; ek sahyogaatmak sanghathan nirmit karne or banaae rakhane ke liye jaruri urja; or lagaataar takneekee visheshgyata kaa dohan karne ke liye jaruri kaushal
 Modi has all these qualities and more than that
 unhone 2014 main badi safalataa se ek aakhyaan gadha ki ve hi hai jo is desh ko aarthik badahaali se nikaal sakate hai
 He sold a three-time chief minister in Gujarat as a model of development
 unki apni jindagi ek chaiwale se maamuli shuruyaat kaa udhaaharan thi, jiske baad unhone parivaar chhod diya or aresas ke santhnik kaamon ke prati khud ko samarpit kar diya
 Since then, he has displayed tremendous energy and has used technology competently in his work (he continued to do this at his election rallies, remember his own 3D hologram)
 gardenar teen kism ke netaaon kii baat karte hai jahaan aise gun nirantar paae jate haih drushtaa, nawachaari or saamaanya
 Ordinary leaders are those who rarely challenge the status quo and remain contented by empowering their members so that progress can continue
 ve nawachaari netaaon ke bare main kehete hai ki ye aise netaa hai jo kisi puraane aakhyaan ko uthaakar use nayaa mode dete hai or uske sahare samaaj ko badalte hai
 In contrast, sight leaders are rare
 gardenar ke mutabik, drushtaa vah he jo ''kisi maujuuda aakhyaan se khud ko jodgaye yaa haalia or sudur ateet ke kisi puraane aakhyaan main nai jaan foonkane se santusht nahin hota
 This person actually creates a new narrative, which many people are not already familiar with, and he achieves partial success in communicating this story
 "is kasuti par dekhen to modi ne vaaki apana ek aakhyaan gadha he or ve ek drushtaa kahalaane kii dahalij par khadey najar aate hai
 Despite this, it will be confirmed by the people of India only when they win the 2019 election with a huge majority
 vipaksh agar aisa nahin chahta he to use kaaphi gahare paithna hoga or pataa karnaa hoga ki modi ne jo yojanaayen shuru kii hai, unke pradarshan kaa asli haal kya he
 Only a critical and factual review of Modi's performance can hurt his credibility
 chunaav jeetne ke liye jati or sampradayik herpher par vakt kharch karne se kahin zyada jaruri yah kaam he
 If he has to remove Modi, he will have to bring out a specific narrative of his development and people will have to instill faith in him
 philhal to modi ko roak paanaa naammumkin he
 Narendra Modi gave many mantras for the overall development of the country in India Today Conclave
 lekin modi ke in mantron ko congress ne ek sire se khaarij kar diya he saath hi unpar nishaanaa bhi saadhaa he
 Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed tweeted, 'modi is absolutely right, he first created' Aftas' like 2002 Gujarat riots, fake encounters and then turned it into an 'opportunity' for electoral gains
 vaaki main yah ek kala he
 'it is worth mentioning that Narendra Modi had said in India Today Conclave on Saturday that we need to convert the disaster into opportunity

 Speaking at the India Today Conclave East 2018 held in Kolkata, Salim said, "the Left had no problem celebrating these festivals like Ramnavmi or Janmashtami, Eid or Bakrid
 mamata banerjee ke aane se pehle bhi ye hota aa rahaa tha
 Ramnavami was being celebrated even before the incarnation of Modi ji
 "saansad saleem ne kaha ki religen to thik he, lekin dharmik tyohaar, tithi, diwas inkaa istemaal raajnneetik golbandi ke liye karnaa ye kaaphi aapattijanak he
 Be it Mamata Banerjee Kapuja Utsav or her Tipu Sultan with the Imam of the mosque

 He said that in India 200-300 years ago neither the Ram Navami procession was carried out nor the Muharram processions came out
 19veen sadi ke ant main jab bharat main rashtrawaad kaa ubhaar ho rahaa tha tab angrejon ne gundon or kattarpathiyon ko paise die auradharmako sadakon-galiyon par laa diya gaya
 Mohammad Salim said that as a result, most of the riots took place during the Muharram procession in the next 100 years and it started with the Muharram procession in Kanpur, because Hindus were opposing it

 For the first time, Togadia was seen in front of the media staring at the fear of his encounter
 togadiya kaa ye rup unki ab tak media or janata ke bich bani chhavi se pratikul he
 Togadia is best known for his inflammatory speeches and spewing fire against the minorities, but today when he came in front of the media, he was neither targeted by the minority nor his arch rival Congress
 balki togadiya ishaaron-ishaaron main apni hi centre sarkaar se apane encounter kaa dar bataate najar aae
 Togadia has been associated with the RSS since childhood and is a surgeon who also runs his own hospital

 The work and studies of the Sangh continued simultaneously

 He has also established Dhanwantari Hospital in Ahmedabad
 doctor praveen togadiya ko kattar hinduvadi netaa mana jaataa he
 He is often in the news for his inflammatory statements
 vaajapeyi sarkaar main apane trishul diksha kaarykram ke liye togadiya kaaphi vivaadon main rahe the
 At that time, the government should be with anyone in Gujarat, but Togadia used to be a big force there
 togadiya ke rutabe kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki apane bayanon or kaaryakramon ke chalate ve vaajapeyi sarkaar ke liye bhi mushkilen khadi kiya karte the
 However, after Narendra Modi became Chief Minister in Gujarat, his status declined and today he is said to have been marginalized
 aaj jis tarah pressvarta main togadiya bhavuk dikhe isamen unke isi dard ko dekha ja rahaa he

 Supreme Court ruled to conduct floor test till 5 pm on 27 November
 Floor test: The Supreme Court has given its decision to conduct floor test on the Maharashtra case on Tuesday
 floor test kal yani 27 november ko shaam 5 baje tak karaayaa janaa he
 The special thing is that the Protem Speaker will administer the oath to all the mlas and then get the floor test done
 protem spikar ko sabhi partiyaan apane vip kii jaankaree bhi dengi
 Now the question arises as to who will become the Protem Speaker
 parampara ke anusaar, sadan ke varishthatam sadsy ko protem spikar niyukt kiya jaataa he
 The most frequently elected legislator is made a pro tem speaker, whom the governor nominates
 ab aise main sawaal uthta he ki protem spikar banane main parampara ko follow kiya jayega yaa nahin
 6 names suggested 6 names have been sent to Governor Bhagat Singh Kosari on the basis of seniority in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly
 inamen congress ke balasaheb thoraat pehle or bijepi ke kalidaas kalamkaar ke naam bhi duusare sthaan par he
 Apart from these two leaders, the names of KC Padvi of Congress, Hitendra Thakur of Bahujan Vikas Agadi Party, former speaker and NCP Neti Dilip Valse Patil and Babban Pachaput of BJP have been sent to the Governor
 haalanki balasaheb thoraat ko congress ne vidhayak dal kaa netaa chun liya he, is lihaaj se unke protem spikar banane kii sambhaavna kam hi he
 a similar situation was created in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly in 2018 last year
 tab rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne bijepi netaa keji bopaiya ko protem spikar chun liya jabaki sadan main congress ke aarvi deshpand sabase anbhavi vidhayak the
 5 important steps Wednesday is going to be very important for the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly
 supreme court ke aadesh ke baad kal sadan main 5 ahm kaam hone hai
 The first step will be the election of a pro-tem speaker
 doosraa kadam- protem spikar ko rajyapal shapath dilaayenge
 Third step - The Protem Speaker will administer the oath to the newly elected mlas
 chauthaa kadam- floor test ke liye sadan main voting karai jaaegi
 Fifth step - The pro tem speaker will announce the results of voting
 koun hota he protem spicrprotem spikar main protem (pro-tem) shabd latin bhashaa ke shabd pro tempor (pro Tempore) kaa sankshipt rup he
 The meaning of this word is - 'for some time
 ' vidhansabha main protem spikar kii niyukti rajyapal karata he or isaki niyukti tab tak ke liye hoti he jab tak vidhansabha apana sthaayividhansabha adhyaksh (spikar)nahin chun leti
 The Protem Speaker administered the oath to the newly elected mlas and the entire process of oath taking is administered by them
 sadan main jab tak vidhayak shapath nahin le lete, tab tak unako sadan kaa hissaa nahin mana jaataa
 Therefore, the legislators are first administered the oath
 jab vidhayakon kii shapath ho jaati he to uske baad ye log vidhansabha spikar kaa chunaav karte hai
 As per parliamentary tradition, the Governor selects one of the senior-most members in the House for a Protem Speaker
 yahi vyavastha vidhansabha ke alaava loksabhaa ke liye hoti he
 The Aam Aadmi is not taking the name of the fierce battle within the party
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki party kii 28 march ko hone vaali rashtriya parishad kii baithak main yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko parishad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 It is said that the names of the two are going to be proposed by Arvind Kejriwal himself, while it will be decided after voting
 jaankaree ke mutabik, is dauraan party ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejavaril baithak kii adhyakshata nahin karte hue adhyaksh pad ke liye kumaar vishwaas ke naam kaa prastaav rakhenge
 While Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan will be shown the way out of the National Council
 gauratlab he ki is baithak main dilli ke kai vidhayak shaamil honge, lekin isamen se baithak ke dauraan voting kaa adhikaar sirf 6 vidhayakon ke hi paas he
 Earlier on March 4, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan were shown the way out of the party's PAC amid allegations of conspiring to remove Arvind Kejriwal from the post of national convenor

 sisitivi footage main manoj do mahilaon samet chaar logon ke saath rajendra nagar ke sagar ratna restaurant main baitha he
 Where an Inspector and a sub-inspector of the Special Cell enter at 8:15 pm

 a sudden stampede ensues in the restaurant
 hathapayee ke bich pehle sab-inspector neeche girtaa he, phir manoj girtaa he
 Of course CCTV does not have pictures of firing, but it is so clear that the police tried to catch Manoj first

 The photographs suggest that Manoj had a weapon in his right hand, which the police wanted to capture, but all this happened within a few seconds and Manoj was killed
 bataur cricketer imran khan apane bekhauf andaaj ke liye saraahe jate rahe hai
 He became one of the greatest all-rounders of this game, not only for his willingness to take risks, but also because he won the seemingly impossible victory while being the captain of the Pakistan team
 1992 ke vishwa cap main unki team kamjor maani ja rahi thi or ek shuruaati match main bharat se haar kaa apmaan bhi jhel chuki thi
 But despite a shoulder injury, Imran roared and took the team to the famous victory
 vah ab tak kaa iklauta mauka rahaa jab pakistan vishwa cap vijeta bana
 The lesson is that Imran Khan should never be underestimated
 jin logon ne aisa kiya, unhen baari keemat chukaani padi
 Nawaz Sharif did the same in his third term as Prime Minister of Pakistan, the same Asif Ali Zardari had also done as President
 donon ne pakistani cricket ke poster-boy ko behad ahamkaari manamaujee tareeke se samajaseva karne vaala mana or pakistan kii uthal-puthal vaali raajnneeti main haashie kaa khilaadi samaj kar khaarij kar diya
 Today, both of Pakistan's most prominent families — the Sharif and Bhutto dynasties — are deeply involved in corruption charges and have reached political exile
 vahiin imran islamabad ke constitutional avenue main pradhanmantri awaas or daftar main jame hue hai
 When he took charge of Pakistan in August this year, Team Modi made a similar mistake
 usne imran ko mote taur par taqatvar pakistani fouj kii mahaj kathputli mana, jisaki door rawalpindi ke faujee hukmaranon ke mukhyalay main hogi
 (maybe it was right there
 ) usne yah bhi mana ki nae pradhanmantri desh kii khastahal aarthik halaat se post ho jaaenge or unhen suraksha or videsh niti ke maamalon main fouj kaa hukum maananaa padegaa (yah bhi sahi tha
 ) There is no sign of the Pakistani army disengaging from its old stand, so India continued its old stand with the new government that unless there is any progress in curbing terrorist activities, there will be no dialogue
 (yah nasamajhi thi, kyonki aisi niti ab kisi atake record kii tarah bajati lagati he or yah pahchaanane se inkaar karti he ki bharat ko pakistan main ab ek nai sarkaar se pesh aana he
 ) Prime Minister Narendra Modi took care to keep the door open by congratulating Imran on the victory
 imran ne kaha ki ve rishte sudhaarney ke liye "bharat ke har ek kadam ke badale do kadam aage baxey ko taiyaar hai to modi ne unhen likhaa ki bharat "sarthak or rachanaatmak pahal'' ke jariye donon ke bich achche padosi jaise rishte kaayam karne ko patibaddh he
 That statement was considered good in international light
 team imran ne bhi use is baat kaa sanket mana ki modi sarkaar 2016 se rukii padi baatcheet kii prakriya ko aage badhaane ko taiyaar he
 Even the ball was in India's court
 uske baad gafalton kii shuruyaat hui
 Team Modi's ears cropped up as soon as he came to know that former Punjab cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu has accepted the invitation to attend Imran's swearing in Islamabad in August
 siddhu ko vahaan agali qatari main jagah di gai or pakistan ke army chif javed bajva unase gale bhi mili
 Sidhu revealed that in the conversation, the general assured him that he would make the visa visa-free by building a corridor from the Kartarpur Gurdwara to the border of India
 vahaan se lautne par siddhu ko bajva se gale milane par bhaajapa or apni party congress se bhi aalochana jhelni padi
 But India's foreign ministry and intelligence agencies took Bajwa's offer seriously
 ve iske vakt or amal karne kii raftaar se thodaa dagamagaae jarur
 Pakistan realized that opening the way to the Kartarpur Gurdwara would not only gain the sympathy of the Sikhs on both sides of the border, but would also send a good message among the immigrants abroad
 aazaadee ke baad se hi seemaa ke donon taraf ke har dharm ke log maang karte rahe hai ki unhen us pavitra sthal tak jane kii ijaajat mili, jahaan pahunchnaa bantwaare ke baad se mushkil ho gaya
 In 1947, the governments of both countries signed an agreement to allow pilgrims to visit the shrine at special festive occasions
 bharat ke sikhon ke liye punjab main do gurudware-nankana sahib (guru nanak kaa janmasthan) or panja sahib ko is fehrist main rakhaa gaya lekin kartarpur ko nahin (jahaan guru nanak ne apane aakhri 18 saal gujaarey the)
 Kartarpur has also been raised in bilateral talks since 1999 with other places of worship, but Pakistan has been saying that the people of that place should also be allowed to visit the same places
 isi par baat atak gai
 India was also skeptical of this new Pakistan offer, as there is a lot of evidence from our intelligence agencies that Pakistan's intelligence agency, Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), has been behind the head of Khalistani extremism in recent years
 it is hand
 punjab ko swatantra khalistaan banane kii maang karne vaale guton ko pakistan ke gurdwaron main aavjaahi kii khuli ijaajat he or ve vahaan pahunchane vaale shraddhaluon ko bhi is makasad ke liye prerit karte hai
 Indian officials accuse the ISI of being instrumental in fomenting the New York-based Sikh for Justice (SFJ) faction
 yah gut duniya bhar main sikh naujavaanon ko kattar banane ke abhiyaan main juta he
 SFJ is running a campaign of Sikhs in 2020 to build Khalistan
 or to or bharat ke sena pramukh bipin ravat bhi apane haalia press conference main punjab main aatanki guton kii vaapasi kii chetavanee de chuke hai
 This warning was justified because immediately after that on November 18, Nirankari Samagam near Amritsar was attacked by grenades in which three people were killed
 punjab police kaa daawa he ki uske paas hatyaron ke seemaa paar se nirdesh milane ke saboot hai
 The Intelligence Branch of Punjab Police has foiled various 17 modules of Khalistani terrorists and arrested 83 militants since March 2017
 bharat kii chintaa yah thi ki pakistan kashmir ke alaava punjab main bhi phir ugravad ko hawa dene kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The Indian team was just now anticipating the intentions of the Pakistani army in Punjab that Imran wrote a letter to Modi in September that he would go to Kashmir (which he describes as the core issue of Pakistan with India) and terrorism (which is a concern of India's concern Is) ready to take further steps on all the hanging issues
 unhone sujhaayaa ki unke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi sanyukt raashtra aam sabha kii baithak ke dauraan videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj se milakar "aage kii raahya tay kar sakate hai
 Our Foreign Ministry spokesman announced that India had accepted the invitation, but it was rejected a day later
 iske liye jammu-kashmir main bhartiya suraksha balon kii "nirmam hatya'' or pakistan ke un aatankwaadiyon ke sakvamaan main dak tikat jari karne kaa hawala diya gaya, jinhone bharat par hamale kiye the
 The Foreign Ministry's statement came in a very sarcastic manner, "pakistan's nefarious agenda has been revealed and the real face of Pakistan's new Prime Minister Imran Khan has been revealed to the world
" ''haalanki mote taur par bharat kii pehle baatcheet manjuur karne or phir fouran khaarij kar dene kii vajahon ko vaazib or susangat nahin mana gaya
 a day before the invitation to negotiate was cleared, a strangled body of a Border Security Force (BSF) jawan was found on the international border
 nai ghatana sirf yah thi ki jammu-kashmir ke teen pulisavaalon ko agava karke maar diya gaya tha
 But all this has been going on in recent times
 phir, raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne bhi bhartiya sena ko pakistani fouj ke sir kalam karne jaise bayaan dekar uttejnaa badhaai thi
 So, why should the current incidents have resulted in the breakdown of talks? The postage stamp was also issued before Imran came to power in July, so why was it discussed now? Officials in Pakistan point out that fundamentalist elements of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the RSS have been involved in rejecting the talks
 imran ne twit karke modi par hamalaa bolaa, "maine apni puri jindagi main bade padon par boune logon ko baithe dekha he, jinke paas badi tasviir dekhne kaa najariya nahin hota
 "when it seemed that india-pakistan relations have come back to the same cross, Team Imran again called India
" pakistan videsh karyaalay ne bharat ke videsh mantralay ko khabar di ki uski sarkaar kartarpur gurdvare ke liye seemaa tak corndor banane kaa aupchaarik shilanyas kaarykram 28 november ko karne ja rahi he, jisase bhartiya shraddhaluon ko bina vija gurdvare tak pahunchane kii chhot hasil ho jaaegi
 He also said that the corridor will be built by the 550th Prakash Utsav of Guru Nanak in November 2019
 sase bharat sarkaar ke haath ke tote ud gaye, use is pahal kaa swaagat karnaa padaa
 Reacting negatively to this would have seemed disinterested and hurt the sentiments of the Sikhs
 modi ne badppan dikhaane kaa rukh apanaaya
 At an event on Guru Nanak's festival of light on November 23, the Prime Minister said, "who thought that the walls of Berlin would be demolished? With the blessings of Guru Nanak Dev ji, perhaps the Kartarpur corridor becomes a way to connect people by not just being a corridor
" 
 ''phir kya tha, pakistan ko peeche chhodie ke liye tabadatod kaarykram yojit kiya gaya, 26 november ko bharat kii taraf ke corndor kii aadharshila up-raashtrapati venkaiya naidu ke haathon rakhi gai
 It seemed a strange opportunity to raise its hand towards Pakistan on the 10th anniversary of the Mumbai attack, while the neighboring country did nothing to punish its conspirators
 kaarykram main manch par bhi rajya akali dal or congress ke netaaon ke bich ashobhaneey jhadap dikhi
 In contrast, Pakistan left no stone unturned to make the Kartarpur program a success and sent its invitation to top Indian leaders
 sushamaa swaraj ne inkaar kar diya magar kaha ki bharat kii taraf se do kendriya mantri harsimrat cor badal or hardip singh puri (donon sikh) kaarykram main bhejne kii baat kahi gai
 Keeping in mind the recent Amritsar attack, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also adopted the same attitude and said that i will not cross the border until Pakistan ends terror and violence
 haalanki ve siddhu ko nahin jane ke liye manaane main safal nahin ho paae
 Pakistan also invited diplomats from 40 countries to participate in the program
 videshi or bhartiya patrkaar (is lekhak samet) ko bhi bulaava bheja gaya
 General Bajwa also reached there during the foundation stone to show full support of the Pakistani army to this program, and soon after that he turned away
 kaarykram thodaa saamaanya-sa tha
 Especially because religion has been causing division in this subcontinent, the same is now being used to connect
 is pahal ko samarthan dene ke liye imran samet sabhi ne siddhu kii peeth thoki lekin harsimrat ke bhaashan ne logon ke dil ko chhu liya
 He said passionately that being a Sikh, the opportunity to visit this gurdwara is unmatched
 unhone kaha, "baba nanak ji ke naam par yah pahal, nai shuruyaat ho sakati he jinaki amritvani he, "naa koi hindu, naa koi musalmaan, lekin ek onkaar
 Later, when Imran took over the mic, he told the Kartarpur corridor the path of peace and gave reasons why it could prove to be decisive in india-pakistan relations
 unhone ek aisa fasaana guntha jis par team modi ko gaur karnaa chahie, basharte vah pehle hi na kar chuki ho
 Imran's argument is simple and simple with a new generation, who is not afraid of partition
 unhone kaha ki donon desh parmaanu shakti se las hai isliye jang main utarana "baari bevakoofi'' hogi kyonki koi jitegaa nahin, sirf jo batch jayega, vahi sametanaa hoga
 He further said that India and Pakistan should sit together and resolve their differences because there are big issues like poverty and economic progress which both can resolve with regional cooperation
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kashmir jaise masalon kaa hal baatcheet ke jariye nikaalnaa hoga
 India was enraged that the issue of Kashmir was raised in Imran in Kartarpur's speech, but one of the reasons for this was that Imran did not talk about overcoming terror which is the main concern of India
 imran ne vahaan pahunche bhartiya patrakaron ke saath press conference main jarur kuch sudhaar kiya
 This writer asked him what he could do to address the concerns of India? On this, Imran claimed that it is not in the right of Pakistan to instigate terrorists because his country is itself a victim of terrorism
 unhone kaha ki peshawar ke skool par bhayanak hamale ke baad aatankwaadi guton par dabish ke liye 2015 main banaae gaye rashtriya acshan plan par puri raajnneetik sahmati he or samvidhan main aise sanshodhan kiye gaye hai jisase faujee adaalat main aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf jaldi sunwaayee ho
 He also said that the military, political and judicial establishment are unanimous in this matter
 unhone bhartiya niti-nirmaataaon ke "nazariye'' main badlaav kaa bhi aahvaan kiya or kuch halke andaaj main kaha ki bharat main chunavi mausam chal rahaa he, isliye agar bharat chaahe to ham uske agle aam chunaavon tak intjaar karne ko taiyaar hai
 His big message for PM Modi is this: Try me first and see if you fail
 bhartiya adhikariyon ke paas unke bhaashan ko lekar shaq-shubahaa paalane kii vaazib vajahen thim
 It was emphasized that issues such as overcoming terrorism need more action than talk
 unka kahana he ki imran ke pehle navaj sharif sahit kai pradhanmantri aise hi vaade kar chuke hai lekin kisi bhi morche par kuch kar dikhaane main ve naakaam rahe hai
 Despite this, some Indian experts say that the Kartarpur corridor is indeed a big initiative and it was time for examination to take the lead in the battle of preparing public opinion
 donon taraf ke punjab main kartarpur corndor ko bantwaare ke baad shanti kii pehali badi pahal mana ja rahaa he
 This fruit was ripe for the last 25 years, if not 70 years, and Imran took the army along and broke it
 yakeenan, kuch khatas ke pal bhi the, jisase pakistan aasaani se batch saktaa tha
 For example, General Bajwa is joined in Kartarpur by Gopal Singh Chawla, whom India considers a Khalistani extremist
 pakistani adhikariyon ne fouran safai pesh kii ki chawla pakistan kii shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti (esajipisi) ke secretary general hai, jo desh main sabhi gurudwaron kii dekharekh karti he, is naate unki maujuudagi vaazib thi
 Chawla claims that he is not a fugitive as he is not an accused in any extremist or terrorist case in India
 baad main kuraishi apni jabaan kaabo nahin rah sake or kah gaye ki imran ne kartarpur kii "gugali'' main bharat ko fansaa liya
 Sushma Swaraj described this statement as evidence of Pakistan not being serious
 phir bhi, yah saaf he ki bharat kartarpur maamle main pichad gaya
 This was a chance for Team Modi to change the game to deal with Pakistan
 abhi tak narendra modi pakistan ke khilaaf aage badhkar khelte rahe hai
 In 2014, when he took power, he took important initiative by inviting Nawaz Sharif in his swearing-in
 lekin uske baad ve rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kii salaah par pakistan ke khilaaf "aakraamak bachaav'' kii niti par aage bad gaye
 Part of this policy was the famous surgical strike across the border in September 2016, which was termed as a revenge for an attack on an army camp in Uri, Kashmir, ten days earlier
 pakistan main isko lekar ek anischitata kaa maahaul bana ki bharat use dandit karne ke liye kis seemaa tak ja saktaa he
 In his Independence Day address the same year, the Prime Minister also mentioned Baloch nationalism and said that the people there have sought help from India
 iske aath maheene pehle, disambar 2015 main modi protocol todakar sharif kii potee kii shaadi main shirkat karne lahore pahunch gaye the
 This gave them a valid reason to say that they were ready to move out of the box to establish peace with Pakistan, but Pakistan has only committed infidelity by carrying out terrorist attacks
 is bich, pradhanmantri modi ne sanyukt arab emirate (yuai), saudi arab, iran or madhya asia ke kuch islamic deshon ke saath rishte majboot karke pakistan ko antarrashtriya manch par alag-thalag karne kii koshish kii
 In the US, with his friendship with both Presidents of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, Modi could also pressurize Pakistan to overcome terror
 ek had tak bharat kii koshishon se pakistan aatanki vitt poshan par kaabo paane main naakaami ke liye vaishvik mani londering nigaraanee sanstha, financial acshan task force (efeetief) kii chetavanee suchi main aa gaya he
 Nevertheless, Pakistan moved its cards cleverly
 jab use laga ki america kaa dabaav baari pad rahaa he, to vah puri tarah china kii ore jhuk gaya
 During Sharif's tenure, with the support of the army, Pakistan signed the china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CEPC)
 china infrastracchar pariyojnaon par 62 arab dollar nivesh karne ko taiyaar ho gaya
 Under this, there are projects to build rail, road, power plants and ports in the entire area of pakistan from Pakistan occupied Kashmir to Balochistan
 isse china ko guadar bandargah se arab sagar ke marfat apane vyapaar ko raftaar dene main madad milegi
 On meeting with China, Pakistan was able to stop India's initiative to declare jaish-e-muhammad chief Masood Azhar as an international terrorist
 iske alaava parmaanu aapurti samooh main bharat kii sadsyta bhi is tark par pachade main funs gai ki pakistan bhi iskaa hakdaar he
 It is a different matter that between Sharif and Bajwa, there was a chill in the matter of command of CPEC
 fouj is par ad gai ki isaki suraksha kii jimmedaari uske tahat rahegi
 Bajwa is said to have helped Imran Khan in the recent general elections to get rid of Sharif
 abhi tak suraksha or videsh maamalon main fouj kii line hi aage badhaakar imran ne is ehsaan ko chukaaya he
 Being with the political government, the army has moved forward from Afghanistan to negotiate with the US
 yahaan tak ki "chota-motaa bhi kuch na karne'' ke liye pakistan se kaaphi khafa trump bhi kuch naram pad gaye hai or afghanistan main sulah kii sarkaar sthapit karne ke liye baatcheet ke paksh main aa gaye hai, jisamen udaar taliban netaa bhi shaamil hai
 However, it is not the case that all trump cards are in the hands of Pakistan
 imran khan ne agast main jab bagdor sanbhali, unhen viraasat main jarjar arthvyavastha mili thi
 Pakistan is badly immersed in both internal and external debts and its fiscal deficit has gone above six per cent
 pakistani rupye kii keemat bhartiya rupye ke mukaable takreeban aadhi he
 His foreign exchange reserves can barely pay a month's worth of imports
 is janjaal se khud ko nikaalane ke liye use takreeban 25 arab dollar kii jarurat he
 Imran's first mission was to take a begging bowl to Saudi Arabia and China for financial help
 saudi arab ne 6 arab dollar kii peshkash kii, par china ne abhi tak raham nahin kiya he
 He instead increased the pressure on him, saying that he was questioning CPEC during his election rallies
 haalanki is yatra se lautakar aane ke baad unka swar badal gaya
 Imran was forced to knock on the door of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for financial support, which was what he criticized the previous governments for
 pakistan ke virdohi dalon ne unhen pehle hi "mistar you-turn'' kii oopaadhi se navaj diya he
 Since Imran's party Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) does not have a clear majority in the National Assembly, they will have to treat their coalition partners very cautiously
 naujavaanon kii vishaal taadaad naukari kii talash main he, un naukariyon kii talash main jo maujuud hi nahin hai, lihaaja imran kaa sabase zyada dhyaan mulk kii arthvyavastha se mukhaatib hone par hoga
 He will have to make his way and persist amidst these rude rumors that he is under the influence of his third wife Sufi scholar Bushra Bibi
 bushara bibi tantra-mantra kii baton main yakeen karti hai or unhen imran kii "casper da ghost'' kaha jaataa he, jo ek mashhoor cartoon siries kaa kirdaar he
 Former Kabina minister Mushahid Hussain, who recently joined the Pakistan Muslim League (nawaz), says, "imran will either succeed brilliantly or fail altogether
" pehle 100 dinon main unke najariye main spashtataa kii kami rahi he or ab bhi bahut zyada asthirataa or anischitata he
 There is a tremendous gap between word of mouth and things done
 to faisla abhi hona he
 "ironically, the only major success of his 100 days in power is his Kartarpur initiative
" yahaan tak ki yah baat mushahid bhi maanate hai
 On the other hand, the look and wait policy on Team Modi Imran is proving to give the opposite result
 imran siyasat main koi nae-nae khilaadi nahin hai
 He has been in politics since 1996 and like his cricket career here, he has shown passion and determination to succeed
 unamem ek khilaadi kii bhaichaare or vafadari kii bhaavana bhi he or protocol ko lekar ve adheer hai
 In Kartarpur, he risked criticism and showered praise on Sidhu for coming along and made no mention of Modi
 hindustan ko chahie ki unke saath nipatate vakt unki shakhsiyat kii in khaasiyaton ko dimag main rakhe
 As one expert says, "we should stop treating them like an army chief's orderly
 ve pakistan ke vajeer-e-ajam hai or ateet main hamane unase bhi kamjor pradhanmantriyon ke saath baatcheet kii thi
 Also, do not let them take credit for the work they are not entitled to
 ''hindustan kii chirsthayee purv shart ki—dihshatagardi band hone tak koi baatcheet nahin—ab sweekaarya hoti nahin dikhaai pad rahi he
 In the 26 / 11 case, Pakistan claims that the ball is in the court of India
 maamle ko teji se nattejey tak pahunchane ke liye magistrate ko 27 hindustani chashmadidon kii gavaahi chahie jo hindustan abhi tak muhaiyaa nahin kar sakaa he
 Seven members of the lashkar-e-taiba, including its operations commander zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi, are facing charges for planning and implementing the Mumbai attack
 magar saboot nahin hone kaa hawala dekar lakhvi ko jamaanat par chhod diya gaya or tabhi se vah bhumigat he
 The former head of the Federal Investigative Agency (FIA) and Tariq Khosa, who was then associated with 26 / 11, revealed the circumstances of the case in a 2015 article in Pakistan's English newspaper Dawn
 unhone likhaa tha, "pakistan ko mumbai kii tabaahi kaa hisaab dena hoga, jo uski jameen se yojana banakar launch kii gai thi
 
 
 The matter has been a matter of long standing
 bachaav paksh kii taalamatol kii karstaniyon, trial jajon ko baar-baar badalanaa or maamle ke abhiyojak kii hatya or uske saath-saath kai ahm gavaahon kaa apane mul bayaan se palat janaa naalish karne waalon ke liye sanjeeda jatke rahe hai
 To hide behind the judicial guise, India should curse Pakistan
 yahaan tak ki imran ne bhi is maamle main koi vaada karne yaa bayaan dene se inkaar kar diya, yah kahkar ki "kyonki yah masalaa nyaayalay ke vichaaradhin he
 "to pull back on 26 / 11, the Ministry of External Affairs should make the Indian people and the international community aware of the latest situation so that Imran can be kept under pressure
 teen saal tak rajya main gaddinshin rahe pidipi-bhaajapa ke gathbandhan ke dhah jane ke baad, yah pataa chalata he ki hindustan kashmir main bhurabhuri jameen par khadaa he
 This is the reason why Pakistan is pushing for talks on Kashmir, because it realizes the weakness of India
 vidhansabha ko uske kaarykaal ke thik adhabich main bhang kar dene or sarkaar banane ke liye saath aane ko raji teen partiyon—pidipi, neshnal conference (ensi) or congress ko mauka nahin dene ke liye rajyapal satyapal malik kii aalochana kii ja rahi he
 Among the ridiculous and absurd reasons that Malik gave, there were reasons that the fax was not working and the Governor did not get a letter claiming to form the government of the parties
 modi ne ghati main apni galatiyon ko tab or badha liya or pechida bana liya jab bhaajapa ke rajya prabharee ram madhav ne ajeebogareeb aarope lagaaya ki teenon partiyaan pakistan ke nirdesh par kaam kar rahi thim
 Mocking it, Omar Abdullah replied, "how could Pakistanis send it — the fax machine was not working at all
" '' iskaa dosha pakistan ke jimme madhkar bhaajapa kahin na kahin yah bhi sweekaar kar rahi thi ki ghati main islamabad kaa prabhaav ek baar phir pareshaani paidaa karne vaali had tak bad gaya he
 Army Chief Rawat has clarified that the level of infiltration in the valley has come down and the situation is under control
 magar bhartiya sena tak yah sweekaar karti he ki naujavaanon main badhati kattarta gambhir samasya ban gai he
 The Modi government's too much dependence on security forces to bring Kashmir under control is not giving good results and seems to have missed its ideas
 kashmir ke liye sainya samaadhaan bhi kargar nahin hoga, kyonki pakistani fouj bhartiya sena ke kisi bhi abhiyaan kaa muqabla kar sakati he
 Despite being a superior and top military force, did China not pull back from the Doklam clash in 2017? There is a need for political intervention and diplomatic engagement in Kashmir to revive the situation
 yah bhi ek vajah he ki imran khan ke saath baatcheet karnaa kyon ahm he
 Modi's game plan should now be to accept his request to start the process of dialogue, instead of hitting him with excuses or attacking him
 or phir ek agenda tay karke yah dekha jaae ki ve use puraa kar pate hai yaa nahin
 Since Imran has invited Modi to resume the SAARC process and attend the next meeting in Islamabad, Hindustan should force him to keep his stand clear on certain things
 apni pichhali baithkon main saarc desh rail network ke jariye apane bich connactivity badhaane, urja sahyog karne or european union (iyu) kii tarah ek-duusare kii motor gadipoon ko seemaa paar aane-jane dene ke liye raji hue the
 Pakistan has been causing disruptions till now
 imran se ab poocha ja saktaa he ki kya ve apni kahi baaten jameen par utaar sakate hai
 There is a SAARC treaty on terrorism and criminal action which Pakistan has not implemented; All these issues can also be raised with him
 haal ke varshon main hindustan ne apana ek ahm patta ganvaa diya he—logon se logon ke bich sampark ko badhaava dena—or isaki vajah paabandiyaan lagane vaali vija niti rahi he
 Now to counter the impact of Kartarpur, the Indian High Commission should follow a more liberal visa policy and force Pakistan to do so as well
 khud kartarpur par hi use vija-mukt vyavastha ke taur-tareeke tay karne ke liye pahal ek baar phir apane haath main leni chahie
 At the same time, it should also be ensured that extremist elements cannot misuse it
 niyantran rekha par ise un raaston par nae sire se najar daalane ke liye kahana chahie jinhen kholaa ja saktaa he, taaki donon ore ke kashmir ke bich awajahi kahin zyada swatantra ho or unke bich vyapaar bade
 An agreement to improve the munabav-khokhrapar rail link to connect Jodhpur and Karachi is also pending
 phir bade dotarafa vyapaar samjhaute bhi hai jinaki tasdik karne se pakistan inkaar karata rahaa he
 These include granting India the status of Most Favored Nation (MFN)
 hindustan ko pakistan se kahana chahie ki mej par baitho or in sabko hal karo
 For starters, India can ask Pakistan to start working on its logistic network for trade on the outskirts

 kendriya petroleum mantridharmendra pradhanne india today group ke mind rox 2018 ke manch se daawa kiya ki modi sarkaar kiujjwala yojanapuri tarah se safal sabit hui he
 Rejecting the opposition's charge, Pradhan claimed that out of the total number of people who have benefited from the scheme, around 80 per cent have already issued new cylinders at least four times
 dharmendra pradhan ne daawa kiya ki modi sarkaar ne tel par tex se ekatra hue paise se ujjwala gas yojana ke tahat desh ke garib pariwaron ko madad pahunchaai he
 Apart from this, investment has been made in Ayushman Bharat scheme
 is paise kaa istemaal karte hue sarkaar ne desh main nai sadakon ke nirmaan kaa kaam kiya he
 Over the past four years, more than 20 AIIMS hospitals have been opened across the country and new iits and iims have been opened
 pradhan ne kaha ki modi sarkarenergyke maamle main aatmanirbhar hona chaahati hai
 Apart from this, India will help the whole world to become self-sufficient
 pradhan ne kaha ki aane vaale tees saal main jahaan puri duniya main 100 unit kii bijli khapat hogi to isamen lagbhag 30 unit bijli kaa khapat bharat main hoga
 In such a situation, our effort is to reduce the dependence on petroleum products by using alternative energy and biofuel resources
 petroleum se sarkari munafa garibon ke liye jaruri, nahin kam honge damadharmendra pradhan me kaha ki congress sarkaar ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan aam aadmi ko sasta petrol-dijal dene ke naam par sarkaar ke khajaane par karj kaa bada boj choda tha
 But the current Modi government believes in keeping the debt free from the common man instead of taking advantage of the common man
 vahiin petrol or dijal samet petrol utpaada ko jiesti ke daayre main laane ke sawaal par dharmendra pradhan ne kaha ki jiesti council ek saal se iske liye koshish kar rahi he
 Many states had strongly opposed this but once again if the states are ready in its favor, then the work of including petrol and diesel in GST will be done as soon as the time comes
 jiesti ke patari se utarane ko lekar rajyon ko mat kosie
 The center has made this improvement on the head
 ses tex nahin he
 It is an opaque part of the taxation
 ise lagaaya kisi naam se jaataa he or istemaal kahin or hota he
 States object to this because cesses live outside the tax pool in which the states share
 pichley maah jab log bainkon kii linon main lage the or sansad thap thi, niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) kii ek report ai thi jo centre sarkaar ke ses raaj kaa sabase taaja khulaasa he
 Let us know from where and how much is being charged from us
 
 
 
 1
 mobile vaala taxbahuton ko yah jaankaree nahin hogi kimobile oparataraganvon main phone or internet pahunchane ke liye apane rajasav par ek vishesh tex dete hai
 Which is called universal access levy
 yah tex hamaare telephone bill par hi lagata he
 The Universal Obligation Fund (USO Fund) has been created for its expenditure
 sieji ke mutabik is levi se 2002-03 se 2015-16 ke bich 66117 karod rupee jutaaye gaye
 Of which only Rs 39113 crore was given to the USO Fund
 kya sarkaar is sawaal kaa jawaab degi agar gaanvon main phone pahunch chukaa he to phir yah levi kyon vasuuli ja rahi he or agar yah paisa jamaa he to iskaa istemaal mobile network thik karne va kol drop rokane main kyon nahin ho saktaa
 2
 padhai vaala tex-2006-07 main ucch shiksha va madhyamik shiksha kaa str aadhunik banane ke lieinakam taxpar ek fisadi kaa khaas ses lagaaya gaya tha
 64228 crores was raised from this cess till 2015-16
 sieji bataata he ki iske istemaal ke liye sarkaar ne na to koi fund banaaya or na hi kisi skim ko yah paisa diya gaya
 If there is enough money for education then why burden on taxpayer? Why doesn't the country get account of its use? - Under primary education, there is also a two per cent primary education cess on income tax to raise money for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Mid Day Meal, for which primary education fund has been created
 is kosh ko 2004-15 ke bich jutai gai puri raashi nahin di gai
 3
 dhuaan mitaane vaala taxbijli ke saaf suthere or dhuanrahit utpaadan kii pariyojnaon ke liye 2010-11 main ekaclin energy fundbana tha
 For this fund, cess is imposed on mining of domestic coal and import of foreign coal , which makes electricity expensive
 2010 se 2015 ke bich sarkaar ne is ses se 15174 karod rupee jutaaye lekin energy fund ko mili keval 8916 karod rupee
 However, in the 2016 budget, the government changed its name to double the rate of cess by clearing environment cess
 4
 Another Cess poll has been revealed in the research report of taxcag
 hame shaayad hi pataa ho ki takneekon ke aayaat par sarkaar motaa ses lagaati he
 The Research and Development Cess Act has been in force since 1986, under which 5% cess is levied on technical imports to meet the expenses of domestic technology research
 ses kii raashi technology deveopment board ko di jaati he
 From 1996-97 to 2014-15, Rs 5783 crore was raised from this cess but the fund received Rs 549 crore under the board
 5
 Not only this
 
 
 
 Road development cess on petrol diesel for the development of roads is also not fully available to the road fund
 pichhali sarkaron ke lagaae ses na to kam the or na hi unke hisaab main gafalat thik ho pai thi
 But the Modi government introduced three new cess in its three budgets
 sarvice tex par krishi kalyaan ses or swachd bharat ses lagaaya gaya jabaki kaaron par 2
 Infrastructure cess has been sticking between 5% and 4%
 pichley do saal main sarkaar ne kabhi nahin bataaya ki safai or kheti ke naam par lage ses kaa paisa aakhir kin pariyojnaon main ja rahaa he? Amid the ongoing tussle over the Prime Ministerial candidate in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), party leader Uma Bharti on Thursday hinted at Advani as the prime ministerial candidate
 uma bharti ne kaha, ‘kisi pad ke bhukhe nahin he adwani, wo 1995 main ban sakate the pradhanmantri
 Face recognition, win prizes
 bhaag lene ke lieclic karenvaranasi ke bharat mata mandir main bhaajapa kii jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue uma ne kaha, ‘bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai main adwani ji bahut sakasham netaa hai
 'photo: In the presence of senior BJP leaders like Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi and Kalraj Mishra on the unseen picture of Uma Bharti, he said,' Whatever leader from Baba Vishwanath's land Kashi has raised the challenge of corruption, he has not only corruption But has reached the Prime Minister's chair
 ’ uma ne kaha, ‘jisane shuru kii varanasi se bhrashtachar virdohi muhim wo bana pradhanmantri
 See in the pictures, giving the example of LK Advani's former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Bharti said, "singh had also started the journey against corruption from here and later he became the Prime Minister
 ’photoh laalkrishna adwani kii jan chetana yatra shuru |video dekhenuttar pradesh main aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa kii vaapasi kaa bharosa jataate hue uma ne kaha ki bhaajapa satta main aakar uttar pradesh kaa kayakalp karegi
 Under no circumstances will the party tie up with other parties like Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP)
 dekhie jab uma bharti ke saath somnath mandir pahunche adwaniudhar, uma bharti ke bayaan par adwani ne safai di he or kaha he ki kisi khaas shaks ke phaayde ke liye nahin he yatra
 This rath yatra is for corruption and the country
 dekhie kaise filmi dhunon par thirakin uma bharatiadwani kii rathyatra uttar pradesh se madhyapradesh kii ore batch gai he or ab wo raat satna main bithaayenge

 Currently, no shops have been sealed by the MCD in Greater Kailash, but the shopkeepers fear that the next number is not theirs
 isi kaaran kareeb 225 dukaane aaj yahan band rakhi gai hai
 Rajendra Sharda, chairman of the association of the market located in m block in Greater Kailash, says that shops are being closed without notice, which is very wrong

 In the first six months of the second term of the Modi government, after the passage of three big bills related to the BJP ideology from the Rajya Sabha, the strategists of the government have given a distinction to the Rajya Sabha fort which is considered impenetrable
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill par rajyasabha main sarkaar ko 125 vot mili
 Whereas BJP has its own strength of 83
 sahyogi dalon ke saath yah sankhya bamushkil sau paar kar 106 par pahunchati he
 But by garnering such a large amount of support, the BJP has won a psychological victory over the opposition Congress
 haalanki ranneetikaar kulasa karne ko taiyaar nahin hai, parantu ishaara mil rahaa he ki congress ke bheetar sab kuch saamaanya nahin he or bijepi ek baar phir congress main send lagane main kaamyaab rahi he
 The Opposition figure is 112 with the Shiv Sena
 shivasena ke walk out ke baad vipaksh ko 109 vot milane chahie the, jabaki use keval 99 vot mili
 Together, 16 members were absent
 isamen bijepi ke saansad anil baluni or bijepi ko samarthan de rahe asambaddha sadsy amar singh kaa swasthya kaarnon se pehle se hi aana tay nahin tha
 Meanwhile, the absence of ncp's Majid Memon and Vandana Kumari was already reported
 yani 12 anya sadsy gaiyrhaazir rahe
 In this, KD Singh of Trinamool Congress has been absent before and has been helping the government
 isi tarah sapa ke beniprasad verma bhi kharaab swasthya kii vajah se nahin aa sake
 Now the question is who are the remaining 10 members who helped the government in a way by being absent
 isamen teen sadasyon kii shivasena bhi shaamil he, jisane congress ke dabaav ke baad you turn liya or matdaan main hissaa nahin liya
 In the Rajya Sabha voting on the citizenship amendment bill, Chunbhai Kanjibhai Gohel and Anil Baluni of BJP, Dr Kanwardeep Singh of Trinamool Congress, Independents Amar Singh, Rajaram and Ashok Siddharth of BSP, Beniprasad Verma of SP, NCP Vandana Chauhan and Majid Memon of Shiv Sena Sanjay Raut, Rajkumar Dhoot and Anil Desai, jds's d Kupendra Reddy, Independent MP Virendra Kumar, trs's Dharmapuri Srin The crowns of the residences and the Congress remained sweet
 baaki bache 7 sadasyon main kaha ja rahaa he ki congress ke chaar sadsy hai, jinke bare main sthiti spasht nahin he
 This is a major setback for the Congress, whose Bhubaneswar Kalita, who was the chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, resigned in the previous session and joined the BJP
 bijepi ne karnataka farmula lagaate hue rajyasabha main apni takat badhaai he
 In this formula, resignations are made from mps of opposition parties
 aisa kar congress, sapa jaisi kai partiyon ke saansad bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai, jinhen bijepi ne ab apane cote se rajyasabha main bheja he
 BJP now has 83 seats in Rajya Sabha, the highest in history
 bijepi ke ranneetikaar yaad dilaate hai ki modi ke pehle kaarykaal main rajyasabha main vipaksh is qadar haaavee tha ki loksabhaa main baari bahumat ke baavjood modi sarkaar ke bill rajya sabha main atak jaaya karte the
 Even the Aadhaar bill had to be passed and introduced as a money bill
 kyonki congress iske sakht khilaaf thi
 At the same time, the situation has changed in modi-two that even the controversial bills like triple talaq, Article 370 and now the Citizenship Amendment Bill were easily passed by Rajya Sabha
 bijepi ko jediu, ediemke, bijedy, vyesar congress or yahaan tak kii tidipi kaa saath mila he, jo loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bahut tikhe andaaj main endie se alag hui thi
 With the support of these parties, the BJP has broken the system of Rajya Sabha
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar bhi rajyasabha main bahumat na hone ke kaaran kai bilon ko paarit nahin kara saki thi or aatankwaad virdohi kanoon pota ko sansad kaa sanyukt satr bula kar paarit karana padaa tha
 The Modi government has not yet called a joint session to pass any bill
 sarkaar ke ranneetikaar kehete hai ki rajya sabha main ab jis tarah se congress ko patkani di gai he, uske baad endie kaa bahumat na hone ke baavjood yahaan se kisi bhi bill ko paarit karaane main ab koi pareshaani nahin aegi

 com / sjldg7u95c western kentki uniwarsity ke 60 main se kam se kam 25 bhartiya graduate student se pehle semester ke baad computer science kii apni padhai chhodane ko kaha gaya kyonki ve iske pravesh maanakon ko puraa nahin karte
 This information has been given today in a news report in the media
 is kadam kii vajah se chaatr yaa to bharat waapas lautne ko majaboor honge yaa unhen america main kisi duusari uniwarsity kii talash kerani hogi
 Last year, these students were enrolled in January after a recruitment drive in the summer and were given temptations like exemption in education fees
 uniwarsity ne chaatro ko jutaney ke liye antarrashtriya agenciyon kii madad lee thi jinhone vigyaapan ke jariye chaatro ko lubhaaya or iske liye unhen uniwarsity se prati chaatr kii dar se raashi bhi adaa kii gai thi
 James Gary, chairman of the university's computer science course, said yesterday that about 40 students did not meet the criteria required for their admission
 neuyark timesne unke hawaale se kaha ki kuch chaatro ko paathyakram main bane rahane kii anumati hogi jabaki kareeb 60 main se 25 chaatro ko paathyakram chhodana hoga
 He said that allowing students to remain in the subject would be like putting good money in the wrong place as they are unable to write about computer programs which are an essential part of the curriculum
 is bich, western kentki uniwarsity ke bhartiya chaatr sangh ke chairman aditya sharma ne chaatro ke bhavishya ko lekar chintaa jataai he
 Begging in Delhi is no longer a crime
 lekin ye jaanakar aap hairaan ho jaaenge ki hoicourt ke aadesh ke mahinebhar baad bhi kareeb 500 bhikhaari avaidh tareeke se dilli sarkaar kii jail main band hai
 On 8 August, the Delhi High Court removed beggary from the category of crime while giving relief to beggars
 court ke is aadesh bhi dilli sarkaar kii tahitpur sthit bhikhaariyon kii jail main kareeb 478 sajayaftaa kaidi avaidh rup se band hai
 More than half of the prisoners suffer from severe diseases of Leprosy and TB
 kuch kii sazaa 6 maheene main puri ho rahi he to kuch kii 8 maheene main
 So they will be released as soon as the sentence is completed, but where will they go, what will they do? So far, the government has not made any plan at the policy level
 bhayankar bimariyon kii vajah se samaaj ne unhen nahin apanaaya
 After the abolition of the Beggar Act, he cannot be kept in jail even for one day by law
 lekin begar act khatm hone ke baad bhi kis kanoon ke tahat unhen jail main rakhaa gaya he iskaa dilli sarkaar ke paas koi jawaab nahin he
 The law says that they will have to leave when the sentence is done
 samaaj klyaan mantri rajendra paal gautam kii daleel he ki bhikhaari grih ko chhodkar jane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 These have been placed here before the High Court order
 unhone kaha ki hoicourt kaa dilli main bheekh maangane vaale act ko khatm karnaa sirf majaburi main bheekh maangane vaale logon ko bachaane ke liye he, jabaki gang aaj bhi haath-pair katkar bheekh maangane par majaboor kar rahe hai or iske liye kanoon main sazaa kaa praavdhaan bhi he
 But a cabinet bill is being considered, which will benefit those who are begging under compulsion
 sarkaar unke liye skill devlepment training dene par vichaar kar rahi he
 Also, 250 rupees per day is being considered for such people
 band hone kii kagaar par gruhabegar act ke khatm hote hi dilli kaa sabase bada or ek maatr functional home (jahaan ljayaftaa bhikhaari rakhe jate hai) band hone kii kagaar par he
 There are 11 houses for beggars in Delhi where they are kept
 isamen bhikhaariyon kaa rahanaa, khaanaa, or counselling kii jaati he
 It has a capacity to hold 2180 prisoners
 chunki ab bheekh maangana jurm nahin he to aise main ab ye grih viraan pade hai
 a total of 10 houses have been closed for the time being
 keval tahitpur sthit 1 hi grih main 478 sajayaftaa kaidi rakhe gaye hai
 Every house has a different budget
 bataa den ki tahitpur ke grih kii dekh-rekh ke liye kareeb 5 karod rupee kaa salanaa kharch aata he
 2959 every year at Delhi Government Inn Home
 1 lakh (kareeb 30 karod kaa bajet) alott karti he
 a total of 337 employees have been appointed to look after these bagged homes
 ab sawaal ye bhi he ki sarkaar unase koun sa kaam legi?aapako bataa den ki sarkari aankadon ke anusaar, bharat main lagbhag 4,13,670 bhikhaari hai, jisamen 2,21,673 purush or 1,91,997 mahilaayein shaamil hai
 What the High Court says: During the hearing, the Delhi High Court said that any punishment to beggars is against the fundamental rights, so they cannot be punished in any kind of criminal case
 court ne kaha ki kisi bhi bhukhe vyakti ko rhite tu spich ke tahat roti maangane kaa adhikaar he
 In fact, if any person was caught begging, then he had a provision of punishment of 1 to 3 years, which has now ended
 bhikhaari ke duusari baar pakade jane par usko 10 saal tak kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan tha, lekin ab hoicourt ke aadesh ke baad use khatm kar diya gaya he
 The Mumbai Prevention of Bagger Act 1959 was enacted in Delhi on 2 June 1960
 bhikshavriti ko aparaadh kii shrenee se hataa diya gaya he, isliye jaise bhikhaariyon ke pehle pakade jane par unke fingerprints liye jate the ab aisa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 You can consider this to be an example of how merciless nature can be

 rashtriya rajdhani sthit ek panchasitara hotel taj ke suit main 37 saal se rah rahe ek udyogpati kaa nidhan ho gaya
 He was ill for a long time
 police ne bataaya ki daadi balsara 37 saal se yahaan taj maansingh hotel ke suite main rah rahe the
 Last night, as the illness worsened, the hotel staff took him to the hospital where he was declared brought dead
 balsara kii patni kaa 2009 main nidhan ho gaya tha
 They had no children
 atirikt police ayukta esbs tyaagi ne kaha ki balsara lambey samay se biimaar chal rahe the
 Since Balsara had been staying at the hotel for so many years, the hotel had entered into a compromise with him
 unhen chhot ke saath suit diya gaya tha or iskaa kiraaya lagbhag 15000 rupee prati din he
 Balsara founded Mount Everest Mineral Water Limited in 1991
 ise 2001 main tata ne kharid liya jo aaj himalayan brands se mineral water bechati he
 According to the police, Balsara has about Rs 250 crore in his account

 Surrounded by numerous allegations of corruption and crime, Suresh Kalmadi and Abhay Chautala were made members of the Indian Olympic Association for their lifetime
 donon rajanetaaon kaa lambey antaraal tak bhartiya khel kii duniya main dakhal rahaa or is dauraan in par gambhir aapraadhik aarope lage
 Both were removed from the Sports Management Committee
 ioe ke is faisle par khel mantralay ne hairaani jataai or khel mantri ne apane ghar par hi samvaadadaata sammelan bula kar isaki aalochana or is par jaanch baitaane kaa nirnay liya
 However, within 24 hours of this decision, Kalmadi himself expressed his inability to take up the post, but Abhay Chautala has not yet made up his mind to reject the post
 is saal rio olympic main mahila tikdi pivi sindhu, sakshi malik or deepa karmakar ke pradarshan se jahaan cricket se itar khel jagat ko kuch saakaratmak sanket mili vahiin is hairaan kar dene vaale faisle ne saal ke ant main ek baar niraashaa ke badal bikher die
 This unprecedented decision of the Indian Olympic Association is like taking ten wrong steps after one right which needed to be avoided
 kya he kalmari kaa khelon se naata?1996 se 2011 tak bhartiya olympic sangh ke adhyaksh rah chuke suresh kalmari nai dilli main yojit rashtramandal khelon (2010) kii aayojan samiti ke bhi pramukh the
 Kalmadi was accused of corruption by misusing her position after a large-scale economic irregularity over the Commonwealth Games
 unhen hatana padaa
 When jailed, three-time MP Kalmadi was also dismissed by the Congress party
 10 maheene jail main rahane ke baad kalmari ko jamaanat par reeha kiya gaya
 Kalmadi was also the President of the Asian Athletics Federation from 2000 to 2013 during the tenure of the Olympic Association President and in March last year, during his tenure, he was made its life honorary President for contributing to the development of athletics in Asia
 abhaya chautaala kaa kya he khel parichay?chautaala kaa bhi ioe main purana kaarykaal vivaadon bharaa rahaa tha
 Abhay Chautala is an accused in a disproportionate assets case
 chautaala bhartiya ameor mukkebaaji mahasang ke bhi adhyaksh rah chuke hai jisaki manyata 2013 main radd kar di gai thi
 Chautala was the President of the IOA from December 2012 to February 2012 and it was during his tenure that the International Olympic Association suspended the Indian Olympic Association over the election disturbances
 yah nilamban tab tak jari rahaa jab tak chautaala or kalmari ko prabandhan se hataaya nahin gaya
 It is necessary to state that there is nothing special to do with the Honorary President as the economic and administrative powers come under the purview of the Chairman N
 Ramachandran
 yani ek tarah se in donon ko ek jhunjhuna bhar pakadaaya gaya jo sangh kii purv adhyakshon ko maanad adhyaksh banane kii parampara ke tahat he
 At the same time, neither the office nor any authority is given to the honorary president so that he can interfere in the daily work
 bhartiya olympic sangh kii kaaryakari samiti main adhyaksh, varisht upaadhyaksh, aath varisht upaadhyaksh, mahasachiv, koshadhyaksh, chah sanyukt sachiv, kaaryakari parishad ke 10 sadsy, athlete ayog kaa ek chaynit pratinidhi rahata he
 These are the ones who run the Sangh
 maanad adhyakshon ko salanaa aam baithak main bulaayaa ja saktaa he lekin inhen vot dene kaa adhikaar nahin hota
 Opening the Sports Minister's face to this decision in a hurry, the long standing unchanged management rules of these sports federations working autonomously in the coming days are pointing to the possibility of changing the rules

 kangra kaa brajareshwari shaktipeeth maa kaa ek aisa dham he jahaan pahunch kar bhakton kaa har dukh unki takalif maa kii ek jhalak bhar dekhne se dur ho jaati he
 This Shaktipeeth of the mother out of the 52 Shaktipeeths where the right chest of Sati fell and where the three pindis of the mother are worshiped as a symbol of the three religions
 pahaado ke nahalaati surya dev kii pavitra kirane or bhor ke aagaman par sone si damakati kangra kii vishaal parvat shrinkhalaa ko dekh aisa lagata he ki maano kisi nipun johari ne ghati par sone kii chadar hi madh di ho
 Such a panoramic view that even nature for a moment rose to its form
 kangra kaa nagarpur dham, maa ke shaktipeethon main se ek maa brajareshwari devi ke dham ke bare me kehete hai ki jab maa sati ne pita ke dwaara kiye gaye shiv ke apmaan se kupit hokar apane pita raja daksh ke yajna kunda main kudakar apane praan tyaag die the, tab krodhit shiv unki deh ko lekar puri sristi main ghume
 To calm Shiva's wrath, Lord Vishnu cut Mata Sati's body into pieces with her chakra
 sharir ke yah tukade dharti par jahaan-jahaan gire vah sthaan shaktipeeth kahalaaya
 It is believed that the right breast of the mother Sati fell here, so the mother's chest is worshiped in Brajreshwari Shaktipeeth
 mata brajareshwari kaa yah shaktipeeth apane aap main anuthi or vishesh he kyonki yahaan maatr hindu bhakt hi sheesh nahin jhukaate balki muslim or sikh dharm ke shraddhalu bhi is dham main aakar apni aasthaa ke phool chadhaate hai
 It is said that the three domes of the Brajeshwari Devi temple symbolize these three religions
 pehla hindu dharm kaa pratik he, jisaki akruti mandir jaisi he to doosraa muslim samaaj kaa or teesraa gumbad sikh sampradaay kaa pratik he
 Mother damsels are also three in this abode of mother with three domes and called the center of faith of three sects

 The second mother is of Bhadrakali and the third and the youngest Pindi mother is Ekadashi
 maa ke is shaktipeeth main hi unke param bhakt dhyanu ne apana sheesh arpit kiya tha
 Therefore, the devotees of the mother who are also followers of Dhyanu, wear yellow clothes and come to the temple and worship themselves, and bless themselves
 kehete hai jo bhi bhakt man main sachhee shraddha lekar maa ke is darbar main pahunchataa he uski koi bhi manokamana adhuri nahin rahati
 Then whether it is the wish of your desired spouse or the longing to have children
 maa apane har bhakt kii muraad puri karti hai
 In this court of the mother, there is a law of aarti five times, which every devotee wishes to witness
 maa brajeshwari devi kii is shaktipeeth main pratidin maa kii paanch baar aarti hoti he
 The bed of the mother is first raised as soon as the doors of the temple are opened in the morning
 uske baad raatri ke shringaar main hi maa kii mangala aarti kii jaati he
 After Mangala Aarti, the mother's nightly makeup is taken off and her three bodies are anointed with panchamrit of water, milk, curd, ghee and honey
 uske baad pile chandan se maa kaa shringaar kar unhen nae vastra or sone ke aabhushan pahanaaen jate hai
 Then with the help of chana puri, fruits and dry fruits, the morning aarti of the mother is done
 yahaan, dopaher kii aarti or bhoga chadhaane kii rasm ko gupt rakhaa jaataa he
 The temple doors are closed for the midday Arti, when the devotees get their children shaved at a special place built in the temple premises itself
 manyata he ki yahaan bacchon kaa mundan karwaane se maa bacchon ke jivan kii samast aapadaaon ko har leti hai
 There is also a temple of Lord Bhairav in the temple premises, but women visiting this temple are completely forbidden
 yahaan viraaje bhagwaan bhairav kii murti badi hi khaas he kehete hai jab bhi kangra par koi musiibat aane vaali hoti he to is murti kii ankhon se aansu or sharir se pasinaa nikalne lagata he
 Then the temple priests organize a huge havan and request the mother to avoid the disaster and this is the miracle and glory of the Brajeshwari Shaktipeeth, every disaster is averted by the blessing of the mother
 dopaher baad mandir ke kapaat dobaaraa bhakton ke liye khol die jate hai or bhakt maa kaa aashirwad lene pahunch jate hai
 It is said that rice is not used on Ekadashi, but mother Ekadashi itself is present in this Shaktipeeth, therefore rice is offered here as a bhog
 suryaast ke baad in pindion ko snaan karakar panchamrita se inkaa dobaaraa abhishek kiya jaataa he
 The mother is adorned by wearing red sandalwood, flowers and new clothes, and with it the evening is celebrated
