 mandya main baba ke sammaan main 2003 main sthapit kiye gaye satya sai mandir ke pramukh maadhegauda kaa kahana he, ''1963 main hi hamen bataa diya gaya tha ki baba kaa aglaa avatar mandya main hoga
 Now we cannot wait, Mandya has got a boon
 '' maadhegauda ne satya sai spikes, khand3 main darj byore ko uddhrut kiya he
 This scripture clearly states that on the day of Gurupurnima on July 16, 1963, Baba announced among his devotees that he was in love with Prem Sai in Mysore State, located between Bangalore and Mysore (mysore was renamed Karnataka in 1972)
 Will be reborn in form
 anumaan lagaaya gaya tha ki agle sai baba ko janm dene vaali mahila us ilaake main 15 saal pehle hi janm le chuki thi
 One of Baba's devotee Ram Pad says, "baba has told that Professor N
 kasturi kaa punarjanm us ladki ke rup main ho chukaa he or vah baba ke agle avatar ko janm degi
 "ram post claims that he has met Sathya Sai Baba's biographer Kasturi in Puttaparthi
 lekin in sabamein kai tarah kii asangatiyaan bhi hai
 Some of Baba's discourses that have been documented mention that his next incarnation will be born eight years after he leaves Ihloka at the age of 96
 kuch duusare record main zikr he ki baba ke nidhan ke ek saal ke bheetar aglaa avatar janm legaa
 Baba had announced that he would die at the age of 96, but he left Ihloka at the age of 85
 aise main unke shraddhalu unke punarjanm ko lekar ulajhn kii sthiti main pad gaye hai
 It is now being suggested that he may be reborn in 2012, 2019 and 2030
 haalanki is suchi main varsh 2011 shaamil nahin he, lekin baba is saal jab aspataal main bhartee hue the tabhi se unke shraddhaluon ne unke agle avatar kii khoj shuru kar di thi
 Sai Prasad, a devotee of Sai Ashram in Mandya, says, "when Sathya Sai Baba was born in 1926 in Puttaparthi, no one knew that he was the incarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi
 unhone 14 saal kii umr main swayan isaki ghoshnaa kii thi
 So, now there is no point in looking for Baba
 jab vakt aayega, baba khud ghoshnaa kar denge
 Legend has it that Sathya Sai Baba announced that he was the incarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi
 lekin shiridy ke sai baba ke bhakton ne satya sai baba ko kabhi unka avatar nahin mana
 Moreover, in 2006, his devotees filed a case in Rahata in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, demanding that the devotees of Sathya Sai Baba stop calling him an incarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba
 lekin yah maamla kabhi adaalat tak nahin pahunch sakaa
 Sai Rajesh Ram, a devotee and seeker of Prashanti Nilayam, the abode of the deceased Baba in Puttaparthi, says, "baba always said that he is the second of the three incarnations
 pehle shiridy ke baba the, or tisare prem sai baba honge
 Sathya Sai Baba is said to have given a ring to his devotee John Hislop in 1970, which had a vague image of his next incarnation
 vah chhavi vakt ke saath badalati rahi or phir ek dadhi vaale yuvak ke rup main dikhne lagi
 Hyslop wrote in his book My Baba and I, "the image has a man with a gentle face, hair on his shoulders, a beard and his posture is a lotus or he is emerging from it
 ''hislop ke anusaar, baba ne unhen bataaya tha, ''ab vah janm lene kii prakriya main he, lihaaja main abhi use zyada nahin dikhaa saktaa
 He is shown to the world for the first time
 '' 1980 tak hislop ko vishwaas ho chalaa tha ki cheharaa puri tarah aakaar le chukaa he
 Hislop died of cancer in 1995 and no trace of that ring is known yet, although people in the Puttaparthi ashram have produced several sketches
 bangaloru sthit sai mandir ke pramukh sai lokesh murti kaa kahana he, ''1940 main puttaparthi aisa gaanv tha jahaan na bijli thi, na pani
 There was no newspaper and there was no television
 phir bhi baba ko apane devatv ke bare main logon ko samajhane main koi samasya nahin hui
 Today, Prem Sai has already found a place in Wikipedia
 mujhe pakkaa yakeen he ki sheeghra hi ek fasebuk pej bhi ban jayega
 And there is no confusion about the date or year

 duusare lakhon logon kii tarah isamen koi bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 While the debate over the incarnation of Sathya Sai Baba is continuing, there is a struggle of power in Puttaparthi
 unke samrajya ke bhavishya or uske prabandhan ko lekar andeh ubhar rahe hai
 Baba's family played a minimal role in the programs of education, health and welfare
 ab vah vibhinn sansthaanon ke network par kabja jamaane kii koshish kar rahaa he

 The trustees dispelled future apprehensions from the draft prepared 24 hours before the funeral
 unhone kaha ki ve baba ke maargdarshan or prerana se ekajute hokar puri vinamrata se kaam karenge ''taaki jis trust kii unhone sthapana kii thi vah dushkar or asambhav lagane vaale kaaryon ko hakeekat main tabdeel karata rahe

 "while the SSSCT has devised arrangements to carry out all the activities in the physical absence of Sai Baba, Ratnakar, Satyajit and Chetna will try to make their influence and persuade the trustees to make generational changes
" ratnakar ne trustee or congress kaaryakarta ke rup main shuruyaat kar di he, jabaki duusare logon ko satya sai baba ke shraddhaluon kaa samarthan hasil he

 Maharashtra writer Dr
 narendra dabholkar hatyakand kii jaanch main lagi sibiai ke saamne roj cese se jude khulaase ho rahe hai
 The shooters who shot at Dabholkar were trained by two police officers from Maharashtra
 kareeb ek hafte kii ye training goa main sanathan sanstha ke headquarter ke paas or sangli main di gai thi
 The Goa Blast accused were killed in this case
 It has also been revealed that Dr
 dabholkar par goli chaalaane vaale koi or nahin goa blast ke aaropee saarang akolkar or rudra patil the
 Let me tell you, Narendra Dabholkar was murdered in August 2012 in Pune
 jab wo marning walk par ja rahe the
 Sanatan Sanstha demanded a polygraphy test, however, Sanatan Sanstha is not ready to believe that its seekers Virender Tawde and Sarang Akolkar have a hand in the murder
 ulte sanathan sanstha kii maang he ki is cese ke sarkari gavaah kaa poli graphy or narco test karavaaya janaa chahie
 Dabholkar's sketch of Sarang is found in Akholkar's sketches of Dabholkar's shooter
 saarang akolkar sanathan sanstha kaa sadhak he
 Akolkar is also looking for Goa Blast
 vah 2009 se faraar he
 The CBI also says that the accused
 virendra tavadejaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahaa he
 So forensic tests like narco analysis, brain mapping and polygraph can help CBI
 taavade kii patni se bhi sibiai poochtacha kar sakati he, jo kuch hi dinon main landan se bharat lautne vaali he
 Sanjay Sandavalkar is a history-sheeter, however, the Sanatan Sanstha held a press conference in Mumbai on Friday claiming that the main witness in the case, Sanjay Sandavalkar, is a history-sheeter
 uske bade netaaon se sambandh hai
 So he escaped from the law and is trying to trap Tawde
 sandvalakar ne kiye ahm khulasesanjay sandvalakar vahi sarkari gavaah he jisaki madad se sibiai taavade tak pahunchi
 Sandwalkar told Aaj Tak that for the first time in 2001, Dr
 virendra singh taavade se mila tha
 He himself is of right-wing ideology, so he became friends with Tawde
 donon ne 2004 main kolhapur main dabholkar ke ek bhaashan main rukaawat bhi daali thi, lekin 2008 ke baad taavade se uski mulaakaat nahin hui
 Meeting was held in the shop
 This witness also says that Tawde used to come to his shop with his two people and there was a meeting in the shop itself
 ek baar to taavade ne is gavaah ko desi revolver dikhaakar uski hoobahoo duusari revolver banane kaa kaam diya tha
 Despite being a radical himself, this witness says that he does not support violence
 isliye usne wo kaam nahin kiya
 According to Sandwalkar, he tried to tell the Kolhapur police and ATS about the activities of Virendra Tawde several times before the murder of Dabholkar, but no one took him seriously

 But this is no longer possible because the distribution of seats in the Lok Sabha is done according to the rules of the Lok Sabha

 Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary rejected these reports outright
 unhone twit kiya, na rahul gandhi ne or na hi congress party ne front ro kii seat kii maang rakhi, hamane rahul gandhi ke liye 466 number kii seat kaa prastaav rakhaa he

 unki bahan or congress kii mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra bhi unke saath amethi ke daure par ho sakati hai
 a party leader said that Rahul would meet party workers at Amethi's Gauriganj (district headquarters) and discuss the reasons for the loss in the recent Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad vah aam logon se bhi baatcheet karenge
 Rahul Gandhi lost the Lok Sabha elections to Union Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Smriti Irani by a margin of 55 thousand votes

 com / i3tl6fn0bw— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)november 14, 2015 The US presidential election will re-count the votes polled in Wisconsin, and the Democratic count Hillary Clinton's team will also be included in the re-vote
 duusari taraf america ke navnirvaachit raashtrapati donald trump ne green party kii ore se visconsin main maton kii dobaaraa ginati kii maang ko ghotaalaa qaraar dete hue kaha ki log matdaan kar chuke hai or ab chunaav khatm ho gaya he
 Trump's presidential candidate Jill Stine, who won by a narrow margin in Wisconsin, was pressured to re-count votes
 vah michigan or penlcevenia main bhi maton kii dobaaraa ginati kii maang kar rahi hai
 In the US presidential election held on November 8, Trump and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin unexpectedly won Hillary Clinton by a very narrow margin
 michigan main bhi unakijit kaa antarbahut kam tha
 Trump said - The result of the election should be respected New York billionaire Trump was accused of rigging the election continuously before his victory
 ab unhone ek bayaan main jor dekar kaha ki chunauti or gaali dene ke bajaay chunaav parinaam kaa sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 The elected president alleged that Stine raised $ 5
9 million, compared to $ 7 million to fill his coffers on the pretext of re-counting the vote
 trump ne green party kii pratyaashee kii ore se dobaaraa matdaan kii yachika daalane ke ek din baad kaha, 'logon ne matdaan kar diya he or ab chunaav khatm ho gaye hai
 Hillary Clinton herself admitted this on election night
 'hillari michigan, pencilvenia main bhi voton kii dobaaraa ginati ke samarthan mengrene party kii taraf se voton kii dobaaraa ginati kii yachika rajya ke chunaav ayog ne sweekaar kar lee he
 Hillary Clinton's campaign team said in the morning that they would be involved in the re-counting of votes from the Green Party
 iske alaava unhone michigan or pencilvenia main bhi maton kii dobaaraa ginati kaa samarthan karenge
 Arvind Kejriwal, an important member of Team Anna, has said that he has no objection to bringing all the big ngos under the ambit of Lokpal
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main kejariwal ne kaha ki pradhanmantri, sibiai or si evam di shrenee ke sarkari karmchaariyon ko lokapal ke daayre se baahar rakhaa janaa unhen pasand nahin hoga
 However, Kejriwal said that the Lokpal bill should be waited till the Parliament session
 haalanki unhone enjio ke niyaman ke liye alag se kanoon kii vakaalat kii
 He also said that there is corruption in the media but to deal with it, the Press Council of India needs to be strengthened further
 gauratlab he ki media main aa rahi khabaron ke mutabik lokapal bill kaa pehla draft sansadeey samiti ne taiyaar kar liya he or isamen lokapal ke daayre main videsh se aarthik sahaayta praapt karne vaali enjio ko bhi rakhaa gaya he
 Non-governmental organizations of prominent members of Team Anna Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Kiran Bedi receive financial support from abroad
 yadi cameti dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya draft sansad main paas ho gaya to in teenon ke enjio bhi lokapal ke daayre main aaenge
 Asked whether the talk of bringing their lower level (group c and D) government employees within the ambit of Lokpal has been ignored in the draft Lokpal Bill, Kejriwal said that if this is the case then Group c and D's employees will get a free hand to spread corruption as there will be no one to catch them
 agle saal hone vaale upi vidhansabha chunaavon main agar bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ek majboot daavedaar he to uske peeche dalit raajnneeti kaa itihaas judaa hua he

 unhen jujhna bhi pad rahaa he
 In fact, his rise tells the story of his challenge as well as the sharp rise of Dalit politics in the country in the last three decades
 aaj dalit raajnneeti itani ahm or dhardaar he ki ateet ke pannon main bhimrao ambedkar ke saath jis sangh or uske pratinidhiyon ke tikhe virodh rahe, vahi ambedkar kii viraasat ko hathiyaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Not only this, Dalits are also prominent in the BJP and Sangh's strategy — from Ambedkar Jayanti to the Dhakkam Chetna Yatra in UP
 vahiin, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne goraksha ke naam par agar chuppi todi thi to vah bhi una main daliton kii barbar pitayee ke baad
 Only after this, Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel finally had to announce her resignation on social media
 isi tarah satta main aane ke baad pichley do saal main endie sarkaar kii chulein agar kisi jan-aakrosh ne hilaayaa he to ve una or rohit vemula andolan hai
 Obviously, in the present scenario, if the Dalits have reached this status politically and socially, then the last three decades have been very important for this change
 agar peeche mudakar dekhen to nazren kanshiram par thahar jaati hai
 After Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram was the only one who, through hard work, brought change for the Dalits at the grassroots level, at least in Uttar Pradesh
 unhone 1982 main apni kitaab da chamachaa age main aalochana kii ki kis tarah dalit netaa apane samudaay ke hiton ko taak par rakhkar paramparaagat mukhyadhara kii party ke liye kaam karte hai
 This view shows his intention
 1984 main unhone bispi kii sthapana kii
 Mainstream newspapers never took it seriously
 lekin party kaaryakartaaon ne bahujan samaaj ke bich apana sandesh pahunchaa diya
 In the 1988 Allahabad by-election, one of the important slogans of the party was written on the walls - 'vote is ours, Raj is yours, will not do, will not do'
 1993 upi vidhansabha main usne 67 siten jeet lee thim to apane upar sapaayiyon ke hamale ke baad bijepi ke sahyog se mayawati mahaj 39 saal kii umr main 3 june 1995 ko upi kii pehali dalit mukhyamantri baniin
 She then became the Chief Minister in 1997 and again in 2002
 kabhi shtilak, taraazoo or talwaar, inako maaro juute charya kaa naaraa lagane vaali or aakraamakata se 'bahujan' kii baat karne vaali bispi baad main 'sarvajan' ke nazariye ke saath ai or 2007 main upi main 403 vidhansabha siton main se 206 seat jitkar purna bahumat kii sarkaar banaaya
 The BSP completed a cycle of Dalit politics by constructing grand Dalit monuments at various places in the state
 yah upi main vot ke jariye badlaav kii daastaan he to bihar main daliton ke saamaajik badlaav main pichley teen dashak khunriji se bhare rahe hai
 This battle of land, rights and equality has sometimes resulted in the massacre of Dalits
 isamen savarna jatiyon kii senaaon or dalit-pichhadi jatiyon ke sanghathan main bheeshan ghaat-pratighaat hua
 The massacres that began in the late seventies continued until 2000 in Mianpur in Aurangabad
 pichhadon ke siyaasi ubhaar ke dauraan bihar main dalit chehre ke bataur ramvilas paswan ubhare, jinaki party algepi 2005 vidhansabha chunaav main 29 siten jitkar rajya main kingmekar kii haisiyat main pahunch gai par unhone satta main shaamil na hone kaa faisla kiya or agle chunaav main party kaa bura hashr hua
 Whatever the immediate reason, Nitish Kumar anonymously handed over the seat of Chief Minister to Jitan Ram Manjhi in 2014
 par maanjhi ne jab nitish ke khilaaf bigul foonka to unhen munh kii khaani padi
 At the same time, Paswan has also been reduced to mere 'political weather forecasters'
 isi tarah maharashtra main ambedkar se judi rahi republican party of india kai tukdon main bant gai
 Even if Ramdas Athawale is in central politics, he is tied with BJP
 shiksha ke kshetra main daliton main bada badlaav aayaa he
 The 22 years old Tina Dabi topped the Sangh Lok Seva Service 2015 is an example of Dalit bullying in education and government jobs
 vahiin 1991 main daliton kii sakshartaa dar mahaj 37
 There were 41 and Dalit women only 23
 76
 But by 2001, the Dalits left the rest in terms of increasing literacy rate
 2001 main daliton kii sakshartaa dar 46 fisadi kii badhotaree hui to kul rashtriya sakshartaa dar main mahaj 24 fisadi
 Similarly, in 2011, the literacy rate of Dalits increased by about 20 percent, while the overall national literacy rate was just 14 percent
 isi tarah, ucch shiksha se lekar hair secondary main bhi pichley dashak main daliton kii bhagidaari ullekhneey dhang se badi he
 For example, where the number of Dalits pursuing graduation or above has increased by 139 per cent in 2011 as compared to 2001, there has been an increase of 81 per cent among such people in the country
 jaahir he, shiksha ke maamle main pichley teen dashakon main unki vruddhi joardaar he
 But in contrast, atrocities on Dalits still continue
 neshnal krime recodrs (enciarabi) beuro ke mutabik, 2015 main desh main daliton ke khilaaf kul 45,003 maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 In 1991, when the crime statistics against Dalits were collected for the first time in NCRB, it was 18,336, which was increased to 33,908 in 1994
 dalit chintakon ke mutabik, isaki do ahm vajahen hai—pehali to jaagrukta aane ke saath daliton ne apane maamalon ko darj karana shuru kiya, duusari ki daliton ke utthan or aawaaj uthaane ke saath-saath ucch jatiyaan bhi unke prati aakraamak ho gayi
 The resentment in the country over the Una and Vemula issue is due to the blatant presence of the new generation of Dalits
 vanchiton ne takanic yani soshal media ko ahm hathiyaar banaaya he
 At present, Dalits are registering a presence in the private sector despite very little participation
 dalit indian chembar of commers and industry (diisisiai) ke mutabik, 2001-02 main 10
 There were 5 lakh Dalit entrepreneurs, who crossed 28 lakh in 2006–7 and they are growing at a rate of around 25 per cent
 udhar siyaasi paridrishy main 2009 upi vidhansabha chunaav or 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad aglaa vidhansabha chunaav bispi ke liye kathin chunauti he
 Along with Dalit politics, there are many challenges facing Dalits today (read Sukhdev Thorat's article) but in spite of this, in the last three decades, Dalits have achieved some remarkable socio-political achievements
 vaaki ye dashak unke liye parivartankaree rahe hai

 The Delhi High Court on Tuesday handed over the missing case of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Najeeb Ahmed to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
 najeeb ahamed oktober 2016 se gumshuda he
 a division bench of Justice GS Sistani and Justice Rekha Pillai referred the matter to the CBI with immediate effect
 isse pehle dilli police ne kaha ki yadi adaalat is maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunpti he to use koi aapatti nahin hogi

 PM Modi will lay the foundation stone for many development schemes in Jammu and Kashmir, but the special thing is that in the presence of PM Modi, martyr Aurangzeb's father Mohammad Hanif will join BJP today
 bataa den ki shaury chakra se sammanit shahid aurangzeb ko aatankiyon ne beete saal agava kar maar daalaa tha
 Mohammad Hanif is satisfied with BJP
 unhen lagata he ki aatankiyon ke khilaaf kashmir main agar koi sarkaar kaam kar sakati he to wo bijepi hi he or bijepi hanif ko party main shaamil kara ke ye sandesh dena chaahati he ki shahid javaanon ke parivaar bijepi ke samarthak hai
 Time will tell how much BJP will benefit from this in the Lok Sabha elections, but it is so sure that Hurriyat's breath is stuck on PM Modi's rally
 hurriyat ne aaj kashmir main band bulaayaa he
 Let us know that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is different from the rest of the states, so the color of politics here also looks different

 How Aurangzeb was killed? On the morning of June 14 last year, Aurangzeb was going to his village in Rajouri to celebrate Eid
 isi dauraan pulavama ke kalampora se aatankwaadiyon ne unka apharan kar liya tha
 On the evening of 14 June, a joint team of police and army recovered the body of Aurangzeb in a village named Gussu, about 10 km from Kalampora
 unke sir or gardan par goliyaan maari gai thim
 According to some reports, he was also tortured before the killing of the martyr
 hamaari nyaayik sansthaaen puraani ghadiyon kii tarah hai jinhen tel pilaane, chaabi bharne or sahi samay par laane kii jarurat he
 (lord Harry Woolf, Lord Chief Justice of England, 2000–2005) India's Supreme Court's reach is ubiquitous in the country
 na sirf rajyon ke hycorton (28 rajyon or sangh shasit pradeshon ke liye kul 18 hycourt hai) ke antim faislon par balki deshbhar kii panchaton (rajyastareey or kendriya) par iskaa ikhtiyaar he
 Hundreds of such tribunals are working in the country
 iske alaava supreme court dwaara banaae gaye kanoon or maujuuda kanoonon kii vaidhata par isaki vyakhya desh kii sabhi adaalaton or adhikranon par samvidhan ke tahat badhyakaari he
 In fact, there is no area within the jurisdiction of the legislature or the executive that is outside the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
 supreme court ke adhikaar kshetra main 20 lakh varg mile kaa bhartiya ilaaka or 1
 It has a population of 2 billion
 aadhunik praudyogiki kaa istemaal karte hue bharat kaa supreme court jabardast kaam kar rahaa he or isane apni alag pahchaan banaai he
 Despite this, during the last 10 years, the trust of people on our established legal system has decreased because the law may have been made all the time, but justice was not got in that proportion
 baaten tamaam kii gayi, lekin nyaayik sudhaar nahin hue
 We have to move forward now: we have to do something different, something we have never done before
 mote taur par main kuch suzav de rahaa hum
 * The long time it takes to deliver justice should be curtailed: Just like we have a three-pronged judicial system, the cases go on and on
 isaki ek pramukh vajah yah he ki vakil apane mukademe se jude puraane faisle or kanoonon ko kot karne main kaaphi vakt barabaad karte hai
 The legal reports that have been published here in the last few years have some useful decisions, but most are also unusable
 america main bhi pehle aisi hi dikkat thi, lekin purv nirnyon kii baadh ko thaamne ke liye vahaan kadai se ek nyaayik upkaran ko lagu kiya gaya he jise ''faislon kaa aprakashan'' kehete hai
 Unpublication means that a decision or judicial opinion related to a trial is limited to the facts of that case only, and is therefore not considered suitable for publication in a government law report
 ise jab website par 'aprakashit' faisle kii shrenee main daal diya jaataa he, tab koi bhi vakil uskaa uddhran court main nahin de saktaa
 It has proved to be very effective in America
 america kii sangheey adaalaton ke 'aprakashit faislon' kii dar philhal 80 fisadi he
 To do this in India, a lot of hard work has to be done
 hajaaron faislon kii padtaal kar ke unhen 'aprakashit' ghoshit karnaa padegaa, lekin yah prayaas kaaphi kargar hoga
 This will prevent the delay in handling the cases
 *nyaayik tantra ke bheetar panchaton ke gathan kii pravriti par roak lageh zyaadaatar yachikakartaon ko yahi lagata he ki unhen sirf hycourt yaa phir supreme court main hi insaaf mil paaegaa, baavjood iske ki apili adhikranon main oonchi adaalaton ke avkaash praapt nyaayadhish hi faisla dete hai
 The decision on the majority of cases falling under such tribunals is challenged by the petitioner in the High Court (under the writ petitions described in Article 226) and finally takes it to the Supreme Court (under Article 136)
 is tarah antim faisla hone main kaaphi der ho jaati he or is prakriya main ye apili adhikaran apraasangik ho jate hai
 * Misguided petitions attract damages: One of the major failures of our judicial system is that despite the system of law, the price for mistakes is not sought
 kisi bhi ashanka ke tahat kii gai apusht yachika or janhit yachika daalane vaale ke man main dand bhugatne kaa dar adaalaton ko paidaa karnaa chahie
 For example, projects and programs created by governments have been stuck for years only because of petitions put in the High Court (and in the Supreme Court) on the possibility of corruption and the petitioners have no direct interest in such cases
 jab traasad nyaayik prakriya ke ant main aisi janhit yachikaaon ko khaarij kar diya jaataa he, to is dauraan samudaayon ko pariyojna ke lagu na hone se jo nuksaan hota he, uski bharpai karnaa hi asambhav hota he
 * Prohibition of the process of recommendation of judges for appointment of judges: The existing method of appointment of judges in higher courts has become irrelevant
 hycorton or supreme court ke nyaayadhish apane saamne aae mukademon ko nibatane main sakasham hai, lekin anubhav dikhaata he ki hair jeudiciri kii niyukti kii badhyakaari sifarish karne ke maamle main un par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 * In the High Courts where there is already a litany of cases, distinguished and experienced members of the Bar can be appointed as judges for two, three or five years and after being relieved from this post they can advocate in the same court again
 , Such an arrangement can be given
 hycorton main maamalon ko nibatane kii gati par isse kaaphi fark padegaa
 * Abolish the Judge (protection) Act 1985: This law provided for the first time any court award for any activity, work, said word done by any present or former judge during the course of his judicial performance
 Or foreclosure will not hear the case
 ''mananeey nyaayadhishon'' (yakeen maniye, aise bahut hai) ko aisi atirikt suraksha kii jarurat nahin he
 Also, according to the goodwill that this 1985 law was made, it has become irrelevant now because it is a shield for a handful of wrongdoers
 pehle se hi karyrat nyaayadhishon kii swatantraaa ko surakshit karne ke liye 1968 kaa jajej inkvyri act maujuud he or meraa maananaa he ki is kanoon ko banaae rakhana chahie kyonki yah oonchi adaalaton ke jaj ko hataae jane kii prakriya kii aakhri kadi ko behad jatil bana detaa he-or aisa hi hona bhi chahie taaki jajon kii swatantraaa ko bachaae rakhaa ja sake
 Instead, the Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill 2010, which is being talked about, would be a very bad option
 is bill ne samasya sulajhane kii bajaae kahin zyada dikkatein khadi kar di hai
 Therefore it should be withdrawn or dismissed
 antim baat yah he ki nyaayik sudhaar kaa matlab sirf mukademon ke teevr nibatare se nahin he
 The 21st century judicial system would also have to maintain precedence in the matter of self-governance, implying discipline against the legal problems (which are often both legal and political)
 ise alaava nyaayadhishon kii jivan style main bhi zyada paardarshita or saarvajanik aalochana ke prati sahishnutaa paidaa karne kii jarurat he
 The way the petitioner earlier used to accept the judge's decision, now it is not so
 nyaay vyavastha par kabhi jo sarvaadhik shuchita or sarvasatta vaali dharna kii chadar thi, vah utar chuki he
 Now it is difficult to give decisions
 kisi paksh ke mukadmaa haar jane par uske dwaara jaj ko saamaanya insaan ke taur par jimmedaar maan lene kaa chalan badha he
 People no longer consider him an impartial and uninteresting agent of the system
 yani nishaanaa ab gend par nahin, khilaadi par lagaaya ja rahaa he
 That is why there is a need for some ethical preaching and guidelines going from top to bottom (which people at the 'top' will also have to accept)
 jis tarah kaa hamaara desh he or jaisaa vakt chal rahaa he, us lihaaj se nyaaypalika ko karypalika or anya bahari prabhaavon se sirf swatantra rakhana hi paryaapt nahin he
 According to the high position on which our judges and the rights they have, they should be of the best quality, both at the level of the heart and the mind
 isse bhi zyada unhen saahsee hona chahie
 If there is gentleness and courage in the biggest court, then these qualities come down on their own
 is desh main nyaaypalika kaa jitna mahatv he, use dekhte hue bible kii ek sookhti or uske thik baad di gai chetavanee sateek baithti he jiskaa arth kuch yun banataa he-''tum hi dharti kii aas ho, lekin agar tumne hi aas chhod di to phir tumhen aas koun bandhaayega?'' It is May 14
 nitish kumaar ko haashie par dhakelne vaali matganana se 36 ghante pehle patna ke buddha smriti park main buddha kii murti ke saamne haath jodakar or ankhen band kiye prarthana karte dekha gaya
 It seemed as if the Chief Minister himself was relinquishing power
 or 17 may ko unhone mukhyamantri pad se istipha dekar andeshe ko sach main badal diya
 However, he left it to the BJP to demand dissolution of the assembly
 unhone 2009 main 40 main se 32 loksabhaa siton or 2010 main 243 vidhansabha siton main se 206 par jeet hasil karne vaale endie kaa netritv kiya tha
 It is believed that he has gone a long way to save his political existence by resigning
 isse unhen rajya main vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan satta virdohi lahar utani nahin jhelni padegi
 His party contested 38 out of 40 seats in Bihar in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but he has got only two seats
 unhone jab june, 2013 main bijepi se apana gathbandhan todaa tha to ve soch rahe the ki rajnatik ganit unke paksh main he
 Ultimately, the Backward Classes (ebcs) were part of their social base which they had prepared by running social welfare schemes
 yah 17 fisadi musalamaanon or 12 fisadi mahadaliton kaa bada hissaa tha, jo kaagaj par unhen ajey dikh rahaa tha
 But in the very first round of elections, it was indicated that the Muslims have chosen the lalu-congress alliance and a section of the EBC is supporting Narendra Modi
 ab to sabit bhi ho gaya he ki nitish kaa puraa ganit gadabada gaya
 When the BJP accused Nitish that they were trying to stop his backward caste leader ie Modi from becoming the Prime Minister, a large number of EBC voters fell out of Nitish
 yahi nahin, musalmaan lalu kii taraf waapas laut gaye
 The BJP managed to get 39 per cent of the vote, while its mainstay upper caste Brahmins, Bhumihars and Vaishyas constitute just 18 per cent of the population
 purv up-mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi or bihar ke party prabharee dharmendra pradhan ke netritv main bijepi kii rajya ikai ne jatiyon or samudaayon kaa nayaa gathbandhan banaaya
 He aligned Ram Vilas Paswan with the alliance of LJP and brought the Koiri community together by bringing Upendra Kushwaha of Lok Samata Party
 bijepi ne ibisi kii nishad jaisi sabase haashiye par rahane vaali jatiyon ko bhi todakar paramparaagat rup se virdohi maani jane vaali jatiyon ko saath le liya
 Analysts believe that by propagating Modi's backward caste and his development as male, the BJP created a foundation that included many layers of caste-based society
 gathbandhan ke sahare teji se aage bade nitish ne apni giravat kii patakatha khud likhi
 He was the face of the NDA alliance in Bihar, but the fact is that the committed cadre of the BJP did the ground work to bring their voters to the booth
 bijepi ke ek netaa kehete hai, ‘‘bijepi ke kader ke bina jedy (you) ke kaaryakarta nitish ke samarthan main bani hawa ko voton main tabdeel karaane main sakasham nahin ho pate
 However, despite the poor performance, the Chief Minister cannot be completely dismissed from the political ground of the state
 unhone kareeb 15
 Has garnered 7 per cent of the vote and many Muslims respect him for breaking the alliance with BJP over Modi's candidature
 rajya ke musalmaan bijepi ko dur rakhane ke liye jeetne kaa madda rakhane vaali party ke ummidavaaron ko vot karte rahe hai
 Such votes went to Lalu's court in the Lok Sabha elections, because the Muslims felt that Lalu was in a better position to stop the BJP
 rajya main ve aisi sthiti main nitish ko dekh sakate hai or shaayad jedy (you) netaa ko iskaa andaja he
 His resignation from the post of chief minister has given him a chance to prepare for the assembly elections
 chhattisgarh main farji jati pramaan patr or ank soochiyon ke jariye naukari karne vaale karmchaariyon ke khilaaf karrwai shuru ho gayi he

 andhra pradesh se alag telugana rajya ke gathan ke faisle ko jaise hi kendriya cabinet ne manjuuri di iskaa virod sadakon par hone laga he
 In such a situation, senior Congress leader and general secretary Digvijay Singh, who played an important role on the formation of Telangana, was interviewed by ndtv's Political Editor Manoranjan Bharti
 
 
 manoranjan bharti : andhra pradesh ko lekar kya nitiyaan chal rahi he, andhra jal rahaa he, bijli nahin he, bachche incubetter main he, ham kis chiz kaa intjaar kar rahe hai? Digvijay Singh: Telangana is not the topic today
 jab pehle rajya gathan ayog bana tha, us samay se telugana kii maang ho rahi he or usamen unhone telugana ke bare main ullekh kiya tha
 The demand for Telangana has been increasing from time to time
 iske vishay par maang hoti rahi, samjhaute hue kuch paalan hue, kuch nahin
 This demand has been made by the Congress mlas of Andhra Pradesh in the late 90s, when YSR Reddy was the Leader of the Opposition of the Congress, the President had more than 40 mlas applying for the demand for Telangana
 2004 ke chunaav main congress party ne chunaav ghoshnaptr main bhi use shaamil kiya
 Then it was also mentioned in the address of Hon'ble President
 2007−08 main kendra ne telugana par charchaa karne ke liye pranab mukherjee ko ye jimmaa saunpa or sabhi dalon se charchaa kii
 Everyone also agreed
 phir sabhi partiyon kii baithak bulaai
 When Shinde was the minister, everyone agreed, but the CPM could not give it
 iske purv chidambaram ji ne bayaan diya
 He created the Shri Krishna Commission
 un chah siforeeshon main se ek telugana kii thi
 Discussion continued on this, finally when everyone's consent came, the Congress decided
 faisle se pehle siem, dipti siem, congress cameti adhyaksh ko apni baat kor cameti ke saamne rakhane kaa mauka diya tha
 Manoranjan Bharti: You said all parties agreed
 abhi do khat bhi jari kiye
 You say that Jagan and Chandrababu Naidu, who are on strike, are backing away from their point? digvijay singh : yah puri tarah se raajnneetik avasarvadita he
 Why are you retreating after writing this letter? If there are any problems, please indicate
 ham niraakaran karenge, lekin bhadakaane vaale bayaan na den, jisamen simandhra main logon ko takalif ho
 Entertainment Bharti: Inciting statements
 
 
 or bhi dete hai Digvijay Singh: That is also wrong
 ham uskaa bhi virodh karte hai
 The kind of statements that KCR and his party have made are not appropriate
 manoranjan bharti : kya ye dikkat nahin he ki siem aapke paale main nahin hai, jo report saamne aa rahi he
 Even at the meeting of the Legislative Party, the party formed a new party outside
 digvijay singh : ye galat khabar he
 a separate party was neither decided, nor even considered by anyone
 ye baat galat he
 Entertainment: Do you think the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh is cooperating with you
 digvijay singh : nishchit taur par wo kathin samay main kaam kar rahe hai
 Entertainment: But the way there is black out, there is no electricity in hospitals, should they not put Esma
 digvijay singh : esama laga diya he, lekin esama ek drekonian lau he, charchaa hi ek madhyam he, jisase hal nikaala ja saktaa he
 This has led to talks with the employees of the electricity department
 aavashyak sarvice chaalu ho gai he
 Hospitals are operational
 kai jagahon par airport or trainon main bijli dena chaalu ho gaya he
 Still they have not withdrawn the movement in full way
 enjio kii strike par bhi baat chal rahi he
 We are trying to solve it quickly
 manoranjan bharti : kya kisi punarvichaar kii gunjaaish he? Digvijay Singh: There is no scope for reconsideration
 chote−chote dal to nirnay lekar palat sakate hai, lekin congress kii vishwasaneeyata alag he, isliye kah kar ham log palatate nahin hai
 Entertainment: If the situation worsens, is there an alternative to presidential rule? digvijay singh : raashtrapati shashan aakiri vikalp hona chahie
 There should be complete confidence that the government elected by the people should work
 manoranjan bharti : aapane abhi ek rajya banaaya
 Made while you live
 koi virodh nahin hua
 Even the entire business built in Bihar went away and there was no protest
 ab jab telugana jaisaa garib rajya bananaa chaahate hai to kya rasukhdaar reddy log jo paanch se chah pratishat hai, kya wo isliye naaraaz hai ki unke haath se satta ja rahi he, unke haath raajnneetik−aarthik takat he? Digvijay Singh: Reddy Telangana Andhra and Seemandhra are everywhere, so they are not a subject of caste, people of Seemandhra have trouble with the case of Hyderabad by creating a separate state
 pani or sansadhano ke bantwaare ke maamle par main kahana chaahunga ki simandhra ke logon ko jo hyderabad main based hai, unke saath nyaay hoga
 i want to assure the people of Seemandhra that they will not be harmed and will not be discriminated against
 shiksha, sehat or naukari ke maamalon main bhi koi bhedbhaav nahin hoga
 Hyderabad will remain the joint capital of the two states for 10 years
 manoranjan bharti : jagan ke saath congress kaa kya ravaiya hoga
 It seems that Jagan Mohan Reddy is taking a soft stand towards the Congress
 digvijay singh : jahaan tak jagan kaa sawaal he, uski muldhara congress he
 Though Jagan had done some wrongdoing, due to which he is facing many difficulties, but the person who belongs to the Congress cannot be communal
 manoranjan bharti : aapako kya lagata he ki andhra pradesh main chal rahaa bavaal kya jaldi thik ho jayega
 Digvijay Singh: On this matter, i would say that we should both hope and try manoranjan bharti : kya aap lagaataar mukhyamantri ke sampark main hai
 Digvijay Singh: Yes, i am in touch with the Chief Minister
 manoranjan bharti : rahul gandhi ne daagiyon par laae gaye adhyadesh ke maamle par jo bhi kaha us andaaz ko aap kaise dekhte hai? Digvijay Singh: Rahul Gandhi has raised a very important issue, do not know how much people have understood it
 chote chote alpakaaleen faaydon ke liye ham log agar samjhauta karne lage to ham bhrashtachar kabhi khatm nahin kar paaenge, isliye nafaa ho yaa nuksaan bhrashtachar se ladanaa hi chahie
 Manoranjan Bharti: The attitude of Rahul Gandhi as a youth leader may not have liked many people, what is your reaction to it? digvijay singh : dekhie jo log rahul ke tevar ko acha nahin maan rahe hai unako is baat ko samajhnaa chahie ki iske peeche mul bhaavana kya he, mul bhaavana yah thi ki isaki koi aavashyakta nahin thi or ye sab aise logon ke kilaaf ho rahaa he jin par kai saare aarope hai
 Therefore, there is no harm in the decision they took and the way they spoke
 manoranjan bharti : sibiai kaa kahana he ki mayawati ke kilaaf aarope nahin banataa he or rahul kehete hai ki mayawati daliton ko aage nahin aane deteen hai, ye do alag−alag vichaardhaaraein hai, thodaa sanshay he? Digvijay Singh: There is no doubt, as far as Mayawati is concerned, she is standing on the legacy of Kanshi Ram ji, Mayawati does her own politics
 kya kaaran he ki uttar pradesh ke alaava bispi kisi or rajya main aage bad nahin pai
 Many other Scheduled Caste people live in other states as well, 16% people in Madhya Pradesh also come from the Scheduled Castes, Mayawati has her own politics, but the Congress ideology is different, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Nehru
 And it follows their own paths and not according to caste
 
 
 manoranjan bharti : to kya 2014 ke chunaav main bispi congress ke saath nahin hogi? Digvijay Singh: Any politics is based on possibilities and if seen now, the events that have taken place in Uttar Pradesh, a Chaurasi Kosi Yatra which was demanded by Vishwa Hindu Parishad and at a time when Chaturmas was going on It was, in this case, no saints cross the drain or river, this journey has been done before, but it is always around Chaitra Baisakh and Ramnavami, first SP He also met Ashok Sinhala, then arrested him and then allowed the press conference
 agar sapa is yatra ko rokna chaahati thi, to phir press conference kii ijazat kyon di
 This makes me suspect of match fixing
 isi tarah muzaffarnagar kii ghatana kai dinon se aage bad rahi thi
 There was a constant ruckus, if action was taken in time, it would not have increased so much
 manoranjan bharti : in donon ghatnaayen ke peeche aap kiskaa haath dekhte hai
 Those in power, or those of BJP
 digvijay singh : sahi myne main isamen bijepi kaa haath he, kyonki bijepi or narendra modi, ye jaanate hai ki bina danga karaae unki raajnneeti is desh main nahin chal sakati
 The BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh have always played politics over the dead bodies of innocents
 yahi unki koshish hameshaa se rahi he or aage bhi rahegi
 Manoranjan Bharati: Then how will you stop it? digvijay singh : jahaan tak gaiyr-congressi rajyon kii baat he, to ye to unke upar he, lekin jin rajyon main congress kaa shashan he, wo vidhi vyavastha ke prati zimmedaar hai
 Action should be taken strictly against them, so communal forces should be monitored, irrespective of any community
 manoranjan bharti : narendra modi ke bare main aap kya kahana chaahate hai? Digvijay Singh: Modi talks about the development model of Gujarat, but in reality there is no development in Gujarat, Modi makes false promises of development in Gujarat, today every citizen of Gujarat owes more than any citizen of the country
 saath hi jab modi sarkaar main aae the to gujarat par karz baaise hazaar karod kaa tha, jo ab ek lakh chalis hazaar karod kaa ho chukaa he
 Manoranjan Bharti: It is a Deadly Cocktail
 If you add the words of development, there is no other way
 digvijay singh : ham log to vichaardhaara kii ladaai ladate hue aae hai, hamaare vyaktitv par koi daag nahin he, lekin ye vyakti to apane aap ko mahamandit karata rahata he, aap ek baat samaj lijie ki is vyakti ko jis haath ne khilaayaa he, ye usee haath ko kha gaya he, ham modi ko koi chunauti nahin maanate hai, modi to khud bijepi ke liye hi chunauti hai
 Manoranjan Bharti: The atmosphere is present in Muzaffarnagar in today's time
 aap is par kya kahenge
 Digvijay Singh: The riots benefit those who do politics of division of Hindus and Muslims
 congress party hameshaa donon samudaayon ke saath lekar chalati he, yaad rakhie ki dange ke maahaul main hameshaa sampradayikta failaane waalon ke liye taaliyaan bajati hai
 Manoranjan Bharti: Rahul Gandhi also went to Gujarat and said that the 2014 Lok Sabha elections will be on the lines of do or die
 digvijay singh : 2014 kaa chunaav karo yaa maro kii tarj par nahin hoga ye naaraa to british hukumat ko bhagane ke liye tha
 Today there is no such thing, in politics we do our own work
 apni−apni ladaai ladate hai or janata jo nirnay leti he, use sweekaar karte hai
 Manoranjan Bharti: If this election is not done on the lines of die or will the workers not be disappointed? digvijay singh : hamaari ladaai vichaardhaara kii ladaai he, jis vichaardhaara ne gandhi kii hatya kii, hamaari ladaai us vichaardhaara ke kilaaf hameshaa rahegi
 
 
 Manoranjan Bharti: Rahul's statement on the ordinance targeting his SP and BSP at Wednesday's rally, then should it be understood that Rahul is running the Congress party
 
 Digvijay Singh: As far as the government is concerned, he is running Manmohan Singh, Rahul is carrying out the responsibility that Soniaji had given to Rahul
 
 
 manoranjan bharti : adhyadesh vaali press conference main ajay maakan adhyadesh kaa bachaav kar rahe the or jaise hi rahul ne bayaan diya to maakan ne kaha ki rahul ji ne jo kaha wo hi party line he
 a minister also said that 'the boss is always right', then what should be understood that the Congress boss is Rahul Gandhi
 digvijay singh : rahul gandhi congress ke upaadhyaksh hai
 That is why he is on the number-2 position in our party, so what is the objection in this? manoranjan bharti : to kya rahul gandhi hi ab sabakuch tay kar rahe hai
 Digvijay Singh: Rahul Gandhi also takes many important decisions, but Sonia Gandhi makes the last decision
 manoranjan bharti : jaldi hi paanch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai, kya anumaan laga rahe hai aap? Digvijay Singh: i never speculate for elections, our effort will be to succeed in forming a government
 manoranjan bharti : log kah rahe hai ki madhya pradesh main congress kaa prachaar acha chal rahaa he, lekin wo prachaar hit and ran tip kaa he
 Leaders from Delhi go and give speeches digvijay singh : aisa nahin he har kshetra ke ummidavaar or kaaryakarta apana kaam kar rahe hai, hamaara puraa sanghathan juta hua he
 Manoranjan Bharti: Won't you contest the assembly elections
 digvijay singh : haa main vidhansabha kaa chunaav nahin laduunga
 Manoranjan Bharati: Isn't Jyotiraditya also contesting elections
 digvijay singh : shaayad jyotiraditya bhi chunaav nahin lard rahe hai
 Manoranjan Bharti: Who will be the chief ministerial candidate in Madhya Pradesh? digvijay singh : pehle bahumat mil jane dijie, uske baad tay kiya jayega
 Manoranjan Bharti: Will you contest the Lok Sabha elections? digvijay singh : agar mujhe mauka mila, to main loksabhaa kaa chunaav laduunga
 Manoranjan Bharti: There are elections in Chhattisgarh, what is the situation there, it is being said that if Ajit Jogi is given the command, then the seats can be removed
 digvijay singh : main chhattisgarh bahut dinon se gaya nahin hum, isliye vahaan ke rajnatik halaat kii mujhe jaankaree nahin he, main sirf itnaa jaanata hum ki jis dughartna main hamaare itane varisht netaa chal based unke prati logon ke man main sahanbhuti he, pichley 10 saalon se raman singh ne chhattisgarh kii janata ko bahut lutaa he, isse logon main kaaphi naaraazgi he
 Manoranjan Bharti: Then what will you say on the elections of five states or will you win


 digvijay singh : ham hameshaa jeetne ke liye chunaav ladate aae hai or ladate rahenge
 This time too, we will contest well

 And new people are coming
 jo pehali baar yahaan aa rahe vah dilli, gujarat, mumbai se aa rahe hai
 People who are coming here say that "earning 300 / 400 is difficult and there is no work
" 10 / 12 hazaar bhi kabhi-kabhi nahin ho paata he
 "due to the large number of people coming from other states like us, the employment of local (tamil) laborers here is having a great impact
 jo tamil log pehle din-raat kaam karte the unhen ab kaam hin nahin miltaa he
 Because almost all the work is done on contract here, and the contractor benefits from the Hindi labor, because the Hindi people do not know the language, they have wandered from Delhi, Mumbai, Gujarat and reached here now where will they go from here? They lift a lot, they give daily wages as much as they do
 pichley hafte 2235 rupee kaa kaam kiya tha
 Here most companies get money in a week

 Because of us, the Tamil labor is being harmed, now there are two ways in front of them that one should work as much as the daily wage and the other should not work
 thekedaar ko sasta lever chahie
 Tamil laborers look at the Hindi laborers with fallen eyes
 kehete hai hindi aa kar yahaan kachra failaa diya he
 The company keeps a few people for the name, also cuts PF etc
 inside
 aise logon kii sankhya bahut kam he
 In the same market, people from outside states have great respect, because most people do not know the language because of that they do not bargain
 bhashaa kii samaj nahin hone kaa phayda dukandaar bhi khub uthaate hai
 Now what should i write more? bihar ke yuva to ab kashmir hin jaaenge

 film 'club 60' kii kahani 60 or usase zyada umr kuch kirdaaron ke ird-gird gumti he

 During this time he meets Manu Bhai (raghuveer Yadav), who makes the doctor a member of 'club 60', and here he meets the gang of '60'
 
 
 film main bataaya gaya he ki har insaan kii zindagi main koi na koi takalif zarur hoti he
 
 
 If someone has seen the death of their child, then the son of someone has become a householder and has settled in the in-laws
 
 
 kisi kaa betaa videsh jaakar maa-baap kii khabar tak nahin letaa
 
 
 That is, sorrows are related to the life of every human being
 
 
 aise halaat main kis tarah khush rahanaa chahie, kaise khush rahaa ja saktaa he, yahi sab dikhaaya gaya he 'club 60' main
 
 
 The film does not have a superstar, but the actors are older, who have acted tremendously
 
 
 film bade bajet kii bhi nahin he, magar isaki kahani or soch kaaphi badi he
 
 
 There is no item song in the film, but whatever one or two songs are, the story is very well threaded
 
 
 film main bhale hi koi kamedian bhi nahin he, magar gujarati manu bhai ke kirdaar ne manoranjan kiya he
 
 
 Farrukh Sheikh and Sarika have lost their lives in the roles of a gamzada husband and wife
 
 
 kul milakar diarector sanjay treepathi ne na sirf bujurgon ke dukh-dard ko bahut sundarataa se darshaya he, balki unke zindagi se maze lene ke tareekon, or unke hansi-mazaaq ke palon ko bhi khubsuurati se filmaaya he
 
 
 It was also a good experience to see how these elders live with each other, in happiness, and also in grief
 
 
 kis tarah ladakiyon se flert kiya karte hai
 
 
 i wish, the marketing budget of the film would have been larger and the film could have reached more and more people
 
 
 vaise, kuch seen lambey khinche hai
 
 
 Especially the climax scene is not digested
 
 
 rishton par aadhaarit film ne acha sandesh dene kii koshish kii he
 
 
 'club 60' also gives the message that our own or others' sorrow is less than sharing and growing by sharing happiness
 
 
 isliye is film ke liye meri reating he 3
 5 stars

 In the raids, the police recovered those books from the university library
 chhapemari kaa virodh karne ke chakkar main ajam khan ke bete abdullah ko hiraasat main le liya gaya
 Ali Jauhar University, spread over several square kilometers, was started in the year 2006 by Azam Khan
 vishvavidyal ke bheetar kaa parisar behad bhavy he

 There is a gleaming wide road within the university
 vishvavidhyalay ke bheetar vaais chancelar wing banakar taiyaar ho rahaa he to duusare hisson main bhi lagaataar nirmaan kaary jari he
 Since the raids, a large number of police have been deployed outside the university
 jiske chalate yahaan padhane vaale chaatro ke bheetar bhay kaa maahaul he
 Students allege that the police is stopping but ADM HC Gupta of Rampur says that all these arrangements are for only 1 day
 chaatro ko koi takalif nahin hone di jaaegi
 On the controversy of stealing religious texts, many university students say that all these incidents and allegations are false
 vishvavidhyalay ke aakhri hisse ke ek kinare par aalishaan masjid he to bich main mal ke liye bhi jagah banaai gai he
 a collection of vintage vehicles is also seen within the university

 Many children are also seen pulling selfies near this cannon
 lekin vishvavidhyalay kaa naam vivaadon main aane ke baad yahaan padhane vaale bacchon ke bheetar bhi bhavishya ko lekar chintaa he
 Children from Moradabad, Bareilly to Kanpur come here to study
 yahaan padhane vaale ek chaatr sachin kaa kahana he ki maa-baap chintaa main hai or kah rahe hai ki waapas aa jaao
 Many students feel that the university will not be closed after the controversy
 vishvavidhyalay main chhapemari ke baad se hi librari ke mukhya dwaar par bada sa taala lataka hua he
 Many thousands of children study in this university of Azam Khan
 aise main unka vishvavidhyalay hi vivaadon ke saae main aa jaae to phikr karnaa laazmi he
 In the Gujarat assembly elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi campaigned with full force
 rahul ne apane dam par gujarat navasarjan yatra ke tahat chaar charnon main prachaar kiya
 Rahul went straight to the 135 assembly constituencies of the state
 jabaki 42 vidhansabhaon ko unhone apratyaksh rup se cover kiya
 From tea shops to Rahul temple, he kept wandering, yet he could not shake the foundation of the BJP which has been in power for 22 years
 darasal, iske peeche badi vajah sthaneey netritv kii kamajori bhi mana ja rahaa he
 Political analysts are also claiming that results cannot be commensurate by not going to a state for two-three months and not contesting elections
 aise main sanghathan kii jo majbootee bijepi ke liye taaranhar banati he, vahi kamjor party sanghathan congress ke liye haar kaa sabab banataa dikhaai de rahaa he
 Even the big local leaders who were with the Congress, the Congress failed to keep them together
 shankar singh waghela wo naam hai, jo gujarat kii raajnneeti main bada dakhal rakhte hai or unka vahaan kaaphi asar mana jaataa he
 But after his displeasure with the party leadership, on 21 July 2017, on his 77th birthday, this senior leader announced his end of relationship with the Congress
 khali waghela kii kamirahul gandhi ke puure chunaav prachaar ko dekha jaae to unke saath har kadam par gujarat ke prabharee ashok gahalot khadey najar aae
 Apart from Gehlot, Gujarat Congress president Bharat Singh Solanki, Arjun Modhwadia and Shaktisinh Gohil appeared in public forums along with Rahul
 gujarat main congress ke ye wo sthaneey netaa hai, jo khud chunavi raajnneeti main pichad gaye hai
 Arjun Modhwadia is one of the senior-most leaders of the Congress and he has lost the election once again from the Porbandar seat after 2012
 duusari taraf shaktisingh gohil kii baat kii jaae to wo bhi is baar chunaav haar gaye hai
 In 2012, he lost elections from Abdasa seat, this time the party gave him ticket from Mandvi seat, despite this he could not manage to save his seat
 vahiin, bharat singh solanki ne is baar chunaav hi nahin ladaa
 That is, the big leaders of Congress with whom Rahul Gandhi was going in the campaign in Gujarat have no support base of their own
 aise main shankar singh waghela jaise bade gujarati chehre kii kami congress ko khali
 Indeed, the lack of Vaghela was also felt for another reason
 rahul gandhi puure prachaar ke dauraan hindi main bhaashan dete rahe, jabaki piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne sthaneey bhashaa main hi gujarat kii janata ko sambodhit kiya
 If Vaghela had shared the stage with Rahul, he might have been able to address his voice in Gujarati and keep the Congress talking properly
 yani jis bijepi main narendra modi or amit shah jaise bade gujarati chehre the
 The Congress had none
 rahul bhale hi puure damakham ke saath vahaan gaye hon, lekin unka raajnneetik kariyar modi-shah ke saamne tik nahin sakaa or bouna sabit hua
 This is the reason why Shankar Singh Vaghela's factor has also gone in favor of BJP, it is believed
 haalanki, wo pichley chunaav main congress ke saath the or party ko is baar se kam siten mili thim
 But due to the support of Patidars and obcs in the current elections, caste equations were seen in favor of Congress and its position looked strong
 ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bhale hi waghela bijepi ke saath nahin the, lekin congress ko nuksaan pahunchane main unhone koi kasar nahin chodi
 It was also revealed that at the behest of Vaghela, 11 Congress and NCP mlas cross-voted in the presidential election, after which a dozen Congress mlas came under suspicion
 antat: unhone congress kaa haath chhod bijepi kaa daaman tham liya
 Actually, Vaghela also warned the Congress leadership in this regard
 teen dashak se adhik samay se pradesh kii raajnneeti main sakriy bhoomika nibhaane vaale 77-varshiya waghela ne kaha tha ki agar congress ne pehle se chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar di hoti, to vah jeet sakati thi
 On leaving the party, Vaghela had also clarified that he had made it clear to Rahul Gandhi that he did not want to become CM
 waghela ko ye safai isliye dena padi thi, kyonki un par siem pad kii daavedaari ko lekar demand ke aarope lag rahe the
 However, the election results have not given the Congress a chance to discuss the Chief Minister's name and Rahul has failed in another election exam

 bollywood kii mashhoor adaakara rekha rekha ne apane kariyar kii shuruyaat 13 saal kii
 He struggled a lot to succeed in his life
 ek intervyuu main rekha ne bataaya tha ki maine apane kariyar kii shuruyaat paariwarik halaat thik nahin hone kii vajah se kii thi
 Rekha's father was superstar Gemini Ganesan but she never got support from him
 rekha kaa apane pita ke saath rishta ajanabi jaisaa hi rahaa
 He said of the father in a chat show, "I saw him, but didn't feel
 jab log fadar shabd bolte hen to mujhe carch ke fadar sabase pehle yaad aate hai
 i would not even say that i missed them so much, because how could i feel the lack of a relationship that was never there
 "ek baar sabase chaunkaa dene vaali baat rekha ne ye kahi thi, "mujhe nahin lagata mere pita ne kabhi mujhe dekha bhi
 Yes, i have seen him, seen his films, but never felt in real life
 "ye tha rekh kaa asli sapanaais bare main rekha ne kaha tha, "main kabhi actress nahin bananaa chaahati thi
 Just wanted to get married, live with husband and have lots of children
 ye to kismat thi jo main yahaan tak (cinema) pahunch gai
 Yes, i am not sorry for this, i am thankful for what i got, but first my dream was to settle down
 " a new front has been formed in the Samajwadi Party to prevent the return of Amar Singh, a close friend of Mulayam Singh Yadav
 amar singh kii sambhavit vaapasi ko dekhte hue shuukravaar ko sapa ke do dhruv ajam khan or ram gopal apane gile-shikave ko bhulaakar gale mil gaye
 The political corridors that lasted almost an hour have given rise to new speculation
 sapa ke andar khmebandicharcha he ki mulaayam ke dost ko rokane ke liye dushman ek ho gaye hai
 Mulayam's friend Amar Singh is very active these days on his return to the party
 kayaas bhi lagaaya ja rahaa he kiamar singhki party main vaapasi ho sakati he
 Not only this, there is a discussion in the media that Amar Singh can go to Rajya Sabha on SP ticket
 aise main ajam or ramgopal kii mulaakaat ko anti amar front ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Three years later, a meeting between Ram Gopal and Azam was met almost three years later between Azam and Ram Gopal
 ab is mulaakaat ke nihitarth talaashe ja rahe hai
 On Friday, Azam reached the residence of Professor Ram Gopal at Lodhi State in Delhi
 ajam or ramgopal ne saath-saath lunch kiya kareeb ghante bhar tak donon netaa saath rahe
 Some big leaders played a role in closing the distance between the two
 donon netaaon kii baatcheet ke dauraan sapa ke saansad munwwar saleem bhi maujuud the
 This meeting is seen in the context of the return of Amar Singh in Kospam
 july main rajyasabha ke chunaav main amar singh ko pratyaashee banaaya ja saktaa he
 Ram Gopal and Azam are considered the biggest obstacles in Amar's path
 rajyasbhi seat ko lekar charchaaen tejasiyaasi galiyaaron main ye kayaas lagaaye ja rahe hai ki ye sari kavayaden aane vaali 4 july ko upi cote kii 11 rajyasabha siton ke khaali hone ko lekar he
 According to the news, Amar Singh has been nominated for one of the six seats of SP by Supreme Court
 agar sapa supremeo ko party main zyada andruni dabaav kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa to jayaprada bhi rajyasabha pahunch sakati hai
 In such a situation, it will be a big blow for Ram Gopal Yadav and Azam Khan, who are considered to be the biggest opponents of Amar Singh
 jayaprada ne mulaayam kaa pair chhukar liya tha aashirvadhaal hi main amar singh or jayaprada kii vaapasi kii bhoomika shivpal singh yadav ke bete aditya kii shaadi ke din hi tay ho gai thi
 There was some speculation about the way Jayaprada and Amar Singh took part in the marriage ceremony and remained around Mulayam during the entire ceremony
 jayaprada ne to mulaayam kaa pair chhukar aashirwad liya tha

 lambey samay se thap padi kingfisher airlines ke karmchaariyon ko tankhwaah nahin dene kaa mudda company ke chairman vijay maalya ke saamne ek baar phir aa khadaa hua he
 Company employees in an open letter accused Mallya of tarnishing the image of the country, especially the aviation industry
 kingfisher airlines ke ek tatkaaleen karmchaaree kii patni ne apane pati ko vetan kaa bhugtan nahin kiye jane kii vajah se paidaa hue vittiya tanaav ko lekar 4 aktubar, 2012 ko kathith taur par aatmahatya kar lee thi
 The staff said in an open letter, "we have been in constant pain and tension because of your apathy
" haalanki, kingfisher airlines ke bare main aapako ‘koi pachhtaawaa nahin’ hone kii tippanee se hamen adhik pidaa hui he
 Our fishingfisher airlines still exist because we are still on payroll without pay, even though we never received any information from you regarding the salary after you were assured of the company's revival
 ’’bataa den ki maalya ne haal hi main kaha tha, ‘‘mujhe koi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 i only regret that when oil prices are so low, Kingfisher Airlines is not flying
 ’’ There are two incidents in history that reflect the fascination of Tibetan dogs in China
 yah kutton kii vah khoonkhaar nasl he jiske bare main china ke kuch hisson main mahaj itnaa kaha jaataa he, ''yahi vah kutta he jise baandhakar rakhaa janaa chahie
 "one story tells that when the Mongolian ruler Genghis Khan was preparing to enter Europe by crossing the Tibetan plateau, he asked his commanders to prepare an army of 30,000 such dogs
 tibet ke in kutton kiitani khyaati thi ki jab sailaani marco polo yahaan pahunchaa to usne 'sher kii tarah gurraane vaale in kutton' par hairaani jaahir kii thi
 The second incident is recent, but it is like that of a fighter commander who had a different view of this magnificent animal
 jab maao tse tung ne piples libration army (piele) ko korian yuddh main shaamil hone ke liye barf se jam chuki yaalu nadi ko paar karne kaa nirdesh diya to unhone us samay tangahaali ke daur se guzar rahi piele ke liye sardi ke saste kot taiyaar karaane ke vaaste dasiyon hajaar tibeti kutton ko maarane kii manjuuri de di thi
 It is said that Mao killed these dogs, which were seen with great respect for centuries in many parts of China, in one stroke
 desh ke sansthaapak pitamah ke taur par maao jitne lokapriy hai, guao mig ko utana hi gussa aaj bhi in kutton ke sanhaar par he
 The 57-year-old mig, who considers these Tibetan dogs to be no ordinary dogs, says, "mao did this very wrong thing
" '' ve kehete hai, ''inhen kutta kahana vaisaa hi he jaise baagh ko billi kahana
 "this former officer is one of the most important breeders of these giant dogs in China for two decades
" china main paaltu jaanavar rakhana dashakon tak varjit mana jaataa tha
 But when China's growing middle class began to cultivate the trend, the Mig was also one of a dozen farms that emerged in Beijing's suburbs
 varanaa paaltu jaanavar rakhana 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main acolpaneey or boote ke baahar mana jaataa tha or phir maao ke china main ise burjua shauk ke taur par dhikkara jaataa rahaa
 Then, in the 1990s, when a period of reforms began in China, pets started appearing in affluent homes
 par shaharon main sarkaar ne bade kutton ko rakhane kii ijaajat nahin di
 Even today a permit is required to keep a dog in every city and a yearly fee has to be paid which depends on the size of the dog
 isiilie pag, pekingse or shih jus jaise kute aam taur par pasand kiye jate rahe
 But the affluent class wanted something different, so its attention went to the long forgotten Tibetan lambs
 deewangivyavsaayee wang shiyapeng ko apana pehla tibeti kutta tibet ghoomane gaye apane ek dost se tohfe ke taur par 2003 main mila tha
 He says, "he was very different from all the dogs i had seen till now
" '' wang ek lokapriy chini or tibeti kahawat kaa zikr karte hai, ''ek tibeti kutta, nau saamaanya kutton ke baraabar hota he
 The Tibetan dog became a status symbol for affluent Chinese like Wang
 jaise-jaise in kutton kii keemat badhati gai, unke farm bhi failte gaye
 "in 2003, Beijing had fewer than 100 dog farms," says Guao
 aaj beijing ke shunayi jile ke jhaokwanying ilaake main hi kareeb 500 dog farm hai
 "having a Tibetan dog was like a golden egg," says Wang
 mujhe ek aise prajnak kaa pataa he jiske paas khalis nasl kaa ek nar tibeti kutta tha
 She is about one lakh yuan (one million rupees) to provide her to other owners for breeding
 ) letaa tha
 He used to do this 50 to 60 times a year
 dekhte hi dekhte vah karodpati ban gaya
 Wang himself went further to open the dog house in which he raised about 70 giant Tibetan dogs
 in kutton ke maalikon ke nae varg main piele kii second artilari kor—jo darasal mixilon or parmaanu hathiyaaron ko niyantrit karne vaali gupt ikai he—kaa ek afasar bhi tha
 That officer was identified only as Zhang Nam
 use pehla kutta tohfe ke rup main mila tha
 At that time, giving this dog as a gift to influential officials had become a common way of taking advantage
 ise koi apartment yaa nakad rishwat ke rup main dene se kam jokhimpurna mana jaataa tha
 Last year, the acrimony regarding these dogs had reached a peak
 china ke dakshin main ek sampann tateey praant jhejiyang main kutta meley main ek real estate vyavsaayee ne khalis nasl ke do judawaan tibeti kutton ke liye kareeb 140 lakh yuan (lagbhag 14 karod ru
 ) Paid
 guao kehete hai, ''maine sochaa tha ki yah teji kam se kam 20 saal to chalegi par yah bamushkil paanch saal rahi
 "they are still surprised by the rapid change of events
" 2014 ke ant main sarkaar ne sandigdh adhikariyon ko nishaanaa banaate hue bhrashtachar nirodhak abhiyaan chalaaya
 The presence of Tibetan dogs in it was seen as evidence of suspicion for the investigating officers
 anya prajnakon kaa kahana tha ki chini arthvyavastha main mandi ne bhi is utsaah kii hawa nikaal di
 Guao also has another explanation for this
 ve use june main stock market ke girane ke samakaksh maanate hai jiske baad andhadhundh or ataarkik tareeke se sheyaron kii kharid shuru ho gai thi, '' logon ne paanch saal tak jis tarah diwaanon kii bhaanti tibeti kutton kii kharid-farokht kii, uskaa koi tark nahin tha
 "breeders started breeding Tibetan dogs with dogs of every breed in the world, allowing buyers to find Tibetan dogs of a 'unique' type, of strange physical nature
" kuch ke bal alag tarah ke the to kuch ke jabade latake hue
 It was frightening for hobbyists of Tibetan dogs
 ek vikrut bazaar main sabase mazaakia or ajeebogareeb dikhne vaale tibeti kute hi sabase zyada keemat paane lage
 The business of slaughtered Tibetan dogs became so out of control that according to Guao, today Tibetan dogs of purebred species would have remained just one percent of the total population of these dogs in Beijing
 aaj khalis nasl ke tibeti kutton kaa koi mol nahin he
 The puppies never get 50,000 yuan (five lakh rupees)
 ) main beche jate the, ve ab 1,500 yuan (15,000 ru
 )
 prajnak dhandhe se baahar ho gaye hai
 This changing destiny of Tibetan dogs came to mind a few months ago when a team of animal guards stopped a truck carrying over 100 dogs to slaughter

 The dog, once sold for millions, was now being taken to slaughterhouses for meat
 haal hi kii ek dopaher beijing ke shunayi upnagar ke tibeti kutton ke farm main viraani thi
 It was only a few months ago when the highway coming here from Beijing was jammed with traffic as thriving Chinese families used to come here and spend thousands on puppies of Tibetan dogs
 aaj hajaaron kute aise hai jinhen ghar nahin mil rahaa
 Now the intention of trucks coming to these farmhouses is something else
 ve vajan taulne vaali mashiinon or pinjaron se las hote hai

 ''tibeti kute chini sampada hai
 Instead of saving them, we are killing them for meat
 '' guao ko nahin pataa ki tibeti kutton kii phir se khoj or unke patan kii yah kahani kahaan jaakar puri hogi, par unhen behad kharaab sthiti kaa andeshaa he

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has strongly objected to the statement of Congress leader Shashi Tharoor
 party ne kaha ki congress, bhaajapa kaa virodh karte-karte bharat kaa virodh karne lagi he
 The language of Congress and Pakistan has become the same
 bhaajapa pravaktaa pravaktasudhanshu trivedine somvaar ko kaha ki aisi bahut si ghatnaayen hui hai jisamen pakistan or congress saath saath khadey dikhaai dete hai
 Sudhanshu Trivedi said that Pakistan has always opposed India's statement in the United Nations
 shashi tharur kaa bayaan pakistan ke saath khadaa hua dikhaai detaa he
 The Congress should respond to this
 unhen desh se maafee maangani chahie
 He said that not only this, such incidents are happening continuously for some time that the expressions and language of Congress and Pakistan look alike
 pakistan bhi aresas kii aalochana karata he, rahul gandhi bhi aalochana karte hai
 The tone in which Rahul criticizes the Rafael Deal
 usee swar main pakistan bhi aalochana karata he
 Please tell that Shashi Tharoor has said that instead of creating a positive and constructive image of India, Foreign Minister Sushma Swarajka's speech at the United Nations was for BJP voters
 shashi tharur ne kaha ki aisa lagata he ki bharat main sab kuch raajnneetik vaataavaran hi he
 Sudhanshu Trivedi said that it was never India's tradition that any party criticize India's statement in the United Nations
 kyonki sanyukt raashtra main diya gaya vaktavy kisi party kaa nahin balki bharat kaa bayaan vaktavy mana jaataa he
 But the way Shashi Tharoor has raised the question is very unfortunate
 kya boli thim sushamaa swarajdrasal, shanivaar ko videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne sanyukt raashtra kii aamasabha main pakistan ko jamkar gheraa
 He lashed out at Pakistan over the issue of fomenting terrorism, and blamed Islamabad for the failure of the dialogue process between the two countries
 videsh mantri ne sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ke 73wein adhiveshan ko sambodhit karte hue sanyukt raashtra se bharat kii pahal antarrashtriya aatankwaad par vyapak samjhauta ko sheeghra sweekaar karne kii apil kii taaki is vaishvik abhishaap ko spasht shabdon main paribhaashit kiya ja sake kyonki pakistan aatankiyon ko swatantraaa senaanee kahata he

 Actually, this concept was started with the purpose of providing an outdoor living arrangement at affordable prices

 Vishnu Khare is a remarkable poet — almost the poems of "lasani" and "vishnu Khare" extend and position the power of the Hindi language in a wide range of subjects
 '' pehla vaakya kavi kedarnath singh kaa he or doosraa kunwar narayan kaa
 Two of the best poets of our time have found Vishnu Khare's poet eccentric and elaborate, praising him as well as reading them with full enthusiasm
 aazaadee ke baad muktibodh kii parampara ke ve sabase bade kavi hai or apane dhang ke anuthe
 Recently, the collection of Khare's spiritual poems from Setu Prakashan came from the name of Setu Samagra: Kavita / Vishnu Khare
 isaki bhoomika main hamaare samay ke varisht kavi mangalesh dabraal likhte hai: ''kavita ke sansar main aise rachanaakaar hameshaa se kam rahe hai, jinhone kavita main prasthaapana-parivartan kiya or kavita ke itihaas main bhi badlaav kiya
 "this is the first sentence of this role
" hindi kavita kaa itihaas koi chota-motaa itihaas nahin
 He is also a history of Hindi society and Hindi caste
 samay or samaaj ne jaise-jaise karavat badali, kaviyon ne use apni kavita main darj kiya
 From the bard-bhat period to the period of liberalization
 1972 kii aalochana main chhapi teble kavita se khare ne hindi kavita ke mizaaj ko badalanaa shuru kiya or saatven sangrah or anya kavitaayen tak aate-aate kavita ke itihaas main badlaav kar daale
 He converted the poem into language of common man's anger
 aakrosh kii abhivyakti main hi unki kavitaayen gadhymay hoti gayi
 Sometimes, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla wrote for the poem, "just as the liberation of the soul is called Gyanadha, similarly the liberation of the heart is called as Logasha
 '' kahaan hriday he or kahaan aatma, yah sawaal jane bhi den to is kathy main rasadasha or gyanadasha kii baat kahi gai he
 In Khare's poem, there is a coincidence of both intellect and heart, like the sensory sensation in Muktibodh's words
 unki kai kavitaayen ek taraf sochane ko vivash karti hai to duusari taraf rone ko, thik maar kha roi nahin kii tarah
 His daughter poem is not written on his daughter
 uskaa pehla vaakya dekhie: jane se pehle usne kaha / apni beti samajhakar hi mujhe rakh lijie
 And the last bond is: "morning goes out again my thousands of daughters / For a troubled, scared, humiliated hope / In search of a father who is different from his real fathers / Who does not consider them worthy of the daughter, keep it
" yah kavita 'buland bharat' kii dayaneey tasviir dikhalaati he
 Another poem of Khare sees the horrifying truth of our time: vultures and eagles sitting on stumps looking down at the dead of bodies / From the gizzard of cuckoos, tariffs, peacocks, thistles / flames and screams / those flags
 But sitting on them scrape them
 mahabharat ke samay kaa aadhunik varjan maani jane vaali is lambii kavita kaa ansh hamen batalaata he ki ham aise samay main ji rahe hai / jahaan giddh gharon main ghus aate hai or ham chilla tak nahin sakate
 Khare is accused of writing poetry in prose
 mahavir prasad dvivedi kaa ek kathan he, ''gadhy or padya donon main kavita ho sakati he
 Many of Khare's poems are prose poems
 ye lambey samay tak apane thos gadhy or kahaneepan ke saath pathakon ke paas bani rahati hai
 The reader may feel annoyed but cannot deny their presence
 khare ke paas nakaar kii bhashaa he lekin yah nakaar isi samay kii dein he
 This negation stems from the discomfort of not doing anything
 is nakaar kii vajah se unki bhashaa adhik jatil ho sakati thi lekin unke laalityamay gadhy ne ise bachaa liya
 The use of so many lyrical prose in poetry is typical of Vishnu Khare
 iske liye unki kavitaayen yaad kii jaaengi
 *** kya aapane kabhi sapane main bhi sochaa he ki koi ek saans main 873 kaa pahaada suna de, 7347 kaa pahaada suna de, keval aath minute main ganit ke bahut kathin 200 calculation ko hal kar de
 It has been made possible by small (5-13 years) children
 yah naammumkin karnama abekas kii calculation vidhi se sambhav hua he
 One such competition showing the expertise of calculus was organized by UCMAS at St
 Columbus School in Delhi, in which more than 3000 children from different schools of Delhi participated
 13veen useemaas dilli pratiyogita ke aayojak rajeev garg ne kaha, "bacchon kii dimagi kshamta ko nikhaarane or dimag ko badhaane kii prakriya paanch saal se shuru ho jaati he
 At this age, their learning process is very fast and if we try to increase the ability of children to think, understand, remember and concentration, then it helps them a lot in life
 " Information about child protection schemes will be in the books of NCERT unhone kaha, "useemaas abekas paddati bacchon main calculation karne kii kshamta ko tej karata he, jisase ve kathin se kathin calculation ko seconds main hal kar dete hai vah bhi bina calculator kaa upyog kiye
 We develop a skill in these children, who are always with them

 Significantly, Uddhav himself came to Delhi this week when the matter was officially put on behalf of the party
 shivasena vidhayak pratap sarnaik ne maharashtra vidhansabha main yah maang rakhi he ki pradhanmantri ke sarkari kaaryakramon main unke sarvocch netaa uddhav thakare kaa yathochit sammaan hona chahie or isliye uddhav thakare ko pradhanmantri ke bagalvaali kursi par hi bithaaya jaae
 Significantly, this demand was being raised by Shiv Sena when Uddhav Thackeray was visiting New Delhi with his son Aditya
 upree taur par shivasena ne is daure ko notebandi ke parinaamon kii charchaa ke liye bataaya
 Despite this, Uddhav Thackeray spoke to Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley instead of meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who announced demonetisation
 tippaniyan The Shiv Sena has been complaining that whenever the Prime Minister had a program in Mumbai before this, party chief Uddhav Thackeray was not placed next to him
 phir chaahe wo dow
 Be it Bhoomi Poojan ceremony of Ambedkar Memorial or inauguration program of Make in India
 ab party ko dar sata rahaa he ki kahin aane vaale dinon main pradhanmantri ke haathon hone ja rahe mumbai metro ke agle charan ke bhoomi pujan ke niojit kaarykram main bhi protocol ke chalate uddhav thakare ko darshakon kii pankti main bithaaya jaae

 gauratlab he ki shivasena kii taraf se ye maang tab uthaai ja rahi thi jab uddhav thakare apane bete aditya ke saath nai dilli ke daure par the
 On the upside, Shiv Sena termed the visit to discuss the consequences of demonetisation
 baavjood iske uddhav thakare ne notebandi kaa elaan karanevaale pradhanmantri narendra modi se milane ke bajaae grahamantri rajnath singh or vitt mantri arun jetali se mulaaqaat kar apni baat rakhi
 The comments shivasena kii ye shikaayat rahi he ki is se pehle jab bhi pradhanmantri ke mumbai main kaarykram hue tab party pramukh uddhav thakare ko unke bagal main bithaaya nahin gaya
 Whether he is Dr
 ambedkar memorial kaa bhoomi pujan samaaroh ho yaa mek in india ke udghaatan kaa kaarykram
 Now the party is afraid that in the coming days, Uddhav Thackeray should be put in the queue due to protocol in the planned schedule of Bhoomi Pujan of the next phase of Mumbai Metro, which is going to be in the hands of the Prime Minister
 gyaat ho ki protocol ke anusaar mahaj kisi dal ke mukhiya ko pradhanmantri ke bagal main jagah nahin di ja sakati
 On the other hand, Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari, while talking to NDTV India, has taken a dig at the lobbying done by the Shiv Sena
 bhandari poochhate hai ki har din pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa virodh karte shivasena party pramukh uddhav thakare ko unke bagal vaali kursi paane ke liye itani jaddojahad kyon kerani pad rahi he ye unhen khud sochna chahie

 If Hajira Bi, who lives with her handicapped son in this colony of gas victims, will listen to her own words, then understand what the pain really is? Hajira explains how this gasp made her sick forever and the family Many slept forever to death
 hajira ke mutabik gas kaa unke parivaar ke logon par aisa asar hua ki ek-ek karke sabhi log biimaar padate gaye or duniya se rukhsat hote chale gaye
 Now the money spent in the name of compensation, the expenses of the house remained far away, now even medicines do not come
 hajira bataati hai ki kaise gascand ke baad unki sehat ne maano unase dushmani kar lee
 Many diseases caught him

 Resham Bai's eyes are not the only victim of Bhopala Gasatrasadi, but one of the thousands of victims who live in the area of bhopal where the poisonous gas from Union Carbide caused the most havoc
 60 saal kii resham bai bhi unamem se ek hai
 Poisonous gas snatched her husband, son and granddaughter from them
 gas risaav ke baad pehle to sab biimaar pade or ek-ek karke maut ke munh main samaa gaye the
 Not only this, Resham Bai's eyes have also become almost in a state of absence due to the effect of gas
 vaise inhone jo dekha uske baad inke paas dekhne ke liye kuch bachaa hi nahin
 Resham Bai tells how her eyes started to deteriorate after the gas leak and the problem is still increasing every day

 Due to this, gas sufferers are dying on the day of illness
