 With the CAG report being presented in the Lok Sabha, the Sheila government's problems have increased
 sieji report main seedbluji ko lekar shila sarkaar par kai sawaal khadey kiye gaye hai
 Delhi BJP is now seeking his resignation
 seedbluji ghotaale par pradhanmantri dwaara banaai gai shungalu cameti report, sivisi report or sieji report
 She came one after the other and these three reports put Sheela Dixit in the dock
 teenon report alag-alag tarah se kaamanwealth ghotaalon kaa pardaafash karti hai
 But one thing is common among the three reports that the role of Sheila Dixit government has been questioned
 kaamanwealth khelon ke dauraan, dilli kii sadako par aapane dekhi hongi chamchamati hui street lits, sadakon ke kinare hariyaali, bade bade khelon ke sin bords, sadakon ke kinare lage pathar ke lamp, tiles, zamin par lage grenite pathar or flani overs
 But behind this glowing glow, the dark truth of scams is also hidden
 sivisi kii report ne khulaasa kiya ki kis tarah kaamanwealth main ghatiya darje kaa kaam zyaada paise dekar karaayaa gaya
 The cvc's Wing Chief Technical Examination investigated that the Commonwealth structure's works were ignored in the tender rules
 construction main ghatiya material kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 In this, questions were raised on the quality of Barapula, Ghazipur fly over and Naraina fly over
 sivisi ke eks kamishnar ne kaha tha ki dilli sarkaar ne unase kaha kaamanwealth se jude kaamon kii koi vizilens kii koi jaanch naa ho
 The Shunglu Committee report also accused Sheila Dixit government of damaging the government treasury
 dilli sarkaar ne kaamanwealth khelon main nigaraanee kaa kaam thik se nahin kiya
 The Delhi government centralized the decisions, which resulted in a loss of Rs 900 crore
 shila dikshit sarkaar ne samay se kaam nahin karavaaya
 And later spent a hurry in a hurry
 sutron ke mutabik sieji report main bhi shila sarkaar par tamaam bade sawaal khadey kiye gaye hai
 During the Commonwealth, there were reports daily that work was being delayed
 lekin ab ye saamne aa rahaa he ki kaam main jaanboojh kar deree kii ja rahi thi, taaki manamaane dhang se kamai kii ja sake

 aajtak
 in on
 hamaari aaj kii raajnneeti bevajaah aakraamak hoti ja rahi he
 The aggression in the language of the leaders has become that of the anchor, it is now becoming the people on the streets
 tarah tarah kii phizul kii dharmik or jaateey senaaon ke bharose raajnneeti apni aakanksha zaahir karegi to phir aupchaarik dalon kaa kya hoga, unhen yah bhi soch lenaa chahie
 Nowadays, in every party, such big leaders will be found who have their own army and they will get such armies which many leaders of each party give their blessings
 itihaas ke nayakon ke naam par aisi yatraaen nikalati hai or loktantr ko samantvaad kaa adda banaaya ja rahaa he
 These days, the news of such beautiful journeys comes from anywhere, which was not even heard before
 in yatraaon main shaamil hokar saansad yaa vidhayak yaa hone vaala saansad yaa vidhayak apni saamaajik or dharmik pahchaan kaayam karata he
 Many times we find it so common that we do not care that the forces in the name of caste, the army in the name of religion, the army in the name of historical heroes are interfering wrongly in your social life
 takaraav paidaa kar rahi hai
 If you are so fond of history, then take admission in the subject of history in a neighborhood college, do not confuse the honor of history by making an idol
 logon ko paanch rupee dawa ke nahin milte hai or ham itihaas ke sammaan ke naam par hazaron karod kii murtiyon banaate hai or shobhaa yatraaen nikaalte hai
 Politics is fooling you in their name, not teaching history
 pravachan dene kii prerana aajkal ke netaaon ke bhaashan se hi mili he jo raajnneeti kii baat kam, naitik shiksha tip ke bhaashan zyaada dene lage hai
 If you want to simplify, then you can say that UP has become uncontrollable
 nae mukhyamantri yogi se sanbhal nahin rahaa he
 Simplification must have started in the part of the media where the news of their decision to wake up day after night and meet at midnight was coming
 nai sarkaar ke baad zarur kuch ghatnaayen aisi hui hai jisase sanket acha nahin ja rahaa he magar upi ke kai hisson main shanti bhi he or thik thaak hi chal rahaa he
 We had decided that if we punished the execution, the incidence of rape would be reduced
 saaf or sakht sandesh jayega
 But it did not happen
 iske liye doshi faansee kii sazaa nahin he, doshi sarkaar bhi nahin he, naitik zimmedaari zarur banati he uski, lekin kuch to he, ham is samasya kii buniyaad par baat nahin karnaa chaahate
 Jewar is a place in Greater Noida, near the Yamuna Expressway
 vahaan buudhvaar raat jo ghatana hui he wo sarkaar se sawaal to puuchhati he, samaaj se bhi puuchhati he
 Six armed goons stopped a car on Yamuna Expressway near Sabouta village
 ghatana raat dedh se dhai ke bich hui he
 There were eight people in this car who were going from Jewar to Bulandshahr
 lutpaat kaa parivaar ke mukhiya shakeel kuraishi ne virodh kiya to unhen goli maar di
 At first the goons were shooting Shakeel's children but when Shakeel pleaded, they released the children and shot Shakeel
 mahilaon ke tupatton se purushon ko baandh kar unhen ulta lataka diya
 Then the four women were taken down to the farm and gang raped
 shakeel or unka parivaar itani raat ko yatra isliye kar rahaa tha ki unke kisi rishtedaar kii delivery honi thi
 Both mother and child were in danger
 isliye puraa parivaar bhaag kar unki madad ke liye ja rahaa tha
 Police arrived an hour after the incident
 ek ghante ke bheetar aparaadhiyon ne kisi or parivaar kii zindagi bachaane nikle ek parivaar kii zindagi tabah kar di
 a similar incident took place on the Delhi Kanpur highway in Bulandshahr district at 2
30 am daily on 31 July 2016
 ek parivaar noida se shahjahanpur ke liye niklaa kyonki use ek antyeshti main shaamil hona tha
 Husband wife, two daughters and two male relatives were in the car
 paanch chah daakuon ne car roak lee
 The 45-year-old woman and the 15-year-old were taken off the car and raped her
 is dauraan baaki parivaaravaalon ko bandook kii nok par bandhak banaae rakhaa
 At that time, many channels did a highway type program of how safe UP is
 dabaav bhi bana or suraksha ke intazaam bhi kiye hi gaye honge
 Then the leaders had said that there is Gunda Raj in UP
 raaj to badal gaya magar gunde nahin badale hai
 The culprits were caught within 24 hours but the crime trend has not stopped
 jab express ve or haive surakshit nahin honge to raat biraat apaat sthiti main jane vaale pariwaron ke saath kya hoga, isaki guarantee koun legaa
 It is also not true that there is no police car on the highway
 hoti he
 Even then events do happen
 hive police der se pahunchati he
 Politics has no effect on crime in the event of crime
 jis rajya main sarkaar banate hi police adhikariyon ke peetane kii khabar aane lage us rajya main aparaadhiyon kaa manobal tuutane main thodaa to vakt lag saktaa he
 Although the incidents of beating of officers have stopped, the political and social character of Uttar Pradesh cannot change overnight
 kaise badalanaa chahie is par zarur baat kiijie
 bjp's city president in Moorabadabad, he has been arrested
 kyon kiya gaya he kyonki nagar adhyaksh ji kisi kii shikaayat lekar thane gaye, shikaayat le lee gai, magar jab karrwai kaa aashwaasan mila to bhaajapa netaa asantusht ho gaye
 It is alleged that Netaji scrambled with the police station officer at the Thakurdwara police station, in which the policeman was injured in the fight, which has been medically taken
 inspector kii kursi ke baraabar baithkar yah kehete sune gaye hai ki daaroga ko juute maarenge, thane ke baahar police kii pitayee hogi, or jab pitayee hogi to dekhte hai koun mantri bachaane aate hai
 Lyricist Javed Akhtar should be arrested for not writing a good script for such a talented city president
 kair, police ko sudhaarney ke nagar adhyaksh ke is mahaan kaary main madad ke liye bhaajapa ziladhyaksh bhi aa gaye
 When our correspondent Anwar spoke to the CO or the jurisdictional officer, the name of the political party was not taken from him
 kehete rahe kisi raajnneetik dal ne shikaayat kii thi
 We understand their fear, respect their practicality, because of a statement, the transfer will go away and i do not know what it is that does not seem appropriate
 aap video ke zariye kuch andaaza kiijie ki vahaan kya hua hoga, ek beep sound sunai degi, iskaa matlab he us jagah par aisi gaaliyaan di gayi hai jise ham tivi par nahin suna sakate
 It is a matter of research that the government belongs to BJP, yet why the city president had to go for an FIR with so many people
 agar unki ye sthiti he to phir desh bhar ke thanon ko lekar bahes kiijie jahaan exiaar karana bhi ek jhamele se kam nahin he
 a fake FIR is a different subject
 nagar adhyaksh ko marpet ke aarope main giraftaar bhi kiya gaya lekin thane se hi zamaanat mil gai
 City President, a humble request is to keep the anger under control
 daaroga amit sharma ke saath jo hua uske liye khed vyakt karen
 Regarding the law, everyone knows that it does its job
 muradabad ke artio karyaalay ke baahar 9 may ko bijepi or banjrang dal ke log aapas main is baat ko lekar ulajh gaye ki fitness checking ke liye aane vaali gadiyon ke liye medical kit koun bechega
 Fencing was also demonstrated on both sides for this
 bhartiya samskruti ke in pratikon kaa istamaal sirf itihaas ko lekar daraane ke kaam main hi nahin, medical kit bechney ke kaam main bhi laayaa ja saktaa he, yah gyaan mujhe itihaas kii kaksha main nahin balki is video footage se praapt hua he
 Traditional weapons like lathi poles were also used
 pathar bhi chale hai magar yah gyaat nahin hua ki pathar chalaane kii prerana kashmir se mili he yaa local hi kisi se mil gai he
 And yes, the 7 round shot is also fired
 iskaa matlab donon paksh paaramparik ke saath saath aadhunik yuddh kaushal main bhi daksh rahe honge
 Think this performance of Shaurya has taken place on the contract to install medical kit in heavy vehicles
 raashtra nirmaan main theke kaa role kitna mahatvapurn he aap samaj rahe honge
 After this, the police team of independent India arrived with the force, the fighters had fled
 is maamle main giraftaar bhi hui he
 The Bajrang Dal and the BJP can also shoot at each other, not even the poets like Ashok Vajpayee and Kedarnath Singh in their poetry
 aap soch rahe honge ki kanoon vyavastha kii in karaabiyon ko lekar main krodhit tevar ke saath ankaring kyon nahin kar rahaa hum
 Now in this way, we will see someone firing, if you enter the police station and kill them, then it will be time to keep calm
 pakistan kii baat hoti to vahaan ke saare generalon, senadhyakshon ko lalkaar detaa kyonki mujhe apni sena par bharosa he ki wo inhen studio tak pahunchane hi nahin degi
 Police is also trusted, but this labor is not trusted
 isiilie hamaare ankar log pakistan par zyaada dhyaan dete hai
 We are talking about U
P
 phirozabad main mantri ji mil gaye, parivahan mantri, ghatana ke bare main pataa nahin magar karrwai kya hogi uske bare main zordaar bayaan diya he
 After this, you will also hear the statement of law and order minister Ram Pati which he has given in Unnao
 zamin main jaaenge yaa maare jaaenge
 It is good to make such extreme statements that the systems are corrected, where the police is better and no leader is killed
 puure desh main thane raajnneeti kaa adda ban gaye hai
 Why does one have to go with hundred people to get an FIR done
 iske alaava is baat par bhi sochiye upi main aisa kyon ho rahaa he
 Why are the communities clashing with each other somewhere? kyon saharanpur kii hinsa tham nahin rahi he
 Why there are many tensions in Aligarh
 kya zaruri he ki har ghatana ko saamaajik ahan kaa sawaal bana diya jaae, jaateey ahankaar kaa sawaal bana diya jaae
 Why are people so angry? saharanpur kii hinsa par grih mantralay ne report maangi he
 Four companies of Rapid Action Force have been sent from the center
 5 may se vahaan tarah tarah ke jhagade ho rahe hai
 First, there was tension about Ambedkar Jayanti's procession, then there was tension about Maharana Pratap Jayanti's Shobha Yatra
 kai logon ne kaha ki upi main maharana pratap jayanti kii shobhaa yatra pehle nahin suni
 Similarly, many types of trips have started coming out from time to time
 tanaav ke kaarnon par bahes ho sakati he, lekin is hinsa main ek se adhik logon kii jaan ja chuki he, kai log ghayal hai or kai log jail main hai
 Even after this, the violence is not stopping
 kya is hinsa ke baad raajnneetik hisaab hona he, kiskaa vot kise milegaa, kya itani si baat saharanpur kii janata nahin samajhati he ki ve shant rahen, kya unke bich koi nahin he jo is ladaai ko band karawaaye
 Somewhere there is Jatav versus Thakur and somewhere it is Balmiki versus Muslim
 is hinsa kii buniyaad ko samajhnaa hoga, kya koi ek varg satta milane se zyaada utsahit he, kya kisi ek varg ko lag rahaa he ki satta uski he
 So the solution lies in the behavior of the government as well as in the society
 samaaj ko bhi thodaa sudharna hoga or wo sudhaar satta se behatar koi nahin kar saktaa
 In the news of violence and confrontation, it is not just Hindus vs Muslims, Jatavs vs Rajputs, somewhere there are Rajputs vs Muslims and somewhere Hindus vs Hindus
 jharkhand main to gautam gunjan or gangesh ko bhi bheed ne maar diya
 We have to think that this political aggression of waste can be a formula to win elections and not to live
 upi hi kyon, aap bengal dekh lijie, baat baat main takaraav he, baat baat main hinsa he
 There has also been a demand to send companies of Rapid Action Force there
 mukhyamantriyon se istife kii maang kii raajnneeti to hoti rahegi, pehle apane saamaajik rishton kaa khyaal kiijie, unhen bigadane mat dijie
 Thakurs of Keshopur Jafri village reached the police station and said that we will adopt Islam
 vidhayak ne bhi inhen samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 People of Thakur caste had complained that they have been harassed and people of Jatav society are talking about conversion
 jab unhen islam main nyaay mil rahaa he to ham bhi dharm parivartan karenge
 The people of Dalit society said that they are changing their religion and they put pictures of their deities in the pond
 aarope yah laga ki thakur samaaj ne apni ek naalee jatvon ke mohalle kii taraf khol di
 There was a confrontation against it
 police ne donon pakshon ke logon ke khilaaf maamla to darj kar liya he lekin kya ziladhikari ko jaakar nahin dekhnaa chahie ki kisi mohalle kii taraf naalee kholi gai he yaa nahin
 If opened, it should be closed
 is khabar ke or bhi pahalu honge jo samay kii kami ke kaaran ham nahin bataa rahe hai lekin donon samaaj kii yah zid bataa rahi he ki baat se jitani samasya nahin he utani mohabbat apni apni zid se he
 That is why i am saying why i am so angry with each other
 25 may ko aligarh ke ek ilaake main drone camere se nigaraanee kii gai
 Police is finding out from drone camera that there is something wrong
 ek hafte ke bheetar do samudaay do baar aamane saamne aa gaye
 What was the matter, the child of the Balmiki community got injured on the bike of the youth of the Muslim community
 is baat ko lekar jhagada do samudaayon ke bich ban gaya, agar police nahin sambhalati to na jane kitne logon kii jaan chali jaati
 The comments ab sochiye ki vaaki logon ke paas itani fursat he ki baat baat main itani ladaai ho rahi he
 After all, why has the trust of one society become so low that the tragic incident with one becomes the question of the whole community
 aap sochiye ye saamaanya sthiti nahin he
 Chief Minister Yogi may be accountable but circumstances are arising in your neighborhood
 police bhi soch rahi he lekin police ko or bhi kaam he
 It is not that between these reports of crime and confrontation, the attendance of Romans in the school college has increased to 100%
 samaaj main unke baahar dekhe jane kii sambhaavna abhi bhi he
 So the police is taking training to catch these Romeo
 mathura main vyapaariyon kii hatya hui, paanch karod kii lut hui thi to usee police ne pakadaa bhi, pataa nahin un logon kaa kya hua jinhone agra main police waalon par hamale kiye the
 At least the UP Police should give a status report on the attacks on its soldiers and officers that in these cases it is a bit fast and action has been taken
 taaki logon ko bharosa mili ki kam se kam police ko mat chhedo
 Do you know what happened to the mob that had entered the house of Luv Kumar, the SSP in Saharanpur,? unka tabadalaa kar diya gaya, lav kumaar kii jagah jo esaspi aae ab unka bhi tabadalaa ho chukaa he
 Amidst all these situations, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said in the assembly that there is no place for criminals in the state
 aaj kal har dal main aise bade netaa mil jaaenge jinaki apni phizul kii sena he or aisi senaayen mil jaaengi jinhen har dal ke kai netaa apana aashirwad dete hai
 Such visits originate in the name of heroes of history and democracy is being made the base of feudalism
 in dinon kahin se bhi aisi shobhaa yatraaon ke nikalne kii khabar aa jaati he jinke bare main pehle suna tak nahin gaya
 By joining these visits, the MP or MLA or the incoming MP or MLA establishes his social and religious identity
 kai baar hamen yah sab itnaa saamaanya lagata he ki ham parvaah hi nahin karte ki jaat ke naam par senaayen, dharm ke naam par senaayen, aitihaasik naiyakon ke naam par senaayen aapke saamaajik jivan main galat hastkshep kar rahi hai
 Causing conflict
 itihaas kaa itnaa hi shauk he to pados ke kisi college main itihaas vishay main admician lijie, murti banaakar itihaas kaa sammaan karne kaa bhram mat paaliye
 People do not get five rupees for medicine and we make thousands of crores of idols in the name of honoring history and taking out Shobha Yatras
 inke naam par raajnneeti aapako murkh bana rahi he, itihaas nahin padhaa rahi he
 The inspiration to give discourse has come from the speeches of today's leaders, who have started giving less talk of politics, more types of moral education
 agar sarleekaran karnaa ho to kah sakate hai ki upi bekaabu ho gaya he
 The new Chief Minister has not been able to handle Yogi
 media ke jis hisse main unke din raat jag kar aadhi raat ko meeting kar faisle lene kii khabaren aa rahi thim vahaan bhi sarleekaran shuru ho gaya hoga
 After the new government, there have been some incidents that are not giving a good signal but there is peace in many parts of UP and it is going well
 hamane yah tay kar liya tha ki faansee kii sazaa denge to balaatkaar kii ghatana kam ho jaaegi
 Clean and strong message will be sent
 lekin nahin hua
 For this, there is no punishment for the guilty, there is not even a guilty government, but moral responsibility is definitely made, but there is something, we do not want to talk on the basis of this problem
 greater noida main jevar ek jagah he yumna express ve ke paas
 The incident that happened there on Wednesday night asks the government questions, it also asks the society
 sabauta gaanv ke paas yamuna express ve par hathiyaarband chah gundon ne ek car roak lee
 The incident took place between one and a half to two and a half nights
 is car main aath log the jo jevar se bulandshahr ja rahe the
 The robbery protested by family head Shakeel Qureshi when he was shot
 pehle gunde shakeel ke bacchon ko goli maar rahe the lekin jab shakeel ne minnat kii to bacchon ko chhod diya or shakeel ko goli maar di
 The men were tied up by the women's trunks and hung upside down
 phir chaaron mahilaon ko utaar kar khet main le gaye or gang rape kiya
 Shakeel and his family were traveling on such a night that their relatives had to be delivered
 jaccha or baccha donon khatare main the
 So the whole family ran away to help them
 police ghatana ke ek ghante baad pahunchi
 Within an hour, the criminals destroyed the life of one family who came out to save the life of another family
 31 july 2016 ke rose dhai baje tadake bulandshahr zile main dilli kanpur haive par aisi hi ghatana hui thi
 a family left from Noida for Shahjahanpur as he was to attend a funeral
 us car main pati patni, do betiyaan or do purush rishtedaar savaar the
 Five six bandits stopped the car
 45 saal kii mahila or 15 saal kii mahila ko car se utaar kar le gaye or unke saath balaatkaar kiya
 During this, the rest of the family was held hostage at gunpoint
 us samay kai channelon ne kitna surakshit he upi kaa haive tip kaarykram kiya
 Pressure was also created and security arrangements must have been made
 tab netaaon ne kaha tha ki upi main gunda raaj he
 The rule has changed but the goons have not changed
 apradhi 24 ghante ke andar pakade gaye the magar aparaadh kii pravriti nahin thami he
 When the expressway and the highway are not safe, then who will guarantee what will happen to the families going into emergency overnight
 yah bhi sahi nahin he ki haive par police kii car nahin hoti he
 it occurs
 phir bhi ghatnaayen hoti hai
 Highway police arrive late
 aparaadh kii ghatana par raajnneeti se aparaadh par koi asar nahin padataa he
 It may take some time for the morale of criminals to break in the state where the news of beating of police officers started coming soon
 haalanki ab adhikariyon ke peetane kii ghatnaayen band ho gayi hai lekin uttar pradesh kaa raajnneetik or saamaajik charitra raaton raat to nahin badal saktaa he
 Talk about how it should change
 murabadabaad main bhaajapa ke nagar adhyaksh hai, unhen giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Why has it been done because the city president went to the police station with someone's complaint, the complaint was taken, but when the assurance of action was received, the BJP leaders became dissatisfied
 aarope he ki netaa ji ne thakurdwara thane main tainaat daaroga se hathapayee kii, is marpet main daaroga ji ko chotein ain hai, jiskaa medical kara liya gaya he
 Sitting equal to the inspector's chair, he is heard saying that the policeman will be beaten up, the police will be beaten outside the police station, and when the beating is done, we see who comes to save the minister
 itane pratibhashali nagar adhyaksh ke liye badhiya script na likhane ke aarope main geetkaar javed akhtar ko giraftaar kar lenaa chahie
 Anyway, the BJP District Magistrate also came to help in this great task of improving the police
 jab hamaare samvaadadaata anwar ne sio yani kshetradhikari se baat kii to unase raajnneetik dal kaa naam bhi nahin liya gaya
 Some political party kept saying that they had complained
 ham unka dar samajhate hai, unke vyaavhaarik hone kaa sammaan karte hai, ek bayaan ke chalate transfar jhelo or pataa nahin kya jhelo, uchit nahin lagata he
 Through the video, you can guess what happened there, a beep sound will be heard, that means there are abuses at that place which we cannot hear on TV
 yah baat shodh kaa vishay he ki sarkaar bijepi kii he phir bhi nagar adhyaksh ko itane logon ke saath exiaar ke liye kyon janaa padaa
 If this is their situation, then debate about the police stations across the country, where FIR is also not less than a mess
 farji exiaar to alag vishay he
 The city president was also arrested on charges of assault but got bail from the police station itself
 nagar adhyaksh ji, savinay nivedan he ki gusse ko kaabo main rakhen
 Daroga sorry for what happened to Amit Sharma
 rahi baat kanoon kii to sabko pataa he yah apana kaam karata he
 On 9 May, outside the RTO office of Moradabad, the BJP and Banjrang Dal people got involved in the matter of who would sell the medical kit for the trains coming for fitness checking
 is baat ke liye donon pakshon main talwarbazi kaa bhi pradarshan hua
 These symbols of Indian culture can be used not only to scare history, but also to sell medical kits, this knowledge i have gained from this video footage but not in the history class
 lathi danda jaise paaramparik hathiyaaron kaa bhi istamaal hua
 The stones have also gone, but it is not known whether the inspiration to run the stone has been received from Kashmir or the local has met someone
 or haa, 7 round goli bhi chali he
 This means both sides must have been skilled in traditional as well as modern combat skills
 sochiye shaury kaa yah pradarshan baari vaahanon main medical kit lagane ke theke ko lekar hua he
 You must understand how important the role of contracts is in nation building
 iske baad azaad bharat kii police dal bal ke saath pahunchi tab tak ladane vaale bhaag chuke the
 An arrest has also been made in this case
 bajrang dal or bhaajapa bhi aapas main goli baari kar sakate hai isaki kalpana ashok vaajapeyi or kedarnath singh jaise libral kaviyon ne bhi apni kavita main nahin kii he
 You must be wondering why i am not anchoring with an angry attitude about these law and order problems
 ab is tarah se kisi ko goli chalaate dekhenge, thane main ghus kar maarthe dekhenge to shant rahanaa hi samyaanukool hoga
 Talking about Pakistan, all the generals and army chiefs would have been challenged because i trust my army that they will not allow them to reach the studio
 police par bhi bharosa he magar is lever kaa bharosa nahin he
 That is why our anchor people pay more attention to Pakistan
 ham upi kii baat kar rahe hai
 Minister met in Firozabad, Transport Minister does not know about the incident but has given a strong statement about what will be the action
 iske baad kanoon vyavastha ke mantri ram pati ji kaa bhi bayaan suniyegaa jo unhone unnav main diya he
 Will go to the ground or be killed
 is tarah ke ugr bayanon se acha he ki vyavasthaaon ko thik kiya jaae, jahaan police bhi behatar ho or police ko koi netaa maare bhi na
 Police stations have become the hub of politics all over the country
 ek exiaar karaane ke liye kisi ko sau logon ke saath kyon janaa padataa he
 Apart from this, also think on why this is happening in UP
 kyon kahin sampradaay to kahin samudaay aapas main bhide hue hai
 Why the violence in Saharanpur has not stopped
 kyon aligarh main bhaanti bhaanti ke tanaav hai
 What is important is that every incident should be made a question of social arrogance, a question of ethnic arrogance
 itnaa gussa kyon he logon main
 The Home Ministry has sought a report on the violence in Saharanpur
 centre se rapid ection force kii chaar companiyaan vahaan bheji gai hai
 Since May 5, there have been various fights
 pehle ambedkar jayanti kii shobhaayatra ko lekar tanaav hua, phir maharana pratap jayanti kii shobhaa yatra ko lekar tanaav hua
 Many said that Maharana Pratap Jayanti's Shobha Yatra in UP was not heard before
 isi tarah kai tarah kii yatraaen samay samay par nikalne lagi hai
 The reasons for the tension can be debated, but more than one person has died in this violence, many people are injured and many are in jail
 iske baad bhi hinsa nahin ruk rahi he
 Is there any political calculation after this violence, who will get their vote, does not the people of Saharanpur understand that they should remain calm, is there no one among them who should stop this fight
 kahin jatav banaam thakur he to kahin balmiki banaam muslim he
 The basis of this violence has to be understood, is any one class more excited than getting power, is any one class feeling that the power belongs to them
 to iskaa samaadhaan sarkaar ke vyavhaar main bhi he or samaaj main bhi he
 Society will also have to improve a little and no one can do better than that in power
 hinsa or takaraav kii khabaron main sirf hindu banaam muslim nahin hai, jatav banaam rajput hai to kahin rajput banaam muslim hai to kahin hindu banaam hindu hai
 In Jharkhand, Gautam Gunjan and Gangesh were also killed by the mob
 hamen yah sochna hoga ki phaltu kii yah raajnneetik aakraamakata chunaav jeetne kaa formula ho sakati he, jeene kaa nahin
 Why UP, you see Bengal, there is a conflict in the matter, there is violence in the matter
 vahaan bhi rapid ection force kii companiyaan bhejne kii maang hui he
 The politics of demanding resignation from the Chief Ministers will continue, first consider your social relationships, do not let them deteriorate
 keshopur jaafaree gaanv ke thakur log thane pahunch gaye or kaha ki ham islam apana lenge
 The MLA also tried to explain them
 thakur jati ke logon kii shikaayat thi ki unke saath utpeedan hua he or jatav samaaj ke log dharm parivartan karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 When they are getting justice in Islam, we will also convert
 dalit samaaj ke logon ne kaha ki apana dharm badal rahe hai or unhone apane devi devataaon kii tasviren talab main pravaahit kar deen
 The allegation was that the Thakur society opened a drain on the Jatavs' locality
 iske virodh main takaraav ho gaya
 The police have registered a case against the people of both the sides, but should the District Magistrate not go and see if the drain has been opened to any locality
 kholi gai he to use band karnaa chahie
 There will be other aspects of this news which we are not telling due to lack of time, but the stubbornness of both the society is telling that love is not as much problem as it is with its own stubbornness
 tabhi main kah rahaa hum ki itnaa gussa ek duusare ko lekar kyon he
 On 25 May, drone cameras were monitored in an area of aligarh
 police drone camere se pataa laga rahi he ki kahin kuch gadabad to nahin he
 Two communities came face to face twice within a week
 maamla kya tha, balmiki samudaay ke bachche kaa accident muslim samudaay ke yuvak kii bike se ho gaya
 a quarrel between the two communities became about this matter, if the police did not handle, then many people would have lost their lives
 tippaniyan Now think that people really have so much time that so much fighting is going on
 aakhir ek samaaj kaa duusare samaaj par bharosa itnaa kam kyon ho gaya he ki ek ke saath kii dukhad ghatana puure samudaay ke naak kaa sawaal ban jaati he
 You think this is not a normal situation
 mukhyamantri yogi javabdeh ho sakate hai magar halaat to aapke pados main paidaa ho rahe hai
 The police is also thinking but the police has more work to do
 aisa nahin he ki aparaadh or takaraav kii in khabaron ke bich romiyon kaa skool college main atendence 100 percent ho gaya he
 They are still likely to be seen outside the society
 isliye police in romeo ko pakadaney kii training le rahi he
 Merchants were killed in Mathura, robbed of five crores, then the same police also caught, do not know what happened to those who attacked the policemen in Agra
 kam se kam upi police ko apane sipaahiyon or afasaron ke upar hue hamalon par states report deni chahie ki in maamalon main wo zaraa fast he or karrwai kar di gai he
 So that people get confidence that at least don't disturb the police
 kya aap jaanate hai ki saharanpur main esaspi rahe lav kumaar ke ghar par jo bheed ghusi thi, usamen maamla darj hua tha, uskaa kya hua
 He was transferred, now SSP who has replaced Luv Kumar has also been transferred
 in sab halaat ke bich uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath vidhansabha main kah chuke hai ki rajya main aparaadhiyon ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 The inspiration to give discourse has come from the speeches of today's leaders, who have started giving less talk of politics, more types of moral education
 agar sarleekaran karnaa ho to kah sakate hai ki upi bekaabu ho gaya he
 The new Chief Minister has not been able to handle Yogi
 media ke jis hisse main unke din raat jag kar aadhi raat ko meeting kar faisle lene kii khabaren aa rahi thim vahaan bhi sarleekaran shuru ho gaya hoga
 After the new government, there have been some incidents that are not giving a good signal but there is peace in many parts of UP and it is going well
 hamane yah tay kar liya tha ki faansee kii sazaa denge to balaatkaar kii ghatana kam ho jaaegi
 Clean and strong message will be sent
 lekin nahin hua
 For this, there is no punishment for the guilty, there is not even a guilty government, but moral responsibility is definitely made, but there is something, we do not want to talk on the basis of this problem
 greater noida main jevar ek jagah he yumna express ve ke paas
 The incident that happened there on Wednesday night asks the government questions, it also asks the society
 sabauta gaanv ke paas yamuna express ve par hathiyaarband chah gundon ne ek car roak lee
 The incident took place between one and a half to two and a half nights
 is car main aath log the jo jevar se bulandshahr ja rahe the
 The robbery protested by family head Shakeel Qureshi when he was shot
 pehle gunde shakeel ke bacchon ko goli maar rahe the lekin jab shakeel ne minnat kii to bacchon ko chhod diya or shakeel ko goli maar di
 The men were tied up by the women's trunks and hung upside down
 phir chaaron mahilaon ko utaar kar khet main le gaye or gang rape kiya
 Shakeel and his family were traveling on such a night that their relatives had to be delivered
 jaccha or baccha donon khatare main the
 So the whole family ran away to help them
 police ghatana ke ek ghante baad pahunchi
 Within an hour, the criminals destroyed the life of one family who came out to save the life of another family
 31 july 2016 ke rose dhai baje tadake bulandshahr zile main dilli kanpur haive par aisi hi ghatana hui thi
 a family left from Noida for Shahjahanpur as he was to attend a funeral
 us car main pati patni, do betiyaan or do purush rishtedaar savaar the
 Five six bandits stopped the car
 45 saal kii mahila or 15 saal kii mahila ko car se utaar kar le gaye or unke saath balaatkaar kiya
 During this, the rest of the family was held hostage at gunpoint
 us samay kai channelon ne kitna surakshit he upi kaa haive tip kaarykram kiya
 Pressure was also created and security arrangements must have been made
 tab netaaon ne kaha tha ki upi main gunda raaj he
 The rule has changed but the goons have not changed
 apradhi 24 ghante ke andar pakade gaye the magar aparaadh kii pravriti nahin thami he
 When the expressway and the highway are not safe, then who will guarantee what will happen to the families going into emergency overnight
 yah bhi sahi nahin he ki haive par police kii car nahin hoti he
 it occurs
 phir bhi ghatnaayen hoti hai
 Highway police arrive late
 aparaadh kii ghatana par raajnneeti se aparaadh par koi asar nahin padataa he
 It may take some time for the morale of criminals to break in the state where the news of beating of police officers started coming soon
 haalanki ab adhikariyon ke peetane kii ghatnaayen band ho gayi hai lekin uttar pradesh kaa raajnneetik or saamaajik charitra raaton raat to nahin badal saktaa he
 Talk about how it should change
 murabadabaad main bhaajapa ke nagar adhyaksh hai, unhen giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Why has it been done because the city president went to the police station with someone's complaint, the complaint was taken, but when the assurance of action was received, the BJP leaders became dissatisfied
 aarope he ki netaa ji ne thakurdwara thane main tainaat daaroga se hathapayee kii, is marpet main daaroga ji ko chotein ain hai, jiskaa medical kara liya gaya he
 Sitting equal to the inspector's chair, he is heard saying that the policeman will be beaten up, the police will be beaten outside the police station, and when the beating is done, we see who comes to save the minister
 itane pratibhashali nagar adhyaksh ke liye badhiya script na likhane ke aarope main geetkaar javed akhtar ko giraftaar kar lenaa chahie
 Anyway, the BJP District Magistrate also came to help in this great task of improving the police
 jab hamaare samvaadadaata anwar ne sio yani kshetradhikari se baat kii to unase raajnneetik dal kaa naam bhi nahin liya gaya
 Some political party kept saying that they had complained
 ham unka dar samajhate hai, unke vyaavhaarik hone kaa sammaan karte hai, ek bayaan ke chalate transfar jhelo or pataa nahin kya jhelo, uchit nahin lagata he
 Through the video, you can guess what happened there, a beep sound will be heard, that means there are abuses at that place which we cannot hear on TV
 yah baat shodh kaa vishay he ki sarkaar bijepi kii he phir bhi nagar adhyaksh ko itane logon ke saath exiaar ke liye kyon janaa padaa
 If this is their situation, then debate about the police stations across the country, where FIR is also not less than a mess
 farji exiaar to alag vishay he
 The city president was also arrested on charges of assault but got bail from the police station itself
 nagar adhyaksh ji, savinay nivedan he ki gusse ko kaabo main rakhen
 Daroga sorry for what happened to Amit Sharma
 rahi baat kanoon kii to sabko pataa he yah apana kaam karata he
 On 9 May, outside the RTO office of Moradabad, the BJP and Banjrang Dal people got involved in the matter of who would sell the medical kit for the trains coming for fitness checking
 is baat ke liye donon pakshon main talwarbazi kaa bhi pradarshan hua
 These symbols of Indian culture can be used not only to scare history, but also to sell medical kits, this knowledge i have gained from this video footage but not in the history class
 lathi danda jaise paaramparik hathiyaaron kaa bhi istamaal hua
 The stones have also gone, but it is not known whether the inspiration to run the stone has been received from Kashmir or the local has met someone
 or haa, 7 round goli bhi chali he
 This means both sides must have been skilled in traditional as well as modern combat skills
 sochiye shaury kaa yah pradarshan baari vaahanon main medical kit lagane ke theke ko lekar hua he
 You must understand how important the role of contracts is in nation building
 iske baad azaad bharat kii police dal bal ke saath pahunchi tab tak ladane vaale bhaag chuke the
 An arrest has also been made in this case
 bajrang dal or bhaajapa bhi aapas main goli baari kar sakate hai isaki kalpana ashok vaajapeyi or kedarnath singh jaise libral kaviyon ne bhi apni kavita main nahin kii he
 You must be wondering why i am not anchoring with an angry attitude about these law and order problems
 ab is tarah se kisi ko goli chalaate dekhenge, thane main ghus kar maarthe dekhenge to shant rahanaa hi samyaanukool hoga
 Talking about Pakistan, all the generals and army chiefs would have been challenged because i trust my army that they will not allow them to reach the studio
 police par bhi bharosa he magar is lever kaa bharosa nahin he
 That is why our anchor people pay more attention to Pakistan
 ham upi kii baat kar rahe hai
 Minister met in Firozabad, Transport Minister does not know about the incident but has given a strong statement about what will be the action
 iske baad kanoon vyavastha ke mantri ram pati ji kaa bhi bayaan suniyegaa jo unhone unnav main diya he
 Will go to the ground or be killed
 is tarah ke ugr bayanon se acha he ki vyavasthaaon ko thik kiya jaae, jahaan police bhi behatar ho or police ko koi netaa maare bhi na
 Police stations have become the hub of politics all over the country
 ek exiaar karaane ke liye kisi ko sau logon ke saath kyon janaa padataa he
 Apart from this, also think on why this is happening in UP
 kyon kahin sampradaay to kahin samudaay aapas main bhide hue hai
 Why the violence in Saharanpur has not stopped
 kyon aligarh main bhaanti bhaanti ke tanaav hai
 What is important is that every incident should be made a question of social arrogance, a question of ethnic arrogance
 itnaa gussa kyon he logon main
 The Home Ministry has sought a report on the violence in Saharanpur
 centre se rapid ection force kii chaar companiyaan vahaan bheji gai hai

 in sab halaat ke bich uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath vidhansabha main kah chuke hai ki rajya main aparaadhiyon ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Six armed goons stopped a car on Yamuna Expressway near Sabouta village
 ghatana raat dedh se dhai ke bich hui he
 There were eight people in this car who were going from Jewar to Bulandshahr
 lutpaat kaa parivaar ke mukhiya shakeel kuraishi ne virodh kiya to unhen goli maar di
 At first the goons were shooting Shakeel's children but when Shakeel pleaded, they released the children and shot Shakeel
 mahilaon ke tupatton se purushon ko baandh kar unhen ulta lataka diya
 Then the four women were taken down to the farm and gang raped
 shakeel or unka parivaar itani raat ko yatra isliye kar rahaa tha ki unke kisi rishtedaar kii delivery honi thi
 Both mother and child were in danger
 isliye puraa parivaar bhaag kar unki madad ke liye ja rahaa tha
 Police arrived an hour after the incident
 ek ghante ke bheetar aparaadhiyon ne kisi or parivaar kii zindagi bachaane nikle ek parivaar kii zindagi tabah kar di
 a similar incident took place on the Delhi Kanpur highway in Bulandshahr district at 2
30 am daily on 31 July 2016
 ek parivaar noida se shahjahanpur ke liye niklaa kyonki use ek antyeshti main shaamil hona tha
 Husband wife, two daughters and two male relatives were in the car
 paanch chah daakuon ne car roak lee
 The 45-year-old woman and the 15-year-old were taken off the car and raped her
 is dauraan baaki parivaaravaalon ko bandook kii nok par bandhak banaae rakhaa
 At that time, many channels did a highway type program of how safe UP is
 dabaav bhi bana or suraksha ke intazaam bhi kiye hi gaye honge
 Then the leaders had said that there is Gunda Raj in UP
 raaj to badal gaya magar gunde nahin badale hai
 The culprits were caught within 24 hours but the crime trend has not stopped
 jab express ve or haive surakshit nahin honge to raat biraat apaat sthiti main jane vaale pariwaron ke saath kya hoga, isaki guarantee koun legaa
 It is also not true that there is no police car on the highway
 hoti he
 Even then events do happen
 hive police der se pahunchati he
 Politics has no effect on crime in the event of crime
 jis rajya main sarkaar banate hi police adhikariyon ke peetane kii khabar aane lage us rajya main aparaadhiyon kaa manobal tuutane main thodaa to vakt lag saktaa he
 Although the incidents of beating of officers have stopped, the political and social character of Uttar Pradesh cannot change overnight
 kaise badalanaa chahie is par zarur baat kiijie
 bjp's city president in Moorabadabad, he has been arrested
 kyon kiya gaya he kyonki nagar adhyaksh ji kisi kii shikaayat lekar thane gaye, shikaayat le lee gai, magar jab karrwai kaa aashwaasan mila to bhaajapa netaa asantusht ho gaye
 It is alleged that Netaji scrambled with the police station officer at the Thakurdwara police station, in which the policeman was injured in the fight, which has been medically taken
 inspector kii kursi ke baraabar baithkar yah kehete sune gaye hai ki daaroga ko juute maarenge, thane ke baahar police kii pitayee hogi, or jab pitayee hogi to dekhte hai koun mantri bachaane aate hai
 Lyricist Javed Akhtar should be arrested for not writing a good script for such a talented city president
 kair, police ko sudhaarney ke nagar adhyaksh ke is mahaan kaary main madad ke liye bhaajapa ziladhyaksh bhi aa gaye
 When our correspondent Anwar spoke to the CO or the jurisdictional officer, the name of the political party was not taken from him
 kehete rahe kisi raajnneetik dal ne shikaayat kii thi
 We understand their fear, respect their practicality, because of a statement, the transfer will go away and i do not know what it is that does not seem appropriate
 aap video ke zariye kuch andaaza kiijie ki vahaan kya hua hoga, ek beep sound sunai degi, iskaa matlab he us jagah par aisi gaaliyaan di gayi hai jise ham tivi par nahin suna sakate
 It is a matter of research that the government belongs to BJP, yet why the city president had to go for an FIR with so many people
 agar unki ye sthiti he to phir desh bhar ke thanon ko lekar bahes kiijie jahaan exiaar karana bhi ek jhamele se kam nahin he
 a fake FIR is a different subject
 nagar adhyaksh ko marpet ke aarope main giraftaar bhi kiya gaya lekin thane se hi zamaanat mil gai
 City President, a humble request is to keep the anger under control
 daaroga amit sharma ke saath jo hua uske liye khed vyakt karen
 Regarding the law, everyone knows that it does its job
 muradabad ke artio karyaalay ke baahar 9 may ko bijepi or banjrang dal ke log aapas main is baat ko lekar ulajh gaye ki fitness checking ke liye aane vaali gadiyon ke liye medical kit koun bechega
 Fencing was also demonstrated on both sides for this
 bhartiya samskruti ke in pratikon kaa istamaal sirf itihaas ko lekar daraane ke kaam main hi nahin, medical kit bechney ke kaam main bhi laayaa ja saktaa he, yah gyaan mujhe itihaas kii kaksha main nahin balki is video footage se praapt hua he
 Traditional weapons like lathi poles were also used
 pathar bhi chale hai magar yah gyaat nahin hua ki pathar chalaane kii prerana kashmir se mili he yaa local hi kisi se mil gai he
 And yes, the 7 round shot is also fired
 iskaa matlab donon paksh paaramparik ke saath saath aadhunik yuddh kaushal main bhi daksh rahe honge
 Think this performance of Shaurya has taken place on the contract to install medical kit in heavy vehicles
 raashtra nirmaan main theke kaa role kitna mahatvapurn he aap samaj rahe honge
 After this, the police team of independent India arrived with the force, the fighters had fled
 is maamle main giraftaar bhi hui he
 The Bajrang Dal and the BJP can also shoot at each other, not even the poets like Ashok Vajpayee and Kedarnath Singh in their poetry
 aap soch rahe honge ki kanoon vyavastha kii in karaabiyon ko lekar main krodhit tevar ke saath ankaring kyon nahin kar rahaa hum
 Now in this way, we will see someone firing, if you enter the police station and kill them, then it will be time to keep calm
 pakistan kii baat hoti to vahaan ke saare generalon, senadhyakshon ko lalkaar detaa kyonki mujhe apni sena par bharosa he ki wo inhen studio tak pahunchane hi nahin degi
 Police is also trusted, but this labor is not trusted
 isiilie hamaare ankar log pakistan par zyaada dhyaan dete hai
 We are talking about U
P
 phirozabad main mantri ji mil gaye, parivahan mantri, ghatana ke bare main pataa nahin magar karrwai kya hogi uske bare main zordaar bayaan diya he
 After this, you will also hear the statement of law and order minister Ram Pati which he has given in Unnao
 zamin main jaaenge yaa maare jaaenge
 It is good to make such extreme statements that the systems are corrected, where the police is better and no leader is killed
 puure desh main thane raajnneeti kaa adda ban gaye hai
 Why does one have to go with hundred people to get an FIR done
 iske alaava is baat par bhi sochiye upi main aisa kyon ho rahaa he
 Why are the communities clashing with each other somewhere? kyon saharanpur kii hinsa tham nahin rahi he
 Why there are many tensions in Aligarh
 kya zaruri he ki har ghatana ko saamaajik ahan kaa sawaal bana diya jaae, jaateey ahankaar kaa sawaal bana diya jaae
 Why are people so angry? saharanpur kii hinsa par grih mantralay ne report maangi he
 Four companies of Rapid Action Force have been sent from the center
 5 may se vahaan tarah tarah ke jhagade ho rahe hai
 First, there was tension about Ambedkar Jayanti's procession, then there was tension about Maharana Pratap Jayanti's Shobha Yatra
 kai logon ne kaha ki upi main maharana pratap jayanti kii shobhaa yatra pehle nahin suni
 Similarly, many types of trips have started coming out from time to time
 tanaav ke kaarnon par bahes ho sakati he, lekin is hinsa main ek se adhik logon kii jaan ja chuki he, kai log ghayal hai or kai log jail main hai
 Even after this, the violence is not stopping
 kya is hinsa ke baad raajnneetik hisaab hona he, kiskaa vot kise milegaa, kya itani si baat saharanpur kii janata nahin samajhati he ki ve shant rahen, kya unke bich koi nahin he jo is ladaai ko band karawaaye
 Somewhere there is Jatav versus Thakur and somewhere it is Balmiki versus Muslim
 is hinsa kii buniyaad ko samajhnaa hoga, kya koi ek varg satta milane se zyaada utsahit he, kya kisi ek varg ko lag rahaa he ki satta uski he
 So the solution lies in the behavior of the government as well as in the society
 samaaj ko bhi thodaa sudharna hoga or wo sudhaar satta se behatar koi nahin kar saktaa
 In the news of violence and confrontation, it is not just Hindus vs Muslims, Jatavs vs Rajputs, somewhere there are Rajputs vs Muslims and somewhere Hindus vs Hindus
 jharkhand main to gautam gunjan or gangesh ko bhi bheed ne maar diya
 We have to think that this political aggression of waste can be a formula to win elections and not to live
 upi hi kyon, aap bengal dekh lijie, baat baat main takaraav he, baat baat main hinsa he
 There has also been a demand to send companies of Rapid Action Force there
 mukhyamantriyon se istife kii maang kii raajnneeti to hoti rahegi, pehle apane saamaajik rishton kaa khyaal kiijie, unhen bigadane mat dijie
 Thakurs of Keshopur Jafri village reached the police station and said that we will adopt Islam
 vidhayak ne bhi inhen samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 People of Thakur caste had complained that they have been harassed and people of Jatav society are talking about conversion
 jab unhen islam main nyaay mil rahaa he to ham bhi dharm parivartan karenge
 The people of Dalit society said that they are changing their religion and they put pictures of their deities in the pond
 aarope yah laga ki thakur samaaj ne apni ek naalee jatvon ke mohalle kii taraf khol di
 There was a confrontation against it
 police ne donon pakshon ke logon ke khilaaf maamla to darj kar liya he lekin kya ziladhikari ko jaakar nahin dekhnaa chahie ki kisi mohalle kii taraf naalee kholi gai he yaa nahin
 If opened, it should be closed
 is khabar ke or bhi pahalu honge jo samay kii kami ke kaaran ham nahin bataa rahe hai lekin donon samaaj kii yah zid bataa rahi he ki baat se jitani samasya nahin he utani mohabbat apni apni zid se he
 That's why i am so angry about each other
 25 may ko aligarh ke ek ilaake main drone camere se nigaraanee kii gai
 Police is finding out from drone camera that there is something wrong
 ek hafte ke bheetar do samudaay do baar aamane saamne aa gaye
 What was the matter, the child of the Balmiki community got injured on the bike of the youth of the Muslim community
 is baat ko lekar jhagada do samudaayon ke bich ban gaya, agar police nahin sambhalati to na jane kitne logon kii jaan chali jaati
 The comments ab sochiye ki vaaki logon ke paas itani fursat he ki baat baat main itani ladaai ho rahi he
 After all, why has the trust of one society become so low that the tragic incident with one becomes the question of the whole community
 aap sochiye ye saamaanya sthiti nahin he
 Chief Minister Yogi may be accountable but circumstances are arising in your neighborhood
 police bhi soch rahi he lekin police ko or bhi kaam he
 It is not that between these reports of crime and confrontation, the attendance of Romans in the school college has increased to 100%
 samaaj main unke baahar dekhe jane kii sambhaavna abhi bhi he
 So the police is taking training to catch these Romeo
 mathura main vyapaariyon kii hatya hui, paanch karod kii lut hui thi to usee police ne pakadaa bhi, pataa nahin un logon kaa kya hua jinhone agra main police waalon par hamale kiye the
 At least the UP Police should give a status report on the attacks on its soldiers and officers that in these cases it is a bit fast and action has been taken
 taaki logon ko bharosa mili ki kam se kam police ko mat chhedo
 Do you know what happened to the mob that had entered the house of Luv Kumar, the SSP in Saharanpur,? unka tabadalaa kar diya gaya, lav kumaar kii jagah jo esaspi aae ab unka bhi tabadalaa ho chukaa he
 Amidst all these situations, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said in the assembly that there is no place for criminals in the state
 31 july 2016 ke rose dhai baje tadake bulandshahr zile main dilli kanpur haive par aisi hi ghatana hui thi
 a family left from Noida for Shahjahanpur as he was to attend a funeral
 us car main pati patni, do betiyaan or do purush rishtedaar savaar the
 Five six bandits stopped the car
 45 saal kii mahila or 15 saal kii mahila ko car se utaar kar le gaye or unke saath balaatkaar kiya
 During this, the rest of the family was held hostage at gunpoint
 us samay kai channelon ne kitna surakshit he upi kaa haive tip kaarykram kiya
 Pressure was also created and security arrangements must have been made
 tab netaaon ne kaha tha ki upi main gunda raaj he
 The rule has changed but the goons have not changed
 apradhi 24 ghante ke andar pakade gaye the magar aparaadh kii pravriti nahin thami he
 When the expressway and the highway are not safe, then who will guarantee what will happen to the families going into emergency overnight
 yah bhi sahi nahin he ki haive par police kii car nahin hoti he
 it occurs
 phir bhi ghatnaayen hoti hai
 Highway police arrive late
 aparaadh kii ghatana par raajnneeti se aparaadh par koi asar nahin padataa he
 It may take some time for the morale of criminals to break in the state where the news of beating of police officers started coming soon
 haalanki ab adhikariyon ke peetane kii ghatnaayen band ho gayi hai lekin uttar pradesh kaa raajnneetik or saamaajik charitra raaton raat to nahin badal saktaa he
 Talk about how it should change
 murabadabaad main bhaajapa ke nagar adhyaksh hai, unhen giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Why has it been done because the city president went to the police station with someone's complaint, the complaint was taken, but when the assurance of action was received, the BJP leaders became dissatisfied
 aarope he ki netaa ji ne thakurdwara thane main tainaat daaroga se hathapayee kii, is marpet main daaroga ji ko chotein ain hai, jiskaa medical kara liya gaya he
 Sitting equal to the inspector's chair, he is heard saying that the policeman will be beaten up, the police will be beaten outside the police station, and when the beating is done, we see who comes to save the minister
 itane pratibhashali nagar adhyaksh ke liye badhiya script na likhane ke aarope main geetkaar javed akhtar ko giraftaar kar lenaa chahie
 Anyway, the BJP District Magistrate also came to help in this great task of improving the police
 jab hamaare samvaadadaata anwar ne sio yani kshetradhikari se baat kii to unase raajnneetik dal kaa naam bhi nahin liya gaya
 Some political party kept saying that they had complained
 ham unka dar samajhate hai, unke vyaavhaarik hone kaa sammaan karte hai, ek bayaan ke chalate transfar jhelo or pataa nahin kya jhelo, uchit nahin lagata he
 Through the video, you can guess what happened there, a beep sound will be heard, that means there are abuses at that place which we cannot hear on TV
 yah baat shodh kaa vishay he ki sarkaar bijepi kii he phir bhi nagar adhyaksh ko itane logon ke saath exiaar ke liye kyon janaa padaa
 If this is their situation, then debate about the police stations across the country, where FIR is also not less than a mess
 farji exiaar to alag vishay he
 The city president was also arrested on charges of assault but got bail from the police station itself
 nagar adhyaksh ji, savinay nivedan he ki gusse ko kaabo main rakhen
 Daroga sorry for what happened to Amit Sharma
 rahi baat kanoon kii to sabko pataa he yah apana kaam karata he
 On 9 May, outside the RTO office of Moradabad, the BJP and Banjrang Dal people got involved in the matter of who would sell the medical kit for the trains coming for fitness checking
 is baat ke liye donon pakshon main talwarbazi kaa bhi pradarshan hua
 These symbols of Indian culture can be used not only to scare history, but also to sell medical kits, this knowledge i have gained from this video footage but not in the history class
 lathi danda jaise paaramparik hathiyaaron kaa bhi istamaal hua
 The stones have also gone, but it is not known whether the inspiration to run the stone has been received from Kashmir or the local has met someone
 or haa, 7 round goli bhi chali he
 This means both sides must have been skilled in traditional as well as modern combat skills
 sochiye shaury kaa yah pradarshan baari vaahanon main medical kit lagane ke theke ko lekar hua he
 You must understand how important the role of contracts is in nation building
 iske baad azaad bharat kii police dal bal ke saath pahunchi tab tak ladane vaale bhaag chuke the
 An arrest has also been made in this case
 bajrang dal or bhaajapa bhi aapas main goli baari kar sakate hai isaki kalpana ashok vaajapeyi or kedarnath singh jaise libral kaviyon ne bhi apni kavita main nahin kii he
 You must be wondering why i am not anchoring with an angry attitude about these law and order problems
 ab is tarah se kisi ko goli chalaate dekhenge, thane main ghus kar maarthe dekhenge to shant rahanaa hi samyaanukool hoga
 Talking about Pakistan, all the generals and army chiefs would have been challenged because i trust my army that they will not allow them to reach the studio
 police par bhi bharosa he magar is lever kaa bharosa nahin he
 That is why our anchor people pay more attention to Pakistan
 ham upi kii baat kar rahe hai
 Minister met in Firozabad, Transport Minister does not know about the incident but has given a strong statement about what will be the action
 iske baad kanoon vyavastha ke mantri ram pati ji kaa bhi bayaan suniyegaa jo unhone unnav main diya he
 Will go to the ground or be killed
 is tarah ke ugr bayanon se acha he ki vyavasthaaon ko thik kiya jaae, jahaan police bhi behatar ho or police ko koi netaa maare bhi na
 Police stations have become the hub of politics all over the country
 ek exiaar karaane ke liye kisi ko sau logon ke saath kyon janaa padataa he
 Apart from this, also think on why this is happening in UP
 kyon kahin sampradaay to kahin samudaay aapas main bhide hue hai
 Why the violence in Saharanpur has not stopped
 kyon aligarh main bhaanti bhaanti ke tanaav hai
 What is important is that every incident should be made a question of social arrogance, a question of ethnic arrogance
 itnaa gussa kyon he logon main
 The Home Ministry has sought a report on the violence in Saharanpur
 centre se rapid ection force kii chaar companiyaan vahaan bheji gai hai
 Since May 5, there have been various fights
 pehle ambedkar jayanti kii shobhaayatra ko lekar tanaav hua, phir maharana pratap jayanti kii shobhaa yatra ko lekar tanaav hua
 Many said that Maharana Pratap Jayanti's Shobha Yatra in UP was not heard before
 isi tarah kai tarah kii yatraaen samay samay par nikalne lagi hai
 The reasons for the tension can be debated, but more than one person has died in this violence, many people are injured and many are in jail
 iske baad bhi hinsa nahin ruk rahi he
 Is there any political calculation after this violence, who will get their vote, does not the people of Saharanpur understand that they should remain calm, is there no one among them who should stop this fight
 kahin jatav banaam thakur he to kahin balmiki banaam muslim he
 The basis of this violence has to be understood, is any one class more excited than getting power, is any one class feeling that the power belongs to them
 to iskaa samaadhaan sarkaar ke vyavhaar main bhi he or samaaj main bhi he
 Society will also have to improve a little and no one can do better than that in power
 hinsa or takaraav kii khabaron main sirf hindu banaam muslim nahin hai, jatav banaam rajput hai to kahin rajput banaam muslim hai to kahin hindu banaam hindu hai
 In Jharkhand, Gautam Gunjan and Gangesh were also killed by the mob
 hamen yah sochna hoga ki phaltu kii yah raajnneetik aakraamakata chunaav jeetne kaa formula ho sakati he, jeene kaa nahin
 Why UP, you see Bengal, there is a conflict in the matter, there is violence in the matter
 vahaan bhi rapid ection force kii companiyaan bhejne kii maang hui he
 The politics of demanding resignation from the Chief Ministers will continue, first consider your social relationships, do not let them deteriorate
 keshopur jaafaree gaanv ke thakur log thane pahunch gaye or kaha ki ham islam apana lenge
 The MLA also tried to explain them
 thakur jati ke logon kii shikaayat thi ki unke saath utpeedan hua he or jatav samaaj ke log dharm parivartan karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 When they are getting justice in Islam, we will also convert
 dalit samaaj ke logon ne kaha ki apana dharm badal rahe hai or unhone apane devi devataaon kii tasviren talab main pravaahit kar deen
 The allegation was that the Thakur society opened a drain on the Jatavs' locality
 iske virodh main takaraav ho gaya
 The police have registered a case against the people of both the sides, but should the District Magistrate not go and see if the drain has been opened to any locality
 kholi gai he to use band karnaa chahie
 There will be other aspects of this news which we are not telling due to lack of time, but the stubbornness of both the society is telling that love is not as much problem as it is with its own stubbornness
 tabhi main kah rahaa hum ki itnaa gussa ek duusare ko lekar kyon he
 On 25 May, drone cameras were monitored in an area of aligarh
 police drone camere se pataa laga rahi he ki kahin kuch gadabad to nahin he
 Two communities came face to face twice within a week
 maamla kya tha, balmiki samudaay ke bachche kaa accident muslim samudaay ke yuvak kii bike se ho gaya
 a quarrel between the two communities became about this matter, if the police did not handle, then many people would have lost their lives
 tippaniyan Now think that people really have so much time that so much fighting is going on
 aakhir ek samaaj kaa duusare samaaj par bharosa itnaa kam kyon ho gaya he ki ek ke saath kii dukhad ghatana puure samudaay ke naak kaa sawaal ban jaati he
 You think this is not a normal situation
 mukhyamantri yogi javabdeh ho sakate hai magar halaat to aapke pados main paidaa ho rahe hai
 The police is also thinking but the police has more work to do
 aisa nahin he ki aparaadh or takaraav kii in khabaron ke bich romiyon kaa skool college main atendence 100 percent ho gaya he
 They are still likely to be seen outside the society
 isliye police in romeo ko pakadaney kii training le rahi he
 Merchants were killed in Mathura, robbed of five crores, then the same police also caught, do not know what happened to those who attacked the policemen in Agra
 kam se kam upi police ko apane sipaahiyon or afasaron ke upar hue hamalon par states report deni chahie ki in maamalon main wo zaraa fast he or karrwai kar di gai he
 So that people get confidence that at least don't disturb the police
 kya aap jaanate hai ki saharanpur main esaspi rahe lav kumaar ke ghar par jo bheed ghusi thi, usamen maamla darj hua tha, uskaa kya hua
 He was transferred, now SSP who has replaced Luv Kumar has also been transferred
 in sab halaat ke bich uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath vidhansabha main kah chuke hai ki rajya main aparaadhiyon ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 At that time, many channels did a highway type program of how safe UP is
 dabaav bhi bana or suraksha ke intazaam bhi kiye hi gaye honge
 Then the leaders had said that there is Gunda Raj in UP
 raaj to badal gaya magar gunde nahin badale hai
 The culprits were caught within 24 hours but the crime trend has not stopped
 jab express ve or haive surakshit nahin honge to raat biraat apaat sthiti main jane vaale pariwaron ke saath kya hoga, isaki guarantee koun legaa
 It is also not true that there is no police car on the highway
 hoti he
 Even then events do happen
 hive police der se pahunchati he
 Politics has no effect on crime in the event of crime
 jis rajya main sarkaar banate hi police adhikariyon ke peetane kii khabar aane lage us rajya main aparaadhiyon kaa manobal tuutane main thodaa to vakt lag saktaa he
 Although the incidents of beating of officers have stopped, the political and social character of Uttar Pradesh cannot change overnight
 kaise badalanaa chahie is par zarur baat kiijie
 bjp's city president in Moorabadabad, he has been arrested
 kyon kiya gaya he kyonki nagar adhyaksh ji kisi kii shikaayat lekar thane gaye, shikaayat le lee gai, magar jab karrwai kaa aashwaasan mila to bhaajapa netaa asantusht ho gaye
 It is alleged that Netaji scrambled with the police station officer at the Thakurdwara police station, in which the policeman was injured in the fight, which has been medically taken
 inspector kii kursi ke baraabar baithkar yah kehete sune gaye hai ki daaroga ko juute maarenge, thane ke baahar police kii pitayee hogi, or jab pitayee hogi to dekhte hai koun mantri bachaane aate hai
 Lyricist Javed Akhtar should be arrested for not writing a good script for such a talented city president
 kair, police ko sudhaarney ke nagar adhyaksh ke is mahaan kaary main madad ke liye bhaajapa ziladhyaksh bhi aa gaye
 When our correspondent Anwar spoke to the CO or the jurisdictional officer, the name of the political party was not taken from him
 kehete rahe kisi raajnneetik dal ne shikaayat kii thi
 We understand their fear, respect their practicality, because of a statement, the transfer will go away and i do not know what it is that does not seem appropriate
 aap video ke zariye kuch andaaza kiijie ki vahaan kya hua hoga, ek beep sound sunai degi, iskaa matlab he us jagah par aisi gaaliyaan di gayi hai jise ham tivi par nahin suna sakate
 It is a matter of research that the government belongs to BJP, yet why the city president had to go for an FIR with so many people
 agar unki ye sthiti he to phir desh bhar ke thanon ko lekar bahes kiijie jahaan exiaar karana bhi ek jhamele se kam nahin he
 a fake FIR is a different subject
 nagar adhyaksh ko marpet ke aarope main giraftaar bhi kiya gaya lekin thane se hi zamaanat mil gai
 City President, a humble request is to keep the anger under control
 daaroga amit sharma ke saath jo hua uske liye khed vyakt karen
 Regarding the law, everyone knows that it does its job
 muradabad ke artio karyaalay ke baahar 9 may ko bijepi or banjrang dal ke log aapas main is baat ko lekar ulajh gaye ki fitness checking ke liye aane vaali gadiyon ke liye medical kit koun bechega
 Fencing was also demonstrated on both sides for this
 bhartiya samskruti ke in pratikon kaa istamaal sirf itihaas ko lekar daraane ke kaam main hi nahin, medical kit bechney ke kaam main bhi laayaa ja saktaa he, yah gyaan mujhe itihaas kii kaksha main nahin balki is video footage se praapt hua he
 Traditional weapons like lathi poles were also used
 pathar bhi chale hai magar yah gyaat nahin hua ki pathar chalaane kii prerana kashmir se mili he yaa local hi kisi se mil gai he
 And yes, the 7 round shot is also fired
 iskaa matlab donon paksh paaramparik ke saath saath aadhunik yuddh kaushal main bhi daksh rahe honge
 Think this performance of Shaurya has taken place on the contract to install medical kit in heavy vehicles
 raashtra nirmaan main theke kaa role kitna mahatvapurn he aap samaj rahe honge
 After this, the police team of independent India arrived with the force, the fighters had fled
 is maamle main giraftaar bhi hui he
 The Bajrang Dal and the BJP can also shoot at each other, not even the poets like Ashok Vajpayee and Kedarnath Singh in their poetry
 aap soch rahe honge ki kanoon vyavastha kii in karaabiyon ko lekar main krodhit tevar ke saath ankaring kyon nahin kar rahaa hum
 Now in this way, we will see someone firing, if you enter the police station and kill them, then it will be time to keep calm
 pakistan kii baat hoti to vahaan ke saare generalon, senadhyakshon ko lalkaar detaa kyonki mujhe apni sena par bharosa he ki wo inhen studio tak pahunchane hi nahin degi
 Police is also trusted, but this labor is not trusted
 isiilie hamaare ankar log pakistan par zyaada dhyaan dete hai
 We are talking about U
P
 phirozabad main mantri ji mil gaye, parivahan mantri, ghatana ke bare main pataa nahin magar karrwai kya hogi uske bare main zordaar bayaan diya he
 After this, you will also hear the statement of law and order minister Ram Pati which he has given in Unnao
 zamin main jaaenge yaa maare jaaenge
 It is good to make such extreme statements that the systems are corrected, where the police is better and no leader is killed
 puure desh main thane raajnneeti kaa adda ban gaye hai
 Why does one have to go with hundred people to get an FIR done
 iske alaava is baat par bhi sochiye upi main aisa kyon ho rahaa he
 Why are the communities clashing with each other somewhere? kyon saharanpur kii hinsa tham nahin rahi he
 Why there are many tensions in Aligarh
 kya zaruri he ki har ghatana ko saamaajik ahan kaa sawaal bana diya jaae, jaateey ahankaar kaa sawaal bana diya jaae
 Why are people so angry? saharanpur kii hinsa par grih mantralay ne report maangi he
 Four companies of Rapid Action Force have been sent from the center
 5 may se vahaan tarah tarah ke jhagade ho rahe hai
 First, there was tension about Ambedkar Jayanti's procession, then there was tension about Maharana Pratap Jayanti's Shobha Yatra
 kai logon ne kaha ki upi main maharana pratap jayanti kii shobhaa yatra pehle nahin suni
 Similarly, many types of trips have started coming out from time to time
 tanaav ke kaarnon par bahes ho sakati he, lekin is hinsa main ek se adhik logon kii jaan ja chuki he, kai log ghayal hai or kai log jail main hai
 Even after this, the violence is not stopping
 kya is hinsa ke baad raajnneetik hisaab hona he, kiskaa vot kise milegaa, kya itani si baat saharanpur kii janata nahin samajhati he ki ve shant rahen, kya unke bich koi nahin he jo is ladaai ko band karawaaye
 Somewhere there is Jatav versus Thakur and somewhere it is Balmiki versus Muslim
 is hinsa kii buniyaad ko samajhnaa hoga, kya koi ek varg satta milane se zyaada utsahit he, kya kisi ek varg ko lag rahaa he ki satta uski he
 So the solution lies in the behavior of the government as well as in the society
 samaaj ko bhi thodaa sudharna hoga or wo sudhaar satta se behatar koi nahin kar saktaa
 In the news of violence and confrontation, it is not just Hindus vs Muslims, Jatavs vs Rajputs, somewhere there are Rajputs vs Muslims and somewhere Hindus vs Hindus
 jharkhand main to gautam gunjan or gangesh ko bhi bheed ne maar diya
 We have to think that this political aggression of waste can be a formula to win elections and not to live
 upi hi kyon, aap bengal dekh lijie, baat baat main takaraav he, baat baat main hinsa he
 There has also been a demand to send companies of Rapid Action Force there
 mukhyamantriyon se istife kii maang kii raajnneeti to hoti rahegi, pehle apane saamaajik rishton kaa khyaal kiijie, unhen bigadane mat dijie
 Thakurs of Keshopur Jafri village reached the police station and said that we will adopt Islam
 vidhayak ne bhi inhen samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 People of Thakur caste had complained that they have been harassed and people of Jatav society are talking about conversion
 jab unhen islam main nyaay mil rahaa he to ham bhi dharm parivartan karenge
 The people of Dalit society said that they are changing their religion and they put pictures of their deities in the pond
 aarope yah laga ki thakur samaaj ne apni ek naalee jatvon ke mohalle kii taraf khol di
 There was a confrontation against it
 police ne donon pakshon ke logon ke khilaaf maamla to darj kar liya he lekin kya ziladhikari ko jaakar nahin dekhnaa chahie ki kisi mohalle kii taraf naalee kholi gai he yaa nahin
 If opened, it should be closed
 is khabar ke or bhi pahalu honge jo samay kii kami ke kaaran ham nahin bataa rahe hai lekin donon samaaj kii yah zid bataa rahi he ki baat se jitani samasya nahin he utani mohabbat apni apni zid se he
 That is why i am saying why i am so angry with each other
 25 may ko aligarh ke ek ilaake main drone camere se nigaraanee kii gai
 Police is finding out from drone camera that there is something wrong
 ek hafte ke bheetar do samudaay do baar aamane saamne aa gaye
 What was the matter, the child of the Balmiki community got injured on the bike of the youth of the Muslim community
 is baat ko lekar jhagada do samudaayon ke bich ban gaya, agar police nahin sambhalati to na jane kitne logon kii jaan chali jaati
 The comments ab sochiye ki vaaki logon ke paas itani fursat he ki baat baat main itani ladaai ho rahi he
 After all, why has the trust of one society become so low that the tragic incident with one becomes the question of the whole community
 aap sochiye ye saamaanya sthiti nahin he
 Chief Minister Yogi may be accountable but circumstances are arising in your neighborhood
 police bhi soch rahi he lekin police ko or bhi kaam he
 It is not that between these reports of crime and confrontation, the attendance of Romans in the school college has increased to 100%
 samaaj main unke baahar dekhe jane kii sambhaavna abhi bhi he
 So the police is taking training to catch these Romeo
 mathura main vyapaariyon kii hatya hui, paanch karod kii lut hui thi to usee police ne pakadaa bhi, pataa nahin un logon kaa kya hua jinhone agra main police waalon par hamale kiye the
 At least the UP Police should give a status report on the attacks on its soldiers and officers that in these cases it is a bit fast and action has been taken
 taaki logon ko bharosa mili ki kam se kam police ko mat chhedo
 Do you know what happened to the mob that had entered the house of Luv Kumar, the SSP in Saharanpur,? unka tabadalaa kar diya gaya, lav kumaar kii jagah jo esaspi aae ab unka bhi tabadalaa ho chukaa he
 Amidst all these situations, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said in the assembly that there is no place for criminals in the state
 aparaadh kii ghatana par raajnneeti se aparaadh par koi asar nahin padataa he
 It may take some time for the morale of criminals to break in the state where the news of beating of police officers started coming soon
 haalanki ab adhikariyon ke peetane kii ghatnaayen band ho gayi hai lekin uttar pradesh kaa raajnneetik or saamaajik charitra raaton raat to nahin badal saktaa he
 Talk about how it should change
 murabadabaad main bhaajapa ke nagar adhyaksh hai, unhen giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Why has it been done because the city president went to the police station with someone's complaint, the complaint was taken, but when the assurance of action was received, the BJP leaders became dissatisfied
 aarope he ki netaa ji ne thakurdwara thane main tainaat daaroga se hathapayee kii, is marpet main daaroga ji ko chotein ain hai, jiskaa medical kara liya gaya he
 Sitting equal to the inspector's chair, he is heard saying that the policeman will be beaten up, the police will be beaten outside the police station, and when the beating is done, we see who comes to save the minister
 itane pratibhashali nagar adhyaksh ke liye badhiya script na likhane ke aarope main geetkaar javed akhtar ko giraftaar kar lenaa chahie
 Anyway, the BJP District Magistrate also came to help in this great task of improving the police
 jab hamaare samvaadadaata anwar ne sio yani kshetradhikari se baat kii to unase raajnneetik dal kaa naam bhi nahin liya gaya
 Some political party kept saying that they had complained
 ham unka dar samajhate hai, unke vyaavhaarik hone kaa sammaan karte hai, ek bayaan ke chalate transfar jhelo or pataa nahin kya jhelo, uchit nahin lagata he
 Through the video, you can guess what happened there, a beep sound will be heard, that means there are abuses at that place which we cannot hear on TV
 yah baat shodh kaa vishay he ki sarkaar bijepi kii he phir bhi nagar adhyaksh ko itane logon ke saath exiaar ke liye kyon janaa padaa
 If this is their situation, then debate about the police stations across the country, where FIR is also not less than a mess
 farji exiaar to alag vishay he
 The city president was also arrested on charges of assault but got bail from the police station itself
 nagar adhyaksh ji, savinay nivedan he ki gusse ko kaabo main rakhen
 Daroga sorry for what happened to Amit Sharma
 rahi baat kanoon kii to sabko pataa he yah apana kaam karata he
 On 9 May, outside the RTO office of Moradabad, the BJP and Banjrang Dal people got involved in the matter of who would sell the medical kit for the trains coming for fitness checking
 is baat ke liye donon pakshon main talwarbazi kaa bhi pradarshan hua
 These symbols of Indian culture can be used not only to scare history, but also to sell medical kits, this knowledge i have gained from this video footage but not in the history class
 lathi danda jaise paaramparik hathiyaaron kaa bhi istamaal hua
 The stones have also gone, but it is not known whether the inspiration to run the stone has been received from Kashmir or the local has met someone
 or haa, 7 round goli bhi chali he
 This means both sides must have been skilled in traditional as well as modern combat skills
 sochiye shaury kaa yah pradarshan baari vaahanon main medical kit lagane ke theke ko lekar hua he
 You must understand how important the role of contracts is in nation building
 iske baad azaad bharat kii police dal bal ke saath pahunchi tab tak ladane vaale bhaag chuke the
 An arrest has also been made in this case
 bajrang dal or bhaajapa bhi aapas main goli baari kar sakate hai isaki kalpana ashok vaajapeyi or kedarnath singh jaise libral kaviyon ne bhi apni kavita main nahin kii he
 You must be wondering why i am not anchoring with an angry attitude about these law and order problems
 ab is tarah se kisi ko goli chalaate dekhenge, thane main ghus kar maarthe dekhenge to shant rahanaa hi samyaanukool hoga
 Talking about Pakistan, all the generals and army chiefs would have been challenged because i trust my army that they will not allow them to reach the studio
 police par bhi bharosa he magar is lever kaa bharosa nahin he
 That is why our anchor people pay more attention to Pakistan
 ham upi kii baat kar rahe hai
 Minister met in Firozabad, Transport Minister does not know about the incident but has given a strong statement about what will be the action
 iske baad kanoon vyavastha ke mantri ram pati ji kaa bhi bayaan suniyegaa jo unhone unnav main diya he
 Will go to the ground or be killed
 is tarah ke ugr bayanon se acha he ki vyavasthaaon ko thik kiya jaae, jahaan police bhi behatar ho or police ko koi netaa maare bhi na
 Police stations have become the hub of politics all over the country
 ek exiaar karaane ke liye kisi ko sau logon ke saath kyon janaa padataa he
 Apart from this, also think on why this is happening in UP
 kyon kahin sampradaay to kahin samudaay aapas main bhide hue hai
 Why the violence in Saharanpur has not stopped
 kyon aligarh main bhaanti bhaanti ke tanaav hai
 What is important is that every incident should be made a question of social arrogance, a question of ethnic arrogance
 itnaa gussa kyon he logon main
 The Home Ministry has sought a report on the violence in Saharanpur
 centre se rapid ection force kii chaar companiyaan vahaan bheji gai hai

 kahin jatav banaam thakur he to kahin balmiki banaam muslim he
 The basis of this violence has to be understood, is any one class more excited than getting power, is any one class feeling that the power belongs to them
 to iskaa samaadhaan sarkaar ke vyavhaar main bhi he or samaaj main bhi he
 Society will also have to improve a little and no one can do better than that in power
 hinsa or takaraav kii khabaron main sirf hindu banaam muslim nahin hai, jatav banaam rajput hai to kahin rajput banaam muslim hai to kahin hindu banaam hindu hai
 In Jharkhand, Gautam Gunjan and Gangesh were also killed by the mob
 hamen yah sochna hoga ki phaltu kii yah raajnneetik aakraamakata chunaav jeetne kaa formula ho sakati he, jeene kaa nahin
 Why UP, you see Bengal, there is a conflict in the matter, there is violence in the matter
 vahaan bhi rapid ection force kii companiyaan bhejne kii maang hui he
 The politics of demanding resignation from the Chief Ministers will continue, first consider your social relationships, do not let them deteriorate
 keshopur jaafaree gaanv ke thakur log thane pahunch gaye or kaha ki ham islam apana lenge
 The MLA also tried to explain them
 thakur jati ke logon kii shikaayat thi ki unke saath utpeedan hua he or jatav samaaj ke log dharm parivartan karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 When they are getting justice in Islam, we will also convert
 dalit samaaj ke logon ne kaha ki apana dharm badal rahe hai or unhone apane devi devataaon kii tasviren talab main pravaahit kar deen
 The allegation was that the Thakur society opened a drain on the Jatavs' locality
 iske virodh main takaraav ho gaya
 The police have registered a case against the people of both the sides, but should the District Magistrate not go and see if the drain has been opened to any locality
 kholi gai he to use band karnaa chahie
 There will be other aspects of this news which we are not telling due to lack of time, but the stubbornness of both the society is telling that love is not as much problem as it is with its own stubbornness
 tabhi main kah rahaa hum ki itnaa gussa ek duusare ko lekar kyon he
 On 25 May, drone cameras were monitored in an area of aligarh
 police drone camere se pataa laga rahi he ki kahin kuch gadabad to nahin he
 Two communities came face to face twice within a week
 maamla kya tha, balmiki samudaay ke bachche kaa accident muslim samudaay ke yuvak kii bike se ho gaya
 a quarrel between the two communities became about this matter, if the police did not handle, then many people would have lost their lives
 tippaniyan Now think that people really have so much time that so much fighting is going on
 aakhir ek samaaj kaa duusare samaaj par bharosa itnaa kam kyon ho gaya he ki ek ke saath kii dukhad ghatana puure samudaay ke naak kaa sawaal ban jaati he
 You think this is not a normal situation
 mukhyamantri yogi javabdeh ho sakate hai magar halaat to aapke pados main paidaa ho rahe hai
 The police is also thinking but the police has more work to do
 aisa nahin he ki aparaadh or takaraav kii in khabaron ke bich romiyon kaa skool college main atendence 100 percent ho gaya he
 They are still likely to be seen outside the society
 isliye police in romeo ko pakadaney kii training le rahi he
 Merchants were killed in Mathura, robbed of five crores, then the same police also caught, do not know what happened to those who attacked the policemen in Agra
 kam se kam upi police ko apane sipaahiyon or afasaron ke upar hue hamalon par states report deni chahie ki in maamalon main wo zaraa fast he or karrwai kar di gai he
 So that people get confidence that at least don't disturb the police
 kya aap jaanate hai ki saharanpur main esaspi rahe lav kumaar ke ghar par jo bheed ghusi thi, usamen maamla darj hua tha, uskaa kya hua
 He was transferred, now SSP who has replaced Luv Kumar has also been transferred
 in sab halaat ke bich uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath vidhansabha main kah chuke hai ki rajya main aparaadhiyon ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 It is a matter of research that the government belongs to BJP, yet why the city president had to go for an FIR with so many people
 agar unki ye sthiti he to phir desh bhar ke thanon ko lekar bahes kiijie jahaan exiaar karana bhi ek jhamele se kam nahin he
 a fake FIR is a different subject
 nagar adhyaksh ko marpet ke aarope main giraftaar bhi kiya gaya lekin thane se hi zamaanat mil gai
 City President, a humble request is to keep the anger under control
 daaroga amit sharma ke saath jo hua uske liye khed vyakt karen
 Regarding the law, everyone knows that it does its job
 muradabad ke artio karyaalay ke baahar 9 may ko bijepi or banjrang dal ke log aapas main is baat ko lekar ulajh gaye ki fitness checking ke liye aane vaali gadiyon ke liye medical kit koun bechega
 Fencing was also demonstrated on both sides for this
 bhartiya samskruti ke in pratikon kaa istamaal sirf itihaas ko lekar daraane ke kaam main hi nahin, medical kit bechney ke kaam main bhi laayaa ja saktaa he, yah gyaan mujhe itihaas kii kaksha main nahin balki is video footage se praapt hua he
 Traditional weapons like lathi poles were also used
 pathar bhi chale hai magar yah gyaat nahin hua ki pathar chalaane kii prerana kashmir se mili he yaa local hi kisi se mil gai he
 And yes, the 7 round shot is also fired
 iskaa matlab donon paksh paaramparik ke saath saath aadhunik yuddh kaushal main bhi daksh rahe honge
 Think this performance of Shaurya has taken place on the contract to install medical kit in heavy vehicles
 raashtra nirmaan main theke kaa role kitna mahatvapurn he aap samaj rahe honge
 After this, the police team of independent India arrived with the force, the fighters had fled
 is maamle main giraftaar bhi hui he
 The Bajrang Dal and the BJP can also shoot at each other, not even the poets like Ashok Vajpayee and Kedarnath Singh in their poetry
 aap soch rahe honge ki kanoon vyavastha kii in karaabiyon ko lekar main krodhit tevar ke saath ankaring kyon nahin kar rahaa hum
 Now in this way, we will see someone firing, if you enter the police station and kill them, then it will be time to keep calm
 pakistan kii baat hoti to vahaan ke saare generalon, senadhyakshon ko lalkaar detaa kyonki mujhe apni sena par bharosa he ki wo inhen studio tak pahunchane hi nahin degi
 Police is also trusted, but this labor is not trusted

 phirozabad main mantri ji mil gaye, parivahan mantri, ghatana ke bare main pataa nahin magar karrwai kya hogi uske bare main zordaar bayaan diya he
 After this, you will also hear the statement of law and order minister Ram Pati which he has given in Unnao
 zamin main jaaenge yaa maare jaaenge
 It is good to make such extreme statements that the systems are corrected, where the police is better and no leader is killed
 puure desh main thane raajnneeti kaa adda ban gaye hai
 Why does one have to go with hundred people to get an FIR done
 iske alaava is baat par bhi sochiye upi main aisa kyon ho rahaa he
 Why are the communities clashing with each other somewhere? kyon saharanpur kii hinsa tham nahin rahi he
 Why there are many tensions in Aligarh
 kya zaruri he ki har ghatana ko saamaajik ahan kaa sawaal bana diya jaae, jaateey ahankaar kaa sawaal bana diya jaae
 Why are people so angry? saharanpur kii hinsa par grih mantralay ne report maangi he
 Four companies of Rapid Action Force have been sent from the center
 5 may se vahaan tarah tarah ke jhagade ho rahe hai
 First, there was tension about Ambedkar Jayanti's procession, then there was tension about Maharana Pratap Jayanti's Shobha Yatra
 kai logon ne kaha ki upi main maharana pratap jayanti kii shobhaa yatra pehle nahin suni
 Similarly, many types of trips have started coming out from time to time
 tanaav ke kaarnon par bahes ho sakati he, lekin is hinsa main ek se adhik logon kii jaan ja chuki he, kai log ghayal hai or kai log jail main hai
 Even after this, the violence is not stopping
 kya is hinsa ke baad raajnneetik hisaab hona he, kiskaa vot kise milegaa, kya itani si baat saharanpur kii janata nahin samajhati he ki ve shant rahen, kya unke bich koi nahin he jo is ladaai ko band karawaaye
 Somewhere there is Jatav versus Thakur and somewhere it is Balmiki versus Muslim
 is hinsa kii buniyaad ko samajhnaa hoga, kya koi ek varg satta milane se zyaada utsahit he, kya kisi ek varg ko lag rahaa he ki satta uski he
 So the solution lies in the behavior of the government as well as in the society
 samaaj ko bhi thodaa sudharna hoga or wo sudhaar satta se behatar koi nahin kar saktaa
 In the news of violence and confrontation, it is not just Hindus vs Muslims, Jatavs vs Rajputs, somewhere there are Rajputs vs Muslims and somewhere Hindus vs Hindus
 jharkhand main to gautam gunjan or gangesh ko bhi bheed ne maar diya
 We have to think that this political aggression of waste can be a formula to win elections and not to live
 upi hi kyon, aap bengal dekh lijie, baat baat main takaraav he, baat baat main hinsa he
 There has also been a demand to send companies of Rapid Action Force there
 mukhyamantriyon se istife kii maang kii raajnneeti to hoti rahegi, pehle apane saamaajik rishton kaa khyaal kiijie, unhen bigadane mat dijie
 Thakurs of Keshopur Jafri village reached the police station and said that we will adopt Islam
 vidhayak ne bhi inhen samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 People of Thakur caste had complained that they have been harassed and people of Jatav society are talking about conversion
 jab unhen islam main nyaay mil rahaa he to ham bhi dharm parivartan karenge
 The people of Dalit society said that they are changing their religion and they put pictures of their deities in the pond
 aarope yah laga ki thakur samaaj ne apni ek naalee jatvon ke mohalle kii taraf khol di
 There was a confrontation against it
 police ne donon pakshon ke logon ke khilaaf maamla to darj kar liya he lekin kya ziladhikari ko jaakar nahin dekhnaa chahie ki kisi mohalle kii taraf naalee kholi gai he yaa nahin
 If opened, it should be closed
 is khabar ke or bhi pahalu honge jo samay kii kami ke kaaran ham nahin bataa rahe hai lekin donon samaaj kii yah zid bataa rahi he ki baat se jitani samasya nahin he utani mohabbat apni apni zid se he
 That is why i am saying why i am so angry with each other
 25 may ko aligarh ke ek ilaake main drone camere se nigaraanee kii gai
 Police is finding out from drone camera that there is something wrong
 ek hafte ke bheetar do samudaay do baar aamane saamne aa gaye
 What was the matter, the child of the Balmiki community got injured on the bike of the youth of the Muslim community
 is baat ko lekar jhagada do samudaayon ke bich ban gaya, agar police nahin sambhalati to na jane kitne logon kii jaan chali jaati
 The comments ab sochiye ki vaaki logon ke paas itani fursat he ki baat baat main itani ladaai ho rahi he
 After all, why has the trust of one society become so low that the tragic incident with one becomes the question of the whole community

 Chief Minister Yogi may be accountable but circumstances are arising in your neighborhood
 police bhi soch rahi he lekin police ko or bhi kaam he
 It is not that between these reports of crime and confrontation, the attendance of Romans in the school college has increased to 100%
 samaaj main unke baahar dekhe jane kii sambhaavna abhi bhi he
 So the police is taking training to catch these Romeo
 mathura main vyapaariyon kii hatya hui, paanch karod kii lut hui thi to usee police ne pakadaa bhi, pataa nahin un logon kaa kya hua jinhone agra main police waalon par hamale kiye the
 At least the UP Police should give a status report on the attacks on its soldiers and officers that in these cases it is a bit fast and action has been taken
 taaki logon ko bharosa mili ki kam se kam police ko mat chhedo
 Do you know what happened to the mob that had entered the house of Luv Kumar, the SSP in Saharanpur,? unka tabadalaa kar diya gaya, lav kumaar kii jagah jo esaspi aae ab unka bhi tabadalaa ho chukaa he

 com / whkfd4dnz5— Heidi Klum (@heidiklum)july 10, 2014 Mollywood film director Omar Lulu has faced the wrath of veteran actor Mukesh Khanna
 darasal, omar lulu ne apni apakaming film dhamaakaa ke lokation kii kai tasviren share kii
 In one of these pictures, Malayali actor Mukesh was seen in Shaktimaan's costume
 iske baad shaktimaan bane mukesh kii tasviren viral hone lageen
 Many mimes were also made
 ye sab legendary actor mukesh khanna (original shaktimaan) ko bilkul pasand nahin aayaa
 Mukesh Khanna immediately filed a complaint against the director in FEFKA (film Employees Federation of Kerala)
 actor ne FEFKA se apil karte hue kaha ki diarector apni film main unke shaktimaan vaale kairactor ko istemaal band kare
 If not, then they will take legal action
 View this post on Instagramഅന്തസ്സുള്ള ശക്തിമാൻ DHAMAKA Location Funs 😁 # omarlulu # dhamakaa post shared byomar lulu(@omar_lulu_) onaug 26, 2019 at 6:53am pdtview this post on instagramdear @iammukeshkhanna Sir, i was informed by FEFKA of your complaint about depicting Shaktimaan as one of the characters in my upcoming movie _dhamaka_ 
 i understand that you are the copyright holder of the character 'shaktimaan', his costume, theme music etc and i should not have tried to use it in my film without your permission
 i sincerely apologize for the oversight and any inconvenience this might have caused you
 Superhero references are popularly used in South Indian movies and so we inadvertently overlooked the copyright concerns
 We intend to give due credit to you in the title credits of the movie
 i would also like to clarify a small misunderstanding in your complaint about the film
 In my film _dhamaka_ , the actor Mukesh does not actually play the character of Shaktimaan
 It is just a 10 second sequence in which a character visualizes Mukesh Sir (actor of DHAMAKA) as Shaktimaan for posing extraordinary health and stamina for his elder age and that is the only part in the movie where the superhero appears
 My writers had originally thought of Superman and i could not help changing it to Shaktimaan because generations of Indians were inspired by Shakthimaan since its inception in DD1 and i am a proud member of that fandom
 Shakthimaan was one of my favorite superheros that made my childhood so exciting and i still cherish great love and adoration for your character
 Malayali's nostalgia is incomplete without the memories of Shaktimaan, the first Indian superhero of Television
 You motivated young minds to harness superpowers from their own selves and fight against injustice in society and we are immensely grateful to you
 i hope you would accept this humble apology
 i also hope this would bring to a close all the controversies in media surrounding this issue
 Sorry Shakthimaan
 Your faithful fan Omar lulua post shared byomar LULU (@omar_lulu_) onsep 15, 2019 at 7:05 am PDT Mukesh Khanna believes that Omar Lulu is trying to show Shaktimaan's character in an objectionable manner
 unka maananaa he ki kisi ko bhi parde par shaktimaan ke kairactor ko pesh karne kaa adhikaar nahin he wo bhi phani tareeke se
 Because they are its copyright holders
 times of india ko mukesh khanna ne kaha- dhamaakaa ke mekars ne mujhase iske liye parmishan tak nahin lee he
 That is why i have complained to FEFKA
 is bich omar lulu ne insta par mukesh khanna se maafee maangi he
 He wrote that he would give him credit in the title credits of the film
 diarector ne ye bhi bataaya ki film main actor mukesh shaktimaan kaa kairactor nahin kar rahe hai
 This is just a 10-second sequence where a character actor imagines Mukesh in the role of Shaktimaan
 jiske baar asaadhaaran health, stemina he
 The superhero appears in just this part of the film

 Anirudh explains that Mirinda, a convincing Indian culture, got an opportunity to study Indian culture and sacred texts while studying
 uske baad ve bhartiya samskruti se kaaphi prabhavit hui
 This is how the two met
 
 
 mirinda kareeb dedh saal pehle paryatak ke taur par bodhgaya ghoomane ai thi
 During this time, he became friends with Anirudh, who was working as a guide
 donon ne i-mail idi or mobile number share kiye
 At that time Mirinda roamed around Bodh Gaya for about 15 days
 iske baad mirinda waapas australia chali gayi, magar donon ke bich mobile or i-mail ke jariye baat hoti rahi
 During this time, their friendship turned into love
 preet kii dori main bandhi mirinda iske baad lagaataar bharat aane lagi or donon main mulaakaat hoti rahi
 During this, both of them decided to get tied up in the parinasutra
 donon ne 14 sitambar ko kolkata kii court main hindu marriage act ke tahat shaadi kar lee
 Revenge your name for love 
 
 aniruddh ke liye mirinda ne apana naam bhi badal liya or premtirth ban gayi
 Now Mirinda likes to be called by Premathirtha
 premtirth kahati hai ki bharat main kii gayi shaadiyaan saat janmon tak kaa saath hota he
 Premtirtha said, 'my family may not have attended this wedding, but they got married only with their consent
 ' idhar, aniruddh ke parijan bhi is shaadi se khush hai
 His father Vasudev says, 'our family is happy with this marriage
 mirinda ke saath jivan to mere bete ko gujaarna he
 His choice is also like family
 'puure reeti-rivaaj ke saath hui shaadi
 
 
 In this wedding some locals became Baratis and some became Saratis
 mahilaon ne mangal geet gaae or sindoordaan kaa rivaaj bhi nibhaayaa gaya
 The temple's manager Harendra Kumar says that both of them had applied for marriage with consent

 input IANS se Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has made it clear in gestures that he does not desist from becoming the Prime Minister of the country, while his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is unlikely to be involved in electoral politics
 hindi akhbaar 'dainik bhaskar' ko die intervyuu main rahul gandhi ne kaha he ki unke bare main yah galat avadharana he ki wo jimmedaari se bhaagate hai
 They are always ready to take responsibility

 Congress's victory is necessary for the betterment of the country
 iske baad sanghathan ne jo jimmedaari di he yaa aage degi, main use nishtha ke saath nibhaaoongaa
 Priyanka Gandhi has no role in electoral politics, Rahul Gandhi said that Priyanka Gandhi is a sister along with being a friend
 ve congress kii ek kaaryakarta hai, isi naate wo sanghathan ko or majboot karne ke liye meri madad kar rahi hai
 i don't think he will have an election role
 rahul gandhi ke nijee shaukcongress upaadhyaksh ko swimming or running kaa shauk he
 He practices Ekido Japanese martial arts in addition to meditation

 Apart from this, Rahul Gandhi is very interested in technology
 ishaaron main narendra modi kii tulana aurangzeb se kiek sawaal ke jawaab main rahul gandhi ne kaha ki bharat main samraat ashok hue

 The emperor became famous for adding Ashoka

 So their names are taken with different respect
 aurangzeb kaa naam alag tarah se liya jaataa he
 Criticizing the BJP for the slogan 'congress Mukt Bharat', a one-man party, the BJP said, 'BJP today wants a person-centered regime which is not in the interest of the country
 desh par shashan kisi ek vyakti vishesh ke vichaaron or uske taur tareekon se nahin chalaaya janaa chahie
 The future of 120 crore people of the country can be shaped and improved by taking everyone along
 ’is desh ke diene main congressunhone kaha ki ‘congress is desh ke diene main samaayi hui he
 BJP, Congress is talking about a free India
 vah yah nahin samajhati ki congress ekmaatr raajnneetik takat he jisane is desh kii janata ko ekajute rakhaa he,’aam aadmi party ne meri baton par amal kiyah rahul gandhirahul gandhi ne kaha ki aam aadmi party ne unheen chizon ko amal kiya jisaki vakaalat ve karte rahe hai
 Apart from this, they also do not agree with the way Kejriwal's party works
 aam aadmi party se seekhney ke sawaal par unhone kaha, 'hamaari party ek gatisheel sanghathan he
 We have changed the modalities of politics in the past
 main jab se raajnneeti main aayaa hum tab se ye baaten uthaai hai
 He implemented some of these things
 par congress or aam aadmi party ke kaam karne kaa tarika alag-alag he
 Also i do not completely agree with his working attitude
 mere hisaab se koi bhi faisla karne se pehle najdiki phaayde se zyada bhavishya ke bare main sochna zyada jaruri
 ' dilli main badhate vaayu pradooshan kii vajahon main ek vajah crop burning bhi he, lekin is saal isamen kami darj kii gai he
 The Punjab government has told the NGT that between September 27 to October 26, there have been around 15,000 cases of burning of crops in Punjab this year, which is 30% less than the previous year
 punjab sarkaar ne bataaya ki pichley saal isi avadhi main fasalon ko jalaane ke takreeban 22000 maamle saamne aae the
 Significantly, the NGT has banned crop burning because this is the major reason for air pollution in Delhi
 dilli se sate paanch rajyon main crop burning ke chalate dilli kii havaasrdiyon kii shuruyaat se hipradooshit hona shuru ho jaati he pichley kuch saal main yah samasya or vikat ho gai he
 Due to crop burning in Punjab, the environment in Delhi is constantly polluted and to prevent this, the NGT has banned crop burning
 punjab ke alaava himachal, rajasthan or haryana jaise rajyon se bhi crop burning kii khabaren aati hai or vahaan se pradooshit hui vaayu dilli tak pahunchati he
 The information given by the Punjab government is definitely a relief but still the government has not been able to completely curb the crop burning despite the order of the NGT
 haal hi main dilli or aasapaas ke rajyon main pradooshan par lagaam lagane ke liye engiti ke alaava hycourt ne bhi aadesh diya he ki upi, haryana, rajasthan, punjab main crop burning par rokane ke liye kisaanon se fasal kaa wo hissaa jo vokhet main jala dete hai, paper industry or board industry kisaanon se khreeden
 On the one hand it will help the farmers financially and on the other hand the pollution caused by burning the residue of crops will also be curbed
 hoicourt ne upi, haryana, rajasthan or punjab aadi rajyon ko aadesh diya he ki wo apane ilaake main aane vaali sabhi paper company, biomas plant, power jenereshan plant, cement plant chalaane waalon ko kisaanon se fasalon ke avshesh kharidne ke nirdesh jari karen
 The High Court gave this order in view of pollution caused by burning of crop residues in delhi-ncr
 court ne kaha ki ye compinyon kii yah saamaajik jimmedaari he
 The court has directed the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to take a report every week from a special committee set up in each state to prevent the burning of crop residues
 vaise to holi 2 march ko he lekin meghalaya, tripura or nagaland main vidhansabha chunaavon kii matganana 3 march ko hone ke baad hi saaf hoga ki kin-kin partiyon ko jeet ke saath holi kaa jashn manaane kaa mauka milegaa, lekin meghalaya main matdaan ke dauraan kuch votaron ke naam jaanakar jarur holi kii tarang kaa ehsaas ho saktaa he

 votaron ke ajeeb naam kaa silsilaa yaheen khatm nahin ho jaataa
 Consider the names of these four voters who voted in Meghalaya on Tuesday
 
 
 ‘argentina’, ‘indonesia’, ‘sweden’ or ‘italy’
 All four voters are residents of Umniu Tamar village of Shelavidhan Sabha area of east Khasi Hills district
 deshon ke naamon par votaron ke naam par aap tajjub kar rahe hai to thahrie
 In Meghalaya, many voters named states and cities also voted
 jaise ki ‘tripura’, ‘meghalaya’, ‘goa’, ‘bombai’ or ‘vellore’
 Umanyu Tamar village is located in Pinarsala block near Bangladesh border
 is puure kshetra main 861 purushamtadataur 918 mahila matadaata hai
 Here the odd names of voters are registered in the voters list
 jaise ki skip, enjoy, welding, fethphul, averide, rajdoot, april, july, cairphuli, doyal, cirkil, sample, credit, study, protein, lead, karection, atension aadi
 There is a good craze for English here, so the names of many voters here are taken from English words
 ab tak aise voters ke naam jaanakar aap jarur hairaan ho rahe honge, lekin rukiye abhi or bada jhatka meghalaya vidhansabha chunaavon main khadey kuch ummidavaaron ke naam jaanakar lagegaa
 Some of the candidates who have tried their luck in elections are- Innocent, Couple, Moonlight, Hopeful, Defender, Witness Day, Comfort, Field Marshal, Process, Wellborn, Counselor, Good Leadership etc
 aise main agar aap agali baar meghalaya vidhansabha chunaav ke bare main sunen to sirf congress or bijepi jaisi partiyon ke naamon ko hi jehan main naa laaen, kuch aise naamon ko jaanane ke liye bhi taiyaar rahen jis naam ke bare main aapane pehle kabhi naa suna ho
 The church is now on target of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad with its statements
 vishwa hindu parishad ne carch ke bayanon kii kadi aalochana karte hue kaha ki bharat ke carch ek shadyantr rachane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The churches want such governments in the center and states to be able to prove their interests by becoming puppets of the Vatican
 vihip ke sanyukt mahasachiv dow
 Surendra Jain today said that after the Archbishop of Delhi, the Archbishop of Abowa also appears to be in danger
 ab yah spasht ho gaya he ki vatican ke ishaare par bharat kaa carch vartmaan sarkaron ke virodh main ek vaataavaran banane kaa shadyantr kar rahaa he
 Why do they see this only when the BJP government comes
 modi ji kii sarkaar aate hi carch par hamalon ke jhuthe prachaar kiye gayi
 He did not apologize even after being caught with these lies
 vishwa hindu parishad kaa kahana he ki atal sarkaar ke samay to carch ne sab simaaon ko tod diya tha
 The disgusting accusations that the then government and Hindu organizations made are not even worth discussing in a civilized society
 us samay vihip ne rashtriya alpsankhyak ayog se in aaropon kii jaanch ke liye kaha tha
 On which the Commission also denied that all these allegations are false
 vishwa hindu parishad ke mahasachiv surendra jain ne kaha ki vatican sampoorn vishwa main keval hindu samaaj ko hi nahin balki bharat ko badnaam karata he
 The Church of India commits the crime of defaming their own country by becoming their puppets
 apatkaal lagane, kashmiri hinduon ke narsanhaar, 1984 main sikhon kaa katleam main inako samvidhan khatre main nahin dikhaai diya
 It is a political conspiracy to bring a dancing government to the behest of the Vatican
 aword vaapasi mafia kii tarah ye bhi ek chuni hui sarkaar ko asthir karne kii supaari le kar kaam kar rahe hai
 The VHP joint general secretary also said that not only the clergy of Delhi and Goa but also during the elections in the states of Mizoram, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Punjab, the church has issued decrees to win a particular party
 yah koun sa secular kaary he?samvidhan puja kaa adhikaar detaa he lekin avaidh dharmantaran kaa adhikaar kisi ko nahin he
 Freedom of expression does not mean insulting the Hindu deities or burning their idols
 avaidh dharmantaran ko rokane vaale swami lakshmananand va shaantikali ji maharaj kii hatya koun se vaidhanik adhikaar ke antargat kii jaati he? unhen samaran rakhana chahie ki bharat apane samvidhan se chalata he, vatican ke samvidhan se nahin
 The Constitution of India is threatened by the political agenda of the Church and the aggressive agenda of conversion
 yah khatra puure desh ko bhalee bhaanti samaj main aa gaya he
 It was on this agenda that the Archbishop of Goa opposed India's independence in 1947
 1961 main inhone hi goa mukti kaa virodh karte hue kaha tha ki isaayiyon kaa kalyaan portugal kii gulaami main hi he
 Now they should introspect and apologize for their sins and get rid of the Vatican and walk according to the Constitution of India
 saamaanya varg main aarthik rup se kamjor logon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene ke liye mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main sanshodhit bill paas hua
 The decision of the Narendra Modi government just before the Lok Sabha elections is considered as a masterstroke
 ab centre sarkaar ke saamne is bill ko rajyasabha main paas karaane kii chunauti he
 The NDA government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, so how will the government pass this bill today will be seen

 He said that the government has the authority to bring the bill but the House follows the rules, without consensus the House has been extended for a day

 It seems that this bill for the government will be easily passed in Rajya Sabha
 bataa den ki loksabhaa kii tarah hi rajyasabha main bhi is bill ko paas karaane ke liye do tihaai se adhik voton kii jarurat hogi
 What does the Rajya Sabha equation say? Tell us that the NDA government has a much lower figure than the majority in the Rajya Sabha

 Now the bill is coming in the Rajya Sabha, but we stand on our stand

 On the second day of the strike, the cleaning staff laid siege to the house of East Delhi Mayor Neema Bhagat
 gheraav ke dauraan safai karmchaariyon ne jamkar narebaaji kii or emsidi ke saath saath dilli sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya
 Scavengers took out a rally from Chacha Nehru Hospital to the mayor's residence and then gathered outside the mayor's house in Geeta Colony and demonstrated

 It is seen that the strike was the second day of the strike of the cleaning workers on Thursday

 On Thursday, the garbage has started coming out from the slopes of East Delhi on the road
 purvi dilli ke rani garden ilaake main bane emsidi dhalaav ghar kaa kooda dhalaav ghar se baahar nikal chukaa he
 At the same time, after the absence of the cleaning workers, now the MCD has started the work of garbage through machines
 pandav nagar main bane dhalaav ghar par east emsidi kii jesibi se kooda uthaaya gaya
 Eastern municipal corporation cleaning workers have been on strike for the last two days
 safaai karmchaaree lagaataar dilli sarkaar or nigam ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Due to this, neither cleaning nor garbage has been picked up in East Delhi
 is vajah se kai jagah sadak tak kooda jamaa ho gaya he
 Due to this, the fear of spreading the disease has sat in the minds of many people
 logon kaa kahana he diwali aa rahi he, aise main hamane apane gharon kii safaai to kii he, magar sadak par is gandagi kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 People say that the Delhi government and the corporation should work together to solve the problem of cleanliness employees
 safaai karmchaariyon kii maangempoorvinagar nigamake safaai karmchaariyon ne isse pehle ek saal main 6 baar hadtaal kii thi
 At that time, the strike was about the salary of the employees
 is baar safaai karmchaariyon kii maang he ki unhen baqaaya arier diya jaae, die diya jaae
 Also, employees who have been working for the corporation for the last several years should be made permanent
 safaai karmchaaree union ke adhyaksh sanjay gahalot kaa kahana he ki ham apane adhikaar kaa paisa maang rahe hai, koi bheekh nahin maang rahen
 We have no hobby of spreading dirt in Delhi, but what to do? We also have to celebrate Diwali
 hamaare bhi bachche hai
 We should get our rightful money
 anischitaqaaleen hadatalpurvi dilli main patpadganj, lakshmi nagar, mayur vihaar main sabase zyaada gandagi jamaa he
 Now it seems people will have to face the mess even on Diwali
 safaai karmchaariyon ne elaan kiya he ki jab tak unki maange nahin maani jaaegi wo hadtaal waapas nahin lenge
 Let us tell you that Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia is an MLA
 log chaahate hai ki jald samasya kaa samaadhaan ho or diwali pradooshan mukt ho
 Mayor calls the strike politically motivated: East Delhi Mayor Nima Bhagat has termed the strike of the Safai employees as politically motivated
 unhone bataaya ki jab safai karmchaariyon kii sitambar kii tankhwaah auradivali kaa bonsadiya ja chukaa he phir bhi wo bina baat hadtaal kar rahe hai
 The mayor said union leaders may have political patronage behind the strike
 meyar na bataaya ki hadataali safai karmchaariyon par nigam karrwai karne par vichaar kar rahaa he

 Our aim is to present, through photographs, evidence of visual pollution, years of decay of the Taj, attempts to discolor it, unceasing carelessness under surveillance and neglect of a magnificent heritage

 Meanwhile, jalebis are also being fried somewhere and the sweet smell of fresh jalebis wrapped in syrup also floats in the air

 From the rooftop cafe built above the rooftops, the shining Taj, dazzling in the moonlight of the moon, is very picturesque

 He told Professor Meenakshi Dhotte of Delhi's School of Planning and Architecture that he would finalize the vision document of Taj Mahal within a month with the help of well-known experts and with the help of the court, if necessary
 pehle professor minakshi ko smarak ke chaaron ore ke paryaavaran samvedansheel kshetra main udyogon kii sankhya ko lekar galat jaankaree di gai thi
 The judges reiterated the harsh truth again, "if the Taj Mahal is over, there will be no second chance to rebuild it
" ''aupniveshik dharre kaa sangrakshanpadshahnamaa ke mutabik, badshaah shahjahan ne 1631 main taj mahal ke pravesh dwaar ke rup main mumtazabad (ab taj ganj) kii sthapana kii thi, jise usee varsh kholaa bhi gaya tha
 The idea was derived from the Quran: stepping out of the physical world into the realm of spiritual silence; Or a market full of chaos, opening towards Jannat
 unhone sadakon, bazaaron or chaar katre yaa sarai banane ke liye 50 lakh shahjahani rupye die
 There were arrangements to accommodate thousands of guests at each inn

 Taj Ganj lost its luster between 1899 and 1905, when it was separated from the Taj complex by the British Viceroy Lord Curzon, who was unaware of its importance

 2011 main neshnal institute of dizin, ahmedabad kii ek team ne do maheene tak lanbaa shodh (ise 'taj ganjah teking aavar heritage forward' naam diya) kiya tha
 The team has written in the paper that Taj Ganj has been excluded from all the brochures, maps given to tourists

 He recommended that Taj Ganj should be recognized as a 'heritage complex' and tried to take tourists through this 'historic arrangement' to the Taj to provide a 'unique visitor experience' to tourists
 isaki bajaae taj ganj ke taabut main aakhir keel is saal farvari main tab thok di gai jab ees ne mul yojana main her-pher karte hue taj ke itihaas main pehali baar dakshini get se pravesh par hi pratibandh laga diya

 The landmark decision came after hearing Mehta's public interest litigation to protect Taj from air pollution (MC Mehta v
 Central Government, 1996)
 unhone ek nae aavedan main aarope lagaaya ki teji se shaharikaran or shahar main chalane vaale vikaas kaaryon vagairah se nae prakaar ke drishy pradooshan ko janm diya he or isse taj ko bahut nuksaan pahunch rahaa he
 In fact, it is believed that air, soil, water, sound, light and biochemical — all these types of pollution together give rise to a new pollution 'visual pollution' or cause to be seen
 pradooshan kii is nai avadharana ke bare main abhi zyada charchaa nahin hoti
 Naveen Piplani, conservation architect and chief director of Delhi-based Intek Heritage Academy, says, "it is a type of pollution that hinders the enjoyment of seeing a picturesque place
" ''piplani 2002 se taj mahal conjarveshan kalabrative ke mukhya sadsy ke rup main kaam kar rahe hai
 From the furnishings in the streets surrounding the Taj due to administrative negligence, high voltage electrical wires hanging in the air, large signboards and plastic waste strewn all around, disrupting the Taj's viewing pleasure and Piplani's visual pollution
 The concept can be realized here anytime
 sangrakshanvaadi ab is drishy pradooshan se ladgaye ke prayaason par manthan kar rahe hai
 He explains, "today, it is believed that the concept of authenticity is an ethical basis for the preservation of cultural heritage
" ''dizin kii pramanikta, saamagree, shilp kaushal or anubhav kii satyata ke aadhaar par hi viraasat ke mulyon or gunon kii pramanikta tay honi chahie
 Taj Mahal is a World Heritage, so it should be specially taken care of here

 *** Attacking the Election Commission, BJP leaders Venkaiah Naidu and Prakash Javadekar said that the Election Commission has not yet taken any action on the Congress party vice-president
 naidu ne is mudde par chunaav ayog par kataaksh karte hue kaha ki raja kabhi koi galati nahin karata
 The leaders said that the Election Commission ordered the registration of an FIR against Narendra Modi merely for showing the election symbol, whereas the Election Commission has not taken any action even after the Aam Aadmi Party released two objectionable photographs of Rahul Gandhi
 is masale par chunaav ayog ne kaha ki jo tasviren rahul gandhi kii vot ke dauraan booth ke kamare se jari hui hai, vah is maamle main jaanch kara rahaa he
 In these pictures, Rahul Gandhi is seen standing close to the EVM machine
 naidu ne kaha ki ek pratyaashee ke taur par rahul gandhi ko iviem ke kareeb is prakaar jane kaa haq nahin he
 In such a situation, Naidu has accused the Election Commission of adopting double standards
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki rajya main congress party ke sahyogi dal samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar he isliye chunaav ayog ne koi kadam nahin uthaaya he
 It is noteworthy that on Wednesday itself, Election Officer Vinod Jutsi had said that no one except the voter has the right to be close to the EVM

 For the first time, it became clear that the diverse and colloquial Ghadarian Raj Samaj, with its many nail pimples and shadows, ranging from Pardashinshi Begums and Rajranis to Kutnis, Takhia prostitutes, Emperors, Nawabs to farmers, Harwahs, barbers, beggars and pilgrims
 How was it actually? With what inspiration did so many different groups against the British rule quell the caste-fraternity and religious-sect quarrels with astonishing solidarity and accept the leadership of two Muslim leaders (the Emperor of Delhi and Begum of Awadh) overnight; got you? The English translation (1857, The Real Story of an Uprising) of this eye-sighting description of a century and a half came from India and abroad so much that a third edition was ready within two years
 ab maine prakashkon se phir baat kii
 Why not on the centenary of Gadar, Amritlal Nagar himself had translated the English collection of Gadar in 1957, which was a rare collection of surviving memories of Gadar among people from the villages of the old Awadh princely state, translated into English
 Increase the order of indigenous history? Editor v
 es
 Karthika's answer was, Wow, righteousness and question-and-question? Quickly contacted Sharad Nagar, the son of Nagar ji in Lucknow
 kya ve anuwaad ke liye mujhe tathaa prakashkon ko iskaa copirite de sakate hai? mere liye to yah vaisaa hi punyakarya ban chukaa tha jaisaa 1957 main nagar ji ke liye maatr 1,000 ru
 The original treatise on the government's honorarium would have been composed
 sharad ji kaa lautati dak se jawaab aayaa ki yadi main khud yah kaam kar rahi hum to unki sweekruti he
 He has also spoken to his late brother's son
 vah bhi raji he
 The publisher ran his envoy to Lucknow and acceptance came at hand
 sharad ji se phone par sampark tathaa patrachaar jari tha
 His constantly deteriorating health condition and deteriorating vision had almost made him sick
 phir bhi unki taraf se purnatipurna sahyog mila
 Within moments of battling with the pain and blindness of incurable disease, his well-deserved successor Diksha and Richa read him the preface of his book written on Rogashaiah
 richa ne bataaya ki pustak ke masaude ko haath se choote hue unki tippanee thi, “ab mujhe dawa kii jarurat nahin rahi
 "it would be a heartbreak for me to grieve that he had passed away before the book came out
 par is anuwaad kaa puraa shrey unheen kaa he, main to shaayad vidhanaa dwaara kuch samay tak niyukt unka pitrurin or nagar ji kii anany mitra tathaa pathika apni maa shivani kaa matrurin chukaane kaa ek nimitt bhar thi
 Sharad ji has written with great neatness and decency in his article Ghadar Phool composition (A Sun Remembers) specially written on my request on the composition of this book, how to renounce the suffocating job of Akashwani's drama producer in 1956 Kar nagar ji had taken voluntary service liberation
 aajeevika kaa sangharsh jari rahaa par lekhan kabhi nahin chuta
 Tales of Gadar were part of Nagar ji's childhood spent in Allahabad
 lakhanu aa basane ke baad sthaneey mitron or unke pariwaron se bhi uski babat anek malumat hasil hote rahe
 He made up his mind to write a novel trilogy with elaborate plank on the background of Gadar
 “mujhe laga ki apane upanyaas ke kshetra avadh main gum-ghumkar gadar sambandhi smritiyaan or kinvadantiyaan aadi ekatra kiye bina meri gadhi hui kahani main jhekole rah jaaenge
 
 
 Gall of history can be identified only with the help of folklore
 hamaare desh main swajanon kii chita ke phool chune jate hai
 Right after a hundred years, i also started organizing the yatra of Awadh with the commitment to choose the flowers of Gadar
 
 
 ” (nagar ji, pratham sanskaran kii bhoomika se)
 Job was not there, it was difficult to collect information from village to village on the basis of private resources
 isiilie pradesh sarkaar kii taraf se 1957 main gadar kii shatee samaaroh ke liye sansmaranon se bhari yah pustika likhane kaa prastaav unako rucha
 What if the wages were less? Was the government giving the facility of travel and accommodation? So in the words of Sharad ji, "
 
 
 ba (patni) ne unka jhela sajaa diya or 4 june 1957 ko babuji ne chappalein fatfatate ghar se nikal apni yatra kaa pehla daur shuru kiya
 
 
 "I am aware of my author's mother's innocent life, how much does an honest Hindi writer have total status?" Our author mother also often used to recite the lines of 'sudama Charit', "ya gahneh kahoon na gaya piya, tuto tawa aru futi kathouti
 
 
 ” so nagar ji ke jhole main bhi na tepe recorder tha, na camera
 As a tool, there were some pads of different sizes, 3-4 pencils, pencil sharpeners, pens and a couple of rumpled school copies given by a newspaper worker Balasakha
 do-chaar jodi kapade or nirantar sahchar unka pandibba
 There was not even time to copy by hand
 roj sarkari ratrinivas main akasar laalaten kii roshni main nagar ji us din jamaa kii saamagree ko likhakar lakhanu bhijwate or ferme chhapate rahete
 Not available until manuscript of this book
 nigodi pencil kii likhaai samay ke saath akasar dhoomil jo ho gai thi
 When Sharad ji asked why the draft was not written with a pen? Nagar ji's naive reply was that he also kept a constant watch on the speaker's gestures and tactics, so suddenly he felt more comfortable writing a pencil than taking the risk of repaying Siyahi
 gadar ke phool kii takat or uski maarmikata kaa rahasy kahin khud lekhak kii isi bebaak, satat janakendrit drushti main chipa he
 They do not make a clever attempt to give a literary touch to the natural language of their pastoral sources, nor steal the eyes from some malicious aspects of the erstwhile society, even while reflecting on the pious memory of all the known and unknown martyrs of Gadar
 madhya 19veen sadi ke patansheel samaaj se unako prem nahin tha, lekin tamaam sadaandh ke bich baar-baar dikhanewaale maanviya tyaag, sahakaarita or karunaa ko bhi pustak andekha nahin karti
 Through his sharp eyes, readers may for the first time suddenly see that in this war Beva Rani Jhansi, Begum Hazrat Mahal (who was once bought by the Kutnis for the harem of Awadh Nawab), Rani of Tulsipur and Tawaifs of Kanpur Like women suddenly cut open their shackles and made open participation, how historical and sheer for the Indian Raj Samaj and the women who have been crushed under male suzerainty New kind Aऌhadkari experience proved
 nagar ji ko itihaas se vishesh prem tha or itihaas main bhi bharat ke itihaas se, usamen bhi avadh ke attharah sau sattaavanee itihaas se jisamen maujuud raja benny maadho, devibaksh singh, balbhadra singh or janganama ke lekhak sareekhe paatro se
 The reason? Nagar ji himself wrote in one of his letters “
 
 
 1857 i
 Even after all the rivers in the country were left in Oudh, the thunderbolt of India continued to beat like a soft flower
 
 
 ”21 july se 16 sitambar, 1957 ke bich likhi gai pustak ke anuwaad, tathaa sampadak mandal ke suzav par nae pathakon kii sahuuliyat ke liye apni taraf se maine usamen bich-bich main tatkaaleen avadh ke raaj samaaj tathaa bhugolic avasthitiyon or tatkaaleen prashasnic ikaayiyon kii babat kuch byore jode hai
 Just say this before him: Tvadiyam item Govindamad Tubhyamev dedayam
 nagar ji kii amritaswarupa kriti kaa yah swaroop bhi unki punya smriti ko samarpit
 The writer is a senior journalist and litterateur rashtriya jaanch agency yani enie ko desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 But in the last four years, the manner in which this agency wrote the words of failure in many cases, its credibility was weakened
 ek ke baad ek kai ahm maamalon main enie vifal hoti rahi or kai daagi kamjor jaanch kii vajah se chhutate rahe
 In such a situation, the work of the agency is also questionable
 kai baar aisa laga ki agency kii jaanch aropiyon ko doshi sabit karne ke liye thi hi nahin
 a weak charge sheet and lack of evidence testifies to this
 enie par kaaryastylee par sawaal isliye bhi uth rahe hai kyonki jin bade maamalon main wo vifal rahi unamem se sabhi aise cese the jinke aadhaar par upie sarkaar ne hindu aatankwaad kaa jumala uchhaala tha
 However, the NIA was formed by the UPA in 2009

 The investigation continued
 2014 main sarkaar badali, nizaam badla or agency kaa ravaiya bhi badal gaya
 As a result, the court, while delivering its verdict in the case, acquitted all the five accused, including the main accused, Swami Aseemanand, for lack of evidence
 sibiai ne 2010 main sabase pehle aseemanand ko hi giftaar kiya tha, lekin 2017 main use jamaanat mil gai thi
 Surprisingly, the NIA did not even appeal to a higher court to revoke his bail in such a sensitive case
 is ghatana main 160 chashmadid gavaahon ke bayaan darj kiye gaye the
 But 54 witnesses turned hostile
 april 2011 main is cese ko enie ko saunpa gaya

 varsh 2011 main is maamle kii jaanch enie ko saunpi gai
 The NIA filed a charge sheet against 5 people on 26 June 2011
 jisamen naaba kumaar urf swami aseemanand, sunil joshi, ramchandra kaalsangra, sandip daange or lokesh sharma kaa naam shaamil tha
 The effect of change of government also appeared on this matter
 varsh 2014 main hi samjhauta express blast cese ke aaropee swami aseemanand ko zamaanat mil gai
 In court, the NIA could not provide sufficient evidence against Aseemanand
 isliye wo reeha ho gaya
 Ajmer Sharif Dargah Blast 2007 There was a massive blast in the world famous Ajmer Sharif Dargah at around 6:30 pm on October 11, 2007
 is blast main 3 logon kii maut ho gai thi, jabaki 15 log ghayal hue the
 During the investigation of the case, the agencies recorded the statements of a total of 184 witnesses, of which 26 witnesses later retracted their statements
 mukarne vaale gavaahon main jharkhand ke mantri randhir singh bhi shaamil the
 After preliminary investigation, some people were arrested, including some accused who had confessed to the blast in front of the magistrate
 pehle maamle kii jaanch sibiai ke paas thi
 The investigation was later handed over to the NIA via the ATS
 is maamle main giraftaar ek shaks ne poochtacha main swami aseemanand kaa zikr kiya tha
 After that he was arrested on 19 November 2010 from the ashram in Haridwar
 aresas ke prachaarak indresh kumaar or sadhvi pragna bhi is cese main sandigdh maane gaye the, lekin enie ne chargeshit main unka naam nahin likhaa, kyonki agency ke paas unke khilaaf paryaapt saboot nahin the
 Malegaon Blast 2008 In September 29, 2008, there was a massive blast in Maharashtra's Kamelgaon, in which 6 people were killed

 The chargesheet filed in the case had the names of 14 accused
 blast ke liye ardex dene or sajeesh rachane ke aarope main sadhvi pragna or karnal prasad purohit ko giraftaar kar kiya gaya tha
 The ATS was first investigated in this case, but later the investigation was handed over to the National Investigation Agency
 jaanch enie kar rahi thi
 But after the change of government at the Center, the approach of investigation also changed
 nateeja ye hua ki maalegaanv blast cese ke aaropee leftinent karnal shrikant purohit ko kuch maah pehle supreme court se jamaanat mil gai
 The NIA also gave a clean chit to Sadhvi Pragya
 intelligence beuro kii khufia report ke mutabik pakistani khufia agency iesai se training hasil kar chuke 15 se 20 aatanki bharat main pravesh kar chuke hai

 dilli main narendra or maharashtra main devendra
 44-year-old Devendra Fadnavis will take oath as 18th Chief Minister of Maharashtra very soon
 tej tarraar or vinamr rajaneta maane jane vaale fadanvis kaa gaiyr-raajnneetik pahalu bhi behad dilachasp he
 Let us introduce you to five such things of his personality, which you might not know
 1
 Once upon a time, you were surprised to know that Devendra Fadnavis used to do modeling at one time
 lekin yah modelling kisi chamakdaar parade par nahin, balki ek garment shop ke vigyapanon main numaya hoti thi
 He was persuaded by a friend of his for this task
 san 2006 main unki tasveeron vaale hording pashchimi nagpur main maheene bhar tak lage rahe the
 Fadnavis did this advertisement for free
 atal bihari vaajapeyine jab unhen kisi kaam se dilli bulaayaa or vah pahunche to atal ji ne unka 'aaie, aaie model ji' kahkar swaagat kiya
 2
 raajnneeti se ub gaye thedavendra fadanvis jab meyar the to ek samay unhen raajnneetik taur-tareeke bilkul pasand nahin aa rahe the
 At that time, Fadnavis thought that he would leave politics and go to London and study law further
 padhai ke baad vah supreme court main bataur vakil nai shuruyaat karnaa chaahate the
 But after a lot of respect from friends, he agreed not to do so
 3
 Wife Amrita Fadnavis, wife of elder officer Devendra in private bank, is Associate Vice President of Axis Bank
 pati ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad bhi unhone naukari jari rakhane kaa faisla kiya
 She will have to give an application in the bank that her husband's work area has been shifted to Mumbai, so she should be transferred
 4
 Devendra Fadnavis failed to break the record of youngest Chief Minister Sharad Pawar, but his 5-year-old daughter Divija definitely made the record
 vah mukhyamantri awaas main rahane vaali kisi mukhyamantri kii sabase kam umr kii beti ban jaaengi
 When Sharad Pawar became the Chief Minister of Maharashtra in 1978, he was 38 years old and his daughter Supriya Sule was 9 years old
 divija na sirf papa kii party kaa naam jaanati he balki shishe ke saamne khadey hokar devendra kii tarah bhaashan bhi detii he
 5
 mujeec kaa keedadevendra fadanvis sangeet ke bade shaukeen hai
 According to friends, he remembers hundreds of Hindi and Marathi songs
 unke dost sanjay bangale ne ek akhbaar ko bataaya, 'aap ek gaanaa shuru kiijie or devendra antara-dar-antara use aage badhaate jaaenge
 He remembers things very quickly
 'padhein: iphone ke mureed hai fadanvispadhen: fadanvis ke khilaaf hai dangon ke 22 cese Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said that no proposal for raising the price of LPG (LPG) is under consideration and the subsidy being given will continue

 Pradhan, who was on behalf of the bjp's Bihar unit to attend the civic reception for the elected mps from the state in Patna, denied any increase in the price of LPG cylinders and said, "the subsidy is being given in LPG cylinders And the price at which and the number which is being made available will be continued
 isamen parivartan karne kaa prastaav vichaaradhin nahin he
 He said that in the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the development work of Eastern India has been taken as a priority and measures for the development of this region are being considered
 mausam vibhaag kii ore se bihar main monsoon ke dauraan kam varsha hone ke purvanumaan par unhone kaha ki sarkaar kisaanon kii chintaa se waakif he
 Pradhan said, "the Modi government has taken cognizance of the Meteorological Department's fear of not getting good monsoon
" yah chintaa kii baat jarur he, parantu sarkaar is par puri tarah sachet he or kisaanon par iskaa prabhaav na pade, iske liye sarkaar koi na koi rasta nikaal legi
 When asked about the constant price increase in petrol and diesel, he said that during the last 10 years, due to the economic mismanagement of the government, inflation has increased and confidence in the government in the country and abroad was lost
 ab modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad vishwaas badha he or yahi kaaran he ki mudra bhi majboot hui he
 He said that there is no additional burden on the farmers, the government is committed to this and is concerned about the development of the farmers
 unhone kaha ki bihar main indian oil corporation (iosi) ke adhikariyon ke saath bhi baithak kar vah vichaar-vimarsh karenge
 When asked about the development of Bihar, Pradhan said that even during the election campaign, Modi has spoken about the development of the north-east states
 purvi bharat sarkaar kii praathamikta main he
 Pradhan said that the government is concerned about the development of infrastructure, economic policy, farmers and employment in these areas, and the idea for development of these areas is going on

 When i saw the news of Bombay's Taj Hotel on TV, what did i see that within two hours my name started coming in? baar-baar aane laga
 Vedic: There must be some reason for that? Saeed: The reason was just one
 pichhali sarkaar mere peeche haath dhokar padi hui thi
 His home minister Rehman Malik was my enemy
 usne mujhe jabardasti giraftaar kar liya
 Vedic: Your government has caught you? They must have some concrete evidence? Saeed: There was no proof or anything

 The government was insolvent

 By catching me he made America happy and took great help

 The High Court of Lahore dismissed my lawyers, yet Rahman's maneuver failed

 But Rahman arrested me again

 net Team India has retained an invincible order in the ICC World Cup against their arch-rivals Pakistan
 bharat ne ravivaar ko manchester ke old trevord maidan par pakistan ko 89 ranon se karaari shikast di
 Former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar is very angry with this defeat
 'rawalpindi express' ke naam se mashhoor rahe shoeb ne captain sarfaraj ahamed ko bharat ke khilaaf haar ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Captain k Shoaib Akhtar said on 10 You Tube that Sarfaraz captained without mind
 hamaari management bevakoof he or captain uskaa maamu bana hua he
 This captain is like the students of 10th class, which the management has said, just have to do the same
 shoeb akhtar ne kaha ki pradhanmantri imran khan ne match ko lekar itane twit kiye, lekin bina dimag ke captain ko kuch samaj main nahin aayaa
 By the way, Imran Khan should have tweeted for people who have capacity
 is team main capacity hi nahin he
 Putting a little Imran Khan in the captain, Dunshoeb said that after winning the toss in this match, the captain would have decided without bowling first
 sarfaraj ko yahi pataa nahin tha ki unki team strength kya he
 Pakistan could have bowled the match due to bowling
 agar pakistan kii team pehle batting karti to gendbaajon par dabaav kam hota, lekin brinles captain or management match haarane kii niyat se khel rahe the
 Shoaib Akhtar said, 'I was thinking that i should put a little Imran Khan in this brainless captain, but it was late
 'wagha border par chalaang lagane se acha tha match main lagateshoeb akhtar ne kaha ki bowling main hasan ali ne sabase ghatiya gendbaaji kii
 He said he made long jumps at the Wagah border, but was throwing shot pitch balls in the match
 vah agar apane ko bada gendbaaj tab samajhataa jab vikat nikaalata
 He said that Hasan Ali considers himself a T20 player
 piesel (pakistan super lig) khelkar hi vah khush he
 Bowling has no pace and no swing
 lakshya hasil karnaa hamaare itihaas main nahinshoeb akhtar ne kaha ki lakshya hasil karnaa hamaare itihaas main nahin rahaa he
 We also had veteran batsmen in the 1999 World Cup, but we could not achieve 227 runs against India
 agar manchester ke mukaable main pakistan pehle batting karke 270 ran bhi banaata to bharat use nahin hasil kar paata, lekin bina dimag kii captain kaa khamiyaja hamen bhugatna padaa
 The World Cup, not the Champions Trophy match, was Thasoeb Akhtar said, "actually, it was a Champions Trophy match
 is match main jo galati bharat ne kii thi, vahi galati pakistan ne is world cap main kii
 In the Champions Trophy, Virat Kohli decided to bowl first after winning the toss and Pakistan set a target of 339 runs
 jawaab main team india target nahin achiv kar pai
 Sarfaraz made the same mistake in this World Cup
 toss jitkar pehle gendbaaji kii or bharat ne 337 ranon kaa target de diya, jise paak team hasil nahin kar pai
 Rajya Sabha MP Amar Singh has targeted the statement of Akhilesh Yadav, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and National President of Samajwadi Party, who won the temple of Vishnu after winning the election
 amar singh ne fasebuk par ek video jari kiya he, jisamen unhone akhilesh yadav or ajam khan par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Amar Singh said that Akhilesh is not a socialist but a nominalist
 bataa den ki akhilesh yadav ne haal hi main kaha tha ki agar vah satta main aae to uttar pradesh main bhagwaan vishnu kaa nagar viksit kiya jayega or isamen bhavy mandir bhi hoga
 He said that this temple of Lord Vishnu will be like the world famous Ankorwat temple in Cambodia
 akhilesh or ajam khan par amar singh kaa yah gusse bharaa video he jisamen amar singh akhilesh ko samaajawaadee party kii jagah namaajawaadee party kaa adhyaksh bataa rahe hai
 Amar Singh's anger is most on Azam Khan
 vah apni betiyon par tejaab phenkane ke aazam khan ke kisi bayaan kaa hawala de rahe hai
 Amar Singh, once seen wearing a hat with Akhilesh Yadav, said, 'akhilesh you have every right to build a Vishnu temple, you are not the president of the Samajwadi Party, you are the president of the Namazwadi Party
 tumhaara banaaya hua or tumhaare pita kaa banaae hue raajnneetik putr ajaam khan ne bayaan diya ki amar singh jaise logon ko kaatna chahie
 Acid should be thrown on their young daughters
 'amar singh ne akhilesh yadav ke pariwarik jhagade kaa zikr karte hue un par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that i resolved his family feud
 lekin main jab musiibat main tha tab naa vah or naa hi unke pita meri or mere paariwaar kii sud lene aae
 Amar Singh said that, i cannot compromise my self-respect for secularism
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek kaarykram main rajyasabha saansad amar singh kii tarif kii thi
 Since then, Amar Singh has been vocal against the Samajwadi Party
 isse pehle unhone uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar main hue dange ko lekar akhilesh yadav par sawaal uthaae the
 The statement of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has been strongly criticized by Jammu and Kashmir BJP President Ravindra Raina
 unhone kaha, jab aap satta main rahenge, jab aapke paas sari sukh-suvidhaayen rahegi to aap bharat mata kii jayakaar or vande maataram kahenge
 When the people of Jammu and Kashmir will throw you out of power, you will remember Yasin Malik and Syed Salauddin
 yah bahut hi durbhagyapurna he
 'salauddin ruined Kashmiris' Ravindra Raina said, now you remember Yasin Malik and Syed Salauddin
 yah nindaneey he
 Yasin Malik and Salauddin have ruined Kashmiris
 jammu kashmir main jo kabristaan bane hai, yaccin malik jaise logon ne banaae hai
 Missing such people
 yah bahut hi dukhadai he
 Ravindra Raina said, we are the connecting people, not the breakers
 hamen jod tod se satta main aana hota to gathbandhan tuutane ke 10-15 dinon ke andar waapas sarkaar bana lete
 If there is anyone in our contact, then it is the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 raina ne kaha, antkavaadiyon or patharbaajon ne ramajaan ke maheene main kashmir ke srinagar main tandav kiya
 There innocent people were murdered, journalists were killed
 kanoon vyavastha vahaan charmara rahi thi
 As soon as Governor's rule is in place, the situation has started to get better
 jammu kashmir ke kharaab halaat ko control nahin kar pain mahabuubaravindra raina kaa kahana he ki mahabuuba mufti jammu kashmir ke kharaab halaat ko control nahin kar pain
 The package provided by the Central Government for development was also not implemented for the benefit of the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 patharbaajon ke hausale buland the
 The terrorists were strong
 kyonki unke khilaaf karrwai nahin kii gai
 They think that they will fool the people of Kashmir
 yah unki galatfahami he
 More than one lakh people have died in Kashmir, who is responsible for this
 raina ne kaha, wo kashmir kii mukhyamantri raheen or aisi gaiyr jimmedaarana baaten kar rahi hai
 Who murdered our children, women, youth from Pakistan with guns and ammunition
 jinhone kashmir kii aarthik sthiti barbaad kii
 Wasted all people
 hamaare bacchon ke skool, college, vishvavidhyalay band karwaae
 Kidnapped children on their way to school
 isko kashmir kii janata kabhi maaf nahin karegi
 On fixing the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Ravindra Raina said, "if we had so much greed for power, why would we come out of the coalition?" We have not come out because we had to manipulate the pieces of politics
 yahaan kanoon vyavastha puri tarah charmara gai thi
 In such a situation, we could not enjoy power happiness by clinging to power
 philhal sarkaar banane kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 It is our priority to fix the situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 kanoon vyavastha thik karnaa hamaari praathamikta he
 Ravindra Raina said, now as soon as the governor's rule starts, all the work has started recovering
 patharbaj aapako najar nahin aaenge
 Today, terrorists are covered in forests
 seemaa par ghuspaith karte hi maare jate hai
 We want to fix the situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 taaki jammu kashmir ke log anya praanton kii tarah sukh chaiyn kii saans le sake
 So that i can live my life with respect
 jammu kashmir ke 99% log hindustan kii baat karte hai
 There are 1% people who take money from Pakistan and work at their behest
 kashmir kii janata inako chodengi nahin
 Let me tell you, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti has warned the Modi government at the Center that if the BJP tries to break the PDP in the state, many more Salauddin will be born in Kashmir and the state's condition like 90s Will be done

 The Congress has won the political battle of Rajasthan
 iske baad mukhyamantri pad kii daavedaari ko lekar chali lambii rassakashi ke bich ashok gahalot sachin payalat par baari padate najar aa rahe hai
 After meeting Rahul Gandhi with Congress observers and both leaders, Gehlot's name is being considered almost certain
 yani congress yuva netaa par anubhav ko tarjeeh detii dikh rahi he
 In this game of checkmate, Gehlot once again got overwhelmed
 najar daalate hai donon netaaon kii khoobiyon or khaamiyon par
 After all, how did Gehlot get ahead
 ashok gahalotatakat1
 Long experience of politics- Ashok Gehlot has been the Chief Minister of Rajasthan twice and this is his biggest strength
 choti umr main pradesh adhyaksh ban gaye the
 2
 rahul ke kareebi- congress ke kendriya sanghathan main sanghathan mahasachiv ke pad par kabiz
 It is a powerful position and is counted among the leaders closest to Rahul
 3
 Good penetration among Congress workers in all districts of Rajasthan
 4
 Specializes in keeping all castes of the state intact
 bujurg netaaon ke bich gahari paith
 5
 bataur siem apni kai yojanaon kii vajah se janata ke bich acchhee chhavi
 Weakness 1
 gahalot vidhansabha chunaav haarane ke baad se rajasthan se zyada dilli kii siyasat main sakriy hai
 2
 rajasthan main vasundhara raaje ke khilaaf sangharsh se dur rahe
 3
 pradesh main un par gutbaji kaa aarope lagata rahaa he
 Also accused of not allowing Sachin Pilot to work openly
 4
 Gehlot's aging may be a hindrance in his path to becoming CM
 ve 77 saal ke hai
 5
 gahalot saini samaaj se aate hai, is samaaj kii aabaadi rajasthan main mahaj 3 fisadi he
 Sachin Pilotqat 1
 sachin payalat party ke yuva chehre hai
 Being close to Congress President Rahul Gandhi is his biggest strength
 2
 Since becoming the Congress state president, Pilot has continuously struggled against Vasundhara Raje to create an anti-incumbency
 party ko 21 se 99 siton tak pahunchane main ahm bhoomika rahi
 3
 dilaai kamyaabi- payalat ke netritv main paanch saal main jitne bhi chunaav or upachunaav hue sabhi congress ne jite
 These include four assembly and two Lok Sabha seats
 4
 Away from any kind of controversy and conflicting statements
 5
 He has emerged as a leader of gentle, decent, serious and positive politics
 kamajori1
 The biggest weakness in Sachin Pilot becoming CM, his caste is coming in the way
 wo gurjar samudaay se aate hai or pradesh main bahut bada votbank nahin he
 2
 siem jaisaa pad sanbhaalane kaa anubhav nahin he
 3
 bujurg netaaon ke bich paith nahin
 There are a large number of elderly leaders who are not in favor of becoming their CM
 4
 There is no penetration in all areas and all caste groups in the state
 5
 Being external - Pilots are originally from UP
 aise main rajasthan se baahar ke hone ke chalate yah bhi ek kamajori he

 haal hi main release hui film 'dam lagaake haisha' se dher sari vaahvahee or pahchaan banane vaali abhinatri bhoomi pednekar ne kaha he ki meraa motopa yaa mere vazan se mujhe kabhi takalif nahin hui

 Before this film, Bhoomi used to cast other actors in films

 At present, the film 'dum Lagaake Haisha' is highly appreciated and Bhoomi's acting is being highly appreciated
 bhoomi ne hamase bataaya ki mujhe ummid nahin thi ki is film ko itnaa jabardast rispance milegaa

 Amongst the big movies earning 39 crores rights, Amrit Kaushik is the first film as a woman
 laagat ke mukaable sarvaadhik profit kamaane ke maamle main ye film saal kii 7 badi filmon main shaamil ho chuki he
 It is also worth noting that compared to other big films released this year, the woman got less screens
 abhi film box offis par jis hisaab se pradarshan kar rahi he, ho saktaa he ki ye sarvaadhik profit kamaane vaali saal kii sabase badi film ban jaae
 "sonu Ke Titu ki Sweety" 84 made in 24 crores according to Koi Moiqi report
 71 karod ke shuddh laabh ke saath saal kii sarvaadhik profit kamaane vaali filmon main sheersh par he
 Apart from Rajkumar Rao, the film stars Shraddha Kapoor, Pankaj Tripathi, Aparshakti Khurana and Abhishek Banerjee
 abhi bahut din to hue nahin, mushkil se teen-chaar saal hi to hue hai, jab yah desh kabhi jantar-mantar, to kabhi ramlila maidan par josh main garajtaa tha
 For weeks or months, there were slogans to remove corruption and bring Lokpal
 desh ke chote-chote kasbon tak main ‘main bhi anna’ kaa naaraa or candal march karata tha
 Today it cannot be said that the motives of all those who were doing this were very pure and their hidden intentions were nothing else, but it cannot be denied that the youngsters had dreams of change in the humming they had done
 ek aisa bharat banane kaa khwab tha, jiskaa duniya main ahm mukaam ho
 The young generation was making tremendous use of their new hobby i
e
 social media in this work
 usase thodaa or pehle jaaen to desh chamchamaate airport, behatar hote railway stesan, jeene kii aarthik aazaadee detii naregaa, pradhanmantri gramin sadq yojana, sasti mobile seva, aadhaar card kii sthapana ke jariye har naagarik kaa data bank or i-duniya se judane main juta tha
 The same country was desperate to write the meaning of economic development after the most efficient exit from the recession that started in 2008
 aisa nahin he ki in sab baton main sirf haraa hi haraa ho, dher sari aalochana is aakhyaan ke saath chalati thi
 But that criticism was also good, because it was related to a positive issue
 is aalochana ke aaine main garvila bharat baar-baar apana cheharaa dekhtaa tha or jarurat ke mutabik mechap karke aage badhata tha
 In this discourse, beef, hindu-muslim quarrels, homecoming, regnal views of the regent in the medieval era were not regressive thoughts
 in madhyayugin muddon ko to bharat ne 15veen-16veen sadi ke bhaktikaal main hi desh nikaala dena shuru kar diya tha
 After that, the Renaissance started from the 18th century once again brought forward the point of progressive India
 1857 kii ladaai to khayr angreji daur ke bharat kii samuhik chetana kaa pehla namoona thi hi
 After that Congress was formed, Bapu came, Nehru started the leadership of the country, constitution was made, things of development and Bharat Nirman started
 kareeb 400 saal kii mehnat ke baad bharat us kathmullaapan ko apane samaaj kii mukhyadhara se khadedane main bahut had tak kaamyaab rahaa, jo aaj bhi hamaare padosi mulkon, khadi deshon or africa ke bade hisse ko chapet main liye he
 At the beginning of the Modi government, which was most enthusiastic after 30 years, everything was fine, at least in Jumlebaazi, then things like bullet train, modern city, Achhe Din, Swachh Bharat, Digital India, Jan Dhan were happening
 rail ko raftaar dene or road ko sarapat banane kii baaten thim
 For a year, the Prime Minister did not get free time just by inaugurating the schemes which reached the last stage of the UPA era
 mangalayan or vaishnodevi tak train kii aamad kuch aisi hi khushnuma tarakkee pasand ghatnaayen thim
 Till that time the media also did not find much opportunity to criticize, because the government was being given the desired honeymoon period
 lekin is tyohaari maahaul ko sattadhari party kaa hi ek dhada pachaa nahin paaya
 He always felt that issues like Ram temple, Hindu Rashtra, Article 370, which had become part of his thinking, have been left out of the debate
 unka apana netaa duniya kii salaami le rahaa he, lekin un vishyon par na kuch bolta he, na kuch karata he, asal main jo uske mul gun maane ja rahe the
 Even after Modi declared himself a carrier of development, this hardline faction was seeing the poster boy of Hindutva in him
 yah to ram hi jaane ki modi apane antaraman main khud ko vikaspurush maan rahe the yaa poster bvaay
 The chaos remained, but the defeat of the Delhi Assembly elections overcame the chaos
 muktibodh kii bhashaa udhaar len to ‘dimagi guha andhkaar kaa orangutang’ insaan kaa jism fadkar baahar nikal aayaa
 In which language is this Orangoutang speaking, how is it doing the deeds, it is twisting the arms of the emerging India all over the world
 sahityakaron kii puraskaar vaapasi ke jariye sarkaar duniya main ho rahi ninda ke asar ko gharelu aawaaj se samaj sakati thi
 But this mockery is being mocked
 unke mantri us aurangzeb se khaase prabhavit ho gaye hai, jiskaa naam haal hi main ek road se hataaya gaya
 It is said that Aurangzeb, being a musician, had become opposed to literature, music and arts
 aise main sankethik virodh karne ke liye padhe likhe logon ne sangeet kii arthi nikaali
 But instead of understanding the intentions, Aurangzeb said, 'no notes could be made to bury it so low
 ’ itihaas gavaah he ki ashishnu swabhaav vaala badshaah aakhri nami mughal banakar rah gaya
 And after the scholar like Chanakya was ridiculed in the full court, everyone knows the story of the fall of the Nanda Empire
 to pataa nahin pradhanmantri is aurangutang ko pinjre main daalkar, phir se sabakaa vikaas ke kaam par kab se waapas lautate hai
 By the way, this work should start after the result of Bihar assembly elections
 lekin yah itnaa aasaan bhi nahin he
 But the country is expecting its Prime Minister that he will spend the remaining three and a half years to build the best India
 jaahir he, yah shreshth bharat samvidhan se bandhaa hoga, na ki kisi vichaardhaara se
 And the path of this India will go through better social dialogue, let us see when it starts
 "main pichley dinon duniya ke kai deshon main gaya
 Wherever i went, i had a poor village-farmer in India
 main australia gaya
 Where did you go? 
 
 ?" bheed se jawaab aata he, australia
 Prime Minister Modi also says, "I went to Australia
 vahaan kii uniwarsity ke vaigyanikon se mila
 For what work
 maine kaha ki hamaare kisaan kheti karte hai, mung, arhar or chane kii kheti karte hai, lekin ek acre bhoomi main jitani paidaavaar honi chahie, utani nahin hoti
 The land cannot grow, but if the family has to run in that much land, then how should our production increase per acre
 hamane vahaan ke vaigyanikon ke saath milakar us kaam ko aage badhaane kaa tay kiya he, jiske kaaran mere bharat ke chote kisaan, garib kisaan kam zamin ho, to bhi zyada utpaadan kar saken, taaki unke parivaar ko dukh kii naubat na aae
 i have done this work in Australia
 " In Daltonganj, Jharkhand, hardly any Prime Minister or leader in any part of the country will start his speech by visiting Australia and Japan
 soshal media se lekar media tak main modi ke videsh dauron kii aalochana ho rahi thi
 Today's Economic Times has a report that he spent 31 days abroad in five months, traveled to eight countries
 vipakshi dal aalochana kar rahe the ki yah enarai pradhanmantri hai
 Jokes were being made on social media that pmo's extension counter would open in foreign countries as well
 in aalochanaon main modi ko ghoomane-phirane vaale pradhanmantri ke rup main pesh kiya gaya
 Modi too did not do anything secretly
 samundar ke kinare photo khinchate hue tasviir khinchvaai or soshal media par baant diya, jaise tasviir khinchne ke liye unke paas bahut vakt rahaa ho
 Reached Myanmar and sent the picture on Instagram
 kuch log bahubhashi hote hai, narendra modi bahumadhyamaa hai
 He is also multilingual in terms of Gujarati, Hindi and English, but the way he uses the medium, no one else is doing it
 pradhanmantri har vakt samvaad ke nae-nae madhyamon kii talash main rahete hai
 Communicate in such a way that it becomes a challenge for those who study dialogue
 ek dilachasp chunauti, jiskaa lagaataar adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 It is true that his spoken words are yet to be tested in proportion to the work, but are happening, but Modi also fights these criticisms in his own way
 kisi ne sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki videsh yatraaon ko lekar ho rahi aalochanaon ko vah janata ke bich kisi khubi main badal denge
 With his quick tricks, he is constantly duping opponents
 mujhe maaloom nahin ki unke dauron par likhane waalon ne apane sampadakeey lekhon main yah likhaa bhi he yaa nahin ki pradhanmantri australia kii uniwarsity main prati acre utpaadan badhaane kii baat karne gaye the, kele main vitamin kii kshamta badhaane par vichaar karne gaye the
 It may have been written and tweeted by Foreign Ministry spokesman Akbaruddin Saheb
 akbaruddin behad kaabil pravaktaa hai, lekin jharkhand kii garib janata ke bich vah bataa aae ki unka videsh daura daramil kootneeti ke nafis vidwaanon ke liye nahin, aap garib logon ke liye tha
 “banana is produced in our country
 kelaa ek aisa fal he, jo garib bhi kabhi-kabhi kha saktaa he, lekin vaigyanik tareeke se unke andar zyada vitamin kaise aaen, zyaada louh tatv aaen, taaki kelaa maatayen-bahanen khaaen to prasuti ke samay jo baccha paidaa ho, vah taqatvar paidaa ho
 If our children eat bananas, then there is a decrease in their eyes, the strength of the eyes decreases at a young age, if there is more vitamin a in the banana, then our children get vitamin A, also get iron, to research this Have decided to pursue the work with the University of Australia
 yah kaam garibon ke liye kiya he
 " kisi videsh daure kaa aisa garibeekaran yaa desikaran maine pehle nahin dekha
 It may have been done by earlier Prime Ministers, but i am seeing this work happening for the first time in my memory
 koi pradhanmantri kelaa main vitamin e or louh tatv badhaane kii baat kar rahaa he
 He suddenly becomes everything from a doctor to a scientist in front of a voter
 ab aisi sthiti main janata unki baton par yakeen nahin karegi to kya karegi, isiilie main lagaataar ek saal se kah rahaa hum ki narendra modi kaa vikalp vahi netaa banegaa, jo unke har bhaashan ko sunegaa, chunauti dene kii kaat nikaalega
 Nitish Kumar has done an interesting experiment
 vah apane kaaryakartaaon ke bich modi ke pehle or baad ke bhaashanon ko sunaate hai or phir apni tippanee karte hai
 The national media has ignored this experiment of Nitish, but this way of catching Modi is interesting
 kam se kam samvaad or sampreshan ke vidhyaarthiyon ko dekhnaa chahie ki narendra modi apane samvaad kaushal se virodhiyon ke samvaad kaushal ko kis tareeke se badal rahe hai
 Then i said that he is a challenge for the students of communication
 kitni chaturaai se unhone apni japan yatra ko adivaasiyon ke kalyaan se jod diya
 On 31 August, the Times of India also wrote that Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Shinya Yamanaka regarding the disease of 'sickle cell anemia'
 shinya yamanaka ko stem cell main shodh ke liye varsh 2012 kaa nobel prize mila tha
 The disease is found in tribal areas of India
 narendra modi ne apni us mulaakaat ko jharkhand kii janata ke bich is tarah pesh kiya ki unka videsh dauron par janaa kitna zaruri he
 They turn that meeting into an anecdote
 kehane lagate hai ki main japan main nobel prize vaigyanik se milane gaya
 i said that my tribal siblings in India are victims of family illness for centuries
 agar maa-baap ko beemaari he to bacchon ko beemaari ho jaati he or aaj duniya main isaki koi dawaai nahin he, to aap is disha main shodh kaa kaam kiijie, bharat kharchaa karne ke liye taiyaar he, jiske kaaran mere adivasee pariwaron ko is beemaari se mukt kiya ja sake
 Modi is an issue for his opponents, but for Modi his opponents are not an issue
 vah janata se samvaad karte hai
 Do not face the media's questions and answers, but by changing everything in their stories, they give a new thing to the public
 daltonganj kii raily se lautati bheed yah bhul chuki hogi ki mahangaai se lekar kaale dhan par pradhanmantri ne to kuch bolaa nahin, vah yahi baat kar rahi hogi ki pradhanmantri ko yah bhi pataa he ki kele main koun-sa vitamin he, loha kaise badhaayaa ja saktaa he, vah hamaare bacchon ke swasthya kii baat karte hai, adivaasiyon kii beemaari thik kar dene kii baat karte hai
 Now you keep criticizing his foreign tour
 ranneetik samjhauton kii baarikiyon par seminar karte rahiye, vah daltonganj kii janata ko bataa aae ki kelaa or khandaani beemaari kii dawa dhundne ke liye videsh-videsh gum rahe the
 The Prime Minister becomes like a Baba who can dispel all worries
 baba hi nahin, ek vaigyanik bhi ban jate hai, jo kisi lab main vitamin se lekar aayran tak par research karvaa rahaa he
 Modi changes himself whenever he feels that the Prime Minister's speech has become repetitive
 vah kuch nayaa bolne lag jate hai
 From the truth of these things, there can be political analysis of claims, there can also be a debate about factual mistakes, but no leader has such cleverness and confidence to communicate
 yah lekh likhte hue peeche tivi par modi ke baad jammu-kashmir ke bandipur se sonia gandhi ke bhaashan kaa prasaaran hone laga
 It seems that they have nothing new
 unke paas koi kissa nahin he
 There is no dream
 kam se kam kashmir ke seb main kisi nae vitamin ko badhaane ke sankalp kaa sapana to dikhaa hi sakati thim
 Sonia also said that she will improve the research institutes, but could not turn them into stories
 dhar paidaa nahin kar sakin
 Actually, communication skills in our politics will now create a new challenge
 jo modi ke bhaashanon kaa hi nahin, unke kiye jane vaale kaam kaa koi thos vikalp pesh kar sake
 Have to present a different dream
 alag tareeke se bolnaa hoga

 video ko viral hota dekh chini sensor chaunkanna ho gaya or isse judi khabaron or video ko news site se bhi hataa diya he

 During this process of thinking, his gesture also plays a very important role

 Halberstadt explained that we imagine our emotional expression as ambiguous ways of communicating how we feel, but physical interactions act as a blending of many emotions in interactions that occur in real social contexts
 
 unhone bataaya ki iskaa matlab do logon ke bich ek jaisi bhaawanaaon ko lekar alag-alag manyataayen ho sakati hai or donon jo dekhte hai us babat sahi bhi ho sakate hai

 What connection can Sunanda Pushkar's death have with Pakistan or Dubai? This question may be astonishing, but the Delhi Police is now investigating the same aspect to solve the puzzle of Sunanda's ten-month-old death
 darasal dilli police ko shaq he ki sunanda kii maut se kuch din pehle tak koi aisa tha jo lagataar unka peechha kar rahaa tha
 Not only this, the police has also found some such evidence that some special things had disappeared from Sunanda's room immediately after death
 sunanda kii maut ke takreeban das maheene baad dilli police ab un logon kii list khangaal rahi he jo sunanda kii maut se ain pehle dubai yaa pakistan se dilli aae the
 The Delhi Police suspects that someone outside India may be behind Sunanda's death
 police ke isi shaq se ye bhi ishaara mil rahaa he ki wo sunanda kii maut ko mahaz khudakushi nahin, balki ek pland murder yani sochi-samajhi sajeesh ke nazariye se bhi dekh kar maamsale kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Delhi Police has sought details of every traveler coming to Delhi from Pakistan and Dubai before the death of Sunanda from FRRO, the Regional Regional Registration Office
 iske saath hi wo hotel lila pales ke sisitivi footage ko bhi nae sire se khangaal rahi he, taaki agar in mulkon se aayaa koi shaks maut se ain pehle hotel lila pales main najar aayaa ho to, sari kadiyon ko joda ja sake
 You will remember that before the death, Sunanda was upset about her husband Shashi Tharoor's alleged relationship with Pakistani woman journalist Meher Tarar
 pati-patni ke bich soshal cites par bhi ise lekar nok-jhonk hui thi
 Even Sunanda accused Mehr Tarar of ties with the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI
 iske alaava sunanda akasar dubai bhi aati-jaati rahati thim
 In such a case, if the suspicion of the police rests on a person coming from Pakistan or Dubai, then it is bound to be crooked
 sunanda ke jism main mili jehar kii pechidagi is maamle ko pehle hi khaasaa ulajhaa chuki he
 In the forensic investigation conducted so far, it is clear that his death was due to poison, but even the nation's scapegoat could not know the name and type of poison found in his body
 aise main ab police us jehar ko samajhane ke liye sunanda kii visra ke namoonay england yaa scotland ke kisi forensik lab main bhejne kii taiyaari main he
 In the recently published Visara report of Sunanda, the doctors had confirmed the death of Sunanda due to poison, but also said that the kind of poison found in his body is not possible in the laboratories of India
 haalanki shaq ke taur par in forensik exparts ne saanp ke jehar se lekar radioective isotops tak kaa zikr kiya tha
 On one side is the foreign connection of Sunanda's death and on the other, the mysterious disappearance of some things from her room
 ji haa, sananda kii maut kii mistry ko lekar ye nayaa khulaasa hua he
 According to Delhi Police sources, some of Sunanda's clothes and sandals were mysteriously missing from her room
 aapako yaad hoga sananda kii maut dilli ke panchasitara hotel main hui thi
 On one hand, the Delhi Police is scouting the list of people who have transported Delhi from Pakistan to Dubai to know the truth of Sunanda's death, while another new truth surfaced from Sunanda's room in Hotel Leela Palace, these officers engaged in investigation
 And that is true, of the disappearance of some things from Sunanda's room
 sutron kaa kahana he ki sunanda kii mautke baad uske kamare se uske kuch kapade or sandals gaayab ho gaye the or to or sunanda kaa wo kapadaa bhi police ko nahin mila, jise pahan kar wo is hotel ke apane kamare main daakhil hui thim
 In such a situation, the question is, how and where did these things disappear from this room during Sunanda's death? Did someone intentionally remove these things from the room? And if so, why? Did the person who lost Sunanda's clothes and sandals want to hide something? It is obvious that the police need to do a lot of fresh work on these questions
 isi saal 19 janvari ko sunanda kii postmortem report main ye khulaasa hua tha ki unki maut dawa ke overdoj kii vajah se hui he
 In fact, on January 17, Sunanda's corpse was found in the five-star hotel room where two empty leaves of Alprax tablets were found with the corpse
 donon pattey main kul tees tablet the
 But now after the viscera report came out, it was found that Sunanda did not take a single shot of Alprax before she died
 yani dawa ke overdoj se maut hui hi nahin

 In 1994, in ninth class, this student of Saraswati Vidya Mandir again came to the Government Inter College and the Sangh, the BJP, expected from here
 ise bhi padhein
 
 
 Read the 5 poems of Atal, 'I lived a lot, i die of my heart', i had gone away from the Sangh and BJP
 kuch rashtriya-antarrashtriya padaadhikariyon se milane jaataa tha
 Used to argue with them
 sangh ke andar khokhli hoti naitiktaaon se lekar jati or kaaryakarta ke mahatv par sawaal uthaata rahaa
 The 1999 election came in this series
 pitaaji ke puraane mitra arun nehru raibareli aae to sabase pehle hamaare ghar pahunche
 He said that you have to campaign for me
 wo bhaajapa pratyaashee the
 Sanjay Singh also took similar promise from Amethi
 donon camel nishaan par chunaav lard rahe the
 Promoted for both
 atalji se antim mulaakaat isi dauraan raibareli main unki raily ke manch par hui
 After my speech, Atal ji came on stage and we all heard his speech
 haalanki agali shaam usee maidan main priyanka gandhi kii raily hui or priyanka ke bhaashan ne chunaav badal diya
 Arun Nehru lost
 iske baad atal ji pradhanmantri the or main unka virdohi
 i disagreed with him from disinvestment to privatization
 mujhe atal ji kii sarkaar apane mul siddhanton ke khilaaf jaati dikh rahi thi
 i was able to see that the slogans that the Sangh had made us swear in the name of Swadeshi, who asked to sing songs and worship the country, whose resources were considered as mother, is standing against it
 tab se lekar ajtak main bhaajapa kii raajnneeti se sahamat nahin ho sakaa
 i saw the expansion of the Congress in the BJP
 upar se unka sampradayik agenda or asahmatiyon ko raundne kii aaj kii pravriti use or bhi vikrut kar detii he
 Atal ji is a different question here
 or atal ko samajhane ke liye kuch der ke liye unhen patibaddhtaon ke us chashme se dekhnaa hoga jisase kisi bhi kaaryakarta ko dekha janaa chahie, phir chaahe wo vam kaa ho yaa dakshin kaa
 Atal remained committed to his ideology
 eemaandaar rahe
 But he also had a commitment to politics
 desh or loktantr ke prati bhi thi
 That is why, keeping the ideology moving forward, Atal kept listening to other ideologies, always kept a dialogue with them
 vipaksh main rahete hue bhi puure sadan ko suna or puure sadan kaa vishwaas paaya
 This is a big deal in politics
 sir par islamic topi pahanane kii baat ho, khan-paan main khulepan kii baat ho, pakistani kalakaaron kaa ilaaj karana yaa eemaandaar chhavi ke adhikariyon ko bachaana
 Vajpayee continued to do so much which was never included in the character of any other leader of his party
 unhone sangh ko bhi suna or santusht rakhaa lekin sangh ke baahar ke netaaon ko bhi party main jagah di or majboot kiya
 In politics, they have to make compromises and they have to make those agreements too
 lekin ye samjhaute or saath lekar chalane kii gunjaaish hi to loktantr kii takat he
 Vajpayee was alone among himself as he did not lag behind adopting strangers
 jinhen apnaava unhen sammaan bhi diya or sthaan bhi
 While in BJP, he was repeatedly told that he is a right leader who is in the wrong party
 aisa kai baar prathit bhi hota he
 But the politician, the most popular poet of the BJP till now, never made the party small even when he grew up
 sangh se kai asahmatiyon ke baavjood sangh ko itnaa kamazor nahin kiya ki wo unpar ashrith ho jaae
 Today BJP and Sangh have become kurtas and pajamas of a particular person
 us aadmi ko hataate hi donon jameen par aa girane jaise hai
 In any democracy, memorable heroes are able to become those who do not run directly towards the sky like timber trees but become mango, peepal trees
 jinamein jhukne kii gunjaaish ho
 Be courteous and ashamed
 jo bhashaa or samvaad main ek buniyadi naitikta banaae rakhen
 Those who have one mouth have two ears
 atal apni vichaardhaara ko nibhaate hue kam se kam wo aam ke ped to bane hi rahe
 There are rules of war too
 uski bhi ek naitikta hoti he
 Today, despite many disagreements, there is also respect for Atal ji and the sadness of his departure
 maut ke chutkuledrasal, duniya main koi bhi aalochana se pare nahin he
 It is your vision that what good can you get from that evil
 atal kii mrityu kii khabar aane ke baad se hi shok ke saath-saath aalochanaon kaa bhi jowar dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 When i see mourning, i find that people of every political party and ideology are remembering him
 sabase ascharyajanak he pakistan main unke liye shok kii lahar
 People are remembering the leader who created the scope of movement of people across borders
 aalochana bhi ho rahi hai or honi bhi chahie
 But becoming unethical while criticizing is the same mistake for which we curse our adversary
 agar hamaari aalochana kii bhashaa hamen fasivadi bana rahi he to behatar he ki chup rahaa jaae
 We may be a disagreeable society in front of Atal, but we can learn so much about how ideology and the country can be fulfilled
 kaise wo gunjaaish rakhi ja sakati he jo aaj na to bhaajapa main he or na hi congress main
 Not even among the Left
 vichaardhaaraon kii kai daaliyon par abtak udata hua main baar-baar pahunchaa hum
 Hypocrisy is true of the politics of our time
 har ore khemebaazi he, har ore samvadaheenata kaa nasha
 The Left is happy to give a speech in their camp
 congress vaale kisi nae ko apana nahin paa rahe
 For the BJP, they are not those who do not belong to them
 agar hai to deshadrohi hai, dushman hai
 That is why nobody could be able to do it
 lapaknaa sabane chaha, lekin main kune main jaanboojhkar gira nahin
 Being Vajpayee is the left of this scope in politics
 vaajapeyi kaa janaa bhartiya raajnneeti se usee gunjaaish kaa nirvana he
 Political parties will now have to find Vajpayee inside them so that commitments remain and democracy too
 loktantr- sanghathan kaa bhi or desh kaa bhi

 In the Northeast India, where the BJP is playing its stanza, on the other side is the Congress, who is sitting hand in hand even knowing his mistakes and knowing
 haalanki is baar usamen ek ranneetik sudhaar jarur dekhne ko mila, jisamen vah meghalaya main sarkaar banane kii koshishen tej karti dikh rahi he
 Unlike Nagaland and Tripura, the Congress performed well in Meghalaya and on the basis of being the largest party in the state, sent Ahmed Patel and Kamal Nath there to keep the prospects of forming a government alive
 shaayad congress ko goa or manipur kaa sabak yaad rahaa, jab sabase badeepartihokar bhi vah sarkaar nahin bana saki thi
 The more burdensome task, but the question is that if the Congress had woken up earlier, it would not have happened
 jaraa sochie ek taraf dilli se dur rahakar 2 saalon se tripura main viplav or suneelabijepike liye mehnat kar rahe the

 Think, elections were being held in Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya, while the four mlcs of the party were joining JDU in Bihar
 aise main prabharee joshi kii udhedbun samajhi ja sakati he
 While BJP continues to win elections by targeting each state and its figure is reaching the BJP government in 21 states, the Congress is losing state by state and its government is left in only 4 states

 Former Ambassador of Pakistan to the US, Hussain Haqqani said, Kashmir is an emotional issue in Pakistan
 uske netaa apane logon ko yah bataane main asafal rahe hai ki pakistan ko is mudde par ab antarrashtriya samarthan hasil nahin he
 Haqqani, the current director of South and Central Asia at the Hudson Institute, said that Pakistan has been seeking international support for years to resolve the future dispute over Kashmir through talks with India and a referendum among the Kashmiri people 
 unhone kaha ki bharat is vivaad par tab tak baat bhi nahin karnaa chahta, jab tak pakistan pryojit aatankwaad samaapt nahin ho jaataa
 Haqqani wrote in an article on the website of the American think tank Hudson Institute, most Pakistanis do not know that the last resolution in the UN Security Council regarding Kashmir was passed in 1957 and if Pakistan talks about new voting in UN So he cannot garner support for the referendum in Kashmir today

 According to the letters received under the Right to Information Act, since 2004, three Union Sports Ministers had repeatedly warned Prime Minister Manmohan Singh against the structure of the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee and its chairman Suresh Kalmadi and the functioning of the committee
 purv khel mantri sunil dutt ne kaha tha ki aayojan samiti kii adhyakshata khel mantri jaise sarkaar dwaara namit kisi vyakti ke dwaara kii jaani chahie
 While Mani Shankar Iyer, who became the Sports Minister after him, criticized the committee for the wastage of money
 vahiin, emes gil ne kaha tha ki aayojan samiti kii kaaryakari samiti kii baithak shaayad hi kabhi hoti he or kendrikrut tareeke se liye gaye bade faisle ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 The letters written by these sports ministers have been made public on the information sought by SC Aggarwal through RTI
 varsh 2004 main jab aayojan samiti kii sanrachana ko antim rup diya ja rahaa tha, tab tatkaaleen khel mantri sunil dutt ne pradhanmantri ko patr likh kar kaha tha ki vah aayojan samiti ke adhyaksh ke pad par kalmadi kii niyukti ke bare main bhartiya olympic sangh ke prastaav se aashcharyachakit hai
 Dutt said this was different from the decision of the Group of Ministers
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki bhartiya olympic sangh ko yah jaankaree thi ki mantri samooh khelon kii taiyaari or aayojan ke liye khel mantri ko aayojan samiti kaa adhyaksh niyukt karne kii baat par sahamat he
 Dutt had alleged that the details released by the Cabinet Secretariat about the Group of Ministers meeting do not reflect the decisions taken during the meeting on various aspects of the composition of the organizing committee
 patr par yah tippanee likhi gai thi ki pradhanmantri ne dekh liya he or iske baad pradhanmantri ne dutt ko pavati bheji thi
 In his letters to the Prime Minister, Iyer, who became the Sports Minister after Dutt, underlined that the organizing committee was wasting money by appointing consultants at the rate of $ 5,000 per day and the Commonwealth Games Federation Chief Executive Officer Mike Hooper a farm house worth Rs 2 crore and a first class monthly air ticket were provided
 ayyar ne is baat kaa vishesh zikr kiya tha ki 1982 ke asian khelon kii vishesh aayojan samiti ke ulat maujuuda aayojan samiti ji

 hujuri karne vaali kuch mahilaon se bhari hui he, jabaki 1982 kii samiti main rajeev gandhi jaise shashakt janavaadee pratinidhi shaamil the
 He said that the chairman of the organizing committee had dictatorial powers as there was no person who could push for an alternative
 ayyar ne yahaan tak suzav diya tha ki aayojan samiti ke adhyaksh suresh kalmadi ko bazaar se dhan jutanaa chahie yaa kisi rajya mantri ko aayojan samiti kaa adhyaksh niyukt kiya janaa chahie, jinke paas kaaryakari board main paryaapt sankhya main sarkaar kii ore se namit log or saansad ho jinke paas unke faisle ko vito karne kii shakti ho
 The then Sports Minister said in another letter that the expenditure on organizing the Commonwealth Games has reached Rs 20,000 crore
