 unhone likhaa, ‘har koi bhartiya team kaa bahut sammaan karata he
 There is no doubt that there are great batsmen in it
 tendulkar or sahvaag kisi bhi akraman kii dhajjiyaan uda sakate hai
 But they cannot win the World Cup for India alone

 Uttar Pradesh Sampark Kranti Express is going to reach Delhi for the first time to the farmers and Dalit laborers of small holdings of Bundelkhand
 paanch saal main stesan puri tarah badal chukaa he
 The gangman, who takes the token of the train coming to light the torch in the darkness, is now standing comfortably, as the station is illuminated by the lights of the generator
 plateform kii oonchai bad chuki he or rigerveshan kii suvidha bhi milane lagi he
 The waitingroom is built at the station and the fans are moving
 aazaadee ke 60 saal baad tak jo nahin hua, vah kaam ranipur terricott ke liye mashhoor rahe kasbe main railway ne kiya he
 But when the election question was asked to 20-year-old Rajaram Kushwaha, who was slamming on the bench, his reply was, "congress has done nothing in 10 years
 modi ji ne gujarat kaa vikaas kiya he
 We need development
 ” mazdooree ke liye dilli ja rahe kushvaha ko jab is stesan par hue vikaas kii yaad dilaakar kureda, to uskaa hajir jawaab tha, “main to dilli ja rahaa hum, mujhe to vot daalana nahin he

 Saffron-colored Pawan Hans helicopter from the party is promoting political sadhvi
 uma ko bharosa he ki is baar bundelkhand main camel khilegaa
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP could not even open an account here
 party do siton par tisare or do siton par chauthe number par rahi thi
 In the last election, Congress won Jhansi, SP Jalaun and Banda and BSP in Hamirpur seat
 ‘vinaash purush’ kaa bhootuma jaanati hai ki chunauti kathin he isliye jhaansi ke bhaduya gaanv main pasinaa ponchhate hue unhone kaha, “aap samaajawaadee party ke gundon se mat darie

 i have been going to Charkhari three days a month
 ” uma lachchhedaar bhashaa main centre kii upie sarkaar or upi kii sapa sarkaar ko kos rahi hai
 But when he was asked that you too once called Narendra Modi a 'destroyer' and his development as a 'inflated balloon of media', did you lie at that time or has Narendra Modi changed now? Uma said, "I made this statement in 2007
 ab maine faisla kiya he ki is bayaan par koi bayaan nahin duungi
 "uma, who escapes from the past, is promoting by flying in the air, while Jain is keeping the road show as his weapon
 ve jahaan vot maangane jate hai, vahaan vah parchaa dena nahin bhoolatey jisamen unke vikaas kaaryon kaa byoraa he
 This includes the improvement of railway stations, the establishment of agricultural universities, the status of AIIMS status to Jhansi Medical College and roads made from their MP fund

 While Verma has been an MP three times, the Chaudhary family has held this seat continuously since 1984 (with the exception of 1977) since independence
 vijay choudhary lambey samay tak bispi main rahane ke baad congress main aae hai, aise main ve bispi kaa bada vot bank kaatane kaa dam bhar rahe hai
 To counter the Modi wave, he has coined a new slogan, "vote for the development you have seen

 That is why i am throwing strength in small gatherings in villages
 ” bispi kii kader style ke abhyast vijay ko apane rishtedaar or party ke varisht netaa brajalaal khabari se bhi kadi chunauti mil rahi he

 in samikarnon ke baavjood congress ke vivek singh or bijepi ke bhairon prasad mishra kii chunauti kamjor nahin he
 By the way, the biggest feature of this election is that all BJP candidates are contesting in the name of Modi and the rest of the candidates are contesting in their name
 modi ke dikhaae vikaas ke sapane logon ke jehan main aise chadhe hai ki ve vikaas ko tivi kii najar se dekh rahe hai
 The condition of Modi wave is like that people get to feel the winter with weather news rather than on the road

 taaja bayaan purv kendriya mantri aurcongresanetashashi tharurka aayaa he
 During a program, he said that no Hindu would want that the structure of the mosque be demolished and built into a Ram temple
 tharur ke is bayaan par jab bavaal machaa to unhone safai bhi jari kii
 In fact, he made this statement at the ongoing Hindu Literature Festival in Chennai on Sunday
 tharur ke is bayaan par subramanyam swami ne palatwaar kiya he
 Shashi Tharoor tweeted that my statement was misrepresented
 maine sirf kaha tha, ''bahut se hindu isliye vahaan par mandir chaahate hai, kyonki vahaan par shriram kii janmabhumi he
 But a good Hindu would not want a temple to be built in a place where someone else's religious site was demolished
 unhone likhaa ki yah meraa vyaktigat bayaan tha, main apni party kaa pravaktaa nahin hum isliye mere bayaan ko party se naa joden
 '' i was asked for my personal opinion at a literary festival & gave it as such
 i am not a Spokesperson for my party & did not claim to be speaking for@incindia

 co / akejvdloqg— Shashi Tharoor (@shashitharoor)october 15, 2018kis bayaan par machaa tha hangaamaa?shashi tharur ne yahaan krishnagopal gandhi ke saath charchaa main kaha, ''koi bhi hindu ye nahin chahega ki kisi duusare dharm ke dhaanche ko giraakar usee sthaan par ram mandir banaaya jaae
 In the program, Tharoor spoke on many issues besides the Ram temple
 unhone yahaan metoo kaa samarthan bhi kiya or saamne aa rahe maamalon par karrwai kii baat kii
 "no Hindu would want a Ram temple built after demolishing another religion's place of worship
" " -@shashitharoor # lfldialogue2018— Lit for Life (@hindulitforlife)october 14, 2018shashi tharur ke is bayaan par ab subramanyam swami ne bhi palatwaar kiya he
 He said, "there is a charge sheet against him (tharoor), now what can we say on the statement of such a person, he is a lowly man
 ''gauratlab he ki beete dinon main ram mandir kaa mudda bhartiya raajnneeti ke centre main aayaa he
 On the one hand there is political rhetoric, on the other hand, the hearing in this case is going to start daily from October 29 in the Supreme Court
 congress ne jhaada pallamaamle par congress ke arpyen singh ne pallaa jhaadte hue kaha ki shashi tharur kaa bayaan dekha nahin he, lekin jo bhi unka bayaan he vah nijee he or nijee bayaan par hamen kuch nahin kahana he
 The opinion of the Congress party is that the matter is in the court, whatever the decision of the court will be acceptable
 bijepi ne kaha- hakeekat se dur hai tharurkendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki tajjub he shashi tharur is baat par yakeen karte hai ki sachche hindu ayodhya main ram mandir nahin chaahate
 This could be the faith of Tharoor or Rahul Gandhi
 isse pataa chalata he ki ve hakeekat se kitne dur hai or ve chunaavon ke dauraan hi hindu ban jate hai
 VHP will hand over memorandum to governors On the other hand, Alok Kumar, the CEO of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), said on Monday that to spread awareness and prepare public opinion for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, the council will submit a memorandum to the governor of every state of the country from this week and Parliament will put pressure on mps to enact legislation in Parliament
 vishwa hindu parishad ke karyaadhyaksh ne kaha ki ram mandir kaa chunaav se koi sambandh nahin he balki yah karodon hinduon kii aasthaa se judaa vishay he
 Ram Mandir should be constructed as soon as possible while removing all legal hurdles

 While the Bastar controversy remained in the headlines, the success of Rajnandgaon did not come to the media

 Rajnandgaon Superintendent of Police Sanjeev Shukla says, "five years ago many of our policemen and common people used to be victims of Naxalite violence, but now we have controlled the situation"
 aankadon par gaur karen to jahaan 2009 naksaliyon ne kul 41 nagarikon or police waalon ko maaraa vahiin 2013 or 2014 main keval ek vyakti hi naksali hinsa kaa shikaar hua

 Therefore, their names have been sent to the state government under the rehabilitation policy of the government
 naksavad se ladane main badi kamyaabi mili police ke jaagrukta abhiyaan se
 Shukla says, 'we put posters of Maoists like Gudsa Usendi aka Sukhdev in the villages and forests and told the people that the big Maoists are surrendering in Andhra Pradesh
 isse naksaliyon ke changul main fanse adivaasiyon ko waapas laane main kamyaabi mili'
 Apart from this, in the last three years, the police employed villagers for employment and building broken culverts, building dams and roads
 ek police adhikari ne kaha 'jab logon ne paas ke ek gaanv main sinchai ke liye baandh banavaave kii maang kii or iske liye dharna dena shuru kiya to hamane unhen protsaahit kiya taaki vikaas ke liye janata kaa dabaav bane or maovadi hamaari madad ko roak na saken'
 With these small steps, many dedicated cadres of Maoists are coming back into the mainstream
 ve ab police ke saath milakar naksaliyon ke khilaaf jang main madad kar rahe hai
 a police officer said, 'naxalites were so stunned by our success that they started sending the tribal cadre out here so that they could not surrender, but with the help of the outside cadre they could not stay for long and then they were given Rajnandgaon The local cadre of k had to be recalled, but for the last three years they have not been able to make any new recruitment from our district '
 lekin sarkaar ke saamne unhen basaane or ek sthai rojgaar dene kii kadi chunauti he
 Journalist Girjashankar says, "the government will have to clear what it is doing for the protection and rehabilitation of the Maoists, or else this success will prove to be a few days of moonlight

 a senior CBI official said, "the Shunglu Committee has pointed out some clear cases of irregularities and we have received instructions from the Prime Minister's Office to investigate them
" ''shungalu samiti kii paanch reportein to mul prasaaran, khel gaanv, shahar ke buniyadi dhaanche, khel aayojan sthalon tathaa aayojan samiti ko lekar hai or ek mukhya report khel aayojan or sanchaalan se sambandhit he
 The city infrastructure report puts the Delhi government in the dock
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne yah report dilli sarkaar ke jawaab ke liye grih mantralay ko bhej di
 The ministry has given the Delhi government a month's time to respond to these allegations
 mukhyamantri shila dikshit kahati hai, ''shungalu samiti ke nateezon ke jawaab main ham antim report bana rahe hai
 There will be an article-wise answer to each charge

 The committee has also found Kalmadi and his associates guilty in the allocation of contracts, saying that "there was tremendous centralization of power at the top and there was a conflict of interest between the officials of the organizing committee"
 ''sutron kaa kahana he ki ab kalmadi kii giraftaar ke baad kai or log saboot denge

 kuch log urvashi rotela ke saath meri tulana kar rahe hai jo galat he
 Our characters in the film are completely different
 main ek korporate girl kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi hum or urvashi supermodel bani hai
 Therefore it is wrong to compare between us
 ham donon ke kairactor bilkul alag hai
 The truth is that all the actors on the set were like one family
 het story 4 ke bare main ihana kahati hai, `yah film real life ghatana par aadhaarit he
 There is no love trend in the film
 isamen revange story he
 This is a thriller movie
 asli ghatana par aadhaarit kahani hone ke kaaran main is film main kaam karne ko raji hui
 Directed by Vishal Pandya, the film will be released on 9 March
 is film main gulshan grover or karan wahi bhi hai
 The film 'faces: a Modern Day Classic' is a murder mystery with a backdrop, Bollywood of the early 50s
 kahani 1952 main ek abhinetri taraana or uski choti bahan amaanat ke ird-gird gumti he
 Manisha Koirala plays the actress and Jackie Shroff as the filmmaker in the film
 divya datta kaa kirdaar he taraana yani manisha kii choti bahan kaa
 Gulshan Grover plays the heroine of a heroine
 rushita bhatta ne bhoomika nibhaai he, ek junior artist kii or arya babbar film main murder kii jaanch karne vaale adhikari
 When i met its director Rohit Kaushik before watching the film 'faces', he told that he has been associated with many actresses of the 40s and 50s and has done some work with them and the way those actresses at that time Inspired by the story of Rohit, Rohit has made this film
 film main silent cinema se bolte cinema kii or badhati filmon main abhinetriyon ko kis tarah kii takaliphen hoti thim, kis tarah ke relationships hote the yaa us daur main laalach, apni pojishan ko barqaraar rakhane kii koshish, yah sab film main dikhaaya gaya he
 The comments magar in sabake baavjood film kii kahani or screenple sust or kamazor he
 Although in this murder mystery, you will not be able to guess the cause of the murderer and the murder, but it is not enough to make the film fun
 main is film ko thode zyada number de rahaa hum kyonki nirdeshak rohit kowshik ne us daur ke drame or acting ko thik se dikhaane kii koshish kii he
 My rating for the film is 2 stars
 film 'chehre' dekhne se pehle jab main iske nirdeshak rohit kowshik se mila tha tab unhone bataaya tha ki vah 40-50 ke dashak kii kai abhinetriyon ke saath jude hai or unke saath kuch kaam bhi kiya he or jis tarah un abhinetriyon ne us daur kii kahani kaa zikr kiya he usee se prerit hokar rohit ne yah film banaai he
 Speaking of silent cinema in the film, what kind of hardships the actresses had to face in cinema and rising films, what kind of relationships were there or greed at that time, trying to maintain their position, all this is shown in the film
 tippaniyan But despite all this, the story and screenplay of the film is dull and weak
 haalanki is murder mistry main aap kaatil or katl kii vajah kaa andaja ant tak nahin laga paaenge magar film ko mjedaar banane ke liye yah kaaphi nahin he
 i am giving this film a little more number because director Rohit Kaushik has tried to show the drama and acting of that era properly
 film ke liye meri reating he, 2 star

 uttar pradesh ke sinchai mantri shivpal singh yadav ne pichley dinon dhamkee di ki agar dilli isi tarah se yamuna kaa sara pani sokhkar sirf mel-mutr hi uttar pradesh ke liye chhodeygi to dilli kii ganga water supplai band kar di jaaegi
 He has also said that Delhi will have to improve
 chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone kii vajah se yathasthiti banaae rakhane kii suvidhajanak majaburi kii vajah se dilli ke prashaasak bhale hi dhamkee ko nazarandaaj kar den, lekin chunaav ke baad is par amal hone kii ghadi main garmi ke dauraan dilli main gambhir jal sankat paidaa ho saktaa he
 Shivpal's threat is the voice of the helpless people who live in the settlements and cities of Uttar Pradesh, situated on the banks of the Yamuna
 ve is nadi main dilli se chode gaye mel-mutr or rasinic kachare ko bardaasht kar rahe hai
 Despite being a river of religious importance, people cannot drink its water, even take a bath in it
 yahi nahin, kai jagahon par maveshi bhi iskaa pani nahin pite
 After Delhi, Yamuna's condition in two big cities of Uttar Pradesh, Mathura and Agra, it is clear that there is complete injustice to the state
 (mathura main puranic gaughat ke paas bah rahaa nalaninsaphi kaa najaris ninsaphi kaa najaara dekhnaa he to agra main jal santhaan ke water treetment plant par chale jaaie
 Here, the water that Agra picks up and cleans for drinking is nothing but organic waste (mal-mool)
 yamuna treetment plant se koi 200 meter dur khisak gai he or choti-si nahar banaakar pani treetment plant kii talahati main aata he
 Polyethylene, sewage, waste and rot are the most important features of this water
 agra main aise do water treetment plant hai
 225 million liters of deli (MLD) of water is treated from the treatment plant of the city and 144 MLD of water from the treatment plant at Sikandra
 jal santhaan kii prabandh nideshak manju rani gupta bataati hai, ''dilli atyadhik organic pradooshan vaala pani uttar pradesh ke liye chhod rahi he
 In the Mat branch, 150 cusecs of Ganges water is definitely added to it, so that the quality of water is slightly better
 ” unka maananaa he ki okhla main kam se kam 100 kusek saaf pani yamuna main milaayaa jaae tabhi kuch haalat behatar hogi
 Despite this, he claims that the Jal Sansthan is supplying and cleaning the water
 lekin shahar kii asli hakeekat dekhni ho to di
 K
 joshi se miliye
 Joshi is a member of the committee set up by the Supreme Court to oversee Yamuna pollution in Agra and has been associated with the Yamuna movement for a long time
 joshi kehete hai, ''jal santhaan pani jarur saaf karata he lekin log ise kapade dhone or baaki kaam ke liye hi istemaal karte hai
 Most homes are boring and people are drinking and drinking boring water from RO
 ” unke mutabik shahar main rojaanaa 900 emeldi ground water, 160 emeldi jal santhaan kaa pani or 30 emeldi pani handpump se nikaala jaataa he
 Joshi claims, "if all the water in Delhi was not stopped, then only Yamuna could get so much water from Agra
 lekin agra vaale to boond-boond saaf pani ko taras rahe hai
 "(bad odor arises from Agra canal coming out of Okhla barrage) In Mathura, the disease is the root cause of Mathura
 is dharmanagari kii to kalpana hi yamuna ke bina nahin ho sakati kyonki mahabharat kii manyata ke mutabik bhagwaan krishna kii sari lilaayen yaheen hui hai
 In Mathura, just like Agra, only dirty water is flowing into the river
 haal yah he ki yahaan 19veen sadi ke rajasthani sthapaty style ke zyaadaatar ghat mitti ke neeche dab gaye hai kyonki saal bhar un tak pani hi nahin aata
 Sant Jayakrishna Das, leader of the Yamuna Bachao Andolan, says, "it is not just a question of the population of Mathura, crores of people come here for religious tourism in a year
 in logon ke liye yamuna kaa snaan karnaa dharmik reeti se anivaary he, lekin ye log yahaan se punya lene kii bajaae bimaariyaan lekar jate hai
 “yamuna Bachao Pad Yatra was started from Mathura to Delhi under the leadership of Krishnadas in April last year
 tab kendriya jal sansaadhan mantri ne dilli se mathura ke bich ek samaantar naala banane kii baat par rajamandi jaahir kii thi taaki yamuna main sidhe ganda pani na jaae
 But the question is, if there is no dirty water in the Yamuna, then it will dry up completely? In such a situation, what would be achieved from the parallel drain, on this question, the monastic scientist writes on the copy, "yes, then it will be clean then That the Yamuna in mathura-vrindavan has ended
 jab nadi sukhi dikhegi to apane aap sarkaar-shraddhalu or adaalatein jaagruk hongi
 The effect of the drying up of the river in Mathura is that the mythological ghats built in the nineteenth century Rajasthan style are completely submerged by silt
 mathura or vrundavan main alag-alag sanghathan in ghaaton ke punaruddhar main lage hai
 Out of sight, out of mind, in fact, after leaving Delhi's Okhla barrage, the river passes through the countryside far enough in Uttar Pradesh
 gramin is par pine ke pani ke liye ashrith nahin hai or nadi kii peti main unke kheton ko isse khaas nuksaan nahin he
 Every year during the rainy season, the area of the river is very fertile due to increasing water level
 philhal is ilaake main gehun or sarson kii fasal lahalha rahi he
 But in most places the river has collapsed into a dirty drain
 jin kisaanon kaa iske irdagird jameen he, vahi vahaan jate hai
 This river is a short distance from Yamuna Expressway and due to this neither is seen nor does it smell
 is tarah se uski durdasha bhi najar se ojhal ho jaati he
 Atta Gujran village is located along the bank of Yamuna in Greater Noida area of gautam Buddha Nagar
 gaanv ke doodh vyapaaree satpal nagar tat se kareeb do kilometre dur bahane vaali dhara kii ore ishaara karte hue kehete hai, ''jaanavar bhi uskaa pani nahin pite
 We all use ground water for our needs
 ” nadi ke naale main tabdeel hone se unhen dukh to hota he lekin isse unke kaarobaar par koi asar nahin padataa
 Near the Yamuna Bridge on the aligarh-gautam Buddha Nagar border, about 70 km from Delhi, a bad odor arises from the water, as from Okhla barrage
 pul ke neeche apane khet main kaam kar rahe 56 varshiya gajraj kehete hai, ''ab se 30 saal pehle yahaan pani itnaa saaf hua karata tha ki ham ise pite the
 But far from drinking, if someone takes a bath in it, then it seems that glue is stuck on its body
 ” ve yah bhi bataate hai ki nadi kii peti main bhi log tubewel lagaakar jameen ke andar se pani nikaalkar sinchai karte hai
 The priest of the Hanuman temple built near this bridge bathes 50-year-old Manmohan Giri with hand pumps
 ve bataate hai, ''subah main teen baje pani se uthne vaali durgandh se saans lenaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 It contains industrial waste in addition to sewage and urine
 ” aakhir kab tak yah aisi hi rahegi? ''jab tak ise saaf karne ke liye hajaar-do hajaar log jaan nahin denge tab tak dilli or lakhanu main sarkaron kii neend nahin khulegi
 After the water flows out of the Yamunotri into the Garbage River, the Yamuna remains clean in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh far before entering Delhi, in which the aquatic life remains alive, but it dies after entering Delhi
 pallaa gaanv ke raste dilli main pravesh karne vaali yah nadi wazirabad bairaj se lekar okhla bairaj tak kul 22 kilometre ke raste main sabase zyada pradooshit hoti he
 Uttar Pradesh gives 500 cusecs of Ganges to meet Delhi's water needs and Delhi does the same
 dilli main 3,300 million litre daily (emeldi) sivej yamuna main girane vaale naalon main bahata he
 a total of 16 sewage treatment plants (stps) have been set up for cleaning, with a maximum capacity of 2,330 MLD
 keval 70 fisadi kaam karne vaale in astipi kii badaulat dilli kaa keval 1,600 emeldi sivej saaf kiya ja rahaa he or takreeban itnaa hi sivej lekar yamuna uttar pradesh main phir daakhil hoti he
 Pollution control board is one of the main departments in Yamuna to take care of waste
 board ne apana kaam keval pani kii jaanch or chetavanee jari karne tak simit kar rakhaa he
 The board does not have any data on how chemical waste dumping industries in Yamuna were shut down forever and how much they reduced the pollution of Yamuna? "the Pollution Control Board, says Pankaj Baba, president of Yamuna Raksha Manch Not working properly yamuna main bad rahe pradooshan ko rokane ke jitani sakriyata gaiyr sarkari log dikhaa rahe hai sarkari vibhaag uskaa dasvaan hissaa bhi nahin kar rahe
 "yamuna Action Plan Dipped in Sewer The hope of getting new life for Yamuna, who is moaning from the burden of dirtyness, arose when the 'yamuna Action Plan' came into reality in the year 2000 with the help of Central and State Government
 kai charnon vaale is plan main siver-naalon kii gandagi or silt ko sidhe nadi main girane se rokane, astipi se naalon ke gande pani ko saaf kar pani kaa yamuna main chhodie or shahar main siver linon kaa jaal bichhaakar inhen naalon se jodgaye kii taiyaari kii gai

 se adhik kharch ho chuke hai lekin abhi tak yamuna main girane vaale sivej kii maatra or astipi kii shodhan kshamta ke bich dogune se adhik kaa faasla bana hua he
 Engineer Ravi Srivastava, who was involved in the initial phases of the Yamuna Action Plan, says, "delhi, Mathura and Agra have close to 40 percent areas that are still without sewer lines
" in ilaakon kaa mel-mutr naaliyon ke jariye naalon or phir yamuna main mil rahaa he
 "no rhetoric, no action, can Delhi's sewage be made worthy of drinking or disposal in Mathura and Agra?" Regional Pollution Officer of Agra b

 "the flowing water has the power to increase the amount of oxygen inside it," says Awasthi
 phir gharelu apshisht bhale hi kitna glani bharaa dikhe lekin yah rasinic kachare se kam khatarnaak hota he
 "technically, they are purifying the water of Yamuna, but in their office, they gave this reporter only water of Bisleri
 kuch aise hi swaagat karne ke liye mathura ke sant bhi majaboor hue
 Now the question is, when will Uttar Pradesh get 28 percent water from the freshwater barrage, which was promised in the 1994 agreement

 Let me tell you that there were reports of a dispute between Tea Series and Kangana Ranaut last year as Kangana Ranaut's stalled film 'I Love New York' had to be released without any promotion
 kangana ko is baat se shikaayat thi ki unase puche yaa unhen bataaye bina film ko release kiya ja rahaa he or kangana ke naam par 'ai lav neuyork' ko bechney kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 However, Kangana's thinking was wrong as the film is owned by its producer and he can release whenever he wants, yet Kangana was angry
 baad main kangana kaa naam film ke kisi kaam nahin aayaa or film 'ai lav neuyork' buree tarah flop ho gai
 Now once again, t Series and Kangana are going to make a film together
 lagata he puraani galatchhemiyaan dur ho chuki hai

 a journalist enters the chamber of a senior officer of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and is asked, 'how did you know that the ED has raided the Bhujbal case
 aapako kisne bataaya?' jaahir he, yah chaunkaane vaali baat he
 But the journalist questions about the bogus companies that are being investigated in the scandalous scam
 jawaab nahin aata, ek or sawaal aata he, 'kya aapane bhujabal ke khilaaf file kii gai ECIR padhi he? agar haa to vah kisne aapako di?'idi ECIR ko ek gopneey dastavej maanata he jise maamle kii jaanch puri hone se pehle kisi se nahin saajha kiya ja saktaa
 The ed's Mumbai unit is preparing to take action against a junior employee
 is adhikari ne kathith rup se bhujabal maamle main 4-5 sandigdh logon ke naam or profile media main li kiye
 However, it is still unknown what action the ED is going to take
 bain ke liye rahen taiyaar: edeka akhbaar ne idi ke sutron ke hawaale se khabar chhaapi thi ki jin logon ko maamle main saman kiya he, unamem hawala oparator anil bastawade kaa bhi naam he
 According to the allegations, Anil is suspected to have helped Bhujbal send money to Indonesia
 idi maanata heki yah jaankaree media ko li nahin kii jaani thi
 a senior ED official said, “the central government has framed a media policy, which everyone has to follow
 chaahe vah hamaare karmchaaree hon yaa mediakarmi
 If they do not follow, they will have to be prepared for a ban from our side
 'unhone aage kaha, 'bhujabal maamle main bhi rojaanaa ke apadet ko follow karne kii jarurat nahin he
 However, we have created such a system that the ed's special director officially confirms the information
 lekin junior adhikariyon se suchanaaen hasil karnaa puri tarah galat he
 In the ed's Mumbai unit, call records of junior officers who are suspected of leaking information to the media are being extracted
 ek sandesh ke jawaab main likhaa mujhe is baat kii garv he or main is baat ko lekar khud ko sammanit mahasoos karata hum ki mujhe madhyapradesh kii seva karne kaa mauka mila
 My life is dedicated to serving the people of Madhya Pradesh
 main uske janadesh kaa sammaan karata hum
 The central government will soon introduce a new system in government schools
 iske tahat bachche class main jo padhenge, uski reating denge
 Children in class 5 and above will be able to give this rating
 sarkaar kii yojana he ki is nae niyam ko isi saal se lagu kar diya jaae
 UP board: 10th, 12th paper will start from March 16, a government official said, 'we want children to tell how they are being taught
 ham ek aisa system develop karenge jahaan bacchon se kuch sawaal puche jaaenge or unke jawaab main ve jo kahenge vahi teachers kaa feedback hoga
 'B
 Ed ke liye neshnal entrens-agsit test laa sakati he sarkarsarkaar ne is babat kai rajyon se baat bhi kar lee he or ve is nai vyavastha ko lagu karne par raji ho gaye hai
 Model question paper is being prepared for this

 But now parents are more inclined towards private schools, saying that the level of education in government schools is not as good as in private schools
 aatank kaa aakaa masood ajahar ab nahin batch paaegaa
 The news is coming that Pakistan has made up its mind to take action against Masood Azhar
 khabar ye bhi he ki pakistan yuan main masood ajahar ko bain kiye jane ke prastaav kaa virodh bhi nahin karegaa
 After this, questions are arising whether Pakistan wants to get rid of Masood Azhar? Has Masood become a burden for him? It is no longer possible for Masood Azhar to take responsibility for the Pulwama attack
 aisi khabaren tej ho gai hai ki pakistan masood ajahar ko or bachaane kii koshish nahin karegaa
 It is reported that Pakistan may withdraw its opposition on the UN Security Council if it proposes to declare Masood as a global terrorist
 agar aisa hua to masood ajahar kaa jeena muhaal ho jayega
 He will have to go behind bars
 wo pakistan main khuleam nahin gum sakegaa
 All the accounts of his organization will be sealed
 uske sanghathan ko hone vaali funding band ho jaaegi
 Not only this, the threat to his life will increase manifold than before
 iske saath hi pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne bhi palati maari he
 Until yesterday, Qureshi, who had given Masood a clue in Pulwama attack, has now said that he will look into the dossier given by India
 haalanki ise aatankiyon ke khilaaf air strike se ghabaraae hue pakistan kii chaal bhi mana ja rahaa he
 At the same time, it is being considered as a strategy to cut the time, the strategy adopted by Pakistan after 26 / 11 Mumbai attack
 ISI pakistan main pal rahe aatankiyon kaa istemaal bharat par hamale karwaane ke liye karti he
 In such a situation, any action against them can be termed as show off
 pakistan ko masood ajahar kii salaamati kii itani chintaa he ki uske mantri uske maare jane kii khabaron kaa khandan karne main der nahin karte
 However, another effect of the siege of Pakistan is being seen on the international stage along with the action of the Indian Air Force after the Pulwama attack
 somvaar ko pakistan ne ek kanoon paarit kiya jiske tahat un aatankiyon or unke sanghathanon ke khilaaf yuan ke pratibandhon ko lagu kiya jayega
 Pakistan has to take this step due to pressure from the global community to tighten the terrorists on their land
 iske saath hi ise pakistan sarkaar ke ek bade sutara ne daawa kiya he ki pakistan sarkaar ne jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana masood ajahar samet aatanki sanghathanon par kadi karrwai kaa faisla kiya he
 According to the Pakistani official, these steps are being taken to reduce the increased tension with India
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ye kadam kisi bhi vakt uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav turned 77 on Tuesday
 kuch vakt pehle apane kunbe kii kalah se jujhane vaale mulaayam ne apane raajnneetik kariyar main tamaam utaar-chadhaav dekhe hai
 This month, his party has completed 25 years
 samaajawaadee party kaa safarnamachar oktober, 1992 ko lakhanu ke begum hazrat mahal park main mulaayam singh yadav nesamajawaadee partibanane kii ghoshnaa kii
 Mulayam, who learned politics in the shadow of socialist ideology leaders like Ram Manohar Lohia and Raj Narayan, had already become the CM of Uttar Pradesh before the formation of SP
 lekin inaki apane logon dwaara khadi kii gai apni koi party nahin thi
 In the late 1980s, he became the President of the Lok Dal in Uttar Pradesh, which later became part of the Janata Dal
 samaajawaadee party kii kahanemulaayam singh ke siyaasi safarke saath-saath chalati rahi
 Mulayam became the CM of Uttar Pradesh for the first time in 1989
 november 1990 main centre main veepi singh kii sarkaar gir gai to mulaayam singh chandrashekhar kii janata dal (samaajawaadee) main shaamil ho gaye
 And with the support of Congress, he sat on the chair of CM
 april 1991 main congress ne samarthan waapas le liya to mulaayam singh kii sarkaar gir gai
 In 1991, there were mid-term elections in UP in which Mulayam Singh's party lost and BJP came to power in the state
 agle saal yani 1992 main mulaayam singh yadav ne jab apniparty khadi kito unke paas bada janaadhar nahin tha
 Assembly elections were to be held in UP in November 1993
 sapa mukhiya ne bijepi ko dobaaraa satta main aane se rokane ke liye bahujan samaaj party se gathjod kar liya
 This was the first major experiment of the Samajwadi Party
 babari masjid vidhwans ke baad paidaa hue siyaasi maahaul main mulaayam kaa yah prayog safal bhi rahaa
 Mulayam Singh again came to power with the support of Congress and Janata Dal and became CM
 us vakt alag uttarakhand kii maang jor pakadaney lagi thi
 On 2 October 1994, people were demanding a separate Uttarakhand firing in Muzaffarnagar
 is ghatana ko rampur tirahaa golibari cond ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It was alleged that on the instructions of the then CM Mulayam Singh, the policemen opened fire, killing 6 people
 2 june 1995 ko lakhanu main hue state guest house cond main mayawati se saath hue durvyavhaar kii vajah se mulaayam agle din hi satta se bedakhal ho gaye
 The credit of the Samajwadi Party was also greatly discounted
 soobe kii raajnneeti se baahar hone ke baad ab mulaayam kii najar centre kii raajnneeti par thi
 Mulayam felt that now Samajwadi Party has to be recognized at the national level
 mulaayam 1996 main mainpuri seat se loksabhaa kaa chunaav lade or jite bhi
 The United Front government was formed at the center and SP was part of this alliance
 sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh kaa naam pradhanmantri ke liye tay hote-hote rah gaya
 Mulayam became the Minister of Defense in the Deve Gowda government
 gujral sarkaar main bhi wo isi pad par rahe
 However, in 1998 this government fell and the country held general elections again
 lekin mulaayam ko pataa tha ki samaajawaadee party kaa vajood upi main uski jeet main kaayam rahegaa
 Therefore, he started building the organization again in the state and the Samajwadi Party was destined to win the 2003 assembly elections
 29 agast 2003 ko mulaayam singh yadav ne soobe ke mukhyamantri ke taur par phir se shapath lee
 The Samajwadi Party government was in the state for four years
 vaise 2004 kaa loksabhaa chunaav bhi samaajawaadee party ke liye aitihaasik rahaa
 The party won 35 seats
 lekin dilli kii satta main hissedari nahin mil pai
 The five years that followed were extremely turbulent for the Samajwadi Party
 ek ore rashtriya raajnneeti kii lalak, duusari ore kshetreey kshatrap bane rahane kii laalasaa
 The party began to be divided in this dilemma
 kaaryakarta bhi belgaum hone lage the
 The Samajwadi Party won just 22 seats in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 mulaayam ne iske baad bada faisla liya
 In the state assembly, the leader placed the younger brother Shivpal Yadav on the chair of the opposition and himself took command of the politics of Delhi
 is daur main party ke bade musalmaan cheharaa ajam khan ne sapa chhod di
 Leaders like Rajabbar and Beni Prasad Verma also left the Samajwadi Party and Amar Singh's dominance in the party increased
 babari vidhwans cond ke aropiyon main se ek kalyaan singh ko samaajawaadee party main shaamil kiya gaya jo bijepi main upekshit mahasoos kar rahe the
 With Kalyan Singh joining the Samajwadi Party, many of Mulayam's colleagues left the party, who walked in step by step in the political journey of Netaji
 janeshwar mishra, ramsharan das or lakshmikant verma jaise diggaj samaajawaadee netaaon kaa nidhan hua
 The aggressive methods of the Bahujan Samaj Party, which came to power with a strong majority in the 2007 assembly elections, played an important role in weakening the Samajwadi Party
 lekin paanch saal satta main dur rahe mulaayam singh itani jaldi haar nahin maanane vaale the
 Before the 2012 elections, Netaji handed over the command of Uttar Pradesh SP to his son Akhilesh Yadav
 farvari 2010 main amar singh bhi party se baahar kar die gaye the
 When Azam returned home, sp's chase left Kalyan
 akhilesh ne chunaav se pehle khub mehnat kii
 What Akhilesh, the whole socialist community got out on the streets to fulfill Netaji's dreams
 iskaa nateeja bhi dikhaa jab 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ke paksh main apratyaashit nattejey aae
 Akhilesh became the CM of the state and the second generation knocked in the Samajwadi Party
 dhire-dhire party main yadav parivaar ke sadasyon kii taadaad bhi badhati gai
 Today, 20 members of this family are part of the Samajwadi Party
 samaajawaadee party kaa yah daur pehle ke daur kii tulana main bilkul alag he
 The way Akhilesh works is completely different from Netaji
 chaar-saadhe chaar saal tak party or sarkaar ke bheetar sabakuch thik-thaak chalaa lekin agle vidhansabha kii aahat milte hi desh ke sabase bade siyaasi gharaane main kalah shuru ho gai
 Amar Singh, who was away from the party for six years, returned home
 unhen mahasachiv banaaya gaya or rajyasabha bheja gaya
 Beni Prasad Verma also returned home and was sent to Rajya Sabha
 chachaa shivpal or amar singh ke samarthan se bahubali mukhtaar ansaari kii party ke samaajawaadee party main ho rahe vilay kaa akhilesh ne virodh kiya
 But Akhilesh did not do before Netaji
 phir siem akhilesh ne bhrashtachar ke aaropee kuch mantriyon ko apni cabinet se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Akhilesh also discharged uncle Shivpal Yadav, who holds key portfolios in his cabinet
 mulaayam singh ne balance karne kii koshish main pradesh adhyaksh kaa pad bete se chhinakar bhai ko saunp diya
 However, Shivpal returned to the cabinet later and this phase of infighting calmed
 lekin akhilesh ko pradesh adhyaksh kaa pad waapas nahin mil paaya
 Akhilesh then discharged some ministers, including uncle Shivpal, from his cabinet
 kalah kaa ek or daur yadav parivaar main shuru hua
 Mulayam's cousin and Rajya Sabha member Ram Gopal Yadav was expelled from the party
 akhilesh ke kuch or karibiyon kii bhi party se chuttee kar di gai
 But this time Akhilesh did not bow down
 lakh koshishon ke baad bhi chachaa shivpal kii sarkaar main waapas nahin ho saki he
 During the fresh discord, many times it seemed that the party would break
 lekin netaji ne sabakuch sambhaal liya he
 Now that Akhilesh has started preparing for the next election, Shivpal has been given the responsibility of bringing Shivpal along with other parties for the proposed pre-election grand alliance
 aise main 2017 kaa vidhansabha chunaav samaajawaadee party ke itihaas main nai ibaarat likhane ja rahaa he
 Last year the Indian hockey team did not get a place in the Champions Trophy but now the International Hockey Federation (FIH) has given it a place for this year by increasing the number of participating countries

 The new year has started
 is saal jo students apane 20wein saal main kadam rakhane vaale hai
 Know that this age is very important for career and life
 is umr main liya gaya aapako koi bhi mahatvapurn faisla aapke puri jivan ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 This is an age when it is very important for you to be serious about your career
 jaaniye is umr main kaise karen kariyar ke faisle:1
 At this age, first of all give yourself some time and think what you want to do in life
 khadoos bos ko karnaa he khush, to apanaaen ye 7 tareeke2
 Work towards getting yourself specialized in the field in which you want to work
 har haal main ye target lekar chalem ki 25 saal ke hote hi aapke haathon main safalataa ho
 If you adopt these tips, you will feel like in office, there will be no workload! 3
 ye umr bahut hi chanchal hoti he jisamen apane lakshya se bhatakane ke chance zyada rahete hai
 So learn to recognize friends around you
 apane group se un logon ko nikaal den jo aapaki padhai yaa kariyar main baadha ban rahe hon
 4
 profeshnal bananaa is umr se sikh lenaa chahie
 If work is done in this direction from now, there will be no problem in working in the office
 har intervyuu main puche jate hai ye 7 ahm sawaal, is tarah den jawaab5
 There is a lot of confusion about career at this age
 aapako bahut sari chijen ek saath acchhee lag sakati he
 Many people can tell you that it will be good for you
 apni kshamta or apni mehnat ko dekhte hue hi kariyar kaa chayan karen
 Initially everything goes well, but suddenly one day it leaves you and goes away
 chhodkar jane vaala to chalaa jaataa he lekin peeche se aap pachhataati hi rah jaati hai
 Many times, it is thought that why should this relationship be taken so far
 
 
 ? kyon us par yakeen kiya
 
 
 After that only remorse remains
 lekin sachai yahi he ki agar aapke saath dhokhaa hua he to kahin na kahin uske liye aap bhi jimmedaar hai
 If you had gone through some things in time, it would not have come like this
 ye hai wo baaten jin par aapane agar pehle hi gaur kiya hota to sthiti kuch or hoti
 1
 kya wo aksar aapako milane ke liye bulaayaa karata tha? kya wo jagah aisi hua karti thi jahaan jane main aap sahaj nahin ho paati thim? kya wo aapse kuch aisi baaten bhi kiya karata tha jinhen sunanaa aapako pasand nahin hota tha?2
 Did he not happen to you despite you? Did he focus only on the girls passing by? 3
 kya wo aapako jo bhi gift detaa tha uske badale aapse bhi gift kii ummid karata tha? yaa wo aapako paison kii dhauns dikhaaya karata tha?4
 Did he see you in a way that made you blush? 5
 kya galati hone ke baavjood wo aapse maafee nahin maangata tha aurapako hi sori bolne ke liye majaboorkarta tha?agar aapke saath bhi aisa kuch hua tha to iskaa sidhaa sa matlab he ki use aapse kabhi pyaar tha hi nahin
 In such a situation, it is good to forget all the old things and move forward

 Rahul Gandhi has also taken care of the caste equations with new and young faces from UP in his team
 bihar, bengal, telugana, goa or andhra pradesh jaise ahm rajya ke netaaon ko tavajjo nahin di gai he
 While these states have a total of 121 Lok Sabha seats
 in rajyon ko nazarandaaj karne ke peeche sabase badi vajah ye maani ja rahi he ki party ke paas koi kaddavar or rashtriya str kaa netaa nahin he
 Not only this, the condition of the party in these states is also not very good
 andhra pradesh ke bantane or chaar saal pehle satta ganvaane ke baad se congress kaa janaadhar lagaataar khisakta gaya he
 However, former Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy has made a comeback in the Congress recently
 aisa hi haal telugana kaa bhi he,pashchim bengal main congress lagaataar kamjor ho rahi he
 The Congress has lost its support in the state by-elections and panchayat elections

 Special importance has been given to UP
 pradesh ke 5 sadasyon ko seedblusi main jagah di gai he, jo kisi ek pradesh se sabase zyada hai
 The status of UP increases even more that national president Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi themselves also win elections from UP itself

 Farmers allege that till now Lekhpal or any other officer has not reached the village for the survey

 According to the farmers, 70 percent of their crop has been destroyed

 The farmers of Jayapur now look forward to help from their MP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 ' uttarakhand main mishan clin sweep kaa sapana dekh rahi bijepi ne sabhi paanchon siton ke liye candidet ke naam kaa elaan kar diya he
 For the 100 percent result in the state, BJP has cut the ticket of two former chief ministers, and has fielded two new faces
 ye nae chehre hai vartmaan pradesh adhyaksh ajay bhatta or tirath singh ravat
 Tirath Singh Rawat has previously headed the state unit
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne shandaar pradarshan karte hue rajya kii sabhi paanchon siton par kabja kiya tha
 The challenge before the BJP now is to repeat its previous performance in these five seats in 2019 as well
 rajya ke siyaasi mizaaj ko bhaanpate hue bijepi ne 2 diggajon kaa kaat diya he
 Both these veterans have been former Chief Ministers of Uttarakhand
 inke naam hai bhuwan chandra khanduri or bhagat singh koshyari
 In its list, BJP has replaced Ajay Bhatt from Bhagat Singh Koshyari from Nainital seat, while Tirath Singh Rawat has been replaced in place of former Chief Minister Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri from Pauri Garhwal
 teen duusari siton par bijepi ne apane puraane diggajon, tehri se maala rajyalakshmi shah, almoda se ajay tamta or haridwar se ramesh pokharial nishank, par hi bharosa jataayaa he
 The new faces were announced in place of the two former chief ministers, Koshiyari and Khanduri, as they conveyed their desire to the party high command not to contest this time
 iske alaava donon netaa bijepi main tikat paane kaa aghoshit umr kaa paimaana paar kar chuke the
 Bhagat Singh Koshyari, born in 1942, has completed 76 years
 jabaki bhuwan chandra khanduri 84 saal ke ho chuke hai
 It is believed that BC Khanduri was seeking a ticket for his son from this seat, but the BJP leadership refused
 iske baad bisi khanduri ke bete manish khanduri pichley saptaah rahul gandhi kii maujuudagi main congress main shaamil ho gaye the
 In this regard, when State President Ajay Bhatt was asked, he said that Manish Khanduri is not a member of BJP, so he is free to join any party
 bisi khanduri ne bhi apane bete ke bare main kaha tha ki manish khanduri yuva hai or vah apane faisle lene ko swatantra hai
 Now the challenge before the new faces of BJP is to retain the tilism of popularity of its predecessor leaders
 paudi gadhwal seat se manish khanduri ko tikat milanaa lagbhag tay he
 If this happens, the contest in this seat will be Tirath Singh Rawat vs Manish Khanduri
 bataa den ki tirath singh ravat kabhi bisi khanduri ke vafaadaaron main shaamil rahe hai
 At the same time, the challenge before Ajay Bhatt, who has proved his ability in the assembly elections, is to prove his electoral skills once again
 do saal pehle vidhansabha chunaavon main bhatta ke netritv main party ne 70 main se 57 siton par aitihaasik vijay hasil kii thi
 Although Ajay Bhatt himself lost his seat from Ranikhet constituency in Almora, now being given a party ticket for the Lok Sabha elections is considered an award for him
 shanivaar se siem sanbhaalenge prachaar kii kamanauttarakhand main tikaton kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi bijepi ne prachaar kaa tabadatod prachaar abhiyaan plan taiyaar kar liya he
 CM Trivendra Singh Rawat himself is the star campaigner of the state
 uttarakhand main pehle charan main 11 april ko matdaan he
 CM will hold rallies in Nainital on 23 March, Almora, Garhwal and Haridwar on 24 March
 uttarakhand bijepi kaa daawa he ki centre or rajya donon jagah bijepi kii sarkaar hone kii vajah se rajya main dabl speed se kaam kiya he, lihaaja janata kaam ke is speed ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye party ko ek or mauka degi

 rape peedita ke chachaa dwaara kii taraf se darj karai gai exiaar main rape ke aaropee bijepi vidhayak kuldeep senger ko haadase ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya gaya tha
 a close examination of the names of the accused in the FIR has revealed that another BJP leader is an accused in the accident
 peedita ke chachaa kii taraf se darj karaae gaye exiaar main 'aaropee number-7' arun singh he jo bijepi kaaryakarta he or unnav main ek blockka adhyaksh he
 Arun Singh is also close to the accused BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke prachaar ke dauraan arun singh ko bijepi pramukh amit shah or unnav se bijepi saansad sakshi maharaj jaise sheersh netaaon ke saath photo or video main dekha ja saktaa he
 Arun Singh is the son-in-law of UP minister Ranvendra Pratap Singh aka 'dhunni Bhaiya'
 ranvendra pratap singh upi kii yogi adityanath sarkaar main krishi rajya mantri or krishi shiksha evam shodh mantri hai
 Ranvendra Singh is a BJP MLA from a seat in Fatehpur district
 bataa den ki yah vahi jagah he jahaan ke trek maalik or driver hai
 So far, however, there is no evidence of Singh's association with either
 sibiai kii exiaar main bhi is baat kii zikr he ki arun singh or kuch or log rape peedit parivaar ko dhamka rahe the ki vah cese waapas le le
 Meanwhile, Ranvendra Singh said, 'the CBI is investigating the case
 jaanch main sab kuch spasht ho jayega
 He is my relative no doubt, but it is not a crime
 peedita kaa aarope he ki kuldeep singh senger or uske sahaayakon ne varsh 2017 main uske saath rape kiya tha, jab vah unke paas naukari maangane gai thi
 She made her allegations public in April 2018, when she threatened that if the police did not register her case, she would commit suicide outside Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's residence in Lucknow
 teen hi maheene beete hai, jab supreme court se ritair hote vakt chif justise aaram lodha ne kaha tha, ab kuch maheene khud ko vakt duungaa, lekin ab justise lodha phir se kaam par hai, kyonki supreme court ne unhen ek badi jimmedaari di he - bisisiai ko nae sire se khadaa karne, ipel main chennai superkings or rajasthan royles tiimon ke alaava raaj kundra or gurunath mayppan kaa bhavishya tay karne kii
 At the same time, the future of n Srinivasan is also related to Justice Lodha's report
 supreme court main chif justise rahete hue justise lodha ne kai ahm faisle sunaae
 He was also seen hitting the government directly on the issue of the collegium
 unhone saarvajanik manch par yahaan tak kah diya tha ki agar nyaaypalika ke kaam main hastkshep hua, to vah pehle vyakti honge, jo apni kursi chhod denge
 But now the time has changed
 haal hi main dakshin dilli ke swami nagar main rah rahe justise lodha se mulaakaat hui
 The same warmth was seen
 unhone bade pyaar se chaay bhi pilaai or tamaam baaten bhi kin, jinamein dilli chunaav ko lekar charchaa bhi shaamil he
 He also spoke on the Supreme Court Collegium, but he does not want to speak openly in this matter
 haalanki unhone england kaa zikr jarur kiya or bataaya ki kis tarah vahaan jaj kii niyukti ke liye puraa panel kaam karata he, isliye unhen lagata he ki aise main jajon kii niyukti main paardarshita barti ja sakati he
 According to Justice Lodha, the work is done in the High Court as well, but there is more pressure on the Supreme Court judge, because there is a Supreme Court to fix the order of the High Court, but the order of the Supreme Court is the last order
 justise lodha ne nyaaypalika main apane 21 saal ke safar ko yaad karte hue kai puraane kisse bhi sunaae
 Then said that a few days ago he got an invitation to chair a panel in the BCCI and IPL fixing case, for which he agreed
 haalanki vah jaanate hai ki yah kaam chunauti bharaa he, lekin justise lodha ne kaha ki vah chaahate hai ki chah maah main kaam puraa kar len
 But the most difficult of these is the suggestion to improve BCCI
 unhone kaha ki sabase pehle unhone is panel ke do anya jajon justise ashok bhaan or justise aarvi rabindran se baat kii
 He then held a meeting and decided how to proceed in the investigation of the case
 ab farvari ke pehle hafte main duusari meeting kii jaaegi
 According to Justice Lodha, only the work of reading the full judgment of the Supreme Court is going on
 haalanki unhone ummid bhi jataai ki chah maheene main apana kaam puraa karne kii koshish karenge
 Regarding the media, Justice Lodha says that he too gets shocked by watching Hindi channels many times when there is a news that the Supreme Court reprimanded him

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani gave a clear indication that his party is in favor of bringing the Prime Minister under the purview of Lokpal Bill
 unhone kaha ki rajg sarkaar dwaara 1998 or 2001 main taiyaar vidheyak main iskaa saaf ullekh kiya gaya tha
 In his latest blog, he said that he has been in favor of bringing the Prime Minister under the ambit of Lokpal Bill since the beginning
 is sambandh main unhone 1988 main rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par us asahmati note par kiye apane hastakshar kaa zikr kiya, jisamen anya kai pramukh saansadon ne rajeev gandhi sarkaar kii ore se taiyaar lokapal vidheyak ke masaude par asantosh jataayaa tha
 In that dissent note it was said, "while studying the working of the Lokayuktas of the states, we found that in many states, the Chief Minister also comes under the purview of the Lokayukta
 hamaara purajor maananaa he ki isi tarah pradhanmantri pad ko bhi lokapal ke daayre main aana chahie
 "it is noteworthy that including the all-party meeting on Sunday on the Lokpal Bill, the BJP has been avoiding opening its cards in this regard
" ravivaar kii baithak ke baad bhi pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke bare main puche jane par vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne kaha tha ki bhaajapa is vidheyak par sansad kii sthaayee samiti main charchaa ke dauraan apane vichaar rakhegi
 Advani wrote on his blog that even in the Lokpal draft bills of 1989 and 1996, the Prime Minister was placed under the ambit of Lokpal
 unhone kaha, ‘‘baad main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali rajg sarkaar ke dauraan pesh kiye gayi lokapal vidheyakon main bhi pradhanmantri ko daayre main rakhaa gaya tha
 i remember well that as Prime Minister Atalji was very firm on the fact that the post of Prime Minister should not be outside the jurisdiction of Lokpal
 ’’rajg ne varsh 1998 or phir 2001 main lokapal ke vidheyak sansad main pesh kiye the
 Both Bills contained provisions for placing the Prime Minister's post under the purview of Lokpal
 adwani ne ravivaar ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh dwaara lokapal ke mudde par bulaayi gayi sarvadaleey baithak kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki yah baithak anokhi thi or aisa pehle kabhi nahin dekha gaya ki raajnneetik dalon ne is mudde par gaur karne ke sarkaar ke tareeke kii ekamat se aalochana kii
 He said that along with the leaders of almost all the parties present in the meeting, he supported the views of Sushma Swaraj, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, that the way the government is dealing with this issue and the way the Parliament has been neglected, it has absolutely no support
 can not be done
 adwani ne kaha, ‘‘
 
 maine kai sarvadaleey baithkon main bhaag liya he
 However, the meeting called by the Prime Minister on the evening of July 3 proved to be unique, with no prior example showing
 pichley ravivaar kii baithak se pehle aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua ki kisi sarvadaleey baithak main sarkaar kii aalochana ko lekar itani ekarey ho
 Referring to the views expressed by Sushma in the meeting, Advani said that by keeping the established parliamentary procedures unilateral, the government further complicated the issue and did its own laughing job
 yah sarvadaleey baithak is gadabadi se khud ko baahar nikaalane kii sarkaar kii ek koshish prathit hoti he
 Advani also mentioned in his blog the views expressed in the all-party meeting of Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley
 jetali ne kaha tha ki sanyukt samiti main shaamil centre ke mantriyon dwaara taiyaar masaude par vistrut tareeke se gaur karne kii jarurat he kyonki is masaude main lokapal ko aasaani se sarkaar ke prabhaav main aa jane laayak banane kii koshish kii gayi he

 The Union Home Ministry has authorized 10 security and intelligence agencies to intercept, monitor and decipher the information prepared, sent or received in any computer source and intercepted
 aalochakon ne aagaah kiya ki yah adhisuchana bhayaavah he or iskaa nirankush dhang se istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 He also said that the use of the word 'any' in it gives these agencies almost unlimited rights to get information about people
 masalan, diggaj maanavadhikaar vakil indira jaisingh ne is adhisuchana ko 'supreme court ke faisle kaa ghor ulanghan' qaraar diya
 a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled in August 2017 that privacy was the 'constitutional quintessence of human dignity' and the fundamental right of citizens
 supreme court ne yah faisla us mukademe kaa nibatara karte hue diya tha jisamen aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki sarkaar kii baari-bharkam aadhaar yojana nagarikon kii niztaa kaa ulanghan karti he
 Keeping the judgment on Aadhaar, the court recognized that a 'strong system' is needed in the matter of information technology and data security

 Officials claim that these rights were drawn up during the tenure of the Congress-led UPA government in 2009 and the current notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs makes it clear to the telecom companies which agencies have been given these rights

 Meanwhile, CBI has asked various social media platforms to use Microsoft's software 'photodna' to help in criminal investigations
 yah technology duniya bhar main keval bacchon ke saath yon badasluki or shoshan kii jaanch main istemaal kii jaati rahi he
 The proposed rules of privacy in Europe specifically seek to limit the use of this technology
 isaki vajah se vahaan yah vivaad chhid gaya ki in niyam-kaayadon se technology companiyon ke haath-pair is tarah baandhe ja rahe hai ki ve apane plateform par aisi saamagree ko hataa bhi nahin paa rahi hai
 There is no law in India that prevents the use of this technology in regular criminal investigations, while experts call this surveillance a violation of people's privacy
 sibar suraksha visheshgy subimal bhattacharya kehete hai, ''agar kisi ko ek tasviir kaa diene soshal media plateform par maujuud tasveeron ke diene se milaanaa ho, to in tasveeron ke diene kaa database bananaa hoga
 Meaning, there should be access to all the pictures put on these platforms
 yah nishchit taur par niztaa ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 "put this in the context of the CBI notice, it will give the agency access to all the uploaded pictures of the users, as the entire database will need to be scanned to match a suspected criminal
" bhattacharya daleel dete hai ki sarkaar ko itani ghuspaith karne vaali technology ke amal ke maargdarshan ke taur par samvidhan ke anuchhed 19(2) kaa istemaal karnaa chahie jo bolne kii aazaadee par munasib pabandi lagaataa he
 He says, "it should not be used indiscriminately, but it should be used in accordance with the provisions of Article 19 (2) in the interest of India's sovereignty and security, friendly relations with outside countries and public order"
 '' ve poochhate hai—saadhaaran aapraadhik jaanch main photodiene ke prayog ko kya in aadhaaron par jaij tehraaya ja saktaa he?ab bhi saaf nahin ki sibiai soshal media companiyon se is software kaa istemaal kaise karne kii ummid karti he
 The investigating agency has clenched its lips, but this technology is comprehensive and indiscriminate and gives the investigating authorities the authority to examine the entire database of photographs, even without having a particular suspect in their mind
 yah na keval logon kii niztaa ke adhikaar par supreme court ke faisle kaa balki vishisht manshaa kaa bhi ulanghan he kyonki photodiene aisa saadhan he jo bacchon ke shoshan se judi tasveeron ko share or prachaarit karne ko khatm kar degaa
 The government is also offering changes in information technology law to curb fake news, child pornography and other such things, in which critics are full of doubt and worry *** 22 sitambar se hi, jab tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri jayalalita ko aspataal main daakhil karavaaya gaya tha, unki party ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (ediemke) isi baat ko sabit karne main juty hui he ki unki haalat gambhir nahin he, jabaki doctoron kii taraf se die jane vaale medical apadeton main baar-baar or kaaphi antar aane kii vajah se yah atkal kaaphi jor pakade rahi he ki unki haalat kaaphi gambhir he

 uparashtrapati or rajyasabha ke sabhapati em
 Venkaiah Naidu today rejected Chief Justice Deepak Mishra after detailed deliberations with legalists on a notice given by Congress and other parties to 'remove him from office'
 darasal sijeai par mahabhiyog laane ke liye 20 april ko vipaksh ne venkaiya naidu ko 5 kaaran ginaae the
 To which he replied today and rejected the proposal
 ye the vipaksh ke CJI par 5 aarope1
 The first charge against the CJI Deepak Mishra was made by the opposition, especially the Congress, of poor conduct
 congress kaa aarope he ki sijeai deepak mishra kaa vyavhaar unke pad ke mutabik nahin he
 Answer - On this, Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu said that no such case has been raised against Deepik Mishra while holding the post of CJI, to doubt his behavior
 aapke paas bhi aarope ke alaava koi saboot nahin he
 2
 vipaksh ne sijeai par doosraa aarope prasad ajukeshan trust se phayda uthaane kaa lagaaya
 The opposition alleges that CJI Deepak Mishra influenced all the petitions filed in this case from an administrative and judicial perspective
 jawaab-prasad ajukeshan trust cese kii shuruaati jaanch main deepak mishra kaa naam liya ja rahaa tha
 But after extensive investigation, his role was not seen
 jahaan tak yachikaaon ko prashasnic or nyaayik pariprekshya main jaanch ko prabhavit karne kii baat he ki iske koi sakshya nahin he
 3
 vipaksh ne sijeai deepak mishra par supreme court ke roster main manamaane tareeke se badlaav karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The opposition says that the CJI shifted many important cases from the second bench to the other bench without giving any valid reasons
 jawaab-sijeai deepak mishra par supreme court ke roster main manamaane tareeke se badlaav kaa aarope galat he
 Because the Chief Justice has the authority to make the roster
 niyam ke mutabik CJI 'master of da roster' hote hai
 The issue was raised in the past, after which the Supreme Court, taking cognizance on its own, gave assurance of resolving the matter
 aise main deepak mishra par ab sawaal uthaanaa sahi nahin he
 4
 vipaksh ne sijeai deepak mishra par ahm keson ke bantwaare main bhedbhaav kaa aarope bhi lagaaya he
 The case of CBI Special Court BH Loya was given by the CJI to the Bench of Junior Judge Arun Mishra while senior judges
 jawaab-jahaan tak supreme court ke andar keson ke bantwaare ko lekar sawaal he to ye niyam ke mutabik kiya jaataa he
 The Supreme Court has its own rules under which it works
 aise maamalon main agar supreme court ke andar se sawaal uthte hai or nipataara andar hi kar liya jaataa he to ye nyaaypalika kii majbootee or khubsuurati ko darshata he
 5
 vipaksh ne sijeai par paanchvaan aarope jameen adhigrahan kaa lagaaya
 According to the opposition, Justice Deepak Mishra acquired the land in 1985 by showing a fake affidavit while being an advocate
 ediem ke aavanton radd karne ke baavjood aisa kiya gaya tha
 Answer - In 2012, after Deepik Mishra reached the Supreme Court, he surrendered the land
 aise main unhone khud niyamon kaa paalan kiya he
 Naidu said in the order that the allegations of misconduct leveled against Justice Mishra in this notice were prima facie found to be beyond the scope of Article 124 (4) of the Constitution and could not be considered worthy of further investigation
 yahi nahin, naidu ne kaha ki isamen lagaaye gayi aaropon kaa gambhirtha or saavdhaneepurvak vishleshan ke aadhaar par yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki ham vyavastha ke kisi bhi stambh ko vichaar, shabd yaa kaaryakalapon ke dwaara kamjor karne kii anumati nahin de sakate
 Salahnayudu, who took information from law experts, said that after detailed discussion with law experts and experts to discuss all the allegations and all aspects of its basis, i have come to the conclusion that this proposal is not acceptable
 is masale par purv mahasachiv (loksabhaa) dow
 Subhash Kashyap, former General Secretary (rajya Sabha) Dr
 vivek agnihotri, purv kanoon sachiv pi ke malhotra, purv kanoon sachiv dow
 Sanjay Singh, former Supreme Court judge KK Venugopal, Attorney General, former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi consulted several legal practitioners
 darasal rajyasabha sachivalay ke sutron ke anusaar naidu ne congress sahit saat dalon ke notice ko naamanzoor karne ke apane faisle kii jaankaree rajyasabha ke mahasachiv desh deepak verma ko de di he
 Confirming Naidu's decision, a senior official said, "the Chairman has asked Verma to inform the members who served the notice about the information being disallowed
 'gauratlab he ki congress sahit saat dalon ne nyaayamurti mishra ke khilaaf mahabhiyog chalaane ke liye shuukravaar ko uparashtrapati naidu ko notice diya tha
 The notice sought to initiate a 'process to remove him from the post of Chief Justice', accusing Justice Mishra of misconduct on five grounds
 raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar vipakshi netaa abhi yah tay nahin kar paa rahe hai ki aglaa kadam kya uthaaya jaae
 On Wednesday, the leaders of nine opposition parties gathered in the chairmanship of Ghulam Nabi Azad and discussed the presidential election in Delhi
 isamen gulam nabi aaazaad or mallikarjun khadge ke alaava lalu prasad yadav, sharad yadav, derek o bryan, seetaram yechuri, prafull patel, sharad yadav, satish chandra mishra or ramgopal yadav shaamil the
 But this meeting was inconclusive
 tay kiya gaya ki jab bijepi kii taraf se apane ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kar di jaaegi, uske baad hi vipaksh apana aglaa kadam tay karegaa
 On Wednesday afternoon, when Ghulam Nabi Azad was having this meeting, the news came that the BJP has formed a committee of three people for the presidential election, he has started contacting the leaders of the opposition
 vipakshi netaaon kaa asamanjas yah he ki jab takabijeypi kii taraf ssapane ummidavaar ke naam kii ghoshnaa nahin kii jaati tab tak vipakshi dalon ke bich kisi naam par sahmati jutanaa bhi mushkil hoga
 On Friday, Venkaiah Naidu and Rajnath Singh will meet Sonia Gandhi to discuss the BJP candidate
 mana ja rahaa he ki usee din bijepi ke ummidavaar kaa khulaasa hoga or uske baad vipaksh ke tay karegaa ki bijepi kaa ummidavaar unhen manjuur he yaa nahin
 Lalu Yadav, who came to attend the meeting, said that only Narendra Modi knows who will be the BJP candidate

 lekin sutron ke mutabik, rajya kii donon rajyasabha siton ke liye ek saath chunaav karwaae jane kii maang khaarij ho jane ke baad party ne faisla palat diya
 Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued that if separate elections are held for both the seats, BJP will win both the seats due to the 'first-past-the-post' system, as they have 20 more seats than the Congress
 There are more mlas
 unka kahana tha ki agar donon siton par ek hi din main ek saath chunaav karavaaya jaataa, to congress ek seat jeet sakati thi
 But according to the Election Commission, such elections are never conducted simultaneously

 america rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar james jones ne aaj bataaya, ‘‘haa, (bharat ko) hedli tak pahunch mil gayi he
 It is a continuous process and i do not have any detailed explanation, all i can say is that the issue is in the hands of appropriate professionals from both countries
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘hamane apni patibaddhta puri kii
 Jones, however, did not have detailed information about when and how access to Headley was made available to the team of Indian investigators who arrived in the US
 hedli ko chicago main pakadaa gaya tha
 He said, "we are very happy that in this world plagued by terrorist activities, both of us are making sure that whenever someone is arrested, we share information and intelligence with each other because it Are in the interest of both
 saath hi, aise vyakti se yadi kisi bhi paksh ko poochtacha karne main dilchaspee he to ham unke liye poochtacha kii vyavastha karaane kaa bhi prayaas karen
 However, when asked if access to Headley would be for one time only or more than once, he said, "I don't know but there is a feeling of cooperation between us and respect for each other's stance
" And it is very good
 hamane pehla kadam uthaaya he, ab hamen yah dekhnaa hoga ki iske baad bhi koi anurodh hota he yaa nahin
 When asked what this actually indicates, the US National Security Advisor said, "if i were a terrorist, this cooperation would have told me that India and the United States are working so closely with each other that My work is going to be a lot harder, and that's a good thing
 ’’jones ne kaha, ‘‘darasal hamen deshon ke bich aise network kii aavashyaktaa he jo unheen (aatankwaadiyon) kii tarah , unheen kii gati, sateekta or khulepan ke saath paraspar sahyog kare kyonki koi bhi aisa desh nahin he jo akele aatankwaad ke rakshas ko parrast kar sake

 uttar pradesh ke badanu main may maheene main do chacheri bahanon kii hatya ke maamle main giraftaar kiye gaye teen yuvakon ko sthaneey adaalat ne jamaanat de di he
 Two policemen arrested in this case have already been granted bail two days ago
 maamle kii jaanch kar rahi sibiai ne pichley hafte kaha tha ki vah in paanchon aropiyon ke khilaaf chargeshit daayar nahin karegi, jisase saaf ho gaya tha ki sibiai unki jamaanat yachika virodh nahin karegi
 CBI sources had said that there was no evidence linking the accused to the murder and that there was no sexual harassment before the death of both the victims
 iske baad upi police dwaara giraftaar paanch aropiyon - pappu, avadhesh or urvesh yadav (teen bhaaiyon) or sipaahi chatrapal yadav or sarvesh yadav ko jamaanat de di gai he, kyonki unke hiraasat main 90 din puure ho gaye hai

 dilli ke saketcortnedaati maharajake khilaaf daayar chargeshit par sangyaan lene se philhal inkaar kar diya he
 Delhi Police had filed a charge sheet against Dati Maharaj and his 3 brothers in the rape case some time back
 saket court ne dilli police kii jaanch par bhi sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki dilli police ne sahi tareeke se maamle main jaanch nahin kii
 The case is kept pending by the Saket court till further orders of the High Court
 isse pehle dilli hoicourt ne maamle main sibiai jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 Actually, a petition was filed in the High Court on behalf of the victim that even after registering her FIR, Dati Maharaj was not arrested in this case
 court ne bhi balaatkaar jaise gambhir aarope daati maharaj par lagane ke baad police kii jaanch par santushti jataate hue maamle ko sibiai ko transfar karte hue is maamle main apni jaanch report saunpane ke aadesh die the
 Now, when both the lower court and the High Court have questioned the investigation and charge sheet of the police so far, then the big question is why till now the police have not arrested Dati Maharaj in this case
 peedita kii taraf se daati maharaj par balaatkaar ke aarope ke saath saath prabhaavshaalee logon ke saath sampark kii baat bhi kii gai he
 It has also been said on behalf of the victim that several senior officers of the Delhi Police had already come and seen on Dati Maharaj's Shani Dham, so it is delaying the investigation
 peedita kaa kahana he ki apane inhen sambandhon or prabhaav kaa istemaal karte hue ab tak police kii giraft se dur he
 The victim is also afraid that her life has been threatened since the FIR was lodged in the rape incident and her fear has increased further due to the arrest of Dati Maharaj
 aise main hoicourt or nichali adaalat donon ko hi sibiai kii jaanch report kaa intjaar he
 So that it can be clear whether the investigation in this case was relaxed by the Delhi Police
 or agar aisa he to usamen koun-koun log doshi he
 It is possible that when the investigation of the case is proceeded by the CBI, then the difficulties and arrests of Daati Maharaj can increase

 Demonetisation has changed so many aspects since November 8 that even the government and the Reserve Bank must have forgotten where it started
 alabatta tex vaali kalabaji bejod he
 Why did the need to give black money a chance to turn white (after paying tax) before one month of the scheme came? Actually, the biggest success in the first week of demonetisation was to change into challenge and failure in the next few days
 
 dimonetigeshan ke baad bainkon main diposit kii baadh se kaali nakadi kaa akalan or notebandi kaa makasad hi patari se utarane laga he
 According to the Reserve Bank, deposits from November 10 to 27 and exchange of old notes 8
 44 lakh karod ru
 Arrived at
 apusht aankadon ke anusaar, 30 november tak diposit 11 lakh karod ru
 they were finished
 8 november ko notebandi se pehle bazaar main lagbhag 14 lakh karod ru
 High denomination (500 / 1000) notes were in circulation
 yani ki 30 november tak 63 se 75 fisadi nakadi bainkon main laut chuki he
 The deposit is about Rs 49,000 crore
 prati din se bade hai
 The scheme is open till 30 December
 aam logon ke bich hue survey bataate hai ki abhi kareeb 23 fisadi logon ne apane vaid puraane note bainkon main nahin jamaa karaae hai
 After demonetization, about 30 lakh new bank accounts have been opened
 bainkon se puraane noton kaa exange band ho gaya he, isliye ab diposit hi honge
 Bankers believe that 90 percent of the currency in circulation can be returned to banks
 diposit kii baadh ke do nishkarsh hameek—nakadi ke rup main kaala dhan tha hi nahin
 Deposit of small cash savings and expenses of common people is deposited
 ise bainkon main laana tha to itani takalif baantne kii kya jarurat thi? athwaado—bainkon kii mileebhagat se kaala dhan khaaton main pahunch gaya he
 Reports of misuse of Jan Dhan accounts confirm this
 dhyaan rahe ki notebandi kii safalataa ke do paimaane hai
 How much cash came to the banks and how much remained out of useless
 do—notebandi se hue nuksaan ke mukaable sarkaar ko kitni raashi mili he
 Now have a look at the loss figures: According to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, 1 as employment, forgiveness of toll, cost of printing of currency etc
 28 lakh karod ru
 Has been damaged isamen jidipi kaa nuksaan shaamil nahin he, jo kaaphi bada he
 Profits of companies, fall in stock market, loss of banks are yet to be counted
 prakriya puri hone ke baad radd hui nakadi paryaapt maatra main nahin hoti he to nuksaan kaa aankada, phaaydon ke akalan par baari padegaa
 Given the high figure of deposit floods and losses, the government had no way but to change the aspect
 isliye kaale dhan ko safed karne kii nai khidki kholi gai, jiske tahat kaala dhan kii ghoshnaa par 50 fisadi kar lagegaa or diposit kaa 25 fisadi chaar saal tak sarkaar ke paas jamaa rahegaa
 After being caught, the tax rate will go up
 inakam tex kii nai kavayad ke do spasht lakshya dikhte havepahala—behisaab diposit par baari tex se log hatotsahit ho jaaenge or jamaa main kami aegi
 This will leave some cash out of the banking system which will be successful
 doosraa—agar diposit nahin ruke to jamaa par tex or khaaton main roki gai raashi safalataa kaa aankada hogi
 Demonetization is an economic decision, whose immediate success will be proved by statistics, whether it is achieved by keeping cash out of banking or from tax
 sarkaar ko kaali nakadi ke radd hone yaa tex se mili raashi kaa khaasaa bada aankada dikhaanaa hoga jo is prakriya se hone vaale thos nuksaan (jidipi main giravat, rojgaar main kami, bainkon par boj) par baari pad sake
 It will take time to come up this figure, but in the first twenty days, some unique findings have been recorded in the account of demonetisation, which was unlikely
 bharat kaa banking system buree tarah bhrasht he
 It is not only dirty in giving loans but it can also be used in the washing of black money
 sarkaar ise kab saaf karegi?inakam tex kaa chaabuk taiyaar he
 The tax terror is about to return as well as the legal controversy over corruption and tax

 nau lakh karod ru
 crrs are lying idle in banks, which do not have enough bonds to invest nor can it be used for loans
 nai nakadi aane tak ise logon ko lautaanaa bhi sambhav nahin he
 It is the consumption expenditure of the common people, the demand of the economy which is lying idle in the bank accounts, the banks are being doubled by the cost of handling it while the people are standing in the queue of banks eating their sticks to withdraw their savings
 jaraa sochie, agar dimonetigeshan na hota to kya ham sachaaiyon se mukaabil ho pate? isliye in teen nishkarshon ko notebandi ke munaafe ke taur par darj kiya ja saktaa he, baaki hisaab-kitaab 30 disambar ke baad

 Even after Uttar Pradesh elections, the equation of power here is not clear
 congress ke saath gathbandhan karne vaali areldi ke adhyaksh ajit singh ne kaha he ki unki party gathbandhan dharm kaa paalan karegi
 Ajit Singh said that he would not take any decision about this without talking to the Congress
 iske alaava ajit singh ne samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan kii khabaron se bhi inkaar kiya he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the politics of coalition is getting heated
 areldi kii sapa ke saath jane kii khabaron par jahaan ek ore ajit singh ne viraam lagaaya, vahiin congress ne is maamle main saaf kar diya he ki jo bhi faisla hoga vah 6 march ko chunaav parinaam aane ke baad hi kiya jayega
 Congress leader Rashid Alvi said that it is not right to speculate on which party the Congress will ally with in Uttar Pradesh
 upi main gathbandhan ke maamle main bijepi ne ek baar phir saaf kar diya he ki vah kisi party ke saath nahin jaaegi
 While reports of RLD going with the SP put a stop to Ajit Singh, the Congress has made it clear in the matter that whatever decision will be taken will be done only after the result of the election on 6 March
 congress netaa raashid alvi ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main kis party ke saath congress gathbandhan karegi, is par abhi se kayaas lagaana thik nahin he
 In the case of alliance in UP, BJP has once again made it clear that it will not go with any party
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa ajam khan (azam Khan) dwaara 'khaaki undervir' ko lekar die bayaan par bhartiya janata party ne kadaa aitjaar jataayaa he
 Let me tell you that during an election rally Azam Khan (azam Khan) commented on BJP candidate Jaya Prada from Rampur, that i also know that she wears khaki underwear
 unhone (azam Khan) raily ke dauraan jaya pradaa par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki jisko ham oongli pakadakar rampur laae, aapane 10 saal jisase apana pratinidhitiv karaayaa
 
 
 It took you 17 years to understand its reality, in 17 days i got to know that the underwear under them is khaki color
 aaj khan (azam Khan) ke is bayaan par bijepi ne kadaa aitjaar jataayaa he
 Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson Chandramohan expressed grief over Azam Khan's statement
 unhone kaha ki yah behad abhadra or aapattijanak bayaan he or yah raajnneeti ke str main giravat kii ek paraakaashtha he
 This statement of Azam Khan reveals the real face of Samajwadi Party
 apane is bayaan se ajam khan ne yah to sabit kar diya he ki vah khud kya hai or ab janata ke saamne unka asli cheharaa aa gaya he
 He further said that the BSP, which is aligned with the Samajwadi Party, should clear its stand on this statement
 in sab ke bich mahila ayog ne ajam khan ke is bayaan ko kaaphi gambhirtha se liya he
 The commission has asked Azam Khan to clarify the matter
 rashtriya mahila ayog kii adhyaksh rekha sharma ne khan kii tippanee ko behad sharmnaak bataaya
 She said that the women's commission has sent them a show cause notice
 khan kii tippanee par pratikriya vyakt karte hue sharma ne twit kiya ki encidblyoo chunaav ayog se yah bhi anurodh karegaa ki unhen chunaav ladane se roak diya jaae
 Sharma reacted to the tweet of another person who had tweeted the alleged video of the SP leader
 ajam khan kaa apmanjanak tippanee vaala video kai soshal media citon par saajha kiya ja rahaa he
 However, Azam Khan has not taken the name of Jayaprada in this video but BJP is presenting it as a vulgar remark against Jaya
 gauratlab he ki jayaprada ne kuch din pehle ajam khan par hamalaa bolaa tha
 He had said that i used to consider Azam Khan as my brother, but he continued to call me sister and also wished me ill
 jaya pradaa ne aage kaha tha ki kya aapkaa bhai aapako naachne vaali ke taur par dekh saktaa he
 That was the reason i wanted to leave Rampur
 bataa den ki jaya pradaa ne 2004 or 2009 chunaav main samaajawaadee party ke tikat par jeet darj kii thi
 He was expelled from the party in 2010 for his involvement in anti-party activities and keeping in touch with Amar Singh
 dhyaan ho ki ajam khan ne kuch samay pehle jaya pradaa ko ek naachne vaali bataaya tha
 Jaya Prada had said that i had also spoken to Mulayam Singh ji
 maine unhen bataaya tha ki kis tarah se meri chhavi ko kharaab karne kii koshish ja rahi he
 But none of the leaders helped me
 yahi vajah thi ki main rampur chhodana chaahati thi
 Jaya Prada contested from Bijnor in UP in 2014, but lost to bjp's Naipal Singh
 kuch din pehle ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue vah bhavuk ho gai thim
 They said that i am being forced to leave Rampur
 maine rampur or sakriy raajnneeti isliye choda tha kyonki vah mere upar tejaab se hamalaa karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 Jaya Prada further said that she realized for the first time that she is now with a BJP party where she is safe
 unhone kaha tha ki main ab pehle kii tarah ronaa nahin chaahati
 i too have the right to live, and i will do so and so will your army
 jaya pradaa ne kaha tha ki mujhe bahut garv he ki maine bijepi kii sadasya lee, yah ek aisi party he jahaan mahilaon kii izzat or unhen suraksha kaa bhav karaayaa jaataa he
 It should be noted that voting is going to be held in Rampur on 23rd of this month

 a top official said this
 bharat ke mahatv kaa pataa ek din pehle america raashtrapati baraak obama kii pradhanmantri manmohan singh se hui baatcheet se bhi chalata he
 In which he spoke on Euro crisis, environment and bilateral issues
 manmohan singh kii ji20 shikhar sammelan main shaamil hone ke liye kii ja rahi yatra main adhikari ne kaha, 'standard and purs yah tay nahin karata he ki bricks main ham ek-duusare ke bare main kya sochenge
 Singh will also talk to BRICS leaders during this meeting
 adhikari ne kaha, 'unke (esendpy) paas dekhne kaa apana najariya he
 But we are a strong and developing economy
 ise hamase koi alag nahin kar saktaa he
 Manmoh Singh will meet Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and South African President Jacob Zuma in Mexico's resort town of Los Cabos
 ji20 shikhar sammelan ke liye ravaanaa hote samay nai dilli main manmohan singh ne kaha, 'bricks ke desh vaishvik arthvyavastha ke vikaas kii nai dhuree hai
 He said he would hold an informal BRICS meeting in Los Cabos as the president of the forum
 singh shanivaar se aath dinon kii videsh yatra par hai
 In addition to the G20 summit, he will also attend the Rio + 20 meeting on environment in Rio de Janeiro

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar loksabhaa main 16 march se pehle vidheyak ko rakhane par faisla karegi
 Moily said that the government is not going ahead with any fear on this issue because the Congress party has always taken bold decisions

 Omar said that the forces that have been enemies of the interests of Jammu and Kashmir have always tried to derail the peace talks between India and Pakistan and the terrorist attack is a step in that direction
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, ye (hamalavar) ve takate hai, jo hameshaa jammu-kashmir ke hiton kii dushman rahi hai, jinhone hameshaa shanti prakriya kii kisi bhi shuruyaat ko patari se utaarne kii koshish kii he

 The Chief Minister said that if the dialogue process is disrupted due to these attacks, then it would be an injustice to the sacrifices of the brave soldiers and civilians who gave their martyrdom
 tippaniyan He said, he did not give his martyrdom so that the terrorists succeed in their intentions
 unhone shanti ke liye apni jindagi di
 The Chief Minister said that Pakistan needs to be told in clear terms that things cannot remain normal if such attacks continue
 umr ne kaha, lekin yah sandesh hamen unhen aamane-saamne baithkar dena he
 Omar told reporters, "given our history and the time and location of the attacks, one thing is absolutely clear that the purpose of these terrorist attacks is to derail the proposed dialogue between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan

 He said, as far as we are concerned in this state, we have always been in favor of a peaceful solution to all the problems of this state and we hope that this is the path to be followed

 The Congress is embarking on a Jan Jagran Yatra led by three big leaders of the state - Kamal Nath, Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia - who will chase Chauhan by taking out rallies across the state and make people aware of the 'right situation'

 Congress spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi says, "it is a well thought out strategy
" ham bhaajapa ke ek-ek daawey kii pole kholenge
 "at the beginning of the bjp's visit to Ujjain's Nankhedi, Shah did not delay at all to taunt the Congress
" unhone kaha, ''main congressiyon se apil karata hum ki ve chouhan kii yatra ke peeche-peeche chalem or dekhen ki 19 rajyon main bhaajapa kii sarkaar kyon he

 On the other hand, Kamal Nath described Shivraj's roadshow as 'jan Chhalawa Yatra'
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ke kaarykram kaa sara intjaam rajya sarkaar kii ore se kiya gaya tha
 The Congress President also wrote a letter to Lord Mahakal Baba of Mahakal Temple, because Chauhan and Shah had worshiped here before starting the yatra
 kamalnath ne is patr main 2013 se chouhan ke jhuthe vaadon kii yaad dilaai thi
 Meanwhile, Chauhan will visit 230 assembly constituencies at Nagaud in Satna before concluding the yatra on 25 September
