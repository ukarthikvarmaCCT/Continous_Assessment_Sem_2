 The general public of the country is not disturbed by the rampant rising inflation and corruption
 mahangaai va bhrashtachar par lagaam kasne main khud ko laachaar paa rahe desh ke hukmran bhi kahin-na-kahin in baton se chintit hai
 There are clear indications of this from the speech of Congress President Sonia Gandhi in Jaipur
 rajyon main haar se manobal par asarajaipur main congress ke chintan shivi main sonia gandhi ne kaha ki party ke paramparaagat vot bank main send lagi he
 He admitted that the morale in the states had affected morale
 sonia gandhi kaa aisa kahana is baat kii ore ishaara karata he ki himachal pradesh main congress kii jeet bhi use gujarat main haar ke sadame se ubaar paane main aksham he
 The Congress also seems concerned that the public is no longer in a mood to give their prized votes to any party blindly
 ab kaa voter 'jaat par' na 'paant par', na 'kisi kii baat' par vot dene ko taiyaar he
 In the coming time, only the issue of development will attract voters effectively
 gutbaji khatm karne kii apilchintan shivi main sonia gandhi ne party ke netaaon se apil kii ki ve gutbaji khatm karke ekajutata se kaam len
 He stressed the need for better synergy between Congress Party and other components of UPA
 jaahir he sonia gandhi apni party ko har tareeke se un chunautiyon ke liye taiyaar kar rahi hai, jo aagaamee vidhansabhaon va loksabhaa chunaav main unhen vipaksh se milane kii sambhaavna he
 The 'narmada Parikrama Padayatra' of senior Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh was completed on Monday on the 192nd
 yah yatra madhya pradesh ke narsinghpur jile ke bermaan ghat main samaapt hui
 During this, Digvijay Singh had a special conversation with Aaj Tak and answered many questions in a no-nonsense manner
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki wo siyasat karenge, pakora nahin talenge
 70-year-old Digvijay, who was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh from the year 1993 to 2003, started the padyatra with his 46-year-old wife Amrita Rai after the Narmada Pujan on September 30 last year from Barman Ghat in Narsinghpur district
 digvijay, amrutha, purv saansadgan rameshwar nikhra or narayan singh amalabe sahit unke kai samarthak narmada nadi ke donon kinare takreeban 3,300 kilometre kii is padayatra karne ke baad somvaar subah bermaan ghat par pahunche
 Digvijay and his wife, after reaching the ghat, performed many religious rituals related to the completion of the padyatra
 is yatra ke samaapan par digvijay ko shubhakamanaayen dene ke liye purv kendriya mantrigan kantilal bhuriya, suresh pachori, madhya pradesh congress adhyaksh arun yadav or anya party netaaon ke alaava badi taadaat main log pahunche
 The Congress claims that during its padyatra, Digvijay has gathered a large amount of evidence related to corruption during the 14-year rule of the state bjp-led government and after concluding his visit, he will surely go on a large scale in Madhya Pradesh
 Will open the pole of corruption unhone apni is padayatra ke dauraan madhya pradesh kii 230 vidhansabha siton main se 110 siton kaa daura kiya
 At the end of the padyatra, Digvijay Singh and his wife Amrita gave open answers to Aaj Tak's questions
 pesh hai unase baatcheet kaa byoraa

 sawaal- aap congress mahasachiv pad par bane rahanaa chaahate hai?jawaab- maine yah faisla rahul gandhi par chhod diya he
 It is up to their conscience, but we are with them in every situation
 sawaal- sonia or rahul ke faislon main kai jagah fark dikhataa he
 Like in the Rajya Sabha elections, Rahul did not give tickets to people outside the state? Is Rahul doing better? Answer- Don't compare
 ye anuchit he
 Now we should leave the ground open for Rahul, so that he can take all possible decisions for his change in the party

 sawaal- kya rahul 2019 main modi ko haraa paaenge?jawaab- rahul koshish karenge or puri koshish karenge
 Question- Rahul said that he wants change in the party, but will give place to both young people and experienced people
 aise main kya aapaki jagah banati he?jawaab- meraa faisla to rahul karenge, lekin yuva or anubhav ke bich samanvay hona hi chahie
 Question- Should opposition parties come together to defeat Modi? Answer- Gorakhpur and Phulpur are examples

 The economy has collapsed
 jati or dharm ke naam par jhagada chintaa kaa vishay
 Question- It is being said that your organization is weaker than BJP
 lihaaja aap vipaksh ko ekajute karnaa chaahate hai?jawaab- aisa nahin he
 We do not want alliances everywhere
 haa, jahaan ham kamazor hai, vahiin gathjod chaahate hai
 In every state where we are not strong, there should be alliances
 sawaal- ek taraf sonia kahati hai ki rashtriya str par vipaksh ko ekajute honi kii jarurat, jabaki duusari taraf phulpur or gorakhpur main congress kaa ummidavaar utaarna or zamaanat nahin bachaa paanaa kahaan tak sahi he?jawaab- ye wo faisla tha, jo khud mujhe bhi samaj nahin aayaa ki kyon hua? lekin kyon hua isaki mujhe jaankaree nahin
 Digvijay Singh was accompanied by his wife Amrita
 unhone bhi ajtak ke sawaalon ke jawaab die
 Here are excerpts from his conversation
 
 
 sawaal- aap bataaie ki chah maheene digvijay singh ne koi siyaasi bayaan nahin diya? aapako kaisaa laga?jawaab- ek patni ko jaisaa mahasoos karnaa chahie, vaisaa kar rahi hum

 sawaal- aapane manokamana kya maangi?jawaab- dekhie, manokamana to bataai nahin jaati
 Question- Did you expect that Digvijay, famous for his political statements, would remain silent for six months? Answer- i know enough that he is determined and fulfills what he is determined to do
 aisa lag rahaa he ki lambii validity vaale preeped plance kaa trend badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Companies are probably doing this to keep customers with them for a longer period of time
 haal hi main hamane dekha ki kai companiyaan apane 365 dinon kii validity vaale preeped plance ko pesh kar rahi hai
 The number of such plans is gradually increasing
 ab kii baar vodaphone ne apana nayaa 1,999 rupee kaa preeped plan launch kiya he
 First of all, let us tell you that this new 1,999 prepaid plan of Vodafone has been launched for Kerala circle only
 saath hi company ne baaki cirkilon main bhi is plan kii uplabdhta ko lekar koi jaankaree nahin di he
 In Kerala, this plan has been kept open, i
e
 any customer of Kerala Circle can take advantage of this plan
 chunki ye plan yahaan open cirkil he isliye ummid he ki company jald hi ise deshbhar ke liye utaar sakati he
 Talking about the benefits of prepaid plan of Rs 1,999, the company is offering unlimited local, national and roaming calling
 jahaan tak data kii baat he to graahakon ko is plan main roj 1
 5GB 2G / 3G / 4G data will be available
 colling or data ke alaava graahakon ko roj 100 SMS bhi is plan ke tahat diya jayega
 The validity of this plan will be 365 days
 yani aap is plan ko lekar ek saal ke liye fursat ho sakate hai
 Vodafone Rs 1,999 VS Jio Rs 1,699 Reliance Jio started the trend of offering affordable earli plans in the country
 pichley saal company ne 1,699 yearli plan pesh kiya tha
 BSNL later launched a similar plan
 iske baad vodaphone idia or bharti airtel kaa bhi naam is list main jud gaya or in companiyon ne bhi 1,699 rupee ke preeped plance utaarne shuru kar die
 Jio 1 daily in prepaid plan of Rs 1,699
 5GB data, analimited wais kol or 365 dinon kii validity ke saath roj 100 SMS diya jaataa he
 Vodafone is also giving similar benefits in its plan
 lekin company iske liye 300 rupee zyada le rahi he or ye vodaphone kaa plan bhi abhi keval kerala main he
 In such a situation, only the plan of Jio can be understood
 sahitya ke sabase bade manch 'sahitya ajtak' kaa aaj doosraa din he
 The second day began with noted writer and lyricist Prasoon Joshi
 kaarykram ke 'dastak darbar' manch par prasoon joshi ke saath 'rahanaa tu, he jaisaa tu' mudde par charchaa hui
 This program was conducted by Shweta Singh
 prasoon joshi ne yahaan kaha ki unhen aaj is baat se aapatti he ki mahilaon ke liye sirf housewif kii sangya di jaati he or unhen non varking kaha jaataa he
 Prasoon said that such a noun denies the entire responsibility in which a mother makes an infant grow up to work
 unhone kaha ki aaj har wo cheez jisase paisa nahin kama rahe hai wo kaam kii nahin rah gai he
 It is not necessary that every person should be evaluated for money
 prasoon joshi ne kaha ki lekhak kaa judaav ek satya se hota he, jo ek insaan ko duusare insaan se, ek praani ko duusare praani se hota he
 He sees the pain of everyone and he brings the same thing to his writing
 is baat kaa zikr karte hue unhone gunagunaaya, ''
 
 
 May you be swept away by placing the head in the mother's dock ''
 ise padhein
 
 
 Sahitya Aaj Tak 2018: Prasoon Joshiwarishta writer Prasoon Joshi said on the stage of Dastak Darbar that when you try to write in true spirit, mistakes happen
 jo audiens ko pasand nahin he, to use riject karnaa shuru karnaa chahie
 He said that today we did not judge with the portrayal of women, whether visual or in some other way
 unhone samajhaayaa ki agar ek mahila ko dikhaa rahe hai jo police ke kapade pahane hui he or aap uske sharir ko hi dikhaa rahe hai to aapako is soch ko badalanaa hoga
 Film, art, songs everywhere have to change it
 
 
 
 Nazar Tori, Ghur Ghuram Ghuramprasun Joshi also heard one of his thumri during this time, he told that he wrote this thumri last night itself and is still to be completed
 najar tori, ghur ghuram ghurmanjar mori, jhuki jhuki rahe har dam
 
 
 Do not shy away from zucchini perspective
 
 Nakhon Mein Kachtu der Naahinigah Tori Lake Jalam Lakeam
 
 
 ab naa sahe jaae tir akhiyan kachubhat jaise shul shul shulam
 
 
 He said that he is using it further while maintaining the proximity of Thumri's limb
 jab unase poocha gaya ki vah mahilaon ke mudde par itnaa shandaar tareeke se kis prakaar likh pate hai to unhone kaha ki meri maa, daadi, bahan, patni kii vajah se mahilaon ke dard ko sahi tarah se samaj paata hum
 Prasoon said that now is the time to do over-correction in your art
 kuch chijen kanoon or vyavastha se badalati hai kuch ko samaaj ko hi badalanaa hota he
 It is necessary to catch the one who is abusing and not abusing
 
 
 varisht geetkaar ne kaha ki kabhi hinsa yaa mahila ke charitra ko kamedi ke naam par prastut karte hai to iskaa impact bahut bada hota he
 Some things are happening under the guise of tradition, when a person is abusing even while not abusing, it is necessary to catch him
 sensor board main kuch is prakaar ho rahaa he badlaav
 
 
 Apart from being a writer-songwriter, Prasoon Joshi is also the chairman of the censor board
 unhone ab kaha ki sensor board main maine koshish kii he, vahaan ke har afasar chaahate hai ki sahi tareeke se kaam ho
 He said that the work of CBFC is very difficult, we have to create a synergy between cinematic sensitivity and society
 unhone bataaya ki ek seen ke liye kisi vyakti ke liye kai matlab ho sakate hai
 Being sensitive to society is very important for art
 agar kala or audiens ke bich kaa conection tut gaya to bahut galat hoga
 Prasoon Joshi spoke about his many poems, songs, compositions during this discussion
 inamen 'ham sabhi main ek vyakti or hota he', 'bhuulaa chukaa hum us sandook ke angaaron ke neeche', 'apalak niharna saundarya ko, anubhuti kaa saundarya ban jaataa he' jaisi rachanaaen raheen

 aapako jawaab mil gaya hoga
 Do the work that the people of India have assigned to you and leave us on our condition
 aap eemaandaar rahenge to ham bhi khushhaal rahenge
 If your honesty declines, Bihar will again join the Bimaru state
 puure chunaav yahi lagate rahaa ki bihar main nitish kumaar ke mukaable aapahi khadeyn hai, isliye aaj aapako likh rahe hai
 We had started hoping that you would become the Chief Minister of Bihar, leaving the post of Prime Minister, but you had not announced it, so i could not believe it
 nahin to aapke tamaam ulhanon ke baavjood aapako hi siem banaate
 Modiji you do not lose
 nitishji kii jeet nahin hui he
 This victory is ours
 ham bihar kii janata kii
 We have never lost
 kuch netaaon ne thaan lee thi bihar ko haraane kii, lekin wo naakaamayaab rahe
 If your intentions are not right, you can never win
 aapke bhaashanon ko sunne aapaki raily main jaaya karte the
 Expecting that you will do some meaningful things in a meaningful way
 lekin aapane kya kiya
 
 
 You started by questioning DNA
 aapke paas muddon kii kami nahin thi
 When you question someone's identity, will you leave like this? We are the people of Bihar, do not let go empty handed
 makul jawaab diya
 Millions of people have sent you after getting their DNA tested
 ab samay mili to adhyayan kar lijiega
 If it was Jala Raj then it was necessary that you keep talking about Jungle Raj
 aapane kabhi uske duusare pahalu ko nahin dekha
 Lalu Prasad had done the work which the Election Commission could not do in 40-45 years of independence
 rajya ke lakhon pichhadon ko raajnneeti kii mukhyadhara main shaamil kar loktantric prakriya ko majboot karne vaale lalu prasad kaa raaj agar jangalraj tha to aise raaj kii jarurat thi
 What did you understand the people of Bihar? Without disclosing to whom you will sit on the Chief Minister's post, we were expecting us to support you? How would it be possible? You do not become a CM yourself, then you do not know who would be your own CM? Our right too, like begging Diambaru, how long will you keep hiding the failures of the leaders
 agar koi rajya pichad rahaa he to apane netaaon kii naakamayaabiyon kii vajah se, unki beimaanion kii vajah se, unki galat nitiyon ke kaaran
 Where is the public in this? uski galati kahaan he
 But a sick person becomes a resident of the state
 aap aae or kah kar chale gaye
 You went after complaining about your mistake to us
 yah to had thi
 You announced to give what we had right as begging
 bihar kaa itihaas aisa nahin rahaa he
 Bihar has been a very prosperous land
 gyaan-vigyaan or shiksha main itane bhi pichde nahin rahe hai ham
 No one is the leader of casteism bigger than you
 You do not do caste politics, but in Bihar, you have not separated from it
 
 
 
 And you call us racist? We could not see the leader of casteism bigger than you
 aap kam se kam isse alag apni baat kar sakate the
 We are like that paddy bitumen who disintegrate and increase yields
 desh ke kisi rajya main chale jaae ham aapako mil jaaenge
 Our labor has enriched many states and is still doing so
 ise aap hamaari kamajori samajhate hai ham apni takat
 The economy of the state from which we will leave will go with us
 aisa yakeen he hamaara
 Will try it if you want
 jaaniye aapke vidhansabha kshetra se koun jitaab vakt mili to sochiega modiji
 
 
 Mr
 Modi, i will think if i get time
 na ham haare hai na ham haarenge
 Our DNA must have told you who and what we are
 aapako hamaare rajya kii janata ne bataa diya hoga ki bihari hone ke myne kya hai

 In the program of 'aaj Tak', Computer Baba said that before joining the government, he had laid the condition of preventing clean and illegal mining, securing monasteries and cow protection

 But after 6 months, Shivraj refused his promise
 mahamandaleshwar computer babaaka kahana he ki rajya mantri banate hi unhone 6 maheene tak narmada ke taton par bhraman kiya
 Motivated people to plant trees, plant trees themselves
 lekin jab 6 maheene baad shivaraj ko apane vaade yaad dilaae gaye to unhone kaha ki ab kuch nahin ho saktaa he kyonki chunaav saamne he
 According to the computer baba, Shivraj asked Narmada to mine him
 math mandir main se colector kaa naam hataakar pujari kaa naam likhane or gau raksha ke liye niti banane kaa vaada kiya tha
 But later he retracted
 computer baba ke mutabik madhya pradesh main jagah-jagah gaayen mar rahi hai, sadhu-santon kii sthiti kharaab hoti ja rahi he
 But the Shivraj government has nothing to do with it
 ye sarkaar sant virdohi he
 Baba said that he was hurt by the attitude of the government
 isliye ek oktober ko dharm sabha main nirnay liya ki ab mantripad kaa tyaag kar dena chahie
 He says that yasadhu-santshivraj will definitely teach a lesson in elections

 100 huts of saints were destroyed in Chitrakoot
 sant samaaj is sarkaar se behad dukhi he
 We have seen that this is a government of lawlessness
 isamen dharm naam kii koi cheez nahin he

 When the flight number 682 of Kantas departed from Adelaide to Melbourne, it was as if all the atmosphere of doubt and disappointment was left behind
 pichhali raat bhartiya team ke 15 sadasyon or yahaan jute lagbhag 25,000 prashansakon ke liye badi dhamaakedaar rahi
 India made a great start to their campaign for the World Cup
 vishwa cap main ek baar phir pakistani team bharat se maat kha gai
 This dream was getting a new flight - India can win the World Cup
 ek baar phir
 Forget that before that match, India did not win any victory in 84 days on Australian soil
 yah bhi bhula dijie ki pakistani team main in halaat se nibatane kii abhi taiyaari nahin thi or pichley vijeta bharat ko abhi zyada chunauteepurn sthitiyon main badi or majboot tiimon se muqabla karnaa baaki he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his team members were seriously thinking about the game in Melbourne on the night of 29 March, during that flight and perhaps for the first time in the tour
 pehali jeet ke baad bada jashn manaane kaa to zyada vakt nahin tha lekin khilaadi intercantinental hotel main khushi jaahir karne ke liye ikattha hue the
 Captain Dhoni reminded everyone of the individual roles set by the team management and motivated them to put in an extra ten percent effort
 jab team ne melbern pahunchakar langham hotel main check in kar liya to dhoni ne dhoop kaa chashma utarkar muskaraate hue media ke logon se poocha, ''lunch kar liya?''sachin tendulkar team kii shuruyaat se kaaphi romanchit hai or aage ke liye badi ummiden rakhte hai
 After watching the india-pakistan match with his close friends in a theater like atmosphere, Tendulkar told Aaj Tak, "I am very impressed with the way my bowlers run and the agile and aggressive fielding
" maine apane doston se kaha he ki ve team se or behatar pradarshan kii ummid rakh sakate hai
 "team director Ravi Shastri also said the same thing during practice in Melbourne two days after the Adelaide match," Tendulkar is right
 hamen har jeet kaa lutf lekar sakaaratmak bane rahanaa hoga
 The rest of the teams should be afraid of us
 ''abhi to yah shuruyaat he
 But the indications are clear which are the top three teams
 australia, dakshin africa or newjiland saaf taur par aage hai or agar bharat ne apni lay banaae rakhi to vah in teenon ke saath semifinal main pahunch sakati he
 The format of the tournament is such that India's team will reach the last eight but if they join South Group in their group and make it to the top two teams, then they will avoid the host teams on their home ground in the quarter-finals
 —australia to Adelaide and New Zealand to Auckland
 purv bhartiya captain saurabh ganguli ne melbern main india today se kaha, ''vaise to main itani dur kii sochane ke haq main nahin rahata lekin agar yah sambhaavna sach ho jaati he to bharat ko quarter final main srilanka yaa england se aasaan muqabla mil saktaa he
 If you win there, you are only two wins away from winning the cup
 ''lekin is sapane ke najadik pahunchane ke liye bhartiya ballebaaji ko takat dikhaani hogi
 While the search for the form of Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina in Adelaide was finally completed, Virat Kohli started the World Cup exactly the same way as in 2011 - with a brilliant century
 rohit sharma or rahane pehle hi acchhee oochaal vaali samtal pichon par tirchhe balle se shot khilne kii apni kaabiliyat kii jhalak dikhaa chuke hai
 The only thing to worry about is Dhoni's lack of batting in the last over
 tendulkar kehete hai, ''mujhe yakeen he ki jarurat padane par dhoni kaa balla chal nikalegaa
 "india's biggest problem is his bowling
" haalanki pakistan ke khilaaf gendbaaj prabhavi rahe lekin tagade pratidwandviyon ke saamne unke liye yah itnaa aasaan nahin rahegaa
 The teams of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have batsmen playing strong shots
 unke khilaaf 300 kaa score surakshit nahin rahegaa
 Raman Raja, a key member of Imran Khan's 1992 World Cup winning team and former Pakistani captain, says, "in the end, it comes to leadership
" bharat main haal main dhoni kii aalochana hui lekin mujhe aksar dhoni main imran kaa aks najar aata he
 They have to touch the climax at the right moment, wait for the opportunity and hit them dead
 vaise to mujhe is baar upmahadweep kii kisi bhi team ke cap jeetne kii gunjaaish kam lagati he lekin agar koi jeetta he to vah bharat hi hoga
 "for a team that had forgotten the taste of victory in the last three months, three things will be important - form, fitness and passion
 kuch khiladiyon ko chhod den to baaki kaa form betaratib rahaa he, udhar lig maichon kaa swaroop chhitput choton ko bhi durust kar degaa kyonki do maichon ke bich lagbhag haftebhar kaa antaraal he
 The challenge will be to maintain the spirit
 dhoni ne team se kaha he ki vah australia main pichley dinon test or vanade siries main mili haar ke peeche chhipe phaayde ko samajhe
 Even if you have lost, the performance of the Indian team has also improved by playing continuously against a strong team like Australia
 unka mantra sidhaa-sada he: ''dimagi jakadan dur kar lo—haar ke dar ko apane bheetar ghar mat karne do
 Whatever you have learned, make it your strength
 ''team prabandhan ne vibhinn tiimon ke saath mukaable ke liye khaakaa taiyaar kiya he, unki majbootiyon, kamajoriyon or pramukh khiladiyon kii manodasha kii bhi jaankaree jutai he
 "we have been asked to watch the highlights of the 2013 Champions Trophy win against South Africa in Cardiff — how we kept an aggressive stance right from the start and they got caught in the trap," said one player
 ''udhaaharan ke taur par pakistan ke khilaaf match ke liye raina kii taiyaariyon main bollywood kii border or elosi kargil jaisi filmein dekhnaa shaamil tha
 Similarly, bowlers were asked to keep the batsmen playing habitual strokes and wait for them to make mistakes
 abhi to yah anumaan lagaana bhi jaldbaaji he ki kya bharat aakhir tak kaa safar tay kar paaegaa, lekin ek shandaar shaam ne karodon bharatiyon ke sapane ko jagaa hi diya he
 Head coach of the New Zealand cricket team Mike Hewson has resigned from his post
 hesan ne kaha he ki vah july ke ant main team se alag ho jaaenge
 Hewson has decided to part ways after serving the Kiwi team for six years
 guuruuvaar ko oakland main yojit samvaadadaata sammelan main hesan ne apane istife ke pushti kii

 vah antaheen antarrashtriya cricket se tang aa gaye hai or ab apane bacchon or patni ke saath samay bitaana chaahate hai

 cricket newjiland ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari (CEO) david white ne kaha he ki unhone hesan ko team ke saath england tathaa wales main agle saal hone vaale world cap tak bane rahane ke liye manaaya, lekin vah nahin maane
 In such a situation, the Kiwi Cricket Board decided to honor his decision
 madam tusaad museum main viraat kohli kii mom kii pratimaa kaa anaavaranhesan ne apane bayaan main kaha, 'is kaam main 100 fisadi samarpan kii jarurat he or aaj main jis tarah ke halaat se guzar rahaa hum, use dekhte hue eemaandaaree se kahuun to main is ahm kaam ke saath nyaay karne kii sthiti main nahin hum

 Consider this one more time that when the raw material arrives in a factory, even before coming, it comes somewhere by paying tax, after coming out of the factory, then it is taxed, after that when the other state shop But when taken, there are many types of octroi on the way, then when you buy at the shop, you pay VAT called VAT
 in sabko ham indiarect tex yani apratyaksh kar kehete hai
 It is now being said that Falana Dhimakana tax will be replaced by a tax, GST i
e
 Goods and Services Tax
 vitt mantri ne is tex ke bare main kaha he ki jis tarah se desh kaa raajnneetik ekikaran 1947 main hua usee tarah se aarthik ekikaran nahin ho sakaa
 With the introduction of GST, the indirect tax system will become uniform
 tex kii ugaahi badhegi or jidipi ko bhi laabh hoga
 All the same claims were made at the time of introduction of VAT, but after that another tax came service tax
 ab ek or tex aa rahaa he jiesti
 We have been discussing this for 12 years
 - 2003 main vaajapeyi kaal main kelkar cameti ne jiesti kii charchaa shuru kii thi
 - Today the Finance Minister said that in 2006 it was announced by the Congress
 - lekin 2011 main samvidhan sanshodhan laane ke baad bhi raajnneetik dalon or rajyon main sahmati nahin ban saki
 The bill lapsed in the 15th Lok Sabha, in December 2014, the Modi government introduced it again in the Lok Sabha
 - or may 2015 main ye loksabhaa main paas hua
 Let us leave the political issue as it is going to be equal
 matlab tab congress kahati thi ki bijepi lagu nahin hone de rahi he or ab bijepi kah rahi he ki congress lagu nahin hone de rahi he
 Then Manmohan Singh used to say that BJP has not recovered from the 2004 defeat and now Jaitley says that the Congress has not recovered from the 2014 defeat
 3 may 2014 ke apane twit main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha tha Chidambaram says that Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat are not allowing GST to be implemented
 hamen is par garv he kyonki maujuuda rup main lagu ho gaya to vinaashkari hoga
 In this tweet, Shivraj Singh Chauhan is proud to protest the Gujarat bijaf, while three months ago in February 2014, as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the current Prime Minister's tweet said, 'I have made it clear that BJP has never opposed GST But without complete IT infrastructure it will be difficult to implement GST
 ' We do not know whether the complete IT framework for GST has been prepared in this one year or not
 congress ke banaae bill ko bhi standing cameti ne kai bade badlaav kar diye the
 But before talking about the aspect of Congress BJP, it is important that we and you understand about GST
 samvidhan sanshodhan bill hone ke kaaran jiesti ko rajyasabha main do tihaai bahumat se paas hona he
 Then after that half the states will also pass with two-thirds majority and then GST will be implemented
 sarkaar kaa lakshya he ki 2016 main lagu kar diya jaae lekin is lakshya ke kuch duusare mukaam or bhi hai
 To bring GST into operation
 
 
 - ek jiesti council banegi, jiske mukhiya kendriya vitt mantri honge
 - Among the members will be Union Minister of State for Finance, Finance Minister of States
 - council main koi bhi faisla teen chauthai maton se hoga
 - Only GST Council will decide what the GST tax rate will be
 exise duty, customs duty, cells tex, kai prakaar ke cells, sarvice tex, octroy yani chungi, naanaa prakaar ke apratyaksh kar aapane sune hi honge
 Through these taxes, the central government and the government of every state earns their own
 jaise haal main hi dilli sahit kai rajyon ne milakar petrol par excise duty badha di
 Prices went up
 jaise ek baar kisi rajya ne excise duty kam kar petrol kii keemton main raahat di thi
 i do not know whether the states will be able to increase the tax reduction in this way after GST
 piares legislative research kii site par jiesti ko thodaa saral tareeke se samajhaayaa gaya he jiske anusaar
 
 
 - It is being claimed that now there will be a tax in place of various types of tax
 - lekin is ek tex ke bhi teen prakaar bataaye ja rahe hai
 - Center GST, State GST and Inter State GST
 kaccha tel, hai speed deazal, petrol, prakritik gas, alcohol, cigarette ko jiesti kii suchi se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 It is important to understand that GST will not be located where something is made, rather it will be directly where it is sold
 isliye kai rajyon ko bhay he ki jiesti ke aane se unka rajasav kam ho jayega kyonki jin rajyon main vastu kaa utpaadan hota he vahaan tex nahin lagegaa, isse unki kamai kam ho jaaegi
 The central government has promised to make up for it and has asked for an additional tax of one percent
 waite ke samay bhi zyada se zyada tex ugaahne or kaala dhan na banane kaa daawa kiya gaya tha
 You must have known whether this happened or not
 ab jiesti ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki ek tex hoga to puure desh main daam kam hon jaayenge
 Now to understand this debate, some technical things have to be made in the mind
 - jaise kapadaa banane se pehle aap dhaagaa kharidte hai
 - It is called raw material and it is taxed
 - us dhaage main vailu tab judati he jab usase kapadaa banataa he
 - If you add value, then it is taxed separately
 - thok or khudara dukandaar ko bhi tex dena hota he
 Applying tax at different stages increases the price of something, we call it cascading effect
 jaise taash ke pattey dher ho jate hai usee tarah se ek ko chune se baaki bhi dhire-dhire girane lagate hai or girane kii raftaar bad jaati he
 Similarly, tax is levied at such a stage in the current tax system that the price of things increases
 jiesti main daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki cascading effect kam ho jayega
 That is, the price of things will be reduced
 alag-alag rajyon kii chungi se chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 Your bat will be bat
 jidipi bad jaaegi or tex collection badhegaa yani kaala dhan kam hoga
 What will be the rate of GST? tex ko lekar bhi sapane suhane ho sakate hai
 But how much tax will be levied
 27 pratishat yaa 18 pratishat
 Will it be easily agreed upon? iske alaava bhi kai sawaal bhi uth rahe hai
 The comments - amir or garib ke istemaal kii chizon par sarkarein alag-alag tex lagaati hai
 - This gap will disappear after the introduction of GST
 - aam aadmi ke istemaal kii chizon ke daam badhenge yaa ghatenge
 - What will happen to small industries and unorganized sector industries
 - abhi unhen excise duty main kai prakaar kii raahat milti he
 - Due to this exemption many industries have been able to stand
 - ab agar in par tex laga to kya ve bade udyogon kaa saamana kar paayenge
 What will happen if GST is imposed on millions of small industries and businesses
 2016 main lagu hua to shuruaati saal main iske jhanjhaton kaa bhi sarkaar ko andaaza to hoga hi
 In this case, i have neither a better understanding nor opinion
 akhabaaron or iconomic and polytical vikali main chape lekhon ko padhakar aapke liye ye sab taiyaar kiya he
 Will try to understand about the possibilities and apprehensions of GST in a simple way
 ab kaha ja rahaa he ki falana dhimkaana tex hataakar ek tex lagegaa, jiesti yani guds and services tex
 The Finance Minister has said about this tax that economic integration could not happen in the same way as the political integration of the country in 1947
 jiesti aane se apratyaksh kar pranali ek samaan ho jaaegi
 Tax levies will increase and GDP will also benefit
 waite lagu hone ke vakt bhi yahi sab daawey hue the lekin uske baad ek or tex aa gaya sarvice tex
 Now another tax is coming GST
 12 saal se ham is par charchaa kar rahe hai
 In 2003, during the Vajpayee era, Kelkar Committee started discussion of GST
 - aaj vitt mantri ne kaha ki 2006 main congress ne isaki ghoshnaa kii thi
 But even after the introduction of the constitutional amendment in 2011, there was no consensus among political parties and states
 - 15veen loksabhaa main yah bill laps kar gaya, disambar 2014 main modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa main ise dobaaraa pesh kiya
 - And in May 2015 it passed in the Lok Sabha
 raajnneetik masale ko chhod dete hai kyonki iz ikval tu hone lagegaa
 Meaning, then the Congress used to say that the BJP is not going to implement and now the BJP is saying that the Congress is not allowing it to be implemented
 tab manmohan singh kehete the ki bijepi 2004 kii haar se ubar nahin pai he or ab jetali kehete hai ki congress 2014 kii haar se ubar nahin pai he
 In his tweet dated 3 May 2014, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said chidambaram kehete hai ki madhyapradesh or gujarat jiesti lagu hone nahin de rahe hai
 We are proud of it because it would be disastrous if implemented in the current form
 is twit main shivaraj singh chouhan gujarat ke bihalf par virodh karne kaa garv kar rahe hai jabaki teen maheenaa pehle farvari 2014 main gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par maujuuda pradhanmantri kaa twit he ki 'maine saaf kiya he ki bijepi ne kabhi jiesti kaa virodh nahin kiya he lekin bina mukammal iti dhaanche ke jiesti ko lagu karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 ' hamen nahin maaloom ki jiesti ke liye mukammal iti kaa dhaancha is ek saal main taiyaar hua he yaa nahin
 The Standing Committee had also made several major changes to the Congress made bill
 lekin congress bijepi ke pahalu par baat karne se pehle zaruri he ki ham or aap jiesti ke bare main samajhen
 GST has to be passed by a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha due to the Constitution amendment bill
 phir uske baad aadhe rajya bhi do tihaai bahumat se paas karenge tab jaakar jiesti lagu hoga
 The government aims to be implemented in 2016, but there are other steps to this goal
 jiesti ko oparation yani amal main laane ke liye
 
 
 - a GST Council will be formed, headed by the Union Finance Minister
 - sadasyon main kendriya vitt rajya mantri, rajyon ke vitt mantri honge
 - Any decision in the council will be made by three fourths of votes
 - jiesti council hi tay karegi ki jiesti tex rate kya hoga
 Excise duty, customs duty, sales tax, many types of sales, service tax, octroi, octroi and many other types of indirect taxes must be heard
 in karon ke madhyam se centre sarkaar or har rajya kii sarkaar apni kamai karti he
 Like recently several states including Delhi increased excise duty on petrol
 daam bad gaye
 For example, once a state reduced excise duty and gave relief in petrol prices
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki jiesti ke baad rajya is tarah se tex gata badha sakenge yaa nahin
 GST is explained in a slightly simpler way at the site of PRS Legislative Research according to which
 
 
 - daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki ab naanaa prakaar ke tex kii jagah ek tex lagegaa
 - But three types of this one tax are also being mentioned
 - centre jiesti, state jiesti or inter state jiesti
 Crude oil, high speed diesel, petrol, natural gas, alcohol, cigarettes are excluded from the GST list
 yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki jiesti vahaan nahin lagegaa jahaan koi chiz banati he balki sidhe vahiin lagegi jahaan wo bikati he
 Therefore, many states fear that with the introduction of GST their revenue will be reduced because the states where the goods are produced will not be taxed, this will reduce their earnings
 centre sarkaar ne isaki bharpai kaa vaada kiya he or ek pratishat kaa atirikt tex lagane kii baat kii he
 Even at the time of VAT, there was a claim of maximum tax collection and no black money
 aisa hua yaa nahin aap jaanate hi honge
 Now it is being said about GST that if there is a tax, the prices will be reduced in the whole country
 ab is bahes ko samajhane ke liye kuch takneekee baton kii tasviir dimag main banani hogi
 - Like you buy yarn before making cloth
 - ise kaccha maal kehete hai or is par tex lagata he
 - The value is added to the thread when the fabric is made from it
 - vailu judi to uske liye alag se tex laga
 - Wholesale and retail shopkeepers also have to pay tax
 alag-alag charan par tex lagane se kisi chiz kii keemat badhati jaati he, ise ham cascading effect kehete hai
 As the cards are piled up, in the same way, touching one, the rest also slowly starts falling and the speed of falling increases
 isi tarah se maujuuda kar pranali main itane charan par tex lagata he ki chizon kii keemat bad jaati he
 It is being claimed in GST that the cascading effect will be reduced
 yani chizon ke daam kam ho jaaenge
 Taxation of individual states will get rid of
 aapaki balle balle ho jaaegi
 GDP will increase and tax collection will increase i
e
 black money will decrease
 jiesti kii dar kya hogi
 Dreams can be pleasant about tax too
 lekin kitna tex lagegaa
 27 percent or 18 percent
 kya is par aasaani se sahmati ban jaaegi
 Apart from this, many questions are also arising
 tippaniyan - Governments levy different taxes on the use of the rich and poor
 - jiesti ke aane ke baad yah antar mit jayega
 - Price of things used by common man will increase or decrease
 - chote udyogon or asangathit kshetra ke udyogon kaa kya hoga
 - Right now they get many types of relief in excise duty
 - is chhot ke kaaran kai udyog khadey ho sake hai
 Now if they are taxed, will they be able to face big industries
 lakhon chote udyogon or kaarobaaron par jiesti laga to kya hoga
 If implemented in 2016, the government will have an idea of its problems in the initial year
 jo bhi he is maamle main meri koi na to behatar samaj he or na raay
 All these have been prepared for you by reading articles printed in newspapers and Economic and Political Weekly
 prayaas karenge saral tareeke se jiesti kii sambhaavnaaon or ashankaon ke bare main samajhane ke liye
 All the same claims were made at the time of introduction of VAT, but after that another tax came service tax
 ab ek or tex aa rahaa he jiesti
 We have been discussing this for 12 years
 - 2003 main vaajapeyi kaal main kelkar cameti ne jiesti kii charchaa shuru kii thi
 - Today the Finance Minister said that in 2006 it was announced by the Congress
 - lekin 2011 main samvidhan sanshodhan laane ke baad bhi raajnneetik dalon or rajyon main sahmati nahin ban saki
 The bill lapsed in the 15th Lok Sabha, in December 2014, the Modi government introduced it again in the Lok Sabha
 - or may 2015 main ye loksabhaa main paas hua
 Let us leave the political issue as it is going to be equal
 matlab tab congress kahati thi ki bijepi lagu nahin hone de rahi he or ab bijepi kah rahi he ki congress lagu nahin hone de rahi he
 Then Manmohan Singh used to say that BJP has not recovered from the 2004 defeat and now Jaitley says that the Congress has not recovered from the 2014 defeat
 3 may 2014 ke apane twit main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha tha Chidambaram says that Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat are not allowing GST to be implemented
 hamen is par garv he kyonki maujuuda rup main lagu ho gaya to vinaashkari hoga
 In this tweet, Shivraj Singh Chauhan is proud to protest the Gujarat bijaf, while three months ago in February 2014, as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the current Prime Minister's tweet said, 'I have made it clear that BJP has never opposed GST But without complete IT infrastructure it will be difficult to implement GST
 ' We do not know whether the complete IT framework for GST has been prepared in this one year or not
 congress ke banaae bill ko bhi standing cameti ne kai bade badlaav kar diye the
 But before talking about the aspect of Congress BJP, it is important that we and you understand about GST
 samvidhan sanshodhan bill hone ke kaaran jiesti ko rajyasabha main do tihaai bahumat se paas hona he
 Then after that half the states will also pass with two-thirds majority and then GST will be implemented
 sarkaar kaa lakshya he ki 2016 main lagu kar diya jaae lekin is lakshya ke kuch duusare mukaam or bhi hai
 To bring GST into operation
 
 
 - ek jiesti council banegi, jiske mukhiya kendriya vitt mantri honge
 - Among the members will be Union Minister of State for Finance, Finance Minister of States
 - council main koi bhi faisla teen chauthai maton se hoga
 - Only GST Council will decide what the GST tax rate will be
 exise duty, customs duty, cells tex, kai prakaar ke cells, sarvice tex, octroy yani chungi, naanaa prakaar ke apratyaksh kar aapane sune hi honge
 Through these taxes, the central government and the government of every state earns their own
 jaise haal main hi dilli sahit kai rajyon ne milakar petrol par excise duty badha di
 Prices went up
 jaise ek baar kisi rajya ne excise duty kam kar petrol kii keemton main raahat di thi
 i do not know whether the states will be able to increase the tax reduction in this way after GST
 piares legislative research kii site par jiesti ko thodaa saral tareeke se samajhaayaa gaya he jiske anusaar
 
 
 - It is being claimed that now there will be a tax in place of various types of tax
 - lekin is ek tex ke bhi teen prakaar bataaye ja rahe hai
 - Center GST, State GST and Inter State GST
 kaccha tel, hai speed deazal, petrol, prakritik gas, alcohol, cigarette ko jiesti kii suchi se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 It is important to understand that GST will not be located where something is made, rather it will be directly where it is sold
 isliye kai rajyon ko bhay he ki jiesti ke aane se unka rajasav kam ho jayega kyonki jin rajyon main vastu kaa utpaadan hota he vahaan tex nahin lagegaa, isse unki kamai kam ho jaaegi
 The central government has promised to make up for it and has asked for an additional tax of one percent
 waite ke samay bhi zyada se zyada tex ugaahne or kaala dhan na banane kaa daawa kiya gaya tha
 You must have known whether this happened or not
 ab jiesti ke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki ek tex hoga to puure desh main daam kam hon jaayenge
 Now to understand this debate, some technical things have to be made in the mind
 - jaise kapadaa banane se pehle aap dhaagaa kharidte hai
 - It is called raw material and it is taxed
 - us dhaage main vailu tab judati he jab usase kapadaa banataa he
 - If you add value, then it is taxed separately
 - thok or khudara dukandaar ko bhi tex dena hota he
 Applying tax at different stages increases the price of something, we call it cascading effect
 jaise taash ke pattey dher ho jate hai usee tarah se ek ko chune se baaki bhi dhire-dhire girane lagate hai or girane kii raftaar bad jaati he
 Similarly, tax is levied at such a stage in the current tax system that the price of things increases
 jiesti main daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki cascading effect kam ho jayega
 That is, the price of things will be reduced
 alag-alag rajyon kii chungi se chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 Your bat will be bat
 jidipi bad jaaegi or tex collection badhegaa yani kaala dhan kam hoga
 What will be the rate of GST? tex ko lekar bhi sapane suhane ho sakate hai
 But how much tax will be levied
 27 pratishat yaa 18 pratishat
 Will it be easily agreed upon? iske alaava bhi kai sawaal bhi uth rahe hai
 The comments - amir or garib ke istemaal kii chizon par sarkarein alag-alag tex lagaati hai
 - This gap will disappear after the introduction of GST
 - aam aadmi ke istemaal kii chizon ke daam badhenge yaa ghatenge
 - What will happen to small industries and unorganized sector industries
 - abhi unhen excise duty main kai prakaar kii raahat milti he
 - Due to this exemption many industries have been able to stand
 - ab agar in par tex laga to kya ve bade udyogon kaa saamana kar paayenge
 What will happen if GST is imposed on millions of small industries and businesses
 2016 main lagu hua to shuruaati saal main iske jhanjhaton kaa bhi sarkaar ko andaaza to hoga hi
 In this case, i have neither a better understanding nor opinion
 akhabaaron or iconomic and polytical vikali main chape lekhon ko padhakar aapke liye ye sab taiyaar kiya he
 Will try to understand about the possibilities and apprehensions of GST in a simple way
 raajnneetik masale ko chhod dete hai kyonki iz ikval tu hone lagegaa
 Meaning, then the Congress used to say that the BJP is not going to implement and now the BJP is saying that the Congress is not allowing it to be implemented
 tab manmohan singh kehete the ki bijepi 2004 kii haar se ubar nahin pai he or ab jetali kehete hai ki congress 2014 kii haar se ubar nahin pai he
 In his tweet dated 3 May 2014, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said chidambaram kehete hai ki madhyapradesh or gujarat jiesti lagu hone nahin de rahe hai
 We are proud of it because it would be disastrous if implemented in the current form
 is twit main shivaraj singh chouhan gujarat ke bihalf par virodh karne kaa garv kar rahe hai jabaki teen maheenaa pehle farvari 2014 main gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par maujuuda pradhanmantri kaa twit he ki 'maine saaf kiya he ki bijepi ne kabhi jiesti kaa virodh nahin kiya he lekin bina mukammal iti dhaanche ke jiesti ko lagu karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 ' hamen nahin maaloom ki jiesti ke liye mukammal iti kaa dhaancha is ek saal main taiyaar hua he yaa nahin
 The Standing Committee had also made several major changes to the Congress made bill
 lekin congress bijepi ke pahalu par baat karne se pehle zaruri he ki ham or aap jiesti ke bare main samajhen
 GST has to be passed by a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha due to the Constitution amendment bill
 phir uske baad aadhe rajya bhi do tihaai bahumat se paas karenge tab jaakar jiesti lagu hoga
 The government aims to be implemented in 2016, but there are other steps to this goal
 jiesti ko oparation yani amal main laane ke liye
 
 
 - a GST Council will be formed, headed by the Union Finance Minister
 - sadasyon main kendriya vitt rajya mantri, rajyon ke vitt mantri honge
 - Any decision in the council will be made by three fourths of votes
 - jiesti council hi tay karegi ki jiesti tex rate kya hoga
 Excise duty, customs duty, sales tax, many types of sales, service tax, octroi, octroi and many other types of indirect taxes must be heard
 in karon ke madhyam se centre sarkaar or har rajya kii sarkaar apni kamai karti he
 Like recently several states including Delhi increased excise duty on petrol
 daam bad gaye
 For example, once a state reduced excise duty and gave relief in petrol prices
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki jiesti ke baad rajya is tarah se tex gata badha sakenge yaa nahin
 GST is explained in a slightly simpler way at the site of PRS Legislative Research according to which
 
 
 - daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki ab naanaa prakaar ke tex kii jagah ek tex lagegaa
 - But three types of this one tax are also being mentioned
 - centre jiesti, state jiesti or inter state jiesti
 Crude oil, high speed diesel, petrol, natural gas, alcohol, cigarettes are excluded from the GST list
 yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki jiesti vahaan nahin lagegaa jahaan koi chiz banati he balki sidhe vahiin lagegi jahaan wo bikati he
 Therefore, many states fear that with the introduction of GST their revenue will be reduced because the states where the goods are produced will not be taxed, this will reduce their earnings
 centre sarkaar ne isaki bharpai kaa vaada kiya he or ek pratishat kaa atirikt tex lagane kii baat kii he
 Even at the time of VAT, there was a claim of maximum tax collection and no black money
 aisa hua yaa nahin aap jaanate hi honge
 Now it is being said about GST that if there is a tax, the prices will be reduced in the whole country
 ab is bahes ko samajhane ke liye kuch takneekee baton kii tasviir dimag main banani hogi
 - Like you buy yarn before making cloth
 - ise kaccha maal kehete hai or is par tex lagata he
 - The value is added to the thread when the fabric is made from it
 - vailu judi to uske liye alag se tex laga
 - Wholesale and retail shopkeepers also have to pay tax
 alag-alag charan par tex lagane se kisi chiz kii keemat badhati jaati he, ise ham cascading effect kehete hai
 As the cards are piled up, in the same way, touching one, the rest also slowly starts falling and the speed of falling increases
 isi tarah se maujuuda kar pranali main itane charan par tex lagata he ki chizon kii keemat bad jaati he
 It is being claimed in GST that the cascading effect will be reduced
 yani chizon ke daam kam ho jaaenge
 Taxation of individual states will get rid of
 aapaki balle balle ho jaaegi
 GDP will increase and tax collection will increase i
e
 black money will decrease
 jiesti kii dar kya hogi
 Dreams can be pleasant about tax too
 lekin kitna tex lagegaa
 27 percent or 18 percent
 kya is par aasaani se sahmati ban jaaegi
 Apart from this, many questions are also arising
 tippaniyan - Governments levy different taxes on the use of the rich and poor
 - jiesti ke aane ke baad yah antar mit jayega
 - Price of things used by common man will increase or decrease
 - chote udyogon or asangathit kshetra ke udyogon kaa kya hoga
 - Right now they get many types of relief in excise duty
 - is chhot ke kaaran kai udyog khadey ho sake hai
 Now if they are taxed, will they be able to face big industries
 lakhon chote udyogon or kaarobaaron par jiesti laga to kya hoga
 If implemented in 2016, the government will have an idea of its problems in the initial year
 jo bhi he is maamle main meri koi na to behatar samaj he or na raay

e
 black money will decrease
 jiesti kii dar kya hogi
 Dreams can be pleasant about tax too
 lekin kitna tex lagegaa
 27 percent or 18 percent
 kya is par aasaani se sahmati ban jaaegi
 Apart from this, many questions are also arising
 tippaniyan - Governments levy different taxes on the use of the rich and poor
 - jiesti ke aane ke baad yah antar mit jayega
 - Price of things used by common man will increase or decrease
 - chote udyogon or asangathit kshetra ke udyogon kaa kya hoga
 - Right now they get many types of relief in excise duty
 - is chhot ke kaaran kai udyog khadey ho sake hai
 Now if they are taxed, will they be able to face big industries
 lakhon chote udyogon or kaarobaaron par jiesti laga to kya hoga
 If implemented in 2016, the government will have an idea of its problems in the initial year
 jo bhi he is maamle main meri koi na to behatar samaj he or na raay
 All these have been prepared for you by reading articles printed in newspapers and Economic and Political Weekly
 prayaas karenge saral tareeke se jiesti kii sambhaavnaaon or ashankaon ke bare main samajhane ke liye
 Applying tax at different stages increases the price of something, we call it cascading effect
 jaise taash ke pattey dher ho jate hai usee tarah se ek ko chune se baaki bhi dhire-dhire girane lagate hai or girane kii raftaar bad jaati he
 Similarly , tax is levied at such a stage in the current tax system that the price of things increases
 jiesti main daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki cascading effect kam ho jayega
 That is, the price of things will be reduced
 alag-alag rajyon kii chungi se chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 Your bat will be bat
 jidipi bad jaaegi or tex collection badhegaa yani kaala dhan kam hoga
 What will be the rate of GST? tex ko lekar bhi sapane suhane ho sakate hai
 But how much tax will be levied
 27 pratishat yaa 18 pratishat
 Will it be easily agreed upon? iske alaava bhi kai sawaal bhi uth rahe hai
 The comments - amir or garib ke istemaal kii chizon par sarkarein alag-alag tex lagaati hai
 - This gap will disappear after the introduction of GST
 - aam aadmi ke istemaal kii chizon ke daam badhenge yaa ghatenge
 - What will happen to small industries and unorganized sector industries
 - abhi unhen excise duty main kai prakaar kii raahat milti he
 - Due to this exemption many industries have been able to stand
 - ab agar in par tex laga to kya ve bade udyogon kaa saamana kar paayenge
 What will happen if GST is imposed on millions of small industries and businesses
 2016 main lagu hua to shuruaati saal main iske jhanjhaton kaa bhi sarkaar ko andaaza to hoga hi
 In this case, i have neither a better understanding nor opinion
 akhabaaron or iconomic and polytical vikali main chape lekhon ko padhakar aapke liye ye sab taiyaar kiya he
 Will try to understand about the possibilities and apprehensions of GST in a simple way

 monsoon kii aakhri barish or western disturbance ne punjab samet tamaam uttar bharat main jo barish kaa kahar barsaaya he
 While the rains in northern India have increased the concern of the farmers, there is a serious challenge before the Modi government moving towards the general elections
 mausam vibhaag or punjab sarkaar ne lagaataar ho rahi barish ke chalate 21 sitambar se hi punjab main red alert jari kar diya tha or krishi vaigyanikon kaa daawa he ki yah sitambar ke aakhri hafte main barish kaa kram jari rahata he to kisaanon kii paki pakaai dhan kii fasal barbaadi ke kagaar par pahunch jaaegi

 desh main dakshin-pashchim monsoonakhrispaidaavaar ke liye behad ahm rahata he
 While the onset of monsoon from June is very important for the sowing of kharif crops, the withdrawal of monsoon from August to September gives great relief to the farmers as well as paving the way for a big income from the kharif yield
 lekin monsoon ke vidaai adhik barish ke saath hoti he to ye barish kisaanon ke liye badi samasya banakar khadi ho jaati he
 GST, good monsoon, low inflation, the good day of the economy are eagerly waiting for the last four years along with good monsoon

 In such a situation, is the monsoon going to betray the Modi government when it is most in need of a balanced monsoon

 While the Modi government has promised to double farmers 'income by 2022 in 2014, the threat of a kharif crop hovering just before the elections can not only reduce farmers' income but also put them under debt burden

 aam aadmi party ke saansad bhagwant maan ke sansad parisar kaa video banane se sabhi saansad naaraaz hai
 The issue arose in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha today and all have demanded stern action against Mann
 sabhi netaaon kaa maananaa tha ki aisa video bananaa suraksha ke saath khilwaad karnaa he
 Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan, herself, is deeply offended by Mann's behavior
 sumitra mahajan ne kaha he kibhagwant maanake khilaaf karrwai to zarur hogi
 But what kind of action will be taken will be decided after talking to the leaders of all the parties
 is bich spikar ne bhagwant maan ko saman kiya or unke dwaara banaae gaye video par naaraazgi vyakt kii
 He told Mann that this action of yours is not forgivable
 haalanki bhagwant maan baar-baar yah safai dete rahe ki unhone suraksha main chook ke iraade se yah video nahin banaaya
 Rather, he created this video with the intention of educating people so that people can get to know how to go through the process to raise questions in zero time
 maan kaa to yah bhi kahana tha ki isamen kuch galat nahin habijepi, akali dalto raajnneetik kaarnon se ise mudda bana rahi hai
 Maan's video was condemned by all the parties
 As soon as the proceedings of the house started in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the leaders of all the parties demanded strict action against Mann, accusing Bhagwant Mann's video of compromising safety
 is mudde ko lekar donon sadanon main lagaataar hangaamaa hota rahaa
 Everyone said that the attack has been done in Parliament on December 13, 2001 and it is not right for the security of the campus premises to be uploaded on Facebook by making videos like this, it is like risking the security of all leaders and the country
 isliye bhagwant maan ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kerani chahie
 Due to this uproar, the proceedings of the House could not go on
 kuch saansadon ne to spikar ko yah shikaayat bhi kii he ki bhagwant maan sansad main sharaab pikar aate hai
 Now the speaker will decide next week in Bhagwant Mann's case that what kind of action should be taken against him

 inputah bhashaa Can anyone live in Delhi for just Rs 32 a day? In the affidavit filed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the new definition of poverty line has been set by the Planning Commission, that if a family of four spends more than Rs 3860 a month in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore or Chennai, then it Will not be considered poor
 chaar logon par 3860 rupee kaa matlab he ek aadmi par 32 rupee pratidin
 Similarly, according to the Planning Commission, if a person spends more than Rs 26 a day in rural areas, he will not be called poor
 use garibi rekha ke neeche rahane vaale logon ke liye chalane vaali sarkari yojana kaa laabh nahin milegaa
 Vegetable prices are on fire
 doodh ke daam lagaataar bad rahe hai
 Prices of food and drink are skyrocketing
 mahangaai ne aam aadmi kii qamar tod kar rakh di he
 But the Planning Commission argues that anyone who can spend 32 rupees a day will not be called poor
 chaliye jaanate hai ki yojana ayog ne supreme court main jo halafanama daayar kiya he usamen garibi kii paribhaasha kya di gai haih1
 In cities which cost 965 rupees per month
 yani shaharon main jo 32 rupye prati din kharch karte hai wo garib nahin he
 2
 gaanvon main jo 781 rupye prati maah kharch karte hai
 That is, those who spend Rs 26 per day in the villages are not poor
 3
 If a family of 4 people living in the metro spends 3860 per month
 wo garib nahin hai
 The Planning Commission changed the definition of poor and poverty
 ab is badali hui paribhaasha ke anusaar shaharon main 32 or gaanvon main 26 rupye kharch karne vaale log kalyankari yojanaon kaa laabh nahin uthaa sakate
 Referring to the Tendulkar Committee, the Planning Commission said that you are not poor if you spend Rs 5 every day on rice or wheat
 ab dekhie 5 rupee main aapako milegaa kya
 Rice in Delhi averages Rs 22 a kg and wheat costs Rs 12 on an average
 to 5 rupye main milegaa 136 gram chaaval (3 ru kaa) or 166 gram gehun (2 rupye)
 The Planning Commission says you are not poor
 agar har roj 1
 80 spent on vegetables
 ab dekhie 1
 Will you get 180 g potato or 90 g onion or 90 g tomato or 180 g gourd for 80 rupees? yojana ayog kahata he ki aap garib nahin hai
 If you can spend 1 rupee on pulses everyday
 ab jaraa dekhie 1 rupee main kitni daal milegi
 The average rate of pulses in Delhi is Rs 50 per kg
 yani 1 rupee main sirf 20 gram daal milegi
 The Planning Commission says
 aap garib nahin hai agar doodh par har roj 2
 It costs 30 rupees
 ab dekhie 2
 How much milk will be available for 30 rupees? doodh kii keemat he 27 rupee prati litre
 So 2
 30 rupee main sirf 85 mili doodh mil saktaa he
 The Planning Commission states
 aap garib nahin he agar alpiji par har maheene 112 rupye kharch karte hai
 Now, according to LPG rates in the black market, only about 2 kg of LPG can be found at Rs 112
 yojana ayog ne supreme court ko aankade to bataa diya
 But just think that in this rising inflation, one can spend 32 rupees a day
 jaraa sochie kya mahaj 3860 rupee main chaar logon kaa parivaar apni jindagi kaat saktaa he
 You will ask these questions to anyone except the Planning Commission, the answer will be life from data

 If my son did not say this, i probably would not have written these letters

 Chhannulal Mishra is deeply distressed by the neglect of the current governments of the Center and the state
 vah sunishchit nahin he ki is baar pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa prastaavak banenge yaa nahin
 Mishra was a proponent of BJP candidate Narendra Modi from Varanasi parliamentary seat in the 2014 elections and is one of the Navratnas appointed by the Prime Minister for the Swachh Bharat Mission
 mishra ne buudhvaar ko kaha he ki unki umr kaa varanasi main ab koi shastreey gayak nahin he, jo abhi bhi sangeet ke liye puri tarah samarpit he, lekin puraa jivan sangeet ke liye samarpit karne ke baavjood centre or rajya kii maujuuda sarkaron ne unhen vah sammaan nahin diya, jo unhen milanaa chahie tha
 Chhannulal Mishra (83) is one of the Navratnas appointed by Prime Minister Modi for the Swachh Bharat Mission
 unhen or varanasi ke logon ko ummid thi ki is baar unhen bharat ratna mil saktaa he, lekin jab puraskaron kii ghoshnaa hui to unka naam na to bharat ratna kii suchi main tha, or na padmavibhushan kii suchi main hi
 Chhannulal says with an emotional heart, "people feel that i deserve these awards, but i don't have any desire for those who don't give
 meri ek maatr ichha meraa sangeet or meraa gayan he
 i have a lion - 'ilahi koi tamanna nahin jaan, i have spent my whole life in my songs'
 "kiraanaa gharaane ke varanasi nivasee shastreey gayak ne kaha, "padmavibhushan to kam se kam milanaa chahie tha
 But i have never, nor will i ever ask anyone for awards
 kisi se kyon maanguun, maangana hoga to bhagwaan se maangenge
 My music, people's love is the prize for me
 "thumari gayak mishra ne kaha, "padmabhushan to mila he, tanga hua he
 What benefit are you getting from it
 railgadee main do tikat to miltaa nahin ki ek sahaayak ke saath kahin aa-ja sakuun is budhaape main
 Told the government, but nobody listened
 phir padmabhushan, padmavibhushan kaa kya matlab
 All i have to say is " ullekhneey he ki channulaal ko 2010 main tatkaaleen samprag sarkaar ne padmabhushan se nawaja tha
 He said, "delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit was very fond of music and appreciative
 us samay ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh bhi sangeet ke kadradaan the
 i sang in front of him in Delhi
 unhone padmabhushan kii anushansa kar di, or mil gaya
 It was nice
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne bhi yash bharti puraskaar diya tha
 i asked him to give pension to artists, Akhilesh started pension of 50,000 thousand rupees for all artists
 lekin nai sarkaar ai to pension bhi band ho gaya

 pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri uma ne baatcheet main kaha, ‘ham is pradesh main lagaataar teesri baar jitkar phir sarkaar banaaenge 
 'assembly elections are due in the state in November this year
 unhone kaha, ‘vidhansabha chunaav main lagaataar teesri baar jeetne ke liye hamaare paas kai kaaran hai
 These include good development work done by the BJP government of the state
 ’ek sawaal ke jawaab main uma ne kaha ki yah sahi he ki varsh 2008 ke pichley vidhansabha chunaav main vah bhaajapa ke saath nahin thim or unhone apni bhartiya janashakti party ke jariye alag chunaav ladaa tha, lekin ab unki bhaajapa main vaapasi ho gai he
 In the last assembly election, the BJP got six percent votes and now these votes will definitely go in favor of BJP
 unhone kaha ki unki apni soch he ki mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan apane dam par hi 230 main se 150 siten jeet sakate hai or bhaajash ke chah pratishat vot se bhaajapa yah chunaav aasaani se jeet jaaegi
 The BJP vice-president said that after her sister-in-law committed suicide in August 2009, she went through the worst phase of her life
 unke parivaar kii is ghatana ne unhen bada sadma pahunchaaya tathaa us samay ek baar to jaise bhagwaan se unka bharosa uth sa gaya tha
 She said that she was 48 years old at the time of this incident and by then her faith and trust in God was unshakable
 unhen is sthiti se ubarne or bhagwaan par vishwaas kaayam karne main lagbhag 18 maah kaa samay laga
 Uma said that her belief returned when she was in Gangotri and there she met a woman from Karnataka who was living in a cave
 usne unhen bataaya ki unki bhabhi kii maut ho gai he or apane peeche ek chota betaa evam beti chhod gai hai, jinaki dekhbhaal ab vah khud karti hai
 He said, 'the condition now is that for the children of my sister-in-law, i am her mother and i treat her like my child
 ’ The politics of Hindutva is once again in the politics of the country
 hindutv kii prayogshaala gujarat se nikalakar narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri bane to duusari ore desh ke sabase bade soobe kaa siem bhi hindutv kaa bada cheharaa he
 It is a person who sacrificed his power in the name of Hindutva at one time in the bjp's list
 ye shaks kalyaan singh hai, jinhone ram mandir ke liye satta hi nahin ganvaai, balki is maamle main sajaa paane vaale ve ekmaatr shaks hai
 This is the reason why Karsevak considers Kalyan Singh the real Hindu heart emperor of BJP
 kalyaan singh kaa janm 5 janvari 1932 ko uttar pradesh ke aligarh main hua tha
 He grew up in the lap of the Sangh
 bijepi ke kaddavar netaaon main shumaar hone vaale kalyaan singh maujuuda samay main rajasthan ke rajyapal hai
 He was once one of the biggest faces of the Ram Mandir movement
 unki pahachanakattarpanthi hindutvvaadior prakhar vaktaa kii thi
 The condition was that as soon as Kalyan Singh's name came up, people of Muslim society started shrinking their nose and eyebrow
 30 oktober 1990 ko jabamulaayam singh yadav upi ke mukhyamantrithe to unhone karsevakon par goli chalava di thi
 The administration was adopting a strict attitude with the kar sevaks
 aise main bijepi ne unka muqabla karne ke liye kalyaan singh ko aage kiya
 Kalyan Singh was the second leader in BJP after Atal Bihari Bajpayee whose people were eager to listen to his speeches
 kalyaan singh ugr tevar main bolte the, unki yahi adaa logon ko pasand aati
 Kalyan Singh brought the BJP to a stand in a year that the party formed a government in UP on its own in 1991
 kalyaan singh upi ke bijepi ke pehle mukhyamantri bane
 According to the charge sheet filed in the CBI, Kalyan Singh along with his colleagues visited Ayodhya and took an oath to build the Ram temple just after becoming Chief Minister
 kalyaan singh sarkaar ke ek saal bhi nahin gujarey the ki 6 disambar 1992 ko ayodhya main karsevakon ne vivaadit dhaancha gira diya
 While he had given an affidavit in the Supreme Court that as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, he would not allow any damage to the mosque
 iske baavjood 6 disambar 1992 ko vahi prashasan jo mulaayam ke daur main karsevakon ke saath sakhti barte tha, mookadarshak banakar tamaasha dekh rahaa tha
 The Babri Masjid was demolished publicly
 iske liye kalyaan singh ko jimmedaar mana gaya
 Kalyan Singh resigned as Chief Minister on December 6, 1992, taking moral responsibility for it
 lekin duusare din centre sarkaar ne upi kii bijepi sarkaar ko barkhaast kar diya
 Kalyan Singh said at the time that this government was formed in the name of Ram Mandir and its purpose was served
 aise main sarkaar ramamandir ke naam par qurbaan
 Kalyan Singh received a one-day sentence for the Babri Masjid being demolished in Ayodhya and not protecting it
 babari masjid dhwans kii jaanch ke liye bane librahan ayog ne tatkaaleen pradhanmantri veepi narsimha raav ko clin chit di lekin yojanabaddh, satta kaa durupyog, samarthan ke liye yuvaaon ko aakarshith karne, or aresas kaa rajya sarkaar main sidhe dakhal ke liye mukhyamantri kalyaan or unki sarkaar kii aalochana kii
 CBI has also filed a case against several leaders including Kalyan Singh
 bataa den ki 25 saal pehle ayodhya main jo bhi hua wo khullam-khulla hua
 Thousands occurred in the hands of kar sevaks
 ghatana ke dauraan manch par maujuud murali manohar joshi, ashok singhl, giriraaj kishor, vishnu hari daalamia, vinay katiyaar, uma bharti, sadhvi ritambhra or laalkrishna adwani ke saamne hua
 It was up to Kalyan Singh to stop him from saving the mosque
 bijepi kii aaj jo bhi siyasat hai vah ramamandir andolan kii dein he
 Kalyan Singh along with Lal Krishna Advani has played an important role for this
 isi ayodhya kii dein he ki aaj narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri hai
 When LK Advani took a rath yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya, Narendra Modi was his charioteer
 iske baad 2002 main godhra main train kii jo bogi jalaai gai usamen marane vaale bhi wo karsevak the, jo ayodhya se laut rahe the
 This was followed by a riot in Gujarat and the rise of Narendra Modi
 idhar kalyaan singh vakt ke saath gumnaam hote gaye lekin karsevakon ke liye aaj bhi wo hindu hryday samraat hai
 Because what they have done for Ram temple
 bijepi ke kisi netaa ne nahin karke dikhaaya he

 The Deputy Chief Minister said that he is ready for this even if there is an agreement outside the court
 lekin kanoon laakar mandir banane kaa vikalp bhi khulaa hi he
 'can't tell what happened in the meeting' When asked about the meeting of the Sangh, he said that BJP leaders do not have the right to speak about the meeting called by RSS

 At one point of time, he was silenced but later Bukkal Nawab clarified his statement that he was not against the mosque
 alpsankhyak morche kii kaarysmiti main hue vivaad ke baad alpsankhyak morcha ke mahaamantri iftikhar mahaamantri ne maamle ko samajhaate hue bataaya ki nawab jo baat kah rahe the use kuch sadasyon ne samajhane main galati kar di jisaki vajah se vivaad paidaa ho gaya
 It is noteworthy that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah has also reached Lucknow to participate in this meeting of the sangh-bjp

 They have said that we should wait for the final verdict of the court

 After Tuesday's meeting, BJP leader LK Advani and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi may be talking about a treaty, but Advani's special ally Sudheendra Kulkarni is pointing out something else
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main adwani for piem campan ke aguva rahe kulkarni ne ek khatnuma lekh main narendra modi ko ‘taanashaah’ bataaya he or party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko ‘lomadee si niyat vaala’
 Kulkarni has written that preparations are underway to crown a dictator
 is pher main ek adarsh loktantric netaa ko na sirf kinare kar diya gaya he, balki uskaa apmaan bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 Apparently, Kulkarni's gesture here is to make Narendra Modi the chairman of the BJP election campaign committee and to keep Advani aside in this order
 cash for vot maamle main jail ja chuke sudhindra yaheen nahin rukate
 He writes that a self-thinking leader, who has always despised the organization, whose own state mates have always been the victim of fret, has suddenly risen to strength
 bijepi kii rashtriya yojanaon kaa aguva ban gaya he
 While always sacrificing, thinking of others rather than themselves and creating a party for decades by brick-by-brick, the leader has been sidelined as if it were something of archaeological importance
 modi kii netritv kshamta par sawaal uthaate hue kulkarni kehete hai ki is baat kaa koi pramaan nahin he ki narendra modi apane hi rajya main sabko saath lekar chale hon
 So how can they be expected to handle the alliance? sangh par bhi saadhaa nishanaadwani prakaran main sangh kaa role bhi jagajaahir tha
 The Sangh was adamant and Modi's name was announced in Goa, keeping the displeasure of the elderly
 phir bujurg naaraaz hue, to sangh ne hi maamle ko sulataya
 In such a situation, the Advani camp is also upset with the Sangh
 kulkarni likhte hai ki duusari peedi ke netaaon ko aage karne ke naam par party khadaa karne waalon ko shaktiheen karne kaa khel sangh ne rachaa
 Kulkarni to Rajnath after Kharimodi and Sangh, Kulkarni did not spare the party chief either
 unhone kaha ki rajnath kisi jyotishi ke bataae bhulaave main hai ki ek din vah desh ke pradhanmantri banenge
 That is why he is running his political tricks
 bijepi main adwani kii jagah kamjor kar rahe hai
 At the end of the letter, Kulkarni writes that the bjp's decay has begun
 agar adwani ko isi tarah apamaanit kiya jaataa rahaa, baghawat yaa sanyas ke liye vivash kiya gaya, to party kaa khaatmaa or bhi teji se hoga
 Pakistani teenager Malala Yousafzai, who survived the Taliban attack, has now voiced opposition to 'circumcision' of women
 unhone britain main khatna se hone vaali mahila jananaang vikruti (female Genital Mutilation) ke khilaaf abhiyaan kaa samarthan kiya he
 Malala, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, has now joined the campaign with her teenage peers with the aim of spreading wider awareness in British schools on this issue with 'their global campaign for the right to education for every girl'
 malala ab birmingham main bas gai hai
 In an interview with 'guardian', Malala praised 17-year-old Fahima Mohammed's campaign and called for better education in schools over FGM
 malala ne kaha, ‘main fahima ke abhiyaan ke prayek charnon kon dekhati hum or main samajhati hum ki itani choti umr main ve kaaphi bada kaam kar rahi hai
 More than 14 crore girls and women are perverted
 lekin pakistan main jis tarah se ladakiyon ko shiksha se dur rakhaa jaataa he, aise main hamen agali peedi ke liye ek-duusare ke saath milakar or majbootee se in chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 i am like his sister and i am with him
 ’aakhir kya hota he khatna
 
 
 In circumcision, part of the clitoris of the genitals of women is cut off
 yani mahila ke jananaang kaa baahar rahane vaala sara hissaa kaat diya jaataa he
 Only the small gate is left for urination and menstruation
 khatna ke kaaran sambhog va bachche paidaa karne main baari takalif sambhav he
 Even someone can die from it
 aisi manyata he ki khatna kar die jane se sex ke prati mahilaon kii ruchi kam ho jaati he
 Women from East African countries living in England are also facing this practice
 yah ab england kii bhi pareshaani kaa sabab banataa ja rahaa he
 According to a report, around 20 thousand young women in Britain and France are going through the risk of FGM due to circumcision
 jammu-kashmir ke yuvaaon or desh ke baaki rajyon ke chaatro ke bich saamaajik-saanskrithik ekta ke maddenjar ek kaarykram kii yojana taiyaar kii he
 The Union Government and the Government of Jammu and Kashmir have reached a consensus agreement on Monday, under which youth from all over the country will be able to travel to understand the characteristics and circumstances of the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 jabaki kashmiri chaatr desh kii saanskrithik vivadhta se rubaru honge
 Under this program, a batch of Kashmiri students will leave for the capital Delhi on January 18 and will also participate in the Republic Day celebrations
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralayake adhikariyon ke mutabik desh bhar ke chaatro main aapasi meljol badhaane kaa ye kaarykram aage bhi jari rahegaa
 a senior official said that the aim is to create an environment in which the students of Jammu and Kashmir can meet the students of other states
 iske tahat kareeb 10 hajaar chaatr desh bhar kii yatra karenge
 This step is being taken at a time when the opposition's attack on the Modi government is intensified due to law and order and instability in Jammu and Kashmir
 shiksha se sudharenge halatkashmiri yuvaaon main baaki rajyon ke prati lagaav kaa vikaas karne ke liye isaki ruparekha taiyaar kii ja rahi he
 Vikas Swaroop, secretary in the HRD ministry, said, “our ministry is focusing on how the situation in Jammu and Kashmir can be normalized through education
 mantralay kii ek team ne rajya kaa daura kiya or is masale par JK ke rajyapal va mukhyamantri se charchaa kii he
 Now work is being started at the ground level
 ' The Supreme Court has given its verdict in the politically sensitive Ayodhya Verdict case
 supreme court ne aitihaasik faisla sunaate hue kaha kisemin kaa malikana haq 'ramalala virajman' ko diya jaae ormasjid ke liye ayodhya main kisi duusare sthaan par paanch acre jameen dijae
 Since this decision of the Supreme Court, reactions from all four sides have started coming
 yahaan tak ki bollywood kalakaaron ne supreme court ke faisle par apana riection diya he
 Recently, Farah Khan Ali (farah Khan Ali) daughter of famous Bollywood actor Sanjay Khan has also tweeted about the decision on Ayodhya case, which is becoming very viral on social media
 Happy with the Ayodhya Verdict
 Hopefully the temple will be built now & we can move on from divisive politics to focus on ALL our people and making our economy grow
 Less religious politics and more economic policies that benefit the nation at large
 Jai Hind Farah Khan Ali in his tweet has reacted to the decision of the Supreme Court on the Ayodhya case
 farah khan ali ne twit main likhaa, "ayodhya maamle par aae faisle se khush hum
 It is hoped that now the temple will be built and we will be able to move away from politics and focus on the people and move the economy forward
 dharmik raajnneeti kam hogi or aarthik nitiya badhengi jo bade paimaane par raashtra ko phayda pahunchaayengi

 Let me tell you that Farah Khan Ali, the daughter of Bollywood actor Sanjay Khan (farah Khan Ali), expresses her views on contemporary issues
 farah khan ali peshey se ek diziner hai, lekin vah soshal media par bhi khub active rahati hai
 At the same time, when talking about the Ayodhya case, the Supreme Court, while delivering the verdict, said that ownership cannot be given on the basis of faith and trust
 bataa den ki faisla padhate hue shuruyaat main hi supreme court ne shiya vakf board (shia Waqf Board) kii yachika khaarij kar di thi
 The court bench unanimously took this decision
 dilli police ne shaatir luteron ke ek gang kaa pardaafash kiya he
 Gang miscreants cleverly went missing their bikes and filed firs for their theft
 uske baad bina kisi dar ke apni usee bike se lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam dete
 Due to this, the police themselves did not suspect their involvement in the crime
 lekin antat lutere apane hi jaal main funs gaye
 Every time after committing robbery, he would leave the bike on the side of the road
 phir unamem se hi koi sadak ke kinare laavaaris bike kii soochna 100 nambar par police ko detaa or lutere apni bike shaan se police se waapas le aate
 But on 16 November, Kismet was not with the gang
 apni puri sajeesh ke tahat gang ke ek badmashmanjit ne apni bike chori kii exiaardarj kara di
 After this, three gang miscreants arrived at a mobile showroom in Khajuri area to carry out the robbery from the same bike

 college kii pehali garmiyon main maine sochaa ki yah pataa kiya jaae ki kya main apane kism kaa akelaa insaan hum? main khud chizon ko jaananaa chahta tha
 For this i started an anonymous sex survey
 isaki prerana mujhe college ke blog (esayssi shots) ke ‘‘canfeshans pej’’ (aatmasweekrutiyon kaa panna) se mili, jahaan ek joda alag ho gaya tha or ladki ne sori kehete hue ek post likhi thi
 Actually, he tied the boy's hand with handcuffs to the bed during sex
 ladki kaa kahana tha ki aisa karke use bahut majaa aayaa
 But all the fun was lost when he came to know that the handcuff key had been lost
 samasya zyada badi isliye ho gai kyonki ladke ko jor kii peshaab lagi thi or ladki ke maa-baap kuch der main ghar pahunchane vaale the
 In compulsion, the boy had to urinate in the bucket and after an hour and a half he got the key, when the parents were about to reach
 iske baad hi mere dimag main aise tamaam dussahasik sex karnaamon ko jutaney kaa khyaal aayaa
 Very objective questions were asked in the survey, but it also had a place to give details about its experiences
 masalan, ‘‘aap kitni baar hastmaithun karte hai’’ ke jawaab main ek ladke ne coment main likhaa, ‘‘ginata nahin hum
 "my friend Bhushan was the first person to tell me about his experience
" vah jab 14 saal kaa tha, tab uski bahan kii dost, jo usase umr main paanch saal badi thi, usne uske saath sex kii pahal kii thi
 Then it started happening very often
 vah ladakiyon ko aakarshith karne kii apni kala kaa shrey ab bhi is shuruaati anubhav ko hi detaa he
 (he is currently 21 years old and has had relationships with 12 girls)
 mere ek sahpaathee prashanth ne bataaya ki kaise usne ek baar 24 ghante main 10 baar sex kiya tha
 Another classmate, Jacob, said that he does not masturbate when he is having an affair with a girl because he considers it cheating on him
 haa, jab vah akelaa hota he, tab din main teen baar hastmaithun karata he
 Tina told me how she tried to masturbate, but failed because "she didn't know what to do
" ’’uski sabase acchhee saheli ne bataaya ki climex par pahunchane main use kabhi-kabhaar poun ghanta yaa usase zyada vakt lag jaataa he
 Maybe this is the reason why a girl wrote in response to "how do you feel after masturbating", "never satisfied
" ’’ jabaki duusari ne likhaa, ‘‘thakaan
 "it makes sense why 29 of the 48 girls surveyed said they had never tried masturbation
" sabhi haalanki itane khule hue nahin the
 Some refused to respond politely and others thought me clingy
 anu ne shit bharne se manaa kar diya kyonki use is bare main sochakar hi shame aati thi
 Arjuna first denied it
 phir taiyaar hua or teen din baad survey bharkar de diya
 Some directly said that it should not make sense to me
 is survey ne steffens ke chaatro ko apane sex jivan ke bare main aapas main samvaad karne kaa ek rasta muhaiyaa karaayaa
 Some questions were about how open he is to his parents
 mujhe yah jaanakar hairat hui ki sirf 10 fisadi ladke-ladkiyaan apane mata-pita se hastmaithun kii baat karte hai
 Most worked on the policy that "don't ask, don't tell"
 mujhe yah jaanakar hairat hui ki 37 fisadi ladke apane rishton ke bare main abhibhavakon se baat karte hai or ‘‘donon ko bataate hai
 "only 25 per cent of girls believe in both mother and father and 18 per cent are open to their mother
" yah jaananaa dilachasp tha ki mere college main hastmaithun shuru karne kii ladakon kii ausat umr 14 saal thi, jabaki ladakiyon ke liye 16 saal thi
 In addition, only one of the 35 boys surveyed said that he had never masturbated
 maine paaya ki kareeb 50 fisadi ladakon ko hastmaithun ke baad ‘‘santushti’’ milti he, jabaki ladakiyon main aisa mahasoos karne vaali sirf ek tihaai thim
 The second most popular answer on this issue from girls (14 per cent) was that "like i have wasted time
" ’’ab sawaal uthta he ki is sex survey ko karne ke baad kya haal he
 Questions about sex life gave us the opportunity to transcend many taboo
 ham hansate, latife banaate or gambhir baaten bhi karte the
 i even asked my Professor of Philosophy what his sex life is, to which he replied that sex is a boring and repetitive work and "he prefers to sleep instead"
 ’’survey se maine janaa ki sex ek anaavashyak boj or varjana he, jise ham apane sanvaadon main dhote rahete hai
 Especially in the context of people of the opposite sex
 bas ek choti-si koshish, kuch sawaalon or hansi kii jarurat he, jisase aap sex naam ke is rakshas ko hameshaa ke liye khatm kar sakate hai

 ' notebandi par beete ek saal se jari bahes main ek bhram haaavee he ki iskaa sidhaa asar arthvyavastha main maujuud blikemani par padegaa
 This has led to big claims of surgical strikes against black money being thrown out of the economy, crushing the parallel economy and money laundering

 What is the government saying? After announcing demonetisation on 8 November 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken on 5 different occasions in November itself, while enumerating the purpose of demonetisation
 8 november 2016 ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha tha ki unki sarkaar desh se bhrashtachar or kaledhan ko jad se khatm karne ke liye 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency ko band kar rahi he
 The government argued that the anti-national and anti-social elements had started using this currency
 notebandi par apane pehle bayaan ke ek hafte baad 13 november, 2016 ko pradhanmantri ne phir notebandi par kaha- mujhe kaledhan or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladane ke liye chunaa gaya or main vahi kar rahaa hum
 a week later, the Prime Minister said on 22 November 2016 that demonetisation is the first and not the last battle against corruption and black money
 phir 25 november, 2016 ko pradhanmantri ne kaha ki unhone garib or madhyam varg ke hiton kii raksha karne ke liye notebandi kaa faisla liya
 According to PM Modi, people were forced to give bribe while buying school, hospital and land and after this decision, this poor person will not have this constraint because no one will be ready to take bribe from them
 phir isi maheene ke ant main 27 november ko pradhanmantri ne kaha ki pehle kalaadhan jamaa kar rakhane vaale log notebandi ke baad use vyavastha main waapas laane ke liye garib aadmi kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 What is the theory of economy saying? Demonetisation shot into the leg of the country's fast running economy
 jane maane arthshaastri or upie kaarykaal main neshnal adwijuri council ke sadsy rahe zyaan drez ne notebandi kii tulana karte hue kaha tha ki yah kaam thik usee tarah he jaise ek tej raftaar se bhaagti racing car ke pahie par kisi ne goli maar di ho
 Zyan Drez claimed that this decision of the government has been taken only to eliminate the black money held by the opposing political parties
 ise bhi padhein: modi sarkaar ko cash se dikkat lekin japan main top gear par he cash iconomizyaan drez ne daleel di ki kalaadhan rakhane vaala dhoort vyakti apni kaali kamai ke cash ko suutakes main bharkar rakhane se behatar tareeke jaanata he
 He spends his black earnings, invests and converts the cash into another form
 vah sampatti kharid letaa he, mahangi shaadiyon par uda detaa he, dubai main shopping karata he yaa netaaon ko khush karne ke liye kharch kar detaa he
 However, it is also true that at any given time, some black money may have been lying in the kitchen compartment or pillow shell
 lekin is bache-khuche kaledhan ko baahar nikaalane kii kavayad kuch usee tarah he ki aap kamare main shower chalaakar pochha lagaaein
 Hence, calling this move a surgical strike against black money is merely an illusion
 vahiin zyaan drez ne kaha tha ki kaledhan kaa sanchay karne kaa kaam sambhavat: raajnneetik dal karte hai
 It is logical for them to collect large amounts of cash so that the election campaign can be made easier
 lihaaja, vipakshi dal notebandi ke pramukh torget the
 In the economic data, after the demonetisation exercise that lasted for months, the Reserve Bank recently revealed that almost the entire restricted currency has been deposited with it
 is khulaase se zyaan drez kaa aarthik siddhant ek baar phir surkhiyon main aa gaya
 At the same time, the manner in which the Union Ministers including the Prime Minister extended the purpose of demonetisation from time to time, it is clear that the first argument given on 8 November from demonetisation has been proved wrong
 isiilie notebandi ke ek maheene ke andar 22 november ko kahana padaa ki kaledhan ke khilaaf ladaai main yah sirf pehla kadam he
 But the wonder is that when the dominance of demonetisation and its objective confusion has broken, then why the government does not believe that its decision was wrong

 And the crisis of the Congress is that if this gathering hoists the flag of its solidarity among the people, then it will shrink the market of buyers of both its politics and thinking

 To promote clean energy in the country's capital, the Kejriwal government has made preparations to buy solar power
 dilli sarkaar ne ek hajaar megawatt solar energy kharidne ke liye teenon diskam yani bijli companiyon se sahmati bana lee he
 Under this scheme, the tender process will be started in three months with the help of the central government

 This is the reason that Delhi's residential areas will be made aware for the use of solar power

 The rate of solar power is expected to be less than Rs 3 per unit

 According to Jain, the rate of solar energy in Delhi is around five rupees 50 paise
 iske istemaal par dilliwaalon ko do rupee tak kisbsidibhi di jaaegi
 Along with this, the government has also made a plan to give subsidy to farmers for installing solar pumps in Delhi
 iske alaava solar power ke liye rihaayshi ilaakon main paanch kilo wat tak ke bill par cormcial charge nahin liya jayega
 The government says that solar energy was discussed with power companies for the last six months

 Satyendra Jain informed that a pre-paid meter for tenants will be launched within three months

 haalanki sharad pavaar ne kaha ki yah mulaakaat sirf desh main krishi utpaadan ko badhaava dene ke mudde par hui thi
 He also said that he had met chief ministers of several states in this connection
 pavaar ne odisha ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak, pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee or madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan se hui mulaakaat kii baat bhi kahi
 Pawar made it clear during a ceremony held at a stadium in Thane on Saturday that he had gone to Gujarat and also met Narendra Modi
 pavaar apratyaksh taur par haal main media kii un khabaron ke bare main kah rahe the, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki 17 janvari ko nai dilli main unhone gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke saath 'gupt' baithak kii
 Pawar said, "as Union Agriculture Minister, i have the responsibility of increasing food production in the country and the implementation of Food Security Act and for this reason i have to visit many states
" pashchim bengal ke daure ke dauraan mukhyamantri mamata banerjee se mila
 Similarly, he met Naveen Patnaik in Odisha, Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Madhya Pradesh and when he went to Ahmedabad, he met Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha, haalanki achaanak ek din modi se meri mulaakaat ke bare main khabar prakashit hui
 What's wrong with meeting chief ministers? apana kaarobaar khadaa karne or kaarobaari netritv kaa khwab dekhne vaale lakhon chaatro ke liye management kii shiksha hasil karnaa garv kii baat hoti he
 This thing also inspired 30-year-old Akanksha Sethi to pursue a Masters in Business Administration
 ve apane saat saal patrakarita main bitaa chuki thim
 She says, "I always had academic instincts and wanted to study further
 main jab 30 saal kii hui to mere mata-pita meri shaadi kar dena chaahate the lekin main apana kariyar bananaa chaahati thi or do saal emb main bitaane kaa bhi koi matlab nahin banataa tha
 Then i decided to enroll in the one-year course at the Indian School of Business (ISB, Hyderabad)
 ”emb ke paathyakram mote taur par chaatro kii gyanatmak kshamtaaon ko behatar banane ke uddeshy se banaae jate hai
 In almost every major business school, there is only one way of admission, passing the CAT examination and special knowledge of mathematics and science is examined in it
 sethi kaa udhaaharan bataata he ki bijness skulon kii tasviir dhire-dhire kaise badal rahi he, jahaan paramparaagat rup se ejineering yaa finance kii prishthbhumi vaale chaatro ko hi tarjeeh di jaati rahi he
 After a career in journalism, Sethi obtained a degree in Forest Management and got a different qualification
 aaj bijness skool or bhartiyon karne vaale afasar darasal aise hi vividh kaushal vaale karmchaariyon kii talash main hai
 Their efforts are that people coming from different fields and experiences get more and more opportunities

 Such companies normally keep engineers with them

 “today, if you want, you can do MBA from any institute of your choice by spending few lakh rupees or few thousand rupees
 main internet se bhi yah degree hasil kar sakate hai, lekin yaad rakhen ki kisi institute kii vishwasaneeyata vahaan maujuud faikalti, uske paathyakram or placement record jaisi chizon par nirbhar karti he
 Companies are competing to keep students from the best business schools, because they have their own experience that students coming from the top institutes are relatively more prepared to deal with real life problems
 is saal india today group or emdiare ke bharat ke 269 best bijness skulon ke survey main yah baat saamne ai he ki philhal bijness management kii padhai karne kaa yah sabase acha mauka he, khaas taur par agar aap kisi badhibia bijness skool main daakhila le len
 Change is a truth that never changes, but there are some institutes that retain their place in the rankings year after year
 indian institute of management-ahmedabad (iiem-e) ek baar phir desh kaa best management institute banakar ubhara he
 Since 2003, this institute has consistently stood at the first position
 kuch aise institute hai jo apni ranking main lagaataar sudhaar kar rahe hai
 One of them is SP Jain Institute of Management and Research, Mumbai, which has moved up one place to fourth position in 2015 as compared to last year
 yah institute 2013 main saatven sthaan par tha
 Similarly, Management Development Institute of Gurgaon is at number five this time, while it was sixth in 2014 and eighth in 2013
 kuch pratishthit santhaan is suchi se isliye chhot gaye hai kyonki unhone yaa to survey main hissaa nahin liya (iiem bangaluru or iiem lakhanu) yaa phir apane aankade samay rahete jamaa nahin kiye
 a similar thing has been found in the top institutes that the performance of all these are increasing in terms of campus placements
 paramparaagat niyoktaaon jaise banking or vittiya kshetra or kansalting ke alaava survey main paaya gaya he ki na sirf finance, privet equity or venture capital fermein bijness skulon se chaatro ko le rahi hai balki ab internet or i-commers tathaa technology companiyaan bhi in institute kaa rukh kar rahi hai
 This time in the last round of placements in top B-schools, Flipkart, Amazon, Olacabs, Quikr, Snapdeal and Uber were the key employers who paid 25 per cent more than traditional employers
 iske alaava prayek kshetra main kaam or bhoomikaaon kaa bhi vistaar hua he
 For example, in addition to the old roles in the Internet and e-commerce such as product managers, category managers and account managers, new avenues have also opened up for digital marketing, data analysis, operations and supply chains
 sansthaanon se is baar nikalne vaale chaatro ko motaa vetan mila he

 This course is conducted jointly by Vedika Foundation and Sri Aurobindo Center for Arts and Communication

 There has also been a change from the perspective of appointments

 ”bijness skulon main chaatr ab nae daur ke kshetron ko zyada se zyada chun rahe hai jahaan acha vetan miltaa he
 In such a situation, traditional fields will have to find new avenues and ways to attract candidates and retain their talents
 exis bank ek aisa program chalaata he jisamen nae rangaruton ko institute ke sheersh karmchaariyon ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 For this, there is a rotation system in which new employees are engaged in different tasks in turn
 bank ne mid level leadership main mahilaon ko bhoomika dene ke liye iesabi ke saath gathjod kiya he
 The rate of placements in many schools in 2013-15 batch reached a record level due to the demand for placements in new-age areas over traditional areas
 masalan, iiem-kolkata main placement kii prakriya dhai din main hi nibat gai jabaki saamanytah isamen ek hakrata lagata he
 The placement of all the students in MDI was done in three days and the condition was that 60 companies were still left with no students left to keep

 (along with E
 kumaar sharma) My favorite definition of all definitions of a leader is that of American futurologist Joel Barker
 ve kehete hai ki netaa vah shaks hota he jiske peeche anya log us jagah pahunchane ke liye chalate hai jahaan ve apane aap nahin pahunch sakate
 The emphasis on 'choosing to follow' in this definition automatically dismisses the distorted, oppressive nature of leadership
 iske atirikt, paribhaasha kaa ek aashay yah bhi he ki netaa vah ho jiske paas vilakshan najariya ho: vah najariya jo logon ko unki vaazib jagah par le jane main sakasham ho
 The failure of most of India's leaders is the inability to form, implement and live with a relevant vision for India
 ve aise kisi kaam se darate hai kyonki vilakshan nazariye ke liye saahas, sankalp or vyaktigat tyaag kii jarurat padati he
 At the moment, in the case of all of us it seems that the steps taken without any thought are proving effective in our case
 isse zyada kuch bhi karne ke liye bhavishya kii soch or khud se upar uthne kii darkaar hoti he
 What is worrying about this? The immediate answer is: India is in danger
 bharat ko spapndrashtaa netaa chahie
 When the country is gearing up for the Modi vs Rahul match, we need to ask ourselves the question, which of these two is the biggest dreamer? And who will give us real results? The view of any leader is completely his personal thing
 kya rahul gandhi kaa bharat ko lekar koi nijee najariya he? kya unhen aisa lagata he ki bharat ko uske logon kii najar main ahmiyat dilaane or duniya ke liye praasangik banane ke liye kuch buniyadi kaam kiya janaa he? agar aisa koi najariya unke paas he, to unhen ise aakaar dena chahie
 Narendra Modi's view of the recent wave of electoral victories in the state is more understandable, though his scope is non-scientific
 rajya ko chalaanaa or bharat ko chalaanaa do nihaayat alahada baaten hai
 In the last couple of years, anyone who has come through Gujarat has returned diving in appreciation of their committed governance and economic progress
 lekin is saraahna par gaharaa saaya mandara rahaa he
 Modi's ability to get things done is actually a dictatorial trend
 iske baad jab aap sampradayik hinsa ke shikaar purushon, mahilaon or bacchon kii awaajen sunate hai, to jaahir taur par isaki chaaya or gahari tathaa ghanghor ho jaati he
 In Modi's journey to Delhi, one has to apologize to the nation
 modi ke liye bharat ke prati drushti ko samaveshi hona hoga
 There is only one strip of saffron in the tricolor and it does not mean any religion, Modi has to remember this
 jo bhi najariya ho, vah spasht or saahsee hona chahie
 People like climbing mountains, not termites
 rahul gandhi desh ko koun se pahaad par chadhaanaa chaahate hai, ab tak koi nahin jaanata
 Right now they are in front of us as a person who is cooking, which is yet to be revealed
 lekin yaheen ek sawaal bhi khadaa hota he: kya ve anicchhuk netaa banane ja rahe hai? swapndrashtaa netaa anmana nahin ho saktaa
 This reluctance of Rahul Gandhi comes out in many ways
 satta ke dar, satta ke jehar vaali unki haalia baatcheet vastav main eemaandaaree se kahi gai thi, lekin ab darane se hoga bhi kya
 It's too late bharat main nattejey dena duniya kaa sabase mushkil kaam he
 Here there is a need to be comfortable with the idea of power
 bharat ke sandarbh main praasangik nazariye kii jarurat abhootpurv aitihaasik anivaaryta ban chuki he
 There has never been such a situation before
 ek ore rajya vifal ho rahaa he or duusare chor par hamaara samaaj darakta or bikharata ja rahaa he
 They are our civilizational values and culture, with the help of which society has kept things tied to all the ups and downs
 hamaari ek samuhik naitikta or moolyabodh he jo aapasi bhaichaare or sanyam ko banaae rakhti he
 Our society has not been a society of plunder of winners, but today it is clearly visible that we are standing at the crossroads and have raised a question like a ghost: what is the meaning of being an Indian? a leader who aspires to run the country This question has to be answered
 iskaa jawaab vichaaron kaa ghalmail nahin ho saktaa, na hi salaahkaaron ke chapalusee bhare muhaavaron se kaam chalane vaala he
 Only FDI and NREGA is not the answer
 iskaa jawaab bheetar se aana hoga
 It has to be so ambitious and inspiring that it can take this republic forward and drag society from the margins to the center
 samaaj dhah gaya to rajya tantra nahin batch paaegaa
 The identity of leadership is to have a great vision, but the question is how to decide whether that vision is right or not? No one can answer this
 sirf swapndrushtaa jaanata he ki uskaa sahi vakt kab aayega kyonki uddeshy kii ekta uske bheetar hi samahit he
 At that moment, power is not destructive, it does not hurt its carrier but is willing to surrender to the cause of the larger cause
 najariya agar logon ko jod saktaa he to baant bhi saktaa he
 Leaders also come from among the common people and they are also afraid that their depths should not be measured in front
 netritv apane saath antarnihit jokhim lekar aata he
 This is a game whose results cannot be guaranteed

 aam aadmi party main bhitari kalah apane ufaan par he
 The party's Okhla MLA and member of the political affairs committee of the party, Amanatullah Khan, has opened a front against senior party leader Kumar Vishwas, alleging that he wants to break and usurp the party
 tippaniyan Amanatullah Khan issued a statement to the media saying that "kumar Vishwas Ji wants to usurp and break Aam Aadmi Party"
 wo apane ghar vidhayakon ko bulaakar bulaakar ye kah rahe hai ki mujhe party kaa sanyojak banawaao nahin to bijepi main chalo, bijepi har ek ko 30 karod dene ke liye taiyaar he, aisa hi yogendra yadav ji chaahate the
 i think all this is happening at the behest of BJP
 is kaam ke liye inhone 4 vidhayak chode hue hai
 It is the job of these four mlas to take the mlas to Kumar ji's house, 10 mlas told me this
 shanivaar ko ek mantri ke yahaan chaaron vidhayakon kii meeting bhi hui
 ' aapako bataa den ki isse pehle keval ye atakalein lag rahi thim ki kya arvind kejariwal party ke rashtriya sanyojak ke pad se hat sakate hai or kumaar vishwaas party ke sanyojak kaa pad sambhaal sakate hai
 But a direct and major attack on AAP MLA k Kumar Vishwas is likely to increase discord within the party
 amanatullah khan ne media ko bayaan jari kar kaha ki "kumaar vishvas ji aam aadmi party ko hadapna chaahate hai or todna chaahate hai
 He is calling the mlas in his house and saying that, make me a party convenor or else go to BJP, BJP is ready to give 30 crores to each one, Yogendra Yadav wanted it
 mujhe lagata he ye sab bijepi ke ishaare par ho rahaa he
 They have left 4 mlas for this work
 in chaaron vidhayakon kaa ye kaam he ki wo vidhayakon ko kumaar ji ke ghar le jate hai, aisa mujhase 10 vidhayakon ne bataaya
 On Saturday, a minister's meeting of the four mlas was also held
 ' Let me tell you that earlier there was only speculation whether Arvind Kejriwal could step down as the party's national convenor and Kumar Vishwas could take over as the party's convenor
 lekin aap vidhayak ke kumaar vishwaas par sidhe or bade hamale se party ke bheetar kalah or badhane kii sambhaavna he

 Today is Sardar's day
 janmdin he
 Our chief has become the tallest in the world
 janmdin par sardaar ko ek nai sohabat mili he
 High statues of the world have been found
 ab unki tulana jin pratimaaon se hogi unamem unki pratimaa nahin he, jinke saath or jinke peeche sardaar sardaar bane rahe
 Meaning, apart from Sardar Gandhi and Nehru, these statues are also shining brightly
 faqat 3000 karod se hi sardaar patel kii pratimaa duniya main sabase oonchi ho gai
 Don't be sorry to hear 3000 crores
 sochen ki aapane skool college yaa aspataal ke liye kab sangharsh kiya
 When demanded the library
 haa aap kah sakate hai ki jab upi main mayawati, foole, shahu, ambedkar kii pratimaayein laga rahi thim tab unka virodh kyon hua tha
 Then there were allegations of corruption, whose investigation is not known till date, but during that time the statues made by Mayawati were mocked a lot
 kaha gaya ki aspataal chahie murti nahin
 So don't be sorry
 koi kuch nahin bolegaa
 Neither Zamana will speak nor Zamir will speak

 Sardar Patel has been a stronghold in a section of India's politics as a repressed will
 nehru banaam patel kii pratispardhaa ke bagair na nehru kii baat ho paa rahi he na patel kii
 a large section kept thinking that if Patel were the Prime Minister
 jabaki patel ne kabhi nahin kaha ki yadi ve pradhanmantri hote
 He called himself a soldier of Gandhi
 nehru ko apana netaa maanate the
 Without Gandhi and Nehru's pictures on the Statue of Unity website, Sardar's world has grown big, but has become lonely as well
 aap kah sakate hai ki nehru ke naam par bane smarakon main kya sardaar kii pratimaa he
 This question is also correct
 aap khud bhi pradhanmantri ke bhaashan sune
 He very easily integrated Sardar's contributions to his government's plans in his speech
 iske baad bhi pradhanmantri ne kaha ki sardaar kii pratimaa ko lekar raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 His own speech is full of politics or really non-political speech, you have to decide
 darasal sardaar patel ke viraasat ke saath yahi badi ninsaphi he ki unki baat hameshaa nehru ke sandarbh main hoti he, jabaki unka jivan gandhi ke sandarbh main tha
 He never claimed the prime minister's post, nor did the factionalism for the post of Congress president
 ek baar jab vakaalat chhod di, aisho aaraam chhod diya to jivan bhar ke liye chhod diya
 Both Nehru and Patel were aware of what kind of discussion they had
 disambar 1950 main doctoron ke kehane par patel ko dilli chhodana pad rahaa tha
 Before leaving Patel told MV Gadgil that i will not live anymore
 mujhase ek vaada karo
 Gadgil said yes, then Patel took his hand in his hand and said that there should be as many differences as you have with Panditji, but do not leave him
 ye the sardaar patel
 Rajmohan Gandhi has written this passage on page number 532 in Patel's biography
 2 aktubar 1950 ko kaha tha ki jawaharlal nehru hi hamaare netaa hai
 Bapu has appointed him as his successor
 or isaki ghoshnaa bhi unhone kii he
 It is the duty of all the soldiers of Bapu to follow the orders of Jawaharlal ji
 main bevafa sipaahi nahin hum
 i never thought about the place i am
 main to itnaa jaanata hum ki mujhe jahaan rakhaa tha main waha hum
 Why did Sardar Patel tell Gadgil while leaving Delhi, promise not to leave Jawahar alone
 donon ke bich thos matbhed the magar aapasi sammaan bhi thos tha
 Maniben Patel was Sardar's daughter
 dahyabhai patel vallabhbhai patel unke bete the
 After the death of Sardar Patel, Dahyabhai Patel won the Lok Sabha elections in 1957 and 1962 on a Congress ticket
 maniben congress ke tikat par 1952 or 1957 main loksabhaa ke liye chuni gayi or phir rajyasabha bhi gayi
 Maniben opposed the Emergency and then won the election from Mehsana in 1977 on a Janata Party ticket

 Today is the death anniversary of Indira Gandhi
 isi din indira gandhi kii hatya hui thi or uske baad sikhon ke saath narsanhaar hua tha
 It is a strange match
 kahin sardaar ko bada kiya ja rahaa he to kahin indira ko
 It is being written in the competition that Indira too broke Pakistan into two
 america ke aage nahin jhukin
 Prime Minister Modi has paid tribute to him through a tweet
 unke twit main 84 ke dangon kaa koi zikr nahin he
 Ideally both sides should have remembered the Sikhs who were killed
 isse hamaare raajnneeti badi banati na ki choti ho jaati
 It would have been nice had Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi also remembered the Sikhs who were killed in the carnage, to keep politics away from violence even today, it would have been known how well our leaders think about violence later
 in tasveeron main aap rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ke alaava anya congressi netaaon ko dekh rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi has remembered Indira Gandhi personally and also as a politician
 congress par aarope lagata he ki usne patel kii viraasat ko kabhi aage nahin kiya
 Congress should think about where the opportunity to accuse him came from
 aisa nahin he ki patel ke naam par santhaan, airport, aspataal, yaa nagar nahin hai
 Still, the answer has to be given to the Congress as to why it remained uneasy about Patel
 pichley chaar saal main congress ke netaa or kaaryakarta nehru par hone vaale anaap shanaap hamalon kaa bhi bachaav nahin kar paae
 What will Patel defend? rahul gandhi ne twit kiya he ki sardaar patel rashtrabhakt the jinhone azaadi, ekta or secular bharat kii ladaai ladi
 Steele's intended chieftain was full of compassion, a heartfelt Congressman who never tolerated fanaticism or communalism
 unki janmashati par bharat ke is mahaan sapoot ko salaam karata hum
 With this, another tweet from Rahul is that it is also ironic that the statue of Sardar Patel is being unveiled, but the institutions he built are all being demolished
 bharat kii sansthaaon kaa vyavasthit rup se khandit kiya janaa deshdoh se kam nahin he
 The image of unity has been created, but today there is a need for Sardar
 jab hamaari raajnneeti hindu hone yaa na hone, asli hindu hone yaa nakli hindu hone kii bahes main chali jaae to yahi vakt he apane bheetar us sardaar ko khojane kaa jo kahin gum ho gaye hai
 Who were against communalism like iron
 1941 main jab ahmedabad main dange bhadak uthe tab sardaar patel ne kaha tha aapako ekaek yah kya soojha ki aap ek-duusare ke gale kaatane lage
 i am sad that our father left
 ahmedabad shahar ke naam par kalank lag gaya
 How to delete it
 ise mitaane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham is baat kii koshish karen ki dubaara is shahar main aisa vaataavaran paidaa na ho
 In 2002, Ahmadabad was again stained
 kya aaj ke din 84 or 2002 ke dangon ke prati sabhi ko praayshchit nahin karnaa chahie tha
 When Gandhi was assassinated, it was Patel
 unhone tab aresas par pratibandh lagaaya
 Rather, citing information under his ministry, it was clear that the people of the Sangh had distributed sweets after the murder
 11 sitambar 1948 ko patel se aresas ke sarasanghachaalak em es golwalkar ko patr likhaa tha ki hinduon ko sangathit karnaa or unki sahaayta karnaa ek baat he, lekin apni takalifon ke liye besahaara or maasoom purushon, auraton or bacchon se badla lenaa bilkul duusari baat
 Apart from this, it was also that his Congress opposition, that too with the strictness that neither the care of personality, nor of civilization, nor of civility, created a kind of uneasiness in the public
 inke saare bhaashan sampradayik vish se bhare the
 It was not necessary to instill enthusiasm among the Hindus and to manage their defense that poison spread
 is zehar kaa fal ant main yahi hua ki gandhi ji kii amuly jaan kii qurbaani desh ko sahani padi
 The entire sympathy of the government and people was not with the RSS, but against them
 gandhi ji kii mrityu par aresas waalon ne jo harsh prakat kiya or mithai banti, usase yah virodh or bhi bad gaya
 In these circumstances, there was no other way for the government to take steps against the RSS
 is pratimaa ko lekar sardaar sarovar baandh ke aas paas ke gaanv ke logon ne sawaal uthaae hai
 People from 72 villages said that they would observe a fast in protest against the unveiling of the statue on 31 October
 chulhaa band rahegaa
 The heads of 22 villages have written a letter to the Prime Minister that the forests, rivers, waterfalls, fields here have taken care of us for centuries
 ham inhen ke aasare jite rahe hai, lekin ab sab nasht kiya ja rahaa he
 Don't you think it's like celebrating someone's death
 hamen to aisa hi lagata he
 We villagers want to say with great sadness that we will not welcome you on 31 October
 aap bin bulaae mehmaan kii tarah aaenge to ham aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If Sardar Patel had seen how natural resources are being destroyed, injustice is being done to us, he would have cried
 jab ham apni awaz uthaa rahe hai, aapaki police karrwai kar rahi he
 Why are you not ready to listen to our problems? lekin pradhanmantri ne kaha he ki is pratimaa ke kaaran aas paas ke adivasee logon ko rojgaar milegaa
 The Prime Minister also said that such a unity nursery should be built here so that the tourist coming here should take the plant of unity to his home and sow comments
 ab imtahaan aapkaa he, aap yani janata kaa
 Has become a tourist spot
 isliye yah spot muft nahin he
 You also should not feel that you are visiting Sardar for free, so there is a system of online tickets
 do prakaar ke tikat hai
 3-year-olds will not get tickets
 Observation Deck view, Valley of Flower, Memorial, Museum & Audio Visual Gallery, SOU site, Sardar Sarovar Dam dekhne ke liye 350 rupee ke tikat lagenge
 If you do not want to go to Observation Deck view, then there is a separate package for that
 praudh logon ko 60 rupee kaa tikat lagegaa or bacchon ko 60 rupee
 The bus charge is 30 rupees
 tikat ke maamle main bhi sardaar kii pratimaa bharat ke kai mehalon, kilon or imaaraton se mahangi ho gai he
 It would not be right to say expensive, it should be said that ticket prices are also the highest
 jabaki dilli ke laal kile kaa tikat 35 rupaya he, tajmahal kaa 50 rupaya
 Every year 70 to 80 lakh tourists come to see Taj Mahal, out of which 8 lakh are foreign tourists, there is a ticket of 1100 rupees for foreign tourists
 tajmahal se 20 karod kii kamai hoti he
 At the moment when two CBI officers have been thrown out of office for suing each other, the third officer is also facing charges, the Reserve Bank of India is fighting for its autonomy, even on the Election Commission Questions are being raised
 pradhanmantri patel ke banaae hue steel frem ko yaad kar rahe hai
 The warlord who fought for everyone, everyone is fighting for that chieftain
 isliye sardaar sardaar the, unhen lekar ladane vaale sardaar nahin ho sakate hai
 Come to the website of Statue Of Unity, our Sardar is 182 meters high at the forefront
 uske baad 153 meter oonchi he china kii spring temple of buddha
 At number three is the 120 meter tall statue of Ushiku Daibushu of Japan
 chauthe number par he 93 meter oonchi america kii stechu of liberty, jisaki oonchii 93 meter he
 The fifth number is the statue of the Mother Land Calls of 85 meters high form and the sixth number is Christ the Redeemer of Brazil, 38 meters high
 sardaar patel bharat kii raajnneeti ke ek varg main damit ichha ke rup main garh die gaye hai
 Neither Nehru nor Patel is being talked about without the competition of Nehru vs Patel
 ek bade varg ko lagata rahaa ki yadi patel pradhanmantri hote
 Whereas Patel never said that if he were the Prime Minister
 ve khud ko gandhi kaa sipaahi kehete the
 Nehru was considered his leader
 Statue Of Unity kii website par gandhi or nehru kii tasveeron ke bagair sardaar kii duniya badi to ho gai he, lekin akeli bhi ho gai he
 You can say that there is a statue of Sardar in the monuments named after Nehru
 yah sawaal bhi sahi he
 You yourself also heard the Prime Minister's speech
 unhone bahut hi sahajata se apane bhaashan main sardaar ke yogadanon kaa ekikaran apni sarkaar kii yojanaon se kar diya
 Even after this, the Prime Minister said that there should be no politics regarding the statue of Sardar
 unka khud kaa bhaashan raajnneeti se bharaa he yaa vaaki gaiyr raajnneetik bhaashan he, aapako tay karnaa he
 In fact, it is a great injustice with Sardar Patel's legacy that his talk is always in the context of Nehru, while his life was in reference to Gandhi
 unhone kabhi pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari nahin kii, na hi congress ke adhyaksh pad ke liye gutbazi
 Once he left the practice, Aisho left the rest and left for a lifetime
 nehru or patel donon hi waakif the ki unhen lekar kis tarah kii charchaa hoti he
 In December 1950, Patel had to leave Delhi at the behest of doctors
 chhodane ke pehle patel ne emvi gadgil se kaha ki main ab nahin jiunga
 Make a promise to me gadgil ne haa kaha tab patel ne unka haath apane haath main lekar kaha ki pandit ji se tumhaare jitne bhi matbhed hon, lekin unka saath mat chhodana
 This was Sardar Patel
 rajmohan gandhi ne patel kii jeevani main pej number 532 par yah prasang likhaa he
 On 2 October 1950, he said that Jawaharlal Nehru is our leader
 baapu ne unhen apana uttaradhikari niyukt kiya he
 And they have also announced this
 baapu ke saare sainikon kaa farz he ki ve jawaharlal ji ke adeshon kaa puraa paalan karen
 i am not a disloyal soldier
 main jis sthaan par hum uske bare main mujhe kabhi vichaar bhi nahin aata tha
 i know enough that i am where i was kept
 dilli chhodkar jate hue sardaar patel ne gadgil se kyon kaha ki vaada karo, jawahar ko akelaa mat chhodana
 There were solid differences between the two but mutual respect was also strong
 maniben patel sardaar kii beti thim
 Dahyabhai Patel Vallabhbhai Patel was his son
 sardaar patel ke nidhan ke baad dahyabhai patel congress ke tikat par 1957 or 1962 main loksabhaa kaa chunaav jite
 Maniben was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1952 and 1957 on a Congress ticket and then went to the Rajya Sabha
 maniben ne apatkaal kaa virodh kiya or tab janata party ke tikat par mehsana se 1977 main chunaav jeet gayi
 Shesh Narayan Singh has given this information on his Facebook page
 yah jaankaree dete hue bhi dukh ho rahaa he ki ham itihaas ko kin chashmon se dekhne lage hai
 History is for understanding, not for accounting
 aaj indira gandhi kii punyathithi he
 Indira Gandhi was assassinated on the same day and followed by a massacre with the Sikhs
 ajeeb sa muqabla he
 Somewhere the Sardar is being magnified and somewhere Indira
 hode main likhaa ja rahaa he ki indira ne bhi pakistan ke do tukade kar die
 Did not bow before America
 pradhanmantri modi ne unhen twit ke zarie shradhanjali di he
 There is no mention of the riots of 84 in his tweet
 kaayade se donon pakshon ko maare gaye sikhon ko yaad karnaa chahie tha
 This would have made our politics bigger and not smaller
 kitna acha hota ki rahul gandhi bhi or narendra modi bhi naransahaar main maare gaye sikhon ko yaad karte, raajnneeti ko hinsa se dur rakhane ke liye aaj bhi kehete to pataa chalata ki hamaare netaa hinsa ko lekar baad main kitna acha sochate hai
 In these pictures, you see Congress leaders other than Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ne indira gandhi ko vyaktigat rup main or rajaneta ke rup main bhi yaad kiya he
 The Congress is accused of never carrying forward Patel's legacy
 congress ko sochna chahie ki us par yah aarope lagane kaa mauka kahaan se aayaa
 It is not that there are no institutions, airports, hospitals, or cities named after Patel
 phir bhi yah jawaab congress ko dena he ki vah patel ko lekar kyon asahaj rahi
 In the last four years, Congress leaders and activists have not been able to defend the outrageous attacks on Nehru
 patel kaa bachaav kya karenge
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted that Sardar Patel was a patriot who fought for freedom, unity and secular India
 steel ke iraade vaale sardaar karunaa se bhare the, ve dil se congressi the, jinhone dharmandhta yaa sampradayakita ko kabhi bardaasht nahin kiya
 i salute this great son of India on his birth anniversary
 isi ke saath rahul kaa ek or twit he ki yah bhi vidambnaa he ki sardaar patel kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran ho rahaa he, lekin unhone jin sansthaanon ko banaaya ve sabhi dhahaae ja rahe hai
 Systematic fragmentation of India's institutions is nothing short of treason
 ekta kii pratimaa to ban gai, lekin aaj vaaki sardaar kii zarurat he
 When our politics goes into the debate of being a Hindu or not, being a real Hindu or being a fake Hindu, then it is time to search for the Sardar who has gone missing
 jo lohe kii tarah sampradayikta ke khilaaf the
 In 1941, when riots broke out in Ahmedabad, Sardar Patel said that what made you suddenly think that you started biting each other
 mujhe dukh is baat kaa he ki hamaari aabru chali gayi
 The name of the city of Ahmedabad was blurred
 kaise mitaayaa jaae ise
 The only way to erase it is to try to ensure that such an environment does not arise in this city again
 2002 main ahambadabad par phir se kalank laga tha
 Shouldn't everyone atone for the 84 and 2002 riots to this day? jab gandhi kii hatya hui tab grahamantri patel hi the
 He then banned the RSS
 balki apane mantralay ke adheen soochnaaon kaa hawala dete hue saaf-saaf kaha ki hatya ke baad sangh ke logon ne mithai banti thi
 On 11 September 1948, he wrote a letter to Patel's RSS sarsanghchalak MS Golwalkar that it is one thing to organize and help Hindus, but to take revenge on the helpless and innocent men, women and children for their suffering is another matter
 iske alaava ye bhi tha ki unke congress virodh ne, wo bhi is kathorta se ki na vyaktitv kaa khyaal, na sabhyataa kaa, na shishtataa kaa, janata main ek prakaar kii bechaini paidaa kar di
 All his speeches were full of communal poison
 hinduon main josh paidaa karnaa va unki raksha ke prabandh karne ke liye aavashwayak na tha ki zehar faile
 The result of this poison was in the end that the country had to bear the sacrifice of Gandhiji's priceless life
 sarkaar va janata kii ratti bhar sahanubhuti aresas ke saath na rahi, balki unke khilaaf ho gai
 The protest was further intensified by the joy expressed by the RSS people on Gandhiji's death and distributed sweets
 in halaat main sarkaar ko aresas ke khilaaf kadam uthaane ke alaava koi or rasta nahin bachaa tha
 People of the village around Sardar Sarovar Dam have raised questions about this statue
 72 gaanv ke logon ne kaha ki 31 aktubar ko pratimaa ke anaavaran ke virodh main upwas rakhenge
 The stove will remain closed
 22 gaanvon ke pradhanon ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhaa he ki yahaan ke jangalon, nadiyon, jalprapaaton, kheton ne sadiyon se hamaara khyaal rakhaa he
 We have been living around them, but now everything is being destroyed
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki yah kisi kii maut par jashn ke samaan he
 We think so only
 ham gaanv vaale bahut dukh ke saath kahana chaahate hai ki ham 31 aktubar ko aapkaa swaagat nahin karenge
 If you come like an uninvited guest, we will not welcome you
 agar sardaar patel ne dekha hota ki kaise prakritik sansadhano ko nasht kiya ja rahaa he, hamaare saath anyaay ho rahaa he to ve ro dete
 While we are raising our voice, your police is taking action
 aap hamaari takalifon ko sunne ke liye taiyaar kyon nahin hai
 But the Prime Minister has said that due to this statue, the tribal people around will get employment
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi kaha ki yahaan ek aisi ekta nursery bane ki yahaan aane vaala tourist apane ghar ekta kaa paudha le jaae or boetippaniyan Now the examination is yours, you, the public
 tourist spot ban gaya he
 So this spot is not free
 aapako bhi ye na lage ki aap sardaar kaa darshan muft main kar rahe hai isliye online tikat kii vyavastha he
 There are two types of tickets
 3 saal ke bacchon ko tikat nahin lagegaa
 It will cost Rs 350 to see Observation Deck view, Valley of Flower, Memorial, Museum & Audio Visual Gallery, SOU site, Sardar Sarovar Dam
 agar aap Observation Deck view, nahin janaa chahenge to uske liye alag se package he
 Adult people will get 60 rupees tickets and children 60 rupees
 bas kaa charge he 30 rupaya
 In the case of tickets too, Sardar's statue has become expensive with many palaces, forts and buildings in India
 mahangi kahana thik nahin hoga, kahana chahie ki tikat ke daam bhi sabase oonche hai
 While the ticket for the Red Fort of Delhi is 35 rupees, the Taj Mahal is 50 rupees
 tajmahal dekhne ke liye har saal 70 se 80 lakh paryatak aate hai, jinamein se 8 lakh videshi paryatak hote hai videshi paryatakon ke liye 1100 rupye kaa tikat he
 The Taj Mahal earns 20 crores
 is samay jab sibiai ke do-do afasar ek duusare par mukadmaa karne ke kaaran daftar se baahar kar die gaye hai, tisare afasar par bhi aarope lag rahe hai, reserve bank of india apni swaittata ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he, chunaav ayog par bhi sawaal uth ja rahe hai
 The Prime Minister is remembering the steel frame made by Patel
 jo sardaar sabake liye lade, us sardaar ke liye sab lard rahe hai
 Therefore the Sardar was the Sardar, there cannot be a Sardar fighting over him
 sardaar patel bharat kii raajnneeti ke ek varg main damit ichha ke rup main garh die gaye hai
 Neither Nehru nor Patel is being talked about without the competition of Nehru vs Patel
 ek bade varg ko lagata rahaa ki yadi patel pradhanmantri hote
