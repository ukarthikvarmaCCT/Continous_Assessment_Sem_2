jaahir he, gramin hakikaton ke bare main meri jaankaree bilkul shunya thi
 My experience of Haryana was limited to the policemen working in Delhi, but this job changed me forever
 mujhe gaanvon main basane vaale asli bharat ke muddon or uski samasyaon ke bare main pataa chal gaya
 Haryana, unlike my earlier opinion, was a magnificent state, which was created in 1965 by separating the most backward areas of Punjab
 tab mana ja rahaa tha ki yah rajya zyada kaamyaab nahin ho paaegaa or vah apane karmchaariyon ko vetan bhi nahin de paaegaa
 But within five years this state became the number one state in the entire country, thanks to the efficient leadership and hard working bureaucracy of its powerful leader and then Chief Minister Chaudhary Bansi Lal
 haryana ne vikaas ke har kshetra main jhande gaade
 Behind this success story was the hand of a visionary leader, who received the full support of a tireless bureaucracy
 agar main shuruaati varshon kii baat karun to prashasnic seva main bhrashtachar naganya tha
 But the decline that started after a few years soon started going unbridled
 naukarshahi kaa focus kaamkaaj se hatakar netaaon ke prati nijee vafadari kii taraf chalaa gaya
 Initially, when i learned that some of our companions are deviating from the path, it did not bother us much
 hamane sochaa ki naitik maandand logon ke apane alag-alag hote hai
 But when it started to stain the reputation of our entire class, we had to be alert
 tab upi ke iees association ne apane andar hi ek chunaav karaane kaa ek aitihaasik kadam uthaaya taaki bhrasht tatwon kii pahchaan kii ja sake or unhen logon ke saamne laayaa ja sake
 Everyone was asked to name the three most corrupt officials
 shuru main bahuton ko is par aapatti hui, lekin yah bhrasht naukarshahon kii pahchaan karne main ek prabhavi tarika sabit hua
 After this people started differentiating between honest and corrupt
 bahut se rajnatik netaaon ne prashasan ke is ''ispati frem" ko baari nuksaan pahunchaaya
 He used the transfer as his weapon to discourage officers who did not cooperate and to break his back
 upi jaise rajyon main jila magistrate or espi kaa har kaarykaal agar kuch hakraton kaa nahin to kuch maheenon kaa ho gaya
 This upset the family of those officers
 har kuch maheene baad parivaar ko ek jagah se duusari jagah le jane or bacchon ke liye nae skool main daakhila karaane kii pareshaaniyon ke chalate bahut se adhikari netaaon ke aage jhukne ke liye taiyaar hone lage
 Some gave up easily and some after a few noses
 lekin us vakt civil socity or media khamosh rahaa
 Due to which corrupt people became powerful, and honest and principled people were marginalized
 civil seva main aana aasaan nahin hota
 Every year, lakhs of youths sit in their eyes for about 1,000 jobs with Sapna in their eyes
 bahut se log ise rashtriya shauk kaa naam dete hai
 In the early years of Azad India, only students of arts and social subjects could participate in the examination of civil service, because it was believed that their understanding is more comprehensive
 lekin aage chalakar yah pratiyogita sabhi vishyon ke chaatro ke liye khol di gai, jinamein ejeeniyar, doctor, sie, har koi hissaa le saktaa he
 This made the competition even more difficult
 zyaadaatar logon ke liye ab bhi iske peeche maanav seva kii prerana thi
 But for some, it was an opportunity to get rich quick
 is seva kii girti pratishtha kii vajah se log iske adhikariyon, yahaan tak ki varisht adhikariyon ko bhi ''babu" ke apmanjanak shabd se sambodhit karne lage
 The general opinion among the people is that the bureaucracy is inefficient and corrupt
 nishchit rup se yah zyaadaatar adhikariyon kii pratibha or unke charitra kaa sahi chithran nahin he
 The capabilities of our civil services, which include IAS, IPS and revenue services, are seen to have the greatest performance when they are involved in managing elections
 ye chunaav puri duniya main na sirf sabase bade hote hai, balki inasaanon dwaara prabandhit hone vaala sabase bada aayojan he
 India's elections are praised all over the world
 hillari clinton ne to ise gold standard kaha tha
 People probably do not know that the entire management is handled by the officers of the civil service, that is, 10 million government employees are involved in it
 sawaal yah he ki jis pratishthan ko akushal or bhrasht samajha jaataa he, vah chunaavon ke samay itani kushalta se kaise kaam karata he
 The secret of this is that then it is run by the Election Commission, which knows how to do good work from them
 bhrasht or aksham logon main se achche ko chhaant lo, eemaandaar ko rajnatik dabaav se bachaao or phir uskaa nateeja dekho
 The Election Commission ensures that they work honestly and fearlessly and increase the pride of the country

 Yes, police officers are given gallantry awards, but they are not as much as they are entitled to

 The Election Commission has also instituted awards for new experiments and good work which boosts their morale

 haftebhar par pehle uttarakhand main jo kudarat ne tabaahi machaai thi wo ab nae daur main pahunch gayi he
 Weather in Uttarakhand has again become a crisis
 raahat kaaryon par barish kii afat padi he
 It has been raining since Monday night in many areas of Uttarakhand
 dehradun, rishikesh, gochar or guptkashi main barish ho rahi he
 The Meteorological Department had predicted rains in various areas of Uttarakhand from today to 28 June
 barish se rescue oparation prabhavit hoga
 Rescue operations were also disrupted due to inclement weather on Monday
 abhi soobe ke vibhinn ilaakon 6000 log fanse hue hai
 But the helicopter is difficult to fly until the weather is clear, in which thousands of lives have been threatened
 mausam vibhaag ne to pehle hi andeshaa jataa diya tha ki somvaar se uttarakhand main barish hogi, jo mangalvaar yani aaj se or tej ho jaaegi
 According to estimates, Uttarkashi, Gangotri and Harsil areas have been raining since late at night

 According to the Meteorological Department, the region may receive between 40 and 70 mm of rain in Uttarakhand's four Dhams - Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath, Badrinath and Hemkund Sahib on Tuesday
 jaahir he iskaa bura asar rescue oparation par padegaa kyonki barish or kam viziblity main helicopteron kaa udaan bharna mushkil he
 If the helicopters do not take flight, people stranded in the inaccessible area will not be able to be transported to safe places as air route is the only means of evacuating people due to rains and landslides

 There are two types of statements about how many people were rescued on Monday

 vayusena ne 135 pheri lagaakar harsil se 1095 logon ko nikaala, jabaki itibipi ne badrinaath se saadhe chaar sau or gangotri maneri se 267 logon ko baahar nikaala
 The NDRF rescued 120 people from Harsil
 andiaref ke mutabik kedarnath or bhairon chetty ilaake main jitne bhi log jivit bache the, sabko nikaal liya gaya he
 According to this, now the rescue of about seven thousand people is left
 lekin, uttarakhand ke mukhya sachiv kaa daawa he ki sahi myne main sirf chaar hajaar hi vahaan fanse hai
 According to the ITBP, if the weather supports, the rescue operation can be completed within three days, but according to the Meteorological Department, there is no possibility of opening of the weather by June 28

 iske alaava teenon netaaon ne samudri suraksha evam connactivity ke mudde par bhi charchaa kii
 The first trilateral ministerial meeting between the three countries was held in 2015
 varishkadhikariyon ke strapar baithak 2011 se ho rahi he
 Pakistan has asked India to change its 'non-flexible' policy on Kashmir
 pakistan ne daawa kiya ki jammu kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang nahin he tathaa is mudde ko bhartiya samvidhan ke daayre ke bheetar nahin suljhaayaa ja saktaa
 Pakistan's State Department spokesman Abdul Basit told a TV channel that India would have to change its outlook and policy on the Kashmir issue
 unhone kaha, ‘‘jab ateet main gaiyr-lacheelee rahi bhartiya niti main badlaav aayegaa, to nishchit taur par donon deshon ke bich baatcheet phydemand sabit hogi
 Basit said that the Kashmir problem is an internationally recognized issue and the United Nations has also passed a resolution to resolve it
 unhone daawa kiya ki kashmir mudde ko kashmiri janata kii ‘aakankshaon’ ke anuroop hi suljhaana hoga
 Pakistan has always tried to resolve all issues with India, especially the Kashmir problem, in a peaceful manner
 basit ne aarope lagaaya ki bharat gat june se jammu kashmir main kathor bal prayog kar rahaa he
 Pakistan wants the atrocities by India to stop
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki kashmir mudde par donon desh dashakon se charchaarat hai
 This issue was at the top of the agenda in the composite dialogue process, but India never seriously tried to resolve the issue
 unhone kaha, ‘‘jab kabhi vaarta prakriya behaal hogi, hamen ummid he ki bharat yathartwaadee drushtikon apanaayegaa
 Basit said that it would not be meaningful to talk merely for talking

 After the process of widening of NH 87 in Haldwani has started the work of cutting more than 14 thousand green trees, but this is hurting the environment lovers
 mana jaataa he ki agar prithvi par maanav jivan he to uskaa ek bahut bada kaaran jalwaayu he or vah jalwaayu hone kaa mukhya kaaran he ped, paudhe or vanaspati
 Due to the continuous global warming and climate change in the world, all the countries are united and are constantly working together to save their environment by looking at the deteriorating environment
 logon ko chintaa hona swabhaavik bhi he, kyonki desh kii rajdhani dilli main is samay jo halaat hai usase yah andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki aane vaale dinon main paryaavaran par sankat or zyada gaharaa saktaa he, lekin in halaaton se adhikari abhi bhi sabak nahin le rahe
 The latest case is of Haldwani Terai Central Forest Division in Uttarakhand where the widening of NH 87 is in full swing
 uttarakhand main kiye ja rahe enech 87 ke chaudeekaran ko lekar khud sarkaar kitni chintit he is baat kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki enech chaudeekaran ke liye kaate gaye hajaaron vishalkayahre pedonki kshatipurti ke liye ek bhi ped ab tak nahin lagaaya gaya he
 In fact, the forest department gave permission to the forest corporation to cut thousands of trees from Rudrapur to Kathgodam without planting trees, of which the forest corporation started work on both sides of the road and cut 80 percent of the green trees
 rampur se kathgodam tak rashtriya rajmarg 87 ko four line main tabdeel kiya ja rahaa he jisaki lambaai kareeb 93 kilometre he
 This distance from Rudrapur to Kathgodam is about 40 kilometers, of which most of the area belongs to the forest department, in which about 15 thousand small and big green trees will be cut for widening of NH
 bade hare pedo ko kaate jane se paryaavaran premi aahat dikhaai de rahe hai
 Botanical experts say that the speed with which roads are being constructed in Uttarakhand and the green trees along the roads are being cut down, increasing the chances of environmental disturbance
 jaankaron ke mutabik aise bhi kai ped hai jo chote-chote kasbo ore shaharon kii pahchaan ban gaye the lekin project shuru hone ke baad bhi pedo kii jagah nae pedo kaa ropan naa hona paryaavaran ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he enech 87 main bhi yahi haal he
 According to the forest department, 14488 trees that are being gifted to NH 87 have been printed and handed over to the Forest Corporation for cutting
 kareeb 80 fisadi kaam puraa bhi kiya ja chukaa he
 To compensate for these trees, land has been found in the Terai Central Forest Division, but no money has yet been received to plant saplings
 unke mutabik jaise hi van vibhaag ke paas paisa aayega vaise hi pedo ko lagane kii karrwai shuru kar di jaaegi
 DFO Terai Central Forest Division said that, it will be time to tell whether new plants will be found in place of the 14,000 trees taken to build the sacrificial road
 badhate pradooshan se jahaan din pratidin desh kii rajdhani dilli kaa bura haal he usase ek baat to saaf ho gai he ki aane vaale dinon main paryaavaran kaa bahut bura haal hone vaala he
 The way the cutting of green trees is also being done for the widening of NH 87, it can be assumed that in the coming days, the situation of pollution in Uttarakhand is going to be similar to that of Delhi, the capital of the country

 It was selling the goods taken from the showroom at throwaway prices
 samay par iemai jamaa na hone par finance company ne aaropee kii detail khangaali to pataa chalaa ki finance ke samay jitne bhi aadhaar card kaa istemaal kiya gaya he, usamen photo to ek hi shaks kaa he magar usamen naam or pataa alag-alag darj he
 On the complaint of the finance company, the police laid a trap and nabbed the accused
 shuruuaat main to aaropee police ko gumraah karata rahaa lekin sakhti se poochtacha ke baad usne apnagunah kabuulakar liya
 More than 10 Aadhar cards have been recovered from the accused, in which only the photo is of him but the name and address are separately recorded
 in sabhi aadhaar card ko farji tareeke se banaaya gaya tha
 It is worth noting that considering the Aadhar card as a strong certificate, finance companies immediately approve the loan
 jiskaa phayda uthaakar aaropee finance company ko lakhon rupee kaa chuunaa laga rahaa tha

 bhartiya hockey team ke purv coach jose brasa ne videshi kochon kii vivaadit vidaai ke liye swatantraaa ke abhaav or adhikariyon ke dakhal ko doshi tehraaya
 Lacking independence, Brasa said that good coaches cannot work as puppets in the hands of Narinder Batra, the president of Hockey India
 brasa ne dach coach paul won es kii barkhaastagi par kaha, 'hockey india kai kochon ko barkhaast kar chukaa he or bharat main mujhase pehle rik charlsworth bhi isi tarah nikaale gaye the jo duniya ke sarvshereshth coach hai

 The problem is lack of independence

 Good foreign coaches will not approve of this and that is why we were all removed in the end
 'batra ko hataanaa jaruriis spanish coach ne aage kaha, 'samasya yah nahin he ki coach apane kaam ko bakhubi anjaam dene kii koshish nahin karte balki samasya vah vyakti he jo kochon ko kathputli banaakar rakhana chahta he or use hataanaa jaruri he

 bhartiya khilaadi kaaphi pratibhashali hai or unki patibaddhta kisi bhi coach ko bahut khush kar sakati he'
 Foreign coaches will be better When asked whether foreign coaches will be good for Indian hockey or Indian, they said that foreign coaches are better in Indian conditions

 It will be more challenging for the Indian coaches to deal with them

 in / bhale hi hindi filmon ne kamai ke maamle main 'mogul-e-aazam' or sholay ko kaaphi peeche chhod diya ho lekin ye donon hi filmein mile kaa pathar maani jaati hai
 That is why even today, all producer directors consider these films as ideal, or at least try to get around them
 film 'mogul-e-aazam' ke set ne to studio main film relies hone ke baad kai saalon tak logon kii dilchaspee banaaye rakhi or isko dekhne waalon main kai nami videshi hastiyaan bhi shaamil thim
 Now, in view of the passionate attachment of people to the film 'sholay', the Ministry of Tourism, Government of Karnataka has formulated an ambitious plan
 bengalooru se taqariban 70 kilometre dur bengalooru mysuru haive se nazadik ramnagaram main us jagah par jahaan sholay kii zyaadaatar shooting hui thi vahaan dubaara prakritik set banaaya jaae
 That is, the plan is to rehabilitate the film 'sholay' village Ramgarh
 chaahe wo gabbar singh kaa thikaana ho yaa phir thakur kii haveli yaa phir viru or jai kaa ashiana or ramnagaram stesan, sabhi kuch, taaki paryaton ko badhaava to mili hi, saath hi ek shandaar film se judi yaaden hameshaa tazaa rahen
 The comments in sab ke saath saath 3-di holographic riprogentation bhi hoga
 That is, some memorable scenes of 'sholay' will be seen happening around you, just as during the 2014 General Election, Narendra Modi was seen holding election meetings in many places simultaneously and it seemed as if he was standing in front
 yani gabbar singh ke saath-saath basanti apane dhanno ke saath aap ke aas-paas daudte nazar aaenge
 In Karnataka, Tourism Minister Priyank Kharge said that the project is expected to cost about 70 million rupees
 haalanki sarkaar kii manjuuri abhi milani he lekin unhen puri ummid he ki isamen koi aadchan nahin aegi
 Because special care will be taken that the ecological system there is not disturbed by this project

 karnataka main paryaton mantri priyank khadge ne bataaya ki is project par lagbhag 7 karod 50 lakh ke kharch aane kaa anumaan he
 Although the approval of the government is yet to be received, they are hopeful that there will be no hurdle in it
 kyonki iskaa khaas khyaal rakhaa jayega ki vahaan ke ichological system par is project kii vajah se avyavasthit na ho
 There is nothing like being thrilled about the last complete budget of the Narendra Modi government
 asal main, 2018 kaa bajet, hamen desh main aise bajaton ke yug main le jayega, jisamembejatako lekar koi utsaah nahin hoga
 May be this thing seems a bit bizarre to me because there has been a lot of speculation about the budget coming on 1 February
 tathy yah he ki bajet main upabhokta gunank sifer rahane vaala he or chunavi raajnneeti nitigat muddon par prabhavi sabit hogi, aise main 1 farvari ko dekhne vaali baat sirf arun jetali kaa rajkoshiya ankaganit hi hoga
 Let us take a look at some facts before we spend the day on budgets
 upabhoktaaon ke liye sifghbhi tak log bajet kaa intjaar karte the kyonki baaki chizon ke saath hi exise or sevakar main badlaav laae jate the
 Interestingly, unlike the old tradition of annual reforms in indirect taxes, now, the GST Council is bringing a mini budget every month
 jiesti ke baad, bajet main custom duty or asikar main badlaav ke behad simit sambhaavnaaen hi bachi rah gai hai
 However, as the sources of revenue collection for the government are drying up, the possibility of getting a big discount in the budget for the income tax payers is also looking bleak
 chunki, jiesti ne rajyon se kar lagane kaa adhikaar le liya he, isliye rajyon ke bajet bhi balance shit daakhil karne kii kasarat ke sivaa kuch or nahin rahenge
 However, for analysts and public finance enthusiasts, the revenue generating structure after GST and its sharing with states will be the new material for the next budgets
 sarkaar kaa khajaanahar bajet main, jab vitt mantri bade aavantnon kii ghoshnaa karte the to unke sur tej ho jate the, or baaki ke sadsy mej thapthapaakar iskaa swaagat karte the
 But this year the government has nothing special for such announcements
 sarkaar jiesti ke rajasav main ai kami or jiesti kii vajah se rajyon ko die jane vaale muaavje kii vajah se thodi mitavyayi hone kii koshish main he
 The government is actually forced to cut its expenses, including the much-needed capital cut
 rajkoshiya ghate main kami laane ke liye agast-sitambar 2017 main yah katautee dekhne ko mili thi
 Reports coming during the budget preparation process suggest that in 2018-19, the allocation to the railways can be reduced by 27 percent
 nijee nivesh or upbhog main ai kami se jujh rahi arthvyavastha ke liye sarkari kharche aakhri ummid kii tarah the or inamen ai kami buree khabar he
 Talking about financial management, the budget of state governments will also have its effects
 ghate se ubarne ke liye rajyon ne pehle hi puunjigat kharchon kii raftaar gata di he
 In the 2018-19 fiscal year, 17 states have reduced their capital expenditure by 10-25%
 big numberis bajet main upabhoktaaon ke liye kuch bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, the budget deficit will prove to be the most interesting figure
 jetali ne ab tak is morche ko kamyaabi se thame rakhaa he
 Nevertheless, the fiscal slippage in its last budget will be loud due to insufficient GST revenue collection, inadequate dividends from the Reserve Bank of India and lower than expected GDP growth
 pichley saal ke bajet ke saath jari kiye gaye ardhvarshik vittiya niti main sarkaar ne kaha ki vitt varsh 2018 ke liye vittiya ghate ko jidipi ke 3
 There is a target of bringing 2 per cent and up to 3 per cent for FY 2019
 lekin vinievesh ke lakshya (725 arab ru
 543 billion so far as against the target of Rs
 ) ke hairatnaak pradarshan ke baad bhi sarkaar ko vitt varsh 2018 main 10 se 30 bipies tak vittiya ghaataa uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 The government is trying to persuade public sector undertakings to pay additional dividends to halt this alarming increase in losses
 sarkaar vitt varsh 2018 or 2019 ke liye apane vinievesh lakshyon ko or badha sakati he
 In such a situation, the target of the current year - 725 billion - will not be met but from this source, next year's target will also be tried
 vitt varsh 2019 ke sandarbh main, sarkaar kaa lakshya 3
 2 per cent will be in financial deficit, whereas earlier it was going to be 3 per cent
 aakhir chunavi varsh main iske kharche badhenge
 With this budget, people were expecting the Modi government to make loud announcements before joining the election campaign for 2019
 baharhaal, 2018 kaa bajet nae yug ke bajaton kaa haraval bajet hoga--ye bajet aise honge jo logon kii bajaay arthshaastriyon ke liye mahatvapurn honge

 In this temple of Baba maha-mrityunjaya, there are mainly three times the aarti and in the prasad, they enjoy fruit and milk with curd
 apane aap main divya is dham main sirf muraadein hi puri nahin hoti, balki yahaan aane vaale bhakton ke rogon kaa ilaaj bhi yaheen ho jaataa he
 An example of this is the well behind the temple, known as the Dhanvantari coup
 manyata he ki yadi koi bhakt mrityunjay mahadev ke darshan ke baad is coop kaa jal grahan kare to uske pet sambandhi rog dur ho jate hai
 In addition to this, the incurable disease like leprosy is also cured after bathing with the water of this well in the tank near it
 is coop ke bare main bhi ek katha he ki ek baar dhanvantari vaidya ne ek rogi kaa bahut ilaaj kiya, magar use thik nahin kar paae
 Once that devotee came here and he recovered by drinking the water of this well
 baad main jab dhanvantari ko ye baat pataa chali to wo bhi is coop par aae or satya sidd hote dekh krodh main aakar apni sari jadi bootiyaan isi coop main daal deen
 Since then till today, the water of this follicle also cures many incurable diseases
 bhakt pehle mrityunjay mahadev ke darshan kar jal chadhaate hai phir coop kaa jal grahan karte hai

 Hello, i am Ravish Kumar
 vanshavaad bhartiya raajnneeti kaa ek aisa vishay he, jiskaa adhyayan or aalochana karte karte kai rajaneta or kai dal isi kii chapet main aa gaye
 Often this debate arises only in the context of the Gandhi family and no one is able to convert into a solid political discourse, leaving the rest of the family to tu-tu main-main
 vivaad kisase he, ek vyakti ke vanshavaad se, dianasti se yaa raajnneeti main dianasti yani vanshavaad kii samasyaon ko lekar
 Never does our politics have an honest debate on it
 sirf pathar phenk kar bhaag jaati he
 So even today the reference is Rahul Gandhi
 times naao ke arnab goswami jab sawaal karte hai ki aap baar-baar apane parivaar kaa naam kyon lete hai
 So Rahul says that i do not take names, must have taken once or twice
 asli mudda yah he ki is parivaar main main paidaa hua yah meraa chayan nahin tha
 i did not sign that i would like to be born into this family
 main vanshavaad kii avadharana ke khilaaf hum
 There is dynasty in BJP DMK and SP, also in Congress
 ise dur karne main vakt lagegaa
 Do you really think that dynasty or dynasty will ever be away from politics
 isaki jaden kya raaton raat gahari huin hai
 That is why my question today is what is this issue for
 rahul gandhi ko target karne ke liye yaa bhartiya raajnneeti ko vanshavaad se dur karne ke liye
 Is Rahul Gandhi's case serious because he came and became a prime ministerial candidate in the name of family or is it because dynasty is eating our politics
 pradhanmantri pad ke liye gambhir he yaa mukhyamantri yaa sansadeey siton par pariwaron ke kabje kaa masalaa bhi utana hi gambhir he
 Then why is there an Abdullah family in Jammu and Kashmir with which both Congress and BJP have joined hands
 phir kyon punjab main badal parivaar he, jo bijepi kii sahyogi he, phir kyon upi main yadav parivaar hai jisase congress haath milaati he, phir kyon bihar main yadav or paswan parivaar he jisase congress gathbandhan karti he
 Then why there is a Thackeray family in Maharashtra, from which the BJP joins hands
 phir kyon madhyapradesh or rajasthan main sindhiya parivaar he, jo congress main bhi he, bijepi main he
 Some families continue to grow
 jaise mulaayam singh yadav kaa parivaar
 Family of Lalu Prasad Yadav, Family of Ram Vilas Paswan
 bade pariwaron main jaise khet−makaan banta karte hai bhaaiyon ke bich usee tarah ab raajnneetik dal bhi bant rahe hai
 Apart from Shiv Sena, these days you must be reading news about DMK, an important party of Tamil Nadu
 pita karunanidhi ne apane bete alaagiri ko nikaal diya he kyonki unhone apane bhai stallin ke marane kii ashanka pita se zaahir kar di thi
 In this quarrel, grandson Dayanidhi Maran and daughter Kanimozhi also continue to be named
 punjab main badal parivaar ke sambandh main jab maine punjab uniwarsity ke professor ashutosh se baat kii to unhone kaha ki jaise mughal badshaah apni satta ke vistaar ke liye rajput raajaaon se shaadiyaan kiya karte the, vaise hi punjab main congress or akali bhale hi alag dal hai, magar inke bade netaa aapas main saas, bahu, betaa, damaad, beti or saalaa or sadhu lagate hai
 Giving an example of a leaflet written by Punjab University student Gunarit Kaur in MA, Ashutosh said that Prakash Singh Badal's cabinet minister Aadesh Pratap Singh is his son-in-law
 aadesh punjab main das saal tak congressi mukhyamantri rahe pratap singh kairon ke bete hai
 Congress Chief Minister Harcharan Singh Brar's sisters-in-law are sisters after Beant Singh, wife of Simranjit Singh Mann, wife of Captain Amarinder Singh
 usee tarah majithia parivaar congressi mana gaya, lekin surajeet singh majithia ke bete vikram singh majithia ab akali main he
 His sister is married to Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal
 vikram khud bhi akali se vidhayak or cabinet mantri hai
 Through these marriages, Badal saheb has also strengthened his hold in Malwa and Majha areas
 bhartiya raajnneeti main parivaarwaad ko lekar patric french ne ek gambhir adhyayan kiya he
 Patrick studied the family background of 545 mps of the 15th Lok Sabha, while the family background of 255 mps did not seem special, but 156 mps belong to family background
 kareeb 29 pratishat saansadon kaa family conection he
 Patrick works wonders for extracting the percentage of family members in French parties and finds that Rashtriya Lok Dal is a party which is hundred percent family
 iske paanchon saansad khandaani hai
 In today's daily Hindustan, an advertisement has also been published for the Sankalp rally in Agra
 wo bhi raajnneeti ko svachh karne ke liye
 There are only three faces in this advertisement
 purv pradhanmantri choudhary charan singh, ajit singh or unke bete jayant choudhary
 According to Patrick French, dynasty among parties is as follows: ensipi − 77
 7 out of 8 percent 9 bijedy − 42
 9 percent 6 out of 14 congress − 37
 78 out of 5 percent 208 sapa − 27
 3 percent 6 out of 22 bijepi − 19 pratishat 116 main se 22 It is not strange that someone attacks dynasty and mentions his family
 chaay vaala, doodh vaala yaa garib parivaar vaala
 No one should mention how
 vanshavaad ko lekar rahul gandhi ko gheraa jaataa he or unase unke pita ke bayaan kaa hisaab poocha jaataa he
 Isn't it strange? baap kaa hisaab bete se
 But is it not strange that the same son says on the question of fearing Modi that i have seen the death of father in my family, the death of grandmother, i am not afraid of anyone
 vanshavaad mudda he yaa masala
 Are our parties really raising their voice against it seriously? aaie dekhen raveesh uwach

 purv bhartiya captainrahul dravidane mukhya kocharavi shastrike england daure par 'sarvshereshth team' sambandhi bayaan par kaha ki unke liye yah myne nahin rakhata ki koun sarvshereshth he or koun nahin
 More important now is what the team learned from him and how to proceed
 bhartiya team ko haal ke england daure main paanch test maichon kii siries main 1-4 se karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 But Shastri, meanwhile, sparked a new debate by saying that the Virat Kohli-led team was the best in the last 15-20 years
 sunil gavaskar sahit kai purv cricketron ne unke is bayaan kii aalochana kii thi
 India won the last Test series in England in 2007 and Dravid was the captain at the time and they believe that Shastri's statement was exaggerated
 dravid ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki is puri baat ko badha chadhaakar pesh kar diya gaya or shastri kya sochate hai or kya nahin, is par tippanee karne main meri dilchaspee nahin he
 What is important is what we have learned from all these things and what we should do next time we visit

 i don't think that way, because everything was exaggerated
 mere liye mahatvapurn yah he ki hamane is sabase sabak siikhaa he or agali baar england daure par ham kya behatar kar sakate hai
 However, Dravid admitted that the Indian team, especially the bowling attack, was very good, but lost the opportunity due to lack of opportunities
 unhone kaha, 'hamen teen yaa chaar saal main ek baar england daura karne kaa mauka miltaa he or khilaadiyon or koching staff ko bhi niraashaa hoti he kyonki koi nahin jaanata ki agle chaar varshon main kya hoga
 Our team was really good this time
 hamaara gendbaaji akraman bejod tha
 Dravid said, "I think the team will also realize that they had opportunities
" nishchit taur par is siries ke kuch sakaaratmak pahalu bhi rahe
 Our bowling and fielding was good, especially our catching was very good
 lekin jaise maine pehle kaha ki hamaare paas maukey the, lekin is baar ham unka phayda nahin uthaa paae
 If we get a chance to tour England in four years, then it is disappointing

 Dravid said, 'actually in the tournament the entire focus is being focused on Pakistan, but other teams are also doing well
 bangladesh acha khel rahaa he
 He defeated Sri Lanka easily
 afghanistan ne dikhaaya ki uski team bahut majboot he
 We should not focus only on Pakistan

 The BJP does not like the prosperity and prosperity of Bengal
 unase yah dekha nahin ja rahaa he ki kaise gangasagar se lekar durga puja tak kaa tyohaar thik tareeke se manaaya ja rahaa he
 Mamta said that we had defeated the central government peacefully in the by-election by 60,000 votes and we will still win

 They also want to control the media in the state
 wo kuch had tak yah kar bhi rahe hai, lekin ye bahut hi sharmnaak he
 Even further, he heard the BJP being very good
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ke logon ne apni vishwasaneeyata kho di he
 How can they even say that they will control the security forces and the Trinamool Congress
 apni raajnneeti chamakaane ke liye wo naa keval hamen pareshaan kar rahe hai balki isamen adhikariyon ko bhi ghaseet rahe hai
 Is this the federal structure? bengal ko chhodkar ye desh ke sabhi rashtriya or kshetreey media sansthaanon ko nigaraanee main rakh kar control kar rahe hai
 Their people monitor the media

 When they can hold elections in Tripura, Rajasthan in one day then why not in Bengal

 Many opposition parties have expressed their displeasure over this and alleged that this is being done to benefit the BJP

 And we all know where you are doing

 So don't make any mistake by mistake
 ham press kii aazaadee or chunaav ayog kaa sammaan karte hai
 This issue is about elections
 jo bhaajapa kah rahi he wo ramayana yaa quran nahin he
 He will lose himself from what he is doing in Uttar Pradesh

 Camera number one (at 5
40 am in the morning) At this time a cleaning worker was working in the temple premises
 aam taur par subah se hi is aitihaasik jagah par bhakton kaa aana-janaa shuru ho jaataa he or isse pehle hi saafe-safaai rose kii baat he
 But then whatever happens on the other side of the wall behind this sweeper, it is not only this person, but all the people around him
 ek zordaar dhamaake ke saath diwaar ke us paar se dhul or dhuen kaa ek gubaar uthta he
 And there is chaos in the entire temple
 ye dhamaakaa itnaa zordaar he ki safaikarmi sahamkar apni jagah se dur ja khadaa hota he or ye samajhane kii koshish karata he ki akhir ye maajaraa kya he? lekin itnaa hone ke baavjood wo diwaar ke us paar jane kii himmat nahin juta paata or bhagkar apni jaan bachaata he
 This is the sixth of the ten blasts on Sunday at the Mahabodhi Temple in Gaya, which took place between the main temple and the gate and was captured in CCTV cameras
 camera number do (vaqt subah ke 5
 40 minutes) The devotees started coming to the temple
 mandir ke get se logon kii awajahi jari thi
 And just like the previous blast, another blast across the wall once again made everyone tremble
 is baar yahaan dhul or dhuen ke alaava bam ke tukade or aas-paas ke ped-paudhon ke hisse bhi hawa main bikhar gaye
 In this attack, a boy and girl who came to worship in the temple narrowly survived
 mukhya mandir or get ke bich hua ye dhamaakaa mahabodhi mandir main ravivaar kii subah hue das dhamaakon main saatvaan tha
 And then the serial blasts that took place on a lively basis scared people badly
 camera number teen (vaqt subah ke 5
 42 minutes) This camera captures a picture of a Buddhist monk injured in a blast after two minutes
 hamale main zakhmi is bhikshu ko ek bhakt sahaara dekar mahafooj thikaane kii taraf le jane kii koshish karata he or mandir ke tamaam log aisi kisi jagah kii talash main hai, jahaan wo apni jaan bachaa paaen
 Meanwhile, other monks also come forward to inquire about the injured monk
 camera number chaar (vaqt subah ke 5
 42 minutes) Constant blasts brought panic to all the people who came to the temple
 is camere main mandir ke bhagdad kii tasviren kaid hai
 While some people are trying to go out of the stairs, in the second picture, all the people are running out of luck
 koi bachche ko god main liye yahaan se nikalne kii koshish main he, to koi apane logon ko yahaan se nikaalane main laga he
 Where is the picture of the terrorist? The date recorded in the cameras is definitely going back 24 hours from its time, but according to the administration, 14 out of the 15 CCTV cameras in the temple were working during the blast
 ab sawaal ye he ki in camaron main se kismen dhamaakon se pehle aatankwaadiyon ke aane kii tasviren kaid hui or kismen nahin, ye philhal koi nahin jaanata
 But these pictures of the explosion in some cameras are a witness to the fact that the face of terrorists must have come in some camera
 bhagwaan bharose thi surakshaek rahasyamayi shaks mandir main gum-gum kar bamon kaa jaal bicha rahaa tha or mandir ke surakshakarmi chaiyn kii neend so rahe the
 An eyewitness reported that he saw the suspected terrorist roaming the temple
 usne bataaya ki vah aatanki titali kii tarah gum-gum kar puure mandir main chakkar laga rahaa tha or yahaan koi security guard nahin tha
 In fact, like other days, this day, this eyewitness (ram Avatar Prasad, changed name) bowed head in the temple and reached here at five in the morning
 jab ve mandir kii parikrama kar rahe the, to ek 20-25 saal kaa noujvaan behad hadabdaahat main do baigon ke saath mandir main jagah-jagah gum rahaa tha
 a black bag was on his shoulder, while one in his hand
 or chunki itani subah mandir main kisi bhi bhakt ke do-do baigon ke saath itani jaldbaazi main hona ek ajeeb baat thi, raagavataar ko uski harakat khatak rahi thi
 Ram Avatar reported that he was a dark man
 raagavataar ne tab is shaks ke bare main surakshakarmiyon ko bataane kaa faisalaa kiya, magar afsos puure mandir main unhen aisa ek bhi surakshakarmi nahin mila, jisase wo is rahasyamayi insaan kii shikaayat kar pate
 Defeated, he told a sweeper in the temple about him and went ahead with the intention of revolving
 lekin iske chand minuton ke baad jo kuch hua, uske bare main unhone sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Serial blasts had started in the temple
 chashmadid raagavataar prasad ne bataaya ki jab vah baahar aayaa, to pehla blast ho gaya
 The state of security arrangements in the historic heritage of an internationally important Kahilyi government was when the IB and Delhi Police, including the IB and Delhi Police, warned the Bihar government months ago about the possibility of a blast in this temple
 maukey par haalat ye thi ki itnaa sabakuch hone ke baavjood mandir main suraksha kii zimmedaari nijee surakshakarmiyon ke hawaale thi or aise main vahaan duniyabar se aanevaale bhakton kii hifaazat kii koi guarantee nahin thi
 After all, what was the reason for this poor attitude towards security? When the same question was asked to DM Murugan of Gaya, he bluntly said, 'what had to happen happened
 'vaise jab rajya ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar hi itane gambhir masale par zimmedaari kii gend naukarshahon ke paale main daalane main lage hon to naukarshahon kaa ye ravaiya koi bahut hairaan karanevaala nahin he
 When Nitish Kumar was asked about this, he said that DG will tell
 kab hogi karrwai?baharhaal, hifaazat main barti gai is jabardast kahili ke liye kab kiski javabdehi tay hogi, ye to vakt aane par pataa chalegaa, lekin philhal in puure halaat ke maddenzar itnaa zarur kaha ja saktaa he ki agar mandir main suraksha intazaam chaak-chauband hote, to shaayad in dhamaakon ko taala ja saktaa tha
 Who did the explosion in Buddha's city? Serial blast again and again the same IM ie Indian Mujahideen
 desh kii tamaam suraksha agenciyaan iem ke modul ko todane ke chaahe lakh daawein karen, har dhamaake ke saath iem kaa naam jud hi jaataa he
 Now in the serial blast in Bodh Gaya, doubt is also towards this IM
 akhir in dhamaakon main aisa kya he, jo police kaa shaq iem kii taraf he? is bare main jaanch jari he or desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency suraag talashne main juty he
 The investigative agency is about to interrogate a man named Anwar Hussain to find the hidden face behind the blasts
 anwar ko kolkata se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 It is alleged that he is a member of the terrorist organization Indian Mujahideen and is believed to be very close to Riyaz Bhatkal
 aarope ye bhi he ki anwar ne hi pune dhamaakon ke liye ardex kii supplai kii thi
 Suspicion of Indian Mujahideen is hidden in the foundation of Anwar's questioning
 khabar he ki suraksha agenciyon ko yakeen ho chalaa he ki bodhgaya dhamaakon ke peeche indian mujahiddeen kaa haath he
 a total of 13 bombs were planted on Sunday, in which 10 exploded and three were found alive
 bataaya gaya he ki jinda bam or mandir ke chappe-chappe kii talaashi se jaanch agenciyon ko dhamaake se kuch ahm suraag mili hai
 In the investigation till now, a cylinder of agencies has been found on which Buddha is written in big letters
 iske alaava ane ko ek urdu main likhi chitthee milane kii bhi khabar he
 Initial forensic investigations have ruled out the use of RDX
 har bam main kareeb 150 gram ammonium nitrate, sulfur, potashium or keelon kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Apart from this, a watch used as a timer has also been found from the blast site
 dhamaake kii jagah se ek vinod mistre naam ke shaks kaa ycard bhi police ne baraamad kiya he jisase poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 It is being told that Vinod Mistry has been a history sheeter
 mandir se mili suraag or sandigdhon se poochtacha ke boote hi jaanch agenciyaan dhamaakon ke gunahagaaron tak pahunchane kii koshish main juty hai
 After killing Kali, the ritual of rituals has started once again
 ek taraf jaanch agenciyaan maukey se bam ke chharre been rahi hai, to duusari taraf siyaasi taur par phase seaving kii kavayad jari he, lekin in sabakaa nateeja kab nikalegaa, koi nahin jaanata
 Nitish Kumar has said that the blasts cannot be stopped completely
 bihar main sushasan ke swayambhu samraat ne 32 ghante baad shanti ke dushmano ke saamne hathiyaar daal die
 After this, no door of hope is left open, but some law, some politics, some shame and some politics, something has to be done in the name of investigation

 dilli ke bavana upachunaav main jeet ke liye raajnneetik dal jabardast jaddojahad karte najar aa rahe hai
 The biggest challenge is to win public confidence for the Aam Aadmi Party, which takes power in Delhi

 The candidates of the three parties have filled their nominations and are campaigning fast in Bawana
 charchaa tej he ki 'aap' bavana main seat bachaane, bijepi ek or vidhayak jitaane, jabaki congress vidhansabha main khaataa kholane kii jaddojahad kar rahi he
 The parties have changed two candidates
 One special thing in this by-election is that two of the three main candidates are defectors

 AAP candidate Ramchandra has been the leader of BSP

 Let us know that on Friday, 7 opposition parties including Congress gave notice to Naidu, the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, to initiate the process of removing him from the post, alleging misconduct against Chief Justice Mishra
 sansadeey niyamon kaa ulanghanrajyasabha ke sabhapati ko notice saunpane ke baad vipakshi dalon ne samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit kiya tha
 While reviewing the notice, the Rajya Sabha officials noted that it was a violation of parliamentary rules to make it public before the chairman accepts the notice

 unhone kaha ki aisa prastaav laana congress kii mahamoorkhtaa he, jaisaa ki kehete hai, ‘vinaash kaale vipareet buddhi’, usee tarah yah congress party kii ‘vinaash kaale pappu buddhi’ he
 Accused of insulting the supreme post of the judiciary, the Congress has sought to disassociate itself from the judicial and administrative functioning of Chief Justice Deepak Mishra till it is cleared of allegations of alleged misconduct

 We paid in the Bihar elections, so this time both of us (bjp-sangh) were cautious and in just two hours the entire dispute was clarified
 '' sukun bhari saans lete hue bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kii yah tippanee doodh kaa jala chacha bhi phoonk-phoonk kar peetaa he vaali kahawat ko charitaarth kar rahi thi
 At the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF) on 20 January evening, when senior Sangh leader Manmohan Vaidya allegedly lobbied for the abolition of reservations, the BJP strategists in the UP elections were breathless
 vajahah bihar chunaav ke dauraan sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat kaa aarakshan kii samiksha vaala bayaan party par baari pad gaya tha to ab manmohan vaidya ke bayaan se iskaa andeshaa khadaa ho gaya tha
 It is the biggest irony of the BJP that it has been repeatedly stuck in the quandary of reservation and this incident comes from the bjp's mother organization
 pradhanmantri narendra modi buree tarah bhanna uthe
 On this, the activism of the top strategists of the government and the BJP increased, the phones of Jaipur rose
 rajasthan bijepi ke adhyaksh ashok paranami ko dilli se pehla phone gaya jo us vakt jeelef main sangh ke sah sarkarywah dattatreya hosbale, akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya or mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke saath maujuud the
 After this, the cold evening of Delhi and the cold cold in the city of pink, the control of damage control in the city of sweat continued till late night
 darasal, jeelef main jati paddati, aarakshan or sachhar report se jodate hue muslim aarakshan ko lekar sawaal poocha gaya tha
 In response, Vaidya called the Muslim reservation against the basic spirit of the constitution and promoting separatism
 lekin vivaad unke is bayaan se hua jisamen unhone essi-asti aarakshan ke sandarbh main dow
 B
 aar
 Quoting Ambedkar, he said that it is not appropriate to have the provision of reservation forever and that it should be repealed at the earliest and bring time for equal opportunities
 hosbale ne varna vyavastha ko apraasangik bataaya or jatigat aarakshan ko samvidhan ke anuroop qaraar diya
 Hosabale says to India Today, "both the talks took place at the same stage at a three-minute interval, which spoke of the Sangh's support for caste reservation
 lekin kareeb ghante bhar baad pataa chalaa ki aarakshan par puure sandarbh ko hi badalakar bhram failaa diya gaya he
 There is an election environment, so naturally it was linked to the election, so i decided there to make it clear and called the media and reiterated what was said on the stage with clarity
 ''hosbale ke baad vaidya ne bhi is maamle main apana spashtikaran diya
 But the beating of the BJP had increased because the party had suffered a lot due to the statement of Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat during the Bihar elections

 Here, senior ministers of the party and government in Delhi continued till late at 2 pm to ensure that the news that appeared in the media gave priority to the news of the Sangh's reversal
 khud bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke karyaalay se pravaktaaon ko taakid kar di gai ki sangh ke muslim aarakshan vaale bayaan or jatigat aarakshan ko lekar khandan ko purajor dhang se bahes main rakhe
 On this issue, Vaidya says, "questions should be asked only to those who raise unnecessary controversy
" main abhi is par tippanee nahin karuunga
 "A BJP leader says that opponents should look into history because the religion was first mentioned in the reservation in 1916 when there was talk of a separate electoral college that sowed the seeds of the indo-pak partition and that was what Vaidya intended
" 
 unka kahana he ki adivasee or daliton par samooche bharat main kaam karne vaali ekmaatr sanstha sangh he isliye yah kahana yuktisangat na hoga ki sangh kii manshaa aarakshan ko khatm karne kii he
 But other than these arguments, the current question is that which has been the center of debate in BJP since the time of LK Advani
 usee samay se yah charchaa rahi he ki vishuddh rajnatik vishyon par sangh ke vichaar bijepi ke liye anukool nahin hote
 Now the BJP is in power and any such statement of the Sangh in the political arena is bound to be deeply veiled
 sangh ke kisi vichaar kii pratikriya bhi swaabhaavik he, aise main bijepi ke saath-saath sangh ko bhi paripakvata dikhaani hogi
 But now the Sangh will have to decide whether it will be balanced in view of the compulsion of its political face BJP or would like to take missionary direction

 film kaa naam: he brodiarector: ajay chandokstar cast: ganesh acharya, prem chopra, maninder singh, hanif hilaal, nupur sharma, indira krishnaivadhi: 113 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 1 starnirmaataa nirdeshak koreographer or actor ganesh acharya pehali baar puri tarah se acting ke liye maidan main kud pade hai, kyon ? iskaa jawaab unki ye film zarur degi
 This is Ajay Chandhok's sixth film as a director, the first five films have disappointed the audience, now whether 'hey Bro' is the film that lifts the graph of Ajay Chandhok, let's find out the story
 ' Hey bro 'is the story of Gopi (ganesh Acharya), who lives with his grandfather (prem Chopra) in the village of Rajasthan and his grandfather tells Gopi that he has another twin brother who grows up between his parents The floor With a subsequent mother had gone to Mumbai in childhood
 ab gopi ne apane bhai kaa cheharaa bhi nahin dekha tha, lekin judawaan hone kii vajah se wo mumbai jaakar apni maa or bhai kii talash karne lagata he
 If Gopi does not have a picture of his brother, he keeps asking everyone with his own picture because he feels that the twins look the same
 mumbai aakar uski mulaakaat hoti he inspector shiv (maninder singh) se, lekin gopi ko nahin pataa hota he ki shiv hi uskaa judwa bhai he
 Then Shiva clashes with Mafia Baba (hanif Hilal)
 ab mafia baba, shiv or gopi ke ird gird hi ye kahani ghoomane lagati he, or kya gopi ko uskaa bhai or maa milte hai? yahi kahani he 'he bro' kii
 Why Watch: The film has only one song 'birju' which is worth watching where Amitabh Bachchan, Ranveer Singh, Hrithik Roshan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgan, Prabhu Deva are seen dancing together in the same song
 to agar wo ek gaanaa dekhnaa he to aap film dekh sakate hai, anyathaa paise bachaaie
 Why not see: How many films have been made on the twin brothers, but 'hey Bro' seems to be the weakest film made on this subject
 kehane ko kamedi film he lekin shaayad hi koi aisi jagah ho jahaan aapako hansi aae
 Apart from Maninder Singh, Hanif Hilal, Nupur Sharma as well as choreographer Ganesh Acharya also failed in acting
 upi vidhansabha chunaav karaari ke baad na sirf akhilesh or mayawati saath aane ko taiyaar dikh rahe hai balki 2019 ke liye mahagathbandhan kii kavayad bhi teji pakad rahi he
 This is the reason that leaders of all the parties are ready for Lalu's grand rally to be held in August
 sutron ke anusaar akhilesh or mayawati lalu kii mahareli main saath aane vaale hai
 After the defeat of UP, now rival parties like Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party have started worrying about their future
 yahi vajah he ki chunaav main jo do partiyaan ek-duusare kii jaani dushman bani hui thim, ab aapasi gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar khadi dikh rahi hai
 The recent statements of Akhilesh and Maya have predicted a kind of Bihar grand alliance formula to be implemented across the country, but will it be that easy? The answer is no
 mahagathbandhan kii raah ke ye hai 5 bade rode-1
 Who was the leader of the grand alliance? Soon after the bjp's bumper victory in the UP elections, there were statements of Congress and JDU about forming a grand alliance
 lekin saath hi netaa koun hoga isapar bhi bayaanbaji shuru ho gai
 Congress said that there can be no other leader except Rahul Gandhi, then JDU said that only Nitish can give a contest to Modi
 baad main nitish kaa bhi bayaan aayaa ki agar upi main congress-basapa or sapa milakar lade hote to bijepi se 10 pratishat zyada vot pate
 BJP lost in Bihar because the opposition was united here
 ab yahi ekajutata puure desh main dikhaani hogi
 Then the fleet will cross
 lekin yahaan sawaal ye he ki modi ke khilaaf ek netaa par kya raay banegi
 Rahul Gandhi, Nitish, Mulayam, Mamta, Lalu, Mayawati, Naveen Patnaik will all have their eyes on the extent to which they will be able to agree on the PM face
 2
 The statement of the satraps regarding the limited mass alliance is fine, but there is no leader in all the opposition parties who has influence in more than one state
 mulaayam singh yaa akhilesh kaa prabhaav sirf upi main ho saktaa he
 Mayawati is clear from UP itself, the effect is doubtful in other states
 lalu kii party ne nitish lahar ke boote jaise-taise satta main vaapasi kii he
 Nitish Kumar's party does not show influence outside Bihar
 bihar vidhansabha main bhi jediu duusare number par he
 There is also doubt as to how much support Nitish's ambition for PM post will get from the ally RJD
 mamata banerjee kaa bengal main acha prabhaav he lekin baaki rajyon ke kshetreey dal unke netritv ko kitna maanenge
 The influence of the Congress can be considered across the country, but since 2014, the graph of the Congress has been falling and questions are being raised within the party about Rahul Gandhi's leadership ability
 3
 What will happen to the parties that have fought amongst themselves in the states? Modi opposition is fine, but what will happen to the mutual equations of the opposition parties? Maya and Akhilesh may be the compulsion to save existence in UP, but to what extent will the congress-trinamool congress-left come together in Bengal
 south main kya diemke-ediemke saath aaenge? bihar main sapa-basapa-congress-areldi kya saath aa sakenge
 There are many questions that raise questions on opposition solidarity against the Modi wave
 4
 What will be the factor other than Modi opposition? The concept of grand alliance is fine but will this grand alliance only go against the Modi factor among the public
 aise vakt main jab har chunaav main modi naam se bijepi jeet rahi he aise main sirfmodi kii aakraamak nitiki khilaafat kitna vot dilaa paaegi ye bhi bada sawaal hoga
 The Congress itself is suspicious of this factor
 upi chunaav ke baad congress kii andruni report main saaf taur par kaha gaya ki hindutv ke khilaaf party kii chhavi or sirf modi virdohi dikhne ke kaaran party ko haal ke chunaav main nuksaan hua he
 Rahul Gandhi himself is working on a new strategy to take the party's strategy forward
 yahaan tak ki aam aadmi party ke bare main bhi khabar he ki wo bhi modi virodh kii apni ranneeti par punarvichaar karne lagi he
 5
 jamini str par gathbandhan kaa kaise tay hoga sameekaran?mahagathbandhan ke naam par agar ye do darjan se zyada partiyaan ek ho bhi jaati hai to inke kaaryakarta kitne saath aaenge ye factor bhi ahm hoga
 In UP, the sp-congress contested the elections together, but in many seats, the candidates of both parties entered the fray
 chunaav main haar ke turant baad kai ummidavaaron ne ek-duusare kii partiyon par bhitarghaat kii aarope lagaana shuru kar diya
 This will also happen in other states recently

 a huge accident took place at Amber Fort, about eight kilometers from Jaipur yesterday, when the elephant carrying two German tourists to the Amber Fort escaped uncontrollably towards the forest
 ganimat yah rahi ki hathini par savaar donon videshi paryatak or mahavat ne kud kar jaan bachaai

 When i saw Taapsee Pannu and Amitabh Bachchan's 'pink', a lot went around in my mind
 aakhir is kathanak kii tarah haath main bag, ankhon main sapane or dimag main khub sanbhalkar chalane kii hidaayaton ke saath dilli main meri bhi entry hui thi
 In the last decade, there has been a lot of friendship and parties with the boys
 afaire rahe bhi or toote bhi
 And they were discussed a lot
 vahiin girls bonding bhi bharpoor enjoy kii
 Sometimes the tension share, sometimes the wine-vodka bottle
 is tarah meraa har kadam jamaane ke saath chalate hue bhi ek daayre main tha
 Never misbehave with anyone, no quarrel of parking oonchi aawaaj main baat nahin

 # mindrocks16 ke manch par 'big bi' ne sunaae filmi dialogs
 
 
 But somewhere it seemed that despite every step of my life, people used to look at me and my friends of PG with strange eyes
 main tab karan ke bahut close thi
 We once sat late at that high class coffee shop in Connaught Place
 uske bahut kehane par dil ko laga tha ki offis cab main to dilli kii raat khub dekhi he, kyon na aaj'trusted dost'ke saath baahar nikal hi liya jaae
 i went with great enthusiasm but returned with the same frustration and despair
 tab main tumhen kuch kah nahin pai
 When your thoughts came to my problem, i was surprised
 phir tumhaara 'kuch fan' vaala 'ofer'
 Could not understand anything
 bas vahiin se tumhaara number block kar diya
 But the problem did not end by blocking you
 har dost main kahin na kahin mujhe samay-samay par tumhaari jhalak mahasoos hoti thi
 Reactions on things like my laughter, my clothes, my tattoos, my passion for piercing, my glass of wine, my office timing, my hobby of watching a late night movie, allowing mail friends to come to my room Were upset nahin samaj paa rahi thi ki kisko kya jawaab duun
 Whose mouth should i shut, and whom should i pull and slap? had to tab ho gai jab ek baar mere kajan ne hi meri nite shift par sawaal uthaa die
 And when i replied, i explained that this attitude is not good
 uski baat se mujhe laga ki chachaa ne use fahrenuniwarsitibhejkar galat hi kiya
 If he had to think the same, he would have studied here in a vocational college
 kam se kam ghar ke kai lakh rupee batch jate
 And then after seeing 'pink' but 'pink', i thought that i should spend a month's money in showing this film to all of them
 ek-ek seen mujhe apni jindagi se judaa lag rahaa tha
 It seemed that maybe by this show of 'pink' i would be able to change the environment around me
 karan, main tumko bataa sakuungi ki piji main sirf aaazaad hone ke liye nahin rahaa jaataa
 It makes you responsible, for yourself
 aise rahane vaali ladkiyaan 'easily available' nahin hotin
 The correct word for this is Independent
 or haa, us din lunch par jab aae the, tab undergarments baahar sukhaane par kya kaha tha tumne? kuch shame rakho
 
 
 But on your way home, clothes were seen drying out there too
 maine to ise tumhaari tameez, culture or karactor se nahin joda tha
 When i show 'pink', i will also ask my cousin that working long hours in your office means to work very hard
 to meri mehnat 'gulchharre' kisi ho sakati he
 You object to your office girls leaving home early, but why should we see you locked in the house at 7 o'clock
 vailantines de kaa wo gyaan bhi maine suna he
 
 
 Not many times, if there is a girl, then she will refuse once
 lekin sun lo
 
 
 No means neither to me
 usamen koi haa nahin chhipi
 
 phir wo kisi bhi maamle main kyon na ho
 In that New Year's party, my friend drank more and grabbed your shoulder to stave off
 or jo maine tumhaari najaron main dekha tha, vah mujhe kharaab laga
 It was something that your friends used to see when i went to the party and had a drink

Can you? - What is the secret of the bottle of wine and three glasses in Hemraj's room? - Where is the panel of the cooler that covered Hemraj's corpse on the roof?
