 chennai main 2015 main ai baadh se jaan-maal kaa baari nuksaan hua tha
 Now there is such a shortage of water in the city due to which both the people and the administration are in great difficulty
 chennai ko peyajal aapurti karne vaali chaar pramukh jhilein suukh gai hai, krishna nadi yojana se bhi raahat nahin mil pai or viraanam pariyojna shahar kii pani kii maang ko puraa karne ke liye aparyaapt sabit hui he
 The groundwater level has gone down, making Chennai now dependent on salt-separating plants from seawater
 chennai ke jal sankat kaa ek bada kaaran pani kii maang or aapurti kaa kharaab prabandhan he
 Like other cities of the country in the last century, Chennai's water demand has increased considerably due to rapid urbanization and industrial and agricultural development
 isliye, aapurti main maamuli utaar-chadhaav bhi sankat kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Chennai received 835 mm of rainfall in 2018, much lower than the average 1,400 mm and that is the root of this year's crisis
 sarkari disalination sanyantron par dhyaan kendrit karne or anya jalakshetron se pani laane se samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa
 The investment and operating costs in these plants are high and the Krishna and Cauvery rivers are also affected by water scarcity
 shahar main jal sankat ko rokane ke liye vyapak yojana kii aavashyaktaa he
 The first step may be to improve the implementation of existing laws on rainwater harvesting in Chennai
 teevr shaharikaran ke kaaran pakke raste ban rahe hai jo varshajal ko bhoomi main avasorana or bhoojal str ko phir se badaae se rokte hai
 Green space and wetlands — recharge points — must be built throughout the city
 bas stand or sadakon jaise saarvajanik sthalon par barish ke pani se bhoojal str sudhaarney ke intjaam behatar karne kii jarurat he
 Corporate firms in the city can fund these efforts as part of their corporate social responsibility programs
 ek doosraa kadam apshisht jal kaa pun: upyog hoga
 The city's lakes and rivers have been affected by sewage dumping
 apartment str ke sivej treetment system ke saath sanyukt chote treetment plant pani kaa shodhan kar sakate hai taaki adhik bhoomi kaa upyog kiye bagaiyr is pani kaa gaiyr-pine yogya prayojanon (echviasi system, bhunirmaan) main upyog kiya ja sake
 Many Indian start-ups are working on delivering such solutions with a revenue model and need encouragement from the government
 teesraa, chennai kii yojana main jhiilon or sambandhit baadh ke maidaanon kaa sangrakshan bhi shaamil hona chahie jo ki bhoojal ke pramukh punarbharan bindu hua karte hai or baadh ko rokane main bhi madad karte hai
 Flood plains were rapidly constructed and crippled Chennai to face both floods and droughts
 chennai metropolitan deveopment athurity ko aise nirmaan par tatkaal roak lagaani chahie
 And to reduce the pressure on the floodplains, they should consider promoting traffic oriented development along their banks
 bade paimaane par parivahan system ke liye land vailu capchar kii anumati den jisase rajasav paidaa hoga
 Fourth, the government should issue clear and transparent data on water resources and their uses, such as the capacity of water pipes and how much water flows from them daily
 yah visheshgyon or shikshavidon ko vichaar or suzav prastut karne main upyogi hoga
 As part of the smart city program and data initiative, Chennai needs to digitize itself to reimagine its future
 ant main, chennai ko sinchai dakshata main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 Agriculture has the highest water consumption in India and is cultivated on five lakh hectares on the Chennai River
 sinchai kshamta main sudhaar se jal sansadhano main vruddhi hogi
 We cannot expect small scale farmers to adopt high level irrigation systems
 lekin sarkaron or banking-beemaa kshetron ko nae vittiya model talashne chahie jo unhen gramin sinchai pranaaliyon main nivesh karne or use sudhaarney ke maukey paidaa kar saken
 This five-point formula will not place any additional economic burden on any stakeholder — government, farmers, city dwellers and corporate — and the living conditions will improve

 film kaa naam : partishan 1947diarector: gurinder chaddhaster cast: hu bonvil, huma kuraishi, manish dayaal, gilian anderson, om puri, raaj jutshi, darshan jarivalsevadhi:1 ghanta 46 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 2
 Gurinder Chadha, who has produced films like 5 Starbend It Like Beckham, Bride and Prejudice, has once again brought a film based on the true incident
 bharat or pakistan ke vibhaajan par bani film 'da viceroy house' jo 'freedom at midnite' naamak kitaab par besd he or ise bharat main partishan 1947 ke naam se relies kiya ja rahaa he
 Gurinder is known for his unique films
 film dekhne se pehle jaane, kisi he film kii kahani
 
 
 The story is based on the year 1945 when the British finally decided to liberate it after ruling India for 300 years
 us pal aakhri vais roy ke rup main lard mounbeton (hayu bonvil) ko bharat bheja gaya or kis tarah se bharat or pakistan kaa vibhaajan kiya jayega
 The work of determining everything started
 usee bich ek prem kahani bhi chal rahi thi joalia (huma kuraishi)or jeet singh (manish dayaal) ke bich kii thi
 But Aaliya's Abba (late Om Puri) fixed her marriage with Asif (arunoday Singh) at the behest of his late wife
 bahut saare twist terns aate hai, vibhaajan hota he or kai saare logon ke gharon ke bich se redcliff line hokar guzarati he or aakhirkaar ek sarprise bhi saamne aata he jisaki vajah se gurinder ne ye film banaai he, jiskaa pataa aapako film dekhakar hi chalegaa
 Know how the film is - the direction of the film is very good
 cinemetography or lokation bilkul swatantraaa se pehle ke bharat ko darshaate hai or vahi feel saamne aati he
 - Every character has done a great job, be it Hugh Bonville as Mountbatten or Gillian Anderson as his wife
 vahinhuma kurashine bhi bahut hi alag andaaj main abhinay kiya he
 Manish Dayal's work is quite simple
 darshan jarivaala, raaj jutshi or baaki sabhi sah kalakaar acha abhinay karte hue najar aaye hai
 On seeing Om Puri Sahab, a different feeling comes
 om puri ne film kii shooting or dabing to pehle hi kar lee thi or unhen screen par dekhte hue ye feeling aati he ki kitna bada actor hamaare bich nahin rahaa
 - This film draws attention to many issues of history
 redcliff line kii sachai, gandhi ji, nehru, jinnah ke tark or sanvaadon ko bhi film kaa hissaa banaaya gaya he
 Also, how the life of Hindu Muslim people was disturbed, it is also shown in the film
 - film kii or acchhee baat isaki length he, jo paune do ghante ke kareeb kii he or chijen sateek tareeke se aage badhati jaati hai
 - The music of the film, especially the background score is also amazing
 damaadam mast kalandar, do dilon jaise gane kahani ko aage le jate hai
 Huma Qureshi's ruckus about triple divorce: There are many people who look at many pages of history in their own style and may not attract this story to them
 khaastaur se itihaas kii taraf rujhaan rakhane waalon ko hi yah film theatre tak khinch paaegi
 - The flavor of the film is very dark, due to which the audience watching today's spice films may get bored, which is why 'partition 1947' is not for everyone
 - vibhaajan, raajnneetik samvaad or angrejon kii mansa ko puri tarah se darsha paane main bhi film kaamyaab nahin ho paayi he
 After aishwarya-deepika, Huma Qureshibox Officefilm, which became Rajinikanth's choice, has already been released in Hollywood and is now being released in India
 pehle se hi akshay kumaar kii 'toilet-ek prem katha' theatre main acchhee chal rahi he or bareli kii barfi bhi isi hafte release ho rahi he
 These reasons may affect the earnings of partition 1947

 Where the attack took place was a completely deserted place

 According to Rai, the court had recently taken cognizance in the case of making false case against Rajendra

 Earlier, Rajendra Singh had also exposed cases related to teacher recruitment scam, MNREGA and Indira Awas Yojana
 shivaprakash raay kaa kahana he ki 12 june ko unki rajendra singh se mulaakaat hui thi, tab unhone apni hatya kii ashanka jaahir kii thi
 Even before this, he had been attacked three times
 udhar, motihaari ke espi upendra sharma kaa kahana he ki police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The maternal family rivalry also seems to be because his wife has also mentioned the property dispute in the complaint given to the police

 'input IANS se The recent resignation of the Chief Minister of the social media wing of Congress, Spandanaurf Ramya, caused a lot of stir
 baad main divya ne khud aisi atakalon ko bhraamak bataa kar inhen thaamne kii koshish kii
 But if sources are to be believed, no smoke would have been raised without fire
 vaisaa hi kuch is masale ke saath he
 In fact, when Divya got the responsibility of social media in the beginning, she was also referred to the Torahul Gandhiika Twitter handle, Facebook page, Instagram and Congressparty's official Twitter handle inc india
 piem ko lekar kuch twit par aitarazlekin divya kii ore se pradhanmantri modi ko titannic jaise pos main dikhaane vaale jaise kuch aise twit aae
 In the series of questions on the party's Twitter handle, questions were raised on Nehru, so the party had to come on the backfoot
 isi tarah raakhi saavant kaa naam lekar modi par kataaksh karne vaala twit bhi divya ke khilaaf hi gaya
 It is also a fact that Divya has done many better tweets and strengthening the party on social media, but Gahe Bage has also made some childish tweets, which reduced her stature due to the questions
 kai netaaon ko nirdesh lenaa raas nahin ayiske alaava congress ke sutron kaa kahana he ki divya ne soshal media par alag- alag kshetra main party kii raay banane ke liye kai whatsap group banaaye, lekin netaaon kaa unka kai chizon par nirdeshit karnaa raas nahin aayaa
 Senior leaders like Anand Sharma, Jyotiraditya Scindia and RPN Singh left such groups on their own
 kai netaa whatsap group se baahar aesutron ke mutabik, kai netaaon ke alaava nikhil alva (margaret alva ke bete) ne divya se kaha ki vah zarurat padane par phone kar len, ye sab whatsap par sambhav nahin
 In this way, dissatisfaction within the party about Divya started increasing
 kaha to yahaan tak gaya ki aise hi banaae gaye ek group se pehle rahul or phir randeep surajevaala agsit kar gaye
 The distance created by the media wing reduced Divya's height in this way, but according to party sources, despite some childish antics, she remained in her post due to Divya's diligence, hard work and honesty
 jabaki divya ke soshal media par ulte pade daavon ke chalate party ke media vibhaag ne pehle hi unase duuri bana lee
 This was the reason that Divya was absent on such a big event of the party in Wardha
 hindi bhashi ko di gai hindi twit kii jimmedaarihalanki, rahul ke twit unase apruval lekar hi kiye jate rahe hai
 At the same time, Rahul also wanted the language of his tweet on Twitter to be something clever and such that people would be attracted and interested
 iske baad jeenyu ke chaatr or hindi main pakad rakhane vaale sandip singh ko hindi ke twitor handle kii bhashaa likhane kii zimmedaari di gayi, jo kisi vishay par rahul kii bhaavana ko apane andaaj main likhte hai, jisko pehle rahul khud apni sahmati dete hai
 Apart from this, there are requests from many states and also from the leaders that Rahul should tweet about his state or any important issue
 vahiin rahul ke twitor handle kaa angrezi kaa kaam or use rahul se anumati lene kaa kaam nikhil alva ke paas he
 Jairam stepped in, but recently, when Jairam Ramesh took over the charge of the core committee, he started coordinating every department
 kai maukon par jairam ne party ke twitor handle se koi video twit karne yaa kuch achaanak likhane ko kaha to divya uplabdh nahin raheen, to unke assistant chiraag ne aisa karne se ye kahkar manaa kar diya ki, bina divya se puche wo nahin kar sakate
 Apart from this, Jairam increased his interference in the party interest
 jairam congress ke waar room ‘15, gurudwara rakabganj’ kaa bhi cordination dekh rahe hai
 He is usually there every day and gives directions in the interest of the party when needed and he wants that to be implemented immediately
 dilli menkam vaktade raheendivyadivya kam vakt ke liye dilli rahati hai
 Divya's displeasure with Jairam's increasing interference was bound to happen
 jairam hon, sindhiya hon yaa publicity cameti ke chairman anand sharma hon, is kad ke netaaon ko divya kaa nirdeshit karnaa bhi raas nahin aayaa
 Actually, when Divya became the head of social media, she felt that this department will run on her own
 lekin pehle twitor, phir netaaon kii berukhi or kuch divya ke twit ne unki mushkilen badha deen, jisase unki bhoomika simit ho gai
 Jayaram increasing pressure? Divya, who came into politics from acting in films, is currently looking at Rahul's Facebook page, inc india's handle and Rahul's Instagram account
 rahul ke twitor handle kii badi lokapriyata ke baad ab divya se fasebuk pej lekar kisi or ko dene kii charchaa chal nikali
 But right now the matter is stuck here
 lekin jairam kaa sidhaa dakhal jarur divya ko sirdard de rahaa he, kyonki jahaan purv saansad divya rahul ke kareebi hone kaa daawa karti raheen, jo congressiyon ko raas nahin aayaa
 But Jairam, who took over the war room of the party during 2004, himself is working directly with the mandate from Rahul, in such a situation the pressure is bound to increase

 'mammaj Boys' features Neena Gupta as Kunti
 is short film ko utyub par do din main hi 2 lakh, 80 hajaar se zyada darshak mil chuke hai

 chakrapani ke mutabik unhone apane sanghathan ke logon ko film se jude sabhi logon ke khilaaf exiaar darj karaane ke liye kaha he
 Chakrapani said, 'whoever made the film, who worked in it, has made the sum of all those going to jail

 He said that the purpose of making our film is not to hurt the feelings of any religion

 ' Iraqi forces have surrounded Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State (ISIS), the world's most feared terrorist organization
 use kabhi bhi pakadaa ja saktaa he
 But the important thing is that Baghdadi is alive or dead amidst the news of death and reports of poisoning several times
 isse pehle uske khaane main jehar milaane ke baad uski haalat gambhir ho gai thi
 He was being treated by placing him in an undisclosed location
 is ghatana ke baad se iesas ke aatanki baukhalaaye hue the
 They were searching for poisoners
 yah koi pehali baar nahin he ki jab bagdadi se judi is tarah kii sansanikhej khabar saamne ai ho
 Even before this, there have been reports of his death about four times
 haal hi main 9 june 2016 ko khabar ai ki kaaron ke ek kafile main chup kar syria se rakka jate samay bagdadi par bam gira diya gaya or uski maut ho gai
 Know when and when Baghdadi's death was the first death: September 6, 2014 was the date when Baghdadi's first death occurred
 ye wo vakt tha jab ek british patrkaar kaa galaa kaatane kii tasviren camere par ricard kar bagdadi ne puri duniya ko dikhaaya tha
 Then, for the first time, the face of ISIS had seen its dark face
 isi ke baad ek hawaii hamale main bagdadi ke pehle ghayal hone or phir mare jane kii khabar ai, lekin is khabar ke saamne aane ke kareeb maheene bhar baad 13 november 2014 ko bagdadi kaa audio saamne aa gaya or usne khud kii maut ko jhuthla diya
 Second death: 27 April 2015 About six months after the first death, the news of Baghdadi's second death came from the Golan Heights area of syria
 is baar bhi bagdadi ke pehle gathjod sena ke hawaii hamale main ghayal hone kii khabar ai
 Radio Iran then claimed Baghdadi died on 27 April at an Israeli hospital in the Golan Heights area of syria
 do iraqi news agenciyon algaad press auki al-yum al-tamen kaa bhi yahi daawa tha, lekin kareeb teen maheene baad july 2015 main bagdadi ke zindaa hone kaa saboot phir se saamne aa gaya
 Third death: October 12, 2015 The news came that Baghdadi was badly injured in the airstrike of the us-led army opening a front against ISIS
 daawa kiya gaya ki hamale ke vakt bagdadi apane kuch saathiyon ke saath iraq or syria border ke najadik ek gumnaam thikaane par ja rahaa tha
 While Baghdadi was injured in this air raid on a ISIS convoy, three of his companions were killed, but within a month the news of this third death of Baghdadi also came out false
 chauthi maut: 9 june 20169 june 2016 kii shaam ko america kii aguai vaali gathjod sena ko khabar milti he ki iesas kaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi kuch duusare bade cmanderon ke saath kaaron ke ek kafile main chup kar syria se rakka ja rahaa he
 As soon as the news is received, the alliances army gets alerted immediately
 satellite kii madad se rakka kii tasviren hasil kii jaati hai or phir mubir kii khabar kii tasdik hote hi thik us jagah par aasmaan se bam giraaya jaataa he, jahaan se bagdadi kii kaaron kaa kafila guzarane kii baat kahi gai thi
 Who is Abu Bakr al-baghdadi Baghdadi is the chief of the terrorist organization ISIS
 wo abu musaab al-jarakavi kii maut ke baad sanghathan kaa chif bana
 On June 29, 2014, Baghdadi captured most of Iraq and Syria and declared itself an Islamic state, declaring itself a Muslim caliph
 isaki pahchaan sanghathan main battle field commander or technitian ke rup main he
 Experts say that young terrorists are greatly influenced by Baghdadi
 bagdadi islamic studies main piechdi he

 World Sleep Day 2019: duniyabar main har saal 15 march ko world sleep de manaaya jaataa he
 The theme of World Sleep Day this year is 'healthy Sleep and Healthy Aging'

 Unhealthy lifestyle, diet, stress along with less sleep are also responsible for weight gain
 health export ke mutabik, neend kii kami se sharir ke ghrelin or leptin hormones par asar padataa he
 Hunger is felt more when the hormone is released in the body
 ye hormone metabolism ko kamjor karata he or sharir main fat jamaa karata he
 At the same time, leptin hormone is released from the body's fat cells
 ye hormone ko bhukh ko kam karata he
 Due to the formation of low levels of leptin hormone in the body, the appetite increases, due to which you eat excessively
 ye aapkaa vajan badhaane kaa kaam karata he
 Let me tell you, due to lack of sleep, the level of leptin hormone in the body decreases and the level of Ghrelin hormone increases
 isaki vajah se aapako zyada bhukh lagati he
 Excessive eating causes weight gain
 neend kii kami ke kaaran vajan badhane ke saath, dimag or sehat par bhi bahut bura asar padataa he
 Therefore, if you want to keep your weight under control, then definitely take 7-8 hours of sleep

 'RJD ke 16, JDU ke 15, congress ke 5 mantrinithish ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha ki vah 14 november ko apane mantrimandal kii aakhri baithak ke baad rajya vidhansabha ko bhang karne kii sifarish karenge
 He also said that on the same day, after the joint meeting of the grand alliance, he will stake claim for formation of a new government
 shapath grahan samaaroh main RJD ke 16, JDU ke 15 or congress ke paanch mantri shapath lenge
 Unilateral victory for Mahagathbandhan According to JDU leaders, after Chhath Puja, Nitish will once again take oath of Chief Minister along with 36 members of the Council of Ministers
 gauratlab he ki bihar vidhansabha chunaav main mahagathbandhan ne bijepi kii aguwai vaale NDA ko maat di thi
 The RJD emerged as the single largest party in this election by securing 80 assembly seats
 vahiin, JDU ko 71 or congress ko 27 siten hasil hui
 Input: IANS gujarat vidhansabha chunaav kii ek seat ke liye bijepi or congress ke bich jo takkar dekhne ko mili or jis tarah se antim samay tak suspence kaa maahaul bana rahaa usne kaante kii takkar vaale cricket maichon ke romaanch ko bhi peeche chhod diya
 However, the manner in which Ahmed Patel won in the most difficult election of his life has given a big blow to BJP especially President Amit Shah's Chanakya policy
 gujarat main rajyasabha chunaav kii teen siton ke liye chunaav hone the
 According to the number force in the assembly, two seats were decided by the BJP and one seat in the Congress account
 bijepi ne in do siton par amit shah or smriti irani ko ummidavaar banaaya or congress kii ore se sonia gandhi ke raajnneetik sachiv or gandhi parivaar ke baad party ke sabase kaddavar chehre ahamed patel ko utaara gaya
 The victory of these candidates was supposed to be decided but the game changed when Shankar Singh Vaghela left the Congress
 iske baad party ke chah vidhayak baagi hokar bijepi main chale gaye
 The Congress sensed that it was a conspiracy not to allow Ahmed Patel to go to the Rajya Sabha again and she hurriedly went to Karnataka with her 44 mlas
 maamle main dilachasp mode tab aayaa jab karnataka ke jis resort main ye vidhayak ruke hue the, usapar iskar vibhaag ne chapa maar diya
 The echo of this raid was heard even in Parliament
 congress ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi ahamed patel ko haraane ke liye har daanv chal rahi he
 First its mlas were bought and now efforts are being made to intimidate them with income tax loopholes
 yahi nahin karnataka main congress ke keval 44 vidhayak pahunche yani party ke 7 or vidhayak baagi ho gaye
 The Congress still needed another MLA to win as the victory figure was 45 mlas
 haalanki do baagi congressiyon ke vot radd hone se ahamed patel kii jeet ke liye 44 vot hi paryaapt the
 JDU-NCP MLA became the game changerin another big controversy among all also in Bihar
 vahaan mahagathbandhan tut gaya or nitish kumaar lalu yadav kaa saath chhodkar bijepi ke saathi ban gaye
 BJP also saw its advantage in Gujarat as Chhotu Basava, an MLA from JDU in Gujarat
 bijepi aashwast thi ki chotu basaava kaa vot use hi milegaa
 The party too had convinced him but Chhotu Basava said that he had voted for Ahmed Patel
 yahi nahin, gujarat kii vidhansabha main ensipi ke bhi do vot hai
 Both BJP and Congress were eyeing these votes
 donon main se jiske khate main ye vot jate uski jeet takreeban tay thi lekin ensipi ke donon vidhayakon ne alag-alag partiyon ko vot diya
 That is, the Congress got one vote of NCP and the other vote for BJP
 yani yahaan bijepi ensipi ko donon vot paane main vifal rahi or ahamed patel kii jeet tay ho gai
 There was no bjp-congress competition in Gujarat, it was clear from the situation that the BJP set in these Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat that this contest is not going to be a contest of just two parties, but behind it personal of BJP President Amit Shah and Congress leader Ahmed Patel
 There is also feud
 pichley kuch dinon ke ghatnakram ko dekha jaae to ye saaf he kiahamad patel ko haraane ke liebijapi ne har sambhav koshish kii
 Even at the last moment when the matter reached the Election Commission, BJP sent six of its Union Ministers to the Commission
 wo bhi ek baar nahin balki teen ghante main teen baar
 But despite this, the decision went in favor of Patel and Amit Shah had to face the biggest political defeat of his recent times with his biggest political rival

 IANS se input Famous actors of South Indian films Kamal Haasan have already announced to enter politics
 ab 21 farvari se unka tamilnadu kaa daura shuru hoga
 Which is named ‘nalai Namadhi’ (tomorrow is ours)
 bataa den ki isse pehle wo 26 janvari se apana daura shuru karne ja rahe the, lekin ab wo 21 farvari se shuru karenge
 Recently, Kamal Haasan, through his weekly column in a Tamil magazine, tried to help the people of Tamil community
 unhone kollam main likhaa ki main raajnneeti ke jariye apane kartavya ko nibhaa rahaa hum
 First i will meet my loved ones, but it will not be like a celebrity party
 unhone kaha ki party kaa naam or uski disha kaa elaan 21 farvari ko kiya jayega
 Kamal Haasan also mentioned former President APJ Abdul Kalam, Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi in his column
 isse itare unhone apane kollam main apane sangharsh kii baat kii or khud ko tamil asmita se joda
 Haasan, meanwhile, associated himself with the Tamil people in gestures
 gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki rajnikant mul rup se tamil nahin hai, vah marathi hai
 Kamal said during this time that his family is going to follow Gandhi's ideas
 bataa den ki abhinayta rajnikant ne ek raajnneetik dal banane or agle vidhansabha chunaav main tamilnadu main sabhi 232siton par chunaav ladane kii ichha jataai he
 One of the criteria to decide whether a smartphone is better or not is its speed and performance
 yani vah smartphone kitna fast he or dusron ke mukaable processing kitni fast he
 Apple has always been ahead in this matter
 is baar aipal ne iphone x ke main nayaa procesar lagaaya he jiskaa naam A11 bionic chipset rakhaa gaya he
 It can be said to be the fastest processor offered in any smartphone
 aisa isliye kyonki ismenggheekbenchh par kiye gaye quick ran main yah smartfonduniya bhar ke smartphone ke muqablefast he or list main number van he
 Geekbench is a processor benchmarking program
 yah procesar kii speed kii jaanch karne ke liye kai test karata he
 In general terms, the sooner the test completes, the faster the CPU of that smartphone will be called
 pichhali baar ke mukaable is baar ke iphon x ne benchmark par zyada score kiya he
 The A11 bionic chipset is almost double in terms of a single core compared to Apple's older A10 Fusion chip
 ab aapako bataa den ki philhal Snapdragon 835 or Exynos 8895 octacor processors kisi bhi android smartfones main die jane vaale sabase fast procesar maane jate hai
 But the A11 Bionic processor given in the new iphone has left them behind
 single kor or multi kor test donon main hi is procesar ne baaji maari he
 Apple's chipsets generally lag behind in multicore tests, but this time the A11 Bionic chipset has seen a lot of improvement
 Apple A11 bionic procesar main chah kor lagaae gaye hai
 Two of these are high power cores while four are power efficient
 sabase badi khaasiyat ye he ki ye sabhi kor ek saath kaam karne main sakasham hai jo smartphone ko fast banane main bada yogadan detaa he
 Photo Credit - GSM Arena There are only a handful of smartphones that compete the iphone x in the current market, such as Galaxy S8 Plus, Galaxy Note 8, One Plus 5 and HTC U11
 inamen die jane vaale procesar ke mukaable iphone X, iphone 8 or iphone 8 Plus kaa procesar kaaphi fast he
 Now it will be interesting to see whether Google puts which processor in its Flugaship smartphone which is launching on October 4
 iphone x ke procesar ke multi kor test kii baat karen to isane 10,069 score kiya he jabaki Galaxy Note 8 ke procesar ne 6,784 score kiya
 Talking about the single core test, the iphone x scored 4,188 while the iphone 7 Plus scored 3,473
 gauratlab he ki in sabhi hai smartphone ke mukaable iphone x kaa ram sabase kam he
 Because the Galaxy Note 8 has 6GB of RAM while the iphone x has 3GB of RAM
 haalanki company ne iske bare main bataaya nahin he ye report ke aadhaar par he
 Apart from the fast processor, the iphone x also has a lot that will make it a killer smartphone
 haalanki isaki keemat bharat ke lihaaj se zyada he or america ke mukaable bharat main yah lagbhag 40 fisadi mahangaa milegaa

 com / sjldg7u95c After Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the idea of holding the Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections together, the Law Ministry has suggested a different view on the issue from legal and other angles
 loksabhaa chunaav evam vidhansabha chunaav saath saath karaae jane ke vichaar ko amali jama pahanaae jane se pehle jab ham kanoonee pahalu par vichaar karenge to usamen samvidhan sanshodhan bhi shaamil hoga or is sanshodhan ko sansad main paarit karana anivaary hoga
 The ministry has divided the issue into two parts for consideration in a note sent to the highest level of the government
 kanoon mantralay kii sthaayee sansadeey samiti ne pichley saal disambar main apni report main loksabhaa or rajyasabha chunaav saath saath karaae jane kii sifarish kii thi
 The Law Ministry then sought its views from the Election Commission
 ayog ne is vichaar kaa samarthan karte hue spasht kiya ki is par kharch adhik aayegaa or kuch rajya vidhansabhaon kaa kaarykaal badhaane yaa ghataane ke liye samvidhan main sanshodhan karnaa padegaa
 However, after analyzing the report of the Standing Committee and the Election Commission's side, the Law Ministry has divided the issue into two parts
 ek ke tahat kanoonee pahalu ko rakhaa gaya he or duusare main avasanrachana, vittiya or anya paksh shaamil hai
 In its reply to the Law Ministry in May, the Election Commission said that it supports the proposal but it would cost more than Rs 9,000 crore
 ‘‘loksabhaa evam rajya vidhansabhaon ke chunaav saath saath karaane kii vyavhaaryata’’ par report dene vaali sansadeey sthaayee samiti ke samaksh ayog ne kathinaaiyon kaa zikr kiya
 The commission told the government and the committee that electronic voting machines and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trial (VVPAT) machines would have to be purchased on a large scale to conduct simultaneous elections
 ayog ne kaha ki loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav saath saath karaane ke liye iviem or vivipieti mashine kharidne ke vaaste 9,284
 15 crore rupees will be needed
 sansadeey samiti ne chunaav ayog ke hawaale se kaha ‘‘mashiinon ko har 15 saal main badalane kii jarurat hogi jis par phir bada kharch aayegaa
 Apart from this, a huge amount will also be spent on the maintenance of these machines
 ’’ nirvachan sambandhi kanoon ke anusaar, sadan kaa kaarykaal samaapt hone se chah maah purv chunaav karaae ja sakate hai or sadan kaa kaarykaal apatkaal kii adhisuchana ko chhod kar anya maamalon main nahin badhaayaa ja saktaa
 To bring it in line with the tenure of the Lok Sabha, the term in the Houses of the State Legislatures can be either increased or reduced and this will require amendments in Articles Three and Four of the Constitution
 tippaniyan The situation may also come when President's rule is applicable in the state or no confidence motion is passed against the governments

 Terming fair justice as his first priority, General Deepak Kapoor reiterated that defense forces are the only organizations where swift judicial action is taken as soon as any irregularities are found
 unhone kaha, ‘‘bahari vichaar vimarsh yaa media ke dabaav main nyaay nahin kiya jayega

 There has been a new twist in the controversy over the appointment of Lokayukta in UP for a month
 pradesh sarkaar ne lokayukta sanshodhan vidheyak paarit karwaakar lokayukta kii niyukti main elahabaad hai court ke chif justise kii bhoomik khatm kar di he
 That is, according to the new rule, in addition to the Chief Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, the Lokayukta Selection Committee will consist only of the Speaker of the Assembly and a retired judge from the Supreme Court or High Court
 mahinebhar ke andar chaar baar lokayukta niyukti kii file lautne ke badaupi sarkaarne ek baar phir gend rajyapal ke paale main daal di he, vahiin nae niyam ke tahat ritred jaj kaa naam bhi samiti ke adhyaksh yani siem or vidhansabha adhyaksh baatcheet kar tay karenge
 This new amendment is being considered as an attempt by the government to make it the Lokayukta of its choice
 isse pehle ritred justise rabindra singh ke naam par hai court ke chif justise divai chandrachud ne aapatti jataai thi
 Obviously, due to the overwhelming majority of the Samajwadi Party, all the figures in the house are in its favor and the government has benefited directly from it
 lekin aanan fanan main laae gaye is sanshodhan vidheyak se vipaksh main baari naaraazgi he
 Though the opposition leader from the main opposition party BSP had earlier approved the name of Justice Ravindra Singh as Lokayukta, but he is also seen to be quite stunned by the sudden amendment bill and changes in the selection procedure rules
 upi main loksabhaa upachunaav ke liye bahujan samaaj party or samaajawaadee party ke bich gathbandhan par tippanee karte hue purv sapa netaa amar singh ne tikhi pratikriya di he
 Amar Singh said that how could his father be an alliance partner with BSP supremo Mayawati Jail
 unhone kaha he ki agar mayawati rajyasabha ke liye nahin jeet paati hai, to akhilesh ko juute maarengi
 Let us tell you that the BSP supremo has indirectly supported the Samajwadi Party for the Lok Sabha by-elections in Nagorakhpur and Phulpur
 donon siton par voting se kuch din pehle lakhanu main press conference karte hue mayawati ne kaha tha ki loksabhaa upachunaav main basapa kaa koi ummidavaar maidan main nahin he
 Therefore, to defeat the BJP, the party has decided to support the candidate first, who can defeat the BJP
 haalanki mayawati ne is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki unhone ye kadam vipaksh ke saath 'ek haath len or duusare haath den' ke tahat kiya he
 Under this, all parties including SP and Congress in UP will have to support the BSP Rajya Sabha candidate
 vahiin, madhya pradesh ke chunaavon main basapa congress kaa samarthan karegi
 Amar Singh, who arrived in Lucknow on Tuesday, was reacting to the same SP-BSP coordination
 kabhi mulaayam singh ke behad kareebi rahe amar singh ne sapa kii rajyasabha ummidavaar jaya bachchan par kii gai bijepi netaa naresh agarwal kii tippanee par bhi apni pratikriya di
 He said that i do not like Jaya Bachchan at all, but the insult she has been given is wrong
 naachne vaala kahana to nataraj shiv kaa bhi apmaan he
 Amar Singh said that Naresh Agarwal wants to grow up like Mani Shankar
 taili or chywala kehane vaale log bijepi main ja rahe hai
 This is a big heart for Modiji, who forgets them all
 jab unhone smriti irani ko mantrimandal main shaamil kar liya, jinhone gujarat cond main unke khilaaf pradarshan kiya, to naresh agarwal bhi khap jaaenge
 Provided they live properly

 congress ne loksabhaa chunaav ke liye gorakhpur seat se apane ummidavaar kaa elaan kar diya he
 The Congress, which is looking for a comeback in Gorakhpur, a BJP stronghold, has once again played the stakes on the Brahmin face here
 congress ne yahaan se madhusudan tiwari ko tikat diya he
 Madhusudan Tiwari is pitted against bjp's Brahmin candidate Ravi Kishan Shukla and SP-BSP alliance candidate Rambhual Nishad
 peshey se vakil madhusudan tiwari uttar pradesh baar council ke sadsy hai
 He has the responsibility of once again returning the Congress to this important seat of Purvanchal on his shoulder
 congress isse pehle jab aakhri baar gorakhpur seat jiti thi tab brahman ummidavaar madan pandey ne jeet hasil kii thi
 Madan Pandey was the last Congressman to win this seat in the 1984 election
 madhusudan ke saamne chauthe sthaan se upar laana chunauticongress gorakhpur main haal ke do chunaavon main bhi brahman chehre par daanv lagaai thi
 In the 2014 elections, Congress gave ticket to Ashtabhuja Prasad Tripathi from here
 haalanki modi lahar main wo koi kamaal nahin kar sake or 45 hajaar 719 voton ke saath chauthe sthaan par the
 Earlier in the 2009 elections, the Congress placed bets on the Nishad candidate for the Nishad vote bank, but his bet failed this time too
 is baar lalchand nishad 30 hajaar 262 voton ke saath chauthe sthaan par the
 Earlier in the 2004 elections, the Congress nominated Sharadendu Pandey
 congress kaa brahman daanv is baar bhi fail rahaa or shardendu pandey 33 hajaar 477 voton ke saath chauthe sthaan par rahe
 If we look at the last few election results, the challenge will be to bring the Congress above the fourth position in front of Madhusudan Tiwari
 kyonki 2004, 2009 or 2014 ke chunaav main party har baar chauthe sthaan par hi rahi he
 In two of these elections, his Brahmin bet was also failing
 aise main is baar dekhne vaali baat hogi ki madhusudan tiwari kya kamaal kar sakate hai, wo bijepi ke brahman pratyaashee ravi kishan shukla kaa khel bigaadte hai yaa phir sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke pratyaashee rambhual nishad kii raah rokte hai
 Who will go with Brahmin voters? There are close to 2 lakh Brahmin voters in Gorakhpur
 yahaan ke brahman matadaata aamtaur par bijepi ko apni pasand maanate hai
 The BJP nominated Upendra Shukla as its candidate in the 2018 by-election, seeing the Brahmin vote bank, but his bet failed and Pravin Nishad, who contested on the SP ticket, won
 haalanki praveen nishad ab bijepi main hai or santakabeernagar se bijepi ke pratyaashee hai
 The Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat is called the stronghold of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 2018 ke upachunaav ko chhod den to beete 21 saal main ye pehla chunaav he jab yogi adityanath ummidavaar nahin hai
 After winning for the first time in 1998, only here and only Yogi Adityanath's magic has gone
 yogi adityanath kii is jeet main brahman matadaataaon ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 In such a situation, the thing that will be seen this time will be with whom the Brahmin voters go
 kya ve bijepi ke saath bane rahenge yaa congress ko raahat kii khabar pahunchaayenge

 The government today introduced the bill in the Lok Sabha despite the objections of some parties
 congress or makapa ne vidheyak ko anaavashyak or jaldibaji main laayaa gaya bataate hue sarkaar se ise waapas lene or baad main samgr vidheyak laane kii maang bhi kii
 Responding to the discussion on the Bill, Labor and Employment Minister Bandaru Dattatreya said in the House that the provision to increase overtime with amendments to provisions 64 and 65 in the Bill is not mandatory and is voluntary
 unhone kaha ki kaarkaane main kaam karne vaala karmchaaree tay karegaa ki use overtime karnaa he yaa nahin
 Dattatreya said that the need of the hour was to bring the related amendments to the bill because the government's ambitious plans 'digital India', 'make in India' and 'skill India' etc
 would require huge manpower to increase investment
 tippaniyan He said that these amendments were urgently needed and later the overall bill would be brought in the House

 The Congress and the CPI-M also demanded the government to withdraw the bill and later bring the composite bill, stating that the bill was unnecessary and hurried
 vidheyak par hui charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue shram or rojgaar mantri bandaaru dattatreya ne sadan main kaha ki vidheyak main upbandh 64 or 65 main sanshodhan ke saath overtime badhaane kaa praavdhaan anivaary nahin he or svaichhik he
 He said that the worker working in the factory will decide whether he has to work overtime
 dattatreya ne kaha ki vidheyak main sambandhit sanshodhan laana samay kii jarurat isliye thi kyonki sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi yojanaon ‘digital india’, ‘mek in india’ or ‘skill india’ aadi ke lihaaj se nivesh badhaane ke liye badi shramashakti chahie hogi
 The comments unhone kaha ki ye sanshodhan tatkaal jaruri the or baad main samgr vidheyak ko sadan main laayaa jayega

 ) Welcoming the decision of the United Nations Security Council to declare the leader of Pakistan-based terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed as a global terrorist, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday that it was a diplomatic victory of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ne fasebuk par ek post main likhaa he ki aaj bharat ko aatankwaad ke kilaaf ladaai main badi ahm kamyaabi mili he jab United Nations Security Council (UNSC) ne pakistan sthit or vahaan se samarthit aatank‬vaadi sanghathan, ‘jaish-e-mohammad' ke sargana masood ajahar ko ‘global Terrorist' ghoshit kar diya he
 He has said that India has been making diplomatic efforts for this in the United Nations for almost a decade
 aaj bharat ko yah badi kamyaabi mil gai he
 This step of the United Nations will prove to be very helpful in punishing Masood Azhar and his organization for the crimes and crimes committed by them in the country
 singh ne kaha he ki bharat ko mili is kootnithik safalataa kaa shrey hamaare pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kootneeti kaushal evam aatankwaad ke kilaaf unke dwaara uthaae gaye anek prabhavi qadamon ko jaataa he
 Apart from this, in the tweets made by Silesilewar, Rajnath Singh has described Masood Azhar's declaration as a global terrorist, a major success in the fight against India's terrorism
 kya pashchim bengal main badla jayega itihaas
 The people of Bengal will make the Left Front, which has been in power for 35 years, ousted from power
 ajtak, hedlins, oarji survey ne pashchim bengal main sabhi charnon ke matdaan ke baad taiyaar kii he bengal kii postpol tasviir is tasviir main mamata apane virodhiyon se kaaphi aage dikh rahi hai jabaki vammorcha kaa kila tuutata dikh rahaa he
 According to the Aaj tak-headlines-org survey, the Left Front can get 65 to 70 seats in the post poll
 inhen 39 fisadi vot mil saktaa he
 According to Postpol, the Left Front lost 160 seats, while its vote percentage fell by 9 percent
 2006 vidhansabha ke mutabik vammorcha ko 294 main se 227 seat milin thim jabaki uskaa vot pratishat 48 fisadi tha
 If you look at the complete picture in this way, according to Postpol in 2011, the Left Front can get 65 to 70 seats, it will get 39 per cent votes, it will lose 160 seats with 9 per cent votes whereas in 2006 it won 227 seats with 48 per cent votes
 
 is tarah se ajtak-hedlins-oarji post survey ke mutabik left kaa laal garh dhahtaa dikh rahaa he or mamata banerjee, congress or anya kii sarkaar banati dikh rahi he
 If the figures are understood, then Mamata Banerjee alliance can get 210 to 220 seats
 gathbandhan ko 48 fisadi mat mil sakate hai
 The Mamata coalition seems to gain 186 seats, while the vote share of the alliance has increased by 19 percent
 2006 vidhansabha main mamata ko bijepi ke saath 29 fisadi vot or 30 seat milin thim jabaki congress ko 17 fisadi vot ke saath 21 seat milin thim
 But in 2011, both are together, so the complete picture that is generated by the post poll is that the alliance will get 210 to 220 seats, they can get 48 percent of the vote
 inhen 2006 kii apeksha 186 seat kaa phayda ho saktaa or unka vot pratishat kareeb 19 fisadi bad saktaa he
 It is clear in this way that Mamata Banerjee is looking to win big with her alliance
 yani bengal main ek bade aitihaasik badlaav ke sanket do tihaai se zyada ke bahumat se saaf hai
 There are indications about the remaining seats in the survey that the other 6 per cent of the votes can be held on 16 seats which will be 26 seats less than the last time and the vote percentage may be reduced by 10 per cent
 is tarah se mamata satta par kabiz dikhti hai or left satta se baahar

 On December 12, Sidhu had presented this straw filled black pheasant to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh
 yah pakshi siddhu ko ek pakistani patrkaar ne tab bhent kiya tha jab vah kartapur galiyare kii neenv rakhane ke samaaroh main bhaag lene pakistan gaye the
 After returning home after attending the ceremony, Navjot Singh Siddhup had gone to meet the Chief Minister last week, where he had given the gift

 There is no doubt that for the last seven decades, India and Pakistan have come face to face on the issue of Kashmir
 hamane baatcheet bhi kii
 They also fought wars
 zakhm bhi khaae
 Wounds were also given
 magar kashmir ke mudde par kabhi kisi tisare kii madhyasthata sweekaar nahin kii
 But the current situation of Pakistan is such that it needs the US to improve its crumbling economy
 or america ko duniya ke saamne apni choudharahat dikhaane kaa bahaanaa
 And on this pretext, US President Donald Trump jumped into the Kashmir issue
 ab sawaal ye ki begaani shaadi main akhir abdulla bevajaah divaana kyon hua
 Trump has once again intervened on the Kashmir issue
 kashmir main madhyasthata ke liye trump betaab hai! kashmir par unhone mazahab kaa 'trump' card khelaa he
 There is a great old saying, Abdullah Deewana in Begani wedding
 is kahawat ko sach hote suniye bhi or dekh bhi lijie
 The Government of India spoke in Parliament
 videsh mantri es
 Jaishankar spoke to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Bangkok personally
 khud white house ne bol diya
 But one simple thing US President Donald Trump does not understand
 kashmir main dhara 370 bharat kaa aantarik or kashmir samasya dwipaksheeya maamla he
 There is no scope to be absorbed in this
 lekin america raashtrapati donald trump kashmir masale par madhyasthata karne ke liye betaab hue ja rahe hai
 Now this is the third time when Trump has chanted to mediate in Kashmir
 kul milakar america ke raashtrapati sahab ye kahana chaahate hai ki jo samasya 70 saal se hal nahin ho pai he
 They will solve it in a pinch
 darasal, trump bina fees kaa vakil banane kii koshish isliye kar rahe hai
 Because they have to establish America's dominance over the world
 uske liye trump koi bhi bayana dene ko taiyaar hai
 Yes, Pakistan has given him the courage to speak so much
 or ab ek baar phir duniya trump kii is peshkash ko bevajaah kaa bayaan maan rahi he
 Owaisi has given him the exact answer, despite the BJP being a million-strong
 jo shaayad bharat aadhikarik taur nahin de paata
 Hindustan may not consider America as something, but Pakistan is in front of it
 duniyabar se dutkaar milane ke baad ab use trump se hi ummid nazar aa rahi he
 But let us tell you that this same US refused to support Pakistan in the UN Security Council
 itihaas khangaalenge to paaenge ki america har taraf sirf apana hit sadhta he
 At present, Pakistan is financially now fully dependent on the US
 udhar, dakshin asia or khaskar china par dabadabe ke liye america ne afghanistan par kabja jamaa rakhaa he or wo ise chhodana nahin rahaa he
 Therefore, he does not want to offend both countries at this time
 trump ke bayaan ko halke main nahin liya janaa chahie
 Because just a few days ago, Trump had talked to Modi for half an hour
 or iske fouran baad unhone imran khan ko phone mila diya tha
 Overall, Trump wants to present an image that he can resolve the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan if both are ready
 magar raashtrapati trump shaayad ye bhul gaye ki kashmir bharat kaa abhinn hissaa he
 India's line regarding Kashmir is clear
 kisi tisare paksh ko kabuula nahin jayega
 Kashmir falls in the three largest conflict zones in the world
 north or south korea kii ladaai main to america ghusaa hi hua
 He is also involved in the conflict between Israel and Palestine
 or ab wo kisi tarah kashmir ke sangharsh main bhi shaamil hona chahta he taaki duniya ko dikhaa sake ki sabase bada choudhary vahi he
 Trumps do not fall apart if they have to lie for this
 raashtrapati donald trump kaarobaar kii duniya se america raashtrapati kii kursi tak pahunche hai
 They weigh everything on the scale of profit and loss
 unke taur-tareekon kii vajah se unhen america tak main bhi gambhirtha se nahin liya jaataa
 The American newspapers often give their own daily lying figures
 aise main raashtrapati trump kii kootneeti baarikiyon or gambhirtha ko dekhte hue hi bharat ne shaayad ab tak trump ke bayaan par koi aadhikarik pratikriya nahin jataai he
 However, at the G7 conference in France this week, PM Modi will meet Donald Trump
 ummid he ki pradhanmantri modi
 
 america raashtrapati ko bharat kii kashmir niti saaf kar denge

 main tumhen chabana chaahati hum,’ usne kaha
 She was sweetie, her lips were magenta red
 sweety ne use chandan kii khushboo se mahakati apni baahon main bhar rakhaa tha
 She used sandalwood soap of Mysore daily to preserve the fragrance
 wo is khushboo ko kaaphi pasand karata tha lekin aaj usee khushboo main uskaa dam ghut rahaa tha
 Sweetie was unbuttoning the buttons of his shirt, yet he wanted to push it away
 ‘tum dar kyon rahe ho, kya baat he?’ sweety ne uski ankhon main sach dhundhate hue kaha
 'come on,' she tried to kiss her eyes while covering herself
 sweety ko aise maasoom lav shots nahin, tufaani kism kii muhabbat kii chahat thi
 'let me kiss your chest
 duniya ko pataa chal jane do ki babu meri property he,’ apni baahon ko uski qamar par kasate hue or uski shart kaa batan kholte hue sweety ne ek saans main kaha
 He lowered Sweetie down, climbed on top of her and opened her trouser
 genes ke andar se jhaankta uske jocky kaa band doodh kii tarah safed tha
 'your underwear has changed
 tum bhi badal gaye ho
 Babu, you are hiding something, 'sweetie said amidst mild opposition
 usne apane bade hont uski lips par laga die
 His lips were cold as ice
 donon ne ek duusare kii hatheliyaan bheench leen
 Sweetie was feeling her tension with a drop of sweat in her palm
 sweety ne use peeth se pakadaa or pani kii laharon kii tarah uske upar aa gai
 Sweetie was on him at this time
 venity vine main bade mirar ke chaaron taraf kii lite unke chehre par gir rahi thi
 His skin was white towards the milky light of the moon
 sweety ne uske puure chehre ko kis kiya or uski shart ke batan kholane lagi
 'why are you not letting me unbutton your shirt? tum itnaa ajeeb bartaav kyon kar rahe ho babu
 What's wrong with you, 'sweetie's suspicion grew from her opposition
 ab use pakkaa yakeen ho gaya ki koi baat zarur he
 Sweetie tightly grabbed her shirt and quickly opened the button
 ‘thodaa khinchaav he
 This gym too
 uhhahahahahah,’ bahaanaa bataane hue usne kaha
 'you're lying,' Sweetie attacked directly
 ‘kya main apane babu se pyaar bhi nahin kar sakati? kya iske liye mujhe parmishan leni hogi?’ sweety ne bechaini se kaha
 Sweety was very sexy
 uski sex apil uski chin se chhan chhanakar tapakati thi
 Anger used to increase her sex appeal
 ‘maar daalo mujhe
 Take off my jeans, 'it was request or order, he was not even sure about it
 sweety use ghur rahi thi
 'move ahead
 meri genes utaar do
 'his words shook Sweetie
 uski awaz kaanp rahi thi
 Sweetie stared into his eyes
 uski ankhen lite brown thim
 It is said that dating with light brown eyes is quite risky
 sweety ne ab tak sirf vahi kiya tha jo riski tha
 She backed away
 usne apni baanhen uske peeche se hataa leen
 The boy adjusted his head with a small pillow in the vanity van
 wo jaanata tha ki sweety uski genes utaar degi or use player main bhigo degi
 Sweetie closed her buttons
 usne bhi aasaani se sarender kar diya
 In a few seconds, he put on his shirt
 wo jaanati thi ki us shart ke andar kuch chipa he
 Then suddenly Sweety leapt like a dangerous leopard and tore off his entire shirt
 uski nazar uske seene par padi
 That stag chaunki or nishshabd ho gai
 He had a tattoo on his chest
 usamen naam guda tha
 That name was of a girl
 wo ladki sweety nahin thi
 She was Anu
 tatu ekadam tazaa tha
 The skin was green because of the tattoo, the wound was red
 uski life main ek or ladki he
 Sweetie punched him hard on his nose
 naak par mukka padane se puraa sharir hill jaataa he or kaaphi takalif detaa he
 He was deeply hurt by this punch and started bleeding
 usne sweety se explene karnaa chaha lekin sweety usase dur ho gai
 Sweetie was shocked
 sweety usase bahut pyaar karti thi
 Maybe even hate
 donon imoshan aansu kii shakl main baahar nikal rahe the
 Boys and girls standing outside the vanity van felt steamy scenes running inside
 tabhi achaanak dhamaake ke saath daravaaza khulaa
 Everyone's heads turned towards the voice
 missile kii tarah ek ke baad ek, do juute baahar nikle
 While flying
 baahar khadey kru members us drametic seen ko miss nahin karnaa chaahate the jo shoot kaa hissaa nahin tha
 For him this total was worth the money
 sweety venity vine se baahar nikali
 She had magenta lipstick on her lips
 vah bahut gusse main thi
 It seemed that she is playing a role in an action film
 uski chaal dabang ke chulbul pandey kii yaad dilaa rahi thi
 She was shivering in anger
 do alag alag sansar hill gaye the
 But 112 days ago things were not like that
 aakhir kya hua tha, in 112 dinon main?(penguin books india kii ijaajat se prakashit) Union Minister and RLSP President Upendra Kushwaha once targeted Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 upendra kushvaha ne kaha ki 2020 tak nitish kumaar 15 varshon kaa apana kaarykaal puraa kar chuke honge
 In such a situation, he should now relinquish the post of Chief Minister, because the tenure of 15 years is very long
 upendra kushvaha ne kaha ki main samajhataa hum ki nitish kumaar khud 2020 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle mukhyamantri kaa pad chhod denge
 In the politics of Bihar, it can be seen as a game of check and check
 spasht taur par kahen to upendra kushvaha ko nitish kumaar kaa cheharaa manjuur nahin he
 They have already expressed this earlier
 ab use raajnneeti kii chaashni main lapet kar bol rahe hai
 Upendra Kushwaha said that the people of Bihar gave Nitish Kumar a chance to remain Chief Minister for 15 years
 itnaa samay kisi bhi netaa ke liye kaaphi hota he
 After ruling for 15 years, Nitish should declare himself to leave the Chief Minister's chair
 kyonki 15 saal kaa samay kaaphi lanbaa hota he
 He said that Nitish Kumar has also been our leader and i know him well
 kushvaha ne ye bhi kaha nitish kumaar ke mukhyamantri banane se pehle jab ham campan karte the to jansabhaon main kehete the ki lalu rabari ko aapane 15 saal shashan karne ke liye diya, hamen kam se kam paanch saal to dijie
 But now this period has moved towards 15 years
 isse pehle bhi upendra kushvaha ne nitish kumaar par hamalaa kiya tha
 In an event organized in his parliamentary constituency, Upendra Kushwaha had said that his party Nitish's party is bigger than JDU
 loksabhaa main hamaare teen saansad hai to jediu ke sirf do
 In such a situation, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party should get more seats than Janata Dal United in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections
 siyaasi halkon main charchaa he ki kushvaha bijepi ke shah par hi nitish par hamalaa kar rahe hai
 Because BJP is upset with Nitish's attitude
 lihaaja wo upendra kushvaha ke jariye nitish kumaar ko haisiyat bataa rahi he
 And anyway, Upendra Kushwaha himself has also been desperate to become the chief minister

 If your partner is honestly sharing his shortcomings with you, do not react badly to them
 na hi un baton ko dil par lagaaein
