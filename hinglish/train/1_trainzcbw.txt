 In the Saradha chit fund scam, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) sent notice to 6 people, including Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Shatabdi Roy
 idi ne shatabdi roy ke alaava purv tiemasi saansad kunal ghosh, nitu sarkaar, sajjan agarwar, sandhir agarwal or bamba ko notice bheja he
 All have been asked to appear for questioning this month
 isse pehle 9 july ko bangla abhinayta prosenjit chatarji ko idi ne roj vaili chit fund ghotaale ke silsile main 19 july ko pesh hone ke liye bulaayaa
 a senior ED official said that Chatterjee will be questioned under the Money Laundering Act
 idi ne kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) kii ore se darj ek praathmiki ke aadhaar par maamla darj kiya
 According to ED officials, the Rose Valley Ponzi scheme scam operated by the group's chairman Gautam Kundu was revealed in 2013
 samooh ne kathith rup se alag alag yojanaon ko chalaane ke liye 27 companiyaan banaain
 It allegedly raised Rs 17,520 crore from depositors in West Bengal, Assam and Bihar
 pichley maheene sibiai ne land agro chit fund maamle main pashchim bengal ke 22 alag-alag sthanon par chhapemari kii thi
 According to the CBI, raids were conducted in 22 different places in seven districts, including Kolkata
 is maamle se sambandhit dastavejon ko jabt kar liya gaya
 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh have been announced
 mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaari ke naam par basapa se mayawati hai to sapa se akhilesh lekin ab tak hue survey main sabase badi party banakar saamne aane vaali bijepi kaa cheharaa abhi tak final nahin ho paaya he
 The Congress also fielded former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit in view of the upper caste and especially the Brahmin vote bank, but she was seen surrendering amidst the talk of the alliance
 shila ne ek tivi intervyuu main yah baat khud kahi thi ki agar congress-sapa gathbandhan hota he to main upi kii bhalaai ke liye peeche hat jaaoongi
 The BJP is surviving in the Lok Sabha elections after a spectacular performance in two consecutive states (delhi and Bihar), after defeating the assembly elections, BJP is now moving ahead in UP
 mana ja rahaa he uttar pradesh kavidhansabha chunaav2019 ke aamchunaavon par bhi asar daalega yahi vajah he ki bijepi ne ab tak koi cheharaa nahin tay kiya he
 There is no wrong message in the public, so the BJP leaders are seen saying that our worker and development is the face of our Chief Minister
 party sutron ke mutabik bijepi ek baar phir pradesh main majboot janaadhar or spashtvaadi chhavi vaale netaa rajnath singh par daanv khelnaa chaahati he lekin kuch kaarnon ke chalate naam kii ghoshnaa nahin kii ja rahi he
 The local leader said on the condition of anonymity that the bjp's Chief Minister will be decided only after the election
 chal rahi he taiyaarisutron kii maane to akhilesh auki mayawati kii chhavi se takkar lene kii khatir bijepi rajnath par hi daanv khelnaa chaahati he
 Apart from this, the big reason is that Rajnath Singh had run a Kisan Credit Card during his Chief Minister's term, the BJP is trying to cash in on Rajnath's face in an attempt to bring the troubled rural section towards him
 prachaar abhiyaan main yah baat saamne laane kii taiyaari he lekin aupchaarik ghoshnaa se bachane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Whatever poster-banner BJP will make in the state, along with Modi and Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh will also be kept in the picture
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki sabhi tasviren ek hi sies kii rakhi jaaengi
 It is a problem in taking decisions, BJP preparing to contest elections on issues of development, corruption, deteriorating law and order in the state, believes that Rajnath's face can benefit the party in the state
 haalanki party ke ek hisse kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki rajnath ko saamne karne par brahman matadaata naaraaz ho sakate hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why the BJP does not want to project him as the Chief Minister but is being brought to the fore by making him the major face of the party's campaign
 ajtak ke survey main bhi rajnath the sabaselokapriy bijepi netaapako bataa den ki india today or exis ne milakar upi main ab tak kaa sabase bada chunavi survey kiya tha
 The survey tried to know the political mood of UP
 survey main bataur mukhyamantri logon kii pehali pasand akhilesh yadav banakar ubhar the
 This is a big election for Akhilesh, who is struggling with the infighting of the party
 bijepi ne maidan main koi siem ummidavaar nahin utaara he
 In such a situation, Akhilesh has full opportunity to take advantage of it
 siem kii pasand main duusare number par mayawati thim to rajnath singh ne teesraa sthaan hasil kiya tha
 This was Hall Akhilesh Yadav - 33% Mayawati - 25% Rajnath Singh - 20% Yogi Adityanath - 18% Priyanka Gandhi - 1% Mulayam Singh - 1% Varun Gandhi - 1% reliance communications (arcom) ne sweden kii doorsanchaar upkaran banane vaali company arikson ko 550 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kar diya he
 But he has paid this money from his elder brother Mukesh Ambani
 agar company aisa karne main vifal rahati he to arcom ke chairman anil ambani ko 3 maheene jail kii sajaa kaatani pad sakati thi
 In such a situation, elder brother Mukesh Ambani came for help
 musiibat main madad ke liye anil ambani ne bade bhai mukesh ambani kaa shukriya kiya
 He said that thanks to brother Mukesh Ambani and sister-in-law Nita for help at the right time to repay the debt after the Supreme Court order
 darasal reliance communications ko supreme court ke dwaara tay kii gai mangalvaar tak kii samaysima ke bheetar yah bhugtan karnaa tha
 During the hearing of the case last month, the Supreme Court had termed it a case of willful non-payment and found Anil Ambani guilty of contempt of court
 jiske baad court ne company ko aadesh diya ki vah yaa to chaar hafte ke bheetar arikson ke bakaaye kaa bhugtan kare yaa ambani teen maah jail kaa karawas bhugten
 a source associated with the development said that rcom had paid Rs 550 crore to Ericsson as per the Supreme Court's instructions
 haalanki reliance communications (arcom) kii ore se isaki aadhikaria bayaan abhi tak nahin diya gaya he
 At the same time, no response could be obtained from Ericsson in this regard
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne arcom ko bhugtan karne ke liye 19 march tak kaa samay diya tha
 If the company fails to do so, Anil Ambani could face up to three months in jail
 arcom isse pehle arikson ko 118 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kar chuki thi
 At the same time, Reliance Capital of Anil Ambani Group has decided to sell stake in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management and Reliance General Insurance to repay the debt
 company ne kaha, 'mukhya kaarobaar se itar kii kuch sampattiyon tathaa reliance nippan main 43 fisadi or reliance general insurance main 49 fisadi hissedari bechakar kul karj main 50-60 fisadi kii kami kii jaaegi
 ' mumbai police ne shahar main drugs kii taskari karne vaale ek shaatir badmaash ko giraftaar karne main kamyaabi hasil kii

 police ke anusaar, chandaaria mumbai ke pashchimi ilaake main sakriy tha or bahut hi suniyojit tareeke se ilaake main hone vaali partiyon or samarohon main drugs kii supplai karata tha
 The ANC chief said, "chandaria has been sent to police custody till 16 December
 "sutron ne bataaya ki chandaaria ke nigerian drug racket se jude hone kii bhi jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Since LSD is smuggled primarily by gangs of European smugglers, international contacts with Chandaria are also being investigated

 ANC sources said that about Rs 50 crore worth of drugs have been collected in Mumbai since November
 sutron kaa kahana he ki yuvaaon ke bich LSD teji se lokapriy hua he or adhiktar partiyon ke dauraan iskaa istemaal kiya jaataa he

 Often seen in films carrying pigeons carrying the message of loving couples
 puraane jamaane main sandesh le jane ke liye kabutar ek ahm madhyam hua karata tha
 But the relevance of pigeon in the digital age is a bit surprising
 ji haa, ham baat kar rahe hai odisha police ke kabutaron kii, jinhen sandesh bhejne ke liye aaj bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Here the police have a group of 50 pigeons, specially trained to carry messages from one place to another
 haal hi main in 50 kabutaron ke liye trial kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 During this time, the police sent messages from the OUAT Ground in Bhubaneswar to Cuttack via pigeons
 is abhyaas kaa mukhya uddeshy aapadaa prabandhan he
 If for any reason the modern communication system goes bad, the police can exchange their messages through this traditional medium
 75 kimi prati ghante kii raftaar se udein kabutaron ko indian neshnal trust for art and culture heritage kii madad se prashikshan diya jaataa he
 Pigeons can fly at a speed of 75 kmph
 road network se kate kshetron main ye tarika kargar he
 The age of a pigeon is about 20 years
 kabutar ko ek baar prashikshit kar diya, wo lambey samay tak kaam de saktaa he
 It is being said at the time of natural disaster that whenever a natural disaster has occurred
 jab bhi communication system dhwast hue, kabutaron ke jariye sandeshon kaa aadan-pradaan kiya gaya
 In 1982, there was a severe flood in Banki district of Odisha
 us vakt saare system dhwast ho gaye the
 Then the police had done the work of sending messages to different places only through pigeons

 Discussions continue at this time regarding the aggressiveness of Team India's captain Virat Kohli in the field
 main poochta hum, dikkat kya he viraat kohli kii aakraamakata main! kyon vahi bhadrajan bane rahe? cricket ko ‘jentalman game' banane rakhane kii zimmevary hindustan ne hi thode hi uthaa rakhi he
 The biggest thing about the honor of 'gentleman' in the past? The world starts taking 'soft' people as 'taken for granted'
 dabaane lagati he
 When Sourav Ganguly taught to speak with eyes in his eyes, Team India also learned to win
 mahendra singh dhoni kii ‘coolnes' main bhi aakraamakata thi
 Now Virat Kohli is hitting the chest
 kohli kaa seenaa us 56 inch kii tarah khokhla nahin hai jahaan se sirf baaten or vaade nikalate hai
 There is fire inside this chest which only wants to be extinguished by victory
 kamyaabi ke liye ye aatmavishvaas bhi jaruri he-'tum ek standing captain ho or main duniya kaa sarvshereshth ballebaaz!' kohli ne ye kaha ho yaa na kaha ho, bande main quvvat he tabhi dambh dikhaa rahaa he
 They say no

 He says that Kohli's good performance ignores many of his unacceptable antics, while statistics suggest that aggression boosts Kohli's performance

 They are talking about enjoying it

 bro kohli, world cap main aapke 'ladakon' ko is 'aadmi' kii zaroorat padegi!australia main charchaa chal rahi he ki test cricket ke romaanch ke liye maidan par 'friendli benter' jaruri hai
 Hotness is right but it should not cross the line of insolence
 ek samay manjrekar ne master blaster sachin tendulkar ke footwork par sawaal uthaate hue tippanee kar di thi ki un par umr haaavee ho gayi he
 Manjrekar, who then questioned 'footwork', had to come on 'backfoot'
 cinemai sansar kii prabuddhata hameshaa se bahes kaa mudda rahaa he
 When a person like Naseeruddin Shah gives the worst deal to Kohli, it is a little surprising
 koft hoti he

 It is true that this country of Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi has been non-violent and peace loving

 'hindustan' needed humility and tolerance in the path of becoming a spiritual master
 kal kaa hindustan aadhyatmik guru bananaa chahta tha magar aaj kaa india aarthik shakti ban kar vishwa guru bananaa chahta he
 Wants to establish dominance quickly and aggressively
 aaj kaa yuva adheer he
 Is anxious baichaiyn he
 He has to succeed at any cost
 aaj kaa yuva yaachak nahin he use haq chhinana or haq jataana aata he
 The world is witnessing the growing power of India through information and technology
 labboluab yah he ki india ko aakraamakata pasand he
 Whether it is the Modi brand aggression of 'surgical strike', or Rahul Gandhi's 'chowkidar Chor Hai' or Arvind Kejriwal's 'angry Young Man' style of 'delhi Ke Malik Hum Hain'
 logon ko pasand aa rahaa he
 Virat Kohli of Delhi has no lack of aggressiveness

 Ashok Kumar, son of hockey player and Dhyanchand Singh, was responding after the Bharat Ratna was given to Sachin Tendulkar
 ashok dhyanchand ne tab kaha tha ki maine to ummid hi chhod di he ki major dhyanchand ko kabhi bharat ratna milegaa bhi
 Google is our modern memory
 isamen aaj jab dhyanchand ko bharat ratna die jane kii maang ke sandarbh main ghota lagaaya to mukhyadhara ke samachar patron kii khabaren pehle bees pej tak nahin mili
 Only a few news was received
 kisi takniki vajah se aisa hota hoga yaa mere search karne ke tareeke main kami rahi hogi
 Most of the news was in August this year in which it was reported that the Ministry of Home Affairs has also proposed the name of Dhyanchand to the Prime Minister
 isaki soochna griharajya mantri kiran rijiju ne loksabhaa main di thi
 Then a wave of hope ran across the country that no one could stop Dhyanchand from getting the Bharat Ratna
 isaki khabar failte hi bijepi netaa se lekar khilaadi jagat ke log pratikriya dene lage the

 log bhul gaye ki upie sarkaar ke samay bhi khel mantralay ne pradhanmantri karyaalay ke samaksh dhyanchand ke liye prastaav bheja tha
 Then why did it need to be sent again and why was it exaggerated
 google smriti kosh se pataa chalata he ki manmohan singh ne bhi dhyanchand ke naam par vichaar kiya tha par sabko pataa tha ki milanaa to tendulkar ko hi tha
 Along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, he has been strongly advocating the award of Bharat Ratna to Dhyanchand

 As news of the award of Bharat Ratna to Sachin Tendulkar began to rise, the demand for Dhyanchand increased

 aisa nahin he ki ve aaj khud ko asahaj paa rahe honge
 If you have a government then how to complain, therefore, Shivraj Singh Chauhan kept on publicly expressing the joy of receiving Bharat Ratna for another Lal Atal Bihari Vajpayee of Madhya Pradesh
 jo ki puri tarah se sahi bhi he
 Opponents are also happy with Vajpayee getting Bharat Ratna
 niyam ke mutabiq ek saal main bharat ratna teen logon ko diya ja saktaa he
 It is difficult to guess why Dhyanchand did not get Bharat Ratna this time too
 aisa nahin he ki pradhanmantri ke dhyaan main dhyanchand nahin hai
 Narendra Modi had also invited Dhyanchand's son Ashok Dhyanchand to his swearing-in ceremony
 par bharat ratna dene kii baari ai tab dhyaan se kyon gaayab ho gaye dhyanchand

 a film i passionately believe in
 
 
 the last film my father worked on before he left us
 
 
 
 it was his dream to see this film come through
 
 
 
 i couldn’t fulfil his dream then
 
 
 
 my spirit was broken
 
 
 
 but today his wish has found a relationship with celluloid
 
 
 
 the story of turbulent relationships and eternal love has found a voice
 
 
 
 the film has been woven,nurtured and visualised by ABHISHEK VARMAN
 
 
 
 and the film Is KALANK! Set in the 40’s but it’s heart lives on
 
 
 
 
 TOMORROW the journey begins
 
 
 
 
 am excited 
 
 
 anxious and emotional about this one
 
 
 i do hope you join us on our path to undying love

 pakistan kii taraf se ahamed shahzad or younis khan kii anbhavi jodi ne abhi 4 oven main 11 ran hi jode the ki mohammad shami ne apni bounsar ke jaal main younis khan ko fansaa liya
 Younis could not move away from the ball even though he wanted, and the ball touched his glove and went to Dhoni
 6 ran banaakar younis laute to kam anbhavi haaris sohail ne krij sanbhali
 Sohail would have also returned in the sixth over if Dhoni had not missed a chance to run him out

 The duo together put the score to 79 in the 18th over, but Haris Sohail missed Ashwin's last ball of the same over and the ball touched Suresh Raina with his bat
 haaris ne 48 gendon main 36 ran banaae
 Now to support Ahmed Shehzad at the crease, the captainsmisbah-ul-hakthae, together, slowly raised the score to 100 in the 23rd over
 lekin pari kaa 24waan over pakistan ke liye tufaan lekar aayaa
 The second ball of this over of Umesh Yadav finished the work of Ahmed Shehzad

 35wein over main 22 ran banane ke baad mohammad shami kii gend ko udaane kii koshish naa sirf afridi ko balki pakistan ko bhi baari pad gai
 In the same over, Shami also dealt with Wahab Riaz
 riyaj ne dhoni ko kaich thamane se pehle 4 ran banaae
 misbah-ul-haq was involved in playing the captain's innings
 37wein over me unhone apni half centuri bhi puri kar lee
 But the search for a trusted partner at the other end could not be completed
 pari ke 43wein over main mohit sharma kii gend par mohammad shami ne yasir shah kaa kaich tapakaa diya
 But on the very next ball Umesh Yadav made no mistake at mid on
 yasir shah ne 13 ran banaae, lekin jane se pehle captain misbah ke saath milakar pakistan kaa score 200 ke paar pahunchaa gaye
 Misbah now began to show sharp hands

 The rest of the work was completed by Mohammad Shami in the 46th over of the innings
 shami kii gend ko mid on ke upar se udaane kii koshish main wo 76 ran banaakar rahane ko kaich thama baithe
 This was Shami's fourth wicket

 endie sarkaar kaa payalat project ganga ke kayakalp kaa shriganesh ho chukaa he
 The secretaries of the four ministries will prepare the project report in a month
 sab kuch yojanabaddh tareeke se hota rahaa to ganga naa keval saaf hogi balki jaldi hi ganga main malwahak naukaaen chalengi or touriston ke liye ganga hot hub ban jaaegi
 That is, the Ganges will then start to make a living with life
 baithak main tay kiya gaya ki mantralayon ke sachiv detail project report taiyaar karenge or us par jald se jald kaam shuru ho jayega
 Ganga Revival Minister Uma Bharti said, 'once again, Gadkari ji has taken care of Ganga
 jaldi hi ganga kaa aviral pravaah hoga
 The Ganges will be clean and with life and also the source of our salvation after life
 van paryaavaran, urja, jal sansaadhan or ganga punaruddhar, jahajrani or paryaton mantralay ke is saajha payalat project ke mutabik ganga ke punaruddhar kii is pariyojna main kai pahaluon kaa saath rakhaa gaya he
 The project will be directly linked to Ethics, Ecology and Economy
 iske liye rudki sahit teen jagah research centre banaaye jaaenge
 - Cargo and passenger boats will be run from Varanasi to Hooghly in the Ganges
 - naavon ke parichaalan ke liye 45 meter chaude or teen se paanch meter gahare corndor banaaye jaaenge
 So that the boats can move comfortably
 - jalmaarg se malbhaade main teen guna kami aegi
 The average cost of freight is one and a half rupees by road, while it will come to fifty paise by boat
 - ganga main har sau kilometre kii duuri par aise pul banaaye jaaenge jinamein chote baandh bhi bane honge
 This will not stop the Ganges water flow
 - aise pul or baandh se machhlee utpaadan ko nayi raftaar milegi
 The Secretary will conduct research on all these schemes and explore new possibilities

 Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari said, 'this is the beginning
 hamane sachivon se suzav or project report maangi he
 It will be implemented soon
 ganga pariyojna par milane vaali safalataa ko baaki nadiyon par bhi amal kiya jayega
 Although Uma Bharti said that after the success of the Ganga project, the number of other rivers will also come, but the same measures that have been made for the Ganga will not be done blindly
 is dauraan uma bharti ne kaha, ‘baaki nadiyon par amal ke liye hamen yamuna yaa dakshin or pashchim kii nadiyon ke site, sijan or renfol jaise muddon par bhi dhyaan dena hoga
 Because these three standards are different for every river
 pehle congress phir upie sarkaron ne pichley tees saalon main arabon rupee ganga safai ke naam par baha diye lekin nateeja rahaa vahi dhak ke teen paat
 The condition of Ganga has not improved

 kendriya mantri anant kumaar hegade (ananth Kumar Hegde) ne sabarimala mandir maamle (sabrimala Temple Issue) ke sanchaalan ko lekar kerala sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa
 He said that due to the way the government is handling this matter, this matter has now become like 'day-to-day rape of Hindus'
 khaas baat yah he ki mantri kaa bayaan sabarimala mandir (sabrimala Temple Issue) main do mahilaon ke pravesh kii soochna par hinduvadi sanghathanon dwaara rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf bulaae gaye pradarshan ke baad aayaa he
 Hegde said that "the bias of the Chief Minister, rather than the bias of the Left, is causing complete confusion in Kerala
 sarvocch nyaayalay (supreme Court) ne jo nirdesh diya he, main usase puri tarah sahamat hum
 Since law and order is a state subject, it should have been looked into
 " janata ke vishwaas ko thes pahunchaae bina kootnithik rup se prabandhit kiya ja saktaa he
 "he said that the Kerala government was a complete failure
 main kahana chaahunga ki yah puri tarah se din dahaade hindu se balaatkaar jaisaa he
 Let us tell you that politics has been hot since the entry of two women in Sabarimala on Wednesday
 ise lekar congress or bhaajapa ne kerala kii makapa netritv vaali ldf sarkaar or mukhyamantri pinaraai vijayan par jamkar hamalaa bolaa he
 Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that the entry of women into the temple hurt the sentiments of the devotees and it reflected the stern attitude of the Chief Minister in getting women of restricted age to enter the temple
 vahiin, congress netaa chennithalaa ne patrakaron se kaha ki ‘vimen wal' abhiyaan ke baad unhen koun mandir lekar gaya? 24 disambar ko pehali baar mandir main pravesh karne ke asafal prayaas ke baad se ve kai dinon se faraar thim
 It is clear that they were under police protection
 police ne mukhyamantri ke nirdeshaanusaar kaam kiya
 This is the result of a stubborn attitude of the Chief Minister
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki shuddhikaran ke liye mandir kaa band kiya janaa sahi he
 In this case, the leader of the United Democratic Front also condemned the government
 unhone kaha ki vah rajyabar main iske khilaaf pradarshan karenge
 Whereas BJP state chief PS Sreedharan Pillai said that the Kerala government would have to face the wrath of Lord Ayyappa
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki rajya sarkaar ne shraddhaluon kii bhaawanaaon ko thaga he
 At the same time, BJP leader MT Ramesh said that the party will support the name chanting by the devotees in the state for the next two days
 rajya sarkaar ke sabarimala main sabhi umr kii mahilaon ko anumati dene ke sheersh adaalat ke aadesh ko lagu karne ke faisle ke khilaaf "naam japam" andolan kii aguwai karne vaali sabarimala karm samiti ne mukhyamantri ke istife kii maang kii he
 It should be noted that on September 28 last year, the Supreme Court allowed women between 10 and 50 years of age to enter the temple
 iske baavjood vibhinn shraddhaluon or dakshinpanthi sanghathanon ke virodh ke kaaran koi bacchee yaa yuva mahilaayein mandir main pravesh nahin kar pain thim
 The two women entering the temple have been identified as Kanakadurga (44) and Bindu (42)
 unhone buudhvaar ko subah teen bajkar 38 minute par parmparik kaali poshaak pahane bhagwaan ayappa ke pavitra mandir main pravesh kiya tha
 They covered their heads
 mangalvaar ko mahilaon ke ‘vimen wal' abhiyaan ke tahat desh ke uttari sire kasargod se dakshini chor tak kareeb 620 kilometre lambii ek shrinkhalaa (chanan) banane ke ek din baad mahilaayein darshan ke liye pahunchi thi

 sarkaar ne raajnneetik dalon ko soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) adhinium se baahar rakhane ke liye isamen sanshodhan ko manjuuri dene ke kendriya mantrimandal ke faisle kaa shuukravaar ko bachaav kiya or kaha ki yadi is maamle main kendriya soochna ayog (siaisi) kaa aadesh lagu hota he to koi bhi raajnneetik dal kaam nahin kar paaegaa
 But activists have strongly criticized the government's move
 unka kahana he ki isse paardarshita evam javabdehi kaa ksharan hoga, jisase antat: loktantr kaa nuksaan hoga
 The CIC on June 3 ordered six national parties to be brought under the purview of the RTI Act
 lekin kendriya mantrimandal ne guuruuvaar ko isamen sanshodhan ko manjuuri de di
 The amended act would leave political parties out of its purview
 artiai adhinium main sanshodhan kaa yah prastaav sansad ke monsoon satr main pesh kiya ja saktaa he, jo paanch agast se shuru ho rahaa he
 Defending the central government's decision, Union Law Minister Kapil Sibal said, "the government respects the CIC, but was concerned about its order
 yah aadesh raajnneetik vyavastha par hamalaa karata he
 People can get all kinds of information from political parties
 duniya main kahin bhi aisa nahin hota
 All political parties are against the order of the CIC
 yadi ise lagu kiya jaataa he to raajnneetik dal kaam nahin kar paaenge
 "he said that the government was left with two avenues, one to file a petition in the High Court against the order of CIC
 lekin isamen bahut samay lagata
 Therefore, another way of amending the RTI Act was chosen, which may happen soon
 jaldbaaji isliye he, kyonki siaisi kaa aadesh prakriya se sambandhit he
 We want an early resolution on this issue
 unhone yah bhi kaha, "is tarah kii aam dharna he ki raajnneetik partiyaan javabdeh nahin hoti hai
 The people elect us
 hamen jo bhi anudaan miltaa he, uskaa khulaasa hamen nirvachan ayog ke samaksh karnaa hota he
 It would not have been possible if the grant received to political parties was unclear
 " Sibal said that any grant of more than Rs 20,000 to political parties has to be announced before the Income Tax Department
 yah saarvajanik bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 This would not have been possible if political parties acted with secrecy
 unhone kaha, "ham nirvachan ayog ko sampatti evam rinon tathaa apane kharch kaa byora dete hai
 There is complete transparency in this
 raajnneetik dal na to companiyaan hai or na hi nyaas
 These are voluntary associations of people
 " Sibal said, "political parties are not appointed
 ham chunavi prakriya ke tahat logon ke paas jate hai
 We are elected separately from government employees
 yah mul antar he
 "comments kaaryakartaaon ne haalanki sarkaar ke is kadam kii aalochana kii he
 Venkatesh Nayak of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) said, "the government abused its authority to revoke the CIC order
" ve paardarshita evam javabdehi sunishchit karne main ek baar phir vifal rahe, jiskaa vaada ve apni har ghoshnaa-patr main karte hai
 " artiai kaaryakarta shailesh gandhi ne kaha, "yah ek ghatiya nirnay he
 This is definitely the degradation of democracy
 unhen kam se kam logon ke saath samvaad karnaa chahie, kyonki yah unke moulik adhikaron se judaa maamla he
 " siaisi ne teen june ko chah rashtriya dalon ko artiai adhinium ke daayre main laane kaa aadesh diya tha
 But the Union Cabinet on Thursday approved the amendment
 sanshodhit adhinium main raajnneetik dal iske daayre se baahar ho jaaenge
 This proposal to amend the RTI Act can be introduced in the monsoon session of Parliament, which starts on August 5
 centre sarkaar ke is faisle kaa bachaav karte hue kendriya kanoon mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha, "sarkaar siaisi kaa sammaan karti he, lekin iske aadesh ko lekar chintit thi
 This order attacks the political system
 log raajnneetik dalon se sabhi tarah kii jaankaree le sakate hai
 Nowhere in the world does this happen
 sabhi raajnneetik dal siaisi ke aadesh ke khilaaf hai
 If implemented, political parties will not be able to function
 " unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke paas do raste rah gaye the, ek to vah siaisi ke aadesh ke khilaaf ucch nyaayalay main yachika daayar kare
 But it takes a lot of time
 isliye artiai adhinium main sanshodhan kaa doosraa rasta chunaa gaya, jo jaldi ho saktaa he
 The hurry is because the order of CIC is related to the process
 ham is mudde par jald prastaav chaahate hai
 He also said, "there is such a general perception that political parties are not accountable
 hamen janata nirvaachit karti he
 Whatever grant we get, we have to disclose it before the Election Commission
 yadi raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaala anudaan aspasht hota to yah sambhav nahin ho paata
 " sibbal ne kaha ki raajnneetik dalon ko 20,000 rupee se adhik kaa jo bhi anudaan miltaa he, uske bare main iskar vibhaag ke samaksh ghoshnaa kerani padati he
 It can also be made public
 yadi raajnneetik dal gopneeyata ke saath kaam karte to yah sambhav nahin ho paata
 He said, "we give details of assets and debts and our expenses to the Election Commission
 isamen puri tarah paardarshita rahati he
 Political parties are neither companies nor trusts
 ye logon ke svaichhik sangh hote hai
 " sibbal ne kaha, "raajnneetik dalon kii niyukti nahin hoti
 We go to the people as part of the electoral process
 sarkari karmchaariyon se alag hamaara nirvachan hota he
 This is the basic difference
 "tippaniyan Activists have however criticized the government's move
 kaamanwealth human ritis inishiative (siechaarai) ke venkatesh nayak ne kaha, "sarkaar ne apane adhikaron kaa durupyog karte hue siaisi ke aadesh ko nirast kar diya
 He once again failed to ensure transparency and accountability, which he promises in every manifesto
 " RTI activist Shailesh Gandhi said, “this is a cheap decision
 yah nishchit taur par loktantr kaa ksharan he
 They should at least communicate with the people, as it is a matter of their fundamental rights
 " Defending the central government's decision, Union Law Minister Kapil Sibal said, "the government respects the CIC, but was concerned about its order
 yah aadesh raajnneetik vyavastha par hamalaa karata he
 People can get all kinds of information from political parties
 duniya main kahin bhi aisa nahin hota

 The administration took care that the coolers hired on rent may not fall in the name of the tent house
 iske liye jahaan tents house kaa naam laga tha, us par junior doctors association ke stikar chipka die gaye
 Special care was also taken not to see any dirt in the hospital

 pichley kuch maheenon ke dauraan bharat-bangladesh seemaa par bangla or urdu bhashaa main kuta signal milane ke baad yah andeh jataayaa ja rahaa he ki kya charampanthi apane samvaad ke liye is gaiyr paramparaagat tareeke kaa upyog kar rahe hai
 The administration has deployed ham radio operators on duty round the clock in view of these coded language signals
 aise signlon ke bare main sabase pehle june main pataa chalaa tha
 These radio signals and unauthorized radio communications were then captured by amateur ham radio operators in Basirhat and the Sundarbans region
 bangla or urdu bhashaa ke in kuta signlon ke pakad main aane par operataron ne centre ko suchit kiya
 They were then called to an international monitoring center and asked to monitor the signals
 tippaniyan Now a team of 23 ham radio operators are on duty round the clock and trying to find out the actual location of these radio signals
 bengal ameor radio club ke sachiv ambarish naag vishwaas ne bataaya ‘yah ek sandigdh ghatana he or suraksha ke liye bhi khatra he

 ) madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne abhinayta raja muraad ke bayaan se party ke andar bigade maahaul ko sanbhaalane kii koshish kii he
 Shivraj, while tweeting the praises of Narendra Modi on Twitter, compared him to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 aamtaur par gujarat ke mukhyamantri kii tulana bijepi main shivaraj singh chouhan se kii jaati he
 Many big leaders in the party, from Advani, have praised Shivraj Singh Chauhan more than Modi
 lekin ye baat shivaraj bhi jaanate hai ki is vakt hawa modi ke paksh main bah rahi he or ye bhi sach he ki jo hawa ke rukh ke saath nahin bahata, wo der tak ud nahin paata
 That is why this tweet by Shivraj Singh is also being interpreted
 darasal, do din pehle hi raja muraad ne ek kaarykram main topi naa pahanane vaali baat par modi kii khinchaai kii thi or shivaraj singh kii tarif kii thi
 The special thing is that all these things happened in front of Shivraj Singh Chauhan's eyes, but still the Chief of Madhya Pradesh kept quiet
 maukey par shivaraj to chup rah gaye lekin unki chuppi par sawaal uthne lage the ki kya shivaraj singh kaa man modi ke saath nahin mil rahaa he? sutron ke mutabik chunaav prachaar abhiyaan se thik pehle uth rahe in sawaalon par viraam lagaana bhi jaruri tha
 Therefore, pressure was increased on Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 mana ja rahaa he ki dabaav main aakar hi shivaraj singh chouhan ne modi kii tarif kii taaki baat baraabar ho jaae

 In fact, Shiva raised the issue of bypassing leaders while addressing an event organized to start railway projects, in response to which Minister Chinnaya made the remarks during his address

 On the other hand, the mps were furious at Chinnaya's remarks, when he got up to speak, he referred to Shiva's speech and mentioned a Tamil saying that you will reap what you sow
 uske baad unhone mukhyamantri jayalalita ko dhanyavad diya or apana sthaan grahan kar liya

 khud kapil mishra ne isaki jaankaree twitor ke zarie share kii
 First Kapil Mishra was supposed to go to the Lokayukta office on Wednesday, but then he has got the time of 6 July
 ab kapil guuruuvaar ko subah 10 baje lokayukta daftar jaaenge
 Let me tell you that soon after being suspended from the post of minister, Kapil Mishra had made serious allegations of corruption on Delhi government minister Satyendar Jain and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and complained to him in Lokayukta office and also recorded statement in Lokayukta in the last week of May
 Huh
 kapil mishra ke mutabik unhone 16 hazaar pannon kaa saboot taiyaar kiya he, jisamen satyendra jain or arvind kejariwal ke bhrashtachar se jude kai kaagazat hai, jise wo guuruuvaar subah lokayukta ko saunpenge
 According to Kapil Mishra, the evidence he is going to give to the Lokayukta on Thursday includes delays in the investigation of the Jalboard tanker scam, foreign visits of Aam Aadmi Party leaders and the donations given to the party through the reference of fake companies
 aapako bataa den ki kapil mishra ne aam aadmi party ke netaaon kii videshyatra parhue kharche or party ko mili chande kii jaankaree maangi thi or aarope lagaaya tha ki satyendra jain or arvind kejariwal dono mili hue hai, kyonki satyendra jain bhrashtachar karte rahe or arvind kejariwal ne sabakuch pataa hote hue bhi jain ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii
 The BJP has on Sunday criticized Nitish Kumar's call to support RJD supremo Lalu Prasad in Patna to support the JDU candidates in the Rajya Sabha by-election
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa or purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne nitish par aarope lagaaya ki unhone satta or suvidha kii raajnneeti ke liye naitikta, siddhant evam swabhimaan jaise shabdon ko baar-baar ghiskar khota sikaa bana diya he
 Sushil said that till a month ago, Nitish was appealing to the public to throw lanterns, symbolizing the politics of giving oil to Lalu in the sticks and responsible for 15 years of Jungle Raj in Bihar
 lekin ab ve jadyu sarkaar bachaane se lekar party ke rajyasabha ummidavaaron kii jeet ke liye lalu se samarthan maang rahe hai
 He asked Nitish where is the morality left from this? Is Nitish's self-respect and principle left even after calling Lalu and seeking support? susheel ne aarope lagaaya ki mukhyamantri rahete hue nitish ne dal-badal kanoon ke niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hue rajd ke 13 vidhayakon ko vidhansabha main alag gut ke rup main manyata dilaane kii sajeesh rachi
 Was it compatible with the ethics of parliamentary conduct? unhone aarope lagaaya ki phir jab rajd ke samarthan se sarkaar bachaane kii naubat ai to alag gut kii manyata vaale faisle ko sadan ke adhyaksh se waapas karaayaa gaya
 Morality was broken both times, but morality continued to prevail in Juban
 susheel ne aarope lagaaya ki nitish gaiyr-congresavad kii raajnneeti karte rahe, lekin sarkaar bachaane ke liye is siddhant ko 'deep freezer' main daalkar unhone congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke raajnneetik salaahkaar ahamed patel ko phone kar congress ke chaar vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil kar liya
 The Congress neither gave Bihar special state status nor any special package, but Nitish forgot all the principles and took the support of the same Congress
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar bataayen ki bhaajapa ke do or rajd ke teen vidhayakon se istipha dilaakar janata par upachunaav kaa boj daalana kis siddhant kii raajnneeti he? Sushil alleged that Lalan Singh, who called the Kisan Mahapanchayat, showed his strength to Nitish Kumar and worked against the NDA candidates in the last assembly elections
 unako loksabhaa chunaav haarane par pehle emelsi or phir cabinet mantri banavaa diya gaya
 Is this the politics of principle? unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar 17 saal tak bhaajapa ke saath rahe, tab sampradayikta koi mudda nahin tha
 Describing his arrogance as a principle, he broke the alliance and derailed the development of Bihar
 susheel ne kaha ki janata pradesh main agle varsh hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main bhi lalu prasad or nitish kumaar donon ko karaari shikasat degi, jo naitikta, sampradayikta or siddhant kii maala japate hue bhrashtachar par pardaa daalkar vikaas virdohi raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 The Prime Minister must have dreamed about 3
5 million people, whose one fad decision led to the loss of jobs
 notebandi se dar-badar hue in logon tak sapanom kii supplai kam na ho isliye vigyapanon main hazaron karod phunke ja rahe hai
 The Modi government has spent about Rs 5000 crore on electronic and print advertisements in four and a half years
 manmohan singh kii pichhali sarkaar saal main 500 karod karch karti thi, maujuuda sarkaar saal main kareeb 1000 karod karch kar rahi he
 This is not a complete account of advertisements
 abhi yah hisaab aana baaki he ki 5000 karod main se kin kin channelon or akhbaaron par vishesh krupa barasaai gai he or kinhen nahin diya gaya he
 3
5 million people in these advertisements will be looking for the hope that they got after the night of demonetization
 bogus dharna parosi gai ki garib or nimna madhyamvarg sarkaar ke is faisle ke saath he
 Because he has nothing
 ek chidh he jo amiron ko lekar he
 Demonetisation was an attack on India's economic sovereignty
 iske neeche dabi kahaniyaan dhire-dhire karavatein badal rahi hai
 Election Commissioner OP Rawat said soon after retiring that there was no reduction in black money in the elections
 bhartiya reserve bank ke purv governor rajan or modi sarkaar ke purv aarthik salaahkaar subramanyam bhi khulkar kah rahe hai ki notebandi ke kaaran bharat kii aarthik raftaar dhimi hui he
 Because of this slowness, how many have not got jobs and how many have left, we do not have comprehensive and comprehensive figures
 jinaki naukariyaan gayi wo chup rah gaye ki bharat ke liye qurbaani kar rahe hai
 There is also evidence that people can commit such stupidity for a fraudulent decision
 bainkon main saikadon kaitiyaron ne apni jeb se notebandi ke dauraan 5000 se 2 lakh tak jurmaane bhare
 Suddenly, in my pocket, i made up for the mistake in counting the imposed notes, thinking that they were doing something for the country
 ol india menuphacturer association (AMIO) ne tryder, micro, small or medium sector main ek survey karaayaa he
 In this survey 34,000 enterprises of this sector have been included
 kisi survey ke liye yah choti-moti sankhya nahin he
 This survey has revealed that 3
5 million jobs have been lost in this sector
 tryder segment main naukariyon main 43 fisadi, micro sector main 32 fisadi, small segment main 35 fisadi or medium sector main 24 fisadi naukariyaan chali gai hai
 By 2015-16, the sectors were growing rapidly but declined after demonetisation, which was further accelerated due to GST
 AMIO ne hisaab diya he ki 2015 pehle treders sector main 100 companiyaan munafa kama rahi thim to ab unki sankhya 30 rah gai he
 The organization has said that the worst effect has been on the self-employed
 juute kii marammat, hazaamat, plumber, electrician kaa kaam karne waalon par padaa he
 Demonetisation has made such a cruel impact on the earners after a hard day's work
 2015-16 tak in sector main kaaphi tezi se vruddhi ho rahi thi
 But only after demonetisation it started declining, which became even faster due to GST
 dilli ke ola main chalate hue teen logon se mila hum jinka jiesti or notebandi se pehle lakhon kaa kaarobaar tha
 300–400 people worked
 ab sab barbaad ho gaya he
 They are repaying the loan by driving a taxi
 isamen notebandi or jicketi donon kaa yogadan he
 Think if the jobs of 35 lakh people have gone to medium and small industries, then to whom people the Prime Minister and Amit Shah were talking about giving 7 crore jobs
 pichley saal ke unke bayanon ko search kiijie
 In May 2017, Amit Shah claimed that 7 due to Mudra Loans
 28 karod logon ne swa-rojgaar hasil kiya he
 In September 2017, quoting a report by SKOCH, PTI had reported that due to Mudra loan 5
 5 karod logon ko swa-rojgaar mila he
 What is the basis of that claim
 naukari chhodie ab mudra lone ko lekar khabaren aa rahi hai ki bainkon ke paas paise nahin hai lone dene ke liye
 Many Mudra loans are also on the verge of being npas
 enditivi dot com par onindyo chakravarti ne likhaa he ki 2013-14 main jidipi kaa 2
 8 percent bank loan was given to medium and small scale industries which decreased to 2 in 2017-18
 8 pratishat par aa gaya
 To give loans to this sector, the Reserve Bank is pretending to take possession
 privet sector naukariyon ke maamle main dhwast ho chukaa he
 The infrastructure sector, on which the government takes the applause by telling the budget of millions of crores that so many people will get work, just talk to the people involved in road construction about how much the machine looks and labor as compared to earlier
 maamuli kaam bhi nahin mil rahe hai
 Ask the unemployed for an engineering degree
 sarkari sector hi bachaa he abhi naukariyon ke liye
 Governments do not have to give, their theory goes that minimum governance and maximum governance
 isi slogan main he ki sarkaar apana aakaar chota rakhegi to naukariyaan kahaan se aegi
 Probably also because jobs are being advertised, not being given
 unhen atakaya ja rahaa he, bhatakaaya ja rahaa he
 Gulshan Kumar's biopic film is already in the news before becoming a Mughal
 film ke lead hero ko lekar pench fansaa he
 Many names have surfaced after Akshay Kumar left the film
 jinamein ranbir kapur or sushant singh rajput hai
 But recently, Akshay has given a big statement on the role of Gulshan Kumar

" '''mughal' main lead actors par kanfusion, kya dikhegi mumbai kii kaali sachai?gauratlab he ki gulshan kumaar kii is byopic ko subhash kapur ne likhaa he
 Aamir Khan and Bhushan Kumar are producing the film together
 khabare hai ki film kii shooting agle saal shuru kar di jaaegi or ise christmas 2019 tak relies kiya ja saktaa he
 Akshay, who was out of Gulshan Kumar's biopic, wants a bigger star than him
 The producerfilm will show all the ups and downs of Gulshan Kumar's life
 aarope he ki di-company ke gurgon ne gulshan kumaar kii hatya kar di thi
 After this murder, the dark relationship between the Bollywood and Mumbai underworld was exposed
 aise main yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki film main bollywood kii kaali sachai par bhi roshni daali jaaegi yaa nahin
