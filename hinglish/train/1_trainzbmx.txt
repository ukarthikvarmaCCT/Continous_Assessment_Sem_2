 Recently, i had the opportunity to do two important things
 ham poojya baba sahib ambedkar kii 125 veen jainti kaa varsh manaa rahe hai
 For many years, there was a dispute of land in Mumbai to build his memorial
 mujhe aaj is baat kaa santosh he ki bharat sarkaar ne wo jameen baba sahib ambedkar ke smarak banane ke liye dene kaa nirnay kar liya
 Similarly, in Delhi, an international center should be established in the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the whole world should know this Manishi, know his thoughts, know his work
 ye bhi varshon se lataka padaa vishay tha, isko bhi puraa kiya, shilanyas kiya, or 20 saal se jo kaam nahin hua tha wo 20 maheenon main puraa karne kaa sankalp kiya
 And at the same time, a thought has come to my mind and we are engaged, even today there are some families in our country who are forced to carry the dirt on the head
 kya hamen shobhaa detaa he ki aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch pariwaron ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade? maine sarkaar main bade aagrah se kaha he ki baba sahib ambedkar ji ke punya samaran karte hue 125 veen jainti ke varsh main, ham is kalank se mukti paaen
 Now in our country, any poor has to carry scum on the head, we will not bear this situation
 samaaj kaa bhi saath chaiye
 The government should also fulfill its obligation
 mujhe janata kaa bhi sahyog chaiye, is kaam ko hamen karnaa he
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to say to be educated throughout his life
 aaj bhi hamaare kai dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit samaaj main, khaas karke betiyon main, shiksha abhi pahaunchi nahin he
 On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, let us also resolve
 hamaare gaanv main, nagar main, mohalle main garib se garib kii beti yaa betaa, anpadh na rahe
 If the government does its duty, if the society gets along with it, then we definitely feel satisfaction
 mujhe ek anand kii baat share karne kaa man karata he or ek pidaa bhi bataane kaa man karata he
 i feel proud that two daughters of India brightened the name of the country
 ek beti saina nehwal badminton main duniya main number ek bani, or duusari beti sania mirza tennis dubles main duniya main number ek bani
 Congratulations to both, and also to all the daughters of the country
 garv hota he apano ke purusharth or parakram ko lekar ke
 But sometimes we also lose temper
 jab cricket kaa world cap chal rahaa tha or semi-final main ham australia se haar gaye, kuch logon ne hamaare khilaadiyon ke liye jis prakaar ke shabdon kaa prayog kiya, jo vyavhaar kiya, mere deshavaasiyo, ye acha nahin he
 What should be the game in which there is no defeat, Jai and defeat are part of life
 agar hamaare desh ke khilaadi kabhi haar gaye hai to sankat kii ghadi main unka hausala buland karnaa chaiye
 An atmosphere should be created to create their new faith
 mujhe vishwaas he aage se ham paraajay se bhi seekhenge or desh ke sammaan ke saath jo baaten judi hui hai, usamen pal bhar main hi santulan kho karke, kriya-pratikriya main nahin ulajh jaayenge
 And I'm worried sometimes
 main jab kabhi dekhtaa hum ki kahin aksmaat ho gaya, to bheed ikatthi hoti he or gaadi ko jala detii he
 And we also see these things on TV
 accident nahin hona chaiye
 The government should also make every effort
 lekin mere deshavaasiyo bataaiye ki is prakaar se gussa prakat karke ham trek ko jala den, gaadi ko jala den

 Does it suit us that even today some families in our country have to carry scum on the head? i have said with great urge in the government that in the year of 125th birth anniversary remembering the virtue of Babasaheb Ambedkar, we can get rid of this stigma
 ab hamaare desh main kisi garib ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade, ye paristhati ham sahan nahin karenge
 Society should also be supported
 sarkaar ne bhi apana daayitv nibhaana chaiye
 i also need the support of the public, we have to do this work
 baba sahib ambedkar jivan bhar shikshit bano ye kehete rahete the
 Even today, education has not yet reached many of our Dalit, oppressed, exploited, deprived society, especially among daughters
 baba sahib ambedkar ke 125 veen jainti ke parv par, ham bhi sankalp karen
 In our village, in the city, in the locality, the daughter or son of the poorest of the poor should not remain illiterate
 sarkaar apana karttavya kare, samaaj kaa usamen saath mili to ham zarur santosh kii anubhuti karte hai
 i feel like sharing a pleasure and an agony
 mujhe is baat kaa garv hota he ki bharat kii do betiyon ne desh ke naam ko raushan kiya
 One daughter Saina Nehwal became number one in the world in badminton, and the other daughter Sania Mirza became number one in the world in tennis doubles
 donon ko badhai, or desh kii sari betiyon ko bhi badhai
 Proud of their efforts and might
 lekin kabhi-kabhi ham bhi aapa kho baithte hai
 When the cricket World Cup was going on and we lost to Australia in the semi-finals, the kind words that some people used for our players, which behaved, my countrymen, is not good
 aisa kaisaa khel ho jisamen kabhi paraajay hi na ho are jai or paraajay to jindagi ke hisse hote hai
 If the players of our country have ever lost, they should be encouraged in times of crisis
 unka nayaa vishwaas paidaa karne kaa maahaul bananaa chaiye
 i am confident that from the future we will learn from the defeat and will not get entangled in the action and reaction in a moment by losing balance in the things which are associated with the honor of the country
 or mujhe kabhi-kabhi chintaa ho rahi he
 Whenever i see that something happens suddenly, a crowd gathers and burns the car
 or ham tivi par in chizon ko dekhte bhi hai
 Should not be an accident sarkaar ne bhi har prakaar kii koshish kerani chaiye
 But tell my countrymen that by expressing anger in this way, we burn the truck, burn the car
 
 
 
 Dead does not come back kya ham apane man ke bhaavon ko santulit rakhke kanoon ko kanoon kaa kaam nahin karne de sakate hai? sochna chaiye
 Well, today my mind is very distressed due to these incidents, especially due to natural calamities, but in the midst of it, with patience, with confidence, you will also take the country forward, any person of this country
 
 
 dalit ho, peedit ho, shoshit ho, vanchit ho, adivasee ho, gaanv kaa ho, garib ho, kisaan ho, chota vyapaaree ho, koi bhi ho, har ek ke kalyaan ke maarg par, ham sankalp ke saath aage badhate rahenge
 Students' examinations have been completed, especially students of 10th and 12th must have made holiday programs, i wish you all the best
 aapkaa vekeshan bahut hi acha rahe, jivan main kuch nayaa seekhney kaa, nayaa jaanane kaa avasar mili, or saal bhar aapane mehnat kii he to kuch pal parivaar ke saath umang or utsaah ke saath beete yahi meri shubhakamana he
 My greetings to all of you

 iske baad usne laash ko seat par lita diya
 This entire incident was given a lot of thought because he knew that the bogey is completely empty

 ) The Congress on Saturday ruled out any possibility of an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party led by Arvind Kejriwal for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki aaj tak aam aadmi party ke saath koi gathbandhan nahin he

 yah tippanee aise samay ai he, jab congress ke ek pravaktaa ne suzav diya tha ki party ko arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party ke saath kaam karne se koi parhez nahin ho saktaa
 When asked about the possibility of an alliance between the Congress and AAP, party spokesperson Shakti Singh Gohil told reporters that our fight is ideological
 hamaari party badi he, jo logon ko jodne main yakeen rakhti he
 If like-minded parties come together then we will have no problem
 congress ne dilli main chunaav ke baad trishanku vidhansabha banane par kejariwal kii sarkaar ko haal hi main baahar se samarthan diya tha
 However, Gohil said that the Congress is against the politics of violence

 In the Maharashtra case, the Supreme Court has ruled that a majority test in the Legislative Assembly is to be held by November 27

 The court said that the process of floor test should also be broadcast live
 isse pehle ravivaar ko hi congress-ncp or shivasena gathbandhan ne rajbhavan jaakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya he
 But in the letter which has been given to the Governor, it has not been said that under whose leadership the government will be formed? Who will be the Chief Minister? It is also interesting that this letter written in Marathi language is not signed by the Congress Legislature Party leader but by the state Congress President? So far, the leader of the Congress Legislature Party has not been elected, then will the Governor accept the signature of the state president
 kyonki abhi tak yahi bataaya ja rahaa tha ki uddhav thakare hi gathbandhan kii ore se siem honge ab bhi shivasena vidhayak dal ke netaa ekanath scindia hai
 Let us tell you that the letters given in the Raj Bhavan have become important regarding the formation of government in Maharashtra
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav me bijepi ko 105, shivasena ko 56, ensipi ko 54 or congress ko 44 siten mili hai
 The BJP and Shiv Sena together crossed the 145 mark
 lekin shivasena ne 50-50 formule kii maang rakh di jiske mutabik dhai-dhai saal sarkaar chalaane kaa model tha
 Shiv Sena says that the agreement with BJP was done on this formula but BJP claims that no such agreement was reached
 isi lekar matbhed itnaa badha ki donon partiyon kii 30 saal puraani dosti tut gai
 After this, after several rounds of meetings, the congress-ncp and Shiv Sena decided to form a government headed by Uddhav Thackeray and on Saturday, the three parties were going to Raj Bhavan to stake claim
 lekin bijepi ne raat main hi ajit pavaar se milakar baaji palat di or subah 8 baje hi siem devendra fadanvis ne shapath le lee unke saath ajit pavaar dipti siem ban gaye

 sabase pehle priyanka chaturvedi ne apni baat rakhi
 The question was whether the election of the first five states of the Lok Sabha elections 2019 would be considered a litmus test? Will Congress pass or BJP in this test? In response to this, Priyanka Chaturvedi said, There are many issues ranging from Rafael which BJP has given to us
 kisaan, mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh, madhya pradesh kaa vyaapman ghotaalaa or yuvaaon ke rojgaar kaa mudda jisamen pakora banane ko kaha gaya, jaise maamle hai jin par main apane bhai paatra ji ko kehane ai hum ki aap taiyaari kar lo apni haar kii yatra kii
 Chaturvedi said, the matter of elections has been created in Madhya Pradesh

 Responding to Priyanka Chaturvedi's talk, Sambit Patra said, "I am surprised that any election takes place, the Congress Party turns on this tradition
" upi chunaav ke vakt bhi yahi kaha gaya ki congress yahaan se kaaphi aage nikal jaaegi or bijepi kaa vidhwans ho jayega lekin upi main congress ko 7 seat milin

 Rahul Gandhi is such a leader all over the world who has set the record of losing in the Guinness Book
 uske baad bhi meri bahan (priyanka chaturvedi) kii himmat kii daad deni hogi
 In response to Patra, Chaturvedi said, "since the BJP was formed, look at the record of how many defeats they have faced and mix with Congress
" agar sach main kisi kaa naam ginis book main aayega to vah narendra modi kaa naam hoga
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be the first such leader in the history of the country who is sure to lose by an overwhelming majority as much as he came

 Mehbooba believes that since the reign of Hari Singh in 1947, there is a mischief in his coalition government to save Kashmir from the dark well
 mahabuuba kahati hai ki pidipi or bijepi ke bich jo virodhabhas hai, usee ke kaaran kashmir ko lekar nai samaj viksit hogi or vahi ghati ko nai disha degi

 According to him, no one wants Kashmir or PDP to hide this truth

 On that day, Sonia Gandhi reached the Lok Sabha wearing a Gandhi Saree
 achaanak wo gusse main laal ho uthin
 Everyone was in a can
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kaa ye rup pehali baar dekha gaya tha
 The first talk in Parliament is in August 2012
 sansad kaa monsoon satr chal rahaa tha
 a statement by senior BJP leader LK Advani in the Lok Sabha was extremely exasperating to Sonia
 amuman shant or muskaraate dekhi jane vaali sonia ne aakraamak rukh akhriyaar kar liya
 Turned back and what was it then, Congress mps attacked Sonia's defiance, making a noise together
 aakhirkaar maafee maang kar adwani ne maamla khatm kiya

 Then united the entire opposition in the same manner and marched from Parliament House to Rashtrapati Bhavan
 sonia ko centre kii modi sarkaar ke khilaaf ek maukey kii talash thi
 As soon as Sonia Gandhi got this opportunity in the form of land acquisition bill, Sonia Gandhi became active

 Just as a strong government is necessary for the country, a strong opposition to the public system is also necessary
 sonia usee raste par chal rahi hai

 As soon as the monsoon session of Parliament began on Tuesday, Mayawati suddenly came on the political screen
 bispi supremeo mayawati saharanpur ke mudde par rajyasabha main bolne ko khadi hoti hai, sabhapati unhen bolne se rokte hai
 Such a view is seen daily in Parliament
 lekin yahaan halaat kuch or ban gaye
 Mayawati's words suddenly sound out and she goes out of the house saying what is the meaning of membership of Rajya Sabha when she cannot speak up
 ve elaan karti hai ki aaj hi istipha dengi or phir shaam tak istipha de detii hai
 Was this whole matter scripted? Opposition alleges that the entire matter was just to come up for discussion and was scripted
 mayawati teen pej kaa istipha detii hai or usamen saharanpur se lekar si siyaasi mudde uthaa detii hai
 Whereas the rule is that a member will resign only one line while resigning from Parliament and will not give any reason
 is aadhaar par sabhapati ye istipha sweekaar karenge isaki kam hi sambhaavna he
 The views changed completely on Monday amid efforts to unite the opposition against the Modi government
 congress ne mayawati kaa samarthan kiya or phir sabhi congressi saansadon ne walkout kiya
 The opposition is looking round about this whole issue
 mayawati or vipaksh ko is masterstroke se 5 bade siyaasi phaayde hote hue dikh rahe hai
 1
 rajyasabha kii seat pakki kar liaprail 2018 main mayawati kii rajyasabha sadsyta kaa turm puraa ho rahaa tha
 The BSP has no member in the Lok Sabha and it was not possible for Mayawati to re-enter the Rajya Sabha with a vote of only 19 members in the UP Legislative Assembly
 lekin ab istife ke baad congress samarthan main khadi he or argedy chif lalu yadav ne mayawati ko argedy cote se rajyasabha bhejne kii peshkash kii he
 Thus, amidst opposition solidarity, several options for Mayawati's return to the Rajya Sabha have arisen
 2
 Mayawati resigned raising the issue of atrocities against Dalits in Saharanpur, a strong base for regaining political ground in UP
 is tarah apane kor vot bank daliton ke bich mayawati phir se charchaa main aa gayi
 The last two elections were of very bad results for Mayawati
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bispi kaa khaataa bhi nahin khul sakaa tha
 Whereas in the assembly elections, the BSP came down from 80 to just 19 seats
 chunaav ke baad mayawati or akhilesh saath aane kaa elaan kar chuke hai
 Now Mayawati is again ready to make up her lost political ground in UP and this may prove to be a political masterstroke
 3
 Opposition Golband on Dalit issue, Modi's increased challenge By raising the Saharanpur issue in Rajya Sabha, Mayawati has been successful in bringing the issue of Dalits back on the agenda
 pehle vemula maamle, phir saharanpur ko lekar ghiri bijepi ke liye isse chunauti bad sakati he
 In the run-up to the 2019 general elections, all opposition parties, including the Congress, may raise the challenge for Modi by keeping Mayawati ahead in view of the Dalit votebank
 4
 The concept of the National Grand Alliance for 2019 had come as a blow to the opposition's attempts to form the National Grand Alliance before 2019, with Nitish standing with a separate camp in the La Diyarchaist election at the Center, but Mayawati again revived the prospects of opposition unity
 is
 bijepi ke khilaaf sabhi vipakshi dal ekajute dikh rahe hai or ab mahagathbandhan kii kavayad phir aage bad sakati he
 5
 lalu jaisaa haal na ho iske liye pehle se taiyaarihal main lalu family ke sadasyon ke yahaan sibiai or idi ke chaape maare gaye
 This surrounded the Lalu family
 lalu ne ise bijepi ke khilaaf aawaaj band karne kii karrwai bataaya
 But Mayawati has already shown with an aggressive attitude against the Modi government that if there is any action against her, she will have the chance to call it a politics of revenge
 gauratlab he ki mayawati pehle se hi aay se adhik sampatti kaa maamla, taj coridor samet kai maamalon main jaanch kaa saamana kar rahi hai
 In such a situation, if the investigating agencies take action again, they can also raise voice with the opposition

 3 'trials' successful against Modi, how big a challenge for the grand alliance for BJP in 2019? Three trials have been conducted so far by opposition parties to stop the 'vijay Rath' of Narendra Modi led BJP
 vipaksh ko in teenon trial formule se bijepi ko maat or vipaksh ko jeet kaa mantra mila
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections against the BJP, if the opposition enters the election summer by forming a grand alliance on the same formula, it will be difficult for Modi to retain power

 This division has many dimensions and many directions
 uttar bengal jahaan bhagave main ranga dikhataa he to dakshin bengal ab bhi khud ko haraa hi dekhnaa chahta he
 As far as the red color of the left is concerned, it is still visible in some pockets of the state
 ye wo pokets hai jo ab bhi left ke saath vafadaari dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 If we see the voting pattern, it is clearly visible for Hindu and Muslim voters to go in opposite directions
 iske alaava bhi bengal main kuch vibhaajan dikhaai die
 Bengali and non-bengali local and external TMC supporters and TMC opponents, but the echo that is heard from these different Bengal as most slogans is 'jai Shri Ram' and in response to 'jai Hind' or 'jai Bangla'! Bengal witnessed many incidents of violence
 to kya dharmik dhruvikaran hi rajya main nikat bhavishya main chunavi safalataa kii kunjee banegaa
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP wrote a new chapter of success by winning 18 out of 42 Lok Sabha seats from the state
 muslim votaron main 63% ne tiemasi or hindu votaron main se 51% ne bijepi ko vot diya
 The fact is that in independent India, Bengal has never seen such polarization before
 bijepi rajya ke kareeb 25 loksabhaa kshetron ke hindu bahul ilaakon main main hindu vot bank ko majboot karne ke liye jorshor se ‘jai shri ram’ ke naare kaa sahaara le rahi he
 On such a scenario in Bengal, CPM leader Mohammad Salim says- “earlier we used to say that what Bengal thinks today, the rest of India thinks tomorrow
 lekin ab mamata banerjee ke shasankaal main ye ulataa ho gaya
 What India sees now is Bengal now
 ‘jai shri ram’ ke naare ham assi dashak ke aakhir or nabbe dashak ke shuru main suna karte the lekin tab yahaan asar nahin dekha gaya
 But now it has been disputed on Ramnavami and Hanuman Jayanti as if the World Cup match is happening here rather than in England
 ‘bijepi banaam trinmul’ kaa ye match bengal ke mulyon or samskruti ko nasht kar rahaa he
 These are not BJP vs TMC, but BJP and TMC together are fomenting the peace and harmony of Bengal
 kabhi dharm ke naam par to kabhi bhashaa ke naam par wo hamen baantnaa chaah rahe hai
 Nobody has ancestral authority over the slogan 'jai Shri Ram' nor on 'jai Bangla' and 'jai Hind'
 ”jahaan tak mamata banerjee kaa sawaal he to unhone isi hafte iftaar partiyon main hissaa liya
 There have been allegations from her opponents that Mamata Banerjee does this to woo Muslim voters
 mamata banerjee pehle bhi iftaar partiyon main hissaa leti rahi hai lekin is chunavi sijan main unhone bijepi par hamalaa karne ke liye shaayari kaa sahaara bhi liya
 Mamta said to the people present on the occasion of Eid, “the land of Bengal is for everyone, the soil of Bengal, the water of Bengal, the air of Bengal and the fruits of Bengal
 bengal kii zamin netaji subhash chandra bose, swami vivekanand, rabindra nath tagore, kaazi nazarul islam ne hamen sikhaaya ki ham sab ek hai or hamen darane kii jarurat nahin he
 There should be brotherhood between us
 hindu kaa matlab tyaag, islam kaa matlab eemaandaaree, isai kaa matlab pyaar or sikh kaa matlab qurbaani
 This is our India
 ham isaki raksha karenge
 Whoever tries to interfere in it will be devastated
 isliye kisi cheez se darane kii jarurat nahin
 The way he captured EVM, he would go back at the same speed, Jai Hind, Jai Bangla, Jai Bharat, thank you
 ”loksabhaa chunaav ke saat charan puure hone tak mamata banerjee ne khud ko iftaar partiyon se dur rakhaa
 But immediately after the results were announced, in her first public appearance, Mamata made it clear that she would continue to attend Iftar parties
 ramajaan ke aakhri hafte main mamata ne jahaan kai iftaar main hissaa liya vahiin id par saaf or sakht shabdon main apana sandesh diya
 Promoting the Hindi idiom, Mamta said- "the one who hits us will be crushed
" ”is maukey par mamata banerjee ke saath unke bhattije or diamond harbar se saansad abhishek banerjee, mantri javed khan, vidhayak idris ali bhi maujuud the
 Kolkata Police Commissioner Anuj Sharma was also seen on the occasion along with several senior police officers
 bengal main bijepi ke ubhaar ke liye raajnneetik paryvekshak dharmik dhruvikaran ko jimmedaar tehraate hai
 Historian Maidul Islam says this is a matter of concern because after independence there has been a relatively calm atmosphere in West Bengal
 lekin ab pehali baar do samudaayon main itnaa tanaav dekhne ko mila
 One thing is clear that both parties do not know much about the real issues of the communities
 wo aasaan kism kii raajnneeti kaa sahaara le rahe hai jinamein dharmik pratikwaad kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 But what is needed today is real dialogue between the two communities, social initiatives to know the neighbors and people from both communities come forward and peacefully participate in each other's festivities
 jis tarah kaa dhruvikaran bengal main dikh rahaa he wo vaaki hairaan karne vaala he
 "many decisions on behalf of the Trinamool Congress call the result of their anti-muslim appeasement politics
 jaise ki imaamon ko stypend, muharram ke maddenjar durga visarjan ke samay ko badalanaa aadi
 BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, when asked what you would say on such allegations that you are trying to polarize Hindu sentiment politics, he said, "no we are not the one who should stop the immersion of Durga Maa on Muharram 
 iske baad logon ko court se apil kerani pade or court visarjan kii anumati de
 She (mamta) goes to mosques before the election and recites Namaz
 haalanki main kahuunga ki ye acha he ki ve misaal kaayam kar rahi hai
 But they should also go to temples as well
 wo dharmon ko baant rahi hai, ham nahin
 We always say everyone's support, everybody's development
 ”raajnneetik vishleshak shikha mukherjee kaa is vishay main kahana he, “ise or bade aayam se dekhnaa chahie
 This is a kind of mobilization
 aise shabdic pratikon kaa istemaal kiya jaae jo bahut kaaman hai or jinhen har koi jaanata he
 If you take 'jai Shri Ram', it is basically a signal for non-bengali speakers who have a good number in Bengal
 akele kolkata main hi inaki 60% se zyada aabaadi he
 This is very important for those who are very influenced by the idea of BJP, influenced by the idea of hindu Rashtra
 kuch bengali bhi inamen shaamil hai
 i think these calls are for those who are sympathetic to the BJP
 vahiin mamata kaa jahaan tak sawaal he, unhen saafe nahin he ki koun sa naaraa unke liye kargar rahegaa
 Jai Hind or Jai Bangla
 
 
 
 They are not sure what their political status is and whether they have a political slogan
 ”ye sab kuch vaisaa hi he jaise ki murgi or andey main se koun pehle aayaa par hone vaali bahes
 It is difficult to find whether the BJP adopted the slogan of 'jai Shri Ram' more quickly or Mamata Banerjee opted out of it
 ye sara ghatnakram mamata banerjee ko aise doraahe par le aayaa he jahaan mudane ke sirf do hi vikalp hai- left yaa rhite

 bjp's clash with ally Azu in Jharkhand, bjp-ajsu is not talking about seat sharing, wants more seats from 2014 election; Nominations for first phase assembly elections in Azujharkhand have started from today, but seats between ruling BJP and Azu The matter is not finalized
 2014 main saath milakar chunaav ladane vaali bhartiya janata party or ajasu (AJSU) maujuuda chunaav main alag raah par jaati hui najar aa rahi hai
 The screw is stuck between the two seats
 ajasu ne 2014 kii tarj par 8 siton par chunaav ladane se saaf inkaar kar diya he
 Also, it is not ready to give up its traditional seats
 party zyada siton par chunaav ladane kii maang kar rahi he
 While BJP state president Laxman Gilua has said to give 8 seats to AJSU
 saath hi yah bhi kaha he ki seat shering kaa formula jald tay ho jayega
 Give the reason for the confrontation in Suhardev Bhagat in Lohardaga that BJP had a prepole alliance with Azu in the 2014 assembly elections
 ajasu ne 8 siton par chunaav ladaa tha, jinamein se paanch par jeet hasil kii thi
 BJP has asked for two seats from AJSU
 ye siten lohardaga or chandankiyaari hai, jo ajasu kii paramparaagat siten hai
 The problem is that former Congress president Sukhdev Bhagat has recently joined BJP
 sukhdev bhagat lohardaga seat se hi vidhayak hai
 The by-election has been held on this seat once and thrice the assembly elections
 2005 ke pehle chunaav main kangrase ke tikat par sukhdev bhagat jite the
 After this, in 2009 and 2014, Kamal Kishore Bhagat of AJSU won
 haalanki, 2015 main hue upachunaav main sukhdev bhagat phir se jitkar aae the
 Supporting 'vastu' for electoral victory, this book read, Jharkhand BJP president, is now claiming Sukhdev Bhagat for BJP ticket
 jabaki ajasu netaa camel kishor bhagat is baar apni patni ke liye daavedaari thok rahe hai
 In fact, Kamal Kishore Bhagat was convicted by the court in a case of assault, after which the by-election was held on this seat
 chandankiyaari seat par bhi khinchatanchandankiyaari bhi hot seat maani ja rahi he
 This seat was won by Amar Bauri of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha last time
 baad main bouri paala badal kar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye

 He summarized many big things somewhere

 Rahul had surrounded the BJP government in the Lok Sabha and said that the BJP people teach hate lessons while the Congress works to connect people
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki log bhale hi unase nafrat karen lekin unke man main kisi ke prati koi nafrat nahin he
 He further said that following Gandhi's path, he will teach people the lesson of love
 iske baad vah piem modi kii kursi tak pahunche the or unhen gale laga liya tha
 The parties had interpreted Rahul's move differently
 media main bhi is mudde par khub baaten hui thim
 BJP did not like this action
 bijepi netaaon ne yahaan tak kah diya tha ki kaise kisi ke gale padaa jaataa he yah koi rahul se siikhe, lekin rahul gandhi ne ise apane tareeke se liya tha
 The way he put his talks in Tuesday's press conference is also a kind of Gandhigiri
 unhone kaha ki unhone piem se bahut kuch siikhaa he
 He did not forget to say that evms are the problem
 isaki chip main parivartan kar rigelt badale ja sakate hai unhone kaha ki EVM ko abhi logon kaa dil jeetna hoga
 Rahul said that the government will suffer as a result of the difficulties in which the Modi government has imposed demonetisation and GST

 viketon ke peeche se kya bolte hai dhoniaireland ke khilaaf pichley match main 30 over tak spinneron ne jimmaa sambhala
 Subsequently, Dhoni was asked at a press conference whether he believed that he did his best work as a captain when he used his bowling options
 dhoni is par muskaraaye or unhone jawaab diya, ‘nahin
 i am the best when bowlers bowl well
 ’iske baad unhone bataaya ki jab aap ranneeti ke hisaab se chalate hai to phir captain kaa kaam aasaan kaise ho jaataa he
 He said, 'this makes my job a little easier because you have a strategy but until it is implemented well, you do not appear to be a good captain

 You can keep two slips but it will not look good if the bowler bowls on the pad

 " khabar likhe jane tak yah post 25000 se zyada baar tak share kii ja chuki thi
 To find out the truth of the claim, we searched the media report and government order related to it on the internet, but we could not find any government order or media report that confirmed the claim

 How much pension to former MP? At this time every former MP gets a pension of Rs
 25000 / - per month
 agar koi netaa paanch saal se zyada saansad rah chukaa he to uski pension, har saal ke hisaab se do hajaar rupye prati maah bad jaati he

 input:ians The freedom struggle of 1857, which is generally considered to be India's first freedom struggle, is being prepared to be converted into textbooks
 ab 1857 kii kranti se pehle hua 1817 kaa pika vidroh pehla sangram mana jayega
 Union Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar has said that the Paika Rebellion of 1817 will get a place in the history text books from the next session as the 'first Freedom Struggle'
 aaie jaanate hai kya he pika bidroh
 Paika Bidroh, which took place in Odisha in 1817, had shaken the British Raj's roots in eastern India for some time
 mul rup se pika odisha ke un gajpati shaashakon ke kisaanon kaa asangathit sainya dal tha, jo yuddh ke samay raja ko sainya sevaayen muhaiyaa karaate the or shaantikaal main kheti karte the
 These people raised the flag of rebellion against the British Raj in 1817 under the leadership of Bakshi Jagabandhu Bidyadhar
 khurda ke shaasha paramparaagat rup se jagannatha mandir ke sangrakshak the or dharti par unke pratinidhi ke taur par shashan karte the
 He was a symbol of political and cultural freedom of the people of Odisha
 british raaj ne odisha ke uttar main sthit bengal praant or dakshin main sthit madras praant par adhikaar karne ke baad angrejon ne 1803 main odisha ko bhi apane adhikaar main kar liya tha
 The Gajapati king Mukundadeva II of Odisha at that time was a minor and the initial resistance by his mentor Jai Rajguru was brutally repressed and dismembered while Jayaguru's body was still alive
 kuch saalon ke baad gajpati raajaaon ke asangathit sainya dal ke vanshanugat mukhiya bakshi jagabandhu ke netritv main pika vidrohiyon ne adivaasiyon or samaaj ke anya virgon kaa sahyog lekar baghawat kar di
 The Paika Rebellion began in 1817 and spread very rapidly
 haalanki british raaj ke viruddh vidroh main pika logon ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi, lekin kisi bhi myne main yah vidroh ek varg vishesh ke logon ke chote samooh kaa vidroh bhar nahin tha
 The tribals and other sections of Ghumsur, which is currently part of Ganjam and Kandhamal district, played an active role in this rebellion
 vastav main pika vidroh ke vistaar kaa sahi avasar tab aayaa, jab ghumsur ke 400 adivaasiyon ne british raaj ke khilaaf baghawat karte hue khurda main pravesh kiya
 While marching towards Khurda, from where the British fled, the Paika rebels attacked police stations, administrative offices and treasuries, attacking the symbols of the British Raj
 pika vidrohiyon ko kanika, kujang, nayagarh or ghumsur ke raajaaon, jameendaaron, gram pradhanon or aam kisaanon kaa samarthan praapt tha
 The rebellion spread very rapidly to other areas of the province such as Purl, Peepli and Cuttack
 vidroh se pehle to angrej chakit rah gaye, lekin baad main unhone aadhipaty banaae rakhane kii koshish kii lekin unhen pika vidrohiyon ke kade pratirodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The rebels were victorious in many subsequent battles, but within three months the British finally succeeded in defeating them
 iske baad daman kaa vyapak daur chalaa jisamen kai logon ko jail main daalaa gaya or apni jaan bhi ganvaani padi
 a large number of people faced atrocities
 kai vidrohiyon ne 1819 tak gorilla yuddh ladaa, lekin ant main unhen pakad kar maar diya gaya
 Bakshi Jagabandhu was finally arrested in 1825 and died in 1829 while in captivity
 haalanki pika vidroh ko odisha main bahut ucch darja praapt he or bachche angrejon ke viruddh ladaai main veerta kii kahaniyaan padhate hue bade hote hai, lekin durbhaagya se is vidroh ko rashtriya str par vaisaa mahatv nahin mila jaisaa ki milanaa chahie tha
 There can be many reasons behind giving such less importance to such an important event, but it is a matter of satisfaction that the Government of India has decided to appropriately celebrate the 200th anniversary of this event to give proper recognition to this rebellion

 When Patna's two sisters Saba and Farah were born, their heads were interlinked and their heads were joined together
 pasand naa pasand thodi alag thi lekin masti bhare man kii khwahishen ek hoti gayi

 The two sisters, who have struggled with all the difficulties of staying connected, are well appreciated
 ye donon ek duusare kii har baat bina kahe samaj leti hai
 At a young age and like children, he too had dreams of studies and career
 sabaa doctor bananaa chaahati thi or farah ek teacher
 But now all their desires have been reduced
 kyonki ab ye pehle kii tarah kaam nahin kar paatin or naa hi inke paas itane paise hai ki inaki padhai or manhagi davaaiyon kaa kharchaa uthaa saken
 But in spite of this both of them are happy flowing because they are together

 The Congress has once again attacked the Modi government over alleged irregularities in the Rafale plane deal
 shuukravaar ko congress ne daawa kiya ki is ladaaku vimaan saude ke sandarbh main ek nami bhartiya samooh kii raksha company ko kul ek lakh 30 hajaar karod rupee kaa contract mila he
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala targeted Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and accused her of lying to the country
 surajevaala ne kuch dastavej saamne rakhte hue kaha,'rafel saudeki aae din khulti paraten pradhanmantri or rakshaamantri dwaara bole gaye jhooth kii hakeekat khol rahi hai
 At the same time, the BJP spokesperson reacted in the case and said that the Congress was doing negative politics

 # rafalescam60,145 Crore Rs
 kii rafel deal ne sabit kar diya ki ‘culture of kroni capitalism’ yani 3c's modi sarkaar kaa diene ban gaya he

 com / g33s2syt65— Randeep Singh Surjewala (@rssurjewala)july 27, 2018unhone kaha ki 60,145 karod rupee kii rafel deal ne sabit kar diya ki culture of kroni capitalism (culture of Crony Capitalism) modi sarkaar kaa diene ban gai he
 Serving lies and tricking the nation by weaving a cycle of fraud and fraud is now the basic mantra of the BJP in the biggest defense deal
 is saude se sarkari khajaane ko nuksaan pahunchaae jane kii bu aati he
 He claimed that after the agreement for the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft with France, the contract for this aircraft deal was awarded to the defense company of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a private Indian conglomerate, while this company was by agreement
 Was registered 12 days ago and has no experience in making aircraft
 surajevaala ke mutabik is nijee bhartiya company ne pichley saal 16 farvari ko bayaan jari kar kaha ki use rafel se judaa 30 hajaar karod rupee kaa 'ofaset contract' or ek lakh karod rupee kaa 'life saaikal contract' mila he
 He also claimed that in a government release, the defense minister said that he was not aware of the offset contract being given to the private company
 unhone kaha ki 'rashtriya hiton ke saath hue khilwaad' par pradhanmantri narendra modi ko jawaab dena chahie
 Earlier, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has taunted PM Modi for giving Rafale aircraft contract to this company
 surajevaala ne sawaal kiya ki rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman desh se kyon jhooth bol rahi hai? kya pradhanmantri sweekaar karenge ki echeel se contract chhinakar ek nijee samooh ko diya gaya? kya rakshaamantri kii anumati ke bagaiyr ofaset contract kiya gaya?congress kar rahi nakaaratmak raajnneetih bijepivahin, bijepi pravaktaa sudhanshu trivedi ne congress par nakaaratmak raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He said that Congress has always done negative politics and pushed the country back
 congress ne hameshaa rafel saude ko lekar hawaii aarope lagaae hai, jabaki rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman or france sarkaar ne ise galat sabit kiya he
 Despite this, such baseless allegations are being repeatedly made by the Congress, because the Congress has a negative attitude
 trivedi ne kaha ki congress ne desh ke andar dephence production nahin hone diya, kyonki congress chaahati thi ki baahar se kharid hoti rahe or unki deal chalati rahe
 Our government did defense production
 hamane kabhi bhi congress par boforce main aarope nahin lagaae or na hi agasta deal main aarope lagaaya
 The leaders in his party had questioned these deals

 Tunda has confessed in the interrogation of security agencies that he got Hafiz Saeed to meet Dawood
 hafiz said kii sajeesh thi bharat par hamale kii jiske liye daaud ibrahim ne use fund diya
 Tunda has told that Dawood is closely monitored by Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI, while the Pakistan Army likes him very much
 mumbai hamale ke bare main puche jane par tunda ne bataaya ki is hamale kii jaankaree daaud ko bhi thi or khud use bhi thi
 The NIA and intelligence agencies interrogated Tunda overnight and wanted to know each secret, those secrets, which ranged from Lashkar and Hafiz Saeed to Dawood
 jo shaks aatanki hafiz said kaa saathi ho, jo anderworld don daud kaa dahinaa haath ho or unke ishaare par aatank failaata rahaa ho
 There are not one or two but hundreds of secrets buried in his chest
 dilli police ke hathe chadhe tunda se bhi wo saare raaj ugalvaae jane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Abdul Karim Tunda, who came under the grip of law, was interrogated by NIA officials till late in the night
 tunda se khufia agenciyon ke bade afasaron ne bhi poochtacha kii or usase dheron sawaal puche
 Tunda is the person who distributed sweet pills of homeopathic till 33 years ago, who was entrusted by Hafiz Saeed to increase the network of let in India
 tunda hi wo shaks bhi he, jisane daaud ke ishaare par bharat main kai baar aatanki sajishon ko anjaam diya
 Delhi Police also knows that once Tunda opens its mouth, it will tighten the screws on the planters of the terror plant that is growing in India
 isiilie tunda se zyada se zyada or baar-baar sawaal kiye ja rahe hai, taaki jawaab dene kaa dabaav badhaayaa ja sake
 Tunda, who came under the grip of Delhi Police, is being questioned
 ye sawaal lashkar, hafiz said or daaud ibrahim se jude hai
 According to sources, these questions are being asked to Tunda
 
 
 bharat main lashkar ne apane kitne sleeper cell bana rakhe hai?bharat main lashkar-e-taiyaba ke sleeper cell kahaan-kahaan hai?lashkar kaa sleeper cell bharat main kiske ishaare par kaam karata he?lashkar-e-taiyaba kaa bharat main aatank kaa aglaa target koun he?bharat main kahaan-kahaan hamale kii sajeesh rach rahaa he lashkar?dilli police chaahati he ki lashkar ke network ke khulaase ke saath hi daaud ibrahim kaa kaccha-chittha bhi khul jaae, taaki abtak bharat ke sabooton ko nakaarte aae pakistan kii bolti band ho jaae
 That is why Tunda is also being asked questions related to Dawood
 enie or khufia agenciyon ne daaud ko lekar tunda se ye sawaal kiye
 
 
 Where is Dawood Ibrahim's network spread in India? Where is Dawood still hiding in Pakistan? What plot of terror was Tunda coming to India? Where are the explosives and weapons of terror conspiracy? What explosives and weapons in India? Have been brought? Intelligence agencies fear that Tunda's intention to come to India was to carry out a major terrorist act, so it is necessary to open Tunda's tongue as soon as possible

 Shia Waqf Board Chairman Wasim Rizvi said, "for the five acres of land that has been given to him, if he refuses to take it, we will request him to give that land to the Shia Waqf Board
 shiya vakf board vahaan ek bahut bada aspataal banayega, jisamen ek masjid bhi hogi
 There will also be a small temple
 ek girijaghar bhi hoga, ek gurudwara bhi hoga or sabhi dharm ke logon kaa vahaan nishulk ilaaj kiya jayega
 ' shahbaano ke mukademe se lekar teen talaak ke masale tak personal lau board jo kah detaa tha use desh ke musalamaanon kii awaja mana jaataa tha
 But on the Ayodhya issue, a large number of people in the country are questioning the move of the Personal Law Board and this is necessary for maintaining democracy in any democratic system

 Speaking in the Lok Sabha on the issue of reservation for economically poor upper castes, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that he has no problem with this
 unhone kaha ki vah pehle se hi garib savarnon ke liye kota die jane kii maang karte rahe hai jise modi sarkaar ne puraa kiya he
 The Minister said that members of scheduled castes and tribes and other backward classes are getting special opportunities in education and government jobs
 savarna samaaj ke log isaki aalochana karte the, lekin ab unhen bhi aarakshan die jane kii kavayad kii ja rahi he
 Now the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Center should get a chance again
 asal main, saamaanya varg ke liye aarakshan ko moort rup dene ke liye mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main samvidhan sandhodhan vidheyak pesh kiya gaya
 Taking part in the discussion in this regard, Ram Vilas Paswan said that reservation will be strengthened by giving reservation to opponents
 unhone kaha ki jab mandal ayog kii siforishein lagu kii ja rahi thim tab bhi yah baat uthi thi ki aarthik rup se kamjor savarnon ko bhi rigerveshan diya jaae lekin baat nahin ban pai
 Narasimha Rao had also tried to give quota to the upper castes even during his prime ministership, but the court overturned the case
 kendriya mantri paswan ne modi sarkaar ko dhanyavad dete hue kaha ki jab mandal kamishan kii siforishein lagu kii gai thim, us samay puure desh main uskaa virodh hua tha
 But those opposing could not be given a reservation because they were not governed by Article 16-4 of the Constitution
 agar aarthik rup se kamjor savarnon ko aarakshan dene se obisi or essi / asti ke aarakshan dene par koi fark nahin padataa he to isamen buraai kya he?paswan ne kaha ki obisi or essi / asti ko hi keval aarakshan mil rahaa tha
 Many parties had demanded from time to time that economically backward upper castes should also be brought under the purview of reservation
 is sarkaar ne isi prayaas ko moort rup diya he
 Giving reservation to the upper castes will end its opposition and the reservation will become stronger
 mantri ne yah baat bhi uthaai ki anusuchit jati janajati atyaachaar nivaaran adhinium yani essi / asti act ko court ne kamjor kar diya tha
 The government immediately amended the constitution and reverted it to the same form
 iske khilaaf savarnon ne puure desh main virodh kiya, isse pehle essi / asti ke logon ne april main pradarshan kiya jisamen 12 log maare gaye
 There was a feeling of discontent in the minds of the Savarnas from all these incidents
 paswan ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ek-ek mudde ko nipta rahi he
 Under this, economically weaker upper castes have been brought under the purview of reservation

 The controversy over the proposal to return Rajiv Gandhi Bharat Ratna has become so deep that now mlas and ministers of the Aam Aadmi Party are distancing themselves from government programs

 The question arises that after the Rajiv Gandhi Bharat Ratna controversy, which started from the Delhi Legislative Assembly on Friday, the ministers and legislators are keeping distance from the government program? Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goyal, when asked questions, first said that the Chief Minister did not attend the program, "I have no message whether he is in Delhi or not
" aksar wo kaarykram main aate hai lekin jaruri nahi ki vah har kaarykram main aaen
 Although it is necessary to have a president, i have come
 "kaarykram se vidhayakon kii gaiyr maujuudagi par bhi vidhansabha spikar safai dete najar aae
 He said, "there is nothing that the mlas are keeping away from the assembly program
 kal 25 disambar he
 The MLA may be on leave or out
 is bare main tippanee karnaa sahi nahin
 "at the same time, Speaker Ram Niwas Goel also spoke on the controversy arising out of Rajiv Gandhi's proposal to return the Bharat Samman
 unhone kaha ki "main bahut alert tha, koi bhul-chook nahin hui
 This subject was very emotional
 mere paas jo sankalp aayaa tha, usamen rajeev gandhi shabd kahin nahin tha
 The proposal which Jarnail Singh read, was not given to me as an amendment, so i did not have to raise this issue
 maine sanshodhit shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 Although they can definitely say that i should have interrupted Jarnail Singh at that time, but if i had interrupted many members would stand in his favor, this would have created a dilemma

 a bulletin will also be released today

 Taking a dig at Ajay Maken, he said that Ajay feels sorry for Maken
 wo vidhansabha ke kisi kaarykram main aate nahin hai
 The Legislative Assembly completed 25 years but did not attend that program even though their government has been in Delhi for many years

 Speaking at the inaugural session of Sahitya Mahakumbh organized by Aaj Tak, Bollywood's famous lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar said that there should be a nationwide debate on the Common Civil Code and decisions should be taken on the basis of the Constitution
 jo samvidhan ke viruddh he, use khaarij kar diya jaae
 Javed Akhtar said that he prefers to walk the middle path instead of flowing with one-sided extremism and he gets inspiration from Mahatma Buddha
 dil chahta he satr main bolte huejaved akhtar ne kahaaki kavita or shaayari ke liye agar sayam or shaayar kaa hawala dena pade to iskaa matlab he ki kavita adhuri he
 Poetry may be inspired by an event or time, but it is wrong to tie it to the same extent
 is kaarykram main jahaan unhone shrotaaon ke dilon ko tatola vahiin apane dil kii baton ko sabake saamne kaha
 The moderator of the session was Punya Prasun Vajpayee
 unhone unase kai chubte or gudgudate sawaal puche
 1
 aapaki lekhnee main hameshaa baghawat dikhti he, aap yah sab kaise kar lete hai?dekhie jo parampara yaa ravaayat he
 If you question him, he is called a rebellion
 sthapit niyamon par sawaal khadey karnaa baghawat kii shrenee main aa jaataa he

 Today, borrowing has also started
 pehle middle class kii ek limit hoti thi
 The fridge was kept in the drawing room
 aaj samaaj tarakkee kar gaya he
 Everyone has cars in the middle class

 How do you see the difference between the old generation and the new generation? When i look at my grandmother's age and look at my daughter, it seems as if both are creatures of different planets
 puraani peedi kii kahavatein khatm ho rahi hai
 With this generation, you will not dance, the courtyard will be crooked, nor will there be nine mind oil, nor are the stories like Radha Nachegi ending
 4
 See what you say on society, politics and language, even leaders are the birth of our society
 ham lekhak bhi to isi samaaj ko dekhte-parakhte hue hi likhte hai
 Leaders also pick things up while watching things from here
 5
 Do you think words are important? People need a beat to dance
 west ke beet par aadhaarit mujeec or hindustan ke sangeet main fark he
 Here people keep banging on the beat and words do not reach them
 6
 Bob Dillon also received Noble Literature, people have different opinions? Dillon's songs created a new kind of anti-war wave within America
 uske geet kranti kaa geet ban gaye
 Climbed people's tongues in such a way that they didn't come 7
 Did technology expand things? First established things oppose new things
 jaise jab germany main pehali baar priting press aayaa to vahaan logon ne iskaa bhi virodh kiya
 Every new thing is opposed
 8
 What do you say about the evils prevailing within the society? i believe that triple talaq should be stopped with immediate effect, but instead of creating a situation without causing a clash, the government should first bring the draft and debate it widely 
 anuvanshik sampatti main adhikaar die jaaen
 It has always been my belief that the final law is the Indian Constitution
 9
 What is the difference in the script of the earlier times and in today's era, what would you say? People who used to play applause on hearing earlier things or dialogues should be disputed today
 iskaa matlab he ki desh badal rahaa he?mujhe apane desh par puraa vishwaas he
 This will not change
 badalegaa to achche ke liye badalegaa

 aap hameshaa bich ke raste par chalane kii koshish karte hai
 This is very dangerous

 People are talkative when they speak more
 idhar yaa udhar zyada chale jane par chijen gadabada jaati hai

 aam aadmi party (AAP) ne centre kii modi sarkaar par ek baar phir sautele vyavhaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 AAP party spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj has also targeted the BJP, questioning an EPCA report related to Metro Phase 4
 unhone kaha ki pichley kuch dinon main metro phej 4 ko lekar centre sarkaar or dilli sarkaar ke bich kai baar patrachaar hue
 In this regard, the EPCA has also submitted a report to the Supreme Court, which the Aam Aadmi Party suspects
 saurabh bharadwaj ne aarope lagaaya, 'jis prakaar se EPCA ne apni report supreme court main rakhi he, usko lekar mere man main andeh paidaa hua he
 If we read the report submitted by the EPCA carefully, it is clearly visible that the entire report is leaning towards the BJP
 'AAP netaa saurabh bharadwaj ke mutabik dilli sarkaar ne metro phej 4 ke sambandh main do baaten rakhi he
 The first is that for the metro purchased in Phase One, Two and Three, Delhi Government gives half the money and the Central Government gives half the money
 doosraa yah ki metro ko chalaane main jo bhi ghaataa hota tha, usko bhi centre sarkaar or dilli sarkaar aadha-aadha vahan karte the
 However, it is very surprising that now in Metro Phase 4, the central government says that the Delhi government should pay all the money for the land to be purchased for the metro
 saath hi metro ko chalaane main jo bhi ghaataa ho, wo bhi sara ghaataa dilli sarkaar hi vahan kare, jo katai thik nahin he
 Saurabh Bhardwaj said that when it comes to increasing the fare in the metro, the central government says that we will take a decision
 jab metro main mahilaon ke liye muft yatra kaa mudda hota he, to centre sarkaar kahati he ki is par nirnay ham lenge
 But when it comes to buying land for Metro Phase 4, the Central Government says that Delhi Government will give all the money
 metro ke sanchaalan main hone vaale ghate ko bhi dilli sarkaar vahan karegi
 He said that such behavior of the central government is inhuman and unconstitutional
 aage EPCA par saal uthaate hue saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha, 'ek taraf to EPCA kahati he ki metro dilli ke liye behad jaruri he
 This will reduce pollution levels in Delhi
 duusari ore jab dilli sarkaar metro ke liye 6 coridor banane kaa prastaav detii he, to EPCA sirf teen coridor banane kii baat karti he
 When the Delhi government is ready to pay for 6 corridors, why build only three corridors? ' He said that this is because the central government wants this
 unhone kaha ki is puure maamle ko gaur se dekha jaae to aisa lagata he ki EPCA centre sarkaar ke adheen aane vaala ek santhaan ban gaya he
 Questioning the report submitted by the EPCA, Saurabh Bhardwaj said that according to the EPCA report, 3 out of these 6 corridors do not require metro
 EPCA kaa kahana he ki lajpat nagar se saket, indralok se indraprastha, rithala se bavana hote hue narela tak metro kii jarurat nahin he
 The EPCA and the central government are talking about only 3 phases
 in teenon jagahon par rahane vaale dillivaasiyon ko metro kii sevaaon se vanchit kiya ja rahaa he
 Secondly, all the money of Delhi Government comes from the taxpayers of Delhi, so why does the Central Government want to increase the burden on the taxpayers of Delhi by putting all the expenses of these corridors on the Delhi Government? At present, in the whole case, Aam Aadmi Party leader Saurabh Bhardwaj has appealed to the chairman of EPCA to reconsider by writing a letter
