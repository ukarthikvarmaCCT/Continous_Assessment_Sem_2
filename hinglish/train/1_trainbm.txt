 Nirav Modi has been absconding for the last nearly 15 months by licking banks worth Rs 13,000 crore
 neerav modi kii sajeesh kii vajah se pienbi bank kii aarthik raftaar ruk gai thi
 The stock was rolled and reached the ground

 However, after the arrest, Nirav Modi now has the option of conditional bail from the court
 neerav modi par kya-kya aarope- neerav modi ne ghotaale ko anjaam dene ke liye bank ke kuch karmchaariyon ko mila liya tha

 - saal 2011 main neerav modi or unke saathiyon ne bina taraashe hue heere aayaat karne ko line of credit ke liye punjab neshnal bank kii ek branch se sampark saadhaa tha
 In fact, the bank usually issues Letter of Undertaking (lou) for payments related to imports from abroad
 iskaa ye matlab he ki bank neerav modi ke videsh main maujuud saplir ko 90 din tak ke liye bhugtan karne ke liye raji ho gaya tha or baad main paisa neerav modi ko chukaana tha
 - Nirav Modi and his maternal uncle Mehul Choksi acquired all the lous from the year 2011, to repay the debt from them, then in the following years, they took new lous and secured loans through them
 is tarah ek lou se karj lene or phir is karj ko chukaane ke liye nae aloyu hasil karne ke liye parde ke peeche puraa gorakhdhandha chal rahaa tha

 It is believed that to stop the factionalism of the state Congress, it may be decided to bring a new president from outside, for this, the discussion of Navjot Singh Sidhu's name is intensified

 The Peshawarhai Court, taking the matter seriously, ordered the jailer to increase the security of Hamid
 jail incharge ne court ko kaha ki ham puri koshish karenge ab dobaaraa hamalaa naa ho

 After Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia also reiterated on Saturday that Aam Aadmi Party's talk to Sidhu, who was a star cricketer, commentator and Rajya Sabha MP from BJP, has not deteriorated yet
 siddhu ne sochane ke liye thodaa or vakt maanga he
 However, sources reveal that even before the curdling of Sidhu and Kejriwal's relationship has spread, Raita has spread conflict of interest in both
 siddhu punjab kaa siem banane kaa khwab ankhon main liye aam aadmi party kaa daaman thaamne aae the or kejariwal ke chinis maanjha ne unke khwaabon kii patang udne se pehle hi kaat di
 When Siddhu joins the AAP, the suspensor says that inside news is that Kisiddhuna is left of the house and not of the ghat
 bijepi kii rajyasabha sadsyta se unhone pehle hi istipha de diya he or aam aadmi party unhen punjab ke mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane se peeche hat chuki he
 Now the deal left with Navjot Singh Sidhu and his wife is that after winning the election, the Aam Aadmi Party will give Sidhu's wife a place in the cabinet and Sidhu will have the responsibility to take the party forward to the center
 ab isse behatar sauda siddhu ke liye congress ke paas he
 The Congress will not only give a place in the cabinet after winning his wife, but also Sidhu's favorite Amritsar seat
 captain amarinder singh se pehle siddhu hi amritsar se saansad the or akaliyon ke dabaav main siddhu ko amritsar se tikat nahin mili thi
 But the question is that the Congress ideology and party against which Sidhu has fought throughout his political life, will not his supporters stop him from holding on to it now? Sidhu will not run on Ankush Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab elections last year Sources working with the state say that the biggest negative point with Sidhu is that he has been convicted in the court
 aam aadmi partike samvidhan ke mutabik aise kisi vyakti ko chunaav kaa tikat nahin diya ja saktaa, mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar bananaa to dur kii baat he
 The second negative point is that Sidhu is an elephant without curb
 bijepi main bhi unke bayaan bina laag lapet ke hote hai
 On the other hand, along with becoming the Chief Minister, there were some other conditions of Sidhu on which Kejriwal did not agree
 mukhyamantri ke pad kii maang ke baad usamen sabase badi thi nishchit sankhya main tikat ke bantwaare par nirnaayak raay
 Simultaneously Sidhu wanted to join the Aam Aadmi Party with one of his team, on which you supremo did not agree
 to kya siddhu kahin ke nahin rahe?amadmi party kii siddhu ke saath or siddhu kii aam aadmi party ke saath nahin ban rahi to ab bijepi kii rajyasabha seat chhod chuke cricketer ke paas kya vikalp he? teenon partiyon main se sabase aakarshak deal congress ke paas he, to kya apni rashtravaadi raajnneetik soch kii dhar kund kar siddhu congress ke saath chale jaaenge
 Obviously, it is very difficult for Sidhu to choose this option
 takneekee taur par siddhu ne ab tak sirfrajyasabhaase hi istipha diya he, party kii praathmik sadsyta se nahin, to kya siddhu apni rahi sahi izzat bachaakar bijepi main hi waapas chale jaaen? ye vikalp bhi ankhon dekhi makkhi nikalne se kam nahin, kyonki bijepi main waapas jane ke baad siddhu kii pratishtha kitni bachegi, ye unase behatar koi nahin jaanata
 The third option is to wrap up the remaining deal of the Aam Aadmi Party
 kejariwal jo bhi den, wo lekar kejariwal kii nai raajnneeti kaa jhandabardaar ban jaaen
 Sidhu's new party in Punjab elections? a fourth option is that in Punjab elections, Sidhu gets down with a new party and brings a lot of dent to Kejriwal's prospects, and also show his power and get closer to BJP
 haalanki antertenment industry se judi siddhu kii patibaddhta or part time raajnneeti karne kii unki aadat dekhakar ye vikalp star cricketer ke liye utana praayogic nahin lagata
 But we should also not forget that in cricket and politics, the game can change in a few minutes

 sutron ne bataaya ki inamen kuch bank aise hai jo ki atirikt tear-1 (anti -1) bond dharakon ko byaaj bhugtan karne kii vajah se vittiya dabaav main aae hai
 That is why they are at risk of failing to meet regulatory capital requirements
 bank dirghakaalik puunji jutaney ke vaaste kaaphi lambii avadhi ke anti -1 jaise bond jari karte hai jinpar aakarshak byaaj diya jaataa he
 The Finance Ministry has decided to provide capital to four-five banks facing such severe financial constraints
 fanse karj or badhate ghate kaa saamana kar rahervajanik kshetra ke bainkonke puunji aadhaar main sudhaar laane ke liye sarkaar ne in bainkon ko do saal main 2

 In this country, the scale on which there has been a change in the relationship between men and women in the last ten years was not even in the last 3,000 years

 All the means like cable TV, Facebook, Twitter, youtube, chat rooms, online porn have taken the dreams of younger generation as if

 In the age group of 18 to 24 years, this figure is about 75 percent
 ab 13 kii umr main pyaar karne or 16 kii umr main sex ke maamle ajooba nahin hai
 Sex has passed out of closed doors
 shaharon main choti-si saiyr main bhi sex ke uttejk ishtihaar dikh jaaenge
 Bollywood films also show the same openness in terms of express sex
 jis parade par dashakabar pehle dur se chumban ke ishaaron tak par kanchi chal jaati thi, ab dhadlle se sex seen dikhaae ja rahe hai
 Pornography is available everywhere

 This is the highest personal score in the history of World Cup as well as the record for hitting the most sixes
 isse pehle worldcup main nau chakke maarane kaa record south africa ke ballebaaj david miller ke naam tha
 Chris Gayle also set a record in today's match
 worldcup main sabase zyada 136 ran boundary se aae jo ki ek world record he
 Earlier this record was in the name of Saurabh Ganguly
 ganguli ne 26 may 1999 ko srilanka ke khilaaf shandaar 183 ranon kii pari kheli thi or 110 ran boundary se liye the jis main 17 chaukke or saat chakke shaamil the
 Gayle, who came to the opening, got off to a slow start, but later battered the Zimbabwean bowlers with great batting
 yah worldcup ke itihaas main pehla doharaa shatak he
 However, if the World Cup is abandoned, Rohit Sharma holds the record for most runs in a one-day match
 rohit ne srilanka ke khilaaf shandaar 264 ranon kii pari kheli thi

 What can be the biggest improvement in Jaitley's budget, there is no need to get into much trouble
 bas un paragraph ko dhyaan se suniyegaa jahaan rail bajet ke aam bajet main vilay kaa zikr ho rahaa ho, kyonki tazaadam sudhaaron kii sabase badi ummid isi vilay se judi he
 Do not be mistaken in the fact that the merger of the railway budget into the general budget is a big improvement by itself
 yah darasal aakhri vikalp tha kyon ki railway kaa nayaa nizaam pichley do saal main bharat ke sabase bade transporter ko apane pairon par khadaa nahin kar sakaa, natijatan use jetali ke kandhe par bitha diya
 However, this merger should initiate those drastic reforms in the railway that politics has been avoided by reasoning
 beete baras sitambar main jab hamane rail bajet ke aam bajet main vilay ko lekar rail mantri suresh prabhu ko tatolane kii koshish kii thi to vah jhunjhala uthe the
 We wanted to know what the railways would gain from this merger and what kind of reforms would start in the railways
 lekin rail mantri bataanaa chaahate the ki duniya ke kisi desh main rail bajet alag nahin to bharat main kyon hona chahie? haalanki baad ke maheenon main bhi is vilay ke ke bare main kuch thos suna nahin gaya or duusari taraf rail bhawan ke galiyaaron se lekar lekar sudur ilaakon tak faile rail network main is vilay ko lekar utsukata va romaanch badhata gaya he
 It is not only that the tradition of the budget is going off but it also goes further and questions related to the operation, financial restructuring and autonomy of the railway are being eagerly awaited for the answers
 railway or vitt mantralay ke rishte pechida hai:§railway koi company nahin he, phir bhi sarkaar ko labhaansh detii he
 The Railways is in deficit, so it is not the dividend but the interest on the budgeted debt
 §ek haath se railway sarkaar ko ''labhaansh" detii he to duusare haath se aam bajet se madad leti he
 This help is for the expansion and modernization of the railway network, as the railways do not have the resources for network expansion after paying daily expenses, salary, pension and interest
 §railway ke tahat kai companiyaan hai, jinhen alag se kendriya khajaane se vittiya madad milti he
 Apart from the help from the budget, the Railways has to take huge loans, for which the Indian Railway Finance Corporation is
 bharat main railway akelaa sarkari vibhaag he jiske paas karj ugaahne vaali company he, jo railway ko wagon-dibba aadi ke liye karj sansaadhan detii he
 Railway under the leadership of Prabhu has also taken loan from Life Insurance Corporation, which is very expensive
 railway kii mali haalat kaa kya kahana:·suresh prabhu pichley saal railway kii do sabase phydemand sevaaon ko nichod liya
 First, freight increased on coal
 railway kaa lagbhag 50 fisadi dhulaai rajasav koyale se aata he
 Surge pricing in premium trains was then increased by demand, and thus the railway stuck in a deep financial crisis put its competitiveness at stake
 ·railway lagaataar aisi company hoti ja rahi he jo apana kaarobaar (maal or yatri) anya kshetron ko saunpna chaahati he taaki ghaataa kam kiya ja sake
 The merger of the railway budget into the general budget is not such a big deal
 More big news will be the restructuring programs of the railways which are announced in the budget, because the purpose of merging the budgets cannot be to change the railways to the government department
 aaiye dekhte hai vah paanch sudhaar jinka elaan rail bajet ke aam bajet main vilay ke saath hona jaruri he -pehlaicounting sudhaaron ke jariye railway kii saamaajik jimmedaariyon ko vanijyik kaarobaar se alag karnaa or saamaajik sevaaon ke liye bajet se paardarshee sabsidido-saamaajik sevaaon ko alag karne ke baad railway kii aarthik sevaayen bachengi
 In which the policy of increasing the freight and fare according to the cost and the formation of an independent fare regulator, disinvestment of three railway hospitals and schools so as to save expenses and get resources
 chaar-debaroy samiti kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par railway ke transport sanchaalan or buniyadi dhaanche ko alag companiyon main badla jaae or railway ke saarvajanik upakramon ke liye ek holding company kaa gathanpanch-railway kii nai companiyon main nijee nivesh yaa vinievesh ke jariye share bazaar main soochibaddh karaayaa jaae jaisaa ki doorsanchaar seva vibhaag ko beasenel main badal kar kiya gaya tha

 BJP leader Uma Bharti reiterated her controversial warning to set the Walmart stores on fire, saying that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati could also be sent to jail on Monday in a corruption case
 pradesh kii mukhyamantri va bahujan samaaj party (basapa) adhyaksh mayawati ne bhi khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh kaa virodh kiya he
 Bharti said, 'when i can be jailed for setting Walmart stores on fire, Mayawati can also be jailed for misusing public money and for corrupt activities
 'unhone kaha, 'ham donon ko hi alag-alag kaarnon se jail bheja ja saktaa he
 One for helping the poor and the other for cheating on them
 ' unhone aarope lagaaya ki mayawati khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh kaa jhootha virodh kar khud ko garibon kii maseehaa ke rup main pesh karne kii koshish kar rahi hai
 Bharti said that Mayawati herself is controlled by the capitalists and is involved in looting the poor in the state
 unhone kaha ki isliye pratyaksh videshi nivesh ke unke virodh kii mayawati ke virodh se tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 Describing Mayawati as an enemy of Dalits and backward castes, she said, "even after claiming to be the protector of her own Dalits, she has failed to work for the people and backward castes of her community
 mayawati dalit mahilaon ko nyaay dilaane main bhi asafal rahi hai balki unke shashan ke dauraan unhen or nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 He said, 'mayawati government is very insensitive like a stone elephant (bsp's election symbol)
 jis tarah yah hathi nahin chal saktaa usee tarah mayawati main bhi garibon or suvidhahinon ke liye koi bhavanaaen nahin hai
 ' himachal pradesh main guuruuvaar ko matdaan nipatane ke baad gujarat chunaav par puri tarah focus aa tikega
 The eyes of the world are focused not only on the Gujarat elections, but also in the country
 bijepi, khaas taur par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye ye chunaav saakh kaa sawaal he, vahiin congress bhi 22 saal baad gujarat kii satta main vaapasi kii ummid liye apane tarkash kaa har tir aajmaana chaahati he
 The Congress is trying to cross the electoral storm with the help of PODA in Gujarat
 ‘poda’ ke tamil main myne ‘chal hat’ hote hai
 But for Gujarat elections, it means p-patidar, O-OBC, d-dalit and a-adivasi
 congress edi chotii kaa jor laga rahi he ki is jaateey sameekaran se bijepi ko gujarat main satta se 'poda' kar diya jaae
 The second thing is that the Congress did not have strong leaders from these castes in the party itself to help Poda
 aise main congress baahar se in jatiyon ke kaddavar netaa chunakar unke ‘congresikaran’ ke jariye BJP ko patkhni dene kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 In fact, the Congress, taking a lesson from the Uttar Pradesh elections earlier this year, decided that it would do its best not to let the Gujarat elections go on the line of communal polarization
 congress acchhee tarah jaanati he ki agar aisa hua to bijepi usko patkhni de degi
 This is the reason why Congress and Rahul Gandhi have been holding the line of 'soft Hindutva' for Gujarat for the past several weeks
 rahul gandhigujrat main prachaarke liye jitani baar bhi gaye, tamaam devi devataaon ke mandiron main darshan karte najar aae, mahanton se aashirwad lete dikhe or nav durga pandalon main aarti karte najar aae
 On the other hand, even if Rahul went to minority dominated areas in Bharuch, he did not visit any of his places of worship
 kul milakar congress kii mashkkat saaf najar aati he ki BJP ko gujarat chunaav ko hindu-musalmaan line par le jane kaa koi mauka naa diya jaae
 Congress is running a two-tier plan for Gujarat
 upree taur par congress kii kaman sanbhale rahul gandhi ‘soft hindutv’ kaa jhanda thame dikhen, usee disha main kadam uthaate najar aaen
 Rahul is also doing this
 vahiin andarkhaanecongress kii koshishkatter hindutv kii bhaavana ko todane ke liye bina koi hallaa kiye jatvaad kaa astr istemaal karne kii he
 This is the reason that the Congress wants to further the votes of these castes by putting forward the Patidar, OBC, Dalit and tribal leaders
 vaise jaateey samikarnon par tike formulon kii baat kii jaae to uttar pradesh or bihar main MY (yani muslim or yadav) ne bahut surkhiyaan batori thim
 Talking about Gujarat, the current state president of Congress Bharat Singh Solanki's father Madhav Singh Solanki played the stakes of KHAM (kshatriya, Harijan, Adivasi, Muslim) in the 1985 state assembly elections
 gujarat ke us chunaav main congress ko 149 siton par jeet hasil hui thi
 However, the fact of the sympathy wave for the Congress that resulted from the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984 for that victory cannot be ignored
 ‘khaam’ ke hi 2017 sanskaran ke taur par hicongress gujaratmen ‘poda’ par daanv laga rahi he
 The Congress feels that Muslims were an important part in 'kham' and 'poda' are Patidars
 patidaar paramparaagat taur par BJP kii ridh maane jate rahe hai isliye congress kaa puraa jor unhen apni taraf laane par he
 As far as Muslims are concerned, the Congress is agreeing, the Muslims will support it against the BJP
 ‘poda’ kitna kargar rahata he, ye congress ke khud ke karishme se adhik is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki patidaar netaa hardik patel, obisi netaa alpesh thakor, dalit netaa jignesh mewaani or adivasee netaa chotu singh vasava kis had tak apni jatiyon main paith ko congress ke haq main voton main tabdeel kar sakate hai
 Chhotu Singh Vasava is the same MLA whose vote helped Congress veteran Ahmed Patel win the recent Rajya Sabha election from Gujarat
 kehane ko vasava jediu ke vidhayak hai lekin ab wo nitish kumaar ke saath nahin balki sharad yadav kheme ke saath hai
 Be it 'MY', 'KHAM' or the Congress' new 'PODA' for Gujarat, these are the caste equations that are clicked in the elections and keep on tongue for years
 or agar ‘flop sho’ sabit hote hai to ateet kii tarah hi siyaasi dhundh main kho jate hai
 For the Congress to know whether the stake of 'PODA' will be a hit or a flop, one has to wait till the Gujarat election results are out on 18 December

 Hundreds of people had a fair in May 2014 in Mehendipur, a village in Banaras

 Just ask whom he was desperate to get a glimpse of mother
 aakhir ye mata ji hai koun? jaise-jaise logon kii bheed bad rahi thi meri jigyaasa bhi badhati ja rahi thi
 Eventually the wait was over and Mata ji was in front of everyone
 par yah kya? yah koi aurat nahin balki purush tha
 People believed that the mother enters their body
 purush mata ji lagaataar apana sir patake rahe the
 And there were slogans of Jai Mata ji around
 vahaan maujuud harek vyakti ko yah bharosa tha ki mata ji asaadhya se asaadhya beemaari, daridrata samet har tarah kii takaliphen khatm kar sakati hai
 When the curiosity to research his history grew, he started questioning
 darasal is vyakti par teen saal pehle mata ji aana shuru huin or phir har navadurgon main mata ji us par savaar ho jaatin
 People started bringing heavy offerings with darshan there
 teen saal pehle ek chote se makaan main rahane vaala yah vyakti ab tak do bangalon kaa maalik ho chukaa tha
 He took the land of the government pond by building a temple
 buniyadi jaruraton ke liye mohataaj rahe bachche or patni ab sampannataa kii jindagi ji rahe the
 But no one was asking them, from where did all this come to them? Did that person have any psychological illness or were they tricking people? The second thing was more likely to be true
 kya is tarah kii harakatein karne vaale vyakti main vaaki koi manovikruti hoti he?jips cychetric hospital or diediction centre evam colombia asia hospital main senior psychologist pratibha yadav kahati hai, '' kuchhek maamalon main vyakti vaaki manovikruti kaa shikaar hota he lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main log jaanboojhkar logon ko bargalaate hai

 mlas and ministers also took photographs with him
 aise desh main jab buraadi jaisi ghatana ghatati he to iske dharmik, tantric, aapraadhik or manovaigyanik taar khoje jate hai
 It is true that no normal person can execute an incident like Burari
 lekin dharm kii ek apni hi abhaasi duniya main funsane kaa chalan bhi to samaaj main panpi soch se hi paidaa hota he
 Where leaders, actors, journalists and educated people of the society trust such things, then such beliefs take their roots
 ham bhramit karne vaale abhaason ko sach maanakar unhen kisi adrishy shakti kaa sandesh maan baithte hai
 The incident of Burari is one of the world's most rare psychological events
 aisa nahin he ki aisi ghatnaon ke udhaaharan nahin he

 Yet such incidents only rarely occur, but the incidence of being caught in the web of religion keeps happening

 He was the head of the household after the father's death
 isliye ghar ke saare log uske har faisle ko maanate the
 But assuming his illusion to be true, the fantasy of some otherworldly sensation embracing the hanging noose put the whole family to sleep
 gurukul kangri main manovigyaan ke professor seepi khokhar kehete hai, ''darasal lalit ko dilugen of grandyur yani mahanata kaa vaham or dilugen of percicution yani apane ird-gird apane hi khilaaf sajeesh hone kaa vaham hone kii beemaari thi
 '' Lalit used to hear some voices

 He felt that the soul of his dead father gives him some instructions
 professor khokhar kehete hai, ''vah saalon se is manahosthiti se guzar rahaa tha
 But no one outside realized this

 behatar vikalp mili to mahendra singh dhoni bhartiya test team kii captaini chhodane ko taiyaar hai
 Dhoni said that a better person should be selected as an alternative for this
 videshi dharti par apni captaini main mili lagaataar aath haar ke baad dhoni par captaini chhodane kaa dabaav bad gaya he
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, the Indian team has lost four matches each in England and Australia
 dhoni ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki captaini aisi jimmedaari hoti he, jis par kisi kaa ekadhikaar nahin hota
 This responsibility should be given to the one who is most suitable for the leadership of the team at that time
 dhoni ne kaha, "yah mere liye ek atirikt jimmedaari or bhoomika he
 Not everyone can occupy this place
 yah jimmedaari mujhe saade teen saal pehle mili thi

 This is not a position that you can ask for according to your wish
 " After eight consecutive defeats under his captaincy on foreign soil, pressure has increased on Dhoni to give up the captaincy
 dhoni kii captaini main bhartiya team ko england or australia main chaar-chaar maichon main haar mili he
 Dhoni said on Tuesday that captaincy is a responsibility over which no one has a monopoly
 yah jimmedaari usee ko milani chahie jo us samay team ke netritv ke liye sabase upyukt ho
 Dhoni said, "this is an additional responsibility and role for me
 is sthaan par har koi kabiz nahin ho saktaa
 i got this responsibility three and a half years ago
 main is team ke saath behatar pradarshan kaa prayaas kar rahaa hum

 This appears to be from the report of N
 Ram published in 'the Hindu'
 en ram kehete hai ki prati vimaan 41
 42 percent higher prices are being purchased
 is report ko padhane ke baad lagata he ki keemton ko lekar sansad main hui bahes antim nahin he
 The Modi government argues that due to the terms of confidentiality of the agreement reached between India and France, the price cannot be disclosed
 magar us qaraar main kaha gaya he ki gopneeyata kii sharten raksha se sambandhit baton tak hi simit hai
 That is, the price can be stated
 keemat clacyphid soochna nahin he
 The military and civil officials briefed the media when the deal was made before the dispute and stated the price
 en ram bataate hai ki jab 2007 main dasson avishan ko lambii prakriya ke baad chunaa gaya tab yahi tay hua ki 18 vimaan susajjit avasthaa main aaenge or 108 hindustan aironotics limited taiyaar karegaa
 At that time the Dasas 79 for an aircraft
 3 million euro (642 karod rupee) maanga tha
 This price in 2011 is 100
 85 milayan euro (817 karod rupee) ho gai
 Of course, in 2016, the Modi government achieved a discount of 9 percent as per the 2011 prices, but that discount was for 36 aircraft, not 126 aircraft
 ek vimaan kii keemat tay hui 91
 75 million euros (rs 743 crore)
 yah puri kahani nahin he
 The major and second part of the story is that Das said that 1 to equip the aircraft according to India
 4 bilayan euro (11345 karod rupee) or dene honge
 India negotiated it 1
 3 billian euro (10536 karod rupee) par laayaa
 The Indian Air Force demanded that the Rafale aircraft should be equipped with 13 features to suit the needs of India
 iske liye 36 vimaanon ke liye 1
 It was agreed to pay 3 billion euros (rs 10536 crore)
 is hisaab se prati vimaan kii keemat hoti he 36
 11 million euros (rs 292 crore)
 2007 main isaki keemat thi 11
 11 million euros (90 crore rupees)
 vaayu sena ke jin visheshtaon kii maang kii thi unamem upie or modi sarkaar ke samay koi badlaav nahin aayaa tha
 'the Hindu' has seen several documents of the Ministry of Defense related to this deal
 rafaal vimaan saude ke liye saat sadasyon kii indian negoshiation team (INT) bani thi
 Its three members object to many things ranging from price
 inke har sawaal ko team ke baaki chaar sadsy kaarij kar dete hai
 Every time a decision is made by a difference of 4-3
 ye teen sadsy hai, sanyukt sachiv or equizishan manager rajeev verma, financial manager ajit sule, adwiser( cast) em pi singh
 They said that 1 separately to prepare according to the needs of India
 3 billian euro (10536 karod rupee) kii rakam bahut zyaada he
 The team rejected it and wrote that 1 to prepare 126 aircraft according to India
 4 billian euro (11345 karod rupee) diya janaa tha, usase kahin behatar he 36 vimaanon ke liye 1
 Giving 3 billion euros (rs 10536 crore)
 kya shandaar hisaab he! pradhanmantri ke netritv main raksha maamalon kii mantrimandal kii samiti ne team ke faisle par muhar laga di
 The INT report is reviewed by the Ministry of Law, Ministry of Finance and the Cabinet Committee on Defense Affairs
 sarkaar ne supreme court ko jo note diya he or jise yachikakartaon ko bhi diya gaya he, uske anusaar sarkaar ke note main raksha mantri manohan parrikar kii adhyakshata vaali raksha kareed parishad (DAC) kii kisi bhoomika kaa zikr nahin he
 How can this happen when the DAC only has the power to take decisions under the defense procurement process
 isliye hairaani kii baat nahin ki 10 april 2015 ko pradhanmantri modi ne jab paris main apni taraf se deal kaa elaan kar diya to raksha mantri khud ko anjaan bataa rahe the
 The basic question of N
 Ram is that the Indian government had many weapons to bargain for the price from Rafale, why they were not used
 4 july 2014 ko eurofiter ke sheersh adhikari ne raksha mantri arun jetali ko patr likhaa tha ki vah pehle se behatar kshamta se las 126 eurofiter 20 pratishat kam daam par de saktaa he
 It is also written in this letter that he was happy to offer this in response to the defense minister's request to his country's ambassador
 yani raksha mantri ne khud pahal kii thi
 While the INT Committee turned down Eurofighter's proposal, stating that Eurofighter had made the unsolicited proposal, the tender has been closed at this time and cannot be considered at this level in line with the rules
 cameti kaa yah faisla sahi tha yaa nahin, is par bahes ho sakati he lekin sarkaar ise lekar rafaal se mol bhav to kar hi sakati thi
 Eurofighter even went so far as to say that it would stop the supply of Germany, England, Spain and Italy and supply first, keeping in mind India's needs
 cameti ke teen sadasyon ne euro fiter ke is prastaav ko darj bhi kiya he ki 20 pratishat kam daam par vimaan de rahaa he
 The Air Force also tested the Eurofighter when the tender came out during the UPA
 yah jahaaz bhi bejod paaya gaya tha magar us vakt keemton ke kaaran pichad gaya
 Rafal entered into the deal by offering a lower price and left the deal to sell the ship at a higher price
 isse kis kis ko laabh hua, kise kitna paisa mila, is bare main abhi tak koi reporting saamne nahin ai he jaisaa ki boforce ke samay hua tha
 41 when Eurofighter was delivering the same capacity at 20 percent lower price
 42 pratishat adhik daam par rafaal se kyon kharida gaya
 Eurofighter also said that the company will build Eurofighter Industrial Park in India, run training programs and provide support
 rafaal ke saath hui nai deal main hindustan aironotics ko bhi baahar kar diya gaya jise pehle 108 jahaaz banane the
 N
 Ram says that a trade agreement is not made with Dasso Company
 do mulkon ke bich samjhauta hota he magar samprabhu guarantee nahin lee jaati he
 Then what is the point of agreement between two countries? The sovereign guarantee meant that the French government would take responsibility for everything
 yahi nahin tender band hone kii baat kar eurofiter ke prastaav ko thukraayaa gaya lekin pradhanmantri modi ne paris main jo elaan kiya wo to puri tarah se nai deal thi
 The earlier processes talked of 126 aircraft, now 36 were being purchased
 zaahir he us str par bhi keemton ko lekar molbhav ho saktaa tha
 n Ram has written that in 2007, a separate 1 to prepare 126 aircraft for India
 4 billian euro (11345 karod rupee) dene the
 1 to prepare 36 aircraft in 2016
 3 billian euro (10536 karod rupee) die jane kaa faisla hota he
 Even if you fail in mathematics, you can understand the difference where the game has happened
 is kaaran har vimaan keemat 25 million euro (202 karod rupee) bad jaati he
 France, of course, had given a 9 percent discount on the price of ordinary aircraft, but the cost of equipped aircraft was increased by 25 million euros (rs 202 crore)
 yahi nahin pehle ke pholo on claj ko hataa diya gaya
 Under this, 63 aircraft could be purchased on the basis and price of 126 aircraft
 ye claaj kisalie hataae gaye? kyon 36 vimaanon ko 41
 Purchased at 42 percent higher prices? bijepi ne jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla par prahaar karte hue poocha ki shaikh mohammad abdulla satta main rahete vakt swaittata ke mudde par chup kyon rahe

 And had full support of the Congress in the state assembly
 ’’ Explaining the stand of the then NDA government on autonomy, Singh said, "the answer is very simple that Advani was a member of the multi-party NDA government which also included Omar Abdullah and the BJP did not have enough numbers to do anything on Article 370

 The alliance of Congress and RJD in Bihar may seem strong on the ground, but the impact of Lalu Prasad Yadav's distance from Rahul and Sonia could spoil the political equation

 Recently, just like Rahul, Sonia Gandhi did not take Lalu Yadav's name in her Sasaram meeting

 khaas baat yah he ki rahul gandhi or sonia ne sirf un do chunavi kshetron main prachaar kiya he jahaan congress kii sthiti pehle se majboot he
 It is obvious that in such areas, the alliance needs Lalu and in the absence of Lalu, the coalition can stop

 However, Lehman later said to be serious, "it has been an exciting series
 jab tab sab kuch maidan main rahe tab tak hamen koi pareshaani nahin he
 We are happy that both the teams are playing tough cricket
 yah austrailia ke najariye se sukhad he kyonki ham aisa hi khel khelnaa chaahate hai
 But at the same time we want it to be left on the ground and not come out
 ’liman ne melbern cricket maidan par tisare test ke chauthe din pari kii ghoshnaa main deree karne ke liye apni team kii kisi bhi aalochana ko khaarij kiya
 The hosts declared the innings at lunch at a score of 318 for nine and gave India a target of 384 runs in 70 overs to win
 bharat ne iske jawaab main chah wicket par 174 ran banaae
 The coach said, 'we won the series, isn't it? yah hamaare liye kaaphi ahm tha
 But were we defensive
 yaa bharat apni ranneeti ko lekar rakshaatmak tha
 He gave us a chance to score runs and declared the innings and instead of chasing the target, five players were standing on the boundary
 ’ liman ne kaha, ‘bharat ne nai gend tak nahin lee
 We would have got a new ball
 unhone boundry par kaaphi fielders khadey kiye hue the or ham har over main ek yaa do ran hi bana paa rahe the
 It was not that we were stuck in that situation
 bas ham is tarah nahin khelte
 The coach also praised the team's young captain Steve Smith
 unhone kaha, ‘steve ne (pari ghoshit karne par) mere saath usee tarah baat kii jis tarah maaikel clark karata
 i believe in it that the captain should decide
 ant main hamen jeet darj karne ke liye 20 se 30 over kam mili

 Sitharaman's visit was done under a special strategy

 India is planning to tackle China's dangerous 'salute slicing' strategy
 raksha mantri sitaraman ne sikkim main kaha tha ki sena kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye sarkaar gambhirtha se kaam kar rahi he
 Sitharaman made it clear from his visit that India's emphasis will now be on the development of border areas
 in ilaakon main vikaas naa ho paane kii vajah se hi china ko yahaan pair pasaarne kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Defense Minister Sitharamanaki plans to develop infrastructure on the india-china border LAC (4057 km)
 salaami slising kaa matlab he- padosi desh ke khilaaf chupake-chupake chote-chote sainya abhiyaan chalaakar dhire-dhire kisi bade bubhaag par kabja kar lenaa
 Such campaigns are of such small scale that there is no possibility of turning them into war
 lekin padosi desh ke liye yah samajhnaa mushkil ho jaataa he ki aise abhiyaanon kaa kaise or kis tarah se jawaab diya jaae
 Such campaigns have enabled China to consolidate its hold in many areas

 Lack of infrastructure in these areas makes Indian forces disabled
 china kisalaami slising kii ranneetiisiilie or kargar ho paati he kyonki bharat ke seemaayi ilaakon main buniyadi sadaken tak bhi nahin hai
 At the same time, China has built railway networks, highways, roads, airbases, radars and all the infrastructure for its army in Tibet
 china ne ilaake main sena kii 30 tukadiyaan tainaat kar rakhi hai jisamen 15,000 sainik hai
 There are also 5-6 rapid reaction forces
 bharat is maamle main padosi desh china se bahut peeche chhot chukaa he
 15 years ago 73 roads (4,643 km) on LAC

 So far only 27 of these roads have been built
 yahi nahin, lambey samay se prastaavit 14 ranneeti railway lines bichaane kaa kaam ab tak shuru bhi nahin ho paaya he
 Army Chief Bipin Rawat had recently cautioned against this dangerous strategy of China
 uttar kii sthiti par bolte hue unhone kaha tha ki china ne apni takat dikhaani shuru kar di he
 'salami slicing', that is, gradually occupying the terrain, and testing the other's ability to bear
 unhone kaha tha ki yah hamaare liye chintaa kaa vishay he or hamen is prakaar kii paristhitiyon se nipatane ke liye ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie jinase bhavishya main gambhir takaraav paidaa ho saktaa he
 The development of infrastructure in border areas will not only prevent the increasing infiltration of China into India but also weaken its claim on disputed areas

 aise main kya musalmaan chup baitha rahe or majahab ko badnaam hone de? yaa wo khud islam ke sahi myne ko samajhe or dusron ko bataae ki julm or katlo gaharat karnaa islam nahin he
 This is a question! 'comments isse pehle qurbaani pratha apane vichaaron ke chalate bhi kuch logon kii aalochana kaa shikaar is bollywood sitare ko hona padaa tha

 a student studying in Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College has accused seniors of ragging
 post graduate first year kii chaatra ne isaki shikaayat dilli police se kii he
 The student says that seniors used to behave with her inappropriately from day one
 usne isaki shikaayat echodi se lekar college ke anti raging cell tak main kii
 But when no action was taken, it was done with the DCP of Central Delhi
 iske baad police ke kehane par neshnal anti ranging cameti ne maamle kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 In J&K, the jdu's problems have increased due to the bjp's strong opposition parties supporting the bill on the decision of the Central Government to remove Article 370
 kyonki usne endie main rahete hue bill par apni asahmati jataai
 While parties like bjp's biggest opposition party, Aam Aadmi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Telugu Desam, supported the Jammu and Kashmir amendment bill
 haalanki endie main rahete hue dhara 370, teen talaak, samaan achaar samhita or ram mandir ke mudde par jediu bijepi se apana stand 1996 se alag rakhti ai he
 But then the BJP did not have the power to run on its own, on its own sensitive matters
 ab samay badal chukaa he
 The JDU saved its honor by boycotting voting on the issue of triple talaq, but in the case of Article 370, it is troubled by the support of many opposing parties
 or to or ab party ke andar se bhi stand par punarvichaar karne kii maang uthne se party netritv soch main jarur he
 What KC tyagijdu National General Secretary K
 si
 Tyagi dissented on the bill and said that this is our stand till this time, what will happen next will decide the party's national president Nitish Kumar
 bihar main nitish kumaar kii sarkaar bijepi ke samarthan se chal rahi he, jabaki kendra main jediu narendra modi sarkaar ke samarthan main he, agar wo samarthan na bhi karen to kendra sarkaar ko koi fark nahin padegaa
 But may fall in Bihar
 haalanki bijepi nitish kumaar sarkaar se samarthan waapas nahin legi
 She would not like to withdraw support in a single stroke
 lekin itnaa to tay he ki 2020 ke vidhansabha chunaav main iskaa asar pad saktaa he
 BJP also knows that Nitish Kumar has his own stand, he cannot change it
 kai baar jediu voting kaa bahishkaar kar apratyaksh rup se bijepi ko phayda pahunchaati rahi he
 Experts say that even though the Janata dal-u has been indulging in various ways to maintain its old stand, in the end the BJP is benefiting from it
 ek taraf uske samarthan karne vaali virdohi partiyaan uske saath ho gai hai to duusari taraf endie main shaamil shivasena or jediu jaisi partiyaan dabaav main hai
 What will be the impact on the Bihar Assembly Elections? This year there is an election in Maharashtra and next year in Bihar, obviously by taking advantage of such issues, BJP can also succeed in exercising its dominance over these allies
 aise main jediu ke andar se bhi stand par punarvichaar karne kii baat uthne lagi he
 Party leader and former spokesperson Ajay Alok has tweeted and appealed to the party's national president Nitish Kumar to reconsider the stand of section 370, while another MLA Amarnath Gami wrote on Facebook tauntingly that there are regional parties themselves, one Two states show influence, yet minorities oppose the removal of Article 370 due to appeasement
 dhanyavad ke paatr hai
 Seeing public sentiment, it was good that all the parties of the country would come to the side

 Because Salman's previous release film Tubelight proved to be a flop at the box office
 phans salmaan kii tiger jinda he ko saal kii blockbster hit hone vaali film qaraar de rahe hai
 The sequel of Salman's Ek Tha Tiger film released in 2012, Tiger Zinda Hai, is going to be released on Christmas this year
 is film main brake ap ke baad ek baar phir salmaan katrina caff ke saath romance karte najar aaenge
 Salman reduced the weight to 17 kg, now not recognized, the film was very much liked by the audience
 salmaan kii filmon kaa ye itihaas bhiraha he ki is actor kii baaki drama filmon kii bajaay ection filmein hameshaa darshakon kii pehali pasand rahi hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why Salman, who failed to entertain the audience in the role of a naive spear in Tubelight, has decided to return to action avatar once again
 tiger jinda he main salmaan ection image main kya-kya karname karte najar aaenge iskaa andaja film ke trailor main hi ho jayega
 After the poster, the trailer of Tiger Zinda Hai will now be awaited

 ratlam main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) se jude himmat patidaar par jis madan malviya naam ke shaks kii hatya kaa aarope he jab ajtak kii team ratlam jile ke us camed gaanv pahunchi to is hatya se jude kai chaunkaane vaali baaten saamne ai hai
 The most shocking thing is that this murder plot was done by Himmat long ago for which he was looking for a victim
 madan malviya shuru se himmat ke nishane par nahin tha balki wo achaanak hue ek ghatnakram ke chalate maaraa gaya
 In fact, Madan Malaviya was accused of killing Himmat Patidar, who was associated with the RSS till a few days ago, but when Ratlam Police took the case, the whole case was reversed because the Madan Malviya who was accused of killing Himmat Patidar himself
 He was found dead and the courage of the Patidar who had created a political storm in Madhya Pradesh itself turned out to be the creator and killer of the entire conspiracy
 jis madan ko police hatyara maan kar gharavaalon se poochtacha kar rahi thi, maamle kaa khulaasa hone ke baad ab matam pasra hua he
 Madan's parents, wife, are in a weeping state
 vidmbana dekhie ki madan kii patni naa to bol sakati he or na hi sun sakati he, lekin use is baat kaa ahsaas he ki uskaa pati ab is duniya main nahin he
 The father is now demanding the death penalty for his son's killer, citing Madan's two younger daughters
 pehle se tay thi hatyakand kii scryptis behad samvedansheel hatyakand kaa khulaasa hone ke baad dhire-dhire maamle kii kai paraten khul rahi hai
 When Aaj Tak's team went to the village of Kamed and talked to the people, it came to know that Himmat Patidar had already decided the story and script of the murder
 camed gaanv main hamen ramgopal naam kaa aisa shaks mila jo himmat patidaar kii sajeesh kaa shikaar hone se bal-bal batch gaya
 According to Ram Gopal, the accused Himmat had called Ramgopal on the farm at about one and a half the night of the incident, but due to the cold he refused to make excuses and perhaps this excuse saved his life
 ramgopal ne bataaya ki himmat patidaar ne ghatana vaali raat kol kiya tha or khet par party main bulaane kii koshish kii lekin raat zyada hone ke kaaran vahaan jane se manaa kar diya
 The police recounted the incident while we were talking to the people in the village that we received information about the police going to the scene
 ham vahaan pahunche to paaya ki jile ke espi gaurav tiwari sthaneey thane ke bal or ennesail team ke saath ghatana kaa ricriation kar rahe hai
 This is also important because now the police have started gathering strong evidence against him through him
 espi ne bataaya ki is hatyakand main mritak ke nakhunon or baalo ke sample ne jaanch kii disha badal di or jisaki hatya kaa maamla banaaya tha ab use hi hatya kaa aaropee banaaya gaya he
 SP Gaurav Tiwari said that the police initially suspected that an attempt to hide the body's identity was pointing to the conspiracy and hence the FSL team had taken samples of the body's nails and hair
 shuruyaat main shav ke himmat patidaar kaa hone kii baat saamne ai or us vakt halaat aise the ki sab vilaap kar rahe the jiske baad uskaa gharavaalon ne antim sanskaar kar diya tha, lekin mauka-e-vaardaat par mili saakshyon ke aadhaar par or eseruel team kii jaanch main shuruaati taur par ye baat saamne ai ki madan isamen kaatil he
 When he checked the phone found with the deceased, he found that he had been formatted and all the data was missing from it, while the details of the phone of Himmat Patidar were removed and it was found that he was using the net for a long time at night
 iske alaava khet main himmat aayaa to tha, lekin naa to usne motor chaalu kii or naa hi khet main pani daalaa
 Apart from this, the clothes that were on the body also looked like someone had worn them in a hurry
 iske alaava shav kaa sirf cheharaa jalaayaa gaya tha jiskaa sanket tha ki pahchaan chhipaane kii koshish kii gai he
 Disclosure from nails and hair, the FSL team had already revealed a sample of the dead body, hair and bone marrow, and sent it to Sagar, after which it came to know that the body was from Madan Malviya
 
 iske alaava jaanch main saamne aayaa ki himmat patidaar ne pichley disambar main hi 20 lakh kaa beemaa karavaaya he or uski 1 hazaar rupee kii kisht bhi jamaa kar di he or iske baad kuch logon ne bayaan bhi die kii ghatana vaali raat unhone himmat ko khet par dekha tha jabaki wo kareeb 1 hafte se khet par nahin gaya tha or sabhi jaruri saakshyon kaa milan kiya gaya to saaf ho gaya ki kaatil himmat patidaar he
 a reward of 10 thousand rupees has also been announced on accused Himmat Patidar
 aaropee ke ghar pahunchi puliceudhar, himmat patidaar ne hi hatya kii he, iskaa khulaasa hone ke agle din police ek baar phir aaropee ke kilanuma ghar pahunchi or parijanon se poochtacha kii
 He lives with his brothers in the Kilenuma house of Kamade village Himmat Patidar
 philhal himmat faraar he
 The police has also imposed a section under the SCST Act in the case as well as a conspiracy section because the way the murder was carried out, it seems that he had been plotting this murder for a long time
 vahiin is maamle kaa khulaasa hone ke baad bijepi bhi baikfoot par he kyonki hatyakand ke baad purv siem shivaraj ne congress par raajnneetik hatyaon kaa aarope lagaaya tha or andolan kii chetavanee bhi di thi
