 Among the ideas that the two have talked about, the role of Devi Lal Singh (devil) played by Salman in the movie Kick is playing in his mind
 film main salmaan ke kairactor ko khaaki vardi main dikhaaya gaya tha
 If this idea goes according to plan, then Salman can be seen in Rohit's film as a policeman

 These were later abandoned
 police ke kalakaaron ke taiyaar kiye ye sketch itane aspasht the ki unase koi madad milanaa mushkil hi tha
 When the real characters of the explosion were captured, their appearance did not get anywhere from the sketch
 mumbai main 11 june ko varisht patrkaar jyortimay de kii hatya ke silsile main giraftaar satish kaaliya kii shakl bhi police ke kalakaaron ke taiyaar kiye sketch se bilkul hi nahin milti thi
 This is because the police have the same artist making the sketch - 26-year-old Naresh Korde, who has sketched off criminals involved in numerous bomb blasts in Mumbai, Pune, Gorakhpur, Hyderabad and Varanasi as well as countless cases of rape and murder
 Are prepared
 harek aparaadh ke baad sandigdh logon ke sketch bananaa or unhen jari karnaa ab ek aupchaarikta ban gaya he
 Police expect people to find people similar to the sketch, but the story of the success of these crime-related sketches is not encouraging
 jaanch agenciyaan in scachon ko jaanch prakriya main mahatvapurn maanati hai, haalanki inhen sweekaar karne laayak saboot nahin mana jaataa
 Korde made his first sketch for the Ghatkopar police in 1999 when he was just 14 years old
 unhone ek mare hue shaks kaa bilkul pehle jaisaa cheharaa bana diya tha jisaki bahut zyada pitayee hone ke kaaran uski pahchaan karnaa mushkil tha
 He was thrown into a gutter
 is shaks ke sketch se uski pahchaan karne main police safal ho saki or jaanch shuru ho saki
 Since then Korde is the only artist to make sketches that the Mumbai Police relies on
 agar corde uplabdh nahin hote to mumbai police dilli se sketch banane vaale kalakaar ko bulaati he
 Korde now draws sketches with the help of his own computer software
 mumbai police ke ek varisht adhikari kaa kahana he ki huliye ke aadhaar par sketch taiyaar karne ke liye unke paas technology nahin he
 Korde has turned down police offers to buy his software
 unka kahana he, ''agar main ise bechata hum or duusare logon ko iskaa istemaal sikhaata hum to main berozegaar ho jaaoongaa
 "the exact sketch being released to the public depends on how carefully the eyewitnesses have seen the culprit, and to what extent do they remember his appearance, and how do they see the artist as his person
" telling
 apradhi ke byore main uski naak, uskaa hair style, ankhen, bhauhen, thudi, gaal, kad-lathi, lambaai tathaa duusari baaten shaamil hai
 "I have to sit for more than six hours to listen to various witnesses before preparing the final sketch," says Korde
 agar is prakriya main koi galati ho jaati he to sketch sahi nahin banataa

 His nephew Raj Thackeray received a message minutes after the demise of Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray after suffering a heart attack at 'matoshree' at 33 pm
 ise thakare ke kareebi rahe ravi dodha ne bheja tha
 According to the message, Thackeray's son Uddhav had decided that no one other than the family would be allowed to enter Thackeray's room on the second floor
 sandesh milane par raaj ne aagantukon ko samajhaayaa ki parivaar ne agle din ek bade antyeshti samaaroh kii yojana banaai he, isliye ve divangat netaa ko aakhri shradhanjali dene ke liye kamare main na jaaen
 After this, 7 in the evening
 30 baje raaj ghante bhar ke liye matoshri se baahar gaye
 On returning, he noticed that there was a small crowd of neighbors on Matoshree
 yah dekhakar ve bhanna uthe kyonki unase kuch or kaha gaya tha or yahaan kuch or ho rahaa tha
 Who was playing this game? The raging Shiv Sena leader shouted at Diwakar Raut, "mala khote ki hoga?" (are you trying to prove me a liar?) The case was actually something else
 thakare ke jo padosi matoshri par ikatthe hue the, ve unke kamare main jane kii ijaajat maang rahe the
 Uddhav did not prevent her from coming to Matoshree, just a ban on entering Thackeray's room
 raaj ko nahin pataa tha ki uddhav ne padosiyon se kya baat kii he, isliye ve shivasena ke netaaon par baras pade the
 No better example of this communication gap can be found
 thakare bandhuon ke bich galatfahami or avishvaas lambey samay se barkaraar he jo unhen alag kiye hue he
 Seven years later, Shiv Sena supporters and Raj-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) activists now want to see both cousins working together
 lekin hawaaon main galatfahami or sasti bayaanbajiyon kaa jehar ghulaa he
 The cracks between the two are in front of everyone
 agle din 18 november ko raaj ne bal thakare kii arthi ko kandhaa nahin diya
 Speculation is rife that Raj was asked to walk on the last journey instead of walking on the truck carrying Thackeray's body while Uddhav was on the truck
 sharmindagi ke ehsaas se raaj ne antim yatra bich main hi chhod di or trek ke shavadah grih pahunchane se kuch minute pehle ve sidhe shivaji park pahunche
 He told his colleagues, "I was having a headache
 ” magar hakeekat kya thi, iskaa khulaasa mumbai police kii aparaadh shakha ke ek afasar ke bayaan se hota he, jisane bataaya ki police ne raaj ko antim yatra main hissaa lene se manaa kar diya tha
 Raj had split from Shiv Sena in 2005
 agar ve trek main thakare ke shav ke saath hote, to mumkin tha ki thakare kii antim jhalak dekhne ko baichaiyn or uttejit 30 lakh shivasena samarthak hangaamaa kar dete
 a question often asked, which Bal Thackeray's death has once again brought alive: will 52-year-old Uddhav and 44-year-old Raj Thackeray be together again? Supporters of the Shiv Sena and members of the MNS believe that they must come together for broader interests: broader interests, the congress-ncp nexus being thrown out of power
 yah baat alag he ki donon bhaaiyon ko isaki koi jaldi nahin he
 In the last days of Thackeray, Raj used to visit Matoshree every next day, though during that time he did not talk to Uddhav and his family
 ve yaa to biimaar thakare kii bagal main baith jate the yaa phir matoshri ke peeche khadi apni marcides i class gaadi main paae jate
 His close aides say Uddhav's family did not treat him well
 samarthak bataate hai ki jab ve matoshri jate the to unhen ek cap chaay ke liye bhi nahin poocha jaataa tha
 But a supporter of Uddhav dismisses these allegations outright
 ve kehete hai, ''uddhav ne bal thakare ko mukhaagni dene se pehle raaj kaa haath pakadaa or unhen chita ke paas le gaye
 If there was any wrong feeling in his mind, he would keep Raj away from the last action
 ” emenes ke vidhayak nitin saradesai ke mutabik, unhen is baat kaa koi andaja nahin he ki donon bhaaiyon ke bich kya chal rahaa tha
 He says, "I went to Raj Matoshree with Raj for the last four days
 ve donon jab bhi balasaheb kii bagal main baithte the, main vahaan nahin hota
 “the bottom line of Shiv Sena supporters is not ready to accept Raj
 in logon kaa maananaa he ki 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle raaj ne bal thakare kii bhaavnaatmak apil kii upeksha kar di thi
 Thackeray said at the time, "my doors are always open
" faisla raaj kaa he
 Jitendra Janawale, Shiv Sena's deputy zonal chief from Andheri, says, "even if we came to power after getting one, Saheb would no longer be among us to take pleasure in it
" raaj unke jite ji to unhen khush nahin kar sake
 We can never accept them
 ”raaj ko jab bhi thakare kii anukriti bataaya jaataa he, to jitendra ko is baat se bahut chidh hoti he, ''sahib to asli sholay the (1975 kii hit film), raaj to ramgarh ke sholay hai (1991 main bani uski nakal)
 "an MNS leader from Andheri believes that there are great practical problems in joining hands with the Shiv Sena
 unke shabdon main, ''donon partiyon kaa apana santhnik dhaancha he
 The merger of the two will do nothing but create chaos
 ” shivasena ke maharashtra main kareeb 10 lakh sadsy hai jabaki emenes ke teen lakh
 Sardesai denies any scope of relationship restoration
 ve kehete hai, ''is maamle main raaj or uddhav hi koi faisla le sakate hai
 "he explains this politics with easy figures: MNS is on the rise as it won 13 seats in the last assembly election while its nine candidates had more than 1 lakh votes in the 2009 Lok Sabha election
 haalanki unamem se koi jeet nahin sakaa
 MNS has a large presence in the metropolises of Mumbai and Pune
 nasik main to yah satta main hi he
 Sardesai says, "we are in no hurry
" ” shivasena ke varisht netaa manohar joshi kehete hai, ''raajnneeti main kattar dushman bhi saath aa jate hai, lekin main sirf itnaa kah saktaa hum ki nikat bhavishya main raaj or uddhav saath nahin aaenge
 "whatever the political compulsions, family issues are different
 thakare parivaar ko jaanane vaale ek kareebi bataate hai, ''donon bhaaiyon kii patniyaan unhen saath nahin aane dengi
 "according to one source, both Uddhav's ambitious wife Rashmi and a shy but domineering wife Sharmila would like her husband to forge his own political path
 uddhav ke samarthak yaad karte hai ki kaise ek baar raaj ke ghar par unki patni sharmila ne unhen baar-baar matoshri jane par dapta tha
 An hour before his death, Bal Thackeray wanted to see Uddhav's younger son Tejas (18)
 tejas jab kamare main gaya, to thakare ne uskaa haath pakad kar uski peeth thoki
 He was unable to speak, but was he trying to give a message by patting his back? Significantly, on October 18, Uddhav announced his elder son Aditya (23) as the head of Yuva Sena, a youth wing of the Shiv Sena, at a rally at Shivaji Park
 bal thakare kaa janaa uddhav ke netritv kii agnipariksha he

 There is no doubt that the army will lack Thackeray's miraculous politics

 Worse, his relationship with BJP president Nitin Gadkari, who has been consistently supporting the Shiv Sena since 1986, is not very good

 Keep in mind that in an interview during the 2009 assembly elections, Raj had named Gadkari as a qualified candidate for the post of Chief Minister of Maharashtra

 Whatever has happened to Jadhav's mother-wife, that insult is the whole country

 Shilpa Shindane also accused the producers that without her knowledge the producers started auditioning for the role and she was shown the exit as soon as her actress was final

 Shilpa said, the producer made a small talk
 pehle mujhe ghar par bitha diya or ab agar vah chahenge bhi ki main is sho kaa hissaa banuun, to yah kabhi nahin hoga
 When Shilpa was asked that the producers have suffered a huge loss due to being out of your show, CINTAA has asked you to make up for it
 So this philosopher said, 'is there only loss of producers, Artist is not hurt? For so long, when i am sitting at home without any work and i am only answering without a legal notice, am i not at a loss? Due to this case, i could not even sign Shoko of Kapil
 lekin mujhe kaam kii kami nahin rahi or naa hi mujhe koi kaam karne se roak saktaa he

 shilpa scindia ne yah bhi kaha ki CINTAA ne haalanki un par koi bain nahin lagaaya he
 Rather, the word Bain was also not used in the notice issued by him
 lekin unako tarkeeb se said par kiya gaya he
 The letter from CINTAA reads, 'I cannot work until i pay Rs 10 to 15 crores as compensation for the loss
 ' This time, Owaisi's party AIMIM won the Lok Sabha elections and after the bjp-shiv Sena in Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, Owaisi did not have an agreement with Ambedkar's party in the number two AIMIM assembly elections in Aurangabad city where the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb died
 jahaan aaj bhi khadaa he garibon kaa taj mahal jo aurangzeb ke bete ne apni maa kii yaad main banwaaya tha
 It is called Bibi Ka Maqbara
 aurangabad, jo pehle hyderabad kaa hissaa tha, lekin rajakaron se aazaadee ke baad wo maharashtra ke hisse main aayaa
 In Aurangabad, it is still celebrated as Independence Day
 aazaadee ke jashn main shaamil nahin hue saansad jaleelamaharashtra chunaavon main meri kawarej isi aazaadee diwas ke jashn paar hangaame ke saath shuru hui
 Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jalil who is an AIMIM MP did not attend the celebrations
 haalanki unhone is par saaf kiya ki wo aurangabad se baahar the, lekin ise yahaan mudda banaaya ja rahaa he
 How did Aurangabad become a successful laboratory in the politics of Asaduddin Owaisi, this time will the bjp-shiv Sena alliance be able to dominate? My Ground Report

 com / lh0guo8f9g — Anjana Om Kashyap (@anjanaomkashyap) October 9, 2019 Now let's look at the political dominance that is clearly visible in Aurangabad right now
 dekhte hai aurangabad kaise bana asaddudin ovaisi kii raajnneeti main safal prayogshaala
 AIMIM had won the Lok Sabha Lok Sabha elections in 2019, Imtiaz Jalil of AIMIM had made a dent in the Shiv Sena stronghold
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jahaan prachand modi lahar ne sabakaa safaya kar diya, vahiin maharashtra main ovaisi kaise sansad main 1 se 2 ho gaye isi aurangabad kii badaulat
 AIMIM has been entering the politics of Maharashtra continuously for the last five years
 party ke do saansadon ke alaava maharashtra vidhansabha main teen vidhayak or aurangabad nagar nigam main bhi dhamak he
 In Aurangabad Municipal Corporation with the number two AIMIM113 seats in the Municipal Corporation, the bjp-shiv Sena retained its hold, but AIMIM stood second
 AIMIM ne 54 ummidavaar khadey kiye the jisamen use 26 main jeet mili
 The Congress was reduced to 10 and NCP 3
 aurangabad ambedkar ke dalit andolanon kii bhi jameen rahi he
 Imtiaz won the Lok Sabha election with only 4000 votes
 to ek badi vajah rahi pichley chunaav main bijepi shivasena kaa gathbandhan nahin ho paanaa
 In Aurangabad, it was Owaisi's biggest success to form a Muslim Dalit alliance and achieve this vote equation
 is baar nahin ho sakaa qaraar2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik ab aurangabad main 30
 Muslim population is 79 percent
 maujuuda anumaan ke mutabik ab yahaan par lagbhag 35 fisadi muslim aabaadi he, lekin isvidhansabha chunaav main ovaisiki ek chunauti ye bhi he ki hajaar koshishon ke baavjood prakaash ambedkar kii ore vanchit aagaadee party se unka gathbandhan nahin ho paaya
 Owaisi also knows that the constantly weakening Congress party is creating a unique political opportunity for him
 congress, kai anya jagahon kii tarah yahaan bhi lagbhag naa ke baraabar he
 The famous song from a Bollywood film is 'dushman Na Kare Dost'
 ' maharashtra or haryana ke chunavi ghamaasan ke bich congress main machi aapasi kalah par ye bilkul feet baithta he
 In two consecutive Lok Sabha elections, where the badly beaten Congress needs to unite to fight the BJP, the leaders of the party are chanting their voice
 congress main kyon jari he sangharsh?congress ke netaaon main taaja sir phutowwal rahul gandhi ko lekar shuru ho gai he
 Alam is that the Congress leaders are openly saying that the house is on fire with the lamp of the house
 maharashtra main jahaan paanch saal pehle tak congress kii tuuti bol rahi thi, jahaan 15 saal tak congress rajya kii satta par kabiz rahi, lekin 2019 kii chunavi ladaai main congress bijepi-shivasena kii ajey dikhne vaali gathjod ko chunauti de paane kii sthiti main nahin dikh rahi 
 Despite the weaknesses of the Congress, this time the challenge of Asaduddin Owaisi's party is in the Maharashtra assembly elections
 iske kai kaaran hai
 First, there was no alliance with Prakash Ambedkar's party
 ye ek aisi kamjor kadi ban sakati he jisaki vajah se ovaisi ke muslim dalit sameekaran ke sapane ko adhuraa hi rahanaa padegaa
 On the other hand, the alliance of BJP and Shiv Sena will ensure that the traditional vote banks of these two parties remain connected and there is no division of votes

 rahul gandhi dwaara narendra modi kii tulana hitler se kiye jane par kadi pratikriya karte hue bhaajapa ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki aaazaad bharat main agar kisi ne hitler se prerana lee he to vah congress upaadhyaksh kii daadi indira gandhi hai, jinhone desh main apatkaal lagaaya
 Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley said, 'every step of Indira ji during the Emergency was inspired by Hitler's rule
 donon main bas ek mul bhed he
 Hitler did not promote dynasty because he had no one to do so
 ' He said, he heard Rahul Gandhi's speech in Gujarat in which he compared Modi to Hitler
 unhone kaha 1975 main jab apatkaal laga to rahul ekadam yuva rahe honge
 But he will not be unaware of what happened in those 19 months
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, 'hitler or indira gandhi ke bich samanta chaunkaane vaali he
 Jaitley said that Hitler, when he came to power in 1933, imposed an emergency in Germany by saying that the Communists were setting fire to government buildings which later investigations proved to be wrong
 unhone kaha ki indira gandhi ne bhi 26 june 1975 ko yah kah kar desh main apatkaal lagaaya ki jepi andolan main sashastr balon se kaha ja rahaa he ki ve sarkaar ke avaidh adeshon kaa paalan nahin karen
 He said that Indira Gandhi, while announcing the 20-point economic program, claimed that an emergency was imposed to speed up discipline and development in the country
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki hitler ne bhi 25 sutri aarthik kaarykram kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Jaitley said Hitler did not have a two-thirds majority in Germany's parliament
 aise main vipaksh kii shakti kam karne ke liye usne vipaksh ke 91 saansadon ko giraftaar karvaa liya or samvidhan main sanshodhan karke purna shakti hathiyaa lee
 He said, Indira Gandhi also arrested a large number of opposition mps and brought the 42nd black amendment to the constitution
 yahi nahin unhone ek kadam aage jate hue sansad kii kaarywahi ke prakaashan par bhi pratibandh laga diya
 The BJP leader said that both Hitler and Indira Gandhi imposed emergency on their own and imposed censorship on the press and also suspended fundamental rights like life and liberty
 unhone kaha indira gandhi ke atarni general ne ucchtam nyaayalay main tark diya ki jivan tathaa swatantraaa ke adhikaar ke abhaav main ek kaidi kii jail main hatya kii ja sakati he
 "and the submissive Supreme Court of that time accepted this argument
 ’’ Just before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the phase of political agitation has started
 bhartiya janata party ke saansadavarun gandhi (varun Gandhi) ke congress main shaamil hone kii atakalon parcongress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii koi jaankaree nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi said in Bhubaneswar on Friday that i have no information about the news of speculation about Varun Gandhi joining Congress
 bataa den ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa yah bayaan aise vakt main aayaa he jab do din pehle unki bahan priyanka gandhi aupchaarik rup se sakriy raajnneeti main ai hai or unhen loksabhaa chunaav se pehle upi main ahm jimmedaari di gai he
 After Priyanka Gandhi's entry into politics, speculation of her cousin Varun Gandhi joining the Congress is also strong
 darasal, bhubaneshwar main ek kaarykram ke dauraan ek sawaal ki kya varun gandhi congress main shaamil ho rahe hai, iske jawaab main rahul gandhi ne kaha ki 'maine ye atakalein nahin suni hai'
 Explain that Varun Gandhi is a cousin of Rahul Gandhi who is an MP from the Bharatiya Janata Party
 varun gandhi uttar pradesh ke sultanpur kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Varun Gandhi's mother is Union Minister Maneka Gandhi who is the Minister of Women and Child Development in the Modi government
 gauratlab he ki varun gandhi ko lekar afvaahon kaa bazaar isliye bhi garm he kyonki do din pehle hi gandhi parivaar se ek or shaks yani priyanka gandhi kaa sakriy raajnneeti main padaarpan hua he
 At the same time, Varun Gandhi has been very isolated in the BJP for some time
 aisi khabaren hai ki varun gandhi ko bijepi main tarjeeh nahin di ja rahi he
 Its hallmark was also seen in the assembly elections last year as they did not hold rallies for the BJP

 Due to this, the team of FSL has sampled his voice on Thursday
 vidhayak anant singh par iljaam he ki unhone bholaa singh or mukesh singh kii hatya ke liye supaari di thi
 Which was mentioned in a phone call
 or uskaa audio viral ho gaya tha
 Now the FSL team will match a sample of Anant Singh's voice with the audio that went viral
 jisaki report agle hafte aa jaaegi
 However Anant Singh alleges that the state government is plotting against him
 unhone iske liye jadyu saansad lalan singh or rajya ke mantri niraj par sajeesh kaa aarope lagaaya he
 One of the mlas accused of conspiring to kill Mukesh and Bhola Singh, Bhola Singh himself is being described as a criminal
 anant singh khud ko nirdosh bataa rahe hai
 Who is Anant Singh: Earlier Anant Singh was part of JDU, the ruling party of Bihar, but these days he is an Independent MLA from Mokama
 dabang vidhayak anant singh or vivaadon kaa purana naata he
 There is hardly any section left in the book of law under which a case is not registered in the name of Anant Singh
 anant singh par dhai darjan se adhik sangeen maamle darj hai
 These include various serious cases like murder, kidnapping, extortion, robbery and rape
 akele sirf bihar ke baadh thane main hi kul 23 sangeen maamle darj hai
 It is a matter of fact that Anant Singh has been acquitted in many of these cases with his influence
 logon ke bich 'chote sarkaar' ke naam se charchit anant singh kaa naam kai maamalon main aayaa
 Due to which he had to go to Beur Jail in Patna also
 marcides se lekar buggy tak kii sawari karne vaale anant ko hatya or apharan ke maamle main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 The case was about the kidnapping of four youths and the murder of one of them
 4 saal pehle patna ke baadh main chaar yuvakon ne ek mahila se chhedchhad kar di
 It is alleged that at the behest of Anant, his operatives abducted the four youths
 unamem se ek yuvak kii dardanaak tareeke se hatya kar di gai thi
 The next day his body was found lying in a forest
 is maamle main police ne kai aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 The remaining three kidnapped youths were also recovered
 poochtacha ke dauraan aropiyon ne khulaasa kiya ki vidhayak ne chaaron yuvakon ko sabak sikhaane kaa aadesh diya tha, lekin ve baaki yuvakon ko maarthe isse pehle hi police vahaan pahunch gai thi
 Bollywood film 'bombay Talkies' has been selected for a special exhibition at the 66th 'cannes International Film Festival' and filmmaker Karan Johar is very happy with it

 asia cap ke apane pehle match main bangladesh ke khilaaf shandaar jeet hasil karne vaali team india ke saamne shuukravaar ko srilanka majboot chunauti pesh karegi
 India's eyes will have to maintain this rhythm
 bharat ne bhale hi bangladesh par chah wicket se jeet darj kii lekin unki asli pariksha srilanka ke khilaaf hogi jinhone gat champion pakistan ko 12 ran se parajeet kiya
 After a disappointing defeat in the series against South Africa and New Zealand, the Indian team returned to familiar subcontinent conditions and registered a first win in nine odis, setting a target of 280 runs
 kaaryvahak captain viraat kohli ne 136 ran kii pari khelkar anjiky rahane (73) ke saath 213 ran kii mahatvapurn saajhedaari kii jisase bharat ne asia cap abhiyaan main behtareen shuruuaat kii
 Kohli's superb form in Bangladesh will surely make India a strong contender to win the tournament, no matter how much disappointment he has faced overseas
 kohli ne yahaan 124 ke shandaar ausat se 10 maichon main 868 ran banaaye hai, jisamen unki pichley asia cap kii kariyar kii sarvshereshth 183 ran kii pari bhi shaamil he
 Talented middle-order batsman Rahane also left behind a mere 51-run failure in New Zealand in five odis, making the Indian middle-order look balanced before two crucial matches against Sri Lanka and Pakistan
 bhartiya team kaa final main pahunchnaa, inhen do ahm muqablon ke nateezon par nirbhar hoga to kohli ke khilaadiyon ke paas aaraam karne kaa mauka nahin hoga
 The Sri Lankan team has an aggressive bowler like Lasith Malinga who took five wickets against Pakistan
 bharat ke salaami ballebaaj rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan kii jodi bangladesh ke khilaaf kuch dhamal nahin kar saki lekin ve ab kuch ran jutakar apni team ko majboot shuruyaat karana chahenge
 Dhawan's weakness is short pitch balls and his disappointing batting has started troubling the Indian think tank as the left-handed batsman is passing time to prove himself
 dhawan ko rahane se prerana leni chahie jinhone vanade praaroop main kharaab form ke baad vaapasi kii
 Against Bangladesh, India did not make any changes in the playing XI against New Zealand, replacing wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik in place of injured Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Cheteshwar Pujara has been dropped
 ambati raidu ko pujaara kii jagah chunaa gaya
 But in the crucial match against Sri Lanka, it will be interesting to see if captain Kohli will gamble to include Pujara in the last XI or it will stay on this final XI
 gendbaaji main varun aron ne sabase zyada niraash kiya kyonki unki teji ne bangladeshi ballebaaj mushfiqur rahim or anamul haq kii jodi ko kabhi bhi pareshaan nahin kiya, in donon ne shatkeey saajhedaari nibhaa lee
 It may be risky to uphold the decision to include Aaron in the playing XI against Sri Lanka as the opposition team has in-form players like Kumar Sangakkara and opener Lahiru Thirimane
 desh kii sarkari vimaanan company air india kii bikri ko lekar nae sire se prastaav taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The new proposal being prepared by the Finance Ministry is also likely to include issues such as crude oil prices and exchange rate fluctuations
 salaahkaar company ne bataai thi ye vajahasalaahkaar company ivai ne pichley saal inhen sambhavit kaarnon main gina tha, jisaki vajah se air india ko koi kharidaar nahin mila tha
 In fact, the government had last year invited bids for 76 per cent stake and management control of Air India, but no one had bid
 iske baad vilay or adhigrahan ko lekar paraamarsh dene vaali company ivai ne ek report taiyaar kii thi, jisamen bikri prakriya ke vifal rahane ke kaarnon kaa ullekh kiya gaya tha
 These reasons included 24% stake of the government, excessive debt, crude oil prices and exchange rate fluctuations, changes in macro environment and other reasons
 philhal, vitt mantralay ke nae prastaav ko air india vishisht vaikalpik tantra (AISAM) ke paas bheja jayega
 AISAM is a group consisting of Ministers associated with the Ministry of Finance and Civil Aviation
 ivai kii report parakhaaishan ne kii thi charchanus agency pitiai ke mutabik ek adhikari ne bataaya ki ivai kii report par pichley saal june main AISAM kii baithak main charchaa hui thi
 After this the sale process of AI was deferred
 adhikari ne kaha, ‘ham air india kii bikri ko lekar ek nayaa prastaav AISAM ke samaksh rakhenge
 Issues raised after the disinvestment of Air India last year will also be covered
 AISAM ko yah tay karnaa hoga ki sarkaar 100 fisadi hissedari kii bikri karegi yaa 76 fisadi kii
 ' rus main gita ko ‘ugravadi sahitya’ bataa kar adaalat dwaara pratibandhit karaane kii muhim par loksabhaa main sabhi dalon ke sadasyon ne baari aakrosh jataate hue is sambandh main sarkaar se hastkshep kii maang kii
 Members of almost all parties, including bjp's Murali Manohar Joshi, rjd's Lalu Prasad Yadav, sp's Mulayam Singh Yadav, Congress's Ijya Raj Singh and Shiv Sena's Chandrakant Khare in Russia, raised this issue in zero time by Bhutuhari Mahtab of BJD in Russia
 Strictly objected to the campaign being run
 sadasyon dwaara rosh prakat kiye jane ke dauraan lalu prasad bich-bich main ‘bolo krishna bhagwaan kii jai’ kaa udghosh karte rahe or sadasyon ne bhi is udghosh main ek swar se unka saath diya
 Lalu termed the campaign against Gita in Russia as a "wicked conspiracy" and demanded immediate intervention from the government
 mehataab ne kaha ki rus ke siberia main tomsk kii adaalat main iskan ke sansthaapak e si bhakthivedaant swami prabhupad dwaara likhit ‘bhagavat gita yatharoop’ ke roosi anuwaad par pratibandh lagane ke liye june se hi maamla chal rahaa he or is maamle main adaalat dwaara somvaar ko faisla diya janaa he
 He said that there is talk of banning Gita with the allegation that it is 'extremist literature'
 mehataab ne kaha ki is bare main rus ke ek vishvavidhyalay ‘tomsk state uniwarsity’ ke ek visheshgy kii raay maangi gayi he jabaki is vishvavidhyalay main bharat sambandhi vishay padhaaye hi nahin jate hai
 Mahatab said that it has been argued in the court to ban the Gita, that its narrative is about to spread social disharmony
 unhone sarkaar se maang kii ki vah turant is maamle main hastkshep kare
 He also demanded the Indian Embassy in Moscow to be instructed to intervene in the matter
 bhaajapa ke murali manohar joshi ne ise ek gambhir maamla bataate hue kaha ki pradhanmantri ko apane str par rus ke shaskaon ke saath yah maamla uthaanaa chahie
 Members of other parties also appeared very angry on this matter

 Due to the recession, developers selling expensive homes had to adopt affordable housing but still do not consider buyers
 is bajet main real estate sector kii sarkaar se kai maange hai jisase ruthe hue kharidaaron ko bhi manaaya ja sake or apane liye bhi rasta aasaan ho
 Real estate demands that in this budget - rebate to be given as interest on home loans 1
 5 lakh rupee se badhaakar 3 lakh kiya jaye
 - Principal repair of home loan should be relaxed from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh
 -afordable houseing ko badhaava dene ke liye section 80 ai bi (10) ke antargat tex holiday-rihaishi sampatti ke kiraaye se hone vaali aay par 30 fisadi kii bajaay 10 fisadi tex ho
 In addition to this, interest rates will be kept low to enable more people to take home, due to the fact that at present there is a need of around 25 million houses in the country and public-private partnership can also be effective in reducing this gap, provided the real estate sector
 Should be provided with necessary facilities and they should be used properly
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne uparajyapal najeeb jang ko ek behad talkh chitthee likhakar unke saath-saath pradhanmantri narendra modi par bhi jamkar hamalaa bolaa he
 Arvind Kejriwal has written this letter on Thursday on the controversy over the post of the chairman of the Delhi Women's Commission
 isamen sabase pehle alji par hamalaa bolaa gaya he or kaha gaya he ki "alji sahab kaa kahana he ki vah khud hi dilli sarkaar hai
 
 
 How can this happen
 
 
 ? ek vyakti khud ko sarkaar kaise kah saktaa he
 
 
 The Then there will be dictatorship in Delhi
 
 
 isse zyaada haasyaaspad baat nahin ho sakati
 
 
 Delhi government means elected government, no person is special
 
 
 " At the same time, targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kejriwal has written that LG Sahab has disabled the Delhi Commission for Women at the behest of the PM, just as it had done to the ACB
 kejariwal ne kaha ki kanoon or samvidhan ke mutabik mahila ayog kaa maamla puri tarah alji ke adhikaar kshetra se baahar he, isliye is tarah mahila ayog kaa daftar band karakar jabardastee file mangavaana puri tarah asanvaidhanik or gaiyrkanoonee hi nahin, balki saraasar blackmel he
 The comments kejariwal ne likhaa ki alji kii is puri kavayad kaa ek hi makasad nazar aata he ki darasal pradhanmantri uparajyapal ke jariye dilli sarkaar ko jhukaana chaahate hai
 Finally Arvind Kejriwal wrote, "for us the issue of women's commission is not a battle of ego but a very important and sensitive issue, so LG saheb, PM won and we all lost
 
 
 aapke paas mahila ayog kii file bhej rahaa hum

 arvind kejariwal ne guuruuvaar ko hi yah khat dilli mahila ayog ke adhyaksh pad ko lekar hue vivaad par likhaa he
 In this, LG has been attacked first and it is said that "LG Sahab says that he himself is the Delhi Government

 The How can a person call himself a government
 
 
 ? phir to dilli main taanaashaahee ho jaaegi
 
 
 Nothing could be more ridiculous than this
 
 
 dilli sarkaar kaa matlab hota he, chuni hui sarkaar, koi vyakti vishesh nahin

 Kejriwal said that according to the law and the constitution, the matter of the Women's Commission is completely outside the jurisdiction of the LG, so forcing the women's commission to close the office and forcefully file it is not only unconstitutional and illegal, but sheer blackmail
 tippaniyan Kejriwal wrote that the whole motive of lg's entire exercise seems to be that the Prime Minister wants to bend the Delhi government through the Lieutenant Governor
 aakhir main arvind kejariwal ne likhaa, "hamaare liye mahila ayog kaa mudda aham kii ladaai nahin, balki behad mahatvapurn or samvedansheel mudda he, isliye alji sahab, piem jite or ham sab haar gaye

 desh main adivaasiyon kii haalat bahut kharaab he
 This thing has once again surfaced
 adivaasiyon kii badahaali par ek report sarkaar ke hi banaae panel ne jamaa kii, lekin endie sarkaar pichley chah maheene se is report ko apane paas rakhe hue hai or thos kadam uthaane ke bajaay chupchaap baithi hui he
 a high-level panel was formed in August last year (2013) under the chairmanship of noted sociologist Virginius Khakha, who said that tribal people are among the worst in the country in terms of education, health, and malnutrition
 bharat main adivaasiyon kii sankhya aath se nau fisad (kareeb 8
 6 percent), but they are suffering the most of the development projects
 khakh panel kii yah 400 pannon kii report enditivi india ke paas he jisamen kaha gaya he ki vikaas ke project kii vajah se visthapit hone vaale 40 se 60 fisad log adivasee hai jo baar baar apane gharon se bhagaae jate hai or unhen basaane kii koi sanjeeda yojana kabhi nahin banaai jaati
 Less than 20 percent of the displaced people were tried to settle and most of it is on paper only
 is report main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki sarkaar ne adivaasiyon kii zamin par prachur maatra main khanij hone kii vajah se kai project lagaae iske liye unki zamin ko pipipi model ke tahat nijee companiyon ko diya gaya
 In return, the tribals have got nothing
 khakh panel kii sadsy usha ramanathan ne enditivi india se baat karte hue kaha ki is report ko taiyaar karte hue unhen ehsaas hua ki sarkaar kii nitiyaan adivaasiyon ke rahan-sahan or unke parivesh ke hisaab se hai hi nahin
 Usha Ramanathan told NDTV India, 'today tribals are not only getting displaced from their homes again and again but they are also in jails without any solid reason

 tivenkal khanna bataur nirmaataa apni film pedman ke kaaran charchaa main hai
 Akshay Kumar is in the lead role in it
 haal hi main tvinkal ne bataaya ki kis tarah ve apane bete aarav se khulkar baat karti hai
 Twinkle Khanna told that once Aarav was writing play for a school project
 uske paas do idia the
 i told him, son please make airlift, not housefull
 iske baad usne kaaphi gambhirtha se likhaa
 Both were two way communication, as it should be
 mere bachche mujhase kah sakate hai ki ve hamaare bare main kaisaa mahasoos karte hai
 'let us tell you that Akshay Kumar has been seen in Housefull
 iskaa content kaaphi bold mana jaataa he
 Twinkle told- Reaction of son Aarav on his kissing scenetwinkle says that my children are very naughty
 ve meri filmon ke seens nikaalkar uskaa majaak banaate hai
 He repeatedly plays a scene in the film 'jaan' (1996), in which i kiss around a man's chest
 mere ek berthde par usne kolaj banaaya tha'pinkavila ko die ek intervyuu main bataaya tha, 'mujhe acha nahin lagata ki mere bachche meri filmein dekhen or meraa betaa to bahut shararti he
 He repeatedly plays the clip of my 1996 film Jaan where i am doing a kissing scene
 usne mere seen kaa itnaa majaak banaaya ki mere ek berthde par to us seen kaa baqayada kolaj banaaya tha
 When CM Vijay Rupani asked the film Padman with Akshay Kumar about a funny anecdote from the set of films, Twinkle said, 'I had a co-actor who canceled the shoot

 devendra satyartheeh ek safarnamaprakash manuprakashan vibhaag,bharat sarkaarkimtah 195 ru
 Writer Prakash Manu has felt the close life of Lokayatri Devendra Satyarthi by sitting near him
 satyaarthee se unki lagaataar mulakaaton ke baad taiyaar hui yah kitaab
 Here are some excerpts of the same: In these journeys again and again, hunger and hunger would arise
 kai baar kisi ped ke neeche yaa footpath par bhookha sona padataa
 They were not averse to working and labor in between
 un dinon gujaarey ke liye satyaarthee ji ne tatanagar main tin kii chaddaren uthaane se lekar akhbaar bechney, tution, hdhufaridag jaise kaam kiye
 Satyarth Prakash appeared in a press in Ajmer
 vahaan kaam karte hue unhone apana naam 'satyaarthee' rakhaa or paariwarik naam 'batta' se chuttee paa lee, jo unhen bachapan se hi apriy tha (pej 35-36)
 Hearing about Santiniketan and Gurudev from Satyarthi was a really enjoyable experience
 aise kshan jab ve puri tarah khud main dub jate or unke shabdon main gurudev or shantiniketan kaa bada hi chhabila chitra ubharta tha
 
 
 "I was Ramta Jogi, i had reached Santiniketan on my way
 '' satyaarthee ji ne muskaraate hue baat kaa sira pakadaa or phir sur main aakar bataane lage
 "in those days, the fame of Santiniketan had spread far and wide
 ek se ek badi pratibhaaen vahaan thim
 There was a desire to meet, talk to him, but above all, there was a desire to meet Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur
 tab tak gurudev se choti-moti mulaakaaten to hui thim lekin khulkar baat nahin hui thi
 It was famous about him that he never touched anyone's feet
 ek dfa maine dhokhe se unke pair chhu liye to unhone mujhe pyaar se aashirwad diya
 After that i discussed in detail my folklore collection and kept listening very carefully
 khush hokar bole ki maine bhi bachapan main baiylgaadee main baithkar puure desh kii yatra kerani chaahi thi or 'palli geet' ikatthe karne kii yojana banaai thi, par vah kaam adhuraa rah gaya
 i am glad that you are doing the work that i could not do
 '' rabindranath thakur ne hi unhen bataaya ki bengal main lokgeeton ko 'palli geet' kaha jaataa he
 
 
 Had to meet Gurudev in Shantiniketan, Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Avanindranath Thakur, Nandlal Basu, Ramkinkar and even more so many celebrities, they first got there first
 
 
 (pej 45-46)
 Satyarthi ji used to narrate an interesting episode related to Acharya (hazariprasad) Dwivedi
 
 
 satyaarthee ji shanti niketan main unase milane ke liye gaye
 There was some literature, some discussion and gossip
 dvivedi ji badi ruchi se satyaarthee ji se unki lambii or anwarat yatraaon ke bare main poochhate rahe
 Then suddenly he asked, "what are you writing nowadays?" At that time Satyarthi ji had a sketch in his hand, 'iravati'
 unhone vah dvivedi ji ko padhane ke liye diya
 Dwivedi kept that article
 do-ek din baad satyaarthee ji ko lautnaa tha
 
 
 Asked for the article back
 par dvivedi ji ne gambhir mukhmudra ke saath kaha, ''vah lekh to ab aapako na mil sakegaa
 "satyarthi ji chaunke," "why good?" On this he said, "he is printed in visva-bharati
" maine tabhi press main bhej diya tha
 If you stop tonight, then see its proof too
 '' (pej 51)
 The graph of Satyarthi's relationship with Agnay has been very complicated
 ek samay ve saath rahe, phir dooriyaan bhi ain
 Even if i got my mind, there was also a confrontation
 par sachai yah thi ki satyaarthee ji agyeya kaa kaaphi sammaan karte the or ve bhi unhen kaaphi aadar dete the (pej 99-100)
 If Satyarthi went on a trip to Pakistan, without telling the housemates, the months stayed there
 tab lokmata ko pan
 Nehru had to write a letter
 satyaarthee ji se is bare main poocha gaya
 
 
 They started saying, "nehru sent that letter to the Ambassador of India in Pakistan
 unhone jor lagaaya, pakistan ke lekhakon ne bhi samajhayaa, tab maine waapas dilli kaa tikat kataaya
 Satyarthi

 Indian security agencies have always claimed that underworld don Dawood Ibrahim is deeply involved in terror
 ab is hakeekat kii tasdik lashkar e taiyaba ke sargana hafiz said ke bete talha said kii jubaan se hui he
 Sensational video surfaced: a video of Tal Saeed has surfaced in which he is inciting the crowd to terrorism by taking the name of Dawood Ibrahim
 video 5 farvari ko shoot kiya gaya tha
 This day is celebrated as 'kashmir Day' in Pakistan
 video main talha samarthakon se poochta he ki kya wo doctor, police yaa jaj bananaa chaahate hai? bheed kaa jawaab 'naa' main aata he
 After this, Talha asks if people want to be like Dawood and Burhani Wani, then the crowd shouts and responds in a 'yes'
 kyon ahm he video?video ne bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ke kaan khadey kar diye hai kyonki ye pehla mauka he jab kisi pakistani aatanki sanghathan ne sidhe-sidhe daaud ibrahim kaa zikr kiya he
 Dawood is living in Karachi after the 1993 Mumbai blasts
 haalanki pakistani sarkaar is baat se inkaar karti ai he
 Dawood's involvement in fake currency, drugs and real estate business is well known
 bhartiya khufia agenciyaan maanati hai ki di-company ke paise kaa bada hissaa aatankwaad kii funding par kharch hota he
 This video can prove to be important evidence for India in clamping down on Dawood

 In the missing case of nurse Bhanwari Devi, her husband Amar Chand in Rajasthan on Wednesday tried to escape from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) questioning but was apprehended by the authorities
 sibiai ne amar chand ko buudhvaar ko poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa tha jisamen kuch kathin sawaalon ke vah jawaab nahin de paa rahaa tha jisaki vajah se usne bhaagane kii koshish kii lekin use pakad liya gaya
 Amar Chand, however, has not been arrested yet
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki usne poochtacha main kabhi sahyog nahin kiya
 It is noteworthy that Bhanwari Devi has been missing since September 1 in Bilada area of jodhpur
 uski gumshudagi main kathith bhoomika kaa aarope lagane ke baad mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne 16 oktober ko maderna ko cabinet se hataa diya tha
 It is said that in a CD, former minister Bhanwari Devi is in an objectionable state, on the basis of which Bhanwari was blackmailing her, due to which he made her disappear
 sibiai ke aaropapatr main daawa kiya gaya he ki 'bhavari devi ko sidi ke liye 50 lakh rupee dene kaa vaada kiya gaya tha or baad main use agava kar liya gaya'
 The CBI has stated in the charge sheet that it is suspected that Bhanwari was strangled to death
 haal hi main lambii khinchataan ke baad karnataka ke mukhyamantri kii kursi chhodane ko majaboor hue echdi kumaraswami kii party se hi ab virdohi dal bhartiya janata party ke samarthan kii aawaaj uthne lagi he
 The mlas of Kumaraswamy's party Janata Dal (secular) have demanded him to support the BJP government to keep the BJP government safe for the next three years
 vidhayakon ne purv mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami se kaha he ki samarthan sarkaar main shaamil hokar athwa baahar se samarthan dekar kiya ja saktaa he
 Kumaraswamy has asked for time to consider it
 vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki kumaraswami jo bhi nirnay lenge, vah unhen maanya hoga
 Significantly, the faction of mlas initially said that they can sit in opposition and would welcome good programs of BJP
 sabhi vidhayakon ne charchaa ke baad ant main kaha ki bhaajapa kaa samarthan karnaa or sarkaar ko bachaana behatar hoga
 Explain that after several days of drama in Karnataka, the government of JDS and Congress could not win the confidence in the Assembly
 congress ke 13 or jedies ke teen vidhayakon ne july maheene kii shuruyaat main vidhansabha kii sadsyta se istipha de diya tha
 This put the Kumaraswamy government in danger
 bhaajapa ne sarkaar ke alpamat main aa jane kaa daawa karte hue rajbhavan se lekar vidhansabha tak, aakraamak abhiyaan chalaaya
 The case of Assembly mlas not accepting the resignation of mlas also reached the Supreme Court and finally Kumaraswamy moved a motion of confidence in the Assembly
 vah vishwaas hasil karne main vifal rahe or unhen mukhyamantri pad se istipha dena padaa
 Kumaraswamy and the Congress had been accusing the BJP of blame for horse trading from the beginning and the BJP continued to deny them
 haalanki baad main yediurppa ne mumbai ke resort main tehre baagi vidhayakon ke sampark main hone kaa daawa kiya tha
 The government on Monday introduced a bill to amend the Right to Information (RTI) Act
 is sanshodhan ke jariye raajnneetik dal artiai adhinium ke daayre se baahar ho jaaenge
 Union Minister of State for Personnel and Training V
 narayansami ne loksabhaa main vidheyak pesh kiya
 The issue has been in the news ever since the Central Information Commission (CIC) ordered on June 3 that the six political parties be under the purview of the RTI Act, as they are public authorities, and receive substantial amounts of funds from the government
 tippaniyan The government will have no difficulty in passing this bill, as most of the parties are against this order of the CIC
 kendriya mantrimandal ne do agast ko hi sanshodhano ko manjuuri de di thi
 Defending the amendments, Union Law Minister Kapil Sibal had said at the time that no political party would be able to function if the CIC order was implemented
 yah mudda tab se surkhiyon main he, jab kendriya soochna ayog (siaisi) ne teen june ko aadesh diya ki chah raajnneetik dal artiai adhinium ke daayre main honge, kyonki ve saarvajanik praadhikaran hai, or sarkaar se paryaapt maatra main fund praapt karte hai
 The comments sarkaar ko is vidheyak ko paarit karaane main koi kathinaayee nahin hogi, kyonki adhikansh partiyaan siaisi ke is aadesh ke khilaaf hai
 The Union Cabinet approved the amendments on August 2 only
 sanshodhano kaa bachaav karte hue kendriya kanoon mantri kapil sibbal ne us samay kaha tha ki yadi siaisi ke aadesh kaa kriyanvayan hua to koi bhi raajnneetik dal kaam nahin kar paaegaa

 hamen bharat se itar madhya purv ke deshon main bhi apni filmon kaa pradarshan karne kii ore dhyaan dena chahie

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh strongly condemned the terrorist attacks in Mumbai and said that foreign forces are behind these attacks
 desh ke naam sambodhan dete hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki is karrwai main shahid hue hamaare bahadur sipaahiyon kii shahadat ko ham salaam karte hai
 The Prime Minister said that now there is a need to check the infiltration of suspects in the country
 gauratlab he ki buudhvaar ko mumbai ke kai ilkon main hui aatanki hamalon main 101 logon kii maut ho gai
 During this, ATS chief Hemant Karkare, IPS officer Ashok Kamte and ATS encounter chief Vijay Salaskar were martyred
 18 disambar 2013 ko lokapal paas hua tha
 23 November 2016 arrived
 lokapal nahin he
 From 2011 to 2013, the debate in Delhi-run media was not as much about any other issue as it was about Lokpal and corruption
 lokapal kii kshamta or bhrashtachar ke mit jane kii tamaam sambhaavnon par khub bahes hui
 For the first time, people started arguing about a law and its structure in this way
 thik usee tarah se jaise in dinon notebandi ko lekar ghar-ghar main bahes ho rahi he
 All happened, but the Lokpal did not come
 abhi tak wo lokapal nahin aayaa he, jise bhrashtachar ko jad se ukhaad kar phenkna tha, notebandi aa gai he, jiske bare main daawa he ki bhrashtachar dur karne kaa aitihaasik kadam he
 Historically, Lokpal was also called
 sadan main pesh kiye jane ke 46 saal baad lokapal kanoon paas hua tha
 History could not become the present of Lokpal
 sabak yahi he ki itihaas banane se vartmaan nahin banataa he
 Have they also forgotten those who fought the battle of Lokpal? notebandi ke hangaame main lokapal kaa zikr aayaa bhi to supreme court kii tippanee ke baad
 The Lokpal movement led to a party which has a government in Delhi
 is andolan se do log alag hue jinamein se ek centre main videsh rajya mantri hai
 One is the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry
 anna hazaare abhi tak naitik guru ke pad par bane hue hai
 From time to time, they appear on TV
 sansad main lokapal upie ke samay paas hua tha
 There is so much fighting over demonetisation? Have you heard any Congress leader doing 'lokpal Lokpal'
 lokapal ko paas karaane main bijepi kaa bhi haath tha or usne bhi khub shrey liya tha
 Who can forget the memorable speech of Sushma Swaraj as Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha
 is vakt sushamaa ji astpal main hai or ham bhi or aap darshakon kii taraf se bhi unke sheeghra swasth hone kii kaamana karte hai
 It is not that the current Prime Minister Modi did not welcome the Lokpal from Gujarat
 18 disambar ko hi unhone teen twit kiya tha
 At that time, 125 crores who spoke in support of Lokpal spoke on behalf of Indians
 is vakt bhi notebandi ke samarthak 'puraa desh puraa desh' bol rahe hai
 How did the country forget the time of Lokpal
 notebandi ke samay vaala desh kaise nahin bhuulenge, ham kaise daawa kar sakate hai
 The appointment of Lokpal is one aspect
 lokapal naam kii sanstha kaa dhaancha kya taiyaar kar liya gaya he
 Prashant Bhushan's team had filed a petition in the Supreme Court on which the court's comment came
 lokapal se lekar notebandi tak sapana ek hi he, bhrashtachar mitna chahie
 Even demonetisators can fight again for Lokpal
 supreme court ne bhi kaha he ki lokapal ko ek ded letters nahin banane diya janaa chahie
 The government will have to set a deadline for this
 7 disambar ko phir se sunwaayee hogi
 The Leader of the Opposition is not in the current Lok Sabha and it is necessary to have a Leader of the Opposition in the committee appointed for the Lokpal
 niyukti ke isi niyam main badlaav karnaa he
 There are reports of record working of post-2014 Parliament sessions
 kai saare bill ke paas hone kii khabaren aati hai
 a bill that seemed like an impossible GST passed
 lokapal kii niyukti main kiski dilchaspee nahin he
 When did it become an opinion that the Lokpal has no role in eradicating corruption
 lokapal andolan ne media ko bhi badla tha
 The TV channels which were engaged in Bhoot Phantom became the broadcasting center of the fight for corruption
 ankaron ke maseehaa banane kaa daur yaheen se shuru hota he
 Freedom Part Two was launched
 sabko lag rahaa tha ki ve desh kii aazaadee ke liye ji jaan se bahes main jute hai
 As it is now being told that the problem you are going through is for the country
 aam log tivi studio se lekar mike par aa gaye
 The media unleashed that hunger
 bhrashtachar mitaane ke kaaryakramon ko tiarapy milane lagi
 Lokpal was the turning point due to which the closed studio walls of the TV collapsed
 aam logon kii baat pahunchane lagi
 Passionate debate is going on even today, just need to remind someone that similar debate has been done earlier
 zyada nahin teen saal pehle
 Like this time, a lot of surveys were being done at that time
 news channel sienen, ibien or sienbisi tivi 18 ne siesds ke saath milakar ek akhil bhartiya survey kiya tha
 The 'hindu' newspaper was also published
 9 agast 2011 ke first post main is survey par report chhapi
 34 percent of the people surveyed said that the name of Lokpal was heard
 24 pratishat logon ne kaha tha ki unhen pataa he ki lokapal kya he
 Among educated people, 67 percent had heard about Lokpal and 51 percent said that they know what Lokpal is
 aise survey tamaam channelon or akhabaaron ne kiye honge, lekin us samay ke survey kaa sawaal thik lagata he ki jis lokapal ko lekar itnaa hangaamaa he zaraa poocha to jaae ki kitne logon ne naam suna he or kitne logon ko lokapal kaa matlab pataa he
 The questions in that survey were very nuanced
 lokapal par aapke kya mat hai? kya aap sarkaar ke tark se sahamat hai? kya aap anna hazaare ke tark se sahamat hai? It is being said that only the rich are corrupt, but the survey at that time asked about five categories of which are the most corrupt - government, elected representatives, judiciary, businessmen, industrialists, ngos and media
 survey main shaamil 32 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki sarkaar sabase bhrasht he or 43 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki chune hue netaa sabase bhrasht hai
 Similar surveys are also being conducted these days
 notebandi ke baad mukhya sawaal yahi ho gaya he ki aap sarkaar ke faisle se khush hai yaa nahin
 Survey questions are around this
 tab lokapal ko log bhrashtachar kaa muktidaata maan kar survey main shaamil ho rahe the, ab use bhul kar log notebandi ko nayaa muktidaata maanane lage hai
 Even then there were the same people, still the same people
 kya lokapal kii tarah kuch sawaal is tarah se puche ja sakate hai jaise -kya aap jaanate hai ki kaala dhan kaise kaise banataa he? Do you know what are the types of black money other than cash notes? kya aap jaanate hai ki farji company banaakar duusare deshon main paisa rakhaa jaataa he? Do you believe that black money will be eradicated only by demonetisation? lokapal ke samay yah poocha gaya ki aap iske bare main kitna jaanate hai
 At the time of demonetisation it should also be asked what you know about black money
 ab har koi yahi puch rahaa he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? kam se kam mukhya sawaal to yahi he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? bhrashtachar ke khilaaf karrwai kaa virodh wo bhi nahin karegaa jo bhrashtachar main shaamil he
 There are surveys of 'dainik Jagran' and 'hindustan'
 19 november ke 'dainik jaagran' ke survey kaa pehla sawaal he ki is kadam se hone vaali pareshaani ke baavjood aap iske paksh main hai? is survey main shaamil 86
 1 percent people said that yes
 kya bade note band karke sarkaar ne sahi kadam uthaaya he- 84
 8 percent of the people have said that they have taken the right steps
 chauthaa sawaal he ki kya isse kaala dhan samaapt ho jayega or aage iske raste band ho jaaenge
 In response to this, there is a huge change in the opinion of people
 25 pratishat log kehete hai ki sahamat nahin hai, 67
 2 percent say they agree
 jabaki sarkaar ke kadam ko acha maanane waalon kaa pratishat 84
 8 and 86
 1 pratishat he
 On 20 November, a survey is published in Hindi newspaper Dainik Hindustan
 jaagran ke survey main acha kadam bataane waalon kii pratishat 85 yaa usase adhik he
 The survey of Hindustan shows that the supporters of demonetisation decreased continuously in the last ten days
 8 november ko hi hindustan ke survey main 78 fisadi logon ne samarthan kiya tha
 Seven days later the number of supporters decreased to 61
 93 pratishat ho gai
 After 10 days, the number of supporters reduced to 46 percent
 times aaf india ne bhi 22 november ko si-voter kaa ek survey chapa he jiske anusaar 80 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki ve notebandi se hone vaali takalifon kii parvaah nahin karte
 The whole question is whether the supporters of the verdict or care about the suffering caused by it
 anna andolan ke dauraan hi arvind kejariwal ne lokapal se jude har pahalu par janamat sangrah kaa chalan shuru kiya tha
 In 2011, a survey was conducted in Old Delhi and Model Town regarding what the Lokpal should be like
 tab kaaphi mazaaq uda tha ki kanoon sansad ke vivek se banataa he yaa is tarah se missd kol vaale survey se
 These surveys have returned again in the era of demonetisation
 pradhanmantri ne ap jari kiya he jisapar kaale dhan ko lekar das sawaal puche gaye hai
 Such a big decision in Indian history
 usee tarah se lokapal ke bare main kaha jaataa tha or in survey par sawaal uthte the
 At that time Kejriwal used to survey and paste on Delhi's auto
 un survey kaa mazaaq udata tha, sawaal hote the
 Within Parliament, Sharad Yadav used to say that the law will be made at the discretion of the House
 tivi kii bahes or survey se nahin
 However, more than five lakh people have voted on the Prime Minister's app within 24 hours
 do sawaalon main to 98 or 99 pratishat samarthan main mat mili hai
 If you are potato farmer, poor people, laborer then you should also take part in the survey
 survey ke sawaal par bhi sawaal hua he, lekin pradhanmantri ne is aitihaasik bhagidaari ke liye sabakaa aabhaar jataayaa he
 Recall where all the tantrums, the bulls of the Lokpal era have become
 dost-dost aapas main ladane lage the
 New political loyalties were being formed
 kahin vahi sab to phir se nahin ho rahaa he
 Has debating between you and your group of friends not accelerated since demonetisation
 zarur hui hogi
 Recall what happened to the debates during Lokpal's time
 aam aadmi party ne centre ke lokapal ko sweekaar nahin kiya or apana janalokapal banane kaa elaan kar diya
 On 4 December 2015, the Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill was passed in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 isaki bhi aalochana hui
 It was said that when Chief Minister Kejriwal used to agitate, he used to say that if there will be more leaders in the appointment of Lokpal, then it cannot work honestly
 lekin jab dilli kaa janalokapal aayaa to usamen netaa hi zyaada the
 When it was criticized, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court was also included at the behest of Anna
 janalokapal bill paas hokar bhi lagu nahin hua he
 Nearly a year has passed for this too
 philhal dilli main lokayukta hai
 The comments donon daur ko yaad kiijie
 There was so much pride among the leaders
 bhrashtachar ko mitaane vaala lokapal aayaa bhi nahin
 But during this time many laws were made to fight corruption, SIT was made
 aghoshit sampatti ghoshit karne kii yojana ai
 Demonetisation came, but the post of Lokpal remained vacant
 notebandi se hone vaali pareshaaniyon or sarkaar kii lachar taiyaariyon ke khilaaf vipaksh ne 28 november ko deshvyapee aakrosh diwas kaa elaan kiya he
 At that time also, on 23 August 2011, on the call of Anna Hazare, 9 opposition parties of non-nda supported the nationwide movement
 lokapal nahin aayaa ye ek tathy he par aisa nahin he ki sarkaar lokapal kanoon ke bare main bhul hi gai
 The same Hindu newspaper reported on 27 July 2016 that the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha have passed the Lokpal and Lokayukta Amendment Bill 2016
 magar is sanshodhan kaa sambadh lokapal kii niyukti ke liye chayan samiti kii sharton ko badalanaa nahin tha
 You know that the Leader of the Selection Committee should be the Opposition but the Leader in the Lok Sabha is not the Opposition
 isliye niyukti nahin ho rahi he
 The amendment that was passed on 27 July was because by 31 July the authorities had to submit the details of the property of themselves and their families
 adhikariyon ke alaava enjio ke board member or trustee ko bhi sampatti kaa byora dena tha
 The amendment extended the July 31 deadline
 is vakt bhi bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii khub daavedaariyaan ho rahi hai
 Have they also forgotten those who fought the battle of Lokpal? notebandi ke hangaame main lokapal kaa zikr aayaa bhi to supreme court kii tippanee ke baad

 There are surveys of 'dainik Jagran' and 'hindustan'
 19 november ke 'dainik jaagran' ke survey kaa pehla sawaal he ki is kadam se hone vaali pareshaani ke baavjood aap iske paksh main hai? is survey main shaamil 86
 1 percent people said that yes
 kya bade note band karke sarkaar ne sahi kadam uthaaya he- 84
 8 percent of the people have said that they have taken the right steps
 chauthaa sawaal he ki kya isse kaala dhan samaapt ho jayega or aage iske raste band ho jaaenge
 In response to this, there is a huge change in the opinion of people
 25 pratishat log kehete hai ki sahamat nahin hai, 67
 2 percent say they agree
 jabaki sarkaar ke kadam ko acha maanane waalon kaa pratishat 84
 8 and 86
 1 pratishat he
 On 20 November, a survey is published in Hindi newspaper Dainik Hindustan
 jaagran ke survey main acha kadam bataane waalon kii pratishat 85 yaa usase adhik he
 The survey of Hindustan shows that the supporters of demonetisation decreased continuously in the last ten days
 8 november ko hi hindustan ke survey main 78 fisadi logon ne samarthan kiya tha
 Seven days later the number of supporters decreased to 61
 93 pratishat ho gai
 After 10 days, the number of supporters reduced to 46 percent
 times aaf india ne bhi 22 november ko si-voter kaa ek survey chapa he jiske anusaar 80 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki ve notebandi se hone vaali takalifon kii parvaah nahin karte
 The whole question is whether the supporters of the verdict or care about the suffering caused by it
 anna andolan ke dauraan hi arvind kejariwal ne lokapal se jude har pahalu par janamat sangrah kaa chalan shuru kiya tha
 In 2011, a survey was conducted in Old Delhi and Model Town regarding what the Lokpal should be like
 tab kaaphi mazaaq uda tha ki kanoon sansad ke vivek se banataa he yaa is tarah se missd kol vaale survey se
 These surveys have returned again in the era of demonetisation
 pradhanmantri ne ap jari kiya he jisapar kaale dhan ko lekar das sawaal puche gaye hai
 Such a big decision in Indian history
 usee tarah se lokapal ke bare main kaha jaataa tha or in survey par sawaal uthte the
 At that time Kejriwal used to survey and paste on Delhi's auto
 un survey kaa mazaaq udata tha, sawaal hote the
 Within Parliament, Sharad Yadav used to say that the law will be made at the discretion of the House
 tivi kii bahes or survey se nahin
 However, more than five lakh people have voted on the Prime Minister's app within 24 hours
 do sawaalon main to 98 or 99 pratishat samarthan main mat mili hai
 If you are potato farmer, poor people, laborer then you should also take part in the survey
 survey ke sawaal par bhi sawaal hua he, lekin pradhanmantri ne is aitihaasik bhagidaari ke liye sabakaa aabhaar jataayaa he
 Recall where all the tantrums, the bulls of the Lokpal era have become
 dost-dost aapas main ladane lage the
 New political loyalties were being formed
 kahin vahi sab to phir se nahin ho rahaa he
 Has debating between you and your group of friends not accelerated since demonetisation
 zarur hui hogi
 Recall what happened to the debates during Lokpal's time
 aam aadmi party ne centre ke lokapal ko sweekaar nahin kiya or apana janalokapal banane kaa elaan kar diya
 On 4 December 2015, the Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill was passed in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 isaki bhi aalochana hui
 It was said that when Chief Minister Kejriwal used to agitate, he used to say that if there will be more leaders in the appointment of Lokpal, then it cannot work honestly
 lekin jab dilli kaa janalokapal aayaa to usamen netaa hi zyaada the
 When it was criticized, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court was also included at the behest of Anna
 janalokapal bill paas hokar bhi lagu nahin hua he
 Nearly a year has passed for this too
 philhal dilli main lokayukta hai
 The comments donon daur ko yaad kiijie
 There was so much pride among the leaders
 bhrashtachar ko mitaane vaala lokapal aayaa bhi nahin
 But during this time many laws were made to fight corruption, SIT was made
 aghoshit sampatti ghoshit karne kii yojana ai
 Demonetisation came, but the post of Lokpal remained vacant
 notebandi se hone vaali pareshaaniyon or sarkaar kii lachar taiyaariyon ke khilaaf vipaksh ne 28 november ko deshvyapee aakrosh diwas kaa elaan kiya he
 At that time also, on 23 August 2011, on the call of Anna Hazare, 9 opposition parties of non-nda supported the nationwide movement
 lokapal nahin aayaa ye ek tathy he par aisa nahin he ki sarkaar lokapal kanoon ke bare main bhul hi gai
 The same Hindu newspaper reported on 27 July 2016 that the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha have passed the Lokpal and Lokayukta Amendment Bill 2016
 magar is sanshodhan kaa sambadh lokapal kii niyukti ke liye chayan samiti kii sharton ko badalanaa nahin tha
 You know that the Leader of the Selection Committee should be the Opposition but the Leader in the Lok Sabha is not the Opposition
 isliye niyukti nahin ho rahi he
 The amendment that was passed on 27 July was because by 31 July the authorities had to submit the details of the property of themselves and their families
 adhikariyon ke alaava enjio ke board member or trustee ko bhi sampatti kaa byora dena tha
 The amendment extended the July 31 deadline
 is vakt bhi bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii khub daavedaariyaan ho rahi hai
 At that time, 125 crores who spoke in support of Lokpal spoke on behalf of Indians
 is vakt bhi notebandi ke samarthak 'puraa desh puraa desh' bol rahe hai
 How did the country forget the time of Lokpal
 notebandi ke samay vaala desh kaise nahin bhuulenge, ham kaise daawa kar sakate hai
 The appointment of Lokpal is one aspect
 lokapal naam kii sanstha kaa dhaancha kya taiyaar kar liya gaya he
 Prashant Bhushan's team had filed a petition in the Supreme Court on which the court's comment came
 lokapal se lekar notebandi tak sapana ek hi he, bhrashtachar mitna chahie
 Even demonetisators can fight again for Lokpal
 supreme court ne bhi kaha he ki lokapal ko ek ded letters nahin banane diya janaa chahie
 The government will have to set a deadline for this
 7 disambar ko phir se sunwaayee hogi
 The Leader of the Opposition is not in the current Lok Sabha and it is necessary to have a Leader of the Opposition in the committee appointed for the Lokpal
 niyukti ke isi niyam main badlaav karnaa he
 There are reports of record working of post-2014 Parliament sessions
 kai saare bill ke paas hone kii khabaren aati hai
 a bill that seemed like an impossible GST passed
 lokapal kii niyukti main kiski dilchaspee nahin he
 When did it become an opinion that the Lokpal has no role in eradicating corruption
 lokapal andolan ne media ko bhi badla tha
 The TV channels which were engaged in Bhoot Phantom became the broadcasting center of the fight for corruption
 ankaron ke maseehaa banane kaa daur yaheen se shuru hota he
 Freedom Part Two was launched
 sabko lag rahaa tha ki ve desh kii aazaadee ke liye ji jaan se bahes main jute hai
 As it is now being told that the problem you are going through is for the country
 aam log tivi studio se lekar mike par aa gaye
 The media unleashed that hunger
 bhrashtachar mitaane ke kaaryakramon ko tiarapy milane lagi
 Lokpal was the turning point due to which the closed studio walls of the TV collapsed
 aam logon kii baat pahunchane lagi
 Passionate debate is going on even today, just need to remind someone that similar debate has been done earlier
 zyada nahin teen saal pehle
 Like this time, a lot of surveys were being done at that time
 news channel sienen, ibien or sienbisi tivi 18 ne siesds ke saath milakar ek akhil bhartiya survey kiya tha
 The 'hindu' newspaper was also published
 9 agast 2011 ke first post main is survey par report chhapi
 34 percent of the people surveyed said that the name of Lokpal was heard
 24 pratishat logon ne kaha tha ki unhen pataa he ki lokapal kya he
 Among educated people, 67 percent had heard about Lokpal and 51 percent said that they know what Lokpal is
 aise survey tamaam channelon or akhabaaron ne kiye honge, lekin us samay ke survey kaa sawaal thik lagata he ki jis lokapal ko lekar itnaa hangaamaa he zaraa poocha to jaae ki kitne logon ne naam suna he or kitne logon ko lokapal kaa matlab pataa he
 The questions in that survey were very nuanced
 lokapal par aapke kya mat hai? kya aap sarkaar ke tark se sahamat hai? kya aap anna hazaare ke tark se sahamat hai? It is being said that only the rich are corrupt, but the survey at that time asked about five categories of which are the most corrupt - government, elected representatives, judiciary, businessmen, industrialists, ngos and media
 survey main shaamil 32 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki sarkaar sabase bhrasht he or 43 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki chune hue netaa sabase bhrasht hai
 Similar surveys are also being conducted these days
 notebandi ke baad mukhya sawaal yahi ho gaya he ki aap sarkaar ke faisle se khush hai yaa nahin
 Survey questions are around this
 tab lokapal ko log bhrashtachar kaa muktidaata maan kar survey main shaamil ho rahe the, ab use bhul kar log notebandi ko nayaa muktidaata maanane lage hai
 Even then there were the same people, still the same people
 kya lokapal kii tarah kuch sawaal is tarah se puche ja sakate hai jaise -kya aap jaanate hai ki kaala dhan kaise kaise banataa he? Do you know what are the types of black money other than cash notes? kya aap jaanate hai ki farji company banaakar duusare deshon main paisa rakhaa jaataa he? Do you believe that black money will be eradicated only by demonetisation? lokapal ke samay yah poocha gaya ki aap iske bare main kitna jaanate hai
 At the time of demonetisation it should also be asked what you know about black money
 ab har koi yahi puch rahaa he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? kam se kam mukhya sawaal to yahi he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? bhrashtachar ke khilaaf karrwai kaa virodh wo bhi nahin karegaa jo bhrashtachar main shaamil he
 There are surveys of 'dainik Jagran' and 'hindustan'

 From Lokpal to demonetisation the dream is the same, corruption should be eradicated
 notebandi vaale bhi lokapal ke liye phir se sangharsh kar sakate hai
 The Supreme Court has also said that the Lokpal should not be allowed to become a dead letter
 sarkaar ko iske liye ek dedline tay kerani hogi
 There will be a hearing again on 7 December
 maujuuda loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin he or lokapal kii niyukti kii cameti main netaa vipaksh kaa hona zaruri he
 This rule of appointment has to be changed
 2014 ke baad ke sansad ke satron ke ricard kaam karne kii khabaren aati hai
 There are reports of many bills passing
 jiesti jaisaa asambhav sa lagane vaala bill paas ho gaya
 Who is not interested in the appointment of Lokpal? yah raay kab ban gai ki bhrashtachar mitaane main lokapal kaa koi role hi nahin he
 The Lokpal movement also changed the media
 jo tivi channel bhoot pret main lage hue the ve bhrashtachar kii ladaai kaa prasaaran centre ban gaye
 It is here that the period of anchors becoming the Messiah begins
 azaadi part tu laanch kar di gai
 Everyone felt that they are busy arguing for the independence of the country
 jaisaa ab bataaya ja rahaa he ki aap jis takalif se guzar rahe hai wo desh ke liye he
 Common people moved from TV studio to mic
 media ne us bhukh ko ujagar kiya
 Programs to eradicate corruption started getting trps
 lokapal hi wo terning point tha jiske kaaran tivi ke band studio kii deevaaren dhah gayi
 The talk of common people started reaching
 jununee bahes aaj bhi ho rahi he bas kisi ko yaad dilaane kii zarurat he ki aisi hi bahes pehle bhi ho chuki he
 Not much three years ago
 is vakt kii tarah us vakt bhi khub survey ho rahe the
 News channels CNN, IBN and CNBC TV18 conducted an all India survey in association with CSDS
 'hindu' akhbaar ne bhi chapa tha
 The report on this survey appeared in the First Post of 9 August 2011
 survey main shaamil 34 pratishat logon ne kaha tha ki lokapal kaa naam suna he
 24 percent people said that they know what the Lokpal is
 padhe-likhe logon main 67 fisadi ne lokapal ke bare main suna tha or 51 pratishat ne kaha tha ki unhen pataa he ki lokapal kya he
 All such channels and newspapers may have conducted such surveys, but the question of the survey at that time seems to be that the question about which Lokpal is such a ruckus, if asked how many people have heard the name and how many people know the meaning of Lokpal
 us survey ke sawaal kaaphi baarik the
 What is your opinion on Lokpal? Do you agree with the government's argument? Do you agree with Anna Hazare's argument? abhi kaha ja rahaa he ki sirf amir bhrasht hai, lekin us vakt ke survey main paanch catagori ke bare main poocha gaya tha ki inamen se koun sabase bhrasht he - sarkaar, nirvaachit pratinidhi, nyaaypalika, bijnesaman, udyogpati, enjio or media
 32 per cent of the people surveyed said that the government is the most corrupt and 43 per cent said that the elected leaders are the most corrupt
 isi tarah ke survey in dinon bhi ho rahe hai
 After demonetization, the main question has become whether you are happy with the decision of the government or not
 survey ke sawaal isi ke aasapaas hai
 At that time, people were joining the survey by considering Lokpal as the savior of corruption, now forgetting it, people have started considering demonetisation as the new liberator
 tab bhi vahi log the, ab bhi yahi log hai
 Can some questions like Lokpal be asked in this way - Do you know how to make black money? kya aap jaanate hai ki nagdi note ke alaava kaala dhan kitne prakaar ke hote hai? Do you know that money is kept in other countries by creating a fake company? kya aap maanate hai ki sirf notebandi se hi kaala dhan mit jayega? At the time of Lokpal it was asked how much you know about it
 notebandi ke samay bhi poocha janaa chahie ki aap kaala dhan ke bare main kya jaanate hai
 Now everyone is asking, are you with the decision of the government? At least the main question is, are you with the government's decision? Action against corruption will not oppose anyone who is involved in corruption
 'dainik jaagran' or 'hindustan' ke survey hai
 The first question of the survey of 'dainik Jagran' of 19 November is that despite the problems caused by this step, are you in favor of it? 86 included in this survey
 1 pratishat logon ne kaha he ki haa hai
 Has the government taken the right step by closing big notes - 84
 8 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki sahi kadam uthaaya he
 The fourth question is whether this will eliminate black money and further stop its path
 iske jawaab main logon kii raay main baari badlaav dikhataa he
 25 percent say they don't agree, 67
 2 fisadi kehete hai ki sahamat hai
 While 84 percent of those who consider the government's move to be good
 8 or 86
 1 percent
 20 november ko hindi akhbaar dainik hindustan main ek survey prakashit hota he
 In Jagran's survey, the percentage of those who show good steps is 85 or more
 hindustan kaa survey bataata he ki pichley das din main notebandi ke samarthak lagaataar kam hue
 On 8 November, 78 per cent of the people in the survey of Hindustan supported
 saat din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghatakar 61
 93 percent
 10 din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghat kar 46 pratishat ho gai
 The Times of India also conducted a c-voter survey on November 22, according to which 80 per cent people said that they do not care about the problems caused by demonetisation
 sara sawaal isi par he ki faisle ke samarthak hai yaa isse hui takalif ko parvaah karte hai yaa nahin
 It was during the Anna movement that Arvind Kejriwal started a referendum on every aspect related to the Lokpal
 2011 main lokapal kaisaa hona chahie ise lekar puraani dilli or model toun main survey kara diya gaya tha
 There was a lot of mockery then that the law was made by the discretion of the Parliament or by such a survey with missed calls
 notebandi ke daur main yahi survey phir se laut aae hai
 The Prime Minister has released an app on which ten questions have been asked about black money
 bhartiya itihaas kaa itnaa bada faisla
 In the same way, it was said about the Lokpal and these surveys raised questions
 us samay kejariwal survey karke dilli ke auto par chipka dete the
 Those surveys used to be mocked, questions were asked
 sansad ke bheetar sharad yadav kaha karte the ki kanoon sadan ke vivek se banegaa
 Not from TV debate and survey
 vaise 24 ghante ke bheetar pradhanmantri ke ap par paanch lakh se zyada logon ne vot kar diya he
 Two questions have polled 98 and 99 percent support
 agar aap aalu kisaan hai, garib janata hai, mazdoor hai to aapako bhi survey main hissaa lenaa chahie
 The question of the survey has also been questioned, but the Prime Minister has thanked everyone for this historic partnership
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke daur kii wo tamaam talkhiyaan, teziyaan kahaan hawa ho gayi hai
 Friends and friends started fighting among themselves
 nai raajnneetik nishthaaen ban rahi thim
 Is all of that happening again? kya notebandi ke baad se aap or aapke mitra samooh main bahesbaazi tej nahin hui he
 It must have happened
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke vakt kii bahason kaa kya hua
 The Aam Aadmi Party did not accept the Lokpal of the Center and announced to make it its Jan Lokpal
 4 disambar 2015 ko dilli vidhansabha main dilli janalokapal bill paas ho gaya
 It was also criticized
 kaha gaya ki jab mukhyamantri kejariwal andolan karte the tab kehete the ki lokapal kii niyukti main netaa zyaada honge to eemaandaaree se kaam nahin kar saktaa he
 But when Janlokpal of Delhi came, there were more leaders in it
 jab isaki aalochana hui to anna ke kehane par dilli hoicourt ke purv chif justise ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 The Jan Lokpal bill has not been implemented even after passing
 iske bhi paas hue kareeb ek saal hone ko aa gaye hai
 Currently, there are Lokayuktas in Delhi
 tippaniyan Recall both rounds
 netaaon main kitna ghamaasan hota tha
 The Lokpal to eradicate corruption did not even come
 lekin is dauraan bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye kai kanoon bane, esaiti bani
 The plan came to declare undisclosed assets
 notebandi aa gai, magar lokapal kaa pad khaali rah gaya
 Opposition has declared a nationwide outrage day on 28 November against the troubles caused by demonetisation and the government's poor preparations
 us vakt bhi yani 23 agast 2011 ko anna hazaare ke aahwan par gaiyr endie ke 9 vipakshi dalon ne rashtravyapee andolan kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Lokpal did not come, it is a fact but it is not that the government forgot about the Lokpal Act
 isi 27 july 2016 ke hindu akhbaar kii report he ki rajya sabha or loksabhaa ne lokapal or lokayukta sanshodhan bill 2016 paas kar diya he
 But this amendment did not change the terms of the selection committee for the appointment of Lokpal
 aap jaanate hai ki chayan samiti main netaa vipaksh hona chahie magar loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin he
 Therefore, the appointment is not taking place
 27 july ko jo sanshodhan paas hua wo isliye tha ki 31 july tak adhikariyon ko apni or apane parijanon kii sampatti kaa byora jamaa karnaa tha
 Apart from the officials, the board members and trustees of the NGO were also required to give details of the assets
 sanshodhan ke zariye 31 july kii samay seemaa badha di gai
 Even today, there are many claims to eradicate corruption
 azaadi part tu laanch kar di gai
 Everyone felt that they are busy arguing for the independence of the country
 jaisaa ab bataaya ja rahaa he ki aap jis takalif se guzar rahe hai wo desh ke liye he
 Common people moved from TV studio to mic
 media ne us bhukh ko ujagar kiya

 lokapal hi wo terning point tha jiske kaaran tivi ke band studio kii deevaaren dhah gayi

 sara sawaal isi par he ki faisle ke samarthak hai yaa isse hui takalif ko parvaah karte hai yaa nahin
 It was during the Anna movement that Arvind Kejriwal started a referendum on every aspect related to the Lokpal
 2011 main lokapal kaisaa hona chahie ise lekar puraani dilli or model toun main survey kara diya gaya tha
 There was a lot of mockery then that the law was made by the discretion of the Parliament or by such a survey with missed calls
 notebandi ke daur main yahi survey phir se laut aae hai
 The Prime Minister has released an app on which ten questions have been asked about black money
 bhartiya itihaas kaa itnaa bada faisla
 In the same way, it was said about the Lokpal and these surveys raised questions
 us samay kejariwal survey karke dilli ke auto par chipka dete the
 Those surveys used to be mocked, questions were asked
 sansad ke bheetar sharad yadav kaha karte the ki kanoon sadan ke vivek se banegaa
 Not from TV debate and survey
 vaise 24 ghante ke bheetar pradhanmantri ke ap par paanch lakh se zyada logon ne vot kar diya he
 Two questions have polled 98 and 99 percent support
 agar aap aalu kisaan hai, garib janata hai, mazdoor hai to aapako bhi survey main hissaa lenaa chahie
 The question of the survey has also been questioned, but the Prime Minister has thanked everyone for this historic partnership
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke daur kii wo tamaam talkhiyaan, teziyaan kahaan hawa ho gayi hai
 Friends and friends started fighting among themselves
 nai raajnneetik nishthaaen ban rahi thim
 Is all of that happening again? kya notebandi ke baad se aap or aapke mitra samooh main bahesbaazi tej nahin hui he
 It must have happened
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke vakt kii bahason kaa kya hua
 The Aam Aadmi Party did not accept the Lokpal of the Center and announced to make it its Jan Lokpal
 4 disambar 2015 ko dilli vidhansabha main dilli janalokapal bill paas ho gaya
 It was also criticized
 kaha gaya ki jab mukhyamantri kejariwal andolan karte the tab kehete the ki lokapal kii niyukti main netaa zyaada honge to eemaandaaree se kaam nahin kar saktaa he
 But when Janlokpal of Delhi came, there were more leaders in it
 jab isaki aalochana hui to anna ke kehane par dilli hoicourt ke purv chif justise ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 The Jan Lokpal bill has not been implemented even after passing
 iske bhi paas hue kareeb ek saal hone ko aa gaye hai
 Currently, there are Lokayuktas in Delhi
 tippaniyan Recall both rounds
 netaaon main kitna ghamaasan hota tha
 The Lokpal to eradicate corruption did not even come
 lekin is dauraan bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye kai kanoon bane, esaiti bani
 The plan came to declare undisclosed assets
 notebandi aa gai, magar lokapal kaa pad khaali rah gaya
 Opposition has declared a nationwide outrage day on 28 November against the troubles caused by demonetisation and the government's poor preparations
 us vakt bhi yani 23 agast 2011 ko anna hazaare ke aahwan par gaiyr endie ke 9 vipakshi dalon ne rashtravyapee andolan kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Lokpal did not come, it is a fact but it is not that the government forgot about the Lokpal Act
 isi 27 july 2016 ke hindu akhbaar kii report he ki rajya sabha or loksabhaa ne lokapal or lokayukta sanshodhan bill 2016 paas kar diya he
 But this amendment did not change the terms of the selection committee for the appointment of Lokpal
 aap jaanate hai ki chayan samiti main netaa vipaksh hona chahie magar loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin he
 Therefore, the appointment is not taking place
 27 july ko jo sanshodhan paas hua wo isliye tha ki 31 july tak adhikariyon ko apni or apane parijanon kii sampatti kaa byora jamaa karnaa tha
 Apart from the officials, the board members and trustees of the NGO were also required to give details of the assets
 sanshodhan ke zariye 31 july kii samay seemaa badha di gai
 Even today, there are many claims to eradicate corruption
 is vakt kii tarah us vakt bhi khub survey ho rahe the
 News channels CNN, IBN and CNBC TV18 conducted an all India survey in association with CSDS
 'hindu' akhbaar ne bhi chapa tha
 The report on this survey appeared in the First Post of 9 August 2011
 survey main shaamil 34 pratishat logon ne kaha tha ki lokapal kaa naam suna he
 24 percent people said that they know what the Lokpal is
 padhe-likhe logon main 67 fisadi ne lokapal ke bare main suna tha or 51 pratishat ne kaha tha ki unhen pataa he ki lokapal kya he
 All such channels and newspapers may have conducted such surveys, but the question of the survey at that time seems to be that the question about which Lokpal is such a ruckus, if asked how many people have heard the name and how many people know the meaning of Lokpal
 us survey ke sawaal kaaphi baarik the
 What is your opinion on Lokpal? Do you agree with the government's argument? Do you agree with Anna Hazare's argument? abhi kaha ja rahaa he ki sirf amir bhrasht hai, lekin us vakt ke survey main paanch catagori ke bare main poocha gaya tha ki inamen se koun sabase bhrasht he - sarkaar, nirvaachit pratinidhi, nyaaypalika, bijnesaman, udyogpati, enjio or media
 32 per cent of the people surveyed said that the government is the most corrupt and 43 per cent said that the elected leaders are the most corrupt
 isi tarah ke survey in dinon bhi ho rahe hai
 After demonetization, the main question has become whether you are happy with the decision of the government or not
 survey ke sawaal isi ke aasapaas hai
 At that time, people were joining the survey by considering Lokpal as the savior of corruption, now forgetting it, people have started considering demonetisation as the new liberator
 tab bhi vahi log the, ab bhi yahi log hai
 Can some questions like Lokpal be asked in this way - Do you know how to make black money? kya aap jaanate hai ki nagdi note ke alaava kaala dhan kitne prakaar ke hote hai? Do you know that money is kept in other countries by creating a fake company? kya aap maanate hai ki sirf notebandi se hi kaala dhan mit jayega? At the time of Lokpal it was asked how much you know about it
 notebandi ke samay bhi poocha janaa chahie ki aap kaala dhan ke bare main kya jaanate hai
 Now everyone is asking, are you with the decision of the government? At least the main question is, are you with the government's decision? Action against corruption will not oppose anyone who is involved in corruption
 'dainik jaagran' or 'hindustan' ke survey hai

 sanshodhan ke zariye 31 july kii samay seemaa badha di gai
 Even today, there are many claims to eradicate corruption
 aise survey tamaam channelon or akhabaaron ne kiye honge, lekin us samay ke survey kaa sawaal thik lagata he ki jis lokapal ko lekar itnaa hangaamaa he zaraa poocha to jaae ki kitne logon ne naam suna he or kitne logon ko lokapal kaa matlab pataa he
 The questions in that survey were very nuanced
 lokapal par aapke kya mat hai? kya aap sarkaar ke tark se sahamat hai? kya aap anna hazaare ke tark se sahamat hai? It is being said that only the rich are corrupt, but the survey at that time asked about five categories of which are the most corrupt - government, elected representatives, judiciary, businessmen, industrialists, ngos and media
 survey main shaamil 32 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki sarkaar sabase bhrasht he or 43 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki chune hue netaa sabase bhrasht hai
 Similar surveys are also being conducted these days
 notebandi ke baad mukhya sawaal yahi ho gaya he ki aap sarkaar ke faisle se khush hai yaa nahin
 Survey questions are around this
 tab lokapal ko log bhrashtachar kaa muktidaata maan kar survey main shaamil ho rahe the, ab use bhul kar log notebandi ko nayaa muktidaata maanane lage hai
 Even then there were the same people, still the same people
 kya lokapal kii tarah kuch sawaal is tarah se puche ja sakate hai jaise -kya aap jaanate hai ki kaala dhan kaise kaise banataa he? Do you know what are the types of black money other than cash notes? kya aap jaanate hai ki farji company banaakar duusare deshon main paisa rakhaa jaataa he? Do you believe that black money will be eradicated only by demonetisation? lokapal ke samay yah poocha gaya ki aap iske bare main kitna jaanate hai
 At the time of demonetisation it should also be asked what you know about black money
 ab har koi yahi puch rahaa he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? kam se kam mukhya sawaal to yahi he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? bhrashtachar ke khilaaf karrwai kaa virodh wo bhi nahin karegaa jo bhrashtachar main shaamil he
 There are surveys of 'dainik Jagran' and 'hindustan'
 19 november ke 'dainik jaagran' ke survey kaa pehla sawaal he ki is kadam se hone vaali pareshaani ke baavjood aap iske paksh main hai? is survey main shaamil 86
 1 percent people said that yes
 kya bade note band karke sarkaar ne sahi kadam uthaaya he- 84
 8 percent of the people have said that they have taken the right steps
 chauthaa sawaal he ki kya isse kaala dhan samaapt ho jayega or aage iske raste band ho jaaenge
 In response to this, there is a huge change in the opinion of people
 25 pratishat log kehete hai ki sahamat nahin hai, 67
 2 percent say they agree
 jabaki sarkaar ke kadam ko acha maanane waalon kaa pratishat 84
 8 and 86
 1 pratishat he
 On 20 November, a survey is published in Hindi newspaper Dainik Hindustan
 jaagran ke survey main acha kadam bataane waalon kii pratishat 85 yaa usase adhik he
 The survey of Hindustan shows that the supporters of demonetisation decreased continuously in the last ten days
 8 november ko hi hindustan ke survey main 78 fisadi logon ne samarthan kiya tha
 Seven days later the number of supporters decreased to 61
 93 pratishat ho gai
 After 10 days, the number of supporters reduced to 46 percent
 times aaf india ne bhi 22 november ko si-voter kaa ek survey chapa he jiske anusaar 80 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki ve notebandi se hone vaali takalifon kii parvaah nahin karte
 The whole question is whether the supporters of the verdict or care about the suffering caused by it
 anna andolan ke dauraan hi arvind kejariwal ne lokapal se jude har pahalu par janamat sangrah kaa chalan shuru kiya tha
 In 2011, a survey was conducted in Old Delhi and Model Town regarding what the Lokpal should be like
 tab kaaphi mazaaq uda tha ki kanoon sansad ke vivek se banataa he yaa is tarah se missd kol vaale survey se
 These surveys have returned again in the era of demonetisation
