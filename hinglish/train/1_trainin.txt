 disambar ke maheene main unhone twitor par 'master blaster' sachin tendulkar ko pachhad diya he
 The number of his followers on Twitter is approaching 50 lakhs, while the number of people who like his page on Facebook has reached close to 20 lakhs
 in sabake bich unka bollywood kii star abhinetri anoushka sharma ke saath romance chal rahaa he or apane is rishte ko jis dildaari se viraat kohli ne jagajaahir kiya he, vah unki khaas style ban chukaa he
 This style of sending 'kiss' to Anushka via bat was shocking after scoring a century in odis against Sri Lanka
 kohli ne jab isi style ko melbern main doharaaya, to yahi jaahir hua ki kohli us yuva peedi kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe hai, jo apni chaahaton ko apane hi tareeke se izhaar karnaa chahta he
 Actually, every step of Virat Kohli is proving to be a success, he has a great popularity in the Indian market of advertising too
 yah dhooma is kadar he ki landan sthit sports pro magazine ne unhen saal 2014 ke sabase marketeble sportsstar main duniya main duusare number par rakhaa he
 In such a situation, everyone's eyes will be on Virat Kohli in the coming year
 jis tarah se unhone australia ke khilaaf test siries main damdaar ballebaaji kii he, usase jaahir he ki nae saal main bhi unka balla dhamal karata najar aayega, lekin is siries main sabase badi baat yah najar ai ki vah captaini ke sabase mushkil chunauti ko nibhaane ke liye bilkul taiyaar hai, vah bhi test kii captaini ke liye
 In the first match of the Test series against Australia, Kohli landed as the captain of Team India
 unke kariyar main yah pehla mauka tha, jab vah test main captaini kar rahe the
 In the first innings of the Adelaide Test, he hit 115 runs and in the second innings, he scored 141 runs in the close innings to give Team India an unforgettable win
 364 ranon ke vishaal lakshya ke saamne kohli kii team 48 ranon se haar gai
 But Kohli showed that the aggressive attitude that should be captained in a Test match is present in them
 test captaini main debyue karte hue kohli ne donon pariyon main shatak banane kaa karishma dikhaaya he
 He became only the second captain in the world to reach this point
 isse pehle australian captain greg chapel ne yah karnama 1975 main west indies ke khilaaf brisben ke maidan main dikhaaya tha
 But more than that, he encouraged Team India batsmen to chase a tough challenge
 vanade main ab tak mili maukon par kohli ne 17 maichon main team kii captaini kii he or 14 main team india ko jeet hasil hui
 He has also completed the charisma of reaching 6,000 runs in just 136 matches in ODI cricket
 aise main unhen mahendra singh dhoni kii jagah team india kii kaman saunpane kii maang jor pakad rahi he
 The success of Team India under Dhoni's captaincy on foreign pitches is no longer too far from the captaincy of the team, Virat Kohli
 unki raah main, bas ek aadchan ho sakati he, agar mahendra singh dhoni kii captaini main team india ne australia or newjiland main world cap jeet liya, to dhoni ko captaini se hataane kii maang apane aap khatm ho jaaegi
 However, it is also possible that Dhoni himself vacates himself as India's most successful captain
 philhal, cricket ke maidan or maidan se baahar, aane vaala saal nishchit taur par viraat kohli kaa hi najar aa rahaa he
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday praised the General Budget presented in the Lok Sabha for the year 2013-14 and said that the Union Finance Minister has done commendable work
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki vitt mantri ne ghaataa ko simit rakh kar or saath hi vikaas kii aavashyaktaaon par bhi dhyaan dekar saraahneey kaary kiya he
 He said that during the 12th Plan period we need to create one crore jobs every year
 yah lakshya tabhi hasil ho saktaa he jab ham aath fisadi sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) vikaas dar hasil karen

 uttari dilli kaa ek gumnaam-sa ilaaka he mukherjee nagar
 It rarely gathers the headlines of newspapers, but for the last one month this area has become famous all over the country
 yahaan or iske padosi mohallon jaise nehru vihaar, gandhi vihaar or indira vihaar ke lagbhag har ghar main civil seva pariksha kii taiyaari karne vaale yuvak-yuvatiyaan rahete hai
 Most of them appear in this exam through Hindi medium
 kam-se-kam pichley 25 saal se yah ilaaka iees kii taiyaari ke adde ke rup main vikhyath he
 The young people who are preparing to stay here are generally considered to be calm, gentle and nautical
 25 saal main aisa kabhi nahin hua ki in yuvaaon ne apni bheed yaa baahubal kaa aatank sthaneey logon ko dikhaaya ho
 But nowadays these young people are very angry
 naaraazgi kaa alam yah he ki inamen se lagbhag 10,000 noujvaan 27 june kii subah achaanak sadakon par utar aae or tab se apane kamaron main nahin laute hai
 Apart from long hikes up to Rajghat, India Gate and Race Course, there have been many such attempts like candle march, fast unto death, but are not ready to give up
 do baar to sarkaar kii vaada khilaaphi yaa taanaashaahee ne inhen apana sanyam khone par bhi majaboor kar diya or us dauraan is ilaake main police kii gypsy se lekar ditisi kii basen or motor cycilen dhu-dhu kar jalati hui dekhi gayi
 The recent news is that this movement has not spread to this locality but has spread to more or less Allahabad, Lucknow, Banaras, Patna, Bhopal, Jaipur, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Guwahati
 sawaal he ki in yuvaaon kii naaraazgi kisase or kyon he? sach yah he ki ye upiessi or bharat sarkaar, donon se naaraaz hai
 They claim that UPSC has taken away their dream by linguistically discriminating against them under a conspiracy
 yun to yah sajeesh pichley 2-3 saal se chal rahi thi, lekin 2013 kii pariksha ke antim nattejey ne to ise puri tarah benakaab kar diya
 Let me tell you that for the last several years, the participation of Hindi medium candidates in the final results was 10-15 per cent, while in the 2013 results, it has come down to 2-3 per cent
 lagbhag yahi suuratehaal tamil, telegu or bangla jaisi baaki bhartiya bhashaaon kaa bhi he
 The root of the controversy is that in 2011 the UPSC approved Prof
 es
 K
 khanna samiti kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par civil seva praarambhik pariksha ke dhaanche main pherbadal kiya
 Earlier this exam consisted of two papers — an optional subject of 300 marks and a general study of 150 marks
 ummidavaar ek vrahat suchi main se apni prishthbhumi yaa dilchaspee kaa vaikalpik vishay chunate the or uske gambhir adhyayan kii badaulat praarambhik pariksha main safalataa hasil kar lete the
 In this method, a certain percentage of candidates from every subject were successful, so excellent students of every subject were confident of being successful
 kul milakar, ek 'sens of praporshan’ bana hua tha jo praaia: andeh kii gunjaaish nahin chodta tha
 In 2011, in a new pattern implemented on the basis of the recommendations of the Khanna Committee, UPSC removed the optional subject from the preliminary examination and introduced a new paper called 'CSAT' (civil Services Aptitude Test)
 is nae dhaanche kaa nateeja yah hua ki jahaan 2011 se pehle mukhya pariksha main baithne vaale (praarambhik pariksha uteern karne vaale) ummidavaaron main 40-45 fisadi sankhya hindi madhyam ke ummidavaaron kii rahati thi, vahiin 2011 se yah ghatakar 15-16 fisadi ke aasapaas rah gai
 More or less the same situation happened to candidates of other Indian languages such as Tamil, Marathi and Punjabi
 masalan, agar 2008 or 2011 main mukhya pariksha main shaamil ummidavaaron kii sankhya kii tulana karen to yah tamil main 98 se ghatakar 14 rah gai, telegu main114 se 29 or kannada main 14 se 5 par pahunch gai jabaki isi samay main angreji madhyam se mukhya pariksha dene waalon kii sankhya 51
 6 per cent to 82
 9 fisadi ho gai
 Naturally, the candidates of Indian languages started to feel that now they are not even able to pass the preliminary examination
 uthalepan se is samasya par tippanee kar rahe kuch abhijaat buddhijivi, mediakarmi or afasarshah yah sabit karne par tule hai ki in ummidavaaron kii vifaltaa kii vajah inaki ayogyata he
 This is a vicious lie
 sach yah he ki is sankat kii jaden in chaatro kii kathith ayogyata main nahin, balki pariksha pattern main nihit bhedbhaav main chhipi hai
 For example, out of the total 80 of CSAT, 8-9 questions are asked only in English, with a total weightage of 20 to 22
 5 ankon kaa hota he
 These questions are very easy for students of convent schools, while difficult for rural and non-english speakers from government schools
 mushkil yah he ki agar kisi se do sawaal bhi galat ho jaaen to 5 ank to katenge hi, uske alaava negative marking kii vajah se 1
 67 more marks will be deducted
 isi paper main 30-35 sawaal comprihension kshamta ko parakhane ke liye puche jate hai lekin unka hindi anuwaad kisi duusare grah kii bhashaa main hota he (jaise Cloud Computing ke liye badal computing, Credit Based Education System ke liye rin aadhaarit shiksha vyavastha, Tablet Computer ke liye goli computer or Land Reforms ke liye aarthik sudhaar)
 The reason for the problem is that if a student of Hindi wants to answer such an unintelligible language, then 8-10 questions are bound to be wrong
 agar vah sahi arth kii talash main angreji ke prashn bhi dekhe to samay kii kami se kuch prashn chhot sakate hai
 The squeeze is that in the exam in which hundreds of candidates are eliminated due to cut-throat competition by a margin of one mark, the candidates of Indian languages were forced to lose about 20-30 marks
 aaj jo upiessi ise galat anuwaad kahkar taal rahi he, usne na to apni ore se is samasya kaa sangyaan tak liya or na hi in chaatro ko hue nuksaan kii bharpai kii
 The questions of the General Studies paper were deliberately made so difficult that hardly anyone could correct more than 60-65 out of 100, whereas the level of CSAT paper was such that candidates who are proficient in English and technical knowledge could easily get out of 80
 Close to 70 (sometimes even 79-80) questions
 saamaanya adhyayan kaa ek prashn do ankon kaa hota he jabaki sisat kaa 2
 5 digits
 chunki merit kaa nirdhaaran donon prashnpatron ke ankon ko jodakar hota he, isi kaa asar he ki 2011 ke baad se is pariksha main safal hone vaale ummidavaaron kii aarthik-saamaajik prishthbhumi main jameen-aasmaan kaa antar aa gaya he
 The Nigvekar Committee, constituted by the UPSC itself, assesses that "CSAT benefits English-medium competitors in urban areas and creates difficulties for rural area competitors
" ”sawaal he ki andolan kar rahe chaatr aakhir chaahate kya hai? kya ye angreji or globaligeshan ke virdohi hai? kya ye apni ayogyata ko dhakne kaa bahaanaa khoj rahe hai? nahin
 off course not
 ye sirf bhashaayi bhedbhaav ke virdohi hai
 Just consider their arguments: To become a good civil servant one needs knowledge of English or Indian language too? The Kothari Commission recommended that in the preliminary examination, one paper should be of English and one of Indian language, and both should have equal weight
 nigavekar samiti ne mukhya pariksha ke bare main yahi salaah di
 All the committees, except the Khanna committee, seem to agree on the question that civil servants should be competent in both languages
 agar aisa he to sisat main sirf angreji bhashaa ke sawaal kyon puche jate hai? kyon na 8-9 prashn aise bhi rakhe jaaen jo sirf bhartiya bhashaaon main puche jaaen or unka angreji anuwaad na diya jaae? agar yah upiessi ko manjuur nahin he to sirf angreji ke prashnon ko hataaya jaae
 After all, everyone has to pass the qualifying paper of English in 1979 only
 comprihension ke jo sawaal donon bhashaaon main puche jate hai, unamem anuwaad se jujhne kaa sankat hindi waalon ke sir par hi kyon hona chahie? kyon na aisa kiya jaae ki hindi paath ko mul mana jaae or angreji main anuwaad karke sawaal puche jaaen? kalpana kiijie ki agar ram chidebaghar gaya kaa anuwaad Ram went to sparrows home ho or angrejibhashiyon kii safalataa kaa faisla isi bhashaa se hona ho to kya angreji ke buddhijivi is mudde ko utani aasaani se taal paaenge jaise aaj taal rahe hai?aisi sthiti main kya yah uchit nahin ki bhashaayi asamanta ke aadhaar par aise sawaal sisat se hataae jaaen? swayan upiessi kii nigavekar samiti ne is anuwaad ke bare main tippanee kii he ki ''angreji se kiya jane vaala anuwaad masini kism kaa hota he
 "3
 ganit, rijning, nirnayan or data-vyakhya ke prashnon se koi dikkat nahin he, lekin unka anupaat aisa nahin hona chahie ki kisi ek prishthbhumi ke chaatro ko nazaij phayda mili
 It is clear that these arguments of the agitators are not weak
 sarkaar or upiessi ko chahie ki yaa to in tarkon ko thos tareeke se khaarij karen, or nahin to yah jaruri he ki praarambhik pariksha ke dhaanche ko badla jaae
 This movement is not just for CSAT and preliminary examination
 mukhya pariksha or saahnatkaar main bhi bhartiya bhashaaon sang suniyojit bhedbhaav he
 For example, for examining the four papers of General Studies of Main Examination, the model answers are only in English
 unheen ke aadhaar par bhartiya bhashaaon kii uttar pustikaon kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 If UPSC has moral courage, it should issue the linguistic mark-table of any year
 usase yah baat saaf ho jaaegi ki bhartiya bhashaaon ke ummidavaaron ko lagbhag har paper main ausatan 15-25 ankon kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padataa he
 Similarly, linguistic discrimination appears in the interview as well
 hindi, tamil, bangla yaa anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke ummidavaaron par dabaav banaaya jaataa he ki ve angreji main intervyuu den, lekin aaj tak kisi ne nahin suna ki kisi angreji bhashi ummidavaar par kisi bhartiya bhashaa main intervyuu dene ke liye dabaav banaaya gaya ho
 If UPSC truly respects transparency, then it should declare interview marks for any year with linguistic classification so that the truth can be revealed
 is baat kaa daawa kiya ja saktaa he ki ausat rup se yah antar 20-25 ankon se kam nahin hoga

 Amit Sharma of Spartan Sportmus says that Gayle has been using his bat made here for the last two years
 amit sharma bataate hai ki gail 1250 se 1300 gram ke baari balle kii maang karte hai
 Gayle wants the weight and balance of his bat to be accurate
 sparton sports company ke amit sharma bataate hai ki kaarigaron ne balle ke vajan, balance ke alaava stroke kaa bhi bakhubi khyaal rakhaa
 Jyoti Sharma, MD, Spartan Sports, says that he has been sending cricket goods to Australia in the past
 lekin ye pehla mauqaa he, jab unke cricket ke saamaan kaa istemaal worldcup ke dauraan ho rahaa he
 It may be a danger for Team India that Gayle will use one such bat made here during the match against India in Perth on 6 March
 lekin bhartiya fans is baat se raahat mahasoos kar sakate hai ki bhartiya captain emes dhoni bhi sparton sports main bana balla hi istemaal karte hai

 i am saying this in my senses mumbai ke dadar ilaake main bane ambedkar bhawan ke bade hisse par shuukravaar der raat hathaudaa chalaane kaa maamla tool pakadta ja rahaa he
 Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar ke pote prakaash or anand raaj kii taharir par bhoiwada police ne pipuls impruvement trust ke khilaaf maamle main shikaayat darj kar lee he
 From 1930 onwards, Babasaheb used to take a political journey against slavery from the brick-stone building in Dadar, which once housed Babasaheb's library
 yahaan rakhi priting press se unki kalam chhapakar jati vyavastha se ladati thi
 But it was broken in the dark of night
 babasaheb ke parijan is tod-phod ke liye pipuls impruvement trust ko zimmedaar tehra rahe hai, unke khilaaf thane main exiaar bhi darj karwaai gai he
 The comments bhoiwada police stesan main shikaayat darj karaane vaale babasaheb ke pote prakaash ambedkar ne kaha, 'aitihaasik printig press ko barbaad kar diya, ye log trustee nahin hai, inaki trustiship ko charity kamishnar ne manyata bhi nahin di he, ye sirf zamin ke kaarobaari istemaal ke liye aisa kar rahe hai
 However, the people of the trust are rejecting all the allegations
 pipuls impruvement trust ke trustee shrikant gavare ne kaha, 'main 2001 se trustee hum, press trust kaa he, sirf press main rakhi mashine parivaar kii hai, jameen par babasaheb kaa smarak banegaa jisase samaaj kaa phayda ho, hamaare khilaaf lagaae gaye aarope galat hai
 ' mumbai mahanagarapalika ne building ko jarjar kii shrenee main rakhaa tha, lekin usne kaha he ki uske karmchaaree ise todane main shaamil nahin the
 At the same time, the Trust wants a 17-storey new building to be built at this place with parking and all facilities
 1930 se dadar main bani eent-pathar kii imaarat se babasaheb gulaami ke khilaaf siyaasi safahe bharte the, isi imaarat main kabhi babasaheb kaa pustkaalay tha
 He used to fight the caste system by printing his pen from the printing press held here
 lekin raat ke andhere main ise tod diya gaya
 Babasaheb's family is holding the People's Improvement Trust responsible for the sabotage, an FIR has also been lodged against them
 tippaniyan Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of Babasaheb, who lodged a complaint at Bhoiwara police station, said, "the historical printing press is ruined, these people are not trustees, their trusteeship has not even been recognized by the charity commissioner, it is only for the business use of the land
" We are doing this for ' haalanki trust ke log saare aaropon ko khaarij kar rahe hai
 Shrikant Gavre, trustee of People's Improvement Trust said, 'I am a trustee since 2001, the press trust is there, only the machines kept in the press belong to the family, Babasaheb's memorial will be built on the ground which will benefit the society, the allegations against us are false
 
 ' The Mumbai Municipal Corporation had categorized the building as dilapidated, but has said that its employees were not involved in demolishing it
 vahiin trust chahta he ki parking or sari suvidhaon se yukt is jagah par 17 manjila nai imaarat banaai jaae

 In the Delhi University Students' Union election, the student unit of the Congress NSUI has got a big success
 NSUI ne adhyaksh pad or upaadhyaksh pad kabja jamaaya he
 In the race for the post of President, Rocky Tussid of NSUI defeated Rajat Chaudhary of ABVP
 vahiin, ABVP ne joint secetrari or secetrari pad par kabja kiya he
 The counting of votes took a dramatic turn, with the first news that the NSUI held three major positions
 lekin baad main yah saaf hua ki do padon par NSUI or do padon par ABVP kii jeet hui he
 There was a tough contest during the count
 shuruaati round main ABVP ne chaaron padon par badhat banaai hui thi, to baad main NSUI ne badhat banaai
 Last year, ABVP captured 3 out of 4 seats in the central panel of DUSU
 bataa den ki pichley 4 saal se abivipi dusu par kaabiz he
 Four years later, NSUI was facing defeat for the last 4 years in this riot of Dusu
 4 saal baad adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh pad par NSUI kaa kabja hua he
 However, last year, Mohit Garid of NSUI won the post of Joint Secretary
 enesayuai ko ummid he ki is saal dusu jeetne main wo kaamyaab honge, lekin chunaav se thik pehle enesayuai ke presidend candidaterocky tusid kaa nominationaradd hone ke baad enesayuai ko duusari ummidavaar alka ke liye prachaar karnaa padaa
 But then there was confusion among DU students when the High Court verdict in favor of Rocky Tussaid changed the presidential candidate of NSUI
 haalanki soshal media campan ke jariye enesayuai ne presidend post ke liye jamkar prachaar kiya
 More than last time, DU students voted higher in the election
 pichley saal jahaan dusu chunaav main 36
 While 9 percent of the votes were cast, a total of 44 percent of the votes were cast in 32 colleges of the Morning College this year
 chunaav samiti ke mutabik morning college ke 77,379 chaatr-chaatraon main se 34,051 chaatr-chaatraon ne chunaav main matdaan kiya
 Voting in the morning colleges started off a bit
 haalanki 11 baje ke baad matdaan karne vaale chaatro kii bheed campus main nazar aayi
 du's Off Campus College had higher turnout than Campus College
 chunaav ko lekar evening college ke students ne bhi badi taadaad main hissaa liya
 In view of the DUSU election, DU was completely converted into a cantonment
 sabhi 51 matdaan kendron ke baahar police kii tainaati thi
 No bogus voting was allowed so no one was allowed inside the college

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator Who does not want to make love's memorable moments memorable? us dauraan kya karnaa chahie yah jaananaa jitna jaruri he utana hi mahatvapurn is baat se waakif rahanaa bhi he ki kya na kiya jaae
 Any mistake in those delicate moments can make fun
 ye hai wo 9 chijen jo aapako un palon ke dauraan bilkul nahin karnaa chahie
 1
 chuumane se kaisaa parhez:aap apane saathi ko pyaar karne ke dauraan hadabadi main to nahin rahete
 Many people do not kiss their partner at all in those moments of love
 kai baar apakipojishnaisi hoti he ki choomanaa mushkil ho jaataa he to kai baar log chuumane ko lay todane jaisaa maanate hai
 Kissing is as important during foreplay as it is during the last stage
 2
 Touch but with love: This is a beautiful symbol of love
 lekin iske liye jaruri he ki aap pehle apane saathi ko taiyaar kar len
 If your partner is not ready and you start to get teeth on his body, then it is very possible that he will start feeling cold or afraid of love
 donon hi sthitiyaan buree hai
 3
 tera dhyaan kidar he:kuch log bilkul arjuna kii tarah ekagra hokar intercorse karte hai
 Your partner wants you to pay attention to every part of his body
 agar aap sirf ek ang par nisaar hue ja rahe hai to ho saktaa he pyaar ke un najuk palon main aap achaanak se use swaarthee najar aane lagen
 4
 saathi par na daalen apana boj:lav mekking ke dauraan saathi ke bahut kareeb jane kii ichha main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 During this time, if you come on top of your partner, then make sure that you do not put the entire weight of the body on it
 aapke pyaar ke chakkar main agar usko saans lene main bhi dikkat hone lage to sach maniye saathi pyaar se zyada praathamikta jaan bachaane ko degaa
 5
 khaskar mardon ke liye:jaldi kaa kaam agar shaitan kaa hota he to der kar dene kaa bhi koi phayda nahin he
 When deciding how much time you want to be removed, take care of your partner too
 jaldi main aap use santusht nahin kar paaenge to der tak tik kar use pareshaan kar denge
 6
 bina bataaen charam par pahunchnaa:pyaar kaa to rishta hishering or keringse chalata he
 It is your responsibility to keep in mind that both reach the peak and have equal dealings in the rain of love
 iske liye bahut jaruri he ki aap apane saathi ko bataaen ki is khel ke anjaam par aap kitni der main pahunchane vaale hai taaki vah bhi taiyaar ho jaae
 7
 itnaa filmi bhi thik nahin:aap us kism kii filmon ke agar bahut shaukeen hai or unamem dikhaae gaye tamaam asana ko aajamaane kii koshish karte rahete hai to ek baar apane saathi se puch jarur lijie
 It should not happen that your partner will get upset because you are very naughty
 8
 Say something: In those moments of love, what good does it take for you to speak soft things in soft voice
 aapaki lambii khamoshi maahaul ko bojhil bana sakati he
 During this, a little compliment of the partner will also make a magic impact
 9
 Machine love: There must be some difference between loving and exercising in the gym
 agar aap bhi pyaar ke dauraan kuch nayaa tri nahin kar rahe to bahut jald aapako isse boriyat hone lagegi
 This is bad news for both of you

 In view of the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, a coalition of regional parties in the country is preparing to cut the economic master plan of the Modi government
 is gathbandhan ke ek netaa kaa daawa he ki vipakshi dal ekajute hokar ek sanyukt aarthik yojana taiyaar kar rahe hai
 This is a clear indication that the entire opposition is set to unite against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the upcoming elections
 andhra pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri or tidipi netaa chandrababu naidu ne roitre ko die intervyuu main kaha ki vipaksh kii yojana main pramukh vipakshi dal congress dwaara prastaavit nunatam aay kaarykram ko shaamil kiye jane kii sambhaavna he
 Significantly, Naidu has an important role in preparing the common program of this alliance of regional parties
 pichley maheene kolkata main is gathbandhan ke manch par 23 kshetreey raajnneetik dalon ne shirkat kii
 Naidu said that now the exercise of coalition is being done on poverty alleviation, agriculture, employment and minimum income program for each family
 modi sarkaar ke 5 saal, vittiya ghaataa sanbhaalane main paas yaa fail?chandrababu naidu ne kaha ‘kai raajnneetik dal sahmati banane par kaam kar rahe hai
 The problem of farmers is a very serious issue and unemployment is the biggest issue
 lihaaja, arthvyavastha par dhyaan kendrit karne kii jarurat he
 According to the India Today poll that came last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rating has reached its lowest level due to widespread unemployment and weak agricultural economy
 pole main yah bhi kaha gaya ki aagaamee chunaavon main sattarudh gathbandhan bahumat se peeche rah jaaegi jiske chalate kshetreey dalon kaa gathbandhan satta main aa saktaa he
 However, there is no consensus about leadership in the opposition parties and whether they can choose Congress President Rahul Gandhi as their leader on the basis of numbers after the election results, everyone has kept silence on this question
 pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke sawaal par naidu ne kaha ki ‘pradhanmantri kaa chayan nateezon ke baad aam sahmati se kiya jayega kyonki gathbandhan kii pehali praathamikta chunaavon main badi jeet hasil karne kii he
 'the money from here and the expenditure incurred in the state exchequer is worth mentioning that Naidu, as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, did a good job in the field of business ease in the state and prepared a company like Microsoft to invest in the state
 naidu kii tidipi sansad main bade kshetreey dalon main shumaar he or march 2018 tak vah sattarudh endie main shaamil thi lekin andhra pradesh ke liye special package kii maang ko lekar vah gathbandhan se baahar ho gai thi
 Since then, Naidu has launched a campaign to unite regional parties to oust the Modi government
 naidu kaa kahana he ki koi doosraa netaa modi se behatar hoga kyonki narendra modi kisi kii nahin sunate

 nitish kumaar par diene tippanee karne ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki bihar ke diene ke bare main jaanane ke liye har kisi ko ‘maanjhi’ film dekhni chahie
 After watching the film under a special arrangement, Kejriwal said, 'now that the Bihar elections are approaching, everyone should watch the' Manjhi 'film so that they can know what the DNA of Bihar is made of

 The film 'manjhi - The Mountain Man' is the story of poor laborer Dasaratha Manjhi, resident of Gehlaur village in Gaya district of Bihar, who made a path by cutting the mountain with only chisels and hammers
 kejariwal ne ek vishesh prabandh ke tahat film dekhne ke baad kaha, ‘ab jabaki bihar chunaav najadik aa rahe hai isliye har kisi ko 'maanjhi' film dekhni chahie taaki vah jaan sake ki bihar kaa diene kisase bana hota he

 The popular Jisha massacre of Kerala is yet to be forgotten
 is maamle main police ne ek aisa khulaasa kiya tha ki use sunakar har koi hairaan rah gaya tha
 Actually, the accused Amirul Islam had become alive by burning in the fire of lust
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki wo darinda jaanwaron ke saath bhi kukarm karata tha
 Sensational massacre: The Jisha massacre in April 2016 shook the entire state of Kerala
 jisha kobalaatkaarake baad berahami ke saath katl kar diya gaya tha
 When the accused of this sensational murder came to the police, the policemen were stunned to know his condition
 jaanwaron ke saath sexpulice ko poochtacha main pataa chalaa ki wo kaatil na sirf bejubaanon ke saath sex karata tha, balki vahashipan kii had ko paar karte hue apni haivaaniyat mitaane ke baad un jaanwaron kii hatya bhi kar detaa tha
 Must Read: The ISIS militant porn video revealed to have sex with Gadhi reveals Rajpolis' amorousness after Amirul when a video was recovered from the accused's house during the investigation
 video main aaropee ek bakre ke saath kukarm kar rahaa tha
 It was recorded by another laborer
 police ko amirul ke mobile main kai porn clips bhi mili the
 Vashishipanpolis used to do with friends that the way the accused's misdeed with the goat was recorded by one of his companions, it was evident that his friends were also interested in such work
 shuruaati jaanch ke dauraan mili, us video ko dekhakar police ne ashanka jataai thi ki amirul islam or uske dost jaanwaron ke saath baari-baari secukarmakarte the
 On the other hand, ever since this revelation has been made about the accused, the people have become cautious
 jabaki pashupaalan karne vaale kai logon ne doctor ko bulaakar apane pashuon kii jaanch bhi karwaai he
 The police also conducted a medical examination of the goat with whom the accused had misbehaved at the Government Veterinary Hospital
 koun thi jisha29 varshiya jisha ernakulam ke government lau college kii chaatra thi
 On 28 April 2016, Jisha was murdered in her home
 vah apni maa ke saath vahaan rahaa karti thi
 Jisha's mother was a laborer
 uske pita unase alag rahaa karte the
 In this massacre, the police had previously suspected that there may be a neighbor or relative behind this murder
 yaa phir avaidh sambandhon kii kahani bhi ho sakati he
 But later the matter came to headlines when the reality came to light
 sonu, us din jab video main tumhen bhikhaari ke bhesh main gaate hue dekha to man khush tha ye dekhakar ki tum jaisaa great singer sadakon par apane chaahane waalon ke bich ga rahaa he
 Probably none of them would have ever heard your live concert
 thele par sabji bechney vaale ladke ne to jaise vahiin deraa jamaa liya tha
 But perhaps the real fans are those who fill you up in cassettes and listen to them day and night
 concert main to koi-koi hi ja paata he
 After that, you too must have felt that if someone does not have his popularity with anyone, he does not have the right identity, then people go unheeded
 haa tum is anubhav se vanchit rah jate agarsonurhakar hi gaate or log shaayad tumhaare gane sunne se zyada tumhaare autograph ke liye umad padate
 You will also be addicted to it
 videomen tumne kaha tha ki bhesh badalakar isliye gaaya kyonki tum logon ko un street singrs ke prati jaagruk karnaa chaahate the
 But what should i do with my mind in which after this step, many questions are arising simultaneously
 mere hisaab se jaagarukta failaana acchhee baat he or hamaare samaaj main bahut se muddon ke prati jaagarukta paidaa karne kii behad jarurat bhi he
 Sonu, my question to you is, did you really create this video to create awareness for those un-learned, God-gifted, melodious singers? Was it really your publicity stunt? Did you not do this just to stay in the news? If your answer is in 'no', then my list of questions gets longer
 jaise jin logon se tum yah ummid kar rahe ho ki ve apni vyastata se kuch samay nikaal kar un street singrs ko sunne main bitaayen
 Most of them may be actually fighting for their livelihood and running around
 or shaayad tumhaare is messej ko dekhne ke liye soshal media par active bhi nahin honge
 Bhaiya, a vegetable man, a factory worker or a housemaid, i don't think some of these people would have seen this video of you
 haalanki sadak par ga rahe kisi street singer ko sunne ke liye inamen se bahut se log rukate bhi honge
 But not by watching your video but probably because one of them will be singing a superhit song of yours
 sonu, tumhaara jawaab agar ‘haa’ main he, to mujhe tumse zyada shikaayat he
 Don't you know that you are Sonu Nigam? kya tum bhul gaye ho ki tum legendary singer sonu nigam ho jo 20 saal se mujh jaise karodon logon ke dilon par raaj kar rahe ho
 You are the Sonu Nigam who has kept Rafi Sahab alive in the true sense
 tum wo sonu nigam ho jisane hamen 'divaana tera', 'ab mujhe raat din', 'dil se', 'har ghadi' jaise evergreen gane die
 You are the Sonu Nigam who has done justice to every song sung in his career
 or yah sirf main nahin kah rahi, yah har wo shaks kahegaa jisane kabhi bhi tumhen suna ho
 So why did you do this when you were Vosonu Nigam? Why did you have to resort to this video for publicity? You will always be a fan, so why did you have to take the form of someone else to reach your loved ones? The idea of going among people by pretending to be a street singer was right

 It is not that from now onwards those singers will start getting work
 or aisa bhi nahin he ki video ko kuch lakh like milane se logon ke man main sadak par ga rahe kisi gayak ke prati samvednaa paidaa ho jaaegi
 Well, believe me, i am happy to see this video of you as a fan, but as a rational and aware citizen of the country, i am also missing something

 i used to teach her only, but she never understood me as a guru, for that i was a big brother - but a brother who can be loved, who can be bent on the basis of which dreams can be woven - and One who breaks them out of neglect! i used to teach, i taught very hard
 par vah kuch bhi nahin sikh paati thi! nity main usase poochta, 'pichhlaa sabak yaad kiya he?’ tab vah sir jhukaakar ek nirarthak-si muskuraahat lekar chup rah jaati thi
 Then i would ask again and again, rebuke, and say, 'such studies cannot take place
 ’ or puraane sabak ko duhraane bitha detaa tha
 She did not read at all then
 kitaab saamne rakhkar badi manansheeltaa se use dekhati rahati thi, un aankhon se jo badi-badi boondon se bhari hui hoti thim or kuch bhi nahin dekh sakati thim
 
 
 Then i used to say in a tone of affection (but a little bit of affection!), "okay, let's study further today
" kal donon sabak yaad kar lenaa!’ or vah padhati thi
 And the other day the same situation again! One day i was very angry
 tab uski ansu-bhari ankhen dekhakar maine jhunjhalaae swar main kaha, 'padhati-likhti to kuch ho nahin, or kuch kahata hoon to ro padati ho! hato kal se main nahin aauunga
 'I stood up
 tab vah deen swar main boli, 'mujhe fursat kahan milti he? ammaan saare din to pachison kaam bataati rahati hai?’guru kaise maan jaae! ammaan bhi ai
 He also asked them, "how much time does one get to read it?" main to padhai ke dar se kabhi kuch kahati bhi nahin! kyon, thik nahin padhati kya?’mujhe kahana sach hi chahie tha, par maine kaha, 'nahin, padhati to he, par thodi der or padhaa kare to-’ ve chali gayi
 Then i asked him again, 'why?' What would she say? There is a limit to how long dreams can be seen by putting the book in front of me! i said in a more harsh voice, "why, now?" "I will read carefully now?" Then i started teaching
 tab ek din aisa aayaa ki main use padhaane nahin gaya
 Not two days, not three days
 chauthe din maine uske pita ko patr likh diya ki main nahin padhaa sakoongaa
 He sent a check to my name the next day
 kahani samaapt ho gai
 But the other day his servant, a little boy, came to me and said, 'BBG asks, i will not come to teach?' i duckily said, 'who BBG?' "younger
 unhone bulaayaa he
 'I then asked,' Sheila? '"yes
 ’use shaayad pataa nahin tha ki padhai kaise samaapt ho chuki he
 i said, 'tell them, i can't come
 unke pita ne padhai band kar di he
 'he's gone
 mujhe yah vichaar nahin hua ki main kisi kaayarta se jhooth bolaa hoon
 i kept thinking that i had won! i lost in that victory
 yadi main use sach hi kahala detaa ki maine hi inkaar kiya he, tab shaayad vah apane ko anyaay kaa bhaagi samajhakar hi kuch santvanaa paati, maine uske liye bhi sthaan nahin choda or tab se uski ulahana bhari chaaya mere saath-saath aati he or roti si kahati he- jhuthe! jhuthe!main isse bachakar bhaagta hoon
 i have been running and still looking at the flowers, i am thinking, where do i run from these withered flowers? But why should i run? Sheela, i did not betray you
 apane ko ab tak avashya dhokhaa detaa aayaa hoon
 The lie i lied, he did not forget you, i forgot him
 par aaj main apni bhul janaa gaya hoon
 Today i give you trouble, your brother, who accepts your faith with gratitude, who forgets his shame and says that he lied to himself and not to you by lying
 yahi uskaa pratidaan he jo tumhen ab tak nahin mila, jo shaayad ab tumhen kabhi nahin mil saktaa, kintu jise yah aaj chuktaa kar chukaa he
 As long as the flowers were fresh, it did not look like how they are tied
 maine inhen apni kothri ke jangle se band diya tha, par unhen baandhane vaala feete kaa tukdaa nahin dikhta tha, kaale lohe ke sikhchon ke saath lage hue ye safed komal phool, ek bade amadhur satya kii yaad bade madhur dhang se dilaa dete the
 
 
 Today he sees lace
 uske aparivartt phande main phool suukh chuke hai, apana smarak bhar rah gaye hai or vivash-se latak rahe hai
 Reminding me of something - who knows! They are saying, lust is mortal, fades and then love and maintains the stability of life
 
 
 yaa shaayad isse ulataa! kah rahe hai, jab prem mar jaataa he, tab vaasana uske shav ko uthaae-uthaae phirti he or usase apane ko dhokhe main chhipaana chaahati he
 
 
 Saying, and reminding some, pointing to someone
 
 
 'ramya tati raavi’ kaa ek tat, jo or kaisaa bhi ho ramya nahin he
 a thick forest of small bushes and stumpy trees on the coast
 khinchi hui aah kii tarah garm or nistabdh raat
 a single star entangled in the dry branches of the trees above, the dry sighs of dead and dusty leaves below and in front
 
 
 ek bikharaa hua shav
 Both his hands are amputated
 ek pair kataa hua he, pet khul-sa gaya he or usamen se antadiyaan baahar giri pad rahi hai
 Tortured eyes, looking at the net of branches above, are looking at a star, and the mouth has a sagging pained smile
 
 
 use mare der ho gai
 The horrific explosion of which fell like a broken pillar of human existence, there were one or two spectators at that time, but when he died, there was no one to help him in solving the confusion of life
 ve gaye the saahayya praapt karne- ek ko vahiin chhodkar
 But it came to night and his waiting soul could not bear any more
 
 
 tab vah antim prahari foundne chalaa
 
 
 And when they found him, when they all reached there to pick him up and walk, he was lost
 The memory of his sorrow and pain, and the memory of his hope and action he had left leaving a perverted smile
 ve chaar-paanch jan us sharir ke paas khadey hai
 They are not crying, not shedding tears
 ve apane chirsanchit armaan baha rahe hai, kyonki unka uddeshy ek visphot kaa dhuaan banakar ud gaya he
 Slowly sifted out of the tangled web of thick forest branches, tortured but silently, leaving a full smile in the watery solitude when the last watchdog left him and his own conscience became the only watchdog There was a futile watch over the waterfall of that desperate desperation
 
 
 us behad main us fatty hui aankh ke andhepan ne kya dekha, yadi ham jaan pate
 
 
 Those four-five are standing near him
 qatari baandhe, saavdhaan mudra main, sir jhukaae hue
 With a feeling of respect, they all greet him with one hand and remain the same for a long time
 
 
 ve sab chup hai, is drishy ko puraa karne vaali bhairavi unke antstal main kahin mook swar main baj rahi he
 
 
 This is the funeral of that poet-hearted soldier, the last boom of that rebel's rebellion
 drishy feekaa pad jaataa he
 a dark white remains in the sky, only that body in a splash of blood
 
 
 uske donon ore do aakaar- ek stri or ek purush
 They are looking at each other, their eyes do not see the dead body, their heart does not feel that they are corrupting the tomb of some grand sanctity
 ve milte hai, banhon se ek-duusare ko gherkar bandhate hai, aalingan karte hai kisi daanvi bhukh se or usee shav ke aar-paar! phir-bhram! main dekh rahaa hoon jangle se latake hue sookhe hue naragis ke guchchhe ko or use ghere hue feete ke tukade ko
 Lies, deceit and manipulation are very easy for human beings, because God made humans his model and God is the biggest lie and deceit and deceit in our knowledge
 
 
 
 Otherwise, what is the reason for the picture i see? Can a human do so much in the face of so much despair and so much self-denial?

 Teacher's day is the biggest day of every teacher's life, but the reason behind not celebrating this day is given that teachers no longer feel safe and respected

 vahiin ection cameti skulon ko bhi aisa karnaa hoga
 That they should not celebrate Teachers' Day also

 After graduating from a reputed journalism institute in China, Ma's career path looked straightforward: she would enter a government media institute and cut her life at the desk by doing a government job there
 maa ne india today ko bataaya, ‘‘vah rasta kaaphi aasaan hota
 "but Ma did not like to walk on easy roads
" phir usne ek dukaan khol lee or naam rakhaa powerful
 It has been four years since she opened this shop with sex-related content, and the 25-year-old woman has done a much bigger job than setting up a new business during this time — she took the initiative to establish a national dialogue on the taboo subject Has done what was needed here for a long time

 a press release issued from AIIMS, the country's largest medical institute, states that efforts are being made to rescue an officer close to Health Minister JP Nadda and surrounded by corruption charges
 maamla 1982 batch ke iees adhikari vineet choudhary kaa he jin par ames ke bheetar gambhir gadabadiyon or karodon rupee ke bhrashtachar ke gambhir aarope hai
 The charge sheet against Vineet Chaudhary itself was then Health Minister
 harshavardhan ne hari jhandi di, lekin bijepi sarkaar ne ab tak us chargeshit par koi karrwai nahin kii he
 But now this press release of AIIMS itself has revealed that the Ministry of Health has asked MC Mishra, the director of AIIMS, to see if the allegations against Vineet Chaudhary deserve any action
 ames kii press release main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki santhaan ke maujuuda sivio ke mutabik vineet choudhary par lage aaropon main koi 'visilence angel' nahin he yani jaanch kii zarurat nahin he
 There has already been a lot of controversy over the charge sheet filed on Vineet Chaudhary, who was the deputy director in AIIMS
 asal main bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon ke taar vineet choudhary se judate hai
 These were disclosed by former CVO Sanjeev Chaturvedi who was later removed from the post of CVO of AIIMS
 enditivi india ne aapako khabar dikhaai thi ki saansad rahete nadda ne in maamalon kii jaanch rokane ke liye chitthee likhi or ames main apni pasand kaa nayaa sivio banaae jane ko kaha
 It has also come to light that action on Vineet Chaudhary is not being done due to JP Nadda not giving the green signal
 janhit abhiyaan naam kii enjio ne bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch rokane ke aarope lagaate hua court main apil kii, jiske baad nijee haisiyat par khud swasthya mantri nadda ko bhi hycourt kii ore se notice diya gaya
 The cvc's affidavit in the High Court has shown that due to non-approval of Nadda, investigation of corruption cases in AIIMS has stalled
 to sawaal uth rahaa he ki vineet choudhary ko bachaane kii koshish ke peeche kaa makasad kya ames main bhrashtachar ke tamaam maamalon par paradaa daalana he
 AIIMS in its press release has argued in favor of Vineet Chaudhary that he has not been handed over the charge sheet yet, hence the allegations in it are being reconsidered but the question is why this charge sheet has been put on hold for the last one year Kept
 tippaniyan The surprising thing is that in November 2013, the Health Ministry asked the Director of AIIMS to reconsider the charge sheet of Vineet Chaudhary and even then the current Director MC Mishra allowed the charge sheet to be filed against Chaudhary as correct
 
 uske baad hi kendriya harshavardhan is adhikari ke khilaaf chargeshit ko hari jhandi di
 Now the question is why the current Health Minister JP Nadda is stopping the action against Chaudhary? saaf he ki yah maamla sirf ames ke bheetar bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii lipa-potee kaa nahin he, balki nyaaypalika kii garima kaa bhi he, kyonki modi sarkaar ke cabinet mantri us afasar ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahe hai jo tamaam aaropon se ghira he or mantri ji ko khud is bare main court se notice diya ja chukaa he
 The case is of 1982 batch IAS officer Vineet Chaudhary who faces serious allegations of serious irregularities and corruption of crores of rupees within AIIMS
 saal bhar pehle hi vineet choudhary ke khilaaf chargeshit ko khud tab swasthya mantri rahe dow
 Harshvardhan gave the green signal, but the BJP government has not taken any action on that chargesheet so far
 lekin ab khud ames kii is press release se pataa chalaa he ki swasthya mantralay ne ames ke nideshak em si mishra se kaha he ki vah dekhen ki vineet choudhary par lage aarope kisi karrwai ke laayak hai yaa nahin
 The AIIMS press release also stated that according to the current CVO of the institute, there is no 'vigilance angle' in the allegations against Vineet Chaudhary, that is, there is no need for investigation
 ames main dipti diarector rah chuke vineet choudhary par daayar chargeshit ko lekar pehle hi kaaphi vivaad ho chukaa he
 In fact, many cases of corruption link up with Vineet Chaudhary
 jinka khulaasa purv sivio sanjeev chaturvedi ne kiya jinhen baad main ames ke sivio pad se hataa diya gaya
 NDTV India had shown you the news that Nadda, while an MP, wrote a letter to stop the investigation of these cases and asked for a new CVO of his choice in AIIMS
 ye baat bhi saamne ai he ki vineet choudhary par karrwai jepi nadda ke hari jhandi na dene kii vajah se hi nahin ho paa rahi he
 An NGO named Janhit Abhiyan appealed to the court accusing them of stopping the investigation into corruption cases, after which Health Minister Nadda himself was also given notice on behalf of the High Court on his personal status
 hycourt main die sivisi ke halafname se saaf hua he ki nadda kii anumati na milane kii vajah se ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch rukii hua he
 So the question is arising whether the motive behind the attempt to save Vineet Chaudhary is to cover up all the cases of corruption in AIIMS
 ames ne apni press release main vineet choudhary ke paksh main daleel di he ki unhen ab tak chargeshit thamai nahin gai, isliye isamen lage aaropon par punarvichaar kiya ja rahaa he lekin sawaal yah bhi he ki pichley ek saal se is chargeshit ko thande baste main kyon rakhaa gaya
 The comments hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki vineet choudhary kii chargeshit par punarvichaar ke liye november 2013 main bhi swasthya mantralay ne ames ke nideshak se kaha or tab bhi vartmaan nideshak em si mishra ne choudhary ke khilaaf aaropon ko sahi bataate hue chargeshit daayar karne kii anumati di
 Only after that the central Harshavardhan cleared the charge sheet against this officer
 ab sawaal ye he ki maujuuda swasthya mantri jepi nadda choudhary ke khilaaf karrwai ko kyon roke hue hai? It is clear that this case is not only about the corruption of the cases of corruption within AIIMS, but also of the dignity of the judiciary, because the cabinet minister of Modi government is trying to save the officer who is surrounded by all the allegations and The minister himself has been given notice in this regard from the court
 lekin ab khud ames kii is press release se pataa chalaa he ki swasthya mantralay ne ames ke nideshak em si mishra se kaha he ki vah dekhen ki vineet choudhary par lage aarope kisi karrwai ke laayak hai yaa nahin
 The AIIMS press release also stated that according to the current CVO of the institute, there is no 'vigilance angle' in the allegations against Vineet Chaudhary, that is, there is no need for investigation
 ames main dipti diarector rah chuke vineet choudhary par daayar chargeshit ko lekar pehle hi kaaphi vivaad ho chukaa he
 In fact, many cases of corruption link up with Vineet Chaudhary
 jinka khulaasa purv sivio sanjeev chaturvedi ne kiya jinhen baad main ames ke sivio pad se hataa diya gaya
 NDTV India had shown you the news that Nadda, while an MP, wrote a letter to stop the investigation of these cases and asked for a new CVO of his choice in AIIMS
 ye baat bhi saamne ai he ki vineet choudhary par karrwai jepi nadda ke hari jhandi na dene kii vajah se hi nahin ho paa rahi he
 An NGO named Janhit Abhiyan appealed to the court accusing them of stopping the investigation into corruption cases, after which Health Minister Nadda himself was also given notice on behalf of the High Court on his personal status
 hycourt main die sivisi ke halafname se saaf hua he ki nadda kii anumati na milane kii vajah se ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch rukii hua he
 So the question is arising whether the motive behind the attempt to save Vineet Chaudhary is to cover up all the cases of corruption in AIIMS
 ames ne apni press release main vineet choudhary ke paksh main daleel di he ki unhen ab tak chargeshit thamai nahin gai, isliye isamen lage aaropon par punarvichaar kiya ja rahaa he lekin sawaal yah bhi he ki pichley ek saal se is chargeshit ko thande baste main kyon rakhaa gaya
 The comments hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki vineet choudhary kii chargeshit par punarvichaar ke liye november 2013 main bhi swasthya mantralay ne ames ke nideshak se kaha or tab bhi vartmaan nideshak em si mishra ne choudhary ke khilaaf aaropon ko sahi bataate hue chargeshit daayar karne kii anumati di
 Only after that the central Harshavardhan cleared the charge sheet against this officer

 enditivi india ne aapako khabar dikhaai thi ki saansad rahete nadda ne in maamalon kii jaanch rokane ke liye chitthee likhi or ames main apni pasand kaa nayaa sivio banaae jane ko kaha
 It has also come to light that action on Vineet Chaudhary is not being done due to JP Nadda not giving the green signal
 janhit abhiyaan naam kii enjio ne bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch rokane ke aarope lagaate hua court main apil kii, jiske baad nijee haisiyat par khud swasthya mantri nadda ko bhi hycourt kii ore se notice diya gaya
 The cvc's affidavit in the High Court has shown that due to non-approval of Nadda, investigation of corruption cases in AIIMS has stalled
 to sawaal uth rahaa he ki vineet choudhary ko bachaane kii koshish ke peeche kaa makasad kya ames main bhrashtachar ke tamaam maamalon par paradaa daalana he
 AIIMS in its press release has argued in favor of Vineet Chaudhary that he has not been handed over the charge sheet yet, hence the allegations in it are being reconsidered but the question is why this charge sheet has been put on hold for the last one year Kept
 tippaniyan The surprising thing is that in November 2013, the Health Ministry asked the Director of AIIMS to reconsider the charge sheet of Vineet Chaudhary and even then the current Director MC Mishra allowed the charge sheet to be filed against Chaudhary as correct
 
 uske baad hi kendriya harshavardhan is adhikari ke khilaaf chargeshit ko hari jhandi di
 Now the question is why the current Health Minister JP Nadda is stopping the action against Chaudhary? saaf he ki yah maamla sirf ames ke bheetar bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii lipa-potee kaa nahin he, balki nyaaypalika kii garima kaa bhi he, kyonki modi sarkaar ke cabinet mantri us afasar ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahe hai jo tamaam aaropon se ghira he or mantri ji ko khud is bare main court se notice diya ja chukaa he
 An NGO named Janhit Abhiyan appealed to the court accusing them of stopping the investigation into corruption cases, after which Health Minister Nadda himself was also given notice on behalf of the High Court on his personal status
 hycourt main die sivisi ke halafname se saaf hua he ki nadda kii anumati na milane kii vajah se ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch rukii hua he
 So the question is arising whether the motive behind the attempt to save Vineet Chaudhary is to cover up all the cases of corruption in AIIMS
 ames ne apni press release main vineet choudhary ke paksh main daleel di he ki unhen ab tak chargeshit thamai nahin gai, isliye isamen lage aaropon par punarvichaar kiya ja rahaa he lekin sawaal yah bhi he ki pichley ek saal se is chargeshit ko thande baste main kyon rakhaa gaya
 The comments hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki vineet choudhary kii chargeshit par punarvichaar ke liye november 2013 main bhi swasthya mantralay ne ames ke nideshak se kaha or tab bhi vartmaan nideshak em si mishra ne choudhary ke khilaaf aaropon ko sahi bataate hue chargeshit daayar karne kii anumati di

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Questions are being raised about his credibility in the cbi's mutual fight
 isko lekar kendriya mantriaarake sinhane media ke saamne sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa
 In this, while answering the questions, he clarified that the steps taken by the government, given the seriousness of the case, were absolutely correct
 sibiai main number van or number do kii ladaai se mache ghamaasan par kendriya mantri aarake singh kaa kahana he, "vipakshi jo baaten kar rahaa hai un baton main koi dam nahin he
 Such things are being done deliberately
 sachai yah haisibiaika jo bhi bhrashtachar ke maamalon main kaam hota he, uskaa supervijanasivisike paas he
 The appointment of a CBI director is also done by a committee constituted under the chairmanship of the CVC
 sibiai main jo bhi sellection hota he vah sivisi hi karti he
 Even CBI appoints CVC and sends his name to the Prime Minister
 bhrashtachar ke maamalon main sabhi mantralayon main jo bhi karrwai honi hoti he vah sivisi kii salaah par hi hoti he
 CVC can also confiscate paper
 What are the facts here? In August, the No
 2 Special Director in the CBI wrote a letter alleging that he wanted to arrest a corrupt but the CBI Director stopped him
 diarector ne usase do karod ghoose lee thi
 Number two was accused of number one in August
 uske baad sivisi ne in aaropon ke kaagaj maange jo usko adhikaar tha
 CVC can also seize paper
 teen-chaar baar patr likhe lekin uske baad jab kaagaj nahin mili tab is bich main kya kiya gaya ? lekin jis par aarope lagaaya tha uske khilaaf exiaar darj kar di gai
 The suspension was recommended to be done
 The CVC did well to send both of them on leave so that a fair investigation could be conducted
 yah bilkul sahi he
 The government works on the recommendation of the CVC
 diarector par jo aarope tha uske jaanch honi thi
 They obstructed him, second he did indiscipline
 jo kaagaj maange gaye vah unhone nahin die
 If CVC wanted it, it could recommend to suspend them
 lekin aisa nahin kiya gaya or unako avkaash par bheja gaya
 If there was no immediate action, he would have gone with the paper and on the opposition's allegations, RK Singh says that the government has done exactly what has been done
 kanoonee taur se sivisi ne jo bhi opshan chunaa vah bahut hi mild opshan chunaa
 The CVC had many other options to suspend these, but this was not done
 yah sanstha ko bachaane ke liye kiya gaya he
 Number one says that number two has taken a bribe
 number tu kah rahaa he pehle se hi number van ne ghoose lee he
 On taking action at midnight, RK Singh says that if there was no immediate action, he would have gone with the paper
 rafel deal kaa koi maamla nahin tharahul gandhi kii rafel deal kii jaanch ko baadhit karne ke aarope par aarake singh kaa kahana he ki rafel deal kaa koi maamla nahin tha, yah to jhooth baat he
 Rahul Gandhi should have a little intelligence
 agar sivisi clin chit alok verma ko dete hai to waapas aakar vahi jaanch karenge
 If they do not give a clean chit and they are removed, then whichever new director will come, they will investigate under the chairmanship of the CVC committee
 sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavati kii relies ko lekar chal rahe vivaad se kendriya mantri smriti irani ne kinaaraa kar liya he
 Smriti said on the Padmavati controversy during the press conference in Ahmedabad, 'I have nothing to say in this context
 jis story or kahani ke bare main janaa nahin, dekha nahin he or padhaa nahin he, uske bare main kuch bhi nahin kahana chaahati hum
 'let me tell you that sometime back Smriti Irani said that there will be no problem regarding the release of Padmavati

 But now looking at the Gujarat elections, Smriti Irani has taken a U-turn on the film
 chittorgarh main hua padmavati kii relies kaa virodh, deepika ke dance se hai khafabta den ki chunaav ayog ne bhaajapa kii us maang ko khaarij kar diya he, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav ke chalate film padmavati kii relies par roak lagaai jaae yaa ise aage badhaaya jaae
 This demand was made by the state unit of BJP by writing a letter to the Election Commission
 tivi reports ke anusaar, chunaav ayog ne sanjay lila bhansaali kii is film par bain lagane yaa isaki relies ko aage badhaane se inkaar kiya he
 Election Commission refusal to ban Padmavati, BJP had demanded Gujarat State BJP Vice President IK Jadeja told the media that Rajput Samaj of 15-16 districts of Gujarat had demanded the party to ban the film
 unka tark tha ki film main aitihaasik tathyon ke saath chhedchhad kii gai he, jisase rajput samaaj kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchi he

 antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) ne apni doping rodhi samhita taiyaar kii he jo ek agast se lagu hogi
 In this, the rule of 'place of stay' of WADA has been revised after much deliberation after the objection of the BCCI
 isisi ne ek bayaan main kaha ki usne pratiyogita ke itar pareekshan se sambandhit ‘thaharne ke sthaan’ sambandhi niyam ko antim rup de diya he or sabhi sadsy cricket board is par sahamat ho gayi hai
 In this rule, two-step process will be adopted on the place of stay of the players and for testing the players will be divided into two pools which will be the International Registered Test Pool (IRTP) and National Player Pool (NPP)
 jo khilaadi pehle bhi doping ke maamle main fanse hai yaa jinke pratibandhit padaarth lene kii adhik ashanka he, unhen iartipi ke antargat rakhaa jayega
 Players included in the NPP will have to provide 'information related to the place of stay related to cricket' instead of their personal information
 enpipi main 88 antarrashtriya khilaadiyon (isisi ranking ke mutabik sheersh aath ekadivasiy tiimon main prayek ke 11 khilaadi) ko shaamil kiya jayega
 Most players will be placed in the NPP, where they will be tested at the time they are with the team i
e
 when they are playing, touring, training camp or touring with the team
 isaki jagah agar koi khilaadi vyaktigat taur par jayega to team prabandhan ko khilaadi kii jaankaree muhaiyaa karaani hogi
 According to wada's 'place of stay' rule, it is necessary to nominate 11 players to the international test pool, whose information for every three months of the hour will have to be disclosed to the ICC designated officer to conduct the test outside the competition
 sachin tendulkar sahit bharat ke chotii ke khilaadiyon ne apni nijee suraksha ko lekar chintaa jataai thi
 The Indian board had supported its players and objected to this rule
 bisisiai ne kaha tha ki yah desh ke samvidhan ke khilaaf he
 After lengthy discussions with member cricket boards, the ICC introduced the anti-doping rule during its general meeting in Singapore this month
 isisi ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari haaron lorgat ne kaha, ‘‘isisi kaa thaharne ke sthaan sambandhi niyam hamaare pratiyogita ke itar pareekshan kaarykram ko majboot karegaa kyonki ham cricket ko doping mukt sunishchit karne main jute hai
 Lorgat said, 'after a long process we have strict and practical rules that will support our policy of total intolerance in our great game
 ’wada ke mahanideshak david homen ne kaha, ‘‘vishwa doping rodhi agency naye ‘thaharne ke sthaan sambandhi’ niyam par raji hone ke liye antarrashtriya cricket parishad ko badhai detii he
 This is another sign from the governing body of cricket that it is serious about protecting the integrity of the game
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘‘iskaa matlab hua ki isisi kaa pratiyogita ke itar pareekshan kaarykram or majboot hoga or yah cricket ke liye acha kadam he
 The ICC signed the WADA Code in November 2006 to increase the credibility of cricket as a global sport and to fulfill the mandatory condition of participating in sports like Olympics

 centre sarkaar dwaara pichley saal maansik swasthya dekhbhaal adhinium-2017 adhishuchet kiya ja chukaa he, lekin dilli sarkaar ne abhi tak is bill ko adhishuchet karne ke liye koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 During this time, he asked the Kejriwal government why the process has not been started to implement this Act yet and why rules rules have not yet been formulated for regulation of de-addiction centers in Delhi? Vijendra Gupta said that on June 6 Will take up the matter in the assembly session starting from
 unhone dilli hoicourt ko saunpi gai rajya kanoonee seva adhikaran (dlese) kii report ko aadhaar banaate hue aarope lagaaya ki nasha mukti kendron main logon kaa shaareerik shoshan kiya ja rahaa he
 According to DSLSA, 750 people have been kept in these de-addiction centers against their wishes
 vijendra guptane kaha ki report ke mutabik 124 nasha mukti kendron main se 28 puri tarah se band pade hai
 Irregularities were found in the operation of these centers and most centers do not have adequate infrastructural facilities and security system or staff

 Ventilation and toilets are not usable
 ek-ek nasha mukti centre main paanch-paanch vyaktiyon ko gaiyr kanoonee rup se kamare main band karke rakhaa gaya
 BJP leader Gupta said that the Act passed by the Central Government guarantees to provide mental health care and services to people suffering from mental challenges living in de-addiction centers

 2017 main har ghante 4 logon kii maut hui jo bina helmet ke thehelmet na pahanane se marane waalon kii aadhi sankhya 4 rajyon se thisarkaar kii ore se laae gaye nae motor whical act ke tahat bade jurmaane kai logon ko raas nahin aa rahe hai
 On the one hand, while most states have curbed the increased rates of fine, Road, Traffic and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari justified the increase in fine
 unka maananaa he ki sadak ke niyamon kaa paalan na karne ke kaaran jo mautein ho rahi hai, badi hui daren un par lagaam lagane ke kaam aa sakati hai
 Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) of India Today assessed the data of road accidents in India in 2017 and found that the most two-wheeler drivers are killed in road accidents
 ab tak ke maujuud aankadon ke anusaar 2017 main bharat main lagbhag 48,746 dupahiyaa chaalkon ne sadak haadason main apni jaan ganvaai thi
 The data also revealed that 73 of these
 8 pratishat dupahiyaa chaalkon ne helmet nahin pahana tha
 This means that in India in 2017, 4 people died every hour on a two-wheeler on the road without a helmet
 sadak haadason main marane waalon main dupahiyaa chaalak pehle sthaan par aate hai
 In 2017, 48,746 two-wheelers died in a road accident, which is 33 percent of the number of deaths in a road accident
 dupahiyaa chaalkon ke baad aate hai car / jeep / taxi chaalak jahaan marane waalon kii sankhya 26,869 thi
 Then comes truck / tempo / tractor ones where the death toll was 17,158
 sadak haadason se marane waalon kii suchi main 9069 bas yatri the vahiin auto rickshaw main marane waalon kii sankhya 7167 thi
 In total, 35,975 two-wheelers who died in road accidents did not wear helmets
 inamen se 58 pratishat khud vaahan chalaa rahe the or 42 pratishat peeche baithe the
 Half of the deaths In its investigation in just four states, the DIU also found that half of the deaths due to not wearing helmets were from four states
 sabase zyaada mautein tamilnadu main dekhne ko milin, jahaan 6105 (17 pratishat) dupahiyaa savaaron ne helmet nahin pahana tha or haadase main maare gaye the
 Tamil Nadu is followed by Uttar Pradesh where the number of dead not wearing helmets was 4406
 is maamle main maharashtra tisare sthaan par tha jahaan helmet na pahanane vaale mritkon kii sankhya 4369 thi
 Madhya Pradesh comes in fourth place where the death toll was 3183
 meghalaya or mizoram aise do rajya the jahaan helmet na pahanane se marane vaala koi bhi nahin tha
 Tamil Nadu had the highest number of dead people not wearing helmets, but it should also be noted that the highest number of road accidents also occurred in this state
 iskaa matlab yah ki tamilnadu main har chaar dupahiyaa vaahan sambandhit sadak haadason main se ek hi vyakti maut kaa shikaar hua
 If the rate of deaths per 100 two-wheelers is calculated, then Jharkhand comes first
 jharkhand main dupahiyaa vaahan se jude 52 pratishat haadason main mautein darj kii gayi- matlab har 2 haadason main ek maut
 Rajasthan (40) comes after Jharkhand
 84%), punjab (40
 67%), Uttar Pradesh (38
 89%), maharashtra (36
 81%) and West Bengal (36
 27%) jahaan haadason main helmet na pahanane vaale mritkon kii dar sabase zyada thi
 Arunachal Pradesh (6
 45%), nagaland (6
 25%), Kerala (5
 55%), dilli (5
 41%), Tripura (4
 17%), sikkim (4
 17%) and Jammu Kashmir (1
 01%) aise rajya the jahaan yah dar 10 pratishat se bhi kam thi
 There were no people in Mizoram and Meghalaya who were killed for not wearing helmets
non helmet na pahanane vaale- 91 pratishat haadason main kam se kam chot to lagati hi he
 While the number of dead people not wearing helmets in the country is very high, the number of injured people is more than that
 DIU ne apni padtaal main paaya ki kul dupahiyaa vaahan haadason main 91 pratishat haadase aise the jahaan sawari prabhavit hui thi- matlab haadase se unki yaa to maut hui, yaa gambhir chotein ain yaa maamuli chotein ain
 Out of every 100 accidents in Tamil Nadu, 126 two-wheelers were least hurt
 tamilnadu ke baad aate hai maharashtra, rajasthan, pashchim bengal, himachal pradesh jharkhand or karnataka jahaan par har 100 main se ek dupahiyaa vaahan savaar, jisane helmet nahin pahana tha, prabhavit hua
 This diplomatic masterstroke of Prime Minister Modi (PM Modi), who is determined to resolve the Kashmir issue at the beginning of his second term
 samachar agency IANS ne anuchhed 370 par unke nirnay, jiskaa bahut-se logon ne swaagat kiya he, or kuch ne virodh kiya he, ke bare main unase kai sawaal puche
 When asked by the Prime Minister, an uncomfortable peace is being seen at the moment, so why do you think the people of Jammu and Kashmir will stand with you, then the Prime Minister responded with clarity in his style, "kashmir But look at the list of people who opposed the decision taken - unusual vested selfish groups, political families, who sympathize with terror and some opposition's friends - but Bha Apart from their political affiliations, people of Rat have supported the steps taken regarding Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh

 "pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa spasht vichaar he ki ghati main jivan saamaanya ho jayega
 He said that this provision has actually done a loss to India, and it has benefited a handful of families and some separatists
 PM ne kaha, "is baat se ab har koi spasht rup se waakif he ki anuchhed 370 or 35e ne kis tarah jammu evam kashmir or ladakh ko puri tarah alag-thalag kar rakhaa tha
 
 
 This situation of seven decades did not fulfill the aspirations of the people

 "it is clear that the Prime Minister was adamant on resolving the scandal which was considered to be unfortunate, he studied the issue in detail

 After the death of a bike rider due to a pit in Delhi's Vasant Kunj area, the BJP is attacking Delhi's AAP government, while it has put its ruling MCD on the task of filling the pit
 emsidi ne daawa kiya he ki agle 15 din main vah apane adhikaar kshetra main aane vaali sadakon ko gaddha free kar degi
 According to the information, the BJP has also prepared a complete action plan for this
 emsidi par hameshaasadakon kii kharaab haalat ko lekar aarope lagate rahe hai
 So before this time too, the cannon of charges turned towards him, the MCD has started filling the pit
 dakshini emsidi main sadan ke netaa subhash aryaa bataate hai, 'har ward ke liye ek team banaai gai he, jo sadakon par gaddhon ko bharne kaa kaam karegi
 There will be no pit on the road
 'asthai taur par bhare jaaenge gaddheemsidi ne philhal muram or bajri se gaddhon ko asthai taur par bharne kii yojana banaai he
 The reasoning behind this is that coal does not mix easily during the rainy season, so the craters do not become dangerous and dangerous, so they will be filled immediately
 aryaa ke mutabik, emsidi ke paas choti sadaken hai or colony ke andar kii sadaken hai
 Engineers have been deployed to monitor these roads, while the Delhi government has large traffic roads with Delhi government failing to fill the pit

 Party workers are upset that people are ready to donate, but as soon as it comes to the public (release on the website) the names of the donors, people back off because who can afford Chief Minister Hooda's displeasure

 kuch aisa hi hua he pichley dinon pathakon ke bich aayi ashish kaul kii kitaab 'didda -da variyar queen of kashmir' ke saath
 Ashish, after playing a successful innings in the corporate world, is making a mark in the writing world too
 kashmir main faile aatankwaad kii jad or uske halaaton ko ujagar karne vaali kitaab 'rifuji camp' se unhone kaaphi charchaa batori
 This book is one of the most popular books written in Hindi on Kashmir and was acclaimed by a large readership from India to Pakistan
 'didda -da variyar queen of kashmir' unki aitihaasik vishay par likhi kitaab he, or 'rifuji camp' se alag yah pehle angreji main chhapi he
 Through this book, she has given Indian society as Queen Didda of Kashmir satisfied with the number of female role models that can be counted on her fingers, including Rani Laxmi Bai, who has made her own rules in accordance with the rules of her era
 Not only did he challenge the male patriarchal society but it also showed him to be cheated by chance
 yah kitaab didda ke jivan ke anek pahaluon ko kuch is kadar ujagar karti he ki pathaq khud se ye sawaal karata jaan padataa he ki aisi karishmai mahila ke haath shashan kii bagdor rahi to uskaa zikr itnaa dhundhala kyon rahaa ki kisi ko dikhaa hi nahin? nishchay hi pitrusattatmak is samaaj ne us virangana se maukey-maukey par mili haar ke badale main uski veerta kii gaatha hi itihaas se is kadar ojhal kar di ki wo sirf ek chudail rani hi ban kar kahin gum ho gayi
 Born in the Lohar Dynasty (now part of Haryana, Punjab, Poonch Rajori), a beautiful little girl is abandoned by her parents only because she was born crippled
 naukaraani kaa doodh pikar pali badi wo ladki apane aapng hone ko baadha na maanate hue yuddh kala main paarangat hui or tarah-tarah ke khelon main nipunata hasil kii
 One day when the king of Kashmir, Kshemagupta, saw the beautiful princess Didda during the shooting, at first glance, he was heartbroken
 raja kshemgupta ek bhala raja tha
 Even after finding out that Didda is lame, she marries him and Didda's fate is reversed in a way
 use pati kaa pyaar, maan-sammaan, putr ratna to mila hi, saath hi usne kshemgupta ke raaj kaaj main bhi bhagidaari nibhaani shuru kar di
 In honor of this partnership, the coin was issued in his wife's name
 vah aisa pehla raja bana jo apni patni ke naam se janaa gaya
 According to the description mentioned in 'didda-the Warrior Queen of Kashmir', when everything was going well, Khemagupta died during the shooting, one day, Didda's life came to an end
 is doraahe main jahaan ek taraf pati kii mrityu kaa dukh or sati ho jane kii parampara thi, to duusari taraf ek nanhe rajkumaar ke raaj-paath sanbhaalane laayak hone tak uske paalan-poshan or shiksha-diksha kii zimmedaari nibhaane vaali maan kaa daayitv
 During this duel, the pledge to give the dying king in the safe hands of the kingdom gives him the power that suddenly he refuses to become Sati
 'didda -da variyar queen of kashmir' main yah padhanaa dilachasp he ki kaise samay-samay par didda ne purush sattatmak samaaj ke bane-banaae niyam tode or apane khud ke niyam banaae
 The result was that the masculine mentality called Didda even a witch
 purush samaaj ko yah samajhnaa mushkil tha ki aakhir bina mayavi shaktiyon ke koi viklang ladki chaar dashak se bhi adhik samay tak samooche kashmir or dharti ke ek bade hisse par rajya kaise kar sakati thi?didda kii kahani ek aisi nayika ke jivan yatra kii kahani he jo ek anchaahi aapng kanya se shuru hokar, kashmir ke raja kii bivi banane or phir vidhwaa hone ke baad rajya sanbhaalane, kai yuddh karne or yuddh jeetne ke liye gorilla takanic ijad karne ke prasang se hoti hui us dilachasp mode se guzarati he, jahaan sambhawatah vishwa kii pratham commando sena, ekangi sena ke banane kaa ghatnakram varnit he
 This story not only tells the saga of courage, restraint, duty and patriotism, but also tells the saga of disorder and malice of the human mind
 yah yon hi nahin he ki didda jis bete ke liye jivit rahi usee ke dwaara apane mahal se nikaal di gai
 Despite this, he continued to engage with the public, built temples, trade with all of Asia and devised a strategy to protect the borders of unbroken India extending to Iran
 is kitaab ke tamaam sandarbh aapako itihaas ke us daur main le jate hai, jisaki baat aksar hoti hi nahin he
 In the midst of all this, there is mention of the dreaded Mahmud Ghazni, whose entire country knows the history of the demolition after entering India, but this book, referring to Mahmud Ghazni, talks about a context from which Most people are ignorant
 bharat par akraman karne vaale sarvaadhik khoonkhwaar aakrantaon main se ek, somnath mandir ko luutane vaale or kai shaharon ko tahas-nahas karne vaale gazani ko didda ne apni ranneeti se ek nahin do-do baar bharat main ghusane se roka or yuddh main haraaya, jiske baad usne rasta badla or gujarat ke raste bharat main pravesh kiya
 After several battle episodes one after the other, it is interesting how Didda chooses his heir
 ek shashakt rajya ek kaabil shaasha ke haathon main jaae ye sunishchit karne ke liye bhi didda kaa apana hi tarika tha
 He held a unique competition among his nephews that the one who would bring the most apples into his hands at one time would hand him the reins of power
 saafe he ki rajya ke bhavi raja ke parakram or buddhi ke sahi santulan ko aankane kaa yah didda kaa apana tarika tha
 This heroic saga of Rani Didda seems fictitious, but Ashish Kaul as the narrator describes it as the hero of a real hero
 vah gaatha jise unhone bachapan main suna tha, or jise unhone kareeb chah saal ke ratjagon ke baad likhaa
 According to him, after King Vikramaditya, no one can claim to know the full story of that phenomenal queen who ruled an unbroken empire by adding land and rulers, but he wants to say only one sentence about this book
 This is the story of every combative woman through Didda, Didda is an inspiration for women around the world
 ''didda -da variyar queen of kashmir' ko padhate vakt aisa lagata he ki lekhak ne uplabdh jaankariyon ke tukdon ko jodakar shaury bahadur virangana rani didda kii kahani logon tak pahunchane kii ek koshish kii he
 To tell the truth, the story of Rani Didda becomes even more contemporary in today's era, when many women are not only sitting on high positions after their struggles, having success between power and fame, but by their ability Surprising the world
 thik yahi to aaj se 1200 saal pehle rani didda ne kiya tha
 This book is written by another extraordinary female Para Olympic champion and Padmashree Deepa Malik
 deepa kahati hai ki ‘ye bhartiya itihaas dwaara bhula di gayi ek aisi anuthi marmasparshi bhartiya mahila kii kahani he, jisko logon tak pahunchane ke liye lekhak ne badi khubsuurati se shabdon ke din banaakar kahani kii maala main piroyaa he
 This story breaks not only the story but also many global beliefs related to women and teaches the world not only to respect women's abilities
 balki, unki sweekaaryata bhi badhaati he

 naagarik uddyan mantri ashok gajpati raju ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki air india kii balance shit itani kharaab he ki yadi sarkaar ise bechnaa bhi chahen to bhi koi ise nahin kharidega
 He also denied the possibility of its disinvestment
 ullekhneey he ki air india par takreeban 50 hajaar karod rupee kaa rin bhaar he
 Along with this, he also added that taxpayer's money cannot be spent on it like this forever
 darasal air india baari-bharkam karj ke boj tale dabe hone ke baavjood maujuuda vipareet bijness paristhitiyon se bhi jujh rahi he
 To correct the condition of Air India formed since the mutual merger of Air India and Indian Airlines in 2007, the UPA government gave a bailout package of 30 thousand crores
 raju ne haalanki yah bhi kaha ki anyon kii tarah vah isko kosna nahin chaahate lekin air india ko apane lakshyon ko hasil karne ke liye ekajute hokar kaam karnaa hoga
 He said, "this is a great airline
 main air india ko pasand karata hum lekin hameshaa ke liye karadaataaon kaa paisa is par kharch kiye jane kaa main bharosa nahin de saktaa
 " yadhyapi pehle kii tulana main isaki vittiya halaat thodaa sudhari he or gharelu vimaanan bazaar kii badhati sambhaavnaaon ke bich air india kii vistaar kii disha main aage badhate hue agle chaar varshon main 100 aircraft kharidne kii yojana he
 Raju says on this issue, 'I feel that there is a need for solidarity in the Air India team
 jahaan ve ek team kii tarah kaam karte hai, vahaan unka pradarshan behtareen rahaa he or jahaan ve team kii tarah kaam nahin karte to ve vibhinn dishaao main alag-thalag dikhte hai
 But no one can turn the clock needles backward

 unhone iske vinievesh kii sambhaavnaaon se bhi inkaar kiya
 It is worth mentioning that Air India has a debt burden of about 50 thousand crores
 iske saath hi unhone yah bhi joda ki karadaataaon ke dhan ko is tarah hameshaa ke liye is par nahin kharch kiya ja saktaa
 In fact, Air India is also struggling with the current adverse business conditions despite being burdened with heavy debt
 2007 main air india or indian airlines ke aapasi vilay ke baad se bane air india kii haalat ko durust karne ke liye upie sarkaar ne 30 hajaar karod kaa belout package diya tha
 Raju, however, also said that like others he does not want to curse it but Air India will have to work unitedly to achieve its goals
 unhone kaha, " yah behad shandaar airline he
 i like Air India but i cannot assure that taxpayers' money is spent on it forever
 " However, its financial situation has improved a bit compared to the past and Air India plans to buy 100 aircraft in the next four years, moving towards expansion amidst the growing prospects of the domestic aviation market
 is masale par raju kaa kahana he, ' main mahasoos karata hum ki air india team main ekajutata kii darkaar he
 Where they work as a team, they have performed well and where they do not work as a team, they look isolated in different directions
 lekin koi bhi ghadi kii suyiyon ko peeche nahin ghuma saktaa
 The sooner they understand this, the better

 Gyandeep Mangal says that smoking is estimated to cause 90 percent of lung cancers, 30 percent of other types of cancer, 80 percent of bronchitis, infasima and 20 to 25 percent of fatal heart diseases
 unhone kaha ki bharat main jitani teji se dhumrapaan ke rup main tambaakoo kaa seven kiya ja rahaa he, usase andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki har saal tambaakoo seven ke kaaran kitni jaane khatre main hai
 There is more harm to drinking tobacco than chewing it
 tambaakoo main carbon monooxide or tar jaise jahrile padaarth paae jate hai or yah sabhi padaarth swasth ke liye jaanaleva hai
 Both smoking and smokeless (chewing tobacco) are equally life-threatening
 log dhumrapaan yaa to style yaa phir states ke liye shuru karte hai, par tambaakoo aapke fefdon par hamalaa karata he or hriday or rakt dhamniyon main oxigen ke avaagaman main baadha daalata he
 Not only this, tobacco can also weaken fertility, cancer also gives direct invitation to life threatening disease
 4000 rasayanon main se tambaakoo main 70 iearasi samooh 1 cancerajan hai, jo munh ke cancer, fefdon ke cancer, grasanalee, agnashay, mutrashay aadi main cancer ko badhaava de sakate hai
 Never be misled by the brand or type of tobacco you consume that it cannot harm you
 vishwaas kiijie, tambaakoo kaa seven har haal main aapako nuksaan pahunchaata he
 According to Dr
 Shilpi Sharma, Consultant (surgical Oncologist) at Naraina Superspeciality Hospital, "whether you consume tobacco as smoke or chew it, it is dangerous for your health in both the forms
 tambaakoo main maujuud nicotine kii vajah se aapako tambaakoo ke seven kii lat lag sakati he, jiskaa asar aapke saare sharir par padataa he
 "he said that tobacco smoke contains many thousands of different chemicals, many of which can cause disease in people
 dhumrapaan karne or tambaakoo chabane se chronic obstructive pulmonary beemaari, fefdon kaa cancer, hriday rog or stroke ityadi jaisi kai chronic bimaariyaan ho jaati hai
 According to the WHO, COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide and both direct and indirect forms of smoking may be responsible for 20 percent of deaths due to heart disease
 yadi aaj aap tambaakoo chhodana chaahate hai to nicotine chuingam, paches, spray, inheler jaise padaarthon kaa upyog doctor kii dekharekh main le sakate hai
 There are some helpline numbers that help you get rid of it

 chhattisgarh ke bastar main naksaliyon ne nayaa gorakhdhandha shuru kiya he
 They are associating with contractors and setting their vehicles on fire
 khaastaur par sadak nirmaan main lage vaahanon or mashiinon ko
 Apart from this, buses and other vehicles providing passenger services are also burnt
 iske baad vaahan maalik jaale hue apane puraane vaahanon ke evaj main insurance companiyon se kshatipurti or sarkaar se muaavja vasuulate hai
 The alliance of Naxalites and contractors is underway to burn Dodgers, dumpers, trucks, bulldozers, machines, buses and other vehicles in the Naxal-affected areas of the state by the Naxals
 maamle ke khulaase ke baad police ne naksaliyon or thekedaaron kii gathjod ko sabak sikhaane kaa faisla kiya he
 Special purpose of arson: The incidents of arson in jungles are being carried out with special motive
 jangal main jalte vaahanon ko dekh kar yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki naksaliyon ne sarkaar ke khilaaf baghawat kaa elaan kar aagjanee kii ghatana ko anjaam diya, lekin sachai ye nahin he
 In fact, most cases of arson are getting the vehicle owners executed by paying a nominal amount to the Naxalites
 insurance clem kar companiyon se kshatipurtibastar ke jyadatar hisson main sadak nirmaan, bhawan or duusare vikaas kaary ho rahe hai
 Many construction agencies and contractors are doing this work
 nirmaan kaary main kai mashine, trek, doser, danpar se lekar yatri vaahanon tak kaa upyog ho rahaa he
 But the vehicles being used are not new but years old
 kaamkaaj ke dauraan in vaahanon conkliyon semilakar aag ke hawaale kar diya jaataa he
 Then the insurance claims of burnt vehicles are charged to the companies and compensation from the state government
 kai ndehjanak maamalon ko lekar police ne aise thekedaaron kaa byora taiyaar kiya he, jo naksaliyon se santhganth kar vaahan jalaane ke gorakh dhandhe ko anjaam de rahe hai
 According to IG Bastar range Vivekananda Sinha, this game has been going on for a long time
 unke mutabik jin ilaakon main naksali thekedaaron kii puraani gadiyon ko aag ke hawaale kar rahe hai, uske chand kadamon par dur thekedaaron kii nai gaadiyaan surakshit rahati hai
 It is clear that Naxalites are deliberately setting fire to trains
 unhone kaha ki aise kai maamle saamne aae, jisame nirmaan kaary main lagi nai mashine or gaadiyaan puri tarah se surakshit raheen, jabaki usee ke kareeb khadi puraani gaadiyaan itani buree tarah se se jalaai gai ki uske sabhi parts raakh main tabdeel ho gaye
 Now the police will teach a lesson, said that there are instructions to keep vehicles and machines connected with construction work in all the police stations and premises of Bastar
 iske evaj main koi shulk nahin liya jaataa
 Whereas the responsibility of complete safety of the vehicles is borne by the police
 iske baavjood thekedaar yahaan apane vaahan nahin rakhte
 He said that now the police will teach such contractors a lesson through insurance companies

 How much reporting is there in Assam in Hindi media? Are your correspondents covering the issue of citizenship for the month or year since the newspapers you wake up every morning? It is obvious that the political level of the readers of Hindi state rises and falls from the crowd and the commotion
 main baaki pradeshon kaa nahin jaanata
 Maybe there is the same situation
 assam jaisaa rajya itani badi maanvi traasadee se guzar rahaa he lekin kahin koi gambhirtha or nirantarata ke saath reporting nahin he
 Opinions made in a factory have been shared among all
 morrkhtaa kaa alam yah he ki manoj tiwari dilli main bayaan dete hai ki yahaan bhi neshnal register kii ginati ho
 He is sowing the seeds of politics that was sown in Assam
 jisase nikalne kii chatapataahat main vahaan kaa hindu or musalmaan donon aakraant he
 Both want to stem from the created political image of Bangladeshi and outsiders
 nateeja sab neshnal register centre ke baahar line main lag gaye or us traasadee ke kanware belt par chadh gaye jise bijepi ke hi netaa bekaar bataa rahe hai
 All this politics is being done on the strength of ignorance of Hindi states
 kyon chuppi he upi or bihar main? kyonki jaankaree nahin he
 There is no diversity in information

 There is a guide book named after the book
 naukari ke naam par sarkaron kaa inase dhokhaa he
 As a result, whatever they know from the guide book and their Hindi newspapers and channels, they know only yes or no given about politics

 jab desh ghor mandi se guzar rahaa tab news channel kaa ankar parmaanu hamale ke usase bachane or kitaab padhane jaisi raay de rahaa hota he
 If the youth of Hindi states do not understand this politics of constantly shifting from the problem, then they will not be worth anything
