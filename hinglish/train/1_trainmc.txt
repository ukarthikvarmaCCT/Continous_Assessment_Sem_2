 ) The Congress suffered a major setback on Thursday when Ashish Kulkarni, an alleged close to Rahul Gandhi and a member of the party's war room, resigned
 ashish kulkarni ke istife se pareshaan congress bhale hi puch rahi ho ki, "koun hai ashish kulkarni?"
 But, this question is its answer, the importance of that person only tells the question that if he was in the Congress as 'who is' then why is he giving clarification, why is there so much uproar
 ashish kulkarni ho sakate hai congress ke vibhishanaashish kulkarni congress kaa koi aam kaaryakarta nahin tha
 He used to work in the War Room 15 GRG of Congress

 Congress has time to think on this
 rahul ko ashish kii chitthee ekant main baithkar padhane or sochane kaa vakt he

 isse pehle 2016 membhay chautaalacort ko bina bataae or bina ijaajat liye rio olympic main bhaag lene chale gaye the
 During that time not only the CBI rejected Abhay's bail and sent him to jail, but the court was also very angry when Abhay Chautala went to Rio
 uske baad die apane aadesh main court ne saaf kiya tha ki abhaya chautaala desh se baahar jane se pehle har haal main court se ijaajat lenge or agar unhone iskaa paalan nahin kiya to unhen kadi sajaa ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 Now it has to be seen whether he gets permission from the court to go to Pakistan
 kyonki court ko apana faisla bhi 15 march ko sunaanaa he or abhaya chautaala ko pakistan bhi 15 march ko hi janaa he

 2007 main dilli kaa master plan 2021 bana, lekin 2012 main bhi tay nahin ho paa rahaa he ki plan main kya rahegaa or kya nahin
 Committees formed to review the master plan have now recommended several changes
 sabase ahm sifarish ye he ki dilli main oonchi imaaraton kii koi khaas zarurat nahin he
 However, the minister of the department does not agree with this
 kendriya shahari vikaas mantri ne kah diya he ki oonchi imaaraten hi dilli kii jaruraton ko puraa kar sakati hai
 The Review Committee has also recommended that more construction should be allowed on larger plots
 or chote platon ko kam nirmaan kii anumati deni chahie
 The master plan regarding FAR states exactly the opposite

 This recommendation of the committee can be a relief for traders
 cameti ne kaha he ki didie kii sabhi sadakon par mixd land yuj kii ijaajat de di jaae
 On the issue of form house also, two committees have made separate recommendations to each other

 unhone haalanki ummid jataai ki raina jald hi vaapasi karegaa
 Coach Sharma, who taught the game to the left-handed batsman Raina, who was praised in the book Wisden, which is called the Bible of Cricket, said in a conversation with Bhasha that Raina is definitely very talented but lack of consistency in performance The biggest obstacle is their path
 unhone kaha ki test team main apana sthaan pakkaa karne ke liye lagaataar bade score bananaa jaruri he or durbhaagya se raina aisa nahin kar sake hai
 Perhaps that is why he could not win the trust of the selectors as a Test cricketer
 raina ko ranjai trophy muqablon main bade score banane honge

 The comments unhone kaha ki aaj ke yug main kisi bhi khilaadi ko test, ekadivasiy tathaa tii-20 praaroop main dhaalnaa bahut jaruri he
 In such a situation, maintaining consistency in performance has become extremely challenging
 sharma ne kaha ki raina england ke khilaaf test shrunkhlaa ke liye bhartiya team main nahin chune jane se aahat jarur hai lekin unhen vishwaas he ki unka shishy ranjai muqablon main behtareen pradarshan karke team main waapas jagah bana legaa
 He said that if Raina comes to Lucknow soon, he will give him some 'gurmantra' to confirm his place in the Test team

 Adorned with Padma Bhushan, senior social activist Anna Hazare accused the Modi government of the Center of undermining democracy and said that 'this is just a government of assurances
 ' do divasiy janajagran yatra par somvaar ko lakhanu aae anna ne kaha ki desh main 26 janvari, 1950 se loktantr aa gaya, gore angrej desh se chale gaye, lekin 'kaale angrej' abhi bhi hai
 Here the leaders, ministers and officials are the servants of the public, but now all the servants have become owners
 paara kshetra ke paara sadruna sthit manyavar kanshiram shahari awaas colony main yojit jansabha main anna ne kaha ki loktantr sangharsh se majboot hota he
 But the Narendra Modi government has weakened democracy
 is sarkaar kaa dhyaan kaam karne se zyada virodhiyon ko dabaane par he
 He said that the law of appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta has been passed only in 2013, but even after five years it has not been implemented
 nai sarkaar ai to thodi ummid jaagi, lekin itane lambey samay tak kanoon ko latakaae rakhane kii vajah se modi sarkaar kii manshaa par puure desh ko shaq paidaa hone laga he
 The government wants to amend its provisions and end its entire purpose
 anna ne kaha ki chunavi pranali main sudhaar ke bina na to raajnneetik bhrashtachar pe lagaam lag sakegi or na hi janhit main kaary hoga, kyonki samvidhan main paksh or party na honen ke baavjood chunavi khami ke kaaran hi janata kii sarkaar banane ke bajaay dal kii sarkaar banati he, isiilie sarkarein janhit ke bajaay dalhit main kaam karti hai
 Anna said that if democracy is to be liberated, then the photo of the candidate on the evm-ballot should be made an election symbol, which will not only close the auction of election marks, but will also force the people to remain in public even after winning the election, because In the future, he will get votes only by identifying his face, this will curb political corruption
 tippaniyan He said that giving Right to Reject power to NOTA and counting of votes should be done with Totalizer Machine, so that democracy can be made effective
 anna hajaare ne kaha, "hamaare desh main sarkaar girane se darati he
 Not afraid of agitation
 aap sabhi logon main andar giraane kii shakti he
 " anna ne kaha ki lokapal, kisaan samasya or chunaav sudhaar ke liye dilli main 23 march se satyagrah karenge
 This time our movement will not end with assurance
 isse pehle anna subah hawaondde par pahunche
 Where he was welcomed by hundreds of supporters
 phir hawaondde se sadruna lekar kaaryaktoon ne dupahiyaa vaahan par tirangaa yatra nikaali
 In a public meeting held at Manyavar Kanshiram Urban Housing Colony in Para Sadrauna in the Para region, Anna said that democracy is strengthened by struggle
 lekin narendra modi sarkaar ne loktantr ko kamjor kiya he
 The focus of this government is to suppress opponents more than work
 unhone kaha ki lokapal or lokayukta kii niyukt kaa kanoon 2013 main hi paarit ho chukaa he, lekin paanch saal biit jane ke baad bhi is par amal nahin kiya gaya he
 There will be some hope when the new government comes, but due to the hanging of the law for so long, the whole country is starting to doubt the intention of the Modi government
 sarkaar iske praavdhaanon main sanshodhan karke uske puure uddeshy ko hi khatm kar dena chaahati he
 Anna said that without reforming the electoral system neither political corruption nor public interest will work, because despite the lack of favor and party in the constitution, due to electoral flaws, the government of the party instead of forming the government of the people This is why governments work in Dalit rather than public interest
 anna ne kaha ki loktantr ko mukt karana he to iviem-mataptr par pratyaashee kii photo ko hi chunaav chinh banaaya jaae, jisase na sirf chunaav chinhon kii nilaamee band hogi, balki pratyaashee chunaav jeetne ke baad bhi janata ke bich rahanen ko baadhya hoga, kyonki aage bhi vot use apane chehre ko pahchaan karaane se hi milegaa, isse raajnneetik bhrashtachar par lagaam lagegaa
 The comments unhone kaha ki nota ko rhite tu riject kii power dene or voton kii ginati totlizer mashin se ginati ho, jisase loktantr ko prabhavi banaaya ja sake
 Anna Hazare said, “the government in our country is afraid of falling
 andolan se nahin darati
 All of you people have the power to drop inside
 " Anna said that Lokpal, farmers will do Satyagraha in Delhi for the problem and electoral reforms from 23 March
 is baar to hamaara andolan aashwaasan se khatm nahin hoga
 Earlier in the morning, Anna arrived at the airport
 jahaan saikadon samarthakon ne unka swaagat kiya
 Then, after taking Sadrauna from the airport, the workers took out the tricolor on a two-wheeler

 unhone kaha ki aaj shaam tak yah saaf ho jayega ki aaj ham itihaas se takaraate hai yaa ek nayaa itihaas banaate hai
 On the Lokpal Bill in Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley said that a weak Lokpal Bill should not be formed
 sadan main jo kamjor bill pesh kiya gaya he uske virodh main arun jetali ne kaha ki agar sarkaar chaahe to sadan ke sadasyon kii raay maanate hue is bill main sudhaar kare taaki yah bill sadan se waapas na jaae
 Jaitley said that public sentiments should be taken care of but nothing like this is visible in this bill

 He said that the public will never forgive those who want to make weak laws
 desh majboot bill chahta he isliye yah hamsab ke liye bhi ek pariksha kii ghadi he
 Jaitley said in the House that this is a test for those who give lectures or want to pass it
 jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar kii ranneeti yah thi ki ek khokhla lokapal kanoon bana do or use sanvaidhanik darja de do
 He said that the country does not need this kind of Lokpal
 jetali ne kaha ki ham sanvaidhanik sanstha chaahate hai lekin yah bhi chaahate hai ki rajyon par yah nahin thopa jaae
 Jaitley said that my protest has some basic grounds
 pehla virodh lokapal kii niyukti prakriya ko lekar he evam doosraa virodh isaki jaanch prakriya ko lekar he
 If the government has a majority in the appointment process, then it is pertinent to raise questions and the government will control the investigation agencies which is not acceptable to us
 unhone kaha ki sibiai ko nishpaksh banaaya jaae
 There should also be a Lokpal in the selection of its director
 jetali ne kaha ki maine tivi par suna koi kah rahaa tha ki ‘sarkaar criminal kanoon bana rahi he ki jalebi bana rahi he’
 
 
 
 jetali ne kaha ki lokapal kanoon ko lekar kisi ke liye koi pratishtha kaa prashn nahin hona chahie

 Chief reporter Piyush Babelle from Whistle Blower and BJP MP Kirit Somaiya, who exposed Yadav Singh scams three years ago, discussed the matter and the entire Noida land scam: Today, Yadav Singh has been tightened by income tax
 aapako lagata he ki aapaki mehnat rang laai?ek saamaajik kaaryakarta ke naate meraa kaam kisi mudde ko saarvajanik karnaa he
 After that, the government, police and the court take action on it
 bhrashtachari pakade jaaen, isse acchhee baat kya ho sakati he
 But did you become silent after the revelations in 2011? Any special reason? What is the point of silence in this? i did that when the party entrusted me with the work of Uttar Pradesh
 uske baad main rajasthan or phir maharashtra kii jimmedaari nibhaane main jute gaya
 By the way, i had sent all these papers to Chief Minister Akhilesh only then
 karrwai karnaa unka kaam he
 In 2011 November you sold Yadav Singh and Mayawati's brother Anand Kumar's Anonymous companies in 2011 and crores of rupees
 ke ghotaale pesh kiye
 If Anand Kumar has already left the Income Tax Department, will Yadav Singh have the same condition? No, i believe that only after Yadav Singh comes under the grip of Anand Kumar will Anand Kumar come into the grip
 lekin iske liye maamle kii jaanch iskar vibhaag kii jagah pravartan nideshaalay ko di jaani chahie
 The evidence found against Yadav Singh will go the way of reaching Mayawati's brother
 maine pravartan nideshaalay ko is bare main patr bhi likhaa he
 Shouldn't Yadav Singh have erased the evidence in three years' time? Every accused wants to be erased
 mujhe puraa andeshaa he ki yadav singh ne bhi aisa kiya hoga
 But if the investigating agency can do so with full will and political bosses are not able to interfere, then there is no reason for black money from within the country to be accounted for
 950 karod ru
 Are you confident even after Yadav Singh's acquittal in the CBCID investigation in the Noida land scam? Because both of them have weaved a whole web of benami companies
 iskar vibhaag ko sirf tex se matlab he
 But the ED will also ask where did the money come from? Secondly, there is no longer a UPA government at the Center, which bargains for political gains

 jabaki idi ne court ko bataaya tha ki maalya kaa vyavhaar sandigdh he or unke bharat aane par koi roak nahin lagaai gai he

 Mallya was not approached to acquire them

 Mallya had told the trial court that he wanted to come to India
 unhone kaha tha ki passport par lagi roak ke kaaran vah bharat nahin aa sake the
 The entire case dates back to 1995, with the ED alleging that Mallya violated the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA)

 Many leaders have to overcome the historical dilemma for success
 rahul gandhi ko na sirf yah karnaa padaa, balki unhen apni viraasat ke sankoch se bhi ubarna padaa
 The challenge before him was to be born in a great political family and live up to the aspirations arising from it
 rajnatik jivan ke shuruaati daur main un par shreshthata thopane kii koshishen huin
 When those efforts were reversed, Rahul became even more hesitant and cautious
 unki viraasat hi unke liye rukaawat ban gai
 Rahul Gandhi's real development began when he realized that power does not easily make way for another
 vaarison ko unki viraasat se ek badi puunji to mil sakati he—chaahe vah naam kii shakl main ho, yaa pratishtha, abha yaa phir chatukaar party mashinari ke rup main ho
 But if Rahul has to earn a name like some of his forefathers, then it is clear that he will have to earn his place in history through hard work
 namdaar ko kaamadaar bananaa hoga
 This realization has transformed Rahul's personality from a rapturous, impatient and carefree successor of the nehru-gandhi family to a serious, intelligent and fearless leader of the country's oldest party
 29 april ko apane chartered falcon jet vimaan main rahul ne india today se khaas baatcheet main, pradhanmantri narendra modi ke 'namdaar' ke taane par tamtamaakar kaha, ''yah kahana aasaan he
 People from my family have been in politics, but my experience is completely different from their experience
 meraa anubhav jabardast sangharsh or hinsa vaala rahaa he
 i have witnessed the murder of my father and grandmother, i have won and lost elections
 aap mere puure anubhav ko ek shabd main kaise samet sakate hai? main kya hum or kya kiya he, usase mujhe samajhen or meraa akalan karen
 Ironically, his bitter critic Narendra Modi created a ripple in 2014, giving the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) an unprecedented success and bringing the Congress to the lowest of 44 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha
 rahul is apmanjanak haar ko 'gajab kaa tufaan' bataate hai jisane party ke kaamkaaj or upie-2 ke antim varshon main sarkaar kii galatiyon ke nirmam aatmanirikshan kaa maahaul taiyaar kiya
 Rahul confesses those mistakes in the conversation
 isi sankat kii pidaa ne unke rajnatik darshan ko aakaar diya or usee prakaar dhaala jis prakaar vipashyana ke kathin satron ne unhen apni aatma se saakshaatkaar kaa mauka pradaan kiya
 In his new avatar with renewed wisdom and determination, Rahul began to re-create the Congress, which posed a formidable challenge to Modi and the BJP
 rahul ko sammaan milane laga or 2017 main congress adhyaksh ke rup main kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke baad unki yojana ko gati mili
 The Congress, revived in the elections held last year after his presidency, drove the BJP out of power in the Hindi heartland states — Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 haalanki rahul ne congress kii rashtriya manch par vaapasi kii jo saahasik yojanaayen banaai hai or jo ranneetiyaan taiyaar kii hai, unki asli pariksha 2019 ke chunaav main hogi
 This is in many ways a do or die battle for the party
 rahul ko yah bakhubi ehsaas he ki agar congress is baar bhi 2014 jaisaa kharaab pradarshan karti he, to vah na keval party ke liye, balki nehru-gandhi parivaar ke liye bhi bahut ghaatak siddh hoga (record ke liye yah yaad kiya ja saktaa he ki 2019 main unke parnana motilal nehru ko congress adhyaksh ke rup main padbhaar grahan kiye sau saal puure ho rahe hai) agar modi kii majboot vaapasi hoti he, to bhaajapa un rajyon main congress sarkaron ko asthir karne kii koshish karegi, jahaan vah arase baad satta main lauti he
 Not only this, on returning to power for the second time, the Modi government will try to pursue legal cases against Rahul and his family members with fresh and renewed vigor so as to discredit them
 haalanki baatcheet main rahul congress kii jeet kaa anumaan lagane ko taiyaar nahin hai (dekhen baatcheet), lekin ve in chunaavon main modi or bhaajapa kii haar ko pakkaa maanakar chal rahe hai
 He says, "I can't see anything else
 arjuna kii tarah, main keval machhlee kii aankh dekh rahaa hum, or main us lakshya ko bedhane vaala hum
 "the use of metaphors of Hindu mythology is one of the many arrows that Rahul has filled in his cravings as part of his strategy to attack the BJP
" 2014 main haar ke baad congress party ko ehsaas hua ki use apni muslim samarthak chhavi se nijaat paane or hindu vot bank ko lubhaane kii jarurat he
 The extremely inaccessible ascent of the Kedarnath temple in the summer of 2015 was his first step towards challenging the BJP in 2019
 unhone tab khud ko dattatreya gotra kaa janeudhari shivbhakt brahman ghoshit kiya
 Along with continuing his trips to the temples, Rahul also started a Bharat Yatra, which included traveling by train and flying in economy class in aircraft, from Sabzi Mandi in Punjab to fishermen in Kerala
 har yatra main ek antarnihit sandesh hota tha—agar modi suut-boot kii sarkaar kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, to rahul garibon ke maseehaa ban rahe the, yahaan tak ki apane kurte kii fatty jeb bhi dikhaa rahe the
 Among the biggest changes was his increased confidence in social media where Modi and BJP are already big players
 rahul ne iskaa istemaal bhaajapa par apane bharpoor praharon ke liye kiya
 Therefore, instead of 'jupiter's velocity' and 'satta Zahra Hai', now tweets like 'gabbar Singh Tax' and 'mr
 56 Inch' and the latest 'chowkidar Chor Hai' appear
 pichhali galatiyon se sikhte hue, rahul ne adhyaksh ke rup main party ko chalaane ke apane tareeke ko bhi badal diya
 Now he was not only surrounded by educated, foreign-educated youth brigades who were sharp but they lacked a combative attitude and political acumen
 ab unke zyaadaatar faislon main ahamed patel or ashok gahalot jaise puraane, anbhavi or bharosemand logon kii aawaaj mukhar hoti he
 After victories in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it was widely expected that he would make young leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sachin Pilot the chief minister
 iske bajaae, unhone party ke diggajon—kamalnath or gahalot par bharosa jataayaa
 In the conversation, he explains the reason for this, "there are a large number of senior leaders who have given a lot of their time to the party, sacrificed for the party and they have a lot of knowledge and experience, while some with tremendous energy and potential There are also extremely talented youngsters
 maine pehle gyaan or anubhav par bharosa jataane kaa nirnay liya or kuch samay baad, yuvaaon kii urja ko aajamaaya jayega
 For the 2019 election, as Rahul mentioned in the conversation, the Congress has a clear game plan
 yah dotarafa ranneeti he
 One, projecting the Congress and myself as the main characters challenging the BJP and Modi and presenting an alternative vision of governance in the country
 isliye, bhaajapa khud ko rashtrawaad ke champion or balakot ke baad bharat kii suraksha kii rakshak ke rup main pesh kar rahi he, to rahul ne congress ko ekta ke bade pairokaar ke rup main pesh kiya he or modi par samaaj ko baantne kii raajnneeti main lipt hone kaa aarope lagaaya he

 ek aam dharna he ki android smartfones aipal ios yani yphone ke mukaable kam sicyor hote hai
 However, it is not just the perception but there have been many such cases, which have made it clear that Android is weak in terms of security
 lekin android ke security diarector adryan ludwing ne daawa kiya he ki android bhi yphone jitna hi sicyor he
 Obviously, who calls their product bad, but when Google has made such claims, then it is important to know what is the reason behind this
 manhaton ke ek security conference main unhone kaha he ki haal hi main launch hua Google Pixel or Pixel XL security ke lihaaj se iphone ke baraabar he
 He has said that Android's open eco system will prove to be a much better place for a long time
 iske alaava unhone yah bhi kaa ki aane vaale dinon main android or bhi sicyor hoga
 The security director of Android spoke about Android's built-in security software Safety Net, which is capable of scanning 400 million devices and 6 billion apps in a day
 is software kaa kaam yah sunishchit karnaa he ki koi divaais mailaware se infected he yaa nahin
 He showed a graph showing that only 1 percent of Android devices in the world are suffering from dangerous applications i
e
 pha
 is conference ke dauraan unhone pichley saal capopular bag stamphrite mailavareke bare main bhi baat kii
 Ludwing said that even though people were at risk from this malware, no device has been hacked from this malware yet
 haalanki unhone yah mana he ki android yuj karne vaale mobile network karier or phone market ko iske software or security ptch dene main jaldbaaji karne kii darkaar he
 Android is secure, but its users are also secure? If you listen to the security director of Android, are the users who use it also secure? Significantly, one of the major reasons for the security of Android users is to break

 From this it seems that their chat show is also going to start in a few days
 karan johar ne poocha, aakhir fawaad kyon jaaen pakistan
 
 
 a few days ago it was also discussed that Karan has approached Grammy Award winning singer Justin Bieber for his show
 kaha ja rahaa tha ki justin bibar KWK-6 ke pehle mehmaan honge
 If that happens, this will be the first time Justin Bieber will be part of an Indian chat show

 kochi vanade main team india ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Nobody had a sense of how the team would lose so badly
 westeindies team main tufaani kris gail or karishmai sunil naren bhi nahin the
 The conflict between the board and the players was different
 team ke khilaadiyon kaa manobal bhi tutaa hua tha, lekin kochi ke maidan main khilne utari westeindies kii team ekadam aatmavishvaas se bhari dikhaai di
 Batting first, the West Indies scored 321 runs in 50 overs
 mushkil halaat main ballebaaji karte hue windies ke ballebaajon ne joardaar pradarshan kiya or iske baad westeindies ke gendbaajon ke saamne bhartiya ballebaaji dhah gai
 Lack of match winner westeindies kii jeet ke hero rahe sampuls ne is saal kaa mahaj teesraa vanade khelte hue dinesh ramdin ke saath badi saajhedaari nibhaakar team ko vishaal score tak pahunchaaya
 Samuels also scored fast and kept wickets from one end while no batsman could play the same role in the Indian innings
 shikhar dhawan jarur krij par tike, lekin vah team kii pari ko jamaane main naakaam rahe
 Apart from Ajinkya Rahane, he could not play a big partnership with anyone else
 bharat kii lachar gendbaaji West Indies batsmen managed to reach the stormy score, the biggest reason for this was the poor performance of the Indian bowlers
 bhubaneshwar kumaar ne kaaphi prabhavi gendbaaji jarur kii lekin vah koi wicket nahin jhatak paae
 Shami took four wickets, but could not control the run
 vahiin spin gendbaazi main amit mishra or ravinder jadeja ne kaaphi niraash kiya
 The failure of the spinners on the home ground has made the team management difficult
 oleroundaron kaa dam Batsmen like Suresh Raina and Ambati Rayudu have been useful bowling in the Indian team, but captain Dhoni could not make good use of both of them
 jadeja olerounder ke role main khel to rahe hai, lekin windies ke oleroundaron kii tulana main ve maarak nahin hai
 On the other hand, the presence of Dhakad all-rounders makes the Windies team look very strong
 dwen braavo, dwen smith, sampuls or darren saimi jaise oleroundaron kii maujuudagi se windies kaa palada baari dikh rahaa he
 Batsman failure kochi vanade main haar kii sabase badi vajah ballebaajon kii naakaami rahi
 The Indian team has been successfully chasing over 300 runs in recent times, but the failure of Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina in the middle order has increased the pressure on the team
 ajinkya rahane or shikhar dhawan ko bhi lambii pari khilne par dhyaan dena hoga jabaki ambati raidu ke saamne mauka he ki vah team main apni jagah sunishchit kar saken
 If the Indian batting failure continues, then it will not be easy to return to the series

 Journalists asked if he could not be caught
 kisi ne yah poocha ki maarane ke baad uski tasviir sarkaar kii taraf se soshal media par kyon daali gai
 There was some other reason to deliberately provoke people
 jawaab mila ki jo pratikriya dekhne ko mili uski kalpana hamane nahin kii thi
 While in Kashmir, everyone knows that the arrival of crowds in every mass of terrorist has become a new way

 His question is that some people are glamorizing terrorism
 kai baar ye kuch secular log ho jate hai
 In this way, this question is being asked as if the problem of Kashmir is due to the Facebook posts of these two people
 unhen kashmir ke bheetar janaaze main aae hazaron log nahin dikh rahe
 Why does the media not talk to these people
 kya sarkaar kii tarah media ko bhi bharosa nahin rahaa

 i spoke to a Kashmiri youth
 usase jo baatcheet hui, main us baatcheet ke aadhaar par ek kashmiri noujvaan kii bechainiyon ko aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum
 Keep in mind that the conversation is with only one
 isliye main bahut daawey se nahin kah saktaa ki ise bahusankhyak yuvaaon kii awaz maan sakate hai yaa nahin
 The comments wo ladkaa kashmir se baahar bharat main hi kisi college main padhata he
 He said that as long as he is on the campus of the college, his experiences are normal about India
 kai baar bahut achche bhi hote hai
 When he goes off campus his experiences begin to change
 log use kashmiri or musalmaan ke alag alag chashmon se dekhne lagate hai
 "I like the constitution of India, but when i think that one can decide what we eat, what we drink and how we live, then i get worried
" jab main bharat ke kalege se kashmir jaataa hum to ek taraf china dikhaai detaa he

 Political Islam is ever taken advantage of which pushes our way to terror

 " sawaal hero banaam aatankwaad kaa nahin he
 The question is of dialogue
 kashmir se aap kaise baat karte hai, kya samaj kar baat karte hai
 If you set the politics of North India under the pretext of Kashmir, then the result may not be what you want to achieve by winning in these debates
 mujhe us ladke se baat kar yahi laga ki kashmir se baat kii jaae
 Are we talking to Kashmir? jab ve laut kar ain to mechap room main baatcheet ke dauraan yah sawaal uthaa ki kitne darshakon main tivi reporting ke is puraane formet ke liye dhiraj bachaa hoga
 This incident came to mind after the death of Burhan Muzaffar Wani on Friday night
 aap darshakon kii dilchaspee kaa formet bhale badal gaya ho magar kashmir ke halaat to nahin badale hai
 Yes or no can not understand the situation in Kashmir
 reporting kii baariki hi aapaki samaj kaa aadhaar taiyaar karegi
 Barkha had said in his report that educated youth are going on the path of terror
 inamen se koi topper he to koi cricketer
 For them, the path of terror has become the way of glamor
 zaahir he wo aatank main glamer kii chhaunk nahin daal rahi thim balki glamer hote aatankwaad ke nae daur kii soochna aapako de rahi thim ki vahaan ab aatankwaadi apana cheharaa or naam nahin chhipate
 Putting your photos on social media
 vaise 'telegraph' main sankarshan thakur kii report padhenge to usamen bhi yahi he ki suraksha agenciyaan bhi sarkaar ko apni report main isi nae daur kii baat likh rahi thim
 In the last six months, about 80 terrorists have been killed in the encounter
 yah koi saamaanya sankhya nahin he
 Masses of terrorists have witnessed a huge crowd
 janaaza vahaan ke samaaj ke ek tabake kaa shaktipradarshan kaa zariyaa ban gaya he
 What has happened that seems to be returning to the path of Kashmir peace, where there has been a surge of tourists, people were praising the work of the army during the flood, the Prime Minister was also present there on the night of Diwali, what happened there It was then that a new round of terror began to appear
 jis dakshin kashmir ke anantnag se kuch hi din pehle mahabuuba mufti chunaav jeetin, pradhanmantri ne badhai twit kiya, unheen ilaakon se janaaze main itani bheed kaise jamaa ho gai
 Journalists covering Kashmir have also been surprised by the number of people involved in the massacre of Burhan, the commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen

 dilli kare to kya kare
 i spoke to a Kashmiri youth
 usase jo baatcheet hui, main us baatcheet ke aadhaar par ek kashmiri noujvaan kii bechainiyon ko aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum
 Keep in mind that the conversation is with only one
 isliye main bahut daawey se nahin kah saktaa ki ise bahusankhyak yuvaaon kii awaz maan sakate hai yaa nahin
 The comments wo ladkaa kashmir se baahar bharat main hi kisi college main padhata he
 He said that as long as he is on the campus of the college, his experiences are normal about India
 kai baar bahut achche bhi hote hai
 When he goes off campus his experiences begin to change
 log use kashmiri or musalmaan ke alag alag chashmon se dekhne lagate hai
 "I like the constitution of India, but when i think that one can decide what we eat, what we drink and how we live, then i get worried
" jab main bharat ke kalege se kashmir jaataa hum to ek taraf china dikhaai detaa he
 Pakistan appears on one side
 donon par bharosa nahin hota
 The way of India is visible, but its excesses make me restless
 mujhase baat karne vaala koi nahi he
 There is no one to tell me the way
 main apane vajood ko lekar pareshaan hota rahata hum
 Political Islam is ever taken advantage of which pushes our way to terror
 ham duvidha main hai
 " sawaal hero banaam aatankwaad kaa nahin he
 The question is of dialogue
 kashmir se aap kaise baat karte hai, kya samaj kar baat karte hai
 If you set the politics of North India under the pretext of Kashmir, then the result may not be what you want to achieve by winning in these debates
 mujhe us ladke se baat kar yahi laga ki kashmir se baat kii jaae
 Are we talking to Kashmir? pichley chah maheene main encounter main kareeb 80 aatankwaadi maare gaye hai
 This is not a common number
 kai aatankwaadiyon ke janaaze main baari bheed dekhi gai he
 Janaza has become the medium of power performance of a section of the society there
 aisa kya ho gaya jo kashmir shanti ke raste par lautataa dikh rahaa tha, jahaan paryatakon ke jane kaa silsilaa bad gaya tha, baadh ke samay sena ke kaam kii log tarif kar rahe the, diwaali kii raat pradhanmantri bhi vahiin maujuud rahe, vahaan aisa kya ho gaya ki aatank kaa ek nayaa daur saamne dikhne laga
 The Prime Minister tweeted congratulations to the south Kashmir of Anantnag, which won the elections just a few days before Anantnag, how did such a crowd gather in Janaje from the same areas
 hizbul mujahidin ke commander burhan ke janaaze main shaamil logon kii sankhya se kashmir cover karne vaale patrkaar bhi hairaan hai
 When reporters were talking to security agencies, they started asking why the encounter took place at this time while the agencies had been tracking Burhan for a long time
 patrakaron ne poocha ki kya wo pakadaa nahin ja saktaa tha
 Someone asked why his picture was uploaded on social media from the government after the killing
 jaanboojh kar logon ko uksaane ke liye yaa koi or vajah thi
 The response was that we had not imagined the response
 jabaki kashmir main sabko maaloom he ki aatankwaadi ke har janaaze main bheed kaa pahunchnaa ek nayaa tarika ho gaya he
 Raibahadurs of TV channels and social media have done a trick
 unke sawaal he ki kuch log aatankwaad ko glamraise kar rahe hai
 Sometimes they become some secular people
 is tarah se yah sawaal poocha ja rahaa he jaise kashmir kii samasya inhen do chaar logon ke fasebuk post ke kaaran he
 They do not see thousands of people coming to the temple inside Kashmir
 media in logon se baat kyon nahin karata he
 Did the media not believe like the government? baharhaal tivi ne apana sawaal chun liya he
 He will not listen to the voice of Kashmir
 kisi secular ko khalanaayak banaakar aapako apni baat sunaayegaa
 This time the government is also cautious in view of the situation
 isliye wo vipaksh ko bhi bharose main lekar chal rahi he
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh has called Sonia Gandhi and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah
 rashtriya suraksha ke masale main sarkaar or vipaksh ek saath lagate hai
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh has praised the statement of Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad
 yah sab kyon ho rahaa he
 Probably because the situation does not get worse
 sarkaar ke saath-saath dilli kii media ko bhi satarkta baratani chahie
 The question will arise how terrorism has come to such an extent that it is being talked about
 'scrol' website par hamane ek report dekhi
 When you look at how Kashmir has been reported in the media, you will understand the distance between Delhi and Srinagar
 'greater kashmir' akhbaar ne aatankwaadi nahin likhaa
 Wrote Burhan
 aise likhaa jaise koi chitkaar uthi ho or use pukaara ho
 'rising Kashmir' wrote that Burhan received an unexpected farewell
 'kashmir monitor' ne commander burhan likhaa
 Delhi's media starts with terrorist and ends with terrorist
 yah antar kyon hai
 Does the TV media in Delhi not want to know at all why these people have come to join the funeral of a terrorist
 is sawaal main kya karaabi he
 Why Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti had to appeal to those same separatists for peace
 algaavvaadi syed ali shah gilaani ne logon se apil kii he ki thanon par hamalaa na karen or sampradayik sadbhaav banaakar rakhen
 You remember that on this Geelani, spokespersons of some TV channels and parties keep evoking their basic understanding of nationalism
 kya ab ve apane sawaalon ko dhunenge ki aatankwaad se ladanaa he to algaavaadi hurriyat netaa se apil kyon kii jaati he jo bharat sthit pakistan ke duutavas main iftaar khaane jate hai
 Both the central and state governments face a serious challenge
 wo ankaron ke bhadakaau sawaalon kii tarah rashtriya suraksha kaa moolyankan nahin kar sakati he
 Thankfully, this time no one seems to be in his deception
 kashmir main halaat saamaanya bataaye ja rahe hai magar sthiti niyantran main hote hue bhi nahin he
 The death toll in the violence has increased to 23
 badi sankhya main surakshakarmi or aam log bhi ghayal hue hai
 The anger of the people is so furious that several police stations have been attacked and a police car was thrown into the Jhelum river and a young man was also killed
 is ghatana se mahabuuba mufti ke liye bhi mushkilen badi hai
 His party MP Hamid Karra has said in a statement to a website called Kashmir Life that the PDP has changed
 2008 main jab firing main 6 noujvaan mare the tab pidipi sarkaar se baahar aa gai thi
 This time 18 youth have been killed but the PDP is silent
 zero tolerance or maximum ristrain yani adhiktam sanyam kii niti khokhli sabit hui he
 He has accused both the Center and the state
 karra ne kaha he ki chah maheene se ghati ubal rahi he magar pidipi-aresas ke saath galabahiyaan kar rahi he
 Mehbooba Mufti also understands this challenge
 unhone kaha he ki baad kii ghatnaon main maare gaye logon kii sthiti ke bare main gaur karengi
 Government spokesman Naeem Akhtar has said that the protesters are responsible for the death
 sarkaar sabhi mauton kii jaanch karegi ki kahin sena ne galat goli chalaai he
 But in most cases the protesters have attacked the police stations
 bahut jagahon par police ko kadam uthaane ke liye majaboor hona padaa he
 The Amarnath Yatra has begun
 yah ek raahat kii khabar he or halaat saamaanya hone kii nishaani
 What to do if Delhi maine ek kashmiri noujvaan se baat kii
 On the basis of the conversation that i had with him, i would like to put the restlessness of a Kashmiri youth in front of you
 dhyaan rahe ki baatcheet sirf ek se hui he
 Therefore, i cannot say with much assertion whether it can be considered as the voice of the majority of youth
 tippaniyan The boy studies in a college outside India only in Kashmir
 usne kaha ki jab tak wo college ke campus main he uske anubhav bharat ko lekar saamaanya hi hote hai
 Many times are also very good
 jab wo campus se baahar jaataa he uske anubhav badalane lagate hai
 People start seeing him through different glasses of Kashmiri and Muslim
 "mujhe hindustan kaa samvidhan acha lagata he magar jab lagata he ki uske rahete bhi koi yah tay kar saktaa he ki ham kya khaaye kya piiye or kaise rahen to main chintit ho jaataa hum
 When i go to Kashmir from India's college, China appears on one side
 ek taraf pakistan dikhaai detaa he
 Both are not trusted
 hindustan kaa hi rasta dikhataa he magar uski zyadatiyaan mujhe baichaiyn kar detii hai
 There is no one to talk to me mujhe rasta bataane vaala koi nahin he
 i keep getting worried about my existence
 iskaa phayda kabhi polytical islam uthaa letaa he jo hamaare jaison ko aatank ke raste par dhakel detaa he
 We are in a dilemma
 " The question is not about hero versus terrorism
 sawaal he samvaad kaa
 How do you talk to Kashmir and understand it? kashmir ke bahaane uttar bharat kii raajnneeti agar set karenge to iskaa nateeja shaayad wo nahin ho jo aap in bahaso main jitkar hasil kar lenaa chaahate hai
 i felt that talking to that boy should be talked to Kashmir
 kya ham kashmir se baat kar rahe hai? Journalists covering Kashmir have also been surprised by the number of people involved in the massacre of Burhan, the commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen

 Are we talking to Kashmir? halaat ko dekhte hue is baar sarkaar bhi satark he
 Therefore, she is also taking the opposition into confidence
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne sonia gandhi or neshnal conference ke netaa umr abdulla ko phone kiya he
 On the issue of national security, the government and the opposition seem together
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne congress netaa gulam nabi azaad ke bayaan kii saraahna kii he
 Why is all this happening? shaayad isliye ki halaat or na bighad jaaen
 The government as well as the media in Delhi should also be cautious
 yah sawaal uthegaa ki aatankwaad kaise is had tak aa gaya jab ki uske niyantran main aa jane kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 We saw a report on the scroll website
 kashmir kii media main kis tarah reporting hui he, jab aap yah dekhenge to dilli or srinagar kii duuri samaj aa jaaegi
 The 'greater Kashmir' newspaper did not write terrorists
 burhan likhaa
 Wrote as if a concern had arisen and called it
 'rising kashmir' ne likhaa ki burhan ko apratyaashit vidaai mili
 'kashmir Monitor' wrote Commander Burhan
 dilli kii media aatankwaadi se shuru hota he or aatankwaadi par khatm hota he
 Why are these differences
 kya dilli kaa tivi media bilkul hi nahin jaananaa chahta he ki ye log kyon ek aatankwaadi ke janaaze main shaamil hone aae hai
 What is wrong with this question kyon jammu-kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ko unheen algaavvaadiyon se shanti kii apil kerani padi he
 The separatist Syed Ali Shah Geelani appealed to the people not to attack the police stations and maintain communal harmony
 aap yaad kiijie isi gilaani ko lekar kuch tivi channel or partiyon ke pravaktaa apana rashtrawaad kii adhakachari samaj ugalate rahete hai
 Will they now tune their questions that if they want to fight terrorism, then why is there an appeal to the separatist Hurriyat leader who goes to Iftari to Pakistan's Embassy in India
 centre or rajya sarkaar donon ke saamne gambhir chunauti he
 She cannot evaluate national security like the provocative questions of anchors
 ganimat he is baar koi unke jhaanse main nahin lagata
 The situation in Kashmir is being described as normal but the situation is not under control
 jagah-jagah hui hinsa main marane waalon kii sankhya 23 pahunch gai he
 a large number of security personnel and common people have also been injured
 logon kaa gussa itnaa bhadkaa hua he ki kai thanon par hamalaa hua he or ek police kii gaadi jhelum nadi main phenk di gai or ek jawan kii maut bhi ho gai
 This incident has also increased difficulties for Mehbooba Mufti
 unki party ke saansad hamid karra ne kashmir life naam kii website ko die apane bayaan main kaha he ki pidipi badal gai he
 In 2008, when 6 youth died in the firing, the PDP came out of the government
 is baar 18 noujvaan maare gaye hai magar pidipi chup he
 The policy of zero restraint and maximum restraint has proved to be hollow
 unhone centre or rajya donon par aarope lagaae hai
 Karra has said that for six months the valley has been boiling but the PDP-RSS is doing mistakes
 mahabuuba mufti bhi is chunauti ko samajhati hai
 He has said that he will look into the situation of those killed in the subsequent incidents
 sarkaar ke pravaktaa naeem akhtar ne kaha he jo maut hui he uske liye pradarshnkaree zimmedaar hai
 The government will investigate all deaths whether the army has shot the wrong shot
 magar zyaadaatar maamalon main pradarshnakario ne thanon par hamalaa kiya he
 Police has been forced to take steps in many places
 amarnath yatra shuru ho gai he
 This is a relief news and a sign of normalcy
 dilli kare to kya kare
 i spoke to a Kashmiri youth
 usase jo baatcheet hui, main us baatcheet ke aadhaar par ek kashmiri noujvaan kii bechainiyon ko aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum
 Keep in mind that the conversation is with only one
 isliye main bahut daawey se nahin kah saktaa ki ise bahusankhyak yuvaaon kii awaz maan sakate hai yaa nahin
 The comments wo ladkaa kashmir se baahar bharat main hi kisi college main padhata he
 He said that as long as he is on the campus of the college, his experiences are normal about India
 kai baar bahut achche bhi hote hai
 When he goes off campus his experiences begin to change
 log use kashmiri or musalmaan ke alag alag chashmon se dekhne lagate hai
 "I like the constitution of India, but when i think that one can decide what we eat, what we drink and how we live, then i get worried
" jab main bharat ke kalege se kashmir jaataa hum to ek taraf china dikhaai detaa he
 Pakistan appears on one side
 donon par bharosa nahin hota
 The way of India is visible, but its excesses make me restless
 mujhase baat karne vaala koi nahi he
 There is no one to tell me the way
 main apane vajood ko lekar pareshaan hota rahata hum
 Political Islam is ever taken advantage of which pushes our way to terror
 ham duvidha main hai
 " sawaal hero banaam aatankwaad kaa nahin he
 The question is of dialogue
 kashmir se aap kaise baat karte hai, kya samaj kar baat karte hai
 If you set the politics of North India under the pretext of Kashmir, then the result may not be what you want to achieve by winning in these debates
 mujhe us ladke se baat kar yahi laga ki kashmir se baat kii jaae
 Are we talking to Kashmir? sarkaar ke saath-saath dilli kii media ko bhi satarkta baratani chahie
 The question will arise how terrorism has come to such an extent that it is being talked about
 'scrol' website par hamane ek report dekhi
 When you look at how Kashmir has been reported in the media, you will understand the distance between Delhi and Srinagar
 'greater kashmir' akhbaar ne aatankwaadi nahin likhaa
 Wrote Burhan
 aise likhaa jaise koi chitkaar uthi ho or use pukaara ho
 'rising Kashmir' wrote that Burhan received an unexpected farewell
 'kashmir monitor' ne commander burhan likhaa
 Delhi's media starts with terrorist and ends with terrorist
 yah antar kyon hai
 Does the TV media in Delhi not want to know at all why these people have come to join the funeral of a terrorist
 is sawaal main kya karaabi he
 Why Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti had to appeal to those same separatists for peace
 algaavvaadi syed ali shah gilaani ne logon se apil kii he ki thanon par hamalaa na karen or sampradayik sadbhaav banaakar rakhen
 You remember that on this Geelani, spokespersons of some TV channels and parties keep evoking their basic understanding of nationalism
 kya ab ve apane sawaalon ko dhunenge ki aatankwaad se ladanaa he to algaavaadi hurriyat netaa se apil kyon kii jaati he jo bharat sthit pakistan ke duutavas main iftaar khaane jate hai
 Both the central and state governments face a serious challenge
 wo ankaron ke bhadakaau sawaalon kii tarah rashtriya suraksha kaa moolyankan nahin kar sakati he
 Thankfully, this time no one seems to be in his deception
 kashmir main halaat saamaanya bataaye ja rahe hai magar sthiti niyantran main hote hue bhi nahin he
 The death toll in the violence has increased to 23
 badi sankhya main surakshakarmi or aam log bhi ghayal hue hai
 The anger of the people is so furious that several police stations have been attacked and a police car was thrown into the Jhelum river and a young man was also killed
 is ghatana se mahabuuba mufti ke liye bhi mushkilen badi hai
 His party MP Hamid Karra has said in a statement to a website called Kashmir Life that the PDP has changed
 2008 main jab firing main 6 noujvaan mare the tab pidipi sarkaar se baahar aa gai thi
 This time 18 youth have been killed but the PDP is silent
 zero tolerance or maximum ristrain yani adhiktam sanyam kii niti khokhli sabit hui he
 He has accused both the Center and the state
 karra ne kaha he ki chah maheene se ghati ubal rahi he magar pidipi-aresas ke saath galabahiyaan kar rahi he
 Mehbooba Mufti also understands this challenge
 unhone kaha he ki baad kii ghatnaon main maare gaye logon kii sthiti ke bare main gaur karengi
 Government spokesman Naeem Akhtar has said that the protesters are responsible for the death
 sarkaar sabhi mauton kii jaanch karegi ki kahin sena ne galat goli chalaai he
 But in most cases the protesters have attacked the police stations
 bahut jagahon par police ko kadam uthaane ke liye majaboor hona padaa he
 The Amarnath Yatra has begun
 yah ek raahat kii khabar he or halaat saamaanya hone kii nishaani
 What to do if Delhi maine ek kashmiri noujvaan se baat kii
 On the basis of the conversation that i had with him, i would like to put the restlessness of a Kashmiri youth in front of you
 dhyaan rahe ki baatcheet sirf ek se hui he
 Therefore, i cannot say with much assertion whether it can be considered as the voice of the majority of youth
 tippaniyan The boy studies in a college outside India only in Kashmir
 usne kaha ki jab tak wo college ke campus main he uske anubhav bharat ko lekar saamaanya hi hote hai
 Many times are also very good
 jab wo campus se baahar jaataa he uske anubhav badalane lagate hai
 People start seeing him through different glasses of Kashmiri and Muslim
 "mujhe hindustan kaa samvidhan acha lagata he magar jab lagata he ki uske rahete bhi koi yah tay kar saktaa he ki ham kya khaaye kya piiye or kaise rahen to main chintit ho jaataa hum
 When i go to Kashmir from India's college, China appears on one side

 Both are not trusted
 hindustan kaa hi rasta dikhataa he magar uski zyadatiyaan mujhe baichaiyn kar detii hai
 There is no one to talk to me mujhe rasta bataane vaala koi nahin he

 The Chief Minister will belong to Shiv Sena
 
 
 mukhyamantri to shivasena kaa hi banegaa
 
 
 Ever since the Maharashtra Assembly election results have come, one voice used to repeat the same thing every day, but it was mocked by opponents and social media trolls
 lekin aaj yahi baat sach hone ja rahi he
 Shiv Sena spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut was constantly on a mission mode, which he has completed
 bayanon ke jariye bhartiya janata party par nishaanaa sadhana ho, CM pad kii maang ko lekar ad janaa ho yaa soshal media ke jariye janata tak sandesh pahunchaana ho sanjay raut ne har morche par ‘shivasainik’ ke taur par kaam kiya
 When it was decided that Uddhav Thackeray would become the Chief Minister, Sanjay Raut made the same statement that the promise he had made to Bal Thackeray has been fulfilled today
 shivasena kii awaz bane sanjay raut
 
 
 Sanjay Raut is a Rajya Sabha MP on behalf of Shiv Sena, Hindi Patti or rather he is also the face of Shiv Sena at the national level
 media se baat karnaa ho yaa phir soshal media par raay rakhana, sanjay raut ke bayaan ko hi shivasena kii raay mana jaataa rahaa he
 He continued to attack the BJP through sharp remarks, he devoted his life to get the Chief Minister's post to Shiv Sena
 ab jab shivasena kaa mukhyamantri ban rahaa he to uskaa credit sanjay raut ko bhi diya ja rahaa he
 Attack on the government through confrontation
 
 
 sanjay raut shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana ke editor hai yani sampadakeey main jo chhapata he vah unki sahmati se hi hota he
 In the last five years, the Shiv Sena attacked the central government only through Saamana, when the turn of the elections came, pressure was put on the Bharatiya Janata Party through the articles in Saamana, from ticket sharing to settlement
 or jab chunaav nattejey aae, to bhi mukhyamantri pad ko lekar khinchataan ke liye saamana ko hi hathiyaar banaaya gaya
 How is josh? Used to go
 kyonkisnjay raut shaayari ke jariye bhaajapaper nishaanaa sadhate the, phir chaahe pakistani shaayar habib jaalib kii shaayari ho yaa phir atal bihari vaajapeyi kii kavita, unke har twitor post main bhaajapa nishane par rahati thi
 This was the reason that people had named Sanjay Raut as 'raut Indouri' on social media

 Vishal Sikka has finally resigned
 istipha dene kii vajahon kaa khulaasa karte hue vishaal sikaa ne company ke karmchaariyon ko letters likhte hue kaha ki ab infosis kaa maahaul unke kaam karne laayak nahin rah gaya lihaaja vah apni jimmedaariyon ko chhod rahe hai
 According to Sikka, Infosys founder Narayana Murthy has been blaming him against him for a long time
 ek taraf jahaan vah beete teen saal ko dauraan company ko vaishvik sankaton se ubaarane kii koshish main lage the vahiin murti or unke samarthan aise aaropon se unka samay kharaab kar rahe the

 However, Vishal Sikka had always termed the questions raised in the media on the corporate governance of the company as baseless and reiterated the talk of a good relationship with Narayana Murthy
 murti samet infosis ke anya founders ne bhi sawaal uthaaya tha ki asia kii duusari sabase badi iti company main gavarnence ke kai mudde company ke hit main nahin he
 In this, the compensation given to the two top level executives of the company, including the increase in the salary of the company's CEO Vishal Sikka, is not appropriate
 lihaaja sikaa or anya adhikariyon ko mil rahi selary or die gaye harjane par founders kii taraf se murti ke netritv main board ke saamne sawaal khadaa kiya gaya tha

 The amount was questioned by SEBI, after which the founders, including Narayana Murthy, questioned some of the top officials, including Vishal Sikka, on the salary and compensation received from the company before the Infosys board

 pehle notebandi, phir farji companiyon kaa safaya karne ke baad ab sarkaar un companiyon ko tex ke daayre main laane kii taiyaari kar rahi he, jo jaanboojhkar apane bahi khate main ghaataa dikhaakar tex bachaati hai
 The central government can tighten taxation on such companies
 sarkaar iske liye nunat vaikalpik tex (mat) ke niyamon main badlaav karne kaa vichaar kar rahi he
 According to sources in the Finance Ministry, the government may impose tax on companies showing losses in the books of account in the coming budget or thereafter
 haalanki prastaav ke mutabik, vaaki main nuksaan uthaane vaali companiyon ko sarkaar tex credit par riyaayat de sakati he
 There are more than 2
5 lakh companies in the country which have deliberately shown themselves to be in loss for decades
 ye companiyaan bainkon se lone leti hai or lambey samay tak indiarect tex bhi detii aa rahi hai, lekin diarect tex yani korporate tex nahin detii hai
 How is it that the companies stealing Golmaaltax actually present their accounts to the government in two ways
 pehla inakam tex ke hisaab se doosraa company act ke mutabik
 Such companies show themselves at a loss by showing a lot of expenses in income tax
 thik usee samay kai companiyaan baari bharkam labhaansh yani dividend baantati bhi najar aati thi
 These companies used to show profits in the ledger account under the Companies Act
 sarkaar aamadani kii is do tarafa reporting ke jariye inakam tex bachaane vaali companiyon par lagaam lagane ke liye chaar dashak pehle nunatam vaikalpik kar yani (mat) lekar ai
 Now there is a plan to bring all those companies under the tax net, which have deliberately started showing artificial losses in the book profits under the Companies Act
 tex export kaa maananaa he ki is tarah ke tex main koi harj nahin he, haalanki rate nominal hona chahie
 Amarjit Chopra, former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, says, "there is no harm in taxing such companies, after all they are taking advantage of the country's resources whether it is a paid up capital or a bank loan
" haa itnaa jarur he ki agar koi tex lagata he to uskaa rate bahut kam hona chahie

 After abolishing many tax related concessions in 1991, the government said that no such minimum tax is required

 After claiming every kind of exemption under the Income Tax Rules, if the total income of the company is thirty percent less than the book profit, then the company's total income will be considered as thirty percent of the book profit and will have to pay tax accordingly
 2001 main phir se mat main badlaav hua
 The tax exemption on paid tax (carryforward) was scrapped and it was decided that companies would have to pay whichever rate is higher than corporate and MAT

 However, companies have always been opposed to Matt
 lagaataar badhate rate ke alaava companiyon kii shikaayat he ki book profit ke rakh rakhaav main dikkat hoti he
 Although the government has given concessions in MAT in certain industries, especially in sectors like infrastructure, the Finance Ministry believes that millions of companies in the country are continuously defrauding the government by showing losses
 vitt mantralay kaa maananaa he ki aisi companiyon par ko tex ke daayre main lane kii jarurat he, taaki wo minimum tex jarur den
 It is important for the government facing the pressure of income and expenditure, that it will intentionally bring the tax-escaping companies under direct tax after the elimination of shell companies

 It depicts the story of a village in 1955
 film main gaanv kaa samaaj kis tarah kaa hota he, yah dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 Earlier, on Renu's story 'killed Gulfam', Shailendra made a 'third oath' with Raj Kapoor
 kahaneerenu kii kahani ke aadhaar par film main jis gaanv ko darshaya gaya he usamen alag-alag tole hai
 These hamlets are built on ethnic basis
 jaisaa ki 1955 ke daur eman hota tha
 The village has a hamlet of Mahatos, Brahmins, Kayasthas and Yadavas
 in tolon kaa ek-duusare ke saath kis tarah rahan-sahan he, kyon ek tolaa, duusare ke saath nahin jaataa he- dikhaaya gaya he
 At the center of the story is the Mahto Tola which does not go towards the second Tola
 mahato tolaa main ek godhan naam (amitosh nagpal) naam kaa ladkaa he
 His parents die
 vah nani ke gaanv unki kii jameen-jaaydaad lene ke liye waapas aata he
 He is born in another village
 haalanki mahato tole ke log nahin chaahate ki use nani kii jaaydaad mili
 On returning, how will Mahato expel the people of Tola from his hamlet? gaanv main raasalila kaa aayojan hota he
 During this time, a lot of twists emerge
 The Panchalat is a token of respect for the tolls
 duusare tolon ke paas yah pehle se he
 People of Mahato Tola also buy a Panchalat (a kind of lantern) for the first time
 lekin unke tole main ksii ko panchalatt jalaana nahin aata
 The burning of it is done by the cow which is thrown out of the village
 is tarah hansi-khushi film khatm ho jaati he
 Why can you watch a movie? If you want to see a village in the 50s, you can watch a movie if you like Renu's stories

 varisht bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani ne ‘sahitya amrit’ patrika ke atal smriti ank main apane lekh ‘ek kavi hriday rajaneta’ main atal bihari vaajapeyi se apni ghanishtha mitrataa kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki bijepi or sattarudh rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) main kuch log sochane lage ki narendra modi ko pad chhod dena chahie, phir bhi is vishay par unka vichaar bilkul alag tha
 He wrote in his article, "in my opinion, Modi was not a criminal but he himself became a victim of politics
 isaliye maine anubhav kiya ki ek varsh se bhi kam samay pehle mukhyamantri bane narendra modi ko jatil sampradayik sthiti kaa shikaar bananaa anyaaypurna hoga
 He said that this situation had a lot of burden on Vajpayee's mind
 modi se tyaagptr maangane ke liye un par dabaav daalaa jane laga tha
 He said that at the BJP National Executive meeting in Goa in 2002, when Jaswant Singh asked Vajpayee what do you think
 atalji ne kaha ki kam se kam istife kaa ofer to karte
 Advani said, "then i said that if there is some improvement in the situation in Gujarat due to Narendra's leaving, i would like to ask him to resign but i do not believe that it will help
" ’’purv uppradhanmantri ne apane lekh main is ghatnakram ko vistaar se bataate hue kaha ki is bare main unhone narendra modi se baat kii ki unhen tyaagptr dene kaa prastaav rakhana chahie or vah tatparta se meri baat maan gaye
 But when he (modi) asked to resign, the voices of 'don't resign' echoed in the auditorium
 is prakaar is mudde par party ke bheetar bahes kaa ant ho gaya
 Advani said that another incident happened when he (atal Bihari Vajpayee) objected to the BJP joining the Ayodhya movement

 Saina Nehwal, 26 years old, how did badmintonqualify: BWF rankings at number 6 in the world: She became the number 2 player in the world in 2010, winning a gold medal in the 2010 Commonwealth Games
 2015 main ve vishwa kii number 1 khilaadi baniin
 Among the many things Saina Nehwal is known for — her games on the net, her smashes, the tricolor hairpin — the most talked about thing is her passion to withstand China
 bharat ke is padosi desh ke khilaadi unke kariyar kii shuruyaat se hi hameshaa unki ankhon main chubte rahe hai
 Now this is not a conspiracy in our neighboring country, but the reality is that the new plant of badminton players of the top rank in China is always standing to compete with the world
 sina akeli khilaadi rahi hai jinhone china kii is badminton brigade kaa datakar saamana kiya he or kabhi-kabhi use parrast bhi kiya he
 For this reason, Saina has become a separate identity in the badminton world
 ''sina banaam china" kii yahi khyatipraapt pratispardhaa is baar 2016 ke olympic khelon main phir se unki kismat kaa faisla karegi
 She is hoping to repeat at least the 2012 London Olympic Games performance in Rio, where she won a bronze medal
 haalanki unki bharsak koshish usase bhi do mukaam upar pahunchane kii hi hogi
 Saina's stature has steadily risen in the last four years
 ve vishwa kii number ek khilaadi bhi baniin, bhale hi kuch hi dinon ke liye
 But he has definitely left his magic on world badminton and has achieved so much that after taking his leave from the game, he will be remembered for a long time
 lekin unke liye kaansya se swarna padak tak kaa safar tay karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Saina herself realizes this
 ve kahati hai, ''chunautiyaan kai sari hai
 The need is that day, whether night, only badminton should be thought of all the time
 "vibhinn vyaktigat khel spardhaon main drow aksar bahut ahm bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 So a lot will depend on who gets to compete in what time — especially Tai Tzu Wing of Chinese Taipei, whose quest to unravel has become a new big puzzle for them
 sina kahati hai, ''landan olympic ke baad main number ek khilaadi bani, vishwa championships main rajat padak jeeta or kai aise khiladinnon ko haraaya jinhen main pehle kabhi nahin haraa pai thi
 But now a new Chinese Taipei kink is in front - Tai Tzu-wing
 chiniyon se har baar kii tarah ulajhane se pehle is baar unase paar paanaa mere liye sabase bada kaam hoga
 "the last six matches from Nehwal's Tzu-wing have gone in favor of the Taiwanese player
 nehwal un khiladinnon ke khilaaf acha pradarshan kar leti hai jinka khel ve samaj jaati hai or phir unke saamne taiyaari se utarati hai
 But this is not happening in the case of Tzu-wing
 bharat kii purv antarrashtriya khilaadi aparnaa popat kahati hai, ''tju-wing kaa khel unmukt pravaah vaala he, jiskaa koi ek tay rukh nahin hota or usamen achaanak se dhokhaa ho jaataa he
 It is a challenge for Saina but she can overcome it
 " agar ve aisa kar leti hai to doosraa olympic medal unki pahunch main hoga
 Pullela Gopichand was his coach in the last Olympic Games, after that he changed it to Vimal Kumar (former two-time French Open winner) as his coach
 apana thikaana bhi unhone hyderabad se bangaluru kar liya
 "this change was significant and urgent," says Saina
 ek vyaktigat trainer bahut ahm hota he kyonki khel ke dauraan har vakt sudhaar or badlaav karte rahanaa jaruri hota he
 "gopi is also a national coach and he has to watch a lot of players including another big hope of India in badminton
 ve
 Sandhu is also included
 phir ek yah kchayaal bhi chal rahaa tha ki gopi vah sab kuch sina ko pehle hi de chuke hai jo vah sina ko is mukaam tak laane ke liye kar sakate the
 It can be easily seen that they are working harder than ever to get past that extra gap
 unke training satr ke ek video main unhen saamne purush khiladinnon ko khadaa karke anjayas karte dekha ja saktaa tha
 It was a small glimpse of the extent to which she was going to physically prepare herself to overcome this provisional challenge
 rio se pehle sina ko kai upnaam mil chuke hai, jinamein se ek bharat ke sheersh purush badminton khilaadi parupalli kashyap ne diya tha— ''badminton kii tendulkar
 "saina has indeed achieved such a feat that she can be called this in the context of badminton
 ab kya vah ise vishwa str par ek nai oonchai tak le ja sakati hai? yah sab is par nirbhar karegaa ki rio main unka pradarshan kaisaa rahata he
 Six US lawmakers wrote a letter to India's ambassador to the US, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, seeking access to foreign journalists and mps in Kashmir, claiming that the picture of the valley being presented by India was different from the information provided by his side

 Two days after the discussion on the human rights situation in South Asia, the mps asked Shringla six questions
 unhone poocha, ‘kya jammu-kashmir main sabhi (100 pratishat) landline sevaayen baahal ho gai hai yaa abhi kuch baaki hai? ‘preeped' sahit sabhi mobile phone sevaayen kab behaal kii jaaengi? internet sevaayen puri tarah kaise behaal kii jaaengi?'jan suraksha adhinium yaa anya kanoon ke tahat paanch agast se hiraasat main liye logon ke bare main sawaal kiya gaya or shringla se jitna sambhav ho jawaab dete samay utana vishisht hone ko bhi kaha gaya
 He asked, 'how many of them are minors? What is the standard judicial procedure for those arrested under the Public Safety Act? The mps questioned Shringla, 'what is the status of the curfew implemented in Jammu and Kashmir? What is the government's plan to allow people free movement? When can we expect this? ”he also asked the Indian Ambassador why foreign journalists are not allowed to visit Jammu and Kashmir so far
 unhen kshetra main jane kii anumati kab di jaaegi? saansadon ne poocha, ‘kya bharat sarkaar america congress ke sadasyon yaa anya videshi adhikariyon ke vahaan aane kaa swaagat karegi, jo jammu-kashmir kaa daura karnaa chaahate hai?' The widows of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh will send 1,000 hand-made ashes and sweets to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of Rakshabandhan

 In Zee tv's favorite show 'kumkum Bhagya', the distance between Abhi and Pragya is increasing instead of decreasing
 tun kaa sach saamne aane baad bhi vah badali nahin he or uski shaatir chaal main ekbar phir pragna funs gai
 This time, a new character named Champak has come to make a distance between Abhi and Pragya
 abhi or pragna ke ghar main chal rahi party main aae is mehmaan kaa daawa he ki vah aurapragna ek-duusare se pyarkarte hai
 Hearing this, the whole family is shocked and even more upset by Pragya because she does not know about herself
 chanpak kii baton main aakar or tun ke bhadakaane par abhi gusse main aakar apni bivi pragna par haath uthaane kii bhi koshish kar detaa he
 While Abhi's faith is hurt once again, Pragya's heart is also broken
 vah abhi ke aise bartaav se bahut dukhi he or isliye use sahaara dene ke liye daadi aa gai hai
 Now it will be fun to see if Tun will succeed in his trick or whether Champak's truth will be revealed to everyone

 ) In the midst of the dream of a five trillion dollar economy, what kind of brand India is becoming whose exports have crashed for the last five years? Why did India close its own market, while advising the world to open the market? We will also have to ask ourselves, why the new foreign policy, which is full of praise, could not even give us a new trade agreement in the last five years? These questions are directly related to India's latest stubborn recession because a big reason for this crisis There is also foreign trade collapses
 niryaat kii badahaali kii nai tasviir us ucchstareey sarkari samiti kii report main ubhari he, jise asia ke sabase bade vyapaar samooh yani aarasieepi (riginal comprihensive iconomic partnership) main bharat kii bhagidaari ke phaayde-nuksaan aankane ke liye isi saal banaaya gaya tha
 This committee (chairman economist Surjit Bhalla), equipped with former foreign, commerce secretaries, former director general of WTO, economic advisor and economists of Ministry of Finance and economists, had strongly recommended joining India's RCEP through a 253-page report
 aarasieepi ko peeth dikhaane se ek hafte pehle tak vaanijya mantri piyush goyal isi report ko sarkaar ke liye gita-bible-quran bataa rahe the
 The migration of India from RCEP has become more mysterious in light of this report
 haal ke varshon main pehali baar arthshaastriyon or naukarshahon ne thakursuhati chhod bharat ke videsh vyapaar ke sankat ko aankadon kii roshni dikhaai he
 The facts of the report explain why the latest recession is so challenging
 • san 2000 main antarrashtriya vyapaar (niryaat-aayaat) kii bharat ke jidipi main hissedari keval 19 fisad thi jo 2011 main badhkar 55 fisad yani aadhe se zyada ho gai jo ab 45 fisad rah gai he
 This is the reason why the growth rate of decrease in foreign trade with domestic consumption 4
 5 fisad par karaah rahi he
 • India's exports continued to fall from 2012 to 2017 as compared to 2003 to 2011
 aarasieepi par bani samiti ne gaiyr tel niryaatak 60 badi antarrashtriya arthvyavasthaaon ke saath tulana ke baad paaya ki jidipi main badhotaree or apekshaakrit sthir videshi mudra vinimay dar ke baavjood in paanch varshon main sabhi (krishi, menuphaccharing, marchendyse or sevaayen) niryaat main samakakshon ke mukaable bharat kii ranking giri he
 In view of this plight, after 2014 the GDP boom (above seven percent) is suspected
 • 2000 ke baad udaarikaran ne bharat ko software sevaayen, pharma or auto niryaat kaa garh bana diya tha
 But after 2010, India could not write any life story in exports
 • haal ke varshon main bharat ne apane pair par kulhadi maarane main visheshgyata hasil kar lee
 Customs, which had been declining continuously before 2017, began to increase under the leadership of the new government

 This protectionism has increased the problem for India in the world markets

 • RCEP opponents should be aware that all the Free Trade Agreements have been very beneficial for India
 inke tahat aayaat-niryaat kaa dhaancha sabase santulit he yani kachche maal kaa niryaat or upabhokta utpaadon kaa aayaat behad simit he
 • This report exposes the awe caused by the trade deficit with ASEAN
 yah ghaataa palm oil or rabad ke aayaat ke kaaran he, jinaki deshi aapurti simit he or ye bhartiya udyogon kaa keemtee kaccha maal hai
 This government committee, imagining six different global conditions, has concluded that in the event of a us-china trade war, a 1% investment in GDP of India, when it became part of a large trade group like RCEP
 22 fisad or nijee khapat main 0
 73 percent increase! We do not know what happened behind closed doors in RCEP? To whose benefit did the government miss this opportunity? But according to the figures which are now in front of us, the failure of India's foreign and trade policy is also a fundamental reason for this recession
 puri tarah dhah chuki gharelu khapat ke bich tej niryaat ke bina mandi se ubarna naammumkin he or niryaat badhaane ke liye band daravaajon ko kholana hi hoga
 Those who raised the five trillion slogans should know that in recent decades, no major economy of the world has been able to achieve high growth for a long time without continuous increase in exports

 (agenciyon ke input ke saath) Dreams are a special state of mind in which there is a feeling of reality
 swapn na to jaagrit avasthaa main aate hai na to nidra main balki yah donon ke bich kii turiyavastha main aate hai
 Food and diseases play a big role in dreaming
 iske peeche grah or rashiyaan bhi jimmedaar hoti hai
 But there is no meaning of loss
 zyaadaatar sapane nirarthak hote hai
 What does Dharma Shastra say about dreams? - The meaning of dreams is told in Puranas through different incidents
 - ramcharita maanas main sapanom ke bare main vishesh charchaa kii gayi he
 Apart from this, the relation of the birth of Bhagwan Mahavir and Gautama Buddha has also been linked to dreams
 - shastron main sapanom ke alaava iske prabhaav se mukti kaa rasta bhi bataaya gaya he
 How much effect do dreams have on us? - Most dreams are born from thoughts of mind or diseases
 - is prakaar ke sapane vartmaan yabhavishyapar koi prabhaav nahin daalate yaa nunatam prabhaav daalate hai
 - Some dreams are warning forms or information formats and these dreams are really important
 - ye sapane bhavishya ke prati aapako aagaah karte hai or shubh-ashubh ghatnaon ko bataate hai
 - Dreams appearing at dawn or suddenly are usually true
 alag-alag sapanom ke arth--akaashaya hawa se sambandh rakhane vaale swapn bataate hai ki aapkaa vaat kaa santulan bigadaa hua he
 If you see dreams related to water, waterfall or river, that is water, then your phlegm is wrong
 - agar aag kaa surya kaa yaa jwalamukhi kaa sapana dikhe to bataata he ki aapkaa pitt kaa santulan gadabad he
 - The dream of lotus flower, elephant, monkey, swan and cow is considered very auspicious
 - swapn main saanp kaa dikhnaa ye bataata he ki aapaki laaparvaahee aapako mushkil main daal sakati he
 - If a person's death is seen in a dream, then it should be understood that the crisis that has come upon that person is averted
 - agar swapn main kisi vyakti ke saath yaa apane saath koi durghatana hoti hui dikhe to aapako saavdhaan ho janaa chahie
 If you dream of a festival or a party in your dream, then you should understand that you are going to get sick
 - agar swapn main swayan ko yaa kisi or ko puja paath karte dekhen to samajhnaa chahie ki aapako koi bada laabh hone vaala he
 If you see dreams related to money, jewelry, ornaments, then it is a sign of disease
 aap biimaar pad sakate hai yaa naukari ja sakati he
 - If the temples are seen by the dreams of the deities, then they give information about the rites, how your rites are
 - agar khaane pine kii chizon ke swapn dikhen to yah sthaan parivartan kaa sanket he
 If you dream of white things, it can make a complete change in your life

 Scott Walker (governor of the US state of Wisconsin) has a fantastic company in the state
 jiskaa naam harlie davidson he
 When he sends his motorcycle to India
 udhaaharan ke taur par, unhen 100 fisadi tex dena padataa he
 Now the Prime Minister (narendra Modi), whom i believe is a very brilliant person
 unhone ek din mujhe phone kiya
 He said that we are reducing the tax to 50 per cent
 maine kaha thik he, lekin ab tak hamen kuch bhi nahin mil rahaa tha
 We are not getting anything and they are getting 50 per cent tax and they are thinking that they are reducing tax like they are doing us a favor
 ye koi ehsaan nahin he
 And you know what I'm talking about
 wo ek badi or puraani company he
 When i spoke to Harley's President, he was not even saying that, because he has been suffering from this kind of trade for a long time
 wo to hairaan the ki maine is mudde ko ab uthaaya he
 i am the one who is emphasizing this issue more than that
 lekin ye bahut anyaaypurna he or bharat hamen kaaphi sankhya main motorcycle bechata he
 He has a company that does a lot of business
 unki motorcycle hamaare desh main aati he to koi tex nahin lagata
 Zero tax
 hamen zero mil rahaa he
 They are getting 100 percent tax
 wo ise 75 tak lekar aae
 Then we have brought it to 50
 acha he
 And i was not assuming it
 unhone itane sundar tareeke se apni baat kahi
 He is a very nice person
 or unhone kaha ki main aapako bataanaa chahta hum ki hamane tex ko 75 fisadi kar diya lekin ab ham ise kam karke 50 fisadi tak kar chuke hai
 And i said good
 main kya kahata
 Would i be so happy All this is not good for us
 khaastaur par governron ke liye
 this is not right
 or is tarah ke kai samjhaute hamane kar rakhe hai
 "donald Trump, US President, February 26, 2018, White houseamerican President Donald Trump thinks himself as smart as if his two number actions would not catch anyone
 kisi ke samaj main nahin aaengi
 He was speaking at the White House's business session on February 26 at the White House's governors
 jisamen wo bijnes kii baat karte hue mexico, canada, china or phir bharat kii baat karne lage
 Trump went on to explain how business deals in older governments did not fit American interests
 kaise duusare desh america kii bijnes nitiyon kaa phayda uthaate rahe hai
 But now Trump has come and is trying to make everyone straight
 isamen trump ne harlie davidson naam kii motor cycle company kaa udhaaharan dete hue bharat kaa naam liya
 In which Donald Trump mentioned an alleged phone call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his speech
 trump ne kaha ki harlie davidson bharat main bike bechati he to bharat 100 fisadi tak tex lagaataa tha
 While the US does not levy any tax on bikes coming from India
 bharat kii bike company america main khub paise kamaati he lekin hamen kuch nahin miltaa
 Trump claimed that Modi called and told that he was reducing the tax to 50 per cent, to which he said it is fine
 trump apane governron ke bich ye bataanaa chaah rahe the ki dekho in deshon ko kaise main thik kar rahaa hum
 And they are also trying to tell that this is just the beginning, yet to be corrected because they have not done any favor by reducing tax
 trump ne apni political scoring karne main ye bataaya ki harlie davidson jaise companiyon ko chalaane vaale to hairaan ho rahe hai ki wo to lambey vakt se ye sab jhel rahe hai, or kaise trump ne ye mudda uthaaya he
 Trump did not stop to say that he is also the only person who is emphasizing the issue
 baaki kya companiyaan kya puraane netaa or sarkarein sab ise sah rahi thim
 But Trump spoke sarcastically at the Prime Minister of India in his political scoring
 trump is tarah kii baat isse pehle bhi kar chuke hai
 In which there were reports of imitating the manner of speaking of his Prime Minister Modi
 26 farvari ke trump ke bhaashan main bharat vaale hisse ko dekhen or sunen to usamen bhi trump isi tarah se haath baandhakar awaz ke utaar chadhaav se nakal utaarne or kataaksh karne main lage the, ye saaf dikh jayega
 The question is why did Trump talk about the Prime Minister of India in terms of tax twice a month
 isamen harlie davidson company kaa hi naam kyon liya?13 farvari ko isi tarah kii baat donald trump white house main america saansadon ke saamne kar chuke the
 In which he also mentioned his phone call without naming Modi and told how India has agreed to reduce import duty on Harley Davidson bike
 8 farvari ko ye bataaya gaya tha ki narendra modi or donald trump ke bich phone par baat hui he
 But the main purpose of this phone call was stated to be a conversation on the situation in Maldives and Afghanistan
 iske chaar din baad 12 farvari ko bharat ke central board of excise and customs ne notification jari kiya jisamen ye kaha gaya ki mahange brands kii emported lakjri motorcycle par emport duty ko kam karke 50 fisadi kar diya gaya he
 Earlier, bikes with engines of more than 800 cc capacity had 75 per cent tax
 lekin donald trump ehsaan jataane ke bajaay bharat ke pradhanmantri par agar kataaksh kar rahe hai, or badi chaturaai se iske bahaane main america main apni netagiri ke number badhaane main lage hai to sawaal ye he ki kya bharat trump kii is tarah kii harakat kaa koi sidhaa yaa phir usee chaturaai se jawaab degaa
 Because for the first time when Trump did such a thing, the Indian government did not respond
 rahi baat harlie davidson kii to uske bijnes par trump ne america sansad ke andar farvari 2017 main pehali baar zikr kiya tha
 It was only a few weeks when he became president
 tab unhone saavdhaneepurvak bharat kaa naam nahin liya tha
 Trump was highly praised in the US for manufacturing, citing Harley Davidson as an example
 lekin 31 janvari 2018 aate aate ye khabar aa gai ki harlie davidson apni girti hui bikri kii vajah se america main mizori ke kainsaas city kaa plant band karne ja rahaa he
 Which will create 800 jobs
 harlie davidson kii america main bikri gir gai
 Harley's business now rests on foreign countries
 ye trump ab tab jo baaten karte rahe hai, unke khilaaf jaati hai
 So when Harley Davidson announced on 31 January that he was starting to close a plant in the US, then in the next few days, Trump continued to talk to India about Harley Davidson
 jisamen unhone pehle 13 farvari ko america saansadon ke saamne bina bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa naam liye unke phone kaa sanket diya or is tarah kaa ishaara diya ki dekho, mere kehane par bharat ne emport duty kam kar di or khud bharat ke pradhanmantri ne phone kiya
 The phone and the conversation which took place between Trump and Modi on 8 February and said that the matter was in the case of Maldives and Afghanistan
 iske baad trump chup nahin baithe
 For his accolades, he again referred to his Prime Minister's call at the White House on 26 February in front of the governors of his state, saying that even though he reduced the import duty on Harley Davidson, Trump would bring it to zero
 ye baaten karne main trump ne jo kahana chaha ki bharat ke pradhanmantri ne phone karke jo badi chaturaai se baat kii or kaha ki tex gata diya, jaise koi ehsaan kar rahe hai
 These things are very insulting
 jiskaa kaisaa jawaab dena chahie
 The Indian government must decide this, because if the answer is not found, Trump has done such a thing twice
 unke bare main duniya jaanati he
 They will not stop if they are not interrupted
 *** Take a look at this strange pair — on one side there is 39-year-old Farhan Akhtar, a rich-bodied, urban filmmaker and actor peeping through modern clothing, while on the other is sitting 78-year-old slim-skinned athlete Milkha Singh, dressed in a suit and turban
 
 ek apane kariyar ke shikhar par he to doosraa dashakon pehle apane kariyar ko alavida kah chukaa he
 Despite this, both of them are seeing their own image in each other today
 apni-apni field ke ye donon diggaj milakar aapke liye vibhaajan, dangon, khun-kharabe, haar or jeet kii ek kahani lekar aae hai, jiskaa naam he bhaag milkha bhaag
 These true events of Milkha Singh's life are drenched in such a dramaticness that could not have been imagined through a screenplay
 unka janm 1935 main faisalabad main hua tha, jo ab pakistan main he
 Milkha became a member of the riots during Partition
 ve bharat chale aae or garibi se upji jindagi kii tamaam dushwariyon ke peeche daud lagaate hue 1952 main bhartiya fouj main shaamil ho gaye
 In his eyes, this was where Milkha Singh, the athlete who broke the record under the supervision of Havildar Gurdev Singh, was born
 milkha 1956 main patiala or 1958 main katak main yojit rashtriya khelon main daude, jahaan unhone 200 meter or 400 meter kaa record todaa or usee saal unhone asian khelon or rashtramandal khelon main gold medal bhi jite
 In Pakistan in 1962, he defeated Abdul Khalik, the favorite runner of the people there, while the then Pakistani President Ayub Khan gave him the title of Flying Sikh
 khalik tokyo asian khelon main 100 meter daud ke swarnapadak vijeta rah chuke the
 What happened next is history
 kehete hai ki stadium ke janaana hisse main baithi auraton ne victory lap ke dauraan milkha kii jhalak paane ke liye apane burke tak uthaa die the
 Milkha believes that the film will immortalize him as a hero
 farhaan ne is film main saare stant khud kiye hai
 He says that it took him two years to get into the flying Sikh spirit
 unhone sprint coach melvin cresto or physical trainer samir jora kii dekh-rekh main training lee or bandra ke saint stenislavs hyskool ke trek par lagaataar daude
 Jaura trained Farhan for over 13 months and helped him gain 10 kg
 un khaas drishyon ke liye farhaan ko hafte main paanch din sirf liquid diet par rakhaa gaya, jisase ki mansapeshiyaan acchhee tarah se dikhne lagen
 Farhan also went to train at a high place like Ladakh
 is tarah se unka sharir sadha hua ho gaya, jisamen paanch fisadi se bhi kam charbi thi or dam zyada tha
 Farhan had to lose more than 14 kg to look like the young Milkha

 mere bete jeev ne rang de basanti dekhi thi or kaha tha, ''papa, agar aapaki kahani hamen deni hogi to ham rakesh (omprakash mehara) ko hi denge
 "many directors offered me money to make a film, but we didn't want to sell ourselves

 i gave the whole story to Rakesh

 If someone believes in himself and works hard, he will kiss the sky
 aapako farhaan akhtar main apana aks dikhataa he?milkha singhunke sharir kii banaavat, chaal or daudaahe kaa style bilkul mere jaisaa he
 They did everything the same way i did
 maine unhen dikhaaya tha ki main shuruyaat kaise karata tha, kaise main pahaad ke upar daudta or ret main daudta tha or maine kaise wet (vajan) training lee
 Farhan said that he used to be an athlete in school
 isliye unhone itani jaldi sab kuch pakad liya
 No one can say that he is not Milkha Singh
 farhaan, kya aap milkha singh hai?farhaan akhtar(hansate hue) haa, main hum, or aap bhi hai
 Everyone has a Milkha lion inside
 aap donon bilkul alahada shaks hai
 One of the cities is urban and the other is earth red
 farhaan, is kairactor ko nibhaana kitna mushkil rahaa?farhaan akhtarayahi to chunauti he ki aap apane confort jone se baahar kaise nikalate hai
 Such occasions are also rare
 ve isi tarah ke ek durlabh shaks hai
 i am thankful for this opportunity
 rakesh or meri mulaakaat agast, 2011 main hui thi or unhone 25 minute main hi mujhe puri kahani suna daali thi
 i was familiar with Milkhaji's achievements, but was surprised to learn how he did so much and how he gave up
 bahut logon ko ye baaten nahin pataa
 Within 10 minutes of hearing the story, i had decided that i would do this film
 kahani bhaavnaatmak rup se aapako jodatii he or jhkjherti he
 i felt that this film should be made and i feel proud to be a part of it
 jab maine tay kiya ki main yah film karuunga, to maine vaada kiya ki is role ko karne ke liye jo kuch karnaa hoga, main karne ko taiyaar hum
 They should feel like i have justice with the roll
 aapako us samay kaisaa laga jab farhaan ko aapkaa role nibhaane ke liye chunaa gaya?milkha singhfarhaan trek par mere style ko pakadaaey ke liye ghanton bitaayaa karte the
 Today when i look at Farhan, it seems that Milkha has been reborn
 in logon ne to mujhe amar kar diya he

 jab kabhi main koi daud jitkar aata tha to mere faujee dost akasar mujhe apane kandhon par uthaa lete or bhangada karne lagate the, chaahe unhen aata ho yaa nahin
 You were saying that the new generation does not know you
 
 
 milkha singhmein media or cricket ko doshi maanata hum
 i am not against cricket as a sport but it is ruling the country
 media choubison ghante cricket dikhaata he, akhbaar cricketron kii tasveeron se bhare rahete hai
 The rest of the games are bypassed
 is film kaa sandesh he ki agar aapako shoharat chahie, to aapako apana sab kuch jhaankna hoga
 Do you think that cinema is the best medium to spread this message? Farhan Akhtar i always feel that the most powerful mass media to connect ideas to people is cinema
 aaj kii peedi ke paas itnaa dhairya nahin he ki vah lambey samay tak bhaashan sune
 If they are shown something emotionally and excitingly, they understand the message better
 iskaa istemaal bahut prabhaavshaalee tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he
 Milkha Singhfilm will carry a good message among the people
 mata-pita apane bacchon se kahenge ki dekho, ''aise bana tha milkha sih
 "how difficult was your training? Farhan Akhtarmeeri was devoted to this film for two years of his life
 daud ke seen australia, canada or dakshin africa ke asli dhavakon ke saath shoot kiye gaye
 i did not want them to think with whom we are being run
 ” mere liye yah jaruri tha ki daud shuru hone ke baad athlete actor ko na pahchaan saken
 i focused on the fact that if they could work so hard to achieve their goals, then i too had to do my best to get justice with this role
 milkha singhek athlete ko mushkil training se guzarana padataa he or yah uski dincharya main hota he
 i know how many times i came close to death
 training ke dauraan kai baar mujhe oxigen tak deni padi thi
 i did not know if i would survive or not, but the encouraging voices of the people raised me
 aise mushkil halaat se guzar kar main kaamyaab hua
 It is a big responsibility to make a film on a living great human being! Farhan Akhtarbasak
 yaa to us jimmedaari ke tale dab jaaenge yaa phir uske sahare udaye lagenge
 Milkha Singh: a baby boy can become anything
 koun jaanata he ki agar main fouj main nahin aayaa hota to dakait ban jaataa
 i give all the credit to the army

 Is there any other concern other than this film, through which his vision can be brought to the fore? Farhan Akhtarmilkhaji runs a foundation with which we will have a relationship
 milkhaji chaahate hai ki nai peedi apni takat ko pahachaane
 Not just for personal prestige but for a greater purpose
 milkha singhmein chahta hum ki log yah mahasoos karen ki ham desh ke liye kuch bhi kar sakate hai
 Milkha, do you think this recognition has come too late? Milkha Singhmuj i got the Padma Shri in 1958 after winning gold in the Commonwealth
 phir 2001 main jaakar mujhe arjuna puraskaar diya gaya, jise maine lene se inkaar kar diya
 The government was disappointed, but i do not care for all this
 mujhe vah mat do jiskaa main hakdaar hi nahin
 The prize list he put me in was filled with ineligible people
 farhaan, kya ab aap athlete ke taur par kariyar banane ke bare main soch rahe hai?farhaan akhtar(hansate hue) aisa koi plan nahin! is role ko karne main mujhe majaa aayaa

 Once a man was asked by Socrates, what is the secret of success
 sucraat use nadi kinare le gaye or bole ki safalataa kaa raaj nadi main he isliye andar chalo to tumhen khud hi pataa chal jaayegaa
 The man entered the river with Socrates, when the water reached the neck, the man said, now tell me how you can get success
 sucraat ne uski gardan pakadi or nadi main dubo di or khud uske kandho par baith gaye
 The man tried to remove them but he failed to remove the powerful Socrates from himself
 jab vah aadmi bilkul doobane vaala tha use lagane laga ki vah to is pagal sucraat ke haathon maaraa jaayegaa 
 
 
 So, putting all his strength, he dropped Socrates and started shouting, "what is the way?

 During the conclave held at Lord's (london) on Sunday, Wasim Akram said that when Sachin stepped into international cricket, on his first tour of Pakistan, we thought that this little kid came to play cricket

 Akram said, Although i saw that Sachin gave our best leg spinner of that time, Abdul Qadir, 3 or 4 sixes in an over, then it came to know that there is something special in this boy and he is one of the best batsmen in the world
 Will be sachin tendulkar ne kaha ki lords se bahut puraani yaaden judi hai
 He said that when i joined the team for the first time, i first learned Punjabi
 sachin ne kaha ki jab main 16 saal kaa tha tab test cricket main shuruyaat main wasim ne mujhe chaar gend bounsar maari, tab mujhe pataa chalaa ki shuruyaat aise hi hoti he
 Sachin said that i thought it was all over here
 jab main out hokar waapas ja rahaa tha tab main bahut maayoos tha
 i went to the washroom and saw myself in the mirror and thought that everything was going to end here
 saath hi main yah bhi soch rahaa tha ki kaash mujhe ek mauka or mil jaae

 unhone ravishankar prasad ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'aap ise vyangy main lenaa
 Looking at you, it looks like you will do my encounter
 iske jawaab main ravishankar prasad ne kaha, 'ham aapke vyangy ko bhi gambhirtha se lete hai
 Owaisi said in retaliation, "your face is telling that you will eat me
" aadhaar bill asanvaidhanik he
 Even if you pass this bill in the Lok Sabha, it will not be able to stand before the Supreme Court
 'owesi ne kaha, 'is bill ke kai praavdhaan supreme court ke adeshon kaa ulanghan karte hai
 This is a classic example of Halala, as the Supreme Court has said that government data cannot be given to private companies
 isse sarkaar or privet companiyon ke bich shaadi tut gai he or yah halaala kaa clasik cese ban chukaa he
 Owaisi said the government is dancing to the gestures of private companies and has no concerns about privacy protection

 No compromise will be made with this
 unhone kaha ki aaj aadhaar par vaishvik str par charchaa ho rahi he
 Aadhar scheme is being praised all over the world
 aise main congress ko bhi aadhaar par yakeen karnaa chahie or protsaahit karnaa chahie
 This bill has been amended to make Aadhaar voluntary with full security
 vahiin, congress netaa adheer ranjan choudhary ne kaha ki aadhaar kaa shrey modi sarkaar lene kii koshish kar rahi he, jabaki aadhaar or diarect benifit transfar (DBT) upie sarkaar kaa brain child hai
 He said, 'it is true that Parliament is supreme, but there is a smell from the speech of Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad that the decision of Parliament should not be taken to court
 yah sahi nahin he
 He said, 'we want it to be smart and fit
 isliye isko select cameti ko bheja janaa chahie
