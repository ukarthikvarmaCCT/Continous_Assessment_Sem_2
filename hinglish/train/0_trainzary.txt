 karnataka main raajnneetik ghamaasan machaa hua he
 BS Yeddyurappa took the oath of Chief Minister on Thursday and today the Supreme Court has fixed the deadline to prove majority on Saturday, ie on Saturday, instead of 15 days
 bijepi ko bahumat sabit karne ke liye 8 atirikt vidhayakon kii jarurat he
 In such a situation, Congress and JDS are trying to protect their mlas from the bjp's camp
 karnataka ke raajnneetik halaat ko dekhte hue koi bhi dal risk nahin lenaa chahta
 The BJP is trying to unite the legislators for a majority
 is samay ek-ek vidhayak par congress ne paharaa laga rakhaa he
 Because the disappearance of any MLA can change the picture of Karnataka
 yediurppa ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke saath hi karnataka main congress or jedies ko apane vidhayakon kii suraksha kaa khatra mandaraane laga he
 Both parties first sought a chartered plane to transport the mlas to safe havens, but when the arrangements could not be made, in such a situation the buses of the leader closest to them were resorted to
 congress ne iske liye apane vafaadaar transporter deepi sharma bas services par hi vishwaas jataayaa
 The Congress and JDS transported their mlas to Hyderabad by buses from Sharma Bus Services
 dakshin bharat kii pramukh he sharma bas sarvisadakshin bharat sharma transports kaaphi pramukh he
 Buses of Sharma Transports run in many cities
 congress ke vidhayakon ko bachaane vaali sharma transport company ko rajasthan se aae dhanraj sharma ne shuru kiya tha
 Currently, his son Sunil Kumar Sharma runs
 ye bas services bengalooru se mumbai, pune, ahmadabad, chennai, hyderabad, goa ke bich chalati he
 Congress connection of Sharma Bus Service, tell us that Dhanraj Sharma was active in South politics since 1980
 pehle unhone real stel kaa vyapaar shuru kiya tha
 With this, he tried his luck in politics
 dhanraj sharma ne 1998 main congress tikat par south bangalore kii loksabhaa seat se chunaav bhi lade the, lekin wo jeet nahin sake the
 He was defeated by Ananth Kumar of BJP
 sharma purv pradhanmantri pivi narsimha raav, rajeev gandhi or indira gandhi ke kareebi bhi bataae jate hai
 Dhanraj Sharma died in 2001
 maujuuda samay main sharma transport ko sunil sharma sambhaal rahe hai
 What is the party position now? Elections have been held for 222 seats in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly
 yani bahumat ke liye 112 siton kii jarurat hogi
 104 BJP mlas have won
 jedies ke 37 or congress ke 78 vidhayak or 3 anya jeet kar aae hai
 That is, BJP will still need 8 mlas to prove majority
 lekin jedies ke kumaraswami do siton se jitkar vidhayak bane hai
 In such a situation, he will have to resign from one seat
 to phir 221 seat ke lihaaj se bijepi ko 111 siton kii jarurat padegi bahumat sabit karne ke liye 
 The Aam Aadmi Party has filed a complaint against the Lieutenant Governor (LG) Najeeb Jung in the Anti Corruption Branch (ACB)
 un par parole maamle main haryana ke purv mukhyamantri omprakash chautaala ko phayda pahunchane ke liye pad kaa durupyog karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 LG rejected the allegation, however, that the Lieutenant Governor's Office has dismissed these allegations
 saath hi daawa kiya tha ki ye aarope isliye lagaae gaye hai kyonkielji ne mukhyamantri arvind kejarivalsahit aap netaaon ke khilaaf darj 24 maamle waapas lene se manaa kar diya tha
 Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain had asked to withdraw this case
 ye maamle vibhinn adaalaton main lambit hai
 In a letter to the ACB, you have written to the ACB chief accusing Chautala of allegedly benefiting each other in the parole case and demanded an inquiry into the role of the Lt
 Governor in the case
 patr par aap netaa ashutosh, dilli ikai ke sanyojak dilip pandeya or koshadhyaksh raghav chaddha ke hastakshar hai
 In this letter written, it has been said in this letter that the post of Lieutenant Governor is constitutional
 unhone may 2015 or oktober 2015 donon baar chautaala ko laabh pahunchane ke liye apane pad kaa durupyog kiya
 The Lt
 Governor's personal, rather bizarre intervention in an unregulated case of parole request is an attempt to benefit an accused

 a video of blatant Sonam Kapoor is becoming very viral these days on social media sites
 culture mashin media privet limited ne apane utyub channel 'beeing indian' par ek or nayaa video aplod kiya he, jiskaa naam rakhaa gaya he sonam selfi
 In this video, Sonam's recent interview with Koffee with Karan has been included in a very funny manner
 video main sonam kii dher sari selfi or isi tarah kii duusari tasveeron ko dikhaaya gaya he or becoground main sonam kaa trademark 'you no vat ai min' goonjata rahata he
 This funny video also includes Sonam's statement in 'koffee with Karan' in which she is saying that looking ordinary does not mean that you are a good actor
 sonam ne kaha tha, 'sirf isliye ki aap saadhaaran dikhte hai or laud acting karte hai, aap achche actor nahin ho jate
 This is nonsense'
 sonam ke is video par log jamkar coment kar rahe hai
 Some are making fun of them and some are protecting them
 ek yujar ne to sonam kii khinchaai karte hue likhaa he, 'bechaari sonam! main kisi kii khinchaai ko protsaahan nahin detaa
 But still this song is not worse than Sonam's entire interview '
 to ek anya yujar ke mutabik, 'is video se saaf ho jaataa he ki sonam ek mahatvapurn shakhsiyat hai'
 At the same time, this video has been taken very lightly by Sonam Kapoor
 unhone kaha ki unhen apana yah selfi song bahut pasand aayaa he

 Apart from all this, there has been a lot of controversy about wechat Chinese instant messaging due to data security

 sachin tendulkar ke 100wein shatak ke baad kuch rochak ghatnaayen ghatin
 The moment that the cricket world had been waiting for a long time, immediately came the moment after which the cricket world was waiting for it with equal vigor
 vah kshan tha-sachin ke kuch kehane kaa
 After this he finally spoke again
 jab koi itani mahatvapurn baat hui ho, tab aisi baat karnaa bahut chota, bahut ochhaa hoga
 But wait a bit
 kyonki isi ochhepan main kisi or zyada mahatvapurn cheez kii buniyaad chhipi ho sakati he
 Soon after that unprecedented feat against Bangladesh, Tendulkar was as polite and as seductive as he always is at the press conference
 mike haath main lene ke baad unki vinamrata balle ke saath unki mahanata se puri tarah mail khaati he
 They deny that they are any god, as they often do
 unhone is baat ko saamne rakhaa ki ve har drushti se sirf ek insaan hai, or yah ki unke 99 or 100wein shatak ke bich main 369 dinon kaa jo antar rahaa he, vah lagaataar unhen is baat kii yaad dilaataa rahaa he ki teen ankon kaa score insaan ke liye kitna mahatvapurn ho saktaa he
 He admitted that like all of us, he was extremely upset about his inability to reach this score first
 iske baad, ascharyajanak rup se, yah baat fail gai ki sachin dobaaraa bolenge
 It was barely 12 hours, but the reporters reached the place mentioned, well before the stated time, so that the questions could be answered by the Little Master
 jab tendulkar jaisaa koi shaks saamne ho, to thodi bahut bhi khushaamad na karnaa asambhav ho jaataa he
 It is rare to find another of their collision, that of a person who has attained a level of greatness far beyond most people
 aisi baat man main na aane dena asambhav he ki kisi siddh purush kii tarah unhone khel ke gyaan kaa zyada ooncha str praapt kar liya he, or yah ki agar aapako unase poochne ke liye sahi sawaal nahin milte, to vah khud hi aapako koi ishaara de sakate hai ki vahaan tak kaise pahunchaa jaae
 He was in casual clothes, someone presented him a cake, ate a piece of cake he was given, and as usual, he was very polite and ready to answer any questions
 is athmiya jamghat par patrkaar siddharth rabindran ne ek choti-si report yah kehete hue likhi he ki pehle kii press conferencon ko agar alag rakh diya jaae, to tendulkar ne pichley ek varsh se media se baat nahin kii he
 His conclusion was, 'it was a matter of 15 minutes and dragged on for 20 minutes, and the media manager ended the conversation after that
 jo ummid kar rahe the ki england or australia ke haathon hui haar, yaa yahaan tak ki 18 march ko pakistan ke khilaaf hone vaale ahm match ke bare main tendulkar ke vichaar jane ja sakenge, ve niraash hue
 Before leaving, several journalists, including those who had recently questioned the question of retaining Sachin in the team, lined up to take autographs
 ’kai bade masale the jinka samaadhaan jaruri tha
 The question of senior players is starting to get uncontrolled
 sachin ke yah mile kaa pathar kaayam karne ke kuch din pehle hi rahul dravid ne sammanjanak dhang se sanyas le liya
 However, no one was invited to greet Dravid on his departure
 thik usee tarah, jaise is samasya kaa samaadhaan khojane ke liye kisi ko nimantran nahin diya gaya he ki dravid ke jamaane ke 'shor machaate terminetaron' kii jagah un yuvaaon par kis dhang se nirbhar hua jaae, jo ab team main apni jagah kii maang karne lage hai
 Nobody dared to ask the question of whether there was solidarity or not in the team
 australia main yah to adhikansh log jaan gaye the ki tendulkar ne 100waan shatak bana liya he, lekin iskaa ehsaas kam hi logon ko tha ki aisa karnaa haar kii ek vajah bana, yaa is baat kaa ki dhimi gati us kaaran kaa hissaa thi, jis kaaran bharat bangladesh se match haar gaya
 This milestone overshadowed every sensible review of the team's performance
 or is baat main ek bahut badi chintaa chhipi hui he
 No player should ever be allowed to dominate the team, but this has happened on many levels
 agar yah sahi he ki tendulkar ko bhi bharat kii haar ke liye aanshik taur par jimmedaar mana janaa chahie, to bhi bharat kii vifaltaaon kii jimmedaari un par akele nahin daali jaani chahie
 It is suspected that many times in Australia, as the milestone draws closer, their batting gets stuck, and that their attention is diverted from their own score, not the team's score, but a big one
 The issue was left
 unke anmane mile ke pathar ko lekar lagaai gai ummiido ke bare main baat karte hue tendulkar ne kaha, ‘kaash! aisa koi hota, jo mujhe raah bataata ki isse kaise nibata jaae
 'when Team India started to falter in Australia and finally collapsed, maybe even Sachin didn't know what to do
 maaikel atharaton nakaaratmak tippanee halke andaaj main nahin karte hai, lekin ve us asar kii aalochana karne ke liye majaboor hue, jo asar ek nijee uplabdhi ne tendulkar ke khel par daalaa tha
 He wrote in The Times of London, 'the wait has not only started getting tired, but it is also creating a negative image on Tendulkar himself and on the question of what is motivating him to keep playing
 khel khilne ke kai kaaran hai, lekin jaisaa ki (ian) chapel ne kaha he, mukhya kaaran apni team ko match jeetne main madad karne kii koshish karnaa hi hona chahie
 The remaining reasons — financial reasons, challenges and personal data — should only come after this
 tendulkar ke haal ke sangharsh se ek aise vyakti kaa sanket miltaa he, jo apane or apni team ke hit ko lekar apane str par zyada hi rama hua he
 For the last one year, it has been as if the Indian team is hanging in the balance and Tendulkar is staring at his special achievement
 ’ england or austrailia ke daure anarthakaari rahe
 There was a lot of talk on the problems faced by the batsmen in keeping pace with the local conditions, but no such excuse can be made for not reaching the final of the Asia Cup
 tendulkar un logon main se nahin hai, jo aasaani se netritv sambhaal sakate hon
 We know that many years ago he left the captaincy to focus on his own game
 ve swaarthee insaan bhi nahin hai, lekin samay kii maang he ki ve apni sahuuliyat ke daayre se baahar nikalen
 Even after hearing all the things, seeing his magnificent achievements, there is a desire to fall speechless at his feet
 khaas taur par tab, jab aap yah bhi dekhen ki un par ummiido kaa kitna baari boj hota he or unke har kadam ke saath kitni shraddha judi hoti he
 Tendulkar is ahead of players born once in a generation
 ve ek sadi main ek baar paidaa hone vaale khilaadi hai
 But now it is time to think about generations and generations of change

 Former Delhi minister PK Thungan has been sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment by a Delhi court in a corruption case filed in 1998 on charges of embezzlement of central funds of two crore rupees

 The CBI counsel had told the court that Thungan committed the crime despite holding high positions like Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh and Minister of State at the Center

" teen anya mujarimon ne is sajeesh main unki madad kii isliye unhen bhi dand milanaa chahie
 Four more cases against Thungan are still pending
 " At the same time, Thungan's lawyer argued before the court that all other cases against his client are related to the same FIR lodged by the CBI in the alleged housing scam and Thungan is the only one to take care of his ailing wife suffering from several serious ailments

 jabaki sarkaar ne istife kii maang ko asweekaar karte hue kaha ki vah sushamaa, vasundhara se jude vivaad ko lekarsadanamen kisi bhi rup main or kisi bhi samay charchaa ke liye taiyaar he

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday has again targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged that the Prime Minister has made the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) the office of the Minister of Publicity for his own marketing
 iske alaava rahul ne berogari or notebandi sahit vibhinn muddon ko lekar modi par jam kar prahaar kiye
 Rahul also wondered whether the Prime Minister had ever studied university
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki modi sarkaar par shaikshik sansthaanon kaa bhagavakaran karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 Actually, during a dialogue with students in Manipur's capital Imphal and addressing a public meeting in which Rahul raised the issue of Citizenship Amendment Bill and accused him of attacking the culture of the people of the Northeast
 gauratlab he ki bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha tha ki agar bhaajapa kii sarkaar dobaaraa banati he to naagarikta vidheyak ko sansad main dobaaraa pesh kiya jayega
 Lashing out at this, Gandhi called it an attack on the culture of the Northeast
 unhone raily main kaha ki ''bijepi ke party adhyaksh amit shah kehete hai ki manipur tathaa purvottar ke logon par naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak thopa jayega
 These people are attacking your culture
 lekin hamane yah vidheyak paarit nahin hone diya
 Congress will protect your culture and will not allow the Bill to be passed
 ''congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki modi ne jab luk east kii jagah act east kii baat kiya, to unki kathani or kerani main antar saaf najar aa rahaa tha
 During the interaction with the students, Rahul said that "the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has now become the office of the Minister of Publicity"
 '' unhone aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri modi ne har saal do karod naukariyaan dene kaa vaayada karne ke baavjood akele 2018 main ek karod naukariyaan khatm kar deen
 Addressing the public meeting, he said that during the tenure of the Modi government, about 30 thousand jobs were lost every day during 2018
 gandhi ne aarope lagaaya ki 2018 main pradhanmantri modi ne desh main ek karod naukariyaan khatm kar deen
 This is their level of incompetence
 rahul ne modi kaa do karod naukariyon kaa vaayada betuka or haasyaaspad bataaya
 During the interaction with the students, the Congress president claimed that no one knows whether Modi ever studied in the university or not
 unhone kaha ki ''ham ab tak unki vishvavidhyalay kii degree ke bare main nahin jaanate
 In reality, no one knows whether he went to university or not ''
 dilli main ek artiai aavedan ke jariye pradhanmantri kii degree kii jaankaree maangi gai lekin jawaab nahin mila
 In a civilized country, the Prime Minister is talking about mediocrity
 rahul ne zikr karte hue kaha ki manipur vishvavidhyalay main pichley saal chaatro or praadhyaapakon ne kathith shaikshik virdohi gatividhiyon ko lekar tatkaaleen kulapati e pi pandeya ko pad se hataane kii maang kii thi jiske kaaran vahaan ashaanti faili thi
 Rahul said that he was happy that the people of Manipur managed to remove him
 bataa den ki pandeya par aresas se sambandhon kaa aarope laga tha
 And the Manipur University was closed for about three months due to the ongoing protest to remove them
 aresas kaa paroksh sandarbh dete hue unhone kaha ki unhen (pandeya ko) aap par thopa gaya tha
 Now the only qualification to run a university is wearing halfpants, waving sticks and spreading hatred
 notebandi ko haasyaaspad bataate hue congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki ek subah modi so kar uthe or notebandi karne kaa faisla kar liya or logon kii jindagi bikhar kar rah gai
 Is it a joke rahul ne kaha ki har rajya kii apni alag aawaaj he or use suna janaa chahie tathaa uskaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 He further said that the ideological battle is going on
 ''aresas-bhaajapa na to dusron ke vichaar sunati he or na hi un par vichaar karti he
 In contrast, the Congress knows the uniqueness of every state and values their place in the country
 '' unhone yah bhi jaananaa chaha ki purvottar ko dakshin asia or bharat ke bich sethu banane ke liye centre ne kya kiya he
 Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has overthrown the speculation of summoning Prime Minister Narendra Modi on demonetisation
 shuukravaar ko cameti ne saaf kiya ki uske paas piem ko saman jari karne kaa adhikaar nahin he

 Thomas said that if the committee is not satisfied with the response of RBI Governor Urjit Patel, then a reply can be sought directly from Modi
 20 janvari ko ahm baithkpiesi ne notebandi ko lekar 20 janvari ko baithak bulaai he
 Apart from Urjit Patel, Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa and Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das will also attend this meeting
 sawaalon kii fehristais bare main piesi ne vitt mantralay or arabiai governor ko sawaalon kii fehrist bheji he
 The committee hopes that it will get answers to these questions before January 20
 meeting ke dauraan in sawaalon par vistaar se charchaa hogi

 unhone kaha ki aaj kaa din kisaan deepawali kii tarah manayega kyonki 70 saalon kii yah maang puraa kiya gaya he
 He said that no government tried to increase the support price by one and a half times the cost price, a big decision is going to be taken in the coming days to save the farmers of the country
 aapako bataa den ki shah aaj party padaadhikariyon ke saath mirzapur baithak bhi karenge

 Perhaps this was the reason that in 2014, when PM Modi was contesting Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi, on the other hand, the then Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav had chosen Azamgarh as his parliamentary seat

 # WATCH Digvijaya Singh, Congress in Bhopal: Today, people are wearing saffron clothes and raping, rapes are happening inside temples, is this our religion? Those who have defamed our 'sanatan Dharma', not even god will forgive them

 twitter
 com / psaqcd1r7p Explain that there was a gathering of saints in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh
 is samagam main mukhyamantri kamalnath ne kaha ki wo narmada or dharm ke naam par kathith bhrashtachar kii jaanch karaayenge
 There will also be a consideration for leasing saints
 sarkaar ke nirdesh par is samagam ke kartadharta computer baba bane
 He claimed that around 1000 saints from across the state participated in it
 sammelan main siem kamalnath, purv siem digvijay singh bhi maujuud the
 But on the stage, BJP became an attacker on Kamal Nath's shoes and Digvijay's statement
 santon ko sambodhit karte hue purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ne kaha bhagava pahanakar log chuuran bech rahe hai, bhagava vastra pahanakar mandir main balaatkaar ho rahaa he, hamaare sanathan dharm ko jin logon ne badnaam kiya he unhen ishwar bhi maaf nahin karegaa
 More than 1000 sadhus gathered from the conference, but the BJP saw the Chief Minister Kamal Nath's shoe from the platform and Digvijay Singh's statement
 bijepi pravaktaa rahul kothaari ne kaha sant samagam aap karte hai bulaakar santon kii bejjati karte hai, saath main kamalnath juuta dikhaakar santon kii ore baithte hai inhen santon kaa shraap lagane vaala he
 However, the sadhus and saints who attended the congregation did not find anything wrong in Digvijay's statement or shoes
 shri mahant ram giriji maharaj, baba dandawale ne kaha ki isamen kuch galat nahin he jo log bheekh maang rahe hai, chuuran bech rahe hai sarkaar unako ek kanoon banaakar teen saal tak gaushala main rakhe yaa ta guseva karenge nahin to ghar bhaag jaaenge
 Spending on this conference has also been done by the treasury of the Madhya Pradesh government, however, the government does not feel bad about spending public money in the congregation, the sadhus want to have such meetings held several times a year
 dharmik nyaas evam dharmasv vibhaag ke mantri pisi sharma ne kaha hamaara dharmasv vibhaag he, kuch kharchaa sarkaar karegi kuch bahari se hoga
 At the same time, computer Baba said that once or not once a year, there is a congregation, the whole saint society stands with the government
 ho bhi kyon naa aakhir is samagam ke liye sarkaar ne bhi koi kor kasar nahin chodi, rahane se lekar khanpan tak ke liye khaadya vibhaag ke adhikariyon ko duty par tainaat kar diya
 On this occasion, Chief Minister Kamal Nath said that 35 years ago i had said in the Lok Sabha that Anand Department should be created
 unhone santon kii maujuudagi main kaha ki sarkaar udyogpatiyon ko patta de sakati he to mandir sanchaalak ko kyon nahin
 The Congress thinks from the heart, apart from the mind, there is no need for a monk to ask for anything in the Congress government
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki sant samagam ne meraa 250 gram khun badha diya he
 Computer Baba, who was once a minister in the Shivraj government, had also sent an invitation to Shivraj Singh but he did not come
 baharhaal computer baba vaise to digvijay singh ke liye chunaav se pehle dhuni ramaae baithe the lekin unhen chunaav jita nahin paae, ab dekhnaa hoga is manch se digvijay singh ne jo kaha he wo baba or sarkaar ke liye kya nateeja laaegaa

 Zomato ne is data brich ko conform karte hue kaha, ‘hamaari security team ne paaya he ki hamaare data base se 17 million yujar record chori ho gai he
 The stolen information contains the users 'ids and hashed passwords' Can the agreement with the security of the users be justified by assuming a mistake? Is Zomato not responsible for this data leak? Shouldn't asking Zomato like Facebook be a taunt and a penalty? These are questions that you should find answers to

 in / a case of honor killing has been reported in Ghaziabad, UP
 yahaan ek beraham baap ne juthi shaan kii khatir apni beti kii galaa dabaakar hatya kar di
 The accused father was angry at the daughter's love marriage
 mritka ke bhai kii soochna par police ne aaropee pita ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The incident is of Khoda Colony of Ghaziabad
 mritka kaa naam ruukhsar (22 varsh) tha
 Rukhsar's father-in-law was just that she was in love with a young man living in the neighborhood and married her lover, against the family's kimmerji
 ruukhsar ke pita hanif ne use kaaphi samajhaayaa
 Once again on Saturday night, Haneef tried to persuade Rukhsar a lot but did not accept Rukhsar
 gusse main hanif ne ruukhsar ke dupattey se hi uskigala ghontkar hatyakar di
 Hanif's son informed the police
 jiske baad police ne hanif ko maukey se giraftaar kar liya
 Hanif is now regretting his actions after killing his daughter
 " "aap ise shadow kaa shaatir bhi kah sakate hai or shaatir kaa shadow bhi kyonki ye khabar hi kuch aisi he
 He does not say that this is going to be the first time in history
 wo baar-baar kahata he ki pehali baar ek andhaa ankhwale kaa kirdaar nibhaane ja rahaa he lekin, wo ye sach nahin bataata ki kaise ek andhe ne kai ankhwalon ko laachaar bana diya
 Thousands stole dust and lost crores of rupees
 hero par laga ghotaale kaa aaropafilm ke itihaas main ye pehali baar he jab ek andhe ne ankhwale kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 This is hundred percent true as well, but you will be surprised to know that the hero of the film, Nasser, is being dragged to court in the case of blaming the Orissa police eyeballs and the case is of crores of crores
 hairat main daal denevaale aise stant ko khud karne kaa daawa karanevaale mohammad nasir ke khilaaf dhokhadhadi ke jo maamle wo aapako hairat main pad jaayenge
 Nasir had opened the DSP (crime Branch) of Nunbanking Company, Orissa, Panda said that Nasser had formed a company five years ago called fineindi Sales Private Limited
 ye company kanpur ke pate par kholi gayi or iske founder diarector bane shadow ke sitare mohammad nasir
 The company spread its network to smaller towns and cities in states like Chhattisgarh and Orissa
 jhansa dekar thaga rupayacompany logon se ye daawa karti thi ki wo logon ke paison ko doguna, teen guna kar degi
 In this hoax, less educated people of small cities came and crores of crores were brought in the company's account 
 police kaa aarope he ki company ke account se rupee kahin or nahin balki nasir ke nijee account main jate rahe
 The police also suspect that Nasir used unaccounted money to make a hard earned money for the blood and sweat of people
 nasir par darj he dhokhadhadi kaa maamlanasir kaa bijness chal padaa tha lekin uske gorakhdhandhe kaa pataa aakhirkaar chal hi gaya
 The result was that on 17 July 2009, while Orissa was preparing to release his film Shadow, the Orissa Police registered a case against Nasir under Sahadevkhunta police station in Balasore under the Prevention and Money Circulation Act
 nasir kii company kaa khaataa sil huaihi nahin police ko ye bhi shaq hua ki karodo rupee kii moti rakam nasir ke jariye company ke khate se desh ke baahar chali gayi
 Sensing the opportunity, SP of Crime Branch wrote a letter to ICI Bank requesting to seal the account of Nasir's company

 upi ke sitapur main aadamkhor ho jane ke shaq main kutton kaa encounter kiye jane ke baad bhi bacchon par hamalon kaa silsilaa badastoor jari he
 Despite all the efforts of police, administration and forest department, the situation is not coming under control
 lihaaza ab prashasan ne encounter ke baad kutton kii nasbandi kii muhim chalaa di he
 In Sitapur, a picture suddenly went viral on social media after the news of the dogs going to hell

 aisa koi din nahin bitta jab sitapur janapad ke kisi naa kisi gaanv main achaanak shor uthta he or log lathi-danda liye anjaane or andekhee jaanavar kii taraf daud padate hai
 Sometimes people of the police and forest department also join the villagers in this run-away
 isi chakkar main kai sidhe-saadhe or bekasoor kutton kii bali chadh chuki he
 However, the administration has issued a statement claiming that it is not involved in the killing of any dog or any animal in Sitapur or inciting animal harassment
 magar kuch tasviren prashasan ke daawey kii chugali karti najar aati hai
 Policemen in the uniform are clearly seen taking the dog's life

 lekin jaanwaron ke adhikaar se judi sansthaaon ke mutabik kutton kii nasbandi se sitapur main koi bahut fark padane vaala nahin he
 The argument is also being given that when it is not sure that the attackers are dogs, then the sterilization of furs is being done
 animal rhite se jude logon kaa maananaa he ki kutton ke aatank se ghabaraaya prashasan naakaam hone ke baad hi kutton kii nasbandi karne par tul gaya he
 The administration has appealed to the people to identify the dogs and bring them to the hospital so that along with vaccination they can be sterilized
 prashasan kaa kahana he nasbandi ke baad dobaaraa kutton ko khule main chhodane main jokhim nahin he
 At present, the administration has also appealed to other organizations working for animals to help in dealing with this disaster in Sitapur district

 About a year ago today, when Amazon launched the speaker named Eeco, it may not have met the expectations of the people, but people were hoping that if some improvements were made, it could emerge as a great gadget
 is
 is kami ko puraa kiya he amejan ne ek nayaa gajet launch karke jo he amejan eco dot
 Even after direct competition with Google Home Mini, Echo Dot remains the best-selling speaker in the market at this time
 kaise karata he ye kaamiko dot keval un logon ke liye bana he jinke paas ek acha internet conection he
 This is especially for those who have to avoid hard work because in this you have to speak only to listen to the song "alexa Play Music" and the song itself will start
 chota par damadamgar dizin kii baat kii jaae to isko 10 main 10 ank die ja sakate hai
 Its small and compact design makes it very beautiful
 ise aap ghar yaa offis kahin bhi rakh sakate hai
 If seen, the eco speaker is neither so big nor heavy but it also seems to be big in front of the echo dot
 eco dot bhale hi baaki spikars ke mukaable kaaphi chota he par isamen har wo khaasiyat he jo aapako ek achche spikar main chahie hoti he
 If you want, you can also connect it to a phone or a big speaker
 fitures ke maamle main bhi ye market ke baaki spikaron se aage he
 To make a call, all you have to do is give a verbal order and the call will be done automatically
 iske liye aapako alexa ap main jaakar apana phone number or contacts link karne honge
 You do not need to write the message even for messaging
 keval bolie or baaki kaa kaam alexa kar degi
 If seen, it is better in quality, utility as well as cheaper than the rest of the speakers in the market
 par in khaasiyaton ke saath kuch khamiyaan bhi hai
 Those that cannot be ignored
 bina power conection ise chalaaya nahin ja saktaa he yani ise richarge nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Consumers traveling even after being light and small in size cannot enjoy Amazon Echo Dot
 lekin phir bhi ghar main yaa aphis main iskaa majaa to liya hi ja saktaa he

 Senior batsman Sachin Tendulkar may be rested against Australia in India's next match of the tri-series to be held on Sunday, but if the past record is seen, the move could prove to be a disadvantage for the team struggling
 pichley 22 varshon main bharat ne australia main mejabaan team ke khilaaf paanch maichon main jeet darj kii he or in sabhi main hameshaa tendulkar khele hai or unhone jeet main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 In 1991–92, India defeated Australia by a 107-run margin at Waka in Perth
 tendulkar tab 65 gend main 36 ran banaakar duusare sheersh scorer rahe the jabaki abhi mukhya chayankarta kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe ke shrikant ne 60 gend main 60 ran banaaye the
 It took 12 years for India to defeat Australia again and before that they had to face defeat in 11 consecutive matches
 varsh 2003-04 main bharat ne gaba main australia ko 19 ran se haraaya tha
 Tendulkar had scored 86 runs off 95 balls with eight fours and India scored over 300 runs
 bharat ne agle teen match 2007-08 shrinkhalaa main jite the jisaki shuruuaat melbern main hui thi
 Chasing a score of 159, India had won with five wickets in which Tendulkar was the top scorer by scoring 44 runs off 54 balls with three fours
 bharat ne iske baad lagaataar do final jitkar australia main apni pehali ek divasiy shrinkhalaa main jeet darj kii thi
 In the first final in Sydney, Tendulkar scored 117 runs with the help of 10 fours in 120 balls, which helped the Indian team reach the target of 240 runs with six wickets and 25 balls
 do din baad donon timen edilade main phir ek duusare ke aamane saamne thim
 Batting first, India scored 258 runs with Tendulkar scoring 91 off 121 balls with seven fours
 in aankadon se do baaten pataa chalati hai ki tendulkar ab bhi australia ke khilaaf match main bharat kii jeet ke liye ahm hai or duusari bhartiya team salaami ballebaajon (kisi ek salaami ballebaaj) ke aakraamak pradarshan ke bina kabhi bhi australia ko nahin haraa paayi he
 This would also have caught the eye of both the openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir
 sahvaag ne teen dauron main australia ke khilaaf 10 match khele hai
 His best performance has not been more than 37 runs
 unhone in 10 maichon main 18 ke ausat se 180 ran banaaye hai
 In contrast, Gambhir is far better than the average Sehwag
 unhone mejabaan desh ke khilaaf saat maichon main 32
 Has scored 320 runs at an average of 86
 unhone 2007-08 ke pichley daure ke dauraan sidney main australia ke khilaaf 113 ran kii shatkeey pari bhi kheli thi
 If seen between Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina and Manoj Tiwari, the experience of all these against the hosts in Australia is not more than 10 matches
 rohit sharma ne 2008 main pichhali trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke pehle final main ardhashatak jamaaya tha, unhone australia ke khilaaf saat match khele hai
 Other players have played only one match in which they have added only 37 runs
 roteshan pranali ke saath yaa iske bina bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye australia ke khilaaf bache hue lig match kaaphi chunauteepurn hi sabit honge
 The remaining three league matches against Australia will be held in Adelaide on 12 February, Brisbane on 19 February and Sydney on 26 February
 agar roteshan pranali kargar rahati he, abhi tak team prabandhan kii ranneeti ke anusaar, to tendulkar edilade match se baahar rah sakate hai or phir bristben or sidney main khelenge
 But now the time has come for the Indian team to win against them in Australia without the bat of Tendulkar
 yah baat jag jaahir he ki unka sthaan bharna kaaphi mushkil hoga lekin har ballebaaj ko apni kaabiliyat sabit karne ke liye koshish to kerani hi hogi

 com / r7kgfqcukl The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) recently created history by launching 104 satellites simultaneously but, there is a negative aspect to the mission, which is a matter of concern
 varisht antariksh vaigyanik madhavan nair kaa kahana he ki naino upgrah antariksh main kachra badha rahe hai or yah kachra sakriy upgrahon ke liye khatra ho sakate hai
 He also expressed concern that if any of the active satellites are damaged by these nano satellites, then India will have to compensate them
 isro ke purv adhyaksh ji
 During the tenure of Madhavan Nair, ISRO launched the Chandrayaan mission on the moon
 nair kaa maananaa he ki isro ke dhruviya upgrah prakshepan yaan (pieselvi) ke naveenatam mishan se antariksh main uske hi upgrahon ko kuch sambhavit khatre paidaa ho sakate hai
 Let us tell you that on February 15, ISRO left more than 100 nano and micro satellites in space, taking an amount for foreign customers
 inamen se 'dovs' naamak 88 upgrah san francisco kii ek start-ap 'planet' ke hai
 All of these small satellites, which are smaller than a briefcase, have been placed in a polar orbit 506 km above the Earth in a successful mission through PSLV
 nair ne kaha, "main thodaa chintit hum, kyonki jis sthaan par inhen sthapit kiya gaya he, yah vahi sthaan he, jahaan hamaare bhu-avlokan upgrah hai yaa honge
 " nair ne kaha ki naino upgrahon kaa upyogi jivan behad kam hota he, jiske baad ve kachra ban jate hai or antariksh main usee kaksha main ghoomte rahete hai
 Being in one place, there is a risk of them hitting isro's active satellites
 nair ne kaha, "antariksh main thode samay rahane ke baad ye naino upgrah, jo malba chhodte hai, hamaare liye khatra ban sakate hai
 The safety of our satellites is more important
 " The former ISRO chairman said in a cautionary note that isro's profit of a few million dollars from the launch of foreign nano satellites in a 500 km orbit, the potential threat to geo-observation satellites installed near their routes, present and future

 unhone yah bhi kaha ki bhavishya main in naino upgrahon main se kisi ke bhi malbe or kisi anya desh ke sakriy upgrah se takaraane kii sthiti main bharat ko isaki bharpai kerani padegi
 Nair was referring to the 'space Responsibility Resolution', which came into effect in 1972
 iske tahat upgrah chhodane vaale deshon ko apane kshetra se chode gaye upgrahon kii "antarrashtriya jimmedaari leni hogi, chaahe vah upgrah kisi bhi desh kaa ho
 " nair ne kaha ki kam samay tak upyogi rahane vaale naino upgrahon ko agar launch kiya jaae to unhen nichali kakshaon main hi sthapit kiya janaa chahie
 Any waste generated in the lower orbits of the Earth will come to the Earth due to atmospheric effects and will not pose a threat to the working satellites
 unhone kaha ki chote or naino upgrahon ke liye ek kaksha nirdhaarit karne ke is mudde ko bahari antariksh ke shantipurna upyog se sambandhit sanyukt raashtra kii samiti main uthaaya janaa chahie

 madhavan nair ke kaarykaal main isro ne chandramaa par chandrayan mishan launch kiya tha
 Nair believes that the latest mission of isro's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) could pose some potential threats to its own satellites in space
 bataa den ki isro ne 15 farvari ko videshi graahakon ke liye ek rakam lekar antariksh main 100 se adhik naino or micro upgrah chode the
 Of these, 88 satellites called 'doves' belong to 'planet', a start-up in San Francisco
 in sabhi chote upgrahon ko, jinka aakaar ek brifces se bhi chota he, pieselvi ke jariye ek safal abhiyaan ke tahat prithvi se 506 kilometre upar ek dhruviya kaksha main sthapit kiya gaya he
 "I am a little worried," said Nair, because the place where these are installed is the place where our Earth observation satellites are or will be
 " Nair said that the useful life of nano satellites is very short, after which they become garbage and rotate in the same orbit in space
 ek hi sthaan par hone ke kaaran inkaa isro ke sakriy upgrahon se takaraane kaa khatra bana rahata he
 Nair said, "these nano satellites, which leave debris after a short stay in space, can become a threat to us
 hamaare upgrahon kii suraksha zyada jaruri he
 " purv isro adhyaksh ne chetavanee bhare lahaze main kaha ki isro ko 500 kilometre kii kaksha main videshi naino upgrahon kii lonching se hone vaale kuch lakh dollar ke laabh ko, vartmaan or bhavishya main unke margo ke kareeb sthapit bhu-avlokan upgrahon ko hone vaale sambhavit khatre se naap-tol kar dekhnaa chahie
 He also said that India will have to compensate in the event of the debris of any of these nano satellites and the collision with the active satellite of another country in the future
 nair 'antariksh daayitv sankalp' kaa zikr kar rahe the, jo 1972 main prabhavi hua tha
 Under this, the countries leaving the satellite will have to "take international responsibility for the satellites released from their territory, irrespective of the country
 " Nair said that if the nano satellites which are useful for short duration are launched, they should be placed in lower orbits only
 prithvi kii nichali kakshaon main utpann hua koi bhi kachra vayumandaleey prabhaav se dharti par aa jayega or kaam kar rahe upgrahon ke liye koi khatra nahin banegaa
 He said that the issue of setting an orbit for small and nano satellites should be raised in the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space
 tippaniyan Space debris experts from various forums have supported Nair's concern

 purv rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar shivashankar menon ne kaha he ki bharat or china seemaa vivaad ko jald hal kar sakate hai kyonki donon sarkaron ke paas kisismjhautaper pahunchane ke liye majboot janadesh he or is maamle main pehle hi kaaphi kaam puraa ho chukaa he
 After speaking on the topic 'india's National Security Strategy and india-china Relations' on Monday night, Menon said while talking to the students of Peking University that the border has been largely peaceful in the last three decades and there was not a single bullet , But with horror stories in both countries, emotions are overflowing
 china ke saath seemaa vivaad ko hal karne ke liye vishesh pratinidhi kii bhoomika nibhaa chuke menon ne kaha, ‘vahaan bahut sari daraavnee kahaniyaan , khaskar internet par hai
 This is the world where we live today
 isliye ham kehete hai ki seemaa vivaad ko jitna jaldi hal kar len, utana behatar rahegaa, kyonki vivaad ke samaadhaan kaa aakhri madhyam seemaa kaa vastav main nirdhaaran he
 'during this dialogue, former Chinese negotiator Dai Binggo, who had long talks with him on the border issue, was also present with Menon
 congress sarkaar ke samay china ke sathsima muddeko hal karne ke liye vishesh pratinidhi rahe menon ne kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki ham yah kar sakate hai
 Because both countries today have a government which has a strong mandate and a very clear strategic idea about where they want to take their countries
 ’ menon ke bayaan kaa samarthan karte hue dai ne kaha, ‘nishchit taur par ham ise ratorat hal nahin kar sakate
 For the last few decades, the attack has done something, has prepared some ground
 ’china ke purv vaartakar ne kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki jab sharten behatar hongi to aaj nahin to kal seemaa vivaad kaa samaadhaan ho jayega
 The border issue is to some extent a barrier to bilateral relations
 agar ham isse sahi dhang se nipat lete hai to ham paraspar vishwaas ko badha sakate hai or dwipaksheeya sambandhon ke anukool maahaul taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Dai said, 'we have handled this area correctly
 beete dashakon main ek goli nahin chali or koi gambhir tanaav nahin upja
 We need to ensure that this continues
 ’ seemaa vivaad kii vaarta se sambandhit rahe in sheersh adhikariyon kaa bayaan us vakt aayaa he jab kuch dinon pehle hi bharat ne elaan kiya ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal is vaarta ke liye bharat ke nae vishesh pratinidhi hai
 Till now 17 rounds of talks have been held between India and China to resolve the border issue
 ab nikat bhavishya main dobhaal or unke chini samakaksh yang jiyechi ke bich 18wein daur kii baatcheet hogi
 Menon is in Beijing to join the 'north Pavilion' dialogue
 is samvaad kaa aayojan peking vishvavidhyalay ke ranneetik adhyayan santhaan kii ore se kiya ja rahaa he
 On the question of sentiment booming on both sides, Menon said that both countries need to be open about the dialogue process
 unhone kaha, ‘sarkaron ne chizon ko apane paas tak simit rakhane kii aadat paal lee he
 We need to be more open about the actual situation on the border
 ’ isse pehle samvaad ke dauraan menon ne kaha, ‘bharat-china sambandhon ke uski puri kshamta tak pahunchane main sabase bada avrodh seemaa mudda bana hua he
 It would be logical to proceed as soon as possible to reach the resolution of the boundary dispute

 com / igcw1k5jek aatank se dahale jhaveri bazaar kii suraksha kaa plan sarkari daftar main fansaa hua he
 Three years ago, the Bombay Bullion Association proposed to create a no parking zone inside the market from 9 am to 9 pm
 prastaav main paanch khaas jagahon se antry di gai thi jahaan se do kilometre ke is bazaar main log aa ja saken
 There was a demand to build five security posts at these five entry points where there was a plan to deploy armed policemen with a walkie talkie, but this proposal is now stuck in the RTO after passing from BMC
 artio kaa kahana he ki agar no parking hoga to mumbadevi or jhaveri bazaar aane vaali itani sari gaadiyaan kahaan jaaengi ? In Delhi, the Kejriwal government has filed its affidavit in the High Court on a petition for reducing the age of alcoholism
 dilli sarkaarne maamle main apana paksh rakhte hue kaha kisharab pine kii umr25 saal se kam nahin honi chahie, kyonki agar isko kam kiya gaya, to nattejey khatarnaak ho sakate hai
 It can have a negative impact on young people and can harm their health

 Recently, the Metro had increased fares, which was strongly opposed by many circles, including the Delhi government

 The number of passengers traveling in the metro daily reduced to 24 in the month of October
 2 lakh par aa gai

 4 lakh musafir rojaanaa metro se safar karte the
 In this way, there has been a decrease of about 11 percent in the number of passengers
 dilachasp baat yah he ki metro line ke network badhane ke baavjood yatriyon ke sankhya main kami ai he
 The decision to increase the fare was implemented only on 10 October
 dilli metro ne paanch maheene pehle hi kiraye main kareeb 100 pratishat kii vruddhi kii thi
 In response to the RTI from DMRI, the number of passengers traveling in the busy Blue Line has decreased by 30 lakhs
 iske saath hi yelo line par bhi 19 lakh yatri ghate hai
 The Yellow Line Corridor connects Samaypur Badli in North Delhi to Gurugram

 Delhi Metro had decided to increase fares on 10 October
 bade hue kiraye ke baad adhiktam kiraaya 60 rupe or nunatam kiraaya 10 rupe kiya gaya tha
 Now to travel 2 km in metro, you have to pay 10 rupees fare
 vahiin 2 se 5 kimi tak 15 rupye kii jagah 20 rupye or 5 se 12 kimi tak 20 rupye kii jagah 30 rupye kharch karne honge
 Not only this, instead of 30 rupees from 12 to 21 km, 40 rupees, 40 rupees from 21 to 32 km has become 50 rupees
 32 kimi se adhik safar karne ke liye 50 rupye kii jagah 60 rupe kiraaya dene pad rahe hai
 Due to the acute shortage in DTC, commuters travel by metro every day, so that they did not have to deal with road jams and buses
 saath kii puri tarah automatic hone kii vajah se metro main kharabi or deree ke maamle main kam hi darj hote hai
 Now the decision to increase fares has become a crisis for the metro
 pratidin agar itani badi sankhya main yatri metro chhod anya sansadhano se safar kar rahe hai to isse na sirf metro ko ghaataa hoga balki dilli main pradooshan par niyantran karnaa bhi mushkil ho saktaa he

 The controversy over the installation of a statue of Lord Rama's younger brother Laxman near the mound with mosque in Lucknow is increasing
 manyataon ke mutabik lakhanu ko lakshmana kii nagari mana jaataa he or yahaan puratathvik rup se lakshmana ke tile kaa ek zikr bhi he
 On 27 June, 2 BJP councilors Rajneesh Gupta and Ramakrishna Yadav made a proposal to the Lucknow Municipal Corporation, demanding the installation of a statue of Laxman on the municipal land near the mound with mosque
 is prastaav par sahmati ban chuki he lekin prastaav nagar nigam main abhi paas nahin hua he or na hi isapar koi aakhri muhar lagi he
 Controversy before the proposal is passed The statue of Laxman has been disputed even before the proposal is passed
 tile vaali masjid ke imam ne us ilaake main lakshmana kii murti kaa yah kahkar virodh kiya ki yahaan par murti lagane se is ilaake main namaaj adaa karne waalon ko etraj hoga
 Therefore, a statue of Lakshmana should not be installed here
 haalanki, tile vaali masjid ke saamne nagar nigam kii jameen par yah murti lagane kaa prastaav kiya gaya he jiskaa tile vaali masjid se dur-dur tak koi rishta nahin he
 The mound with a mound is also historically called Laxman's mound
 lakhanu ke parshad ramakrishna yadav jinhone lakshmana kii murti ke liye prastaav diya he, unhone ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki aaj bhi yahi ilaaka lakshmana ke tile ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to him, even in the land records, this mound of Laxman is also recorded
 aise main is ilaake main lakshmana kii murti lagaae jane main aitraaj kyon he, jabaki sabhi jaanate hai ki lakhanu lakshmana ke naam par hi basaa tha
 The mayor also supports Lucknow Mayor Samyukta Bhatia openly with the proposal of their councilors
 unhone kaha, 'lakhanu shahar lakshmana ji ke naam se he, meraa yah maananaa he lakshmana ji kii bhavy murti hamaare shahar main honi chahie
 The proposal came to us and everyone accepted it, in which it was decided to make a grand statue of Laxman
 'sanyukta bhaatia ne kaha ki yah koi raajnneetik mudda nahin he
 Despite the protest, he clearly stated that the grand statue will definitely be built
 haalanki, philhal is mudde par agle maheene hone vaali meeting tak faisle ko taala gaya he
 Maulanavas came out in protest, on the other hand, after this proposal in the Municipal Corporation, both Shia and Sunni Maulana are upset with this
 tile vaali masjid ke shahi imam moulana fajaale mannaan ne iskaa sabase pehle virodh kiya or kaha ki masjid ke paas lakshmana kii murti lagane par namaajiyon ko etraj ho saktaa he kyonki murti ke aasapaas namaaj jaij nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, no idol of Laxman should be installed here
 is maamle par tile vaali masjid ke imam ke samarthan main shiya or sunni donon moulana khulkar saamne aa gaye hai
 Sunni Maulana Sufiyan Nizami said the statue could cause tension in the area, so no such proposal could be allowed
 vahiin shiya moulana saf abbaas ne kaha ki agar lakshmana kii murti lagaani he to tile vaali masjid ke aasapaas nahin balki kisi mandir ke bheetar lagaai jaani chahie taaki kisi ko koi aitraaj naa ho
 However, the controversy over Laxman's statue in Lucknow is now catching on
 is mudde par lakhanu nagar nigam jisamen ki bijepi kaa bahumat he or muslim moulana aamane saamne hai
 It remains to be seen if there is any solution to this issue or it becomes another cause of conflict

 slamdog milionair film to aapako yaad hi hogi
 In the film, how a boy living in a slum becomes a millionaire
 haalanki yah film kaalpanik thi
 Its story was taken from a novel
 lekin film se hatakar aisi hi ek sachhee kahani bhi he
 This is the story of Sarath Babu, who grew up in a slum in Chennai
 sarath ne apni kaabiliyat se pehle bits-pilaani or phir im-ahmedabad main admician paaya
 Not only this, he also took the risk of starting his own business by turning down the job of millions
 garib dalit parivaar main janme sarampani kamyaabi kii vajah se kai sammaan or puraskaar paane vaale sarath babu kaa janm chennai ke madipakkam ilaake kii jhuggi main ek dalit parivaar main hua tha
 Sarath's family was very poor
 parivaramen inke do bade bhai or do choti bahanen thim
 The responsibility of running the house was on the mother's shoulders
 unki maa ko ek skool main mid mile banane kii naukari mil gai, jiske liye unhen 30 rupee har maheene milte the lekin paanch bacchon kaa parivaar mahaj 30 rupee main nahin paala ja saktaa tha
 Mother wanted all the children to read a lot so they started selling idli in the morning
 badi mushikalon se padhai puri kii sarath nesarath ne bhi apni maa ko kabhi niraash nahin kiya
 By class 10, he always came first
 kaksha 11 kii admician fees ne unhen uljhan main daal diya
 Sarthen worked out an idea to collect fees
 garmi kii chhuttiyon main unhone duusare bacchon ke saath milakar book-binding kaa kaam shuru kar diya
 The money received from this was enough for his fees
 kaksha 12 ke baad liye saahas bhare faislekaksha 12 ke baad kii padhai ke bare main sarath zyada nahin jaanate the
 a fellow of Sarath told him about Bits Pilani and also said that if he gets admission in it, he will get a good job, which will remove all his poverty
 yah baat sarath ke dimag main baith gai or unhone pariksha kii taiyaari shuru kar di
 Through hard work, Sarath got admission there but the fees there blew his senses
 unke pehle semester kii fees unki shaadishuda bahan ne apane gahane girvee rakh kar die or duusare semester main unhen koi sarkari scolership mil gai
 There was a lesson for him every day in Bits, Pilani
 vahaan se degree lene ke baad unhone cat pariksha kii taiyaari shuru kii
 For the third time, after failing twice, he achieved the necessary rank for admission to IIM
 lakhon kii naukari chhod kiya kaarobaar karne kaa faislaim ahmedabad main padhai ke dauraan hi unhen kai naukariyon ke prastaav aae
 Salary was also in lakhs, but he took a big decision not to do business by doing jobs
 sarath ne 2006 main food king katering services privet limited naam kii ek company kholi
 Earlier this company used to supply tea, coffee, snacks to other companies
 baad main sarath kii company ne bits pilaani or im ahmedabad main bhi apni sarvice prowide kii
 After becoming a successful businessman, Sarath founded the Hunger Free India Foundation in 2010
 is foundation kaa makasad agle baas saalon main bharat ko bhukhmaree mukt bananaa he
 Inspiration from mother takes inspiration from her mother even today
 ve jab bhi pareshaan hote hai yaa kisi samasya se do chaar hote hai to apni maa ko hi yaad karte hai
 Sarath's disappointment is overcome by remembering the story of mother's struggle and sacrifice

 in / Challenger Magnus Carlson defeated defending champion Vishwanathan Anand in the ninth game here on Thursday to reach just half a point from the title at the World Chess Championship
 anand ko aaj safed moharon se khelte hue haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa jisase mukaable kaa nateeja lagbhag tay ho gaya he
 Carlson took a 6-3 lead after nine games and needed just half a point in the remaining three games to become the new world champion
 kaale moharon se khelte hue carlson ne nimjo indian dephence ko chunaa jabaki anand ko pataa tha ki yah unke paas antim mauka he or is bhartiya ne semishch veriation kaa sahaara liya
 Karlsson Baji looked nervous in the beginning, while his position was weakened in the middle of the game, but despite this the Norwegian player kept himself in the match
 baaji ke ant tak bhi carlson kii raji or unt shuruaati khaanon main hi pade the
 Anand had 25 minutes more than Carlson in the 22nd move and was in a better position
 norway ke duniya ke number ek khilaadi carlson ne iske baad apane raja ko anand ke kisi bhi hamale se bachaane vaali sthiti main pahunchaaya
 Anand took about 40 minutes in the 23rd move and decided to continue the attack instead of drawing a draw
 bhartiya diggaj ne iske baad 28veen chaal main badi galati kii jisase carlson kii jeet sunishchit ho gai
 Carlson now needs just one draw for the title and can only win the title in the 10th game tomorrow when he will play white pieces
 carlson ne baaji ke baad kaha, ‘opening ke baad ham romaanchak sthiti main pahunche, lekin pyaade se maine kuch maukey ganvaae
 It was a very strong bet
 ’ Surely this child must have seemed so real that anyone seeing it can understand it
 is vaake par oakland police kaa kahana he ki isse fark nahin padataa ki car main bacchee thi yaa khilonaa, hamaari praathamikta tatkaal ection lenaa he or hamane vahi kiya
 Even after the resignation of Anil Kumble and Ravi Shastri becoming the new coach, the management of the Indian cricket team has not ended in controversy
 bisisiai ke antim elaan ke baavjood abhi khel main kuch or mode aane kii puri sambhaavna bani hui he
 According to sources, former India bowling coach Bharat Arun may be associated with Team India
 bharat arun ko bataur gendbaaji coach judwa sakate hai shastritim india ke head coach ravi shastri bataur gendbaaji coach bharat arun ko team ke saath judwana chaahate hai
 It is also possible to announce soon
 lekin agar aisa hota he to phir jahir khan kaa kad ek baar phir ghat saktaa he or phir wo bataur kansaltent team ke saath videshi dauron par judenge
 Zaheer will not be able to give full time as a coach
 It is known that Zaheer will not be able to give full 250 days time which is necessary for a full time coach
 vah 100 din se adhik samay ke liye bhi uplabdh nahin rahenge
 Not only this, the salary package of Zaheer has not been decided yet and negotiations are going on
 isse pehle shastri se jab bowling coach ke rup main unki pasand poochi gai to unhone arun kaa naam liya lekin siesi kaa ek khaas sadsy iske khilaaf tha
 There are also reports that Zaheer Khan has demanded 4 crores as fee for this post
 jise bisisiai moti rakam maan rahaa he
 After that, he is also considering that Zaheer should also be associated with the Consultant team just like Dravid on major series or occasions
 venketesh prasad ke naam par bhi sahamat nahin shastrishasthri ne iske baad kaha, ‘phir mujhe jaisan gilespie de do
 Gillespie is considered the best bowling coach right now
 shastri samajhate the ki bisisiai gilespie jaise coach ko nahin le saktaa jinase pehle hi papua neugini ne anubandh kar rakhaa he
 The BCCI has also named Venkatesh Prasad as a standby, but it seems that Shastri will not agree on the name of anyone other than Arun
 prasad ko ho saktaa he ki bhartiya team main pasand nahin kiya jaae kyonki apane purv ke kaarykaal ke dauraan unako lekar shikaayat thi ki unhone tej gendbaajon ko line va length vaale madhyam gati ke gendbaajon main badal diya
 Shastri wants Zaheer to be a consultant and Arun in full time role, according to reliable sources from the BCCI
 Shastri can meet the committee of top officials and administrators (COA)
 bisisiai sutron ne gopneeyata kii shart par kaha, ‘ravi jahir kaa puraa sammaan karte hai, lekin unka maananaa he ki phul time gendbaaji coach kaa hona jaruri he
 Zaheer can prepare the roadmap for the bowlers and Arun will implement that
 shastri ke kaarykaal tak team se jude the bharat arunravi shanivaar ko sioe se baat kar sakate hai or yah saaf kar sakate hai ki unhen srilanka daure ke liye bhi team main arun chahie
 If Shastri succeeds in bringing Arun to the team, it will also take revenge on his arch rival Sourav Ganguly who was against keeping him
 arun ko 2014 main jo dowas kii jagah bowling coach banaaya gaya tha or vah 2016 main shastri ko baahar kiye jane tak team ke saath the
 shastri-arun's friendship with the Under-19s may not have been a good career as a player, but he has always been considered one of the best academy coaches and has a good grasp of fast bowling
 arun or shastri donon hi 80 ke dashak ke shuruaati varshon main under-19 ke dinon se dost hai
 It was on Shastri's recommendation that the then president n Srinivasan appointed Arun as the bowling coach of the senior team, when he was the bowling consultant at the National Cricket Academy

 express tribune ne shahabaaz ke hawaale se kaha, “unhone (sharif) bataaya ki jis chikitsak ne purv main unka pareekshan kiya tha, usne kaha tha ki unhen sirf unke swasthya kii jaanch or use pramanit karne ke liye bheja jaataa he
 Doctors said that they had no order to start treatment
 ” neshnal assembly main netaa vipaksh ne kaha ki sharif kii swasthya jaruraton se judi chintaaon ko lekar sarkaar kii vifaltaa khedjanak he
 He said, "it is sad that the treatment of a three-time prime minister is being made a political issue

 Khandu said, 'I have met the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and informed them that we have merged the Congress into the PPA
 rajya main congress ke 46 vidhayak hai jinamein se 43 is party main shaamil ho gaye hai
 PPA was formed in 1979

 In Delhi, after the disqualification of 20 Aam Aadmi Party mlas by the Election Commission, 11 parliamentary secretaries of Chhattisgarh are also in danger of losing their mlas
 aisa hua to rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ke liye badi musiibat khadi ho jaaegi
 The BJP has 49 mlas in a total of 90 seats in the state
 jabaki bahumat ke liye unke paas 46 vidhayak hone chahie
 All the anti-congress parties including the Congress have sent a letter to the Election Commission for early action against the parliamentary secretaries
 haalanki, sansadeey sachivon kii vidhayaki khatm karne ko lekar hai court main bhi maamla vichaaradhin he, lekin taarikh pe taarikh milane ke chalate maamle kii sunwaayee nahin ho paa rahi he

 Now that AAP party mlas have come under the Election Commission radar in Delhi, it is being speculated that the Commission will also give its verdict on BJP mlas in Chhattisgarh
 may 2015 main chhattisgarh main 11 sansadeey sachivon kii niyukti kar mukhyamantri raman singh ne unhen sabhi 13 mantriyon ke saath atech kiya tha

 masalan unhen sarkari bangala, do pie, police suraksha, vaahan suvidha or 11 hajaar rupye masik bhatta ke alaava 73 hajaar rupye vetan sarkari khajaane se diya ja rahaa he
 All these parliamentary secretaries handle the work related to the ministers of their department
 inkaa jalawaa kisi mantri se kam nahin hota
 Along with government burden and wastage to the parliamentary secretaries in the state, a public interest litigation has also been filed in the High Court citing it as a violation of the constitution
 haalanki, is par do teen baar sunwaayee hui or uske baad se lagaataar taarikh pe taarikh milti ja rahi he
 RTI worker Dr

 Also, the office of profit is also violated because the BJP government of the state arbitrarily created an act called the Legislative Assembly Member Dependency Prevention Amendment Act
 isamen inhone 90 padon ko laabh ke padon se alag kar diya, jo ki apane aap main manamaani he
 According to him, he has also challenged that amendment act

 In its initial hearing in August 2017, the Bilaspur High Court had stayed the rights conferred on all 11 parliamentary secretaries
 yahi nahin, unke vetan or bhatton par bhi paabandi lagaai gai
 But using a legal claim, the BJP government in the state blew the High Court directives
 unhen pehle kii tarah sukh suvidhaayen jari raheen
 Now that Parliamentary Secretaries have fallen in Delhi, considering it to be the Tahrir of the Election Commission, all the opposing parties including Congress are united and are demanding immediate action against the Parliamentary Secretaries of the State
 unke mutabik ek samvidhan or do vidhaan nahin ho sakate, masalan 'aap' party ke liye chunaav ayog ke nirdesh kuch or rajya ke bijepi vidhayakon ke liye or kuch
 But the Chief Minister of the state Raman Singh is currently on a stay in Australia, so all parliamentary secretaries have disappeared from their areas after the Election Commission's stand
 chhattisgarh main dilli jaisaa sankat nahin: brijmohan agarwalaummid kii ja rahi he ki raman singh ke chhattisgarh aane ke baad ye sansadeey sachiv raipur kii raah pakad len
 Currently, Law Minister Brijmohan Aggarwal Morcha in-charge of the state is meeting
 unhone kaha ki rajya main dilli jaisaa sankat nahin he, kyonki unki sarkaar ne vaidhanik rup se karrwai karte hue sansadeey sachiv ke pad ko offis of profit ke daayre se baahar rakhaa he
 The Congress has filed 22 applications and complaints against the Parliamentary Secretaries in the last two years with Governor Beedi Tandon regarding this matter
 isamen 11 aavedan sansadeey sachivon ko unke padon se hataane ke hai, jabaki shesh 11 unhen ayogy ghoshit karne ke
 However, the Congress alleges that the Governor did not send any applications and complaints to the Election Commission nor did he himself hear it

 The PDP-BJP government of the state and the Central Election Commission have come face to face with the by-elections to be held in the Anantnag Lok Sabha seat in Jammu and Kashmir
 chunaav ayog abhi tak 25 may ko hi anantnag main upachunaav karwaane par ada hua he, or duusari taraf rajya sarkaar november se pehle chunaav karwaane ke paksh main nahin he, kyonki rajya sarkaar ke mutabik abhi vahaan halaat chunaav ke anukool nahin hai
 Apart from these, now the Election Commission wants to conduct voting in Anantnag in separate stages, not at once
 pehle bhi aisi khabaren ai thim ki centre sarkaar bhi kashmir ke donon sansadeey ilaakon main upachunaav karwaane kii icchhuk nahin thi, lekin chunaav ayog ne uski bhi andekhi kii thi
 The Center had written a letter to the Commission for this and said that the election should be postponed for the time being as the situation in the valley is not good
 vaise, chunaav ayog kii team dakshin kashmir ke halaat kaa gauge le chuki he
 Although everyone is worried about the violence during the Budgam and Srinagar by-elections, and in view of such security situation, the Commission is seeking to hold the Anantnag seat in two-three phases, but the state government is also against it
 rajya sarkaar ke mutabik, vajah badgaam or srinagar main hue upachunaav ke dauraan hui hinsa he, jisamen aath logon kii maut ho gai thi or saikadon log ghayal hue the
 The ruling PDP even goes so far as to say that the people of the princely state are not in the mood for elections, so the by-election should be postponed
 gauratlab he ki hinsa ke alaava 9 april ko badgaam or srinagar main hue upachunaav main kul saat fisadi matdaan hi hua tha
 The by-election in Anantnag seat was also to be held on 12 April, but it was postponed to 25 May due to the violence on 9 April
 tippaniyan It is reported that in view of the poor security arrangements, the state government had demanded 300 additional companies of security forces, but the commission provided half of the security force to them

 For this reason, the Election Commission has now decided to conduct polling in phases at its level, so that security arrangements can be strengthened
 ayog kaa maananaa he ki 25 may tak kshetra main kanoon or vyavastha kii haalat main sudhaar aa jayega, jisase vahaan swatantra or nishpaksh chunaav karaae ja sakenge

 haalanki badgaam or srinagar upachunaav ke dauraan hui hinsa se har koi chitint he, or aise suraksha halaat ko dekhte hue hi ayog anantnag seat par do-teen charnon main chunaav karwaanaa chaah rahaa he, lekin rajya sarkaar uske bhi viruddh he
 According to the state government, the reason is violence during the by-elections in Budgam and Srinagar, in which eight people were killed and hundreds were injured
 sattashin pidipi kaa to yahaan tak kahana he ki philhal riyasat ke log chunaav ke mood main nahin hai, lihaaza upachunaav ko taal dena chahie
 It is worth noting that apart from the violence, in the by-elections held in Budgam and Srinagar on April 9, there was a total turnout of seven percent
 anantnag seat par upachunaav bhi 12 april ko hi hona tha, lekin 9 april ko hui hinsa kii vajah se hi use 25 may tak taala gaya tha

 Another major reason for worsening situation in Srinagar was that about 65 of these companies of security forces could not be deployed, as they had reached after noon on the polling day
 isi vajah se chunaav ayog ne apane str par ab matdaan ko charnon main karwaane kaa faisla liya he, taaki suraksha ke intazaam pukhta ho saken
 The Commission believes that the law and order situation will improve in the region by May 25, so that free and fair elections can be held there
