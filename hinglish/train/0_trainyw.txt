 But being an engineer, cultivating strawberries is opening new doors of growth for farmers
 deepak jivan main kuch alag karnaa chaahate hai isliye unhone ejineering ko chhodkar kheti karne kaa man banaaya
 He started cultivating strawberries on his ancestral land

 For this, his friend explained some remedies and started farming by watching videos on youtube

 For which he decided to do farming in the winter

 He told that the distance between two queues should initially be 10 to 12 inches
 aise karte hai strawberry kii marketingdipak ke gaanv se jude bilawar or ajmer main unki strawberry kii acchhee maang he
 This is because it is not being cultivated in the surrounding areas

 He sells his crop directly to customers
 jhopadi main rahati hai ye 'daadi maa', jaane- kyon PM modi ne kii tarifestrawberry ko zyada samay tak store karke nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 At the same time, strawberries grown in Maharashtra are first brought to Ahmedabad and then transported to nearby markets
 is puri prakriya main ek hafte tak kaa samay lagata he or is vajah se graahakon ko taaji strawberry nahin mil paati
 With this, Deepak is happy that he is providing fresh strawberries to the customers

 a screw in the case is that a few days later, a Jat girl found in Delhi with a Dalit boy described it as a case of cheating, not of love
 bagpat jile ke espi se jat ladki ne shikaayat kii he ki dalit ladkaa use bahala-phusalaakar dilli le gaya tha, jahaan usne uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 The SP has said to take action after investigating the case

 The girl says that for the sake of the family's respect, she did not reveal this reason to anyone first

 aage kii kahani ke bare main jaanane ke liye aapako cinemaghar tak janaa padegaa
 The drawback of this film is its script, which deviates from the issue as well as its screenplay which prolongs the film
 choti si kahani ko moments creat karne ke liye film ko 2 ghante main failaai gai he
 De-focusing makes the film a bit boring
 iske alaava isi mudde par ham 'toilet- ek prem katha' or 'halkaa' jaisi filmein dekh chuke hai to vishay kii novalti bhi utani nahin rahati
 Another major drawback of the film is that you do not feel the heart of the story in many places as well as many characters
 baavjood iske ki ham is vishay par sau filmein dekh chuke hai, phir bhi is film kii sabase badi khubi he iskaa vishay, kyonki bataur filmkaar apni jimmedaari samajhate hue rakesh om prakaash mehara ne yah vishay uthaaya
 Apart from this, another feature is the performances of Anjali Patil and Om Kannaujia
 iske alaava film ke gane achche lage phir chaahe wo inkaa sangeet ho yaa phir likhaayi
 At the same time, i would like to compliment the film's cinematography, which keeps the film close to its world

 Kapil Mishra, a former minister in the Delhi government, accused Kejriwal of spreading religious hysteria and said that Arvind Kejriwal was doing this to divert attention from his works
 kapil mishra ne kaha ki dilli ke aspataalon main bed nahin he, dilli ke gharon main pani nahin aa rahaa he, vidhayak janata se milte nahin hai
 In such a situation, Arvind Kejriwal is hiding the lack of his legislators by doing hindu-muslim
 kapil mishra ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne 26 janvari ko bacchon ke saamne jaharila bhaashan diya or ab tipu sultan kii tasviir laga di
 Please do not react to Tipu Sultan's photo in Delhi Assembly
 ghungroo seth dilli kaa maahaul kharaab karnaa chahta hai

 Inflammatory speeches and deeds are being done

 On the other hand, Delhi BJP spokesperson Tejinder Bagga said that Arvind Kejriwal should get a picture of martyr Abdul Hameed as he blew up Pakistani tanks
 jabaki arvind kejariwal mughal aakrantha tipu sultan ko tarjeeh de rahe hai
 Bagga said that Kejriwal brother Matidas is forgetting Bandabahadur and is giving preference to Tipu Sultan who forcibly converted millions of Hindus
 bagga ne elaan kiya ki yadi dilli vidhansabha se kejariwal ye tasviir nahin utaravaate hai to janabhaavana kaa khyaal rakhte hue wo swayan is tasviir ko utaar denge
 Let us know that the Government of Kerala, Kejriwal has put a picture of Tipu Sultan on 26 January in Delhi Assembly
 jaahir he dilli vidhansabha main tipu sultan kii tasviir lagaae jane par ab siyaasi bavaal shuru ho gaya he
 Opposition parties have now started targeting the Aam Aadmi Party on this issue

 OP Sharma said, 'when Kejriwal knows that this is disputed, why the picture was put

 ' Before leaving Delhi, Modi said that he is going to the high peaks of snow with the message that all the people standing behind the troops guarding the border are standing firm
 diwali ke tyohaar par jammu kashmir ke baadh prabhavit logon ke saath kuch kshan bitaane ke liye srinagar jane se pehle modi ne siachin kaa daura kiya
 He said, 'I am going to Siachen on behalf of every Indian with the message that we are standing shoulder to shoulder with you

 jis tarah kii bhashaa yogi bol rahe hai, us par kadi karrwai honi chahie or mukadmaa darj hona chahie
 Ashok Gehlot said in the conversation till date that undercurrent is going on in the country against Modi in the elections
 jisaki vajah se jaanboojhkar sena or hindu or raashtra bhakthi jaise maamle chunaav main laae ja rahe hai
 And such an atmosphere is being created as if we are not nationalists
 indira gandhi ne pakistan ke do tukade kar die the, tab vah chunaav haarin to badi namrata ke saath morarji desai ko satta saunpi thi
 There is no role of army in the election of democracy but a dangerous game is being played in the name of army

 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke bangale kii lite kaatane ke aarope par gahalot ne kaha ki jisaki bhaavana jaisi rahati he vaise hi sochataa he
 If power is cut in civil lines, then mine will also be cut
 main to unke ghar ke saamne hi rahata hum, or iske saath hi saalon se negative raajnneeti karne kaa tanj bhi ksaa or kaha ki ab bhi vah vahi kar rahi hai
 Due to this, he was defeated

 Some people are being deliberately made modi-modi

 Love is a very beautiful feeling
 jab do log pyaar main hote hai to unhen apana jivan bhi khubasurat lagane lagata he
 Also, when people who are in love touch each other for the first time, that feeling is very different, which cannot be described in words
 aaie jaane, jab do pyaar karne vaale log pehali baar ek duusare kaa haath pakadte hai to unhen kaisaa mahasoos hota he
 1
 jab do pyaar karne vaale ek duusare ke haath ko jakadakar pakadte hai to isse ye saaf hota he ki aapkaa partner aapako lekar kaaphi syrius he
 Your partner has a special place in your heart
 jise koi bhi mitaa nahin saktaa he
 Due to these reasons, the trend of single living is increasing in women
 agar aapkaa partner aapkaa haath cross kar ke pakadta he to iskaa yah matlab he ki wo aapako lekar bahut kering he
 He can also put his happiness at stake to make you happy
 3
 When a couple holds each other's hand tightly even in the crowd, it shows that they want to hold their partner's hand throughout their life and they are not hesitant to express their love in public too
 
 jhagadate samay partner se kahin aap to nahin bolte ye baaten?4
 If a friend of yours tries to hold your hand with some excuse, then understand that the feeling of friendship has started taking the form of love in the heart of that person and he has started to understand you more than a friend
 5
 When someone holds your hand only with the help of fingers, it means that the person is very casual about you

 For good health, the body needs all kinds of nutrients from proteins, vitamins, cabrehydrates, but the question arises from where to get all this
 jawaab he- paneer
 That is, cheese, which contains protein, vitamins, carbohydrates, fat, everything and that too
 aahaar visheshgy shila saharaavat kahati hai ‘sehat kii baat aane par paushtik aahaar ke rup main doodh or isse bane vyanjanon kaa naam sabase pehle aata he
 Among milk products, traditional Indian products like Malai, Rabri, Curd, Khoya, Butter, as well as 'cheese' which have come to India from abroad are also increasing in popularity
 isamen protein, vitamin, carbohydrate, vasa, calcium, phosphorus aadi kii bharpoor maatra hoti he
 "cheese Day" is celebrated in some western countries on January 20 due to this nutritious quality of cheese

 Sahrawat says that in terms of health, cheese is more beneficial than butter
 motaape kii beemaari se grasit log bhi santulit maatra main cheez kaa seven kar sakate hai, jabaki unhen anya vasayukta khaadya padaarthon se puri tarah parhez karne kii salaah di jaati he
 Another dietitian, Gopa Mohanty, says that cheese is made from milk protein and fat
 bachche agar doodh pine main anakani karte hai to unhen paneer yukt bhojan bhi diya ja saktaa he, jiske madhyam se unke sharir main protein kii paryaapt maatra pahunchaai ja sakati he
 Paneer is also a good diet for pregnant women
 cheez yaa paneer kuch samay pehle tak bharat main sirf ucch varg ke bhojan kaa hissaa hua karti thi, lekin kuch samay se isane madhyam varg ke vyanjanon main bhi apni paith bana lee he
 Experts attribute this to the cheese's favorable properties and delicious taste
 dilli main kukri class chalaane vaali pratimaa farukhi bataati hai ‘‘adhiktar europea vyanjanon main paneer kaa ek khaas sthaan hota he
 People aware of the nutritional properties of cheese do not avoid its consumption as much as butter and other oily substances do
 paneer ke seven ke dauraan unhen yah tasalli rahati he ki unke bhojan main vasa kii maatra bahut zyada nahin he
 "farooqui says that by mixing cheese in many dishes, he gave them a modern look and this experiment was well liked by the people
 ab log unke inhen prayogon ko rosemara ke bhojan main upyog karke uske swaad ko ‘chiz’ se behad lajiz bana rahe hai
 Farooqui said that he has started experimenting with its use in traditional Indian food like dosa and casserole
 mul rup se pashchimi deshon ke bhojan main shaamil paneer ke mul utpaadak sthaan ke bare main koi thos pramaan uplabdh nahin hai
 It is believed that the taste of cheese was first introduced to the countries of Europe, Central Asia or Middle East, after which it spread to every corner of the world
 bharat main paneer kaa upyog videshi vyanjanon main, khaas kar pizza, toast, pasta or sandwich main hota he
 In India, cheese vegetable is eaten in every household with fervor

 In Noida in broad daylight, the software engineer Ankit Chauhan was killed
 vaardaat us vakt kii he jab ejeeniyar apane dost gagan ke saath apni forchunar car main ja rahaa tha
 He suspects that someone is following him in another car (honda Accord car)
 yah khel kareeb 15 kilometre tak chalata rahaa
 Suddenly the car overtakes the nephortooner
 ankit ne apane kajan ko phone par bataaya, 'bhai koi meraa peechha kar rahaa he
 He will kill me mujhe bachaa lo bhai'
 While talking, suddenly the sound of bullet was heard on the phone

 Surprisingly, the friend of the engineer riding in the same car spared the murderer
 jo teen goli maari wo teenon sirf or sirfaijiniyar ko nishanepar lekar behad kareeb se maari
 His friend did not even scratch
 apane dost ko is tarah goli lagate hue dekhakar gagan ke haath-paanv phool gayi
 He could not understand what to do
 gagan ko gaadi chalaani bhi nahin aati thi
 Shortly with the help of people gathered on the spot, he removed Ankit from the driving seat and took him to the nearby Shivalik Hospital but after being told his serious condition there, people took Ankit to Kailash Hospital
 vahaan doctor ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 It is being told that Ankit got married on March 10 this year
 noida jaise shahar main kaatil ne din-dahaade 15 kilometre tak filmi style main car se peechha karke goli markar hatya karke dil dahala diya he
 Later it was found that the number of the Accord car that had a killer in it was fake
 isse andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kaatil pehle se soch-samaj kar puri planning ke saath aae the
 But the cause of the murder has not been ascertained
 police ke mutabik maane to tata kansaltency services yani tisies main kaam karne vaale ankit kii somvaar ko chuttee thi

 aakhir ankit kaa kaatil koun ho saktaa he or kya vajah ho sakati he is katl kii? sutron kii maane to noida police philhal teen vajahon ko saamne rakhkar maamle kii tafteesh kar rahi he
 The first reason was anger, the second reason was Ankit's wedding a month ago
 jabaki teesri vajah ankit miss aaidentification yani galat pahchaan kaa shikaar ban gaya ho
 The police investigating this case is focused on the old enemy of someone who dies
 kya ankit ke katl kaa taar meerut, mujffarnagar yaa phir bangaleru se judaa he? darasal ankit meerut kaa rahane vaala tha

 Of course, this year, the united opposition in three constituencies of Uttar Pradesh has dented the BJP, but the BJP has found a hole in this scheme of opposition
 party kaa maananaa he ki bhaajapa ke khilaaf vipakshi dalon ke eka kaa suchakank keval uttar pradesh main upar he, jahaan se loksabhaa ke 80 saansad chune jate hai
 a party leader says, "UP is definitely a concern for us
 ''ek anya netaa ke shabdon main, "duusare rajyon main to vipakshi ekta narendra modi ke paksh main bhaavnaatmak maahaul banane kaa kaam karegi or iskaa asar yah hoga ki janata un logon ke khilaaf ekajute ho jaaegi jo ek eemaandaar pradhanmantri ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye lamaband honge
 "similarly, a leader says," If the CPI (M) joins the TMC in West Bengal or the Congress aligns with the BJD in Odisha or the KCR in Telangana, then it will create difficulties for us
 lekin aisa kuch nahin hoga
 To tackle the challenge of SP-BSP in UP, we have set a target of getting 50 percent votes and in this we are behind by just six percent
 thode prayaas se ise paanaa koi mushkil kaam nahin
 "to assess its position in the entire UP, the BJP does not consider Kairana with 33 per cent Muslim votes as compared to 73 per cent voting in 2014, this time only 61 per cent
" party yah bhi maanati he ki rashtriya str par najaara kuch or hoga jahaan muqabla modi banaam rahul yaa phir modi banaam anya hoga
 As Amit Shah puts it, "opposition unity is a phenomenon that the media is exaggerating

 The BJP is not even thinking of a change in the leadership of these states when it has changed the party president in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where modi-shah Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has been dragging the equation, to bring in the new party president
 Preparations are underway
 ab tak is par sahmati nahin ban pai he ki raaje ke kareebi ashok paranami kii jagah nayaa party adhyaksh kise niyukt kiya jaae
 It is said that under pressure from Modi and Shah, Parnami stepped down in April
 bhaajapa ko lagata he ki is samay agar rajya yaa phir rashtriya str par bada pherbadal kiya gaya to usase party kaa pradarshan behatar to nahin hoga, kharaab jarur ho saktaa he
 That is why Shah is working with Rajnath's old team at the national level, he has just added some faces to it
 party main kai logon kaa maananaa he ki amit shah ko puure tareeke se apni team khadi kerani chahie thi or unka yathasthitivaadee rukh khataron bharaa sabit ho saktaa he
 Sources close to Amit Shah say they do not have a choice
 party ke ubharate netaaon samet 2014 se pehle kii puri rashtriya team ko modi cabinet main shaamil kar liya gaya he
 Shah is, however, quite hopeful of the party's prospects in states and general elections
 unke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki na keval madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh balki rajasthan main bhi party satta bachaane ke lihaaj se kaaphi acchhee sthiti main he
 The changing leadership leadership has started taking care of the states where elections are going to be held this year or which are important from the point of view of 2019 general election

 Modi and Shah recently spent the entire day in Delhi with more than 1,000 office bearers of party fronts affiliated with youth, women, Dalits, tribes, farmers, other backward classes and minorities to give the plan an edge
 yah pehali baar tha jab in saaton sanghathanon ke logon kii ek saath baithak ho rahi thi
 Shah told the workers, "out of our 11 crore activists, AAP is the center of the party and you are the future of the party
 aap hi ve log hai jo aane vaale samay main party kaa netritv karenge
 Now is the time to prove your abilities by bringing people closer to the party based on our actions
 '' unhone pashchim bengal or kerala main bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon par ho rahe hamalon kaa ullekh karte hue kaaryakartaaon kaa aahvaan kiya ki ve iskaa jawaab bailat se den
 Apart from Shah and Modi, party general secretaries also addressed the two sessions and during this time every front discussed the ground issues
 jan-dhan yojana, mudra yojana, ujjwala gas kit yojana ho yaa phir swasthya beemaa or sabko ghar uplabdh karaane kii yojana, kaaryakartaaon ko sarkaar kii pramukh yojanaon ke bare main jaankaree di gai
 The government estimates that 22 crore people have benefited from these schemes and party workers will be asked to reach these people in a planned manner
 bhaajapa kaaryakarta yah abhiyaan july main shuru karke chah maah tak ise chalaayenge
 According to the plan, the workers will go to the beneficiaries of these schemes with flowers, party insignia and dupatta bearing the picture of Prime Minister Modi and ask them how this scheme made their life easier
 dilli ke party mukhyalay sthit hytech niyantran kaksh main baithkar party adhyaksh amit shah khud is vishaal jansampark kaarykram par najar rakhenge
 All this is in line with the notion that they are very cautious in monitoring the government's big plans
 shah ne 22 karod labhaarthiyon se judaa digital data hasil kar liya he or use unhone party ke data bank main daal diya he
 Before going to any beneficiary, the party worker has to give a missed call to the toll free number associated with the BJP control room
 isse do phaayde honge
 First, the beneficiary's name will be updated in the party's data bank and second, it will be ensured that no worker at the grassroots level goes wrong
 bhaajapa rashtriya yuva morche ke sachiv saurav sikadar kehete hai, "yah ek sochi-samajhi or phulpruf yojana kaa hissaa he

 Along with this, the administrative capacity of Yogi is also under question
 isaki misaal he ki vaada karke bhi yogi ganna bazaar main adhik uplabdhta kii samasya khatm nahin kar sake
 In the case of the Central Crop Insurance Scheme, the performance of all the states including UP has not been as good and it is considered to be a big reason for a section of people in the rural areas to separate from the party

 Their ruination caused considerable damage to the farmers
 bhaajapa kii ek badi samasya modi-shah kii karypranali bhi he jo anushaasan ke naam par vichaar-vimarsh kii gunjaaish nahin chhodti or isse party netritv kaa ek varg naaraaz rahata he
 However, those unhappy with this also know that everything in the party is done by the will of modi-shah and the image of Modi among the public is of a person who fights against corruption and this is the biggest attraction for the party in 2019

 Broad said he wanted people to fear England the same way people feared Australia in the 90s

 pehali baar har 50 voter par ek vyakti niyukt kiya gaya tha jise apane-apane hisse ke voter ko nikaal kar booth tak le jane kii jimmedaari thi
 The Prime Minister himself may not have come here to campaign, but almost all the ministers of the state, from the Chief Minister and Minister of the Cabinet, are not only camping here, but held street meetings and meetings of 10 to 20 people
 chunaav ayog ne bhi matdaan ke pratishat ko badhaane ke liye har sambhav koshish kii
 Apart from the programs of ngos, to increase polling percentage, model polling booths, pink booths, selfie points, sports facilities were also organized at the polling booths for children, despite this, the indifference of the people was shown and the voters first Class failed to pass
 yahaan tak ki 2014 ke matdaan ke pratishat se bhi 1
 The turnout was 38 percent
 2014 main 58
 The turnout was 35 percent while 56 this time
 97 fisadi matdaan hua
 There are 18,04,636 voters in Banaras out of which 10,28,061 exercised their franchise i
e
 7 lakh 76 thousand 574 voters did not come out of the houses due to indifference in the items or due to weather indifference
 vidhansabha waar dekhen to varanasi loksabhaa main paanch vidhansabha main chaar par bijepi kaa to ek par sahyogi dal apana dal kaa kabza he
 But the city of bjp's mood has a lower turnout in the urban constituency as compared to last time
 isamen cant vidhansabha main sabase kam 52
 The turnout was 42 percent
 duusare number par shahar uttari vidhansabha kshetra jahaan 54
 71 percent of the vote was held
 shahar dakshini main bhi 58
 16 per cent of the votes were cast while these are the assembly where the BJP has the maximum votes
 is kam matdaan ke peeche ke kaaran kya hai or kyon piem kii kaashi ne unhen niraash kiya
 On this, Prime Minister Modi himself will churn, but it is being reviewed within the BJP as well as every street intersection of Benares
 log alag-alag tarah se dekh rahe hai
 The first thing is coming out that when the Prime Minister came here to contest elections in 2014, his political life in Benaras was zero
 saath hi unhone apane majboot vyaktitv ke saath logon ko ye bharosa bhi dilaayaa ki wo sirf vaada hi nahin karte balki apane vaade ko sach kaa libaas pehanaane kii taaqat bhi rakhte hai
 The public broke down and trusted him
 lekin 2019 main unka rajanithik jivan banaras main paanch saal kaa ho gaya is paanch saal main unhone kai kaam kiye takreeban 40 hazaar karod kii yojana laaye lekin kya ye yojana jameen par ai yaa bahut si yojanaayen sirf kaagazon par rah gayi
 In Banaras, faced with the basic problems like road, electricity, water jam, only the outer Banaras looked changed but the inner Banaras is still in the same situation today
 hryday or amrit yojana sirf kuch sadakon or galiyon tak simat kar rah gai
 Apart from this, the Vishwanath Corridor scheme, which Modi put on his heels to bring to the ground, also annoyed some voters of the core BJP and appeared indifferent in the election
 machuaaraa samaaj bhi in paanch saalon main modi kii yojana ganga main cruge or jetti ko lekar apni rozi roti ke liye sangharsh hi karata nazar aayaa
 The business class too was not very happy with the demonetisation and GST, the effect of which is reflected in the apathy of the voting percentage
 in sab ke alaava ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki piem modi ke khilaaf koi damdaar pratyaashee nahin khadaa tha lihaaja unke khilaaf ke vot main koi utsaah nahin dikhaa
 a strong MLA from his party, opposing Mahagathbandhan candidate Shalini Yadav, started campaigning for NOTA
 daliton main bhi is baar niraashaa hi dikhi
 Initially, there was an atmosphere in the Congress that Priyanka would contest from here, but when she did not come, that enthusiasm also turned cold
 is baar ramajaan kii vajah se or manmutabik pratyaashee na hone kii vajah se muslim matadaata bhi puure josh ke saath matdaan karne nahin niklaa, isamen muslim mahilaon kaa pratishat or bhi kam rahaa
 These are the reasons why the Prime Minister was disappointed in the hope of getting votes by a record number of votes, but this time it may be that despite winning less votes, he will win the election with more votes than the previous vote
 baavjood iske unhen niraashaa hi hanth lagegi ki khilaaf main koi majboot pratyaashee nahin tha phir bhi record mat nahin mila

 12000 farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra

 -input IANS In Mumbai, a three-month-old baby beat the death such that people are calling him 'miracle Baby'
 apni paidaaish ke saath hi dil main chhed lekar paidaa hue aradhy kii saansen ek oparation ke dauraan 45 minute tak rukii raheen
 Despite this, due to the courage of doctors of a hospital in Mumbai, he is now living a new life
 oparation se hi batch sakati thi jaanatiin maheene kaa aradhy ab aam bacchon kii tarah rah rahaa he, lekin aradhy aam bacchon kii tarah is duniya main nahin aayaa tha
 Born in a poor family, it was learned that Adhara was born with a hole in her heart
 aradhy kii jaan ek safal oparation se hi batch sakati thi
 In such a situation, his parents brought him to Mumbai and doctors of Bai Jerbai Wadia Children's Hospital gave Aradhya a new life after an operation of 26 hours
 blue baby syndrome se grasit tha aradhyaye sab kuchdoctoronke liye bhi itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 The fact that Aaradhya had a hole in her heart was known before she was born
 iske baavjood uske mata-pita ne use janm dene kaa faisla kiya tha
 Adorable was suffering from blue baby syndrome
 ye syndrome 6 maah se kam umr ke bacchon main paae jate hai, jisamen unka dil garbhavastha main thik se viksit nahin ho paata
 As a result, their hearts are not able to supply blood to the body according to their needs, nor oxygen
 aise bacchon kii twachaa, khaskar hont ke agal-bagal ke hisse or ungaliyon kaa rang oxigen kii kami kii vajah se nila ho jaataa he
 When the doctors at Aradhya's breath stopped for 45 minutes, the doctors of the hospital took a decision to save the operation, but their hopes were also broken when Aaradhya's breath stopped for 45 minutes
 haalanki doctoron ke prayaas se aradhy ko aaj ek nai jindagi mili he
 Adorable can now lead a normal life just like ordinary children
 wo aise halaat se jivit baahar niklaa he, jahaan se kam hi bachche waapas aa pate hai
 That's why people are calling Aaradhya as 'miracle Baby'

 kabir 'phantum' main lekar aae hai, saf ali khan, katrina caff, sabyasachi chakravarti, mohammad jishaan ko
 The story of 'phantom' is based on Hussain Zaidi's book 'mumbai Avengers', which seeks to find the terrorist involved in the 26 / 11 attack and end it under a secret mission

 You must have seen something similar in 'D Day' and 'baby', this is the biggest flaw of the film
 in vishyon ko pehle dekhne ke kaaran ye taaja nahin lagate
 The hero of the film, Daniyal, that Saif eliminates the enemies of India, does not digest
 kaaphi seens filmkaar kii sahuliyaton par nirbhar najar aate hai

 ) amritsar se bijepi ke saansad navjot singh siddhu laapata hai or unke naam kaa gumshudagi kaa ishtihaar bhi chap gaya he
 This is a joke, but the reason for this is that they are missing from their area Amritsar
 congress ko mauka mil gaya or usne netaji ko dhundne kii munaadi bas khuleam kar di
 Opponents were waiting for the opportunity, according to the advertisement, Navjot Singh Sidhu has no idea for 3 months
 amritsar kii deevaaron par gumshudagi ke poster laga kar siddhu kii talash kii ja rahi he
 In fact, after being elected MP, these fiery leaders of BJP have disappeared completely
 virodhiyon ko jaise isi maukey kaa intjaar tha
 Sidhu's missing advertisement has been prepared and a report has been written in the police
 khojane vaale ko milegaa inam!congress ne police main rapat likhaai he ki hamaare shahar ke empi gum hai, jo bhi dhundhakar laaegaa use inam diya jayega
 It is being said that Navjot Singh Sidhu is on a leash with local leaders on the issue of development, so he is away from Amritsar

 In Madhya Pradesh, the Chief Minister and his political soldiers are going all over the state and telling them how the students will have to pay the price of business
 How the state of the state is getting gritty with this infamy
 puri party ise rajya ke sammaan se jodne par utaaru he
 The question is arising that whose honor is the BJP talking about? Respect for leaders and self-respect? Or to honor the rotten throat system, which was allowed by the Chief Minister of the state to flourish and be settled? ham kaise bhul jaaen ki jo aaropee andar hai or har din vyaapman ghotaale ke chakkar main andar ja rahe hai wo kal tak mukhyamantri ke saath photo khinchvaate the? har din akhabaaron main aate the
 The Chief Minister himself felt that all these were his own
 gulab singh kiraar ko ham kaise bhul jaaen jo apane bete ke sang vyapmcand main aaropee hai
 Was the surveyor of the Backward Commission of Madhya Pradesh
 mukhyamantri shivaraj chouhan ke sang wo kiraar sammelan main aate the
 Now tell me how no one can believe that the honor of the Chief Minister was associated with Gulab Singh Kirar, so he was left? jis sudhir sharma ko party ke adane se lekar aalaa tak gale lagaate the, usko rajya kaa puraa system ab bhi apana maanata he
 Sudhir Sharma's respect may not be lost, so perhaps the BJP of the state has not removed him from the party yet
 to phir kis sammaan or kis swabhimaan kii baat karte hai, rajya ke mukhyamantri ? The police of the state kept calling Namrata Damore's death a normal death, what changed so that the CBI came overnight and registered this case in 302? Why did the authorities no longer care about the honor of the state? Comments aap koi bhi press conference uthaakar dekh lijie samaj aa jayega ki kaise mukhyamantri shivaraj khud ke vajood se aage badhate nahin dikhe vyaapman cese ke dauraan
 Earlier, the Congress has been doing this as well
 
 
 to wo ham par sawaal uthaane vaale koun hai? phir kehete rahe ki wo insaaf dilaanaa chaahate the isaliye cese darj karaae
 
 
 Then he became a whistle blower
 
 Then he started connecting his gritty with the honor of the state
 hamen rajya ke mukhyamantri kyon nahin bataa rahe ki jin chaatro ne lagan se padhai kii, jinke parache achche gayi or aas thi ki naukari jaruri milegi unke sammaan ko waapas koun laaegaa ? koun batayega ghar ghar jaakar ki betaa, beti to hoshiyaar the, lekin system chaalaak tha, jisane unki pratibha or sammaan kii hatya kar di
 Next time when it comes to respect and self-respect, just think about whom the Chief Minister is talking about on his visits

 Why are the Chief Ministers of the State not telling us that who will bring back the respect of the students who studied diligently, whose tests went well and were hoping that a job would be necessary? Who would tell that son and daughter were smart, but the system was clever, which killed their talent and honor
 agali baar jab sammaan or swabhimaan kii baat ho to zaraa sochiyegaa ki yatraaon ke shaukeen mukhyamantri kiski baat kar rahe hai

 23 varshon ke baad jab do pratidwandvi gale mili to badi ghatana honi chahie thi or majamaa ikattha hona chahie tha, lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 After getting the notes of two big but battered leaders, the public did not take care of them
 jedy(you) supremeo nitish kumaar or argedy ke bos lalu yadav kaa aapas main milanaa media event ke alaava koi sandesh nahin de paaya
 His much hyped show was a flop
 darasal jo log deevaaron par likhi ibaarat nahin pard pate hai, unke saath aisa hi hota he
 Nitish Babu was regarded as a good governance man who called for the abolition of Bihar's misrule on the injury of Danke and also succeeded
 raajnneeti main yah unki sabase badi puunji thi jise unhone hajipur ke subhai jamalpur gaanv main ganvaa diya
 Given that his party is in power, the arrival of a few 'hundred' people in this show must have been a terrible nightmare for him
 unhen ummid rahi hogi ki is sabha main khub bheed hogi or log unke purv sakha lalu yadav ke saath dekhne ko umad padenge
 But this dream remained
 bhartiya raajnneeti ke kshatrapon kii yah khaas baat rahi he ki ve apni ichchhaaon or aakankshaon ke aadhaar par hi raajnneeti karte hai
 No one else's opinion or democratic views matter to them
 unke paas samarthakon kii ek fouj hoti he jis par ve raaj karte hai or apni ichchhaaon kaa laadate rahete hai
 Obviously, Nitish Kumar is no exception
 ve yah maanakar chalate hai ki ve jo bhi karenge unke samarthakon ko maanya hoga lekin is baar vah maat kha gaye
 JD (U) activists worked hard to defeat Lalu Prasad's party, did one day and night and most importantly, they earned the credibility of their party in their respective areas
 lekin ab nitish kumaar chaahate hai ki ve apane kiye-karaae par pani pher den kyonki unhen narendra modi pasand nahin hai
 This extreme dislike is taking the party to the abyss
 unke kaaryakarta unke is tughluqi farmaan ko maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai or iskaa udhaaharan somvaar ko unhen mil gaya
 Though he spewed venom against the BJP as usual in the synagogue, he did not get the response he expected
 unki or unke nae mitra kii, jo unhen chota bhai bataa rahe hai, baton se laga ki is tathakthith mahagathbandhan kaa makasad sirf or sirf bijepi ko dhul chataana he
 Nitish Kumar got the throne of Bihar because he had raised a ray of hope among crores of Biharis living in hellish life and later also gave them a better life
 lekin ab vah unheen takaton se samjhauta kar rahe hai ki jo us rajya kii durdasha ke liye jimmedaar hai
 Nobody is able to embrace this thing
 lalu yadav khush hai
 He again sees the throne of Bihar
 unke raste kaa kanta dur ho chukaa he or unhe lag rahaa he ki aanevaale dinon main phir se vah apni dhak jamaa sakenge
 But after Monday's rally and power show, he must have realized his condition
 nitish babu ke liye to yah bada jhatka rahaa hoga
 However, now wait for the results of the by-election and then guess who is in how much water

 Realme ne bharat main apane nae Realme x mid range smartphone ke saath bajet smartphone Realme 3i ko bhi launch kar diya he
 We are going to tell you here how the Realme 3i is at first sight
 sabase pehle isaki khaas baton kaa zikr karen to isamen 6
 a large 22-inch battery is provided and the Notch display is given in the front

 isaki pehali cell 23 july ko dopaher 12 baje se hogi
 Talking about the build quality and design of Realme 3i, let me tell you that by taking it in hand, it is known that this smartphone is quite light and slick
 haalanki disple ke maamle main ye smartphone Galaxy M10 is segment main thodaa peeche he, yani yahaan samsung vaala magic nahin he, lekin disple ko aap itnaa bura bhi nahin kar sakate
 There is a notch display
 aise main ye kaaphi behatar he
 However, in the budget segment, Realme also started giving the Nokia display in India with its Relame C1 smartphone
 back panel kii baat karen to yahaan is segment ke duusare kai smartfones kii tarah hi plastic kaa upyog gaya he
 Here, the signature diamond cut design of Reality is provided with matte texture in the back
 jo dikhne main acha he, lekin hamen plastic kii quality itani pasand nahin ai
 Whereas Realme C1 and Realme C2 launched earlier by Realme were also budget smartphones and their back panel was quite attractive
 ek acchhee baat ye he ki isamen do sim saport ke saath hi ek microesady card slot bhi milegaa
 3 in the bottom panel here
 5mm headphone jaik, micro USB charging port or spikar gril diya gaya he
 Overall the look of this smartphone is quite good
 software kii baat karen to ye smartphone android 9 pai besd Color OS V6
 Runs at 0
 saath hi isamen 5 may 2019 tak android security ptch bhi diya gaya he
 Talking about the software, it has a UI with updated Color OS
 yahaan kaaphi pre-loded eps hai, haalanki inhen delit kiya ja saktaa he
 Which is a better thing
 company ne yahaan shortkat buttens main google assistant ke liye batan ko aid kiya he
 Which is usually not seen
 saath hi yahaan ap trey bhi diya gaya he
 Talking about the processor, here 12nm production process based 2
 0ghz kii speed vaala mediatek Helio P60 procesar diya gaya he or ye zyada lag nahin kar rahaa he
 That is, in terms of price is fine
 camera kii baat karen to yahaan rier main 13MP or 2MP ke camere die gaye hai or front main 8MP camera diya gaya he
 Which we liked in terms of price during the day
 rier camera potrate or regular shots main behatar riect kar rahaa he
 White balance is also better in auto mode
 HDR kaa rispons behatar he
 But i would like to add one thing of selfie that the pictures are getting much better here in beauty mode, but in normal mode and portrait mode the software is reacting incorrectly
 bydaree kii baat karen to jaisaa ki hamane upar bataaya ki yahaan 4,230mah kii badi bydaree di gai he, jo ki on paper kaaphi behatar lag rahaa he
 We will tell you the full review of this smartphone soon

 The Congress has run a masterstroke to give separate religion status to practice Lingayats

 In such a situation, the RSS has taken over the responsibility of practicing Lingayats from the BJP
 sangh ke varisht prachaarak pichley 15 dinon se lingayat bahul ilaakon main deraa jamaaye hue hai

 The same government is in power in Karnataka, in whose favor these communities vote unitedly
 janata dal ke ramakrishna hegade hon yaa congress ke virendra patil
 But the Lingayats did not vote for the Congress after Rajiv Gandhi insulted Patil and removed him as Chief Minister
 hegade ke baad yediurppa unke pasandida netaa bane, lekin 2011 main siem ke pad se unhen hataaya to lingayat samudaay kaa bijepi se mohabhang ho gaya

 However, Veerashaiva is angry with Siddaramaiah's move and is accusing Siddaramaiah of dividing Hinduism

 As the Punjab election date draws near, political parties have started associating themselves with the state's extremist history
 ye koi asaadhaaran baat bhi nahin he
 Small shopkeepers in the Sikh heartland are openly selling Tshirts that have a picture of extremist leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale killed in Operation Bluestar
 hai
 There are also calendarers with photographs of Sikh extremists killed in security operations in the eighties and nineties
 lekin graahakon main bhindrawaale ke pratikon kii sabase zyada maang he
 a shopkeeper in Amritsar said on condition of anonymity that posters, T-shirts and photos of extremists are in demand, so we are selling them

 After which these symbols started appearing again about a decade and a half ago
 2003 main jab shiromani akali dal ke netaa prakaash singh badal ko congress ke captain amarinder singh se satta ganvaae ek saal hi hua tha, tab amritsar main sikh dharmik maamalon kii sarvocch sanstha akaal takht ne bhindrawaale ko 'shahid' ghoshit kiya tha
 The head of the Akal Takht is appointed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC)
 esajipisi kaa niyantran tab prakaash singh badal ke shiromani akali dal ke paas tha jo ki ab bhi unheen ke paas he
 Despite Khalistani symbols, slogans, and the martyr status of Bhindranwale in 2003, those seeking Sikh homeland had long ceased to gain support in Punjab
 nabbe ke dashak ke madhya se rajya ke chunaavon menkhalistaan kabhi charchaa kaa bindu nahin rahaalekin mukhya dhara ke raajnneetik dalon par lagaataar algaavvaadiyon main dilchaspee lene ke aarope lagate rahe
 The 2017 election in the state is no different

 Opponents are accusing Kejriwal that he is in contact with pro-khalistan elements present in the migrant Sikhs
 ateet main aise hi aarope or pratyarope badal parivaar or captain amarinder singh ek-duusare par bhi lagaate rahe hai
 Two factions in support of Khalistan are currently two factions advocating for Khalistan in Punjab
 jinamein se ek dal khalsa he jo bhartiya samvidhan main nishtha nahin hone kii baat kahata he
 The second is the Shiromani Akali Dal (amritsar) of Simranjit Singh Mann, which has been struggling in electoral politics for many years
 shiromani akali dal (amritsar) ke rukh ke vipareet dal khalsa rajya yaa rashtriya chunaavon main hissaa nahin letaa
 Khalsa Dal spokesperson Kanwarpal Singh says that we boycott elections under the Indian system
 kanvarpal singh ke mutabik unke gut kaa kisi bhi raajnneetik dal se pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh sambandh nahin he
 Kanwarpal Singh said that we are advocates of independent, sovereign Punjab
 ham chaahate hai ki sikhon ko aatmanirnay kaa adhikaar diya jaae
 The Khalsa Dal holds the Badal family responsible for the alleged misuse of SGPC and other religious institutions
 saath hi khud ko badal parivaar kaa kadaa virdohi bataata he
 In the eyes of the Khalsa party, the Aam Aadmi Party is also no different
 kanvarpal singh ne kaha ki AAP punjab samarthak yaa panth (sikh samudaay) samarthak nahin he balki rashtriya soch vaali bharat samarthak party he
 We are completely different from each other
 videsh main baithe haashie par pahunche khalistaani netaa bhi khalsa dal kii vichaardhaara kaa hi samarthan karte hai
 On many occasions he is also seen protesting against the visiting Indian Sikh leaders (irrespective of party)
 unhone badal pita-putr se lekar captain amarinder singh or purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh, sabhi kaa virodh kiya he
 For example, Sikhs for Justice, a New York-based institution, even accused Manmohan Singh of funding humanitarian crimes against the Sikh community in India when he was finance minister
 punjab main badalon ne jis tarah se dharmik muddon ko handle kiya usase unhen ab udaaravaadi sikhon ke virodh kaa bhi saamana karnaa pad rahaa he kyonki samudaay kesarvocch dharmik prashasan esajipisi kaa niyantran bhi unheen ke paas he
 The Akal Takht was also questioned by the influential faction of liberal Sikhs when the Akal Takht announced the pardon of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim in 2015
 gurmeet ram rahim par guru gobind singh jaisi poshaak pahanane kii vajah se dharmik brudabi kaa aarope tha
 Many Sikhs believe that the script of apology to Gurmeet Ram Rahim was prepared by the clouds
 haalanki badal parivaar ne hameshaa aise aaropon kaa khandan kiya
 The decision to pardon the Akal Takht was later withdrawn due to the opposition of the Sikhs, but by then its institutional credibility had come to an end
 esajipisi kii ek varisht sadsy kiranjot cor kaa kahana he ki jo log apni aasthaa ko lekar phikr karte hai or apni dharmik sansthaaon kii pratishtha kii bahaali chaahate hai, unhen charampanthi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 It is their right to remove irregularities from the system while working in a democratic way

 When the Medical Council of India (MCI) recommended not to admit 80 seats for MBBS in five government medical colleges in Madhya Pradesh two years ago, the medical education was exposed again
 2011 main india today ne pradesh ke medical collejon kii bigadi sehat kaa khulaasa kiya tha or kareeb saadhe teen saal baad aaj bhi sthiti main koi sudhaar nahin hua he
 About 800 students take admission in 6 government medical colleges of the state every year
 2013 main emsiai ne indore, gwalior, bhopal or jabalpur sthit medical collejon main embibies kii siten 140 se badhaakar 150 or reva medical college main 60 se badhaakar 100 kar di thim
 Due to this, the hopes of the state to get 80 additional doctors annually, have been shocked by the latest recommendation of MCI

 Kushwaha says, "MCI is there to see the level

 Earlier too, due to lack of Talwakhali posts and other facilities, in 2006, MCI recommended to end the accreditation of Jabalpur and Rewa Medical Colleges

 This list has been finalized on January 1, 2015
 iske mutabik pradesh ke sabhi medical collejon main enotomi main sahaayak praadhyaapak ke sweekrut sabhi 29 pad saal 2010 se hi rikt hai
 Similarly, all 11 posts of Assistant Professor of Biochemistry and all 17 posts of Assistant Professor are vacant

 In such a situation, the posts of professor will remain vacant
 "vikalp bahutereyaisi koi vajah nahin he jo chikitsa shikshakon ko sarkari medical collejon main roke rakhane ke liye kaaphi ho
 The increasing number of private medical colleges has conflated the options
 yahi kaaran he ki nae shikshak aana to dur, puraane shikshak bhi naukari chhodkar ja rahe hai
 The discrepancy in benefits such as promotion and promotion in government medical colleges is also the reason for the shortage of teachers

 "the service condition is very bad," says Dwivedi, with issues like promotions and promotions over the years
 " pradesh main sahaayak praadhyaapak ko praadhyaapak banane main 20 saal lag jate hai
 In Delhi's Aquas, PGI Chandigarh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, the assistant professor becomes a co-professor in six years but it takes 12 years
 sah-praadhyaapak se praadhyaapak banane main bhi anya jagah 5 se 7 saal lagate he lekin madhya pradesh main 8 varsh
 As a result, there is a serious shortage of assistant professors and co-professors in government medical colleges in the state
 pradarshak ke rup main kaam kar rahe embibies ke liye padonnati kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he, isse unki tarakkee ruk jaati he
 The state government rules that anyone who did not get promotion in 8 or 16 years is given higher salary

 Kushwaha says, "this is a policy of governance, what can we do in this? By the way, the exhibitors have been working for 20-25 years, what is the harm if they are getting benefits?" The real problem is not noticed, the available seats continue to enter MCI assesses colleges annually to keep

 His statements have challenged Anupam Kher, an actor often in the news
 unhone kaha ki agar anupam kher main dam he to wo unhen or bijepi saansad yogi adityanath ko jail bhejkar dikhaaen
 Actually, Anupam Kher recently said during a program that there are some leaders in BJP who have been talking nonsense, whether it is Sadhvi or Yogi
 unhen jail main daal dena chahie or party se nikaal dena chahie
 Responding to the statement of the actor, 'the battle for the interest of Hindus will continue', Sadhvi Prachi said, 'we will continue the fight for the interest of Hindus
 agar kher main takat he to wo hamen jail bhejkar dikhaaen
 Prior to this, Kher's statement was also reacted by Adityanath, and said that Kher is playing the role of a villain not only in the film world but also in his personal life

 phir snaan-dhyaan karte hai, yoga karte hai
 Some of his cows are also reported to be taken to CM residence, whose service is an important part of Yogi Yogi's life

 isamen do baar to andh bhakthi main leen bhakton ne apane sant ko police kii giraftaar se bachaane ke liye nanga naach kiya
 At the same time, the most prosperous and powerful caste of the state kept taking the law in their hands to demand reservation, but all the people sitting in power did not matter

 What the Jat community did with the demand for reservation was embarrassing for the state
 jat andolankariyon ne dukaanon, makaanon or sansthaanon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya tha
 There was an orgy of miscreants on the streets and people were becoming victims of them, buses, trains and other vehicles were being introduced and looted openly
 is hinsa main 30 se zyada logon kii jaan gai he or lagbhag 20 hajaar karod rupee se adhik kii sampatti kaa nuksaan hua

 The devotion of Rampal devotees dates back to 2014 when there was a government led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda in the state

 Sant Rampal's comment on a book written by Swami Dayanand in 2006 led to violent clashes between Arya Samaj and supporters

 The saint connection of power is the alliance between the political party in the province and the saints who thrive on the state's land in such a way that both work as a shield for each other
 raajnneetik dal satta ke singhaasana par virajman hone ke liye jahaan inkaa samarthan lete hai
 In such a situation, they refrain from taking tough measures against them
 ise unki majaburi kaha jaae yaa phir satta kii laalasaa
 When their people mess with the law and order of the state, the people sitting on the throne of power only give a show

 The controversy over the collegium for a long time has not completely stopped
 centre sarkaar ne ek baar phir hoicourt kaa jaj banane ke liye kii gai supreme court ke colegium kii siforeeshon ko vichaar ke liye lautaa diya he
 In this, two lawyers were recommended to be High Court judges
 ye hairat kii baat he ki sarkaar ne siforishein phir se vichaar ke liye lautaate hue koi vajah bhi nahin bataai he
 In fact, the Collegium of the three top judges of the Supreme Court in 2016 recommended lawyer Harnaresh Singh Gill to the Punjab and Haryana High Court and Mohammad Nizamuddin to be the judge of the Calcutta High Court
 isse pehle bhi sarkaar ne kai hoicourt ke liye colegium ke bheje naamon main se ek naam phir se vichaar ke liye lautaaya tha
 But then the government also gave the reason behind this
 supreme court colegium ne elahabaad hoicourtke jaj ke liye supreme court ke ek purv jaj ke bete mohammad mansoor kaa naam bheja tha
 But the government had returned the file for reconsideration in the name citing the reasons for the complaints against them
 mohammad mansoor supreme court ke purv jaj justise sagir ahamed ke bete hai
 The government also returned the name of another lawyer Basharat Ali Khan with the same file
 sarkaar ne abhi jin siforeeshon kii file colegium ko phir se vichaar ke liye lautaai hai unamem jammu kashmir hoicourt ke liye prastaavit nazeer ahamed beg kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 But the government is taking further action in the name of Nazir Ahmed Beg, who was sent to the lot in the name of advocate Wasim Siddique Nargal, Sindhu Sharma and Rashid Ali Dar, who has been promoted to High Court by the District Judge
 yani inke liye supreme court colegium kii sifarish par sarkaar ko koi aapatti nahin hui
 However, even after returning Baig's file, the government has not given any reason
 sarkaar ne isi saal april main uttarakhand hoicourt ke chif justise ke em joseph ko supreme court laane kii sifarish vaali file bhi colegium ko lautaa di thi
 It is a different matter that the Collegium has again recommended the intention to bring Joseph to the Supreme Court and send the file back to the government

 un sapanom kaa dard jo sari zindagi unke gharavaalon ko sataata rahegaa, jo bachche is hamale main batch bhi gaye hai, kya ve is haadase ko kabhi bhul paaegein
 They will forget that their friends were killed only because the fear of some people remains in the country and the world

 So, should we assume that the Pakistani army is really under the terror of terror? matlab kii jis paudhe ko usne khaad pani dekar sinchaa, ab use kaatane kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 These stalls will be open from 10 am to 5 pm, in which only 2 kg of onion will be given to each person
 vahiin, sasti pyaaj milane se graahak bhi kaaphi khush hai
 Ananya, who came to take onions from four tamarinds, said that in the morning when she read in the newspaper that onions would be sold at the rate of 50 rupees in Bitton market, she came here with her sister to get onions
 ananyaa ne bataaya ki yahaan milane vaala pyaaj bahut acchhee quality kii he jo baahar kareeb 90 rupee kilo main bik rahi he
 At the same time, the effect of the administration selling cheap onions has also started showing
 bittan market main anya vyapaariyon ne prashasan ke rate se kam daam main pyaaj bechnaa bhi shuru kar diya he, jiske jawaab main shashan kaa kahana he ki unka makasad hi pyaaj kii oonchi keemat ko kam karnaa he

 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko uttar pradesh main kaman sanbhale ek saal puraa hone ja rahaa he
 Before the completion of one year in power, the Yogi government organized Uttar Pradesh's first investor summit on the lines of the Gujarat model, and invited the world's biggest businessmen to invest in the state
 is maukey par rajdhani lakhanu pahunche birla, reliance or adani jaise samoohon ke pramukhon ne ek baat saaf shabdon main kahi ki vah uttar pradesh ke liye bade nivesh kaa elaan isliye kar rahe hai kyonki bina uttar pradesh ko aarthik gatividhiyon ke kendra main rakhe bharat ko vishwa str par aarthik shakti ke taur par nahin khadaa kiya ja saktaa he
 China too, with the help of its big states, economic power: China, the world's largest economic power, is going through a period of lethargy
 lagaataar 30 saal tak 10 fisadi kii vikaas dar darj karne vaale china ko aarthik shakti banane main uske kuch provinces kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 These states also contribute the most to the country's GDP
 khaas baat yah he ki aarthik aankadon ko dekhakar saaf he ki ye provins china kii sabase ghani aabaadi vaale kshetra hai or is ghani aabaadi ke sahare hi china duniya kii sabase badi arthvyavastha banane main safal hua he
 Read this: Yogi Sarkar's report is hidden in the answer to these 10 questions asked by the ministers: The Gujarat model is expected from the platform of investors summit in Uttar Pradesh, one person after another and the potential investors reminded the scene of 2003 when Gujarat After taking command, the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation of Vibrant Gujarat
 lakhanu ke manch par daawa kiya gaya ki wibront gujarat summit ne gujarat main bade nivesh kaa rasta kholte hue gujarat ko kaarobaar main desh kaa agrani rajya bana diya
 Therefore, Uttar Pradesh will be made an important commercial area of the country following this pattern
 bharat main jansankhya ke hisaab se sarvaadhik aabaadi vaala rajya uttar pradesh he
 Therefore, it is necessary for India to capture and overtake an economy like China that puts Uttar Pradesh at the center of economic development in India as well
 ise padhein: yogi kaa ek saal: pradesh ko nahin mila 3CM formule kaa phayda!ye companiyaan banaaengi upi ko industrial hub?upi inwesters summit ke manch se bolte hue desh ke bade udyogpatiyon ne agle kuch varshon main hajaaron karod ke nivesh ke saath-saath rajya main lakhon nae rojgaar paidaa karne kaa daawa kiya he
 Among them, if Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of the state's biggest investor Aditya Birla Group, claimed an investment of Rs 25,000 crore in the state's economic activities, then the country's largest businessman Mukesh Ambani, with an investment of Rs 10,000 crore in three years, invested one lakh
 Claimed to provide more jobs than
 vahiin summit main shirkat kar rahe adani samooh ke pramukh gautam adani ne agle kuch varshon ke dauraan rajya main apni companiyon ke vistaar ke liye kul 45,000 karod rupee ke nivesh kaa daawa kiya he
 Apart from these, foreign companies have announced large investments in the state during Uttar Pradesh's Everest Summit
 gauratlab he ki mahaj deyari sector main netherland samet europe kii companiyon ne lagbhag 500 samjhaute karte hue hajaaron karod ke nivesh kaa khaakaa pesh kiya he
 Now it remains to be seen whether this Investor Summit of Uttar Pradesh, like Vibrant Gujarat, is successful in changing the economic picture of the state? If these big economic investments clear the way in the coming years and the Gujarat model gets success in UP, then Uttar Pradesh will be seen playing an important role in the coming days to match China
