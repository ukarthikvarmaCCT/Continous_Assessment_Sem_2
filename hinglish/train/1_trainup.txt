 Pakistan is restless after the Modi government's decision on Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu kashmir ko mila vishesh darja hataane ke baad pakistan ko bharat se yuddh kaa dar sata rahaa he
 This is the reason that from the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the Army Chief and all the leaders are talking about war
 is bich khabar yah he ki pakistan ab bharat kii flites ke liye apana airspes band kar saktaa he
 According to Pakistani media, Pakistan is preparing to pressure India on the Kashmir issue

 However, so far there has been no official statement from Pakistan regarding the closure of airspace
 iske pehle pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne kaha ki yadi bharat ke saath yuddh hota he to ham iske liye puri tarah taiyaar hai
 Due to this, Pakistan has increased the army on its eastern border
 vahiin, pakistan main kattarpanthi sanghathan modi sarkaar ke jammu kashmir par liye gaye faisle ke khilaaf sadakon par utar aae hai
 In many cities of Pakistan including Peshawar, Lahore, Karachi, rallies were taken out against the decision of the Modi government

 sabhi students ne ajtak kaa aabhaar jataayaa or kaha ki ab unhen insaaf mil gaya he
 The College of Management and Management in Rohtak's College of 13 students in Kashmir was fired in March for the reason that their scholarship under the Prime Minister's Special Scholarship Scheme did not get their scholarship, so the college management cannot afford it
 isliye yaa to khud fees jamaa karaaen yaa phir college ko chhod den
 Two months ago these students left college and since then they were spending their days living in a rented room in Rohtak
 ajtak ne jab inke saath hui ninsaphi ko dikhaaya, to prashasan main hadakamp much gaya
 VC of Rohtak Deputy Commissioner and MD University immediately took cognizance of the matter and issued guidelines to the college management
 yahi nahin peedit chaatro ne pradhanmantri, maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri or jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri ko bhi patr likhaa
 Aaj Tak supported him at every step and that is why he got admission in the college today and now he can also give his exam next month
 college ke nideshak kishor chawla ne bataaya ki sabhistudents kalegemen apni padhai jari rakh sakate hai or niyamit taur par kakshaen bhi laga sakate hai
 They have exams next month
 college prabandhan kii aisi koi manshaa nahin he ki inke bhavishya ke saath kisi tarah kaa koi khilwaad ho
 His scholarship has not come yet, although the college has assisted him many times, but now he cannot bear them
 hamane kabhi inhen college se nahin nikaala, inako puraa sahyog kiya jayega
 Two months later, there is joy on the face of these students, the college called them back and allowed them to hold classes
 haalanki abhi tak inhen hostel main rahane kii anumati nahin mili he
 Giving thanks to Aaj Tak, all the students said that their ruined future has been saved and conveyed their voice to the ministry

 apane america daure ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne raashtrapati donald trump se mulaakaat kii
 The whole world was watching this tour
 mulaakaat ke dauraan trump or modi main shandaar camestry dikhi, to vahiin donon deshon ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladane kii baat kahi
 This visit of Modi caused a lot of trouble to China
 china kii ore se kaha gaya he ki america bharat ko china ke khilaaf ek tul kii tarah istemaal kar rahaa he, america ne kabhi bhi suraksha parishad main bharat kii jagah ke liye koi thos daavedaari nahin kii he
 America's trap is this friendship
 In an article published in the official newspaper Global Times, it was said in a note from the US that India was a true friend of America, which made it clear that America was new to targeting Beijing
 Will use Delhi
 akhbaar main likhaa he ki bharat bhale hi is par thodaa garv mahasoos kar saktaa he ki vah america kaa ahm saathi ban rahaa he, lekin yah america kii ore se ek trep he
 In which India is being used
 kya trump dilaayenge suraksha parishad main seat?china ne kaha ki aakhir abhi tak jameen par kya hua he, baraak obama ne apane kaarykaal main bharat ko suraksha parishad main seat dilwane kaa vaada kiya tha
 But did anything practical happen on this promise, no
 par kya is daure ke baad trump bharat ko seat dilavaayenge, yah bhi ek sawaal he
 The article said that the question arises as to whether Trump will put pressure on Pakistan on terrorist organizations, due to which he is accused
 agar iskaa jawaab dekhen, to yah negative main dikhataa he
 India not a friend like japan-australia! The article has written that India and America are getting so close due to the rise of China
 lekin bharat china kaa utana acha dost nahin he, jitne ki australia or japan he
 The US is getting closer to India only because of China

 Prior to the Kabul conference, Russia, while supporting India's stand, made it clear that "there is no good or bad Taliban

 'sahitya ajtak' ke duusare din hallaa bol chaoupal par pehle satr 'dilli jo ek shahar tha' kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 The session was attended by historian Dr
 Swapna Liddle along with writer and poet Dr
 Saif Mahmood
 is kaarykram main jaisaa satr ke naam se jaahir he dilli kii viraasat or samskruti par charchaa kii gai
 The mood of the city of Delhi was discussed in detail during this session
 saath hi shero-shaayari ke us daur ko bhi yaad kiya jab mirza gaalib dilli kii galiyon main ghumaa karte the
 Historian Swapna Liddle told that what did not change in that period of Delhi and today's Delhi is that even then people used to come here from every city and even today they are coming from every corner
 dilli main jo bhi log aae or bas gaye wo apane saath apana khaanaa, jubaan, pahanava saath lekar aae hai
 He said that the same thing is reflected in literature and works
 cinema main mahilaon ko kamedi ke naam par prastut karnaa galat: prasoon joshidesh-duniya kaa bhraman karne vaale saf mahmud ne dilli ke basane or ujadane ko lekar mir kaa sher sunaate hue kaha, 'dil or dilli donon agar hai kharaab, to kuch lutf is ujde ghar main bhi hai
 He said that a great period of Urdu literature went through pain and oppression, on the example, Faiz wrote his best Kalam while in prison
 unhone kaha ki dilli sirf ek shahar nahin balki ek tahjeeb kaa naam he
 Delhi is changing
 
 
 dil waalon kii dilli kya aaj ke daur main badal gai he
 In response to this question, the historian Swapna said that the stress and urbanization of the people is also the reason for changing their mood
 logon ko khuli hawa main saans nahin mil paa rahi he
 The kind of city we are building is having an effect on our mind and it has nothing to do with culture or civilization

 vishesh rup se pashchimi maharashtra or marathavada ke saansadon ko dar he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye shivasena or bijepi alag-alag maidan main utrenge, to donon partiyon ko nuksaan hoga
 At the same time, on Monday, bjp's State Core Committee meeting will be held in Jalana, Maharashtra

 Meanwhile, Shiv Sena also raised the issue of Ram temple
 yah sochate hue ki jaldbaaji main bijepi chunaav se pehle is mudde ko hal karne ke liye adhyadesh paarit karegi, jo gathbandhan ke liye rasta saaf kar saktaa he, lekin pradhanmantri ne adhyadesh laane ke kisi bhi vichaar se inkaar kar diya
 Speaking at a BJP worker meeting in Maharashtra a few days before Amit Shah's statement came to a halt, BJP president Amit Shah told the party workers that if there is an alliance, the party will ensure the victory of its allies and if it does not The party will defeat its former allies in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections

 ye to ham sabhi jaanate hai ki maa kaa doodh bachche ke liye amrit samaan hota he
 It protects the child from many diseases and helps in its development
 janm ke baad kuch maheenon tak bachche kaa pachan tantra itnaa viksit nahin hota he ki wo kuch kha sake yaa pi sake
 In this case, the child is completely dependent on the mother's milk
 maa ke doodh main lagbhag sabhi poshak tatv maujuud hote hai
 But only few people will know that it is important to pay attention to some special things while getting breastfeed
 ye hai wo baaten jin par dhyaan dena he jaruri:1
 The mother may have pain while having breastfeed
 is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki ye us mahila kaa pehla baccha he yaa phir doosraa
 It takes a week or two for the mother to adjust for this
 aise main usko maansik rup se taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 2
 brestfid karaane ke dauraan yaa uske baad sharir ke duusare hisson main bhi dard ho saktaa he
 But this pain does not last long
 kuch dinon baad ye khud hi dur ho jaataa he
 3
 kai baar khud hi risaav ho saktaa he
 There is no need to panic in this situation
 yah saamaanya he
 4
 ho saktaa he ki brestfid karaane ke dauraan aapaki bhukh achaanak se bad jaae
 5
 brestfid karaane ke dauraan takie kaa istemaal karnaa suvidhajanak rahata he
 Use pillows to support the child
 6
 Children get hungry very often
 ho saktaa he brestfid karaane ke kuch der baad hiuse dobaaraa se bhukh lag jaae
 There is no need to panic in this situation
 7
 Do not rely on formula milk or any other milk instead of breastfeed
 maa ke doodh se badhkar kuch bhi nahin

 ’’ Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat is the head of the whole family and if the head itself opens the box of education then it will not be wrong to understand that there is something wrong in the family
 mauka tha sangh ke mukhpatr panchajnya or organizer ke locarpan kaa
 But Bhagwat could not afford to listen to all the camps on the precipice of the party on the pretext of inauguration
 ab bijepi ke bhishma pitamah adwani darshak ddeergha me maujuud the to sabase pehla sandesh shaayad unke hi naam rahaa
 Bhagwat said that change is an invariant rule
 ye hitkaari ho isliye aparivartaniya kaa dhyaan bhi rakhana padataa he
 The signal was clear to accept the change
 haalanki bhagwat ne ghaavon par ye kah malaham lagane kii koshish bhi kii ki yuvavastha main bhatakane kii shakti hoti he lekin budhaape main bhatakane kaa saahas nahin hota
 Now it was the turn of the hidden message for Rajnath Singh and Modi
 bhagwat ne kaha ki anukool paristhiyon main zyada saavdhaanee rakhni padati he or paryaapt saavdhaanee se chalanaa padataa he
 That does not require much confidence
 haalanki sarasanghachaalak kaa aglaa sandesh un netaaon ke liye tha to lahar kii sochakar hi hawa main ud rahe hai
 Bhagwat said that the kite wanders open in the sky only when there is a door in someone's hand at the bottom and if the door comes out of the hand, the kite will not be able to recover
 bhagwat ne do took kaha ki mat alag alag ho sakate hai lekin man alag nahin hone dena he
 It is tradition to debate and issues can be resolved through debate
 lekin is prakaar kaa vaataavaran nahin dikhataa
 It is evident that the head of the family is hurt by the tension of the BJP leaders going through the media
 haalanki apana bhaashan khatm karte karte bhagwat thode naram padate bhi najar aae
 Bhagwat said in gestures that people are upset with the Congress
 jahaan aadhaar dikhataa he vahaan ja rahe hai or unka nity samaran hota he
 Bhagwat said that the journey in which we are engaged ourselves will be successful
 yani jeet kii ummid ke saath bhagwat ne bijepi ko lakshya puraa karne main lag jane kaa sandesh bhi de diya
 Now Bhagwat had come to launch the mouthpiece of the Sangh but it is clear from these messages that the Sangh is not happy with the bjp's discord

 In the politics of Mahasangramchacha-nephew in the politics of Maharashtra, Jungsharad did in 1987 in the game of power of Baghavatmaharashtra, Ajit Pawar is following the footsteps of his uncle NCP chief Sharad Pawar
 congress-shivasena-ensipi sarkaar banane ke liye manthan hi kar rahe the ki ajit pavaar ne sharad pavaar se baghawat kar bijepi ke saath haath milakar sarkaar bana lee
 Ajit Pawar has revived the 41-year-old incident when Sharad Pawar became the CM in collaboration with the Janata Party, giving a jolt to Congress leader Vasantdada Patil in 1978 and the Congress kept watching
 maharashtra ke taaja ghatnakram ke beet vasantdada patil kii patni shalini patil ne kaha ki sharad pavaar ke saath 'jaise ko taisa' vaali baat hui he
 The wife of Vasantdada Patil said, 'the manner in which Sharad Pawar treated Vasant Rao should have been treated like what Ajit Pawar has done with the BJP
 ' shalini patil ne kaha ki sharad pavaar ne 1978 main jo boyaa vahi kaat rahe hai, vah bhisatta hathiyaane ke liye peeth main khanjar maarane jaisaatha
 He said that instead of secretly rebelling Sharad Pawar, he could also speak directly to Vasant Dada Patil
 bataa den ki desh main apatkaal ke baad 1977 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii diggaj netaa or purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ko haar mili or janata party kii sarkaar bani thi
 In such a situation, even in Maharashtra, the Congress party lost many seats, due to which the then Chief Minister of the state Shankar Rao Chavan resigned from his post taking moral responsibility for the defeat
 aise main vasantdada patil unki jagah maharashtra ke siem bane the
 This was the period when the Congress broke up and the Congress (S) and Congress (I) split into two factions
 aise main sharad pavaar congress (es) main shaamil ho gaye the
 Assembly elections were held in Maharashtra in 1978 and both the Congress factions contested separately
 tab congress (es) ko 69 siten mili thim or congress (ai) ko 65 siten hasil hui thim
 However, the Janata Party won 99 seats
 is tarah se teenon hi dal apane dam par sarkaar gathan kii sthiti main nahin thi
 In such a situation, under the leadership of Vasantdada Patil, both factions of the Congress had decided to come together
 congress ke donon dhade milakar sarkaar banaati isse pehle hi sharad pavaar ne congress (es) ko tod diya
 Sharad Pawar had formed a government by forming a progressive Democratic Front with the Janata Party with 38 Congress (S) mlas
 is tarah se 37 saal ke umr main maharashtra ke sabase yuva mukhyamantri bane the
 Later Yashwantdada Patil also joined Sharad Pawar's party
 pavaar kii yah sarkaar do saal chali thi
 The Pawar-led government fell in February 1980 after Indira Gandhi returned to power
 haalanki baad main sharad pavaar bhi congress main vaapasi kar gaye the
 The politics of Maharashtra has once again turned and reiterated its 41-year-old history
 ajit pavaar ne bhi apane chachaa or guru sharad pavaar ke netritv vaali ensipi ko tod diya he or bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai he or dipti siem bane hai
 It is to be seen that how many NCP mlas are able to keep Ajit Pawar with them, because Sharad Pawar has become active to save the party

 ) In the active politics of Priyanka Gandhi, different statements of different leaders are coming out
 koi congress ke is faisle kii aalochana kar rahaa he to koi ise sahi kadam bataa rahaa he
 But the BJP MLA from Ballia in Uttar Pradesh crossed the threshold of criticism and called Priyanka Gandhi Vadra the surrender of the Ramayana
 darasal, mangalvaar ko bhaajapa vidhayak surendra singh ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko 'ravan' or unki bahan priyanka gandhi ko 'shurpanakha' bataaya he
 Let me tell you that Congress has made Priyanka Gandhi the general secretary of the party and has given her command of Eastern UP
 bairiya se bijepi vidhayak surendra singh ne patrkaar ke sawaal par kaha ki congress ek tuuti hui nauka ho chuki he
 She won in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh only due to SC-ST Act
 aap jaanate hai ki jab ram or ravan kaa yuddh hone vaala tha to pehle ravan ne apni bahan shurpanakha ko bheja tha
 Modi is in the role of Ram and Rahul in the role of Ravana who has landed his sister Shurpanakha
 maan kar chaliye ki lanka vijay ho gayi
 There is no doubt that Modi will again become the Prime Minister of India
 Siyasat ki zubaan aisi bhi hai

 Earlier, the BJP minister in Bihar also made a controversial statement on Priyanka Gandhi
 unhone kaha tha ki khubasurat chehron ke dam par vot nahin jite ja sakate
 Bihar Minister Vinod Narayan Jha said when Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was made Congress General Secretary, “votes cannot be won on the basis of beautiful faces
 
 
 isse bhi badhkar tathy yah he ki vah robert wadra kii patni hai, jin par bhoomi ghotaale or bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon main shaamil hone kaa aarope he
 She is very beautiful, but she has no political achievement other than that
 "darasal, upi main priyanka ko purvi upi kii kaman saunpane ke faisle ko loksabhaa chunaav or 2022 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke lihaaj se kaaphi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 Now the discussion has intensified that with the arrival of Priyanka, there has been a triangular contest in UP
 pehle sapa-basapa or sidhe bijepi ke bich ladaai thi, magar ab chunavi jang main congress waapas aa gai he
 Condemning the Saturday blasts in the capital Delhi, the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party said the United Progressive Alliance government lacked the will to tackle terrorism
 bhaajapa pravaktaa rajeev pratap rudi ne kaha ki lagata he ki samprag sarkaar keval aatankwaad par bahes karne kii icchhuk he lekin uske paas ise khatm karne kii ichhashakti nahin he
 bjp's prime ministerial candidate LK Advani said that the present government has completely failed to curb terrorism
 saath hi unhone kaha ki sarkaar pota nahin aatankwaad ko naa kah rahi he
 Vijay Kumar Malhotra, the BJP MP from South Delhi and the Chief Minister of Delhi, said that Home Minister Shivraj Patil is not able to stop the blasts in the country's capital, it is his jurisdiction
 isaki naitik jimmedaari lete hue patil ko apane pad se tatkaal istipha de dena chahie
 It is worth mentioning that on Friday, the BJP has appointed Malhotra as the Chief Ministerial candidate for Delhi
 bhaajapa ke pravaktaa ravi shankar prasad ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar centre main ai to ham pota se kadaa kanoon laaenge
 He said that the ISI is behind the explosion

 The Prime Minister is still doing vote bank politics
 rajdhani ke mahrauli ilaake main shanivaar ko hue ek visphot main ek bachche kii maut ho gai jabaki 18 anya ghayal ho gaye
 In a shocking incident in Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu, a Dalit youth was attacked by some people from the Vanniyar community
 20 saal ke ajit kumaar shanivaar ko jab apni bhabhi ke saath ghar kii ore waapas ja rahe the tabhi vanniar samudaay ke 5 logon ne unpar hamalaa kar diya
 Ajit Kumar, who was riding the bike, was first stopped by the accused and later attacked
 ajit kumaar ko pehle sanglass utaarne ko kaha gaya or bike ko paidal lekar gaanv tak chalane ko kaha
 When Ajit Kumar refused to accept his demand, an attacker named Gopi mistreated Ajit's sister-in-law
 iske baad tanaav or bad gaya
 Although Ajit Kumar and his sister-in-law were let go by the accused, but after some time Gopi and some of his associates attacked Ajit
 police ke mutabik ajit kumaar or unke pita par pathar phenke gaye
 According to the victim, he, his father and mother were attacked
 police ne maamle main gopi or paanch anya aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 He was booked under the Atrocities Against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act
 lekin isamen peedit or gaanvvaalon ke liye jo sabase chaunkaane vaali cheez rahi wo ajit kumaar kii giraftaar rahi
 Police arrested Ajit Kumar on the complaint of accused Gopi
 gopi or uske sahyogiyon ne aarope lagaaya ki ajit ne bhi unpar bhi hamalaa kiya
 However people from the Dalit community have accused the political parties of supporting the Vanniyar community and only working in their favor
 police ke adhikariyon ne safai dete hue kaha ki jo shikaayat mili he usee par ham karrwai kar rahe hai
 Officials claimed it was not a caste-based attack
 supreme court se raahat ke baad bijepi ke bies yediurppa ne karnataka ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath le lee he
 But it is only after he takes over the throne that the hour of his examination begins
 bijepi ke paas bahumat ke liye jaruri vidhayakon kii sankhya se 8 kam he
 In such a situation, proving majority is a big challenge in itself
 haalanki, bijepi ko supreme court main shuukravaar subah 10
 a list of supporting legislators is to be submitted at 30 pm
 aise main aaj hi din bachataa he
 Yeddyurappa is sworn in as Chief Minister
 iske baad unke saamne vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne kii chunauti he
 But before that they will have to pass the litmus test in the Supreme Court as well
 samarthan kaa patr court main shuukravaar ko rakhana hoga
 Let us know that in the results of 222 seats in the Karnataka assembly elections, BJP has got 104 seats, which is 8 mlas less than the majority
 congress ko 78 or jedies ko 37, basapa ko 1 or anya ko 2 siten mili hai
 In such a situation, BJP may have emerged as the largest party, but it is far from majority
 jabaki congress or jedies ne nattejey aane ke baad haath mila liya he
 While the BJP claimed to form the government as the largest party, the JDS and the Congress formed a coalition, citing the substantial number of mlas
 iske baad buudhvaar kii shaam karnataka ke rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa bheja or yediurppa ko 15 din main bahumat sabit karne kaa samay diya
 Yeddyurappane took oath as Chief Minister at 9 am on Thursday
 bijepi bahumat ko sabit karne ke liye 15 din kaa samay diya gaya he
 In such a condition, BJP got 10 in the Supreme Court on Friday morning
 30 baje samarthak vidhayakon kaa patr saunpna he
 While he has only 104 mlas
 aise main bijepi ko 8 vidhayakon kaa samarthan kaa aankada jutanaa ek badi chunauti he
 BS Yeddyurappa now has only one option left after the Chief Minister is sworn in, that the BJP can prove a majority by calling the Assembly Kasdan before the Supreme Court's deadline
 is ranneeti main bhi bijepi tabhi safal ho paaegi jab congress or jedies ke kareeb dhed darjan vidhayak bahumat ke dauraan sadan main upasthit na rahe
 At the same time, all the BJP mlas stayed in the House and voted in favor of the party
 bijepi ise karne main safal rahati he, to phir 112 vidhayakon kii list dene se batch sakati he
 Without a majority of the Legislative Assembly, the Supreme Court can get relief
 is tarah se yediurppa apni satta ke singhaasana kii kursi bachaa sakate hai
 Apart from this, there is no other way for BJP
 'krime capital' ke naam se badnaam hui dilli ek baar phir sharmasaar ho gai he
 a four-year-old girl has been raped in the national capital
 khabar he ki chaar saal kii ek ladki se uske padosi ne kathith rup se balaatkaar kiya
 Police said that the incident took place in Seemapuri
 vaardaat kaa aaropee faraar he
 When the girl's father saw her daughter's condition, she complained to the police
 police ne maamla darj kar liya he
 On the one hand, where CBI officials reached the house of Delhi cadet CM Manish Sisodiaq, on the other hand CM Arvind Kejriwal was doing a surprise inspection of government hospitals
 kejariwal ke saath dilli ke swasthya mantri satyendra jain bhi maujuud hai, jo marijon se aspataal main suvidhaon or vyavasthaaon kaa jayja le rahe the
 It is seen in the video found by 'aaj Tak' that Arvind Kejriwal is standing with a prescription form in his hand
 siem ke najdiki sutron ne bataaya ki vah marij se dawaai na hone kii shikaayat milane ke baad doctor kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 Further in the video, a woman doctor meets Kejriwal
 kejariwaldawai kaa parchaa dikhaate hue doctor ko kah rahe hai ki madam counter kii list main yah dawaai maujuud hi nahin he
 If there is no medicine, then why did the doctor prescribe? Call the doctor who has written this medicine
 video ke bich mahila doctor kejariwal ke saamne haath jodatii nazar aa rahi he
 Next, Kejriwal walks out of the hospital, showing the form of another patient, where a female doctor is present
 video main marij shikaayat kar rahaa he ki dawaai baahar medical se kharidne ke liye kaha ja rahaa he, jis par kejariwal doctor se puch rahe hai ki dawaai uplabdh na hone par kisase milanaa he, yah kahaan likhaa he? video ke aakhri main kejariwal ne doctor ko dawaai na uplabdh hone par ek board lagane kii naseehat dete hue health secretary ko nirdesh dete najar aa rahe hai
 It may be known that recently, CM Kejriwal issued instructions to the Chief Secretary, referring to the 50% shortage of medicines in hospitals in Delhi
 iske alaava dawaaiyon kii pement or rakrakhaav ko lekar bhi sawaal khadey hue the
 In such a situation, Kejriwal and Health Minister are constantly visiting hospitals, but seeing the picture, it is clear that patients are still not getting medicines in government hospitals
 aspataal prashasan bhi is par dhyaan nahin de rahaa he
 What is Talk to AK? - In late June 2016, the Delhi government decided that the Chief Minister would communicate directly with the public through Facebook, Google and youtube
 janata se sawaal maange jaaenge or unke jawaab die jaaenge
 For this, Information and Publicity Department (DIP) of Delhi Government was asked to publicize the program from July 8
 - diypi kaa jawaab aayaa ki unke paas utyub, fasebuk, google ityadi ke jariye prachaar-prasar ke sansaadhan nahin he
 - That's why the Perfect Relations of the Consultant Agency already working with the Delhi Government were asked whether they were able to do this work? - Perfect Relations said that Google, Facebook, youtube are the medium, There is no competition
 ye duniya bhar main apni tarah kii iklauti companiyaan he
 Therefore, they cannot have any tender competition for advertising
 - kansaltent company parfect relation ne kaha ki google, fasebuk, utyub se unke dwaara nirdhaarit rate par ye kaam wo kara sakati he
 - Consultant Company Perfect Relations gave its proposal on 6 July
 - sarkaar ne parfect relation ko ye kaam nimna 3 sharton ke saath diya
 - Consultant company will give an intertexting that the rates fixed by Facebook, youtube and Google are minimum and non-negotiable
 kansaltent company in companiyon se kisi bhi tarah kii riyasat, chhot yaa kamishan nahin legi or agar kansaltent ko kisi tarah kii riyasat, chhot yaa kamishan yaa or kisi bhi tarah kaa phayda miltaa he, to vah uske bilon se kaat liya jayega
 - For this work, the consultant company will not be given any kind of charge except the terms and conditions available with the contract with DIP
 - sarkaar iske liye koi advance pement nahin degi or na hi real time time pement diya jayega
 Payment will be made only after depositing the actual bill
 - is maamle main diypi ne 8 july 2016 ko is sambandh main puri jaankaree kii fil dilli sarkaar ke vitt vibhaag ko bheja
 On 11 July 2016, the Finance Department did these things and asked that the department take it for cabinet approval
 - 17 july ko ye kaarykram sucharu rup se sampann hua
 On the proposal of the Finance Department, the entire matter was put up for approval of the cabinet on September 1 and its payment was approved by the cabinet
 - purv up-rajyapal shri najeeb jang ne is maamle main sibiai cese darj kara diya
 - Do not understand where the scam happened when the government successfully did this work without any additional payment to the already working consultant agency without cost to cost, machine and advance payment? - Is cost to cost without commission work? Karana is a scam? - Is the Chief Minister's Facebook, youtube dialogue with the public through Google a scam? aarthik rup se kamjor varg (edablyooes) main nursery main pravesh chaahane vaale jin bacchon ko drow ke jariye purvottar dilli kaa east point skool aavantit kiya gaya tha, unke mata-pita is samay duvidha main hai kyonki is skool ne apane yahaan uplabdh siton kii sankhya ke bare main shiksha nideshaalay ko galat jaankaree di thi
 Padmini Singhal, director of the Directorate of Education, said, "all schools were asked to inform us about the number of seats available in the nursery and KG in their respective institutions
 vasundhara ankalev ke da east point skool ne khaali siton ke bajaay galati se kul seat sankhya kii jaankaree de di thi
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘chunki dikhaai gai siton kii sankhya uplabdh siton se zyada thi, isliye computer se nikaale gaye drow main zyada chaatro ko skool kaa aavanton kar diya gaya
 This matter has been brought to our notice and measures are being taken for this
 ’’ Singhal said, "after the admission of the first list is complete, we will give students admission in schools, considering the priority list based on distance
 ’’ is uljhan ne mata-pita ko mushkil main laa diya he kyonki skool prashasan unase kah rahaa he ki siten pehle hi bhar chuki hai
 Sonpal's son was allotted this school for admission in KG class
 sonpal ne kaha, ‘‘main 10 din se vahaan ja rahaa hum or hamen get se hi yah kahkar waapas bhej diya jaataa he ki siten bhar chuki hai
 There is a line of parents battling with this problem outside the school every day
 yadi siten pehle se hi bhar gai thim to phir mere bete ko skool aavantit kyon kiya gaya?’’ sampark kiye jane par, skool prashasan ne kaha ki siten puri bhar jane ke kaaran ve or zyada chaatro ko pravesh nahin de sakate
 The comments skool prashasan kii varisht adhikari kanupriya ne kaha, ‘‘jo bhi abhibhavak yahaan aate hai, ham sabhi ko bataa rahe hai ki siten pehle se hi bhar chuki hai
 Parents are wasting their time and school administration time by queuing up outside the school
 ham unhen salaah dete hai ki ve shiksha nideshaalay se sampark karen
 Meanwhile, the department has extended the last date for completing the admission again
 shiksha nideshaalay ne skulon ko jari ek circular main kaha, ‘‘yah baat sangyaan main ai he ki 29 farvari tak kaa vistaar die jane ke baavjood adhiktar gaiyr sahaayta praapt nijee skulon ne computerikrut drow ke jariye chune gaye edablyooes:diji varg ke chaatro ke shuruaati kakshaon main pravesh kii prakriya puri nahin kii he
 "it was said in the circular," Now the last date for giving admission has been extended to 18 March
 sabhi skulon ko nirdesh die jate hai ki ve tab tak prakriya ko puraa kar len
 '' shiksha nideshaalay kii nideshak padmini singhl ne bataaya, ‘‘sabhi skulon se kaha gaya tha ki ve apane-apane sansthaanon main nursery or keji main uplabdh seat sankhya ke bare main hamen jaankaree den
 The East Point School in Vasundhara Enclave mistakenly reported the total seat number instead of vacant seats
 ’’ He said, "since the number of seats shown was more than the seats available, the school was allocated more students in computer-drawn draws
 yah maamla hamaare sangyaan main laayaa gaya he or iske liye upaay kiye ja rahe hai
 '' singhl ne kaha, ‘‘pehali suchi ke pravesh puure ho jane ke baad, ham duuri ke aadhaar par chaatro kii praathamikta suchi ko dekhte hue unhen skulon main pravesh denge
 "this confusion has made parents difficult because the school administration is telling them that seats have already been filled
" sonpal ke bete ko keji kaksha main pravesh ke liye yah skool aavantit hua tha
 Sonpal said, "I have been going there for 10 days and we are sent back from the gate saying that the seats are full
" rojaanaa skool ke baahar isi pareshaani se jujh rahe mata-pita kii line lagi rahati he
 If the seats were already filled then why was my son allotted the school? ”when contacted, the school administration said that they could not admit more students because the seats were full
 tippaniyan Senior school administration officer Kanupriya said, "whatever parents come here, we are telling everyone that seats have already been filled
" skool ke baahar kataren lagaakar mata-pita apana or skool prashasan kaa samay barbaad kar rahe hai

 How the mesh is woven, and how each wire of that mesh is connected at the end
 shaayad bijoy nambiar is baat ko gaharaai tak samaj nahin paae or vah ek suspence thriller ko bahut hi obvious film bana baithe
 Perhaps it is also the lack of Bollywood directors that they want to make suspense thriller on the lines of Hollywood but are not able to keep their grip on the story and the characters
 nateezaah film kaa majaa kirkira ho jaataa he
 However, the producer of the film Vidhu Vinod Chopra said before the release of 'vazir' that he wanted to make this film in Hollywood
 film ko dekhakar to yahi lagata he ki shaayad yah behatar hi hota ki vah is film ko hollywood main hi banaate
 The story of the story is Farhan Akhtar ATS officer
 unki bivi he
 One day in an encounter with terrorists, he loses his most valuable thing
 vah pashchaatap kii aag main jeene lagate hai or unki bivi bhi us beshkeemtee nuksaan ke liye unhen hi doshi maanati he
 During this time, he meets Amitabh Bachchan, who is a Divyang
 vah shatranj ke jabardast khilaadi hai
 He is a victim of an accident and the pain of his life is also like Farhan
 phir ek samay aata he ki farhaan apni pareshaani ke saath amitabh kii pareshaani ko bhi hal karne main lagate hai
 Then many secrets are revealed and many things are revealed
 kahani kaa on-of hona bahut tang karata he
 The suspense thriller's soul seems to be missing, due to weak storylines and treatment, the film becomes lazy
 agar farhaan or amitabh ke role ek duusare se badal die jate to shaayad film main kuch aisa kiya ja saktaa tha jo soch se pare hota, shaayad film hollywood kaa test lekar aa sakati thi
 Star Appeal Amitabh Bachchan has done as good a job as he could in a wheelchair
 unhone ek shatranj khilaadi ke taur par apnekairactaramen jaan foonki he
 The film's usps are the same, and it is still enjoyable to watch them

 Bihar Yoga School has considered yoga as a discipline, science and lifestyle, saying that man can achieve perfection in his life through yoga, but also said about June 21 that this day is completely day and night

 kaha ja rahaa he ki kendra sarkaar metro parichaalan kii maujuuda vyavastha main badlaav se jude aise kisi vikalp par amal ke paksh main nahin he, jisase isaki kaaryadakshata prabhavit hoti ho
 In such a situation, the option of the Kejriwal government to issue 'pink Token' as a separate ticket to provide free travel facility to women in the Delhi Metro will be valid to the Central Government, it is unlikely

 unhone daleel di, ‘token pranali ko bhrashtachar or durupyog kii shikayaton ke kaaran band karne ke kaaran dilli metro main ab swachaalit tikat pranali lagu he
 For this reason, ticket vending machines are employed in most stations by closing 'token windows'

 ? apane saubhaahgya or vaadon kii sej par savaar bijepi ko vyaapman, sushamaa swaraj or shivaraj singh chouhan main sab kuch naitik or shuchitapurna lagata he, so, is naate ve hangaame ke labhaarthi hai
 For a decade, the Congress, which was wearing a sheet of silence over tainted ministers, is looking at the uproar with its erudite mps
 tippaniyan In this way everyone expects an uproar
 mayawati or saal main ekaadh din bolne vaale vampanthi bhi hangaame kii ummid se hi zindaa dikh rahe hai
 The BJP is happy that the questions like land acquisition are disappearing from the media due to the uproar, the questions that have arisen over the debate have easily saved their lives
 bijepi ke pravaktaa khaastaur par raahat kii saans le rahe hai ki kuch din to shanti se biit rahe hai
 Amit Shah is now 25 years old for the development of the country, and the Congress simply calls resignation-resignation in the morning and evening, so that its beats are heard in the screams of the first pages and channels of newspapers
 to, manzil sabaki bas ek, hangaamaa he! kisaanon ko saikadon ke check ab bhi bheje ja rahe hai, maharashtra main achche dinon kii 'dabl sarkaron' ke baad bhi aatmahatyaon kaa daur jari he
 The fear of riots and the news of the ruckus are drowning in the whirlpool of the uproar, so who will not be loved by the uproar
 dushyant ne bhale hi hangaamaa khadaa karne ko lekar negative atitute kaa izhaar kiya ho, lekin hamaari sari partiyaan hangaame ko lekar behad positive hai or hangaame kii ummid par zindaa hai
 In this, the BJP sees the formula of going through five years of peace and the Congress can remain immersed in the dream of a golden future by making enough noise with its remaining mps
 jo baaki bache, ve irshyaa se hangaame ko nihaar, sun-dekh or kos sakate hai
 Overall, the uproar's career is on the right track, so let the worry of the country go in its worship and be happy
 is tarah har kisi ko hangaame se ummid he
 Mayawati and the leftists who speak for a few days in the year are also looking forward to the expected uproar
 bijepi khush he ki hangaame ke kaaran jameen adhigrahan jaise sawaal media se gaayab ho rahe hai, un par bahason se khadey hone vaale sawaalon se aasaani se jaan batch gai he
 The BJP spokesperson is breathing a sigh of relief that some days are passing in peace
 amit shah ab desh ke vikaas ke liye 25 saal or congress subah-shaam or raat ko bas istipha-istipha kahati he, taaki akhabaaron ke pehle pannon or channelon kii cheekh-pukaar main uski dhadakanen sunai padati rahen
 So, everyone is just a ruckus! Hundreds of checks are still being sent to farmers, suicides continue even after the 'double governments' of good days in Maharashtra
 aae din dangon ke dar or bavaal kii khabaren hangaamon ke bhavar main dub rahi hai, to koun hoga, jise hangaame se mohabbat na ho
 Dushyant may have expressed negative attitude about creating a ruckus, but all our parties are very positive about the uproar and live up to the expectation of the uproar
 isamen bijepi ko paanch baras shanti se guzar jane kaa formula dikh rahaa he or congress apane bache-khuche saansadon ke saath paryaapt shor karke sunahare bhavishya ke swapn main dubi rah sakati he
 Those who are left can see, hear and curse the uproar with envy

Why was the North East ignored till date? Why till today there was no National War Memorial for the brave heroes of the army? Why till today there was no National Police Memorial for the brave mighty policemen? Till date why was the flag not hoisted in the Red Fort in memory of the government of Azad Hind Fauj? ”prime Minister Modi further said,“ You people (aaj Tak) call themselves ‘the fastest’
