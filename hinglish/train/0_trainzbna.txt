 madhyapradesh main udhyaniki fasalon ke jariye kisaanon kii aamadani badhaane kii disha main rajya sarkaar ne prayaas tej kar die hai

 On Saturday, Chief Minister Kamal Nath had a meeting with representatives of coca-cola Company and Jain Irrigation Company on the issue of planting of orange and mango plants
 is baithak main mukhyamantri ne kaha ki udhyaniki fasalon ko badhaava dekar kisaanon kii aay doguni kii ja sakegi
 For this it is necessary to identify such areas where horticultural crops can be promoted with the help of private sector

 PM Modi himself indicated this
 unhone anya pichhadaa varg (OBC) ke kota ke bheetar hi ati pichhadaa varg (MBC) ke liye aarakshan kota tay karne kii vakaalat kii he
 In a rally held on Sunday in Baghpat, he said that the government wants that this section of the backward caste, which has a large population but scattered, should get the benefit of the policy of reservation
 unhone kaha, 'sarkaar ne pichhadi jatiyon ke sab-categorijesh ke liye kamishan ke gathan kaa nirnay bhi kiya he
 The government wants that those who are very backward in the OBC community should get more benefit of the reservation within the government and educational institutions
 unhone kaha ki jo vaada modi ne kiya he vah use puraa hi karegaa
 It is worth noting that 27% reservation quota has been fixed for other backward classes in government jobs and educational institutions
 aisa mana jaataa he ki pichley saal bijepi ko upi main mili jabardast jeet main ati pichde varg ke matadaataaon kii badi bhoomika he

 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav aarope-pratyaropon se ghira hua he
 From ground level to social media, this time in electoral wrestling, leaders have been fighting with great vigor
 haalanki, in sab ke bich jo sabase mahatvapurn ladaai he, wo he pradhanmantri narendra modi-banaam rahul gandhi kii
 Modi and Rahul Gandhi left no stone unturned to beat each other on social media
 in sab ko maapne ke liye india today data intelligence unit ne twitor aankadon se yah jaanane kii koshish kii ki soshal media kii jang main aakhir baari koun he
 On March 10, 2019, from when the election dates were announced, from then till April 21, 2019, we analyzed the Twitter data of Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi
 chunki modi bataur pradhanmantri bhi kaaphi kuch twit karte rahete hai, isliye hamane unke sabhi aadhikarik twits ko apane vishleshan se baahar rakhaa or keval raajnneetik twits kaa hi aankalan kiya
 The number of tweets, when it comes to posting something on Twitter, Rahul Gandhi seems weaker than Narendra Modi
 in 42 dinon main ab tak pradhanmantri narendra modi 489 twits post kar chuke hai
 At the same time, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has tweeted only 72 during this period
 ausat kaa hisaab lagaaein to jahaan modi din main lagbhag gyaarah baar twit karte hai, vahin rahul gandhi din ke 2 twit tak kii ausat tak bhi nahin pahunch pate
 Modi is well ahead of Rahul in terms of retweet
 jahaan 489 twits par modi ko lagbhag 36 lakh ritvit hue, vahiin rahul gandhi ke 72 twit, 6
 Retired only 7 lakh times
 twitor par sakriyatavidiounki twitor par kairactor kii seemaa 280 hoti he isliye yuzar apane aap ko khulkar abhivyakt nahin kar pate
 Photos and videos serve to fill this gap
 is maamle main bhi rahul gandhi peeche rah gaye hai
 Of his 489 tweets, Modi posted 176 tweets (36 per cent) along with the video
 vahiin rahul gandhi ke 72 twits main se maatr 11 twits (15 pratishat) hi video ke saath post kiye gaye
 The number of videos in Modi's tweets is also high because he tweets the same thing over and over
 jab bhi modi kahin chunavi bhaashan dene pahunchate hai unka twitor unke bhaashan kaa live prasaaran karata he
 In addition, Modi re-tweets by cutting 2-3 clips from the same speech
 duusari ore rahul gandhi twitor par bahut kam hi live jate hai or unke zyaadaatar video baad main edit kar post kiye jate hai
 Language leaders: Both the leaders have kept regional languages in mind, but here too Modi has defeated Rahul Gandhi
 modi ne zyaada bhashaaon main twit to jarur kiye, lekin unki sankhya kam thi, vahi aankadon ke hisaab se rahul gandhi ne alag alag bhashaaon ke twit zyada kiye
 While Rahul Gandhi tweeted in 6 languages, Modi tweeted in 9 languages
 rahul gandhi ke 72 twits main se 71 pratishat angreji main thim, 24 pratishat hindi main or tamil, oriya, malayalam or marathi main 1 pratishat se kuch upar thim
 Modi confined most of his tweets to the English language
 unhone kshetreey bhashaaon main rahul gandhi se zyaada twit kiye, lekin jab unako pratishat main aanka gaya to unki sankhya kam thi
 Of Modi's 489 tweets, 83 per cent were in English, 13 per cent in Hindi, slightly more than 1 per cent in Telugu and Marathi and less than 1 per cent in Odia, Gujarati, Bangla, Tamil and Assamese languages
 logon se judaavye ek aisa kshetra he jahaan modi or rahul gandhi main akaash pataal kaa antar dekhne ko miltaa he
 Rahul Gandhi's Twitter keeps only his words, on the contrary Modi's tweets are seen connecting with people
 modi twitor par or logon se bhi sampark karte hai
 From tweeting the views of his fellow ministers, Modi also tweets top filmstars, actors and journalists to make people aware
 jab twitor par # mainbhichowkidaar trend kar rahaa tha, tab modi aam janata ko twitor par dhanyavad dete hue nazar aa rahe the
 Congress also tried to trend # chowkidaarhichorhai but Modi's Twitter handle did not show any strength in Rahul's Twitter handle
 unhone mushkil se hi kisi saathi congressi ke hawaale se kuch twit kiya or yahaan tak apni bahan priyanka gandhi ke twits tak ko retweet nahin kiya
 Rahul Gandhi does not appear to interact with the general public at all
 11 march ko isi saal narendra modi ne twitor par punjab ke mukhyamantri or congress party ke varisht netaa captain amarinder singh ko janmdin kii mubaarakabaad di, vahiin congress adhyaksh ne unako twitor par badhai nahin di
 Although Rahul Gandhi is also very popular on Twitter, based on all these facts, it would not be wrong to say that Rahul Gandhi has yet to go a long distance to leave as much impact as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has on social media

 aakhir ceiling ke liye koun doshi he or kya he iskaa samaadhaan
 Everyone is asking this question and whether there are still more screws in dda's proposal regarding sealing
 jahaan in sawaalon se har koi jujh rahaa he, aapako bataate hai ki kahaan he pench, kya he samaadhaan or koun he doshi
 Actually this thing starts from 2006, when there was a boil in Delhi regarding sealing
 jiske baad 2300 ke kareeb sadakon ko notiphoi kar raahat di gai thi
 Delhi's Master Plan 2021 was then implemented, in which merchants who had increased their shop size to 300 square meters, along with conversion charges, were also given relief in this master plan
 kya he maamlajis samay ye master plan lagu kiya gaya, us samay 1 lakh 6 xxrep 4 0 ke kareeb vyapaariyon ne registration karaayaa or us par lagane vaala kanvarjan charge diya
 Also, according to the master plan, the last date for giving charge was given on 30 June every year
 nahin dene par 10 guna jurmaane kaa praavdhaan kar diya gaya
 Those who violated the rules by increasing their shop from 120 square meters or a few meters to 300 square meters, were also exempted and it was said that those who built it were relieved, but no one else should be made further
 vahiin emsidi ko parking shulk lekar parking kii vyavastha karne ko kaha gaya
 The basement was allowed to create a professional office (ie doctor, CA or lawyer)
 hua kya or koun he doshiciling se raahat milte hi kuch vyapaariyon ne kanvarjan charge diya or kuch ne nahi
 In 2008, this number came down to around 36000 and the number of merchants paying conversion charges kept decreasing year after year
 zyaadaatar vyapari kanvarjan charge dena hi bhul gaye or difolter ho gaye
 At the same time, some traders neither gave conversion charge and on the other hand increased their shop from 120 square meters or few meters to 300 square meters
 iskaa matlab ye ki na to vyapaariyon ne kanvarjan charge diya, jo ki dena jaruri tha, vahiin kuch vyapaariyon ne niyamon kaa ulanghan kar apni dukaan kii sies badha di
 The MCD has neither charged the conversion charge nor shown any strictness about it
 saath hi saath parking kii vyavastha karnaa hi bhul gai
 During this time, many traders sold their shops, while others bought another shop
 yani jisane dukaan bechi yaa jisane dukaan kharidi in donon main se kisi ne kanvarjan charge nahin bharaa
 Its disadvantage is that whoever bought the shop in 2014 will have to pay the previous dues
 emsidi ne bhi parking kaa intazaam nahin kiya
 That means mcds as well as traders are to blame for this
 kya he iskaa samaadhansamadhaan yahi he ki master plan main kuch badlaav karen jisamen kanvarjan charge nahin dene vaale ke liye jo 10 guna jurmaane kaa praavdhaan he, usamen jurmaana 10 guna se ghataakar ek yaa do guna kar diya jaae, joki didie ne apane prastaav main kiya he
 At the same time, traders should be given relief in paying conversion charge, under which they are asked to pay the charge in 4 or 5 installments
 master plan main jo aria viz a se lekar e jo ketegory banaai gai, usamen a category main aane vaale dukaanon ko saal main 6000 rupee squaire meter ke hisaab se saal kaa kanvarjan charge dena he
 Meaning if a merchant's shop is in 120 square meters, then one year 6000 * 120 = that much money has to be paid
 e category vaale ko 1500 squaire meter ke hisaab se dena he, lekin ketegory ko lekar kanfusion he
 According to which the shop of Khan Market and Subhash Nagar cannot be one
 jisko phir se clear karne kii jarurat he
 If only these two are changed, then the problem of more than half of the traders will end there itself
 kahaan he penchajahan dilli parking kii samasya se jujh rahi he vahiin ab un vyapaariyon ko raahat dene kii baat ho rahi he jinhone niyamon kaa ulanghan kar apane dukaanon kii sies badha di
 Meaning those who were in 40 square meters, they increased it to 100 square meters, some increased from 100 to 200, some increased from 200 to 250
 yani jin vyapaariyon ne niyamon kaa ulanghan kar 2007 main raahat pai ab vahi samasya phir se he
 That is, after 10 years, preparations are being made to give exemption to the traders violating the rules, in which DDA proposed to increase the FAR but then the same parking
 matlab jin dukandaaron ne dukaanon kii sies badhaai he unhen FAR badhaane ke baad ground floor main parking deni hogi
 The problem starts from here because those who want to make new ones can make it, but those whose shop is already built, will they break the shop and make parking in the ground floor which is a big problem and this is the biggest screw
 doosraa ye he ki agar niyam ulanghan karne vaale vyapaariyon ko duusari baar raahat di gai to phir kya guarantee he ki koi or apni dukaan kii sies nahin badhayenge
 That is, the traders who got exemption in 2007 by violating the rules, now after ten years the government is ready to give the same exemption
 aise main sawaal he ki kahin to rukegaa ye maamla, jiske liye sarkaar, emsidi or vyapaaree teenon ko milakar thos nateeja nikalnaa padegaa, kyonki ye kahana galat nahi he ki vyapaaree or emsidi adhikariyon ne milakar niyamon ko todaa-maroda
 If this is not resolved today, then maybe the same situation will happen again after 10 years
 jahaan aaj he vahi aage bhi hoga or phir supreme court ko isamen dakhal dena padegaa or sarkaron ko ye bataanaa padegaa ki chhot ke naam par kya sarkaar dilli ko slam bananaa chaahati he

 So much so that the tongue of Moments like 'main Tum Hum' was shared on Facebook, a selfie photo that captures the cuteness, so wrote it in the caption
 rickvestaan paaiyaan ve
 Then put this song in the loop and heard it a lot
 suna to akharane laga
 There is a sing song
 nihaayat hi pongapathi
 Anti-feminist ab ise khabt kah sakate hai
 But it is
 aaie dekhen jaraa
 The heroine is a UK film director by profession
 shoot karne ke liye malaysia ai he
 Currently sitting in a cafe
 yani aaj kii nari he
 Financially self-supporting
 chunki maine film dekhi he, isliye yah bhi bataa detaa hum ki nayika swabhimani bhi he
 But then he gets something like love
 or tab uske bheetar kaa sara oj abhisar ke pher main bah jaataa he
 What is the destiny of a girl
 he piya, mere liye golden jhumake le aao
 i should kiss them and wear them in my ears
 he piya, mujhe shopping karwaao
 Show the movie with love love
 or ye sab tum kyon karo
 Because my art is white
 gori bhi nahin
 Further, the cry of the wrists in the next line is white
 or phir killer giraaya jaataa he
 i am your part
 hamen lagata he ki hot pants pahani hui nayika har myne main ek shashakt mahila hogi
 But this illusion breaks badly when she says, "request Pian Way
" ' shopping karaane ke liye vah purush par ashrith he or iske liye baqayada darkhwaast mod main he
 This is the post-modern form of dependence of woman on man
 arthath he purush
 This is the entire pasture that i wish for
 vah tere praarabdh kaa hissaa he
 But for that you have to go shopping for the heroine
 nayak bhi rap karte hue apane komal udgaar ugal hi detaa he
 He reveals his frustrated wish
 white kalaaiyaan drivs me kreji
 And then some lantarani
 nayika ab or bhi hulus jaati he
 It is not just shopping and filming
 ab use gulabi chunni bhi chahie
 And colorful bangles too
 kyon chahie
 As he wished
 vyaktigat taur par mujhe ladakiyon ko sirf gulabi rang se baandhne se aitraaj he
 There may be some historical reasons for the pink tint
 magar unki padtaal to ab hoti nahin
 It is assumed that if she is a girl by default, then she will like Pink
 yaa kahen ki karavaaya jayega
 Never go to buy a frock for a child
 munh se niklaa nahin ki ladki he or celsman maar pink pink aapako pakaa degaa
 But okay, here is the will of the heroine
 ki use gulabi chunni dilwaai jaae
 i object to not asking for color
 nayika padhe
 Do the job apane paise se jamkar shopping kare
 Sang maine gulabi chunni le lee
 Took a colorful bangle
 khub sari shopping kar lee
 And then say
 e ladke
 Will you go to see the film with me? matlab do dhai dashak main ham itnaa to aage aa hi gaye hai na soch, samaj or jamini maamle main
 With a lot of hard work
 chittiyaan kalaaiyaan sunate hi gori he kalaaiyaan yaad aata he
 Arjun's song in the film Aaj Ka
 yahaan bhi nayika gaanv ke seoup main nayak ko lubhaa rahi he
 She is saying that she is white, you give me green bangles
 apana bana luun tuje baalama
 You can say that the nineties were not tied at all then
 nayika khet main khaanaa le jaati thi
 Used to handle the house
 magar fasal bechney marad hi jaataa tha
 His parts were children, rags and jewelry
 cash nahin
 So he used to say bring me bangles
 or tab hero ke paas gift ke aise vikalp bhi nahin the ki dekh main tuje kitta pyaar karata hum
 The entire two GB netpack was put in your phone
 baat chuudi kii nahin he
 Here the protagonist talks about something concrete
 sabase pehle to gorepan kii mahanata kaa nishedh karata hua kahata he ki gori ho kalai
 Whether it is black wrist
 jo bhi chuudi pahanaae funs jaae
 Meaning the hero is something progressive
 khalariya ke color par nahin atakta
 Perhaps Fair and Lovely had not yet seen a market in the village
 yaa phir thok ke bhav emb padhakar nikle launde kolgate or lifeboy ke bazaar main send lagane ke liye pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana kii phisalpattee par savaar ho is nae anduhe swarg main nahin utre the
 But why does the protagonist Nalayak talk about getting trapped
 uskaa matlab kya he ji
 That man gets trapped in the beauty of a woman
 jaise na fanse to mangal par kamandal lekar chadh jaae ek saans main
 But wait, the discussion is after this
 gane main chuudi ke baad nayak arth kii yani asal mudde kii baat karata he
 He says that greenery should not be cultivated, but the cultivation of Bhima should be green
 to matlab pehle khet kii, kharid kii chintaa
 Then all these raita should be spread
 ab nayaa jamaana he
 Why does the heroine flirt with the hero for the bangle
 zyaadaatar nayak vaise bhi khet chhod aae hai
 Now they do not sweat in the worry of harvesting wheat in the month of Jeth
 aisi kamaron main computer ke saamne gulaami karte hai
 Then, during the break, eat a burger made of the same refined avatar made of wheat, and just walk out for a minute
 us thande nirvaat se
 And say
 its so hot
 The heroine is no longer the cherry of men
 usne ghaghara utaar hot pant chadha liye hai
 As he wished
 jo kapade pahane
 But Akhar Gaya swore to ask for Chijju from Yun Nayak
 ye lofadai or pralobhan vaala kaam to nabbe kaa salmaan karata tha
 When he used to sing
 chalati he kya nau se baarah
 He does not pretend to be gentle
 saaf kar detaa he ki sho raat kaa he, tikaten do hai or chipak kar baithunga main
 We see this turning poetry into prose in the film Gangs of Wasseypur
 nayak don ban gaya he
 But there is only a chimney to see
 nayika maadhuri kaa kasbaai varjan he
 Seeing my bharo, i swear after seeing my bharo
 nayak nabbe fisadi mardon kii tarah gided hit sencing missile sa bana hua he
 Distraught to see cleavage
 or tab nayika puuchhati he kitaab kii dukaan ke baar romance karte hue
 Before going to see Karan Arjun
 satakar baithoge, god main popcorn dhundhonge
 The protagonist says neither for fear of robbery
 or tab nayika kahati he ki jab ye sab nahin karnaa to apni ammaa ke saath hi dekho na jaakar
 Anyway nayika badal rahi thi ye to mujh nayak ko pataa tha
 The songs also gave its credibility late in the morning
 yaad karen
 That scene from the Lakshya film
 nayak sidhe sidhe kah detaa he ki ham saath hai or hamen saath hona chahie
 The heroine gets angry
 are, aise kaise sidhe facch se munh par de maaraa
 Say to adaa or ye sunate hi nayak chibillaa matakne fatakane lagata he
 If i say i love you nayika is bhole bhandari ko samajhaati he ki is baat ko or sajaa ke kehete, ghuma phiraake kehete to acha hota
 
 
 But as the decade passes, the heroine begins to bore this style
 ab use sidhi baat vaala ladkaa chahie
 Ye tu phool main bhanpara type metaphor shop stall do not decorate him
 to nayak jab pichley sabak ke vasheebhoot purakhon ko pranaam karte hue ghumaakar ishk kaa izhaar karata he to nayika dapat detii he
 Decides to come straight to the point
 kasam se, us vakt shamsher bahadur kii kavita ‘tuuti hui bikhri hui’ kii wo line yaad aa jaati he
 There is great love in his injections

 He is a player who always works with patience

 He said, 'he keeps telling me that as a cricketer, i will keep improving as long as i stay within this range
 ’yah poochne par ki kya up captaini ne unhen adhik jaagruk kar diya he, kohli ne kaha, ‘jab main up captain bana to mere aasapaas ke logon ne mujhase kaha ki mujhe apni aakraamakata ke badlaav laane kii jarurat he
 Because people now have more eyes on me and i have to change my aggressive attitude

 pradhyumna hatyakand main mukadmaa darj karne ke baad sibiai kii team gudgaanv ke reyaan international skool tafteesh karne ja pahunchi
 The CBI team consists of three officers, who are investigating the school
 isi dauraan pradhyumna ke pita ne CBI jaanch shuru hone par santosh jataayaa he
 During this time, the three accused in the case have been sent on CBI remand
 pradhyumna murder cese ke teenon aropiyon ko court ne sibiai kii apil par ek din ke liye remand par de diya
 These three accused were arrested by the Gurgaon police in connection with this sensational murder
 ab sibiai kii team in aropiyon se poochtacha karegi
 After the CBI investigation began, Pradyuman's father Varun Thakur said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak / India Today that he was satisfied
 ab is maamle kii jaanchasibiaine shuru kar di he
 He is confident that the CBI will go to the bottom of the case in this case and present a correct report
 pradhyumna ke pita varun kaa kahana he ki ab sibiai ko chahie ki is maamle main reyaan international skool ke top management ke khilaaf bhi karrwai karen taaki ainda is tarah kii ghatnaayen kisi bhi skool main naa ho
 Other people also got lessons from this action
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle sibiai team ne shuukravaar kii shaam gudgaanv police headquater pahunchakar haryana police se is cese kaa charge liya tha
 Due to media pressure and the efforts of Pradyuman's father, the case has been handed over to the CBI
 reyaan international skool main maasoom pradhyumna kii galaa retkar hatya kisne or kyon kii, yah sawaal abhi bhi logon ke man main jas kaa tas bana hua he
 Earlier, when Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar went to the residence of Pradyapuram Thakur and announced that now the investigation of the case is being handed over to the CBI, the family members are hoping that now they will get the answer
 vahiin, haryana police daawa kar rahi he ki vah maamle kii tah tak pahunch chuki he or chargeshit lagbhag banakar taiyaar he
 But the disclosure of any case does not just mean that the police should put a man in front of someone who is committing a crime
 tahakikat kaa matlab hota he ki us maamle se jude saare sawaalon ke santoshjanak jawaab police ke saamne hon
 It is worth noting that on September 8, innocent Pradyuman was brutally murdered at Rayan International School in Gurgaon
 iske baad haryana sarkaar ne gudgaanv kaa reyaan international skool teen maah ke liye apane adheen kar liya he

 com / 4gdwsndnvq There was chaos in Samasabad Pillow village of Azhargarh police station area of azamgarh when the children went out to eat food at the village market to celebrate the happiness of Bakrid
 hua yun ki zyaadaatar logon ne chaat kii dukaan se chaat khai iske baad kuch logon kii haalat kharaab hone lagi
 As soon as the condition of 37 people in the village deteriorated and the atmosphere of the village festival became turbid
 jab biimaar logon ko najadik ke swasth centre par le jaaya gaya to vahaan koi doctor nahin mila
 After this, patients had to undergo treatment at Phulpur Primary Health Center, ten kilometers away
 is baat ko lekar bhi logon main rosh tha
 a total of 37 people have been ill in this case so far
 jisamen auraten bachche or vyask bhi hai
 In this case, the police has registered an FIR against the lick and arrested him
 esadm sadar ne bataaya, ‘ahraula block ke samasabad main chaat khaane se 29 bachche biimaar ho gaye
 He is brought here for treatment
 inaki ab haalat thik he or us chaat vaale ko giraftaar kar uske khilaaf mukadmaa darj kar diya gaya he
 ' agar aandhi-tufaan or usamen hui mauton ko chhod diya jaae to ujjain sinhasth main sabase zyada charchit do chijen raheen—bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa dalit sadhu-santon ke saath samarasata snaan or sangh kii saraparasti main hua teen divasiy antarrashtriya vichaar mahakumbh
 It created such a combination of religion and politics that even the opponents appeared to be worried
 bhagava kheme ne chaturaai ke saath ranneeti ko paravaan chadha liya
 As such, it was called the ideological intellectual conference in which various topics like education, health, agriculture, women empowerment, values of life, science and religion were discussed
 lekin bhagava parivaar kii ranneeti in sabhi upakramon ke jariye samaaj ke sabase nichle tabake par focus kar apana saamaajik aadhaar badhaane kii he
 Therefore, Shivraj Singh Chauhan government of Madhya Pradesh organized this idea Kumbh under the direct supervision of the union
 aayojan kii patakatha kareeb dedh saal pehle hi likhi ja chuki thi, jab bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh ke masale par modi sarkaar kii chhavi pro-korporate banane lagi thi
 The campaign gained momentum when Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha on 20 April 2015, lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the 'suit-boot ki sarkar'
 uske baad sangh-bijepi main alag-alag formon par charchaa kar sinhasth main vichaar mahakumbh kaa khaakaa buna gaya
 According to sources, it is the founder of bjp's predecessor, Jana Sangh Pt
 dinadayal upaadhyaay ke janm shatabdi varsh samaaroh aayojanon kaa hissaa tha
 The strategy of the Sangh is, after all, is there a strategy to do such activities in other states also
 lekin is vichaar manthan se nikle sandesh ko bijepi rajyavar lagu karne kii disha main bad rahi he
 BJP MP Anil Madhav Dave, convener of the Vichar Mahakumbh, says, "what is the right way to live, this was the universal message of the event, now the Madhya Pradesh government or other governments will do what they can
" '' yani bauddhik samagam ke agenda ko khaas taur se bijepi shasit rajyon main paravaan chadhaane kii ruparekha ninaura gaanv se nikal padi he
 a senior BJP leader says, "pt
 nehru ko haal hi main rajasthan kii bijepi sarkaar kii ore se paathyakram se hataane kaa vivaad usee agenda kaa hissaa he jo vaajapeyi sarkaar ke samay bhagavakaran ke aaropon kii vajah se kamjor pad gaya tha
 But now there is no compulsion of alliance, so the Sangh's thinking is to add Indian mystics, deities and spirituality in NCERT courses
 '' haalanki sangh yah maanata he ki is tarah kaa badlaav ek din main nahin ho saktaa, isliye vichaar kumbh jaise bade aayojanon kii shrunkhlaa ke jariye hi vaataavaran banaaya ja saktaa he
 In the inauguration of the Mahakumbh, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat also indicated, "let us create an environment to bring change in society
" aaj vaataavaran bana he, lekin hamen us disha main kaam karne kii jarurat he
 BJP general secretary Ram Madhav also addressed a session on 'ideological vision and society'
 bhagava parivaar kii ranneeti samaaj ke nichle tabake main paith banaakar vaicharik-rajnatik aadhaar ko badhaane kii he, taaki sangh teen peedhishon se jis samaaj ko sangathit karne kii soch banaakar chal rahaa he, use apane hisaab se saakaar kar sake
 This is the reason why Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi of the Sangh was present in the churning for three days
 dalit snaan par vivadakabir ne kaha he, jaat na pucho sadhu kii
 Politics is the opposite
 ranneeti ke tahat sinhasth main 11 may ko dalit sadhu-santon ke saath snaan kaa kaarykram rakhaa gaya, jisamen bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah shaamil hue
 At first it was called Shabari Snan, later the social harmony bath was coined
 sadhu-santon ne iskaa purajor virodh kiya to ant main 'sant snaan' ho gaya
 Although Dave describes it as a byproduct of the media, "where are all the things in the river, then where does the harmony come from?" Have to break into the bank
 is vot bank par najar gadaaye baithi bijepi ne to buddha bhikshu dow
 The Dhamma Chetna Yatra has also started under the leadership of Dhamma Vireo Mahathero
 isamen 60-70 buddha bhikshuon kaa jattha buddha viharon main jaakar bijepi ke paksh main maahaul bana rahaa he
 The visit is fully monitored by BJP national general secretary Arun Singh, who makes daily reports
 haalanki ve is abhiyaan ko sinhasth ke dalit snaan se nahin jodate, lekin unke shabd suniye, ''pradhanmantri babasahab ambedkar kii janmasthali mau gaye, lekin mayawati aaj tak vahaan nahin gayi
 The work done by Ambedkar in the name of Ambedkar has not been done till date
 '' bijepi kii daleel he ki modi agar dalit sadhu yaa dalit, pichde samudaay kii baat karte hai, to uskaa matlab garibi or garib se hi hota he
 Modi needs Indira Wali Poverty, a senior leader of the BJP says that under this strategy, the Modi government took a step towards changing the image of the suit-boot government
 aam bajet ko gaanv-garib kendrit karne ke baad bijepi ne saamaajik sameekaran ke hisaab se ranneeti banane par jor diya
 In fact, the BJP and PM Modi's strategy behind this is to achieve the same tag of being pro-poor, which was once associated with former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai, ''indira ne 'garibi hataao' jaise naare ke saath garib shabd ko apane saath chipka liya tha
 But now there is an emptiness and Sonia gandhi-rahul Gandhi have failed to associate themselves with that image
 usee khalipan ko bharne ke liye garib shabd ko modi apane naam ke saath jodna chaahate hai
 "this BJP leader argues that there should be a general budget or a discussion on the constitution in Parliament
 ambedkar kaa kad badhanaa, unase judi jagahon ke vikaas kaa kaam haath main lenaa, haal hi main paanch pradesh adhyakshon kii niyukti main kisi savarna ko tavajjo na dekar dalit-adivasee-pichhadaa card khelnaa usee ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 The party says that the government's plans too - stand up India, mandating loans to Dalit women in Mudra Bank, Rs 12 through PM Jeevan Suraksha Yojana
 kii skim or ujjwala yojana bhi garibon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaai gai hai
 Budget provision for Dalit entrepreneurs is also part of the same strategy
 jaahir he ki ninaura vichaar mahakumbh or dalit snaan sinhasth ko vivaadaaspad bhi bana gaya
 But the saffron brigade believes that through this, it has taken a step forward in realizing the thinking in which the people belonging to the lower classes should be linked with development and at the ideological and political level also with the sangh-bjp

 Amitabh's letter, in his voice: sibiai ke antarim nideshak em
 Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the appointment of Nageswara Rao
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii adhyakshata vaali ucchadhikaar praapt chayan samiti (salect cameti) ne alok verma ko sibiai nideshak ke pad se hataa diya tha
 Nageshwar Rao was then re-commanded by the top investigating agency
 bataa den, oktober 2018 main sibiai main vivaad ke baad sarkaar ne nideshak alok verma or vishesh nideshak rakesh asthana ko jabaran chuttee par bhej diya tha
 Nageshwar Rao was then made interim director
 sarkaar ke is faisle ke khilaaf alok verma court pahunch gaye the
 On 8 January, the Supreme Court reinstated Verma to the post of Director, saying that the government cannot remove the CBI Director, only the Select Committee
 iske baad pradhanmantri narendra modi kii adhyakshata vaali teen sadasyeey chayan samiti, jisamen loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa mallikarjun khadge or mukhya nyaayadhish ke pratinidhi ke rup main supreme court ke nyaayadhish justise eke sikri the, ne 2-1 ke bahumat se alok verma ko pad se hataa diya tha
 The government has not yet appointed a new director, so Nageswara Rao will remain the interim director
 yani ki lagbhag 3 hafte tak vah is pad par bane rah sakate hai, lekin prashanth bhushan ko is faisle se aapatti he, to unhone supreme court main yachika daayar kii he
 The court had rejected the Asthana case, before Prashant Bhushan had also appealed in the Supreme Court against the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Special Director, but the petition was dismissed
 iske baad unhone punarvichaar yachika daayar kii, par ise bhi nyaayalay ne khaarij kar diya
 He then filed a curative petition, but in December 2018, the court dismissed this petition and reprimanded Prashant Bhushan

 # sudharjaaowarnasudhaardenge — Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) February 14, 2019 aazaadee kii varshganth par is saal dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki rajdhani kii mahilaon ke liye 29 aktubar se ditisi or cluster bason main safar muft hoga
 After Deepawali, this announcement started on the day of Bhaijudaj
 ye apane aap main duniya kaa pehla tajurba kaha ja saktaa he jahaan itane bade varg ko muft safar karaayaa ja rahaa he
 However, the leaders of opposition parties are calling it Kejriwal's election announcement
 is par aam aadmi party (aap) kaa kahana he ki achche kaam karne vaali sarkaar ko janata dobaaraa chunati he
 The arguments made by the Delhi government to introduce this facility are different from politics
 dilli sarkaar ke think tanks maane jane vaale or rajdhani main parivahan sudhaaron par kaam kar rahe dialog and deveopment kamishan of india ke upaadhyaksh jasmin shah kehete hai, ''rajdhani kii bason main 44 lakh log roj safar karte hai or inamen kareeb 30 fisad hi mahilaayein hai
 The purpose of free travel in buses is to empower women and bring them on par
 ''sarkaar ne is ghoshnaa se pehle ek survey kiya tha jisamen pataa chalaa ki mahilaayein duuri or asuraksha kii vajah se rojgaar ke avasaron kaa laabh nahin uthaati hai
 Efforts have been made to resolve both issues by traveling freely in buses and by deploying marshals in every bus
 shah kehete hai, ''bharat main kul kamgaaron main mahilaon kii bhagidaari kareeb 24 fisad he
 Women's participation in Delhi's workforce is 11 percent
 lekin anya viksit yaa vikasshil deshon main yah ausat kareeb 48 fisad he
 It is necessary to increase it in Delhi
 ''baharhaal, pehle din kareeb 4
 77 women availed free bus service
 dilli main 5,600 basen chal rahi hai or kareeb 13 lakh mahilaayein roj yatra karti hai
 350 crore annually on free bus travel
 kharch karegi
 10 for every journey
 ditisi ko die jaaenge
 Free travel buses include AC, non-ac, cluster buses, airport going buses, all
 itnaa hi nahin noida-gudgaanv yaa rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main jahaan bhi ye basen ja rahi hai, vahaan kii mahilaon ko tikat nahin lenaa padegaa
 The idea is being given in the Delhi government to give free bus travel to the elderly and students
 dilli sarkaar kaa daawa he ki uske ab tak ke kadamon se mahilaon ko sabase zyada phayda hua he
 Mohalla clinics are more commonly used by women as families tend to avoid spending on women's health
 dilli sarkaar ne pehali baar jab muft bas yatra kii ghoshnaa kii thi to usamen metro ko bhi mahilaon ke liye muft karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 To this, party spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj says, "the Delhi government has sent the proposal to the metro and the central government
" centre ne prastaav kaa takneekee khaakaa taiyaar karne ke liye chah se aath maheene maange the
 Time has passed jaise hi centre kii hari jhandi milegi dilli sarkaar muft safar kii bharpai ke liye 12 sau karod ru
 Will give '' vaise, agar centre hari jhandi detaa he to isse metro ko hi phayda hoga kyonki zyada mahilaon ke safar karne se uski kamai badhegi
 a few months before the assembly elections, the Congress and BJP are calling the beginning of the free march politics
 lekin mukhyamantri kejariwal kaa kahana he, ''janata is faislese khush he
 If the public is happy then seats will come
 ''bharadwaj bhi maanate hai ki acha kaam karne vaali sarkaar ko janata dobaaraa chunati he
 However, the BJP did not lag behind in the announcement
 kuch dinon pehle centre kii endie sarkaar ne dilli kii avaidh coloniyon ko niyamit karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Whose political result will be more profound in these two announcements? In response to this, political analyst Abhay Kumar Dubey says, "the benefit of free bus travel was immediate, so the public's immediate response will be seen
" baharhaal, siyaasi ladaai main agar janata ko phayda mili to aisi ghoshnaaon kaa swaagat he

 The state of the Congress, which has been out of power in Bihar, has become like a tea-biscuit, which can break anytime
 bihar main congress ke 27 vidhayak hai, lekin yahaan halaat aise hai ki unki koi bhoomika nahin rah gai he or majabuuran argedy ke saath hi rahanaa pad rahaa he
 If sources are to be believed, many Congress leaders of the state are bored with this alliance with RJD and around 9 mlas are in touch with JDU
 haalanki is congress netaa is tarah kii khabaron kii khandan karte he
 a party leader says on the condition of anonymity, even though RJD supremo is seen in Bihar through the mirror of corruption and familyism, but did not ignore his role in bringing secular forces on a national level
 Can go loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar rashtriya str par kisi mahagathjod kii kavayad hoti he, vah lalu ke bina sambhav nahin
 For this reason, the Congress high command does not think of any political equation keeping the RJD separate
 argedy or congress ke bich sambandh kaaphi puraane he, jo 1997 main seetaram kesari ke congress adhyaksh rahete hue shuru hui thi
 After this, Sonia Gandhi became Congress President in the year 1998 and during this time she got full support of Laloo Prasad Yadav
 vahiin chaara ghotaale main fanse lalu kii sarkaar jab sankat main ghiri, congress ne hi samarthan dekar use ubaara
 However, after the break-up of the Grand Alliance with JDU and RJD in Bihar, the Congress in Bihar seems to be in a state of chaos
 uske netaa-vidhayak hataash hai or unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa ki aage kaa rasta kya hoga
 With RJD facing corruption charges, how will he overcome his destiny? congress netaaon kii sabase zyada naaraazgi party alaakaman kii chuppi ko lekar he
 Most local Congress leaders believe that in the case of Tejashwi Yadav, if the high command had decided to stay with Kumar, this day would not have been seen
 bihar kii satta se haath dhone ke baad inhen shikayaton kii vajah se congress netaa ab vikalp kii talash main jute gaye hai
 There are 27 Congress mlas in the state, so if the experts are to be believed, if the party breaks up in the coming days, one should not be surprised

 html In 2005, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) first attempted to regulate the surrogacy (rental womb) case
 isane bharat main assisted riproductive technology (ART) se judi medical sevaaon ko manyata, nig rani or niyaman ke liye ek neshnal guideline kaa draft taiyaar kiya tha
 Under the ART, infertility options are created through IVF (artificially fertilized) and the use of a rented womb for fetal development
 is koshish ke chalate 2008 main ART bill saamne aayaa
 It was also introduced in Parliament in 2010 and 2014 but could not pass
 2009 main kanoon ayog ne iskaa sangyaan liya or ART medical sevaaon ke regulation kii jarurat bataate hue sarogesi main shaamil donon pakshon ke adhikaar or daayitv par jor diya
 The commission only spoke of allowing surrogacy for 'philanthropy' and recommended that commercial surrogacy be banned, which was included in the 2016 surrogacy bill
 swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan maamle kii sansadeey samiti ne is bill kii samiksha kii
 In 2017, the committee suggested in its report that the first ART bill should be brought because there is no separate surrogacy clinic service
 aamtaur par ART clinics ke tahat sarogesi kaa vikalp diya jaataa he
 The committee concluded that 'there is a demand for time that legislation should be made by taking ART clinics'
 samiti ne yah bhi dhyaan dilaayaa ki 2014 ke ART bill main isse jude sabhi pahalu shaamil hai
 However, the government ignored this advice
 2016 kaa sarogesi bill 2019 main sansad main phir se pesh kiya gaya or loksabhaa se yah jaldbaaji main paas bhi ho gaya he
 Now the Rajya Sabha has decided to refer it to the same parliamentary committee
 bill main kya he?vidheyak main rashtriya str par ek sarogesi board kaa prastaav he
 Similarly, there will be surrogacy boards at the state and UT levels
 sarogesi kii prakriya or kaary pranali ke niyaman ke liye adhikariyon kii niyukti kii jaaegi
 The law also prohibits the purchase or sale of human embryos for commercial surrogacy or surrogacy
 isamen kisi bhi rup main sarogesi seva dene vaale sarogesi clinics ke liye registration anivaary kiya gaya he
 For violation of the provisions of the bill, there is a provision of at least ten years in jail and a fine of Rs 10 lakh
 yah vidheyak vivaahit bhartiya jodon ke liye sirf 'naitik paropkaaree sarogesi' kii anumati detaa he
 For this, the age of a woman should be between 23-50 and the age of a man 26-55
 iske alaava, jode ko vaidhanik rup se shaadi kiye hue kam se kam paanch saal biit chuke hon
 The definition of 'philanthropic surrogacy' states that apart from medical expenses and insurance cover of surrogate mother it should be without any expense, without money or fees
 vidheyak yah bhi kahata he ki saroget madar ko labhaarthi kii kareebi rishtedaar honi chahie, vah bhi aisi mahila 'jisaki shaadi ho chuki ho or uskaa apana baccha ho' or uski umr 25-35 saal kii honi chahie
 Any woman can become a surrogate mother only once
 is tarah ke garbh ko tabhi hataaya ja saktaa he jab saroget madar kii likhit main anumati ho or uchit praadhikari kii bhi anumati ho
 The bill also provides for preventing the abandonment of a child born of surrogacy and ensures all the rights that a biological son has
 kyon laayaa gaya bill?vidheyak kahata he ki kanoon ke bagaiyr sarogesi ek aniyantrit commercial pesha jaisaa ban jayega, aniatik kaary honge, saroget maanon kaa shoshan hoga, sarogesi se paidaa bacchon ko chhod diya jayega or sarogesi ke liye maanav bhrun or andanu yaa shukranuon kii kharid bikri bhi ho sakati he
 The proposal has been brought on the recommendation of the Law Commission which protects the rights of surrogate mothers and children
 sansadeey samiti kii ansuni chintaaen2017 main sansadeey samiti ne kaha tha ki pehle ART clinics kaa niyaman kiya janaa kiya janaa chahie, is niyaman kii chintaaon se alag, samiti ne kai mahatvapurn badlaav kii sifarish kii thi
 Which has been ignored in the 2019 bill
 isliye bill ko phir se usee panel ke paas bhejne kii kya jarurat hui, yah samaj se pare he
 The parliamentary committee recommended that 'close relatives', 'infertility' should be defined in this bill
 sirf 'paropkaaree sarogesi' kaa praavdhaan hataanaa chahie
 This provision should also be removed in case of an accused proving himself innocent
 mahila ke aborshan ke liye likhit anumati kaa praavdhaan nahin hona chahie
 The committee objected to restricting surrogacy to 'close relatives' and making it 'altruistic', stating that social, legal, emotional and morality would force women to be coerced and exploited due to family pressure
 samiti ne kaha ki sarogesi ko 'kareebi rishtedaar' (jise paribhaashit nahin kiya gaya he) tak simit karne se na keval mahilaon kii uplabdhta kam ho jaaegi, balki iskaa saroget mahila kaa shoshan rokane se bhi koi sambandh nahin he
 Therefore, it should be allowed in both the cases whether the female beneficiary is a relative or not
 samiti ne us praavdhaan par bhi sawaal uthaaya ki jisamen kaha gaya he ki shaadi ko paanch saal ho gaye hon or baccha na hua ho tabhi sarogesi kaa sahaara liya ja saktaa he
 Whereas the World Health Organization and the 2014 ART bill put this time of just one year
 is tarah ke pratibandh kisi kii maa banane kii sambhaavnaaon ko kam karenge, kyonki aajkal log vaise bhi der se shaadiyaan karte hai
 It also violates people's right to reproduction
 samiti kaa suzav tha ki ek saal kaa praavdhaan ho or baaki medical vajahon par chhod diya jaae
 The committee had also objected to the condition of the certificate of being legally married and infertile
 praaanpatr kii shart ko anaavashyak bataate hue samiti ne kaha tha ki ise shaadishuda jodon tak simit kar dene par vidhwaaon, talakshuda auraton, liv in jodon ke parents banane par pratibandh lag jayega
 It is not fair to associate the stigma of being infertile with a woman
 sansadeey samiti ne yah bhi jaananaa chaha tha ki saroget maa ko muaavje se vanchit kar dene ke peeche koun sa tark he, jo nau maheene or uske baad bhi kuch samay tak ksht se gujaregi, jabaki is prakriya main shaamil doctoron, aspataalon or vakeelon ko bhugtan kiya jayega
 In addition, the committee also suggested that poor women should be allowed surrogacy to meet their family needs
 panel kii kuch or siforishein thim jinhen nazarandaaj kiya gaya: sarogesi kii paribhaasha sateek honi chahie, spasht or varnanaatmak praavdhaan hon taaki galat vyakhya ke liye koi gunjaaish nahin ho or andanu yaa shu kranu daan karne par pratibandh hate, garbhpaat ke liye samay seemaa nirdhaarit kiye bina likhit anumati kaa praavdhaan hataaya jaae, kyonki iske peeche kaa tark spasht nahin he or garbhpaat ke bare main 1971 kaa prignancy act pehle se maujuud he jo suraksha dene ke saath distric medical board ko faisla lene kaa adhikaar bhi detaa he
 Dr
 Sharada Jain, a renowned gynecology-ivf specialist who has studied at the PGI of Raichandigarh and Lady Hording of Delhi and joined the Indian Medical Association, calls this bill a good step
 ve commercial sarogesi ko khatm karne or 'single parents' ke liye ise pratibandhit karne kaa swaagat karti hai
 He says that 90 percent of the people who come to India for commercial surrogacy from abroad are from the gay community, not people for whom surrogacy has any meaning
 haalanki, ve sansadeey samiti kii us sifarish se sahamat hai ki pehle ART bill aana chahie or 'kareebi rishtedaar' kii paribhaasha spasht honi chahie

 Rahul was removed from the middle of the current Ranji Trophy match against Rajasthan after the Indian batting collapsed in the second innings during the first Test in Rajkot
 rahul ke pehali pasand banane ke baad aisa lagata he ki senior salaami ballebaaj gambhir kaa kariyar lagbhag khatm ho gaya he jo do saal se adhik samay baad test cricket main vaapasi kar rahe hai
 Kohli said on the eve of the second Test, 'it is very clear in our mind that Lokesh Rahul is our first choice with Murali Vijay
 vah kabhi bhi feet ho saktaa he, vah team main vaapasi kar rahaa he or ham uske saath shuruuaat karenge
 Whether for that he has to be removed from the middle of the first class match
 yah niyamon ke anusaar he
 "he said," We hope to recover from him as soon as possible
 team kaa sangyojan isi tarah banataa he, aap us faisle ke saath jate hai jise team ke liye sarvshereshth samajhate hai
 i don't think we needed to think in a different way to get Rahul back
 ham khush hai ki vah ek baar phir team main shaamil he
 Comments rahul kii gairmaujuudagi main gambhir ne do test khele
 He played innings of 29 and 50 against New Zealand while 20 and zero against England
 kohli ne kaha ki gambhir alag-alag halaat main kaaphi acha khele
 Since Murali Vijay was successful in scoring a century in the first innings of the first test
 aise main is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki vishakhapatanam test main vijay ke saath rahul hi bhartiya pari kii shuruyaat karenge
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) After Rahul's first choice, it seems that the career of senior opener Gambhir is almost over, who is returning to Test cricket after more than two years
 kohli ne duusare test kii purv sandhya par kaha, ‘hamaare dimag main yah bilkul saaf he ki murali vijay ke saath lokesh rahul hamaari pehali pasand he
 He can be fit anytime, he is returning to the team and we will start with him

 This is how team composition is made, you go with the decision that you think is best for the team
 mujhe nahin lagata ki rahul ko waapas bulaane ke liye hamen kuch alag tareeke se sochane kii jarurat thi
 We are happy that he is once again in the team
 ’tippaniyan Gambhir played two Tests in the absence of Rahul
 unhone newjiland ke khilaaf 29 or 50 jabaki england ke khilaaf 20 or shunya ran kii paariyaan kheli
 Kohli said that Gambhir played very well under different circumstances
 chunki murali vijay pehle test kii pehali pari main shatak banane main safal rahe the
 In such a situation, there is a possibility that Rahul will start the Indian innings with victory in Visakhapatnam Test

 Now take the Leader of the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj
 unhone kaha ki ham shaheedon ke bare main puch kar deshbhakti kar rahe hai
 At the same time, the Congress has accused the BJP of doing politics on corpses and at the same time, with the help of statistics, it has declared itself better than NDA on the issue of security
 jab poonch main paak hamale main shahid hue javaanon kaa shav buudhvaar shaam ko dilli laayaa gaya
 At the same time, Sushma Swaraj tweeted
 unhone kaha, 'congress ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki laashon par raajnneeti ho rahi he
 But sorry, these dead bodies are not martyrs, and asking about martyrs is patriotic and not politics
 'isse pehle, congress pravaktaa pisi chaako ne bijepi par antni ke bayaan ko lekar raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 PC Chacko said, this is the first time the opposition is using the defense minister's statement as a political weapon

 In the last three weeks, there has been a flood of news and thoughts about Kashmir in the Indian media, but the thoughts and feelings of Kashmiris have got very little space in it
 vastav main, unke munh par bahut kasakar jaab baandh diya gaya he
 On August 5, 2019, when Article 370 of the Indian Constitution was repealed, all means of communication in Kashmir were suspended
 puri ghati main karfu jaise halaat paidaa kar die gaye, logon kaa gharon se baahar nikalnaa mushkil bana diya gaya
 Kashmir became like a dungeon for many days
 vahaan ke halaat ko khud dekhne-samajhane or logon ke vichaaron ko sunne ke liye ham chaar log (kavita krishnan, mamuna mullah, vimalbhai or main) 9 agast ko kashmir ke liye ravaanaa hue
 We stayed there for five days
 hamane pehle do din srinagar main bitaye
 We roamed around the city, talking to the residents there
 phir hamane ek car kiraye par lee or sopor, bandipora, pampor, pulavama, anantnag, bijabehaara or raste main padane vaale kai gaanvon kii yatra kii
 Often we crossed the checkposts kindly
 haalanki, ek yaa do baar hamen chakkar lagaana padaa yaa waapas hi mud janaa padaa
 This was my fourth visit to Kashmir
 pehle kii tarah, logon ne hamaara garmjoshi se swaagat kiya
 Even in this hour of hardship and sorrow, people invited us to their homes
 kaash! dilli yaa ahmedabad main bhi kashmiriyon kaa anubhav aisa hi hota
 i was once again shocked to see such prosperity in the rural economy
 gramin kashmir ke adhikansh logon ke paas bade or sundar ghar hai or ve behatar poshit bhi hai
 The terrible poverty found in the plains of North India is rarely seen here
 aadhikarik aankadon se is baat kii pushti bhi hoti he
 The social indicators of Jammu and Kashmir are definitely better than Gujarat, which the Prime Minister considers ideal
 yah vikaas ke kai pramukh sanketakon main ujagar he—udhaaharan ke liye jivan pratyaasha (gujarat ke 69 varsh kii tulana main jammu-kashmir main 74 varsh), bacchon kaa purna-tikaakaran kawarej (gujarat ke 50 pratishat ke mukaable jammu-kashmir main 75 pratishat) or gramin garibon kii sankhya kaa anupaat (jammu-kashmir main 12 pratishat or gujarat main 22 pratishat)
 * And those fearing a "population explosion" may be interested to know that Jammu and Kashmir is among India's lowest fertility states — just 1 per woman
 7 bachche jo ki pratisthaapan str se neeche he
 Incidentally, one of the main reasons for Jammu and Kashmir's rural economy to be relatively prosperous and egalitarian is that extensive land reforms took place in the 1950s and 1970s
 anuchhed 370 ke jariye bhoomi punarvitaran sambhav ho sakaa tha—us samay, sampatti kaa adhikaar bhartiya samvidhan ke tahat moulik adhikaar tha, lekin jammu-kashmir main yah kanoon lagu nahin tha kyonki uskaa apana samvidhan tha
 There is a general perception that Jammu and Kashmir is a "backward" area and Article 370 is responsible for this backwardness, but this has nothing to do with reality
 chunki ham kashmir main har taraf gaye, or har jagah hamane mahasoos kiya ki logon ke man main krodh or bhay ghar kar gaya he
 Apart from the BJP spokespersons of Kashmir in Srinagar, we have not found any person who supports the decision to repeal Article 370
 iske vipareet, unke rajya kii swaittata chhinane ke is prayaas ko lekar logon ke man main bahut aakrosh tha
 It is not that the people of Kashmir were satisfied with autonomy
 swaittata kii guarantee, jaisaa ki sarvavidit he or jaisaa ki purv ro pramukh e
 s
 dulat ne khulkar kaha bhi he, ''nammaatr'' kii rah gai thi
 Yet the abolition of that autonomy hurt the people of Kashmir; In a single stroke, all his aspirations were tried to be crushed forever and the way this work was done, he has been overwhelmed
 batmaalu main ek bujurg ne kaha, ''puure kashmir ko jail bana diya
 
 
 Removed Article 370 by tying us up
 '' kai anya logon ne bhi aisi hi baaten kahin
 Like anger, fear has deepened
 koi bhi camere par bolne ko raji nahin hua
 Whenever we were recording the talk of people, we had to take care that their faces should not be captured in the camera
 hamane logon ke naam bhi nahin likhe, taaki unke man main koi ashanka na rahe
 There is a reason for people to be afraid - after India's move on August 5, there have been a lot of arrests of people
 koi nahin jaanata ki kitne log giraftaar kiye gaye hai, ve kahaan hai, yaa unhen kab tak band rakhaa jayega
 The inference is that all important leaders, organizers and opponents were either arrested or put in lockup
 unamem se 'udaaravaadi' rajnatik dalon ke netaa bhi hai jinhone bharat ke saath baatcheet kii vakaalat kii thi
 As a Kashmiri man said, "those who sang the songs of India were also sent to jail
" '' kashmir main bharat samarthak netaaon kii sthiti sharmnaak ho gai he, unki vishwasaneeyata kaa sankat paidaa hua he or isse kattarpanthi tatwon ko badhaava mil saktaa he
 At one or two places where we had been out of sight of security forces for a while, and where a small crowd had gathered around us, people risked chanting some slogans, "what do we want?" 'freedom', 'bring Article 370 back!', Etc
 lekin ve jaldi hi teetar-bitar ho gaye
 Though these protests seemed very small, but these small protests spontaneously symbolized the culture of resistance in Kashmir which has deep roots
 jaisaa ki sopor main kisi ne kaha tha, ''jitna julm karenge, utana ubharenge
 On 10 August, we visited SMHS Hospital in Srinagar
 ham pellette gan ke do yuva peediton se mili, jinamein se ek kii ankhon kii roshni shaayad na laute
 It is painful to see a young man riddled with pills
 burhan vaani kii maut ke baad main aktubar, 2016 main kuch aise yuvaaon se mila, jab yahi ward pellette gan ke peediton se bharaa hua tha
 This time only 'two' (many victims prefer to be treated in private hospitals to avoid intelligence agents) but the hospital staff has prepared themselves for a possible wave of such victims for the next few months
 id kaa din, 12 agast, sabase dukhad din tha
 We went to many towns and villages but the roads were deserted and the markets closed wherever we went
 ikkaa-dukka, log nae kapade pahane yaa phir apane padosiyon ke saath qurbaani ke bhed ke maance ko baantate dikh rahe the
 But elsewhere there was only disappointment and desolation
 shaam ko hamane jafar (badla hua naam) ke ghar par kuch samay bitaayaa
 The 19-year-old Zafar was picked up by security forces on the night of August 5 and he had not returned home yet
 uski maa kaa ro-rokar bura haal ho gaya tha, or uske pita ko sabase badi anhoni kaa dar sata rahaa tha
 To understand their fear, we must remember that disappearance and torture are common in Kashmir
 jafar kii ek tasviir diwaar par lataki hui thi, maano us par ek maala daal die jane ko taiyaar ho
 We were returning on August 13, but the same darkness, the same despair, was in the valley
 tab tak virodh jataane kii chand ghatnaayen hi hui thim, lekin aisa isliye tha kyonki karfu jaisi sthiti bani hui thi or sanchaar ke sabhi saadhan band kar die gaye the
 Many expected the protests to be flooded if restrictions were lifted
 virodh chaahe kitne bhi shantipurna hon, kashmir main uski anumati nahin he, or vahaan bheed ko niyantrit karne ke jo nrushans tareeke aajamaae jate hai, unhen dekhte hue samuhik pradarshan jald hi suraksha balon ke saath badsoorat takaraavon main badal jate hai
 The sanctions are likely to be re-enforced to avoid further hassles
 hamaari yatra ke ek saptaah baad, sanket mil rahe hai ki aankh-michauni kaa yahi silsilaa phir shuru ho chukaa he
 It is unlikely that Kashmiris will soon succumb and accept the loss of autonomy as a thing of the past

 Janata Dal United has attacked the new terms of Union Minister and RLSP President Upendra Kushwaha
 upendra kushvaha ne endie main bane rahane ke liye apni 25 sutreey maang rakhi hai
 All these demands are related to education of which he himself is the Minister of State at the Center
 bihar main shiksha vyavastha kii sthiti kisi se chuphi nahi hai or isliye iske liye janata dal you ne sirf rajya sarkaar ko jimmedaar maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 Janata dal-u leader and former Education Minister Ashok Chaudhary said that Upendra Kushwaha has done nothing for the development of education in Bihar
 ve centre main maanav sansaadhan vikaas rajya mantri hai, is naate unki badi jimmedaari thi, lekin unhone shiksha ke kshetra main koi kaam nahin kiya
 Ashok Chaudhary said that his new condition is completely inspired by politics

 On the demand of Kushwaha, Janta Dal u spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that there are two types of education system in Bihar, out of which there is a shepherd school, which system they like
