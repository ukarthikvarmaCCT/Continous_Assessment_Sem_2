 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah has been admitted to AIIMS in Delhi after having swine flu
 unhone swayan apni sehat kii jaankaree dete hue twit kiya ki unhen swine flu hua he, jiskaa upachaar chal rahaa he or ve jald hi swasthy hokar lautenge
 The BJP president, who remains extremely active, may have an impact on the party's recent events under his leadership
 bengal main 5 reliyaan karne vaale the shahbijapi adhyaksh amit shah ke biimaar hone kaa sabase bada asar pashchim bengal main 20 janvari se shuru hone vaale party ke abhiyaan par pad saktaa he
 After the Supreme Court did not get the approval to take out the rath yatra in the state, bjp's state unit has prepared a blueprint for 5 national rallies of national president Amit Shah in West Bengal
 jisamen pehali jansabha malda jile main 20 janvari ko honi thi
 After this, on January 21, 2 rallies were to be held in Birbhum and West Midnapore
 vahiin 22 janvari ko 2 anya jansabhaayen dakshin 24 pargana or nadia jile main tay thi
 Apart from this, a big public meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been planned at Brigade Parade Ground in Kolkata on 8 February
 jise lekar taiyaariyaan joro par chal rahi hai
 In such a situation, without its captain, it can have a direct impact on the morale of bjp's Bengal unit
 karnataka main kya hoga?duusari taraf, karnataka ke 104 bijepi vidhayak purv mukhyamantri yediurappa ke saath rashtriya rajdhani dilli ke najadik gurugram ke ek hotel main camp kiye hue hai or yediurappa kii taraf se lagaataar party haikaman se mulaakaat kaa samay maanga ja rahaa tha
 It was believed that BJP President Amit Shah was going to meet the party mlas of Karnataka soon
 lihaaja shah kii gairmaujuudagi main bijepi kaa karnataka plan bhi khatai main pad saktaa he
 BJP is about to hold more than 50 press conferences In view of the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, BJP President Amit Shah has also started meeting for the party's election manifesto
 iske saath hi ve lagaataar vibhinn rajyon main shakti centre ke kaaryakartaaon, panna pramukhon or prabuddhajanon ke saath sammelan bhi kar rahe the
 The BJP has planned a press conference in 70 different places in the country in the next four days to spread the development work done by the Modi government at the Center
 in press conference ke jariye party piem modi or adhyaksh amit shah kaa sandesh aam logon tak pahunchaana chaahati he
 Union ministers, Chief Ministers, former Chief Ministers and senior mps of the party are to attend this press conference
 isi kram main swasthya mantri jepi nadda buudhvaar ko lakhanu main the, lekin shah ke biimaar hone kii khabar milte hi vah fouran dilli ke liye ravaanaa hue or ames pahunch gaye
 In such a situation, the question arises that how much the high command may have an impact on these large programs of the party
 shivaraj, vasundhara, raman ko banaaya gaya tha upaadhyakshahal hi main dilli main hue bijepi ke rashtriya adhiveshan main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke liye party padaadhikariyon ko jeet kaa mantra diya
 In this two-day program, many leaders were given the important responsibility of the party
 isse thik pehle madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main chunaav haar chuke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan, vasundhara raaje or raman singh ko party kaa upaadhyaksh banaaya gaya
 Now, with Shah's sudden ill, the responsibility of all these big leaders will increase, as well as their attention related to the general election strategy and also to the health of the party president
 rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ab puure bihar main 'berojgaare hataao, aarakshan bachaao' andolan karegi
 It was announced by Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav
 tejasvi guuruuvaar ko patna main yojit karpuri thakur jayanti par yojit party kii ek sabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 He said that a limit of up to eight lakh per annum has been kept in the new reservation system
 tejasvi ne poocha ki jo vyakti maheene main 66,666 rupee kamata he wo garib kaise he
 How does the government consider a person who gives Rs 72,500 as income tax poor
 is baithak main apane sambodhan main tejasvi ne kaha ko savarnon ke aarakshan ke wo virdohi nahin hai lekin jo modi sarkaar ne vyavastha kii he wo amir savarna ke liye aarakshan kii vyavastha kii gayi he
 Tejaswi Yadav said, 'we are opposing the way of implementing upper caste reservation
 bina kisi paddati, jaanch, ayog, survey or surveykshan ke inhone maatr chand ghanton main samvidhan se chhedchhad kar sanshodhan kar diya
 This reservation implemented in a hurry by the casteist Modi government will be like demonetisation
 piem modi kaa vipaksh par hamalaa, bole- agadi jati ke aarakshan se vipakshi dalon kii neend ud gaiunhone kaha, 'desh ke bahujan varshon se 50% fisadi aarakshan kii ceiling badhaane kii maang kar rahe the lekin anyaayi jativaadiyon ne nahin badhaayaa or naa hi badhane diya lekin savarna aarakshan bin maange chand ghanton main de diya
 Nagpuri casteists are not afraid of your vote
 samajhiye, ye aarakshan samaapti kii shuruyaat he
 Tell me, how was the poor earning 8 lakhs a year i
e
 Rs 66,666 a month? Brother is strange math? You have to pay 20% tax i
e
 Rs 72,500 annually after earning 8 lakhs annually
 jo vyakti 72500 rupee tex detaa he sarkaar use garibi kaa aarakshan de rahi he
 Wow ray scholars! Wow Modi ji! More than 28 thousand posts of reserved quota are vacant, OBC category is a big concern and now in 10% upper caste reservation, the Leader of Opposition said, 'they will also respect others and make themselves better than others in the varna system
 Will understand dusron kaa saamaajik tiraskaar bhi karenge
 Will make fun of their caste
 shoshan karenge lekin samanta kaa adhikaar nahin denge
 Neither will their caste be counted nor will they be allowed to happen
 wo asamanta ke pakshdhar hai
 The anti-reservation first shouted merit-merit, calling reservation as begging
 ab bahut kush hai
 These dualists will not work
 yaa to aap ye maniye ki aap jativaadee hai or yogya va pratibhashali dalit-pichhadon kii haqamaari main lage hai yaa phir ye maniye kii aap saamaajik shreshthata ke aadhaar par aarakshan ke sabase bade adhikari hai
 They will not even allow you to count your caste by misusing the post and will not even count their caste because this will open their poll as to how a handful of people have captured all the regions and resources of the country on the basis of ethnic muscle power and fraud
 hamane ladaai thaan lee he ab chaahe jail jaaen yaa goli lage, ladenge
 'ujjain of RJD on Reservation on Economic Basis: Raghuvansh Prasad said - In Parliament we have missed that while the current quota for scheduled castes and tribes should be increased, the present 27 per cent for backward castes should be provided 40 per cent
 needed
 tejasvi ne saamaajik or jatigat aarakshan ke aankadon ko bhi saarvajanik karne ke liye centre sarkaar se ek baar phir aagrah kiya
 It is clear from the rjd's attitude that on the one hand it is showing fear of ending the reservation system on the one hand, while on the other hand it is also trying to mobilize them in its favor by demanding more quota for backward and scheduled castes

 But by the time of his second child, his father became a professor of English, so he kept the name 'happy', thanking the changed days
 lekin happy ko jivan kii nirnaayak khushi 2005 main us bade bhai baapi vishwajit se mili, jab ve donon enesdy main pravesh kii kaaryshaala main pahunche
 Father did not prepare Happy for this, but made Bapi fiercely prepared
 vahaan yah bataae jane par ki donon bhaaiyon main se ek hi ko liya ja saktaa he, baapi ne bina palak jhapake kah diya ki happy ko le liya jaae
 This sacrifice of brother to Happy on every special moment still makes him emotional

 When the rupee weakened against the dollar, it seemed that many Union ministers must have been tweeting, because many of them used to tweet heavily on this rupee weakness in 2013, press conference
 aaj jab rupaya aitihaasik rup se kamazor hua to har din kii jagah itihaas kaa koi na koi topic le aane vaale netaaon ne bhi ise nazarandaaz kar diya
 You will be aware that on 28 June, the price of one dollar in India's 69 rupees
 0925 rupee ho gai
 The rupee had never fallen so low against the dollar
 november 2016 main 68 rupee 86 paise ho gaya tha
 When the rupee reached 68 rupees 63 paise against the dollar on 26 June, experts were hoping that it would soon surpass the record of 28 August 2013
 jab ek dollar kaa bhav 68 rupee 83 paise ho gaya tha
 But even from 28 August 2013, it went beyond 69
 ye to kahie ki bazaar band hone tak 68 rupee 78 paise par aa gaya
 Wish this day was any day of the year of 2013, there would have been a lot of uproar on it, but times have changed
 bas rupee ko pataa nahin ki vakt badla he, use lekar politics karne vaale beshak badal gaye hon
 With the coming of power, it makes sense, so there is silence because now they know when and for what reasons the price of rupee can fall and climb
 isliye jab hamane vitt mantralay ke twitor handle ko check kiya to vahaan bhartiya rupee ke aitihaasik giravat par kuch nahin mila, swasthya laabh kar rahe vitt mantri arun jetali ke blog ko check kiya to vahaan bhi bhartiya rupee ke aitihaasik giravat par koi blog nahin tha
 Then we checked the Twitter handle of temporary finance minister Piyush Goyal, then there was nothing on the historical fall of the rupee
 itnaa sannata pasra tha jaise dollar hi bhartiya rupee ke mukaable ludhak gaya ho
 Then a viewer sent the 2013 statement of Finance Minister Jaitley
 pehle aap wo sun len phir ham aage badhenge
 You heard that while giving a speech in Rajya Sabha on June 2013 while in opposition, Arun Jaitley is saying that the Prime Minister will not speak
 na tab bole na ab ke pradhanmantri is par bole
 There is a big change in the politics of India that the old statement of everyone is found immediately in the recorded state
 pataa nahin sabase pehle koun khojataa he or sabase pehle koun bhejtaa he
 a tweet by Shri Sri Ravi Shankar also keeps circulating, the old one in which he says that it is refreshing to know that the price of a dollar will come to 40 rupees as soon as Narendra Modi becomes Prime Minister
 chaar saal baad chalis rupee to dur ulta 69 rupaya ho gaya
 Weakened even more than Manmohan's visit
 tab yah masalaa kaaphi bada hota tha, ab kyon nahin he? yah aap whatsap uniwarsity waalon se puuchhie
 There was a debate in Parliament on this issue
 hamaari raajnneeti kab kis masale ko apane liye avasar bana detii he, yah ham or aap tab samajhate hai jab ve avasar kaa laabh le ja chuke hote hai
 Therefore, this struggle goes on between the public and the leader, which one is more sensible among the two
 zyaadaatar baar netaa hi baari padate hai
 The record of the rupee's fall so far is only on 28 August 2013, and a day after that on 29 August 2013, Arun Jaitley says in the Rajya Sabha that i will give only two examples
 vitt mantri zaruri aayaat kii baat karte rahe hai
 Of course oil is an important import, edible oil is a necessary import
 parantu hamaare paas is desh main koyale kaa bhandar hai
 We have more coal than we need
 pichley 6-7 varshon main koyale kii arthvyavastha kaa kuprabandhan hua he
 As a result, we have to spend $ 20 billion on coal imports
 vitt mantri pi chidambaram ko arun jetali bataa rahe hai ki kin halaat main rupaya dollar ke mukaable itnaa gira he
 Saying that the situation would have been better had it not been spent on import of coal and if we had extracted our own coal
 magar jab jetali vitt mantri bane or piyush goly koyala mantri tab kya kuch badal gaya, kyonki aaj bhi rupee kii keemat girti ja rahi he or vittiya ghate par dabaav bad rahaa he
 In the 'business Standard' dated May 17, 2018, Jayjit Das wrote that in 2017-18, 213 million tonnes of coal were imported, an increase of 8 percent from the previous year and it cost $ 22 billion
 yani jo sthiti 2013 main thi vahi 2017 main bhi rahi
 Politics does not change with this kind of research, it moves with deception and misleading
 manmohan singh ne pradhanmantri ke taur par jetali kii maang kaa jawaab bhi diya tha 30 agast 2013 ko
 See what a coincidence
 desh ke baahar kuch apratyaashit ghatnaon se bazaar par vipareet pratikriya hui he, jiske kaaran rupee kii keemat main tezi se giravat ai
 On May 22, 2013, the US Central Bank indicated that it would soon reduce the quantitative value gradually, as the US economy is slowly improving
 isse ubhartee hui arthvyavasthaaon main puunji ke pravaah par vipareet prabhaav padaa, jiske kaaran na sirf rupee main balki brazil kii riyal, turki kii lira, indonesia ke rupia, dakshin africa ke rand or anya mudraon main bhi tezi se giravat aa rahi he
 If Prime Minister Modi had spoken on this today, he would have been speaking around it, because the situation today is also similar
 tab syria or kachche tel ke daamon main vruddhi tha ab america china ke bich vyapaar yuddh he or kachche telon ke daamon main baari vruddhi he
 But India's politics is not driven by logic
 vah bhaawanaaon se tay hoti he
 At that time Prime Minister Narendra Modi used to tweet continuously with his Twitter handle, when the rupee had historically been 68 rupees 83 paise against a dollar, today it fell even lower then what to say that the Prime Minister is responsible for this The government is responsible, what can be said that there is a falling competition between the current government and the rupee
 pradhanmantri modi ke puraane twit dikhaane kaa yahi makasad tha ki ham rupee ke girane kii raajnneeti or uske kaarnon ko alag-alag or thik se samajhen
 Do not understand the way leaders often explain
 jaankaar kah rahe hai ki ek dollar kii keemat 70 rupee ho jaaegi
 In an article on Bloomberg's site, DBM Bank believes that by June 2019, the price of a dollar can be up to Rs 71
 shrishri ravishankar hi bataa sakate hai ki ve ab rupee kii keemat ko lekar kya sochate hai, kya unhen abhi bhi lagata he ki modi ji 40 rupee kar denge
 Interest rates may increase in the coming days
 mahangaai par bhi asar pad saktaa he or tel ke daamon par to padegaa hi agar yahi halaat bane rahe to
 Market expert Sunil Shah has said that the worldwide trade rates have slowed due to the trade war between the US and China
 bharat bhi bachaa nahin rahegaa
 India will also have to cut growth projections
 is vakt duniya ke bazaar main kaaphi anischitata he
 For the victory of the trump at Jantar Mantar, search the people who performed the havan from somewhere, they would do the havan again to be considered the trump
 is vakt barish ke liye medhak-mendhaki kii shaadi rachaane se zyada emportent ye kaam he
 The people of the Hindu army had done a havan in jantar-mantar to wish Trump victory
 ab agar ve phir se havan karen or bharat daure par ain niki heli ko havan main bula len to kya pataa china ke saath vyapaarik sangharsh tham jaae
 It should also be resolved in that havan that America should not force India to stop importing oil from Iran
 sanyukt raashtra main america kii rajdoot nikki heli is vakt bharat ke daure par hai, unhone kaha he ki america chahta he ki bharat iran se kachche tel kaa aayaat band kar den or heli ne kaha yah baat pradhanmantri modi acchhee tarah se samajhate bhi hai
 The rupee has fallen more than 7 percent against the dollar this year
 asia main sabase kharaab pradarshan bhartiya mudra kaa hi he
 Should not the ministers writing and tweeting in the government speak on the new situation, which would have made it clear in the minds of the people that the rupee was weakening even during Manmohan Singh, the rupee was weakening even during Modi
 is
 kya kaarnon main koi change aayaa he, matlab yaa phir ye ek aisa pattern he jo kisi kii bhi sarkaar kii parvaah nahin karata he
 Another good news is that the deposits of Indians in Swiss bank has increased by 50%
 7000 karod ho gaya he
 The comments 2017 main 7000 karod ho gaya
 How did it grow there after a year of demonetisation
 khayr swiss bank main jamaa har paisa kaala dhan nahin hota he, isliye aap prime time dekhte hue turant ye ummid na paalen ki aapke khate main 15 lakh aane kaa time aa gaya he
 The news is that for three years there was a decline in the money deposited there
 2017 main duniya bhar ke videshi graahakon kaa swiss bank main jo paisa jamaa hua he, usamen maatr 3 pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 Of this, Indian customers have a fifty percent jump in deposits
 2016 main 45 pratishat kii giravat ai thi
 This is all in the Swiss National Bank released its annual data on 28 June
 swiss bank kii khyaati bharat main kuch aisi hi ho gai he ki isse sambandhit koi bhi jaankaree kaale dhan kaa hi sanket detii he
 Our politicians and babas have worked hard on this
 aaj tak to vahaan se dhela nahin aayaa magar jaise hi zikr karo lagata he ki kaala dhan vahiin gada hua he
 Many times there is already a hint that when the video will come, whose birth anniversary, whose death anniversary, everyone knows that this will not solve anyone's immediate problem, but the media tells by night that what you were thinking Were thinking all right pahaado se nikalate suraj vaale gudmorning massej kii tarah nehru kaa to masalaa ab sthaayee ho gaya he

 When the rupee reached 68 rupees 63 paise against the dollar on 26 June, experts were hoping that it would soon surpass the record of 28 August 2013
 jab ek dollar kaa bhav 68 rupee 83 paise ho gaya tha
 But even from 28 August 2013, it went beyond 69
 ye to kahie ki bazaar band hone tak 68 rupee 78 paise par aa gaya
 Wish this day was any day of the year of 2013, there would have been a lot of uproar on it, but times have changed
 bas rupee ko pataa nahin ki vakt badla he, use lekar politics karne vaale beshak badal gaye hon
 With the coming of power, it makes sense, so there is silence because now they know when and for what reasons the price of rupee can fall and climb
 isliye jab hamane vitt mantralay ke twitor handle ko check kiya to vahaan bhartiya rupee ke aitihaasik giravat par kuch nahin mila, swasthya laabh kar rahe vitt mantri arun jetali ke blog ko check kiya to vahaan bhi bhartiya rupee ke aitihaasik giravat par koi blog nahin tha
 Then we checked the Twitter handle of temporary finance minister Piyush Goyal, then there was nothing on the historical fall of the rupee
 itnaa sannata pasra tha jaise dollar hi bhartiya rupee ke mukaable ludhak gaya ho
 Then a viewer sent the 2013 statement of Finance Minister Jaitley
 pehle aap wo sun len phir ham aage badhenge
 You heard that while giving a speech in Rajya Sabha on June 2013 while in opposition, Arun Jaitley is saying that the Prime Minister will not speak
 na tab bole na ab ke pradhanmantri is par bole
 There is a big change in the politics of India that the old statement of everyone is found immediately in the recorded state
 pataa nahin sabase pehle koun khojataa he or sabase pehle koun bhejtaa he
 a tweet by Shri Sri Ravi Shankar also keeps circulating, the old one in which he says that it is refreshing to know that the price of a dollar will come to 40 rupees as soon as Narendra Modi becomes Prime Minister
 chaar saal baad chalis rupee to dur ulta 69 rupaya ho gaya
 Weakened even more than Manmohan's visit
 tab yah masalaa kaaphi bada hota tha, ab kyon nahin he? yah aap whatsap uniwarsity waalon se puuchhie
 There was a debate in Parliament on this issue
 hamaari raajnneeti kab kis masale ko apane liye avasar bana detii he, yah ham or aap tab samajhate hai jab ve avasar kaa laabh le ja chuke hote hai
 Therefore, this struggle goes on between the public and the leader, which one is more sensible among the two
 zyaadaatar baar netaa hi baari padate hai
 The record of the rupee's fall so far is only on 28 August 2013, and a day after that on 29 August 2013, Arun Jaitley says in the Rajya Sabha that i will give only two examples
 vitt mantri zaruri aayaat kii baat karte rahe hai
 Of course oil is an important import, edible oil is a necessary import
 parantu hamaare paas is desh main koyale kaa bhandar hai
 We have more coal than we need
 pichley 6-7 varshon main koyale kii arthvyavastha kaa kuprabandhan hua he
 As a result, we have to spend $ 20 billion on coal imports
 vitt mantri pi chidambaram ko arun jetali bataa rahe hai ki kin halaat main rupaya dollar ke mukaable itnaa gira he
 Saying that the situation would have been better had it not been spent on import of coal and if we had extracted our own coal
 magar jab jetali vitt mantri bane or piyush goly koyala mantri tab kya kuch badal gaya, kyonki aaj bhi rupee kii keemat girti ja rahi he or vittiya ghate par dabaav bad rahaa he
 In the 'business Standard' dated May 17, 2018, Jayjit Das wrote that in 2017-18, 213 million tonnes of coal were imported, an increase of 8 percent from the previous year and it cost $ 22 billion
 yani jo sthiti 2013 main thi vahi 2017 main bhi rahi
 Politics does not change with this kind of research, it moves with deception and misleading
 manmohan singh ne pradhanmantri ke taur par jetali kii maang kaa jawaab bhi diya tha 30 agast 2013 ko
 See what a coincidence
 desh ke baahar kuch apratyaashit ghatnaon se bazaar par vipareet pratikriya hui he, jiske kaaran rupee kii keemat main tezi se giravat ai
 On May 22, 2013, the US Central Bank indicated that it would soon reduce the quantitative value gradually, as the US economy is slowly improving
 isse ubhartee hui arthvyavasthaaon main puunji ke pravaah par vipareet prabhaav padaa, jiske kaaran na sirf rupee main balki brazil kii riyal, turki kii lira, indonesia ke rupia, dakshin africa ke rand or anya mudraon main bhi tezi se giravat aa rahi he
 If Prime Minister Modi had spoken on this today, he would have been speaking around it, because the situation today is also similar
 tab syria or kachche tel ke daamon main vruddhi tha ab america china ke bich vyapaar yuddh he or kachche telon ke daamon main baari vruddhi he
 But India's politics is not driven by logic
 vah bhaawanaaon se tay hoti he
 At that time Prime Minister Narendra Modi used to tweet continuously with his Twitter handle, when the rupee had historically been 68 rupees 83 paise against a dollar, today it fell even lower then what to say that the Prime Minister is responsible for this The government is responsible, what can be said that there is a falling competition between the current government and the rupee
 pradhanmantri modi ke puraane twit dikhaane kaa yahi makasad tha ki ham rupee ke girane kii raajnneeti or uske kaarnon ko alag-alag or thik se samajhen
 Do not understand the way leaders often explain
 jaankaar kah rahe hai ki ek dollar kii keemat 70 rupee ho jaaegi
 In an article on Bloomberg's site, DBM Bank believes that by June 2019, the price of a dollar can be up to Rs 71
 shrishri ravishankar hi bataa sakate hai ki ve ab rupee kii keemat ko lekar kya sochate hai, kya unhen abhi bhi lagata he ki modi ji 40 rupee kar denge
 Interest rates may increase in the coming days
 mahangaai par bhi asar pad saktaa he or tel ke daamon par to padegaa hi agar yahi halaat bane rahe to
 Market expert Sunil Shah has said that the worldwide trade rates have slowed due to the trade war between the US and China
 bharat bhi bachaa nahin rahegaa
 India will also have to cut growth projections
 is vakt duniya ke bazaar main kaaphi anischitata he
 For the victory of the trump at Jantar Mantar, search the people who performed the havan from somewhere, they would do the havan again to be considered the trump
 is vakt barish ke liye medhak-mendhaki kii shaadi rachaane se zyada emportent ye kaam he
 The people of the Hindu army had done a havan in jantar-mantar to wish Trump victory
 ab agar ve phir se havan karen or bharat daure par ain niki heli ko havan main bula len to kya pataa china ke saath vyapaarik sangharsh tham jaae
 It should also be resolved in that havan that America should not force India to stop importing oil from Iran
 sanyukt raashtra main america kii rajdoot nikki heli is vakt bharat ke daure par hai, unhone kaha he ki america chahta he ki bharat iran se kachche tel kaa aayaat band kar den or heli ne kaha yah baat pradhanmantri modi acchhee tarah se samajhate bhi hai
 The rupee has fallen more than 7 percent against the dollar this year
 asia main sabase kharaab pradarshan bhartiya mudra kaa hi he
 Should not the ministers writing and tweeting in the government speak on the new situation, which would have made it clear in the minds of the people that the rupee was weakening even during Manmohan Singh, the rupee was weakening even during Modi
 is
 kya kaarnon main koi change aayaa he, matlab yaa phir ye ek aisa pattern he jo kisi kii bhi sarkaar kii parvaah nahin karata he
 Another good news is that the deposits of Indians in Swiss bank has increased by 50%
 7000 karod ho gaya he
 The comments 2017 main 7000 karod ho gaya
 How did it grow there after a year of demonetisation
 khayr swiss bank main jamaa har paisa kaala dhan nahin hota he, isliye aap prime time dekhte hue turant ye ummid na paalen ki aapke khate main 15 lakh aane kaa time aa gaya he
 The news is that for three years there was a decline in the money deposited there
 2017 main duniya bhar ke videshi graahakon kaa swiss bank main jo paisa jamaa hua he, usamen maatr 3 pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 Of this, Indian customers have a fifty percent jump in deposits
 2016 main 45 pratishat kii giravat ai thi
 This is all in the Swiss National Bank released its annual data on 28 June
 swiss bank kii khyaati bharat main kuch aisi hi ho gai he ki isse sambandhit koi bhi jaankaree kaale dhan kaa hi sanket detii he
 Our politicians and babas have worked hard on this
 aaj tak to vahaan se dhela nahin aayaa magar jaise hi zikr karo lagata he ki kaala dhan vahiin gada hua he
 You will be aware that on 28 June, the price of one dollar in India's 69 rupees
 0925 rupee ho gai
 The rupee had never fallen so low against the dollar

 isse ubhartee hui arthvyavasthaaon main puunji ke pravaah par vipareet prabhaav padaa, jiske kaaran na sirf rupee main balki brazil kii riyal, turki kii lira, indonesia ke rupia, dakshin africa ke rand or anya mudraon main bhi tezi se giravat aa rahi he
 If Prime Minister Modi had spoken on this today, he would have been speaking around it, because the situation today is also similar
 tab syria or kachche tel ke daamon main vruddhi tha ab america china ke bich vyapaar yuddh he or kachche telon ke daamon main baari vruddhi he
 But India's politics is not driven by logic
 vah bhaawanaaon se tay hoti he
 At that time Prime Minister Narendra Modi used to tweet continuously with his Twitter handle, when the rupee had historically been 68 rupees 83 paise against a dollar, today it fell even lower then what to say that the Prime Minister is responsible for this The government is responsible, what can be said that there is a falling competition between the current government and the rupee
 pradhanmantri modi ke puraane twit dikhaane kaa yahi makasad tha ki ham rupee ke girane kii raajnneeti or uske kaarnon ko alag-alag or thik se samajhen
 Do not understand the way leaders often explain
 jaankaar kah rahe hai ki ek dollar kii keemat 70 rupee ho jaaegi
 In an article on Bloomberg's site, DBM Bank believes that by June 2019, the price of a dollar can be up to Rs 71
 shrishri ravishankar hi bataa sakate hai ki ve ab rupee kii keemat ko lekar kya sochate hai, kya unhen abhi bhi lagata he ki modi ji 40 rupee kar denge
 Interest rates may increase in the coming days
 mahangaai par bhi asar pad saktaa he or tel ke daamon par to padegaa hi agar yahi halaat bane rahe to
 Market expert Sunil Shah has said that the worldwide trade rates have slowed due to the trade war between the US and China
 bharat bhi bachaa nahin rahegaa
 India will also have to cut growth projections
 is vakt duniya ke bazaar main kaaphi anischitata he
 For the victory of the trump at Jantar Mantar, search the people who performed the havan from somewhere, they would do the havan again to be considered the trump
 is vakt barish ke liye medhak-mendhaki kii shaadi rachaane se zyada emportent ye kaam he
 The people of the Hindu army had done a havan in jantar-mantar to wish Trump victory
 ab agar ve phir se havan karen or bharat daure par ain niki heli ko havan main bula len to kya pataa china ke saath vyapaarik sangharsh tham jaae
 It should also be resolved in that havan that America should not force India to stop importing oil from Iran
 sanyukt raashtra main america kii rajdoot nikki heli is vakt bharat ke daure par hai, unhone kaha he ki america chahta he ki bharat iran se kachche tel kaa aayaat band kar den or heli ne kaha yah baat pradhanmantri modi acchhee tarah se samajhate bhi hai
 The rupee has fallen more than 7 percent against the dollar this year
 asia main sabase kharaab pradarshan bhartiya mudra kaa hi he
 Should not the ministers writing and tweeting in the government speak on the new situation, which would have made it clear in the minds of the people that the rupee was weakening even during Manmohan Singh, the rupee was weakening even during Modi
 is
 kya kaarnon main koi change aayaa he, matlab yaa phir ye ek aisa pattern he jo kisi kii bhi sarkaar kii parvaah nahin karata he
 Another good news is that the deposits of Indians in Swiss bank has increased by 50%
 7000 karod ho gaya he
 The comments 2017 main 7000 karod ho gaya
 How did it grow there after a year of demonetisation
 khayr swiss bank main jamaa har paisa kaala dhan nahin hota he, isliye aap prime time dekhte hue turant ye ummid na paalen ki aapke khate main 15 lakh aane kaa time aa gaya he
 The news is that for three years there was a decline in the money deposited there
 2017 main duniya bhar ke videshi graahakon kaa swiss bank main jo paisa jamaa hua he, usamen maatr 3 pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 Of this, Indian customers have a fifty percent jump in deposits
 2016 main 45 pratishat kii giravat ai thi
 This is all in the Swiss National Bank released its annual data on 28 June
 swiss bank kii khyaati bharat main kuch aisi hi ho gai he ki isse sambandhit koi bhi jaankaree kaale dhan kaa hi sanket detii he
 Our politicians and babas have worked hard on this
 aaj tak to vahaan se dhela nahin aayaa magar jaise hi zikr karo lagata he ki kaala dhan vahiin gada hua he
 Four years later, forty rupees was turned away to 69 rupees
 manmohan ke daure se bhi zyada kamazor ho gaya
 At that time this issue used to be quite big, now why not? Ask this to the people of whatsapp University
 sansad main baqayda bahes hui thi is masale par
 When our politics makes which issue an opportunity for ourselves, we and you understand when they have taken advantage of the opportunity
 isliye janata or netaa ke bich yah sangharsh chalata rahata he ki donon main se koun kisase zyada samajhadaar he
 Most of the times, leaders are overshadowed
 rupee ke girane kaa ab tak kaa record 28 agast 2013 kaa hi he or uske thik ek din baad 29 agast 2013 ko rajya sabha main arun jetali is vishay par kehete hai ki main sirf do udhaaharan duungaa
 The Finance Minister has been talking about essential imports
 beshak tel ek zaruri aayaat he, khaane vaala tel zaruri aayaat he
 But we have coal reserves in this country
 hamaare paas aavashyaktaa se adhik koyala he
 There has been a mismanagement of the coal economy in the last 6-7 years
 iske parinamswaroop, hamen koyale ke aayaat par 20 billian dollar kharch karnaa padaa he
 Finance Minister p Chidambaram is telling Arun Jaitley that under which circumstances the rupee has fallen so much against the dollar
 kahana chaah rahe hai ki agar koyale ke aayaat par itnaa kharch nahin hota or ham apana hi koyala nikaal lete to sthiti behatar hoti
 But what changed when Jaitley became finance minister and Piyush Golay coal minister, because even today the value of rupee is falling and pressure on financial deficit is increasing
 17 may 2018 ke 'bijness standard' main jayajit das ne likhaa he ki 2017-18 main 213 million ton koyale kaa aayaat hua jo pichley saal se 8 pratishat zyada he or is par 22 arab dollar kharch hua
 That is, the situation in 2013 was the same in 2017
 raajnneeti is tarah ke research se nahin badalati he, wo chalati he bahalane phuslane or bhatakaane se
 Manmohan Singh had also responded to Jaitley's demand as Prime Minister on 30 August 2013
 kya sanyog he dekhie
 The market has reacted adversely to some unforeseen events outside the country, causing the rupee to fall sharply
 22 may 2013 ko yues central bank ne yah sanket diya tha ki vah jald hi maatraatmak mulya main dhire-dhire kami laaegaa, kyonki america kii arthvyavastha main dhire-dhire sudhaar ho rahaa he
 This adversely affected the flow of capital in emerging economies, causing a sharp decline in not only the rupee but also the Brazilian riyal, Turkish lira, Indonesian rupiah, South African rand and other currencies
 agar aaj pradhanmantri modi is par bolte to ve kareeb-kareeb isi ke aas paas bol rahe hote, kyonki aaj ke halaat bhi isi tarah ke hai
 There was a rise in the prices of Syria and crude oil then there is trade war between USA China and there is a huge increase in the prices of crude oil
 lekin bharat kii raajnneeti tarkon se nahin chalati he
 She is determined by emotions
 us vakt pradhanmantri narendra modi apane twitor handle se lagaataar twit kiya tha karte thetab rupaya aitihaasik rup se ek dollar ke mukaable 68 rupee 83 paise hi hua tha, aaj to yah usase bhi neeche gira to kya kaha jaae ki iske liye pradhanmantri zimmedaar hai, sarkaar zimmedaar he, kya kaha jaae ki maujuuda sarkaar or rupee ke bich girane kii pratiyogita chhidi hui he
 The intention of showing the old tweets of Prime Minister Modi was that we should understand the politics of the fall of the rupee and its reasons separately and properly
 vaise hi na samajhen jaise netaa aksar samajha dete hai
 Experts are saying that the price of one dollar will be 70 rupees
 bloomberg kii site par ek lekh main dibiem bank kaa maananaa he ki june 2019 tak ek dollar kii keemat 71 rupee tak bhi ho sakati he
 Only Shri Sri Ravi Shankar can tell what he thinks about the value of rupee now, does he still think that Modi ji will make 40 rupees
 aane vaale dinon main byaaz daren bad sakati hai
 Inflation can also be affected and oil prices will be affected if the same conditions persist
 bazaar ke jaankaar sunil shah ne kaha he ki america or china ke bich vyapaar yuddh ke kaaran duniya bhar main jidipi kii daren dhimi ho gayi hai
 India will also not be saved
 bharat ko bhi vikaas dar ke anumaanon main katautee kerani hogi
 There is a lot of uncertainty in the world market at this time
 jantar mantar par trump kii jeet ke liye havan karne vaale logon ko kahin se khoj kar laaiye, ve phir se havan karen ki trump maan jaaen
 At this time, it is more important to make rain-frog weddings more important than getting married
 hindu sena ke logon ne jantar-mantar par trump kii jeet kii kaamana main havan kiya tha
 Now if they do the havan again and call Nikki Haley who is on a tour of India, they know if the trade conflict with China will stop
 us havan main yah bhi sankalp liya jaae ki america bharat ko iran se tel aayaat roak dene par majaboor na kare
 US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley is currently visiting India, he has said that the US wants India to stop importing crude oil from Iran and Haley said that Prime Minister Modi understands this very well
 is saal rupaya dollar ke mukaable 7 pratishat se zyada gir chukaa he
 Indian currency is the worst performer in Asia
 kya sarkaar main blog likhane vaale or twit karne vaale mantriyon ko nai paristhiti par nahin bolnaa chahie, jisase logon ke man main yah baat saaf hoti ki manmohan singh ke samay bhi rupaya kamazor ho ja rahaa tha, modi ke samay bhi rupaya kamazor hua ja rahaa he
 Has there been any change in the reasons, meaning or is it a pattern that nobody cares about the government
 ek or acchhee khabar he ki swiss bank main bharatiyon kaa jamaa paisa 50 percent bad gaya he
 7000 crore
 tippaniyan 7000 crores in 2017
 ye notebandi ke ek saal baad kaise vahaan bad gaya
 Well, not every penny deposited in Swiss bank is black money, so you should not immediately expect that the time has come to your account to get 15 lakhs while watching prime time
 khabar isamen ye he ki teen saal tak vahaan jamaa paise main giravat aa rahi thi
 In 2017, the amount of money deposited by Swiss customers around the world in Swiss bank has increased by only 3 percent
 isame se bhartiya graahakon kii jamaa raashi main oochaal pachaas pratishat he
 There was a 45 percent drop in 2016
 28 june ko swiss neshnal bank ne jo apana salanaa data jari kiya he usee main ye sab he
 The reputation of Swiss bank has become something similar in India that any information related to it indicates only black money
 iske peeche hamaare rajanetaaon or baabaaon ne kaaphi mehnat kii he
 Till date we have not been pushed from there, but as soon as you think that black money is buried there
 vitt mantri pi chidambaram ko arun jetali bataa rahe hai ki kin halaat main rupaya dollar ke mukaable itnaa gira he
 Saying that the situation would have been better had it not been spent on import of coal and if we had extracted our own coal
 magar jab jetali vitt mantri bane or piyush goly koyala mantri tab kya kuch badal gaya, kyonki aaj bhi rupee kii keemat girti ja rahi he or vittiya ghate par dabaav bad rahaa he
 In the 'business Standard' dated May 17, 2018, Jayjit Das wrote that in 2017-18, 213 million tonnes of coal were imported, an increase of 8 percent from the previous year and it cost $ 22 billion
 yani jo sthiti 2013 main thi vahi 2017 main bhi rahi
 Politics does not change with this kind of research, it moves with deception and misleading
 manmohan singh ne pradhanmantri ke taur par jetali kii maang kaa jawaab bhi diya tha 30 agast 2013 ko
 See what a coincidence
 desh ke baahar kuch apratyaashit ghatnaon se bazaar par vipareet pratikriya hui he, jiske kaaran rupee kii keemat main tezi se giravat ai

 Sorry sorry sorry a farmer was killed in police firing on Monday in Nanded village of Sangli district of Maharashtra
 is puure mudde par siyasat garmati najar aa rahi he
 While Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan termed the violent protests of farmers as wrong, social activist Anna Hazare said that the government does not think about the interest of farmers
 gauratlab he pashchim maharashtra ke sangli, satara or kolhapur ke sahakaari chini milon main is mausam main ganna kii kharid par 3000 rupaye prati ton agrim raashi ke taur par die jane se inkaar ke khilaaf kisaan pradarshan kar rahe hai
 The mills have been agreed to pay 2300 rupees per ton
 police ke mutabik, saansad or swabhimani shetakari sanghathan ke netaa raju shetty ke aahvaan par kisaanon ne pashchimi maharashtra ke kai hisson main sadak jam kiya
 He said that a group of farmers in Nanded village attempted to shut down a police team at the hotel after which Pusi lathi-charged and opened fire in which Chandrakant Nalawade was injured
 rajkeey aspataal ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki aspataal le jane ke dauraan ghayal nalavade kii maut ho gai
 During the agitation, a farmer was killed in police firing in Sangli district
 uske parivaar waalon ne ye maang kii thi kii is ghatana kii jaanch ho or unako muaavja milanaa chahie
 He had refused to take a dead body without any firm assurance
 maharashtra ke punarvaas mantri patangrao kadam ne kaha, 'hamane chandrakant nalavade ke parivaar kii puri zimmedaari le lee he
 Soon they will get compensation
 ham magistrate ke jariye isaki jaanch karaayenge
 This incident is unfortunate
 aisi sthiti main ham unka saath nahin chhod rahe hai
 'sharad Pawar said on this issue,' If Raju Shetty is really concerned about the farmers, first close the factories in your area and then go to other areas
 khud kii dukaan chaalu rakhte ho or duusare kii dukaan band karavaate ho ye kahaan se thik he
 'now players are going to travel from Delhi to jump into this riot by Sharad Pawar
 arvind kejariwal yarvada jail main band raju shetty se milane pune pahunchane vaale hai to anna hajaare ne bhi raju shetty ke samarthan kaa elaan kar diya he
 Anna Hazare said, 'whether it is the state government or the central government, the welfare of the farmers is not thinking
 sarkaar kisaanon ke hit main kaam nahin kar rahi he
 The production cost of the farmers should be given to the farmers
 'anna ne aage kaha, 'krishi pradhan bharat desh me videshi companiyon ko sarkaar puri suvidha detii he
 The sugarcane movement is for the benefit of the farmers and the government feels that if it is wrong, then talk to the farmers and find a solution, how far is it right to shoot
 'kisaanon ke hinsak pradarshan ke baad police kii karrwai ke bare main anna hajaare bole, 'ye thik nahin he
 The constitution has given the right to agitate
 It is not a sin to agitate, but do not damage national property
 ' With the deployment of additional troops in Jammu and Kashmir, the market of such discussions has also become hot that something big is going to happen in the state
 atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki sarkaar artical 35 e (article 35 A)yaa dhara 370 (article 370) ko hataane kii taiyaari main he

 sarkaar ke varisht adhikariyon dwaara hastakshrit farji aadesh faile hai
 It cannot be dismissed as merely saying something
 sibiai se is farji aadesh or uske mul kii jaanch karne ko kaha janaa chahie
 This is a very serious matter raised by the Governor
 Fake orders were circulated under the signature of senior government officers
 This is not something that can be dismissed with a simple sound byte
 The CBI must be asked to investigate these fake orders & their origin

 They even demanded the poisoning of leaders like Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad
 unhone lalu par 'tharmametre' lagaakar raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bihar ko luutane vaale aise netaaon ko jehar de dena chahie yaa phir faansee par lataka dena chahie
 'provide security to Kanhaiya' nitish'yadav said that Lalu has no meaning with any movement
 ye log vot ke saudagar hai
 Lalu does not mean any problem, he only does vote bank politics
 bahubali saansad ne kaha ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko agar sahi myne main jeenyu chaatr sangh ke adhyakshakanhaiya kumaaraki chintaa he to sabase pehle use suraksha muhaiyaa karaaen

 In fact, the way India removed Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir recently and it got a sharp reaction in Pakistan, the tension has also increased due to the relationship between the two countries
 is bich bharat kii sainya kshamtaaon main lagaataar ijapha ho rahaa he
 For example, on September 3, India took eight Apache helicopters out of a total of 22 from the US, while on October 8, it also acquired the first Rafale from France on Air Force Day

 The Hindus of Pakistan refrained from saying anything
 The Christian community kept an open view on the citizenship law
 The Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) in India has become law after it has been approved by the President
 iske tahat 2015 se pehle se bharat main rah rahe duusare deshon se aae alpsankhyakon ko bhartiya naagarikta mil jaaegi
 These minorities include Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi
 muslimon ko isamen shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Imran Khan said that the anti-muslim agenda has already criticized Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan for this development of India
 imran ne CAB ko narendra modi sarkaar kaa muslim virdohi agenda bataaya tha
 On one hand, the Pakistan government is clearly describing India's decision as anti-muslim, while the minorities living in Pakistan have reacted cautiously to this decision
 pakistan main rahane vaale hindu CAB ke prabhaavon ko lekar ashankit dikhe, isliye unhone apana najariya bataane se inkaar kiya
 However, the Christian community living in Pakistan spoke openly on this
 ‘india today’ ne lahore main isai samudaay ke pramukh sadsy or pakistan main alpsankhyakon ke adhikaron kii awaz uthaane vaale peter jaikab se unki raay jaani
 Jacob said, 'countries (india and Pakistan) came into existence like twins
 ek rota he to doosraa bhi rota he
 Policies adopted in India and Pakistan have a ping pong effect
 aise main ek desh kii niti kaa duusare par prabhaav padataa he
 At the same time, a series of reactions starts which provoke people's behavior
 ye avaanchit he
 He said, it is very difficult to believe that Hindus living in Pakistan will try to go there to settle in India
 wo 1947 main yahaan se nahin gaye
 Did not go after that
 jo log bharat basane gaye, unhone bhi laut kar bataaya ki vahaan kisi mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 How he was suspected to be a Pakistani agent
 ’pakistan ke punjab praant main alpsankhyak adhikaron ke mantri ejaj alam augustin ne kaha ki bharat pakistan main alpsankhyakon kii kathith traasad sthit kii baat karata he lekin apane hi desh main alpsankhyakon ke adhikaron kii raksha karne main naakaam rahaa he
 Is the law made by targeting Pakistan? The minister also said that 'this is part of India's agenda against Pakistan
 ye bill pakistan ko target karke laayaa gaya he, kyonki afghanistan or bangladesh kaa jhukaav pehle se hi bharat kii taraf he
 i believe that forced conversion is the issue in Pakistan
 lekin sthiti itani kharaab nahin he jaisi ki bataai jaati he
 'citizenship Amendment Law based on discrimination, Minister Augustine said,' Citizenship Amendment Act is clearly discriminatory, it gives place to all minorities but willfully ignores the largest minority community
 duusari taraf pakistan main aisa koi kanoon nahin he jo apane alpsankhyakon main bhed karata ho
 "why not equal rights for all minorities? From the Christian community itself, Dr
 Majod Abel agreed that this would bring relief and happiness to the minorities from outside India, but discrimination is not acceptable
 dow abel ne kaha, “haa, main samajhataa hum ki alpsankhyakon ke liye ye acchhee baat he
 But why discrimination? If you discriminate, you break the same rule that you want to show yourself as champion
 main nahin samajhataa ki ye vin vin vaali sthiti he
 If you are creating a rule for minorities, then it should be for all minorities
 jinhen laabh milegaa unke liye main khush hum
 But i stand by those who have been isolated
 ”chrishchiyan salveshan army ke major yaqub sardaar ne kaha ki kisi bhi desh main alpsankhyakon ko baraabar adhikaar die jate hai or samuchit vyavhaar kiya jaataa he to naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon acchhee baat he, lekin ise sabhi alpsankhkon par lagu kiya janaa chahie
 Sardar said, 'the word minority should be removed from all countries
 aise har kisi shaks ko sambandhit desh ke naagarik ke naate vaise hi barabari ke adhikaar, prem or suraksha di jaani chahie jaise desh ke or nagarikon ko die jate hai

 Regarding the reasons behind undermining the bsp's vote, Yadav says, "professional opinion polls generally undermine the BSP because of the strong, affluent and upper castes of the society in selecting the respondents in the survey

 This book shows that in the 1960s, Joshi started writing three novels, but none could be completed, Joshi ji had a very good understanding of the future, he had long ago said that in the coming times Technology will liberate Hindi from the clutches of thought
 aaj manohar shyaam joshi kii jayanti par sahitya ajtak par padhie prabhaat ranjan kii pustak 'paaltu bohemianh manohar shyaam joshi ek yaad' kaa ek anshah***jab ve lakhanu uniwarsity main padhate the or vahaan ke habibulla hostal main rahete the to amritlal nagar ke yahan jane lage
 Nagar ji used to have his compositions spoken and written
 un dinon nagar ji 'buund or samudr' upanyaas likh rahe the or uske kuch panne unhone bhi likhe the
 Incidentally, Joshi also used to write and write
 unhone ek yuvak ko typing ke liye baqayada naukari par rakhaa tha
 The man named Shambhudatti Sati came to work for him in the 90s
 un dinon joshi ji 'humraahi' dharawahik likh rahe the
 From then till the last film 'hey Ram', he kept typing for him
 joshi ji ne apane ek intervyuu main is baat kaa zikr bhi kiya he ki 1966 main jab ve ‘saptahik hindustan' ke sampadak bane tab unako baqayada ek typist sahaayak ke rup main mila or unke lekhan main gati ai
 Otherwise, in the matter of writing by hand, he was so cautious that like most Kahil writers in Hindi, he continued to write poetry
 bolkar likhavane kii baat chal rahi he to lage haath yah bataanaa bhi mujhe jaruri lagata he ki vah computer par likhane kaa jamaana nahin tha
 Most writers used to write by hand
 mohan rakesh ke bare main maine padhaa tha ki 60 ke dashak main ve tiperiter par likhaa karte the or jahaan bhi jate, apana vah tiperiter saath lekar jate the
 When i started working with Ashok Vajpayee in the late 90s, i saw that he too used to write on typewriters every morning
 un dinon hindi ke bahut kam lekhak khud tiperiter par likhte the
 This was the season of those days
 joshi ji ke samakaleen lekhak kamaleshwar ji filmon, tivi, sahitya-har madhyam main behad safal lekhak rahe lekin ve haath se hi likhte the
 i remember that he used to write with a bandage tied in his fingers
 jis din maine pehali baar unako ungali main pattee baandhakar likhte hue dekha to main bahut chakit hua or maine unase kaha, 'sar, aap kisi typist ko rakhkar bolkar kyon nahin likhavate? joshi ji to bolkar hi likhavate hai
 While giving up cigarette smoke in Dunhill, Kamleshwar Ji said, 'the Hindi writer has to struggle a lot
 haath se likhane main sangharsh kaa vah bhav bana rahata he
 You know, Prabhat, the day i stop writing by hand, i will not be able to write
 hindi kaa lekhak 'kalam kaa majdoor' hi hota he or use lekhan kaa raja banane kaa prayaas nahin karnaa chahie
 'I was in a mood to argue with him
 maine kaha, 'sar, manohar shyaam joshi ji bolkar likhte hai
 'hearing something they were serious and then said,' Look, every writer has his own style, his own thought process
 jaise agar main bolkar likhavane lagunga to meri bhashaa, mere samvaad sab vishrunkhal ho jaaenge
 The way i write today, i myself feel as if a mystery is being revealed on the pages in front of me! This revelation through letters, words is the real pleasure of writing for me
 isi kaaran se chaahe main film likhuun, serials likhuun yaa kahani-upanyaas, lekhan mujhe anandadaayak lagata he
 'after that he stopped for a while and said, tell me one thing, Joshi's first novel' kuru-kuru Swaha '
 
 
 ' or 'kasap' bahut sugathit he
 Both of them were written by hand
 ' kehane ke baad ve phir se likhane main lag gaye
 Well, it seems to me that Kamleshwar ji's handwriting was so beautiful that it may not have happened, they have been writing in the same fascination by hand! Now the subject is going to write by hand versus typing the typist, then i remember another story 
 ye un dinon kii baat he jab main mahatma gandhi antarrashtriya vishvavidhyalay kii patrika 'bahuvachan' kaa sampaadan kar rahaa tha
 Piyush Daiya, the first editor of that magazine, suddenly quit editing the magazine
 tab main vishvavidhyalay kii angreji patrika 'hindi' main sahaayak sampadak tha
 The university's name at that time was due to the publication of the magazine 'plural'
 chunki us daur main vishvavidhyalay nirmaan-kaal se guzar rahaa tha, isliye vahaan prakaashan kaa kaam hi adhik hota tha
 Suddenly, one day Ashok Vajpayee called me and said, 'until a new editor is found, you only take out one of its numbers
 'yah sunate hi maine tay kar liya ki us ek ank ke madhyam se mujhe aisa prabhaav chhodana he ki aage ankon ke sampadan kaa bhaar bhi mujhe hi mil jaae
 i first went to Joshi's house to inform him
 ve bahut khush hue
 He said, 'ashok wants to do a very good job, but the people of Bhopal around him are such that you remain editor among them, it will be nothing short of amazing
 lekin koshish puri karnaa
 "I asked what you will give, then said 'just recently' Raghuveer Sahay Rachnavali 'has been published
 main vahi pard rahaa tha
 Rachnavali editor Suresh Sharma had requested that i write a review
 "maine kaha, 'samiksha? matlab, aap yah kah rahe hai ki aap mere sampaadan main nikalne vaale pehle ank ke liye ek kitaab kii samiksha likhenge? main to soch rahaa tha ki aap kuch aisa likhen jo yaadgaar bane or meri naukari bhi batch jaae
 In response, he again said, 'I write something under the same composition
 ''raghuveer sahay rachanawali ke bahaane samaran' sheershak se jab unhone raghuveer sahay par likhnaa shuru kiya to agle teen ankon tak uskaa prakaashan hua
 It is probably the largest Hindi review, which was later published by the bookseller
 khayr, phir ek din main krishna baldev vaid ke yahan unase milane gaya
 Incidentally, Joshi ji, among his contemporary writers, the author who used to eat the most fear of being educated, was Vaid Saheb
 to maine vaid sahab se poocha 'sar, joshi ji jo raghuveer sahay par likh rahe hai, vah aapako kaisaa lag rahaa he?"jawaab main vaid sahab ne hanste hue kaha, 'joshi bolkar likhvata he na!'***pustakapaltu bohemian, manohar shyaam joshi ek yadalekhakarprabhat ranjanvidhahsansmaranprakashakahrajakmal prakashankimat:125 / - rupye, paperbakaprishth sankhyah136 Anna Hazare, who was in the Lokpal Bill drafting committee, offered to the government to hold a referendum in this regard if it considers the issues raised by them to be unfair
 sanyukt samiti main shaamil varisht adhivaktaa prashanth bhushan ne chal rahe hajaare ke anshan ke dauraan kaha ki agar sarkaar lokapal ke sambandh main hamaare uthaae vishyon ko anuchit maanati he to vah apane vidheyak or hamaare vidheyak par janamat sangrah kara sakati he
 It will be clear that the issues raised are legitimate
 ’’unhone kaha ki jab sanyukt masauda samiti bani thi to uskaa makasad yah tha ki sarkaar ke saath hi samaaj ke paksh kii bhi raay le kar vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar kiya jayega
 But now it appears that the government wants to draft the Lokpal Bill on its own, in which the mps, mps conduct, Prime Minister and Judiciary will not be kept under the purview of the proposed Lokpal
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar ne yah daleel di he ki ramlila maidan se anshankariyon ko isliye uthaanaa padaa kyonki ve sarkaar ke saath hue samjhaute se mukar rahe the
 Even if this argument is accepted that Baba Ramdev was disobeying his promise, is it not right for every citizen to hold a peaceful protest
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne bhi apane vibhinn faislon main kaha he ki janata ko shantipurna tareeke se ekatrit ho kar pradarshan karne se nahin roka janaa chahie
 Before him, former Law Minister Shanti Bhushan said that force comes in the voice of the public only when it performs peacefully
 samvidhan hamen shantipurna tareeke se ikattha ho kar pradarshan karne kaa adhikaar detaa he
 He said that the Lokpal Bill is the first fight

 Finally, after two months of controversy, Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel resigned from his post with immediate effect
 patel ne kaha he ki vah nijee kaarnon se istipha de rahe hai
 The resignation given with immediate effect means that the coordination between the RBI and the central government is now completely shattered and it was impossible for Patel to continue in this post
 RBI ke ‘rigerv’ par thi sarkaar kii najar?haal hi main kendriya bank governor or kendra sarkaar main swaittata ko lekar vivaad khadaa hua tha
 The dispute was about the security deposit lying in the RBI treasury by the central government
 report ke mutabik kendra sarkaar kendriya rigerv se adhik ansh kii maang kar rahaa tha
 However, after this dispute, the central government had given a statement that there is no dispute about autonomy between it and the RBI
 export samiti banane par nahin bani sahmati?kendriya rigerv bank or kendra sarkaar ke bich khinchataan beete kai maheenon se jari thi
 In order to resolve these disputes, the RBI board, during a marathon meeting on 19 November, took several important decisions to reconcile the two central government and the central bank
 isamen arabiai or kendra sarkaar ko milakar ek export samiti gathit kerani thi
 This committee was supposed to review the disputes between the RBI and the central government and work on their resolution
 vahiin is samiti ko gathit karne main kendriya bank ke saath-saath kendra sarkaar ko bhi ahm kirdaar diya gaya tha
 It is evident from Urjit Patel's resignation that both the RBI and the Central Government have not been able to do the work of setting up this committee
 urjit patel par daaromadar, rbi-sarkaar main hogi jang yaa jari rahegi shanti?kitna khatarnaak ho gaya rbi-sarkaar kaa rishta?rbi or kendra sarkaar ke bich kai samvedansheel maamalon main vivaad kii sthiti kaa khulaasa oktober ke ant main tab hua jab RBI ke dipti governor viral acharya ne daawa kiya ki RBI ke kaamkaaj main dakhal dene se desh ke liye khatarnaak sthiti paidaa ho sakati he
 After Acharya's statement, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley accused the RBI that from 2008 to 2014, the central bank ignored the task of disbursing loans and posed a serious NPA problem to the country
 enbiensi par sarkaar or RBI aamane-saamne?banking sector main sudhaar ke liye RBI ne haal main kai kade kadam uthaae the
 Among these, the RBI had imposed strict restrictions to fix bad loans of non-banking financial companies (nbfcs) in the country due to the problem of bad loans in the banking sector
 in enbiensi ke jariye desh main laghu, madhyam or chote kaarobaar samet aam aadmi ko nayaa karj dene kaa kaam kiya jaataa he
 nbfcs are going through a severe cash crisis due to rbi's strictness

 Suspense on Section 7 of the RBI Act? In the ongoing dispute between the Central Government and the RBI, the use of Section 7 of the RBI Act was also revealed
 is section ke tahat kendra sarkaar janhit main ahm muddon par arabiai ko farmaan dene kaa kaam kar sakati he
 Significantly, in the midst of this controversy, the Central Government had said to use section 7 for the first time
 haalanki kendra sarkaar ne maamle main safai dete hue kaha tha ki usne is section kaa istemaal nahin kiya he
 At the same time, Finance Minister Jaitley said that the RBI Act says that the central government works for giving advice in serious matters and claimed that the central government only gives advice under this provision

 The Lok Sabha election results have cast the SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 soobe main jaateey ganit ke sahare narendra modi ke vijay rath ko rokane kaa dambh bharne vaale akhilesh-mayawati puri tarah fail ho gaye
 Out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, the SP-BSP alliance was reduced to 15 seats
 jabaki gathbandhan ke pratyaashiyon ko jitaane ke liye akhilesh yadav or mayawati ne jamkar pasinaa bahaya
 However, in the midst of this intense Modi wave, mayawati-akhilesh's Deoband rally worked and the BSP managed to win the surrounding seats
 mayawati-akhilesh yadav ne soobe main loksabhaa chunaav prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat 7 april ko saharanpur jile ke devband se kii thi
 There were many reasons behind starting the campaign from here
 inamen ek yogi sarkaar ke aane ke baad hi saharanpur ke shabbirpur main dalit-rajput ke bich jaateey sangharsh hua tha, jiske chalate mayawati ne rajyasabha se istipha de diya tha
 For this reason Mayawati made her election debut from Saharanpur and this seat was also very favorable for the alliance in terms of dalit-muslim equation
 iske alaava ganna kisaanon kii naaraazgi ko hawa dekar kisaan maton ke dhruvikaran kii ranneeti bhi thi
 The BSP has also been successful in this
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey ko dekhen to congress ummidavaar imran masood ko do lakh vot milane ke baad bhi basapa ke haji fajalurrahman jeetne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 mayawati-akhilesh Yadav joint rally in Deoband was held in Bijnor, Kairana, Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat areas along with Saharanpur
 is raily main rashtriya lokdal ke adhyaksh choudhary ajit singh ne bhi sambodhit kiya tha
 The alliance may not have performed as expected throughout the state, but as a result, the BSP managed to win the Saharanpur seat as well as the Bijnor and Nagina Lok Sabha seats
 iske baad akhilesh-mayawati kii sanyukt raily kaa siyaasi phayda rampur kii raily se gathbandhan ko hua
 This seat has also been favorable to the dalit-muslim equation
 saharanpur raily kaa jahaan bijepi ko phayda rahaa to rampur kii raily se sapa aasapaas kii siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 Of the five seats the SP has got in the state, three are from this region
 rampur, sanbhal or muradabad seat par sapa ko jeet mili he
 These three seats were fielded by Akhilesh Yadav, the candidate of choice of Azam Khan
 devband or rampur se chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karne ke peeche muslim maton ko apni taraf khinchne kii koshish bhi vajah thi
 The SP-BSP has been successful in this plan
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki kai anya siten bhi jeetne main kaamyaab hui jahaan muslim matadaata acchhee taadaad main hai
 Ghazipur, Ghosi, Ambedkaranagar, Shravasti, Lalganj and Azamgarh in eastern Uttar Pradesh are similar seats where the yadav-muslim-dalit alliance managed to win
 chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan mayawati ne muslim matadaataaon se gathbandhan ke paksh main matdaan kii apil khulkar kar di thi, jis par vivaad bhi hua tha
 This alliance card was successful in mobilizing Muslim voters in its favor

 The most mysterious and controversial trial ever awaited justice: the double murder of Noida on 16 May 2008

 ''koi pratyaksh sakshya nahinjajon ne apane faisle main likhaa he, ''yah aise asaamaanya maamalon main ek he'' jahaan koi bhi pratyaksh sakshya record par nahin he
 The question arises as to what the trial judge took into account in 2013? Here are the main points: Who were the people who were last seen with the deceased on the night of 15–16 May 2008? Talwar couple unki manshaa kya thi? ''achaanak kaa teevr uksaava'' (aarushi or hemraj ko aapattijanak sthiti main dekhakar)
 What was the chance of murder? Talwar couple's house
 hatyare bahari log kyon nahin ho sakate? bahari aadmi ke paas jurm karne ke liye itnaa vakt nahin hota
 Justice Narayan and Justice Mishra explained, "the respected trial judge had made the assumption
 unhone atikatu vivek se prerit ek alag kahani suna di
 "why can't there be outsiders in the assassination?" In response to this, the "most convincing accusation by CBI" was that Talwar's flat was 'sealed from the inside' on the morning of 16 May (so no outsider could have entered inside a night before), the judges said Talwar's domestic maid a close inspection of Bharti Mandal's testimony fired him
 nyaayadhishon ne faisle main kaha, ''bharti mandal kii gavaahi is baat ko sabit karne main puri tarah aparyaapt thi ki 16 may kii subah chah baje ke aasapaas talwaar kaa makaan bheetar se band tha
 "talwar's apartment had three doors: an outer door with an iron mesh, a middle door that was also made of iron mesh and the inner door was wooden
 jajon kaa kahana he ki bharti kaa sakshya yah kahin se nahin dikhaata ki bahari darwaja bheetar se band tha
 Yes, initially she could not open the door
 noopur ne jab lakdi kaa darwaja kholaa, to jaisaa ki sakshya dikhaate hai, unhone paaya ki bich vaala darwaja baahar se band tha (noopur ne bharti se kaha tha, ''ho saktaa he hemraj baahar se band kar ke madar deyari se doodh laane gaya ho'')
 In her testimony, Bharti says that the second time she opened the outer door
 bahari darwaja aasaani se nahin khulata tha
 This was normal
 ek se zyada gavaah ne kaha ki vah akasar jam ho jaataa tha
 The statement of Rajesh's driver Umesh Sharma was, "this door opens with a jerk and a voice
" '' ilaake main kapade istari karne vaali shashi devi kaa kahana tha, ''bahari darwaja chipka rahata tha
 The glut of flaws was alleged by the Talwars that the Talwar couple had tampered with the chance

 There was no blood on the Talwar couple's clothes and their room was cleaned just after Aarushi's corpse was taken to the funeral

 The CBI alleged that Rajesh had removed the door of an outside iron grill and painted the apartment after a year and a half to erase solid evidence

 In the judgment of Hiccourt messing with evidence, it has also come to light that the investigating agencies have tampered with the evidence

 Mahapatra had also reported that the DNA profile found on a cover of the pillow (recovered from Hemraj's room but seized from Aarushi's room) matched the thread and claw marks of the yarn

 Records also show that bloody footprints have also been found near Hemraj's corpse, which does not match the Talwar couple

 Justifying the verdict, Justices Narayan and Mishra named Kaul at least 31 times: to spread speculation about the murder tools of proof (golf clubs and medical knives), to give the postmortem report a new twist and a new 'sensational' angle
 For (aarushi's 'taken cunt' and Hemraj's 'swollen genitals'), to pressure, influence and manipulate scientists and doctors (in DNA reports Pie mistakes suggest)

 From the early days of his career, Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Khan were in discussion about their affairs

 'anna kii charchaa karte hue kejariwal ne kaha, 'anna raajnneeti ko keechad kehete the, maine anna ko samajhaayaa ki is keechad ko saaf karne ke liye isamen ghusna hi hoga
 Speaking on the current political situation, he said that education is bad because politics is bad, the road is bad because politics is bad
 ham gandi raajnneeti ko saaf karne nikle hai
 He said that the increased hopes are afraid

 But i have met many officers
 saare afasar bhrasht nahin hai or kuch bhrasht logon ko chhod den to sabhi desh seva karnaa chaahate hai
 Appealing to his legislators, ministers and activists, Kejriwal said, 'I want to tell my mlas and ministers that there should never be pride in our mind
 kabhi ghamand na karnaa doston
 Never let us become proud and another party has to come to break our pride
 'kaaryakartaaon se bhi apil he ki wo pehle kii tarah hi janata kii seva main lage rahen or sabase vinamrata se milen
 Service is to be kept on top

 'apni sarkaar kii praathamiktaaon kii ore ishaara karte hue kejariwal ne logon se kaha, 'abhi tak sarkari daftaron main bina rishwat die kaam nahin hota tha

 In Aaj Tak's special program 'sidhi Baat', Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has attacked the Congress party in a befitting manner
 unhone congress par court ke raste desh kii raajnneeti chalaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Also referring to the Judge Loya case, he said that those who are continuously losing in the elections, now they want to run the politics of the country through the court, but we will not let this happen
 ravishankar prasad ne jaj loya kii maut se jude maamle main supreme court main daayar janhit yachika ko congress hit or bijepi kii ahit vaali yachika bataaya he
 He said that the death of the judge was natural and the Congress remained silent for 3 years after the death but then it was deliberately made an issue based on a fake article published in Caravan magazine
 kanoon mantri ne kaha ki yachika main kaha gaya ki amit shah ke niyantran main supreme court he, aisi tippanee court ke saamne karnaa kya uchit he
 He said that the Supreme Court while replying to this petition has said that PIL was filed to defame the court in a planned manner
 lekin hamaari sarkaar nishpaksh auraswatantra nyaay palikake liye patibaddh he
 Ravi Shankar said that he is a minister in the government, from PM Narendra Modi to people like Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, who have been jailed during the Emergency for media, court and civil liberties
 apatkaal lagane vaali congress hamase sawaal puch rahi he
 He said that the Modi government has made the highest number of appointments in the judiciary
 kanoon mantri ne kaha ki congress party baar-baar chunaav main harati he
 The leaders who lost the elections want to run the country by filing a sponsored PIL and this will not be accepted under any circumstances
 unhone kaha ki janata ne vot dekar hamen sarkaar chalaane kaa adhikaar diya he
 Shweta Singh's full conversation with Ravi Shankar Prasad in 'sidhi Baat' can be seen at 8 pm this Sunday
 ne ta sirf paanch saal main kharbapati kaise ho jate hai? pichley maah, jab is sawaal ke saath supreme court ne sarkaar se kareeb 289 saansadon-vidhayakon kii is udhyamita kaa rahasy poocha tha to bahut logon kii ukvamid jaagi ki ab to 2014 ke chunavi vaade yaad aa hi jaaenge jin main mutthiyaan laharaate raajnneeti ko saaf karne kaa sankalp kiya gaya tha
 The Prime Minister had asked all mps-mlas to give information about their bank accounts to the party during demonetisation last year
 jaankaree jarur ai hogi lekin ghanton line main lagane vaali janata ko yah pataa nahin chalaa ki notebandi ke dauraan unke mananeey numaayindon ke bank khaaton main kya ho rahaa tha? bataate chalem ki saal bitne ko he lekin beete saptaah tak pradhanmantri kii website par 92 main keval 29 mantriyon kii sampatti ke byore uplabdh the
 Corruption and electronics have a unique resemblance
 donon jitne naino yani sookshm hote jate hai, unki takat utani zyada badhati jaati he or raajnneeti isamen duubakar or ujali (jyon jyon boode shyaam rang, tyon tyon ujwal hoy) hoti jaati he
 Increasing the power of corruption and brightening it means becoming institutionalized
 bhrashtachar kii badhati sookshmata puri duniya main sabase badi chunauti he, ladaai isliye kathin hoti ja rahi he ki jab tak log bhrashtachar ko samajhakar or jaagruk hokar yaa iske viruddh lamaband ho pate hai, tab tak yah sansthagat ho jaataa he
 As soon as institutionalized, corruption becomes a place of crime, convenience, habit, helplessness, tradition and sometimes even rules
 aarthik faislon main to vibhaajak rekhaaen itani dhundhlee hai ki pratyaksh taur par saaf-suthere dikhne vaale nitigat faislon main maheen vyapak bhrashtachar chipa hota he
 The complex and institutionalized corruption can be understood by some examples: 1
 rajnatik dalon ko milane vaala chanda loktantr main bhrashtachar kii sabase badi sanstha he
 All parties started accepting it as a compulsion, efforts to make it transparent even if it is changed, are marginalized
 chande sansthagat ho gaye
 The Election Commission and the courts too could not do much to correct it
 hamen yah maaloom he ki chandon ke badale satta ke phaaydon main hissedari hoti he lekin yah bhrashtachar sookshm or 'nitisangat' he
 We have to assume that every new government that comes to power will give opportunities to its favorite businessmen
 vikaas kii yah keemat hamen bhugatni padegi
 2
 rajaneta yaa adhikari sarkaar main padon or rasookh kaa phayda uthaa sakate hai
 mp-mlas declare assets but not their business or financial contacts
 2015 main tambaakoo utpaadon par chetavanee kaa faisla karne vaali samiti main bidi udyog se jude do saansad the
 The rules in this matter regarding mps, mlas and Ministers are so incomplete that this corruption has become institutionalized in a way
 jab hamen apane numaayindon ke bare main hi jaankaree nahin milti to unke pariwaron ke bare main koun poochhega? association of democratic ritis kii yachika par desh kii sarvocch adaalat kaa achraj sahi tha ki keval paanch saal main kuch saansadon kii sampatti 500 fisadi kaise bad sakati he
 3
 bainkon se companiyon ko karj, sarkaron se udyogon ko jameen, khadaan, spectrum aavanton jahiraa taur par saaf-suthere aarthik vyavhaar hai lekin jaraa yah udhaaharan dekhie ki companiyon ne sarkaar se spectrum kharida, iske liye bainko se karj le liya gaya lekin ghaataa hone par fees kii maafee, bank karj ko taalane kaa package, kya yah sab kuch saaf-suthra he? bainkon ke bakaayaa karj kii vajahen aarthik vifaltaaen hi nahin hai
 This meticulous institutional corruption is difficult to quantify on a large scale
 bhrashtachar ke maamle main ham aksar yah maan lete hai ki sheersh par baithe ek-do saaf suthere log puri vyavastha main swatchta kaa chamatkaar kar denge
 But this corruption is not personal at all
 rajnatik ucch padon par bhrashtachar ab avasaron kii pechida bandarbaant kaa he, anya phaayde to adrishy hai
 Now personal conflicts over corruption do not go far
 kai baar saaf-suthere netritv bhi apane peeche bhayanak kaalikh chhod jate hai
 Successes against institutional corruption at high positions have always been achieved only with the help of institutions (law, courts, auditors)
 kya pichley teen saal main bharat main bhrashtachar se ladgaye vaali sansthaaen majboot or viksit hui hai? nahin to phir jab tak band he tab tak anand he, jab khulegaa tab khilegaa

 hafiz kii rihaai ne pakistan par uthaae sawaalhafiz kii rihaai ke baad bharat or america sahit antarrashtriya manchon se aatankwaad ke khilaaf pakistan ke laaparvaah ravaiye ko lekar aagaah kiya gaya
 But the question is, how did this become possible? After all, how did Hafiz get independence despite so much evidence? After all how did Pakistan ignore the objections of India, America and even the United Nations? After all, the Government of Pakistan and the system that created the chakravyuh to bring out Hafiz? Answer to the questions in the High Court hearing
 a look at the recent hearing in the Lahore High Court regarding Hafiz to know the answers to these questions
 It is necessary to insert
 lahore hoicourt ne kaha tha ki hafiz ke khilaaf yadi saboot pesh nahin kiye gaye, to use aaazaad kar diya jayega
 The court also reprimanded the Pak government in this case
 court ne pakistan ke grih sachiv ko hafiz ke khilaaf sabooton ke saath pesh hone ko kaha
 But neither the Home Secretary nor the evidence came
 balki chote afasaron ne adaalat main nai taarikh le lee
 The Lahore High Court expressed unhappiness over this and said that this is a government attempt to postpone the case
 pakistan kii aatankiyon se mileebhagrasal main ye pakistan ke system kii aatankiyon se wo mileebhagat he, jisaki badaulat wo saalon se puri duniya kii ankhon main dhul jhonkta rahaa he
 Whenever pressure is made to take action against terrorism from international forums, Pakistan starts plays like banning them, detaining them
 lekin hakeekat yahi he ki pakistani sarkaar kii saraparasti main pal rahe ye aatankwaadi ab itane taqatvar ho chuke hai ki inke khilaaf sachmuch karrwai karne main sarkaar ke haath-paanv kaanpate hai
 These terrorists are spreading terrorist messages from open forums, and the Government of Pakistan has blindfolded
 inhen main se ek he hafiz said kaa sipahasaalar abdul rahamaan makki
 Makki has been openly threatening the government of Pakistan for detaining Hafiz Saeed
 vahiin duusari taraf vahaan system in aatankwaadiyon ko awami rahanuma banane kii koshishon main juta hua he
 The truth is that the government of Pakistan is engaged in a conspiracy to bring these terrorists into politics and hand over the command of the country to the terrorists
 pakistani army ke pravaktaa tak yah kubul kar chuke hai ki pakistani sarkaar kaa inatankwaadiyon par koi jor nahinrah gaya he
 Not only this, even Pakistan Foreign Minister Khwaja Asif has agreed that Pakistan's system is playing friendly match among the terrorists
 vastav main yahi pakistan kii asli fitrat he
 At the same time, it is our fault that every time we take hope from Pakistan and also cheat

 phir bhi, us samay hamen jo khamiyaan dekhne ko milin, unhen dekh man kharaab ho jaataa he
 The race for degrees, studying Rattamar and spewing out the minds without a mind, many times with the help of imitation, have all become the curse of our higher education system
 principal shikshak unionon ke aage bhigi billi bane rahete hai or chaatro ko koi parvaah nahin hoti ki lekturer class le rahe hai yaa nahin
 Political interference in the states is also terrible and it is also ruining reputed institutions full of resources

 In this backdrop, many questions arise regarding the utility of the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) implemented by the Ministry of Human Resource Development in September 2015
 meri pakki raay he ki sansthaanon ke akalan or moolyankan main purvagrahon ko dur karne ke liye technology kaa istemaal hi hona chahie
 But there should have been someone to check the results of such a large number of institutions and tell them the results? But there are many amazing things happening in India
 teen hi saal main vishvavidhyalayon or collejon, donon kii grading kii prakriya jaden jamaa chuki he
 Institutions in NIRF are ranked on five broad scales
 ye paimaane hai adhyaapan, adhyayan tathaa suvidhaayen, anusandhan tathaa profeshnal tareeke, graduate nattejey, dayera, or avadharana
 Although many institutes did not consider it necessary to join, but the technology based rankings of the top 100 colleges with higher education general, engineering, management and pharmacy courses are available as soon as you press the button
 yah ranking aakhir karti kya he
 NIRF has ranked Miranda House College of Delhi University at number one in the entire country for two consecutive years
 maine uski principal pratibha jolly se poocha ki miranda house kii safalataa kaa aadhaar kya he?miranda house kii purv chaatra hone ke naate lagbhag 55 saal se maine kabhi awwal rahane vaale is college ko logon kii dharna or chaatro kii pasand donon hi maamalon main apni chamak khokar phisalte dekha he
 But in the last ten years i have also seen that the college has grabbed every opportunity to regain its lost reputation

 One thing about Chauhan is significant
 unhone kaha, ''ucch shiksha ke liye baahar jane vaale chaatro kii sankchaya pehle ke kisi bhi samay kii tulana main zyada he
 a large number of Indian students are getting easy admission to many well-known universities in Britain, America, and for some time in many universities in Europe, provided these students can afford both hefty tuition fees and huge living expenses
 maa-baap bhi ucch shiksha ke liye motaa kharch uthaane ko taiyaar hai, jise ve apane bachche ke bhavishya ke liye ek nivesh ke taur par dekhte hai
 It is estimated that about Rs 30,000 crore annually
 videshi shiksha par kharch kiye jate hai
 This raises the question whether we should not provide a little more information to Indian parents and children, so that they do not indulge in such a huge expense to send children for education abroad? Shouldn't certification be given at least on some rough standards before being granted? The certification process in India becomes quite lengthy
 saal 1994 main shuru kii gai pramann kii prakriya kaa makasad pehle sansthaanon ke liye sirf eneesi kii funding hasil karne kaa rahata tha
 The process of obtaining data from this website is slow and frustrating

 Certification should be made mandatory, not just the evaluation of ABC before ranking

 Ashoka University may not have participated in this process but it has earned a name in a relatively short period of time

 But no, he retained the rapist Aloknath as part of the film

 In such a situation, if Ajay Devgan and the makers wanted, he could quietly replace Aloknath
 unke seens ko rishute kar sakate the
 Ajay Devgan had condemned such incidents by tweeting after the Meethu campaign intensified
 unhone likhaa tha- # metoo ke tahat jo bhi sunne ko mil rahaa he usase ve pareshaan hai

 unhone kaha ki masjid kaa nirmaan mandir ke bhagnavsheshon par babar ke aadesh par kiya gaya tha
 The ruins of the temple had been lying in the state for a long time
 apane avlokan main nyaayadhish ne kaha ki masjid ke nirmaan se kaaphi samay pehle hinduon kaa maananaa tha ki vivaadit kshetra ke behad thode se hisse main bhagwaan ram kii janmasthali thi
 However, this recognition is not linked to any specific small area within the larger area at the disputed site
 unhone kaha ki 1855 se kaaphi pehle ram chabutara or sita rasoi astitv main aa gai thi or hindu pratimaaon kii puja kar rahe the
 It was quite amazing and absolutely unmatched that there were Hindu shrines inside the boundary wall of the mosque and inside the premises where the worship was being done, on the other hand Muslims were offering prayers in the mosque
 nyaayamurti khan ne kaha ki donon paksh is baat ko sabit karne main vifal rahe hai ki unke malikana haq kii shuruuaat kab se hui or isliye sakshya adhinium kii dhara 110 ke anusaar donon pakshon ko sanyukt kabje ke aadhaar par sanyukt maalik tehraaya jaataa he
 Justice Khan said that a few decades before the year 1949, Hindus began to consider the site under the middle dome of the mosque (where the temporary temple currently stands) to be the exact birthplace of Lord Rama
 pehali baar 23 disambar 1949 ke tadake madhya gumbad ke neeche pratimaa rakhi gai
 In his order, the judge said that all three parties - Hindus, Muslims and Nirmohi Arena - are declared joint owners of the disputed premises and each will have a share of one-third of each to use and manage the worship
 haalanki, unhone saaf kar diya ki antim nirnay main madhya gumbad ke neeche vaala hissaa, jahaan pilhal pratimaa rakhi hui he use hinduon ko aavantit kar diya jayega
 The judge directed that the Nirmohi Akhara be allocated a portion with Ram Chabutara and Sita Rasoi
 unhone spasht kiya ki agar bhoomi kaa aavanton karne ke dauraan thodaa bahut maamuli samaayojan kiya jaataa he to prabhavit paksh ko centre sarkaar dwaara paas main adhigrahit kii gai bhoomi main se kuch hissaa dekar isaki bharpai kii jaani chahie
 He gave the parties three months to file their representations for the actual partition
 unhone kaha ki teen maheene kii avadhi ke liye yathasthiti bani rahegi

 nitish kataara hatyakand maamle main neelam kataara ne supreme court ke faisle kaa swaagat kiya
 Neelam Katara described the verdict on Monday as her 'biggest win' in the case
 unhone doshiyon ko mili 25 saal karawas kii sajaa ko nyaaysangat qaraar diya
 Neelam Kataraane, who fought a long and arduous battle to get justice for her son, said she was satisfied that the murderers of her son were sentenced to more years by the court than the usual 14-year sentence
 
 neelam ne sajaa kii avadhi par santushti jataate hue kaha ki, 'doshiyon ko 25 saal kii sajaa die jane se main khush hum
 The High Court did not consider it a case of common murder
 'neelam ne aage kaha ki hoicourt ne ise honor kiling kaa maamla qaraar diya tha, jise kuch amir or taqatvar logon ne anjaam diya tha
 He said, it was for this reason that the court sentenced the culprits to 30 years instead of 14 years
 neelam ne aage kaha ki vikaas yadav or vishaal yadav ko 25 saal se pehle raahat nahin milegi or yah meri sabase badi jeet he
 While welcoming the court's decision, he said that it is a big deal for the youth of the country too, because the court has taken a clear stand in this matter

 In fact, a 7-year-old girl had filed a public interest litigation in the High Court to stop the park in front of her house from being dismantled and build a community center
 court ne park main hui khudaai or nirmaan kaary ko hataakar dobaaraa park ke restoration ke liye 4 hafte kaa vakt didie ko diya he
 Hearing this petition, the High Court has issued notices to LG, DDA and MCD
 bataa den ki isi saal agast main lagaai gai is janhit yachika par sunwaayee karte hue hycourt ne poocha ki jab 100 meter kii duuri par pehle hi community centre he to phir duusare kii kya jarurat he?dilli hoicourt ke is rukh ke baad shuukravaar ko hui sunwaayee main didie ne hoicourt ko bataaya he ki ab wo is park main community centre nahin banaaenge, balki community centre kisi duusari jagah banaaya jayega
 Earlier, the court had asked whether the NOC was taken from the common people to build this community center? The High Court had stayed any construction in the park during the hearing of the petition
 bataa den ki 7 saal kii navya ne hoicourt main lagaai yachika main kaha tha ki hamen ped lagane ke liye kaha jaataa he, lekin park hi nahin hoga to ham naa hi ped laga paaenge or naa hi khel paaenge kyonki rohinee sector 8 ke jis park me wo khelti he vahaan par didie ke park ko community centre main badla ja rahaa he

 When the West Indies and India clash in the second semi-final of the World T20 to be held at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, all eyes will be on two friends Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli playing together for the Royal Challengers Bangalore
 is match kaa nateeja kaaphi had tak inke balle se uthne vaale tufaan par nirbhar karata he
 But apart from this, there are at least five factors that will leave their mark in this cross-border battle
 aaie ham aapako bataate hai wo paanch factor jo is match kaa nateeja badalane kaa dam rakhte hai
 1
 samual badri-suleman ben kii spinwestindies ke spinneron ne is puure toornament main acha pradarshan kiya he
 Suleman Benn is supporting Samuel Badree, who is number 1 in the ICC T20 rankings
 jis tarah is toornament ke pehle hi match main newjiland ke mishael santner or ish sodhi kii spin jodi ne bhartiya ballebaajon ko chaaron khaane chit kiya tha use dekhte hue team india ko inase saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he
 It is important to mention here that opener Rohit Sharma 45 runs and Shikhar Dhawan 43 runs in four matches, while Suresh Raina, who is coming at number four, has been able to score only 41 runs
 2
 The all-round game of Darren Sammy and Andre Russell, West Indies captain Darren Sammy has not shown much with the bat and ball in this tournament so far
 darasal team ke achche pradarshan ke chalate saimi ko batting or bowling kam hi kerani padi he lekin in donon department main apana din hone par ye acchhee-acchhee tiimon kii khabar le sakate hai
 Apart from Sammy, Andre Russell is also a big threat in this format
 is toornament main rasel westeindies ke leading wicket tekar hai
 Russell is such a batsman who comes in any order and has the ability to change the result of the match in 10-20 balls
 dhoni ko inke liye vishesh taiyaari karne kii jarurat he
 3
 marlan sampuls-landal simons kii battinsrilanka main hue 2012 ke tii20 world cap final ko bhala koun bhul saktaa he
 After a poor start, West Indies' Marlon Samuels single-handedly led his team to a respectable score of 137 runs
 sampuls kii is pari main teen chauke or srilanka kaa manobal todane vaale 6 gaganchumbi chakke shaamil the
 He also took a wicket for just 15 runs in four overs, showing tremendous hand in bowling
 is match jitau pradarshan ke dam par sampuls ne srilanka kaa pehla mejabaan champion banane kaa sapana todate hue ‘main of da match’ kaa khitaab apane naam kiya
 On the other hand, Lendl Simmons is expected to start the innings in place of Andre Fletcher, who is in tremendous form
 ye ek aise ballebaaj hai jo ek-do over khelkar hi vipakshi bolers kaa hausala chakanachur karne kaa dam rakhte hai
 Returned after scoring runs in PSL and Big Bash League and has also scored a century in 2014 for Mumbai Indians on Indian pitch
 in donon ke liye dhoni ko damdaar ranneeti ke saath maidan main utarana hoga
 4
 viraat-dhoni ko chhod india kii kharaab battingis puure toornament main apni jabardast batting linep ke liye jaani jane vaali team india sirf ek baar 150 kaa aankada paar kar pai he
 The disintegration of the batting which was our identity is a matter of concern
 apane pehle match main duniya kii best batting linep mahaj 79 ranon par hi simat gai thi
 Even after this match, Team India could not bat in any match for which it is known
 shikhar-rohit kii salaami jodi lagaataar fail rahi he
 Suresh Raina could not redeem all the opportunities he got
 viraat kohli, yuvi or dhoni ko chhod kar kisi bhi anya ballebaaj ne kul 50 ran bhi nahin banaae hai
 Of these, Yuvraj is not in the team today
 is baat se pareshaan team nideshak ravi shastri khilaadiyon ko daant bhi pilaa chuke hai
 Once again, trust rests on Virat
 agar viraat nahin chale to
 
 
 
 ise dhyaan main rakhkar top order ko aaj ran banane hi honge
 5
 spin trek par bhartiya spinneron kaa nahin chalanepani pichon par ballebaajon ko nachaane ke liye mashhoor ravichandran aswin is siries main wicket lene main lagaataar chook rahe hai
 From the other end, the same mistake is being done by Ravindra Jadeja
 agar team india ko is match main jeetna he to unhen apane spinners se achche pradarshan kii jarurat padegi
 If Ashwin and Jadeja are unable to take wickets, then this can be a big burden for Team India
 ipel main gail ke khilaaf kaaphi safal rahane vaale aswin par is match main bhi unka tufaan rokane kaa jimmaa hoga
 Along with him, Ravindra Jadeja will also have to do well with the ball
 yuvaraj singh ke is match se baahar hone ke chalate team india ke paas spin main ek vikalp pehle se kam ho gaya he aise main in donon ko aage aakar jimmedaari uthaani hogi

 bharat ne yah baat aise samay kii jab pakistani media main khabaren thim ki islamabad jadhav kii maa ko unase milane kii anumati par vichaar kar rahaa he
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Gopal Bagle had said that the matter is now present before the International Court of Justice and India is following the time period of 13 September to give its arguments
 tippaniyan Pakistan claims that Jadhav was arrested on March 3 last year from the undisputed Balochistan province
 pakistan ke field general court marshall dwaara isi saal april main jadhav ko maut kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 India reacted sharply to this and warned Pakistan of the consequences of bilateral relations and consequences in the event of a "deliberate killing"
 paak ne jadhav par aarope lagaaya tha ki vah intelligence agency research and analysis wing yaa ro ke liye ek jasoos ke taur par kaam kar rahe the
 Pakistan claimed that he was "a serving officer in the Indian Navy"
 pakistan daawa karata he ki jadhav ko pichley saal 3 march ko nirvivaad baluchistan praant se giraftaar kiya gaya tha

 The trend of trending on Twitter has started
 iske zariye aapaki baat kuch logon kii nigaah main aa jaati he or kai baar media kii nigaah main
 Now the time has come to calculate what effect such a trend has on the system apart from minor action
 pehle bhi akhbaar main khabar aane ke baad adhikari suspend ho jaataa tha yaa tabadalaa ho jaataa tha
 Apart from this, how much change comes
 main yah baat isliye puch rahaa hum ki kuch maheene pehle noida ke home byrs yani flats kharidne waalon ne twitor par khub dhamal machaaya
 Trended and there was fierce coverage in TV channels
 akhabaaron main bhi hua
 But what did they gain from this
 thak haar kar karidaaron kii sanstha nefova ne tay kiya he ki phir se twitor par trend karaayenge kyonki pichhali baar jo trend hua tha, channelon main kawarej hua tha uskaa khaas nateeja nahin aayaa he
 As the coverage of the channels cools down, the problem has arisen again
 nefova ke sadasyon kaa kahana he ki abhi tak aisa kuch bhi nahin hua he jisase lage ki is maamle main pragati ho rahi he
 Once they see this fate of Twitter and TV, these people want to try the hashtag again
 noida main har ravivaar ko kahin na kahin isse jude mudde par baithak hoti rahati he
 The tweet keeps happening but no one pays attention anymore
 na media, na sarkaar, na builder
 Now if there is nothing from the media and social media then what to do next
 kahaan jaae
 We hope that he will get some success this time
 kya twitor kaa bhi asar ab thanda padane laga he
 In democracy, media emerged as an alternative
 samudri jowar bhaata ke pattern par kaam karata he
 After the TV is neutralized, are the governments now taking Twitter too lightly
 karrwai ke naam par khanaapurti uske baad sab kuch saamaanya
 i want to ask this question because even the students of Government Medical College, Bettiah, Bihar, felt that hearing the tweeter would cause their hearing
 medical kalege ke chaatr sani camel ne 7 sitambar ko twit kiya ki twit karne se train main milk next stesan mil jaataa he or sar teen saal se hamaare kalege kaa ek building nahin bana
 It is good that the students understood the difference that tweeting on Twitter is different and better to deliver milk or medicine but to bring basic improvement in the system is different
 chaatro ne apni maangon kii suchi twit kii he or justise for jiemasi betia naam se ek handle bana liya
 We Want Justice We Need Justice
 ummid karte hai ki betia ke chaatro kii haalat noida ke flats byrs kii tarah nahin hogi
 Where people have bought flats and called them landlords
 flats byrs kahalaane lage hai matlab bechaara flats kharid kar pareshaan he
 In 2008, Government of Bihar started Government Medical College
 maharani janaki kunwar hospital ko iske saath atech kar diya gaya
 In 2013, the first batch came to study in this medical college
 har batch main 100 chaatr hote hai
 So far, three batch students have arrived and admission of fourth batch students has started
 85 pratishat chaatr bihar medical pariksha se aate the or 15 fisadi eipamti se
 Students from Rajasthan, Himachal and Delhi also study here apart from students from Bihar
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki college main buniyadi suvidhaon kii ghor kami he
 The condition of the hospital is also bad
 bukhaar or sardi khaansee kaa hi ilaaj ho paata he
 There is a one-room library that is so shabby that it can fall anytime
 medical kii padhai ke shuruaati do saalon ke vishay kii padhai ke liye lab main jo saamaan chahie wo he hi nahin
 Departments have been made in a small room
 radiology vibhaag main eks re mashin hi nahin he
 Not until a flashlight in the ENT department, did the students see the laryngoscope until today
 kuch lab to kancreet kii bhi nahin hai
 It has been three years, but if the college runs in this condition, what will they study for their doctor? tippaniyan Along with Betia, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also announced to set up a medical college in the area
 pavapuri kaa bardhaman medical college dekhakar lagegaa ki bihar sarkaar kya kaam karti he
 If you look at Bettiah, you will feel that the Bihar government does not do anything at all
 2011 main is imaarat kii aadharshila rakhi gai
 This campus is 51 acres
 25 acre main construction ho chukaa he
 The hospital building is five storeyed and fully air conditioned
 opidi bhi airkandishnd he
 The college building is also fully air-conditioned
 hostel bhi badhiya bane hai
 On behalf of the students, we want that the Chief Minister may not install AC in his hostel but give X-ray machines in the Radiology Department so that the lives of the students are not ruined
 jab bardhaman medical college kii imaarat itani teji se ban sakati he to betia main kyon nahin kaam hua
 Bettiah has a one-room library and Bardhaman has a 4000 sqm library that too
 thak haar kar karidaaron kii sanstha nefova ne tay kiya he ki phir se twitor par trend karaayenge kyonki pichhali baar jo trend hua tha, channelon main kawarej hua tha uskaa khaas nateeja nahin aayaa he

 The students have tweeted their list of demands and made a handle named Justice for GMC Betia
 ve waant justise ve nid justise
 We hope that the students of Bettiah will not be in the same condition as the flat buyers in Noida
 kahaan to log flats kharid kar makaan maalik kahalaane lage hai
 Flat buyers have come to mean that the poor are upset about buying the flat
 2008 main bihar sarkaar ne garvament medical college shuru kiya tha
 The Empress Janaki Kunwar Hospital was attached to it
 2013 main pehla batch is medical college main padhane aayaa
 There are 100 students in each batch
 abhi tak teen batch ke chaatr aa chuke hai or chauthe batch ke chaatro kaa admician shuru ho gaya he
 85 percent of the students came from Bihar medical examination and 15 percent from AIPMT
 yahaan par rajasthan, himachal or dilli ke chaatr bhi padhate hai bihar ke chaatro ke alaava
 Students say that there is a severe lack of basic facilities in the college
 aspataal kii bhi haalat kharaab he
 Only fever and cold cough can be treated
 ek kamare kii librari he jo itani jarjar he ki kabhi bhi gir sakati he
 For the first two years of medical studies, the labs do not have the goods they want
 ek chote se kamare main vibhaag bana die gaye hai
 There is no X-ray machine in the radiology department
 ENT vibhaag main ek torch tak nahin, chaatro ne aaj tak laryngoscope tak nahin dekha
 Some labs are not even concrete
 teen saal ho gaye magar college is haalat main chalaa to ve doctorl kii padhai kya khaak padhenge
 The comments betia ke saath mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke kshetra main bhi medical college banane kaa elaan hua tha
 Bardhaman Medical College of Pavpuri will see what the Bihar government does
 betia kaa dekhiyegaa to lagegaa ki bihar sarkaar to kuch kaam hi nahin karti he
 The foundation stone of this building was laid in 2011
 51 acre kaa yah campus he
 Construction has been done on 25 acres
 aspataal kii imaarat paanch manzila he or puri tarah vaataanukoolit he
 OPD is also air conditioned
 college kii imaarat bhi puri tarah airkandishnd he
 Hostels are also good
 chaatro kii taraf se ham yah chaahate hai ki mukhyamantri bhale hi unke hostel main asi na lagaaein lekin radiolaji vibhaag main eks re mashin to de den taaki chaatro kaa jivan barbaad na ho
 When the building of Bardhaman Medical College can be built so fast then why did not work in Bettiah
 betia main ek kamare kii librari he or bardhaman main 4000 vargametre kii librari he wo bhi asi
 We hope that the students of Bettiah will not be in the same condition as the flat buyers in Noida
 kahaan to log flats kharid kar makaan maalik kahalaane lage hai
 Flat buyers have come to mean that the poor are upset about buying the flat
 2008 main bihar sarkaar ne garvament medical college shuru kiya tha
 The Empress Janaki Kunwar Hospital was attached to it
 2013 main pehla batch is medical college main padhane aayaa
 There are 100 students in each batch
 abhi tak teen batch ke chaatr aa chuke hai or chauthe batch ke chaatro kaa admician shuru ho gaya he
 85 percent of the students came from Bihar medical examination and 15 percent from AIPMT
 yahaan par rajasthan, himachal or dilli ke chaatr bhi padhate hai bihar ke chaatro ke alaava
 Students say that there is a severe lack of basic facilities in the college
 aspataal kii bhi haalat kharaab he
 Only fever and cold cough can be treated
 ek kamare kii librari he jo itani jarjar he ki kabhi bhi gir sakati he
 For the first two years of medical studies, the labs do not have the goods they want
 ek chote se kamare main vibhaag bana die gaye hai
 There is no X-ray machine in the radiology department
 ENT vibhaag main ek torch tak nahin, chaatro ne aaj tak laryngoscope tak nahin dekha
 Some labs are not even concrete
 teen saal ho gaye magar college is haalat main chalaa to ve doctorl kii padhai kya khaak padhenge
 The comments betia ke saath mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke kshetra main bhi medical college banane kaa elaan hua tha
 Bardhaman Medical College of Pavpuri will see what the Bihar government does

 In 2008, Government of Bihar started Government Medical College
 maharani janaki kunwar hospital ko iske saath atech kar diya gaya
 In 2013, the first batch came to study in this medical college
 har batch main 100 chaatr hote hai
 So far, three batch students have arrived and admission of fourth batch students has started
 85 pratishat chaatr bihar medical pariksha se aate the or 15 fisadi eipamti se
 Students from Rajasthan, Himachal and Delhi also study here apart from students from Bihar
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki college main buniyadi suvidhaon kii ghor kami he
 The condition of the hospital is also bad
 bukhaar or sardi khaansee kaa hi ilaaj ho paata he
 There is a one-room library that is so shabby that it can fall anytime
 medical kii padhai ke shuruaati do saalon ke vishay kii padhai ke liye lab main jo saamaan chahie wo he hi nahin
 Departments have been made in a small room
 radiology vibhaag main eks re mashin hi nahin he
 Not until a flashlight in the ENT department, did the students see the laryngoscope until today
 kuch lab to kancreet kii bhi nahin hai
 It has been three years, but if the college runs in this condition, what will they study for their doctor? tippaniyan Along with Betia, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also announced to set up a medical college in the area
 pavapuri kaa bardhaman medical college dekhakar lagegaa ki bihar sarkaar kya kaam karti he
 If you look at Bettiah, you will feel that the Bihar government does not do anything at all
 2011 main is imaarat kii aadharshila rakhi gai
 This campus is 51 acres
 25 acre main construction ho chukaa he
 The hospital building is five storeyed and fully air conditioned
 opidi bhi airkandishnd he
 The college building is also fully air-conditioned
 hostel bhi badhiya bane hai
 On behalf of the students, we want that the Chief Minister may not install AC in his hostel but give X-ray machines in the Radiology Department so that the lives of the students are not ruined
 jab bardhaman medical college kii imaarat itani teji se ban sakati he to betia main kyon nahin kaam hua
 Bettiah has a one-room library and Bardhaman has a 4000 sqm library that too
 betia ke saath mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke kshetra main bhi medical college banane kaa elaan hua tha
 Bardhaman Medical College of Pavpuri will see what the Bihar government does
 betia kaa dekhiyegaa to lagegaa ki bihar sarkaar to kuch kaam hi nahin karti he
 The foundation stone of this building was laid in 2011

 Model-turned-nun x Bigg Boss Contestant Sophia Hayat separated from her husband after 1 year of marriage
 unhone pati par frod hone kaa aarope lagaaya or ghar se bhi nikaal diya
 Sophia accuses the husband of selling the engagement ring and Rolex watch
 pati ke dhokhe ne sophia ko tod diya he
 She has posted a video on Insta in which she is seen crying bitterly
 rote hue sophia kah rahi hai ki brallep se deal karnaa bahut mushkil hota he
 Losing a child and husband at the same time is a big shock
 maine ye baaten public kii kyonki main use sabak dikhaanaa chaahati thi
 It is very difficult for me to go through all these things
 kaash kuch magic ho or ye samay guzar jaae
 i don't hate Vlad, but after what he did, it was better for Vlad to leave my life
 Break ups are hard
 
 you gotta cry and let it go
 
 it is not easy to lose a child and husband at the same time
 
 it is ok to cry
 
 
 
 my heart doesn't want any more pain
 
 i do not hate Vlad
 
 quite the opposite but i have to let go for what he did

 In which it was written that i will forgive you, but not for you but for yourself
 main apane dil main khatas or gussa nahin rakhana chaahati
 i forgive you because hating someone is like holding someone close to you and i don't want to have any connection with you
 i forgive you with so much love
 i hope you have learnt that greed and jealousy is the ego is Satan
 Greed leads to deceipt and immorality which is the breeding ground for illness and war on our earth
 Every act of hate and war on this earth begins with self hate and self destructiveness
 Face your true inner self
 Choose to be well Choose to be free Choose to be love
 i set you free and transcend you to the highest light
 May you receive wisdom from this experience and be able to accept pure love
 i am sorry ypu were unable to onow true love
 May you let go of the karmic energetic ties to all that is not love
 i choose to let go of your energy from my space and i retrieve all my energy from yours
 Thankyou
 It is done and so it is
 a post shared bysofia Hayat (@sofiahayat) onmay 2, 2018 at 7:46 am PDT In a recent interview of Sophia's serious allegations against her husband, Sophia made many sensational revelations about her husband
 sophia ne bataaya, usne mujhase kai baar jhooth bolaa
 He does not even have money
 uske saare kharche maine khud uthaae hai
 i came to know of his wrong intentions when the money started disappearing from my purse
 meri property se jude kagajaat nahin mil rahe the, maine unhen uske bag main paaya
 Sophia's marriage did not last even 1 year, removing her husband as Satan was the most surprising thing when i saw her chatting with my ex wife
 usne shaadi kii ring bhi waapas nahin kii he, usne waapas karne se manaa bhi kar diya he
 But later i realized that it cost 10 lakh rupees
 maine use meri sagaai kii anguthi or rolex ghadi bechate hue pakadaa
 The controversial Gujkok (gujarat Terrorism and Organized Crime Prevention Act, gujcotoca) bill in Gujarat has got the approval of the Governor
 gujarat vidhansabha main virodh ke bich yah bill 30 march ko chauthi baar paas hua tha
 Since then, many organizations in Gujarat are opposing it
 ye sanghathan apni baat kehane ke liye 18 april ko rajyapal se mili the or is bill ko naamanzoor karne kii unase guzarish kii thi
 But, now news is coming that the Governor has stamped his approval on this bill and sent it to the Ministry of Home Affairs for the President's approval
 ye bill dobaaraa se ab raashtrapati ke paas pahunchaa he, mahatvapurn he ki isse pehle do raashtrapati is bill ke aapattijanak praavdhaanon ke chalate is bill ko naamanzoor kar chuke hai
 The provisions of this bill, which are opposed, are that the statement made in front of the police can be considered as evidence and it can also be presented in the court as evidence, the period of police remand is generally up to 15 days
 It can be up to 30 days in cases filed under it
 saath hi kisi maamle main chargeshit daayar karne kii samaysima jo aam taur par 90 dinon kii hoti he, use badhaakar 180 din kii ja rahi he
 The protesting Congress and the human rights activists fear that these provisions will bring considerable power to the police, which is likely to be misused
 aakhir isse pehle pota kanoon ke tahat aise hi praavdhaanon ke durupyog hone kii ghatnayen saamne ai hai
 The comments is bich maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta 1 may ko dabaav banane ke liye ahmedabad main is bill ke praavdhaanon ke khilaaf badi raily karne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai or raashtrapati se samay maanga gaya he taaki unase milakar ye anurodh kiya ja sake ki is bill ko wo bhi apane purv raashtrapatiyon kii tarah thukraa den
 Now everyone's eyes are on what the President is going to do
 ullekhneey he ki is bill kaa naam pehle gujarat sangathit aparaadh rokthaam adhinium (gujarat Control of Organised Crime Act - GUJCOCA) tha, jise is baar badalakar gujarat aatankwaad evam sangathit aparaadh rokthaam adhinium (gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime Act - gujcotoca) kar diya gaya he

 This bill has again reached the President, it is important that two presidents have rejected this bill earlier due to the objectionable provisions of this bill
 is bill ke jin praavdhaanon ko lekar virodh he ve hai, police ke saamne diya gaya bayaan saboot mana ja saktaa he or use saboot ke taur par court main pesh bhi kiya ja saktaa he, police remand kii miyaad aam taur par 15 din tak kii hi hoti he jo iske tahat darj honevaale maamalon main 30 din tak kii ho sakati he
 Also, the time limit for filing the charge sheet in a case, which is generally 90 days, is being increased to 180 days
 virodh dal congress or maanavadhikaar kaaryakartaaon ko bhay he ki in praavdhaanon se police ke paas kaaphi takat aa jaaegi jiskaa durupyog hone kii puri ashanka he
 After all, there have been instances of misuse of similar provisions under the POTA Act before this
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, human rights activists are preparing to hold a big rally in Ahmedabad on May 1 against the provisions of this bill and the President has been asked to take time to meet them and request that this bill should be given to his former Reject like presidents
 ab sabhi kii nigahen is par lagi hai ki aakhir raashtrapati is par kya rukh apanaate hai

 This means that if you have gold in your house, you can deposit it in the bank and get interest on its value

 This account is named Gold Monetization Account
 kahaan par khulenge gold monetigeshan account?gold acount general bainkon main hi khulenge, jahaan par loker kii suvidha ho
 Only coins, biscuits and bars can be deposited in these accounts
 gahanon ko is skim main shaamil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Not only ordinary people, jewelers, banks and other institutions will also be able to monetize their gold and earn interest on it
 jewelers apane gold acount par lone bhi le sakenge
 How much interest will you get? The gold account will replace all ongoing gold deposits and schemes such as gold loans

 lekin bainkon main infrastracchar kii kami kii vajah se ye skim ab tak talati rahi he
 The challenge of infrastructure will still remain, as gold purity testing, storage and transportation facilities are not yet available in common commercial banks

 Despite this, India is the largest buyer of gold in the world
 hamaare desh main har saal kareeb 1000 ton sona videshon se kharida jaataa he
 This puts a lot of burden on the exchequer, just like the government has to spend huge amount of foreign exchange every year on purchasing crude oil
 gharon main padaa sona baahar aayega, to emport kaa pressure bhi kam hoga or keemtee videshi mudra duusare jaruri kaamon main kharch hogi
