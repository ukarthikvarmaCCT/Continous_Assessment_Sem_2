 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said that Air India should be disinvested but its ownership should be given to the Indian company which is capable of running it in an efficient manner
 ullekhneey he ki sarkaar ne karj ke boj se dabi rashtriya airline kii bikri kii prakriya shuru kii he
 Bhagwat warned the government that it should not lose control and ownership of its sky
 unhone kaha ki air india ke parichaalan kaa thik se prabandhan nahin kiya gaya
 "the ownership of Air India should be given to those who are capable of running it in an efficient manner," the union chief said in a lecture organized on the topic 'indian Economy and Economic Policies'
 nayaa operator bhartiya khilaadi hi hona chahie
 '' Comments bhagwat ne kaha ki duniya main kahin bhi rashtriya airline main 49 pratishat se adhik videshi nivesh kii anumati nahin he
 He specifically mentioned Germany where the foreign shareholding limit is just 29 percent
 unhone kaha ki yadi videshi hissedari kii seemaa 49 pratishat ko paar kar jaati he to sheyaron ko jabt kar unhen gharelu niveshkon ko bechaa janaa chahie, jaisaa anya deshon main kiya jaataa he

 unhone vishesh rup se germany kaa zikr kiya jahaan videshi hissedari kii seemaa sirf 29 pratishat he
 He said that if the foreign shareholding limit crosses 49 per cent, then the shares should be confiscated and sold to domestic investors, as is done in other countries

 Although the Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar continues to describe the wave of bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha elections as 'blower's wind', but after the results of the election, this wind did not allow the JDU arrow to hit the target properly
 is hawa main jahaan jediu ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ko madhepura se haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa, vahiin mukhyamantri party ke andar or baahar ke logon kaa dabaav nahin jhel sake or unhen pad se istipha tak dena padaa
 Political analysts believe that it was not easy for Nitish to withstand the kind of opposition that had started emerging during the Lok Sabha elections as well as within the party
 vaise nitish ke virdohi ise bhale hi naatak kah rahe hon, parantu raajnneeti ke jaankaar ise sahi kadam bataa rahe hai
 Political analyst Anil Prakash said, "the outcome of the Lok Sabha was not in line with the jdu's expectation and his resignation was being demanded by the opposition parties at par
" aise main unke paas istife ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 While resigning, he has set an example of political maturity, while he has also given the message of opposition and the common people not to be fascinated by power
 'aamtaur par 16 june, 2013 ke baad jab bijepi se jediu alag hui, tabhi se mukhyamantri saarvajanik taur par satta ke moh nahin hone kii baat kehete rahe hai
 In such a situation, the Opposition has been accusing them of doing anything to stay in power, by asking them to run the government with the support of Congress
 aise main nitish ne is kadam se aise virodhiyon ko bhi chup karaane kaa prayaas kiya he, jo sattasukh ke liye koi bhi samjhauta karne kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai
 Prakash says that Nitish should go to the polls for a new mandate
 ve kehete hai ki nitish jab tak sarkaar ke mukhiya rahe, tab tak bijepi ke agendon ko bihar main khulkar lagu nahin hone diya
 The BJP may have got the mandate of the government, but it will take a long time for the BJP to wash its allegations of being communal
 aise main nitish ke liye yah sakaaratmak rahaa he ki unhone mukhyamantri ke taur bihar main sampradayik takaton ko nahin badhane diya
 This step will also increase their vote bank in the Bihar scenario
 is sandesh ko lekar ab unhen gaanv-gaanv janaa chahie
 However, Nitish has resigned on moral grounds after an embarrassing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, and not only has tried to convey a message to the opposition, but has also shown a political maturity
 is tarah dekha jaae to nitish ne apane 'tir' se kai nishane saadhe hai

 When was the last time you protested against hate and violence
 yah sawaal aap bharat main baithkar puuchhiye or bharat se america gaye bharatiyon se puuchhiye
 i do not know how many Indians are among the many types of American citizens who go against that violence when blacks are shot in America
 kuch na kuch to hote honge lekin america main rah rahe bhartiya samudaay kii aisi koi pahchaan he ki gandhi ke desh se aae ye log nasli or mazahabi hinsa kaa har haal main virodh karte hai
 Do the people living there take to the streets to protest against the politics of violence here
 kahin aisa to nahin ki bharat ko lekar unki chuppi, america main ek bhartiya kii hatya ko lekar bhi chup kar rahi he
 When you do not speak there, with what mouth will you speak here? america main pradesh, bhashaa, dharm, jati ke hisaab se bharatiyon ne sanghathanon kii dukaan khol rakhi he
 Hopefully everyone will be opposing the changing environment in the Super Mall of Hate
 america ke cansus ke oleth shahar main srinu ko ek amareeki naagarik ne goli maar di
 The young son is not lost by his mother in any accident, but in the face of the ever-spreading flames of hate and violence, our silence has killed you all
 ham america main ho rahi aisi baton ke khilaaf laachaar or chup nazar aate hai, ham bharat main ho rahe aisi baton ke khilaaf laachaar or chup nazar aate hai
 Father has been a scientist
 kisi ko musalmaan to kisi ko ashwet samaj kar nishandehi ho rahi he
 We are all giving such things air by sitting in the drawing room

 And now we do not understand what to do when the storm of this hate took the life of Srinivas
 videsh mantri ne amareeki duutavas se sampark kiya he or ghatana kii ninda kii he
 The Indian embassy is tracking the incident in Kansas and is seeking help
 sushamaa swaraj is maamle main vaise bhi kabhi peeche nahin rahati hai
 The question is whether the Indian community is opposing the politics of hatred there and here, is it understanding the dangers that they themselves may be victims of
 shrinivas or alok cansus ke ek maykhaane main apni shaam bitaa rahe the
 Was watching basketball on TV
 tabhi nashe main dhutt amareeki naagarik adam purinton ne samajha ki ye log madhya purv deshon ke hai
 That means Arabs can be Muslims, that is, they are not Americans by color, then they are working illegally in America
 yah aadmi khud hi shrinivas or alok se ulajh gaya ki mere desh se baahar jaao
 You hear this voice everyday in India, but you keep quiet
 purinton vahaan ke hisaab se to nau sainik he
 He will have the certificate of patriotism because he is a soldier
 use na to itihaas maaloom, na mazahab maaloom, na naagarikta bas nafrat ne itnaa sanakaa diya tha ki dakshin bharat ke shrinivas ko desh chhodkar jane ke liye kehane laga
 People who retired from the army speak the same language on TV channels daily
 purinton baar se gaya or laut kar aayaa
 Shot straight
 shrinivas kii maut ho gai or uskaa dost alok ghayal ho gaya
 a Hindu was killed as a Muslim
 agar aap is baat se samaj sakate hai to aise hi samajhiye
 Where do we look so differently with color and hull
 isiilie poocha ki bharat se lekar america main jab koi nafrat kii baat karata he to kya aap virodh karte hai
 But wait
 24 saal ke ian grilot ke bina yah kahani kaise puri hogi
 This boy protested against Purinton
 use laga ki purinton kii bandook main goli nahin he, wo rokane ke liye aage badha
 Purinton did not spare its own citizen in the craze
 kyonki wo nausainik he, deshbhakti kaa certificate lekar gum rahaa hoga
 Shot in the chest and arm
 ian ne kaha ki wo sirf maanavtaa ke naate bachaane gaya tha
 His friends are asking for his treatment expenses
 america main bhartiya duutavas ko na sirf shrinivas or alok ke parivaar ko madad kerani chahie balki ian grilot ke ilaaj kaa karcha bhi uthaanaa chahie
 This is the young man who will be recorded in history for the fact that when powerful people were spreading the words of gestures or clear hatred as Prime Minister and President, he went to save the life of an Indian by risking his life
 hashtag chalaane waalon kaa raajnneetik giroh agar is hinsa par nahin bol saktaa he to kam se kam ian grilot ke liye to bol hi saktaa he
 An Ian Grilat is also in India
 yaheen dilli main
 Ramjas College went to save the students when violence took place
 itnaa maaraa gaya ki inaki pasaliyon main gahari chot ai he
 Professor Prashant Chakraborty also did not care, just he went out to save a student engulfed in violence
 bataate hai ki mafalar se unka galaa ghonta gaya
 Now they have returned home
 magar doctoron ne kaha he ki prashanth ko do hafte ke liye aaraam karnaa hoga
 Ian and Prashant's destiny is the same
 aise log hameshaa akele aage badhate hai or akele rah jate hai
 The rest of the people sit in the drawing room and keep quiet on the politics of hatred as if their job is only to vote
 isiilie ham na to shrinivas ke liye bol pate hai na prashanth ke liye
 a religion is being openly targeted
 nafrat yahaan tak aa gai he ki mashhoor baksar mohammad ali ke bete jab america ke kisi airport par jamaica se pahunche to unase poocha gaya ki tumhaara mazahab kya he
 The officer would be a fool whose name would be Mohammed Ali, obviously he would be a Muslim, but his motive was the same, to humiliate someone by looking at the name and religion and color
 daraana
 It was the month of January
 trump shapath le chuke the
 In the election campaign itself, there was a lot of talk about women
 duusare mulkon se aakar america main kaam karne waalon ko baahar nikaalane kii baat kii ja rahi he
 Hatred is being spread against Muslims
 iske khilaaf america bhar se auraten ladkiyaan or purush washington pahunche or washington ko vaise postaron bannron se bhar diya jin par likhaa tha ki hamen is tarah kii baaten bardaasht nahin hai
 The people of America did so much that they expressed it immediately after the swearing-in, but when the election was going on, these people did not take the words of hate seriously
 jab bade netaa kisi samudaay ko aise target karenge to unke kaaryakarta or samarthak aisi sanak ke shikaar honge hi
 They will also feel that an engineer from other countries is to blame for America's economic crisis
 isliye wo rang ke aadhaar par us ejeeniyar ko musalmaan samajhataa he or gaali maar detaa he
 You have to understand the formula of this politics of hate
 yah sirf musalmaan ke khilaaf nahin he
 It is also against those who do not have the same color as white Americans, they are also against those who come from other countries and work there
 zehar itnaa mil gaya he ki in sabase ek hi pahchaan bani he
 Who is external koun bhitari he
 The outsider can be killed because of being a Muslim, also because of IT engineer and despite being a Hyderabadi, he can be killed as Saudi Arabia
 aap is raajnneeti kaa formula bharat main bhi khoj sakate hai
 Will be found easily lekin puri duniya aisi nahin he
 The comments 18 farvari, 2017 ke din spain ke tamaam shaharon kii sadakon ko lakhon logon ne bhar diya
 People everywhere in Barcelona, madrid, came out of their homes to explain why their government is delaying settling refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq
 17000 logon ko basaane kaa vaada tha, abhi tak 1100 sharnaarthiyon ko hi kyon basaaya gaya
 These millions of people have no fear that they will be Muslims, they will be from other countries
 magar yuddh or hinsa ke shikaar in sharnaarthiyon ke jeene or basane ke haq main baahar nikle
 Can you imagine any such performance in India
 shrinivas kaa dost alok madasani ghayal he
 His father Jaganmohan Reddy has said that because of the atmosphere of hate and blind nationalism in America, this country no longer seems safe for Indians
 unhone kaha ki yah paagalpan acha nahin he kyonki hamaare bahut se bachche vahaan rahete hai
 This hatred is not right

 That is why when someone from India to America talks about hatred, do you protest? magar rukiye
 How would this story be complete without 24-year-old Ian Grillot
 is ladke ne purinton kii baton kaa virodh kiya
 He felt that there was no bullet in Purinton's gun, he proceeded to stop
 purinton ne sanak main apane hi naagarik ko nahin bakhsha
 Because he is a naval, he must be walking with a certificate of patriotism
 chaati or haath main goli maar di
 Ian said that he had only gone to save humanity
 uske dost iske ilaaj ke karche ke liye chanda maang rahe hai
 The Indian Embassy in America should not only help Srinivas and Alok's family but also bear the cost of treating Ian Grillot
 yah wo jawan he jo itihaas main isi baat ke liye darj hoga ki jab taqatvar log pradhanmantri or raashtrapati banakar ishaaron ishaaron main yaa saaf saaf nafrat kii baaten failaa rahe the to vah apni jaan jokhim main daalkar ek bhartiya kii jaan bachaane gaya tha
 If a political gang of hashtags can't speak on this violence, at least Ian Grillot can
 ek ian grilat bharat main bhi he
 Right here in Delhi
 ramajas college main hinsa hui to chaatro ko bachaane ke liye gaye
 He was killed so much that his ribs were deeply injured
 professor prashanth chakravarti ne bhi parvaah nahin kii, bas ve hinsa main ghire kisi chaatr ko bachaane nikal gaye
 It is said that he was strangled by the muffler
 ab ve ghar laut aae hai
 But doctors have said that Prashant will have to rest for two weeks
 ian or prashanth kii niyati ek si he
 Such people always move alone and remain alone
 baaki log drawing room main baithkar nafrat kii raajnneeti par aise chup rahete hai jaise unka kaam sirf vot dena he
 That is why we neither speak for Srinivasa nor for Prashanth
 khulkar ek mazahab ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Hate has come so far that when the son of the famous boxer Mohammad Ali arrived from Jamaica at an airport in America, he was asked what is your religion
 adhikari murkh hoga jiskaa naam mohammad ali hoga zaahir he musalmaan hi hoga magar uskaa makasad ek hi tha, naam or mazahab or rang dekhakar kisi ko apamaanit karnaa
 To frighten janvari kaa maheenaa tha
 Trump was sworn in
 chunaav abhiyaan main hi auraton ko lekar anaap-shanaap baaten kii ja rahi thim
 Coming from other countries, there is talk of expelling those working in America
 musalamaanon ke kilaaf nafrat failaai ja rahi he
 Against this, women and men from all over America reached Washington and filled Washington with posters with banners that said that we do not tolerate such things
 america ke logon ne itnaa to kiya ki shapath grahan ke turant baad yah jataa diya lekin jab chunaav chal rahaa tha tab in logon ne nafrat kii baton ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 When big leaders target such a community, their workers and supporters will fall prey to such a craze
 unhen bhi lagegaa ki america kii aarthik tangi ke liye duusare mulk se aayaa koi ejeeniyar doshi he
 Therefore, on the basis of color, he considers the engineer as Muslim and abuses him
 aapako nafrat kii is raajnneeti kaa formula samajhnaa hoga
 It is not just against Muslims
 yah unke khilaaf bhi he jinka rang shwet amarikiyon jaisaa nahin he, unke khilaaf bhi he jo duusare desh se aakar vahaan naukari karte hai
 Poison has got so much that only one identity has been formed
 koun bahari he
 Who is inner jo bahari he wo musalmaan hone ke kaaran bhi maaraa ja saktaa he, ai tii ejeeniyar ke kaaran bhi or hyderaabadi hote hue bhi saudi arab kaa samaj kar maaraa ja saktaa he
 You can find this politics formula in India as well

 There was a promise to settle 17000 people, so far why only 1100 refugees were settled
 in lakhon logon ko is baat se koi bhay nahin he ki ye musalmaan honge, ye duusare mulk se honge
 But victims of war and violence came out for the right to live and settle for these refugees
 kya aap aise kisi pradarshan kii kalpana bharat main kar sakate hai
 Srinivas's friend Alok Madasani is injured
 unke pita jaganmohan reddy ne kaha he ki america main jis tarah nafrat or andh rashtrawaad kaa maahaul he, usase yah desh ab bharatiyon ke liye surakshit nahin lagata he

 com / imih5ncivb aajkal tivi par aa rahe ek dharmik serial kaa ek drishy kuch is tarah haih sita pahadiyon par saiyr karne ke liye jaati hai or vahaan unhen ram mil jate hai
 Sita tests Rama there
 ve unase sawaal puuchhati hai ki ve bhi anya raajaaon kii tarah bahuvivaah main yakeen karte hai yaa ek aurat main
 Ram says that he wants to end polygamy
 is tarah ve sita ke dil ko puri tarah jeet lete hai
 It is probably different from the traditional Sita shown on television
 yah sita ram se jude apane sandehon ko dur kar rahi he, or unhen lekar apni raay ko or pukhta karne kii koshish main juty he
 Just like the girls of today want to know everything about their soul mate and before they become her partner, they hit everything
 yah televijan par dharmik dharawahikon ke nae daur kii dastak he
 In this, characters are being picked up from mythological texts, and the whole story is presented from their perspective
 in kahaniyon ko samakaleen paridrishy main set karne kii bharpoor koshish najar aati he
 "the story of Ramayana has been told many times before but it was never introduced from the perspective of Sita," says Anand Neelakanthan (story of Asura: The Saga of the Defeated), a story consultant writer for Star Plus serial Siya Ke Ram
 sita hindu mithology kii sabase majboot mahila hai
 Stronger than Draupadi
 ve hajaaron saal se bhartiya mahilaon kii role model rahi hai
 Sita's questioning of polygamy proves to a large extent that the face of religious serials has changed
 aisa nahin he ki yah kahani mahaj aadhunik rup dene ke liye gadhi gai he
 Rather it is taken from the passages of Ramayana written in different languages
 bhawabhooti ke maarmik sanskrit naatak uttar ramcharita bhi iskaa strot he
 "it depicts the great love story of Ram and Sita," says Neelkanthan
 ramayana par aadhaarit dharawahik aksar tulsidas ke ramcharitamanas ko centre main rakhkar rache gaye hai
 "old stories, new revolting times are clearly heard on the threatening channels
 tabhi to ve dharmik granthon ke aise pahaluon ko chhaantkar pesh kar rahe hai jo yaa to achoote rahe hai yaa phir jin par achche-se tavajjo nahin di ja saki he
 Sankatmochan Mahabali Hanuman and Suryaputra Karna coming on Sony channel are examples of this, in which the story starts from the childhood of Bajrangbali and Ramayana comes from the same angle
 and tivi par shuru hue santoshi maa kii tagaline hi yah he ki santosh ke paath padhaane aa rahi hai santoshi maa
 It has the story of a girl named Santoshi, who is a devotee of Santoshi mother and comes out of trouble due to her at every difficult moment
 apik channel par aa rahaa devloak vid devdatt patnayak dharm or usase jude rahasyon ke bare main jaanane kaa ekadam anokhaa sho he, jisamen myth=mithyaa tathaa shikhandi jaisi kitaaben likhane vaale lekhak devdatt kai tarah ke sawaalon ke jawaab dete hai
 On the other hand, Sahara Forest is the story of a fearless Shiva Purana and a fearless woman taken from Manasamangala who challenges her destiny
 isamen behula or lakhinder kii prem kahani dikhaai gai he
 Somewhere in these stories there is an attempt to connect the new generation with the old rites, and somewhere an attempt to show the mythological characters by fitting them into a new template
 trilogic digital media limited (sahaara van) kii sioo shivani jaisingh kahati hai, ''aasthaa or bhakthi ko aise khaake main rakhkar pesh kiya ja rahaa he jisase ye aasaani se samaj aa saken
 This is the new style of mythological anecdote
 ''aaj kii bhashaa, anokhaa andaajaravan ko vishwa sahitya main karishmai khalanaayak mana jaataa he
 If Rama shows us how to live, Ravana shows how we live
 ek ke bagaiyr duusare kaa koi astitv nahin he
 The same good and evil are being introduced in simple and straight words
 siya ke ram ke dialog riter subrat sinha ke mutabik, bhashaa ko sahaj rakhana hi unki praathamikta rahati he
 "because of Hindu mythology, we have to use Hindi, a Hindi that is easily understood by everyone," says Subrata, who has written the Life OK Mahadev serial
 hindustani se bachanaa hota he
 "many times, when the word foreigner comes, there is an angry response from the audience
 santoshi maa ke lekhak bhushan bataate hai, ''hamane kahani ko aaj kii samasya, rahan-sahan or aaj ke dabaav ke saath jodakar rakhaa he
 In Devaloka, this aspect has also been highlighted in how the deities talk among themselves and what they think about humans
 '' yahi nahin, siya ke ram main ram ke daudte ghode par khadey hokar tir chalaane ke alaava bhi kai haroonges acshan dekhne ko milte hai
 Experiments are also being done in the case of characters
 jaise siya keram main ravan ke liye kannada star karthik jairam ko chunaa gaya jabaki tadka kaa role kashmira shah ne kiya
 On the other hand, the six pack body of Gautam Road, playing the character of Karna, also attracts no less
 diggaj lekhakon kaa nayaa thikanapatnayak or nilkanthan jaise nami lekhakon ne tivi kaa rukh kiya he
 Where Devdutt answers the questions, Neelkanthan is an advisor in Siya's Ram
 kitaab or serial ke bare main poochne par nilkanthan kehete hai, ''tivi tii20 match kii tarah he jahaan har minute ahm hota he
 Like a novel test match, where every word is important
 ek chauke-chakke lagane se judaa he to upanyaas style or footwork se judaa he
 That is why Shyam Krishna, author of the hit serial Pratigya and next birth Mohe Bitiya Hi Kijo, is now trying his hand in mythology with Santoshi Maa
 yah puranic kathaon main nae prayogon kaa daur he, jo darshakon ko pasand aa rahaa he or unhen anokhe kisson se bhav-vibhor kar rahaa he
 There are ups and downs in every human's life
 abhinetri deepika padukon ke liye unke jindagi or kariyar kaa utaar-chadhaav saamaanya baat he
 He says that by being patient, difficult times can be successfully overcome
 deepika ne kaha, ek abhinetri hone ke naate aapako har tarah ke halaat kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Today my career is going well, but i have seen difficult times in the past, when my films were not playing and learned a lot during that time
 yah poochne par ki deepika asafalataa ko kis tarah leti hai, unhone kaha, maine yah siikhaa he ki jo bhi ho, aap jo kuch bhi karen, lekin dhairya rakhane se sabakuch sahi hota he
 Deepika stepped into Bollywood with a double role in the film 'om Shanti Om'
 unki haalia pradarshit 'happy new year' kaaphi safal rahi he
 DMK leader MK Alagiri today alleged that 'some forces' are not allowing the party chief and his father m Karunanidhi to do their work
 iske saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki unhen ‘galat tareeke se badnaam kiya gaya or party se nilambit kiya gaya’
 In front of a large number of supporters present in Madurai, he said, 'some party forces are not allowing Kalangar (karunanidhi) to work as party president
 ve party ke adhyaksh ko pareshaan kar rahi hai
 ' apana alag sanghathan banane kii atakalon ke bich bhavishya ke kadamon ko lekar apane samarthakon kii baithak bulaane vaale alaagiri ne apane nilamban ko lekar ghatnakram ke bare main sunaaya
 He was the organization secretary of DMK South Zone

 com / ufzpigyv0x vivaadit viviipi helicopter saudaper raksha mantralay ne shwet patr jari kar di he
 The Ministry of Defense has issued a white paper and clarified the matter
 raksha mantralay ne shwet patr main 12 agasta westlandelicopter kii deasambandhi saare ghatnakramon kaa vistrut byora diya he jise 2010 main antim rup diya gaya tha
 The government has issued a white paper on the helicopter scam
 bataane kii koshish ye ki usne apane str par koi kotahi nahin barti
 As the smoke of the scandal erupted, he started seeking information from Italy
 lekin sawaal uthta he ki sibiai jaanch kaa elaan karne main itani deree kyon ho gai? is bich sarkaar ne finamekkanika ko chetavanee di he ki agar dallali kii baat pai gai to us par kanoonee karrwai kii jaaegi
 In the white paper, Tafsil has been told that on 19 November 2003, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Principal Secretary and National Information Advisor Brajesh Mishra had called a meeting and suggested changing the standard of 6000 meters height
 22 disambar 2003 ko brajesh mishra ne piemo or espiji ko vichaar vimarsh main shaamil naa karne par bhi naaraazgi jataai thi
 From March 2005 to 2006 there was a long discussion between the Air Force, NSS, PMO, SPG and the Ministry of Defense and then the stringent standard was changed
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki sari kavayad endie shashan main shuru hui thi
 The UPA only implemented that
 shwet patr main raksha mantralay ne ye dikhaane kii koshish bhi kii he ki pehali baar jab ghotaale kii khabar ai thi, tabhi se wo isaki sachai jaanane ko lekar sanjeeda thi
 The white paper claimed that the government had sought information from its embassy in Rome as soon as the news of the scandal first came to light in February 2012
 iske baad se raksha mantralay lagaataar videsh mantralay ke jariye mudda uthaata rahaa
 Since the issue was in the judiciary, the entire information was not being disclosed
 kuch aisa hi ishaara buudhvaar ko raksha mantri eke antni ne bhi kiya tha
 But some things included in this white paper also raise questions on the government's seriousness
 november 2012 main raksha mantralay ko iskar jaanch ke nideshak kii chitthee mili thi jisamen helicopter ghotaale main kathith dallali ko lekar jaankaree maangi gai thi
 On this, the Defense Ministry asked the Income Tax Department that if it has any strong information, it should give it
 sawaal uthta he ki tab bhi sarkaar kyon nahin jaagi? italy par hi sarkaar ne puri tarah kyon bharosa kiya? kya sarkaar ke tantra itane pangu hai
 Obviously, the white paper that the Ministry of Defense has issued to make itself clear Pakistan does not seem to be enough
 uttar pradesh ke aligarh main sadakon par kisi bhi tarah ke dharmik aayojan par roak laga di gai he

 The district administration says that law and order should remain and no untoward situation arises, hence this decision has been taken
 darasal, jila prashasan gat saptaah us samay harakat main aa gaya tha jab hindu jaagran manch sahit kuch hindutv samoohon ne prayek mangalvaar ko sadak par hanuman chalisa kaa paath karne or aarti karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi

 Along with these Congress leaders, Awadhesh Kumar Singh and Madan Mohan Jha, who were ministers from the Congress in the then Bihar government, were also present
 lalu se mulaakaat ke baad choudhary ne kaha ki yah lalu ji se unki vyaktigat mulaakaat thi na ki raajnneetik
 He, however, attacked the BJP over the raids conducted by the CBI on 12 locations of Lalu Prasad and his family on Friday, accusing them of using government machinery to target us when they failed to defeat us through the mandate

 Let me tell you that in the midst of the raids on Lalu Yadav's family members in Bihar, the political mercury is starting to intensify

 Along with this, he has also supported the statement of Javed Akhtar

 On the other hand, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said that Deepika Padukone is the pride of our country, she has full support in the context of Padmavati film

 ' patidaaron kaa saath paane kii koshish main congress buree tarah funs gai he
 He had associated Hardik Patel with him for a 16 percent vote bank
 lekin sidi cond ke baad patidaaron main hardik kii pakad lagaataar chhootati ja rahi he
 As a result, the Patidar Reservation Committee lifted the sky as soon as the first list of Congress was released
 use lagata he ki congress ne tikat bantwaare main samiti ke netaaon ko paryaapt jagah nahin di
 In the election season, when the ticket hopes are broken, the arms flap like mridang, the slippers of the messenger running from Hardik to Rahul and Rahul's door are worn out but the Patidars do not enjoy
 pehali hi list ai thi ki pahalawaanon ko kaam mil gaya
 Patidars ransacked the office of Congress candidate from Varachha
 manapa main netaa pratipaksh prafull togadiya ke daftar main todphod kii
 In Majura, there was a fierce scuffle between Congress and Hardik's people
 puna main congress ummidavaar neelesh kumbhaani ke daftar ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 In fact, Congress has declared candidates for only 77 seats
 lalit vasoya or amit patel samet hardik patel ke teen saathiyon ko congress ne apan suchi main samahit kiya he
 But the Patidar Amanat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) said that the Congress failed on their expectations
 ahmedabad main bharat singh solanki ke ghar ke saamne itane patidaar jamaa ho gaye ki chunaav ayog ko unki suraksha kadi kerani padi
 In fact, in the platoon of Congress and Hardik, our Patel Your Patel game has started
 surat main kangras ne teen patidaaron ko tikat diya he
 But the PAAS people say where our Patidars are in it
 andolan waalon ne surat se 6 tikaton kii maang kii thi, unhen 11 sanyojakon ko ummidavaar banaae jane kii ummid thi
 Now the condition of the Congress has deteriorated, because when it comes time to eat the papadars, who put all the papad bells in their making, it is learned
 party ke prabharee ashok gahalot kii samaj main nahin aa rahaa ki ab kiya kya jaae
 Ashok Gehlot said, 'I condemn this violence
 hardik or unke kaaryakartaaon ko sooyeeboojh se kaam lenaa chahie
 Whatever the issue is, we can resolve it by negotiation '
 ab bijepi ko congress main ghamaasan majaa lene kaa mauka mil gaya he, wo pehle din se aarakshan andolan samiti ko congress kii bi team bataa rahi he
 Now the anger of the committee members on not getting the ticket has given ground to his suspicion
 mukhyamantri vijay roopaani ne kaha ki jo PAAS netaa congress ke agent banakar kaam kar rahe the, ab unki sachai khulkar saamne aa gai he
 At the same time, the condition is that the heartbeat with which Patidar used to make his move, he is not even ready to listen to them
 nateeja apane halaat se haare hardik ko twit karke unka jameer jagaanaa pad rahaa he
 Hardik's pain was reflected in the tweet
 
 Do not get immersed in the politics of politics so that the martyrdom of the heroes does not even be seen, remember your promise, you will remember the words of your tongue
 Politics has thrown itself back into the politics of its own community

 Another option is to have 14 opposition mlas absent from the vote, which will reduce the strength of the house from 221 to 207, and then the BJP will need only 104 mlas, who have a majority, for a majority

 The situation is that many states have not even been able to implement it

 This report shows that only three states have appointed permanent regulators under RERA which was to be implemented in all states (this law does not apply in Jammu and Kashmir)
 sirf 14 rajyon memrera kaa activeweb portal he
 Apart from this, only 20 states have notified the rules in this regard
 haalanki desh ke saaton centre shasit pradeshon ne rera ko lekar apane niyam adhishuchet kar die hai
 According to the Knight Frankie report, currently Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab have appointed permanent regulators under RERA
 anya jin bhi rajyon main philhal rera lagu kiya gaya he, vahaan permanent regulator kaa kaam antarim regulators kar rahe hai
 According to RERA rules, every state is required to create a web portal
 taaki develper is par project information aplod kar saken
 But the opposite is true
 haryana, assam, kerala, telugana or odisha jaise rajyon ne rera kaa web portal bhi shuru nahin kiya he
 Samantak Das, Chief Economist and National Director (research), Knight Frank, said that in other states including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, RERA also has a web portal active
 vahaan portal par develper dwaar aplod kii gai jaankaree pratyaksh taur par kisi kaam kii nahin he
 Note that 92 out of 59 of this law was notified on May 1, 2016
 iske thik ek saal baad anya section ko bhi adhishuchet kar sabhi rajyon main ise lagu karne ke liye kaha gaya
 However, given the situation of RERA, it seems difficult to take the name of the problems of home buyers
 bataa den ki maujuuda samay main kai ghar kharidaaron kaa paisa fansaa hua he
 Due to Rera's inaction and lack of strong law officers, home buyers have to move the court to withdraw their money

 Independence of Muslim women from triple talaq to neutralize Article-370 from Jammu and Kashmir, the publication of the NRC for the identification of intruders, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday completed the journey of 69 years of his life
 desh bhar main unka 70waan janmdiwas aise samay main manaaya ja rahaa he, jabaki modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal ke 100 din puure hue mahaj kuch din beete hai
 The Modi government has imposed a hat-trick of important and historical decisions in these hundred days, these were the matters which had been hanging in the country for the last 70 years
 phir chaahe wo teen talaak se muslim mahilaon ko nijaat dilaanaa ho, jammu-kashmir se anuchhed-370 hataanaa ho yaa NRC register taiyaar kar desh main avaidh rup se rah rahe logon kii pahchaan karnaa
 Freedom from triple talaq: The Narendra Modi government came to power for the second time in a row and took the first step to rid Muslim women of triple talaq
 modi sarkaar ne teen talaak ko puri tarah se bain karne or ise aparaadh ghoshit karne hetu 'muslim mahila vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan vidheyak-2019' ko loksabhaa or rajyasabha se paarit karaayaa
 Despite not having a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the Modi government managed to implement this law
 sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal se hi yah mudda bijepi ke pramukh agenda main shaamil tha
 Muslim women had been voicing against triple talaq for a long time
 is dauraan congress se lekar janata dal, teesraa morcha or atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali endie kii sarkaar rahi
 Governments also supported the Left, considered progressive
 baavjood iske teen talaak ke khilaaf kisi bhi sarkaar ne kanoon banane kaa saahas nahin dikhaaya
 This is the reason why this achievement of the Narendra Modi government is being considered historic
 anuchhed-370 ko beasar karnaamodi sarkaar ne apane duusare kaarykaal main sabase aitihaasik faisla jammu-kashmir ko lekar liya jo jansangh ke jamaane se party kii praathamikta suchi main sabase upar rahaa he
 The government, along with taking steps to make Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir effective, also divided the state into two parts
 bijepi jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataane kii maang kaaphi lambey samay se uthaati rahi thi, lekin ye masalaa har baar talataa hi rahaa
 In the last 70 years, many governments have come and gone in the country, but everyone hesitated to join hands in it
 modi sarkaar ne apane duusare kaarykaal ke 100 din ke andar hi dhara 370 ko jis tarah nishprabhavi bana diya, wo vipaksh ko bhi hairaan kar gaya
 After this decision, Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the country said that he has taken this decision very thoughtfully and the government also has a big plan for Kashmir so that development in the valley can be increased
 modi sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad kashmir main ek desh, ek vidhaan or ek nishaan lagu ho gaya he

 dilli bijepi ke pravaktaa or peshey se vakil ashvini upaadhyaay ne chunaav ayog se congress kaa chunaav chihn 'haath kaa panja' rad kiye jane kii maang kii he
 According to Upadhyay, the display of election mark up to 100 meters at the polling station on election day is a violation of Section 130 of the Representation of People Act and Rule 4 of the Code of Conduct
 isi kaa hawala dete hue upaadhyaay ne chunaav ayog ko likhit yachika dekar congress kaa chunaav chihn 'haath kaa panja' rad kiye jane kii maang kii he
 They say that the image of any part of human being should not be allotted to any political party as an election symbol
 upaadhyaay ne somvaar ko mukhya chunaav ayukta o pi ravat se is sambandh main mulaakaat kii
 He says that the Chief Election Commissioner has said to look into the petition
 upaadhyaay ke mutabik unhen is sambandh main supreme court bhi janaa padaa to vahaan bhi jaaenge
 Upadhyay states that the 'hand claw' is a human organ and is often performed before and after voting day, within and 100 meters from the polling station
 isse kisi khaas party ke chunaav chihn kaa pradarshan hota he
 Upadhyay argues that according to Section 130 of the Representation of the People Act and the Code of Conduct of Elections, no part of the human body can be an election symbol, but since 1977, the election symbol of Congress has remained a 'hand claw'
 desh ko aazaadee milane ke baad congress kaa chunaav chihn kai baar badal chukaa he
 In 1950, the Election Commission gave a pair of two bulls to the Congress
 1969 main party ke do faad hone ke baad chunaav ayog ne is chunaav chihn ko fries kar diya
 One faction (old Congress) was given the charkha election symbol in the tricolor
 vahiin indira gandhi ke netritv vaali nai congress ko gaay or bachhda chunaav chihn aavantit kiya gaya
 In 1977, the Election Commission allotted the 'hath Ka Paw' election symbol to the Congress in place of cow and calf
 unhone kaha he ki chah rashtriya partiyon main se keval ek ko hi insaani sharir ke ang kaa nishaan diya gaya he
 He has said that no part of human body has been given as an election mark to any of the 75 state level parties
 unhone kaha he ki aachaar samhita saaf taur par kahati he ki matdaan kii taarikh se 48 ghante pehle chunaav prachaar samaapt ho jayega
 Election mark cannot be shown near 100 meters of polling place even on election day, but the Congress candidates propagate their election mark by showing their palm
 unhone aisi ghatnaon kaa bhi hawala diya he, jab chunaav adhikari se congressi ummivaaron or agenton kii is harakat kii shikaayat kii gai thi
 Ashwini says that the election officer had expressed his inability to stop anyone from showing his hand
 unhone kaha he ki 2007 main emsidi ke chunaav main dilli ke tatkaaleen congress adhyaksh rambabu sharma ko isi aadhaar par chunaav ayog ne notice jari kiya tha or baad main chetavanee dekar chhod diya tha
 BJP leader Ashwini says that even on election day, Congress candidates and agents shake hands and display their election trail and appeal for votes
 unhone kaha he ki aisa congress ko vishisht chunaav nishaan milane kii vajah se hua he
 He has said that to prevent this, the Election Commission should change the Congress mark and remove the hand claw or palm from its list of election marks
 bijepi netaa ne kaha he ki agarcongress ke chunaav nishaan- haath ke panje ko nahin badla jaataa he to isse samvidhan ke anuchhed 324 or riprogentation of piples act 1951 kii dhara 130 ke anusaar swatantra or nishpaksh chunaav karaane kaa ulanghan hota rahegaa
 National and international affairs experts believe that the Simla Agreement signed on July 2, 1972, with the objective of maintaining peace between India and Pakistan, has been somewhat successful in achieving its goal
 bhartiya videsh seva ke purv adhikari or pakistan main bhartiya ucchayukta rahe ji
 Parthasarathy, however, says that the Simla Agreement has been successful to a great extent
 parthasarathi ke mutabik ‘yah isi samjhaute kii dein he ki bharat or pakistan apane rishton main rode atakane vaale muddon par aapas main mil-baithkar baatcheet karte hai
 This is the basis of the relationship between the two countries even today
 ’unhone kaha ki shimla samjhaute ke baad bani nayi niyantran rekha kaa paalan aaj bhi donon desh bakhubi kar rahe hai
 The views of Professor Rakesh Sinha of Delhi University regarding this agreement are completely opposite to Parthasarathy
 professor sinha ke mutabik is samjhaute kaa makasad bharat or pakistan ke rishte main padi daraar ko kootnithik tareeke se paatna tha lekin aisa mumkin nahin ho sakaa or aaj yah puri tarah apraasangik ho chukaa he
 Professor Sinha said that from a diplomatic perspective, the Simla Agreement was not a very good move
 is samjhaute kaa virodh tatkaaleen vipakshi dalon ne bhi kiya tha or desh main is par aam sahmati nahin ban paayi thi
 Prof
 Sinha says that the Jana Sangh had given a slogan in protest of this agreement at that time, 'desh na harari fauj na larai, haari hai sarkar hamari' shimla samjhaute ke bare main antarrashtriya maamalon ke visheshgy professor es ke gulati ne kaha ki yah samjhauta aaj raajnneetik or kootnithik rup se koi myne nahin rakhata lekin yah sach he ki bharat or pakistan ke bich behatar rishte kaayam karne kii koshishon kii buniyaad isi samjhaute ne rakhi thi
 Gulati said that despite this agreement, many times efforts were made to improve relations with Pakistan, but the situation is still intact
 haalanki, unhone ummid jataayi ki shimla samjhauta rupi aadhaar kaa istemaal kar donon deshon ke sambandh madhur ban sakate hai
 Abhishek Khanna, who has done his phd on the Simla Agreement from Jawaharlal Nehru University, said that its drawback was that it did not define the 'siachen glacier-saltoro Ridge' line

 Secularism versus developmentalists know that their opponents be it Nitish or Lalu

 All the couples are seen fighting over issues like children, money and in-laws
 shodhakartaaon ne aise muddon par jhagadne vaale jodon kii apekshaakrit khushhaal jodon ke drushtikon ke bare main bataaya he
 Amy Rauer, associate professor and study writer at the University of Tennessee in the US, said, "happier couples tend to adopt a reconciled approach in the event of a dispute and it also applies to the topics they discuss
 "jarnal family process main prakashit adhyayan ke liye, shodh team ne do alag-alag varg banaakar jodon ke muddon par gaur kiya, jinamein zyaadaatar shikshit jode the
 He described himself as happy
 inamen se 57 jode madhya umr ke the, jinaki shaadi hue ausatan nau saal ho gaye the
 Apart from this, 64 couples were taken, who were around 70 years of age and on average they had been married for 42 years
 jodon ko unke sabase gambhir va sabase chote muddon ko ek kram main bataane ko kaha gaya
 During this time, serious and big issues came up for intimacy, leisure, household, health, communication and money fights among elderly couples
 donon hi varg ke jodon ne ishrya, dharm or parivaar ke mudde ko kam gambhirtha kii shrenee kaa bataaya
 When researchers discussed couples' marital problems, all couples focused on issues with clear solutions, such as sharing household chores and how to spend leisure time
 shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki jodon ne aise muddon ko bahut hi kam chunaa, jinhen hal karnaa adhik kathin he
 Researchers said that this point could be a key to their marital success
 rour ne kaha, "agar jodon ko mahasoos hota he ki vah milakar apane muddon ko sulajhaa lenge, to unhen bade va gambhir muddon ko sulajhane kaa aatmavishvaas bhi miltaa he

 Most farmers in Gharbra, a small village in Greater Noida, about 50 km from Delhi, live by selling their cows and buffaloes to the city's milkmen
 tippaniyan When we arrived in this village to know the condition of these farmers, we met a farmer whose name is Gajab Singh
 inaki samasya thodi 'ajab' he
 In fact, Gajab Singh gave his two buffaloes to a farmer in the village a few days ago
 5 lakh rupee main bechi thi
 But now those 1
 5 lakh rupee ko lekar khaase pareshaan hai
 Gajab Singh is afraid that if he deposits these money in the bank, then he will not get any notice, because he has a Jan Dhan account with a limit of Rs 50,000
 jis kisaan ko inhone apni bhainsen bechi thi, usne inako koi raseed nahin di or na hi inhone maangi, kyonki dashakon se ye log aapas main apane jaanavar kharidte-bechate rahe hai
 Gajb Singh says what to do with his money, because the notes he got are old and now they will not change
 jab ham is gaanv main in kisaanon kaa haal jaanane pahunche, to hamaari mulaakaat ek kisaan se hui, jinka naam gajab singh he
 Their problem is a bit 'strange'
 asal main gajab singh ne kuch din pehle apni do bhainsen gaanv ke hi ek kisaan ko 1
 Was sold for 5 lakh rupees
 lekin ab wo in 1
 Troubled over Rs 5 lakh
 gajab singh ko dar he ki agar ye in paison ko bank main jamaa karaayenge, to kahin inako notice naa aa jaae, kyonki inkaa jandhan acount he jisaki limit 50,000 rupee he
 The farmer to whom he sold his buffaloes, did not give any receipt to them nor did he ask for them, because these people have been buying and selling their animals among themselves for decades
 gajab singh kehete hai ki wo apane paison kaa kya karen, kyonki inhen jo note mili wo puraane hai or ab to ye badalenge bhi nahin
 Gajab Singh is afraid that if he deposits these money in the bank, then he will not get any notice, because he has a Jan Dhan account with a limit of Rs 50,000

 samaajawaadee party (SP), bahujan samaaj party (BSP) or rashtriya lokdal (RLD) ke mahagathbandhan ne saharanpur main saajha raily kii
 SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, BSP chief Mayawati and RLD chief Ajit Singh reached the first joint rally in Deoband ahead of the Lok Sabha elections
 is mahareli main basapa pramukh mayawati ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhaajapa ke saath-saath congress ko bhi aade haathon liya
 He targeted the Congress' minimum income scheme Yojana (justice)
 mayawati ne bina naam liye congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra ke khilaaf jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that soon after the elections, parties like Congress and BJP started going to temples, mosques and gurudwaras
 dargahon par chadar chadhaane jane lagate hai
 Congress remembers only the poor at the time of elections
 basapa pramukh ne sawaal uthaaya ki sirf chunaav ke samay hi congress ko matadaataaon kii yaad kyon aati he
 He said that as soon as the elections come, the Congress does the work of vote yatra, khat yatra, ticketing of film stars in weak areas
 mayawati ne priyanka gandhi kii boat yatra par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that the people of the country are beginning to understand that it is playwright
 unhone kaha ki pashchim upi main sabhi dharmon ke log rahete hai
 Saharanpur, Meerut, Moradabad and Bareilly divisions have a large population of Muslim society
 mayawati ne kaha ki main is chunaav main muslim samaaj ke logon ko saavdhaan karnaa chaahati hum ki puri upi main congress bijepi ko takkar dene ke laayak nahin he, aisa sirf gathbandhan hi kar saktaa he
 He said that the Congress is running as if we should win or not win, the coalition should not win
 isliye usne bijepi ko phayda pahunchane vaale ummidavaar utaare hai
 Mayawati said that justice will not end poverty
 sarkari or gaiyr-sarkari kshetron main logon ko rojgaar muhaiyaa karaaye jane se garibon ko mitaayaa ja saktaa he
 He said that if our government is formed, instead of giving six thousand rupees to the poor, they will arrange to give jobs in government and non-government sectors
 congress logon ko pralobhan dekar chunaav lard rahi he
 Mayawati said that the idea of BSP has been to give jobs permanently

Jayalalithaa, popularly known as 'amma' among her supporters, has fever 22 Sep Chennai due to the body and a lack of water had been admitted to hospital
 yaheen unhen 4 disambar ko dil kaa daura padaa, jiske baad 5 disambar ko unkanidhan ho gaya
 During this time, many people are unhappy with the secrecy taken by the ruling party and the state government over Jayalalithaa's health
 isi lekar justise vaidyanathan ne kaha, media main is babat kai ashankaayen jataai gayi, or mujhe bhi is sambandh main kuch ashankaayen hai
 He said that when she was hospitalized, she was told that she was on a proper diet

 He said that if he had been an investigating officer, he would have given orders to take the body out for postmortem
 jayalalita ke nidhan kii vajahon par kai logon ko shaqjayalalita ke nidhan ko lekar kai log apni ashankaayen jataate rahe hai
 Among these people, AIADMK member PA Joseph has filed a PIL in the Madras High Court relating to the mystery of the death of the party chief

 The Aam Aadmi Party has attacked LG Najeeb Jung in the NDMC officer MM Khan murder case
 guuruuvaar ko party ne NDMC ko likhi najeeb jang kii us chitthee kaa hawala diya, jisamen adhikari par karrwai kii maang kii gai
 While AAP has demanded the arrest of Najeeb Jung, Mahesh Giri and Karan Singh Tanwar in the case, Tanwar retaliated and asked if the letter would kill anyone? Quoting a report published in an English newspaper, Raghav Chadha said, 'it is clear that a letter was written to the Honorable LG and LG forwarded the same letter to the NDMC and demanded action
 chitthee kaa number 83212 he, jo bijepi kemahesh girine likhi he
 This letter was written to benefit the hotel owner Ramesh Kakkar
 mahesh giri kii turant giraftaar honi chahie
 Did Giri have links with those who gave the contract to MM mm's murder? "get your treatment Kejriwal" On the other hand, bjp's Karan Singh Tanwar has hit back at AAP
 unhone kaha, 'chitthiyon se murder hota he kya? umame goli yaa bam hoti he kya? aaropee arest ho chuke hai
 Kejriwal should get his mental treatment after being admitted to a hospital
 nahin to ye aadmi dilli ko dubo degaa
 He is Mentally Defected
 hameshaa modi-modi karte rahete hai
 'LG said - Giri wrote a letter on May 10, meanwhile, LG has responded by issuing a statement to the allegations of' AAP '
 isamen kaha gaya he ki 10 may 2016 ko mahesh giri ne hotel maalik kaa paksh rakhte hue chitthee mili thi, jise 11 may ko endiemasi chairman ko aage badha diya gaya tha
 The two-page statement further states that MM Khan's murder is a serious tragedy for his family
 har koi yah samajhataa he ki aam aadmi party kaa daawa tuchh raajnneetik laabh ke liye he, jo dukhad he
 i did not write any love letter: Giridusari On the other hand, Mahesh Giri, who went on a hunger strike against Kejriwal's allegations in the case, said, 'they are completely trapped
 keji kaa baccha bhi bataa saktaa he ki uski mummy kahaan he
 i am also asking where is my letter
 maine koi lav letters thode hi likhaa tha jo daal kar aa gaya
 Our NDMC partner has written a letter, but where is mine
 ''chitthee main 2017 ko date kaise'giri ne aage kaha, 'ye galat logon ke chakkar main funs gaye hai
 Those who are corrupt and telling wrong things
 dilli police ko kejariwal se poochtacha kerani chahie ki aap jo kah rahe hai uskaa saboot kya he
 The letter showing is dated 2017
 matlab ek saal pehle hi letters likh diya
 Just as a date can go wrong, a lot of things can go wrong
 'bijepi netaa ne kaha ki vah maamle main apane apane vakeelon se salaah le rahe hai or jald hi ection lenge
 He said, 'rajnath ji himself came to me and said that why do you have to trouble yourself for someone who does not have the courage to argue
 '17 ko chitthee, 16 ko hi hua murdergautaralab he ki akhbaar ne apni report main likhaa he ki17 may ko LG najeeb jang ke daftar se nigam ko chittheelikhakar hotel vyapaaree maamle main mem khan par karrwai kii maang kii gai, jabaki khan kii hatya 16 may ko hi ho chuki thi
 Raghav Chadha says that this whole episode makes the same sense that the hotel owner killed an honest officer because it had political patronage, support of Tanwar and LG
 may main karnataka ke us photo avasar yaa uske do maheene purv akhilesh yadav-mayawati ke bich samjhaute ko dekhakar aisa mana ja rahaa tha ki vipakshi dalon kaa ek damdaar mahagathbandhan taiyaar ho chukaa he jo november main teen rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon or uske baad 2019 ke aam chunaav main ekajute hokar bhaajapa ke liye badi mushkilen khadi karne vaala he
 But then Mayawati obstructed it
 unhone sabase pehle chhattisgarh main ajit jogi kii janata congress ke saath gathbandhan kiya or uske baad madhya pradesh tathaa rajasthan main congress ke saath apana gathbandhan samaapt karne kii ghoshnaa kar di
 The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief said, "in the interest of the BSP movement, it has been decided that the party will not partner with the Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan at any cost
" karnataka main, hamane kshetreey party (janata dal-secular) ke saath gathbandhan kiya
 In Chhattisgarh, we formed an alliance with Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh
 madhya pradesh or rajasthan main ham vahaan ke rajnatik dalon ke saath gathbandhan kar sakate hai, lekin congress ke saath to bilkul nahin
 Mayawati, while attacking All India Congress Committee General Secretary Digvijay Singh, who accused Mayawati of being an 'agent of BJP', blamed her for the failure of coalition talks between the BSP and Congress in Madhya Pradesh
 paryvekshak is ghoshnaa se chakit rah gaye
 However, he feels that this is the only bargaining strategy of the BSP
 mayawati ko in teen chunavi rajyon main congress ke saath chunaav purv gathbandhan main zyada siten chahie isiilie aise tevar dikhaa rahi hai
 An indication of this was found on 9 October when he said in the program on the birth anniversary of BSP founder Kanshi Ram, "we will not beg any party for seats
" ham apane logon kaa apmaan bardaasht nahin karenge
 "most Congress observers believe that Mayawati is showing her familiar bargaining style
 basapa supremeo ne keval congress ke sthaneey netritv par hamale karte raheen
 She refrained from commenting on Congress President Rahul Gandhi and the United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi
 vah to yahaan tak kah gayi ki ''basapa-congress gathbandhan ko lekar sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi kii niyat par mujhe koi andeh nahin he, lekin kuch congressi netaa adchane daal rahe hai
 "she is in the mood to keep her options open for any talks before the Lok Sabha elections, by not blaming the Congress high command at all and blaming all the state leaders on the right
" is sameekaran ko sweekaar karte hue, congress netaa randeep sinsah surajevaala kehete hai, ‘‘mayawatiji ne aapasi sammaan vyakt kiya he or unhone sonia ji tathaa rahul ji main apana vishwaas vyakt kiya he
 If the three top leaders- Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and BSP President Mayawati are unanimous, then no fourth person can spoil the equation of Congress and BSP
 ’’madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main bhaajapa ke 15 saal kaa shashan khatm karne ke liye congress, basapa ke saath mahagathbandhan bananaa to chaahati thi lekin donon partiyon ke hit aapas main takaraa gaye
 In fact, both parties feel that the public has been fed up with the 15 years of BJP rule and is in a mood for change
 lihaaja donon apana-apana aadhaar majboot karnaa chaahate hai
 Congress leaders say that they could have given a maximum of 15 seats to the BSP while Mayawati wanted more than 50 seats in the 230-member assembly
 haalanki madhya pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh kamalnath, purv mukhyamantri digvijay sin ha ke bachaav main aae or kaha, ‘‘is gathbandhan ke tuutane ke liye unhen kisi na kisi ko to jimmedaar tehraana hi tha, so mayawati ne digvijay ngkshasah ko doshi tehra diya
 The fact is that the BSP wanted 50 seats and the ground situation of many of such seats is such that the BSP can never win from there
 isse bhaajapa ko sidhaa phayda miltaa
 However, being optimistic and pragmatic, Kamal Nath hopes that some way can still be found before the election
 congress ke saath kadi saudebaaji, ek hataash or aakraamak mayawati kii apni rajnatik vivashtaa he
 While the BSP did the best in these three Hindi states in 2008, the bsp's vote share dramatically declined in the 2013 assembly elections five years later
 empi main party kaa vot share jahaan 2008 main 8
 8 percent (or 7 seats), while in 2013 it was 6
 3 pratishat ho gaya or party ko bas chaar siten milin
 bsp's vote share of 6 in 2008 in Chhattisgarh
 12 pratishat (2 siten) se ghatakar 2013 main 4
 27 percent (1 seat) remained
 usee tarah rajasthan main, 2008 main jahaan basapa ne 7
 It won 6 seats by getting 6 percent votes but in 2013 both its vote share and seats were reduced to half
 2013 main basapa ko 3
 The party got 4 percent votes and the party won 3 seats
 apane mukhya garh uttar pradesh main to basapa ke vot share or siton kii sankhya main kami or bhi zyada naatakeey rahi he
 With 30 percent votes in 2007, the party formed the government by winning 206 seats out of the total 403 assembly seats in the state
 mayawati puure paanch saal kii avadhi ke liye mukhyamantri baniin
 By 2012, the bsp's vote share fell to 26 per cent and the bsp's seats fell from 206 to 80
 is tarah samaajawaadee party ke akhilesh yadav satta par kabiz hue
 Things got worse in 2017, when the bsp's vote percentage fell to 22
 2 pratishat rah gaya or party ko maatr 19 siten milin
 The BJP, which won with a thumping majority, handed over the reins of the state to Yogi Adityanath
 loksabhaa main bhi basapa lagaataar apni takat kho rahi he
 In both 2004 and 2009, the BSP won 19 and 20 seats out of the 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh respectively, but in 2014, the BSP 19
 6 pratishat vot hasil karne ke baavjood ek bhi seat nahin jeet saki
 It is the dramatic drop in bsp's vote share and seat share that has made Mayawati so desperate
 is varsh ke vidhansabha chunaavon or agle varsh hone vaale aam chunaav donon main mayawati ke liye yah ‘abhi nahin to phir kabhi nahin’ vaali sthiti he
 She is considering these elections as an opportunity to increase vote share and seat share in the heart of the Hindi heartland
 unhen lagata he ki bhaajapa shasit rajyon main daliton ke khilaaf atyaacharon ko lekar mukhar dalit chetana, anusuchit jati / anusuchit janajati (atyaachaar rokthaam) adhinium ke praavdhaanon kii dhar kund karne or naukariyon tathaa pramotion main kota kaa mudda, unka khoyaa aadhaar phir se praapt karne main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 In April this year, Madhya Pradesh became the arena for large-scale Dalit protests and six people were killed and several injured in the violence during the bandh in Gwalior, Bhind and Morena districts
 us hinsa kii lapten dekhte-dekhte rajasthan, upi or bihar jaise hindi pattee ke anya bade rajyon main pahunch gayi jahaan hinsa kii ghatnaayen bhi huin
 Mayawati wants to cash in on this resentment of Dalit community in her committed vote bank
 inke alaava, kam se kam ek darjan or aisi siten aisi raheen jisamen basapa kaa vot, chunaav ke nattejey badalane ke liye paryaapt tha
 These seats could have been snatched away from the BJP if its vote had merged with the Congress
 yahaan tak ki madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne bhi sweekaar kiya ki ‘‘congress-basapa gathbandhan bundelkhand main vishesh rup se gwalior-chambal or vindhyas kshetron ke kam se kam 15 siton main bhaajapa ke liye gambhir khatra paidaa kar saktaa he
 The party is mainly dependent on its committed vote bank of scheduled castes
 2013 main empi main usne jo chaar siten jeetin unamem se teen siten essi ke liye arakshit hai
 Two of these are in the gwalior-chambal region, where Dalits have a higher population than other areas
 shesh siten vindhyas kshetra se hai, jo empi main basapa kaa mul garh he
 The party wins those seats where the contest is triangular or where the Congress is very weak and not able to win
 basapa aamtaur par tab jitati he jab uske essi vot bank ko kuch obisi vot kaa saath mil jaataa he
 In the 1990s, the party started winning in the Vindhya region when it was backed by strong regional OBC castes like Kurmi
 haalanki, haal ke varshon main kurmi vot bank ne basapa kaa saath chhod diya he or unke vot mukhyadhara ke dalon congress or bhaajapa main bant gaye hai
 In 2013, the party won a general seat Dimani when it fielded a upper caste candidate from there
 ek brahman, balvir singh dhadotiyaa ne dalit or brahmïna voton ke gathjod se jeet sunishchit kii thi
 In both the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the bsp-congress alliance mainly depends on the transfer of votes
 congress basapa ko ek seemaa se adhik seat nahin de sakati he kyonki use aisa lagata he ki aisi sthiti main un siton par oonchi jatiyon kaa vot bhaajapa kii jholii main chalaa jayega
 The BSP believes that its vote is transferred to the Congress but the Congress vote is not transferred to it
 aise main basapa ko lagata he ki congress ke saath gathbandhan main use nuksaan hi he
 In fact, at the ground level, there is often a contest between the Congress and the BSP for the same vote bank
 mayawati ko congressi netaaon se ek or shikaayat yah he ki ve basapa ke nishkasit netaaon ko aashray dete hai
 Mayawati expelled Nasimuddin Siddiqui, the party's biggest Muslim face, after being badly defeated in the UP elections
 siddiki congress main shaamil ho gaye
 In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress is trying to project Devashish Jararia as the Dalit face of the party
 jarariya pehle basapa main the or unhone essi / asti varg ke yuvaaon ko basapa kii ore aakarshith karne ke liye bispi youth website launch kii thi
 Jararia was expelled
 mayawati ne jaraariya ko nishkasit karne ke baad yah bhi saaf kiya tha ki party kaa na to koi youth wing he or na hi koi website
 The party does not even have a Twitter handle or Facebook account
 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2017 main upi vidhansabha chunaavon main basapa ke haashie par jane se rajya ke bade hisson main ek rajnatik shunya paidaa ho gaya he
 Meanwhile, new Dalit leaders like Chandrashekhar Ravana are attracting people
 sitambar main jail se reeha hone ke baad, chandrashekhar ne mayawati ke liye kuch prem dikhaaya tha, jab unhone kaha, ‘‘vah meri buaaji hai or main unka bhatija hum
 Our blood is the same because we both come from the same community
 ’’ duusari taraf, mayawati, jo ki chandrashekhar kii hi tarah jatav samaaj se taalluk rakhti hai, bhim army ke basapa ke paramparaagat jatav vot bank ko vibhajit karne kii koshishon se chidhi hui hai
 That is why he responded very strongly to Chandrashekhar's talk: "for political reasons, some people are trying to make a connection with me
" main yah spasht karnaa chaahati hum ki meraa aisa koi buaa-bhatija yaa bhai-bahan jaisaa rishtedaar nahin hai
 If he (chandrashekhar) was a true well wisher of Dalits, he could have fought the BJP more strongly by joining our party instead of forming a party
 ’’udhar, samaajawaadee party ke pramukh akhilesh yadav ne bhi congress ko apana dil bada karne or basapa ko bhi samyojit karne ke liye protsaahit kiya, ‘‘congress ko ek soch or vichaardhaara par chalane vaali sabhi rajnatik partiyon ke saath milakar chunaav laduya chahie
 "he said this on 3 October
 lekin congress netaaon ke tavajjo na dene se jhunjhalaakar unhone congress se talmail todgaye kaa elaan kar diya
 On October 6, he said in Lucknow, "we will contest elections in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and talk of an alliance with BSP and Gondwana Ganatantra Party
" congress ne kaaphi intjaar karaayaa ab ham or intjaar nahin kar sakate
 The November assembly elections are important for both the BSP and the Congress
 uttar pradesh ke saath-saath empi, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main basapa kaa ubhaar congress ke liye jhatka hoga
 Both parties have an eye on the same vote bank and are trying hard to win the trust of that vote bank again and put it in their court which has left them
 congress ko khub andaja he ki use apane mukhya shatru bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye bispi kaa saath kis keemat par milegaa
 But unless you befriend the small enemy, you cannot win big battles

 According to him, every PM tries to do good work

 kaa muqabla siddharth malhotra kii 'e jentalman' ke saath tha
 Increase in taxes always causes resentment of people
 ise rajnatik chaturaai nahin mana jaataa
 This can create an anti-government wave
 sarkarein jab bhi karadhaan main nirnaayak badlaav kii koshish karti hai, ve iske liye khaasaa jokhim uthaati hai
 Undoubtedly, the biggest change in the country's tax system is the Goods and Services Tax (GST) with many such apprehensions
 jaahir he, kaaphi kuch daanv par he
 The importance of the GST Bill, its destructive prospects and the challenges of its implementation are evident from the fact that it first started discussion in 2006-07 and it was passed in Parliament in August 2016
 2006-07 main upie sarkaar ke tatkaaleen vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram had proposed in his budget that GST be implemented from April 2010
 tab bhi yah lakshya mahatvakankshi tha
 It was a coup for the current bjp-led NDA government
 vidheyak ke paas hone ke jashn ke vakt bhi yah chintaa bani hui thi ki yah kaise amal main aayega
 Of course, the main concern was a rate of tax across the country
 is kaam ko ab jiesti council ke hawaale kar diya gaya he
 Several assessments are already under consideration
 mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subrahmanyam kii aguai main ek cameti ne apni report main suzav diya ki jiesti ke liye rajasav upyukt dar (arenar)—vah dar jis par nai kar vyavastha se puraani vyavastha jaisi hi rajasav ugaahi ho—kareeb 15
 Will be 5 percent
 is lihaaj se cameti kii salaah he ki jiesti kii maanak dar 17 se 18 pratishat ke bich ho sakati he
 But is it effective to implement this rate in the whole country? The Revenue Secretary of the Central Government, Hansmukh Adhia, says, "no, it is not possible
" arenar ek adarsh dar he jo sabhi chizon par bina riyaayat ke lagu hogi
 But is it possible? Can poor people have to bear the brunt of this? Therefore, we cannot implement the ideal single rate of GST
 ham uski koshish kuch samay baad karenge
 But at the moment it is not an option for us
 hamen kam se kam teen daren rakhni hongi
 "though the need for tax reform like GST has been felt for a long time
 zyaadaatar deshon main aise maamalon ke liye iklauti dar he, jabaki bharat main dohari dar kaayam he
 One of the Center and the other of the states
 is maamle main yah badlaav bada he or iske thik-thik lagu hone main samay lagegaa
 Adhia says, "this is a new experiment for India
 ham sahakaari sanghavaad ke nae charan main ja rahe hai, ek aise model ke saath jisamen sabhi rajya samaan rup se saajheedaar hai
 "the first meeting of the GST Council is scheduled on 22 and 23 September
 uskaa agenda bhi utana hi mahatvakankshi he, jaisaa ki sansad main is vidheyak ko paas karana tha
 The possibility is that every state will implement its own benefit rate and will insist on keeping the items of its benefit out of the purview of GST
 adarsh rup main to jiesti kii ek hi dar honi chahie, lekin rajyon ke jor dene par ek praavdhaan yah bhi he ki prakritik aapadaa ke dauraan rajya alag dar lagu kar sakate hai
 The real fear is to lose dominance
 vidheyak ke paas hone ke pehle hi rajya or centre ke pratinidhiyon ke bich kaaphi tikhaa takaraav ho chukaa he
 States have also won some of it
 rajyon ko 1
 5 crores Rs
 yaa usase kam kaarobaar vaale maamle main lekhajokha kaa adhikaar hasil ho gaya he
 Alcohol is excluded from the purview of GST
 udyog ke log ise jiesti ke daayre main rakhana chaahate the
 The problem is that the states get about 30 percent of their revenue from alcohol and petroleum products
 philhal kuch petroleum utpaadon ko jiesti ke daayaron se alag rakhaa gaya he
 Can be included later
 ashankaayen kaimodel jiesti vidheyak ke dbrayoron par jab vistaar se bahes shuru hogi to yah dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki iskaa makasad kya he
 Adhia says, "the first objective is to provide ease of business
 kai tarah ke karon se dikkatein hoti hai
 Then there are many difficulties in moving freight from one state to another
 hamen aisi kar vyavastha bhi chahie, jisamen kar chori aasaan nahin ho
 "but there are apprehensions in many circles
 ek masalaa yah he ki kaarobaariyon ko us har rajya main panjikaran karana hoga, jahaan unka kaarobaar he
 This means that telecom companies will have to register at least 36
 isi tarah puure desh main kaarobaar karne vaale bank, vittiya sevaayen or i-commers companiyon ko iskaa dansh jhelana padegaa
 This goes contrary to the idea of ease of doing business
 vittiya salaahkaar form arnst and yang (ab evei) ke vipin saapra kehete hai, ''aaj seva kshetra behatar haalat main he
 The tax is the same and does not require multiple registrations
 jiesti ke tahat doharaa niyantran ho jayega
 "e-commerce companies are so upset that they are demanding to stay away from GST
 haalanki sarkaar is par gaur karne ko katai taiyaar nahin he
 Adhiya says directly, "why don't they want to pay tax?" The second objection to GST is about "input tax credit"
 isse bhi kai tarah kii baadhaaen utpann hoti hai
 It will not benefit the sectors like liquor, five petroleum products, real estate and electricity
 (masalan, koi doorsanchaar company agar apana tower jenerator par chalaanaa chaahati he to vah eendhan par pehle se lage kar main chhot kii maang nahin kar sakati)
 Expert Satya Poddar, who helped in framing the GST laws in countries like Canada, says, "the government has imposed restrictions on credit even in areas not outside the purview of GST
" masalan, nirmaan main laagat kharch input credit ke daayre se baahar he
 Sale of houses is also outside the purview of GST
 lekin makaan main lift se lekar bijli tak lagane main input tex credit hasil nahin kii ja sakegi
 "the second case of dispute relates to the auto industry
 companiyaan vibhinn tarah ke karon khaskar lagjri car par 40 pratishat dar se jujh rahi hai
 The definition of luxury car is also complicated, which various states have created to attract investment
 centre sarkaar ne aashwast kiya he ki agle paanch saal tak vah rajyon ko rajasav kami kii bharpai karegi
 He also has to take care that the tax is not high to correct his revenue deficit
 aditya birla samooh ke ajit ranade kehete hai ki paroksh karon kii dar par ek vidhaayi seemaa lagaai jane kii jarurat he, taaki bhavishya main sarkarein isamen ijapha na kar saken
 He says, "we have to keep the basic principle right
 kar kii dar par bavaal nahin chahie
 The tax rate should be at least and whatever shortfall should be paid further
 " poddar newjiland jaise deshon kii misaal dete hai, jahaan pehle 10 pratishat dar se shuruyaat kii gai or ab dar 14-15 pratishat tak pahunch gai he
 However there is no exemption there
 australia, dakshin africa or singapore main kuch maamalon main chhot he
 But he has a clear explanation, so that there is no dispute
 yah samajhane kii jarurat he ki kaarobaar jaise vaishvik hota ja rahaa he, sarkaar ko sabhi pakshon kii salaah se kar kanoon banane honge
 The states should not be allowed to impose a no-nonsense rate according to their needs
 desh kii nai arthvyavastha kaa dayera akhil bhartiya he
 Therefore, when the Center and the states negotiate the standard tax rate, they should keep in mind the needs of the new emerging economy, not taking into account their vote bank and immediate interests

 china ne vivaadit dakshin china sagar main vistaar ko lekar badi chintaaon ke bich buudhvaar ko apana doosraa aircraft karier (vimanavahak pot) ko samudr main utaar diya, jo ukraine se kharide gaye maujuuda pot ke saath shaamil hoga
 This will increase China's military capability
 chinaki sarkari samachar agency shinhua ke mutabik china shipbuilding industry korporation (siesisi) ke purvottar daalion shipyard main prakshepan samaaroh ke dauraan 50,000 ton ke is nae vimanavahak pot ko samudr main utaara gaya
 The Chinese Ministry of Security said that this is the second aircraft carrier in China, which has not yet been named
 jahaaj ko liyaoning, daalion shipyard se paas ke tat par laayaa gaya tha
 The aircraft carrier will reportedly be more advanced than Liaoning, a refurbished Soviet ship bought from Ukraine built 25 years ago
 chinan apane duusare vimanavahak pot kaa nirmaan kaary november 2013 main shuru kiya tha
 Construction of the dock began in March 2015
 haalanki vimanavahak pot ke saal 2020 se pehle puri tarah sakriy hone kii sambhaavna nahin he
 According to Xinhua, the process of designing and constructing the indigenous aircraft carrier of China underlines it

 Holland, who trailed Argentina by 3 goals in the first match, made a brilliant comeback after missing the goal in the first minute and scoring goals at regular intervals
 pichley match main canada ko 3-2 se haraane vaali newjiland ke liye pehle minute main captain philip baros ne gol dagkar dach kheme main halchal machaa di
 The next minute Brower Ronald scored an equalizer for Holland
 master draig flikar taeke takema (saatvaan minute) or jerron hatrjaburger (27waan minute) ne holland ke liye baaki gol kiye
 All goals were scored in the first half
 pichley match main hetric lagaakar vishwa cap main sarvaadhik gol karne vaale khilaadiyon kii suchi main pakistan ke sohail abbaas (16) kii barabari karne vaale takema ne unhen pachhadte hue apane hamawatan florious jaan bovelendar ke 17 gol kii barabari kar lee
 Now he is in joint fourth position in this list, which is named after Paul Ligence (26 goals) of Holland
 holland ke liye hatarjaburger ne 27wein minute main ek or gol karke badhat 3-1 kii kar di jo ant tak barkaraar rahi
 New Zealand had a chance to narrow the gap in the 32nd minute but their penalty corner went in vain
 duusare half main donon tiimon ne kai achche move banaaye lekin phinishing nahin de sake
 Canada would have to praise Kiwi goalkeeper Kyle Pontifex, who had lost two goals in the last match, who scored twice on a surefire drag flick from Takkema
 takema 43wein or 46wein minute main chuke
 New Zealand got penalty corners in the 51st and 60th minutes which went in vain
 ajtak ko joint invastigeshan team kii report haath lagi he
 There have been many shocking revelations in this report
 saath hi is baat kaa bhi khulaasa hua he ki hajaaron-lakhon logon ko safar karaane vaali rail ke trek par kis kadar laaparvaahee barti jaati he
 The joint report claimed that the accident occurred due to the railway line being cut and a gap in it, but the reasons behind it were shocking
 jis trek se sau kilometre se bhi zyada kii raftaar se musafiron se bhari train guzarani ho, vahaan railway ke mentanence ejeeniyar kis tarah laaparvaahee se trek ko kaat dete hai
 Irresponsible officers remain unaware of this, which is highlighting a terrible lapse of the railway's security system

 Its brunt is in the shape of Khatauli train accident
 aaie ab aapako bataate hai ki jabajoint jaanch cametisbase pehle khatauli main ghatana sthal par pahunchi, to kya kya dekha
 
 
 
 
 1
 accident kii soochna milane ke baad paanch takneekee afasaron kii joint team ghatnasthal par pahunchi
 Officers of different departments were involved in this
 2
 Interestingly, an officer of the department responsible for the aftermath of the investigation also joined the team, but he refused to sign the report
 3
 According to the joint report, the initial five coaches, including the engine, had escaped safely
 4
 The seventh coach S-10 and sixth coach S-9 met the engine at a distance of 295 meters after each other
 5
 There were 11 consecutive coach derails, including coaches S-1 to S-9 as well as part car and AC coach B-1
 6
 The derailed S-2 coach part was mounted on top of the car
 7
 The cause of the accident is the point of drop, which was found between the third and fourth part
 yahaan joint invastigeshan team ne paaya ki isi piodi par chal rahaa kamhadase kii vajahabana
 Because one end of the rail line here was cut with a hexa blade
 ise jodne ke liye nat bolt lagaae jane the
 One end was pierced and the other end had to be pierced to apply nut bolts, for which a mark was made from the chalk on the rail line
 saath hi level banane ke liye rail line ke neeche ek lakdi kaa tukdaa bhi lagaaya gaya tha
 This meant that the railway line was cut for repair and the process of connecting it was going on that the train came at full speed
 8
 The investigation committee found a nut bolt, power hexa, drill machine and sledge hammer from the point of drop
 9
 The most important thing is that the Red Banner Flag, which was put on the track for warning on the track, found a fold at the spot
 agar kaam kar rahe logon ne is flag ko trek par laga diya hota, tab bhi yah haadasa tal saktaa tha
 10
 report main kaha gaya ki jei mohanlal meena ke bayaan ke mutabik trek par permanent ve (p-way) ke jei pradeep kumaar glud joint kaa repere kar rahe the or iske liye 20 minute kaa block maanga gaya tha
 Had this block been found, this accident could have been averted
 11
 According to the SPM graph, the inquiry committee found the speed of the train to be 107 kilometers per hour during the accident
 12
 The Joint Committee wrote in its investigation report that the rail line was cut due to the accident
 daayin taraf kii rail line ko kaata gaya tha, jisase usamen gep ban gaya
 This gap was to be attached to the nut bolt by placing a fish plate, but this did not happen and the train fell victim to the accident
 GST council kii guuruuvaar ko hone vaali mahatvapurn baithak tal gai
 The meeting was expected to get approval to reduce the tax rate on electric vehicles
 iske alaava vastu evam seva kar (GST) parishad kai anya mahatvapurn masalon par is baithak main charchaa hone vaali thi
 This was to be the second meeting of the GST Council chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
 iske pehle vah 21 june kii baithak main shaamil hui thim
 The Fitment Committee has made its recommendation about the tax rate on electronic vehicles, chargers and the business associated with hiring these vehicles, which the GST Council has to consider
 ye hai pramukh masaleelectric vaahanon par tex rate 12 se ghataakar 5 fisadi karne, charger par 18 se ghataakar 5 fisadi karne or hiring par 18 se ghataakar 5 fisadi karne kaa prastaav he

 21 june kii baithak main samiti ne kaha tha ki in par jiesti riyaayaton ke bare main fitment kamity jaanch karegi or uski sifarish ko agali baithak main rakhaa jayega
 If GST rates are reduced on electric vehicles, this will be the second major step towards promoting e-vehicles within a month
 iske pehle 5 july ko vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne apane bajet bhaashan main kaha tha ki electric vaahan kharidne vaale logon ko iske lone ke byaaj bhugtan par 1
 Income tax deduction of up to Rs 5 lakh will get benefit
 sarkaar electric vaahanon par parking muft or toll tex na lene ke prastaav par pehle hi kaam kar rahi he
 These steps of the government will lead to car companies like Mahindra, Hyundai, Tata, BMW and electric vehicle companies like Hero Electric, Revolt intellicorp, Kinetic Green, Torque Motors
 modi sarkaar i-vaahanon ke gharelu menuphaccharing ko bhi badhaava dena chaahati he
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had also said in her budget speech that she wants to make electric vehicles hub in India
 iske liye bydaree, charging point jaise buniyadi dhaanche par teji se kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 The government is also considering making special lanes on the highway for electric vehicles and a decision may be taken soon
 pralapon ke samucchy se ghire is kavita sangrah ko padhakar pehle to laga ki yah kahin atirek to nahin
 Because this is the time of excesses
 lekin phir apni kavi-parampara ke hi kavi samaran ho aae, jinhone sadiyon pehle likhaah ''dukhiya das kabir he jaagai aru rovai
 Sadness, worries, remorse and lamentation / delirium are written on the poet's part
 shiris kumaar maury ke sangrah saanson ke pracheen gramophone sareekhe is baaje par kii kavitaayen dukh ke isi nimajjit antahkaran kaa paath hai
 The man grumbles in the babble because he feels helpless in the current system
 pralapon ke is mahavistaar main ye kavitaayen nirupayta or pratirodh kii khamosh ibaarat kii tarah hai
 Despite the repetition of the delirium, every poem reminds of a new aspect of suffering and in the poet's own words, "life is made up of all repetitions / repetition is not a fault in all / sometimes it is light
" ''barason pehle kailash vaajapeyi ne likhaa thah bhavishya ghat rahaa he
 In the tradition of this existentialist poet, the first verse of Shirish underlines it again - the world of the dead continues to grow
 anubhav or pratiti kii gaharaai vahi he
 He had said, the hunger of the times makes the poet cry
 in kavitaaon main paraajay or hataasha kaa bodh dikhataa he jo sambhawatah is nattejey par pahunchane main kavi kii madad karata he ki yah jivan satat chatapataahaton kaa silsilaa he
 All these poems are the result of trying to give words to different colors of pain
 upar se astitvvaadi dikhte is kavi main sab kuch hataasha or pralaap kii punarukti main hi nahin samaa gaya he
 He leisurely says this, i have a bed on one side of the landslide, sleep on the other side and final rest
 yah pahaad main pahaad-sa jivan katate vyakti kaa apana anubhav hi he kyonki vah bhuskhalanon ke bich hi jeeta, marataa he
 Where on the part of Yayawari's tafriah
 hamaara aaj kaa samay jis raajnneetik dhruvikaran ke chalate manushya ko dharm, jati, varna or sankeernataaon main baantne kii muhim chalaa rahaa he; puunji ne jis tarah aam aadmi ke astitv ko nishprabh kar diya he or jivan ko haashie par phenk diya he, har vaazib pratirodh kii hawa nikaali ja rahi he tathaa ek jhooth ko dhakne ke liye anek vibhramon kaa nirmaan kiya ja rahaa he—kavi kaa anubhav galat nahin kahata ki jivan ko bheetar se jeena or baahar se dekhnaa padataa he
 He is surrounded only by the anger that a working person cannot survive for life / create anything
 jinhone manushya ke ucchadarsh rache, unka bhi hashr gandhi jaisaa hua
 Shirish, while highlighting his poet's work, also takes a look at the artism that flourishes in the poem and it is better to take the shirt of the seventy-eighties era of a populist poet in lieu of the pen of an artistic poet; But overall the darkness and babble within these poems are so effective that they even forget to write letters in the name of lights; Also, poetry is never uncontaminated by art

 It is beyond comprehension what happened within 5 minutes that when the school started, there was an incident at the time when there was a lot of commotion in the school
 pradhyumna ke pita ne kaha ki bina kisi pre plan ke aisa nahin ho saktaa
 It is a planned crime in some way or the other

 Ever since the accident, no school official or teacher has ever had any contact with parents

 It is being told that the BJP has offered to contest the election leaving Om Prakash Rajbhar as minister, but he did not agree to it
 sutron ke mutabik rajbhar apane bete ko party simbal par hi chunaav ladaana chaahate hai
 The infighting between the BJP and Rajbhar has reached such a level that they are considering declaring more than twenty candidates for their party
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki somvaar baliya main hone vaali suheldev bhartiya samaaj party kii sabhi main in pratyaashiyon ke naam ghoshit kiye ja sakate hai
 Not only this, Omprakash Rajbhar, who is holding the charge of ministerial position in the Yogi government, can also resign

 ’’ Taslima (54) said in her address at the 'india Ideas Conclave 2016' here, "I have been living in exile since 1994

 '' uttar pradesh main apni duubati naiya ko paar lagane ke liye bijepi ne yuva or tej-tarraar varun gandhi kaa sahaara liya he
 He is more sedate than ever and is talking about Sarvajan, leaving the Hindutva rest
 ek may ko upi ke bareli shahar se 19 kimi dur devachara tak bareli-mathura state hive ke donon ore lageen kareeb 300 adamkad hordingon ne swabhimaan raily main shirkat karne pahunche logon kaa parichay us shaks se karaayaa, jise bijepi ne soobe main apni duubati naav ke khewanhaar ke rup main aage kiya he
 He is 33-year-old Varun Gandhi, BJP national general secretary and MP from Pilibhit
 varun gandhi jaise hi bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh ke saath pahunchate hai, bheed main naaraa gunjane lagata he, ''upi kaa mukhyamantri kaisaa ho? varun gandhi jaisaa ho
 "the crowd then shouts slogan," How should the leader of the country, be like Rajnath Singh
 ”ram janmabhumi andolan ke alambardaar netaaon kii bujurg ho rahi jamaat upi main party main nai jaan nahin daal paa rahi he
 In such a situation, BJP has played political stakes by advancing Varun Gandhi as a new face
 unako aage kar bijepi ne soobe ke yuva matadaataaon ke bich paith banane kii jang ko samaajawaadee party ke pradesh adhyaksh or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath trikoniya banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 If the BJP has changed, then Varun is also struggling to come out of the Hindutva image in view of the need of politics
 bareli main swabhimaan raily main rajnath singh main purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii chhavi dikhne kii baat kahkar varun ne sanket de diya ki bhale hi aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko bijepi main aage karne par manthan chal rahaa he, lekin unka jhukaav nirvivaad chhavi vaale netaa kii taraf hi he
 For a court acquitted of charges of making inflammatory speeches in his parliamentary constituency Pilibhit during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, there cannot be a better chance for Varun to get out of his fire brand image
 agle loksabhaa chunaav main samaajawaadee party ke pradesh adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii tarah party main varun ko aage kiye jane par pradesh bijepi adhyaksh dow
 Laxmikant Vajpayee says, "varun Gandhi's mind is made up of the demand of the time and also of the party
 saath chalane main hi bhalaai he
 Varun Gandhi, the son of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's younger son Sanjay Gandhi, has inherited politics
 isaki pehali jhalak tab dikhi, jab ve 2001 main landan skool of iconomics main padhai ke dauraan 'secretary of student council’ pad par nirvaachit hone vaale pehle bhartiya bane
 After completing his studies in 2004, Varun Gandhi joined the BJP following in the footsteps of his mother and BJP MP from Amla, Maneka Gandhi and became the youngest member to join the party's national executive at the age of 24
 iske baad ve sabase kam umr ke rashtriya sachiv or is saal march main bijepi ke sabase kam umr ke rashtriya mahasachiv bane
 After offering a place in the organization, the BJP offered Varun a big position in the National Youth Front in 2004 and 2007, but both times he turned it down
 varun bagaiyr chunaav jite koi pad lene ko taiyaar nahin the
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, when Varun's mother and former Pilibhit MP Maneka Gandhi chose Amla, the next seat for her new parliamentary constituency, BJP fielded Varun from Pilibhit
 varun ne yah seat 2,81,501 voton se jiti jo sabhi bijepi saansadon main jeet kaa sabase bada antar tha
 Just before the last assembly election in UP, Varun came under attack from the leaders of the state when he publicly stated that the party did not win more than 50 seats in UP
 haalanki varun un sabhi 14 siton par ummidavaaron ko jitaane main kaamyaab ho gaye the, jahaan unhone prachaar kiya tha
 Apart from this, the party gave the assembly ticket to 32 people at Varun's behest, in which 24 won
 varun ke behad kareebi ek netaa bataate hai ki purv rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne sangh parivaar main varun kii pairvi kii thi
 In 2012, after Ravi Shankar Prasad became deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, Gadkari wanted to seat Varun Gandhi for the post of national general secretary, but Varun refused because of a few months' time remaining in the formation of the new executive
 rajnath singh ne rashtriya adhyaksh banane ke baad bhale hi varun ko rashtriya mahasachiv banaaya, lekin iske asli 'architect’ gadakari hi hai
 Political analyst Surendra Singh says of the prospects of this young leader, "the BJP, which is struggling with a lack of influential publicity in the state, has played a big bet by advancing Varun Gandhi
 agar 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main varun pradesh main bijepi kii siton main khaasaa ijapha karaane main kaamyaab ho gaye to 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav kii kaman bhi unheen ke haathon saunpi ja sakati he
 ”as MP in Pilibhit Lok Sabha constituency, some of Varun’s new works have become extremely popular among the public
 unke kareebi or pilibhit main bijepi ke purv jiladhyaksh hardwari laal bataate hai, ''saansad nidhi ke kaaryon main thekedaaron kii manamaani rokane ke liye varun gandhi ne sarkari thekedaaron ke saath 5-10 logon kii mandali banaai jo nirmaan kaaryon kii nigaraanee karti thi
 Apart from this, eight ambulances were collected by collecting funds in Pilibhit parliamentary constituency, which reach the hospital to the patients without money in villages and towns
 ” pilibhit main lokapriy hone ke baavjood charchaa he ki varun gandhi aglaa loksabhaa chunaav sultanpur se ladenge
 Maneka Gandhi from Pilibhit and Dharmendra Kashyap from Amla will contest
 bijepi main shaamil hone se pehle kashyap sapa main the
 Varun's decision to contest from Sultanpur is not sudden
 ve pichley saadhe teen saal se isaki taiyaari kar rahe the
 Varun indicated this by holding a large gathering in Sultanpur on December 20, 2009, within eight months of winning the Pilibhit Lok Sabha elections in 2009
 is sabha main unhen sunne umadi bheed se bane maahaul ke baad varun ne yahaan apni sambhaavnaaen talashne ke liye apane pratinidhiyon or surveykshan agenciyon kaa sahaara liya
 Through the positive feedback received from him, Varun has been focusing on Sultanpur Lok Sabha constituency for the last six months
 sultanpur se varun gandhi ke chunaav ladgaye ko padosi jile raibareli se saansad or congress kii rashtriya adhyaksh sonia gandhi or amethi se saansad rahul gandhi kii gheraabandi ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Varun Gandhi will start his election campaign from this Lok Sabha constituency by holding a big rally in Sultanpur on 16 May
 sultanpur sansadeey kshetra main brahmanon or thakuron ke bich varchasv kii jang chalati rahati he
 Varun is trying to bridge the gap between these two camps and keep them with him
 16 may kii raily main jahaan sultanpur ke kuch pramukh thakur netaaon ko party main shaamil karaane kii taiyaari he, vahiin bijepi ke purv rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari ko brahman voton ko prabhavit karne ke liye bulaayaa ja rahaa he
 Varun may have put forward the party as a new face, but some challenges are facing him
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai ki varun lagaataar varisht netaaon kii upeksha kar party ke bheetar samanaantar sanghathan chalaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 On May 1, during the Swabhiman rally in Bareilly, not paying any attention to Santosh Gangwar, who has been a six-time MP from here, has come to the notice of the experienced leaders of the party
 lekin maamla sirf itnaa hi nahin he
 Varun may have got relief from the court in a case involving inflammatory Hindutva speech, but he will have to go a long distance to increase his penetration and acceptance among all sections of society
 varun kaa sultanpur se chunaav ladgaye kaa faisla achaanak nahin he
 He indicated this by holding a big meeting in Sultanpur in 2009
 ve saadhe teen saal se isaki taiyaari kar rahe the

 yah 2003 kii baat he
 Me and Lavish Bhandari joined India Today for ranking based on annual performance of various states of the country
 ise ''rajyon kii dasha-disha" naam diya gaya
 It has been a successful experiment, under which an annual issue has been focused on the state of the states and a series of awards has also been organized
 lekin ab isamen thodaa badlaav kiya gaya he
 In the beginning, it often faced resentment and criticism from states that did not receive high rankings
 hamen tab saraahna ke bajaae gussa jhelana padataa tha, khaskar jab ham kuch aisi tippanee karte the, ''aadhe se adhik rajya ausat se neeche hai
 "we kept learning and we improved ourselves and then said," Half the states are above average
 " dhire-dhire hamaare taur-tareeke ko sweekruti milane lagi
 States account for 90 to 95 percent of the country's national income, with some difference from year to year
 yani ''mek in india" dilli main nahin, rajyon main hota he
 Most of the cases of market related reforms are included in the list of states or concurrent list of Seventh Schedule
 rajya ab vittiya riyaayaton ke maamle main nahin, balki prashasan or bhautik tathaa saamaajik buniyadi dhaanche ke maamle main hode karte hai or unhen aisa karnaa bhi chahie
 They compete to attract investment and human resources
 ve vittiya or maanav sansadhano ko kaayam rakhane ke liye pratispardhaa karte hai
 It is generally argued that India has been highly centralized
 yah kendrikrut tha, kyonki iske peeche aupniveshak kaaran the
 Even after attaining independence, it remained more centralized, due to planning reasons
 kai aayogon ne apni report main iskaa zikr bhi kiya he
 The current government has begun to reduce this over-centralization in an institutional manner
 chaudaaven vitt ayog kii siforeeshon ko sweekruti mil chuki he
 Groups of chief ministers are shaping up to centrally sponsored schemes
 jiesti, smart city or anya yojanaon main rajyon kii shirkat rahi he
 There is little talk of non-equality in financial matters
 gaiyr-vittiya maamalon main nirnay-prakriya ke vikendrikaran se sambandhit muddon par khaasaa jor he
 In fact it is seen more only in the states
 rajyon main, khaskar bade rajyon main kaaphi vividhta hoti he
 Therefore, there is talk of taking the decision making process down to the district level, even to the block and panchayat level
 main samajhataa hum ki nagarpalika or gram panchayaton ko ahmiyat dene ke saath ham is vikendrikaran kii ore bhi mude hai
 The ranking of states has expanded
 is pratispardhi maahaul main ve yah jaanane ke vaazib strot hai ki koi rajya duusare rajyon kii tulana main kaisaa pradarshan karata he or samay ke saath uskaa pradarshan kaisaa hota he
 Many times, such studies record some good things that other states can expect to learn and replicate it
 darasal in adhyayanon main aksar bhinnataayen hoti hai
 Some such studies assess states as investment destinations, others assess them on the basis of human development or their social progress
 kuch akalan is aadhaar par bhi hote hai ki rajya rahane laayak he yaa nahin
 Each such study has its own limitations and its own trends, as was also the case in the direction of states
 haalanki tamaam adhyayanon main jab koi rajya acha pradarshan nahin karata to, saaf sandesh jaataa he
 About fifty percent of capital is now generated in the states
 chaudaaven vitt ayog kii sifarish ke baad rajya or gram sabha tak adhikaron kaa hastantaran hua he
 However, the results are not always directly in line with people's expectations, and old issues such as underdeveloped transport mechanisms persist
 aise main logon kii aakanksha or prashasan kii kshamta ke moolyankan kaa swaagat hona chahie or yah vaanchit bhi he
 Of course, people can punish the incumbent government with their vote for malfunctioning
 darasal ''kaamkaaj" itnaa vyapak shabd he ki kuch aankadon ko jodakar hi use thik-thik samajha ja saktaa he
 Since 2003, "state's direction" survey has been doing this
 (lekhak pradhanmantri kii aarthik salaahkaar parishad ke adhyaksh or niti ayog ke sadsy hai

 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki is bare main ek vidheyak sansad ke monsoon satr main aage badhaayaa jaayegaa
 The Prime Minister said that there is a lack of overall vision about the development plans of cities
 shaharon kaa vistaar vahaan ke prashaasak nahin balki builder karte hai
 The image of the unwanted-builder lobby is not good in our country
 modi ne guuruuvaar ko yahaan shahari vikaas se judi teen yojanaon kii shuruyaat ke avasar par ye baaten kahin
 He said that his government is very sensitive to consumer protection
 ek garib aadmi apnipuri bachat ko makaan kharidne main laga detaahai, lekin jab uske saath dhokhaa hota he to vah sab kuch ganvaa baithta he
 a bill has been introduced in Parliament to save such poor and small consumers

 Despite the bjp's new president Nitin Gadkari's invitation to return to the party, former UP Chief Minister Kalyan Singh, who was once considered among the party's stalwarts, is determined to set up his new party next month and is busy completing the formalities required for it
 
 kalyaan singh ne bataaya, ‘‘hamane nayi party ke panjikaran ke liye guuruuvaar ko hi chunaav ayog main jaruri sabhi dastavej daakhil kar diye hai or paanch janvari ko lakhanu main party ke gathan kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa kar di jaayegi
 He said that his supporters, who have been holding meetings all over the state since a month, are determined to form a new party and have taken a final decision in this regard
 singh ne kaha, ‘‘meraa ab kisi anya dal main shaamil hone kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta or nayi party kaa gathan or use majboot karnaa mere jivan kaa antim nirnay he
 Refusing to comment on the invite for a refund in the BJP, Singh said he had no idea to return to the BJP and now aims to work independently by strengthening the new party
 bhaajapa ke adhyaksh pad par gadakari kii niyukti ke bare main singh ne kaha ki abhi to vah adhyaksh bane hi he
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to make any comments right now
 unhone yah jarur kaha ki uttar pradesh main baharhaal vibhinn kaarnon se kam se kam 15 varshon tak bhaajapa kaa koi bhavishya dikhaai nahin padataa
 Singh said that the future of Samajwadi Party was also bleak and said that now it seems difficult for him to win the trust of Muslim voters, with whose support the party emerged as a force in the politics of the state
 unhone kaha ki mulaayam singh yadav ko musalamaanon kaa samarthan pradesh main bhaajapa kii badhati takat ke kaaran pratikriya kaa parinaam tha or ab jab bhaajapa hi kamjor ho gayi he to muslim unka saath de vah kaaran hi nahin bachaa
 Singh also said that now that the days of the rise of the Congress are seen to be returning, Muslims have started to see an alternative
 ullekhneey he ki 1999 main pehali baar bhaajapa chhodane ke baad kalyaan singh ne apni alag party bana lee thi, lekin 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle ve apni party ke saath bhaajapa main pun: shaamil ho gayi the
 The BJP contested the 2007 assembly elections under his leadership
 is saal loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle unhone ek baar phir bhaajapa chhod di or sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav se dosti kar lee, lekin chunaav main sapa haar gayi
 Along with this, the petitions filed against Madhya Pradesh Governor Ram Naresh Yadav will also be heard
 do alag alag yachikaayen daakhil ki gai hai
 The first demands that the governor should be removed with immediate effect as his role in the Vyapam scam case is questionable
 duusari yachika main hai court ke us aadesh ko chunauti di gai he jisamen hai court ne unke kilaaf darj FIR ko radd kar diya tha
 Here, on the request of Shivraj Singh Chauhan to conduct a CBI inquiry into the Vyapam scam, the High Court refused to take any decision
 ye kehete hue ki maamla supreme court main he- uske daayre se baahar he
 Here the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on this issue on Thursday
 lekin usase pehle hi agrim jamaanat ke maamle sun rahi supreme court kii dabl bench ne suzav diya he ki vyaapman ke jamaanat maamalon kii sunwaayee ke liye special bench honi chahie
 It is clear that the double bench has indicated in a way that Vyapam scam is not a common case
 isi ke saath ab congress or anya logon kii supreme court kii nigaraanee main sibiai jaanch kii maang ko or majbootee mili he
 It will now be clear on Thursday whether the CBI probe into Vyapam is approved or not, and whether the Supreme Court monitors it
 ullekhneey he ki mangalvaar ko madhya pradesh sarkaar kii ore se hoicourt main ek apil daayar kii gai thi
 In this appeal, it was requested by the government that the CBI should be allowed to investigate the case of Vyapam
 tippaniyan In a press conference on Tuesday itself, Chief Minister Chauhan had said that the STF is investigating the case under the supervision of the High Court and without the permission of the High Court, the government cannot recommend a CBI inquiry
 unhone kaha ki hoicourt estf kii jaanch se santusht tha or pehle bhi sibiai jaanch kii apil ko khaarij kar chukaa tha
 Chauhan had said that the Supreme Court also expressed satisfaction over the investigation
 vahiin, vipakshi dal is maamle main supreme court kii nigaraanee main sibiai jaanch kii maang kar rahe the
 The case was further heated up after the death of around 40 people related to the scam
 idhar vyaapman ghotaale kii sibiai jaanch karaane kii shivaraj singh chouhan kii guzarish par hycourt ne koi faisalaa lene se inkaar kar diya
 Saying that the matter is in the Supreme Court - is outside its purview
 idhar supreme court main guuruuvaar ko is masale par sunwaayee honi he
 But before that, the double bench of the Supreme Court, which is hearing the cases of anticipatory bail, has suggested that there should be a special bench for hearing the bail cases of Vyapam
 saaf he ki dabl bench ne ek tarah se ishaara kiya he ki vyaapman ghotaalaa aam maamla nahin he
 With this, the demand for a CBI inquiry under the supervision of the Supreme Court by the Congress and others has been further strengthened
 ab guuruuvaar ko saaf hoga ki vyaapman kii sibiai jaanch manzur hoti he yaa nahin, or supreme court isaki nigaraanee karata he yaa nahin
 It is noteworthy that on Tuesday, an appeal was filed in the High Court on behalf of the Government of Madhya Pradesh
 is apil main sarkaar kii ore se yah guzarish kii gai thi ki vyaapman maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karwaane kii ijaajat di jaae
 The comments mangalvaar ko hi ek samvaadadaataat sammelan main mukhyamantri chouhan ne kaha tha ki is maamle kii jaanch hoicourt kii nigaraanee main estf kar rahi he or bina hoicourt kii ijaajat ke sarkaar sibiai jaanch kii sifarish nahin kar sakati
 He said that the High Court was satisfied with the STF investigation and had earlier rejected the appeal of the CBI probe
 chouhan ne bataaya tha ki supreme court ne bhi jaanch par santushti jataai thi
 At the same time, opposition parties were demanding a CBI probe in this case under the supervision of the Supreme Court

 On Tuesday, Head Constable Ramashankar Yadav was cremated with full respect in Bhopal
 ramashankar yadav upi ke baliya ke rahane vaale the, magar inkaa parivaar bhopal main hi bas gaya tha
 Children have also grown up here
 ramashankar yadav ne bhopal central jail ke peeche ahilya nagar main apana makaan banaaya
 It was here that her daughter Sonia Yadav was married on 9 December
 ramashankar yadav ke do bete hai
 Elder son Havildar Shambhunath is 36-37 years old, who is in Assam
 chota betaa lansnayak prabhunath hisar main tainaan he
 Both sons are married, but the family is not in a position to decide whether the daughter will get married on December 9 or postpone it
 sari taiyaariyaan lagbhag antim charan main hi thim
 Ramashankar Yadav was posted as the Chief Warder in the jail
 hindi main is pad ko pradhan prahari kaha jaataa he
 Ramashankar Yadav's duty was only in a cell with extreme security
 diwali kii raat central jail se faraar hue aatank ke maamalon ke aath aropiyon ne unki hatya kar di thi
 Many of the jail staff in Ahilya Nagar have made their home
 hamaare sahyogi siddharth ranjan das or nita sharma se parivaar ke sadasyon ne baatcheet main bataaya ki sharir par chot ke nishaan bataate hai ki ramashankar yadav ne fite kiya tha
 The son has said that his father's murder should be investigated
 bete kaa bhi sawaal he ki yah baat clear honi chahie ki pita kii hatya kar ve kaise bhaag nikle
 Three types of questions are arising in this whole matter
 pehla sawaal ye he ki ramashankar yadav kii hatya kaise ho gai, baaki surakshakarmiyon ne kya kiya, kya unka dhyaan bilkul hi ramashankar par nahin gaya
 The second question is how the eight accused in the terror case ran away and the third question is about the encounter
 ahilya nagar jahaan ramashankar yadav kaa ghar he, vahaan ramashankar yadav ko rajkeey sammaan ke saath antim vidaai di gai
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh also reached to pay the last tribute
 unhone ahilya nagar kaa naam ramashankar nagar karne kaa elaan kiya he
 One million rupees as honor money and daughter is offered a government job
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne bhi shav ko uthaaya
 After his departure, recently the local legislator Vishwas Narang, who became a minister, shouldered Ramashankar Yadav and went to the crematorium
 police ke adhikari bhi maujuud the
 The Chief Minister is saying that there should be no question
 log ramashankar yadav ke liye kam bol rahe hai, in aatankwaadiyon ke liye kyon zyaada bol rahe hai
 Another soldier Chandan Ahirwar was also reported to be injured along with Ramashankar Yadav
 inke bare main pataa chalaa he ki bhaagane vaale pratibandhit simi kaaryakartaaon ne rassi se baandh kar cell main daal diya tha
 Our colleague Srinivasan Jain also tried to talk to Chandan Ahirwar ji, Chandan is shocked, told that he did not have a weapon
 parivaaravaalon ne bataaya ki 58 saal ke ramashankar yadav aatankwaadi cell main tainaat the or dopaher se madhya raatri kii duty par the
 There are many cells within a barrack
 har cell kaa apana daravaaza hota he
 After that there is a door outside the barrack which is also locked
 pehla sawaal isi ko lekar uthaa ki do darvaaze tod kar koi kaise baahar aa gaya
 Can the wooden key or spoon key be right? hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain ne head jailer es
 K
 es
 Also talked to Bhadoria
 bhopal central jail ai es o pramanit jail he tab bhi iske mukhiya kah rahe hai ki simi ke itane log band rahenge to jail brake kii ghatana ho sakati he
 Did he say this to the government in writing? police se lekar head jailer tak sabhi kah rahe hai ki sabhi alag-alag cell main the
 On Monday, IG Yogesh Chaudhary also said that all the escaped prisoners were kept in separate barracks, which were in different sectors
 jail kii teen deevaaron ko samajhnaa zaruri he
 The first wall was seventy to eighty feet away from the cell where the terrorists are kept
 ye diwaar kareeb 35 feet oonchi thi
 After this, the second wall is 20 feet
 sabase baahar kii diwaar jise ham boundry waal kehete hai, wo chaar yaa paanch feet kii hoti he
 The outer boundary wall is two km
 jail ke andar 42 sisitivi camere lage hai
 These terror accused were kept in the b and c section, whose four CCTV cameras were not working
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma kaa kahana he ki inase kuch bhi nahin mila he
 It is not clear now that a barrack that contains many cells, there are only four CCTV cameras or more
 jailer ne bataaya ki jail main 5-6 camere 360 degree par ghoomane vaale hai
 Did all eight of them survive? is ghatana ne jail ke system ko expos kiya he isliye bhaage jane ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai ki koi bina kisi pratirodh ke itani badi sankhya main kaise bhaag gaya, wo bhi ek jawan kii hatya karke
 The prison minister, in a conversation with Srinivasan Jain, admitted that she had a responsibility, but she became the jail minister a month and a half ago
 ye baat bhi thik he
 The removal of the minister does not answer the questions, because the jail has not been built a month and a half ago
 sisitivi kaa footage ab bhaagane waalon se zyada ramashankar kii hatya kaa pataa lagane ke liye zyaada zaruri ho jaataa he, kyonki agar ramashankar kii shahadat ke naam par sawaalon ko sandigdh kiya ja rahaa he to kam se kam unki hatya kaa maamla zarur khulanaa chahie
 Jail police and state police are two separate entities
 madhya pradesh ke grahamantri ne somvaar ko 'prime time' main bataaya tha ki 12 se 3 baje ke bich ghatana hui or saadhe chaar baje ke kareeb rajya police ko soochna mili
 There was a delay of one and a half hours
 bhaagane waalon ke paas itane hathiyaar kaise aa gaye, agar hathiyaar aae to bhaagane ke liye gaadi bhi mil sakati thi, or jail se sate haive kii taraf bhi dhyaan ja saktaa tha
 Our colleague Nita Sharma, inspecting the location of the encounter, showed that there is a hut, a little away from the peak, where earlier they were being told to be hidden
 raat andhere kisi surakshasmarmi kii hatya kar bhaagega to yahaan is jhopadi main kyon chhipega
 He has also escaped from Khandwa jail, the first of the three to escape
 wo kaaphi lambey samay tak faraar rahe the or kathith rup se kai tarah kii aapraadhik or aatanki gatividhiyon main in par shaamil rahane kaa aarope bhi laga
 The murder of Ramashankar Yadav, the lapse of the jail administration comes after these two questions, the question of the encounter
 kai tarah ke aae bayanon or video footage ne bhi sawaal kii gunzaaish paidaa kii he
 a statement came that he was about to run away from jail
 jab ye pataa tha ki vaardaat karne vaale the to kya ye pataa nahin laga ki ye jail se bhi bhaagane vaale the
 It is also true that if they did not have an encounter, or were not caught, then the condition of the Madhya Pradesh police and security agencies would have deteriorated today
 lekin is tarah se encounter kaa hona aap chahen bhi to sawaalon se nahin batch sakate hai
 Srinivasan Jain also spoke to IG Yogesh Chaudhary
 encounter ke choubees ghante baad bhi ai ji yogesh choudhary kah rahe hai ki jo teen jawan dhardaar hathiyaar se ghayal hue hai
 On the part of absconding prisoners, bullets were fired towards the police
 phir dhardaar hathiyaar yani sharp vepan se jawan kaise ghayal ho gaye
 Was this encounter just getting close
 tej hathiyaar se ghayal to tabhi hoga jab donon paksh ek duusare ke kareeb hon
 Sarpanch of the village Mohan Singh Meena also spoke to the news agency ANI
 meena ke jawaab se maaloom padataa he ki ve pathar chalaa rahe the
 Police say that they had indigenous guns, but the three soldiers who were injured in the encounter were injured with sharp weapons
 kya pathar bhi sharp vepan main gina jaataa he
 Many people are calling the eight people killed as terrorists
 hamen patrakarita main sikhaaya gaya he ki sabit hone se pehle tak aaropee yaa kathith rup se aaropee likhnaa chahie
 But everyone is saying terrorists, while no one is punished
 ateet main kai aise maamle hue hai, jinamein aatank ke maamle main log das bees saal tak jail main band rahe, unhen aatankwaadi hi kaha jaataa rahaa magar unke khilaaf koi saboot nahin mila or ve supreme court se bari ho gaye
 a book was published by the Jamia Teachers' Solidarity Association after compiling the story of 24 such people acquitted from all the courts on charges of terror
 kitaab kaa naam he Framed Dammed Aquitted
 There is also a media clipping behind every case acquitted in this book, in which you can see how the media used to say terrorist during arrest
 media hi nahin, rishtedaar, dost-yaar sab duuri bana lete hai
 You are seeing two pictures right now on our screen
 ek tasviir us noujvaan kii he, jab wo 20 saal tha yani 1994 kii
 a photo 31 May 2016, now age is 43 years
 in do tasveeron ke bich is shaks kii zindagi ke 8150 din jail main guzare hai
 One day after spending 23 years in jail, the Supreme Court said that the statements based on which Nisar had to undergo life imprisonment are not sufficient as evidence
 jail se baahar aakar nisaar ko laga ki ab wo sirf ek zindaa laash kii tarah bachaa hua he
 Abba had left this world when he came home after being in jail for 23 years without committing any crime
 apni ammi se lipta to ro padaa, shaayad bahut hi royaa hoga
 Police in several states kept Nisar in jail for 23 years by making him accused in several bomb blasts, but the Supreme Court said that the confessional statement is not sufficient evidence
 ab aap darshak tay karen
 It is being asked why some people or some journalists are not calling the runaway SIMI workers of Bhopal as terrorists
 is sawaal kaa jawaab diya janaa chahie or poochne vaale bilkul sahi sawaal puch rahe hai
 i make a small effort
 soshal media par bhaddi gaaliyon ke saath sawaal poochne vaale kah rahe hai ki kya inhen aatankwaadi isliye nahin kaha ja rahaa he kyonki ye musalmaan hai
 Most of the channels and newspapers are writing terrorists, so this complaint is not valid
 shikaayat ye honi chahie ki kyon aatankwaadi likh rahe hai
 
 
 But well nisaar kaa hi cese lijie
 i believe on you
 aap nisaar kii kahani jaanakar ye nahin kahenge ki musalmaan ke saath aisa nahin hona chahie
 They will say that this should not happen to any Indian, so why are those who are being accused in the Bhopal case insist on calling them terrorists
 haa, wo aatank ke aarope main band zarur hai or ek sipaahi kii hatya karne kaa bhi aarope laga he
 a Union Minister has also spoken in sympathy to them due to religion
 encounter ne sabko sataaya he
 Even Hindus, Sikhs, Adivasis too and who knows whom
 haal hi main indian express main ek khabar chhapi thi
 (IAS Officer Kinjal) lakhanu se manish sahu kii ye story he
 He is an IAS officer Kinjal, who was the DM of Bahraich at the time of writing the story
 kinjal ke pita ke pi singh upi police main di es pi the
 When she was five years old, her father was confronted by the police
 encounter sabit karne ke liye ke pi singh ke saath saath gaanv ke 12 logon ko maar diya
 Betty fought this case for 31 years
 is bich wo ai e es afasar ban gai
 But how could the father, who was killed in an encounter in the company of criminals, tolerate it
 31 saal baad kahani ye nikali ki ke pi singh khud do aparaadhiyon ko pakadaney gaye the, lekin peeche khadey sab inspector aar bi saroj ne unki chaati main goli utaar di
 Inspector Saroj was sentenced to life imprisonment
 12 police adhikariyon ko sazaa hui
 Among them were Hindus as well as Muslims
 isliye police ke encounter par sawaal uthte rahe hai
 It has nothing to do with Hindus or Muslims
 tippaniyan This does not mean that the criminals who have escaped from Bhopal jail are innocent
 jab tak aarope sabit nahin hota tab tak ve nirdosh bhi nahin hai, lekin encounter par sawaal kyon nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 How can he run out of jail, why cannot there be a question, how can Ramashankar Yadav be killed, why cannot it be questioned
 hamane yah bhi dekha ki maalegaanv bam dhamaake kii aaropee sadhvi pragna singh thakur ke bare main media ne kaise likhaa he
 The accused writes or the terrorist writes
 ham saare akhabaaron ko to khangaal nahin sake lekin indian express kii heading main sidhe puraa naam likhaa he
 The accused is not written in the heading, the terrorist is also not written
 behatar he ki aap sarkaar or adaalat milakar tay kar len ki ab se police jise bhi pakad legi, wo chor, daaku, hatyara yaa aatankwaadi kehalaayegaa
 Accused or alleged accused shall not be written
 sabake liye ye niyam ban janaa chahie
 Until this rule is made, i have no problem in writing the accused
 shaayad nasir yaa ai e es afasar kinjal ko bhi dikkat nahin hogi
 The son also has a question that it should be clear how he escaped after killing the father
 is puure maamle main teen prakaar ke sawaal uth rahe hai
 The first question is how Ramashankar Yadav was killed, what did the rest of the security personnel do, did he not focus on Ramashankar at all
 doosraa sawaal ye he ki aatank ke maamle ke aath aaropee kaise bhaag gaye or teesraa sawaal encounter ko lekar uth rahaa he
 At Ahalya Nagar, where Ramashankar Yadav is home, Ramashankar Yadav was given a final farewell with state honors
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh bhi antim shradhanjali dene pahunche
 He has announced the name of Ahilya Nagar as Ramashankar Nagar
 sammaan raashi ke rup main das lakh or beti ko sarkari naukari kii peshkash kii he
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan also picked up the body
 unke jane ke baad haal hi main mantri bane sthaneey vidhayak vishwaas naarang ne ramashankar yadav ko kandhaa diya or ve shmashaan ghat tak gaye
 Police officers were also present
 mukhyamantri kah rahe hai ki sawaal nahin hona chahie
 People are speaking less for Ramashankar Yadav, why are they speaking more for these terrorists
 ramashankar yadav ke saath ek or sipaahi chandan ahirwar ke bhi ghayal hone kii khabar ai thi
 It is learned that the banned SIMI activists who had run away were tied with rope and put in the cell
 hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain ne chandan ahirwar ji se bhi baat karne kaa prayaas kiya, chandan sadame main hai, bataaya ki unke paas hathiyaar nahin tha
 Family members said that 58-year-old Ramashankar Yadav was posted in the terrorist cell and was on midnight duty from noon
 ek barrack ke bheetar kai cell hote hai
 Every cell has its own door
 uske baad barrack ke baahar bhi ek daravaaza hota he jis par taala laga hota he
 The first question arose as to how someone came out after breaking two doors
 kya lakdi kii chaabi yaa chammach kii chaabi kii baat sahi ho sakati he
 Our colleague Srinivasan Jain, head jailer s
 ke
 s
 bhadauria se bhi baat kii
 Even though Bhopal Central Jail is an ISO certified jail, its chiefs are saying that jail break incident could happen if so many people of SIMI remain closed
 kya inhone sarkaar se yah baat likhit main kahi thi
 Everyone from the police to the head jailor are saying that all were in different cells
 somvaar ko aiji yogesh choudhary ne bhi kaha tha ki bhaagane vaale sabhi qaidiyon ko alag-alag barrack main rakhaa gaya tha, jo alag-alag sector main the
 It is important to understand the three walls of the prison
 jis cell main aatankwaadi rakhe jate hai, pehali diwaar usase sattar se assi feet dur thi
 This wall was about 35 feet high
 iske baad duusari diwaar 20 feet kii hoti he
 The outermost wall, which we call the boundary wall, is four or five feet long
 bahari charadivari kaa dayera do kimi he
 There are 42 CCTV cameras installed inside the jail
 aatank ke in aropiyon ko bi or si section main rakhaa gaya tha, jiske chaar sisitivi camere kaam nahin kar rahe the
 Our colleague Neeta Sharma says that nothing has been received from them
 ab yah saaf nahin he ki ek barrack jiske bheetar kai cell hote hai, vahaan chaar hi sisitivi camere hote hai yaa or bhi adhik hote hai
 The jailer said that 5-6 cameras are about to rotate at 360 degrees in the jail
 kya inase bhi aathon ke aathon batch gaye
 This incident has exposed the prison system, so questions are being raised about how someone ran away in such large numbers without any resistance, that too by killing a young man
 jail mantri ne shrinivasana jain ke saath baatcheet main mana ki unki zimmedaari banati he, lekin wo dedh maheenaa pehle jail mantri bani hai
 This is also true
 mantri ko hataa dene se sawaalon ke jawaab nahin mil jate hai, kyonki jail kaa nirmaan to dedh maheene pehle nahin hua he
 CCTV footage now becomes more important to detect the killing of Ramashankar than the escapees, because if the questions are being suspected in the name of Ramashankar's martyrdom, then at least his murder case must be opened
 jail kii police or rajya kii police do alag-alag sansthaaen hai
 The Home Minister of Madhya Pradesh had told in 'prime time' on Monday that the incident occurred between 12 and 3 pm and the state police received information around 4:30 pm
 dedh ghante kii deree hui
 How did the escapees get so many weapons, if the weapons came, they could get a vehicle to run, and could also pay attention to the highway adjacent to the jail
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma ne encounter kii jagah kaa muyna karte hue dikhaaya ki chotii se thodi dur ek jhopadi he vahaan par pehle ye chhipe hue bataaye ja rahe the
 Night will run away after killing a security personnel, so why hide here in this hut
 wo bhi inamen se teen bhaagane vaale pehle bhi khandwa jail se bhaag chuke hai
 He was absconding for a long time and was also accused of being involved in various criminal and terrorist activities
 ramashankar yadav kii hatya, jail prashasan kii chook in do sawaalon ke baad aata he, encounter kaa sawaal
 a variety of statements and video footage have also raised questions
 ek bayaan aayaa ki ye jail se bhagkar vaardaat karne vaale the
 When it was known that he was about to commit the crime, did it not come to know that he was also going to escape from jail
 yah baat bhi sahi he ki agar inkaa encounter nahin hota, yaa ye pakade nahin jate to aaj madhya pradesh police or suraksha agenciyon kii haalat karaab hoti
 But if you want to have an encounter in this way, then you cannot avoid questions
 shrinivasana jain ne ai ji yogesh choudhary se bhi baat kii
 Even twenty-four hours after the encounter, IG Yogesh Chaudhary is saying that three soldiers who were injured with sharp weapons
 faraar kaidiyon kii taraf se police kii ore goliyaan chalaai gayi
 Then how were the soldiers injured with sharp weapons
 kya ye encounter ekadam paas paas ho rahaa tha
 Wounded with a sharp weapon, only when both sides are close to each other
 gaanv ke sarpanch mohan singh meena ne bhi samachar agency e en ai se baat kii
 Meena's reply shows that he was stepping stones
 police kahati he ki unke paas desi bandooken thim, magar encounter main jo teen sipaahi ghayal hue hai wo dhardaar hathiyaar se ghayal hue hai
 Does the stone also count in the Sharp Weapon
 kai log maare gaye aath logon ko aatankwaadi kah rahe hai
 We have been taught in journalism that an accused or an alleged accused must be written until proven
 magar sab aatankwaadi kah rahe hai jabaki kisi ko sazaa nahin hui he
 There have been many cases in the past in which people have been kept in jail for ten or twenty years in the case of terror, they were called as terrorists but no evidence was found against them and they were acquitted by the Supreme Court
 aatank ke aarope main tamaam adaalaton se bari hue 24 aise logon kii kahani sankalit kar jamiya teachers solidarity association ne ek kitaab prakashit kii thi
 The name of the book is Framed Dammed Aquitted
 is kitaab main bari hue har cese ke peeche media kii cliping bhi he, jisamen aap dekh sakate hai ki giraftaar ke vakt media kaise aatankwaadi kehane lagata he
 Not only the media, relatives, friends or friends make all the distance
 aap hamaare screen par is vakt do tasviren dekh rahe hai
 One photo is of the young man, when he was 20 years old i
e
 1994
 ek tasviir 31 may 2016, ab umr he 43 saal
 Between these two pictures, 8150 days of this man's life have passed in jail
 23 saal jail main guzaarane ke baad ek din jab supreme court ne kaha ki jin bayanon ke aadhaar par nisaar ko aaajeevan karawas kii sazaa kaatani padi he wo saboot ke taur par paryaapt nahin hai
 Coming out of jail, Nisar felt that he was now left as a living corpse
 23 saal tak bagair kisi gunaah ke jail main rahane ke baad jab ghar aayaa to abba is duniya se ja chuke the
 She cried when she was wrapped with her mother, may have cried a lot
 kai rajyon kii police ne nisaar ko kai bam dhamaakon main aaropee banaakar 23 saal tak jail main rakhaa magar supreme court ne yahi kaha ki ikbaalia bayaan paryaapt rup se saboot nahin he
 Now you decide audience
 yah poocha ja rahaa he ki bhopal ke bhaage simi kaaryakartaaon ko kuch log yaa kuch patrkaar aatankwaadi kyon nahin kah rahe hai
 This question should be answered and the askers are asking exactly the right questions
 main chota sa prayaas karata hum
 On social media, people asking questions with vulgar abuses are asking whether they are being called terrorists because they are Muslims
 awwal to zyaadaatar channel or akhbaar aatankwaadi hi likh rahe hai, isliye ye shikaayat vaazib nahin he
 The complaint should be why terrorists are writing
 
 
 par kair
 Take the case of Nisar
 mujhe aap par yakeen he
 Knowing the story of Nisar, you will not say that this should not happen to a Muslim
 yahi kahenge ki kisi bhi bhartiya ke saath aisa nahin hona chahie, to bhopal maamle main jinhen aaropee kaha ja rahaa he, unhen aatanki kehane kii zid kyon hai
 Yes, they are definitely locked up on terror charges and also accused of killing a soldier
 ek kendriya mantri ne bhi ishaare main dharm ke kaaran inase sahanubhuti kii baat kahi he
 Encounter has persecuted everyone
 hindu ko bhi, sikh ko bhi, adivasee ko bhi or na jane kis-kis ko
 Recently there was a news in the Indian Express
 (iees afasar kinjal) This is the story of Manish Sahu from Lucknow
 ye ai e es adhikari kinjal hai, jo story likhe jane ke vakt baharich kii dm thi
 Kinjal's father KP Singh was a DSP in UP Police
 jab wo paanch saal kii thi tab uske pita ko police ke hi logon ne encounter kar diya
 KP Singh along with 12 people of the village were killed to prove the encounter
 31 saal tak beti ne ye mukadmaa ladaa
 Meanwhile, she became an IAS officer
 magar baap aparaadhiyon kii sangat main encounter main maaraa gaya, kaise bardaasht kar sakati thi
 After 31 years, the story came out that KP Singh himself went to apprehend the two criminals, but Sub Inspector RB Saroj, who was standing behind, shot him in his chest
 inspector saroj ko aaajeevan kaid kii sazaa hui
 12 police officers were punished
 inamen hindu bhi the or musalmaan bhi
 Therefore, questions have been raised on the police encounter
 iskaa hindu yaa musalmaan se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The comments iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki bhopal jail se bhaagane vaale apradhi nirdosh hai
 They are also not innocent until the charge is proved, but why the encounter cannot be questioned
 jail se kaise bhaage, kyon nahin sawaal ho saktaa, ramashankar yadav kii hatya kaise hui kyon nahin sawaal ho saktaa
 We have also seen how the media has written about Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, accused in the Malegaon bomb blast
 aaropee likhata he yaa aatankwaadi likhata he
 We could not research all the newspapers, but the full name is written directly in the heading of Indian Express
 heading main aaropee bhi nahin likhaa he, aatankwaadi bhi nahin likhaa he
 It is better that you decide with the government and the court together that from now on, whomever the police will catch will be called thieves, robbers, murderers or terrorists
 aaropee yaa kathith rup se aaropee nahin likhaa jayega
 These rules should be made for everyone
 jabatak ye niyam na ban jaae, mujhe aaropee likhane main koi dikkat nahin he
 Perhaps Nasir or IAS officer Kinjal will also not face any problem
 ahilya nagar jahaan ramashankar yadav kaa ghar he, vahaan ramashankar yadav ko rajkeey sammaan ke saath antim vidaai di gai
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh also reached to pay the last tribute
 unhone ahilya nagar kaa naam ramashankar nagar karne kaa elaan kiya he
 One million rupees as honor money and daughter is offered a government job
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne bhi shav ko uthaaya
 After his departure, recently the local legislator Vishwas Narang, who became a minister, shouldered Ramashankar Yadav and went to the crematorium
 police ke adhikari bhi maujuud the
 The Chief Minister is saying that there should be no question
 log ramashankar yadav ke liye kam bol rahe hai, in aatankwaadiyon ke liye kyon zyaada bol rahe hai
 Another soldier Chandan Ahirwar was also reported to be injured along with Ramashankar Yadav
 inke bare main pataa chalaa he ki bhaagane vaale pratibandhit simi kaaryakartaaon ne rassi se baandh kar cell main daal diya tha
 Our colleague Srinivasan Jain also tried to talk to Chandan Ahirwar ji, Chandan is shocked, told that he did not have a weapon
 parivaaravaalon ne bataaya ki 58 saal ke ramashankar yadav aatankwaadi cell main tainaat the or dopaher se madhya raatri kii duty par the
 There are many cells within a barrack
 har cell kaa apana daravaaza hota he
 After that there is a door outside the barrack which is also locked

 On Monday, IG Yogesh Chaudhary also said that all the escaped prisoners were kept in separate barracks, which were in different sectors
 jail kii teen deevaaron ko samajhnaa zaruri he
 The first wall was seventy to eighty feet away from the cell where the terrorists are kept
 ye diwaar kareeb 35 feet oonchi thi
 After this, the second wall is 20 feet
 sabase baahar kii diwaar jise ham boundry waal kehete hai, wo chaar yaa paanch feet kii hoti he
 The outer boundary wall is two km
 jail ke andar 42 sisitivi camere lage hai
 These terror accused were kept in the b and c section, whose four CCTV cameras were not working
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma kaa kahana he ki inase kuch bhi nahin mila he
 It is not clear now that a barrack that contains many cells, there are only four CCTV cameras or more
 jailer ne bataaya ki jail main 5-6 camere 360 degree par ghoomane vaale hai
 Did all eight of them survive? is ghatana ne jail ke system ko expos kiya he isliye bhaage jane ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai ki koi bina kisi pratirodh ke itani badi sankhya main kaise bhaag gaya, wo bhi ek jawan kii hatya karke
 The prison minister, in a conversation with Srinivasan Jain, admitted that she had a responsibility, but she became the jail minister a month and a half ago
 ye baat bhi thik he
 The removal of the minister does not answer the questions, because the jail has not been built a month and a half ago
 sisitivi kaa footage ab bhaagane waalon se zyada ramashankar kii hatya kaa pataa lagane ke liye zyaada zaruri ho jaataa he, kyonki agar ramashankar kii shahadat ke naam par sawaalon ko sandigdh kiya ja rahaa he to kam se kam unki hatya kaa maamla zarur khulanaa chahie
 Jail police and state police are two separate entities
 madhya pradesh ke grahamantri ne somvaar ko 'prime time' main bataaya tha ki 12 se 3 baje ke bich ghatana hui or saadhe chaar baje ke kareeb rajya police ko soochna mili
 There was a delay of one and a half hours
 bhaagane waalon ke paas itane hathiyaar kaise aa gaye, agar hathiyaar aae to bhaagane ke liye gaadi bhi mil sakati thi, or jail se sate haive kii taraf bhi dhyaan ja saktaa tha
 Our colleague Nita Sharma, inspecting the location of the encounter, showed that there is a hut, a little away from the peak, where earlier they were being told to be hidden
 raat andhere kisi surakshasmarmi kii hatya kar bhaagega to yahaan is jhopadi main kyon chhipega
 He has also escaped from Khandwa jail, the first of the three to escape
 wo kaaphi lambey samay tak faraar rahe the or kathith rup se kai tarah kii aapraadhik or aatanki gatividhiyon main in par shaamil rahane kaa aarope bhi laga
 The murder of Ramashankar Yadav, the lapse of the jail administration comes after these two questions, the question of the encounter
 kai tarah ke aae bayanon or video footage ne bhi sawaal kii gunzaaish paidaa kii he
 a statement came that he was about to run away from jail
 jab ye pataa tha ki vaardaat karne vaale the to kya ye pataa nahin laga ki ye jail se bhi bhaagane vaale the
 It is also true that if they did not have an encounter, or were not caught, then the condition of the Madhya Pradesh police and security agencies would have deteriorated today
 lekin is tarah se encounter kaa hona aap chahen bhi to sawaalon se nahin batch sakate hai
 Srinivasan Jain also spoke to IG Yogesh Chaudhary
 encounter ke choubees ghante baad bhi ai ji yogesh choudhary kah rahe hai ki jo teen jawan dhardaar hathiyaar se ghayal hue hai
 On the part of absconding prisoners, bullets were fired towards the police
 phir dhardaar hathiyaar yani sharp vepan se jawan kaise ghayal ho gaye
 Was this encounter just getting close
 tej hathiyaar se ghayal to tabhi hoga jab donon paksh ek duusare ke kareeb hon
 Sarpanch of the village Mohan Singh Meena also spoke to the news agency ANI
 meena ke jawaab se maaloom padataa he ki ve pathar chalaa rahe the
 Police say that they had indigenous guns, but the three soldiers who were injured in the encounter were injured with sharp weapons
 kya pathar bhi sharp vepan main gina jaataa he
 Many people are calling the eight people killed as terrorists
 hamen patrakarita main sikhaaya gaya he ki sabit hone se pehle tak aaropee yaa kathith rup se aaropee likhnaa chahie
 But everyone is saying terrorists, while no one is punished
 ateet main kai aise maamle hue hai, jinamein aatank ke maamle main log das bees saal tak jail main band rahe, unhen aatankwaadi hi kaha jaataa rahaa magar unke khilaaf koi saboot nahin mila or ve supreme court se bari ho gaye
 a book was published by the Jamia Teachers' Solidarity Association after compiling the story of 24 such people acquitted from all the courts on charges of terror
 kitaab kaa naam he Framed Dammed Aquitted
 There is also a media clipping behind every case acquitted in this book, in which you can see how the media used to say terrorist during arrest
 media hi nahin, rishtedaar, dost-yaar sab duuri bana lete hai
 You are seeing two pictures right now on our screen
 ek tasviir us noujvaan kii he, jab wo 20 saal tha yani 1994 kii
 a photo 31 May 2016, now age is 43 years
 in do tasveeron ke bich is shaks kii zindagi ke 8150 din jail main guzare hai
 One day after spending 23 years in jail, the Supreme Court said that the statements based on which Nisar had to undergo life imprisonment are not sufficient as evidence
 jail se baahar aakar nisaar ko laga ki ab wo sirf ek zindaa laash kii tarah bachaa hua he
 Abba had left this world when he came home after being in jail for 23 years without committing any crime
 apni ammi se lipta to ro padaa, shaayad bahut hi royaa hoga
 Police in several states kept Nisar in jail for 23 years by making him accused in several bomb blasts, but the Supreme Court said that the confessional statement is not sufficient evidence
 ab aap darshak tay karen
 It is being asked why some people or some journalists are not calling the runaway SIMI workers of Bhopal as terrorists
 is sawaal kaa jawaab diya janaa chahie or poochne vaale bilkul sahi sawaal puch rahe hai
 i make a small effort
 soshal media par bhaddi gaaliyon ke saath sawaal poochne vaale kah rahe hai ki kya inhen aatankwaadi isliye nahin kaha ja rahaa he kyonki ye musalmaan hai
 Most of the channels and newspapers are writing terrorists, so this complaint is not valid
 shikaayat ye honi chahie ki kyon aatankwaadi likh rahe hai
 
 
 But well nisaar kaa hi cese lijie
 i believe on you
 aap nisaar kii kahani jaanakar ye nahin kahenge ki musalmaan ke saath aisa nahin hona chahie
 They will say that this should not happen to any Indian, so why are those who are being accused in the Bhopal case insist on calling them terrorists
 haa, wo aatank ke aarope main band zarur hai or ek sipaahi kii hatya karne kaa bhi aarope laga he
 a Union Minister has also spoken in sympathy to them due to religion
 encounter ne sabko sataaya he
 Even Hindus, Sikhs, Adivasis too and who knows whom
 haal hi main indian express main ek khabar chhapi thi
 (IAS Officer Kinjal) lakhanu se manish sahu kii ye story he
 He is an IAS officer Kinjal, who was the DM of Bahraich at the time of writing the story
 kinjal ke pita ke pi singh upi police main di es pi the
 When she was five years old, her father was confronted by the police
 encounter sabit karne ke liye ke pi singh ke saath saath gaanv ke 12 logon ko maar diya
 Betty fought this case for 31 years
 is bich wo ai e es afasar ban gai
 But how could the father, who was killed in an encounter in the company of criminals, tolerate it
 31 saal baad kahani ye nikali ki ke pi singh khud do aparaadhiyon ko pakadaney gaye the, lekin peeche khadey sab inspector aar bi saroj ne unki chaati main goli utaar di
 Inspector Saroj was sentenced to life imprisonment
 12 police adhikariyon ko sazaa hui
 Among them were Hindus as well as Muslims
 isliye police ke encounter par sawaal uthte rahe hai
 It has nothing to do with Hindus or Muslims
 tippaniyan This does not mean that the criminals who have escaped from Bhopal jail are innocent
 jab tak aarope sabit nahin hota tab tak ve nirdosh bhi nahin hai, lekin encounter par sawaal kyon nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 How can he run out of jail, why cannot there be a question, how can Ramashankar Yadav be killed, why cannot it be questioned
 hamane yah bhi dekha ki maalegaanv bam dhamaake kii aaropee sadhvi pragna singh thakur ke bare main media ne kaise likhaa he
 The accused writes or the terrorist writes
 ham saare akhabaaron ko to khangaal nahin sake lekin indian express kii heading main sidhe puraa naam likhaa he
 The accused is not written in the heading, the terrorist is also not written
 behatar he ki aap sarkaar or adaalat milakar tay kar len ki ab se police jise bhi pakad legi, wo chor, daaku, hatyara yaa aatankwaadi kehalaayegaa
 Accused or alleged accused shall not be written
 sabake liye ye niyam ban janaa chahie
 Until this rule is made, i have no problem in writing the accused
 shaayad nasir yaa ai e es afasar kinjal ko bhi dikkat nahin hogi

 hamane yah bhi dekha ki maalegaanv bam dhamaake kii aaropee sadhvi pragna singh thakur ke bare main media ne kaise likhaa he
 The accused writes or the terrorist writes
 ham saare akhabaaron ko to khangaal nahin sake lekin indian express kii heading main sidhe puraa naam likhaa he
 The accused is not written in the heading, the terrorist is also not written
 behatar he ki aap sarkaar or adaalat milakar tay kar len ki ab se police jise bhi pakad legi, wo chor, daaku, hatyara yaa aatankwaadi kehalaayegaa
 Accused or alleged accused shall not be written
 sabake liye ye niyam ban janaa chahie
 Until this rule is made, i have no problem in writing the accused
 shaayad nasir yaa ai e es afasar kinjal ko bhi dikkat nahin hogi
 Family members said that 58-year-old Ramashankar Yadav was posted in the terrorist cell and was on midnight duty from noon
 ek barrack ke bheetar kai cell hote hai
 Every cell has its own door
 uske baad barrack ke baahar bhi ek daravaaza hota he jis par taala laga hota he
 The first question arose as to how someone came out after breaking two doors
 kya lakdi kii chaabi yaa chammach kii chaabi kii baat sahi ho sakati he
 Our colleague Srinivasan Jain, head jailer s
 ke
 s
 bhadauria se bhi baat kii
 Even though Bhopal Central Jail is an ISO certified jail, its chiefs are saying that jail break incident could happen if so many people of SIMI remain closed
 kya inhone sarkaar se yah baat likhit main kahi thi
 Everyone from the police to the head jailor are saying that all were in different cells
 somvaar ko aiji yogesh choudhary ne bhi kaha tha ki bhaagane vaale sabhi qaidiyon ko alag-alag barrack main rakhaa gaya tha, jo alag-alag sector main the
 It is important to understand the three walls of the prison
 jis cell main aatankwaadi rakhe jate hai, pehali diwaar usase sattar se assi feet dur thi
 This wall was about 35 feet high
 iske baad duusari diwaar 20 feet kii hoti he
 The outermost wall, which we call the boundary wall, is four or five feet long
 bahari charadivari kaa dayera do kimi he
 There are 42 CCTV cameras installed inside the jail
 aatank ke in aropiyon ko bi or si section main rakhaa gaya tha, jiske chaar sisitivi camere kaam nahin kar rahe the
 Our colleague Neeta Sharma says that nothing has been received from them
 ab yah saaf nahin he ki ek barrack jiske bheetar kai cell hote hai, vahaan chaar hi sisitivi camere hote hai yaa or bhi adhik hote hai
 The jailer said that 5-6 cameras are about to rotate at 360 degrees in the jail
 kya inase bhi aathon ke aathon batch gaye
 This incident has exposed the prison system, so questions are being raised about how someone ran away in such large numbers without any resistance, that too by killing a young man
 jail mantri ne shrinivasana jain ke saath baatcheet main mana ki unki zimmedaari banati he, lekin wo dedh maheenaa pehle jail mantri bani hai
 This is also true
 mantri ko hataa dene se sawaalon ke jawaab nahin mil jate hai, kyonki jail kaa nirmaan to dedh maheene pehle nahin hua he
 CCTV footage now becomes more important to detect the killing of Ramashankar than the escapees, because if the questions are being suspected in the name of Ramashankar's martyrdom, then at least his murder case must be opened
 jail kii police or rajya kii police do alag-alag sansthaaen hai
 The Home Minister of Madhya Pradesh had told in 'prime time' on Monday that the incident occurred between 12 and 3 pm and the state police received information around 4:30 pm
 dedh ghante kii deree hui
 How did the escapees get so many weapons, if the weapons came, they could get a vehicle to run, and could also pay attention to the highway adjacent to the jail
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma ne encounter kii jagah kaa muyna karte hue dikhaaya ki chotii se thodi dur ek jhopadi he vahaan par pehle ye chhipe hue bataaye ja rahe the
 Night will run away after killing a security personnel, so why hide here in this hut
 wo bhi inamen se teen bhaagane vaale pehle bhi khandwa jail se bhaag chuke hai
 He was absconding for a long time and was also accused of being involved in various criminal and terrorist activities
 ramashankar yadav kii hatya, jail prashasan kii chook in do sawaalon ke baad aata he, encounter kaa sawaal
 a variety of statements and video footage have also raised questions
 ek bayaan aayaa ki ye jail se bhagkar vaardaat karne vaale the
 When it was known that he was about to commit the crime, did it not come to know that he was also going to escape from jail
 yah baat bhi sahi he ki agar inkaa encounter nahin hota, yaa ye pakade nahin jate to aaj madhya pradesh police or suraksha agenciyon kii haalat karaab hoti
 But if you want to have an encounter in this way, then you cannot avoid questions
 shrinivasana jain ne ai ji yogesh choudhary se bhi baat kii
 Even twenty-four hours after the encounter, IG Yogesh Chaudhary is saying that three soldiers who were injured with sharp weapons
 faraar kaidiyon kii taraf se police kii ore goliyaan chalaai gayi
 Then how were the soldiers injured with sharp weapons
 kya ye encounter ekadam paas paas ho rahaa tha
 Wounded with a sharp weapon, only when both sides are close to each other
 gaanv ke sarpanch mohan singh meena ne bhi samachar agency e en ai se baat kii
 Meena's reply shows that he was stepping stones
 police kahati he ki unke paas desi bandooken thim, magar encounter main jo teen sipaahi ghayal hue hai wo dhardaar hathiyaar se ghayal hue hai
 Does the stone also count in the Sharp Weapon
 kai log maare gaye aath logon ko aatankwaadi kah rahe hai
 We have been taught in journalism that an accused or an alleged accused must be written until proven
 magar sab aatankwaadi kah rahe hai jabaki kisi ko sazaa nahin hui he
 There have been many cases in the past in which people have been kept in jail for ten or twenty years in the case of terror, they were called as terrorists but no evidence was found against them and they were acquitted by the Supreme Court
 aatank ke aarope main tamaam adaalaton se bari hue 24 aise logon kii kahani sankalit kar jamiya teachers solidarity association ne ek kitaab prakashit kii thi
 The name of the book is Framed Dammed Aquitted
 is kitaab main bari hue har cese ke peeche media kii cliping bhi he, jisamen aap dekh sakate hai ki giraftaar ke vakt media kaise aatankwaadi kehane lagata he
 Not only the media, relatives, friends or friends make all the distance
 aap hamaare screen par is vakt do tasviren dekh rahe hai
 One photo is of the young man, when he was 20 years old i
e
 1994
 ek tasviir 31 may 2016, ab umr he 43 saal
 Between these two pictures, 8150 days of this man's life have passed in jail
 23 saal jail main guzaarane ke baad ek din jab supreme court ne kaha ki jin bayanon ke aadhaar par nisaar ko aaajeevan karawas kii sazaa kaatani padi he wo saboot ke taur par paryaapt nahin hai
 Coming out of jail, Nisar felt that he was now left as a living corpse
 23 saal tak bagair kisi gunaah ke jail main rahane ke baad jab ghar aayaa to abba is duniya se ja chuke the
 She cried when she was wrapped with her mother, may have cried a lot
 kai rajyon kii police ne nisaar ko kai bam dhamaakon main aaropee banaakar 23 saal tak jail main rakhaa magar supreme court ne yahi kaha ki ikbaalia bayaan paryaapt rup se saboot nahin he
 Now you decide audience
 yah poocha ja rahaa he ki bhopal ke bhaage simi kaaryakartaaon ko kuch log yaa kuch patrkaar aatankwaadi kyon nahin kah rahe hai
 This question should be answered and the askers are asking exactly the right questions
 main chota sa prayaas karata hum
 On social media, people asking questions with vulgar abuses are asking whether they are being called terrorists because they are Muslims
 awwal to zyaadaatar channel or akhbaar aatankwaadi hi likh rahe hai, isliye ye shikaayat vaazib nahin he
 The complaint should be why terrorists are writing
 
 
 par kair
 Take the case of Nisar
 mujhe aap par yakeen he
 Knowing the story of Nisar, you will not say that this should not happen to a Muslim
 yahi kahenge ki kisi bhi bhartiya ke saath aisa nahin hona chahie, to bhopal maamle main jinhen aaropee kaha ja rahaa he, unhen aatanki kehane kii zid kyon hai
 Yes, they are definitely locked up on terror charges and also accused of killing a soldier
 ek kendriya mantri ne bhi ishaare main dharm ke kaaran inase sahanubhuti kii baat kahi he
 Encounter has persecuted everyone
 hindu ko bhi, sikh ko bhi, adivasee ko bhi or na jane kis-kis ko
 Recently there was a news in the Indian Express
 (iees afasar kinjal) This is the story of Manish Sahu from Lucknow
 ye ai e es adhikari kinjal hai, jo story likhe jane ke vakt baharich kii dm thi
 Kinjal's father KP Singh was a DSP in UP Police
 jab wo paanch saal kii thi tab uske pita ko police ke hi logon ne encounter kar diya
 KP Singh along with 12 people of the village were killed to prove the encounter
 31 saal tak beti ne ye mukadmaa ladaa
 Meanwhile, she became an IAS officer
 magar baap aparaadhiyon kii sangat main encounter main maaraa gaya, kaise bardaasht kar sakati thi
 After 31 years, the story came out that KP Singh himself went to apprehend the two criminals, but Sub Inspector RB Saroj, who was standing behind, shot him in his chest
 inspector saroj ko aaajeevan kaid kii sazaa hui
 12 police officers were punished
 inamen hindu bhi the or musalmaan bhi
 Therefore, questions have been raised on the police encounter
 iskaa hindu yaa musalmaan se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The comments iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki bhopal jail se bhaagane vaale apradhi nirdosh hai
 They are also not innocent until the charge is proved, but why the encounter cannot be questioned
 jail se kaise bhaage, kyon nahin sawaal ho saktaa, ramashankar yadav kii hatya kaise hui kyon nahin sawaal ho saktaa
 We have also seen how the media has written about Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, accused in the Malegaon bomb blast
 aaropee likhata he yaa aatankwaadi likhata he
 We could not research all the newspapers, but the full name is written directly in the heading of Indian Express
 heading main aaropee bhi nahin likhaa he, aatankwaadi bhi nahin likhaa he
 It is better that you decide with the government and the court together that from now on, whomever the police will catch will be called thieves, robbers, murderers or terrorists
 aaropee yaa kathith rup se aaropee nahin likhaa jayega
 These rules should be made for everyone
 jabatak ye niyam na ban jaae, mujhe aaropee likhane main koi dikkat nahin he
 Perhaps Nasir or IAS officer Kinjal will also not face any problem
 jail kii teen deevaaron ko samajhnaa zaruri he
 The first wall was seventy to eighty feet away from the cell where the terrorists are kept
 ye diwaar kareeb 35 feet oonchi thi
 After this, the second wall is 20 feet
 sabase baahar kii diwaar jise ham boundry waal kehete hai, wo chaar yaa paanch feet kii hoti he
 The outer boundary wall is two km
 jail ke andar 42 sisitivi camere lage hai
 These terror accused were kept in the b and c section, whose four CCTV cameras were not working
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma kaa kahana he ki inase kuch bhi nahin mila he
 It is not clear now that a barrack that contains many cells, there are only four CCTV cameras or more
 jailer ne bataaya ki jail main 5-6 camere 360 degree par ghoomane vaale hai
 Did all eight of them survive? is ghatana ne jail ke system ko expos kiya he isliye bhaage jane ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai ki koi bina kisi pratirodh ke itani badi sankhya main kaise bhaag gaya, wo bhi ek jawan kii hatya karke
 The prison minister, in a conversation with Srinivasan Jain, admitted that she had a responsibility, but she became the jail minister a month and a half ago
 ye baat bhi thik he
 The removal of the minister does not answer the questions, because the jail has not been built a month and a half ago
 sisitivi kaa footage ab bhaagane waalon se zyada ramashankar kii hatya kaa pataa lagane ke liye zyaada zaruri ho jaataa he, kyonki agar ramashankar kii shahadat ke naam par sawaalon ko sandigdh kiya ja rahaa he to kam se kam unki hatya kaa maamla zarur khulanaa chahie
 Jail police and state police are two separate entities
 madhya pradesh ke grahamantri ne somvaar ko 'prime time' main bataaya tha ki 12 se 3 baje ke bich ghatana hui or saadhe chaar baje ke kareeb rajya police ko soochna mili
 There was a delay of one and a half hours
 bhaagane waalon ke paas itane hathiyaar kaise aa gaye, agar hathiyaar aae to bhaagane ke liye gaadi bhi mil sakati thi, or jail se sate haive kii taraf bhi dhyaan ja saktaa tha
 Our colleague Nita Sharma, inspecting the location of the encounter, showed that there is a hut, a little away from the peak, where earlier they were being told to be hidden
 raat andhere kisi surakshasmarmi kii hatya kar bhaagega to yahaan is jhopadi main kyon chhipega
 He has also escaped from Khandwa jail, the first of the three to escape
 wo kaaphi lambey samay tak faraar rahe the or kathith rup se kai tarah kii aapraadhik or aatanki gatividhiyon main in par shaamil rahane kaa aarope bhi laga
 The murder of Ramashankar Yadav, the lapse of the jail administration comes after these two questions, the question of the encounter
 kai tarah ke aae bayanon or video footage ne bhi sawaal kii gunzaaish paidaa kii he
 a statement came that he was about to run away from jail
 jab ye pataa tha ki vaardaat karne vaale the to kya ye pataa nahin laga ki ye jail se bhi bhaagane vaale the
 It is also true that if they did not have an encounter, or were not caught, then the condition of the Madhya Pradesh police and security agencies would have deteriorated today
 lekin is tarah se encounter kaa hona aap chahen bhi to sawaalon se nahin batch sakate hai
 Srinivasan Jain also spoke to IG Yogesh Chaudhary
 encounter ke choubees ghante baad bhi ai ji yogesh choudhary kah rahe hai ki jo teen jawan dhardaar hathiyaar se ghayal hue hai
 On the part of absconding prisoners, bullets were fired towards the police
 phir dhardaar hathiyaar yani sharp vepan se jawan kaise ghayal ho gaye
 Was this encounter just getting close
 tej hathiyaar se ghayal to tabhi hoga jab donon paksh ek duusare ke kareeb hon
 Sarpanch of the village Mohan Singh Meena also spoke to the news agency ANI
 meena ke jawaab se maaloom padataa he ki ve pathar chalaa rahe the
 Police say that they had indigenous guns, but the three soldiers who were injured in the encounter were injured with sharp weapons
 kya pathar bhi sharp vepan main gina jaataa he
 Many people are calling the eight people killed as terrorists
 hamen patrakarita main sikhaaya gaya he ki sabit hone se pehle tak aaropee yaa kathith rup se aaropee likhnaa chahie
 But everyone is saying terrorists, while no one is punished
 ateet main kai aise maamle hue hai, jinamein aatank ke maamle main log das bees saal tak jail main band rahe, unhen aatankwaadi hi kaha jaataa rahaa magar unke khilaaf koi saboot nahin mila or ve supreme court se bari ho gaye
 a book was published by the Jamia Teachers' Solidarity Association after compiling the story of 24 such people acquitted from all the courts on charges of terror
 kitaab kaa naam he Framed Dammed Aquitted
 There is also a media clipping behind every case acquitted in this book, in which you can see how the media used to say terrorist during arrest
 media hi nahin, rishtedaar, dost-yaar sab duuri bana lete hai
 You are seeing two pictures right now on our screen
 ek tasviir us noujvaan kii he, jab wo 20 saal tha yani 1994 kii
 a photo 31 May 2016, now age is 43 years
 in do tasveeron ke bich is shaks kii zindagi ke 8150 din jail main guzare hai
 One day after spending 23 years in jail, the Supreme Court said that the statements based on which Nisar had to undergo life imprisonment are not sufficient as evidence
 jail se baahar aakar nisaar ko laga ki ab wo sirf ek zindaa laash kii tarah bachaa hua he
 Abba had left this world when he came home after being in jail for 23 years without committing any crime
 apni ammi se lipta to ro padaa, shaayad bahut hi royaa hoga
 Police in several states kept Nisar in jail for 23 years by making him accused in several bomb blasts, but the Supreme Court said that the confessional statement is not sufficient evidence
 ab aap darshak tay karen
 It is being asked why some people or some journalists are not calling the runaway SIMI workers of Bhopal as terrorists
 is sawaal kaa jawaab diya janaa chahie or poochne vaale bilkul sahi sawaal puch rahe hai
 i make a small effort
 soshal media par bhaddi gaaliyon ke saath sawaal poochne vaale kah rahe hai ki kya inhen aatankwaadi isliye nahin kaha ja rahaa he kyonki ye musalmaan hai
 Most of the channels and newspapers are writing terrorists, so this complaint is not valid
 shikaayat ye honi chahie ki kyon aatankwaadi likh rahe hai
 
 
 But well nisaar kaa hi cese lijie
 i believe on you
 aap nisaar kii kahani jaanakar ye nahin kahenge ki musalmaan ke saath aisa nahin hona chahie
 They will say that this should not happen to any Indian, so why are those who are being accused in the Bhopal case insist on calling them terrorists
 haa, wo aatank ke aarope main band zarur hai or ek sipaahi kii hatya karne kaa bhi aarope laga he
 a Union Minister has also spoken in sympathy to them due to religion
 encounter ne sabko sataaya he
 Even Hindus, Sikhs, Adivasis too and who knows whom
 haal hi main indian express main ek khabar chhapi thi
 (IAS Officer Kinjal) lakhanu se manish sahu kii ye story he
 He is an IAS officer Kinjal, who was the DM of Bahraich at the time of writing the story
 kinjal ke pita ke pi singh upi police main di es pi the
 When she was five years old, her father was confronted by the police
 encounter sabit karne ke liye ke pi singh ke saath saath gaanv ke 12 logon ko maar diya
 Betty fought this case for 31 years
 is bich wo ai e es afasar ban gai
 But how could the father, who was killed in an encounter in the company of criminals, tolerate it
 31 saal baad kahani ye nikali ki ke pi singh khud do aparaadhiyon ko pakadaney gaye the, lekin peeche khadey sab inspector aar bi saroj ne unki chaati main goli utaar di
 Inspector Saroj was sentenced to life imprisonment
 12 police adhikariyon ko sazaa hui
 Among them were Hindus as well as Muslims
 isliye police ke encounter par sawaal uthte rahe hai
 It has nothing to do with Hindus or Muslims
 tippaniyan This does not mean that the criminals who have escaped from Bhopal jail are innocent
 jab tak aarope sabit nahin hota tab tak ve nirdosh bhi nahin hai, lekin encounter par sawaal kyon nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 How can he run out of jail, why cannot there be a question, how can Ramashankar Yadav be killed, why cannot it be questioned
 hamane yah bhi dekha ki maalegaanv bam dhamaake kii aaropee sadhvi pragna singh thakur ke bare main media ne kaise likhaa he
 The accused writes or the terrorist writes
 ham saare akhabaaron ko to khangaal nahin sake lekin indian express kii heading main sidhe puraa naam likhaa he
 The accused is not written in the heading, the terrorist is also not written
 behatar he ki aap sarkaar or adaalat milakar tay kar len ki ab se police jise bhi pakad legi, wo chor, daaku, hatyara yaa aatankwaadi kehalaayegaa
 Accused or alleged accused shall not be written
 sabake liye ye niyam ban janaa chahie
 Until this rule is made, i have no problem in writing the accused
 shaayad nasir yaa ai e es afasar kinjal ko bhi dikkat nahin hogi
 This incident has exposed the prison system, so questions are being raised about how someone ran away in such large numbers without any resistance, that too by killing a young man
 jail mantri ne shrinivasana jain ke saath baatcheet main mana ki unki zimmedaari banati he, lekin wo dedh maheenaa pehle jail mantri bani hai

 ek bayaan aayaa ki ye jail se bhagkar vaardaat karne vaale the
 When it was known that he was about to commit the crime, did it not come to know that he was also going to escape from jail
 yah baat bhi sahi he ki agar inkaa encounter nahin hota, yaa ye pakade nahin jate to aaj madhya pradesh police or suraksha agenciyon kii haalat karaab hoti
 But if you want to have an encounter in this way, then you cannot avoid questions
 shrinivasana jain ne ai ji yogesh choudhary se bhi baat kii
 Even twenty-four hours after the encounter, IG Yogesh Chaudhary is saying that three soldiers who were injured with sharp weapons
 faraar kaidiyon kii taraf se police kii ore goliyaan chalaai gayi
 Then how were the soldiers injured with sharp weapons
 kya ye encounter ekadam paas paas ho rahaa tha
 Wounded with a sharp weapon, only when both sides are close to each other
 gaanv ke sarpanch mohan singh meena ne bhi samachar agency e en ai se baat kii
 Meena's reply shows that he was stepping stones

 Jail police and state police are two separate entities

 a statement came that he was about to run away from jail

 It is also true that if they did not have an encounter, or were not caught, then the condition of the Madhya Pradesh police and security agencies would have deteriorated today

 This is the story of Manish Sahu from Lucknow
 ye ai e es adhikari kinjal hai, jo story likhe jane ke vakt baharich kii dm thi
 Kinjal's father KP Singh was a DSP in UP Police
 jab wo paanch saal kii thi tab uske pita ko police ke hi logon ne encounter kar diya
 KP Singh along with 12 people of the village were killed to prove the encounter
 31 saal tak beti ne ye mukadmaa ladaa
 Meanwhile, she became an IAS officer
 magar baap aparaadhiyon kii sangat main encounter main maaraa gaya, kaise bardaasht kar sakati thi
 After 31 years, the story came out that KP Singh himself went to apprehend the two criminals, but Sub Inspector RB Saroj, who was standing behind, shot him in his chest
 inspector saroj ko aaajeevan kaid kii sazaa hui
 12 police officers were punished
 inamen hindu bhi the or musalmaan bhi
 Therefore, questions have been raised on the police encounter
 iskaa hindu yaa musalmaan se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The comments iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki bhopal jail se bhaagane vaale apradhi nirdosh hai
 They are also not innocent until the charge is proved, but why the encounter cannot be questioned
 jail se kaise bhaage, kyon nahin sawaal ho saktaa, ramashankar yadav kii hatya kaise hui kyon nahin sawaal ho saktaa
 We have also seen how the media has written about Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, accused in the Malegaon bomb blast
 aaropee likhata he yaa aatankwaadi likhata he
 We could not research all the newspapers, but the full name is written directly in the heading of Indian Express
 heading main aaropee bhi nahin likhaa he, aatankwaadi bhi nahin likhaa he
 It is better that you decide with the government and the court together that from now on, whomever the police will catch will be called thieves, robbers, murderers or terrorists
 aaropee yaa kathith rup se aaropee nahin likhaa jayega
 These rules should be made for everyone
 jabatak ye niyam na ban jaae, mujhe aaropee likhane main koi dikkat nahin he
 Perhaps Nasir or IAS officer Kinjal will also not face any problem

 Ever since Delhi came to power, the pull of the officers of the Aam Aadmi Party government and their ministers is well known
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal aksar ye aarope lagaate aae hai ki adhikari sarkaar ke aadesh ke ulat kaam karte hai yaa mantriyon kaa kahana nahin maanate
 The latest case is very surprising when the CM and the Health Minister openly question an officer on social media Twitter
 kejariwal sarkaar par virdohi ye aarope lagaate hai ki wo jhagada zyada or kaam kam karte hai
 Apparently, one of the major reasons for the estrangement may be the lack of coordination with the officers
 philhal ham jhagade kii charchaa isliye kar rahe hai kyonki ab tak band kamaron main hone vaali nonk-jhonk public main pahunch gai he or ise janata ke bich laane vaale koi or nahin, balki dilli ke swasthya mantri satyendra jain hai
 In fact, on Twitter, a person shared information about death of a patient in Delhi's Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan Hospital due to lack of ventilator facility
 iske baadasiem kejarivalane swasthya mantri satyendra jain ko twitor par hi fatkaar lagaate hue likhaa ki yah bardaasht nahin kiya jayega ki koi marij ventilator kii suvidha naa milane se mar jaae

 The Health Minister tweeted that the Health Secretary refused to accompany me to the hospital saying that he did not have a car
 iske baad jain ne twitor par hi bharti ke khilaaf apana gussa nikaala
 There is a death in LNH due to negligence
 i requested Sec health to reach Hospital with me
 He refused to come saying unavailability of car

 LG has appointed the most incompetent, useless n insensitive IAS officer as health secy — Satyendar Jain (@satyendarjain) December 11, 2016 The surprising thing is that on the one hand the CM and the Health Minister continue to accuse Twitter and meanwhile Health Secretary Chandrakar Bharti Lok Nayak reached the hospital
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki kya kisi adhikari par public main sawaal uthaanaa sahi kadam he? kya phone par in masalon ko nahin suljhaayaa ja saktaa tha?'aaj tak' ne jabaaam aadmi partise sawaal kiya to party pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne puure maamle main afasaron ko hi galat tehra diya or aarope lagaate hue kaha ki afasar unheen kii baat maanate hai, jo unke khilaaf karrwai yaa unhen transfar kar saktaa he
 As of today, these rights are with llsahab
 isliye mantri unka kuch nahin bigaad saktaa he
 Everyone knows this thing from peon to officer

 On the initiative of Nepal Engineers Association, an investigation has been started in Kathmandu for every house which has been damaged by the earthquake
 yahaan rihaayshi imaaraton ke saath-saath sarkari or aise imaaraton kii bhi padtaal kii jaaegi
 This is being done so that safe and dangerous houses can be identified
 phir usee hisaab se logon ko usamen rahane yaa na rahane kii salaah di ja sake
 Dhruv Thapa, president of Nepal Engineers Association, told NDTV India that nearly 90 percent of homes and buildings in Kathmandu have been affected by the earthquake
 inamen se 70 fisadi ghar rahane ke hisaab se surakshit hai, lekin 20 fisadi ko marammat ke baad hi rahane laayak banaaya ja sakegaa
 Whereas at least 10 per cent of the houses are such that they are not able to live at all
 bukamp kaa koi doosraa jhatka use puri tarah se tabah kar saktaa he
 Therefore, people are not advised to stay in such houses and buildings
 yahaan bahut se aise log jinke gharon ko thodaa bahut bhi nuksaan hua he, vah dar ke maare apane gharon main nahin ja rahe, balki tenton main rah rahe hai
 The Government of Nepal wants those whose houses are worth living to return to their homes
 isliye bhi ejiniyaron kii ye pahal bahut ahm he
 a control room has been built in the Engineer Building
 help line number ke zariye log yahaan apane ghar kaa pataa likhva rahe hai, taaki ejeeniyar unke ghar kii jaanch kar saken
 Engineers from all over the world, including countries like Germany, USA, Canada are reaching out to help in this work
 teen se paanch ejeeniyar kaa dasta alag alag ilaakon main jaataa he or gharon kii jaanch karata he
 Civil engineer Subhash Chandra Baral explains that houses are first examined from outside and then from inside
 isamen frem strecchar se lekar lod bearing strectochar yani pillar or beam se lekar deevaaron tak kii jaanch hoti he
 Cracks lying in the walls or cracks of the beam, its width and depth are measured
 tippaniyan Usually, if there is only a small crack in the wall, then the house is put in the green category
 lekin daraar agar do mem se adhik kaa ho to use surakshit nahin mana jaataa
 It is also seen that no part of the house is sunken from any side
 kul mila kar is jaanch ke zariye logon main bharosa paidaa kiya jaataa he ki unka ghar agar rahane laayak he to baahar tent main rahane kii zarurat nahin
 But thousands of such homes have to be investigated, in such a process it will take a long time to complete
 nepal ejiniers esoshiation ke adhyaksh dhruv thapa ne enditivi india ko bataaya he kathmandu ke qareeb 90 fisadi ghar or imaaraton par bukamp se kuch na kuch asar hua he
 70 percent of these houses are safe to live in, but 20 percent can be made liveable only after repairs
 jabaki kam se kam 10 fisadi ghar aise hai, jo bilkul rahane ke qaabil nahin
 Any other earthquake can completely devastate it
 isliye aise ghar or imaaraton main logon ko nahin rahane kii salaah di ja rahi he
 Many people here whose houses have suffered a little damage, they are not going to their homes because of fear, but are living in tents
 nepal sarkaar chaahati he ki jinke ghar rahane laayak hai ve apane gharon main laut jaaen
 Therefore, this initiative of engineers is very important
 ejeeniyar bhawan main ek control room banaaya gaya he
 People are writing their home address here through the help line number so that engineers can check their house
 is kaam main madad ke liye germany, america, canada jaise deshon samet duniya bhar ke ejeeniyar pahunch rahe hai
 Three to five engineer squads go to different areas and examine the houses
 civil ejeeniyar subhash chandra baral bataate hai ki gharon kii pehle baahar se jaanch hoti he phir andar se
 In this, from the frame structure to the load bearing structure, from the pillar and beam to the walls, it is tested
 deevaaron main padi daraar ho yaa beam kii daraar, uski chaudaai or gaharaai maapi jaati he
 The comments aamtaur par agar sirf diwaar main halki daraar ho to ghar ko green category yani rahane yogya category main rakhaa jaataa he
 But if the crack is more than two mm, it is not considered safe
 yah bhi dekha jaataa he ki makaan kaa koi hissi kisi taraf se dhansa to nahin he
 Overall, through this investigation, trust is created in the people that if their house is worth living then there is no need to live in a tent
 lekin is tarah ke hazaron gharon kii jaanch honi aise main is prakriya ko puraa hone main lanbaa vakt lagegaa

 However, the order does not mention pro-pakistan separatist Syed Ali Shah Geelani

 Even Congressmen are not untouched by this

 After this, when the CM was on the stage, a Congress councilor from Varanasi tied the bridge to praise him
 10 main 10 number!yogi adityanathke saath charchaa ke dauraan alag-alag shaharon ke logon kii raay lee gai
 In this connection, a Congress councilor from Varanasi clearly said that he will give the number 10 out of 10 according to the functioning of the Chief Minister till now
 agar isse zyada dene kaa vikalp hota to or number dete
 This councilor advised to look into the complaints being done under the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS)
 parshad ke mutabik is yojana ke tahat shahar main kaam to ho rahe hai, lekin shikayaton kaa nipataara nahin ho rahaa
 The councilor warned that the BJP may have to bear its loss in the upcoming local elections

 Varanasi is also the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
