 UP Police has succeeded in arresting the killer of two sisters who were burnt alive inside the house two days ago in Bulandshahr
 police ne aadhaar card ke aadhaar par hatyare ko khoj nikaala
 According to the police, one of the dead sisters, 23-year-old Sheelu's lover, refused to marry and first killed Shelu and then burnt her alive by killing her maternal sister Shivani
 police ne aaj donon bahanon kii hatya ke aarope main shilu ke premi ankit sirohi urf pushkal ko giraftaar kar liya
 During interrogation, Ankit confessed to the affair with Shilu and the murder of the two sisters
 darasal shilu ne ankit se shaadi se inkaar kar diya or prem main khud ko naakaam paakar ankit ne donon kii hatya kar di
 According to the police, Ankit committed the murder after the murder of Sheelu for fear of opening of eyewitness Shivani Kirage
 usne donon ko jalaakar hatya ke saare subut bhi mitaane chaahe, lekin ek galati vah jarur kar gaya
 Actually, he forgot his Aadhar card on the occasion
 ankit ne poochtacha main bataaya ki vab shilu ko kaafii samay se jaanata tha or donon ke parivaar main unki shaadi ko lekar baatcheet bhi chal rahi thi
 On Thursday morning, Sheelu called Ankit to meet him at his house

 darasal shilu ne ankit se shaadi se inkaar kar diya tha, jisase naaraaz hokar ankit ne shilu kii galaa dabaakar hatya kar di
 Ankit could not believe that Sheelu had died
 vah ghar se baahar niklaa or motorcycle se klach vir laakar dobaaraa shilu kaa galaa dabaa diya
 But Ankit again remembers that in addition to both of them there is a third member Shivani, who can reveal the secret of murder
 iske baad usne klach vir se hi shivani kii bhi galaa ghontkar hatya kar di
 To eradicate the evidence, he put kerosene in his house and set them both on fire
 der raat jab parivaar ke shesh sadsy ghar pahunche to ghar ke andar sannata pasra tha or ajeeb se gandh aa rahi thi
 In one room, there was a burning lashpari of Sushilu and in another room Shivani's body was also found in the state of water
 parijanon ke anusaar, unhen ghar main ankit ko mobile mila tha, jiske aadhaar par ankit ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai gai thi

 He said whether people like Yasin Bhatkal will now tell us how the government should be run
 karnataka main lau and order kii sthiti thik nahin he
 Significantly, Karnataka is to vote on May 12
 rajya main 15 may ko nattejey ghoshit honge
 Many recent opinion polls showed the possibility of a hung assembly
 opanian pole main devgauda kii party jedies king mekar kii bhoomika main nazar aa rahi he
 In the India Today poll, the Congress is likely to get 90 to 101 seats and BJP 78 to 86 seats
 vahiin jedies ko 34-43 seat milane kii sambhaavna he
 Google can be the best watchman in our public life
 jaise hi ghoshnaa hui ki kiran bedi bhaajapa main shaamil hone ja rahi hai, 28 agast, 2013 kii taarikh ko chapa unka ek bayaan miltaa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party had proposed giving ticket to Kiran Bedi and making her the chief ministerial candidate
 ise thukaraate hue kiran bedi ne kaha tha ki main aisi peshkash kaa sammaan karti hum
 i also fully understand the possibilities that i am getting offered, but i reject, because i am a non-political personality
 kiran bedi ne yah baat i-mail ke jariye firstpost se kahi thi
 Today is January 15, 2015
 kiran bedi raajnneetik vyakti ho chuki hai
 How this change came will be answered more by her statements than by the political prospects of the BJP, whose members she has become today
 22 november, 2014 ko kiran bedi kaa ek or bayaan google se nikalataa he, jisamen vah kahati hai ki atakalein chalati rahengi
 i am a public person, but i am not political
 saarvajanik or raajnneetik hone main fark he
 i deny all the news of joining BJP
 maine kab kaha ki kisi party kii sadsy ban jaaoongi
 i never said that i will join BJP
 congress or aam aadmi party ke samarthak google se aise bayaan nikaalkar twitor par kiran bedi ko gher rahe hai
 Arvind Kejriwal while praising Kiran Bedi said that i always kept saying that come in politics and today she has come into politics
 aam aadmi party ne bhi swaagat kiya he
 a person has a thousand arguments in favor of joining any party at any time
 desh kii seva se lekar vichaardhaara or vyakti se prabhavit hone ke tarkon kaa ek formet hamaare saarvajanik jivan main taiyaar rahata he, lekin bijepi ne apni taraf se uplabdh vikalpon main sabase behatar vikalp kaa istemaal kiya he
 The trump card is called walking
 yah uplabdhi bijepi kii bhi he ki usne kiran bedi ko taiyaar kar liya
 Like the Lok Sabha elections, 2014, there is no such situation, due to which the people of all parties from Congress to BJP have come to BJP in the name of salvage of the country
 kiran bedi tab bhi bijepi main nahin ai thim
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was praised on Twitter, but nothing more
 arvind kejariwal par bhi kabhi vyaktigat hamalaa nahin kiya
 In this case, she has never said like Shazia Ilmi that she is going to make revelations against the Aam Aadmi Party
 vaise in donon netaaon se bhi poocha janaa chahie ki soochna ke adhikaar, party fund or lokapal ke maamle main unki raay ab apni he yaa vahi he, jo bijepi kii hogi
 The Congress and the BJP refused to give their money through the Right to Information that they submit the report to the Election Commission after the election
 kya ab bhi loksabhaa chunaav jaisi koi sthiti he, jisase ubaarane ke liye kiran bedi bhaajapa main aa gai hai
 Kiran Bedi will explain this in various ways, but BJP has strongly challenged Arvind Kejriwal with the help of Kiran Bedi
 darasal bijepi yahi karti he
 When Kejriwal by his revelations forces the BJP to change the leader, then the BJP brings a leader with his image
 pichhali baar vijay goyal ko hataakar harshavardhan ko le ai
 With this, Kejriwal's government continued to be formed and BJP too came on par
 is baar jab guuruuvaar kaa din bijepi pradesh adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay par lage aaropon or uske javaabon main guzarataa, bijepi ne kiran bedi ko utarkar upaadhyaay par lage aaropon kii raajnneeti kii hawa nikaal di
 Today Kiran Bedi will be in the media
 yah or baat he ki doctor harshavardhan is ek saal main eemaandaar or polio ke nayak kii chhavi se kahin dur chale gaye hai
 He is also no longer the Minister of Health, for which he was praised
 kiran bedi ke aate hi bijepi kii ranneeti pichley ek saal main pehali baar badali he
 After a resounding victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP contested and won every assembly election in the name and face of Prime Minister Modi
 bijepi ke netaa kehete rahe ki rajyon main bhi modi kii sarkaar banegi
 Who will be the chief minister, not the public, will choose Modi or will choose the party
 kya dilli main kiran bedi ke aane se yah ranneeti badal rahi he
 Will BJP field Kiran Bedi as Chief Ministerial candidate in front of Arvind Kejriwal
 har survey main vyaktigat taur par kejariwal ko kaaphi badhat hasil thi
 Now two leaders will be face to face in every round of the survey
 isamen congress ke ajay maakan bhi honge, lekin unki sthiti ko lekar zyada atkal lagane kii zarurat nahin dikhti he
 There is no photo of any Delhi leader on all the posters of BJP in Delhi
 har slogan or vaade ke saath sirf pradhanmantri narendra modi hai
 
 
 So will the posters of Delhi also change this time
 narendra modi kii jagah yaa unke saath-saath kiran bedi postaron main hongi
 This is the fixed strategy of BJP
 loksabhaa se lekar har jagah vah apane virdohi dal ke netaa, ummidavaar or usase jude chehre ko shaamil kara leti he
 She increases her strength by combining the strength of the opponent in many places
 yani apane paas netaa nahin hai to unke netaa ko apana bana lo
 Under which circumstances do so many leaders defect, you cannot understand it only by nationalist interpretation
 raajnneeti bhi koi chiz hoti he
 Now, the team from the Anna movement will also compete with the Aam Aadmi Party from the BJP side
 puraane netaa sarathi kii tarah ladaai ladavaayenge
 Shazia Ilmi, Binny, Upadhyay will lead the front on behalf of BJP
 bijepi main aam aadmi party se kuch or netaa bhi aa gaye to kya achraj
 Today, news has come that a minister in the Mamata Banerjee government joined the BJP, but the opportunity to do all this remains with all the parties and everyone has done so
 bijepi ko dilli ke liye netaa mil gaya he
 There is no stain on Kiran Bedi either
 anna andolan ke samay arvind kejariwal kii tarah kiran bedi par bhi aarope lage the
 An NGO had alleged that she takes economy class tickets and runs in economy class
 is tarah ke aaropon se anna andolan ko kamazor karne kaa khub daur chalaa tha
 There are no more serious allegations on Kiran Bedi, yes, she also pulled the BJP in terms of the RTI Act
 dangon ko lekar pradhanmantri modi par sawaal zarur daage the
 The voters of Delhi are also tested
 ve kise chunate hai
 On one side is Arvind Kejriwal, who is among the people
 apni galati ke liye maafee maang rahe hai
 Doing meetings duusari taraf chunaav se 15-20 din pehle ain kiran bedi hai
 He is not in electoral politics, but has been in public life for a long time
 muqabla itnaa kantedaar hoga ki matadaata ke liye faisla karne main kam tanaav nahin hoga
 Now it has to be seen how the Aam Aadmi Party competes with the Kiran Factor
 bijepi se ladanaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Today it is a professional and powerful party
 dilli chunaavon ko lekar galaa-kaat pratiyogita chal rahi he
 Kumar Vishwas has tweeted today, 'never lose in wars, we are afraid of deceit, every time we are defeated, by the jyachandas of our home
 
 
 ' kavi vishwaas kaa yah tuk nahin, tir he
 Such arrows will move from both sides
 bas aap bachakar rahiega
 There is honesty at stake in the fight between two honest leaders
 siyasat main haar eemaandaaree kii hoti he
 Will also be further anna andolan kaa vaise bhi faluda nikal chukaa he
 Now the rest of its remains will be torn apart
 lokapal kaa mara-mara-sa kanoon kahin moorchhit padaa he
 No one will tear down where the Lokpal is, because the two Lokpal warriors will be fighting each other in the field to cut each other's throat
 is andolan ko apane paksh main modane main narendra modi tab bhi safal ho gaye the or aaj bhi
 The cunning in politics is killed
 jeetta vah he, jo chaalen chalata he, magar chaalaak nahin lagata
 Enjoy this powerful battle of Delhi elections
 haa, saans roke rahiega or nakhunon ko mat chaba jaaiega

 While answering a question on the show, Shahid Kapoor targeted his co-star Sonam Kapoor in the film 'mausam'
 darasal, sho ke dauraan 'se it or strip it' game chal rahaa tha
 According to the rules of the game, shahid-meera had to answer the question asked
 jawaab naa de paane kii sthiti main unako apane badan pe pahana hua ek kapadaa utaarna padataa
 Neha was asked by Shahid that which actress in the industry should be given time to read books instead of fashion and style
 jab shahid kapur ko chhodana padaa apana ghar, kai raaten bitaayan hotel menis par shahid ne kaha- maine industry main kai aisi hiroinon ke saath kaam kiya he jo film main apane kairactor ke mukaable apni costum par zyada dhyaan detii hai, lekin khushi kii baat ye he ki dhire-dhire is sthiti main badlaav ho rahaa he
 Sooraj Barjatya's film had saved this actor's sinking career, soon after Shahid's reply, Neha said - this season is to take off shoes
 lag rahaa he ki neha kaa ishaara sonam kapur ke taraf tha
 Let us tell you that Shahid and Sonam worked together in the movie 'mausam'
 film ko shahid ke papa pankaj kapur ne deract kiya tha
 At that time there were reports that a cold war broke out between Sonam and Shahid on the set

 Story, Acting and Direction
 prakaash jha ke satyagrah main do bandar kahani or diarection to nire jhuthe nikle
 Some of the acting took care because there were Amitabh Bachchan, Manoj Vajpayee and Ajay Devgan in some parts
 film satyagrah anna andolan, janalokapal bill, arvind kejariwal kii aap party, ejeeniyar satyendra dube ke murder or gandhi ke antim dinon ko milakar bani he
 In the midst of this, Prakash Jha has forced forced dramatics, love, item numbers and other important and heavy things according to them
 in sabake chalate film na to vaastavik rah paati he or na hi manoranjak
 It remains to be remembered that it is the same Prakash Jha who made real films like Gangajal, Kidnapping and Inspired films like politics
 2
 Prakash Jha started with Damul
 ham aap main se bahut kam ne hi is film ko dekha hoga, magar isaki tarif khub padhi gai
 Now let's return to the nineties, after lighting hands in some romantic triangles like Dil Kya Kare, Prakash returned to his land in Bihar and built Gangajal based on the Ghangarodwa scandal in Bhagalpur
 phir bihar ke hi sangathit apharan udyog par apharan film banaai
 This was Prakash Jha's new cinema, which also had real events and theatricality woven on the basis of the story
 phir ai raajnneeti
 Modern version of Mahabharata
 ye film unki ab tak kii sabase sabal film rahi
 It had the acting of Manoj Vajpayee, Ranbir Kapoor, Nana Patekar and Arjun Rampal, people saw many signs of today's politics
 phir shuru hua phislan bharaa trek
 It came into reservation, Chakravyuh and now Satyagraha
 desh ke maujuuda muddon ko itane satahi dhang se inamen rakhaa gaya ki kuch khurraat critic jo cinema par chalupane kaa aarope madhte hai, unhen naye naye udhaaharan mil gaye
 3
 film apane har mode par kisi beete hue magar yaad rah gaye aitihaasik vaakye kii yaad to dilaati he, magar uski pechidagi yaa maahaul ko jinda nahin kar paati
 Satyagraha is the story of an idealistic master, Dwarka Anand (bachchan), who lives and teaches in Ambikapur town
 unka betaa akhilesh anand badi degree ke baad bhi hai ve athurity main eemaandaaree se kaam kar apane kasbe ke liye kuch karnaa chahta he
 At the same time, his friend Manav Raghavendra (devgan) wants to make that big degree bigger in the corporate world
 phir akhilesh ke saath vahi hota he jo asal jindagi main 2003 main bihar main ejeeniyar satyendra dube ke saath hua tha, jab vah hai ve athurity ke thekedaaron ko thenga dikhaakar quality kaam par ade the
 4
 iske baad film do or kirdaaron ko sthapit karti he
 Hint giving 2G spectrum and human ready to move fast
 paale ke duusari taraf tej tarraar reporter tivi reporter yasmine khan (karina) jinaki entry ek power brokar ko sting main expoj karne se hoti he
 However, in showing this, the imagination of director Jha is also exposed
 5
 After Akhilesh's death, his friend Manav reaches Ambikapur
 halaat kuch aise ban jate hai ki system ko aainaa dikhaate master ji kasbe ke gandhi ho gaye hai, jail main hai or unhen chhudaane ke liye andolan shuru ho chukaa he
 Apart from the local youth leader Arjun (arjun Rampal), this movement stands on the basis of Facebook and Twitter
 ab ye samaj nahin aata ki ek pichde kasbe ambikapur main iske sahare andolan kaa shuruaati daur kaise safal hota he
 However, drawing raw inspiration from the Anna movement, the story moves forward and real faces begin to clear by the interval
 6
 Now there is a stage, a fast, there is violence, there are some representations of the government embroiled in the illusion of dialogue and they are being led by the local area coalition, which has made the government on the strength of some of its mlas, Minister Balram Singh (manoj Vajpayee)
 baatcheet, daman or ranneetik apadhapi chalati he or aakhir main film gandhi ji ke bengal ke noakhli dangon ko shant karaate kichint vivish dinon or unke ant ko yaad dilaakar apane mukaam anna andolan mukaam par pahunchati he
 7
 ye to rahi film kii kahani kii baat, magar is cocktail main bas element hi zyada hai, jo ek kasaavat honi chahie
 a thread around which everything is threaded
 vah gaayab sa he
 It seemed as if director and writer Anjum Rajabali had a kind of hurry to say everything in one film
 or phir is pher main shiraja bikhar gaya
 8
 film kii gambhirtha or naatakeeyata ko kuch ghatiya magar regular ho chuke formule bhi khatm karte hai
 An item song of indigenous style at the time of a hero's entry or a mess deal
 phir hero heroin ke bich ek lav song, jo katthi si imaaraton or slate si roshni ke bich filmaaya jayega, becoground main semi clasik andaaj main ek baari aawaaj piya, jiya jaisaa kuch vilambit lay main gaaegi or iske ant main prem nither kar duniyavi ho jayega bistar par
 And there would be long speeches every now and then before the climax, because not enough knowledge had been fed from the plot
 9
 The Satyagraha has great performances by Amitabh Bachchan and Manoj Vajpayee
 bachchan karunaa, sankalp or aagrah ko nae arth dete hai
 Just like Manoj, every time he gets a stitch in the skin of the character, he is simply made inside
 ajay devgan actor achche hai, magar yahaan unka role bahut tay pattern par chalaa
 Arjun Rampal was the biggest reason
 ab sochie jaraa yahi arjuna film raajnneeti main desh ke ek ahamkaari taqatvar yuva netaa kii yaad dilaate achche lage the
 But as a young leader of Ambikapur, he is very fake
 amrutha raav satyanarayan kii katha se nikali koi paatr lagati thim, pehle kii filmon main bhi or yahaan bhi
 Kareena Kapoor was posing in front of the camera as if she was presenting an entertainment show, not a political hoax
 phir kuchhek baar to laga ki jaise andolan kii koi ladki reporter banakar aa gai ho or sari vastunishthata dhari rah gai
 10
 film satyagrah kuchhek jagahon, modon ko chhodkar niraash hi karti he
 Marks in front of Gandhi idol and symbols like old India crumbling in front of children are unable to handle it
 kahani public ko pappu bananaa chaahati he
 Yasmin Khan is a reporter for the Hindi channel
 phir jansatyagrah andolan kii ek netaa ban manch par pahunchati hai or poster main jagah paati hai
 Then if there is a fight, then the car and crew of the same news channel are aboard
 film shuru hoti he or jaise hi kathanak bandhata he, sab kuch zyaadaatar vaise hi hota he, jaise aap soch sakate hai
 If a story cannot startle, it cannot innovate
 yaa phir jane pahachaane kisson ko nai najar se dekhne kaa tarika nahin bataa sakati to use kehane kaa auchity hi kya he
 There is a fake truth in satyagraha and cinematic insistence that come see me, i am not sure
 running for reservation for a long time 
 adaalat ne pradesh ke do jilon ke jat samudaay ko aarakshan suchi se baahar kar diya he
 Disregarding a 1999 order, the Jat community of Dhaulpur and Bharatpur districts have been excluded from the list
 haalanki, anya jilon main aarakshan ko manjuuri de di gai he
 The High Court also ordered the Rajasthan government to form a committee to inspect the status of castes that have registered obcs in the state in four months
 aarakshan ko chunauti dene vaali ek yachika kii sunwaayee karte hue chif justise sunil ambavani or justise ajit kumaar singh kii bench ne yah faisla sunaaya
 Dissatisfied with the decision of the court, the society has asked to appeal the case to the Supreme Court
 16 saal baad aayaa nirnayagauratlab he ki enasibisi kii report ke aadhaar par 3 november 1999 kojatonko rajya main aarakshan diya gaya tha
 But after the petition was filed in the reservation case, the High Court took 16 years to complete the hearing
 jaaton ko obisi main aarakshan dene ke khilaaf ratan bagdi or anya aath logon ne yachika daayar kii thi
 Five petitions were filed in 1999 and one petition in 2000
 baaki kir yachikaayen iske baad daayar huin
 The petition said that reservation is for upliftment not for prosperity
 jaaton kaa pichhadaapan adhyayan dwaara saamne aa saktaa he, lekin is par kabhi bhi sahi adhyayan nahin hua

 asp a post shared by SAPNA & KARAN (@isapnachaudhary_) on Nov 27, 2018 at 4:29am PST Delhi Police has arrested two accused in a case of assault on a journalist of 'aaj Tak' who came to cover the black exploits of the illegal supply of water from tankers in Fatehpur Beri area of delhi
 haalanki police ab bhi formahouson ke andar pani supplai kii avaidh gatividhiyon se inkaar kar rahi he
 Special Commissioner of Delhi Police Deepender Pathak said that action is being taken in this case and two accused have been arrested
 maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 However, when asked if illegal activities were going on in all the farmhouses in Fatehpur Beri area, he denied it
 special kamishnar se jab poocha gaya ki aam aadmi party kah rahi he ki unhone kai baar avaidh gatividhiyon ke bare main police ko bataaya, lekin police ne force nahin hone kaa hawala dekar kanni kaat lee, to is par unka kahana tha ki yah baat galat he
 Let us know that every year in Delhi, tanker mafia become active as soon as there is shortage of water in summer, the team of 'aaj Tak' reached Fatehpur Beri village in South Delhi on Sunday
 jahaan ye dekhne ko mila ki kaise form house kii aad main tanker mafia jameen se pani nikaalkar uskaa kaarobaar kar rahe hai
 Water is being supplied to many areas of Delhi by tanker mafias
 pani kii killat se jujh rahe logon ke liye pani ke tanker kii keemat 1800 rupee se lekar kai hajaar rupee tak he
 In addition, these water mafia also supply water to hotels in Delhi
 is ilaake main ground water lagaataar kam hota ja rahaa he
 When the team of 'aaj Tak' captured the mafia in their camera, it was found that this type of business is happening in the firm house of Chhatarpur
 gaanv main kheti ke naam par borwell lagaakar tanker mafia sarkaar or police prashasan kii naak ke neeche dilli main raaj kar rahe hai
 Aaj Tak's photographers were capturing the business of the tanker mafia in camera that the tanker mafia operatives first misbehaved and then attacked Aaj Tak's writer
 saath hi yah dhamkee bhi di ki ham is ilaake ke vidhayak se lekar sabakuch hai
 The tanker mafia said that we have a say from corporator to parliament
 koi hamaara kuch nahin kar saktaa
 However, the corporator of the area apologized over the phone due to the misbehavior with the team of 'aaj Tak'
 bataa den ki jis form house se pani bharaa ja rahaa tha wo ilaake ke nigam parshad kaa hi he
 84 There has been a spurt in the politics of UP regarding the Kosi revolt
 viechpi ne elaan kiya he ayodhya kii kosi parikrama nirdhaarit kaarykram se hi hogi
 The VHP has appealed to the UP government to reconsider its decision
 viechpi ne is mudde par desh bhar main andolan kii chetavanee bhi di
 VHP leaders said that the decision to stop the yatra was taken under pressure from Azam Khan, a minister in the UP government
 mangalvaar ko yah mudda loksabhaa main uthaa or bijepi ne is mudde par jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 VHP President Ashok Singhal warned the Uttar Pradesh government that if it used force to enforce the ban, it would face adverse consequences
 singhl ne daawa kiya ki 20 divasiy yatra ke liye sapa kaa samarthan maangane ke liye jab vah 17 agast ko yadav se mili to vah vichaar ke liye grahanshil the
 In a clear reference to Uttar Pradesh government minister Khan, Singhal said, "we are surprised to know the government's decision
" unki party main muslimon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale netaa ne baithak ke prati nakhushi jataai thi or yadav spasht taur par dabaav main jhuk gaye
 'khan had expressed unhappiness about the meeting and said that it would send a wrong message to the Muslim community
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ne suraksha kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue somvaar ko ‘84 kosi padayatra’’ pratibandhit kar di
 He was suspected of political reasons behind the VHP decision as elections are due next year
 singhl ne daawa kiya ki iske peeche koi raajnneeti nahin he kyonki ayodhya main ram mandir ke liye unka andolan chah dashak se adhik samay se chal rahaa he
 He said that the pilgrims from all over the country have been informed about the yatra and it cannot be canceled
 yah yatra purvi uttar pradesh ke chah jilon se hokar gujaregi jiske jariye mandir ke liye samarthan jutaney kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 Meanwhile, amid the Uttar Pradesh government's decision not to allow the vhp's proposed Ayodhya Chaurasi Kosi Yatra and the vhp's decision to uphold its intention, the state police said that the boundaries of all six districts under its purview would be sealed and closely monitored
 Will go
 mullaperiya baandh mudde par bhaawanaaon ko shant karne kaa prayaas karte hue pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne guuruuvaar ko tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri je jayalalita ko patr likhakar kaha ki aisa kuch nahin kaha yaa kiya janaa chahie jisase bina vajah dehshat much jaae
 He hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably through dialogue
 jayalalita kii chitthee kaa jawaab dete hue singh ne kaha he ki unhone kendriya jal sansaadhan mantralay se kaha he ki vah lambit muddon ke hal or vaastavik chintaaon ko shant karne ke liye tamilnadu or kerala ke sambandhit adhikariyon kii yathashighra baithak yojit karen
 He sought Jayalalithaa's cooperation on the issue
 unhone likhaa he, mainen aapke dwaara uthaaye gaye binduon kaa note taiyaar kar liya he or maine kerala sarkaar ke mantriyon ke pratinidhimandal dwaara uthaaye gaye muddon ko bhi gaur se suna he
 i told them that the matter is currently before the High Powered Committee of the Supreme Court

 Amid speculation of his resignation, he made it clear during a press conference in New Delhi on Friday that he was ready to hand over the responsibility to the new Congress candidate
 manmohan ne bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi par unki dukhati rag ke hawaale se waar bhi kiya
 When asked about the comparison between Modi and Rahul, he said, 'it will be disastrous for the country to make a mass murderer on the streets of Ahmedabad
 'kya modi kaa 'congress-mukt bharat' kaa sapana kabhi puraa hoga,puche jane par manmohan ne kaha ki main gambhirtha se yah maanata hum ki mistar modi kii yah baat kabhi puri nahin hone vaali
 When asked about the name of the PM candidate, Manmohan said that the Congress President has already said that the PM candidate's name will be announced when the time comes
 manmohan ne mana ki unki sarkaar naukariyaan paidaa karne or mahangaai rokane main naakaam raheen
 But even today, the Prime Minister was lethargic in his address and replies
 unki body language main na hi koi utsaah tha or na hi apni sarkaar ke dephence main koi thos tark
 Arun Jaitley had asked Manmohan five questions a day before, some of them were asked by journalists on his own behalf
 apane kaam ko manmohan ne maujuuda paristhitiyon ke hisaab se acha bataaya
 He said that he did as best he could, and only historians would assess his work
 sawaal: upie-1 se upie-2 tak karpshan ke kai maamle saamne aae
 Don't you think the image of your Mr
 Clean was tainted, and for all these reasons, the Aam Aadmi Party was born? koyala ghotaalaa or 2 ji ke aarope bhi
 Allegations of irregularities in coal block or 2G allocation were also made during UPA-1
 uske baad ham chunaavon main gaye or apane pradarshan ke dam par chunaav jeeta
 People gave us a mandate
 isliye ye jo mudde jinhen samay-samay par sieji, court yaa media ne uthaaya he
 It should be remembered that these are during UPA-1
 is desh ke logon ne karpshan ke un aaropon par dhyaan nahin diya
 The Commonwealth Games, 2G, coal all damaged the government's image
 kya koi or tarika tha
 i feel sad main hi tha, jisane jor diya tha ki spectrum aavanton ko paardarshee or nishpaksh hona chahie
 i was the one who talked about the coal block
 vipaksh ke apane swaarth hai
 The media plays in their hands many times
 isliye mere paas har kism kaa yakeen he ki jab is vakt kaa itihaas likhaa jayega to ham bina daag ke niklenge
 There have been some glitches
 magar inhen sieji or media dwaara bahut badha chadhaakar pesh kiya gaya he
 Question: You said that you will not play the third innings
 upie kii sarkaar banane par bhi
 So what will be your political role ahead? Prime Minister: i have indicated that i am not going to be the PM candidate for the third term
 rahul gandhi kaa jabardast role he or piem candidet ke liye unhen nominete kiya janaa chahie
 This will be done at the right time

 Question: The blame for the defeat in the assembly elections was put on inflation
 kya isse takalif hoti he ki sab iljaam centre sarkaar par laga diya gaya
 And what will be said on the pattern of hike in diesel prices? Prime Minister: This is not the right forum to talk about subsidies
 par main eemaandaaree se kahuunga ki mahangaai ek vajah rahi congress ke kharaab pradarshan kii
 i have already told that the reasons for inflation were beyond our control
 antarrashtriya kaarak the, eendhan kii keemton main ijapha tha
 And i think we have taken adequate steps to save the poor section of the society from inflation
 anaaj or duusari jaruri chizon kaa vitaran dhaancha durust kiya gaya he
 Through MNREGA and other employment schemes, we have provided security to the farmer and laborers
 inhen darkinar nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Question: Prime Minister, you promised in the manifesto that the Sachar Committee would implement the report
 aapaki minurity ko lekar shuru program jameen tak kyon nahin pahunch pate hai?pradhanmantri:hamane kaaphi kaam kiya he cameti report lagu karne main
 i am sad that all this work could not reach the people
 ye bhi thik he ki kuch aisi baaten hai jo abhi kerani baaki hai
 Some are lying in courts
 kuch or mushkilen ai hai
 Because of which more things could not be implemented
 jahaan tak hamaari sarkaar kaa taalluk he
 Scholarships have been increased for minorities
 skill badhaane ke liye alpsankhyak bahut rajyon main kaarykram chalaae ja rahe hai
 Enough work has been done
 magar or bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Question: In the last 10 years, you have been accused of being the most silent
 aap sahi samay par raajnneetik jawaab nahin dete rahe hai
 Do you think you were silent on some occasions when you should have spoken? Prime Minister: As far as speaking is concerned
 jab bhi jarurat padi he
 i have been speaking in the party forum and will continue to speak
 muskura die yah kahkar chaar maheene baad chunaav hai
 Can there be some further improvements
 kya ye aapaki praathamikta hai
 These are not an event process
 jab tak ham sarkaar main hai sudhaar jari rahenge, jahaan bhi inaki gunjaaish or jarurat he
 Question: What will Arun Jaitley say on Virbhadra Singh's allegations? Prime Minister: i have not yet got time to focus on this
 maine kuch akhabaaron main in aaropon ke bare main padhaa he
 Right now i am not in a position to comment on it
 sawaal:kya beete kuch saalon main aapane apane bheetar kuch badlaav mahasoos kiye hai?pradhanmantri:main vahi aadmi hum, jo 9 saal pehle tha
 There is no change in me
 maine puure nishtha-samarpan ke saath kaam kiya he
 During this time, he never acted to benefit his friends or relatives
 sawaal: maujuuda daur main bharat-america sambandhon par aapaki raay?pradhanmantri: ham bharat-america sambandhon ko sabase zyada mahatv dete hai
 Recently there have been some difficulties
 magar meraa puri gambhirtha ke saath maananaa he ki ye choti-moti chijen hai or diplomasi ke jariye inhen suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Question: Regarding fencing on the borders of the North Eastern states? And regarding the killing of rhinos in the northeastern states? Prime Minister: That's right
 barbandi ke maamalon main kuch dikkatein ai hai
 There are geographical problems
 gandon kii hatya ke maamle main har tarah kaa kaam kiya janaa chahie
 Question: Now votes are being held in the name of the leader
 kya aapako lagata he ki hamaare desh main bhi raashtrapati system hona chahie taaki gathbandhan ke dabaav na jhelane paden?pradhanmantri:maine is bare main sochaa nahin he gaharaai se
 My initial reaction is that the parliamentary system is better in terms of India's complex and polymorphic structure
 president system behatar nahin hoga
 Question: You could not take action on your tainted cabinet ministers? Prime Minister: History will be more kind to me than the contemporary media and opposition
 halaat or gathbandhan kii majaburiyon ke maddenjar maine best kiya he
 He is going to complete his tenure as Prime Minister and is ready to hand over the baton to Rahul Gandhi
 kya modi or rahul kaa muqabla barabari kaa hoga?pradhanmantri:mujhe puraa yakeen he ki aglaa pradhanmantri upie gathbandhan kaa hoga
 It would be disastrous to make the person who massacred the streets of Ahmedabad the Prime Minister of the country
 sawaal: vitt mantri ke rup main desh aapaki aarthik udaarikaran kii nitiyon ko aaj bhi yaad karata he
 How will the country remember your legacy as PM? What have you missed in 10 years? Prime Minister: He did the best he could
 itihaaskaar tay karenge ki main kitna safal rahaa
 What happened in my 9-year tenure was much better than the 6-year tenure of NDA
 sawaal: kya aapako lagata he ki party main satta ke do centre kii vyavastha kargar rahi?pradhanmantri:party adhyaksh or pradhanmantri, ye vyavastha bahut shandaar dhang se chali he
 i completed my 10 years without any difficulty
 mujhe party adhyaksh kii taraf se koi dikkat nahin ai
 Mrs
 Gandhi's support was important in solving many complex issues
 sawaal: aap apane lambey kaarykaal ke dauraan ek baar bhi pakistan nahin ja paae?pradhanmantri:main nishchit taur par janaa chaahunga
 i was born in a village in Pakistan which is a part of West Punjab
 magar pradhanmantri ke taur par main pakistan tabhi ja saktaa hum jab halaat durust hon behatar nateezon ke liye
 Thought about it many times, but finally felt that right now is not the right chance
 mujhe ab bhi ummid he ki piem kaa pad chhodane se pehle main vahaan ja paaungaa
 Question: What will you say on the rise of Aam Aadmi Party? What will you say on the audit of power companies? Prime Minister: The people of India have expressed confidence in the AAP party in Delhi
 hamen loktantric tareekon kii izzat karnaa chahie
 Only time will tell whether it will be able to withstand the challenges of economy and politics
 abhi to bas ek haftaa hi hua he
 Question: Again and again you invite Rahul Gandhi to join the government
 vah manaa kar dete hai
 You don't mind? Prime Minister: i always felt that if Rahul Gandhi were part of the government then the government would have been stronger
 magar rahul ko lagata he ki sanghathan ko unki zyada jarurat he or main isse sahamat hum
 This is not my view
 agar aapako lagata he ki logon kii yah soch he
 So what can i do itihaaskaar tay karenge ki meri kamajoriyaan or majbootee kya hai
 Things were difficult because of the global slowdown
 magar hamane bahut acha kiya he

 There was confusion throughout the day on Thursday over the resignation of two Telugu Desam ministers from the central government
 phir jaakar ye baat saamne ai ki telugu desham ke donon mantri yani ashok ganpati raju or wies choudhary shaam ko pradhanmantri se milane ke baad istipha saunp denge
 While demand for special status for Andhra Pradesh is getting increasingly heated in the state, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu also announced in the Assembly on Thursday that his two ministers had resigned from the Modi government
 vahiin dilli main kuch or hi dekhne ko mila
 Both ministers of Telugu Desam wanted them to speak before the House before resigning
 raju jahaan loksabhaa ke sadsy hai vahiin choudhary rajyasabha ke
 Telugu Desam was trying its best to convey his message in the House to the people of Andhra Pradesh about the extent to which he can go to the special status of Andhra and remove both ministers from the Center
 darasal, loksabhaa chunaav ke saath andhra pradesh main agle saal vidhansabha chunaav bhi hone hai or vahaan vipaksh andhra pradesh se centre kii taraf se ho rahe vyavhaar ko bada mudda bana rahaa he
 In such a situation, there was no way other than Chandrababu Naidu to take a tough stand against the Center
 philhas tidipi ke mantri nahin de rahe istifaye baat duusari he ki guuruuvaar ko sansad nahin chalane kii vajah se telugu desham ke donon mantriyon ko bolne kaa mauka hi nahin mila
 It has been made clear by the Telugu Desam Party that at the moment only the ministers are resigning but the NDA will continue to support
 telugu desham party kii chintaa yah he ki andhra pradesh main jagan reddy kii wiesar congress or congress donon is baat ko tool de rahe hai ki centre sarkaar main shaamil hone ke baavjood chandrababu naidu andhra pradesh ke liye vishesh rajya kaa darja hasil nahin kar sake
 Jagan Reddy is constantly moving among the people to create an atmosphere against the Telugu Desam Party
 aise main telugu desham party ke liye yah jaruri he ki andhra pradesh ke logon ke bich yah sandesh jaae ki andhra pradesh kii behatari ke liye vah satta chhodane ko taiyaar hai
 Now Naidu was getting only assurance Chandrababu Naidu was earlier known for the fact that under pressure he used to bring money from the central government to the state
 isse pehle bhi jab atal bihari vaajapei ke samay chandrababu naidu dilli aate the to kaha jaataa tha ki kabhi khaali haath nahin lautate
 But this time Chandrababu Naidu is getting more than just money
 bijepi bhi jaanati he ki telugu desham naaraazgi bhale dikhaa le lekin uske paas andhra pradesh main zyada vikalp nahin he
 That is why the BJP is trying to convince the Telugu Desam Party, but is not too worried about its threat
 tidipi ke saath anya sahyogi bhi naarazbijepi ke is ravaiye se sirf telugu desham nahin balki duusare sahyogi dal jaise shivasena bhi naaraaz hai
 The Akali Dal cloud is also showing signs of complacency
 sahyogi dalon ko lagata he ki unhen ab vaisaa mahatv nahin miltaa jaisaa atal bihari vaajapeyi ke samay sahyogi dalon ko miltaa tha
 In fact, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, at that time the NDA desperately needed the support of allies to remain in power
 kyonki vaajapeyi ke samay bijepi ke paas apane dam par bahumat nahin tha
 But on the basis of the pair of Modi and Amit Shah, BJP is continuously winning elections in one state, while they also have majority in Lok Sabha
 naaraazgi ke baad bhi endie ke saath he shivasenashivsena is baat ko dekh chuki he ki bijepi se jab zyada jhagada badha to bijepi ne shivasena ko do took kaha ki agar unhen alag janaa he to ja sakate hai
 The Shiv Sena knows that the BJP is also forming relations with the NCP on the one hand, which is why there is speculation that Sharad Pawar could have joined the BJP
 in halaat main tamaam naaraazgi jataane ke baad bhi shivasena endie ke saath bani hui he or abhi tak bijepi se sambandh nahin todaa he
 BJP will feel like Junk like Akali Dal is not very happy with BJP these days
 akali dal ne bajet kii bhi yah kahkar aalochana kii thi ki isamen kisaanon kaa dhyaan nahin rakhaa gaya he
 But the Akali Dal is also compelled that after losing the elections in Punjab, the party's position is not very good and apart from being with the BJP, they have no other option
 lekin sahyogi dalon kii is naaraazgi se vipaksh ke netaaon main ummid bani hui he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle inamen se kuch partiyaan endie se chhitakengi or bijepi ko jhatka lagegaa
 On being released from jail on Thursday, senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha challenged the Hemant Soren government of Jharkhand, saying that his aim was not to stand up and gain the post of Chief Minister, but through this movement, the corrupt government of the father-son Has to be overthrown by state power
 jail se rihaai ke baad sabase pehle yashavanth sinha apane samarthakon ke saath base resham gaanv pahunche jahaan se unhone apana andolan do june ko prarambh kiya tha or giraftaar kiye jane par jamaanat na lekar jail janaa sweekaar kiya tha
 Sinha launched the electricity supply for the village with two newly installed electric transformers in this village, which got electricity for the first time after independence there
 gaanv main ekatrit hajaaron logon kii bheed ko sambodhit karte hue yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki jail jane kaa unka faisla kahin se bhi rajya kaa mukhyamantri banane kii laalasaa ke saath nahin tha
 He wants to rid the public of all difficulties and his main objective is to overthrow the corrupt government of son Hemant Soren and father Shibu Soren from the state
 yashavanth sinha ne kaha, ‘main ranchi pahunch kar jharkhand bhaajapa ke netaaon ke saath baithak karuunga or rajya ko vikaas kaa nayaa rasta dikhaane ke liye ranneeti tay karuunga jisase yahaan se jharkhand mukti morcha kii sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkaa ja sake
 For this purpose, a statewide movement will be launched from June 21
 kendra main jis prakaar maa-bete kii sarkaar ko satta se bhaajapa ne ukhaad phenkaa
 Similarly, the government of father and son will also be overthrown in Jharkhand
 ’unhone kaha ki logon ke sahyog se is pichde gaanv main vah sirf 15 dinon main bijli kii aapurti chaalu kara sake jiske liye vah das vashren se prayasarat the lekin koi sakaaratmak pragati nahin ho paa rahi thi
 Earlier, former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha, who was jailed, was released from the jail after 17 days along with 61 of his supporters
 yashavanth sinha ne party ke varishthatam netaa laalkrishna adwani ke anurodh ko dekhte hue kal yahaan nyaayik magistrate kii adaalat main jamaanat yachika pesh kii thi jise sweekaar karte hue unhen or unke samarthakon ko saat-saat hajaar rupee kii do jamaanat par reeha karne ke adaalat ne aadesh diye the

 Today everyone is suffering from stress
 tanaav ek aisi samasya ban gai he ki jisase sirf bade nahin balki bachche bhi grasit hone lage hai
 It seems to us that children do not have any kind of stress, all the worries are only for the elders
 lekin ye dharna galat hai
 Each age has a different responsibility and concern
 ek nai study ke mutabik, agar aapkaa baccha skool naa jane ke bahaane banaata he or sirf ghar par baithna chahta he, to ye sambhav he ki aapkaa baccha tanaav se pareshaan ho
 According to a study done by the University of External Medical School, if your child's school attendance is very low, the reason for this may be stress
 CAMA main prakashit is study se ham is baat kaa adhyan kar sakate hai ki kis prakaar se tanaav, bacchon kii skool main upasthiti se judaa hua he
 Let me tell you, while attending this study, the attendance of the school was divided into 4 parts
 aasaan shabdon main unhone wo kaaran chinhit kiye jiske chalate bachche skool se chuttee lete hai
 Those were the four reasons - sometimes not going to school, leave due to illness, leave without any reason, clear refusal to go to school
 ab shodhakartaaon ko adhyayan karke pataa chalaa ki bina kisi kaaran ke jo chuttee lee jaati he, usamen sabase bada kaaran tanaav hota he
 According to Katy Finning, the lead researcher of this study, it is very worrying that children at such a young age are suffering from stress
 unhone is baat par bhi jor diya ki ye tanaav bacchon kii padhai ke saath unki saamaajik or aarthik vikaas main bhi baadha ban saktaa he
 She further says, 'we have come to know this problem in the initial stage, now we should find some solution as soon as possible to make the lives of these innocent children
 'bataa den, bacchon main in lakshan ko samajhnaa kai baar mushkil ho saktaa he
 So according to study researcher Tamsin Ford many times children can complain that they have pain in their stomach or head
 aisi paristhiti main skool ke staff ko in lakshanon ko nazarandaaj nahin karnaa chahie kyonki ye sambhav he ki in lakshanon kaa kaaran tanaav ho
 We also need to understand that minor stress is not a disease
 thodaa tanaav to kisi ko bhi ho saktaa he
 But if this stress is negatively affecting your child's life and his ability to work, then it is worrying
 vaise bataa den, tanaav kaa ilaaj sambhav he or is par thik samay par kaabo bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 But denying stress is not the solution, it can aggravate the problems
 vaise kuch sansthaae is baat par bhi jor de raheen hai ki abhi is mudde par or adhyan kii aavashyaktaa he
 It is also important to see that it is not that the children are under stress due to low attendance in school
 uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar ne is baar kaanvadiyon kii yatra ko surakshit banane ke liye kai upaay kiye hai

 prashasan ne 11 binduon main ek guidelinemerut, mujffarnagar, bulandshahr,gajiabad, noida, aligarh, bareli, bijanour, muradabad or hapur tathaa anya jilon main bhej di he
 CM Yogi Adityanath had already said that special arrangements would be made for drones, helicopters to monitor Kandar travel through four national highways and two major rail routes
 puure sawan main yah yatra pashchimi uttar pradesh ke kai jilon se guzarati he
 The maximum number of people go to Panipat in Haryana via Roorkee, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Shamli and Kairana 
 doosraa root rudki se saharanpur hote hue he
 On these two routes, Kanwarias travel in religious numbers in lakhs

 Regardless of the blatant revelations against Narendra Modi, DG Vanzara, who has been with the IPS, the BJP will not stop giving Narendra Modi the 'highest price'
 bijepi ke ahm sutron ke mutabik, party agle chunaav ke maddenjar narendra modi or unke kareebi sahyogi amit shah ko pehle hi tarah tavajjo detii rahegi
 According to the party, the Congress is playing tricks to shock Narendra Modi's claim for the post of PM
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki aane vaale dinon main congress narendra modi ke khilaaf is tarah ke or hamale kar sakati he
 BJP leaders say that the moment Modi is being targeted, he raises huge doubts
 'hedlins today' se baat karte hue bijepi sutron ne ye baaten kahin
 After Vanzara's revelations, the RSS is constantly in touch with top BJP leaders
 sangh parivaar modi kii chhavi ko pahunche nuksaan kaa akalan kar rahaa he or isaki bharpai ke upaay talash rahaa he

 Vanzara says, "with the passage of time, i realized that this government is not interested in protecting us, but it is trying to keep us inside secretly so that we can protect ourselves from the CBI"
 banjaaraa ne likhaa he, 'amit shah ko bachaane ke liye ram jethmalani laayaa gaya, lekin hamaare liye modi sarkaar ne kuch nahin kiya

 Due to public pressure, CPM again had to choose VS in the next election

 The sharpest sarcasm of VS has occurred to those who have raised the issue of their age
 unhone 2014 main rahul gandhi ko “amul baby” kahkar hawa main uda diya tha jab gandhi ne apni had paar kii thi
 His growing age has no effect on those who want VS

 The matter of high profile sex racket in Madhya Pradesh seems to be being made of Director General of Police vs

 rajya main vishesh diji (estf or sibar cell) purushottam sharma ne khulkar maang kii he ki esaiti kii nigaraanee ek diji-rank kaa adhikari jo police mukhyalay ke baahar kaa ho use karnaa chaiye
 Madhya Pradesh DGP VK Singh recently vacated the flat rented by special DG Purushottam Sharma in Ghaziabad for the work of his department
 sutron ke mutabik kuch aise input mili the ki is flats se kuch taar kathith sex racket se jude the
 High profile sex racket case: Senior IPS of cyber cell under investigation! After returning back from Kerala in this case, Purushottam Sharma said, "it is my personal opinion that the constitution of SIT has been in constant controversy
" pehle iskaa netritv IG-CID kar rahe the, phir ADG- rank ke adhikari ko iskaa pramukh banaaya gaya or baad main iske sadasyon ko bhi badal diya gaya
 Subsequently, the guest house of the cyber cell was linked to Honey Trap
 puure vivaad ke baad meraa mat he ki police mahanideshak kii chhavi vivaadon main aa jaati he
 According to my opinion, now the supervision of SIT to any other DG rank officer who is outside the police headquarters will be relevant for justice
 duusari baat, main vyaktigat rup se yah bhi maanata hum ki sibar cell or estf ke saare kaam bahut samvedansheel hote hai, jiskaa prabhaav bahut bada hota he aise main isse jude log vishesh kaaryon ke dauraan kahaan rahete hai use saarvajanik nahin kiya janaa chahie, kyonki iske prabhaav gambhir ho sakate hai
 It is possible that their lives are also threatened

 telugana mudde par hangaame ke kaaran teen din se baadhit loksabhaa kaa sheetakaaleen satr nirdhaarit samay se teen din pehle aaj anischitkaal ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 Before adjourning the house indefinitely before the scheduled time, Speaker Meera Kumar said that for the last few days it is very disturbing that the tendency of a class to disrupt the proceedings of the House for its political issues has increased
 unhone is pravriti ko behad ‘chintajanak’ bataate hue sadasyon se aagrah kiya ki ve is pravriti kaa ‘eemaandaaree se atmavlokan’ karen or yah sunishchit karen ki apane muddon ke liye sadan ko baadhit karne kii pravriti par niyantran lagaakar swasth charchaa ke jariye baaten rakhane kii parampara phir se sthapit ho sake
 Meira Kumar said that the proceedings of the House on the Telangana issue were disrupted in the last two days, but any issue can be resolved amicably by adopting a democratic process
 unhone kaha ki desh kii ek arab se adhik kii aabaadi apane pratinidhiyon se apeksha rakhti he ki ve unki samasyaon par charchaa karen or unka samaadhaan nikaalen
 Following this statement, the house was adjourned sine die at around 12:30 pm with the tune of Vande Mataram
 isse pehle telugana mudde par hangaame ke kaaran hi lagbhag 35 minute ke liye kaarywahi ko 12 baje tak sthagit kiya gaya tha
 It is worth noting that this session of Lok Sabha started on 19 November was to run till 21 December as per the pre-determined schedule

 Sources close to the report in HT said that the show's host Manish Paul was wearing his earphones during the shoot so that the show's makers could give him directions
 mekars ke kuch ne kehane par manish ne kuch ajeeb tarah kaa muhan banaaya to is dauraan ravina unke bilkul saamne thim
 Raveena felt that Manish was giving strange expressions after seeing them

 After this Manish also sat in his vanity van in anger

 Earlier, there were reports that Shantanu Maheshwari had an argument with Raveena Tandon, the judge of the show
 reports ke mutabik shantnu or unki baliye ko sho ke jajes ravina tandon or ahamed khan se jo scorese mil rahe the wo usase khush nahin the
 Shantanu feels that judges discriminate against other contestants and they are given far less marks than they deserve
 pinkavila kii report ke mutabik ravina tandon ko jab ye baat pataa chalati he to wo shantnu se kahati hai agar aapako aisa lagata he to duusare logon ko ye cheez bolne ke bajaae aapako mujhase ye baat kerani chahie thi
 According to the report, there is a lot of debate between Raveena and Shantanu while talking on this issue
 iske alaava wild card contestants ke taur par sho main vaapasi karne ke baad sho kii jaj ravina tandon, urvashi par bhadak gai hai
 Actually, Urvashi Dholakia was not happy with her elimination
 aliminete hone par unhone sho or jajes ke khilaaf gussa jaahir kiya tha
 For this reason, Raveena became angry with Urvashi
 ravina, urvashi se kahati hai- mauka yahaan par aap logon ko diya gaya he

 com / kivcrmp9zy— ANI (@ani_news)june 30, 2015 Rashtriya Janata Dal is upset in Bihar
 unki pareshaani kaa kaaran bijepi nahin, balki unke do sahyogi janata dal united or congress hai
 The Congress has been his old ally, so the Rashtriya Janata Dal leaders look more than the Congress party's sign in which they made it clear that if the alliance of Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar is not there, then the Congress would like to contest elections under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, Although the Congress party has not taken any decision, but from Delhi to Patna, Congress leaders have a general opinion that Lal Good Bihar headed by Yadav face of Nitish Kumar
 lekin sawaal yah he ki aakhir congress apane sabase puraane sahyogi ko chunavi majhadaar main kyon alag-thalag karnaa chaahati he
 According to the Congress leaders, so far Lalu Yadav's attitude seems to be that he wants to contest the election more than BJP alliance considering Nitish Kumar as his opponent
 bihar ke congressi netaaon kii spasht raay he ki lalu yadav jinhen yah vaastivaktaa maaloom he ki agar janata dal united congress, rajd gathbandhan ek saath chunaav ladega tab jeet kaa safar aasaan ho saktaa he, uske baavjood lalu yadav seat se lekar netritv tak ke mudde par jaise khud yaa apane kareebi raghuvansh prasad singh ke madhyam se bakheda khadaa kar rahe hai
 Anyway, his claim to fight BJP has raised many questions
 duusari baat siton ke maamle main lalu yadav ne kabhi bhi congress party ke prati udaartaa nahin barti he
 This is true, due to which the Congress wants to go to the electoral arena with Nitish Kumar once, although the Congress leaders believe that even though the seats get less, Lalu, Nitish and Congress come together, there is no doubt that their number of mlas this time Will be in digits
 abhi tak congress ke ranneetikaar maan kar chal rahe hai ki nitish kumaar ke saath jane se na keval ek daagi vyakti ko samarthan karne kii aalochana se ve bachenge, saath hi nitish kumaar kii saaf-suthri chhavi he
 Congress party leaders also know that even if Lalu Yadav's insistence on not making Nitish the chief ministerial candidate is accepted, the BJP will benefit from it, because then the BJP will campaign that Lalu Yadav will again be Rabri Devi or The Congress party is trying every step to make its son the chief minister
 philhal congress party yah maan kar chal rahi he ki agar unke alaakaman ne nitish ke saath jane ke faisle par muhar laga di tab na keval muslim balki congress se ruthi agadi jatiyon ke ek varg kaa vot or saath hi gaiyr-yadav pichhadi jatiyon ke alaava ati pichhadi jatiyon kaa vot unhen mil saktaa he, jo narendra modi sarkaar dwaara manaregaa or duusari yojana main hui katautee se naaraaz chal rahaa he
 The comments philhal nitish kumaar ke paksh main sabase badi baat congress ke netaa yah tark dete hai ki vah chaahe pichley saal ke vidhansabha ke upachunaav hon yaa vidhaan parishad kii siton kaa talmail, janata dal united ke netritv ne unhen darkinar kar koi nirnay lene kii koshish nahin kii, vahiin lalu yadav ne siton ke talmail par pichley saal kaa loksabhaa chunaav ho yaa usase pehle ke chunaav waisi siten deen, jis par chunaav ladane kii congress party kii koi taiyaari nahin thi
 Politics also believe that the Congress party is currently doing politics of pressure, its effort is to soften its stand on the synergy of seats and Lalu Yadav should negotiate and as soon as possible the three parties go between their workers and the common people
 But how successful it all is, it depends on Lalu Yadav's stance that defeating BJP for him in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections is the first priority
 Ikta or Nitish Kumar to bring the margin bigger challenge

 vaise bhi bijepi se ladane ke unke daawey par kai sawalia nishaan khadey hue hai
 Secondly, Lalu Yadav has never shown leniency towards the Congress party in terms of seats
 yah aisa sach he, jiske kaaran congress ek baar nitish kumaar ke saath milakar chunaav ke maidan main janaa chaahati he haalanki congressi netaa maanate hai ki bhale siten kam milen, lekin lalu, nitish or congress saath aae to nisandeh unke vidhayakon kii sankhya is baar do ankon main hogi
 As of now, Congress strategists are assuming that going with Nitish Kumar will not only avoid criticism of supporting a tainted person, but Nitish Kumar has a clean image
 congress party ke netaa yah bhi jaanate hai ki lalu yadav ke nitish ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar na banaae jane kii jid ko agar maan bhi liya jaae to iskaa phayda bijepi ko hi hoga, kyonki tab bijepi yah prachaar karegi ki lalu yadav phir rabari devi yaa apane kisi putr ko mukhyamantri banane ke jugad main lage hai isliye congress party har kadam phoonk-phoonk kar rakh rahi he
 At present, the Congress party is assuming that if their high command endorsed the decision to go with Nitish, then not only Muslims but the vote of a section of the staunch forward castes from the Congress as well as non-yadav backward castes apart They may get votes of backward castes, who are angry with the cuts in MNREGA and other schemes by the Narendra Modi government
 tippaniyan At present, the biggest thing in favor of Nitish Kumar is that the Congress leaders argue that whether it is the by-election of last year's assembly or the assembly of the Legislative Council, the leadership of Janata Dal United did not try to take any decision bypassing them
 At the same time, Lalu Yadav gave the seats of last year's Lok Sabha elections or earlier elections on the synergy of seats, on which Congress Party to contest elections Minister had no preparation
 raajnneeti ke jaankaar yah bhi maanate hai ki congress party philhal dabaav kii raajnneeti kar rahi he, uskaa prayaas he ki lalu yadav siton ke talmail par apana rukh naram karte hue baatcheet karen or jald se jald teenon partiyaan apane kaaryakarta or aam logon ke bich jaaen, lekin yah sab kitna safal ho pataa he, yah lalu yadav ke rukh par nirbhar karata he ki aagaamee bihar vidhansabha chunaav main unke liye bijepi ko parajeet karnaa pehali praathamikta he yaa nitish kumaar ko haashiye par laana usase badi chunauti

 raajnneeti ke jaankaar yah bhi maanate hai ki congress party philhal dabaav kii raajnneeti kar rahi he, uskaa prayaas he ki lalu yadav siton ke talmail par apana rukh naram karte hue baatcheet karen or jald se jald teenon partiyaan apane kaaryakarta or aam logon ke bich jaaen, lekin yah sab kitna safal ho pataa he, yah lalu yadav ke rukh par nirbhar karata he ki aagaamee bihar vidhansabha chunaav main unke liye bijepi ko parajeet karnaa pehali praathamikta he yaa nitish kumaar ko haashiye par laana usase badi chunauti 
 
 
 Politics also believe that the Congress party is currently doing politics of pressure, its effort is to soften its stand on the synergy of seats and Lalu Yadav should negotiate and as soon as possible the three parties go between their workers and the common people
 But how successful it all is, it depends on Lalu Yadav's stance that defeating BJP for him in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections is the first priority

 The match between the two teams, which had been eliminated long before the playoff race, was just about who survived the last place

 Yuvraj Singh's Pune Warriors did better on the basis of net runrate and Delhi had to slip to the last place

 One over was bowled in which Delhi's three wickets were up for 56 runs
 kareeb paune nau baje barish shuru hui or khel rokna padaa
 It continued to rain since then and the umpires decided to cancel the game after inspection at around 10:30

 aaj kal har din koi na koi diwas yani de aa jaataa he
 One day does not go until another day arrives
 har de kii apni pratigya hoti he or na bhuulane kii kasame hoti hai, magar ye usee din tak ke liye valid hoti he
 The next day comes the second day, the poster banner changes everything
 nae sire se pratigya leni padati he ki ham inke aadarshon ko nahin bhuulenge
 Forget that you have taken one such vow on the previous day
 sarkari tantra par behad dabaav rahata he ki us par bhuulane kaa ilzaam na lag jaae
 You will see that somewhere around the country, someone's day is being celebrated
 in diwason kii taiyaari par kitna vakt lagata he, vigyaapan par kitna paisa karch hota he or mantriyon ke aane jane or logon ke le jane or pahunchane main kitna sansaadhan lagata he, iskaa ek adhyayan hona chahie
 It is not a matter of disrespect to anyone, but during this time, the market also keeps a lot of dey on its side and the government is also in a very difficult situation
 in diwason kii adhikta ke bare main sochaa janaa chahie
 On November 16, there was a lot of congratulations from whatsapp to Facebook inbox, and it was National Press Day
 usee whatsap main 15 november ke kuch video pade the, jo jharkhand kii sthapana diwas ke the
 You will also tell what happened to the people on that occasion, but in this video you see what happened to the people as well as journalists
 zyaada kuch nahin he, jharkhand kaa police tantra 16 november ke rashtriya press diwas ke liye patrakaron ko practice kara rahaa tha ki ab state kii nazar main press kaa matlab kya rah gaya he
 The crowd that belongs to the mercury teachers of Jharkhand
 jo jagah he vah morahabadi maidan main jharkhand sarkaar sthapana diwas manaa rahi thi
 a large number of mercury teachers reached there
 paara shikshakon kaa alag masalaa he
 We did prime time about that
 phir se bataaenge ki kya masalaa he, lekin jab ye paara shikshak apni maangon ko lekar pradarshan kar rahe the, kaale jhande dikhaa rahe the tab police ugr ho gai
 Police say the mercury teachers were furious, which led to the use of sticks for control
 phir press waalon par kaise chal gai
 Pintu, the photographer of Jagran with yellow T-shirt, is Rajesh Tiwari, the reporter of Prabhat Khabar, whose knee is injured, he is the cameraman of TV18, and the cameraman in which the police are lathi charged in this picture is the local news channel
 Cameraman
 patrakaron kaa daawa he ki saat patrakaron ko chotein ain hai
 An FIR has been lodged in this case
 ranchi press club ne is ghatana kii ghor ninda kii he
 You should decide what to say to these journalists who were hurt by sticks on National Press Day
 ab aate hai paara shikshakon kii samasya par
 They claim that they reached the number of ten thousand on the occasion of the foundation day of Jharkhand, so that the government would listen to them
 jharkhand main kareeb 69 hazaar paara shikshak hai jo pehali se lekar aathvin tak padhaate hai
 Some also teach in tenth
 paara shikshak sangh ke sangrakshak manoj kaa kahana he ki 8400 se lekar 10,164 rupaya miltaa he
 Middle school mercury teachers get 10,164 only
 paara shikshak sangrakshak kaa daawa he ki kareeb pachaas hazaar paara shikshak 8400 rupee masik vetan par hi padhaa rahe hai
 Obviously this is very less, and they say that without making any agitation, their salary does not increase even after eating sticks
 kai baar chah-chah maheene kii selary nahin milti he
 The government still has his salary of several months
 8000 kamaane vaale kii selary bhi nahin milegi to paara shikshak kaa jivan kaise chalegaa
 Therefore, these mercury teachers reached thousands of people in the state's foundation day celebrations and started shouting slogans
 kaale jhande dikhaae
 Their fierceness can be understood, because you can imagine how the teacher of primary school, who teaches for Rs 6000, would have won
 isliye ye kaale jhande dikhaa rahe honge lekin tabhi vahaan par lathi charge ho gai
 You see in these pictures how the police are running and killing them
 paara shikshakon kii maang he ki jis tarah se chhattisgarh main aath saal tak asthaayee kaam karne ke baad permanent ho jaataa he, usee tarah jharkhand main bhi niti bane
 The salary of mercury teachers in Chhattisgarh has gone from 23 to 26 thousand, yet it is fine, but in Jharkhand, we do not survive in the salary of 6 to 8 thousand
 8 november ko inaki mulaakaat mukhyamantri se hui thi magar kuch sahmati nahin ban saki
 Even in Bihar, the mercury teacher is found to be 22,000, so why the mercury teacher of Chhattisgarh gets 8400
 manoj kaa kahana he ki pachaas hazaar paara shikshak ranchi pahunch gaye the
 This type of problem is in many states
 sarkaar naukari dene ke naam par kai tarah kii chaalaaki karti he
 People take government jobs in the hope that it will become permanent but does not happen
 theke par rakhe jane vaale aise karmchaariyon kii sthiti behad kharaab hoti he
 They work in very little salary for many years
 15 saal se paara shikshakon kaa andolan chal rahaa he
 After teaching so many years, he has reached a salary of 10 000
 ranchi se harbans ne bataaya he ki kareeb 300 paara shikshakon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he or unhen redcross sosayadi main rakhaa gaya
 Many mercury teachers were caught on the way
 redcross ke campus main adaalat lagi or kareeb 300 logon ko jail bhej diya gaya he
 Manoj says that 1000 are kept in Khelgaon
 in shikshakon par dhara 144, 341, 360, 353, 337 or 320 ke tahat aarope lagaae gaye hai
 Many of these are serious charges, the punishment of which is more than a year
 badi sankhya main paara shikshak ghayal bhi hue hai
 Police teachers have hurt many teachers
 paara shikshak padhaate hi nahin hai, sarkaar ke baaki survey main bhi lagaaye jate hai
 It is National Press Day
 haryana ke rewadi chalate hai
 Journalists here were celebrating Press Day by tying a black stripe on the District Secretariat
 unka kahana he ki khabar likhane ke kaaran patrakaron ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 They say that Pradeep Narayan, a senior journalist from Rewari, had published the news of corruption in the RTA
 jiske baad prashasan ne patrkaar ko hi target par le liya or use artie kaa dalal banaakar cese kar diya
 In the press note issued from the ADC office, it was written that the journalist Pradeep Narayan had played a role of a broker and got a fake heavy driving license
 yah saaf nahin he ki kathith rup se is aarope main artie kaa koi karmchaaree tha yaa nahin, uske khilaaf cese hua he yaa nahin
 The comments patrkaar pradeep kaa kahana he ki prashasan saboot dikhaae
 Journalists say the administration is scaring the press with such case lawsuits
 rose hamen kisi na kisi rajya se chaatro kaa samooh email karte rahata he
 These are the students who are waiting for the result after taking the exam and if the result comes then they are waiting for joining
 aaj hi ek messej aayaa ki ham log 78 ummidavaar hai, jinhen ssc mts 2016 ke tahat civil aviation dijisie mila tha
 The final result was arrived only on 28 April 2018, but the joining has not been done yet
 april se november aa gaya he
 There is no answer when calling in the DGCA
 kabhi-kabhi yah kaha jaataa he ki aapaki vaikency samaapt ho chuki he
 We are very upset
 aisi hi ek chitthee madhya pradesh se ai he
 The students feel that it would have been good if the result had come under the pressure of the election itself
 chaatro ko bataaya jaataa he ki aachaar samhita ke kaaran riselt nahin aa rahaa he
 The students fear that after the election is over, the game will happen again and the result will be stuck for a long time
 kya pataa kabhi riselt hi na aae
 So they are writing again and again to show it once in prime time
 har baar or har kisi kaa dikhaanaa sambhav nahin he kyonki aap jaanate hai ki yah samasya itani vikaraal he ki ise cover karne ke liye mere paas sansaadhan bhi nahin he
 Millions of students across the country are troubled
 koi poochne vaala nahin
 Listen to this letter
 likhaa to chaatro ne he magar awaz hamaare sahyogi kii he
 You would have an idea of what circumstances the youth are going through
 baat kisi ke anadar kii nahin he, lekin is vakt main bazaar bhi apni taraf se kai de thele rahata he or sarkaar bhi to bahut vikat sthiti paidaa ho jaati he
 The excess of these days should be thought about
 16 november ko whatesaip se lekar fasebuk ke inbox main dher sari badhaaiyaan padi thim, dekha to rashtriya press diwas kii thi
 In the same whatsapp, there were some videos of November 15, which were about the foundation day of Jharkhand
 us maukey par logon ke saath jo hua wo bhi bataaenge magar aap is video main dekhie ki logon ke saath saath patrakaron ke saath kya-kya hua
 Not much, Jharkhand's police system was practicing journalists for the National Press Day of November 16 to see what the press meant in the eyes of the state
 jo bheed he wo jharkhand ke paara shikshakon kii he
 The place where the Jharkhand government was celebrating Foundation Day at the Morhabadi Maidan
 vahaan par badi sankhya main paara shikshak pahunch gaye
 Mercury is a separate issue of teachers
 uske bare main hamane prime time kiya tha
 Will again tell what is the issue, but the police became angry when these mercury teachers were demonstrating their demands, showing black flags
 police kahati he ki paara shikshak ugr ho gaye the jiske kaaran niyantran ke liye lathi chalaani padi
 Then how did the press go
 pile tii shart vaale jaagran ke photographer hai pintu, aap prabhaat khabar ke reporter rajesh tiwari hai, jinke ghutane main chot ai he wo tivi 18 ke cameraman hai or is tasviir main police jis cameraman par lathi taane hue hai wo sthaneey news channel taaja khabar ke cameraman hai
 Journalists claim that seven journalists have suffered injuries
 is maamle main exiaar darj karai gai he
 The Ranchi Press Club has strongly condemned the incident
 rashtriya press diwas par lathi se chot khaae in patrakaron se kya kaha jaae, aap hi tay karen
 Now come on the problem of mercury teachers
 inkaa daawa he ki ye das hajaar kii sankhya main jharkhand kii sthapana diwas ke maukey par pahunche the, taaki sarkaar unki baat ko sune
 There are about 69 thousand mercury teachers in Jharkhand who teach from first to eighth
 kuch log dasvin main bhi padhaate hai
 Manoj, the guardian of the Para Teachers Association, says that from 8400 to 10,164 rupees are received
 middle skool vaale paara shikshak ko 10,164 hi vetan miltaa he
 The guardian of the mercury teacher claims that about fifty thousand mercury teachers are teaching at a monthly salary of Rs 8400
 zaahir he ye bahut kam he, or inkaa kahana he ki bina andolan kiye, lathi khaae unki selary badhati bhi nahin he
 Sometimes, six months salary is not available
 abhi bhi sarkaar ke paas inaki kai maheene kii selary baaki he
 If the salary of 8000 earners is not available, how will the life of a mercury teacher go? isliye hazaron kii sankhya main ye paara shikshak rajya kii sthapana diwas ke samaaroh main pahunch gaye or naare lagane lage
 Shown black flags
 inaki ugrata samajhi ja sakati he, kyonki 6000 rupee main padhaane vaala primary skool kaa teacher kaise jeeta hoga, aap kalpana kar sakate hai
 So they must be showing black flags, but only then the sticks were charged there
 aap in tasveeron main dekh rahe hai ki kaise police dauda-dauda kar maar rahi he
 There is a demand of mercury teachers that the way Chhattisgarh becomes permanent after eight years of temporary work, the policy should be made in Jharkhand as well
 chhattisgarh ke paara shikshakon kii selary 23 se 26 hazaar tak ho gai he, wo phir bhi kuch thik he, lekin jharkhand main 6 se 8 hazaar kii selary main hamaara guzaaraa nahin hota he
 He met the Chief Minister on 8 November but could not reach a consensus
 bihar main bhi paara shikshak 22,000 miltaa he to chhattisgarh kaa paara shikshak 8400 kyon miltaa he
 Manoj says that fifty thousand mercury teachers reached Ranchi
 is tarah kii samasya kai rajyon main hai
 The government does many tricks in the name of giving jobs
 log sarkari naukari le lete hai, is ummid main ki sthaayee ho jaaegi magar hoti nahin he
 The condition of such contractual employees is very bad
 kai saal tak ye bahut kam selary main kaam karte hai
 The movement of mercury teachers has been going on for 15 years
 itane saal padhaane ke baad ye 10 000 kii selary par pahunche hai
 Harbans from Ranchi has told that about 300 para-teachers have been arrested and placed in the Red Cross Society
 bahut se paara shikshakon ko raste se pakad kar laayaa gaya
 a court was set up on the Red Cross campus and about 300 people have been sent to jail
 manoj kaa kahana he ki khelgaumv main 1000 pakadakar rakhe gaye hai
 These teachers have been charged under sections 144, 341, 360, 353, 337 and 320
 inamen se kai gambhir aarope hai jissi sazaa ek saal se adhik he
 a large number of mercury teachers have also been injured
 police kii lathi se kai shikshakon ko chot ai he
 Mercury teachers are not only teaching, they are also employed in the rest of the government survey
 rashtriya press diwas he
 Rewari runs in Haryana
 yahaan ke patrkaar zila sachivalay par kaali pattee baandh kar press diwas manaa rahe the
 He says that journalists are being targeted for writing news
 inkaa kahana he ki rewadi ke ek varisht patrkaar pradeep narayan ne artie main bhrashtachar kii khabar chhap di thi
 After which the administration took the journalist on target and made a case by making him an RTA broker
 edisi daftar se jo press note jari hua tha, usamen likhaa tha ki patrkaar pradeep narayan ne dalal kii bhoomika nibhaate hue farji haivi driving license banavaa lee thi
 It is not clear whether the case has been filed against the alleged RTA employee or not
 tippaniyan Journalist Pradeep says that the administration showed evidence
 patrakaron kaa kahana he ki prashasan is tarah ke cese mukademon se press ko daraa rahaa he
 Every day a group of students from some state keeps emailing us
 ye wo chaatr hai jo pariksha dekar riselt kaa intazaar kar rahe hote hai or riselt aa jaataa he to jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hote hai
 Today a message came that we are 78 candidates, who got the Civil Aviation DGCA under ssc mts 2016

 One such letter has come from Madhya Pradesh
 chaatro ko lagata he ki agar chunaav ke dabaav main hi rigelt aa jaataa to acha rahata
 Students are told that the result is not coming due to the code of conduct
 is baat ko lekar chaatro ko andeshaa he ki chunaav biit jane par phir khel ho jayega or riselt lambey samay ke liye atka diya jayega
 Don't know the results isliye ve baar baar likh rahe hai ki ek baar prime time main dikhaa dijie
 It is not possible to appear every now and then because you know that this problem is so rare that i do not even have the resources to cover it
 lakhon kii sankhya main desh bhar main chaatr pareshaan hai
 No one is going to ask
 aap is patr ko suniye
 Students have written but the voice of our colleague

 We are very upset
 aisi hi ek chitthee madhya pradesh se ai he
 The students feel that it would have been good if the result had come under the pressure of the election itself
 chaatro ko bataaya jaataa he ki aachaar samhita ke kaaran riselt nahin aa rahaa he
 The students fear that after the election is over, the game will happen again and the result will be stuck for a long time
 kya pataa kabhi riselt hi na aae
 So they are writing again and again to show it once in prime time
 har baar or har kisi kaa dikhaanaa sambhav nahin he kyonki aap jaanate hai ki yah samasya itani vikaraal he ki ise cover karne ke liye mere paas sansaadhan bhi nahin he
 Millions of students across the country are troubled
 koi poochne vaala nahin
 Listen to this letter
 likhaa to chaatro ne he magar awaz hamaare sahyogi kii he
 You would have an idea of what circumstances the youth are going through
 rashtriya press diwas par lathi se chot khaae in patrakaron se kya kaha jaae, aap hi tay karen
 Now come on the problem of mercury teachers
 inkaa daawa he ki ye das hajaar kii sankhya main jharkhand kii sthapana diwas ke maukey par pahunche the, taaki sarkaar unki baat ko sune
 There are about 69 thousand mercury teachers in Jharkhand who teach from first to eighth
 kuch log dasvin main bhi padhaate hai
 Manoj, the guardian of the Para Teachers Association, says that from 8400 to 10,164 rupees are received
 middle skool vaale paara shikshak ko 10,164 hi vetan miltaa he
 The guardian of the mercury teacher claims that about fifty thousand mercury teachers are teaching at a monthly salary of Rs 8400
 zaahir he ye bahut kam he, or inkaa kahana he ki bina andolan kiye, lathi khaae unki selary badhati bhi nahin he
 Sometimes, six months salary is not available
 abhi bhi sarkaar ke paas inaki kai maheene kii selary baaki he
 If the salary of 8000 earners is not available, how will the life of a mercury teacher go? isliye hazaron kii sankhya main ye paara shikshak rajya kii sthapana diwas ke samaaroh main pahunch gaye or naare lagane lage
 Shown black flags
 inaki ugrata samajhi ja sakati he, kyonki 6000 rupee main padhaane vaala primary skool kaa teacher kaise jeeta hoga, aap kalpana kar sakate hai
 So they must be showing black flags, but only then the sticks were charged there
 aap in tasveeron main dekh rahe hai ki kaise police dauda-dauda kar maar rahi he
 There is a demand of mercury teachers that the way Chhattisgarh becomes permanent after eight years of temporary work, the policy should be made in Jharkhand as well
 chhattisgarh ke paara shikshakon kii selary 23 se 26 hazaar tak ho gai he, wo phir bhi kuch thik he, lekin jharkhand main 6 se 8 hazaar kii selary main hamaara guzaaraa nahin hota he
 He met the Chief Minister on 8 November but could not reach a consensus
 bihar main bhi paara shikshak 22,000 miltaa he to chhattisgarh kaa paara shikshak 8400 kyon miltaa he
 Manoj says that fifty thousand mercury teachers reached Ranchi
 is tarah kii samasya kai rajyon main hai
 The government does many tricks in the name of giving jobs
 log sarkari naukari le lete hai, is ummid main ki sthaayee ho jaaegi magar hoti nahin he
 The condition of such contractual employees is very bad
 kai saal tak ye bahut kam selary main kaam karte hai
 The movement of mercury teachers has been going on for 15 years
 itane saal padhaane ke baad ye 10 000 kii selary par pahunche hai
 Harbans from Ranchi has told that about 300 para-teachers have been arrested and placed in the Red Cross Society
 bahut se paara shikshakon ko raste se pakad kar laayaa gaya
 a court was set up on the Red Cross campus and about 300 people have been sent to jail
 manoj kaa kahana he ki khelgaumv main 1000 pakadakar rakhe gaye hai
 These teachers have been charged under sections 144, 341, 360, 353, 337 and 320
 inamen se kai gambhir aarope hai jissi sazaa ek saal se adhik he
 a large number of mercury teachers have also been injured
 police kii lathi se kai shikshakon ko chot ai he
 Mercury teachers are not only teaching, they are also employed in the rest of the government survey
 rashtriya press diwas he
 Rewari runs in Haryana
 yahaan ke patrkaar zila sachivalay par kaali pattee baandh kar press diwas manaa rahe the
 He says that journalists are being targeted for writing news
 inkaa kahana he ki rewadi ke ek varisht patrkaar pradeep narayan ne artie main bhrashtachar kii khabar chhap di thi
 After which the administration took the journalist on target and made a case by making him an RTA broker
 edisi daftar se jo press note jari hua tha, usamen likhaa tha ki patrkaar pradeep narayan ne dalal kii bhoomika nibhaate hue farji haivi driving license banavaa lee thi
 It is not clear whether the case has been filed against the alleged RTA employee or not
 tippaniyan Journalist Pradeep says that the administration showed evidence
 patrakaron kaa kahana he ki prashasan is tarah ke cese mukademon se press ko daraa rahaa he
 Every day a group of students from some state keeps emailing us
 ye wo chaatr hai jo pariksha dekar riselt kaa intazaar kar rahe hote hai or riselt aa jaataa he to jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hote hai
 Today a message came that we are 78 candidates, who got the Civil Aviation DGCA under ssc mts 2016
 28 april 2018 ko hi antim parinaam aa gaya tha magar abhi tak jwining nahin hui he
 April to November has arrived
 jab dijisie main phone karte hai to koi jawaab nahin he
 Sometimes it is said that your vacancy has expired
 ham kaaphi pareshaan hai
 One such letter has come from Madhya Pradesh
 chaatro ko lagata he ki agar chunaav ke dabaav main hi rigelt aa jaataa to acha rahata
 Students are told that the result is not coming due to the code of conduct
 is baat ko lekar chaatro ko andeshaa he ki chunaav biit jane par phir khel ho jayega or riselt lambey samay ke liye atka diya jayega
 Don't know the results isliye ve baar baar likh rahe hai ki ek baar prime time main dikhaa dijie
 It is not possible to appear every now and then because you know that this problem is so rare that i do not even have the resources to cover it
 lakhon kii sankhya main desh bhar main chaatr pareshaan hai
 No one is going to ask
 aap is patr ko suniye
 Students have written but the voice of our colleague
 aapako andaaza hoga ki noujvaan kin halaat se guzar rahe hote hai
 Therefore, these mercury teachers reached thousands of people in the state's foundation day celebrations and started shouting slogans
 kaale jhande dikhaae
 Their fierceness can be understood, because you can imagine how the teacher of primary school, who teaches for Rs 6000, would have won
 isliye ye kaale jhande dikhaa rahe honge lekin tabhi vahaan par lathi charge ho gai
 You see in these pictures how the police are running and killing them
 paara shikshakon kii maang he ki jis tarah se chhattisgarh main aath saal tak asthaayee kaam karne ke baad permanent ho jaataa he, usee tarah jharkhand main bhi niti bane
 The salary of mercury teachers in Chhattisgarh has gone from 23 to 26 thousand, yet it is fine, but in Jharkhand, we do not survive in the salary of 6 to 8 thousand
 8 november ko inaki mulaakaat mukhyamantri se hui thi magar kuch sahmati nahin ban saki
 Even in Bihar, the mercury teacher is found to be 22,000, so why the mercury teacher of Chhattisgarh gets 8400
 manoj kaa kahana he ki pachaas hazaar paara shikshak ranchi pahunch gaye the
 This type of problem is in many states
 sarkaar naukari dene ke naam par kai tarah kii chaalaaki karti he
 People take government jobs in the hope that it will become permanent but does not happen
 theke par rakhe jane vaale aise karmchaariyon kii sthiti behad kharaab hoti he
 They work in very little salary for many years
 15 saal se paara shikshakon kaa andolan chal rahaa he
 After teaching so many years, he has reached a salary of 10 000
 ranchi se harbans ne bataaya he ki kareeb 300 paara shikshakon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he or unhen redcross sosayadi main rakhaa gaya
 Many mercury teachers were caught on the way
 redcross ke campus main adaalat lagi or kareeb 300 logon ko jail bhej diya gaya he
 Manoj says that 1000 are kept in Khelgaon
 in shikshakon par dhara 144, 341, 360, 353, 337 or 320 ke tahat aarope lagaae gaye hai
 Many of these are serious charges, the punishment of which is more than a year
 badi sankhya main paara shikshak ghayal bhi hue hai
 Police teachers have hurt many teachers
 paara shikshak padhaate hi nahin hai, sarkaar ke baaki survey main bhi lagaaye jate hai
 It is National Press Day
 haryana ke rewadi chalate hai
 Journalists here were celebrating Press Day by tying a black stripe on the District Secretariat
 unka kahana he ki khabar likhane ke kaaran patrakaron ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 They say that Pradeep Narayan, a senior journalist from Rewari, had published the news of corruption in the RTA
 jiske baad prashasan ne patrkaar ko hi target par le liya or use artie kaa dalal banaakar cese kar diya
 In the press note issued from the ADC office, it was written that the journalist Pradeep Narayan had played a role of a broker and got a fake heavy driving license
 yah saaf nahin he ki kathith rup se is aarope main artie kaa koi karmchaaree tha yaa nahin, uske khilaaf cese hua he yaa nahin
 The comments patrkaar pradeep kaa kahana he ki prashasan saboot dikhaae
 Journalists say the administration is scaring the press with such case lawsuits

 asal main 'yuddh' kaa pramukh mudda yahi he ki party koun chalaaegaa
 The young chief minister wants the candidates to be selected for the elections, and his father's closest aides Chacha Shivpal Yadav and Amar Singh are removed from the party
 mulaayam singh yadav kaa daawa he ki unhen party ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke pad se akhilesh yadav dwaara asanvaidhanik tareeke se hataaya gaya he, or unhen unka pad waapas milanaa chahie

 The speculation has heated up after a video of Nikhil Kumaraswamy, son of Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy went viral
 isamen vah jedies kaaryakartaaon se vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye taiyaar rahane ko kah rahe hai
 Nikhil Kumaraswamy said that elections can be held anytime, next year or even after two-three years
 unhone kaha, ''hamen abhi se shuruyaat kerani hogi
 Not to say that i will do it later
 agle maheene se hi isaki taiyaari shuru kerani he
 Although HD Kumaraswamy has clarified on the statement of son Nikhil, but many meanings are being made in political circles
 kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki jedies congress se alag raah chun rahi he or karnataka main madhyavadhi chunaav ho sakate hai
 The state has a coalition government of Congress and JDS
 vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi lekin congress or jedies ne milakar sarkaar bana lee or bijepi haath malate rah gai
 Looking at the events of the last one year, the relationship between the two parties has not been sweet
 rajya kii raajnneeti main uthal-puthal machi hui he
 The BJP claims that the mlas of the coalition want to turn their back to it
 vahiin congress-jedies kaa aarope he ki bijepi gathbandhan sarkaar giraane ke liye sajeesh rach rahi he
 The results of the Lok Sabha elections gave a major boost to the confidence of both parties in each other
 loksabhaa chunaav main rajya kii 28 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi ne dhamaakedaar pradarshan karte hue 25 siton par kabja jamaaya
 Congress and JDS got 1–1 seats and 1 independents won
 atakalein hai ki jedies or congress kaa gathbandhan tut bhi saktaa he
 Nikhil's video surfaced at a time when JD Chief AH Vishwanath resigned from his post, taking responsibility for poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections
 vishwanath ne aarope lagaaya tha ki loksabhaa chunaav main jamini str par congress-jedies ke bich talmail nahin tha, jiskaa khamiyaja loksabhaa chunaavon main bhugatna padaa
 After these developments, Nikhil's statement coming somewhere indicates that everything is not going well in the alliance
 khabaren yah bhi aati rahi hai ki kam siten laane vaali jedies ko congress alaakaman dwaara mukhyamantri pad diya janaa rajya ke purv mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ko raas nahin aayaa
 He is trying every possible way through his supporters, so that the cm's chair will come back to him
 nikhil ke bayaan par echdi kumaraswami kuch bhi kahen lekin ateet main vah bhi 'gathbandhan ke dard' ko bayanon ke jariye jaahir kar chuke hai
 The triple talaq bill is under discussion in Rajya Sabha
 modi sarkaar kii koshish he ki is bill ko aaj hi paas kara liya jaae
 The NDA is weak in the upper house and meanwhile, before voting, the Bharatiya Janata Party has burglarized the Congress house
 rajyasabha saansad or amethi ke raja kahe jane vaale sanjay singh ne apane pad se istipha de diya he or jald hi bhartiya janata party kaa daaman thamenge
 Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu has also accepted his resignation
 congress ke ghar main bijepi kii sendhamaritin talaak bill loksabhaa se to paas ho gaya he lekin rajyasabha main vipaksh majboot he
 Therefore, the BJP may have problems here and the party now wants to pass the bill in every way
 is bich sanjay singh kaa rajyasabha se istipha dena or bijepi aane kii baat kahana ghar main sendhamari hi kaha jayega
 After the resignation of Sanjay Singh, the Congress now has only 47 mps in the Rajya Sabha
 haalanki, bhaajapa ke baad vah ab bhi sadan main duusari badi party he
 What is now in the Rajya Sabha In an effort to get the status of divorce bill passed, the government's partner Janata Dal Union announced a boycott from the Rajya Sabha on the triple talaq bill
 yani JDU ke 6 saansad bill par voting ke dauraan sadan main nahin honge
 There are a total of 245 mps in Rajya Sabha, with 4 seats still vacant
 yani kul 241 maujuud hai unamem se 6 saansad JDU ke shaamil nahin honge
 This means a total of 235 members in the House, with which Sanjay Singh's resignation has come
 matlab 234 sadsy gine jaaenge
 Now a total figure of 118 is needed for the majority
 abhi agar saaf rukh kii baat karen to congress, aap, AIADMK, TMC, DMK jaisi partiyaan khule taur par iskaa virodh kar rahi hai
 On the other hand, the stand of the BJD, TRS and YSR Congress Party is not clear yet

 These changes will be effective from May 21
 dilli metro ne yah jaankaree di
 Most of the smart card users in Delhi Metro travel regularly and with the opening of even more corridors of the Rapid Metro during the third phase, the fares required for the journey will be higher
 smart card ke liye shuruaati nunatam aid vailu 50 rupee se badhaakar 100 rupee kii gai he or 50 rupee kii vaapasi yogya security raashi main badlaav nahin kiya gaya he
 As a result, the next recharge of minimum add value will be Rs 200 and in this, the value can be added in multiples of Rs 100
 web top ap ke maamle main nunatam aid vailu 100 rupee or 50 rupee ke gunak main daali ja sakegi
 Delhi Metro said that about 1,200 smart cards are returned every day, of which nine percent are purchased and returned on the same day
 isi prakaar 30 pratishat smart card ek hi maheene main kharide or lautaae jate hai
 Due to this, a pile of nine lakh smart cards has been accumulated, which will be made reusable at the cost of DMRC
 smart card kii vaapasi par karrwai kii laagat paanch rupaye se badhaakar 20 rupee kii jaaegi
 The new measures will help the withdrawal system run smoothly

 The United States was deeply alarmed by the fact that Pakistan had built low-capacity nuclear weapons to bridge the gap in the war that India had started under its 'cold start doctrine'
 obama ne navaj ko nae parmaanu hathiyaaron se badhane vaale tanaav ke bare main chetaya
 a joint statement said, "the President has emphasized to avoid any situation in the context of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program that may pose a threat to nuclear security or strategic stability
" 'navaj ne guuruuvaar ko white house ke ovel offis main obama se mulaakaat kii
 After this meeting, a joint statement was issued, in which Pakistan managed to get the talk of india-pakistan talks to settle all other issues including Kashmir

 After that they used to hit the ball towards me to take a catch

 After that i was found doing only two things, either taking a catch or erasing the stains of the bike

 ‘agar aap duniyabar ke logon ke chehron ko dekhen to paaenge ki vahaan se hansi gum ho chuki he
 If cricket can bring a smile to people's faces, then understand that we have done our work
 ’ Dhoni says, 'when i was younger, one of my senior players often parked their beautiful bikes in the play-ground where i used to stand for fielding
 uske baad ve gend ko kaich lene ke liye meri taraf maaraa karte the
 'if i would have missed a catch and it would have been on the bike, i would have had to fix the scratch on the bike and probably since then i have practiced not to miss the catch
 uske baad main do hi chiz karte hue paaya gaya yaa to kaich lete yaa bike ke daag mitaate

 Whenever it is said that who loves the child more than the mother and father, then we all declare the mother the winner without any hesitation
 aksar pita ke pyaar ko andekha kar diya jaataa he
 Probably because he does not tell or express his every feeling
 
 
 sirf chupchaap kar jate hai
 But think of you, can a child be raised without the affection of a father? No
 
 
 kabhi nahin
 That silent love of the father is also as important as the moment the mother is seen every moment
 ek bachche kaa bhavishya kaaphi had tak pita ke maargdarshan par hi nirbhar karata he
 Infosys founder and CEO NR Narayana Murthy has written a letter to his daughter
 is khat main unhone wo sari baaten likhi hai jo ek pita apni beti ko kahana chahta he
 Some fathers also say but some are kept in mind
 ek beti ke liye ye khat padhanaa jitna jaruri he, utana hi ek pita ke liye bhi
 Narayana Murthy has written in his letter that Akshata is his first child and his life changed forever from the day he was born
 ye khat sudhaa menon kii kitaab legasy main prakashit hua
 This book stores the letters and messages of famous parents to their daughters
 akshata, pita banane ke baad meri jindagi kuch is tarah se badal gai jiske bare main main kabhi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 i became a person i had never been before
 tumhaare janm se mere jivan main khushiyaan to ai hin saath hi bahut badi jimmedaari bhi ai
 Now i was not just a husband, son and an employee of a fast growing company
 ab main ek beti kaa pita ban chukaa tha, jise jindagi main apni beti kii har ummid par khara utarana tha
 Your birth proved to be a benchmark in my life in every way
 tumhaari maa or main un dinon kariyar ko lekar stregal kar rahe the
 Were trying to establish their feet
 tumhaare janm ke do maheene baad ham hubli se mumbai aa gaye or yahaan aakar hamen samaj aayaa ki kariyar or bachche kii parvarish, donon ekasaath kar paanaa mushkil he
 Then we decided that this initial year you should stay with your grandparents in Hubli
 ye bahut hi kathin faisla tha
 i would take a flight to Belgaum every weekend and then take a car from there to meet you
 mere liye ye kharch uthaanaa mushkil tha lekin main kya karata, tumhen dekhe bina main rah bhi nahin saktaa tha
 i am often asked what education i have given to my children
 main ye sawaal karne waalon se hameshaa kahata hum ki ye sabase badi jimmedaari tumhaari maa ne nibhaai or bahut hi achche se nibhaai
 He told you about human values
 unhone tumhen or rohan ko hameshaa saadagi kaa paath sikhaaya
 You probably remember that incident when we were in Bangalore
 tumhaara sellection skool drama ke liye hua tha or tumhen ek special dress kii jarurat thi
 At that time we did not have so much money that we could spend anything on anything other than basic needs
 tumhaari maa ne tumhen drama main hissaa lene se manaa kar diya
 Although you did not say anything at that time, but later you told me that you did not like to say such a mother
 par akshata hamen pataa tha ki tum ek na ek din is tapasya ke mahatv ko jarur samjhogi
 i was sure that you would understand the beauty of simplicity
 kuch samay baad bhale hi hamaare paas paise aa gaye lekin hamaara lifestil tab bhi saadhaaran hi rahaa
 i remember there was a lot of talk between your mother and me about sending children to school by car
 main chahta tha ki ab tum car se skool jaaya karo to tumhaari maa ne saaf manaa kar diya
 She kept sending you with her friends in a rickshaw and then you made so many friends on this excuse
 
 
 he na
 There is no happiness in the world more than simplicity and it has no value
 
 
 tum mujhase aksar poocha karti thi ki hamaare ghar main televijan kyon nahin he jabaki tumhaare saare doston tivi par dekhi gai chizon ke bare main hi baaten karte rahete the
 Your mother had long ago decided that we would not have television at home
 is samay ko ham padhai karne, discshan karne or duusare kaamon ko puraa karne main lagaayenge
 You must have known that when a father leaves his daughter, there are so many mixed feelings in his mind
 wo is baat se chidhata he kiab uski beti kaa pyaar koi or bhi saajha karne aa gaya he
 Let me tell you, i also got a little sad when you told me that you have found your soul mate
 par jab main rishi se mila to mujhe ye samajhane main der nahin lagi ki tumne use kyon chunaa he
 He is smart, he is intelligent but most importantly he is honest
 kuch vakt pehle hi tumne meri tarakkee kar di or main naanaa ban gaya
 When your daughter Krishna was picked up for the first time in my lap, i cannot say in words what i felt
 akshata, tumhen bhi ye baat pataa he ki hamaare paas yahi ek duniya he
 But there are different types of crises in this world
 ye tumhaari jimmedaari he ki tum krishna ko ek aisi duniya do jahaan koi takalif nahin ho
 Whatever you got from us, you give Krishna better than that
 meri bacchee, apana dhyaan rakhana

 Initial investigation is suspected of suicide by consuming poison
 philhal donon shavon ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya gaya he or maamle kii tafteesh jari he
 Amidst the increasing incidents of human trafficking, the police of the national capital Delhi has started Operation Milap to introduce people who have been away from their loved ones
 isamen bacchon kii sankhya zyada he jo kisi ke jhaanse main aakar parivaar ke dur ho gaye hai
 The crime branch has so far introduced 333 children from different parts of the country to their families under this operation
 dilli police alag alag jagahon se bacchon ko baraamad karke bacchon kii photo or anya jaankaree website par aplod karti he, jisase parivaar ke log bacchon tak pahunch saken
 Most of the children are lured or seduced and are pushed into the roadside begging by railway trafficking gangs at railway stations, bus stands and other crowded places
 aaparishan milaap ke tahat 1 janvari se 7 july ke bich parivaar se milwaaye gaye 333 bacchon main se zyaadaatar bachche pashchimi uttar pradesh, bihar, odisha se hai
 The police have also introduced 57 people from Delhi to their estranged loved ones
 iname 14 naaballig or 37 mahilaayein hai, jinhen naukari kaa jhansa diya gaya tha
 Thousands of children are still not known
 Thousands of children are still missing
 akele dilli kii baat karen to saal 2019 main abhi tak 2324 bacchon ke laapata hone kii shikaayat darj kii gai he
 Of these, 1241 children were traced, while others could not collect any information
 gauratlab he ki saal 2018 main 6541 bacchon kii gumshudagi kii shikaayatein darj hui thim
 Out of these 6146 children have been traced
 bhayaavah he gumshudagi kaa aankadabacchon kii gumshudagi kaa ye aankada jitna daraavna he utana hi hairaan karne vaala bhi
 How thousands of innocent children are separated from their families
 hairaani kii baat ye bhi he ki sabase zyada gumshudagi ke maamle 12 se 18 saal tak ke bacchon kii taadaad adhik he
 Looking at the figures, in 2018 3653 complaints of missing children of 12 to 18 years old were filed
 rojaanaa bacchon kaa gaayab hona, khaas taur par dilli main missing bacchon ke ye aankade mata pita ke liye ek chetavanee hai
 Also a big challenge for Delhi Police as well
 dilli main teenon nagar nigam ke ekikaran kii maang ko lekar raajnneeti tej hoti ja rahi he
 Defying the demand of Delhi BJP state president Manoj Tiwari, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party have completely rejected the slogan of 'one MCD'
 bijepi ko gherne ke liye congress or 'aap' netaa sur se sur milaate nazar aa rahe hai
 On the question of uniting the three municipal corporations of Delhi, Congress leader Ajay Makan said that "there are many small corporations inside the country"
 dilli main jab choti si nai dilli palika chal sakati he to emsidi ko kya dikkat he
 He said that for corruption in MCD there is parking mafia, advertisement is mafia, toll tax is stolen
 ekikaranaka bahaanaa banane ke bajaay bijepi ko emsidi main bhrashtachar band karne kii zarurat he
 "according to the Congress, BJP is seeking integration to divert attention from the real issues
 vahiin aam aadmi party ke pravaktaa ashutosh ne sidhe manoj tiwari par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki "emsidi main baithebijapi ke parshadone kaam karnaa band kar diya he or emsidi ko lut kaa adda bana diya gaya he
 As long as there is corruption, there will be no benefit from uniting the MCD
 manoj tiwari ko samajhnaa chahie ki nigamon ko 3 yaa 1 karne se halaat thik nahi honge
 The Aam Aadmi Party has asked Manoj Tiwari that he promised to clean up Delhi's garbage in 3 months before the elections but why has it not happened so far? desh ke alag-alag hisson se kisaan aatmahatya ke samachar aa rahe hai
 The Supreme Court has also ordered an inquiry into the issue
 sansad main pehle hi bahes ho chuki he
 In such a situation, does the Modi government have any formula that can turn the situation in the right direction
 desh ke krishi mantri radha mohan singh se pramukh samvaadadaata piyush babele or santosh kumaar ne inhen sab vishyon par baat kii
 The government is facing criticism from the Parliament to the Supreme Court on farmer suicides
 in halaat se aap kaise nibatenge?agar aap gaur se dekhen to kisaan aatmahatya kii sabase zyada khabar ek hi rajya maharashtra se aa rahi he
 This state has had the highest investment on irrigation in the last 10 years, yet the situation is bad
 ham maharashtra sarkaar ke saath milakar kaam kar rahe hai
 Do you have a concrete strategy to prevent suicide? Our first attempt is to reduce the cost of production of the farmer
 doosraa kaam kheton kii upaj badhanaa he or teesraa kaam uski upaj ko sahi bazaar mulya par bikwaana he
 Concrete work has started in all three directions
 aazaadee ke baad se desh main ab tak bhartiya krishi anusandhan parishad (isiaar) ek maatr sanstha thi, ab aisi do or sansthaaon kii sthapana ko manjuuri di ja chuki he
 The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Vikas Yojana has been approved in principle
 isse aatmahatyaayein kaise rukengi?ye sari chijen pradhanmantri gram sinchai yojana ke tahat puri kii jaaengi
 Since independence, till date only 40% of the country's agricultural area is irrigated
 is yojana ke tahat baaki 60 fisadi kheton tak bhi sinchai kaa pani pahunchaana he
 Reaching the water will reduce the cost to the farmer, increase yields and prevent drought
 modi ji ke netritv main aane vaali yah yojana desh kii ab tak kii sabase krantikari yojana hogi
 For this, a cabinet note is being prepared and advice has been sought from the Chief Ministers of the state
 kai mukhyamantri apane suzav bhej bhi chuke hai
 Soon, the detailed plan of the scheme will be in front of the country and water will reach every field
 desh ke sinchai kshetra ko maujuuda str kaa dhai guna karne main lakhon karod ru
 Investment will be needed from where will the government bring this much money? Such model has been successful in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat before
 nadiyon ko jodgaye kii yojanaayen isamen bahut madadgaar hai
 As far as money is concerned, it is the job of the Finance Ministry to look into it after cabinet approval
 vaise bhi kisi pariyojna kaa sara nivesh pehle din nahin aa jaataa
 Resources will also be available over time
 kisaanon ke liye in chah maheenon main or koun-koun se thos kadam uthaae?hamaari sarkaar ko pehali chunauti kamjor monsoon kii mili
 But we immediately prepared an emergency plan
 hamane dijal par sabsidi di or beej par sabsidi main 50 fisadi kaa ijapha kiya
 17 in the rain in the buying season
 6 fisadi kii kami ke baavjood utpaadan main sirf 6
 There was a reduction of 9 percent
 iske alaava sarkaar ne 500 karod ru
 Has created a price stabilization fund
 isamen keemten bahut zyada kam hone par sarkaar uchit keemat par kisaan se upaj kharidegi, taaki kisaan ghate main na chale jaaen
 At the time of price increase, the government will bring the produce to the market so that the prices do not increase much and the public does not suffer
