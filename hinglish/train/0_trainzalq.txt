 british sansad kii kaarywahi 3 sitambar se shuru honi thi
 But to prevent opposition leaders from bringing the bill, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has bet on suspending Parliament
 darasal agar sansad chalegi hi nahin to vipakshi netaa koi bill pesh nahin kar paaenge
 Boris Johnson had to get permission from Queen Elizabeth II of Britain for this
 maharani elizabeth ne 14 oktober tak sansad ko nilambit karne kii anumati de di he
 However, this entire process is being viewed with suspicion, and it is being called the end of the democratic process
 samachar agency royatres ke mutabik agar vipakshi saansad saansad bregsit deal ko aage badhaane vaale bill ko paas karaane main kaamyaab ho jate hai, to british pradhanmantri boris johnson samay se pehle aam chunaav kara sakate hai
 It is believed that the election will be announced in the next two days
 ye bhi anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he ki britain ke aam chunaav 31 oktober se pehle karaae ja sakate hai, taaki 31 oktober kii dedline se pehle hi bregsit ko anjaam diya ja sake
 According to British law, PM Johnson will have to get the support of two-thirds of the mps to conduct elections ahead of time
 ab piem johnson ke liye ye samarthan hasil karnaa chunauti jaisaa he
 Boris Johnson has promised the British that the UK will complete the Breguit process before October 31, no matter what
 ab is vaade ko puraa karne ke liye ve kisi bhi had tak jane ko taiyaar hai

 Former India captain Rahul Dravid has appealed to the ICC to rethink the rule of raising the maximum four fielder outside the radius of 30 yards after the end of the World Cup, amid the full batting dominance of the ball in ODI cricket
 
 is nae niyam ke tahat puri pari ke dauraan hameshaa kam se kam paanch fielder kaa 30 gaj ke daayre ke bheetar khadaa hona jaruri he
 Following this rule, 100 times or more were scored in the final 10 overs 17 times in the league stage of the current World Cup, compared to only six times in the 2011 World Cup
 maujuuda toornament ke lig charan main hi 388 chakke pad chuke hai jabaki 2011 ke puure toornament main sirf 258 chakke lage the
 "ESPN Cricinfo" quoted Dravid as saying, "five fielders need to be looked at within 30 yards
" mujhe lagata he ki is par punarvichaar karne kii jarurat he
 The veteran batsman said, "there is no doubt that there is a lot of pressure and the bowlers are not able to deal with it
" isse bahut bade score ban rahe hai or mujhe nahin lagata ki yah jaruri he ki yah khel ke liye acha ho
 In the first 10 overs, only two fielders are allowed to stand outside the radius of 30 yards while three players can be left out during the five-over batting power play
 pari ke baaki overon main adhiktam chaar khilaadi 30 gaj ke daayre ke baahar khadey ho sakate hai
 Rahul said, 'we did not get to see very close matches, which increases the thrill
 hameshaa chakke or chauke padane se hi romaanch nahin badhata

 Dravid also supported the presence of associate teams in the World Cup
 rahul ne kaha, 'main associat tiimon ke is toornament main khilne or unhen prayek mauka dene kaa samarthan karuunga

 This means that the NDA will have to take the support of at least four other regional parties to form the government

 pdf Did 5 soldiers die in Srinagar terror attack because most of them did not have weapons
 ye sawaal ek bada mudda ban gaya he
 This question has arisen due to an order of the Jammu and Kashmir Police, in which CRPF personnel have been asked to keep sticks only
 ajeeb baat ye he ki is mudde ko lekar kendriya grahamantri or jammu-kashmir ke grih rajyamantri virodhabhasi baaten kar rahe hai
 The suicide attack on Wednesday in Bemani area of srinagar has given rise to many controversies
 is hamale main siarpief ke 5 javaanon ne apni jaan ganvaai
 Questions arose how just two terrorists killed so many of our soldiers
 jammu-kashmir police ne siarpief ke javaanon ko sirf lathi ke dam par shanti behaal rakhane kaa farmaan jari kiya tha
 Till date, there is a copy of the police order issued on March 1, which states that the CRPF personnel who will be deployed to handle law and order will not carry weapons, they only have to keep sticks or cane
 ab bhala lathi ke dam par aatmghaatee hamalaavaron kii riflon kaa saamana kaise hota
 So was this the reason that by the time our soldiers could handle the front with weapons, by then 5 soldiers had fallen victim to the firing of terrorists
 jammu kashmir se lekar dilli tak, guuruuvaar ko srinagar hamale kaa hi mudda chaaya rahaa
 In the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, the BJP, Panthers Party and the disenchanted mlas created a ruckus, the BJP and Shiv Sena raised sharp questions in the two houses of Parliament on the wavering attitude of the central government but the answer to this question was nowhere that our soldiers were killed
 How long will the hollow message of peace be given at a price

 After the meeting of the four Naxalite affected states, the Center said that it is ready to hold talks with the Maoists provided they renounce violence '
 ‚Äô grih mantri pi chidambaram ne kaha, ‚Äònaksal prabhavit rajyon kii binah par do din pehle sammelan main bhaag lene vaale sabhi mukhyamantriyon kii ore se meri sabhi naksaliyon se apil he ki yadi aap hinsa chhod dete hai
 
 
 We are not asking you to do anything more, if you give up violence then we are willing to talk to you on any issue
 ‚Äô vah naksali prabhavit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon kii baithak ke baad samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet kar rahe the
 The meeting was not attended by the Chief Ministers of Bihar and Jharkhand, Nitish Kumar and Shibu Soren respectively
 nitish kumaar ne patna main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki vah lambey samay tak patna se baahar nahin ja sakate the kyonki aaj rajya cabinet kii baithak he
 Soren cited his illness and expressed his inability to attend the meeting and had sent two of his deputy chief ministers to the meeting
 rail mantri mamata banerjee ke kaaran baithak se nitish kumaar ke dur rahane kii repotare kii prishthbhumi main chidambaram ne unki gaiyr maujuudagi ko taalane kaa prayaas kiya
 Chidambaram said that Nitish Kumar had told him in Delhi on Sunday that he had a pre-determined schedule and that he might not be able to attend the Kolkata meeting
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòunke varisht adhikari yahaan hai
 i can either go to Patna to discuss the Maoist issue or he can come to Delhi
 yah koi mudda nahin he
 On the Naxalite issue, the Home Minister said, "the condition" is that the Maoists must stop the violence
 grih mantri ne kaha, ‚Äòdurbhagyavash pichhali apilon ko thukraa diya gaya
 So as long as Naxalites indulge in violence, we are obliged to continue the operation

 West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya also attended the meeting
 bihar ke mukhyamantri ke bayaan ke bare main puche jane par chidambaram ne kaha, ‚Äòakele bal prayog se samasya hal nahin hogi
 We all agree on this
 lekin hinsa par kaabo paane ke liye or naagarik prashasan kii pun: sthapana ke liye, bal prayog jaruri he
 Nitish Kumar said that the Maoist problem cannot be solved through the use of force
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòyadi maovadi hinsa nahin rokte hai to sarkaar ko unke khilaaf saavdhaneepurvak, niyantrit tareeke se or thos abhiyaan jari rakhana chahie
 Soren sent two of his deputy chief ministers, Raghubar Das and Sudesh Mahato, to attend the meeting, while the Bihar government was represented by its home secretary Amir Subhani and DGP Anand Shankar
 baithak main maovadiyon se nipatane ke liye apanaayi ja rahi niti or padosi rajyon ke bich samanvay par vyapak vichaar vimarsh kiya kyonki naksali kai baar ek rajya main hinsa ko anjaam dekar duusare rajya main bhaag jate hai
 Chidambaram told the four Naxalite violence affected states, 'as long as the violence continues, the campaign will continue
 mujhe ummid he ki chah maheene main ham kuch sakaaratmak najeezon ke saath aapke saamne honge
 However, he said, "the objective of the campaign is not to kill anyone but to re-establish civil administration and regain control of Maoist-dominated areas
" ‚Äôgrih mantri ne kaha, ‚Äòham pragati kar rahe hai jo dhimi he lekin satat he or ham ise jari rakhenge
 It is not like a cricket score board where you get results in every over

 After Gunjan Singh passed his matriculation, his father sent him to Patna to prepare for the polytechnic examination
 lekin gunjan kaa padhai main man nahin lag rahaa tha
 He used to go to the cinema to study
 maheene bhar kaa kharch 15 dinon main khatm
 For this, scolding was often heard from the father
 gunjan ke mamaa arun kumaar patna main ejeeniyar the
 One day he narrated the song to his maternal uncle
 mamaa khush hue
 In return, he took the material from Mama to play songs
 yah baat gunjan ke pita gopal singh ko jab maaloom hui to ve bade niraash hue
 Mama then explained that Gunjan wants to become a singer, not an engineer
 gopal singh kehete hai ki shuruyaat main kaaphi takalif hui
 When others came to know about this, he got to hear that the son had gone out
 haalanki unhone gunjan ko paise bhejne phir bhi jari rakhe
 Now Gunjan's success has allayed his worries
 bihar ke navada jile ke govindpur prakhand ke bhavanpur nivasee gunjan kaa naam bhojpuri or magahi ke prasiddh gayakon main shaamil ho gaya he
 Gunjan has sung around 500 songs so far
 isamen bhojpuri or magahi donon shaamil he
 Three Bhojpuri films Udaan, Khuddaar and Naseeb have been released
 iske alaava, 7 mem pistal, kidnaped, main tera beoyafriend jaisi aadha darjan filmon main ve abhi kaam kar rahe hai
 Preparations are also underway for a Magahi film
 atthis varshiya gunjan kaa gane ke kshetra main khyaati paane kaa safar aasaan nahin rahaa
 Initially he used to sing smooth music and Magahi songs in the villages
 lekin magahi gane kii sidi banaanevaale log dilchaspee nahin dikhaate the
 Studio's teammates advised to sing Bhojpuri
 tab parijanon kii madad se veri good lagata naam se ek casette nikaala
 However he did not run
 gunjan kanvad ke dinon main geet gaate hue paidal devgarh jate the
 Then the idea came in my mind to get an album of Kavad Yatra
 saat saal pehle bol bam boli naam se ek album nikaala
 The album came out
 sava lakh se adhik sidi bik gayi
 For this he worked hard
 devgarh main maheene bhar rahakar use khud dukandaaron tak pahunchaaya
 Many more albums were released after that
 do saal baad aayaa ek vivaadit gaanaa gunjan kii lokapriyata kii vajah bana
 His songs like Padhe Na Jaib Padhaib, Coaching Class Kareke, Kahe Gaye, Chumma Maange Mastarawa Matric Kareke made his name known from village village to the city
 yah shaadi-vivaah, arcestra, deje, party samarohon kaa pasandida gaanaa ban gaya
 Many songs that came after this increased his height
 2019 main kakolat ke jharnaa albumamen tore khatir ab jeena he raniya, tore khatir ab maranaa ge, chal bihar navada dhumaivu, tora kakolat ke jharnaa ge magahi gane ne khub vaahvahee dilaai
 She also made her presence felt in the acting world due to the confidence that came during acting in the album

 They have an equal grip on both languages
 ek unki ghar kii bhashaa he to ek kaam kii bhashaa
 Some of his fans believe and say that there is no linguistic difference in his songs
 darasal, gunjan kaa bachapan se sangeet se lagaav tha
 He used to sing hymns in the hymns of the village
 ek baar ve nanihaal gaye the
 a play was being played there
 paradaa girane ke baad duusare kalakaar ke aane kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, Gunjan was given a chance to sing on the mic
 unke gane se khush hokar aayojakon ne unhen paanch rupye kaa inaam diya
 Since then, he has become a necessity for the organizers every year
 dekhen to gunjan kii paariwarik prishthbhumi nitant saadhaaran rahi he
 Father Gopal Singh is a farmer and mother Veena Devi has been a homemaker
 ve do bhai hai
 One brother Naveen Singh is an engineer

 Decision to become a singer without giving up studies without the consent of the Chhatrasangharpita

 capies gil nahin rahe
 With this, a precious chapter of hockey also ended
 bhartiya hockey sangh ke purv adhyaksh gil ke kaarykaal main hockey ne kai utaar-chadhaav dekhe
 There was a time when Gill's reaction to hockey was considered very important
 2004 ke athens olympix kii team ke chayan ko lekar (olympix se 100 din pehle tak khaaskar dhanraj pillai ke chayan ko lekar) bavaal machaa hua tha
 Gill became famous for dropping players from the team
 gil apane faisalon kii safaai dena zaruri nahin samajhate the
 Therefore, it was difficult to get answers on their one-sided decisions
 NDTV se is samvaadadaata ko capies gil kaa intervyuu lekar aana tha
 Gill, after convincing a lot, gave his consent for the interview
 NDTV or Zee ke samvaadadaata shivendra singh ko ek saath 15 minute kaa vakt mila
 When Gill sat in front of two cameras at Gill's bungalow, we decided that Shivendra would have sharp questions and i would try to keep him in the interview
 gil bahut gusse main zarur the
 But on that day he kept repeating the lines of poems of Milton or WB Yeats, sometimes to keep his words logical
 gil ko kai kavitaayen yaad thim
 He was well versed in English language
 gil kaa media ke saath sambandh bhi utaar-chadhaav bharaa rahaa
 He had many good friends in the media
 wo hameshaa aarope lagaate rahe ki media hockey ke saath nyaay nahin karata
 Whenever he was reminded that the media has given a lot of attention to hockey, he would say, "this is the compulsion of the media
" kya media bharat-pakistan match kii upeksha kar saktaa he? media hockey ko tabhi cover karti he jab wo use andekha nahin kar sakati
 " gil gussell to the lekin unamem hasya kii kami nahin thi
 It was 12 o'clock at the end of one of his press conferences
 us press conference main media or gil ke bich tikhe sawaal-jawaab se maahaul tanaav bharaa ho gaya
 Then senior journalist Harpal Singh Bedi (late) came inside the room
 gil ne unhen tapaak se aade haathon liya, "bedi sahab ab aa rahe hai jab sab khatm ho gaya?" bedi ne usee andaaz main unhen jawaab diya, "aapane aise vakt par press conference rakhi
 It was only after 12 o'clock

 Former hockey president Gil could also have taken the joke on Sportingly
 gil ke vakt bhartiya hockey ne utaar-chadhaav ke kai daur dekhe
 Indian hockey team became Asian Games champion after 32 years (1998), India defeated Australia on its own land, Indian hockey team many times indicated the return of its heyday
 lekin hameshaa gil ke kuch faisalon ne vivaadon kaa pitara khol diya
 During his 14-year tenure, the Indian hockey team failed to qualify for the Olympics for the first time (2008 Beijing Olympics) and Indian hockey looked to be at its lowest level

 lekin kabhi unka ahm, kabhi team or corporates kii kamazori, kabhi koching ke galat faisale or kabhi media or spancers kii berukhi ne hockey ko vahaan nahin pahunchane diya jahaan wo pahunch sakati thi
 Gill also went on to claim that he launched the Premier Hockey League before the Indian Premier League of Cricket

 The matter of copying may seem too much to cricket fans

 The presidency of Parliamentary Assessment Committee Manohar Joshi has asked the former Central Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan to appear before the committee
 sansadeey samiti desh main gahraate enpie(non parforming asset) sankat kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Sources have told India Today that the chairman of the committee has written a letter to Rajan on August 7 and expressed hope that Rajan will appear before the committee soon and in which direction the committee is facing the problem of NPA and efforts to fight it Will share my opinion on gauratlab he ki raghuram rajan kaa rigerv bank kaa kaarykaal sitambar 2016 main puraa hua tha lekin kendra sarkaar ne unke kaarykaal ko badhaane kii pahal nahin kii thi
 Due to this, Raghuram Rajan preferred the research in the US University after ending the term of the Reserve Bank and after that the Central Government appointed Urjit Patel as the new Governor
 ise padhen: jab puri duniya thi bharat ke khilaaf, tab, vaajapeyi ne aise sanbhali thi arthvyavasthasutron kaa daawa he ki samiti ko raghuram rajan kii kaabiliyat par bharosa he or isiilie vah chaahati he ki jald se jald enpie se ladane kii koshishon ko sahi disha di jaae

 Read this: Prime Minister Modi's speech from Red Fort will prove to be the election bugle of 2019? It is important that the step of writing a letter to Rajan by the chairman of the parliamentary committee was taken recently when Arvind Subramaniam, the chief economic advisor of the central government, in front of the committee Put his side on NPA
 sutron kaa daawa he ki subramanyam ne samiti ko bataaya ki enpie kii samasya ko sahi tareeke se pahchaanane kaa shrey purv arabiai governor raghuram rajan ko jaataa he or unase behatar yah koi nahin jaanata ki aakhir desh main enpie kii samasya kaise itani gambhir ho gai
 Read this: The NPA became a burden, the government's sweat in improving the health of banks
 Apart from this, Subramaniam claimed that during his tenure, Rajan had taken an important initiative to solve this problem
 gauratlab he ki purv governor raghuram rajan ne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan kaha tha ki sarkari bainkon kaa vilay karne se pehle unke non parforming esets (enpie) ke masale kaa samaadhaan kiya janaa chahie
 Their books should be kept clean, so that their health can improve and they have sufficient capital
 rajan ke mutabik, 'meraa maananaa he ki bainkon kaa nideshak mandal sakriy ho or usamen peshewar log shaamil hon, taaki unki sehat ko phir se sudhara ja sake
 Constant efforts should be made to professionalize them and remove political interference from them
 ek baar hamaare aisa kar lene ke baad bainkon ke vilay ke liye yah ek adarsh sthiti hogi
 Rajan said this in response to a question about the government's efforts to promote the integration of state-run banks
 gauratlab he ki rajan ke suzav ke baavjood bainkon ke ekikaran kii prakriya bina is suzav par gaur karte hue kii gai or aaj bainkon kii sthiti pehle se or kharaab ho chuki he

 There was a huge uproar in the Lok Sabha on Thursday over the Ishrat Jahan case
 ek taraf jahaan bijepi or congress ne ek-duusare par aarope-pratyaropon kii barsaat kii, to duusari taraf grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki sari duniya aatank se grasit he or isapar raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 However, he said that the previous government had made a mess in this case and got the affidavit changed
 unhone kaha ki is cese main siem modi(gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri) ko fansaane kii koshish kii gai thi
 Rajnath said that from what Headley said, there is a clear indication of Ishrat being a terrorist
 grih mantri ne kaha ki congress ne bhagava aatankwaad kii baat kahi thi
 'congress engaged in doing Ishrat work', BJP MP Anurag Thakur attacked Congress on Ishrat Jahan case
 unhone kaha ki jo kaam ishrat nahin kar pai, use karne main ab congress jute gai he
 He said that 'everyone told the former central government, even the whole world told that Ishrat is a terrorist but her case was fought by NCP leaders
 hamaari ibi or ro ko purv congress sarkaar ne khatm kiya he
 The country will never forgive the Congress government for this
 'congressi netaa ne juthi report ke liye kiya tha satyapal ko phonishrat jahaan cese kii jaanch karne vaale tatkaaleen ipies satyapal singh ne loksabhaa main kaha ki ek varisht congress netaa ne mujhe phone karavaaya or kaha ki aapako kisi na kisi prakaar se is cese ko jhootha sabit karnaa he or aapako gujarat kaa siem bananaa he
 In spite of this, the Congress mps created a ruckus and asked to name the leader but Satyapal did not take the name
 CM modi ko maarane ai thi ishartaishrat jahaan cese par loksabhaa main bijepi ke saansad nishikant dube ne kaha ki maut kaa saudagar kehane vaali is congress ne kya maut kaa sauda kiya tha
 The BJP MP said in the Lok Sabha that Ishrat was a Lashkar terrorist and had come to kill the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar ko jo ibi kii report mili, usee par karrwai karte hue hamane aatankiyon ko maut ke ghat utaara
 We and our government are committed to ending terrorism and if we have to die for it, we will not be averse to it
 upie sarkaar ko 2009 ke baad jab laga ki narendra modi piem ban sakate hai to unhone unhen jail main daalane ke liye ishrat jahaan encounter mudda uthaa diya
 He said that everyone is using the Ishrat case as a vote bank

 The Congress knows the truth that Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi will clash in the 2014 mission
 modi ke nishane par manmohan sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se lekar gandhi parivaar hoga hi
 But Rahul Gandhi will have to sing the praises of the same Manmohan government, during which time the river of corruption cost dearness to the common man
 aise main rahul gandhi ko bhi modi kii jarurat hogi, jiske jariye gujarat kii aag ko desh main failaate hue modi ke jariye to bataaen lekin modi kii gujarat jeet ke myne chupa le jaaen
 In fact, the way Jairam Ramesh made Modi's bogey and intimidated the Congress, there is no fear of Gujarat riots or communal Modi
 balki modi ke badhate kad kii aisi chunauti he jo congress kii bebasii ubharti he
 Jairam counted Modi's specialty - Modi is a wonderful campaigner
 -modi chunaavon main prabandhan or vichaardhaara ke str par congress ke liye chunauti sabit honge
 However Jairam also mentioned that - Modi is Bhasmasura
 -wo sachmuch pehle bhartiya fasivadi hai
 -corporate also supported Hitler
 yani aane vaale vakt main modi kaa matlab bhartiya raajnneeti main kya hone vaala he iske sanket jairam ne khule taur par diya
 But the Congress does not consider its prince as a strategy to take the field of challenge because it will end Rahul Gandhi's prince's aura and break the myth of Congress
 lekin congress kii mushkil he kii gandhi parivaar se itar congress he nahin or nai paristhiti main pehali baar modi se chota kad bijepi kaa ho rahaa he
 That is why the last truth Jayaram spoke to Modi's love for corporate is also a threat to Manmohan's economics and every Congressman is blinded by this truth

 '' kapil mishra ke aaropon ko aam aadmi party main arvind kejariwal ke kareebi ke saath virdohi ho chuke kumaar vishwaas ne bhi khaarij kar diya he, lekin in aaropon se saafe ho rahaa he ki jis tareeke se arvind kejariwal apane virodhiyon par ab tak aarope lagaate rahe hai, unke saath bhi unke sahyogi ne vahi kiya he
 Even before Kapil Mishra accused Kejriwal, Kumar Vishwas and Manish Sisodia reached Kejriwal's house with his wife
 ghanton baithak chali
 Kapil Mishra's CM Arvind Kejriwal was accused after Delhi's deputy CM came out and all the allegations were denied
 mana ja rahaa tha ki kapil mishra kumaar vishwaas ke kareebi hai isliye unako mantri pad se hataaya gaya lekin kumaar vishwaas ne apane nae kareebi nahi balki apane puraane kareebi main bharosa dikhaaya
 This is the first time someone has directly accused Kejriwal of corruption
 ab tak virdohi bhi sidhe kejariwal par bhrashtachar kaa aarope nahin laga paae

 unhone iske khilaaf awaz uthaai to unhen mantrimandal se nikaal diya gaya haalanki aam aadmi party ke baaki netaa in aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataa rahe hai
 It was believed that Kapil Mishra was close to Kumar Vishwas, so he was removed from the ministerial post but Kumar Vishwas showed confidence in his old close but not his new close
 yah pehali baar he jab kejariwal par kisi ne karpshan kaa sidhaa aarope lagaaya ho
 Till now, even the opponents could not directly accuse Kejriwal of corruption
 vaise kapil mishra ne kejariwal par lagaae aaropon kaa koi saboot pesh nahin kiya
 Earlier, Kejriwal himself has also accused PM Modi and other rival leaders without any proof

 He asked why he is not worried about his son's marriage? Tej Pratap said if his son is impotent? Tej Pratap said that he is under his parents right now and their parents are worried about their marriage, why is Sushil Kumar Modi worried

 Rebel MLA Kapil Mishra of Aam Aadmi Party also arrived on the occasion
 unhone vahaan kejariwal par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 From the platform of public support, India Against Corruption, Kapil Mishra said, "so far more than 15 firs have been filed against corruption of Kejriwal government
 ab bhi jaraa bhi naitikta nahin dikh rahi he
 Kejriwal broke the record of Lalu Yadav in the corruption case
 "kapil mishrane kaha, "pichley dinon chalaae gaye miss kaal abhiyaan main 1 lakh 25 hajaar log jude the
 Now this support has to be taken to the streets
 kejariwal ke bhrashtachar ke parche dilli bhar main baantenge or dilli ke har ilaake main padayatra nikaalenge
 "on being described as an agent of BJP, Kapil lashed out at Kejriwal and said that someday Kejriwal should not tell his wife Sunita Kejriwal also an agent of BJP
 kapil ne kejariwal ko bataaya dakukapil mishra yaheen nahi ruke unhone arvind kejariwal ko daaku kharag singh tak kah daalaa
 He said, Kejriwal's New Delhi seat will recall India Against Corruption Right to Recall
 rhite tu ricol ke liye july ke pehle hafte main hoga janamat sangharsh
 Finally, Kapil Mishra challenged the Kejriwal government and said that show a single case of corruption against me

 During this time it was also decided that Kapil Mishra would start the Jan Jagran Yatra against the Kejriwal government from the first week of July

 In this incident, instead of being taken to the medical center for better treatment, a patient was thrown into the drain by the police

 During this time the rain water kept falling on his body
 isaki vajah se marij na keval nimonia kaa shikaar ban gaya, balki uske sharir par gahare jakhm bhi ho gaye
 The police has kept silence on this entire matter

 From there MGM Medical College was referred for better treatment

 The villagers opened it after seeing the movement inside a plastic near the drain, and were surprised to see a man wrapped in a blanket
 uske sharir main harakat ho rahi thi
 Seeing him suffering from pain and fever, the local police was informed about it
 iske baad police ne ambulance mangava kar use aspataal pahunchaaya
 The patient is currently being treated at MGM Hospital, where he is suffering from a serious condition

 Past and present have often collided in Pakistan
 pakistan kii sthapana ke 70wein varsh main general jiyaul haq ke haathon takhtapalat kii 40veen varshganth or laal masjid ke gheraav tathaa us par dhaava bolne kii 10veen varshganth bhi he
 The shadow of these influential events is preventing Pakistan from creating new history
 jab supreme court ne 28 july ko navaj sharif ko wajire-ajam ke liye aayogy ghoshit kar diya, to pakistan main bahut se logon ko aisa laga ki kuch had tak kahin ve koi puraani tasviir to nahin dekh rahe
 The court considered that wazir-azam had a conflict with those articles of the constitution that expect the public representatives to be 'sadiq' (truthful) and 'amin' (virtuous)
 ye praavdhaan general jiya ne hi kiye the, kyonki ve pakistan ke samvidhan ko apni islamic dharmikata ke hisaab se bananaa chaahate the
 In an attempt to garner support for his removal, Sharif himself cited similarities like the Maulvi Tamizuddin case of 1955
 haalanki baad main supreme court ne 'rajya kii aavashyaktaa ke siddhant' kaa istemaal kiya tha or usne samvidhan sabha ko bhang karne kii ek yachika ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Thus, the year 2017 order to remove wazir-azam will inevitably have to be seen in the broader perspective of the history of Pakistan's 1950s, 1980s, 1990s, when court intervention suspended parliamentary authority
 haalanki, kai iske vipareet tark dete hai‚Äîpakistan main gaharaai tak jad jamaa chukaa bhrashtachar tabhi saaf kiya ja saktaa he, jab bilkul sheersh str par jhaadu lagaai jaae
 The role of Pakistan's military is certainly central among these competing officers and slogans: Sharif's entire period can only be seen as a civil-military confrontation
 unke hatane par agar fouj ke saath pakistan ke jatil itihaas kii yaad taaja ho gai, to hakeekat yah bhi he ki pakistan ne ek bada mauka ganvaa diya he
 If Sharif had completed his term, it would have been the first time in the history of Pakistan
 aatanki hamale niyamit rup se puure saal pakistan ke rajnatik ghatnakram main aadchan paidaa karte rahe hai
 Although the incidence and intensity of the terror attacks has decreased overall since 2015, but their persistence suggests that there is a renewed mobilization of well-to-do deposits and their masters, contrary to the Pakistani army's claim
 aise zyaadaatar hamalon main lakshya bhi anumaan ke mutabik hi hote hai: shiya, police or fouj or aasaan nishaanaa maani jane vaali avam
 However, even Sunni Muslims could not escape this: the attack on Lal Shahbaz Kalandar's Sufi Mazar in Sindh was part of a series that included the 2005 Imam Mazar of Islamabad and the 2010 attack on the donor court in Lahore
 yah tamaam aatanki samoohon kii lokapriy islamic kendron se lekar dharmaparayan barelvi tak se gahari shatruta ko bhi darshata hai
 However, Barelvi is not in the news only because he is subjected to repeated terrorist attacks
 november maheene main islamabad main ek dharne ne sadak par unki takat ko pradarshit kiya
 He reduced the life of the capital to Dharmabarmar and forced the government to negotiate and finally surrender
 iskaa netritv 'taharik-e-labbac yaa rasul allaah' ne kiya tha
 This organization is drawn from the staunch followers of Mumtaz Qadri, who murdered Punjab Governor Salman Taseer in 2011
 sankhya ke lihaaj se pakistan main barelvi kaaphi majboot hai, lekin unka itnaa rajnatik asar nahin he, jitna wahabiyon, devbandiyon or ahal-e-haddees jaisi jamaaton kaa
 All these groups have enjoyed military patronage since the time of the Afghan jihad of 1980 and after that they have strengthened their position by participating in cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir
 ho saktaa he ki barelvi ab lagaataar apane ko haashie par jate or takat kam hote mahasoos kar rahe hon
 In such a situation, by recently showing his strength on the road, he has declared his threat in the larger political scenario
 mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti main islamic tatwon ke ekadhikaar‚Äîjo pehle jamaat-e-islamic or jamiyat ulema-e-pakistan ke paas the‚Äîko ab barelvi chunauti denge
 Inevitably, the rise of this new political force has raised questions on the role of the Pakistani army
 sambhav he ki vahaan kisi aise chanakya kii bhoomika ho jiskaa lakshya agle chunaav tak sharif or unki party ko zyada se zyada kamjor karnaa ho
 However, due to the way in which the terrorist violence of Wahhabi or Deobandi organizations continues in Pakistan, due to this the power establishment of Pakistan itself has started considering their option and the rise of Barelwis can be seen in this context
 kisi bhi suurate-haal main barelvi kaa ubharna 2017 main pakistan ke itihaas ko milane vaali dirghakaalik vasiyat ho sakati he
 It is also necessary to recall a non-political incident of 2017, which may have wide implications
 pakistan is saal main phir se janaganana ke itihaas main shaamil hua he or kareeb do dashak ke baad desh bhar main janaganana hui he
 This is an important administrative and political achievement given the deterioration in the internal security situation of Pakistan during 2007‚Äì2015
 haalanki janaganana kaa nateeja ascharyajanak rahaa
 Between 1998 and 2017, the population averaged 2 annually
 4 fisadi kii badhat hui
 In short, measures to curb population growth have been very effective
 haalanki 20
 The huge population of 7 crores has strong implications for this country and the entire region
 pakistan ab duniya kaa paanchvaan bada desh he, lekin arthvyavastha ke lihaaj se yah duniya kaa 40waan bada desh hi he
 Historically, this comparison gives quite interesting results
 1971 main tatkaaleen purvi pakistan kii jansankhya pashchimi pakistan se zyada thi
 Today, Bangladesh's population is 3 crore less than Pakistan
 pakistan kaa bahari vaataavaran pratikul hi he, bharat or afghanistan ke saath uske rishton main uthal-puthal jagajaahir he
 The tussle between Saudi Arabia and Iran and between the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council is creating another uncertainty
 lekin sabase naatakeey badlaav to america ke saath pakistan ke rishton main aayaa he
 During President Donald Trump's tenure, the US has strictly rejected and increased pressure on Pakistan's Afghan and India policies and the protection given to it by terrorist organizations
 raashtrapati ne 2018 ke apane pehle twit se na keval 2017 kaa saar pesh kiya, balki yah khaakaa bhi pesh kiya ki aage kya hone ja rahaa he
 In 2017, Pakistan's response was to make at least half of the American expectation in Afghanistan with silent diplomatic efforts in public
 lekin america raashtrapati ke naveenatam akshep se to aisa lagata he ki yah ravaiya bhi kargar nahin hua
 On the other hand, the domestic pressure to adopt defiance against America cannot be ignored
 2017 nishchit rup se aisa saal tha, jab pakistan ne kareeb dedh dashak ke baad sabase zyada dabaav mahasoos kiya, lekin 2011 kii ghatnaon ko yaad karnaa mahatvapurn he‚Äîpakistan-america sambandhon main ek or bhayaavah varsh‚Äîjab remand davis kaa prakaran hua, osama bin laden ko maaraa gaya or nato ke hamale main 20 pakistani faujee maare gaye
 In response, Pakistan kept NATO supply routes in Afghanistan closed for a long time
 isse yah baat rekhaankit ho gai ki aise desh se nipatna kitna mushkil he, jisaki jansankhya 20 karod he, jo newclear power he or jisaki bhugolic sthiti aisi he ki use alag-thalag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 US pressure is increasing and proving to be overwhelming, after which Pakistan can join the ranks of Russia and China to protect themselves and play their cards accordingly
 haalanki uski gharelu paristhitiyaan bhi na sirf bharat or america balki china ke saath bahari rishte ko prabhavit karengi
 It is reasonable to assume that 2018 will be the year of examination for the china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)
 yah hakeekat he ki pakistani fouj se mil sakane vaale sahyog ke baavjood, aise bade project ko lagu karne main sthir siyaasi maahaul kii jarurat hoti he
 Most people in Pakistan are presuming that America and India are now working together
 kashmir kendrit aatanki sanghathan hijbul mujahidin ko agast 2017 main vaishvik aatanki sanghathan ghoshit karne ke baad is tarah kii dharna or majboot hui he
 Pakistan's relations with India have also cooled, it has declined further due to regular clashes along the Line of Control, reduction in the number of visas and poisonous rhetoric
 2008 ke mumbai aatanki hamalon kii varshganth se kuch dinon pehle hi jamaat-ud-daawa (jeyudi) pramukh hafiz said kii rihaai is baat kaa pratik thi ki bharat ke saath uske rishton kii duvidha hal nahin ho pai he
 All this is a familiar pattern repeated over and over, but as in the relations between India and Pakistan, there is always something new in it
 pakistan kii jail main aatankwaad ke aarope main band kiye gaye kulbhushan jadhav ko sainya adaalat ne maut kii sajaa sunai
 After that, India's arrival in the international court is a similar development
 zyaadaatar pakistaniyon ke liye jadhav cese kaa mahatv is myne main he ki isse pakistan bhi usee tarah se bharat par aatankwaad ko shah dene kaa aarope laga paaya he, jis tarah se bharat ab tak paak par lagaataa rahaa he
 The debate in both India and Pakistan on this issue is around the fact that India has been moving away from the bilateral relationship that it has been trying to bind for decades
 bharat aaj duniya se sampark rakhane ke maamle main kis tarah kaa aatmavishvaas dikhaa rahaa he, jabaki pakistan ke ravaie se lagata he ki vah andeh or band maansikta kaa shikaar he
 The year ended with worrying Pakistan completing 70 years
 aam chunaav kareeb he, lekin civil-military kaa pech ulajhaa hi he
 Political killings have not spared any mainstream political party or leader
 unki ghatati vishwasaneeyata ne vibhinn jamaat ke islamic sanghathanon‚Äîdevbandi, barelvi or kai tarah ke charampanthi sanghathanon jaise jeyudi aadi ko zyada jagah muhaiyaa karai he ki ve khud ko mukhyadhara main sthapit kar saken
 The election will take place in an atmosphere when the army of Pakistan is returning to the center of politics
 gharelu morche par javabdehi banaam naagarik sarvocchata ek duusare se takaraaengi, jise kramshah imran khan or sharif parivaar ne prachlit kiya he
 Despite all this, the elections in mid-2018 are important because the structure that will be created will reveal what things can take shape for India ahead
 bharat ke liye 2018 nepal main hue 2017 ke chunaav or 2019 main uske apane aam chunaav ke bich kaa saal he
 This year there will be elections in Pakistan, Bhutan and possibly Maldives
 bangladesh main janvari 2019 main or afghanistan main bhi sansadeey chunaav honge
 All these countries have their own issues and challenges
 ye sabhi desh ham par najar rakhenge or us ibaarat ko padhgaye kii koshish karenge jis par ham chal rahe hai
 The options for India, especially with Pakistan, will remain difficult and they will have to choose from many bad choices
 lekin may 2014 ko yaad karnaa upyogi hoga, jab kai tarah ke chunavi badlaavon ne raashtrapati bhawan ke praangan main nai sarkaar ke shapathgrahan ke samay dakshin asia kii ekajutata ko pradarshit kiya tha
 Returning to history is certainly not an option
 lekin kisi nai ibaarat ko likhane kii koshish main peeche mud ke dekhne main koi buraai nahin he
 In any case, the 'confidential' meeting of the national security advisors of the two countries in Bangkok at the end of 2017 underscores that you can temporarily keep aside the old writings of South Asia, but forever Can not be buried

 Shahid Afridi's stunning return to international cricket saw Pakistan beat the West Indies by 126 runs in the first one-day international, taking a 1-0 lead in the series
 champions trophy ke dauraan pakistani team se baahar rakhe gaye shahid aafridi ne pakistan ke liye na sirf van-de cricket main sarvshereshth gendbaaji kaa record banaaya, or sirf 12 ran dekar saat wicket chatkaaye, balki sirf 55 gendon main paanch gaganabhedi chhakkon or chah chaukon kii madad se 76 ran bhi thoke
 The comments 'main of da match' ghoshit kiye gaye aafridi kii tejatarraar ballebaaji, captain misbah ul-haq ke ardhshtak, or in donon khilaadiyon ke bich chathe wicket ke liye hui 120 ranon kii saajhedaari kii badaulat pakistan ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue nau wicket ke nuksaan par 224 ran banaae the, jiske jawaab main aafridi ke kamaal ke chalate west indies kii puri team 41 overon main kul 98 ranon par simat gai
 Shahid Afridi returned to the pavilion during his batting in the 39th over of the innings, caught by Kieron Pollard for deep midwicket to Darren Sammy
 udhar, west indies kii pari main pollard yaa kris gail koi kamaal nahin dikhaa sake
 Mohammed Irfan initially dismissed Johnson Charles and Darren Bravo cheaply, and Chris Gayle was unfortunate run out
 bas, iske baad aafridi ne carabian pari ko bikherkar rakh diya
 Shahid Afridi, who was left out of the Pakistani team during the Champions Trophy, not only set the record for the best bowling in one-day cricket for Pakistan, and took seven wickets for just 12 runs, but also five five-ball sixes and six fours in just 55 balls
 The 76ers also chipped in with help
 tippaniyan Afridi's fiery batting, declared captain Manbah ul-haq's half-century, and a 120-run partnership for the sixth wicket between these two players, was declared 'man of the match', with Pakistan batting first on a nine-wicket loss
 In response to 224 runs scored, Afridi's entire West Indies team was reduced to a total of 98 runs in 41 overs
 shahid aafridi apni ballebaaji ke dauraan pari ke 39wein over main kiron pollard kii gend par deep midwicket main darren saimi ko kaich dekar pavilion laute che
 On the other hand, Pollard or Chris Gayle could not do any good in the innings of the West Indies
 shuru main hi mohammad irfan ne johnson charles or darren braavo ko saste main out kar diya, or kris gail durbhagyapurna dhang se ran out ho gaye
 Just then, Afridi scattered the Caribbean innings

 police haniprit tak pahunchane ke liye ab deraa sachcha sauda kii managing cameti kii cheirperson vipasana insa ko jariya bananaa chaahati he
 Whatever the royalty of Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who is serving a 20-year sentence in Rohtak Jail, is now closely watched by the police
 bataa den ki vipasana insaan or haniprit insaa ke bich chhattis kaa aankada mana jaataa rahaa he
 On one hand, jahannipreet had declared himself to be the real heir of Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 vahiin gurmeet ke jail jane ke baad se vipasana kahati aa rahi he ki haniprit kaa deraa sachcha sauda se koi lenaa dena nahin he or naa hi uski koi hissedari he
 It is clear that there is a dispute over the ownership of the dera
 khud vipasana bhi nahin chaahati ki haniprit kaa ab dere main koi dakhal ho
 Amidst this tussle, finding Honeypreet remains a major headache for the police
 luk out notice jari karne ke baavjood bhi police haniprit kaa koi suraag nahin laga pai he
 Haryana Police, which is facing many criticisms about Dera Sacha Sauda, now wants to make Vipassana a human shield and reach Honeypreet's hideout
 sutron kaa kahana he ki haryana police ne vipasana sahit deraa management cameti ke 45 sadasyon kii suchi talab kii he
 The records of the people involved are being investigated
 vipasana bhi police kii jaanch ke daayre main he lekin police uskaa istemaal karke haniprit tak pahunchnaa chaahati he
 The administration believes that Vipassana is not only playing the role of a point person after the Insa Dera chief goes to jail but he has also kept the Dera followers under control
 saath hi prashasan ko puraa sahyog diya he
 Through Vipassana, the police want to capture not only Honeypreet but also other royalty of Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 isamen deraa ke think tanks main shaamil rahe doctor aditya insaan kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 After Gurmeet goes to jail, even Aditya Insan is not aware of the police

 There she stayed for an hour at the house of a follower of the camp
 uski car aakhri baar hisar road par jaati dekhi gai thi
 Since then, the police have not been able to even find any information of Honeypreet
 police par sarkaar kaa dabaav he ki wo jaldi se jaldi deshadroh ke maamle main vaanchit haniprit or aditya insaan ko pakad kar court me pesh kare
 However, it remains to be seen how long the Haryana Police can solve the mystery of missing Honeypreet

 Even though the Doklam dispute between India and China has now been resolved, the two countries are leaving it behind and talking about working together to further their relationship
 haalanki ab ek kitaab main bataaya gaya he china yahaan aar-paar kii ladaai ke liye pehle se taiyaar tha or yahaan usne doklam main ek maheene hi baari sankhya main apane sainik tainaat kar rakhe the
 In Nitin Gokhale's book 'securing India the Modi Way: Pathankot, Surgical Strike and More', China said that 12 thousand soldiers, 150 tanks and artillery guns in Fari Jong area near Sikchi's Chumbi Valley, about 1 month before the start of Doklam dispute

 After this, Indian troops also increased the deployment of troops
 kitaab main bataaya gaya ki jahaan donon deshon ke sainik aamane-saamne the vahaan chini mike or portable laudspikar lagaakar baar-baar 1962 ke yuddh ke sabak kii baat doharaa rahe the
 The Chinese had also started temporary construction of stone and clay to defend themselves

 However, the skirmish ended soon after which the soldiers of both the countries returned to their respective posts
 kitaab ke mutabik, 5 june ko donon deshon ke bich duusari jhadap ko hui, jab chini gashti dal parking aria main ja pahunchaa
 Here they started forcibly removing the Bhutanese soldiers and threatening them

 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party are playing the China card to win the Lok Sabha elections
 yahi nahin, pakistan ke saath vivaad badhanaa bhi modi kii lokapriyata badhaane or voters ko lubhaane kaa bijepi kaa ek daanv he
 China's state-run Global Times has made this serious allegation
 akhbaar main likhe ek aalekh main kaha gaya he, '11 april se 19 may tak hone vaale bhartiya chunaavon se kuch samay pehle hi bharat-pakistan main adaavat charam par pahunch gai jab farvari main bhartiya ardhsainik balon par fidaayin hamale ke baad bharat ne air strike kiye
 India had recently proposed to blacklist Pakistan-based extremist organization jaish-e-mohammed as a Global Terrorist in the Security Council
 isse aisa lagata he ki bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra modi or unki bhartiya janata party pakistan ke saath vivaad kaa istemaal apane ek mukhya chunavi daanv ke rup main karnaa chaahati he taaki modi kii lokapriyata bade or matadaataaon ko lubhaaya ja sake
 'the newspaper has said that before this, usually bilateral relations are not made an electoral issue in India or any other country, unless a war-like situation has arisen
 lekh main kaha gaya he, 'nishchit rup se china or bharat ke bich rishton main kuch samasyaayein hai, lekin yah kisi sankat kii ore badhane jaisaa nahin he
 Despite this, Modi has started using 'china Card' to divert attention from electoral issues
 akhbaar main kaha gaya he ki bijepi pehle chunaav jeetne ko lekar aashwast thi, lekin rojgaar main kam badhat jaise tamaam gharelu samasyaon kii vajah se isko aalochana kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Many BJP promises have not been fulfilled, due to which there is discontent among the people
 aise main modi jaise anbhavi raajnneetijna nishchit rup se 'china card' jaise tamaam card ke istemaal se chuknaa nahin chaahate
 This card goes on especially in northern India, the main fronts of so-called confrontations with China
 'ghat rahi he modi kii lokapriyata!akhbaar ne kaha ki modi kii lokapriyata main giravat aa rahi he, isliye vah vot hasil karne ke liye koi bhi mauka nahin chhodana chaahate
 Therefore, with the use of China Card, Modi is also increasing the confrontation with Pakistan
 bijepi ek nirdhaarit lakshya ke saath rashtravaadi bhaawanaaon ko jagaa rahi he or apane kattar chhavi ko majboot kar rahi he
 Many Indians feel that China has favored Islamabad in a confrontation with Pakistan, so this is a good chance for Modi to play the 'china Card'
 akhbaar ne kaha ki is saal bharat kaa aam chunaav kaaphi jatil he or yah kahana mushkil he ki koun jitegaa
 The newspaper said that India's general election this year is quite complex and it is difficult to say who will win
 gauratlab he ki beete 14 farvari ko pulavama main siarpief camp par aatanki hamale ke 11 din baad bharat ne pakistan ko karaara jawaab diya he

 sawaal number 1- kautilya ke arthshaastra main GST ke swaroop par niabandh likhie
 Question No
 2- Manu is the first Indian thinker of globalization
 charchaa kiijie
 These questions numbered 15-15 have been asked in the Political Science paper of MA (master of Arts) of Banaras Hindu University (BHU)
 haalanki chaatro kaa kahana he ki 'pracheen or madhyakaalin bharat main saamaajik or raajnneetik vichaar' ke tahat ye topics unke course kaa hissaa nahin hai
 Professor Kaushal Kishore Mishra, who prepared the paper, said, 'we considered it and found the philosophy of both thinkers to be taught to students through new examples like GST and globalization
 'unhone kaha, 'yah meraa vichaar tha ki chaatro ko in udaahranon se parichit karaayaa jaae
 What if it is not in the book? Isn't it our responsibility to find new ways of teaching? 'maamle par pratikriya dete hue ek chaatr ne kaha, 'sar ne hamen prashn kaa jawaab likhvaya tha or kaha tha ki ye sawaal paper main nishchit taur par aaenge
 These topics are not part of our textbook, but we took notes
 'lekinbiechayuse jude collejon ke chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen in sawaalon ke jawaab nahin padhaaye gaye hai or ye unke course kaa hissaa bhi nahin he
 According to Prof
 Mishra, 'arthashastra of GST in Kautitya's Arthashastra' Arthashastra of Kautilya (chanakya) is the first Indian book to indicate the present form of GST
 jiesti kaa praathmik concept he ki upabhokta ko zyada se zyada laabh milanaa chahie
 GST means that the country's economy and financial system should be uniform and integrated
 kautilya pehle vichaarak the jinhone raashtra kii arthvyavastha ko ekikrut banane kaa vichaar diya
 It is known that Kautilya is also known as Chanakya
 unhone kaha, 'vastav main kautilya ne hi apane samay main vichaar diya tha ki gharon kii nirmaan saamagree par tex kii dar 20 pratishat, sone or anya dhaatuon par 20 pratishat, seemaa shulk 20 pratishat, bagichon par 5 pratishat, nrity or kalakaaron par 50 pratishat tex hona chahie
 Mishra has told his students that Manu was the first thinker who introduced the world to the tradition of globalization
 unhone kaha, 'nitshe ne is bare main khub likhaa he or manu kii aarthik, raajnneetik or dharmik siddhanton kii tarif kii he
 Manu's ideas spread around the world and many countries adopted it
 dharm, bhashaa or raajnneeti par manu ke vichaaron ke saboot china, philipino, newjiland main mili hai
 They say that the word 'human' in New Zealand is derived from Manu
 'RSS ke sadsy hai professor mishraprofessor mishra biechayu main soshal science kii faikalti ke tahat bhartiya raajnneetik vyavastha or bhartiya raajnneetik vichaar padhaate hai
 Mishra acknowledged that he is a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, but also said that this is a private opinion and has nothing to do with what he teaches to the students
 vibhaag ke pramukh arapy singh ne is baat ko khaarij kar diya ki puche gaye sawaal silebus ke baahar ke the
 He said that any teacher sets questions in the paper related to his area of expertise
 koi bhi teacher apni visheshgyata or jo padhaata he usase baahar ke sawaal nahin poochta
 The question is not who is with Sushma Swaraj and who is in opposition
 yah bhi mul sawaal se bhatakaane vaala he ki modi cabinet kaa koi mantri sushamaa swaraj fiks kar rahaa he
 From the solidarity with which the RSS, BJP and Modi government have defended Sushma Swaraj, it does not seem that this news was leaked because they had not been getting a chance to rescue Sushma Swaraj for a long time
 yah khabar to landan ke akhbaaron main pichley hafte se chap rahi thi
 Sushma Swaraj also stole a tweet on Times Now journalist Navika Kumar to see who is talking about transparency
 sushamaa swaraj ne landan ke akhbaar da sande times or daily mail ke patrakaron ko chalange nahin kiya he
 There has been considerable political pressure on this issue, but due to which there is tension
 unhen aap dekhenge to lagegaa ki iees topper hon
 Who is who in Lalit Modi's feelings is meaningless
 lalit modi un bhagodon kii tarah nahin he, jo jonpur se bhagkar jhaansi main chhip gaye or pahari ke peeche encounter ho gaya
 According to his lawyer, Modi is not a fugitive
 kisi court ne bhagoda ghoshit nahin kiya he
 Journalists from the Italian city of Venice told that they are keeping an eye on the news
 aarope he ki lalit modi ko patni ke oparation ke liye portugal janaa tha, taaki ve oparation ke liye sahmati patr par dastakhat kar saken
 Lalit Modi's passport in India was canceled, so he was living as a refugee
 tasveeron se to lagata he ki ye duniya ke sabase glamras sharnaarthi hai
 His passport was reinstated by the Delhi High Court on 27 August
 isliye kahana mushkil he ki lalit modi ne sushamaa swaraj kii badaulat se mili dastavejon ke sahare thailand, dubai, hawana, spain, venice or ibiza jaise shaharon kii yatra kii
 On August 4, 2014, Lalit also tweeted from Portugal that just spend a day at champali maude center for unknown
 yah portugal ke aspataal kaa naam he
 News of his cancer has been published in London newspapers
 ipel cricket ke kamishnar ke taur par kareeb saat sau karod rupee ke gaban kaa aarope he
 The Enforcement Directorate of India has issued a blue corner notice
 interpol ke zarie blue carnor notice jari kiya jaataa he taaki pataa rahe ki amuk vyakti kahaan hai
 Modi's lawyer says the blue corner notice has not been issued
 saal 2013 main upie ke vitt mantri ke taur par pi chidambaram ne british sarkaar se kaha tha ki vah lalit modi ke kilaaf karrwai kare or bharat ko saunp de
 It is obvious that UPA made a report in the case of Lalit Modi
 lekin sawaal yah he ki endie ke samay khanaapurti kyon ho rahi he
 Why the Modi government could not bring Lalit Modi to India in a year? Will Sushma Swaraj tell what efforts were made
 27 agast 2014 main dilli hoicourt ne lalit modi kaa passport behaal kiya, tab videsh mantralay ne supreme court main chunauti bhi nahin di
 The case should be looked at in the UK where Conservative Party MP Andrew Bridgen has written to the Parliament's Standards Commissioner to investigate whether Labor party member Keith Vaz violated the mps' code of conduct to help someone Yes or No
 daily mail ke anusaar pichley june main kith vaaz ne imigration ke mahanideshak ko oficial letters pad par likhaa tha ki lalit modi ko ek shaadi main shariq hone ke liye or apni biimaar patni ke saath jane ke liye travel dacument chahie
 Lalit Modi got British travel documents within 24 hours thanks to this letter from Indian-origin MP Keith Vaz
 landan ke akhbaaron main ek email kaa bhi zikr ho rahaa he ki sushamaa swaraj ke pati swaraj kaushal ne lalit modi se apane bhattije ke admician ke liye madad maangi thi
 Lalit Modi had also emailed Keith Vaz regarding this
 admician ho chukaa he
 Now the question is whether the admission was done on humanitarian basis or was part of any transaction
 sushamaa swaraj press conference nahin kar rahi hai
 Is tweeting
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki twitor par madad maangane par ve aam logon kii bhi madad karti hai, turant ection leti hai, lekin yahaan madad kaa aarope ek aise vyakti kii madad kaa he jo bharat aakar kanoon kii madad nahin kar rahaa he
 Sushma Swaraj said that Lalit Modi had to sign a consent letter for his wife's operation, so helped on humanitarian grounds, but according to the European Union, at the time of the operation, the patients themselves can give written consent for their operation
 gavaah kii zarurat tab padati he, jab mariz bolne yaa likhane main asamarth ho
 Portugal is a member of the European Union
 portugal ke apane ke kanoon ke anusaar mariz kisi bhi tareeke se apane oparation kii sahmati de saktaa he
 So what was the excuse for consent? Can a person against whom a Blue Corner notice be so easily contacted by the Foreign Minister of India
 ravivaar ko sushamaa swaraj ne twit kar safai di july 2014 main lalit modi ne mujhe bataaya ki unki patni kaa chaar agast ko portugal main cancer kaa oparation hona he
 They have to be there to sign the consent form
 unhone yatra dastauez jari karaane main madad maangi
 i asked the British High Commissioner on humanitarian grounds to consider the British government on the basis of its law in this matter
 agar britain unhen yatra dastauez jari karata he to isse donon deshon ke rishte kharaab nahin honge
 Vaz also spoke to me
 maine unase bhi vahiin baat kahi, jo british ucchayukta se kahi thi
 The consent letter does not have to be signed
 sawaal yah bhi he ki madad karte vakt kya sushamaa swaraj ne bhartiya duutavas ko jaankaree di
 Did you say to Lalit Modi that you have to surrender in return? What is the role of the Enforcement Directorate after the controversy unfolds? Did Sushma Swaraj inform the Enforcement Directorate that Lalit Modi has been helped on humanitarian grounds? diene akhbaar ne 7 may 2014 ko jab lalit modi se poocha ki aap bharat kab waapas aane vaale hai, tab unhone kaha tha ki do hafte rah gaye hai
 Let us talk about the election results
 ise kehete hai confidence
 The comments is bich shaam hote-hote prakaash jaavdekar kii ek press conference hui
 He said that the pictures of Congress Lalit Modi, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are showing in 2010
 2015 main dikhaane kaa kya tuk he
 There are hundreds of photographs of Rajiv Shukla and Jyotiraditya Scindia
 kyon puraani tasviren dikhain ja rahi hai
 There are pictures of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi with coal and 2G scam accused
 prakaash jaavdekar do sawaal puch kar chale gaye ki lalit modi ko kiski sarkaar ne landan jane diya
 Where did the Congress leaders go on holiday? har sawaal ke saamne ek sawaal khadaa kiya ja rahaa he
 Can BJP and Modi government avoid these questions by removing old cases
 jail main band kaidi kaa maanviya aadhaar hota he use parol par reeha kiya jaataa rahaa he, aaropee adaalat kii ijaajat se videsh jate rahe hai
 Prime time sushamaa swaraj ne times nau kii patrkaar navika kumaar par hi ek twit daag diya ki dekho shuchita yani proparity kii baat koun kar rahaa he
 Sushma Swaraj has not challenged the journalists of the London newspaper The Sunday Times and Daily Mail
 is mudde ko lekar acha khaasaa raajnneetik dabaav paidaa ho gaya he, lekin jisaki vajah se tanaav he
 If you see them, then you will feel that IAS is a topper
 lalit modi kii sohabaton main koun-koun he ye baat bemaani he
 Lalit Modi is not like those fugitives who escaped from Jaunpur, hid in Jhansi and got an encounter behind the hill
 vaise unke vakil ke mutabik modi bhagoda nahin hai
 No court has declared a fugitive
 italy ke shahar venice se patrakaron ko bataaya ki ve khabar par nazar rakh rahe hai
 It is alleged that Lalit Modi had to go to Portugal for his wife's operation, so that he could sign the mou for the operation
 bharat main lalit modi kaa passport radd kar diya gaya tha, isliye ve sharnaarthi kii tarah rah rahe the
 The photographs suggest that they are the most glamorous refugees in the world
 dilli hoicourt ne 27 agast ko unke passport ko behaal kar diya tha
 Therefore, it is difficult to say that Lalit Modi traveled to cities like Thailand, Dubai, Havana, Spain, Venice and Ibiza with the help of documents from Sushma Swaraj
 chaar agast 2014 ko lalit ne portugal se twit bhi kiya tha ki just spend a day at champali maude centre for unknown
 It is the name of a hospital in Portugal
 landan ke akhbaaron main unke cancer kii khabaren chhapati rahi hai
 As commissioner of IPL cricket, there are allegations of embezzlement of about seven hundred crores rupees
 bharat ke pravartan nideshaalay ne blue carnor notice jari kiya he
 Blue Corner notice is issued through Interpol to know where such persons are
 modi ke vakil kaa kahana he blue carnor notice jari nahin hua he
 In 2013, as finance minister of UPA, p Chidambaram had asked the British government to take action against Lalit Modi and hand it over to India
 zaahir he upie ne lalit modi ke maamle main khanaapurti kii
 But the question is why Khanapuri is happening at the time of NDA
 ek saal main modi sarkaar lalit modi ko bharat kyon nahin laa saki? kya sushamaa swaraj bataaengi ki kya-kya prayaas hue
 On 27 August 2014, Delhi High Court restored the passport of Lalit Modi, then the Ministry of External Affairs did not challenge in the Supreme Court
 is maamle ko britain kii nazar se dekha janaa chahie jahaan conservative party ke saansad andrew brijan ne sansad ke standard kamishnar ko likhaa he ki vah jaanch kare ki lebar party ke saasand kith vaaz ne kisi kii madad karne ke liye saansadon kii aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kiya he yaa nahin
 According to the Daily Mail, last June, Keith Vaz wrote to the Director General of Immigration on an official letter pad that Lalit Modi needed a travel document to attend a wedding and accompany his ailing wife
 bhartiya mul ke saansad kith vaaz kii is chitthee kii badaulat 24 ghante ke bheetar lalit modi ko british travel dastauez mil gaye
 An email is also mentioned in London newspapers that Swaraj Kaushal, husband of Sushma Swaraj, had sought help from Lalit Modi for the admission of his nephew
 lalit modi ne is babat kith vaaz ko bhi email kiya tha
 Admission has been done
 ab sawaal he ki admician bhi kya maanviya aadhaar par kiya gaya yaa kisi len dein kaa hissaa rahaa hoga
 Sushma Swaraj is not holding a press conference
 twit kar rahi hai
 There is no doubt that she also helps the common people by asking for help on Twitter, takes immediate action, but the charge of help here is of the help of a person who is not coming to India and helping the law
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki lalit modi ko patni ke oparation ke liye sahmati patr par sin karnaa tha, isliye maanviya aadhaar par madad kii lekin europea sangh ke anusaar oparation ke samay mariz khud apane oparation ke liye likhit sahmati de saktaa he
 a witness is required when the patient is unable to speak or write
 portugal europea sangh kaa sadsy he
 According to Portugal's own law, patients can consent to their operation in any way
 to kya sahmati kaa bahaanaa banaaya gaya? kya ek vyakti jiske khilaaf blue corner notice ho vah itani aasaani se bharat ke videsh mantri se sampark kar saktaa he
 On Sunday, Sushma Swaraj tweeted and clarified in July 2014, Lalit Modi told me that his wife is to have a cancer operation in Portugal on August 4
 sahmati patr par dastakht karne ke liye unka vahaan rahanaa zaruri he
 He asked for help in issuing travel documents
 maine maanviya aadhaar par british ucchayukta se kaha ki is maamle main british sarkaar apane kanoon ke aadhaar par vichaar kare
 If Britain issues travel documents to them, it will not spoil the relationship between the two countries
 vaaj ne bhi mujhase baat kii
 i said the same thing to him, who had said to the British High Commissioner
 sahmati patr par dastakhat ke liye hona zaruri nahin he
 The question is also whether Sushma Swaraj informed the Indian Embassy while helping
 kya lalit modi se kaha ki badale main aapako samparn karnaa hoga? pravartan nideshaalay kii is vivaad ke saamne aane ke baad kya bhoomika he? kya sushamaa swaraj ne pravartan nideshaalay ko soochna di ki lalit modi kii maanviya aadhaar par madad kii gai he? On 7 May 2014, when the DNA newspaper asked Lalit Modi when he was going to return to India, he said that two weeks were left
 chunaav ke nattejey aane do tab ham baat karte hai
 This is called confidence
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, in the evening, there was a press conference of Prakash Javadekar
 unhone kaha ki congress lalit modi narendra modi or amit shah kii jo tasviren dikhaa rahi hai, wo 2010 kii hai
 What is the point of showing in 2015 rajeev shukla or jyotiraditya sindhiya kii sainkadon tasviren hai
 Why old photos are being shown
 sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi kii koyala or 2 ji ghotaale ke aropiyon ke saath tasviren hai
 Prakash Javadekar left with two questions, whose government allowed Lalit Modi to go to London
 congress ke netaa kahaan chuttee manaane gaye the
 a question is being raised in front of every question
 kya puraane maamalon ko nikaal kar bijepi or modi sarkaar in sawaalon se batch sakati he
 The prison inmate has a humanitarian base, he has been released on parole, the accused has gone abroad with the permission of the court
 prime time Lalit Modi is not like those fugitives who escaped from Jaunpur, hid in Jhansi and got an encounter behind the hill
 vaise unke vakil ke mutabik modi bhagoda nahin hai
 No court has declared a fugitive

 Prakash Javadekar left with two questions, whose government allowed Lalit Modi to go to London
 congress ke netaa kahaan chuttee manaane gaye the
 a question is being raised in front of every question
 kya puraane maamalon ko nikaal kar bijepi or modi sarkaar in sawaalon se batch sakati he
 The prison inmate has a humanitarian base, he has been released on parole, the accused has gone abroad with the permission of the court
 prime time His passport was reinstated by the Delhi High Court on 27 August
 isliye kahana mushkil he ki lalit modi ne sushamaa swaraj kii badaulat se mili dastavejon ke sahare thailand, dubai, hawana, spain, venice or ibiza jaise shaharon kii yatra kii
 On August 4, 2014, Lalit also tweeted from Portugal that just spend a day at champali maude center for unknown
 yah portugal ke aspataal kaa naam he
 News of his cancer has been published in London newspapers
 ipel cricket ke kamishnar ke taur par kareeb saat sau karod rupee ke gaban kaa aarope he
 The Enforcement Directorate of India has issued a blue corner notice
 interpol ke zarie blue carnor notice jari kiya jaataa he taaki pataa rahe ki amuk vyakti kahaan hai
 Modi's lawyer says the blue corner notice has not been issued
 saal 2013 main upie ke vitt mantri ke taur par pi chidambaram ne british sarkaar se kaha tha ki vah lalit modi ke kilaaf karrwai kare or bharat ko saunp de
 It is obvious that UPA made a report in the case of Lalit Modi
 lekin sawaal yah he ki endie ke samay khanaapurti kyon ho rahi he
 Why the Modi government could not bring Lalit Modi to India in a year? Will Sushma Swaraj tell what efforts were made
 27 agast 2014 main dilli hoicourt ne lalit modi kaa passport behaal kiya, tab videsh mantralay ne supreme court main chunauti bhi nahin di
 The case should be looked at in the UK where Conservative Party MP Andrew Bridgen has written to the Parliament's Standards Commissioner to investigate whether Labor party member Keith Vaz violated the mps' code of conduct to help someone Yes or No
 daily mail ke anusaar pichley june main kith vaaz ne imigration ke mahanideshak ko oficial letters pad par likhaa tha ki lalit modi ko ek shaadi main shariq hone ke liye or apni biimaar patni ke saath jane ke liye travel dacument chahie
 Lalit Modi got British travel documents within 24 hours thanks to this letter from Indian-origin MP Keith Vaz
 landan ke akhbaaron main ek email kaa bhi zikr ho rahaa he ki sushamaa swaraj ke pati swaraj kaushal ne lalit modi se apane bhattije ke admician ke liye madad maangi thi
 Lalit Modi had also emailed Keith Vaz regarding this
 admician ho chukaa he
 Now the question is whether the admission was done on humanitarian basis or was part of any transaction
 sushamaa swaraj press conference nahin kar rahi hai
 Is tweeting
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki twitor par madad maangane par ve aam logon kii bhi madad karti hai, turant ection leti hai, lekin yahaan madad kaa aarope ek aise vyakti kii madad kaa he jo bharat aakar kanoon kii madad nahin kar rahaa he
 Sushma Swaraj said that Lalit Modi had to sign a consent letter for his wife's operation, so helped on humanitarian grounds, but according to the European Union, at the time of the operation, the patients themselves can give written consent for their operation
 gavaah kii zarurat tab padati he, jab mariz bolne yaa likhane main asamarth ho
 Portugal is a member of the European Union
 portugal ke apane ke kanoon ke anusaar mariz kisi bhi tareeke se apane oparation kii sahmati de saktaa he
 So what was the excuse for consent? Can a person against whom a Blue Corner notice be so easily contacted by the Foreign Minister of India
 ravivaar ko sushamaa swaraj ne twit kar safai di july 2014 main lalit modi ne mujhe bataaya ki unki patni kaa chaar agast ko portugal main cancer kaa oparation hona he
 They have to be there to sign the consent form
 unhone yatra dastauez jari karaane main madad maangi
 i asked the British High Commissioner on humanitarian grounds to consider the British government on the basis of its law in this matter
 agar britain unhen yatra dastauez jari karata he to isse donon deshon ke rishte kharaab nahin honge
 Vaz also spoke to me
 maine unase bhi vahiin baat kahi, jo british ucchayukta se kahi thi
 The consent letter does not have to be signed
 sawaal yah bhi he ki madad karte vakt kya sushamaa swaraj ne bhartiya duutavas ko jaankaree di
 Did you say to Lalit Modi that you have to surrender in return? What is the role of the Enforcement Directorate after the controversy unfolds? Did Sushma Swaraj inform the Enforcement Directorate that Lalit Modi has been helped on humanitarian grounds? diene akhbaar ne 7 may 2014 ko jab lalit modi se poocha ki aap bharat kab waapas aane vaale hai, tab unhone kaha tha ki do hafte rah gaye hai
 Let us talk about the election results

 Prime time daily mail ke anusaar pichley june main kith vaaz ne imigration ke mahanideshak ko oficial letters pad par likhaa tha ki lalit modi ko ek shaadi main shariq hone ke liye or apni biimaar patni ke saath jane ke liye travel dacument chahie
 Lalit Modi got British travel documents within 24 hours thanks to this letter from Indian-origin MP Keith Vaz
 landan ke akhbaaron main ek email kaa bhi zikr ho rahaa he ki sushamaa swaraj ke pati swaraj kaushal ne lalit modi se apane bhattije ke admician ke liye madad maangi thi
 Lalit Modi had also emailed Keith Vaz regarding this
 admician ho chukaa he
 Now the question is whether the admission was done on humanitarian basis or was part of any transaction
 sushamaa swaraj press conference nahin kar rahi hai
 Is tweeting
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki twitor par madad maangane par ve aam logon kii bhi madad karti hai, turant ection leti hai, lekin yahaan madad kaa aarope ek aise vyakti kii madad kaa he jo bharat aakar kanoon kii madad nahin kar rahaa he
 Sushma Swaraj said that Lalit Modi had to sign a consent letter for his wife's operation, so helped on humanitarian grounds, but according to the European Union, at the time of the operation, the patients themselves can give written consent for their operation
 gavaah kii zarurat tab padati he, jab mariz bolne yaa likhane main asamarth ho
 Portugal is a member of the European Union
 portugal ke apane ke kanoon ke anusaar mariz kisi bhi tareeke se apane oparation kii sahmati de saktaa he
 So what was the excuse for consent? Can a person against whom a Blue Corner notice be so easily contacted by the Foreign Minister of India
 ravivaar ko sushamaa swaraj ne twit kar safai di july 2014 main lalit modi ne mujhe bataaya ki unki patni kaa chaar agast ko portugal main cancer kaa oparation hona he
 They have to be there to sign the consent form
 unhone yatra dastauez jari karaane main madad maangi
 i asked the British High Commissioner on humanitarian grounds to consider the British government on the basis of its law in this matter
 agar britain unhen yatra dastauez jari karata he to isse donon deshon ke rishte kharaab nahin honge
 Vaz also spoke to me
 maine unase bhi vahiin baat kahi, jo british ucchayukta se kahi thi
 The consent letter does not have to be signed
 sawaal yah bhi he ki madad karte vakt kya sushamaa swaraj ne bhartiya duutavas ko jaankaree di
 Did you say to Lalit Modi that you have to surrender in return? What is the role of the Enforcement Directorate after the controversy unfolds? Did Sushma Swaraj inform the Enforcement Directorate that Lalit Modi has been helped on humanitarian grounds? diene akhbaar ne 7 may 2014 ko jab lalit modi se poocha ki aap bharat kab waapas aane vaale hai, tab unhone kaha tha ki do hafte rah gaye hai
 Let us talk about the election results
