 ' Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has clarified comments on people criticizing the Narendra Modi government at the Center for development
 arun jetali ne somvaar ko chhapi khabaron ko galat qaraar dete hue spashtikaran diya ki media ke ek dhade ne unke bayaan ko galat dhang se pesh kiya
 Arun Jaitley tweeted on Monday that a section of the media mis-published my speech at the passing out event of the 67th batch of Indian Revenue Service Officers (IRS)
 jetali ne kaha, 'maine aisi baat kahi hi nahin thi
 i had said, 'people have the right to demand development and their duty to pay taxes
 ' is tippanee ko galat dhang se pesh kiya
 With these tweets, the Finance Minister has shared his speech on the video
 My exact comment "people have a right to demand development & duty to pay taxes", has been misquoted
 (3 / 4) - Arun Jaitley (@arunjaitley) October 2, 2017 Earlier, news agency ANI reported that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in the program that people who want the development of the country will have to pay the price for it and this money is honest
 It is necessary to spend from darasal custom exise or narkotics ke sthapana diwas or bhartiya rajasav seva adhikariyon ke passing out kaarykram main bolte hue jetali ne kaha ki rajasav sarkaar ke liye lifline kii tarah he or yah bharat ko vikasshil se vikasijerthvyavasthabanane main madad karegaa
 The Finance Minister said that in a society where traditionally people do not consider tax to be a complaint, they are slowly realizing the importance of paying tax, which comes with time
 yah tex vyavastha ke ekikaran kaa ahm kaaran he
 Once the change is established
 hamaare paas sudhaar ke liye samay or spes rahegaa
 Once the economy becomes revenue neutral, we need to think of better reforms
 tex anupaalan par jor dete hue jetali ne kaha ki taxeshan main koi grey aria nahin he
 Tax officers need to be firm and honest so that those who are in the tax net pay
 or ve log jo tex ke daayre se baahar hai unhen iskaa boj na sahanaa pade
 He said, 'india was following indirect tax when the economy was growing
 diarect tex ek khaas varg detaa tha, jabaki indiarect tex kaa sab par boj tha
 That is why we try in our financial policies that basic products should be taxed at least
 ' According to the estimates of Udyog Mandal Assocham, the state's economy has suffered an immediate loss of Rs 5,400-5,700 crore due to heavy floods in Jammu and Kashmir
 is baadh ke kaaran vyapaar, hotel, restaraan, bagwani va hastshilp udyog ko baari nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Due to the most severe flood in a hundred years, basic amenities like electricity, railways and communication have suffered a lot in Jammu and Kashmir
 asocham ke anusaar rajya main hotel, vyapaar, krishi, sadak va pulon ko 2,630 karod rupee ke nuksaan kaa anumaan he
 In addition, high-cost infrastructure such as railways, electricity and communications are expected to suffer a loss of Rs 2,700-3,000 crore
 asocham ke mutabik baadh ke kaaran hue nuksaan ke bare main ye keval shuruaati anumaan hai
 Its real damage to the economy of Jammu and Kashmir can be quite high, because the impact of such a disaster is prolonged
 asocham ke mahasachiv dies ravat ne kaha ki sabase badi chintaa paryatakon kaa bharosa tootna he or paryatakon ko dobaaraa rajya main aakarshith karne main lanbaa samay va prayaas lagenge
 In this regard, he has given the example of Uttarakhand, which has not yet recovered from last year's unexpected floods
 ananyaa pandey apni pehali hi film student of di year 2 ke set par ghayal hote hote bachiin thi
 On a chat show, Ananya told that Tiger Shroff had come to save him but due to the seriousness of the situation, he decided to go back
 unhone ek intervyuu main baatcheet karte hue kaha ki main us dauraan ek gaadi main baithi thi
 Suddenly the airbags of that vehicle were opened
 tiger mujhe bachaane aae the lekin jab unhen ehsaas hua ki car main dhamaakaa ho saktaa he to ve mujhe chhodkar duusari disha main bhaag gaye
 They said that everyone had left me in that car
 maine kai horer stories main dekha he ki jab bhi jatke se airbags khulte hai to naak par chot lagati he
 So my first reaction was that my nose is safe? However later i realized how serious the situation could have been
 phir maine film dekhi or jab dekha ki film main ye seen hi nadaarad tha to main man hi man soch rahi thi ki is seen ke liye maine apni zindagi daanv par lagaai thi or is seen ko hi edit kar diya gaya

 espiji suraksha kaa tamzam to vaisaa hi tha, magar gadiyon ke kafile kii jagah 24 akbar road se bas par savaar hokar nikaleen sonia gandhi
 And together were his son and Congress's No
 2 leader Rahul Gandhi
 phir to sanghathan or sarkaar donon hi sonia or rahul ke peeche-peeche us surajkund ke liye nikal padi, jahaan samvaad kaa havankund sajaa
 The government and the organization vowed to melt their flaws and brighten the image on the heat of the dialogue
 mushkil se 18 maheene bache hai, jab janata manmohan singh kii sarkaar or sarkaar chalaane vaali congress se paanch saal kaa puraa hisaab maangegi
 For 8 years, Congress has been slogan- Congress's hand - with common man

 As Congress workers, we are all members of the same family
 hamamen se har ek kii apni jimmedaari he, vah chaahe sarkaar main mantri ke taur par hon, chaahe sanghathan main padaadhikari ke taur par

 Udayanraje Bhosle, the 13th descendant of Chhatrapati Shivajimaharaja who is an NCP party MP
 jab unase bhima koregaanv main hue dangon ke bare main baat kii gai to udayanraaje bhosle ne kaha ki in dangon se koi naa koi phayda to jarur uthayega
 Instead of talking about 200 years ago, we should focus on progress
 aaj logon ko sirf vot bank kii ore dhakela ja rahaa he
 Udayanraje said that i had spoken to the villagers over the phone
 gaanv main sab mil julkar rahete hai lekin aise achaanak se ye kaise ho gaya kisi ko kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 Now people have to understand how great people like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Chhatrapati Sambhajiamaharaj always took people of all castes along and they never made any discrimination
 isliye aaj kai saal ho jane ke baavjood log unki jayanti manaate hai
 People should learn from these great people how people are treated
 udayanraaje ne aage kaha ki aaj ke is yug main logon ko jaat paat bhula deni chahie
 In the same way, blood group is seen in case of accident and not of patient
 ab 200 saal pehle kya hua tha kya nahin is par charchaa karne se koi phayda nahin
 Jatiya is like colors, some saffron some blue and some green
 indradhanush main bhi saat rang hote hai or sabhi rang saath milakar rahete hai, hamen bhi vaise hi saath rahanaa chahie
 Always, people kept some Muslims with them for vote bank, and sometimes some people took Dalits with them
 lekin kabhi kisi ne ye nahin sochaa kii desh ke liye kya sahi he kya galat
 Today, what is most important are things like education, medical facilities, all these things have become non-issue and this violence has become a matter of discussion
 dosti karne se pehle ham ye kabhi nahin sochate ki koun kis jaat kaa he to phir hamen anya samay bhi nahin sochna chahie
 Caste is being given importance only for vote bank, which is wrong
 udayanraaje ne aage kaha ki pichley do dinon main kisaano kaa bahot nuksaan ho gaya he
 If there was a fight between the villagers and the cities, then the people of the city would not get food grains but would get the opportunity to import from outside
 udayanrajene yah bhi kaha ki meri tareef karne se kuch nahin hoga
 i do not care who belongs to which party
 agar koi galat he to vah galat he
 If someone has made a mistake, then action should also be taken
 mujhe ye investigation, jaanch samiti sab bakawaas lagati he
 Because nothing has come out of whatever investigation has taken place till date, it is like throwing dust in the eyes
 jisane bhi yah kiya he usapar karrwai honi chahie, us ek nirdosh kii jaan gai he jisaki umr kaaphi kam thi

 According to what i have felt, BJP is moving towards majority
 'sushamaa ne kaha ki basapa ke khilaaf chal rahi lahar kaa laabh bhaajapa ko mil rahaa he, kyonki bhaajapa janata kii pehali pasand he
 The reason for this is that the public has also seen the rule of SP and does not want to go to that side again
 gandhi parivaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki akhabaaron ke pehle panne par jagah banane ke liye ve hindi filmon kii tarj par chunaav prachaar kar rahe hai
 According to Sushma, 'I think the Gandhi family has tied up with a company for this, which suggests that if you do this today, tomorrow your photo will be on the front page of the newspaper
 isi ranneeti ke tahat rahul gandhi kabhi suchi faadte hai to kabhi priyanka manch par apni mummy ke saath hansi-majaak karti hai
 'sushma said,' BJP is fighting on the basis of election issues, while other parties are running away from it
 isliye janata bhaajapa ko apni pehali pasand maan rahi he
 ' akshay kumaar bollywood ke un sitaron main se hai jo apane dil kii baat kehane yaa kisi bhi achche kaam ko karne main kabhi peeche nahin rahete

 jammu-kashmir ke samba main hue aatanki hamale main nuksaan or bhi zyada ho saktaa tha, lekin ganimat he ki aisa kuch nahin hua
 Where the terrorists attacked, there is also an army school nearby and children start coming to school by 9 o'clock
 aise main andaja lagaaie agar aatankiyon ne yah hamalaa kuch ghante baad kiya hota to kya hota? So were the terrorists plotting to repeat the incident like Peshawar? This cannot even be ruled out completely
 haalanki isaki kalpana kar hi man kaanp uthta he or puure sharir main siharan si daud jaati he
 Last year, more than 150 people, mostly children, were killed in a terrorist attack at Army School in Peshawar, Pakistan
 haalanki peshawar main hui ghatana se sabak lekar sena ne pehle hi deshbhar main jitne bhi army skool hai vahaan par suraksha ke intjaam badha die hai
 If terrorists attack, how will they be protected from it and what should be done, training has been given to them from children to teachers, but what about the savage poor people who die? isse bhi badi baat yah bhi ki jammu-kashmir main sarkaar bane maheenaa bhi nahin gujara he ki yah doosraa aatanki hamalaa he vah bhi mahaj 24 ghante ke bheetar
 On Friday, militants attacked a civilian, including three policemen, at the Kathua police station, raising questions about peace
 isi jagah par kareeb dedh saal pehle do aatankiyon ne sena ke camp par hamalaa kiya tha
 An army major and a soldier were killed in that attack
 samba main hamalaa karne se pehle aatankiyon ne hiranagar thane par hamalaa kiya tha, jis dauraan kareeb 11 log maare gaye the
 At that time, the terrorists had crossed the international border and had succeeded to a great extent in their cause
 is dfa bhi aatankiyon ne samba par hamalaa karne se pehle kathua ke police stesan par hamalaa kiya
 It is also said that these terrorists are part of the same group who had crossed the international border on Friday
 ek group ne kathua par hamalaa kiya or doosraa samba army camp par
 These terrorists entered through the same path where there is a ban, BSF is 24 hours alert and claims that Parinda cannot be killed
 is dfa bhi in aatanki hamalon ne ek nahin kai nishane saadhe
 These attacks have shown that the hold of terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir has not weakened
 saath hi unhone pathankot- jammu rashtriya rajmarg par hamalaa kar rajya ke aarthik dhaanche par bhi chot pahuchai he, kyonki desh ke kisi bhi hisse se sadak maarg dwaara rajya main aade jane kaa bas yahi rasta he
 The question also arises here, why did the terrorists target the area of jammu only? Have they shifted their target from Kashmir to Jammu? Is the reason behind this that he wants to give a message to Delhi? The 25 seats BJP has won are all over Jammu region
 ye baat digar he ki riyasat ke mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said aatankiyon ko lekar naram ravaiya akhriyaar kiye hue hai or kya usee kaa nateeja he ki aatankiyon ke hausale bade hue hai? kal hi kutha main hue aatanki hamale ke baad mukhyamantri ne kaha ki is samasya kaa hal bandook se nahin ho saktaa he or iske liye baatcheet jaruri he
 But the question of lakhs is that with whom? Are the terrorists who attacked Fidine? If this can not happen, then who should we talk to? vaise mufti sahab kaa dawaab kahen yaa phir kuch or sarkaar ek baar phir se pakistan se baat kar rishte sudhaarney par jor de rahi he
 But has Pakistan broken its ties with terror? And can talking to him really be a new beginning? Or, as always, this initiative will also prove to be the first three stages of Dhaka

 When the new party manifesto of the Samajwadi Party Akhilesh Yadav released the party's manifesto on Sunday, two shortcomings were noticed
 pehali, manch par mulaayam singh yadav kii or duusari, menifesto main muslimon ke muddon kii
 Was it coincidental or was the sp's natural face with the Akhilesh era from the Mulayam era? Experts are considering this as the political bet of Akhilesh Yadav, whose success or failure is going to have a direct impact on the political future of Akhilesh
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main samaajawaadee party ne muslimon ko 18 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 This announcement was said to be the main reason behind the lump sum votes of the Muslims in the elections as Samajwadi Party got almost 45 percent of the Muslim votes in those elections
 aam chunaav 2014 ke chunavi ghoshnaa patr main bhi samaajawaadee party ne musalamaanon ko police or piesi main 15 pratishat aarakshan dene kaa vaayada kiya tha, haalanki 2014 ke chunaav main mulaayam ko muslim vot to mili lekin siten mahaj chaar milin
 Lessons learned from the 2014 debacle: After the 2014 meeting held to review the defeat, it was raised that the party broadcast the programs of welfare of minorities so loudly that Yadav too became 'hindu' in the resistance and the BJP Voted mana ja rahaa he ki akhilesh ne yahi baat dhyaan main rakh alag se muslimon ke liye kisi kalyankari yojana kaa vaayada manch se nahin kiya
 He talked about every section of women, students, youth, poor, farmers, businessmen but the minority section which has always been an important part of the sp's manifesto was missing this time
 pichhali baar kii tarah is baar ke ghoshnaptr main na to muslim aarakshan kii baat thi, na aatank ke aarope main pakade gaye bekasoor muslim yuvakon kii rihaai kaa hi koi vaayada tha
 No big promise was made by Akhilesh on Urdu education or madrasas
 'moulana' mulaayam vaali chhavi nahin chaahate akhiledkhilesh ke is ghoshnaa patr ke baad muslim naujavaanon ke adhikaron kii ladaai lard rahe sanghathan rihaai manch ne unpar muslimon ke muddon se peeche hatane kaa aarope lagaaya, haalanki siyaasi jaankaar ise akhilesh kii duuradrushti vaala faisla maan rahe hai
 Akhilesh's father Mulayam Singh Yadav has been doing politics for Muslim interests
 muslimon kaa unhen bharpoor sahyog bhi mila he
 At one time his staunch opponents started calling him 'maulana' Mulayam
 mana ja rahaa he ki akhilesh apane pita kii isi chhavi se khud ko baahar nikaalnaa chaahate hai
 The populist proclamations he has made for women, children, the poor and the malnourished will benefit the Muslim section like everyone else, but they will not be accused of appeasement politics
 upi se baahar sapa ke vistaar kaa agendakhilesh ke is kadam ke peeche ek kaaran upi ke baahar sapa ke vistaar kii unki yojana se judaa bhi ho saktaa he
 Be it Mulayam or Lalu Prasad Yadav, both the leaders got a lot of success in their state due to Muslim votes in UP and Bihar respectively, but due to their Muslim upbringing image, they could not become popular outside their state and the existence of their parties was limited to their state
 Stayed
 akhilesh ne jis tarah vikaas ko agenda banaaya he or har varg ko us agenda main shaamil kiya he use yadi upi main safalataa milti he to ve duusare hindi bhashi pradeshon main isi agenda ke bal par samaajawaadee party ko ek raajnneetik takat ke rup main sthapit kar sakate hai
 There will be a huge risk behind this decision of Akhilesh if the Muslim votes are lost
 upi kaa vidhansabha chunaav is baar trikoniya he
 With only a few percent of the votes moving here and there, the power of the parties can move from here to there
 basapa or sapa ke liye jeet yaa haar kaa nirnay unke paramparaagat jatav-yadav voton ke alaava muslim voton ko hi karnaa he
 Mayawati is constantly sending this message to the Muslim community that only the BSP can protect their interests
 unhone badi sankhya main muslimon ko tikat baante hai
 During the tumult in the party, Mulayam Singh Yadav himself accused Akhilesh of being anti-muslim
 agar muslim voter ise lekar sapa se naaraaz hua or basapa ke paale main chalaa gaya to apane pehle hi siyaasi morche par akhilesh ko karaari shikast jhelni pad sakati he
 The Congress continues to hold office for president
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik priyanka gandhi se congress ke senior netaaon dwardhyaksh pad ke bare main poocha gaya tha ki kya vah party kii bagdor sanbhaalanaa chahengi?is sawaal ke jawaab main priyanka ne congress ke varisht netaaon se kaha ki adhyaksh pad kaasawaal hi paidaa nahin hota he
 And my name should not be considered as an alternative to this post
 unhone kaha ki vah party menmahasachiv ke pad par aage bhikaam karti rahengi
 According to the information, senior Congress leaders have been asked to give a name in a closed envelope
 is pad ke liye ab tak sahmati nahin ban pai he
 In the process of the post of Congress President, the names of 7 senior Congress leaders have been included, including Mallikarjun Kharge, Sushil Kumar Shinde, Digvijay Singh, Shailaja, Mukul Wasnik, Sachin Pilot and Scindia
 aapako bataa den ki congress pehle ek antarim adhyaksh kaa chunaav karegi or iske baad aantarik chunaav karwaae jaaenge
 The concept of working presidents is not possible till then
 jab tak party kaa adhyaksh yaa antarim adhyaksh isse sahamat nahin ho
 Many senior leaders of the party had publicly expressed their wish that Priyanka Gandhi should take over the reins of the party after Rahul Gandhi's resignation
 bataa den, loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii haar kii naitik jimmedaari lete hue rahul gandhi ne party ke adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya tha
 Since then, the party is yet to decide the chairman
 rahul gandhi ne is maheene kii shuruyaat main ek chaar pej kaa patr likhte hue apana istipha saarvajanik kiya tha
 At the moment, Rahul Gandhi's return is awaited
 jaankaree ke mutabik rahul gandhi kewapas aate hi seedblusiki ek meeting bulaakar congress adhyaksh pad or party kii bhavishya kii yojanaon par vichaar kiya jayega
 The cracks in the relations between Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal, which came together on the Jan Lokpal Bill, shows the Anna interview given to date, where this elderly leader refused to even bless his former disciple
 gave
 anna or kejariwal ke vyaktigat sambandhon main katutaa saaf najar aa rahi he
 Anna is undoubtedly annoyed by Kejriwal's entry into politics or doubts about the amount of donations, yet his anger is incomprehensible
 jis kejariwal se hameshaa vah vichaar-vimarsh karte the, jinaki raay se vah kadam badhaate rahe or jo andolan main unke saath-saath rahaa, uske ek kadam se vah itnaa naaraaz kyon ho gaye?janalokapal bill par unka itnaa bada andolan sarkaar ko vah kanoon laane ko vivash nahin kar sakaa, jiske bare main unka maananaa he ki vah desh main eemaandaaree se shashan kii guarantee degaa, to phir kejariwal kaa raajnneeti main kudana naaraazgi kii vazah kyon ho gai?raajnneeti se apane ko dur rakhane kaa unka faisla prashansaneey he, lekin unke bill ko paas karwaane kii jimmedaari antat raajnneetigyon kii hi he
 Anna knows this thing well, then what crime did Kejriwal commit by leaping into the world of politics? Is he still in a mood to say that he will get that historic bill in this country, which will change the situation Will go? But, nothing like this is going to happen
 ek karmyogi kii tarah vah beshak prayaas karte rahen, lekin sachai yah he ki ab is maamle main koi khaas pragati hoti nahin dikhti, kyonki hamaare rajaneta apane pairon par kulhadi kabhi nahin maarenge
 Arvind Kejriwal's path is long and arduous
 raajnneeti ke daldal main ghuskar shuchita kii talash unke liye ek nayaa anubhav hoga
 He also did not commit such a big crime by deciding that Anna should be so angry that he should not even bless
 beshak vah kejariwal kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon se apane ko dur rakhen lekin shubhakamana ke do bol yaa aashirwad ke vachan unhen apane purv shishy kii raajnneetik muhim kaa hissaa to nahin hi bana denge

 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ke baad trinmul congress (TMC) ke saansadon ko bhi upi sarkaar ne sonbhadra jane se roak diya he

 Derek o'brien said that the ADM and SP told us that we are being detained because Section 144 is applicable here
 lekin hamanen unhen kaha ki ham teen log hai or dhara 144 lagu hone kii surat main paanch yaa paanch se zyada log agar saath jaaen tabhi uskaa ulanghan mana jaataa he
 But we are just ham yahaan se biechayu trama centre jane kii koshish karenge jahaan sonbhadra kii ghatana main ghayal hue logon ko rakhaa gaya he
 Significantly, before this, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi was also barred from going to Sonbhadra
 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra ne waapas laut jane kii adhikariyon kii salaah nahin maanate hue chunaar guest house main raat kaati
 The second round of talks between Priyanka and the officials from about 12:00 pm to 1:15 pm also failed and Priyanka and hundreds of her supporters stayed in the Chunar Guest House
 priyanka ne der raat kiye gaye silsilewar twit main bataaya ki uttar pradesh sarkaar ne varanasi jone ke apper police mahanideshak brijbhushan, varanasi ke mandlayukta deepak agarwal or police upmahanireekshak ko mujhase yah kehane ke liye bheja ki main yahaan peediton se mili bagaiyr waapas chali jaaun
 Neither i have been told the basis of detention nor any papers were given
 unhone ek or twit main kaha ki mere vakeelon ke mutabik meri giraftaar har tarah se gaiyrkanoonee he
 i have made it clear that i have come to meet the victims, not to violate any clause
 maine sarkaar ke duuton se kaha he ki main unase mili bagaiyr waapas nahin jaaoongi
 Priyanka has also tweeted a video in which senior administrative and police officers are seen going back after ending their meeting at around 1:15 pm
 priyanka or anya samarthakon ke saath chunaar guest house main maujuud congress vidhanmandal dal ke netaa ajay kumaar lallu ne shanivaar ko 'bhashaa' ko bataaya ki sarkaar bijli or pani kii aapurti band karke unhen guest house chhodane par majaboor kar rahi he lekin unke kadam peeche nahin hatenge
 They said that there was no electricity all night
 is dauraan priyanka subah kareeb 4:30 baje tak kaaryakartaaon ke saath baithi raheen
 The government did not make any arrangements for refreshments in the guest house
 sthaneey naagarik or party kaaryakarta hi kuch prabandh kar rahe hai
 It is known that Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was stopped and taken into custody under Section 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code in Adalhat area of mirzapur on Friday while going to meet the families of the victims of mass murder in Sonbhadra
 baad main unhen chunaar guest house laayaa gaya tha
 The top officials of the administration asked him to return saying that Section 144 was applicable in Sonbhadra but Priyanka replied that he was ready to go to Sonbhadra alone to meet the victims
 aise main nishedhagna kaa tanik bhi ulanghan nahin hoga
 She said clearly and she will not go back without meeting him
 tab se shuru hua gatirodh abhi tak jari he
 Indian captain Virat Kohli has said that winning the Test series for the first time in Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) would be a big achievement, as it was from this ground that the beginning of the team's change under his captaincy began
 mahendra singh dhoni ke sanyas lene ke baad kohli ne chaar saal pehle isi maidan par bhartiya test captain ke rup main jimmedaari sanbhali thi
 India was then the world's number seven team and is now the world's number one team in this format
 team india chaar maichon kii siries main 2-1 kii ajey badhat ke saath border-gavaskar trophy ko apane paas barkaraar rakhana tay kar chuki he
 Kohli said on Thursday, on the eve of the fourth and final Test, "it has been only four years (let me take over as captain)"
 agar aisa hota he, to yah shandaar hoga
 Because this is the third time i have come here on a Test tour and i know how difficult it is to win here
 ’ bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘aap australia main acha pradarshan kar sakate hai, lekin team ke rup main jeet darj karnaa hamaare liye sabase badi chunauti rahi he
 To be honest, no one remembers the individual performances of the last two rounds
 ’mahamuqabla kal se, itihaas rachane utregi viraat brigadekohli ne kaha ki antim test jeetna pradarshan main nirantarata hasil karne kii taraf ek or kadam badhanaa hoga
 He said, 'your name may have been written on the board with respect, but it does not matter if your team does not win
 ab tak yah badi cheez he, badi siries jeet, sirf mere liye hi nahin, lekin puri team ke liye bhi
 Because this is where we started the transition phase
 ’bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘isi sthal par jab mahendra singh dhoni ne captaini chodi (2014 main) thi or hamaari team kaaphi yuva thi, duniya kii chathe yaa saatven (test ranking) number kii team
 We are back here as the number one team in the world and we want to carry forward this legacy
 ’kohli ne kaha ki unki team ke liye jeetna ‘junun’ ban gaya he
 He said, 'if you look, after the last wicket fell in the last match, everyone's feelings came out, even the lowest speaking players
 kyonki hamen pataa he ki ek team ke rup main agar aap ek disha main jor lagaate ho to chijen sahi hoti hai or yah junun hona chahie
 Kohli said, "if it's passion, it won't stop in one-two matches
" agar yah lakshya he, to yah ek yaa do maichon main ruk jayega

 Yes, this song must have been heard on youtube
 imran ne kaha, main khud ko ab serial kisar kii image se baahar laa chukaa hum
 When asked why do you want to do this, Imran's direct answer was that it is not easy to become a serial kisser
 lekin ab main 17 saal se kising seen karte-karte thak gaya hum
 It is not easy to do 20 kissing scenes in a film
 sahi kahuun to ab ek ritred kisar hum

 Imran Khan, who found this remedy, said, 'the incident of gang rape in Delhi on December 16 last year inspired me to make this security ring which women can wear against their right hand index finger and can avoid the murderers and murderers
 '30 varshiya khan dwaara banaai gai 'sting bi' chaandi kii anguthi aatmaraksha ke liye ek vishwasaneey kavach he
 The upper part of the ring is a liquid chemical compound (capsaicin)
 yah padaarth chote se chhed se baahar nikalataa he
 Which makes the attacker vulnerable to the woman as well as stabilizing her
 'sting bi' anguthi ke ek purv pradarshan ke maukey par khan ne kaha, 'capasian kalimirch se chaar guna garm or or guntur laal mirch se 300 guna zyada tikhaa he hota he
 By means of the micro-pump and micro-needle in the ring, when this capsaic reaches the culprit's body, it stimulates the end of the chemoceptor nerve of the skin, causing pain for 45–60 minutes
 'upar kii ore rfidi (radio frequency aaidentification) or dohari band vyavastha anguthi ke durupyog ko rokatii he
 The ring can be made of any metal
 khan ne bataaya, 'yah upkaran chhedchhad rahit he or ise chalaanaa aasaan he
 Its 0
 2 millilitre capsicine vaala sookshm tanks ek baar khulne par paanch logon ko inject kar saktaa he
 And gives the wearer ample time to escape
 'khan ne chaandi kii angoothiyon ke liye mumbai ke ek sunar or inamen dawa bharne ke liye shahar kii farmesi se samjhauta kiya he
 Khan said, 'A silver ring without 5% tax and delivery charges will cost Rs 1,999
 yah order dene par banaai jaaegi or ek hafte ke andar courier ke madhyam se puure bharat main kahin bhi bheji jaaegi
 It will take Rs 1,000 each time to replenish the canister (micro-tank) with capecicin
 mahilaon ko shikshit karne or anguthi ke prachaar ke liye khan 'seve maai sistar cheritable trust' se jud gaye hai
 Khan has also built a call center whose helpline number is 080-6450-0112

 At Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann's rally in Malaut on Saturday, 10 people were injured due to a clash between AAP and Akali Dal supporters

 ) baba ramdev kii yogyata par congress ne sawaal uthaaya he
 This question has been raised on making him the brand ambassador of Yoga and Ayurveda in Haryana
 haryana sarkaar ke purv mantri sanpat singh nebaba ramdevaki shaikshik yogyata par sawaal khadey karte hue haryana sarkaar se faisla waapas lene kii maang kii he
 Whether or not Baba Ramdev has made any new discovery in yoga is not a question
 baba ramdevne yoga kii koi nai theory di he yaa nahin, sawaal ye bhi nahin he
 Whether or not Baba Ramdev has propounded any new mode of yoga is also not a question
 yaa aisa koi sawaal nahin he
 The question is whether Baba Ramdev can be the brand ambassador of the government
 aakhir kisi brands ambesder kaa kaam kya hota he? brands ambesder us khaas brands yaa product ko pramot karata he, yahi nahin
 Works to disseminate it
 product ke yugers ko uski khaasiyat bataata or samajhaata he
 Since ordinary people listen to his words or believe him blindly, the product makes its way into people - and it expands
 haa, ye baaten baba ramdev ke ayurveda ke gyaan par lagu nahin hoti
 The same does not apply to his claim of homosexuality treatment
 ye baat unke aids ko bhi kyor kar lene ke daawey par katai lagu nahin hoti
 From toothpaste and chyawanprash to all their products, this also does not apply
 baba ramdev yaa unke sahyogi acharya baalkrishna dwaara sujhaaye jane vaale ilaaj ke nuskhon par bhi ye baat lagu nahin hoti
 There are valid agencies in the country to decide what is the standard of Baba Ramdev's product
 wo kisi ko dawa prescrib kar sakate hai ki nahin iske liye bhi adhikrut agenciyaan hai - or isaki jaanch yaa kisi tarah kii karrwai karne ke liye ve adhikruti hai
 But does this not mean that Baba Ramdev cannot promote Yoga and Ayurveda? People cannot tell the goodness of Yoga and Ayurveda
 yoga or ayurveda ko apnaane ke liye logon ko protsaahit nahin kar sakate
 What should be the educational qualification for 'brand Ambassador'? Who can decide this qualification? Who has the right to decide this? Certainly, this right belongs solely to the organization or company that makes any person a brand ambassador of his or her own product
 bollywood star karina kapur ‘alpenlibe 2 choko iklair’ kii brands ambesder hai
 So should they be an expert in chocolate tester or chocolate making method
 cricket star sachin tendulkar mashhoor german car company bmdablyoo ke brand ambesder hai
 Now will Tendulkar also have to be an automobile expert for this? By the way, the opposition's rhetoric about the functioning of the government is proof of its existence
 sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par sawaal khadey karnaa vipaksh kaa haq he
 Yoga was not a new thing for the country
 desh main shaayad hi aisa koi vyakti hoga jise yoga ke bare main pataa na ho
 It is also not that before Baba Ramdev, no program was shown on TV about yoga
 lekin baba ramdev ne jis tarah yoga ko ghar ghar pahunchaaya
 Connected yoga with common people
 yoga ke prati har kisi main ruchi jagaai
 It is no match to make thousands of people a part of everyday life
 vaise baba ramdev ko kai sansthaanon ne doctoret kii maanad oopaadhi de rakhi he
 In such a situation, the questions on his schooling are of little importance, except political opinion
 bhartiya cricket team ke purv openar or dhakad ballebaaj gautam gambhaar ne bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kaa daaman tham liya
 It is believed that Gambhir can contest the Lok Sabha elections from the BJP seat of New Delhi
 jab ise lekar patrakaron ne nai dilli se maujuuda saansad or is seat par apana daawa thok rahi minakshi lekhi se unke tikat katane ko lekar sawaal poocha to wo bhadak gai
 In fact, on the one hand, in the presence of two Union ministers, Gambhir was joining the BJP, on the other hand, an important meeting of the BJP was going on
 baithak main raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman se lekar se lekar kendriya mantri doctor harshavardhan jaise bijepi ke bade netaa maujuud the
 The meeting ended and when Meenakshi Lekhi was questioned about the ticket distribution, she went stung
 dilli pradesh bijepi daftar kii baithak main rajya ke maujuuda saansadon ke bhavishya par charchaa chal rahi thi
 Where Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was discussing the tickets in the state office
 dilli ke ummidavaaron par der tak hui charchaa ke baad jab nai dilli seat kii saansad minakshi lekhi baahar nikaleen to unke tevar kuch zyada hi talkh the
 The selection process for bjp's seven candidates from Delhi is in the final stages
 gautam gambhir ke shaamil hone ke kaaphi samay pehle se hi unke nai dilli seat se ladane kii atakalein jari hai
 When the media came out of the meeting of BJP core committee, Parliamentary Meenakshi Lekhi stood in the dock, when she was asked about Gautam Gambhir, she said that it is a very good thing, everybody is sabotage, joining our party from all sides 
 iskaa matlab he ki hamaari party acha karne ja rahi he
 Soon after, when Gambhir was asked to get a ticket from the New Delhi seat, he put the media in the dock
 minakshi lekhi ne kaha ki ye jo phek news media chalaa rahaa hai ise band kar dijie
 The BJP is looking for candidates after the meeting of the BJP-BJP core committee, three names have been decided on the seats in Delhi and sent to the Central Election Committee
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne bataaya ki dilli ke saaton saansadon ke naamon par charchaa hui or bijepi loktantric prakriya ke tahat ummidavaaron kaa chayan karegi
 Manoj Tiwari said that we are looking for the best candidate for Delhi and the party will announce the names soon
 pradhanmantri se prabhavit hue gautamabijapi main shaamil hone ke baad gautam gambhir ne kaha ki unhone pradhanmantri naredra modi ke vijan se prabhavit hokar bijepi kii sadasyita grahan kii he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the arrival of Gautam Gambhir will benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party and BJP will also use Gambhir's talent
 vahiin, tikat milane ke sawaal par jetali ne kaha ki yah nirnay loksabhaa chunaav se judi cameti karegi, abhi isapar antim faisla nahin liya gaya he

 CPI leader Brinda Karat, in an exclusive discussion from today till date, gave his impeccable opinion on the issue of Army Chief and Election Commission
 sandip dikshit dwaara army chif ke bayaan ke vishay par karaat ne kaha ki sandip dikshit ne jo bayaan diya he vah ek vishesh sandarbh main diya he unhone iske liye maafee maang lee he isliye is matter ko ab khatm kar diya janaa chahie
 Apart from this, Brinda Karat, when asked by the Election Commission to demand the right of contempt from the government, said that if the Election Commission really feels that its reputation has been damaged then they can take the path of the court
 lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki chunaav ayog ko abhi aisi kisi shaktiyon kii zarurat he
 Brinda Karatne took a dig at the Army Chief and asked if the Central Government has given him a certificate to make such absurd statements
 army chifjo kahana chaah rahe hai main samajhati hum yah bilkul galat tha or is prakaar kaa bayaan hamaare desh ke army chif ko bilkul shobhaa nahin detaa
 They should avoid this type of rhetoric
 is prakaar ke bayaan jab die jaaenge to zaahir he ki saath main 10 sawaal or uthenge or vah uthenge to aapattijanak bayaan bhi ho sakate hai to yah army kii credibility or army chif kii credibility par nishchit rup se nuksaan pahunchaata he
 Therefore, the army chief must control himself
 unhone aage kaha aap dekhie ki khud bijepi ke netaa gandhi ji ke bare main aise galat bayaan dete hai jab wo khud itane ghatiya bayaan dete hai tab bijepi us par chup kyon hai
 Opinion on the Election Commission: Brinda Karat said on the Election Commission's view that the details of the Election Commission's suggestions have not come to us yet, but based on what i have read so far, i understand that the context of the Election Commission content What i am writing, our party does not understand that it is very important at this time
 agar vaaki main koi gambhir mudde aate hai jise ellection kamishan samajhati he ki unki pratishtha ko haani hui ho or unki credibility par chot hui ho tab nishchit rup se vah court ja sakate hai
 The Election Commission has a court route ahead, but i do not think the Election Commission needs any such powers right now
 is desh main sabhi ko aalochana karne kaa adhikaar he lekin sawaal yah he ki aalochana ke daayre main agar chunaav ayog samajhataa he ki manahani ho rahi he to vah court ja sakate hai

 ek bahut mashhoor kahawat he, kabhi naav par hathi, kabhi hathi par naav
 On the issue on which the BJP once surrounded the Congress, today the Congress gave a new name to the BJP
 congress netaa pawan kheda ne bijepi kaa nayaa namakaran kiya haih bahut zyada price
 Apparently, the Congress party has tried to surround the BJP on making CNG and LPG expensive
 kheda ne kaha ki aam logon kii bachat par daaka daalana bhaajapa kaa purana or jamaya hua nuskhaa he
 Kheda said that at first the petrol and diesel skyrocketed and then by increasing the prices of LPG and CNG, the BJP has attacked the common man
 congress pravaktaa ne kaha ki sarkaar kii ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he or janata is jan-virdohi modi sarkaar ko chunaav main karaara jawaab degi
 Holding the government's tax terror responsible for this increase in the price of fuels, the Congress said that there are only a few months left in the election and this will prove to be the last nail in the government's coffin
 achche dinon kaa sapana aisa tuutakar bikhar gaya he ki uski ab marammat bhi nahin kii ja sakati he
 People are fed up with this loot on the pretext of petrol
 gauratlab he ki modi sarkaar ke satta main aane ke baad se rasoi gas kii keemton main chaar sau ru
 Has increased jabaki prakritik gas kii keemat main bhi 10 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he jiskaa asar sienji, pienji, uria or urvarkon tathaa bijli kii keemton par pad rah he
 1 in CNG, PNG prices in Delhi
 70 ru
 and 1
 30 ru
 Per kilogram has been increased
 iskaa arth hua ki bijli utpaadan par bhi iskaa asar padegaa or bijli ke bill bhi adhik aaenge
 If this is combined with the increased prices of petrol and diesel, then the entire budget of a common man's house will be shattered
 congress ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne kya isi din ke liye madhya varg se gas kii sabsidi chhodane kii apli kii thi?durbhaagya se, unka yah jumala garibon or madhya varg donon ko maar gaya he
 Remember that 14 in May 2014

 Rs 399 in 52 months

 Similarly, subsidized cylinders cost Rs 412

 congress ne aarope lagaaya ki ujjwala yojana ko prachaarit to bahut kiya gaya par duusari baar feeling kii koi guarantee nahin he
 1600 Rs

 That too the beneficiary has to pay in installments

 But the lack of resources with the beneficiary is the reason for the failure of the scheme
 petrol or dijal kii keemton par upie or endie sarkaar ke bich tulana karte hue congress pravaktaa pawan kheda ne kaha ki congress ke beete din bhaajapa ke achche dinon se behatar the
 He said that in May 2014 the price of petrol was 71

 bijepi main shaamil kiye jane ke 24 ghante ke bheetar party se nikaale gaye purv rajyasabha sadsy sabir ali ne bijepi upaadhyaksh mukhtaar abbaas nakvi par hamalaa tej kar diya he
 Ali challenged Naqvi to prove the allegation leveled against him that he had a relationship with Indian Mujahideen co-founder Yasin Bhatkal
 ali ne kaha ki yadi nakvi is aarope ko sabit nahin kar pate hai to unhen maafee maangani hogi
 Ali said, 'I am ready to go to Naqvi's house or he can come to my house
 mujh par lagaae gaye aaropon par charchaa kar sakate hai or saboot de sakate hai
 If he is right, then i am ready for crucifixion
 ’bijepi se nikaale jane se pehle jadyu se bhi nikaale ja chuke ali ne daawa kiya ki ‘‘nakvi ko laga hoga ki mere aane se party main unki sthiti ko khatra paidaa ho jayega
 The inclusion of Ali in the BJP created discontent within the party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was not happy with the party's decision
 party ke bheetar paidaa hue asantosh or sangh kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue ali ko shanivaar ko bijepi se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya tha
 Naqvi called Ali a 'friend of terrorist Bhatkal' and strongly opposed his inclusion in the party, terming it a 'mistake' that needs reform
 ali ne ravivaar ko ek samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki unke khilaaf lagaae gaye aarope puri tarah bebuniyaad hai
 '
 
 
 to nakvi ke ghar baahar dharne par baithungi'ali ne kaha ki un par lagaae gaye aarope se vah or unka puraa parivaar prabhavit hua he, lihaaja nakvi iske liye maafee maangen yaa aarope sabit karen
 Ali's wife present during the press conference threatened that if Naqvi did not apologize, she would sit on a dharna outside Naqvi's house
 ali kii patni ne kaha, ‘main 24 ghante ke bheetar nakvi se maafinama chaahati hum jisamen unke bayaan kii vajah bhi likhi gayi ho
 Otherwise, they should present evidence in relation to their allegations
 ’ purv saansad kii patni ne kaha, ‘24 ghante ke baad bhi yadi vah aisa karne main naakaam rahete hai
 
 
 So i will sit on a dharna in front of their house
 yadi mujhe sachai ke liye shahid hona padaa to main nakvi ke ghar ke baahar hi shahadat duungi
 Ali, who threatened to sue Naqvi for defamation, said, "it has been 56 hours since Naqvi was challenged to argue or present evidence related to the charge
" ab tak unka koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 Ali said, "we have prepared the notice and my lawyer will give them the notice
" maine unhen chunauti di he or aaj phir yah baat kahata hum
 'he said,' The foundation of lies is always weak
 main chah saal tak rajyasabha sadsy rahaa, main jadyu main tha
 At that time nobody said anything

 Similarly, the rate of property of c category has increased from 27 thousand to 54, 600 thousand
 vahiin sabase nichali category yani je catagori kaa cirkil rate 6900 rupee se badhkar 13, 800 hazaar ho gaya he

 kehete hai ki kismat meharbaan to gadhaa pahalwaan! lekin koi gadhaa agar pahalwaan nahin naayab tehseeldaar banane kii hasarat paal le to aap kya kahenge
 But believe me, a donkey from Jammu and Kashmir has determined this stubbornness and the government of Jammu and Kashmir has agreed to see the ability of this donkey to be a human being in the test to become the naib tehsildar
 Take part in the competition with and prove that the donkey can not become a horse, can sit on the chair of Naib Tehsildar in Jammu and Kashmir
 mashhoor sahityakar krushan chander kii mulaakaat shaayad isi kaabil gadhe se hui hogi jo unhone gadhe kii aatmakatha jaisaa mashhoor upanyaas likh daalaa
 By now you might be wondering what this is about donkeys - how can any animal be included in the ordeal of humans
 lekin kya aapane kisi kitaab main aisa padhaa he ki gadhaa mandabuddhi hota he? gadhe ko murkh maananaa choti soch he
 At least the Jammu Kashmir Services Selection Board (JKSSB) does not believe so
 isliye usne kachur khaar naam ke gadhe ko naayab tehseeldaar ko 29 april ko hone vaali pariksha main shaamil hone kaa edimat card jari kar diya
 If you are not sure, see yourself
 dekhie card par kachur khaar naam ke isnaayab gadheki photo bhi lagi he jise srinagar ke khanyaar ilaake main government girls hai skool main jaakar pariksha main shaamil bhi hona he
 We decided to do a viral test of this news
 is khabar ko log soshal media par khub chatkhaare lekar saajha kar rahe the
 It was expected that someone would have made it viral by putting a picture of a donkey on a straight candid candidate's photo for fun
 lekin jab hamane JKSSB kii website par jaakar kachur khaar kaa naam, pita kaa naam krihan khaar or jammadin 1 janvari 1990 daal kar dekha to hairaan rah gaye
 This name was registered with the same registration number as JKSSB
 yani gadhaa website ke bheetar bhi maujuud tha
 However, after getting upset over this matter, JKSSB has now stopped downloading the admit card of Kachoon Khar
 ab kachur khaar ke bare main hamaari dilchaspee or bad gai
 It turned out that Kachoon Khar means brown donkey in Kashmiri
 kachun ke pita kaa naam krihun khaar he jiskaa matlab kaala gadhaa hota he
 But how did Kachoon Khar achieve success in registering his name in the JKSSB website
 khojbin se pataa chalaa ki jammu kashmir main jaanwaron ke admit card paane kaa ye pehla vakya nahin he
 Earlier, Kachir village i
e
 golden cow has also got the admit card
 ye kamaal hua tha 2015 main
 When the polytechnic diploma was being tested in Jammu Kashmir Board of Professional Examination
 jab hamane is bare main JKSSB ke chairman simrandeep singh se baat karne kii to unhone is bare main kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 It was quite clear that the officials are embarrassed by this lapse and they have no answer to give
 darasal aplication farm par di gai jaankaree or photo ke aadhaar par jaankaree ko system main daalane kaa kaam computer or scinar ke jariye hota he
 Ideally, a responsible person should check the application forms
 lekin jammu kashmir main aisa nahin ho rahaa he
 Therefore, someone decided to prove the system as a donkey by putting a picture of a donkey
 viral test main khabar sahi nikali
 On the go, it is important to mention that Krishna Chander of the donkey's ability was so convincing that he wrote three novels on the donkey
 ek upanyaas kaa naam he - gadhe kii vaapasi
 That is, if Kashmir officials do not care, then Kachur Khar can get the admit card again under a new name

 karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi (EPF) par milane vaali byaaj dar ko farvari main badhaakar 8
 65 per cent was proposed
 ab khabar aa rahi he ki IL&FS main nivesh se nuksaan or anya vajahon se pief ke prastaavit byaaj dar main aadha se ek fisadi tak katautee kii ja sakati he
 The Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Labor to review the rate
 hindustan times ke anusaar, vitt varsh 2018-19 ke liye pief par milane vaale byaaj dar main katautee par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Rate of interest on PF 8 during FY 2017-18
 55 fisadi ke paanch saal ke nichle str par aa gai thi, lekin is saal farvari main modi sarkaar ne byaaj dar badhaakar 8
 65 per cent was proposed
 isse kareeb 45 lakh logon ko phayda hota
 But there was no notification about it yet
 khabar ke anusaar, ab vitt mantralay ne is prastaav par aapatti kii he
 One reason for this is also being told about the investment of PF funds in the troubled company IL&FS
 akhbaar ke anusaar shram sachiv ko 7 june ko bheje letters main vitt mantri ne kaha he, 'ipiefo ke sabsakribar ke liye jo byaaj dar dena tay kiya gaya he, uski gananaa ipiefo skim niyamon ke praavdhaanon ke anuroop nahin he
 In addition, investments in the IL&FS group may also suffer some losses
 isliye shram evam rojgaar mantralay ko hamaari yah salaah he ki vitt varsh 2018-19 ke liye aise upyukt byaaj dar par vichaar karen jisase ipiefo ke paas sarplus bana rahe
 The PF of the private sector employees of the country is managed by the Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) and the final decision on the interest rate is made by its Central Board of Trustees (CBT)
 yah shram mantralay ke tahat hi aata he
 The CBT is headed by the Minister of Labor and consists of representatives of the Central and State Governments, labor unions, industry chambers
 sibiti se jude kai sadsy vitt mantralay ke is letters kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 He says that in the case of EPFO, the finance ministry cannot interfere because it does not take any grant from the government
 iske alaava agar IL&FS main nivesh se koi nuksaan hua he, to iske liye sarkaar jimmedaar he, kyonki fund ke nijee companiyon main nivesh kii ijaajat usee ne di thi
 However, a source has also told the newspaper that the main reason for reducing the interest rate on PF is not the loss due to investment in IL&FS
 unka kahana he ki IL&FS main ipiefo kaa nivesh bahut kam he
 Actually, the interest rate of PF is higher than small savings schemes and bank deposits
 inhen pratispardhi banaae rakhane ke liye yah jaruri he ki pief byaaj dar ko ek seemaa tak rakhaa jaae

 The Secret Superstar took four days to earn as much as Aamir's previous film Dangal earned (30 crore) on Opening Day
 yah pichley kuch saalon main aamir ke filmon kii sabase kharaab opening he
 Even the first day collection of Dhobi Ambush released in 2011
 78 karod rupee ke kareeb tha
 Secret Superstar released on 1100 screens in India on Diwali on Thursday 4

 Thus the film grossed 34 in the Indian market
 36 karod kaa collection kiya
 In Overseas too, the film till Monday had around 20
 22 karod rupee tak kaa collection kiya
 The budget of the film is said to be between 40-50 crores
 haalanki mekars ne is bare main kuch khulaasa nahin kiya he
 Golmaal earned Rs 164 crore in 7 days, what was the failure of this collection every day? This time Aamir missed in many places
 hakeekat main ye film 15 saal kii insiya or gharelu hinsa kii shikaar uski maa najma ke sangharsh kii kahani he
 But the campaign only featured Insia's story
 kuch kaa maananaa he ki marketing ke dauraan insiya kii maa kii kahani ko chhipaana film ke liye ghaatak sabit hua
 Confusion was created among the people about the story
 diwali ko relies hona bhi film ke kaarobaar par asar daalane vaala sabit hua
 It is believed that during the week of Diwali, people have to watch a light-hearted entertaining film
 sikret superstar kaa is hafte relies hona galat nahin tha, golmaal agen jaisi masala se bharpoor film se ise nuksaan ho gaya
 Secret superstars also got less screens because of the breakup
 box offis par film ke kamjor hone kii ek badi vajah yah bhi he ki aamir kaa charitra utana lanbaa nahin he jitna hona chahie tha
 Zaira has done her part better than she expected, but Aamir's presence in the film is the most entertaining
 kahani ko nuksaan pahunchaae bina shakti kumaar ke kairactor kaa lanbaa hona kamai ke lihaaj se film ko phayda pahunchaa saktaa tha

 a two-hour photo shoot with Indian cricketer Ishant Sharma gives us a good chance to understand how to study a personality
 jab ve gendbaaji ke liye maidan par hote hai to dil, dimag or roen-roen se tej gendbaaj hote hai: aakraamak, joshilay or khoonkhaar!lekin jab ham unhen studio main camere ke saamne push-ap karte dekhte hai, to hairat main pad jate hai
 On the emphasis of the art director, they try to create a certain kind of style
 aisi dasha main dekhakar koi bhi kah baithegaa ki yahi he wo 24 saal kaa tej-tarraar gendbaaj? ji haa
 It is not easy to understand this double personality
 shaatir or khoonkhaar tej gendbaaj vaali apni image par ve bade hi shaleen andaaj main muskaraakar tippanee karte hai: ''ve saare aakraamak tevar to bas tabhi tak ke liye hote hai, jab ki main maidan par hota hum
 Off the field, i am a very normal human like you
 bowling ko behatar banane ke liye maine acha-khaasaa pasinaa bahaya he or ab main chahta hum ki us mehnat kaa zyada se zyada nateeja nikle
 Do not be deceived
 is shant shakhsiyat ke peeche maidan main jang main tapa hua ek kalejaa chipa he
 He returned again after being removed from the team and then became one of the most dangerous strike bowlers in world cricket
 aaie unki kahani unheen kii jabaani sunen:meri preranindia ke liye khelnaa or pratibhashali khiladinnon se bhari indian team main apni ahmiyat sabit karnaa, mere liye isse badi koi prerana nahin
 And it is interesting that all the players see the different types of pressure on the field from a different perspective
 jab ham dabaav kaa aage badhkar puri himmat or jazbe ke saath saamana karte hai to phir ham main badi mushkilon kaa saamana karne kaa madda paidaa hota he
 Take, for example, my over against England in the Champions Trophy final this year
 us vakt unhen 18 gendon main 28 ranon kii darkaar thi
 When Morgan hit my ball six and after that i threw two consecutive wides, i felt that today i was gone
 team par jabardast dabaav tha or mujhe ehsaas ho gaya tha ki kuch alag hatakar hi karnaa hoga
 Before throwing the next ball, i told myself that i have gone through a worse situation and will not allow any such failure
 agali hi do gendon main maine match kaa rukh palat diya
 i drove both Morgan and Bopara
 bharat champions trophy jeet gaya
 That is to say, do not always sit with satisfaction within your own realm
 khud ko jhakzoriye or naakaamiyon se do-chaar hoie
 When you overcome them, then you realize that there is no greater addiction than success in life
 hadein paar karnajitne kaa matlab he ki aapako dusron se dimagi taur par badhat hasil he
 The more emphasis you put on your mind and heart, the stronger you become in your mind, then it becomes difficult for anyone to beat you
 aapane dimag main apni jo bhi simaaen khinch rakhi hai, unase bhi aage jane kii jarurat he
 Try to get beyond what you were thinking of going
 ek baar aapane vah had paar kar lee to aapmen vah bharosa aa jaataa he
 a voice starts coming from inside that i have crossed that limit, from here i can take concrete steps towards success
 main ji-jaan or jazbe ke saath kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar hum
 See the failures, learn, the whole game is to believe in itself
 khud ko puure yakeen ke saath khadaa kiijie to koi takat aapako roak nahin sakati
 Never measure yourself above the scale of others
 apane prati eemaandaar rahiye to aap sukun main rahenge
 There was a time when i was at the highest point in my game
 tab main sochataa tha ki mujhe is jagah se koun diga saktaa he bhala? or phir vah din bhi aayaa ki mujhe team se nikaal diya gaya
 i was unable to understand what to do
 samaj hi nahin aa rahaa tha ki mujhe aakhir ho kya gaya
 i was so engrossed in the triumph of victory and defeat that my own efforts diverted my attention
 aaj main bahut sukun mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 Life is nothing but learning by doing things step by step
 anubhav kamyaabi kii kunjee he
 Do work that fills you with passion and passion and then show them as soon as possible
 tevar thande rakhengusse or aavesh ko puri tarah se khaarij mat kar dijie
 This is not a harmful thing
 salike se istemaal karen to yah aapke liye phydemand sabit ho saktaa he
 Just keep it under your control
 pataa kaise chale ki meri bhavanaaen mujhe par haaavee ho rahi hai? main jab bhi kharaab gend phenkata hum, main jaan jaataa hum ki main aavesh mujh par haaavee ho rahaa he
 As a cricketer, i want to put myself in a place where i can be aggressive, keep bowling with good line-length and make it difficult for a batsman to play
 gussell yaa aakraamak hona bura nahin par aapako tay karnaa hoga ki aap kis tarah kii manodasha main khud ko rakhana chaahate hai
 i always respect the competition: the desire to learn from rivals increases the scope of your personality
 australian khiladinnon kii style bahut pasand he
 Whatever his performance on the field, he is always positive
 isliye jindagi ke prati meraa najariya he: dabaav ke saamne jhuko mat, chaahe aapako chakka bhi pad chukaa ho
 Return to the run-up, remember your strengths, then hit the batsman standing between you and the wicket

 Bills are being burnt everywhere
 lekin yah tajjub kii baat he ki in teenon bijli companiyon ko 2010−11 main kareeb saadhe teen sau karod kaa phayda hua

 The question arises whether the companies intentionally showed a loss to DERC

 Now questions are being raised again
 kankaria kaa kahana he ki dekhie sarkaar kii mili-bhagat he
 Two types of balancesheets are shown
 bijli companiyon kaa kahana he ki bijli ke rate balance shit dekhakar badaye jate hai
 DERC would not have increased the tariff if the company was in profit

 Pakistan has failed to eradicate locusts from its border, due to which they are seen interfering in India
 china ne pakistan ko tiddiyon ko khatm karne ke liye kitnashak supplai kiya tha
 Locusts did not affect them due to the pesticide expiring
 ab iskaa khamiyaja bhartiya kisaan bhugat rahe hai
 To hide its failure, Pakistan had canceled a meeting with the grasshopper control department of India on 21 November
 is baithak se pehle bhi pakistan ek baithak radd kii thi

 Farmers are trying out unique tricks to drive locusts away

 After 27 years, such a large number of locusts has come from the Pakistani border
 tiddiyon ke hamale se pareshaan kisaanon ne shanivaar ko jila colector karyaalay main pradarshan bhi kiya,saath hi colector ko gyaapan bhi saunpa he
 At the same time, the villagers allege that even after sending dozens of calls and videos to the locust department, no action is being taken on their behalf
 tiddiyon ke hamale se ramgarh, lathi, chaandhn, naachna or mohangarh sabase zyada prabhavit hue hai
 The trend of locusts is not stopping, farmers of Jaisalmer district are not getting relief from locust parties
 ab tiddiyon ke saath saath un par niyantran karne vaale vibhaag se bhi pareshaan ho rahi he
 Teams are not arriving on time and the losses continue to increase

 If laughing is good for health then crying is also not bad for health
 hansane ke jitne phaayde hai, usase kam rone ke bhi nahin hai
 Whether you are crying after watching a movie or cutting onions and tears come from your eyes, these are good for your health
 aansu bhi teen prakaar ke hote hai, recolexive, continius, imotional, kya aapako pataa he ki keval insaan hi teesri tarah se ro sakate hai
 Emotional crying is very beneficial
 kaise? aaie jaanate hai-rone se aapkaa mood acha hota henetherlands main hui haal kii ek study main kuch logon ko sad movie dikhaai gai uske baad film dekhakar rone vaale or nahin rone waalon ko alag-alag baanta gaya
 Some people were not affected emotionally while some cried badly
 haalanki, 20 minute ke bheetar rone vaale log saamaanya avasthaa main aa gaye or 90 minute bitne ke baad rone vaale log, nahin rone vaale logon se zyada behatar mahasoos kar rahe the
 Crying reduces stress: William H
 Frey, director of the Alzheimer's Research Center Region's Hospital Foundation, also showed Sad Movies to participants
 wiliam ke mutabik, ham rone ke baad isliye acha mahasoos karte hai kyonki isse tanaav ke dauraan utpann hue chemicals baahar nikal jate hai
 We do not know what these chemicals are, but the tears contain ACTH which increases during stress
 fre ke mutabik, yah jaruri he ki ham kabhi-kabhaar roen
 This reduces stress and does not harm the heart and brain
 hamen apano bacchon ko rone se nahin rokna chahie
 We should be happy that they have this capability
 aansu se ankhen hoti hai surakshitbina bhavuk hue rone se bhi sehat ko phaayde hai
 When you cut the onion, a chemical comes out of the onion and reaches the surface of the eyes
 isse salphurik acid banataa he
 To get rid of it, tear glands remove the tears, which rinses the chemicals that reach the eyes
 aansuon main lisoxime bhi hota he jo antibacterial or anti viral hota he
 Glucose strengthens the surface cells of the eye
 aansu naak kii safai karte hanansu sharir ke bheetar ashru nalikaaon se hokar nasika tak pahunchate hai jisase naak main jamaa gandagi saaf ho jaati he
 This is the reason behind the runny nose when crying
 rone se naak main jamaa bacteria or gandagi baahar nikal jaati he
 According to Doctor Fr
, women average 5 a month
 3 baar roti hai jabaki purush ausatan 1
 Only cry 3 times
 is fark kii vajah yah he ki purushon main testaron hota he jabaki mahilaon main praulactin naamak hormone hota he jo rone ke liye prerit karata he
 According to Doctor Frey, tear glands also differ between men's and women's tear glands
 lekin purushon ke nahin rone kii sabase badi vajah langik or saanskrithik he, jo purushon ko rone ke phaaydon se vanchit karwaata he
 
 doctor orlof kehete hai, "rone ke bare main bhramon se baahar nikalnaa chahie
 Crying is good for health, and it is good for the health of both men and women

 dilli hoicourt ne nunatam mazdooree par somvaar ko ek or ahm aadesh jari kiya
 On Saturday, the court quashed the LG and Delhi government's decision to increase the minimum wage, but today the court has taken automatic cognizance that no factory owner or industry can demand the money back from the laborers
 iskaa matlab ye he ki dilli sarkaar ke nunatam mazdooree badhaane ke faisle ke baad jin mazdooron kii tankhwaah badha di gai thi unase ab tak kii badi hui tankhwaah ko koi bhi maalik vasuul nahin kar saktaa
 For the employees who were upset after the decision from the Delhi High Court on Saturday, this order from the High Court is a relief news
 bataa den ki shanivaar ko dilli hoicourt ne aadesh diya tha ki alji or dilli sarkaar ke nunatam mazdooree ko badhaane ke faisle ko radd kiya ja rahaa he kyonki is faisle main factory maalik yaa industries ko chalaane vaale logon kii raay nahin lee gai or sarkaar ne ek tarafa faisla lekar nunatam mazdooree ko badha diya
 In such a situation, it was feared that now the factory owners would ask for the money back from the increased salary from the employees, which they gave to their employees after the government's order, but the court has cleared this after taking cognizance today
 That the increased salary paid so far by the Delhi Government order to increase the minimum wage cannot be withdrawn from the employees
 bataa den ki march main dilli sarkaar ne nunatam mazdooree ko badhaane ke liye ek notification jari kiya tha jisamen dilli main akushal mazdooron ko 13,500 rupee, ardh kushal mazdooron ko 14,698 rupee or kushal mazdooron ko 16,198 rupee nunatam mazdooree tay kii gai thi
 But after the High Court's decision on Saturday, the minimum wage in Delhi at present will be reduced according to the old fixed salary
 iske mutabik ab akushal majdoor ko 9,724 rupee, ardh kushal mazdooron ko 10,764 rupee or kushal mazdooron ke liye 11,830 rupee pratimah he
 The cancellation of the minimum wage decision has been a major setback for the Delhi government
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki hoicourt se shanivaar ko aae faisle ke khilaaf sarkaar kya court main koi apil daakhil karegi
 However, the ban on recovery of old salary from Delhi High Court is a relief for the employees

 Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation, said on Saturday that the 'british lions' and the 'conqueror of communal poisoned snakes' in the country were more than 'chatur banias'
 gandhi philhal america main hai
 He said that today Mahatma's goal would have been different from BJP President Amit Shah
 shah ne kal raipur main ek sabha main mahatma gandhi ko 'chatur baniyaa' bataaya tha
 Gandhi, a biographer and research professor at the University of Illinois at the United States, said in an e-mail reply, "the man who won over British lions and communal poisoned snakes was more than a shrewd baniya
 amit shah jaise logon ke vipareet aaj unka lakshya nirdosh or kamjor logon kaa shikaar kar rahi shaktiyon ko parajeet karnaa hota
 Condemning Shah's statement as 'clever banias', opposition parties today demanded that they should apologize to the country
 saath hi vipakshi dalon ne is baat par jor diya ki apmanjanak bayaan ko waapas liya janaa chahie
 Gopalkrishna Gandhi, another grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, also said that Gandhi laughed off being called a 'clever baniya', but the remark was "badass and there is a false intention behind it"
 gauratlab he ki bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii jati ke sandarbh main unke liye ‘bahut chatur baniyaa’ shabd kaa ullekh kar rajnatik vivaad ko janm de diya he
 The Congress and other parties asked Shah to apologize for insulting the father of the nation
 haalanki, shaan ne maafee maangane se saaf inkaar diya he
 The comments shah ne raipur main kal prabud nagarikon ke ek samooh ko sambodhit karte hue, mahatma gandhi kaa jis baniyaa jati main janm hua tha uskaa ullekh kiya tha
 He had said, "mahatma Gandhi was a very 'clever baniya' besides being a visionary
 unhen maaloom tha ki aage kya hone vaala he
 He had said immediately after independence that the Congress should be dissolved
 yah kaam mahatma gandhi ne nahin kiya lekin ab kuch log congress ko bhang karne kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 "he said that Mahatma Gandhi had said this because the Congress was not founded on the basis of ideology
 yah ek tarah se aazaadee hasil karne ke liye ‘vishesh uddeshy upkram’ sareekha tha
 After facing criticism, Bharatiya Janata Party national president Amit Shah said that everyone knows in what context he said this
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) jeevanikar or america ke ilinoy vishvavidhyalay main shodh professor gandhi ne i-mail ke jariye bheje gaye jawaab main kaha, "jis vyakti ne british sheron or sampradayik jehar vaale sanpon par jeet hasil kii, vah chatur baniyaa se kahin adhik tha
 Unlike people like Amit Shah, his goal today would be to defeat the powers that have been hunting innocent and vulnerable people
 ’’ shah ke 'chatur baniyaa' vaale bayaan kii ninda karte hue vipakshi partiyon ne aaj maang kii ki unhen desh se maafee maangani chahie
 At the same time, the opposition parties insisted that the derogatory statement should be withdrawn
 mahatma gandhi ke ek anya pautra gopalkrishna gandhi ne bhi kaha ki gandhi 'chatur baniyaa' bataaye jane ko hans kar taal dete parantu yah tippanee ‘‘badmaja he or iske peeche chhipi galat manshaa' he
 Significantly, BJP President Amit Shah has given rise to political controversy by referring to the word 'very clever Baniya' for him in the context of Mahatma Gandhi's caste
 congress or anya dalon ne rashtrapita kaa apmaan karne ke liye shah ko maafee maangane ko kaha
 However, Shan has categorically refused to apologize
 tippaniyan Shah, while addressing a group of enlightened citizens in Raipur yesterday, mentioned the Baniya caste in which Mahatma Gandhi was born
 unhone kaha tha, "mahatma gandhi doordarshee hone ke saath hi bahut 'chatur baniyaa' the
 He knew what was going to happen next
 unhone aazaadee ke baad turant kaha tha ki congress ko bhang kar diya janaa chahie
 This work was not done by Mahatma Gandhi but now some people are working to dissolve the Congress
 " unhone kaha ki mahatma gandhi ne aisa isliye kaha tha kyonki congress kii sthapana vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par nahin hui thi
 It was like a 'special purpose undertaking' to achieve independence in a way
 aalochana kaa saamana karne ke baad bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya aghyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki sabhi jaanate hai ki unhone kis sandarbh main yah baat kahi he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Gopalkrishna Gandhi, another grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, also said that Gandhi laughed off being called a 'clever baniya', but the remark was "badass and there is a false intention behind it"

 sonia gandhi kaa kahana he ki agle saal aam chunaav main centre main sattarudh bhartiya janata party ke 'achche din' ke naare kii sthiti bhi 'shining india' jaisi ho jaaegi
 In 2004, the NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given the slogan of 'shining India' and with that it had won the general election at that time, but it lost a lot and formed the UPA government led by Manmohan Singh at the center
 tab sonia ke paas pradhanmantri banane kaa mauka tha, lekin unhone yah pad grahan karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 After 14 years, India Congress President Sonia Gandhi, who came to participate in India Today Conclave 2018, said that there will be many important issues in the elections in 2019

 In the name of Narendra Modi, the bjp's arrogance did not stop that Nitish Kumar, the oldest and loyal ally of NDA took out the sword
 unhone shairana andaaj main kaha, 'dua dete hai jeene kii, dawa dete hai marane kii
 On Thursday, Nitish's attitude was enough to tell that Modi will be the hero of BJP, but JDU will not accept him
 alam ye he ki endie tut kii kagaar par khadaa he, bas taarikh kaa elaan hona baaki he
 The danger is even greater because six ministers of the BJP camp in Bihar have stopped working

 That is why the party is now screaming that Modi is only the head of the campaign committee, the Prime Minister will announce the Parliamentary Board

 After rising inflation, the opposition tried to surround the Modi government in Parliament on the issue of Nripendra Mishra's appointment on Friday
 nripendra mishra ko niyamon main pherbadal kar adhyadesh ke jariye pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa pradhan sachiv niyukt kiya gaya he
 On Friday, the Modi government introduced the TRAI amendment bill in the Lok Sabha
 congress ne is bill kaa virodh nahin kiya
 But Trinamool Congress MP Swagat Roy vehemently opposed the bill
 unhone kaha ki pehali baar kisi afasar ke liye is tarah kaa bill laayaa ja rahaa he
 TRAI is an independent body and this amendment is being done for a retired officer who is the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister
 aisa karke tri kii swatantraaa se samjhauta kiya ja rahaa he
 In response, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that only the constitutionality of the bill can be questioned
 sarkaar ke paas tri main sanshodhan karne kaa puraa adhikaar he
 The opposition has no right to raise a finger on it
 nripendra mishra
 
 
 Narendra Modi's charioteer had served as the chairman of TRAI (telecom Regulatory Authority of India) between 2006 and 2009 and retired in 2009 itself
 aapako bataa den ki tri kanoon iske adhyakshon or sadasyon ko pad chhodane ke baad centre yaa rajya sarkaron main kisi anya pad par niyukti se pratibandhit karata he
 This provision of the law, which could have come in the way of appointing Mishra as Principal Secretary, was enacted by the Modi government for its amendment
 tri ke purv adhyaksh nripendra mishra 1967 batch ke ritred iees adhikari hai or uttar pradesh cader ke hai
 He was appointed Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister in May
 sarkaar ne us kanoon ko sanshodhan karne ke liye adhyadesh lagu kiya tha, jo mishra ko is mahatvapurn pad par niyukt karne se roak saktaa tha
 Mishra replaced Pulak Chatterjee, who was the Principal Secretary in the Prime Minister's Office when Manmohan Singh was Prime Minister
 69 varshiya mishra uttar pradesh ke hai or raajnneeti shaastra evam lok prashasan main snatakottar hai
 Trai, headed by Mishra, had recommended in August 2007 that spectrum should be auctioned

 Soon after the appointment, Congress Spokesperson Ajay Maken had questioned why the government adopted the ordinance route in this regard? He, however, also made it clear that the party is not pointing any fault in this officer and praises him as an honest and frank person
