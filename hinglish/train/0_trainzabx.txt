 apni pareshaani ke bare main media se baat karne kaa matlab he, dukaan lagane kii bachi-khuchi ummid par baaltee bhar pani daal dena
 Denying our attempt to talk, a young man who used to shop here till two weeks ago
 kahata he, ‘are nahin sahab, ham media se kya baat karen
 Media does not create work, it spoils
 agar kal ko ham thane par pradarshan karenge to media vaale hamen hi naksali bataa denge
 You go ham apana dekh lenge
 'most of the people who put up shop here are migrants from UP, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh who do not have degrees but have skills and courage
 inhone padhe-likhe berozegaar kii tarah kisi se naukari maangi nahin, balki apni dukaan par dusron ko kaam diya
 He was setting up shop here for years

 Somebody was saying in laughter-jokingly- Now, in front of the shop, get a board with 'under the Prime Minister's tea / pakoda / omelet scheme' modi ji ne anumati de di he
 They have described our work as employment
 lekin aaj jab unki dukaane band karvaa di gai hai, unka rojgaar unase chin liya gaya he, pet par pulisia laat lag chuki he to ye saare ke saare apane saath vyavastha ke is majaak ko samajhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 They are trying to understand how the policemen can close the shops which the PM of the country tells us as a means of employment
 sawaal ye bhi he ki kya inaki bechaini, dukh or pareshaani kii khabar bhi piem tak pahunch gai hogi jaise inke pakora talane kii jaankaree pahunch gai thi? Candidates can check their results by clicking on the direct link given below
 Calicut University Result Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has promised voters to waive house tax before the MCD elections
 lekin bijepi or congress donon hi aashwaasan ko dhakosla bataa rahe hai
 As a result, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia today confronted the media for clarifying this issue
 'logon kii takalif kaa khyaal'dipti-siem ne doharaaya ki dilli ke logon ko house tex jamaa karne main khaasi takalif ho rahi he
 He claimed that the government has made this announcement very thoughtfully and the common man is happy with this promise
 sisodiya ke mutabik abhi tak house tex ke naam par dallali kaa khel chal rahaa tha or house tex khatm hone se sabase zyada nuksaan dallalon kaa hi hoga
 'fulfilled promises' The Deputy Chief Minister reminded that his government has fulfilled the promises of reducing electricity and water prices
 saath hi privet skulon kii fees badhane nahin di gai he
 He said that in five years he will also fulfill the assurance of free wifi
 'virodhiyon kii aalochana galat'sisodiya ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi or congress bevajaah is vaayade par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 It seems they are not aware of the law
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ek jumala party he or use apane samarthak dallalon kii phikr kerani chahie
 The reaction of opposition parties was said to be impossible by BJP by Kejriwal's promise
 party ke pradeshdhyaksh manoj tiwari kaa kahana tha ki diemasi act ke mutabik house tex ko maaf nahin kiya ja saktaa
 For this, it will be necessary to change the law by a two-thirds majority in Parliament
 vahiin congress netaa ajay maakan ne ise mahaj jumala kahkar khaarij kiya tha
 What do you know? According to financial affairs expert Akash Jindal, waiving house tax will definitely provide relief to the common man
 lekin ghate se jujh rahi nagarpalika kii aarthik sehat is faisle se or kharaab ho sakati he
 Jindal believes that it will become more difficult for the MCD to provide basic amenities to people after the income from house tax is exhausted
 harakat main aae bagiis bich ravivaar ko aam aadmi party ke saikadon purv kaaryakarta dilli kii sadakon par utre
 He has launched a campaign against the government under the 'aap Bachao Abhiyan'
 in kaaryakartaaon kaa aarope tha ki emsidi chunaav main kaaryakartaaon ko nazarandaaj kar bahari logon ko tarjeeh di gai he
 Therefore, volunteers will stand for independent candidates in each ward

 Frustrated by the spot-fixing episode and other controversies related to the Indian Premier League, the breathtaking T20 league chairman Rajiv Shukla said on Wednesday that he was not willing to accept the post again
 shukla ne kaha ki unka kaarykaal shuruyaat main ek saal ke liye tha jiskaa prayek varsh navinikaran kiya janaa tha
 He, however, said that he is not keen to continue in this prestigious position for a third consecutive term

 "there has already been a discussion among the members of the BCCI and our concern right now is to protect the image of the BCCI and Indian cricket," he said
 ’’ shukla kaa is pad ko dobaaraa sweekaar nahin karnaa shrinivasana par atirikt dabaav bana saktaa he jinhone yah kehete hue apana pad chhodane se inkaar kar diya he ki unhone kuch bhi galat nahin kiya
 Shukla, who became the IPL chairman in place of Chirayu Amin last year, said the tournament was going well before the spot-fixing episode unfolded and now the most important thing is to maintain credibility
 unhone kaha, ‘‘kuch khilaadiyon or kuch logon kii galatiyon kii vajah se ipel main bhaag lene vaale saikadon khilaadiyon kaa naam kharaab nahin ho saktaa or nahin hona chahie
 Due to some greedy persons, the credibility of IPL cannot be discounted
 ’’ Asked what steps should be taken to maintain the credibility of the tournament, Shukla said, "the anti-corruption unit should work closely with police agencies

 He is not under the purview of the IPL chief and reports to the ICC and the BCCI
 ’’ Following this episode, the BCCI has formed a three-member committee to investigate the allegations against Gurunath Meiyappan, the son-in-law of board chief n Srinivasan and team principal of Chennai Super Kings

 Apart from Meiyappan, a three-member committee is investigating the spot-fixing allegations against three Rajasthan Royals players and the franchise

 The results of its investigation should not be referred to the BCCI Working Committee "

 Shukla said, "the post of IPL chief is for one year which is renewed every year at the annual general meeting but i have no desire to continue in this position for the third year

 Despite the controversies, the stadiums were packed
 ’’ The IPL chairman said, "I have never run after any position

 Shukla said that there was a lot of discussion among the board members over the continuation of n Srinivasan as BCCI president after the spot-fixing episode

 The second suggestion, which i have already accepted, is that an officer of the anti-corruption and Security Unit should be included with each team during the tournament as it will be able to identify a wrong player

 The final is that there should be a provision in the players' contract that if anyone is found involved in corruption, he should be criminally prosecuted

 said
 unhone kaha ki in muddon par sansad main keval charchaa se ve santusht nahin he

 Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj, while initiating the discussion on the Lokpal issue, said that history has given Parliament a historic opportunity to form the Lokpal and we should not miss this opportunity
 unhone kaha ki agar ham aaj yah mauka chuke to aane vaali peediyaan bhrashtachar se mukt nahin ho paaengi
 In order to free the Lokpal from government control, he suggested giving less importance to the government side and adopting a balanced path

 The second and last match of the two-match T20 series between Team India and Ireland will be played at the Malahide Cricket Club ground in Dublin from 8:30 pm on Friday night
 bharat ne buudhvaar ko khele gaye pehle match main ireland ko 76 ranon se haraa diya tha
 After which the Indian team will want to leave for England with a series win by defeating Ireland in the second T20 match
 pehle match main bharat ko kisi bhi tarah kii pareshaani nahin ai thi
 The pair of Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan provided a big score to Team India after which Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav did not give Ireland batsmen a chance to set foot on the wicket
 team indiatim india ireland ke khilaaf duusare or antim tii-20 match main bench strength ko aajmaana chaahegi taaki england ke khilaaf chunauteepurn daure ke liye sabhi ko pich kaa andaja ho jaae
 India chose Rohit and Dhawan as their first favorite choice of the opening pair for the first limited over leg of the tour
 isse pushti ho gai ki jab bhi mauka mila to rahul madhyakram main ballebaaji karenge or yah bahut jald agle match main bhi ha saktaa he
 Kohli's reaction does not seem to suggest whether India will make major changes in the bowling attack as well
 phir bhi aise kuch khilaadi hai jinhen baahar nahin bithaaya ja saktaa jaise rohit, dhawan or khud kohli, dhoni or do leg spinner
 India will benefit from the fact that the pitch of the second T20 match is expected to be the same as the T20
 kuldeep or chahal pich se laabh uthaane main safal rahe or ireland ke captain gairi wilson ne to yahaan tak kaha ki ve pehle gendbaaji karte yaa phir baad main, koi fark nahin padataa
 Kohli will surprise the opposition team in the next four T20 matches, while India can afford to take one batsman less to include an extra bowler in the team
 kohli kaa bench khilaadiyon ko aajamaane kaa mantra gendbaaji akraman main bhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen umesh yadav or siddharth kaul behatar karne ko betaab hai
 It can be seen clearly that the team management is not ready to take out Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jaspreet Bumrah
 vahiin kohli do gend khilne ke baad shunya par out ho gaye jisase vah bhi krij par kuch samay bitaana chahenge
 Although it is too early to worry about this, though it reminds him of his problems in 2014, in which he could not score runs
 team main badlaav kii baat chhod den to ballebaaji or gendbaaji kii majbootee dekhte hue bharat duusare match main prabal daavedaar hoga
 Fielding is a different matter and the coaching staff will expect Indian players to perform better than in the first T20
 kuldeep ne pichley match main chaar wicket liye the vahiin chahal ko teen safaltaaen mili thim
 In the second match too, this pair can prove to be a headache for the hosts
 irelandpahale match main ireland bharat kii barabari nahin kar pai or khel ke teen kshetron main kamjor sabit hui
 Ireland will have to raise their level of play
 gendbaaji or ballebaaji ke alaava team kii fielding bhi behad kharaab rahi thi
 In the batting, only James Shannon was able to stay on the wicket for Ireland
 unhone tej tarraar 35 gendon main 60 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 Apart from him, no other batsman could stand at the other end

 Ireland have to improve in three areas of the game if they have to match
 team india ne khele 100 tii-20, akele dhoni hi khel gaye 90 machapahale match main ireland ke liye 200 se zyada kaa score pahunch se kaaphi dur tha, unhone krij par datane kaa bharsak prayaas kiya lekin aisa nahi kar sake
 However, he can also be surprised on his land

 upree aadmi ke sivaa jalfareb gaanv kaa or koun kar saktaa he?pusht-pushtaini ke babu log chote logon ke tole main jate hai
 At the time of farming, people have to be cured at night, the workers should reach the fields one hour before the sun rises
 isliye sabhi bade kisaan shaam yaa raat ko hi apane-apane janon ko kah aate hai
 Ever since the arrival of the Khalasi in Neuraltoli, new things are being heard
 dekha-dekhi, duusare tole main bhi niyam-kanoon, panchayat or bandish ho gai he
 Poor Sahadeva Misar was tied up overnight by Tantrima people
 
 
 
 If he had entered Fulia's house, why did not Fula make a noise? The person who entered her house could not even sleep, the parents did not even get a sound and her dog did not stop
 gaanv ke logon ko betaar se khabar mil gai
 This is the bullying of the Khalaasi
 rahi haalat yahi to chote logon ke tole main jan ke liye janaa mushkil ho jayega
 Who knows, when and on whom will you get the lie? There should be a panchayat
 rajputon ne yadi is panchayat main brahmanon kaa paksh nahin liya to brahman log gwaalon ko rajput maan lenge
 "we don't know anything," Phulia says with folded hands between the panches
 'jab aangan main hallaa hone laga tab meri ankhen khuleen
 'sahadeva Misar has the tip of the thumbs of Mahgudas - on plain paper
 manhagu kii tik sahadev ke haath main he
 Sahadev can do whatever he wants
 donon gaayen or chaaron baache kal hi khunte se kholkar le jayega
 Apart from this, Sahadev has also run for a year
 ek aadmi kii mazdooree se to ek aadmi kaa bhi pet nahin bharta he
 
 
 
 lekin ab phulia ke haath main hi sahadev misar kii izzat or apane baap kii duniya he, uski boli main jaraa bhi her-pher hua ki sahadev kii izzat dhul main mil jaaegi or uske baap kii duniya bhi ujaad jaaegi
 Small and big people from all over the village have gathered in the panchayat
 tehseeldaar sahab pureniya gaye hai
 Singh is speaking alone in the panchayat
 kaali topivale sanyojak bhi hai
 Baldev ji is also there
 kaalicharan bina bulaae hi aayaa he

 acha, jab tumhaari neend khuli to tumne kya dekha?”“sahadev maalik ko aangan main gherkar sabhi hallaa kar rahe the
 "" Well, you sit down
 kaho, sahadev misar? ab aap bataaie ki manhagudaas ke yahan utani raat ko aap kyon gaye the?”“raat main hamaare pet main dard hua
 Came out with lota
 jab disa-maidan se ham laut rahe the to dekha ki kamala kinarevaale khet main kisi kaa bail gehun char rahaa he
 That is why he went to awaken Mehgu
 ““kyon?”“kamala kinarevaali jameen kaa paharaa karne ke liye manhagudaas ko hi diya he
 "well, then?" "while we were going, we caught Rabia and Sonma uprooting your farm

 As soon as we were leaving the courtyard, Rabita, Sonma, Tetra and Naqshedia caught us and started making fun
 “"kya bataaen, hamaara paanch bigha sakarkand inhen saalon ne churaakar khatam kar diya
 
 
 
 acha, aap baith jaaie
 
 
 
 kahan he mahangu?”“ji sarkaar,” manhagu boodha haath jodakar khadaa hota he
 "sahadev Misar had woken you up?" "yes Government!" "now the five people decide what is the real thing
 “kaalicharan kaise chup rah saktaa he! panchayat main ekatarfa baat nahin honi chahie
 Rabia and Sonam are members of the party
 yah to panchayat nahin, munhadekhi he
 How can Kalicharan be silent- "singh, let us ask you something too
" “panchayat ke sabhi panchon kii nigahen achaanak kaalicharan kii ore mud gai
 Singh turned red with anger
 lekin panchayat main gussa nahin hona chahie
 The youth of Rajputtoli began to whisper among themselves
 sanyojak ji ne packet tatolkar dekh liya- siti laana bhul to nahin gaye hai? jotakhi ji etraj karte hai –“kaalicharan ko ham log panch nahin maanate
 "" First, it is decided that how many people of Panchayat consider us as Panch and how many people do not
 “ ek aadmi ke chaahane or na chaahane se kya hota!
 
 
 Okay, punch God! Do we not have the right to sit, speak and give opinions in this panchayat? Are we not residents of this village? ”
 
 
 kaalicharan khadaa hokar kahata he, “ yadi aap log hamako panch maanate hai to haath uthaaie

 Through this rally, Akhilesh and Mayawati will not only challenge PM Narendra Modi in their own parliamentary constituency, but the entire Purvanchal will also try to make a big impact of this rally
 haalanki bijepi ke garh main modi ko gathbandhan kii yah chunauti pratikatmak hi najar aegi kyonki ek to sapa or basapa kabhi bhi banaras main majboot sthiti main nahin rahe duusare sapa ne jo pratyaashee utaara he wo bhi modi ke kad ke aage behad kamjor he
 However, to make this fight interesting, the SP had bet on the BSF sacked soldier Tej Bahadur on the last day of nomination
 yah daanv kuch sateek bhi lag rahaa tha lekin sapa ke tarkash se ye tir nikal paata uske pehle hi chunaav ayog ne ise tarkash main hi band kar diya
 The last three days from May 16, PM Modi is also reported to have jumped into this battle of Benares
 khabar he ki 16 taarikh ko chandauli main piem kii sabha he uske baad ve raatri vishram yaheen kar sakate hai
 On May 17 morning, he can visit the temples
 charchaa to ye bhi he ki ve pehali baar banaras main door tu door campan bhi kar sakate hai or poling ke din bhi ve yaheen rah sakate hai
 Nobody should be surprised in this because PM Modi has been startling before his fresh new way of campaigning
 iske saath hi bijepi ke sabhi mantri se lekar bade netaa tak banaras ke chunavi maidan main in dinon utar pade hai or ve apane-apane tareeke se is ladaai main bhagidaari kar rahe hai
 Obviously, when the competition will be so interesting, how can the media lag behind
 is puure battle ko apane camaron main kaid karne ke liye desh hi nahin balki videshon ke bhi jarnlist in dinon banaras main deraa daale hue hai or is ladaai ko apane-apane chashme se dekh rahe hai
 It is clear that all these seats of the last phase of Purvanchal were in the bjp's seat in 2014, in such a situation, once again, where the BJP will push its heel to the top, the SP-BSP and the Congress will make a dent in it
 All the strength is pouring in

 ) Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi gave a strange statement on Friday
 unhone kaha tha ki agar chikitsa main garibon ke saath khilwaad hua to ve haath kaat denge
 Manjhi, while clarifying a day after this statement, said on Saturday that he had given such a statement as an idiom
 mukhyamantri maanjhi ne patna main apane bayaan par safai dete hue kaha, 'unhen hindi ke muhaavarey kaa gyaan hona chahie, jo unke bayaan par hangaamaa machaa rahe hai
 'he said that' cutting off of hands' means abolishing his right, not his actual cutting of hands
 bayaan ko sahi dhang se samajhane kii baat he
 He said about the idiom that 'cut off the hand', 'shorten the height', means to reduce the right
 unhone aage kaha ki rajya main 90 pratishat chikitsak to thik kaam karte hai, jinke prati sammaan he, parantu 10 pratishat chikitsak kaary ke prati laaparvaah hai
 Significantly, the Chief Minister, while addressing a public meeting in Motihari, Bihar on Friday, said, "if a poor is ill, people are troubled by him
 pehle use ojha tang karte hai or jab vah aspataal pahunchataa he to use vahaan pareshaan kiya jaataa he
 ' unhone aise logon ko chetavanee dete hue kaha, 'aise logon ko ghar baitha diya jayega
 If there was a disturbance in Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), then many people know how many people sat at home
 agar garibon ke saath khilwaad hua to vah haath kaat denge
 For this, no matter how much will be on Manjhi, he will bear it
 ' unhone kaha ki ve garib parivaar se aate hai or garib ke saath khilwaad nahin hone denge

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani said on Monday that Lord Ram has a special place in his life and he dreams of a Ram Rajya with a Ram temple in the country
 adwani ne nai dilli main ek pustak locarpan samaaroh ke dauraan kaha ‘‘swatantraaa ke baad se mere lambe raajnneetik jivan main agar kisi kaa vishesh sthaan rahaa he to vah bhagwan ram hai
 "he said" Even i completed two visits in his name
 isamen ek somnath se yodhya tak kii thi jabaki duusari sushasan or swaarajya ke liye thi
 Advani said that the party's commitment to the Ram temple can be understood from the fact that it spoke of the construction of the Ram temple as a 'national temple'
 unhone mahatma gandhi ke sapanom kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ‘‘jab kisi ne mahatma gandhi se poocha ki swaraj kaa kya arth he, jab unhone kaha tha, iskaa arth ram rajya he

 beete kai hafton se desh main pyaaj, tamaato, anda, tel or rifind oil jaise jaruri khaadya utpaadon kii keemat main lagaataar ijapha dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 The central government has been claiming for some products that the increase is due to the monsoon move or the distortion in demand-supply
 haalanki mana ja rahaa he ki desh main mahangaai dastak dene ke liye taiyaar he or ye ijaphe mahaj ek sanket hai
 The government is also able to do with these signals and is constantly trying to maintain balance in the demand and supply of essential food products in the country
 gauratlab he ki 1 july 2017 se desh main jiesti (guds and services tex) lagu hone ke baad aarthik jaankaron ne ashanka jaahir kii thi ki bhartiya arthvyavastha ke saamne mahangaai kii gambhir chunauti khadi ho sakati he
 Due to this challenge, the pace of development in the country may come with a setback as well as a mass unemployment crisis
 kahin phir na bahen pyaaj ke aansu:beete maheene se pyaaj kii keemten ek baar phir saikadaa paar karne kii ore agrasar hai
 Currently, onion is being sold at Rs 80 per kg in the retail market
 kendra sarkaar kii daleel he ki keemton main yah ijapha monsoon main disterbence kii ummid par pyaaj kii buaai ke ghate rakabe ke kaaran ho rahi he
 At the same time, agricultural scientists also say that the kharif onion yield will also be low due to the fall in sowing area
 haalanki hakeekat yah bhi he ki monsoon or kheti ke is alert ke baavjood june se sitambar tak desh se badi maatra main cold storage main rakhi pyaaj kii rabi fasal ko emport kar diya gaya
 Also read: Prices of skyrocketing eggs, 15% increase in wholesale prices, due to this import, demand-supply disturbed in the market
 baharhaal, ab pyaaj kii keemton par sthiti bekaabu na ho jaae, kendra sarkaar ne pyaaj ke export par pabandi lagane kaa faisla kar liya he
 According to this decision, after 2015, once again, onion exports from the country will have to pay huge minimum export tax
 minimum export price nirdhaarit karne se utpaada ko tay keemat se kam par videsh bhejne par pabandi lag jaati he
 Although the Central Government has not yet fixed the rate of minimum export price after this decision, sources claim that the rate of $ 700-800 per tonne can be announced soon
 ise bhi padhe: khatm hui crude oil keemton kii aitihaasik raahat, ab dastak degi mahangaai!rasoyee se gaayab na ho jaae tel or rifind:vanaspati milon kii liwali badhane se rashtriya rajdhani dilli ke thok tel tilhan bazaar main majbootee kaa rukh dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 During this period, edible oil prices have registered a strength of up to Rs 200 per quintal due to heavy buying by vegetable mills
 upabhokta udyogon kaa uthaav badhane se akhaadya tel khand main arandi tel kii keemat main bhi teji rahi
 Market sources said that heavy buying by vegetable mills on the back of increased demand mainly led to rise in edible oil prices
 vahiin beete saptaah kendra sarkaar ne soyabean tel ke aayaat shulk ko 12
 5 percent to 30 percent, Soybean refined oil increased from 15 percent to 35 percent, crude palm oil increased from 15 percent to 30 percent, RBD palm oil increased from 25 percent to 40 percent, sunflower crude oil increased from 15 percent to 35 percent have make
 aayaat shulk main is ijaphe ke sidhe asar se desh main rifind or tel kii keemton main ijapha darj hota he
 However, the Central Government has taken this decision in the interest of farmers
 desh main tilhan kii nai fasal taiyaar he or sarkaar ne yah ijapha is hawaale se kiya he jisase kisaanon ko mahange videshi utpaada ke chalate fasal ke liye acchhee keemat mil sake
 However, it is certain that by the time the domestic product reaches the market, the increased import duty will keep the inflation of oil and refined
 gauratlab he ki desh main tel or rifind kii kul maang kaa mahaj 30 fisadi gharelu utpaada se puraa hota he
 At the same time, 70 percent of domestic demand is met through imports
 ise bhi padhe:aarthik surveykshan: GDP ko notebandi, crude oil kii keemton se sabase bada khatraayun hi murgi se mahangaa hua anda?thand abhi thik se shuru bhi nahin hui ki andey ke daam aasmaan chune lage hai

 This means egg 6 in retail

 The price is getting 5 rupees
 bataa den ki pichley chah maheenon main pune main 100 andon kii cret kii keemton main bada oochaal aayaa he, jo 375 rupee se badhkar 585 rupee tak pahunch gai he
 An egg product manufacturer based in Erode, Tamil Nadu reported that egg prices generally increase due to winter demand, while broiler rates decrease as supply increases
 lekin andey kii keemton main itani badhotaree kabhi nahin dekhne ko mili
 The Reserve Bank is upset over the widening gap between retail and wholesale inflation
 The Reserve Bank said that the major reason for rising inflation during FY 2015-16 was the large gap between retail inflation (CPI) and wholesale inflation (wpi)
this growing gap khudara or thok manhagaai ke bich badhate is antar se niti nirmaataaon or arthshaastriyon main is baat ko lekar bahes chhidi kii is antar kaa kendriya bank kii mudra niti par kya asar padegaa
 However, the Reserve Bank made this calculation mainly in the context of rising inflation during the financial year 2015-16
 lekin khaas baat yah he ki desh main 1 july se jiesti lagu hone ke baad ek baar phir khudara or thok mahangaai ke bich antar lagaataar bad rahaa he
 It is worth noting that while retail inflation measures inflation based on rising prices of food and other products mainly in the country, wholesale inflation measures inflation in the prices of products globally
 assam ke purv mukhyamantri prafull mahant, unke putr or do anya log mangalvaar raat us samay ghayal ho gaye jab kafile main chal rahi unki car ek khadey hue trek se takaraa gai

 The car also had Dinesh Kumar of NSG and driver Birendra Singh

 Police said Mahant has suffered injuries on both legs and face and his condition was stated to be out of danger
 input- bhashaa Just before the match against Perth in the Perth, Virat Kohli himself raised a controversy, due to which he is under criticism
 unhone ek abhyaas satr ke dauraan ek bhartiya khel patrkaar ke saath abhadrata kii
 He used profanity and that too when he was not angry with the sports journalist
 wo galati se unhen koi doosraa patrkaar samaj baithe the, jinase unako naaraajaagi thi
 Such an attitude of Kohli should be criticized and it is being done
 aakhirkaar, bhartiya cricket unhen bhavishya ke captain ke taur par dekh rahaa he, unke har chakke or chaukke par media unki tarifon ke pul baandh detaa he
 In such a situation, Kohli's attitude in public suggests that he lacks maturity
 bhartiya cricket board ne fatkaar sunai he or unhen team kii garima kaa dhyaan rakhane ko kaha he
 Kohli sometimes confronts Gautam Gambhir in an IPL match and sometimes gets entangled with the opposition team's player David Warner
 kai baar lagata he ki ye kohli kii fiting spirit he jiske chalate wo maidan par jab khunta gaad dete hai to vipakshi team ke hausalon ko post hote der nahin lagati
 But if Kohli has to dominate cricket's sky for the long term, he will have to improve his behavior
 isi vaakya main khel patrkaar ke paas jaakar apni galati ke liye khed jataakar ve maamle ko khatm kar sakate the, lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 Former cricketers Sunil Gavaskar and VVS Laxman have also admitted that Virat Kohli should have ended the matter with regret
 kehete hai ki insaan apni galatiyon se sabak letaa he
 Hopefully, Kohli will also take lessons
 baharhaal, in aalochanaon ke bich main perth kaa muqaabala kohli ke liye ek bada mauka hoga
 If they manage to win the team vigorously with their batting, then the same Indian media will leave behind Kohli's behavior and will also read his praises
 kohli agar team india kii jeet main ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaate hai to team india kaa prabandhan unhen press conference bhi bhej saktaa he or vahaan ve saarvajanik taur par mediakarmiyon se khed jataa sakate hai
 Virat Kohli has not been able to score a century on Perth's ground so far, he will also have a chance to complete this challenge
 kehane kii jarurat nahin he bharat or westeindies kaa muqaabala holi ke din khelaa ja rahaa he, kohli ke saamne media or khel prashansakon ko apane hi rang main rangane kaa mauka he
 Where we can say you don't mind is 'kohli'

 By collaborating with AIIMS, the Tihar administration has been trying to curb violence by inmates inside the jail for the past 1 year
 ab vah hinsa, aatmahatya yaa phir hatya kisi bhi rup main ho sakati he
 Actually, through this support program, Tihar Jails try to get the mental tension of the prisoners by counseling them, so that they do not commit any kind of violent activity

 With this, the Tihar administration has been able to curb cases like violence from 30 to 35% through this support program

 All these compulsions and helplessness are just for the public

 There is an open exemption for leaders

 Use any language
 kisi ke kapade par kuch bhi coment karen
 Threaten to kill someone
 ali-bajrang ali ke naam par desh ko baant den
 Everything will work kyonki ye hamaare netaa hai
 The country runs through them only
 yahi to desh kaa kanoon banaate hai
 It is in their hands that the law is rung
 danda naa bhi ho to kanoon ke muhafiz inhen ke hi ishaare par to danda ghumaate hai

 The Allahabad High Court acquitted his father Rajesh Talwar and mother Nupur, accused in the Aarushi murder case after about 9 years and 5 months
 is diwali par talwaar danpati ko ek badi saugat mili he
 It can be said that after years, in Diwali house number D-5, this year Diwali lamps will be lit
 kai saal ke lambey intjaar ke baad talwaar danpati ko raahat mili he
 On Friday morning, he had breakfast in jail
 naashte main un donon ne puri or aalu kii sabji khai
 Both did not sleep properly due to happiness last night
 jail sutron ke mutabik donon apni-apni barrack main chahal kadami karte najar aae
 The Talwar couple has not rested since Aarushi's murder in May 2008
 pehle police is dabl murder cese ko ghumaati rahi or phir rahi sahi kasar sibiai ne puri kar di
 The Talwars were sentenced to life imprisonment by the CBI court of Ghaziabad on 26 November 2013 after a long hearing on the case
 jiske baad ke talwaar danpati ne sibiai court ke faisle ke khilaaf elahabaad hoicourt main apil kii thi
 Earlier in 2012, four years after the double murder, Aarushi's mother Nupur Talwar had to surrender in court and then go to jail
 26 november 2013 ko sibiai court kaa faisla aayaa to sibiai ke vishesh nyaayadhish es
 Lal, in his 208-page judgment, convicted the accused Rajesh and Nupur Talwar
 yahaan se puraa maamla hi badal gaya
 But despite all this, the Talwar couple did not give up
 janvari 2014 main aarushi ke pita rajesh or maa noopur talwaar ne sibiai court ke faisle ko elahabaad hoicourt main chunauti di
 The hearing went on for three years
 agast 2017 main elahabaad hoicourt ne kaha ki talwaar danpati kii apil ko dobaaraa sunenge
 Then the Allahabad High Court reserved the verdict in the Aarushi murder case in September 2017 i
e
 last month after hearing the case
 or ab guuruuvaar yani 12 oktober 2017 ko hai court ne talkh tippanee ke baad aarushi-hemraj murder cese main rajesh talwaar or noopur talwaar ko hatya ke aarope se bari kar diya
 Allahabad High Court has said that the Kittalwar couple did not kill Aarushi
 isliye donon ko reeha kar diya jaae
 But will this release erase the grief and wounds of the last nine years? Will the parents, who are living on the head of their own daughter's murder, be overcome by this shock? The question is not about the four-five-year imprisonment that the Talwar couple had spent in jail
 ye to koi sazaa nahin thi
 In front of that punishment, the Talwars, who have suffered the burden of killing their own daughter, will not be able to live long
 raajnneeti main kai baar betuki magar sukhad si lagane vaali vidambnaaen ban jaati hai
 Like the Congress has its national headquarters on Akbar Road in New Delhi and the BJP on Ashok Road
 akbar or ashok donon hi bhartiya itihaas ke mahanatam nayakon main se hai or congress bijepi donon ne baari-baari se bharat par shashan kiya he
 The Pandit path on which the office of Delhi Pradesh BJP is based is in the name of the Congress leader Govind Ballabh Pant of the Gandhian era
 pradesh kaa congress kaa daftar us pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay maarg par he jo bijepi ke vichaar pratik maane jate hai
 It was in this office that Congress President Arvinder Singh arrived to meet Lovely today
 prime time main arvind kejariwal or satish upaadhyaay ke baad congress netaa ke intervyuu kii baari thi
 The 48-year-old Lovely stepped out of the office in a jolt and set out on the platform of the Tilak Bridge, before the New Delhi station
 congress daftar ke peeche padataa he yah stesan
 The Congress is struggling for a comeback after winning three consecutive terms in Delhi
 itihaas to yahi rahaa he ki jahaan bhi congress tisare number par pahunchi he or bees pratishat se kam uskaa mat pratishat rahaa he vahaan waapas nahin aa saki he
 Even after this, Lovely seems excited that this time he will fight both AAP and BJP
 congress daftar main pasri udaasi unke chehre par utsaah main badal gai
 Started confronting every question
 aap or bijepi ke khilaaf naaron kii shakl main baat karne lage
 After the Lok Sabha elections, the aggression of the Congress leaders has gone, but somehow the rest appeared in Lovely
 lavali ne saaf kaha ki unki ladaai bijepi se hai
 They have made this political line that AAP is B-team of BJP
 jo bhi aap se nikalataa he wo bijepi main hi kyon jaataa he
 Why did everyone go from Kiran Bedi to VK Singh and Shazia Ilmi in BJP? jab maine poocha ki aap sajjan kumaar or jagadish titalar ke bare main kya sochate hai to tad se jawaab diya ki jab jab hamen lagata he ki ve adalati karrwai ke ghere main aate hai ham unka tikat kaat dete hai, lekin wo kabhi jail nahin gaye
 Why does the media not ask BJP that their national president is also accused, how did they become national president
 media yah sawaal karne kii himmat hi nahin karegaa
 Lovely clearly said that if the BJP goes to the polls on the face of Narendra Modi, then we will target Narendra Modi
 ham unhen expos karenge
 We do not have a lack of arguments against him
 shila dikshit ke bare main lavali ne chaturaai se jawaab diya
 Said that the party will decide, but Sheela has never been the face of Congress
 kabhi congress ne unhen mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar chunaav nahin ladaa
 But he is our respected leader and we would like him to campaign for the Congress
 congress ke aam pravaktaa jis tarah se kamazor nazar aate hai uske mukaable lavali kahin zyada aakraamak hai
 His attack has a sharp edge as well as a fighting element
 kehete rahe ki ek chunaav se sari vyakhyaayein kaise badal sakati hai
 Earlier, how did this media praise Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh
 2009 main jab ham jite the to sab kehete the ki shaharon main voter hamen pasand karte hai
 Urban voters have rejected BJP
 main lavali se baar baar kahata rahaa ki koi bhi jaankaar yaa sameekshak congress kii vaapasi kii sambhaavnaaon ke bare main nahin sochataa
 Lovely kept saying that it doesn't matter
 jab vipaksh main rahane kaa aadesh mila he to sar jhukaakar seva karenge lekin ham ladenge or vaapasi karenge
 We will come back in this election
 thik he ki hamaare paas paise kam hai lekin is baar ham prachaar bhi tagada karenge
 After this, Lovely stresses that from where did the BJP that calls us a corrupt party come from, and we have no money
 lavali arvind or satish upaadhyaay ye teenon dilli ke ziddee netaa hai
 All three do not pressurize anyone in conversation
 sawaalon se bhid jate hai
 While walking, when we finally asked about the Lieutenant Governor, Lovely could not stop himself
 kahaan ki najeeb jang ne apana sanvaidhanik daayitv nahin nibhaayaa
 i asked why you gave the position to a person who did not trust ideological loyalty
 har netaa sawaalon ko apane hisaab se kheltaa he
 Like a cricketer
 lavali ne kaha ki aapane bijepi adhyaksh kaa intervyuu kiya
 We were going to ask you whether you went to Pandit Pant Marg or Rajivas for an interview
 rajanivas up rajyapal kaa nivas he
 Lovely's target was clear that Najeeb Jung has now become a BJP leader from Congress
 dilli kaa chunaav zamin par kaaphi rochak hone ja rahaa he
 The BJP will die to prove Modi's popularity
 aam aadmi party apana astitv bachaane ke liye sabakuch lutaa degi
 After defeating the Congress in two elections, the Congress will give all its strength to lift the head
 dekhte hai nateeja kya hota he
 As i often say
 chunaav kaa mazaa survey se nattejey ko jaan lene main nahin balki aakhri seen se pehle puri film dekhne main he
 The film has started
 aap aaraam se dekhte chaliye
 The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has removed the vacancy
 icchhuk ummidavaar 09 july tak aavedan kar sakate hai

 team india kii majboot kadi viraat kohli or bollywood actress anoushka sharma ke lav afares kii kai kahaniyaan to aapane bhi suni hongi
 Must have also seen pictures of both of them being in the same apartment together and walking around in New Zealand
 lekin achaanak aisa kya ho gaya ki viraat kohli anoushka se haath chhudaakar eliana di-krooj kii bahon main dikh rahe hai
 Recently you must have seen how Virat rejected all the girls shown by Shahrukh Khan and then he did not like any picture shown by him, but he agreed to Anushka's picture

 After completing the shooting of the film 'bombay Velvet', Anushka is going to be busy shooting for her home production film NH10

 Although the shampoo brand waited for Anushka till the last time that she could get some time out for this advertisement, but it did not happen
 phir bhi mana ja rahaa he ki yah ek baar ke liye kiya gaya edjastment he or jab tak unka contract khatm nahin hota anoushka brands kaa hissaa bani rahengi
 Until Anushka returns, Virat Kohli will be seen alongside Ileana d-cruise in this shampoo advertisement

 The syllabus is of commerce, taxation
 akhabaaron main jiesti ko lekar alag-alag sector kii pareshaaniyon kii khabaren bhi chap rahi hai, lekin in sabko choti-moti dikkatein bataate hue sarkaar apni tay kii hui manzil par pahunch chuki he
 The GST regime is coming into effect from 1 July
 sarkaar ke liye yah mauka itnaa bada he ki wo ise azaadi ke landmark kii tarah pesh karnaa chaahati he, kapadaa vyapaariyon ko chhod baaki adhiktar vyapaarik sanghathan aapattiyon ko andolan se bachaate hue zaahir kar rahe hai
 Therefore it is difficult to understand and claim that their problem is justified and big
 jab bataane vaala hi saahas nahin dikhaayegaa to kya kiya ja saktaa he
 One thing to be noted is that GST is a reality and it is also a fact that it is not fair to expect anchors like us to have the simple ability to present the specifics of GST
 koshish kii magar kam samaj paaya
 But if i did not do the program on GST today, my name would not be recorded in the footnote of history
 hedline kii jagah to pehle se hi chhek lee gai he
 Thankfully, Sudhir Hallakhandi, a chartered accountant living in Beawar, Ajmer, has written a book in Hindi on GST
 aaj hi unke bare main pataa chalaa or unki anumati se hindi main likhi unki kitaab ke ansh kaa ham istamaal bhi karenge
 Happy GST to all of you
 sudhir halaakhandee kaa daawa he ki inhone jiesti kii 100 se adhik shabdaawaliyon ko hindi main samajhaayaa he
 GST means Goods and Services Tax

 This book is available in the e-book
 sudhir ne likhaa he ki ise koi bhi chhap kar share kar saktaa he basharte vah kitaab kii keemat nahin vasulegaa, unka naam chhaapega or lekhak ko uski do prati bhejega
 Sudhir ji thought so much for Hindi, we are grateful to him

 sarkaar jo kaam lakhon-karodon kharch kar kar rahi he, vahi kaam aap apni taraf se free main kar rahe hai
 GST is being explained to the general public in the frame of cheap expensive
 bharat kaa media bajet ke saath bhi yahi karata he or bajet main darj nitigat chaalaakiyaan yaa khubiyaan janata tak nahin pahunch paati hai
 There are two types of GST, one is the state GST, which will be deposited in the state account, the other is the center GST which will be deposited in the account of the center
 maan lijie jaipur ke vyapaaree ramesh chand usee shahar ke dealer suresh chand ko 10 lakh main apana maal bechate hai
 Suppose 9% state and 9% center is GST
 is hisaab se ramesh 90,000 tex state jiesti ke rup main le lete hai or 90,000 centre jiesti ke rup main
 Ramesh deposits these money in both treasures
 ab suresh ji is maal ko jodhpur ke mahesh chand ko 10
 50 lakhs
 jo jisko bechega wo usase jiesti vasulegaa
 So Suresh ji collects 94,500 state GST and 94,500 center GST from Mahesh ji
 ab sawaal aata he ki kya suresh ji bhi 94,500 rupee state jiesti main jamaa karenge
 The answer is no
 chunki suresh ji 90,000 state or 90,000 centre jiesti ke rup main ramesh ji ko de chuke hai, isliye ye paisa wo pehle di gai jiesti se gata denge
 That means 90,000 out of 94,500 at both places
 is tarah se ve 4500 rupee state jiesti ke khate main jamaa karenge or itnaa hi centre jiesti ke khate main jamaa karenge
 Hopefully my school's math teacher will not be watching 'prime time' today, or else he may be shocked how the boy who was a math loser is explaining the subtraction to the country on TV
 unke liye bataa duun ki maine sudhir ji kii kitaab tip lee he, apana koi dimaag nahin lagaaya he
 The old taxes will be abolished with GST, but when moving goods from one state to another, one has to go through a new system called Integrated Goods and Service Tax
 is dauraan road permit tex bhi dena hota he, jo abhi nahin hataa he
 Suresh Hhalakhandi believes that road permit tax will have to be paid
 to kya yah jiesti ke atirikt kar he
 If so, then how is GST a tax? integrated jiesti koi nayaa kar nahin he balki nayaa tantra he
 Through this, the trade between the two states will be monitored
 kaha ja rahaa he ki isse prakriyaayein thodi jatil ho jaaengi
 How complicated it would be when i started reading it
 phir chhod diya baaki aap jo vigyapanon main chapa he use dekhakar samaj len
 Although Suresh ji has explained it in a very simple way, but due to timeliness and vigor on TV, we are leaving him
 itihaas ban rahaa he to thodi mehnat aap bhi kiijie
 Now come to the return
 har maheene teen ritern bharne honge jo ek-duusare se alag honge
 GSTR-1 will be the details of the monthly sales which have to be submitted by the 10th of the next month
 GSTR-2 masik kharid kaa vivaran hoga jo agle maah kii 15 taarikh tak jamaa karnaa hoga
 Can't submit before 10 date because you have to submit the details of the sale till ten, so you will have to submit the details of the purchase only after the 15th
 GSTR-3 ye masik kar kaa ritern he jo agle maah kii 20 taarikh tak jamaa karne honge
 GSTR-9 is the annual return which has to be submitted by 31 December after the end of the financial year
 is prakaar puure saal main 37 ritern bharne honge
 The GSTN network created by the government will have to be returned
 aap pehle bhi waite vagairah online hi bhar rahe the
 Sudhir Hhalakhandi has written that it will have to work very hard to follow the provisions related to it, but also to adhere to the difficult time limit because till the first seller returns, the buyer will not be able to fill his returns
 aisa hote hi puri chen main brake aa jayega or system ko pataa chal jayega
 Only two months have been given to correct this gap
 agar pehle dealer ne ritern nahin bharaa, dukaan band kar gaayab ho gaya to jo jiesti aapane use di he, utani hi rakam aap dobaaraa bharenge
 If the idea of the former changed and filled it, you will get that amount back
 ab aap kahenge ki hamen kaise maaloom ki jisase maal kharid rahe hai wo dealer bharosemand he
 So for this, the rating of dealers will be given on the site of GST
 har vyapaaree duusare vyapaaree kii reating dekh sakegaa jo jiestn kii site par hogi
 Now come to the bill
 1 july ko aap apni dukaan par jate hai
 If you sell goods to the customer then how to deduct the first GST bill
 jiesti ke tahat aap computer ke alaava apni bill book bhi chhapava sakate hai
 Suppose you are a cloth merchant
 shanivaar ko aapaki dukaan par koi graahak pahunchataa he or 100 shart kharidta he to bill kaise banaayenge
 You should have a total of 15 types of information
 vikreta or karidaar kaa naam, pataa or jiestn number zarur hona chahie
 The date of issue of the bill should also be its serial number
 maal kaa vivaran, maatra or kul keemat aapako darj karnaa hoga
 Dealer signatures are mandatory
 har bill kii teen prati hogi
 One you will keep, the other with the buyer and the third for the transporter
 ise aapako chhapava kar rakh lenaa chahie
 The comments chhapavane kii laagat har vyapaaree ko khud uthaani padegi
 There is also a provision of punishment under GST
 kya jiesti ke tahat giraftaar ke praavdhaan hai
 Is it a little silly that will lead you to jail, is it a doubt or is it really so
 ye bhi jaanane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Suresh ji has written in Hindi that under Section 69 of GST, provisions for arrest have been given
 agar kisi ne 132 ke tahat aparaadh kiya he to giraftaar ho saktaa he
 The CGST officer will make the arrest and the order will be that of the commissioner
 kuch aparaadh gair jamaanti hai or kuch jamaanti
 Arrests will not be held without the order of the Commissioner
 bina bill kaa maal supplai karenge, kar chori ke iraade se
 One can go to jail for issuing a bill without GST
 jiesti lekar teen maheene tak jamaa nahin karne par jail jaaenge
 If there is theft of more than 2 crores then the provisions of arrest apply
 yani 2 karod se kam kii kar chori par jail jane se batch sakate hai
 The medium and small range dealer need not fear
 magar aap do baar jiesti kaa ulanghan karte hai to jail ja sakate hai
 Then it will not be seen whether there is a charge of tax evasion of 2 crores
 0 pratishat, 5 pratishat, 12 pratishat, 18 pratishat or 28 pratishat tex hai jiesti ke tahat
 If essential commodities are kept out of GST, then there are many things that will come under the tax ambit for the first time

 Now come to the bill
 1 july ko aap apni dukaan par jate hai
 If you sell goods to the customer then how to deduct the first GST bill
 jiesti ke tahat aap computer ke alaava apni bill book bhi chhapava sakate hai
 Suppose you are a cloth merchant
 shanivaar ko aapaki dukaan par koi graahak pahunchataa he or 100 shart kharidta he to bill kaise banaayenge

 One can go to jail for issuing a bill without GST
 jiesti lekar teen maheene tak jamaa nahin karne par jail jaaenge
 If there is theft of more than 2 crores then the provisions of arrest apply
 yani 2 karod se kam kii kar chori par jail jane se batch sakate hai
 The medium and small range dealer need not fear
 magar aap do baar jiesti kaa ulanghan karte hai to jail ja sakate hai
 Then it will not be seen whether there is a charge of tax evasion of 2 crores
 0 pratishat, 5 pratishat, 12 pratishat, 18 pratishat or 28 pratishat tex hai jiesti ke tahat
 If essential commodities are kept out of GST, then there are many things that will come under the tax ambit for the first time
 aam janata ko jiesti ke bare main sasta mahangaa ke frem main samajhaayaa ja rahaa he
 India's media does the same with the budget and the policy tricks or merits recorded in the budget do not reach the public
 do tarah kii jiesti he, ek state jiesti, jo rajya ke khate main jamaa hogi, doosraa centre jiesti jo centre ke khate main jamaa hogi
 Suppose Ramesh Chand, a merchant from Jaipur, sells his goods to Suresh Chand, a dealer in the same city, for 10 lakhs
 maan lijie 9 fisadi state or 9 fisadi centre jiesti he
 Accordingly, Ramesh takes 90,000 tax as state GST and 90,000 centers as GST
 ye paisa ramesh donon khajaane main jamaa kara dete hai
 Now Suresh ji, 10 this goods to Mahesh Chand of Jodhpur
 50 lakh main bechate hai
 GST will be charged by whoever sells it
 to suresh ji 94,500 state jiesti or 94,500 centre jiesti mahesh ji se vasuul le lete hai
 Now the question comes whether Suresh ji will also deposit 94,500 rupees in state GST
 jawaab he nahin
 Since Suresh ji has given 90,000 state and 90,000 centers as GST to Ramesh ji, he will deduct this money from the GST given earlier
 yani donon jagahon par 94,500 main se 90,000 mines ho jaae
 In this way, they will deposit 4500 rupees in the state GST account and the same center will deposit it in the GST account
 ummid he ki aaj mere skool ke ganit ke teacher 'prime time' nahin dekh rahe honge, varna unhen sadma lag saktaa he ki jo ladkaa ganit main phiseddi tha wo tivi par desh ko jod-ghataav kaise samajha rahaa he
 Let me tell you that i have taken the book of Sudhir ji, i have not set my mind
 jiesti ke saath puraane kar samaapt ho jaaenge magar ek rajya se duusare rajya ke bich maal le jane par ek nai vyavastha se guzaranaa hoga jiskaa naam he integrated guds and sarvice tex
 During this time road permit tax has to be paid, which is not yet removed
 suresh halaakhandee maanate hai ki road permit tex to dene honge
 So is it tax in addition to GST
 agar aisa he to phir jiesti ek kar kaise he
 Integrated GST is not a new tax but a new system
 iske zariye do rajyon ke bich vyapaar par nazar rakhi jaaegi
 It is being said that this will complicate the process
 kaise jatil hogi, jab main ise padhane laga to chakkar aa gaya
 Then left and understand what you see in the advertisements
 vaise suresh ji ne kaaphi saral tareeke se samajha diya he lekin tivi par samayabhaav or jagahabhav ke kaaran ham use chhod rahe hai
 If history is being made, you should also do some hard work
 ab aate hai ritern par
 Three returns have to be filed every month which will be different from each other
 GSTR-1, masik bikri kaa vivaran hoga jo agle maheene kii das taarikh tak jamaa karnaa hoga
 GSTR-2 will be the details of the monthly purchase which has to be submitted by the 15th of the next month
 10 taarikh se pehle jamaa nahin kar sakate kyonki aapako das tak bikri kaa vivaran jamaa karnaa hoga, isliye aap kharid kaa vivaran 10 ke baad hi 15 taarikh tak jamaa karne honge
 GSTR-3 This is the monthly tax return which has to be submitted by the 20th of the following month
 GSTR-9 ye vaarshik ritern he jo vitt varsh kii samaapti ke baad 31 disambar tak jamaa karne honge
 Thus, 37 returns have to be filled in the entire year
 yah ritern sarkaar ne jo jiestn network banaaya he vahaan jaakar bharne honge
 In the past, you were paying VAT and filling online only
 sudhir halaakhandee ne likhaa he ki isse jude praavdhaanon ke paalan ke liye kaaphi mehnat kerani hogi, balki samay kii mushkil seemaa kaa bhi paalan karnaa hoga kyonki jabatak pehla vikreta ritern nahin bharegaa, tab tak usase kareedne vaala apana ritern nahin bhar sakegaa
 As soon as this happens, the entire chain will break and the system will know
 is antar ko thik karne ke liye sirf do maheene kaa samay diya gaya he
 If the first dealer did not fill the returns, closed the shop and disappeared, then the same amount of GST you have given to him, you will replenish the same amount
 agar pehle vaale kaa vichaar badal gaya or usne bhar diya to aapako wo rakam waapas mil jaaegi
 Now you will say how do we know that the dealer you are buying the goods from is trustworthy
 to iske liye jiesti kii site par dealron kii reating di jaaegi
 Every trader will be able to see the rating of another trader which will be on the GSTN site
 ab aate hai bill par
 On 1 July you go to your shop
 graahak ko maal bechate hai to pehla jiesti bill kaise kaatenge
 Apart from computer, you can get your bill book printed under GST
 maan lijie ki aap kapadaa vyapaaree hai
 On Saturday, when a customer arrives at your shop and buys 100 shirts, how to make the bill
 kul 15 prakaar kii jaankaree honi chahie aapke paas
 Seller and buyer must have name, address and GSTN number
 bill jari karne kii taarikh, uskaa serial number bhi hona chahie
 You have to enter the description, quantity and total price of the goods
 dealer ke dastakhat anivaary hai
 There will be three copies of each bill
 ek aap rakhenge, doosraa kharidaar ke paas or teesraa transporter ke liye
 You should get it printed
 tippaniyan Every merchant has to bear the cost of printing
 jiesti ke tahat sazaa kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 Are there provisions for arrest under GST
 kya isse choti moti naadaani aapako jail main pahunchaa degi, ye ashanka he yaa vaaki aisa he
 They also try to know
 suresh ji ne hindi main likhaa he ki jiesti kii dhara 69 main giraftaar ke praavdhaan diye gaye hai
 If someone has committed a crime under 132 then one can get arrested
 sijisti adhikari giraftaar karegaa or aadesh ayukta kaa hoga
 Some offenses are non-bailable and some are bailable
 bagaiyr ayukta ke aadesh ke giraftaar nahin ho sakegi
 Will supply goods without bills, with the intention of evading tax
 bina jiesti liye bill jari karne par jail ja sakate hai
 Will not go to jail for three months after taking GST
 agar 2 karod se zyaada kii chori he to giraftaar ke praavdhaan lagu hote hai
 That is, you can avoid going to jail for tax evasion of less than 2 crores
 madhyam or chote shrenee ke dealer ko darane kii zarurat nahin he
 But if you violate GST twice then you can go to jail
 tab yah nahin dekha jayega ki 2 karod kii kar chori kaa aarope he yaa nahin
 0 percent, 5 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent tax are under GST
 aavashyak vastuon ko jiesti se baahar rakhaa gaya he to kai chizein aisi hai jo pehali baar tex ke daayre main aaengi
 Hopefully my school's math teacher will not be watching 'prime time' today, or else he may be shocked how the boy who was a math loser is explaining the subtraction to the country on TV
 unke liye bataa duun ki maine sudhir ji kii kitaab tip lee he, apana koi dimaag nahin lagaaya he
 The old taxes will be abolished with GST, but when moving goods from one state to another, one has to go through a new system called Integrated Goods and Service Tax
 is dauraan road permit tex bhi dena hota he, jo abhi nahin hataa he
 Suresh Hhalakhandi believes that road permit tax will have to be paid
 to kya yah jiesti ke atirikt kar he
 If so, then how is GST a tax? integrated jiesti koi nayaa kar nahin he balki nayaa tantra he
 Through this, the trade between the two states will be monitored
 kaha ja rahaa he ki isse prakriyaayein thodi jatil ho jaaengi
 How complicated it would be when i started reading it
 phir chhod diya baaki aap jo vigyapanon main chapa he use dekhakar samaj len
 Although Suresh ji has explained it in a very simple way, but due to timeliness and vigor on TV, we are leaving him
 itihaas ban rahaa he to thodi mehnat aap bhi kiijie
 Now come to the return
 har maheene teen ritern bharne honge jo ek-duusare se alag honge
 GSTR-1 will be the details of the monthly sales which have to be submitted by the 10th of the next month
 GSTR-2 masik kharid kaa vivaran hoga jo agle maah kii 15 taarikh tak jamaa karnaa hoga
 Can't submit before 10 date because you have to submit the details of the sale till ten, so you will have to submit the details of the purchase only after the 15th
 GSTR-3 ye masik kar kaa ritern he jo agle maah kii 20 taarikh tak jamaa karne honge
 GSTR-9 is the annual return which has to be submitted by 31 December after the end of the financial year
 is prakaar puure saal main 37 ritern bharne honge
 The GSTN network created by the government will have to be returned
 aap pehle bhi waite vagairah online hi bhar rahe the
 Sudhir Hhalakhandi has written that it will have to work very hard to follow the provisions related to it, but also to adhere to the difficult time limit because till the first seller returns, the buyer will not be able to fill his returns
 aisa hote hi puri chen main brake aa jayega or system ko pataa chal jayega
 Only two months have been given to correct this gap
 agar pehle dealer ne ritern nahin bharaa, dukaan band kar gaayab ho gaya to jo jiesti aapane use di he, utani hi rakam aap dobaaraa bharenge
 If the idea of the former changed and filled it, you will get that amount back
 ab aap kahenge ki hamen kaise maaloom ki jisase maal kharid rahe hai wo dealer bharosemand he
 So for this, the rating of dealers will be given on the site of GST
 har vyapaaree duusare vyapaaree kii reating dekh sakegaa jo jiestn kii site par hogi
 Now come to the bill
 1 july ko aap apni dukaan par jate hai
 If you sell goods to the customer then how to deduct the first GST bill
 jiesti ke tahat aap computer ke alaava apni bill book bhi chhapava sakate hai
 Suppose you are a cloth merchant
 shanivaar ko aapaki dukaan par koi graahak pahunchataa he or 100 shart kharidta he to bill kaise banaayenge
