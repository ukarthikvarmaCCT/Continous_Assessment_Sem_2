 a former Mumbai-based encounter specialist, Emmanuel Amolik, is being clamped in the Navi Mumbai builder murder case
 court ne amolic ko paanch din kii police castady main bhej diya he
 Police claim that there was a continuous discussion between the shooters and Amolik
 police ko kol ditels se ye byora mila he
 Apart from this, an attacker also took the name of Amolik
 police kaa kahana he ki esake builder or amolic main ranjish chal rahi thi jisaki vajah se hatya hui
 Amolik was considered an encounter specialist in the eighties and has also been honored with the President

 In which people caught a crook and handed it over to the police
 vahiin vaardaat kii sisitivi footage main bhi hatya kii ye sansanikhej vaardaat kaid ho gai
 According to eyewitnesses, as the builder Sunil Loharia arrived outside his office in the morning, two miscreants started firing bullets at him
 itnaa hi nahin badmaashon ne unpar chaakuon se bhi hamalaa kiya
 Hearing the sound of gunfire, the builder's staff came out of the office and chased and caught an attacker with the help of people
 vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad doosraa hamalavar koparkhayrane stesan kii taraf faraar ho gaya
 When the young Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, took power about six months ago, the people of the state and especially the youth had great expectations from him but Akhilesh was stuck in his own eyes for the first six months
 lagbhag chah maheene pehle sampann hue vidhansabha chunaav main samaajawaadee party (sapa) ko pranchad bahumat mila tha
 Due to this majority, the SP returned to power
 mukhyamantri kaa ohada sanbhaalane ke baad hi akhilesh ne kaha tha ki chunaav main janata se kiye gaye sabhi vaade puure kiye jaaenge or chah maheene baad bhi vah manch se yahi kehete najar aa rahe hai ki janata se kiye gaye vaade puure honge
 However, along with being in the position of Chief Minister, his father and SP national president Mulayam Singh Yadav also said that Akhilesh should be given six months time, but during the last about six months there have been many occasions when Akhilesh has got his own Because of this, shame had to be raised
 sapa sarkaar ke chah maheene puure hone par 15 sitambar ko kaaryakramon ke aayojan kii ruparekha taiyaar kii ja rahi he, jisamen akhilesh kii uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan kiya jayega
 It is expected to praise the scheme of Kanya Vidyadhan, unemployment allowance, loan waiver of farmers, withdrawal of cases from farmers and laptops and tablets to students
 beete chah maheenon ke dauraan mulaayam ke kareebi or nagar vikaas mantri ajam khan bhi kabhi akhilesh to kabhi mulaayam ke liye mushkilen paidaa karte rahe
 On many occasions, Akhilesh and his father also had to bow to their arbitrariness
 najdiki mantriyon ne akhilesh se aise faislon kii ghoshnaa karai, jinhen fajihat ke baad badalane bhi pade
 During the session of the assembly, Akhilesh had announced to allow the mlas to buy cars from his fund but he had to back down from his decision the very next day
 iske baad akhilesh sarkaar ke kaddavar mantri ajam ne vidhansabha main ghoshnaa kii ki soobe main bijli kaa sankat he, isliye shaam saat baje ke baad mal or restaraan ko sarkaar bijli uplabdh nahin karaayegi
 The engaged hand Shivpal also added his voice
 agle din virodh pradarshan kaa silsilaa shuru hua to sarkaar ko apane faisle se ek baar phir peeche hatana padaa
 With the formation of the government, the challenge before Akhilesh was that the rule of law and order should be established in the state, but in the last six months, the growth of socialist workers has increased the most
 aae din sapaayiyon or police ke bich jhadpen hoti rahati hai
 Seeing this attitude of the Spaniards, Mulayam himself had to come forward and advise him to remain in discipline
 sapa kii sarkaar banane ke baad lagbhag chah maheene ke bheetar aparaadhik ghatnaon main vruddhi hui
 Many cases of murder, robbery, kidnapping, rape took place and every time the Chief Minister kept saying that those who play with law and order will not be spared
 chah maah ke shashan ke bheetar hi bareli main dange hue jisamen kai log maare gaye
 Later curfew was imposed in these districts
 assam hinsa ke maamle main 17 agast ko lakhanu, kanpur or elahabad kii sadakon par jamkar updrav hua or police tamashbin bani rahi
 Before the assembly elections, the SP had announced that a commission would be set up to investigate the scandals that took place during the bsp's rule, but nothing has happened in this direction so far
 shivpal yadav ne mayawati ke bangale main sarkari dhan ke istemaal kaa aarope lagaaya lekin sarkaar agle din isaki jaanch karaane se palat gai
 After this, Shivpal accused former Cooperative Minister Swami Prasad Maurya of the scam but when Maurya retaliated, Shivpal was seen cutting off the matter
 iske alaava apane vivaadaaspad bayanon se shivpal ne sarkaar ke liye kai baar museebataan khadi kii
 Azam Khan also did not lag behind Shivpal
 nagar ayukta kii niyukti ke maamle ko lekar unhone vibhaag kaa kaamkaaj hi chhod diya
 N
 to the government to persuade Ruthe Azam
 pi
 Action had to be taken against Singh
 usee tarah kai baar ajam ne apni hath ke aage sarkaar ko jhukaaya
 If sources are to be believed, Azam is not pleased with Mulayam's close proximity to Imam Bukhari
 akhilesh sarkaar ke teen maheene puure hone par mulaayam ne apane bete ko 100 main se 100 nambar die the ab dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki 15 sitambar ko chah maheene puraa hone par vah apane suputr ko kitne nambar dete hai
 In this regard, the state spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) says that the government has proved to be a failure on every front during its tenure of six months
 bhrashtachar ke maamle to ujagar hue lekin beete chah maheene main bade paimaane par koi karrwai nahin hui
 The government was seen to compromise corruption during six months
 pathak ne kaha ki kanoon-vyavastha ke mudde par sarkaar ko munh kii khaani padi
 On August 17, the streets of the capital were disturbed but the police could not do anything and in the other incidents, the police ran and beat the people in two incidents, which led to two faces of the police
 akhilesh sarkaar ke chah maheene puure hone ke sawaal par bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke pradesh adhyaksh ranchal rajbhar ne kaha ki pehle chah maheene kii baat karen to sarkaar har mudde par puri tarah se fail hui he
 There are no achievements
 mulaayam singh to apane bete ko kabhi 100 nambar dete hai to kabhi jiro nambar, ab is baar dekhte hai ki vah kya kehete hai

 Restoration of suspended IAS Durga Shakti Nagpal hangs in the balance
 is bich jaankaree ye mili he ki durga ke tabadale kaa aadesh aadhi raat ko daftar kholkar jari kiya gaya
 However, CM Akhilesh Yadav was present in Bangalore at that time
 jaankaree ye bhi mili he ki kuch varisht adhikari durga ke nilamban ke paksh main nahin the
 But under pressure from a minister of the government and mining mafias, Noida mining officer Ashish Kumar was transferred and then Durga Shakti Nagpal was suspended due to alleged tension arising after demolishing the shrine
 jabaki sthaneey police ke mutabik aisa koi tanaav nahin tha jisase maahaul kharaab hota
 After all, what was the reason due to which Durga Shakti Nagpal was suspended at midnight in a hurry
 kya mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko isaki ittala di gayi thi or kya vajah thi ki agle din subah mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav nilamban kaa sarmathan karte najar aaye
 Party spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary says that transfer and suspension are the prerogative of any chief minister
 isapar koi sawaal nahin uthaanaa chaiye
 Opposition is doing politics in this
 rahi baat iees association ke shikaayat darj karne kii to mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar main itani to chhot he ki log apni shikaayat darj kara saken
 The government may be arguing that Durga was transferred in connection with breaking the wall of the shrine
 magar hakeekat ye he ki avaidh khanan rokane ke kaaran hi durga ko nilamban jhelana padaa
 The mining mafia is said to have caused huge losses in a week to stop illegal mining
 noida main 18-24 july ke bich avaidh khanan ke pandrah maamle pakade gayi
 Three jcbs and forty vehicles like dumper, tractor, trolley etc
 were seized
 isse yamuna or hindon se baaluu ke avaidh khanan main lage logon ko kaaphi nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 Angry mining mafia first transferred the mining officer Ashish Kumar
 wo 25 july ko vahaan se relive ho gayi or phir teen din baad esadm durga shakti nagpal ko bhi suspend kar diya gaya
 According to socialist government minister Azam Khan about illegal mining, it is a gift of nature, everyone has the right
 ram naam kaa jaap karo
 If looted, loot it

 Gujarat's Chief Minister Narendra Modi made a huge contribution to the hat-trick of power, but it is ironic that since the formation of this developed state till date the number of women in the Vidhan Sabha here has not been even 10% whereas Bihar like In the last election of the backward state assembly, this figure had crossed 13 percent
 gujarat main 13veen vidhansabha ke gathan ke liye hue chunaav ne phir se mahilaon ko niraash kiya
 Only 16 women managed to reach here in the 182-seat assembly
 yah gujarat kii raajnneeti main mahilaon kii sthiti kaa kadava sach he, jahaan rajya kii sthapana ke 60 saal baad bhi kisi bhi vidhansabha main mahilaon kii sankhya 16 ke aankade ko paar nahin kar pai he
 On the question asked by BJP National Secretary Vani Tripathi on the representation of women in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly, he said, 'BJP has always tried to connect women with the system and this has been seen in Gujarat in recent years
 yah thik he ki apekshaakrit mahilaayein vidhansabha main nahin pahunch pai hai
 But it is a long process
 ummid he jald hi vidhansabha main mahilaon kaa pratinidhitiv badhegaa
 'on the one hand, 33 percent women reservation is said in Parliament and Vidhan Sabha, but in a state like Gujarat the number of women candidates was only 91 out of 1,666 candidates
 in mahila ummidavaaron ne congress, bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa)jaisi badi partiyon sahit gujarat parivartan party (jipipi), bahujan samaaj party (basapa), samaajawaadee party (sapa) kii tikad par chunaav lade the
 Of these, Congress fielded 14 and BJP fielded only 16 women candidates
 parinaam kii baat karen or bijepi kii 14 or congress kii sirf 4 mahila ummidawar hi vidhansabha main apni daavedaari siddh kar pai jabaki anya partiyon kaa khaataa bhi nahin khul paaya
 But in spite of all this, there were some women who were being discussed everywhere who dared to stand in front of the tall leaders of Gujarat
 nilambit ipies adhikari sanjeev bhatta kii patni shweta bhatta jinhone congress kii tikat par maninagar se modi ke khilaaf morcha sambhaala haalanki unhen haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa or modi ne un par 86,373 vot ke bade antar se jeet hasil kii
 Another female candidate, Jagruti Pandya, former Gujarat home minister and wife of BJP leader late Hiren Pandya, was on a GPP ticket, defeated by bjp's Rakesh Shah by 97,566 votes
 haalanki, is haar ke ulat ek doosraa sach ye bhi he ki bijepi kii mahila ummidavaar anandi patel ne rajya ke sabhi ummidavaaron se zyada vot hasil kiye
 He defeated Rameshbhai Prahlad Bhai Patel of Congress from Ghatlodiya seat in Ahmedabad

 Another Congress candidate Chandrika Ben Baria defeated bjp's Mahendra Ben Rathore from Garbada seat
 gujarat main mahilaon kii aabaadi lagbhag dhai karod he or shaayad yahi vajah he ki apni jeet ke baad mukhyamantri narendra modi ne rajya kii mahilaon ke prati aabhaar prakat kiya he jinhone matdaan main bad-chadh kar hissaa liya tha
 After this victory of Modi, now the discussion on his claim to the post of Prime Minister is in full swing and somewhere his claim is being challenged by the Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar and on the other hand, if you see the results of the last assembly of Bihar, then here on 243 assembly seat 32 women have been held

 hindustan ke mahaan cricketron main shumaar kumaar shri ranjit singhji ke naam ek adbhut kirtiman he
 This Indian veteran, playing on behalf of the British, made history today (22 August) in 1896
 darasal, unhone pratham shrenee cricket main ek hi din main do shatak lagane kaa karnama kiya tha
 Ranjit Singhji scored an unbeaten 154 runs a month earlier, making his Test debut for England (july 1896) and continuing the same form, playing for Sussex in the English city of Hove in a single day against Yorkshire
 Two centuries (100 and 125 not out) were played
 sasex kii ore se khelte hue kiya tha karnamyorkshaire ne pehle khelte hue apni pehali pari main 407 ran banaae
 In response, Sussex team was reduced to 191 runs despite Ranjit Singhji's century (100 runs) on the third day and could not save the follow-on
 iske baad foloon pari main ek baar phir ranjit singhji ne naabad 125 ran bana daale or ek hi din main do shatak lagane kaa karishma kar dikhaaya
 Sussex scored 260 / 2 to save the match thanks to Ranjit Singhji's century
 facts-iske saath hi ek hi match main do shatak lagane vaale sasex ke tisare ballebaaj bane
 But more than this, in First Class cricket, he became the only cricketer to score two centuries on the same day
 -ranjit singhji ke baad se kisi bhi ballebaaj ne pratham shrenee cricket main aisa karnama nahin kiya he
 However, playing for Western Australia, Matthew Eliot scored 104 runs on 31 December 1995 and then 135 runs in the follow-on innings
 tab aliot ne pehali pari main ek din pehle 98 ran banaakar naabad rahe the
 For this reason, Elliott's centuries cannot be compared to Ranjit Singhji
 - haa, spain ke ballebaaj tarik ali awan ne 4 sitambar 2012 ko european championships divijan-2 tii-20 main ek hi din naabad 150 or 148 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 Tariq then scored 150 not out from 66 balls against Estonia and 148 in the semi-final against Portugal in the next match on the same day
 haalanki unki team final main sthaan banane se chook gai
 Ranjit Singhji's career 1
 ranjit singhji england kii taraf se 15 test maichon main utre or ye sabhi match australia ke khilaaf the
 He never played a match for India
 2
 He was the first Indian to play Test cricket for England 3
 unhone 989 test ran 44
 With an average of 95, his highest score was 175 4
 1915 main ranjai shikaar ke vakt jakhmi ho gaye or dayee aankh kii roshni kho baithe5
 The country's prestigious first class cricket tournament - Ranji Trophy is named after him baat ho rahi thi ki kashmir se baat nahin ho rahi he to sansad main kashmir par baat hui, tay hua ki kashmir se baat karenge lekin kashmir par kisi se baat nahin karenge, ab jab bhi baat karenge paak adhikrut kashmir par baat karenge
 In the Rajya Sabha, Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav had said why India does not take up the issue of Pak Occupied Kashmir
 pradhanmantri ne sarvadaleey baithak main baluchistan or paak adhikrut kashmir kaa masalaa uthaaya
 Everyone agreed but no one had any idea that the Prime Minister would say this to the Red Fort as well
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, 'jin logon ke vishay main meri kabhi mulaakaat nahin hui he, lekin aise dur sudur baithe hue log hindustan ke pradhanmantri ko abhinandan karte hai, to wo mere sava sau karod desh vaasiyon kaa sammaan he or isliye ye sammaan kaa bhav, ye dhanyavad kaa bhav karne vaale baluchistan ke logon kaa, gilgit ke logon kaa, paak ke kabze vaale kashmir ke logon kaa main aaj tahe dil se aabhaar vyakt karnaa chahta hum
 ' kya is aabhaar ko bharat kaa sakriy samarthan samajha ja saktaa he
 After the all-party meeting on 12 August, there is an organization called the us-based Gilgit Baltistan National Congress, which thanked the Prime Minister of India for taking up the matter of human rights abuses and Baloch leader Brahmadagh Baguti has also welcomed the Prime Minister
 kya bharat ke liye in sanghathanon kii itani ahmiyat he ki pradhanmantri ne laal qila se sarvadaleey baithak kii jagah inke aabhaar ke prati aabhaar vyakt kiya
 What we call Pakistan Occupied Kashmir is divided into two parts in Pakistan
 azaad kashmir or doosraa gilgit blatistan
 India's 106 km border lies in Afghanistan, which falls in Pakistan occupied Kashmir
 may maheene main bharat ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dowal ne biguef ke afasaron se kaha tha ki hamen is 106 kimi kii seemaa ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana hoga jo afghanistan se lagati he
 a part of Gilgit Baltistan is from China
 yah behad kuubasurat ilaaka he
 K-2 is the world's second highest peak here
 22 farvari 1994 main narsinha raav sarkaar ke samay sansad ne ek prastaav paas kiya tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki badhati aatanki hinsa or kashmir vivaad ko uthaane kii pakistan kii koshishon ke maddenzar bhartiya sansad ke donon sadanon ne ek mat se 22 farvari 1994 ko ek prastaav paas kiya jisamen is baat par jor diya gaya ki jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he or pakistan ko apane kabze vaale kashmir ke ilaakon ko khaali kar dena chahie
 In October 2015, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj at the United Nations said that if the pok is in the possession of foreign powers, then that foreign power is Pakistan
 isi saal do baar yani janvari or june maheene main videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne bhi kaha tha ki jammu kashmir kaa puraa rajya jisamen gilgit blatistan kaa kshetra bhi aata he, wo bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 There is a lot of excitement about Balochistan
 baluchistan pakistan ke chaar prashasnic praanton main se ek he
 Apart from this, there are three other provinces, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtoon Khwah and Sindh
 baluchistan kaa ilaaka afghanistan or iran se laga he
 Pakistan is the largest province but the population is very less
 baluchistan khanij padaarthon se las hokar bhi garib he
 Movements of different factions are going on here regarding Baloch nationality
 is ilaake kii raajnneeti jaanane vaale kehete hai ki balooch logon par pakistan ne beintahaa zulm dhaae hai
 Pakistan considers their movement as extremism
 kai balooch netaa alag alag deshon main rah rahe hai
 Gwadar port is in Balochistan which is being built by China
 isi ke jawaab main bharat ne iran main chabahaar bandargah banane kaa kaam apane jimme liya he
 Even in the year of 2009, there has been a ruckus in India's politics regarding Balochistan
 us saal 16 july ke rose ejipt ke shame al shaikh se bharat or pakistan ne ek saajha bayaan jari kar kaha tha ki donon desh sahamat hai ki aatankwaad se donon ko khatara he
 Both leaders have agreed that real-time data will be shared regarding any future terrorist attack
 pradhanmantri gilaani ne is baat kaa zikr kiya ki baluchistan or anya ilaakon main khataron ko lekar pakistan ke paas kuch suchnaae hai
 Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh said that the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks need to be punished
 loksabhaa main bijepi netaa yashamvat sinha ne kaha tha ki main pradhanmantri ji se kahana chahta hum ki jo shame al shaikh main hua he, saaton samudr kaa pani ikatta karke agar us shame ko dhone kaa prayaas humlog karenge to vah shame nahin dhulane vaali he
 The BJP was very aggressive at that time, by accepting the reference of Balochistan in a shared statement, India has accepted the charge of Pakistan that there is a role of India in instigating militancy there
 bharat kii videsh niti ghoshit taur par yahi rahi he ki bharat kisi mulk ke aatanrik maamalon main dakhal nahin detaa he
 In his 2014 speech before becoming National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval had said, 'even if you take a defensive stance, 100 stones are thrown at you and if you stop 90, even 10 stones harm you
 aise main aap kabhi jeet nahin sakate
 Because either you lose or the status quo remains
 agar aap rakshaatmak ranneeti ko badalakar rakshaatmak aakraamak rukh apana lete hai to unhen pataa lagegaa ki wo ise lambey samay tak nahin jhel sakate
 If you do another Mumbai then you will lose Baluchistan
 ' Is the Indian government moving forward on the thinking or policy of Ajit Doval Saheb
 bangladesh or srilanka ke maamle main bharat sainya hastkshep kar chukaa he ab sawaal uth rahe hai ki is bayaan ke baad bharat saarvajanik rup se kya karegaa
 Will Prime Minister Modi say on the world forums that India had a role in Balochistan or will it now? Will India intervene like Sri Lanka in military intervention to protect human rights in Balochistan? Will India take up any UN forum on Balochistan? Will India talk of any kind of economic ban on forums like G20? kya maanavadhikaar ko lekar bharat kii ranneeti sirf pakistan tak hi simit he yaa tibeti log bhi bharat se china ke kilaaf kuch ummid kar sakate hai, nepal main rahane vaale bhartiya mul ke log bhi nayaa samvidhan lagu hone ke baad bharat se kuch ummid kar sakate hai
 The policy between India and Pakistan runs more than domestic policy less than foreign policy
 lekin jo sambandh shapath grahan main nawaz shareef ke aane se pragadh ho rahe the, nawaz shareef ne pradhanmantri modi kii maa ko sari bhent kii, modi ji ne bhi nawaz shareef kii maa ko shawl or vaajapeyi kii kavita gift kar di
 Prime Minister Modi surprised everyone by visiting Lahore on the birthday of Nawaz Sharif
 hamen bataaya gaya ki ek nayaa itihaas ban rahaa he jo li se hat kar he
 Pathankot was also patient with the attack on the airbase
 jahaan se aatanki aae vahiin se jaanch dal ko bhi aane diya gaya taaki airbase ke prabhavit ilaakon kaa daura kar sake
 Will all these pictures be included in the black and white era album
 kya bharat ne us itihaas ko ab koodaydaan main daalane kaa faisla kar liya he
 To those who have not been students of history, i can tell them one thing as a student
 itihaas ko lekar sabar kii zarurat hoti he
 Even in making history, in writing history and also in reading history
 puraane itihaas se moh chhudaakar nayaa likhnaa aasaan nahin hota he
 So India and Pakistan have now returned to those pages where they both seem happy
 donon apane apane pich par pahunch gaye hai
 He is throwing the ball himself and hitting himself for a six
 tippaniyan Ambassador Abdul Basit challenged the independence of his country in the name of independence of Kashmir in the Pakistan Embassy in Delhi
 islamabad main sartaaj azeez ne kaha he ki baluchistan pakistan kaa abhinn ang hai
 Modi's statement has proved Pakistan's point that India is creating terrorism there through its intelligence organization RAW
 pradhanmantri nawaz sharif ne kaha he ki duniya ko is par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he ki nirdosh kashmiriyon par kis tarah kii zyadatiyaan ho rahi hai
 Kashmiris are sacrificing for their right to freedom
 pichley saal november main pakistan ne mumbai hamalon ke master mind hafiz said ke kisi bhi itanravyuu yaa bayaan ko channelon par dikhaane se roak laga di thi
 This restriction has been lifted on Tuesday
 indian express ne sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he
 If the Prime Minister wanted, he could have referred to the terrorist attack in Quetta, Balochistan on August 8, in which 70 people were killed, 120 people were injured, but from the Red Fort, he referred to the terrorist attack in the military school of Peshawar in 2014
 us hamale main 140 bachche or teacher maare gaye the jinke prati bharat ke skulon main shok manaaya gaya tha
 The Prime Minister also said that the two countries have to fight together
 ek taraf alag alag morche kii baat ho rahi he, duusari taraf ek milakar ladane kii baat ho rahi he
 It is a matter of human rights that the provision of the United Nations allows a country to enter a country on this basis
 vaise jo desh chahta he wo ghusaa hi hua he
 Ukraine, Yemen, Syria, Iraq
 kya ab baatcheet kii jagah baton kii baat hogi yaa kahin aisa to nahin ki ham kisi aakraamak yani yuddh kii taraf bad rahe hai
 The Prime Minister had said, 'people about whom i have never met, but people sitting far away like this greet the Prime Minister of India, then it is an honor for my 1
25 billion people and therefore this respect , i want to express my heartfelt gratitude today to the people of Balochistan who express their thanks, to the people of Gilgit, to the people of Pakistan who are in possession of Pakistan
 ' Can this gratitude be understood as India's active support? 12 agast ke sarvadaleey baithak baad america sthit gilgit blatistan neshnal congress naam kaa ek sanghathan he jisane maanavadhikaar ke hanan kaa maamla uthaane par bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa aabhaar vyakt kiya or balooch netaa brahmadagh bagooti ne bhi pradhanmantri kaa swaagat kiya he
 Are these organizations so important to India that the Prime Minister expressed his gratitude for the place of all-party meeting with the Red Fort
 jise ham paak adhikrut kashmir kehete hai use pakistan main do hisson main baanta gaya he
 Azad Kashmir and second Gilgit Baltistan
 bharat kii 106 kimi seemaa afghanistan main padati he jo paak adhikrut kashmir main padati he
 In May, India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval told BSF officials that we also have to keep in mind the 106-km border that borders Afghanistan
 gilgit blatistan ek hissaa china se lagata he
 This is a very beautiful area
 duniya kii duusari sabase oonchi chotii ke-2 yaheen he
 On 22 February 1994, the Parliament passed a resolution during the Narasimha Rao government stating that in view of the growing terrorist violence and Pakistan's efforts to raise the Kashmir dispute, both houses of the Indian Parliament adopted a resolution on 22 February 1994 Passed which emphasized that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and Pakistan should vacate its occupied Kashmir areas
 oktober 2015 main sanyukt raashtra sangh main videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kaa bayaan he ki ki agar pioke videshi shaktiyon ke kabze main he to wo videshi shakti pakistan he
 Twice this year, in the months of January and June, the Ministry of External Affairs, Vikas Swaroop had also said that the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir which also includes the region of gilgit-baltistan is an integral part of India
 baluchistan ko lekar khaasaa hadakamp he
 Balochistan is one of the four administrative provinces of Pakistan
 iske alaava teen anya praant hai, punjab, kaibar pakhtun khwaah or sindh
 The territory of Balochistan is bordered by Afghanistan and Iran
 pakistan kaa sabase bada praant he magar aabaadi bahut kam he
 Baluchistan is also poor being equipped with minerals
 yahaan par balooch rashtriyata ko lekar alag alag guton ke andolan chal rahe hai
 Those who know the politics of this region say that Pakistan has inflicted extreme persecution on the Baloch people
 pakistan unke andolan ko ugravad maanata he
 Many Baloch leaders are living in different countries
 guadar bandargah baluchistan main hi he jise china bana rahaa he
 In response to this, India has taken the responsibility of building Chabahar port in Iran
 2009 ke saal main bhi baluchistan ko lekar bharat kii raajnneeti main ghamaasan ho chukaa he
 On 16 July that year, India and Pakistan issued a joint statement to Sharm el-sheikh of the Daily Egypt that both countries agreed that both were at risk from terrorism
 donon netaa is baat par raji hue hai ki kisi bhi bhavi aatanki hamale ko lekar real time data saajha kiya jayega
 Prime Minister Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information about threats in Balochistan and other areas
 bharat ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha tha ki mumbai hamalon ke gunaahagaaron ko sazaa dene kii zarurat he
 BJP leader in Lok Sabha Yashwant Sinha had said that i want to tell the Prime Minister that what has happened in Sharm el-sheikh, if we try to wash that shame by collecting the seven sea water, it is not going to wash away the shame
 bijepi us vakt kaaphi aakraamak thi ki saajha bayaan main baluchistan kaa zikr sweekaar kar bharat ne pakistan ke aarope ko sweekaar kar liya he ki vahaan ugravad bhadakaane main bharat kii bhoomika he
 India's foreign policy has been declared that India does not interfere in the internal affairs of any country
 rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar banane se pehle 2014 ke apane ek bhaashan main ajit dobhaal ne kaha tha, 'rakshaatmak rukh apnaane ke dauraan agar aap par 100 pathar phenke jate hai or aap 90 roak lete hai to bhi 10 pathar aapako nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 In such a situation you can never win
 kyonki yaa to aap haar jate hai yaa phir yathasthiti bani rahati he
 If you change the defensive strategy and adopt a defensive offensive approach, then they will find that they cannot afford it for long
 aap ek or mumbai karenge to aap baluchistan kho denge
 ' kya bharat sarkaar ajit dobhaal sahab kii soch yaa niti par aage bad rahi he
 India has made military intervention in the case of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, now questions are being raised about what India will do publicly after this statement
 kya pradhanmantri modi duniya ke manchon par kahenge ki baluchistan main bharat kii bhoomika thi yaa ab hogi? kya baluchistan main maanavadhikaar kii raksha ke liye bharat srilanka kii tarah sainya hastkshep karegaa? kya bharat baluchistan ko lekar sanyukt raashtra ke kisi manch par uthayega? kya bharat ji-20 jaise manchon par kisi prakaar ke aarthik pratibandh kii baat karegaa? Is India's strategy for human rights limited to Pakistan only or Tibetan people can expect something from India against China, people of Indian origin living in Nepal can also expect something from India after the new constitution is implemented 
 bharat pakistan ke bich kii niti videsh niti se kam gharelu niti se zyada chalati he
 But the ties which were intensifying with the arrival of Nawaz Sharif at the swearing-in, Nawaz Sharif presented a sari to Prime Minister Modi's mother, Modi ji gifted Nawaz Sharif's mother a shawl and Vajpayee's poem
 nawaz shareef ke janmdin par lahore jaakar pradhanmantri modi ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 We were told that a new history is being created which is out of the box
 us khushrahmi main pathankot airbase par hue hamale par bhi sabar kar gaye
 From where the terrorists came, the investigation team was also allowed to come so that they could visit the affected areas of the airbase
 kya ye sab tasviren blike and white ke jamaane vaale album main samaa jaaengi
 Has India now decided to dump that history into the dustbin? jo log itihaas ke vidhyaarthee nahin rahe hai unhen main vidhyaarthee hone ke naate ek baat bataa saktaa hum
 History requires patience
 itihaas banane main bhi, itihaas likhane main bhi or itihaas padhane main bhi
 It is not easy to write new by ridding the old history
 isliye bharat or pakistan ab un pannon par phir se waapas pahunch gaye hai jahaan ve donon khush nazar aate hai
 Both have reached their respective pitches
 khud hi gend phenk rahe hai khud hi chakka maar rahe hai
 The comments dilli sthit pakistan duutavas main rajdoot abdul basit ne apane mulk kii azaadi ko kashmir kii azaadi ke naam kar bharat ko chunauti de di
 Sartaj Aziz in Islamabad has said that Balochistan is an integral part of Pakistan
 modi ke bayaan ne pakistan kii baat ko sahi sabit kar diya he ki bharat apane khufia sanghathan ro ke zariye vahaan aatankwaad paidaa kar rahaa he
 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said that the world needs to pay attention to what kind of excesses are happening on innocent Kashmiris
 apni azaadi ke adhikaar ke liye kashmiri balidaan de rahe hai
 In November last year, Pakistan banned any of the interviews or statements of Hafiz Saeed, mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, from being shown on the channels
 mangalvaar ko yah roak hataa lee gai he
 The Indian Express quoted sources as saying
 pradhanmantri chaahate to isi aath agast ko baluchistan ke queta main hue aatanki hamale kaa zikr kar sakate the jisamen 70 log maare gaye, 120 log ghayal hue lekin laal qile se unhone 2014 main peshawar ke sainik skool main hue aatanki hamale kaa zikr kiya
 140 children and teachers were killed in that attack, towards which there was mourning in schools in India
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi to kaha ki donon deshon ko milakar ladanaa hoga
 On one side there is talk of different front, on the other side there is talk of fighting together
 rahi baat maanavadhikaar kii to kya sanyukt raashtra sangh kaa praavdhaan is aadhaar par kisi desh ko kisi desh main ghusane kii anumati detaa he
 By the way, whatever the country wants, it has entered
 ukraine, yaman, syria, iraq
 Will it be a matter of talk instead of talk or is it somewhere that we are moving towards an aggressive war

 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi to kaha ki donon deshon ko milakar ladanaa hoga
 On one side there is talk of different front, on the other side there is talk of fighting together
 rahi baat maanavadhikaar kii to kya sanyukt raashtra sangh kaa praavdhaan is aadhaar par kisi desh ko kisi desh main ghusane kii anumati detaa he
 By the way, whatever the country wants, it has entered
 ukraine, yaman, syria, iraq
 Will it be a matter of talk instead of talk or is it somewhere that we are moving towards an aggressive war
 2009 ke saal main bhi baluchistan ko lekar bharat kii raajnneeti main ghamaasan ho chukaa he
 On 16 July that year, India and Pakistan issued a joint statement to Sharm el-sheikh of the Daily Egypt that both countries agreed that both were at risk from terrorism
 donon netaa is baat par raji hue hai ki kisi bhi bhavi aatanki hamale ko lekar real time data saajha kiya jayega
 Prime Minister Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information about threats in Balochistan and other areas
 bharat ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha tha ki mumbai hamalon ke gunaahagaaron ko sazaa dene kii zarurat he
 BJP leader in Lok Sabha Yashwant Sinha had said that i want to tell the Prime Minister that what has happened in Sharm el-sheikh, if we try to wash that shame by collecting the seven sea water, it is not going to wash away the shame
 bijepi us vakt kaaphi aakraamak thi ki saajha bayaan main baluchistan kaa zikr sweekaar kar bharat ne pakistan ke aarope ko sweekaar kar liya he ki vahaan ugravad bhadakaane main bharat kii bhoomika he
 India's foreign policy has been declared that India does not interfere in the internal affairs of any country
 rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar banane se pehle 2014 ke apane ek bhaashan main ajit dobhaal ne kaha tha, 'rakshaatmak rukh apnaane ke dauraan agar aap par 100 pathar phenke jate hai or aap 90 roak lete hai to bhi 10 pathar aapako nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 In such a situation you can never win
 kyonki yaa to aap haar jate hai yaa phir yathasthiti bani rahati he
 If you change the defensive strategy and adopt a defensive offensive approach, then they will find that they cannot afford it for long
 aap ek or mumbai karenge to aap baluchistan kho denge
 ' kya bharat sarkaar ajit dobhaal sahab kii soch yaa niti par aage bad rahi he
 India has made military intervention in the case of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, now questions are being raised about what India will do publicly after this statement
 kya pradhanmantri modi duniya ke manchon par kahenge ki baluchistan main bharat kii bhoomika thi yaa ab hogi? kya baluchistan main maanavadhikaar kii raksha ke liye bharat srilanka kii tarah sainya hastkshep karegaa? kya bharat baluchistan ko lekar sanyukt raashtra ke kisi manch par uthayega? kya bharat ji-20 jaise manchon par kisi prakaar ke aarthik pratibandh kii baat karegaa? Is India's strategy for human rights limited to Pakistan only or Tibetan people can expect something from India against China, people of Indian origin living in Nepal can also expect something from India after the new constitution is implemented 
 bharat pakistan ke bich kii niti videsh niti se kam gharelu niti se zyada chalati he
 But the ties which were intensifying with the arrival of Nawaz Sharif at the swearing-in, Nawaz Sharif presented a sari to Prime Minister Modi's mother, Modi ji gifted Nawaz Sharif's mother a shawl and Vajpayee's poem
 nawaz shareef ke janmdin par lahore jaakar pradhanmantri modi ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 We were told that a new history is being created which is out of the box
 us khushrahmi main pathankot airbase par hue hamale par bhi sabar kar gaye
 From where the terrorists came, the investigation team was also allowed to come so that they could visit the affected areas of the airbase
 kya ye sab tasviren blike and white ke jamaane vaale album main samaa jaaengi
 Has India now decided to dump that history into the dustbin? jo log itihaas ke vidhyaarthee nahin rahe hai unhen main vidhyaarthee hone ke naate ek baat bataa saktaa hum
 History requires patience
 itihaas banane main bhi, itihaas likhane main bhi or itihaas padhane main bhi
 It is not easy to write new by ridding the old history
 isliye bharat or pakistan ab un pannon par phir se waapas pahunch gaye hai jahaan ve donon khush nazar aate hai
 Both have reached their respective pitches
 khud hi gend phenk rahe hai khud hi chakka maar rahe hai
 The comments dilli sthit pakistan duutavas main rajdoot abdul basit ne apane mulk kii azaadi ko kashmir kii azaadi ke naam kar bharat ko chunauti de di
 Sartaj Aziz in Islamabad has said that Balochistan is an integral part of Pakistan
 modi ke bayaan ne pakistan kii baat ko sahi sabit kar diya he ki bharat apane khufia sanghathan ro ke zariye vahaan aatankwaad paidaa kar rahaa he
 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said that the world needs to pay attention to what kind of excesses are happening on innocent Kashmiris
 apni azaadi ke adhikaar ke liye kashmiri balidaan de rahe hai
 In November last year, Pakistan banned any of the interviews or statements of Hafiz Saeed, mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, from being shown on the channels
 mangalvaar ko yah roak hataa lee gai he
 The Indian Express quoted sources as saying
 pradhanmantri chaahate to isi aath agast ko baluchistan ke queta main hue aatanki hamale kaa zikr kar sakate the jisamen 70 log maare gaye, 120 log ghayal hue lekin laal qile se unhone 2014 main peshawar ke sainik skool main hue aatanki hamale kaa zikr kiya

 Will it be a matter of talk instead of talk or is it somewhere that we are moving towards an aggressive war
 loksabhaa main bijepi netaa yashamvat sinha ne kaha tha ki main pradhanmantri ji se kahana chahta hum ki jo shame al shaikh main hua he, saaton samudr kaa pani ikatta karke agar us shame ko dhone kaa prayaas humlog karenge to vah shame nahin dhulane vaali he
 The BJP was very aggressive at that time, by accepting the reference of Balochistan in a shared statement, India has accepted the charge of Pakistan that there is a role of India in instigating militancy there
 bharat kii videsh niti ghoshit taur par yahi rahi he ki bharat kisi mulk ke aatanrik maamalon main dakhal nahin detaa he
 In his 2014 speech before becoming National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval had said, 'even if you take a defensive stance, 100 stones are thrown at you and if you stop 90, even 10 stones harm you
 aise main aap kabhi jeet nahin sakate
 Because either you lose or the status quo remains
 agar aap rakshaatmak ranneeti ko badalakar rakshaatmak aakraamak rukh apana lete hai to unhen pataa lagegaa ki wo ise lambey samay tak nahin jhel sakate
 If you do another Mumbai then you will lose Baluchistan
 ' Is the Indian government moving forward on the thinking or policy of Ajit Doval Saheb
 bangladesh or srilanka ke maamle main bharat sainya hastkshep kar chukaa he ab sawaal uth rahe hai ki is bayaan ke baad bharat saarvajanik rup se kya karegaa
 Will Prime Minister Modi say on the world forums that India had a role in Balochistan or will it now? Will India intervene like Sri Lanka in military intervention to protect human rights in Balochistan? Will India take up any UN forum on Balochistan? Will India talk of any kind of economic ban on forums like G20? kya maanavadhikaar ko lekar bharat kii ranneeti sirf pakistan tak hi simit he yaa tibeti log bhi bharat se china ke kilaaf kuch ummid kar sakate hai, nepal main rahane vaale bhartiya mul ke log bhi nayaa samvidhan lagu hone ke baad bharat se kuch ummid kar sakate hai
 The policy between India and Pakistan runs more than domestic policy less than foreign policy
 lekin jo sambandh shapath grahan main nawaz shareef ke aane se pragadh ho rahe the, nawaz shareef ne pradhanmantri modi kii maa ko sari bhent kii, modi ji ne bhi nawaz shareef kii maa ko shawl or vaajapeyi kii kavita gift kar di
 Prime Minister Modi surprised everyone by visiting Lahore on the birthday of Nawaz Sharif

 Even in making history, in writing history and also in reading history

 This is the first time in the last several years that the Congress party has canceled the Iftar party in Uttar Pradesh, without giving any reason
 party ne ek press relies jari kar sirf itnaa kaha ki aprihaary kaarnon se yah iftaar party nahin hogi
 Iftar party was held on 22 June at Hotel Clarke in Lucknow, but it was quietly canceled on the evening of 20 June
 ab party ke bheetar se lekar muslim ulimaon tak main upi congress kii is iftaar party ke radd hone kii khaasi charchaa he
 As many things are happening within the party as well
 kuch netaaon ke mutabik party ise hotel main nahin karnaa chaahati thi, balki jhuggi jhopadi main iftaar party rakhana chaahati thi
 This is why it was canceled
 vahiin, kuch party pravaktaa yah kah rahe hai ki raashtrapati chunaav main gulam nabi aaazaad or raaj babbar ke vyast rahane kii vajah se yah iftaar party radd kii gai he
 Please tell that about 500 people have been sent an invitation to the Iftar feast on behalf of State President Raj Babbar, the hotel Clark's ground has been booked and the menu for the party was also ready, but the cancellation of Iftar without any reason Nobody is able to tell the real reason for this
 charchaa yah bhi he ki party zyada pro muslim dikhne se bachanaa chaahati he
 The Congress party is speaking out vigorously in this matter, but Muslim clerics have definitely raised their finger on the cancellation of the Iftar party in this manner
 firangi mahali or yasuub abbaas ne kaha ki iftaar party dena yaa nahin dena yah kisi kaa apana adhikaar he lekin aamantrit karke radd nahin kiya janaa chahie tha

 ye kahani he krime sho indiaj most wonted ke host suhaib eliyasi kii
 Those who were acquitted by the High Court on Friday giving great relief
 18 saal pahalesuhayb eliasiki patni anju eliyasi kii rahasyamayi haalat main maut ho gai thi
 After 17 years i
e
 on 20 December 2017, the Delhi lower court convicted Suhaib Ilyasi for the death of Anju and sentenced him to life imprisonment
 saath hi un par das lakh rupee kaa jurmaana bhi kiya tha
 But Suhayb moved the High Court against that decision
 jisamen sunwaayee ke baad unhen patni kii hatya ke aarope se mukt kar diya gaya
 As Suhayb used to identify the identity of the most wanted criminals of India, the same identity had become his own
 kisne sochaa hoga ki jo shaks ek jamaane main logon ko apane tivi sho ke jariye most wonted aparaadhiyon se rubaru karwaata tha
 Criminals used to tremble hands and feet as soon as they heard the 90s
 jisane aparaadhiyon kii neend uda rakhi thi
 His own name will one day be added to the same list of criminals
 jo 21veen sadi main paidaa hue wo bhale is shaks ko achche se na jaanate hon magar usase pehle paidaa hue logon ke liye ye shaks kisi pahchaan kaa mohataaj nahin
 As soon as his crime show tunes were played on TV at night, people understood that a gangster will be back again today
 magar vaqt kaa pahiyaa aisa ghumaa ki jo shaks aparaadhiyon ko unke asal thikaan tak pahunchaata tha, wo khud salaakhon ke peeche pahunch gaya
 That too in the murder of his own wife Anju Ilyasi
 magar 17 saal baad dilli kii kadakadduma court necrime shoindiyaaz most wonted ke ankar suhaib eliyasi ko apni hi bivi kii maut kaa doshi qaraar de diya tha
 The twists in this case of killing of Anju Ilyasi, is no less than a film story
 ye tha puraa maamalaye kahani shuru hui saal 2000 main
 The date was 10 January
 suhaib kii patni anju ilyaasi ko purvi dilli ke mayur vihaar ilaake ke ghar se zakhmi haalat main aspataal le jaaya gaya tha
 In a statement to the police, Suhayb said that after an altercation between the two, Anju stabbed herself with the intention of committing suicide
 vaardaat ke vaqt ghar main anju eliyasi ke alaava uski dhai saal kii beti aalia or khud suhaib eliyasi maujuud tha
 According to Suhayb, when he reached home, he had something to say to Anju
 jiske baad anju duusare kamare main chali gai or phir usne gusse me khud ko chaaku maar liya
 Anju had two knife marks on his stomach
 baad main aspataal main ilaaj ke dauraan anju eliyasi kii maut ho gai
 Now the whole issue had come to a stand on whether Anju really committed suicide or was he murdered? This question was arising because the experts were not ready to believe that a person committing suicide can strike himself more than once with a knife
 baad main postmortem report bhi is sawaal kaa jawaab dene main naakaam rahi
 a panel of three doctors conducted an autopsy of the body of Anju Ilyasi
 do-do atopsi reports taiyaar hui
 The results of the forensic investigation came out
 anju ke maa-baap ke bayaan darj hue
 Then everyone was pointing out that Anju had committed suicide
 police bhi ab isi theory par jaanch mukammal karne ja rahi thi
 On that night of 10 January 2000, Anju stabbed herself or someone else stabbed her after a fight with Nsuhaib Ilyasi? The post-mortem report was not able to shed any special light on the case and neither Anju's fingerprints were found on the knife nor that of Suhayb Ilyasi
 iske alaava ghar main koi chashmadid bhi nahin tha
 So initially everyone was accepting the same story that Suhayb was narrating
 magar tabhi maamle main twist tab aayaa jab anju ke katl ke ek maheene baad farvari main anju kii badi bahan rashmi canada se bharat ain
 Rashmi shocked everyone by revealing for the first time that Anju has not committed suicide but has been killed
 uske baad samay kaa pahiyaa ghumaa or shaq kii sui suhaib par jaakar tik gai
 Suhayb's troublesome journey had just started from there
 maamla police se hote hue adaalat tak ja pahunchaa
 17 years later, on 20 December 2017, the Karkardooma court in Delhi convicted Suhaib and sentenced him to life imprisonment
 lekin ab dilli hai court ne bada faisla dete hue suhaib ko patni ke katl ke iljaam se bari kar diya
 The High Court said that there is no evidence against Suhayb in this case

 She will only send lies wrapped in thoughts, propaganda, behavior, emotion, but the market must always know that lies cannot be traded

 Added to satisfy leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and others who supported the government's move on the backfoot, the Congress's CWC met Tuesday in a dilemma over the Modi government's bill ending most of the provisions of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 baithak main bhi netaaon main is mudde par mataiky najar nahin aayaa
 Ghulam Nabi Azad spoke on Kashmir for a long time
 duusari taraf modi sarkaar ke is faisle kaa samarthan karne vaale jyotiraditya sindhiya samet anya netaa baikfoot par najar aae
 Former party presidents Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi opposed the method of removing Article 370
 saath hi 370 par sidhe bolne se bache
 It was also seen that after direct opposition in the Rajya Sabha, the party first changed the line in the Lok Sabha and then in the CWC

 2- Jitin Prasad said that the environment of the country is in favor of BJP on this issue

 3- Jyotiraditya Scindia, who tweeted in favor of the Center's decision, fell alone
 unhone kaha ki public centement jo kah rahaa he, vahi maine twit kiya
 Although i disagree with the way the government works
 sindhiya kii baat ko gandhi parivaar samet kisi se koi samarthan nahin mila
 4- Dipendra Hooda also appeared to defend his tweet
 huda ne safai di ki pulavama ke baad bhi maine yahi kaha tha or phir tazaa twit kiya, lekin sarkaar kaa tarika sahi nahin ye bhi likhaa
 5- RPN Singh said- You can be technically right on Kashmir, but what did you bring to the public? What answer? Political aspects, not political aspects, should come out, about which we should go among the public
 6- rahul gandhi ne sabaki sunne ke baad kaha ki ham sach ke saath hai, lekin sirf public centement hi paimaana nahin ho saktaa
 7- Chidambaram said that if tomorrow Hindi is made compulsory in Tamil Nadu as per public sentiment? Can i do this? Can we forget the old promises? 8- Priyanka also nodded yes to Rahul and said that the government made a mockery of democracy on this issue
 is mudde par sonia, rahul, priyanka ekajute najar aae
 9 - Separate paragraph on POK added to CWC proposal
 yah sindhiya, kuldeep vishnoi, deependra hooda, arpyen singh or jitin prasad kii baton ke kaaran hua
 It was clarified in the proposal that not only Kashmir, pok is also ours
 yah dwipaksheeya masalaa he or is par kisi tisare kii madhyasthata manjuur nahin he
 10- Why did Nehru, Patel, Ambedkar implement 370 in the end? It was also discussed, but the resolution was passed silently on the issue of removing 370 and disagreed with the manner of the government

 Kejriwal alleged that Modi is "lying" on the issue of 'one rank, one pension' (OROP) scheme that the scheme has been implemented and said that if the Central Government had been implementing the scheme then ex-soldier Ram Kishan Grewal would not have committed suicide
 tippaniyan The AAP leader said in his Twitter message, 'both farmers and jawans are committing suicide in Modi Raj

 com (@theweddingbrigade) on Nov 21, 2018 at 6:48am PST i have seen some media is twisting my comments made in an interview
 Here is what i said - it may seem to some people that Mr Modi is stronger on terror but i think this is a poll gimmick more than anything else
 
 bataa den ki ek intervyuu main shila dikshit (sheila Dikshit) ne kaha tha ki aatank ke khilaaf purv piem manmohan singh (manmohan Singh) kaa rukh narendra modi (narendra Modi) jitna kadaa nahin tha
 Delhi Congress chief Sheila Dikshit had said that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's 'response' after the 26 / 11 Mumbai terror attacks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi (pulwama Terror Attack) after the Pulwama Terror Attack
 Was not 'strong and firm'
 haalanki iske saath hi shila dikshit(sheila Dikshit) ne yah bhi kaha he ki narendra modi ke zyaadaatar kaam raajnneeti se prerit hone ke saath hi raajnneetik laabh uthaane ke liye hote hai
 Sheila Dikshit said during an interview, 'look, i agree that Manmohan Singh was not as strict as he (modi) is, but i think he can do all this by being politically motivated

 On the other hand, Sheila Dixit's statement was fiercely attacked by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 unhone kaha, 'shila ji kaa ye bayaan vaaki chaunkaane vaala he
 Khichdi is cooking in BJP and Congress
 'udhar, dilli ke up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne shila dikshit ke bayaan par kaha he ki, 'ham to pehle se hi kah rahe the ki is baar congress modi ji ko dobaaraa piem banane ke liye kaam kar rahi he

 An official at the National Zoological Park said, 'A similar incident took place 6 years ago
 nashe main dhutt yuvak sherni ke aage kud padaa tha
 But luckily the lioness spared her life
 ’adhikari ne kaha ki sherni ne kaaphi der tak yuvak ko gaur se dekha, lekin usapar hamalaa nahin kiya
 The official said, "precautionary steps were taken at that time and the lioness was somehow sent inside the cage

 It is said that keeping tiger nails or teeth does not hurt at home
 sher ke nakhun kaa taabeej banaakar gale main pahanane se dar nahin lagata
 In the international market, its skin and bones face a price tag
 beshak kaaran koi bhi ho saktaa he
 But it is so clear that these reasons are enough to keep the tiger on the target of the poachers
 isi ke maddenjar desh bhar main baaghon ko bachaane ke liye jahaan bade str par prayaas kiye ja rahe hai, vahiin chhattisgarh ke rajanandgaanv jile ke chhuria ilaake main van adhikariyon ke saamne ek baghin ko badi berahami se maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 This incident was carried out at a time when the tiger was wiped out from Panna Tiger Reserve in the neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh
 ahm yah ki samasya kaa samaadhaan talashne ke bajaae sabhi vibhaag asafalataa kaa thikra ek-duusare ke sir phodne main vyast hai
 On September 24, a new incident in the story of this plight of tigers was linked to Churia area of chhattisgarh where a tigress had wandered from Maharashtra about one and a half months ago
 shanivaar tadake bakharutolaa ke ek gramin ne baghin ko dekha to usne or logon ko bataa diya
 Over 5,000 people gathered from nearby villages
 lathi, danda, farsa liye logon ne baghin ko ek khet main gher liya
 From eight o'clock in the morning to half past one in the afternoon, the villagers kept running the tigress here and there
 bataaya jaataa he ki sherni ko graminon dwaara gherne kii jaankaree subah aath baje van vibhaag ko de di gai thi
 Rescuers arrived at 1 pm after five hours carrying nets and tranquilizers
 team ke paas vanyajeevon ke prashikshit doctor bhi nahin the
 The doctor, who came on deputation from the animal husbandry department, did not let the unconscious tranquilizer gun be fired
 doctor kaa kahana tha ki pehle jaal main fansaao tab trenculizer kaa upyog kiya jayega jabaki, vanya praani visheshgy kehete hai ki sher jaise jaanavar ko pakadaney ke liye sabase pehle isi kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 As the tigress fell into the trap, hundreds of people with sticks, sticks, stones and stones broke on her
 logon ke gusse ke aage van or police kaa amala kuch nahin kar paaya
 The tigress died shortly after
 kisi ne uski poonch kaat daali to koi uske daant or moonchhen ukhaad le gaya
 The villagers also took out a procession after killing the tigress
 graminon ko andeh tha ki baghin ne ek mahila ko shikaar banane ke saath-saath ek darjan se zyada maweshiyon ko maaraa tha
 After the incident, the Forest Department is now busting the head of the police
 van mantri vikram usendi kehete hai, ''bheed ke aage van vibhaag kaa amala bebas tha
 Angry villagers could be controlled if they could get help from the police
 ''jabaki grih mantri nanakiram kanvar kehete hai, ''sher pakadana van vibhaag kaa kaam he

 Even then, the forest officer and the force would have made arrangements for it

 haalanki, van vibhaag rajya main 22 se 25 baagh hone kaa daawa karata he
 But wildlife experts say, the number of tigers will also be half of it
 yahi nahin, raipur jile ke hi baranwapaara abhayaarany main shikariyon ne karant lagaakar ek tendue ko maar daalaa
 On 27 September, a woman who picked up wood saw the leopard's body and informed the forest department employees
 shikariyon ne tendue ke daant, moonch or nakhun nikaal liye the
 Detected in the post mortem, the leopard was killed two days earlier
 udhar, padosi rajya madhya pradesh par najar daalen to yahaan ke tiger rigerv rashtriya pashu baagh ke liye ab pehle jaise surakshit ashiyane nahin rahe
 Especially the Panna Tiger Reserve is poised to become the second Sariska of the country due to the disappearing tigers
 panna tiger rigerv ke nideshak shrinivas murti ne rajya sarkaar ke van vibhaag ko janvari 2011 main ek report bheji thi
 According to him, 19 tigers were hunted here over a period of 20 years (1990 to 2010)
 isamen se chah baagh 2005 main maare gaye the
 The victim was found in the Chandranagar range of the Panna Tiger Reserve, but the Forest Department officials did not show any interest in any action, rather the staff there managed to erase the evidence
 nideshak murti kii report bataati he ki shikari jatiyon, baheliya or pardi samudaay ke log ab bhi shikaar main lipt hai or ye log bandook se lekar vanya praaniyon ko jehar dene, fanda banaakar or shikanje main fansane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife) Dr
 ech
 s
 pabala ne bhi isi avadhi main ek report bheji thi
 This report emphasizes that tigers have been killed due to the high number of male tigers in the tiger reserve and the battle for supremacy among them
 da
 Calling the report of Pabla Murthy wrong, it is said that Murthy, the director of Panna Tiger Reserve, took out cases that were 20 years old
 usamen unhen aisa laga ki baaghon kii hatya hui he
 There have been some hunting cases, but the bones of the bear were recovered, not the tiger
 agar taaja aankadon ko dekhen to pradesh ke tiger rigerv se 49 baagh gaayab ho chuke hai
 Of this, the biggest loss has been in Panna Tiger Reserve, from where all 35 tigers are believed to be missing
 yah bilkul vaisaa hi he jaisaa rajasthan ke sariska tiger rigerv main hua tha, jahaan se baaghon kii sari aabaadi hi gaayab ho gai thi or puure maamle kii sibiai jaanch hui, jisamen yah tathy saamne aayaa ki shikaar ke chalate baagh gaayab hue
 Dr
 pabala kuch bhi kahen, lekin panna tiger rigerv main kuprabandhan ke chalate hi baagh gaayab hue
 Several agencies had also warned earlier about the disappearance of tigers
 centre sarkaar ne ek vishesh jaanch team banaai or usne bhi yahi kaha ki baagh prakritik kaarnon se nahin, balki shikaar ke chalate gaayab hue hai
 Officials of the State Forest Department are not satisfied with this report and are considering the cause of death of tigers as natural
 sabhi tathyon ke saamne aane ke baad bhi rajya kaa van vibhaag sibiai se jaanch karaane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Five months ago, when the then Forest and Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh visited the Panna Tiger Reserve, he also expressed regret over not conducting a CBI inquiry
 is maamle main ab praytn sanstha dwaara pahal kii ja rahi he or vah sibiai jaanch ke maamle ko lekar supreme court jane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 On the other hand, the forest department is also trying to increase the tiger pool in Panna Tiger Reserve
 kanha or bandhavgarh tiger rigerv se teen maadaa or ek nar baagh ko yahaan laayaa gaya he
 With this, a total of ten tigers, including four tiger cubs, are being claimed here
 lekin rajya sarkaar ke panna ko bafer jone adhishuchet karne main deree karne se baaghon ke astitv ko khatra bana hi hua he
 The number of tigers in Kanha Tiger Reserve has also come down from 89 to 64
 rajya ke van vibhaag ne in aankadon par andeh jataayaa or phir se gananaa karai he
 In such a situation, the question is exactly where the emerald tigers disappeared and these tigers are being resettled here, but why are there no strong arrangements being made to save them
 agar yahi dhul-mul ravaiya rahaa to isamen koi shubahaa nahin ki nae basaae gaye baagh bhi jald gaayab ho jaaen

 ) Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan will remain or be removed from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the decision is now 8 days left
 charchaae hai ki 28 march ko hone vaali party kii neshnal council kii baithak mendonon netaaon ko nikaale jane par faislalia ja saktaa he
 Before the meeting, the process of lobbying in favor and opposition in the party is also going on
 lekin is artical ke lekhak ko lagata he ki AAP ko in donon netaaon ko apane saath banaae rakhana chahie, isse use sabase kam nuksaan hoga
 Here are five reasons for not removing Yogendra and Prashant from the party: 1
 party kaa canvas bada karte hai dononyogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan aam aadmi party ke un netaaon main se hai jo vichaar, balki sidhe kaha jaae to vichaardhaara se sidhaa judaav mahasoos karte hai
 Yogendra is of Gandhian temperament and has been in the Socialist People's Council
 vahiin prashanth kaa raajnneetik rujhaan vam kii ore mana jaataa he
 By maintaining both, there is a balance of equal-based politics and ideology in the party, which always works in the party's favor
 saath hi, isse party kaa canvas or samarthakon kaa dayera bhi bada hota he
 At the level of the mass base, even though the Left may appear looted, many people agreeing with the left view are still playing a useful role for the AAP
 kuch jhaadu ke tikat par loksabhaa chunaav lard chuke hai to kuch baahar se hi hamadardi rakhte hai
 In the current situation, yogendra-prashant's departure will also lose their support
 aisa nahin he ki isse party kisi kathith 'communal' chhavi kii ore bad chalegi, lekin phir bhi secular raajnneeti ke himachati isse rusht jarur honge
 There may be a flurry of resignations in the party
 2
 Yogendra would be a useful spokesperson, losing Yogendra Yadav to successful safologist AAP would be a useful person to lose
 vah desh ke sabase pratishthit safologist main se ek hai or behad vinamr or shandaar pravaktaa hai
 His comfortable, gentle, calm and patient personality continues to benefit the party
 jis tarah se vah samachar channelon par bolte hai, unki style par kai AAP samarthak mugdh hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party also benefited greatly from his ability in the recent Delhi elections
 vah ranneetikaron main shaamil the, har vidhansabha seat par party kii sthiti par surveykshan kar rahe the or saath hi media main party kaa paksh majbootee se rakh rahe the
 Even when all exit polls were giving majority to the party, he was adamant that his seats were still less visible
 unke akalan kaa soshal media par majaak udaaya gaya, lekin ant main vah sach ke kaaphi kareeb sabit hua
 Yogendra also held a number of rallies in this election and his presence in some seats had a fair effect
 haryana main party ke vah sabase bade netaa hai or party main unhen bhavi mukhyamantri ke taur par bhi dekha jaataa rahaa he
 Haryana may be the next fertile land for the AAP, but with Yogendra's departure, the prospective farmer can take away that land from the AAP
 3
 Prashant Bhushan, Crusader Against Corruption This also applies to Prashant Bhushan
 kaagajon ke aadhaar par baat karen to aam aadmi party main karpshan ke khilaaf sabase bade nayak kejariwal nahin, prashanth bhushan hai
 He is always busy in searching for something and keeps petitions on important issues
 unki yah style aam aadmi party ke taur-tareekon se kaaphi mail khaati he
 Through his advocacy ventures, he has uncovered many big scams
 purv sibiai diarector ranjit sinha 2ji cese kii jaanch karte hue aropiyon se mil rahe the, yah daawa karke unhone hadakamp machaa diya tha
 Whether to gather documents or explain any government-technical or court order to surround the opposition, he is a trump card for the party in every sense
 swabhaav se vinamr or saarvajanik jivan bhi bedaag
 Except for his disputed statement on Kashmir, his image in the public is also good
 unke jane se unki yachikaaon ke sakaaratmak asar kaa shrey kabhi AAP kii jholii main nahin daalaa ja sakegaa
 4
 nandak niyare raakhieyogendra or prashanth ne party ko khadaa karne main ahm role nibhaayaa he
 Yokendra's face was plastered with ink and he slept in the police station while performing to get Kejriwal released
 prashanth bhushan ne kashmir mudde par apni 'vivaadit' lekin bebaak raay khulkar saamne rakhi
 Yogendra is also not hesitant to admit the party's shortcomings on public occasions
 kul milakar, donon kii chhavi se aisa lagata he ki party ke bheetar ve janapaksheeya muddon par hameshaa prakhar rahenge or asahmatiyon ko vyakt karenge
 Also, he will always be useful as a critic on inner and outer issues
 ek party jo paardarshita ko ahm siddhant banaakar khadi hui he, use aantarik matbhedon se asuraksha nahin honi chahie
 5
 ab damege control jaruri heparty ke shubhachintak or kaaryakarta unhen baahar kiye jane se naaraaz hai
 Activists feel that by asking the public in 2013, the government-makers are now hesitant to seek the opinion of their workers
 kaaryakartaaon ke liye aaj bhi kejariwal hi sabase bade netaa hai, lekin yogendra or prashanth ko jis tareeke se bedakhal kiya ja rahe, vah kisi ko hajam nahin ho rahaa
 NRI supporters, especially those who have been giving a lot of donations to the party, are angry with this
 'kejariwal brigade' ko lekar kaaryakartaaon kii raay bahut acchhee nahin he
 Even if it looks like spitting and licking, the only way for the AAP to save its credibility is to keep Yogendra and Prashant in the party
 isse use sabase kam nuksaan hoga
 Before the Bihar elections, there has been an intensified period of rhetoric of politicians
 saansad rajesh ranjan urf pappu yadav ne apni party kaa ghoshnaptr jari karte ek vivaadaaspad bayaan de diya
 Pappu Yadav has promised in the manifesto that TV sets will be given to families living below the poverty line
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main pappu ne is elaan ko jaij qaraar diya he
 He said, 'the poor only have a wife for entertainment, so i am giving TV
 'baharhaal, pappu yadav ke bayaan par bavaal machana tay he
 It is understood that political parties can also visit the Election Commission against the ideal code of conduct against Pappu Yadav's manifesto
 gauratlab he ki pappu yadav nejan adhikaar morcha naam se partibanaai he
 For the Bihar elections, the Jan Adhikar Morcha, Samajwadi Party, NCP, Samaras Samaj Party, Samajwadi Janata Dal and National People's Party have formed a third front

 " In support of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's Rath Yatra, such posters are now appearing among the lakhs of posters in Lucknow city where Shivpal is also blessing his nephew Akhilesh to become the Chief Minister again
 ye poster logon ko chaukaa rahe he
 Separate socialist Yuvjan Sabha did not want to see Shivpal put up such a poster which said, 'shivpal Dil Se, Akhilesh's Abhishek again'
 saaf he ab is mode par jab party or kaaryakarta akhilesh ke saath khadey ho rahe hai, to shivpal alag-thalag dikhnaa nahin chaahate
 Akhilesh had become anti-image This battle of posters of Akhilesh's Samajwadi Yatra in Lucknow for the last several days showed that Shivpal Yadav has been alone in this
 3 november kii samaajawaadee yatra kii taiyaariyon main shivpal na sirf alag-thalag dikhaai die balki unki chhavi akhilesh virdohi tak kii ban gai
 In such a situation, his supporters found this way and put up such posters that now uncle is also with him
 is poster main shivpal kii kitni sahmati he ye kahana to mushkil he lekin ab shivpal ke samarthak kaam se kam alag-thalag dikhnaa nahin chaahate, ye saaf hota ja rahaa he
 This journey is important for Akhilesh, this Samajwadi Vikas Yatra for Akhilesh is related to his self-respect and his supremacy over the party
 saath hi phir se sarkaar banane ke akhilesh kii akeli koshish kaa pradarshan bhi he, aise main akhilesh apane puure bhavy pradarshan ke saath apni yatra shuru kar rahe he
 With Shivpal's absence in the yatra, the eyes of the Kayasabas are also fixed on whether or not they come with Mulayam in Kishivpalakal's rath yatra
 sutron ke mutabik agar akhilesh yaa mulaayam nimantran de to shivpal bhi mulaayam ke saath yatra ko hari jhandi dikhaate vakt manch par maujuud ho sakate hai
 Wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha of the Indian team made a great catch in the first Test match in Pune on Thursday by Australia's lower order batsman Steve o'keefe in the air behind the wicket

 The victim became friends with the accused through Facebook
 pyaar kaa naatak kar usne peedita se uske ashleel photo bhi mangavaaye
 After this, he made physical relations with her by pretending to marry
 peedita kii shikaayat par police ne aaropee ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The name of the accused is Sudarshan Kamble
 usne aryan saavant naam se fasebuk par farji idi banaai thi
 Through Facebook, he befriended 17-year-old Seema (name changed)
 dekhte hi dekhte dosti pyaar main badal gai or donon aksar milane lage
 Seema was unaware of Sudarshan's intentions
 sudarshan ne ek din seemaa se uskinude photomangi
 Seema refuses, but she is helpless before love
 seemaa ne use apni kuch neude tasviren bhej di
 After this, Sudarshan made sexual relations with the victim by convincing her to get married and secretly recorded a video of it

 supreme court ne apane faisle main 1991 main bane ek kanoon kaa kiya zikrais act se ram janmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad ko baahar rakhaa gaya tharam janmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad par shanivaar kosupreme court kaa aitihaasik faisla chukaa he
 This dispute was going on in Ayodhya for centuries
 chif justise ranjan gogoi kii aguwai main paanch jajon kii sanvaidhanik peeth ne faisla sunaate hue vivaadit jameen ramalala virajman ko saunp di he
 Whereas, the court has ordered 5 acres of land in Ayodhya for Muslim party Sunni Waff Board
 supreme court ne faisle main kiya special varship provision act kaa zikrais faisle ke saath hi supreme court kii is bench ne desh ke tamaam vivaadit dharmasthalon par bhi apana rukh spasht kar diya he
 Significantly, the Supreme Court in its 1,045-page judgment has also mentioned the Places of Worship (special Provisions) Act, 1991, which came into force on 11 July 1991
 yani sheersh adaalat ne is baat kaa spasht sandesh de diya he ki kaashi or mathura main jo maujuuda sthiti he vahi bani rahegi usamen kisi bhi tarah ke badlaav kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 The Supreme Court said, this law reinforces the values of the Constitution Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice S
 e
 Bobde, Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice S
K
 abdul nazeer kii peeth ne apane faisle main desh ke secular charitra kii baat kii thi
 The court said in its judgment that this 1991 law reinforces the values of the Constitution in the country
 iske alaava peeth ne desh kii aazaadee ke dauraan maujuud dharmik sthalon ke jas ke tas sangrakshan par bhi jor diya tha
 The bench said, "the country has taken the initiative to strengthen the constitutional commitment by implementing this Act and to treat all religions as equal and to maintain secularism
" "kyon bana tha yah ectsaal 1991 main centre main narsimha raav kii sarkaar thi
 The Rao government had feared something similar to the Babri demolition in Ayodhya a year earlier
 jaahir he us vakt vivaad sirf ayodhya ko lekar hi nahin tha,kaashi or mathura jaise kai dharmik sthal bhi the jinaki sthiti kaaphi had tak ayodhya jaisi thi
 At that time (in 1991) a law was passed to avoid anything like the Babri demolition at any religious place
 usee kanoon kaa naam tha plases of varship (special provision) act, 1991
 What it says is the essence of what was said in the Acts of Worship (special Provisions) Act, 1991, but this one line put an end to a lot of controversies
 is act main is baat kaa spasht ullekh tha ki 15 agast, 1947 ko jo dharmik sthal jis sampradaay kaa tha wo aaj, or bhavishya main, bhi usee kaa rahegaa
 Ayodhya dispute was excluded, let me also tell you that even though this act was brought due to the Ayodhya dispute, the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute was excluded from this act because till then this dispute was removed from the politics of the country to the public
 reached
 ek muslim sanghathan kar chukaa he is act kaa virodhkuch maheenon pehle 2018 main is act kaa virodh ek muslim sanghathan kar chukaa he
 That organization believed that because of this we would not be able to give the site to the Hindus, which we wanted to give
 bataa den ki shiya central board ke chairman wasim rizvi ne kaha tha ki 'special varship provision act' ke tahat, chunki vivaadit masjiden surakshit kii ja chuki hai or chunki unhen hinduon ko saunpane main mushkil hogi, isliye ise khatm kar diya jaae
 Along with this, Wasim Rizvi had also demanded that a special committee should be gathered under the supervision of the court to get accurate information about the disputed mosques and if it is proved that they have been built by breaking the shrines of Hindus
 They should be returned to the Hindus

 pragatisheel samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya shivpal singh yadav ne shanivaar ko itawa main kaha ki vah janata kii maang par loksabhaa chunaav firozabad se ladenge
 He claimed that no party could form a government after the election without the Progressive Samajwadi Party at the Center
 shivpal ne itawa ke dhanuankheda inter kalege main ganatantr diwas par ek samaaroh ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki lakhanu main lakhon logon ke bich hamane kaha tha ki mujhe kuch nahin chahie, na mantri pad na kuch or, sirf sammaan chahie
 But they were conspired and separated from the party
 bhattije akhilesh yadav par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki unhen dhokhaa diya gaya or majaburi main unhen pragatisheel samaajawaadee party kaa gathan karnaa padaa
 Shivpal said on the SP-BSP alliance that the BSP gave a blow to the SP and formed the government with the support of the BJP three times
 unhone kaha ki mulaayam singh ko ‘‘gunda'', sapa ko gundon kii parties tathaa unhen duraachaari bataane vaale dal ke saath gathbandhan pita or chachaa kaa saaf apmaan he
 UP BJP President Keshav Prasad Maurya says that the party could not find a single Muslim worker whom he would have won if he had given the ticket
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main maury ne yah baat kahi
 He questioned Mayawati and asked why she cut the ticket of Dalits and gave it to the Muslims
 unhone kaha ki bijepi sarkaar main ai to sirf akhilesh ke 5 saal kii hi nahin balki mayawati ke paanch saal or mulaayam singh ke kaarykaal 14 saal ke bhrashtachar kii jaanch karaayegi
 Here are the excerpts of this exclusive interview - almost half of the elections have been out, what is the bjp's assessment? In the first phase, the vote percentage is quite high, we are winning
 
 
 baari matdaan bijepi ke paksh main he, ye bijepi ke liye shubh sanket
 
 
 People have denied the casteist landfills
 
 
 log sushasan vaali sarkaar chaahate hai
 You have tried to polarize the voters
 
 
 hamane dhruvikaran kii koi koshish nahin kii he, ham to sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas kii baat karte hai
 The Modi government has implemented its plans with Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas
 
 
 dekhie akhilesh sarkaar muslim betiyon ke inter paas karne par 30 hajaar rupye detii he, lekin hindu betiyon ke liye kuch nahin, lekin bagal ke madhya pradesh main dekhie ham is tarah kii yojanaayen bina bhedbhaav lagu karte he
 
 
 There is the slogan beti-beti be the same Hindu or Muslim
 
 
 aapane musalamaanon ko tikat nahin diya, kya aapako musalamaanon ke vot kii jarurat nahi he yaa aap chaahate hai ki musalmaan aapako vot na den, taaki chunaav polaraise ho jaae, tab aap jeetenge ?dekhie agar ham musalmaan ko de den tikat, tab hamen secular mana jayega, to aisa secularavaad bhaajapa ko nahin chahie
 The BJP will give tickets to the one who will be able to win, will come in the party's survey, the consent of the worker
 upi main hamen ek bhi aisa kaaryakarta nahin mila jise ham tikat dete to wo jeet jaataa
 My question to Mayawati is why did she give tickets to Muslims by cutting the ticket of Dalits
 
 
 meraa sawaal akhilesh se he ki unhone kitne daliton-pichhadon kaa tikat katkar musalamaanon ko diya
 
 
 Both of them should tell us what percentage of the population of Muslims, how much they are entitled to, who were given so many tickets
 yah jawaab unako dena padegaa
 We do not have a worker, when we will fight
 upi se koi saansad nahin jitkar gaya, lekin hamane mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ko rajyasabha bheja
 
 
 Sent MJ Akbar to Rajya Sabha
 
 
 dono ko mantri banaaya
 
 
 No Muslim went after winning, but we made
 
 
 jabaab unako dena chahie jinhone pichhadon or daliton ke tikat katkar keval tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ke kaaran unako diya he jo kattarpanthi the, unhe diya he jo dange ke aaropee the
 You will see true Ramrajya in BJP government
 aap ram rajya kii baat kar rahe hai
 
 aapaki party ke netaa kah rahe he ki sarkaar banegi or ram mandir banegaa
 
 
 We made it clear in our manifesto that after the formation of the government, the obstacles of the temple will be overcome soon
 koi time frem nahin he
 In western UP, you have created an issue of anti-romeo squads and mechanical slaughterhouses, but in eastern UP this is not your issue
 
 
 aisa nahin he dekhie dudharu pashuon ke gardan par churi chalati rahegi, to aane vaali pidiyon ke bachche khun pienge, doodh to nahin milegaa
 
 
 If slaughter is required then such slaughterhouses should be banned
 
 
 upi main mahilaon ke prati aparaadh kaa graph badha he, do-do rape ke aaropee akhilesh sarkaar main mantri he or akhilesh ke rahete unki giraftaar nahin hui kitni chintaa kii baat he
 
 
 When the Supreme Court ordered against Gayatri, an order was made to write the report
 gayatri ke bare jab supreme court ko bolnaa pade to supreme court ke halaat aap samaj sakate hai
 The suffering people of UP were not heard in this government
 piem kii bhashaa par sawaal uth rahe hai
 
 
 'UP has adopted me' a lot of questions are being raised on this
 
 
 piem ne jis din yah kaha ki main upi kaa god liya betaa hum, tab se puraa pradesh gadgad he
 Who is a MP from UP, wants to develop a deep relationship with UP, then it is a big deal
 modi ji desh ke bete hai, pradesh ke bete hai, wo puure desh ko apana parivaar maanate hai
 The PM has touched up's heart by doing such a thing and others are building a wall which the people of UP are collapsing
 aap kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii baat sirf apni hi sarkaar banane par maaf karne par kyon kah rahe hai aap chaahate to akhilesh sarkaar main bhi ye elaan kar sakate the
 
 
 See, in the first meeting of the cabinet, we will forgive the loans of small and medium farmers, because the situation is bad
 main bhi kisaan kaa betaa hum, kisaan kii pidaa ko samajhataa hum
 At the moment, we will forgive the entire loan, but if a farmer takes a loan in future, he will not have to pay interest, only he will have to repay the loan, not the interest
 aap akhilesh sarkaar ko kos rahe hai, lekin akhilesh ke khilaaf koi personal anti inkambasi nahin dakhaai de rahi
 
 
 Akhilesh is a fraudulent chief minister in the name of development
 upi meghkhileshke khilaaf itnaa gussa he ki cycle kii hawa nikal chuki he
 You cannot guess how angry you are
 11 taarikh to jab maton kii ginati hogi tab oont pahaad ke neeche aayega
 By showing advertisements with the help of government money, development is showing, if we go to the land, there is neither road, no electricity, neither drinking water nor security
 satta main aane par aap kya jaanch karaayenge, kyonki akhilesh par ab tak koi daag nahin laga he
 
 
 Akhilesh Yadav is a completely tainted chief minister
 agar bharat sarkaar 14 karod rupye prati kimi sadak banaati he, to akhilesh jabaab den ki unhone 30 se 40 karod rupee main prati kimi kaise banaai
 Rs 100 crore per km metro is made in Noida, then how does Rs 200 crore per km in Lucknow
 akhilesh yadav ne naukariyaan bechi he
 Will you conduct an inquiry against Akhilesh? Not only Akhilesh's 5 years but Mayawati's five years and Akhilesh's father Mulayam Singh's tenure will also conduct a 14-year corruption inquiry and all who are guilty will be investigated by ministers, officers and contractors And they will get punished
 aap akhilesh ko jail bhejne kii baat karte hai, kya aisa karenge?doshi chaahe kitna bada hi kyon na ho ham use jail bhejenge
 Who has robbed the state and if proved to be robbers in the investigation, then punishment will be given
 kya lagata nahin ki pariwarik kalah ke baad akhilesh kii nai chhavi saamne ai or unhone sabhi daagi logon ko baahar kiya or ek nae akhilesh ke rup main saamne aae hai
 
 
 SP means Gundaraj, got the license to take possession of the land, got the right to sit in the police station and act with the will
 samaajawaadee party ke gunde, apradhi, mafia sapa chhodkar kahin nahin gaye hai
 He is sitting there
 janata unase trast he
 Akhilesh did not stop the culprits, but allowed the police to take action by looking at caste and religion
 ajam khan kaa rishtedaar he ki saifai waalon kaa rishtedaar, yah dekhakar sapa sarkaar main karrwai hui
 Due to this, the graph of crime has increased in the state
 bijepi main bahriyon kii bharmaar hui, aapane apane logon ko chhodkar baahar se aae logon ko tikat diya, kya aapako apane kaaryakartaaon par bharosa nahin tha ?hamane sabko tikat nahin die, 30-40 kaddavar logon ko ladaaya he jo chunaavon main vijayi hone ja rahe hai
 Those who were angry have persuaded, those who are still angry will take action against them
 bijepi kaa ek bhi kaaryakarta khilaaf main ladane waalon ke saath nahin gaya he
 There is no such thing as dissent in BJP, everyone has been persuaded
 bade netaaon ko said line kiya, varun gandhi ko istemaal nahin kiya gaya
 Many leaders were not even asked by the BJP
 kyon ?puraa kendriya or pradesh netritv laga he or sabko jo sammaan dena chahie vah sammaan diya gaya he
 In Purvanchal we are moving towards a big victory
 aapaki ladaai kisase he?yah mat pucho ki ham kisase lard rahe hai, balki haalat ye he sapa or basapa hamase lard rahi he, kahin basapa hamase lard rahi he to kahin sapa hamase lard rahi he
 Rahul and Akhilesh do not want to listen nor see
 ye sabha nahin kar paa rahe keval road sho kar rahe he taaki jam lag jaae, kuch raah chalati bheed aa jaaen
 The anger of the people is visible in the EVM on the day of voting
 mukhyamantri koun hoga, kya keshav prasad maury cheharaa honge?bijepi kaa mukhyanmatri bijepi kaa hi hoga, iskaa faisla chune hue vidhayak or kendriya netritv karegaa
 The face will be forward or backward
 We do not do this kind of politics, this BJP will decide who will be the CM
 aap res main hai
 
 
 i am in the election campaign as the President of BJP, trying to ensure victory for the people

 There is a lot of emphasis on emotion in this film

 Boycott said, 'I don't think he will play again
 mujhe aisa isaliye lagata he kyonki bhartiya team sahi disha main aage bad rahi he
 It took them some time to reach here
 unhone ab yuva khilaadiyon ko mauka diya he
 Sehwag 31 in eight Tests since April 2012
 38 ke ausat se keval 408 ran hi bana sake hai jisamen 117 ran sarvshereshth the
 During this, he made 30 in six odis
 5 ke ausat se 183 ran banaaye the or england ke khilaaf vanade shrinkhalaa ke liye unhen team se baahar kar diya gaya tha
 Sehwag scored a century in odis by scoring a double century against the West Indies in December 2011
 bykaat ne kaha ki bharat ne rashtriya team main yuva khilaadiyon ko shaamil karke sahi cheez kii he
 He said, 'after losing to England, i was constantly saying that you should give these young batsmen a chance

 ’bykaat ne kaha ki sahvaag pichley 20 varshon ke sarvshereshth ballebaajon main se ek hai or rakshaatmak takanic hi unki ekmaatr khami he
 He said, 'he plays in his own way and has sometimes been quite successful on some pitches
 lekin jab gend zyada move karti he or isamen zyada oochaal hota he to uski rakshaatmak takanic kaa khulaasa ho jaataa he
 But Sehwag has scored runs playing his way
 ’ How the regime changes as soon as the power changes, action on slaughterhouses makes it clear
 pichley varsh april main neshnal green tribunel (engiti) ne jab rajya pradooshan niyantran board se soobe main chal rahe bujadkhaanon kaa byoraa talab kiya to chaunkaane vaali baat saamne ai thi
 The Pollution Control Board had told the NGT that only one of the 126 slaughterhouses operating in the state was allowed to operate
 engiti ke sakht rukh ke baad pradooshan niyantran board ne fouran sabhi avaidh bujadkhaanon par karrwai karne kaa aadesh diya lekin adhikari is par kundali maar kar baith gaye
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seized this issue and made a loud promise to close all mechanical abattoirs as soon as the government was formed
 19 march ko yogi aditya nath ke netritv main bhaajapa kii sarkaar ne jaise hi satta sanbhali, adhikari avaidh bujadkhaanon par karrwai ke liye nikal pade
 More than four dozen abattoirs were sealed within 48 hours by campaigning across the state
 prashasan kii karrwai ke baad elahabaad, meerut, kanpur main log virodh main utar aae
 Now the real challenge of the BJP government is to shut down the mechanical abattoirs that it has promised in its election manifesto
 soobe main kul 44 yantric (maikenical) bujadkaane hai jo sthaneey nikaay ke kanoonon ke anusaar sanchalit hai
 Two thousand crore rupees every year from them
 kaa maance videshon ko bheja jaataa he
 "mechanical abattoirs are operated according to the Corporation Act," says Yakub Qureshi, who runs a mechanical abattoir in Meerut
 inhen kisi ke aadesh se band nahin kiya ja saktaa
 "the challenge before the BJP government is also the 15,000 workers who are facing the risk of becoming unemployed after hanging locks at slaughterhouses
 in chunautiyon kaa abhas mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko bhi tha jab 20 march kii dopaher teen baje mukhyamantri karyaalay main unhone adhikariyon ke saath pehali baithak kii

 On February 13, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the debt waiver at an election rally in Lakhimpur that the debt of farmers will be waived in the first cabinet meeting when the BJP government is formed in the state

 "it is a matter of relief for the BJP government that the central government is ready to help the state on debt waiver of farmers

 Arvind Mohan says, "the debt waiver will not do any good to the farmers
 sarkaar kisaanon kii upaj ko bazaar muhaiyaa karakar unki aamadani badaye taaki ve apana karj swayan chukaa saken

 In the bank account of Rani during the last one year, six thousand rupees

 After the change of power in UP, the future of those schemes which were started by the Samajwadi Party (SP) government under the name Samajwadi, hangs in the balance

 Many projects like Metro, Gomti River Front in Lucknow, JP Center, IT City, Elevated Highway being built in Ghaziabad are lagging behind schedule
 purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne apni chunavi reliyon main agra-lakhanu express ve kaa zikr kar apni sarkaar kii vikaas yojanaon kaa purajor prachaar kiya tha
 The investigation into allegations of corruption related to this expressway passing through 10 districts including Samajwadi Party strongholds like Mainpuri, Kannauj, Etawah, Firozabad is a challenge for the Yogi government
 yah expresve kul 60 vidhansabha kshetron se hokar gujarata he, jisamen sapa ne keval 10 or bijepi ne 48 siten jiti hai
 a senior cabinet minister in the BJP government says, "the government can set up a commission to investigate corruption in construction works during the SP government, which will have to submit its report within the stipulated deadline
" "kaise puraa hoga har ghar bijli kaa sapanavidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav aamane-saamne aa gaye the
 In his election rallies, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accused the SP government that the temples do not get electricity while the dargahs get 24 hours of electricity
 akhilesh ne bhi yogi ko chunauti dete hue kaha tha ki baba kisi bijli ke taar ko pakadakar dikhaaen taaki pataa chale ki bijli aa rahi he ki nahin
 Now after the formation of BJP government in the state, Adityanath's biggest challenge is to provide electricity to every house before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bhaajapa ke is chunavi lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye upi ko do varsh baad 22,000 megawatt bijli kii jarurat padegi
 For this, apart from providing additional power, the distribution network will also have to be repaired
 ''ol india power ejeeniyarrs federation" ke chairman shailendra dube kehete hai, ''do varsh ke bheetar har ghar main bijli pahunchane ke liye sarkaar ko ek karod se zyada nae conection dene kii chunauti he
 Apart from this, a large number of small sub-stations and lines will also have to be built to improve the transmission system
 "to repair the electricity distribution network in the state, the state government has to pay at least Rs 10,000 crore
 ke nivesh kii jarurat hogi
 Former Chief Engineer of Electricity Department O

 bijepi ke senior netaa or purv vitt mantri yashavanth sinha ne modi sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 He has directly hurt the economic decisions taken by the government
 yashavanth sinha kaa kahana he ki agar desh hit main koi galat kadam uthaae jate hai to uske khilaaf wo chup nahin baithenge
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Yashwant Sinha raised 10 such issues which are directly against the Modi government
 aise main sarkaar ko in sawaalon kaa jawaab dena baari pad sakati he
 1
 vitt mantri arun jetali vitt mantralay ko vakt nahin de paa rahe hai
 Because of which the government is slipping on the economic front
 2
 In today's era, many leaders disagree with the government's decision, but they are not able to openly oppose the party
 3
 The rate of economic growth is falling
 pichley dinon ai GDP ke aankade chintaa kaa vishay he
 i never said to remove Jaitley
 4
 The country is moving towards poverty
 pichley dedh saal main aarthik vikaas kii raftaar patari se utari he
 Only a financially strong country can be self-reliant
 5
 It is not necessary that Jayant Sinha and my views are the same
 donon ek parivaar kaa hissaa hai, pita-putr kaa rishta nijee he sarkari nahin
 6
 1947 ke baad se hi desh main aarthik sudhaar kii disha main kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 'new India' is the slogan of the Modi government
 7
 Despite wrong economic decisions, winning elections is a different matter and running a government is a different issue
 8
 PM Modi has closely observed many economic reforms, when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he took big economic decisions
 isliye unhen dosha dena galat he
 9
 RSS ke dwaara bhi ab nitiyon main teji se badlaav laayaa ja rahaa he
 In our era, the role of RSS in the government was different and is different now
 10
 If the Modi government is to return to power again in 2019, it is most important to bring the economy back on track and employment creation will have to be focused on fast

 Today, some of the best talents of the country are partnering with me and are working to solve the problems that have been eating up this country's affordable budget hospitality sector for centuries
 jo udhyami sarthak tareeke se kisi samaj ko hal karne main yakeen rakhte hai, unke liye bharat main kaaphi sambhaavnaaen hai
 Today more and more people are leaving their 9 to 5 jobs and starting businesses which can bring real change in people's lives
 isse arthvyavastha ko ek se zyada tareekon se phayda pahunchataa he—ek udhyami jahaan apane kaushal kaa istemaal kisi samasya ko hal karne yaa koi utpaada banane main laga saktaa he or usase apni aajeevika chalaa saktaa he, vahiin duusari ore vah samudaay ke duusare sadasyon ke liye paryaapt rojgaar ke avasar bhi srujit kar saktaa he
 To succeed or to help the economy grow, you do not have to build a company with several billion
 vastav main chote dhandhe arthvyavastha main rojgaar ke ingine kii bhoomika nibhaate hai
 As far as the company's ability to generate employment is concerned, the size or oldness of the business does not matter much
 nai or yuva companiyaan hi aaj rojgaron kaa pehla pravesh dwaar ban rahi hai
 The increasing penetration of smartphones in the hinterland of India and the investment of retailers are contributing to the fast pace of mobile commerce in the country
 oyo kii aadhe se zyada booking mobile ap se aa rahi he
 By creating employment, we can empower the deprived sections of the country and help transform India
 sahi rojgaron ko paidaa karnaa bhi ek sehatmand arthvyavastha ke liye utana hi jaruri he
 There is a serious lack of training in the non-branded hospitality sector
 ise bharne ke liye ham tourism and hospitality skill council (tiechaessi) ke saath kaam kar rahe hai taaki desh bhar main aatithy kshetra ke karmchaariyon ko prashikshan diya ja sake or unka pramann kiya ja sake
 From here we will be able to supply skilled human resources to the industry
 skill india yojana ke hisse ke taur par hamaara lakshya agle teen saal main 150 shaharon ke kareeb teen lakh karmchaariyon ko prashikshit karnaa he
 It takes a lot of courage to leave a decent and well-paid job and enter the uncertain world of entrepreneurship, but the rewards are not personal — when you are able to give options to clients and provide jobs to job seekers
 , It has a transformative effect on the lives of others which contributes to the entire ecosystem

 With the uncontrolled petrol-diesel, the Damodomis are becoming a cause of concern for the government
 aam janata or vipaksh ke baad ab endie ke sahyogiyon ne bhi is par chintaa jaahir kerani shuru kar di he
 JDU leader KC Tyagi, who is running the government with the BJP in Bihar, has demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should now intervene in the issue
 kasee tyaagi kaa kahana he ki america-iran, america-china ke bich pratispardhaa, dollar-rupaya ke bich chal rahi uthapathak ke kaaran petrol-deazal ke daam bad rahe hai

 unhone kaha ki sahyogi dalon ne apni raay rakh di he, ab sarkaar ko jald faisla karnaa hoga
 Let us tell you that the central government is constantly arguing that petrol-diesel prices are increasing due to international reasons
 sarkaar usamen kuch bhi nahin kar sakati he
 Meanwhile, it was told through a graph from the Bharatiya Janata Party that the pace of price rise is less during the NDA tenure and it was more during the UPA
 haalanki, is graph par bhi bijepi soshal media par jamkar trol hui thi
 Significantly, on September 10, a total of 21 political parties led by the Congress had called Bharat Bandh

 Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar, two banks of the river of politics
 ek-duusare ko pachhaadne kii hode rahati he donon main
 Modi announced to make Patel's statue the world's highest statue, how Nitish would have stayed behind
 nitish ne modi hi nahin balki bijepi ke upar bhi waar kiya
 The world's largest Ram temple was announced to be built in Champaran, Bihar
 viraat ramayana mandir 2,800 foot lanbaa, 1,400 foot chaudaa or 410 foot ooncha hoga
 This temple will be built on the lines of Ankorwat Temple in Cambodia but many times larger than that
 haalanki is mandir ke banane main abhi 10 saal lagenge or is par 500 karod rupee kii laagat aane kaa anumaan he
 The opportunity was to show the model of the Virat Ramayana temple, but Nitish did not miss out on politics
 nitish kumaar patna ke mahavir mandir main shankaracharya swaroopanand ke saath maujuud the
 Though Nitish Kumar avoids the saffronis, but the opportunity was to answer Modi, so where was Nitish Kumar going to miss
 lihaaja is maukey par ramamandir mudde par party kii line saaf kar di
 When Nitish gave a clarification on the Ramayana temple, Swami Swaroopanand, who was present, targeted the bjp's definition of Hinduism on the pretext of the statue of Patel
 patel kii murti ke liye modi to kisaanon se loha maang rahe hai, lekin nitish ne yahaan bhi modi ko patkhni di or mandir ke nirmaan ke liye chanda nahin maanga
 That is, the temple is an excuse, the real thing is to bring down Modi in the game of politics
