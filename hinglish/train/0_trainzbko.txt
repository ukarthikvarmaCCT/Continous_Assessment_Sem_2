 Tension remains on both sides of indo-pak
 magar philhal aisa bhi nahin ki donon desh khud ko jang main jhonk den
 But suppose that if both countries jump into the war and then somewhere the indo-pak Peach nuclear war started, what will happen? The picture would be awesome
 ek hafte main hi do karod das lakh log maare jaaenge
 More than half of the people will be scorched by the heat of the bomb
 jo log bachenge wo radiation se maare jaaenge
 Half of the world's ozone layer will be wasted
 aadhi duniya se sardi-garmi kaa mausam hi khatm ho jayega
 Nuclear winter will destroy the world
 vanaspatiyon or ped-paudhon kaa nishaan tak mit jayega
 Half of the world's two billion people will just die of hunger
 aadhi duniya aegi chapet membaat sirfhindustan or pakistanki nahin he
 Half the world is at stake
 ji haa
 If there is a war between India and Pakistan by mistake and in that war, if both countries press the button of only half their atomic bomb, then in India and Pakistan, two crore one million people will be killed in one stroke
 magar iskaa asar naa sirf baaki padosi mulkon balki aadhi duniya ko bhi jhelana padegaa
 Each of the atomic bombs that India and Pakistan possess are equivalent to 15 kilotons of bombs dropped on Hiroshima
 ye bam jaise hi girenge sabase pehle isaki garmi, tapish or radiation logon ko maaregi
 Even after that, it will not be easy for those who survive
 bhopal gas traasadee ke tees saal baad aaj teesri peedi bhi biimaar paidaa ho rahi he
 Then it is a nuclear bomb
 andaja lagaaie iskaa asar kitna lanbaa or khatarnaak hoga
 People will die by doing sesame seeds, the effect of radiation of the seeds will not only torment the people, but they will also be killed by sesame seeds with other methods and results
 vaigyanikon kii maane to itane radiation se vayumandal main ozon parat barbaad ho jaaegi
 The disappearance or ruining of the ozone layer from the atmosphere now means that the gas will be removed from the air which changes the weather
 yani aadhi duniya main sardi-garmi ke mausam kaa silsilaa hi band ho jayega
 In such a situation, it is very possible that after this war, such a terrible cold will occur that only the name-marks of trees and plants can be erased from the world
 aise main insaanon kii haalat kya hogi ye samajha ja saktaa he
 Because of this about 2 billion people will be starved
 ye aankade 2013 main bhautik vaigyanikon ke antarrashtriya sanghathan ne parmaanu yuddh rokane ke liye kiye gaye ek adhyayan ke baad jari kiye the
 If war scientists believe that two thousand times more humans will die, in the event of atomic war between the two countries, 2 crore 10 lakh people will die in the first week itself
 mauton kaa ye aankada duusare vishwa yuddh main maare gaye logon kii taadaad ke mukaable aadhi hogi
 Not only this, this figure of death will be 2 thousand 221 times more than the total number of common people, police, jawans and security forces killed in terrorist attacks in the last nine years in India
 kehane kaa matlab he ki is vakt aatankwaadi insaan or insaaniyat ko jitna nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai, parmaanu yuddh usase 2 hajaar guna zyada insaanon kii jaan legaa

 hazrat mohammad ke talwaar hatf ke naam par pakistan ke paas jo medium range belastic missile he usase wo hindustan ke chaar bade shahar yani dilli, mumbai, bengaluru or chennai ko nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 Major misses of the Indian Army can also be targeted with these missiles

 Thousands of candidates have been caught in a big problem ahead of the Delhi Subordinate Service Selection Board examination on June 25
 samasya ye he ki wo pariksha kaise den? darasal DSSSB kii website se pariksha main shaamil hone ke liye candidats kaa admit card hi downlod nahin ho rahaa he
 Instead of fixing this flaw in the website or providing any help to the students who have come to the office, the DSSSB office has closed its doors
 puure desh se kareeb 90 hajaar candidats ne is pariksha main shaamil hone ke liye aavedan kiya hua he
 Distressed applicants are forced to perform the result
 zyaadaatar ko lagata he ki dsesasabi kii laaparvaahee kaa nateeja unhen bhugatna padegaa or wo pariksha me shaamil nahi ho paaenge
 Amit from Rajasthan said that no one is telling anything, how to get the admit card, the doors of the office have been locked here

 ye un aavedakon kaa dard he, jo pichley ek maheene se dsesasabi ke daftar ke chakkar lagaakar pareshaan hai lekin pariksha main baithne ke liye unke paas admit card hi nahi he
 They do not even know at what time and place the examination is to be held
 dsesasabi ke adhikari hamase bhi baat karne ko taiyaar nahin the or na hi hamaare sawaalon ke jawaab dene ko
 With this, his sensitivity can be gauged that no officer felt the need to meet the applicants standing at the gate in the summer from different states on the campus of DSSSB in Karkardooma
 guard ne get kaa darwaja tak nahin kholaa
 In such a big question, how will these applicants sitting after preparing for the exam after years of work, will be able to give their exam on 25 June

 The grand alliance convened a press conference in Patna in a hurry to announce the candidates
 argedy ne do siton ke liye apane ummidavaaron kaa elaan kar diya
 RJD has fielded Shailesh Kumar alias Boolo Mandal from Bhagalpur and Jayaprakash Yadav from Banka
 haalanki congress ke khate main gai katihaar, purniya or kishanganj seat par ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa roak di gai he
 It is being told that the Congress high command is not happy about seat sharing in the grand alliance
 shanivaar ko purniya main raily karne aae congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko jo jaankaree di gai, wo acchhee nahin thi
 This is the reason that he has summoned many leaders including Congress in-charge of Bihar, Shakti Singh Gohil and state president Madan Mohan Jha
 mahagathbandhan ke press conference main maujuuda congress ke pradesh pravaktaa harkhu jha ne kaha ki unhen dilli se soochna di gai ki congress apane ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa dilli main baithak khatm hone ke baad karegi
 He said that State President Madan Mohan Jha from Delhi called him and asked him to do so
 jabaki ummidavaaron kii list bilkul tay maani ja rahi thi
 Notably, Tariq Anwar, who came to Congress from NCP from Katihar and Uday Singh alias Pappu Singh, who recently went to BJP from BJP, was considered to be getting tickets
 lekin ain vakt par congress ne apane ummidavaaron kaa elaan nahin kiya
 It is believed that the deal between the Congress and the RJD has not been fully done regarding seat sharing
 seat bantwaare ke elaan ke din bhi tejasvi yadav nadaarad rahe jabaki congress ke pradesh adhyaksh madan mohan jha or argedy ke manoj jha ke bitcheet kaa jo video viral hua, wo bahut kuch bataane ke liye kaaphi he
 Significantly, after giving information related to seat sharing to Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who came to Purnia for the election rally, 3 big leaders of Bihar Congress, Shakti Singh Gohil, Madan Mohan Jha and Akhilesh Singh have left for Delhi along with Rahul Gandhi
 khabar aisi he ki rahul gandhi seat bantwaare ko lekar naakhush hai
 In such a situation, Rahul Gandhi has summoned these three leaders to Delhi
 khabar to ye bhi he ki seat bantwaare ko lekar congress jald hi koi bada faisla le sakati he
 RJD also distanced himself from Rahul Gandhi's meeting held in Purnia on Saturday
 mahagathbandhan ke pehle chunavi sho se tejasvi yadav bhi nadaarad the
 It is clear from all these developments that everything is not going well with the Grand Alliance in Bihar
 agar sab kuch thik hota to argedy kii tarah congress bhi apane ummidavaaron kaa elaan karti lekin aisa nahin hona kahin na kahin seat bantwaare main nakhushi kii ore ishaara kar rahaa he

 mumbai kii vishesh adaalat main 26 / 11 hamalon kaa wadamaf gavaah david hedli kii in dinon di gai gavaai kaa cross ikjamination jari he
 The proceedings have started from Wednesday
 guuruuvaar ko bhi yah kaarywahi jari he
 Responding to a defense question today, Headley said that there was a one-time attempt to kill Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray
 haalanki usne ye bhi kaha ki use zyada pataa nahin he
 Headley also stated that he had come to know that the man had also been caught, but later he had also escaped from police custody
 hedli ne ye bhi bataaya ki LET ke sajid mir ne use shivasena bhawan main jaakar dosti banane ko kaha tha
 LET wanted to kill Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray
 hedli ne bataaya ki 26 / 11 aatanki hamale ko tivi par dekh hedli kii patni sajia ne hedli ko badhai dete hue kaha tha ki usne cartoon dekha
 Sajia also congratulated Headley for the attacks
 adaalat main bachaav paksh ke sawaalon ke jawaab main hedli ne uparokt baat maani or safai di ki meri suraksha ke liye usne cartoon shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Headley also agreed that it was he who had asked Sajia to match it in code
 lekin kya he sajia ke pita kaa naam or kya wo ISI se jude the
 Headley refused to respond, citing a personal matter
 jundaal ke vakil abdul wahaab khan ne cross ejamination main hedli kii pehali patni faiza se jude sawaal bhi puche
 For example, did Fiza complain at the American embassy in Pakistan that he was associated with a terrorist organization
 jawaab main hedli ne haa kaha or bataaya ki usne LET se jude hone kii shikaayat kii thi
 Headley also admitted that he had made a video of the Taj Hotel when he came to Mumbai with Fiza
 jundaal ke vakil ke ye poochne par ki kya faiza ne use tokaa nahin
 Headley's answer was that he did not know the motive, so why object? ye poochne par ki kya faiza ne LET ke pramukhon se milakar aapako chhodane kii baat kahi thi
 On this, the judge asked Wahab to put his question correctly
 tab wahaab ne hindi main kaha ki koi bhi patni apane suhaag ko bachaane ke liye is tarah kaa kadam uthaa sakati he
 On this, Headley also said in a funny tone in Hindi itself, to save Suhag is a film dialogue
 mujhe kisase khatra tha jo wo bachaane kii guhaar lagaati
 Actually Fiza felt that i believed the people of LET, so if they say i will agree
 isliye usne unase milakar guhaar lagaai thi
 On asking Jundal the question that you divorced him because of complaining to LET
 hedli ne ye kah kar inkaar kiya ki uskaa talaak pehle hi ho chukaa tha
 Let us know that on Wednesday, Headley surprised everyone by claiming to have given money to the terrorist organization laskar-e-taiba
 mauka tha 26 / 11 ke hi aaropee abu jundaal ke khilaaf chal rahe mukademe main gavaahi kaa
 In the court, when Jundal's lawyer repeatedly asked how much money was received from the terrorist organization laskar-e-taiba
 to vifarte hue hedli ne kaha ki use rupee mili nahin he balki usne khud lashkar ko 60 se 70 lakh rupee daan die the
 The comments jundaal ke vaqeel ne hedli kii pehle kii giraftaaryaan, uski sarkari gavaah banane kii niti or baad main niyamon ko todane kii baat court ke saamne pesh kii
 Overall, the defense tried to bring to light Headley's criminal history and his double character through his questions to prove that Headley's revelations could not be blindly trusted
 vishesh sarkari vakil ujjwal nikam is par safaai dete hue nazar aaye
 According to Nikam, Headley was the culprit when he helped in the 26 / 11 terror attack
 adaalat main abhiyojan paksh or bachaav paksh main khaasi nonk jhonk bhi hui
 The matter became even more heated when Headley refused to answer any questions about his wife
 yun to hedli maafi kaa gavaah he lekin uskaa talkh ravaiya kuch or hi kah rahaa he
 The court also notices this and hides Headley
 hedli ne bhi ye bataaya ki use pataa chalaa tha ki wo shaks pakadaa bhi gaya tha, lekin baad main wo police hiraasat se bhaag bhi gaya tha
 Headley also told that Sajid Mir of LET had asked him to go to Shiv Sena Bhavan and make friendship
 LET shivasena pramukh bal thakare ko maarna chahta tha
 Headley said that after watching the 26 / 11 terror attack on TV, Headley's wife Sajia congratulated Headley and said that he saw the cartoon
 sajia ne hamalon ke liye hedli ko badhai bhi di thi
 In response to defense questions in the court, Headley obeyed the above and clarified that he used the word cartoon for my protection
 hedli ne ye baat bhi maani ki usne hi sajia ko kuta bhashaa main hi mail karne ko kaha tha
 But what is the name of Sajia's father and whether he was associated with ISI
 hedli ne nijee maamla bataakar jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 Jundal's lawyer Abdul Wahab Khan also asked questions related to Headley's first wife Fayza in the cross examination
 masalan kya faiza ne pakistan main america duutavas main shikaayat kii thi ki wo aatanki sanghathan se judaa he
 In response, Headley said yes and said that he had complained about being associated with LET
 hedli ne ye bhi mana ki faiza ke saath jab wo mumbai aayaa tha tab usne taj hotel kaa video banaaya tha
 When Jundal's lawyer asks if Fiza did not interrupt him
 hedli kaa jawaab tha ki use makasad hi pataa nahin tha to aapatti kyon karti ? Asked if Fiza had met the LET chiefs and asked you to leave
 is par jaj ne wahaab se apana sawaal sahi tareeke se rakhane ko kaha
 Then Wahab said in Hindi that any wife can take such a step to save her Suhag
 is par hedli ne bhi hindi main hi mazaakia lahaze main kaha, suhaag ko bachaana to filmi doylog he
 Whom was i in danger that she would request to save
 darasal faiza ko lagata tha ki main LET ke logon ko maanata hum isliye agar wo kahenge to main maan jaaoongaa
 So he requested to meet them

 Headley denied this, saying that he had already been divorced

 Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam appeared to give a clarification on this
 nikam ke mutabik hedli apradhi tha tabhi to 26 / 11 ke aatanki hamale main madad kii
 The prosecution and the defense in the court also had a significant knock
 yah maamla tab or garm ho gaya jab hedli ne apni patni se jude kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab dene se saafe inkaar kar diya tha
 Although Headley is a witness to the apology, but his callous attitude is saying something else
 adaalat ne bhi is baat ko notice kiya or hedli ko tokaa bhi
 Headley said that after watching the 26 / 11 terror attack on TV, Headley's wife Sajia congratulated Headley and said that he saw the cartoon
 sajia ne hamalon ke liye hedli ko badhai bhi di thi
 In response to defense questions in the court, Headley obeyed the above and clarified that he used the word cartoon for my protection
 hedli ne ye baat bhi maani ki usne hi sajia ko kuta bhashaa main hi mail karne ko kaha tha
 But what is the name of Sajia's father and whether he was associated with ISI
 hedli ne nijee maamla bataakar jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya

 Although Headley is a witness to the apology, but his callous attitude is saying something else
 adaalat ne bhi is baat ko notice kiya or hedli ko tokaa bhi
 Headley also agreed that it was he who had asked Sajia to match it in code
 lekin kya he sajia ke pita kaa naam or kya wo ISI se jude the
 Headley refused to respond, citing a personal matter
 jundaal ke vakil abdul wahaab khan ne cross ejamination main hedli kii pehali patni faiza se jude sawaal bhi puche
 For example, did Fiza complain at the American embassy in Pakistan that he was associated with a terrorist organization
 jawaab main hedli ne haa kaha or bataaya ki usne LET se jude hone kii shikaayat kii thi
 Headley also admitted that he had made a video of the Taj Hotel when he came to Mumbai with Fiza
 jundaal ke vakil ke ye poochne par ki kya faiza ne use tokaa nahin
 Headley's answer was that he did not know the motive, so why object? ye poochne par ki kya faiza ne LET ke pramukhon se milakar aapako chhodane kii baat kahi thi
 On this, the judge asked Wahab to put his question correctly
 tab wahaab ne hindi main kaha ki koi bhi patni apane suhaag ko bachaane ke liye is tarah kaa kadam uthaa sakati he
 On this, Headley also said in a funny tone in Hindi itself, to save Suhag is a film dialogue
 mujhe kisase khatra tha jo wo bachaane kii guhaar lagaati
 Actually Fiza felt that i believed the people of LET, so if they say i will agree
 isliye usne unase milakar guhaar lagaai thi
 On asking Jundal the question that you divorced him because of complaining to LET
 hedli ne ye kah kar inkaar kiya ki uskaa talaak pehle hi ho chukaa tha
 Let us know that on Wednesday, Headley surprised everyone by claiming to have given money to the terrorist organization laskar-e-taiba
 mauka tha 26 / 11 ke hi aaropee abu jundaal ke khilaaf chal rahe mukademe main gavaahi kaa
 In the court, when Jundal's lawyer repeatedly asked how much money was received from the terrorist organization laskar-e-taiba
 to vifarte hue hedli ne kaha ki use rupee mili nahin he balki usne khud lashkar ko 60 se 70 lakh rupee daan die the
 The comments jundaal ke vaqeel ne hedli kii pehle kii giraftaaryaan, uski sarkari gavaah banane kii niti or baad main niyamon ko todane kii baat court ke saamne pesh kii
 Overall, the defense tried to bring to light Headley's criminal history and his double character through his questions to prove that Headley's revelations could not be blindly trusted
 vishesh sarkari vakil ujjwal nikam is par safaai dete hue nazar aaye
 According to Nikam, Headley was the culprit when he helped in the 26 / 11 terror attack
 adaalat main abhiyojan paksh or bachaav paksh main khaasi nonk jhonk bhi hui
 The matter became even more heated when Headley refused to answer any questions about his wife
 yun to hedli maafi kaa gavaah he lekin uskaa talkh ravaiya kuch or hi kah rahaa he

 These are the latest weapons of the battle in Bihar that is going on between the Social Justice Alliance led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the NDA alliance of bjp-led Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 modi ne 25 july ko mujffarpur kii apni pehali raily main nitish par hamalaa bolte hue kah diya tha, “nitish kumaar ke siyaasi diene main hi kuch gadabadi he
 "who then thought that this would be a tool of tremendous mobilization in the RJD-JD (U) camp about" Ahat Bihari Gaurav "
 nitish ne daawa kiya ki unki beijjati puure bihar kii beijjati he
 What was it then, Lalu Yadav and Sonia Gandhi stood with him in this
 mujffarpur main modi ke tanj ke baad nitish or prashanth kishor bhagalpur ke doordaraj ke ilaakon main logon se mail-mulaakaat kar rahe the
 Kishore is handling the public relations from the Chief Minister to the election campaign and the media
 unke ek kareebi sutara bataate hai, “ek yadav kisaan nitish ke khilaaf modi ke tanj par behad naaraaz dikhaai de rahaa tha
 He said that "he has not called us cheating
" ” tab hamane khud se poochna shuru kiya ki kya log modi kii baat se itane zyada gusse main hai
 The "there is nothing wrong with my Bihari DNA" campaign started from here
 ”kishor ne disambar 2011 se lekar 2014 ke loksabhaa ke chunaav kii jeet tak gujarat main modi ke saath behad najadik rahakar kaam kiya tha or abhi haal tak ve bijepi se jude ahm masalon par anaupchaarik bahes-mubaahison main bhi madad karte the
 He has assured both Nitish and Lalu that in the disgrace that Modi has done, the seed of a new "brand Bihar" is hidden and with this, the furnaces of both caste and development can be pushed together
 kishor ko laga ki “swabhimaan” kaa tag modi ke “parivartan” card ko sidhi chunauti degaa
 Both the achievements of Nitish and the mobilization of Lalu's castes can make Modi and his coalition partners chew a lot
 itnaa hi nahin, yah nitish-lalu or unase bhi zyada unke kaaryakartaaon ko josh se bhar degi
 Lalu's aggressive and recently powerful Yadav fraternity has a knack for combating the bombing of Modi's "56-inch chest" in "disrespect to the DNA of Bihar"
 beete hafte patna kii raily main argedy ke noujvaan kaaryakarta bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko di gai lalu kii chunauti par josh se bhare the
 Lalu challenged Shah "to break the Yaduvanshis"
 kishor ke yuva saathiyon ne indian polytical acshan kamity (ipiasi) banaai he, jo nitish kaa chunavi mashinari chalaa rahi he
 The youth associated with it say that in a politically conscious state like Bihar, there is no fear of Shah
 isi tarj par ek naaraa gadha gayah “jhaanse main na aaenge, nitish ko jitaayenge
 "these leaflets were put up all over Patna
 media or vigyaapan ke alaava kishor kii team ne soshal media or mobile ke jariye digital sandeshon kii muhim chalaa di
 He laid emphasis on data and analysis of each constituency
 muhimon main “har ghar dastak” bhi shaamil he
 In this, workers go to at least 10 houses to convey the party's message
 ve kareeb ek karod gharon tak ja chuke hai
 Interestingly, Kishore's companions have also worked with Modi ever since
 rishi raaj singh upi main shah ke abhiyaan main shaamil the, to pratik jain par maharashtra kii jimmedaari thi
 Both laughed when asked about how Nitish's campaign is different from Modi's campaign
 jain ne kaha, “yahaan hamen har kaam khud karnaa padataa he
 For the rally in Patna, we swept the stage, installed speakers and LCD screens, even arranged water-chairs
 yah bhi bataaya ki kiske baad kis vaktaa ko bolnaa chahie
 "there was no dearth of resources in Modi's campaign," says Shashank Mehta, another member of the team
 yahaan phoonk-foonkkar kadam rakhana padataa he
 In the last general election, JD (U) and RJD contested against each other as well as contested against BJP
 yani 17 fisadi muslim, 12 fisadi mahadalit or 27 fisadi behad pichhadi jatiyon ke behad ahm vot bant gaye the
 Nitish was so frightened by this that he left the throne of the Chief Minister and placed Jitan Ram Manjhi on it
 yah kadam or vinaashkari sabit hua
 When Kishore and Nitish met for the first time in December 2014 at the residence of Rajya Sabha member Pawan Verma in Delhi, Kishore told them the first thing that they needed to return to the throne of the Chief Minister
 uske baad ghatnaayen teji se ghatin
 Nitish intimidated and removed Manjhi and then became the Chief Minister
 ve pehali baar sonia gandhi se mili or lalu ke saath sulah ko raji hue
 The three parties, who were enemies at times, understood that if they did not want to drown together, they would have to swim together
 nitish maanate hai, “hakeekat yah he ki hamen bijepi ko haraana he, ham kis dushmani kii baat kar rahe hai
 "soon after the BJP national executive meeting in April 2015, Kishore decided to take charge of Nitish's election campaign
 isse bijepi main khalabali much gai thi
 The teenagers knew many things inside
 ve vahi shaks the, jinhone bachapan main modi ke chaay bechney par congress netaa mani shankar ayyar kii bhaddi tippanee ko sir ke bal palatate hue “chaay par charchaa” kaa rashtriya abhiyaan ched diya tha
 The idea of a 3D hologram to show Modi's glowing image and debate in several hundred constituencies was also a brainchild of him
 nitish ke saath vah kya karenge? kishor ne aadhikarik rup se kuch bhi kehane se manaa kar diya, par itnaa kahana kaaphi hoga ki unki ipiasi kii 800 logon kii fouj juty he
 This includes youth equipped with IIT and IIM degrees
 patna ke strand road par iskaa mukhyalay he
 It is close to CM House
 kishor ahmedabad main modi ke ghar main hi rahakar kaam karte the
 Even in Patna, he works from Nitish's house
 unhone nitish kii uplabdhiyon ko nikhaar kar saamne rakhaa he taaki bijepi ke aaropon kii hawa nikaalane ko taiyaar aankade unke haath main hon
 Occasionally, JD (U) 's murmurs of protest can be heard about how a non-political youth became so effective in such a large socialist party
 magar behad sadhi ranneeti ke saath party kaa abhiyaan shuru hota dekh ye budbudaahaten khamosh pad gayi
 There is no doubt that the stakes are very high in the battle of Bihar
 modi-shah kii jeet na sirf bijepi kii takat ko agle kai saal ke liye pakkaa kar degi, balki vipaksh ko nestnabud bhi kar degi
 On the other hand, if the JD (U) -RJD alliance wins, the endless rhetoric about BJP being an invincible party will be curbed
 vaaki, bihar ek baar phir dikhayega ki bharat kidar ja rahaa he
 a fierce fire broke out in a truck late on Mangolpuri fly over in Delhi

 (pitiai ke input ke saath) An incident occurred with a college student in Delhi that all the girls living in PG have been frightened after listening to him
 ghatana ek saptaah puraani he lekin police ne ek fasebuk post dekhne ke baad is par sangyaan liya
 The surprising thing is that the police came to the call of the first victim girl in this case, but nothing happened
 ghatana pichley guuruuvaar kii he
 Lady Shriram lives in a PG in Ekchathatradilly studying final year in college
 us din wo ladki roj tarah college se lauti or kichan main jaakar lunch banane lagi
 Then he realized that someone was in the room
 magar ladki ko laga ki safai karne vaala aayaa hoga
 But as soon as that girl turned backwards, a 20-21 year old man was standing there
 jisane bear kaa can kichan kii sleb par rakhaa
 And then that young man quickly opened his paint button and took out his private part
 ladki yah dekhakar ghabara gai
 She immediately picked up a nearby chair and bounced towards the young man and she ran to the room next to the kitchen
 usne darwaja andar se band kar liya
 The young man reached the room behind the girl and stood there and knocked at the door
 uske baad vah kisi or kamare main chalaa gaya
 Meanwhile, the girl called pg's caretaker who lives with her family on the fourth floor of the same building
 isi dauraan piji honor kii bahu usee flaur par maujuud thi lekin usne peedit ladki ko police bulaane se manaa kar diya or piji honor ko phone kiya jo kahin raste main treffic main fanse the
 During this time he was present in the room of the victim girl's roommate
 usne apni paint utaar di thi
 He was doing strange acts with his private part with the help of a hairband in the room
 chalis minute baad piji honor maukey par pahunche or unhone us ladke ko pakadakar uski dhunaai kii or phir vahaan se use bhaga diya
 Honor pleaded with the victim girl not to complain to the police and asked to change the main gate of PG
 wo ladkaa 40 minute kar peedit ladki kii rummet ke kamare main ghuskar yuvak gandi harkate karata rahaa tha
 When the victim's roommate returned after 11 o'clock in the night, she called the police after knowing the condition of the room and the whole thing
 isi dauraan piji honor ne uske jaanane vaale had consteble shyaam sundar ko maukey par bula liya
 PG Honor had good relations with him
 pehle to un donon ne jaakar ladakiyon ko bhaashan diya
 He said how girls used to hang out with their friendly boys late at night
 kaise ve parkon main baithe rahete hai
 The constable said that it is difficult for the police to take action against all
 isi tarah se rape or tamaam tarah kii phaltu baaten karne ke baad police vaale ne piji honor ke saath vahaan lage sisitivi camere kii footage dekhi
 Which he called funny
 uske baad bhi unhone ladakiyon ko yah kahkar shikaayat karne se manaa kar diya ki 'ladki jaat ho, kya court kachhari jaaogi
 Nothing will happen with the case
 ek din bhi nahin rakhte hai is cheez ke liye castady main
 In fact, PG Honor was more concerned about the image of its PG than the safety of the girls
 police vaala footage dekhakar hans rahaa tha
 He told the girls that the footage did not show anything they had told him
 jabaki sisitivi footage main sab kuch saaf najar aa rahaa tha
 The police did not help
 piji honor ne aaropee ko baccha bataaya
 The behavior of the head constable of Amar Colony police station was very shocking

 Now the police say that the whole matter has come to their notice
 ve is maamle main karrwai karenge
 First they will meet the victim student and record her statement
 uske baad is maamle main sakht kadam uthaae jaaenge
 There is a lot of anger among the students from this incident

 The foundation of any relationship rests on love, trust and respect
 rishte kii jaruraton ko samajhakar iske prati jimmedaari nibhaana har partner kaa kartavya hota he
 But there are some habits which cause a rift in the relationship
 aaie jaanate hai ve paanch baaten jo achche khaase rishte ko khatm kar sakati hai
 
 
 1
 jahaan prem he vahaan nok-jhonk bhi hoti he
 Where there is consent there is disagreement as well
 agar aap donon ke rishte main koi samasya aa rahi he to baithkar baat karen or turant hal nikaalane kii koshish karen
 Keeping things in mind proves fatal
 2
 Whenever you are having a noose with your partner, do not taunt by remembering old things
 jo baaten biit gai hai unpar dhyaan dene ke bajaay aane vaale kal ko behatar karne kaa prayaas karen
 No partner is good or bad
 uski harakatein jarur buree ho sakati hai
 And if there is love between the two, then habits and actions can be changed
 lekin puraani baton ko lekar taana maarane se partner ke man ko chot pahunchati he
 These 12 things you may not know about kidney 3
 partner ke saath aapkaa rishta bahut vyaktigat maamla hota he
 Do not share it with anyone
 kai baar hota he ki ham partner ke saath jhagade ke bare main doston ko bataane lagate hai
 This deteriorates the relationship and reduces trust, so no matter how bad the personal matters are, they should be avoided in public
 kyonki kal agar aap ke rishte partner ke saath sudhar jate hai to jaanane waalon ke saamne aapaki fajihat nahin hogi
 Women always keep this special thing in the bag, trend 4 has become
 tulana kisi ko nahin pasand hoti he
 Many times, we start judging the partner on the basis of our old love, we start comparing him
 ye katai sahi nahin he
 You should understand that every person is different and needs to compromise a little bit in a relationship
 5
 Often the nature of one partner becomes bossy in a relationship
 jo thik nahin he
 Apart from this, refrain and advice should be avoided on everything
 partner kii bhi ek nijee jindagi hoti he jiskaa sammaan karnaa chahie

 com / oq1e3nryjw In a bid to win the political battle for Rajasthan assembly elections, BJP President Amit Shah is taking a tour after one
 is kadi main guuruuvaar ko shah ne bikaner mendlit sammelanke jariye rajya main jaateey ganit saadhane kaa plan banaaya he
 Let us know that about 17 of Rajasthan
 8 fisadi matadaata hai
 3 of these
 9 fisadi hissaa gaanvon main or 3
 9 per cent share lives in cities
 rajya main kul 200 siten hai
 Of these, 142 seats are reserved for General, 33 seats for Scheduled Castes and 25 seats for Scheduled Tribes
 rajasthan main dalit matadaata bijepi kaa paramparaagat voter mana jaataa he, lekin upachunaav main party se uskaa mohabhang hua he
 As a result, the Congress had to face victory and BJP had to face defeat
 rajasthan bijepi apane paramparaagat vot bank dalit, rajput or brahman ke khisakane se to pareshaan hai
 In such a situation, in the last decade, the Dalit vote bank left Congress and remained connected with BJP
 lekin is baar dalit bijepi kaa moh chhod phir se apni puraani party congress kii taraf laut sakate hai
 BJP president Amit Shah has started working on the strategy of using caste equations in such a situation
 is kadi main bijepi guuruuvaar ko bikaner sambhag main dalit sammelan kar rahi he, jise party adhyaksh amit shah sambodhit karenge
 The majority of the Dalit community votes in this Bikaner division
 iske alaava kai siton par nirnaayak bhoomika main he
 Bikaner division has two Lok Sabha constituencies Bikaner and Sriganganagar reserved for the Dalit community
 iske alaava 5 vidhansabha siten bhi dalit samudaay ke arakshit he
 More important than the Dalit seats is that the coming together of the Dalits in the 19 Assembly seats in Bikaner division or skipping plays an important role in deciding the victory
 SC / ST act ko lekar hue andolan main jis tarah se daliton par karrwai hui he, usase ve khaasaa naaraaz hai
 In such a situation, BJP is constantly trying to help Dalits
 kendriya mantri arjuna meghavaal ko ne campan cameti kaa sahasanyojak bana kar bijepi ne daliton ke liye sandesh dene kii koshish kii he
 The attempt is to dispel this resentment through the Amit Shah Dalit Conference
 shah koun sa mantra dalit sammelan main dete he ki dalit phir se bijepi ko tham le or paramparaagat tareeke se vot karenge

 Under pressure to save his place in the team, Clarke decided to start the innings but Tishara Perera (2 for 22) sent him to the pavilion for a score of 16
 perera ne iske baad shen watasan (4) ko out kiya jabaki david hasi (7) or camerun white (8) bhi adhik der nahin tik sake jisase austrailia ne 43 ran par paanch wicket ganvaa diye
 Haddin and Smith then added 66 runs to bring the team to a respectable score
 srilanka ne iske jawaab main captain kumaar sangakaara kii naabad 44 or salaami ballebaaj tillakaratne dilashaan kii 41 ran kii pari kii madad se saat gend shesh rahete aasaan jeet darj kii
 Opener Mahela Jayawardene also played a helpful 24-run knock and added 35 runs for the first wicket with Dilshan giving the team a cautious start

 Will Jayalalitha be able to focus on development by abandoning the politics of revenge? This is such a question, which Jayalalitha herself can answer

 ' chhbbees may ko wing commander suresh kaarnik (sevanivrutt) ne pune main 28 may ko hone vaale us samaaroh main bhaag lene se manaa kar diya, jisamen raksha mantri manohar parrikar mukhya atithi the
 The 80-year-old wing commander, who was awarded the Vir Chakra for bombing Pakistani targets during the 1971 war, was angered by Parrikar's delay in implementing a pension, a rank for military elders
 isi niti se yah sunishchit hoga ki kaarnik jaise bujurg sanyakarmi ko—jo 1983 main sevanivrutt hue the—utani hi pension milegi, jitani aaj sevanivrutt hone vaale unheen ke rank ke logon ko milti he
 Karnik told India Today, "our leaders have a 'NATO' policy towards the armed forces
" " nato maane 'no acshan, tok only
 'many such jumlas are ready for the NDA, which promised a rank, a pension in its election manifesto
 raksha maamalon par sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke sadsy or rajyasabha saansad rajeev chandrashekhar kehete hai, "ek rank, ek pension sashastr balon ke prati sarkaar kii patibaddhta kaa thos mudda ban gaya he

 duusare, 126 rafel fiters kii kharid ko ghataakar 36 vimaan kar diya gaya
 The reason is lack of resources
 upie kaal kaa teesraa vittiya boj vaala prastaav tha—1 april, 2014 se ek rank, ek pension dena
 It was recalculated and it was found that the previous government had budgeted Rs 500 crore for it
 kaa praavdhaan kiya tha, yah usase kahin adhik kaa prastaav he
 The nda's delay in announcing this has raised doubts within the armed forces
 bhartiya purv sainik andolan (iiesam) ke adhyaksh major general satbir singh (sevanivrutt) kehete hai, "jahaan tak hamaara sambandh he, upie or endie main koi antar nahin he
 "to be fair, Parrikar has inherited the problem, which is several decades old
 1973 ke baad se lagaataar har vetan ayog ne pensionron ke bich kii khai ko or chaudaa kiya he
 The result is that a Major General retiring before 1996 gets a lesser pension today than a Lieutenant Colonel retiring after 1996
 ab tak kii sabhi sarkaron ne is tathy kaa hawala dete hue is antar ko paatane se inkaar kar diya ki yah baari vittiya boj he or phir anya sevaaon vaale bhi yahi maang karenge
 Parrikar lashed out at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who attacked the NDA for not approving a rank, a pension
 aadchan paison kii he, yah ishaara karte hue parrikar ne ek samachar agency se kaha, "rahul kehete hai ki unhone 500 karod ru
 Had made a provision of agar baat 500 karod ru
 If it is, i will sign it tomorrow
 "pichley saal, raksha mantralay ne akalan kiya tha ki ek rank, ek pension lagu karne ke liye use 8,300 karod ru
 Will have to be paid every year
 parrikar ne ek rank, ek pension kii vakaalat karte hue sashastr balon ke vishesh haal kaa hawala diya he
 More than 80 percent of the armed forces personnel retire from the age of 35, while other government employees remain in service until the age of 60
 is saal 17 march ko raksha mantri ne file par hastakshar kar die hai or ise vitt mantralay ko bhej diya he
 The finance ministry is believed to have put a red mark on this file
 virodh ke aadhaar nae nahin hai
 If the government gives equal pension to retirement military personnel, then similar demands will arise from paramilitary forces
 sutara sanket dete hai ki ek rank, ek pension main deree isi vajah se kii ja rahi he kyonki uskaa kendriya sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ke liye saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ke saath vilay kiya jayega
 Its report will be submitted to the government by October and the commission will come into effect from January 1, 2016
 ek rank, ek pension dene se upie ke inkaar ke virodh main 2008 se shuru hokar ab tak 22,000 purv sainik raashtrapati bhawan main apane padak jamaa kara chuke hai
 Since 2011, when the Rashtrapati Bhavan stopped collecting medals, more than 10,000 medals have been piled up at the IESM office in Delhi
 2014 main jab upie ne ek rank, ek pension dene kii sankethik sahmati di to yah bahut deree se uthaaya gaya bahut chota kadam tha
 By then the NDA had come to understand that pension was an emotional electoral issue
 pichley varsh april main narendra modi ne, jo tab endie ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar the, rewadi haryana main purv sainikon kii raily main ek rank, ek pension ko apane samarthan kii ghoshnaa kii

 1 farvari ko unhone kaha ki yah 28 farvari ko ho jayega
 Then on 2 March, he said that on 31 March and finally on 14 April, that the announcement would be made on 30 April

 mumbai indiens ke ballebaaz hardik pandya ne kolkata niterides ke khilaaf mumbai indiens ko jeet dilaane vaali pari kheli
 Pandya hit 61 not out off just 31 balls
 is pari main unhone 8 chauke or 2 joardaar chakke lagaae
 The importance of Pandya's innings can be gauged from the fact that when he came out to bat in the 12th over, Mumbai's score was 79 for four and when he returned to the pavilion, Mumbai's score reached 171 runs in 20 overs
 Had finished tippaniyan Pandya batted in such a vigorous manner that Kieron Pollard faded at the other end
 pandya kii is joardaar ballebaazi kii ahm vajahon main unka khud kaa bharosa or joardaar shats khilne kii chahat thi
 But there was a bigger reason
 wo kya thi? is par pandya ne ipel tii20 dotcom ko die intervyuu main bataaya he, 'ballebaazi ke liye utarane se pehle maine team ke coach riki ponting se anurodh kiya tha ki ve meri bagal main paanch minute ke liye baithen' Ponting did the same and this reinforced Pandya's confidence that he played the desired shots at bowlers like Andre Russell and Umesh Yadav
 ponting ne in paanch minute ke dauraan pandya se kaha, 'wicket par samay lenaa or dabaav mukt hokar apane khel kaa lutf uthaanaa
 If you can do this, then you will be able to hit strongly
 ' Ponting's advice worked for Pandya
 vaise bhi darasal mumbai indiens ke coach riki panting hardik pandya kii pehle bhi tarif kar chuke hai
 Even against Chennai Super Kings, Pandya made his team win by scoring 21 runs off 8 balls
 isse pehle bangalore ke khilaaf muqaabale main bhi pandya ne mahaj 6 gend par 16 ran banaae the
 The 21-year-old Pandya is playing his first season in the IPL and after just 6 matches, he has emerged as the hottest rising star of the season
 pandya ne is joardaar andaaj main ballebaazi kii ki duusare chor par kirone pollard fike dikhaai dene lage
 One of the main reasons for this strong batting of Pandya was his own confidence and desire to play vigorous shots
 lekin isse bhi badi ek vajah thi
 What was she? To this, Pandya told in an interview to IPL T20
com, 'before landing for batting, i requested team coach Ricky Ponting to sit next to me for five minutes'
 ponting ne aisa hi kiya or isse pandya kaa bharosa aisa majboot hua ki unhone andre rasel or umesh yadav jaise gendbaazon par manamafik shats khele
 Ponting told Pandya during these five minutes, 'take time on the wicket and relieve the pressure and enjoy your game
 agar tum aisa kar paae to tum joardaar shats laga paaoge
 ' pandya ke liye ponting kii ye salaah kaam kar gai
 Anyway, Mumbai Indians coach Ricky Panting has praised Hardik Pandya earlier
 chennai super kings ke khilaaf bhi pandya ne 8 gend par 21 ran banaakar apni team ko jeet dilaai thi
 Earlier, in the match against Bangalore, Pandya scored 16 runs from just 6 balls
 21 saal ke pandya ne ipel main apana pehla sijan khel rahe hai or mahaj 6 maichon ke baad ve is sijan ke sabase ubharate star banakar ubhare hai
 Ponting did the same and this reinforced Pandya's confidence that he played the desired shots at bowlers like Andre Russell and Umesh Yadav
 ponting ne in paanch minute ke dauraan pandya se kaha, 'wicket par samay lenaa or dabaav mukt hokar apane khel kaa lutf uthaanaa

 The bus was in a school dress instead of a sari
 amuman skool main jab koi nayaa student admician letaa tha to ham log usase jald se jald baaten karnaa shuru kar dete the lekin yahaan aisa kuch nahin tha
 On the contrary, we used to live in the idea of how to bother him that he should leave school
 vah hameshaa padhati rahati thi
 Most of the children in our class were from the so-called upper caste of the society and she was from a Dalit family
 is kaaran se bhi hamalogon main kaaphi duuri rahati thi
 Neither did we sit with him for lunch nor share chocolate
 jaise hi janvari kaa maheenaa shuru hua skool main ganatantr diwas kii taiyaariyaan shuru ho gai
 We participated and participated in music and dance, which we did not accept
 lekin jab taiyaari shuru hui to is dauraan hamane baatcheet shuru kar di

 sab hamaare skool ke diarector ko dosha de rahe the ki kisi shaadishuda dalit ladki ko stage par laana kahaan tak uchit tha?magar us din ke baad wo hamalogon kii sabase fevorett ho gai thi
 We all started eating together but in secret because we were afraid that what would happen if someone told us in our house? While the truth was that caste was not considered in my house, yet in my house it was done that according to our society we and they are not the same
 isi bich uskaa gauna hone vaala tha
 We thought that if she was going to her in-laws then what should she give her as a gift and how would we reach her house because many of our friends had refused to go to her house
 lekin hamalogon ne thaan liya tha ki ham uske ghar jarur jaaenge or sari saheliyaan is baat par raji ho gayi thi ki ham jaaenge lekin uske ghar par kuch nahin khaaenge
 We bought bangles, lipsticks and copies to gift her
 ham tab itane bade nahin hue the ki yah soch saken ki vah apane sasuraal ja rahi he or aage nahin padhegi to in kaapiyon kaa uske liye ab koi matlab nahin he
 As soon as we reached her house, she ran towards us, took her room

 Has Salim Khan, the father of superstar Salman Khan, really written this controversial poem targeting the media? What is the truth of this, in the viral test, 'aaj Tak / India Today' is going to tell you this
 desh main jab bhi koi badi ghatana hoti he to saleem khan ke naam se ye ‘kavita’ dhadlle se soshal media par share kii jane lagati he
 In this 'poem' starting with 'today i am going to riot with pen paper', the media is being fiercely called out of spite
 saath hi is kavita main salmaan khan, aamir khan, aishwarya ke naamon se bhi tukbandi kii gai he
 'aajtak / India Today' decided to take the alleged poem 'milk milk and water water' through viral test
 ’ sach kii is muhim main baat karne ke liye khud saleem khan se behatar shaks or koun ho sakate the
 When Aaj Tak / India Today spoke to Salim Khan on this issue, he not only denied writing this 'poem' himself but also expressed displeasure that someone using his name was spreading such ridiculous poetry
 To say poetry is also an insult to poetry
 aap khud hi suniye reporter or saleem khan kii phone par hui baat
 
 
 Salim Khan- Zee bolierriporter- Sir, i was asking that there is a poem on social media in your name which is being said about you
 
 
 saleem khan- nahin nahin maine usko report bhi kiya he matter ko, dinaae bhi kiya he, pataa nahin koun he wo kyon kar rahaa he
 
 
 I'm no understand
 reporter- to ye galat he naa aapane aisi koi kavita nahin likhi
 Salim Khan- No, i will not even write such a ridiculous poem
 
 
 reporter- matlab aapkaa likhane kaa jo andaaz hamane padhaa he usase lagata nahin ki aapane aisi koi kavita likhi hogi
 Salim Khan- No, not at all
 Lagariporter- Do you know that this is being circulated in your name? Place, Salim Khan- Yes, everyone knows
 
 
 koi bahut bevakoof aadmi he usne bahut bevakoofi or behuda kism kii kavita likhi he
 He seems to have only one poem and if he calls it poetry then the poem is insulted
 saleem khan ne twitor par bhi is kavita ke liye unke naam kaa istemaal karne waalon ko aade haath liya he
 He wrote in a tweet
 
 
 ‘kuch saal pehle soshal media par ek kavita mere naam se chhaapi, “aaj kalam kaa kaagaj se danga karne vaala hum” yahi kavita baar-baar mere naam se saamne le ai jaati hasalim khan ne ek or twit main saaf kiya ki ve kavi nahin hai or agar kabhi kavita bhi likhte to is kooday se behatar hi likhte
 a couple of years back somewhere on social media a poem was published under my name which started "aaj kalam ka kagaz se danga karne wala hun" the same poem is doing the rounds again under my name
 — Salim Khan (@luvsalimkhan)april 23, 2018-saleem khan ne is twit main likhaa “main kavi nahin hum or agar maine kabhi kavita likhane kii koshish bhi kii hoti to maine is kooday se kahin behatar kaam kiya hota, jo mere naam se failaayaa ja rahaa he
 i don't know what someone is getting from doing all this
 ”I am not a poet and even if i tried my hand at poetry i would do a much better job than the trash that has been published under my name
 i have no idea what anyone is getting out of this
 — Salim Khan (@luvsalimkhan)april 23, 2018to dekha aapane ki kaise desh kii ek jaani maani hasti ke naam se pichley kuch saalon se ye farjivada kiya ja rahaa he
 As a story and screenplay writer, anyone who knows about the brilliance of Salim Khan's writing in Bollywood, will understand that after reading this poem, it can not be expected to write Salim Khan
 yuva peedi beshak saleem khan ko salmaan ke pita ke taur par jaanati ho lekin sattar ke dashak main saleem khan kii story riter ke taur par javed akhtar ke saath jodi kii bollywood main tuuti bolti thi
 The name 'salim-javed' had become the identity of making a film a hit
 amitabh bachchan ko engri yang main kii image dekar superstar banane main ‘saleem-javed’ kii jodi kaa bhi bada haath rahaa
 Knowing the names of the films written by this writer duo, their stylus can be considered amazing
 inaki hit filmon main yaadon kii baraat, janzir, diwaar, sholay, trishul, don, shakti, kranti, kaala pathar kaa shumaar hota he
 Salim Khan wrote 'naam' after the pair broke up with Javed Akhtar
 ye film sanjay dutt kii sabase badi hit filmon main se ek maani jaati he
 It is only by reading 'kavita' that is being spread using the name of Salim Khan, what is its purpose and how the religions are being questioned and questioned
 soshal media par phek massej or phek video kii bharmaar he
 They are cleverly combined with the name of a celebrity and spread on social media so that people believe them and forward
 ye kisi khaas makasad se fasebuk, instagram, blog jaise soshal media plateform par failaae jate hai
 They are circulated indiscriminately through whatsapp
 mansuba yahi hota he ki inhen kisi tarah viral kiya jaae
 Common people also come to know and know, they get into the trap
 darasal unke paas inhen bairiphai karne kaa jariya nahin hota
 Aaj Tak / India Today has launched a campaign to expose this fraud from false factories - 'viral Test'
 saleem khan kii ‘kavita’ kaa sach aapke saamne he
 The 'viral Test' of 'aaj Tak / India Today' will likewise bring viral messages, lies or truths to you on social media

 But there was a time when the NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee had to prove majority in the House and Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government proved a failure in this ordeal and his government fell by just one vote
 baat darasal, 1999 main kii he, jab tamilnadu kii tatkaaleen mukhyamantri jayalalita ne apni party ko endie se alag kar liya tha or vaajapeyi sarkaar vishwaas mat sabit karne ke liye majaboor ho gai thi
 In fact, in the 1998 General Election, no party had got an absolute majority, but with the support of AIADMK, the NDA formed the government at the Center
 kareeb 13 maheene baad april, 1999 main divangat netaa jayalalita kii party ediemke ne vaajapeyi sarkaar se apana samarthan waapas le liya tha, or sarkaar alpamat main aa gai
 After this, the President again asked the government to prove its majority
 jiske baad vaajapeyi sarkaar ko vishwaas prastaav rakhana padaa
 Since then, there was a ruckus in the corridors of Parliament
 17 april 1999 ko loksabhaa avishvaas prastaav par jab voting hui tab sarkaar ek hi vot se haar gai or is tarah sarkaar gir gai
 It is said that the then Chief Minister of Odisha at that time, Girdhar Gamang, voted against the government
