 sardaar patel ke pita jhaberbhai ek dharmaparayan vyakti the
 Vallabhbhai's mother Ladabai was a pious woman like her husband
 vallabhbhai paanch bhai or ek bahan thi
 Patel's wife died in 1908
 us samay unke ek putr or ek putree thi
 He then lived a widower
 duniya kii sabase oonchi murti ke bare main jaaniye sab kuchvakaalat ke peshey main tarakkee karne ke liye kritasankalp patel ne adhyayan ke liye agast, 1910 main landan kii yatra kii
 There he studied manfully and passed the final examination with a high reputation
 grahamantri ke rup main vah pehle vyakti the, jinhone bhartiya naagarik sevaaon (isies) kaa bhartiyakaran kar inhen bhartiya prashasnic sevaayen (iees) banaaya
 By reposing faith in those who served the British, they turned from patriotism to patriotism
 yadi sardaar patel kuch varsh jivit rahete to sambhavat: naukarshahi kaa purna kayakalp ho jaataa
 In the 1929 Lahore session of the Indian National Congress, Sardar Patel was the second presidential candidate after Mahatma Gandhi
 gandhiji ne swadhinata ke prastaav ko sweekrut hone se rokane ke prayaas main adhyaksh pad kii daavedaari chhod di or patel par bhi naam waapas lene ke liye dabaav daalaa or jawaharlalanehrudhyaksh bane
 During the Salt Satyagraha in 1930, Patel was jailed for three months
 patel ko dekhnaa he to paise lagenge
 
 
 Here are the ticket rates in 1931, he chaired the Karachi session of the Indian National Congress
 janvari, 1932 main unhen phir giraftaar kar liya gaya
 He was released in July 1934 and organized the Congress Party organization in the 1937 elections
 san 1937-1938 main patel congress ke adhyaksh pad ke pramukh daavedaar the
 Once again, under pressure from Gandhiji, Patel had to withdraw his name and Jawaharlal Nehru was elected

 Sardar Patel was the prime candidate for the post of President of the Indian National Congress in 1945–1946
 lekin mahatma gandhi ne ek baar phir hastkshep karke jawaharlal nehru ko adhyaksh banavaa diya
 Nehru was invited by the British Viceroy as Congress President to form the Interim Government
 is prakaar yadi ghatnakram saamaanya rahata to sardaar patel bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri hote
 Sardar Patel died on 15 December 1950 in Mumbai
 unhen maranoparant varsh 1991 main bharat kaa sarvocch naagarik sammaan bharataratna diya gaya
 In 2014, the Modi government at the Center started celebrating Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary (31 October) as National Unity Day

 Due to the low air pressure area in north and central India, the monsoon will also return from these areas in the next two days
 vibhaag ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki monsoon kii maujuuda gatividhi ko dekhte huye dakshin pashchim monsoon kii 20 oktober tak puri tarah se vaapasi sambhavit he
 He said that the northeast monsoon, which gives rain in the southern atdeep area, knocks from October 15 to 20
 dakshin pashchim monsoon ke vilambit hone ke kaaran uttar purvi monsoon kii gati par koi asar nahin padegaa
 It is noteworthy that due to the influence of El Nino in the initial phase of Southwest, in June, 33 percent less rainfall was recorded than normal

 Then we remember a man in black mudbed clothes on the roadside, twisting his hands behind a tireless wall of tires
 pankchar vaala
 One such puncturewoman is Aslam, who lives in Fatehpur area of rajasthan
 kuch aam, kuch badmaash si jindagi jeeta
 His wife is Hamida, who runs a shoe store
 ek baccha he
 a friend's wife is Saida, who is now his lover
 ek khurraat shaayar padosi habib he, uski bhi kabhi ladnku to kabhi samajhadaar bivi phojia he
 The town's chaupal is a jam paan, whose short form is BBC
 dhandha he, mushkilen hai
 There are happiness and some fights too
 jed plus kaa gaanaa, pal main palat gai bajiaisa hi ek jhagada fatehpur kii majaar ko lekar bhi he
 Hundreds of families claim him and it is decided that everyone will get a chance to become a Khadim one day, alternately

 Let's make the metaphor of India vs India alive
 baharhaal, piem kuch khayraat dete hai, magar aisi jaisi garib ke daravaaje hathi bandhawa den
 Jade Plus brings security to Aslam's life
 is kadam kaa auchity sahi tehraane ke liye kai raajnneetik, saamaajik takatein or apradhi paala chun maidan main aa jate hai
 At last, the fog of lies clears and democracy sees a new dawn
 sach kii
 This was the outline of the film
 ab baat karte hai isaki khoobiyon par
 Most of the fine details of the film's story are true and good
 masalan, shuruaati drishy main hi jab ham asalam ko kaam karte dekhte hai, to uske haathon par lagi karonch is baat kii tasdik karti he ki vaaki adil hossain apane kirdaar main gahare paithe hai
 In the same way, the house or shop of Hamida should be formed around the paan shop
 iske alaava kirdaaron kaa chayan or unki acting bhi umdaa he, ek ko chhodkar
 Actress like Kulbhushan Kharbanda does not embrace the role of South Indian Prime Minister
 unki acting hameshaa kii tarah umdaa he, magar kirdaar dakshin bhaagta he or vah uttar main utaraate najar aate hai
 If you do not pay attention to this, then Adil Hussain is very involved in the lead role
 ek dam pramanik
 Especially, in the middle of the film, he has been seen to become a natural politician, very naturally
 film 'jed plus' kaa trailrahamida ke role main jo ek garvili garibi he, use mona singh bakhubi apni deh bhashaa se darshaati hai
 Mukesh Tiwari is the surprise package of the film
 asalam ke nikamme shaayar padosi ke role main unhone apni acting kii range kaa parichay diya he
 Mukesh has been getting loud rolls
 yah kuch alag tha
 And great too
 keke raina bhi khurraat dikshit kii besaram badmijaaji ko painaapan dete hai
 The dialogues of the film are relaxed
 cinema kii nai jameen kii nai fasal sa ehsaas dete
 While watching z Plus, you will get to introduce a new type of language, idioms and saying
 ek raajnneetik vyangy vaali film main sanvaadon kaa tikhaa hona bhi jaruri he
 Without appearing too much
 usamen bhi film safal hoti he or iske liye rajkumaar singh or chandraprakash dvivedi badhai ke paatr hai
 For example, when Hamida says that bed is not bought by selling sleep
 yaa phir ek jagah asalam kisi vaakye par afasar se puri maasoomiyat ke saath kahata he, kya pradhanmantri bhi galati karte hai
 Now talk of weaknesses
 film kii kahani shuruyaat main ummid jagaati he
 It seems that the story of a town and a character will open many knots in the journey from Janpath to Rajpath
 pipli live kii tarah
 But in the end, it starts appearing in the bag
 film kaa clymex ho yaa phir kai upakthaaon ko adhuraa chhod dena
 Or give songs or episodes a quick spark to create a quick spark
 asalam or habib kabhi dost the
 Then became enemies
 aakhir main phir dost
 But there is no need to explain why Rakib was made
 isi tarah border ke daaku ke role main sanjay mishra ko bas isliye rakh diya gaya taaki kamedi kaa ek or kota puraa ho sake
 His character looked like a stuffed one
 film ke gane bhi yun hi tagade kaa takaza puraa karne ke liye daale gaye lage
 However, the relief is just that they do not stop anywhere, stopping the pace of the film
 zyaadaatar parshv main hi chalate hai
 Director Chandraprakash Dwivedi's specialty of cinema is the consistency of his characters
 yahaan bhi vah yah kaam bakhubi karte hai
 But the music would have been more authentic, the story even more agile, the talk would have been better
 film jed place ko unhen jarur dekhnaa chahie jinhen kuch hatakar filmein pansad hai
 He likes movies showing situations in an honest manner
 jinhen parde par asli kirdaar or unka virodhabhas dekhnaa pasand he
 The film is a good attempt at political satire
 'gandhi ne saamaajik anyaay or naslwad ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya'swatchta abhiyaan ko safal bananaa, gandhi ko sachhee shradhanjali- malik'pani ke strot, jhil, shahar, kasbon or gaanvon main swatchta sunishchit ho'mahatma gandhi kii 150veen jayanti par jammu or kashmir ke rajyapal satyapal malik ne unhen bhaavbheene shradhanjali di
 The governor described Gandhi as a true ambassador of peace and non-violence
 rajyapal malik ne mangalvaar ko ek sandesh main kaha ki british hukumat ke aupniveshik shashan se azaadi ke liye lambey chale sangharsh main mahatma gandhi kaa yogadan bemisaal he
 He campaigned for a lifetime against social injustice and racism
 iske alaava sahi myne main dharmanirpeksh or sauhardpurn samaaj kii sthapana ke liye unhone antaheen praytn kiye
 The Governor described Gandhi as the true envoy of Shantika and also said that he was a man who had a strong belief in non-violence and who left an indelible mark on the public mind, Malik also remembered Gandhi's contribution in promoting Khadi across the country

 Yet many people gather here everyday

 Now God will be pleased and then their 500 and 1000 ruined notes will become gold
 uttar pradesh kii shandaar kamyaabi ke pehle hi ye log media ke kawarej se bedakhal kar diye gaye hai
 It is important that they are also declared defeated, but these people are not taking the name of giving up
 bahuton ko pataa he ki 31 march tak sirf enarai ke note badale jaaenge
 nris or people living abroad are also having problems
 unamem se bhi kaiyon ke alag alag kaarnon se note nahin badale ja rahe hai
 But we and you keep hoping from the government till the end that what is known to him is kind
 kya pataa uskaa dil pasij jaae or baahar khadey sabhi logon ko bheetar bula le or kah de ki aapke note badale ja rahe hai
 Outside the Reserve Bank of India, these people kept coming in January, coming in February and coming in March
 sabane rigerv bank ko aakiri mauka diya ki kya pataa jo dharak ko adaa karne kaa vachan detaa he wo apane vachan par kaayam rahe

 Everyone's wealth is not black money

 Those who had scam money, they are still being held in Karnataka and Mumbai, who have sweat money, they are standing in front of the Reserve Bank and pleading

 At that time, Anand Sharma of Congress said that his party was not receiving donations
 tab vitt mantri ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ne jo kiya he uske liye bada dil chahie
 Perhaps that is why people deposited outside the Reserve Bank have expectations from the government
 unhen pataa he ki sarkaar ne antim faisla le liya he phir bhi antim vakt tak ummid kyon chode koi
 The media has also forgotten these people and after losing UP, the opposition has avoided any issue of demonetisation

 It is also certified that the said woman is very poor

 Therefore, you are requested to change their old notes

 Someone would have thought that the Reserve Bank would have known English, then gave the certificate in English
 sarkaar or uski sansthaaon se logon kii ummid kii seemaa aap nahin samaj sakate
 Even after the government refuses, people are hopeful that they will say yes once
 tippaniyan The demonetisation was announced by the Prime Minister on 8 November
 kaha tha ki 31 march tak puraane note badale ja sakenge
 On 28 December, the government brings an ordinance that the old notes will not be replaced after 31 December instead of 31 March
 us dauraan kai baar ghoshnaaon ko badla gaya
 The ordinance stated that since December 31, all old notes of 500 and one thousand rupees will no longer be the responsibility of the Reserve Bank of India
 ek niyat samay main rigerv bank ke paanch mukhyalayon main kuch sharton ke saath jamaa karne kii chhot di gai
 If Indian or NRI were out between 9 November to 30 December, they can replace old notes
 mumbai, dilli, kolkata, chennai or nagpur ke bhartiya rigerv bank ke daftar main puraane note badale jaan the
 nris are allowed to exchange notes by 30 June
 research yaa sangrah ke liye das se pachis puraane note hi rakhane kii ijazat di gai
 Keeping more than that will attract a fine of ten thousand or a fine of five times that money
 sarkaar ke adhyadesh ke baad kai tarah kii yachikaayen lekar log adaalat pahunch gaye
 The decision has not come yet
 sunwaayee hi ho rahi he
 The hearing took place on March 7 and 21
 supreme court ne bhartiya rigerv bank or bharat sarkaar ko do hafte kaa samay diya ki ve apana jawaab daakhil karen
 The rules for changing notes will be simple according to the government, but when the common man stands in front of the manager of the bank, he starts thinking of them as my father
 uske liye sari soochnaaon ko samajhnaa itnaa aasaan nahin hota he
 Many know that only NRI notes will be exchanged by 31 March
 enarai yaa videshon main rahane vaale logon ko bhi pareshaaniyaan ho rahi hai
 Many of them are not exchanging notes for different reasons
 magar ham or aap sarkaar se ant ant tak ummid lagaae rahete hai ki kya pataa use raham aa jaae
 Does anyone know that his heart gets sweaty and invites all the people standing outside and tell him that your notes are being changed
 bhartiya rigerv bank ke baahar ye log janvari main aate rahe, farvari main aate rahe or march main aate rahe
 Everyone gave the last chance to the Reserve Bank to know whether the address that the holder pledged to pay should be upheld by his promise
 unki kamai barbaad hone se batch jaae
 What a mistake Master Rajasthan is
 har kisi kaa dhan kaala dhan nahin he
 The color of hard-earned money has also gone bad
 jinke paas ghotaale ke paise the, wo aaj bhi karnataka or mumbai main dhare ja rahe hai, jinke paas paseene kii kamai he wo rigerv bank ke aage khadey hokar gidgidaa rahe hai
 In the hope that the government has a big heart
 wo raham karegi
 On March 23, when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha raised the exemption limit for donations to political parties, it made arrangements that now if a corporate donates, it will not tell in its books who has donated
 us vakt congress ke anand sharma ne kaha ki unki party ko chanda nahin mil rahaa he
 Then the Finance Minister had said that the government needs a big heart for what it has done
 shaayad isliye rigerv bank ke baahar jamaa logon ko sarkaar se ummid he
 They know that the government has taken the final decision, yet why should anyone leave hope till the last moment
 media ne bhi in logon ko bhula diya or upi haarane ke baad vipaksh ne notebandi ke kisi bhi masale se tauba hi kar liya he
 The stories of these people are also buried with old notes amidst the celebration and desperation of any great success
 hamane sochaa dafan hone se pehle kafan uthaakar dekh lete hai, jo log apane puraane note ko haath main lekar ro rahe the, wo koun hai

 During that time the announcements were changed several times
 adhyadesh main kaha gaya ki 31 disambar ke baad se 500 or ek hazaar ke saare puraane note bhartiya rigerv bank kii javabdehi nahin rahenge
 Within a certain time, the five headquarters of the Reserve Bank were allowed to deposit with certain conditions

 After the government's ordinance, people reached the court with a variety of petitions
 abhi tak faisla nahin aayaa he
 Hearing is going on

 Mumbai's Kurla police have caught a thug gang operating on the streets who used to get thousands of rupees in the name of making a spark in the car and intimidating the car drivers by saying smoke was coming out
 is giroh ke khilaaf mumbai ke govendi or duusare police thanon main bhi maamle darj hai

 We are mechanic and will get it made cheaply
 phir wo paas ke garrej main car le jaakar achche part ko kharaab bataakar use badal dete or phir hajaaron rupee vasuulate
 He did the same in Kurla's case, but the car driver got suspicious and informed the police on the pretext of asking for money
 mumbai main spark gang hi nahin kai thak-thak gang bhi sakriy hai
 The mobile phone and pocket of actor Sumit Arora, playing the character of Gomukh, a similar gang zoo serial, were taken away in such a cool manner that they are still surprised how this happened
 sumit arora ke mutabik us raat wo shooting khatm kar apane ghar ja rahe the
 Trains were crawling very slowly near Dahisar Czech Naka
 tabhi car kii baayin taraf ke shishe ko ek shaks ne thak-thakaana shuru kiya
 The comments sumit ke mutabik jaise hi unhone sheesha neeche kiya wo shaks chillane laga ki car mere par kyon chadha di
 Right now he was able to answer him, then another person started beating the mirror on the other side
 sumit ne doosraa sheesha bhi neeche kar usase baat karnaa chaha to wo chalaa gaya
 Sumit could not understand anything, when he turned back and looked at him, he had also gone
 tabhi sumit kaa dhyaan gaya ki bagal main rakhaa unka mobile phone or batua gaayab ho chukaa he
 Sumit is still wondering how this happened? In Mumbai, sometimes spark gangs and sometimes gangs keep hunting car drivers
 police kahati he ki log aise thagon ke jhaanse main na aaen
 But people say that the police do not take their complaints seriously
 isliye aksar log thage jane ke baad bhi shikaayatein karne se bachate hai jiskaa phayda thag giroh uthaate hai
 Not only the Spark Gang in Mumbai, many snooty gangs are also active
 aisi hi ek thak-thak gang chidyaghar serial gomukh kaa kirdaar nibhaane vaale abhinayta sumit arora kaa mobile phone or pokit itane shaatiranaa tareeke se le udi ki wo ab bhi hairaan hai ki aisa kaise ho gaya
 According to Sumit Arora that night he was going to his house after finishing shooting
 dahisar check naakaa ke paas gaadiyaan bahut hi dhimi gati se reng rahi thim
 Then a person started knocking the mirror on the left side of the car
 tippaniyan According to Sumit, as soon as he turned the glass down, the man shouted why the car hit me
 abhi wo use jawaab de pate tabhi ek duusare shaks ne duusari taraf ke shishe ko peetna shuru kar diya
 Sumit wanted to talk down with the other glass too, so he left
 sumit kuch samaj hi nahin paye, palat kar pehle kii taraf dekha to wo bhi ja chukaa tha
 Just then Sumit noticed that his mobile phone and wallet kept on the side have disappeared
 sumit ab bhi hairaan hai ki aisa kaise ho gaya? mumbai main kabhi spark gang to kabhi thak-thak gang car chaalkon ko shikaar banaate rahete hai
 Police say that people should not get caught by such thugs
 lekin logon kaa kahana he ki police unki shikayaton ko gambhirtha se nahin leti
 Therefore, people often avoid complaining even after being cheated, which the thugs take advantage of

 He further told that during this time the daughter supported him a lot
 gauratlab he ki badhai ho film main gajraj or nina ne pati-patni kaa role kiya tha
 Ayushmann Khurrana played the son of both
 film main sanya malhotra ayushmaan ke lav interest ke rup main najar ai thi
 Ahir said that during the investigation, more than 1,000 witnesses have been questioned in different areas of the country
 jaanch main deree ke aarope se inkaar karte hue ahir ne kaha ki in maamalon se jude record bahut puraane or kharaab sthiti main hone ke alaava urdu bhashaa main hone ke kaaran inkaa anuwaad bhi karaayaa ja rahaa he
 He said that investigation is pending due to difficulty in identifying the complainants and witnesses
 unhone kaha ki grih mantralay esaiti ke kaary kii pragati kii niyamit nigaraanee kii ja rahi he
 The comments (input bhashaa se) (from input language) (input bhashaa se) Due to work and studies, people often move out of the house to other cities
 jahaan par apana har kaam khud karnaa padataa he or isi ke saath rahane ke liye piji, hostal yaa phir room main shering bhi kerani padataa he
 Staying away from home, the roommate becomes your only support who stays in the same house with you and becomes the closest in the city of Anjan
 aise main yah jaananaa bhi bahut jaruri he ki aapkaa rummet kaisaa he yaa kisi he kyonki shering ke saath bahut sari jimmedaariyaan bhi aati hai
 If your roommate is good and understanding, then it becomes easy for you to stay out of the house
 agar aap bhi room share karte hai to jaaniye kya kuch aisa he aapkaa rummet
 
 
 1
 agar aapkaa rummet aapako bevajaah disturb nahin karata or aapaki privesi kaa puraa dhyaan rakhata he to aap khud ko lucky feel kara sakate hai
 Because when you share a house with someone, a lot of compromises have to be made
 agar aapke rummet kaa swabhaav bahut acha he to aap bhi uske saath vaisaa hi bartaav karen taaki aapkaa rishta majboot ban sake
 2
 offis time alag hone ke kaaran yaa phir college alag hone ke kaaran aapkaa rummet aapako time nahin de paata yaa paati he or is vajah se wo dukhi ho jate hai to vah sach main aapke liye best rummet he
 If he enjoys your favorite and dislikes even if he is in the same room, then you should also take full care of him
 3
 When your roommate goes somewhere or when he goes to his house in holidays, you start to miss him
 aisa tabhi hota he jab aap donon kii boding acchhee hoti he
 4
 aap donon ke ek duusare kii woderob behichak share karte hai wo bhi bina kisi igo ko bich main laae to yah sin he ki aap donon ke bich ek parfect tuning he
 5
 jab kabhi aap donon ke paas karne ko kuch nahin hota to aapkaa rummet aapke us boring din ko fan or masti se bhar detaa he
 Sharing a room with such a person is a plus point for you because you live with a fun loving person
 6
 If your roommate ends the matter with peace instead of arguing, it can also be a gesture of turning the relationship into a best friend
 isliye aapako bhi uske saath miljul kar rahanaa chahie
 Pakistan on Monday shared the draft of the Kartarpur corridor agreement with India
 pakistan ne bhartiya dal ko islamabad aakar masaude ko antim rup dene kaa nyotaa bhi diya he

 He further said that i want to tell you that we are not caught in your googly
 hamaare do mantri kartarpur sahib (kartarpur corridor) sirf isliye gaye taaki vah is pavitra gurudware main prarthana kar saken
 Let me tell you that Pakistan Foreign Minister Mahmood Qureshi had said a few days ago on the invitation to the Government of India to visit the Kartarpur Corridor, that Prime Minister Imran Khan has given a 'googly' to ensure the Government of India's presence in the foundation stone laying program of the historic Kartarpur Corridor
 Thrown, due to which the Narendra Modi government of India sent two ministers to attend the program

 Pakistan had earlier invited Sushma Swaraj for Wednesday's event, but Swaraj cited her inability to visit Kartarpur Sahib citing prior commitments

 Worshiping Satya as Narayana is the worship of Satyanarayana
 iskaa doosraa arth yah he ki sansar main ekmaatr narayan hi satya hai, baaki sab maaya he
 The whole world is absorbed in truth
 satya ke sahare hi shesh bhagwaan prithvi ko dhaaran karte hai
 Lord Vishnu himself has described the Sri Sathyanarayana fast on the request of Devarshi Narada
 srisatyanarayan vrath kii katha:ek baar yogi naarad ji ne bhraman karte hue mrityulok ke praaniyon ko apane-apane karmon ke anusaar tarah-tarah ke dukhon se pareshaan hote dekha
 Due to this, his saintly heart was moved and while playing the harp, he reached Kshirsagar while performing Hari Kirtan in the shelter of his supreme worshiper Lord Shrihari and said, “O Nath! If you are happy with me, then please tell me a small way to overcome the agony of mortals
 ’ tab bhagwaan ne kaha, ‘he vatsa! tumne vishwakalyaan kii bhaavana se bahut sundar prashn kiya he
 So, thank you
 aaj main tumhen aisa vrath bataata hum jo swarg main bhi durlabh he or mahaan punyadaayak he tathaa moh ke bandhan ko kaat dene vaala he or vah he srisatyanarayan vrath
 By doing this with the help of law, man attains worldly pleasures and attains salvation in the hereafter
 ’iske baad kashipur nagar ke ek nirdhan brahman ko bhikshavriti karte dekh bhagwaan vishnu swayan hi ek buudhe brahman ke rup main us nirdhan brahmïna ke paas jaakar kehete hai, ‘he wipro! shri satyanarayan bhagwaan manovanchit fal dene vaale hai
 You worship them fast, by doing that, the person is freed from all kinds of sorrows
 is vrath main upwas kaa bhi apana mahatv he kintu upwas se maatr bhojan na lenaa hi nahin samajhnaa chahie
 At the time of fasting, there should be a belief in the heart that today Lord Sri Satyanarayan is seated with us
 at: andar va baahar shuchita banaaye rakhni chahie or shraddha-vishwaspurvak bhagwaan kaa pujan kar unki mangalamayi katha kaa shravan karnaa chahie
 'in the evening, this fast-worshiping is considered more paved
 shri satyanarayan kii katha bataati he ki vrath-pujan karne main maanavmaatr kaa samaan adhikaar he
 Whether it is poor, rich, king or businessman, Brahmin or any other class, woman or man
 yahi spasht karne ke liye is katha main nirdhan brahman, garib lakadahaara, raja ulkamukh, dhanwaan vyavsaayee, sadhu vaisya, uski patni leelavati, putree kalavati, raja tungadhvaj evam gopaganon kii katha kaa samavesh kiya gaya he
 By assuming the story, it is concluded that the actions of all those who believed in the truth were proved
 jaise lakadahaara, garib brahman, ulkamukh, gopaganon ne suna ki yah vrath sukh, saubhaahgya, santati, sampatti sab kuch dene vaala he to sunate hi shraddha, bhakthi tathaa prem ke saath satyavrath kaa aacharan karne main lag gayi or falswaroop ihlokik sukh bhogakar paralok main moksh ke adhikari hue
 Sadhu Vaishya also heard the same incident from King Ulkamukh with law, but his faith was incomplete
 shraddha main kami thi
 He used to say that i will worship Satyavrat on the attainment of children
 samay bitne par uske ghar ek sundar kanya ne janm liya
 When his devoted wife reminded him of the fast, he said that he will do it at the time of marriage of the girl
 samay aane par kanya kaa vivaah bhi ho gaya kintu us vaisya ne vrath nahin kiya
 He went on business with his son-in-law
 use chori ke aarope main raja chandraketu dwaara damaad sahit karagaar main daal diya gaya
 Back home was also stolen
 patni leelavati va putree kalavati bhikshavriti ke liye vivash ho gayin
 One day Kalavati saw the worship of Sri Satyanarayana in the house of a Vipra and came home and told her mother
 tab maa ne agle din shraddha se vrath-pujan kar bhagwaan se pati or damaad ke sheeghra waapas aane kaa vardaan maanga
 Srihari was pleased and in a dream ordered the king to release the two prisoners
 raja ne unka dhan-dhaany tathaa prachur dravya dekar unhen vidaa kiya
 Coming home, he organized the full moon and solstice throughout the life of Satyavrat, consequently, he attained salvation by enjoying worldly pleasures
 isi prakaar raja tungadhvaj ne van main gopaganon ko shri satyanarayan bhagwaan kaa pujan karte dekha, kintu prabhutaa ke mad main chur raja na to poojasthal par gaya, na dur se hi pranaam kiya or na hi gopaganon dwaara diya prasad grahan kiya
 The result was that the king's sons, money and grain, and horse and horse were all destroyed
 raja ko aksmaat yah abhas hua ki vipatti kaa kaaran satyadev bhagwaan kaa niraadar he
 He was very sorry
 vah turant van main gaya
 Calling the gopganas took a lot of time and worshiped Satyanarayana God
 phir usne unase hi prasad grahan kiya tathaa ghar aa gaya
 He saw that the disaster was averted and all his property and people were safe
 raja prasannataa se bhar gaya or satyavrath ke aacharan main nirat ho gaya tathaa apana sarvasv bhagwaan ko arpit kar diya
 We learn from Sri Satyanarayana fast that Satyarupa Brahma is present in us in the form of a person
 ham sab satya ke hi swaroop hai, par maaya ke vash main aakar nasht hone vaali vastuon ko sangrah karne kii sochakar sansar main magn ho rahe hai
 Removing this ignorance, accepting the truth and devotion to God is the religion of man
 yahi satyanarayan vrath or katha kaa saar he

 co / ttho4jrp6o Bharatiya Janata Party national president Rajnath Singh has said that Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi has not made any statement that he has saved 15,000 Gujaratis from natural disaster affected Uttarakhand
 singh ne party kii pradesh ikai kii taraf se uttarakhand ke aapadaa prabhavit legon kii madad ke liye bheji gai raahat saamagree or raahat raashi kii pehali kist ko ravaanaa karne ke liye yojit kaarykram ke maukey par samvaadadaataaon ke sawaalon ke jawaab main kaha, gujarat ke mukhyamantri modi uttarakhand main peedit logon se samvednaa jataane vahaan chal rahe raahatkaarya kii jaankaree ke liye gaye the
 i spoke to him myself
 modi ne kaha ki unhone aisa koi bayaan nahin diya he or ve swayan is baat se hairaan he ki yah khabar kahaan se chal padi
 On this occasion, the BJP President refused to talk about Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's visit to Uttarakhand, etc
 and said, "this is not an occasion for political accusation
" uttarakhand main bahut badi prakritik aapadaa ai he or sabko milakar usase nipatna he
 On this occasion, Singh has arranged financial assistance of Rs five lakh from the party to the families of the military officers and soldiers killed in the helicopter accident during the relief and rescue work in Uttarakhand
 rajnath ne bataaya ki uttarakhand traasadee ke maddenjar bhaajapa ne samprag sarkaar ke kushasan ke virodh main aaj se shuru hokar 30 june tak chalane vaale deshvyapee jail baro andolan ko sthagit kar diya he
 He himself appealed to all party workers to collect relief material for the disaster victims and asked all the mlas, mps and office bearers to deposit their one month salary in Uttarakhand Relief Fund
 tippaniyan He said, i myself have instructed all party workers and leaders to refrain from making any offensive comments on the statement of any political party
 singh ne kaha, yah traasadee kii ghadi he
 
 bahut se sanghathan or raajnneetik dal aapadaa peediton ko yathasambhav adhiktam sahaayta uplabdh karaane main lage he
 My appeal to all the workers is that they should also try to help in this direction
 unhone party kii pradesh ikai kii taraf se ekatrit raahat saamagree kii pehali khep ke rup main das trek chaaval, khadyann, kapade evam anya saamagree ravaanaa kii or nakad sahaayta kii pehali kisht ke rup main 56 lakh rupee bhejte hue bataaya ki uttarakhand sarkaar ne raahat saamagree sidhe use na bheje jane kii apil kii he, isliye yah saamagree bhaajapa or rashtriya swayan sevak sangh ke madhyam se vitarit kii jaaegi
 Singh said that the party has also created a relief fund at the central level and the details of the amount and material coming into it will be made public
 isse purv congress ne modi ke uttarakhand daure ko lekar sawaal uthaae the ki vah 'rambo' banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In response to questions from reporters on the occasion of the program organized to release the first installment of relief material and relief amount sent by the state unit of the party to help the disaster affected people of Uttarakhand, Gujarat Chief Minister Modi He went to Uttarakhand to express his condolences to the suffering people for information about the ongoing relief work
 meri unase swayan baat hui he
 Modi said that he has not made any such statement and he himself is surprised from where this news originated
 bhaajapa adhyaksh ne is maukey par congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke uttarakhand daure aadi ke bare main koi bhi baat karne se inkaar kar diya or kaha, yah mauka raajnneetik aarope-pratyarope kaa nahin he
 There is a huge natural disaster in Uttarakhand and everyone has to deal with it
 singh ne is maukey par uttarakhand main raahat or bachaavkaarya ke dauraan helicopter durghatana main maare gaye sainya adhikariyon evam javaanon ke parijanon ko party kii taraf se paanch-paanch lakh rupee kii aarthik sahaayta kii gheshna kii he
 Rajnath said that in view of the Uttarakhand tragedy, the BJP has postponed the nationwide Jail Bharo movement starting from today to June 30 to protest against the misrule of the UPA government
 unhone swayan party ke sabhi kaaryakartaaon se aapadaa peediton ke liye raahatsaamagree jutaney tathaa sabhi vidhayakon, saansadon evam padaadhikariyon se apane ek maah kaa vetan uttarakhand raahat kosh main jamaa karne kii apil kii
 The comments unhone kaha, maine swayan sabhi party kaaryakartaaon evam netaaon ko nirdesh die he ki kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ke bayaan par is maukey par koi aakraamak tippanee se bachein
 Singh said, it is a time of tragedy
 
 Many organizations and political parties are engaged in providing as much assistance as possible to the disaster victims
 sabhi kaaryakartaaon se meri apil he ki ve bhi is disha main adhiktam sahaayta karne kii koshish karen

 Earlier, the Congress had raised questions about Modi's visit to Uttarakhand that he was trying to become a 'rambo'
 modi ne kaha ki unhone aisa koi bayaan nahin diya he or ve swayan is baat se hairaan he ki yah khabar kahaan se chal padi
 On this occasion, the BJP President refused to talk about Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's visit to Uttarakhand, etc
 and said, "this is not an occasion for political accusation
" uttarakhand main bahut badi prakritik aapadaa ai he or sabko milakar usase nipatna he

 isse purv congress ne modi ke uttarakhand daure ko lekar sawaal uthaae the ki vah 'rambo' banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Rajnath said that in view of the Uttarakhand tragedy, the BJP has postponed the nationwide Jail Bharo movement starting from today to June 30 to protest against the misrule of the UPA government

 Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc has expressed disappointment at the Optus Stadium pitch getting an ICC 'average' rating after Australia's 146-run win over India in the second Test
 perth main kuch ballebaajon ko khelte samay gend lagi thi, visheshkar duusari pari main
 Stark said it was good offensive Test cricket and such a rating would make it a complete batsman's game
 stark ne baxing de test se purv kaha, ‘cricket prashansak ke rup main yah thodaa niraashajanak he ki perth pich ko ausat reating di gai
 i think it was a great battle between the ball and the bat that you want to see in Test cricket
 ’unhone kaha, ‘udhaaharan ke liye pichley saal emsiji main khelnaa kaaphi neeras tha or pich ne kuch nahin kiya
 You want a match between the ball and the bat, which will keep Test cricket alive and draw people to the field like Perth
 vahaan shandaar sangharsh tha or mujhe lagata he ki vah behtareen pich thi
 The cracks played their part, Stark said, but when the pitch breaks on the fourth and fifth days, it happens
 agar aap hameshaa sapaat pich taiyaar karoge, to cricket ballebaajon kaa khel ban jayega
 You want an exciting match between the ball and the bat
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jab gend move kar rahi hoti he or ballebaajon ko khelnaa hota he, yahi khel he
 Marcus Harris continued to play despite getting the ball and the batsmen of both the teams were hit on the shoulders, but they continued to play
 yah acha aakraamak cricket tha or yah logon ko khel tak khinchakar laata he
 Stark was criticized for being lethargic during the Adelaide Test, but responded critically to critics by taking 10 wickets in both the two Tests
 ye bhi padhein- IND vs AUS: perth pich kii ausat reating par maaikel won bhi bhadkeis tej gendbaaj ne kaha ki australian akraman bharat ke khilaaf jaldi wicket chatakaane kaa sanyukt prayaas kar rahaa he or bhartiya salaami ballebaajon ke kharaab form main hone se unhen nishchit taur par madad mili he
 He said, 'this is our plan, we want to get wickets early and bowl the middle order with a new ball
 ab bhi hamaari yahi yojana he
 We will see if they change the top order
 hamaari ab bhi yahi yojana he- unhen jitna adhik sambhav ho utana dabaav main daalane kaa prayaas karo or jitna jaldi ho sake madhyakram ko gendbaaji karo
 The left-arm pacer, however, does not want to play lightly if India openers Murali Vijay and Lokesh Rahul get a second chance
 stark ke tej gendbaaji saajhedaar pat kamins ne perth main viraat kohli ko gendbaaji karne par kaha ki jab aap duniya ke sarvshereshth ballebaaj ko gendbaaji karte hai, to galati kii adhik gunjaaish nahin hoti

 daramil, sunwaayee ke dauraan mumbai loyrs association ke vakil dushyant dave ne court kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha tha ki jo bhi daleel ham dete hai, aap fouran uski kaat bataa dete hai
 You are saying that the reason for Judge Loya's death may be different from this
 jabaki maharashtra sarkaar ke vakil se aapane aisa koi sawaal nahin kiya
 During the hearing, there was again a heated argument between Dushyant Dave and Maharashtra Government lawyer Mukul Rohatgi
 ye tab hua jab maharashtra police kii gopneey jaanch par dave ne sawaal uthaaye the
 Then Mukul Rohatgi said that the statements of the judges, police investigation and medical report are all wrong, only Dushyant Dave is right

 Pakistan is plotting a big conspiracy against its country Hindustan on the desert border

 Former BSF DIG Bhagwatilal Chauhan, who was also present on the border with the Chinese troops, said that it is a matter of concern that a large number of Chinese are also present on this border
 bhartiya khufia angenciyon ko in ilaakon main satellite phones signal bhi mili hai
 This showed that these signals belong to Chinese companies

 The BSF expressed strong opposition and the BSF has objected to the construction near the border

 amit shah ne bijepi adhyaksh kii kursi sambhaal lee he
 In such a situation, people's curiosity about them is increasing
 jaaniye koun hai amit shah
 
 
 Actually, Amit Shah is the biggest guru of Modi management
 gujarat kii raajnneeti main aisa kam hi hua he, jab kisi vyapaaree ke bete ne siyaasi daanvpech main maahir hone kii shoharat hasil kii ho
 Born to businessman Anilchandra Shah, Amit Shah has now become the general of the BJP
 bijepi mahasachiv amit shah kii jindagi teen shabdon ke ird-gird gumti he- modi, encounter or upi
 But those close to him point out that Shah has no answer in recognizing the challenges and opportunities
 shakha, stock or raajnneeti
 
 
 Amit Shah, a student of science graduate college, used to go to Sangh branches since childhood and was a stockbroker before joining politics
 ek stock brokar or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sadsy amit shah ab bijepi main kisi kaa bhi 'stock' upar le ja sakate hai or kisi ko bhi siyaasi daud se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa sakate hai
 Shah's close aides say that he started a plastic business inspired by Dhirubhai Ambani and other wealthy businessmen, but soon realized that it was difficult to build a large industry without government support
 ek varisht sangh prachaarak ne 26 varsh ke yuva amit shah ko us samay tak sangh or bijepi main apni paith bana chuke 41 varshiya narendra modi se milwaaya
 Modi was forming his team in those days and he was impressed by Amit Shah's confidence
 amit shah ne modi se laalkrishna adwani kaa chunaav-prachaar sanbhaalane kii ichha jataai
 Shah said that his father, Manasa, who comes in the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency, has been an eminent businessman and is well versed in the political equations of Gandhinagar
 adwani ke us chunaav ke baad shah ne party main acchhee pahchaan bana lee
 Many who have closely observed the politics of BJP and Gujarat, describe Modi and Shah's relationship as that of Advani and Modi in the 1980s and 1990s
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki modi ko shah main apane us yuva josh kii jhalak dikhi or unhone apana abhinn sahyogi bana liya
 In 2001, when Modi replaced Keshubhai Patel as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he had made Amit Shah a strong leader even before that
 shah 1995 main gujarat state financiel corporation ke chairman banaae gaye
 While living on this post, he could not show much effect, but while staying here, he got his eye on the co-operative bank sector of Gujarat
 bas kuch dinon main wo ahmedabad district ko-oparative bank ke mukhiya ban gaye
 Shah is Modi's eye - the days after seeing the growing opposition of Modi in Gujarat, the party called him to Delhi
 lekin gujarat main rahete hue shah modi ke aankh-kaan bane rahe or gujarat kii raajnneeti kii pal-pal kii khabar unhen pahunchaate rahe
 During this time, Shah began to consolidate his hold over the Gujarat co-operative bank and the Mandalis, which had been under Congress's occupation for years
 saal 2002 main narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi kii dobaaraa sarkaar bani, to kshamta, sooyeeboojh or vafadari dekhte hue sarkaar main sabase kam umr ke shah ko grih rajyamantri banaaya gaya
 Shah was given the maximum ten ministries and was made a member of dozens of cabinet committees
 un dinon yah charchaa thi ki shah par ye meharbaaniyaan keshubhai ko hataane main madad karne ke inam ke rup main kii gai thim
 In 2002, Amit Shah was given a ticket from the Sarkhej assembly by the party
 chunaav main vah record ek lakh 60 hajaar maton se jeet kar aae
 This victory was bigger than Narendra Modi's election victory
 2007 main jaakar yah aankada 2 lakh 35 hajaar par pahunch gaya
 Modi became an admirer of Amit Shah's electoral tactics
 modi mantrimandal main amit shah jald hi sabase bade netaa ke taur par ubhare
 Then what was left
 
 
 'jo hukum mere aakaa' ke tarj par shah modi ke har mansoobey ko anjaam tak pahunchaate rahe
 Whether it is Gujarat's co-operative congregation or a public-private sector employees union, Shah waved the BJP flag everywhere
 shah modi ke kavach ban chuke the or or phir chaahe police afasar hon yaa vipaksh ke netaa yaa gujarat bijepi main modi virdohi, shah ne sabhi ko modi ke aadesh maanane ko majaboor kar diya
 Modi believed that unless the police and government officials were with him, he would not last long in the state
 raajnneetik galiyaaron main kaha jaataa he ki shah jaisi micro management or chunaav ke vakt booth management kii kshamta kam hi logon main he
 Modi once raised a concern with Shah about the Congress' hold in the Gujarat Cricket Association
 phir kya tha, shah ne 2009 main modi ko janmdin ke tohfe ke rup main association kaa adhyaksh pad diya or khud upaadhyaksh ban gaye
 However, with Shah and Modi joining the association, the cricket atmosphere deteriorated and not a single new player of the state could make his place in Team India
 haalanki, shah ke gujarat se baahar rahane ke dauraan unke putr jai party ke bheetar or baahar apni jagah bana rahe hai
 Jai has recently become the General Secretary of the Gujarat Cricket Association and is keenly interested in the team's election, which has angered senior players
 amit shah or narendra modi ke jivan main kai samanthaayen hai
 Both started going to RSS shakhas since childhood and both impressed senior leaders with their passion and skill in their youth
 haalanki shah or modi ke jivan main sabase bada raajnneetik mode tab aayaa, jab unhen gujarat se baahar niklaa gaya
 While Modi was evicted in Gujarat due to growing opposition against him, Shah was disposed off on a court order after being accused in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case
 amit shah abhi us cese main jamaanat par chal rahe hai
 Dozens of Gujarat police officers caught in the same case are in jail
 shah ko jab gujarat se nikaala gaya, tab unhone apana deraa dilli main sthit gujarat bhawan main daalaa
 While staying here, he came close to big leaders of BJP and made way for Modi to come to Delhi
 jab bijepi chunaav ko lekar apni ranneeti bana rahi thi, tab modi or shah jaanate the ki upi jite bina dilli kii kursi paanaa naammumkin jaisaa he
 At that time, Shah did not want to go to UP, but seeing the growing grip of Anandiben Patel and other camps in Gujarat BJP in Gujarat, he accepted this challenge
 baharhaal, party kii upi kii kaman sambhalate hi shah ek rajya ke netaa se rashtriya netaa ban gaye

 Controversial Central Vigilance Commissioner PJ Thomas told the Supreme Court that he was an undisputed honest person and fulfilled all the qualifications for the post after being elected Secretary to the Government
 unhone kaha ki chhante gaye naukarshahon main vah sabase varisht the or mukhya sachiv ke pad par kaam karne vaale ekmaatr vyakti the
 Apart from this, he was cleared by the Central Vigilance Commission in the matter of his name being considered for the post of CVC as prosecution was not allowed against him in the palmolein import case

 a round of Indian cricket passed with the retirement of Mahendra Singh Dhoni from the Test
 aisa daur, jisamen mahendra singh dhoni ne apni manmarjee se bhartiya team ko chalaaya
 During this time, no player was seen around his stature in Indian cricket
 unhen kamyaabi bhi khub mili
 His failures also hid in the shadow of success
 ab jab unhone test se sanyas le liya he, to kya aapako unki koi naakaami yaad aa rahi he
 One look at five occasions where Dhoni not only failed as a captain, but also reduced his own stature
 1-khilaadiyon ke liye uplabdh nahin Mahendra Singh Dhoni may have achieved charismatic success as a captain, but his relations with teammates were not very sweet
 ve apane saathi ke liye uplabdh bhi nahin hote
 This was revealed when VVS Laxman announced his retirement
 bharat ke liye lambey samay tak match vinar khilaadi kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale vivies lakshmana ne jab test cricket se sanyas lene ke masale par dhoni se sampark karnaa chaha, to vah baar-baar koshish karne ke baad bhi kaamyaab nahin hue
 Then VVS Laxman had said, i could not contact Dhoni, he is a busy man
 is masale par dhoni ne kaha tha, mujhase sampark karnaa hameshaa mushkil hota he
 i tried to improve, but it was not possible
 mahendra singh dhoni kii shaadi main bhi team india kii ore se keval suresh raina najar aae the
 2-sehwag, questions on Sachin 2008 main australia main 0-4 se karaari haar ke baad dhoni aalochana ke ghere main the
 The team was also unable to play as expected in the ODI series
 aise main dhoni ne press conference main senior khilaadiyon par nishaanaa sadhakar team ko do guton main vibhakt kar diya
 He questioned the fielding of Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, calling him a slow fielder
 sachin or sahvaag ko lekar dhoni kii olchana par sawaal bhi khub uthe or sahvaag ne field main hi jawaab dene kaa man banaakar behatar kaich lapka, lekin team main daraar aa chuki thi, sahvaag ne yah bhi kaha ki agar dhoni unhen brake dena chaahate hai, to vah captain hai, aisa kar sakate hai
 At that time, there were reports of factionalism and tension in Team India, but it was started by the captain of the team, Dhoni
 3-media se tanatani Mahendra Singh Dhoni's relationship with the media as the captain of Team India has always been tense
 team main gutbaji kii khabaron kaa jawaab dene ke liye unhone 2009 ke tii-20 worldcup ke dauraan puri team india ko press conference main khadaa kar diya
 In 2013, when the controversy over betting and fixing in the IPL deepened, Dhoni took silence in the media over the controversy
 apane antim test siries main bhi pehle unhone khud viraat kohli or shikhar dhawan ke bich tanaav kii baat kahi or uske baad is pahalu par media par kataaksh kiya
 4-name sprung up in betting? mahendra singh dhoni kaa naam ipel sijan 6 kii sattebaazi or spot phixing maamle main bhi uchhla
 Whether his wife Sakshi Rawat was photographed with Vindu Dara Singh or Dhoni's closeness with Gurunath Meiyappan
 in sabane dhoni ko andeh ke ghere main laa diya
 At the same time, the matter of Conflict of Interest was also raised by the Indian cricket team captain and n Srinivasan's job in the company
 itnaa hi nahin team india ke captain or khud kii sports management company chalaane ke liye bhi dhoni kii aalochana hui
 Many players associated with this management company were playing for Team India under Dhoni's captaincy
 5-videshi pich par jeet ko tarase Mahendra Singh Dhoni may be the most successful Test captain of Indian cricket, but under his captaincy, Team India did not do very well on foreign pitches
 unki captaini main team india ne videshi maidaanon par 30 test maichon main captaini kii or team isamen 15 test haar gai
 Dhoni's captaincy on the Australian and England grounds was disappointing
 team india ke captain ke taur par mahendra singh dhoni kii jab jab kamyaabi kii baat hogi, cricket premiyon ko unki ye naakaamiyaan bhi yaad aaengi

 Before the MCD elections, the Delhi High Court dismissed all the petitions on the issue of reservation
 chunaav kii adhisuchana jari karne se pehle dilli chunaav ayog hoicourt ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha
 In fact, many councilors had challenged the State Election Commission formula for SC candidates in the High Court
 in parshadon kaa tark tha ki emsidi bantwaare ke baad agle chunaav ke liye dalit ummidavaaron ke liye jo siten arakshit karne kaa formula he, wo galat he
 According to him, the Delhi Election Commission has made reservation for MCD seats based on the 2001 census, whereas the caste equation of those seats has changed in the last ten years
 toranto ke rico colegium stage main jaise hi pradhanmantri ne yah baat kahi, vahaan jami bharatiyon kii bheed utsaah se bhar gai
 The crowd responded as prominently as the Prime Minister said this
 stadium jayakaare se gunj gaya
 While at the same place, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper was also present, who had also welcomed Manmohan Singh to Canada four years ago
 bheed ne baat kabool kar lee hogi lekin canada ke pradhanmantri ko yah baat kisi lagi hogi
 Not only this, as soon as Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Canada on Wednesday, the highly qualified spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs, Syed Akbaruddin tweeted, which meant that for the first time in 42 years, an Indian Prime Minister is visiting Canada
 yah ek aitihaasik kshan he
 He also used the word 'standalone' in his tweet, which will tell you the meaning of this
 phir bhi yah dharna ban gai ki 42 saal main kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri kaa pehla canada daura he
 Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has objected to this claim and said that the Prime Minister should be careful in choosing facts
 kya aap bhi abhi tak maan rahe the yaa media kii baton se aisa laga ki yah vaaki 42 saal main kisi pradhanmantri kaa yah pehla canada daura he
 There is a mistake in listening to you or the Ministry of External Affairs and the Prime Minister should have said this a little more clearly
 pradhanmantri kii baat ko gaur se dekhenge to koi galati nazar nahin aegi
 Foreign Ministry Spokesman Syed Akbaruddin's tweet will also not see any deficiency
 aap bhi hairaan ho sakate hai ki jis pravaktaa kii itani tarif hoti he, kya usase itani badi chook ho jaaegi
 Would not the Prime Minister, who kept a close watch on everything, also have checked this fact properly
 agar aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki june 2010 main manmohan singh bataur pradhanmantri canada gaye the
 Now this is also a fact, but how the facts are marketed by manipulation of words can be learned from the two Prime Ministers' visit to Canada
 manmohan singh ji-20 ke sammelan main canada gaye the
 He did not go to Canada just to go to Canada like Prime Minister Narendra Modi did
 lekin june 2010 main tamaam rashtradhyakshon ke bich isi pradhanmantri stephen harper ne sirf manmohan singh ke liye alag se raatri bhojan kaa aayojan kiya tha
 Even though Manmohan Singh had gone to the Heads of States Conference, but there was an island-wide discussion between Canada and India and both of them signed a joint statement, there was not a cult
 tippaniyan Some websites have explained the difference of this fact properly, but how much changes in public understanding are made by the difference of one word
 isamen pradhanmantri yaa videsh mantralay kii chook kitni he yaa media kii kitni he ab is vivaad se kya phayda
 Yes, if you want to learn from this, then it should be learned that the audience should also get used to keeping a close watch on the words used by the leaders or spokespersons
 aap hi bataaiye aap 42 saal main pehali baar modi ke canada daure or chaar saal pehle kai deshon ke sammelan ke liye manmohan singh ke daure main kya fark dekhte hai
 You see the difference of 42 years or 4 years
 par ye kissa he bada mazedaarr
 The speaker seems less wrong, the more one understands
 aapke saath herapheri hui yaa aapane samajhane main herpher kar di ye faisalaa aapkaa hona chahie
 By the way, i too have crossed 40 but could not go to Canada
 koi meri bhi to vyathaa sune

 kya aap bhi abhi tak maan rahe the yaa media kii baton se aisa laga ki yah vaaki 42 saal main kisi pradhanmantri kaa yah pehla canada daura he
 There is a mistake in listening to you or the Ministry of External Affairs and the Prime Minister should have said this a little more clearly
 pradhanmantri kii baat ko gaur se dekhenge to koi galati nazar nahin aegi
 Foreign Ministry Spokesman Syed Akbaruddin's tweet will also not see any deficiency
 aap bhi hairaan ho sakate hai ki jis pravaktaa kii itani tarif hoti he, kya usase itani badi chook ho jaaegi
 Would not the Prime Minister, who kept a close watch on everything, also have checked this fact properly
 agar aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki june 2010 main manmohan singh bataur pradhanmantri canada gaye the
 Now this is also a fact, but how the facts are marketed by manipulation of words can be learned from the two Prime Ministers' visit to Canada
 manmohan singh ji-20 ke sammelan main canada gaye the
 He did not go to Canada just to go to Canada like Prime Minister Narendra Modi did
 lekin june 2010 main tamaam rashtradhyakshon ke bich isi pradhanmantri stephen harper ne sirf manmohan singh ke liye alag se raatri bhojan kaa aayojan kiya tha
 Even though Manmohan Singh had gone to the Heads of States Conference, but there was an island-wide discussion between Canada and India and both of them signed a joint statement, there was not a cult
 tippaniyan Some websites have explained the difference of this fact properly, but how much changes in public understanding are made by the difference of one word
 isamen pradhanmantri yaa videsh mantralay kii chook kitni he yaa media kii kitni he ab is vivaad se kya phayda
 Yes, if you want to learn from this, then it should be learned that the audience should also get used to keeping a close watch on the words used by the leaders or spokespersons
 aap hi bataaiye aap 42 saal main pehali baar modi ke canada daure or chaar saal pehle kai deshon ke sammelan ke liye manmohan singh ke daure main kya fark dekhte hai
 You see the difference of 42 years or 4 years
 par ye kissa he bada mazedaarr
 The speaker seems less wrong, the more one understands
 aapke saath herapheri hui yaa aapane samajhane main herpher kar di ye faisalaa aapkaa hona chahie
 By the way, i too have crossed 40 but could not go to Canada

 If you google, you will know that in June 2010, Manmohan Singh went to Canada as Prime Minister
 ab ye bhi ek tathy he lekin shabdon ke her-pher se tathyon kii kaise marketing hoti he, ise donon pradhanmantriyon ke canada daure se siikhaa ja saktaa he
 Manmohan Singh visited Canada at the G-20 conference
 ve sirf canada jane ke liye canada nahin gaye the jaise pradhanmantri narendra modi gaye
 But in June 2010, this Prime Minister Stephen Harper had organized a separate dinner for Manmohan Singh among all the heads of nations
 bhale hi manmohan singh rashtradhyakshon ke sammelan main gaye the lekin canada or bharat ke bich dweepakshiya baat hui or donon ne saajha bayaan par dastakhat bhi kiye, ek panth do kaaj to hua hi na
 The comments kuch websiton ne is tathy ke antar ko thik se samajhaayaa bhi he lekin ek shabd ke fark se saarvajanik rup se samajhadaari main kitna badlaav aa jaataa he
 In this, how much is the lapse of the Prime Minister or the Ministry of External Affairs or how much of the media is there, now what is the use of this controversy
 haa isse agar siikhnaa he to yah baat sikh leni chahie ki netaaon yaa pravaktaaon ke istamaal kiye hue shabdon par darshakon ko bhi baarik nazar rakhane kii aadat daal leni chahie
 You tell me the difference between Modi's visit to Canada for the first time in 42 years and Manmohan Singh's visit to a conference of several countries four years ago
 aapako 42 saal kaa faaslaa dikhaai detaa he yaa 4 saal kaa
 But this story is very funny
 bolne vaala kam galat nazar aata he, samajhane vaala zyada
 You have to be manipulated or you have manipulated your understanding, this decision should be yours
 vaise main bhi 40 ke bahut paar ja chukaa hum magar canada nahin ja sakaa

 As per preliminary information, this building was under construction
 abhi yah bataa paanaa mushkil he ki is haadase main kitne logon kii maut hui he or kitne ghayal hue hai
 Friendship, love and love are the foundation of these relationships
 But girls and women need to be warned that they befriend a stranger, get stuck in their words and trust them and then accept the offer to go on a date
 Huh
 aisi ladkiyaan ab thodi ehtiyaat baratane kii jarurat he, kyonki ho saktaa he ki aapaki pehali date hi aapaki zindagi barbaad kar de

 It is not ten o'clock in the night that every pub and disc of the metro gets crowds of boys and girls of new age
 kai metro is tarah kii party kii giraft main hai jisamen mumbai, bangalore, dilli, pune, chandigarh, goa, kolkata pramukh hai
 Police and Norcotics Control Bureau, Yogesh Deshmukh, Joint Director of Narcotics Control Bureau in Delhi, accepts this and said that nowadays Most of the youth are using drugs
 sutron ke mutabik rev partis kii shuruuaat hindustan main kuch saal pehle goa or mumbai se hui
 Gradually, its intoxication started growing in Bangalore and Delhi's pub culture
 mouj-masti ke liye hone vaali rev parties ab teji se desh main ek lat kii tarah badhati ja rahi he
 But in Mumbai, Delhi, or Bangalore, girls get caught in the trap of rave party, the first meeting with their friend, that is the victim of date rape
 dikkat yah he ki date rape karne waalon kii samay rahete pahchaan kar paanaa sambhav nahin he
 The first trap of intrigue of date rape is being woven through social networking websites on the Internet and the end is a farm house, a deserted house or a nightclub
 mumbai or dilli jaise shaharon main ladakon ke aise kai group hai jo dosti ke naam par soshal netwarking cites par ladki fansaane kaa jaal bunate hai
 There was no friendship on the internet that the transaction of mobile numbers does not take long and once the mobile number arrives, then the round of misguided talk started on the mobile
 ladki se dosti or phir pyaar kaa izhaar hone ke baad date rape ke maahir ladke acha impresssont dikhaane ke liye pehali mulaakaat jaan-boojh kar saarvajanik jagahon yaa phir restaurant main karte hai
 There is little faith in the girl's heart that then a conspiracy to call the victim to the farm house or to such a deserted hideout on the pretext of party
 yani ladkaa,ladki ko kisi bahaane farm house yaa phir bangale par bulaata he
 Some other friends are also called to win the trust, so that the girl does not return to the opposite leg after seeing solitude
 ladki ko puri tarah vishwaas main lene ke liye berth de kek bhi katataa he or phir mouj-masti kaa daur shuru hota he
 After a round of drums and jams, when the crowd starts sorting, the date rape hunters and their hunting girl escape
 ladki jab ek-do jam le chuki hoti he to dhire se uske gilaas main drugs kii do boond mila di jaati he
 Shortly after taking drinks, the girl starts getting drunk
 date par bulaakar kisi ladki ke saath rape karne ke liye jin drugs kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he, wo dawa kii dukaanon par dhadlle se bik rahi hai
 Usually, in the parties where the plot of date rape is hatched, even these drugs are arranged in advance
 ye drugs behad khatarnaak he
 Their mere two drops or one tablet is enough to make a girl drunk to the extent of helplessness in fifteen minutes
 drinks main 'ketamine hydrochloride' kii do boond milaai jaati hai
 In the country, it is used as an anesthesia of animals
 ketamine main neend kii dawa velium se bees guna zyada takat he
 Ketamine is available at different medical stores
 catamine ke alaava date rape main istemaal hoti he 'ropenul' jise 'lav drugs' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Ropenol, sold under the brand name of 'flunitrazapam', is considered to be the most effective drug for plotting a date rape
 ek or drugs he 'jiechabi' yani 'gamma hydro butirik acid', jiskaa naa rang he, naa swaad or naa hi koi gandh
 But as soon as they get down from the throat, this drug becomes addictive
 jaankaron ke mutabik, date rape main shikaar ko jo drugs drinks main milakar diye jate hai unka asar kaaphi teji se hota he
 These drugs affect a girl in ten minutes
 in dawaaon kaa asar saat se aath ghante tak rahata he
 Due to the effect of the drug, the girl's memory becomes weak and she does not remember the misdeeds with her
 jaahir taur par yaaddaasht kii kamajori or logon ke dar se ladkiyaan aise maamle darj karne se kataraa jaati hai
 But this incident has a huge impact on the hearts and minds of girls
 mahanagaron main ladakiyon or mahilaon ke saath date rape kaa khatra gaharaa gaya he
 The problem is that due to apprehension, she can neither get away from friends nor from birthday or any other party on the call of a friend
 beshak aap party main jaaen, nite club main jaaen, lekin hameshaa chaukanna rahen
 According to experts, if girls take a little precaution, then by attending such parties, they can avoid the risk of date rape
 1
 Instead of going to a party alone or with only one boy, go in groups
 2
 There must be one or two people in the group that you have complete confidence in
 3
 Instead of drinking wine at the party, take juice or drinks in the can
 4
 If you are drinking alcohol, then keep your glass in your hand and make a peg in front of you
 5
 Instead of the farm house, party in the disc or bar of the big hotel
 6
 While returning from the party, do not take a lift from anyone but take a drop with your friends of faith
 7
 Keep the number of the radio taxi in the mobile and use the radio taxi at the time of emergency
 8
 If you feel a little dizzy at the time of the party or feel a change in your health, then immediately leave the party with your group
 philhal desh main date rape or dhokhe se drugs khilaane ke badhate chalan par shikanja kasne ke liye jaanch agenciyaan or sarkaar donon hi gambhir hai
 In this case, where the investigating agencies are engaged in tightening legal shingles on the makers of debt rape drugs, the government is also formulating a new policy to prevent youths from becoming victims of drugs by using social participation
 hindustan main jis vakt log aisi vaardaaton ko filmi kalpana maan rahe the, un dinon america main date rape ke maamle itane bad chuke the ki 1996 main date rape se nipatane ke liye kanoon banane kii naubat aa gai
 In 1996, US President Bill Clinton signed the 'drug Induced Rape Prevention and Punishment Act'
 is kanoon ke tahat 'ropenul' naam ke drug ke istemaal par pabandi laga di gai
 Four years later, drugs called 'GHB' were also included in the ambit of this law, because these drugs were the most used in the US for date rape
 america main ab in donon drugs kaa istemaal karne vaale ko 20 saal tak kaid kii sazaa ho sakati he

 muniraka main rahane vaali sadhana bataati hai ki aam aadmi party ke aane se bijli ke rate main unke liye bhi koi antar nahin aayaa
 Earlier, 8 rupees had to be paid and even now
 bhala makaan maalik se musibat koun mol le
 Sadhana hardly spends 100 units every month, but the landlord charges a rate of 8 rupees only

 Energy expert Rajiv Kakaria says that there are about 4
3 million meters in Delhi
 isamen se kareeb 30 se 32 lakh meter domestic upabhoktaaon ke hai
 Suppose that approximately 5 lakh people have hired tenants
 in 5 lakh logon ne ausatan 4-4 kamare bhi kirayedaron ko diya hua ho to 20 lakh sab meter
 In such a situation, suppose that 20 lakh common people are deprived of it

 From the ramparts of the historic Red Fort, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan in two words that if he does not stop the use of his land for terror activities against India, then the conversation with him will not go much further
 pradhanmantri ne desh ke 64wein swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par lagaataar saatven varsh dhwajarohan ke baad raashtra ke naam apane sambodhan main kaha, ‘‘ham apane padosi deshon se aman-chaiyn or khushhaali chaahate hai
 Whatever differences we have with neighboring countries, we want to resolve them through dialogue
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘jahaan tak pakistan kaa taalluk he ki ham usase ummid karte hai ki vah apni jameen kaa istemaal bharat ke khilaaf dehshatgardi kii gatividhiyon ke liye nahin hone degaa
 We have been emphasizing this in all our interactions with Pakistan
 agar aisa nahin hota he to baatcheet kaa koi bhi silsilaa bahut aage nahin bad paaegaa
 "on this occasion, the Prime Minister also offered talks with people and groups of Jammu and Kashmir, Maoists and those from the Northeast who are willing to give up the path of violence
" pradhanmantri ne is baar apane bhaashan main kisi naye kaarykram kii ghoshnaa se inkaar karte hue kaha, ‘‘aaj hamen apane makasad tak pahunchane ke liye bahut se naye kaarykram shuru karne kii jarurat nahin he, balki jarurat is baat kii he ki jo yojanaayen hamane shuru kii hai unhen ham adhik prabhavi dhang se lagu karen jinase unamem bhrashtachar or sarkari dhan ke durupyog kii gunjaaish na rahane paae
 Describing Naxalism as a serious problem for internal security, the Prime Minister appealed to the Naxalites to leave the path of violence and negotiate with the government, while warning that those who take the path of violence will be strictly dealt with
 unhone pichley kuch dinon main naksali hamalon main shahid hue suraksha balon ke javaanon or adhikariyon ko shradhanjali dete hue kaha, ‘‘maine pehle bhi kaha he or aaj phir kahata hum ki hamaari sarkaar apane harek naagarik kii suraksha kii jimmedaari ko puraa karne main koi kami nahin aane degi
 We will deal strictly with those who take the path of violence
 naksal prabhavit kshetron main kanoon kaa raaj kaayam rakhane ke liye ham rajya sarkaron kii har tarah se madad karenge
 "manmohan Singh said," i once again appeal to the Naxalites to leave the path of violence and negotiate with the government and join us in accelerating social and economic development
 ’’ unhone kaha ki kuch din pehle naksal prabhavit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ke saath baatcheet main naksalwad se nipatane ke liye jo sahmati bani he us par centre sarkaar puri tarah amal karegi
 The Prime Minister said that the Center and the States will have to work unitedly to face the challenge of Naxalism
 centre ke sahyog or rajyon ke aapasi talmail ke bina is gambhir samasya se nipatna kisi bhi rajya ke liye bahut mushkil he
 He said, "we all need to rise above our personal and political interests and face this challenge
 ’’pichley kuch dinon se ugr andolanon ke shikaar jammu kashmir ke bare main pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘‘kashmir bharat kaa ek abhinn hissaa he
 Within this radius, we are ready to pursue every such conversation, so that the common man of Jammu and Kashmir can increase his share of power and convenience
 ’’ unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar jammu-kashmir main har us vyakti yaa gut se baatcheet karne ko taiyaar he jo hinsa kaa rasta chhod de
 Manmohan Singh said that recently some youths have been killed in bloodshed in Jammu and Kashmir, which they deeply regret
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘‘barason ke khun-kharabe kaa ab ant hona chahie
 Nobody is going to get anything from this bloodshed
 ’’ unhone kaha ki bhartiya loktantr main itani udaartaa he ki vah kisi bhi hisse or gut kii mushkilon ko hal kar sake
 Singh said that recently he has held a meeting with political parties of Jammu and Kashmir and he will try to take this matter further
 pradhanmantri ne jammu-kashmir or purvottar ke nivaasiyon se kaha ki ve loktantric taur-tareekon se apni or desh kii behatari ke liye hamaare saath milakar kaam karen
 In the context of the northeastern states, he said that his government has a special responsibility towards him, which is being tried to fulfill it
 singh ne purvottar ke sabhi raajnneetik dalon or guton se kaha ki praant yaa kabeelon ke naam par vivaad karne se ham sabakaa nuksaan hi hoga
 Negotiation is the only way to resolve complex issues
 unhone kaha, ‘‘jahaan tak centre sarkaar kaa sawaal he ham aisi har baatcheet ke silsile ko badhaava dene ke liye taiyaar hai, jisase samasyaon ko sulajhane kii disha main aage badha ja sake
 Regarding inflation, the Prime Minister said, "I know that for the last few months you are troubled by rising prices
" badhati keemton kaa sabase zyada asar hamaari garib janata par padataa he, khaastaur par jab anaaj, daal, sabji jaisi rosemara kii chizon ke daam badhate hai
 "he said," We are making every possible effort to reduce inflation and i am confident that we will also get success
 ’’ pradhanmantri ucch shiksha or chikitsa ke kshetron main do alag-alag parishaden gathit kiye jane ke liye sarkaar dwaara sheeghra hi sansad main vidheyak laane kii ghoshnaa kii
 He said that this is being done under measures to improve these areas
 unhone kaha ki ye do kshetra sarkaar ke samahit vikaas kii sudhaar ranneeti kaa mahatvapurn ang hai
 Manmohan Singh admitted that since independence, these two areas have not received as much attention as was needed
 unhone kaha ki in donon kshetron ke liye unki sarkaar ne jo nayi yojanaayen pichley chah saalon main shuru kii hai unhen puri mehnat or eemaandaaree se rajya sarkaron ke sahyog se lagu kiya jaataa rahegaa
 The Prime Minister asked to avoid incidents of divisions in society in the name of religion, province, caste and language
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamen sakanlp karnaa chahie ki ham kisi bhi haalat main apane samaaj ko bantane nahin denge
 "he said," Generosity and tolerance are part of our tradition
 We need to strengthen this tradition further
 aarthik vikaas ke saath-saath hamaare samaaj kii samvedansheeltaa bhi badhani chahie
 Our ideology should be modern and progressive
 ’’pradhanmantri ne sweekaar kiya ki krishi vikaas ke lakshya puure nahin kiye ja sake hai
 He said, "our agricultural growth rate has increased a lot in the last few years, but we are still far from our target
 bharat ke krishi vikaas kii dar ko chaar pratishat tak pahunchaa sakane main hamen or kadi mehnat karne kii jarurat he
 He said that after the Green Revolution, there has been no major technological change in the agricultural sector of the country
 unhone kaha ki khaadya suraksha pukhta karne ke liye hamen shushk bhoomi krishi kii jaruraton ko dhyaan main rakhana hoga or badalte mausam, pani ke girte str, bhoomi kii ghatati gunvattta jaisi nayi chunautiyon se bhi nipatna hoga
 The Prime Minister said that Norman Borlaug has a special place in the search for new and more productive seeds of wheat in the first Green Revolution of the country and once again Borlaug Institute for South Asia is being established to give a boost to India's agriculture
 
 dharmanirpekshata ko loktantr kii aadharshila bataate hue singh ne kaha ki sabhi dharmon ko baraabar kaa darja dena or unka aadar karnaa hamaare desh or samaaj kii parampara rahi he
 He said that secularism is also our constitutional responsibility and his government is committed to creating communal harmony and peace
 jalwaayu paritarvan ke sandarbh main unhone prakritik sansadhano kaa saavdhaanee or kifayat se istemaal karne kii apil karte hue kaha ki aane vaali pidiyon ke liye apane jangalon, nadiyon, pahaado kii suraksha karnaa hamaari khaas jimmedaari he
 On this occasion, the Prime Minister acknowledged that there are many deficiencies in the country's infrastructure which have a very bad effect on our economic development and it needs to be removed

 bavana upachunaavamein aam aadmi party kii jeet ke baad party ko bijepi ke haathon north emsidi main ranneetik taur par haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 In terms of numbers, the Aam Aadmi Party had prepared its board in Narela zone of North Delhi Municipal Corporation
 iske liye party ne alderman kaa bhi sahaara liya, lekin ant main bijepi ne baaji apane paksh main palat lee
 As a result, all the posts of Narela Zone Committee were held by BJP corporators
 narela zone main samiti ke adhyaksh pad par bijepi parshad sunit chouhan chun liye gaye hai
 Sunit Chauhan was elected through a lottery, as both parties had 11–11 councilors in the zone
 upaadhyaksh pad par bijepi kii hi parshad nisha maan lard rahi thi, lekin bijepi ne bispi ke parshad jayabhagwan ko apane paale main kar liya or upaadhyaksh pad par nisha maan kaa namakan waapas karakar jayabhagwan ko jeeta diya
 With this, Anand Singh of BJP was elected as a member of the Standing Committee
 emsidi chunaav ke baad yahaan parshadon kaa aankada aisa tha ki bahumat ke aadhaar par bijepi apana board bana sakati thi
 Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party-ruled Delhi government nominated six alderman in the Narela zone
 isse zone main aap ke parshadon kii sankhya bad gai or aap bahumat main aa gai
 However, the last bet was overturned by the BJP by bringing the BSP councilor in its court

 Secularist-politics takes its place by calling the people who have come out in protest against the film 'PK' as sanghi-bajrangi
 aaj shaam ko isi maamle par bandanvaaj dadhidraj secularadaas se meri bhidant ho gai
 The interesting thing is that they did not deviate at all as if already prepared
 maine kaha,'aaj aapkaa intervyuu luungaa
 Speak to Vetpak, ask questions
 main sahamate hue ek saath anek sawaal bak gaya
 
 
 1
 ye 'pike' virdohi jamaat paidaa hi kyon hui? pichley kuch saalon main isaki taadaad or takat itani bad kaise gai?2
 How would the Delhi riots be secular and Gujarat riots community? 3
 kashmir se bhagaae hindu communal or batch gaye musalmaan secular kaise hote?4
 Why did the area of the sole Muslim majority population remain a secular spectator of insults, murders and rapes of its Hindu realities? 5
 ek hi kaam ke liye musalmaan secular or hindu communal kaha jaataa rahaa maanon har 'khan' secular or 'singh' communal ho?6
 What does the silence on Taslima Nasreen and Rushdie and the ruckus on Hussain and 'PK' prove? 7
 secular-communal shabd aaj kyon majaak kaa vishay ban gaye hai ?sawaal khatm hote-hote main thak sa gaya, lekin secularadaas avichal rahe
 Gave me water with my hands
 tu thodi saans le le
 Then the values started as tapericarders
 in bajrangi bhaaiyon kii vartmaan paidaavaar kii jameen he bhartiya manisha se kate padhe-likhe log jinaki buddhi ke andey se sirf andey nikalate, chuje nahin
 Like the 'island of the river' cut off from reality, but like Amarlatti, these people who cover the intellectual world and deprive them of open air and light, are proven to make 'tha' as 'na' and 'na' as 'tha'
 agar is sthiti ko thik nahin kiya gaya to mobile or internet hinduon ke swayambhu 'islamic morche' itani badi taadaad main khadey kar denge ki uske saamne bajrang dal or vishwa hindu parishad pani bharen
 i habitually interrupted - wonder that even when using technology, this section remained unaware of its far-reaching effect like an ostrich
 secularadaas aaj is tokataki ke liye taiyaar nahin dikhe
 Then he came in awe
 dashakon se jhooth kii kheti kar uskaa asal inam paane kaa abhyast yah tabaka samasya kaa moulik samaadhaan karne main apane ko aksham maan chukaa he vaise hi jaise kuch saal angreji main padhai-likhaai karne vaala hindi bhashi yah samajhataa he ki ab vah hindi main thik se apni baat nahin kah saktaa
 i am afraid that this section of intellectualism does not become the object of ridicule in front of the new generation and then in response the 'islamization' (kattarisation) of Hindus should not take the shape of a strong movement
 kya main kuch boluun, bahut dhire se maine poocha
 He said no
 bas yahi samaj lo ki aaj secularadaas kii yahi traasadee he
 (dr
 chandrakant prasad singh ke blog'you and me'se saabhaar) Whether black money is in cash or gold, sown in the ground or buildings are erected, how much soot will come out of demonetisation, there should be a discussion among these speculations about where black money is being made and why
 
 kaali kamai ke maamle main ham nihaayat dilachasp desh ho chale hai
 Honest people are beating up the police to withdraw their savings, while on the other hand, who have the hand of the government's campaign, their record in terms of transparency is the most dubious in India
 bank or tex vibhaag modi sarkaar ke swatchta abhiyaan ke shubhankar hai, lekin kaale dhan kii paidaavaar main sabase badi bhoomika tex system kii he or ise chhipaane yaa dhulaane main banking va vittiya tantra sabase kargar he or yahi donon eemaandaaree ke certificate baant rahe hai
 All studies and the 2012 Government White Paper on Black Money believe that India's tax system is the root cause of black money
 zyaadaatar tex khapat par lagate hai jo vyapaar par aadhaarit he isliye trade kaale dhan kaa nirmaataa bhi he, dharak bhi or shikaar bhi
 a large part of the trade in India is based on cash, so most of the unaccounted cash (which is not completely black money) is in trade
 kuch aankadon par gaur farmana jaruri haivyapaar va usase judi gatividhiyaan, masalan, transport va vibhinn vittiya sevaayen jidipi main 30-35 fisadi hissaa rakhti hai
 This is double the share of agriculture in GDP, 10% more than the share of industry
 12 fisadi arthvyavastha nakad par chalati he
 Most of the trade is in cash
 karj par nirbharta simit he isliye vyapaar kaa apana credit system (udhari) he, jisamen thok kharid pehle hoti he or bhugtan baad main
 Through this, traders balance the cash flow
 rajasav kaa bada hissaa upbhog par lagane vaale taxon se aata he
 Most of the tax collection is directly or indirectly business oriented
 bharat upbhog par sabase adhik tex lagane vaale deshon main he
 Income tax rates are also high
 adhikansh kaala dhan khapat yani trade par lagane vaale taxon kii chori se banataa he
 Traders want to pay tax but theft occurs because the one-off business costs are high, the tax burden limits profit margins, the capacity of the tax system is very limited in the face of two-consumption gaps and the compliance of three-tax rules The cost of compliance is very high
 yahi vajah he ki vyapaar kaa munafa tex chori se nikalataa he, jisamen bhrasht tex system madadgaar he
 Banks and financial services are also not far behind
 bank na keval aam logon kii jamaa puunji ko bade korporate karjon main dubaane ke liye kukhyat hai balki notebandi ke baad in bainkon main kaale dhan kii dhulaai se rigerv bank bhi pareshaan he
 On a large scale, black money is produced through legal activities
 korporate, cells or kaarobaari accounting main darjanon raste chhipe hai
 Paper companies, out-of-book transactions, cash in hand, multiple account books, a lot of black money are rotated, consumed and hidden by showing low production, increased spending, manipulating sales receipts
 acounting kaa yah makadzaal bainkon kii nigaah main he kyonki adhiktar kaarobaari gatividhiyon kaa koi na koi hissaa bainkon ke network main he
 The journey to reach black money leaders and officials made up of tax evasion and fake accounting is interesting
 bharat kaa adhikansh bhrashtachar sevaaon va suvidhaon kii kami se upja he
 After liberalization, their demand increased, not supply
 railway rigerveshan se lekar anaapatti pramaan patr tak, skool daakhile se lekar makaan banane tak har jagah sevaaon kii maang va aapurti main baari antar he
 Where this difference decreased, corruption (telephones, gas, cars) ended
 is killat ke bich afasar or netaaon kii ek choti-si jamaat ke paas akut takat he, jo behad saamaanya suvidhaayen dene se lekar haq or nyaay baantne tak faili he
 Many surveys on corruption have been reported that 76 per cent of bribes in India 2
 5 lakh ru
 Is less than
 77 fisadi rishwat kaam vakt par karaane yaa kaarobaari nuksaan se bachane ke liye di jaati he
 Industry and trade are the most frequent needs for saving business losses and taking a competitive edge
 yahi vajah he ki tex chori se bana kaala dhan netaa-adhikariyon tak pahunchataa he, jo avasar baantne ke adhikaron se las hai
 India's rank 130 among 189 countries in Ease of Doing Business rankings and 187th in terms of tax
 yahi kathinaaiyaan rishwaton kaa aadhaar banati hai
 Governments in India spend offhand
 unhen khub oonchi dar par tex or khub karj chahie
 This is the reason why banks and taxes are the most important but inferior link of the entire system
 bade note band karne se arthvyavastha isliye thap he kyonki trade band he jo arthvyavastha kaa ingine he or is ingine kaa eendhan nakadi (cash jidipi reshio) he
 We do not know how India's large business system, which is also bjp's voter, will react to the government's decision, but it is well known that the business economy is badly broken
 iske cash or credit flo ko baari nuksaan hua he
 With this decision raids of income tax, excise have started
 isse andaja lagata he ki aane vaale vakt main inspector raaj kai guna bad saktaa he
 Equipped with multiple tax rates and dozens of registration registrations, GST is starting to scare rather than assure
 bade note band hone se kaala dhan ghatane kii guarantee nahin he
 For this, cleanliness of the banking system and reduction and ease of tax is necessary
 nahin to rishwatein chalati rahengi or kaala dhan banataa-khapata rahegaa
 At the moment, demonetisation has severely affected only trade, consumption and employment

 Today, the market showed pressure for the third consecutive day since the budget
 puure din utaar chadhaav ke baad sensex or nifti daayre main band hue
 The Sensex gained 10 points to 38731 while the Nifty lost 3 points and closed at 11556

 In the two days after the presentation of the general budget, the SENSEX dropped by about 1200 points
 is dauraan niveshkon ko 5 lakh karod se adhik kii chapat lagane kaa anumaan he
 What is the reason for the decline The stock market has fallen so much due to lack of announcement in the general budget of the Modi government
 bazaar ke jaankaar bataate hai ki sarkaar dwaara share bybech par tex lagane or listed companiyon main nunatam public sharholding badhaane kii ghoshnaa se gharelu niveshkon main niraashaa kaa maahaul bana he
 In fact, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the full budget of the current financial year 2019-20 in the Lok Sabha, proposed to increase the minimum public shareholding in listed companies from 25 percent to 35 percent
 iske alaava, bybech par 20 fisadi tex lagane kaa bhi prastaav kiya gaya he
 Also, a strong trend in Asian markets led to a negative trend in the US as the US central bank Federal Reserve reduced interest rate cuts on the back of strong job data last week

 inke alaava nath sampradaay ke netaa baba gorakhnath or nath sampradaay ke sant baba gambhirnath ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 It is interesting that the chief priest of Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur is the Chief Minister of the state

 haalanki kuch vidwaan maanate hai ki unka pradurbhaav san 1398 main hua
 He is also known as Raidas

 It is said that Sikandar Lodi, influenced by his fame, sent him an invitation to come to Delhi, but he politely declined
 madhyayugin saadhakon main ravidasji kaa vishisht sthaan he
 There is a discussion in the saint literature that Ravidasji, like Kabir, has a special place among the leading poets of high quality
 swayan kabirdaas ji ne 'santan main ravidaas' kahkar inhen manyata di he
 Sant Ravidasji was a staunch opponent of hypocrisy and externalism
 ve murtipuja, tirthayatra aadi main bilkul yakeen nahin karte the
 They considered the free spirit and mutual brotherhood of the person as the true religion
 yahi kaaran he ki ravidasji kii kavy-rachanaaon main saralata ke saath vyaavhaarikta kaa samarthan miltaa he

 rahul dholkia nirdeshit film main navazuddin siddiki bhi hai
 Pakistani actress Mahira Khan is making her Bollywood debut with this film
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Before leaving for the West Indies tour, Team India captain Virat Kohli was asked in a press conference that he was rested for the ODI and T20 series, so how did he suddenly get ready for this
 bataa den ki bich world cap achaanak 23 june ko khabar ai thi ki indies daure kii tii-20 or vanade siries main viraat kohli ne bisisiai se aaraam maang liya he
 But after the semi-final defeat ended the World Cup journey, he agreed to tour the Indies
 yah khabaren bhi ai thi ki viraat kohli yadi westeindies daure main tii-20 or vanade team se nahin judate, to captain ke rup main ek baar phir rohit sharma ko mauka mil saktaa tha
 Whenever Rohit got command in Virat's absence, he captained Team India better
 saath hi bisisiai ke sutron se yah khabar bhi mili thi ki board limited overon kii cricket main ek alag captain banane par vichaar kar rahaa he
 It was believed that perhaps this forced Virat to play the entire tour
 lekin somvaar ko mumbai main yojit press conference main team india ke captain viraat kohli ne saaf kiya ki team ke purv physio yaa trainer main se kisi ne unase nahin kaha ki westeindies daure par unhen aaraam ke liye limited overon kii cricket nahin khelni chahie
 There were reports that Jasprit Bumrah and Kohli would be rested, but Kohli said that no one told him that his workload exceeded the prescribed limit
 kohli ne kaha, ‘hamaara aaraam ke samay kaa puraa record rahata he
 All remains on the email given to the board
 mujhe nahin pataa ki kya report banaai gai he
 i don't know until the physio or trainer says to me
 mujhe nahin pataa ki chayankartaaon ko kya email bheja gaya, kyonki mujhase aaraam ke liye nahin kaha gaya
 'rohit Sharma stood ready for captaincy! If Virat Kohli did not join T20 and ODI team in West Indies tour, Rohit Sharma would have got a chance as captain again
 world cap main haar ke baad yah maang bhi uthne lagi thi ki rohit sharma ko vanade or tii-20 kaa captain bana diya jaae
 It is noteworthy that whenever Rohit got the command in the absence of Virat, he made Team India the champion
 aise main viraat kohli ne apni captaini ko brake dena uchit nahin samajha or daure ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 Whenever he got a chance - Rohit 'did it' In September last year, Virat Kohli took a rest in the Asia Cup tournament played in the UAE
 jiske baad rohit sharma kii captaini main bharat ne yah toornament jeeta
 Earlier, in March 2018, Virat also went on a break in the TRAI T20 series played in Sri Lanka
 rohit ne is toornament (nidahaas trophy) ko bhi jitkar apni captaini kaa loha manvaaya tha
 As captain, Rohit has won 8 out of 10 odis so far, while he has won 12 out of 15 matches in T20 Internationals
 maje kii baat he ki tii-20 international main viraat kohli ne bhi 12 match jitaaye hai, lekin 22 match khelkar
 Anna Hazare has said that after his release from Tihar Jail on August 16, the government had plans to send him to his ancestral village

 Emily believes that every couple understands how to raise a family
 agar parivaar badhaane main kuch deree ho rahi he to iske kuch nijee kaaran bhi ho sakate hai
 Posting a photo of the ultrasound, Emily wrote, "people should not ask any new couple when they will raise their family, or ask the parents of a young child when their brother or sister is coming

 chhattisgarh main aatmasamarpan karne vaale kukhyat naksali leader pahaad singh se teen rajyon kipulicepoochtacha karegi
 In addition to Chhattisgarh, a prize money of one crore has been executed in many major incidents in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra
 bhilai main chhattisgarh police keepuchhatachhamen usne kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye hai
 He has also told the plan to the police about the big Naxalite conspiracy during the election
 pahaad singh naksaliyon kii jonal cameti kaa pramukh tha or pichley 20 varshon se kai naksali gatividhiyon main shaamil tha
 Let me tell you that under the protection of more than half a dozen jihadnaxligman, the Naxalite commander Pahar Singh, who has become synonymous with red terror in the border of Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, surrendered to IG GP Singh of Durg Range
 police ise apni badi kamyaabi maan rahi he
 This surrender took place at a time when the security forces in Bastar have put a lot of pressure on the Naxalites
 duusari ore naksaliyon ne is dabaav se bachane ke liye in teenon rajyon kii sarhad ko apana surakshit thikaana banane kii pahal shuru kii thi
 Naxalites formed their new zones on this border in Balaghat, Rajnandgaon, Gondia and Gadchiroli
 isaki jimmedaari pahaad singh par thi, lekin bade naksali netaaon kii karypranali se naaraaz pahaad singh aatmasamarpan karke desh kii mukhyadhara se jud gaya
 Naxalleeder Pahar Singh alias Kumar Sai alias Ram Mohan Singh Toppo had a reward of Rs 47 lakh only in Chhattisgarh
 teenon rajyon main inaam kii raashi ek karod se upar bataai ja rahi he
 IG GP Singh said that Pahar Singh has done many big incidents in all three states
 vah jiarabi divijan kaa sachiv tha
 Police had been looking for him for a long time, but he escaped every time during a search operation
 police or suraksha bal ke javaanon ko chakma dene main wo kaaphi maahir he
 According to IG GP Singh, the Naxalites were getting stronger after Pahar Singh became the Secretary of Special Zonal Committee of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, but now this surrender has also destroyed their aspirations
 unhone kaha ki iskaa samarpan police kii badi safalataa or naksali sanghathan ke liye bada jhatka he
 This will not only break the back of the Naxalites, but will also adversely affect their campaigns during the elections
 pahaad singh mul rup se rajanandgaanv ke fafamar gaanv kaa rahane vaala he
 IG GP Singh said that Pahar Singh was suffering from the genocide with the tribals
 unhone bataaya ki naksali adivaasiyon par kabhi police mukhabiri kaa aarope lagaakar to kabhi unke andolan main hissaa nahin lene par unhen maut ke ghat utaar rahe hai
 Hurt by this, Pahar Singh surrendered
 unhone kaha ki pahaad singh ke mukhyadhara main lautne se naksali memasi ko bada jhatka laga he
 Pahar Singh is also a good speaker
 is vajah se logon kii baithke lekar unhen apane sanghathan main jodne main bhi vah maahir he
 Naxalite organizations were still taking advantage of this
 aatmasamarpan ke baad pahaad singh ne bhi naksaliyon ko unke kaaryon ke liye jamkar latada
 He admitted that he became a Naxalite 20 years ago, influenced by the Naxalite ideology, but now Naxalism has completely deviated
 naksali ab apradhi maane jate hai or lut-khasot ke liye jane jate hai
 So she decided to leave him

 Skill development, education, loan availability will play an important role in this strategy
 ’kendriya mantri ne kaha ki alpsankhyakon ke kalyaan se judi yojanaon kii prakriyaayein kaaphi jatil hai jinhen saamaanya vyakti puraa nahin kar paa rahaa he
 The Ministry is simplifying these procedures
 centre sarkaar dwaara yah pahal aise samay main kii ja rahi he jab sachhar samiti kii report ke anusaar, muslim samudaay ke 6 se 14 varsh ke ek chauthai bachche bich main hi skool chhod dete hai or inamen se kaaphi schuli shiksha ke daayre se baahar hai

 -input language chunaav, bihar or jati factor- ye teenon ek-duusare ke paryaay hon jaise
 There cannot be a thought that elections should be held in Bihar and there is no talk of caste mathematics
 bhale hi loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye tamaam partiyaan endie or mahagathbandhan ke do khemon main bant gai hon lekin siyaasi guna-ganit, siton ke bantwaare or ummidavaaron ke chayan main sabase bada factor is baar bhi jati hi dikh rahaa he
 Due to caste-based politics, there is a growing trend within the camps and against the camps
 bihar main dhai sau se bhi adhik jatiyaan-upjatiyaan hai
 All the parties in the battle of 40 Lok Sabha seats of the state have distributed tickets or fielded candidates according to the population and the mathematics of the seats
 kis party se kis jati ko kitne tikat?endie bihar kii 40 siton main se 39 par ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar chukaa he
 While the Grand Alliance has so far been able to decide the names of 33 candidates
 endie ne 'saamaanya varg' ke 13 logon ko tikat diya he
 Of these, 7 are from Rajput community, 3 from Bhumihar caste, two Brahmins and one candidate from Kayastha caste
 12 ummidavaar obisi samudaay se hai
 Of which 5 are from Yadav, 3 Kushwaha, 3 Vaishya and one Kurmi caste
 ati pichhadaa varg ke 7 ummidavaar hai, jinamein dhanuk, kevat, gangeyi, gonsai, nishad, gangota or chandravanshi ke ek-ek ummidavaar hai
 There are 6 Dalit candidates, including 4 Paswan while Ravivas and 1-1 candidates of Mushar caste
 vahiin, mahagathbandhan kaa jatiy ganit kuch alag he
 RJD is focusing on M-Y equation ie Lalu's old yadav-muslim formula
 argedy ne apane khate kii 19 loksabhaa siton main se 18 siton par ummidavaaron kaa elaan kar diya he, jinamein se sabase zyada 8 yadav, 4 muslim, 3 rajput, 2 dalit or 1 seat par atipichhadaa ummidavaar utaara he
 At the same time, Congress is contesting on 9 seats
 inamen se patna se shatrughna sinha(kysth)
 Uda Singh aka Pappu Singh from Purnia, Tariq Anwar from Katihar have given the chance
 ralospa ne abhi apane ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan nahin kiya he
 But the social equation of candidature has been revealed
 ralospa kaa kahana he ki pashchimi champaran se kushvaha, purvi champaran se savarna, karakaat se kushvaha, jamui se anusuchit jati or ujiyarpur se kushvaha samudaay ke logon ko tikat diya jayega
 What is the strength of which caste in Bihar? If you look at the caste strength of vote in Bihar, which is famous for caste-based politics, the OBC community has the largest population - 51 percent
 14
 4% Yadav community, Kushwaha i
e
 Koiri 6
 4%, kurmi 4% hai
 Dalits are 16 percent
 savarnon kii aabaadi 17% he jinamein se bhoomihaar 4
 7%, Brahmin 5

 2% and Kayastha 1

 The Muslim community in the state has a population of 16
 9% he
 The three-point formula of the NDA is that the parties involved in both the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan camps have their respective votes
 endie main shaamil hai- bijepi, jediu or algepi
 The NDA is confident of its three-point formula, that is, the three parties will use three different equations
 bijepi kii savarna voton par acchhee pakad maani jaati he
 Similarly, BJP is also playing on the front foot for Yadav votes
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh nityanand raay yadav samudaay se aate hai
 bjp's Bihar in-charge Bhupendra Yadav also belongs to this community
 lalu kii anupasthiti main argedy voton ko saadhane par bijepi ne focus kiya he
 Whereas Nitish Kumar has good penetration among jdu's Kurmi community and Pasmanda Muslims
 vahiin ramvilas paswan kii party algepi daliton kii siyasat karti he
 The M-Y equation of the RJD + the upper caste bet of the Congress is also its own caste arithmetic for the Grand Alliance
 mahagathbandhan main 5 dal shaamil hai- argedy, congress, upendra kushvaha kii ralospa, mukesh sahani kii viipi party or jeethanram maanjhi kii ham
 RJD Yadav holds the votes
 haalanki lalu yadav ke jail main hone ke kaaran tejasvi par sara daaromadar he
 The Congress is focused on upper caste votes
 mallaah voton par mukesh sahani, koiri yani kushvaha voton par upendra kushvaha daavedaari pesh kar rahe hai jabaki dalit voton ko saadhane ke liye jeethanram maanjhi maidan main hai
 In 14 seats in the candidates of the same caste, directly contest the votes, see that in 14 of the 40 seats in the state, all parties have put candidates of the same caste face to face

 The Pasmanda Muslims are eyeing a coalition, but in the name of Modi's opposition, they are eyeing Muslim votes, but the Pasmanda Muslims' resentment may outweigh them

 Despite this, there is not a single Pasmanda name in the list of Mahagathbandhan candidates

 Dinesh Karthik has never made so much headlines in a 14-year long international cricket career, as in just one night
 aakhir kyon nahin
 
 ! unhone world record jo kaayam kar diya
 The 32-year-old Karthik became the first batsman to win the team by hitting a six off the last ball of the last over of the T20 International when 5 or more runs were required
 is ek saahasik pari ne unhen 'vijeta' bana diya
 Karthik's winning six on the last ball, Miandad's 32-year-old spell faded, as it was only the second time in cricket history when a team hit the last ball to win the final of a tournament
 isse pehle 1986 main javed miyandad ne sharajah main bharat ke khilaaf yah karnama kiya tha
 And now, after 32 years, that famous six of Miandad was faded

 29 runs in just 8 balls, Dinesh Karthik gave such a deposit: a day before Rangmatch, Karthik himself has accepted, 'I am in every situation, every tournament is necessary for me

 So it is important for me to be at the top of my game in every tournament and perform as best i can

 do saal, do maah or 10 dinon ke baad, antarrashtriya nyaayalay (isije) ne aakhirkaar bhartiya naagarik kulbhushan sudhir jadhav ke vivaadaaspad maamle par faisla suna diya
 Pakistan had arrested him in 2016 and sentenced him to death by accusing him of spying and spreading terrorism
 netherland ke hegg main great haul of justise se jab adhikari baahar nikal gaye to bharat ne pis pales ke praangan main jeet kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Indian delegation led by PAI (pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran), Joint Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs and ICJ agent Deepak Mittal for the case, was confident that India was in a strong position on issues of violation of international agreements
 'duutavas se sampark' ke maamalon main isije ke purv nirdhaarit niyamon kaa khulaa ulanghan hua tha or iske aadhaar par bharat 'majboot sthiti' main tha
 The two cases that India cited — lagrand (germany v
 America) and Avena (mexico v
 America) —the International Court of Justice decided in favor of those countries that requested compliance with international agreements including the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCRC) are also included
 haalanki isije ne apane adhikaar kshetra ko nahin laangha par bharat ke maamle kii nishpaksh sunwaayee ho gai
 The ICJ ruled in favor of India and the court came to the conclusion that Pakistan had violated Article 36 of the VCCR by not allowing Jadhav to contact the embassy
 faisle main kaha gaya he, ''pakistan ko kulbhushan sudhir jadhav ko unke adhikaron kii soochna bina kisi or deree ke deni hogi tathaa vienna kanvension ke anuchhed 36 ke anusaar bhartiya vaanijya duutavas adhikariyon ko un tak pahunchane kii suvidha deni hogi
 The icj's order to "review" the verdict and "reconsider" the punishment of punishment is a major victory for India, as the primary request from India was to provide impartial investigation and legal aid and access to the embassy
 lekin adaalat ne kaha ki pakistan ko jadhav par chalaae gaye mukademe kii prabhavi samiksha or use di gai sajaa par apane hisaab se punarvichaar kii vyavastha kerani hogi
 This is the aspect of the ICJ decision on which Pakistan is claiming its victory as it has not been asked to release Jadhav and has the right to decide as he wishes
 court kii is tippanee kii pakistan kis prakaar vyakhya karata he, uske liye bharat ko intjaar karnaa padegaa lekin yah to tay he ki vah chaahe jo bhi rasta akhriyaar kare, duutavas ko jadhav se sampark kii suvidha deni hogi
 Pakistan was in the process of finding a different way to consider espionage cases, citing the 2008 bilateral agreement between India and Pakistan, but the court held that bilateral agreements between nations could not exceed large treaties
 isije nyaayadhish abdulkavi ahamed yusuf ne faisle main kaha ''vienna samjhaute kaa anuchhed 36 saaf kahata he ki naagarik jis bhi desh kaa ho, use us desh ke duutavas se sampark or samvaad kaa adhikaar he or jasusi ke maamle iske apwaad nahin hai
 The final and very important aspect of the verdict was the icj's decision on capital punishment
 isane ghoshnaa kii ki ''shri kulbhushan sudhir jadhav ke maamle kii jab tak prabhavi samiksha or punarvichaar kii prakriya puri nahin ho jaati tab unhen koi sajaa nahin di ja sakati

 There is news of relief for Prime Minister Theresa May after the debacle in Parliament over BREXIT
 vipaksh dwaara laae gaye avishvaas prastaav par hui voting main theresa me ko jeet mili he
 According to the BBC, 306 votes were cast in favor of the no-confidence motion of the opposition Labor Party, while 325 mps voted against
 is prakaar theresa me sarkaar par chhaae sankat ke badal chant gaye or unki sarkaar girane kaa khatra philhal tal gaya
 However, the status of what will happen next on his proposal to keep Britain out of the EU is not clear yet
 europea union se britain ko alag karne vaale pradhanmantri theresa me ke prastaav par mangalvaar ko sansad voting hui thi
 Theresa May had 202 votes in favor and 432 in opposition in the British Parliament, the House of Commons
 yahaan tak ki unki apni conservative party ke 118 saansadon ne bhi unke prastaav ko khaarij kar diya tha
 After this, the opposition Labor Party brought a no-confidence motion against the government in Theresa, which was voted late Wednesday night at Indian time
 is voting main theresa me ke samarthan main 325 saansad khadey najar aae or unhone avishvaas prastaav ke khilaaf voting kii, jabaki 306 saansadon ne vipaksh ke avishvaas prastaav kaa samarthan kiya
 In this way, Theresa won and the crisis of her government's fall is averted
 1973 se europea union main britainbritain ne 1973 main 28 sadasyeey europea sangh kii sadsyta hasil kii thi
 He has to break away from this union on 29 March
 ise lekar hi theresa me ne ek samjhauta pesh kiya tha
 He faced opposition from his party's mps, including opposition Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, over the deal
 unke prastaav par jab sansad main voting hui to unhen itihaas kii sabase buree haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 His motion in the House of Commons fell to 432 votes against 202
 yani 230 vot kaa yah antar aadhunik itihaas main kisi bhi british piem kii sabase karaari haar he
 Opposition calls the settlement Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Conservative Opposition Labor Party, also commented on his proposal, calling Theresa May's defeat disastrous
 corbine ke theresa ke prastaav ko adhakachara or nuksaan pahunchane vaala bataate hue kaha ki yah samjhauta britain ke liye andhere main andhi chalaang lagane jaisaa hoga
 Within minutes of Theresa's defeat, Jeremy Corbyn announced a no-confidence motion against Theresa in Theresa
 jiske baad puri duniya main yah charchaa hone lagi ki theresa me kii sarkaar ab khatre main he
 All kinds of speculations started
 lekin agle hi din jab is avishvaas prastaav par voting hui to jeremi corbin apane uddeshy main vifal ho gaye or 325 saansadon ne theresa me kaa samarthan kiya
 Now it is to see what solution can be found on Breguit
 kyonki niyamon ke mutabik, jab saansad koi vidheyak khaarij kar dete hai, to pradhanmantri ke paas duusari yojana ke saath sansad main aane ke liye teen kaamkaaji din hote hai
 That is, after recovering from the crisis of no-confidence motion, Theresa May has a challenge to bring an agreement on Breguit on which the whole parliament can agree and clear Britain's way out of the European Union

 28 disambar ko vipaksh ke bharat band bulaane par nakvi bole ki aakrosh diwas kiske liye he kaale dhan ke kuber rakhane waalon ke liye he
 After the opposition there is nothing to say, so the Parliament is not allowed to run by rhyme
 piem ke sadan main aane par mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki piem sadan main aae bhi he or aage bhi aaenge or charchaa main bhaag bhi lenge par ye log sadan nahin chalane de rahe
 In this way, on the statement made by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Parliament, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said that such words were not expected by Manmohan Singh, so we will not say anything on this
 kaledhan ko lekar jo faisla hamanen liya he vah isi tarah hi liya ja saktaa tha jisase kisi ko bhi kaala dhan rakhane ke liye samay naa mili
 Jitendra Singh said that the PM has rightly said that those who are opposing it are doing this because they did not get time to hide the money
 bainkon main dhire-dhire kataren kam ho rahi he, jald hi line laganaa band ho jayega
 Significantly, the opposition is creating a ruckus in the Parliament regarding demonetisation and the issue of the absence of the Prime Minister from the House is constantly being raised
 sharad pavaar-ajit pavaar, bal thakare-raaj thakare, gopnith munde-dhananjay munde, ye is baat ke udhaaharan hai ki maharashtra main raajnneetik pariwaron main chachaa-bhattije kii ladaai koi nai nahin he
 The present case is related to the Pawar family where the political developments in Maharashtra have taken a new turn due to the uncle-nephew battle
 iske chalate rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) main kaaphi bechaini he
 Before NCP in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena and BJP have also lost two to four in the battle of uncle-nephew
 beete shanivaar ko ajit pavaar party sangrakshak evam apane chachaa sharad pavaar ke viruddh chale gaye or bhaajapa ke saath milakar rajya ke upmukhyamantri pad kii shapath grahan kar lee
 Their revolt and decision to support the BJP not only shook the NCP, but also shook the family closely connected to each other
 apane bhai anant raav kii maut ke baad sharad pavaar ne unke bete ajit pavaar ko apane sangrakshan main le liya tha
 Ajit Pawar contested the parliamentary election from Baramati for the first time in 1991 and won
 sharad pavaar jab 1991 main pivi narsingh raav sarkaar main raksha mantri bane to ajit ne yah seat unhen de di
 This was just the beginning
 saat baar vidhayak or purv main upmukhyamantri rahe ajit pavaar rakanpa pramukh ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke rup main dekhe jane lage, lekin tanaav tab shuru hua jab sharad pavaar kii beti supriya sule ne raajnneeti main pravesh kiya
 a similar dispute arose in the Thackeray family nearly a decade ago
 uddhav thakare or raaj thakare ke bich vivaad ke chalate antat: shivasena do faad ho gai
 Bal Thackeray paid more attention to his son Uddhav than his nephew and Raj Thackeray formed a new party
 pavaar or thakare parivaar kii tarah munde parivaar main bhi vivaad hua
 In 2009, when OBC leader Gopinath Munde emerged victorious from Beed, most people thought that he would field his nephew Dhananjay Munde in the assembly elections, but instead fielded his daughter Pankaja Munde from Parli seat
 isse chachaa-bhattije ke bich manabhed or gaharaa gaya tathaa dhananjay munde rakanpa main shaamil ho gaye
 Later he became Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council
 gopinath munde ke nidhan ke baad paariwarik pratidwandvita akasar surkhiyon main aati rahi
 In 2014 Pankaja Munde defeated her cousin from Parli
 vahiin, 2019 main dhananjay mude ne baaji palatate hue apni chacheri bahan pankaja ko haraa diya
 There are more such examples in Maharashtra
 pichley maheene hue vidhansabha chunaav main shivasena ke jaidatt kshirsagar ko unke bhattije evam rakanpa ummidavaar sandip kshirsagar ne bid seat se haraa diya

 Similarly, his upcoming film 'pati Patni Aur Woh' will also feature a love triangle between Kartik Aaryan, Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Pandey
 mahendra singh dhoni par bani film 'dhoni: da antold story' cricket phens ko bahut pasand aa rahi he
 But for a scene in the film, Dhoni's old partner and former India player Mohammad Kaif had to give his cleaning
 tippaniyan In the film, when Dhoni hits the ground against Bangladesh in his first ODI match, Kaif is batting at the other end
 dhoni pehali hi gend par ran lene kii koshish karte hai magar bina khaataa khole hi ranout ho jate hai
 a friend of his watching the match on TV says "kaif was a mistake"
 kaiff ne twit par safaai dete hue kaha ki " nahin bhai, meri koi galati nahin thi
 " kaiff ne dhoni ke saath apni pehali mulaakaat ko yaad karte hue kaha he ki " maine pehali baar emes dhoni ko devdhar trophy main dekha tha
 i was the captain of the Central Zone, and Dhoni hit 84 runs while playing for the East Zone and we lost the match
 " dhoni kii film kii taareef karte hue kaiff ne kaha ki ye ek shandaar film he or bataati he ki yuvaaon ko hameshaa apane sapane puure kerani kii har koshish kerani chahie

 Kaif recalls his first meeting with Dhoni, stating that “I first saw MS Dhoni at the Deodhar Trophy
 main central zone kaa captain tha, or dhoni ne east zone ke liye khelte hue tabadatod 84 ran maare or ham match haar gaye
 "praising Dhoni's film, Kaif said that it is a fantastic film and shows that the youth should always make every effort to fulfill their dreams
" england ko paanch test maichon kii siries main 4-0 se haraane vaali team india ko is baar board se inami raashi nahin milegi
 The board always gives a prize money to the senior or under-19 team for doing well, but this time it will not be able to do so
 iske peeche kaaran supreme court kaa wo aadesh he, jisamen bisisiai kii vittiya swatantraaa or adhikaron ko simit kar diya he
 The Supreme Court has limited the powers of the richest board until it accepts the recommendations of the Lodha Committee
 bisisiai ko abhi kisi bhi raashi ke vitaran ke liye supreme court kii sweekruti kii jarurat he
 The senior team usually gets huge incentives
 team ne 2015 main jab chaar maichon kii siries main dakshin africa ko haraaya tha to use do karod rupee kii inami raashi mili thi
 In such a situation, Virat Sena, who won a historic 4–0 win over England, will have to wait a little longer for the incentive
 teen janvari ko hone vaali sunwaayee se pehle kuch nahin ho saktaa
 Earlier the court had allocated 58 lakh 66 thousand rupees for every Test match against England and appealed to release 25 lakh rupees for each limited overs match
 bhartiya cricket team england se paanch test maichon kii shrunkhlaa ganvaakar aae yaa drow karakar laute, vastav main isse bhartiya cricket ke bhavishya par kuch khaas fark nahin padane vaala
 After four years, we will again be playing another five-test series in England
 vastav main vishwa cricket main yah takat bharat ne apni apaar aarthik shakti ke bal par hasil kii he
 India has been playing five Test matches in England for the last 55 years and till now India have been losing all the series badly
 maujuuda siries main england ne manchester or old trofford main lagaataar do maichon main bharat ko buree tarah haraakar siries main ajey badhat hasil kar lee he
 If the team that visited England in 1952 or 1959 with a defensive attitude on the current tour would have won the Lord's Test too
 duusari ore england kii maujuuda team nischitator par 50 ke dashak kii team se kamjor maani jaaegi
 Despite this, they easily win two consecutive matches
 lords test se ek baat spasht ho chuki he ki bhartiya gendbaaj kisi bhi anya english gendbaaj kii tarah english vaataavaran main swing or oochaal praapt karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 But after the Lord's Test, suddenly all the batsmen were seen running away from their responsibilities
 bhartiya team ko maujuuda test main nishchit taur par do maichon ke bich dostana match khilne kaa mauka nahin mila, jisase ki ve apane atirikt khilaadiyon ko aank sakate
 In every series, only a few counters for India are seen performing well in private and something similar was seen in this series too
 haalanki bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni purv captainon kii bhaanti anargal bahaane banaate najar nahin aae
 The team, which has consistently performed poorly, is able to perform better and very few captains are able to carry and Dhoni could not be an exception
 duusari ore siries main 1-0 se pichhadane ke baad english captain elister cook ne yah karnama kar dikhaaya
 What is the importance of rehearsal in Test matches can be understood by looking at the Indian team
 lambey arse ke baad vaapasi karne vaale ballebaaj gautam gambhir indian premier lig (ipel) main jin shots par wicket ke peeche boundry paa rahe the, vahi shot yahaan unhen pavilion bhejne ke liye kaaphi rahe
 Perhaps calling Rohit Sharma more than Gambhir, who has not played in any international competition for two months, could have been beneficial for Dhoni
 bharat ke bhavishya ke captain ke taur par dekhe ja rahe viraat kohli or cheteshwar pujaara se kaaphi ummiden thim, lekin donon hi ballebaajon ne kaaphi niraash kiya
 The most surprising was that the Indian team, considered a master in playing spin, kneeled before a part time spin bowler like Moin Ali
 duusari ore bhartiya gendbaajon ne apni ballebaaji se visheshgy ballebaajon ko kadava sabak diya he
 Only Ajinkya Rahane has shown a bit of struggle
 khilaadiyon ke chayan sahit kai faislon ko lekar captain dhoni ke nirnyon par bhi sawaal uthe hai
 Despite all this, everything is not over for the Indian team, which can win the team at Lord's, while it can also win at The Oval
 bas jarurat he videshi dharti par beete pradarshan kaa dabaav apane dimag se nikaala jaae

 Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal was awarded the 'most Influential Person' at the World Brand Summit in Dubai on Friday
 iske baad unhone apane bijness class ke hawaii safar par safai di
 Putting his own and party's view on the definition of 'aam Aadmi', he said, 'aam Aadmi is not a poor man
 vah he jo is desh main ek eemaandaar vyavastha chahta he
 The special person is the one who is using today's unscrupulous system for his own benefit and who never wants this system to improve
 'vyangy karte hue unhone kaha, 'jaise hi maine yahaan land kiya, pataa chalaa ki hamaare desh main dibet chal rahaa he ki main bijness class main idhar aayaa
 i was not there, otherwise i would have told them that i was not sitting there without tickets
 ' unhone kaha ki hamaara bharat kaa sapana yahi he ki har aam aadmi bijness class main safar karne laayak bane
 Our dream is not to make all business class people sit on the train
 ham vikaas chaahate hai
 Significantly, Kejriwalbusiness class had reached Dubai by air
 is par vipakshi dalon ne kaaphi ho-hallaa machaaya
 However, the Aam Aadmi Party later made it clear that Kejriwal had received the business class ticket from the institution which honored him
 unhone kaha, 'main ek baar banaras se laut rahaa tha
 i went by train and came back by plane
 main iconmi class main tha
 It ran for 24 hours on the channels that it also goes in the plane
 main aam aadmi kii paribhaasha saaf karnaa chahta hum
 i said this in the Delhi Legislative Assembly too
 aam aadmi garib aadmi nahin he
 He is the one who wants an honest system in this country
 khaas aadmi vah he jo aaj ke beyimaan system ko apane phaayde ke liye istemaal kar rahaa he or jo kabhi nahin chahta ki yah system sudhare
 'kejriwal's words were,' a rich man living in Greater Kailash who wants to change the system can also be a common man
 or ek garib aadmi jo kisi bhi tarah se system kaa galat phayda uthaa rahaa he, vah bhi khaas aadmi he
 Therefore the common man is not a poor man, he is one who wants honest politics
 aapmen se bahut saare log hai, jinhone eemaandaaree se paisa kamaaya he
 There is nothing wrong in making money honestly
