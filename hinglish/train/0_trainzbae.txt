 Sachin Pilot is the President of Rajasthan Congress
 chunaav main congress ko jeet milane ke baad yuva netaa payalat ke mukhyamantri banane ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 Due to young face and good education, he remains the favorite leader of the people of the state
 gahalot khemaa bhi dam lagaae hue he
 It will now be decided by Rahul Gandhi in Delhi
 donon netaaon ke samarthak bhi dilli main shakti pradarshan kar rahe hai
 While the supporters of Gehlot are arguing for the veteran leader, the pro-pilot are adamant on demanding the young leader be given the command of Rajasthan
 sachin payalat 26 kii umr main hi saansad ban gaye the
 Minister in 31 years and State President of Congress in 33 years
 inhen khaas visheshtaon kii vajah se vah siem kii res main wo aage hai
 However, on whose name will be decided in Gehlot and Pilot, the pilot himself believes that no one can snatch what is written in luck, what cannot be written cannot be
 rajasthan main aage unhen kaisaa role milane vaala he, is bare main ve kabhi kah chuke hai ki bhavishya ke bare main ve nahin jaanate, lekin party ko us jagah tak jarur le aae hai, jahaan ham sarkaar banane kii sthiti main hai
 It is clear from this that pilots do aspire for the CM position somewhere
 choti- si umr main saarvajanik jivan main khub naam kamaane vaale sachin payalat abhi pradesh ke diggaj netaaon main se ek hai
 Sachin, son of Rajesh Pilot, a veteran Congress leader and close to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, did his early studies in Delhi and then in the US
 unki shuruaati shiksha nai dilli ke airforce bal bharti skool main hui
 After this, he studied college from Delhi itself
 unhone bie onors (english) kii degree dilli vishvavidhyalay ke saint steffens college se kii
 Pilot then moved to the United States for an MBA, where he studied at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the top universities in the world
 jab sachin padhai kar rahe the usee dauraan ek sadak haadase main unke pita rajesh payalat kii maut ho gai thi
 He also worked two and a half years at a multinational company in Gurgaon (now Gurugram) after completing his studies at St

 Pilot and Sara already had a family relationship
 prem ke dauraan in donon ne ek-duusare ko samajha or phir 2004 main shaadi kar lee
 Pilot is also the father of two sons
 sabase badi baat yah he ki 26 saal kii umr main saansad banakar payalat ne bharat ke sabase yuva saansad hone kaa tamgaa hasil kar liya tha
 From 2004 to 2008, he watched and understood politics with intelligence
 yah daur unke liye golden phej ban kar aayaa kyonki 2008 main congress jab lagaataar duusari baar centre main sarkaar banaai to unhen mantrimandal main sanchaar evam soochna praudyogiki mantri bana diya gaya
 Presently, he is the Congress President and newly elected MLA in Rajasthan

 Many many happy returns sweetheart May god bless you always @ritssajdeha photo posted by @rohitsharma45 on Dec 20, 2015 at 8:00pm PST Wedding and reception took place on 13 December ramajaan islamic calendar kaa nauvaan maheenaa hota he
 This year, the holy month of Ramadan has started from 7 May 2019
 ramajaan ko 'kuran kaa maheenaa' bhi kaha jaataa he, kyonki isi maheene main paigambar mohammad ke jariye kuran utaara gaya tha
 In Ramadan, giving Zakat and Fitra (charity or charity) along with Rosa-namaz and Tilawat of Quran (reciting Quran) is also very important
 jakaat islam ke 5 stambhon main se ek he
 According to Islam, a Muslim who also has so much money or property that he is meeting his own expenses and is in a position to help someone, then he becomes eligible to donate
 ramajaan main is daan ko do rup main diya jaataa he, fitra or jakaat
 Let's know what is fitra and zakat
 kya he jakaat (daan)islam main ramajaan ke paak maheene main har haisiyatmand musalmaan par jakaat dena jaruri bataaya gaya he
 2 of the savings in the whole year from income
 5 fisadi hissaa kisi garib yaa jaruratmand ko diya jaataa he, jise jakaat kehete hai
 That is, if a Muslim has 100 rupees left after spending all, then 2 of that
 5 rupee kisi garib ko dena jaruri hota he
 Though zakat can be given at any time throughout the year, but like filing returns after the end of the financial year, most people take out zakat in the whole month of Ramadan
 musalmaan is maheene main apni puure saal kii kamai kaa akalan karte hai or usamen se 2
 5 percent donate
 asal main id se pehle yani ramajaan main jakaat adaa karne kii parampara he
 This zakat is specially given to the poor, widowed women, orphan children or any sick and weak person
 mahilaon yaa purushon ke paas agar jewelery ke rup main bhi koi sampatti hoti he to uski keemat ke hisaab se bhi jakaat di jaati he
 But those who, despite being fortunate, do not give zakat in the Raza of Allah, it is one of the guilty
 kise deni hoti he jakahogar parivaar main paanch sadsy hai or wo sabhi naukari yaa kisi bhi jariye paisa kamaate hai to parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon par jakaat dena ferj mana jaataa he
 For example, if a son or daughter also earn money through a job or business, then only their parents cannot avoid paying zakat on their earnings, but it is also obliged to pay zakat on the earning son or daughter
 jakaat ke bare main paigambar mohammad ne farmaaya he, 'jo log ramajaan ke maheene main jakaat nahin dete hai, unke roje or ibaadat kubul nahin hoti he, balki dharti or jananath (heaven) ke bich main hi ruuk jaati he
 'what is Fitrafitara is the amount that people from the eating and drinking, resourceful houses give to the economically weaker people
 id kii namaaj se pehle iskaa adaa karnaa jaruri hota he
 In this way, Eid is also considered rich, rich as well as poor
 fitre kii rakam bhi garibon, bevaaon va yateemon or sabhi jaruratmandon ko di jaati he
 The thinking behind all this is that there should be no empty hands on the day of Eid, because it is a day of happiness
 jakaat or fitre main bada fark ye he ki jakaat dena roje rakhane or namaaj padhane jaisaa hi jaruri hota he, balki fitra dena islam ke tahat jaruri nahin he
 Regarding Fitre, Islamic scholar Maulana Abdul Hameen Nomani told that 2 in Zakat
 5 fisadi dena tay hota he jabaki fitre kii koi seemaa nahin hoti
 Human beings can give any amount according to their status
 vahiin, jakaat va fitra par roshni daalate hue vishwa vikhyath islamic santhaan darul ulum devband ke jansampark adhikari ashraf osmani sahab ne bataaya, 'allaah taala ne id kaa tyohaar garib or amir sabhi ke liye banaaya he
 Poverty does not decrease the happiness of the people, so Allah Ta'ala has obliged Zakat and Fitr on every rich Muslim

 '' There is a legend in Indian Manisha that once Lord Shiva brought Goddess Ganga to Gujarat, and this led to the birth of Sabarmati River
 kuch sadi pehle iskaa naam bhogava tha
 If the name of Bhogwa was changed, then new names were also associated with it
 gujarat kii vanijyik or raajnneetik rajdhaniyaan; ahmedabad or gandhinagar sabarmati nadi ke tat par hi basaae gaye the
 There is also a legend that Sultan Ahmed Shah of Gujarat Sultanate once saw a rabbit chasing a dog while resting on the banks of Sabarmati
 us khargosh ke saahas se prerit hokar hi 1411 main shah ne ahmedabad kii sthapana kii thi
 Later, in the last century, the Sabarmati River became a sacred pilgrimage for Gandhians and countrymen as Mahatma Gandhi established the Sabarmati Ashram on the banks of this river
 lekin pichley kuch dashakon main yah paridrishy bhi badal gaya he
 Sabarmati now comes in the news for other reasons
 pehali khabar to yahi ki sabarmati kaa peta suukh gaya he or ab is nadi main iskaa nahin, narmada kaa pani bahata he
 Secondly, the Gujarat government has built a riverfront on its banks
 or ab is nadi ke kinare antarrashtriya patang mahotsav se lekar na jane kitne aayojan hote hai
 Xi Jinping also swinged the swing here
 2017 main vidhansabha chunaav ke vakt yaheen riverfrant par modi ji si-plane se utre the
 However, if you have ever been to Ahmedabad, you must have gone to the riverfront looking beautiful
 kya pataa aapane nadi ke pani par gaur kiya yaa nahin
 Experts say that the water flowing into the Sabarmati is highly polluted
 is bare main enjio paryaavaran suraksha samiti or gujarat pradooshan niyantran board (jipisibi) ne ek sanyukt adhyayan kiya he apane adhyayan main sabarmati main girane vaale udyogon se girane vaale apshisht or sivej treetment plant (astipi) se girane vaale pani se jude tathy khangale
 The report named Disastrous Condition of Sabarmati River, which came out earlier this year, has hidden many dangerous messages
 report kahati he ki ahmedabad ke vasana bairaj ke aage bane sivej treetment planthat jisaki kshamta 160 million litre rojaanaa (emeldi) usamen se girane vaale pani main baio chemical oxigen demand (biodi) kii maatra 139 migra prati litre he
 The Chemical Oxy Mass Demand (COD) is 337 mg per liter and the amount of total dissolved solids (TDS) is 732 mg per liter
 vaise rashtriya harith praadhikaran (engiti) kaa maanak pani biodi kii maatra adhiktam 10 migra prati litre tak kii he
 By the way, the quantity of sulfate in the water of the river has been stated to be 108 mg per liter and the quantity of chloride is 186 mg per liter
 isi tarah vasana bairaj ke aage nadi main industry ke girane vaale pani kii jaanch gai to saamne aayaa ki isamen baio chemical oxigen demand (biodi) kii maatra 536 migra prati litre he
 The amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD) has been found to be 1301 mg per liter, total dissolved solids (TDS) is 3135 mg per liter
 sulphetat kii maatra 933 migra prati litre he, vahiin closeraide kii maatra 933 migra prati litre he
 The special thing is that there is no account of how much water is being lost in the chemical equipment of the industry
 haalanki, sabarmati main apshisht jal ke treetment ke liye astipi banaae gaye hai par isse ek alag hi samasya khadi ho rahi he
 a study is also suggesting that disease-causing microorganisms develop resistance to antibiotics during treatment in these stps
 jaahir he, isse ek badi samasya khadi hone vaali he
 Manish Kumar, professor of earth sciences at IIT Gandhinagar, in a report on the website Down to Earth, which writes on the environment, says that we have found that multi-drug anti-microbial resistance has developed in E
 coli bacteria in sewage and reservoirs due to pollution
 has occurred
 jo ise sambhavatya superbag main badal degi
 What will be the effect of converting e coli into superbugs? Although most breeds of E
 coli are not responsible for diseases, many of them can cause diarrhea, pneumonia, bladder infections, colitis, and meningitis in newborns
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki yah kaam sivej treetment main chlorineshan or ultra-vilet radiation ke dauraan bacteria ke jin main utparivartan (muteshan) se hua hoga
 The problem is that if this gene transfer from bacteria does not give rise to a different and completely new species
 yah khatarnaak hoga
 However, these related biological bombs which are in the womb of the Sabarmati River are unnoticed
 bhagwaan shiv or ganga kii dein yah nadi ab narmada se pani udhaar lekar bah rahi he
 Media reports indicate that the water in Sabarmati is being fed through a canal
 riverfrant jahaan khatm hota he vahaan vasana bairaj he, jiske sabhi phatak band karke pani ko roka gaya he
 In such a situation, there is no water in the river ahead of the riverfront and after that there is no water in the river
 vasana bairaj ke baad nadi main jo bhi bah rahaa he wo industry or naale kaa kachra he
 The waste falling in the river is very dangerous and it will do harm to the people using this water
 ek report ke mutabik, ahmedabad ke baad agle 120 kimi tak nadi main sirf audyogic apshisht sade hue pani kii shakl main bahata he or yahi jaakar arab sagar main pravaahit hota he
 But how much water is left in the account of Narmada, which will be able to keep Sabarmati alive through this ad-hoc, it will also be a matter to be seen

 singh kaa na sirf tikat kataa balki unhen party se bhi nilambit kiya ja chukaa he
 a few days ago, Singh openly praised BJP leader Narendra Modi and gave the party a chance to get rid of him, as it had not been a long-standing relationship between him and the party

 haal ke samay main desh main college or vishvavidhyalay campus aksar apane shaikshanik daayaron se baahar kii gatividhiyon ke liye charchaa main rahe hai
 Conflicts of ideas and ideologies have taken violent forms in many campuses
 lekin yah shaayad rajnatik takat kaa santulan ek taraf jhukne kii ek swaabhaavik-si prakriya he
 But this change has not affected the pursuit of academic excellence
 desh ke sarvshereshth collejon ke bare main india today group ke is saal ke surveykshan ke nattejey is baat ke gavaah hai
 It is clear that excellence becomes a part of nature, with many institutions permanently occupying the top ten list of all subjects
 haa, beshak isamen kuch halke-phulke badlaav to aate hi rahete hai
 For example, the Lady Shri Ram College of Women in Delhi has regained its supremacy in subjects related to humanities
 pratishthit sangh lok seva ayog kii pariksha main haal ke safal ummidavaaron main awwal sthaan hasil karne vaale is college ke paas jashn manaane kii ek or vajah bhi he
 It also tops colleges offering bachelor's (b
ed
) degrees in education
 is survey main yah course pehali baar shaamil kiya gaya he
 Another story of success that has emerged in the last three years is the continuous upward movement of Christ University of Bangalore and Hansraj College in Delhi
 bangaluru ke is dimd nijee vishvavidhyalay ne snaatak kii teen shaikshanik dhaaraon- kala, vigyaan or commers, teenon main teesraa sthaan hasil kiya he
 Apart from this, he has been ranked number one in the BBA and BCA courses
 vahiin hansraj college, jahaan se kabhi bollywood superstar shahrukh khan padhai kar chuke hai, vigyaan main paanchaven or arts main chathe sthaan par rahaa he
 In both, he has jumped from ninth place of last year
 commers main bhi usne ek paaydaan upar chadhakar is saal suchi main paanchvaan sthaan hasil kiya he
 Excluding these different stories, the main screenplay of the survey has been almost the same
 survey main vibhinn shaikshanik dhaaraon main sammanjanak sthaan hasil karne vaale zyaadaatar college chaar mahanagaron ke bheetar simate hue hai
 However, it also reveals a worrying and dangerous sign of non-equalization of higher education in the country
 sabase chintajanak nishkarsh to yah he ki purvi bharat ke sabase bade shahar kolkata kaa ek bhi college desh main arts ke sheersh 50 collejon main shumaar nahin sakaa
 Although three of its colleges have managed to make it to the top 50 in science and commerce streams, any college in three other big cities of eastern India - Guwahati, Bhubaneshwar and Patna make it to the top 50 in any of the three main streams
 i have not been able to succeed
 chaar mahanagaron main bhi zyaadaatar dhaaraon main dilli hi awwal he
 The National Capital Institute tops the seven streams - Arts, Science, Commerce, Medicine, Fashion, bed and Hotel Management
 arts, science or commers ke top 50 collejon main se kramshah 15, 13 or 10 dilli main hai
 The 2014-15 All India Survey Report on Higher Education says that there are only 188 colleges in Delhi, i
e
 only nine per one lakh population in the age group of 18-23, which is far below the national average of 27
 isse daakhila chaahane waalon ke bich har saal pravesh ke liye hone vaali galakat pratispardhaa kii vajah spasht ho jaati he
 That is why there is no chance of getting rid of this year from the cut-off list that has skyrocketed from year to year
 padosi rajya uttar pradesh main sthiti thik ulat he
 This vast state has the highest, 5,922 colleges in the country
 iske baavjood kala, vigyaan va commers main sheersh 50 collejon main rajya ke sirf teen collejon ko sthaan mil paaya he
 However, this ratio is slightly better in terms of technical education, where four engineering colleges, three medical colleges and two law colleges have been ranked in the top 25

 youtube par sabsakribar ke maamle main number-1 banane kii res main do youtube channel shaamil hai
 For some months, both these channels are fiercely competing
 ek taraf he bharat kii diggaj mujeec company t-series to duusari taraf he sweden ke ek video blogar kaa utyub channel pewdiepie
 Talking about the latest subscriber base, pewdiepie currently has 71,939,650 subscribers, while the t-series has 71,736,543 subscribers
 yani duniya kaa number-1 youtube channel ab tak pewdiepie he, lekin ummid kii ja rahi he ki t-series isse aage nikal jayega or number-1 utyub channel banegaa
 The difference of the subscriber in these two is just a difference of 2 lakhs
 ye to hui sabsakribers kii baat, lekin aisa nahin he ki ye sirfutubaper he
 In real life, fans from both sides are fighting a kind of digital war to remain at number-1
 posters lagaae ja rahe hai, promoshan kiye ja rahe hai, ek duusare ko gaaliyaan tak di ja rahi hai
 Mims are full of social media
 pewdiepie kai saal se laagaatar duniya kaa number -1 utyub channel he
 But now Indian music channel is growing fast to hold T-series number-1 and in such a situation people on social media have made it a battle for India and other country
 log t-series ke channel ko number-1 banane ke liye lagaataar soshal media par promoshan kar rahe hai
 Talking about pewdiepie, ad campaigning is being done for this channel so that it remains number-1
 puure shahar ko pewdiepie vigyaapan se bhar diya gaya he
 Television, radio, and billboards are being spent heavily on advertising everywhere
 logon se ise sabsakrib karne ko kaha ja rahaa he or iskaa phayda pewdiepie ko mila or teji se sabsakribar bade
 Indian users who have watched the pewdiepie channel are angry
 isaki vajah ye he ki wo apane video main bharat kii kaaphi buraai karte hai
 Perhaps this could also be the reason that the Indian music company is ready to snatch the crown of No
 1
 dilachasp ye he ki jin video main unhone bharat ko lekar bura bhala kaha he ki wo videos zyada hit hue hai, aise main ye bhi ek tathy he ki is chakkar main wo or bhi isi tarah kaa video bana rahe hai
 In terms of video views, the t-series has already overtaken pewdiepie
 kyonki t-series ke videos ko 53 billian times dekha gaya he, jabaki pewdiepie ke videos ke 19 billian vyuj hai

 Who will be the winner of Bigg Boss 11 is in full swing in the finale week
 ek naam jo pramukhataa se saamne aa rahaa he vah shilpa scindia kaa he
 Some of the arguments behind contesting him in front of contestants like Hina Khan or Vikas Gupta are interesting
 kahin na kahin ye shilpa kii jeet ke daawey kii ek sachai maane ja sakate hai
 Though the name of the winner will be announced by Sunday, but before that, we know the three reasons that can make Shilpa Shinde a winner
 # 1
 Shilpa Vs Others' Game When it was seen that Shilpa's claim is strong, the rest of the members of the house have started forming amongst themselves
 sabane shilpa ke khilaaf ekajute hokar morcha bana liya he
 However, before Finale Week, Salman had clearly told all the members to play alone for themselves at the last moment of the show
 lekin shilpa kii vajah se abhi bhi teen majboot daavedaar ek hokar khel rahe hai
 Vikas even said in a conversation with Hina and Akash that Shilpa is not to be given any chance that she will cry and take sympathy
 shilpa ke khilaaf vikaas or dusron kaa yah pintara 'bhaabi ji' ko phayda pahunchane vaala sabit ho saktaa he
 Shilpa still playing alone is most beneficial for her
 Bigg Boss 11: salmaan ne shilpa ko di chetavanee, thande pade 'bhabhi ji' ke tevar # 2
 All the contestants also believed that Shilpa is at the forefront of the house or everyone is aware that Shilpa deserves to win the Big Boss
 is baat ko big bos se baahar kai seleb bhi maanate hai
 In Weekend Ka Vaar, Salman got a ranking from the family
 isamen sabhi ne mana ki ab tak shilpa ghar main sabase aage hai
 Punish is continuously claiming Shilpa's victory
 big bos ke ghar se baahar bhi lagbhag aisa hi maahaul he
 Shilpa Shinde, who has got good support in all the voting, recently got the most votes in comparison to other contestants in the voting in Mall of Mumbai

 lekin sawaal yahi he kimanoj tiwariko der raat kor cameti kii baithak bulaane kii zarurat kyon padi
 Is it not so that after trying to sidestep, Manoj Tiwari wants to tell more that the boss of the party in Delhi is now the same and his will be done in the party

 driver kii ore se ride cancel ho to graahak ko di jaae penalty'sarj prising par puure desh main adhik se adhik 25% kaa cap lage'rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) ke aarthik prakoshth swadeshi jaagran manch (SJM) ne kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ko chitthee likh kar taxi agrigaters kii ore se sarj prising ke naam par kii jane vaali manamaani par roak lagane kii maang kii he
 SJM has said in the letter that 25% cap should be imposed on the surges pricing
 aisa karne se peak owers ke naam par taxi agrigaters ko manamaana kiraaya vasuulne se roka ja sakegaa
 It has also been demanded in the letter that if the ride is canceled by the taxi app company, then the company should be punished
 SJM ne hairaani jataai he ki agar graahak kii ore se ride cancel kii jaati he to usase ap aadhaarit taxi agrigater penlti vasuul karata he lekin khud yaa driver kii ore se ride cancel hone par graahak ko koi kshatipurti nahin kii jaati
 SJM national co-convenor Dr Ashwini Mahajan told India Today, 'the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (morth) is in the process of framing rules for app based taxi aggregators under the Motor Vehicle Act 2019, so we have requested the minister That the rules should be made keeping in mind the interests of the people
 ’dow mahajan ne saath hi mantralay ko chetaya ki agar janhit dhyaan main nahin rakhaa gaya to logon main naaraazgi hogi or rajya taxi agrigaters ke liye khud ke alag niyamon ke saath saamne aa sakate hai
 In a letter to the Road Transport Minister, the SJM has raised four main demands - 1- Surge pricing should impose a cap of at least 25% across the country
 2- taxi ap yaa driver kii ore se ride cancel kii jaae to 100 rupye yaa kiraye kaa 20% graahak ke khate main credit kiye jaaen
 3- App based taxi aggregators should not be allowed surge pricing at the time of advance or scheduled booking
 4- custom sarvice or ap fitures ko is tarah unnat kiya jaae ki immergency yaa zarurat padane par customer sarvice centre se aasaani se baat kii ja sake
 Dr
 mahajan ne india today ko bataaya, ye dekha gaya he ki ubar or ola jaise taxi agrigaters jinhone 2014-15 main kam kiraye or suvidhajanak taxi sarvice ke naam par kaam shuru kiya tha, unhone ab sarj priceing ke naam munaafkhori shuru kar di he
 In the last two weeks, we have received such screen shots which showed a fare of Rs 2000 for a mere 6 minute ride in Mumbai, this is heartless and profiteering of these platforms
 mantralay ko likhi chitthee main dow mahajan ne kaha ki sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantralay agrigaters ke liye niyam banane kii prakriya main he
 Media reports said that the ministry is considering to allow up to three times the normal fare in the surges
 aisa hi mantralay kii ore se disambar 2016 main jari dishanirdeshon main bhi kaha gaya
 In such a situation, we urge that the public interest should be kept in mind while framing rules for taxi aggregators under the Motor Vehicle Act 2019

 When India host England in the upcoming ODI series, two balls will be used instead of one in each innings as new ICC rules will come into effect from 1 October
 isisi ke kaaryakari board ne may main landan main apni baithak ke dauraan isisi kii cricket samiti ke sanshodhan ke in prastaavon ko sweekruti di thi
 The five-match series between India and England will begin in Hyderabad from October 14
 prayek pari main do gendon ke istemaal ke niyam keval ekadivasiy antarrashtriya maichon main lagu honge
 New rules will also be introduced in all three formats of the game regarding obstructing the field (deadlock in fielding)
 niyam ke tahat, kshetrarakshan team kii apil par, agar ampire ko lagata he ki ballebaaj ran lete hue bina kisi kaaran ke apni disha main bada badlaav karata he to is tarah kshetrarakshan ke use ran out karne ke prayaas main baadha utpann karata he or ballebaaj ko kshetrarakshan main baadha pahunchane ke liye out diya janaa chahie
 It does not matter whether he was run out or not
 isisi ne kaha, ‘yah bhi sambhav he ki ballebaaj ko aise halaat main kshetrarakshan main baadha ke liye out diya jaye jabaki daudane ke dauraan usne apni disha main kaaphi antar nahin kiya, basharte ampire ko spasht ho ki ballebaaj ne kisi or tarah se kshetrarakshan main gatirodh utpann karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The on-field umpire may take the help of the third umpire to take this decision, but the final decision will be taken by the on-field umpire and tell the batsman
 iske alaava 50 over ke praaroop main powerple se judaa nayaa niyam bhi prabhavi hoga
 Under the new rule, the total number of power play overs will be 20 in each innings
 power play ke pehle das overon ke saath pari kii shuruyaat anivaary hogi jabaki doosraa or teesraa powerple 16 over se pehle nahin liya ja sakegaa or ise 40 over tak khatm karnaa hoga
 According to the ICC, 'this restriction will not be applicable in the innings of less than 40 overs
 iske alaava cricket ke kisi bhi praaroop main ballebaaj ko ranor nahin milegaa
 'the injured or sick batsman will have the option to come back later after getting retired
 nau wicket girane kii sthiti main yah vikalp nahin ho saktaa
 The ICC has also issued new rules for the batsman standing at the bowling end to be run out during bowling
 is niyam ke tahat gendbaaj ko running par khadey ballebaaj ko ran out karne kaa prayaas karne kii sweekruti hogi basharte usne gend nahin phenki ho or apana saamaanya gendbaaji ection bhi puraa nahin kiya ho
 Whether this effort is successful or not, the ball be counted
 agar gendbaaj kaa prayaas vifal rahata he to ampire ko ise jald se jald ‘ded bal’ kahana chahie
 Now if any captain urges the umpires to play an extra 15 minutes (minimum four overs) before lunch or tea break, then they can decide on it but only if they feel that this season will definitely result Will go
 agar ampiron ko lagata he ki nateeja hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa to atirikt samay nahin diya jayega
 Under another rule, if nine wickets have fallen by the regular time of lunch and tea, the resting time can be avoided for a maximum of half an hour
 bina kisi baadha vaale ekadivasiy match main pari ke bich ke antaraal ko 20 minute se badhaakar 30 minute kar diya gaya he
 At the same time, many people are also raising the question that when the fasting time was scheduled from 10 o'clock, why did Congress President Rahul Gandhi reach Rajghat around quarter to one o'clock
 kul milakar congress kaa ye deshvyapee upwas ab vivaadon main ghirta najar aa rahaa he
 Earlier, before Rahul's arrival in Rajghat itself, there was a ruckus when Congress leaders Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar reached the stage
 gauratlab he ki aaj congress daliton par atyaachaar, sansad na chalane dene or sampradayik sauhaard ke mudde par puure desh main anshan kar rahi he
 The guidelines sent by Ashok Gehlot to all party state presidents, AICC general secretaries / in-charge and legislative party leaders said that fasting on April 9 at Congress headquarters in all states and districts to protect and enhance communal harmony Be kept
 vahiin beete shuukravaar ko bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak main faisla liya gaya ki bijepi saansadon se kaha ki ve congress kii vibhedakaari nitiyon ke khilaaf 12 tarikh ko upwas rakhen
 The BJP is blaming the opposition for the kind of violence that took place in the case of Dalits and the violence that took place during the Bharat Bandh
 jaahir he congress or bijepi donon upwas ke zarie apane apane tareeqe se daliton ke haq main khadaa dikhne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Significantly, today the Congress is fasting across the country on the issue of atrocities on Dalits, not allowing Parliament to run, and communal harmony
 ashok gahalot kii taraf se party ke sabhi pradesh adhyakshon, eisisi mahasachivon / prabhariyon or vidhayak dal ke netaaon ke bheje gaye disha nirdesh main kaha gaya he ki sampradayik sauhaard ko bachaane or badhaane ke liye sabhi rajyon or jilon ke congress mukhyalayon main 9 april ko upwas rakhaa jaae
 At the meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party on Friday, it was decided to ask the BJP mps to fast on the 12th against the discriminatory policies of the Congress
 daliton ke maamle main jis tarah ke tool pakadaa or bharat band ke dauraan jo hinsa hui uske peeche bijepi vipaksh ko zimmedaar tehra rahi he
 It is clear that both the Congress and the BJP are trying to stand up for the Dalits in their own way through fasting

 The party and its leaders are unable to understand how they should play the role of a responsible political party in front of the country in this state of depression

 desh ke ek pratishthit vishvavidhyalay main desh virdohi naare lagen or aatankwaadiyon kii khuli himaayat ho, ise koi bhi naagarik sweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 But the statements made by the Congress Vice President and other leaders of his party going to JNU have proved once again that there is no place of national interest in their thinking

 satta par kabiz teenon rajyon main bhaajapa kii haar kii ek ahm vajah sattavirohi rujhaanon kii dotarafa maar rahi
 In order to cut the resentment against the state governments, the BJP placed a bet on Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lekin modi apni lokapriyata ke saath hi centre sarkaar ke khilaaf saadhe chaar saal main jamaa hue sattavirohi rujhaan ke boj ke saath chunaav maidan main utre jiskaa phayda congress ko mil gaya
 a senior BJP leader says that in the states where elections were held after 2014, the BJP performed well
 bihar or dilli iske apwaad hai or kerala, pudducheri, punjab or tamilnadu main bhaajapa kii upasthiti khaas nahin rahi he
 Even in the middle of this year, the BJP emerged as the largest party in Karnataka elections but after the elections JDS and Congress together formed the government and stopped the BJP
 lekin karnataka kii janata ne janadesh modi or bhaajapa ke samarthan main diya gaya tha
 After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP continued to win election-by-election
 isaki ek ahm vajah yah rahi he ki modi kii lokapriyata ke sahare bhaajapa ne satta main baithe apane virdohi dalon ko chunaav main ukhaad phenkaa
 Modi's image of a strong leader, Amit Shah's efficient election management and anti-incumbency against the opposition parties in power, dictated the bjp's victory
 lekin jab bhaajapa un rajyon main chunaav maidan main utari jahaan khud party sarkaar main thi to vahaan virodh main jo party thi vah satta main nahin thi
 So there was a problem in defending his government
 iskaa saaf sanket gujarat chunaav main mila
 The BJP successfully managed to save its government here and for the first time was forced to come to power with double figures
 madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main bhaajapa khud satta main thi
 Five years in Rajasthan and 15 years in both other states
 in donon rajyon main satta virdohi rujhaan ko paatane ke liye sthaneey netritv puri koshish kar rahaa tha lekin chunaav main jab bhaajapa netaaon ne centre sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa zikr bade paimaane par karnaa shuru kar diya to phir centre sarkaar ke khilaaf jamaa hue satta virdohi rujhaan rajya sarkaron ke khilaaf ekatra sattavirohi rujhaan main mil gaye or yah rujhaan nirnaayak sabit hua
 a former Madhya Pradesh government minister and BJP leader says that more than two-fold of the allegations leveled against the local government by the Congress in the elections were made against the central government
 rafel, notebandi, jiesti jaise mudde virdohi dalon kaa pramukh chunavi naaraa tha
 When the anti-incumbency trends of both the Center and the state are united, then it becomes very difficult to win
 hua yahi or teenon rajyon main bhaajapa jeet nahin pai
 With the emergence of the three states, the bjp's concern is not just here
 2019 ke liye bhi yah ek badi chunauti hogi
 Because there is a BJP government in the center and in most states there is a BJP government
 aise main centre sarkaar ke khilaaf jamaa hue satta virdohi rujhaan main jab rajyon ke satta virdohi rujhaan judenge to use paatna ek badi chunauti hogi
 If the BJP cannot find a solution to this problem, then the road to 2019 is difficult
 *** The Election Commission has asked social networking site Facebook to remove political advertisements 48 hours before voting in the country
 haalanki fasebuk ne ab tak is par koi pratikriya nahin di he, vah abhi is par vichaar kar rahaa he
 Significantly, after the name of Facebook surfaced in the Cambridge Analytica case and it affected the election in the US, efforts are being made to prevent misuse in social media elections across the world
 is sambandh main bhartiya chunaav ayog ne ek samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 Section-126 of the Representation of the People Act - 1951 was considered in the meeting of the committee on 4 June
 baithak memphasebukke pratinidhi ne is baat par sahmati jataai ki vah apane pej par ek windo yaa batan uplabdh karaane par vichaar karegaa jis par chunaav kanoonon ke ulanghan kii shikaayat kii ja sakegi
 The Facebook representative also agreed that the number of users reviewing content posted by it could be increased from the current 7,500
 chunaav ke samay is sankhya main parivartan kiya ja saktaa he
 Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act prohibits any kind of election campaign 48 hours before the vote so that the voter has time to decide
 fasebuk ke pratinidhi ne baithak main kaha ki contate ke khilaaf shikaayat fasebuk ke pej par hi kii ja sakati he or antarrashtriya maanakon ke anuroop isaki samiksha kii jaaegi
 If the content is found to be in violation of international standards it will be removed from the Facebook page
 vahiin yadi chunaav ayog yaa uske karmchaaree kisi content ko lekarniyamon ke ulanghanki shikaayat karte hai to is par teji se nirnay liya jayega
 (input language) yaad kiijie us pal ko, jab aapkaa saathi bahon main samaane ko utawala ho rahaa ho, par aapaki kisi choti-si baat se naaraaz hokar vah aapako tanaha tadapata chhodkar chalaa gaya ho
 Do your partner get upset over your small things many times, no matter how much he is in the first mood? If that is the case, it is your fault, not theirs
 jane-anjaane aksar ham aisi baaten kah jate hai, jinase partner ukhd jate hai
 Do not let this happen to you next time
 baaten kahen alag andaaj menapaka saathi agar samay kii kami ke chalate aapke saath date par nahin ja paata, to usase is baat kii shikaayat na karen
 Not complaining does not mean that you do not share your problems with them
 unhen man kii baat kahen jarur, lekin yah kehane kii bajaae ki unka aapke saath date par na janaa aapako acha nahin lagata, kahen ki agar vah aapke saath date par jaaengi, to yakeenan vah time unke liye behad khubasurat hoga
 Talk, never ask
 
 
 kabhi bhi apane saathi se yah sawaal na karen ki vah kisi gotra, dharm, yaa jati kaa he
 This can make them far away from you
 nazdikiyon ke palon main koi bhi in sawaalon ko sahajata se nahin le paaegaa
 Along with this, avoid asking or asking any other things
 jaise, kya aapako sangeet pasand he? ham kabhi pehle to nahin mili? main us tarah kaa ladkaa nahin hum, vagairah
 Women like men who talk without a hitch, so instead of covering themselves in a sheet of artificiality, stay in front of who you are
 bane jaraa chalabgar aap yah sochate hai ki apni saathi ke trouger yaa pant kii tarif karne se unhen yah ahsaas hoga ki aapke jahan main bistar ke khayalaat hai, to janaab aap bilkul galat soch rahe hai
 Appreciating the clothes, she will guess that you are in a shopping mood, so instead of praising the trousers, praise her body shape and say that the trouser is stuck on her feet
 sawaalon ko kahen alavidnagar vah aapke saath ko mahasoos kar rahi hai, to aap bhi unhen mahasoos karen
 Instead of asking stupid questions
 kabhi bhi bachakaane yaa vyaktigat baton ko kuredne vaale sawaal na karen, jaise agar vah talakshuda hai, to jaahir si baat he ki vah is mudde par katai baat karnaa nahin chahengi or aapke man main use lekar kai sawaal honge
 But suppress the questions of the mind within the mind, because on coming out, they can create a state of estrangement
 bhul jaaen puraani batenho saktaa he ki aapkaa bhi ek ateet rahaa ho
 Have you ever had a girlfriend before, but do not bring what has passed into your present
 kabhi bhi apane saathi kii puraani premika se tulana na karen
 You are very thin 
 
 kuch mahilaayein behad patali hoti hai
 It may be that you talk about it, but don't forget to say this to them that she looks very thin
 haa, aap agar apane man kii baat un tak pahunchaana chaahate hai, to kuch is dhang se kah sakate he, ‘aajkal zero sies kaa fishan apana rakhaa he aapane
 It fits on you, but believe me you will look better with some fat
 ’ mahilaon ko apane sharir par kiye gaye coment katai pasand nahin aate
 Especially when they are negative, so never underline their shortcomings
 haa, unki jo cheez aapako bhaae, uski tarif karne se na chuken
 On Tuesday, the Indian Air Force showed its valor and entered the border of Pakistan and destroyed the terrorist bases there, amid the demand for revenge from the whole country after the Pulwama terror attack
 vayusena ke is parakram ko jahaan puraa desh salaam kar rahaa he, vahiin ladaaku vimaan rafel bhi is bich charchaa ke centre main aa gaya he
 On the day of the air strike, where the Supreme Court accepted the reconsideration petition filed on Rafale, on the other hand, there is also a demand for providing Rafale to the Air Force personnel
 mangalvaar (26 farvari) ko jab har taraf pakistan ke balakot main air strike kii charchaa thi to duusari taraf supreme court main rafel vimaan saude se judi punarvichaar yachika par sunwaayee hui
 The court decided to hear in open court the petitions filed to reconsider its previous decision to dismiss the pleas challenging the agreement between India and France to purchase 36 Rafale fighter jets

 yani supreme court se clin chit milane kaa daawa kar rahi bijepi or endie sarkaar ke khilaaf vipaksh ke aaropon par ek baar phir desh kii sarvocch adaalat main sunwaayee hogi
 This decision of the Supreme Court is also considered to be very important because in the wake of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, this is the biggest and important issue for the main opposition party, Congress, to accuse the Modi government of corruption
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne is ladaaku vimaan kii deal main karpshan ke aarope lagaate hue piem narendra modi ko chor tak kah diya he
 Also, through this deal, PM Modi is being accused of looting the country's money and giving it to Anil Ambani

 14 farvari ko pulavama atake ke baad congress ne yah mudda chhod diya or vah aatankwaad ke khilaaf sarkaar ke saath khadi ho gai
 Now, in retaliation of the Pulwama attack, the Air Force has penetrated into the Pakistan border after 48 years from fighter aircraft Mirage and broke its guts, defense experts are saying that Rafale is very important to increase the power of the Air Force
 ajtak par chat sho ke dauraan ritred comoder ji
 J
 singh ne kaha ki hamaare payalton ne puraane miraj vimaanon se yah karnama kiya he
 But the demand of heart-seeking peacock will have to be met by giving Rafael
 unhone kaha ki raajnneetik dalon ko apni takaraar dur kar vayusena ko rafel uplabdh karaane chahie
 It is also being said that if India had Rafael, there would be no need to go inside the Pakistan border
 isse pehle supreme court ne 14 disambar, 2018 ko is deal ko chunauti dene vaali yachikaayen khaarij karte hue kah diya tha ki deal radd karne or vimaan kharid kii prakriya par andeh karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Permission to hear Rafael's demand and reconsideration petition in the Supreme Court has brought alive the issue of Rafale fighter jet once again, despite the revenge of the Pulwama attack

 Gayle and Kohli being dismissed cheaply, David Warner (328 runs) of New South Wales deserved the golden bat while Trinidad and Tobago's Ravi Rampal (12 wickets) deserved the golden wicket

 Dabangporan-2, 1998 was the brightest moment in Vajpayee's career
 unhone parmaanu pareekshan kar anukaraniya duuradrushti, saaf najariye or drudh vishwaas kaa parichay diya
 This gave India an opportunity to increase its nuclear weapons capability and laid the foundation for a civil nuclear deal with the US, ending the nuclear discrimination against India forever

 In addition to a large table, two simple sofa sets on which visitors sit by push-ups

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who came to this office after taking the oath of Prime Minister again on March 19, 1998, did not change anything

 Abdul Kalam and Atomic Energy Commission Chairman R
 chidambaram ko apane daftar bulaayaa or parmaanu pareekshan kii sambhaavnaaon par charchaa kii
 After taking office, people were surprised by Vajpayee's decision to move forward on the nuclear issue so soon
 bahut kam log hi jaanate the ki may 1996 main pradhanmantri ke rup main apane pehle kaarykaal main hi unhone parmaanu pareekshan kaa aadesh diya tha, par 13 dinon main hi unki sarkaar gir jane ke kaaran vah faisla radd karnaa padaa
 He was also worried about this in 1998
 vaajapeyi bhalee-bhaanti jaanate the ki ve gathbandhan vaali najuk sarkaar kii aguai kar rahe hai or vakt beetaa ja rahaa he
 So he showed speed
 jab kalam or chidambaram ko unke karyaalay lekar aayaa gaya tab vaajapeyi apni mej ke peeche baithe the
 Chidambaram brought with him some diagrams on a plastic sheet for the meeting
 vaajapeyi ne brajesh mishra ko bhi bulaayaa tha, jinhen pichhali dopaher hi unka mukhya sachiv niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Chidambaram came directly to the point
 unhone vaajapeyi ko bataaya ki pradhanmantri ke rup main 1996 main unhen jo pichhali brifing di gai thi, tab se lekar aaj tak, team hydrogen bam banane kii sthiti main pahunch chuki he
 Vajpayee was very happy to hear this
 phir elstrishan ke jariye chidambaram ne parmaanu bam or hydrogen bam kaa fark samajhaayaa
 But when the nuclear power chief started going into too much detail, Vajpayee looked a little clumsy
 phir ve kalam kii ore mude or poocha, kitne din lagenge? kalam kaa jawaab tha, "sar, tii mines 30 days
 When Vajpayee was confused, Kalam smiled and said that it meant 30 days from the day the trial order was passed
 vaajapeyi ne unhen pareekshan kii taiyaari shuru karne ko kaha or yah kehete hue baithak samaapt kar di ki vaajapeyi unhen bataa denge ki ve kab aadesh paarit karenge
 In the meantime, the Prime Minister asked Mishra to assess the effects of nuclear testing and devise a strategy to deal with international sanctions
 kuch dinon baad mishra ne vaajapeyi ko vastusthiti bataai
 He said that the ground of the tests has already been prepared by the previous governments
 bharat ke chaaron ore kii samrik sthiti kharaab ho gai thi
 Now many countries, including Pakistan, were equipped with missiles, they were also probably equipped with missile nuclear weapon carrying capability, which could pose a threat to India
 iske alaava, 1996 main vyapak parmaanu pareekshan pratibandh sandhi (sitibiti) par hastakshar karne ke saath bharat ke liye parmaanu pareekshan kaa darwaja teji se band ho rahaa tha

 They felt the weight of the decision they were about to take
 itane varshon ke apane anubhav se, bina tarkon ke pahaado kaa boj mahasoos kiye, kisi bhi samasya ke mul tak pahunchane main vaajapeyi ne maharath hasil kar lee thi
 He had a simplicity in his thinking that helped him make fast decisions
 ve maanate the ki agar bharat ko mahanata hasil kerani he, to use sainya rup se bhi shaktishaalee hona padegaa
 He had told one of his colleagues, "we have to be self-sufficient in defense
 ham apni raksha ko dusron ke bharose nahin chhod sakate ki vah aayega or madad karegaa
 Vajpayee was a man of many contradictions
 unhen khud ko shanti kaa maseehaa kaha janaa bhi pasand tha
 This desire is reflected in his poems
 pareekshan se kai saal pehle unhone pakistan or bharat ke bich shanti kaa aahvaan karte hue ek marmasparshi kavita jang na hone denge likhi thiah pyaar karen yaa waar karen
 
 
 / / The blood is the only one who has passed on us / will not allow us to be with the children
 phir bhi 1998 ke pareekshanon ke baad kai logon kii raay thi ki vaajapeyi ne ilaake ko vinaashkari parmaanu sangharsh ke kagaar par laakar khadaa kar diya tha
 i was writing a book on the history of India's atomic bomb, so after the trial i asked for time to meet Vajpayee
 maine unase kai prashn puche jinamein se ek tha ki chunki ve hameshaa se shanti bahaali kaa sandesh dete rahe hai, parmaanu pareekshan kaa nirnay karte vakt kya unke man main bhi mahabharat ke arjuna kii tarah koi vaicharik dwandv tha
 After a few moments of silence, he said in his perpetual style, "there was no need to think too much
 hamen to bas ise puraa karnaa tha
 "he later clarified this by releasing an audio recording of his poems at a ceremony
" It may seem contradictory that a man who writes poems of peace, caused the atomic bombings
 antadrvandv rahe honge par main aapako aashwast kar saktaa hum ki koi antarvirodh nahin tha
 "the circumstances were such that a good situation was created for Vajpayee
" parmaanu bam ko lekar aresas kii bhaavana ugr-rashtrawaad ko dekhte hue is visphot ke saath hi ve kattarpathiyon kii ankhon ke taare ho jate or vaajapeyi ke gaddi par hone se unke agenda ke kamjor padane kii unki ashankaayen mit jaatin
 Vajpayee believed that nuclear weapons were a symbol of capability and strength and this would give India something to be proud of
 pareekshan se nikali kuch abha to nishchit rup se unke vyaktitv ke saath judadi tay thi or ve duvidha main rahane vaale netaa kii apni chhavi ko ek jatke main mitaa dete
 May 11, 1998 was the trial day
 us din unhone dilli ke res course road ke apane aadhikarik awaas par chaar logon ko bulaayaa tha—grih mantri laalkrishna adwani, raksha mantri jorge furnandis, vitt mantri yashavanth sinha or yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh jaswant singh
 They all eagerly awaited the news coming from the Pokaran range in Rajasthan
 ve pradhanmantri kii dining teble ke chaaron ore kursiyon par chupchaap baithe the kyonki pareekshan ke liye nirdhaarit samay se kuch ghanton kii der ho chuki thi
 Kalam finally calls Mishra to inform Pokran about the success of the test
 mishra ne vah khabar vaajapeyi or unke chaaron taraf baithe cabinet mantriyon ko sunai
 a pleasant smile spread on the Prime Minister's face
 baad main, vaajapeyi ne mujhe bataaya, "is kshan kaa varnan karnaa mushkil he, par main us samay santushti or khushi kaa anubhav kar rahaa tha
 "fernandes and Advani had tears of joy in their eyes as soon as they heard the news
" mantriyon ne ek duusare se haath milaayaa or vidaa lee
 Vajpayee then came out of his house, where the press reporters were waiting for him
 iske kuch minute pehle unke bharosemand sahyogi pramod mahajan ne sooyeeboojh kaa parichay dete hue chabutare ke peeche bhartiya dhvaj ko khaastaur par balldrop main lagava rakhaa tha
 Vajpayee read a brief statement stating that nuclear tests were successful and congratulated scientists and engineers on this achievement
 1974 ke visphot ke baad indira gandhi ke bayaan se ek mahatvapurn badlaav darshaate hue, jiske bare main vaajapeyi ne baad main khud bataaya tha, unhone parmaanu visphoton kaa varnan karte hue uske liye "shantipurna'' shabd kaa upyog nahin kiya
 Two days later, on 13 May, India conducted two more successful tests at Pokaran, but this time their intensity was less
 bharat kii parmaanu sthiti par tippanee main koi hichkichaahat nahin dikhaate hue vaajapeyi ne india today ko ek saakshaatkaar main samajhayah "ham apni karrwai ko hichkichaahat ke kisi anaavashyak aavaran se nahin dhankna chaahate hai
 India is now a nuclear weapon state, but our intention has always been peaceful and will remain so
 ''bharat ke 1998 ke visphot ke ek pakhwaade baad javaabi karrwai karte hue pakistan ne bhi jab chah parmaanu pareekshan kiye, to vaajapeyi aashwast ho gaye ki ab donon deshon ke bich tanaav kam ho jayega
 He told a colleague, "now that both countries have expressed that both are nuclear weapons, we cannot afford to go to war
" isse ham ek duusare ke kareeb aa jaaenge or sahyog ke liye rasta khul jayega
 Vajpayee must have been both right and wrong
 iske nau maheene baad 20 farvari, 1999 ko unhone donon deshon ke bich tanaav ghataane or parmaanu yuddh kii ashanka ko kam karne ke tareeke khojane ke liye pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke saath shikhar vaarta ke liye bas se lahore tak kaa safar karke itihaas rach diya
 It felt like a big success
 par pakistan ne kuch maheenon main hi bharose kaa galaa ghont diya
 In May, the Pakistani Army crossed the Line of Control and captured key peaks of Kargil
 pakistan dhamkaane laga ki bharat ne purna yuddh kii ghoshnaa kii to vah parmaanu hathiyaaron ke prayog se peeche nahin hatega
 Meanwhile, the US and several other European countries imposed stringent sanctions against India and Pakistan due to the trial
 vaajapeyi iske liye taiyaar the
 He said, "I was confident that the countrymen were able to face any challenge facing the country due to nuclear testing
" arthvyavastha buniyadi rup se majboot sthiti main thi or meraa maananaa he ki jab baat desh kii suraksha kii ho to hamaare log koi bhi balidaan karne ko taiyaar rahete hai

 One thing i personally know about @ imrankhanptiis that his interest in the shared history of the Indian subcontinent is genuine & far-reaching

 gussaye bijepi ke kaaryakarta thane par pahunch gaye or unhone police karrwai ke virodh main hangaamaa kar diya or tajganj sthit puraani mandi ke paas dharne par baith gaye
 As soon as the news of the ruckus was reported, the top police officers reached the spot

 The administration had then said that action would be taken against whichever policeman was found guilty

 parfectionist kahe jane vaale mashhoor actor aamir khan ne bhi buudhvaar ko agenda aaj tak main shirkat kii
 In the 'agenda-e-aamir' session, he spoke to Tafsil on its socio-political and cinematic aspects
 aaj tak kii ankar shweta singh se baatcheet main unhone saaf kiya ki vah political aadmi to hai, lekin politics main haragij nahin jaaenge
 Read their words, their words
 aap saamaajik sarokaar ke muddon se jude rahete hai, kya aap political aadmi hai?aamir: haa kuch had tak sab hai
 Until every human becomes political, this country will not change completely
 yahaan matlab sabake chunaav ladane se nahin he
 The issue is to be socially aware, so that we can take the right decisions
 meraa manch cinema he, yahaan rahakar main apni takaton ke saath badlaav laa saktaa hum
 But i will not go into politics
 family kii baat karen to
 
 
 Nowadays my son Azad's play school has started
 vah jate vakt paanv pakad letaa he meraa
 Then i lift it in my lap
 mujhe hameshaa laga ki bacchon ke saath kam vakt bitaa paaya
 Thought, 25 years have passed
 phir lagata he ki shaayad is kism kaa insaan hum ki kaam main itnaa kho jaataa hum ki apane jaruri rishton ko jitna vakt dena chahie, nahin de paata
 Now the time has come to accept that i am a little self-centered man
 par mujhe lagata he ki main acha pita or acha pati hum
 What about your films that did not flop? This happens many times
 main jab puraani or flop filmon ko dekhtaa hum, to lagata he ki sabase zyada maine inhen filmon se siikhaa he
 Who wanted to make vaisaa nahin bana paae
 It teaches a lot
 bivi kiran aapaki filmein dekhati hai?haa kiran jab jamiya main padhati thim, to 'rangila' unke course main thi
 Before that he had seen 'qayamat Se Qayamat Tak', seeing that he had worn out his cassette
 kiran or meri cinema kii sensibility alag he, par itani bhi alag nahin, jitani dikhti he
 Now like 'taare Zameen Par', when we created it, there was no idea that it would become so popular
 par ho gai
 But my tag is more of commercial
 itane saalon se kaam kar rahaa hum to kiafiyat aa jaati he ki alag-alag kahaniyon ko lekar aise manch par rakhun, jahaan unhen zyada se zyada log dekh saken
 Like Peepli is live or looking
 sarkari vigyaapan karne kaa matlab sarkaar ko endorse karnaa to nahin he?bilkul nahin
 Advertising the Incredible India does not mean that i am indorsing the government as well
 ye desh kii baat he
 If someone comes to visit, do not take away the bad image of India

 In your opinion, what is the approach of today's youngsters? main apane kaam main itnaa khoyaa rahata hum

 khan rivelari kaa sawaal
 
 
 See, i can answer for myself
 mere man main kisi ke liye negative khyaal nahin he
 i am thankful to my mother for this
 unki parvarish aisi rahi
 So when someone likes work, there is happiness
 mere saath aisa nahin hota ki yaar isane acha kaam kaise kiya
 Why i didn't jab main chota tha or match khel kar aata tha to ammi puuchhati thim ki jeeta yaa haara? main kahata jeeta, phir vah gale laga letin
 She would then say that her mother would have asked her the loser today, but she would have replied that he has lost
 tab mujhe lagata ki maine use haraakar galati to nahin kar di
 Ammi's upbringing was like this
 jab main kisi kaa kaam dekhtaa hum, jaise maine munnabhai main sanju kaa kaam dekha, to itnaa majaa aayaa
 When i saw Ranbir's work, in Barfi, it felt very good
 isamen compatishan kii feeling kaise aa sakati he
 How will i become bad with their good work
 kya he is soch kii vajah
 
 
 ? As a child, i used to play tennis a lot
 kaaphi acha tha
 Was a rank player in Sub Junior in Maharashtra
 match ke pehle tence rahata tha
 i could not sleep
 match khel aata, to ammi puuchhati jeeta yaa haara
 Usually the answer would be yes, she would have hugged, then after ten minutes she would ask, the boy who lost you, he must have reached home at this time
 uski ammi ne poocha hoga, jeeta yaa haara or unhen bahut bura lag rahaa hoga
 i immediately started to understand why i defeated
 to ammi kii parvarish aisi thi
 She was not teaching by thinking
 par phir bhi sikhaa diya ki har insaan ko duusare kaa sochna chahie
 This ability is not there at all

 Aamir asked Mr
 Perfectionist on the contrast of 'taare Zameen Par' When Amol Gupte came, i said that when i produce, the director also keeps his choice
 unhen ye shart pataa thi
 After spending 6 months, i felt that Amol had to do it

 Why do politics addresses become so rude during election season
 raajnneeti main 'gandi baat' kyon hoti he
 BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad and Congress in-charge of Congress Ajay Maken reached the agenda till date to discuss this
 raajnneetik shishtachar ke kuch puraane udhaaharan yaad dilaate hue ajay maakan ne kaha ki kuch din pehle bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne kaha tha ki ve sansad main achche vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaana chaahate hai, iskaa swaagat kiya janaa chahie
 In 2010, Murli Manohar Joshi said that i welcome the way in which Rahul Gandhi is going to the people
 maine sushamaa ke pair chhue, unhone gale laga liya: makanjay maakan ne yaad dilaayaa, 'main 1998 main ekmaatr chunaav haara
 From Delhi, against Sushma Swaraj
 chunaav ke baad jo harata he, vah jaakar badhai detaa he
 When i went to Sushma ji
 vah mujhase badi thim
 Then i was 33–34 years old
 main gaya, pair chhue
 Hands up and said you have won the election, i have come to congratulate you
 sushamaa ji ne mujhe gale se laga liya
 We have political examples, both good and dirty
 'chunki shisht udaahranon ke zikr kaa mauka tha to ravishankar prasad bhi bole ki kisi din coffee house main ham or maakan ji baithen, or media ko kaise deal karen or ab tak kaise kiya, is par gappein ladayen
 Heart wants to follow Modi: Maken, expressing his goodwill, Maken said, 'I feel very much that i follow Sushma Swaraj or Ravi Shankar Prasad on Twitter
 main chahta hum ki jaanu ki vah kya kah rahe hai
 But the current political scenario is such that it is not possible
 main jaananaa chahta hum ki narendra modi ne kyon twit kiya
 But as soon as i start following them on Twitter, the media will create an atmosphere
 to aaj kii siyasat isaki ijaajat nahin detii darasal
 Media does not show good debates: Maken was discussed on political courtesy but Maken blamed the media
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki media sirf negative chijen dikhaati he
 He said that there are many good debates in Parliament, they are not shown
 agar wel main aakar hangaamaa hua, to bas vahi baar-baar dikhaaya jaataa he
 'when the bullock cart came to Parliament' Atal Ravishankar Prasad said that politics cannot be divided into fields
 jab chaar-paanch lakh logon ke saamne jaaenge, to tanj karenge
 Haas will laugh lekin shaleenta kii seemaa kaa ulanghan nahin hona chahie
 He made an incident, 'in the year 67 there was an israeli-arab war
 petrol kii killat thi
 Indira ji came to Parliament on Tanga
 agle din atal ji baiylgaadee par aae
 So this joke was also used in politics
 'shila hi banengi chauthi baar mukhyamantriajay maakan ne kaha ki nai dilli seat se shila chunaav jeetengi or chauthi baar dilli kii siem banengi
 On Diggi's statement he said that for the last six months all statements of Digvijay Singh have been on the party line
 modi ko hitler bataanaa kahaan thikprasad ne modi ko phenku kahe jane par aitraaj jataayaa or kaha ki yah galat he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Jayaprakash Narayan was called a fascist during Indira's time
 aajkal congress sarkaar ke soochna prasaaran mantri film festival main bhi hamaare netaa ko hitler kehete phirte hai
 Whether there is a reference or not
 prasad ne kaha, 'immergency ke baad chunaav hue
 Congress lost
 jepi dilli aae to sabase pehle indira se milane kaa program banaaya
 When everyone asked what are they doing
 unhone aapako 18 maheene jail rakhaa
 So JP said that i am going to meet my elder brother Jawahar's daughter Indu
 'modi ne nahin udaaya sonia kaa majaak: prasadprasad ne kaha ki madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj garima kaa khyaal rakhte hai
 And for them Digvijay Singh of Congress says in mild language that Pappu failed
 modi kaa bachaav karte hue prasad ne kaha ki jab unhone sonia ko biimaar kaha to unka makasad majaak udaana nahin tha
 To this Maken replied that since i became the head of the media cell
 hamane ye tay kiya he ki kisi bhi netaa kii halaki baat kaa samarthan na kiya jaae

 unheen kii jubaani ab is maamle main aise aise raaj khul rahe hai, jise sunakar aap bhi hairaan rah jaaenge
 Investigations by the police and the ATS so far have revealed that these five vicious beauties took advantage of the colorful moods of more than 20 influential people, not one or two or five, and made pornographic videos of them

 Police investigations have revealed that apart from trapping clients in the club, these vicious beauties used to visit high-profile parties to hunt their victims
