 Journalists stayed for 2-3 matches following the previous reply to Team India's captain MS Dhoni's retirement, but once again after the UAE match, Dhoni was asked the question whether his Asia Cup final in Bangladesh The final match is going to happen
 fark bas itnaa tha ki is baar ye sawaal bhartiya patrkaar ne nahin balki bangladeshi patrkaar ne poocha tha or shaayad ye fark dhoni ke liye kaaphi tha
 This time he answered this question
 dhoni ne sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki aapako mujhase itani jaldi chhutkaaraa nahin milane ja rahaa
 Bangladesh will have to face me even further
 ab dhoni ne ye jawaab isliye diya ki world se pehle or uske dauraan unase dobaaraa ye sawaal na poocha jaae or unke sanyas se zyada focus team ke pradarshan or maichon par rahe, lekin is jawaab kaa saaf matlab yah he ki dhoni ko aap vishwa cap ke baad bhi khelte dekhte rahenge or jis tarah se bhartiya team kaa pradarshan he, to lagata nahin ki wo jaldi hi is fomert se sanyas lenge
 The comments vaise, bhartiya patrakaron ke nirantar is sawaal ke puche jane par dhoni ne pehle to kuch aisa hi jawaab diya tha ki aap mujhe team se baahar kyon karwaanaa chaahate hai, lekin baar-baar yahi sawaal puche jane par pichhali baar dhoni ne kaha ki jis sawaal kaa jawaab main 15 din pehle de chukaa hum wo ab badal to nahin jayega
 If you ask the same question over and over again, the answer is not going to change
 kuch us tarah se jaise meraa naam mahendra singh dhoni hi rahegaa
 Let Dhoni be hoping that after this answer, now he will not have to face this question again in near time, but will the journalists give up his chase
 ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 Dhoni said in response to the question that you are not going to get rid of me so soon
 bangladesh ko aage bhi meraa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Now Dhoni gave this answer so that he should not be asked this question before and during the World and more than his retirement, the focus was on the team's performance and matches, but this answer clearly means that Dhoni has to give you the World Cup
 Will continue to play after all and the way the Indian team is performing, it is unlikely that they will retire from this format soon
 tippaniyan By the way, on being asked this question of Indian journalists continuously, Dhoni had earlier given some similar answer as to why you want to get me out of the team, but when asked this question again and again, Dhoni said that the question i have given the answer 15 days ago, it will not change now
 aap ek hi sawaal baar-baar puuchhenge, to jawaab nahin badalane vaala
 Something like that my name will be Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 chaliye dhoni apane is jawaab ke baad ummid yahi kar rahe honge ki ab dobaaraa se is sawaal kaa unhen nikat samay main saamana nahin karnaa padegaa, lekin patrkaar kya unka peechha chodenge
 It will be interesting to see
 vaise, bhartiya patrakaron ke nirantar is sawaal ke puche jane par dhoni ne pehle to kuch aisa hi jawaab diya tha ki aap mujhe team se baahar kyon karwaanaa chaahate hai, lekin baar-baar yahi sawaal puche jane par pichhali baar dhoni ne kaha ki jis sawaal kaa jawaab main 15 din pehle de chukaa hum wo ab badal to nahin jayega

 aaj swami vivekanand kaa janmdiwas he, jise puraa desh yuva diwas ke rup main manaa rahaa he
 Narendra Nath was born on 12 January 1863 in Kolkata, later known as Swami Vivekananda
 vivekanand ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki vah khud bhukhe rahakar atithiyon ko khaanaa khilaate the or baahar thand main so jate the
 Vivekananda was of sharp intelligence since childhood
 kam umr main hi unhone veda or darshan shaastra kaa gyaan hasil kar liya tha
 At the same time, whenever Vivekananda is talked about, his speech in the religion parliament of Chicago in the year 1893 is definitely talked about
 125 saal pehle jab swami vivekananda ne apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat 'mere america bhaaiyo or bahanon' kahkar kii thi jiske baad sabhaagaar kai minuton tak taaliyon kii gunj har taraf goonjati rahi
 Let us know the special features of that speech of Swami Vivekananda: - Sisters and brothers of America, my affectionate and emphatic welcome has filled my heart with immense joy and i thank you from the oldest saint tradition of the world
 main aapako sabhi dharmon kii janani kii taraf se dhanyavad detaa hum or sabhi jatiyon, sampradaayon ke lakhon, karodon hinduon kii taraf se aapkaa aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 These 10 things of Swami Vivekananda will make your future - My thanks are also to some speakers, who have told this forum that the idea of tolerance in the world has spread from the countries of the far east
 mujhe garv he ki main ek aise dharm se hum, jisane duniya ko sahansheeltaa or saarvbhaumik sweekruti kaa paath padhaayaa
 We not only believe in universal tolerance, but we accept all religions of the world as the truth
 - mujhe garv he ki main us desh se hum jisane sabhi dharmon or sabhi deshon ke sataae gaye logon ko apane yahaan sharan di
 i am proud that we have cherished in our hearts the sacred memories of Israel in which their shrines were destroyed by the Roman invaders and then they took refuge in South India
 mujhe garv he ki main ek aise dharm se hum jisane parsi dharm ke logon ko sharan di or lagaataar ab bhi unki madad kar rahaa he
 - Brothers, i would like to tell you a few lines of a verse which i have memorized and repeated since childhood and which are repeated every day by crores of people - 'ruchina vaikitrayaudjukutilanapathajusham
 
 
 nrinameko gamyastvamasi payasamarnav ive
 
 
 'it means - Just as different rivers from different sources finally meet in the sea, in the same way man chooses different routes according to his desire, which may look straight or crooked, But all go only to God
 jinhone swami vivekanand ko jindagi ke gur sikhaye the
 
 
 
 - sampradayiktaayen, kattarataayen or inaki bhayanak vanshaj hathdharmita lambey samay se prithvi ko apane shikanjon main jakade hue hai
 They have filled the earth with violence
 kitni hi baar yah dharti khun se laal hui he, kitni hi sabhyataaon kaa vinaash hua he or na jane kitne desh nasht hue hai
 Had these not been terrible demons, human society would have been much more advanced today, but now their time is over
 - mujhe puri ummid he ki aaj is sammelan kaa shankhanaad sabhi hathdharmitaaon, har tarah ke klesh, chaahe ve talwaar se hon yaa kalam se, or sabhi manushyon ke bich kii durbhaawanaaon kaa vinaash karegaa
 BJP President Amit Shah suddenly stopped and turned around while addressing an election rally at Chirhat in Sidhi, Madhya Pradesh on Sunday

 is par amit shah poochhate hai ki baaki vidhansabhaon ke naam kahaan hai? phir shah ne unase kaha ki wo jaaen or baaki vidhansabha ke naamon kii suchi lekar aaen
 After this he goes and brings another page and gives it to Amit Shah
 is dauraan sabhi log amit shah kii ore dekhne lagate hai
 However, Amit Shah starts his speech immediately
 congress par shah kaa waar, kaha- congress privet limited companybata den ki ravivaar ko amit shah churhat main chunavi raily karne pahunche the
 Addressing the election rally there, Amit Shah alleged that the Congress is not a democratic party, which will elect the commander here
 congress nehru gandhi parivaar kii privet limited he
 In addition to BJP President Amit Shah on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also held election rallies in Madhya Pradesh
 is dauraan donon netaaon ne congress or gandhi parivaar par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa
 Addressing an election rally in Churhat in Madhya Pradesh, Amit Shah said that in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress has neither a leader nor a policy nor any principle
 unhone aarope lagaaya kicongressloktantric party nahin hai, jo yahaan par senapati ko chunaa jayega
 The Congress is the private limited party of the Nehru Gandhi family, whose national president is appointed, that too from the Gandhi family
 kisi duusare ko congress party kaa adhyaksh nahin banaaya jaataa he
 Explain that the Congress Party has not yet announced the name of any candidate for the post of Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 congress party bina mukhyamantri chehre ke chunaav maidan par utari he
 At the same time, there is still a lot of time for the Lok Sabha elections, but before that Rahul Gandhi has declared himself as the Prime Ministerial candidate
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne isi ko lekar congress or gandhi parivaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 Modi lashed out at the Congress for not declaring the Chief Ministerial candidate, besides PM Modi taking strong note against the Congress party not announcing the Chief Ministerial candidate in Bhim Madhya Pradesh
 chhindwara main chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki congress ab tak apana netaa tay nahin kar pai he, to wo kaise madhya pradesh main kiye gaye vikaas ke vaadon ko puraa karegi
 He said that all the Congress leaders have their own separate government
 chhindwara aao to yahaan par kamalnath sarkaar, guna-ashokanagar jaao to vahaan sindhiya sarkaar, reva jaao to ajay singh sarkaar, bhopal main jaao to pachori sarkaar or jhabua jaao to vahaan bhuriya sarkaar
 Addressing an election public meeting in Churhat in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday, Amit Shah said, 'it is the tradition of the BJP, when we go to the polls, give account of Palpal and pie-pie
 ' unhone kaha ki congress ek aisi ATM he, jisamen samasya daalane par jawaab vikaas main nahin aata, balki jhuthe vaadon main baahar aata he or bhaajapa vikaas kaa ATM he

 Amidst all this, Dhoni's failed Test captaincy continues in an autocratic manner
 
 
 dhoni: cricket khilaadi, captain yaa chatur rajanetapahle ek najar aankadon par
 From 2000 to 2010, India played 41 Tests abroad, losing only 14
 lekin 2011 se ab tak khele gaye 23 test main se 15 ganvaae ja chuke hai
 This is the era of Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 simit overon ke maichon main jahaan desh ne jabardast pradarshan kiya, khitaab jite, vahiin cricket ke is sabase puraane formet main lagaataar pitayee ho rahi he
 Apart from this, the interesting fact is that while our team seems united in T20 and ODI matches, during the Test, there are stories of mutual differences, quarrels
 taaja maamla viraat kohli or shikhar dhawan kaa he
 The news came that there was a scuffle between the two on the fourth day of the Gaba Test
 guuruuvaar ko dhoni ne is baat kii safai behad vyangyatmak lahaze main di
 Told that yes, Kohli attacked Dhawan with a knife
 uske thik hote hi hamane use batting ke liye bhej diya
 Dhoni again became serious that any player who has raised this rumor should join a film company instead of Team India, where such fictional story is used
 ab is puure maamle se jo 3 baaten ubharkar aati hai, ve kuch is tarah hai-1
 The calmness with which Dhoni was speaking meant that the estrangement in the team (rumor is correct) was not deterring him at all
 2
 If they were talking about the existence of a player behind the birth of this story, then it is certain that not all players have the same confidence in their captaincy
 yani manmutav to he
 3
 yadi kohli or dhawan vivaad afvaah he or dhoni team kii ekta ke prati aashwast hai to phir kisi or khilaadi ko is vivaad main shaamil karne kaa kya tuk tha, ki vah afvaah uda rahaa he
 Is it not so that he did this to divert the news about his poor captaincy
 pichley chaar varshon ke dauraan hui test siries main hi sahvaag, gautam gambhir, harbhajan singh or jahir khan se jude vivaadon kii khabaren ain
 The truth was never known, but gradually all of them moved out of Team India
 har baar batch gaye captain
 This is usually seen in political parties, where such news comes about the pull of power or positions
 yaa phir kisi chunaav main hui haar se dhyaan hataane ke liye
 Dhoni has won only two victories on foreign soil in the last four years
 yadi bhartiya team melbern test haar jaati he to vah isisi test ranking main saatven sthaan par chali jaaegi, sirf westeindies, bangladesh or zimbabwe se upar

 The price of this smartphone at the time of launch is Rs 28,990
 haalanki is smartphone kii bikri market main may se shuru hui he
 i have tested this smartphone for a long time and this review is based on this
 Samsung Galaxy A7 dizin, disple or bild qualityis smartphone kii bild quality aivarej he
 Neither plastic, nor glass - but it is a glass body

 There are three rear cameras on the rear panel and LED flash is given below it

 The bottom has a USB Type c port, 3
 5mm headphone jaik or spikar gril diya gaya he
 The first thing you will notice in Galaxy A70 is that the screen of this phone is big
 isamen 6
 a 7-inch Super AMOLED display is provided
 ol disple smartphone he or water drop style noch diya gaya he
 There is a full screen, just marked below
 ye smartphone kitna durable he isaki testing nahin kii he
 But the phone is thin, it takes a bit of delicacy to use
 rier panel fingerprint maganet he or finger ke impressant aasaani se dikhte hai
 The Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 octacore chipset has been given in the performance Samsung Galaxy A70
 is smartphone main 6GB ram ke saath 128GB kii internal storage di gai he
 Micro SD card support is also provided

 The chipset provided in the Samsung Galax A70 is built at 11nm and it has an Octacore CPU
 keemat ko dekhen to company isamen or behatar prosesar de sakati thi
 But still the performance is fine and this smartphone does not disappoint you
 disple badi he is vajah se videos dekhne, game khilne or duusare graphics vaale ap yuj karne ke dauraan hamaara anubhav shandaar rahaa he
 The company has done a lot of work on the software and it is quite easy to use
 yujar interphes ko simple rakhane kii puri koshish kii gai he
 The under display fingerprint scanner is quite improvised
 screen kii bottm ke paas under disple fingerprint scinar he
 The special thing is that the phone's display is not on, yet as soon as you touch the bottom of the screen, the under display fingerprint sensor will work and the phone will be unlocked
 multi tasking ke liye ye smartphone kaaphi behatar he, ek saath kai ap chalaa sakate hai
 Switching apps is quite smooth
 lekin kai baar isamen thodi dikkat ai he khule hue ap lod hone main pareshaani he
 But the phone doesn't hang, that's a good thing
 gaming bhi kar sakate hai, hamane pabaji khel kar tri kiya he or becoground main kuch eps bhi the
 The experience of playing PUBG has also been good due to the bigger and better screen
 Samsung Galaxy A70 main soshal media se jude eps yuj karne main koi pareshaani nahin he
 It will run very smooth and will run fast
 audio quality kii baat karen to is department main ye divaais thik thaak he
 Bottom Line - Samsung Galaxy A70 is a good phone in terms of performance
 khaas kar is segment main, lekin ek baar phir se ye kah saktaa hum ki, is divaais kaa parformens isamen di gai disple se or bhi Amazing ban jaataa he
 Camera Samsung Galaxy A70 has three rear cameras
 isamen 32 megapixl kaa primary camera he, iskaa aparchar f / 1
 Is 7
 doosraa camera 8 megapixl kaa he or ye wide angel lens he or iskaa aparchar f / 2
 Is 2 teesraa lens 5 megapixl kaa he jo depth sensor ke taur par diya gaya he
 For selfie too, it has a 32 megapixel sensor, which has an aperture f / 2
 0 he
 There are many options in this smartphone in terms of photography
 is phone kaa wide angel lens kaaphi badhiya he
 Whether it is photo or video, the wide angle lens provided in it affects both
 camere main kai fitures die gaye hai, itane fitures hai ki aap kanphyus ho jaaeng ki kya yuj karen or kya nahin
 If you like a clean camera interface then it can be a bit troublesome for you
 lekin agar aapako camere se alag alag fitures yuj karnaa acha lagata he to phir koi baat nahin
 Talking about the main features of the camera, it has a super slow mo which you will like a lot, the second feature is Live Focus which you can also call the bokeh effect
 ye bhi acha he
 Apart from this, an option of AR emoji has also been given, which people rarely use
 Galaxy A70 se raushnee yaa outdoor main acchhee photography to kar sakate hai, lekin kam raushnee main iskaa camera bilkul prabhavit nahin karata he
 There is also no dedicated mode for low light photography in this smartphone
 photose main grain kaaphi dekhne ko milenge
 For high res photography, you have to go into settings and activate it
 photose main color or contrast sahi hai, lekin focus karne main thodaa vakt lagata he
 It should have been faster
 phone main diya gaya ultra wide angal camera se clic kii gai tasveeron main ditels nahin hongi
 The coverage area is quite a lot and many things will come in one frame and you can be happy with it
 lekin isaki jo final quality hogi usase shaayad aap prabhavit nahin honge
 Talking about selfie, this smartphone affects here
 clic kii gai selfi main ditels dikhengi or quality bhi acchhee milegi
 Mode for selfie like Galaxy S10 series is also given in it
 selfi camera main ek hi lens he, lekin yahaan aapako wide or jumd mod kaa opshan miltaa he
 Being a lens, the company has used software tricks to zoom
 software ke jariye hi company portret mod kaa bhi feechar selfi camera main diya he
 It works fine here too
 portret mod jise kehete hai wo clic karata he jaise becoground ko subject se thik tareeke se alag karata he or bler bhi karata he, lekin agar apke chehre par kuch he yaa bal zyada idhar udhar hai to yahaan ye portret mod fail hota he
 Bottom line - Samsung Galaxy A70's camera is good
 tasviren acchhee clic hoti hai, khaas kar selfi ke liye ye smartphone zyada acha he
 Also better for video
 bydaricshamsung Galaxy A70 main 4,500mah kii bydaree di gai he
 The phone's battery backup is Decent
 mixd yuj karte he to puure din kii byaap aaraam se milegaa or standbai par rakhte hai to puure raat bhi chalegaa
 Heavy usage consumes battery fast and the reason is the display given in it
 phone ke saath super fast charging kaa saport bhi diya gaya he
 It has taken us about one and a half hours to do this full charge
 kya aapako Samsung Galaxy A70 khareednaa chahie?galaxy A70 is segment main acha smartphone he
 If you have to buy a great display, decent performance and better looking smartphone then this smartphone is for you
 agar aapako pyor photography ke liye phone khareednaa he to ye smartphone aapke liye nahin he

 The action of illegal slaughterhouses is also being seen on the lions of Etawah Lion Safari
 sheron ko unke mutabik gosht nahin mil paa rahaa
 Goat meat is being given to keep them alive
 gosht saploir ne bataai apni pareshanigosht supplai karne vaale thekedaar haji nizaam kaa kahana he ki abhi tak sheron ke liepadde (bhens) kaa goshtupalabdh karaayaa jaataa tha
 But due to not getting that meat, 50 kg goat meat is being sent every day to the lions
 thekedaar ke mutabik isse unhen bahut ghaataa ho rahaa he, lekin sher bhukhe naa mare, isliye wo bakre kaa gosht uplabdh kara rahe hai
 Haji Nizam also says that he does not know how many days he will be able to do this
 thekedaar ne rajya sarkaar se apil main kaha ki is taraf tatkaal dhyaan de or kam se kam line safari main sheron kii khatir padde kaa gosht uplabdh karaane kii ijaajat de di jaae
 Even now, Akhilesh's board was put up as CM 'till today' reached the Etawah Lion Safari for the reality check, there still appeared a board that said 'babbar Lion Breeding Center and Lion Safari in Etawah, Honorable Akhilesh Yadav, Chief Minister, Government of Uttar Pradesh 'A warm welcome and welcome'

 3 pairs of lion-lionesses, two cubs in Lion Safari
 Please tell that Etawah is considered to be the stronghold of Mulayam Singh Yadav family
 itawa ko tourist map par jagah dene ke liye hi purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne yahaan line safari kadream projectoshuru kiya
 At this time, there are three pairs of lionesses in safari
 haal hi me sherni jesica ne do shavakon- sultan or sambha ko bhi janm diya
 Lion Safari has been Akhilesh's Dream Project
 It has more than three dozen deer in the Deer Safari in addition to the lions in the Etawah Safari Park
 akhilesh yadav sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan yahaan bhaaluon or tenduon ko bhi laane kii yojana banaai gai thi
 a total of four safaris were to be built here, out of which the deer safari was inaugurated by Akhilesh Yadav on 6 October 2016
 chunaav aachaar samhita lagane se pehle yahaan restaurant, 4D theatre kaa kaam puraa nahin ho jane kii vajah se taal diya gaya tha
 By the way, the Samajwadi Party government made a fixed deposit of 100 crores for the work of Etawah Safari
 taaki byaaj se hi kharche puure kiye jate rahen
 Apart from this, there was a provision to raise money through tickets from the people coming on safari
 itawa safari park kii vyavastha ko dekhne ke liye ek cameti he, jiske paden adhyaksh rajya ke mukhyamantri hai
 Apart from this, many officers including the Forest Secretary of the state are also included in this committee
 itawa safari park kaa kya bhavishya hoga ye to ab lakhanu se nai sarkaar ke nirdeshon par hi nirbhar karegaa
 But the lions here do not know that changing the political atmosphere of Lucknow will be made on their food
 dekhnaa he ki kab sheron ko unke mutabik gosht kaa intjaam phir shuru ho paata he

 dilli nagar nigam chunaavon main haar ke baad aam aadmi party main baithkon kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 Late night, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal held a meeting with mlas in which the mistakes and evms during the election were also discussed
 party pravaktaa sanjay singh ne baithak ke baad kaha ki party ko badlaav kii jarurat he or kuch badlaav kiye jaaenge
 He said that the party will try to overcome its shortcomings
 vidhayakon or nae parshadon ke saath baithak main arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha ki aap logon ne kisi ne is andolan ko dhokhaa diya to ye samaj lenaa is bhagwaan ko dhokhaa diya he
 Once there may be someone who gives you greed or gives 10 crore rupees to leave the party and come
 inke paas bahut paisa he ye kuch bhi de sakate hai lekin ek cheez soch lenaa agar aap is andolan ko or is party or logon kii ummid ko dhokhaa de kar gaye to zindagi main sukhi nahin rah paaoge
 Double that, God will squeeze three times the amount of money from you and he will squeeze with great difficulty
 pidaa dekar nichodega aapse
 After this news came out, questions were raised about the stand of Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal whether Arvind Kejriwal does not trust his councilors and mlas or he is showing fear of God to the councilors
 kya parshad laalchee hai? yaa phir arvind kejariwal dar rahe hai? Sanjay Singh answered these questions to NDTV that Arvind Kejriwal believes in God
 so aksar vah kehete hai ki ishwar ne hamen jimmedaari di he, jise sahi rup main nibhaana jaruri he
 This thing is being ruled unnecessary
 jab logon ne unhen aam aadmi party par vishwaas ke chalate chunaa he to unhen bhi kaam karnaa chahie
 If you come under a mission for a sacred purpose, then you should work with the party
 dhokhaa dene vaale vyakti ko ishwar kyon maaf karegaa
 The comments yah khabar saamne aane ke baad aam aadmi party or arvind kejariwal ke rukh ko lekar sawaal uthne lage ki kya arvind kejariwal ko apane parshadon or vidhayakon par bharosa nahin he yaa phir vah parshadon ko bhagwaan kaa dar dikhaa rahe hai
 Are councilors greedy? Or is Arvind Kejriwal afraid? in sawaalon kaa jawaab sanjay singh ne enditivi ko diya ki arvind kejariwal ishwar main vishwaas rakhte hai
 So often he says that God has given us the responsibility, which needs to be fulfilled properly
 is baat ko anaavashyak kii tool diya ja rahaa he
 When people have chosen him for faith in the Aam Aadmi Party, he should also work
 pavitra uddeshy ke liye ek mishan ke tahat aaen hai to party ke saath kaam karnaa chahie
 Why would God forgive a cheating person? tippaniyan Sanjay Singh answered these questions to NDTV that Arvind Kejriwal believes in God
 so aksar vah kehete hai ki ishwar ne hamen jimmedaari di he, jise sahi rup main nibhaana jaruri he
 This thing is being ruled unnecessary
 jab logon ne unhen aam aadmi party par vishwaas ke chalate chunaa he to unhen bhi kaam karnaa chahie
 If you come under a mission for a sacred purpose, then you should work with the party
 dhokhaa dene vaale vyakti ko ishwar kyon maaf karegaa

 Now a new name has been included in this list and that is Delhi University (DU)
 diu ke 28 collejon ko dilli sarkaar fund detii he or saath hi gavarning cameti main apane log niyukt karti he
 The new difficulty of the Aam Aadmi Party government is that DU has started reinstatement in colleges without government representation

 In fact, the new problem is linked to the recruitment of professors and staff in the 28 colleges to which the Delhi government provides the money
 maamla ye he ki har college kii gavarning cameti main sarkaar kii ore se 5 sadsy niyukt hote hai, jinke liye kejariwal sarkaar ne philhal vigyaapan nikaal rakhaa he
 Arvind Kejriwal government has clarified its position on this issue many times
 siem arvind kejariwal kaa kahana he ki hamane collejon main aise logon ko laane kii koshish kii he jo siyaasi na hon
 The government representatives are not even appointed yet and the government alleges that colleges are appointing new professors and employees on their behalf
 sarkaar ko jaise hi is baat kii jaankaree mili to khud ucch shiksha mantri manish sitaudiya ne dilli uniwarsity ke visi dinesh singh ko chitthee likhi or kaha ki ye bhartiyon tab tak roki jaaen jab tak sarkari numaayinde niyukt nahin hote
 But this letter from the Registrar of Delhi University gave a sharp reply to Manish Sisodia that the appointments are being done on the basis of rules and for any meeting of the Governing Committee, only one third of the total members are required
 ab dilli sarkaar tilamilaai hui he or ye tak soch rahi he ki in collejon ke liye jo 128 karod ke fund kaa praavdhaan he use bhi roka ja saktaa he

 sarkaar ne yah bhi bataaya ki pichley teen varshon ke dauraan akhabaaron yaa phir vyaktiyon or sanghathanon ke jariye 88 safaikarmiyon kii maut kii soochna mili
 In 2014, however, several reports mentioned that the relatives of the scavengers who died did not get compensation

 In the month of July itself, the number has crossed 90
 teenon emsidi ne milakar dengue ke larva ko khatm karne kii khaas muhim shuru kii he
 But it does not seem to have an effect
 pichley hafte hi dilli main dengue ke marijo kii sankhya 50 thi lekin is hafte 40 nae maamle saamne aae he jisamen se 15 dilli ke hai jabaki 25 baahar ke he
 In view of the ever increasing dengue cases in the capital, instructions have also been given to keep a special watch in hospitals
 philhal 90 marij dengue kii chapet main he jabaki kareeb 24000 se adhik gharon main dengue ke larva paae gaye the
 In spite of all precautions, dengue mosquitoes are spreading fast in the capital
 dakshini dilli se hai dengue ke zyaadaatar kesafilhal 90 logon main dengue kii pushti ho chuki he
 Delhi has the highest number of cases from Delhi
 nagar nigam or nai dilli nagar palika parishad kii ore se bhi karmchaariyon ko nirdesh diya gaya he ki vah aspataal parisar par dhyaan den
 The most surprising thing is that dengue mosquitoes are growing rapidly in the staff quarters of hospitals
 dakshini dilli main abhi 24000 gharon se larva mila he jisamen 15000 logon ko notice bhi diya he
 Last year, 60 people died, due to extreme precautions, there is no reduction in the case of mosquito mosquito
 pichley saal bhi dengue dilli main kahar banakar tutaa tha
 About 60 people died due to this
 jabaki 15000 ke kareeb log iske chapet main aae the
 So far this year, no death has been reported in this regard, but the increasing case of dengue has increased the danger for Delhiites
 lakhanu main tainaat uttar pradesh police ke 42 varshiya inspector ne apane ghar par pankhe se latakkar aatmahatya kar lee
 The deceased was identified as Brijesh Kumar, posted at the state's emergency helpline '112'
 ravivaar kii shaam ko der se aane par kumaar or unki patni ke bich jhagada hua tha jiske baad unhone khud ko apane kamare main band kar liya
 If he was upset about something or there was a fight in the family, he would often lock himself in the room
 unki patni maaya ne mangalvaar ko unhen baahar bulaane kii koshish kii lekin koi pratikriya nahin mili
 There was a door on the outer side of the room and he felt that he had gone out
 baad main shaam ko unhone khidki se kamare main jhaanka to unki cheekh nikal gai
 The neighbors heard their screams and rushed to the house and saw that the inspector's body was hanging from the ceiling fan
 iske baad police ko bulaayaa gaya or unhone shav ko neeche utaara jise postmortem ke liye bhej diya gaya
 With this, another case was added to the list of suicide by police personnel
 pichley maheene, 8 oktober ko, consteble raaj ratan verma ne 20 ghante kii shift karne ke baad aatmahatya kar lee thi
 In September, sub-inspector Dharmendra Kumar Mishra committed suicide due to frequent transfers

 But the main contest is believed to be between Congress, BJP and Aam Aadmi Party
 prachaar ke aakhri din zyaadaatar partiyon ke bade netaa dilli main maujuud honge or jamkar prachaar karenge
 On Sunday, top leaders of major parties tried to reach more and more voters and made many promises while more than 25 rallies and dozens of roadshows were organized across the city
 bijepi kii ore se varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani or pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne kaman sanbhali or unhone vibhinn muddon ko lekar shila dikshit sarkaar kii tikhi aalochana kii tathaa logon se pichley 15 saal se sattarudh bhrasht sarkaar ko hataane ke liye is maukey kaa upyog karne kii apil kii
 Addressing a large crowd in South Delhi's Dakshinpuri, Modi attacked the Sheila Dixit government fiercely and alleged that this government was completely submerged in corruption
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar dilli kii pramukh samasyaon ke hal main naakaam rahi he
 On behalf of the BJP, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari, Amit Shah, Najma Heptulla, Vinod Khanna, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Navjot Singh Sidhu held several rallies in support of the party candidates
 congress kii ore se mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne chunaav prachaar kaa netritv kiya or unhone saat chunavi sabhaayen kin
 He accused the opposition parties of misleading the people of Delhi to gain power
 unhone logon se nirantarata or samaveshi vikaas ke liye matdaan karne ko kaha
 Addressing a rally in Kamla Nagar area of model Town Assembly constituency, Dixit said, "we have changed the picture of Delhi in the last 15 years
" lekin kaam puraa nahin hua he
 We need your support so that the development agenda can continue
 bijepi ke vijend gupta or aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal raily ke dauraan aamane saamne najar aae
 BJP candidate from New Delhi Assembly seat Vijender Gupta asked people to vote for BJP
 nai dilli seat dilli ke chunavi dangal ke centre main he kyonki yahaan muqabla siem shila dikshit, bijepi se vijendra gupta or aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal ke bich he
 It remains to be seen who the people will choose as their leader from this area
 udhar basapa pramukh mayawati ne apane chunaav abhiyaan ke tisare din do reliyaan main matadaataaon ko sambodhit kiya
 He addressed rallies in Trilokpuri and Dwarka
 unhone samprag sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue aarope lagaaya ki uski galat nitiyon ke kaaran aavashyak vastuon kii keemton main vruddhi huyi he jisase desh ke garib evam madhyam varg se kaaphi prabhavit hua he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar addressed two rallies in support of JDU
 vahiin aam aadmi party ke netaaon ne bhi kai reliyon ko sambodhit kiya or sarkaar main aane par bhrashtachar samaapt karne kaa vaayada kiya
 Another chapter has been added to the politics of mangoes started in the politics of Bihar
 nitish jab patna se dilli pahunche, to ek hajaar peti aam lekar pahunche
 These were common for special officers and leaders
 haalanki jediu kaa kahana he ki aise aam to nitish har saal baantate hai
 Interestingly, recently, former Chief Ministers Jitan Ram Manjhi and Nitish Kumar had a lot of ruckus about the people
 darasal patna ke 1 ane maarg sthit siem nivas ko jeethanram maanjhi ne abhi tak khaali nahin kiya he
 There are many mango and lychee trees in the CM housing, as well as many vegetables
 siem nitish kumaar ne yahaan pulicekarmiyon kii fouj tainaat kar di, taaki maanjhi kaa parivaar fal-subjiyan na tod sake
 Up to 8 sub-inspectors and 16 constables were employed in this work
 bihar ke purv siem jeethanram maanjhi ke maujuuda sarkari awaas paraam-lichi ke pedonki nigaraanee main police tainaat kiye jane kaa maamla media main aane ke baadasiem nitish kumaarane turant safai di
 Nitish said, "we are worried about people, while Manjhi has mangoes
" ' udhar, jeethanram maanjhi ne aarope lagaaya ki dalit hone kii vajah se unhen pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he
 Manjhi said, "well, is this also an issue?" This shows Nitish's mindset
 ' Delhi's air is highly polluted
 iskaa nuksaan yahaan rahane waalon logon ko ho rahaa he
 The situation has worsened, especially for people suffering from respiratory diseases
 dilli kii hawa main RSPM (respirable suspended partculate matter) kii maatra bad gai he, jis kaaran se saans sambandhit maamle zyada saamne aa rahe hai
 The level of RSPM in 2007 was 161 μg / m3 (cubic meter on microgram) which increased to 316 μg / m3 in 2014
 yah report indian express ne di he
 The highest winter pollution in Delhi is in the report that 7 years ago when the Supreme Court mandated the use of CNG in public transport, there was a big fall in the amount of air pollution
 lekin ab ek baar phir sthiti badtar ho chali he, vallabhbhai patel chest institute or ames main zyada log saans or chaati sambandhit shikaayatein lekar pahunch rahe hai
 a few years ago the situation was different
 patel chest institute main 2003-04 main opidi main 51,694 marij aae jo 2006-07 main ghatakar 47887 ho gaya, haalanki 2013-14 main yah aankada badhkar 65122 pahunch gaya
 AIIMS is in a similar situation

 Film Name: Tanu Weds Manu Returns Director: Anand L
 Raystar Cast: Kangana Ranot, r Madhavan, Jimmy Shergill, Deepak Dobriyal, Swara Bhaskar Duration: 120
 12 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 4
 5 stars This year, a lot of films have knocked at the box office with many experiments
 kisi ne kahani chhupaai or relies ke baad film aundhe munh gir gai
 But there were some filmmakers who have already told the audience what is in their film
 jaahir taur par theme kii jaankaree hone par darshak usee maddenjar film dekhne pahunche
 Recently 'piku' has entertained the audience with a great screenplay and simple, simple yet sweet story
 baap-beti ke rishton par aadhaarit is film ko janata kaa khub pyaar bhi mila, vahiin ab lekhak himanshu sharma or diarector anand el raay darshakon ke liye 'tanu vaids manu riterns' main sikval kaa tadakaa lekar aae hai
 Although the promos of the film already tell that it is based on the story of 'pati Patni Ora Woh', but the style of serving this film made by the artisans is obviously tempting
 kahani:pichhali film 'tanu vaids manu' se aage badhati is kahani main tanu urf tanuja trivedi(kangana ranot)or NRI landan besd doctor manu urf manoj sharma(aar madhavan)kii shaadi ho chuki he
 In the early part of the film, this is shown through excellent credits
 nai film shaadi ke chaar saal baad shuru hoti he
 In this, as in normal life, there has been a spurt between husband and wife
 halaat bad se badtar hote hai or baat talaak tak pahunch jaati he
 Kanpur returns to her home from Tanulandan
 jabaki manu ko bhi uskaa dost pappi (deepak dobariyaal) kisi tarah maan-manaakar landan se waapas kanpur le aata he
 Further developments in the story are such that Manu has to go to Delhi and there he meets Athlit Kusum alias Datto (kangana Ranot) from Jhajjar district of Haryana
 kusum ko pehali najar main dekhte hi manu ko pyaar ho jaataa he
 That is, there is now an entry of 'that' between the husband and wife in the story
 ab baat nikali he to dur talak jaaegi
 The story takes many turns
 ghatnaayen ghatati hai
 Tanu meets her old lover King Awasthi (jimmy Shergill)
 kabhi tanu raja ke saath gumti najar aati he to kabhi manu or pappi kaa datto or uski saheli ke saath ghoomana-phirana hota he
 In the end the film ends with a better decision amidst all the confusion, thoughts and uproar
 script or acting:is film kii jaan yaa yah kahen ki 'hero' isaki script he
 The way Himanshu Sharma has threaded the story is a compliment
 baat kanpuria lahaze kii ho yaa sadakon se lekar gali-muhallon kii
 Every scene, every character has their own distinct impression in the film
 kahani darshak ko apni si lagati he
 There is also a period of laughter between love, marriage, relationships and complications
 kangana ranot ne is film main bhi abhinay kala ke sheersh ko chuaa he
 She tells critics that she has not received the National Award
 tanuja trivedi kaa luk, datto kaa rahan-sahan, uske bolne kaa lahaza
 Kangana has proved herself in everyone
 donon kirdaar ek-duusare se alag hai, lekin kangana bollywood kii 'queen' hai or unka kaam prashansaneey or saraahneey he
 He is indeed 'batman of the locality'
 aar madhavan ne manu sharma ke rup main ek pati or premi donon kaa kirdaar bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 Especially in the film's climax, Madhavan has done amazing work
 unki comic timming or dialog delivery hansane par majaboor kar detii he
 It is nice to hear 'I am an orange that the juice will be filled' or 'I had sex on Bhaiya Dooj' from his mouth with a serious look on his face
 deepak dobariyaal (pappi) parde par jab bhi aate hai darshak ke chehre par hansi tairne lagati he
 While Jimmy Shergill has done justice to the character in the role of Swara Bhaskar and Raja Awasthi as Payal
 jishaan ayub bhi behtareen parformar banakar ubhare hai
 Music side: The songs of the film have already been made into chartbusters
 'swaigar', 'move on', 'ghani baawari' ke saath-saath lagbhag 2 ghante kii is film main geet bevajab thuse gaye nahin lagate
 You can listen to the singing of Sonu Nigam without any music
 kyon dekhen:koi bhi film asal main ek kahani hoti he, jise darshak lekhak or nirdeshak kii ankhon se parde par dekhte hai
 In 'tanu Weds Manu Returns', writer Himanshu Sharma and director Anand L
 Rai have left no stone unturned
 200 fisadi manoranjan ke saath film main ek sandesh bhi he
 It is a complete family film
 kyon naa dekhen:'tanu vaids manu riterns' main aisa kuch bhi nahin he ki ise nahin dekha jaae
 It is a penny worth film in two hours

 While the national party is competing between the BJP and the Congress to connect allies
 vahiin, kshetreey dal bhi apane-apane hisaab se yani congress yaa BJP ke saath ab talmail ko antim rup de rahe hai
 If the Congress is compromising with allies or regional parties, then its compulsion is understandable, but suddenly the way the BJP is making 360 degree rotations from its old stand in important states, then it seems that BJP is now getting allies Importance is being understood
 itnaa hi nahin, bijepi ko shaayad unke bina chunaav main janaa aatmghaatee lag rahaa he
 Therefore, the BJP is once again in the posture of 'ally Sharanam Gachhami'
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki pichley ek saal ke dauraan vipakshi partiyon se bhi zyada hamalaa karne vaale shivasena supremeo uddhav thakare ne jahaan matoshri kaa daravaaza ek baar phir bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke liye kholaa
 At the same time, Amit Shah also announced to contest only two more seats in the Lok Sabha and equal number of seats in the assembly, keeping aside his political arrogance, extreme self-confidence of 2014
 yah faisla donon dalon ke liye kitna raajnneetik rup se laabhadaayak hota he ye to loksabhaa chunaav ke parinaam bataaenge
 But the equal formula, which started in Bihar last year and continues in Maharashtra, proves once again that the BJP realizes that the dream of coming back to power once again is not realized without allies can
 isliye abhi se is baat ke bhi kayaas lagaae jane lage hai ki vidhansabha chunaav main agar parinaam anukool aae to centre kii satta ke liye rajya main satta kaa taj uddhav thakare ke putr aditya thakare ko diya ja saktaa he
 However, all these speculations depend only on the results after the election
 philhal to sahyogi is baat se kush hai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah ko apane sahyogiyon kaa saath pasand he
 Therefore, a round of reconciliation and negotiation with him is also continuing
 haalanki, jaankaar kehete hai ki 2014 kaa chunaav jo ek prakaar se raashtrapati chunaav kii tarah tha, us chunaav main bhi sahyogiyon kii bhoomika ahm rahi thi
 But when the BJP crossed the majority mark, it ignored the tradition of respecting allies and the BJP dominated the question of power in the center or in the state everywhere
 kyonki uskaa maananaa tha ki jo bhi siton kii sankhya ai he wo pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kushal netritv or amit shah ke raajnneetik prabandhan kaa parinaam he
 But after losing power in 3 states last year, the BSP may have realized that Modi's magic and Amit Shah's management on the public is now getting dull
 saath hi saath congress chote se lekar bade rajyon tak main gathbandhan par jor de rahi he
 As the regional parties, in Uttar Pradesh, the SP and the BSP negotiated the seats apart from mutual coordination, the BJP was left with no other option but to go and listen to their old allies
 yahi kaaran he ki jahaan bihar main do siten jitne vaali nitish kumaar kii party janata dal united ke saath barabari ke samjhaute kaa pehle se elaan karne kaa faisle bijepi ne kiya
 The BJP also did not delay in ratifying the decision to fight on equal number of seats and based on this formula, the BJP also announced the same in Maharashtra, where the BJP will contest two seats more with Shiv Sena
 haalanki, maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main baraabar siton par chunaal ladegi
 After this, it is now believed that even in Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP is now defensive in the game of votes after the SP-BSP alliance, there is no other option than to agree with the allies
 iske alaava bhi uttar, dakshin ke rajya yaa uttar-purv ke rajyon main bhartiya janata party kii ab har sambhav koshish he ki yaa to puraane sahyogiyon ko kush rakhaa jaae yaa nae sahyogiyon ko jodakar chunaav main chalaa jaae
 In the north-east, where the Bharatiya Janata Party had predicted to do very well in the first Lok Sabha elections, there was anger among the common people as well as allies after the Citizenship Bill
 uske baad bhaajapa ne rajyasabha main bill ko pesh karne kii himmat bhi nahin dikhaai or ab bijepi ke netaa ummid kar rahe hai ki kam se kam loksabhaa chunaav tak tamaam sahyogi unke naav se kam se kam chalaang to nahin lagaayenge
 BJP leaders also believe that the 2019 election is much harder for them than in 2014
 yahaan pichley loksabhaa chunaav main congress kaa janaa tay mana ja rahaa tha or congress ke sahyogi yaa to usase apni duuri bana rahe the yaa anmane dhang se unke saath samjhauta kar chunaav lard rahe the jiske kaaran puraa chunaav ek tarah kaa america ke raashtrapati ke chunaav kii tarah ho gaya tha
 In 2014, where Narendra Modi was on one side and there was no one to challenge him on the other
 isliye us chunaav ko tab lamp post ellection mana gaya
 Where people did not even understand the need to know the name of the BJP candidate and directly pressed his finger on the lotus button in the name of Narendra Modi
 lekin is baar sthiti bhinn he
 Because many new allies or old allies are again in the electoral fray in coordination with the Congress
 bihar jaise rajya main jahaan congress kii bhoomika naganya he, vahaan rajd ke saath upendra kushvaha, mukesh sahani or jithan ram maanjhi se samjhauta kar congress ne bijepi ko ek kadi chunauti pesh kii he
 In such a situation, the BJP has hardly a choice but to hold the hands of its allies
 kyonki 2014 ke chunavi aandhi main pradhanmantri pad ke tab ke ummidavaar narendra modi samet bijepi netaaon ne loksabhaa kshetron main vaadon or ailaanon kii bauchhaar kar di thi
 But when it comes to implementing the promises, even more than 30 percent work has not started
 aise main sahyogiyon kaa saath hi bijepi ke liye kaaphi ahm he or ab bijepi ko yah baat baar-baar yaad dilaataa he ki sahyogiyon ke bina chunavi naiya paar lagaana itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 In fact, disputes in plastic bottles have been going on since 2013
 2014 main indian council of medical research yani isiemr ne bhi plastic botalon main di jane vaali dawa main khatarnaak tatv hone kii baat kahi he
 Also said that pregnant women and children should not be given these medicines
 to sawaal uthta he ki kya sarkaar plastic banane vaali companiyon ke dabaav main he kyonki packiging ke maamle main ye companiyaan pichley do saal se sarkaar ke kisi bhi prastaavit bain kaa virodh kar rahi hai

 Nitish says that if we get the responsibility, it will be fine for Rahul, but in the coming Lok Sabha elections it will be decided how much power it has
 aagaamee lok sabha chunaav ke parinaam ke bare main nitish ne apni puraani bhavishyavaanee ki pradhanmantri modi kaa koi muqaabala nahin he, us par abhi qaayam hai
 VIDEO- PM addresses students in Patna University jab bihar main mahagathbandhan tha tab nitish kumaar ke rahul gandhi se madhur sambandh rahe
 Nitish still believes that if Rahul had pressurized Lalu Yadav and given Tejashwi's resignation, he might not have needed to resign

 bihar congris ke purv adhyaksh ashok choudhary ne kaha tha jab sarkaar bachaane ke liye koi sakriy nahin hua lekin vidhayakon ko bachaane ke liye sabane koob mehnat kii
 Where there is love, there is dispute as well
 takaraar jab tak takaraar rahe tab tak to thik he lekin jab yahi takaraar ladaai-jhagade main badal jaati he to rishta bikharane kii kagaar par pahunch jaataa he
 When things are being done to degrade each other, the warmth of the relationship starts to fade
 in ladaai-jhagadon kii asli vajah hamaari lifestil he
 Our busy schedule does not let us breathe peacefully, due to which irritability increases
 chidchidapan bad jane se choti-choti baaten bhi buree lagane lagati hai
 This irritability becomes the cause of fight-fight
 pati-patni ke bich kai aisi baaten hoti hai jinaki vajah se donon main matbhed aa jate hai
 It is important that these things should be handled in time and these issues should be resolved by sitting face to face
 ye hai wo 6 baaten jinhen lekar zyaadaatar couples ke bich hoti he ladaai:1
 Before marriage, both of you liked each other's behavior and other things, but after marriage, both of you started seeing flaws in each other
 aap donon hi ek-duusare ko badalane kii naseehat dena shuru kar dete hai
 This change and talk of change gradually becomes the reason for the fight
 2
 You remember the time when there was nothing more for you than the happiness of your partner
 
 
 phir ab kya ho gaya? zyaadaatar couples shaadi ke baad ek-duusare ko mahatv dena chhod dete hai
 For them, the cost of the front matter decreases
 ye sthiti rishte ko sirf todane kaa kaam karti he
 3
 aisa kyon hota he ki jis pyaar ne aap donon ko ek-duusare se joda tha, ab aap donon ke paas usee ke liye samay nahin
 Kam is its place and relationship is its place
 kaam ke chakkar mempyar ko darkinar kar dena sahi nahin he
 4
 apni soch or apni ek nijee raay hona sahi he lekin har baar apni hi baat ko sahi maananaa or apane partner kii baat ko galat tehraakar ignor kar dena aapke rishte ko barbaad kar saktaa he
 5
 koi bhi rishta tab tak kaamyaab nahin ho saktaa he jab tak usamen donon ore se prayaas nahin kiye jaaen
 Unilateral efforts cannot take any relationship very far
 6
 If there is no trust and partnership between you then both of you need to sit down and talk
 koi bhi rishta bina vishwaas or ek-duusare kii madad ke aage nahin bad saktaa

 107 saal kii umr kaa vyakti bhi samaaj ke liye kya khatra ho saktaa he? gorakhpur ke balaanv gaanv ke chauthi yadav ke saath guuruuvaar tak aisa hi tha
 There was a Diwali-like atmosphere in Belaon village after 107-year-old Chauthi Yadav's release from Gorakhpur jail on Thursday
 bharat main sabase adhik umr ke kaidi chauthi yadav ko 38 saal puraane hatya maamle main 14 saal kii sajaa kaatane ke baad reeha kiya gaya
 The release of Chauthi Yadav was possible three months ago due to the order given by UP Governor Ram Naik
 rajyapal ne apane sanvidhanik adhikaron kaa prayog karte hue chauthi yadav kirihika aadesh diya
 For this, the then ruling Samajwadi Party government recommended on 12 January 2017
 belipaar thana kshetra ke balaanv gaanv ke rahane vaale chauthi yadav ko jail se lene 96 varshiya patni sunara or bhatija aae
 After the release, Chauthi Yadav said that he was implicated in the case innocently
 darasal, chauthi yadav ko 25 july 1979 ko hui ek hatya ke maamle main doshi paaya gaya
 The court convicted Chaudhary Yadav in 1982 and sentenced him to life imprisonment under section 302
 phir ye maamla upree adaalaton main chalaa
 In 2003, Chauthi Yadav was sent to jail
 chauthi yadav ke bete kii shaadi uuruvaa thana kshetra main hui he

 chauthi yadav kaa kahana he ki jail main unka staff or duusare kaidiyon ke saath achche sambandh ho gaye the
 According to Chauthi Yadav, when his order for release came on Thursday, everyone bid him farewell with moist eyes

 From here it means a crèche built in a Delhi court complex
 sharten choti choti hai! shaayad isliye kyonki maamla chote bacchon kaa he

 haalanki, ye kesasidhe adaalat se to nahin judaa helekin usee campus kaa he jisamen insaaf kaa mandir bhi basataa he
 But the matter is related to those who do not even know the meaning of justice
 unke mata-pita dukhi hai
 The cause of grief is a circular issued by the district court administration
 kya kahata he ye sarkari farmaan? circular main likhaa he, 'north west or north jile ke sabhinyayik afasaronor ministerial staff ke dhai saal se 12 saal kii betiyon or dhai saal se 9 saal ke beton ke liye rohinee court complex kii teesri manzil par cretch kii suvidha uplabdh he
 'if it was just this, then it is not so much
 khaas baat circular main di gayi sharten hai jo hairaan karne vaali hai
 "this facility will be provided to the children of staff only when there are no children of officers in the crèche and the children are clean, hygienic and disease free
 "staff ke bacchon ko tabhi ye suvidha milegi jab yahaan seat khaali hogi
 This will happen only when there are no children of officers in it
 yahaan tak to kisi ko koi etraj nahin hona chahie or na hi staff ke kis sadsy ko he

 Of course, the terrorists who entered Pathankot Air Force Station were killed by the soldiers, but this attack has exposed the security preparations of the country
 khaskar tab jab hamale ke bare main khufia alert ho, bachaav kii taiyaariyaan bhi kii jaaen, baavjood iske hamalaa ho jaae

 That is why 2 columns of Special Forces of the Army were deployed in the Air Force Station

 After this, he interacted with his bosses with the sp's phone in which the bosses asked why the SP was left alive
 yahi wo kol tha, jisko suraksha agenciyon ne record kiya or enese ne ucch stareey baithak bula kar alert jari kar diya
 If the terrorists were able to break through the second circle, then the damage can only be estimated

 The comments yah pehla mauka nahin he jab suraksha main chook hui ho
 This is the third major terrorist attack in the last six months, despite all the preparations, expenses and claims

 The great thing is that instead of taking responsibility for the attack, the effort is to save your neck
 punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal kaa kahana he ki aatankwaadiyon ko rokane kii zimmedaari rajya kii nahin he

 desh bhar main chal rahe dharna pradarshnon ko aap dekhenge to loktantr kii alag tasviir dikhegi
 Many times we view the demonstrations according to the opposition parties
 jo log vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai unhen in pradarshnon main janaa chahie taaki pataa chale ki vipaksh ke netaaon ke bagaiyr bhi pradarshan hote hai
 People have also stopped seeing the way of opposition
 ise is tarah se bhi dekhie ki ek zamana tha jab koi netaa banane ke liye in pradarshnon se judata tha, istemaal karata tha, magar ab wo bhi band ho gaya he
 But the demonstrations have not stopped
 zyaadaatar pradarshnon kaa nateeja bhale zero ho lekin sab agle pradarshan ke liye apni taraf se ek number chhod jate hai or yah silsilaa chalata rahata he
 After crossing such difficulties, no one can measure the intention of coming to Delhi from every corner of the country
 alag-alag rajyon se tees tees ghante kii yatra kar jab dilli aae to sab pehali baar ek duusare se mil rahe the
 Even before coming here, i saw the letter by letter, saw it by tweeting and went to court and saw when nothing happened
 sarkaar inhen divyang kahati he, bahut se divyang shabd se khush nahin hai magar isse bhi bada masalaa he ki chaahe aap inhen viklang kahen yaa divyang, usase inaki pareshaani kam nahin ho jaati he
 Otherwise, someone from the Railway Ministry would have come in between them giving assurances or giving concrete answers

 In 2018, all the handicapped who have appeared in Group d examination of Railway Recruitment Board came to the Mandi House in Delhi with their grievances where there is office of Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities
 yahaan isliye aae kyonki yahi par in chaatro ne shikaayat kii he ki railway unke sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin diya he
 The railway was supposed to keep its side here on Wednesday, but no one came from the railway side
 chaatro kaa yah samooh ayukta ke daftar ke baahar jamaa ho gaya
 Started shouting slogans insaaf maangane laga
 Nobody has come but they have not come to any trust, they have come to Delhi because of their intention
 suniye ki kahaan kahaan se aae hai or kaise kaise aae hai
 The case is that when the Railways took out the Group d result, the students who participated in the demonstration in the handicapped category passed
 riselt main unka naam tha or unase kaha gaya ki aap sabhi ke dastavezon kii jaanch hogi
 Obviously, no one will be happy to pass
 ye chaatr dacument banavaane main jute gaye
 But after a few days, the railway increases the seat in this examination
 seat badhaane ke saath ek nai category jodatii he
 Multiple Disabled
 isamen viklaangata kii 14 shreniyan badhaai jaati hai
 While filling the form there were seven categories
 jais o el, yani van leg ek paanv vaali shrenee main 95 siten thim
 In the Ahmedabad board
 vahaan ghataakar 61 kar diya gaya
 Most of the students opted for Ahmedabad board as there were 95 seats
 zaahir he jahaan zyaada siten hongi vahiin zyaada vikalp hoga
 Students will also fill more forms
 multiple disabled kii 14 shreniyan jod di gayi
 When there were 7 categories at the time of filling the form, where did the students of 14 new categories come from? jab ahmedabad board main seat ghatai gai to in chaatro ko duusare board kaa vikalp kyon nahin diya gaya
 Not only this, the board which did not have any seats for the handicapped earlier, at the time of filling the form, after the results were there, the seat has been increased and the passed students were not given the option to fill in the new board
 maan lijie kolkata board he
 If no handicap filled the form there, how did the seat increase near the result, when no one applied, the seat was increased and from where were the students brought for the increased seats
 yahi nahin viklangon se railway ne alag formet main certificate maanga jisase kaaphi pareshaani hui
 The Supreme Court orders that a certificate in any format should be accepted
 in chaatro kii ek or badi shikaayat he
 When the result was out, the cutoff from general to reserved category came out, but why did not the cutoff for the disabled come out
 ye chaatr mandi house par shaam ko bhi jame hue the
 He needs justice
 media chahie or vipaksh bhi chahie
 At least some railway official should have come and clarified the situation among them
 samvaad se behatar hi hota he
 We also get a chance to show what side of the railway is
 chaatro kaa daawa he ki viklangon ke liye ayukta ke kaarylay main railway ne apana paksh rakhana zaruri nahin samajha
 It was dated four times

 Students say another seven days has been sought from the commissioner's office
 chaatr taiyaar nahin hai
 Till late evening, he stayed at the Golmber of Mandi House

 Students say they will spend the night here

 com / 8rpid8dqiz dilli uniwarsity ke 28 collejon kaa fund rokane ke baad dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya shikshakon or chaatro ke nishane par aa gaye hai
 On Tuesday, activists of Delhi University Students' Union and ABVP burnt the effigy of Education Minister Manish Sisodia
 darasal, diu ke 28 collejon main pichley 10 maheene se koi gavarning body nahin he
 Sisodia claims that DU is deliberately delaying the formation of a governing body in these colleges
 jiske chalate college main sarkaar ke fund kaa durupyog ho rahaa he
 So Sisodia stopped the funding of these colleges alleging corruption and irregularities
 saath hi kaig se audit karaane kaa aadesh de diya
 The same order of Manish Sisodia passed away to DU students
 dilli abivipi pradesh mantri bharat khataana ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar ke is faisle kaa asar kareeb 50 hajaar chaatro par padegaa
 Not only this, hundreds of teachers and employees will also be affected by this decision of the government
 pradarshan main shaamil diu chaatrasangh adhyaksh amit tanvar ke mutabik, ''jo sarkaar chunaav ke samay 20 nae college kholane kaa vaada karti thi, wo aaj collejon kaa anudaan roak kar unhen khatm karne par tuli hui he
 According to Tanwar, it was a symbolic demonstration, but if the Delhi government did not withdraw this decision, then the movement would be fierce
 NDTF ne bhi kiya virondilli sarkaar ke is aadesh ko neshnal democratic teachers front ne bhi chaatr virdohi bataaya
 While giving a token strike outside the Art Faculty at DU, NDTF teachers shouted slogans against Sisodia and said that it is wrong to order to stop funding of colleges due to delays in administrative work
 NDTF ke adhyaksh or agxcutive council ke sadsy ajay bhaagi ke mutabik gavarning body ke gathan ke liye diu ke niyam tay hai, lekin dilli sarkaar dwaara jo naam bheje gaye wo niyamon ke mutabik nahin the
 At the same time, the university also ignored the Executive Council and proposed 5 names
 unhone bataaya ''jab ye prastaav agxcutive council kii baithak main aayaa to hamane ek cameti gathit kar jaruri suzav uniwarsity ko saunp die
 If sources are to be believed, there are many names in this list, including the disputed professor of JNU, who are not only objecting to DU teacher leaders, but also to the Executive Council members
 aapako bataa den kigavarning bodimein kul 15 sadsy hote hai jinamein se 10 sadasyon kii list dilli sarkaar bhejti he
 5 of these members are offered by DU
 5 sadsy dilli sarkaar ke taraf se prastaavit hote hai
 Of the remaining 5 members, 2 are university nominees
 2 sadsy college ke teachers or 1 sadsy college ke principal hote hai, jo gavarning body ke adhyaksh hote hai
 Significantly, out of 28 colleges of DU, only 12 colleges are given 100 per cent funds by the Delhi government
 jinamein shahid raaj guru, deen dayaal upaadhyaay, maharaja agrasen, shahid sukhdev college shaamil hai
 The remaining 16 colleges are funded by the UGC and 95 percent by the Delhi government
 dilli sarkaar se 100 fisadi fund paane vaale deen dayaal upaadhyaay college ke principal es
 K
 garg ne bataaya ki dilli sarkaar har timahi main fund release karti he
 Recently, in the month of May, the Delhi government released the fund, so at the moment, there will be no problem for the colleges by stopping the funding
 lekin agar oktober tak aglaa fund release nahin kiya gaya to phir teachers kii selary or college ke kharchon ke liye mushkilen aa sakati hai

 This benefit 0 in the second fortnight of September 2014
 35 rupee prati litre tha
 'after increasing the prices of diesel every month, now the loss on it has ended and now its price can be linked to the market
 gauratlab he ki sarkaar ne janvari 2013 main har maheene dijal mulya 50 paise prati litre badhaane kii anumati di thi
 Since then, September 2014 was the first month when diesel prices did not rise

 81 per liter has been increased
 yah shaayad pehla mauka hoga, jab desh main dijal kii khudara keemat antarrashtriya keemat se adhik he
 The loss was Rs 190 crore, the ministry said, "from October 1, 2014, oil marketing companies (omcs) will incur a daily loss of about Rs 156 crore on the sale of PDS Kerosene and LPG
 ek pakhwada pehle yah nuksaan 190 karod rupee tha

 However, when the famous lawyer and former Union Minister Sibal was asked the question, who will be the Prime Minister if the UPA gets a majority? They keep on chuckling on this
 unhone kaha ki nattejey aane ke baad gathbandhan dwaara ghoshnaa kii jaaegi
 When asked why the Congress was reluctant to declare Rahul Gandhi as its prime ministerial candidate, he said that there would have been no hesitation if the Congress had got 272 seats
 sibbal se kaha gaya ki congress abhi bhi rahul gandhi ko apane pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke taur par aage badha sakati or kah sakati he ki agar party ko bahumat miltaa he to vah pradhanmantri honge
 To this, he said, "of course if we get a majority, there is no doubt about it, but there is no question of saying it
 ham jaanate hai ki hamen bahumat nahin milegaa
 We know that we will not get 272 seats, we also know that BJP will not get more than 160 seats
 ' jab unase kaha gaya ki vah ek bada bayaan de rahe hai to unhone jawaab diya, 'kyon nahin, bilkul, hamen bahumat nahin milegaa, koi sambhaavna nahin he
 Sibal was again asked whether he wanted to say that the Congress would not get a majority? To this, he said, 'we will not get 272 seats on our own
 bahumat milane kii baat kahana mere liye morrkhtaa hogi or bhaajapa ko 160 se kam siten milengi
 With this, he said that the Congress-led UPA will get an edge in the elections and it can form the government
 haalanki, ise 'mahagathbandhan' se bhi ladanaa he
 The 'grand Alliance' is a coalition of some opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh
 yah puche jane par ki agar congress kii aguwai vaala samprag bahumat hasil karata he to pradhanmantri koun ho saktaa he? sibbal ne kaha ki yah gathbandhan dwaara tay kiya jayega
 All this will happen after the results are announced on 23 May
 yah puche jane par ki rahul gandhi ke alaava koi doosraa ho saktaa pradhanmantri he? unhone kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa, gathbandhan tay karegaa
 Coalition partners will decide on this subject
 jahaan tak congress party kaa sawaal he to rahul gandhi congress main nirvivaad netaa hai
 When questioned about the potential of the grand alliance, Sibal said that it has not been made by the Congress
 sibbal ne kaha, 'hamaara gathbandhan ekajute he
 We have an alliance with the party
 hamaare sabhi gathbandhan 2014 se pehle ke hai or barkaraar hai, chaahe yah rakanpa ho yaa dramuk
 We have added two more
 isamen karnataka main jedies va pashchim bengal main makapa he
 'on mentioning that the Samajwadi Party parted ways and aligned with the Bahujan Samaj Party
 sapa pehle congress ke saath thi
 To this, Sibal said, "it is not our fault, our coalition partners are united
 We have not left any of them, but we have added our coalition partners
" 'unhone kaha, 'lekin (basapa pramukh) mayawati ne lagaataar iskaa virodh kiya
 They divided the seats among themselves and said that we have left two seats for the Congress
 phir aise gathbandhan kaise ho saktaa he

 However, Kapil Mishra said on these things that whoever opens his mouth should not proceed by calling him an agent of BJP and Modi
 padhein aam aadmi party ke dwaara kapil mishra par kiye gayi 10 bade hamale-1
 Sanjay Singh said whether Arvind Kejriwal called Kapil Mishra and said, come and see that i am taking bribe
 sanjay singh bole ki kapil mishra bijepi kii bhashaa bol rahe hai
 Kapil Mishra should tell at what time he went to Kejriwal's house

 By the way, this discussion came to light after India's departure from World Cup

 com / ldmu9lg9il Yuvraj said that the first two formats used to be in cricket
 test or vanade
 In such a situation, being a captain of the team was an accurate thing, but now the format is three and cricket is being played a lot
 captain par aise main bahut zyada varchlod he or viraat bhi apwaad nahin he
 In such a situation, if Virat is feeling an excessive burden on himself, then someone else should try as captain in T20
 rohit bahut hi safalat captain rahe hai
 Yuvraj said that i really do not know
 yah bisisiai or selectaron ko hi tay karnaa he ki viraat kohli kitna varchlod vahan kar sakate hai
 Should they try someone else in the T20 World Cup? It depends entirely on whether they want to move forward in the future
 viraat team ke sarvshereshth ballebaaj hai
 Now how to control their workload, it completely depends on the team management, let us know that Rohit's record in the IPL as a captain has been very impressive

 ) Rajya Sabha MP and BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has spoken about RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan saying that he should be sent back to Chicago
 swami kaa kahana he ki badi hui byaaj daron ne udyog-dhandhe chaupat kar diye
 Rajan's criticism is fine, but if Swamiji's second point is that the business of the Rajan's decision has destroyed the business, then how can we justify the Finance Minister's point that India's economy is growing very fast
 ab do baton main se ek hi baat ho sakati he
 Either the business has collapsed or the economy is growing rapidly
 raajnneeti bhi diemke or eidiemke vaale vigyaapan kii tarah ho gai he
 The comments bhartiya reserve bank ke garvanar raghuram rajan ne 6, agast, 2013 ko apana pad sambhala tha
 He increased the repo rate three times as soon as he arrived
 uske baad paanch baar ghataya bhi he
 Repo rate 6 at the moment
 50 pratishat he
 Repo rate 7 when he took office
 50 pratishat thi
 The debate goes on that if Rajan had reduced the repo rate further, banks would have had more money to lend, but some say that there is very little debt from banks
 bank khud sankat ke daur se guzar rahe hai
 This is a long debate so not elaborating
 haal hi main raghuram rajan ne bhartiya arthvyavastha ko duniya main andhon main kaana raja kah diya tha
 This statement was also criticized by many ministers of the government
 baad main rajan ne afsos prakat kiya tha
 You know Rajan's term is coming to an end in September this year
 unka kaarykaal badhegaa yaa koi or aayega, ise lekar khinchataan to chalegi
 In November 2015, Swamy wrote letters to the central government with six suggestions to bring back black money
 tab swami ne kaha tha ki jo rasta vitt mantri ne apanaaya he usase kalaadhan kabhi waapas nahin aa saktaa
 Then Swamy had also said that if he is made the finance minister, he can reduce inflation in six months
 buudhvaar ko vitt mantri ne rajya sabha main subrahamanin swami kii samaj kii tarif karte hue kaha ki ve ek jane maane arthshaastri hai
 Swamy, a Rajya Sabha MP, may not need any encouragement, but he may be talking about sending Rajan to Chicago, exalted by the praise of the Finance Minister
 raghuram rajan uniwarsity of chicago main professor rah chuke hai
 Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, assumed office on August 6, 2013
 aate hi unhone teen baar repo rate main badhotaree kar di
 After that it is also subtracted five times
 is vakt repo rate 6
 50 percent
 jab unhone offis sambhala tha tab repo rate 7
 Was 50 percent
 yah bahes chalati rahati he ki rajan agar repo rate or kam kar dete to bainkon ke paas karj dene ke liye or adhik paise hote lekin kuch kaa kahana he ki bainkon se karj kaa uthaan bahut kam he
 Banks themselves are going through a period of crisis
 yah ek lambii bahes he isliye vistaar se nahin bataa rahaa
 Recently, Raghuram Rajan called the Indian economy as the Kana king among the blind in the world
 is bayaan kii sarkaar ke kai mantriyon ne aalochana bhi kii
 Rajan later expressed regret
 aap jaanate hai is saal sitambar main rajan kaa kaarykaal khatm ho rahaa he
 Their tenure will increase or someone else will come, it will be a drag
 swami ne november 2015 main centre sarkaar ko kaala dhan waapas laane ke liye chah sujhaavon vaale patr likhe the
 Then Swamy had said that black money can never come back from the path adopted by the Finance Minister
 tab swami ne yah bhi kaha tha ki agar unhen vitt mantri banaaya jaae to chah maheene main mahangaai kam kar sakate hai
 On Wednesday, the Finance Minister praised Subramanian Swamy's understanding in the Rajya Sabha and said that he is a well-known economist
 rajya sabha saansad swami ko kisi protsaahan kii zarurat to nahin magar ho saktaa he ki ve vitt mantri kii tarif se buland hokar rajan ko chicago bhejne kii baat kar baithe hon
 Raghuram Rajan has been a professor at the University of Chicago
