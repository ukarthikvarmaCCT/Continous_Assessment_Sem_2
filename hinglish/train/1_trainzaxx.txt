 Significantly, the victim's father lodged a complaint against Rajbir at the Srinivaspuri police station

 Actually, the company producing the film Raees is also a part of Farhan, that is, Farhan himself was also the producer of the film Raees
 agar wo chaahate to rais main bade aaraam se abhinay kar sakate the, magar farhaan ne rockon-2 ko chunaa, kyonki rais or rockon-2 kii shooting kaa samay takaraa rahaa tha
 The comments farhaan ne bataaya ki 'maine rais chhod di he
 i am no longer acting in Raees, as rockon-2 is shooting and Raees is shooting at the same time
 rockon-2 main meraa luk alag he or rais main alag luk
 In such a situation, we could not shoot both films at one time, so we decided to do rockon-2, because rockone is a very special film for me

 ab main rais main abhinay nahin kar rahaa hum, kyonki rockon-2 kii shooting or rais kii shooting ek hi samay par ho rahi he
 My look is different in rockon-2 and different look in Raees
 aise main ham donon filmon kii shooting ek samay par nahin kar sakate the, isliye hamane rockon-2 karne kaa faisla kiya, kyonki rockon mere liye bahut khaas film he
 There is a film very close to my heart, so i could not leave it
 ' Well, Farhan is also right, because Rockon is the film through which Farhan came to the world as an actor and singer
 lihaaja, iske sikval ko chunanaa farhaan ke liye mahatvapurn faisla he

 BJP president Nitin Gadkari said that his wearing of shirt and pants does not mean that he does not have 'ooz' like senior party leaders who wear traditional Indian attire

 On May 4, 2014, 19-year-old Ajay, a resident of Dhar, Madhya Pradesh, along with 10 indigenous men, had gone to the police in Delhi
 ye tamanchey kathith taur par rashtriya rajdhani kshetra or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke kharidaaron ko aapurti karne ke liye le jaae ja rahe the
 Alava told the police that he works for a notorious arms supplier named Tanman Singh, a resident of Barwani, Madhya Pradesh

 inamen se dinesh naam ke ek vyakti ne police ko bataaya ki vah meerut main khilaafat naam ke ek shaks ko hathiyaar aapurti karne ke liye madhya pradesh se yahaan aayaa tha
 Khilafat told the police that Dinesh had earlier supplied him with weapons, which were hidden in his farmhouse
 ye sari pistaulen madhya pradesh ke khargun, umerti or bariyaa main banaai gai thim
 Ummerti, Baria, Singnore and Khargone were places until recently unknown on the vast map of Madhya Pradesh
 desi katte banane ke liye ab tak bihar kaa munger or uttar pradesh ke muradabad, aligarh or meerut hi badnaam the, jahaan yah kaarobaar kutir udyog kaa rup le chukaa tha
 It is not so now
 pichley do varsh ke dauraan kai hathiyaar taskaron kii giraftaar ne tamaam rajyon ke police bal or kendriya suraksha agenciyon ko yah maanane ko baadhya kar diya he ki desh main gaiyrkanoonee aagneyastron kaa ek nayaa nirmaan kendrr astitv main aa chukaa he
 The business which once used to be sporadic and local and used to be used by farmers and criminals, has become a nationwide smuggling of arms due to increasing demand for small arms due to increasing crime and decreasing employment options in villages
 maang or aapurti ke is chakra main madhya pradesh ke gaanvon main bane desi katton ko ab dilli, mumbai or pune jaise shaharon ke apradhi, pashchim bengal ke maovadi or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke apradhi chote-mote aparaadhon main bhi istemaal kar rahe hai
 Arms made of Madhya Pradesh are also being recovered from these cities
 inkaa istemaal aparaadhon masalan hive par dakaiti, hatya, phiroti or lut main ho rahaa he
 The manufacturers of these pistols are mostly Sikeligar
 yah sikhon kaa lohaar samudaay he jo paramparaagat rup se chaaku, talavaarein or bandooken banane main maahir he
 Security agencies believe that there are about two to three hundred families of this community involved in this illegal business, who manufacture around 1,000 pistols every month and each cost eight to ten thousand rupees
 ke bich hoti he
 "they used to make only knives and swords, later they also made indigenous pistols," says a top police officer
 iske baavjood unki pahunch sirf sthaneey bazaaron tak simit thi or unki adhiktar pistaulen kisaan kharidte the jinhen raat main apane khet kii rakhwali kerani hoti thi
 "they also say," But in recent years they have supplied pistols to criminals and even terrorists
 ”india today ne madhya pradesh ke kuch aise hi gaanvon kaa daura kiya or paaya ki yahaan gopneey tareeke se ek aisa kaarobaar chalaaya ja rahaa he jisamen katta nirmaataaon, dallalon or aapurtikartaaon kaa ek sugathit tantra kaam kar rahaa he
 Umerti, a village of 150 families located to the south of Indore, has a sizeable population of Sikligars
 or mana jaataa he ki madhya pradesh main yah jagah avaidh hathiyaaron ke nirmaan kaa centre he
 Kalyan Singh and his two sons work on a temporary hideout atop a hill on the outskirts of Umerti where they finalize pistols, melt metal, shape it and assemble it
 kareeb 55 saal ke kalyaan pehle is kaam ke liye arms act ke tahat giraftaar ho chuke hai lekin unke mutabik, ve katta bananaa nahin chhod sakate kyonki unhen sirf yahi kaam aata he
 Umerti village is situated on the border of Maharashtra where the Aniyar river acts as a border between the two states
 sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki police jab unke thikaanon par chapa maarthi he to ve tair kar us paar maharashtra main chale jate hai or vahaan panaah le lete hai
 The police say that there is a well-established network of suppliers who run their businesses
 ye log puri tarah dopahiyaa vaahanon par nirbhar hai kyonki car yaa koi anya bada vaahan badi aasaani se pahachaanaa or jabt kiya ja saktaa he
 Finished goods are sent to Barwani in the nearby main market, where buyers, suppliers and brokers meet
 dallalon ko pahchaanana aasaan hota he kyonki ve safa baandhte hai
 One such broker named Sarvan gave India Today Rs 14,000
 main pistaul bechney kii peshkash kii thi
 But after half-an-hour bargaining, he got Rs 8,000
 main pistaul bechney ko taiyaar ho gaya
 The people here strongly oppose the police actions
 umerti ke sarpanch ramesh kumaar bataate hai ki police ke ek sipaahi kii, jo lagaataar ek sandigdh par najar rakhe hue tha, pitayee kar di gai thi
 In Baria also, the manufacture of katta has become the main occupation of the people here
 dhar ke kareeb sthit is gaanv ke log jangalon ke bheetar se kaam karte hai or apane 'kaarkaanon’ ko chalaane ke liye dijal ingine kaa istemaal karte hai
 Sudan Singh alias Baba, a Sikligar from Baria, claims that he has now stopped making pistols and is currently leading a 'normal' life
 india today se 10 minute ke samvaad ke dauraan haalanki unke paas phone par ek kol ai he or udhar se kisi hathiyaar ke bare main poocha gaya he
 In response, Sudan Singh said that no one is making illegal weapons in this village because security and police vigilance has been increased here
 baat ke ant main sudan singh ne usase poocha ki kya vah jammu-kashmir kii sarhad se kol kar rahaa he? iske baad phone cat gaya
 Sudan Singh further states that in fact the local police forces them to make kattas so that criminals can be arrested on their way
 sudan bataate hai, ''hamaare paas unki baat maanane ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin he, varanaa ve hamen salaakhon ke peeche daal denge
 "the people of Baria, who know Sudan, also deny any illegal arms trade there, although after much emphasis Gurdev Singh agreed to show us how to make a semi-automatic pistol
 gurdev ne bataaya, ''ham lohe kii pipon kaa istemaal karte hai kyonki acchhee gunvattta vaali pistaulen banane ke liye ye sabase badhibia hoti hai
 Apart from this, spring and bolt are also very easy to find
 ek hathiyaar ko taiyaar karne main kareeb ek hafte kaa vakt lag jaataa he
 Sometimes on request we write 'made in England' or 'made in China' on it
 ”khargun ke ek bichauliye dinesh chouhan ne bataaya ki kuch saal pehle tak sthaneey apradhi kiraye par hathiyaar le jate the
 He says, "you just have to make a deposit and you get a weapon for some time on rent
" kharidaar goliyon ke daam bhi de saktaa he or agar hathiyaar jas kaa tas lautaaya gaya to use jamaa raashi waapas de di jaati he
 “construction sites have the biggest hand in the success and growth of Madhya Pradesh's illegal arms industry
 jab hathiyaar taiyaar ho jate hai to unhen taskari se maharashtra ke dhule bheja jaataa he jahaan se ve nasik or phir pune pahunchaae jate hai
 Then from here these weapons are delivered to Delhi, Mumbai or wherever their demand comes from
 police ke mutabik, sirf apradhi kii vajah se inaki maang nahin badi he balki un bilderon or netaaon main bhi inaki khaasi maang he jinhen apni jaan kaa khatra he or jo licency hathiyaar nahin kharid sakate
 Such people turn to illegal weapons in Madhya Pradesh
 beshak yah dhandha kitna hi aakarshak kyon na ho, lekin iske chalate apane jivan main utaar-chadhaav jhel chuke kuch gramin kehete hai ki ab bahut ho chukaa or ve 'saamaanya’ jivan kii ore lautnaa chaahate hai
 Tapa Singh, who has recently quit making pistols, says that people do not want to leave this business even because there is a lack of employment options
 duusare logon kaa kahana he ki is dhandhe ke chalate police unke ghar kii auraton or bacchon ko pratadit karti he tathaa hathiyaaron kii taskari ke maamle main kade kanoonon ke chalate jamaanat hasil karnaa lagbhag naammumkin he
 Kamal Singh, the head of Singanor, says, "he gets imprisoned for at least six months
 ham chaahate hai ki rajya sarkaar ek kaarkaana khole jahaan ham sab ko rojgaar mil sake
 There are few people who make weapons but the entire village has to bear the brunt of it
 ” aisa kehane ke baavjood ve garv ke saath bataate hai ki unke gaanv ke ladke itane tej hai ki dur se bhi unhone kisi hathiyaar ko dekha ho to ve uski hu-ba-hu nakal banane main sakasham hai
 The Madhya Pradesh Police claims that they have destroyed this illegal industry to a large extent by attacking it, but due to the unorganized character of the business and the distance from the places it has started to reappear
 madhya pradesh ke dijipi surendra singh ne india today ko bataaya, ''jab bhi aisa maamla prakaash main aata he, ham tatkaal karrwai karte hai or isamen shaamil logon ko pakadte hai
 We have also arrested arms suppliers and manufacturers and conducted raids in the villages where they are manufactured
 ” unhone bataaya ki antarraji hathiyaar taskaron se nipatane main maharashtra ke saath samanvay ke maamle main kahin koi kami nahin he
 But the manner in which weapons made from Madhya Pradesh are being seized in every corner of the country is an indication that the police has only reached the surface of this industry
 is avaidh aagneyastra udyog ko jad se ukhaad phenkane kaa iklauta tarika yahi he ki taskaron ke khilaaf bada jaal bichaaya jaae or samasya par kendrit rahaa jaae

 chidambaram pararope he ki niyamon ko taak par rakhkar ienex media ko videshi nivesh kii manjuuri di gai or iske badale karodon rupee kii ghoose lee gai
 Actually this is the case of 2007, when p Chidambaram was the Finance Minister
 aarope he ki karti chidambaram ne apane pita ke jariye ienex media ko videshi nivesh pramotion board se videshi nivesh kii manjuuri dilaai
 INX Media received foreign investment of Rs 305 crore
 karti ne hi ienex media kii pramotor indrani mukherjee or peter mukherjee ko pi chidambaram se milwaaya tha
 In return, Karthi Chidambaram took crores of rupees as a bribe
 jabaki videshi nivesh ke liye cabinet kii aarthik maamalon kii salaahkaar samiti kii ijazat lenaa jaruri he
 In this case, the CBI had registered a case in 2017 and arrested Karthi Chidambaram
 haalanki baad main unhen zamaanat mil gai
 Then the ED registered a case of money laundering and started investigation and attached assets worth about 54 crores to Karthi Chidambaram
 is maamle main indrani mukherjee ,peter mukherjee or karti ke sie bhi aaropee hai
 However, Indrani Mukherjee has expressed her desire to become a government witness before the court
 rohit shekhar tiwari ke dephence colony ghar main katl kii raat jitne bhi log maujuud the, wo sabhi police ke radar par hai
 Police say no clean chit has been given to anyone yet

 That is, whatever the conspiracy and evidence is inside the house
 15 april, somvaar, dephence colony, dilhiuttrakhand main 12 april ko pehle charan kii voting thi
 Rohit Shekhar's vote was in Uttarakhand
 lihaaja wo apni maa ke saath vahiin gaya tha
 On the night of 15 April, Rohit returns to Delhi from Uttarakhand and comes straight to his house
 us raat rohit ke dephence colony colony vaale us ghar main rohit kii patni apurva, bada bhai siddharth sharma, naukaraani martha, naukar golu, driver akhilesh maujuud the
 Manrohit's mother, who went away after dinner, also has a government house in Tilak Lane
 wo vahaan bhi rahati hai
 On the night of 15 April, Rohit's mother Ujjwala Sharma also came to this house in the defense colony of Rohit
 lekin wo dinar karne ke baad yahaan se tilak len vaale ghar chali gai
 According to Ujjwala, when he saw Rohit that night, he was fine
 bas thodaa se nashe main lag rahaa tha
 On 15 April, Monday, 10 pm, that night Rohit's mother Ujjwala came to Rohit's house to have dinner
 rohit kii maa kii maane to tab rohit living room main nahin tha
 When he asked Rohit's wife Apoorva, he told that Rohit is tired and sleeping in his room
 haalanki kuch hi der baad rohit neeche chalaa aayaa or dinar ke baad apni maa ko unki car main bithaane ke baad phir se sone chalaa gaya
 According to Rohit's mother, on April 16, Tuesday, 4 pm, she came back the next day on April 16 at around 2 in the afternoon, Apoorva told that Rohit is not yet asleep
 iske baad ujjwala ne bhattije or endi tiwari ke purv oesady rajeev kumaar se maiks aspataal main apane anguuthe ke ilaaj ke liye doctor kaa apointment lene ke liye kaha
 Them 4
 45 baje kaa samay mil gaya
 Ujjwala went to Max Hospital with drivers Akhilesh and Rajiv
 magar abhi aspataal ke get par pahunchi hi thim ki kareeb 4
 At 30, Ramesh, a former employee of Ujjwala, received a call and told that Rohit's health has deteriorated
 ujjwala khud ambulance lekar ghar pahunchin to apurva pati ko car main lita rahi thi
 But then Rohit is taken to the hospital in the same ambulance
 jahaan doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 The post mortem report changed the story of Rohit Rohit's sudden death, but the family was shocked that everyone felt that the death was natural
 lekin teen din baad jab postmortem report ai to sari kahani palat gai
 The post-mortem report on April 19 stated that Rohit died of suffocation
 gale par nishaan bhi mili hai
 It is suspected that Rohit's face may have been pressed by the pillow
 jabaki report main maut kaa vakt raat ek se deb baje ke bich bataai gai he
 Can be even more helpful to the murderer Now if Rohit's death is due to strangulation, then the question is, how can someone be beaten up by a single, well-heeled and well-armed person? So there is also a doubt that Rohit had drunk a lot that night and was very drunk
 to nashe kii vajah se hi shaayad wo khud kaa bachaav nahin kar paaya
 Or it is also possible that there are more than one murderer

 In their last cross-examination, US attorneys Daniel J

 pakistan jab-jab bhartiya surakshabalon ke oparation se munh kii khaataa he to wo badla lene ke raste dhundne lagata he
 This time the Pakistan Army, Pakistan intelligence agency ISI and Jaish bosses have prepared a big plan to attack India again like 26 / 11, this plan is of 'marine Jihad'
 pakistan kii navy ke frog main yani paak water wing ke commando or esasji (special Service Group) ke commando milakar jaish-e-mohammad ke 50 khoonkhaar aatankiyon ko pani ke raste bharat main ghuskar badi vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke liye taiyaar kar rahaa he
 Intelligence agencies have recently decoded Pakistan's big move in this manner
 ajtak ko khufia sutron ne mili jaankaree ke mutabik paak ye sab baukhalaahat main kar rahaa he
 Sources have informed that behind this nefarious move of Pakistan, there is a big plan to target Indian Navy and Coastal Installations
 kya he paak kaa plan!-jaish e mohammad (jem) ke 'samudri jehad' kaa pardaafash ho gaya he
 He is preparing to attack India by sea route
 -jameen par bade hamale karne main naakaam rahaa jaish samudr tat ke bade shaharon or Navy Installations par hamalaa karne ke liye taiyaar kar rahaa he-sutara: pakistan ke bahawalpur main aatankiyon kii ek badi fouj ko paak navy ke 'frog main' or SSG (special sarvice group) ke commando de rahe hai training-sutron ke mutabik kareeb 50 'samudri jehadi' aatankiyon ko swimming or deep diving kii training de rahaa he jaish
 According to intelligence sources, this training is being given to the terrorists of jaish-e-mohammed under the supervision of ISI
 -sutron ke mutabik is baar pakistan kii khufia agency ISI bharat par 26 / 11 jaisaa hamalaa karne ke liye jaish ke aatankiyon ko si- root kii training dilava rahaa he
 Training of terrorists being given in Bahawalpur, Pakistan, jaish-e-mohammed has a head quarter in Bahawalpur in Punjab province of Pakistan, where maritime jihadi terrorists are being trained under the supervision of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI
 khufia sutron ne yah jaankaree di he ki 50 top samudri jehadi ko bhartee karne ke liye moulana masood ajahar or uske bhai abdul raoof ne kareeb 500 aatanki rangaruton kaa pehle chayan kiya tha, uske baad usamen se 50 ucch radiclaizatankiyon kaa brainwashkar unako swimming or diving yani pani ke andar ghota lagane kii training di ja rahi he
 Sources have said that these terrorists can damage military and navy installations by going under water for several kilometers
 report se khulaasa, jaish ab 'ground jehad' ke bajaay 'samudri jehad' ko tavajjon dene par de rahaa jorkhufia agency ke sutron ne ajtak ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik elosi or international border par bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ne aatankiyon kii naak main dam kar rakhaa he, elosi ke launch pad par is samay bhi jaish or duusare aatanki samoohon ke kareeb 300 aatanki maujuud hai lekin bhartiya suraksha balon kii chaukasee ke chalate wo bharat main ghuspaith karne main naakaamayaab hai
 Because if someone tries to infiltrate, then security forces are piling it up on the border
 is saal 11 july tak bhartiya surakshabalon ne 107 aatankiyon ko oparation ol out main dher kiya he, jisame jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankiyon kii sankhya lashkar or hijbul ke aatankiyon se zyada he
 This is the reason that Jaish has taken the path of dangerous sea jihad instead of 'ground jihad', that is, under the patronage of Pakistan, Jaish terrorists are now trying to target the coastal areas by the way of water
 paak khufia agency ab jaish par lashkar se zyada kar rahi he bharosajankaree ke mutabik pakistan kii khufia agency iesai or vahaan kii sena lashkar-e-taiyaba se zyada jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankiyon par bharosa kar rahi he
 The reason for this is that Killshkar is in the eyes of international organizations and the US and there are no specific restrictions on Jem yet
 yahi vajah he ki vah pakistan ke bahawalpur main paak navy ke 'frog main' bharat par hamalaa karne ke liye jaish ke aatankiyon kii ek toli taiyaar kar rahi he
 Let me tell you that in 2008, when 26 / 11 was attacked by Lashkar terrorists in Mumbai, at that time Pakistan had trained 10 Lashkar terrorists through its Frog Man Commandos
 is baat kaa khulaasa david colman hedli ne bhi apane kaboolname main kiya tha ki kaise mumbai main aatankiyon ko bhejne ke liye paak army ne lashkar ke 'frog main' taiyaar kiye the
 Once again, Pakistan is preparing to send its most trustworthy terrorist organization against India by sending funds and modern equipment to India through sea
 haalanki bhartiya surakshabalon ne inke is plan ko dicode kar diya he, jiske baad sabhi tateey ilaakon main alert rahane ke nirdesh die gaye hai

 bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke apane pasandida geet 
 How life is about attachment to puzzles, it seems, has made them a good puzzle connoisseur
 yah baat digar he ki is kram main ve ek nai paheli kii rachana kar daalate hai
 In fact, Gadkari convinced the untrustworthy Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and the equally unpredictable Shibu Soren on a formula he had rejected three months earlier
 aisa karke unhone ek jaadugar kii tarah jharkhandnuma topi se khargosh nikaalane kaa kaam kiya he
 With the formation of a government in the state under the leadership of bjp's Arjun Munda, the eighth government has come to power in Jharkhand in the past 10 years of history
 disambar 2009 main gathit hui maujuuda vidhansabha ke kaarykaal main yah duusari sarkaar bani he
 Apart from JMM, the Munda government has the support of All Jharkhand Students Union (5 mlas), Janata dal-united (JD-U) (2 mlas) and two Independents
 jhamumo or bhaajapa ke bich gatirodh may main us samay bana tha jab shibu sorain or unke putr hemanth ne kaha tha ki ve tabhi samarthan denge jab rajya ke mukhyamantri kaa pad munda ke badale kisi anya ko diya jaae
 Since both parties could not break this deadlock, President's rule was imposed in the state on 1 June 2010
 lagata he, yah vidhansabha bhang hone kaa bhay hi tha jisase donon partiyaan kareeb aa gayi or jhamumo chupchaap munda ke netritv vaali sarkaar main shaamil hone ko raji ho gai
 The great thing is that this coalition arrangement is nothing but a deal of salvation between two parties who have agreed to just refine their political game
 raashtrapati shashan ke teen maah ke dauraan sorain or hemanth ko ehsaas hua ki unki party main chal rahaa nirantar asantosh, jisamen vidhayakon kaa ek dhada khuleam unke varchasv ko chunauti de rahaa tha, bekaabu ho saktaa he
 His loyal mlas were also keen that the JMM chief should form a government with anyone as soon as possible to keep his court united
 sutron ke mutabik, is ehsaas ne hemanth ko gadakari ke saath nae sire se vaarta shuru karne ke liye prerit kiya
 Gadkari deployed Munda to take stock of the situation
 jhamumo duusare sthaan par rahane yani pehali baar vidhayak bane hemanth ko up-mukhyamantri kaa pad dilaane ke liye taiyaar thi
 Consequently, the cunning Munda cashed out the greed and frustration of the legislators in his own interest and formed the government
 yahaan sawaal yah paidaa hota he ki aakhir yah bandobast kab tak chalegaa? sorain pita-putr kii jodi apni mahatvakankshaon or laabh paane ke liye kukhyat he hi
 No wonder both parties have little hope of it going on
 lekin donon sarkaar banane ke liye bekaraar thim kyonki ve chaahati thim ki unki sarkaar aane se vidhayak apane vidhansabha hnetron main kuch vikaas kaaryon ko anjaam de sakenge, taaki agar madhyavadhi chunaav hote hai to unhen usamen dikhaaya ja sake
 Actually, JMM had earlier knocked on the door of Congress
 lekin uski thandi pratikriya ke baad bhaajapa ke saath saudebaaji karnaa aasaan ho gaya
 However, this process of government formation has created many differences in the BJP
 bataaya jaataa he ki party ke bujurg netaa laalkrishna adwani or kuch anya varisht netaa jharkhand ke maamle main gadakari ke akele prayaason ko lekar kathith taur par asantosh jataa rahe the
 Also, a section of the BJP leadership was against the deal as the party had had 'distasteful' experiences with the JMM in May this year
 tab jharkhand main bhaajapa samarthit sarkaar ke baavjood shibu sorain ne loksabhaa main bhaajapa hdhyojit katautee prastaav ke khilaaf matdaan kiya tha
 It was speculated that the party was divided on this, and this was proved when many top leaders of the party did not appear at Munda's swearing-in ceremony on 11 September in Ranchi
 lagata he, bhaajapa kaa kuch kadar naaraaz netritv munda kii chintaaon kii suchi ke aakhir main he
 Due to the kind of friends the Chief Minister has chosen, he hardly needs enemies
 rajya sarkaar main mantralayon kii sankhya 12 se adhik nahin ho sakati, jisase unhen vibhaagon kaa bantwaaraa is tarah se karnaa he ki jhamumo or jad (you) main takaraahat kii kam-se-kam sthitiyaan paidaa hon
 To satisfy everyone, even though Munda is not in the bus, but the circumstances of Jharkhand have increased his stature tremendously
 aakhirkaar, bhaajapa ke 42 varshiya mahasachiv ek aise raajnneetik hai jo gadakari or unke purvavarti rajnath singh main khud ko lekar is kadar bharosa paidaa karne main safal rahe ki ve unke naam kaa virodh karne waalon ko kisi bhi keemat par peeche dhakelne ke liye taiyaar the
 And then, Munda is the only tribal leader in the saffron party whom Soren is worried about
 beshak unke paas babulal marandi jaisaa karishma yaa shibu kaa bujurg sareekha rutaba nahin he, lekin ve bharose laayak netaa hai jo dosti kaa sammaan karne main drudh vishwaas rakhte hai
 He has carved a special place for himself among all the political circles in the state
 2003 ke sthanapann mukhyamantri se lekar aaj ve is pad ke liye party kii pehali or ekmaatr pasand hai
 But why does JMM not trust Munda? Munda had made a place in politics as a disciple of Soren and he became an MLA in 1995 but in 1999, he left his guru and joined the saffron party, a move that helped him gain a special place
 
 agar munda sorain ke saath hi rahe hote to unhen abhi tak mantri pad tak nahin mila hota, kyonki vah ek aisi party he jahaan parivaar ko pehle jagah di jaati he
 Ever since the two have separated, only the relationship between them is going on
 ateet main, sorain or munda ek-duusare ko mukhyamantri pad se hataane main ahm bhoomika nibhaate aae hai
 Both have achieved this top post of the state thrice, but Munda's term as chief minister is more than double that of Soren
 jhamumo ke bhaajapa ko samarthan ke baad ab kai log kah rahe hai ki donon partiyon main yah prem zyada lambey samay tak chalane vaala nahin he
 Given the inherent contradictions in it, very few people are confident that the Munda government will be able to complete its tenure with great comfort
 is bich, sorain sanchaalan samiti ke adhyaksh honge taaki yah pakkaa kiya ja sake ki gathbandhan ke sabhi sahyogi mil-julkar kaam karenge
 a post on which they will work to create a problem rather than solve it
 sorain ne sanket diya he ki ve waisi duuri nahin banaae rakhenge jaise unhone pehle kaha tha
 But those who know Guruji claim that they might let the government run this time because their son Hemant Soren, who is holding the post of Deputy Chief Minister in the government and also because he may have come to some practical understanding in some way

 What kind of partner do they want in life
 ""aaj mahilaon ko na kahana aa gaya he
 i think women should be clear in their mood that they just need to be happy
 sirf purushon ko khush rakhane kii jarurat nahin he
 i think women need to speak on their 'pleasure' in their relationship too

 Do not adopt it by saying that this is the culture of foreign countries

 "" The problem starts from our midst
 jab ham kinhin chaar mail ko party karte, drink or smoke karte dekhte hai to kehete hai ye to normal he
 But when we see four women doing the same thing then they say- o o
 mahila or purush ko lekar ye jo badale hue expressant hai, ye bahut bada fark he
 We need similar thinking here

 There are reports of violence against women in our society every day
 inamen sabase zyada maamle gharelu hinsa ke hote hai
 Violence against women is seen in these cases
 aaie vistaar se jaanate hai aakhir kya he gharelu hinsa kanoon
 What is domestic violence? Any type of violence, assault, harassment, etc
 occurring within the boundary of the house with any woman comes under this law
 yon utpeedan ke maamalon main alag kanoon he lekin use iske saath joda ja saktaa he
 Matters like taunting, abusing, insulting a woman, trying to have sexual relations with her without her consent, forcibly forcing her to marry etc
 also come under the purview of domestic violence
 patni ko naukari chhodie ke liye majaboor karnaa, yaa phir naukari karne se rokna, dahej kii maang ke liye marpet karnaa aadi bhi iske tahat aa sakate hai
 What is Domestic Violence Act? The Domestic Violence Act was enacted in 2005 and came into force in the country from 26 October 2006
 iskaa makasad gharelu rishton main hinsa jhel raheen mahilaon ko tatkaal or apatkaaleen raahat pahunchaana he
 This law protects women from domestic violence
 keval bharat main hi lagbhag 70 pratishat mahilaayein kisi na kisi rup main isaki shikaar hai
 It is the first such law in India that gives women the right to live in their own homes
 gharelu hinsa virdohi kanoon ke tahat patni yaa phir bina vivaah kisi purush ke saath rah rahi mahila marpet, yon shoshan, aarthik shoshan yaa phir apmanjanak bhashaa ke istemaal kii paristhiti main karrwai kar sakati he
 Central and State Governments are accountable This law holds the Central and State Government accountable and responsible for preventing domestic violence
 is kanoon ke anusaar mahila ke saath hui gharelu hinsa ke sakshya pramanit kiya janaa jaruri nahin hai
 The evidence presented by the woman will be considered the basis as the court believes that it is difficult to find evidence of violence inside the house
 mahila ko milti he madadgharelu hinsa se peedit koi bhi mahila adaalat main jaj ke samaksh swayan yaa vakil, seva pradaan karne vaali sanstha yaa sangrakshan adhikari kii madad se apni suraksha ke liye bachaavkaari aadesh le sakati he
 Apart from the victim woman, any neighbor, family member, institutions or with the consent of the woman herself can obtain a protective order by filing a complaint in the court of the judicial magistrate of her area
 is kanoon kaa ulanghan hone kii sthiti main jail ke saath-saath jurmaana bhi ho saktaa he
 There will be a 60-day verdict
 There is a general perception among people that the case hangs for months after going to court, but now the new law has fixed the time limit for settling the case
 ab maamle kaa faisla magistrate ko saath din ke bheetar karnaa hoga

 On Wednesday, a six-year-old little girl charmed her by handing over a check of Rs 205 to President Pratibha Patil
 yah dhan usne trainon main gaakar kamaaya tha
 The Alia cyclone that hit West Bengal last year devastated many villages, including Sarjana's village
 is tabaahi se yah bacchee itani dukhi hui ki usne raahat kaaryon main apni taraf se kuch yogadan dene kii thaan lee
 With no other means of earning money, he enlisted the help of his hobbies, singing and dancing
 is bacchee ne basirahaat or hridaipur steshnon ke bich train main chalakar aalia peediton ke liye daan ekatra kiya
 She used to sing tunes prepared by her mother on the train
 usne apane prayaason ke jariye ekatra kiye gayi dhan ko pashchim bengal ke rajyapal ko saunp diya
 When President Pratibha Patil came to know about this difficult effort, she was very impressed and called Sarjna to meet her
 is mulaakaat ke dauraan bacchee ne pradhanmantri raahat kosh ke liye raashtrapati ko 205 rupee kaa check saunpa
 He received this money for interview from AIR Kolkata
 raashtrapati ne bacchee ko uski shiksha ke liye nakad 10 hajaar rupee kaa tohfa diya
 After meeting Pratibha, Sarjna said, 'I felt very bad seeing what i saw during the cyclone (alia)
 mujhe gaanaa acha lagata he tathaa maine kai logon ke liye dhan ekatra kiya
 'he (the President) asked me to do good work
 unhone mujhe chocolate bhi di
 Sarjana's mother Swati Biswas said that the President complimented her daughter
 maine uske liye kuch gaanon kii dhune taiyaar kii thim
 She used to sing and dance to those songs and collect donations for the people
 sarjana ke pita hojri ke saamaan kaa vyapaar karte hai tathaa uski maa gruhinee he
 The Supreme Court has asked all the parties in the triple divorce case to prepare questions and give their briefs in writing to the Attorney General
 guuruuvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan kuch paksh court main vichaar ke sawaal taiyaar kar laaye the
 The central government also drafted four questions to the court
 ye prashn antim nahin hai or abhi ye dobaaraa se sabhi pakshon kii raay ke baad phir taiyaar kiye jaaenge
 All parties will make questions to the Attorney General, then compile them all to the Attorney General Court
 court 30 march ko vichaar ke mudde or sawaal tay karne par vichaar karegaa
 The bench headed by the Chief Justice indicated that the constitutional bench of 5 judges would be heard in the case
 sarkaar kii ore se ye chaar sawaal die gaye hai :1- dharmik swatantraaa ke samvidhan ke adhikaar ke tahat kya talake biddat ( ek baar main 3 talaaq kahana), halaala or bahu vivaah kii ijazat di ja sakati he?2- samanta kaa adhikaar or garima ke saath jeene kaa adhikaar or dharmik swatantraaa ke adhikaar main praathamikta kisko di jaae?3- kya personal lau ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 13 ke tahat kanoon mana jayega yaa nahin?4- kya talake biddat, nikaah halaala or bahu-vivaah un antarrashtriya kanoonon ke tahat sahi hai, jis par bharat ne bhi dastakhat kiye hai?guuruuvaar ko court ne ek yachikakarta farha faiz ko taakid bhi kii ki court main oonchi awaz main daleel na den

 darasal farha faiz court se ye kah rahi thim ki agar sirf kanoonee pahaluon ke aadhaar par hi court sunwaayee karegaa, to is maamle kaa bhi haal shahbaano cese kii tarah jayega
 To this, Chief Justice JS Khehar said that we are bound by the law
 jo bhi bahes hogi kanoon ke daayre main hogi
 You should not talk loudly in court
 khaas baat ye thi ki farha faiz hindi main bol rahi thi or mukhya nyaayadhish ne bhi hindi main hi unki daleelon kaa jawaab diya
 The Supreme Court has already said that the detailed hearing of the triple divorce case will be held from May 11

 The man of the tournament at World Cup 2011, Yuvraj could have given the team success with his bowling

 He also brought Kedar Jadhav, who changed the direction of the match against Bangladesh, after a long time

 The Pakistan team put the match in a situation where it was extremely difficult for Team India to return

 The Pakistan government will probably not challenge the bail granted to zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi, the leader of the Mumbai attacks
 ek varisht adhikari ne jamaanat radd karne ke maamle main sarkaar kii ‘apni kamajoriyon’ kaa zikr karte hue yah baat kahi, jabaki 26 / 11 maamle kii sunwaayee puri karne ke liye tay samay seemaa khatm hue ek maheene se adhik ho gaya he
 The Islamabad High Court had set a two-month deadline in April to conclude the Mumbai attack case while disposing of a government petition filed to revoke Lakhvi's bail
 ucch nyaayalay ne bhi ghoshnaa kii thi ki yadi nichali adaalat do maheene main or madhya june tak maamle ko sampann karne main naakaam rahati he to vah lakhvi kii jamaanat radd kar degaa
 Although a month and a half has passed since the deadline set by the High Court, the government has not officially said anything about Lakhvi's bail challenge again
 ek varisht sarkari adhikari ne bataaya ki sarkaar dwaara lakhvi kii jamaanat ko dobaaraa chunauti dene kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Originally, the High Court, while disposing of the government's plea, also said that if the defense (lakhvi) lawyers are found to be responsible for the delay in the case, the court can cancel their bail but the ground situation is completely different
 tippaniyan He said that the delay in the case was done on behalf of some members of the prosecution whom the government gives a considerable amount to appear in every hearing
 unhone kaha, ‘ucch nyaayalay kii do maheene kii samay seemaa ke guzar jane ke baad sarkaar lakhvi kii jamaanat ko dobaaraa kaise chunauti de sakati he, jab iske apane hi kuch abhiyojak maamle main der ke liye jimmedaar hai

 a senior government official said the government is unlikely to challenge Lakhvi's bail again

 The comments unhone kaha ki maamle main der abhiyojan paksh ke kuch sadasyon kii ore se kii gai jinhen sarkaar har sunwaayee main pesh hone ke liye acchhee khaasi rakam detii he
 He said, "how can the government challenge Lakhvi's bail again after the High Court has passed the two-month deadline, when some of its own prosecutors are responsible for delay in the case

 Read what it accepted in the exclusive conversation: 1
 maine kitne bacchon ko maaraa, thik se yaad nahin
 Killing 30 to 35 children and doing wrong with them
 jaise-jaise ginati yaad aati jaaegi main bataata jaaoongaa
 i have done crime chupaane se koi phayda nahin he
 2
 (khud ko insaan maanate ho? is sawaal par) nahin, main khud ko insaan nahin maanata
 Because i have done so many wrong things
 3
 Had heard about Nithari scandal
 wo bacchon ko markar unhen kha letaa tha
 It felt strange to hear
 4
 It worked for the first time in 2008
 tab maine skool choda hi tha
 i was an alcoholic and intoxicated with fluid
 uske baad meraa dimag block ho jaataa tha
 Then at night i used to go for a walk
 jhuggiyon ke baahar yaa road se, bacchon ko uthaa letaa tha
 Used to take them away to the fields and did wrong
 5
 When the children screamed, they would do wrong by killing them
 main jaanata tha ki bacchon ke saath jo kar rahaa hum, galat hum
 But the cry and cry of the children had no effect on me
 6
 He jumped the wall of small houses and opened the latch from inside
 phir sote hue bacchon ko uthaakar le jaataa tha
 i used to do this work except two-three months
 2014 main ek cese main mere do dost mere saath the
 i did all the other incidents alone
 mere ghar waalon ko pataa lagegaa to sochenge ki main yaa to mar jaataa yaa paidaa hi nahin hota
 7
 mauka miltaa to apano ke bacchon ke saath bhi yahi karata
 i worked with children in Mazri village, Kanjawala, Ghevra Mor near Mundka, Noida, Jain Nagar, near Bhalaswa Dairy, near Narela, near my aunt, my maternal uncle, aunt's aunt, in my village, Faridabad
 8
 Used to misbehave with children ranging from two-and-three years to 12-13 years
 jo baccha mil gaya usee ke saath karata tha
 Used to work in a deserted place
 9
 When i used to do this, my mind was completely separated from my intoxication
 maine ek-do film dekhi thi, jinamein bacchon ke saath aisa hi kiya jaataa tha
 Children were mistaken for killing them in the film
 isliye main bhi aisa karata tha
 10
 jin bacchon ke saath galat kaam kiya, unki shakl yaad he
 But don't remember according to the area
 kyonki kai jagah pehle jhuggiyaan thim
 Now houses have been built there
 jo kuch maine kiya uski sajaa maut honi chahie
 i should be hanged

 Jailed RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav's second son-in-law has come under target of the Directorate of Promotion
 pravartan nideshaalay ne rahul yadav ko notice jari kar poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa he
 Rahul Yadav is accused of giving Rs 1 crore as loan to his mother-in-law Rabri Devi
 isi mudde ko lekar jadyu ne kaha he ki lalu parivaar puri bhrashtachar kaa gang ban chukaa he
 The party has said that the wires of corruption in the Laloo family are going on connecting with each other
 party pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki lalu prasad yadav ne bhrashtachar karke apane parivaar ke sabhi vyaktiyon ko fansaa diya jo kabhi nirdosh hua karte the
 Lashing out at Lalu, Sanjay Singh said that the RJD supremo acted like a zamindar, on whom the government applied pressure, he gave his land to the servants and thought that everything was done
 jadyu pravaktaa ne kaha ki lalu kii haalat shuturamurg kii tarah ho gai he, jise lagata he ki usne apana sar jameen ke andar kar liya he to khatra tal gaya he
 Sanjay Singh said that Lalu first implicated his wife, then daughter, then son and now his son-in-law too, because now Lalu's son-in-law has also hit the target of Income Tax Department and Enforcement Directorate
 jadyu pravaktaa ne kaha ki lalu parivaar ke liye vahi baat he ki jaisi kerani waisi bharani
 Hitting out at former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, Sanjay Singh said that he does not know why the Lalu family does so much for wealth? Sanjay Singh said that Lalu used to say that he is the leader of the poor, but today he has collected so much money that there is no one in Bihar bigger than him
 jadyu ne kaha ki lalu yadav mafiaon ke netaa ban gaye, kyonki yahi mafia bihar ke garibon ko lootakar lalu kaa daaman bharte hai
 JDU said that the mafia has filled all the members of the Lalu family with money, the result of which is that no one of the Lalu family is less than a billionaire to this day
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki lalu parivaar shaayad yah bhul gaya he ki kafan main jeb nahin hota he
 Taking a dig at Tejashwi's educational qualifications, Sanjay Singh said that millions of talented youths of the country are keen to research the subject, how did Tejashwi Yadav become the owner of such a vast property without such educational qualification? The JDU spokesperson told Tejashwi Yadav that he should give some tips to the youth of today, as they have to struggle for the job despite having qualifications
 jadyu ne kaha ki 28 saal kii choti si umr main hajaaron karod ke maalik bane tejasvi yadav ko desh ke management sansthaanon main class lenaa chahie or bataanaa chahie ki kaise bina mehnat or bina koi dhandha kiye akut sampatti banaai ja sakati he

 It is worth noting that the Central Government has issued orders to all the states to investigate the Maggi
 anil vijane kaha, 'puure desh main maamla uthaa hua he
 Lead has been found in Maggie's investigation
 maine apane swasthya nideshak ko kaha he ki sabhi jilon main jaanch karwaai jaae

 Pradeep Singh says that his work is at a standstill
 ek samay 12 ghante factory main kaam hota tha, magar aaj sirf 8 ghante hi kaam ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, when we are not able to earn, then where should we give money to the laborers
 ' pradeep singh kii oil filter banane kii factory he, jahaan 30 majdoor kaam karte the, magar ab sirf 15 majdoor hi kaam kar rahe hai
 Pradeep said that many workers have now returned to their homes due to lack of work

 What is pressure What is the rule of pressure in liquids? What is the effect of pressure on melting and boiling points
 jaanane ke liye padhate hai daab
 Pressure (pessure): The force exerted on the unit area of a surface is called the pressure ie Kidab (P) = f / a = force perpendicular to the surface / area of the surface pressure
 I
 The unit is n / m ^ 2, also known as Pascal (pa)
 daab ek adish raashi he
 Atmospheric pressure: Normally atmospheric pressure is the pressure, which is 76 cm of mercury
 lambey kollam ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 S
 of atmospheric pressure I
 The unit is a bar
 1 baar = 10^5 n / m^2vayumandaleey daab 10^5 newton / meter^2 yani ki ek baar ke baraabar hota he
 Atmospheric pressure decreases as it rises above the surface of the Earth, causing (i) difficulty in cooking on the mountains
 (ii)vayuyan main baithe yatri ke fountain pen se syaahi ris jaati he
 Atmospheric pressure is measured with a barometer
 isaki sahaayta se mausam sambandhi purvanumaan bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 When the reading of a barometer falls suddenly, there is a possibility of thunderstorm
 barometer kaa paathyank jab dhire-dhire neeche girtaa he, to varsha hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 When the barometer reads slowly up and down, the day is likely to be clear
 drav main daab (pressure in liquid):drav ke anuon ke dwaara bartan kii diwaar athwa tali ke prati ekank kshetrafal par lagane vaale bal ko drav kaa daab kehete hai
 The pressure due to the fluid at a point inside the fluid from the surface of the fluid is equal to the depth (h) of that point by the density of the fluid (d) and the product of gravitational acceleration (g)
 yani ki p(daab) = h x d x gxravyom main daab ke niyam:(i)sthir drav main ek hi kshaitij tal main sthit sabhi binduon par daab samaan hota he
 (ii) The pressure at a point within the stationary fluid is equal in every direction
 (iii)drav ke bheetar kisi bindu par daab swatantra tal se bindu kii gaharaai ke anukramanupati hota he
 (iv) The pressure of a fluid at a point depends on the density of the fluid
 ghanatv adhik hone par daab bhi adhik hota he
 Laws of pressure in liquids: The first statement of Pascal's law: - If the gravitational effect is considered negligible, the pressure at each point inside the fluid is equal in the state of equilibrium
 pascal ke niyam kaa dwitiya kathan:-kisi bartan main band drav ke kisi bhaag par aropit bal, drav dwaara sabhi dishaao main samaan pariman main sancharit kar diya jaataa he
 Some instruments based on Pascal's law are: hydraulic lift, hydraulic press, hydraulic brake etc
 drav kaa daab us paatr ke aakaar yaa aakriti par nirbhar nahin karata jisamen drav rakhaa jaataa he
 Effect of pressure on melting point and boiling point: The effect on melting point: (i) The substances whose volume increases on heating, their melting point also increases when pressure is increased: like- wax, Ghee etc
 (ii)garm karne par jin padaarthon kaa aaytan ghat jaataa he, daab badhaane par unka galnaank bhi kam ho jaataa he: jaise- barfkvathanank par prabhaav:sabhi dravon kaa kvathanank badhaane par daab bad jaataa he

 Don Bradman's name is the highest score on the Lord's ground during the Ashes series
 varsh 1930 main kheli gai series ke dauraan sar breadman ne 254 ranon kii pari kheli thi, jise vah khud bhi apane kariyar kii behtareen pari mana karte the
 It is the dream of every batsman in the world to score a century on the 'mecca of Cricket' Lords, and England's Michael Arthurton also got the same dream in his eyes in the 1993 series, but was run out on a personal score of 99
 iske baad arthurton aath saal tak cricket khelte rahe, lekin apane hi desh ke is maidan par shatak banane kaa sapana puraa nahin kar sake
 Like the batsmen, the bowlers are also desperate to show amazing on Lord's pitch

 The credit for this victory goes to the then English captain Andrew Strauss, who scored 161 runs in the first innings of the match and ultimately laid the foundation for England's 115-run win

On this Hansraj Hans said that 'I do not know that the pieces were broken, i was a very small child at that time
 mujhe is bare main zyada nahin pataa
 On this, the anchor told the whole thing that in 1971, Pakistan had made two pieces of Hindustan, and one piece had become Bangladesh and PM was Indira Gandhi at that time

 mumbai kii local ke liye railmantri ne ek baar phir yojanaon kaa pitara kholaa he lekin kendra sarkaar main unke hi sahyogi ne is pitare par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Amidst all this the death toll on the local train lines kept rising alarmingly throughout the week
 gat 15 agast se 20 agast tak local trainon se hue haadason main 60 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 On Monday, during the railway program in Mumbai, Minister of State for Social Justice Ramdas Athawale sat asking when AC Local will run, but Prabhu may not even have the answer to the question of his associate minister in the Union Cabinet
 chah maheene se asi local karshed main padi he
 Train doors, AC, motors not working
 isaki oonchai bhi iske sanchaalan main aade aa rahi he
 However, despite the comfort of crores of this train, the Railway Minister gave a glimpse of the sky like Danadan Footover Bridge, escalator, wi-fi
 yah bhuulakar ki do saal pehle kiye gaye, dabl-dekar train, alivited corndor jaisi kai yojanaayen adhuri hai
 Moreover, cab signaling that improves the frequency of trains has also been shown to be a red signal
 tippaniyan The Mumbai suburban system currently works on the fix block
 yani ek trek par chal rahi do trainon main khaas antar rakhaa jaataa he
 These blocks are called signaling regions
 vahiin emutipi main shaamil kiye gaye cab signling se motorman ko cabin main hi train kii lokation, gati or do trainon kii duuri kii jaankaree mil jaati
 This would increase the continuity of trains, reduce congestion and perhaps remove the tag of the murderer on the local
 lekin philhal is mudde par mantriji siyasat-siyasat khel rahe hai
 He said that this work should have been done 15-20 years ago, but not done
 ab isamen vakt to lagegaa
 Mumbai's local needs first safety
 roj ausatan nau logon kii maut kaa sabab banane vaali upnagareey rail seva main har saal lagbhag 3500 logon kii maut hoti he
 Yet the government's priority is wi-fi, not security
 mumbai saurban system philhal fiks block par kaam karata he
 That is, a special difference is maintained between two trains running on a track
 in blox ko signling kshetra kaha jaataa he
 At the same time, the cab signaling included in the MUTP would give the motormen information about the location, speed and distance of the two trains in the cabin itself
 isse trainon kii nirantarata badhati, bheed kam hoti or shaayad local par laga kaatil kaa tag hatataa
 But the minister is currently playing politics on this issue
 unhone kaha yah kaam 15-20 saal pehle ho jane chahie the, lekin nahin hue
 Now it will take time
 mumbai kii local kii pehali jarurat he suraksha
 About 3500 people die every year in the suburban train service, which accounts for an average of nine deaths every day
 phir bhi lagata sarkaar kii praathamikta vaai-faai he suraksha nahin

 Nitish has said that the complete liquor ban law will come into force in Bihar from April 1, 2016
 patna main yojit ek kaarykram main hissaa lene pahunchesiem nitish kumaarane kaha ki sarkaar agenda taiyaar kar rahi he, jis par amal karte hue rajya ko sharaab se mukt kiya jayega
 He said, 'the new generation cannot be left to waste under the pretext of revenue
 phayda-nuksaan vyapaar main hota he, sharaab main nahin
 'in a jolt, the election was done in fact, in the last years under Nitish's rule, there was a lot of crime in the state, due to which he also had to face criticism
 rajya main jab dobaaraa chunaav kaa dangal shuru hua to nitish ne daanv khelaa or bihar main sharaab bandi lagu karne kaa vaada kiya
 Soon after winning the election and assuming power, Nitish will have a profound impact on the population
 unhone kaha ki is maamle se jude sabhi pakshon ke saath milakar sarkaar pehle charchaa karegi phir niyam lagu karegi
 Nitish made this announcement when during an event in Patna, some women raised the issue of alcohol and demanded a ban on it
 jiske baad mukhyamantri ne khud iskaa aashwaasan diya tha
 Nitish Nitish Kumar was silent on the first liquor ban, but a few years ago he had a different opinion on this issue
 nitish ne kuch samay pehle hi kaha tha ki jinhen pinaa he wo tex dekar pite rahen, tex kaa paisa sarkari khajaane main aayega tabhi janhit kii yojanaayen shuru ho sakengi or vikaas hoga
 Not only this, he said that drinkers find their way

 The government has taken several steps and policies in the past regarding illegal liquor sales

 Also, in 2014-15, about three thousand crore rupees reached the state government's fund

 The government has tried to crack down on the sale of illicit liquor in the past, but could not achieve complete success

 Earlier, RJD also raised questions

 What is the Himalayan connection? Tell us that there is one aspect of Narendra Modi's life that people do not know much about

 bharat kii vaapasiy, da wal street jarnal main yah ghoshnaa tab kii gai thi, jab yah jaahir ho gaya tha ki bharat ke votaron ne narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi ko loksabhaa main bahumat de diya he
 It reminded the headlines of the days of "incredible India" as well as the comparison of India with China during the latter years of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government and Manmohan Singh's first term
 chunaav nateezon kii ghoshnaa hone ke baad america main is bare main charchaa hone lagi ki modi kaise netaa hai, kisi sarkaar banegi or vah sarkaar kis tarah ke bharat kaa netritv karegi
 Like India, there was a mixture of curiosity, hope and concern in these discussions in executives, businessmen, experts and media
 april main kamedian jon oliver ne bharat ke chunaav ko puri tarah cover na karne ke liye america media kii bhartsana kii thi, phir bhi is baar america media kii dilchaspee pehle se kahin zyada thi
 Elections were also widely discussed in editorials and articles in American newspapers and in news and comedy shows
 chunaav nattejey, modi sahit nami hastiyon kii upasthiti, america style main prachaar, sahaj uplabdh soochna, badi sankhya main america samvaadadaataaon kii bharat main maujuudagi or soshal media ne milakar pehle se kahin adhik kawarej karai
 The unprecedented victory of the BJP, especially in the result, caught the attention of the people
 media main sabase prabal bhav pradhanmantri modi ke bare main jigyaasa ko lekar rahaa he
 There has been much discussion about them, but the information is very less
 sawaal sirf yaheen tak simit nahin he ki modi acchhee vruddhi or sushasan ke apane vaade puure kar paaenge yaa nahin, balki log yah bhi jaananaa chaahate hai ki ve kaise pradhanmantri honge, matlab, vyaavhaarik, sudhaarak yaa ati rashtravaadi bahubali honge, sahansheel yaa ashishnu honge, america ko andeh kii drushti se dekhenge yaa america ke vyaavhaarik saajheedaar honge?kaarobaar jagat kaa bhav kaaphi had tak ummiido bharaa he
 The majority received by BJP has reinforced this sentiment as it is expected that the new government will be stable and will give definite direction in terms of policy
 ummid yah bhi he ki kaarobaar kaa maahaul sudharega or sarkaar aarthik sudhaaron par jor degi, jisase soi hui bhartiya arthvyavastha harakat main aegi
 People are also thinking that even if the relations between the two governments do not get heated, Modi will not affect the American companies
 haalanki is baat ko lekar chintaa bhi he ki sarkaar shaayad apekshaaon par khari na utar sake
 Questions are also being raised as to whether Modi will prove to be as effective on the economic front at the Center as he was in Gujarat, will some politics and bureaucratic obstacles prove invincible, and will India be able to show its potential? The business world has closely monitored the formation of the Council of Ministers and will also keep an eye on the initial steps and the policy signals in the upcoming budget
 america adhikariyon ke liye bhi ashanka or chintaa kii vajahen hai
 In the last few months, some critics in India have again raised the flag that the US does not respect India and wants to stop it from standing
 lekin asal main america main adhiktar log bharat ko kaamyaab hote dekhnaa chaahate hai or obama sarkaar ne yah kehane se munh nahin churaayaa he
 He has clearly stated that the United States believes that the rise of India as a whole is "for America's interests
" 
 
 antarrashtriya vyavastha ke liye
 
 
 Good for the world economy
 ’’ is baat ko bhi samajha ja rahaa he ki bharat or america hameshaa sahamat nahin honge
 Yet it is being said again and again that whatever happens, the US will support the rise of India and all parties are unanimous
 isliye america sarkaar ek, ‘‘shashakt, viksit or samaveshi bharat ko dekhnaa chaahegi jo vishwa samudaay ke saath khulkar miltaa-julata he’’ or narendra modi ne iskaa vaada kiya he
 Questions and concerns exist about what will be the effect of America's limited official contact with Modi while in office
 raashtrapati obama, videsh mantri jon kerri or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar sujan rice ne turat-phurat elaan kar diya ki america donon loktantron ke bich majboot saajhedaari viksit karte rahane ke liye nai sarkaar ke saath kaam karne ko utsuk he
 Both government officials and outside experts see Modi's early signs of being favorable to America
 modi ne haal hi main ‘‘swaabhaavik sahyogi’’ shabdon kaa istemaal kiya he or jor diya he ki aapasi sambandh donon deshon ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 The US will also not mind that India develops better relations with many of its allies and adopts a policy of more solid relations with the eastern countries
 usne dakshin asian netaaon, khaskar pakistan ke pradhanmantri ko shapath grahan samaaroh main bulaae jane ko shubh sanket kaha he
 Yet there are some people in the US government and parliament who are worried about Modi's image on communal issues
 is tathy ko na to andekha karnaa chahie or na hi bahut zyada mahatv dena chahie
 Modi's critics will remain active in the US power establishment, but the support he receives seems to be waning
 apekshaaon ke jowar ko lekar bhi mote taur par chintaaen hai
 Some reviewers have tried to compare how President Obama came to power in the 2008 election with high expectations of "we can" and promises of change, but those promises were not fulfilled
 iske baavjood ummid kii ja rahi he ki modi sarkaar aarthik uddeshyon, sushasan, samaveshi or sthir sarkaar ke vaade puure karegi or bharat yakeenan vaapasi karegaa
 Modi has said that the mandate is met with this objective
 (lekhika washington disi main brookings institutions main da india project kii diarector or fahrren policy program main phelo hai) At least 14 flats and houses, a dal mill, a room filled with 60 kg of silverware, one kilogram of gold, and 20 lakh cash

 or shrimoyi ne 2014-15 main hi ek rangakarmi ke jivan par likhe ja rahe upanyaas kii pandulipi saajha kii thi
 Then i told him about the life of Karant ji
 theatre main meraa aana bhi unheen ke saath judaa hua tha
 He was a living legend
 unako maine kerala main or rangayan (mysuru) main dekha
 In Chhupan, the news of the famous vibha-karanth incident in Bharat Bhavan was also read on the front page
 phir enesdy main padhaate vakt guest house main rahete hue unheen ke saath morning walk par jaataa
 He used to say, "he did so much, but not the children, who carried it forward, but it was probably not good to be able to do so much for the theater
" " to ye chijen dimag main thim
 But felt that if i do something on Karanji now, as in the political atmosphere today, i do not know what will be interpreted
 chaatro ke saath naatak karne kii baat aane par sochaa ki is upanyaas ke jariye karant ji se judi baton ko third person main kaha ja saktaa he
 Question- Blindside has the story of a very volatile life of a prominent painter
 isamen aapke tamaam prayogon ke baavjood katha kaa bhaavnaatmak sutara darshak kii pakad main bana rahata he
 So has Abhilash Pillai got a style of his own? i don't know, but yes, i am trying
 koshish yah bhi hogi ki meri koi style ban gai he to use bhi todun
 As soon as the style is formed, you become safe in a way, enter into a zone
 par great artist us style ko bahut aage le gaye hai
 Question- How much, how did Karant influence on the creative level? Karant ji also composed music with stone and clay
 har cheez main creativity dekhte the
 They used to say, theater has no boundaries
 jo bhi nayaa aae, le lo or use apni paribhaasha main dhaal lo
 For us like him, that idea was like a window
 ve total theatre main yakeen karte the, har kisi ko sab kuch siikhnaa he, abhinay, sangeet, dizin sab
 Some of our teachers used to say that (ibrahim) had a style of Alkaji, Karant ji came and did everything
 mujhe karant ji kii style bhaati thi
 Question- In this drama, do you consider the story to be broadly understood or your failure? mujhe andhere main ghuskar har dam kuch dhundhna acha lagata he
 This is what a scientist does, so why not an artist! We asked the students in class to keep the mobile full charged and on
 yah unke liye bhi ek jhatka tha
 Sending a piece, students would open it with a QR code
 puri kahani kaa unhen bilkul pataa na tha
 All the improvisation was done on mobile for 20 days, on which these stories came openly
 phir bade screen par laae or phir acting main ghuse
 So many times the experiments fail but the attempt is to find the genuin
 sawaal- bahut-se rangakarmi / chaatr aapke shikshak ko aapke nirdeshak par ahmiyat dete hai
 i have been teaching for almost 20 years
 padhaate vakt production nahin, prakriya ahm hoti he
 Some of the students were very disturbed, did not enter the class, were psychiatrists of psychiatrists
 to unhen samajhnaa, laana, unke hisaab se seen bananaa taaki ve bhi khul paaen
 a mentally disturbed student was tired of meeting the doctor, then kept him in the role of a doctor, then a therapy (as it happened)
 hamen dekhnaa hota he ki students ke liye kya acha he
 Question - Your reading about audience, what is your understanding? Audience has many challenges ahead
 use popular bollywood or regular theatre vaali chijen to mil hi rahi hai
 i think if the audience comes, the drama should be a little challenging for him, he got to think something
 ek aisi jabaan jo unako force kare
 i try to push the audience a little bit
 main chaatro se kahata hum, hamaara arth spasht ho, research pakkaa ho
 Audiences are very intelligent
 ham apane kiye par vishwaas karenge to sambhav he, usko aage kii chijen bhi samaj aa jaaen
 But the attempt is that we do not simplify the audience so much
 sawaal-pandrah saal pehle babarnama par aapke prayog kii khaasi aalochana hui thi
 He was called till Babur Chyawanprash
 aaj uske bare main sochate hai to kya pate hai?yahaan ham uskaa acha sho nahin kar paae the par japan main acha hua tha
 That experiment was necessary to gain the confidence to bring technology to and from theater on this scale
 ab samaj main aa rahaa he ki technology kii energy, maikenical energy or human energy kya hoti he
 On the question, your plays are very expensive
 paisa mujhe nahin par haa, technology or setap ke liye to chahie
 There is an expense, but such efforts are necessary in this country
 aakhir mobile theatre or jatra vagairah main to aise prayog hote hi hai naa!*** China has extended the duration of the Orange Alert issued for three days in the event of heavy air pollution in the new year, as Beijing continues to lash toxic fog
