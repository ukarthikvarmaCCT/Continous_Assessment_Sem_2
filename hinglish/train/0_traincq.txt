 In this season, pouring is required, but no one is getting it
 
 
 ' At the same time, the farmers got angry when they found urea even after standing in line for hours in Sirsa, Haryana

 Some farmers are buying more in haste, some are being blacklisted
 
 
 hamane red bhi daali hai
 
 
 ' udhar, haryana sarkaar to shikaayat karne kii himmat bhi nahin juta saki
 Agriculture Minister OP Dhankhar said, 'I say on the injury of Danke that 70,000 metric tonnes of Hooda has come more than the government this year

 loksabhaa chunaav (general Elections Results 2019) main bihar main bijepi (BJP) or jediu (JDU) ne milakar kul 40 siton main se 39 par jeet hasil kii he
 The RJD and Congress (congress) alliance could win only one seat
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke parinaam aane ke baad guuruuvaar raat ko bihar (bihar) ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) kii neend unke raajnneetik jivan kii sabase sukhad or aaramdaayak neend hogi
 There are many reasons for this
 1
 Among these results, the most enjoyable feeling for Nitish Kumar would be that he managed to get his political rivals RJD and Lalu Yadav and his family out for a zero in the election
 haalanki nitish kumaar ve shaks hai jinhone 2014 ke chunaav main apni party kii karaari haar ke baavjood rajd adhyaksh lalu yadav ko phone karke misa bharti or rabari devi kii haar par santvanaa di thi
 2
 argedy se rishte main kadavaahat or pichley saal arriya loksabhaa or jahanabad vidhansabha ke upachunaav main haar ke baad nishchit rup se na keval rajd balki unke saath jeethanram maanjhi, upendra kushvaha or mukesh nishad kii karaari haar ke baad nitish (nitish Kumar) na keval brihaspativaar ko kush dikhe balki unhen is baat kaa santosh dikhaa ki unke netritv vaale endie ke kilaaf filhal koi gathbandhan yaa sameekaran janata ke saamne kaam nahin kar rahaa
 3
 is baar ke chunaav parinaam se ek baar phir sabit hua ki agar kisi baraat ko bihar main raajnneetik jeet tay kerani he to duulhe ke rup main nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ko rakhana hoga
 This was accepted by BJP national president Amit Shah during a dinner hosted in Patna
 tab patna ke patrakaron ne nitish ko satraa seat die jane par shikaayat ke lahaze main kaha tha ki bhaajapa ko adhik siton par ladanaa chahie tha
 Then he said that Nitish Kumar cannot be offended or ignored in the percentage of votes
 4
 It was clear from the election result that the candidates of one NDA got votes of every caste and class which became easy due to the face of Narendra Modi and the association of Nitish Kumar
 zamin par log kuch bhi shikayaton main media waalon ke saamne kahen lekin modi ke nitish ke saath aane ke kaaran voton ke maamle main rujhaan endie umidvaaron kii taraf tha
 5
 chunaav parinaam main ek seat jo kishanganj haare vah nitish (nitish Kumar) ke liye sabase adhik santosh kaa kaaran rahaa
 Just as most of the NDA candidates were not aware of such a huge margin of victory, Nitish was also unlikely to get more than three lakh votes of the Janata Dal candidate in Kishanganj
 lekin in voton se nitish ko ab bharosa ho gaya he ki vidhansabha chunaav main muslim matadaataaon kaa ek prabhavi tabaqa unke gathbandhan ko unke naam par vot karegaa
 6
 chunaav parinaam se nitish (nitish Kumar) ke sahyogi or virdohi donon ek baat par sahamat dikhe ki ati pichhadi jatiyon or mahadalit samudaay par abhi bhi nitish kaa sikaa chal rahaa he
 Both these vote banks were built by Nitish during his rule and still he has faith in Nitish more than any other party
 7
 Although after the election result Nitish Kumar believed that caste is a factor but he also believed that the work will be recognized by the public, which is proved by the result
 nitish ke anusaar mahatv kaam kaa hi he
 According to him, the others who tried to divide the society failed
 kaam karne vaali jamaat ko janata ne samarthan diya he
 Those who were trying to analyze by adding caste are now understanding
 8
 The era of caste-based politics is over now
 yah nitish (nitish Kumar) ke liye sabase sukhad baat he kyonki unke simit vot bank ke bare main ab tak sawaal uthte rahe the
 9
 is chunaav ke parinaam se nitish (nitish Kumar) isliye bhi kush honge ki ab agle saal vidhansabha chunaav main rajd-congress gathbandhan se unhen koi raajnneetik chunauti nahin he
 Anyway the vote gap is more than twenty percent which needs a political miracle to reverse
 10
 The most satisfying thing for Nitish (nitish Kumar) was that the result of this Lok Sabha was that Tejashwi Yadav is no longer a boon for him, but a boon, as long as Nitish will comfortably rule the throne of Bihar

 Puducherry Election Results 2019 comments: Check your Lok Sabha constituency election results here aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat 11 aktubar ko upi ke gorakhpur main the
 Just a day before voting for the first phase of Bihar election, a senior BJP sitting in a very worried posture asked the reason in courtesy
 unka jawaab tha, ''mere aarakshan sambandhi bayaan kaa galat arth nikaala gaya
 "the leader nodded," the wrong message has gone down to Bihar and there is a lot of backlash
 ''lekin sangh kii chintaa us vakt or bad gai jab diwaali se thik pehle aae bihar ke chunaav nateezon main bijepi ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa or hukmdev narayan yadav, ashvini choube or shanta kumaar jaise party saansadon ne bam phod diya
 These people termed Bhagwat's statement as a major reason for defeat
 yah ek aisa bam tha jisase modi raaj ke 15 maheenon main pehali baar asahmati ke sur dhamaake ke rup main sunai pade
 But the bjp's problem grew when members of the guide board and senior most leaders of the party, LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, former Union Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha and Shanta Kumar issued a joint statement on the working of Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Amit Shah
 Blast raising the question
 saajha bayaan main saaf taur par kaha gaya ki dilli kii chunavi haar se party netritv ne koi sabak nahin siikhaa
 Even before the adversary of the governing board, Shah sensed the opportunity, he clarified the statement of mps' reservation in the court of Sarsanghchalak Bhagwat present in Delhi
 khud sangh ne is maamle main koi bhi tippanee karne kii bajaae shah se party ke str par sthiti spasht karne ko kaha
 So is this a confrontation between the Sangh and the BJP? Or the modi-shah surrender of the BJP to the Sangh, which is going to be a big challenge? a senior Sangh official describes the allegations of BJP mps on Bhagwat as baseless
 unki daleel he, ''bijepi kaa vot pratishat badha he, jabaki argedy, congress or jedy(you) kaa vot pratishat pehle ke mukaable thodaa kam hua he
 The Mahagathbandhan has got more seats due to the unification of non-bjp votes
 agar bijepi kaa vot thodaa bahut bhi kam hota to sangh pramukh ke aarakshan vaale bayaan ko haar ke kaarnon main gina sakate the
 But this is not the case here
 '' sangh ke tewaron se saaf he ki usne bijepi ke aaropon kaa jawaab dene ke liye apane tarkash ko tiron se bhar liya he
 Certainly the bjp's defeat in Bihar has given the Sangh a chance to strengthen its hold on the party
 isaki vajah he—amit shah kaa prabandhan un rajyon main dher ho gaya jahaan use kadi chunauti mili
 "in Shah's tenure, we contested elections in six states, of which 4 won and two lost," says a BJP leader
 lekin ham vahiin jite jahaan muqabla trikoniya yaa chatushkoniya tha
 But where there was a face-to-face fight, all four got upset
 ''ab sangh chahta he ki kam se kam is tarah kii paristhiti uttar pradesh ke chunaav main nahin ho
 On 9 November, the next day after the election results, a strategy was chalked out to prepare a new blueprint for the organization
 sutron ke mutabik, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sangh ko apni manshaa bataa di he or ve chaahate hai ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi-shah kii jodi hi chunaav ladvaae
 That is, there is talk of Shah getting two consecutive terms
 lekin sangh ab bijepi ko sanghathan ke str par free hand dene ke mood main nahin dikh rahaa he
 If sources are to be believed, in meeting Shah, Bhagwat has asked the sangh-bjp coordination meeting to be regularized monthly
 agar paristhitiyaan anukool rahi to janvari 2016 se har maheene ke pehle hafte main suvidha ke mutabik is tarah kii baithken hongi
 Not only this, the Sangh is also considering sending some new campaigners to the BJP organization, which will be reflected in Shah's new team
 lekin jis tarah maardarshak mandal ne morcha khol diya he, usase yah bhi sawaal uthne laga he ki kya shah phir se adhyaksh ban paaenge
 The effect of Bihar election defeat will be seen in the government as well
 sarkaar se do tarah ke logon ko ab sanghathan main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Firstly those people who are needed in the organization and secondly those ministers who do not take risks due to any fear and their performance has been affected
 iske alaava centre sarkaar ke maatahat nigamon-board main bijepi kaaryakartaaon kii niyuktiyon kaa silsilaa shuru hoga
 The manner in which the activists were continuously pushed into successive campaigns also resulted in many ambitious schemes like Shah's mass campaign
 haalanki in niyuktiyon main deree ko sangh haar kii vajah ke taur par nahi dekh rahaa, balki ise sanghathan kii haar maan rahaa he
 According to sources, the Sangh chief also sent a message to Shah that the BJP needed to take a lesson from nitish-lalu as both were successful in getting their vote bank transferred to each other despite being hostile for a long time
 jabaki bijepi santhnik str par sadsyta, mahasampark, mahaprashikshan jaise kaarykram chalaakar bhi majboot virodhiyon kaa muqabla nahin kar paati
 The BJP is still caught in a duel in the causes of defeat in Bihar
 aupchaarik rup se samiksha baithkon kaa daur bihar main hone vaale chhath mahaparv ke baad shuru hogi
 But in the primary assessment, the BJP could not detect the pulse of Bihar's caste
 bihar ke ek party netaa bataate hai, ''agar kisi vyakti ke naam jatisuchak upnaam nahin laga ho to saamne vaale pita se lekar jila, prakhand, gaanv tak kaa naam poochhega or jati pahchaanane tak apana sawaal jari rakhata he
 This is the unique character of Bihar
 '' party ke netaa maanate hai ki bihar main bijepi ne 40 fisadi savarnon ko tikat diya
 He also missed out on giving assembly seats to the candidates
 itnaa hi nahin, aarthik package or digital india se shuru chunaav abhiyaan gaay par jaakar khatm hui
 The party deviated from its development agenda and got caught in the trap of the opposition
 saath hi, party is gumaan main rahi ki 35 fisadi vot mahagathbandhan ke paas he to baaki ke vot uski jholii main giregi
 a BJP leader says that the party is identified with Hindutva
 lekin vikaas ke agenda par jaakar party funs jaati he
 He argues that no matter the government, development is the agenda
 lekin kisi party kii apni alag visheshta hoti he or bijepi ko ab aatmamanthan karnaa hoga ki use vikaas chahie yaa hindutv? yaa phir is dwandv main isi tarah chunavi nuksaan jhelegi?bihar chunaav ke nateezon ke baad bijepi ke bheetar jis tarah antarvirodh ubhare hai, usase modi-shah kii jodi phir sangh kii sharan main dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, the Sangh's role as mediator is bound to emerge
 lekin yah tathy he ki 2004 kii haar ke baad bhi sangh ne aise hi party kii kaman sanbhali thi
 Yet 10 years BJP has been deprived of power at the Center
 kya sirf achche dinon ke ''shah"1 naakaam prabandhandilli kii tarj par bihar kaa micro management kiya gaya
 But all preparations perished
 2 4 banaam 2 rajyamaharashtra, haryana, jharkhand, jammu-kashmir main bahukoniya mukaable main bijepi jiti, par sidhi ladaai main dilli-bihar main dharashayi ho gai
 3 halted the mass campaign has failed completely
 isaki gati sarkaar ke prachaar abhiyaan main sakriyata se thahar gai
 The 4-package-digital to cow promotion campaign started with development and the economic package, Digital India, finally ended with a woman ad hugging cow
 5 aarakshan par vivadaarakshan par modi ke bachaav vaale bayaan se agade votaron kaa utsaah kamjor padaa jo bijepi ke liye nuksandeh rahi
 The match-fixing incident also struck the Pakistani team on the Sri Lankan cricket team after reports said that its top players like Tillakaratne Dilshan and Dilhara Fernando were questioned by the icc's anti-corruption and Security Unit
 ‘daily mail’ ne aaj daawa kiya ki srilanka ke liye 63 test or 188 vanade khel chuke dilashaan ek satorie se kathith tallukaat ke kaaran isisi kii najaron main hai
 Regarding Fernando, a Sri Lankan newspaper 'the Island' said that the ICC has been investigating him for two years
 srilanka cricket board ne haalanki apane khilaadiyon kaa purajor bachaav karte hue kaha ki dilashaan ke khilaaf aarope ‘chaaritrak hanan’ kii koshish he jabaki fernadon ne khud isisi ko bataaya tha ki satorie ne usase sampark kiya tha
 The Daily Mail claimed that Dilshan is the same player whose name was written by the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in a report submitted to the icc's anti-corruption Unit last year
 use landan ke ek nitaclub main kathith satorie ke saath dekha gaya tha
 Sri Lankan cricket spokesman Brian Thomas said in Colombo that no charges had been made against Dilshan
 unhone kaha,‘jahaan tak hamaara sawaal he to dilashaan ke khilaaf koi aarope nahin lagaaye gaye hai
 If there were any allegations, the ICC would have informed us
 ham jaanate hai ki hamaare khilaadi paak saaf hai

 Gambhir believes that finger spinners like Ashwin can prove to be more effective than wrist spinners in England conditions
 2011 main worldcup jeetne vaale bhartiya team ke sadsy rahe gambhir ne haal hi main cricket se sanyas liya he
 Significantly, Ashwin is currently out of the short format Indian team
 unhone bharat kii taraf se antim vanade july 2017 main khelaa tha

 Gautam Gambhir did not stop laughing at the run out, did this interesting tweet
 
 
 aswin (ravichandran Ashwin) ke saath baayen haath ke leg spinner rabindra jadeja ko bhi shorter formet kii bhartiya team se baahar hona padaa tha, lekin jadeja vaapasi karne main safal rahe
 Gambhir said on the sidelines of an event here, 'both wrist spinners (kuldeep and Chahal) have done well in the last one year but i still believe that Ashwin is the bowler whose name we should consider
 
 meraa maananaa he ki ek yogya spinner hameshaa ucch shrenee kaa hota he bhale hi vah kalai kaa spinner ho yaa anguliyon kaa
 Gambhir gave the example of Australia's Nathan Lyon, who recently returned to the ODI team after performing well in Test cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘vah (leone) sambhavat: duniya kaa abhi sarvshereshth spinner he or vah anguliyon kaa spinner he
 i think we should not make a difference that there is a wrist spinner in the team and hence there is no place for a finger spinner
 ' gambhir ne kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki aswin (ravichandran Ashwin) aisa khilaadi he jiske naam par vichaar kiya janaa chahie kyonki hamen saal ke us samay main england kii paristhitiyon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana hoga
 The wicket can be flat and in such a situation the finger spinner can prove to be effective

 indian cinema's pride
 My salutes to God's own child @ssrajamouli and his team !!! # masterpiece ek maheene main JMB ke chah aatanki giraftaar hue hai,inamen bharat main sanghathan kaa pramukh bhi shamilojhmbh par pratibandh laga he, giraftaar shaks kii pahchaan asadullah urf raja ke taur par hui he We have already told you the benefits of turmeric
 zyaadaatar logon ko pataa hoga ki haldi kai tarah kii bimariyon or kamajori main phydemand hota he
 It has been used as a medicine for a long time
 ek acha anti-septic hone ke saath hi se shoth-rodhi bhi hota he
 While turmeric is very beneficial for health, it also has some side-effects
 haalanki haldi tabhi nuksaan karti he jab wo bahut adhik maatra main lee jaae
 Besides knowing the benefits of turmeric, it is very important for you to know its disadvantages as well: 1
 galle blader / pittashay main samasyagar aapako pittashay se judi koi samasya he to haldi vaala doodhaapaki is samasya ko or badha degaa
 If there is a stone in your gallbladder then you should not drink turmeric milk
 2
 Bleeding problem: If you have bleeding problem then turmeric milk can harm you
 ye blad clotting kii prakriya ko kam kar detaa he jisase bleeding kii samaya or adhik bad sakati he
 3
 madhumeh kii sthiti menhaldi main ek rasinic padaarth karcumin paaya jaataa he
 Which affects blood sugar
 aise main agar aapako madhumeh he to haldi vaala doodh pine se parhez karnaa hi behatar hoga
 4
 napunsakata kaa karanhaldi, testosteron ke str ko kam kar detii hai
 This reduces the activation of sperm
 agar aap apni family plan kar rahe hai to koshish kiijie ki haldi kaa seven sanyamit rup se karen
 5
 aayran kaa avasoshnahaldi kaa bahut adhik seven karne se aayran kaa avasorana bad jaataa he
 Those who are already deficient in iron should consume turmeric very carefully
 6
 During the surgery as we have already told that turmeric does not allow blood clotting
 jisaki vajah se khun kaa straav bad jaataa he
 Avoid turmeric if you have surgery or are about to undergo it
 yah sunakar aapako sambhavat: aashcharya hoga ki film industry main jisaki filmon ko aap chhodana nahin chaahate or antarrashtriya manoranjan main jisane apni khaas pahchaan banaai he, vah darasal, class 6 fail he

 Bharatiya Janata Party's National General Secretary and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley, while attacking Uttarakhand on the last day of campaigning for the assembly elections, said that Congress has introduced a 'division Document' rather than 'vision Document' in Uttar Pradesh because It has pledged to give religion based reservation which will give more boost to the fundamentalists in the country
 jetali ne kaha ki dharm aadhaarit aarakshan kaa to is desh ke purv pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru, purv grahamantri sardaar ballab bhai patel tathaa anya sabhi logon ne virodh kiya tha kyonki yah vichaar desh ko ek or vibhaajan ke liye prerit karata
 He said that now Congress is doing the same thing
 unhone kaha ki congress dwaara dharm aadhaarit aarakshan ke madhyam se desh main ab vikaas or shashan ke agenda ko badalane kii koshish shuru kii gayi he
 He said that earlier it was said that four and a half percent reservation would be given
 phir uttar pradesh main kaha gaya ki 9 pratishat aarakshan diya jayega or ab kaha ja rahaa he jansankhya ke aadhaar par aarakshan diya jayega
 This will encourage those who divide the country
 rajyasabha main netaa pratipaksh jetali ne kaha ki mandal ayog ke tahat hindu or musalamaanon kii kuch pichhadi jatiyon ko aarakshan kaa laabh mil rahaa he lekin ab dharm aadhaarit aarakshan kaa vaayada karke jo vijan dacument pesh kiya gaya he vah un pichhadon ke haq ko chhinane vaala sabit hoga
 He alleged that the Congress wants to do politics by increasing social tension in the country
 congress ko is dacument par phir se vichaar karnaa chaiye
 This will encourage radical forces
 jetali ne kaha ki congress ne uttarakhand ke saath kabhi mitraapurna vyavhaar nahin kiya
 Even when it was time to form Uttarakhand, the Congress did not support and when it came to financially prospering this state, the Congress reduced the time limit for special industrial package from 2013 to 2010 as part of a conspiracy
 bhaajapa ne uttarakhand or himachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri kaa saath dekar is nirnay kaa purajor virodh kiya tha
 In contrast, he said that BJP has always dealt favorably with Uttarakhand, whether it is a separate state formation issue, whether it is a matter of giving a special package for economic development
 unhone kaha ki kisi bhi rajya ke shashan ke liye netritv or vishwasaneeyata donon mahatvapurn tathy hai
 The BJP is going to benefit in terms of both these facts by contesting elections under the leadership of Chief Minister Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri as Khanduri has stood up in terms of leadership and credibility
 unke netritv main ham chunaav jitate hai to yah anya rajyon ke liye ek udhaaharan banegaa
 BJP national general secretary Jaitley said that the BJP is fighting unitedly this time with full force and whatever the Congress may say in the elections, but its attitude towards Uttarakhand has always been malicious
 unhone kaha ki puure desh main congress ke khilaaf hawa he
 There is no credibility of the Congress government at the Center
 aarthik morche par yah sarkaar naakaam rahi he
 New dimensions of corruption have emerged
 unhone kaha duusari ore uttarakhand main bhaajapa sarkaar kaa kaarykaal behad acha rahaa he
 Health care services have developed well
 unhone kaha ki khanduri ke eemaandaar hone kaa party ko rajnatik laabh milegaa or yah vishay bhi puure desh main majbootee se ubharegaa
 On the question of postponing Salman Rushdie's visit to India, he said that it was a move of the Congress government at the Center in view of the elections in Uttar Pradesh
 rushdi chah se saat baar bharat kii yatra kar chuke hai, tab to koi samasya nahin huyi thi
 In response to another question, he said that in Uttar Pradesh, Uma Bharti has already made it clear that she is not a contender for the post of Chief Minister
 kabhi desh kii sabase teji se badhane vaali automobil industry kii raftaar par brake lag chukaa he
 The decline in domestic demand has resulted in the sale of vehicles, especially passenger vehicles, to a 19-year low
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne haal main kaha ki ab ola, ubar kii sevaayen sasti honi ke kaaran khaskar yuva log car nahin khareednaa chaah rahe
 However, a research by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has revealed that the biggest reason for the decline in car sales is the continuous increase in the prices of petrol and diesel
 kya kahata he RBI kaa researcheshbhi ne apane ek research paper main kaha he, 'hamane yah paaya ki macro level par, eendhan keemton main badlaav se automobile cells par negative asar padaa he, or isamen karj (lone milane main dikkat) kaa koi bada asar nahin dikhataa
 Based on our analysis, we found that the recent sluggishness can be better understood on the basis of higher fuel prices
 'ab taxi registration giravatwaise yah sach he ki pichley kuch varshon main ola, ubar jaisi kifayati taxi agrigater sevaaon kaa puure desh ke kai shaharon main jabardast growth hua he
 It was because of the expansion of these services that taxi registration increased significantly in the first several years
 lekin saal 2016 se taxi registration main aanshik taur par giravat dekhi jane lagi, isaki vajah yah ho sakati he ki in sevaaon main paripakvata aane lagi or taxi aapurti main paripurnataa aa gai
 Since then, taxi registrations account for about 6% of the total four wheeler market and this is also partly due to the decline in car sales in the last two years
 bharat ke metro shaharon main city taxi sevaayen to pehle bhi lokapriy rahi hai, lekin isamen saal 2010 main to vastav main ek tarah kii kranti aa gai, jab ola ne ap aadhaarit taxi seva shuru kii

 1989 main bhartiya hockey team main ek khilaadi ne debyue kiya tha
 This player took Indian hockey to a new height
 dhanraj pillai kaa janm 16 july 1968 ko hua tha
 Dhanraj is the only player to have four Olympics (1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004), four World Cups (1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002), four Champions Trophies (1995, 1996, 2002, and 2003) and four Asian Games
 (1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002)
 iske alaavadhanraj pillabangkok asian games main sabase zyada gol karne vaale khilaadi the
 In the 1994 World Cup in Sydney, he was the only Indian to be included in the World XI
 khel ratna or padmashri rah chuke dhanraj ko janmdin kii hardik shubhakamanaayen
 Pillai is currently the manager of the Indian hockey team
 nai dilli ke sansad maarg par sthit sanchaar bhawan desh kii aarthik yatra main kuch sabase aniatik maukon kaa gavaah rahaa he
 When the country's telecom sector was making huge jumps like kangaroos, many ministers came and went in a jolt in the ministry
 maujuuda mantri ravishankar prasad ne associat editor shweta punj ke saath buniyadi dhaanche main nivesh or sevaaon kii gunvattta main sudhaar ke prati telecom companiyon kii anichhaa ke bare main baat kii or apni naaraazgi chhipaai nahin
 Excerpts from the conversation: You have been very vocal about call drops
 aapaki raay main kya ho rahaa he, hamen itani giravat kyon dekhni pad rahi he?mantri ke naate mere dohare lakshya hai&telecom kshetra kii vruddhi or graahakon ko santoshjanak seva
 i have been speaking publicly on the whole issue of the alleged harmful effects of radiation
 main kah yah rahaa hum ki baad main hone vaale asar ke bare main koi spasht chikitsakeey saboot nahin he
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has studied it
 meraa kahana he, agar koi bhi mujhe gaiyr-iradatan thos saboot dikhaane ke liye taiyaar he, to main bataur mantri us par vichaar karne ko taiyaar hum
 There will always be radiation
 aap eks-re ke liye jaaen to radiation hoga
 If you turn on your mobile, there will be radiation
 aap apana microwave chaalu karen to radiation hoga
 If you go to the airport, there is radiation
 mudda yah he ki kya yah khatarnaak he, kya nahin he
 So i have appealed to the people that complaints against call drops and campaigns against Tower Radiation cannot go hand in hand
 maine telecom sachiv se kaha he ki vah sarkari parisaron main beaties (base transmishan stesan) lagane kii ijaajat dene ke liye shahari vikaas mantralay se baat karen
 i propose to write to all Chief Ministers and ask them to formulate the right policy in an impartial manner
 to, mantri ke taur par main apana kaam kar rahaa hum, lekin jahaan tak vyavastha ko majboot banane kii baat he, to yah unka (telecom companiyon kaa) kaam he
 i would like to say very clearly that they need to do more to strengthen their systems
 main logon se or resident welfare associations se bhi apil karuunga ki ek kathith ashanka par jarurat se zyada jor dena vaazib nahin he
 So, this means that telecom companies are not investing enough in infrastructure
 main doshaaropan ke khel main nahin paduunga
 All i am urging them is that they must first strengthen their infrastructure to deal with the urgent problem of call drops
 baat bilkul sidhi or sapaat he
 Infrastructure is important
 or main rajya sarkaron se bhi guzarish karuunga ki beaties ke mudde ko buniyadi dhaanche ke hisse kii taur par dekhen
 i am willing to walk four steps more from my side and so should they
 bhartiya telecom companiyaan baaki duniya main unki samakaksh companiyon ko ausatan hasil spectrum se bhi bahut kam se kaam chalaa rahi hai
 What is your opinion? We introduced 470 mhz in four bands and sold 450 mhz
 raksha spectrum ke saath jodgaye or milaane kaa kaam pehle se hi chal rahaa he
 And any spectrum that can be freed will be made available
 lekin yah puri daleel mujhe samaj main nahin aati ki jab tak zyada spectrum nahin hoga, ham system ko majboot nahin banaaenge
 You have already got spectrum in the recent past, you make it stronger
 telecom companiyon ko apane bheetar jhaankne kii jarurat he
 Shouldn't the telecom regulator TRAI play an exaggerated role to resolve quality issues? We have already formally sought a report from the regulator about creating a mechanism to encourage or discourage the need 
 spectrum itane saare mahakamon main baanta jaataa he
 Space, Defense, Police
 aisa lagata he ki telecom mahakme ko zyada spectrum hasil karne ke liye molbhav main kaaphi jaddojahad kerani pad rahi he
 You have to look at it from a historical perspective
 landline ke liye aapako spectrum kii jarurat nahin padati thi, ye sab cabel par aadhaarit the
 The importance of spectrum came to light only when mobile phones were launched, so spectrum was traditionally being used in the defense sector itself
 uske baad kuch had tak antariksh or police main kiya ja rahaa tha
 The real pressure on the spectrum came only after the mobile phone trend increased
 unhen jodgaye or milaane kaa mudda bhi ab lambey vakt se raksha mantralay main lambit he
 Will more spectrum be auctioned? Yes, we have more spectrum, we will auction it
 lekin spectrum kii kami ke bare main yah lagaataar hai-tauba machaana, mujhe pasand nahin he
 It cannot be used as an excuse to not make the system strong

 Even today in our society many things are decided on the basis of gender
 ladakon ko jahaan ghar parivaar se zyada saport miltaa he vahiin ladakiyon ko doum darje kaa samajha jaataa he
 Women are considered weak and for men it is labeled as 'man does not hurt'
 mardon ko baahar kamaane ke liye bheja jaataa he vahiin mahilaon ko gharelu samajha jaataa he
 But there are many men in the society who like to do kitchen work, cleanliness, but under social pressure they refuse to accept these things
 aaie jaanate hai ve 6 wo badi baaten jo purush karte hai lekin maanane se inkaar karte hai
 1
 purushon kaa mahilaon se zyada kamanaa jaise ek aghoshit niyam ban gaya he
 There is a difference in the salary of women and men in every institution
 haalanki aadhunik samay main kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki patni apane pati se zyada kamaane lagati he
 This causes an uneasiness within men
 haalanki kai log ise maanane se inkaar karte hai
 2
 khaanaa banane ko lekar bhi samaaj main ek dharna he ki khaanaa bananaa mahilaon kaa kaam he jabaki aisa nahin he
 Neither is it only women's work nor do all women like to cook
 kai purush aise hai jinhen khaanaa bananaa behad pasand hota he or ve kichan main apni patni kii madad bhi karte hai
 However, under the pressure of social pressure, he refuses to believe that he loves working in the kitchen
 3
 It is said that 'man does not feel pain' but it is absolutely wrong
 ye sirf kehane kii baat he
 Men also have similar pain
 imotional hone kii baat karen to kai ladke to ladakiyon se bhi zyada imotional hote hai
 However, men refuse to accept this
 video game: 'aag' se khel rahaa he aapkaa baccha!4
 If a girl praises a male friend repeatedly in front of her husband or boyfriend, it makes them feel that they are being compared
 is baat se har purush ko jalan hoti he
 However, they refuse to accept it
 5
 We have heard that girls are focused on which make-up is done by which girl or which dress is worn by which girl
 lekin aisa ladke bhi karte hai
 Many boys like to see the fashion sense of other boys
 agar pasand aae to ve use apnaane se bhi nahin jhijakte
 However, no one believes this
 shaadi tuutane kii hoti hai ye 8 mukhya vajahen!6
 Sajna is adorned not only by girls but also by boys
 lekin aksar ladke is baat ko maanane se inkaar karte hai

 The Court, citing Section 18 of the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act, remarked that if such an interpretation was agreed, the law would never apply

 The initial 10 and the last 10 overs do not matter much, as these overs are just like any T20 match

 President Pratibha Patil has called on the Naxalites to leave the violence and adopt a path of dialogue and join the mainstream of development and work for the progress of the tribal people
 chhattisgarh vidhansabha ko sambodhit karte hue patil ne kaha ki chhattisgarh kuch anya rajyon ke samaan hi naksalwad kii samasya kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 There have been several unfortunate incidents of Naxalite violence in the recent past, many of which have been known to be priceless
 sabhi ko yaad rakhana hoga ki desh ke vikaas ke liye shanti kii sthapana ho or use kaayam rakhana bahut jaruri he
 In fact, nothing is gained by following the path of violence
 yah keval vinaash or pidaa detii he
 The President said that no matter how big the problem is, it can be resolved through dialogue and dialogue
 hinsa or hatya nindaneey aparaadh he or inhen kisi bhi sabhy samaaj main sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Patil said, 'I will call upon the Naxalites and all other people engaged in violence to give up violence, hold talks, think properly and feasibly and facilitate the progress of our tribal people by joining the mainstream of development
 
 ’unhone kaha ki samvidhan main shaamil hamaare mulyon jaise saamaajik sauhaard tathaa shanti ke siddhanton par chalakar logon kii behatari or desh kii pragati ke liye mil-julkar kaary karen, kyonki hamaare lakshya mahatvapurn he, isliye hosh se kaam karen josh se nahin
 Pratibha Patil said that in our scriptures, emphasis has been laid on moving forward together
 hamen is raah par chalane main kai dikkatein kai samasyaayein or mushkilen aaengi, lekin iskaa saamana karte hue apni raah par chalate rahanaa hoga

 isliye hamen iske prati apni jimmedaari ko samajhnaa hoga
 The President said that the economy of our country is moving towards rapid development
 is achche pradarshan ke kaaran aaj hamaara desh vishwa vyavastha main ek majboot bhagidaar ke rup main ubharkar aayaa he
 It is said that this century will be of Asia and India's role will be prominent in it, but we all should note that the benefit of this progress in the economy is still not reaching every section of the society
 sahi myne main vikaas kaa arth he, raashtra samrudh ho, uske naagarik vivekshil or shikshit hon, aapas main bhaichara or desh main sushasan ho tathaa pragati kaa laabh samaaj ke har tabake or khaskar vanchit logon tak pahunche
 Along with this, there should be balanced progress and benefits of welfare programs should reach everyone
 yahi mahatma gandhi kaa sapana tha or yahi hamaara prayaas bhi hona chahie
 Patil also inaugurated the newly constructed central chamber in the assembly building on the occasion

 The daughter and daughter-in-law of the Gwalior royal family and daughter-in-law of the royal family of Dholpur and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia's personality and behavior are often discussed
 janpratinidhi hone ke baavjood vasundhara raaje tak aam va khaas donon hi varg kii pahunch ko tedi kheer mana jaataa he
 While the Opposition keeps accusing them of being arrogant, at times there are voices of resentment against them from inside the Bharatiya Janata Party
 aise main ab jabaki rajasthan ek baar phir vidhansabha chunaav ke liye taiyaar he, to sawaal ye uth rahe hai ki vasundhara raaje ke prati netaaon kii naaraazgi bhartiya janata party ke liye nuksaandaayak na ban jaae
 In this episode, there are some leaders of Rajasthan BJP who have severed ties with the party criticizing the conduct of Vasundhara Raje
 inamenghanshyamatiwadi, maanavendra singh aurahanumanbeniwal jaise pramukh naam shaamil hai
 While senior BJP leader and former Chief Minister Bhairon Singh Shekhawat's son-in-law Narpat Rajvi has kept a front against the Vasundhara government while still in the party
 ghanashyam tiwadighanashyam tiwadi bijepi ke diggaj netaaon main shumaar kiye jate the
 He has been the Minister of Energy in the Bhairon Singh Shekhawat government, but his ideological differences with the Vasundhara government were heard publicly
 6 baar vidhayak nirvaachit hue, jinamein se do baar unhen mantri banane kaa avasar bhi mila
 Tiwari, who won the most votes in the 2013 assembly elections, hoped that Vasundhara Raje would definitely include her in the cabinet, but that did not happen
 iske baad vah vasundhara ke khilaaf bayaanbaji karne lage
 After separating from the BJP, Tiwari has formed a political party called 'bharat Vahini', which has also got recognition from the Election Commission
 haalanki, unhone apane bete akhilesh ko party kaa sansthaapak or adhyaksh banaaya he
 Tiwari has called for contesting all the seats in the assembly and is also trying to form a non-bjp-congress front
 maanavendra singhbijapi ke varisht netaa or kendriya mantri rahe jaswant singh ke bete maanavendra singh bhi bhartiya janata party se alag ho gaye hai
 He held a Swabhiman rally in Pachpadra, Barmer in the last week of September and announced his family's four-decade-old relationship with the BJP
 maanavendra singh ne yahaan tak kah diya ki 'camel kaa phool, badi bhul' thi
 Manvendra's father Jaswant Singh and CM Vasundhara Raje had a very good relationship at first, but in the last seven-eight years there has been a distance between the two
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main barmer se jasamvat singh ko tikat dene ke bajaay karnal sonaaram choudhary ko maidan main utaara gaya
 Vasundhara Raje was considered the main reason behind Jaswant's ticket being cut
 bijepi se tikat na milane ke baad jaswant singh nirdaleey taur par chunaav lade
 Despite the Modi wave, Jaswant Singh managed to get more than 4 lakh votes, but did not win
 maanavendra bijepi kaa hissaa the, magar unhone apane pita ke khilaaf or bijepi pratyaashee sonaaram choudhary ke paksh main prachaar karne se manaa kar diya
 Manvendra was then expelled from the party along with being excluded from the bjp's national executive
 bijepi chhodane se pehle unhone vasundhara raaje kii gaurav yatra main bhi shirkat nahin kii
 Even Manvendra refused to take Vasundhara Raje's Gaurav Yatra in his constituency Shiva
 maanavendra singh kaa janaa kya bijepi ko chunaav main nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he? is sawaal par raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki agar maanavendracongreska daaman thamte hai to marwar main party ko phayda pahunch saktaa he or bijepi nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 This is because the Rajput society is dominated here and Jaswant Singh and his family, active in politics for decades, have a lot of influence here
 narpat singh rajvipurv uparashtrapati bhaerosingh shekhavat ke damaad or bijepi vidhayak narpat singh rajvi ne bhi apni hi party ke netaaon ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he
 He recently wrote a letter to Vasundhara Raje and told that the BJP leaders of Jaipur are involved in corruption
 narpat ke in aaropon ne congress ko bada mauka de diya he or party ke pradesh adhyaksh sachin payalat bijepi par sansthagat bhrashtachar ke aarope laga rahe hai
 The party had to be clarified on the allegations of Narpat and the leaders also met him
 haalanki, narpat singh rajvi ne bijepi chhodane yaa congress main jane kaa koi faisla nahin liya he
 But these opposing voices are causing trouble for the BJP
 hanuman beniwalhanuman beniwal ne 2008 kaa vidhansabha chunaav bijepi ke tikat par ladaa tha or jeet darj kii thi
 After this, before the 2013 elections, he made statements against many big leaders of BJP
 beniwal ne vasundhara raaje or rajendra rathod jaise bade netaaon par bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaaya
 He was then expelled from the party
 unhone nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur bheenvasar seat se chunaav ladaa or jeet gaye
 Beniwal, who hails from Nagaur district, has emerged as a prominent Jat leader of the state
 bijepi se naaraazgi ke bich aagaamee chunaav ke maddenjar wo jat samudaay ko ekajute karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 There is also talk of an alliance with Ghanshyam Tiwari
 agar aise sameekaran ban pate hai yaa ye netaa or dal chunaav main bijepi ke virodh karte hai to uske liye mushkil khadi ho sakati he
 Explain that Nagaur, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Bharatpur and Jodhpur are called Jat belt and the Jat community has influence over about 60 seats in the state
 bijepi se baghawat karne vaale netaaon se party kaa rajya main raajnneetik sameekaran bigadataa dikh rahaa he
 Ghanshyam is a Tiwari Brahmin leader, while Manvendra Singh and Narpat Singh come from the Rajvi Rajput community
 vahiin, hanuman beniwal jat samudaay se taalluk rakhte hai
 These three societies have a significant impact in the politics of Rajasthan
 aise main inkaa gathjod or samarthan yaa virodh bijepi ke liye satta kii vaapasi main badi baadha ban saktaa he
 In such a situation, the people of the state are eyeing these four leaders

 After Pooja's disappearance, her family members filed a complaint against Kalu
 kaalu ne sakhti se poochtacha ke dauraan apnajurm kabuulakar liya tha
 The mistress of the house from which the skeleton was recovered, the government is very scared
 unhone kaha, unka parivaar kaaphi sakate main hai ki jis ghar main vah rahete hai, uske neeche laash ko dafnaaya gaya tha
 The family members of Pooja have demanded strict punishment against Kalu

 The most watched trailer, Salman's Tiger broke Hollywood's record, so what Zoya's nationality will also be changed

 Sri Sunny Deol has done a good job
 aadmi chota ho yaa bada, fark nahin padataa
 His story should be big
 magar jis film dhishkiaun main unhone yah gyaan diya, uski kahani bahut uljhi hui he
 And despite all the scope and efforts in this affair, the film could not hit the punch
 film ke dialog achche hai
 They have drama as well as humor
 gane bahut achche hai
 If you are not of my type, then the public is listening, Sneha and Vishal sang Nisar and Arijit sang Aashiqui should also be heard
 acting kii baat karen to harman baweja thik thaak hai
 He should manage himself with endurance by doing some multi-starrer films right now

 What is the story of Taraviki is the most beaten in childhood
 ek don motaa tony use bataata he, palatakar maar
 Vicky asks if he killed
 tony jawaab detaa, wo to pehle se hi tuje maar rahaa he
 Just here, Vicky's life agenda is set
 use bada hokar gangster bananaa he
 Vicky becomes a gangster
 yaheen se anderworld kii sajishein shuru hoti hai
 Sixty-six loots, deception, factionalism from the police and the desire to become the biggest don himself, all start to shake
 iske saath hi viki se pyaar karne lagate hai
 Then the same track that you have to choose one in love and bullet

 anand tiwari naam he
 You saw this as the boyfriend of Bahadurgarh girl in Ayesha
 phir go goa gon main baba ji kii booti gaate dekha
 Seeing them, it seemed like it magar har baar lujar tip role hi kyon
 This film also bridged that gap
 film main anand rocky ke role main najar aate hai
 a hatella type but an outgoing gangster
 isse unki acting range bhi saamne ai
 Another great actor
 jin par pehle bhi kaaphi kuch likhaa ja chukaa he
 Prashant Narayan
 unhen janata zyaadaatar murder 2 ke villen ke taur par yaad rakhti he
 In this film, he has acted well in the role of Tony
 baaki sabaki acting kharchaa pani tip he
 The film is stylish
 kuch nai lokation bhi dikhaai gai hai
 Action etc are from regular
 gaanon ke bol achche hai
 It would have been nice if the same imaginativeness was used in his shoot
 vaise kalpana kii baat karen to tu mere tip kaa nahin he, gaanaa jabardast he
 Use and shoot of lyrics, music, in every sense
 ise gaanaa he kunal or gayatri ayyar ne
 So what is advisable is Dhishkiyaun is a good masala film
 harman baweja hero he, sirf isliye hi is film ko khaarij mat kariega
 This is just the advice
 mujhe lagata he ki is tarah kii maar dhaad, ection or romaanch kii single screen or kasbon main acchhee khapat hogi

 After passing the bill making the triple talaq illegal and non-bailable offense from Lok Sabha, Modi government will present it in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday
 haalanki sarkaar ke liye is bill ko rajyasabha se paarit karana itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 During this time the government and opposition parties can be face to face
 muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak-2017(the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill) par modi sarkaar kii asli pariksha rajyasabha main hogi
 The path of this bill in Rajya Sabha is not as easy as it was in Lok Sabha
 lihaaja centre sarkaar ne apni taraf se puri taiyaari kar lee he or vipakshi dalon se is bare main baat bhi kii gai he
 The biggest thing is that the government had a tremendous majority in the Lok Sabha, on the basis of which, it included ace-the, including Asaduddin Owaisi easily bypassed the opposition of a few mps 
 haalanki rajyasabha main sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he or kaaphi kuch is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki is masale par congress kaa rukh kya rahata he? vahiin, vidheyak par aage kaa rukh tay karne ke liye vipakshi dal mangalvaar subah milane vaale hai
 The BJP, benefiting from Rahul Gandhi's image, is feeling somewhat relieved that the Congress has benefited from adopting the path of soft Hindutva in the Gujarat elections, and that it does not smash its image by stopping the triple talaq bill Would like loksabhaa main jab yah bill paaritahua, tab rahul gandhi sadan main maujuud nahin the
 It is believed that Rahul Gandhi does not want to damage his image by opposing the triple talaq bill
 bill par baikfoot par congressvaise bhi teen talaak bill par bahes ke dauraan loksabhaa main jis tarah se baar-baar shahbaano maamle ko lekar congress par hamalaa hua or uske netaaon ko nazren nichi karke sunanaa padaa, uske baad se congress teen talaak ko lekar bahut aakraamak rukh apnaane kii haalat main nahin dikhti
 Congress will demand to send the bill to the Select Committee, despite all this, Congress may insist on removing the provision to make triple talaq non-bailable immediately
 loksabhaa main bahes ke dauraan bhi congress ke mallikarjun khadge ne yah baat kahi thi, lekin rajyasabha main ho saktaa he ki congress is baat par jor dekar is bill ko pravar samiti (select committee) ke paas ke paas bhejne kii maang kare
 This is the argument of the opposition parties on the bill
 During the debate in the Lok Sabha, many opposition parties, including the Congress, argued that if the husband will be sent to jail due to triple talaq, it will be very difficult for the wife to get alimony, because jailed
 Under any circumstances, the husband will not be able to give alimony to his wife
 is dauraan yah bhi tark diya gaya tha ki shuhar ko jail bhej dene se sulah kii koi ummid nahin rah jaaegi
 It may be difficult to pass in this session
 Even in the Rajya Sabha, a party will not like to be called anti-women by directly supporting the triple talaq, but will ask for some amendment in the provisions of this bill by taking some nuggets
 haalanki sarkaar kii mushkil yah he ki agar is bill main koi bhi sanshodhan manjuur kiya jaataa he, to ise phir se paas karaane ke liye loksabhaa bhejnaa hoga
 At the same time, the winter session ends on January 5
 isliye sarkaar ke paas zyada vakt nahin he, lekin agar bill upree sadan kii pravar samiti (select committee) ke paas chalaa jaataa he, to phir ye bill is satr main sansad se paarit nahin ho paaegaa
 Such is the condition of the ruling party in Rajya Sabha, BJP does not have majority in Rajya Sabha
 aise main bill ko paas karaane ke liye duusare dalon ke saath kii jarurat he
 The 245-member Rajya Sabha has 88 NDA mps (including 57 BJP mps), 57 of Congress, 18 of SP, 8 of BJD, 13 of AIADMK, 12 of Trinamool Congress and 5 of NCP
 agar sarkaar ko apane sabhi sahyogi dalon kaa saath mil jaataa he, to bhi bill ko paarit karaane ke liye kam se kam 35 or saansadon ke samarthan kii jarurat hogi
 Many political parties including Biju Janata Dal (BJD), AIADMK, SP and Trinamool Congress are opposing this bill
 jaldbaaji main bill laai sarkaar yechurimarxvaadi communist party ke mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki unki party teen talaak kaa virodh karti he or iskaa khaatmaa chaahati he, lekin is vidheyak main ek aapraadhik pahalu jod diya gaya he
 Marriage among Muslims is a civil agreement and the new law is adding a criminal aspect to it, which is wrong
 unhone kaha, "bhaajapa rajnatik laabh or sampradayik dhruvikaran ke liye is vidheyak ko jaldbaaji main lekar ai he
 "SC gave the government 6 months time to make a law
 The Supreme Court has already declared triple talaq i
e
 divorce-e-biddat
 22 agast ko sheersh adaalat kii paanch jajon kii bench ne bahumat se teen talaak ko asanvaidhanik or gaiyr kanoonee bataaya tha
 At the same time, the Modi government was asked to enact laws to protect the rights of Muslim women
 loksabhaa main teen talaak bill par charchaa ke dauraan bhi sarkaar ne supreme court ke faisle kaa hawala diya
 It will happen, the triple talaq billmody government has brought this bill in the name of 'muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill-2017'
 ye kanoon sirf teen talaak (INSTANT TALAQ, yani talaak-e-biddat) par hi lagu hoga
 After this law, if any Muslim man gives three divorces to his wife, it will be illegal
 iske baad se kisi bhi swaroop main diya gaya teen talaak, vah chahen maukhik ho yaa likhit ho or yaa phir massej ke jariye ho, avaidh hoga
 Whoever gives three divorces can be punished and fined for three years, ie, giving three divorces will be a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 isamen magistrate tay karegaa ki kitna jurmaana hoga
 PM Narendra Modi had formed a group of ministers to legislate on triple talaq, which included Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, PP Chaudhary and Jitendra Singh
 teen talaak bill main ye hai praavdhaan- ek saath teen baar talaak (bolkar, likhakar yaa email, esemes or whatsap jaise electronic madhyam se) kahana gaiyrkanoonee hoga
 - The husband doing so may be sentenced to three years of imprisonment
 yah gaiyr-jamaanti or sangyeya aparaadh mana jayega
 - This law will apply only to 'talaq a biddat' i
e
 three times a divorce
 - talaak kii peedita apane or naaballig bacchon ke liye guzaara bhatta maangane ke liye magistrate se apil kar sakegi
 - The aggrieved woman can also request the magistrate for the protection of minor children
 magistrate is mudde par antim faisla karenge
 - This proposed law will apply to the entire country except Jammu and Kashmir

 The truth of relationships on the test of research
 
 
 |'kamasutra' main kya he
 
 
 According to a study by Laura vandenbauch and Steve Igermont of Leuven Catholic University in Belgium, the effect of television programs shown on sexual attitudes depends on gender
 banie vafaadaar, na ki 'bevafa sanam'
 
 
 love-kissing According to the journal 'sex Rolls', a good relationship with the mother is protective for girls, while a strong attachment to the mother for boys increases the likelihood that they are stereotyped as shown on television
 Will make the approach
 vandenboch or igarmont ne apane surveykshan main belgium ke nau skulon ke 16 varsh ke 1,026 kishoron ko shaamil kiya
 According to a statement from the Catholic University, the researchers tested their recreational behavior towards teens sexually
 udhaaharan ke taur par kishoron kii unke saathi ke prati patibaddhta, unke kabhi-kabhaar ke yon sambandhon, ling kii parmparik bhoomika ke mandandon ke prati unka najariya, ek saptaah main televijan dekhne ke liye die jane vaale samay or maa se unke lagaav ke bare main jaanane kii koshish kii gai
 The study found that teenagers watch an average of 23 hours of television a week and spend more than three hours a day for it
 sabhi ladke or ladakiyon ne kaha ki maa se unka lagaav santushtijanak he
 Apparently, as the level of television viewing increases, especially in boys, the recreational attitude towards sex increases and this increases the sexual needs of men and leads to dominance stereotypes
 vahiin ladakiyon kaa unki maa se lagaav televijan ke is prabhaav ke liye pratirohak hota he
 The negative television programs shown about the sexual orientation towards men and the sexual craze of men have less impact on girls
 isse ulat ladakon kaa unki maa se jitna gaharaa lagaav hota he, un par televijan ke aise nakaaratmak kaaryakramon kaa prabhaav utana hi adhik hota he
 You will remember the incident of AAP government in Delhi when Kejriwal left his post and sat on hunger strike
 kejariwal ne dilli ke conot place main ek videshi mahila se hue gang rape ko lekar dilli police or grih mantralay ke khilaaf morcha khol diya tha
 At that time, Kejriwal was ridiculed on social media
 kejariwal ke liye vah daur itnaa bura tha ki unhone khud ko 'araajaktaavaadi' tak kah daalaa tha
 Well today this discussion is because today another CM has announced a hunger strike in his own reign
 ve koi or nahin kisaan andolan kii aanch main ghire madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan hai
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan announced on Friday evening that he will be on hunger strike from Saturday till the farmer agitation calms down and will go on indefinite fast
 shivaraj singh chouhan bhopal ke bhel dashahra maidan main anshan karenge
 He told that during this time he will not do any work in Ballabh Bhavan nor from CM House, he will also do his work from Dussehra ground
 apane bayaan main shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki mere upwas ke dauraan pradesh kaa koi kaamkaaj nahin rukegaa
 All the work of the government will be dealt with from Dussehra ground itself
 mere upwas ke dauraan kisaanon se charchaa ke sabhi raste khule rahenge
 The peasant movement is at its peak in Madhya Pradesh
 virdohi partiyaan bhi use bhunaane kii koshish main lagi hui hai
 In such a situation, this decision of the Chief Minister is peculiar
 raajnneetik jaankaron ke mutabik yah mandsaur hinsa ke baad paidaa hui jansamvednaa ko khinchne kaa jariya maatr he
 What time can Shivraj Singh Chauhan prove from his fast, what will be gained from this, only time will tell, but based on the interaction of some enlightened sections of Madhya Pradesh, this 'fast card' of Shivraj does not seem to have any special benefit
 
 ye ho sakate hai 'anshan card' ke sambhavit parinaam- or aakraamak hogi congresis baat kii tasdik shivaraj kii ghoshnaa ke turant baad congress ne kar di he
 The Congress has called it a gimmick
 pradesh congress adhyaksh arun yadav ne kaha ki mukhyamantri kisaanon kii samasyaayein dur karne ke bajaae upwas kii nautanki kar rahe hai
 If they have to do something, then go among the farmers and relieve their pain
 netaa pratipaksh ne kadi pratikriya dete hue kaha, "ek baar or mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan varsh 2011 main aisi hi nautanki karne ke liye bhel dashahra maidan main baithne vaale the
 When the constitutional crisis arose, he withdrew his step, by then the government had spent fifty lakh rupees on his gimmick system
 "- kahin or bighad na jaae halaatraajya main kisaan andolan charam par he
 The fire of violence has reached the state capital Bhopal
 aise main mukhyamantri kaa khud anshan par baith janaa sthiti ko thodaa bekaabu bhi kar saktaa he
 The Leader of Opposition also reminded the incident of 2011 when a 'constitutional crisis' ensued
 - narm ho sakate hai kisaanon ke tevarapradesh ke mukhyamantri ke kisaanon ke paksh main khud anshan par baithne kii baat se kisaan andolan thamane ke bhi asaar hai
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan's image among the people is much better
 aise main shuukravaar kii unki press conference main aag kii tapish kam karne main phydemand sabit ho sakati he
 - Shivraj's image may be weak Shivraj Singh has already made the record of holding the CM chair of Madhya Pradesh for the longest time
 aapako bataa den ki ve lagaataar teen baar madhya pradesh kii satta sambhaal chuke hai
 Elections are to be held again next year
 aise main shivaraj singh chouhan ke liye kisaan andolan kaaphi baari bhi pad saktaa he
 This 'fast card' of Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who describes himself as farmer friendly, is an attempt to save the same image
 - bijepi ko tamaam rajyon main nuksaan kii gunjaaishamandsaur main kisaanon par chali goliyaan or laathiyaan sirf madhya pradesh kii seemaa main nahin rukne vaali hai
 Obviously, this movement will challenge BJP in every state
 vipakshi dal ise mudda banaakar modi sarkaar ke saath-saath bijepi ko bhi nishaanaa banaaegi
 Admission in IIT for engineering studies is the dream of every student who wishes to go into this field
 vaise parivaar kii kamjor aarthik sthiti students kii raah or chaah main baadha jarur banati he, lekin manzil paane sachhee lagan or drudhnishchay ho, to kisi ke liye kuch bhi naammumkin nahin
 a similar example has been set by these selected students: Neeraj Jha of Madhubani district of Bihar has secured 1,217th rank in the IIT entrance examination this year
 niraj ke pita bhagwaan jha kolkata main taxi chaalak hai
 Neeraj said, 'the family's hard work is difficult with the money earned by father, in such a situation, by working hard day and night, he has raised money for children's education
 'niraj kaa kahana he ki vah ab or kadi mehnat se padhai karegaa badhiya rojgaar hasil kar or parivaar kii garibi dur karne main pitaaji kii sahaayta karegaa

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or uparajyapal ke bich jari adhikaron kii jang par supreme court ke faisle ke baad aam aadmi party ab janata kii adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataayegi
 Delhi state convenor Gopal Rai has announced a public movement before the Lok Sabha elections, accusing the central government and LG of discriminating against Delhi
 aam aadmi party ne 2019 chunaav ke liye 3 lakshya bhi tay kiye hai
 This includes winning all the seats of Delhi, forming a government of Grand Alliance inside the center and giving Delhi full state status
 gopal raay ne somvaar ko kaha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja na milane kii vajah se dilli kii janata ke saath jo anyaay ho rahaa he uske samaadhaan ke liye aam aadmi party ne centre sarkaar se lekar court tak kaa darwaja khatkhataya lekin nyaay nahin mila
 Now the party has come to the conclusion that it will go to the people's court
 AAP ne ginaae dilli sarkaar ke saath kiye jane vaale anyaay1
 Why the cost of Delhiites' vote is half the cost of votes of other states? 2
 dilliwaale sava lakh karod tex har saal dete hai lekin centre dilli ko sava teen sau karod vaapis detii he, kyon?3
 There is chaos like an epidemic in Delhi, new universities are not allowed in Delhi, why? 4
 dilli main noujvaan berozegaar hai, 3 lakh se zyada post dilli sarkaar main khaali hai, 70 fisadi sarkaar or rojgaar thap he, yuvaaon ke saath anyaay kyon?5
 Government elected from Delhi Police cannot ask questions
 puri dilli main suraksha ko lekar ek inch sudhaar nahin hua
 Is LG no accountability to the public? 6
 transfar posting bhi dilli sarkaar ke paas nahin, isse afasaron kii bhartee nahin ho paa rahi he, ek maheene ke sarkari kaam main saal guzar jate hai kyonki afasar sunate nahin, kyon?7
 Why do the people of Delhi have to join hands in front of the center for their land? 8
 janalokapal bill vidhansabha main paas kar centre ko bheja, aakhir kyon kanoon nahi banane diya ja rahaa he?9
 Why is injustice to Delhi people by snatching ACB? Whereas corruption was reduced in 49 days

 The Chief Minister of Delhi holds a sit-in at the LG House, but LG does not meet the Chief Minister even once, why? The goal of our movement will be: 👉 Delhi gets full statehood

 Input: IANS chini technology company shaomi ne bharat main apane pehle ofline ritel store Mi Home kii shuruyaat kii he
 Firstly it has been started in Bangalore and the company will open 200 offline stores in India in the next 2 years
 pehle dilli or mumbai jaise metro shaharon se isaki shuruyaat kii jaaegi
 It will be opened for public from May 20 and pre-booking will be done for this
 ye he Mi Home kii khaas batelaunch ke dauraan shaomi ke vaais president or managing diarector manu kumaar jain ne kaha he ki ise Mi Store nahin balki Mi Home kehane ke peeche ek vajah he
 He said that no customer will be asked at this store why that shop has come
 Mi Home main koi get nahin hoga or yahaan log aa kar ghanton products dekh sakate hai or inhen yuj kar sakate hai
 Giving the example of China's Mi Home, he said that at some stores there, customers come and make rice and the children keep playing games for 6 hours
 iske alaava unhone yah bhi kaha he ki is store main aakar wifai yuj kar sakate hai, coffee pi sakate hai or koi disturb bhi nahin karegaa
 However, there are not as many products in Mi Home in India as there are in China
 yahaan graahakon ko smartfones or kuch accessories se lekar air purifire tak kharidne ko milenge
 Will Mi Home increase market share? After online, now the company's offline strategy will cause its market share to increase
 jawaab saaf he, agar uplabdhta badi to aisa hoga
 Like online, if the out-of-stock starts to happen in offline stores, then the company may not get any special benefit
 dayera badha kar produkats main karnaa hoga ijaphaphayda tab hoga jab company store kaa dayera badhayegi
 In addition to smartphones and a few accessories in Mi Home of China and other countries, many products are available
 lekin bhartiya bazaar ke liye philhalane products kaa elaan nahin hua he
 One of the reasons behind bringing fewer products to India is that many of the company's goods such as water purifiers are not made according to the Indian customer, so it may prove difficult to sell them in India
 kaaphi chota he yah Mi homekampani kaa pehla Mi ofline store spes ke maamle main kaaphi chota he
 Obviously the products sold in it will also be limited
 gauratlab he ki shaomi ko bharat main apana retail store kholane kaa license nahin he
 However the company has applied for it
 philhal companytoni Home kii shuruyaat kar di he jo frenchijake tahat kaam karegaa jise apratyaksh rup se Xiaomi hi chalaaegi
 It will be interesting to see how the company competes with Chinese companies- Vivo and Oppo in India using this store
 kyonki agar baat ofline maujuudagi kii karen to vivo or oppo lagaataar aakraamak marketing se duusare ko maat detii dikh rahi hai

 'mallika-e-ghazal' is Padmabhushan Begum Akhtar's birthday today
 agar is maukey par unki gajalon ke pasamanjar main unhen yaad na kiya jaae, to khuda kii kasam badi nafarmani hogi
 Shakeel Badauni's 'aye Muhabbat Tere Anjaam Pe Rona Aaya' is one of the most famous ghazals of Akhtari Bai
 7 oktober, 1914 ko uttar pradesh ke faijabad main rahane vaale ek kuleen parivaar main us aawaaj ne janm liya
 The parents lovingly named it 'bibbi'
 bibbi ko sangeet se ishk hua 7 saal kii umr main, jab usne theatre abhinetri chanda kaa gaanaa suna
 He was initiated into classical music by the famous music of that time, Ustad Ata Muhammad Khan, Abdul Wahid Khan and Ustad Jhande Khan of Patiala Gharana

 The words of this ghazal were, 'tune bute e harjai tune bute harjai, something like this, i would see your face every scene
 ' ghazal khatm kar vah aakhir main vah ek kishor hadabdaahat ke saath kahati hai, 'meraa naam akhtari bai faijabad'bibbi bahut jald samaan adhikaar se ghazal, thumari, tappa, daadaraa or khyaal gane lageen
 Later, Hindustan called him 'mallika-e-ghazal' and conferred with Padma Bhushan
 hindustan main shastreey raagon par aadhaarit ghazal gayaki ko oonchaaiyon par pahunchane kaa sehara akhtari bai ke sir hi bandhana chahie
 'make me crazy if you have to
 
 ',' Do not call the cuckoo, start calling the dagger
 
 Songs like 'chha Rahi Ghat Jiya Mora Lehraaya Hai' are among his famous songs
 unki gayaki jahaan ek ore chanchalta or shokhi bhari thi, vahiin duusari ore usamen shastreeyta or dil ko chhu lene vaali gaharaaiyaan bhi thim
 His voice is unmatched because of his great elasticity in voice, pigmentation, and his ability to color the canvas of expression with infinite colors

 This desire made him meet barrister Ishtiaq Ahmed Abbasi in Lucknow
 yah mulaakaat jald nikaah main badal gai or iske saath hi akhtari bai, begum akhtar ho gayi, lekin iske baad saamaajik bandhanon kii vajah se begum sahiba ko gaanaa chhodana padaa
 Inayat of the world broke his heart

 Sarojini Naidu and classical singer Pandit Jasraj were great admirers of hers, so Kaifi Azmi was also mesmerized by listening to her ghazals in the voice of Begum Sahiba
 1974 main begum akhtar ne apane janmdin ke maukey par caphi azmi kii yah ghazal gaai
 'hear me, my dear, they are so strange to them, all strangers are here, who knows whom? It was like leaving a cow, like a fish living without water
 ve kareeb paanch saal tak nahin ga sakin or biimaar rahane lageen
 This was the time when her return to music proved to be beneficial to her declining health and she returned to the recording studio in 1949
 unhone lakhanu radio stesan main teen ghazal or ek daadaraa gaaya
 After this, tears came out of his eyes and he turned to music seminars
 yah silsilaa dobaaraa shuru hua, to phir kabhi nahin rukaa
 My humphus, my human, do not trick me into being a friend

 bhartiya janata party or congress donon hi marathon baithkon ke jariye daavedaaron ke naam par raishumaari kar rahi hai
 Meanwhile, the process of holding the hand of the Congress by Manvendra Singh, who has left the BJP, is also seen reaching the final stages
 media reports main daawa he ki maanavendra 17 oktober ko laav-lashkar ke saath congress main shaamil ho sakate hai
 However, it is different that he will try his hand in national politics instead of the state
 bijepi ke varisht netaa or purv kendriya mantrijaswant singhke bete maanavendra singh philhal shiv vidhansabha seat se vidhayak hai
 Manvendra coming from the Rajput society is expected to make a big change in the politics of western Rajasthan by joining the Congress
 is ilaake main rajput paramparaagat rup se bijepi ke voter rahe hai, aise main rajput voter badi sankhya main congress se jud sakate hai
 Wife of Chitra Singh Singh can contest: Manavendra Singh's family has been dominated in Badmer
 wo khud barmer-jaisalmer loksabhaa kshetra se saansad nirvaachit hue hai
 In 1999, Manvendra contested the Lok Sabha elections for the first time from this seat, although he did not win
 iske baad 2004 main shining india kaa naaraa fail hone ke baavjood maanavendra singh barmer-jaisalmer loksabhaa seat se chunaav jeet gaye
 In the 2013 assembly elections, Manvendra Singh tried his luck on the BJP ticket from Shiva seat of Barmer and he won
 lekin 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main jab unke pita jaswant singh ko bijepi se tikat nahin mila to unki duuri bijepi se bad gai
 Now that Manvendra Singh is supposed to go to Congress, the discussion is that wife Chitra Singh will contest from her seat
 active huin chitra singhbarmer ke pachapadara main 22 sitambar ko bulaai 'swabhimaan raily' maanavendra singh ne bijepi ko badi bhul bataate hue sab kuch spasht kar diya tha
 But before this rally, Manvendra's wife Chitra Singh was seen to be active in public
 swabhimaan raily se pehle barmer main yuva aakrosh raily ke dauraan chitra singh ne ghunghat ke peeche se kaha tha ki aisi sarkaar ko ukhaad phenko, jo swabhimaan kii raksha nahin karti he
 He pointed out Vasundhara Raje's Rajasthan Gaurav Yatra
 iske alaava bhi chitra singh kai morchon par khulkar apane vichaar rakh rahi hai
 Jaswant Singh, father of Manvendra's father, Union Minister Manvendra Singh, has been one of the founding members of the BJP
 jaswant singh sabase zyada saansad rahane vaale netaaon main shumaar kiye jate hai
 He has been a Lok Sabha MP four times, while he has served as a Rajya Sabha MP five times
 lekin 2014 ke chunaav main party ne unhen tikat nahin diya, jiske peeche vasundhara raaje ko vajah mana gaya
 Though Jaswant Singh and CM Vasundhara Raje had a very good relationship at first, there was a distance between the two in the last seven-eight years
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne barmer se jasamvat singh ko tikat dene ke bajaay karnal sonaaram choudhary ko maidan main utaara
 Jaswant Singh contested elections independently after not getting a ticket from BJP
 modi lahar ke baavjood jaswant singh 4 lakh se zyada vot paane main kaamyaab rahe the, haalanki vah jeet nahin paae the
 Manvendra refused to campaign against his father and in favor of BJP candidate Sonaram Chaudhary in this election
 jiskaa nateeja unhen party se said line karne ke rup main jhelana padaa
 It is now discussed that Manvendra Singh will not contest the assembly elections but can contest the Lok Sabha elections from Barmer next year
 ab tak maanavendra singh ke group ko paanch siton ke aavanton ke daawey kiye ja rahe hai
 Among them, his wife Chitra is expected to fight Shiva seat
 jabaki rashtriya raajnneeti kii pita ki viraasat ko maanavendra singh aage badhayenge

 During the hearing in the Supreme Court, Justice Rohinton Nariman told lawyer ML Sharma what do you want Sharma? Should we cancel the entire Lok Sabha election? The Supreme Court refused to hear the petition, making strict remarks
 vakil emel sharma kii yachika main iviem kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthaate hue kaha gaya he ki chunaav ayog ko ye adhikaar hi nahin he ki wo iviem ke zarie chunaav karaae
 Sharma argues that according to the Representation of the People Act, the Commission can conduct elections only through ballot paper

 This move demolished the government itself

 24 november ko jab mantrimandal kii baithak main khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh ko anumati dene kaa faisla liya gaya tha, tab congress ek vibhajit gharaane kii haalat main thi
 In the meeting, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee made the strongest arguments in favor of allowing FDI in retail in the current era
 unka tark ekadam sidhaa-sa tha
 He is said to have said, "I need money
" ''mukherjee bharat kii dhimi padati vikaas dar, videshi puunji ke palaayan, bazaar main mandi or rupye kii keemat main giravat ko lekar chintit rahe hai
 Something had to be done to turn this slippery in the opposite direction

 But the government's hopes were shattered in the face of political reality

 The Congress, backed only by the Nationalist Congress Party, is stuck

 With strong opposition, the government was able to achieve only a short time

 On behalf of the government which presents itself as farmers friendly, the slowness in mobilizing support from farmers for a decision that benefits the farmers is surprising
 dilli sthit ek swatantra think-tanks - indian counsingl for research on international iconamik relations (isiariiaar), ne 2008 main kiye gaye ek adhyayan main is baat ko rekhaankit kiya tha ki sangathit khudara vyapaar se kisaanon ko acha khaasaa laabh hoga
 Another survey conducted by a cauliflower community in Hoskote, on the outskirts of Bangalore, showed that farmers received an average 25 per cent higher price when they sold directly to retailers than government-controlled mandis
 sangathit khudara vikritaon ko bechney vaale kisaanon ko bank se bhi karj milane kii zyada sambhaavna pai gai
 Few groups of farmers have been supporting FDI in retail for some time
 desh bhar main ek lakh sadasyon vaale gairrajanatik kisaan sanghathan bharat krishak samaaj ke adhyaksh ajay jakhad ne khudara kshetra main epadi ko ijaajat dene ke paksh main tark dete hue agast main pradhanmantri ko likhaa tha, ''sabji mandiyon main bichauliyon, kamishan agenton or khudara bazaar main galiyon main bechney waalon or sabji vikritaon kii nijee mandaliyon kaa ekadhikaar chalata he
 
 
 The farmer is forced to sell his produce at the time of harvesting (as vegetables perish quickly)
 
 Despite this, when it comes to creating guidelines for FDI in multi-brand retail, the government begins to wonder how to protect the rights of the same circles from competition from large-sized stores
 ''jakhad un dalon kii aalochana karte hai, jo khudara kshetra main epadi ke virodh main hai
 He says, "the parties who are opposing the government's decision are only expressing their concern for the grocery store owners
 is bare main koi chintit najar nahin aata ki agar kisaanon kii upaj bade khudara vikritaon ke jariye sidhi kharidi jaati he, to unhen kitna laabh hoga
 "congress could easily mobilize the support of farmers in favor of its policy
" lekin usne aisa nahin kiya
 Rajiv Kumar, general secretary of FICCI, a union of industries, is surprised by the controversy
 ve kehete hai, 'huekmaatr sawaal kiraanaa storon ke hashr ko lekar he or koi saboot nahin he ki unhen nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 "the study of ICRIER, conducted by Kumar as the CEO of this think-tank at the time, shows that where some of the grocery stores close to the major retailers have to suffer a short-term revenue loss, in the long run The effect is negligible
 rajeev kumaar kehete hai, ''kiraanaa store maalikon ko puri ummid he ki ve bade retailleron ko pratiyogita main parajeet kar denge
 Two-thirds of the people say that they want to see their children in this business too
 ''bharat main sangathit retaillers kaa anubhav kumaar ke siddhant kaa samarthan karata he
 At least one large chain, Subhiksha, which had more than 1,000 stores, came to a halt within 12 years of starting operations
 yahaan tak ki mukesh ambani jaisaa safal vyavsaayee bhi apni reliance retail chen se kiraanaa storon par koi asar daal sakane main vifal rahaa
 It can be said as unfortunate that the government failed to respond to the hype created by some select business organizations

 kiraanaa storon kii suvidhaayen unhen dhandhe main banaae rakhengi
 Sabharwal believes that allowing FDI in retail can make a qualitative difference in India's employment

 co / 2f3ty294aa The Tibetan cleric Dalai Lama has instructed China to choose his successor
 unhone kaha ki mere uttaradhikari kaa faisla china nahin kar saktaa kyonki yah uske kshetradhikaar main nahin aata he
 The Dalai Lama said that the people of Tibet will decide my successor
 bataa den ki is maamle par bharat or china ke bich tanatani rahi he
 Recently, China had said that the decision of the Dalai Lama's successor should be made in China and India's intervention on this issue cannot be accepted
 china agle dalai lamas ko niyukt main koi aadhyatmik prakriya shaamil nahin karnaa chahta, vahiin duusari ore tibetiyon ke aadhyatmik netaa dalai lamas ko paaramparik rup se chunaa jaataa he, jisamen aadhyatmik prakriya shaamil hoti he
 According to the current Dalai Lama (84), the process of choosing his successor will begin in the year 2025 when he turns 90
 dalai lamas ne apane ek bayaan main kaha tha ki raajnneetik tareeke se chune gaye ummidavaar ko koi manyata nahin di jaani chahie, jisamen china ganraajya ke log bhi shaamil hai
 Although the Dalai Lama has not clarified all the procedures to be held to choose his successor, scholars state that his body holds (rebirth) with prayers and tantric rituals is sought in Buddhist monasteries
 is baar chune jane vaale 15wein dalai lamas kaa chayan unke 14 purvavarti dalai lamaaon ke vipareet hoga, kyonki unka chayan us samay hoga jab unke purvavarti (unase pehle us pad par rahane vaale) abhi bhi jivit honge

 Tabu has done a good acting, but Ajay Devgn is not very involved in this role, and in the case of acting, he is seen out somewhere
 kul milakar unki acting bahut hi everej rahi he
 It can also be said that they seem misfit somewhere in this role, the direction of 'de De Pyaar De' is very weak and the story is also derailed

 Against the increasing atrocities on women in Madhya Pradesh, the state unit of Congress is starting a 'nyaya Yatra' from Udaipura in Raisen district today
 yah yatra us gaanv se shuru ho rahi he, jahaan rajya sarkaar main mantri rampal singh kii putravadhu priti raghuvanshi ne aatmahatya kii thi
 The Congress has decided to take out this yatra with a view to bring about public awareness by making the issue of increasing atrocities on women in the state

 Under the leadership of Smt

 com / ttmggkg0if— Madhya Pradesh Mahila Congress (@mppmc)april 3, 2018pradeshdhyaksh yadav kaa kahana he ki rajya main jab mantri kii putravadhu ko hi nyaay nahin mil rahaa he to anya mahilaon or yuvatiyon ko kitna nyaay mil paa rahaa hoga
 This is the question which Shivraj Singh Chauhan should answer
 ghatana ko lagbhag ek pakhwada guzar gaya he or ab tak police ne prakaran hi darj nahin kiya he
 Leader Pratipaksha Singh said, "after this two-day visit, Nyaya Yatra will be taken out from April 16 across the state
 rashtriya aparaadh anveshan beuro (enciarabi) ke aankade rajya main mahila atyaacharon kii kahani bayaan karne vaale hai
 "according to the information given by the Congress, this Nyay Yatra, starting from Udaipura, will reach Bhopal on Friday and end
 is maukey par ikbaal maidan main ek jansabha hogi
 Significantly, this issue may be big for the Shivraj government, which has been surrounded by the issue of giving the status of political status to saints in the state
 bharat ke niryaat sector main pichley chaar saal(2014-18) main ausat vruddhi dar kitni rahi he? 0

 From there we subtract 0

 This is not my analysis
 financial express ke sampadak sunil jain kaa he
 He says that China ranked 1st between 2014-18
 5 pratishat prati varsh kii dar se vruddhi kii he
 Taking advantage of this, Vietnam is fast gaining its place in this sector
 vietnam kaa niryaat 13 pratishat salanaa dar se bad rahaa he
 In 1990, Vietnam was able to export only 13 percent of what India exported
 aaj bharat ke niryaat ke 75 fisadi ke baraabar vietnam niryaat karata he
 Vietnam is a smaller country than India
 sunil jain likhte hai ki jaldi hi vietnam niryaat ke maamle main bharat ko overtek kar legaa
 When China adopted the policy of leaving the textile sector in the high-value products segment, Bangladesh and Vietnam came up quickly to fill this empty space
 agar aap bijness kii khabaren padhate honge tab dhyaan hoga ki kai saal pehle modi sarkaar ne textile sector ke liye 6000 karod ke package kaa elaan kiya tha
 Till date India's textile sector has not recovered
 textile rojgaar dene vaale sectoron main se ek rahaa he
 In June 2016, while announcing the package, the Modi cabinet had said that in the next three years i
e
 by 2019, 1 crore jobs will be created in the textile sector and an investment of 75,000 crores
 tathy aap pataa kar len, aapako niraashaa haath lagegi

 The smart phone business in the world is worth 300 billion dollars

 Vietnam's share in this global export is 10 percent
 jabaki bharat kii hissedari naganya he
 In 2010, Vietnam produced only 4 percent of the mobile phone India produced
 aaj vietnam kahaan he or bharat kahaan he
 Most of the mobile phones in India are assembled, not produced
 kal purze kaa aayaat hota he or phir yahaan jod-jaad kar phone banataa he

 modi sarkaar aarthik morche par fail sarkaar he
 This is his sixth year
 ek bhi sector aisa nahin he jise vah apni kamyaabi ke rup main pradarshit kar sake
 Textile is in bad shape
 mobile kaa aap dekh hi rahe hai or automobil thapp he
 Banks are at a peak
 beshak modi sarkaar raajnneetik rup se safal sarkaar he
 Further issues like unemployment also prove to be bogus
 notebandi jaisaa bogus kadam bhi modi sarkaar kii prachand raajnneetik safalata kii aad main sahi ho jaataa he
 This is the reason that after losing the election, the opposition is moving to BJP in search of their employment
 vipaksh ko pataa he ki raajnneeti bachaani he to bijepi main chalo kyonki janata naukari, pension, bachat ganvaa kar bhi bijepi ko hi vot karne vaali he
 i myself have seen that people do not even talk about the Modi government even after losing their jobs and not getting it
 aisi raajnneetik safalata kam hi netaa ko hasil hoti he
 Hence unemployment is a bogus issue
 note- kya is tarah kii khabaren aapako hindi akhbaaron main milti hai? aap vot jise den magar in karaab hindi akhbaaron ko jaldi padhanaa chhod den
 They do not have the ability to take you forward
 inke sampadak ab huzur ke ji-huzur ho gaye hai
 You take data from newspaper money and have fun

 Rajasthan: Is BJP a victim of factionalism? The veteran Agarshahpuravidhan Sabha constituency is not seen on one platform
 Shahpura also has the dominance of Rao Rajendra Singh of BJP, who is continuously winning

 According to the statement, this concession (subsidy) should be used to balance education resources between urban and rural areas

 mahanagar dandadhikari vandana ne ek vyakti ko apane bete kii dekharekh ke liye 7500 rupee dene kaa nirdesh diya
 The court found that the child's age in chronology is 17 years, but his social age is 9 to 10 years
 dandadhikari ne apane aadesh main kaha he, 'maine ise yah ullekh karne laayak paaya he ki swarozgaar karne vaale yaa asangathit kshetra main niojit log kabhi bhi apni asli aamadani nahin bataate hai
 'this decision was given last week, but it has been issued on Friday

 19 July in 19 states of the country - Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal
 The survey was conducted between 23 July

 When asked the people involved in this survey, their biggest concern was, 27% people took unemployment, 20% corruption, while 19% people named inflation
 iske alaava chah-chah fisadi logon ne mahila suraksha or kisaanon kii samasya, to chaar-chaar fisadi logon ne aatankwaad or notebandi ko chintaa kaa vishay qaraar diya
