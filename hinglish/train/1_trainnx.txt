 neshnal cemple survey (NSSO) kii report ke mutabik abhi bhi 28 fisadi se zyada gramin ilaake main log khule main shouch karne ko majaboor hai

 3 fisadi gramin gharon or 96
 2 percent of urban households have toilets
 lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi daawa kar chuke hai ki bharat khule main shouch se mukt ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, the question arises that the remaining 28 in rural India
 7 phisadi log shauchalay ke liye kahaan jate hai?ghar main shauchalay nahin, khule main shouch ko majaboor logis sawaal ke jawaab main 'ajtak' kii team pahunchi madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal se sate sihor ke thunakalan or thunakhurd gaanv

 afridi disambar main yuai main prastaavit bharat-paak ke bich dwipaksheeya siries ko lekar lahore main patrakaron se charchaa kar rahe the
 He said that the PCB should instead focus on inviting other teams to visit Pakistan
 tippaniyan Afridi said, 'I don't think we need to give so much importance to playing with India
 meri samaj main nahin aata ki ham siries khilne ke liye hameshaa unke saamne kyon gidgidaate hai
 If they don't want to play, then why do we need to show that we are desperate to play with them
 ' Significantly, India and Pakistan have not played any bilateral series since 2007, except for a limited overs series in 2012-13
 donon tiimon ke bich 2015 se 2023 tak chah siries khilne kaa qaraar hua he
 Afridi was discussing with reporters in Lahore about the proposed indo-pak bilateral series in the UAE in December
 unhone kaha ki pisibi ko iske sthaan par anya tiimon ko pakistan daure ke liye aamantrit karne par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie
 The comments afridi ne kaha, 'mujhe nahin lagata ki hamen bharat se khilne ko itnaa adhik mahatv dene kii jarurat he
 i do not understand why we always beg him to play the series
 yadi ve nahin khelnaa chaahate hai, to phir hamen yah jataane kii kya jarurat he ki ham unase khilne ke liye betaab hai
 ' gauratlab he ki bharat or pakistan ne 2007 ke baad 2012-13 main simit overon kii ek siries ko chhodkar koi dwipaksheeya siries nahin kheli he

 According to Steve Forbes, this gross act of the Indian government is also immoral, because currency is something that represents the things people make
 mudra bilkul vaisaa hi vaada hoti he, jaisaa koi cinema yaa kaarykram main shaamil tikat hoti he, jo aapako seat milane kii guarantee detii he
 Such resources produce people, not governments
 jo bharat ne kiya he, vah logon kii sampatti kii bahut bade paimaane par chori he, jo loktantric tareeke se chuni hui sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye hone kii vajah se zyaada chaunkaati he
 If something like this had happened in a country like Venezuela, it might not have come as a surprise
 or isse bhi koi hairaani nahin hoti ki sarkaar is sachai ko chipa rahi he ki is ek kadam se ek hi jatke main dasiyon arab dollar kaa nuksaan hone ja rahaa he
 Now the work that India must do to become a global powerhouse is to reduce the income and business tax rates, and simplify the entire tax structure, make the rupee a currency as powerful as Swiss franc, and reduce the rules To reduce the cost, so that new business can be started in a few minutes without any cost
 ab bharat ko global powerhouse banane ke liye jo kaam nishchit rup se karnaa chahie, vah he inkam tathaa bijnes tex kii daron ko gata de, or samooche tex dhaanche kaa sarleekaran kare, rupee ko swiss frank jitani shaktishaalee mudra bana de, or niyamon ko kam se kam kar de, taaki bina kisi laagat ke bhi kuch hi minuton main nayaa vyapaar shuru kiya ja sake
 Digambar Jain Munitrun Sagarka died on Saturday morning
 51 saal kii umr main unhone antim saans lee
 He had jaundice
 jain muni apane pravachanon ke lekar charchaa main rahete the
 He had been suffering from jaundice for several days, due to which he became very weak
 bataa den, jain muni ne ilaaj karaane se bhi inkaar kar diya tha
 Jain monk Tarun Sagar was Ekadigambaramuni
 ek intervyuu main unhone kaha tha- main nagn rahata hum or digambar avasthaa main rahata hum
 It is important for the world to understand what is the end of Digambar Muni? Learn - How are Digambar Munizan Dharma divided into two parts
 digambar or shwetambar
 One who wears white clothes and one who is naked
 jo nirvastr hote hai vah digambar he
 It is said that in this religion people have to take food in their hand
 media reports ke anusaar jab digambar muni buudhe ho jate hai or khadey hokar bhojan nahin kar pate hai to is avasthaa main ye log ann- jal kaa tyaag kar dete hai
 Please tell, standing food in this religion is considered to be the specialty of this religion
 manyata ye bhi he ki is dharm ke log jameen ke neeche ugane vaali subjiyan nahin khate hai ye keval unheen subjiyon kaa seven karte hai jo jameen ke upar ugti he
 How to live Digambar Munidigambar Jain sages believe that there is no fault in their mind and life, so there is no nappy on the body
 unka maananaa he aam log kapade pahante hai lekin digbanr muni chaaron dishaao ke kapadon ke rup main pahan lete hai
 He says that there is no better dress than nudity in the world
 vastra to vikaron ko dhakne ke liye hote he
 What is the need of clothes for such a baby and saint who is beyond the vices

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi keeps talking about making the country clean from time to time
 isi muhim ke tahat unhone deshavaasiyon ko khule main shouch na karne kaa sankalp bhi dilaayaa he
 The extent to which PM Modi is serious about cleanliness can be understood from the fact that he mentioned it in his speech till August 15 and his picture of sweeping himself in Delhi's Valmiki Nagar was in the headlines

 You may have heard the praise of Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni many times from fellow players, but rarely heard from the mouth of coach Duncan Fletcher
 flechar ne BCCI
 In the TV interview, Dhoni has been described as a 'very honest' and 'stubborn' captain
 flechar ne dhoni ke bare main kaha, 'vah ek leader kii tarah team kii aguwai karata he
 When he comes to bat under pressure, he is very good
 wo sabase pehle aise maukon par saamne aata he or kahata he ki main ye karne ja rahaa hum
 Now you guys just have to carry it forward
 maine kai captainon ko dekha he jo sahi paristhitiyon main achche leaders hote hai
 But the way Dhoni fights in difficult situations is great
 'dhoni ke saath apni pehali mulaakaat ke bare main flechar ne kaha, 'dhoni aise insaan hai jiske saath koi bhi aasaani se ghul-mil jaataa he
 i met him for the first time when i was to join the team in Mumbai for the West Indies series
 main lucky hum ki mujhe aisa captain mila
 Dhoni never makes any assumptions about anyone in advance and makes an opinion about someone only after talking
 'flechar ke kaarykaal main team india ko mushkil samay se bhi guzarana padaa he
 Regarding this, Fletcher said, 'there was no difference in our relationship even at the time of defeat
 jab aap bure daur se guzarate ho to aap kisi insaan kaa asli cheharaa dekhte hai
 Dhoni is a captain who does not get excited at the time of victory and is very calm under pressure, which is also very important
 'flechar ne kaha, 'dhoni bahut ziddee captain he or uski opinian badalanaa bahut mushkil he
 i don't see any harm in it
 mujhe to lagata he ki ek captain ko aisa hi hona chahie
 a good captain makes stubborn decisions over right rather than stubborn decisions

 Is this Chinese proverb going to be the specialty of the second innings started by Narendra Modi recently? Or will Modi and Amit Shah prove it wrong? It cannot be that two very strong personalities lead the country
 duniya ke tamaam diggaj netaaon ne is kahawat kaa arth janaa he, bhale hi ve iske chini mul se parichit na hon
 Xi Jinping, whose speeches are full of quotes from Chinese classic and folk tales, knows this
 rus ke vladimir putin, turki ke recep taiyap erdogan or saudi arab ke mohammad bin salmaan bhi janate hai
 Prime Minister Modi would certainly know this too
 unke gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main teen kaarykaal or south block kaa pehla kaarykaal iske liye paryaapt he
 However, something untoward has happened in the first fortnight of his second term
 kal subah khabar ai ki pradhanmantri ne do mahatvapurn cabinet cametiyaan gathit kii hai- ek nivesh or aarthik vruddhi ke liye or duusari rojgaar or kaushal vikaas ke liye
 This decision was welcomed everywhere
 antat: iskaa matlab to yahi tha ki modi sarkaar ne congress dwaara chunaav prachaar ke dauraan jorshor se kahi gai vah baat sweekaar karne main teji dikhaai ki - arthvyavastha mandi kii chapet main he (pichhali timahi main jidipi kii vruddhi dar 2019 ke purvanumaan se ek pratishat se adhik neeche girakar 5
 8%) and unemployment reached an all-time high (the Labor Ministry finally admitted that unemployment was at its highest in the past 45 years)
 haalanki, is ghoshnaa ke jariye die gaye raajnneetik sanket main kuch asaamaanya tha
 The new home minister of the Modi government, Amit Shah, was included in both the committees, even though his home ministry portfolio has no direct connection to the two panels on the economy
 duusari taraf, grih mantralay se raksha mantralay main bheje gaye rajnath singh kaa naam in donon samitiyon main gaayab tha
 The omission of Rajnath Singh's name in another important committee was more shocking - the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs, which is the most important for the overall functioning of the government after the Cabinet Security Committee
 raksha mantri ke rup main unhen swaabhaavik rup se suraksha sambandhi cabinet samiti main jagah mili, prachlit vyavastha ke anusaar grih mantri bhi isamen hai
 But the appearance of the new cabinet panels clearly shows that Shah has stolen her 'limelight' from them
 ab shah kaa adhikaar modi ke 'new india' ke raajnneetik or aarthik donon kshetron main dikhaai degaa
 It is also certain that even after being removed from the post of BJP President, he will continue to dominate the party in the second place after Modi
 raksha mantri rajnath singh kaa naam pehle sirf do cabinet samitiyon main tha, baad main anya kai samitiyon main joda gaya
 Suddenly there has been speculation in political and media circles in the country: does this mean that Meidi 2
 0 main rajnath singh kaa demoshan ho gaya? kya iskaa yah bhi arth he ki nai modi sarkaar main amit shah kaa vastav main do number ke rup main 'abhishek' ho gaya he, is tathy ko bhi andekha karte hue ki 30 may ko raashtrapati bhawan main pradhanmantri ke baad rajnath singh ne shapath lee thi?atakalbaaji kisi bhi sanghathan main ek sanksharak agent hota he, jo ki sarkaar ke sheersh str par sabase adhik dekhne ko miltaa he
 This creates doubt within, confusion outside
 rasta chalate nae vichaaron or kalpanaaon ke judane par yah kaanaafoosee ko janm detii he or teji se bade str par viral ho jaati he
 That is why no supreme leader allows the birth and propagation of speculations and rumors
 modi ke pehle kaarykaal ke saraahneey pahaluon main se ek yah tha ki usamen unki shakti sanrachana ke saamanjasy ke bare main kisi bhi tarah kii atakalon ko koi gunjaaish nahin di gai
 He had the only voice that mattered
 is baat kii charchaa kabhi nahin hui ki unki sarkaar main number do koun he, kyonki koi number do nahin tha
 Is the style of functioning of the Modi government going to change now? It is too early to tell
 haalanki, shuruaati sanket yahi hai ki kuch chijen - shaayad, kuch bahut hi mahatvapurn chijen - agle paanch varshon main badal sakati hai
 Amit Shah will be widely seen as the vice captain in the new team Modi, as he was in fact unquestionably Modi's 'deputy' during the election campaign
 sangh parivaar ke bheetar hi nahin, balki unke aalochakon (jo unki aakraamak sampradayik raajnneeti se ghrinaa karte hai) ne bhi bhaajapa kii chunaav main jeet ke liye shah ke bahut bade yogadan ko vinamrata ke saath sweekaar kiya he
 In a panel discussion on NDTV, a clever Janata Dal (united) leader Pawan Verma suggested that Modi should appoint Shah as deputy prime minister
 atakalein pehle hi shuru ho gai hai ki shah 2024 main modi ke uttaradhikari ban sakate hai, kuch aisa hi unki shaareerik bhashaa or unke prati media ke ravaiye se bhi sanket miltaa he
 Amit Shah, PM Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh at the swearing-in ceremony in Rashtrapati Bhavan
 asal sawaal yahi he ki kya modi or shah china kii us kahawat ko maanane se inkaar karte hue kah sakate hai ki "van mountain can tu tigers
 "modi himself may have been deliberately grooming Shah as his trusted deputy
 yah bhi sambhav he ki modi apane puraane vishwaasapatro ke liye prashasan or raajnneetik prabandhan ke duniyavi pahaluon ko chhodana chaahate hon or kuch ranneetik lakshyon par apni urja kendrit karnaa chaahate hon
 In the absence of facts and reliable indications, there is no point in speculating that Modi 2
 0 kaise aage badhegi
 However, one fact is before us
 kuch puraani samitiyon ke punargathan ke alaava do nai cabinet samitiyon ke gathan ko lekar modi sarkaar ko aswabhaavik rup se jhatka laga he
 The Indian Express has expressed it well in its banner headline today - "all in a day's work: Morning order omits Rajnath from key panels, he's in by night"
 desh ko nahin pataa ki subah se raat ke bich vastav main kya hua, lekin sarkaar ne apni adhisuchana badal di or chaar cabinet cametiyon main raksha mantri ko shaamil kar liya
 Thus, apart from the Committees on Security and Economic Affairs, Rajnath Singh has now become a member of the Committees of Political Affairs, Parliamentary Affairs, Investment and Development, and Employment and Skill Development
 ab, isse ulat dekhen
 Amit Shah, whose ministerial experience at the center is only eight days old from today (7 June), is present in eight cabinet committees
 koun inkaar kar saktaa he ki ve rashtriya rajdhani ke pahaad par tiger number 2 hai, jise raisina hill kaha jaataa he? Children birth on New Year day On the first day of the new year, most children in the world have probably been born in India

 According to UNICEF, the first child of the first day of 2019 was probably born in Fiji and the last in the US
 unicef kii bharat pratinidhi yasmine ali haq ne kaha, 'nae saal ke din ke saath hamen yah sankalp lenaa chahie ki har ladke or ladki ke har haq ko puraa karenge, isaki shuruyaat uske astitv ke adhikaar se kii ja sakati he

 com / tetr4frgc7 In front of Arvind Kejriwal, an Aam Aadmi Party MLA called Kumar Vishwas on the night of 30 April
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne khud suna, vishwaas khulaasa karte hai ki vah party pramukh ke rup main padbhaar sanbhaalane ko taiyaar the
 He said that he was accompanied by then minister Kapil Mishra and 33 other mlas
 yah sankhya party ke kul vidhayakon ke aadhe se bhi adhik he
 Vishwas said that he will be the chief of AAP in place of Kejriwal
 dilli ke 48 varshiya mukhyamantri ab is baat se avgat the ki party main chal rahi halchal visheshkar dilli me emsidi chunaavon main mili haar ke baad kii sthiti kaa kumaar vishwaas dwaara phayda uthaane kii jo afvaahen thim wo niraadhaar nahin thim
 According to information received from AAP sources, neither the Chief Minister nor his office has denied the fact that such a thing happened
 sutron ke anusaar party jaldi hi is vishay main ek bayaan jari kar sakati he
 Kejriwal removed Kapil Mishra from the post of minister seven days after the incident
 lekin unhone kumaar vishwaas ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii kyonki kaha jaataa he ki donon ke bich kaaphi puraane paariwarik rishte hai or vah ek prasiddh netaa ko barkhaast karne vaale ke rup main nahin dikhnaa chaahate the
 The incident of the removal of the founding party members Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav from the party in 2015 is still a bitter memory for the party
 isliye party ke kai pramukh netaaon dwaara kumaar vishwaas ko hataae jane par jor dene ke baavjood mukhyamantri ne ek samjhaute par baatcheet kii jisamen kumaar vishwaas ko party kii rajasthan ikai kaa pramukh banaaya janaa bhi shaamil tha
 The comments kapil mishra ke karyaalay ke ek varisht adhikari ne is baat kii pushti kii ki kumaar vishwaas ke saath milakar unhone un vidhayakon ke saath ek baithak kii thi jo party main takhtapalat kii yojana ke samarthan main the
 But when Kejriwal took strategic steps to suppress the rebellion, they soon corrected their stand
 party ke sutron ne kaha ki unhen puraa yakeen tha ki vishwaas ko kejariwal ke khilaaf kadam uthaane ke liye bijepi protsaahit kar rahi thi
 Significantly, only last month, BJP had won a landslide victory in MCD elections and which is constantly entangled with Chief Minister Kejriwal
 kumaar vishwaas kai maukon par bijepi se kisi bhi tarah kaa sambandh hone se inkaar kar chuke hai
 But just before the meeting scheduled to remove Kejriwal, AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan publicly alleged that Vishwas wanted to break up the party at the instigation of the BJP
 vishwaas ne ise apni chhavi kharaab karne kaa hatkandaa bataaya or amanatulla ke khilaaf dandatmak karrwai kii maang kii
 According to the agreement reached with Kejriwal, Amanatullah Khan was removed from various party posts, but was also included in several committees of the Delhi Legislative Assembly as a compensation for his loyalty to Kejriwal
 dilli ke 48 varshiya mukhyamantri ab is baat se avgat the ki party main chal rahi halchal visheshkar dilli me emsidi chunaavon main mili haar ke baad kii sthiti kaa kumaar vishwaas dwaara phayda uthaane kii jo afvaahen thim wo niraadhaar nahin thim

 According to the agreement reached with Kejriwal, Amanatullah Khan was removed from various party posts, but was also included in several committees of the Delhi Legislative Assembly as a compensation for his loyalty to Kejriwal
 kejariwal ne kapil mishra ko is ghatana ke saat din baad mantri pad se hataa diya
 But he did not take any action against Kumar Vishwas as he is said to have a very old family relationship and did not want to be seen as a sacking of a famous leader
 saal 2015 main party ke sansthaapak sadasyon prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ke party se nikaale jane kii ghatana aaj bhi party ke liye kadavi yaadon kii tarah he
 So despite several party leaders insisting on the removal of Kumar Vishwas, the Chief Minister negotiated an agreement that included making Kumar Vishwas the head of the Rajasthan unit of the party
 tippaniyan a senior official of Kapil Mishra's office confirmed that he had held a meeting with mlas who were in support of the coup plan in the party, along with Kumar Vishwas
 lekin jab kejariwal ne vidroh ko dabaane ke liye ranneetik rup se kadam badaye to jald hi un logon ne apana rukh thik kar liya
 Sources in the party said that they were confident that the BJP was encouraging Vishwas to take steps against Kejriwal
 gauratlab he ki pichley maheene hi bijepi ne emsidi chunaavon main baari jeet hasil kii thi or jo lagaataar mukhyamantri kejariwal se ulajhati rahati he
 Kumar Vishwas has on several occasions denied any connection with the BJP
 lekin kejariwal ko hataane ke liye tay kii gai baithak se thik pehle aap ke vidhayak amanatulla khan ne saarvajanik rup se aropal laga diya ki vishwaas bijepi kii shah par party ko todna chaahate hai

 In 1983, Kapil Dev won the World Cup for India for the first time

 During this time there will be a lot of heat, which will bring conditions to England

 After Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, public opinion has been reported in these three states in the PSE survey, in which Congress President Ahulagandhi is seen giving a fierce competition to Prime Minister narendramodi in terms of popularity
 yahaan tak ki andhra pradesh main unhone piem modi ko lokapriyata ke maamle main pachhad diya he
 According to the Political Stock Exchange Survey, 38 percent of the people of Andhra Pradesh have accepted Narendra Modi as the PM post
 jabaki rahul gandhi ne yahaan unhen pachhad diya he or unhen rajya kii 44 fisadi janata ne piem pad ke liye pasand kiya he
 At the same time, if we talk about Telangana, 44 percent of the people here have accepted Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate
 jabaki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke paksh main 39 fisadi logon ne apni sahmati jataai he, yani telugana kii janata ke liye piem pad kii pasand main narendra modi or rahul gandhi ke bich mahaj 5 fisadi kaa fark rah gaya he
 Earlier, if we look at the survey data done in three states, Rahul Gandhi's popularity has increased significantly
 is saal ke aakhir main madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh jaise teen ahm rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 In these three states, India Today and Axis My India conducted the survey under the Political Stock Exchange

 Whereas in Rajasthan, Narendra Modi was 22 percent ahead of Rahul Gandhi in terms of choice of PM post
 chhattigarh main ye antar or bhi zyada rahaa
 PM Modi was preferred by 59 per cent and Rahul Gandhi by 34 per cent for the post of PM
 yani piem modi rahul gandhi se 25 fisadi aage rahe
 After these states of Central India, when the number came from South India, Rahul Gandhi left behind PM Modi in Andhra Pradesh and he became quite in the race of Telangana

 Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly says that master blaster Sachin Tendulkar has made the right decision to retire after the 200th Test match of his career, but also said, "if i was Sachin Tendulkar, retire one year earlier Would have paid 
 
 " During a chat show with NDTV, Sourav Ganguly said that Sachin Tendulkar is fortunate to have been in the Indian team despite a poor run for a long time
 unhone kaha, "pichley do-teen saal sachin tendulkar ke khel ke lihaaz se achche nahin rahe hai
 
 
 And he managed to retain his place in the Test team just because he is Sachin Tendulkar
 
 
 duniya bhar main yaa hindustan main kisi bhi cricketer ko itnaa lanbaa samay nahin diya gaya
 
 
 " ullekhneey he ki 40-varshiya sachin tendulkar ne pichley hafte apane kariyar ke 199wein test match main west indies ke khilaaf kul 10 ran banaae the
 Even before that, Sachin Tendulkar scored his last Test century in January 2011, and during this period he also scored half-century in his 20 innings only (76 runs against England in December 2012 in Kolkata, and Chennai in February 2013
 Has scored 81 against Australia)
 sachin tendulkar ke behad prabhaavshaalee aankadon (53
 This round has been very poor in terms of Test runs and 51 centuries) at an average of 71
 saurav ganguli ke mutabik, sachin tendulkar ne apane sanyas kii ghoshnaa bilkul sahi samay par kii he
 He said, "you have to accept that at some point you have to leave
 
 
 chah maheene or cricket khel lene se ab sachin tendulkar kaa koi bhala nahin hone vaala tha
 
 
 He (sachin Tendulkar) has made the right decision, and for me he has always been a champion, because i grew up watching him play since i was 14, and i watched him mature very closely
 
 
 vah apane kariyar ke oonche daur main ritair ho rahe hai, or vah ghar main khilne ja rahe hai
 
 
 Otherwise, if he (sachin Tendulkar) had played his last Test in South Africa, he would not have got half the love and respect as compared to Mumbai
 
 
 vah is pyaar or sammaan ke puri tarah hakdaar hai, or yah vidaai bilkul uchit he
 
 
 Had i been in his place, i would have gone a year ago, but Sachin Tendulkar is like that
 
 
 " It is worth mentioning that 40-year-old Sachin Tendulkar, who has been playing international cricket since the age of 16, is going to play his career in the 200th Test match against the visiting West Indies team from November 14 in the hometown Mumbai

 In the Parli Assembly, Pankaja got a cousin Dhananjay Munde, 121186 votes to Dhananjay Munde, Pankaja Munde got 90418 votes
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has emerged as the largest party in the Maharashtra Assembly elections
 vahiin rajya main bijepi ke kai diggajon ko haar bhi mili he
 Pankaja Munde, a minister in the government, has lost the election from her stronghold Parli

 Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Dhananjay Munde defeated his sister by nearly 30,000 votes
 dhananjay munde ko 121186 vot mili to vahiin pankaja munde ko maatr 90418 vot hasil hue
 Let us know that during the election campaign, not only Home Minister and BJP President Amit Shah came to campaign in support of Pankaja Munde, but bjp's firebrand leader and Prime Minister Narendra Modi also addressed the meeting in Parli
 chunaav prachaar main 370 se pakistan tak kii charchaapankaja munde ne gopinath munde kii viraasat ke saath-saath is ilaake main artical 370, teen talaak or pakistan ko bhi bada mudda banane kii koshish kii thi
 Pankaja Munde said during the election campaign that Maharashtra is no different from national issues and nation
 aise main rashtriya muddon par chunaav kyon naa ho
 But perhaps the people of Parli Assembly were more serious about local issues
 kya kehete hai sthaneey log?sthaneey str par pankaja munde ke khilaaf naaraazgi bahut zyada thi
 Guru Prasad, a resident of Parli, says that Gopinath Munde twice gave Pankaja Munde a chance in the election but he did not consider the area as his own
 pankaja munde ke paitruk gaanv kii sadak dekhakar yakeen nahin hota ki yah ek mantri kaa paitruk gaanv he
 The entire country is aware of the water shortage in Marathwada, but no concrete steps were taken by Pankaja Munde to overcome it

 Raju, who lives in Parli, says that in the election, if you want to discuss the issues, our local leader will come
 maharashtra kii chunavi bisaat par bijepi ke rashtravaadi mohare utane kaamyaab nahin ho paae jitani bijepi ne sambhaavna jataai thi
 Local pieces stamped out national issues
 yahi vajah he ki chunaav main do baar kii vidhayak kaa rasookh, rajya sarkaar main ek mantri kaa dabadabaa or soobe ke ek kaddavar netaa kii viraasat kaa sahaara bhi pankaja munde ko nahin bachaa paaya

 purve ne press conference main mahagathbandhan kii siton kaa elaan karte hue kaha ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main argedy 20, congress 9 or ralospa 5 siton par chunaav ladenge
 Also, Ramchandra Purve told that 3-3 seats have been given to Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awami Morcha (hum) Party and Mukesh Sahni's Vikas Insan Party (VIP)
 saath hi vidhansabha kii navada seat par hone vaale upachunaav kaa tikat bhi ham party ko mila he
 Apart from this, it has been announced to give the Congress one seat of Rajya Sabha
 yahi nahin, maale ko rajd cote se ek seat di gai he
 However, the names of the candidates who are contesting the Lok Sabha elections from the remaining seats have not been announced yet
 haalanki, is press conference ko lekar subah tak yah jaankaree thi ki mahagathbandhan main shaamil sabhi partiyon ke bade netaa press conference main shaamil honge
 Despite this, no major face of any party involved in the grand alliance was seen
 ajtak ko shuukravaar kii subah bhi yah jaankaree mili thi ki tejasvi yadav press conference main maujuud rahenge or siton ke bantwaaron kaa elaan karenge
 But they also remain absent
 argedy netaa tejasvi ke press conference main shaamil nahin hone ke sawaal par press conference main maujuud rajyasabha saansad manoj jha sawaal kaa sidhe-sidhe jawaab dene ne bachate dikhe
 Taking recourse to the BJP, he said that BJP had announced seat sharing on Thursday and JP Nadda was also present in his press conference but no big leaders attended
 lekin kisi ne bhi yah sawaal bijepi se nahin poocha
 According to Purve, Vibha Devi of RJD will contest from Nawada Lok Sabha seat
 vahiin, ham party ke pramukh jithan ram maanjhi gaya se loksabhaa chunaav main taal thokenge
 RLSP candidate Bhudev Chaudhary will contest from Jamui
 iske alaava sharad yadav argedy ke chunaav chinh par chunaav ladenge
 According to the announcement of seats by the grand alliance, Upendra Prasad from the party will contest from Aurangabad
 jaankaree ke mutabik is press conference se pehle 10 circular road sthit tejasvi ke ghar par ek baithak hui, jisamen sabhi bade netaa shaamil hue
 RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha, we party chief Upendra Kushwaha, Sharad Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav and other big leaders of Congress were also involved
 lekin mahagathbandhan kii press conference main kisi bhi bade netaa ke shaamil nahin hone ke kaaran kai prakaar ke sawaal uthne lage hai
 Questions are arising because the number of seats demanded by all the parties of the Grand Alliance has not come in their quota
 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress ne mahagathabandhan kii 11 siten maangi thim, lekin congress ko mahaj 9 siten di gai hai
 Also, it has been said to give one seat of Rajya Sabha
 argedy netaa manoj jha se ajtak dwaara yah puche jane par ki bade netaa kyon press conference main shaamil nahin hue, to jawaab main unhone kaha ki aaj sirf pehle charan kii ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa honi thi, jisamen kisi bade netaa ko nahin aana tha
 The day the complete list will be made, these big leaders will be in front of the public
 kisi bhi dal ko formet main tabadili kaa puraa adhikaar he or us adhikaar par sawaal nahin hona chahie

 Shweta Singh conducted this session
 shweta ne manoj sinha se rail bajet ko aam bajet main shaamil kiye jane ke baad aam aadmi kii ummid par sawaal kiya
 Manoj Sinha indicated that the Railway Safety Fund could be announced in the forthcoming budget
 is fund ke jariye koshish kii jaaegi ki bhartiya rail ko jiro accident rail banane kii kavayad kii jaaegi
 According to Sinha, this step was also taken during the previous NDA government, but after that the issue of safety fund in Manmohan government remained in cold storage

 jahaan aazaadee ke baad rail yatri main 20 guna or rail maal dhulaai main 9 guna ijapha darj hua he vahiin in 70 saal ke dauraan rail network main mahaj 1
 Increased 5-fold
 yahi bhartiya rail kii sabase badi samasya he
 While earlier governments used to spend up to Rs 40-50 thousand crore to strengthen the railway network, the Modi government had made a provision of Rs 1 lakh crore railway budget last year
 aagaamee bajet main bhi ummid he ki kendra sarkaar ek lakh karod rupee se zyada rakam railway ko majboot karne ke liye praavdhaan karegi
 To strengthen the railways in the upcoming budget, the government will try to run the goods trains on the time table on the lines of passenger trains in the country
 vahiin railway root ke kanjeshan par bolte hue simha ne kaha ki desh main jis root par 100 gaadiyaan chalani chahie usapar maujuuda samay main 150-160 gaadiyaan chalaai ja rahi he
 To deal with this situation, the Railways are rapidly constructing dedicated freight corridors
 simha ne bataaya ki 2019 tak is kaam ko puraa kar liya jayega jiske baad desh main rail kii raftaar ko badhaane or root se kanjeshan ko kam karne main madad milegi
 Sinha said that in the upcoming budget, an important announcement could be made on decentralizing the functioning of the Railway Board for the smooth running of the railway along with the double-decker train
 manoj sinha ne bataaya ki beete dinon main dekhne ko mila he ki railway aatankwaadiyon ke liye soft torget rahaa he
 For this, the central government has taken several steps to strengthen the Nerleway Protection Force
 sinha ke mutabik bina suraksha ke railway kii raftaar badhaane kaa kaam nahin kiya ja saktaa

 27 Iranian soldiers died in this attack
 jabaki 13 ghayal hai
 It is being told that Iranian soldiers were returning after patrolling the border when the attack took place
 iran main yah aatmghaatee hamalaa khash-jaahedaan road par hua
 This happened precisely on the pattern of attack on the army in Pulwama
 reports ke mutabik, jab revolutionari guard corps karmi seemaa par gashti ke baad laut rahe the tab khash-jaahedaan road par bas ke saath ek car chalane lagi
 Which was loaded with explosives
 tabhi bas main car aa ghusi or joardaar dhamaakaa hua
 The attack killed 27 soldiers and injured 13
 reports ke mutabik, is hamale kii jimmedaari iran ke khatarnaak tebrist group 'jaish-al-adl' ne lee he
 This terrorist organization has been blacklisted in Iran
 america se mulaaqaat ke pehle hua hamalaa
 
 
 Significantly, a conference was held by the US in Poland to discuss Kimidil East and Iran
 is sammelan main 60 deshon ne bhaag liya tha
 Terrorist organizations were opposing this conference
 bharat main bhi isi pattern par hua hamalaa
 
 
 Significantly, 37 soldiers were killed in the biggest suicide attack on soldiers in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday afternoon
 2500 javaanon kaa kafila pulavama jile main srinagar-jammu rajmarg se guzar rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, a bus filled with explosives-laden car jawans entered the bus and exploded fast
 is hamale main 37 jawan shahid ho gaye hai, jabaki kai jawan abhi bhi ghayal hai
 The government is also in action after this attack
 aaj pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aguwai main suraksha maamalon kii cabinet cameti kii baithak honi he

 hadappa sabhyataa ke sabase bade gyaat shahar ‘rakhigadhi' se praapt namoonon par hue ek haalia shodh ne ‘aaryon ke bahari hone' ke siddhant par prashnchihn laga diya he
 This research was published in the prestigious research paper 'cell' this month titled 'absent the DNA of Eastern Europe (stepi) or Iranian farmers in an ancient genus of Harappa'
 iske mukhya shodhakarta evam pune sthit deccan college ke purv kulapati professor vasant scindia ke is daawey ke baad sabase bada sawaal uthaa he ki arya kya baahar se nahin aae the
 Professor Shinde has answered many such questions in detail
 jawaab : hamaara shodh prakashit hone ke baad zyaadaatar charchaa vaigyanik (diene) saakshyon ko lekar hui
 Scientific evidence as well as archaeological evidence in our research clearly shows that nothing like Aryan attack or mass exodus happened in history
 logon kaa vyapaar aadi ke silsile main sampark tha, iske kaaran kuch mishrit diene milte hai
 Aryans were outsiders, this theory is unscientific and baseless
 yah sirf anumaanon par aadhaarit he
 i would like to say that 'from Afghanistan to Bengal and Kashmir to Andaman and Nicobar, the whole of South Asia' is a race, the ancestors of all are one
 arya-anarya kii baaten galat siddhant ke kaaran baad main hone lageen
 Answer: Scientific evidence explains the 'change in environment' as the main reason for the decline of the Harappan civilization
 2,000 isa-purv ke aas-paas paryaavaran shushk hone laga tha
 This led to the simultaneous collapse of not only Harappan but also the civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia
 hadappa sabhyataa kii mukhya basaawatein saraswati nadi ke aas-paas raheen
 When Saraswati started drying up, people started moving to other places
 isi kaaran vahaan kii basaavaton kaa patan hua
 Answer: We should understand the difference between language and script
 sanskrit sabhi bhashaaon kii janani he, iskaa vikaas 2000 yaa 1500 isa purv main hua
 However no scientific evidence of linguistic issue is found
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki sabhi indo-european bhashaaon kaa udgam sanskrit he
 Our research shows that people here first went out, then outsiders came
 isse sabit hota he ki sanskrit kaa asar vahaan kii bhashaaon par padaa
 Now speaking of the script
 hadappa sabhyataa kii lipi ko abhi tak padhaa nahin ja sakaa he
 It can be said on this basis that the people of Harappa were also Sanskrit speakers, their script was different
 abhi dakshin bharat ko dekhen to sanskrit sabase adhik vahiin jivit he
 The languages of South India are very similar to Sanskrit
 jawaab : hadappa sabhyataa main sirf paanch bade shahar milte hai
 Apart from this, eight-ten small cities have been found
 abhi tak hadappa sabhyataa kii 2,000 se adhik basaawatein mil chuki hai
 Most of the settlements are rural
 vaidic sahitya main bhi shaharon kaa zikr he
 The Harappan and Vedic civilization prove to be the same based on known archaeological evidence
 rakhigadhi kii khudaai main vibhinn jyamitiya agnikund mili hai
 These Agnikundas are also mentioned in Vedic literature
 hadappa sabhyataa ke log agni poojak the, yah spasht he
 The Harappans were the Vedic people, what can be more proof of this? Answer: This research began in 2006
 khudaai shuru hui or ham sakshya jutate rahe
 We emphasized scientific-archaeological evidence, not speculations
 pratishthit vaishvik sansthaanon main namoonon kii jaanch kii gayi
 Our research was published in SAIL due to scientific-archaeological evidence
 ab saare parinaam 2019 main aa paae to ham kya kar sakate hai? yah pehle ho jaataa tab bhi log kuch na kuch kehete
 Actually, those who are governed by politics, they see politics in everything

 bihar police apane karnaamon ke liye hameshaa surkhiyon main rahati he
 This time also the police made such a joke that the Chief Minister of the state Nitish Kumar had to feel ashamed
 purv mukhyamantri dow
 During the funeral of Jagannath Mishra, not a single shot was fired from one of the 22 rifles fired for the salute
 dow
 Jagannath Mishra was cremated on Wednesday in his native village, Balua Supaul, which was also attended by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
 mishra kaa somvaar ko nai dilli main dil kaa daura padane se nidhan ho gaya tha
 After this, the state government announced a 3-day state mourning and his last rites were being performed with state honors
 rajkeey sammaan ke dauraan police kii 22 rifles aasmaan kii taraf uthin jarur, lekin usamen se goli nahin nikali
 That is, 22 rifles of 22 did not fire
 mukhyamantri ke saamne police kii sthiti kii pole khulte hi aalaa adhikari agal-bagal jhaankne lage
 The Chief Minister pointed to the IG and asked what was happening and the SP of the district shrugged off the matter by saying that it was a high-level matter, so only the DGP would be able to tell anything on it

 com / vbnse7ontt— ANI (@ANI) August 22, 2019 Let us know that the Chief of the state Nitish Kumar has always said that whatever resources are needed, they are ready to give to the police and give them but they want the results
 lekin aisa rigelt hoga yah kisi ne nahin sochaa tha
 Bihar Police has always been ridiculed for one reason or the other
 kabhi pulicekarmiyon kii gatividhi kii vajah se to kabhi sansadhano ke abhaav main
 But this incident is really shocking and it should be investigated at a high level
 aakhir kaise police aisi goliyon kii badaulat aparaadhiyon kaa muqabla karegi, jo maukey par nikal hi nahin paati
 RJD MLA Yaduvanshi Yadav, who arrived to attend the funeral, has demanded a probe, alleging serious scam in the police
 "20 biswa kaa ek bigha hota he
 40 Biswa means two bighas
 itani zamin he mere paas
 The attack of the cows increased so much that the fields had to be built in boundary
 ek bighas ke liye 20 se 25 trali pathar ke tukade lagate hai
 a trolley comes from 900 to 1200 rupees
 agar tractor apane ghar kaa he to 700-800 prati trali ke kharche main ho jaataa he lekin aam taur par 1000 se 1200 rupee prati trollies lag hi jaataa he
 The pieces of stone match the trolley
 chandpur kii pahari se ye pathar cat rahe hai
 Have you heard illegal mining? vahiin se laa rahe hai
 It takes 35 to 40 thousand to make a bigha boundary
 mere to 60-70 hazaar lag gaye
 " yah hisaab kamai kaa nahin he balki us laagat kaa he jo gaayon ke kaaran kisaanon ke bahikhaate main haal philhal se judane laga he
 In the old cantonment village of Dholpur, Rajasthan, four fields were seen in many fields
 chaar se paanch foot kii charadivari banane se bhi kaam nahin hota he
 To make it even higher and stronger, thorn bushes have to be cut and erect along the walls so that the cows do not enter the fields by trapping them
 iskaa bhi alag se 10-15 hazaar karch aa jaataa he
 Cows have changed villages
 gaanvon main gaayon ke naam badal gaye hai
 Some call them stray cows, some associate terror with cows
 noujvaan gaayon ko dekh kar modi ji, yogi ji or vasundhara ji bhi kehane lage hai
 Look, Modi ji is going Yogi ji
 gaay kii raajnneeti mata kehane se shuru hui thi, aawaara kehane par aa gai he
 There was so much politics in Rajasthan about cows
 kade niyam bane iske kaaran aap haive par sand or gaayon ko ghoomte dekhenge
 On the highway going to Gwalior, a bullock was killed by a carman
 use tadapata dekh man machal gaya
 Cows, bulls, calves and bulls will be found wandering from place to place
 ab inhen koi nahin bechata he
 Nobody buys
 gaushalaayein nahin hai
 The group of cows are wandering the court in search of fodder
 jab koi khilaaegaa nahin to duusare ke kheton main dhaava to bolenge hi
 Pramod Paliwal said that even building a five-foot wall does not work
 uske baad bhi raat ko kheton main janaa padataa he ki kahin gaayon ne hamalaa to nahin kar diya
 The farmer is now also guarding
 pichley saal bajra or chanaa kii fasalon ko kaaphi nuksaan hua tha
 a fair was held in Dhaulpur in the month of November
 lekin gau hatya kii raajnneeti ke kaaran us saal pashuon kii bikri hi nahin hui
 If there was no buyer, he left the bull and the calf there
 is kaaran bhi yahaan inaki sankhya bad gai he
 If you have to spend 40-50 thousand to surround the fields with the wall, then you guess what will happen to us
 is kahani ke saath maine jo tasviren lagaai hai, unhen apni ankhon se dekhnaa ek aise badsoorat manzar ko dekhnaa tha, jisaki keemat kisaan hi nahin pahaad bhi chukaa rahe hai
 Who would have benefited from the business of these stones to build a wall in the fields in the name of cows
 zarur go hatya kii raajnneeti kaa laabh ek tabake ko mila hoga jo avaidh khanan ke zarie laal pathar ke chattaanon ko kaat kar supplai karne main laga hoga
 The comments rajasthan ke gaanvon main jaaen to kheton ko dekhie
 If walls are found there, imagine how politics affects the land
 tivi ke saamne gaay ko lekar bhadakaane vaale bayaan dekar us madhyam varg ke bich apni raajnneeti to chamakaa gaye lekin uski keemat kisaan kis tarah se chukaa rahe hai, yah kisi ko nazar nahin aayaa
 If there were gaushalas, there would have been arrangements, then no one would ask cow mother to sing
 gaayon se khauf khaakar deevaaren nahin khadi karata
 The construction of these walls in open fields has changed the way of the village
 ek khet se duusare ke khet main jane ke raste badal gaye hai
 The path is long gone
 ghumaavdaar ho gaya he
 You will not see this issue, but the walls will be seen in the fields, the farmers also worry behind those walls that if 50 thousand are planted due to cows then what is left
 is raajnneeti main badlaav nahin aayaa to jaldi hi rajasthan main yaa to khet khaali chhod die jaaenge yaa phir har khet main chaaron taraf diwaar ban jaaegi jahaan fasalein nahin uga karengi, deevaaren bana karengi

 If you go to the villages of Rajasthan, look at the fields
 agar vahaan deevaaren milen to sochie ki raajnneeti kis tarah zamin par asar paidaa karti he
 By giving provocative statements about the cow in front of the TV, their politics was brightened by the middle class, but no one could see how farmers are paying its price
 agar gaushalaayein hotin, vahaan vyavasthaaen hoti to gaoo mata ko koi aawaara gaayen nahin kahata
 Do not fear the cows and build walls
 khule hue kheton main in deevaaron ke banane se gaanv ke raste badal gaye hai
 The ways of moving from one farm to another have changed
 rasta lanbaa ho gaya he
 Is curved
 yah mudda aapako nahin dikhegaa magar kheton main deevaaren dikhengi, un diwaron ke peeche kisaanon kii chintaa bhi ki gaayon ke kaaran 50 hazaar laga diya to bachaa kya
 If there is no change in this politics, soon either the fields in Rajasthan will be left vacant or there will be walls around every field where crops will not grow, they will build walls

 congress ne is baat ko khaarij kiya ki bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke rup main narendra modi aane vaale loksabhaa chunaav main samprag ke liye chunauti ho sakate hai
 Asked by reporters whether Narendra Modi was an obstacle in the upa's way of coming to power for the third time at the Center, party spokesperson Rashid Alvi said in a sarcastic tone, "same Narendra, who is the Chief Minister of Gujarat
" ’alvi ne modi ke gujarat main lagaataar teesri baar sarkaar banane ko koi khaas tavajjo na na dene kaa prayaas karte hue kaha, ‘gujarat desh ke 28 rajyon main se ek he
 Congress has also formed the government for the third time in a row in Delhi
 isamen kuch ajooba nahin he
 Asked if Modi will be a major issue in the discussion at the Congress' Chintan Camp to be held in Jaipur, the Congress spokesperson said that there is no question of discussing about any one person
 ham desh ke samaksh samasyaon par charchaa karenge
 We will discuss the problem of common man and poor
 jab unase yah poocha gaya ki kya agle loksabhaa chunaav main modi kaa muqabla karne ke liye congress kii ore se rahul gandhi ko utaara jaayegaa, alvi ne kaha ki rahul gandhi hamaare netaa hai
 He is the leader of the country

 ' haalia nikaay chunaavon main udasin si pratikriya milane ke baavjood gujarat sarkaar i-voting kii suvidha ko ab panchayat chunaavon tak vistaarit karne kii yojana bana rahi he
 Currently, the facility of e-voting is limited to the voters of all the eight municipal corporations of the state
 jila, taluka or gram panchayat ke matadaataaon ko abhi tak yah suvidha praapt nahin he
 Before taking the decision, the Panchayat Department of the state has started collecting information from all over India and other countries in terms of feasibility of the project

 'gabbar Is Back' is directed by Krish and starring Akshay Kumar, Shruti Haasan, Suman Talwar and Sunil Grover
 saath hi mehmaan bhoomika main nazar aaengi karina kapur
 Let me give a little hint to the story of the film, Aditya i
e
 Akshay Kumar is a professor in National College and a student's favorite here and neither the police nor the goons can enter this college, because i have no answer for this
 
 is college main eemaandaaree kii lahar bahati he or professor aditya hi gabbar hai, jo bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ladate hai baaki kahani to aap film dekhakar hi jaan sakate hai or janani bhi chahie
 Whether the film is bad or good, whatever the film is, it takes hard work and money
 ab baat yah ki mujhe film kisi lagi to pehle khaamiyon kii baat kar lete hai
 The first drawback is that there is nothing in the film story and the film, which you have never seen before, the same gripping theme, how many films have come, on the same story, except the other thing neither a scene nor a twist
 Climax that attracts you
 film ke dialogs ho yaa script kahin bhi aap uske saath jud nahin pate
 Akshay speaks dialogues, but you don't feel their impact
 aap film dekhte rahete hai or bina ise mahasoos kiye cinema haul se baahar nikal jate hai
 Gabbar's direction also found me weak
 khayr ye thi khamiyaan
 Now talk about the merits
 tippaniyan Let's talk about acting first in merits
 film main sunil grover kaa kirdaar bahut achche se ubhar kar aata he or unhone kaam bhi acha kiya he
 Shruti does not have much to do in the film, but wherever she is, she does not deviate from her character's voice
 akshay kii kad-lathi ke liye yah kirdaar bilkul thik he par vah kirdaar ko prabhaavshaalee nahin bana pate
 Yes, his action is good
 akshay ke phans shaayad film kaa majaa uthaa saken
 Suman Talwar, who is a villain in the film, also does not leave any mark
 gaanon kii baat karen to film kaa gaanaa teri meri kahani thik hai
 
 
 The rest of you watch the film, perhaps you can see some more qualities in the film, then the rest of the decision is two stars in my hand from 'gabbar is Back'
 film kii kahani kaa thodaa-sa hint de detaa hum, aditya yani akshay kumaar neshnal college main professor hai or yahaan ke students ke fevorett hai or is college main na to police ghus sakati he na hi gunde, kyonki iskaa koi jawaab mere paas nahin he
 There is a wave of honesty in this college and it is Prof
 Aditya Gabbar, who fights against corruption, the rest of the story can be learned only by watching the film
 film chaahe kharaab ho yaa acchhee kyonki kisi bhi film ho usamen mehnat to lagati hi he or paisa bhi
 Now the thing is, how did i like the film, first let's talk about the flaws
 sabase pehali khami ye ki film kahani or film main aisa kuch nahin, jo aapane pehle kabhi na dekha ho, vahi ghisapita vishay, kitni hi filmein aa chuki hai, aisi hi kahani par, duusari cheez na to koi seen or na hi koi mode sivaay clymex ke jo aapako aakarshith karata he
 There are dialogues or scripts of the film where you cannot connect with it anywhere
 akshay dialogs bolte hai, par unka asar aap mahasoos nahin karte
 You keep watching the movie and walk out of the cinema hall without realizing it
 gabbar kaa nirdesan bhi mujhe kamjor laga
 Well there were flaws
 ab baat khoobiyon kin
 The comments khoobiyon main pehle abhinay kii baat kar lete hai
 Sunil Grover's character in the film emerges very well and he has also done a good job
 shruti ke paas karne ko film main zyaada kuch nahin he par vah jahaan bhi hai, apane kirdaar ke sur se nahin bhataktin
 This character is perfect for Akshay's height, but he is not able to make the character effective
 haa, unka ection acha he
 Akshay's fans may enjoy the film
 suman talwaar jo ki film main villen hai, vah bhi koi chhap nahin chhod pate
 Talking of songs, the song of the film is Teri Meri Kahani
 
 
 baaki aap film dekhie shaayad film main aapako kuch or khubiyaan dikh jaaen, to baaki faisalaa aapke haath main meri or se 'gabbar ij back' ko do stars

 piem modi agle hafte saudi arab ke riyaad jaaengeriyaad main 29 se 31 oktober tak nivesh kaa bada kaarykram hepradhanmantri narendra modi agle hafte saudi arab jaaenge
 He will join the third Future Investment Initiative (FII) to be held in the Saudi Arabian city of Riyadh from 29 to 31 October
 is salanaa nivesh kaarykram kaa is baar kaa theme he-'whot ij next for global bijness' yani vaishvik kaarobaar main aage kya hoga
 Organized by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, the event is a high-level platform that provides an opportunity to meet Saudi Arabian policymakers and global business representatives
 ek tir se saadhenge do nishaanegauratlab he ki piem modi aise mahatvapurn maukey par saudi arab ja rahe hai, jab kashmir ke masale par bharat duniya ko yah sandesh dene kii koshish main laga hua he ki vahaan sab kuch thik he
 This will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi's second visit to Saudi Arabia
 PM modi kii yatra is myne main ahm he ki vah kashmir par sandesh dene ke saath hi nivesh or aarthik vikaas ko gati dene kii sambhaavnaaon ko bhi talaashenge
 National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval went to Riyadh this month to prepare for PM Modi's visit
 donon desh arthvyavastha, raksha, urja or aatankwaad ke masale par gaharaa sahyog kaayam karne kii koshish main lage hai
 Prior to this, PM Modi visited Riyadh in 2016, when he was given the highest civilian honor of Saudi Arabia
 turki nahin jaaenge piemgauratlab he ki piem modi ko saudi kii is yatra ke baad turki bhi janaa tha, lekin turki ke raashtrapati recep taiyap erdogaan ke jariye sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main kashmir mudda uthaane or financial ection task force (efeetief) baithak main khulkar pakistan kaa saath dene ke baad,bharat ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii prastaavit turki yatra ko radd karadia he
 Why the trip to Turkey was canceled? India is believed to have taken this step in view of Turkey's attitude towards Pakistan

 DDCA ko lekar chal rahe vivaad ke bich jang ne ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye ek sadasyeey gopal subramanyam jaanch ayog par sawaal uthaae hai
 According to LG, the formation of the Commission of Inquiry is illegal because the consent of the Lieutenant Governor and the Center was not taken for this

 CNG fitness scam kii jaanch hui thi khaarijuparajyapal ke mutabik dilli centre shasit pradesh he or use puri tarah rajya kaa darja nahin mila he
 Apart from this, any commission can be set up only after obtaining the consent of the Governor through the Governor
 isi tark ke aadhaar par sienji fitness kit scam kii jaanch ke liye kejariwal sarkaar kii ore se gathit ayog ko bhi uparajyapal ne khaarij kar diya tha
 The provisions of the Inquiry Act are not being followed that the central government may consider the recommendation of Najib Jung to cancel the commission on Friday
 centre sarkaar is guuruuvaar ko hi vichaar kar sakati thi, lekin milad-ul-nabi ke chalate aadhikarik avkaash kii vajah se faisla nahin liya ja sakaa
 Central government sources have also claimed that the manner in which the Kejriwal government has constituted the Gopal Subramanian Commission is completely unclear
 kejariwal ne iske liye inquairi act ke praavdhaanon kaa paalan nahin kiya he
 According to the Rajasthan Case Act in 2011, any commission can be set up to investigate 'important and definite matters for the public interest'

 He says that the Prime Minister is sensitive about health

 He is committed to his old notifications in the case of warning on cigarette boxes
 haalanki ab tak is maamle main lagaataar yah vivaad bana hua he ki sarkaar ne apane notification par roak kyon laga di
 It started with the statements of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health Affairs and BJP MP Dilip Gandhi
 unhone tambaakoo se cancer hone kii koi aadhikarik shodh nahin hone kii baat kahi thi
 After this, another member of the same committee and another BJP MP, Shyamcharan Gupta, also increased the controversy by adding the voice of Dilip Gandhi

 According to the old notification, 85 percent picture warning was to be mandatory on the products of tobacco product from 1 April
 lekin baad main bengalooru se yah khabaren ai ki modi ne ise 60 fisadi karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 But in a special conversation with India Today, Health Minister Nadane said on this question, our government believes in parliamentary traditions and the committee asked for some time when the ministry made its stand in the standing committee
 aise main abhi yah sansadeey cameti kii sampatti he or ab ham uski report kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 We will issue a notification as soon as the parliamentary committee gives its report

 jab tak galati kaa pataa chalata tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi or titanic himkhand se ja takaraayaa
 This book even states that even after the collision, the crew and the passengers on board could have been saved from sinking if the ship had not been parked in the reverse direction after the collision

 Swami Chakrapani said in his statement, 'BJP and Sangh have cheated Hindus

 Recently, some shocking decrees for party workers have come out on behalf of Mamta Banerjee
 mamata banerjee ne hidaayat di he ki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan mahilaayein lipstick na lagaaein
 While other parties are calling it an electoral stunt, TMC also has different opinions about it
 vaise dilli main party ke star ummidavaar vishwajit mamata kii 'haa main haa' milaate najar aa rahe hai
 What can the discipline have to do with the lipstick and sari's matching dot? You too must have wondered what this question is
 lekin haal hi main mamata didi ne apane workars ko aagaah kiya he ki chunaav tak ve fishan se dur rahen, lipstick na lagaaein, sari se match karti bindi bhi na lagaaein
 At the same time, men have also been told to abstain from alcohol
 party kaa kahana he ki chunaav ke dauraan anushaasan baratna jaruri he, khaskar aise samay main, jab mamata banerjee kii nazren dilli kii siyasat par jami hui he
 Though this decree may or may not have an impact in Bengal, tmc's star candidate in Delhi, Vishwajit, seems completely in agreement with it
 vishwajit kehete hai ki fishan kar prachaar ke liye nikalne kii kya jarurat he? ve mamata didi kii baat se sahamat hai
 Other parties are only describing it as an election stunt
 netaaon kaa to yahaan tak kahana he ki mamata ke is bayaan par karrwai kyon nahin ho rahi he, ye to fatwa he
 BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, 'mamta ji feels that she is above everything

 kuch kaa kahana he ki sharaab kii baat to samaj main aati he, lekin mahilaon ke liye jo kaha gaya, vah thik nahin he
 However, it is laughable to come across such things during elections, and this decree is hurting many women as well

 Despite the bill being pending in Parliament, the cabinet passed the ordinance and sent it to the President for approval

 Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj appealed to the President not to sign the ordinance and on 26 September submitted a memorandum to President Pranab Mukherjee along with BJP Parliamentary Party President LK Advani, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley
 aam aadmi party ne bhi morcha khol diya
 After this, protests also started coming from within the Congress, after which the President summoned three senior ministers of the government, Kapil Sibal, Sushil Kumar Shinde and Kamal Nath and asked for clarification
 lekin sutron ke mutabik, raashtrapati ne vivaad ko dekhte hue pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke videsh daure se lautne ke baad hi adhyadesh par antim faisla lene or tab tak kanoonee salaah mashvira karne kaa sanket diya
 The Congress had started to fear that if Mukherjee also walked the path of former President APJ Abdul Kalam, the Congress-led government on the track of corruption would find it difficult in the assembly elections of five states
 kalam ne laabh ke pad ke maamle main sansad se paarit kanoon ko naamanzoor kar punarvichaar ke liye lautaa diya tha

 The Supreme Court, in its judgment on July 10, said that if a MP or MLA is sentenced to two years or more, he will be disqualified
 lekin adhyadesh main sarkaar ne yah vyavastha kii thi ki sajaa ke 90 din main upree adaalat main chunauti dene par ayogy ghoshit nahin hoga
 After conviction in the trial court, salary allowances will not be received until the upper court acquits them

 Uddhav has also regretted getting other parties more important than Shiv Sena

 The comments uddhav ko poocha gaya ki chunakar aae saansadon ke mukaable jo ehmiyat shivasena kii rashtriya raajnneeti main honi chahie yah nahin dikhti

 By the way, this dealer of death is crying in captivity and crying he wants to write a letter to his mother but the police suspect that this may be one of his tricks
 ye khat uski maa ke bajaay uske aantki aakaao ke liye bhi ho saktaa he
 The letter goes something like this: 'dear Ammi, i regret that i did not listen to my elders and i got caught in the wrong people, which resulted in the death of all innocent people
 maine jo gunaah kiya he uski sajaa to mujhe khuda degaa hi lekin main aap logo ko ek baat jarur bataanaa chahta hum
 Ammi, my letter will definitely listen to the youth of the village

 'ye chitthee us dil ke ehsaas bayaan kar rahi he jisane maasoom begunaah logon par tabad tod goliyaan barasaai or puure shahar ko aatank ke kaale siyaah andhere main dhakel diya
 It seems from each letter written in this letter that the terrorist Kasab regrets his actions, but what can be so soft that the heart does not shiver in death
 or yahi shaq police ko bhi he use lag rahaa he ki kahi ye khat kasaab kii ammi se zyada uske aatanki aakaao ke liye naa ho
 Kasab has written the letter in Urdu and in many places in Urdu, Nukte Jero Jabar has a different meaning, so the police is getting this letter in Hindi from an Urdu translator and the Urdu translator is investigating the letter very closely
 wo har line har haruf kaa har sambhav matlab nikaal rahaa he taaki isamen kahi koi code koi sandesh chipa naa rah jaae
 In the training given to Kasab on terrorism, misleading security agencies under the guise of emotion is a big tactic
 philhal police is chitthee ko kasaab ke ghar nahi bhej rahi he

 ) a man shoots his own video on his mobile
 wo kahata he ki uskaa katl ho saktaa he
 Not only this, he also mentions the names of his murderers
 phir iske kuch din baad hi sachmuch use goliyon se shoot kar diya jaataa he
 Was this case easy for the police? When the police investigation starts after the murder, then the truth comes out, in which a sensational story of the shoot and then the shoot was hidden
 murder kaa yah cese bilkul open and shat cese tha kyonki marane vaala naa sirf apane katl kii baat balki katl kaa makasad or kaatilon ke naam tak bataa gaya tha
 There will hardly be an easy case for the police, but the story did not end here
 sharaab ke nashe main banaaya videokehte hai ki marataa hua insaan kabhi jhooth nahin bolta, magar is shaks ne jhooth bolaa
 It was a threat to his life, it is true, but who would kill him did not know it
 isiilie isane kaatilon ke naam galat le liye yani is video main isane aadha sach kaha or aadha jhooth
 At the time when he was recording the video, at the time he had drunk a lot of liquor or rather he was given a drink and then in the same drunk he called the names of his murderers
 teen logon ne milakar rachi katl kii sajishplanning jabardast thi
 Before the death, the testimony of his own murder was also given and the names of the murderers were also called
 shaq kii to koi gunjaaish nahin bachi thi, magar is video ke baahar kaa jab asli sach saamne aayaa, to khud makatool ke hi ghar main bhuuchaal aa gaya
 Maktool is Dheeraj Kipnipreeti, Dheeraj's maternal brother, Varun, and Jaideep, a former Delhi Police constable, had conspired for the murder
 yahi wo teen hai, jinhone pehle dhiraj se usee ke mobile par usee ke katl kii usee se video recording karai
 Called the murderer's name and then killed himself
 hatya kii sajeesh main shaamil shaks kii patnikatl kii is kahani kaa ek sira rishton se judata tha, to doosraa daulat se
 The wife was aware of her husband's every secret
 use apane pati ke dost or dushman sabaki jaankaree thi
 Just by adding this information, he created such a cycle of conspiracy that the husband could never get out of it again
 offis main kiya gaya dhiraj kaa katlshahar ke property dealer or finance kaa dhandha karne vaale dhiraj kii unheen ke offis main goli maar kar hatya kar di jaati he
 Two attackers, wearing helmets, enter the office and fire a total of five
 teen goli dhiraj ko lagati he, jabaki do dhiraj ke pita jagavir ko
 Even after consuming three bullets, Dheeraj stutters and tries to flee, but then falls and dies, while Dheeraj's father survives
 katl ke baad patni ne police ko diya mobileis sansanikhej vaardaat ke fouran baad dhiraj kii patni priti police ko ye bataati he ki paison ke len-dein ko lekar dhiraj kii kai logon se dushmani thi or wo use jaan se maarane kii dhamkee bhi de rahe the
 Preeti also gives Dheeraj's Vomobile to the police, in which Dheeraj told about his own murder and slayer
 pati ke mamere bhai se priti kaa sambandhshuruaati jaanch main hi police ko kuch aisi baaten pataa chalati hai, jisase use priti par shaq hota he
 In fact, during the investigation, police get information that Preity had an affair with Dheeraj's maternal brother Varun and this connection was made last year when Dheeraj remained in jail for eight months in connection with the murder attempt
 aakhirkaar police ke saamne kabuula sachisi ke baad police jab priti or varun se sakhti se poochtacha karti he, to donon tut jate hai or phir sari kahani bataa dete hai
 Actually, in addition to the business of business, Dheeraj also used to work in finance
 wo peeche teen percent par paise uthaa kar aage logon ko aath percent par udhaar diya karata tha
 Dheeraj had also given nearly 1
5 crore rupees to Delhi Police's former soldier Jaideep, who was also involved in the Delhi Police's former soldier, but Jaideep could not return the money on time
 isko lekar dhiraj or jayadeep main jhagada bhi hua
 Meanwhile, Jaideep also comes to know about Preity and Varun's relationship as Varun used to work with Dheeraj's cousin as well as his brother
 sipaahi ke kehane par priti ne dhiraj ko pilaai sharabisi ke baad jayadeep ne varun or priti ke saath ek samjhauta kiya
 He said that if the three together remove Dheeraj from the road, then both of them will get married and all three will divide his property in half
 jayadeep ke kehane par priti ne ek raat dhiraj ko sharaab pilaa kar usase mobile par uski video recording kara lee
 During the recording, those people who were called as slayer endlessly used to exchange money with patience
 purv sipaahi kii talash main he pulicephir 26 june ko priti ne hi phone kar varun or jayadeep ko offis bulawaaya
 After this, Varun and Monu shoot Dheeraj inside the office, while Jaideep himself stands outside
 police ne priti or varun ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Now the police are searching for the third mastermind of this conspiracy i

 The destruction of nature in Kedarnath caused havoc, while the Shivling, which was melting prematurely in the Amarnath Yatra, has become a cause of concern for the devotees
 or aise main kailash maansarovar kii yatra kaa sthagit hona shiv bhakton ko dukhi kar rahaa he
 Will the visit of Kailash Mansarovar be canceled? After the devastation in Devbhoomi Uttarakhand, now the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra is also under the cloud of crisis
 itibipi ne grih mantralay ko bheji apni report main is baat kaa khulaasa kiya he ki kailash yatra karnaa abhi surakshit nahin he
 Taking this report as the basis and looking at the devastation caused by heavy rains in Uttarakhand and heavy rains, the visit of Kailash Mansarovar has been postponed for the next one and a half months but if the weather continues to remain the same then the annual Kailash Mansarovar The trip can also be canceled altogether
 itibipi ke mutabik sobala ke neeche ke teen pul kanjyoti tawaghat or ailagaad bah gaye hai
 The condition of the bridge around Pithoragarh and Kali river is also bad, so continuing the journey will not be empty of danger
 is saal pavitra kailash par sthit bhagwaan shiv ke darshan karne or maansarovar ke pavitra jhil main snaan ke liye tirthayatriyon ke kul 18 jatthe vahaan jane vaale the, jisamen keval pehla jattha hi ravaanaa hua tha
 But due to bad weather, he also had to be stuck in the way of China for 2 days
 baaki duusare jatthe se lekar 10wein jatthe kii yatra dedh maheenon ke liye sthagit kar di gai he
 The entire responsibility of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra rests with the ITBP, the indo-tibetan Border Police, who take responsibility for the food and drink of the devotees right from the start of their journey till their arrival at Kailash
 lekin uttarakhand main hui tabaahi ke baad itibipi ne grih mantralay ko suzav bheje hai
 He has described the footpaths here as totally unsuitable for the movement of passengers
 pehle hi kedarnath main mausam ne koharaam machaa rakhaa he or amarnath main vakt se pehle shivlinga pigal rahaa he
 In such a situation, the news of postponement of Kailash Mansarovar Yatra has made the devotees sad
 kailash maansarovar kii yatra par keval bharat hi nahin balki anya deshon ke shraddhalu bhi jate hai
 And each batch takes 22 days to complete the journey

 If the three clocks in a satellite go wrong, space scientists have to launch a backup satellite equipped with new atomic clocks
 isi vajah se isro ke liye bharat main aisi ghadiyaan viksit karnaa jaruri ho gaya
 With this homegrown atomic clock, ISRO has joined select space organizations in the world that have developed such sophisticated technology, says SAC director Tapan Mishra
 12 april ko isro ne bharat ke pehle nauvahan upgrah iaraneses 1e kii jagah lene ke liye safaltaapurvak iaraneses-1ai prakshepit kiya
 This would complete the grouping of seven satellites, so that the navigator would continue to operate smoothly
 ummid he ki yah bharat ko ek upgrah aadhaarit nauvahan pranali uplabdh karaayega jo ki america niyantrit global pojishning system (jeepies) se swatantra hogi
 The homegrown atomic clock will also be a step towards indigenous GPS

 keval watch on karne ke baad smartphone main bluetooth on rakhana he or Wear OS ap ko downlod kar aage kii bataai gai prakriya par dhyaan dena he
 Its storage is 4GB and RAM is 512MB
 saath hi ye 5 ATM water racistant he
 Performance and Battery: Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor was used in Explorist HR
 is nae smartwatch main nae 3100 plateform kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 It has wearos for the software part
 overol parformens kii baat karen to ye pichhali watch kii tulana main jaraa sa fast he, lekin samsung, aipal or huaave jaise smartwatch kii tulana main abhi bhi kuch had tak slo he
 Keep in mind that there is not too much slow that you can not access it easily
 iske UI main pehle kii tulana main sudhaar he, lekin procesar main phir bhi itnaa sudhaar nahin dekhne ko mila he
 You can use Google Assistant or want to use Google Fit
 aapako overol oparation main thodaa lag jarur feel hoga
 That is, this watch does not look smooth
 ek taraf ye smartwatch nae plateform or nae OS ke saath utaari gai he, lekin pratidwandi companiyon kii tulana main abhi bhi isamen kaaphi kaam karne kii jarurat he
 a lot of functions can be done through this watch
 watch se hi massej riplai karnaa, google assistant se information lenaa, map nevigate karnaa, mujeec player istemaal karnaa or flashlite on karne jaise kai kaam kiye ja sakate hai
 Talking about the battery, here too this smartwatch has not been able to do much better than the previous watch
 aap ise 24 ghanton tak hi chalaa sakate hai
 In such a situation, if your focus is specifically for fitness, then you can move to a smartwatch like Fit Versa Lite at a lower price
 kyonki yahaan 4 ghante tak kii bydaree milti he
 Verdict: If you don't want to take a watch just for fitness then this is for you
 premium luk or linewet hona isaki khaas baton main se ek he
 Also, many features like different watch face, Always on display, screen lock, Google Assistant support, NFC and Google Play store also make it special
 yani agar aap nae smartwatch yujar hai or kai fitures ke saath premium luk vaali watch bajet main chaahate hai to isamen paisa laga sakate hai
