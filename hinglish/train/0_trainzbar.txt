 pakistan main bhartiya rajdoot sabharwal ne pichley saal 26 november ko mumbai main hue aatankwaadi hamale ke sambandh main pakistan ke jaanch par malik se uski naveenatam report lee

 sawaal ye bhi he ki agar sarkaar manaregaa ke tahat hone vaale kaam ke liye pehle hi paisa release nahin karegi to kaam ke avasar kaise paidaa honge
 Before the World T20, Team India has got answers to almost all its questions
 deth over kii gutthi bumraah ne sulajhaa di he
 The problem of the all-rounder has been resolved after the batting of Hardik Pandya
 9wein number par aswin team kii ballebaazi takat ko darshata he
 In spin bowling, there are options for Raina, Yuvraj with ashwin-jadeja and Finisher's role will play batsmen like dhoni-raina, but one question that still remains is about the batting of Yuvraj, to which Captain Dhoni himself said Is that they cannot hit sixes and fours as soon as they come straight
 wo aise ballebaaj hai, jo lambey hit laga sakate hai, lekin settle hone main unhen kuch samay lagata he
 The comments saath hi dhoni ne ye bhi kaha ki yuvaraj is samay top four main feet nahin hote
 After the openers are Virat, then Raina and they are in excellent form
 aise main yuvaraj ko unke baad hi ballebaaji kerani hogi
 Meaning clearly, captain Dhoni has decided the playing eleven of the World Cup and Rahane will have to go out if Virat comes in the current team
 aise main agle match main agar captain rahane kii jagah yuvaraj ko ballebaaji kram main upar bhej den, to koi chaunkane vaali baat nahin hogi
 The result of the series will be decided in Visakhapatnam and it will be interesting to see if captain Dhoni, who is not known to make much changes, will give a chance to a player like Negi in view of the World Cup
 spin gendbaaji main aswin-jadeja ke saath raina, yuvaraj ke vikalp maujuud hai or finisher kaa role dhoni-raina jaise ballebaaz nibhaayenge, lekin ek sawaal jo ab bhi barkaraar he, wo yuvaraj kii ballebaaji ko lekar he, jis par khud captain dhoni ne kaha he ki wo sidhaa aate hi chakke-chauke nahin laga sakate
 He is a batsman who can hit long hits, but it takes him some time to settle down
 tippaniyan Also, Dhoni also said that Yuvraj does not fit in the top four at this time
 salaami ballebaajon ke baad viraat hai, phir raina or wo shandaar form main hai
 In such a situation, Yuvraj will have to bat only after him
 matlab saaf he, captain dhoni ne vishwa cap kii plaing ilevan tay kar lee he or maujuuda team main viraat ke aane par rahane ko baahar janaa hoga
 In such a situation, if you send Yuvraj up the batting order in place of captain Rahane, then there will be no surprise
 vishakhapatnam main siries kaa nateeja tay hoga or captain dhoni jo zyada badlaav karne ke liye nahin jane jate wo kya vishwacap ke maddenjar negi jaise khilaadi ko mauka denge, ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga

 Modi sees our work rather than our manner of speaking

 jab ham apni reliyon main lathi laate the to vah mahatma gandhi kii lathi kii tarah chalane kaa sahaara thi
 But now all the lathis are with the Nitish government
 aap ginati nahin kar sakate ki in laathiyon se apane haq kii maang kar rahe adhyapakon, auraton, chaatro, berozegaron or sarkari karmchaariyon ko kitni baar peeta gaya he
 "this statement was not about a seasoned politician of the RJD, but of a youth who has been prepared to handle his father's political legacy
" argedy ke shasankaal main media ko lalu prasad yadav se asahaj sawaal poochne kii ijaajat nahin thi, lekin ab media himmat karke aise sawaal karne laga tha, jo argedy netaaon ko kaaphi pareshaan karne vaale the
 One such question was - will the rally attendees bring lathis this time too, as they did in Lalu's lathi rally in April 2003
 argedy ke bade netaaon ko is kataaksh bhare sawaal kaa koi jawaab sujh nahin rahaa tha
 But then the answer given by Lalu's younger son Tejashwi Yadav intervened, the leaders standing there were also surprised
 halki dadhi, chote bal or ab amuman apane pita kii tarah hi collar yukt kurta-pajama pahanane vaale 24 varshiya tejasvi ne nitish raaj main logon par hue lathicharge kaa puraa byora saamne rakh diya
 This professional style of Lalu's son, who is known for his sarcastic style and sarcastic statements, has shocked politicians who are doing politics on the old lines
 desh kii rajdhani ke dilli public skool main pard chuke tejasvi lalu ke nau bacchon—saat betiyon or do beton—main aathvin santan hai
 They believe that they have worked hard to gain political understanding
 unka kahana he ki senior netaaon kii madad se hi ve paripakv hue hai
 Tejaswi, who uses a blackberry handset, gives his mobile number and says, "I listen to everyone
" aapako jab bhi lage, main kuch galat kar rahaa hum to mujhase baat kar sakate hai
 Today, the fiery Congress vice-president is a big fan of Rahul Gandhi and despite Lalu's conviction in the fodder scam, he has controlled himself along with other party leaders, while RJD leaders were desperate to attack the Congress
 ve congress ko argedy ke samarthan kaa bachaav karte hai, haalanki congress bihar main nitish sarkaar ko samarthan de rahi he
 In terms of age, he is not yet eligible to contest the Lok Sabha or Assembly elections, but Tejashwi is aware that attacking Lalu in jail can prove harmful
 july 1997 main bihar ke mukhyamantri kaa pad chhodkar jab lalu pehali baar jail gaye the to tejasvi sirf aath saal ke the
 "it was a very difficult period," he recalls
 mere mata-pita ne mujhe pareshaaniyon se dur rakhane ke liye mujhe padhgaye ke liye dilli bhej diya tha
 "but when Lalu went to jail this time, Tejashwi stood firmly behind him, as if he was making up for the old days
 lalu ne apane bade bete tej pratap se zyada tejasvi par bharosa kiya he
 Lalu had taken Tejashwi with him when he went to Ranchi a day before the CBI court's decision on 30 September
 ranchi main unke saath tejasvi parivaar ke akele sadsy the
 Lalu knew that only Tejashwi can control his feelings
 faisle vaale din tejasvi jaldi se adaalat se baahar nikal aae or unhone maa rabari devi ko phone par faisle kii jaankaree di
 Then came back and put his hand on father's shoulder and tied him up
 jab lalu ko jail le jaaya gaya to tejasvi ne napa-tula jawaab diya, adaalat ke faisle ko upree adaalat main chunauti di jaaegi
 Though there were tears in the eyes of leaders like Rajya Sabha MP Ram Kripal Yadav, Tejashwi kept full control of his feelings
 raajnneeti main tejasvi ke aane ke baad pichley teen varshon main argedy ne lanbaa rasta tay kar liya he
 In the old days of RJD, Lalu used to make fun of computers and information technology, but now his party website has been created, which is regularly updated
 tejasvi ke kuch computer premi dost hai, jo unase milane waalon kaa samay tay karne, argedy kaa fasebuk profile apadet karne or sandesh bhejne main unki madad karte hai
 Before joining politics, Tejashwi tried his luck on the cricket pitch
 dilli kii ore se unhone under-19 ke liye kai match khele
 But even after being selected by the Daredevils in the IPL, he never got a chance to try the bat
 is par lalu ne didisie ke adhyaksh or bijepi netaa arun jetali ko khub kosa tha, ''mere bete ko maidan par khiladinnon ko sirf ek baar pani pilaane kaa mauka mila, use khilne nahin diya gaya
 Tejashwi himself was upset with this disinterest
 lekin ab unki chunauti jatiyon main banty bihar kii oobad-khabad raajnneeti kii pich par khud ko sabit karne kii he, jahaan pita kii viraasat kii vajah se unhen romaanchak mauka mila he
 However, Tejashwi's debut in politics has been very disappointing
 sitambar 2010 main lalu apni ek press conference main pehali baar unhen apane saath le gaye the
 This was his first step in politics
 tejasvi ne 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main maa rabari devi or kuch anya netaaon ke liye prachaar kiya tha, lekin us chunaav main party ko karaari shikast mili or 243 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main uski siten 54 se ghatakar mahaj 22 rah gayi
 Rabri contested two seats, but lost on both
 ve kehete hai, ''ek prakaar se yah acha hi anubhav tha
 i was not ready at all
 shuruaati safalataa ke mukaable shuruaati vifaltaa hameshaa hi acchhee hoti he
 Unlike his elder brother 26-year-old Tej Pratap, Tejaswi has been interested in grassroots programs
 tej kabhi-kabhi chaatr raajnneeti main hissaa lete hai
 "laluji sees his image in his younger son," says a senior party leader
 tejasvi party kii yuva shakha kaa kaam bhi dekhte hai
 Having already been active in 20 districts, they will soon start the next phase of their journey
 ” ve aise samay main lalu ke uttaradhikari banakar ubhar rahe hai, jab nitish sarkaar kii lokapriyata daanv par he
 The rjd's anti-bjp and JD-U have a figure of thirty-six and the RJD may benefit the most from this sharing of votes
 iske alaava lalu ko sajaa hone se sahanubhuti ke chalate unke samarthak ekajute ho sakate hai
 However, the biggest challenge before Tejashwi this time is to keep his party active in the absence of his father
 ve bihar ke yuva votaron ko aakarshith kar sakate hai
 a large number of these young voters are first time voters
 haalanki lalu yadav ke voter puure man se tejasvi ko unka uttaradhikari maanate hai, lekin party ke senior netaa aisa nahin chaahate
 Tejashwi is repeatedly saying that Lalu will remain the party's surveyor
 udhar rabari bhi party kaa netritv apane haath main lene ke daawey se peeche hat gai hai
 The three RJD mps in the Lok Sabha - Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Prabhunath Singh and Jagadanand Singh - are very senior, who would hardly accept Tejashwi as the party chief
 tejasvi bhi is baat ko samajhate hai, isliye unhone philhal khud ko yuva shakha tak hi simit rakhaa he
 But they are working on a long-term plan
 tejasvi yah bhi bharosa dilaanaa chaahate hai ki uttaradhikaar ko lekar parivaar main koi anban nahin he
 He says, "lalu ji is our leader
 ” haalanki rajnatik halkon main charchaa he ki lalu kii priy beti misa bhi 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav lard sakati hai
 Tejashwi may not be as adept at giving sharp answers as his father, but he is in favor of clean politics
 party main unhen kabhi bhi kisi par naaraaz hote nahin dekha gaya he
 Contrary to his elder sister Misa with a strong temper, or elder brother Tej Pratap, who is busy in Holi, he is a young with a moderate temperament

 On the other hand, the Congress has tightened up on this saying that BJP is a party promoting money

 congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv jyotiraditya sindhiya neparty kii vartmaan sthiti ko lekar ek bada diya he
 Jyotiraditya said that the Congress needs self-observation and it is the need of the hour to improve the situation of the party today
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki maharashtra main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko safalataa milegi or hamaari party vahaan par satta main aegi
 Let me tell you that this statement of Jyotiraditya Scindia came at a time when he was asked by party leader Salman Khurshid to speak about the bad situation of Congress
 sawaal ke jawaab main sindhiya ne pehle to kaha ki vah kisi ke bayaan par pratikriya nahin dete hai
 However, soon after that he said, "but it is true that the Congress needs self-observation
" party kii jo sthiti he, usamen jayja lekar sudhaar karnaa chahie or yah samay kii maang he
 With this, about the elections for Maharashtra Legislative Assembly this month, Scindia said, 'my work was limited to the screening committee there
 vahaan par varisht netaa mallikanurjan khadge ke saath pradesh adhyaksh or kai varisht netaa hai
 All the leaders are working together and the Congress will get success there
 ' bataa den ki sindhiya ek hafte ke gwalior-chambal sambhag ke daure par hai or is dauraan ve kai saamaajik evam raajnneetik kaaryakramon main hissaa le rahe hai

 Mumbai Police wants Hamza's custody while Delhi Police opposes the application
 jab se abu hamaja kii giraftaar hui he tab se giraftaar ko lekar kai tarah ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 Indian agencies got a major breakthrough in this case in 2010 when the terrorist accused of the Pune blasts, Lal Baba, identified the voice of Jabiuddin alias Hamza
 hamaja kii aawaaj kii pushti ho jane ke baad jab tak jaanch agenciyaan us tak pahunchati tab tak vah paak vija par pehle pakistan or phir saudi arab ja chukaa tha
 After Hamza went to Saudi Arabia, there was pressure on Pakistan's government not to send Zabiuddin to India in any case, but India claimed that Zabiuddin is a citizen of India
 uske gharavaalon ke khun ke namoonay vahaan bheje gaye
 This was proved right after the DNA test of Jabiuddin alias Abu Jindal
 aakhirkaar 21 june ko jabiuddin urf abu jindal urf abu hamaja ko bharat laayaa gaya
 Now it is also coming to light that the Ministry of External Affairs remained completely unaware of such a long process of arrest of Abu Hamza, although the first statement from the government after the arrest of Abu Hamza was from the Foreign Minister SM Krishna but now from sources It is coming to light that SM Krishna himself got information about the arrest of Abu Hamza from TV channels
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is puri muhim se videsh mantralay bekhbar rahaa
 The comments saal 2006 main aurangabad se 30 kilo ardex 10 eke 47, 2000 kaartoos baraamad kiye gaye the
 In this case too, Jabiuddin Ansari's alias Hamza's name came up, but according to sources, Hamza stayed with his partner for some time at the MLA Hostel in Mumbai after the incident
 emele hostel kaa yah cameraa us vakt maujuuda schuli shiksha rajya mantri or us vakt vidhayak phojia khan ke naam tha

 Indian agencies got a major breakthrough in this case in 2010 when the terrorist accused of the Pune blasts, Lal Baba, identified the voice of Jabiuddin alias Hamza

 Kargil Jung lost all the edge that Vajpayee's Lahore bus journey diplomacy achieved
 pakistan ke saath sthaayee shanti ke prati ve khaase patibaddh the, iske baavjood pakistan ne jab bhartiya seemaa par kabje kii apni aakraamak manshaa apratyaashit rup se jaahir kii to pakistan ke saath yuddh ke raste main ve katai aade nahin aemai 1999 main kargil main pakistan kii ghuspaith, vah bhi pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii lahore yatra or lahore ghoshnaptr par dastakhat ke fouran baad, har kisi ke liye aashcharya kii baat thi
 But Vajpayee himself was most surprised by this
 hamen jang kii taraf le jane vaale prastaavon par raay-mashvira karte vakt bhi ve navaj sharif or pakistan kii manshaa ko samajhane kii koshish kar rahe the
 Immediately on 17 May 1999, he gave his interlocutor R
K
 ke
 Mishra sent to Islamabad to complain about infiltration from Sharif; Mishra also alleged that while signing the Lahore Declaration, Sharif was aware of Kargil's intentions
 mere unhen tafasil se jaankaree dene or teenon senaaon kii aguai main 23 may, 1999 ko oparation vijay kii shuruyaat ke baad unhen bharosa ho gaya ki pakistan ne vishwasghaat kiya tha
 He declared that "this new situation was not an intrusion but an initiative to occupy Indian land
" kargil ke ilaake ko chhudaane ke liye sabhi kadam uthaae jaaenge
 "he called Sharif and said" we will not allow any intrusion
 
 
 balpurvak apni jameen khaali karavaaenge
 In the first week of June, Vajpayee made a public statement (for the second time) that India would not cross the international border or the Line of Control (loc); This reference condition was given to us
 bayaan kaa matlab yah bhi tha ki hamaari sainya ranneeti ke haath baandh die gaye the
 i raised this issue with the Prime Minister and requested him not to say this in public
 maine kaha ki suraksha par cabinet cameti (sisies) kii hidaayaton kaa paalan kiya hi ja rahaa he
 However, if we are not able to drive out the intruders, the army will have no option but to cross the Line of Control
 maine poocha ki agar tab ham yah guzarish lekar aae, to aapkaa jawaab kya hoga? vaajapeyi ne tab to jawaab nahin diya par shaam ko rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar brajesh mishra ne ek tivi channel ke saath unke intervyuu kaa intjaam kiya
 In it, he said, "the matter of not crossing the border and the Line of Control is fine for today
 par hamen nahin pataa, kal kya hoga
 "the day of July 8, 1999 was very eventful
 pradhanmantri ne mujhe apane awaas par bulaayaa
 They told me that Pakistan had agreed to call back its forces across the Line of Control and they wanted to know my reaction
 meri fori pratikriya yahi thi ki yah sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 i said that the armed forces have lost many lives
 ab jab chijen hamaare haq main badal chuki hai, to ham dushman ko bhaagane kaa rasta kyon den? kuch ghanton baad phir phone aayaa or mujhe bulaayaa gaya
 This time he asked me how much more time it would take to drive out the other Pakistani intruders
 maine kaha ki do se teen hafte lag sakate hai
 Then he mentioned that we have already lost many lives, should we lose more? i told them that we are fighting the war of someone else
 kuch or mauton kii ashanka se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 However, i have to consult my COSC (chief of Staff Committee) on this issue
 vaajapeyi ne mujhase yah bhi kaha ki sanvaidhanik jarurat ke mutabik, desh ko sansad ke chunaav bhi karwaane hai
 In the meantime, i immediately summoned the COSC colleagues, the Vice Chief of the Army Staff and the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) for a meeting
 hamane tamaam sambhavit nateezon par baatcheet kii or usee vakt dijiemo ne uttari kaman ke commander se phone par baat kii
 Many questions were raised — should we accept the proposal of the Pakistani troops to return? If so, what will be its political and military consequences? How will the Pakistani forces act during the return? What events can we face suddenly and how should we prepare ourselves to deal with them? By then the political situation had changed
 agar ham jang jari rakhte to vah antarrashtriya or gharelu samarthan ganvaa sakate the jo hame hasil hua tha
 When political objectives are achieved in a war, it is no longer a means to continue
 hamen gaharaa andeh tha ki pakistani fouj peeche hategi yaa nahin
 They could not be trusted
 lambii baatcheet ke baad ham raji the ki ham hamaare die vakt or praathamikta ke mutabik pakistani phujon kii charanbaddh vaapasi sweekaar kar sakate hai
 That evening, when i was called for the third time at pm's residence, i told him my recommendations and conditions

 (IANS or ANI input ke saath) The new TRAI rule has been implemented and some users are still expressing their concerns on social media
 DTH ko lekar TRAI ke nae niyam ko is makasad se lagu kiya gaya he ki yugers ko tivi channels dekhne par control mil sakegaa
 Along with this, it hoped to be cheap
 lekin kai logon ke liye ye niyam ulta padataa hua dikhaai de rahaa he
 TRAI believes that this will reduce the bill of customers, as customers will only pay for the channels they would like to see
 haalanki aise kai logon ke liye nahin he
 According to estimates by global analytics and rating company Crisil, this DTH rule, implemented by the Telecom Authority of India (TRAI), may cost customers more than before
 base pack, aid ons, network capacity fee or taxes mila kar customers kaa bill pehle se zyada aa saktaa he
 This is the estimate of this rating agency and it is being told that trai's promise can create a reverse situation and increase the bill of customers
 TRAI kii nai regaullation ke tahat broadcasters ne kaaphi stretiji ke saath prising kii he
 The more popular and reachable channels cost more
 kuch popular channels kii keemat 19 rupay he or is agar is tarah ke 10 channel bhi aapane chun liye to aapkaa bill pehle ke pack se zyada aa saktaa he
 Sachin Gupta, Senior Director, Cirsil has said, 'our analysis of the impact of this regulation shows that monthly TV bills can be affected
 maujuuda prising ke aadhaar par manthali bill 25 fisadi tak bad saktaa he
 Earlier, it was Rs 230-340, now it can be Rs 300 per month, which viewers opt for 10 channels
 haalanki agar 5 channel lete hai to keemat kam ho jaaegi’ 
 Due to this new rule, even after paying more money to the customers, less channels are getting
 aalaa cart basis nishchit taur par aapako chhot detaa he ki aap koun se channel ke dekhnaa chahen or kiske liye paise den
 But on the other hand, the number and channels will be reduced considerably and the choice will be reduced, the options will also be reduced

 Not only the people living here due to parking problem in Delhi, but the metro which has become the identity of Delhi in the country and the world is also aware of this acute problem
 lekin dilli metro ne public transport main kranti laane ke liye kai kamaal kiye hai or takneekee ke boote kiye hai, isiilie is samasya ko bhi dilli metro ne apane hi andaaz main sulajhaa liya
 Actually, the construction of the new line of Delhi Metro started between Janakpuri and Kalindi Kunj, then there was a shortage of space in Okhla Jamia area on this route, because the Delhi Metro was not just to make the line but to build the station and then the train depot
 It also requires space
 depo ke liedilli metro ko zyada jagah chahiehoti he, kyonki metro ke depo main na sirf trainon kii dekharekh hoti he, balki yahaan us vakt metro trainon ko park kiya jaataa he, jab wo commercial oparation main nahin hoti hai
 When the work started on the Magenta Line of the metro, the area of kalindi Kunj was fixed for the depot
 kyonki yahi vah ilaaka tha, jahaan kuch jagah uplabdh thi
 But the metro needed more space than it got
 metro ke ejiniers ne dimag lagaaya or ek kamaal phir hua
 This time the metro set an example of architecture and along with Kalindi Kunj, it made space for parking the Metro in the air near Jasola Vihar station adjacent to it

 Amidst the debate started in the capital Delhi about vehicles with even and odd number number plates, it will be important to remember that such an attempt was also made in metropolitan Mumbai, which could not succeed
 is vajah se mumbai kii trephic sudharte-sudharte rah gai
 While hearing a PIL, on the order of Bombay High Court, the committee headed by the then Transport Secretary Vinay Mohan Lal in 2000 had said that traffic should be controlled in Mumbai from Monday to Friday on the basis of number plate
 somvaar ko 1 or 2 to, mangalvaar ko 3 or 4 number jin kaaron ke numberplate par aakhir main hai, wo gaadiyaan sadakon par nahin chal sakengi
 In this way, the number 1 to 0 will be split at the end of five days a week
 shanivaar or ravivaar or saarvajanik chhuttiyon ke din ye niyam lagu nahin hoga
 The rule will also apply to all private and two-wheelers except government
 iske alaava bheed bhare ilaakon main peak time main gaadi le jane par zyada paise dene honge
 However, not a single suggestion could materialize
 ritred ipies dow pies pasrichaa laal kamity ke sadsy rah chuke hai
 He himself has done phd on traffic issues
 unhone NDTV india se baatcheet main kaha ki samiti ne apni siforishein hoicourt ke saamne rakhin
 On which the court asked the then government and the government did not accept the recommendation of the Lal Committee
 isse mumbai kii trephic main badlaav mumkin nahin ho sake
 The comments maharashtra main tab congress-ensipi kii sarkaar thi, jo in siforeeshon ko lagu karne kii himmat nahin juta saki
 If this suggestion were implemented, a city like Mumbai, which is spread from south to north, would have reduced the traffic by 20%
 jaankaar kehete hai ki ab aisi ummid keval kuch badlaav sakhti se lagu karne se hi bachi he
 Traffic expert Ashok Datar says that even if you give better public transport, where is the road left to run buses? Roads are being occupied for parking faster than the population
 isliye nijee gadiyon kii sankhya par niyantran jaruri he
 But no government has the courage to say this
 karnaa to chhod hi dijie
 Datar claims that while the population in Mumbai is growing at a negligible rate, private vehicles growing at the rate of 13 per cent are phasing out parking space at 30 per cent
 aise main badlaav kaa intjaar karte-karte mumbai kii aabhohawaa main nitrogen kii maatra pichley dashak main dugani ho chuki he
 The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board report has stated this
 ek janhit yachika kii sunwaayee karte hue bombai hoicourt ke aadesh par tatkaaleen parivahan sachiv vinay mohan laal kii adhyakshata main san 2000 main bani kamity ne kaha tha ki mumbai main somvaar se shuukravaar tak number plate ke aadhaar par trephic niyantrit ho
 Cars 1 and 2 on Monday, 3 and 4 on Tuesday, cars whose numbers are finally on the carts will not be able to walk on the roads
 is tarah se 1 se 0 number aakhir main hone vaali gadiyon kaa hafte ke paanch dinon main vibhaajan hoga
 This rule will not be applicable on Saturdays and Sundays and public holidays
 niyam sarkari chhod sabhi nijee or dupahiyaa vaahanon par bhi lagu hoga
 Apart from this, more money will have to be paid for taking the car in peak time in crowded areas
 lekin, isamen se ek bhi suzav amal main aa na sakaa

 Due to this, changes in Mumbai's traffic could not be possible
 tippaniyan There was then a congress-ncp government in Maharashtra, which could not muster the courage to implement these recommendations
 agar yah suzav lagu hota mumbai mumbai jaise dakshin se uttar disha main faile shahar main 20% trephic kam ho jaataa
 Experts say that now such an expectation has survived only by strictly implementing some changes

 Therefore, it is necessary to control the number of private trains

 AIADMK mps created a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha today over the claim of supreme court ke jaj or madras hoicourt ke chif justise rahe markandeya katju ke daawey ko lekar aaj rajyasabha main ediemke saansadon ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya, jiske chalate sadan kii kaarywahi rokani padi
 On the other hand, AIADMK mps also raised this issue in the Lok Sabha
 justise katju enditivi kaa intervyuu adhuraa chhodkar chale gaye, jab unase poocha gaya ki unhone 10 saal baad is maamle ko kyon uthaaya
 Justice Katju claims that a corrupt judge was promoted to save the UPA government from falling
 justise katju ke mutabik, jab vah jaj jila jaj the to unke kaamkaaj ko lekar madras hoicourt ke kai jajon ne pratikul tippaniyan kii thim, lekin madras hoicourt ke tatkaaleen chif justise ne apni kalam kii takat se ek hi jatke main sari pratikul tippaniyon ko hataa diya or yah jaj hoicourt main adishnal jaj ban gaye
 Justice Katju says that he remained in the same position until he went to the Madras High Court in November 2004
 is jaj ko tamilnadu ke ek bade netaa kaa samarthan hasil tha, kyonki is jaj ne kabhi use jamaanat di thi
 Justice Katju says that after receiving several reports of corruption about this judge, he requested the Chief Justice of India RC Lohati to conduct a secret inquiry against this judge
 baad main justise lohati ne phone par bataaya ki ibi ko us jaj ke khilaaf paryaapt saboot mili hai
 Justice Katju says he was surprised when his tenure as additional judge was extended for a year instead of acting on it
 justise katju kaa kahana he ki darasal supreme court kii kolligium ne ibi report ke aadhaar par us jaj ko aage niyukt na karne kii sifarish kendra kii upie sarkaar ko bheji thi, lekin sarkaar ko samarthan de rahi tamilnadu kii ek party ne is sifarish kaa joardaar virodh kiya or us party ke mantriyon ne manmohan singh ko unki sarkaar giraane kii dhamkee bhi di thi
 Former Chief Justice of India and now chairman of the National Human Rights Commission Justice KG Balakrishnan has reacted to the case
 unka kahana he ki maine madras hoicourt ke chif justise kii sifarish ke baad jaj ko sthaayee kiya tha
 In the case of appointment of judges, the Supreme Court's collegium decides, but the case of permanent judges does not go to the collegium, so i made them permanent based on the report of the Chief Justice of Madras High Court
 ye aarope lage the ki vah jaj sattarudh party ke kareeb he isliye sthaayee karne ke baad maine unka tabadalaa andhra pradesh kar diya tha
 At the same time, the Congress says that Katju keeps making such statements to stay in the news
 congress pravaktaa raashid alvi ne yah bhi kaha ki maujuuda sarkaar ke kareeb aane ke liye justise katju ne yah bayaan diya he
 But Hansraj Bhardwaj, who was the law minister during the UPA regime, agreed to Katju's statement and said that there is pressure in the alliance
 vahiin sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki centre sarkaar justise katju ke bayaan par koi pratikriya nahin dena chaahati
 According to the NDA government, it is a matter of the old government and the judiciary should take a decision on it

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Finance Minister p Chidambaram arrived in Jaipur on Saturday to participate in an event organized at Dudu on the second anniversary of the Unique Identification Number number 'aadhaar'

 Aadhar card will reduce corruption
 'ye donon log vishesh vimaan se dilli se jaipur ke sanganer hawaii adde par chaak chauband suraksha prabandh ke bich pahunche
 This is the first time Manmohan and Sonia Gandhi have arrived in Jaipur on a trip to Rajasthan for a few hours together
 pradhanmantri or sonia gandhi vishesh helicopter se dudu ke liye ravaanaa ho gayi
 At the airport, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot received the Prime Minister and the UPA Chairperson

 Where this program was held, it is also the Lok Sabha constituency of Union Minister of State Sachin Pilot and the Legislative Assembly constituency of Rajasthan's Minister of State for Khadi and Rural Industries Babu Lal Nagar

 Prasad said that this time politics in the name of religion and caste has become secondary and people are coming forward to vote in the name of development
 unhone kaha ham keval samprag sarkaar kii paanch saal kii uplabdhiyon ko lekar janata ke bich ja rahe hai or dharm jati jaise muddon ko garm karnaa hamaari raajnneeti kaa hissaa nahin he

 It is possible that UPA still has time, but if they want to show their foresight by altering the cabinet, then it will be said that their power of thinking has been lost

 In this desolation, there is no hero holding a magic wand in his hands, who can compete with the writings written on the pages of history
 aisa koi nahin jo congress shasit dilli or guwahati ke bich ek sira talashkar use ek aisa nitigat swaroop de sake jiskaa phaha purvottar ke jakhmon ko bhar de
 His government's response to corruption is something like - remove the dust on your shoulder, then double the dust on the opponents; If our face is black with corruption, then bjp's face is also black
 ho saktaa he yah sach ho, lekin isse kya un mantriyon kaa aparaadh kam ho jayega jinhone apane-apane congressi yaa bhaajapai dost-naatedaaron ko koyala khadaan aavantit kin?in sabake bich rahul gandhi ke congress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh yaa cabinet mantri ke rup main satta ke galiyare main pravesh karne kii sambhaavna se utsukata bani rahati he
 But this raises a question
 pichley aath barason main rahul gandhi kya kabhi satta se dur rahe? jab bhi unhone jo kaam karnaa chaha kiya
 He was always sitting on the stage like the working president of the Congress
 jab bhi unhone koi faisla kiya, use sarkaar yaa party str par lagu kiya gaya
 Imposed wherever they could for the younger generation of Chief Ministers; And made him sit on a chair in Kashmir and Andhra
 unhone yuva congress ke jariye party main krantikari badlaav laana chaha, kisi ne unhen nahin roka
 He wanted to campaign the party in Bihar himself by choosing a candidate from his list, so he did
 uttar pradesh main kuch or siten paane kii ummid main unhone apane thile se sari lubhaavni chijen nikaalkar daanv par laga deen
 They kept on moving forward
 lekin har baar nateeja bura nahin to niraashajanak to rahaa hi
 But he was never held accountable for this
 rajeev gandhi us samay bhi itane prabhaavshaalee nahin the jab unki maa, indira gandhi pradhanmantri thim
 All big and small leaders of the Congress, with a resolution, have considered Rahul Gandhi as the successor and pride of the Congress; This is the new vow of swearing for loyalty
 rahul gandhi ko puri chhot he ki ve jo mantralay yaa jimmaa lenaa chahen, le sakate hai
 He can become the Home Minister this week and can overcome the problems of Assam and Telangana with his ability
 agar ve pradhanmantri banate hai to ye donon hi mudde unke agenda main sabase upar rahenge
 That moment is very important in the life of a young MP when he is invited by the Prime Minister to join the government
 lekin us shaks ke liye iskaa koi matlab nahin jo cabinet ko sidhe taur par yaa apni maa kii paroksh satta ke jariye niyantrit kar rahaa ho
 If there is any spark in the possible September reshuffle, it will come from the states
 raajnneeti kii beshumaar afvaahon kaa shahar bani dilli maanati he ki congress andhra pradesh, rajasthan or maharashtra main apane mukhyamantriyon ko badal daalegi
 If this is true, it does not mean that such a decision was taken after being happy with their work, but rather the failure of all three
 kahin se bhi yah kaabiliyat kaa wajipha nahin
 The failure may have dictated the role of a tough decision for Prithviraj Chavan, but Ashok Gehlot and Kiran Reddy have long since left

 For example, Sharad Pawar can become a good home minister

 Perhaps Sharad Pawar, seeing the plight of his surroundings, would be saying something similar: Thank you, Prime Minister, i am not the Prime Minister

 Through extensive interrogation of these two terrorists, the ATS wants to know who and how the IED used for the blast was prepared? - From where and who provided the gunpowder? And from where was he stolen? - Who and who provided the money through hawala for the blast? - When and how was the conspiracy to bomb the blast? - What is the relationship of both of them to the Indian Mujahideen ? - In the future, where was the intention of the two of them to explode? For this investigation, the court has sent Bhatkal and Tabrez to ATS custody till 18 February
 sarkari vakil ujjwal nikam ne bataaya, ‘donon hi khoonkhaar aatankiyon ko jabardast suraksha ke bich adaalat main pesh kiya gaya
 While Yasin Bhatkal was smiling on one side in the court, there was a clear sense of fear on Asadullah's face
 donon ne guzarish kii ki unhen hathkadi naa lagaai jaae lekin unke upar khatre ko dekhte hue adaalat ne unki maang ko thukaraate hue kaha kii ek jagah se duusari jagah jab donon aatankiyon ko lekar jaaya jaae, tab unhen hathkadi main hi rakhaa jaae
 Now everyone's eyes are on the ATS, does anything come out after the inquiry? ' sawan ke pehle somvaar ke din dwadash jyotirlingon main pramukh sthaan rakhane vaale baba kaashi vishwanath kii nagari kaashi main shiv bhakton kaa sailaab aa gaya he

 sawan main kanvadiyon ke baari sankhya main aane ke maddenjar suraksha ke vyapak intjaam kiye gaye hai
 In this town of Bhole, there is a gathering of whole Sawan devotees
 manyata he ki 12 jyotirlongon main ahm sthaan rakhane vaale baba vishwanath ko yadi sawan ke pehle somvaar jal chadhaaya jaae to manushya ko moksh kii prapti hoti he
 The importance of Kankhan in Sawan is that Shiva resides in his in-law Kankhal only for the entire month of Sawan, from here, he manages the creation and welfare of the people
 sawan ke pehle somvaar haridwar ke shiv mandiron main bhole shiv kaa jalabhishek karne ke liye shraddhaluon kaa tantaa lagata he
 Shiva devotees are doing the Jalabhisheka of Bhole
 kaha jaataa he ki samudr manthan ke baad jab chandramaa raahu se bachakar bhaag rahe the, to unhen shiv ne hi abhaydaan diya tha
 Shiva wore the moon on his head
 tab chandra ne apana priy somvaar shiv ko arpit kar diya tha or kaha tha ki jo bhi somvaar ke din shiv kaa jalabhishek karegaa, uski sabhi manokamanaayen puri hongi
 Pandit Vishveshwarananda, priest of the Daksheshwar Mahadev temple Kankhal, says, 'since this is the in-laws of Lord Shankar, this temple of the earth is important in all the peeths

 varun gandhi or unki team sultanpur ke gramin ilaake main gaddhon se bhari sadak se guzarati he to pradhanmantri gramin sadak yojana kaa sinboard jaise is yojana kaa makhul udaata najar aata he
 The 34-year-old BJP general secretary's convoy of about half-a-dozen suvs and jeeps is heading from Sultanpur town to Palia village as Varun's second election meeting is going on today
 unke nae nirvachan kshetra main paanch din ke chunavi daure kaa yah chauthaa din he
 Elections are to be held here on May 7

 unka kafila palia kii sankari galiyon se gujarata hua us jagah par jaakar ruk jaataa he, jahaan ek manch banaaya gaya he
 Varun descends with folded hands from the seat next to the driver and moves from the middle of some youth, chanting 'varun Gandhi Zindabad' and 'bharatiya Janata Party Zindabad'
 unhone kesaria gandhi tapiyaan laga rakhi hai, jin par ''modi for piem” ke naare likhe hue hai
 The saffron Gandhi cap with Modi's slogan seems contradictory in itself
 lekin yahi sach he kyonki ve ek taraf indira gandhi ke pote hai to duusari ore bijepi ke netaa hai
 Addressing the excited crowd, he says, "I have come here not just to win elections, but to give you a new kind of politics
" main yah nahin kahata hum ki main sone kii sadak banavaa duungaa, lekin main yuva hum or mehnatee hum
 i will do my best for you
 ” yahaan ve sirf chaar minute kaa bhaashan dete hai
 "my slogan is," he says at the Somnabhar village assembly, "support me and take your right
" ’ hindu-muslim or jati kii raajnneeti se bharat ko kuch bhi hasil nahin hua he
 While holding village to village elections, Varun does not mention what his party-led or Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's government will do for him
 ise vidambnaa hi kahenge ki bijepi jahaan modi kii lahar par savaar hokar rajya main sabase badi party banane kii ummid kar rahi he, vahiin varun dhara ke vipareet tairne kii koshish karte dikhaai dete hai or apane parivaar ke naam par daanv khel rahe hai

 us bhaashan ke liye unke khilaaf maamla bhi darj hua tha, lekin baad main chhod diya gaya tha
 He was among the few shortlisted candidates of the party winning elections from Uttar Pradesh
 us baar bijepi ko yahaan kii 80 siton main sirf 10 hi mili thim
 Although he denies that he ever gave a hate speech, he admits, "when i contested my first election, some people were offering me, some were pulling
 main shaayad sabhi ko khush karne kii koshish main tha
 "now they are trying to build their image
 ve kehete hai, ''sansad main pehle do saal ke liye main chupchaap rahaa or kai maamalon main khud ko nirdosh sabit karne main vyast rahaa
 Today i feel that i will not compromise with my personal thoughts at all costs
 ”varun 20 saal kii umr main hi apni mummy menka gandhi kii tarah bijepi main shaamil ho gaye the
 He says, "I wanted to go there for my mother
" ” bijepi ke liye nehru-gandhi parivaar kii nai peedi kaa sadsy kisi bade uphaar se kam nahin tha
 Though the party continued to give him several posts one after the other, he was never fully trusted
 haal hi main jab varun ne amethi main apane chachere bhai rahul ke swayan sahaayta samoohon kii tarif kii to yah avishvaas saaf dikhaai diya
 The BJP pressured them to make it clear that they were not praising Rahul or the Congress
 lekin unhone donon kii aalochana nahin kii
 On April 2, the day Sonia Gandhi was filing her papers from Rae Bareli, Varun came in the news headlines praising Amethi
 ve agar congress main hote to yah koi khabar nahin thi
 Varun, trapped between the nehru-gandhi legacy and the Sangh Parivar, now has to live with this reality

 a glimpse of the questions arising in the minds of the people was clearly visible on the faces of the people who came to the funeral of Sahni
 sabake jahan me ek hi sawaal ki behad shant or sulajhe dil vaale rajesh saahani aakhir aatmahatya kyon kii? aakhir aisa kya hua kii rajesh saahani ne ekaek apni sarvice revolver manga kar khud ko apane daftar ke bheetar hi goli maar lee
 These questions are arising in the minds of the people - the biggest question is, why did Rajesh Sahni come to his office despite being on leave? Service revolver manga shot and shot? - His people say that he was a very settled person
 aakhir kya hua ki unhen aatmahatya kerani padi?- kya unhen koi oficial problem thi? yaa phir gharelu uljhan se jujh rahe the?- unhone marane se pehle kis se aakhri baar baat kii thi?- aakhirkaar aties ke daftar me bagal ke kamare main rajesh saahani ke goli maarane ke baavjood kisi ko uski aawaaj sunai kyon nahi di?- jis kamare me rajesh ne goli maari us kamare me do daravaaje hai
 The front door was closed from the inside, but the back door had a latch on the outside, which opened easily
 aakhir aisa kaise?- rajesh saahani ke goli maarane ko bare me pataa chalate hi aties ke saathi unhen fouran aspataal lekar kyon nahin gaye?- goli lagane ke baad jaanch ke liye privet aspataal se doctor kyon bulaayaa gaya, jabaki lohia aspataal paas main hi he?- rajesh saahani kii deadbody chaar ghante aties ke daftar main hi kyon padi rahi?- jis dryver ne saahani ko revolver laakar di, use aakhir adhikari saamne aane se kyon roak rahe hai?- aakhirkaar itane sulajhe hue vyakti ne khudakushi se pehle koi sucite note kyon nahin choda?jaankaree ke mutabik, rajesh saahani kii beti kaa haal hi main mumbai ke mashuhar tata institute me admishan hua tha
 He was very happy about this
 iske liye 31 may ko mumbai jane vaale the
 In this case, the needle of suspicion also arises towards those cases of Rajesh, whose investigation was going on these days
 upi aties ne abhi chand dinon pehle uttarakhand ke pithauragarh se ramesh naamak ek apradhi ko pakadaa tha, jisapar aarope tha ki wo pakistan ke liye jasusi karata he
 It is said that the accused had accused the ATS of forgery by giving statements in the court
 isaki vajah se rajesh saahani tanaav me the
 Sources also say that SMS of his wife and daughter have also been received on Rajesh's mobile
 inase pataa chalata he ki rajesh saahani kii parivaar main kisi baat ko lekar gambhir bahes hui thi
 So, did any family dispute become an enemy of Rajesh Sahni's life? There are dozens of questions, which no officer has answered yet

 ) If honesty is the motto of the Aam Aadmi Party, what will be said if it is fake in the name of making a member in that party
 bihar main aam aadmi party kaa sadsy banane ke naam par farjivade ke maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 Many people were given receipts without numbers, while many people were given receipts of the same number
 yah sab tab hua, jab sadsy banane ke liye 10 rupee kii raseed di jaati thi
 Regardless of the claims of honesty that the AAP can make, the people present among them have exchanged money as soon as they get a chance
 is bare main AAP ke bihar prabharee somnath treepathi ne kaha, 'jo galati hui, wo shuru main hi pakadi gai
 Since the wrongdoer will be among himself, he thought that the plain receipt is going, so why should we not get the plain receipt printed
 
 
 'AAP ke bihar prabharee ke munh se kahi gai ye baaten sunakar aisa lagata he ki jo party eemaandaaree kaa paryaay bananaa chaahati he, vahiin farjivada ho rahaa he
 The fee was Rs 10 to gain membership in Bihar, it was fraudulent
 bisheshwar raay kii raseed par koi number nahin he, sirf 014 kaa code, jo ki puure bihar ke liye he
 On a membership receipt, the name is of Sunil, also the number, but there was only a complete bundle of the same number
 ek hi number se sainkadon sadsy bana die gaye
 The Sunil, who became a member of the AAP after seeing honesty, felt himself cheated
 darasal, yah farjivada tab se chaalu tha, jab 10 rupee lekar bihar ke har jilon main AAP ke member banane kaa abhiyaan shuru hua
 The AAP office of Delhi sent only 5 thousand receipts, but in Bihar, these receipts were printed in lakhs
 sarkaar banane ke baad har jile se roj hajaaron kii taadaad main AAP ke member banane kii khabaren aane lageen
 AAP is also believing that many people started membership drive by printing fake receipts
 AAP ke do bade netaa maanate hai ki sadsyta abhiyaan chalaane ke naam par gadabadi hui or mauka milte hi logon ne paise kii ugaahi kar lee, jiskaa hisaab nahin mila
 On the other hand, the membership campaigners are saying that not a single money has gone wrong and all the money has been kept somewhere
 jab dilli ke adhikari acount kholenge, to usamen puraa paisa daal diya jayega
 Suryadev Yadav, secretary of the party's Magadh range in Patna, said, "look, not even a pie has gone from here
 logon ne agal-alag jagahon par raseeden chhapavakar sadsyta abhiyaan chalaaya he or unheen logon ke paas paisa padaa he
 As soon as the account is arranged, money will be added to it
 'darasal bihar main AAP ke kai gut kaam kar rahe hai
 All the groups call themselves the real Aam Aadmi Party
 aise main kis gut ne kitni raseeden chhapavain or kitne member banawaye, isaki jaankaree hi nahin he
 There have been reports of fraud from many districts
 ab dekhnaa he ki AAP bihar main hue is farjivade se kaise nibatati he

 The merger of the two budgets is not expected to create any kind of issue
 yah mul rup se prakriyaatmak hi hoga

 imran ne aarope lagaaya ki ye bill donon deshon ke bich hue samjhaute ke khilaaf he
 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan tweeted and wrote, 'we oppose the citizenship bill passed by the Lok Sabha of India
 ye kanoon pakistan ke saath dwipaksheeya samjhaute or maanavadhikaar kanoon kaa ulanghan karata he
 This is the agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's Hindu Rashtra which is now being implemented by the Modi government

 iske baad ab rajasthan kaa mewar rajgharaana bhi bhagwaan shriram ke vanshaj hone kii ladaai main kud gaya he
 Mahendra Singh Mewar of Mewar royalty said that Mewar royal family is descended from Lord Rama's son Luv
 mewar ke purv rajkumaar lakshyaraj singh mewar kaa kahana he ki karnal james tod ne apni pustak 'enles and anticuities of rajasthan' main likhaa he ki shriram kii rajdhani ayodhya thi or unke bete lav ne lav kot yani lahore basaaya tha
 Love's descendants later came to Gujarat or Diet in Mewar where Sisodia kingdom was established
 mewar kaa raaj pratik surya he
 Shriram was also a worshiper of Shiva and the Mewar family is also a worshiper of Lord Shiva

 sharavati ko aaj shrivastav se janaa jaataa he jo uttar bharat main hai
 The secret of Kush lies in the skills of the South
 raghav ne kaha ki isse sabit hota he ki kush uttar bharat main nahin balki dakshin bharat main rahe, jabaki lav se raghav rajputon kaa janm hua he
 In this, the descent of Budgujar, Jayas, Sikarvars has gone, so we are descendants of Rama

 On his return, Federer said, "I wanted to play a little more in court, it was nice to come back
 main court main aane par bhavuk ho gaya tha or jaisaa sochaa usase behatar rahaa
 Although the 35-year-old Federer is excited about his comeback, he is taking small steps

 i got emotional upon coming to court and did better than i thought
 ' haalanki 35 saal ke federr apni vaapasi ko lekar utsahit zarur hai lekin kadam chote-chote uthaa rahe hai
 'it was good from the first match because i did not land on the court with much hope
 ' tippaniyan It is clear that Federer will be eyeing the Australian Open starting on 16 January
 federr ne 2012 ke baad se koi bhi grand slam toornament nahin jeeta he vahiin unhone 2010 main aakiri baar australian open kaa kitaab jeeta he
 Federer says "it would be good to win a Grand Slam after a long time but it is difficult to compete because there are many good players at the top but i will definitely try
" ' On his return, Federer said, "I wanted to play a little more in court, it was nice to come back

 ' 56 musafiron samet kul 66 logon ko lekar egypt airlines kaa ek paisanger plane buudhvaar raat paris se misr kii rajdhani kahiraa ke liye udaan bharta he
 Out of the four-hour flight, the journey of 3 hours 40 minutes is also completed
 manzil ab sirf 20 minute dur he
 But then suddenly the plane disappears into the air
 kya ye koi haadasa he? haijacking? plane main maujuud kisi aatmghaatee aatankwaadi kii harakat yaa phir jameen se aasmaan tak pahunchi koi or sajeesh?egypt airlines kaa paisanger plane airbas-320 duniya ke atyaadhunik airport se misr ke cairo shahar ke liye udaan bharta he
 The aircraft had a total of 66 passengers including 2 pilots and 5 crew members
 egypt airlines kaa vimaan emes 804 ab tak teen ghante or chalis minute kaa safar puraa kar chukaa tha
 During this time, he flies over the borders of many countries and over the Mediterranean Sea, enters Egypt's air border and thus passes for 3 hours and 40 minutes
 ab is plane ko misr kii sarajameen tak pahunchane main sirf 20 minute baaki hai
 But then something happens in the middle of the sky that suddenly this airbus breaks contact with the air traffic control of Egypt and in the next few seconds this airplane is lost in the air over the sea in the darkness of night
 achaanak radar se baahar hua planeakhir bich aasmaan main samandar ke upar ek plane achaanak kaise gaayab ho saktaa he? kahin ye koi aatankwaadi karrwai to nahin? agar haa, to kya is plane main koi bam tha yaa phir kisi ne ise neeche se hi maar giraaya? kahin hawaii jahaaj ko hai jaik kar haadase kaa shikaar to nahin banaaya gaya? aise namaaloom kitne hi sawaal is hawaii jahaaj ke hawa main gum hone ke saath hi khadey ho jate hai
 Cairo and then Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris are stirred up
 air trephic control main afratfari ke halaat paidaa ho jate hai
 People do not understand how this can happen
 ek plane jo bilkul sahi-salaamat ab se kuch seconds pehle hawa main ud rahaa tha, achaanak radar se baahar kaise ja saktaa he
 Now all the experts try to re-contact the plane somehow
 lekin sari koshishen bekaar chali jaati hai
 The mystery remains: It is appalled at the disappearance of this airplane at the airport of both the countries that a statement of French President François Olande comes out shortly
 raashtrapati jab is baat se mutmain ho jate hai ki ab laapata airbas ke sahi salaamat milane kii koi ummid nahin, to wo kehete hai ki is gumshudagi ko lekar kisi bhi theory ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Meaning is clear
 ye takneekee kharabi kii vajah se hue kisi haadase kaa nateeja bhi ho sakati he or kisi aatankwaadi karrwai kaa bhi
 But the mystery of this Airbus, lost in the air in the darkness of the night, remains constant and deepens with each passing moment
 sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki aakhir achaanak puraa kaa puraa plane kahaan gum ho gaya? jis jagah par aakhri baar hawaii jahaaj kaa sampark air trephirak control se tutaa tha vahaan par mausam bilkul saaf tha
 That is, there was no scope for an accident
 plane main tab tak koi takneekee kharabi bhi nahin ai thi
 Because the pilot gave no such message
 to phir kya hua?krash hone kaa lagaaya anumanmisr kii taraf se hawa main gaayab hue hawaii jahaaj ko dhundhane ke liye ek ke baad ek kai timen aasmaan or samandar ke raste ravaanaa kii jaati hai
 It also includes Egyptian Armed Forces, C-130 and Warning Air Craft
 
 On the other hand, many helicopters and other aircraft are also prepared for rescue operations
 maukey kii najaakat ko dekhte hue misr ke padosi mulk greece kii ore se bhi search oparation kii shuruyaat kii jaati he
 But there is no use

 There is speculation that the SP may field its candidates in 50 seats in Bihar
 
 
 
 So who will benefit? According to experts, this step of Samajwadi Party will benefit BJP and this is not happening for the first time
 pichhali baar ke bihar chunaavon main sapa ne 240 main se 146 par chunaav ladaa tha
 The SP had not won a single seat, but had scattered the anti-bjp vote

 iske peeche kai kaaran maane ja rahe hai
 Uttar Pradesh has assembly elections in 2017 and the law and order situation in the state is staggering
 aam janata main asantosh bad rahaa he
 If road highways are to be built in the state, then coordination with the center is needed

 There have been 180 riots in three years, but the most important is believed to be the case of CBI investigation on Yadav Singh
 yadav singh noida atharity ke pramukh rahaa he
 Akhilesh government also promoted it
 1995 main project ejeeniyar banaaya, baavjood iske ki vah ejeeniyar nahin tha
 But the Allahabad High Court has ordered a CBI inquiry against him
 gauratlab he ki yadav singh ne 6 mukhyamantriyon or teen alag-alag sarkaron ke tahat apni ahmiyat banaae rakhi he
 So will Mulayam Singh Yadav agree with a big heart
 
 
 
 The top post of the Grand Alliance will be liked by them
 
 
 yaa phir satta ke kareeb ve aana chaah rahe hai

 There is a discussion that Samajwadi Party was seeking 27 seats in Bihar, later the matter reached 17
 atakalein hai ki ab sapa bihar main 50 siton par apane ummidavaar utaar sakati he
 
 
 
 to iskaa phayda kisko hoga? jaankaron ke anusaar samaajawaadee party ke is kadam se bijepi ko phayda hoga or yah pehali baar nahin ho rahaa
 In the last Bihar elections, SP contested 146 out of 240
 sapa ne ek bhi seat nahin jiti thi, lekin usne bijepi virdohi vot ko bikher diya tha
 The effect was that the non-bjp parties had lost those seats
 samaajawaadee party ne yah ranneeti kuch or rajya chunaavon main bhi apanaai
 She contested in 22 in Maharashtra, 67 in Gujarat and 164 in Madhya Pradesh, where she won no seats
 haalanki bijepi ke ummidavaaron ko jeet mili mushkil se
 The comments ab sawaal uth rahaa he ki mulaayam singh yadav bijepi ke kareeb kyon aa rahe hai
 There are many reasons behind this
 2017 main uttarapradesh main vidhansabha chunaav he or rajya main kanoon vyavastha kii haalat dagamagaa rahi he
 There is growing discontent among the general public

 lekin elahabaad hai court ne uske khilaaf sibiai jaanch ke aadesh de die hai

 to kya mulaayam singh yadav bada dil dikhaakar maan jaaenge
 
 
 
 mahagathbandhan kaa sheersh pad unhen bhayega
 
 
 Or they want to come closer to power
 vah 2017 or 2019 ke chunaavon ke jariye kend main apane liye jagah talash rahe hai
 This will be clear in the coming days, but before the Bihar elections, Nitish Kumar has suffered a big blow today
 garmaate ja rahe hai bihar chunaav
 However, last week, Mulayam Singh Yadav met Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aaj ramgopal yadav ne amit shah se mulaakaat se bhari sabha main inkaar kiya
 But experts say that this meeting took place
 charchaa he ki bihar main samaajawaadee party 27 siten maang rahi thi, baad main baat 17 par panhuch gai thi
 There is speculation that the SP may field its candidates in 50 seats in Bihar
 
 
 
 So who will benefit? According to experts, this step of Samajwadi Party will benefit BJP and this is not happening for the first time
 pichhali baar ke bihar chunaavon main sapa ne 240 main se 146 par chunaav ladaa tha
 The SP had not won a single seat, but had scattered the anti-bjp vote
 iskaa asar yah hua tha ki naan bijepi partiyaan vah siten haar gai thim
 The Samajwadi Party adopted this strategy in some other state elections as well
 maharashtra main 22, gujarat main 67 or madhyapradesh main 164 main vah chunaav ladi, jahaan usne koi seat nahin jiti
 However, the BJP candidates have barely won
 tippaniyan Now the question arises why Mulayam Singh Yadav is getting close to BJP
 iske peeche kai kaaran maane ja rahe hai
 Uttar Pradesh has assembly elections in 2017 and the law and order situation in the state is staggering
 aam janata main asantosh bad rahaa he
 If road highways are to be built in the state, then coordination with the center is needed
 akhilesh sarkaar ke rajyapal ram nik se tanatani bani hui he
 There have been 180 riots in three years, but the most important is believed to be the case of CBI investigation on Yadav Singh
 yadav singh noida atharity ke pramukh rahaa he
 Akhilesh government also promoted it
 1995 main project ejeeniyar banaaya, baavjood iske ki vah ejeeniyar nahin tha
 But the Allahabad High Court has ordered a CBI inquiry against him
 gauratlab he ki yadav singh ne 6 mukhyamantriyon or teen alag-alag sarkaron ke tahat apni ahmiyat banaae rakhi he
 So will Mulayam Singh Yadav agree with a big heart
 
 
 
 The top post of the Grand Alliance will be liked by them
 
 
 yaa phir satta ke kareeb ve aana chaah rahe hai
 He is looking for a place in the center through the 2017 and 2019 elections

 There are many reasons behind this
 2017 main uttarapradesh main vidhansabha chunaav he or rajya main kanoon vyavastha kii haalat dagamagaa rahi he
 There is growing discontent among the general public

 Ram and Lakshmana (ie Mukesh Ambani 54, and Anil Ambani 52) have begun to bridge the family rift that was unchallenged, and with that Mumbai's Dalal Street is getting ready for good news
 bharat ke aadhunik vyavsaay shalaka purush dhirubhai ambani ke khadey kiye gaye samrajya ko vaarison main hue vibhaajan or aapasi jhgade ne khaasaa nuksaan pahunchaaya or shairdharakon kii sampatti ko nasht kiya
 What the stock market and his mother Kokilaben knew — unity is better than division — was apparently not persuaded by the Ambani brothers
 lekin ab, 2008 kii shuruyaat main aae reliance power ke ipio ke baad se padaa barason kaa sookhaa or kanoonon or paise kii baari-bharkam ladaai agar kuch dinon main nahin, to kuch hafton ke andar apane ant kii ore badhati najar aa rahi he
 There is a discussion of cooperation that is going to happen in the bases of secret discussions
 badhati pratiyogita, stock mulyon main giravat or satta ke galiyaaron main jane-maane ambani dabadabe ke abhaav se pareshaan donon bhai ab ek gupt samajhaite kii koshish kar rahe hai, taaki bazaar main jaan foonkane ke liye ek shashakt sandesh bheja ja sake
 For the last few months, speculations were being made that there is talk of uniting and merging the resources among the world's most wealthy brothers who are in a quarrel that can benefit both
 isse asia ke sabase bade paariwarikavivaadon main se ek kaa ant ho saktaa he
 When the bifurcation took place between these two brothers, it was actually Rs 52,096 crore
 ke anil kaa bazaar puunjikaran bade bhai mukesh ke 51,629 karod ru
 Was more than june 2005 or uske baad may 2010 kii tarah, is baar bhi is sethu kii nirmaataa kulmaata kokilaben ambani hai, jinhone apane beton ko spasht shabdon main kah diya he ki ab milakar chalane kaa samay aa gaya he
 In May 2010 too, Kokilaben called for 'ending all hostility'
 us samay donon bhai ek duusare se pratiyogita na karne kaa samajhaita radd karne par sahamat hue the, jo ki 2005 main hue samajhaite kaa hissaa tha
 They were then free to enter each other's business
 ab, mumbai ke kolaba kshetra main unke paariwarik nivas, si wind, kii charadivari ke bheetar, kokilaben unhen apane sambandhon ko agle str par le jane ke liye kah rahi hai, jisamen donon apni swatantra korporate companiyon ko barkaraar rakh sakenge, lekin unhen ek-duusare ke saath sahyog karnaa anivaary hoga
 The first sign of some positive movement was found in November 2010, when Anil's Reliance ADAG (revenue Rs 46,000 crore)
 ) ne master brands se anil kaa naam nikaalkar iskaa nayaa naam reliance group rakh diya tha
 This opened the doors to possible cooperation
 donon samoohon ke kshatrap ek-duusare ke khilaaf galat or vikrut baaten failaane se dhire-dhire baj aane lage
 When the preparations for this collaboration start celebrating, the first step will be Mukesh's Reliance Industries Ltd
 (ariel, rajasav 2,62,000 karod ru
 ) And Anil's deal with Reliance Communications (r-com), in which r-com's telecom tower structure will be leased to RIL for its upcoming broadband and wireless Internet services
 deshvyapee nilaamee main himachal fucharistic communications li
 After buying Infotel, the only company to acquire fourth generation spectrum from RIL, RIL needs this structure to grow its internet business
 is saude kii ruparekha kya he? india today ko pataa chalaa he ki karmchaariyon ke vetan aadi kharchon kaa bhugtan karke aar-com ke niskriy pade dhaanche ko kiraye par apane adhikaar main lene ke liye ariel hastakshar karne kii prakriya main he
 At the same time r-com to its tower branch, presumably 4
 5 se 4
 Taking the company's equity for $ 8 billion, the Blackstone Group, together with Carlyle India and American Tower, will transform into a new company
 puri sambhaavna yah he ki anil ambani company main 26 fisadi ke aasapaas hissedari rakhenge
 Out of this total money, Anil got Rs 33,000 crore
 ke apane baari-bharkam karj kaa mul dhan kam karne main madad milegi
 r-com had failed to sell its Infotel Tower unit in the past when GTL Infrastructure pulled back in September over a deal to buy r-com's 50,000 towers for $ 9 billion
 tower bechney ke baad aar-com ek vishuddh wireles company rah jaaegi
 In the second phase, there is every possibility that the same investment game will be played with r-com's marine cable companies - Flag and Falcon
 agar sahi daam lagaae jaaen, to samudr ke neeche ke vyavsaay ko bhi bechaa ja saktaa he, or isse bhi karj khatm karne main madad milegi
 Ambani brothers can join hands in the insurance business too
 pichley hafte tak mukesh ambani kii ariel kii sunil mittal kii bharti enterprijej ke saath bharti-eksa main sunil mittal kii hissedari kharidne ko lekar baatcheet chal rahi thi
 bharti-axa is a joint venture with French insurance company AXA in the ratio of 76-24
 agar aisa hota to isse mukesh ambani beemaa ke pratiyogi bazaar main anil ambani kii reliance life insurance or reliance general insurance ke khilaaf utar jate
 In the last week of November, after a six-month run, RIL and Bharti's talks suddenly broke off
 us samay tak vyapak taur par yah mana ja rahaa tha ki ariel kaa bharti kii hissedari kharidne kaa sauda lagbhag tay he
 With RIL having a change of heart, it was immediately speculated that Mukesh D
 i
 Together with Shaw, they are trying separately in the financial services sector, but they came out of the insurance sector because Anil is already present in this particular area
 29 or 30 november ko rajdhani main satta ke galiyaaron main mukesh kii chahalkadami ke fouran baad, jisamen ve pradhanmantri or har mahatvapurn vyakti se mili the, anil ne bhi thik yahi kaam kiya
 Both brothers met Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and took his blessings
 donon bhaaiyon ko niamakon-sieji or yahaan tak ki jaanch agenciyon tak se pareshaani hone lagi thi, isse unke share mulyon par asar padaa tha

 Although it is said that the two brothers talk very little among themselves, there have been many occasions when both families have come together
 24 may, 2010 ke shanti samajhaite ke baad, andhra pradesh ke thirumala main anil ne us guest house main vishram kiya tha, jiskaa swaamitv mukesh kii ariel kaa he, jisase ek anaupchaarik samajhaite kii shuruyaat kaa sanket mila tha
 This was followed by a reunion of the two families in the wilds of the 2010 World Cup of Football in the jungles of South Africa's Kruger National Park, which lasted for three days

 Kamath played a key role in the mediation between the two brothers before the much-publicized partition in 2005
 kokilaben ne 2005 main kamath or invesetment banker nimesh compani ko apni madad ke liye bulaayaa tha
 The talks, among other things, are believed to have revolved around the current market capital of both groups

 It was he who brokered the partition in 2005, when it was clear that the two brothers would not be able to run a continuously growing business together

 The question is, where did the thousands of Jharkhandis who first arrived there go? How and when did they disappear from the newly formed Bhojpuri world of Girmitiya porters? Why did it happen that the Girmitiya porter himself got independence, but his freedom went quietly to the hill porters

 He said that he would try his best not to get the government involved in inter-ministerial petitions

 antarrashtriyamudra bazarmendollarake mukaable rupee kii giravat lagaataar jari he
 The rupee crossed the 72 level against the dollar on Thursday morning
 jaankaron kaa daawa he ki rupee main yah giravat vaishvik kaarnon se dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Why the falling rupee? The ongoing trade war between the US and China and the increasing confidence of the people globally on the dollar are being cited as the biggest reasons for this decline of the rupee
 vaishvik str par is trade war ke chalate lagaataar dollar main duniya kaa bharosa bad rahaa he or dollar kii jamkar kharidari kaa ja rahi he
 At the same time, currencies of emerging markets have suffered worldwide
 jaankaron kaa yah bhi kahana he ki turki kii mudra lira main jari giravat jahaan samooche europe kii mudraon ke liye sankat bani he, vahiin europe kii mudraon main giravat se ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon ke saamne sankat chaaya hua he
 In addition, the continued rise in global crude oil prices is also posing a serious challenge to the currencies of these economies
 aam aadmi ko kya nuksaan?rupee kii vaishvik bazaar main keemat kaa sidhaa asar aam aadmi par padataa he
 In simple words, if this effect is said, then everything in the market starts getting expensive
 rupee kii keemat main giravat aam aadmi ke liye videsh main chhuttiyaan manaane, videshi car kharidne, smartphone kharidne or videsh main padhai karne ko mahangaa kar detaa he
 Due to this, inflation starts knocking in the country
 rosemara kii jarurat ke utpaada mahange hone lagate hai
 You can say that the constant weakening of the rupee against the dollar makes bread, cloth and house expensive for the common man
 ise padhein: in 5 sawaalon ke jawaab se pataa chalegaa notebandi paas hui yaa fail?vahiin rupee ke kamjor hone ke asar se aam aadmi ke liye home lone bhi mahangaa ho jaataa he
 So, it is clear that when the rupee continues to fall against the dollar, this is not the time to take a new home loan
 iske alaava kamjor rupee ke chalate desh kaa aayaat mahangaa ho jaataa he
 At a time when crude oil prices are already at peak levels, a weak rupee puts more burden on the state exchequer and the government's current account deficit widens
 arabiai ke paas vikalp nahin?aam dharna he ki rupee kii chapai ke saath-saath vaishvik mudra bazaar main rupee ko trade karaane menriserv bainkki ahm bhoomika he
 Considering the current depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, India Today Hindi editor Anshuman Tiwari says that the Reserve Bank has no option left to handle the rupee move
 anshuman ne kaha ki maujuuda sthiti isliye bhi penchida he kyonki ab rigerv bank rupee ko bachaane ke liye kuch kadam uthaata bhi he to vah kaamyaab nahin hoga kyonki rupaya puri tarah se vaishvik sthiti kaa mohataaj he, jinpar hamaara yani arabiai yaa sarkaar kaa koi niyantran nahin he
 Read this: These 10 advantages were expected from demonetisation, these 5 losses are confirmed, some traders of the money market also confirm this
 media reports kii maane to buudhvaar ko rupee ke 71
 After falling to the level of 95 per dollar, the Central Reserve Bank took around 1 to handle the rupee
 5-2 arab dollar apane videshi mudra bhandar se kharch kiye
 But even this step did not work on Thursday morning
 guuruuvaar subah dollar ke mukaable thodi majbootee ke saath khulne ke baad ek baar phir rupaya 72 ke manovaigyanik str se neeche chalaa gaya or kendriya bank kii kavayad dhari kii dhari rah gai
 Who is responsible for the beating of the rupee? a country's currency explains the health of its economy
 aarthik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki mudra ko sanchalit karne kii sabase badi jimmedaari us desh kii sarkaar kii hoti he
 Rajiv Dubey, editor of Business Today, on the continuing decline in the Indian rupee, says that to save the rupee from such a situation, the central government will have to increase exports in the country as well as increase FDI and FPI
 doobe ke mutabik yah kaam maujuuda sthiti main nahin balki ek lambii avadhi ke dauraan kiya jaataa he
 If there was no economic slowdown in the country, the rupee would not have been trapped in this situation against the dollar
 lihaaja, maujuuda sthiti se rupee ko nikaalane ke liye export main bada ijaphe ke saath-saath desh main bada videshi pratyaksh nivesh (epadiai) or videshi portpholio nivesh kii jarurat he
 Rajiv believes that if the government had done better work on these three front during the last few years, the rupee would not have reached the present position
 car par lagi kharonch uske maalik ko khushi nahin detii he, lekin mahaan ballebaaj sachin tendulkar ne apni car par lagi kharonchon ko ‘ khushnuma kharonch ’kaha he

 ’unhone kaha, ‘kisi tarah vah stadium tak pahunch gayi or jab vah yahaan aa rahi thim to stadium ke baahar log naach rahe the, jashn manaa rahe the or kaaron ke upar kud rahe the
 The celebration however stalled for a while when fans recognized Anjali
 'unhone kaha, ‘kisi tarah vah stadium ke andar ain or iske baad ham sabhi ne dressing room main jashn manaaya
 When it came time to go back to the hotel, i saw the car and was surprised that there were many scratches on the roof of the car

 Narendra Modi does not forget to remember Atal Bihari Vajpayee on every major occasion and in his statements since taking office as Prime Minister
 darasal, donon netaaon kaa purana gaharaa naata bhi rahaa he
 It was Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose decision Narendra Modi has succeeded in paving the way to the pinnacle of power today
 atal ne narendra modi ko banaaya tha gujarat kaa siemgujrat main 1995 ke chunaav main bijepi ne purna bahumat kii sarkaar banaai
 Keshubhai Patel was made the chief minister, bypassing Shankar Singh Vaghela and Narendra Modi
 iske baad narendra modi ko party kaa kaamkaaj dekhne ke liye dilli bula liya gaya
 In 1998, mid-term elections were held in Gujarat and once again BJP returned to power
 lekin kendriya netritv ne modi ko abhi bhi dilli main hi jode rakhaa or keshubhai patel ko phir se siem kii jimmedaari di gai

 During this time, voices of protest against Keshubhai Patel began to rise in the state unit of the party

 As a result, Keshubhai resigned citing health

 jiske baad 2002, 2007 or 2012 main bhi vah gujarat ke siem bane or 2014 main desh ke pradhanmantri kii kursi sanbhaalane kaa mauka mila

 If we are forgetting this today then there are many reasons for this
 ek ore sangh parivaar samarthit bijepi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar sattarudh he to 'ek hindu rashtravaadi’ sarvocch pad par asin he
 Perhaps this is why signs of Hindutvaism have started to appear

 India has achieved great achievement in the world of space
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne buudhvaar dopaher kareeb saadhe baarah baje desh ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki bharat ne kuch hi der pehle antariksh main ek satellite ko maar giraaya he
 India has become the fourth country in the world to do so
 antariksh main hone vaala ye mishan pokharan main kiye gaye parmaanu pareekshan jaisaa hi tha
 After this test, India has once again got its iron in the world
 ye mishan kyon khaas?vaigyanikon kii maane to bharat kaa ye safal oparation bahut mahatvapurn he
 Talking to Aaj Tak, scientist RP Tandon told that now India can keep an eye on the movements of the enemy in water, sky and land as well as in space
 yani agar koi dushman desh antariksh main satellite ke jariye bharat par nazar rakh rahaa he yaa phir jasusi kar rahaa he to bharat uski hi missile ko nasht kar saktaa he
 This mission is completely Make in India, ie this mission has been completed with the help of ISRO and DRDO
 jab pokharan pareekshan se hill gai thi duniya
 
 
 In this sense, India's achievement is as big as the nuclear test led by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 tab bhi duniya ke kisi desh ko khabar nahin thi ki bharat itani badi taiyaari kar rahaa he yaa phir kar bhi diya he
 And this is exactly what has happened even today
 11 may 1998 ko rajasthan ke pokharan main 3 parmaanu bamon kaa safal pareekshan kiya gaya tha, isi ke saath hi bharat newclear nesan ban gaya tha
 The work of nuclear test was done behind the scenes, so that no one could get the news
 yahaan tak ki america ke khufia satellites ko bhi isaki bhanak nahin thi
 After 'operation Shakti', 'mission Shakti', then Prime Minister Vajpayee gave this information in a similar press conference, which shocked the world
 tab duniya ke kai deshon ne bharat par pratibandh lagaae the
 However, despite this the Government of India did not back down
 khaas baat ye he ki us mishan kaa naam ‘oparation shakti’ hi tha
 Those who played a key role in that mission included the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Defense Minister George Fernandes, and APJ Abdul Kalam, Consultant Scientist in the Ministry of Defense
 donon oparation main kya he samanta?- is oparation kaa naam ‘mishan shakti’ he, jabaki pokharan main hue parmaanu pareekshan ke mishan kaa naam ‘oparation shakti’ tha
 Even then the mission was done completely silently and was announced by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 aaj bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne khud desh ko sambodhit karte hue isaki ghoshnaa kii
 - India emerged as a nuclear power in the era of Indira Gandhi, but after that no government had tested nuclear again
 lekin tatkaaleen piem atal bihari vaajapeyi ne duniya ke virodh ko peeche chhod raajnneetik ichha shakti jataai or faisla kiya
 The same has happened in the mission power in space, India was able to complete it only in 2012, but since then no decision was made yet, but now the mission has been completed

 In fact, Rahul Gandhi, while making false claims in an election rally, had quoted the Supreme Court saying that the top court has also said that the watchman is a thief
 jabaki supreme court ne apane faisle main aisa kuch nahin kaha tha
 The Supreme Court has given him notice on the contempt petition filed against Rahul Gandhi

 baharhaal, somvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan yachikakarta prashanth bhushan ne bench ko bataaya ki vah rivyuu yachika ke paksh main bahes karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 He also asked that his co-petitioner Arun Shourie be allowed to present his arguments for a separate application seeking punishment for unknown public servants who allegedly misled the court during the previous hearing of the Rafale case did
