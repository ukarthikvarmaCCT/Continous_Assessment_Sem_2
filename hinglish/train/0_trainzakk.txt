 com / q8aluk3chd a 10-year-old girl died of snake bite on 20 November at a local school in Wayanad, Kerala
 jaankaree ke anusaar chaatra paanchavin kaksha main padhati thi
 The incident happened while student s Sherin was sitting in her class
 saanp class ke floor par ek hole se andar aa gaya or usne chaatra ko kaat liya tha
 s Sherin's classmate said that, immediately after the incident, he had informed the teacher but he said that it may have happened due to stone or something on the foot
 class kii ek anya chaatra ne media ko bataaya, "hamane shikshak ko ghatana ke vakt hi bataaya tha ki es sharin ko saanp ne kaata he or use doctor ke paas le janaa chahie
 About 1 hour after the incident, S
 Sherin's leg turned blue and then his father arrived at the school and admitted him to a nearby hospital
 '' class kii ek or chaatra ne bataaya ki vah khud bhi teacher se baar-baar kah rahi thi ki use saanp ne kaat liya he
 Let me tell you, a teacher has been suspended in this case
 vahiin maamle main lagaae gaye aaropon ko lekar jaanch kaa aadesh diya gaya he or aaropon ke sach sabit hone par kerala ke shiksha mantri professor si
 Rabindranath has directed strict action in the case
 pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ne jis tareeke se kashmir ghati main aatankiyon kaa chun-chunakar safaya kiya he, usase pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaa or unki sarparast pakistani khufia agency iesai baukhala gai he
 Terrorist gangsters who have failed to push the youth of Kashmir valley in the path of terror, are now engaged in brainwashing and tricking those Kashmiris who are going to a country like Turkey and studying on education scholarship
 khufia sutron ke mutabik pakistan ne turki main kashmiri yuvaaon ke liye sibar cell kholaa he
 Through this, the ISI is trying to trick the educated youth of Kashmir and incite them against India
 sutron ke mutabik iske liye pakistan ne ek group ko funding karke sibar cell kholane ke liye kaha he
 In fact, every year scholarships are given to the youth who reach Turkey to study from all over the world
 yah scolership turki detaa he
 Kashmiri youth also get scholarship through this program
 pichley saal puure vishwa se turki main scolership ke liye ek lakh 35 hajaar chaatro ne aavedan kiya tha, jinamein se 17 hajaar 500 yuvakon ko safalataa hasil hui thi
 This scholarship started in the year 1992
 suraksha maamalon ke jaankaron ke mutabik kashmiri chaatro ko turki main isliye nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he, kyonki kashmir main aatanki lagaataar oparation ol out main maare ja rahe he
 isi's pulses are not melting in Kashmir
 aise main pakistan apane mitra desh turki main kashmir se scolership par gaye yuvaaon ko rijhaa rahaa he
 Experts say that security forces and intelligence agencies will have to keep a close watch on this, so that the country's enemies do not succeed
 aapako bataa den ki is saal suraksha balon ne kashmir main alag-alag oparation main ab tak 72 aatankiyon ko dher kar diya he, jinamein jaish ke sabase zyada aatanki shaamil hai
 According to sources, due to the death of such number of terrorists and the reduction in recruitment of terror, now only 45 Pakistani terrorists and 55 local terrorists are left in the valley
 pichley saal is mausam main aatankiyon kii sankhya kareeb 300 ke aasapaas thi
 Let me tell you that recently the Pakistani terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed attacked a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Kashmir, in which more than 40 soldiers were martyred
 iske baad bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke balakot main ghuskar sargical strike kii thi
 Pakistan was not even aware of this surgical strike of India
 iske baad pakistan ne bhartiya kshetra main hawaii hamalaa karne kii koshish kii thi, jiskaa bhartiya vayusena ne munhtod jawaab diya tha
 During this time there was an air collision, in which the Indian Air Force killed the Pakistani F-16 fighter aircraft
 pradhanmantri kii is baat main dam he ki mazaduron ko wo sammaan nahin miltaa to kot pant waalon ko mil jaataa he
 At least he said that workers do not get respect
 lekin jo unhone mazaduron ke kalyaan ke naam par yojanaayen launch kii hai usamen un jagahon kii chintaa nazar nahin aati jahaan pradhanmantri kii nazar main sammaan paane vaala mazdoor rahata he
 Move to the border areas of Delhi Haryana
 bihar, uttar pradesh, andhra pradesh or urisa, madhyapradesh se aae garib mazaduron ko kin paristhitiyon main rahanaa padataa he aap dekh kar yakeen nahin kar sakenge
 The small rooms remain like the Andaman and Nicobar Cellular Jail
 ek kamare ke upar kamare taash ke patton kii tarah bana kar tikaa die gaye hai
 These are not rooms
 gupha hai
 There is only one way to go
 bahut kam kamaron main khidkiya hai
 Whenever you want to enter these houses, you will not see any concern about security
 sau sau mazdoor jin makaanon main rahete hai vahaan sidhiyon par railing tak nahin he
 The darkness in the corridors is dark
 khaanaa banane kii jagah par utani hi gandi he jitani kachra phenkane kii jagah gandi hoti he
 Would you like to eat here in kamaron main rahane vaala mazdoor alag tarah kii asuraksha kaa saamana karata he
 The wind does not come
 kamare main khaanaa bananaa or nahaana
 Obviously pollution will also happen
 isse unke swasthya par bhi asar padataa hoga
 Their productivity will also be low
 jahaan bhi mazdoor rahete hai vahaan chale jaaiye
 Gurgaon, Faridabad, Delhi's villages bordering it
 mazaduron ko naarkeey sthiti main rahanaa padataa he
 Citizens can at least clean the garbage here
 prashasan kam se kam safai kii vyavastha kar saktaa he
 Can arrange toilet
 har ghar main shauchalay banane kaa daawa ho rahaa he
 There are four toilets in a hundred sleeping rooms here
 wo bhi bahut kharaab
 there is no water
 bukamp aa gaya to ye makaan kitni der tikenge koi nahin jaanata
 Seeing them makes one feel apprehensive
 ham jo bhi dikhaa rahe hai wo koi nai baat nahin he
 All these houses will be ten to fifteen years old
 hamaari koshish he ki kisi tarah se inaki samasyaayein aapaki nazar main aaen
 If this matter comes in your priority, then the government will also be ready to clean up and restore fair order here
 iske liye pradhanmantri hi bolen zaruri nahin he
 The administration will not know about these places, it cannot happen
 sawaal ye he ki hota kuch kyon nahin he
 The worker living in these rooms faces different kinds of insecurity
 hawa nahin aati he
 Cooking and bathing in the room
 zaahir he pradooshan bhi hota hoga
 This would also affect their health
 unki utpaadakta bhi kam hoti hogi
 Go wherever the workers live
 gudgaanv, faridabad, inaki simaaon se lage dilli ke gaanv
 Workers have to stay in hellish condition
 nagarpalikaayen kam se kam yahaan kachra saaf kar sakati hai
 The administration can at least arrange for cleanliness
 shauchalay kaa intazaam kar saktaa he
 There is a claim to build toilets in every house
 yahaan to sau so kamare par chaar shauchalay hai
 That too very bad
 pani nahin he
 No one knows how long these houses will last if an earthquake strikes
 inhen dekhakar hi kisi ashanka kaa ahsaas hota he
 What we are showing is nothing new
 ye saare makaan das pandrah saal puraane to honge hi
 We try to somehow get their problems in your eyes
 aapaki praathamikta main ye baat aegi to sarkaar bhi tatpar hogi yahaan saaf safai or nyaaypurna vyavastha behaal karne main
 It is not necessary to speak for the Prime Minister
 prashasan ko in jagahon ke bare main pataa nahin hoga aisa to ho nahin saktaa
 The question is why nothing happens
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main saamaajik kaaryakarta ne kaha ki kiran bedi or arvind kejariwal jaise logon ko apane andolan se jodna unke jivan kii bhul thi
 He said that taking a lesson from the past, this time he has filled the bonds on stamp paper of 100 rupees from the people joining him against corruption that he will not join any political party
 unhone kaha ki iskaa ulanghan karne waalon ke khilaaf vah maamla darj karaayenge

25 billion, which has a large number of youth below 25 years, it is a very difficult challenge to achieve
 aarthik vikaas ke liye badi aabaadi desh ke liye vardaan sabit ho sakati he par ucch shiksha ke maamle main yah abhishaap ban gai he, khaskar gunvattta ke sandarbh main
 The number of reputed institutions in the country is very less, in which only a few thousand people get good education
 ise dekhte hue kadi pratiyogita ke daur main mata-pita apane bacchon ko daakhile kii taiyaari main jhonk dete hai
 Coaching centers benefit from this situation
 lihaaja, pichley kuch varshon main unki sankhya teji se badi he
 Many of these coaching institutes have already mastered guessing the questions that can be asked in the exam
 koching sansthaanon kii sankhya teji se badaae kii sabase badi vajah yah he ki hamaare desh main schuli shiksha kii acchhee suvidhaayen nahin hai, adhyapakon main paryaapt patibaddhta nahin he or saath hi achche adhyapakon kaa abhaav bhi he
 So now from class 6, many children have started taking coaching
 iske alaava koching udyog main shuruaati nivesh bhi bahut kam he
 Some rooms and teachers are required for this

 aadi kai nami koching centre apni dhak jamaa chuke hai
 Students from all over the country come for coaching there
 inamen se zyaadaatar koching centre kota main hai
 According to an estimate, around 2 lakh students are staying for coaching in Kota
 kuch udhyamiyon ne start-ap ke taur par bhi koching centre khol liye hai
 Business is an opportunity in a free economy and coaching business is definitely a good opportunity
 koching centre agar fal-phool rahe hai to isaki mukhya vajah yahi he ki hamaare skool apane bacchon ko paryaapt rup se shiksha nahin de paa rahe hai
 Some politicians and academics criticize the business of coaching, but in reality do not make any effort to stop it
 centre sarkaar ne pichley ek dashak main kuch prayaas kiye hai
 One such effort was made in 2013, when it was decided to use the marks of 12th standard (or its equivalent) to prepare for the merit list
 lekin pratiyogi parikshaon ke saath kwalifing pariksha ke pradarshan kaa istemaal zyada safal nahin rahaa
 No agency in the world had thought of consolidating the marks of students of about 50 different boards in the country
 emecharadi, sibiesai, vibhinn shiksha bordon, bade sansthaanon or samitiyon ke jariye ise shakl di gai thi or 2013 se 2015 ke teen shaikshik satron main ise safaltaapurvak chalaaya bhi gaya
 Unfortunately, this ambitious effort has ended in 2016
 isaki vajah shaayad prabandhan kii samasyaayein (khaskar samay kaa niyantran, paper kaa punarmoolyankan or kanoonee dakhsandajiyaan) hai
 The coaching system puts tremendous pressure on children to perform better
 atyadhik dabaav ke kaaran kuch bachche aatmahatya karne ko majaboor ho jate hai
 To tackle this, a massive effort is needed
 hamen bacchon kii janmajaat pratibha ko shuru se hi nikhaarana hoga or usamen unki swaabhaavik ruchi kii pahchaan kerani hogi taaki aage chalakar ve apane kariyar kii disha main sahi kadam uthaa saken
 We should not just push our children towards careers like engineering, medical or chartered accountancy
 aajkal achche kariyar ke kai duusare vikalp bhi hai, jaise kanoon, hotel management, fine atrs, patrakarita, or finance vagairah
 These days many branches have also developed in traditional fields like engineering, such as food, fashion and leather technology etc
 apni ruchi ke anukool kariyar kaa chunaav karke koching ke jaal main funsane se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Gradual generations will move away from the traditional options and start choosing new ones
 samuchit jaankaree, har tarah ke kaam ko saamaajik pratishtha, aasaan karj ke jariye vittiya madad or aadhunik takneekee ke kaaran chaatr bhavishya mank apni ruchi kaa kariyar apana sakenge or sirf degree yaa naukari ke peeche aankh mundakar nahin bhaagenge

 Because the experience of running the racket of smuggling was with Abu Bakr
 police kii jaanch main yah bhi saamne aayaa tha ki raigarh ke raste abu bakar ne mumbai main ardex pahunchaaya tha
 Such was the name of Abu Bakr
 
 
 1993 blast ke pehle hi abu bakar bharat chhod kar chalaa gaya tha

 dilli metro main safar kar rahe musafiron kii jaan us vakt halak main atak gai, jab platform se metro darwaja khule hue hi chal di
 The metro gained momentum within the tunnel, but the door of the metro remained open
 ghatana somvaar raat kareeb das baje kii he or metro kii yelo line yani gudgaanv badali line kii he
 The whole incident was captured by one of the passengers Ali Abbas in his mobile
 yahi nahin unhone apni phikr jataane ke saath hi is yatra ke dauraan duusare yatriyon ke dar or anubhav ko bhi apane mobile camere main kaid kar liya
 According to the incident, the metro train was coming from Gurgaon and going towards the university
 chaavdi bazaar metro stesan tak to sabakuch thik rahaa, lekin chaavdi bazaar se jaise hi metro aage badi, coach kaa ek darwaja band hi nahin hua
 Although the doors of the metro are equipped with sensors and the metro does not move until the door is closed, but there was some technical fault that despite the door being opened, the metro gained momentum and moved towards Chandni Chowk
 tunnel ke bheetar pahunchane par metro ne or raftaar pakadi
 This was intimidating for the passengers of the metro because till now the metro is confident that the metro will move only after the door is closed
 lekin agle stesan yani chandani chowk pahunchane tak metro ke musafiron kii saansen ataki hi raheen
 Metro staff also rode from Chandni Chowk, but the door was not closed
 yahaan tak ki kashmiri get tak bhi darwaja khulaa hi rahaa
 However, DMRC says that due to technical fault, the doors of the Metro were left open and at the very next station, the staff of the Metro guarded the door as a precaution, so that no accident occurs
 iske baad kashmiri get par darwaja band kar diya gaya
 Not only this, the metro train was also evacuated at the university itself
 lekin, is video or ghatana ne metro kii badi laaparvaahee ujagar kar di, kyonki metro main aksar bahut bheed hoti he, aise main agar khule daravaajon ke saath metro ne raftaar pakad lee to koi bhi bada haadasa ho saktaa tha
 According to Ali Abbas Naqvi, the creator of the video, this experience was very scary for him, because such meticulous negligence could be fatal if the metro is considered a safe means of travel

 So there is no question of my going to Maharashtra

 On another question of the role of government formation in Maharashtra, Nitin Gadkari said from where to get work order if not received

 champions trophy main aaj team india ke liye sabase bada match he jab wo ovel ke maidan par dakshin africa ke saath do-do haath karne utregi
 If former champions Team India loses in this match, then their dream of reaching the semi-finals will be broken
 champions trophy ke ab tak ke maichon main jis tarah barish villen banakar ubhari he use dekhte hue cricket premi pich report yaa team combination kii bajaay mausam ke purvanumaan main zyada dilchaspee dikhaa rahe hai
 However the good news for cricket lovers is that it is less likely to rain during the match at the Oval
 match sthaneey samyaanusaar saadhe 10 baje shuru hoga or is dauraan badalon or suraj ke bich aankh michauli chalati rahegi
 There is also a possibility of cloudy sky in the middle but no rain has been predicted
 match se pehle subah chah baje jarur barish hui thi lekin baaki puure din aaj match main barish ke chalate kisi prakaar kii baadha utpann hone kii sambhaavna nahin jataai gai he
 Significantly, in the Champion's Trophy rain has disrupted the matches a lot
 ye barish kaa hi asar he ki e group main vishwa cap kii donon finlist newjiland or england bina koi match jite baahar ho chuki hai jabaki bangladesh jaisi kamjor team antim chaar main jagah banane main kaamyaab rahi he
 Talking about b group, right now all four teams are on par with two points and any two of them can make it to the last four
 video game bacchon ke bich aaj behad lokapriy hai lekin visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki video game kharidte samay mata pita ko usamen die gaye game or umr kii seemaa ko dhyaan main jarur rakhana chahie
 Experts also say that violent video games can be avoided in the ill effects of children's mind and brain, provided parents explain to children that video games are not a reality but a fantasy and are only a means of entertainment
 is
 dilli ke kanat place sthit palika bazaar main video game dukaan ke maalik rajnish ne bataaya ki mata pita ko games kii jaankaree nahin hoti isliye ve keval bacchon kii pasand par nirbhar rahete hai lekin aisa nahin hona chahie
 He says that parents should keep in mind what their content is and what age group they are for children while purchasing video games
 sar gangaaraam aspataal ke bal manorog chikitsak deepak gupta ne bataaya ki mata pita ko yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki jab bhi bachche televijan dekhen yaa video game khelen to ghar kaa koi bada sadsy unke saath rahe kyonki bacchon ko video game kii vishay vastu kii asaliyat se waakif karaayaa janaa behad jaruri he anyathaa bachche ek abhaasi duniya main vichrana shuru kar dete hai
 It can be understood in this way that after playing a video game of Spiderman, a child questioned his mother in a very naïve manner when she would bite the spider so that she could also become a Spidman
 rajnish ne saath hi bataaya ki mata pita ko video game kharidne se pehle sambandhit game kii reating kaa pataa lagaana chahie ki vah kis shrenee kaa he kyonki aajkal aise video game bazaar main uplabdh hai jinamein baari hinsa ke saath hi sex bhi bharpoor he
 Therefore, keeping in mind the age of the child, one must also consider the rating
 da
 Gupta says that this is a proof that children are overly innocent and everything that comes in front of them is a truth
 lekin vah saath hi kehete hai ki hinsak video game se jaruri nahin ki bacchon main hinsak pravriti paidaa ho 
 Dr
 deepak gupta kii hi baat kaa samarthan karmama lamas thinle dorji kii baton main najar aata he
 Tibetan Buddhism teacher Trinley Dorji said in an interview to an English daily some time ago that he too plays violent video games
 unhone kaha tha, ‘‘yadi mere bheetar yaa man main kahin koi nakaaratmak bhaavana he to video game ek aisa maarg he jisamen khel ke bhram main vah nakaaratmak yaa hinsak vichaar kii urja ko baahar nikaal dete hai
 i feel good after playing video games
 ’’dorji ne kaha, ‘‘video game main hinsak game khelnaa ek kaushal he jisamen main agar saamne vaale ko maar rahaa hum to yah vastav main main kisi ko haani nahin pahunchaa rahaa hum
 '' Video games have a negative effect on the eyes
 netra chikitsakon kii raay maane to pochimone jaise kai video game main achaanak se flash lite lagati he jo bacchon kii ankhon ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he
 So every half an hour should be explained to children to stop video games
 kendriya karmchaariyon ko narendra modi sarkaar ne saatven vetan ayog kaa tohfa tay saal main hi de diya
 At the Cabinet meeting in the last week of July, the government accepted the Pay Commission proposal almost completely
 1 janvari 2016 se is ayog kii report ko lagu karne kii baat sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon se kahi
 After this, the process of increasing the salary of the employees started
 saatven vetan ayog kii siforishein lagu hone ke saath hi kendriya karmchaariyon ke sanghathanon ne nunatam vetanman or fitment formula par aapatti jataai or anischitkaaleen hadtaal par jane kii taarikh ghoshit kar di
 The government negotiated with the staff leaders and sought a time of four months and then a round of negotiations began between the two sides
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar karmchaaree netaaon or sarkaar ke bich hui baatcheet main alouns ke mudde par kuch pragati hui he, lekin nunatam vetanman kaa mudda jas kaa tas bana hua he
 Sources are saying that the government has agreed to accept some of the demands of employees on the issue of allowances, but the official authorized by the government is not ready to speak anything on the increase in the minimum pay scale
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki karmchaaree netaaon ne sarkaar se saatven vetan ayog dwaara samaapt kiye gaye tamaam alounces main se kai ko phir chaalu karne kii maang kii he
 The government has also agreed to revive some allowances, but the matter has moved a little further
 karmchaaree netaaon ne sarkaar se maang kii he ki yah alouns pichley 100 saalon se bhi zyada samay se die ja rahe hai or inhen ekaek band karnaa thik nahin he
 He says that the government should consult every department in this regard
 vibhaag apane karmchaaree unionon ke saath baithak kar is maamle par koi nirnay len
 In this regard, when NDTV contacted the Secretary General of All India Railway Men's Federation and convenor of NJCA convenor, a joint organization of employee unions, they said that nothing concrete has come out in the meeting yet
 alances par mishra ne bataaya ki sarkaar ne hamase is bare main raay maangi thi
 We have put our point before the government
 aisa lagata he ki sarkaar kuch maangon ke sweekaar karne ko taiyaar he
 As far as the increase in the minimum pay scale is concerned, the government and staff leaders have met twice on this issue
 ek baithak formal thi yani tay mudda tha or duusari baithak main karmchaariyon ne yah mudda khud hi uthaaya tha
 Employees' organizations say that they are not in favor of putting more pressure on the government right now because the country's common citizens are facing a lot of problems due to demonetisation with central employees
 unhone sarkaar kaa dhanyavad bhi diya ki unhone notebandi se line main lage karmchaariyon ke hit main nirnay liya
 This will reduce the problems faced by the employees and they will be able to do their work better instead of staying in line
 kai muddon main ek mudda disability pension ko lekar bhi uthaa
 Now letter No
 f issued by the government
 nan
 ll / 2 / 2016- Through JCA (PT), it has been said that a meeting has been called for Anomaly mentioned in Disability Pension in Army
 yah baithak 1 disambar 2016 ke liye tay kii gai he
 The meeting will be chaired by the Secretary (P)
 baithak kaa samay 11 baje nirdhaarit kiya gaya he
 This meeting will take place in North Block
 tippaniyan Recently, the staff leaders have written a letter to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and have kept their things clear
 apni chitthee main karmchaaree netaaon ne 30 june 2016 ko vittamantri arun jetali se hui baatcheet kaa hawala bhi diya he
 Staff leaders have said that at the time, this was an attempt by the government to postpone the proposed employees' strike on 11 July 2016
 is dauraan vittamantri jetali, grahamantri rajnath singh, rail mantri suresh prabhu or kendriya mantri manoj sinha ke saath is baithak main karmchaaree netaaon ne saaf kaha tha ki saatven vetan ayog main nunatam vetanman or fitment formule se karmchaaree buree tarah aahat hai
 With the implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, the organizations of the central employees objected to the minimum pay scale and fitment formula and announced the date for going on an indefinite strike
 sarkaar ne karmchaaree netaaon se baatcheet kar chaar maheene kaa samay maanga or phir donon pakshon ke bich baatcheet kaa daur shuru hua
 According to information received from the sources, there has been some progress in the talks between the employee leaders and the government on the issue of allowance, but the issue of minimum wage remains the same
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki sarkaar alounces ke mudde par karmchaariyon kii kuch maangon ko maanane ko taiyaar ho gai he, lekin nunatam vetanman main badhotaree kii baat par sarkaar kii ore se adhikrut adhikari kuch bhi bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Sources reveal that the employee leaders have demanded the government to revive many of the allowances which were abolished by the Seventh Pay Commission
 sarkaar kuch alounces ko phir chaalu karne ko taiyaar bhi ho gai he, lekin maamla kuch hi aage badha he
 Employee leaders have demanded from the government that these allowances have been given for more than 100 years and it is not right to stop them all of a sudden

 In their letter, employee leaders have also referred to a conversation with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on 30 June 2016
 karmchaaree netaaon ne kaha he ki us samay 11 july 2016 ko prastaavit karmchaariyon kii hadtaal ko taalane ke liye sarkaar kii ore se yah prayaas kiya gaya tha
 During this meeting with Finance Minister Jaitley, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and Union Minister Manoj Sinha, the staff leaders had clearly said that the minimum pay scale and fitment formula in the Seventh Pay Commission are badly hurt
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar karmchaaree netaaon or sarkaar ke bich hui baatcheet main alouns ke mudde par kuch pragati hui he, lekin nunatam vetanman kaa mudda jas kaa tas bana hua he
 Sources are saying that the government has agreed to accept some of the demands of employees on the issue of allowances, but the official authorized by the government is not ready to speak anything about the increase in the minimum pay scale
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki karmchaaree netaaon ne sarkaar se saatven vetan ayog dwaara samaapt kiye gaye tamaam alounces main se kai ko phir chaalu karne kii maang kii he
 The government has also agreed to revive some allowances, but the matter has moved a little further
 karmchaaree netaaon ne sarkaar se maang kii he ki yah alouns pichley 100 saalon se bhi zyada samay se die ja rahe hai or inhen ekaek band karnaa thik nahin he
 He says that the government should consult every department in this regard
 vibhaag apane karmchaaree unionon ke saath baithak kar is maamle par koi nirnay len
 In this regard, when NDTV contacted the Secretary General of All India Railway Men's Federation and convenor of NJCA convenor, a joint organization of employee unions, they said that nothing concrete has come out in the meeting yet
 alances par mishra ne bataaya ki sarkaar ne hamase is bare main raay maangi thi
 We have put our point before the government
 aisa lagata he ki sarkaar kuch maangon ke sweekaar karne ko taiyaar he
 As far as the increase in the minimum pay scale is concerned, the government and staff leaders have met twice on this issue
 ek baithak formal thi yani tay mudda tha or duusari baithak main karmchaariyon ne yah mudda khud hi uthaaya tha
 Employees' organizations say that they are not in favor of putting more pressure on the government right now because the country's common citizens are facing a lot of problems due to demonetisation with central employees
 unhone sarkaar kaa dhanyavad bhi diya ki unhone notebandi se line main lage karmchaariyon ke hit main nirnay liya
 This will reduce the problems faced by the employees and they will be able to do their work better instead of staying in line

 Sources reveal that the employee leaders have demanded the government to revive many of the allowances which were abolished by the Seventh Pay Commission
 sarkaar kuch alounces ko phir chaalu karne ko taiyaar bhi ho gai he, lekin maamla kuch hi aage badha he
 Employee leaders have demanded from the government that these allowances have been given for more than 100 years and it is not right to stop them all of a sudden

 Rahul Kothari had done against Chief Minister Kamal Nath
 Tweeterul Kothari wrote that Sindhimandhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath was taken for immersion, posting objectionable photo on social media platform Twitter against Bharatiya Janata Party leader Rahul Kothari in Indore An FIR has been registered in darasal, bijepi netaa rahul kothaari ne 1 sitambar 2019 ko apadet twitor handle par ek photo post kii thi
 In which Chief Minister Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitu Patwari and Govind Singh Rajput are also seen
 photo main jyotiraditya sindhiya kamalnath ko sahaara dete dikhaai de rahe hai
 BJP leader's tweet: Actually, this is an old photo in which all the big leaders of Madhya Pradesh Congress were riding on the roof of the vehicle during the protest, during this time Jyotiraditya Scindia took over the balance of Kamal Nath when the blow came
 usee tasviir ko post karte hue rahul kothaari ne likhaa ki 'kamalnath ko visarjan ke liye le jate hue sindhiya'
 In connection with this tweet, Madhya Pradesh Congress Secretary Rakesh Yadav lodged a complaint against Rahul Kothari at Vijay Nagar police station in Indore
 shikaayat main congress netaa ne likhaa tha ki 'bhartiya janata yuva morcha ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh rahul kothaari ne twitor par mukhyamantri kamalnath ke khilaaf aapattijanak post share kii he
 He said that posting such a picture of the Chief Minister was done away with the dignity of constitutional post, while it also falls under the category of a crime, so an FIR should be lodged against Rahul Kothari under the sections of the IT Act
 shikaayat milane ke baad indore ke vijay nagar thane main rahul kothaari ke khilaaf dhara 499 ke tahat maamla darj kar liya gaya he
 After the FIR was registered against himself, BJP leader Rahul Kothari said that 'the FIR filed by the Congress against me is evidence of undisclosed emergency in the state
 bijepi kii aakraamakata se darkar kamalnath sarkaar kabhi pradarshan par jurmaana laga rahi he to kahin FIR darj karvaa rahi he'
 Kothari said that 'we will not bow down in front of such a puppet police, defaming the Chief Minister who does not believe
' mere khilaaf congress dwaara kii gai FIR pradesh main aghoshit apatkaal kaa saboot he,bhaajapa kii aakraamakata se darkar sarkaar kabhi pradarshan par jurmaana ,kahin FIR karakar,janata ke liye sangharsh ko nahin roak sakati
 What defamation of the Chief Minister who does not even respect! The puppets will not bow in front of the police nor stop the pic

 com / jqmatmvrah — Rahul Kothari Bjp (@rahulkotharibjp) September 2, 2019 payalat hona un chuninda naukariyon main se ek he jisamen bharpoor romaanch he
 You roam the world, looking at the beautiful views of the land from the sky is your daily pastime and every day you have something new to learn
 lekin iske saath hi yah ek aisa profeshan bhi he jo demanding to he hi saath hi vakt-bevakt kii flite or kaam ke lambey ghante sharir ko buree tarah thakaa dete hai
 However, it is also true that unaware of these difficulties, our innocent childhood must have dreamed of becoming a pilot at some time by impressing with a very stylish and bright dress
 khayr, puure khandaan main kya agar apane gali-mohalle main ek bhi payalat ho to naak oonchi ho jatihai
 But there is also a family in our own country India which has been in this profession for more than 100 years
 ji haa, ham baat kar rahe hai bhasin parivaar kii, jiske chaaron sadsy airlines main payalat hai
 Do not be surprised this is absolutely true
 bhasin parivaar kii teesri peedi ne bhi apane dadaji ke nakshe kadam par chalane kaa faisla kiya
 The family's association with this profession dates back to 1954 when Captain Jaydev Bhasin decided to go to Indian Airlines
 vah bharat ke un pehle saat payalton main shaamil the jo aage chalakar commander bane
 His son Rohit also made him his profession like his father
 iske baad rohit kii shaadi nivedita jain se hui jo khud bhi ek payalat thim
 At the age of 26, Nivedita became the world's youngest jet-flying female captain
 yah bhi padhein: mata-pita ne badhaayaa hausala, beti divya ne vishalkay plane udaakar rachaa itihaas According to Nivedita, who has had more than three decades of flying experience, "I used to be attracted to flying from the age of six or seven
" us din main apane friend kii berthde party main thi or tabhi mere papa haath main apointment lekar daude-daude chale aae
 My selection was done in Indian Airlines
 us din ko main kabhi nahin bhul sakati
 The date was 29 June 1984
 ' Nivedita was just 20 years old when she became a pilot of Indian Airlines
 33 baras kii umr main vah duniya ke sabase bade hawaii jahaaj airbas - 300 kii commander ban gayi thim
 Where were the children of such promising parents to stay behind? aaj unka betaa rohan bataur commander bowing 777 chalaata he or air india main use 10 saal ho chuke hai
 His 26-year-old daughter Niharika is a pilot in Indigo
 niharika kahati hai, 'jab main choti thi to mummy-papa ko taiyaar hote hue dekhati thi or main bhi ek din unki hi tarah taiyaar hona chaahati thi
 'let me tell you that Rohan is married to an HR professional while Niharika says that she wants to marry a pilot
 yah bhi padhein: 
 
 
 When Union Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy reached Raipur by flying an Indigo plane himself! yun to nivedita or rohan pichley kai saalon se ek hi profeshan main hai lekin donon ne kabhi ek saath jahaaj nahin udaaya he lekin pita rohit apane bete ke saath 10 se bhi zyada flite uda chuke hai
 Like other parents, Rohit and Nivedita advise their children to be more careful
 rohit kehete hai, 'kabhi-kabhi ham bhi ghabara jate hai
 We often keep advising them that when the weather is bad, do not rush to land, always fly with more fuel or do not show any haste, etc
 ' This family is not amazing
 inke profeshan or jazbe ko hamaara salaam
 Comments (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) chaunkiye mat yah bilkul sach he
 The third generation of the Bhasin family also decided to follow their grandfather's footsteps
 is profeshan se parivaar kaa naata 1954 se he jab captain jayadev bhasin ne indian airlisn main jane kaa faisla kiya
 He was among the first seven pilots of India who later became commanders
 unke bete rohit ne bhi apane pita kii tarah isi ko apana profeshan banaaya
 After this, Rohit was married to Nivedita Jain, who was also a pilot
 26 saal kii umr main nivedita duniya kii sabase kam umr kii jet udaane vaali mahila captain ban chuki thim
 Also read: Parents encouraged, daughter Divya created history by flying giant plane teen dashakon se bhi zyada kaa flying anubhav rakhane vaali nivedita ke mutabik, 'shaayad chah yaa saat saal kii umr se hi mujhe flying aakarshith karti thi
 That day i was at my friend's birthday party and then my father came and ran with an appointment in his hand
 meraa sellection indian airlines main ho gaya tha
 i can never forget that day
 taarikh thi 29 june 1984

 In the deserted area near the magnificent flats of Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which are being built in Narela and Bawana, about 40 km from Delhi's India Gate, you will see a big red colored shed

 Similarly, in this factory the roof, wall, beam related to the flats are readymade here and then added to the flat making sites

 Pakistan offered to cooperate fully in the investigation of the incident, because it believes that 'the attack is either a false betrayal of India to discredit Pakistan and divert the world's attention from Kashmir issue or the worst of the Indian government's terrorism Kashmiris, who were victims of many kinds of excesses, launched counter-attacks'

 aapako kisase khushi milti he? aisa prashn aapse baar-baar poocha jaataa he
 Ask yourself how do you find happiness? Are you happy with the business or are you happy for some other reason? Does anyone else decide whether you are happy or not? Do you believe that your happiness is predetermined and outside your control? For some people, wealth is the greatest happiness
 kuch logon ke liye yah panchataara hotalon ke khaane tak simit he
 Some people get pleasure from consuming drugs like heroin and some people consider alcohol and gambling as the only means of happiness
 kuch logon ke liye acha jivan saathi, badhiya naukari, acha bos, aagyaakaari bachche va mata-pita se patari baithna hi khushi ke paimaane ho sakate hai
 It is dangerous to get pleasure in alcohol and drugs
 aise shauk na keval thode samay ke liye balki dirghakaalin rup se bhi nuksaandaayak hote he
 The 'trade of happiness' has taken the form of a large industry
 kuch log pavitra mahapurushon kii sangati main anand pate hai or mukti kaa upaay talashte hai yadhyapi bharat jaise desh main sadhu ke rup main chhipe thagon kii bhi kami nahin he
 You can please yourself
 prasannataa koi apane aap aane vaali cheez nahin he
 For this you will have to try continuously
 jab aapako dusron kii khushi main hi khushi milane lagegi to aap khushi ke bheetar chipa raaj jaan lenge
 Remember that happiness is not always in wanting, praising or doing something
 jivan kii choti-choti baton main khushiyaan talaashen or maanakar chalem ki aap prasann hai
 One can get happiness by doing his favorite work
 yadi aap manachaaha kaam karne ja rahe hon to aapako sachhee prasannataa milti he
 Do some creative work, a useless person can never find happiness
 apni icchhaaen simit karke apane sadhano se santusht rahane main hi sachhee khushi chhipi he
 Those who cannot do anything do not have work
 khushi kaa ek rahasy yah bhi hota he ki aap apane hunar se samaaj, parivaar, sahakarmiyon va apane kaam aaen
 My own experience is that the day i do nothing, i feel restless
 ritairement ke baad bhi maine apane aapako lekhan kaary main vyast kar rakhaa he
 People say that i have maintained a very strict routine, but this is the biggest pleasure for me
 kai baar to mujhe lagata he ki ham jo karnaa chaahate hai yaa paanaa chaahate hai, uske liye ek jivan bahut thodaa he
 There is no lack of knowledge in this world
 apane bare main acchhee raay banaaen or apni yogyata kii kadra karen
 If you cannot respect yourself, do not expect it from others
 aap apane vishwaas se zyada upar nahin uth sakate
 As much as you respect yourself, people will respect you in the same proportion
 apni hi sangati main rahanaa seekhen or saath hi dusron ko bhi nicha na dikhaaen
 My friend Shriram always shares his sorrow with me, no matter where i find him
 ek din ek khushnuma shaam bitaane ke baad jab ham ghar laut rahe the usne mujhase kaha ki narendra ghamandi he, maine is bare main saaf inkaar kiya to usne badi niraashaa se kaha ki maine dhyaan nahin diya, ve log use nicha dikhaane kii koshish main lage rahete hai
 i told him that you get what you want from life

 Most parties welcomed it and it is being considered as perhaps the most important step of the Modi government in three and a half years
 vaise purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla jaise kuch logon ne isaki safalataa par andeh jataayaa he
 This is an indication that the government has shown willingness to adopt a path of unconditional negotiation for the first time instead of resolving the problem only on the strength of the army and police
 kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne 23 aktubar ko dilli main sharma kii bhoomika ke bare main bataate hue kaha, ‘‘bharat sarkaar ke pratinidhi ke rup main dineshwar sharma jammu-kashmir ke logon kii kanoonsammat aakankshaon ko samajhane ke liye baatcheet shuru karenge

 Barring a mild hint of dialogue in 2016, when some members of the all-party delegation led by Rajnath tried to negotiate with the separatists, the Center never gave any indication of the possibility of talks

 jammu-kashmir ke varisht police afasaron kaa kahana he ki dilli ne aise samay main yah kadam uthaaya he jab us par samjhauta karne kaa koi dabaav nahin he

 The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday in the case of Judge Loya's death
 sheersh court ne is maamle main SIT jaanch kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 The Congress party has raised questions on this decision
 guuruuvaar ko samvaadadaata sammelan kar congress party ne kaha ki is maamle main kai sawaal abhi bhi ansulajhe hai
 Randeep Surjewala said that two more comrades had also died after the death of Judge Loya
 is maamle main kai tarah ke aarope saamne aae
 The case should be investigated objectively
 surajevaala ne kaha ki aaj kaa din kaaphi dukhad he, jaj loya kii maut kaa jaanch maamla kaaphi gambhir tha
 He said that Vosohrabuddin was hearing the case in which Amit Shah's name came up
 supreme court ke is faisle ke baad bhi kai tarah ke sawaal baaki hai
 He raised a variety of questions
 1
 The case of Sohrabuddin and Prajapati was transferred to the judges in 2012
 jaj utpat kaa bhi transfar kar diya gaya tha
 2
 jaj loya ko 100 karod rupye kii rishwat, ek flats dene kii peshkash kii gai thi
 3
 jaj loya kii maut kaa heart atake se maut bataaya gaya tha
 But the ECG report also showed something like this
 4
 His defenses in Nagpur were removed
 5
 Judge Loya traveled from Mumbai via Nagpur by train
 6
 No record of Judge Loya stopping at Nagpur Rail Bhavan
 7
 The guest house where Judge Loya was staying had several rooms
 lekin teen jaj usee kamare main hi kyon ruke hue the
 8
 parivaar ko jaj loya ke kapadon main gardan ke paas khun mila tha
 9
 postmortem kii report main unka naam galat likhaa gaya tha
 10
 jaj loya kii maut ke baad do anya jajon kii bhi maut hui jis par bhi kai tarah ke sawaal hai
 He said that the people of India want answers
 jaanch se hi sab kuch spasht ho paaegaa
 But Judge Loya's case has not been investigated so far
 koi tay nahin kar saktaa ki maut prakritik he yaa nahin
 Can other documents and suspicious circumstances be excluded only on the basis of the statements of the judges
 unhone kaha ki jajon ne 164 CRPC ke tahat bayaan nahin diya, police ko diya bayaan adaalat main maanya nahin he
 He said that the investigation can remove the curtain of doubt
 jaj loya ke maamle ko supreme court ke jajon ne bhi press conference main uthaaya
 What is the decision of the court? The Supreme Court has rejected the appeal for an independent inquiry into the matter
 court ne kaha he ki maamle kaa koi aadhaar nahin he, isliye isamen jaanch nahin hogi
 The three-judge bench pronounced the judgment saying that there is no reason to doubt the statement of four judges, doubting them would be like doubting the institute
 sheersh court ne kaha ki is maamle ke liye nyaaypalika ko badnaam karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The Supreme Court reprimanded the petitioners while hearing
 supreme court ne kaha ki jin vakeelon ne ye yachika daali he, unhone iske jariye nyaaypalika ko badnaam karne kii koshish kii he
 This is like criminal contempt of court
 sheersh court ne kaha ki ye yachika raajnneetik phaayde or nyaaypalika kii prakriya par sawaal uthaane ke liye kiya gaya

 As soon as the talk of releasing 'sultan' on Eid, there was a ruckus in the trade
 har jagah charchaa shuru ho gai ki salmaan or shahrukh 2016 kii id par aamane-saamne honge
 But Shah Rukh made it clear at an event that there will be no confrontation between him and Salman at the box office
 tippaniyan Shahrukh Khan jokingly said on an event that there are 365 days in a year and 54 Fridays
 or ye swaabhaavik he ki koi na koi kisi na kisi shuukravaar ko takaraayega hi
 It is also a reality that because of the two films face to face, each other's business also kills
 magar rahi baat hamaari to main or salmaan achche dost ban chuke hai
 We can do everything together, except to release the film together
 yani yah baat tay ho gai ki ab salmaan or shahrukh kii filmein ek saath release nahin hongi, magar sawaal yah he ki koun hatega id se? 'rais' ke nirmaataa ritesh sidhvani ek akhbaar ko die bayaan main pehle hi kah chuke hai ki 'rais' kii release ko vah aage peeche nahin badhayenge kyonki 2016 kii id kii booking unhone pehle kii he
 On the other hand, film experts also believe that 'raees' is expected to be released on Eid because some part of this film has been shot, whereas 'sultan' has not even started, so it is possible that 2016 By the time Eid was not ready to be a 'sultan'
 shahrukh khan ne ek event par mazaakia andaaj main kaha ki saal main 365 din hote hai or 54 shuukravaar
 And it is only natural that someone will clash on some or the other Friday
 yah bhi hakeekat he ki do filmon ke aamane-saamne hone kii vajah se ek-dusre kaa bijness bhi maar khaataa he
 But it is our thing that Salman and i have become good friends
 ham donon sab kuch ek saath kar sakate hai, sivaa ek saath film relies karne ke
 That is, it has been decided that now Salman and Shahrukh's films will not be released simultaneously, but the question is, who will be removed from Eid? The producer of 'raees' Ritesh Sidhwani has already said in a statement to a newspaper that he will not pursue the release of 'raees' as he has booked the 2016 Eid
 vahiin filmon ke jaankaron kaa bhi maananaa he ki 'rais' kii id par release hone kii ummid zyaada he kyonki is film kaa kuch hissaa shoot bhi ho chukaa he vahiin 'sultan' abhi shuru bhi nahin hui he, aise main ye mumkin he ki 2016 kii id tak 'sultan' banakar taiyaar bhi na ho paae

 He started this by handing over the major responsibilities of the state to the new state president
 vishleshkon ke anusaar, mayawati ne pradesh kii kaman ranchal rajbhar ko saunpkar apane rukh kaa sanket bhi de diya he
 He has given more powers to the current state president of the party than former state president Swami Prasad Maurya

 This BSP leader said that till now Mayawati used to take a meeting of office-bearers in Lucknow on the 10th of every month, but now she has given this responsibility to the new state president Ramchal Rajbhar

 Will Sunny be able to return to his country? is kaam main uski koun madad karegaa
 What kind of feeling will he get in Pakistan, this is the story of Filmistan
 film kii sabase badi khaasiyat yah he ki yah filmon ke bare main baat karte hue bhi bahut shor paidaa nahin karti
 All the actors, whether old or new, are mimicry, there is a mention of the context of the films, a mandatory cricket match also comes, but everything remains melodious and simple
 film us darshan ko nae sire se aabaad karti he ki donon mulk ek hi samskruti or sarokaar kii jameen par khadey hai or dharm yaa rashtrawaad kii kathith diwaar unke bich faasla paidaa nahin kar sakati
 Sharib Hashmi has done an amazing job in Sunny's role in the film
 bilkul bhondu sa dikhataa banda camera dekhte hi chaukanna chita ban jaataa he or apni harakatein dikhaane lagata he
 Inaumul Haq has also done a lot of work in Aftab's role
 sidi bechney vaale ke armaan bhi hori banane ke ho sakate hai
 Aftab, who is intent on making Lollywood (pakistan's film industry) more than Bollywood, is sometimes pathetic and sometimes shows a lot of friendship
 aatankwaadiyon ke sargana bane kumud mishra ko pehali martabaa ek grey shed vaale role main dekha

 We saw him earlier in the comic-shed role
 magar yahaan paison ke pher main javaani ganvaa jehad kii kaid main fanse yuva aatankwaadi ke role main vah puraa nyaay karte hai apane role ke saath
 Needless to say that the casting of the film is very effective
 bharat-pakistan kii filmon kii tone yaa to bahut tikhi hoti he yaa phir jabaran dosti karaane ke aadambar main lipati
 But Filmistan keeps itself comfortably free from these two
 diarector riter nitin kakkad ne film main kahin bhi apni pakad dhili nahin hone di
 Holding the threads of tension, laughter and sensibility, their stitching continues to weave intricate but delightful crafts
 film kii lokation or becoground mujeec bhi isaki pramanikta ko majboot karne kaa kaam karata he

 Always in search of happiness and happiness is involved in human nature
 apni khushi tabhi sthai ban sakati he, jab ham khud se jude anya logon ko bhi hameshaa khush rakhen
 In such a situation, it is very important to keep your life partner happy in every possible way, so that life can be happy
 yahaan kuch aise tips die ja rahe hai, jise aap aajamaakar dekh sakate hai
 Keep on each other
 Faithful life should be happy, for this it is very important that the trust in the life partner is maintained
 yahi 'vishwaas' jivan ke mushkil halaat se bhi nipatane main sakasham banaata he
 Usually, even after a small problem, people are trying to get rid of their responsibilities by blaming each other
 yah galat pravriti he
 There is a need to avoid this
 shaq-subahe se rahen duurdaanpaty jivan main ek-duusare par kisi bhi tarah kaa shaq-subahaa na karen
 Maintain as much distance as possible from the disease of doubt
 kaha bhi gaya he ki shaq kaa ilaaj hakim lukaman ke paas bhi nahin tha
 Do openly on every issue, sometimes people make small things an issue and become angry with their life partner during everyday work
 mumkin he ki is dauraan donon ke bich saamaanya tareeke se samvaad bhi kaayam na ho paata ho
 It is better not to allow such a situation
 agar aisi naubat aa bhi jaae, to sabase pehle har masale par khulkar baat karen
 Also tell the likes and dislikes
 Tell each other what you like more about them
 unhen yah bhi bataaen ki koun-si baat naapsand he
 It is possible that no one is willing to change their habits at once, but doing so may be beneficial for both in future
 nirnay lene main bhi bhagidaarikoi bhi bada faisla aapasi sahmati se karen
 Be sure to know each other's opinion before making a decision
 khaskar mahilaon ko bhi nirnay lene main bhagidaar banaaen
 Avoid placing responsibility on each other for the decision even if the desired result is not there
 kaamkaaj main bantaayen hathajahan tak sambhav ho, ghar ke kaamkaaj main bhi apane partner kaa haath bantaayen
 With this work is done quickly and easily, as well as love juice dissolves in life
 mana ki aap bahut vyast rahaa karte hai or aapako ghar main pilav pakaane kaa vakt nahin miltaa, par aap ek cap garma-garam coffee banaakar to apane partner ke haathon main thama hi sakate hai
 Say sir, what do you think?

 aresas ke prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya ne aarakshan ko lekar apane bayaan par bhale hi safai de di ho, lekin unke pita or sangh ke pravaktaa tathaa bauddhik pramukh rah chuke emji vaidya ne kaha he ki SC-ST ke alaava baaki jatiyon ko mili aarakshan kii samiksha honi chahie
 MG Vaidya's statement MG Vaidya said that reservation for SC-ST is necessary as the condition of those castes is still not good
 anya jatiyon ko jo aarakshan he, jinke liye aarakshan he, unako uskaa laabh hua he yaa nahin, isaki samiksha ke liye ek nishpaksh samiti bananaa chahie
 Vaidya was also asked whether such statements by Sangh leaders would not harm the BJP in UP elections
 is par vaidya ne kaha ki jin rajyon main chunaav hone hai vahaan ke janamanas ko ve nahin jaanate isliye vahaan iskaa kya asar hoga, isapar wo kuch nahin kah sakate
 Does the Sangh want to reiterate Bihar in UP, then felt that Naraman Mohan Vaidya's statement of 'remove reservation' is wrong that RSS propaganda head Manmohan Vaidya said at Jaipur Literature Festival yesterday that BR Ambedkar, the creator of the Constitution, also always issued the reservation Did not support staying
 vaidya ne kaha ki anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati ke liye aarakshan kaa vishay ek alag sandarbh main aayaa tha
 It was provided in the constitution to remove the historical injustice done to them
 vah hamaari jimmedaari thi, isliye unke liye aarakshan kaa praavdhaan aarambh se kiya gaya
 Vaidya turned around to see the ruckus growing on the statement, said- RSS always advocated reservation, even though Ambedkar also said that it is not right to continue forever, there should be a deadline
 aseem rup se ise jari rakhane kii bajaay logon ko shiksha evam anya chizon ke liye samaan avasar muhaiyaa karaane ke prayaas hone chahie
 Continuation of this will promote separatism
 aarakshan khatm karne kii koshish hui to bijepi ko mitti main mila denge: mayawatiareses pramukh mohan bhagwat ne bhi bihar chunaav se thik pehle aarakshan niti kii samiksha kii jarurat hone kii aisi hi tippanee kii thi
 The BJP had to bear the brunt of this in the Bihar assembly elections as the vote of the backward classes was consolidated in favor of the Nitish Kumar-led grand alliance

 Geetika had written in the suicide note that Gopal Kanda's name did not come out even after 7 years
 Former Haryana minister Gopal Kanda, who came into the limelight in the Geetika suicide case, is once again in the headlines
 haryana main gathit hone ja rahi nai sarkaar main unke mantri banane kii afvaahon ko lekar aarope-pratyarope kaa silsilaa phir shuru ho gaya he
 Now let us tell you what is the Geetika Suicide Case, due to which the speculation of Gopal Kanda joining the Government of Haryana has been continuously opposed
 5 agast 2012 ko air hostess geetika ne aatmahatya kar lee thi or apane suicide note main likhaa tha ki vahagopal kandaase pareshaan hokar apni jaan de rahi he
 Before embracing the death, Geetika in her suicide note also accused Gopal Kanda and her associate accused Aruna Chaddha of harassing her
 gopal kanda ke khilaaf aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa aropashuruyaat main police kii taraf se is maamle main aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa maamla hegopal kanda par darjakiya gaya tha, lekin geetika ke suicide note ko dekhne ke baad dilli kii nichali adaalat ne kanda par balaatkaar ke maamle main trial chalaane kaa faisla diya
 Gopal Kanda challenged this in the Delhi High Court and ordered the High Court to drop the charges of rape and pursue a case of abetment to suicide
 dilli police ne is maamle main chusti dikhaate hue apni chargeshit bhi 2012 main hi daakhil kar di thi
 Gopal Kanda was released on bail in 2014 after being in judicial custody for 18 months following an order to have Gopal Kandahaicourt's rape charges dropped for 18 months
 is maamle main philhal dilli kii rouse avenue court main maamle kii sunwaayee chal rahi he
 There are more than 60 witnesses in this case, the statements of Geetika's family relatives and experts have been recorded in this case but the statements and evidence of the police officers experts and people associated with the medical team are still involved in the hearing of the case
 Are going rouj avenue court main maamle kii sunwaayee8 saal bitne ke baad bhi is maamle main lagaataar taarikh par taarikh milane ke chalate cese main abhi tak kuch khaas nahin ho paaya he
 In the same month, the judge summoned the prosecution director after the public prosecutor was absent in Rouse Avenue Court
 geetika kii maa ke aatmahatya karne or suicide note main unki beti ko nyaay na milane kii baat ko lekar bheegopal kanda ke khilaafusraa maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 But currently the case is stayed on hearing in the court, because Gopal Kanda's lawyers said that Gopal Kanda never had any contact with Geetika's mother, so the case of abetment of suicide should not be tried on Gopal Kanda
 Can
 geetika ke bhai ne uthaae sawalaharyana main chal rahi raajnneetik sthiti par air hostess geetika sharma ke bhai ankit sharma ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha, 'betiyon ko maarane vaala or unki life barbaad karne vaala kursi par baith jayega to betiyaan kaise surakshit hai
 How can a person who has a case of abetment to suicide be elected a leader
 7 saal se cese chal rahaa he or abhi saboot hi puure nahin hue
 In such a situation, when it comes to power, then the whole case will be ended
 phir yah sabit karne kii koshish kii jaaegi ki aisa koi cese hua hi nahin
