 par is aword ke liye film 'udata punjab' ke actor dilajit dosanjh ko chunaa gaya
 Angered by this, Harsh Vardhan said in an interview that 'though i have won two awards for my film, i was hopeful that i would also get the Filmfare Debut Award
 par mujhe lagata he ki har aword ke liye alag parameter hota he
 i will be honest haalanki mujhe lagata he ki debyue aword kisi bhi actor ko uski pehali film ke liye milanaa chahie, na ki use, jisane kai bhashaaon or industry kii filmon main kaam kiya ho
 'movie Review: The magic of love did not work' Mirzia 'taking a tweet on Harsh Vardhan's tweet, Filmfare executive editor Anuradha Chaudhary retorted that nowadays the newcomer actors are considering themselves as worthy and deserving of the award
 Can not even go
 iske saath hi anuraadhaa ne ritvit karte hue likhaa ki 'harshavardhan kapurko lagata he ki wo dilajit se zyada diserv karte hai, to apane acting ko behatar karen
 'the sense of self entitlement some of these newcomer actors have is beyond imagination
 If only they were half as talented

 NDA leaders have come out in defense on behalf of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, writing an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologizing for the DNA statement and withdrawing the word
 endie ke netaaon nenithish ke khat parajawab dete hue bihar kii janata ke naam patr likhakar puure maamle main apana paksh rakhaa or logon se raah na bhatakane kii apil kii
 Read the entire letter here - Dear sisters and brothers of Bihar, Bihar Chief Minister's letter issued this morning is very disappointing
 ham soch rahe the ki ye patr bihar kii pragati ko lekar hoga
 There will be progress for Bihar but we were thinking wrongly
 is patr ke bare main ‘khoda pahaad or nikali chuhia’ bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki isamen bihar or biharvasiyon kii unnati ke bare main ek shabd nahin he
 What has pained us is that Bihar, which has the potential to become the growth engine of the country, has been conspired to make the voice of Bihar clear, condemnable and thoughtful to make the voice of a man, a chief minister and his persistence
 bihar main logon ko haank kar apane ishaaron par chalaane kii koshish kabhi kaamyaab nahin hui he
 We would like to humbly say- 'bihar is not Nitish Kumar and Nitish Kumar is not Bihar
 main hi bihar hum, yah nitish kaa bhram he
 The letter from the Chief Minister of Bihar describes the extent to which a person can go for his persistence and power
 saaf he ki mukhyamantri kaa ye kadam bihar ke lokachar ke anuroop nahin he
 Bihar is a land of democracy, tolerance, dialogue and visionary leadership
 bihar se hi bhagwaan buddha ne shanti or sahishnutaa kaa sandesh diya
 It is Bihar whose history is rich in democratic traditions and it is Bihar which has the ability to honor the invaders like Alexander
 garibon, vanchit, shoshit or mahadaliton kaa apmaan bihar kii samskruti nahin he, lekin shri nitish kumaar ko aisa karne main hi anand aata he
 This shows that Mr
 Nitish Kumar's advisors have once again failed
 lekin, isamen achraj kii baat nahin, kyonki isse pehle bhi wo apane aasapaas rahane vaale chatukaaron kii mandali ke bahekaave main aakar maanane lage the ki wo bharat ke pradhanmantri ban sakate hai
 Due to this he also broke his alliance with BJP
 uske baad itihaas sakshi he ki kya hua
 However, one can only expect so much from Mr
 Nitish Kumar that he will understand words and issues
 pradhanmantri ne 26 july ko mujffarpur ke apane bhaashan main shri nitish kumaar ji kii raajnneetik yatra ke bare main ekadam sateek or praasangik tippanee kii, jise hamaari (or anya kai logon kii bhi) raay main chal, kapat or ehsaanfaramoshi ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 The Prime Minister's statement was about the political DNA of Mr
 Nitish Kumar (not Bihar) (nor about his or Bihar's DNA, as he mischievously promoted it)
 shri nitish kumaar, pradhanmantri ko likhane se pehle aap kripaya apane raajnneetik laabh ke liye pradhanmantri ke shabdon ko todane-marodane or bihar ko nicha dikhaane ke liye bihar kii janata se maafee mangiye
 We want to tell the people of Bihar that there has been a significant increase in the progress of Bihar in the last one year after the NDA came to power
 baat chahen mantralayon main pratinidhitiv kii ho, sansadhano ke aavanton kii ho yaa vikaas pariyojnaon ke puraa hone kii ho, bihar hameshaa praathamikta par rahaa he
 To those who said that the Prime Minister never visited Bihar in these 14 months, we have to say whether he ever expressed disappointment when the last Prime Minister was given the opportunity to come to Bihar, except for an air survey done once in his ten years of tenure
 did not get
 shri nitish kumaar ke raajnneeti kii ABCD he- Arrogance, Betrayal, Conspiracy and Deceit
 No wonder Mr
 Lalu Prasad Yadav said about him, there is no such thing, which Nitish did not cheat
 priy lalu ji se behatar unhen koun jaanata he
 And has he ever written an open letter to say so
 bihar ke mukhyamantri ne jepi or lohia kaa uddhran bhi diya he, lekin hamen ye sochakar bhi kanpakpi aati he ki jepi or lohia ji is nai dosti, or jinhen wo saport kar rahe hai (pehle chupchaap or ab khulkar), unke bare main kya kehete
 After all, how can they be free from the sin of supporting UPA 2, the most corrupt government of independent India till date
 jab shri nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke saath gathbandhan todaa to aap jaanate hai ki sabase bada nuksaan kya hua- bihar ke vikaas or bihar ke logon kii aakankshaon par kutharaghaat
 You voted for the NDA with hopes of development
 or ye ummid ek vyakti ke hath or mahatvakanksha ke aage bikhar gai
 After the break-up of the alliance, both the tenures of Shri Nitish Kumar have exposed the myth of 'good Governance Babu'
 iske alaava, hamen khushi is baat kii he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri ko ek nayaa kaam mil gaya he- shri narendra modi ko patr likhane kaa kaam
 He has also created a special website for this
 hamen vishwaas he ki ye pehla patr he or baaki aane vaale hai, kyonki november 2015 ke baad unke paas patr likhane ke liye khub samay hoga
 The special thing is that now we see him posting letters through those mediums, which he used to reject earlier as trivial
 bihar ke bahanon or bhaiyon, ab nirnay aapako karnaa he
 Do we want those who want to distract us from the real issues or do we want a team that will put every moment for the progress of Bihar and make Bihar the most developed state in India
 bihar main vikaas or sushasan kii chahat he, na ki ghisi-pity raajnneeti, ahankaar kii ladaai or ‘jangal raaj’ kii
 Always your Ram Vilas Paswan, Jeetan Ram Manjhi, Upendra Kushwaha, Sushil Modi, Dr

 In the ongoing campaign for population control across the country, till now the slogan used to be, 'hum do, hamare do'
 lekin rajasthan sarkaar kii maane to ab yah naaraa ho gaya he 'ham do hamaare anek'
 In fact, for the last two years, the statute of limitation of two children for appointment to government posts in the state was being defused through departmental circulars
 lekin ab rajasthan sarkaar ne cabinet se prastaav paarit kar jansankhya niyantran ke sarkari naukari se jude pravaadhanon ko hi khatm kar diya he
 Explain that the Rajasthan government has abolished the law related to suspension for giving birth to more than three children of government employees
 isse pehle do bacchon ke pita hone par sarkari naukari se roak kaa kanoon vasundhara sarkaar ne waapas liya tha
 After this, in November 2016, the rule to stop promotion and increment on the birth of more than two children after getting a government job was abolished
 is maamle main rajasthan ke kanoon mantri rajendra rathod kaa kahana he ki rajasthan main jansankhya thik se nahin bad paa rahi he
 Hence these restrictive laws are being abolished
 buudhvaar ko cabinet ne prastaav paarit kar civil seva adhinium main sanshodhan kar do bacchon ke kanoon ko khatm kar diya he
 Former Vice President Bhairo Singh Shekhawat enacted a law for population control, but Rajasthan's population was not increasing for many years

 Explain that Rajasthan is known as a progressive state for its population control provisions
 jahaan purv mukhyamantri bhairo singh shekhavat se lekar ashok gahalot ne kai kadam uthaae the
 In 1992, a law was made to stop the father of more than two children in government jobs
 uske baad 2002 main sarkari naukari main rahete hue do se zyada bacchon par pramotion or inkrement rokane kaa kanoon bana
 Then there was a law for suspension of more than three children

 The government is spending crores of rupees on the promotion of population control
 pichley teen saalon main jansankhya niyantran ke prachaar-prasar main 25 karod rupye sarkaar ne kharch kiye gaye hai
 To reduce the population, the expenditure on programs like Nasambadi has been added, in three years, 110 crore rupees have been spent

 Vajiri said the government has a fleet of 6,500 buses to cater to the needs of public transport and 4000 buses will be added in a phased manner

 baghdad main ek shaks apane ghar se niklaa, usne chauraahey par apni maut khadi dekhi, vah bhaagta hua ghar lautaa, usne apane maalik se kaha ki uski maut saamne khadi he, vah use apana ghoda de den to vah bhagkar samaara chalaa jaae
 The owner gave him the horse
 kuch der baad maalik niklaa to use bhi vahi maut khadi dikhi
 He asked, why did you scare my friend? Why was she staring at him? Death said, 'I was surprised myself, what is he doing here
 usase to chaar ghante baad meri mulaakaat samaara main honi thi
 ' maut se aap batch nahin sakate
 The Buddha had understood in his childhood that illness comes, old age comes and death comes

 parivaar toote hue hai, bachche pariwaron se dur hai, maa-pita akele hai, tole-mohalle khatm ho gaye hai, flaton main katate jivan ke bich badhata budhapa ek laailaaj beemaari main badalata jaataa he
 In a very subtle but cruel process, we all become partners
 ichha mrityu isi krur prakriya se nikalne kii ek lambii aakiri saans jaisi gali he
 If the Supreme Court did not open this street, then the frustrations would become bigger, which makes such options worth trying in our time
 shaayad yah faisalaa kuch logon ko yaad dilaae ki unke apane itane akele or hataash na chhot jaaen ki apni mrityu ke liye apana medical board banavaane lagen
 This is a very good wish, but there is also beauty and spontaneity of life left between such wishes

 Actually life has its value in this
 ham jitna apane liye jite hai, utana hi dusron ke liye bhi
 We belong to others, we belong to others
 lekin nae samay ke dabaav sabko akelaa kar rahe hai
 Families are broken, children are away from families, parents are lonely, neighborhoods are gone, growing old age turns into an incurable disease in the flats
 ek bahut baarik magar krur prakriya main ham sab jaise bhagidaar hote chalate hai
 Desire death is a long last breath-like alley from this cruel process
 supreme court agar yah gali na kholta to ve hataashaaen or badi hoti jaatin jo hamaare samay main aise vikalpon ko bhi aajamaae jane laayak banaati hai
 Perhaps this decision reminds some people not to be left so lonely and desperate to have their own medical board set up for their deaths
 yah bahut sadashay kaamana he, lekin aisi hi kaamanaayon ke bich jivan kii sundarataa or sahajata bachati bhi he

 Robert Vadra, who came to Jiyarat in Ajmer, said that the manner in which Priyanka Gandhi has been defended is worrisome
 unhone kaha, ham log ghar main baithe the, koi meeting chal rahi thi or achaanak se ek esayuvi ai or kuch log hansate hue ghar ke andar aa gaye
 He said that we want to take selfie
 wadra ne kaha, is tarah se koi ghar ke andar aa jaae to roak nahin sakate lekin jis tarah se gandhi parivaar ke saath hua he, chaahe wo indira gandhi hon yaa phir rajeev gandhi, yah gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he
 Robert Vadra said, the government arranges for security
 kabhi ek bill ko lekar aati he or kabhi us main pherbadal karti he
 Do not understand what she wants to do
 suraksha kii jimmedarisarkaaraki he
 We cannot say that the government is angry with us, hence withdrawing our security
 kis tarah kii suraksha deni he sarkaar tay kare
 He said, our security alone is not a matter
 desh bhar main mahilaon kii suraksha kii baat he
 Girls are not feeling safe in the country
 main ek ladki kaa pita hum or isliye pareshaan ho jaataa hum ki yah sab kya ho rahaa he
 On the ongoing investigation into the land dispute, Vadra said that it is started deliberately
 mujhe jab bhi bulaayaa jaataa he main puraa sahyog karata hum
 One thing is asked which is not remembered yet i tell
 5-10 ghante mujhe baithaaya jaataa he
 Even when i go to the bathroom, two people go there with me but i do not panic
 kanoon main meraa puraa vishwaas he or jitani baar bulaayenge or jitne ghante baithaayenge main sahyog karuunga kyonki mere paas chhipaane ke liye kuch nahin he
 Robert Vadra has said about the security lapse of Priyanka Gandhi that the Blem game should not run that it was its fault, it was its fault
 jisaki suraksha kii jimmedaari hoti he suraksha vah dekhtaa he
 Whenever there is talk of beach in India, the name of Goa, Kerala, Andaman comes on everyone's tongue
 is kadi main vishakhapattanam bahut peeche chhot jaataa he
 Though Rushikonda Beach and Ramakrishna Beach are somewhat famous, but people still do not turn to Visakhapatnam to enjoy the beach
 durghatana he ek bada muddahkuch hafte pehle vishakhapattanam ke aarake bich main 5 logon kii doobane se maut ho gai thi
 According to statistics, in the last 10 years, 465 people have died due to drowning
 log doobane ke dar se bhi samudr main nahin jate
 The government is coming up with a new concept to get rid of this problem
 iskaa naam he- 'si pool'
 What is sea-pool: sea-pool is a swimming pool built on the seashore
 doobane se bachane ke liye samudr main swimming-pool banaaya jaataa he, jisamen aap bina kisi dar ke tairaaki kaa majaa le sakate hai
 In this, pools are surrounded by the sea or on the shore
 sabase pehla si-pool england ke samarlij bich par 1930 main banaaya gaya tha
 The pool is open for tourists from May to September
 vishakhapattanam main kahaan-kahaan banegaa si-poolivishakhapattanam main si-pool payalat basis par banaaya jayega
 Firstly there is talk of building this pool at Rushikonda, Sagarnagar, Lawson's Bay and Mangamaripeta as they are considered safe for swimming
 chile ke san alfonso del maar bich, sidney ke bondi bich or yues or south-africa ke anya pulon ke tarj par vishakhapatnam main si-pool banane kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 Sea-pools are also built in the US and South Africa to control water temperature and avoid shark-attacks
 adhikariyon ko chennai ke marina bichmodel kaa adhyayankarne ke liye bhi kaha gaya he
 If this project is successful, preparations will start to build a sea pool on the 23 km beach corridor
 ye pool sirf suraksha hi nahin badhayenge balki logon ke manoranjan main ijapha bhi karenge
 The Department of Tourism will fund this project
 suraksha hogi kadihpulice departmentco suraksha kii jimmedaari di gai he
 Also 10 watch-towers will be installed there, so that all people can be monitored
 ol train whical, life gards, inflateble boats kii bhi puri vyavastha vahaan rakhi jaaegi
 If this plan is successful, the first destination of coast-lovers will be Visakhapatnam itself and it will also greatly benefit the tourism of Visakhapatnam
 shivaji maharaj kii jayanti (shivaji Jayanti) ke din puraa desh unhen yaad kar rahaa he
 Shivaji Maharaj (shivaji Maharaj) was born on 19 February 1630 in the Shivneri fort
 unka puraa naam shivaji bhonsle tha
 His mother Jijabai and father Shahji Bhonsle
 unka janm shivaner durg main hua tha
 Shivaji was adept in many arts, having studied politics and war in his childhood
 6 june 1674 ko shivaji mughalon ko parrast kar laute the or unka maratha shaasha ke rup main rajbhishek hua tha
 Shivaji Maharaj was married to Saibai Nimbalkar on 14 May 1640 at Lal Mahal, Poona
 unke putr kaa naam sambhaji tha
 Let me tell you that in the freedom struggle of India, many people took inspiration from Shivaji's life and sacrificed their body, mind and wealth
 shivaji (shivaji Maharaj) kii paitruk jaaydaad bijapur ke sultan dwaara shasit dakkan main thi
 Sultan of Bijapur, Adil Shah removed his army from many fortifications and handed them over to the local rulers
 16 varsh kii aayu tak pahunchate-pahunchate unhen vishwaas ho gaya ki hinduon kii mukti ke liye sangharsh karnaa hoga
 Shivaji gathered his confidants and started increasing his strength
 jab adilshaah biimaar padaa to bijapur main araajaktaa fail gai
 Shivaji took this opportunity and decided to enter Bijapur
 choti si umr main hi unhone torna kile kaa kabja hasil kar liya tha
 In 1659, Adilshah sent his commander to kill Shivaji Maharaj
 donon ke bich pratapgarh kile par yuddh hua
 He was victorious in this war
 shivaji kii badhati takat ko dekhte hue mughal samraat aurangzeb ne jai singh or dilip khan ko shivaji ko rokane ke liye bheja
 He asked Shivaji to sign an agreement
 samjhaute ke mutabik unhen mughal shaasha ko 24 kile dene honge
 After the agreement, Shivaji Maharaj went to meet Aurangzeb at the court of Agra
 vah 9 may, 1666 isvi ko apane putr sambhaji evam 4000 maratha sainikon ke saath mogul darbar main upasthit hue, parantu aurangzeb dwaara uchit sammaan na praapt karne par shivaji ne bhare hue darbar main aurangzeb ko vishwasghaatee kaha
 With this Aurangzeb imprisoned him and his son in 'jaipur Bhavan'
 shivaji 13 agast, 1666 isvi ko falon kii tokari main chhipakar faraar ho gaye or ko raigarh pahunche
 By 1674, Shivaji had captured all the territories which had to be given to the Mughals under the Treaty of Purandar

 In Bollywood, Anurag Kashyap spoke on the issue of casting couch and sexual exploitation by powerful people
 anuraag ne kaha ki chijen ab badal rahi hai
 Every human being should see himself first
 hollywood produsar harvi vinstin par 50 se zyada abhinetriyon ne yon shoshan ke aarope lagaae the
 After this, the discussion of casting couch also started in Bollywood
 anuraag kashyap ne kaha, samay badal rahaa he or ye acha he ki ab peedit khulkar aropiyon ke khilaaf bol rahi hai
 It is everywhere, not just in the entertainment industry
 hamen khud ko dekhakar yah karnaa he ki ham kaise insaan hai
 ram-sakshi will again liplock, Ekta Kapoor repeating her mistake! meraa driver uttar bharat se he
 When he sees a woman driving around him, he says why do they drive when they don't know how to drive a car
 purushon ke dimag main rahata he ki unhen mahilaon ko kaabo main karnaa he
 Ekta has also spoken about this before Anurag
 unka kahana he ki sirf produsar yaa powerful log hi yon shoshan nahin karte, balki actor khud bhi kaam paane ke liye apni sexuality kaa istemaal karte hai
 This is the other side of the matter, which nobody talks about
 'nashe main jitendra ne kii thi rape kii koshish', padhein shikaayat main kagin ne kya likhabakaul ekta, mujhe lagata he ki bollywood main harvi vinstin maujuud hai, lekin is kahani kaa ek doosraa pahalu bhi he, jis par log baat nahin karnaa chaahate
 Yes, it is true that there are powerful people like producers in the industry, who take advantage of their power wrongly, but on the other hand there are actors who use their sexuality to get work
 mujhe lagata he ki aise logon ko power ke ek khaake main rakhkar nahin dekhnaa chahie
 It is not always true that one who does not have power, must suffer
 ekta kapur ne aage kaha, ek produsar hone ke naate jab main apane purush samakakshon se baat karti hum to ve bataate hai ki unhen sidhe taur par prastaav milte hai

 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and AYUSH Minister of State SY Naik released the International Yoga Day logo on Wednesday
 sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ne beete 11 disambar ko bharat kii aguwai main laayaa gaya ek prastaav sweekaar kar21 june ko ‘antarrashtriya yoga diwas’ghoshit kiya tha
 a three-month strenuous proposal was accepted after Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested this idea
 is maukey par sushamaa ne kaha, ‘yahaan main teen mahatvapurn baaten rakhana chaahuungi
 First, the announcement was made soon after India's initiative
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘pradhanmantri ne pichley saal 27 sitambar ko sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main apane sambodhan ke dauraan yah prastaav rakhaa tha
 The day agreed upon is because it is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere
 'videsh mantri ne kaha, ‘duusari baat yah ki 75 dinon kerecord samay ke andar prastaav paritkiya gaya or teesri baat yah ki yah aisa pehla prastaav tha jisamen 177 desh vishwa yoga diwas ke liye sah-praayojak bane the
 This is a world record
 ' unhone kaha, 'nelson mandela kaa janmdin manaane ke liye 165 desh sah-prayojak bane the

 aayush mantralay kii ore se gathit yoga visheshgyon kii samiti ne ‘logo’ kaa chayan kiya or pradhanmantri ne ise apni manjuuri di
 People have displayed harmony and peace for humanity which is an integral element of yoga
 bhashaa se input The result of the election for the 16th Lok Sabha not only dismantled many beliefs related to Bihar, but also indicated a change in the old caste equation
 vaise bihar main jaateey sameekaran par chunaav lade jane kii baat puraani he, parantu is chunaav ke baad yah tay ho gaya he ki raajnneetik dalon ke jaateey samikarnon kii deevaaren darak rahi hai
 This also indicates the emergence of a new caste equation in Bihar
 bihar main congress kaa prabhaav kam hone ke baad bihar kii raajnneeti kshetreey kshatrapon ke irdagird gumti rahi thi, parantu pichley varsh bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or janata dal united (jediu) kaa gathbandhan tuutane ke baad sabhi pramukh raajnneetik dalon ne nae jaateey sameekaran kii talash karne lage the
 In such a situation, the major political parties of Bihar took full care of their caste equations even in the ticket distribution in the elections
 rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) ne is chunaav main 17 savarnon ko tikat diya or usamen 14 jite
 The three upper caste candidates who lost were outgoing mps
 bhale hi endie ke adhikansh savarna pratyaashee chunaav jeet gaye hon, magar jediu or rashtriya janata dal (argedy) kaa koi bhi savarna pratyaashee vijayi nahin ho sakaa
 JDU fielded 10 and RJD and Congress alliance fielded eight upper caste candidates
 argedy kaa maai (muslim-yadav) sameekaran bhi is chunaav main darakta najar aayaa
 There are many seats where voters of both these castes are more, but there RJD had to face defeat
 argedy or congress gathbandhan ne is sameekaran ko dhyaan main rakhte hue 11 yadav jati ke pratyaashee vibhinn kshetron se chunaav maidan main utaare the, magar sirf do yadav pratyaashee hi jeet kaa sehara pahan sake
 The NDA had given tickets to four Yadav leaders
 in sabhi ne chunaav jitkar argedy ke yadav-muslim votbank main send maarane kaa ahsaas karaayaa
 The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) fielded eight Muslim candidates, but only its Muslim candidates could win from Katihar, Araria and Kishanganj
 narendra modi ke naam par bijepi se alag hue jediu ne muslim matadaataaon ko bharsak aakarshith karne kii koshish kii
 Under this, JDU fielded 13 Muslim candidates, but not a single Muslim candidate could succeed
 mana jaataa he ki jediu ke ranneetikaron ko muslim maton kaa bharosa tha, parantu isamen unhen safalataa nahin mili he, balki duusari taraf bijepi ko lok janashakti party (algepi) or rashtriya lok samta party (araspi) ke saath gathbandhan karnaa phaayde kaa sauda prathit hua lagata he
 The NDA has won all the reserved seats
 gopalganj, sasaram or gaya jahaan bijepi ke paksh main aayaa, vahiin hajipur, jamui, samastipur se algepi ke pratyaashee vijayi hue hai
 Similarly, two candidates of Kushwaha caste have won from NDA, while three candidates from very backward caste have won the election

 The reconstruction of Kedarnath in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand is in the final stages

 Says Bisht, "kedarpuri, Gaurikund-footpath is being carried out unscientifically at the mouth of the glacier's molasses or silt and the Avalanch shoot (glacier-swept waterway)
 yah aapadaa ko dobaaraa nyotaa dene jaisaa he
 “this new construction is being done with the view of turning Kedarnath into a big tourist destination, not just a pilgrimage place
 yahi vajah he ki pehle kii kedarpuri se yah kai guna bada ho gaya he
 It is difficult to say here that six helipads have been made for rescue operations in the event of a possible disaster, which will not be commercially used later
 suraksha ke or bhi intjamaat kiye gaye hai
 For example, three-tier walls and concrete buildings have been erected
 lekin vaigyanik is sab par gahare sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 Some experts also say that this construction was not done keeping in mind the ecology and reality of the Himalayas

 Says Bisht, "kedarpuri is settled on the silt brought by the glacier from the hills on both sides
 kedaar kaa matlab hi hota he daldali bhoomi
 Silt is a mixture of clay and pebbles
 jab isamen pani kaa risaav hota he to yah looj material bah jaataa he
 As a result, landslides occur

 Actually, Kedarnath is one of the four dhams of Hindus
 baarah jyortelingon main sabase oonchai par sthit jyortiling bhi yaheen he
 This is the reason that when the disaster struck on Kedarnath in 2013, in which thousands of people lost their lives, thousands were injured and around five lakh were directly and indirectly affected, the whole country was shocked
 isi vajah se or aasthaa kaa centre hone ke naate bhi kedarnath ke punarnirmaan par siyasat kaa silsilaa bhi khub chalaa
 After all, this hilly state and in a sense, the whole country also becomes an excuse to cover the remaining issues and issues
 isi rajnatik hode ne is nae nirmaan kii neenv rakhi, jis par nae sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 But political parties are cooking some other khichdi by turning away from these questions
 bade siyaasi daurekedarnath ke punarnirmaan kaa kaary ab aakhri charan main he
 In such a situation, there is a competition to take credit between the BJP and Congress, both the major political parties of the country and the state
 donon hi dalon ke rajya str ke hi nahin, rashtriya netaa bhi siyaasi sandesh dene ke liye kedarnath ke darbar main dastak de rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Kedar on October 20, a day before Kedar closed its doors and offered prayers at Rs 150 crore

 These include the construction of the Ghats of Mandakini, modernization of the paths of the Kedarnath temple complex, the reconstruction of the shrines of the Tirtha priests, the work of flood protection of the ghats and banks of the Saraswati river, including the construction of the shrine and museum of Shankaracharya
 congress ke netaa bhi peeche nahin hai
 Shortly before the Prime Minister's second Kedarnath visit, Congress leader and former Chief Minister Harish Rawat also came to Kedarnath
 harish ravat maang kar rahe hai ki kedarpuri ke liye unke kaarykaal main vikaas kaaryon ke liye prastaavit 7,000 karod rupye kii dhanrashi kii bakaayaa rakam jaldi hi jari honi chahie
 Harish Rawat also alleged that Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat's BJP government is ignoring the Kedarnath region
 iskaa nateeja yah hoga ki 2018 main yahaan pachaas lakh tirthayatriyon ko laane kaa lakshya puraa nahin ho saktaa
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi went on a tour of Kedarnath at the same time when the region was trying to recover from the disaster
 24 april, 2016 ko rahul gandhi paidal chalakar mandir gaye or uske surakshit hone kaa sandesh duniya ko diya
 To give some similar message, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also reached there when the doors of the temple opened
 modi phir kapaat band hone se ek din pehle bhi vahaan maujuud rahe
 The reconstruction NIM After the disaster of 2013, the team of about three hundred people of the country's prestigious mountaineering institute Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) in Uttarkashi in Kedarnath were engaged in a special campaign
 ab yah team is kshetra ko nai shakl de chuki he jo uske mutabik kathith taur par paryaavaran or ilaake kii bhugolic vaastaviktaaon ke anuroop to he hi, yahaan kii aadhyatmik manyataon ke bhi anuroop he
 Now experts are questioning this claim
 june 2013 kii aapadaa ke dauraan aae malbe se khatarnaak ho gai imaaraton ko bhi hataakar nayaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Due to the disaster, the debris filled here raised the land around Kedarnath by 10 to 15 feet

 is helicopter ko utaarne ke liye saadhe teen maheene main dedh sau meter lanbaa or pachaas meter chaudaa helipad taiyaar kiya gaya
 Six helipads were built, wide roads to be used in rescue operations to deal with such disasters in future

 While only 40 thousand pilgrims came to Kedarnath in 2014 after the disaster, all the previous records in terms of number of passengers have been broken so far this year

 Political construction competition: After the Kedarnath disaster, it was not easy to think that the Kedarnath yatra would begin within a year
 isaki ek vajah to yah thi ki kedarnath ghati or uttarakhand main logon kii jindagi yatra par hi nirbhar he
 Nearly 30 percent of the state's population lives on the income from travel lasting about 6-7 months in a year

 At the same time, Narendra Modi, the bjp's prime ministerial candidate for the Lok Sabha elections, was also engaged in a campaign of bluster

 asamanta par nai dilli main hone vaali nitigat bahasein garibi, lagaataar girte gini suchakank ('bhartiya aay asamanta, 1922- 2014'' lucas chancel or thomas picketti) par kendrit hoti hai yaa phir is par ki kaise upar ke 1 fisadi logon ne rashtriya aamadani ke 22 fisadi hisse par kabja jamaaya hua he jabaki nichle aadhe hisse ke khate main sirf 15 fisadi aata he
 (world Inequality Report 2017)
 lekin sadak par juluus-jalse main utre log gaiyr-barabari ko avasaron kii asamanta ke rup main dekhte hai
 This thing really looks like an address
 salanaa mahaj 1,710 dollar kii prati vyakti aay (jabaki america main prati vyakti aay 57,000 dollar or china main 8,100 dollar he) se saaf sanket miltaa he ki abhi hamen vikaas kii disha main lanbaa safar tay karnaa he
 Our real estate i
e
 45 crore citizens below the age of 18 years has yet to start their journey
 unke liye (bazaar, sevaaon or sthaan ke maamle main) badhate maukon tak unki pahunch kii maatra hi gaiyr-barabari maapne kaa paimaana ho sakati he
 But, when most of the experts are loudly claiming that our economic growth rate of 10% will remove all our problems, what is the need to worry about non-barabari? Developed countries try to maintain a steady productive growth rate here
 aisa lagata he ki yah vruddhi kulamilaakar vyaktiyon ke saath samaaj ko bhi fyida pahunchaati he
 Two factors make development long-term and sustainable: consistent social mobility and every human being connected to it
 vikaas kaa vrutt har vyakti ko samaan rup se or ek saath laabh nahin pahunchaata
 This is often due to the difference in natural edge such as how educated a community is, or how much access it has to ports or fertile lands, etc
 yaa phir sarkari puunji ke aavanton se bhi antar paidaa ho saktaa he, jaise sadakon ke badale hawaonddon main nivesh, sinchai par dhyaan ho yaa police bal par, koi vicasonmukhi netaa chunaa jaae yaa kisi samjhaute se upja ummidavaar
 Whatever the reasons, the reality is that people choose different paths of development
 phir unhen yah bhi yakeen dilaanaa chahie ki unke saath koi gadabadi nahin kii ja rahi he
 They have to believe that one day they too will get a chance
 varanaa asantosh kii dhvaniyaan virodh main tabdeel ho jaati hai
 If they are not heard, people raise 'someone else' and reject the entire system by voting in favor of redundant political options
 bracit or trump iske do udhaaharan hai
 So, do all Indians believe that they have easy access to opportunities, places and services? Basic services and subsidies should not be an opportunity
 sattar saal ke loktantr ne sadiyon se gaiyr-barabari par aadhaarit sabhyataa main ek nayaa aayam jo diya he ki har bhartiya janm se baraabar he
 The efforts of the state include availability of basic services, enrollment in schools, the world's largest food security program, rural roads and, now, electricity and accessible housing for all
 hamaari baari aabaadi or kshetra ke maddenjar ye sab aasaan kaam nahin
 So, what is the challenge? These governmental measures are not enough to maintain parity
 har yuva ko avasaron tak apni pahunch banane ke liye use swasth, hunarmand hona chahie or use aise samudaay se hona chahie jisamen nitiyon kii vajah se uske hunar or ummiido ke anusaar paryaapt rojgaar avasar (nijee yaa sarkari) paidaa hote hon
 The fact is that about 48 percent of children develop due to maternal health and hygiene
 aparyaapt dhaanche or upyukt adhyaaapak prashikshan ke abhaav main 40 fisadi bachche aathvin kaksha tak pahunchate-pahunchate skool chhod dete hai,12 fisadi se bhi kam yuva graduate tak padhai kar pate hai
 After that their studies and skills did not match their jobs
 nirmaan, seva-satkar, or saarvajanik sevaaon se jude kshetra badi sankhya main rojgaar to paidaa karenge lekin ham un rojgaron ke liye logon ko kushal nahin bana rahe (yaa saamaajik samanta paidaa nahin kar rahe)
 And, in the end, our policies often take the easy path, not in the positive direction of development
 haal main jaaton, marathaon, patidaaron or kapuon ke andolan hue jo kabhi sampann or rajnatik rup se prabhaavshaalee tabake rahe hai
 They are concerned about the educated youth of their communities as government jobs are 'reserved' and private jobs are few
 unke liye saarvajanik naukariyon kii ummid khadi karnaa ek samaadhaan ho saktaa he lekin unhen acchhee naukariyaan yaa rojgaar chahie, chaahe krishi main hon yaa phir shaharon main
 Big changes will be needed to make agriculture profitable: technological investment, extensive land use (not land ownership), changes in crops and the end of the dominance of powerful middlemen over yield prices
 in saare sakht vikalpon ke liye rajnatik ichhashakti chahie
 But our leaders see the simplest solution to the waiver of agricultural loans
 isi tarah bhartiya mahilaon ke maamle main avasar behad kam hai
 The 900-to-male ratio and only 27 percent of working women (except for West Asia, the lowest level in the whole world) shows how little space there is for Indian women
 jis desh main lakhon kii sankhya main doctoron, shikshakon, pulicekarmiyon or udhyamiyon kii jarurat he vahaan to yah itani badi sankhya main mahilaon kii pratibha ko ganvaa dene jaisaa he
 Similarly, for the sake of security, being imprisoned indoors is enveloping the urban youth
 21veen sadi main bhi antarjaateey yaa antardharmik vivaahon ko jagah nahin mil rahi he or niraapad prem ko nafrat kii phija main jehad bataa diya jaataa he
 Finally, access to civil services remains limited
 aapurti kii khaasi tangi vaale teen kshetron (shiksha, swasthya or awaasan) kaa bharat kii kor mudrasphiti main 37 fisadi yogadan he jo bharat ko is myne main anoothaa banaata he ki uski rajkoshiya niti hi uski maudrik niti ko bhi tay karti he
 Its historical solution has been a two-tier market
 sampann or taqatvar varg nijee bazaar tak pahunch rakhata rahaa he yaa phir use saarvajanik sampatti kii variyata par uplabdhta rahi he
 The poor either have to pay more or they have to tolerate the difference in service
 skool main admician se lekar aspataal main bistar tak ke liye unhen dar-dar kii khaak chanani padati he
 But this will not be able to go forward
 hamaari rajnatik karypranali ko aadhik paardarshee bananaa hoga
 The mantra of reform democracy from top to bottom
 Two factors can be helpful
 ekadam nichle str tak loktantr kaa vistaar ho or rajkaaj kaa najariya badale
 Political parties have started experimenting with new business models to win elections
 isamen logon se sidhaa samvaad, sthaneey ilaakon ke anuroop sandesh taiyaar karnaa, or voting boothon kaa prabandhan pramukh he, taaki aakhri sire tak matadaataaon tak pahunch banaai ja sake
 Soon, smart voters will expect results
 jaagruk matadaata technology or apekshaaon ke jariye nitiyon or puunji aavantit karne ke liye pasand-naapsand kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Democracy coming from the bottom can finally break the pattern of leaders imposed from above
 2018 main kai rajyon ke chunaav hone vaale hai or inamen ham yuvaaon ko ummidavaaron or partiyon ke saamne zyada apekshaayen rakhte dekh sakate hai
 Political leaders are necessary but not sufficient
 bharat ko sakriy, unnat naagarik sansthaanon kii jarurat he jo samaaj ke sangrakshak ban saken, vyavsaay or rajya ke bich eemaandaar bicheliyon kii bhoomika nibhaa saken or yah aashwast kar saken ki log apni jimmedaariyon or adhikaron ke bare main sachet rahen
 2018 is a good year to start such an initiative, because this time there are millions of first time voters
 bhartiya log amiron se ghrinaa nahin karte
 Of course, becoming rich is often part of their dreams
 lekin ve is baat ko mahasoos karnaa nahin chaahate ki amiron or rajnatik netaaon ne (inamen amuman mileebhagat rahati he) unke khel main farjivada kar diya he
 They want to make sure that their children also have opportunities to succeed
 tarakkee ke avasaron kii uplabdhta main gaiyr-barabari hi bharat ke vikaas kii kahani ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he
 Skilled leaders will try to assure that this game is played honestly
 varanaa bharat kii vikaas kahani vakt se pehle hi khatm ho sakati he

 Only a soldier should be asked where he is going
 yuddh kaa unmaad failaane vaale or rachane waalon se is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin milegaa
 We know about a soldier only when he is attained to martyrdom
 yuddh kii anivaaryta or yuddh kii vyarthta duniya bhar main bahes kaa mudda he lekin ek sipaahi apni line of duty kabhi cross nahin karata he
 He can't even run away from there

 He does not read the book

 People from the metros are getting emotional on TV and Twitter, but i get emotional watching those who leave their homes from Monday to Tuesday, attending the last visits of martyrs from all places
 ek choti si salaami in logon ke liye bhi banati he jo kisi mantri ke aane kaa intazaar nahin karte balki gaanv yaa kasbe main shahid ke ghar kii taraf chal nikalate hai
 Somewhere they come out with candles, somewhere district officials start leading the rally, and somewhere school children start following the procession
 inamen se ho saktaa he ki koi twitor par deshbhakti ke falsafe na jhaad rahaa ho lekin ye wo log hai jinhone shahid ke parthiv sharir kaa ghanton intazaar kiya hoga
 When a young man becomes a soldier, he becomes lonely, but when he comes to work for the country, then on his last journey, those people also come who would never even know about that soldier
 ham kahaan parvaah karte hai ki hamaara sipaahi general bogi yaa duusare darje main thel thel kar jagah paata hua ghar lautataa he

 "cinema ke liye lekhan main us daur kaa pratibimb tha or log bahut jaagruk na the

 The creation of such a national song, when the song was composed by Bankim Chandra, the British rulers dominated India

 kabhi-kabhaar thode samay ke liye janata ke bich najar aane vaale or phir rahasyamay dhang se lambey samay ke liye antadhryaan ho jane valerahul gandhiakhirkaar puri tarah se saarvajanik jivan main kud pade hai
 But it is so clear that all this happened in no hurry
 sonia gandhi idhar ek arase se bich-bich main aswasth chal rahi thim
 The family faced embarrassment after their son-in-law, Robert Vadra, was accused of corruption
 2012 main uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav main rahul kii chamak feeki pad gai kyonki chunaav prachaar main puraa jor lagane ke baavjood ve party ko 403 main se sirf 28 siten hi dilava paae
 In 2007, the party won 22 seats
 yani pichhali baar se mahaj 6 zyada
 The Congress-led UPA-2 is going through its toughest exam as it is constantly facing allegations of corruption and misrule
 ab agle aam chunaavon ke liye sirf 14 maheene hi rah gaye hai
 In such a situation, Rahul had to come out from behind the scenes
 iske sivaa or koi vikalp bhi to nahin tha
 The question of "who will lead the Congress in the next general election" was sought
 party main sonia ke baad number do maane jane vaale congress ke upaadhyaksh kaa pad sweekaar karne ke baad rahul ke upar bahut baari jimmedaari aa gai he
 When the Congress Working Committee (CWC) approved his name for the post of vice president on January 19, senior party leaders hugged Rahul and congratulated him warmly
 in netaaon main pradhanmantri manmohan singh, vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram and Defense Minister A
 ke
 Antony was also involved
 uljhe bal or betaratib dadhi rakhe rahul party ke 10 mahasachivon main se ek ke sthaan se uthakar sidhe number do kii jagah pahunch gaye the
 However, he might have introspected something overnight and his mother warned him passionately that power was like a poison
 rahul ne nam ankhon vaale congressi netaaon ko yah baat bataai bhi, jo 20 janvari ko jaipur ke birla auditorium main jamaa the
 He was reading his speech in his hands for pages of paper
 unke bhaashan main jahaan party ke puraane netaaon ko khush karne kii koshish kii gai thi, vahiin baichaiyn yuva varg or niraash madhya varg ke liye ummid kii kiran pesh karne kii koshish kii gai thi
 He also mentioned his personal memories while keeping his heart open in front of the party
 unhone indira gandhi kii hatya par apane divangat pita rajeev gandhi kii pratikriya ke bare main bhi bataaya
 Recalling the incident at the age of 14, Rahul said, "I feel so sad, as never before
" maine apane jivan main pehali baar apane pita ko rote hue dekha tha
 He was the bravest man in my eyes, then i saw him crying
 maine dekha ki ve tut chuke the
 "it is believed that his father did not want to enter politics just like him
 rahul ne bataaya ki “andar se tuutane ke baavjood, unke pita ne” logon ko “ummid kii kiran” dikhaai
 This was enough to infuse power into the party
 rahul ne apane bhaashan main bataaya ki “party hi ab unki jindagi he
 The whole hall stood up
 yahaan tak ki manch par baithe party ke varisht netaa bhi
 To embrace his new vice president, he kept the line as it was
 party mahasachiv janardan dvivedi to itane bhavuk ho gaye ki ve rahul ke kandhe par sir rakhkar rone hi lage, aakhirkaar rahul ne unhen aansu ponchney ke liye apana roomaal thama diya
 Once the Gandhi family dominance is established over the party, Rahul will now have to prepare plans to fulfill his promises
 puraane netaaon ne unke bhaashan par taaliyaan bajaain or ve bhavuk hokar roe bhi lekin rahul ne jab yah kaha ki ve kaam karke dikhaaen varanaa unhen baahar kaa rasta dekhnaa hoga to andar-hi-andar unhen dhakka bhi laga hoga
 There has been speculation as to whether some senior leaders are about to be ousted and who will be in Rahul's team? Digvijay Singh, party general secretary considered close to Rahul, says the new vice president raised important issues at the Jaipur camp
 unke shabdon main, “log dekhenge ki ve sanghathan ke punargathan, shashan or kshetreey netritv ke vikaas par kis tarah kaam karte hai
 "when asked if Rahul is ready to withstand the pressure of Lok Sabha elections?" At this he smiled a little and said, "after all, pressure only enhances a man
" ”rahul ne 23 janvari ko rajdhani ke 24, akbar road par party ke mukhyalay main jab aupchaarik rup se upaadhyaksh kaa pad grahan kiya, to unhone apni bhavi yojanaon ke bare main kisi bhi tarah kaa sanket nahin diya
 There was a crowd of youthful cadre activists of Congress and a youth brigade shouting slogans
 us shorgul bhari bheed main jute log sirf rahul ke gaal main gadde uker dene vaali muskaan hi dekh paa rahe the or itnaa hi sun paae ki ve nakaaratmak raajnneeti main yakeen nahin karte hai
 Rahul will have to formulate his own plan and share the responsibilities between his mother and himself
 unhen ubhartee nai peedi or congress ke puraane netaaon ke bich ek pul kii tarah kaam karnaa hoga
 He may have told that his party works behind closed doors, but his mother has no choice but to depend on Ahmed Patel, an expert in secretive politics and Motilal Vora, who holds the treasure key
 
 yuva saansadon ne, jinamein se kai ab mantri hai, dilli gang rape ke virodh pradarshnon ke dauraan khulkar hissaa nahin liya
 These people will have to give more time among the public because their generation has estimated the power of the common man
 jaipur ke chintan shivi main rahul kii padonnati ke sivaa or kuch hasil nahin aayaa
 The Jaipur Declaration did not take into account the challenges of the year before the election
 rahul jin muddon par bole, unamem se kisi kaa bhi ullekh nahin hua
 For now it is assumed that Rahul knows where there is a mess in the party
 unhen is gadabadi kaa ilaaj karnaa hoga

 kartiki bhatnagar kii umr tab sirf saat varsh thi, jab unhone apni skin ke rang main badlaav mahasoos kiya, unki skin kaa rang chakaton main safed hone laga tha
 This series started with a stain on the mouth, reaching other parts of the body, legs, hands, stomach and knees
 kartiki ke sahpaathee unase dur hone lage hai
 Nobody wants to play with them
 dost chidhaane lage or vitiligo ke chalate unka majaak banaate
 Vitiligo is a skin disease
 vishwa bhar main 7 karod log vitiligo naam kii beemaari se peedit hai
 It is caused by the lack of melanin in the body, which gives color to the skin
 melanin kii kami hone se vyakti kii skin rang badalane lagati he
 Karthiki's friend Shreyas Kishore said that all kinds of medicines were used for treatment, but to no avail
 thak harkar ant main kartiki ne is beemaari se ladane kaa iraadaa chhod diya
 Accepted the changing color of her skin
 isse unhen maansik taur par majbootee mili
 When the high school student Shreyas came to know about Karthiki's vitiligo disease, he jumped with joy
 shreyas ne kaha, 'meraa pehali pratikriya thi, vaah, mujhe tumhaari dohare rang kii skin kaaphi pasand he
 i found it beautiful
 kartiki ko laga ki yaa to main pagal hum yaa wo
 Shreyas later told Kartiki that instead of the skin on his feet, the shape of the skin is similar to the logo of the Apple company
 bahut inkaar ke baad kartiki ne ise sweekaar kiya or phir unhone ise dekhne kaa apana najariya hi badal diya
 Karthiki started painting on his body
 sharir par bane safed chakaton ko creative cartoon se dhak diya
 Karthiki's body sinks in colors
 creative cartoon or chitrakaari se kartiki kii skin ek alag rangath main aakarshak najar aane lagi
 Hearts on his body, cute ghosts, screaming men and mountains were seen
 apni sakaaraatmakataa ke chalate kartiki ne vitiligo par vijay hasil kar lee, jis beemaari ke chalate kartiki ko pareshaan hona padaa
 That is a matter of pride for Karthiki
 apane sharir par pasri kala kartiki ke liye behad khaas he
 Vitiligo is no longer contagious nor harmful due to positivity, creativity and a little awareness
 sakaaratmak soch ke dam par duniya bhar main 50 million vitiligo se peedit logon ke jivan main badlaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 Karthicki has now started the Instagram campaign # barethemidriff, which focuses on the positivity of the body, based on Vitiligo
 creative tareeke se vyakti apni beemaari par jeet hasil kar saktaa he
 Even if it does not meet the perceived standards of our society
 kya he vitiligo kii beemaaribharat main har saal vitiligo ke 10 lakh maamle saamne aate hai
 In this, a person's skin starts changing its color
 yah aamtaur safed dhabbon kii tarah dikhataa he
 The skin starts to turn white except for its normal color
 isamen ilaaj se madad to milti he, lekin yah puri tarah thik nahin ho saktaa
 It can last a lifetime
 vitiligo ke cese main sharir kii koshikaayen marane lagati hai yaa kaam karnaa band kar detii hai
 It can occur in any part of the body
 munh, bal or ankhon ke saath guptangon par bhi ho saktaa he
 Its emergence is more visible in a dark person
 ilaaj se sthiti sudhar sakati he, lekin yah puri tarah thik nahin ho sakati

 In fact, the government is considering the option of reducing the Employees' Provident Fund (PF) contribution and increasing the take home portion, and a provision has been made in the Social Security Bill
 philhal karmchaariyon ke basic selary kaa 12 fisadi hissaa pief ke rup main kaata jaataa he
 Similarly, the amount of 12% of basic salary from the employer is also deposited in EPFO, but 8 of this amount
 33 fisadi ipies yani karmchaaree pension yojana main chalaa jaataa he
 Now the Social Security Bill, 2019 proposes to reduce the staff share and it has been approved by the Cabinet
 yah bill isi hafte sansad main pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 What will happen? One of the rationale behind the reduction in beneficial contribution is that giving more take home salary means that people will have more money and thus consumption will increase
 haalanki bill ke mutabik employr yani niyokta vaale pief hisse main koi badlaav nahin kiya jayega
 Similarly, the bill states that fixed term contract workers will also be eligible to receive gratuity on pro rata basis
 abhi ke niyam ke mutabik jo karmchaaree kisi company-sanghathan main paanch saal tak naukari karte hai, ve hi gracuty hasil karne ke adhikari hote hai
 Apart from offering several other changes, the Ministry of Labor is also withdrawing its proposal which said that people associated with EPFO should be given the option to adopt the National Pension System (NPS)
 mantralay kaa kahana he ki abhi kii vyavastha main zyada ritern mil rahaa he or kai anya phaayde mil rahe hai
 Apart from this, the Ministry of Labor has also rejected the proposal that EPFO and ESIC should be run as a corporate company

 (these figures are before 2019 World Cup) kitaab kaa naam-beeing salamanalekhak-jasim khanprakaashak-penguuin grupakimat-599 rupee (hard cover)1)salmaan khan apni nijee jindagi ko lekar kabhi khulkar baat nahin karte
 Talk of Sangeeta Bijlani or relationship between Somi Ali and love dispute
 aishwarya raay se algaav kii ho yaa katrina caff se alag hone ke baad bikharaav kii
 Salman's only answer is that he does not want to interfere in the happy life of the person by remembering the past
 yani bhaawanaaon ko samajhane vaala ek samvedanshli insaan
 But the next moment Salman is accused of being strict with his lady love
 aarope yah bhi hai ki salmaan ne kai maukon par apni premicaon se marpet bhi kii he
 That is, both things are completely opposite from each other
 2)salmaan khan ko jaanane vaale maanate hai ki vah dosti main kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 The same applies to enmity with them
 salmaan or shahrukh ke bich dosti ke baad takaraar kaa ab ant ho chukaa he
 Salman himself says, 'everything has expiry
 ' saal 2008 main katrina kii berthde party main shahrukh se takaraav ke baad jis salmaan ne bayaan diya tha ki vah or shahrukh ab kabhi dost nahin ho sakate
 Salman and Shah Rukh now see friendship and brotherhood on the lines of karan-arjun
 lekin inhen salmaan ne vivek obray ko abhi tak maafee nahin di he or obray kii ore se saarvajanik taur par maafee maangane ke baad bhi unhen andekha kiya
 It can be said that in personal life, we almost see two Salman on every front
 reel life se itar real life main bada sawaal yahi he ki salmaan agar aise hai to aise kyon hai? patrkaar se lekhak bane jasim khan kii pehali kitaab 'beeing salmaan' isi ek sawaal par kendrit he
 There is a common understanding that the understanding and personality of a person is due to his environment and the people around him
 jasim isi sutara ko dhyaan main rakhkar apni yatra shuru karte hai
 In the beginning of the book itself, he also clarifies that this is not a biography
 balki hameshaa vivaadon se jude rahane vaale bollywood ke 'sultan' ke bare main yah jaanane kii koshish kii he ki vah jaise hai, vaise kyon hai? kaise ek hi insaan bollywood kaa 'bed bvoy' bhi he or vahi sabakaa 'bhaijan' bhi
 To find the answer, he says that he did research for three years to find the answer to this one question
 salmaan ke pita saleem khan se lekar indore main unke chachaa naeem khan, salmaan ke bachapan ke doston, chachere bhai, chachee sabase mulaakaat kii
 Salman's new-to-old interviews, news reports about him, people connected with the lawsuits on him, and even the pages of history that ran and narrated the story of Salman's ancestors from Afghanistan to India
 gahan shodh, khub saare logon se mulaakaat or salmaan ke bare main har sachai or afvaah kii padtaal ke baad jasim kareeb 200 pannon main 'beeing salmaan' lekar aae hai
 But in spite of mindful exercise for 26,280 hours of three years i
e
 about 1095 days, his book proves to be at least superficial if not a failure on many fronts
 darasal, salmaan kii prasiddhi unki kitaab kaa sabase kamjor pahalu bhi he or sabase majboot bhi
 What is the problem, where did the defaults Salman Khan become one of the most searched personality on Google in 2015
 beete 27 varshon se unke der subah jagane se lekar der raat yaa yah kahen tadake sone tak kii har baat charchaa main rahati he
 Salman turns 50 on 27 December 2015
 yani unki jindagi ke 18,250 se adhik dinon ke 4 lakh 38 hajaar ghanton main se ek bade hisse kii baangi ham akhbaar, patrikaon, tivi, website or ab soshal media ke jariye kisi na kisi rup main jaanate hai
 Author Jasim Khan has also made them the basis for the research of his book to a large extent
 aise main salmaan ke purvajon or indore main unke schuli dinon ko chhod den to adhiktar baaten bataur salmaan ke prashansakon ko pehle se pataa hai
 While this book is also of real importance to them
 kitaab main nayaa kya hajaseem is myne main prashansa ke paatr hai ki unhone salmaan ke purvajon ko lekar jin jaankariyon kaa kitaab main samavesh kiya he, vah gahan shodh or kadi mehnat se hi sambhav he
 Especially the story of Salman's grandfather Abdul Rashid Khan and his grandfather Abdul Latif Khan's family coming to India from af-pak region
 parivaar kii teen pidiyon kaa sena main bhartee hona
 Shehzadi Begum's Diary
 yah sab salmaan se aage unke parivaar or purvajon ko jaanane main hamaari madad karte hai
 a lot of stories such as Salman's childhood mischief in the book, a visit to mango orchards with brothers and friends in Indore, a tractor trip and a body building trick overlooking his uncle keep the freshness of the book
 kitaab main pita saleem khan kii salmaan ko lekar soch, khaskar salmaan ke prem-sambandhon par saleem khan tippanee or raay nayaapan liye hue he
 Salman's entry into the industry, his first meeting with Sooraj Barjatya, the role in 'maine Pyaar Kiya' and the story of Struggle before that, is worth reading
 jasim ne apni kitaab main salmaan ke bachapan or unke parivaar se judi kai tasveeron ko bhi shaamil kiya, jo sahejane laayak he
 However, it would have been nice if these pictures would have been published on glossy paper instead of ordinary paper
 salmaan kii jindagi or vah hotelkitab main bandra bandstand par us jamaane main sthit si-rock hotel kii bhi charchaa he
 This is the same hotel where Salman met Sangeeta Bijlani and Somi Ali
 kuch rishte bane to kuch toote
 Mohnish Behl became Salman's friend in the same hotel gym
 yah vah daur tha jab salmaan parivaar se chhipakar gym kiya karte the
 Salman also met his brother-in-law Atul Agnihotri in this hotel
 yahaan khalati he kamikisse, kahaniyon se itar lekhak jis sawaal kaa jawaab dhundhane ke liye syaahi kharch karte hai, vahaan yah kitaab halki sabit hoti he
 Because the issues and questions related to Salman which his fans want to know, the writer has shown a little haste in his investigation
 masalan, kitaab khabaron or intervyuuj ke jariye salmaan ke tuutate rishton kii kahani to bataati he, lekin aisa kyon hua, aisa hone ke peeche kya paristhitiyaan raheen, isaki koi charchaa kitaab main nahin he
 Similarly, we also get as much information as the reader about the controversies related to Salman, as far as we have come to know through the news
 salmaan ke dada, pardada or pardada ke bhi pita ke bare main lekhak ne tasalli se zikr kiya he, lekin salmaan ke pita saleem khan kii jindagi ke bare main vah utani baariki se tathy nahin rakhte hai
 The two biggest aspects of Salim Khan's life - first wife and Salman's mother Sushila Charak meeting and love with second wife Helen and then the discussion of marriage is reduced to one to two lines
 nahin kii gai salmaan se sidhi batyah kitaab salmaan ko samajhane ke liye likhi gai he, lekin dukhad he ki kitaab ke liye salmaan se hi sidhe taur par baat nahin ho saki
 For example, whatever information the author gives us about Salman is based on news related to father and sister Salim Khan, uncle Naeem Khan, aunt Sufia Khan, cousins, brother-in-law Atul Agnihotri, Mohnish Bahl and news related to the actor
 kyon padhebgar salmaan ke fain hai yaa unako pasand karte hai to yah kitaab ek baar padhane laayak jarur he
 This book is for you if you want to read Salman related news, controversies without searching once
 salmaan ke bachapan, indore main schuli dinon, mumbai main hai skool or college ke dinon ke kuch rochak kisson ke bare main jaananaa chaahate hai to yah kitaab aapke liye he
 Why not read? If you want to read this thinking that this book is not for you if you know about any of the most concerning matters related to Salman's personal life

 mantralay ne kaha ki ipel 6 ke sabhi maichon kii jaanch kii jarurat nahin he
 In fact, Sharad Pawar on Wednesday demanded that the Home Ministry should investigate all the 75 matches of this season of IPL
 pavaar ne kaha tha ki vartmaan prakaran ke kaaran khel or board kii saakh prabhavit hui he
 Supporting the suggestion of former Board President Shashank Manohar to investigate the IPL matches played in this session to the government, Pawar had said, "if the BCCI gives in writing to the Home Ministry and urges the government to investigate all the matches, then all the matches Can check vah kisi se bhi poochtacha kar sakati he
 He has legal approval
 yahi vajah he ki manohar ne upyogi or prabhavi suzav diya or board ko ise sweekaar karnaa chahie
 Meanwhile, Union Home Secretary RK Singh said, "we have not yet received a request from the BCCI or other concerned parties to investigate the IPL cases

 ' The Reserve Bank of India did not change policy interest rates on Wednesday
 uske is rukh par sarkaar kuch khafa najar ai or uske adhikariyon ne kaha ki maujuuda aarthik halaat main byaaj daron main badi narmi karne kaa is samay acha mauka tha
 Despite not reducing the policy interest rate, the Reserve Bank has reduced the provision of risk for some categories of home loans, which has led to the expectation of housing loans ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 75 lakh
 rigerv bank ne esaelaar ke praavdhaan ko bhi kam kiya he, jisase bainkon ko sarkari pratibhutiyon main paisa kam rakhana padegaa or unke paas karj ke liye adhik dhan uplabdh rahegaa
 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel, did not make any changes in key policy rates, citing the risk of inflation rising due to farm debt waiver of states in the bi-monthly monetary policy review

 1 in the year 2017-18 according to the Times of India
 75 lakh se zyada antity (log, companiyaan, sansthaaen aadi) ne saal main 1 karod rupee se zyada rakam nikaali he
 Some of it is right in a lawful manner, and some are also wrong
 aisi kuch nikasi ATM manage karne vaali companiyon, kaarobaariyon aadi kii vaid dhan hoti hai, jabaki bahut se udhaaharan galat logon dwaara nikaale gaye dhan ke bhi hai
