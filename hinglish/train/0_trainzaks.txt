 jis telegram seva ke istemaal se angrejon ne apane vyaper ko badhaayaa or bharatiyon ne apano tak sandesh bheje, wo telegram seva ab hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye itihaas ban gai he
 BSNL decided to discontinue this service citing economic constraints and staff shortage as the reason

 Staff shortage is different

 Therefore, no party worker or official will contest the elections independently

 During this time, the BSP also targeted the BJP and the media fiercely
 party ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi nikaay chunaav kaa maahaul kharaab kar rahi he
 At the same time a section of the media is denying the existence of BSP and alleging that Mayawati is promoting nepotism in her party
 party kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya ki bispi puri tarah se ambedkarwaadi soch kii party he
 The Samajwadi Party and the Congress Party are not the family party and will not be so

 congress party ne himachal main 68 main se apni haari hui 10 seat or gujarat main 182 main se haari hui 25 seat bhi dene ko taiyaar nahin hui
 This attitude of the Congress reflects its destiny for the alliance

 So it has become very important to stop it

 com / atyxyht2sy— Tennis TV (@tennistv)august 13, 2017 Madhubani, bordering Nepal, is a mosque for its finest sarees and paintings, but now it is becoming a safe way for terrorists to sneak into India
 nepal se 45 kimi dur sthit madhubani jila aatankwaadiyon ke liye bhartee ke nae centre or chhipane ke adde ke taur par bhi ubhara he
 Since 2006, police have arrested six terrorists agents from Madhubani alone
 november ke aakhir se lekar disambar kii shuruyaat tak do saptaah tak chale ek oparation main dilli police ne yahaan se indian mujahidin (iem) ke teen or sandigdh karindon ko pakadaa he
 It is alleged that these people are part of the 13-member IM module that conspired and executed the blasts at the German Bakery in Pune in February 2010 and the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore in April 2010 and the Jama Masjid in September 2010 
 aisa mana jaataa he ki is modul ke leader riyaj bhatkal or ikbaal bhatkal hai
 Both these brothers raised the Indian Mujahideen and both are absconding
 unhone hi in hamalon kii sajeesh rachi or sthaneey logon kii madad se use anjaam diya tha
 The blasts at a German bakery left 17 dead and 15 injured in an explosion outside the stadium in Bangalore
 19 sitambar ko, dilli main kaamanwealth khelon ke shuru hone se thik pehle jama masjid par hui golibari main do taiwani paryatak ghayal hue the
 Madhubani district, with a population of more than 41 lakhs, is facing notoriety of being 'another Azamgarh'
 purvi uttar pradesh ke azamgarh jile ne kai aatankwaadi hamalon ke liye jimmedaar indian mujahidin ke kam-se-kam 13 karinde bheje the
 These attacks also included the 2008 Delhi serial blasts in which more than two dozen people were killed
 dilli police ne 6 disambar ko madhubani se 140 kimi dur bihar ke purniya jile se faruk urf nawab urf aftab alam ko kathith taur par chinnaswami stadium main bam rakhane ke aarope main giraftaar kiya tha
 Farooq, who used to run a small grocery shop to show the world, is im's alleged seventh survivor arrested by Delhi Police
 22 november ko rajdhani ke anand vihaar bas adde se dilli police ne indian mujahidin ke pehle karinde katil siddiki ko giraftaar kiya
 In the subsequent events, all these arrests became increasingly rapid
 bihar police ke saath talmail se kaam kar rahi dilli police ne 24 november ko 21 saal ke chaatr or majahabi talim dene vaale gayur ahamed or ek 28 saal ke pakistani naagarik mohammad ajmal urf shoeb ko madhubani ke alag-alag ilaakon se daboch liya
 Local Muslims were angered by the arrest of Gayoor, a poor, but distinguished family of Pachhiya Tola of Sakri in Madhubani
 ve use bekasoor maanate hai
 Ajmal lived as a shopkeeper of woolen clothes and had rented a room at Signia Chowk, 15 km from Sakari, in September this year
 cameraa lene ke baad do maheene ke bheetar hi uski maujuudagi sabaki najar main aa gai thi
 His perplexed landlord Mohammad Nasir claims that his old mother rented him a room on the basis of trust
 nasir kaa kahana he, ''vah sirf raat main ghar lautataa tha
 We met him very rarely
 kabhi-kabhaar anjaan log usase milane aate the
 He spoke to neighbors only once when he sacrificed a goat on the Eidzuha
 ''ajmal or gayur indian mujahidin ke un chah sandigdhon main se hai, jinhen 5 disambar ko 10 din ke liye dilli police kii hiraasat main saunpa gaya he
 They are accused of firing Jama Masjid and carrying out various terrorist acts including Pune and Bangalore
 haalanki indian mujahidin se judane vaali kadiyon kii chaanbin kar rahe dilli police ke adhikariyon ne donon se baraamad chizon ke bare main bataane se inkaar kar diya, lekin india today ko pataa chalaa he ki ajmal ke kabje se 635 dollar, paanch bhartiya or nepali sim card tathaa teen mobile phone baraamad hue hai
 While the police claim that they have found 'convincing' evidence from the phone records, the recovered items do not match the description given by Ajmal
 police ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik, ajmal ne jile ke lalganj ilaake main jis mahila se shaadi kii thi, vah usase hue teen bacchon kaa pita he
 The police also say that Ajmal was languishing in Madhubani after a string of terror attacks
 usne kiraye par cameraa is vajah se liya tha jisase uske parivaar ko pataa na chal sake ki vah kya kar rahaa he
 Gayur went to the police upon being summoned, but Ajmal did all the tricks to get the body released
 ek aalaa police adhikari ke mutabik, ''usne kaha ki vah jaipur kaa rahane vaala bhartiya he, lekin dilli police ke paas uske khilaaf saboot the
 "the entire operation was carried out by the Delhi Police and the role of Bihar Police was only to help him during the raid
" bihar ke ek varisht ipies adhikari kaa kahana he ki ve yah nahin samaj sake ki dilli police ne ajmal ke bhartiya sasuraal waalon se poochtacha na karne kaa faisla kyon kiya
 Why did Madhubani district become the base of terrorists? a senior police officer in Darbhanga admitted that the police of the area slept in the name of their work, especially because there is minimal extremism within the district
 ve kehete hai, ''yah chhipane ke lihaaj se ekadam makul jagah he
 Nobody will see you here for a long time
 ''jile main aatankwaadiyon se link kaa ek or pahalu he is jile kaa nepal ke paas sthit hona
 Though Bihar's 625 km long border with Nepal is mostly open, but due to long standing cultural ties with the neighboring country of this district, this border is fully open
 ek varisht police adhikari kehete hai, ''hindu or muslim donon samudaayon ke seemaa paar vaivaahik sambandh hai
 Even the property is shared
 '' isse bhi badtar yah he ki nepal se aane waalon kii koi jaanch-padtaal nahin hoti
 This provides an easy way for terrorists from across the border to enter India
 ek varisht ipies adhikari kehete hai, ''bharat nepal se aane vaale pakistaniyon ke bare main jaankaree le saktaa he or is baat kii apane str par jaanch kar saktaa he ki kya unamem se koi bina jaruri kagajaat ke bharat main daakhil ho rahaa he
 The level of coordination between the officials of Bihar and Nepal needs to be greatly improved
 ''ek pakistani naagarik kii haal hi main hui giraftaar ise pakkaa karti he
 On November 30, hameed-ur-rehman was arrested for illegally entering Nepal from the Madhubani court premises
 vah farji passport ke aadhaar par pichley saal bharat aane ke aaropee apane bete mukhtaar se milane aayaa tha
 Mukhtar is in judicial custody
 indian mujahidin ke karindon kii giraftaar se aatankwaad virdohi karrwai ko bal mila he
 But the plot of terror is still unresolved
 agar gayur chahta to faraar ho saktaa tha
 His father and homeopath Mohammad Nasrullah Jamal in Sakri had known for more than a week that the police were looking for his son
 24 november ko jamaal ne padosi ke yahaan se apane bete ko phone karke bataaya ki police intjaar kar rahi he
 Gayur himself walked and sat in a police jeep parked in front of his house in Pachhiya Tola area
 uske mata-pita jor dekar kehete hai ki darbhanga ke ahmadiya shefia madrase se fajil kii padhai karne vaala gayur madhubani or darbhanga jilon se kabhi baahar niklaa hi nahin
 After the police action in North Bihar, many questions have not been answered
 masalan, police ne gayur ke ghar kii talaashi kyon nahin lee?gutthi kholane main mili kamyaabi ek str par dilasa detii he
 But this also raises a painful question - how many terrorists have entered Indian territory from Nepal's open border? uttar pradesh or bihar kii 5 siton par upachunaav ke baad aaj nattejey kii ghadi he
 Voting was held in these 5 seats on 11 March and the counting of votes continues from 8 am today

 Referring to the statement of Justice AK Patnaik, who is supervising the CVC investigation against Alok Verma, CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury told NDTV that the CVC should be removed
 yechuri ne kaha "mujhe lag rahaa he ki sivisi ko ab hataanaa chahie kyonki unhone puure maamle ko sarkaar ke hisaab se tay kiya
 It is not proper for him to continue in the post of CVC
 sivisi ko pehle hataaya janaa chahie or phir un par karrwai honi chahie, ki kya rahaa unka role is puure cese main

 The terrorists sitting in Pakistan use codewords during terrorist missions
 ji haa, wo jumale jiske madad se aatank ke aakaa apane rangaruton ke saath napak sajishon kaa blue print bhi taiyaar kar lete hai
 Even if someone listens to their conversation, they cannot understand
 kyonki unke code ko dicode karnaa mushkil hi nahin naammumkin he
 The business of terror runs from codeword
 ajtak ke paas maujuud ek clip main pakistan main baithelshkar commanderne lashkar ke rangarut ko dilli tak phone mila diya
 Lashkar's rookie was present in Pragati Maidan
 aatank ke kaale kaarobaar main iske aakaaon ne ek puri dictionari bana rakhi he
 Who cannot understand us and ordinary people like you
 aatank kii duniya main suut mil gaya kaa matlab hota he ki kya reki kii tasviren mil gayi
 Send mango means send weapons
 america ladki kaa matlab hota he, IED visphotak
 Dana means weapon
 aalu kaa matlab hota he grenade
 Rajma means cartridge
 aatank kii bhashaa main chota maal kaa matlab hua pistaul or bada maal hua asolt rifl
 In the same way, terrorists use read and written to talk to their recruits, which means terror training
 amaanat uthaa lenaa kaa matlab hota he jaao hathiyaar le lo
 Paper work means money through hawala
 is tarah kodeward main baat karte hue aatanki vaardaat ko anjaam dete hai
 Sitting in Pakistan, the boss of terror not only gives instructions to the terrorists, but also recognizes and recruits the recruits of terror through phone and email
 is kaarobaar main mobile phone ek bada hathiyaar ban gaya he
 From plotting terror to carrying out nefarious attacks, the work is done on the phone
 aatank kaa sardaar apane rangaruton kii pahchaan bhi phone par hi karata he
 Poison also fills their minds
 aatank kaa khel ab hitech ho gaya he
 From mobile and SIM to email ID
 wo bhi aakaaon ko ji mail kaa adress chahie
 But one thing is certain that the terrorists do not put their recruits in a mission of terror until they are fully satisfied
 jab rangaruton ko aatank ke mishan main laga diya jaataa he to aakaa un par puri najar rakhte hai, chaahe ve ghati main hon yaa phir dilli main
 In a clip present with Aaj Tak, the sit-ins commander in Pakistan got a call from Lashkar to Delhi
 lashkar kaa rangarut pragati maidan main maujuud tha
 His conversation clearly showed that he was engaged in some special work
 haalanki aatank ke aakaaon or aatankiyon ke bich kii ye baatcheet thodi puraani he, lekin aaj bhi style yahi he
 Mobile is being used indiscriminately in the game of terror

 The latest case is Bhikaji Cama Placeflyoverka on the Ring Road, where a major crack has occurred on the flyover from AIIMS to Dhaulakuna
 haalanki ganimat he ki ye daraar sadak par nahin jisase yatayaat par asar nahin pad rahaa, lekin fliover ke neeche se nikalne vaale yatayaat or logon ke liye ye daraar bada khatra sabit ho sakati he
 Let us tell you that the underground metro is working right next to this flyover and it is being speculated that this crack may have occurred due to that
 philhal metro ne daraar vaale hisse ko lohe ke anglon se sahaara de rakhaa he, taaki cement kii diwaar kaa ye hissaa neeche sadak par naa gire
 In this case, PWD is being questioned because this department of Delhi Government commends itself for saving money in the construction of flyovers, but it should not be forgotten that its job is not only to build flyovers but also to maintain them
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the attention of the government engaged in the election preparations of other states outside Delhi is also towards that Delhi

 Kohli, who led India to the World Cup in Kuala Lumpur in under-19 cricket, told India Today Deputy Editor Shantanu Guha Ray from Mirpur (bangladesh) and later from his home in Delhi that whenever he goes to bat, Their innings are divided into three parts of 30, 60 and 100
 is tarah ve yaa to ardhshtak bana lete hai yaa phir shatak tak pahunch jate hai
 Also that the rank of vice-captain is more than life for him
 aapke donon shatak bekaar chale gaye kyonki bharat final main nahin pahunch sakaa
 See, don't try to make too much sense from the defeats in England, Australia and Dhaka
 bura vakt rahaa he to kuch achche, yaadgaar lamhe bhi aae hai
 We have played a lot of cricket in the last one year
 dhaka main achche match khele, phir bhi badakismati se final main nahin pahunch paae
 This happens with every team
 haar se hi to ham jeetna sikhte hai
 The team has now slowly begun to convert those defeats into victories
 pakistan ke die baari-bharkam lakshya ke baad bagaiyr ran banaae ek wicket kho dene par aapke man main kya chal rahaa tha?duniya kii koi bhi cricket team ek yaa do khilaadiyon par nirbhar nahin hoti
 To win, the entire team has to play
 bhartiya cricket team main umdaa khilaadiyon kii bharmaar he
 Losing a wicket without a run immediately creates a pressure, but during the match, India did not allow itself to weaken anywhere on any occasion
 pakistan ne bada lakshya diya tha, lekin hamane bhi apane hi tareeke se uskaa peechha kiya or jite
 But the bowlers were ineffective
 agar aapane pich par gaur kiya ho to aap samaj hi gaye honge ki yah ballebaajon kaa swarg thi
 The outfield was extremely fast and it was very difficult for the bowlers to stop any team below 250-270
 or usee pich ne aapaki or duusare ballebaajon kii khaasi madad kii
 Yes, here i have succeeded
 pehle bhi yahaan do shatak laga chukaa hum or do is baar ke asia cap main lagaae
 It is similar to other pitches in the Indian subcontinent where the outfield is quicker
 ballebaajon kii yahaan hameshaa balle-balle hoti he
 Experts have rated your performance above the 175 runs scored by Kapil Dev against Zimbabwe in the 1983 World Cup
 kapil dev kii us pari ne to bhartiya team ko vishwa cap kii daud main banaae rakhane main madad kii thi or aakhirkaar ve cap jeet kar laae
 At one time, india-pakistan matches used to be very exciting, is there still as much tension? Some matches were really very exciting, especially the World Cup
 pichley vishwacap ke dauraan mohali main khele gaye semifinal ko hi le lijie, vah bhi kaaphi tanaavpurn tha
 The current match was special for us because we had to win it to stay in the race for the cup
 bangladesh se ham haar chuke the
 Why do you publicly display your feelings like this? Is this your old style? See, this is not abusive
 yah andar ke aavesh ko baahar nikaalane kaa meraa ek tarika he
 i do not abuse players, talk to myself, abuse myself
 khud se lagaataar kahata rahata hum: sudhaaro, pichley match se behatar karo, pichley shot se behatar shot khelo
 you can do that
 hameshaa to nahin, par haa, har shatak ke baad main apane upar yah prakriya apanaataa aayaa hum
 There must also be some reason for the internal charge to come out
 aapako nahin lagata ki cricket kaa matlab ab van de or tii 20 ho gaya he?nahin, mere hisaab se yah sach nahin
 We still meet the quota of test matches decided by the ICC today
 lekin test main bheed nahin jutati
 What to say? See, this is a problem of the crowd, isn't it? isamen khel or khilaadiyon kaa kya kasoor bhala?up-captain banane par aap khush honge, lekin yah pad dabaav bhi to banaata he
 If your bat does not shine, it can also be taken away or not? If i did not play well then i will be out of the team
 aisa nahin he ki jeet hasil hone par usase phulakar main bolnaa hi band kar duun
 Everyone has seen the change in me after winning the Under-19 World Cup
 main to pakistan se match jeetne ke baad akhbaar bhi nahin pard paaya, jinamein mere naam ke aage saikadon titals jode gaye the
 i understand the importance of the uniform of the Indian team and the position of vice-captain
 aapane of said par jis tarah se khulkar khelnaa shuru kiya he, vah jabardast badlaav kaise aayaa, bataaenge?meraa dhyaan hameshaa bain ore hi rahata tha
 Gradually it was becoming my habit and weakness
 mere coach chaahate the ki main wicket ke dayee ore ke shots par kaam karun
 He was already confident about my ability and timing to play on the leg side
 maine kaaphi mehnat kii or apni rakshaatmak takanic ko durust kiya
 i am happy that now i am able to score runs by playing on all sides of the wicket and getting big boundaries
 ab koi mujhe legi batsman nahin kahata
 And you always enjoy chasing goals, enjoy the pressure
 dekhie, dabaav vaali sthitiyon se main munh nahin churaataa
 In some of the recent matches, i have scored huge chasing big goals
 ab to ye thappa bhi lag hi gaya he
 i initially create a better platform for myself, so that i can get more runs to help the team
 aapako ab duniya kaa sarvshereshth ekadivasiy cricketer kaha ja rahaa he
 But if i do not play well, it will not take long to get the prize of the world's worst ODI player
 cricket aapke liye kitni ahmiyat rakhata he, puri eemaandaaree se bataaiega
 This is my life yahi mere liye sab kuch he
 Because of cricket, i got my father's funeral done late
 seniors se milane vaali naseehaton ne madhyakram ke ek manje hue ballebaaj ke rup main taiyaar hone main meri madad kii he or team main main apni jagah kaayam rakh sakaa
 What lesson did you learn from Dhoni? Stay on the wicket, score runs and help the team get into a better position
 unhone hi sikhaaya he ki maidan main utarate hi teji se ran banane kii hadabadi main kabhi mat aao
 i learned from them that i should not lose my wicket just by playing a foul shot
 seniors se aap kisi salaah lete hai? or haa, abhi haal main aapane sachin ko ek badi hi nijee kism kii chitthee likhi thi
 i wrote a letter to him to suggest a way through my difficult times
 main unhen dekhte hue bada hua, aaj main unke saath kheltaa hum
 They recommend a lot of work
 aapako pataa hi he, bharat main cricket kaaphi dabaav paidaa karne vaala khel he
 But cricketers earn a lot, both from sports and also from advertisements
 agar aap ek cricketer ke kariyar ko dekhen to paaenge ki yah bahut chota hota he
 In such a situation, what they get is not going to produce much or wonder
 bharat main har koi jeet chahta he
 Nobody wants to lose
 aise main sara dabaav cricketer ko hi jhelana hota he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the rally in Kolar, Karnataka on Wednesday
 bangarpet raily main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki congress kii sarkaar logon kii ummiido par khari nahin utari he
 Modi said that this election will decide the future of Karnataka for the coming five years
 aapako bataa den ki karnataka main chunaav prachaar thamane main ab sirf 48 ghante kaa samay bachaa he
 Modi's counter-attack on Rahul's statement of becoming PM also targeted the statement given by Rahul Gandhi about pm's post
 unhone kaha ki rahul kaa bayaan namdaar ke ahankaar ko dikhaata he
 How can one declare himself a Prime Ministerial candidate
 piem modi ne kaha ki congress ke namdaar, sone kaa chammach lekar paidaa hue hai or ye sona bhi videsh vaala he
 Modi said that he does not know poverty, when we built toilets, he said that Modi works for the rich
 unhone kaha ki congress netaa kaa ye bayaan congress kii aantarik lokshahi kii pole kholta he
 He said that a coalition meeting is going on to remove Modi, the feet of big veterans are being caught
 in saare diggajon ko andhere main rakhkar khud piem ghoshit kar dena gathbandhan main hi avishvaas he
 He said that the people of the country will accept the name 'immature Namdar' if Namdar does not have faith in fellow leaders of the alliance, whose ego has reached the seventh sky
 Yesterday someone made an important declaration- he said, "I am going to be PM!" He came like those bullies, barging his way ahead when there are others who have many years of experience
 How can someone just declare themselves as the PM? This is simply nothing but arrogance: PM— BJP (@ bjp4india) May 9, 2018 6 diseases of the Ginai Congress
 The Prime Minister said that the Congress has mixed the honor of Karnataka in the soil
 deshbhar ke logon ko congress ke karnaamon kaa pataa chal rahaa he, isliye deshbhar se congress ko vidaai di ja rahi he
 Now it is the turn of the Congress to leave Karnataka
 pradhanmantri ne is dauraan congress par hamalaa bolte hue congress kii 6 bimaariyaan ginaayin or inhen 6-C kaha
 Modi counted 6 diseases of Congress
 
 
 # congress culture # communilism # jatvaad # aparaadh # bhrashtachar # contractor system (thekedaari)pradhanmantri ne is dauraan kaha ki deshbhar main jin bhi rajyon main chunaav ho rahe hai, vahaan se congress saaf hoti ja rahi he
 Now Congress will be clear from Karnataka also
 unhone kaha ki logon main congress ke prati kaaphi gussa he
 PM Modi said in the rally that Karnataka is the pride of India
 unhone kaha ki upie sarkaar main sirf ek pradhanmantri tha or unka ek remote control tha
 But our government has 125 crore people in the country of remote control and high command
 There are the six evils that the Congress has brought on the nation - Congress culture - Communalism, Casteism, Crime, Corruption, Contractor system : PM Modi # bjp4betterkarnataka— BJP (@bjp4india)may 9, 2018raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi bole ki congress ko jab sarkaar main aati he to wo maanati he ki janata ne unhen bhrashtachar karne kaa contract diya he
 He said that the courtiers of the Congress are sitting in different states, their job is to bow their heads in front of the Namdars of Delhi and cheer them up
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki chaar saal baad bhi congress apni haar nahin sweekaar paa rahi he, congress sansad nahin chalane de rahi he or loktantr kii dhajjiyaan uda rahi hai
 He said that neither the Congress is a heartbroken nor the Dalits, this Congress is only a deal
 ye hi congress kaa asli karnama he
 This deal is not Modi but Congress MP Veerappa Moily has said
 unhone kaha ki virappa moili ek bade netaa hai or dilli darbar ke raaj darbari bhi hai
 He said that the Congress has played many sports for 5 years, during which money was also received and benami property was also received
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki congress party jhooth bolne main export he or kuch bhi jhooth bolte hai
 He said that right now he played a lie that the Modi government is weakening the SC / ST law, but the truth is that the Modi government has strengthened this law
 unhone kaha ki congress ne baba sahib ambedkar kaa kai baar apmaan kiya he
 Significantly, Karnataka is to vote on May 12
 rajya main 15 may ko nattejey ghoshit honge
 Many recent opinion polls showed the possibility of a hung assembly
 opanian pole main devgauda kii party jedies king mekar kii bhoomika main nazar aa rahi he
 In the India Today poll, the Congress is likely to get 90 to 101 seats and BJP 78 to 86 seats
 vahiin jedies ko 34-43 seat milane kii sambhaavna he
 Whether the Congress announces Rahul Gandhi's name for the post of PM will be known on Friday

 'he said,' When i wrote an article in which Tharoor was mentioned, his wife probably did not like that the woman she does not even know and she has praised her husband very much
 isliye unhone unase kaha ki vah mujhase baat karnaa band kar den
 Despite this, he continued to follow me on Twitter and after that he said stop following Meher as well
 ’ pakistani patrkaar ne kaha, ‘mujhe nahin pataa ki unhen unke pati ke saath phone or email ke jariye mere baatcheet karne se pareshaani kyon thi
 The conversations i have had with her can be done by anyone anywhere in the world
 ’meher ne kaha, ‘kya aapane google par unka naam dhundha? aap paaenge ki may or june se hi unki shaadi main pareshaaniyaan thim
 i was not involved in his life
 us vakt vah mujhe jaanati nahin thim or vah mujhe jimmedaar bhi nahin tehra rahi thim
 'they said,' Put their name on Google, you will see what comes out
 us par aapako unki shaadi main pareshaani kii khabaren milengi
 These news have been coming for a long time
 ’ meher ne kaha ki sunanda ne un par sabase pehle us vakt hamalaa kiya jab unhone jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla kaa intervyuu liya tha
 He said, 'he tweeted why our Chief Minister has spoken to a Pakistani journalist
 pehle pakistan sena bhejti he or phir patrakaron ko bhejti he
 They started fighting with me
 ’ meher ne daawa kiya ki vah ‘sajeesh kii shikaar’ hui hai
 He said, 'everything happened to me
 yahaan baithi hui pakistani aurat unki shaadi ko barbaad nahin kar sakati
 The Pakistani journalist alleged that Sunanda has always had a case with another on Twitter
 meher ne kaha, ‘vah pareshaan rahaa karti thim
 She was not eating anything
 unhen pet kii tibi thi
 i am not saying all this, rather it has come up in the Indian media
 agar vah apane pati se jhagada karti thim or unki sehat par asar hua to iskaa mere bare main prem kahani se kya lenaa dena he
 ' prem naam he meraa prem

 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne hindi ko lekar achaanak jo vivaad paidaa kiya, kya uski koi zarurat thi? kya bijepi ke paas vaaki koi bhashaa niti he jiske tahat vah hindi ko badhaava dena chaahati he? yaa vah hindu-hindi hindustan ke puraane jansanghee naare ko apni vaicharik viraasat kii tarah phir se aage badha rahi he?avichaarit raashtra prem ho, dharm prem ho, yaa bhashaa prem ho, uske nattejey khataranaak hote hai
 Talking about making Hindi the national language of the country, he has suddenly made those people who are otherwise without any hatred for Hindi
 haalat yah he ki dakshin bharat ke bijepi ke apane mukhyamantri tak amit shah kii raay se sahamat nahin hai
 They are talking about promoting Kannada
 philhal amit shah ke vaktavy ke alag-alag pakshon ko samajhane kii koshish karen
 Hindi does not need any Rajakripa or Rajyasraya for its spread or expansion, this is automatically proved
 sahitya or cinema ke lihaaj se hindi vaaki rashtriya bhashaa he
 He has adopted writers of other languages with great generosity and affection and has built bridges between languages
 hindi ke aam pathakon ke liye marathi ke vijay tendulkar or namdev dhasaal bhi hindi ke lekhak hai, bangla ke sharat or vimal mitra yaa mahasweti devi bhi, kannada ke girish karnad bhi, punjabi kii amrutha preetam bhi- mir or gaalib to hindi ke lekhak hai hi
 The all-india spread of Hindi in TV serials and cinema is enough to make Hindi speakers happy
 mobile or internet par hindi ke failaav kii raftaar utsahvarddhak he
 Hindi is being taught in many universities of the world
 duniya ke kai deshon main- kharaab hi sahi- lekin hindi ke lekhak dikhaai pad rahe hai
 It is a rosy scenario between which if a leader named Amit Shah puts a stone of politics in the Hindi lake then his movements go far
 achaanak hindi ko lekar kai logon kii bhrikutiyaan tan jaati hai?phir poochna hoga, isaki kya zarurat thi? kyonki ek str par hindi agar failati dikh rahi he to duusare str par sikudti nazar aa rahi he
 We are finding that Hindi medium schools are constantly closing and English medium schools are opening up
 bharat kii madhyavargeey pattee kii yuva peedi main hindi ek chhuti hui bhashaa he jise unke maa-pita, dada-daadi, naanaa-nani bolte hai
 Hindi books are no longer bought or read in middle class homes
 sach to yah he ki hindi bas ek boli main badal kar rah gai he jisamen cinema ban saktaa he
 TV serials can be made, cricket commentary filled with English idioms can be played and international conferences can be held just as Bhojpuri did
 hindi main gyaan-vigyaan ke duusare anushasano main visheshgyata kaa kaam lagbhag asambhav bana diya gaya he
 Not only physics, chemistry or biology, now history, geography, sociology and psychology have also been considered the words of a backward language
 hindi kaa pathak zyaada se zyaada anuwaad main yah gyaan paakar kush he
 The Hindi that is trending and spreading in newspapers and TV channels is such a memoryless and concerned Hindi running on the crutches of English in which some sensational rumor is only carried
 hindi ke gambhir kahalaane vaale akhbaaron ke sampadakon ko bhi hindi likhane kaa shaur nahin he
 The condition that gives competition to journalism is that of universities where 90% of Hindi professors cannot write correct Hindi
 iske samanaantar angreji kaa samrajya jaise lagaataar bada hota ja rahaa he
 English writers are now calling themselves Indian writers
 unki kitabon par hindi filmein bana karti hai
 Whereas the Hindi writer is a creature to be remembered or used by any intention
 angrezi is desh main visheshadhikaar kii bhashaa he, naukari kii guarantee kii bhashaa he, bahut sari ayogyataon par pardaa daal sakane vaali bhashaa he
 The use of an obsolete word in English makes you honorable, whereas the same work in Hindi can make you ridiculous - makes it
 modi sarkaar or bijepi kii bhashaa or samskruti niti par lauten
 It appears that the BJP loves Indianness
 lekin bhartiyata kaa matlab uske liye kya he- yah saaf nahin he
 His additional urge towards Hindutva, on the contrary, weakens this Indianness
 isi tarah vah jansangh ke jamaane se hindi-hindu-hindustan kii baat karti rahi he, lekin uske liye hindi bhi ek mithyaa garv kii abhivyakti kaa maamla dikhaai padati he
 Its leaders who speak Hindi are Hindi of darp and dawa, not of condolences
 uski yojanaon main bhi hindi kaa yah istemaal kam dikhataa he
 Her plans like Smart City, Make in India, Skill India suggest that the concept of development for her also comes in English and not in Hindi
 phir duhraane kii zarurat he ki hindi uske liye pracheen gaurav kii vah bhashaa he jisamen urdu-farsi ke shabd na hon, vah waisi panditau hindi ho jisamen gyaan-vigyaan bhale na ho sake, sanskrit kii khushboo aae
 It is not uncommon that the Sanskrit love of Hindi lovers of the BJP is also strong - they have been seen taking oath in Sanskrit
 sanskrit se kisi kaa virodh nahin hona chahie
 Sanskrit is a rich language, but it has a classical significance and should be viewed as such
 vah kisi kshetra main boli nahin jaati
 It is part of our heritage
 sankat yah he ki kuch logon kaa sanskrit prem unke sthool samskruti prem se aage nahin bad paata
 Far from learning Sanskrit, they are not ready to write or speak clean Hindi or any other language
 bhashaa darasal unke liye dharm kii tarah hi ek sampradayik agenda he
 Had it not been there, Amit Shah would have spoken in Indian languages, not Hindi
 ve angreji kii aprihaaryta se is qadar aakraant nahin hote to apane vaktavy main angreji kaa naam lene se bhi hichakate or sirf videshi bhashaa kii baat karke rah jate
 Actually, there are at least three fronts of linguistic challenges of twenty-first century India
 pehla morcha to angrezi ke visheshadhikaar se mukti kaa he, angrezi se nahin
 English as a language has been an Indian language for a long time, many schools and colleges and institutes operate in English only
 jaise-jaise angrezi seekhney vaale bad rahe hai, vah visheshadhikaar kamazor pad rahaa he
 But it is important to note that English is not a means of neoliberalism
 iske liye zaruri he ki hindi or duusari bhartiya bhashaaon ko samrudh banaaya jaae
 In them bread and employment, paths of knowledge and science should be found and opened
 yah doosraa morcha he
 The good thing is that if a large section of Hindi has gone to English, then a new section of marginalized communities whose children are going to school for the first time are also associated with Hindi
 is tarah se dekhen to hindi apane brahmanwad kii kentul kuch-kuch utaar rahi he jise angrezi pahan rahi he
 Hindi is now a language of dalit-adivasi-feminist resistance, it is not a competitor of Marathi, Bangla, tamil-telugu, Urdu, it is a language running with them in Bahnape
 lekin teesraa or sabase mushkil morcha yaheen se khulata he
 Eventually all these Indian languages are in crisis
 in bhashaaon main aa rahi nai peediyaan apana bhavishya angrezi main dekh rahi hai
 People who are very happy to see the progress of Hindi on cinema, TV serials and the internet, do not realize that in the next two decades this development is in danger of evaporating
 is khatare se bekabar bhartiya bhashaaen aapas main lard rahi hai
 Amit Shah's statement has added some ghee to this fight - after all, languages also have communalism
 dilli ke bavana ilaake kii jeje colony main bheeshan aag lag gai he
 More than 100 slums have been gutted in this accident
 haadase main ek bachche kii maut ho jane kii khabar he

 However, the police later persuaded and eliminated the people

 Police and fire brigade trains were delayed in reaching the spot due to which angry people threw stones at them

 Eight days after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) attack on the Pakistani border post, US President Barack Obama called Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and expressed condolences for the 24 Pakistani soldiers killed in the attack
 lekin obama ne is hamale ke liye maafee nahin maangi
 a statement issued by the White House on Sunday said, "the President clarified that the regrettable incident was not a deliberate attack on Pakistan and reiterated his strong commitment to a full investigation into the incident

 lekin america kii taraf se abhi tak is ghatana par pakistan se koi aupchaarik maafee nahin maangi gai he
 Meanwhile, a Republican member in the Senate, John mccain, has reiterated his allegation that the inter-services Intelligence (ISI), a Pakistani intelligence agency, is helping terrorist organizations in Afghanistan and that terrorist organizations are killing Americans

 The former BJP leader said in a joint press conference organized by the 'committee for the Defense of Teesta Setalvad and Justice in Gujarat' that after the incident, Modi ordered the Gujarat Police not to interfere in the activities of the VHP, Bajrang Dal and BJP
 ’ Bharatiya Janata Party's parliamentary party president LK Advani, in a party meeting, applauded Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and surprised many as he had attacked Modi for criticizing the Prime Minister two-three days earlier on Independence Day

 Advani also praised Modi for the fact that he had already started the campaign and called upon teenagers and first-time voters to register as voters in the Election Commission
 varisht netaa ne kaha ki ye pahalu bahut hi mahatvapurn hai kyonki mukhya lakshya he ki matadaataaon ko boot tak laana or yah sunishchit karnaa ki ve matdaan karen

 apane bhaashan main adwani ne kaha ki bhaajapa ricardtod jeet hasil karegi
 While giving a concluding speech at a meeting of BJP Election Campaign Committee, State Party Presidents and General Secretaries, senior party leader Advani praised the Chief Minister of Gujarat for emphasizing the need to strengthen the party at the booth level
 adwani ne modi kaa is baat ko bhi lekar gungan kiya ki unhone pehle hi abhiyaan shuru kar diya or kishor evam pehali baar matadaata banane ja rahe logon se chunaav ayog main matadaata ke rup main panjikaran karaane kaa aahvaan kiya he

 Disturbed by the terror of Jalandhar, rishi-munibhagwan reached Vishnu
 bhagwaan ne kaaphi soch vichaar kar vrinda kaa pativrat dharm bhang karne kaa nishchay kiya
 He threw a dead body from Yogamaya outside Vrinda's house
 maaya kaa pardaa hone se vrinda ko apane pati kaa shav dikhaai diya
 Knowing her husband dead, she fell on that dead body and started crying
 usee samay ek sadhu uske paas aae or kehane lage beti itani dukhi mat ho
 i die in this body
 sadhu ne usamen jaan daal di
 Flowing in emotions, Vrinda embraced that body
 udhar, uskaa pati jalandhar, jo devataaon se yuddh kar rahaa tha, vrinda kaa satitv nasht hote hi maaraa gaya
 Later Vrinda came to know that this is a trick of God
 is baat kaa jab usko pataa chalaa to usne bhagwaan vishnu ko shraap diya ki, jis prakaar aapane chal se mujhe pati viyog diya he
 In the same way, you will also have to take birth in the dead of death to suffer female disconnection
 yah kahkar vrinda apane pati kii arthi ke saath sati ho gai
 After this incident, Lord Vishnu incarnated as Lord Rama in Tritayuga and had to stay for a few days in the disconnection of Sita
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki vrinda ne vishnu ji ko yah shraap diya tha ki tumne meraa satitv bhang kiya he
 Therefore, you will be made of stone and that is the same form of Harika Shaligram
 iske baad vrinda apane pati ke saath sati hui
 The place where the sati was grown, the Tulasi plant was produced
 bhagwaan vishnu apane chal par bade lajjit hue
 Upon hearing this, Vishnu said, 'O Vrinda! It is the result of your Sattva that you will remain with me as a basil

 Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi has taken a big decision after facing a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 kejariwal sarkaar ne sabhi mahilaon ko metro or ditisi va cluster bason main free safar kaa tohfa diya he
 This decision will be implemented in 2-3 months, but there are also questions about why the Kejriwal government took such a big step
 virdohi daawa kar rahe hai ki vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar yah faisla kiya gaya he
 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has said that Arvind Kejriwal is in panic and has gone mad
 mahilaon ko free main safar kii suvidha dene vaale kejariwal sarkaar ke faisle ko manoj tiwari ne vot kharidne kii naakaam koshish bataaya he
 At the same time, according to Aam Aadmi Party sources, this decision has not been taken in a hurry
 party sutron ke mutabik, kai maheenon se is masale par vimarsh chal rahaa tha jiske baad yojana kaa prastaav taiyaar kiya gaya
 The Transport Department was also asked the number of women passengers and after conducting a complete assessment, a draft was prepared
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki is sambandh main sabase pehle dmarsi or ditisi se hi suzav liye gaye hai
 Why this decision was taken? a senior minister of the Arvind Kejriwal government says that the real purpose of this decision is to encourage women to use public transport
 saath hi mahila suraksha bhi ek badi vajah bataai ja rahi he
 Actually, Aam Aadmi Party has been raising the issue of women safety prominently in Delhi
 bason main sisitivi camere lagane ke daawey bhi kiye jate rahe hai
 But if no concrete steps are taken by the government in this direction, the Kejriwal government has to face criticism from the opponents
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki 3 june ko jab arvind kejariwal ne free safar kii ghoshnaa kii to yah bhi bataaya ki agle maheene (june) se sisitivi lagane kii prakriya shuru ho jaaegi or is saal ke ant tak badi sankhya main yah kaam puraa kar liya jayega
 Apart from this, government sources also say that this step can reach a large part of the electorate
 turant lagu kyon nahin kiya faisla?sarkaar ke ek varisht mantri ne ajtak ko bataaya ki is faisle ko turant lagu karnaa mumkin nahin he, kyonki iske liye bajet laana hoga or vidhansabha satr bulaanaa hoga
 Also, the suggestion of the public is also awaited in this direction
 baharhaal, kejariwal sarkaar kaa yah faisla vidhansabha chunaav kii drushti se bada masterstroke mana ja rahaa he
 The Election Commission figures show that a total of 1 in Delhi
 43 karod matadaataaon main 64 lakh se zyada mahilaayein hai
 In such a situation, if this decision of the Kejriwal government comes into force then it can have a wide impact

 Harish Chandra Barnwal's book 'modi Sutra' is going to do the work of Sanjeevani
 taala chaahe kitna bada, baari or jatil kyon na ho, sateek chaabi se bahut hi aasaani se khul jaataa he
 No matter how difficult a math question is, it is solved by a formula
 vaise hi jivan main chaahe jaisi bhi paristhitiyaan aaen, harish chandra barnwaal kii pustak ‘modi sutara’ main aasaan raah kaa rasta bataaya gaya he
 After becoming the Prime Minister of the country, Narendra Modi has emerged as a global politician
 mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri tak lagaataar modi kaa virodh hota rahaa he lekin har baar narendra modi nai shakti or urja ke saath duniya ke saamne prastut hue hai
 In such a situation, questions arise that what is the source of Modi's energy? To know it, it is necessary to read the Modi sutra
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhaashanon or vichaaron se parimarjeet karke 283 sutron kaa sankalan he modi sutara
 The sources published in the book are divided into ten separate chapters, subject wise
 ek ore jahaan pariksha dene vaale chaatro kii baat ho rahi he to vahiin vaigyanikon se lekar javaanon kii bhi baat ho rahi he
 From environment to health to individual development to the development of humanity, formulas have been formed
 sabhi sutron ko samay-samay par narendra modi dwaara die gaye bhaashanon se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 These sources are witness to the journey of Chief Minister Narendra Modi to become Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 yahi sutara bharat ke pradhanmantri modi se vaishvik leader modi kaa saakshaatkaar karaayenge
 All the sutras published in the book are more than one
 apane aap main ek-ek sutara jivan main kranti laane or mahaan kaarak banane ke liye paryaapt hai
 The author of this book is senior journalist Harish Chandra Barnwal
 is kitaab ko bloomsbari publication ne prakashit kiya he
 Readers will also find in this book a compilation of many unpublished photographs related to the life of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 16 pages
 ye wo tasviren hai jo aapako ek saadhaaran vyakti ke asaadhaaran kahani ko saamaanya tareeke se prastut karne kaa prayaas karti hai
 The author has received all these pictures from the Prime Minister's Office and the Prime Minister's younger brother Pankaj Modi
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad har koi narendra modi ke saath apane aapako jodna chahta he
 Whether he likes or dislikes Narendra Modi
 unki nitiyon kaa samarthak ho yaa virdohi
 Harish Barnwal has also written a book on Narendra Modi earlier - 'modi Mantra'
 inhone ise tab likhaa tha jab bhartiya janata party ne unhen pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar chunaa
 According to the position and status, the perspective of the reader and reviewer definitely changes
 harish kii duusari pustak ‘modi sutara’ main narendra modi us rup main nahin milenge jaisaa ki aap tamaam channelon ke tok sho yaa samachar patron main dekhte or padhate hai
 Here, Narendra Modi will be seen in a new form of readers, sometimes an environmentalist, sometimes a social worker, sometimes a yogi, sometimes a servant and sometimes a thinker
 isse bhi badhkar narendra modi is pustak main saamaajik kranti or sakaaratmak badlaav ke agradoot ke rup main pathakon ko dikhaai denge

299 only uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar jile main ek yuvak ne train ke saamne kudakar jaan de di
 The reason for his suicide was not known
 police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 On Wednesday morning, police received information that a corpse lay on the railway tracks, not far from Kirelway station
 police ne maukey par jaakar dekha to vah laash ek yuvak kii thi
 Who gave his life by jumping in front of the train due to unknown reasons
 police ne shinaakht karaane ke baad bataaya ki is 25 varshiya chaatr kaa naam ajay tha
 He committed suicide on Tuesday evening
 ajay kutabaa kaa rahane vaala tha
 And he came to the city for coaching
 ajay ke paas se koi suicide note bhi nahin mila he
 Police has sent the dead body of the deceased for post-mortem
 uske parijanon ko bhi is vaardaat kii soochna de di gai he
 input language haryana kaa jalebi baba sachmuch jalebi kii tarah tedha tha
 More than 90 girls and more than 120 porn movies
 baba ne jaise choti-moti porn industry khol rakhi thi, lekin baat yaheen tak nahin he
 The police have found out in their investigation that this baba, who trapped girls in the name of tantra-mantra and took them to their basement, used to swear an oath to them during their excesses
 bhoot-pret kaa dramababa rahasyamayi sammohan kriya main maahir tha
 Jalebi used to tell Babakhud the master of tantra-mantra
 wo mahilaon ko fansaane ke liye bhoot-pret kaa drama karata tha
 Then he drank the intoxicating drink and made him unconscious
 uske baad nashe kii haalat main hi unase karata zyaadati tha
 During this time, the vicious Baba used to secretly make pornographic videos of women
 jo ladki ek baar baba ke changul main fansati phir wo baar-baar rusavaa hoti
 Rape more than a hundred pornographic films, along with raping more than 100 women of porn films, is not a minor offense
 ye aankada kuch itnaa bada he ki sunakar yakeen karnaa bhi mushkil hota he
 Hearing what Baba is, it seems as if it is an industry of moving porn films in itself
 ashram kii aad main adharmalekin itane gunahon ko saalon-saal chhipaae rakhane ke liye kisi insaan ko jitna shaatir dimaag hona chahie, baba kahin usase bhi do qadam aage tha
 That is why he not only managed to keep his black misdeeds covered under the garb of Baba Balaknath's ashram in Tohana, Haryana, but also kept the new girls a victim
 120 se zyaada ashleel filmein baramab tak beshak 90 ladakiyon kii 120 se zyaada ashleel filmein police ke haath lag chuki hon, lekin khud police ko bhi is baat kaa andaaza nahin he ki baba kii zyaadati or ashleel filmon kii sahi-sahi ginati akhir kya he or kahaan jaakar khatm hoti he
 Surprised by Baba's misdeeds, even after the revelations of these misdeeds, undoubtedly, this most illustrious and infamous Baba Amarpuri aka Jalebi Baba has come under the grip of the police
 lekin baba kii karatootein sun-sun kar ab khud haryana police bhi hairaan he
 Such things are being recovered from Baba's ashram that it seems as if Baba had made the aim of his life to get innocent and innocent girls to get married
 baba ke saath har film main nai ladkipulice ko jab uske ek mubir ne baba kii ashleel filmon se bhari ek sidi saunpi, to uski jaanch karte hi vardeevaale bhi sihar gaye
 In every film, the basement built in Baba's ashram, the things kept in the basement, the surrounding environment, Baba's misdeeds were all the same, every time there was a new girl in the film with Baba
 baba kaa sammohanus nai ladki ko baba naa sirf sammohan or nashe ke jaal main fans kar qaabu kar letaa, balki zyaadati ke dauraan usase lagaataar shapath dilaane kii tarz main ye bulawaataa rahata ki wo ye sabakuch apni marzi se or khushi-khushi kar rahi he
 In fact, it was such a mental manipulation, after which it would be difficult for the girl to go out for some time to decide whether it was actually her own will or against her will
 baba ko remand par lekar poochtachaphilhal, police ne baba ko paanch dinon ke liye police remand par lekar poochtacha shuru kar di he
 Nine months ago, the girl who wrote the report against Baba has once again come forward and has given a complaint against Baba
 lekin abhi police ko baba kaa shikaar banane vaali un anginat ladakiyon ke saamne aakar baba ke khilaaf gavaahi kii darkaar he, jinke saath baba ne zyaadati kii or jinaki ashleel filmein bana kar unhen circulet kar diya
 So that the rest of Baba's life is left behind bars

 What is the treatment: It is necessary to give antiviral drugs within two days of the symptoms of swine flu

 After this, the patient should be admitted to the hospital immediately so that the palliative care starts and there is sufficient supply of fluids

 Swine flu prevention medication: Swine flu treatment is usually possible
 antiveiral dawaaon jaise ki oseltamivir (tamiflu) or zanamivir (relenza) se is sankraman ko thik kiya ja saktaa he
 These medicines prevent this infection from spreading and increasing its numbers
 yadi swine flu hone ke 48 ghanton ke bheetar in dawaaon kaa upyog shuru kar diya jaae to inkaa acha asar hota he
 But these medicines have to be taken under the supervision of doctors

 Apart from this, pregnant women and children below 5 years are also at great risk

 In Okhla, Delhi and Balli Maran and Jama Masjid areas of Old Delhi, people also said that there is a shortage of money across the country, hence the charge that the government is deliberately sending less cash to atms in Muslim-majority areas on religious grounds
 jamiya millia islamia ke sports complex menindian bankke atm ke aage kataron main khadey logon se jab ye sawaal poocha gaya to ek ne jaise hi ovaisi kii baat kaa samarthan kiya ki aage peeche khadey logon ne unako lapak liya
 The first person to answer, who said his name is Jameel, immediately said that Owaisi has said absolutely right, because he always says right
 faisle se dikkat to bahut ho rahi he inke jumale puure bhi nahin hue ki aage khadey syah safed dadhi vaale bade miyaan tut pade kya khaak sahi kaha he
 Do all the atms in the rest of Delhi have round the clock rupees

 lekin is mudde par raajnneeti or khaskar sampradayik aadhaar par line kheenchna katai uchit nahin he
 As soon as a student of journalism supported Owaisi's point, his friend immediately cut him off and said that this is not right

 The population of Balli Maran, Jama Masjid and Chitali Kabar area of old Delhi is more than 11 lakhs

 Shakeel Ahmed said that atms are not on narrow streets but on wide roads, but the problem is that we went out of our area to withdraw money

 He said, 'they both asked for money to get tickets to potential candidates
 hamen shikaayat mili, jiske baad hamane saboot maanga
 When the party looked at the evidence, the allegations were true
 unhone kaha, ‘lekin, kisi tarah kaa len-dein nahin hua
 Based on the evidence, we decided to dismiss both of them '
 aap sanyojak ne kaha ki party 3-4 or maamalon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Another party leader said that Rajesh Kumar of Sitapur had accused that money was being taken in lieu of tickets, which was followed by a news channel sting
 kejariwal ne media or party se tikat kii ummid paale logon se bhi kisi ke dwaara tikat ke badale dhan maangane par sting oparation karne ko kaha
 He said, 'I am giving a clear message that whoever gives money for the ticket, their money will be wasted
 ham us ummidavaar kaa tikat bhi radd kar denge jisane paisa diya he’
 He, however, denied the allegations against AAP candidate from North West Delhi and former Delhi minister Rakhi Birlan
 raakhi ne purv aap pratyaashee mahendra singh kaa sthaan liya he
 It was alleged that Birlan asked for seven lakh rupees to campaign for Singh

 They are untrue '
 unhone kaha ki mahendra singh ne party ko nahin bataaya tha ki vah jail bheje gaye the

 So fresh elections are to be held 'farooq Abdullah further said that Mehbooba Mufti should form government with BJP as soon as possible

 ol india congress cameti oversij cell ke pramukh or technocrate sam pitroda ne data company cambridge analitica or congress party ke bich kisi bhi tarah ke sambandh se inkaar kiya he
 Pitroda on Thursday defended the Congress with a flurry of tweets and also accused the media of spreading lies
 pitroda ne ek twit main kaha, 'ye khabar puri tarah bakawaas he
 This is a big lie and it should be stopped with apology
 main acchhee tarah jaanata hum ki congress party ne ateet main centre yaa rajya str par kabhi bhi cambridge analytic kii sevaaon kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 'I have been silently watching lies being spread on Indian Media, at a time to sensationalize news and mis-guide people on a variety of issues
 Some of these lies have resulted in unnecessary court cases and damaged our relationships and our thriving democracy
 - Sam Pitroda (@sampitroda) March 22, 2018 In another tweet, Pitroda said that all those in the media who said that Congress used Cambridge Analytica and paid it, all of them should accept their lies

 petrol or dijal kii badi hui keemton ke khilaapcongresskebharat bandamenrahul gandhihi chhaae rahe
 Not only did he offer water brought from Kailash Mansarovar to Bapu's tomb by reaching Rajghat, but he also appeared to lead a possible alliance
 upie adhyakshasonia gandhisamyukt vipaksh ke dharne main kuch der ke liye jarur ain, lekin na to manch se unhone bhaashan diya or na hi zyada der tak vahaan rukeen
 The question is whether Sonia Gandhi has given the responsibility of coalition to Rahul Gandhi after handing over the command of the Congress? Prior to this, the meetings of the opposition have been chaired by Sonia Gandhi
 kisi se chupa nahin he ki sharad pavaar or mamata banerjee sareekhe netaaon kaa rahul gandhi ke netritv ko lekar kya rukh he
 This is the reason that when Rahul Gandhi reached Rajghat, everyone's eyes were on who the leader of the opposition would be with him on his march to the petrol pump
 ramlila maidan ke saamne bane manch par jab vipaksh ke netaaon ne ekajute hona shuru kiya to sabaki najar is baat par tik gai ki kya rahul gandhi vipaksh kii aguwai karne ja rahe hai? kyonki tab tak tay kaarykram ke mutabik sonia gandhi ko dopaher baad petrol dijal kii badi keemton ko lekar ho rahe pradarshan main shaamil hona tha
 But suddenly Sonia Gandhi reached the platform near the petrol pump in front of Ramlila Maidan
 sonia gandhi ke pahunchate aisa laga ki ek baar phir gathbandhan kii kaman vahi sanbhaalane vaali hai, lekin thodi der baad hi unhone rahul se baat kar manch chhod diya or ghar waapas laut ain
 As soon as Sonia Gandhi left, Rahul Gandhi took over the command of the stage
 congress ke media prabharee randeep singh surajevaala ke saath milakar unhone naa sirf manch se bolne vaale netaaon ke naam nirdhaarit kiye balki unke bolne kaa kram bhi banaaya
 The most senior leader was later called to speak
 unke baad khud congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhaashan diya
 Seeing the order of the speech on the stage, it was clear that the Congress set the occasion as Rahul Gandhi's leadership
 yani sabase bada netaa sabase baad main bolaa
 In December last year, Sonia Gandhi handed over the post of president to Rahul through elections
 iske baad sonia gandhi ke raibareli se chunaav nahin ladane par bhi tamaam kayaas lagaae jate rahe hai
 Considering the health of Sonia Gandhi, it is not yet decided whether she will contest Rae Bareli or daughter Priyanka
 is bich sonia gandhi ne badi chaturaai se sanyukt vipaksh kii baithak main rahul gandhi ko hi netritv kaa mauka dekar vipakshi netaaon ko yah sandesh dene kii koshish kii ki ab rahul gandhi bhi vipaksh ke saath samanvay karenge
 Sonia Gandhi neither gave a speech from the stage nor did she stay there much longer
 vipakshi gathbandhan main agar mamata banerjee or sharad pavaar sareekhe netaaon ko chhod diya jaae to duusari pankti ke zyaadaatar netaa chaahe vah tejasvi yadav hon yaa akhilesh yadav unhen rahul ke netritv ko lekar koi dikkat nahin he
 This is the reason why Sonia Gandhi slowly but rightly wants to activate Rahul Gandhi in coalition politics
 petrol-dijal kii badi hui keemton ke khilaaf sanyukt vipaksh ke kaarykram ke netritv kaa mauka dekar rahul gandhi ke netritv kshamta ko na sirf sweekaarya banane kii koshish sonia gandhi ne kii balki isse aane vaale dinon main unhen gathbandhan ke chehre ke taur par pesh karne main bhi madad milegi
 The Maoists have intensified their activity in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's proposed visit to Khunti in Jharkhand on October 2
 unhone ek farmaan jari kar khunti ke sabhi graminon ko apana mobile jamaa karne kaa nirdesh diya he, taaki unke kisi movement kii soochna police tak nahin pahunch sake
 This decree has put a strain on the forehead of the state government
 suraksha kii drushti se yah daura sarkaar ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban gaya he
 According to sources, while the police and administration have kept their information system on high alert regarding Modi's program, the Naxalites are not backing down to break it
 unke movement kii khabar police tak naa pahunche, isliye khunti ilaake ke logon ko apana mobile jamaa karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 Scared people are silently handing over their mobile Naxalites
 ghar main koi mobile chupa kar na rakhe, iske liye naksali unki talaashi bhi le rahe hai
 In the wake of Prime Minister Modi's visit, two Naxalites were killed by security forces recently
 badi sankhya main naksaliyon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 In such a situation, they feel that the police system is overshadowing their information system
 isliye graminon kaa mobile lekar unhen dhamkee di ja rahi he ki yadi koi bhi soochna gaanv ke baahar gai, to jaan se haath dhonaa padegaa
 The police is also aware of this move of the Naxalites and is taking precautionary steps

 After not projecting any face for CM in the last several assembly elections and after winning the election, the surprise BJP is suddenly having to change its strategy due to various political compulsions
 himachal main chunaav se ain pehle bijepi ne prem kumaar dhumal ko mukhyamantri pad kaa cheharaa ghoshit kar diya
 The BJP has made Vijay Rupani its face for the Gujarat elections and even before the Karnataka elections 7-8 months, the BJP had announced to contest elections under the leadership of VS Yeddyurappa
 pehle modi kaa cheharaa tha ahmegauratlab he ki may 2014 main modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad jin-jin rajyon main chunaav hue- bijepi ne har chunaav pradhanantri ke naam or kaam ke aasare ladaa
 Or say Modi was the only face - because of which the stakes were played in every election, and in the states where the BJP government was formed, modi-shah chose the Chief Minister of his choice
 phir chaahe maharashtra main devendra fadanvis hon yaa haryana main khatter yaa phir upi main yogi adityanath or agar assam main sarvanand sonoval ko cheharaa banaaya gaya to wo congress chhodkar bijepi main aae the-jabaki dilli main kiran bedi ummidavaar bani to wo us andolan se nikali thim-jisane us vakt kii manmohan sarkaar ko hilaa diya tha
 That is, neither Kiran Bedi nor Sarbanad Sonowal were members of the BJP
 ve chunaav se pehle bijepi main aae or ummidavaar bana die gaye
 What Modi wave is coming to an end! But now even if Modi needs a face in BJP, does it mean that Modi's wave is coming to an end
 yaa modi ke vikaas kaa kakehara notebandi or jiesti ke saae main local muddon se chota ho gaya he, kyonki jis tarah 73 saal 6 maheene kii umr main prem kumaar dhumal ko mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar banaaya gaya he-wo modi ke rule-75 ko chunauti detaa he, kyonki yah sabko maaloom he ki narendra modi or amit shah kii pehali pasand je pi nadda the
 But before the election, if Dhumal's name was announced instead of Nadda, it is clear that the BJP wanted a face that understands the pulse of Himachal politics, which has the caste equations of votes
 dhumal rajput varg se aate hai, jiske himachal main 38 fisadi voter hai
 Not only this, the bjp's problem was that till the announcement of Dhumal's name, the fight in Himachal was being considered as Virbhadra vs Modi and BJP did not want to do so
 gujarat main bhi modi cheharaa nahin!lekin sawaal sirf dhumal kaa bhi nahin he, jis tarah vijay rupani or nitin patel par modi ke gujarat main hi daanv khelaa gaya-to kya uskaa matlab yahi he kigujarat menhaar kii sthiti main haar kaa thikra bijepi modi ke sir nahin phodna chaahati
 Caste equations have become important for the BJP in Gujarat, and Modi's face is buried under them
 karnataka main yedurappa par daanvkarnataka main to jis tarah may main hi bhrashtachar ke aaropon main ghire raheyedurappa koparty ne apana cheharaa banaaya-usase saaf he ki bijepi ke liye satta ahm he or karnataka ko lekar bijepi kii soch bhi saaf he ki vahaan modi kaa jaadu nahin chal saktaa or local raajnneeti ko saadhane ke liye local dhakad netaa hi chahie
 BJP is well aware that if the lotus was fed in Karnataka the last time, it was because of Yeddyurappa - and the factionalism of the party had come to the surface due to Yeddyurappa's departure
 lekin vajah chaahe jo ho-ye chehre ye bataa rahe hai ki teen ahm rajyon ke chunaav main modi baikfoot par hai, or unhen kshatrapon kii jarurat he
