 However, this time Nitish government, possibly under the pressure of BJP, has also appointed Advani as state guest and placed him in a guest house in the state, while other BJP chief ministers stayed in various hotels for the national executive
 Huh

 Actress Katrina Kaif, who came to India from London 16 years ago, has made her own identity in Bollywood
 film boom se apane bollywood debyue ke baad katrina ko industry main salmaan khan ne acchhee shuruyaat dilaane main madad kii thi
 However, Katrina made her own identity in the industry instead of just becoming Salman Khan's heroine
 salmaan ke alaava shahrukh khan, akshay kumaar or ruthik roshan ke saath bhi filmon main kaam kiya he or saraahna bhi pai he
 Katrina has been in the news for her acting, glamor, chemistry and affairs
 unke luks, chhuttiyon kii tasviren, fishan sens or filmon ke sabhi diwane hai
 But one thing for which Katrina is rarely discussed is the controversy
 aisa bahut kam hi hota he katrina caff kaa naam vivaadon main aae
 Whether it is an ex boyfriend or an actress or her relationship with the media, Katrina believes in making her relationship positive with everyone
 is baat ke saboot ke taur par katrina kaa salmaan khan se rishta le sakate hai
 At one time these two were in a relationship with each other
 donon kaa brallep hua or baaten bighad gayi
 Even then, Katrina's relationship with Salman's family was quite good and today their friendship is so good with Salman that Salman does not get tired of praising her
 iske alaava ranbir kapur ke saath rishte main rahane or kadave brallep ke baad aaj katrina kii dosti ranbir se bhi he
 Apart from this, Katrina also has a good relationship with her ex girlfriend Deepika Padukone and present girlfriend Alia Bhatt

 In married life, mutual trust between husband and wife is very important
 par kai baar shaq kii vajah se rishte main kadavaahat aane lagati he
 Some husbands are suspicious of some of his wife's actions
 aage kuch vaise hi kaam yaa vyavhaar kii charchaa kii gai he
 
 
 1
 agar patni mobile par zyada vakt bitarygar koi shaadishuda mahila mobile par zyada baaten karti he yaa Whatsapp, fasebuk par zyada active rahati he, to aise main pati ke man main shaq paidaa hone kii ashanka bad jaati he
 There is no need to have any solid foundation for such doubts
 2
 Going out in the absence of the husband If a woman repeatedly goes out of the house alone in the absence of the husband, she may come under suspicion in the eyes of the husband
 3
 Laughing with other men at parties If women go to parties and try to make more contact with other men and talk laughter, then the husband may have a prick, which can turn into doubt later
 4
 More attention to grooming, generally women tend to be more groomed than men
 par yahi baat kai baar purushon ko nagavar bhi guzar sakati he
 5
 ghar aakar bhi offis kii baaten karanaagar koi kaamkaaji mahila apane pati ke saamne offis ke sahakarmiyon kii baaten zyada karti he, to usase pati ke man main shaq paidaa ho saktaa he
 Although in today's age women are also moving shoulder to shoulder with men, but the victims of maleistic mindset can sow seeds of doubt in their mind without any solid reason, which is utterly wrong

 When the flames of others are caught on its own sheet, it should be understood that it is important to calm the fire not only on the ground but also in the mind

 Rahul Gandhi started election campaign from Maharashtra, Rahul Gandhi has gone into election campaign after the long wait for the Lok Sabha election issue as seen in the speeches of Muderraul like Rafale in his speeches
 ravivaar ko rahul gandhi ne maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke liye prachaar abhiyaan kaa aagaaj kiya
 Rahul held public meetings in many areas of Maharashtra
 is dauraan rahul ne modi sarkaar or bijepi ko gherne ke liye apane bhaashanon main rafel se lekar neerav modi or gabbar singh tex kaa zikr kiya
 That is, the issues which Rahul Gandhi made a weapon against the Modi government in the Lok Sabha elections, the same was done by Rahul in the present assembly
 rahul gandhi ne prachaar ke pehle hi din maharashtra ke latur, chandwali or dharavi main jansabhaayen kin
 In his first rally, Rahul mentioned demonetisation and bank scams
 rahul ne kaha, 'modi bolte the ki notebandi se bhala nahin hua to mujhe faansee de dena
 But who benefited from the note ban, Nirav Modi ran away
 'rahul ne kaha, 'november 2016 main notebandi or uske baad jiesti se desh kii arthvyavastha charmara gai he
 From automobiles to textiles, and from diamonds to small businesses, there is a bad situation
 sirf maharashtra main 2,000 se zyada factoriyaan band ho gai hai, vahiin neerav modi or mehul chokasee jaise 'chor' lootakar desh se faraar ho gaye
 Where are the good days? Rahul Gandhi said, 'go anywhere in the country, people are just talking about unemployment, agricultural land crisis and economy
 
 , Was promised a good day, where did he go? Did not come! No one knows how much black money was recovered after the demonetisation, but the poor and many honest people were upset

 jabaki bijepi kashmir se dhara 370 hataane or teen talaak par kanoon banane jaise bade muddon ke sahare chunaav main utar rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi is saying that instead of focusing and discussing burning issues like demonetisation, employment and scams, the government is busy showing people how the Indian Chandrayaan rocket was sent to the moon

 Political parties have created a ruckus before the by-elections in Bihar on March 11 and the Lok Sabha elections next year

 buudhvaar ko sadhu ne lojpa se istipha de diya or uske baad argedy main shaamil ho gaye
 It is believed that Anil Kumar Sadhu, son-in-law of Ram Vilas Paswan, was very upset with his neglect in the party
 jis tareeke se party kii bagdor ab ramvilas paswan ke saansad putr chiraag paswan ke haathon main he, isse damaad naakhush the, kyonki unhen lag rahaa tha ki party main unhen tavajjo nahin mil rahi he
 After leaving the LJP, Anil Kumar Sadhu targeted his father-in-law Ram Vilas Paswan and said that he has now become anti-dalit and has sat in the lap of RSS
 sadhu ne kaha ki ramvilas paswan ne nitiyon or party ke siddhanton se samjhauta kar liya he
 Anil Sadhu said that there are constant atrocities against Dalits in Bihar, but even after this, Ram Vilas Paswan and his son Chirag are sitting silent on this whole issue
 argedy main shaamil hote hi kumaar sadhu ke swar badal gaye or unhone kaha ki lalu prasad yadav bhi saamaajik nyaay ke purodha hai or garib or vanchiton ke sachche hitaishi
 Significantly, Anil Kumar Sadhu came into the limelight during the 2015 assembly election when he sought a LJP ticket to contest the election

 India did not expect such a poor start to the South African tour, but fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah said that if a failure results in the team's confidence, then it is not entitled to play Test cricket
 dakshin africa ne capatoun main pehle test match main bharat ko chaar dinon ke andar 72 ranon se haraakar 1-0 kii badhat banaai
 The second Test match will start on Saturday at Centurion
 pehle match main chaar wicket lene vaale bumraah ne kaha, ‘ek match se aatmavishvaas nahin digta he
 If this happens then you are not entitled to play
 galatiyon se siikho or aage badho
 There is no cricketer who has not made a mistake
 ’ye bhi padhein- debyue main diggajon kaa shikaar karte hai bumraah, test main bhi doharayaunhone kaha, ‘yah acha test match tha or maine isse kaaphi kuch siikhaa kyonki main isse pehle kabhi yahaan dakshin africa main nahin khelaa tha
 So i learned many things from him
 ab samay aage badhane or duusare match par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa he
 Bumrah said that he would look into the positives of the first Test match such as taking the first wicket in the form of AB de Villiers
 unhone kaha, ‘yah yaadgaar kshan tha or vahaan se hamane kai wicket liye
 My theory as a bowler is not to get too excited or discouraged after any match
 main agle match main aatmavishvaas ke saath janaa chahta hum
 Bumrah said that the Indian bowlers failed to understand the bounce in South Africa's first innings in the first Test, allowing the hosts to score 286 runs
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen pataa chal gaya tha ki hamane pehali pari main kya galati or isliye chauthe din hamane donon chor se dabaav banane kii koshish kii tathaa length par dhyaan diya jo pehali pari main galat thi
 ' bharat main vaayu pradooshan kaa asar pregnent aurat ke pehle teen maheene (triamester) ke bachche par kitna pad rahaa he, ise maapne ke liye philhal koi shodh nahin hua
 But the gynecologist Dr
 mamata sharma kii maane to khaastaur par aktubar se lekar november ke maheene ke aakhir tak pehle triamester vaali auraton ke liye khatarnaak ho sakate hai
 Actually the fetus nourishes from the mother's placenta
 lekin agar maa ke bheetar pahunchane vaali hawa or khaane main jahrile tatv honge to vah bachche ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho sakate hai
 Airborne pollutants such as carbon monoxide, particulate matter (PM) 2
 5 se hypoxia yani oxigen kii kami or pratirohak kshamta ko kam karne vaale hote hai
 Dr
 mamata kahati hai, main khud bhi zyaadaatar caces main triamester vaali auraton ko aktubar ke bich se lekar november aakhir tak apane gaanv jane kii salaah detii hum, jo yah nahin kar saktin unhen khaastaur par deepawali se lekar ek hafte tak dilli main na rahane kii salaah de rahi hum
 Even though there is no data on the trimester of pregnancy in India, this report, published in the online journal Nature Sustainability, titled Air pollution-induced missed abortion risk for pregnancies, shows that toxic pollutants in the air cause a large number of abortions in the first trimester The reasons are proven
 is report main darj aankadon ke mutabik particulet matter (piem) 2
 5, abortion cases were more frequent in the first trimester due to the presence of harmful elements such as sulfur dioxide, ozone and carbon monoxide
 beijing uniwarsity, capital medical uniwarsity, peking uniwarsity or togaji uniwarsity ke saath chaanainis of sciensej ne 255,668 pregnent auraton kaa vishleshan 2009-2017 tak kiya
 Researchers PM2
 5, sulfur daai oxide, ozon or carbon monooxide kii bhoomika kaa vishleshan kiya to paaya ki 6
 8%, ie 17,498 women had abortions due to them
 dilli main hawa kii gunvattta kaa pichley saat dinon kaa recordis tarah ke aborson ko emeft yani 'aborson in da first triamester' kehete hai
 In this, either the development of the fetus is stopped or it dies
 lekin yah garbhpaat itane chupchaap hota he ki iskaa koi asar nahin dikhataa
 There is neither bleeding nor pain
 isi liye ise silent feets kiler bhi kehete hai
 More than 39 years of age and women working in the fields increase the risk of such abortion
 bhrun kii hatya kaise karti he jahrili hawa-darasal bhrun or garbhvatee aurat ke bich kii kadi placenta ke bheetar jahrili hawa pravesh kar jaati he
 And then through the woman's breath, this pollutant enters the woman from where it reaches the fetus through the placenta
 kai duusari tarah kii kshati ke saath hi oxigen kii aapurti baadhit ho jaati he
 -PM2
 5 bhrun ke pratirohak kshamta par hamalaa karata he
 -carbon monoxide affects the metabolic process
 yani maa se bachche ko milane vaale poshan ko roak detii he
 It happens that the fetus dies due to lack of oxygen
 vikasshil deshon main 15 fisadi garbhpaat vaayu pradooshan kii vajah se hota he
 Therefore women living in cities with air pollution should be wary of this 'cold-blooded murderer' committing feticide

 Gauhar Khan is seen for the first time on the slapping of a young man by actress Gauhar Khan, who is hosting the finale of the TV show 'raw Star'
 gauhar ne is maamle ke bare puche gaye sawaalon ke kuch is tarah se jawaab die
 Gohar said, 'yes, i was attacked, i was physically more, whatever that coward tried to do and show, it was wrong, what i read in the media shows that his thinking is more Was bad! i want to say a few things': 1
 pehali baat to ye ki wo bevakoof koun hota he bataane vaala ki ek ladki ko kya pahananaa chahie
 2
 us haare hue insaan ko is baat kaa dar nahin tha ki ek nihatthi, bina taiyaar or puri tarah se apane kaam main vyast ladki ke upar hamalaa kar ke kya milegaa
 3
 agar actraces aise gande dimag vaale logon se asurakshit hai to un ladakiyon kaa kya jobechaari yahaan kaam karne aati hai
 4
 isse mujhe is baat kaa ehsaas hota he ki ek insaan kii aisi soch ho sakati he ki wo kisi mahila par haath uthaa saktaa he, agar wo ek opinian tha to, bheed kaa hissaa 3 dinon tak kyon bana hua tha? uske paas industry ke junior artist kaa card kyon hedgar wo in chizon main yaqiin nahin rakhata
 5
 use aise ghinaune kaam ke liye kisne adhikaar diya
 6
 agar kisi ko kisi baat se ittefaq nahin he, to use adhikaar he anshan karne kaa, shanti ke saath dharna dene kaa, baat karne kaa, naa ki bina vajah kisi par hamalaa karne kaa, wo bhi is soch ke saath ki wo batch jayega
 7
 ek acchhee shiksha main ye kabhi nahin sikhaaya jaataa ki aap jo hasil karnaa chaahate ho uske liye hinsa karo
 8
 mujh par atake kar ke use ye laga ki ek actress par hamalaa karke wo apni gandi soch ko aage badha saktaa he, main aagrah karnaa chaahuungi har ek mahila se ki veisake khilaaf karrwai ke liye saath den

 main yahaan par kisi tarah ke pahanaave ko pramot karne ke liye nahin ai hum, meraa bas ye kahana he ki kisi ko bhi yah haq nahin ki ve kisi ke pahanaave ko lekar us par hamalaa kare or chaahe wo aadmi ho yaa aurat sabhi ko apane hisaab se apane pahanaave ko chunane kaa adhikaar he
 10
 mujhe apane desh ke kanoon par puraa vishwaas he ki mere saath saath har ek ladki ko nyaay milegaa, jo aise hamalon kaa shikaar hoti hai
 11
 main media se bhi apil karnaa chaahuungi ki wo aisi ladakiyon kaa dard samajhe, or is tarah ke hamale kii shikaar ladakiyon kaa saath de
 12
 maine hamalaa hone ke baavjood bhi shooting puri kii, sirf is baat ko siddh karne ke liye ki har ek ladki jo mujhe dekh rahi he, wo bhi apane upar hone vaale kisi bhi julm ko sirf baithe baithe naa sahe, apana sar ooncha karke jie
 13
 mujhe pataa he ye kaayar insaan desh ke yuva kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karata he, kyonki jo or bhi log uske aas paas the, un sabane iske atyaachaar kaa virodh kiya,or kisi ne bhi iskaa saath nahin diya
 14
 main apane puure parivaar, kareebi doston, media ke logon, phens ki shukraguzaar hum, jo mere saath aise vaqt par khadey hai, or main vishvas dilaanaa chaahati hum, ki haa main dukhi hum par tuuti nahin hum, mujhe pidaa he par main kamazor nahin hum, mujhe ghaav laga he, par main or bhi majboot bani hum
 15
 mujhe rohtak ki ladakiyon par garv he, main shock main thi ki mujhe pataa hi nahin tha ki mere saath kya hua, main us vakt bhi insaaniyat ke naate soch rahi thi ki usne mujhe kyon maaraa? main bahut dari hui hum, kisi ke bhi majahab ke bare main kisi ko kehane kaa koi haq nahin, mujhe garv he ki farhaan akhtar apane 'mard' compan ko aage lekar chalate hai

 a 21-year-old student committed suicide by drinking poison at IIT Kanpur
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki disambar se ab tak teen chaatro ne aatmahatya kar lee he
 It is being said that the name of the student who committed suicide is Manjunath and he is a resident of Kanpur
 khaas baat yah he ki uske pita or bahan kii pehle hi maut ho chuki he or vah ab apni maa ke saath bachaa he
 Sources say that the third year engineering student was depressed for a few days and was in touch with the psychologist of the institute
 santhaan ko registra rakesh kumaar sachaan kaa kahana he ki manjunath ek peedit parivaar se aata he or santhaan main vishesh chaatro ke liye uplabdh cote ke tahat pravesh paakar adhyayan kar rahaa tha
 Significantly, since 2005, 15 students have committed suicide at IIT Kanpur
 bengalooru main kareeb 1500 karod rupye kaa ghotaalaa saamne aayaa he
 About 20 thousand complaints of fraud have been filed against Masoor Khan, the owner of a company called IMA
 iske maalik ne ek audio massej main shivaji nagar ke congress vidhayak roshan bag par 400 karod rupye ke gaban kaa aarope lagaaya he
 At the same time, the government has decided to conduct an investigation in this matter
 masoor khan kaa ek suicide note bhi saamne aayaa he jisamen unhone likhaa he ki vidhayak roshan beg ne 400 karod rupye nahin lautaae isliye main aatmahatya karne ja rahaa hum
 Masoor Khan has been missing since writing the letter
 jameen kharid maamla: bombai hoicourt ke faisle ke khilaaf supreme court pahunche dhananjay mundemaamle ke saamne aane ke baad vidhayak roshan beg kii samasyaayein bad gai hai
 He says that he is being implicated under the conspiracy because he recently opened his mouth against the Congress leadership in Karnataka and said that Muslims should not be the stooges of any party
 roshan beg ne kaha, 'jab se maine kaha ki musalamaanon ko kisi ke peeche nahin chalanaa chahie to log mere peeche pad gaye hai

 devband se gathbandhan kii hunkaar ke baad aaj congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi va congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi pashchim uttar pradesh main chunaav prachaar ke liye utar rahe hai
 The two leaders are beginning their campaign today from the same Saharanpur Lok Sabha constituency, where the first joint rally of the grand alliance of SP-BSP and RLD took place on Sunday and in which BSP supremo Mayawati openly appealed to the Muslims of Saharanpur not to distribute votes
 Openly challenged aise main ab tak gathbandhan ke prati naram ravaiya apnaane vaale rahul va priyanka jab saharanpur kii dharti par pahunchenge to kis andaaj main mayawati ke muslim card kaa jawaab denge, ye dekhnaa bhi dilachasp hoga
 In the eight seats of West UP, which are going to vote on April 11 under the first phase, the Congress sees its strongest position in Saharanpur
 isaki vajah 2014 ke chunaav nattejey hai, jab modi lahar ke baavjood congress ke pratyaashee imran masood bijepi ke vijayi pratyaashee raghav lakhanpal se mahaj 65 hajaar vot peeche rah gaye the
 In fact, the Saharanpur Lok Sabha constituency has around 38 per cent Muslims, which the Congress is once again eyeing and the BSP is threatening to split the Muslim vote bank, as the alliance also fielded a Muslim candidate in the form of Haji Fazlur Rahman is
 aisi hi sthiti bijanour loksabhaa seat par dikhaai de rahi he, jahaan congress ne upi kii siyasat ke bada cheharaa maane jane vaale nasimuddin siddiki ko utaara he
 Bijnor Lok Sabha seat is also about 38 percent Muslim and from here the BSP has nominated Maluk Nagar
 yani muslim pratyaashee ke rup main eklaute nasimuddin siddiki chunauti de rahe hai
 This is the reason that the Congress hopes to get the support of Muslim voters in this seat and both Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi are going to hold a public meeting in Bijnor
 rahul-priyanka ke saath jyotiraditya sindhiya bhi rahenge maujuudadonon netaaon kii aaj (somvaar) ek or jansabha pehle charan kii kairana loksabhaa seat par bhi honi he
 The Congress has adopted a strategy to wrest the votes of both the community by removing former MP Harendra Malik from Jat and Muslim dominated Kairana seat
 haalanki, congress kii yah ranneeti kitni kargar sabit ho paati he, yah bhi bada sawaal he
 Because in the 2014 elections, the BJP won all these 8 seats in the first phase
 jabaki ab sapa-basapa or areldi ke ek saath jane se sameekaran ekadam badal gaye hai
 In such a situation, with the support of Muslim voters from the Congress, the possibility of BJP winning Mayawati has expressed in Deoband rally, whether Rahul and Priyanka will be able to get any support, the answer is yet to be found
 bataa den ki sapa-basapa ke khilaaf rahul gandhi ab tak soft rukh apanaate hue ye kehete rahe hai ki unki ladaai bijepi se he or gathbandhan kii ladaai bhi bijepi ke khilaaf hi he
 In such a situation, now that Mayawati has openly surrounded the Congress, will there be any change in Rahul's strategy, this is also a big question

 muthaiya muralidharan ke 800 wicket ke jaadui aankade ko chhukar test cricket se vidaa lene ke kaaran aitihaasik bane pehle match main srilanka ne guuruuvaar ko bharat ko 10 wicket se karaari shikast dekar teen maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 1-0 kii badhat banaayi
 India's tail batsmen kept Muralitharan waiting long for the 800th wicket, but finally it was able to add a new chapter in cricket history by catching veteran off-spinner Pragyan Ojha at the hands of his favorite fielder Mahela Jayawardene
 srilankai team ne bhi muralidharan ko yaadgaar vidaai dene kaa apana vaada nibhaayaa
 With the historic wicket of Muralitharan, India's second innings was reduced to 338 runs and thus Sri Lanka set a target of 95 runs to win
 usne 14
 Won 96 runs in 1 over with no loss
 tillakaratne dilashaan ne tufaani andaaj main ballebaaji karte hue 47 gend par par naabad 68 ran banaaye jabaki taranga paranvitana 23 ran banaakar naabad rahe
 Dilshan hit Harbhajan for six to lead the team to victory
 baharhaal yah match muralidharan ke aakhri test, unki vilakshan uplabdhi or srilanka kii jeet ke liye yaad kiya jayega lekin isamen bharat ke nichle kram visheshkar ishanth sharma ke jujharupan ko bhi jarur zikr hoga jinhone naabad 31 ran banaaye or dasven number par ballebaaji karne vaale aise chauthe ballebaaj bane jinhone 100 se adhik gend kheli
 If India survived the innings defeat, then VVS Laxman also contributed 69 runs and shared a 68-run partnership with Ishant for the ninth repeat ninth wicket which is a new record on this ground
 lakshmana ne apni pari nau ran se aage badhaayaa
 He found a good partner in his debut match as Abhimanyu Mithun (25), with whom he shared a 49-run partnership for the eighth wicket
 maalinga ne mithun ko elbeadblyoo karke teesri baar pari main paanch wicket lene kaa karishma dikhaaya
 His total number of wickets now stands at 98
 iske baad ishanth ne bhi lakshmana ke saath milakar srilankai gendbaajon ko chaiyn nahin lene diya
 Not only the audience but Muralitharan's parents, wife and Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa and many former and current players also prayed for his 800th wicket
 lunch ke samay tak keval do wicket bache hue the
 Laxman was unfortunate run out after lunch
 unhone apni pari main paanch chauke lagaaye
 Now Muralitharan had the last chance to get a new place but Ojha and Ishant, who came to replace Laxman, troubled the Sri Lankan bowlers for the next 15 overs
 aakhir main vah ghadi bhi aa gayi
 Ojha tried to turn her ball but she went to Jayawardene in the first slip, who caught a record 77 catches from this bowler's balls
 iske saath hi stadium main pataakhe chhootane lage or darshak khushi main naachne lage
 Muralitharan was congratulated not only by his colleagues but also by Indians
 muralidharan ne ampire se gend lee or phir darshakon kaa abhivadan sweekaar karte hue dressing room main pahunche
 Now 22 in 133 Test matches to his name

 china ke raashtrapati shi chinafing bharat kii yatra par chennai pahunch gaye hai
 Mamallapuram, 40 km from Chennai, was chosen for talks between Prime Minister Modi and President Chinfing
 iske pehle shi chinafing ahmedabad aae the
 The tour is considered informal
 china ke raashtrapati ke swaagat kii bhavy taiyaariyaan kii gai hai
 Both will stay together for six hours in Maamallapuram i
e
 Mahabalipuram
 is mulaakaat ke liye koi saarvajanik agenda nahin he
 Nor will any statement come
 to kya baat hogi, kya hoga, abhi thos rup se kuch bhi saamne nahin he
 All that stands in front is the splendor of Mahabalipuram and its glorious history, and the ease with which the heads of the two influential countries of Asia walk in its background
 is baat kii charchaa he ki raashtrapati shi chinafing kaa jahazi bedaa itnaa bada tha ki uske utarane ke liye bada ranve chahie tha jo kisi or shahar main nahin tha
 The Chennai airport had the capability to land such ships, so it came to its place
 chennai se 56 kimi dur bengal kii khadi ke tat par mahabalipuram he jise maamllapuram kaha jaataa tha
 The name was named after the Pallava king Narasimhavarman i who was called the great warrior
 pallav raja ke kaal main ek hi chattan ko kaat kar kalakriti banane kaa kaushal samrudh hua jise dravid sthapaty kala ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Suddenly you find yourself in front of the intentions of the sixth and seventh centuries
 aaj kii technalji iske saamne maamuli nazar aane lagati he
 The Prime Minister himself showed President Chinfing by taking him to Vishnu Temple, Arjuna Penance
 pradhanmantri modi ne veshti pahana tha
 It is like lungi but is called Veshti
 aapako yaad hoga ki 2014 main jab rashtrapit shi chinafing aae the tab unhen ahmedabad le jaaya gaya tha
 After that there was a Doklam dispute but also remember that this year China did not hesitate to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
 jabaki pehle vah teen baar etzaar kar chukaa tha
 Since the conversation is informal and the agendas are not public, the focus is currently on the grandeur of the programs and the historical and current coincidences associated with them
 sammelan kaa nateeja jab tak aam logon tak pahonchega, isaki bhavyata apni jagah bana chuki hogi
 There will be a 40-minute meeting between the two leaders on Saturday but no statement will be issued
 uske baad raashtrapati shi chinafing nepal chale jaaenge
 It has been said repeatedly from both countries that the meeting of Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Chinfing is strategic
 dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko or behatar banane ke liye he
 Freely informal interactions have different consequences
 bharat or china ke bich seemaa vivaad main bhi sakaaratmak pragati kii baat ho rahi he
 Kashmir is definitely discussed, but if two Asian leaders are meeting, are they talking about the Turkish attack on Syria, the movement in Hong Kong, we are not aware of it
 is sandarbh main is baat kii sambhaavna kam hi he ki raashtrapati jinping kashmir kaa zikr karenge
 Of course, China's statement on Kashmir has encouraged Pakistan, but India too did not hesitate to object to every statement
 sanyukt raashtra sammelan main china kaa bayaan ho yaa phir pakistan main china ke rajdoot ne kaha ki kashmir ke masale par china pakistan ke saath he
 India immediately objected
 jab buudhvaar ko imran khan beijing gaye tho pakistan or china ke saajha bayaan main jab china ne kah diya ki china jammu kashmir ke tazaa halaat par nazadik nazar banaae hue he
 The problem of Kashmir should be resolved according to the Charter of the United Nations
 china aisi jatil sthiti main kisi bhi ekatarfa karrwai kaa virodh karata he
 This dispute should be settled with equal and respect
 zaahir he bharat ko pasand nahin aayaa or saaf-saaf kah diya gaya ki china jaise desh ko bharat kii sthiti kaa pataa he
 It should not interfere in India's internal affairs
 china ke media main hi yahi likhaa he ki dwipaksheeya hiton par jor rahegaa
 The personal relationships of the two leaders will intensify further
 south china marning post ne likhaa he ki china pakistan kii taraf haath badha rahaa he lekin bharat kii taraf kadam badha rahaa he
 Even after supporting Pakistan, China wants to normalize its relations with India
 china daily ne likhaa he ki mulaakaat ke dauraan donon dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko agle level tak le jaaenge
 The interests of both countries will be discussed
 seemaa vivaad or kashmir se alag hat kar bharat or china ke sambandhon ko vyapaar ke nazariye se dekha janaa chahie
 After all, why imports from China are increasing in India and exports from India to China are decreasing or not increasing
 is sthiti ko vyapaar ghaataa kehete hai
 a trade of 100 billion dollars between India and China is about to reach
 pichley saal 95
 5 billion dollars
 ab aap is aankade ko vyapaar ghate kii nazar se dekhie
 India's total trade deficit with individual countries of the world is $ 105 billion
 isamen se sirf china ke saath 53 arab dollar kaa ghaataa he
 India's trade deficit with China was $ 36 billion in 2013-14
 2018-19 main yah vyapaar ghaataa badhkar 53 arab dollar kaa ho gaya
 Imports from China are increasing, which means that India's markets are full of Chinese goods
 naukariyaan china main paidaa ho rahi hai
 China claims that 1000 Chinese companies have opened in India
 8 arab dollar kaa nivesh he or do lakh logon ko kaam mila he
 The NITI Aayog report is 2017
 is report main kaha gaya he ki 2010 main bharat ne asian deshon or china ke saath mukt vyapaar samjhauta sin kiya tha
 At that time India's trade was surplus
 ham china ko 53 arab kaa niryaat karte the
 Now it turned upside down
 china niryaat kar rahaa he
 So what did India get from this relationship between India and China
 china ke bangladesh ke saath vyapaarik sambandh behatar hote ja rahe hai
 China has offered Bangladesh to develop nuclear power plants and natural gas resources
 ek doosraa masalaa he bharat or china ke bich hone vaala riginal kamprihensive iconomik partnership (RECP) samjhauta
 This is a new regional front
 iske tahat aayaat or niryaat ke shulk ko bahut kam kiya jayega yaa puri tarah khatm kar diya jayega
 China wants to hasten the deal as it is troubled by a trade dispute with the US
 magar bharat ke bazaaron main tanaav he ki agar yah sin hua ki deyari, steel or textile kaa bazaar kamazor pad jayega
 Hence people in the dairy industry have demanded protection from the government
 aap jaanate hai ki bangladesh se saste garment ke kaaran bharat kaa textile udyog kareeb-kareeb baith gaya he
 If the import duty is reduced further, the trouble will increase
 duusari taraf bharat ke anya sector chaahate hai ki steel par aayaat shulk kam ho taaki unhen sasti steel mili
 Swadeshi Jagran Manch has announced a ten-day agitation against RECP
 aaraiseepi samjhauta hua to sarkaar manuphaccharing or kheti ke sector ko majboot nahin kar paaegi
 Leader of retail trade association Pravin Khandelwal says that losses will increase if cheaper goods come from China
 vyapaarik varg kii yah chintaa saamaanya nahin he or na hi nazarandaaz kiya ja saktaa he
 There is no need to make much headway on how much opposition the Swadeshi Jagran Manch will give to the government
 philhal bengal kii khadi main shaam ke vakt in saanskriti kaaryakramon kii bhavyata ke peeche vyapaarik varg kii chintaaen kapur kii tarah ud rahi hongi
 Industry Minister Piyush Goyal is in Bangkok on this issue
 unka kahana he ki agar bharat is nae gut se baahar rahegaa to alag-thalag pad jayega
 The regional agreement will be signed by the end of the year
 duniya bhar kii 40 pratishat jidipi aa jaaegi
 India has so far said that it gives importance to its concerns
 deyari jaise sector ko baahar rakhaa jaae
 India's economy is going through a crisis right now
 bharat kaa manuphaccharing sector ladkadaa rahaa he
 There has been no great news from this sector in the last five and a half years
 yah saanskrithik kaarykram kaa jashn kiske paksh main jayega
 In favor of India or in favor of China
 yah to agle maheene bainkank kii baithak se pataa chalegaa ki bharat kin sharton par aaraiseepi par dastakhat karata he
 India's biggest concern over the deal is the growing trade deficit and the loss of domestic industry businesses
 china, dakshin korea or australia samet samjhaute main shaamil 11 deshon se bharat niryaat kii tulana main aayaat adhik karata he yani vyapaar santulan in deshon ke paksh main he
 Our deficit with China is in the range of $ 55-60 billion annually
 samjhaute ke prastaavon ke anusaar bharat ko china se aayaat honevaale 74 se 80 fisadi, australia or newjiland se 86 fisadi tathaa japan, dakshin korea or asian deshon kii 80 fisadi vastuon par se aayaat shulk hataanaa hoga yaa usamen kami lani hogi
 For this, a period of five to twenty five years has been fixed for different items
 haalanki prastaavon main bharat ke liye yah praavdhaan bhi he ki vah kinhin vastuon ke atyadhik aayaat kii sthiti main apane gharelu udyog ko sangrakshan dene ke liye shulkon main badhotaree kar saktaa he, lekin aisa karnaa aasaan nahin hota he
 In the case of free trade, in the case of many commodities, our industries may also face stiff competition for quality and price
 kashmir par aane vaali khabaren badalane lagi hai
 The Indian Express had recently reported that the administration there is now normal that everything is under control at the place and has started speaking the language
 express ke pi vaidyanathan ayyar or adil akhzar kii report se pataa lagata he ki prashasan kii bhashaa badalane lagi he
 After the decision to remove Article 370 on August 5, people have imposed curfew on themselves instead of resistance
 ve chup ho gaye hai
 His silence has started troubling the administration
 express kii report bataati he ki prashasan ab is chuppi ko duusari tarah se padhane laga he
 He feels that this silence may not reverse
 sarkaar ne haal main kai kadam uthaae
 Banned from tourists, Farooq Abdullah was allowed to meet his party leaders
 iske baad bhi log kuch bol hi nahin rahe hai
 Other parties leaving the BJP have boycotted the election for Block Development Council
 lekin 45 pratishat sarpanch or 61 pratishat panch ward ke pad khaali hai
 In this situation what is the meaning of this election
 express ne yah report darjanon adhikariyon se baatcheet ke baad likhi he
 Everyone has negotiated off the record
 aap bhi report pard sakate hai
 Officials said in the report that no major incident has taken place, which means the situation is not normal
 ye wo kashmir nahin he jise ve jaanate the jahaan janaaza uthne par bhi hangaamaa hota tha
 After all, how to read this silence
 is sandarbh main jammu kashmir sarkaar ke ek vigyaapan kaa zikr zaruri he
 The language of this advertisement printed in Greater Kashmir justifies what was written in the Express report
 yah vigyaapan agrezi main he or pehle panne par chapa he jiskaa motaa moti hindi anuwaad is tarah se he
 
 
 'shops are closed
 pabkil transport kaa istemaal nahin, phayda kise he? kya ham aatankwaad ke aage samarpan karne vaale hai?' bade aksharon main likhaa he think
 That is to think
 aage likhaa gaya he ki 70 saal se jammu kashmir ke logon ko gumraah kiya gaya he
 Was trapped in a cycle of violence and terror

 manahani maamla: kejariwal kii yachika par aaj faisla sunayega patiala house courtmukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii patiala house court main apane khilaaf chal rahe aapraadhik manahani maamle par roak lagane kii maang vaali yachika par hai court buudhvaar ko apana faisla sunayega
 On 25 July, the High Court reserved its decision on this petition
 rajasthani paak kala main mukhya taur par shaakaahaari khaane banaae jate hai or inamen munh main pani laane vaale lajij vyanjanon kii shandaar kismein maujuud hai
 Since ancient times, spices are very much added to them in comparison to other Indian cooking, but the food is very tasty 
 rajasthani zyaadaatar vyanjanon ko pakaane main ghi kaa istemaal bahut zyada kiya karte the
 Rajasthani food has been very famous for its spicy broth and delicious sweets
 pracheen samay se hi rajasthan main mithaiyon kii dheron kismein prachlit hai, jinka swaad or anand tamaam log lete rahe hai
 In Rajasthan, sweets are eaten before meals, with main meals and after meals, so they are not like desserts or desserts
 yahi vajah he ki mishthannon ko rajasthan main kabhi desert nahin kaha jaataa
 When a guest comes to the house of a Rajasthani, he is served in a traditional way with full hospitality
 self sarvice yaa khud paroskar khaane ke usul ko yahaan beshaur mana jaataa he or isliye yah rajasthaniyon kii tahjeeb or shishtachar kaa hissaa nahin he
 Even in wedding ceremonies, the people of the bride side take special care that the groom and the baraatis should be served in thalis in the traditional way and this feast is called Sajjangot
 rajasthan main jo paak kala style apanaai jaati he, vah is registani pradesh kii prakritik jalwaayu kii sthitiyon kii bina par tay hui he
 There is a huge shortage of water and hence green vegetables in Rajasthan and the cooking here has developed in its adverse effects
 rajasthan kii registani pattee main log ab bhi khaanaa pakaane main doodh, chacha-matthey or makkhan kaa banisbat zyada taadaad main istemaal karte hai taaki pani kaa kam se kam istemaal karnaa pade
 Rajasthani people are very fond of chutneys
 yahaan dhaniya, haldi, lahasun or pudinaa sareekhe kism-kism ke masaalon kii chatniyaan banaai jaati hai
 Dal-baati-churma is probably the most popular among all the people of Rajasthan
 darasal aap jaise-jaise rajya ke ek hisse se duusare hisse kaa safar karte hai, aap paaenge ki harek ilaake kii koi na koi anokhi khaasiyat he or vah yahaan ke khanpan main bhi bakhubi jhalkati he
 Now that urban lifestyle is spreading its wings in most parts of Rajasthan, modern places of fast food, fine dining and food can be seen emerging
 yahaan ke sthaneey bascindia bhale hi gaahe-ba-gaahe aadhunik khaanon kaa majaa le rahe hon, lekin apane paaramparik khaanon kii taraf lautne kii unki gahari lalak bani hui he
 This is also proved by the fact that even in modern restaurants and places we see traditional Rajasthani food served
 main to balki yah kahuunga ki in nai jagahon ne sailaaniyon ke liye aaramdaayak maahaul main rajasthani vyanjanon kaa lutf uthaa paanaa mumkin banaaya he
 One is the love of the local people for their traditional food and then the attraction of Rajasthani cuisine of indigenous and foreign tourists also serves traditional food in newly established restaurants
 rajasthan ke vibhinn shaharon main kai mashhoor restaraan hai
 For example, if we look at Jaipur, there are restaurants like Handi and Spice Court, which specializes in providing traditional taste as well as modern taste
 handi restaraan main parose jane vaale handi chikan, handi meet or laal maas jaise nonvej bhojan bhi behad lajij hote hai
 The best thing is that while eating in these restaurants, you also get to know Rajasthani culture
 kai restaraan main rajasthani geet-sangeet se lekar vibhinn tarah ke aayojan bhi hote hai
 On the other hand, Amrai Restaurant and Upare in Udaipur are also very famous restaurants
 in restaraan kii ek or khaasiyat he ki yahaan lajij bhojan ke saath-saath city pales or jhiilon kaa dilkash najaara bhi dekhne ko mil jaataa he
 That is, the icing on the cake
 vahiin jodhpur main gypsy or indi restaraan bhi kaaphi mashhoor hai
 Gypsy is the preferred place for vegetarian food and Indic for non-vegetarian food
 rajasthan ke restaraan apni mehmaannawaaji ke liye bhi jane jate hai or milansaar vyavhaar kii vajah log vahaan janaa pasand karte hai
 Apparently, the restaurants in Rajasthan maintain diverse catering traditions

 aisi surat main congress ko 5 se 10 or siton kaa phayda ho saktaa he
 The same loss can result in seat numbers for BJP

 Yes, during the survey, people have appeared unhappy with many decisions of the Modi government
 jo ki chunaav main bijepi ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Modi appeared quite unhappy with the government's demonetisation and GST decision
 jiesti par logon kaa kya kahana he?- 51 fisadi log jiesti se asantusht hai
 - 38 percent people are satisfied with GST
 - 11 pratishat logon ne jiesti par apni raay nahin rakhi
 What was the benefit of demonetisation? - 44 percent people said yes - 33 percent people said no - 3 percent people had no idea how satisfied the farmers of Gujarat are with the BJP government? PM Modi says in almost every speech that his target farmers To double the income by 2022
 lekin survey kii maane to gujarat ke kisaan hi bijepi sarkaar se santusht nahin he

 All companies are increasing tariff rate data will also be expensive from next month
 bharat main philhal duusare deshon ke mukaable sabase sasta data he
 After the arrival of Reliance Jio, the data rate fell sharply and now the data has become much cheaper
 lekin reliance jeeyo ke industry main aane ke baad sirf data or colling saste hue, aisa nahin he balki duusari telecom companiyon kaa bura daura bhi shuru ho gaya
 Companies such as Aircel, Telenor, r-com ended, while Idea and Vodafone merged
 ab ye bhi khabar aa rahi he ki vodaphone bharat se apana bijness samet sakati he
 Customers of Airtel have also fallen
 lekin ab sasta data mahangaa hone vaala he
 Airtel, Vodafone and Reliance Jio - these three big telecom companies have announced to increase all their tariffs from December
 inamen preeped or postped donon hi yugers honge
 However, till now these companies have not released new plans
 khaas baat ye he ki ab colling ke saath saath data bhi mahangaa hoga
 Vodafone Idea reported its biggest loss so far in the second quarter
 itnaa hi nahin sitambar maheene main company ke 25
 7 lakh customers have been reduced
 exparts kaa maananaa he ki lagaataar ho rahe ghate kii vajah se companiyaan teji se apane tarriff kii keemten badhayengi
 However, the reason given by these three companies for increasing the tariff rate is AGR
 94 hajaar karod rupee kii rakam sabhi telecom sarvice prowiders ko bataur AGR sarkaar ko chukaana he
 More than half of this amount comes in the share of Vodafone Idea
 haal hi main reliance jeeyo ne IUC kaa hawala dete hue non jeeyo colling par paise lene kaa elaan kiya he
 For this, the company has launched new packs
 iske peeche reliance jeeyo ne ye tark diya ki TRAI ne kaha tha ki IUC charge ko khatm kar diya jayega, lekin aisa nahin ho paaya he
 What do the telecom companies say? Airtel and Vodafone Idea's opinion on IUC is completely different from Reliance Jio
 in donon companiyon ne kaha he ki TRAI jo IUC charge leti he wo ab bhi industry standard se kam he
 These companies say that because of this, the condition of the telecom industry is getting worse at this time
 kul milakar in companiyon kaa ye kahana he ki IUC charge or badhanaa chahie taaki is industry ko rivive kiya ja sake
 Talking about BSNL, the condition of this government telecom company is getting worse and worse
 media reports ke mutabik beasenal ko bechney kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 The retrenchment of employees has already started
 sarkaar agar 20 hajaar karod rupee kaa karch nahin chukaati he to shaayad beasenal ke 1 lakh karmchaariyon par berogari kii talwaar latak sakati he
 According to a report, the entire system is being affected due to the pending payment
 1 disambar se tarriff rate honge riviz1 disambar se bharat kii sabhi telecom companiyon ke tarriff rate riviz honge
 There will be expensive from calling to data
 haalanki ek baar main companiyaan customers ko zyada bada boj nahin dengi, lekin telecom sector main jis tarah kii chrysis chal rahi he isse lagata he ki aane vaale samay main phir se companiyaan tarriff rate badha sakati hai
 To put it simply, companies are now expecting the government for revival
 telecom companiyon or sarkaar ke bich AGR ko lekar jo baatcheet chal rahi thi
 However, taking a decision in the interest of the government, the Supreme Court has ordered companies to repay AGR which is more than Rs 1 lakh crore

 Bilaspur district administration of Chhattisgarh has filed an FIR against former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi in the caste certificate case
 bilaspur jile ke police adheekshak prashanth agarwal ne bataaya ki shahar ke civil lines thane main brihaspativaar der raat jogi ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya
 The Superintendent of Police said that on behalf of the Bilaspur Collector, Tehsildar TR Bhardwaj has filed a case against Jogi
 jila prashasan ne police ko jogi ke khilaaf chhattisgarh anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati evam anya pichhada varg (saamaajik sthiti ke pramanikaran kaa viniman) adhinium 2013 kii dhara 10 (1) ke tahat maamla darj karne ko kaha tha
 a case was then registered against Jogi
 police adhikari ne bataaya ki maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he tathaa is sambandh main abhi tak koi bhi giraftaar nahin hui he
 The high-level certification screening committee set up to ascertain the caste of the first Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Ajit Jogi, has rejected the certificate of Jogi being Kanwar tribal in an order issued on 23rd of this month
 samiti ne is sambandh main aavashyak karrwai ke liye bilaspur jile ke colector ko praadhikrut kiya jiske baad jogi ke khilaaf maamla darj karaayaa gaya he
 Here Ajit Jogi's son Amit Jogi has said that the state government is taking action with a sense of revenge
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki rajya main kanoon ke anusaar nahin, balki mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel ke ishaaron par virdohi dal ke netaaon ke khilaaf karrwai kii ja rahi he
 Jogi said that he would go to court on the matter
 purv mukhyamantri jogi kii jati ko lekar vivaad chhattisgarh main pichley lagbhag do dashak purana he
 In 2001, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Sant Kumar Netam complained to the National Scheduled Castes and Tribes Commission about Jogi's caste
 netaam ke mutabik, jogi ne farji pramaan patron ke aadhaar par swayan ko adivasee bataaya he
 At the same time, a complaint was filed in the court by Nand Kumar Sai, senior BJP leader and currently chairman of National Scheduled Tribes Commission, on this matter
 baad main yah maamla ucchtam nyaayalay chalaa gaya or varsh 2011 main nyaayalay ne rajya sarkaar ko nirdesh diya tha ki jati kii chaanbin ke liye ucchadhikaar praapt samiti banaai jaae or vah apana faisla de
 Then the Raman Singh government formed a high-level scrutiny committee under the chairmanship of Special Secretary of the Tribal and Scheduled Castes Development Department Reena Babasaheb Kangale
 chaanbin samiti ne jogi ko jari kanvar anusuchit janajati se sambandhit jati pramaan patron ko vidhi sangat nahin paaya tha
 As a result, Jogi's caste certificates were revoked in June 2017
 chaanbin samiti ke aadesh ke khilaaf jogi ne chhattisgarh ucch nyaayalay, bilaspur main rit yachika daayar kii thi
 The High Court then canceled the order of the investigating committee and once again directed the formation of the committee
 is aadesh ke baad rajya shashan dwaara farvari varsh 2018 main samiti kaa punargathan kiya gaya
 The High Level Certification Screening Committee headed by DD Singh, Secretary, Department of Tribal and Scheduled Castes Development, has ordered the revocation of caste certificate issued to Jogi
 chhattisgarh rajya nirmaan ke baad ajit jogi rajya ke pratham mukhyamantri bane the
 He was the Chief Minister of the state from the year 2000 to 2003
 is dauraan vah anusuchit janajati varg ke liye arakshit maarwahee vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak rahe
 Raman Singh became the Chief Minister of the state when the Congress was defeated by the BJP in the year 2003
 ajit jogi ke putr amit jogi ko jab congress se nishkasit kiya gaya tha tab jogi ne nai party kaa gathan kar liya tha
 He is currently the chief of Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and is an MLA from Marwahi assembly constituency
 bihar kaa package politics beshak surkhiyon main ho, lekin patna pahunchate hi ahsaas ho jaataa he ki vot ke liye poster politics kii bhi ahmiyat he
 While coming out of the platform, you see Prime Minister Narendra Modi all around
 bihar bijepi ke netaa gaayab hai, iske peeche kii ranneeti bijepi behatar samajhati hogi
 By the way, posters of Nitish Kumar are also not visible
 laga jaise vaaki bijepi ne poster par kaaphi dhyaan diya he or res main wo aage he
 But as soon as he comes out of the station, this thinking seems to change, the posters of PM Narendra Modi are not diminished, but the big posters of Nitish tell that there is absolutely no one-way competition in the matter of the poster
 donon dalon kaa apana-apana gathbandhan he, lekin poster main gathbandhan gaayab he
 It is either Nitish or Prime Minister Modi
 jediu ke poster main phir ek baar nitish kumaar hai to bijepi ke poster main aparaadh, bhrashtachar or ahankaar, kya is gathbandhan se badhegaa bihar
 If the BJP is questioning the Bihar government, then once again the JDU is confident of winning the slogan of Nitish Kumar
 lekin hairaani kii baat he bihar main 15 saal tak satta main rahe lalu prasad postaron se kyon gaayab hai
 After searching a lot, a poster of Lalu Prasad Yadav was also shown in which Nitish did not appear, yes Rabri was definitely there
 khayr poster ke saath meraa safar jari rahaa or main pahunch gaya us gandhi sethu pul par, jo uttar bihar ko rajdhani se jodta he
 The condition of the bridge is continuously deteriorating, but there is no mention in the poster about this bridge
 ye baat hairaan karti he, jis pul se hazaron gaadiyaan guzarati hai, wo pul kab tak tikaa rahegaa, kahana bahut mushkil he
 Let us not find the bridge jammed for a long time and reached Vaishali in Bihar
 nitish or piem modi ke poster to kam nahin hue, lekin ab argedy ke poster dikhne lage
 More than Lalu Prasad, his sons were seen welcoming in the area through posters
 mahua main tej pratap to vahiin raghopur main tejasvi ke postaron kii baadh he
 By the way, people of other parties are also seen to be stunned
 lekin mujaffarpur pahunchate-pahunchate phir nitish or piem modi ke poster shuru ho jate hai, baaki postaron kaa kad shaayad itnaa ooncha nahin ki wo dikhen
 Well, the election is close and the competition is face-to-face
 bas jo baat khatkati he wo he vyaktvaad kii taraf badhati raajnneeti
 If the big pictures are posted, if the plans or works were mentioned in it, then the public might also have an easy decision on who to support
 kair janata samajhadaar he or wo poster politics or package politics par nahin balki use chunegi jisaki baton main hoga dam
 The leaders of Bihar BJP are missing, BJP will understand the strategy behind it better
 vaise nitish kumaar ke poster bhi nahin dikhen
 It felt like the BJP has paid a lot of attention to the poster and is ahead in the race
 lekin stesan se baahar aate hi ye soch badalati dikhti he, piem narendra modi ke poster to kam nahin hote, lekin nitish ke bade-bade poster ye bataa dete hai ki poster ke maamle main muqaabala ek tarfaa to bilkul nahin he
 Both parties have their own alliance, but the alliance is missing in the poster
 yaa to nitish hai yaa pradhanmantri modi
 Nitish Kumar is once again in the JDU poster, then the crime, corruption and arrogance in the BJP poster, will this alliance increase Bihar? bijepi bihar sarkaar par sawaal uthaa rahi he to phir ek baar nitish kumaar ke naare par jediu ko jeet kaa bharosa he
 But surprisingly, Lalu Prasad, who was in power in Bihar for 15 years, is missing from the posters
 bahut dhundne par lalu prasad yadav kaa bhi poster dikhaa, jisamen nitish nahin dikhe, haa rabari zarur thim
 Well my journey continued with the poster and i reached the Gandhi Setu Bridge, which connects North Bihar with the capital
 pul kii haalat lagaataar bighad rahi he, lekin is pul ko lekar poster main kahin koi zikr nahin he
 It is surprising that the bridge through which thousands of vehicles pass, how long that bridge will last, it is very difficult to say
 chaliye arase baad pul par jam nahin mila or bihar ke vaishali pahunch gaya
 The posters of Nitish and PM Modi did not diminish, but now posters of RJD started appearing
 lalu prasad se zyaada unke bete ilaakon main poster ke zarie swaagat karte nazar aae
 Tej Pratap is in Mahua and there is a flood of Tejaswi's posters in Raghopur
 vaise duusare dal ke log bhi damakham lagaate dikh rahe hai
 But after reaching Muzaffarpur, then the posters of Nitish and PM Modi start, the height of the other posters may not be so high that they look
 khayr chunaav nazadik he or muqaabala aamane-saamne kaa he
 The only thing that strikes is the growing politics towards individualism
 jitani badi tasviren lagi hai, agar usamen yojanaayen yaa kaamon kaa zikr hota to janata ko bhi tay karne main shaayad aasaani hoti ki kiskaa saath den
 The public is sensible and will not choose poster politics and package politics but will choose the one who will have power

 During this time, Delhi Police not only tortured him in every way but through the operation he got magnetic chips placed near his head, intestines and appendix
 iske baad 22 may 2008 ko use jail bhej diya gaya
 In the petition given in the court, when the chip is heated, he has said that since the installation of the chip, he has become like a robot which is being operated by someone else

 " Encouraged by the Lok Sabha Election victory, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has put all its strength in the assembly by-elections to be held in 11 seats in the state
 pichley upachunaavon kaa acha anubhav na rahane ke kaaran bhaajapa is baar apni haar kaa myth todna chaahati he
 The BJP organization and the government have put their full strength together for the by-election
 bhaajapa is baar 10 siton par chunaav lard rahi he, jabaki pratapgarh seat sahyogi apana dal (es) ke khate main di gai he
 Out of these 10 seats, BSP and SP had won only two seats in Jalalpur and Rampur in the 2017 elections, but now BJP is eyeing all
 bhaajapa kii koshish he ki is baar ke chunaav main sabhi siton par jeet darj ho, taaki abhi tak hue upachunaavon main hui haar kaa myth tut sake
 Prior to the announcement of the election, Chief Minister Yogi, State President Swatantra Dev and Organization General Secretary Sunil Bansal have made their presence known through several programs by visiting the constituencies

 In every area, a program is being organized by State President Swatantra Dev or a minister of the State Government

 vah 18 oktober ko saharanpur jila kii gangoh, rampur, aligarh jile ke iglass vidhansabha kshetra main chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit karenge
 a senior BJP worker, on the condition of anonymity, said that this by-election is very important for the BJP
 agar yah upachunaav vipaksh jeet jaataa he to sattadhariyon kaa manobal kamjor hoga
 The year 2022 will also be difficult in the elections

 Senior political analyst Prem Shankar Mishra says, "the BJP wants to break the myth of defeat in the by-election

 At the same time, no big face has come from the opposition in the promotion of his candidate nor is any program proposed

 However, before the challenge was accepted by Manish Tiwari, many Congress leaders questioned this fitness challenge
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri se kaha ki vah eendhan kii keemten kam karne kii chunauti sweekaar karen, varanaa congress deshvyapee pradarshan shuru karegi
 At the same time, Congress spokesperson chief Randeep Surjewala asked Modi to deal with challenges like national security, jobs, corruption and minimum support price to farmers
 rajd netaa or bihar ke purv up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki fitness chunauti se nipatane se pehle modi ko khaali peton ko bharne or desh ke berozegaron ko naukariyaan dene kii chunauti kaa saamana karnaa chahie

 ' Arun Jaitley is no more, very few people would have known that if he had not been there, neither the CBI investigation of the fodder scam would have happened and neither Lalu Yadav would have gone to jail
 iske alaava unhone nitish kumaar ko bhi mukhyamantri banane main ek ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi, jiskaa dhindhora unhone kabhi nahin peeta
 Arun Jaitley, being active in the student movement since the 70s, most of the non-bjp parties of Bihar, especially from the Samajwadi movement, recognized the leaders closely
 bihar kii raajnneeti main arun jetali kii asal bhoomika chaara ghotaale ke daur se sakriy rup main shuru hui
 At that time, the petition was filed in the Patna High Court by Sushil Modi, Saryu Rai, Shivanand Tiwari and Lallan Singh, in which Ravishankar Prasad debated and got fame
 us yachika ko draft karne se lekar daayar karne tak arun jetali kii bhoomika ahm thi
 When the Bihar government went to the Supreme Court after the CBI inquiry order from Patna High Court, all the top lawyers of the country were engaged for their advocacy
 or yachika karne waalon kii taraf se arun jetali or jorge furnandij (tab samta party ke adhyaksh ) ke kaaran shanti bhushan ne bahes kii thi or sibiai jaanch ke faisle par akhirkaar supreme court ne bhi apni muhar lagaai saath hi patna hai court kii monitering kaa bhi aadesh hua tha
 This is a case where the CBI has managed to punish more than 90 percent of the accused and even today Lalu Yadav is in jail
 lekin jab jaanch chal rahi thi tab bhi kai baar ye maamla sarvocch nyaayalay kii choukhat tak pahunchaa
 Every time Arun Jaitley either debated himself or suggested another option to debate
 tamaam raajnneetik shakti ke baavjood chaara ghotaale main aaj jail main sazaa kaat rahe hai or is puure maamle main arun jetali kii bhoomika ek chanakya kii rahi
 Lalu Yadav was weak because of the fodder scam but Rabri Devi's reign in power continued
 isi samay arun jetali ko bihar bijepi kaa prabharee banaaya gaya
 You can say that with this, the real countdown of Lalu Raj started with the power of Bihar
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main endie gathbandhan ko maatr 11 siton par jeet mili or nitish kumaar apni puraani seat se chunaav haar gaye
 The UPA government was formed at the Center and Lalu Yadav got the responsibility of the Ministry of Railways
 is haar se endie gathbandhan hatotsahit tha or 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main rabari devi kaa waapas aana tay mana ja rahaa tha
 But due to Sir Futawal in lalu-paswan, the results were hung
 aakhirkaar bihar main pehali baar vidhaan sabha kaa satr aahut hue bina raashtrapati shashan laga
 Arun Jaitley, like a clever strategist, made absolutely no mistake in realizing that the people of Bihar want to get rid of Rabri Devi and that the people of Bihar also want an alternative face from the NDA
 jahaan nitish kumaar kii reating rail mantri rup main unke dwaara kiye gaye kaamon ke kaaran anya netaaon se kahin adhik thi
 Within a month of the election result, a campaign to break the Lok Janshakti Party Legislature Party was carried out in which Arun Jaitley and the people of BJP played an active role
 haalanki centre main lalu yadav ke dabaav ke kaaran madhyaraatri main cabinet kii baithak bulaakar vidhansabha ko bhang karke bihar main raashtrapati shashan lagaaya gaya
 (about which Lalu Yadav still believes that his political life is a big mistake) Taking advantage of this decision, where Arun Jaitley filed a petition against the decision of the cabinet in the Supreme on the one hand and on the other in the next six months They also started preparing for the upcoming elections
 jab unhen is baat kaa andaaza ho gaya kii samta party main gutbazi ke kaaran party kaa ek dhada nitish kumaar ko netaa nahin maanegaa tab unhone pramod mahajan ko vishwaas main lekar bihar ikai kennetaon kii naaraazgi jhelte hue nitish kumaar endie kaa mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karavaaya diya
 Then also advised Nitish Kumar to go on justice journey across Bihar
 oktober november ke chunaav main jetali ne khud patna main chunaav prachaar kiya or akhirkaar lalu rabari yug kaa samaapan ho gaya
 Nitish Kumar got the majority and since then Nitish Kumar has remained the Chief Minister of Bihar (barring a few months)
 jaankaron kii maane to na keval nitish kumaar ko siem banane balki susheel modi ko up-mukhyamantri banane kaa mul idia bhi arun jetali kaa hi rahaa
 Whenever there was a serious crisis in the NDA coalition of Bihar (such as a few months before the 2010 assembly elections when Nitish Kumar canceled a dinner based on an advertisement given by Narendra Modi, the alliance was moving towards a breakdown)
 Arun Jaitley took command
 shaayad isiilie bijepi ke sabhi netaa maanate hai ki arun jetali kii bhoomika party main ek sankat mochak kii rahi
 Despite all these actions of Arun Jaitley, the fierce anti-lalu Yadav never spoke harsh words against him
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jetali ke sabhi ke saath vyaktigat sambandh madhur the
 After this, when Jaitley became active in cricket politics, Lalu Yadav (who was the president of Bihar Cricket Association) used to do what Jaitley wanted from him
 yah baat kisi se chhipi nahin he
 After the defeat in the 2015 elections, Jaitley realized that no government could be formed without Nitish
 tab lalu yadav ne apane maamle kii pairvi main unase milane ke bahaane apane saath gayi prem gupta ke munh se kuch aisi baaten kahalava di jiske bare main nitish kumaar ko jaankaree milte hi mahagathbandhan ke sarkaar ke patan kii neenv pad gai
 Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh has been taunting the statement of Shivraj Singh Chauhan (shivraj Singh Chouhan), saying that 'tiger' will be protected in the state
 digvijay ne kaha, 'tiger kaa sangrakshan kiya jayega
 It is becoming a rare creature
 ' digvijay singh kaa yah bayaan aise samay main aayaa he, jab iske pehle purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha tha ki 'kisi ko chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he, tiger abhi jinda he
 'let us tell you that the former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan gave assurance to the voters of the state to remain relaxed after the formation of the Congress government in the state in a very unique style
 bollywood ke 'sultan' salmaan khan kii film 'tiger zindaa he' se prabhavit hokar shivaraj ne apane nirvachan kshetra budhani kii janata ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, aage kya hoga, is baat kii chintaa na karen, kyonki 'tiger abhi zindaa he
 Expressing gratitude to the voters of Budhni, Shivraj Singh Chauhan had said, "no one has to worry about what will happen next
" main abhi yaheen hum
 
 
 Tiger is still alive 
 
 'hanuman kii jati bataae jane ke sawaal par singh ne kaha, 'yogi adityanath ne kaha ki bajrang bali dalit the, bukkal nawab ne unhen musalmaan bataaya, ab bhaajapa ke mantri choudhary sahab unhen jat bataa rahe hai
 Those who are saying so should apologize and the VHP and the Akhara Council should despise such people
 'bataa den ki haal hi main sampann hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress rajya kii kul 230 siton main se 114 par jeet hasil kar sabase badi party ban gai thi, jabaki BJP ko 109 siton par jeet hasil hui thi
 Apart from these, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati got two seats, Samajwadi Party (SP) got one seat, while independents won four seats
 baad main, BSP tathaa SP ne congress ko samarthan dekar unki sarkaar banavaa di
 Although the film Manikarnika is being appreciated among the audience, the controversy between Kangana Ranaut and co-director Krrish of the film has come to light
 krish kaa aarope he ki kangana film main sab kuch khud hi karnaa chaahati thim
 She did not want to let any other character dominate, so she shortened the roles of the other characters
 yahaan tak sonu sood kaa kirdaar 100 minute se 60 minute kaa kara diya, jiske baad unhone film chhod di
 Krrish said during an interview - "the film was completely edited in June
 dabing bhi sirf kangana ke kirdaar ko chhodkar sabhi kii puri ho gai thi
 Kangana was shooting for "mantle Hai Kya" in London
 jab ve waapas lautin or film dekhi to boleen unhen ye pasand ai, lekin ve isamen chote-mote change chaahati thim
 a few days later, she said more of it, more of it
 is ladki kaa damdaar he, uskaa damdaar
 This has to change, it has to change
 unhone kaha ki produsar camel jain ko bhi film pasand nahin ai
 " # onewordreview

 com / 9qqho1ni4c— Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi (@manikarnikafilm) January 26, 2019 The director agreed to re-shoot some parts, which would take six days of extra time, with no Kangana needed
 unhone prasoon joshi se salaah lee ki kaise hoga
 After this, Kangana suddenly insisted on killing Sonu's character Sadashiv Rao in the interval itself
 jo ki puri tarah itihaas ke khilaaf tha
 Krrish said that when it came to producer Kamal Jain, he said what difference does it make, do what is in the interest of the film
 camel jain ne kangana kaa paksh liya
 When Krrish refused to direct this part, Kamal Jain said that Kangana will direct it
 krish ne kaha ki sonu sood kaa kirdaar kangana ne 100 minute se 60 minute kaa kara diya, jaahir he ki iske baad koi bhi film nahin karnaa chahega
 While they had shot for 35 days
 unka anya kirdaar bhi kangana ne edit karakar chote karvaa die

 yah sab sunne or dekhne main beshak behad hi ajeeb or daraavna lag rahaa he lekin yah dilli ke ek ghar kii sachai he
 Actually, the body of a woman locked in a sack was found a few days ago in an area of delhi
 police ne is maamle kii gutthi ko sulajhaate hue hatya ke aarope main ek ladi dancer or uske liv-in-partner ko giraftaar kiya he
 Who stayed in the room with the woman's corpse for two days
 police ne khulaasa kiya he ki dilli ke shakarpur thane ke antargat aane vaala je and ke block main mililashalima naamak ek mahila kii thi
 Who was beaten to death by the accused named Feroze and Suman alias Pooja
 in donon uski hatya ke baad uskaa cheharaa damege karne kii koshish bhi kii thi, taaki uski shinaakht na ho sake
 According to the police, Halima was a dancer by profession
 vah firoz ke saath live-in-relationships main rahaa karti thi, lekin chaar saal pehle vah usase alag ho gai thi
 Feroz then lived with Suman alias Pooja in a flat in Laxmi Nagar
 isi dauraan haleema ek baar phir se firoz ke sampark main aa gai
 Shikwe fell between the two
 haleema dobaaraa firoz ke saath rahanaa chaahati thi
 So she was trying to get Suman out of Feroze's life, but Feroze considered Halima unfaithful, so wanted to get rid of her
 police ne bataaya ki beeti 27 july kii raat haleema lakshmi nagar main firoz ke flats par ja pahunchi
 Suman was also present there
 is bich teenon ke bich khub kahasuni hui or uske baad firoz or suman ne haleema ko buree tarah peeta
 The matter did not end here, the two together strangled Halima and murdered her
 hatya ke baad suman or firoz ne haleema kaa cheharaa bigaadane kii koshish bhi kii taaki uski shinaakht na ho sake
 After that both of them put the corpse in a sack and set it up
 poochtacha main firoz ne police ko bataaya ki usne alima se assam main jaakar shaadi kar lee thi haalanki is baat ke abhi koi saboot nahin mili hai
 The most shocking thing is that Feroze and his live-in partner Suman first murdered Alima and then put the body in the bed box and 2 days and nights both of them not only slept in this bed but planning to hide the corpse Kept doing it too
 do din tak in donon ne laash ko ghar main rakhkar hi khaanaa banaaya or khaanaa khaaya or tivi bhi dekha
 Two days later, Feroze bought two big plastic bags and brought Alima's body in it and put it in the sack and came near the house by throwing it in the garbage
 ab police ne donon aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya he

 - When Gandhi left college, his family friend Mavji Dave Joshiji advised him and his family that he should go to London to study law
 lekin kyonki isi saal unke bete heeralaal kaa janm hua tha isliye unki maa nahin chaahati thim ki wo apane parivaar ko chhodkar dur jaaen
