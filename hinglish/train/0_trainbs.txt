 The river turns into a kind of large pond
 aap bhi yadi kabhi is rail root se jaaenge to aapako aise drishy dikhaai denge
 i think that this water has not made this line hollow, because water finds new paths on new land, it has its own speed, its own path
 suchanaaen yah bhi aa rahi hai ki baandh kaa pani choda gaya, yaa bhar gaya
 Confirmation remains, but i do remember the Narmada floods of September 1999
 is baadh main bhi chaar dinon tak narmada nadi ke ek kinare par fansaa rahaa tha
 The floods did not come as much from the rains, because of the simultaneous release of water from the Bargi Dam in Jabalpur, Barna Dam and Tawa Dam in Hoshangabad
 ise dub kshetra main paanch se chah din tak baadh ne tabaahi machaai thi
 The comments ab jabaki puri narmada nadi par jagah-jagah bade-bade baandh banaakar use chote-chote jalaashyon main tabdeel kar diya gaya he, tab bhugolic sanrachanaon main badlaav kaa asar yun bhi najar aa saktaa he
 In this, the negligence of the monitoring system of the railway is clear, but from this point also it needs to be investigated whether this is only the accident of the railway department

 326 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue mejabaan team ne tisare din buudhvaar ko stamps tak teen wicket ke nuksaan par 131 ran bana liye the
 Now the entire bowler is on the Indian bowlers because they have to take the seven wickets needed to win
 tisare din kaa khel khatm hone tak carabian team lakshya se 195 ran dur thi
 It is up to Daren Bravo and Shivnarine Chanderpaul to bring him to the threshold of victory
 chandrapaul 24 or braavo 30 ran banaakar khel rahe hai
 After their team's third wicket fell on 80 runs, both batsmen shared an unbeaten 51-run partnership for the fourth wicket

 The Caribbean team has lost the wickets of Adrian Barath (38), Lendl Simmons (27) and Ramnaresh Sarvan (0)
 barath or simons ne carabian team ko tej shuruyaat di thi
 Both added 62 runs in 11 overs
 barath ne apni 36 gendon kii tufaani pari main chaar chauke or do chakke lagaae jabaki simons 41 gendon par teen chauke or ek chakka lagane ke baad ishanth sharma kii gend par out hue
 Barath was caught in the slip by Praveen Kumar at the hands of Suresh Raina
 praveen ne apana chauthaa wicket jhatka
 After this, Sharma made India a big success by dismissing Sarwan at zero
 isse pehle, bharat ne duusare din ke apane score teen wicket par 91 ran ke aage khelnaa shuru kiya
 Rahul Dravid, who returned unbeaten on 45 for the second day, scored a brilliant 112, bringing the team total to 252 runs

 For the West Indies, captain Darren Sammy and Devendra Bishu took four wickets each while Ravi Rampaul and Edwards got one each
 nae pradhanmantri ko tatkaal hi urja par ek acha-khaasaa bhaashan dena chahie
 In this, stating the seriousness of the energy crisis, the government's intention should be clear that it wants to exploit the country's hydrocarbon resources and accelerate the use of renewable energy
 iske alaava urja sangrakshan or sakshmata ko badhaane, aarthik vruddhi, urja maang tathaa paryaavaran sangrakshan ke bich gathjod ko kamjor karne ke liye ek bahupaksheeya ranneeti viksit karnaa chaahati he
 The Prime Minister should emphasize that energy will be looked at in a consolidated and holistic manner and the government will bring a bill in the winter session of Parliament on energy accountability and security
 is vidheyak ke madhyam se urja aatmanirbharta, suraksha or tikaaupan ko hasil karne ke bare main khaakaa taiyaar kiya jayega
 a clear scale will also be set to fully measure the progress made on this path
 urja niti taiyaar karempane bhaashan ke 100 din ke bheetar hi pradhanmantri ko piemo ke tahat ek urja mahakama gathit karne kaa elaan karnaa chahie
 The PM should state that this Department of Energy Resources and Safety will formulate a consolidated energy policy, a policy that will be the focal point of defining international energy security and ensuring that the 'energy and resources of India Energy Inc
' To assist in efforts to purchase foreign assets
 yah vibhaag research ke kshetron ko tay karegaa, technology saajhedaari ko viksit karegaa or nae vichaaron ko khaad-pani degaa
 The Energy Department will be the 'energy Ombudsman' of this sector, with full regulatory responsibility and will be the main point of dialogue and contact with the public about the rationale and rationale of the government's energy policy
 pradhanmantri ko yah baat saaf kerani hogi ki is vibhaag kaa uddeshy philhal urja maamle dekh rahe mantralayon—petroleum, koyala, bijli, akshay evam gaiyr paramparaagat urja or parmaanu urja—kaa poorak bananaa nahin he, balki aise masalon ko dekhnaa he jo in mantralayon ke daayre se bache rah gaye hai
 During this 100-day period, the Prime Minister should meet the Chairman of ONGC, Oil India and Coal India with the Petroleum and Coal Secretaries to discuss increasing production
 pradhanmantri ko oengisi or oil india ko nirdesh dena chahie ki ve apane tel or gas kshetron se recovery rate maujuuda 28 fisadi ke ausat se badhaakar kam se kam vaishvik ausat 40 fisadi tak to le jaaen
 The next Prime Minister should ask the Chairman of Coal India to remove the decline in production and stop the increased trend of coal imports
 iske badale main sarkaar ko in piesu adhikariyon se vaada karnaa hoga ki unhen atishay nigaraanee or dakhsandaaj afasarshahi se bachaakar rakhaa jayega
 They also have to clear the way for the red coalition and the hanging coal project in the absence of clearance
 sahmati banaaenurja samavarti suchi kaa vishay he
 The opinion of both the central and state governments runs in its development
 agle pradhanmantri ko urja ke vivaadaaspad masalon par rajnatik sahmati banani hogi
 The Prime Minister should convey the message to the Chief Ministers that they want to address the issues related to State Electricity Boards, electricity generation, price, subsidy, Goods and Services Tax (GST), land acquisition, regulation and clearances
 aarthik masalon par vyapak samjhaute hone chahie
 Electricity boards have to be allowed to charge profit-based tariffs, keep energy prices in line with the market, curb subsidies — if subsidy is given, it is given from the public exchequer and transferred directly to beneficiaries — implementing GST And make the clearance process more efficient
 lekin rajnatik dabaav ke aage jhukna nahin chahie
 The result of that is that the energy crisis in the country is becoming increasingly frightening
 agle pradhanmantri ko ek saal ke lakshya ke saath aisa samaadhaan pesh karnaa chahie jo aarthik rup se samajhadaari bharaa or rajnatik rup se sweekaarya ho
 Private sector investment is unavoidable for energy self-sufficiency
 chaahe jeevashm eendhan main nivesh badha kar aapurti badhaane kii baat ho, urja kii bachat ke vibhinn madhyamon se maang ko simit rakhane yaa clin technology ke jariye paryaavaran sangrakshan kii baat ho, nijee kshetra kii bhoomika aprihaary he
 However, the private sector remains troubled because of the government's policies on contracts, prices, marketing, and the bureaucratic manipulative surveillance
 pradhanmantri ko saal bhar ke bheetar hi is dharna ko badalane kii bharsak koshish kerani hogi
 On the policy front, this means asking the Petroleum Ministry to ensure that the terms of the new Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) are competitive and flexible, allowing open accrual bidding under the 'cost Oil in production-partnership Agreement' The 'recovery principle' should be maintained and the 'venue Sharing' model should not be removed and the same tax benefits are given in gas production
 Go a like oil is found in production
 iskaa matlab yah hoga ki si
 The Rangarajan Committee's suggested eight dollar per mmbtu gas price should be pushed forward and the gas industry should be given infrastructure status
 pradhanmantri ko koyala mantralay par is baat ke liye dabaav bananaa hoga ki vah kol mining ke aanshik nijeekaran ke madhyam se kol india ke ekadhikaar ko kam kare
 The Prime Minister will also have to cooperate in the efforts of the Ministry of Power for 24-hour power supply in the country
 utpaadan, transmishan or vitaran vyavastha ko alag-alag karke, sahi eendhan, technology ke chunaav ke madhyam se bijli utpaadan main sudhaar karke, alag-alag tarah kii keemten tay kar or vitaran tathaa transmishan main hone vaale nuksaan par ankush rakhkar bijli mantralay yah lakshya hasil kar saktaa he
 Make the trustworthy At the end, the Prime Minister will have to engage everyone to work with banks to develop a model that can leverage banking facilities for the development of energy infrastructure in the country — gas pipelines, coal transportation, port facilities
 Do it vyaktigat rup se pradhanmantri ko desh-videsh kii pramukh urja companiyon ke pramukhon se milanaa chahie or unhen yah bharosa dena chahie ki sarkaar ek pratispardhi, paardarshee, nishpaksh or bazaar aadhaarit rajkoshiya tathaa kaamkaaji dashaaen pradaan karne ke liye patibaddh he
 India will now have to move towards non-fossil fuel system
 ab iske arthshaastra main sudhaar ho rahaa he
 mckinsey estimates that the cost of installing a solar power unit decreased from six dollars per watt in 2010 to just 2 today
 60 dollar prati wat rah gai he or 2020 tak yah or ghatakar 1
 Can reach up to $ 60
 haalanki iske anuroop grid kii ‘smartnes’ main sudhaar nahin ho paaya he
 India has the ability to be the leader on the clean energy front
 is sthiti ko hasil karne ke liye is sector ko rajnatik sahyog, kaaryakari spashtataa or sanghathanaatmak lacheelepan kii jarurat hogi
 Revival of solar, wind and nuclear energy options and the development of 'smart grids' associated with them should be a constant priority throughout the pm's term

 a marriage relationship is much better than a live-in relationship
 shaadi ke bandhan main kapal liv-in relationships se kahin zyada samrudh hote hai
 Regarding health or economic status, the status of married couple is comparatively better
 ye sabhi daawey hai ek british think-tanks institute for phisakal (iesces) ke
 According to IFS, married couples are not only relatively healthy but they are also more educated and in good jobs
 vah kaaphi kam vakt main apana ghar bana lete hai
 They do not have to struggle to pay all their bills due to their considerable earning
 yaheen nahin, report ke mutabik vivaah sutara main bandhane ke baad rishta tuutane ke chance bahut kam rah jate hai
 Couples are also able to raise children better
 acchhee dekh-rekh ke kaaran bacchon ko smoking jaisi buree aadaten nahin lagati
 The IFS report outlines several reasons why married couples are better off than live-in couples
 ek vajah yah bhi he ki liv-in main rah rahi yuvatiyaan shaadishuda yuvatiyon kii apeksha zyada pareshaan or kamjor hoti hai
 They are less capable than married women in handling responsibilities

 com / oatnii203m — BCCI (@BCCI) December 5, 2017 Explain that Shikhar Dhawan turns 32 on December 5
 is din dhawan ne bharat kii duusari pari ke dauraan 67 ran banaae
 Dhawan, who was ruled out of Nagpur Test because of his sister's marriage, missed a century (94 runs) in the second innings of the first Test of the current series in Kolkata
 chaar saal pehle mohali menaustraliake khilaaf dhawan ke balle kaa kamaal puri duniya ne dekha tha
 He not only scored a century on 85 balls while batting, but also made a world record for the fastest century in Test debut
 us match main dhawan ne pehali pari main 174 gendon main 187 ranon kii dhuandhar pari kheli thi
 Praising Sachin Tendulkar for the intense preparations before each match, former Indian coach Greg Chappell said it was wonderful to focus on the small things, though he was overly cautious about some things
 tendulkar ne agle maheene westeindies ke khilaaf apana 200waan test match khilne ke baad test cricket se sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Chappell was the coach of the Indian team from 2005 to 2007
 unhone tendulkar kii kuch adbhut vishishtitaaon kaa khulaasa kiya
 He said, 'he was overly cautious about his batting and bat
 vah apane balle kii safai karne main hi ghanton bitaa detaa tha
 He only saw bat
 'chapel ne kaha, 'jab tendulkar ballebaaji karata tha vah apane balle par ek bhi dhabba nahin dekhnaa chahta tha
 If his bat is not looking right, he also did not feel well
 unka choti-choti chizon par dhyaan dena adbhut tha
 He said, "tendulkar's routine before a match was very special
 vah sab kuch vaisaa hi karnaa pasand karte hai jaisaa ki pichley match se pehle unhone kiya tha
 For example, the same person will throw him the ball all the time
 vah apni dincharya main badlaav pasand nahin karte
 The way Tendulkar had a routine, i have never seen before or since

 Former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav, accused in the fodder scam, is now facing difficulties
 vajah he ki sibiai kii vishesh adaalat main lalu prasad kii ore se chaara ghotaale main apana paksh rakhaa ja rahaa he
 With this, the countdown to the speculation of his going to jail has also started
 iske pehle lalu prasad kii ore se chaara ghotaale kii sunwaayee ko lambaa khinchne ke liye tamaam hatkande apanaaye gaye
 The extent was reached when Lalu Yadav filed a petition in the High Court seeking transfer of the fodder scam hearing to another court citing the proximity of the JDU MLA of the CBI judge, who is hearing the RC 20A / 96 case
 haalanki lalu prasad apni daleelon se na to hai court ko or na hi supreme court ko santusht kar sake
 Therefore, his appeal was rejected in both the courts one after the other, which proved all efforts to postpone Lalu Prasad's case, and the case was started in a special CBI court
 isi silsile main sowar se lalu prasad apana paksh rakh rahe he
 In this case, he is accused of illegal withdrawal of about Rs 37 crore 70 lakh from the Chaibasa treasury
 gauratlab he kii is maamle main abhiyojan paksh kii gavaahi puri ho chuki he
 At the same time, out of a total of 392 accused, statements of almost all the accused except Lalu Yadav have been recorded
 bataate chale ki RC 20A / 96 maamle main lalu prasad ke saath-saath dow
 Many high profile people are accused including Jagannath Mishra, former MP Jagdish Sharma
 ab is iske baad agle kuch dinon main is cese kaa faisla aa jane kii ummid he
 As of now, in 53 of the 53 cases filed under animal husbandry scam, the verdict has been passed
 chaara ghotaale ke is hai profile maamle main bihar ke purv mukhyamantri lalu prasad yadav par chah maamle he
 Five of them are listed in the Special CBI Court of Ranchi and one in Patna
 jisamen aaj kii mukademe ke alaava chibasa koshagaar se saal 92-93 main 37
 68 crores is the case of RC 68A / 96
 jisaki gavaahi chal rahi he
 RC 47A / 96 is a case of illegal evacuation from Doranda in Ranchi with evacuation of 184 crores, whose testimony is going on
 RC 38A / 96 dumka koshagaar se 3
 There is a charge of illegal evacuation of 47 crores
 jisaki gavaahi chal rahi he
 RC 64A / 96 is a case of illegal withdrawal of 97 lakhs from Deoghar treasury, whose testimony is going on
 RC 63A / 96 bhagalpur tregeri kaa maamla he jisaki sunwaayee patna ke special sibiai court main ho rahi he
 There is a provision for a maximum sentence of seven years in all these cases running on Lalu
 saal 1994 main pashupaalan vibhaag main chaara kharidne ke mad main hue avaidh nikasi ke in maamlo main 1996 main hi cese darj kiya gaya tha or kul 111 logon ko abhiyukt banaaya gaya tha jisame 31 pashupaalan vibhaag se jude adhikari he
 The rest of the department consists of employees and suppliers
 ab tak jin maamalon kaa faisla aa chukaa he unamem chaara ghotaale kii cond sankhya RC 31 / 96 main sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ne 41 aropiyon ko sajaa sunai thi
 In this case, Rs 48 crore was illegally withdrawn from the Doranda treasury of Ranchi
 adaalat ne pashupaalan vibhaag ke teen adhikariyon ko 2-2 karod kaa jurmaane ke saath saat saal kaid kii sajaa sunai
 The accused included former Rural Director KN Jha, Junal Bhengraj and Assistant Director KM Prasad
 vahiin godda koshagaar se 37 lakh kii avaidh nikasi ke maamle RC -33 / 96 main 10 aropiyon ko sajaa sunaayi gayi jisame argedy ke purv saansad aarake rana or bijepi ke purv emele dhruv bhagat ko paanch-paanch saal kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 At the same time, if Lalu Prasad is proved guilty in the eyes of the court and he is punished, his political career can be eclipsed
 kyonki supreme court ke haal ke aadesh ke mutabik agar kisi vyakti ko do saal se adhik kii sajaa milti he to wo shaks chunaav nahin lard saktaa he
 In such a situation, all eyes are on the decision of the special CBI court in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections

 Not only the common people and farmers were disturbed by the demonetisation, but it has also created a dispute between mian-bibi about money
 isaki baangi madhya pradesh main dekhne ko milti he, jahaan pati-patni ke jhagadon ko sulajhane ke liye bane paraamarsh kendron main is dauraan darj hone vaale maamalon main badhotaree hui he
 Gauravi president Sarika Sinha said, 'domestic violence figures have increased a lot in Madhya Pradesh after demonetisation
 ' gauravi- van stop chrysis centre he, jise madhya pradesh shashan kaa lok swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan vibhaag or acshanad dwaara sanyukt rup se chalaaya jaataa he
 Sarkar said that after the announcement of the 8 November connotation, many such cases came in 'gauravi', in which women gave their husbands 500 and 1000 rupees of invalid notes to their husbands to replace them with banks, But later their husbands did not return these money to them
 is kaaran miyaan-bivi ke bich takaraar hone ke kaaran unke sambandhon main khatas ai
 Sarika said that there were some cases in which old notes of 500 and 1000 rupees hidden by wives were found even after December 30
 inako lekar bhi pati-patni ke bich jhagade hue or naubat marpet tak pahunch gai, jiske chalate gharelu hinsa ke maamle darj kiye gaye
 In the counseling centers, these fights are being ended by convincing both the parties
 pehle 50, to ab har maheene aae 200 kesaisi bich, gauravi kii sanchalika shivani saini ne bataaya, 'november se janvari tak bhopal sthit unke 'gauravi centre' main gharelu hinsa ke har maheene lagbhag 200 maamle register hue hai, jabaki isse pehle lagbhag 50 maamle prati maah aate the
 He said that out of the 200 cases of domestic violence against women, most of them were complaints of fights and beatings between mian-biwi for lack of money from demonetisation
 shivani ne kaha, 'gharelu hinsa pehle bhi hoti thi, lekin notebandi ke baad gharelu hinsa ke maamle bahut bade hai
 Shivani said, 'there have been many such cases in our counseling center in which women complained that their husband did not fill LPG in the house due to lack of money after demonetisation, did not bring food and drink for children, daily
 They did not bring essential commodities like milk, vegetables and fruits as they could not withdraw their money from the bank
 is samasya ke kaaran bhi kai pariwaron main aapasi jhagade hue
 He said that after Kinotbandi, we are hearing and giving advice on 200-250 such domestic violence cases every month
 nimna or madhyam varg kii mahilaayein zyada peeditshivani ne bataaya ki jo mahilaayein paraamarsh centre main gharelu hinsa kaa maamla lekar ai hai, unamem dainik mazdooree karne vaale, nimna varg evam madhyam varg kii mahilaaye hai, kyonki notebandi ke baad unhone jo paisa apane pati se chhupaakar bachaaya tha, vah zyaadaatar 500 or 1000 rupee ke noton kii surat main tha, jinhen bainkon se badla ja saktaa tha
 But many of these women did not have ration card, Aadhaar card and bank accounts, due to which they could not change these money themselves
 in mahilaon ne in paison ko apane pati ko bainkon se badalawaane ke liye diya tha, lekin bank se puraane note badalane ke baad kai logon ne apni patni ko yah dhan waapas nahin diya
 On the contrary, they started taunting their wives that they stole their earnings from their pockets, which led to quarrels between them
 shivani ne bataaya ki haalanki, bahut achche pariwaron se aisi dikkatein nahin ai hai
 Now in the quarrels, a little commissioner said that now the cases of money-related domestic violence cases have started coming down
 unhone bataaya, 'notebandi ke baad lagbhag 3 maheene badi dikkatein rahi, ab thodi raahat milane lagi he
 After demonetisation, many women complained that their husband not only beat them up for hiding money and saving money, but also drove them out of the house
 ' madhya pradesh mahila ayog se mili aankadon ke anusaar bhi oktober main mahilon par hui gharelu hinsa ke 59 maamle unke saamne aaye, jabaki november main ye maamle badhkar 68 or disambar main 86 ho gaye
 Thus, according to the data of the Women's Commission in domestic violence cases, there was a growth of 15 percent in November and 45 percent in December as compared to October
 haalanki, mahila ayog kii ek sadsy ne bataaya ki gharelu hinsa ke maamalon main kisi maheene main vruddhi to kisi maheene main kami yun bhi aati rahati he
 Rita Tuli, Senior Counselor of All India Mahila Parishad, said, '10 to 15 cases of domestic violence are heard daily at the Women's Counseling Center under her supervision at Jahangirabad, a Mahila police station in Bhopal and some of them have come due to demonetisation
 ' reeta ne bhi kaha ki kai mahilaon ne paraamarsh ke dauraan shikaayat kii ki apane pati se chhipaakar jo paise unhone jamaa kar rakhe the, unhen notebandi ke baad apane pati ko badalawaane ke liye dena padaa, kyonki kai mahilaon ke bank main khate hi nahin the
 "he has locked me in the room and is sitting outside watching
 mujhe ab jaakar apana phone waapas mila he

 If possible, you come

 But should i call Esha? She will be nearest
 mujhe jaldi bataao
 "air hostessesia, who gave life by jumping from the third floor of her house in Panchsheel Park in Delhi, sent her friend Rakhi on whatsapp that afternoon from two to 56 minutes to 3 to 11 minutes
 lekin iske thik ek ghante baad yani thik shaam ko chaar bajkar 12 minute par anisia ne apni saheli ko jo massej bheja, wo behad daraanevaala tha
 He wrote "I am going to kill myself
 mayank ne mujhe is haal main pahunchaa diya he
 He finally kicked me out of the room, but the damage he has done
 uski bharpai nahin ho sakati
 "and before Rakhi, who was sitting far away, could stop her friend Anisia from doing so, Anisia jumped from the third floor at exactly 18 minutes after four thirty minutes
 iske aage jo kuch hua, wo har kisi ko pataa he
 Anishia was immediately picked up by her husband Mayank with the help of nearby people and rushed to the hospital, where doctors declared her dead
 ab is maamle main police ne anisia ke pati mayank ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya he or ye baat bhi takreeban saafe ho chuki he ki anisia ne upar se kud kar jaan di he
 But the question of the death of this air hostess still remains
 sabase bada sawaal to yahi he ki aakhir mayank ne anisia ko wo koun sa nuksaan pahunchaaya tha, jisaki bharpai nahin ho sakati thi? us rose mayank ne anisia ko kamare main band kyon kar diya tha? usase uskaa mobile phone kyon chin liya tha? or donon ke bich ladaai kii vajah kya thi?zaahir he, maamle kii jaanch kar rahi dilli kii hauz khaas police ko in sawaalon kaa jawaab dhundhana he
 Well, it seems from this chat that Anisia was so upset with Mayank's excesses that she committed suicide, but according to those who know Anisia, she was not a suicidal girl, but she was very strong-willed and strong Was a girl
 lekin ye to rahi anisia kimautase pehle apni saheli ke saath hui baatcheet kaa sach
 Now a complaint given to the police from Anisia's family members last month has also come to light, in which they told that their son-in-law Mayank is harassing Anisia and can take her life
 anisia ke pita major general ropinder singh batra ne dilli police ko 27 june ko ek chitthee likh kar bataaya tha ki mayank anisia kii jaan lekar use haadasa yaa khudakushi bataa saktaa he
 Of course, now that Anisia is dead, the question is also the police
 or police kii ye javabdehi bhi he ki wo is chitthee main likhi gai baton ke hawaale se bhi maamle kii tafteesh kare
 Politics about demonetisation is also growing very fast

 com / weo1tyato7 — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) November 15, 2016 Significantly, the mother of the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, reached the bank herself on Tuesday to exchange the old note deposited with her
 gandhinagar ke oriental bank of commers main piem kii maa ne 4500 rupee badalawaae
 Significantly, after the denial of five hundred and thousand notes, the discussion on this issue is hot all over the country
 vipakshi dal centre par aam logon ke saamne aa rahi dikkaton kaa hawala dete hue hamalavar hai, to vahiin lambii kataron main khadey log vyavastha kii shikaayat kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the pm's mother going to the bank herself and changing the note is a big message that everyone should support this decision of the government
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki bank ne piem kii maa ko do hajaar ke note or 10-10 kii gaddi di he
 Now, Kejriwal has given a wind to politics by tweeting on this issue

 Broadcasting of some TV channels stopped due to this cyber attack

 It is important to mention this attack because cyber attack is going to steal all the peace soon by becoming another form of terrorism

 dillike dariyaganj main sthit kasturba aspataal main doctor or nursing staff kii hadtaal se marij pareshaan hai
 Angry doctors and nursing staff have gone on strike due to non-payment of salary for several months
 kasturba aspataal kii immergency main bed khaali pade hai or doctor gaayab hai
 Poor patients are lying in the hospital outside the emergency and their families are bouncing around
 aasapaas ke duusare sarkari aspataalon main bhi hadtaal hone se marij laachaar hai
 a patient relative, Shanu Ansari, said, "they have been coming since eight o'clock in the morning, no one is ready to see here, they are having a rash with the doctors, who will be responsible if something happens to the patient
 ' ek duusare marij ke parijan arun ne kaha, unke marij ko bleeding ho rahi he, kai aspataalon main chale gaye, sab jagah hadtaal he
 a patient named Tabassum told that today we have come from seven o'clock, had called empty stomach, now no one is watching
 contract par kaam kar rahe sabhi doctor aspataal ke baahar jamaa hai
 Nursing staff complain that neither salary comes on time and the hospital account also misbehaves
 nursing staff kii head manju ne kaha, 'ward main mariz dekhne ko koi nahin he
 Even after a lot of luck, the salary of the permanent staff comes after the 24th
 contract par kaam kar rahe doctoron or nursing staff kii selary kai maheene se nahin mili he
 The account section also bothers us
 'doctoron kaa kahana he ki unhen selary har maheene time se milani chahie or jab tak inaki maang nahin maani jaaegi, ye log hadtaal par hi rahenge
 Neither the BJP nor the Congress nor the BSP have been able to win consecutive seats in the Sumavumali assembly seat of Morena district in Madhya Pradesh
 yahaan har vidhansabha chunaav main trikoniya muqabla hi dekha gaya he
 However, this seat is currently in the possession of the BJP
 vidhayak hai satyapal singh sikarwaar
 In the 2013 election, he was successful in winning by getting 61557 votes
 yahaan unhen basapa ke ajab singh kushavaah ne kadi takkar di thi
 He received 47481 votes
 jabaki congress kii baat kii jaae to edal singh ko 41189 vot mili the or wo tisare sthaan par rahe the
 If the current situation of Sumavali seat is seen then bjp's position here is good
 naa to party netaaon ke bich kalah he or naa hi kaaryakartaaon ke bich koi vivaad he
 The caste equation occupies a decisive position in this seat
 yahaan gurjar, sikarwaar (rajput) brahman va kushavaah matadaata chunaav main bada pherbadal kar sakate hai
 The impact of the recent Dalit and forward caste movements in these areas can also be seen in the elections
 haalanki, is baar kaha to yah bhi ja rahaa he ki vidhayak satyapal singh sikarwaar kaa tikat is seat se cat saktaa he
 Because his elder brother Satish Sikarwar is also in the race for ticket from BJP from Gwalior

 In the Champions Trophy, the match between India and Belgium can be compared to a fast moving car in high traffic, where the Indian team has to remember the most famous rule of traffic - 'caution has taken place, accident has happened'
 
 
 duniya main chauthe number kii team belgium kaaphi tej raftaar se khelti he or unke paas aakhri lamhon tak gol karne kii thos yojana hoti he
 This European team defeated India 3–2 during the World Cup in The Hague (holland) this year
 us match main belgium ne aakhri gol match khatm hone se 20 second pehle kiya tha
 He repeated something similar against Australia in the defending Champions Trophy
 yahaan unhone aakhri gol match khatm hone ke hooter ke bajane ke saath kiya
 The ongoing Champions Trophy in Bhubaneswar is now at a stage where there is no scope of mistake for any team
 team india ne lig maichon main kai galtiyaan kin or behatar khel dikhaane ke baavjood pool-bi main tisare number par rahi, lekin holland ke khilaaf mili jeet ke baad toornament main team kaa rutaba bad gaya he
 a victory over the world number two team after 28 years in the Champions Trophy has not only given respect to Team Hockey India, but has also increased the team's strength four times
 lekin phir bhi lig ke pehle do maichon main haar kii vajah se team hockey india ke captain sardaar singh bad-chadhakar daawa nahin karnaa chaahate
 The captain says that for the last one or two years the Belgian team is doing well, we will try to control their strong aspect and play the match according to their strength
 badi jeet ke baavjood team ko apni galatiyon kaa ahsaas he, isliye aaraam ke liye chote vakt main bhi team ne apni kamazoriyon ko dur karne par kaam kiya he
 Midfielder Gurbaz Singh says that both teams will play the next match with speed
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki bhartiya team saavdhaan he
 He says, "we can't take the match easy, but we are not under pressure either
" 
 
 agar ham galtiyaan nahin karenge to ham match jeet sakate hai
 
 
 " bhartiya draig flikar ve raghunatha kehete hai, "belgium ke khilaaf hamen zero se start karne kii zarurat hogi
 
 
 We will need to give 100 per cent
 
 
 quarter final yaa nokout deal main match ekadam alag hota he
 
 
 We will put our 100 and 200 percent in the quarter-finals and expect the result to be in our favor
 
 
 " On the other hand, Belgium captain John John Dohmen says that the Indian team is very good
 unhone toornament main bahut acha khel dikhaaya he
 It would be a big thing to win against them
 ham unke khilaaf ek achche match kii ummid kar rahe hai
 He also realizes that India will get good support from the audience at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar
 lekin bharat ke dach coach rolent oltmens belgium kii takat se acchhee tarah vakif hai
 He says that Belgium is a good team, but he said that the Indian team has prepared for it
 vah kehete hai ki bhartiya team mukaable ke liye betaab he
 Belgian coach Jeroen Delmi appears impressed with the Indian team
 vah kehete hai ki bhartiya team ke paas speed bhi he or hunar bhi
 He is also impressed by the Indian team's penalty corner ability
 bharat ke teenon draig flikaron kii ginati vah duniya ke behad majboot draig flikaron main karte hai
 He has devised a strategy against it
 holland ke khilaaf jeet se bhartiya team main josh to bhar gaya he, lekin ab galatiyon kii gunjaaish nahin he
 If the team does not make mistakes in a knockout match, then it is a golden opportunity for Indian hockey to make history

 The jdu's Muslim candidate is inactive in Saran so that Muslim votes can be gathered to Rabri Devi
 lekin modi ko rokane ke chakkar main nitish apane puraane virdohi lalu prasad ko dobaaraa majboot karte dikh rahe hai
 Probably in the hope that the forward assembly, fearful of Lalu's rise, can leave the BJP and join him in the assembly elections
 raajnneeti main jo dikhataa he, vaisaa hota nahin
 What happens is seen after it happens
 bihar main kuch-kuch aisa hi ho rahaa he
 Nitish is behind that everyone agrees
 bijepi-paswan aage hai, ye bhi kai log maanate hai
 But where Lalu will start and where to stop, there is still no consensus on this

 har nav-vivaahit jode kii tarah arunachalam muruganantham bhi apni patni ko khush dekhnaa chaahate the
 He used to do whatever he had to do to woo his wife
 par ek din sabakuch badal gaya
 He may not have even known that his concern for his wife would become the reason for a quarrel between them
 maahvaaree ke dauraan ek din unki patni ek puraane kapade ko pad kii tarah istemaal karne ja rahi thim
 Muruganantham did not like it and took this problem of his wife over himself
 unhone us puraane senetary pad kaa vikalp taiyaar karne kaa faisla kar liya
 He had as much knowledge about periods and about sanitary pads as any normal man would
 par unhone faisla to kar hi liya tha
 They had decided that they would make a sanitary pad that is cheaper than other branded sanitary pads sold in the market and most importantly, safe
 par kuch soch lenaa utana mushkil nahin he jitna use karke dikhaanaa
 He failed many times in his attempt
 kuch kamyaabi bhi mili lekin
 
 
 It took him about four and a half hours to make his dream come true
 is dauraan sabase bura ye hua ki unki patni, jise wo sabase zyada pyaar karte the,unhen chhodkar chali gai
 In connection with this project, Muruganantham used to ask a variety of questions, asking people to solve it, which was quite uncomfortable
 unki patni ko ye saamaanya nahin laga or wo unhen chhodkar chali gayi
 The hope of Muruganantham's life, for which he had set this dream, had gone away from him
 unki patni ne sochaa tha ki unki judaai main shaayad muruganantham ye kaam chhod den or pehle kii tarah ho jaaen
 But this did not happen
 muruganantham apane lakshya ko paane ke liye koshish karte rahe
 He tried to understand this process not as a man but as a woman
 khud senetary pad pahanane or samaadhaan talashte rahe
 Tried to know what problems women face during that and what their needs are
 unhone is khoj ko sateek banane ke liye kai survey kiye
 Talked to hundreds of women about this
 ant main ek din aisa aayaa jab unhone vaaki wo kar dikhaaya jo unhone soch rakhaa tha
 Today, they are not only making world class sanitary pads, but these pads are also much cheaper than the sanitary pads sold in the market
 unke is kaam se judakar kai logon ko rojgaar bhi mila he
 When his wife came to know about his story, he realized how wrong she was
 paanch saal baad unhone apni pati ko sampark kiya or ab wo unke saath is kaam ko aage badha rahi hai

 yahaan yaad rakhane vaali yah baat he ki jis gend par dhoni ran out hue agar wo no ball bhi hoti, to bhi vah out hote
 (as per the rule, the number of players who are within 30 yards or more, more or less, is called no ball
 no ball rahane par ran out ke alaava kisi or tareeke se ballebaaj out nahin ho saktaa
 That means Dhoni would have been run out even if the umpire had given no ball) @ ICC @ cricketworldcuphow this kind of activities hapens? Are the umpires are blind or you guys? 3? Guptil who is standing in the long, made an run out (dhoni)! We # indianfans need an answer for this! Pic

 Dhoni hit a six off the first ball and wanted to take two runs off the second ball
 doosraa ran lene daude dhon martin gaptil kii diarect hit se pehle balla krij par nahin rakh sake or yaheen bharat kii ummiden khatm ho gayi
 Dhoni faced 72 balls and hit a six and a four

 Workers of the ruling Janata Dal United of Bihar will now go to every village and appeal people to watch this film
 ye apil khud party supremeo nitish kumaar ne apni party ke padaadhikariyon kii ek baithak main kii
 Nitish also said that if the filmmaker accepts his request, he would like the film to be shown at every square intersection of the state through mobile video theater
 iske liye wo kaaryakartaaon se anurodh karenge ki koshish karen ki zyada se zyada log is film ko dekh saken
 Actually Nitish Kumar feels that through this film he can respond to the fundamentalism of BJP

 At the party meeting on Saturday, Nitish Kumar admitted that the message of PK can be fiercely fought against the fundamentalist forces
 isse pehle 31 disambar ko pike dekhne ke baad unhone film kii jamkar prashansa kii thi or ise tex free karne kii bihar sarkaar se apil bhi kii thi
 DG Vanzara once used to be special to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, but what happened now that he has declared a rebellion to Modi
 paariwarik sutron kii maane to yon shoshan ke aarope main fanse asaram kii giraftaar ne vanjaaraa ko hilaa kar rakh diya or modi par se unka bharosa uth gaya
 Vanzara wrote a 10-page letter from the jail asking him to resign from the police service, saying that Modi was God to him, but he left him in jail
 vahiin, mumbai mirar ke sutron ke mutabik police seva se istipha dene ke baad vanjaaraa ne apane ek rishtedaar se kaha, 'mere bhagwaan (modi) jab mere guru (asaram) ko hi nahin bachaa paae to ve mujhe kaise bachaayenge
 'vanzara is said to be a supreme devotee of Asaram, who considers himself a god
 vanjaaraa asaram ke ahmedabad ke motera sthit ashram kaa doodh pite the, kyonki vah use guru kaa prasad maanate the
 Even during his posting in the border district of Banaskantha, he used to ask for milk from Asaram's Gaushala in Ahmedabad
 aura to or vanjaaraa rojaanaa sabarmati jail main bhi aasaraam ke ashram se gaay kaa doodh mangate the, lekin jab unhen mumbai kii taloja jail main transfar kar diya gaya to yah silsilaa khatm ho gaya
 Vanzara, who considers himself a nationalist patriot , was shattered by the arrest of Asaram and the silence of bjp's undeclared PM candidate Narendra Modi
 vanjaaraa ke parivaar ke ek sadsy ne mumbai mirar ko bataaya, 'sahib (vanjaaraa) pichley saat saalon se dhairya banaae hue the
 He was sent to Taloja jail due to dirty politics
 or aasaraam baapu pichley saat saalon se sahib kii takat bane the, lekin unhen bhi giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Saheb believed that his Lord (modi) would save his Guru
 lekin ab ve puri tarah tut chuke hai
 According to the news, Asaram also wrote about two dozen poems in praise of his mentor Asaram in jail
 vanjaaraa sabarmati jail se akasar hi asaram se phone par baaten kiya karte the, lekin taloja jail main shift hone ke baad yah baatcheet bhi band ho gai
 Significantly, DG Vanzara is accused in the Sohrabuddin encounter, Ishrat Jahan encounter and Tulsi Prajapati encounter
 vanjaaraa kaa aarope he ki mushkil vakt main modi ne unki madad nahin kii or iske liye wo modi ke kareebi amit shah ko jimmedaar tehraate hai
 In his 10-page letter, Vanzara writes, 'I want to tell that i kept silence for so long just because i considered Narendra Modi to be God
 lekin amit shah ke bure asar main unhone bhagwaan kii tarah meri koi madad nahin kii
 Amit Shah has captured Modi's eye and ear
 pichley 12 saal saalon se amit shah bakrii ko kutta or kute ko bakrii bataa kar modi ko gumgaah kar rahe hai
 In a way, Amit Shah is running the government of Gujarat and due to this criminal negligence, Modi's government will be evicted
 'diji vanjaaraa 2002 se 2006 tak ahmedabad krime branch main disipi or adishnal seepi ke pad par tainaat the
 He was also posted as DID in the Gujarat ATS
 aarope he ki isi dauraan hue soharabudddeen, ishrat jahaan or tulsi prajapati encounter main vanjaaraa ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 He was arrested in 2007 and has been in jail since then
 odisha ke sambalpur jile ke talabira gaanv main 9 disambar ko 40,000 ped kaat die gaye
 In fact, on 28 March, the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests 1, 038
 187 hectare par maujuud jangal kii jameen par koyale ke khanan ke liye neveli lignoin corporation (enelsi) ko duusare str kaa clearence de diya he
 About one and a half lakh trees will have to be cut for this project
 enelsi ne adaani samooh ke saath khaanon ke vikaas evam usase koyala nikaalane ke liye contract sin kiya he
 On the other hand, Talabira village residents say that they have been developing and protecting this forest for decades
 yahaan tak ki talabira graamy jangal cameti bhi is van kshetra kii suraksha ke liye banaai gai he
 This committee also appoints a guard to protect this forest
 guard ko gaanv rojaanaa teen kilo chaaval diya jaataa he
 The people of the village collect this rice
 sthaneey nivasee hemanth raut kehete hai
 “it has been almost 50 years while protecting and preserving this forest
 jin 40,000 pedo ko kaat diya gaya
 More than three thousand people depended on it
 haalanki forest rhite act (ekaare)2006 ke tahat in logon ne apana daawa is jangal par ab tak nahin kiya he
 In such a situation, their claim becomes irrelevant
 lekin yah act yah bhi kahata he ki agar kisi van bhoomi par kuch log nirbhar karte hai yaa is par daawa thokate hai to van vibhaag in logon ko jaankaree de ki kaise is par kanoonee rup se daawa kiya ja saktaa he
 But if local people believe, then this kind of awareness campaign or no official advised them here
 sthaneey log kehete hai, jab dashakon se ham is bhoomi ko bachaate or isse apana jivan chalaate aae hai to sarkaar yah jameen kaise le sakati he?haalanki panchayat anusuchit kshetron main vistaar,1996 (pasa) act ke tahat van yogya bhoomi kaa patta dete vakt yaa phir sarkari istemaal ke liye ise anumati dene par us jangal kii aabaadi se raishumaari kerani padati he
 But the locals say that even though the administration paper shows that they have taken consent from the local people, it is a sheer lie
 ab gaanvvasi is aadhaar par court jane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 It was just a matter of giving the lease of mining without the consent of the gram sabha to the Adani group on the Bailadila mountain in Chhattisgarh that now the charge of giving the forest land to the Adani group in Odisha without consent from the gram sabha has raised the question whether the government PESA wants to deprive forest dwellers of the right to forest land by tampering with the law
 odisha ke jharsuguda jile ke patrapalli gaanv main bhi ped kaatane kii hui koshishapatrapalli gaanv main bhi 11 disambar ko police ke saath kuch logon ne ped kaatane kii koshish kii
 But the local residents chased them away
 patrapalli gaanv vahi he jahaan rajya kii mashhoor mahanadi par hirakund baandh banane ke baad yahaan se visthapit hue log is gaanv main sharan ke liye pahunche the

 We are conscious of this and are concerned about it
 'vahiin, hind mahaasaagar main china ke badhate dakhal ke sandarbh main unhone kaha ki nai dilli ise lekar bahut chintit nahin he
 His reaction comes last week at the opening of a new embassy in Beijing by the Beijing-based South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) conference
 antni ne kaha, 'aap kisi bhi desh ko duniya ke kisi anya desh main duutavas kholane yaa usase sambandh pragadh karne se kaise roak sakate hai? ham bhi prayek desh main duutavas sthapit kar rahe hai or unase sambandh bana rahe hai
 'he said,' India is also expanding its military capabilities and building infrastructure in the eastern region
 lekin yah kisi desh ke saath sangharsh ke liye nahin, balki purvi kshetra main apane bhubhag ko bachaane ke liye he
 We will strengthen the eastern region
 'china ke saath dwipaksheeya raksha sambandhon ko lekar antni ne sakaaratmak pratikriya jataai or kaha ki raksha sachiv shashikant sharma agle saal apane chini samakaksh se baatcheet karenge, jabaki donon deshon ke bich seemaa prabandhan tantra is saal ke aakhir main astitv main aayega

 hamane koi atirikt sahaayta kii maang nahin kii he kyonki hamen lagata he ki pienbi ke paas puunji jutaney kii kshamta he
 Explaining this in detail, Mehta said, "PNB raised capital of roughly Rs 12,000 crore in September in the last financial year
 ’’ tippaniyan Of this, Rs 5,000 crore was raised through eligible institutional planning, Rs 1,300 crore by selling stake in PNB Housing Finance and Rs 5,400 crore through government capital

 maharashtra ke nagpur main ek sthaneey adaalat ne danta chikitsa kii padhai kar rahi ek yuvati ko nashila padaarth khilaakar uskaa ek ashleel video banane or use fasebuk par aplod karne par ek vyakti ko paanch saal ke karawas kii sajaa sunai he
 Actually, this is the case of 2012
 jab yahaan kampti nivasee aaropee ajay shalikram gajabhiye ne badale kii karrwai ke tahat shahar ke ek dental kalege kii chaatra kaa ashleel video banakarfesabukapar aplod kar diya tha
 After this incident, a complaint was lodged against the medical representative accused Ajay by profession
 haal hi main soochna praudyogiki kanoon, 2010 kii dhara 66e, 66si, 66di or 67e ke tahat aaropee ajay ko doshi paaya gaya
 According to the information, accused Ajay came in contact with this student during his college days in 2010 and soon the two became friends
 baad main donon ke sambandhon main kisi baat ko lekar katutaa aa gai or ladki ne ajay se milanaa band kar diya tha
 In December 2011, Ajay forcibly took the girl to a resort and found her intoxicated, drinking soft drinks and taking her videos in an objectionable condition
 iske baad usne ladki se najdiki badhaane kii koshish kii, lekin jab usne inkaar kiya to aaropee ne use vah video dikhaakar blackmel karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Even after this, when the girl did not listen to Ajay, she somehow acquired the girl's Facebook password and uploaded the video clip to Facebook through her
 saath hi aaropee ne wo ashleel video ladki ke doston or rishtedaaron ko bhi bhej diya tha
 During the investigation in this regard, the cybercrime cell came to know that the pornographic video was uploaded from Ajay Shalikram Gajbhiye's computer

 'ham tum or trek' se ek anshkhilne waalon main ek ganit ke adhyaaapak liu tyang-guang the—nate insaan jinka munh ascharyajanak rup se badha tha
 We had heard that he could clench his fist in his mouth, although none of us had seen him doing so
 unki ek darshneey chhavi, jo aksar mere mastishk main kaundhti rahati thi, manch par khadey, khule munh se jamhai lene vaali thi
 One of his names was 'hippo'
 ab hamamen se kisi ne ye jeev dekha nahin tha, jise chini bhashaa main ‘hema’ kehete hai jo sunne main kuch-kuch ‘hama’ lagata he- mendhak kii ek aisi prajati jiskaa munh bahut bada hota he
 So it was only natural that we started calling them frogs liu
 yah meraa avishkaar nahin tha, par poochhtacha ke baad liu massahab ne ye tay kar liya tha ki ye meri hi carguzari thi
 Naming the son of a martyr as a frog liu, the vice-chairman of the school's revolutionary committee, was such a heinous crime, for which it was logical and inevitable for me to be expelled from the school and thrown out of the school yard
 is sari bakbak kaa makasad he aage aane vaale naatakeey drishy ke liye manch taiyaar karnaa: apana munh khol liu master ne top spin lagaate gend uchhaali jise vinley ne sidhe-sidhe lautaa diya par maano vah chamakili gend apni ankhon se raah dekhati, sidhe khule munh main ja ghusi
 We were also shocked
 phir hansi kaa fawwara chuta
 The face of a teacher named Ma, who was already red
 ab murge kii kalgi kii tarah surkh ho gaya
 Wenley, who had hung his mouth, chirped loudly
 main hi akelaa tha, jo hansaa nahin
 Amaze kept on seeing what happened
 i remembered a story i heard from the village's grandfather, Wang Gui
 jab ek baar jiyang jiya naam kaa bekaar ishaan aataa bech rahaa tha
 a gust of wind shone it with his hand
 phir usne koyala bechney kii koshish kii
 But this time there was no winter
 jab usne aasmaan kii ore dekhte aah bhari to chidiya uske munh main beet kar gai
 Twenty years later in the fall of 1999, when i was going from the metro to the newspaper office, the newspaper seller caught my attention: 'read! Read! The great wonder of the Great War - the ammunition fired from the Soviet cannon directly into the cord of the German cannon! ' i suddenly remember the day when Wenli's pingpong ball hit Liu Massab's mouth
 iske baad jo hua, usase sabko laga ki unhen hansanaa nahin chahie
 Suddenly everyone became silent
 aap soch rahen honge ki liu ne gend thookkar ugal di hogi or kuch mazaakia chutki lee hogi—vah vinodi swabhaav ke the—vinley ne sharmindagi mahasoos karte hue maafi maangi hogi
 But you would think it wrong
 gend thukne kii jagah liu ne apni gardan khinchi, ankhen or bhi failaa leen or gend nigalane kii koshish kii—ham sabane yah dekha
 Then he licked his hands and let out a wheezing sound from the throat
 vah us chuje jaisaa nazar aa rahaa tha, jisane koi zaharila keedaa nigal liya ho
 We stood helpless with dismay
 sirf adhyaaapak jhang ko chhodkar
 Joe runs over to Liu and slaps him on the back
 phir yu naam ke dusre adhyaaapak daudkar liu ke paas pahunche or unhone apane haath unki gardan ke neeche daal die
 Wang, a right-wing teacher, was a medical college graduate and knew what to do
 vah daudkar aae unhone jhang or yu ko dhakiyakar hataaya
 Wrapped his boner-like long arms around Liu's waist and jerked the middle part of the body with his hands
 gend liu ke munh se chatak udati hui mez par ja giri, jahaan usne do-chaar tappe khaae or zamin par girakar bina ek inch ludhake chipak si gai
 Wang left Liu, who crumbled as if made of mud, with a choking scream
 lu vinley ne apana balla mez par phenk diya, apana cheharaa hatheliyon main chipa liya or roti hui bhaag nikali
 Wang massaged Masab lying on the ground until he stood up with support
 jaise hi vah khadey ho sake unhone ird-gird nigahen daudai or bhari gale se kaha: ‘kahaan he lu vinley? us shaitan ne to mujhe maar hi daalaa tha !’ Salman Khan is known as Dabang Khan of Bollywood

 seva main,thanadhyaksh,lanka varanasi,vaaya chif procter biechayu varanasi,mahoday,main praarthi biene dwitiya varsh( vyavhaarik kala vibhaag) 6:20 PM bharat kala bhawan se guzar rahi thi
 i was wearing a salwar shoot
 achaanak se do bike savaar mere paas aaye or apana haath mere shoot ke andar daal die or bike tej karke chale gaye
 Due to the lack of light, i could not even see their vehicle number
 main chillaai thi, vahaan ke guard chauraahey par the
 But nothing helped me
 main rote hue vahaan se apane doston ke paas gai
 Who brought me to the hostel in a state of unconsciousness
 phir ve guard se baat karne gaye
 Then no strict action was taken on the occasion
 unka kahana tha ki hamane to kuch dekha hi nahin
 The girl wept in front, but she did not tell anything
 galati tum ladakiyon kii he
 Who says to get out after 6 o'clock
 is vaardaat ke baavjood ve vahaan khadey muskura rahe the
 While this incident took place at a distance of only ten meters from them
 is ghatana ko hote hue ek ladke ne dekha tha
 He identified that the boy behind was wearing a white and red shirt
 jabaki hamaare surakshakarmiyon ne is baat ko nazarandaaj kar diya
 In this context, strict action should be taken so that such misbehavior does not happen to anyone
 jaanch ke aadeshchhedchhad kii shikaar is ladki kaa naam ham nahin likh rahe, lekin apni is FIR main wo sabakuch bayaan kar gai jo uske saath gujri thi
 The victim girl, however, has left the hostel and gone to her home
 lekin is ghatana ne banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ko jhakzor diya he
 Alam yeh hai Yogi Sarkar is on the backfoot and is talking about all the investigations
 mukhyamantri yogi ne bhi apni chuppi todi or tabadatod kai faisle bhi liye, lekin sarkaar ko lag rahaa he ki biechayu cond unke gale kii fans banataa ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the Vice Chancellor Girish Chandra Tripathi has been arrested in the case of lathi charge on girl students in Banaras Hindu University

 On the other hand, Chief Proctor Omkarnath Singh of the University has offered to resign his post taking moral responsibility for this entire matter
 videsh mantri es jaishankar ne bada bayaan dete hue kaha he ki pakistan ke kabje vaala kashmir (pioke) bharat kaa hissaa he or ummid karte hai ki ek din bharat ke bhautik adhikaar kshetra main hoga
 The External Affairs Minister also said that after a border there is no need to worry about what people will say on Kashmir because it is India's internal matter and India's position in its internal affairs has been strong and will remain strong

 But he has a different challenge from a neighbor and it will remain a challenge until he behaves normally and takes action against cross-border terrorism
 apane 75 minute ke samvaadadaata sammelan main jaishankar ne bharat ke duusare deshon ke saath sambandh, america ke saath ranneetik sambandhon or china ke saath rishton or vaishvik manch par bharat kii haisiyat samet vibhinn muddon par baat rakhi
 The External Affairs Minister made it clear to Pakistan that the issue is not about Article 370 but the issue is of cross-border terrorism and that the first topic on the negotiating table for any kind of dialogue will be terrorism
 kuch kendriya mantriyon ke is bayaan ke bare main puche jane par ki ab vaarta sirf pioke par hogi, na ki kashmir par to unhone kaha ki pioke par hamaara rukh rahaa he or hameshaa rahegaa ki yah bharat kaa hissaa he or ham ummid karte hai ki ek din yah hamaare bhautik adhikaar kshetra main hoga
 Significantly, the government has been saying that talks with Pakistan will now be on pok and not on Kashmir
 aisa bayaan uparashtrapati em venkaiya naidu, raksha mantri rajnath singh, kendriya mantri jitendra singh aadi bhi pehle de chuke hai
 In response to a question about some countries and human rights organizations expressing concern over the situation in Kashmir, Jaishankar said that internationally people understand what was India's reason for abolishing Article 370
 unhone kaha ki yah asthaayee praavdhaan tha jiskaa ghatnakramon ke vishleshan main upyog nahin hota he
 This provision has actually become inactive
 iskaa istemaal kuch log apane phaayde ke liye kar rahe the
 This was hampering development and promoting separatism
 algaavvaad kaa istemaal pakistan seemaa paar aatankwaad ke liye kar rahaa tha
 Jaishankar said that Article 370 is not a bilateral issue, it is our internal matter
 unhone kaha ki unhen lagata he antarrashtriya samudaay anuchhed 370 par hamaari sthiti ko samajhataa he
 The Foreign Minister said that after a border there is no need to worry about what people will say on Kashmir
 unhone jor diya ki aantarik maamalon par bharat ke rukh ko mana gaya he or mana jaayegaa
 Jaishankar said that since 1972, India's position is clear and there is no change in it

 One refers to India in relation to IT professionals, while the other refers to Pakistan
 bharat se baatcheet karne kaa koi matlab nahin hone sambandhi pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kii tippanee ke bare main puche jane par videsh mantri ne kaha ki pakistan kii samasya yah he ki vah aatankwaad par keval baat karata he, karata kuch nahin he
 He said that tell me one such country whose neighboring country openly promotes terrorism against him and then he talks with it
 jaishankar ne yah bhi kaha ki seemaa paar se hone vaale aatankwaad, anuchhed 370 ko hathaaye jane jaise mudde par bharat ke paksh se vaishvik jagat ko avgat karaayaa gaya
 He said that India's position in its internal affairs has been strong and will remain strong

 He said that there is a very strong relationship between domestic and foreign policy
 hamaare rashtriya niti lakshyon or videsh niti ke lakshyon ke bich kaa sambandh majboot ho gaya he
 Referring to SAARC, an organization of South Asian countries, Jaishankar said that our message about SAARC is that for the future of the group, we need businesses which are based on special status, need of connectivity and need for terrorism-free environment
 is
 unhone kaha ki bharat or america ke sambandhon main aisa koi kshetra nahin he, jahaan aage kii disha main nahin pragati nahin hui ho or donon deshon ke sambandh kaaphi behatar sthiti main hai
 In response to a question about commerce between the two countries, Jaishankar said that the business problem between the two countries is 'normal'
 unhone kaha ki ek hi rasta he jab kaarobaar samasya nahin hogi, jab ham koi kaarobaar nahin karen
 In such a situation, the business problem is common between the two countries

 Conscious people in Mumbai are installing eco-friendly Ganpati idols
 The 22-foot tall statue of Ganapati being made of paper and clay in Lalbagh
 The sculptures from Plaster of Paris do not dissolve in the ocean due to chemicals
 At a time when the festival is getting bigger every year, Concerns about pollution in the environment are also increasing
 vishaal ganpati murtiyon sthapit karne or adhik se adhik bheed ko aakarshith karne ke liye mandalon main hode bhi badhati ja rahi he
 Mostly these sculptures are made of plaster of Paris
 utsav ke akhir main sabhi ganpati murtiyon ko arab sagar main visarjeet kar diya jaataa he
 However there are people and some mandals in Mumbai who are environmentally aware and they are installing eco friendly Ganpati idols
 india today aisi workshop par pahunchaa jahaan murtiyon ko kaagaj se banaaya ja rahaa he
 There is a famous mandal in Lalbagh which is making a huge 22 feet tall idol of Ganapati with paper and clay
 mumbai main do hajaar se adhik panjikrut ganpati mandal hai
 But when it comes to houses and other places where Ganapati is established, this number becomes very large
 lekin biemasi kii ore se jo paryaavaran ke anukool visarjan sthal nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai unhen lekar logon main kam hi jaagrukta he
 However, most of Ganpati's sculptures are huge and cannot be immersed in environmentally friendly small ponds
 isliye zyaadaatar ganpati murtiyon ko arab sagar main visarjeet kiya jaataa he
 Sculptures made of plaster of Paris and painted do not dissolve in the ocean due to chemicals
 arab sagar maharashtra ke liye samudri bhojan kaa pramukh strot he
 Talking about last year, on the seventh day of Ganapati immersion, many fish, water snakes and turtles were seen dead on the beaches of Mumbai
 samudri visheshgyon ke mutabik in jeevon kaa maranaa aise rasayanon ke sharir main pahunchane kii vajah se hua jisase saans lenaa band ho jaataa he
 Not only this, the parts of the Ganapati idols which do not get back, they come back to the beach
 ye drishy logon kii bhaawanaaon ko aahat karata he
 In Matunga the idol maker Sagar Chitle makes Ganapati sculptures out of paper
 sagar chitale ne bataaya, “yah lambii prakriya he
 After the Navratri festival was over, i started making sculptures
 kaagaj se bani iko friendli murtiyon kii keemat plaster of paris kii tulana main adhik he lekin agar kisi ko paryaavaran ko bachaana he to yah keemat kuch bhi nahin he
 The good is that people are becoming aware and there is a huge demand for paper Ganpati
 vishaal ganpati murtiyon bhi kaagaj kii bani ho sakati hai or ve paryaavaran ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaati hai
 The ornamented part of the idols is also made of paper
 ham keelon kaa istemaal bhi nahin karte hai or isaki jagah gond or choti lakdi kaa istemaal karte hai
 The government should also help in this initiative and provide space for making such statues
 ”india today iske baad lalbaag main tejukaya ganpati mandal pahunchaa
 It is famous for the huge Ganpati idol
 is saal bhi ye mandal vishaal ganpati murti sthapit kar rahaa he, lekin is baar yah kaagaj or mitti se bani hogi
 This Ganpati idol is 22 feet high and eco friendly
 yahi nahin, is baar ye mandal thermokol yaa plastic kaa bhi istemaal nahin kar rahe hai
 The decoration is also being done with paper and cotton
 asal main mandal kii ore se shraddhaluon se apil kii ja rahi he ki ve murti ke liye agarbatti or phool naa laaen balki pencil, kalam, notebook or aisi anya upyogi chizein laaen jo kolhapur or sangli ke baadh prabhavit kshetron ko daan kii ja saken
 This mandal, now in its 53rd year, considers the environment to be the need of the hour
 rishwat lene ke aarope main sibiai kii hiraasat main chal rahe purv vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram was again presented in the Patiala House Court in Delhi today
 jahaan sunwaayee ke baad court ne unhen 12 din kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhejne kaa aadesh diya
 Now his next appearance will be on March 24
 isse pehle sunwaayee ke dauraan sibiai ne karti kii remand badhaane kii maang nahin kii thi
 As a result, Karthi's lawyer appealed for immediate bail
 saath hi karti ke vakil ne ye bhi maang kii thi ki agar unhen jail bheje jane par alag kothri or vishesh suraksha kaa intjaam kiya jaae

 The report states that governments around the world keep cyber troupes with them, which use other media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter to create public opinion and spread misinformation
 ye report uniwarsity of oxford se ai he
 According to Bloomberg news, governments use online tools to influence politics and are paid by governments
 researchrs ne paaya ki 29 desh, gharelu str par yaa bahari desh ke logon ke bich opinian ko aakaar dene ke liye soshal media tul kaa istemaal karti hai

 i don't think people would know how many governments use these means to reach them

 In the last few years, governments have started learning and working with activists
 jis tarah activist jaankaree failaane ke liye soshal media kaa istemaal karti hai usee tarah sarkarein bhi karne lagi hai
 It can be feared from this report that India too will not be untouched by this tactic of misleading people on social media by political parties
 tamaam tarah ke post roj hi saamne aati hai

 In Tamil Nadu, there was an atmosphere of political upheaval, when on February 7-8, the Narendra Modi government launched the vaccine called rubella in five states Puducherry, Goa, Lakshadweep, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu in its special vaccination program
 lekin achaanak tamilnadu main soshal media ke jariye faili ek afvaah—rubella kaa tikaa aresas ne banwaaya he jo musalmaan bacchon ko napunsak bana degaa—kendriya swasthya mantralay ke haath-paanv phulane ke liye kaaphi thi
 The rumor also weakened after a month of political instability ended
 lekin isse teen hafte kaa abhiyaan puraa karne main chah haftaa lag gaya or uskaa said effect haryana ke muslim bahul mevaat main is kadar padaa ki routine tikaakaran kaarykram bhi thap ho gaya
 Partially the vaccination campaign has resumed after mutual interaction between the district administration and Muslim leaders
 lekin mantralay ke ek adhikari hairaangi jataate hai, ''aresas ke naam se rubella tike ke bare main afvaah failaa di gai, lekin achraj kii baat he ki tikaakaran main nae tike ko jodgaye kaa sabase zyada virodh aresas kaa hi aanushanbik sanghathan swadeshi jaagran manch kar rahaa he
 "despite two-fours of such problems and controversies, the Union Health Ministry is executing its program
 rubella jo aam taur par khasra jaisi hi beemaari se bachaav ke liye diya jaataa he, kaa garbhvatee mahilaon par zyada prabhaav hota he
 Children born in it have many types of pathologies
 abhiyaan ke tahat 9 maheene se 15 saal tak ke bacchon ko shaamil kiya gaya or mantralay kaa daawa he ki nirdhaarit 3
 The target of reaching 6 crore children has been achieved 95 percent
 lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tikaa har bachche tak pahunchane kii doorgaami soch ko saakaar karne main mishan indradhanush ek mahatvapurn upkaran ke taur par ubhara he
 Due to which the reach of vaccination increased from 64 to 70 in just two rounds
 8 fisadi tak pahunch gaya he
 According to data from the Integrated Child Health and Immunization Survey (inchiz), the vaccination rate in rural areas has jumped by 9 percent
 tikaakaranh jaruri banaam bhrantitikaakaran ko lekar bhale bhrantiyaan hon, lekin bharat ke mahapanjiyak ke aankadon ke mutabik, paidaa hone vaale ek hajaar bacchon main se 43 apana 5waan to 37 pehla janmdin bhi nahin manaa pate
 According to 2015 data, about 2 every year
 66 karod bachche paidaa hote hai jinamein se 11 lakh bacchon kii mrityu ho jaati he, jabaki usase do saal pehle yah aankada 14 lakh ke kareeb tha
 There was no organized vaccination program in the country until the 1970s
 1985 main sarkaar ne universal immunijeshan program shuru kiya to ek saal tak ke bachche par hi focus tha
 In 1986 it was placed on a twenty point program and from 1990 a nationwide campaign began
 2002 tak isamen sirf chah tike shaamil the jisaki sankhya dhire-dhire badhkar 11 tak pahunch gai he
 To reduce infant mortality rate, the central government is working towards complete immunization
 lekin uski mushkil yah he ki ek-tihaai bachche is abhiyaan main isliye chhot jate hai kyonki unhen tikaakaran ke phaayde kii samaj nahin he to ek-tihaai bachche tike ke baad hone vaali swaabhaavik pareshaaniyaan—bukhaar aana, bachche kaa ronaa or yatra main hona aadi bhi abhibhavakon ko rokatii he jabaki baaki ek-tihaai main 8-10 kii fisadi kami eenem ke durgam kshetron main nahin pahunchane se hoti he

 Mishra proposed Mission Indradhanush to add children left out or deprived due to some reasons in routine vaccination
 lekin yah saakaar hua jagat prakaash nadda ke swasthya vibhaag kaa mantri banane ke baad
 Taking this campaign privately, Mishra argued to the minister that despite government spending, the death rate was not declining because 2
 66 karod main se 91 lakh bachche routine tikaakaran abhiyaan se chute hue hai
 So they should run a special campaign to connect
 march 2015 ko ise mishan mod main 201 jilon ko shaamil kiya gaya jahaan routine tikaakaran kii pahunch 50 fisadi se kam thi
 The fifth round of the mission is currently underway, but its impact is clearly visible in the available data of two rounds
 (dekhen graphic) haalanki mishra maanate hai ki is vishesh abhiyaan ke baad agar bacchon ko routine tikaakaran main nahin laa paae to iskaa koi phayda nahin hoga, lihaaja sarkaar kaa focus abhiyaan ke saath-saath nirantar nigaraanee par bhi he
 Why is there a ruckus? The central government, which has pushed forward the barbarishan rainbow, was accused of working under the influence of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
 yah aarope sangh kaa sanghathan swadeshi jaagran manch hi laga rahaa tha
 The reason for this was the Immunization Technical Support Unit (ITSU), formed to support the National Technical Advisory Group of Immunization (natagi), the highest technical institution of the Ministry of Immunization
 jiske 32 karmchaariyon kii niyukti main gates foundation kii bhoomika he
 The foundation, however, denied this on India Today's question
 lekin foundation ne mana tha ki 2013 main usne public health foundation of india (piechaephai) ko itsu sthapit karne ke liye anudaan diya tha
 After this dispute, the Ministry held a high-level meeting and ordered the PHFI to return in November 2016 and since last month the work has now been handed over to the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, the department of the Ministry
 is kadam kii pushti karte hue mantralay main sanyukt sachiv vandana gurnani or disi haldaar kehete hai ki tikaakaran ke abhiyaan main koi baadha na rahe, iske liye mantralay patibaddh he
 Although Swadeshi Jagran Manch's national co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan dismisses the allegations of being anti-vaccination, "we are as much pro-vaccine as pro-antibiotic
" ham andhadhundh tikaa lagane ke paksh main nahin hai, bina matlab kaa tikaa lagane kaa matlab companiyon ko phayda pahunchaana bhi ho saktaa he
 Therefore, vaccination should be taken keeping in mind the experience of the world and the need of the country
 "ve kehete hai ki manch ne kabhi polia yaa deepiti kaa virodh nahin kiya
 However, some officials of the ministry say that when the same vaccine has been available in private for years, why does no one oppose it

 arvind kanchan kehete hai, ''jis beemaari kaa ham ilaaj nahin kar sakate use thaamne ke liye tikaakaran behatar upaay he
 "there is a general consensus on vaccination, but technical aspects and ethical questions often arise

 samasya itani bhar nahin he
 Giving ration to many people has been stopped simply because they are baseless
 gramin ilaakon main logon ko aadhaar ke bina suvidhaayen diya janaa band kar diya gaya he

 For this problem, Sumit Singh, Senior Executive Officer posted in Jhansi, says, problems are being faced with the Aadhaar card every day

 The finger print problem is more acute for those whose Aadhaar card has been made for three years

 vahiin, sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki jiesti se companiyon ko lagbhag 14 billian dollar kii bachat hogi kyonki isse unhen apane warehouse or aapurti shrinkhalaa ko or daksh banane kii jarurat hogi
 Companies will now be able to operate centrally instead of operating state by state
 jaankaron kii maane to jiesti kaa asangathit kshetra par vipareet asar pad saktaa he kyonki zyaadaatar asangathit kshetra kii zyaadaatar ikaiyaan tex system main register nahin hai
 At the same time, the government believes that GST will save companies around $ 14 billion as it will require them to make their warehouse and supply chain more efficient
 companiyaan ab rajya dar rajya parichaalan karne ke bajaay kendriya rup se kaam kar sakenge
 According to experts, GST can have an adverse effect on the unorganized sector as most of the units in the unorganized sector are not registered in the tax system

 The entire execution was given the code named 'operation Three Star'

 Tihar Jail officials said on Monday that Afzal Guru, convicted in the 2001 Parliament attack case, was told on the evening of February 8 that he would be hanged the next day under the name 'operation Three Star' code

 The jail superintendent gave him pen and paper
 ’adhikari ne bataaya, ‘usne urdu main khat likhaa jise kashmir main rah rahe parivaar ke pate par usee din bhej diya gaya
 When questioned about the letter from his family living in Sopore in the valley, he said that he has not received the letter yet
 afjal guru ke chachere bhai yaccin guru ne bataaya, ‘hamen abhi tak khat nahin mila he

 An official said, 'the information about this decision was given only to a select few officers

 Hello, i am Ravish Kumar
 
 
 is baar koun jitegaa? vahi jitegaa, to kitne se jitegaa
 
 
 Will he win anywhere? survey bhi kah rahaa he
 It is not known kahin survey galat to nahin kah rahaa he? pichhlaa survey to sahi tha, lekin usase pehle vaala survey galat tha
 When the election comes, these kinds of things become the food of the world of discussion-e-chakallas
 opinian pole hameshaa se sandigdh rahaa he, vivaadaaspad rahaa he
 Just as the question of the validity and morality of a sting operation hangs in the form of a long-term question, the question of restricting opinion polls cannot be a short-objective question
 mangalvaar ko news express naamak news channel ne ek sting kar yah bataaya ki kis tarah se kuch le-dekar survey karne kii company siton main ghat-bad kar detii he
 According to Sting News Express, there are 11 companies that were found to be manipulating the results
 survey karne vaali companiyaan aam taur par kami-basi hone ke liye teen pratishat kaa margin lekar chalati hai, magar sting ke anusaar si voter ke adhikari ise teen se badhaakar paanch pratishat tak karne ko taiyaar dikh rahe the
 We are not able to test the veracity of this sting, so cannot claim it like News Express
 na hin hamaare paas sting main shaamil sabhi companiyon ke paksh hai
 It is important to take care of all these things, so that the habit of formalism of balance remains
 vaise si voter ke yashavanth deshmukh ne kaha ki unhone news express channel ke liye bhi survey kiye hai
 He is proud of his team
 teen se paanch pratishat ke margin ko yun samajhie ki itnaa pratishat kisi ke paksh main swing ho gaya, to survey main uski hawa, phir aandhi or phir lahar dikhne lagegi
 Where there is a win-win with a difference of 10 thousand to five thousand, this margin is dangerous
 vah bhi paisa dekar
 There is no complete study that you vote only after being influenced by the survey
 zyaadaatar baaten andaaji takkar hai
 If the survey has gone wrong, it also means that you are not very much affected by the survey
 aaj aam aadmi party ne opinian pole kii vaidhata par sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki desh main raajnneetik shadyantra chal rahaa he
 Arvind Kejriwal said that in the Delhi elections, how did the BJP get first 20, then 30 and 40 seats by the time elections came
 yahi kaam loksabhaa chunaav ke samay ho rahaa he
 Every week BJP will first come to 160, then 190 and everyone knows that it will be taken to 280 by the time elections come
 or 280 par dikhaaya jayega ki desh ke andar modi ji kii sarkaar ban rahi he
 One question arises that how many surveys are done in the entire country within a week
 yogendra yadav ne pratibandh kii baat nahin kahi, lekin paardarshita kii vakaalat kii
 Congress leader Ajay Maken and Legal Cell President Casey Mittal also met the Election Commission today and said that opinion polls should be banned
 kejariwal ab modi or bhartiya janata party se puch rahe hai ki kis channel ko kitne paise baante or kis pole agency ko kitne paise baante, isaki esaiti banaakar jaanch honi chahie
 Ajay Maken of Congress is saying that black money is being seen in the opinion poll
 vaise isi 23 farvari ko hindustan times main harinder baveja kii khabar chhapi he ki rahul gandhi apane ummidavaaron kii lokapriyata kaa pataa lagane ke liye survey kara rahe hai
 Be Serious This is prime time
 aaj hi mukhya chunaav ayukta kaa bayaan aayaa he ki ayog ne to 10 saal pehle 2004 main sarvadaleey baithak main yah suzav diya tha
 The government has to decide
 isi janvari main times aaf india kii khabar he ki sarkaar opinayan pole par pratibandh lagane par soch rahi he
 She kept thinking
 yah dhyaan main rakhiye ki 2009 main sansad ne kanoon banaakar matdaan ke sabhi charnon ke puraa hone se pehle agsit pole dikhaane par bain kiya he
 The Commission argues that political parties and leaders have their own channels across India including South India
 kya inkaa opinian pole tatasth ho saktaa he? kya koi paise or prabhaav ke dam par survey dikhaakar gumraah nahin kar saktaa? pichley saal aktabur main inhen sab sawaalon ko lekar chunaav ayog ne tamaam dalon ko likhaa tha, lekin kuch nahin hua
 The government was waiting for a sting, so that every survey could be targeted against Narendra Modi and the BJP
 opinian pole ke bare main bijepi kii raay pratibandh karne kii nahin he
 Surveys have also gone wrong against BJP
 2004 ke tamaam survey main badhat ke baad bhi atal ji chunaav haar gaye the
 Narendra Modi's statement appeared in the Times of India on November 4, 2013, that banning the survey is a violation of fundamental rights
 unka kahana tha ki main inaki simaaon se avgat hum
 Opinion polls in 2002 showed that the BJP government would not form in Gujarat
 opinian pole kaa mix ricard rahaa he
 It depends on the political parties what we do

 When it comes to his sisters, Arjun does not miss to express his displeasure openly
 haal hi main ek online portal ne jahnavi kapur kii dress par trol kiye jane kii khabar kar di
 Seeing the headline of the news, Arjun's anger got fiercely on social media
 unhone likhaa do trols ne photo ke bare main likhaa or aapane use badi khabar bana diya
 It is shameful how the media is promoting the trolls
 2 trolls write a comment n for the web team of a big newspaper it’s a news story
 
 
 slow clap 👏 ridiculous how trolls are given attention by the media & they wait for us to retaliate
 
 
 the lesser the stories the lesser the trolls win
 
 
 - Arjun Kapoor (@ arjunk26) June 5, 2018 Arjunbata Dey was recently spotted at a cafe in Mumbai with Ishaan Khattar, fueled by lewd comments on Sister Jahnavi's dress
 jahnavi ne short van pis dress pahani hui thi
 After which an online portal made news saying that Jahnavi might have forgotten to wear something
 aisa pehali baar nahin hua he jab apni family ke khilaaf bole jane par arjuna kapur kaa gussa dekha gaya ho
 He had given a befitting reply when trolled on Jahnavi's dress even earlier
 unhone twit kiya- ye sharmnaak he ki aapaki ankhen yahi sab dekhati hai
 This is how our country sees a young woman
 yah bahut sharmnaak he
 Arjun Kapoor is shooting Namastey England these days
 is film main unke saath pariniti chopra najar aaengi
 While the shoot of Jahnavi's film Dhadak is nearing completion, his photoshoot recently went viral
 film 'bhootnath riterns' sikwel he or isaki kahani vahiin se shuru hoti he, jahaan pehali film 'bhootnath' khatm hui thi
 
 
 When Bhoothnath reaches his world after attaining salvation, he is mocked for not being able to scare anyone
 
 
 isliye bhootnath dobaaraa duniya main aate hai, taaki bacchon ko daraa saken, or utarate hai mumbai kii sabase bade jhuggi-jhonpadi vaale ilaake dharavi main
 
 
 By the way, even though he failed to scare this time, he fought against evil, and fought elections with a child
 
 
 bhootnath apane-aap main aisa bhoot he, jisase darshak darate nahin, pyaar karte hai or pehali film kii safalataa is baat kii gavaah he
 
 
 It is a comedy, which jokes a lot
 
 
 'bhootnath riterns' main dikhaaya gaya he ki kis tarah netaa galat tareekon se chunaav ladate hai, kis tarah bhrashtachar desh ko kha rahaa he, or kis tarah sarkari mashinari bina rishwat kaam nahin karti
 
 
 Even in 'bhootnath Returns' it has been very cleverly told that due to the poor attitude of the system, the ghost can also contest
 
 
 'bhootnath riterns' ke dialogs achche hai, jo kabhi hansaate hai, kabhi desh ke system par tanj kasate hai
 
 
 Not only are the roles of Amitabh Bachchan and Boman Irani, Parth Bhalerao has played the character of a kid named 'walnut'
 
 
 diarector nitesh tiwari ne kahani ko sundarataa se parde par utaara he
 
 
 The first half of the film is particularly good and full of comedy, but in the second half the film became somewhat serious, so the film seems to be a bit too long
 
 
 haalanki film ne apni pakad nahin chodi, magar pehle hisse kii tarah duusare hisse kii kahani ko bhi thode or halke-phulke andaaz main kaha jaataa, to shaayad film zyaada manoranjak hoti
 
 
 Overall, 'bhootnath Returns' is not only entertaining, but in this election environment, it also sends a message to the audience that they must vote, because the vote is your voice
 
 
 is film ke liye meri reating he - 3
 5 stars
 
 
 jediu netaa kasee tyaagi ne vishwa yoga diwas par amit shah ke bihar aane par roak lagane kii maang kii he
 He has written a letter to the Election Commission, demanding a ban on Shah from attending the Yoga Day program in Patna
 darasal bihar main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 In view of this, Tyagi has written to the Election Commission that BJP leaders are coming to campaign through Yoga Day
 unhone apni chitthee main likhaa he ki aayush mantralay dwaara vishwa yoga diwas manaanaa swaagatyogy kadam he, lekin is kaarykram kii shuruyaat pradhanmantri ke bhaashan se hogi
 He has described it as a malicious attempt to woo voters
 unhone chunaav ayog ko likhi chitthee main aachaar samhita kii duhai dete hue guhaar lagaai he ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko patna aane se roka jaae
 Tyagi said that through the program of Kiog Day, BJP wants to trap voters
 unhonabijepike tamaam mantriyon ke yoga diwas par hone vaale kaaryakramon main bhaag lene se roak lagane kii maang kii he
 On the one hand, the Modi government does not want to give up any core efforts to make the World Yoga Day program grand, on the other hand it has also faced opposition from the opposition
 congress ke varisht netaa digvijay singh ne bhi shanivaar ko hi kaha ki pradhanmantri yoga diwas ke madhyam se apana mahimamandan kar rahe hai
 In Delhi, it is ready to give a simple electoral contest
 vidhansabha chunaav ke liye ulti ginati shuru ho gai he
 The campaign for the election came to a halt at 6 pm on Thursday
 yahaan kii 70 sadasyeey vidhansabha ke liye 7 taarikh yani shanivaar ko vot daale jaaenge
 1 close to the national capital
 3 karod matadaata 673 pratyaashiyon kii kismat kaa faisla iviem main darj karenge
 Voting will be on Saturday from 8 am to 6 pm
 chunaav nateezon kaa elaan 10 farvari ko kiya jayega
 The election is a contest between the three main parties - Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress and all three have campaigned vigorously to woo the voters
 chunaav ayog ke nirdeshon ke mutabik, sabhi partiyon ne shaam 6 baje prachaar khatm kar diya
 That is, there will be no party rally or publicity through radio or television
 haalanki ummidavaar ghar-ghar jaakar vot maang sakenge
 On the last day, as soon as the publicity was over, the mobile SMS containing the vote appeal sent by the parties was also stopped
 idhar, prachaar ke aakhri din AAP or bijepi ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaaron ne apni jansabhaon ko sambodhit kiya
 AAP convenor Kejriwal marched on foot in New Delhi assembly constituency, while Kiran Bedi campaigned in his seat Krishna Nagar
 congress kii prachaar samiti ke pramukh ajay maakan or party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rajdhani main road sho kiya
 Kejriwal is contesting from New Delhi, Kiran Bedi Krishna Nagar and Maken Sadar Bazar seat
 haal ke zyaadaatar opinian pole aam aadmi party ko badhat dikhaa rahe hai
 According to Opinion Polls by India Today Group and Cicero, the path of AAP seems easy for the majority
 pole ke mutabik vah 38 se 46 siten jeet sakati he, vahiin bijepi 19 se 25 siton par simat sakati he
 The last time the hung Legislative Assembly was elected was a hung assembly in the 2013 elections, in which BJP got the highest number of 31 seats and AAP was second with 28 seats
 congress 43 siton se ghatakar 8 siton tak simat gai thi
 The AAP formed the government with external support from the Congress after taking public opinion among the hung assembly, but the Congress and BJP did not support the Jan Lokpal Bill in the assembly
 iske baad mukhyamantri kejariwal ne 14 farvari 2014 ko istipha de diya tha
 After Kejriwal's resignation, President's rule was imposed here from 17 February
 AAP kii baar-baar maang or supreme court kii fatkaar ke baad dilli main phir se chunaav karaane kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 (input: IANS) pradhanmantri ke rup main duusare kaarykaal kii shuruyaat karne ja rahe narendra modi ne shanivaar ko kaha ki unki sarkaar ab nai urja ke saath, nae bharat ke nirmaan ke liye nai yatra shuru karegi
 Modi also asked the newly elected NDA mps to work without discrimination
 bijepi nit rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan kaa netaa chune jane ke baad apane kareeb 75 minute ke bhaashan main modi ne alpsankhyakon kaa bhi vishwaas jeetne kii jarurat bataate hue kaha ki vot-bank kii raajnneeti main bharosa rakhane waalon ne alpsankhyakon ko dar main jeene par majaboor kiya, hamen is chal ko samaapt kar sabko saath lekar chalanaa hoga
 Learn 10 big things about PM Modi's speech
 
 
 1
 PM Modi taught the newly elected mps of BJP on all the issues
 nae chunakar aae saasandon se unhone kaha ki hamaara moh hamen sankat main daalata he
 So our new and old colleagues avoid these things because now the country will not forgive
 hamaari bahut badi jimmedaariyaan hai
 We have to fulfill them
 vaani se, bartaav se, aachaar se, vichaar se hamen apane aapako badalanaa hoga
 The country hates VIP culture
 ham bhi naagarik hai to qatari main kyon khadey nahin rah sakate
 i want that we should change ourselves keeping the public in mind
 laal batti hataane se koi aarthik phayda nahin hue, janata ke bich acha massej gaya he
 He said that mps should also stand in queues like other citizens when needed
 2
 On the whisper of being made a minister, Modi said, "there have been many such Narendra Modi born in this country who has made a cabinet
" jo bhi jitkar aae hai, sab mere hai
 The government is not going to make anyone else, they are the ones who are responsible
 akhbaar ke pannon se na mantri banate hai, na mantripad jate hai
 He said that ministers should not rely on the names running in media reports for the posts, responsibility will be given according to the rules
 3
 While advising to stay away from the media, PM Modi said that it should be avoided
 isse agar bachakar chalate hai to bahut kuch bachaa sakate hai
 Our attachment puts us in trouble
 isliye hamaare nae or purana saathi in chizon se bachein kyonki ab desh maaf nahin karegaa
 We have huge responsibilities
 hamen inhen nibhaana he
 We must change ourselves by speech, by behavior, by behavior, by thought
 4
 Modi said, 'people have given us such a big order
 swaabhaavik he ki seenaa chaudaa ho jaataa he, maathaa ooncha ho jaataa he
 This is the responsibility of the public representative, there can be no distinction for that
 jo hamaare saath the, ham unke liye bhi hai or jo bhavishya main hamaare saath chalane vaale hai, ham unke liye bhi hai
 Our slogan (NARA) is national aspiration and regional ambition
 5
 PM said, NDA has two essentials, first energy and second synergy
 ye energy or sinerjee ek aisa chemical he, jisko lekar ham shashakt or samarthyavan hue hai, jisko lekar hamen aage chalanaa he
 He said that elections in India were a celebration in themselves
 matdaan bhi anek rangon se bharaa hua tha, lekin vijayotsav usase bhi shandaar tha
 6
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki prachand janadesh jimmedaariyon ko bhi bahut badha detaa he
 We are willing to accept the responsibilities gladly
 uske liye nai urja, nai umang ke saath hamen aage badhanaa he
 The democracy of India, the voter of India, the citizen of India, his lowly conscience, probably cannot be measured by any criteria
 7
 Modi said that the tremendous mandate also greatly increases the responsibilities
 jimmedaariyon ko ham saharsha sweekaar karne ke liye nikle hue log hai
 For that we have to move forward with new energy, new enthusiasm
 bharat kaa loktantr, bharat kaa matadaata, bharat kaa naagarik uskaa jo nir-ksheer vivek he, shaayad kisi maapdand se use mapa nahin ja saktaa he
 He said that the status of power never affects the voter of India
 satta-bhav na bharat kaa matadaata sweekaar karata he, na pachaa paata he
 The specialty of this country is that even in front of the greatest power of power, it accepts the service by bowing its head
 ham chaahe bhaajapa yaa endie ke pratinidhi banakar aae hon, janata ne hamen sweekaar kiya he sevabhaav ke kaaran
 8
 unhone kaha ki 2019 kaa chunaav saamaajik ekta kaa andolan ban gaya, samta bhi, mamata bhi, sambhaav bhi, mambhaav bhi
 This atmosphere gave this election a new height
 ye desh parishram kii puja karata he, ye desh imaan ko sir par baithaata he
 Look at the strength of the weak conscience in the voter of India
 parishram kii agar paraakaashtha he or eemaandaaree par ratti bhar bhi sanshay na ho to desh uske saath chalegaa
 9
 piem modi ne kaha ki janpratinidhi kabhi bhed nahin saktaa he
 Addressing the new public representatives, he said that we cannot have any alienation with the people's representatives
 isaki takat bahut badi hoti he
 Will try to win hearts
 mere jivan ke kai padaav rahe, isliye main in chizon ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhataa hum, maine itane chunaav dekhe, haar-jeet sab dekhe, lekin main kah saktaa hum ki mere jivan main 2019 kaa chunaav ek prakaar kii tirthayatra thi
 10
 desh main garib ek raajnneetik samvaad-vivaad kaa vishay rahaa, ek fishan kaa hissaa ban gaya, bhramjaal main rahaa
 In a five-year term, we can say that we have pierced the deceit that was going on with the poor and have reached directly to the poor
 desh par is garibi kaa jo tag laga he, usase desh ko mukt karnaa he
 We have to live for the rights of the poor, we have to spend our lives
 garibon ke saath jaisaa chal hua, vaisaa hi chal desh kii minurity ke saath hua he
 Unfortunately, the country's minority has been kept so confused and fearful in that deception
 usase acha hota ki minurity kii shiksha, swasthya kii chintaa kii jaati
 i have come to expect from you in 2019 that we have to pierce this trick too
 hamen vishwaas jeetna he
