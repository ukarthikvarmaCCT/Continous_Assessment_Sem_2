 Lord Shiva said that take your sleep
 inkaa naam asavari devi he
 Goddess Parvati was very happy to see her sister-in-law
 asavari devi snaan karke ain or bhojan maangane lageen
 Goddess Parvati served food
 jab asavari devi ne khaanaa shuru kiya to parvati ke bhandar main jo kuch bhi tha sab kha gayi auramahadev ke liekuch bhi nahin bachaa
 This made Parvati sad
 iske baad jab devi parvati ne nanad ko pahanane ke liye nae vastra die to moti asavari devi ke liye vah vastra chote pad gaye
 Parvati started arranging for her other clothes
 is bich nanad rani ko achaanak majaak soojha or unhone apane pairon kii daraaron main parvati ji ko chupa liya
 Parvati ji suffocated
 mahadev ne jab asavari devi se parvati ke bare main poocha to asavari devi ne jhooth bolaa
 When Shiva said that this is not your bullying, Asavari Devi started laughing and slammed on the ground
 isse pair kii daraaron main dabi devi parvati baahar aa giriin
 On the other hand, Naveen's behavior, Seedvi Parvati's anger reached the seventh sky
 devi parvati ne bhagwaan shiv se kaha ki kripaya nanad ko jaldi se sasuraal bhejne kii krupa karen
 i made a big mistake that i wanted a sister-in-law
 is par bhagwaan shiv ne asavari devi ko kailash se vidaa kar diya

 The committee constituted by the Supreme Court is going to announce its decision on Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra in Delhi on Tuesday
 iskaa sidhaa asar en-shrinivasana par bhi padegaa
 The decision of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals has been decided by RM Lodha, a judge in the Supreme Court
 bas iskaa adhikarik elaan hona baaqi he
 This decision is important for many reasons in the campaign to clear cricket
 bisisiai ko ise maananaa hoga
 They cannot plead to reconsider it

 The Dharma Jagran Samiti has given rise to further issues of conversion
 samiti ke rajeshwar singh ne khuleam kaha ki 2021 tak sabko hindu bana diya jayega
 Rajeshwar Singh, leader of the Dharm Jagran Manch, who was active in UP for conversion, declared, 'by December 21, 2021, all Muslims and Christians in the country will be converted to Hinduism
 yahi nahin, rajeshwar singh ne yah bhi kaha ki musalamaanon or isaayiyon ko desh main rahane kaa haq bhi nahin he or 2021 tak inhen desh se nikaal diya jayega
 Let me tell you, in August this year, 72 people left Christianity in Aligarh and became Hindu again
 is kadi main 8 disambar ko agra main 200 musalamaanon kii phir se hindu dharm main vaapasi karai gai
 The entire program was organized in association with the Dharm Jagran Coordination Department and Bajrang Dal, a subsidiary organization of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 iske tahat kareeb 57 muslim pariwaron ko waapas hindu dharm main shaamil kiya gaya or kaarykram ko naam diya gaya 'purakhon kii ghar vaapasi'
 After this, on 25 December, this organization had announced to convert about 15,000 muslim-christians in Aligarh, but the UP police did not approve it, citing the deterioration of communal harmony
 'ghar vaapasi' ke naam se hone vaale is samaaroh main bijepi saansad yogi adityanath bhi shaamil hone vaale the

 puraa desh mere saath hai
 Rajput is getting up again
 ab koi is kaam ko roak nahin saktaa, jisko aap punah dharmantaran kah rahe hai ,wo mathaantaran jo musalaamanon ne rajputon kaa kiya tha wo ho rahaa he
 Who dares, this is all a political conspiracy, this is the fear of Muslims
 main musalamaanon ke bhay se aapako mukt kar duungaa
 No Muslim can fight me
 main saare hindustan ko hindu banaaungaa
 i will make Pakistan, Afghanistan a Hindu
 gandhi ji kaa betaa hariraam musalmaan ho gaya to gandhi ji ke kehane par madan mohan malviya ne uskaa shuddhikaran karaayaa
 When Mahatma Gandhi can purify his son, then why can't i have people of my religion
 maine apane jivan ko samaaj ke liye samarpit kar diya
 My society should make me a Christian, a Muslim, i do not accept
 aapkaa kya adhikaar he rokane kaa, media waalon ko samaj nahin aata he ki jahaan hindu kam hota he wo hissaa desh se nikal jaataa he
 There is terror of Christians, Muslims
 aap desh ke kai pradeshon main jaakar baat nahin kar sakate

 aam aadmi party ke netaaon ne NBCC kii website par maujuud jaankaree ke zariye centre sarkaar par badi gadabadi kaa aarope lagaaya he
 AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj has made 6 big allegations, questioning the NBCC project
 1
 First charge - a large part of this scheme is being made for commercial use
 project ke bare main website par saafe-taur par likhaa hua he ki yahaan par commercial offis banenge, dukaane banengi, gharon ko privet str par logon ko bechaa jayega, world trade centre banaaya jayega
 Even the central government is promoting it in an absolutely commercial manner, such as being very close to the metro, a few minutes away from the airport, is full of all amenities
 2
 Second charge - Union Environment Minister Dr
 harshavardhan media ke saath-saath puri dilli ke saamne jhooth bol rahe hai
 According to the evidence obtained from the website of the Union Ministry of Environment, Dr
 harshavardhan ke offis ne hi 12 june 2018 ko is project ke liye invyrement impect assesament report ko manzuri di he, or is report main saaf taur par yah likhaa hua he ki is project main keval sarojini nagar main lagbhag 11 hazaar ped kaate jaaenge
 3
 teesraa aarope -sarkaar dwaara hameshaa hi kisi bhi project ko banane se pehle or uske banane ke baad paidaa hone vaali samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke bare main sochaa jaataa he or uskaa sampoorn byora bhi diya jaataa he, lekin yahaan jahaan pehle se hi yatayaat is ilaake ke logon ke liye ek badi samasya bana hua he, vahaan 80 hazaar gadiyon kii parking ban jane ke baad kya halaat honge or usase kaise nipta jayega iske bare main koi vivaran nahin diya gaya he
 4
 chauthaa aarope -jis jagah par yah project ban rahaa he vahaan kaa tatkaal pradooshan str PM 2
 5 and PM 10 remain at very high levels
 chintajanak baat yah he ki agar yahaan se 17000 ped kaate gaye to pradooshan kaa str bhayaavah ho saktaa he
 But the Central Government, not worrying about the public life of the people of Delhi, saw only its political advantage and approved the approval of this project
 5
 Fifth charge - In any such government project, there is a provision for public hearing so that the people of that area, ngo's and RWA, can make the government aware of the problems arising from the project
 aap sabhi ko jaankaar aashcharya hoga ki kendriya paryaavaran mantralay kii website se praapt kaagajon ke anusaar is project kii jan-sunwaayee aaj se lagbhag 118 saal pehle 1 janvari 1900 ko hi yojit kii ja chuki he

 Google Chrome ke apadet main mili gambhir khami
 After the update, the user's app data is deleted
 Google kaa krom broujar duniya bhar main kaaphi popular he
 Recently the company released the Chrome 79 version for Android smartphones and users
 lekin ab company ne is apadet ko roak diya he
 The reason is that a serious bug was found in it, which was deleting the user's data
 Chrome 79 kaa ye bag yugers ke smartphone kaa yujar data delit kar rahaa tha or saath hi mobile eps ko bhi riset kar rahaa tha
 Google developers have admitted that it was a mistake, due to which it has happened
 ab ye bhi ek bada sawaal he ki google krom broujar kisi smartphone ke duusare eps kaa data kaise riset kar saktaa he? aap kisi ap main web pej ke saath log in kar sakate hai, jinke paas khud rendoring capacity nahin hoti he
 In this case, they are loaded via Chrome and it is called webview
 mana jaataa he ki kuch eps puri tarah se inside web vyuu chalaate hai
 For example, you can take Lite apps under which the Twitter Lite app has been developed
 aap ise is tarah samaj sakate hai
 The data lock storage and web of mobile apps are stored under SQL
 ye data yujar kaa hota he or aaj kal zyaadaatar eps local storage or websql kaa hi istemaal karte hai
 That is, even inside the mobile app, you see web view components, which are a version of Chrome itself
 jaise hi chrome 79 kaa apadet aayaa in eps main store kiye gaye data or files riset hone lage
 Because there was a flaw in this update
 Chrome 79 main apadet hone ke saath web vyuu aplication kaa data riset or delit hone lage
 In this situation the company has to hold these updates
 Google ke developers philhal ek apadet par kaam kar rahe hai jo is samasya ko hal kar sake
 But those who have updated it may face the problem of data deletion
 philhal ye bhi saaf nahin he ki isse kitne yugers asal main prabhavit hai

 Bablu was not one of the group who does not stop the car even after seeing the injured on the road, making those videos, likes paane ke pher main bhi nahin padataa tha, wo cricket or footbal kheltaa tha, usne apni koching main naujavaanon ko bataaya tha ki aakhir dam tak koshish karo, haar mat maano or ye kaam wo asal zindagi main bhi karata tha
 The comments vaise to maihar, sharada devi ke mandir kii vajah se janaa jaataa he lekin satna zile ke khilaadi maihar ko bablu martin ke naam se bhi jaanate the
 He was a fan of Azhar - standing collar as soon as he came on the field, swung his wrist and shot, bowled and did not miss a dive while fielding while fielding
 usne footbal or cricket khilne kaa sapana dekhne vaale kai bacchon ko koching di thi or is peedi ko jate-jate shaayad ek or sabak de gaya ki video banane se zyaada zaruri he bablu martin bananaa yani ek mukammal insaan bananaa

 Although Maihar is known because of the temple of Sharada Devi, but players of Satna district also knew Maihar by the name of Bablu Martin
 wo azhar kaa fain tha-maidan main aate hi collar khadey karata, kalai ghumaakar shot martha, gendbaazi bhi kar letaa or fielding karte vaqt chot kaa khyaal na karte hue dive maarane se nahin chukta
 He had coached many children who dreamed of playing football and cricket, and by passing this generation, perhaps another lesson has been given that it is more important than making videos to become Bablu Martin ie a complete person

 ’ Underworld don Abu Salem is also convicted in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts
 iske alaava us par tii series ke gulshan kumaar or abhinetri manisha koirala ke secretary kii hatya samet pachaason maamle hai
 He was extradited from Portugal to India in November 2005
 qaayade se use bhi faansee honi chahie thi
 But he is 'eating biryani in jail'
 akhir kyon use faansee nahin hui or yaaqub memon ko faansee ho rahi he? The answer is simple
 abu salem or faansee ke fande ke bich portugal kaa kanoon he jiske tahat salem ko is shart ke saath bharat ko saunpa gaya ki use maut kii sazaa nahin di jaaegi
 He was caught in 2002 in Lisbon
 lekin use paane main bharat ko qareeb teen saal lag gaye kyonki salem apane pratyrpan ke kilaaf court main ladaai lard rahaa tha
 After being brought to India in 2006, he and his partner Riyaz Siddiqui were convicted in TADA court for carrying and distributing weapons in the Mumbai bomb blasts case
 tab se wo aaajeevan karawas kii sazaa bhugat rahaa he
 In July 2012, when some new cases were filed against him that could lead him to death, the court of Portugal again came into action
 vahaan kii ek nichali adaalat ne salem ko bharat bheje jane kii sharton ke ulanghan kii vajah se uskaa pratyrpan kaarij kar diya
 The Supreme Court there also questioned the right of India to appeal against it
 kul mila kar abu salem ko faansee dene par bharat sarkaar ke haath bandhe hai, lekin yaaqub memon ke maamle main aisa nahin he
 The comments yaaqub memon ko nepal se bharat laayaa gaya
 Yakub's desire was to come to India and prove himself innocent
 iske liye bhartiya athurity se sampark main aayaa
 He was not followed by the government of any country like Portugal which would give him a legal umbrella through which he would not be hanged in any way like Abu Salem has not been
 yaaqub ko faansee par supreme court kii muhar bhi lag chuki he
 In such a situation, no one is questioning the decision of the judiciary, but many people are questioning the adherence to the legal procedures in the decision of the TADA court
 kai ye bhi kah rahe hai ki yaaqub ko jin sharton ke saath laayaa gaya us par dhokhaa hua he or use bali kaa bakra banaaya ja rahaa he
 The real culprit is Tiger Memon, he should be hanged
 yaaqub beqasoor nahin he, lekin use faansee kii sazaa munasib nahin he
 The cases are again before the Supreme Court
 yaaqub ke parivaaravaalon samet uske shubhachintakon kii ummid bhi isi par tiki hai
 May there be some relief
 jawaab sidhaa sa he
 Between Abu Salem and the gallows is a Portugal law under which Salem is handed over to India with the condition that he will not be sentenced to death
 wo 2002 main hi lisbon main pakadaa gaya tha
 But it took India nearly three years to get it because Salem was fighting in court against his extradition
 bharat laae jane ke baad 2006 main tada court main use or uske saathi riyaaz siddiqi ko mumbai bam dhamaakon maamle main hathiyaar dhone or baantne kaa doshi paaya gaya
 He has since been serving life imprisonment
 july 2012 main jab uske kilaaf kuch nae cese darj kiye gaye jo use faansee tak le ja sakate the to portugal kii adaalat phir harqat main aayi
 a lower court there dismissed his extradition because of a violation of the terms of sending Salem to India
 vahaan ke supreme court ne iske khilaaf bharat ko apil karne ke adhikaar par bhi sawaal uthaa diya
 Overall, the hands of the Government of India are tied to the hanging of Abu Salem, but this is not the case with Yaqub Memon
 tippaniyan Yakub Memon was brought to India from Nepal
 yaaqub kii ichha bharat aakar khud ko nirdosh sabit karne kii thi
 i got in touch with the Indian authority for this
 uske peeche portugal jaise kisi desh kii sarkaar nahin thi jo use aisi kanoonee chhatari detii jiske zarie use kisi bhi haal main faansee kii sazaa nahin hoti jaise abu salem ko nahin hui he
 Yakub has also been given the seal of the Supreme Court on hanging
 aise main nyaaypalika ke faisle par beshak koi sawaal nahin uthaa rahaa ho lekin tada court ke faisle main kanoonee prakriyaaon ke paalan par kai log sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Many are also saying that the conditions with which Yakub was brought have been deceived and he is being made a scapegoat
 asal doshi tiger memon he faansee use honi chahie
 Yakub is not innocent, but the punishment for his execution is not appropriate
 maamla ek baar phir supreme court ke saamne hai
 The hopes of his well-wishers, including the family of Yaqub, are also based on this
 shaayad koi raahat mil jaae
 In July 2012, when some new cases were filed against him that could lead him to death, the court of Portugal again came into action

 Farooq feels that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir belongs to PAK
 lekin desh unako saaf kar dena chahta he ki ki kashmir puraa hamaara tha- hamaara he or hamaara rahegaa
 Actor Rishi Kapoor has done the right thing, who finds Farooq's statement right in search of his roots in Pakistan

 He further said that Farooq Abdullah is speaking the language of Pakistan
 aaj kii taarikh main ghati kii is badahaali ke liye abdulla parivaar khaastaur par jimmedaar he
 He should apologize to the people of Jammu and Kashmir as well as the country for his statement
 aise log kabhi nahin chaahate hai ki ghati main shanti sthapit ho
 Because whenever there is an attempt to restore peace in Kashmir and to bring the wandering youth into the mainstream, then politicians like Farooq start speaking the language of Pakistan

 The Modi government has lashed out at the opposition party Congress over the triple talaq bill in Rajya Sabha
 kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki congress party select cameti ke bahaane teen talaak ko paarit nahin hone dena chaahati he
 Congress party is doing vote bank politics
 is dauraan unhone congress party, sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi kii kadi aalochana kii
 The Union Minister said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi is not even aware of the triple talaq
 ham teen talaak ke mudde par congress ko desh ke saamne benakaab karenge
 Also, this triple talaq bill will be brought again in the next session of Parliament
 bataa den ki rajyasabha main aam sahmati nahin ban paane ke kaaran monsoon satr ke aakhri din shuukravaar kotin talaak biltaal diya gaya
 Talking to the media, Ravi Shankar Prasad said, 'I have to tell very painfully that the Congress party has done its best to stop the triple talaq bill
 hamane is bill main teen sudhaar kiye or isko phir se sadan main lekar aae hai
 We repeatedly asked the Congress, what is your objection, tell it
 
 
 
 We will solve it
 par congress party is bill ko select cameti main bhejne kii rat laga rakhi he
 He said that in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress party used to come up in the well and raise another subject and did not let the House run
 isse pehle kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne rajyasabha main kaha ki sadan main sabhi bill paarit ho rahe hai, lekin teen talaak bill kyon nahin paarit ho rahaa he? choti-moti baton ko lekar ek jatke main muslim mahilaon ko talaak diya ja rahaa he or wo nyaay ko bhatak rahi hai
 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad questioned Chairman Venkaiah Naidu, 'should not these oppressed Muslim women get justice? These afflicted Muslim women come to me daily
 ' unhone kaha ki congress party select cameti ke bahaane bill ko latakaana chaahati he
 Apart from this, Anant Kumar alleged that Sonia and Rahul Gandhigadiyali are shedding tears in the name of providing justice to Muslim women
 vastav main wo nahin chaahate hai ki muslim mahilaon ko nyaay mili
 Anant Kumar said, 'we wanted the triple talaq bill to be passed in the Rajya Sabha in this session
 is vajah se ham rajyasabha main subah se intjaar karte rahe
 But the Congress kept it hanging

 The Congress alleged that both the mlas showed their ballots to Amit Shah during voting, which is against the rule
 haalanki, bijepi ise nakaarti rahi
 The battle of Gujarat reached Delhi, after this the battle of Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections reached Delhi
 congress netaa randeep singh surajevaala or arpyen singh ne chunaav ayog jaakar maamle kii shikaayat kii
 At the same time, while presenting his arguments, he appealed to cancel the votes of the two mlas
 congress kii is prayaas ko kamjor karne ke liye bijepi ne 6 kendriya mantriyon kaa dailygation chunaav ayog bheja
 Under the leadership of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Piyush Goyal, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Nirmala Sitharaman and Dharmendra Pradhan reached the Election Commission office and sought to circumvent the Congress appeal
 3-3 baar EC daftar pahunche netabijepi kaa dailygation chunaav ayog ke daftar se niklaa hi thi ki kuch der baad vahaan congress ke varisht netaaon kaa jamaavada lag gaya
 Senior leader p

 Congress gave the example of cancellation of vote here in Haryana
 congress ke baad phir bijepi or bijepi ke baad phir congress, is tarah se donon partiyon ke netaa teen-teen baar ayog main apana paksh lekar pahunche
 The Election Commission's decision came in the middle of the night, after this, the Election Commission went for hours
 aakhirkaar raat kareeb 12 baje ayog ne congress ke donon baagi vidhayakon ke vot radd karne kaa aadesh diya
 Along with this order, the commission also directed the counting of votes
 haalanki, bijepi ne ayog ke is faisle ko galat tehraaya
 Gujarat Deputy CM Nitin Patel expressed displeasure over the commission's decision as incorrect
 is dauraan bijepi adhyaksh amit shah gandhinagar main counting centre ke baahar maujuud rahe
 He was accompanied by several senior leaders along with Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani

 The BJP argued for a hearing on its complaint against the Congress mlas, seeking intervention from the Election Commission
 gujarat bijepi netaaon ne ek viral video kaa bhi hawala diya
 Meanwhile, Gujarat Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said that we are fighting the fight for justice
 unhone kaha ki bijepi counting shuru nahin hone de rahi he
 The BJP says that the Election Commission has not acted on the application we gave against the Congress mlas, so the BJP did not allow counting
 raat kareeb 1
 The counting of voting started at 30 pm, after waiting for several hours, finally around 1 in the night
 30 baje voton kii ginati shuru hui
 Coming out of the polling station, Congress MLA Shailesh Parmar claimed his victory with 44 votes to Ahmed Patel
 EC se milane ke baad bijepi kaa bayanbijepi dailygation ne chunaav ayog se mulaakaat ke baad bijepi netaa ravishankar prasad ne bataaya ki congress party subah se bebuniyaad aarope laga rahi he
 The Congress is stunned by the news of the defeat, so they have raised objections
 chunaav ayog se apil kii he ki is aarope par koi mauka nahin diya janaa chahie
 Ravi Shankar Prasad warned the Congress to go to court and challenge the case
 EC se mulaakaat ke baad congress kaa bayaandusri baar chunaav ayog se shikaayat karne ke baad congress netaa pi
 Chidambaram said the same happened in Haryana, where the vote was canceled
 unhone kaha ki hamaare paas saboot ke taur par video he
 The vote should be canceled if BJP shows the ballot paper
 is dauraan randeep surajevaala ne bijepi par takat kaa durupyog karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 On the vote of the JDU-NCP MLA, Suspense JDU MLA Chhotu Vasava has claimed that he has voted for Ahmed Patel
 vahiin jediu ke varisht netaa kasee tyaagi kaa daawa ekadam ulataa he
 He has said that the JDU MLA voted for the BJP candidate
 vahiin congress ne ensipi ke ek vidhayak kaa vot milane kaa daawa kiya tha
 Although Congress leader Ashok Gehlot had claimed 45 votes to Ahmed Patel, he has got only 44 votes
 aise main ye dekhnaa bhi dilachasp hoga ki ahamed patel kaa ek vot kaise kar rah gaya
 Let me tell you that voting was held on Tuesday for three Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat
 teen siton par chaar ummidavaar lard rahe the
 The victory of BJP president Amit Shah and Union Minister Smriti Irani on two seats was believed to be assured
 jabaki ahamed patel ke khilaaf bijepi ummidavaar balavant rajput kii jeet ko lekar bada sanshay tha
 On Patel's victory, BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya said that his party is not supporting the Congress
 57 vot hone ke baad bhi congress ko itane kam vot kaise mili, yah sabase bada sawaal he
 The secret of tremendous success that Congress has got in the last two decades in the Lok Sabha elections is that this time one vote went out of every three
 bhaajapa ke aundhe munh girane kaa bhi kaaran yahi bana
 The Congress has won 206 out of 543 seats and its vote share is around 28 out of the total votes polled
 5 pratishat he
 26 to the party in the last election

 When the CPI (M) leaders started the mathapachhi at the party's 20th Congress (mahasammelan) in Kozhikode on 4 April, the whole atmosphere became serious with introspection and a sense of acceptance of some of their mistakes

 In Maharashtra as well as Haryana, the BJP could neither repeat the 2014 performance in the assembly elections, nor could it sustain the wave of Lok Sabha elections held five months ago
 in loksabhaa chunaavon main vah 90 main se 79 vidhansabha kshetron main aage rahi thi
 Even in strongholds like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, BJP and NDA lost by-elections

 In fact, the by-election results were mixed and the Congress, local parties and even independent candidates were successful in defeating the BJP or giving a tough fight, while the situation was very different during the Lok Sabha elections
 bhaajapa ke liye chintaa kii baat yah he ki chunaav nattejey aise samay main aae hai jab vaicharik or bhaavnaatmak mudde ko bhaajapa apane charam par laa chuki he
 With the formation of the NDA government again, Article 370 was made effective in Jammu and Kashmir

 During these elections, the issue of Article 370 and Ram temple as well as teaching Pakistan a lesson was also thrown up by the BJP leaders
 lekin in chunaavon main ye mudde nahin chale
 Says a leader associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, "BJP used the weapons (issues) of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak (lok Sabha) in the assembly elections to stifle their edge
 kam se kam yah baat to charchaa main aa hi gai ki in bhaavnaatmak muddon kii dhar ab pehle jaisi nahin rahi

 Hemant Soren, leader of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), says, "the way the BJP lost badly in Chhattisgarh, the same will happen in Jharkhand

 congress ke media vibhaag ke pramukh randeep singh surajevaala kehete hai, ''congress gathbandhan ke tahat jharkhand main chunaav ladegi
 bjp's defeat in the state is certain, this has been proved by the recent assembly election results
 ''uttar pradesh ke sanketauttar pradesh main upachunaav hameshaa se bhaajapa ke liye chunauteepurn rahe hai
 The ruling BJP, which won 62 of up's 80 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, was desperate to erase the poor performance of previous by-elections in the assembly by-elections
 isaki kaman mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke haath main thi, to pradesh ke nae bhaajapa adhyaksh swatantradev singh kii santhnik kshamta bhi kasuti par thi
 Among the 11 assembly seats in UP, Rampur Samajwadi Party (SP), Jalalpur Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), apart from Gangoh, Iglaas (reserved), Lucknow Cantt, Govindnagar, Manikpur, Belha (reserved), Ghosi and Zaidpur ( Safe) The seat was occupied by BJP, while Pratapgarh seat was with Apna Dal, an ally of BJP
 in 11 vidhansabha siton main bhaajapa pichhali baar kii tulana main jaidpur surakshit seat ganvaa kar saat seat hi jeet saki
 Apna Dal won the Pratapgarh seat, but the most impressive performance was of the SP
 sapa ne rampur, jalalpur or jaidpur (surakshit) seat vidhansabha seat jitkar apni do siton kaa ijapha kiya
 Ajit Kumar, a political analyst and a retired professor at Banaras Hindu University, says, "despite pouring full power and full opposition, the BJP was able to win fewer assembly seats than last time
" yah teen baaten jaahir karata he
 First, the public is not very happy with the functioning of the state government
 doosraa, berogari or bigadi kanoon vyavastha ke aage ayodhya, kashmir kaa mudda bahut kargar nahin sabit hua he
 And third, the BJP cannot lead in UP without Narendra Modi's campaign
 ''upi main logon kii naaraazgi kaa alam yah tha ki iglass vidhansabha seat par 21 aktubar ko voting ke dauraan aawaara pashuon ke aatank se peedit kai gaanv waalon ne matdaan kaa bahishkaar kar bhaajapa sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya tha
 Farmer leader Harnam Singh says, "if in time the state government does not get rid of the terror of stray animals, then the BJP may suffer a lot in the 2022 assembly elections
 ''haalanki, sahyogi apana dal ke saath vidhansabha upachunaav kii kul 11 main se 8 siten jeetne ko bhaajapa apni uplabdhi ke taur par pesh kar rahi he
 State BJP spokesperson Manoj Mishra says, "the BJP has won more than 70 per cent of the assembly by-elections in UP, while the opposition parties have not been able to get around it
" '' pehali baar chunaav lard rahi basapa ke liye ye upachunaav nattejey behad niraashajanak rahe
 bsp's Jalalpur assembly seat went to the sp's account and it did not open its account in these by-elections
 aise main sapa ne teen siten jitkar yah sanket de diya he ki upi main bhaajapa ke saamne vahi mukhya vipakshi dal he
 sp's national president Akhilesh Yadav will challenge Chief Minister Yogi's power in the 2022 assembly elections, at least the same is indicated by the results of the by-election
 rajasthan kii raah nahin asanaloksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ne rajasthan kii sabhi 25 siten jeet lee thi
 But in the assembly by-elections, the BJP could not sustain this trend
 congress ne bhaajapa se mandava seat badi aasaani se chin liya or bhaajapa kii sahyogi rashtriya loktantric party (aralapi) apni khimsar seat, bahut chote antar se hi barkaraar rakh pai
 These results have come as a big relief to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, especially after he was eliminated in the general elections held in May, a success that shows that people have faith in him
 khimsar, jise aralapi kaa sabase majboot garh mana jaataa he vahaan majboot gheraabandi karte hue gahalot uske jeet ke antar ko mahaj 5,000 se kam voton par lekar aae
 RLP President Hanuman Beniwal was successful in winning his brother Narayan but the seat which Hanuman had won comfortably last year, but this time could not be done
 rajasthan main, sattadhari dal aksar upachunaav haarate rahe hai
 Gehlot can claim from these by-election results that the defeat of the general election was not a vote against his government but was a result of the Modi wave

 This brings the number of its members to 115 in the 230-seat assembly
 purv kendriya mantri kantilal bhuriya ne bhaajapa ke bhaanu bhuriya ko 27 hajaar se zyada voton se haraaya
 This victory will give a little more strength to the Congress government of the state, which already has the support of four Independents, one SP and two BSP mlas
 pichley kuch samay se congress ko pashchimi madhya pradesh ke is janajaatiy ilaake, jhabua main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he

 in the 2018 assembly elections
 es
 Had to be beaten by Damor
 phir is saal may main damor ne loksabhaa chunaavon main kantilal ko bhi haraa diya tha
 So the assembly seat was vacated
 upachunaav ke nattejey ke baad mukhyamantri kamalnath ne kaha, ''jhabua kaa nateeja bataata he ki log bhaajapa se niraash hai, keval rajya hi main nahin balki centre main bhi
 "if the BJP had saved Jhabua's seat, it would have got some psychological benefit as well
 lekin, aakhikar congress kii ranneeti kaam ai or vah baagi hue purv congress vidhayak jevier meda ko kaabo main karne main kaamyaab rahi

 Police Captain Nitin Tiwari started the campaign and called for traffic awareness
 aam dinon kii apeksha ravivaar ko sadakon par helmet pahanane waalon kii sankhya badi najar ai
 On this occasion, the SSP said that the campaign for helmets had been in operation for the past several days, but now it will definitely have a wide impact due to mandatory helmets on the vehicles which are sourced for running, petrol pumps
 is abhiyaan kii shuruyaat se purv jile ke sabhi petrol pump ke maalikon se isapar charchaa kii gayi or helmet ke phaayde ko dekhte hue sahmati ke saath no helmet no petrol abhiyaan kii shuruyaat hui
 Soon, two-wheelers will not be seen on the streets of Varanasi without a helmet
 janapad ke kai petrol panpon par police kii maujuudagi main abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 The pump workers themselves are refusing to give oil to the bike riders who come without a helmet
 abhiyaan ke chalane se bevajaah ho rahi mauton par jahaan roak lagegi vahiin log dhul, dhuaan ityadi se bhi khud ko bachaa paaenge
 Parents used to appeal to children not to drive without helmets, but often the negligence of the ladles was seen
 aaj ke abhiyaan se abhibhavak bhi khush hai, ki kam se kam isi bahaane unke bachche helmet to pahanenge

 unhone centre sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki centre sibiai kaa galasat istemaal kar vipakshi party ke netaaon ko target kar rahaa he
 Computers, inverters, printers and all other electronic equipment were brought to make Madhya Pradesh panchayats e-panchayats
 centre sarkaar ne iske liye 220 karod rupye kharch kiye
 But without an Internet connection, the plan of e-panchayat is nothing more than a dream just by coming to a computer-printer
 internet kii aas main gram panchayatai-panchayat ke liye jaruri tha ki har gram panchayat main internet pahunche
 There are 22 thousand gram panchayats in Madhya Pradesh, but one percent of them have not yet got internet in the gram panchayats
 adhikari ghar uthaa le gaye upkaranbinointernetke computer, printer, tivi vagairah sab kharid liye gaye or jab kaam hua nahin to kisi gram panchayat main rakhe computer, printer, scinar vagairah kharaab ho gaye to kahin se chori ho gaye
 Somewhere the officers or members of the panchayat took the equipment home
 dhahne kii sthiti main i-bhavandarasal, i-panchayaton ke jariye sab panchayaton ko aapas main jodne kii yojana thi
 a special e-building was also to be built for making e-panchayat
 kai jagah i-bhawan banaae bhi gaye, jo ab dhahne kii sthiti main aa gaye hai
 In many places buildings could not be built, then computers could not be installed
 jin panchayaton main computer-printer vagairah bache bhi hai, unki varantee khatm ho chuki he
 The expenditure of Rs 220 crores is significant considering that the Small Industries Corporation had purchased the computer through a centralized tender and the entire purchase had cost about Rs 220 crores
 yun sarkaar bhi maan rahi he ki kai jagah computer adhikariyon ke gharon main pahunch chuke hai, lekin yah kehane se sarkaar nahin chook rahi ki panchayaton main kaam ho rahaa he
 What is the answer to these two questions? - In the name of e Panchayats, about 220 crore rupees went to the trash? - And if there is wasteful expenditure, who will take responsibility for this? The truth is that e-panchayats have not been made and more than 200 crore rupees Conquered

 ’’ Asked about Dhoni's captaincy, a victim of criticism from former greats like Ian Chappell and Wasim Akram, Srikanth said it would be unfair to just blame his captaincy for poor performance
 unhone kaha, ‘‘dekhie, jab aap haarate hai, to aap kisi bhi cheez ko kaaran bataa sakate hai

 In an election rally held in Aligarh on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that SP President Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav while criticizing the alliance with Congress, the BJP is in a storm in Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne somvaar ko rajya main bhaajapa kii 'aandhi' chalane ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ke daawey par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki samaajwaadiyon ko aandhi ko chirakar cycle chalaane kaa hunar bakhubi aata he
 At an election rallies held in Sitapur and Lakhimpur, Akhilesh said that if the Prime Minister is saying that the bjp's storm is going on in Uttar Pradesh, then he must have seen some wind in Punjab as well, but we socialists know to beat the storm and form the government Huh
 ham jaanate hai ki hawa ke rukh ke khilaaf bhi kis tarah cycle chalaai jaati he
 "comments unhone kaha tha, "yahaan ek prakaar se kesaria sagar mere saamne ufaan par najar aa rahaa he
 When a thunderstorm intensifies, even the younger person cannot survive in that storm, so he seeks some support
 is baar bhaajapa kii aandhi itani tej he ki yahaan ke mukhyamantri kisi ko bhi pakad lete hai
 He is trying to catch more people, but this thunderstorm will not let them stay, nor will they survive
 " akhilesh ne pradhanmantri par uttar pradesh kii kanoon-vyavastha ke bare main galat aankade pesh karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bhagwaan jane ki modi kahaan se aankade le aate hai
 We believe that every word of the Prime Minister will be correct in a democracy, but he should show honesty in putting the figures before the public
 unhone kaha ki agar kanoon-vyavastha dhwast hone ke maamle main agrani teen pradeshon par najar daalen to un sabhi rajyon main bhaajapa kii sarkaar he
 Akhilesh enumerated all the achievements of his government and promised to fulfill every promise made in his election manifesto
 akhilesh ne sitapur or lakhimpur main yojit ek chunavi reliyon main kaha ki pradhanmantri kah rahe hai ki uttar pradesh main bhaajapa kii aandhi chal rahi he, to unhen punjab main bhi kuch hawa najar ai hogi, lekin ham samaajawaadee log aandhi tufaan ko haraakar sarkaar bananaa jaanate hai
 We know how a bicycle is driven against the wind

 jab aandhi tej hoti he to choti umr kaa insaan bhi us aandhi main tik nahin paata, isliye vah koi sahaara dhundta he
 This time the storm of the BJP is so strong that the Chief Minister here catches anyone
 vah or logon ko pakadaney main lage hai, lekin yah aandhi unako naa tikne degi, naa bachane degi
 "akhilesh accused the Prime Minister of presenting wrong figures about the law and order of Uttar Pradesh and said that God knows where Modi comes from

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the Election News Special Newsletter jiesti kii dilli abhi dur he or raah bhi pecho-kham se bharpoor he lekin jiesti ke shilanyas par sabhi rajnatik dalon ko raji karaate hue bijepi ke ranneetikaron ko ehsaas jarur ho gaya he ki jeet kitni bhi bhavy ho, sansadeey loktantr main dosti ke bina baat nahin banati
 The Government's aalim-fazils have also come to know that in order to make friends, the opinions of others have to be given place because ultimately it is the responsibility of the Government to bring forth the results
 yahi mauka he jab bijepi ko jeet ke dambh se nikalakar endie ko nae sire se gande kii koshish shuru kerani chahie jo na keval sarkaar ko chalaane ke liye jaruri he balki chunavi raajnneeti kii agali chunautiyon se nibatane ke liye bhi anivaary he
 The Modi government, which is completing two and a half years in power, is going through many experiences
 inamen sabase bada tajurba yah he ki loksabhaa main bahumat or aam taur par kamjor va bikhare vipaksh ke baavjood centre main prabhavi sarkaar chalaane or kendriya nitiyon ko logon tak pahunchane ke liye ek vyapak rajnatik gathbandhan kii jarurat hoti he, kyonki rajyon main alag-alag dalon ke kshatrap shaan se raaj kar rahe hai
 In these two-and-a-half years of experience, if the recommendations of victory and defeat of assembly elections after 2014 are also mixed, then the need for NDA becomes more vocal
 yah chaahe badi chunavi jeet kaa asar ho yaa phir narendra modi or amit shah ke kaam karne kii style lekin 2014 kii bhavy jeet ke baad endie kahin peeche chhot gaya he
 After the bjp's election campaign started under Modi's leadership, large components of the NDA had collapsed anyway
 jo chote sahyogi bache the vah bhi satta main aane ke baad haashiye par simat gaye
 Although there are about three dozen parties in the list of NDA but apart from BJP, Shiv Sena and Telugu Desam are the two big parties in the NDA, but their membership in Parliament (both houses) is in double (but less than 25)
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii jeet ke baad shivasena lagbhag kinare ho gai
 In 2014, the relationship between BJP and Shiv Sena to form the government in Maharashtra was rewritten, but its writing was neither to BJP nor to Shiv Sena
 isliye gathbandhan main tanaav or bayanon kii patharbaji ab roj kii baat he
 The two parties will probably contest the urban elections in Mumbai separately
 andhra pradesh punargathan yaa vibhaajan vidheyak ke kriyanvayan or andhra ko paryaapt aarthik madad na milane ko lekar telegu desham ke netaa or rajya ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu asahaj ho rahe hai
 Telugu Desam is the second major component of the NDA
 dilli ke rajnatik halkon main is baat kii charchaa he ki beete saptaah naidu ne endie se alag hone ke liye apane sansadeey dal kii apaat baithak tak bula lee thi, jise baad main radd kar diya gaya lekin andhra ke mukhyamantri ne yah elaan to spasht rup se kiya he ki unke saansad dilli main centre sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan karenge
 If the results in the Punjab elections are not favorable to the Akali Dal, then the influence of this constituent in the NDA will also be limited
 inke alaava lok janashakti ek chota ghatak he jabaki ek ek sadasyon vaali kuch partiyaan hai, jinaki rashtriya raajnneeti main bahut ahmiyat nahin he
 It is not that the BJP did not conduct coalition experiments in the last two years, but these efforts were limited to winning the state elections, which had mixed results
 bihar main ek bada gathbandhan banane kii koshish aundhe munh giri
 The allies did more harm than good but local minor parties in Assam proved to be helpful
 in gathbandhanon se rashtriya endie par koi bada asar nahin padaa jo bijepi ke vishaal bahumat kii chaaya main kahin dubak gaya he
 Indian politics turned to non-bjpism with the BJP coming to power with an absolute majority
 iskaa pehla prayog bihar main hua jahaan do dhur virdohi—lalu or nitish ek saath najar aae or jeet kar nikle
 While the second experiment was seen in Bengal where the Left and the Congress befriended and defeated, however, the victory came in the hands of the third force i
e
 Mamata, not the BJP
 ab uttar pradesh main bhi agar koi gathbandhan ubharegaa to vah bijepi ke viruddh hi hoga
 We have to accept that even though the 2014 mandate was clearly in favor of the BJP, that mandate was not very useful in the mathematics of Parliament
 sarkaar ko aage badaae ke liye sahmati or sabko saath lenaa hi padaa tab jaakar jiesti kaa pehla kadam saamne aayaa
 The fact is that the BJP would have started trying to expand the NDA from the time it came to power and would have strengthened the friendship with the big regional parties, then last year, the policies of the central government might have come out with far better results and the central government He would get political benefits
 jiesti kii gahamagahami ke bich dilli ke rajnatik halkon main 2019 yani loksabhaa chunaav kii daal pakane lagi he
 Amit Shah's mission 2019 is in the news, which is focused on preparations to bring BJP back to power
 yah bhi jaanate hai ki loksabhaa ke agle chunaav main jeet kaa formula 2017-18 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se nikalegaa
 It will bring new mandates to all the major states of North West and Central India which can strengthen non-bjpism and open the way for the return of coalition politics in 2019
 sirf yahi nahin ki jiesti kii agali sabhi manjilon par centre sarkaar ko bahudaleey or bahuraji rajiname kii jarurat hogi balki agle dhai saal ke sabhi sudhaaron or skiimon ke kriyanvayan ke liye bhi bijepi ko ab nae kshetreey dost chahie
 And speaking of the next Lok Sabha elections, the formation of a big NDA is going to be mandatory for him because 2019 front will be very tough for BJP without new friends

 swayambhu dharmaguru asaram ke gunahon kii ek-ek parat din ba din ughadati ja rahi he
 The court sent Asaram to Ahmedabad police remand for three days, but according to the revelations from police sources, if a woman who had become a victim of Asaram's sexual harassment became pregnant, then he had to hire a hermit for abortion
 Was left saath hi unki do or sahyogi asaram ke is gande khel main unke saath hoti thim
 The hypocrisy drenched in tears did not work
 jhooth or kukarm par tikaa asaram kaa kaala sach unka peechha nahin chhod rahaa he
 When a girl from Jodhpur gathered the courage to bring Asaram's handiwork in front of him, then many buried dead also began to crumble and with it came the truth of Asaram's three sadhus (dhruvben, Nirmala, Meera)
 asaram ke har gunaah main, har gande khel main saath dene vaali teen mahilaon kaa sach
 According to police sources, these three women are behind every crime of Asaram
 surat kii do bahanon ne asaram or inke bete narayan sai par lagaataar yon shoshan karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 The elder sister alleges that Asaram sexually abused her at the ashram in Ahmedabad
 usee ke aarope main ahmedabad police asaram ko apni remand main lekar poochtacha karnaa chaahati he
 According to the police, the same victim also alleged that if a girl was pregnant, the responsibility of getting an abortion was on Dhruvben
 ahmedabad police ne shanivaar ko adaalat main apni daleel rakhi ki kyon use asaram police remand main chahie
 In its 9 arguments, the police told the court that -1
 asaram medical test or duusare jaanch main saath nahin de rahe
 2
 bharti or lakshmi ko asaram ke aamane-saamne karke poochtacha kerani he
 3
 asaram kii madad karne vaale duusare logon kii jaankaree leni he
 4
 jis vakt peedit ladki asaram ke ashram main thi, us vakt kaa uskaa atendence register bhi hasil karnaa he
 5
 asaram ke yon shoshan se agar mahila garbhvatee ho jaati thi, to garbhpaat ke liye dhruvaben naam kii mahila lekar jaati thi
 Talking about these and taking information about the doctor and hospital
 6
 Asaram is brought on transit remand from Jodhpur, at the end of which he has to be sent back to Jodhpur
 ab jaanch ke liye baar-baar jodhpur janaa mushkil kaam he
 7
 asaram ke sadhak baar-baar poochtacha vaali jagah par aakar hangaamaa machaate hai, jisase jaanch zyada nahin ho pai he
 8
 asaram ke sah aaropee dhel urf nirmala or bangalo urf mira puri jaankaree hone ke baavjood poochtacha main puraa saath nahin de rahi hai
 It was clear before the stand of the Ahmedabad Police that she did not want to leave any stone unturned to extract all the black letters of Asaram
 sari daleel sunne ke baad adaalat ne asaram ko 22 oktober tak ke liye police remand par bhej diya he
 Now the police will expose many more black truths of Asaram and his associates
 asaram ke gunaah par pardaa daalane main uskaa saath ek-do nahin, balki uski teen mahila sadhikaayen de rahi thim
 If Dhruvben was responsible for the abortion of the girls, then the other two sages would not let the voices of the victims rise against Asaram
 ye donon peediton kii aawaaj dabaane ke liye marpet kaa sahaara tak liya karti thim
 Read - What was the meditation of Asaram's cottage According to the sources, Dhruvben, Nirmala and Meera knew about every crime of Asaram
 agar koi ladki asaram ko pasand aa gai to use asaram ke liye taiyaar karne kaa kaam nirmala or maari karti thim
 If a woman became pregnant due to sexual abuse, then Dhruvben had the responsibility of getting her abortion done
 or agar kisi ladki ne asaram ke kukarm ko beparda karne kii baat kar di, to asaram kii ye teenon mahila sadhikaayen uski buree tarah pitayee bhi karti thim
 Asaram's wife and daughter kept playing hide and seek with the law for a long time and they remained hidden until both of them got bail from the court
 jab donon ko zamaanat mili to asaram kii beti bharti media ke saamne ai or asaram or khud par lage aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataaya
 Asaram's daughter Bharti said, 'me and my Maiya ji have been invoked in this case
 koi bhi saadhaaran insaan ye soch kar dekhe ki kya koi beti yaa patni apane pita ke liye aisa kar sakati he
 i have full faith in the court, i have full faith in the judiciary
 'jaane-asaram ke chehre se kaise utre mukhoteasaram or unke bete narayan sai par surat kii do bahanon ne jo balaatkaar ke aarope lagaae hai usamen iljaamon ke chhinte bharti or unki maa par bhi pade hai
 It is alleged that they used to take both girls to Asaram
 ab tak maa or beti donon hi media ke saamne aane se bachati raheen
 But on Thursday, when the court got anticipatory bail, on Friday, Bharti appeared to the world with her answer question
 bharti ke bayaan main asaram par lage aaropon se kinaaraa karne kii kasak bhi dikhi
 In response to the allegations against the mother and herself, a question has been raised by Asaram's daughter Bharti
 kya koi beti yaa patni kisi ke liye aisa kar sakati he?bharti naitikta kii duhai dekar aaropon kii vishwasniyata par sawaal uthaa rahi hai
 But there is also a question that it is difficult to believe Asaram is disgusting
 jise lakhon log bhagwaan kii tarah puujate hai bhala wo apni sadhak se balaatkaar kaise kar saktaa he, lekin kanoon duhai nahin saboot maangata he
 Innocence is to be decided in the court, not in front of the public
