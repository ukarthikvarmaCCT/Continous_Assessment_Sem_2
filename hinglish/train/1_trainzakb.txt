 a student has been hit by five six policemen
 in tasveeron ko dekhakar laga ki police ne chaatro ke saath krurta barti he, jo ki dikh bhi rahaa he
 The students say that the girl students have also been beaten and the students facing physical challenges were also beaten
 chaatraon kaa kahana he ki unhen fail karne se lekar balaatkaar tak kii dhamkee di ja rahi he
 After a while the police released a video on their behalf
 police ke is video main chaatr ek car par pathar barasaa rahe hai
 Are ransacked
 police par pathar maar rahe hai
 Now it is not clear whether the students first stoned or the students vandalized after police sticks
 yah sab jaanch kaa vishay he
 The media is presenting it as the reason why the sticks on the patriots, many people are raising the question of patriotism to make some unknown secularists thunder
 lekin aap apni ankhon se dekhiye or dimag se sochiye ki lathi kiske aadesh se chali, takaraav kyon hua
 There are two types of videos and many types of rumors
 faisla kar lijie
 According to the media, these are patriots, so why is the NIT talking about taking action against them
 police ne exiaar kyon kii he
 The India Today website has written that the rss-backed Jammu Kashmir Study Circle says that it is not that all Kashmiri students are against students from outside
 na hi sabhi kashmiri cricket main bharat ke haarane par khush hote hai
 The NIT incident suggests that separatist elements have made inroads into educational institutions
 inhen baahar karnaa hoga
 Had the influence of separatist elements increased there, such an incident would not have happened before
 khud gaiyr kashmiri chaatr is saal ke pehle tak sthaneey chaatro se takaraav kii koi baat nahin bataa paa rahe hai
 There was a clash about the tricolor
 lekin jinhone pakistan kaa jhanda laharaaya kya unke khilaaf exiaar hui he
 You will ask this question or get angry on two or four journalists
 koi jaanch cameti bithai gai
 Like JNU, rumors have been spread all over the country and people have started believing again
 chaatro kii ladaai college prashasan se he
 They do not want any police action against Kashmiri students
 unhen bharosa nahin he to apane college ke prashasan par
 The comments is tarah ke maahaul ke asar main rajasthan ke chittorgarh kii mewar uniwarsity se 16 kashmiri chaatro ko 25 april tak ke liye nilambit kar diya gaya
 The college had a clash after the India West Indies match
 uske pehle yahaan ke 4 kashmiri ladakon ko bif khaane ke aarope main pakadaa gaya tha, peeta bhi gaya
 The police later said that the Veterinary Board in its report said that the meat eaten was not beef
 abhi forencik jaanch kaa intazaar he
 Whatever facts you keep on NIT Srinagar, you will reach the same which is being spread through whatsapp in various types of messages
 lekin ham phir bhi baat karenge
 Students are saying that our issue is security, do not communalize our issue
 campus ke bheetar inke chehre kyon dhake hue hai, iskaa jawaab enaiti degaa yaa media ke patrkaar jinhen secularavaadi bolkar bhaddi bhaddi gaaliyaan di ja rahi hai
 Should social media gangs not raise the question as to why boys and girls have to hide their face in the campus of the central government institute amidst the security of CRPF and police
 is tasviir main ladkiyaan haath jode khadi hai
 i had not seen such type of request, usually the fists are waved in the performance of the students
 chaatr maanav sansaadhan mantri ko pukaar rahe hai or pradhanmantri se insaaf kii guhaar laga rahe hai
 At the same time, students stayed in the Chinar Ground all day
 unka kahana he ki ve raat ko bhi yaheen date rahenge
 Neeta Sharma has spoken to the parents of the students
 ve apane bacchon kii suraksha ko lekar kaaphi chintit hai or ve bhi is raay ke hai ki maujuuda halaat main NIT ko shift kiya jaae yaa unke bacchon kaa duusare NIT main tabadalaa kiya jaae
 There is no assurance or statement from the Central Government about this
 aapane buudhvaar ko ek video dekha hoga jisamen sthaneey police adhikariyon, maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii team ke saath chaatro kii ek sabha ho rahi he
 Seeing this video, it seemed that all the demands of the students would have been accepted and action would have been taken against the officers of Jammu and Kashmir Police
 darasal iskaa thik ulta hua he
 i will give you further information is video main aap dekhenge ki chaatr manch par khadey hokar bataa rahe hai ki unki maange kya hai
 J&K Police officers should be removed, nits should be shifted out of the state
 shikshakon ko hataaya jaae
 i wish students of Hyderabad and JNU would get such an opportunity but FTII students got such an opportunity
 kendriya soochna mantri ne unase baat to kii thi
 Even if their demand is not accepted
 video main chaatr kaaphi utsahit hai magar ab ashankit hai ki unki ladaai kisi manzil par pahonchegi bhi yaa nahin
 No action has been taken against any officer of Jammu and Kashmir Police
 ulta police ne todphod ke aarope main do chaatro ke kilaaf exiaar kar di he
 According to reports, the NIT administration is thinking of taking action against 31 students
 gair kashmiri chaatr jisamen duusare rajya ke sabhi dharmon ke chaatr hai, hindu muslim sikh isai sab hai unamem se kuch kaa kahana he ki ve is masale ke sampradayikaran ke kaaran funs gaye hai
 Two videos have appeared
 ek video chaatro kii taraf se or unke baad police kaa jisamen chaatro ko tod phod karte dikhaaya gaya he
 These pictures have been given by the students, in which the police are surrounded and brutally beating a student
 ek chaatr par paanch chah police vaale tut pade hai
 Seeing these photos, it was seen that the police brutalized the students, which is also visible
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki chaatraon ko bhi peeta gaya he or shaareerik chunautiyon kaa saamana kar rahe chaatro ko bhi peeta gaya
 The students say that they are being threatened from failure to rape
 thodi der ke baad police ne apni taraf se ek video jari kiya
 In this video of the police, students are throwing stones at a car
 todphod kar rahe hai
 Stoning the police
 ab yah saaf nahin he ki pehle chaatro ne pathar maaraa yaa phir police kii lathi ke baad chaatro ne todphod kii
 All this is a matter of investigation
 media ise is tarah pesh kar rahaa he ki deshbhakton par lathi kyon, kai log deshbhakti kaa yah sawaal kuch agyaat secularavaadiyon ko gariyaane ke liye kar rahe hai
 But you look with your eyes and think with your mind as to whose orders the sticks went, why the confrontation took place
 do tarah ke video hai or kai tarah kii afvaah
 Decide
 media ke anusaar ye deshbhakt hai to inke khilaaf enaiti karrwai karne kii baat kyon kar rahaa he
 Why did the police file an FIR
 india today website ne likhaa he ki aresas samarthit jammu kashmir study cirkil kaa kahana he ki aisa nahin he ki sabhi kashmiri chaatr baahar se aane vaale chaatro ke kilaaf hai
 Nor is everyone happy about India's defeat in Kashmiri cricket
 NIT kii ghatana se lagata he ki algaavvaadi tatwon ne shiksha sansthaanon main apni paith bana lee he
 These have to be excluded
 agar vahaan algaavvaadi tatwon kaa asar bad gaya hota to aisi ghatana pehle to nahin hui
 non-kashmiri students themselves have not been able to say anything about the confrontation with the local students before this year
 tirangaa lahraane ko lekar takaraav hua
 But have there been any firs against those who waved the flag of Pakistan? aap sawaal ye puuchhenge yaa do chaar patrakaron par bhadaas nikaalenge
 An inquiry committee was set up
 puure desh main jeenyu kii tarah afvaahen failaa di gayi hai or logon ne phir yakeen karnaa shuru kar diya he
 The students' fight is with the college administration
 ve nahin chaahate ki kashmiri chaatro ke khilaaf bhi koi pulisia karrwai ho
 He does not trust the administration of his college
 tippaniyan As a result of this environment, 16 Kashmiri students were suspended from Mewar University in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan till 25 April
 is college main bharat westeindies match ke baad jhadap hui thi
 Before that, 4 Kashmiri boys from here were caught on the charge of eating beef, they were also beaten
 baad main police ne kaha ki wetenry board ne apni report main kaha ki jo meet khaaya gaya he wo bif nahin tha
 Forensic investigation is awaited
 enaiti srinagar par aap jitne bhi tathy rakh lijie, aap tak pahonchega vahi jo whatsap ke zariye tarah tarah ke maisejon main dhalkar failaayaa ja rahaa he
 But we'll talk anyway
 vahiin chinar ground main puure din chaatr jamaa rahe
 They say that they will stay here at night too
 nita sharma ne chaatr chaatraon ke mata-pita se baat kii he
 They are very concerned about the safety of their children and they are also of the opinion that in the current situation the NIT should be shifted or their children transferred to another NIT
 is bare main centre sarkaar kii taraf se koi aashwaasan yaa bayaan nahin aayaa he
 You might have seen a video on Wednesday in which a gathering of students is taking place with the team of local police officers, Ministry of Human Resources
 is video ko dekhakar laga ki chaatro kii sari maange maan lee gayi hongi or jammu-kashmir police ke adhikariyon ke kilaaf karrwai bhi ho gai hogi
 Actually, this is exactly the opposite
 jisaki jaankaree aage duungaa
 In this video you will see that the students are standing on the stage and telling what their demands are
 jammu kashmir police ke adhikariyon ko hataaya jaae, enaiti ko rajya se baahar shift kiya jaae
 Teachers should be removed
 kaash aisa mauka hyderabad or jeenyu ke chaatro ko bhi miltaa lekin aisa mauka apatiai ke chaatro ko mila tha
 The Union Minister of Information spoke to him
 bhale unki maang na maani gai ho
 The students are quite excited in the video but are now apprehensive whether their fight will reach any destination or not
 jammu kashmir police ke kisi adhikari ke kilaaf koi karrwai nahin hui he
 On the contrary, the police has filed an FIR against two students on charges of sabotage
 khabaron ke mutabik NIT prashasan 31 chaatro ke kilaaf karrwai karne kii soch rahaa he
 non-kashmiri students, who are students of all religions of other states, Hindu Muslims are Sikh Christians, some of them say that they are stuck because of communalization of the issue
 do video aae hai
 a video by the students and then of the police showing the students vandalizing
 ye tasviren chaatro ke taraf se di gayi hai jinamein police ek chaatr ko gher kar berahami se maar rahi he
 a student has been hit by five six policemen

 "pranam sir", my mother is an Anganwadi servant in Bihar
 unhen pichley 12 maheene se maandey nahin mila he
 The amount of the honorarium is only Rs 3,000 from the Central Government and only Rs 750 from the Bihar Government (total Rs 3,750)
 isi tarah 2016 main bhi aath maheene maandey nahin diya gaya tha
 That 3,000 rupees of a mother's income is a big thing for her, she has been used to working her life for a lifetime
 sarkari aankadon ke anusaar bihar main qareeb 81,000 anganwari centre hai, or unamem 1 sevika or 1 sahayika karyrat hai
 Is there such a huge amount of 3,750 of servants and about 2,000 of assistants, which will be filled by the government treasury by not giving it every month and it will be advertised? Why is the government forcing these forced women to go for forced labor after deciding to pay such low honorarium? Is it because these women will never be able to raise their voice on corruption happening there? After that, can you claim that if 1 rupee is run in my government, then the whole rupee is reached? The honorarium has also been increased to 4,500, like Dhporshankha before the elections, when it should have been increased to 1 lakh
 "bihar kii ek anganwari sevika kii beti kaa patr aayaa he
 i was thinking how to put this letter in front of you
 itane maamuli paise se koi mahila apane vajood kii raksha kar paati he, to yah paisa kitna myne rakhata hoga
 There is a need to review the state
 hamaari rajya vyavasthaaen sad gayi hai
 The possibilities within them are not expanding
 'prime Time' main do baar aashaa varkar par vistaar se kaarykram kiya he
 It is not known how much pain the general audience will feel for the injustice done to the public
 phir bhi hamane isliye dikhaaya ki koi dekhe na dekhe, parde par apana hi dard dekhie
 What happened if the world is not sympathetic ab ek doosraa patr padhie
 Why do i say that India's media is bent on ruining the democracy it has earned
 yah patr aashaa workaron se sambandhit he
 "ravish sir"
 bihar kii aashaa kareeb ek maheene se pradarshan kar rahi hai
 For a month, the entire system of immunization and health department is badly damaged
 vahaan kii local media bilkul is khabar ko nahin dikhaa rahe
 Local journalists ask for 500 rupees to print the news in newspapers
 patna main do din tak 40,000 aashaaon kaa pradarshan hua tha, lekin mukhyamantri yaa unke kisi pratinidhi ne inaki khabar nahin lee
 The district administration has ordered an FIR on the protesting candidates
 maine is par kuch report kii he, lekin hamaari khabar kaa koi asar nahin ho rahaa
 Please mention their performance once in Please Prime Time, it will be very kind
 "bihar main aashaa varkar 1 disambar se hadtaal par hai
 In Patna, a sit-in demonstration takes place in the Gardnibagh area
 12 or 13 disambar ko rajyabar kii aashaa varkar jamaa hui thim
 They are now moving away from Sadar Hospitals and Primary Health Centers across the state
 27 disambar ko aashaa varkar ne rajyabar main rail-chakkaa jam kiya tha
 National news channels can no longer do anything
 vahaan hindu muslim or sarkaar kaa propeganda hi chalegaa
 The issue of public will not work
 channelon ke zariye muddon ke hone vaale khel ko samajhane kii yogyata aam patrakaron main nahin he, janata se kya ummid karen
 It took many years for us to understand their game
 kya ham vah din dekhne ja rahe hai ki janata media ke saamne gidgidaa rahi he ki hamaara dikhaa do, hamaara chhap do, tumhiin maai-baap ho
 God bless this day
 baharhaal, aashaa workaron kaa kaam behad mahatvapurn he
 We have been told that in hospitals, doctors talk to him by 'tadak'
 sharmnaak he
 Asha workers also carry the work of taking pregnant women to the hospital
 ek delivery ke 600 milte hai
 150 of sterilization
 magar kabhi bhi inhen 1,500 rupee se adhik nahin miltaa
 He also does not get on time
 sochie, kisi kaa itane kam paise main kaise chalata hoga
 In Bihar, the amount of Asha Supervisors is increased in the name of increasing many times, below which there are many Asha workers
 inhen bhi kam miltaa he
 Does not get more than 4,000-5,000
 alag-alag rajyon main aashaa workaron ko alag-alag vetan miltaa he
 They demand that government employees be declared and the salary should be 18,000
 pradhanmantri ne oktober main 2,000 rupee protsaahan raashi kaa elaan kiya tha, jo bahuton ko mila hi nahin
 One of their demands is that the incentive money gimmick be discontinued
 isaki jagah selary di jaae
 You can see in these pictures that Asha Worker is performing in unison
 yahaan media nahin he
 There will be news printed somewhere, then in some shore
 media ko loktantr kaa prahari kaha jaataa he, magar aap dekh sakate hai ki media ke bagair loktantr dhadak rahaa he
 Rather the media is not there where the people are asking questions from their system

 ) Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Monday that Smriti Irani, BJP candidate from Amethi Lok Sabha seat, has insulted Amethi by distributing shoes to people here to humiliate Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 priyanka ne fursatganj chauraahey par yojit nukkad sabha main kaha ki smriti janata se jhooth kah rahi hai ki rahul amethi nahin aate
 People here know all the truth
 janata yah bhi jaanati he ki kiske dil main amethi he or kiske dil main nahin
 Many outsiders have come to the election
 unhone kaha 'smriti irani ne logon ko juute baante, yah kehane ke liye ki amethi ke logon ke paas juute bhi nahin hai pahanane ke liye
 She thinks that by doing this she is insulting Rahul ji
 sach to yah he ki vah amethi kaa apmaan kar rahi hai
 The people of Amethi and Rae Bareli never begged anyone '
 priyanka gandhi ne kaha 'aap inako sikhaaiye ki amethi or raibareli ke log apana sammaan karte hai, kisi ke saamne bheekh nahin maangate
 If you have to beg, then those people themselves beg you for votes'
 maaloom ho ki smriti ne haal main amethi ke gauriganj kshetra main ek jansabha main kathith taur par kaha tha ki barauliya gaanv ke pradhan jab unase milane ke liye dilli gayi the to unke pairon main thik se chappal bhi nahin thi
 'I had arranged it then and had given 16 crore rupees for the development of the village'
 congress mahasachiv ne kaha 'amethi main food park banane se kshetra ke paanch lakh kisaanon ko phayda ho saktaa tha
 Why stop the food park, if you (smriti) wish well, will you open a food park in Amethi or distribute shoes? He said, 'you have seen from the ancestors that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi used to go from village to village of Amethi, you should ask your elders
 us vakt aisa koi nahin tha jisase vah naa mili hon
 At the same time, what is the situation in Varanasi? Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not visit any village in his own parliamentary constituency
 priyanka ne kaha ki aaj chote-chote tamaam udyog band ho gayi hai
 Not a single young man at the intersection says that i got employment in these five years
 is sarkaar ke raaj main 50 lakh rojgaar ghate hai
 The same people reduced these jobs who came to power promising to provide two crore jobs every year
 priyanka ne kaha 'main kahana chaahati hum ki is chunaav main congress ko baari bahumat se jitaaiye
 The people of BJP are betraying not only Amethi, but the entire country
 aap sabhi kaaryakarta har ghar jaakar ek-ek vyakti se miliye'

 log in bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne anya mukhya mantriyon ko bataaya ki danda ke jor par keemten kaise ghatai ja sakati hai
 After their decision to control the prices of vegetables, especially onions and potatoes, their prices have been continuously falling there
 bijness paper bijness standard main chhapi ek khabar ke mutabik mamata ne nayaa aadesh jari karke kaha he ki cold storage vaale 15 disambar tak apane store khaali kar den
 This means that the potatoes stored there should be taken out by then
 inhen cold storage main aalu jamaa karke rakhaa jaataa he
 After strict orders from Mamta, potato prices have fallen in Bengal and now they have gone up to Rs 15 to 20 per kg
 ab inamen or bhi giravat kii sambhaavna he kyonki mamata ne bengal ke baahar subjiyan khaskar aalu bhejne par pabandi laga di he
 Bengal is a big potato producing state and there are 10 million tonnes of potatoes every year
 inamen se 55 lakh ton kii khapat bengal main he or shesh baahar ke rajyon khaskar jharkhand, urisa or bihar main bheja jaataa he
 a new crop of potatoes has arrived in the market
 ab kisaanon or vyapaariyon ko unhen turanch bechnaa hoga kyonki ve ise zyada samay tak apane paas nahin rakh sakate
 Frightened farmers are saying that if the Chief Minister remains adamant, thousands of tons of potatoes will have to be thrown on the road
 jo bhi ho bengal main subjiyon ke daam anya rajyon kii tarah oonche nahin he or jamaakhor khel nahin kar paa rahe hai
 But the farmers are also upset because the wholesalers are not even paying them the cost

 shivpal yadav samaajawaadee party ke pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ke bhai hai or is samay uttar pradesh vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh hai
 Shivpal Yadav is contesting once again from Jaswantnagar seat of Etawah district of sp's stronghold
 jaswantnagar seat 1996 se samaajawaadee party ke paas rahi he isliye vahaan se unka jeetna lagbhag tay mana ja rahaa he
 At the time of Azam Khan rejoining the party, Mulayam Singh had given him the post of Leader of Opposition but Azam Khan refused to take this post and thus Shivpal Yadav remained the Leader of Opposition in UP Legislative Assembly
 yah maamla 2001 kaa he
 Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government's direct market policies directly clashed with Swadeshi advocates of Swadeshi
 mukt bazaar ke pakke himachati sinha beemaa, khudara bazaar, shiksha or media jaise kai kshetron ko pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadi) ke liye kholane kii yojana bana rahe the
 In 2001 the Ministry of Commerce under Minister Mursoli Maran also prepared a note approving 100 per cent FDI in single and multi brand retail market
 lekin arthvyavastha ko kholane kaa iraadaa 'aatmanirbharta’ ke swadeshi darshan ke vipareet tha
 This led to a bitter relationship between the NDA government and the RSS, while in terms of ideology, the RSS is considered the watchman of the BJP
 tab sinha kii jagah jaswant singh laae gaye
 In fact, due to strong opposition from the RSS, the government could not approve more than 26 per cent FDI in the insurance sector and could not open the education sector for this
 endie sarkaar 2004 main chunaav haarane ke ek dashak baad phir satta main laut ai he
 The atmosphere has changed a lot during the last ten years
 bhumandalikaran ne desh ke upabhoktaaon kii aakankshaon ko kaaphi badha diya he
 This also gave strength to the domestic industry, which is now moving ahead by competing with foreign companies
 lihaaja, arthvyavastha ko or adhik kholane ke maamle main aresas kaa virodh manda padaa he
 On the condition of anonymity, an RSS thinker says, "high voices of old concerns are no longer heard, but there are some apprehensions
" ” jaahir he, sarkaar kii nitiyon par ab bhi khaasaa asar rakhane vaale aresas ko ehsaas he ki jamini hakikatein kaaphi badal gai hai
 This is indicated by a meeting with RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav

 He says, "our idea of swadeshi is quite broad
 bharat kii aarthik swaittata kii raksha kii jaani chahie
 Areas that are likely to generate employment should be opened for FDI
 ”epadi ke prati aresas kii sweekaaryata aise vakt par ai he jab yah saaf ho chalaa he ki narendra modi kii sarkaar vyaavhaarik nitiyaan apnayegi or kai nae kshetron ko epadi ke liye kholane kii soch rahi he
 Finance and Defense Minister Arun Jaitley has indicated that the government intends to increase the FDI limit in defense production sector from 26 per cent to 100 per cent
 abhi tak raksha mantralay epadi kii seemaa badhaane kaa kadaa virodh karata aayaa he
 The government plans to approve FDI in high-speed trains, suburban train corridors, tracks and rail lines connected to ports and mines, e-commerce and construction sectors
 purv endie sarkaar ke daur ke vipareet ab swadeshi arthshaastra ke pairokaar buniyadi sanrachana or raksha jaise kshetron main epadi kii jarurat se sahamat hai
 There is a possibility of generating employment in these areas and broadening the technology base in the country
 lekin vibhinn kshetron main kis had tak epadi ko manjuuri di jaae, ise lekar kuch ashankaayen-aapattiyaan hai
 Several rounds of talks with RSS leaders suggest that exceptions should be made with 100% FDI and financial services and education will be excluded from foreign investment if they do
 lord meghnad desai jaise mukt bazaar ke pairokaar to aadhunik daur ke bharat main swadeshi ke vichaar ko katai upyogi nahin maanate, balki uske prati hikaarat kaa bhav rakhte hai
 "swadeshi is nothing but a waste of time," he says
 arthshaastra kaa vichaar yah he ki aap chizon ke utpaadan kii chintaa chhodkar behatar banane par apana dhyaan kendrit karen
 a part of the RSS is stuck on Swadeshi but modern ideas have moved forward
 tathakthith hindu rashtravaadi sarkaar 100 fisadi epadi kii baat kar rahi he jabaki kabhi ye log hi videshi technology ke dhur virdohi the
 “with the change, the Jana Sangh, a former version of the BJP, and many other political parties strongly opposed the use of new technology in banks in the 1970s
 unki daleel thi ki isse bahut-se clerkon kii naukari chali jaaegi
 In contrast, now Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP have started talking about 'digital India' construction and cities equipped with IT
 pradhanmantri modi prashasan main technology ko apnaane vaale pehle netaaon main hai
 He used video conferencing to make the process of land acquisition in Gujarat transparent, to troubleshoot villages
 phir, desh ke itihaas main pehali dfa atyaadhunik prachaar abhiyaan chalaaya
 Today, many RSS thinkers have started to argue that they are always in favor of liberalization
 haalanki aresas kii aarthik vichaaron kii shakha swadeshi jaagran manch (esageem) ne bharat ke vishwa vyapaar sanghathan (dablutio) kaa sadsy banane kaa virodh kiya tha
 It says that the RSS has always been opposed to Nehruvian socialism and has been in favor of ending the free market and license-quota raj
 mukt udhyam kii pairokari ke hi kaaran jansangh ko dhani logon kii party kaha jaataa tha
 But despite the advocacy of the free market, the BJP has always been an advocate of maintaining economic control
 purv endie sarkaar ke dauraan party khaskar jaruri jinson or krishi tathaa puunjigat saamaan ke aayaat kaa virodh karti rahi he
 sjm's co-convenor and economic thinker
 gurumurti kaa maananaa he ki berokatoke aayaat hi desh main chaalu khate main phaayde se ghate kii sthiti main pahunch jane kii ek mukhya vajah rahi he
 Current account indicates the status of foreign transactions in the country
 chaalu khate main ghaataa badaae se mahangaai bad sakati he or desh kii mudra kaa avamulyan ho saktaa he
 For the first time since 1978, during the previous NDA government, the current account was worth $ 22 billion
 congress kii aguai vaali sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) sarkaar ke dauraan 2012-13 main chaalu khate main 89 arab dollar kaa kaarobaar darj kiya gaya, jo kisi ek vitt varsh main record tha
 The UPA government attributed the rise in gold and oil imports
 lekin gurumurti kii daleel he ki aisa puunjigat vastuon ke baari aayaat kii vajah se tha, jo endie ke raaj main ausatan prati saal 10 arab dollar se upie raaj ke nau saal (2004 / 05 se 2012 / 13) main badhkar 65 arab dollar ho gaya
 According to Gurumurthy, the production sector almost came to a standstill due to excessive imports of capital goods
 vaaki, upie sarkaar ke pehle chaar varshon (2004 / 05 se 2007 / 08) main audyogic utpaadan vruddhi kii dar ausatan 11
 5 per cent, while in five years after that the growth rate fell to around 5 per cent
 is bich, is avadhi main puunjigat vastuon kaa aayaat bad gaya
 It was $ 407 billion in those five years, for a total of $ 587 billion in nine years
 aise aankadon se pataa chalata he ki utpaadit saamaan kaa aayaat bade paimaane par hua or gharelu utpaadan gir gaya
 This is in complete contrast to the self-reliant economy of Swadeshi
 swadeshi krishi arthshaastri devinder sharma kehete hai, ''hamane aayaat ko manjuuri dekar utpaadan kshetra ko chaupat kar liya
 The capacity of production and service sector in the country should remain intact
 ”lekin khaskar khuli arthvyavastha ke pairokaar kai arthshaastri unase sahamat nahin hai
 Chief Economist and Senior Director at CRISIL d
 ke
 Joshi does not consider the import of capital goods as the reason for the decline in the production sector in the country
 ve kehete hai, ''desh ke utpaadan kshetra main giravat kii vajah kaabiliyat main kami he, chaahe vah buniyadi sanrachana kaa maamla ho yaa bijli kaa
 We need to make our industries competitive
 ”nae daur kaa swadeshidesh ke sakal gharelu utpaada main 50 fisadi yogadan ab bhi asangathit kshetra kaa he
 According to the 2013-14 Economic Survey, around 1
 14 karod log hi korporate kshetra main kaam kar rahe hai
 Nearly 90 percent of the employment is in the unorganized, informal, non-corporate sector, which is largely driven by mutual relationships, not formal financial arrangements
 isi asangathit kshetra ke liye vyapak maahaul taiyaar karnaa swadeshi kaa ek ahm pahalu he
 Policy consultant and economist associated with Ernst & Young D
 ke
 Srivastava says, "by approving FDI in the field of defense, they are not giving indigenous support
" raksha main epadi gharelu utpaadan kii kshamta badhayega, taaki vah aayaat kii purti kar sake
 The modern form of Swadeshi is to achieve state-of-the-art domestic production capacity
 bijepi ne maan liya he ki ab bhumandalikaran kii prakriya ko palata nahin ja saktaa isliye swadeshi kaa aadhunik sanskaran saamne he
 "most senior RSS leaders also believe it
 aresas ke ek vichaarak kehete hai, ''ham ekal brands khudara kaarobaar main videshi brands ko manjuuri denge
 But it is too early to approve FDI in the multi-brand retail business for at least a few years, only then it can be looked at with sufficient economic control
 ” aise videshi nivesh jinase chote vyapaariyon or badhai, rajmistari jaise kaarigaron ke kaam ko nuksaan ho, swadeshi kii avadharana ke vipareet mana jaataa he
 Says Gurumurthy, "swadeshi in defense has nothing to do with foreign investment, but with foreign technology
" bharat sabase bade hathiyaar ayaatkon main ek he, lekin kray kshamta kaa istemaal vah technology kharidne main nahin karata he
 If you do not start the production of weapons, then it is not possible to get technology
 videshi nivesh se aapke paas technology aa jaati he or usamen vikaas hone lagata he to phir koi mudda nahin he
 SJM was severely criticized for opposing India's becoming a member of the WTO
 haalanki uskaa daawa he ki uski baat sahi sabit hui he kyonki dablutio kii vaarta krishi kshetra main sabsidi or audyogic daron par sahmati ke abhaav main tut gai he
 But now it is also beginning to realize that India needs to do business with the rest of the world and should do so on its own terms
 1970 ke dashak main jansangh ke dinon main bharat kaa aayaat or niryaat sakal gharelu utpaada kaa mahaj 7 fisadi tha jabaki aaj vah kareeb ek-chauthai ho gaya he
 Earlier there was a strong emphasis on the consumption of Indian goods and there was opposition to Western goods
 swadeshi sirf utpaadan kshamta kaa hi maamla nahin he, balki uskaa sarokaar yah bhi he ki kya utpaadan hota he
 There is also talk of curbing the consumption of Western goods under this, but the SJM no longer emphasizes this aspect
 arnst and yang se jude arthshaastri shrivastav kehete hai, ''upbhog ke tareeke utpaadan kshamta ke mukaable adhik teji se vaishvik ho rahe hai
 Consumer goods are now quite mixed and there is no opposition as before
 ”ab duniyabar ke deshon ke saath vyapaar or aarthik sambandhon par nae sire se vichaar karnaa hoga kyonki modi sarkaar pehle din se hi sambandhon ko sudhaarney par jor de rahi he
 The NDA government called the heads of South Asia for the swearing-in ceremony and held talks with the visiting Chinese finance minister on trade and economic issues
 arthshaastri shrivastav kehete hai, ''ham donon hi maamalon main dusron par nirbhar hai
 We need to bring in the resources of production and sell our goods abroad
 ”bhale hi bijepi ke chunaav ghoshnaptr main aarthik sthiti sudhaarney ke liye khaas yojana nahin pesh kii gai thi, lekin modi sarkaar gujarat kii aarthik nitiyon se sabak le sakati he
 She can adopt economic nationalism and nationalist economic agenda
 modi ke gujarat main aatmanirbharta ke nehruwadi model ko apanaaya gaya
 The funny aftermath is that the Congress abandoned that model two and a half decades ago
 gujarat ke paanch sarkari upkram duniya kii 500 sabase badi companiyon main shumaar hai
 Gujarat has set an example for successfully running government undertakings
 is tarah modi ke netritv main endie sarkaar china kii tarah kii swadeshi niti par amal karegi, jisase sangh bhi khush rahegaa
 Opposite voices Thus the principle of Swadeshi is keeping pace with the changing economic realities
 lekin swadeshi model ke pairokaron ko kuch kshetron main 100 fisadi epadi ko sweekaar karne main abhi kuch vakt lag saktaa he
 By the way, the possibility of opening the defense sector completely has also raised voices in protest
 aresas ke anushanbee sanghathan bhartiya majdoor sangh ne rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke prastaavit shram sudhaaron ke khilaaf pradarshan shuru kar diya he
 Raje is considered close to Modi
 raaje ne logon ko naukari par rakhane or nikaalane ke niyamon ko aasaan bana diya he
 The labor unions are strongly opposed to this
 swadeshi ke pairokaron ne krishi upkarnon ke kshetra ko kholane kaa bhi virodh kiya he, jiskaa sanket pradhanmantri ne diya tha
 He claims that this will start corporatization of agriculture and will cause huge losses to small farmers
 modi kaa santulan kaa tarikamodi sarkaar apni vichaardhaara kii vajah se nahin, balki vyaavhaariktawaad ke kaaran itnaa bahumat hasil kar pai he
 And if practical economics says that "whatever is good for the country" is indigenous then we can adopt the model of development
 jaisaa ki lord desai kehete hai ki swadeshi kaa vyapak arth saamaanya arthvyavastha hi he
 Perhaps there was never such hope and trust from any Prime Minister in the country
 teesri peedi ke puunjipati hindustan construction ke ajit gulabchand kehete hai, ''ve desh ke pehle gaiyr-samaajawaadee pradhanmantri hai
 There has come a man who has a dream of a prosperous India
 ”yah kahana shaayad sthiti ko kam karke aankna he ki modi ke saamne vishaal agenda he
 At the moment, Modi is seen to strike the right balance with his clear opinion on policies and issues, with an emphasis on making Hindi the official language with kurtas and designer jackets

 What happened to the Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York was astonishing, but the official statements that are coming from there are shocking
 inamen kaha gaya he ki devayani kokisi tarah kii immunity nahin he or unke saath vahi kiya gaya jo aise maamalon main aam aadmi kesath kiya jaataa he
 That is, they were also treated like criminals
 unhen hathkadi lagaai gai, kapade utaakarunaki talaashi lee gai or nashediyon ke saath barrack main rakhaa gaya
 All this on a charge about which no investigation has been done yet
 lekin sabase niraashajanak baat yah he ki america ke adhikariyon ne devayani ko diplomaticimunity dene se inkaar kar diya jo unka haq tha
 Not only this, Devayani has already filed a petition against the maid not only in a court in Delhi but also in the High Court
 yah koi pehla mauka nahin he ki america adhikariyon ne kisi bhartiya shakhsiyat ke saathaisa kiya he

 After the demonetisation is over a month, the statement of r Gurumurthy of RSS that a new note of 2 thousand will also be phased out in some time, can create an atmosphere of uncertainty in the market
 pehle se thande pade bazaar main dukandaar apni 60 se 70 fisadi dukandaaree kho chuke hai or aae din ghoshnaaen unhen bikri or kam hone kii ashanka se grasit kar rahi hai
 Pallavi, who runs a jewelry store in Khan Market, says that earlier people used to buy artificial jewelery from 20 to 40 thousand, but now only 2-4 customers come after waiting all day
 khan market behad manhagi jagah he or aise main dukandaaron kaa kiraaya nikalnaa bhi mushkil ho rahaa he
 People do not have money for essential things only
 lihaaja khan market kii zyaadaatar dukaane khaali hi rah rahi hai
 Recently, the general public appeared happy and satisfied with the statement given by RMS Gurumurthy on the demonetization of 2 thousand rupees
 logon kaa maananaa he ki agar bade note band honge, to kaale dhan par bhi bade paimaane par lagaam lagaana sarkaar ke liye aasaan hoga, saath hi 2 hajaar kaa bada note agar bhavishya main sarkaar band karegi, to isse cashles iconmi ko apane aap hi badhaava milegaa
 Kaushal, standing in the long line of the bank to withdraw money for two hours, believes that some of today's problems can be corrected for tomorrow's great convenience
 sarkaar desh ke liye ye kadam uthaa rahi he, lihaaja agar ham log hi sarkaar ke saath sahyog nahin karenge, to phir desh kaise badalegaa
 Even after one month of demonetisation, common people standing in lines are seen standing with the government
 sarkaar ko bhi is tarah kaa aam logon kaa samarthan kaale dhan ko khatm karne ke liye milanaa behad jaruri he
 But at the same time, the government will have to take some such steps so that people are encouraged to buy in sluggish markets

 gujarat main congress ne bhale hi pichhali baar se acha pradarshan kiya ho
 But this time, veteran Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia has suffered defeat
 modhwadiya ko bijepi ke bhimabhai ne kareeb 2000 voton se haraaya he
 The contest on this seat has been very rough
 bijepi ke bhimabhai ko 72 hajaar vot mili hai or arjuna modhwadiya ko 70575 vot mili hai
 In 1995, Babubhai Bhimabhai Bokhiria defeated Congress's Shashikant Anandlal on this seat
 iske baad 1998 main unhone congress ke ummidavaar shyaal heeralaal gagan ko maat di
 However, the 2002 election was defeated by him
 is baar congress ne arjuna modhwadiya ko pratyaashee banaaya or unhone babubhai ko haraa diya
 Even in 2007, Arjun Modhwadia won this seat
 iske baad 2012 main babubhai bokhiria ne kambek kiya or wo apni seat bachaane main kaamyaab rahe
 He defeated Arjun Modhwadia by about 17 thousand votes
 bokhiria ko 77604 or modhwadiya ko 60458 vot mili
 Babu Bokhiria is a powerful minister of BJP, despite this Congress has been given ticket to Modhwadia
 haalanki, wo pichhlaa chunaav haar gaye the, lekin siyaasi jaankaar maanate hai ki babu bokhiria ko arjuna modhwadiya jaise bade netaa hi haraa sakate hai
 This is the reason why the Congress has accepted this challenge by taking out against Babu Bokhiria instead of finding a safe seat for its senior leader

 unhone kaha ve nahin samajhate hai ki pakistan ke muslim bharat aana chaahate hai or yahaan rahanaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, this bogus concept should not be brought with the bill that Article 14 gives everyone the right to equality
 iran jaaen shiya, ahmadiya bahrainbijepi saansad ne kaha ki jahaan tak ahmadiya orashiaka sawaal he to shiya iran ja sakate hai jahaan unhen manyata he, jabaki ahmadiya bahrain ja sakate hai jahaan unhen musalmaan mana gaya he
 Swamy said that they are Wahhabi fundamentalists of Pakistan who do not consider these two communities as Muslims
 anyathaa puri duniya unhen musalmaan hi maanati he
 Swamy said that Islam is the official religion of the state in these three countries
 isliye shiya or ahmadiya is group main nahin aa sakate hai
 Swamy said that some Muslims have personally come to India from these countries and have sought citizenship here
 jaise ki tarik fateh or or taslima nasrin
 But what happened was Taslima went to Sweden and got her citizenship while Tarek Fateh became a Canadian citizen
 isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki pakistani muslim hamaare desh main aana chaahate hai or rahanaa chaahate hai

 Swamy referred to former Assam CM Tarun Gogoi
 gogoi ne kaha ki baahar se aae dharmik alpsankhyakon ko avaidh nahin mana janaa chahie or unhen naagarikta di jaani chahie
 Article -14 does not stop from amending the citizenship bill, Subrahmanyam Swamy said that Article -14 does not stop from amending the citizenship bill

 Most people start their day by drinking coffee, because drinking a cup of coffee immediately brings energy to the body and you start feeling active
 vahiin kuch log sir dard hone par bhi coffee kaa sahaara lete hai
 But have you ever tried to know when and how much coffee you should drink in a day? According to a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, people who drink 6 cups or more of coffee a day, The risk of heart disease in those people is 22 per cent higher than those who drink only one or two cups of coffee in a day
 haalanki, yah har vyakti ke metabolic rate par nirbhar karata he
 Coffee beneficial or harmful to the body? Several studies have reported that caffeine contains anti-oxidants, which are helpful in reducing the risk of pain, inflammation of the veins, heart attack
 lekin coffee se aapako phayda hoga yaa nuksaan yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki aap ek din main kitni coffee pite hai
 This claim has been claimed in a new study report
 sehatmand rahane ke liye ek din main kitne cap coffee sahi?study kii report ke mutabik, logon ko simit maatra main hi coffee kaa seven karnaa chahie
 The study report states that people should drink only 5 cups of coffee in a day
 6 cap yaa isse zyada coffee pine se dil kii bimariyon kaa khatra 22 fisadi tak bad jaataa he
 If you are also fond of coffee, then keep in mind how many cups of coffee you drink in a day
 yatha samay raja kii badi rani ke garbh se ek sundar kanya ne janm liya
 The king named the girl Savitri
 rajakanya shukla paksh ke chandramaa kii bhaanti dinon din badhane lagi
 Gradually he entered puberty
 uske rup lavanya ko jo bhi dekhtaa us par mohit ho jaataa
 When even after making special efforts of the king, no groom worthy of Savitri was found, he said to Savitri one day, 'daughter! Now you have become eligible for marriage, so search for your worthy groom
 ' Accepting the father's orders, Savitri set out on a golden chariot with qualified ministers to travel
 kuch dinon tak brahmarshiyon or rajarshiyon ke tapowanon or tirthon main bhraman karne ke baad vah rajmahal main laut ai
 Seeing Devarshi Narada sitting with her father, he bowed with reverence at the feet of both of them
 maharaj ashwapati ne savitri se uski yatra kaa samachar poocha
 Savitri said, 'father! Dumatsen's son Satyavan, who lives in Tapovan with his parents, is absolutely worthy of me
 at: maine man se unheen ko apana pati chunaa he
 Narada ji suddenly got shocked and said, 'rajan! Savitri has made a big mistake
 satyawan ke pita shatruon ke dwaara rajya se vanchit kar die gaye hai, vah van main tapasvi jivan vyateet kar rahe hai or andhe ho chuke hai
 The biggest drawback is that Satyavan's age is now only one year left
 naarad ji kii baat sunakar raja ashwapati vyagr ho gaye
 He told Savitri, 'daughter! Now you travel again and select another worthy groom
 savitri sati thi
 He said firmly, 'dad! Whether Satyavan is short or longevity, now he is my husband
 jab maine ek baar unhen apana pati sweekaar kar liya phir main duusare purush kaa varan kaise kar sakati hum? Knowing Savitri's determination, Maharaj Ashwapati married her to Satyavan
 dhire-dhire vah samay bhi aa pahunchaa jisamen satyawan kii mrityu nishchit thi
 Savitri started fasting for four days before that
 pati evam saas-sasur kii ajna se savitri bhi us din pati ke saath jangal main fal-phool or lakdi lene ke liye gai
 Suddenly, while cutting wood from the tree, Satyavan started having severe pain in his head and he came down from the tree and lay in his wife's lap
 us samay savitri ko laal vastra pahane bhayankar akruti vaala ek purush dikhaai padaa
 He was a real Yamraj
 unhone savitri se kaha, 'tu pativrata he
 Your husband's age has ended
 main ise lene aayaa hum
 The comments itnaa kah kar yamraj ne satyawan ke sharir se sookshm jeev ko nikaala or use lekar ve dakshin disha kii ore chal die
 Savitri also followed him
 savitri kii budhimattapurna or dharmayukt baaten sunakar yamraj kaa hriday pigal gaya
 Savitri also received the blessings of her mother-in-law and her father-in-law with good eyes, the father of the kingdom, the father the son of getting the son and the son being the daughter of her husband
 is prakaar savitri ne satitv ke bal par apane pati ko mrityu ke mukh se chin liya
 Watch the video - Ravan is not only bad! pita kii ajna sweekaar kar savitri yogya mantriyon ke saath swarna rath par baith kar yatra ke liye nikali
 She returned to the palace for a few days after visiting the ascetics and pilgrimages of the Brahmarsis and Rajarshis
 usne pita ke saath devarshi naarad ko baithe dekh kar un donon ke charnon main shraddha se pranaam kiya
 Maharaj Ashwapati asked Savitri the news of her visit
 savitri ne kaha, 'pita ji! tapovana main apane mata-pita ke saath nivas kar rahe dyumtsen ke putr satyawan sarvatha mere yogya hai
 Therefore, i have chosen her husband as my heart
 naarad ji sahasaa chaunk uthe or bole, 'rajan! savitri ne bahut badi bhul kar di he
 Satyavan's father has been deprived of the kingdom by enemies, he is leading an ascetic life in the forest and has become blind
 sabase badi kami yah he ki satyawan kii aayu ab keval ek varsh hi shesh he
 King Ashwapati got worried after hearing Narada ji
 unhone savitri se kaha, 'beti! ab tum phir se yatra karo or kisi duusare yogya var kaa varan karo
 Savitri was Sati
 usne dridhtaa se kaha, 'pitaaji! satyawan chaahe alpaayu hon yaa dderghaayu, ab to vahi mere pati hai
 Once i have accepted her as my husband, then how can i select another man? savitri kaa nishchay drudh jaanakar maharaj ashwapati ne uskaa vivaah satyawan se kar diya
 Gradually, the time had also come in which Satyavan's death was certain
 savitri ne uske chaar din purv se hi niraahaar vrath rakhana shuru kar diya tha
 On the order of her husband and in-laws, Savitri also went with her husband that day to take fruits and wood in the forest
 achaanak vriksh se lakdi katate samay satyawan ke sir main bhayanak dard hone laga or vah ped se neeche utarkar patni kii god main let gaya
 At that time Savitri saw a male with a fierce figure wearing a red robe
 vah saakshaat yamraj the
 He told Savitri, 'you are a lover
 tere pati kii aayu samaapt ho gai he
 i have come to get it
 tippaniyan After saying this, Yamraj removed the microbe from the body of Satyavan and with it, he went towards the south
 savitri bhi unke peeche-peeche chal di
 On hearing Savitri's wise and religious words, Yamaraj's heart melted
 savitri ne unase apane saas-sasur kii ankhen acchhee hone ke saath rajya prapti kaa var, pita ko putr prapti kaa var or swayan ke liye putr vati hone kaa aashirwad bhi praapt kar liya
 Thus Savitri snatched her husband from the face of death on the strength of Sattva
 dekhen video -sirf bura hi nahin he ravan! Maharaj Ashwapati asked Savitri the news of her visit
 savitri ne kaha, 'pita ji! tapovana main apane mata-pita ke saath nivas kar rahe dyumtsen ke putr satyawan sarvatha mere yogya hai
 Therefore, i have chosen her husband as my heart

 He was a real Yamraj

 Your husband's age has ended

 The comments itnaa kah kar yamraj ne satyawan ke sharir se sookshm jeev ko nikaala or use lekar ve dakshin disha kii ore chal die
 Savitri also followed him
 savitri kii budhimattapurna or dharmayukt baaten sunakar yamraj kaa hriday pigal gaya
 Savitri also received the blessings of her mother-in-law and her father-in-law with good eyes, the father of the kingdom, the father the son of getting the son and the son being the daughter of her husband

 It is about the time when i was studying in 10th standard
 mujhe koching janaa to acha hi nahin lagata tha, lekin na jane kyon meri mummy har baar meri koching laga detii thi
 My mother used to say, 'chhaya Bitiya is very weak in your maths and English
 koi koching kyon nahin jwoin kar leti? nahin to board main niraashaa haath lagegi
 'I used to say what will happen after studying me? Mom, i will apply the broom later
 aap bhi to ghar kaa sara kaam mujhase hi karwaati hai or bhaaiyo se kuch kaam nahin karwaati
 Days passed and the 10th board exam time came
 ek bhai meraa marchent navy main officer ho gaya tha or ek uniwarsity of elahabaad main bikom kar rahaa tha
 Both were very clever
 main hi padhai main kamazor thi
 i took the board examination of 10th standard
 exam ke baad chhutityaan thim
 i was planning to hang out with my friends
 lekin us dauraan man hi man rigelt kaa dar bhi tha
 Sometimes there were dreams of results at night
 jaise-jacerioltka din paas aa rahaa tha vaise-vaise meri dil kii dhadkan badhati ja rahi thi
 On 28th May, when sleep was about to come, the morning sleep automatically opened
 us din maine sabase pehle khaanaa khaaya
 Actually, Papa used to stop eating only when there were low numbers
 maine apane bhaaiyon ke saath aisa hote hue dekha tha isliye mujhe anubhav tha
 Well, when the result came, my brother called from Allahabad to say the roll number quickly, i see the result
 main role number dene se dar rahi thi ki kahin number kam aae to meri pitayee honi tay he
 i secretly switched off Mummy's mobile and what happened after a while was different
 mere papa mujh par gussa ho gaye or kehane lage ki jaldi se role number bhai ko bhejo
 i know you are going to fail when you are doing this
 mujhe laga kii aaj papa apana sara gussa mujh par hi utaarne vaale hai
 But what happened was nothing short of a miracle
 mere duusare bhai kaa phone america se aayaa or kehane laga ki chaaya bahut achche ank se paas ho gai he
 Just the numbers are less in English
 main phir khushi se jhum uthi
 Now i am doing BA

 Indian tennis player Sania Mirza has said that the controversy over the selection of the tennis team for the London Olympics led to discord between the players and her relationship with Mahesh Bhupathi also deteriorated, but now she forgets it and mixed doubles with Leander Paes i am focusing on winning medals
 ullekhneey he ki bhupati or rohan bopanna ne landan olympics main pes ke saath jodi banane se inkaar kar diya tha, or iske baad pes ko majaboor hokar kam ranking ke khilaadi vishnuvardhan ke saath jodi banani padi
 He will pair with Sania in mixed doubles as part of the deal
 sania ne kaha, "is vivaad se kisi kaa bhala nahin hua
 This created bad blood between us and it is unfortunate
 mujhe khushi he ki yah samaapt ho gaya he or main ab liender ke saath milakar olympics main acha pradarshan karne or padak jeetne par dhyaan kendrit kar sakati hum
 "he said," We should forget it now and concentrate on winning the medal
 liender wimbledon ke final main pahunchaa or yah sakaaratmak baat he
 Me and Mahesh lost and it is unfortunate
 hamen final main khelnaa chahie tha
 " sania ne kaha ki chayan vivaad ke kaaran unke bhupati ke saath rishte bhi kharaab hue hai
 He said, "it was not easy to get that controversy out of my mind and it was bothering me
" maine jo kuch kaha tha, usase aisi sthiti nahin bani thim
 Mahesh and i are very good friends, but our friendship has also broken due to the dispute
 " sania ne kaha ki vah mishrit yugal main bhupati ke saath jodi bananaa pasand karatin, lekin pes ke saath milakar bhi vah padak jeet sakate hai
 Sania said, "I am a forehand player and Mahesh is a backhand player, so i was saying my choice, but i never said whether i would play with a player or not
 main apane desh ke liye kisi ke saath bhi khilne ko taiyaar hum
 "he said," Leander is a very good player and my friend too
 main lambey samay tak unke saath khel chuki hum
 It is an honor for me to play with him in the Olympics
 main acchhee farm main hum, maine bhupati ke saath french open khitaab jeeta
 Paes also reached the final of Wimbledon, so he is also in good form
 hamaare paas padak jeetne kaa acha mauka he
 " sania rashtramandal or asian tathaa effro-asian khelon main padak jeet chuki hai or unhone kaha ki ab vah olympics padak apni jholii main daalana chaahati hai
 He said, "I have 12 medals including Commonwealth, Asian Games and afro-asian Games
 keval olympics padak jeetna rah gaya he, isliye is baar mujhe padak jeetne kii ummid he
 "comments yah poochne par ki kya vah olympics se pehle pes ke saath abhyaas karengi to sania ne kaha, "main liender se nahin mili hum or na hi meri baat hui he
 He was in the Wimbledon final, but could not meet him
 captain espi mishra ne har kisi se sampark kiya or kaha ki vah 23 july tak sabhi ko landan main chaahate hai, isliye main tab vahaan pahunch jaaoongi
 " sania ne kaha, "main america ja rahi hum or san diego main kheloongi
 From there i will go to London and after 23 July i think i will start practicing with Leander
 " vah is vichaar se bilkul bhi sahamat nahin thim ki mishrit yugal main padak jeetna anya kii tulana main aasaan hoga, kyonki isamen 16 team kaa drow he
 Sania said, "I think it is wrong that the mixed doubles event will be easy
 log kah rahe hai ki agar aap do match jeet jaaoge to aap semifinal main pahunch jaaoge or aap padak jeet loge, lekin drow kaaphi kathin he
 The best mixed teams in the world are in the draw, so winning the match will not be easy
 " It is notable that Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna refused to team up with Paes in the London Olympics, and Paes was then forced to team up with lower-ranked player Vishnuvardhan
 vah samjhaute ke tahat mishrit yugal main sania ke saath jodi banaaenge
 Sania said, "nobody has benefited from this controversy
 isse hamaare bich manmutav paidaa hua or yah durbhagyapurna he
 i am glad that it is over and i can now focus on doing well in the Olympics together with Leander and winning medals
 " unhone kaha, "hamen ab ise bhulaakar padak jeetne par dhyaan lagaana chahie
 Leander reached the final of Wimbledon and it is a positive thing
 main or mahesh haar gaye or yah durbhagyapurna he
 We should have played in the finals
 " Sania said that her relationship with Bhupathi has also deteriorated due to the selection dispute
 unhone kaha, "us vivaad ko dimag se nikaalnaa aasaan nahin tha or vah mujhe pareshaan kar rahaa tha
 From what i said, such a situation was not created
 mahesh or main bahut achche mitra he, lekin vivaad se hamaari dosti main bhi daraar padi he
 "sania said that she would have preferred to pair with Bhupathi in mixed doubles, but she can win medals with Paes as well
 sania ne kaha, "main forehand khilaadi hum or mahesh bacand khilaadi hai, isliye main apni pasand bataa rahi thi, lekin maine kabhi nahin kaha ki main kisi khilaadi ke saath kheloongi yaa nahin
 i am ready to play with anyone for my country
 " unhone kaha, "liender kaaphi achche khilaadi hai or mere dost bhi hai
 i have played with him for a long time
 olympics main unke saath khelnaa mere liye sammaan kii baat he
 i am in good form, i won the French Open title with Bhupathi
 pes bhi vimbledon ke final main pahunche hai, isliye vah bhi acchhee farm main hai
 We have a good chance of winning a medal
 " Sania has won medals in Commonwealth and Asian and afro-asian Games and said that now she wants to put Olympic medal in her bag
 unhone kaha, "mere paas rashtramandal, asian khelon or effro-asian khelon samet 12 padak hai
 Only the Olympic medal remains, so this time i hope to win a medal
 "tippaniyan Asked if she would practice with Paes before the Olympics, Sania said, "I have not met Leander and i have not spoken
 vah vimbledon final main the, lekin unase mil nahin saki
 Captain SP Mishra contacted everyone and said that he wants everyone in London by 23 July, so i will reach there then
 " Sania said, "I am going to America and play in San Diego
 vahaan se main landan jaaungi or 23 july ke baad mujhe lagata he ki main liender ke saath abhyaas shuru karuungi
 "she did not agree at all with the idea that winning medals in mixed doubles would be easier than the others, as it has a 16-team draw
 sania ne kaha, "mujhe lagata he ki yah galat he ki mishrit yugal spardhaa aasaan hogi
 People are saying that if you win two matches, you will reach the semi-finals and you will win the medal, but the draw is quite tough
 duniya kii sarvshereshth mishrit timen drow main shaamil hai, isliye match jeetna aasaan nahin hoga

 Clothes play an important role in enhancing your personality, so some things are important to keep in mind to save them for a long time
 oonee kapadon ko dry clin karaaen, jabaki safed kapadon ko alag se dhoen
 Designer Divyam Mehta and designer Gaurav Shah have given these suggestions related to easy care of clothes: 1
 kapadon kii almaari ke har bhaag main routine ke hisaab se istemaal main laae jane vaale kapade rakhen, jaise rojaanaa pahane jane vaale kapade alag hisse main rakhen, sportsware, shaam ko pahane jane vaale yaa party main pahane jane vaale or raat ko pahane jane vaale kapade alag hisse main rakhen
 2
 kapadon ko lambey samay tak behatar sthiti main banaae rakhane ke liye unhen fabric ke hisaab se dhoen
 Woolen and silk clothes are just dry cleaned and press them at the appropriate temperature
 3
 The clothes of cotton and linen should be washed by hand and dried in the shade
 bune hue kapadon ko sapaat sukhaana chahie
 Hanging these clothes may damage their shape near the neckline
 4
 Always wash white clothes separately from other colors, because they are likely to be colored by other colors
 5
 Buy clothes with good fabric so that they last longer
 fishan kii chamak-damak main kuch bhi na kharid len, kyonki ye zyada din nahin tikte
 6
 chaahe sari ho, lahanga, dupatta yaa blouse, in kapadon ko safed sooti cover main sahej kar rakhen

 On the evening of 18 September 2016, the then army chief Dalbir Singh Suhag was in Uri, on the same morning militants attacked the Army Brigade headquarters, in which 19 Indian soldiers were martyred
 general suhaag ne uri main hi yah tay kar liya tha kielosi ke paar sainya oparationako anjaam dene kii jarurat he
 The General was certain that the soldiers' death was to be avenged
 sargical strike ke mudde par ab tak bolne se inkaar karne vaale general dalbir suhaag ne india today se baatcheet main sargical strike par chuppi todate hue iskaa khulaasa kiya
 General Suhag retired from the army last December
 pehle nahin hua aisa koi oparationaritred general ne is baat kaa bhi khulaasa kiya ki pakistan adhikrut kashmir main anjaam di gai 2016 kii sargical strike apane tarah kii pehali sainya karrwai thi, jise raajnneetik manjuuri mili thi
 Earlier operations were marked and do not require the consent of the government
 sahaj or chinhit sthanon par kiye gaye oparation kii vyakha karte hue suhaag ne kaha ki pichley saal hui sargical strike kii tulana sena dwaara kiye gaye anya oparation se nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Because those operations did not have political consensus
 bahut pehle shuru ho gai thi sargical strike kii yojanasargical strike ko koun si cheez anya oparations se alag karti he ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki is tarah ke oparation pehle anjaam nahin die gaye jisamen ek saath 250 kilometre ke daayre main kai aatanki thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya ho
 Suhag revealed that even though the Uri Brigade headquarters was attacked on September 18 and action was taken to avenge it directly, the plan to carry out a surgical strike had begun much earlier
 myanmar main karrwai ke baad bani strike kii yojanapurv army chif ne kaha ki elosi ke us paar sargical strike karne kii yojana 2015 main myanmar main enessien (ke) ko nishaanaa banane ke liye hui cross border karrwai ke baad shuru hui
 Let us know that after the martyrdom of 18 soldiers in a militant attack in 2015, a special squad of the Indian Army went across the border to target the Naga militants
 nordarn army commander ne shuru kii taiyaari or traininggeneral suhaag ne kaha ki myanmar main oparation ke baad unhen spasht ho gaya tha ki aatanki hamale hone par army ko kashmir main elosi ke paar hamale karne ke liye kaha ja saktaa he
 He said that it was clear that if there is a terrorist attack, then such action can be asked
 suhaag ne tunrat nordarn army commander ko is bare main plan taiyaar karne or training shuru karne ko kaha
 When Prime Minister Modi reviewed the surgical strike plan, when did General Suhag feel that his army needed to launch a cross LOC strike in enemy territory? This was also the time when General Suhag visited the Uri Brigade after the terrorist attack
 unhone kaha ki mujhe spasht tha ki sainikon kii shahadat kaa badla lenaa he
 The Army prepared some plans for it and later it was reviewed by the Modi government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself reviewed it
 'sarkaar kii chintaa thi, sainikon kaa waapas aana'suhaag ne kaha ki nai dilli main army headquarter main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko is bare main jaankaree di gai
 The biggest concern of the Prime Minister and the government was to ensure that all the soldiers return safely
 agar koi hataahat bhi hota he, to uski body ko peeche na choda jaae
 He said that the Narendra Modi-led NDA government took a bold decision by allowing strikes and relying on the army
 sitambar 28 or 29 kii raat ko sargical strike launch kii gai, joki 2015 main myanmar main kii gai karrwai ke mukaable zyada mushkil thi
 Operation was more difficult than in Myanmar
 Operation Suhag in pok said that the operation to carry out the operation in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir was more difficult
 bharat-pakistan seemaa par donon deshon ke sainik aamane-saamne khadey hai
 It was not at all easy to send soldiers across the loc and bring them back
 'jarurat hui to bharat phir karegaa strike'jab unase poocha gaya ki kya sargical strike anumaanit prabhaav hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi, to suhaag ne kaha ki pichley saal hui sargical strike ke baad bharat ne duniya ko anischitata jaisi cheez kaa parichay karaayaa he
 The general said that there was no major attack on the border after the surgical strike that took place last year
 suhaag ne apni baat general bipin ravat kii baat ko doharaate hue khatm kii or kaha ki agar jarurat padi to bharat, pakistan main phir sargical strike karegaa

 Makkal Nidhi Mayyam (MNM) founder Kamal Haasan, who came to politics from acting, has created a new controversy by saying that Azad was India's first 'extremist Hindu'
 vah mahatma gandhi kii hatya karne vaale nathuram godse (nathuram godse) ke sandarbh main baat kar rahe the
 On this, the BJP said on Monday that the killer is very different from a terrorist
 bijepi ne hasan par vibhaajankaree raajnneeti karne kaa or alpsankhyakon ke tushtikaran ke liye hinduon kii galat chhavi pesh karne main congress tathaa communiston kaa anusaran karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Addressing an election meeting in Aravakurichi, Tamil Nadu on Sunday night, Kamal Haasan said that he is a self-respecting Indian who wants an India of equality where the three colors of the tricolor are retained
 vibhinn dharmon ke sandarbh main unhone tirange ke teen rangon kaa zikr kiya
 He said, 'I am not saying this because it is a Muslim-dominated area, rather i am speaking this in front of Gandhi's statue
 aaazaad bharat kaa pehla ativaadee hindu tha or uskaa naam nathuram godse he
 This is where (extremism) started
 'hasan ne kaha ki unhone ‘swaghoshit rup se apane aap ko gandhi kaa praputra maan liya he'
 Citing the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948, Haasan said that he had come to find the answer to that murder
 hasan ke bayaan par pradesh bijepi ne kadi pratikriya vyakt kii
 The party knocked on the door of the Election Commission and demanded action against Hassan for gross violation of the model code of conduct
 nayi dilli main kendriya raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman (nirmala Sitharaman) ne kaha ki hasan hatyare or aatankwaadi main antar nahin samajhate
 Sitharaman said at the press conference, 'this proves that he does not understand the difference between a killer and a terrorist
 koi hatyara kisi aatankwaadi se bahut alag hota he
 Therefore, if he will read the entire history and simultaneously study the trial of Mahatma Gandhi's murder, then he will know the difference
 'unhone kaha, 'vah yah sabit karne kii jaldbaaji main hai ki vah apni nai raajnneetik party kii khatir alpsankhyakon ke tushtikaran vaali raah par hi chal rahe hai
 Tamil Nadu minister KT Rajenthra Bhalaji reacted disputedly to Hassan's statement, saying that the MNM should bite his tongue on the founder's statement that he was 'the first extremist Hindu of independent India'
 ' ativaadee kaa koi dharm nahin hota
 Neither Hindu nor Muslim or Christian
 annadramuk ke varisht netaa balaji ne emenem par hinsa ke beej bone kaa aarope lagaate hue us par pabandi kaa bhi anurodh kiya
 He accused Haasan of pretending to garner minority votes
 haalanki congress or dravid kashgam ne emenem netaa kaa samarthan kiya
 TNCC president KC Alagiri said he agreed with Haasan 1000 per cent, while DK chief k Veeramani said that Godse was trained by the RSS
 is mudde par patrakaron ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue alaagiri ne aarope lagaaya ki aresas jaise hindu sanghathan virdohi vichaaron ko kuchalane main vishwaas karte hai
 Alagiri said, "I support him and agree with him not only 100 percent but 1000 percent
" 'pradesh bijepi adhyaksh tamilisai saundarrajan ne kaha ki mahatma gandhi kii hatya se puraa desh sakate main tha, lekin koi isko jaij nahin tehra saktaa
 He said that Godse was hanged for this heinous crime
 unhone kaha ki yah nindaneey he ki hasan ne muslim bahul ilaake main ‘hindu atvaad' shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 Soundararajan said in a statement, "although he talks of doing a new kind of politics, he is doing the old, clever, poisonous and divisive politics of the vote bank
 ' unhone kaha ki hasan kaa bayaan sampradayik hinsa bhadakaane ke baraabar he
 The BJP leader said, 'therefore, the election campaign of such a person should be stopped
 police ko is silsile main karrwai kerani chahie kyonki tanaav badhaane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 Actor Vivek Oberoi also criticized Haasan, saying that both art and terrorism have no religion
 unhone poocha ki kya muslim vot hasil karne ke liye godse ke dharm kaa zikr kiya gaya
 Oberoi, who plays Narendra Modi in a biopic on the Prime Minister, said that no one should divide the country
 unhone ek twit kiya, ‘priy camel sar, aap bahut bade kalakaar hai
 Just as there is no religion in art, terrorism has no religion
 aap kah sakate hai ki godse aatankwaadi tha lekin aapane hindu shabd kaa istemaal kyon kiya? isliye ki aap muslim bahul ilaake main vot hasil karne kii koshish kar rahe the?' unhone kaha, ‘kripaya sar is desh ko baante nahin, ham sabhi ek hai jai hind
