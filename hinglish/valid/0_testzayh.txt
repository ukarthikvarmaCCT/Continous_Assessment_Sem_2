 International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories
 
 adhikansh deshon main, yah sakal gharelu utpaada ke mahatvapurn ansh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 While international trade has been present for most of its history, its economic, social and political importance has begun to increase in recent centuries
 antarrashtriya vyapaar vyavastha par audyogikaran, unnat parivahan, vaishvikaran, bahurashtriya nigam or bahyasrot se kaarynishpaadan, in sabhi kaa vyapak prabhaav padataa he
 Increasing international trade is important for the continuation of globalization
 antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bina, desh sirf apni khud kii seemaa ke bheetar utpaadit maal or sevaaon tak simit rah jaaenge
 International trade is no different from domestic trade in principle because the motivation and behavior of the parties involved in a trade does not change fundamentally, regardless of whether the trade is cross-border or not
 mukhya antar yah he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar aam taur par gharelu vyapaar se adhik mahangaa he
 The reason for this is that a border usually imposes additional charges such as tariffs, periodic costs due to delays on the border and costs associated with country variations such as language, legal system or culture
 gharelu or antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bich ek or antar yah he ki puunji or shram jaise utpaadan kaarak aam taur par baahar kii tulana main deshon ke bheetar adhik gatisheel hote hai
 Thus international trade is mostly limited to the trade of goods and services and only on a small scale in trade of capital, labor or other factors of production
 In addition, trade in goods and services can act as a substitute for trade in production factors
 utpaadan kaa ek kaarak aayaat karne ke bajaay, ek desh maal aayaat kar saktaa he jo utpaadan ke kaarak kaa gahan istemaal kare or is prakaar sambandhit kaarak ko sammilit kar le
 ek udhaaharan he, china se sanyukt rajya america dwaara shram-pradhan vastuon kaa aayaat
 chini shram kaa aayaat karne ke bajaay america, china se aise maal aayaat kar rahaa he jise chini shram ke istemaal se utpaadit kiya gaya he
 International trade is also a branch of economics, which together with international finance forms the broad branch of international economics

 The Ricardian model focuses on comparative advantage and is perhaps the most important concept in international trade theory
 ek ricardian model main, desh un chizon ke utpaadan main visheshgyata hasil karte hai jin chizon kaa utpaadan ve acha karte hai
 Unlike other models, the Ricardian framework predicts that countries will specialize instead of producing a wide range of goods
 iske alaava, ricardian model kaarak nidhi par sidhe vichaar nahin karata, jaise desh ke bheetar shram or puunji kii saapeksh maatra
 ricardin model kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki yah deshon ke bich praudyogiki bhinnataaon kii kalpana karata he
 The technology gap is easily incorporated into the Ricardian and ricardo-sraffa models
 ricardian model nimnlikhit anumaan lagaataa he: The Ricardian model makes short-term measurements, so the technology varies internationally
 yah is tathy kaa samarthan karata he ki desh apane tulanaatmak laabh kaa paalan karte hai or visheshgyata ke liye anumati dete hai
 The Ricardian business model was studied by Graham, Jones, Mackenzie and others
 sabhi siddhanton main madhyavarti maal, vasteen or puunjigat maal jaise vyapaarit input maal ko baahar rakhaa gaya
 mckenzie, Jones, and Samuelson emphasized that considerable profits would be lost by the exclusion of intermediate goods from trade
 In a famous comment Mackenzie stated that "the idea of a moment would explain to a person that Lancashire would be unlikely to produce cotton cloth if cotton had to be grown in England
" haal hi main, is siddhant ko vistaarit karte hue isamen vyapaarik madhyavarti maamle ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 Thus the "labor only" assumption was removed from the theory
 is prakaar nayaa ricardian siddhant, jise kabhi-kabhi ricardo-srapha model kaa naam bhi diya jaataa he, saidhantik rup se puunjigat vastuon ko shaamil karata he jaise mashine or samagriyaan, jinka deshon ke bich kaarobaar hota he
 In times of global trade, this assumption is more realistic than the heckscher-olin model, which assumes that capital is stable within the country and not internationally dynamic
 1900 ke dashak ke armbh main, do swedish arthshaastriyon, eli heksher or bertil olin ne kaarak anupaat siddhant naam ke ek antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant kaa srijan kiya
 This theory is also called the heckscher-olin theory
 heksher-olin siddhant is baat par jor detaa he ki deshon ko aise maal kaa utpaadan or niryaat karnaa chahie jise aise sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho, jo prachur hon or aise maal kaa aayaat karnaa chahie jise alp-aapurti vaale sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho
 This theory differs from the theories of comparative advantage and absolute advantage because these theories focus on the productivity of the production process for a particular commodity
 iske vipareet, heksher-olin siddhant kahata he ki ek desh ko utpaadan or niryaat main un karkon kaa upyog karte hue visheshgy hona chahie jo sabase prachur maatra main hon or isliye saste hon
 un maal kaa utpaadan naa karen, jaisaa ki pehle ke siddhanton ne kaha, jo ve sabase adhik kushalta se utpaadit karte hai
 The Heckscher – Olin model was constructed as an alternative to the Ricardian model of basic comparative advantage
 isaki adhik jatilta ke baavjood yah apane purvanumaanon main adhik sateek sabit nahin hua
 But from a theoretical point of view it provides an elegant solution by incorporating neo-classical value mechanisms into international trade theory
 is siddhant kaa tark he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar kaa pattern, kaarak nidhi main antar se nirdhaarit hota he
 It predicts that countries will export goods that use locally abundant factors and will import goods that use factors that are locally scarce
 H-O model ke saath anubhavjanya samasyaayein, jise leontiff virodhabhas ke rup main janaa jaataa he, wesile leontiff dwaara anubhavjanya pareekshanon main saamne ain jinhone paaya ki puunji kii bahutayat hone ke baavjood america shram-pradhan maalon ko niryaat kar rahaa tha
 The HO model makes the following main assumptions: H-O siddhant ke saath samasya yah he ki yah puunjigat vastuon ke vyapaar ko shaamil nahin karata he 
H-O siddhant main, shram or puunji, prayek desh ke liye sthir padaarth hai
 In a modern economy, capital goods are traded internationally
 madhyavarti vastuon ke vyapaar se laabh kaaphi hota hai, jaisaa ki samuelson dwaara bal diya gaya tha 
 Many economists prefer the Heckscher – Olin theory than the Ricardo theory, as it makes less straightforward assumptions
 1953 main, wesile leontiff ne ek adhyayan prakashit kiya, jahaan unhone heksher-olin siddhant kii vaidhata kaa pareekshan kiya
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki anya deshon kii tulana main america puunji main adhik prachur tha, isliye america puunji-pradhan maal kaa niryaat kar rahaa tha or shram-pradhan maal kaa aayaat
 leontiff ne paaya ki aayaat kii tulana main america kaa niryaat kam puunji-pradhan tha
 After the Leontief paradox emerged, many researchers tried to save the heckscher-olin theory, either by new methods of measurement, or by new interpretations
 Leamer emphasized that Leontief did not correctly interpret the HO theory and claimed that contradiction did not occur with a correct interpretation
 brechar or choudri ne paaya ki, agar limar sahi tha, to america mazaduron kii prati vyakti khapat, mazdooron ke vishwa ausat khapat se kam honi chahie
 Later several other tests took place but most of them failed
 kai prasiddh pathyapustak lekhak, jinamein shaamil hai krugman or obstfeld or boven, holender or vien, H-O model kii vaidhata ke bare main nakaaratmak hai
 
 After testing a long history of empirical research, Bowen, Hollander, and VN concluded: "recent tests of the factor abundance theory that directly examine the HOV equations also indicate a rejection of the theory"
 : 321 heksher-olin siddhant ko dakshin-uttar vyapaar samasyaon kaa vishleshan karne ke liye acchhee tarah anukulit nahin kiya gaya he
 Estimates of HO are less realistic regarding NS than NN trade
 uttar or dakshin ke bich aay bhinnata hi ek aisi chiz he jisaki teesri duniya ko sabase zyada parvaah hoti he
 The factor price equalization has not shown much sign of recovery
 HO model maanata he ki deshon ke bich samaan utpaadan kaary karata he
 This is very unrealistic
 viksit or vikasshil deshon ke bich praudyogiki kii bhinnata, garib deshon ke liye chintaa kaa mukhya vishay he
 In this model, labor mobility between industries is possible, while capital is stable between industries in the short term
 is prakaar, is model ko heksher-olin model ke ek 'alpakaaleen' sanskaran ke rup main vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 The specific factor name refers to what is provided, in the short term, specific factors of production such as physical capital are not easily transferable between industries
 siddhant yah suzav detaa he ki agar maal kii keemat main vruddhi hoti he, to us maal ke vishisht sandarbh main utpaadan ke kaarak ke maalikon ko vaastavik rup se acha laabh hoga
 In addition, owners of specific factors of anti-production are likely to have opposing agendas when they seek favors to control labor immigration
 iske vipareet, puunji or shram, donon ke maalikon ko puunji nidhi main vruddhi se vaastavik rup main laabh hota he
 This model is ideal for particular industries
 yah model aay vitaran ko samajhane ke liye adarsh he lekin vyapaar kii paddati kii charchaa karne ke liye bhadda he
 New business theory tries to explain many facts about trade, which is difficult for the two main models outlined above
 isamen yah tathy bhi shaamil he ki zyaadaatar vyapaar, samaan kaarak bandobasti or utpaadakta str or maujuud bahurashtriya utpaadan kii badi maatra vaale deshon ke bich hota he
 In one example of this framework, the economy exhibits monopoly competition and increasing profits on a scale

 Regulation of international trade is done globally through the World Trade Organization and through many other regional arrangements such as MERCOSUR in South America, the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, and European between 27 independent countries Union

 Of particular importance is the role of governments in deciding whether they will allow international businesses to setup their operations and encourage them to grow and succeed
 aksar, kai deshon kii sarkaron ke liye ek vikalp nahin he lekin antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat karne ke rup main ve "nakadi" yaa dollar kii jarurat he, kyonki ve bhi janaa jaataa he
 For example, the difference between exports and imports is known as current account deficit or CAD

 Then, governments can borrow losses at high rates or finance losses through FDI or foreign direct investment and equity flows from fiis or foreign institutional investors to the stock markets
 iske alaava, gharelu udyog kshamtaaon ko ek vishesh kshetra he or na hi visheshgyata he ki kshetra kaa vikaas karne main safal hone ke liye nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, FDI becomes necessary for the development of that region

 For this reason, many governments in developing countries are doing something to encourage and allow foreign investment in international businesses to operate the setup in their respective countries
 haalanki, ek hi sarkaron kii nitiyon ko jari rakhane yaa nahin kaarak he ki sarkaron kii vaicharik tula, raajnneeti kii majaburiyon, or tathy yah he ki videshi nivesh kii yojana banaai arthvyavastha ke rup main shuru kik main safal nahin ho saktaa he shaamil kii ek mejabaan par nirbhar karata he
 The important aspect here is that many governments in emerging economies often welcome international businesses with open arms because of the above reasons
 haalanki, bich main hi prakriya ke madhyam se, unamem se kuch nitigat pakshaaghaat kii vajah se thand pair viksit karne, or karkon se upar soochibaddh he
 It is understandable that allowing international businesses to enter emerging economies needs to be bipartisan meaning that there should be a broad consensus on the issue from all stakeholders

 In addition, competition for foreign capital is so intense that the process in an adverse economy and therefore, the process must be continued and the reason given incentives affect international businesses

 Apparently, the other title is Brahmabhatt in Gujarat denoting barot and there are many stories behind them being called as barot
 Brahmabhatt yaa barot upasthit kiya gaya he or pashchim, uttar-pashchim or uttar bharat ke itihaas main ek bahut hi mahatvapurn or mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 Presently often sent along the land of Gujarat due to their large number of population, the Brahmabhatts are found present in this province from the 11th and 12th centuries onwards during the 7th and 12th centuries during many migrations of Gujarat and Saurashtra

 Significantly, during the feudal era, and after the wild invasions and subsequent invasions, the socio-economic picture of the emerging poor India inspired other tribes and castes to also indulge in the fields and profession of Brahma Bhatt, eventually as Posing and presenting oneself as Bhat / Bhatt / Brahmabhatta, which would result in literature and poetry of superficial and excessive nature

 Such as 1

 Brahmbhatts were given due respect in society and called 'deviputra'
 ve 'rajdarbar' ek kavi yaa raja ke salaahkaar ke rup main hua karata tha
 It remained in practice for a long time through the feudal era that only Brahmbhatts had the right to speak against the king or interfere in their negotiations about the verdict
 vahaan ek 'koi raja ghodo rokvano hakk Fakta barot nej' gujarati main kah rahaa he iskaa matlab he, 'keval barot raja ke ghode ko rokane kaa adhikaar he'
 Brahmbhatts are very ready wit, as it is said, Goddess Saraswati is placed on their tongue and this is why Brahmbhatts may have got the nickname of 'barot' = Bar + Hoth, even Birbal was Barot

 During Gayekead's reign in Gujarat, many Brahmbhatts were converted to barot while raiding people because 'baharvatiya' were only going to 'bava, Baman and Barot'

 Primarily Vahivancha Barots / Bhats and other such groups denoting the lower layers and categories used to work in Gujarat to keep ancestral records of Brahmbhatts and gradually, they too started being considered as a low caste barot

 However, the practice of genealogy has almost ended and those rare manuscripts of some of the most famous Vahivancha Barots of ancient times throughout India, referring to ancient times and history, are a fine piece of empirical historical data with a great disregard which Showing down can help in the direction of correct and correct some great authentic chapters of Indian history

 Even at that time, as the Barots were advisors and very close to the king, they asked the king to put the barot caste on the SEBC list

 Currently, even today, Brahmabhatts majorly branches and occupies the fields of administration, defense, security, arts, literature, theater, administration, consultants, diplomacy, consultancy, law and jurisdiction and such infrastructure
 aryabhat Aryabhata was a great astrologer and mathematician of ancient India
 inhone aryabhatiy granth kii rachana kii jisamen jyotishshastra ke anek siddhanton kaa pratipaadan he
 In the same book, he has written his birthplace Kusumpur and the birth term Saka Samvat 398
 bihar main vartmaan patna kaa pracheen naam kusumpur tha lekin aryabhat kaa kusumpur dakshin main tha, yah ab lagbhag siddh ho chukaa he
 According to another belief, he was born in the Ashmak country of Maharashtra

 Therefore, after a long journey, he completed his compositions in Rajsanidhi, located in Kusumpur near modern Patna
 aryabhat kaa janm-sthanyadhyapi aryabhat ke janm ke varsh kaa aryabhatiy main spasht ullekh he, unke janm ke vaastavik sthaan ke bare main vivaad he
 Some believe that they were born in the region between Narmada and Godavari, known as Ashmaka and they identify Ashmaka from central India, which includes Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, although the early Buddhist text called Ashmaka to the south , As Dakshinapath or Deccan, while other texts describe that the people of Ashmaka must have fought Alexander, according to Ashmaka should be further to the north

 According to the study, Asmaka was a Jain region which was spread around Shravanabelagol and got its name Asmaka due to its stone pillars
 chamravattam is jain basti kaa hissaa tha, iskaa pramaan he bhartapuzha nadi jiskaa naam jainon ke puranic raja bharata ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Aryabhata also mentions King Bharata while defining the Yugas - the fifth verse of the Dasgeetika describes the time passed by the time of King Bharata
 un dinon main kusumpura main ek prasiddh vishvavidhyalay tha jahaan jainon kaa nirnaayak prabhaav tha or aryabhat kaa kaam is prakaar kusumpura pahunch sakaa or use pasand bhi kiya gaya
 However, it is quite certain that at some point he went to Kusumpura for higher education and also lived there for some time

 He used to live there during the last days of the Gupta Empire

 The name Aryabhatiya is given by later commentators, Aryabhata himself would not have named it; This is mentioned by his disciple Bhaskara i in the articles of Ashmakatantra or Ashmaka

 Additionally, some editions also add a few florists to praise the work at the end
 aryabhatiy ne ganit or khagol vigyaan main padya rup main, kuch naveentaayen prastut kii, jo anek sadiyon tak prabhaavshaalee rahi
 The climax of the book's brevity is described in his reviews by his disciple Bhaskara i and by Neelkanth Somayaji in his Aryabhatiya commentary
 aryabhat kaa yogadanbharatake itihaas main jise 'guptkaal' yaa 'suvarnyug' ke naam se janaa jaataa he, us samay bharat ne sahitya, kala or vigyaan kshetron main abhootpurv pragati kii

 Aryabhata holds the most important position among Indian mathematicians
 inhone 120 aryaalandon main jyotish shaastra ke siddhant or usase sambandhit ganit ko sutararup main apane aryabhatiy granth main likhaa he
 He on the one hand represented the value of pi more accurate and sure than the preceding Archimedes in mathematics, while on the other hand it was declared for the first time in astronomy with the example that the Earth itself rotates on its axis
 aryabhat ne jyotishshastra ke aajkal ke unnat sadhano ke bina jo khoj kii thi, unki mahatta he
 Aryabhata had discovered the discovery of Copernicus a thousand years ago
 "golpad" main aryabhat ne likhaa he "naav main baitha hua manushya jab pravaah ke saath aage badhata he, tab vah samajhataa he ki achar vriksh, pashaan, parvat aadi padaarth ulti gati se ja rahe hai
 In the same way, stable constellations also appear to be moving in reverse from the moving earth

 He considered Satyuga, Treta, Dwapara and Kali Yuga as equal

 According to Aryabhata the relation of circumference and diameter of a circle comes to 62,832: 20,000 which is pure to four decimal places
 aryabhat ne badi-badi sankhyaon ko aksharon ke samooh se nirupit karne kityant vaigyanik vidhi kaa prayog kiya he
 The mathematic local value system and the zero-place-value numeral system, first seen in the Bakhshali manuscript of the third century, were clearly present in his works
 unhone nishchit rup se pratik kaa upyog nahin kiya, parantu francisi ganitagya george iffrah kii daleel he ki rikt gunank ke saath, das kii ghaat ke liye ek sthaan dharak ke rup main shunya kaa gyaan aryabhat ke sthaan-mulya ank pranali main nihit tha
 However, Aryabhata did not use Brahmi numerals; Continuing the Sanskrit tradition dating back to the Vedic period, they used letters of the alphabet to denote numbers, expressing quantities as mnemonic
 aparimey ke rup main paiaryabhat ne pai ke sanniktan par kaary kiya or shaayad unhen is baat kaa gyaan ho gaya tha ki pai irreshnal he
 The second part of Aryabhatiyam he writes: chaturaadhikan shatmashtagunan dvarishtistatha sahatranam

 * 8 + 62000 / 2 xxrep 4 0 = 3
1416 Accordingly, the ratio of diameter and circumference is × 8 + 62000) / 2 xxrep 4 0 = 3
1416, which is perfectly accurate up to five significant figures
 aryabhat ne asann, pichley shabd ke thik pehle aane vaala, shabd kii vyakhya kii vyakhya karte hue kaha he ki yah na keval ek sanniktan he, varan yah ki mulya athulaneey he
 If this is correct, then this is a very sophisticated approach, as the irrationality of pi in Europe was proved only by Lambert in 1761
 aryabhatiy ke arabi main anuwaad ke pashchaat bijganit par al khwarijmi kii pustak main is sanniktan kaa ullekh kiya gaya tha
 In Mensuration and Trigonometry: 6, Aryabhata describes the area of a triangle as: tribhujasy falasharerum samadalakoti bhujardhasamavargaiskaa anuwaad he: ek trikon ke liye, ardh-paksh ke saath lamb kaa parinaam kshetrafal he
 Aryabhata has discussed the subject of duality in his work and named it Ardha-jya which literally means "ardha-tantra"
 aasaani kii vajah se logon ne ise jya kahana shuru kar diya
 When his work was translated from Sanskrit to Arabic by Arabic writers, he called it Jiba
 chunki, arabi lekhan main, swaron kaa istemaal bahut kam hota he, isliye iskaa or sankshipt naam pad gaya jb
 When later writers came to understand that JB is a short form of Jiba, they started using Jiba back
 jiba kaa arth he "khoh" yaa "khai" 
 Later in the twelfth century, when Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic jiba with its Latin counterpart sinus, which literally means "lair" or trench
 or uske baad angreji main, sinus hi sin ban gaya
 Indeterminate equations have been of particular interest to Indian mathematicians since yesterday to find integer solutions to equations that are in the form ax + b = cy, a topic currently known as the diophantine equation
 yahan aryabhatiy par bhaskar kii vyakhya se ek udhaaharan dete hai: Find the number that 5 is left as the remainder when divided by 8, 4 as the remainder when divided by 9, 1 as the remainder when divided by 7
 arthath, bataaen n = 8x+ 5 = 9y +4 = 7z +1
 isse n ke liye sabase chota maan 85 nikalataa he
 In general, the diophantine equations were notorious for rigidity
 is tarah ke samikarnon kii vyapak rup se charchaa pracheen vaidic granth sulb sutara main he, jiske adhik pracheen bhaag 800 i

 Aryabhata's method has been called the Kuttaka method for solving such problems
 kuṭṭaka kuttak kaa arth he peesna, arthath chote chote tukdon main todna or is vidhi main choti sankhyaon ke rup main mul khandon ko likhane ke liye ek punaravarti kalanvidhi kaa samavesh tha
 Today this algorithm, according to Bhaskar's interpretation in 621 AD, is the standard method for solving first-order diophantine equations, and is often referred to as the Aryabhata algorithm

 kuch granthon main ve prithvi ke ghurnan ko akaash kii abhaasi gati kaa kaaran bataate hai
 The motions of the solar system seem to be that Aryabhata believed that the earth revolves around its axis

 The next stanza describes the motion of stars and planets as actual motion: udai-astamay-nimittam nityam pravahen vayuna kshipts
 Lanka-sama-west-gas-panjaras-planets confusion "the reason for their rise and fall is due to the fact that the home and Asterisms cycle driven by the Proctor wind continues to move westwards in Sri Lanka
 lanka yahan bumadhya rekha par ek sandarbh bindu he, jise khagoleey gananaa ke liye madhyahn rekha ke sandarbh main samaan maan ke rup main le liya gaya tha
 Aryabhata has described a seismic model of the solar system, in which the sun and the moon move through the home cycle, orbiting the Earth
 is model main, jo paaya jaataa he pitamahasiddhanth, prayek grahon kii gati do grahchakron dwaara niyantrit he, ek chota mand grahchakr or ek bada sheeghra grahchakr
 The order of the planets according to the distance from Earth is as follows: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Constellation grahon kii sthiti or avadhi kii gananaa samaan rup se gati karte hue binduon se saapeksh ke rup main kii gayi thi, jo budh or shukr ke maamle main, jo prithvi ke chaaron ore ausat surya ke samaan gati se ghoomte hai or mangal, brihaspati or shani ke maamle main, jo raashichakr main prithvi ke chaaron ore apni vishisht gati se gati karte hai
 According to most historians of astronomy, this two-planetary model reflects elements of Greek astronomy prior to Ptolemy
 aryabhat ke model ke ek anya tatv sighroka, surya ke sambandh main buniyadi grahon kii avadhi, ko kuch itihaaskaaron dwaara ek antarnihit surya kendrit model ke chinh ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Eclipse He said that the moon and planets shine with reflected light of the sun

 Thus lunar eclipse occurs when the moon enters the Earth's shadow and discusses in detail the size and extent of this shadow of the Earth and then the size of the eclipse part during the eclipse and its calculation
 baad ke bhartiya khagolavidon ne in gananaaon main sudhaar kiya, lekin aryabhat kii vidhiyon ne pramukh saar pradaan kiya tha
 The calculation was so accurate that the 18th-century scientist Guillaume le Gentil, during his visit to Pondicherry, found that the period of lunar eclipse of 1765-08-30 by Indians was calculated to be 41 seconds shorter, while its charts were 68 seconds

 Sun centrality Aryabhata claimed that the Earth rotates on its own axis and some elements of their planetary planetary models rotate at the same speed with which the planets revolve around the Sun

 Aryabhata's work had a major influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and through translation it influenced many neighboring cultures
 islamic swarna yug, ke dauraan iskaa arabi anuwaad vishesh prabhaavshaalee tha
 Some of his results are cited by al-khwarizmi and referenced by 10th-century Arabic scholar al-biruni, who wrote in his description that Aryabhata's followers believed that the earth rotated on its axis
 sin, kosine ke saath hi, varsin kii unki paribhaasha, or vilom sin, ne trikonmiti kii utpatti ko prabhavit kiya
 He was also the first person to construct sine and versatile tables, from 0 ° to 90 ° at 3
75 ° intervals, to a precision of 4 decimal places
 vastav main "sin " or "kosine " ke aadhunik naam aryabhat dwaara prachlit jya or kojya shabdon ke galat uccharan hai
 He was pronounced in Arabic as Jiba and Kojiba

 Aryabhata's methods of astronomical calculation were also very influential
 trikonmitik talikaon ke saath, ve islamic duniya main vyapak rup se istemaal kii jaati thi
 And many Arabic astronomical tables were used to calculate
 vishesh rup se, arabi spain vaigyanik al-jharkaali ke kaaryon main pai jane vaali khagoleey talikaon kaa latin main tolado kii talikaon ke rup main anuwaad kiya gaya or ye europe main sadiyon tak sarvaadhik sookshm panchang ke rup main istemaal main rahi
 The date calculations done by Aryabhata and his followers have been in continuous use in India for practical purposes of determining the Panchang or Hindu calendar, which was also transmitted to the Islamic world, where they formed the basis of the Jalali calendar, which Omar Khayyam in 1073 Including some astronomers, the version of which is presented as a national calendar in Iran and Afghanistan today

 India's first satellite, Aryabhata, was named after him

 Bacillus Aryabhata, a species of bacteria discovered in 2009 by ISRO scientists, is named after him
 tippniyan Chanakya chanakya chandragupta maury ke mahaamantri the
 He is also known by the name 'kautilya'
 unhone nandavansh kaa naash karke chandragupta maury ko raja banaaya
 Economics composed by him is a great book of politics, economics, agriculture, social policy etc

 According to Mudrarakshas his real name was 'vishnugupta'
 vishnupurana, bhagwat aadi puraanon tathaa kathasaritsagar aadi sanskrit granthon main to chanakya kaa naam aayaa hi he, buddha grantho main bhi isaki katha baraabar milti he
 Chanakya's account has been given in the commentary of Vinayapitaka made by Buddhaghosh and the commentary of Mahanam Sthan, composed by Mahanam
 chanakya takshashila ke nivasee the
 The events of his life have a special connection with the accession of Maurya Chandragupta

 It is said that Chanakya used to live in a small hut away from the royal palace
 unke naam par ek dharawahik bhi bana tha jo doordarshan par 1990 ke dashak main dikhaaya jaataa tha
 In the context of Chanakya's conception of the state's conception, Kautilya did not say anything explicitly, but a few coincidental observations made it clear that he favored a social settlement in place of the divine doctrine of the state
 hobbs, lock tathaa ruso kii tarah rajya kii utpatti se purv kii prakritik dasha ko vah araajaktaa kii sangya detaa he
 The state was born when, fed up with the law of 'fishery justice', people chose Manu as their king and agreed to give him one-sixth of their agricultural produce and one-tenth of gold
 iske badale main raja ne unki suraksha tathaa kalyaan kaa uttardaayitv sambhaala
 Kautilya is in favor of the monarchy
 rajya ke tatva : saptang siddhantkautilya ne paashchaatya raajnneetik chintakon dwaara pratipaadit rajya ke chaar aavashyak tattvon - bhoomi, jansankhya, sarkaar va sabhprabhutaa kaa vivaran na dekar rajya ke saat tattvon kaa vivechan kiya he
 In this regard, he does not give a definition of the state, but supports the already existing weekly theory
 kautilya ne rajya kii tulana maanav-sharir se kii he tathaa uske savyav rup ko sweekaar kiya he
 All the elements of the state work like organs of the human body inter-related, interdependent and together

 swami sheersh ke tulya he
 He should be aristocratic, intelligent, courageous, patient, sober, far-sighted and skilled in the art of war
 amaatya rajya kii aankhe hai
 Kautilya has also used this word for ministers, secretaries, administrative and judicial officials
 ve apane hi desh ke janmajaat naagarik, ucch kul se sambandhit, charitravaan, yogya, vibhinn kalaon main nipun tathaa swamibhakt hone chahie
 The state has thighs or legs, on which the existence of the state rests
 kautilya ne upjau, prakritik sansadhano se paripurna, pashudhan, nadiyon, talabon tathaa vanyapradesh pradhan bhoomi ko upyukt bataaya he
 Population includes farmers, entrepreneurs and subjects contributing to economic production
 praja ko swamibhakt, parishramee tathaa raja kii ajna kaa paalan karne vaala hona chahie
 Durgs are the arms of the state, whose task is to protect the state
 raja ko aise kilon kaa nirmaan karwaanaa chahie, jo akramak yuddh hetu tathaa rakshaatmak drushtikon se laabhakaari hon
 Kautilya has described four types of fortifications - Oudic fort, mountain fort, Vanadurga and Dhanvan fort
 kosh raja ke mukh ke samaan he
 The Fund has been considered as the most important element of the state, because money is needed during the operation of the state and during war
 kosh itnaa prachur hona chahie ki kisi bhi vipatti kaa saamana karne main sahaayak ho
 Kautilya has given several measures to increase funds in the fund
 sankatkaal main rajasav prapti hetu vah raja ko anuchit tareeke apnaane kii bhi salaah detaa he
 Punishment is the brain of the state
 praja tathaa shatru par niyantran karne ke liye bal athwa sena atyadhik aavashyak tatva he
 Kautilya has given six types of army
 jaise-vanshanugat sena, vetan par niyukt yaa kiraye ke sainik, sainya nigamon ke sainik, mitra rajya ke sainik, shatru rajya ke sainik tathaa adivasee sainik
 Vaishyas and Shudras can also be recruited in the army in times of crisis
 sainikon ko dhairyavan, daksh, yuddh-kushal tathaa rashtrabhakt hona chahie
 The king should also take care of the comforts of the soldiers
 kautilya ne dandniti ke chaar lakshya bataae hai- aprapya vastu ko praapt karnaa, praapt vastu kii raksha karnaa, rakshit vastu kaa sanvardhan karnaa tathaa sanvakhradhat vastu ko uchit paatro main baantna
 Suhrid is the ear of the state
 raja ke mitra shaanti va yudhkaal donon main hi uski sahaayta karte hai
 In this regard, Kautilya distinguishes between easy and artificial friend
 sahaj mitra kritrim mitra se adhik shreshth hota he
 The destruction of a king whose friends are greedy, coward and coward is inevitable
 is prakaar kautilya kaa saptang siddhant rajya ke savyav swaroop kaa nirupan karte hue sabhi ango kii mahatvapurn bhoomika par prakaash daalata he
 Although this theory does not match the modern definition of the state, Kautilya's kingdom has all four elements of the modern state
 janapad bhoomi va jansankhya he, amaatya sarkaar kaa bhav he tathaa swami samprabhutta kaa pratik he
 The importance of the fund is in the administration, development and promotion and the army is necessary for internal peacekeeping and external security
 videshi maamalon main mitra mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he, kintu durg kaa sthaan aadhunik yug main suraksha-pratiraksha ke anya upkarnon ne le liya he
 Kautilya has also made the concept of monarchy the center of his thinking, following the ancient Indian political thought of the state
 vah loukik maamalon main raja kii shakti ko sarvopari maanata he, parantu karttavyon ke maamalon main vah swayan dharm main bandhaa he
 He is not a lecturer of religion, but a protector
 kautilya ne rajya ko apane aap main saadhy maanate hue saamaajik jivan main use sarvocch sthaan diya he
 The interest of the state is paramount for which at times it even outpaces the principles of morality
 kautilya ke anusaar rajya kaa uddeshy keval shaanti-vyavastha tathaa suraksha sthapit karnaa nahin, varan vyakti ke sarvocch vikaas main yogadan dena he
 According to Kautilya the functions of the state are- suraksha sambandhi kaaryvahya shatruon tathaa akramanakariyon se rajya ko surakshit rakhana, aantarik vyavastha nyaay kii raksha tathaa daivi vipattiyon- baadh, bukamp, durbhiksh, aag, mahamari, ghaatak jantuon se praja kii raksha raja ke kaary hai
 Varnashrama Dharma is emphasized under Swadharma
 yadhyapi kautilya manu kii tarah dharm ko sarvopari maanakar rajya ko dharm ke adheen nahin karata, kintu praja dwaara dharm kaa paalan na kiye jane par raja dharm kaa sangrakshan karata he
 The duty of social responsibility is to establish social justice for the general public
 saamaajik vyavastha kaa samuchit sanchaalan tabhi sanmbhav he, jabaki pita-putr, pati-patni, guru-shishy aadi apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah karen
 In the event of divorce, he emphasizes equal rights of men and women
 strivadh tathaa brahman-hatya ko gambheer aparaadh mana gaya he
 The field of work of the state of public welfare is very wide
 vah rajya ko maanav ke bahumukhi vikaas kaa daayitv saunpkar use aadhunik yug kaa kalyankari rajya bana detaa he
 He has given many tasks to the state
 jaise- band, talab va sinchai ke anya sadhano kaa nirmaan, khaanon kaa vikaas, banjar bhoomi kii jutai, pashupaalan, vanyavikas aadi
 Apart from these, public entertainment was under the control of the state
 anathon nirdhanon, apango kii sahaayta, stri sammaan kii raksha, punakhravvaah kii vyavastha aadi bhi rajya ke daayitv the
 Thus Kautilya's kingdom is the ubiquitous state
 jan-kalyaan tathaa achche prashasan kii sthapana uskaa lakshya he, jisamen dharm va naitikta kaa prayog ek saadhan ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Kautilya says, ‘‘praja kii prasannataa main hi raja kii prasannataa he
 Whatever is beneficial for the subject, it also has its own benefit
 ’’ek anya sthaan par usne likhaa he
 "force is power, authority
" in sadhano ke dwaara saadhy he prasannataa
 "in this regard," says Salatore, "the only purpose of the state which has power and authority is to increase the happiness of its subjects
" is prakaar kautilya ne ek kalyankari rajya ke kaaryon ko uchit rup main nirdeshit kiya he
 '' kootneeti tathaa rajyashilpakautilya ne na keval rajya ke aantarik kaary, balki vahya kaaryon kii bhi vistaar se charchaa kii he
 In this regard, he discusses foreign policy, international relations and rules of war and peace
 kootneeti ke sambandhon kaa vishleshan karne hetu usne mandal siddhant pratipaadit kiya he- Mandal Siddhantam Main article: Mandal Kautilya in his divisional theory described the policy adopted by different states towards other states
 pracheen kaal main bharat main anek chote-chote rajyon kaa astitv tha
 Powerful kings expanded their empire by war
 rajya kai baar suraksha kii drushti se anya rajyon main samjhauta bhi karte the
 According to Kautilya, a king who expanded his empire through war and conquest should increase the number of friends of his enemies, so that enemies can be kept under control
 duusari ore nirbal rajyon ko shaktishaalee padosi rajyon se satark rahanaa chahie
 They should form a group or 'mandal' to avoid expansionary policy of powerful states with the same level of states
 kautilya kaa mandal siddhant bhugolic aadhaar par yah darshata he ki kis prakaar vijay kii ichha rakhane vaale rajya ke padosi desh uske mitra yaa shatru ho sakate hai
 According to this theory, there is a king in the center of the mandal, who is willing to win other states, it is called "vijigishu"
 ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ ke maarg main aane vaala sabase pehla rajya ‘‘ari’’ tathaa shatru se laga hua rajya ‘‘shatru kaa shatru’’ hota he, atah vah vijigeeshu kaa mitra hota he
 Kautilya has also described "moderate" and "indifferent" states, which, despite being powerful, do not participate in the strategy
 kautilya kaa yah siddhant yatharthwaad par aadhaarit he, jo yudhon ko anterrashtriya sambandhon kii vaastaviktaa maanakar sandhi va samjhaute dwaara shakti-santulan banane par bal detaa he
 The six-point foreign policy policy details six types of policies for the operation of foreign relations
 sandhi shaanti banaae rakhane hetu samatuly yaa adhik shaktishaalee raja ke saath sandhi kii ja sakati he
 From the point of view of self-defense, enemies can also be negotiated
 kintu iskaa lakshya shatru ko kaalaantar nirbal bananaa he
 Creation of war against the Deity
 yaan yaa yuddh ghoshit kiye bina akraman kii taiyaari, asana yaa tatasthta kii niti, sanshray arthath aatmaraksha kii drushti se raja dwaara anya raja kii sharan main janaa, dvaidhibhav arthath ek raja se shaanti kii sandhi karke anya ke saath yuddh karne kii niti
 According to Kautilya, these policies should be used by the king only for the welfare of the state
 kootneeti aacharan ke chaar siddhantkautilya ne rajya kii videsh niti ke sandarbh main kootneeti ke chaar siddhanton sam, daam, dand tathaa bhed kaa varnan kiya
 According to Kautilya, the first two principles should be used by weak kings and the last two principles should be used by strong kings, but it is also of the opinion that the value is equal, the price is different and the punishment is better than punishment
 dand kaa prayog antim upaay ke rup main kiya jaae, kyonki isse swayan kii bhi kshati hoti he
 Detective system Kautilya has described in detail the types and functions of detectives
 guptchar vidhyaarthee grihapati, tapasvi, vyapaaree tathaa vish -kanyaon ke rup main ho sakate the
 The ambassadors also played the role of undercover
 inkaa kaary desh-videsh kii gupt suchnaayen raja tak pahunchaana hota tha
 They contributed to assess the state of public opinion, control the rebels and destroy the enemy state
 kautilya ne guptcharon ko raja dwaara dhan va maan dekar santusht rakhane kaa suzav diya he
 Chanakya and Makiavelliyyah are true that Kautilya has described a vast organization of secret systems to protect the nation
 shatrunash ke liye vishakanya, ganika, aupnishadik prayog, abhichaar mantra aadi aniatik evam anuchit upayon kaa vidhaan he or is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye mahaan dhan-vyay tathaa dhan-kshay ko bhi raashtra-niti ke anukool ghoshit kiya he
 Seeing such discussions in 'kautilya Arthashastra', Mudrarakshaskaar poet Vishakhadatta Chanakya has been called untruthful and Banabhatta has condemned 'kautilya Arthashastra' as 'nirguna' and 'atinrushyansprayopadesham'
 'manjushri mulkalp' naam kii ek naveen uplabdh aitihaasik kriti main kautilya ko ‘durmati’, krodhan or ‘paapak’ pukarkar garha kaa paatr pradarshit kiya gaya he
 Many modern Western scholars, who specialize in orientalism, have also compared Kautilya to the famous author and politician Mekiavali of Europe, who, in his book 'the Prince', took the shelter of all the improper means appropriate to achieve the goal
 Has preached vinternitz aadi paashchaatya vidvan kautilya tathaa mekiyavali main nimnlikhit samanthaayen pradarshit karte hai: Both Mekiavali and Kautilya understand the nation as everything
 ve raashtra ko apane main hi uddeshy maanate hai
 The main basis of Kautilya-niti is, 'atmodaya: Paraglani;' That is, to give birth to the loss of others
 mekiyavali ne bhi duusare deshon kii haani par apane desh kii abhivruddhi karne kaa paksh-poshan kiya he
 Both agree equally that for the accomplishment of this purpose the enemy must be destroyed by spending any amount of money and people
 apane uddeshy kii siddhi ke liye kisi bhi saadhan, naitik yaa aniatik, kaa aashray lenaa anuchit nahin he
 Both Mekiavali and Kautilya hold that the only goal of the king should be to prove the Sadhya
 sadhano ke auchity yaa anauchity kii use chintaa nahin kerani chahie
 Both consider war as an essential part of national policy
 donon kii sammati main prayek raashtra ko yuddh ke liye udyat rahanaa chahie, kyonki isi ke dwaara desh kii seemaa tathaa prabhaav kaa vistaar ho saktaa he
 By establishing terror in his subjects, both perseverance and ruling mercilessly propose the same
 donon ek vishaal susangathit guptchar vibhaag kii sthapana kaa samarthan karte hai, jo praja ke prayek parshv main pravesh karke raja ke prati uski bhakthi kii pariksha kare or shatru se sahanubhuti rakhane vaale logon ko gupt upayon se nasht karne kaa ytn kare
 It is not rational to show such similarity in Kautilya and Mekiavali
 nissandeh kautilya bhi mekiyavali ke samaan yathartwaadee tha or keval adarshavaad kaa anuyaayi na tha
 But to say that Kautilya had completely abandoned religion or morality would be contrary to the truth
 kautilya ne ‘arthshaastra’ ke pratham adhikaran main hi sthapana kii he; In the same way, self-righteousness does not commit adultery
 swadharm sandadhaano hi, prety cheh na nandati
 arthath- raja praja ko apane dharm se chyut na hone de
 The king should also conduct his religion
 jo raja apane dharm kaa is bhaanti aacharan karata he, vah is lok or paralok main sukhi rahata he
 In this very first tribunal, emphasis has also been laid by the king on arranging immortals and orders have been given to strengthen varna and ashram system
 yahaan par trayee tathaa vaidic anushthan ko praja ke sangrakshan kaa mul aadhaar batalaaya gaya he
 Kautilya has described the king as the consort of elders from place to place, humble in learning, jitendriya and suppressor of the enemy-conspiracy etc
 aisa raja adharmik athwa atyaachaari banakar kis prakaar praja-peedan kar saktaa he ? iske vipareet raja ko praja ke liye pitru-tulya kaha gaya he, jo apni praja kaa paalan-poshan, sanvardhan, sangrakshan, bharan, shikshan ityadi vaisaa hi karata he jaisaa vah apni santaan kaa karata he
 It is right that Kautilya has also preached to take unethical measures for Shatruksha
 parantu is sambandh main arthshaastra ke nimna vachan ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie: And Dushyeshu irreligious head, not itsu
 arthath- in kootneeti ke upayon kaa vyavhaar keval adharmik evam dusht logon ke saath hi kare, dharmik logon ke saath nahin

 Chanakya considers the above mentioned doshas as natural qualities of women
 haalaanki vartmaan daur kii shikshit striyon main in dosha kaa hona sahi nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 3
 The availability of good substances for food, the power to digest them, the work force for contact with a beautiful woman, the desire to give abundant wealth as well as wealth
 ye sabhi sukh manushya ko bahut kathinata se praapt hote hai
 4
 Chanakya says that the person whose son is under his control, whose wife conducts according to the command and the person who is fully satisfied with his earned money
 aise manushya ke liye yah sansar hi swarg ke samaan he
 5
 Chanakya believes that the same householder is happy, whose children obey their orders
 pita kaa bhi karttavya he ki vah putron kaa paalan-poshan acchhee tarah se kare
 In the same way, such a person cannot be called a friend, who cannot be trusted and such a wife is meaningless who does not get any kind of pleasure
 6
 jo mitra aapke saamne chikani-chupadi baaten karata ho or peeth peeche aapke kaary ko bigaad detaa ho, use tyaag dene main hi bhalaai he
 Chanakya says that he is like a pot that has milk on its top but has poison inside
 7
 chanakya kehete hai ki jo vyakti acha mitra nahin he us par to vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie, parantu iske saath hi achche mitra ke sambandh main bhi puraa vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie, kyonki yadi vah naaraaz ho gaya to aapke saare bhed khol saktaa he
 Therefore, caution is very important
 8
 chanakya kaa maananaa he ki vyakti ko kabhi apane man kaa bhed nahin kholana chahie
 Whatever work he has to do, keep it in his mind and he should complete it with full patience when the time comes
 9
 chanakya kaa kahana he ki morrkhtaa ke samaan yauvan bhi dukhadaayi hota he kyonki javaani main vyakti kamvasana ke aaveg main koi bhi moorkhtapurna kaary kar saktaa he
 But even more painful than these is to depend on others
 10
 chanakya kehete hai ki bachapan main santan ko jaisi shiksha di jaati he, unka vikaas usee prakaar hota he
 Therefore, it is the duty of the parents to lead them on such a path that they develop the best character because only the virtues of the family are enhanced by the virtuous ones
 11
 ve mata-pita apane bacchon ke liye shatru ke samaan hai, jinhone bacchon ko acchhee shiksha nahin di
 Because the illiterate child is insulted in the group of scholars in the same way as the heron in the herd of swans
 shiksha viheen manushya bina punch ke jaanavar jaisaa hota he, isliye mata-pita kaa kartavya he ki ve bacchon ko aisi shiksha den jisase ve samaaj ko sushobhit karen
 12
 Chanakya says that many pampering in children leads to many defects
 isliye yadi ve koi galat kaam karte hai to use nazarandaaj karke laad-pyaar karnaa uchit nahin he
 It is also necessary to scold the child
 13
 shiksha or adhyayan kii mahatta bataate hue chanakya kehete hai ki manushya kaa janm bahut saubhaahgya se miltaa he, isliye hamen apane adhikadhik samay kaa vedadi shastron ke adhyayan main tathaa daan jaise achche kaaryon main hi sadupyog karnaa chahie
 14
 Just as the grief of the wife's separation, the sorrow of the insult received from her siblings is unbearable, similarly the debt-ridden person remains unhappy at all times
 dusht raja kii seva main rahane vaala naukar bhi dukhi rahata he
 Man can never forget the curse of poverty
 inase vyakti kii aatma andar hi andar jalati rahati he
 15
 According to Chanakya, the life of the trees situated on the banks of the river is uncertain, because the rivers devastate the trees along the banks at the time of flood
 isi prakaar duusare ke gharon main rahane vaali stri bhi kisi samay patan ke maarg par ja sakati he
 Similarly, a king who does not have a minister to give good advice, he cannot remain safe for a long time
 isamen jaraa bhi andeh nahin karnaa chahie
 16
 Chanakya says that the way the prostitute turns away from the man at the end of the money
 usee tarah jab raja shaktiheen ho jaataa he to praja uskaa saath chhod detii he
 Similarly, birds living on trees also live on a tree as long as they get fruits from there
 atithi kaa jab puraa swaagat-satkar kar diya jaataa he to vah bhi us ghar ko chhod detaa he
 17
 The man who befriends a person with bad character, causing harm to others and living in an unclean place, is soon destroyed
 acharya chanakya kaa kahana he manushya ko kusangati se bachanaa chahie
 They say that it is in the good of man to leave the wicked person as soon as possible
 18
 chanakya kehete hai ki mitrataa, barabari vaale vyaktiyon main hi karnaa thik rahata he
 Government jobs are the best and for good business it is necessary to be efficient
 isi tarah sundar va susheel stri ghar main hi shobhaa detii he
 Learning of Chanakya, Chakanakya lived in a forest in a hut
 vahaan anek log unase paraamarsh or gyaan praapt karne ke liye aate the
 The forest in which he lived was full of stones and thorn bushes
 chunki us samay praaia: nange pair rahane kaa hi chalan tha, isliye unke nivas tak pahunchane main logon ko anek kashton kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 On reaching there, the feet of the people used to bled
 ek din kuch log us maarg se behad pareshaaniyon kaa saamana kar chanakya tak pahunche
 One person said while pleading with them, 'we were very sorry to reach you
 aap maharaj se kahkar yahaan kii jameen ko chamade se dhakwane kii vyavastha kara den
 This will make people comfortable
 ’ uski baat sunakar chanakya muskaraate hue bole, ‘mahashay, keval yaheen chamada bichaane se samasya hal nahin hogi
 The thorny and rocky paths are countless in this world
 aise main puure vishwa main chamada bichawana to asambhav he
 Yes, if you protect your feet with leather, then you can definitely avoid the wrath of stony paths and thorny bushes
 ’ vah vyakti sir jhukaakar bolaa, ‘haa guruji, main ab aisa hi karuunga
 ' iske baad chanakya bole, ‘dekho, meri is baat ke peeche bhi gaharaa saar he
 Instead of trying to improve others, improve yourself
 isse tum apane kaary main vijay avashya hasil kar loge
 The person who advises the world is unable to do anything, while his self-follower reaches the heights of success
 ’ is baat se sabhi sahamat ho gaye Chanakya's Amatiya Acharya Chanakya of Kutiyapatliputra was very scholarly fair and was also a straightforward honest gentleman
 ve itane bade samrajya ke mahaamantri hone ke baavjood chappar se dhaki kutiyaa main rahete the
 He had a living like a common man
 ek baar yunaan kaa rajdoot unase milane raaj darbar main pahunchaa raajnneeti or kutanay main daksh chanakya kii charchaa sunakar rajdoot mantrmugdh ho gaya
 The ambassador asked for an appointment with Chanakya in the evening
 acharya ne kaha-aap raat ko mere ghar aa sakate hai
 The Ambassador was pleased with Chanakya's behavior
 shaam ko jab vah rajmahal parisar main ’amatya nivas‘ ke bare main poochne laga
 Raj Prahari said - Acharya Chanakya lives outside the city
 rajdoot ne sochaa shaayad mahaamantri kaa nagar ke baahar sarovar par bana sundar mahal hoga
 The ambassador arrived outside the city
 ek naagarik se poocha ki chanakya kaha rahete hai
 Pointing towards a hut, the citizen said - See, she is the hut of the General Secretary
 rajdoot aashcharya chakit rah gaya
 After reaching the hut, he touched Chanakya's feet and complained - a shrewd general minister like you lives in a hut
 chanakya ne kaha-agar mai janata kii kadi mehnat or paseene kii kamai se bane mehalon se rahoonga to mere desh ke naagarik ko kutiyaa bhi naseeb nahin hogi
 The Greek ambassador bowed down on Chanakya's honesty

 Some ascetics had given birth to this institution
 isaki rachanaatmak bhoomika se jo log parichit hai ve aaj bhi iske prati vahi samarpit bhav rakhte hai
 We have no hesitation in making it acceptable that in the last few years due to some odd circumstances, its activism has come to an end
 kuch toh is vajah se bhi iske dher saare mukhya stambh tut gaye
 One by one, all institutions left us and ascended to heaven for ever

 adarsh kumaar pandeya -sidhi Autism is a disorder occurring during brain development that affects a person's social behavior and interaction
 hindi main ise 'aatmavimoh' or 'svaparayanata' bhi kehete hai
 The affected person behaves in a limited and repetitive manner, such as repeating the same task over and over
 yah sab bachche ke teen saal hone se pehle hi shuru ho jaataa he
 a set of these symptoms differentiates narcissism from mild narcotic spectrum disorder, such as Asperger's syndrome
 otism ek maansik rog he jiske lakshan janm se hi yaa baalyavastha se nazar aane lagaten hai
 The development of children who have this disease is unusual compared to other children
 otism hone ke koi ek kaaran nahin khoja ja sakaa he
 According to the recommendations, there can be many reasons for autism such as- aatmavimoh kaa ek majboot anuvanshik aadhaar hota he, haalanki aatmavimoh kii anuvanshiki jatil he or yah spasht nahin he ki ASD kaa kaaran bahujine samvaad he yaa durlabh utparivartan 
 In rare cases, narcissism has also been linked to factors that are responsible for birth defects
 anya prastaavit kaarnon me, bachapan ke tike, vivaadaaspad hai or iske koi vaigyanik saboot bhi nahin he
 According to a recent review, two cases per 1000 people are self-reported, while the number is close to 6 / 1000 for ASD
 ausatan ASD kaa purush:mahila anupaat 4,3:1 he
 Cases of narcissism have increased dramatically since 1980, one of the reasons being the growth in the field of medical diagnosis, but whether these cases have actually increased is an unanswered question
 aatmavimoh mastishk ke kai bhaagon ko prabhavit karata he, par iske kaarnon ko dhang se nahin samajha jaataa
 Parents usually recognize its symptoms in the first two years of their child's life
 shuruaati sangyanatmak yaa vyavhaari hastkshep, bacchon ko swayan kii dekhbhaal, saamaajik or baatcheet kaushal ke vikaas main sahaayta kar sakate hai
 There is no cure for it
 bahut kam aatistic bachche hi vayask hone par aatmanirbhar hone main safal ho pate hai
 Nowadays, a self-imposed culture has developed, in which some people believe in treatment and for some people self-immolation is a condition rather than a disorder
 aatmavimoh ko ek lakshan ke bajaay ek vishisht lakshanon ke samooh dwaara behatar samajha ja saktaa he
 Key symptoms include inability to social interaction, inability to communicate, limited hobbies, and repetitive behavior
 anya pahaluon me, jaise khaane kaa ajeeb tarika haalaanki aam he lekin nidaan ke liye aavashyak nahin he
 Social development In addition to being incapable of self-immolation, humans are unable to understand the intentions of other people, so people often do not take them seriously
 saamaajik asamarthataayen bachapan se shuru ho kar vyask hone tak chalati hai
 Autistic children tend to be indifferent to social activities, do not look at people, do not smile, and most commonly do not react: even when they are called
 otistic shishuon kaa vyavhaar to or chaunkaane vaala hota he, wo aankh nahin milaate hai or apni baat kehane ke liye wo aksar duusare vyakti kaa haath choote or hilaate hai
 Children between three and five years of age usually do not display social understanding, do not respond at all to calls, are insensitive to feelings, silent behaviorists and turn to others
 iske baavjood wo apni praathmik dekhbhaal karne vaale vyakti se jude hote he
 Children with narcissism exhibit less attuned protection than normal children, although this symptom disappears in children with high brain development or who have low ASD
 ASD se grasit bade bachche or vyask chehron or bhaawanaaon ko pahchaanane ke pareekshan main bahut bura pradarshan karte hai
 Contrary to popular belief, autistic children do not like to be alone
 dost bananaa or dosti banaae rakhana aatistic bachche ke liye aksar mushkil sabit hota he
 For them, the quality of friendship matters not the number of friends
 ASD se peedit logon ke gusse or hinsa ke bare main kaaphi kisse hai lekin vaigyanik adhyayan bahut kam hai
 These limited statistics show that only children with narcissism are aggressive or aggressive
 dominic at al, ne 67 ASD se grast bacchon ke mata-pita kaa saakshaatkaar liya or nishkarsh nikaala ki, do tihaai bacchon ke jivan main aanse daur aate hai jab unka vyavhaar bahut bura ho jaataa he jabaki ek tihaai bachche aakraamak ho jate hai, aksar bhashaa ko thik se na jaanane vaale bachche nakhrel hote hai
 There are some major differences between normal children and autistic children in childhood, on the basis of which this condition can be identified as- ek tihaai se lekar aadhe otistik vyaktiyon main apane dainik jivan kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke laayak bhashaa bodh tathaa bolne kii kshamta viksit nahin ho paati
 Shortcomings in communication are visible in the first year of life, including late speaking, unusual gestures, sluggish response, and a lack of cohesion in conversations with your foster
 duusare or tisare saal main, otistic bachche kam bolte hai, saath hi unka shabd sanchay or shabd sangyojan bhi vistrut nahin hota
 Their expressions often do not match their spoken words
 aatistic bacchon main anurodh karne yaa anubhavon ko baantne kii sambhaavna kam hoti he or unamem bas dusron kii baaten ko dohraane kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he 
 Functional communication requires joint attention, and this combined attention deficit distinguishes ASD infants from others: Example: Instead of the object they are pointing at, they might see the hand they are pointing to
 And they are failing to do so continuously
 otistic bacchon ko kalpanasheel khelon main or bhashaa seekhney main kathinaayee ho sakati he
 No particular repetition is related to narcissism, but narcissism is responsible for these behaviors
 otism ko sheeghra pahchaanana or manorog visheshgy se turant paraamarsh hi iskaa sabase pehla ilaaj he
 Contact a psychiatrist, psychologist, or trained special educator if symptoms of autism appear
 otism ek aaajeevan rahane vaali avasthaa he jiske purna upachaar ke liye koi dawa kii khoj zaari he, atah iske ilaaj ke liye yahan-vahaan na bhataken va bina samay gavaayen iske bare main jaankaree praapt karen
 Autism is a type of developmental disease that cannot be cured completely, but the patient can be taught a lot through proper training and counseling, which helps him to take care of himself in his daily life
 otism se grasit 70% vayaktiyon main maansik mandatha paayi jaati he jiske kaaran vah ek saamaanya jivan jeene main puri tarah se samarth nahin ho pate, parantu yadi maansik mandatha bahut aghik na ho to otism se grasit vyakti bahut kuch sikh paata he
 Sometimes some such abilities are also seen in these children which are far from the understanding and reach of normal people
 otism se grasit bachche ko nimnlikhit tareekon se madad di ja sakati he- If the child does one behavior again and again, to prevent it, engage him in some activities that keep him busy so that they do not repeat the behavior, minthi-vanag0i, paudi tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke paudi jile kaa ek gaanv he

 He offered them 1,000 lotus flowers and meditated on the 1,000 names of Lord Shiva with each offered flower
 unki jaanch ke liye bhagwaan shiv ne ek phool ko chipa diya
 When Lord Vishnu learned that a flower had fallen, he decided to offer one eye instead
 unki bhakthi se prasann hokar bhagwaan shiv ne unhen sudarshan chakra pradaan kar diya, jisase unhone asuron kaa vinaash kiya
 Since Lord Vishnu attained Sudarshan Chakra on the fourteenth day of Shukla Paksha in the month of Kartik, the festival of Baikuntha Chaturdashi is celebrated here with great pomp and show

Another idiomatic tribal tradition here is' Vanadevi 'worship - couples who do not have children, go to the forest alone after a small puja, and silently set fire to a forest tree and believe that this' Vandevi will be pleased with the fire and will fill her lap, but due to this superstition in Sitamata, trees have been growing on a large scale

 holi par 'dhundhotsav' manaaye jane kaa rivaaz he
 Like the whole of India, people do not play colors on 'dhulendi', it is customary to apply color on the day of 'rang-teres', which is 13 days after Holi
 'dashamata utsav' ke dauraan gaanvon main gaiyr nrity kiya jaataa he, 'bhaag-dashami teej' par baba ramdev kii sawari nikalati he or 'sheetala saptami' par jab gharon main aksar chulhaa nahin jalaayaa jaataa, makai se bane ek din puraane dhokle khaae jate hai

 The party won only 4 seats in the 2009 parliamentary election
 2014 ke sansadeey chunaav main dal ko maatr 1 siten mili There is some dispute over the date of establishment of CPI in the Communist movement
 khud bhakpa kaa maananaa he ki uskaa gathan 25 disambar 1925 ko kanpur main hui party congress main hua tha
 But the Communist Party of Marxist, which was formed after the partition of the party in 1964, believes that the party was formed in 1920
 makapa ke daawey ke anusaar bharat kii is sabase puraani communist party kaa gathan 17 oktober 1920 ko communist international kii duusari congress ke turant baad hua tha
 However, it can be said that since 1920 the process of formation of the party was going on and many groups also emerged in this regard
 lekin aupchaarik rup se 1925 main hi party kaa gathan hua
 Among its early leaders were Manvendra Nath Rai, Abani Mukherjee, Mohammad Ali and Shafiq Siddiqui

 Even before the CPI was formally formed, the British had filed a lawsuit against several active communists under the Kanpur Bolshevik conspiracy

 This made the communists famous and for the first time common people in India came to know about them
 20 march 1929 ko bhakpa se jude bahut se mahatvapurn netaaon ko meerut shadyantra cese main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 As a result, the party became leaderless
 1933 main pramukh netaaon ke meerut shadyantra cese se reeha hone ke baad party kaa punargathan kiya gaya
 Its Central Committee was formed and in 1934 it was accepted as the Indian part of Communist International
 1934 main congress ke bheetar vampanthi rujhaan rakhane vaale netaaon ne congress socialist party kaa gathan kiya
 At the time of its formation, the CPI leaders called it 'social fascism'
 lekin comintern dwaara upniveshon main bhartiya rashtriya congress jaise dalon ke prati drushtikon badalane se bhakpa ke congress ke prati drushtikon main bhi badlaav aayaa
 Now the CPI began to consider Congress politics as progressive
 iske sadasyon ne congress kii vampanthi dhara arthath siespi kii sadsyta grahan kii
 During 1936–1937, mutual cooperation between the Socialists and Communists increased considerably
 janvari 1936 main siespi kii duusari congress main yah thisis sweekaar kii gayi ki marxvad-leninavaad ke aadhaar par ek sanyukt bhartiya socialist party kii sthapana kii aavashyaktaa he
 Likewise, many communists were included in the National Executive Committee formed after the Third Congress of CSP
 baharhaal, yah nazadiiki lambe samay tak nahin chal paayi
 In the Ramgarh session of the Congress in 1940, the CPI released a document titled 'proletarian Path'
 isamen yudgh ke kaaran aupniveshik rajya kii kamazor haalat kaa hawala dete hue uske kilaaf sashastr andolan chhedane kii baat kii
 Enraged by this one-sided announcement of the CPI, the CSP expelled the Communist members from his party
 is bich, dwitiya vishwa-yudgh main soviet union or britain ke sambandhon ke achche hone ke kaaran july, 1942 main is par lagi pabandi hataa di gayi
 It started opposing Congress's anti-colonial strategy
 isane 1942 ke bharat chodo andolan kii aalochana kii or subhash chandra bose kii tikhi ninda kii
 An important achievement of the CPI in this period was also that it had established its supremacy over the All India Trade Union Congress, the trade organization of the Congress
 bhakpa ne 1946 main hue prantiy chunaavon main bhagidaari kii lekin ise puure desh ke 1585 prantiy vidhansabha kii siton main se kul aath siton par jeet mili
 Since its formation till the independence of the country, there have been many ups and downs in CPI politics
 isane ek samay congress or mahatma gandhi ko pratikriyaavaadi kii sangya di
 He also worked closely with them and separated from them again and opposed their politics
 yah virodh is seemaa tak pahunch gaya ki unhone bharat chodo andolan ke samay british shashan kaa samarthan kar daalaa
 One of the main reasons behind this was that Indian conditions were given less importance in CPI politics
 adhikansh maukon par communist international yaa soviet union ke nirdeshon ne party kii ranneeti tay karne kaa kaam kiya
 Due to this many times its strategies moved in the opposite direction
 in gadabadiyon ke baavjood congress ke mazdoor sanghathan or desh ke kuch bhaagon main isaki sthiti kaafii majboot ho gayi thi
 Communists also played an important role in the Tebhaga movement in Bengal and the Telangana movement in Andhra Pradesh
 1946 main hue tebhaaga andolan main bengal ke jotdaaron ne is baat ke liye sangharsh kiya ki unke paas apni kheti ke utpaada kaa do-tihaai bhaag hona chahie
 The Kisan Morcha Kisan Sabha of the CPI played an important role in this movement
 kuch jagahon par yah andolan hinsak bhi ho gaya
 The movement was successful and the Muslim League government of the state enacted a law that landlords would not be given more than one-third of the total produce
 lekin yah kanoon sahi tareeke se lagu nahin hua
 The Telangana movement took place in Hyderabad Rajwada
 yahan andhra mahasabha ke binar tale hyderabad ke nizaam ke kilaaf pehle hi andolan chal rahaa tha
 Communists had a significant presence in the Andhra General Assembly
 inhone kisaanon ko nizaam or sthaneey zameendaaron ke kilaaf jaagruk banaaya
 In Nalgonda, Warangal and Khammam districts, farmers launched agitations for loan waiver, abolition of bonded labor and redistribution of land
 yah andolan 1945 main shuru hua or 1946 aate-aate isane kaafii jor pakad liya
 The Nizam's armies and zamindars were brutally repressed
 hazaron kisaanon kii hatya kar di gayi
 But the armed squads of the farmers fiercely countered this repression
 in daston kaa bahut se gaanvon par niyantran ho gaya or unhone vahaan bhoomi sudhaar kii nitiyon par amal kiya
 By 1948, he had liberated about 16,000 square miles of land in 3,000 villages and distributed it among the people of the village
 sitambar, 1948 main bhartiya sena ke dabil se nizaam ke shashan kaa ant ho gaya
 Despite this the peasant revolt continued
 bhartiya sena ne bhi iskaa hinsak daman kiya
 Eventually, the movement was officially withdrawn by the CPI in 1951
 iske baad yah andolan dhimaa padate hue khatm ho gaya
 Tebhaga and Telangana movement have significant importance in the history of Indian Left
 isane jamini str par communiston ke prabhaav ko dikhaaya
 Currently all groups of communists claim the legacy of these movements
 bharat kii azaadi ke samay azaadi or bhartiya rajya kii prakruti ke bare main bhakpa main gahan or rochak vaad-vivaad hua

 But it did not get enough support within the party

 Therefore, the CPI can try to capture power through the armed struggle of the workers throughout the nation by combining democratic and socialist phases

 This was called the 'andhra line'
 1948 kii kalakatta congress main randive line kii jeet hui
 But on the other hand, by allowing the armed suppression of the Telangana movement in India by the Nehru government and on the other hand the success of the Chinese Revolution, the 'andhra line' position in the party became stronger

 After this, three documents were prepared

 Explaining the nature of Indian Burzwa, it was said that despite being primarily dependent on imperialist Burzwa, it has nationalist and non-cooperative elements
 iske baad madhyamargi netaa ajay ghosh ne party kii kaman sambhaali
 During this period the party recognized the independence of India and it was decided to participate in the elections, accepting the constitution
 pehle aam chunaavon main party kaa pradarshan bahut shandaar nahin mana ja saktaa, lekin loksabhaa main 16 siton par jeet hasil karke yah mukhya vipakshi dal ke rup main ubhari
 The CPI particularly focused on strengthening its position among the workers working in the organized sector
 iske mazdoor sanghathan ol india trade union congress kii mazaduron ke bich main acchhee paith thi
 But at that time it was difficult to challenge the dominance of Congress and Nehru in the politics of the country
 phir bhi bhakpa ne kuch rajyon main apni sthiti majboot kar lee
 The Congress again got a clear majority in the second general elections, but the CPI seats also increased
 in chunaavon main ise 27 loksabhaa kshetron main jeet mili

 The CPI government was formed under the leadership of Namboodiripad
 yah vishwa kii pehali chuni hui communist sarkaar thi
 But in 1959 the Nehru government dismissed it
 isse bhakpa ke ek dhade ke bheetar nehru ke prati kaafii naaraazgi paidaa ho gayi
 But the CPI activists were in a state of confusion at this time, because the Nehru government had a very good relationship with the Soviet Union
 soviet party kii yah apeksha thi ki bhakpa nehru sarkaar ke prati naram ravaiya apanaaye
 Meanwhile, such incidents took place at the international level due to which not only the international communist unity was affected, but the CPI was also divided
 saath kaa dashak aate-aate tak soviet union kii communist party or china kii communist party ke bich ke sambandh karaab hone lage
 The Communist Party of China accused the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of being a revisionist and had deviated from the path of marxism-leninism
 idhar china or bharat ke sambandh bhi kaafii karaab ho gayi
 The india-china war also took place in 1962 due to the border dispute
 bhakpa ke ek dhade ne bharat sarkaar kii niti kaa samarthan kiya
 At the same time another section of the party claimed that it is a confrontation between the socialist and the capitalist state
 asal main, bhakpa ke in dhadon kii ranneeti main antarrashtriya str par communiston ke bich chal rahi tanatani kii bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi
 The pro-soviet faction of the CPI took forward the idea of cooperating with the ruling National Party of India at that time
 lekin bhakpa ke ek duusare dhade, jo aage chalakar makapa bani, ne ise 'varg-sahyog' ke sanshodhanavaadee vichaar kii sangya di
 It is noteworthy that CPI won 29 seats in India's third general elections
 bhakpa ab bhi sansad main congress ke baad duusari sabase badi party thi
 But within a party's camp, the belief was reinforced that the CPI was not spreading due to lack of a strict attitude towards the Nehru government
 ek samay ke baad yah takaraav kaafii bad gaya
 The CPI split in 1964 and a new party CPI (M) emerged
 bhakpa ke kai jujharu netaa masalan namboodiripad, jyoti basu, harkishan singh surajeet aadi makapa main shaamil ho gayi
 This had a negative impact on the CPI basis in states like West Bengal
 kerala main party ke vibhaajan ke shuruaati kuch dashakon tak bhakpa kaa bhi acha-khaasaa prabhaav rahaa
 Between 1970-77, the CPI formed an alliance with the Congress and formed a government with it in which C
 Achutha Menon of the CPI became the Chief Minister of the state
 iske baad, kisi rajya main bhakpa ko satta main aane kaa mauka nahin mila
 The CPI supported Indira Gandhi's Emergency imposed by Congress due to alliance with Congress during 1970-77 period
 lekin assi kaa dashak aate-aate makapa zyaada majboot communist party ban gayi
 The CPI has a good presence in many other parts of the country, but the CPI (M) has gone ahead due to a stronger presence in some areas
 1977 ke baad bhakpa ne makapa or duusari choti communist partiyon ke saath milakar vam morche kaa gathan kiya
 In practically all places, including Kerala, this party turned into a smaller ally of the CPI (M)
 adhikansh maukon par iskaa pradarshan vam morche ke pradarshan par nirbhar rahaa
 In the later nineties, the CPI has given considerable attention to strengthening the politics of secular and non-bjp, non-congress parties
 makapa ke netritv vaale vam morche ke saath milakar isane congress kii nav-udaaravaadi nitiyon kaa virodh kiya
 No party got a majority after the 1996 Lok Sabha elections

 After this, HD a United Front government was formed under the leadership of Deve Gowda
 bhakpa ne ek aitihaasik faisalaa lete hue is sarkaar main shaamil hone kaa faisalaa kiya
 This decision was quite different from the decision of the CPI (M) which rejected the proposal to make Jyoti Basu the Prime Minister
 is tarah vam morche kaa bhaag hote hue bhi isane apni raajnneetik swytta pradarshit kii
 Its leaders joined the government of both the governments of the United Front and they held important ministries like Home Ministry and Agriculture Ministry

 It tried to ensure that this government works according to its minimum common program
 is dauraan bhakpa ne bhi sarkaar par kai janonmukhi kaarykram apnaane kaa dabaav banaaya
 Observers have generally believed that the Left Front pressure played an important role behind the very progressive and people-oriented laws enacted during the UPA-I government
 2008 main vam morche ne sanyukt rajya america se parmaanu samjhaute ke mudde par samprag sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya
 The performance of the Left Front in the 2009 general elections was much worse than in the 2004 general elections
 iskaa kaaran tha ki pashchim bengal main vam morche ke pradarshan main aayi giravat
 In particular, in places like Singur and Nandigram, incidents of forced land acquisition by the state government and repression by use of force against it have severed the image of the Left Front
 iskaa asar bhakpa ke chunavi pradarshan par bhi padaa or ise loksabhaa main 2004 kii 10 kii tulana main sirf 4 siton par hi jeet mili
 Many limitations of CPI politics are now clear: First, the CPI has integrated itself into the politics of the Left Front in such a way that even on many serious issues it has not opposed the CPI-M more than a limit
 sirf kuch maukon par hi isane apni swaittata dikhaai he, lekin adhikansh masalon par isaki ranneeti vam morche kii ranneeti kaa bhaag hoti he
 Second, although the CPI (M) is in a very strong position in the three states of the country, the expansion of the CPI has been more in other parts of the country
 masalan, bihar, chhattisgarh, or tamilnadu jaise rajyon main bhi bhakpa kii majboot upasthiti rahi he
 But in states like Bihar, it has lost its base to a large extent, as it has now failed to prove its relevance in front of identity politics
 teesraa, bhakpa duusare sansadeey vampanthi dalon kii tarah hi naye kshetron main apana vistaar karne main naakaam rahi he
 It has become a stalled party in a way
 yaa to yah kuch jagahon par apana aadhaar bachaane main safal rahi he, yaa us aadhaar ko bhi kho rahi he
 The CPI is not spreading in new areas
 1980 ke baad hue loksabhaa ke har chunaav main ise 15 se kam siton par hi jeet mili
 For example, in the 1980 parliamentary elections, 11 seats were won in 1984, 6 in 1989, 14 in 1991, 12 in 1996, 9 in 1998, 4 in 1999, 10 in 2004 and 4 seats in 2009
 chauthaa, yah bhi aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki bhakpa ne jamini str par sangharsh kii raajnneeti se munh mode liya he
 This criticism, however, cannot be taken as completely correct, because in areas where the CPI exists, it has fought a lot against state repression
 masalan, chhattisgarh ke dantewada jile main bhakpa ne rajya pryojit salwa judum abhiyaan kaa tikhaa pratirodh kiya
 Fifth, one of the grounds for criticism of CPI politics has been that it has fully accepted the democratic system of the capitalist state
 ab yah rashtravaadi ruparekha ke bheetar hi kaam kar rahi he or poonjeewaadi rajya ko ukhaad phenkane jaisi ranneeti isaki raajnneeti kaa bhaag nahin he
 However, despite these criticisms, it cannot be denied that the CPI has a long heritage in Indian politics
 bhartiya communist raajnneeti kii adhikansh dharaayen isi party se nikaleen
 It has also made serious efforts to establish solidarity between the left parties in parliamentary politics
 isaki koshish rahi he ki bharat main gair-congressi, gair-bhaajapaayi raajnneeti ko majbooti or aam logon ke hiton ko badhaava mili
 The CPI has been completely free from allegations of corruption at all levels
 asal main, bhakpa kii mukhya chunauti yah he ki yah vam morche kaa bhaag hote hue bhi makapa kii ‘photo copy’ yaa chota sahyogi hone se bache or apni swytt raajnneeti kaayam kare
 Apart from this, spreading itself to different parts of the country is also a big challenge for the CPI
