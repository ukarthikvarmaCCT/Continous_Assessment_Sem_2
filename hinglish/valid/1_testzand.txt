 The Basque Territory is an autonomous community located in the northeastern part of Spain
 swytt samudaay spain kaa sabase ucch-stareey prashasnic vibhaag hota he or lagbhag bharat ke rajyon ke baraabar hota he
 It is part of the traditional homeland of the Basque community of Spain and France
 isamen teen praant aate hai: alwa, biske or gipuzakoa
 The capital of the Basque region is vitoria-gasteis - 'vitoria' is the Spanish name of this city, while 'gasteis' is its name in Basque
 spani bhashaa main 'ba' or 'va' donon ko ek mishrit-dhwani se uccharit kiya jaataa he - dhyaan den ki na yah 'ba' he or na hi yah 'va' he balki in donon ke bich kaa ek uccharan he
 Therefore, many names are found in two forms
 masalan is swytt pradesh ke 'bask' or 'vask' donon hi naam thik hai
 The spelling of a language refers to the action of expressing words in that language with letters
 hindi main isaki aavashyaktaa kaaphi samay tak nahin samajhi jaati thi; jabaki anya kai bhashaaon, jaise angreji va urdu main iskaa mahatva tha
 In English and Urdu, spelling was repeated even half a century ago, which is still in practice today
 hindi bhashaa kaa pehla or bada gun dhvanyaatmakataa he
 It is very easy to express the sounds pronounced in Hindi
 jaisaa bolaa jaae, vaisaa hi likh jaae
 This was possible due to the versatile feature of Devanagari script and still is today
 parantu yah baat shat-pratishat ab thik nahin he
 There are many reasons for this - the effect of regional regional pronunciation, diversity, confusion, continuity of tradition, etc
 jab yah anubhav kiya jane laga ki ek hi shabd kii kai-kai vartanee milti hai to inako abhivyakt karne ke liye kisi sarthak shabd kii talash hui 
 For this reason the need for standardization was felt
 hindi shabdhsagar tathaa sankshipt hindi shabdhsagar ke praarambhik sanskarnon ke saath hi san 1950 main prakashit pramanik hindi kosh main iskaa prayog na hona yah sanket karata he ki is shatabdi ke madhya tak is shabd kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin samajhi gai
 In the sixth decade the spelling word got its place, a reference to which was found in the two books published then: pro
 shrivastav ke anusaar, hindi kii varnmaala purnatah dhvanyatmak hone ke kaaran hindi kii vartanee kii samasya utani gambhir nahin jitani angreji kii; kyonki hindi main aaj bhi likhit rup se shabd apane uccharit rup se adhik bhinn nahin
 He used the term Akshari, which could not come into vogue; Because at the same time the author fixed the use of syllable for syllabus in his doctoral treatise 'akshar' in Hindi language and 'limit of word'
 us samay tak bihar main ‘vivaran’ bengal main ‘banaan’ shabd hijje ssailing ke liye chal rahe the
 Apart from this, there were some other words in vogue - alphabet, syllable, description, character configuration, etc
 shiksha ke professor krishna gopal rastogi ne akshar vinyas shabd kaa prayog bahut samay tak kiya
 This is the character configuration
 amarkosh main lipi ke liye akshar vinyasah tathaa likhitam kaa prayog bhi paryaay ke rup main miltaa he
 Notwithstanding all the above words, 'spelling' has become valid in this sense and Central Hindi Directorate of Government of India, New Delhi has not only recognized this word, but has also established certain rules in terms of uniformity
 vartanee shabd bhi sanskrit bhashaa kaa he, jisaki vyutpattiyaan dete hue acharya nishantaketu ne ‘vartanee’ shabd ke koshgat arth bataae hai:- maarg, path, jeena, jivan or doosraa arth he: peesna, churna bananaa, takua
 The spelling was spelled first in the 'brihad Hindi Kosh' published by Gyanmandal, Varanasi
 kaaphi vivechan ke baad vartanee kii badi vyapak paribhaasha sthir kii gai: Even under the language empire, we can only call the spelling noun the syllable of letters or their disciplinary constitution in the limit of words
 xxrep 4 
 vartanee bhashaa kaa vartmaan he
 Spelling is the disciplined rotation of language, the rite of designation of spelling words
 vartanee ateet or bhavishya ke madhya kaa sethu sutara he
 This is the letter institute and alphabetical order
 acharya raghunatha prasad chaturvedi ne sanskrit vyakaran ke vaarthik se iskaa sambandh sthapit karte hue vyakt kiya
 There is a similarity between the phonetic and semantic meanings of both words and spelling
 sutara ke dwaara shabd sadhana kaa vaigyanik vishleshan hota he tathaa vaarthik main sutron dwaara trutipurna kathan par purna vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Spelling also undergoes this same parallel process
 vartanee kaa bhi samuhik vishuddh swaroop hi bhashaa kii samruddhi ke liye grahriy he
 Despite being opposed to the spelling word, Acharya Vajpayee's contribution to the upliftment of this word and Hindi spelling and word analysis are remarkable
 maanak hindi vartanee kaa kaaryakshetra kendriya hindi nideshaalay kaa he
 Many veterans have made their contribution in this direction, out of which the names of Acharya Kishori Dass Vajpayee and Acharya Ramchandra Varma are notable
 hindi bhashaa ke sangh or kuch rajyon kii rajbhasha sweekrut ho jane ke falswaroop desh ke bheetar or baahar hindi seekhney waalon kii sankhya main paryaapt vruddhi ho jane se hindi vartanee kii maanak paddati nirdhaarit karnaa aavashyak or kalochit laga, taaki hindi shabdon kii vartaneeyon main adhikadhik ekarupata laai ja sake
 Accordingly, the Ministry of Education, Government of India appointed an Expert Committee in 1961 to determine the standard method of Hindi spelling
 is samiti ne april 1962 main antim report di
 The committee had four meetings in which after serious deliberation a rule regarding spelling was laid down
 samiti ne tadnusaar, 1962 main apni antim siforishein prastut kin jo sarkaar dwaara anumodith kii gayi or antat hindi bhashaa ke maanakeekaran kii sarkari prakriya kaa shriganesh hua
 This process is continuous, but the main instructions have been decided

 Khandakavya is a form of management poetry in literature
 jivan kii kisi ghatana vishesh ko lekar likhaa gaya kavy khandakavy he
 It is clear from the word "khand Kavya" that only one event of human life prevails in it
 jisamen charit nayak kaa jivan sampoorn rup main kavi ko prabhavit nahin karata
 Poet Charitra, being influenced by some outstanding event in the life of the hero, inaugurates that particular section of life in his poetry
 prabandhaatmakataa mahakavy evam khand kavy donon main hi rahati he parantu khand kavy ke kathasutra main jivan kii anekarupatha nahin hoti
 Hence its plotline quickly ends to end like the story

 There is only one major story in Khandakavya, the relevant stories are not found in it

 vah mahakavy ke keval ek ansh kaa hi anusaran karata he
 Accordingly, some of the Acharya Khandakavya of Hindi consider such poetry which has been composed in the manner of epic, but only the particular section of it has been taken without taking the whole life in it
 arthath khandakavy main ek khand jivan is prakaar vyakt kiya jaataa he jisase vah prastut rachana ke rup main swat: prathit ho
 In fact, Khandakavya is a poetic poem whose plot has unitary discovery; The story should have a monologue and the narrative sequence should begin with development, culminate in the climax and definite purpose and be small in size

 It is a famous poetic genre of Arabic literature which later became extremely popular in Persian, Urdu, Nepali and Hindi literature as well

 ghazal ek hi bahar or vazan ke anusaar likhe gaye sheron kaa samooh he
 Before this, the lion is called nausea

 The poet usually keeps his name in Makte

 a ghazal can have between 5 and 25 lions
 ye sher ek duusare se swatantra hote hai
 Sometimes more than one lion gives meaning
 aise sher kata band kehalaate hai
 The words rhymed in the lion of Ghazal are called kafia and the words repeated in the lions are called radif
 sher kii pankti ko misra kaha jaataa he
 Kafia occurs in both Egyptians of Malta and the latter line of Kafias in the second line of lions
 radif hameshaa kaafiye ke baad aata he
 Radif and Kafia can also be parts of the same word and can also be a lion without Radif that ends on the Kafiyya
 ghazal ke sabase achche sher ko shahe bait kaha jaataa he
 Such a collection of ghazals is called Diwan in which there should be at least one ghazal for every week
 urdu kaa pehla dewan shaayar kuli qutubashah he
 Ghazals are of two types based on rhyme - bhav ke aadhaar par bhi gazalen do prakaar kii hoti hai- Ghazals began as a poetic genre of Arabic literature
 arabi bhashaa main kahi gayi gazalen vastav main naam ke hi anuroop thi arthath usamen auraton se baaten yaa uske bare main baaten hoti thi
 After coming from Arabic to Persian literature, this genre remained unchanged at the level of craftsmanship, but in terms of the narrative, they overtook them
 unamem baat to daihik yaa bhautik prem kii hi kii gai kintu uske arth vistaar dwaara daihik prem ko aadhyatmik prem main badal diya gaya
 Arabic love became popular in Persian
 farsi ghazal main premi ko sadik or premika ko mabood kaa darja mil gaya
 Sufi seekers played a decisive role in giving Ghazal its form
 sufi sadhana virah pradhan sadhana he
 Therefore, in the Persian ghazals, the separation aspect took precedence rather than coincidence
 farsi se urdu main aane par bhi ghazal kaa shilpagat rup jyon kaa tyon sweekaar kar liya gaya lekin kathy bhartiya ho gaya
 But contrary to the common concept of North India, Indian ghazals originated in the Deccan during the Bahmani Sultanate where ghazals influenced by songs were written
 bhashaa kaa naam rekhta padaa
 Vali Dakani, Siraj Daud etc
 were the poets of this tradition who in a way carried forward the tradition of Amir Khusro
 dakkini urdu ke gazalakaaron ne arabi farsi ke badale bhartiya pratikon, kavy roodhiyon, evam saanskrithik prishthbhumi ko lekar rachana kii
 At that time, the language of royalty in North India was Persian, so when Ghazal came to North India, Persian influence on it started increasing
 gaalib jaise urdu ke shreshth gazalkaar bhi farsi gazalon ko hi mahatvapurn maanate rahe or urdu gajal ko farsi ke anuroop banane kii koshish karte rahe
 Later, during the Dawood era, the influence of Persian was somewhat reduced
 ikbaal kii aarambhik gazalen isi prakaar kii he
 Later, due to political conditions, the influence of Persian on the Urdu ghazals started increasing again
 1947 ke baad isamen punah kami aane lagi
 Many Hindi writers adopted this mode

 is mat ke upaask lingayat kehalaate hai
 The word is derived from the Kannada word lingwant
 ye log mukhyatah mahatma basavanna kii shikshaaon ke anugami hai
 The literal meaning of 'veerashaiva' is - 'one who is a supreme devotee of Shiva'
 kintu samay bitne ke saath virshaiv kaa tatvagyan darshan, sadhana, karmkand, saamaajik sanghatan, acharnium aadi anya sampradaayon se bhinn hote gaye
 Although Veerashaiva is also found in other parts of the country - Maharashtra, Andhra, Tamil region, etc
, Karnataka has the largest number of them
 shaiva log apane dharmik vishwaason or darshan kaa udgam vedon tathaa 28 shaivagamon se maanate hai
 Veerashaiva also does not show disbelief in the Vedas but in his philosophy, rituals and social reforms, such specialties have developed which are mainly derived from Shaivagams and such insight yogis who are known as 'vaadikars'
 12veen se 16 veen shatee ke bich lagbhag teen shatabdiyon main koi 300 vachanakaar hue hai jinamein se 30 striyaan rahi hai
 The most famous of these is Basava, who was the Prime Minister of the Jain king of Kalyan, Vizjal
 vah yogi mahatma hi na tha balki karmath sanghatankarta bhi tha jisane virshaiv sampradaay kii sthapana kii
 The goal of Vasava was to create a spiritual society in which caste, religion or women were not discriminated against
 vah karmkand sambandhi aadambar kaa virdohi tha or maansik pavitrataa evam bhakthi kii sachaai par bal detaa tha
 He was a supporter of the worship of only one God and tried to simplify the method of worship and meditation

 Veerashaiva is sometimes called 'sharan' or Shiva Sharan of Mahatmas, ie people who have given themselves to Shiva's refuge
 unki sadhana shivayog kehalaati he
 Veerashaivism is basically monotheistic philosophy but is essentially beyond divine action and meditation and the existence of the world in our real experience cannot be explained without desire and action, hence Shiva's theory of power was conceived
 ishwar se ekta sthapit karne ke liye aadhyatmik aakankshi apni ek yaa teenon shaktiyon kaa prayog karata he
 The name of the use of love power is bhakti yoga, the knowledge of the use of thinking power and the name of the use of karma power is karma yoga

 There is no doubt that the Veerashaivas also have temples, shrines, etc
 as in other sects, the difference being only between the deities who are worshiped

 Needless to say that every Veerashaiva is expected to possess high moral qualities like truthfulness, non-violence, fraternity
 vah niraamish bhoji hota he or sharaab aadi maadak vastuon se parhez karata he
 The summary of the directions issued by Basava in this regard is this - Do not steal, do not kill nor lie, do not praise or condemn others, treat all women other than your wife as mother

 Aristotle propounded by the theory of arbitration that through art and literature our corrupted minds are properly devalued
 safal traasadee virechan dwaara karunaa or traas ke bhaavon ko udbud karti he, unka saamanjan karti he or is prakaar anand kii bhoomika prastut karti he
 Decontamination does not only cause emotional relaxation, it also has emotional refinement
 is tarah arastu ne kala or kavy ko prashansaneey, grahya or sayas rakshneey siddh kiya he
 Aristotle made a successful attempt to restore the importance of art and poetry through this principle
 arastu ke guru plato ne kaviyon or kalakaaron ko apane adarsh rajya ke baahar rakhane kii sifarish kii thi
 He believed that poetry is helpful in nurturing and inciting our lusts and is therefore condemnable and discordant
 dharmik or ucch koti kaa naitik sahitya iskaa apwaad he kintu adhikansh sahitya is adarsh shrenee main nahin aata he
 The importance of the theory of arbitration is multiple
 pratham to yah he ki usne plato dwaara kavy par lagaae gaye akshep kaa niraakaran kiya or doosraa yah ki usne gat kitne hi varshon ke kavyashastreey chintan ko kisi-na-kisi rup main avashya hi prabhavit kiya
 'virechan' is the Hindi version of Greek Katharsis
 unani chikitsashastra kaa paribhaashik shabd he- ‘catharsis’ or bhartiya chikitsashastra kaa paribhaashik shabd he- ‘virechan’
 Its meaning is the purification of physical disorders i
e
 abdominal disorders by interesting medicine
 swasthya ke liye jis prakaar shaareerik mel kaa nishkasana-shodhan aavashyak he, usee prakaar irshyaa, dwesh, lobh, moh or krodh aadi maansik malon kaa nishkasana evam shodhan aavashyak he
 Aristotle uses the term 'catharsis' to symbolically inaugurate the impact of the tragedy on the human mind
 traasadee ke prati plato kii aapatti thi- ‘‘vah maanav kii vaasanaon kaa daman karne ke sthaan par unka poshan or sinchan karti he
 It creates chaos in the soul by raising the lower elements instead of the higher elements
 ’’ Aristotle refuted this invasion of Plato by the catharsis theory and established the utility of tragedy
 plato ne jise dosha siddh kiya tha, arestu ne usee ko gun ke rup main prastut kiya
 Aristotle's opinion is- arthath traasadee kisi gambheer swatah purna tathaa nishchit aayam se yukt kaary ko anukriti kaa naam he
 


 Whose mentality is properly discussed by the apostle from the compassion tragedy
 isi prakaar traasadee keval avaanchhneeya bhaawanaaon ko hi uddipt nahin karti, apitu karunaa or traas ke kritrim udrek dwaara maanav ke vaastavik jivan kii karunaa or traas kii bhaawanaaon kaa nishkasana karti he
 Virechan is mentioned only in two places in Aristotle's compositions
 pratham ullekh uske ‘poytics’ granth main, jahaan tragedy ke swaroop kii ore sanket kiya gaya he or doosraa ‘raajnneetik’ naamak granth main jahaan unhone sangeet kii upyogita pratipaadit kii he
 At these places, he has discussed the form of the word Virechan and its form
 arestu kaa kathan he- ‘‘sangeet kaa adhyayan ek nahin varan anek uddeshyon kii siddhi ke liye hona chahie, arthath shiksha ke liye virechan ke liye
 Music also brings intellectual joy
 xxrep 5 
 dharmik raagon ke prabhaav se ve shant ho jate hai, maanon unke aavesh kaa shaman or virechan ho gaya ho
 Thus purgation means purification
 arestu ke ye vichaar traasadee-vivechan ke sandarbh main footkar rup main milte hai
 They have not been edited in a particular orderly fashion
 aadhunik yug main arestu ke simit or alp shabdon ne purna kavy-shastreey siddhanth kaa rup dhaaran kar liya he
 So a question naturally arose that what did Aristotle originally mean by the motives and catharsis of compassion and tragedy? In this context, the later interpreters of Aristotle presented different meanings and interpretations of the interpretation
 arestu ke vyakhyakaaron main pro gilbert mare or livi ne virechan kii dharmaparak vyakhya prastut kii he
 Religious meaning has a particular background
 iskaa sambandh dharmik utsavon se he
 Prof
 Gilbert Murray states that - "the celebration in Greece of a deity named Deonusus was a symbol of purification in itself, in which the emancipation of the past and liberation from sin and death-consoles
 is prakaar bahya vikaron dwaara aantarik vikaron kii shanti kaa yah upaay arestu ke samay main dharmik sansthaaon main kaaphi prachlit tha
 They have used it figuratively on the basis of this and purgation means "spiritual purification and peace through external stimulation and ultimately its mitigation
" ’’ a German scholar named Barnez gave a strategic interpretation of Virechan
 uske anusaar maanav-man anek manovikaron se akraant rahata he
 Karun and fear are basically sadistic emotions
 traasadee rangamanch par avastavik paristhitiyon dwaara inhen atiranjit rup main prastutkar kritrim aspasht upayon se prekshak ke man main vaasana rup main sthit in manovegon ke desh kaa niraakaran or uske parinamswaroop maansik saamanjasy kii sthapana karti he
 Therefore, purgation has a strategic meaning - mitigation of excitement after stimulation of psychologists and mental mental vividness
 vartmaan manovigyaan tathaa manovishleshan shaastra bhi is arth kii pushti karte hai
 Being a practitioner of mental health, this method is considered ethical
 gete or angreji ke svachhndatavaadi kavi aalochakon main virechan ke kalaparak arth ke sanket milte hai
 Aristotle's famous interpreter Prof
 Butcher is of the opinion that ecclesiology is not merely a sign of a particular fact of psychology or diagnostics, but an expression of an art-theory
 is prakaar traasadee kaa karttavya-karm keval karunaa yaa traas ke liye abhivyakti kaa madhyam prastut karnaa hi nahin apitu inhen ek sunishchit kalatmak parithosh pradaan karnaa he
 They have to be refined and clarified in the medium of art
 virechan kaa arth yahan vyapak he- maansik santulan iskaa purv bhaag maatr he, parinti uski kalatmak parithosh kaa parishkar hi he jiske bina traasadee ke kalaagat aswaad kaa vrutt puraa nahin hota
 The question arises that which of the above three meanings is closest to Aristotle's view? Although Aristotle is naturally influenced by the then religious conditions and Aristotle himself has indicated towards religious music that just as religious music stimulates the audience's emotions and restores, so does the fear of the tragedy observer and the feelings of compassion Wakes up and subjugates them later
 traasadee ke sambandh main yah mat aksharshah thik nahin he, kyonki sangeet dwaara thik kiye janevaale vyakti pehle hi bhavakrant hote the, jabaki prekshagrih main janevaale vyakti karunaa yaa bhay kii maansik sthiti main nahin hote
 Therefore, the effect of the said practice on the concept of the doctrine can be considered indirect; But it is necessary to establish a direct relationship
 jahaan tak nitiparak arth kii baat he, manovigyaan bhi isaki pushti karata he
 Aristotle's means of expulsion not only expel expressions, but also their balance
 isi prakaar pro bujar kaa arth bhi vichaarneey he
 According to him, arbitration has two sides - one is emotional and the other is emotional
 abhavatmak paksh yah he ki vah pehle manovegon ko uttejit karen, taduparant unka shamankar manakshanti pradaan kare
 After this, artistic fulfillment is his emotional side
 virechan ko bhavatmak rup dena uchit nahin he
 Aristotle's intention is only up to the harmony of mind and taciturnism, on the basis of which the current critic Richards has given the theory of 'a set of inertia'
 dow nagendra kaa mat he ki ‘‘virechan kala-swaad kaa sadhak to avashya he- samanjit man kala ke anand ko adhik tatparta se grahan karata he, parantu virechan main kala-swaad kaa sahaj antarbhaav nahin he
 Therefore, it is perhaps not justified to give effect to the theory of purgation
 ’’ According to modern scholars, feelings of tragedy and compassion are manifested in their natural form by becoming more annoying
 traasadee ke prekshna ke falswaroop ve apane anugr evam anaapattijanak rup ko prakashit karti he
 In this form, they emerge as personal and universal
 isse virechan or saadhaaraneekaran kaa ghanishtha sambandh sahaj hi dekha ja saktaa he
 Here the question arises that is the devolution theory the only expedient medium to understand the impact or purpose of the tragedy? Indeed, restricting the act of tragedy to catharsis is like narrowing its purpose
 iske vipareet bhavvaadi samikshakon ne virechan kaa kshetra atyant vistrut banaakar yah siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya he ki virechan se avaanchhneeya bhaawanaaon main bhi parivartan hota he or unka atirek mitata he
 Scholars such as Dryden, Edison, etc
 gave this comprehensive view
 kuch vidwaan virechan prakriya ke astitv ke bare main shankaa karte hai
 They object that such arbitration does not happen in real life
 traasadee se karunaadi manoveg udbuddha to ho jate hai, kintu unke virechan se manah shaanti sarvatha nahin hoti
 In fact, the miracle of tragedy is basically emotional
 vah virechan-prakriya dwaara bhaavon ko udbuddha karti he unka samanjan karti he or is prakaar anand kii bhoomika prastut karti he
 This is an important contribution of the theory of purgation
 doosraa akshep yah he ki traasadee main pradarshit bhaag avastavik hote hai, atah ve hamaare bhaavon ko udbuddha nahin kar pate, virechan kii to baat hi nahin
 Actually, this opinion is also not appropriate
 traasadee dwaara bhavodwek nishchay hi kala-chamatkaar kaa pratifal nahin, ragaatmak prabhaav kii parinti he
 a significant complementary effect is the reason for its success
 atah akshep sarvatha nirmul he
 According to psychoanalytic science, the inattention or suppression of emotions is the leading cause of mental illnesses
 inkaa vichaar bhaavon kii uchit abhivyakti or parithosh dwaara ho saktaa he
 Expressions in the unconscious mind give rise to mental glands due to lack of proper expression
 in grathiyon ko chetan str par laakar man kii ghutan or atrupti ko dur kiya jaataa he
 This relieves the tension of the mind and the mind experiences a kind of vividness and lightness
 manovishleshan shaastra kii unmukt vichaar-pravaah-pranali kaa aadhaar yahi prakriya he
 From this point of view, the psychological basis of purgation is absolutely strong
 frid aadi vidwaanon ne anek sthalon par arestu vaakyon ko apan mat ke samarthan main prastut kiya he
 The impact of the tragedy propounded by Aristotle has a substantial resemblance to Karun Ras in Indian poetry
 traasad prabhaav ke aadharbhoot manoveg he- karunaa or traas
 Both these expressions are basically sad
 udhar karun ras kaa sthaayee bhav ‘shok’ he
 Indian poetics 'mourning' accepts the existence of tragedy with compassion under the permanent sense
 isht naash yaa vipatti shok ke kaaran hai
 They evoke both compassion and tragedy
 vipatti ke saakshaatkaar se karunaa kii, waisi hi vipatti kii punrariti kii ashanka se traas kii anubhuti hoti he
 But the major difference between the views of Indian Acharyas and Aristotle is that the tragic effect of Aristotle is a mixed emotion, while the mourning lasting feeling of Indian poetry is fundamentally immortal, as in the compassion produced by Sita's misfortune, there is no touch of tragedy, whereas Aristotle In the eyes of the tragic Karun incident is not an ideal situation

 This is the philosophy of Premchand
