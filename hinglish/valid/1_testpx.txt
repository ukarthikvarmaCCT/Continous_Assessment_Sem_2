puraanon main vaidic kaal se chale aate hue sristi aadi sambandhi vichaaron, pracheen raajaaon or rishiyon ke paramparaagat vrittanton tathaa kahaniyon aadi ke sangrah ke saath saath kalpit kathaon kii vichitrataa or rochak varnanon dwaara sampradayik yaa saadhaaran upadesh bhi milte hai
 The Puranas are not proof texts like Shruti, Smriti etc
 puraanon main vishnu, vaayu, matsay or bhagwat main aitihaasik vrutt— raajaaon kii vanshavali aadi ke rup main bahut kuch milte hai
 Although these genealogies are very brief and there are some contradictions among them, but they are of great use
 puraanon kii ore aitihaasikon ne idhar vishesh rup se dhyaan diya he or ve in vanshawaliyon kii chaanbin main lage hai
 'purana' literally means 'ancient legend' or 'old story'
 ‘pura’ shabd kaa arth he - anaagat evam ateet
 The word 'ana' means - say or tell
 raghuvansh main puraana shabd kaa arth he "puraana patrapag magannataram" evam vaidic vaanmay main "pracheen: vrittant:" diya gaya he
 From the cultural meaning, those specific scriptures of Hindu culture, which have been described in words from the creation to the Holocaust, are called Puranas
 puraana shabd kaa ullekh vaidic yug ke veda sahit aditam sahitya main bhi paaya jaataa he at: ye sabase puraatan maane ja sakate hai
 According to the Atharvaveda "ritch: Samani Chhandansi Purana Yajusha Sah 11
7
2") meaning the Puranas originated with Rik, Sama, Yajusud o Chand
 shatapath brahman main to puranavagamay ko veda hi kaha gaya he
 The Chandogya Upanishad has also called Purana the Veda
 brihadaaranyakopanishad tathaa mahabharat main kaha gaya he ki "itihaas puranabhyaan vedarth mupbarhayet" arthath veda kaa arthvistaar puraana ke dwaara karnaa chaiye
 It is clear from them that Puran and history have been kept on the same level in the Vedic period
 amarkosh aadi pracheen koshon main puraana ke paanch lakshan maane gayi hai : sarg, pratisarg, vansh, manvantar, or vanshanucharit 
 It is believed that Brahma, the creator of the universe, who first composed the oldest scripture, is known as Purana
 prachinkaal se puraana devataaon, rishiyon, manushyon - sabhi kaa maargdarshan karte rahe hai
 The Puranas teach man to lead a life according to religion and policy
 puraana manushya ke karmon kaa vishleshan kar unhen dushkarm karne se rokte hai
 The Puranas are virtually an extension of the Vedas
 veda bahut hi jatil tathaa shushk bhashaa-style main likhe gaye hai
 Ved Vyas ji composed and reconstructed the Puranas
 kaha jaataa he, ‘‘purna puraana ’’ jiskaa arth he, jo vedon kaa poorak ho, arthath puraana 
 The sayings in the complex language of the Vedas are explained in simple language in the Puranas
 puraana-sahitya main avatharavaad ko pratishthit kiya gaya he
 Believing the power of the formless formless, worshiping the virtuous form is the subject of these texts
 puraanon main alag-alag devi-devataaon ko kendra main rakhkar paap-punya, dharm-adharm or karm-akarm kii kahaniyaan hai
 Love, devotion, sacrifice, service, tolerance are human qualities in the absence of which an advanced society cannot be imagined
 puraanon main devi-devataaon ke anek swaroopon ko lekar ek vistrut vivaran miltaa he
 Puranas have detailed depiction of misdeeds in revealing truth
 puranakaron ne devataaon kii dushpravritiyon kaa vyapak vivaran kiya he lekin mul uddeshy sadbhaavna kaa vikaas or satya kii pratishtha hi he
 Vanshabali of kings is found only in 5 Matsya, Vayu, Vishnu, Brahmin and Bhagavata Puranas
 puraana atharah hai
 M-2, B-2, Br-3, V-4
 a-1,naa-1, pa-1, lin-1, ga-1, ku-1, sk-1 
vishnu puraana ke anusaar unke naam ye hai—vishnu, padam, brahm, vaayu, bhagwat, naarad, markendeya, agni, brahmavaivart, ling, varah, skanda, vaaman, kurm, matsay, garuda, brahmad or bhavishya
 a peculiarity in the Puranas is that each Purana has names and their number of Atharho Puranas
 naam or shlokasankhya praayah sabaki milti he, kahin kahin bhed he
 Such as Vayu Purana in place of Agni in the Koram Purana; Narsinghpurana in place of Lingapurana in Markandeya Purana; There is Narada Purana in place of Shiva Purana in Devi Bhagwat and Vayu Purana in Matsya
 bhagwat ke naam se aajkal do puraana milte hai—ek shrimadbhagwat, doosraa devibhagwat
 Who is really Purana, there is a fight over it
 ramashram swami ne 'durjanmukhachapetica' main siddh kiya he ki shrimadbhagwat hi puraana he
 On this, Kashinath Bhatt wrote 'durjanmukhahachapetika' and another Pandit wrote 'durjanmukhapadyapaduka' in favor of Devi Bhagwat
 sukhsagar ke anusaara The oldest of the Puranas appears to be Vishnupurana
 usamen sampradayik khinchataan or ragadwesh nahin he
 The five characteristics of the Purana also fall on it
 usamen sristi kii utpatti or lay, manwantaron, bhartadi khandon or suryaadi lokon, vedon kii shakhaon tathaa vedavyas dwaara unke vibhaag, surya vansh, chandra vansh aadi kaa varnan he
 Among the kings of Kali, even the Maurya kings of Magadha and the kings of the Gupta dynasty are mentioned
 shrikrishna kii lilaon kaa bhi varnan he par bilkul us rup main nahin jis rup main bhagwat main he
 Some people say that Vayu Purana is the Shiv Purana because the present day Purana or Upapurana called Shiv Purana has no verse number of 24,000, only 7,000
 vayupurana ke chaar paad he jinamein sristi kii utpatti, kalpon ore manwantaron, vaidic rishiyon kii gaathaon, daksh prajapati kii kanyaon se bhinn bhinn jeevotpati, suryavanshi or chandravanshi raajaaon kii vanshavali tathaa kali ke raajaaon kaa praayah vishnupurana ke anusaar varnan he
 In addition to manvantars and dynasties in the Matsyapuran, Varnashrama Dharma is described in great detail and the whole story of Matsyavatar
 isamen may aadi asuron ke sanhaar, maatrulok, pitrulok, murti or mandir banane kii vidhi kaa varnan vishesh dhang kaa he
 The preaching of Shrimad Bhagwat is the most because it contains a detailed description of the greatness of devotion and the pastimes of Shri Krishna
 nau skandhon ke bheetar to jeevabrahm kii ekta, bhakthi kaa mahatv, sristilila, kapildev kaa janm or apni mata ke prati vaishnav bhavanusaar sankhyashastra kaa upadesh, manwantar or rishivanshavali, avatar jisamen rishabhdev kaa bhi prasang he, dhruv, venu, pruthu, prahlaad ityadi kii katha, samudramathan aadi anek vishay hai
 But the biggest tenth is the wing in which Krishna's Leela is described in detail
 isi skandh ke aadhaar par shringaar or bhakthiras se purna krishnacharit sambandhi sanskrit or bhashaa ke anek granth bane hai
 The Ekadash wing describes the destruction of the Yadavas and the twelfth kingship of the Rāchas of Kali Yuga
 bhagwat kii lekhanstyli anya puraanon se bhinn he
 Its language is erudite and full of literary wonders, due to which its creation is considered to be somewhat behind
 agnipurana ek vilakshan puraana he jisamen rajvanshawaliyon tathaa sankshipt kathaon ke atirikt dharamshastra, raajnneeti, rajdharm, prajadharm, ayurveda, vyakaran, ras, alankaar, shastr-vidya aadi anek vishay hai
 There is also a detailed case of Tantradiksha
 kali ke raajaaon kii vanshavali vikram tak ai he, avatar prasang bhi he
 There are similar stories in other Puranas
 vishnupurana ke atirikt or puraana jo aajkal milte hai unke vishay main andeh hota he ki ve asal puraanon ke na milane par peeche se na banaae gaye hon
 Many of the Puranas are filled with differences of opinion and cults
 koi kisi devtaa kii pradhanta sthapit karata he, koi kisi devtaa kii pradhanta sthapit karata he, koi kisi kii
 According to the introduction of Brahmavaivarta Purana, which is given in Matsyapurana, it should contain the story of Rathantar Kalpa and Varaha Avatar, but the Brahmavaivarta which is found today is not in this story
 krishna ke vrundavan ke raas se jin bhakton kii tripti nahin hui thi unke liye golok main sadaa honevaale raas kaa usamen varnan he
 This Brahmavaivart of today is several hundred years behind the arrival of the Muslims because it also mentions the origin of the 'julaha' caste - Mlechhat Kuvindakanya Jola Jatirbhabhav
 brahmpurana main tirthon or unke mahatmaya kaa varnan bahut adhik hai, anant vasudev or purushottam mahatmaya tathaa or bahut se aise tirthon ke mahatmaya likhe gaye hai jo pracheen nahin kahe ja sakate
 'purushottam Prasad' is definitely a reference to the huge temple of Jagannath ji, which was built by King Chodaganga of the Ganga dynasty
 matsaypurana main die hue lakshan aajkal ke padmapurana main bhi puure nahin milte hai
 There are many things in this about the hostility of Vaishnava communalists
 jaise, pashadilakshan, mayavadaninda, taamsashastra, puranavarnanaityadi
 Vaiseshika, Nyaya, Samkhya and Charvak have been called 'tamas Shastra' and it has also been told that the Buddha-form Vishnu called Asat Buddhist scripture for the destruction of the demons
 isi prakaar matsay, kurm, ling, shiv, skanda or agni taamas puraana kahe gaye hai
 The essence is that the present form of most Puranas is within a thousand years
 sabake sab puraana sampradayik he, isamen bhi koi andeh nahin he
 Many Puranas meet a lot in their ancient form, but in them also communalists have increased many things
 yadhyapi aajkal jo puraana milte hai unamem se adhiktar peeche se bane hue yaa prakshipt vishyon se bhare hue hai tathaapi puraana bahut pracheen kaal se prachlit the
 It is written in the Brihadaranyaka and Shatapatha Brahmana that smoke emanates from the wet wood in the same way as the expulsion of the great ghosts led to the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, Atharvangiras, history, mythology, Upanishads, shlokas, sutras, lectures and lectures
 chhandogya upanishad main bhi likhaa he ki itihaas puraana vedon main paanchavaan veda he
 Puranas were also prevalent with the Vedas in the very ancient times, which were said on the occasion of Yajna etc
 kai baaten jo puraana ke lakshanon main hai, vedon main bhi hai
 Like, before there was nothing else, it was canto or creation; Devasur Sangram, Urvashi Pururava dialogue is history
 mahabharat ke aadi parv main bhi anek raajaaon ke naam or kuch vishay ginaakar kaha gaya he ki inke vrittant vidwaan satkaviyon dwaara puraana main kahe gaye hai
 It can be said that there were Puranas even during the creation of Mahabharata
 manusmriti main bhi likhaa he ki pitrikaaryon main veda, dharamshastra, itihaas, puraana aadi sunaane chahie
 Now the question is, who made the Puranas
 shivpurana ke antargat reva mahatmaya main likhaa he ki atharahon puraanon ke vaktaa matyavatisut vyas hai
 The same thing is prevalent in common people
 par matsaypurana main spasht likhaa he ki pehle puraana ek hi tha, usee se 18 puraana hue 
 It is written in the Brahmanda Purana that Ved Vyasa compiled a Puranasamhita
 iske aage kii baat kaa pataa vishnu puraana se lagata he
 It says that Vyasa had a disciple named 'lomhadisha' who belonged to the Suti caste
 vyas ji ne apni puraana samhita usee ke haath main di
 Lomhadris had six disciples - Sumati, Agnivarcha, Mitrayu, Shanshapayan, Akitavran and Savarni
 inamen se akrutvran, saavarni or shanshpayan ne lomaharshan se padhi hui puranasamhita ke aadhaar par or ek ek samhita banaai
 Just as Ved Vyasa collected mantras and divided them into codes, similarly Puranasamhita was compiled by collecting circles coming in the name of Purana
 usee ek samhita ko lekar sut ke chelon ke teen or sanhitaayen banaai
 Eighteen Puranas would have been made on the basis of these codes
 matsay, vishnu, brahmad aadi sab puraanon main brahmpurana pehla kaha gaya he, par jo brahmpurana aajkal prachlit he vah kaisaa he yah pehle kaha ja chukaa he
 Whatever it is, it is proved from the above proof that eighteen Puranas are not made of Ved Vyasa
 jo puraana aajkal milte hai unamem vishnupurana or brahmadpurana kii rachana auron se pracheen jaan padati he
 The 'future dynasty' in the Vishnupurana mentions even the kings of the Gupta dynasty, this episode cannot be earlier than the sixth century of Christ
 java ke aage jo bali dweep he vahaan ke hinduon ke paas brahmandpurana mila he
 The ancestors of these Hindus settled in the islands of the East in India in the fifth century of Christ
 baliwaale brahmadpurana main 'bhavishya rajvansh prakaran' nahin he, usamen janamejay ke praputra adhisimakrishna tak kaa naam paaya jaataa he
 This is to be noted
 isse prakat hota he ki puraanon main jo bhavishya rajvansh he vah peeche se joda hua he
 The ancient copies of Brahmanda Purana are found here, to see how far the past and present-day action is used in them
 'bhavishyarajvansh varnan' ke purv unamem ye shloke milte hai— It is revealed from the above passage that the Adi Brahmapurana was made in the time of Adhishikrishna
 isi prakaar vishnupurana, matsaypurana aadi kii pariksha karne se pataa chalata he ki aadi vishnupurana parakshit ke samay main or aadi matsaypurana janamejay ke praputra adhisimakrishna ke samay main sankalit hua
 Eighteen Puranas from Purana Samhita were formed in very ancient times, it is known
 aapstamb dharmasutra main bhavishyapurana kaa pramaan is prakaar udadhrut he— It is a must that Puranas are not found in their primitive form nowadays
 bahut se puraana to asal puraanon ke na milane par phir se nae rache gaye hai, kuch main bahut si baaten jod di gai hai
 Almost all the Puranas are nutritious to one of the Shaiva, Vaishnava sect and solar sects, there is no doubt about it
 vishnu, rudra, surya aadi kii upasna vaidic kaal se hi chali aati thi, phir dhire dhire kuch log kisi ek devtaa ko pradhanta dene lage, kuch log duusare ko
 Thus the cults started behind the Mahabharata
 puranasamhitaayein usee samay main baniin
 Then later became Adipuranas, some of whose parts are within some Puranas found today
 puraanon kaa uddeshy puraane vritton kaa sangrah karnaa, kuch pracheen or kuch kalpit kathaon dwaara upadesh dena, devamahima tathaa tirthamahima ke varnan dwaara jansadharan main dharmbuddhi sthir rakhana tha
 From this, Vyas gave a man of sutra caste to propagate his collected Adipuran Samhita
 jain parampara main 63 shalakapurush maane gaye hai
 The Puranas have their stories and descriptions of religion etc
 praakrit, sanskrit, apbhransh tathaa anya deshi bhashaaon main anek puraanon kii rachana hui he
 The Puranas and literature of both the sects are available in large quantities
 inamen bhartiya itihaas kii mahatvapurn saamagree milti he
 In Jainism, 24 Puranas are named after Tirthakaras; There are many more, including the supernatural character of the Tirthankaras, their superiority to all the gods, detailed description of Jainism related elements, fruitfulness, greatness etc
 alag padmapurana or harivansh bhi hai
 The main Puranas are: 'adipuran' of Jinsen and 'arishtanemi' Purana of Jinsen, 'padmapurana' of Ravishana and 'uttapurana' of Gunabhadra
 praakrit or apbhransh bhashaaon main bhi ye puraana uplabdh hai
 These Puranas are very important in terms of India's culture, tradition, philosophical thought, language, style etc

 They are like this

 In the financial market, there is also a possibility of the price of any share bought going up and there is a possibility of going down
 share kaa bhav yadi neeche girane lagata he to vah kaaphi neeche pahunch saktaa he
 Hence its stop loss is fixed only when purchasing shares
 udhaahrantah yadi sau rupe kaa share liya gaya he, to 95 yaa 90 rupe aane par bech diya jaae
 What price to keep, or sell, even when the price reaches below it; This is the stop loss

 tyutan jatiyaan se europe kii un janajatiyon kaa bodh hota he jo vibhinn tyutan bhashaaon main se koi bhi ek bolti hai; udaahranarth -- british dweepasmoohon ke angreji bhashabhashi log; germany, aasria-hungary tathaa switzraland ke german bhashabhashi log; belgium ke flemish bhashi nivasee, sweden tathaa norway ke scadinavian bhashi log; holland tathaa denmark ke lagbhag sabhi nivasee; italy tathaa france ke german tathaa flemish bhashaayen bolanewaale alpsankhyak log, rus main nivas karanevaale german or swedish bhashaa bolanewaale adhikansh log tathaa america, africa or austrailesia main based hue ve log jo mulat: uparyukt deshon se vahaan gaye
 Like the nouns "germanic", "gothic", etc
, the origin of the word "tutanic" is now the subject of scholarly research
 saamaanya jan unke ek hi mul kii baat ab bhul gaye hai
 People were fully aware of this at the time of Tacitus
 usne jaanapad kavitaaon ke jo uddhran die hai unamem tyutan jatiyon ke mul purushon kaa ullekh he
 In those poems, a particular person named "manus" originated from three main branches of "germany", it is described
 pracheen angreji kaagaj patron main bhi in jatiyon ke mul purushon kii vanshawaliyaan milti hai
 There is considerable variation in these castes today in terms of physical formation and color
 lekin ye jatiyaan aaj europe kii sarvaadhik unchi tathaa gori jatiyaan hai
 These characteristics must have been very clear in the early period
 unchaa dealdol tathaa lanbaa cheharaa jo aaj europe ke sudur uttar bhaag main paaya jaataa he vaisaa hi switzraland tathaa uske aasapaas ke pradeshon kii puraani shmashaan bhoomi main gade kankalon tathaa khopadiyon main paaya jaataa he
 On the basis of these old relics, it is said that there is not much difference between the Teuton castes of today and their original men of that time
 uttar prastaryug ke praapt avasheshon se in jatiyon ke sambandh main adhik jaankaree nahin milti
 But Bronze Age research in the Valley of Alb, Mecklenburg, Halstein, Jutland, South Sweden and the Belt Islands sheds considerable light on the early civilization of the Tutan castes
 kala tathaa samruddhi kii drushti se ye log unnat the tathaa dakshini sabhyataa se inkaa vyapaar tathaa aadan pradaan chalata tha, aisa dikhaai detaa he
 The Celtic influence increased from the beginning of the Iron Age and the relations of the Tutan people with the centers of southern civilization gradually broke down
 germany, holland ityadi deshon ke nivasee apane keltic padosiyon se bhinn the, iske pramaan isa purv pehali shatabdi ke madhya se spasht rup se milte hai
 At this time the Romans knew them by the name "germani"
 yah naam sambhavat: galle logon kaa diya hua he or sarvapratham mus nadi kii ghati main rahanevaali katipay belgic jatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Early in the present era the Tutan castes extended from the Rhine to the Vistula
 sijar ke pehle ye rinalaangh chuki thim
 But Caesar's invasions stopped their spread
 rin ke donon taton par ye log based hue the par inamen se adhikansh jatiyaan roman samrajya kii praja thim
 The Tutan caste of the Far East was probably the "goth" caste in the Valley of the Vistula, and the Tutan castes of the far south were the "marcomani" and "kadi" who lived in the territories of Bohemia and Moravia
 ye pradesh inhone vartmaan yug ke prarambh main keltic logon se jeet liye the
 In the south and west, these people were suppressing the Celtic people and they had considerable share of Scandinavia in their possession
 isai kaal ke prarambh ke kuch varshon ke liye alb nadi ke pashchim ore kaa germany kaa kuch bhaag romanon ke adhikaar main tha lekin vaarus kii paraajay ke baad rin tathaa denube nadiyon tak roman samrajya fail gaya
 From the fourth to the sixth century, the Tutan castes had spread their legs in Europe
 kuch bhaag inhone jeeta tha or kuch bhaag romanon se sandhi kar paaya tha
 The fifth century is a very important period for Europe
 in sau varshon main europe main kai ladaaiyaan huin, kai jatiyon ne kai pradesh jite or europe kai rashtron main vibhakt ho gaya
 The Vandal race won Spain, the Visgoths conquered Italy and hoisted the flag over Rome, the southern Subeic nations, the Almanis and the Bavarians extended their kingdom to the Alps, the Franks abused the northern, the Burgundians occupied the eastern part, the Huns in Hungary
 The empire was formed and destroyed, Britain was annexed by the Anglo people, and Italy was attacked by the Astrogoths
 is tarah shatabdi ke ant tak adhikansh dakshini tathaa pashchimi europe tyutan jatiyon ke adhikaar main aa gaya
 In the sixth century, the Franks made the Burgundians and the Visgoths of the Gaal their Mandalik, the Romans regained Africa, the kingdom of the Astrogoths was overturned, Italy was occupied by the Longobardians, and the Slavonic castes occupied the ancient Tutan region of East Germany
 Established an empire
 is shatabdi ke ant tak bohemia, nimna austria or drev tathaa seve kii ghaatiyaan bhi slavonic ho gayi
 After the sixth century, the Tutan people gradually merged into territorial nationalities and today, except for the Scandinavian settlement of Iceland, there is no direct Tutan nation in Europe
 tansitus ne aisi tyutan jatiyon kaa varnan kiya he jinamein raja hota tha
 He has also described castes which were ruled by the chief
 usne tyutan raajaaon ke adhikaron kaa varnan kiya he
 According to him, his king had little influence on the western Tutan castes
 purv main goth jatiyon ke raajaaon ko kaaphi adhikaar the or sweed logon main to raja ko saarvbhaum adhikaar praapt the
 The king was considered a part of God and many dynasties told their origin to the gods
 europe kaa pashchimi bhaag videshi prabhaav ke kaaran kaaphi pragatisheel tha or gaal pradesh se to "raja" yaa rajpad kii samaapti hi ho chuki thi
 Tacitus has prominently described the "consilium" or ethnic assembly in relation to Germanic castes
 atyadhik mahatv ke vishyon main is sabha kaa nirnay antim mana jaataa tha
 In this assembly, the chiefs were elected, serious charges against members of the caste were considered and the youth were recruited into warriors
 kaarywahi kaa prarambh karne kii tathaa sabha main shanti banaae rakhane kii jimmedaari purohit kii hoti thi
 Therefore, this gathering was probably held near religious places and its primary form was religious
 tansitus ke baad in jaateey sabhaaon kaa bahut kam ullekh miltaa he
 Yes, when the Raja used to hold darbar on occasions of religious festivals and importance, sometimes there are mentions of public meetings
 lekin iskaa koi pramaan nahin miltaa ki shashan sambandhi masalon par in sabhaaon ne kabhi vichaar kiya ho
 Apart from "consilium", there was another institution which was very important at that time and which probably had the greatest impact on the history of the Tutan castes
 ise "komitats" kehete the
 Caesar describes it
 jab kisi jatipramukh ko nayaa abhiyaan karnaa hota tha to vah yah jansabha bulaata tha or anuyaayi praapt karnaa tha jo us abhiyaan main uskaa ant tak saath dete the
 The king and other prominent people used to keep armies of Tarun warriors in their jobs
 ye yoddha shanti ke samay main unki shaan badhaate the or ladaai main unke kaam aate the
 He was honest to his master till death
 aise kai ullekh milte hai jinke anusaar swami ko deshnikala milane par uske ashriton ne swechha se uskaa saath diya or uske saath gaye
 In exchange for this service, the owner honored him with money, horses and weapons
 swami yadi raja hua to unhen bhoomi detaa tha yaa apane rajya ke kisi bhaag kaa shashan saunp detaa tha
 In this way, people who received honors used to put their boys in the service of Swami
 is tarah ye jaagiren or adhikaar un vanshon ke pushtaini ban jate the
 From these came the rise of Jagirdars or Sardars, and on the other hand, officials of the Governor of large states
 tasitsri ke samay tyutan samaaj main teen varg the
 People of high descent, free people and free people
 aage chalakar bhi inhen teen virgon kaa varnan miltaa he
 Somewhere one of these half-classes also disappears
 udaahranarth frank jati main ucch varg kaa varnan nahin miltaa or kent pradesh ko chhodkar anya anglosaxn rajyon main mukt varg dikhaai nahin detaa
 These classes were dynastic and had different rights and facilities
 inamen se pramukh adhikaar yaa suvidha "manushya kaa mulya" hoti thi
 Each class had different values
 jab koi aadmi maaraa jaataa tha to uske parivaar, ashrith yaa swami kaa yah kartavya hota tha ki hatya kaa badla le
 But in the event of injury, the aggressor had to pay a set price as compensation
 seizar tathaa tasits ke kathananusaar tyutan samaajavyavastha main kutumb or parivarasanstha kaa pramukh sthaan tha
 It was considered an unanimous duty to provide protection to the family, help them in retaliation of injustice and to take revenge or recover damages in the context of their murder
 atev tyutan samaaj main badi sankhya main parijanon kaa hona suraksha tathaa prabhaav kii drushti se acha samajha jaataa tha
 When a person belonging to an upper class or an independent class was killed, the responsibility of paying the prescribed compensation was the responsibility of each family member along with the person who murdered
 usee prakaar harjaana vasuul hone par vah mrit vyakti ke parijanon main anupaat se bantataa tha
 The family used to share hands in the system of land
 tasits ke anusaar jaateey senaayen bhi parijanon se hi banati thim
 All simple forms of marriage were prevalent at that time
 kintu kent, pracheen sackson, langobardi tathaa bergandiyanon main mulya de kar vivaah karne kii pratha pramukh rup se prachlit thi
 Tacitas has also written that at the time of marriage arms and bulls were presented to the bride on her own behalf
 yah pratha uttar kii ore ke tyutan rashtron main praarambhik kaal se hi prachlit thi
 Specific information regarding marital acts is not available
 kintu yah kaha ja saktaa he ki vivaah ke purv vaagda main samaarambh tathaa uske baad daavat hoti thi

 But only in the magnet, all these microscopic fields become one in one direction and then a more powerful magnetic field, also known as net magnetic field, is produced

 The construction of the temple was never completed, so there is a lack of a foundation stone or a stone marking the opening / construction
 phir bhi yahaan kaa naam bhojpur hi he jo raja bhoj ke naam se hi judaa hua he
 According to some beliefs, this temple was to be built in one night, but its roofing work was done in the morning before completion, so the work remained incomplete

 haalanki aaj kii tithi main keval bhojpur mandir hi akelaa bachaa smarak he, jise raja bhoj ke naam ke saath joda ja saktaa he
 According to Prabandha Chintamani; When King Bhoj once visited Srimal, he told the poet Magha about the temple named Bhojaswamin which he was about to build
 iske uparant raja malwa ko laut gayi
 Though the Magh poet was not a contemporary of Raja Bhoj, the story seems to be anachronistic

 In the construction plan of this lake, King Bhoj built three dams of stone and sand

 The second dam kept the drainage of water by connecting the location between the two hills near present-day Mandua village and the third dam was built in place of today's Bhopal city which diverts the water of a small seasonal river Kaliyasot to this Betwa lake
 Used to give ye kritrim jalashay 15veen shatabdi tak bane rahe the
 According to a Gond legend, Malwa Naresh Hoshang Shah broke this dam with his army, which took him three months
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki yahan hoshangshah kaa ladkaa band ke sarovar main main dub gaya tha tathaa bahut dhundne par bhi uski laash tak nahin mili
 Enraged, he blew the dam with a cannon and tried to knock the temple down with a cannon too
 iske kaaran mandir kaa upar or bagal kaa hissaa gir gaya
 Due to the breakdown of this dam, all the water was washed away and then due to the abrupt termination of this immense water, the climate change was brought in the Malwa region

 The stone used in temple construction was obtained from the stony areas of Bhojpur itself
 mandir ke nikat se dur tak pattharon va chattaanon kii kataai ke avshesh dikhaai dete hai
 The author Vidya Dehejia's book Early Stone Temples of Odisha mentions that there is a similarity in the construction of the Shiva temple in Bhojpur and the Lingaraja temple in Bhubaneswar and some more temples
 bhojpur mandir main bahut se anokhe ghatak dekhne ko milte hai jinamein se kuch is prakaar se hai: garbhagrih prabhag se mandap kaa vilopan, mandir main gumbadakaar shikhar ke bajaay sidhi rekhiy chat aadi
 Three of the outer walls of the temple are completely flat from the exterior, but they are said to be of the 12th century
 in anokhe ghatakon ke adhyayan karne ke uparaant ek shodhakartta krishna dev kaa mat he ki sambhawatah ye mandir antyeshti aadi kriyakarm sambandhi kaaryon se sambandhit rahaa hoga; jaisaa praayah shmashaan ghat aadi ke nikatavartti aaj bhi dekhe ja sakate hai
 This research is also confirmed by some medieval architectural text discovered by Madhusudan Dhaki in due course
 in khandit paathyanshon se gyaat hua ki kai ucchkulin vyaktiyon kii mrityu uparaant unke avasheshon yaa antyeshti sthalon par ek smarak rupi mandir banavaa diya jaataa tha
 These types of temples were called swargaharana-prasada
 paath ke anusaar is prakaar ke mandiron main ekal shikhar ke sthaan par paraspar peeche kii ore ghatati hui pathar kii silliyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 According to Kirit Mankodi, the superstructure of the Bhojpur temple suits this format
 unke anumaan ke anusaar raja bhoj ne is mandir ko sambhawatah apane swargavaasi pita sindhuraj yaa taaoo vaakpati munj hetu banwaaya hoga, jinaki mrityu shatru kshetra main apmanjanak rup main hui thi
 Looking here, it appears that the construction work must have been stopped immediately
 haalanki iske kaaran abhi tak agyaat hi hai kintu itihaas vettaon kaa anumaan he ki aisa kisi prakritik aapadaa, sansadhano kii aapurti main kami athwa kisi yuddh ke armbh ho jane ke kaaran hi hua hoga
 The building did not even have a roof before its revival work began in 2006-07
 isse hi itihasvid kekemuhammad ne anumaan lagaaya ki chat sambhawatah nirmaan kaal main puure bhaar ke sahi akalan main ganitiya vaastu dosha ke kaaran nirmaan-kaal main hi dhah gayi hogi
 Then King Bhoj would have stopped the construction of the temple by not rebuilding it due to this defect

 Several quarry sites have also been found on the northern and eastern side of the temple, where incomplete crafts and crafts of various levels have also been found
 iske alaava mandir ke upree bhaag ke nirmaan hetu pathar ke baari shilp bhaagon ko khadaan se upar tak le jane ke liye bani bahut badi dhalaan bhi mili he
 Many sculptures have been found in such a way, brought from the mine near the temple

 The Archaeological Survey Department transferred them to its treasury house in the 20th century

 It is known from this plan that there was a plan to build a large temple complex in which many other temples were also to be built
 is yojana ke safaltapurvak sampann ho jane par ye mandir parisar bharat ke sabase bade mandir parisaron main se ek hota
 The temple building, near the mines and other two temples of the village have been identified with more than 1300 artisans
 inamen mandir ke mukhya dhaanche par vibhinn bhaagon main mili 50 shilpakaaron ke naam bhi sammilit hai
 Apart from these names, there are other identification marks, such as chakras, severed chakras, wheels, tridents, swastikas, conch shells and Nagari script marks, etc
 ye chihn shilpakaaron yaa unke parivaar ke logon ke kaary raashi ke anumaan yaa akalan hetu banaaye jate the, jinhen imaarat ko antim rup dete samay mitaa diye jate the, kintu mandir nirmaan purna na ho paane ke kaaran aise hi rah gayi
 An incomplete statue at the site khadaanon main se ek par mila ek sthapaty khand Sculptures found near the entrance varsh 1950 tak is imaarat kii sanrachana kaafii kamjor ho chali thi
 This was due to continuous rainwater leakage, the resulting damping and the removal of internal protective coating
 1951 main yah sthal pracheen smarak sangrakshan adhinium 1904 ke antargat bhartiya puratetvik surveykshan vibhaag ko sangrakshan evam punaruddhar hetu saunp diya gaya

 After this, the work stopped for some time
 varsh 2006-07 ke dauraan kekemuhammad ke adhinsth vibhaag ke ek dal ne smarak ke punaruddhar kaary ko punah armbh kiya
 He also restored a ruptured pillar of the structure

 After this was made, the team could not get such a long arm crane machine, due to which the team completed the work with the help of a series of winches and levers
 is shrunkhlaa ko banane main unhen chah maah kaa samay laga
 KK Muhammed found that the weight of the two pillars of the temple was 33 tons, and both of them were monolithic, so it would have been a challenging task for the erstwhile artisans in the absence of modern technology and resources
 isi team ne mandir kii chat ke khule bhaag ko bhi ek naye mul sanrachana se mail khate hue vaastu ghatak se badla
 Because these components are made of fiber-glass, one is far less in weight than that part of the original structure, so does not put unnecessary load on the structure, the other is also able to effectively prevent rainwater leakage

 is mandir kii chat gumbadakaar hai jabaki itihaaskaaron ke anusaar mandir kaa nirmaan bharat main islam ke aagaman ke pehle hua tha
 Therefore, the unfinished domed roof on the sanctum sanctorum of the temple proves the practice of dome construction in India as pre-islam
 haalanki islamic gumbadon se yahaan ke gumbad kii nirmaan kii takanic bhinn thi
 Hence, some scholars consider it as the first domed roof building in India

 The first step of any kind of biological analysis is the classification of it in a systematic way; Therefore, the first step in studying a plant, or animal, is its naming, classification and then description

 These are sixty times greater than the time of Linnaeus

 The botanists of this time were ahead of Aristotle's ideology
 unhone sthaneey paudhon kaa safal vargeekaran kar rakhaa tha
 Brunfels and Bauhin were scientists on the successful path of plant taxonomy, but the experts of this time classifying animals were still working under Aristotle's ideology

 With the development of knowledge, the number of these categories increased

 These categories are - Jagat, Sangha, class, Gana, clan, clan and caste
