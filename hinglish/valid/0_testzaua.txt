 During Shiva, the Minis gather at the Shiva house for prayers

 shiva minyaan main upasthiti mitzawa he, tathaapi yahaan aane waalon se singog main kiye jane vaale minyaan se vanchit nahin hona padataa he
 However, it is a common Ashkenaz custom to say: seferdik yahudiyon ke bich main aamtaur par kaha jaataa he: In both forms, the plural form / tenachamu) / tenachamu)) has been used
 seferdik samudaay main, chunki jerusalem kaa zikr karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, samvaad sthapit ho jaataa he tathaa matam karne vaale uttar dete hai "uvirushalayim tenuchamu " There are various restrictions on people sitting in Shiva, which are mostly rabbinically mandatory and tied to customary views: shiva vaale ghar main rah rahe anya log, jinhen shiva main baithne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, in pratibandhon se mukt hai, par unhen matam kar rahe vyakti kaa sammaan karnaa chahie tathaa uske matam tathaa pratibandhon ke paalan main koi baadha nahin daalani chahie
 It is necessary to wear a torn garment during the entire Shiva period
 Although the minimum requirement is to tear a garment, but 2-3 clothes are torn according to some minhagas
 yun to shiva ke dauraan kabhi bhi vastra phaade ja sakate hai par shabbat, shabbat ke kuch ghante pehle or us dauraan jab matam manaane vaala vyakti so rahaa ho, vastra faadane kaa nishedh he
 If that garment becomes sloppy during Shiva, it can be cleaned as per the requirement, but in a different way from the way the clothes are usually cleaned
 aam taur par matam manaane vaala vyakti shiva kaal ke dauraan us ghar ko chhod kar nahin ja saktaa, jahaan par shiva kaal chal rahaa he
 But there are many exceptions to this incident: aamtaur par, shiva ke dauraan vyapaar yaa anya koi kaary nahin kiya ja saktaa
 lekin iske apwaad bhi hai: Many restrictions continue throughout the Shloshim even after the seven-day mourning period, and in the event of the parents' death, there are restrictions that continue throughout the year
 adhikansh pratibandh prathagat hote hai, isliye unka paalan kar paane main vifal hone par kisi avera kaa pravidhan nahin he
 But according to Leviticus 10: 6: some restrictions are biblically ordained haalanki, vah vyakti jo shiva main baithne se puri tarah se inkaar kar detaa he kyonki use use apane mrit sambandhi kii koi parvaah nahin he or vah is kaal ke dauraan bhi is prakaar saamaanya jivan vyateet karata / karti he jaise kii kuch bhi nahin hua ho, to aise main vah vyakti anekon adeshon kaa ulanghan karata he
 The same applies for anyone who intentionally ignores the death of a close relative to avoid sitting in Shiva
 aisi avasthaa main jab paristhitiyon ke kaaran sampark nahin ho paata he, kisi vyakti ko uchit samay ke andar apane kisi najdiki sambandhi kii mrityu kii suchan nahin mil paatior dafan kiye jane ke baad hi uski mrityu kii soochna mil paati he to aise main shiva ko us din se prarambh mana jaataa he jab se mrityu kii soochna mili thi or yah samaapt bhi tabhi hota he jab anya rishtedaaron kaa shiva samaapt hota he
 There is no need to do Shiva for more days to complete it
 yadi kisi ko apane sambandhi kii mrityu kii soochna dafnaye jane ke ek saptaah baad milti he to vah soochna praapt hone vaale din se shiva par baith jaayegaa / jaaegi yadi ab tak shloshim kaal samaapt nahin hua he to
 shiva saat dinon kii avadhi kaa hi hoga, lekin sirf usee avasthaa main jab ki is kaal ke dauraan shloshim kaal bhi chal rahaa ho yaa yom tov shuru ho rahaa ho
 If the Shloshim period has ended, then Shiva is not followed
 But if the dead person was your mother or father, then the text of Kaddish and the year-long ban will still remain in effect
 yadi kisi ko maansik aswasthta ke kaaran uske sambandhi kii mrityu kii soochna nahi di ja sakati, aisi aswasthta joki us vyakti ko mrityu ke falswaroop hui is kshati ko samaj paane main asamarth kar detii he, yaa aisi koi shaareerik beemaari joki is samchhaar ko sunaane se bhayanak rup se bad sakati he, to aisi avasthaa main is soochna ko roak liya jaataa he or sambandhit vyakti shiva main nahin baithta he
 Some fundamentalist Jews sit on Shiva even when one of their relatives marries a non-jew
 sambhav he ki is prakaar ke vyavhaar kaa strot us sandigdh kathan ke padhe jane main he joki rabbenu gershaum ne apane bete dwaara isai dharm main parivartit ho jane par diya tha
 ! " film main jab jaiz gayak kaintor rabinowich ko yah pataa chalata he ki yassel rabinowich ek gaiyr yahudee ladke ke saath prem sambandh main he to vah keria hetu apane kapade faad detaa he or matam karne waalon ko kaddish kaa paath sunaane lagata he

 Kemer sent Rai to the agency's headquarters in London
 landan main bitaye teen maheenon main raay ne 99 filmein dekhin
 These included the neoliberal film Ladri di Bicicletta of Financorio de Sica, which impressed him even further
 raay ne baad main kaha ki ve cinema se baahar aae to film nirdeshak banane ke liye drudhsankalp the
 The success in films did not change Rai's family life too much
 ve apni maan or parivaar ke anya sadasyon ke saath hi ek kiraye ke makaan main rahete rahe
 In the 1960s, Rai traveled to Japan and met well-known film director Akira Kurosawa
 bharat main bhi ve aksar shahar ke bhaagam-bhaag vaale maahaul se bachane ke liye darjeeling yaa puri jaisi jagahon par jaakar ekaant main kathanak puure karte the

 inaki mrityu hone par kolkata shahar lagbhag thahar gaya or hazaron log inke ghar par inhen shradhanjali dene aae
 Rai had decided that his first film would be based on the famous Bildungsaromon Pather Panchali of Bengali literature, written in 1928 by Bibhuti Bhushan Bandyopadhyay
 is ardh-aatmakathaatmak upanyaas main ek bengali gaanv ke ladke apu ke bade hone kii kahani he
 Rai designed the film during his return voyage from London to India
 bharat pahunchne par raay ne ek karmidal ekatrit kiya jisamen cameraman subrat mitra or kala nirdeshak bansi chandragupta ke alaava kisi ko filmon kaa anubhav nahin tha
 The actors were also almost all unprofessional
 film kaa chhayankan 1952 main shuru hua
 Rai invested his money in this film, in the hope that the first few shots would get money from somewhere, but it did not happen
 pather panchali kaa chhayankan teen varsh ke lambe samay main hua — jab bhi raay yaa nirmaan prabandhak anil choudhary kahin se paison kaa jugad kar pate the, tabhi chhayankan ho paata tha
 Rai refused to take money from sources who wanted to change the plot or supervise the filmmaker
 1955 main pashchim bengal sarkaar ne film ke liye kuch rin diya jisase aakhirkaar film puri hui
 The government also wanted to make some changes in the film but Satyajit Rai paid no attention to it
 pather panchali 1955 main pradarshit hui or bahut lokapriy rahi
 In India and other countries also it was engaged in cinema for a long time
 bharat ke aalochakon ne ise bahut saraahaa
 The Times of India wrote - “to compare it to any other Indian cinema is meaningless
 pather panchali to shuddh cinema he
 Lindsey Anderson in the United States wrote a very good review about the film
 lekin sabhi aalochak film ke bare main itane utsahit nahin the
 François Truffo said - "I do not see a film showing people eating food by hand
" ” new york times ke prabhaavshaalee aalochak bozli crouther ne bhi pather panchali ke bare main bahut buree samiksha likhi
 Despite this, the film went on for a long time in America
 raay kii agali film aparajito kii safalataa ke baad inkaa antararashtriya karier puure jor-shor se shuru ho gaya
 The film depicts the frequent stretch between the aspirations of a young man and his mother
 mrinal sen or ruthvik ghatak sahit kai aalochak ise pehali film se behatar maanate hai
 Aparajito was awarded the Swarn Singh at the Venice Film Festival
 apu trayee puri karne se pehle raay ne do or filmein banaain — hasyaprad parsh pathar or zameendaaron ke patan par aadhaarit jalsaghar
 The aquarium is counted among his most important works
 aparajito banaate hue raay ne trayee banane kaa vichaar nahin kiya tha, lekin venice main uthe ek prashn ke baad unhen yah vichaar acha laga
 The final episode of this series, Apur Sansar, was formed in 1959
 raay ne is film main do nae abhinaytaon, saumitr chatarji or sharmila tagore, ko mauka diya
 In this film, Apu lives in poverty in a simple house in Kolkata and gets married to Aparna, after which he has to face many difficulties
 pichhali do filmon kii tarah hi kuch aalochak ise trayee kii sabase badhiya film maanate hai 
 When a Bengali critic strongly criticized the Apur Sansar, Rai wrote a long article in response to this
 is avadhi main raay ne kai vishyon par filmein banaain, jinamein shaamil hai, british kaal par aadhaarit devi, rabindranath thakur par ek vruttchitr, hasyaprad film mahapurush or moulik kathanak par aadhaarit inaki pehali film kanchanajangha 
 During this time, he made many such films, which together are considered to be the deepest portrayal of women in Indian cinema
 apur sansar ke baad raay kii pehali film thi devi, jisamen inhone hindu samaaj main andhvishwaas ke vishay ko tatola he
 Sharmila Tagore played the main character of the film, Dayamayi, who is considered to be an incarnation of her father-in-law Kali
 raay ko chintaa thi ki is film ko sensor board se shaayad sweekruti nahin mili, yaa unhe kuch drishy kaatane paden, lekin aisa nahin hua
 In 1961, at the insistence of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Rai made a documentary on Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur's birth centenary on his life
 thakur ke jivan kaa filmakan bahut kam hi hua tha, isliye raay ko mukhyatah sthir chitron kaa prayog karnaa padaa, jisamen unke anusaar teen fichar filmon jitna parishram hua
 In the same year, Rai along with Subhash Mukhopadhyay and other writers revived the children's magazine Sandesh
 is patrika kii shuruyaat inke dada ne shuru kii thi or bahut samay se raay iske liye dhan jamaa karte aa rahe the
 Sandesh means two-way in Bangla - one is news and the other is sweets
 patrika ko isi mul vichaar par banaaya gaya — shiksha ke saath-saath manoranjan
 Rai soon started drawing himself in magazines and writing stories and essays for children
 aane vaale varshon main lekhan inaki jeevika kaa pramukh saadhan ban gaya
 In 1962, Rai directed Kanchanjangha, in which he first did colorful cinematography on the original plot
 is film main ek ucch varg ke parivaar kii kahani he jo darjeeling main ek dopaher bitaate hai or prayaas karte hai ki sabase choti beti kaa vivaah landan main padhe ek kamau ejeeniyar ke saath ho jaae
 Initially the idea was to portray the film in a sprawling mansion, but Rai later decided to use the Darjeeling atmosphere and play of light and fog to showcase the plot vibe
 raay ne hansi main ek baar kaha ki unki film kaa chhayankan kisi bhi roshni main ho saktaa tha, lekin usee samay darjeeling main maujuud ek vyavsaayik film dal ek bhi drishy nahin shoot kar paaya kyonki unhone keval dhoop main hi shooting kerani thi
 In 1964, Rai made a Charulata film, which many critics consider to be his most masterminded film
 yah thakur kii laghukatha nashtnid par aadhaarit he
 It contains the story of a lonely 19th-century woman who falls in love with her brother-in-law
 ise raay kii sarvotkrisht kriti mana jaataa he
 Rai himself said that it has the least flaws and this is the only film that he will recreate in the same way when he gets a chance
 chaaru ke rup main madhavi mukherjee ke abhinay or subrat mitra or bansi chandragupta ke kaam ko bahut saraahaa gaya he
 Other films of this period are: Mahanagar, Teen Kanya, Abhiyan, Kapurush and Mahapurush
 charulatha ke baad ke kaal main raay ne vividh vishyon par aadhaarit filmein banaain, jinamein shaamil hai, kalpanakthaayen, vigyankathaayen, guptchar kathaayen or aitihaasik naatak
 Rai started experimenting on new techniques in films and focusing on contemporary themes in India
 is kaal kii pehali mukhya film thi nayak, jisamen ek film abhinayta rail main safar karte hue ek mahila patrkaar se miltaa he
 The film, based on 24-hour events, explores the psychology of this famous actor
 berlin main is film ko aalochak puraskaar mila, lekin anya pratikriyaayein adhik utsaahpurn nahin raheen
 In 1967, Rai wrote the script for a film called To Be The Alien
 yah inaki laghukatha bankubabur bandhu par aadhaarit thi jise inhone sandesh patrika ke liye 1962 main likhaa tha
 The producer of this america-india co-production project was a company called Colombia Pictures
 peter sellers or marlan brando ko isaki mukhya bhoomikaaon ke liye chunaa gaya
 Rai was surprised to learn that his plot had been taken over by someone else
 brando baad main is pariyojna se nikal gaye or raay kaa bhi is film se moh-bhang ho gaya
 Colombia attempted to revive the project several times in the 1970s and 80s, but the matter never progressed
 raay ne is pariyojna kii asafalataa ke kaaran 1980 ke ek site and sound praaroop main ginaae hai or anya vivaran inke aadhikarik jeevani lekhak andru robinson ne da inner aai main diye hai
 When in 1982 E
T
 When the film was released, Rai saw many similarities between his plot and the film
 raay kaa vishwaas tha ki steven spilberg kii yah film unke kathanak ke bina sambhav nahin thi 
 In 1969, Rai made his most commercially successful film - Guppy Gine Bagha Baine
 yah sangitamay film inke dada dwaara likhi ek kahani par aadhaarit he
 The king of ghosts gives three boons to the singer Goopi and Dholi Bagha, with the help of which they stop the war in two neighboring countries
 yah raay ke sabase kharchile udhyamon main se thi or iske liye puunji bahut mushkil se mili
 Rai eventually had to abandon the idea of making it colorful
 raay kii agali film thi aranyer dinaraatri, jisaki sangeet-sanrachana charulatha se bhi jatil maani jaati he
 It has the story of four young men who go to the jungle for holiday
 isamen simi gareval ne ek junglee jati kii aurat kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 Critics consider it an image of the mentality of the Indian middle class
 iske baad raay ne samasamyik bengali vaastaviktaa par dhyaan dena shuru kiya
 The Naxalite revolution was gaining momentum in Bengal at that time
 aise samay main navayuvakon kii maansikta ko lekar inhone kalakatta trayee ke naam se jane vaali teen filmein banaain — pratidwandvi, seemaabaddh or jayeerany 
 The imagery of these three films differs but the themes of these together take the form of a trilogy
 pratidwandvi ek adarshavaadi navayuvak kii kahani he jo samaaj se moh-bhang hone par bhi apane adarsh nahin tyaagta he
 In this, Rai adopted a new style of storytelling, in which he used scenes, dream scenes and accidental flash-backs in the negative
 jayeerany film main ek navayuvak kii kahani he jo jeevika kamaane ke liye bhrasht rahon par chalane lagata he
 a successful young man gives up his ethics in order to earn more money
 raay ne 1970 ke dashak main apni do lokapriy kahaniyon — sonar kella or joy baba felunath — kaa filmakan kiya
 Both films were very popular among both children and adults
 raay ne bangladesh mukti yuddh par bhi ek film banane kii sochi, lekin baad main yah vichaar tyaag diya kyonki unhen raajnneeti se adhik sharnaarthiyon ke palaayan or haalat ko samajhane main adhik ruchi thi
 In 1977, Rai made a chess player film based on the story of Munshi Premchand
 yah urdu bhashaa kii film 1857 ke bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke ek varsh pehle avadh rajya main lakhanu shahar main kendrit he

 Satyajit Rai believed that writing the plot is an integral part of direction
 yah ek kaaran he jisaki vajah se unhone prarambh main bangla ke atirikt kisi bhi bhashaa main film nahin banaai
 For both his films made in other languages, he first wrote the plot in English, which was translated by the translators into Hindi or Urdu under his supervision
 raay ke kala nirdeshak bansi chandragupta kii drushti bhi raay kii tarah hi paini thi

 Rai praised Mitra very much, but Rai used to make films with such concentration that Rai started running the camera himself after Charulata, due to which Mitra stopped working for Rai from 1966
 mitra ne bouns-prakaash kaa sarvapratham prayog kiya jisamen ve prakaash ko kapade par se oochaal kar vaastavik prathit hone vaala prakaash rach lete the
