 The names of these five gurus are - Guru Nanak, Guru Angaddev, Guru Amardas, Guru Ramdas and Guru Arjun Dev
 sheikh farid, jayadev, trilochan, sadhana, namdev, veni, ramanand, kabir, ravidaas, peepa, saitha, dhanna, bheekhan, parmanand or surdaas 15 santon kii vaani ko aadigranth main sangrahit karke guruji ne apni udaar maanavtaavaadi drushti kaa parichay diya
 Not only this, he ranked the compositions of 14 creators like Haribans, Balha, Mathura, Gaynd, Nalh, Bhalla, Salh Bhikkha, Kirat, Bhai Mardana, Sundardas, Rai Balwand and Satta Doom, Kalsahar, Jalap and gave them a high status
 did
 yah adbhut kaary karte samay guru arjuna dev ke saamne dharm jati, kshetra or bhashaa kii kisi seemaa ne avrodh paidaa nahin kiya
 He knew that all these gurus, saints and poets have the same cultural, ideological and thinking base
 ullekhneey he ki guru arjunadev ne jab aadigranth kaa sampaadan-kaary 1604 i
 main purna kiya tha tab usamen pehle paanch guruon kii vaniyan thim
 After this Guru Gobind Singh finalized the Adigranth by incorporating the voice of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur
 aadi-granth main 15 santon ke kul 778 pad hai
 Of these 541 are from Kabir, 122 from Sheikh Farid, 60 from Namdev and 40 from Sant Ravidas
 anya santon ke ek se chaar padon kaa aadi granth main sthaan diya gaya he
 It is worth noting that these compositions stored in Adi Granth are completely safe without any change for more than 400 years
 lekin apane dehavsaan ke purv guru govind singh ne sabhi sikhon ke aadhyatmik maargdarshan ke liye guru granth sahab or unke sansaarik disha-nirdesan ke liye samooche khalsa panth ko ‘guru pad’ par asin kar diya
 At that time Adigranth came to be accepted as Guru Sahib
 sikh dharm ko kaaljayi banane ke liye guru govind singh ne sabhi dharmon or jatiyon ke logon ko guru-shishy-parampara main dikshit kiya
 He created this new human being for centuries to come
 yah nayaa manushya jatiyon evam dharmon main vibhakt na hokar dharm, maanav evam desh ke sangrakshan ke liye sadaiv katibaddh rahane vaala he
 This structure of taking everyone along is, no doubt, the Sikh psyche
 phir, sikh dharm kaa param lakshya maanav-kalyaan hi to he
 Perhaps to teach the lesson of this human welfare, Guru Govind Singh wrote a long letter to Aurangzeb, which mentions the praise of God as well as the poignant mention of injustice and atrocities that took place during Aurangzeb's reign
 is patr main nek karm karne or maasoom praja kaa khun na bahaane kii naseehaten, dharm evam ishwar kii aad main makkaari or jhooth ke liye chetavanee tathaa yoddha kii tarah maidan jang main aakar yuddh karne ke liye lalkaar he
 It is said that Aurangzeb's rage arose after reading this letter and after that he did not live long
 guru ji se ek baar bhent karne kii uski andaruni ichha bhi puri na ho saki
 It is not a credit to be given that the values on which the simple, simple, simple and natural life of the Sikh Gurus was based, they had certainly adopted those values from the traditional Indian consciousness
 desh, kaal or paristhitiyon kii maang ke anusaar unhone apane vyaktitv ko dhalkar tatkaaleen rajnatik, saamaajik, dharmik, aarthik evam saanskrithik jivan ko gahare main prabhavit kiya tha
 Sikh Gurus influenced the religion and social order of their time
 sikh guruon ne apane samay ke dharm or samaaj-vyavastha ko ek nai disha di
 He removed devotion, knowledge, worship, spirituality and philosophy from a narrow circle and brought the society among those who were completely deprived of it
 isse logon kaa aatmbodh jaagaa or unamem ek nai drushti evam jagriti panpi, ve swanubhoot anubhav ko manyata dene lage
 In this way the flow of the formless ultimate power was intensified and quickly received
 sikh dharm kii ek anya marke kii vishistataa yah he ki sikh guruon ne manushya ko udhyam karte hue jivan jeene, kamaate hue sukh praapt karne or dhyaan karte hue prabhu kii prapti karne kii baat kahi
 He believed that a person who works hard remains free from all worries
 guru nanak ne to yahan tak kaha he ki jo vyakti mehnat karke kamata he or usamen kuch daan-punya karata he, vahi sahi maarg ko pahachaanata he
 The 'langar' system introduced by Sikh Gurus is an example not found elsewhere in cosmopolitanism, human love, equality and generosity
 sikh guruon ne kabhi na murajhaane vaale saanskrithik evam naitik mulyon kii bhi sthapana kii
 He had foreseen with his philosophical and spiritual thinking what the time would be like
 isliye unhone andhi nakal ke khilaaf vaikalpik chintan par jor diya
 Physical practice and humor is considered to be an essential part of life
 punjab ke lokgeeton, lokanrutyon evam hola mahallaa par shastradhariyon ke pradarshit kartabon ke mul main sikh guruon ke prerana-beej hi hai
 The roots of these folk songs and folk dances erupt from the soil of Punjab and cause panic among the people
 bhangada or giddha punjab kii saanskrithik shaan hai, jisaki dhadkan desh-videsh main praaia: suni jaati he
 Punjabi culture is the backbone of nationality
 iske praan main ekatv he, iske rakt main sahanubhuti, sahyog, karunaa or maanav-prem he
 Punjabi culture connects man and builds his identity
 vishwa ke kisi kone main ghumta-phirata punjabi swayan main se ek laghu punjab kaa praturup he
 Every Sikh has his or her own independent consciousness, which has been seriously thinking about solving life-related problems in its own light
 sikh guruon kaa itihaas uthaakar dekh lijie, unhone samrajyavaadee avadharana katai nahin banaai, ulte saanskriti, k dharmik evam aadhyatmik saamanjasy ke madhyam se maanavtaavaadi sansar kii drushti hi karte rahe
 The people of this earth have maintained their peaceful existence in spite of the period of indo-pak partition before independence and several decades after the violent violence and persecution in Punjab
 kaundh inkaa maargdarshan karti rahi he
 Sikhs have ten gurus
 shri guru granth sahib ji sikhon kaa dharmik granth he
 Sikhism begins with "one"
 sikhon ke dharm granth main "ek" kii hi vyakhya hai
 One is known by the names of Nirankara, Parbrahma etc
 nirankaar kaa swaroop shri gurugranth sahib ke shuruyaat main bataaya he jisko aam bhashaa main 'mul mantra' kehete hai
 Almost all religions worship this "one", but the various stages of "one" are mentioned and explained in Shri Guru Granth Sahib ji is unique in itself
 jeev aatma jo niraakaar he, us ke paas nirankaar ke sirf 4 hi gun vyaapt he As soon as the other four qualities are attained, the living soul goes back to Nirankar, but in order to attain it, it is necessary for the living soul to understand itself through the knowledge of Gurmat
 ise sikh dharm main "aatam chintan" kaha jaataa he
 The formless form of the soul is known in the basic Sikhs of Sikhism
 in kii gatividhion ko samaj kar insaan khud ko samaj saktaa he
 Sikhism begins with soul knowledge
 aatma kya he? kaha se ai he? vajood kyon he? karnaa kya he itihaadi ruhaniyat ke vishe sikh prachaar dwaara padhaaye jate hai
 What are the disorders of the soul, how should the disorder be free aatma swayam nirankaar kii ansh he
 Gets knowledge of nirankara by making it known
 sikhmat carmik falsafe main yakeen nahin rakhata
 Other religions say that God likes good deeds and God does very bad things with those who are bad
 lekin sikh dharm ke anusaar insaan khud kuch kar hi nahin saktaa
 a human being is limited to thinking only, that is what is in the "order", whether it is donating to a poor person or if he is killing someone
 yahi baat shri gurugranth sahib ji ke shuru main hi drudh karvaa di thi : That is why sin is not accepted in Gurmat
 agar insaan koi kriya karata he to wo antar aatma ke saath awaz mila kar kare
 It is Karna that Gurmat is against Karma scandal
 shri guru nanak dev ji ne apane samay ke bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt kuprathaon, andhvishwaason, jarjar roodhiyon or pakhandon ko dur karte hue jan-saadhaaran ko dharm ke thekedaaron, pandon, piron aadi ke changul se mukt karne kii koshish kii
 It is mandatory for the following four 'substances' to be received by humans in their lifetime: dharm, arth, kaam, moksh ko chaar padaarthon main nahin liya gaya
 Mr
 Guru Gobind Singh Ji says: sikhamat main bhakton evam satguron ne nirankaar ko akar rahit kaha he
 Because earthly substances are finished one day but Parabrahma never dies
 isi liye use akaal kaha gaya he
 Not only this, the living soul is also devoid of form and is tied with this body for some time
 iskaa vajood sharir ke bagaiyr bhi he, jo aam manushya kii budhi se dur he
 It is Karna that Sikhism is strongly against idol worship
 satguruon evam bhakton ne murti pujakon ko andha, jaanavar itiyadi shabdon se niwaja he
 His picture cannot be made
 yahi nahin koi bhi sansari padaarth jaise kii kabar, bhakton evam satguruon ke itihaasak padaarth, pratimaayein adik ko poojana sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf he
 Knowledge of religious texts is a method that leads to the country of Nirankar, before which the Sikhs bow down, but the worship of religious texts is also against the basic principles of Sikhs
 sikhamat main har jeev ko avatar kaha gaya he
 Every living being is part of that nirankar
 sansar main koi bhi panchi, pashu, ped, itiyadi avatar hai
 In the cunt of Manush, the creature has descended to complete his knowledge
 vyakti kii puja sikh dharm main nahin he "maanukh ki tech birthi sab jaanat, dene, ko eke bhagwaan"
 All avatars do not come full on the condition of a nirankar
 yahi kaaran he kii sikh kisi ko paramatior ke rup main nahin maanate
 Yes, if an avatar preaches Gurmat then Sikhs are definitely associated with that sermon
 jaisaa kii krishna ne gita main kaha he kii aatma marati nahin or jeev hatya kuch nahin hoti, is baat se to sikhamat sahamat he lekin aage krishna ne kaha he kii karm hi dharm he jis se sikh dharm sahamat nahin
 Prophet is one who spread the message or knowledge of Nirankar in the common folk
 jaisaa kii islam main kaha he kii mohammad aakhri paigambar he sikhon main kaha gaya he ki "har jug jug bhakt upaaya"
 Devotees are born equal and spread the message of Nirankar to the people
 sikhamat "laa elaha ill allaah " se sahamat he lekin sirf mohammad hi rasul allaah he is baat se sahamat nahin
 Arjun Dev ji says "dhur ki baani aayi, tein sagli chinta mittai", meaning that i have uttered a voice and my real concerns have disappeared that i have found it in whose eyes i was sitting
 mul rup main bhakton avam satguruon kii vaani kaa sangreh jo satguru arjuna dev ji ne kiya tha jise aadi granth kaha jaataa he sikhon ke dharmik granth ke rup main prasiddh he | yah granth 36 bhakton kaa sachaa upadesh he or ascharyajanak baat ye he kii 36 bhakton ne nirankaar ko sam drushti main vyaakhyaan kiya he | kisi shabd main koi bhinnata nahin he | sikh aadi granth ke saath saath dasam granth, jo kii satguru gobind singh ji kii vaani kaa sangreh he ko bhi maanate hai | yah granth khalse ke adheen he | par mul rup main aadi granth kaa gyaan lenaa hi sikhon ke liye sarvopriya he | Not only this, the Sikhs respect every scripture in which Gurmat is preached
 aadi granth yaa aadi guru granth yaa guru granth sahib yaa aadi guru darbar yaa pothee sahib, guru arjuna dev dawaara sangrihith ek dharmik granth he jisame 36 bhakton ke atmik jivan ke anubhav darj hai | aadi granth is liye kaha jaataa he kyonki isamen "aadi" kaa gyaan bharpoor he | jap bani ke mutabik "sach" hi aadi he | iskaa gyaan karwaane vaale granth ko aadi granth kehete hai | iske hawaale swayam aadi granth ke bheetar hai | halaaki vidwan tabaka kahata he kyonki ye granth main guru teg bahadur ji kii bani nahin thi is liye yah aadi granth he or satguru gobind singh ji ne 9wein mahale kii bani chadhaai is liye is aadi granth kii jaganh guru granth kaha jane laga | Satguru Arjun Dev ji was present in the form of speech books of devotees and Satgurus
 Bhai Gurdas Ji wrote this book and Satguru Arjun Dev became the guide
 He also recorded his speech in the book
 Many copies of this book were also prepared
 aadi granth ke 1430 panne khalsa dawaara maanakit kiye gaye | The Dasam Granth is a Sikh scripture which is a collection of the sacred words and compositions of Satgur Gobind Singh Ji
 guru gobind singh ji ne apane jeevankaal main anek rachanaayen kii jinaki choti choti pothiyaan bana deen
 After his death, on the orders of his religious wife Mata Sundari, Bhai Mani Singh Khalsa and other Khalsa brothers collected all the works of Guru Gobind Singh ji and put it in a book which is today called "dasam Granth"
 sidhe shabdon main kaha jaye to guru gobind singh ji ne rachana kii or khalse ne sampadanaa kii
 The entire Sikh community is entertained by the Dasam Granth
 dasam granth kii vaaniyaan jaise kii jaap sahib, tav parasaad savaiye or chopai sahib sikhon ke rojaanaa sajadaa, nitnem, kaa hissaa he or yah vaaniyaan khande bate kii pahole, jis ko aam bhashaa main amrit chakna kehete hai, ko banaate vakt padhi jaati hai
 In the gurudwaras of Takhat Hazur Sahib, Takhat Patna Sahib and Nihang Singh, the Dasam Granth is lighted with Guru Granth Sahib and is also taken daily
 sarbloh granth ore bhai gurdas kii vaaren shankaa grast rachanaae hai | halaaki khalsa mahima sarbloh granth main susajit he jo satguru gobind singh kii pramanit rachana he, baaki srbloh granth main karm cond, vyakti puja itiyadi vishe mojood hai jo sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf hai | bhai gurdas kii vaaron main murti puja, karm sidhaant adik gurmat viruddh shabd darj hai No historical source is considered complete for the history of Sikhism
 Sri Guru Sobha has assumed such a book which has been written by a Sikh near Gobind Singh but dates are not given in it
 There are other historical texts of Sikhs such as Shri Guru Pratap Suraj Granth, Gurbilas Patshahi 10, Shri Gur Sobha, Manhima Prakash and Panth Prakash, Janamsakhiya Itiyadi
 Sri Guru Pratap Suraj Granth is explained in Gurdwaras
 Once Gurbilas Patshahi was 10
 Most of the history has been written after 1750
 The scholars who wrote history were mostly Sanatani, due to which, in some historical books, Satguru and devotees have shown miraculous, which according to Gurmat philosophy is not right
 Guru Nanak flying in the air, riding a crocodile, Baba Budha's oblation of Mata Ganga is embodied in the historical events of Jamsakhis and Gurbilas and later historians have written these things by putting a spice on them
 No Satgur and devotee wrote their world history
 Satguru Gobind Singh has also written as much as he has written briefly and bluntly
 Sikhism does not give much importance to history, which is useful for understanding Sikhism as much as it is useful for Sikhism
 aaj sikh itihaas kaa shuddhikaran karne main lage hai

 The prescribed solutions of the differential equation of basal are called the basal function
 basal ke avakal sameekaran kaa saamaanya rup neeche diya gaya he- α is any real or complex number
 sabase aam or mahatvapurn sthitiyaan α ke purnank athwa ardh purnank maanon ke liye aati hai
 These functions were first defined by Bernoulli and later Basel generalized them
 basal falnon ko belan falan yaa 'belan sannaadi' bhi kehete hai kyonki ye laplas sameekaran ko belani nirdeshaank pranali main badalakar hal karne se praapt hote hai
 The basal function appears when the Laplace equation and the Helmholts equation try to find a discrete solution in the Belly coordinate system or in the spherical coordinate system
 is kaaran basal falan tarang gati or sthatik vibhav kii samasyaon ke liye vishesh rup se mahatvapurn hai
 When attempting to solve problems in the Bellany coordinate system, basal functions with integer orders are obtained; And when taken out in spherical coordinates tomorrow, the basal functions of semi-integer order are found
 udhaaharan ke liye- In addition to the above, there are other properties of basal functions that can be used in other types of problems; Such as in signal processing
 , kaisar vindo yaa basal filter) The basal function for α = n is called the first type of basal function and is represented by j n { \ displaystyle J_ {n}}

 But it is not that Morarji was not eligible to become Prime Minister
 vastut: vah durbhaagyashaalee rahe ki varishthatam netaa hone ke baavzood unhen pandit nehru or bahadur shastri ke nidhan ke baad bhi pradhanmantri nahin banaaya gaya
 Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister of the country in March 1977 but his term as Prime Minister could not be completed
 choudhary charan singh se matbhedon ke chalate unhen pradhanmantri pad chhodana padaa
 Morarji Desai was born on 29 February 1896 at a place called Bhadeli in Gujarat
 unka sambandh ek brahman parivaar se tha
 His father Ranchodji Desai was a school teacher in Bhavnagar
 vah avsaad se grast rahete the, at: unhone kuen main kud kar apni igalila samaapt kar lee
 Morarji Desai was married on the third day of his father's death
 morarji desai kii shiksha-diksha mumbai ke elfinston college main hui jo us samay kaafii mahangaa or kharchila mana jaataa tha
 Morarji Desai lived in a free house in Mumbai which was known as Gokuldas Tejpal
 ek samay main vahaan 40 shikshaarthi rah sakate the
 Morarji Desai was a wise student of average intelligence in his student life
 inhen college kii vaad-vivaad team kaa sachiv bhi banaaya gaya tha lekin swayan morarji ne mushkil se hi kisi vaad-vivaad pratiyogita main hissaa liya hoga
 Morarji Desai had heard the conversations of Mahatma Gandhi, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and other Congress leaders during his college life
 morarji desai ne mumbai provinshal civil sarvice hetu aavedan karne kaa man banaaya jahaan sarkaar dwaara sidhi bhartee kii jaati thi
 In July 1917, he got admission in the university training course
 yahan inhen british vyaktiyon kii bhanti samaan adhikaar evam suvidhaayen praapt hoti raheen
 Morarji became an officer while living here
 may 1918 main vah pariviksha par bataur up ziladhish ahmedabad pahunche
 He worked under a British collector named Chetfield
 morarji 11 varshon tak apane ruukhe swabhaav ke kaaran vishesh unnati nahin praapt kar sake or colector ke nijee sahaayak pad tah hi pahunche
 Morarji Desai quit the British government job in 1930 and became a soldier of the freedom struggle
 1931 main vah gujarat pradesh kii congress cameti ke sachiv ban gaye
 He established the branch of the All India Youth Congress and became its president on the instructions of Sardar Patel
 1932 main morarji ko 2 varsh kii jail bhugatni padi
 Morarji remained Secretary of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee till 1937
 iske baad vah bombai rajya ke congress mantrimandal main sammilit hue
 During this time it was believed that Morarji Desai's personality had complications
 vah swayan apni baat ko upar rakhte hai or sahi maanate hai
 For this reason people used to sarcastically call him the 'supreme leader'
 morarji ko aisa kaha janaa pasand bhi aata tha
 Saturdays were also published in Gujarat newspapers about his personality
 cartoonon main inke chitra ek lambii chadi ke saath hote the jisamen inhen gandhi topi bhi pahane hue dikhaaya jaataa tha
 It used to be a satire that a stubborn person, influenced by Gandhiji's personality but sticking to his word
 swatantraaa sangram main bhagidaari ke kaaran morarji desai ke kai varsh zelon main hi guzare
 At the time of the country's independence, his name had gained weight in national politics
 lekin morarji kii praathmik ruchi rajya kii raajnneeti main hi thi
 That is why he was made the Chief Minister of Bombay in 1952
 is samay tak gujarat tathaa maharashtra bombai provins ke naam se jane jate the or donon rajyon kaa pruthak gathan nahin hua tha
 After Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1967, Morarji was made Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister
 lekin vah is baat ko lekar kunthit the ki varisht congress netaa hone par bhi unke bajaay indira gandhi ko pradhanmantri banaaya gaya
 This is the reason why Morarji continued to obstruct the revolutionary measures being taken by Indira Gandhi
 darasal jis samay shri kamraj ne syndicate kii salaah par indira gandhi ko pradhanmantri banaae jane kii ghoshnaa kii thi tab morarji bhi pradhanmantri kii daud main shaamil the
 When he did not agree in any way, the party held the election on this issue and Indira Gandhi won the election with a heavy vote
 indira gandhi ne morarji ke ahan kii tushti ke liye inhen up pradhanmantri kaa pad diya
 The discipline in the Congress at the time of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru began to disintegrate after his death
 kai sadsy swayan ko party se bada samajhate the
 Morarji Desai was also one of them
 shri bahadur shastri ne congress party ke vafaadaar sipaahi kii bhanti kaary kiya tha
 He had never demanded any position from the party
 lekin is maamle main morarji desai apwaad main rahe
 His differences with the Congress organization were well known and becoming Prime Minister of the country included his priorities
 indira gandhi ne jab yah samaj liya ki morarji desai unke liye kathinaaiyaan paidaa kar rahe hai to unhone morarji ke par katarma armbh kar diya
 For this reason, it was natural for them to be angry
 navambar 1969 main jab congress kaa vibhaajan congress-aar or congress-o ke rup main hua to morarji desai indira gandhi kii congress-ai ke bajaae syndicate ke congress-o main chale gaye
 Then in 1975 he joined the Janata Party
 march 1977 main jab loksabhaa ke chunaav hue to janata party ko spasht bahumat praapt ho gaya
 But here also two other prime ministerial contenders were present - Chaudhary Charan Singh and Jagjivan Ram
 lekin jaiprakash narayan jo swayan kabhi congressi hua karte the, unhone king mekar kii apni sthiti kaa laabh uthaate hue morarji desai kaa samarthan kiya
 After this, on 23 March 1977, at the age of 81, Morarji Desai assumed the responsibility of the Indian Prime Minister
 inke pradhanmantritv ke aarmabhik kaal main, desh ke jin nau rajyon main congress kaa shashan tha, vahaan kii sarkaron ko bhang kar diya gaya or rajyon main nae chunaav karaaye jane kii ghoshnaa bhi kara di gai
 This was undemocratic and unconstitutional act
 janata party, indira gandhi or unki samarthit congress kaa desh se safaaya karne ko kritasankalp nazar ai
 But this act did not receive appreciation by intellectuals

 An early description of this fact has been considered by Eric H
 Erickson, but its present form differs from the arguments of Wilner, Robbins, and Barr
 quarter life chrysis ke lakshanon main ye shaamil ho sakate hai: Such restless feelings and insecurities are neither uncommon for this age nor for any age of adult life
 However, in the context of the Quarter Life Crisis, this occurs immediately after a young man - in this context, usually an educated professional - enters the "real world"
 vayask jivan main pravesh or zindagi kii jimmedaariyon se saamana hone ke baad kuch vyakti khud ko kariyar ke tehraav or ati asuraksha ke anubhav se guzarataa hua mahasoos karte hai
 The individual often realizes that the real world is harder, more competitive and less forgiving than the world of his / her imagination

 No one wants to admit to feeling like "defeated", this privacy can aggravate the problem
 jaise hi kishoravastha or college jivan ke bhaavnaatmak utaar-chadhaav shant padate hai, quarter life chrysis se grast kai log bhaawanaaon kii "neerasata" kaa anubhav karte hai
 Apart from this, difficulty in keeping pace with the work place can also be a factor contributing to the quarter life crisis
 college main professor kii apekshaayen spasht taur par di jaati hai or chaatro ko paathyakram ke dauraan apane pradarshan par jaldi-jaldi pratikriya milti rahati he

 Some students in college spend all their time working hard to graduate on time and score good marks but do not gain the "real world" experiences to get a job
 is prakaar kii kaich-22 paristhiti chaatro ke liye bahut kathin hoti he: naukari paane ke liye degree hona anivaary he lekin bina 1-2 saal ke vyavhaarik anubhav ke inhen naukari nahin mil paati he
 This sequence can be quite frustrating for new graduates
 kuch snaatakon ko, jo graduate hone ke baad sammanit naukari praapt kar lete hai, college ke dauraan naukari main aam taur par prati saptaah 15-20 ghante kaam karnaa hota he or iske kaaran ve upyukt samay prabandhan lagu kiye bina vishvidhyalay jivan ke saamaajik kaaryakramon se vanchit rah sakate hai
 Such students often aspire to romantic relationships but they do not have time to build and continue these relationships in college
 In this way, they get a job after college but the desire for a romantic partner remains and they feel unquenchable, incomplete like graduates who have a partner but no job

 Eric H
 Erickson, who proposed eight crises faced by humans during development, also proposed the existence of life crises occurring at this age
 apane vikasaatmak siddhant main unhone suzav diya ki insaan kii zindagi aath charnon main vibhajit he, prayek ke apane dwandv hai jinka samaadhaan manushya ko anivaary rup se talashna chahie

 unke anusaar kishoravastha main vaiyaktik pahchaan sthapit karne ke baad tarun vayask duusare logon ke saath gahan or aam taur par romani sambandh banane kii talash main rahete hai
 The version of the "quarter Life Crisis" proposed by Ericsson is quite different from the changes that occur in popular cultures
 darasal "quarter life chrysis" ke pop-samskruti sanskaran main us sankat ke adhik tatva sammilit hai jise arikson ne kishoravastha kii asmita banaam bhoomika-bhram se joda tha, yah is siddhant ko vishwasaneey banaata he ki beesvin sadi ke ant kaa jivan aaraam or asuraksha ke vicitra mail ke saath logon ke dhimi gati se paripakv hone kaa kaaran ban rahaa he
