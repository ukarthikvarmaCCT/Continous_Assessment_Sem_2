 Vedang is six; They are used to mean the Vedas
 vedang ye hai - The education which is given by the pronunciation of the Vedas, the correct pronunciation of the Vowels, Varnas, etc
, is 'education'
 vedon ke mantron kaa pathan pathan tathaa uccharan thik reeti se karne kii soochna is 'shiksha' se praapt hoti he
 At this time, 'panini education' is considered special in India
 swar, vyanjan ye varna hai; hrasv, deergh tathaa plut ye swar ke uccharan ke teen bhed hai
 Sublime, Anudatta and Swarit These are also differences in vocal pronunciation
 varnon ke sthaan aath hai - Gorge taluh – ichuyashaanaan taluh – Murtha - Riturashanam Murtha - dantah – lritulsanaan dantah – Ostha - Subhupamaniyan Nishtha - nasika c – bimud。nanaanaan nasika c Kantataluah - Edaito: Kantataluh - kanthoshtham – odautoh kanthoshtham – Dantostham - Vakarasya Dantostham jihvamulam – jihvamooliusy jihvamulam Nasal - nasal congestion in aath sthanon main se yathayogy reeti se, jahaan se jaisaa hona chahie vaisaa, varnochar karne kii shiksha yah panineey shiksha detii he

 The Yagya Yagadi is learned from the Srautasutra and the knowledge of the Shodash sanskars comes from the Smartasa Sutra
 vaidic karmkand main yagyon kaa bada baari vistaar miltaa he
 And the method of every yajna has to be seen from the Srautsutra
 isliye shrautasutra anek hue hai
 Similarly, the Smartsuktas also narrate sixteen rites, so they are also detailed enough
 shrautasutron main yajyayag ke sab niyam milenge or smartasutron main arthath grihyasutron main upanayan, jatakarm, vivaah, garbhaadhan, aadi shodash sanskaron kaa vidhi vidhaan rahegaa

 Nirukta explains how the word originated and derived
 isvishay par yahi mahatv kaa granth he

 antarrashtriya sambandh vibhinn deshon ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan he, saath hi saath samprabhu rajyon, antar-sarkari sanghathanon, antarrashtriya gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon or bahurashtriya companiyon kii bhoomika kaa bhi adhyayan he
 International relations is also sometimes referred to as 'international study'), although the two terms are not entirely synonymous
 saadhaaran shabdon main 'antarrashtriya raajnneeti' kaa arth he 'rajyon ke madhya raajnneeti karnaa'
 If we study the meaning of 'politics' three major elements emerge - the existence of groups; Consent between groups; And fulfill their interests by groups
 is aashay ko yadi antarrashtriya str par akalan karen to ye teen tatv mukhya rup se - rajyon kaa astitv; rajyon ke bich sangharsh; tathaa apane rashtrahiton kii purti hetu shakti kaa prayog
 Therefore, international politics is to study the actions under which states struggle on the basis of power to fulfill their national interests
 is sandarbh main rashtriya hit antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke pramukh lakshya hote hai; sangharsh iskaa disha nirdesh tay karti he; tathaa shakti is uddeshy prapti kaa pramukh saadhan mana jaataa he
 But we can consider the above definition as traditional, because today 'international politics' has been replaced by the broader concept 'international relations'
 iske antargat rajyon ke paraspar sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyogaatmak pahaluon ko bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke antargat adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, apart from 'states', many other factors have now become the subject area of international politics
 atah iske antargat aaj vyakti, sanstha, sanghathan va kai anya gaiyr-rajya ikaiyaan bhi sammilit ho gai hai
 Its present base and subject area has taken a very wide form today
 in sabhi vishyon par charchaa se pehle alag-alag vidwaanon dwaara di gai nimna paribhaashaon kii samiksha karnaa ati anivaary ho jaataa he- The scope of these definitions is very limited, because basically 'states' have been considered as factors of international politics
 yah antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop tak hi simit he
 Mainly hannes j
 Margenthau, Harald Sprout, Bon Dyk, Thompson, etc
 are its main supporters, which is clear from their definitions- naveen paribhaashaon main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vyapak swaroop antarrashtriya sambandhon kii charchaa kii gai he
 In addition to the state, new factors of international politics such as international organizations, longitude groups, ngos, international institutions, some individuals etc
 have also been included
 iske atirikt isamen sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyog tathaa raajnneeti ke saath-saath pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main ise prabhavit karne vaale arthath, saanskrithik, dharmik, saamaajik, vigyaan evam takniki aadi pahaluon kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 The following definitions of various authors reveal this meaning very clearly
 is prakaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop prarambh se vartmaan tak bahut vyapak ho jaataa he
 It has included the study of various world units and organizations along with nation states today
 parantu in sabhi parivartanon ke baad bhi in adhyayanon kaa kendra bindu aaj bhi raashtra rajya hi he
 Based on the above definitions, the following conclusions about the nature of international politics emerge
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop parivartansheel he
 Whenever the environment, factors and developments of international politics will change, changes in methods and approaches to study it are also inevitable
 iske atirikt, yah parivartan sthai na hokar nirantar he
 Along with this, it is very complex due to various factors, levels, dimensions, etc
 Therefore, a smooth, rational, comprehensive approach is required for its smooth study
 jaisaa uparyukt paribhaashaon evam swaroop se gyaat he ki antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Today its subject area has become quite extensive, under which the following things are studied: atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra aaj bahut vyapak va jatil hone ke saath-saath vikaas kii ore agrasar he
 Under this, the study of various traditional factors as well as non-traditional factors is also becoming important
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa itihaas zyada pracheen nahin he, balki yah vishay beesvin shatabdi kii upaj he
 Clearly, its history begins with the establishment of the international Woodrow Wilson Chair in Welles University in 1919

 At the same time similar arrangements were seen in other universities and institutes

 Multidimensional changes in this subject have helped to enhance, coordinate and develop the content on the one hand, and on the other hand by rendering various theories, it has helped in understanding many complex problems and aspects
 kenneth thampsan ne san 1962 ke 'rivyuu of politics' main prakashit apane lekh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke itihaas ko chaar bhaagon main baanta he, jiske aadhaar par is vishay kaa suspasht evam sunishchit adhyayan sambhav ho saktaa he
 These four stages of development can also include the fifth phase of the post-cold War era
 inkaa vistrut varnan nimna prakaar se he- Before the First World War, only scholars of history, law, political science, philosophy etc
 considered different aspects of international politics
 mukhya rup se itihaaskaar hi iskaa adhyayan rajanyik itihaas tathaa anya deshon ke saath sambandhon ke itihaas ke rup main karte the
 Under this, there was an account of the work done by diplomats and foreign ministers
 atah ise kootnithik itihaas kii sangya bhi di jaati he
 According to EH Kar, before World War I, the relation of war was understood only to the soldiers and its equivalent international politics was related to diplomats
 iske atirikt, prajatantric deshon main bhi paramparaagat rup se videsh niti ko dalgat raajnneeti se alag rakhaa jaataa tha tathaa chune hue ang bhi apane aapako videshi mantralay par ankush rakhane main asamarth mahasoos karte the
 Prior to 1919, there were several major reasons for apathy towards the subject - First, till this time it was believed that war and alliance among states were as natural as poverty and unemployment
 atah yuddh, videsh niti evam rajyon ke madhya paraspar sambandhon ko roak paanaa maanviya samarthy ke vash se baahar mana jaataa tha
 Second, before World War I, wars were not so fierce
 tritiy, sanchaar sadhano ke abhaav main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kuch gine chune rajyon tak hi simit thi
 Thus the biggest shortcoming of the study of international politics in this era was the development of general interests
 is kaal main keval rajanyik itihaas kaa varnanaatmak adhyayan maatra hi hua
 As a result, it helped to understand neither the current nor future international politics
 is yug kii maatra uplabdhi 1919 main wales vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan ke peeth kii sthapana rahi
 In the period between the two world wars, two parallel currents developed
 jinamein se pratham ke antargat purv aitihaasikta ke prati prabhutv ko chhodkar samayik ghatnaon / samasyao ke adhyayan par adhik bal diya jane laga
 Along with this, an attempt has also been made to combine historical political studies with the current political contexts
 aitihaasik prabhaav ke kam hone ke baad bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan hetu ek samgr drushtikon kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 During this period, a lot of emphasis was placed on the study of the present, but the importance of the mutual relationship between the present and the past is still not recognized
 iske atirikt, na hi yudhottar raajnneetik samasyaon ko ateet kii tulaneey samasyaon ke saath rakhkar dekhne kaa prayaas hi kiya gaya
 Perhaps this is why even in this era two fundamental deficiencies were clearly revealed
 pratham, pehle charan kii hi bhaanti is kaal main bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saarvbhaumik siddhanth kaa vikaas nahin ho sakaa
 Second, even today the study of international politics could not become more explicit and rational
 is prakaar is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan main bal dene kii sthiti main badlaav ke atirikt bahut zyada parivartan dekhne ko nahin mila tathaa na hi is vishay ke spasht rup se swatantra anushaasan banane kii pushti hui
 The third phase of the development of international politics was also a period between two world wars parallel to the second phase
 ise sudhaarwad kaa yug isliye kaha jaataa he ki isamen rajyon dwaara raashtra sangh kii sthapana ke kadhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti main sudhaar kii kalpana kii gai
 In this era, there was mainly institutional development
 is kaal ke vidwaanon, rajanyikon, rajanetaaon va chintakon kaa maananaa tha ki yadi antarrashtriya sansthaaon kaa vikaas ho jaataa he to vishwa samudaay ke sammukh upasthit yuddh va shanti kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan sambhav ho sakegaa
 For this purpose some legal and ethical approaches were structured which had the following main grounds
 inhen aadarshik evam naitik mulyon par bal dete hue antarrashtriya sanghathan kii pariklpana kii gai
 After its establishment, it was believed that the struggle to make peace between the states in international relations is over
 nai vyavastha ke antargat shakti santulan kaa koi sthaan nahin hoga
 Now the states will settle their disputes through the Union
 atah is yug main na keval yuddh va shaanti kii samasyaon kaa vivechan kiya, apitu iske doorgaami sudhaaron ke bare main bhi sochaa gaya
 Hence, the main points of the study were also to change the nature of international politics through legal problems and development of organizations
 antatah is kaal main bhavatmak, kalpanasheel va naitik sudhaarwad par adhik bal diya gaya he
 But there was always a question mark on the significance of these approaches between the World Wars
 raashtra sangh kii pratham ek dashak kii gatividhiyon se jahaan aashaa kii kiran dikhaai di, vahiin duusare dashak kii yarthathwaadee sthiti ne is dharna ko bilkul samaapt kar diya
 Non-cooperation and factionalism among the big powers gave rise to a power struggle system instead of establishing peace
 japan ne manchuriya par hamale karke jahaan shanti ko bhang kar diya vahiin italy, germany va rus ne bhi vivaadaaspad sthitiyon main na keval raashtra sangh kii sadsyta hi chodi, balki dwitiya vishwayuddh ke prarambh hone kii prakriya ko or teevr bana diya
 In this way, the world system could not run with peace, morality and law, then the realist approach was strengthened as an alternative approach due to writers like EH Kar, Shumbha, Quincy Right
 is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti main moolbhoot parivartanon se na keval isaki vishaywastu vyapak hui balki isamen bahut jatiltaayen bhi paidaa ho gai
 Changes in the nature of politics and the rise of new states during the Cold War era changed the entire international environment
 parinamswaroop naye upagamon, ayaamon, sansthaaon va pravritiyon kaa sarjan hua jinke madhyam se antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa adhyayan sunishchit ho gaya
 The failures of the ideal, institutional, ethical, legal and reformist streams of the earlier stages led to the development of new approaches
 yah nayaa upagam tha-yatharthwaad
 Although EH Karr, Schwarzenberger, Quincy Right, Shubhan etc
 developed this approach, but Hanes J
 Margenthau presented it as a general principle
 is siddhanth ke anusaar rajya hameshaa apane hiton kii purti hetu sangharshrat rahete hai
 Therefore, to understand international politics, it is very important to understand the various aspects of this power struggle
 yathartwaadee drushtikon ke saath antarrashtriya sansthaaon ke sunishchit va suspasht vikaas ke rup main antarrashtriya sanghathan kii bhi utpatti hui
 Now the form of this organization emerged as an important political organization rather than an idealistic and reformist
 iske antargat maanavjaati ko yuddh kii vibheeshikaa se bachaane ke saath-saath rajyon ke madhya sangharsh ke koun-koun se kaaran hai? vishvashanti hetu khatre ke koun-koun se kaarak hai? shanti kii sthapana kaise ho sakati he? shastron kii hode ko kaise roka ja saktaa he? aadi kai prakaar ke prashnon kaa samaadhaan dhundne ke prayaas bhi kiye gaye
 Along with the above two trends, the origin of behaviorism was also an important achievement of this era
 vyavahaaravaadi drushtikon ke madhyam se ”vyavastha siddhanth“ kii utpatti kar antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Under this approach, it is considered necessary to study three major factors for the study of states
 ye kaarak the- The main force of the above trends has been to promote the ideology of international politics
 atah is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke saarvbhaumik siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karnaa ati mahatvapurn kaary rahaa he
 As a result of this process of theory formation, many partial theories like - realism, theory of balance, communication theory, sports theory, bargaining theory, peace research approach, system theory, world order model etc
 were created
 in siddhanton ke pratipaadan ke baavjood is yug main kisi ek saarvbhaumik va saamaanya siddhanth kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 In the 1990s, Jayant Bandhopadhyay, in his book - General Theory of International Relations - has tried to overcome the shortcomings of Martin Kaplan's administrative theory, but he is still in a period of debate
 atah saiddhantikaran ke mukhya daur ke baavjood shityudh kaaleen yug apni vaicharik sankeernata va algaav ke kaaran kisi ek saamaanya siddhanth ke pratipaadan se vanchit rahaa
 In the post-cold War era, all nations started joining together under one economic system
 isiilie ab vaishvikaran, udaarikaran, mukt bazaar vyavastha aadi kaa daur prarambh ho gaya
 In this context, not only the importance of economic issues increased, but the importance of international politics also increased
 aaj rashtriyata evam antarrashtriyata kaa vibhed samaapt ho gaya iske atirikt, ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay suchi main kaaphi naveen vishyon kaa samavesh ho gaya jo rashtriya na rahakar ab maanavjaati kii samasyaon ke rup main ubhar kar aaye
 Among the major problems of the current world, terrorism, environment, depletion of ozone layer, trafficking of drugs and drugs, human rights abuses etc
, major issues have emerged which have become mandatory to solve at international level rather than at national level or regional level
 
 saiddhanthik str par bhi 1945 se 1991 tak ke saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana ke prayaas ko dhakka laga
 Priorities in this context of international politics have now changed
 uttar-aadhuniktawaad main ab saarvbhaumik siddhanton kii sarthakata par prashn chihn lag rahe hai
 The influence of historical context and ancient environment is also being denied
 ab swatantra mudde adhik mahatvapurn ho gaye hai
 Great principles have become secondary
 nae sandarbh main aanshik shodh adhik mahatvapurn ban gai he
 For example, with more emphasis on the topics of feminism, human rights, environment etc
, thinking has also started
 atah shityudhottar yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop, vishay suchi evam vishay kshetra purna rup se parivartit ho gaye hai
 Now too much emphasis is not being laid on the general theoretical establishment
 isiilie is badale hue parivesh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti mahatvapurn hi nahin, apitu swaittata kii ore agrasar prathit ho rahi he
 And there are optimistic signs for the subject's autonomy
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ne na keval antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko moolbhoot rup main prabhavit kiya apitu kai mahatvapurn muddon kii abhivyakti bhi kii
 Changes in the factors of international politics, broadening of factors, rendering of new principles etc
 Apart from many topics, the entire environment of international politics has changed itself
 jahaan ek ore saiddhanthik str par yatharthwaad va adarshavaad ke vaad-vivaad tathaa pracheen va vaigyaniktaa par vaad-vivaad ho rahaa he, vahiin duusari ore vyavhaarik str par antarrashtriya sambandh vishay ke praaroop ke bare main vivaadaaspad prashn uth rahe the ki - kya antarrashtriya sambandh ek swytt vishay he yaa nahin? yadhyapi aaj adhiktar vishvavidhyalayon main snaatak va snatakottar staron par tathaa shodh hetu yah ek swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he, tathaapi ise saamaajik vigyaan ke anya vishyon ke samakaksh manyata nahin mili he
 It has so much happened that in developed countries, it is being taught as a completely autonomous subject in many universities
 bharat jaise vikasshil deshon main bhi sudhaar hua he
 Initially here 'indian School of International Relations, New Delhi' which later on autonomously functions as the School of International Relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University
 iske atirikt kai anya vishvavidhyalayon jaise jadavapur vishvavidhyalay, kalakatta, goa vishvavidhyalay aadi main bhi ab ise swytt vishay kaa darja mila he
 Before studying international relations as an autonomous subject, it is necessary to clarify one thing that when we study the question of autonomy of this subject, 'international politics' and international relations are not considered as separate subjects
 yah isliye kiya gaya he ki donon hi vishyon ko abhi swytt anushaasan na maanakar raajnneetishastra vishay ke ek up-anushaasan ke rup main hi manyata praapt he
 Secondly, the distinction is so subtle that this subject can be resolved after authenticating the autonomy of the discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko swytt vishay maanane ke sandarbh main teen pruthak-pruthak vichaar die gaye hai jo nimna prakaar se hai - According to scholars who consider this subject as autonomous, it should be considered as an autonomous subject given the content and discipline related content of international politics

 These scholars have certified it as an autonomous subject on the following grounds: jo vidwaan antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko ek swytt vishay nahin maanate unka maananaa yah he ki is vishay main aisi koi vilakshan vastu nahin he ki ise adhyayan hetu swytt mana jaae
 He has supported his point on the basis of the following arguments- kuch vidwaan uparyukt donon prakaar kii bahes ko nirarthak maanate hai
 They believe that both of the above arguments can be better understood through the development in international politics
 atah 20veen shatabdi main, or visheshkar 1945 ke baad, ke vikaas kii samiksha ati anivaary he
 If we study deeply the question of autonomy of international politics, then it is known that two fundamental problems have to be faced in this context
 ek to antarrashtriya sambandh ke swaroop, vishaywastu va adhyayan ke tareekon main prabhavi parivartan aaye hai
 Second, at the same time, the problem has increased further due to the complexities of political science and the development of undefined boundaries
 lekin 1919 se aaj tak ke antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas par nazar daalen to spasht hota he ki isaki uplabdhiyaan ise swaittata dilaane main kaaphi sahaayak siddh hongi
 Since 1919, especially in America, many scholars have tried to make this subject more and more scientific
 iske vishay vastu, tareekon evam siddhanth ko suspasht karne ke prayaas bhi hue hai
 These authors mainly include Paul, Rines, Bern, James Bright, Hubert, Givens, Raymond Wull, Parker, Moon, Shubhan, Alford Jimene, E

 have become associated with human / human beings rather than national
 atah aaj in sabake samaadhaan hetu antarrashtriya manchon / sanghathanon kii sakriy bhagidaari aavashyak he
 Now universal theory has also been rejected from the point of view of postmodernism and more emphasis has been given on subjective and local basis

 The study of Sanskrit in the Western world began in the 17th century

 After reading inspirational commentaries about Sanskrit, many scholars from 19th century Germany, France, UK etc
 have devoted their whole life to the study and research of ancient Sanskrit literature of India

 They can be mainly divided into three classes: 1

 Mostly Christian missionary class and 3

 The people of the first class saw Indian literature in a fair and scientific way through linguistics and considered philosophical ideas inspiring
 This class mainly included August Schlegel, Friedrich Schelgal, Franz Baap, Rudolk Roth Hermann Brorvos Theodor Benfe etc

 But non-british writers made various meanings either from the Christian missionary spirit or from the lack of Vedadi chivalric knowledge or because of the ambivalence of relating Sanskrit to European languages
 ye sabhi britain kii tarah pakshpaati nahin the
 But it is obvious that all Western scholars were well aware that Vedas are the basic foundation of Indian religion, philosophy and culture, and their proper interpretation can be based on nirukta and panini grammar

 The ancient Indian tradition recognizes this style as authentic
 europe main solahavin sadi tak sanskrit sahitya ke prati koi ruchi na thi
 In the middle of the seventeenth century a German Jesuit priest named Henrith Roth came to Agra and first learned Sanskrit for missionary work and in 1662 wrote a book on Sanskrit grammar
 yahan sanskrit sahitya ke prati teevr jigyaasa or vaicharik uthkanthaa athaharaveen sadi ke ant or unnisvin sadi ke prarambh main bharat main dharmik or rajnatik kaarnon se utpann hui

 Till then, there was no system of Sanskrit education in England
 sabase pehle england main, 1811 main oxford univarsity main sanskrit bhashaa kii shiksha ke liye vyavastha kii gai
 a bitter Christian came forward for this
 vah tha karnal joseph boden jo ki east india company kii sena main bombay main leftinent-karnal rahaa tha
 This, after retiring, bequeathed all his wealth, which at the time was about twenty-five thousand pounds, to the establishment of a post of Sanskrit-professor at the University of Oxford; And the university also named it 'boden Chair of Sanskrit in gratitude
 boden chair kaa uddeshy, bharat ke gurukulon kii tarah, keval saahitiyik drushti se sanskrit bhashaa kaa padhanaa-padhaanaa nahin tha, balki britain ke rajaitik or isai mishnariyon ke dharmik hiton kii purti ke liye tha
 Colonel Boden's will, which was registered in the Court of Canterbury, UK on 15 August 1811, has its main excerpts and objectives as follows: arthath main apni samast oxford vishvavidhyalay ko daan detaa hoon
 They should use it in a university or a college, where they think it appropriate so that the people of its country can have a proper knowledge of Sanskrit language, which can help in understanding the scriptures of the indigenous people of India and their conversion to Christianity
 is prakaar 1811 main, oxford vishvavidhyalay main sanskrit chair kii sthapana ho to gai thi lekin us samay iske liye koi manachaaha vyakti na mil sakaa
 The first person to be honored on the Boden Chair was H
H
 Was Wilson
 vah bharat main medical profeshan ke ek sadsy ke rup main, 1808 main aayaa tathaa 1832 tak yahan rahaa
 During this period of his residence in India, he learned the Sanskrit language, with the hope and purpose that perhaps this language knowledge could help him to understand the Hindu scriptures and to distort when needed and convert Indians to Christianity
 is sanskrit gyaan ke aadhaar par hi vilson ko, 1832 main, oxford vishvavidhyalay main sanskrit kii boden chair kaa pratham adhishthata banaaya gaya
 Here he first wrote a book for the missionaries called The Religion and Philosophical System of the Hindus
 is pustake ke likhane ke uddeshy ke vishay main usne kahah That is, this article has been written to help those who are candidates for the prize of two hundred pounds established by Mu and who can best refute the Hindu scriptures
 1860 main, pro vilson ke nidhan ke baad, boden chair kaa doosraa adhishthata maunier williams hua
 Born in 1819 in Bombay, Mounier was a cutter Christian

 Boden, stated most explicitly in his will that the special object of his munificent bequest was to promote the translation of the Scripture in Sanskrit so as to enable his countrymen to procet'd in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion
 " "it was on this account that, when my distinguished predecessor and teacher, Professor H
 H
 Wilson, was a candidate for the Chair in 1832, his lexicographical labours were put forward as his principal claim to election
" "surely it" need not be thought surprising, if following in the footsteps of my venerated master, i have made it the chief aim of my professional life to provide facilities for the translation of the Sacred Scriptures in Sanskrit and for the promotion of a better knowledge of the religions and customs of india, as the best key to a knowledge of the religious needs of our great eastern dependency
 My very first public lecture delivered after my election in 1860 was on "the Study of Sanskrit in Relation to Missionary Work in India"
 arthath main, is tathy kii ore dhyaan aakarshith karnaa chaahoonga ki main to keval boden-chair kaa doosraa adhishthata hoon or uske sansthaapak karnal boden ne apni vasiyat main sabase adhik spashtataa ke saath likhaa he ki uski vasiyat kaa vishesh uddeshy sanskrit dharamshastron kaa anuwaad karnaa he taaki uske desh vaasi bharat ke mul nivaasiyon kaa isaiyat main dharmantarit karne ke yogya ho saken
 This is the reason when my teacher and well-known former officer Prof
 H
H
 Wilson, who was a candidate for this chair in 1832, was presented as the main contender for the post due to his writing work
 nishchay hi ise ascharyajanak na samajha jaae ki yadi mere shraddhey guruuji ke charan chinhon par chalate hue maine apane vyavsaayik jivan kaa mukhay uddeshy bharatiyon ke dharm granthon kaa angreji main bhashya karne ke liye suvidha pradaan karnaa he tathaa bharat ke dharmon or ritirivaajon kii acchhee jaankaree ko badhaava dena he
 In 1860, after being elected to the Boden Chair, in his book The Study of Sanskrit in Relation to Missionary Work in India, he stated clearly like a missionary: arthath jab hindu dharm ke majboot kilon kii deevaaron ko gheraa jayega, un par surange bichaai jaaengi or ant main isamsih ke sainikon dwaara un par dhaava bolaa jayega to isaiyat kii vijay antim or puri tarah hogi It is clear from these above that both the scholars of the Boden Chair misused their official position of Oxford University in the name of Sanskrit education for the interests of Christianity
 unhone praachyavidyaon ke shodh kii aad main apane mishanri uddeshyon kii purti ke liye lagaataar prayaas kiya
 Max Müller also worked tirelessly since 1847 to serve the purpose of the Boden Chair; Also contested to get a distorted commentary and Boden chair of the Rigveda

 In this context, the Encyclopaedia Britannica states: maxmooler ke jivan kii yah ek bahut badi niraashaa thi jiskaa uske upar bahut samay tak prabhaav rahaa
 But still he kept trying to popularize the Hindu scriptures and the conversion of Indian religious leaders to Christianity

 Ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on Earth's ecosystems
 yah insaan kii maang kii tulana, prithvi kii paristhitiki ke punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta se karata he
 It refers to the amount of biological productive land and marine area needed to reproduce and absorb the waste consumed by human populations and to make them harmless

 Mankind's total ecological footprint for 2006 was estimated to be 1

 While the term ecological footprint is widely used, its methods of measurement differ
 haalanki gananaa ke maanak ab zyada tulanaatmak or sangat parinaam dene vaale ban kar ubhar rahe hai
 The first academic publication about the ecological footprint was in 1992 by William Rees
 paristhitik padchihn kii avadharana or gananaa kii vidhi 1990-1994 main canada ke vankuvar main british colombia vishvavidhyalay main ris ke paryvekshan main methis vaikaranajel ke phd shodh prabandh main viksit kii gai
 Originally, Wackernagel and Rees called the concept "approved carrying capacity"
 is avadharana ko or sulabh banane ke liye ris ne "paristhitik padchihn" naam ko pesh kiya, jo ek computer takanisian dwaara unke nae computer ke "mej par chote padchihn" kii prashansa se prerit tha
 In early 1996, Wackernagel and Rees published the book Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing Human Impact on the Earth
 paristhitik padchihn vishleshan, prakruti par maanav maang kii tulana, jeevamandal ke sansadhano ke punarutpaada or sevaayen uplabdh karaane kii kshamta se karti he
 It does this using the prevalent technology under which it assesses the biologically productive land and sea area required by mankind to consume resources and the absorption of waste generated by them
 ek surveykshan ke ant main padchihn mulyon ko koyala, bhojan, awaas or samagriyon tathaa sevaaon ke liye vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, saath hi saath prithvi kii kul padchihn sankhya jo upbhog ke us str par vishwa kii jansankhya ko banaaye rakhane ke liye aavashyak he
 This approach can also be applied to an activity such as manufacturing a product or driving a car
 yah sansaadhan lekha, jivan chakra vishleshan ke samaan hi he jisamen urja, jaev eendhan,, nirmaan saamagree, jal or duusare sansadhano ko bhoomi ke samanyikrut maap main parivartit kiya jaataa he, jise 'vaishvik hectare' kaha jaataa he
 Per capita ecological footprint is a means to compare consumption and lifestyle and to check nature's ability to provide this consumption
 yah upkaran, koi desh apni seemaa main uplabdh chizon kaa kis had tak zyada upyog karata he yaa desh kii jivan style kis had tak vaishvik str par anukaraniya hogi iskaa pareekshan kar, rajshasan niti ko suchit kar saktaa he
 The footprint can also be a useful tool for educating people about chargeability and over-consumption aimed at improving individual behavior
 paristhitik padchihn kaa istemaal is baat par tark karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki kai vartmaan jivan sheliyaan poshneey nahin hai
 Such global comparisons clearly show irregularities in the use of resources in the early twenty-first century on this planet
 2006 main duniya bhar main ausat prati vyakti jaivik utpaadak kshetra lagbhag 1
8 vaishvik hectare prati vyakti tha
 The US footprint was 9
0 gha per capita and Switzerland's 5
6 gha per capita while China had 1
8 gha per capita
 WWF kaa daawa he ki grah par maanav padchihn jaivakshmata se 20% zyada ho gaya he
 Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the biological capacity available to the 6 billion people on Earth at that time was 1
3 hectares per capita, lower than the 1
8 global hectares published for 2006, because neither global hectares nor preliminary studies have shown Bio-productivity of marine areas was included

 ye puri arthvyavastha ke sansadhano ke upyog ke maapan or prabandhan ke liye bhi istemaal kiye ja sakate hai
 They can also be used to explore the stability of individual lifestyles, goods and services, organizations, industry sectors, neighborhoods, cities, regions and countries

 The National Accounting Committee of the Global Footprint System has also published a research agenda on how to improve this method

 Examples include how to calculate the maritime area, how to account for fossil fuels, how to account for nuclear power, what data sources were used, global numbers or localities when particular areas are taken into account When the numbers should be used, how the area of biodiversity should be included and how imports / exports should be kept accountable
