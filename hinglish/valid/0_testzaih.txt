 Silicon steel is a special type of steel that has certain magnetic properties, making it very suitable for the manufacture of electrical devices such as motors, generators, transformers, connectors, etc
 ise 'vaidyut ispaat' or 'transformar ispaat' aadi naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Its main magnetic properties are high permittivity and low hysteresis decay

 saamagree aam taur par thand main ludhaka 2 mimi moti se kam strips ke rup main nirmit he
 These strips are called laminations when stacked together to form a core
 Once assembled, they form the laminated core of the stator and rotor parts of transformers or electric motors
 Laminations can be cut to their finished shape by a punch and die, or cut in small quantities by a laser, by wire erosion or by

 Silicon significantly increases the electrical resistivity of steel, which decreases induced eddy currents and thus reduces core losses
 mangneej or aluminium 0

 Increasing the amount of silicon prevents eddy currents and narrows the hysteresis loop of the material, thus reducing core losses
 However, the grain structure hardens and metals, which adversely affects the workability of the material, especially when rolling embrittles
 When alloying, the concentration levels of carbon, sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen should be kept low, as these elements indicate the presence of carbides, sulfides, oxides and nitrides
 These compounds, even in particles as small as a micrometer in diameter, increase the hysteresis deficit while also decreasing magnetic permeability
 The presence of carbon has a more damaging effect than sulfur or oxygen

 The type of coating selected depends on the heat treatment of the laminations, whether the finished lamination will be immersed in oil and the working temperature of the finished apparatus
 Very quickly practice was to save each lamination with a layer of paper or a varnish coating, but this core's stacking factor is low and the core's maximum temperature is limited

 Aisha Bint Abu Bakr was one of the wives of Hazrat Muhammad
 islamic lekhan main, quran main mohammad kii patniyon ke vivaran ke anusaar, uskaa naam aksar "um ul mominin" "vishvaasiyon kii maa" sheershak se upsarg kiya jaataa he
 The first Khalifa of Islam was the daughter of Abu Bakr
 mohammad ke jivan or unki mrityu ke baad donon ke praarambhik islamic itihaas main aisha kii ahm bhoomika thi
 In Sunni tradition, Aisha is considered a scholar and inquisitive
 unhone mohammad ke sandesh ke failaav main yogadan diya or unki mrityu ke 44 saal baad muslim samudaay kii seva kii
 He is also known for his description of the 2210 Hadith, on matters related to Muhammad's personal life, but also on subjects such as heritage, pilgrimage and eschatology
 kavita or chikitsa samet vibhinn vishyon main unki buddhi or gyaan, al-juhari or unke chaatr urv ebn al- jubayr jaise shuruaati chamakdaar logon dwaara atyadhik prashansa kii gai thi
 His father, Abu Bakr, became the first caliph to succeed Muhammad, and was succeeded by Umar two years later
 tisare khalif uthman ke samay, aaisha ke khilaaf vipaksh main ek pramukh bhoomika thi jo unke khilaaf badi, haalanki vah yaa to unki hatya ke liye jimmedaar logon ke saath sahamat nahin thim or na hi ali kii party ke saath
 During Ali's reign, she wanted to avenge Uthman's death, which she attempted to do in the Battle of the Camel
 unhone apane oont ke peeche bhaashan or pramukh sainikon ko dekar yuddh main bhaag liya
 She lost the battle, but her involvement and determination left a lasting impression
 baad main, vah bees saal se adhik samay tak madina main chupchaap rahati thi, raajnneeti main koi hissaa nahin leti thi, ali se milakar ban gai or khalif muavia kaa virodh nahin kiya
 Most sources of traditional hadith state that Aisha was married to Muhammad at the age of six or seven, but she lived in her parents' house until the age of nine, or ten according to Ibn Hisham, when The marriage ended with Muthan, 53, in Medina
 aadhunik samay main kai vidwaanon dwaara is samayrekha ko chunauti di gai he
 Shia generally has a negative view of Aisha
 unhone oont kii ladaai main apane khalipha ke dauraan ali se ghrinaa karne or use apamaanit karne kaa aarope lagaaya, jab usne basra main ali kii sena se purushon se ladaa
 Aisha was born in late 613 or early 614
 vah umm ruman or mukka ke abu bakar kii beti thim, mohammad ke sabase bharosemand saathi do
 Aisha was the third and youngest wife of Muhammad
 koi strot aaisha ke bachapan ke varshon ke bare main zyada jaankaree nahin detaa he
 The idea of matching Aisha with Muhammad was suggested by Khwala bint Hakim
 iske baad, jubir ebn mutim ke saath aaisha ke vivaah ke sambandh main pichley samjhaute ko aam sahmati se alag kar diya gaya tha
 Abu Bakr was previously unsure "as to the propriety or legitimacy of marrying his daughter to his 'brother'"
 " british itihaaskaar wiliam montgomeri wat ne suzav diya ki mohammad ne abu bakar ke saath apane sambandhon ko majboot karne kii aashaa kii thi; sambandhon ko sudrudh karnaa aamtaur par arab samskruti main vivaah ke aadhaar ke rup main kaary karata he
 See also: Criticism of Muhammad, Islam, and Children § Marriage, and Child Marriage Aisha's age at the time of her marriage to Muhammad has been of interest since the early days of Islam, and references to her age are frequent by early historians
 sunni shaastra ke haddees ke sutron ke mutabik, aisha chah yaa saat saal kii thi jab shaadi ke saath mohammad se shaadi kar lee gai thi, jab tak vah nau yaa das saal kii umr tak nahin pahunch pai jiskaa arth he kai paryvekshakon dwaara yah ingit karne ke liye ki vah is umr main yuvavastha main pahunchi thim
 For example, Sahih al-bukhari said that Aisha heard that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and that she completed her marriage when she was nine years old, and then she lived with him for nine years
 
 sahahih al bukhari, 7:62:64 Recording Aisha's age in the Hadith collection came a few centuries after the Prophet's death, as the Hadith records of early Islam through a verified unbroken series of reliable witnesses
 is sambandh main haddees sahih sthiti ke saath sangrah se aate hai
 However, some other traditional sources disagree
 ebn hisham ne mohammad kii apni jeevani main likhaa tha ki vah samaapti par das saal kii ho sakati hai
 Ibn Hisham wrote on the basis of his biography on the lost work of Ibn Ishaq even two hundred years after Muhammad, who was born 72 years after Muhammad's death
 isha ko shaadi main nau saal kii umr main, or ebn khallikaan or ebn saad al-bagdadi donon ne samaapti par baarah ke rup main darj kiya tha, baad main unke strot hisham ebn urava 
 Child marriage was not uncommon in many places at the time, Arabs included
 yah aksar raajnneetik uddeshyon kii seva karata tha, or aaisha kii mohammad se shaadi kaa raajnneetik arth tha
 Muslim writers who calculate Aisha's age based on more detailed information about her sister Asma estimate that she was over thirteen and probably between seventeen and nineteen at the time of their marriage
 ek irani islamic vidwaan or itihaaskaar mohammad niknaam arbhahi ne aaisha kii umr nirdhaarit karne ke liye chah alag-alag drushtikon par vichaar kiya he or nishkarsh nikaala he ki vah apane kishoron ke kishoron main vyast thim
 Using Fatima's age as a reference point, Lahore Ahmadiyya movement scholar Muhammad Ali has estimated that Aisha was more than ten years old at the time of marriage and more than fifteen years old at the time of its completion
 america itihaaskaar denis spelberg ne aisha kii comarya, vivaah kii umr or umr ke dauraan islamic sahitya kii samiksha kii he jab shaadi samaapt ho gai thi or anumaan lagaaya gaya tha ki aisha ke yuvaaon ko uski comarya ke bare main koi andeh nahin chhodane ke liye atiranjit kiya gaya ho saktaa he
 Spellberg says, "aisha's age is a major pre-occupation in Ibn Saad where her marriage varies from six to seven, with nine appearing stable at the end of her marriage as her age
" " vah paigambar kii ebn hisham kii jeevani main ek apwaad bataati he, jo bataati he ki jab esha 10 saal kii thi, to is baat ke saath unki samiksha kaa saransh diya gaya ki "dulhan kii umr ke in vishisht sandarbhon main aisha kii purv-menariyal sthiti ko majboot kiya gaya he or, jaahir he, unki comarya
 They also suggest the diversity of Aisha's age in the historical record
 " praarambhik musalamaanon ne aisha ke yuvaaon ko unki comarya kaa pradarshan karne or isliye mohammad kii dulhan ke rup main unki upyuktata ke rup main mana
 This issue of her virginity was very important to those who supported Aisha's position in the debate of Muhammad's succession
 in samarthakon ne mana ki mohammad kii ekmaatr kunvaari patni ke rup main, aisha kaa divine iraadaa unke liye tha, or isliye bahes ke bare main sabase vishwasaneey
 Kandhar or Kandahar is a province in Afghanistan that lies to the south of that country

 There is a dispute as to where the name 'kandhar' came from
 kuch vidwaan ise pracheen bhartiya janapad 'gandhar' kaa parivartit rup maanate hai to kuch ke anusaar is shahar kii niv unani hamalavar sikandar mahaan ne rakhi thi or iskaa naam 'sikandriyaa' kaa bigadaa rup he
 Its name is also sometimes pronounced 'qandahar', in which note the pronunciation of the letter 'Q' as it is similar but different from the one without point
 iskaa uccharan 'qeemat' or 'qurabaani' vaale 'qa' se miltaa he
 The input method is also called an input method or input method adapter
 computer evam anya digital yuktiyon ke sandarbh main input vidhi yaa nivesh vidhi vah program he jo prachaalan tantra kaa ek bhaag hota he tathaa un varnon evam sanketon ko bhi likhane main madad karata he jo computer ke kunjeepatal par uplabdh nahin hotin
 For example, it is helpful to write something on computer in Hindi or Chinese language
 multah 'ai em i' shabd kaa prayog chini-japani-korian bhashaaon ko computer par likhane vaale prograamon ke liye kiya gaya tha
 But now its meaning has become more widespread

 In terms of economics, fiscal policy is called giving desired direction to the economy by proper regulation of revenue collection and expenditure of the government
 atah rajkoshiya niti ke do mukhya aujaar hai - kar str evam dhaanche main parivartan tathaa vibhinn madon main sarkaar dwaara vyay main parivartan
 There is no economy that can run without fiscal policy or monetary policy
 par bahes is baat kii he ki aarthik prabandhan ke liye donon main koun si niti kii bhoomika mukhya honi chahie
 The prudent use of fiscal policies, favored by government construction projects, taxation of taxes and other interventions in economic life, is seen as the driving force for economic growth
 ghate kii arthvyavastha ko yah vichaar mukhyatah kinsian arthshaastra kii dein he
 This attitude gives prominence to fiscal policies
 kinsian arthshaastra kaa bolbalaa hone se pehle maudrik niti ke zariye aarthik prabandhan karne kaa chalan tha
 In the sixties, Western economies once again leaned towards making monetary policy the main tool
 unhone kinsian drushtikon kii aalochana kii
 Proponents of monetary policy believe that tax should be reduced and monetary policy should be run under certain rules and regulations rather than being left to the discretion of the government
 keval isi tarah se arthvyavastha kaa behatar prabandhan ho saktaa he or rajkoshiya ghate ko niyantran main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In the language of economics, this idea is called Monetarism or Monetarism
 maudrik niti kaa sanchaalan mukhyatah arthvyavastha ke kendriya bank dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The bank also takes steps at the behest of the government under the fixed macroeconomic policies and also takes independent decisions from the government
 shuru main maudrik niti aam taur par keval byaaj daron main parivartan or khule bazaar ke kaamkaaj ke aadhaar par hi chalati thi
 Later, with the experience of the money market and the development of other monetary instruments, the operation of monetary policy became increasingly sophisticated
 america main governron ke fedral reserve board ne 1913 se hi arakshit mudra kii aavashyaktaaon or arthvyavastha main sakal mudra kii vruddhi kaa jimmaa sanbhaal rakhaa he
 Since 1951, the Bank of England has conducted a number of experiments in relation to monetary policy including setting rules for credit to consumers, looking at liquidity in the economy overall and controlling the monetary base
 maudrik niti nirdhaarit lakshyon ke hisaab se chalati he
 Like, how much inflation should be there, what level of interest rates would be appropriate, how to meet the macro objective of reducing unemployment, how to increase GDP, how to keep the economy stable in the long run, how to take measures of financial sector stability Go, how to maintain the stability of production and prices
 maudrikwaad ke pairokaar chaahate hai ki sarkari karch main katautee kii jaae or arthvyavastha par lage hue niyantran hathaaye jaaen
 They claim that the contingency of results can lead to instability if policy is often manipulated to achieve such important goals
 isliye aise niyam banaaye jane chahie ki sarkaar na to udhaar le sake or na hi bazaar main mani kii supplai badha sake
 These economists feel that the government and politicians should not interfere in the conduct of monetary policy
 lekin, aisa hona vyaavhaarik rup se sambhav nahin hota
 The government continues to influence this policy through the appointment of members of the Monetary Policy Committee
 sarkaar nitigat uddeshyon main tabdili karke or samshtigat nitiyon ko apane hisaab se badal kar swatantra maudrik niti ke aagrah ko panpane nahin detii
 The main proponents of monetaryism are American economist Milton Friedman and his partner Anna Schwarz
 in donon ne arthvyavastha main dhan kii maatra se sambandhit siddhanton ke aadhaar par dderghaavadhi main hone vaali mani supplai or aarthik gatividhiyon ke bich sambandh kaa adhyayan karke apane nishkarsh nikaale hai
 However, when the principles of monetaryism were implemented in American, British and other European countries, many problems were encountered
 dhanapurti ko paribhaashit karnaa bahut mushkil sabit hua
 It has been observed that the goal of money supply in the economy is repeatedly disturbed, so a new definition is needed every time
 dhan ke parisancharan or failaav kii rakrataar utani sthir or nirantar sabit nahin hui jitna pehle samajha ja rahaa tha
 Fiscal policy means what the government wants to spend from its treasury and what kind of tax it is willing to receive revenue
 isi niti ke saath sarkaar kii rin niti bhi judi hoti he taaki agar paryaapt rajasav na praapt hone kii dasha main karz ugaahe ja saken
 It is decided on the basis of fiscal policy that what percentage of national income should be raised from taxation
 isi ke saath sawaal judaa rahata he ki kam tex laga kar udhyamshiltaa ko badhaava diya jaae yaa zyaada tex laga kar lokopkaaree pariyojnaayen chalaayi jaaen jisase aamadani kaa samtamulak punarvitaran kiya ja sake
 The second concern of fiscal policy is what kind of taxes are levied
 pratyaksh kar lagaaye jaaen yaa phir bikri, maal or moolyavardhan jaise apratyaksh kar lagaae jaaen
 Indirect taxes affect the income of all people
 vah rajkoshiya niti tatasth samajhi jaati he jiske kaaran ek samooh ke upbhog duusare kii apeksha prabhavit nahin hota
 Fiscal policy varies between times of war and peace
 yuddh ke samay sena par hone vaale karch kii bharpai ke liye utane hi tex lagane ke bajaay lobh yah hota he ki rin lekar kaam chalaaya jaae
 On the other hand, if there is a lot of debt over the government, then in the peacetime, it will be seen spending money to pay off debts instead of running revenue for running philanthropic schemes
 rajkoshiya niti ke zariye budhimaan sarkarein rashtriya arthvyavastha ko sthir karne kii bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 For example, if the recession is going on, the government may decide to impose less tax and spend more
 tezi ke daur main zyaada tex lagaaye ja sakate hai or karcha kam karke saarvajanik vitt yani sarkari khazaane kii haalat sudhari ja sakati he
 Fiscal federalism is part of this policy
 iske tahat rashtriya, pradeshik or shahar ke str par alag-alag karadhaan or vyay sambandhi nitiyaan apanaayi jaati hai
