 allipur, dandepalli mandal main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke adilabadu jile kaa ek gaanv he
 To prevent the movement of speed and acceleration, the device that is attached to the main device is called resistor or brake
 yantravidya main prakritik shaktiyon ko niojit kar, icchit prakaar kii gati or twaran praapt kar, usase upyogi kaam lene se bhi adhik mahatv kaa kaam icchit samay par uchit prakaar se unki gati or twaran kaa avrodh karnaa he
 In terms of doing the right thing and also in terms of safety as per state rules, it is necessary to have brakes with each moving device
 avarohak yantra ko kriyasheel karne ke liye bhi kai prakaar kii yantric or prakritik shaktiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or in upayantron main anek prakaar kii yantric prayuktiyaan bhi kaam main laai jaati hai
 Due to these differences, the brakes are classified into the following three categories: patta brake : isamen ek lacheela patta, brake dhol par lapet kar kasne se gharshan ke kaaran gatyavrodh hota he
 Gutka brake: In this, the circular-shaped blocks are hung with the help of levers, they are brought in contact with the circumference of the wheel or drum
 aksheeya brake : jo brake pahie athwa dhol par lagane ke badale mukhya dhure athwa uske samaantar rahanevaale angon par lagaae jate hai, unhen aksheeya brake kehete hai
 Other names for these are heavy brakes, safety, automatic and mechanical brakes
 inaki rachana is prakaar kii hoti he jisase gatyavarodhak bal, dhure par padanevaale balaghurna ke anupaat se hota he, jaisaa bijli or haath se chalaae janevaale crenon main
 When the driving force of the power, or the force of the hand, suddenly becomes weak, the burden hanging from this type of brake stops there itself
 isi kaaran is brake ko swachal kehete hai, lekin yah us prakaar kaa swachal brake nahin he jaisaa railgadiyon main swat: hi lag jaataa he
 In almost all types of brakes, abrasion is caused by drums, wheels, or axles, etc
, but in engines and devices driven by the power of cylinders and pistons, if the other side of the piston is also the working medium, such as vapor, or compressed Even when air, or gas, is delivered, the speed of that device is blocked
 aisa brake gharshanhin brake kehalaata he
 Dynamic brakes are also counted in this category, for example if the electric motor that speeds the device is converted into a dynamo for a few moments, the speed of the powered device is blocked
 inkaa upyog crenon or anya prakaar ke yantron ko chalaanevaale bijli ke motaron kii raftaar ko band karne tathaa rokane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 It is mainly of two types: inamen gharshan utpann karanevaale bhaagon par niyantran vidyucchumbakon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Finally, these brakes also work by mechanical action
 ye bhi banaavat ke anusaar teen prakaar ke hote hai, yatha gutkeyukt, pattayukt or chakali yukt
 The drum drums move in any direction, with great stability by the gutka
 pattayukt brikon main gutkeyukt brikon kii apeksha shakti kam lagaani padati he, lekin iske dwaara ek hi disha main gatyavrodh hota he or duusari disha main kamjor pad jaataa he
 In a braided brake, friction knobs are rubbed with axles, which are suppressed by the force of the seams, but have to use the magnetic force of the solenoid to release them
 yah brake donon dishaao main ghoomte samay apana prabhaav daalata he or adhik vishwasaneey bhi he
 In normal use in leased brakes, only the weight of the magnet works and the magnet is pulled to release them
 khulne or band honevaale pulon ko uthaane or waapas baitaane ke liye yadi is prakaar ke brake kaa upyog kiya jaay, to pul kii sthiti badalane ke kaaran sampurna brake yantra hi tedha tirachha ho jaataa he
 In such a condition, only the weight of the magnet is unable to provide the power to hold the brakes
 at: iske saath kamanion kaa bhi upyog karnaa padataa he
 Magnets and its coils for brakes: Where direct current is used, there is a solenoid type in circular brakes, and a fixed-magnet magnet in banded and blunted brakes, but all types where there is a secondary current
 Solenoid magnets are often used in brakes
 lekin us parinalika kaa kor paratyukt bananaa hota he
 The coil current magnet can be placed in the range, or sideways, depending on the design of the controlling device
 praaia: ek hi niyantrak yantra dwaara motor or brake, donon hi ko shakti di jaati he
 Therefore, it is arranged that as soon as the driving motor is stopped powering, the brakes are automatically charged by the brakes and when the motor is revived, the brakes are automatically discharged
 aisi yojana main kundaliyaan shrenee main lagaai jaati hai
 Where alternating current is used, magnetic coils are always fitted according to the lateral current method
 parinalika brake kii kshamta sadaiv boj ko thaamne or gati mandan main prayukt honevaale balaghurna ke rup main vyakt kii jaati he
 This is taken as a fraction of the amount of force in the driving motor to carry full load while calculating, the formula is as follows: anubhav se dekha gaya he ki gatimandan ke liye, sampurna bhaarvahee balaghurna kaa yah 20 se 200% tak hota he
 Where the entire load in the crane etc
 has to be stopped in the middle, the force is to be applied from 100% to 200%
 chhapekhane ke yantron main jahaan kaagaj ke fat jane kaa dar rahata he 20 se 25% tak hi bal lagaaya jaataa he or yatayaat vaahanon main 50% tak lagaaya jaataa he
 When a side-coiled motor of a direction is stimulated, at the same time if it is driven by some other driving medium, such as the momentum of the armature or the momentum of other devices related to it, then that motor starts working as dynamo
 , Because at that time the power of the motor is unconnected to the main power source and becomes related to the controller, so that it can also inhibit the speed of the motor
 Mitigation think the way Dynamo inhibits the speed of your driver engine
 prayavartt dhara ke motaron se jab is prakaar kaa kaam liya jaataa he, tab uske taron kaa sambandh prayavartt dynamau ke samaan hi kar diya jaataa he
 Often the inductor motor is stimulated with a low voltage direction and attaches the rotor to the current controller
 aisa karne se motor kii chaal kaa niyantran dhara niyantrak main honevaale pratirodh kii maatra se thik vaise hi ho jaataa he jaisaa dishtdhaara ke prayog main hota he
 The mechanical energy exploited when the brakes of the dynamic regenerative system are returned to the stationary voltaic system instead of being destroyed in the current controller
 is pranali main disht athwa prayavartt, kisi bhi prakaar kii dhara kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Many brake systems have a mixed use of both dynamic and regenerative systems
 motargadiyon main pair se dabaakar laae janevaale vishuddh yantric brake or dravchaalit brake, donon hi prakaar ke, brikon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 It has a double cylinder instead of a cam with two pistons on either side to press the levers on the circumference of the drum
 drav daab utpaadan or pareshan karanevaala pradhan silinder ingine ke paas laga hota he, jinamein andi kaa tel or ether aadi kaa mishran puraa-puraa bharaa rahata he
 a small piston in the cylinders of the above drum is pressurized into the cylinders by the large, strong and flexible tubes, but this fluid being incompressible transmits the pressure to the cylinders in the drum, driving its pistons and friction between the levers and the circumference
 Detracts from pair ke saadhaaran dabaav se silinderon main 100 pound prati varg inch tak daab utpann hoti he or aavashyaktaa ke samay adhik jor se dabaane par 350 pound prati varg inch tak ho jaati he
 In tram trains, three types of brakes are applied by hand, compressed air and electrified
 injanon or prayek vaahan main jo brake lagaae jate hai ve sampidit vaashp, hawa, athwa nirvaat yaa hastshakti chaalit hua karte hai
 Due to compressed air and vacuum, the brakes are auto-driven, which automatically stop the train sections in all vehicles when the train's wafer connectors break or become unrelated, when the train splits
 prayek ingine or alahanda vaiganon tathaa vishesh prakaar ke sawari dibbon main haath brake to avashya hi hota he, jisase ingine kii shakti ke abhaav main, yard main unhen icchit sthaan par roak diya jaay or dhaal athwa vaayu ke jhokon ke kaaran ludhakkar ve chal na pade
 The engines and the accompanying coal and water tanks also have a handheld evaporative brake, whose brakes go into the cylinder and pressurize its piston
 isse liveron kii sahaayta se brake gutke chakkon ko pakad lete hai
 It works in the entire train including the engine
 yadi railgadee ko chalaane ke liye vaashp ingine ho, to uske boyler ke vaashp se or bijli ke ingine main motor dwaara, ek vayusampidak pump chalaaya jaataa he, jisamen ingine par lagi ek badi mukhya tank main 90 se 100 pound prati varg inch kii daab se hawa bhar di jaati he
 a small auxiliary tank is also installed in the vehicles running behind the engine, which has a space of about 12 to 15 cubic feet
 ingine railgadee main jut jane par ingine kii mukhya tank main se dabi hawa ko train pipe main chhod diya jaataa he, jo pipe kii shakhaon main se hoti hui sahaayak tank main bhar jaati he, lekin gaadi main lage brake silinderon main yah hawa keval usee samay pahunchati he jab brake lagaana aavashyak hota he
 The engine has a fill valve located close to the driver's brake controller valve, through which the air pressure of about 70 pounds per square inch is maintained in all its tanks, etc
, when the vehicle is running
 tab driver apni ichha se brake lagaana chahta he, athwa koi bigaad hone ke kaaran jab swat: hi brake lagane lagate hai, us samay train pipe kii hawa kisi na kisi maarg se, chaahe vah driver athwa guard kaa brake valve ho athwa koi anya maarg ho, vayumandal main nikalne lagati he, jisase train pipe kii hawa kii daab ghatate hi sab gadiyon main lage tripal vaalvon ke piston sarak jate hai
 This allows the pressurized air in the tanks of each vehicle to go into the brake cylinders and shrug them with the strength of their pistons, which allows the brake blocks to catch the wheels through the levers
 brikon ko chhudaane ke liye ingine kii mukhya tank main se dabi hawa phir se train pipe main bhar di jaati he, jisase usamen dabaav bad jane se tripal vaalvon ke piston apane puraane sthanon par laut aate hai
 This opens the way of air trapped in the brake cylinders to the atmosphere through triple valves and the brakes are missed
 nirvaat brake jin gadiyon main laga hota he unke prayek vaahan main ek silinder laga hota he, jisamen ek sarakta hua pola piston use do vayurodhi bhaagon main baant detaa he
 At the time when the vehicles stand idle, the piston in the cylinder is filled with ordinary air on both sides and the piston is sitting downward from its load
 gadiyon ko ingine main jot dene par, train pipon ke madhyam se un sab silinderon ko ingine main lage vayuniskaasak yantra se sambandhit kar dete hai or boyler kii vaashp kii drutgamini dhara kii sahaayta se vah yantra samgr gadiyon ke train pipe or usase sambandhit silinderon kii hawa ko chushan kriya dwaara baahar phenkakar, unamem 22 inch tak nirvathan kar detaa he
 Due to both the piston being vacuumed and even at the time of vacuum, it remains below its burden as before
 jab brake lagaana hota he, us samay driver apane valve, athwa guard apane valve, ke dwaara; athwa yatri log zanjeer khinchakar; ek chote valve dwaara train pipe main hawa ko pravisht karvaa dete hai
 With this, it reaches the underside of the pistons in the brake cylinders through the pipe branches
 uske upar kii ore jane ke raste main ek golinuma valve laga rahata he, jo hawa ke dabaav se band ho jaataa he or hawa upar na ja saconeke kaaran piston upar nirvaat bana rahata he
 Hence the air from the bottom lifts it up, allowing the pistons to catch the brakes of the brakes corresponding to the lashing
 brake ko chhudaane ke liye phir se nirvaat karne par, jab piston ke neeche ai hui hawa nikal jaati he, tab piston ke donon ore ek si daab hone ke kaaran apane bojhe se vah neeche baith jaataa he or brake chhot jate hai
 Nagla Girdhar is a village in Aliganj block of Etah district
 khagolashastra main safed bouna yaa white dwarf ek chote taare ko bolaa jaataa he jo "apkrisht electron padaarth" kaa bana ho
 In the "non-electron electron" or "electron generated matter", the electrons separate from their atoms and disperse like a gas and the nucleus floats in it
 safed boune bahut ghaney hote hai - ve prithvi ke jitne chote aakaar main suraj ke jitna dravyaman rakh sakate hai
 It is believed that the stars that do not have enough mass to become neutron stars when they run out of fuel later, they all become white dwarfs
 is nazariye se akashganga ke 97% taron ke bhagya main safed bouna ban janaa hi likhaa he
 The white dwarfs have a medium light
 vaqt ke saath-saath safed boune thande padate jate hai or vaigyanikon kii soch he ke arabon saal main ant main jaakar ve bina kisi raushnee or garmi vaale kaale boune ban jate hai
 Because our universe is only 13
7 billion years old, so far no white dwarf has passed this time so that it can become completely cold and become a black dwarf
 is vajah se aaj tak khagolashastriyon ko kabhi bhi koi kaala bouna nahin mila he

 There should be sharpness in our thoughts and actions
 aalasy, shithilataa, maleenta, niraashaa, avsaad yah andh-tamsikta ke gana hai, agni ke gunon se yah purna vipareet hai
 Just as the fire is always hot, it never cools down, similarly the warm blood must flow in our veins, our arms, keep on working, our brain works progressively, against evil and zealously in favor of good
 are
 agni main jo bhi vastu padati he, use vah apane samaan bana leti he
 We should also try to make them the same by giving our qualities, knowledge and cooperation to the nearby people
 agni ke nikat pahunchakar lakdi, koyala aadi saadhaaran vastuen bhi agni ban jaati hai, ham apni visheshtao se nikatavarti logon ko bhi vaisaa hi sadguni banane kaa praytn karen
 As long as the fire burns, it does not allow the heat to be destroyed

 vah agni kaa bhojan he
 Do not know on which day this body becomes the flame of fire, therefore, understanding the impermanence of life, hurry for the act

 Other people with similar qualities will also come near us and our family will be like that
 isaliye jaisaa vaataavaran ham apane chaaron ore dekhnaa chaahate hon, pehle swayan vaisaa banane kaa praytn karen
 Fire, like touching itself does not become dirty by touching dirty things, but also makes the contaminated things as pure as ourselves, similarly we should not be affected by the evils of others
 swayan bure na banane lagen, varan apni achchhaayiyon se unhen prabhavit karke pavitra banaaven
 Light spreads wherever the fire resides
 ham bhi brahm-agni ke upaask banakar gyaan kaa prakaash chaaron ore failaawein, agyaan ke andhkaar ko dur karen
 Every step of our life rises from darkness to move towards light

 Kavalam Madhav Panikkar was a scholar, journalist, historian, administrator and diplomat of India
 ve sardaar ke em panikkar ke naam se adhik prasiddh hai
 The name of Sardar KM Panikkar is definitely mentioned in modern diplomats of India
 panikkar china main lambe samay tak bharat ke rajdoot rahe
 He believed that the birth of diplomacy is related to the birth of modern states in Europe
 rajnay kii paribhaasha dete hue panikkar ne kaha, ”anterrashtriya raajnneeti main prayukt rajnay apane hiton ko duusare deshon se agrim rakhane kii ek kala he
 “diplomacy is an art by which the states of the world cultivate their mutual relations and serve their interests
 panikkar ke anusaar rajanyajna ”ek desh kaa duusare desh main sthit aankh or kaan he
 “A country, through its diplomats, keeps making necessary changes to its foreign policy by getting information about the events, policies and outlook of another country
 bahut se vichaarkon ne chaaturya, kushalta, kapat aadi ko rajanyik gun mana he jabaki panikkar ke anusaar dhoortta, kapat aadi se purna rajnay apane desh ke prati duusare deshon kii shubh kaamana praapt karne kii drushti se prerit hota he or kapat aadi is uddeshy ke maarg main khatarnaak saadhan he
 Good luck of another country, there can be more than four ways to achieve the goal of achievement - other countries should understand the policies of that country properly and have a sense of respect for it, that country should understand the legitimate interests of the people of other countries
 And consider it paramount and he should behave honestly
 aap bahut se logon ko sadaa ke liye dhokhe main nahin rakh sakate
 When the reality of the country's policy is revealed, the level of that country in the world society will be pushed
 panikkar kaa mat he ki vyaktigat jivan kii bhanti anterrashtriya jivan main bhi eemaandaaree sabase acchhee niti he
 Panikkar considered swearing towards the state an essential quality of a diplomat
 unheen ke shabdon main, ”rajdoot ko us niti ko kriyanvit karnaa hota he, jo uski sarkaar nirdhaarit karti he
 This may be different from his own consultations because the government of a country is familiar with the whole situation while the ambassador knows only his specific goals
 isliye jab use un anudeshon ko kriyanvit karnaa padataa he jo aadharbhoot rup se uske vichaaron ke viruddh ho to use bhaavana, pakshpaat athwa maitribhav se prabhavit nahin hona chaiye or kisi bhi sthiti main use sambandhit sarkaar ko apane netra timatimaane ke dwaara bhi yah prakat nahin karnaa chaiye ki uske swayan ke vichaar bhinn nahin he
 The ideal ambassador should not under any circumstances give a rough estimate of the behavior of his government by softening the strict instructions from his country even if the state does not like his country's foreign policy acceptor
 panikkar jo swayan ek safal rajanyigya the, striyon ke sanidhya va sampark ko rajnay kaa sahaayak maanate hai
 In 1926, French Ambassador Jules Camban wrote in an article that the connection of honorable women would be beneficial to the Ambassador

 In all countries, women are used since ancient times to increase national interest

 That girl was actually a German spy
 is clerk ko is aparaadh ke kaaran saat varsh kii sajaa mili thi
 According to Panikkar, an ideal ambassador should not be proud of his success and despair at failure
 panikkar ne rajdoot ke do mul kaaryon se sahmati vyakti kii hai- pratham, apni sarkaar ko sthaneey paristhitiyon tathaa vahaan kii nitiyon se avgat karaae rakhana
 Second is to successfully follow the orders from the country for the implementation of the foreign policy of our country
 kisi bhi rajdoot kii safalataa athwa asafalataa kaa uttardaayitv us desh kii apni videsh niti par honi chaiye, na ki rajanyik par, kyonki rajdoot videsh niti kaa nirmaan nahin karte, yah to uske videsh vibhaag kaa kaary he
 Panikkar is of the view that the most dreadful and final method of pressure behind negotiations is war

 a Hindi writer
 satvaahan pracheen bharat kaa ek rajvansh tha
 It ruled central South India from 230 BC to the second century
 yah maury vansh ke patan ke baad shaktishaalee hua tha
 They are mentioned in the 8th century BC
 ashok kii mrityu ke baad satvahanon ne khud ko swatantra ghoshit kar diya tha
 The first dynasty to carry lead coinage was the Satavahana dynasty, and that lead coin was brought from Rome
 pracheen bharat main maury vansh ke antargat pehali baar rajnatik evam saanskrithik ekta sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Later, the Satavahana dynasty carried this effort forward

 The Satavahana dynasty was established about fifty years before the defeat of the Maurya dynasty
 unka samrajya dakshin bharat kaa sabase pracheen or bada samrajya tha

 The empire was formed by the coordination of different species of Malavas, Bhojas, Pathanikas, Rathikas, Andhra, Parindas and Dravidas etc
 of North and South India and in this view the Satavahana Empire was more than that of the Mauryan Empire in the area
