 In 1920, a new municipality was established in Berlin in which all the neighboring areas were placed under one administration with a view to effective development
 is prakaar dwitiya vishwayuddh ke purv germany ke itihaas main berlin kaa vikaas charmotkarsh par rahaa
 Looking at the condition of the first city in 1945, it was seen that houses were built to stay on the western side of the city, ie people settled in this part
 uttarpashchimi bhaag main shaikshanik, vaigyanik, evam military sansthaaon kaa vikaas hua
 In the northern part the functions of the instruments were advanced
 uttar-purvi bhaag oonee saamaan ke nirmaan ke liye prasiddh hua
 The industries of rangai, furniture, metal etc
 thrived in the eastern and southeastern part, and the southern part became famous for railway industry
 rajdhani kaa saamaajik karyaalay sambandhi jivan royal pales se lekar bradenburger tor tak antarden linden par kendrit hua
 Berlin's condition deteriorated during World War II and it was severely devastated
 jaisaa upar kaha gaya he, yah kai bhaagon main vibhajit ho gaya or vibhinn shaktiyon ne isapar apana prabhutv jamaa liya
 In fact, at this time this city had become the subject of political pull
 phir bhi dwitiya vishwayuddh kii samaapti ke baad se vibhinn khandon main hote hue bhi berlin ne phir unnati karnaa prarambh kiya parantu vah apni puraani sthiti main ab bhi nahin aa sakaa he
 Looking at the traffic and conveyance in Berlin shows that there is a lot of flying in West Berlin
 ghere ke baad adhiktar videshi bhramanakari vayuyanon dwaara yahan aate jate rahe hai
 The manufactured goods of the local industries business here have been sent out by airplanes
 vaise saamanyat: rail dwaara bhi yatayaat prachlit he
 Sometimes, interruptions are interrupted by the Soviet government over certain things
 purvi kshetra se drutagami rele purvi germany tathaa madhya europe ke anya bhaagon main purv, pashchim rail yatayaat ke antargat, khub prachlit hai
 Whatever it is, it is certain that the traffic in Berlin has been very obstructive due to various political circumstances

 The people of East Berlin keep going to West Berlin every day for shoplifting

 Prior to 1945, Berlin city was the center of Germany's famous trade, insurance, banking and brokerage
 saath hi asankhya vishaal bhawanon ke karyaalay bhi rahe
 The city remained unrivaled even in the matters of industry, and it had a prominent position in Europe in making scientific equipment, electrical goods, machines, motors, textiles, aircraft, machine tools, turbines, tractors, lenses, etc
 of every kind

 avadhi hindi kshetra kii ek upbhasha he
 It is also spoken in the "awadh region" in Uttar Pradesh, Allahabad, Kaushambi, Ambedkar Nagar, Gonda, Bahraich, Shravasti and Fatehpur
 iske atirikt isaki ek shakha baghelkhand main bagheli naam se prachlit he
 The word 'awadh' is derived from "ayodhya"
 is naam kaa ek suba ke rajyakaal main tha
 Tulsidas has called Ayodhya 'avadhpuri' in his "manas"
 isi kshetra kaa purana naam 'kosal' bhi tha jisaki mahatta pracheen kaal se chali aa rahi he
 According to the language survey of philosopher Dr
 Sir "george Abraham Grierson", the total population of Awadhi speakers was 1615458 which increased to 28399552 in the 1971 census
 maujuuda samay main shodhakartaaon kaa anumaan he ki 6 karod se zyada log avadhi bolte hai
 It is completely in the 19 districts of Uttar Pradesh - Sultanpur, Amethi, Barabanki, Pratapgarh, Allahabad, Kaushambi, Fatehpur, Rae Bareli, Unnao, Lucknow, Hardoi, Sitapur, Lakhimpur Kheri, Bahraich, Shravasti, Balrampur, Gonda, Faizabad and Ambedkar Nagar
 It is spoken
 jabaki 6 jilon- jonpur, mirzapur, kanpur, shahjahanpur, basti or banda ke kuch kshetron main iskaa prayog hota he
 It is prevalent in 8 districts of neighboring country Nepal along with 2 districts of Bihar
 isi prakaar duniya ke anya deshon- morishas, trinidad evam tubago, fiji, guyana, surinam sahit austrailia, newjiland va holland main bhi lakhon kii sankhya main avadhi bolne vaale log hai
 From the point of view of formation, the sub-languages of Hindi region are divided into two classes - Western and Eastern
 avadhi purvi ke antargat he
 The second dialect of Eastern is Chhattisgarhi
 avadhi ko kabhi-kabhi baisawadi bhi kehete hai
 But Baiswadi is only a dialect of Awadhi which is spoken in Unnao, Lucknow, Rae Bareli and some parts of Fatehpur district
 tulsidas krit ramcharitamanas evam malik mohammad jaaysi krit padmavat sahit kai pramukh granth isi boli kii dein he
 Its center is Ayodhya

 This is the birthplace of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala', Pt
 Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, Ram Manohar Lohia, Kunwar Narayan
 umrao jaan, acharya narendra dev or ram prakaash dvivedi kii karmbhumi bhi yahi he
 Lokvani of Ramai Kaka was also echoed in this language
 hindi ke reetikalin kavi dwijadev ke vanshaj ayodhya kaa rajpariwaar he
 a girl from the same family was married in the Kingdom of South Korea a long time ago
 hindi ke varisht aalochak vishwanath treepathi ne avadhi bhashaa or vyakaran par mahatvapurn pustak likhi he
 Fahyan also mentions Ayodhya in his description
 aaj kii avadhi pravaas or samskruthikaran ke chalate khadi boli or angreji ke prabhaav main aa rahi he
 In the west of Awadhi lies the Bundeli and Braj of the western section, Chhattisgarhi in the south and Bhojpuri dialect in the east
 iske uttar main nepal kii tarai he jisamen tha degree aadi adivaasiyon kii bastiyaan hai jinaki bhashaa avadhi se bilkul alag he
 The variation of Awadhi from Hindi Khadiboli is mainly grammatical
 isamen karta kaarak ke parasarg "ne" kaa nitant abhaav he
 Other forms often have two forms - Harsva and long
 
 Like the standing of nouns, there are two distinctions - vikari and invariant
 avikari vibhakti main sangya kaa mul rup rahata he or vikari main bahuvachan ke liye "na" pratyay jod diya jaataa he 
 At the end of consonant nouns in the invariable form of doer and karma, in some dialects there is a praise of a "u"
 kintu nishchay hi yah purna swar nahin he or bhashavigyaani ise fusfusaahat ke swar-hrasv "i" or hrasv "e" milte hai
 Nouns often have two forms, hrasva and long
 inke atirikt avadhi kshetra ke purvi bhaag main ek or rup-dirghatar miltaa he 
 At some places in Awadhi, the form of khadiboli has disappeared; Belaia, Debia, etc
 are not available in the form of cat, box etc
 sarvnaam main khadiboli or braj ke "meraa tera" or "mero tero" rup ke liye avadhi main "mor tor" rup hai
 Apart from these, "aw" in Western Awadhi derives from "so" "jo" "" parallel to "" "J" "K"
 kriya main bhavishyakaal roopon kii prakriya khadiboli se bilkul bhinn he
 In Khadiboli, forms are often made by adding ga-ge-gay to the modern forms of ancient present
 braj main bhavishyat ke rup pracheen bhavishyatkaal ke roopon par aadhaarit hai
 
 avadhi main praaia: bhavishyat ke rup tavyat pratyyant pracheen roopon par ashrith hai 
 In the western dialects of Awadhi, only the forms of Uttam Purusha plural depend on poetical forms
 shesh braj kii tarah pracheen bhavishyat par
 But in the intermediate and eastern dialects, there has been an increase in the prevalent forms of dissimilar forms
 kriyaarthak sangya ke liye khadiboli main "naa" pratyay he or braj main "no" 
 But "B" is the suffix for it in Awadhi
 avadhi main nishtha ekvachan ke rup kaa "vaa" main ant hota he 
 In Bhojpuri, the place ending in "L" is found in its place
 avadhi kaa ek mukhya bhedak lakshan he anypurush ekvachan kii sakarmak kriya ke bhootkaal kaa rup 
 y - The forms ending in "si" are not found elsewhere except Awadhi
 avadhi kii sahaayak kriya main rup "ha", "ah" or "baati" par aadhaarit hai
 According to the above symptoms, three classes of dialects of Awadhi are considered: Western, Intermediate and Eastern
 pashchimi boli par nikatataa ke kaaran braj kaa or purvi par bhojpuri kaa prabhaav he
 Apart from these, the Bagheli dialect has its own existence
 vikaas kii drushti se avadhi kaa sthaan braj, kannauji or bhojpuri ke bich main padataa he
 Braj is definitely derived from Shaurseni and Magadhi Prakrit of Bhojpuri
 avadhi kii sthiti in donon ke bich main hone ke kaaran iskaa ardhamagadhi se nikalnaa maananaa uchit hoga
 Sadly, the oldest form of Ardhamagadhi that we find is of the fifth century AD and it is difficult to derive the form of Avadhi
 pali bhashaa main bahudhaa aise rup milte hai jinase avadhi ke roopon kaa vikaas siddh kiya ja saktaa he
 Probably these forms may have been of the ancient Ardhamagadhi
 pracheen avadhi sahitya kii do shakhaayen hai : ek bhakthikavy or duusari premakhyaan kavy
 Goswami Tulsidas's "ramcharitmanas" in Bhaktikavya is the major work of Awadhi literature
 isaki bhashaa sanskrit shabdaawalee se bhari he
 Apart from "ramcharitmanas", Tulsidas has written many other texts in Awadhi
 isi bhakthi sahitya ke antargat laldaas kaa "avadhbilas" aata he
 It was composed in the year 1700
 inke atirikt kai or bhakt kaviyon ne rambhakti vishyak granth likhe
 Among the saint poets, Baba Malukdas was also from Awadhi region
 inaki bani kaa adhikansh avadhi main he
 His disciple Baba Mathuradas's Bani is also mostly in Awadhi
 baba dharanidas yadhyapi chhapra jile ke the tathaapi unki bani avadhi main prakashit hui
 Many other saint poets have also adopted Awadhi for their sermons
 premakhyaan kavy main sarvaprasiddh granth malik mohammad jaaysi rachit "padmavat" he jisaki rachana "ramcharitamanas" se 34 varsh purv hui
 The sequence of couplets which is in "padmavat" is often found in "manas"
 premakhyaan kavy main musalmaan lekhakon ne sufi mat kaa rahasy prakat kiya he
 The tradition of this poem continued for several hundred years
 manzan kii "madhumalati", usmaan kii "chitrawali", alam kii "madhavanal kaamkandala", nurmuhammad kii "indravati" or shaikh nisaar kii "yusuf julekha" isi parampara kii rachanaayen hai
 In terms of terminology, these compositions differ from the texts of Hindu poets in that they do not have the same abundance of Sanskrit words
 pracheen avadhi sahitya main adhiktar rachanaayen deshprem, samajasudhar aadi vishyon par or mukhya rup se vyangyatmak hai
 Among the poets are Pratapnarayan Mishra, Balabhadra Dixit "padhis", Vanshidhar Shukla, Chandrabhushan Dwivedi "ramai Kaka", Guru Prasad Singh "mrigesh" and Shardaprasad "bhushundi"
 prabandh kii parampara main "ramcharitamanas" ke dhang kaa ek mahatvapurn aadhunik granth dwarikaprasad mishra kaa "krishnayan" he
 Its language and style is similar to that of "manas" and the author has written Krishnacharita, often with the same intensity and detail as Tulsidas's Ramcharit, which is written by Tulsidas
 mishra ji ne is granth kii rachana dwaara yah siddh kar diya he ki prabandh ke liye avadhi kii prakruti aaj bhi waisi hi upadey he jaisi tulsidas ke samay main thi
 Awadhi has a rich tradition of folk literature
 avadhi lok sahitya par kai shodh hue hai
 Some of them are prominent - Awadhi folk literature -da Sarojini Rohatgi saamanyat: kisi rachana ke ant main prastut kiya janevaala vah hissaa jisamen sampoorn kriti kaa saar, uskaa abhipraay or spashtikaran samavisht hon, upsanhaar kehalaata he
 Originally it was used in plays in which often the play's protagonist or a character at the end of the play made a brief statement to suit the audience's perception of the play
 shakespeare ke ekaadh naatakon main is prakaar ke upsanhaaron kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 One of the reasons for the regular behavior of this method in Ben Johnson's plays can also be said that he often planned to hide the faults of the play in front of the audience
 1660 tak aate-aate jab naatakon kii parampara kaa hraas hone laga to inkaa mahatv bahut zyada ho gaya-yahan tak ki praaia: naatakkaar athwa natyanirdeshak prasiddh kaviyon se yah bhaag likhavane lage
 This situation has been well reviewed by Dryden in his famous essay 'defense of Allegro'
 vartmaan samay ke naatakakaron ne ise itnaa mahatv nahin diya
 In current literature, it has made more use by scientists, philosophers and other thinkers in reflective and critical and interpretive essays than in plays
 kosh sahitya or vaigyanik athwa gananapradhan aalekhon main nae tathyon ko bina samoochee pustak ko badale atirikt prishthon main saamagree kaa akalan kar sakna sahaj ho gaya he
 In general, the use of epilogue is more in critical literature and penultimate or booklet is used in thesaurus or other technical literature
 chakravarti pracheen bharat kaa ek sanskrit shabd he jo duniya jeetne vaale raajaaon ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 According to Jain philosophy, there are 63 Shalakapurushas in each period, in which there are 12 Chakravartis
 rishabhdev ke putr 'bharat chakravarti' is kaal ke pehle chakravarti the
 Chakravarti has seven rattan: utak pariksha nidaan ke liye jivit praaniyon ke sharir se utak ko alag kar jo pareekshan kiya jaataa he use kehete hai
 When other methods of tumor diagnosis are not available, microscopic study of a relatively large piece of potential tissue is the best method of diagnosis
 shalya chikitsa main isaki mahatta adhik he, kyonki iske dwaara hi nidaan nishchit hota he tathaa shalya chikitsak ko aankh bandakar karne ke badale uchit upachaar karne kaa maarg mil jaataa he
 Tissue examination method depends on the type of disease and its condition in the body
 jab arbud sataha par sthit rahata he tab yah pariksha arbud ko katkar kii jaati he
 But when it lies deep, a small piece of tissue can be sucked apart by a polly needle
 yah "sui-utak-pareekshan" kehalaata he
 After separating the tissue in this way, the pathologist diagnoses it within a few minutes, by depositing it like a snow and taking a microtubule crosswise
 stavagranthi arbud jaise rogon main, nidaan kii turant aavashyaktaa hone ke kaaran, yahi vidhi upyog main laai jaati he, anyathaa saadhaarant: utak kaa sthirikaran karke or use sukhaakar mom main jamaa diya jaataa he
 After this, a vaastika is cut from it
 is ishtika ke sookshm anuprastha kaat lekar, unhen upyukt rangon se ranjit kiya jaataa he
 This method usually takes from one to three days

 uske baad us ang kii utak-pariksha hoti he
 Physicians also adopt surgical methods for tissue examination, by which a small part of the affected part of the body is cut and sent to the training
 shalya vidhi vaali utak-pariksha se gambhir bimariyon ke ilaaj main kaaphi madad milti he
 This method also helps in the treatment of cancer
 isse sharir ke cancer grasit ang se sandigdh ubhaar yaa dhabbe aadi dur kiye jate hai
 This prevents the disease from spreading
 rogavigyaani namoonay ke nirikshan main rog failane kii kshamta pahachaanata he
 It also examines other symptoms with a microscope
 in nirikshanon kii pun: jaanch hoti he jiske baad parinaam chikisak ko bheje jate hai
 Disease expansion capacity is identified by 'negative' and 'positive margin'
 sakaaratmak parinaam main koshika namoonay kii aavashyaktaa padati he par nakaaratmak main aisi aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Some physicians are against the opposition of tissue testing, as they suspect that the disease is spread by veins and lymphatic systems due to cutting of the glands, but it has been proven that the possibility of developing the disease is not usually present by tissue examination

 Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy
 bharat main krishi sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke daur se kii jaati rahi he
 After 1960, a new era came with the Green Revolution in agriculture
 san 2007 main bhartiya arthvyavastha main krishi evam sambandhit kaaryon kaa sakal gharelu utpaada main hissaa 16
6% tha
 At that time, 52% of all those working in agriculture were engaged

 According to the 2011 report, India was ranked fifth in the world, according to which it is the fastest growing livestock producer
 2008 ke ek report ne daawa kiya ki bharat kii jansankhya, chaaval or gehun kaa utpaadan karne kii kshamta se adhik teji se bad rahi he
 Other sources suggest that India can feed its growing population with Aram, as well as export rice and wheat
 bas, bharat ko apni buniyadi suvidhaon ko badhaana hoga jisase utpaadak bhi bade jaise anya desh brazil or china ne kiya
 India exported around 2 lakh metric tonnes of wheat and 21 million metric tonnes of rice in 2011 to Africa, Nepal, Bangladesh and other countries around the world

 These benefits were mainly derived from the Green Revolution, power generation, basic amenities, knowledge improvement etc
 in India
 bharat main fasal paidaavaar abhi bhi sirf 30% se 60% hi he
 Agriculture in India still holds the potential for major productivity and total production gains
 vikasshil deshon ke saamne bharat abhi bhi peeche he
 Additionally, due to poor infrastructure and unorganized retail, India experienced some of the largest food losses in the world and suffered losses as well

 In a country like India, 64% of the cultivated land depends on the monsoon
 bharat main sinchai karne kaa aarthik mahatv he - utpaadan main asthirataa ko kam karnaa, krishi utpaadakta kii unnati karnaa, monsoon par nirbharta ko kam karnaa, kheti ke antargat adhik bhoomi laana, kaam karne ke avasaron kaa srijan karnaa, bijli or parivahan kii suvidha ko badhanaa, baadh or sookhe kii rokthaam ko niyantran main karnaa

 iske kuch lakshan ye ho sakate hai- asaty vishwaas, tathaa aisi dhwani sunai dena yaa aisi chijen dikhaai dena jo saamaanya logon ko nahin sunai / dikhaai deteen
 Other symptoms are lack of uniformity in conversation, behavior different from what should be tailored to a situation
 iske alaava neend na aane kii samasya, samaaj se dur rahane kii pravriti, abhipreran kii kami, apane dainik kriyakalapon ko karne main kathinaayee aana aadi anya lakshan hai
 Both the term psychosis and dementia are indicative of paranormal mood, but where insanity is a commonly used term, which is also used legally, psychopathology is a term of medicine that has special meaning in medicine
 pagal vyakti ko praaia: apane sharir evam kaamon kii sud-budh nahin rahati
 Other people have to protect him
 atev yadi vah koi aparaadh kaa kaam kar daale, to use dand kaa bhaagi nahin mana jaataa
 Similar to, but different from, the meaning of psychosis
 manoveekshipt vyakti main saadhaaran asaamanyata se lekar bilkul paagalpan jaise vyavhaar dekhe jate hai
 Some demented people get better with just a little therapy

 is tarah manoveekshipti main paagalpan kaa samavesh hota he, parantu sabhi manoveekshipt vyaktiyon ko pagal nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 Psychiatrists have mainly considered two types of psychosis: one physiological and the other psychogenic
 inhen jaev or kriyaatmak manauveikshipti kaha jaataa he
 This deformity derives from the ancestral tradition
 kitne hi kutunbon main peedi dar peedi ise dekha jaataa he
 Sometimes it is found in the earlier generations of the father and sometimes in the mother
 kabhi kabhi turant ke pehle kii peedi main manoveekshipti nahin rahati, parantu kisi sudur purvaj main yah pai jaati he

 jis prakaar kshay rog or upadansh vanshaparamparaagat chalate rahete hai, usee prakaar sharir-janya manoveekshipti vanshaparamparaagat chalati rahati he

 jab aise vyakti ko krur vaataavaran kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, tab usamen manoveekshipti kii avasthaa utpann ho jaati he
 Psychology and cynicism have a lot in common, but there is a difference between the two
 jahaan tak unke kaaran kii baat he, donon ke kaaran ek se hote hai, parantu donon main vyavhaar kii asaadharantaya tathaa samaj bhinn bhinn maatra main hoti hai
 The special behavior of a crazy person is extraordinary
 veikshipt vyakti ke praaia: sabhi vyavhaar asaadhaaran hote hai
 He seldom comes back to normal, but the cynical man keeps running his life properly in the society
 samaaj ke duusare log use bhale hi jhakki, sanakee kahen par vah apana kaam adhiktar thik se kar letaa he

 veikshipt vyakti main yah kshamta nahin rahati
 He cannot even sustain himself in life
 dusron ko uski dekhbhaal kerani padati he
 The primary classification of psychosis has been done first in physical and psychological form, but they are also classified in the second way
 kuch manoveekshipti apane aapako bahut bada vyakti maanane lagate hai
 They sometimes get the idea that by the grace of some deity they have acquired such supernatural powers, that whatever they wish will be fulfilled
 yogic sadhana karte hue jo vyakti veikshipt ho jate hai, ve isi shrenee main aate hai
 This type of psychosis is called egoistic deranged or paranoid or paranoid

 He gets the idea that other people of the society always keep conspiring against him

 Sometimes he insists on fasting so much that he is forced into milk by putting a tube in his mouth so that he does not die
 tisare prakaar ke manoveekshipt ullas-vishaad-manoveekshipti hai

 ullas kii avasthaa main ve atyadhik chanchal ho uthte hai, idhar udhar khub daudte hai, anek logon se baat karte hai, vibhinn kaamon main haath daalate hai or khub hanste rahete hai
 Its adverse behavior is in a state of depression
 in veikshipton kii manodasha itani asaadhaaran nahin hoti ki unki chikitsa hi na ho sake
 Changing mood in mental diseases, no matter how extraordinary the mood, is beneficial for the patient
 uparyukt teen prakaar kii manodashaon se bhinn jatil manoveekshipti he, jise manovidalita kaha jaataa he
 In this mood, man has no knowledge of his personality
 uske jivan main na to ullas kaa prashn rahata he, na vishaad kaa
 Hence this mood can be called second childhood
 is manodasha main aane par rogi main apane aapako sanbhaalane kii koi shakti nahin rahati
 He is not even able to do the daily work of excrement
 bichhaavan par hi vah malmutra kar detaa he

 In clinics, they are usually treated with sleepers, or anesthetic injections
 idhar 30-40 varshon se bijli ke jhatkon dwaara inkaa upachaar kiya jane laga he
 All these types of treatments benefit some dementia, but no infallible treatment of psychosis has been discovered so far
 da frid ke kathananusaar manoveekshipti kaa manovaigyanik upachaar hona sambhav hi nahin he
 According to other psychologists, even if all kinds of other mental therapies are successful, without psychological treatment, the patient does not get permanent benefit
 atev nidra utpaadak or achetanta laanevaali oshadhiyaan tathaa bijli ke jatke manoveekshipti main sthaayee laabh nahin pahunchaate
 Even after these, psychological treatment is required

 16 oktober 1834 kii raat ko aag ke kaaran puraane westminster pales ke nasht ho jane ke baad ek nae mahal ke liye vartmaan tower ko charles bairi ke ek dizin ke bhaag ke rup main uthaaya gaya tha

 haalanki bairi pales mukhya vaastukar the, lekin unhone clock tower ke dizin ke liye ougustus pugin ko chunaa, scarisbric haul sahit yah dizin puraane pugin dizin jaisaa dikhataa tha
 The design for the Clock Tower was Pugin's last design before his insanity and death, and Pugin himself wrote about the time of the final journey by Barry to collect the picture: "I have never worked so hard in my life for Mr
 Barry Did not work, tomorrow i am going to hand over all the designs to him so that he can finish the construction of the clock tower and it is beautiful

 Diesel engine is an inhalation engine that generates fuel in the fuel using heat generated by compressing air in closed space
 is prakaar yah yah spark-jvalan injanon se bhinn he kyonki unamem vaayu or eendhan ke mishran ko prajvalit karne ke liye spark-plag kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 It is also called compression-ignition engine
 isse praapt yantric urja kaa upyog vaahan, jenerator tathaa anya kai kaaryon main laayaa jaataa he
 It was discovered by Rudolf Diesel, an engineer of German origin, born in Paris in 1892
 anya rasayanon ke alaava yah nitrogen tathaa kaalikh ke kan dahan ke utpaada ke rup main chodta he jo pradooshan kaa khatara utpann karte hai
 The air in this engine is first pressed, due to which its temperature increases
 iske baad isamen jaise hi deazal udela jaataa he yah garmi kii vajah se jalane lagata he jisaki vajah se or garmi paidaa hoti he or yah apane upar lage piston ko dhakelta he
 Due to this speed is gained which is used to do the desired work with the help of many gears and rails
 jab tak trakon, bason or rail injanon main deazal kaa prayog nahin shuru hua tab tak yah sarsaadhran ke liye agyaat hi tha
 Its other uses were equally important, but it did not seem so
 aaj deazal ingine jahaajon, janitron, pampo, sampidakon, chakkiyon, chattan dalitron, mitti hataane kii mashiinon, tractaron aadi main kaam aa rahaa he
 The size and shape of the diesel engine are different for different tasks
 deazal ingine kaa jab janya injanon, jaise bhaap tarabine, gas tarabine athwa bhaap ingine se tulana karte hai tab deazal ingine kii utkrushtataa kaa pataa lagata he
 The engine has simplicity due to compression ignition
 indhan jalaane ke liye ingine main alag se upkaran jodne kii jhanjhat nahin rahati
 This makes the heat efficiency of such engines 36 percent, while the gas efficiency of the gasoline engine is only 25 percent, only 20 percent of the gas turbine and 12 percent of the reverse steam engine
 ye aankade puure boj kii ushmadakshata ke ausat maan he
 When the load is low, the heat efficiency of an engine increases and decreases in the above mentioned engines
 san 1892 main rudolph deazal ne aantarik dahan ingine kaa patent karaayaa or inhen ke naam par iskaa naam deazal ingine padaa, yadhyapi pratham vaastavik ingine kaa nirmaan 1895 i0 main hua
 This engine was independently tested by Schözötter in Augberg in 1897 and the common display of diesel engines took place at the Munich Exhibition in 1898 AD
 san 1900 main deazal ne paris congress ke sanmukh yah ghoshnaa kii ki kaaphi prayog ke baad parichaalan chakra kaa jo antim rup usne grahan kiya, vah chaar stroke ke kism kaa ek hi aghat ke anukram se chushan, dabaav, vistaar or vikasawala tha
 The earlier diesel engines were air-injected engines and very high pressure was used to fuel the engine cylinders
 san 1910 main james mackechnik ne thos injection pranali kaa vikaas kiya, jisamen saral, unche dabaavvaala eendhan-tel pump injection ke kaam main prayukt hua
 The difference between fuel-ignition-gasoline and compression-ignition-oil engines is in the nature of the fuel
 sphuling prajvalan ingine ke corburator main gasolin or hawa bilkul mila di jaati he or ingine ke silinder main, yah samroop mishran, bhaar chaahe jitna ho, die hue anupaat se pahunchaaya jaataa he
 The air-to-fuel ratio, called the air-fuel-ratio, remains constant at 14
5: 1 in a gasoline engine
 chunki deazal main hawa or eendhanvaale tel ke milaane kaa koi atirikt kaksh nahin hota, isliye milaane kaa kaam silinder main hi puraa karnaa padataa he
 Diesel always compresses a fixed amount of air, but there may be a difference in the amount of fuel dissolved depending on the burden
 yadi boj puraa he to vayuindhan kaa anupaat 22 : 1 rahata he
 If the engine does no work then the ratio is 85: 1
 deazal ingine ko gasolin ingine kii tulana main adhik maatra main hawa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Diesel engine consumes less fuel due to air-fuel-ratio and higher compression
 jitne eendhan se gasolin motor gaadi koi kaam karti he, utane hi eendhan main deazal motor gaadi duguna kaam karegi
 Another advantage of a diesel engine is that it can burn cheaper fuel and the fuel is less likely to fire
 dijal injanon kii dizine or aakaar na to europe main or na sanyukt rajya america, main hi 20veen shatabdi kii madhya tak maanakit hue the
 Diesel manufacturers made different types of diesel engines according to their interests and ideas
 is prakaar kai aakaaro, akritiyon or kai chaalon ke ingine bane hai
 The arrangement of the cylinders consists of a rudimentary shape in rows, ie, a v shape, with rival pistons, or a common action, or two actions
 do yaa chaar chakravaale injanon main sinlendar or stabhan alag alag, yaa ek hi khand main bane rahete hai
 There is a difference in air flow due to fuel gates and valve arrangement
 deazal kaa piston trunk yaa cross head prakaar kaa adhibhaarit tathaa ant:shitit, yaa isse rahit, ho saktaa he
 Various gases as fuel, such as natural gas, irradiation gas, producer gas, blast furnace gas, or sewage gas, various types of fuel oil, filled crude oil, light crude oil, light distilled oil, or both gas and oil are used
 Can occur
 vibhinn injanon main prakshubdh yaa purvahanakaksh, vaayu yaa urja cell prayukt hote hai, yaa ve khule kaksh kism ke hote hai
 Different shapes developed as a middle road, and each builder manufactured diesel with a view to use over a wide area
 deazal injanon kaa vargeekaran kai dhang se aayaa he, par samanay vargeekaran unki chaal par aadhaarit he
 An engine that rotates 1,200 or more per minute is called a high speed engine, which rotates 500 or less per minute is called a low speed engine and an engine with a speed between these two is the middle speed engine
 ucch chaal ingine chote bore, arthath 6 inch yaa isse bhi kam maap, ke hote hai, taaki ve aakaar or shakti utpaadan main gasolin ingine ke saath pratiyogita kar saken
 The cylinder is usually arranged in rows or in v shape
 uske sahaayak ang vidyut starter, tel pump, jal pump or shitalan tantra hai, jo ingine ke abhinn ang hi hote hai
 The engine rarely has a direct patented unit
 yadi prativartan kii aavashyaktaa ho to prativarti gear alag se jod diya jaataa he
 High-speed engines often contain ventilated air or energy cells to facilitate combustion
 piston ko thandha karne ke sahaayak ang kii kadachit hi koi vyavastha rahati he
 This type of engine develops a maximum of about 30 horsepower per cylinder and uses a lighter class of diesel oil as fuel
 deazal ingine chaar stroke, yaa do stroke chakra, par parichaalit hote hai
 This means that a four stroke cycle engine requires a full four stroke of the piston, or two revolutions of the crank shaft, while a two stroke cycle engine requires only two strokes, or only one rotation of the crank shaft
 
 chaar stroke chakra ingine ke nimnlikhit kaary hai : Ingestion - The entry valve opens and draws new air into the descending piston cylinder
 sampeedan - praveshwala valve band hota he or arohi piston silinder main hi hawa ko 500 pound prati varg inch ke dabaav se dabaata he
 Strength - Fuel is injected at the end of compression stroke
 yah turant swat: prajvalit ho jaataa he or tab failata he
 The force from the spread causes the piston to disengage
 nikaas - ab nikaas valve khul jaataa he or arohi piston jali hui gaison ko silinder ke baahar nikaal detaa he
 This cycle continues again and again
 do chakra mooka-sanmarjan ingine ke parichaalan ke kram main bhi antargrahan, sampeedan, shakti or nikaas kaary hote hai
 The descending piston opens the gateway and exit points
 isse apamarjak vaayu praveshmooka se silinder main pravesh karti he or silinder ko prakshalit kar nikaasmooka se nikal jaati he
 The ascending piston covers the entry and exit holes, and compresses the air in the cylinder, increasing the pressure, to about 500 pounds per square inch
 atitpt vaayu main ab idhan kaa ant:kshep hota he
 Fuel automatically rises and propagates, causing a stroke on the piston and forcing it down
 avarohi piston ab pravesh or nikasadwaron ko khol detaa he, jisase apamarjak sampeedit vaayu ko pravesh dwaar se pravesh karti or jali hui gaison ko silinder se nikasadwar dwaara nikaal detii he
 In this way the cycle is completed
 yadi do chakra ingine adarsh ho to ek hi vistaar or chaal ke chaar chakra ingine se duguni shakti praapt hogi, par vastav main aisa adarsh ingine nahin praapt hota
 The shock of a two-cycle engine is virtually less effective due to the cylinder itself
 The advantage of a two-cycle engine compared to a four-cycle engine is that a two-cycle engine is lighter for the same power output, with fewer parts
 And the texture is much simpler
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki bade ingine saadharantaya do chakravaale or chote chote ingine chaar chakravaale banaae jate hai
 But this rule is not always followed
 suvidhanusaar ucch koti ke ingine donon hi kism ke banate he
 Tashkurgan is the capital of the Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous District of Xinjiang Province, controlled by China in Central Asia
 pakistan se paak-adhikrut kashmir ke gilgit-blatistan kshetra se aane vaale karakoram rajmarg par yah pehla mahatvapurn chini padaav he
 Situated on the outskirts of this highway, the Khunjrab Pass is on the Chinese side and Tashkur is on the Pakistani side
 'tashkurgaan ' ke naam main bindu-vaale 'qa' ke uccharan par dhyaan den - yah 'k' se zaraa bhinn he or 'qeemat' jaise shabdon main miltaa he

 2672 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 2672 BCE or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 2672 BC, the year etc

 aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad adarshavaad tathaa yatharthwaad kaa samanvay karne vaali vichaardhaara he
 Idealism and realism were the two major schools of thought in the twentieth century
 adarshavaad main satya kii avhelnaa yaa us par vijay praapt kar ke adarshavaad kii sthapana kii jaati thi
 Whereas in realism the ideal was not followed, or taken care of
 aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad main yatharth kaa chithran karte hue bhi adarsh kii sthapana par bal diya jaataa tha
 The first important indication towards this trend is that of Premchand
 unhone katha sahitya ko yathartwaadee rakhte hue bhi aadarshonmukh banane kii prerana di or swatah apane upanyaason or kahaniyon main is pravriti ko jivant rup main ankit kiya
 His novel Premashram is a similar work
