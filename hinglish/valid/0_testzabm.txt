 Spartacus was the most notable leader of the slaves in a widespread slave revolt against the Roman Empire called the Third Slave War
 spartacas ke bare main yuddh kii ghatnaon se pare zyada kuch gyaat nahin he or uplabdh aitihaasik vivaran kabhi-kabhi virodhabhasi ho jate hai or hameshaa vishwasaneey nahin ho sakate
 He was an accomplished military leader
 spartacas ke sangharsh ne 19 veen sadi ke baad se aadhunik lekhakon ke liye nae myne akhriyaar kiye hai, jise abhijaat varg ke das maalikon ke khilaaf paddalit logon dwaara apni swatantraaa hasil karne ke liye ladi gai ladaai ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The rebellion of Spartacus has proved inspiring to many modern political and literary writers, making Spartacus a folk hero in both ancient and modern cultures
 pracheen sutron kaa maananaa he ki spartacas thresian tha
 Plutarch described him as a "thracian of the nomadic section"
 appiyan kaa kahana he kii vah "janm se ek thresian tha, jo kabhi rome kaa ek sainik hua karata tha, lekin uske baad se use kaidi bana liya gaya or ek gladator ke rup main bech diya gaya
 florus ne use ek aise vyakti ke rup main varnit kiya he "jo bhaade kaa thresian sainik he or roman sena main shaamil ho jaataa he or sainik ke baad ek bhagoda or ek daaku ban jaataa he or tatpashchaat apni shakti ko dekhte hue ek gladator ban jaataa he"
 kuch lekhak, medi kii thresian janajati kaa ullekh karte hai, jo aitihaasik samay main thress ke dakshini-pashchimi kshetra par vaas karti thi
 Plutarch also writes that Spartacus' wife, a prophetess of the Medi tribe, was enslaved with him
 spartacas naam vaise kaale sagar kshetra main sakshyankit he: cimerian bosporas or ponts ke thresian rajvansh ke raja is naam ko dhaaran karte the or ek thresian "sparta" "spardacas" yaa "sparadocos", odrise ke suthes i ke pita ke bare bhi gyaat he
 According to different sources and their interpretation, Spartacus was either an assistant of the Roman army who was later enslaved or a prisoner made by the army
 spartacas ko kapua ke nazadik lentulus batiatas ke gladator skool main prashikshit kiya gaya tha
 73 BC Spartacus was part of a group of gladiators who were planning to escape
 yah shadyantr vifal ho gaya lekin kareeb 70 purushon ne rasoi ke auzaar zabt kar liye, ladaai karte hue skool se nikal gaye or gladator hathiyaaron or kavach se bhare kai vaahanon par kabza kar liya
 The escaped slaves defeated the small contingent that was sent after them
 unhone kapua ke aasapaas ke kshetron main lutpaat kii, kai anya daason ko apane dal main bhartee kiya or antat visuviyas parvat par ek adhik surakshatmak sthiti main deraa jamaaya
 The Gladiators who fled after being freed chose Spartacus and two French slaves - Crixus and Onomouse - as their leaders
 haalanki roman lekhakon kaa anumaan he ki ye das sajaateey samooh ke the jinka netaa spartacas tha or ho saktaa he unhone daason ke swatahpravartit sanghathan par sainya netritv kii apni swayan kii padanukramik vyavastha lagu kii hogi, tathaa anya das netaaon ko adhinsth padon par rakhaa hoga
 The positions of Crixus and Onomouse - and later, Castus - could not be clearly determined by the sources
 rome kii pratikriya roman fuj kii gaiyr-maujuudagi ke kaaran baadhit hui, jo spain main vidroh or tritiy mithridatic yuddh main pehle se hi fansi hui thi
 In addition, Rome considered this rebellion to be a police case rather than a war
 Rome sent a civilian army under the command of Prater Gaius Claudius Glaberus, who surrounded the slaves on the mountain, anticipating that the slaves would surrender, forced by starvation
 unhen us vakt kaaphi aashcharya hua jab unhone dekha ki spartacas ke paas daakhaltaaon se bani rassiyaan hai, jisaki madad se vah apane saathiyon ke saath jwalamukhi vaale chattan kii ore se neeche utraa or asurakshit roman shivi par hamalaa bol diya or unamem se zyaadaatar ko maar diya
 The slaves also defeated the second expedition and almost caught the prater commander, killing his ally and capturing military equipment
 in safaltaaon ke saath, ek baad ek das spartkan sena main shaamil hone lage or saath main "us kshetra ke kai gaderiyon or charavaahon ne bhi aisa hi kiya or unki kul sankhya badhkar 70,000 ho gayi
 Spartacus proved to be an excellent tactician in these skirmishes, which meant that he had prior military experience
 haalanki daason ke paas sainya prashikshan kaa abhaav tha, unhone anushaasit roman senaaon ke saath saamana hone par uplabdh sthaneey saamagree ke kushal upyog or asaamaanya ranneeti kaa pradarshan kiya
 He founded 73-72 BC
 During the winter, the newly incorporated slaves were provided training, weapons and new implements and expanded their guerrilla areas to include the cities of Nola, Nuseria, Thuri and Metapontam
 in sthanon ke bich kii duuri or baad kii ghatnaon se pataa chalata he ki das do samoohon main kaary karte the jiskaa netritv spartacas or cricksus ke alawa anya netaa karte the
 72 BC In the spring of, the slaves left their winter bases and moved north
 At the same time, the Roman Senate, concerned with the defeat of the Prater army, sent a pair of magistrates under the command of Lucius Gellius Publicola and Naus Cornelius Lentulus Clodienus
 These two contingents were initially successful - defeating 30,000 slaves commanding Crixus and Mount Gergenus - but then losing to Spartacus
 in paraajayon ko appiyan or plutark dwaara yuddh ke do sabase vyapak itihaas main vibhinn tareekon se darshaya gaya he
 Concerned by this growing rebellion, the Senate engaged Marcus Licinius Crassus, the richest man in Rome and the only one who came forward to end the rebellion
 krasss ke jimme aath tukadiyon ko saunpa gaya, lagbhag 40,000-50,000 prashikshit roman sainik, jinke upar usne kathor, yahaan tak ki krur anushaasan lagu kiya or ikai vinaash kii sazaa ko punerjeevit kiya
 When Spartacus and his followers, who retreated to the south of Italy for unclear reasons, arrived in 71 BC
 At the start of the northward movement again, Crassus stationed six of his troops on the borders of that area and with two of his messenger Mumius's troops to surround Spartacus from behind
 haalanki mumius ko daason ke saath ulajhane se manaa kiya gaya tha, usne lagbhag sahi avasar par hamalaa kiya, lekin haar gaya
 Subsequently, Crassus's troops were victorious on several fronts and pushed Spartacus south to Lusania

 According to Plutarch, Spartacus made a deal with the pirates of Cilicia to deliver him and his 2000 comrades to Sicily where he intended to provoke a slave rebellion and get help
 haalanki, use daakuon dwaara dhokhaa de diya gaya, jinhone usase bhugtan le liya or phir chhod kar chale gaye
 Some sources mention that the rebels attempted to build fleets and ships to escape there, but Crassus took unspecified measures to ensure that the rebels could not reach Sicily and had to give up their efforts
 Spartacus's army then moved towards the Regium
 The Troop of Crassus followed and upon reaching there made fortifications on the grounds of the Isthmus in the Regium, despite the raids of the rebel slaves
 vidrohiyon ko ghere liya gaya or unki aapurti kaat di gai
 By this time Pompeo's contingent had returned to Spain and received a Senate order to travel south to assist Crassus
 jabaki krasss ko ashanka thi ki pompe ke aagaman se use is kaam kaa shrey lene main mushkil hogi, spartacas ne krasss ke saath ek samjhaute ko anjaam dene kii koshish kii lekin asafal rahaa
 When Crassus refused, a part of Spartacus's army fled into the mountains on the west side of Patelia in Brutium and was followed by Crassus's army
 jab tukdi ne mukhya sena se alag hue vidrohiyon ke ek hisse ko gher liya to spartacas ke balon ke bich anushaasan tut gaya or chote-chote samoohon ne aane vaali tukdi par swatantra rup se hamalaa karnaa shuru kar diya
 Spartacus now dispersed his army and landed his entire force against the military for the last time in which the slaves were completely wiped out and most of their parts were killed in the battlefield
 khud spartacas kaa kya hua yah agyaat he, kyonki uskaa sharir nahin mila, lekin itihaaskaaron kaa kahana he ki vah bhi apane saathiyon ke saath ladaai main maaraa gaya
 Six thousand slaves held captive by the army of Crassus were crucified on the Appian route from Rome to Kapua
 shastreey itihaaskaar is baat par vibhajit hai ki spartacas kii manshaa kya thi
 While Plutarch writes that Spartacus only wanted to flee north to Cisalpine Gaul and send his comrades to his house, Appian and Flores write that he himself intended to occupy Rome
 appiyan kaa yah bhi kahana he ki usne baad main is lakshya ko chhod diya, jo roman bhay ko hi pratibimbit karata he
 None of Spartacus' actions indicated that he wanted to reform Roman society or abolish slavery, as depicted in many fictional descriptions, for example in the 1960 film Spartacus

 dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan bharat ke pratham up-raashtrapati or dwitiya raashtrapati rahe
 He was a pioneer of Indian culture, an eminent educationist, a great philosopher and a devout Hindu thinker

 dow radhakrishnan kaa janm tamilnadu ke tirutani gram main, jo tatkaaleen madras se lagbhag 64 ki me kii duuri par sthit he, 5 sitambar 1888 ko hua tha
 The family he was born into was a Brahmin family
 unka janm sthaan bhi ek pavitra tirthasthal ke rup main vikhyath rahaa he
 Radhakrishnan's ancestors had previously lived in a village called 'sarvepalli' and in the mid-18th century they had migrated towards the village of Tirutani
 lekin unke purakhe chaahate the ki unke naam ke saath unke janmasthal ke gram kaa bodh bhi sadaiv rahanaa chaiye
 That is why his family started wearing 'sarvapalli' before his name
 dow radhakrishnan ek garib kintu vidwaan brahman kii santaan the
 His father's name was 'sarvepalli Veeraswamy' and mother's name was 'sitamma'
 unke pita rajasav vibhaag main kaam karte the
 He was responsible for the maintenance of a very large family
 veeraswami ke paanch putr tathaa ek putree thi
 Radhakrishnan's place was second among these descendants
 unke pita kaafii kathinaayee ke saath parivaar kaa nirvahan kar rahe the
 Due to this, the child Radhakrishnan did not get any special pleasure in childhood
 radhakrishnan kaa balykaal tirutani evam tirupati jaise dharmik sthalon par hi vyateet hua
 He spent the first eight years in Tirutani
 yadhyapi unke pita puraane vichaaron ke the or unamem dharmik bhavanaayen bhi thim, iske baavjood unhone radhakrishnan ko chrishchiyan mishanri sanstha luthern mishan skool, tirupati main 1896-1900 ke madhya vidyadhyayan ke liye bheja
 Then for the next 4 years he was educated in Vellore
 iske baad unhone madras chrishchiyan college, madras main shiksha praapt kii
 He was brilliant since childhood
 in 12 varshon ke adhyayan kaal main radhakrishnan ne bible ke mahatvapurn ansh bhi yaad kar liye
 For this, he was awarded the honor of special merit
 is umr main unhone vir saavarkar or swami vivekananda kaa bhi adhyayan kiya
 He passed the matriculation level examination in 1902 and also received a scholarship
 iske baad unhone 1904 main kala sankaay pariksha pratham shrenee main uteern kii
 He also received special merit remarks in psychology, history and mathematics due to his high scores
 iske alaava chrishchiyan college, madras ne unhen chaatravrutti bhi di
 After doing his MA in Philosophy in 1916, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Madras Residency College
 baad main usee college main ve praadhyaapak bhi rahe
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan introduced the Indian philosophy to the world through his writings and speeches
 saare vishwa main unke lekhon kii prashansa kii gayi
 At that time, in the Brahmin families of Madras, marriage was completed at an early age and Radhakrishnan was no exception
 1903 main 16 varsh kii aayu main hi unka vivaah dur ke rishte kii bahan 'sivaakamu' ke saath sampann ho gaya
 At that time his wife was only 10 years old
 atah teen varsh baad hi unki patni ne unke saath rahanaa armbh kiya
 Although his wife Sivakamu was not traditionally educated, he had good authority over the Telugu language
 vah angrezi bhashaa bhi likh-pard sakati thim
 In 1908, the Radhakrishnan couple received a daughter as a child
 1908 main hi unhone kala snaatak kii oopaadhi pratham shrenee main praapt kii or darshan shaastra main vishisht yogyata praapt kii
 In 1909, after six years of marriage, he also passed the postgraduate examination in Arts
 inkaa vishay darshan shaastra hi rahaa
 He also continued to teach tuition to children for his personal income during higher studies
 1908 main unhone em0 e0 kii oopaadhi praapt karne ke liye ek shodh lekh bhi likhaa
 At this time, he was only twenty years old
 isse shastron ke prati unki gyaan-pipaasa badi
 Soon he also studied Vedas and Upanishads deeply
 iske atirikt unhone hindi or sanskrit bhashaa kaa bhi ruchipurvak adhyayan kiya
 While education definitely has an impact on every individual, the quality of an educational institution also leaves an impact
 chrishchiyan sansthaaon dwaara us samay pashchimi jivan mulyon ko vidhyaarthiyon ke bheetar kaaphi gaharaai tak sthapit kiya jaataa tha
 This is the reason that while studying in Christian institutions, Radhakrishnan's life had high qualities
 lekin unamem ek anya parivartan bhi aayaa jo ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon ke kaaran hi tha
 Some people used to view Hindutva ideas and criticize them
 unki aalochana ko dow radhakrishnan ne chunauti kii tarah liya or hindu shastron kaa gaharaa adhyayan karnaa armbh kar diya
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan wanted to know that in which culture ideas really are conscious and in which culture ideas are rooted? Then by natural intuition started to believe strongly that the poor and illiterate people living in remote places of India also knew the ancient truth
 is kaaran radhakrishnan ne tulanaatmak rup se yah jaan liya ki bhartiya aadhyatm kaafii samrudh he or chrishchiyan mishnariyon dwaara hindutv kii aalochanaayen niraadhaar hai
 From this he concluded that Indian culture is based on religion, knowledge and truth which gives the true message of life to the creature
 dow radhakrishnan ne yah bhalee bhanti jaan liya tha ki jivan bahut hi chota he parantu isamen vyaapt khushiyaan anishchit hai
 For this reason, a person should live happily and comfortably
 vastutah mrityu ek atal sachai he, jo amir garib sabhi ko apana grass banaati he tathaa kisi prakaar kaa varg bhed nahin karti
 True knowledge is the only one who can eliminate the ignorance inside you
 sadgipurn santoshavritti kaa jivan amiron ke ahamkaari jivan se behatar he, jinamein asantosh kaa nivas he
 a quiet mind is better than those thunderous applause; Which are heard in parliaments and courts
 vastut: isi kaaran dow radhakrishnan bhartiya samskruti ke naitik mulyon ko samaj paane main safal rahe, kyonki ve mishnariyon dwaara kii gai aalochanaon ke satya ko swayan parakhnaa chaahate the
 That is why criticisms are said to be acts of purification
 sabhi matayen apane bacchon main ucch sanskaar dekhnaa chaahati hai
 For this reason, they teach children how to believe in God, stay away from sin and help those who are in trouble
 dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah bhi janaa ki bhartiya samskruti main sabhi dharmon kaa aadar karnaa sikhaaya gaya he or sabhi dharmon ke liye samta kaa bhav bhi hindu samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan he
 Thus he understood the specific identity of Indian culture and became very close to it
 dow radhakrishnan samooche vishwa ko ek vidhyalay maanate the
 He believed that only through education can the human mind be properly utilized
 at: vishwa ko ek hi ikai maanakar shiksha kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 In his speech at the University of Edinburgh, UK, Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had said - "man should be one
 maanav itihaas kaa sampurna lakshya maanav jati kii mukti tabhi sambhav he jab deshon kii nitiyon kaa aadhaar puure vishwa main shaanti kii sthapana kaa praytn ho
 "dr
 Radhakrishnan used to enchant the students with his wit-filled explanations, joyful expressions and mildly tickling stories
 ucch naitik mulyon ko apane aacharan main utaarne kii prerana vah apane chaatro ko bhi dete the
 Whatever subject he taught, he himself studied it deeply
 darshan jaise gambheer vishay ko bhi vah apni style se saral, rochak or priy bana dete the
 In 1909, at the age of 21, Dr
 Radhakrishnan started teaching philosophy as a junior lecturer in Madras Presidency College
 yah unka param saubhaahgya tha ki unako apni prakruti ke anukool aajeevika praapt hui thi
 Here he not only did teaching work for 7 years but also studied Indian philosophy and Indian religion deeply
 un dinon vyaakhyaata ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki adhyaapan hetu vah shikshan kaa prashikshan bhi praapt kare
 That is why in 1910 Radhakrishnan started taking training in Madras
 is samay inkaa vetan maatr 37 rupee tha
 Radhakrishnan, the then Professor of Philosophy Department, was greatly overwhelmed by the philosophy of classical knowledge
 unhone unhen darshan shaastra kii kakshaon se anupasthit rahane kii anumati pradaan kar di
 But instead, it was conditioned that he should teach in philosophy classes instead
 tab radhakrishna ne apane kaksha saathiyon ko teraa aise prabhaavshaalee vyaakhyaan diye, jinase ve shikshaarthi bhi chakit rah gayi
 The reason for this was that he had a deep grip on the subject, his approach to philosophy was clear and he had also chosen the appropriate words while giving lectures
 1912 main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan kii "manovigyaan ke aavashyak tatv" sheershak se ek laghu pustika bhi prakashit hui jo kaksha main diye gayi unke vyakhyanon kaa sangrah tha
 This qualification was proved by this booklet that "not only do they have a rich store of words to explain every verse, their memory power is also very unique
 " When Dr
 Radhakrishnan returned to India from Europe and America, then various universities here honored him by awarding him honorary degrees
 1928 kii sheet ritu main inaki pratham mulaaqaat pandit jawahar laal nehru se us samay hui, jab vah congress party ke vaarshik adhiveshan main sammilit hone ke liye kalakatta aae hue the
 Although Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan could not participate in any political discourse as a member of the Indian Educational Service, he did not care for this taboo and gave a speech
 1929 main inhen vyaakhyaan dene hetu 'maanchester vishvavidhyalay' dwaara aamantrit kiya gaya
 He gave many lectures in Manchester and London
 inaki shiksha sambandhi uplabdhiyon ke daayre main nimnavat sansthanik seva kaaryon ko dekha jaataa he- Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan did the same and put his address to rest at 12 o'clock at night
 pandit nehru or radhakrishnan ke alaava kisi anya ko isaki jaankaree nahin thi
 After independence, he was requested to fulfill diplomatic work with the Soviet Union as a distinguished ambassador to serve the motherland
 is prakaar vijayalakshmi pandit kaa inhen nayaa uttaradhikari chunaa gaya
 Pandit Nehru's selection prompted many to wonder why a philosopher was chosen for diplomatic services? He suspected that the abilities of Dr
 Radhakrishnan were not compatible with the responsibility assigned to him
 lekin baad main sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne yah sabit kar diya ki moscow main niyukt bhartiya rajanyikon main ve sabase behatar the
 He was a non-traditional diplomat
 jo mantranaayen der raatri hoti thim, ve unamem raatri 10 baje tak hi bhaag lete the, kyonki uske baad unke shayan kaa samay ho jaataa tha
 Even when Radhakrishnan was a teacher, he was not bound by rules
 kaksha main yah 20 minute deree se aate the or das minute purv hi chale jate the
 They said that the lectures they had to give in class were completed in enough time of 20 minutes
 iske uparant bhi yah vidhyaarthiyon ke priy evam aadarneey shikshak bane rahe
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan was elected Vice President after his arrival from the Soviet Union in 1952
 samvidhan ke antargat uparashtrapati kaa nayaa pad srujit kiya gaya tha
 Nehru again surprised the people by choosing Radhakrishnan for this post
 unhen aashcharya tha ki is pad ke liye congress party ke kisi raajnneetijna kaa chunaav kyon nahin kiya gaya
 Radhakrishnan also served as the Speaker in the Rajya Sabha as Vice President
 san 1952 main ve bharat ke uparashtrapati banaaye gayi
 Later this selection of Pandit Nehru also proved to be meaningful, because a non-politician as Vice President influenced all politicians
 sansad ke sabhi sadasyon ne unhen unke kaary vyavhaar ke liye kaafii saraahaa
 People still remember his generosity, perseverance and humorous nature
 hamaare desh ke dwitiya kintu adwitiya raashtrapati dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ke janm din ko prativarsh 'shikshak diwas' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 On this day, awards are also given to the best teachers in the entire country by the Government of India

jpg The Neolithic Age, period, or period, or Neolithic Age was a period of development of human technology that began in the Middle East in 9500 BC

 The Neolithic is not a specific chronological period, but rather a set of practical and cultural characteristics that include the use of wild and domestic crops and the use of domesticated animals

 Neolithic culture began in the Levant around 9,500 BC until those findings were adopted within the archaeological community
 Is believed to be around
 kshetra main iskaa vikaas sidhe apipeleolithik nachufin samskruti se hua tha jiske logon ne junglee anaajon ke istemaal kaa maarg prashast kiya jo baad main sahi myne main krishi ke rup main viksit hua
 Thus the Natufians can be called "proto-neolithic"

 Not all cultural element features of the Neolithic appeared in the same order everywhere: utensils were not used in early peasant society in the Near East and in Britain it has been unclear to what extent plants were used in the early Neolithic period Whether or not permanently inhabited communities existed
 Independent civilization programs in other parts of the world, such as Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia, resulted in their own region-specific Neolithic cultures that were completely different from cultures in Europe and Southwest Asia

 Unlike the Paleolithic where more than one human society existed, only one human species managed to reach the Neolithic

 The earliest mention of the effort to make steam engines is found in the writings of the Hero of Alexandria
 hero us vikhyath alaxandreey sampradaay schwör bei koranka sadsy tha jisamen tolemi, euclid, iretosthanij jaise tatkaaleen vigyaan ke maharathi sammilit the
 In his article, Hero describes a device in which air was heated in a closed box and circulated down a pipe passage to a water-filled vessel
 isamen bartan kaa pani duusari nalee main chadhataa tha or ek nakli phuhaaraa ban jaataa tha
 Then after this, no details are found in this regard
 1606 i

 He also suggested that in order to fill a vessel with water, it should be connected to a pond with water by a tube and then after filling steam in that vessel and then cooling it with water from above, the inner steam condensed Vacuum will generate and instead the water from the pond will be filled in the vessel
 1698 i
 main marxev dela porta ke is suzav kaa upyog tamas severy ne pani chadhaane kii ek mashin main kiya
 Thus Savory was the first person to create a steam engine for commercial use, which was used to pump water from the mines and to drain water from the wells
 severy ke ingine ke avishkaar ke baad bhaap ingine kaa aglaa charan newcomen ingine kaa avishkaar tha
 It was invented by Thomas Newcomen
 is ingine kaa khadaanon or kuon se pani nikaalane main 50 varshon tak upyog hota rahaa
 It also has historical significance, because this opened the way for James Watt's inventions
 is ingine main pehali baar silinder or piston kaa upyog kiya gaya jo ab tak bhaap injanon main prayukt kiye jate hai
 Steam in the newcomen engine is only used to generate vacuum
 piston uthaane kaa kaam, jisase pani chadhataa he, vayumandaleey daab karata he
 But it only takes a lot of fuel waste to condense the steam
 james wat kaa mahatvapurn kaary bhaap ingine ko sarvshereshth rup dena he jisase manushya kii shakti das guni bad gai or vyavsaayik kshetra main brihad parivartan ho gaya
 James Watt was a clever scientific engineer in Glasgow and in 1763 he was ordered by a physics professor at the University of Glasgow to repair a Newcomen engine that never ran well
 marammat karke samay wat ko dhyaan aayaa ki isamen eendhan buree tarah se vyarth ho jaataa he
 Watt of thoughtful nature started the idea of making the best machine from it
 is prakaar unhone anek anveshan kiye or yantra banaae, jinase bhaap ingine ko uskaa vartmaan swaroop praapt hua or vah udyog or sabhyataa kii pragati main shaktishaalee saadhan bana
 The following are the main types of steam engines: ekakriya ingine main bhaap piston ke ek hi ore kaary karti he evam dvikriya ingine main bhaap piston ke donon ore kaary karti he
 If both these types of engines have the same condition in all other states, the power received by the two-way engine is twice the power received by the other type of engine
 yahi kaaran he ki in dinon ekakriya ingine kam hi vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he
 The engine is called vertical or horizontal according to whether the cylinder's axis is vertical or horizontal
 kshaitij ingine urdhwadhar ingine se adhik jagah gherta he
 The vertical type engine has less friction etc
, due to which it can run for more days than horizontal engine
 bhaap ingine kii chaal vastut: iske crank shift parikraman prati minute kii chaal hoti he
 The average piston speed in an engine with four foot piston stroke and 80 revolutions per minute would be 640 feet per minute
 yah ingine nimna chaal ingine kaha jayega
 Generally, an engine running at a speed of less than 100 revolutions per minute is called a low speed engine and an engine running at a speed of more than 250 revolutions per minute is called a high speed engine
 100 or 250 parikraman prati minute ke bich kii chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko "madhyam chaal ingine" kehete hai
 The greatest quality of a high speed engine is that it is of very small size for equal power
 ucch chaal ke kaaran bhaap bhi kam hi kharch hoti he, kyonki is prakaar ke ingine main bhaap or silinder ke bich ooshmaa sthanantaran main bahut hi kam samay lagata he
 The compaction engine is a steam engine from which steam is extracted directly into the atmosphere and for this the pressure of steam in the cylinder should never be lower than the pressure of the atmosphere
 sanghanan ingine main bhaap kaary karne ke baad sanghnitr main pravesh karti he evam vah vahaan vayumandal kii daab par jal main parivartit ho jaati he
 The behavior of the condenser allows steam to function more
 saral ingine main prayek silinder boyler se sidhe bhaap paata he evam sidhe vayumandal yaa sanghnitr main nikaas karata he
 In a combustion engine, steam is transmitted to a lesser extent in a cylinder called a high pressure cylinder, and then to a larger cylinder, called a low pressure cylinder, and the propagation is complete here
 bahudhaa nimna daab silinder sanghnitr main nikaas karata he
 Propagation can also take place in three or four cylinders and these engines are called triprasar engines or tetraspara engines
 ooshmaa ingine kii adhiktam dakshata / T1 hoti he jisamen T1 or T2 ooshmaa ingine chakra main adhiktam evam nunatam taap hai
 This suggests that the efficiency of the engine depends on both these temperatures
 bhaanp ingine kii dakshata utani hi badhati jaaegi jitani kaa mulya badhegaa evam kaa mulya ghatega
 To increase the value of steam, the pressure of steam coming into the engine from the boiler has to be increased, because the higher the pressure of steam, the higher the value
 ko badhaane kaa ek or upaay he
 That is superheating the steam
 atitapak kaa boyler main vyavhaar karke bhaap kaa adhitaap badhaayaa jaataa he
 To reduce the value of K, it becomes necessary to behave the condenser
 sanghnitr main thande jal dwaara bhaap jal main parivartit kii jaati he
 Therefore, the value of a good condenser can be equal to the temperature of cold water
 isse pataa chalata he ki bhaap ingine main adhik daab evam atitpt bhaap dwaara kaary karaane se evam kaary karaane ke baad bhaap ko sanghnitr main prapya thande jal ke taap ke baraabar taap par jal main parivartit karne se ingine adhik daksh hoga
 Steam from the boiler enters the steambox at high pressure
 piston jaise hi stroke ke ant main pahunchataa he, usee samay valve chalata he, jisamen bhapadwar khul jaataa he evam bhaap silinder main pravesh karti he
 The piston moves when pushed by steam pressure
 ise agr stroke kehete hai
 The crank, crank shaft and centrifuge move by piston movement
 utkendrak ke chalane se dwaar kuch or adhik khul jaataa he
 Steam continues to enter the cylinder until the door is closed
 is samay viched hota he evam iske baad silinder main bhaap kaa sambharan nahi ho paata
 The steam in the cylinder is now transmitted and in this expansion the volume of steam increases and the pressure decreases
 isi prakaar ke samay bhaap kaary karti he
 At the end of the front stroke, the valve opens the steam side towards the exhaust, releasing the steam
 nikali hui bhaap kii daab pasch daab ke baraabar ho jaati he
 After a few moments of release, the piston returns backward and is called the alternating stroke
 is stroke main lautate samay piston silinder main bachi hui bhaap kaa nikaas karata jaataa he
 When the piston reaches the end of this stroke, the valve closes the exhaust gate, stopping the flow of steam
 silinder sheersh or piston ke bich kuch bhaap batch jaati he, jo nirmukt nahin ho paati he
 Then the cycle is repeated
 dvikriya ingine main isi se sadrush chakra kii kriya silinder kii duusari ore hoti he
 The Rankin cycle is a theoretical cycle according to which the steam engine operates
 gati niamak kaa mukhya kaary ingine kii gati kaa niyaman karnaa he
 The speed-regulator of a steam engine keeps the speed of cruises constant with the help of these two methods: shakti kii maang ke anusaar bhaap kii daab ko badhaakar yaa ghataakar ingine kii gati kaa niyaman karanevaale gatiniamak ko avrodh gatiniamak kehete hai
 The actuator drives a barrier valve, which is placed in the main steam tube
 is prakaar ke gatiniamakon main mukhya gatipalak kanduk gatiniamak hota he
 The valve is of a balanced type, that is, the resultant force by the steam is zero
 jab ingine kii gati badhati he, gatiniamak kandukon ke paribhraman kii gati main bhi vruddhi ho jaati he, jisase kentrapasari bal bad jaataa he
 This increase of force forces them to move out against the forces of gravity and control
 iske chalate valve kuch ansh main band ho jaataa he
 The pressure of the steam acting on the piston decreases when the valve is blocked, which also reduces the power generated
 evam ingine kii gati main kami hone ke kaaran valve kamaani upar uth jaati he evam ingine kii gati main kami hone ke kaaran valve kamaani upar uth jaati he evam piston par kaary karanevaali bhaap kii daab main vruddhi ho jaati he, jiske falswaroop gati badhkar saamaanya gati par aa jaati he
 a simple line will be obtained if the weight of the steam transferred per hour in the engine is measured with horsepower after the use of a regular steam engine by the barrier speed-regulator
 yah sambandh sarvapratham vilian ne paaya tha
 Hence, it is called "the line of Villian" in his name

 Ordinary rail engines have the behavior of a horizontal steam engine
 yah ingine rail ingine boyler ke paas thos aadhaar par laga rahata he
 Almost all the locomotives do not have condenser

 There are two types of such engines: aadhunik dizine main in donon prakaaron ko jod diya jaataa he, arthath kuch silinder ingine ke frem ke andar rahete hai evam kuch silinder baahar rahete hai
 Several changes have been made to James Watt's steam engine, although the main principle is still the same
 parivartanon kii aavashyaktaa bhaap ingine ke anekanek kaayon main prayukt hone ke kaaran hui
 Watt used low pressure in a steam engine because he feared an explosion
 lekin aajkal sarvatra ucch daab ingine hi prayukt kiye jate hai kyonki inaki dakshata bhi nimna daab ingine kii apeksha adhik hoti he
 The condenser of a modern engine consists of a number of taps into which soft water is flowed by a pump
 ek or pump bhaap ke sanghanan se bane pani or hawa ko nikaalane ke liye laga hota he
