 Squeeze's Boast: a relatively difficult shot that is hit from the front of the court when the ball is very close to the adjacent wall
 iskaa asar trical bost ke samaan hi hota he, lekin apni kathinaayee kii vajah se yah adhik bhraamak he
 10
 Skid Boast: The ball is hit high on the adjacent wall near the front wall so that it falls into the opposite back corner, passing through the court

 nik shot: gend ko 'woli' kiya jaataa he yaa ek oochaal par maaraa jaataa he, cross court or itani shakti ke saath ki vah saamne kii diwaar se takaraati he phir bagal vaali diwaar ke jankshan se or farsh se 
 jab acchhee tarah se maaraa jaataa he to gend main kam yaa koi oochaal nahin hoti he or yah farsh ke saath ludhakti he 
 a common strategy is to hit the ball up from the side walls directly to the back corners; This is the basic squash shot, referring to it as a "rail", straight drive, wall, or "length"
 is shot ko maarane ke baad, khilaadi court ke centre main "T" ke paas chalaa jaataa he taaki vah pratidwandvi kii vaapasi kaa saamana karne ke liye behatar sthiti main ho
 Attacking with a light or "short" shot in the front corners results in the opponent covering the majority of the court, allowing the winner to immediately emerge
 gend ke saamne tak pahunchane se pehle hi bost yaa angel shot ko jaanboojh kar ek ore kii bagal vaali diwaar par maaraa jaataa he
 This shot is used to deceive and the opponent again to cover most of the court
 squash main ek pramukh ranneeti he "T par haaavee hona" 
 kushal khilaadi shot ko lautaaenge or phir aglaa shot khilne se pehle "T" kii ore waapas chale jaaenge
 is sthiti se, virdohi ke agle shot ko praapt karne ke liye, khilaadi shighrata se nunatam harkaton ke saath court ke kisi bhi bhaag kaa upyog kar saktaa he
 There may be 30 or more shots at rallies between experienced players and therefore special emphasis is placed on fitness, both aerobic and non-aerobic
 As players become more efficient, in particular, getting better at getting a shot, scoring points often becomes a war of attrition
 khel ke ucch str par, zyaada chust-durust khilaadi behatar laabh kii sthiti main hota he
 The ability to change the direction of the ball at the last moment is also important to counterbalance the opponent
 visheshgy khilaadi, ek ausat khilaadi kii tulana main adhik tikshnata ke saath second ke dasven hisse main pratidwandvi ke shot ko bhaanp sakate hai, jisase unhen sheeghra pratikriya karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 Since two players are confined within a shared space, interference and hindrance are essential aspects of the game
 aam taur par, niyam ke anusaar khilaadi, gend ko saamne kii diwaar se takaraane se pehle spasht dekhne ke liye, gend kaa sidhi rekha main sidhe saamana karne liye, court ke kisi bhi hisse main ek uchit ghumaav or ek bina baadha ke shot maarane, chaahe saamne, bagal main, yaa peeche kii diwaar par maarane ke liye jisamen ve sakasham hai, ve hakdaar hai
 When interference occurs, a player may appeal for a "lay" and the referee explains the extent of the interference
 referi, ek let kii anumati dene kaa chunaav kar saktaa he or phir khilaadi us ank ko phir se khelte hai, yaa hastkshep ke str par nirbhar karte hue apil karne vaale khilaadi ko ek "stroke" pradaan kar saktaa he, referi dekhtaa he ki kya hastkshep karne vaale khilaadi ne ise bachaane ke liye paryaapt prayaas kiye or kya baadhit khilaadi dwaara ek nirnaayak shot lagane kii sambhaavna thi, agar use baadhit nahin kiya gaya hota
 An exception to all of this is when the intervening player is directly in the path of the other player's movement and effectively stops that action, a stroke is always awarded in such a case
 jab yah samajha jaataa he ki baadha bahut kam thi yaa nahin thi, yaa donon hi bataanaa asambhav hota he to, niyam ke anusaar, khel kii nirantarata banaae rakhane ke liye or let ke liye farji apil ko hatotsahit karne ke liye koi let pradaan karne kii anumati nahin di jaani chahie
 Because of the subjective symptoms in explaining the nature of the intervention and its intensity, the rendering of lat and stroke is often controversial
 jab ek khilaadi kaa shot saamne kii diwaar par lagane se pehle uske pratidwandvi ko chooti he to ise ek hastkshep mana jaataa he
 This is usually a lat if the ball was going towards the adjacent wall or if it has already hit the side wall and is now moving directly towards the front wall before it hits the opponent
 haalanki, yah us khilaadi ke liye stroke hota he jisane gend ko maaraa yadi gend sidhe saamne vaali diwaar kii taraf bad rahi thi or bagal vaali diwaar se takaraane se pehle vah pratidwandvi se takaraa gai
 Usually after a player is hit by a ball, both players stand still, if the player who has the ball is standing directly in front of the player hitting the ball, he loses stroke and if he is not standing in front
 , Then a lat is played
 yadi yah samajha jaataa he ki gend ko maarane vaala khilaadi jaanboojhkar apane pratidwandvi ko maarane kii koshish kar rahaa he to vah stroke kho degaa
 An exception to all this is when the player hitting the ball is "turned", that is, the ball is passed to him from one side, but he kills it when he comes back from the back wall
 in maamalon main, stroke us khilaadi ke paas jaataa he jise gend lagi
 There are many forms of squash played around the world
 america main apekshaakrit adhik kathor gend or bhinn aakaar ke court par hardball singles or dubles khelaa jaataa he 
 hardball ne uttari america main apni adhikansh lokapriyata kho di he, lekin hardball dubles khel abhi bhi sakriy he
 There is also a doubles version of the standard ball-played squash, sometimes with a wider court and a tennis-like appearance known as squash tennis
 apekshaakrit chota court or kam oochaal vaali gend apane america chachere bhai, racketbaal kii tulana main ank arjan ko mushkil bana detii he, kyonki usamen gend ko chaaron konon main khelaa ja saktaa he
 Since every ball must hit the front wall above the tin, the ball cannot be easily "killed"
 As a result, rallies last longer than racquetball

 ek satat paryaavarniya samasya jiskaa chiang maai saamana kar rahaa he vah he vaayu pradooshan ke badhane kii samasya jo mukhyatah april se prarambh ho kar agle kai hafton tak chalata he
 This issue has been accepted for some time
 1996 main, paryaavaran anupaalan or pravartan sammelan ke chauthe antarrashtriya network, jo ki us varsh chiang maai main yojit kiya gaya tha, chiang maai ke tatkaaleen rajyapal, viraachaai naivaboonian ne atithi vaktaa dow jayaapan vondburanavatt, jo ki us samay maai chyang vishvavidhyalay main saamaajik vigyaan sankaay ke dean the, ko aamantrit kiya tha, taaki ve chiang maai main vaayu pradooshan ke liye kiye ja rahen prayaason par vichaar-vimarsh kar saken
 dow vondburanavatt ne us samay 1994 main kaha tha ki, aspataalon main shahari nagarikon kii sankhya bad rahi he jo vaayu pradooshan ke kaaran upji shwasan sambandhi samasyaon ke liye aate hai
 The pollution control department of Thailand's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is active in addressing this problem, along with public awareness campaigns and other initiatives
 is avadhi ke dauraan, varsh ke baaki maheenon ke vipareet, chiang maai main hawa kii gunvattta aksar maanak se neeche rahati he kyonki yahan dhul ke kan apane maanak se dugune str par pahunch jate hai
 The northern center of the Meteorological Department has reported that low pressure areas of China are affected by the smoke of the forests around the Thai Myanmar border
 chiang maai main vaayu gunvattta pichley das saalon main spasht rup se kharaab hui he
 Efforts are being made to solve this problem through a number of initiatives and, to some extent, with the increase in economic development in cities, to prevent negative environmental impact
 aksar is avadhi ke dauraan shahar main dhundh bani rahati he or jisase barsaat hone lagati he
 Levels of microscopic dust particles have occasionally been tested that yield between 190 and 243 micrograms per cubic meter
 chiang maai main dhul janit pradooshan ke maamuli sroton main jalati hui vasteen bhi hai, jisamen antim sanskaar, kachra jalanaa, yaa phir kharaab dijal ke kaaran vaahanon main se nikalataa hua dhuna he
 For these minor reasons, flying dust is also added during construction and excavation
 jaisaa kii upgrah se liye gaye chitra darshaate hai, unke anusaar vaayu pradooshan kaa mukhya kaaran pahari kshetron main sadeeyon se chali aa rahi pratha he, jiske antargat jangalon ke jhaad-jhankhaad jala kar saafe kiye jate hai visheshkar, thai myanmar seemaa par
 The problem of Chiang Mai also increases because the city, like the city of Los Angeles and Salt Lake, is a natural geographic bowl surrounded by hills
 parinamtah hawa kii awajahi dhimi pad jaati he or vah kaaron or jalte hue kachare se jo dhul kan nikalate hai unhen bhi uthaa leti he
 Because of this inverse effect, when the air in the bowl blows, it again turns and sits again in the city
 aisa tab tak chalata rahata he jab tak hawaaon ke rukh main badlaav nahin hota he yaa barsaat kii phuhaar hawa saafe nahin kar detii
 thailand ke prakritik sansaadhan or paryaavaran mantralay kaa thailand pradooshan niyantran vibhaag is khatarnaak samasya kaa samaadhaan dhundne kaa sakriy rup se prayaas kar rahaa he or kai varshon se yah prayaas karte hue vah chiang maai kaa vaayu gunvattta suchakank sankhya kam karne main safal bhi hua he
 This problem is exacerbated by various colored public transport plying in Chiand Mai and Thailand, which is very cheap to riders and called Songthev
 laal rang ke songthev yatriyon ko unke anurodh par shahar main har jagah le jate hai jabaki anya rangon ke songthev nirdhaarit margon par chalate hai
 People ride on the back of these trucks and have diesel engines
 in vaahanon kii horse power badhaane ke liye inaki nikaas pranali ko hataa diya jaataa he jisase un carbon utsarjan or baari dhaatuon kii maatra bad jaati he jo vaahanon ke peeche se nikalate hai
 As a result, motorcycling on the streets of Chiang Mai is becoming increasingly difficult
 motorcycle savaaron ko in trakon ke peeche jate hue apni shwaas nalika ko bachaate hue aasaani se dekha ja saktaa he
 The same can be said about the famous tuk-tuk, which are found everywhere in Thailand
 shahar ke adhikari is mudde se bhalee bhaanti parichit hai or unhone ek abhiyaan prarambh kiya he, jiske antargat sabhi puraane or kharaab vaahanon kii jagah, aadhunik pili or neeli meter vaali texiyaan lagaai jaayegi
 jaise jaise dhire dhire, ye puraani gunvattta ke vaahan hathaaye ja rahe hai, ye abhi bhi dekhnaa baaki he ki kya vinimyan nikaay chiang maai main, in vaahanon ke chaalkon ke pratorodh kaa saamana karte hue parivartan kar paayenge yaa nahin, kyonki in vaahan chaalkon ne paramparaagat rup se pichley kai saalon se isi tarah se apni jeevika chalaai he
 It can be said that Chiang Mai is not the only city that is struggling with this problem because Tuk-tuk and Songtheov are the main means of low cost transportation throughout Thailand
 durbhaagya se, kyonki chiang maai kii sthiti ek ulate hue katore kii tarah he vaahanon main se jo carbon padaarth utsarjit hote hai, ve samasya ko or gambhir karte hai
 For the past several years, as Chiang Mai's air quality index has deteriorated more and more against other regions, this problem is now being recognized locally
 chiang maai main doctoron ne unhen upree shwaas kathinaaiyon ke saath aane vaale logon main vruddhi dekhi he
 Chiang Mai now has stricter emission standards for all vehicles
 2008 se, police kabhi kabhi sadak par sadak band karne vaale blox laga kar sthal par hi vaahanon ke utsarjan kaa pareekshan karti he or adhikari kharaab vaahanon kaa nishedh karne ke kanoonon ko adhiniyamit karenge, kyonki chiang maai main ek svachh vaataavaran banane kii disha main sakriy rup se kaam jari he

 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kali Yuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 jain sahitya bahut vishaal he
 It is mostly religious literature
 sanskrit, praakrit or apbhransh bhashaaon main yah sahitya likhaa gaya he
 Magadha has been the center of Mahavira's tendencies, so he gave his sermon here in Ardhamagadhi, the lingua franca which is safe among the available Jain proceeds
 ye aagam 45 hai or inhen shwetambar jain pramaan maanate hai, digambar jain nahin
 According to the Dingbar, the Agama literature has been estranged from time immemorial
 digambar shatkhandgam ko sweekaar karte hai jo 12wein angadrushtiwad kaa ansh mana gaya he
 The language of ancient literature of Digambars is Shaurseni
 aage chalakar apbhransh tathaa apbhransh kii uttarkalin lok-bhashaaon main jain panditon ne apni rachanaayen likhakar bhashaa sahitya ko samrudh banaaya
 In the ancient literature, the texts of Jain literature are found in most number and most authentically
 jain rachanakaaron ne puraana kavy, charit kavy, katha kavy, raas kavy aadi vividh prakaar ke granth rache
 Swayambhu, Pushp Dant, Hemachandra, Somprabha Suri etc
 are the main Jain poets
 inhone hinduon main prachlit lok kathaon ko bhi apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or parampara se alag uski parinti apane matanukool dikhaai
 The oldest part of Jain literature is called 'agam'
 ye aagam 46 hai- The Agam Granth is quite ancient, and the place which is of Vedas in Vedic literature and of Tripitaka in Buddhist literature, the same place is of Agamas in Jain literature
 aagam granthon main mahavir ke upadeshon tathaa jain samskruti se sambandh rakhane vaali anek katha-kahaniyon kaa sankalan he
 According to Jain tradition, after 160 years of Mahavira Nirvana, there was a great downturn in Magadha countries, due to which the Jain monks had to relocate elsewhere
 dushkaal samaapt ho jane par shraman patliputra main ekatrit hue or yahan khand-khand karke gyaarah angon kaa sankalan kiya gaya, barahawaan ang kisi ko samaran nahin tha, isliye uskaa sankalan na kiya ja sakaa
 This conference is known as 'pataliputra-vachana'
 kuch samay pashchaat jab aagam sahitya kaa phir viched hone laga to mahavir nirvana ke 827 yaa 840 varsh baad jain saadhuon ke duusare sammelan hue
 One in Mathura under the chairmanship of Aryaskandil and the other under the chairmanship of Nagarjuna Suri
 mathura ke sammelan ko 'maathuri-vaachana' kii sangya di gayi he
 Then after about 150 years, 980 or 993 years after Mahavira Nirvana, the fourth conference of sadhus was held in Vallabhi under the chairmanship of Devardhigini Apology, in which the proceeds were systematically compiled for the last time
 se 'valbhi-vaachana' ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 The present proceeds are the form of this concept
 jain aagmon kii ukt teen sankalanaaon ke itihaas se pataa lagata he ki samay-samay par aagam sahitya ko kaaphi kshati uthaani padi, or yah sahitya apane moulik rup main surakshit nahin rah sakaa
 This seems to be the reason that this literature is very less compared to the Buddhist literature, and it was probably due to the disorder in this literature that the Digambara sect refused to accept it
 isa ke purv lagbhag chauthi shatabdi se lagaakar isvi san paanchavi shatabdi tak kii bharatvarsh kii aarthik tathaa saamaajik dasha kaa chithran karne vaala yah sahitya anek drushtiyon se mahatva kaa he
 a detailed description of the ethos of Jain monks in texts like Ayarang, Suyagand, Uttarajhayana, Daswayaliya etc
, it corresponds very much to the Buddhist Dhammapada, Suttanipat and Mahabharata, etc
, and according to the statement of scholars like Dr
 Vintranese, that shramana
 - symbolizes poetry
 bhashaa or vishay aadi kii drushti se jain aagmon kaa yah bhaag sabase pracheen maaloom hota he
 In texts like Bhagwati Kalpasutra, Owaiah, Thanang, Nirayavali, Shramana gives a detailed description of Lord Mahavira, his Chariya, his teachings and the erstwhile king, prince and his war, which reveal many of the endangered practices of Jain history
 nayadhammakaha, uwasgadasa, antgavadasa, anuttarovaviyadasa, vivagasuy aadi granthon main mahavir dwaara kahi hui anek katha-kahaniyaan tathaa unki shishy-shishyaaon kaa varnan he, jisamen jain parampara sambandhi anek baton kaa parichay miltaa he
 Many important topics related to Vaastu Shastra, music, flora, etc
 are described in the texts like Raipanesya, Jeevabhigam, Pannavana, which is not available elsewhere
 chhedsutron main saadhuon ke aahaar-vihaar tathaa praayshchit aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisaki tulana baudhon ke vinayapitak se kii sakati he
 It is told in the Vrhatkalpasutra that when Mahavira Saket was a monk in a garden called Subhumibhaga, at that time he allowed his monks and nuns to visit the monastery in the east of Saket, up to Kaushambi of Daksai, and to Kunala in the north
 isse pataa lagata he ki armbh main jain dharm kaa prachaar simit tha, tathaa jain shraman magadh or uttar pradesh ke kuch hisson ko chhodkar anyatra nahin ja sakate the
 Of course, this part of the Holesutras is as ancient as Mahavira himself
 tatpashchaat raja kanishka ke samakaleen mathura ke jain shilalekhon main bhinn-bhinn gana, kul or shakhaon kaa ullekh he, vah bhadravahu ke kalpasutra main varnit gana, kul or shakhaon ke saath praayah mail khaataa he
 This also reveals the authenticity of Jain scriptures
 vastutah is samay tak jain parampara main shwetambar or digambar kaa bhed nahin maaloom hota
 The resemblance of Pali Tripitaka in the subject, language etc
 of Jain proceeds also reflects the antiquity of this literature
 pali-sutron kii attakathaon kii tarah aagmon kii bhi anek tikaa-tippaniyan, deepika, nivritti, vivaran, avchuri aadi likhi gayi hai
 This literature can be divided into four divisions, namely, Nirukti, Bhashya, Churni and Tika, combining Agam and it is called 'panchangi'
 aagam sahitya kii tarah yah sahitya bhi bahut mahatva kaa he
 In this, the subject of Agams is given in detail
 is sahitya main anek anushrutiyaan surakshit hai, jo aitihaasik drushti se atyant mahatvapurn hai
 There is a wide variety of archaeological material in the commentaries, such as large-scale, practical, practical, nihilakrini, essentials, essentials, Uttarayana tika, etc
, due to which India’s customs, fair festivals, monks, cults, times, floods, thieves, robbers, sartwahs, trade The routes, crafts, art, food, houses, jewelery, etc
, throw a lot of light on various subjects
 lok-katha or bhashaa shaastra kii drushti se bhi yah sahitya bahut mahatva kaa he

 Photosynthesis is affected by many factors
 iske kuch kaarak bahya hote hai tathaa kuch bhitari
 Additionally there are some limiting factors
 bahya kaaran ve hote he jo prakruti or paryaavaran main sthit hote hue prakaash sanshleshan ko prabhavit karte hai jaise prakaash, carbondai oxide, taapmaana tathaa jal
 Internal causes are those that affect photosynthesis while being located in the leaves, such as foliage harem, pruritus, congestion of food, internal structure of leaves, and age of leaves
 iske atirikt prakaash sanshleshan ko in sabhi vastuon kii gati bhi prabhavit karti he
 When an action of photosynthesis is controlled by various factors, the speed of photosynthesis is controlled by the slowest factor
 prakaash, carbondioxide, jal, chlorophyl ityadi main se jo bhi uchit pariman se kam pariman main hota he, vah puri kriya kii gati ko niyantrit rakhata he
 This factor is called time-bounded factor
 jab ek kriya vibhinn karkon dwaara niyantrit hoti he tab prakaash sanshleshan kii gati sabase mand kaarak dwaara simit hoti he
 F
 In 1905, E
 Blackman wrote this information in his research paper on photosynthesis
 baad main yah ek niyam ban gaya jiskaa mahatv keval prakaash-sanshleshan hi nahin sabhi jaev-rasaynic kriyaayon ke liye he
 The speed of photosynthesis is controlled by factors like light, carbon dioxide, water, chlorophyll
 inamen se jo bhi uchit pariman se kam pariman main hota he, vah puri kriya kii gati ko niyantrit rakhata he evam usee us samay ke liye seemaabaddh kaarak kaha jaataa he

 dharmarany main samadhisth bhagwaan shiv ke tisare netra se kaamdev ke bhasma ho jane kii katha ko maharishi valmiki ne uparokt shlokon main varnit kiya he
 The episode is about Avadhesh Kumar Rama and Lakshmana traveling from Ayodhya to the Siddhashram of Byaghrasar along with sage Vishwamitra
 shlokon kaa arth is prakaar he : Both the Mahabali princes paid obeisance to the ascetic Vishmamitra by chanting mantra-karma, tarpan and gayatri mantra in the morning and were ready to go on
 unako saath liye vishwamitra us sthal par pahunche jahaan ganga or sarayu kaa sangam he
 There, both those princes saw the Most Holy Ashram of many fiery sages who had been performing harsh austerities there for thousands of years
 un parampavitra ashramon ko dekh shriramchandra ji or lakshmana param prasann hue or mahatma vishwamitra se bole, “he bhagwan yah param pavitra ashram kiskaa he or ab yahaan koun purush rahata he? ham donon ko iskaa vrittant sunne kaa bada kautuhal he
 “both the Mahabali princes worshiped the ascetic Vishwamitra in the morning by chanting the rituals, tarpan and gayatri and were ready to go on

 “the sage Vishwamitra laughed after hearing the prince's curiosity about the resplendent ashram at Tapovan
 unhone kaha he ram, suniye main batalaata hum pehle yah kiskaa ashram tha

 King Kavaleshwar of Awadh built the temple of Lord Shiva here in the eighth century
 jisaki vajah se is mandir ko kavaleshwar nath mandir bhi kaha jaataa he
 During the Istmari settlement in the United Provinces, the British Governor General Lord Cornwallis has recorded Kavaleshwar Tal, the lake located near this temple in the official gazette
 puranic granthon or valmiki ramayana ke anusaar tretayug main is sthaan par maharishi vishwamitra ke saath bhagwaan shriram or lakshmana bhi aaye the
 Here Durvasa Rishi also did penance

 According to Shivpuran, Mahabali Tarakasura meditated and received such a boon from Brahma ji under which he could only die at the hands of Shivaputra

 apni kritiyon ke liye yah nimnaankit sansthaaon se sammanit hai- Prakash Parimal, Contact * Mumbai * - 97, Badhwar Park, Wood House Road, Colaba, Mumbai - 4 xxrep 4 0 5 + 91-22-22024151 mahapurashivanand goswamishok aatreya When light or sound waves collide with an obstacle, they fold over the edges of the barrier and enter the geometric shadow of the resistor
 tarango ke is prakaar mudane kii ghatana ko vivartan kehete hai
 It has been found that after hitting small size barriers, the waves turn and when the wave passes through small sized holes, it propagates
 sabhi prakaar kii tarangon se vivartan hota he 
 If an opaque object is placed between a photogenic source and the curtain, the shadow of the object is created on the screen
 bahudhaa chaaya kaa kinaaraa tikshn hota he or uske chaaron ore parde kaa bhaag samaan rup se prakashit rahata he
 If the light source is small in point, the edge of the shadow is not found sharp when looked at carefully
 kinare par prakaash or andhkaar kii dhaariyaan dikhaai padati hai
 It seems that the rays of light have twisted and reached within the range of geometric shadows
 is ghatana ko prakaash kaa vivartan kehete hai
 The stripes formed along the edge of the shadow are called diffraction patterns
 vivartan kii jaankaree se purv yahi mana jaataa tha ki kisi ek madhyam main prakaash sidhi rekhaon main chalata he
 But diffraction cannot be explained on the basis of simple linear movement of light
 sarvapratham newton, greemaldi or tii
 yang ne is ghatana par dhyaan diya tha
 Newton and Grimaldi were the promoters and followers of the corpuscles of light, so they tried unsuccessfully to understand the phenomenon of diffraction on this basis
 baad main chrishchiyan hygange ne prakaash ke tarang siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya or e
 je
 frenel tathaa frounhophar ne isi siddhant ke aadhaar par vivartan tathaa vivartan se sambandhit anya ghatnaon ko safalataa purvak samajhaayaa
 When a round hole, rectangular lineage, sharp core or fine wire of an object is placed in the path of light, different diffraction patterns are formed in each case
 vivartan kii sabhi ghatnaon ko do vibhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he : Fraunhofer diffraction and Frennel diffraction
 jab prakashasrot or pardaa vivartak vastu se atyant dur hote hai, arthath vivartak par samtal tarangagra apaatit hota he, tab vivartan pattern ko frounhophar pattern or ghatana ko frounhophar vivartan kaha jaataa he
 When the source, curtain, or both, are at a fixed distance from the reflecting object, ie, the spherical or cylindrical wavelength is incident on the deflector, the phenomenon of diffraction is called frennel diffraction
 frenel vivartan dekhnaa apekshaakrit saral hota he, kintu ise samajhnaa kathin hota he
 To see the Fraunhofer diffraction, a special type of arrangement has to be done, which gives a flat wavelength
 vivartan ke baad use pun: focus karne kii vyavastha kerani padati he, kintu iskaa siddhant samajhnaa bahut saral he
 Fronhofer diffraction: - Diffraction in which the light source and the curtain are at an infinite distance from the resistor
 sodium lap se pile rang kaa ekvarni prakaash praapt hota he
 With the help of a lens, this light is applied to a very narrow line of scintillation in a black curtain, then this line itself acts as a light source
 ab is rekhachhidr ke aage lens lagaakar samaantar kiranpunj ko ek duusare rekhachhidr par daalaa jaae tathaa is rekhachhidr ke peeche safed pardaa rakhaa jaae, to parden par duusare rekhachhidr kaa vivartan pattern ban jaataa he
 There is a very intense band or band in the middle of this pattern
 is pattee ke donon ore apekshaakrit bahut kam tivrata kii or bhi pattiyaan pai jaati hai
 The middle belt is called the main height and other strips are the secondary height
 do sameepvarti rekhachhidron kaa vivartan pattern ek rekhachhidr ke vivartan pattern se kuch bhinn hota he
 In the pattern of a lineage, where the diaphragm is found, in the pattern of the two lines, many stripes are formed at the same places, which are thinner and sharper than the earlier bands
 jyon-jyon rekhachhidron kii sankhya badhati jaati he, dwitiyak ucchishth kii dhaariyaan ksheen hoti jaati hai or mukhya ucchishth kii dhaariyaan atyant tikshn hoti jaati hai
 The width of the line and their mutual distance also greatly affect the sharpness of these stripes
 shishe kii samtal pattee par heere kii kani se rekhaayen khinch di jaaen, to prayek do rekha ke bich kaa paardarshak sthaan rekhachhidr kaa kaam karata he
 a group of similar lineages is called Grenting
 grating kaa avishkaar frounhophar ne kiya tha
 He made a grating by wrapping fine wire over two screws
 prayek do taron ke bich kaa sthaan rekhachhidr kaa kaam karata he
 He later drew grating by drawing lines on a glass plate
 rolland ne 1882 i
 main grating kii rekhaayen banaanevaali mashin banaai
 Nowadays, up to 30,000 or 40,000 lines are drawn on one inch by good machines
 yadi kisi prakashasrot ke sammukh lens rakhkar, ekvarni samaantar kirnon ko ek grating par daalaa jaae, to isse praapt vivartan main ek duusari se dur dur kai tikshn rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 These lines are actually the diffraction images of the porous source
 bich kii sabase teevr rekha ko shunya koti kii rekha kehete hai
 The first, second, third lines on both sides of it are called first, second and third lines respectively
 yadi grating par shwet prakaash daalaa jaae, to shunya koti kii rekha shwet hoti he, kintu anya koti kii rekhaon sthaan par spectrum praapt hote hai
 These are called spectrum of first, second, third etc
 respectively
 yadi grating se vivartit honevaale prakaash kaa tarangadairghy l, aaptit tarangagra kaa aapatan kone i or vivartan kone q ho tathaa kinhin do samipsth rekhachhidron ke madhyabinduon kii parsparik duuri d ho, to d = nl
 n spectrum kii koti kaa dyotak he
 The grating described above is called plane diffraction grating
 yadi vakr shishe par aluminium kii kalai kar di jaae or usee par heere kii kani se rekhaayen khurch di jaaen, to prayek do rekhaon ke bich kaa bhaag ek nanhen paravarti darpan kaa kaam karata he
 Diffraction patterns are also formed by the interference of the reflected waves from these parts
 is grating ko avatal grating kehete hai
 It was invented by Roland
 avatal grating avatal darpan kaa bhi kaam karata he
 Therefore, lenses do not have to be used to focus the diffracted rays
 spectrumiki main spectrum praapt karne ke liye vakr grating se bade upyogi spectrograph banaae gaye hai
 Even for curve grating, the formula for wavelength is d = nl
 do vibhinn varnon kii rashmiyon ko ek duusare se pruthak karne kii kshamta ko grating kii varnavikshepan kshamta kaha jaataa he
 If l1- l2 = Dl and their diffraction angles are q1 and q2 and q1 - q2 = Dq respectively, the grating has a character deflection capacity
 tarangadairghy ke sutara se iskaa maan hota he
 Character deflection capacity increases in higher order respectively
 yadi l or l+dl do atyant sameepvarti vikiran hon or grating dwaara inako ek duusare se alag-alag dekha ja sake to dl ko grating kii vibhedan kshamta kehete hai
 n is the number of total lines drawn on the grating
 kramash: ucchtar koti main vibhedan kshamta bhi badhati jaati he
 Frennel diffraction: - a diffraction in which the light source and the curtain are at a limited distance from the resistor or a baffle
 chaaya ke kinare par vivartan pattern kaa bananaa prakaash ke saral raikhik gaman se nahin samajhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Frennel used wave theory to explain this
 kisi tarangagra ke vibhinn binduon kaa prabhaav samajhane ke liye unhone ardh kaal jone kaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya
 The zone plate based on this principle works like a lens and confirms Frennel's theory
 yadi kisi atyant chote chhidr par ekvarni samtal tarangagra aaptit hota ho, to parden par iskaa vivartan pattern ban jaataa he
 Circular stripes are found in this pattern
 sabase bahari dhari sabase adhik moti hoti he or bhitari dhaariyaan kramash: patali hoti hai
 This diffraction can be interpreted on the basis of Frennel's half-zone
 yadi chhidr kaa aakaar pratham ardhakaal zone ke baraabar ho or pattern ke centre tathaa chhidr kii paridhi kii duriyon kaa antar l / 2 ho, to pattern kaa centre prakashit hota he
 If the size of the hole is increased by keeping the hole distance constant from the curtain, then this center is illuminated and unpublished respectively
 jab chhidr kaa aakaar ardhakaal-zone samavisht karata he, to pattern kaa centre chamkila hota he or jab chhidr main 2m ardh-kaal-zone samavisht hote hai, to centre kaala hota he
 The center also changes when the curtain is brought near or far from it by keeping the hole stable
 yadi pattern ke centre se chhidr ke centre or chhidr kii paridhi kii duriyon kaa antar l / 2 ho, to centre chamkila, anyathaa kaala, hota he
 a bright dot is always formed at the center of the diffraction pattern of the round disk
 kisi prakaashiya yantra dwaara kisi bindu strot kaa bimb vastav main us yantra ke dwarak se hokar janevaali tarangon kaa vivartan pattern hota he
 If two point sources are very close together, one diffraction pattern of each is formed by the device
 chunki sabhi prakaashiya yantron main vartual dwarak hota he, at: bindu sroton ke vivartan pattern main vartual bindu banataa he or uske kinare kinare kai vartual valay hote hai
 The larger the grating of the device, the smaller the diffraction pattern
 yadi prakaashiya yantra dwaara do atyant samipsth bindu sroton ke vivartan pattern itane chote or spasht bane ki ek kaa kendriya mahattam prakashit bhaag duusare ke sarvapratham nunatam prakashit bhaag par pade, to donon ke kendriya bindu spasht dekhen ja sakate hai
 This capability of the optical instrument is called resolution
 bahudhaa akaash main badalon kii upasthiti ke samay surya athwa chandramaa ke chaaron ore ek chamkila gheraa dikhaai padataa he
 It is called Kirit
 pani kii nanheen boondon dwaara prakaash kaa vivartan hone se hi kirit banate hai
 It is necessary to have small droplets for clear crown
 ye boonde jitani hi adhik choti hoti hai kirit kaa vyas utana hi bada hota he
 t Young designed a device for calculating the diameter of watercourses by measuring the diameter of the kirits, which is called a fibrometer
 vivartan or vyatikaran main siddhantat: koi bhed nahin he
 Even then it is often said that the amplitude of the waveform is determined by integrating the effect of each of the minimum segments of the wave amplitude due to the overlapping of some fixed number of light elements in the interpolation
 ek se adhik rekhachhidron kaa vivartan pattern, vivartan or vyatikaran ke sanyukt prabhaav se, banataa he
 In short; Diffraction is only a minor form of interference

 ansaoods aakaar main bahut chota he - iskaa vyas keval 400 kimi he, jo shani ke sab se bade chadramaa, titan, kaa sirf dasavaan he
 Despite this small size, a variety of things are seen on its surface, from mounds and trenches to pits made of meteorite strikes
 ansaoods kii sataha par adhiktar pani kii barf kii ek moti tah faili hui he
 Because of this icy surface, the albedo of Ansaladus is 1
38, which is more than any other known object of the solar system

 Anselus is one of only three objects on the outskirts of our solar system that have been actively observed in volcanic form
 ansaoods ke dakshini dhruv ke paas pani ugalate hue phuwware hai
 Scientists believe that the reason for this is that the fierce gravity of Saturn makes the Ansaladus with its tidal force, which causes it to melt a lot of snow and is seen as some of these fountains

 This means that on the ground of Ansaladus, the earth continues to move and move

 This area is called the "lion stripes" area

 The gravitational effects on the place where this ring is located are such that the pieces present in this ring should dissipate within 10,000 to 100,000 years
 kuch vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke i challe kaa bahut sa malba ansaoods ke barf ke phuwwaron se hi aata he
 As the old debris of this ring gets shattered, more debris comes from the fountains of Anseladus and keeps the rings intact
