 Tengri was the main deity of the religion of the ancient Turks and the Mongol people
 inaki manyata shiyongnu or shiyanbei jaise bahut si mongol or turki samudaayon main thi or inke naam par un logon ke dharm ko tengri dharm bulaayaa jaataa he
 The earliest Khaganat of the Turkish people, named Goekturk Khaganat, also named him their national deity, and his khaganas also cited the reason for his enthronement as 'tengri's will'
 tengri ko 'akaash kaa devtaa' yaa 'nile akaash kaa pita' kaha jaataa tha
 Mongol rulers often spoke of the desire of 'eternal blue sky' behind their rule
 pracheen mongolon or turkon kaa maananaa tha ki tengri manushyon ko shakti-daan karte the jise unki bhashaa main 'qut' kaha jaataa tha
 Note the pronunciation of the dotted 'q' in the word 'qut' as it is slightly different from the pointless 'k'
 bahut se turki or mongol hastiyon ke naam 'qut' shabd par aadhaarit the, jaise ki 'qutalug', 'tengriqut' or 'qutalmish' 
 Although Tengri religion disappeared with the introduction of Islam and Buddhism in the Turkish and Mongol regions, its symbols are still spread in the region - budhoopur eta jile ke patiyaali prakhand kaa ek gaanv he

 Satyagraha literally means to urge for truth

 The reason for this was simply the discrimination between black gore
 yadi pratipakshi kii shakti hamase adhik he to sashastr virodh kaa koi arth nahin rah jaataa ve ahimsha ko maanate the isliye ve yah ladaai lard rahe the 
 In order to avoid strong rivalry, the strategy of "disarmament resistance" was used
 england main striyon ne matadhikaar praapt karne ke liye isi "niskriy pratirodh' kaa maarg apanaaya tha
 Thus in retaliation, it was considered appropriate to harass the opponent by attacking him with weapons in every other way, to harm him by deceit, or to demean him by making an alliance with his enemy
 gandhi ji ko is prakaar kii durniti pasand nahin thi
 The methodology of his movement was very different in South Africa, his philosophy was completely different, so he felt the need for a new word for his war strategy
 sahi shabd praapt karne ke liye unhone ek pratiyogita kii jisamen swargeey maganlaal gandhi ne ek shabd sujhaayaa "sadaagrah' jisamen thodaa parivartan karke gandhi ji ne "satyagrah' shabd sweekaar kiya
 The term "satyagraha" resembled the process of civil disobedience of the American philosopher Thoreau, who described the technique
 "satyagrah' kaa mul arth he satya ke prati aagrah satya ko pakade rahanaa or iske saath ahimsha ko maananaa 
 The main symptom of Satyagraha is not to be hostile to the unjust while outrightly opposing injustice
 hamen satya kaa paalan karte hue nirbhayatapurvak mrity kaa varan karnaa chahie or marate marate bhi jiske viruddh satyagrah kar rahe hai, uske prati vairabhav yaa krodh nahin karnaa chahie
 ' "satyagrah' main apane virdohi ke prati hinsa ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 He was a non-believer
 dhairya evam sahanubhuti se virdohi ko uski galati se mukt karnaa chahie, kyonki jo ek ko satya prathit hota he, vahiin duusare ko galat dikhaai de saktaa he
 Patience refers to suffering
 isliye is siddhant kaa arth ho gaya, "virdohi ko ksht athwa pidaa dekar nahin, balki swayan ksht uthaakar satya kaa rakshan
 ' mahatma gandhi ne kaha tha ki satyagrah main ek pad "prem' adhyahat he
 Satyagraha is a middle-aged compound
 satyagrah yani satya ke liye prem dwaara aagrah 
 Gandhiji gave a brief explanation of Satyagraha in front of Lord Inter as follows: "it is a movement which is completely based on truth and is being carried out in lieu of measures of violence
" ' ahimsa satyagrah darshan kaa sabase mahatvapurn tatv he, kyonki satya tak pahunchne or un par tike rahane kaa ekmaatr upaay ahimsa hi he
 And in Gandhiji's words, "ahimsa is not a negative attitude of not hurting anyone, but it is a legislative attitude of active love
 ' There is talk of suffering in Satyagraha itself
 satya kaa paalan karte hue mrityu ke varan kii baat he
 "fasting" is the most powerful weapon in the priest's arsenal of truth and non-violence
 jise kisi rup main hinsa kaa aashray nahin letaa he, uske liye upwas anivaary he
 Tolerance till death and therefore fasting till death is also the last weapon of Satyagrahi
 ' parantu agar upwas dusron ko majaboor karne ke liye atmpeedan kaa rup grahan kare to vah tyajya he : acharya vinoba jise saumy, saumytar, saumyatam satyagrah kehete hai, us bhoomika main upwas kaa sthaan antim he
 "satyagraha" is not only a retribution, but also a unique life system, at the core of which the fasting of non-violence, truth, apragya, astheya, fearlessness, brahmacharya, sarvadharma samabhav, etc
 are fast
 jiskaa vyaktigat jivan in vraton ke kaaran shuddh nahin he, vah sachcha satyagrahi nahin ho saktaa
 That is why Vinoba calls these fasts "satyagraha loyalty"
 "satyagrah' or "ni:shastr pratikaar' main utana hi antar he, jitna uttari or dakshini dhruv main
 Disarmament retaliation is conceived as a weapon of weakness and does not prohibit the use of violence to accomplish its purpose, whereas satyagraha is conceived as the weapon of the ultimate knight and in any form Does not have space for the use of violence
 is prakaar satyagrah niskriy sthiti nahin he
 It is a state of strong activism
 satyagrah ahimsak pratikaar he, parantu vah niskriy nahin he
 The question of injustice and retaliation for injustice is eternal
 apni sabhyataa ke vikascram main manushya ne pratikaar ke liye pramukhat: chaar paddatiyon kaa avlamban kiya he- The first method is more evil than evil
 is paddati se dandniti kaa janm hua jab isse samaaj or raashtra kii samasyaon ke niraakaran kaa prayaas hua to yuddh kii sanstha kaa vikaas hua
 The second method is to give appropriate punishment for evil, ie crime for evil, not more
 yah amaryadit pratikaar ko simit karne kaa prayaas he
 The third method is good for evil
 yah buddha, isa, gandhi aadi santon kaa maarg he
 It involves the element of non-violence in lieu of violence
 chauthi paddati he buraai kii upeksha
 Acharya Vinoba says- "do not resist evil, but help the opponent's proper thinking
 uske sadvichaar main sahakaar karo
 Our goal should be fulfilled only in pure thinking, thinking, implementing it in personal life and in explaining it to others
 samnevaale ke samyak chintan main madad dena hi satyagrah kaa sahi swaroop he
 'this is what Vinoba Satyagraha calls a mild and gentle process
 satyagrah prem kii prakriya he
 He should be growing in order, more and more
 satyagrah kuch nayaa nahin he, kautumbik jivan kaa raajnneetik jivan main prasar maatr he
 Gandhiji's contribution is that he used the idea of satyagraha collectively in political life
 kaha jaataa he
 In a democracy, where all the work is going on "from the opinion of the people", through the people's representatives, there is no place for Satyagraha
 vinoba kehete hai-vastav main samuhik satyagrah aavashyaktaa to us tantra' main nahin hogi, jisamen nirnay bahumat se nahin, sarvasammati se hoga
 But even in that case personal satyagraha can be done for the help of the neighbor in contemplation
 parantu loktantr main jab vichaarswatantry or vichaarpradhan ke liye puraa avasar he, to satyagrah ko kisi prakaar ke "dabaav, gheraav athwa band,' kaa rup nahin grahan karnaa chahie
 If this happens, the benignity of Satyagraha will be destroyed
 satyagrahi apane dharm se chyut ho jayega
 Today, the use of satyagraha and non-violent retaliation is going on continuously in different corners of the world
 dwitiya mahayuddh main hajaaron yudhvirohi paisefigt' sena main bharti hone ke bajaay jelon main gaye hai
 Philosophers such as Butrand Russell were locked behind prison doctrines due to anti-war satyagrahas
 anuastron ke kaarkaane aalder mastan se landan tak, prativarsh 60 mile kii padayatra kar hajaaron shantivaadee anushastron ke prati apana virodh prakat karte hai
 The story of the sacrifice of Negro leader Martin Luther King has become the immortal saga of the Satyagraha struggle
 italy ke danillo dolchi ke satyagrah kii kahani kisko romanchit nahin kar jaati
 All these efforts may not meet the test of Satyagraha, but these are definitely a step towards peace and non-violence
 satyagrah kaa rup antarrashtriya sangharsh main kaisaa hoga, iske vishay main acharya vinoba kehete hai-maan lijie, akramanakari hamaare gaanv main ghus jaataa he, to main kahoonga ki tum prem se aao-unase milane ham jaayenge, darenge nahin
 But if they want to do something wrong, then we will say to them, we cannot accept this thing - even if you finish us
 satyagrah ke is rup kaa prayog abhi antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye nahin hua he
 But if the power of non-violence is to be distinguished by overthrowing the power of violence, in order to protect human culture from the catastrophe of atomic age, there is no other path of retaliation other than this path of satyagraha
 is anuyug main shastr kaa pratikaar shastr se nahin ho saktaa
 But today's era has been told from where it is, it is not a blissful task at all
 america main essa kaha jaataa he kii "agar tumhe koi ek thappad mare to usase suuli pe chadha do " bhala ye bhi koi baat he ye to sara sar hinsha ko badhaava he or hamaare gadhiji kaha karte the kii "agar koi ek thappad mare to doosraa gaal de do ve khud sarama jaye ga" The 1989 European Cup final was a football match held on 24 May 1989 at Camp Nou in Barcelona, spain, in which Italy's Milan beat Romania's Stéo Bucuresti 4–0
 Two goals from Marco van Basten and Rude Gullit gave each Italian side their third win in the competition
 castella de aguada, jise bandra kile ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, mumbai main bandra kshetra main sthit ek durg he
 Castella is a variant of the Portuguese word castello
 iskaa sahi naam castelo de aguada hona chaiye, kintu iske nirmaataaon dwaara ise forte de bandora kaha gaya tha
 It is situated on the end of the land of Bandra Island
 1640 main portugaliyon ne ise pehre kii minar ke uddeshy se banaaya tha, kyonki yahaan se mahim kii khadi, arabi samudr or mahim ke dakshin dweep par acchhee najar rakhi ja sakati he
 Its strategic importance increased further in 1661 when the Portuguese ceded seven islands of the then Bombay to the British Emperor George II as a dowry
 durg ke naam se gyaat hota he ki vah sthaan jahaan taaja pani ek fawwaare ke rup main uplabdh tha 
 This wool was for Portuguese ships that were present for the coasts in the early period

 dablyuyu-14 america raksha mantralay pentagon kaa ek chini prayogtmak hypersonic missile ke liye code naam tha, jise ab deef-jedef kaha jaataa he
 The DF-ZF is a hypersonic missile delivery vehicle that was flight tested seven times by China on 9 January, 7 August and 2 December 2014, 7 June and 27 November 2015, and again in April 2016
 chini raksha mantralay ne janvari 2014 kii apane pareekshan kii pushti kii or kaha ki yah pareekshan "vaigyanik" prakruti main tha, haalanki ise vyapak rup se ek vyapak chini sainya bild-ap ke hisse ke rup main dekha gaya he
 According to US officials of the Washington Free Beacon, all seven tests conducted so far have been successful
 sabhi pareekshanon ko china ke mukhya missile pareekshan centre shanksi praant main sthit taiyuan upgrah prakshepan centre main kiye gayi
 The DF-ZF hypersonic missile is reportedly capable of reaching speeds between Mach 5 and Mach 10
 jine ke dephence vikali or anya logon ke anusaar, deef-jedef kaa upyog parmaanu hathiyaaron ke vitaran ke liye kiya ja saktaa tha lekin iskaa upyog sateek-strike bam girane ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he, jo ek america vaahak strike samooh ke starit vaayu suraksha ko barbaad kar saktaa he
 The DF-ZF is a dangerous weapon because the hypersonic glider vehicle is "virtually impossible to intercept by conventional missile defense systems, which track incoming objects via satellite sensors and ground, sea radar
" " kuch sutron ke mutabik, chini deef-jedef kaarykram main ek kamajori ucch pradarshan vaali computing shakti kii kami he, jo dizin taiyaar karti he
 However, the Chinese supercomputer has named the world's top 2 fastest systems in the Top 500 list of 2016 and China is similar to the US in all supercomputer installations
 aisi reporton ke baavjood, yah kaarykram saat launch ke saath aage badhata ja rahaa he, jo sabhi 2016 tak safal rahe
 The hypersonic glider vehicle has a relatively low chance of being hit by an anti-ballistic missile compared to conventional re-carrier vehicles
 saamaanya punah vaahak vaahan vaataavaran belistic prakshepvakr par utarate hai
 Hence their path can be easily detected
 lekin hypersonic glyder vaahan kaa path tay nahin hota he or isaki gaati main bahut adhik hoti he
 Therefore, the chances of firing by an anti ballistic missile are very less
 glyder vahno kaa path kabhi bhi badla ja saktaa he yahi ise maar giraane main mushkil banaati he
 Hypersonic vehicles like the WU-14 can be mounted in various Chinese ballistic missiles, making it even more dangerous
 jaise china ko yadi america par hypersonic missile se prahaar karnaa he to vah pehle apni 8000 kimi vaali belistic missile main hypersonic vaahan ko bhejega or america par pahuchane se purv belistic missile se hypersonic vaahan ko alag kar degaa
 And will increasingly attack American Thikano
 hypersonic vaahan kii tej gati ke kaaran america ise roak nahin paaegaa
 Analysts are skeptical that the WU-14 will be used in low-range roles to solve the problem of hitting the moving target with the first anti-ship missile and a ballistic missile for other strategic purposes
 dirghakaalik lakshyon main america ke khilaaf ranneetik bambaari yaa anya deshon kii sambhaavna ke saath america ke missile kshamtaaon kaa pratirodh bhi isame shaamil ho sakate hai
 Because of which the US is emphasizing on the development of director-energy weapons, because the director-energy weapon makes it possible for a hypersonic glider vehicle to fall

 If we say "the flow of time is a continuum" then in English it will be called "the flow of time forms a continuum"

 Dante Alligieri was a medieval Italian poet
 ye virgil ke baad italy ke sabase mahaan kavi kahe jate hai
 He was also the President of Italy
 unka suprasiddh mahakavy divine kamedia apane dhang kaa anupam pratik mahakavy he
 Additionally, his lyrical Vita Nyuova, meaning New Life, is a collection of poignant poems, in which he recounts the love story of his beloved Sitrice and the poignant viraha tale on his death in 23 years
 inkaa janm europe main, italy main hua tha
 They were citizens of Florence
 unka parivaar pracheen tha, phir bhi ucchwargeey nahin tha
 He was born at a time when a revival of medieval ideology and culture was beginning
 raajnneeti ke vichaaron or kala sambandhi manyataon main bhi parivartan ho rahaa tha
 Dante is considered the best poet of Italy, in relation to which the English poet Shelley has said that, dante kaa kavy us sethu ke samaan he jo kaal kii dhara par bana he or pracheen vishwa ko aadhunik vishwa se milaataa he
 Dante wrote his epic in simple colloquial Italian language, not writing in Latin language, and made his mother tongue and popular language proud with his great works
 yah kaary tulsidas ke ramcharitamanas ke bhashaa main likhane ke samaan tha
 In fact, this time was the time for the movement of the prestige of Lokbhasha all over the world
 bharat main bhi ramanand, gyaneshwar, namdev, vidyapati, kabir, sur, tulsidas, ityadi ne isi prakaar lokbhasha main sahitya rachana kaa aandolan kiya
 In fact, this work of Dante was a conch shell of epochal change
 italvi bhashaa main divine kamedia dwaara dante kaa sthaan amar he
 Dante was not only a poet and thinker, he was also a political leader and administrator
 unhone florence rajya par shashan bhi kiya
 But his art and poetry ideas are found in his work De Vulgari Eloquyo
 ve utkrisht kavita se hi santusht naa hokar yah bhi bataate hai, ki sarvotkrisht kavita kin baton par nirbhar karti he
 He made a revolutionary effort against Greek and Latin traditions by giving subjects like love and folklore the importance of his works
 dante ke vichaar se parishthit saushthavpurn bhashaa, uttam abhivyanjana style tathaa upyukt vishaywastu kaa saamanjasy hone par hi shreshth rachana sambhav ho sakati he
 In this way, Dante has composed his poetry by choosing the best words from the lingua franca and also from the figurative language, except for the words Bhadde and Rustic for best composition
 de valgari elocuo granth kii jorge centsbari ne bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii he
 After Dante, in Italy, such an important poetry thinker did not occur before Croche
 aaligyari daante kii greek tathaa laathini sahitya ke sivaa dharmavigyaan main bhi uski vishesh ruchi thi
 In politics, he was a follower and supporter of the soft party, but when its side was defeated by the revolutionary party of Guelph in 1301, Dante and his comrades had to bear the penalty of exile
 is sajaa ke baad durbhaagya se yadi vah florentine sarkaar ke haath pakad liya jaataa to uske jivit jala die jane tak kii sambhaavna thi
 From this time till death, he wandered from one place to another and from third to third like a pilgrim or almost like a beggar
 in dinon uski sthiti patavarviheen nauka kii tarah ho gai thi
 Stumbling rate upon rate, he experienced with great bitterness how tasteless the bread of another's house was and how much pain he felt in climbing the stairs of a foreign house
 san 1316 main florens kii ore se saarvajaneen rajakshamaa kii ghoshnaa kii gai or kinhin apmanjanak sharton par use florence lautne kii anumati bhi di gai
 He turned it down and decided to live on his way to the end
 san 1321 main ravenna main uski mrityu hui or vahiin vah dafnaaya gaya
 Ravenna officials are still unwilling to return her body to her native land, who had treated her with such scorn
 daante ke jivan ke saath do striyon ke naam ghanishtha rup se sambanddh hai
 One is Biatris Portinari and the other is Gemya Donati
 pehali uski yuvavastha kii preyasi thi jise usne us sam dekha tha jab vah keval nau varsh kii thi
 Even after Biatrice married Simon de Bardy and died within a short time in 1290, the teeth remained in his affection
 duusari mahila, jemya, uski vivaahita patni thi jiske saath uskaa vivaah san 1277 main hua tha
 She did not support Teeth when he was exiled
 spasht he ki daante uske vyavhaar or rang dhang se santusht na tha or baad main sambhavat: usase ghrinaa bhi karne laga tha
 For the convenience of tooth creations, we can divide it into three parts or periods
 pratham bhaag main ve kritiyaan rakhi ja sakati hai jinamein yauvan kaa utsaah or biatris ke prati uske utkar anuraag kaa dharmik roopantaran drushtigochar hota he
 Its duration can be roughly considered from 1283 to 1290
 is kaal kii sabase mukhya rachana vita nuova he
 The second part begins after the death of Viratris
 iskaa vistaar 1291 se 1313 tak rakhaa ja saktaa he
 During this period, his life was temporarily dominated by despair, sorrow and faith, and his inclination became more and more towards philosophy and science
 vah raajnneetik jhagadon kii katutaa main ek daanv pechon yaa yojanaon main lipt hota gaya
 The main compositions of this period are The Convivio, The Monarchia, The Epicles etc
 samrat henry saptam se daante ne badi badi aashaaq band rakhi thi jinpar uski mrityu ne pani pher diya
 All his plans ended abruptly, but the reward was that he could not defeat him completely
 usne ek baar phir aadhyatmik santulan kii ore kadam badhaayaa
 The ideas and beliefs of youth resurfaced in him and he became even more strongly oriented towards the worship of the Holy Spirit of the late Biatris
 'divine kamedi' kii kitni hi kavitaaon main iske pramaan bikhare pade hai
 This third period of tooth creations can be considered from 1314 to 1321, till the time of his death
 'di vita nuova' ko ham italy ke pratham premakavy kii sangya de sakate hai
 In this, we get a glimpse of the psychological analysis of the said feelings of the poet
 biatris ke pratham darshan ke baad hi kis tarah uske nae jivan kaa aarambh hua, uske hriday main kis tarah kram kram se is nari ke saundarya evam maadhurya kii bhaavana prabalatar haati gai, dhire dhire vah kis tarah uski aashaaon tathaa prem-bhakthi-upasna kaa centre banati gai, usee mrityu par use kitni maansik vednaa or akulata hui or kis prakaar uskaa parthiv prem ant main divya bhakthi ev poojabhaav main parinat hota gaya, isaki manoram jhaanki is kavy main dekhi ja sakati he
 After the death of Biatris, his attention shifted to the idyllic feelings, thoughts and selfishness for a few years, and he began to eat in the midst of disappointments or doubts
 yah ham uski duusari rachana 'conbivon' main dekh sakate hai
 In both these compositions, where and when Biotrice appears to be a statue of a supernatural beauty, and where it looks like a divine shadow from a philosophical or religious point of view, it is unnecessary to discuss it
 itnaa hi kahana alam hoga ki 'vita nuova' saamaanya premgautha na hokar ek ucch satviktaa ev shraddha kii ore kavi kaa maansik unnayan he
 There is no doubt that despite the many contradictions of hope despair, the heart of the tooth seems to be conscious of its recurrence
 vastut: kavy ke antim bhaag se hi abhas milane lagata he ki kavi ke maanas chakshu par us parloukik jagat kii chaaya padani aarambh ho chuki thi jiskaa centrebindu biatris hi thi or jiskaa paripaak uske 'divine kamedi' naamak kavy main hua
 Among the Latina compositions of teeth, 'de Monarchia' is particularly notable
 isamen dikhalaayaa gaya he ki samrajya kii aavashyakt ek tarah se ishvarsamarthit he
 They depict the separate territories of state and church or religious institution and emphasize that the power of the Pope should be confined to religious matters only
 use patrasangrah 'ipicills' main se bhi kai patron main isi aashay ke vichaar prakat kiye gaye hai
 There was a lot of criticism in the opposition in favor of Dante, whose fame was sometimes seen as being smeared
 phir bhi isamen andeh nahin ki vah mahaan kavi tha jisane apane parvarti anek kaviyon tathaa sahityakaron ko vyapak rup se prabhavit kiya
 With the passage of time, many scholars and thinkers have praised him very much, which helps in giving him a very high place among the writers and poets of the world today

 They are often 12–20 inches long rectangular
 ye dhanagar ek samvahak dand se latakate rahete hai or icchaanusaar upar neeche kiye ja sakate hai
 The electrolytes carry the dissolved cryolite inside the cell and the electromagnet controls such that the cryolite remains in an evenly damped state by the heat of its flow

 It is one of the five known species of the monotreme gan of mammals, who, as mammals, feed their infants, but in which the mother lays eggs rather than conceive
 puure standhari samudaay main ande dene vaali keval yahi paanch jatiyaan he
 This is very important in terms of evolution because these species are a sign of a time when mammals were developing new and they did not have the capacity to develop babies in the womb

 When European biologists first saw the dead body of a platypus in 1999, they refused to accept the existence of such a creature by seeing its duck-like snout, thick beaver-like beaver and beaver-like legs and the organs of different beings
 Accused of cheating by adding
 platipus un bahut kam stanadhariyon main se he jo vish se apni raksha kar sakate hai
 a thorn is formed on the heel of the hind legs of the male platypus which can be dug up and injected venom into another creature
 yadi maanav ko yah lag jaae to aamtaur par mrityu to nahin hoti lekin bhayankar peeda avashya hoti he
 It is believed that as Platypus had a tendency to lay eggs like reptiles, the trend of poisoning continued

 Except for dolphins, monotreme are the only mammals that have the power of electromagnetism, that is, they can sense the power used in the muscles of their grass animals

 It has been observed in experiments that if an artificial shrimp is extracted from it, the platypus tries to catch it and ignores it without electricity

 Informally, this means that an irrational number cannot be represented as a simple fraction
 udhaaharan ke liye 2 kaa vargamul, or pai aparimey sankhyaayein hai
 It can be proved that irrational numbers are typically real numbers that cannot be represented as terminals or continuous decimals, although mathematicians do not take this as a definition
 cantre pramaan ke parinamswaroop ki vaastavik sankhyaayein agananeey hai yah maanata he ki lagbhag sabhi vaastavik sankhyaayein aparimey hai
 Perhaps, the most well known irrational numbers are π, e and √2
when the ratio of the length of two line segments is irrational, the line segments are also described as incommensurable, they do not share any measure in common
 In this sense the measure of a line segment l is a line segment j whose "measure" is l in the sense that the number of all copies of j from one end to the other end achieves the same length as l

 The first evidence for the existence of irrational numbers is generally attributed to a Pythagorean who probably discovered them while identifying the sides of the pentagram
 us vakt ke maujuuda pithagoriai paddati ne daawa kiya hota ki vahaan zarur aisi koi paryaapt choti, avibhajya ikai he jo in lambaai main se ek or anya main samaan rup se feet baith sakati he
 However, the fifth century BC
 Hippasus was able to deduce that there is in fact no common unit of measurement and that the assertion of such an existence is indeed a contradiction
 usne yah pradarshit karte hue aisa kiya kii vah asambhav he jo yah dwaara kiya pradarshan he ki agar ek sam trikon samdvibahu kaa karn vastav main ek bahu se anupatik he, to maap kii us ikai ko sam or visham, donon hona chahie jo ki asambhav he
 His reasoning is as follows: unani ganitagyon ne asammey pariman ke is anupaat ko alogos athwa varnanaatit kaha

 According to another legend, Hippasus was exiled only for this revelation
 hipasus ko khud jo bhi parinaam bhugatne pade hon, uski khoj ne paithagorian ganit ke samaksh ek bahut gambhir samasya khadi kar di, kyonki isane is dharna ko dhwast kar diya ki sankhya or jyamiti aviyojya hai-unke siddhant kaa aadhaar
 Theodorus of Siren proves the irrationality of the radicals up to 17, but stayed there perhaps because the algebra he used could not be applied to the square root of 17
 And when Eudoxus developed the theory of proportions In which irrational as well as rational ratios were taken care of, then only a strong mathematical foundation of irrational numbers was created
 a magnitude "was not a number, but was for existence such as line segment, angle, area, volume and time which we can say can be continuously varied
 pariman, sankhyaon ke vipareet the, jo ek maan se duusare maan main uchhal rahe the, jaise 4 se 5 par
 sankhyaayein kuch nunatam, avibhajya ikai se bani hoti hai, jabaki pariman aparimit rup se kam karne yogya hai
 Because no quantitative values were assigned to the magnitude, Eudoxus was able to compute both proportions and incommensurable ratios, for which he assigned a ratio as an equivalence between the two ratios in terms of its magnitude and proportionality

 He used them freely but interpreted them in geometric terms as follows: rekhaon ke rup main pariman kii euclid kii avadharana ke vipareet, al-mahani ne purnank or bhinn ko parimey pariman ke rup main mana or varg mul or ghan mul ko aparimey pariman ke rup main

 jyeshthadev ne yuktibhaasha main in anant shrinkhalaaon ke liye pramaan uplabdh karaae hai
 The 17th century saw imaginary numbers becoming a powerful tool in the hands of Abraham de Mover, and especially Leonard Euler
 The completion of the theory of complex numbers in the nineteenth century required the differentiation of irrationals into algebraic and transcendental numbers, proof of the existence of transcendental numbers, and the revival of scientific studies of irrational theory that has been largely ignored since Euclid

 Weierstrass's method was fully pursued by Selvatore Pincherley in 1880, and Dedekind's method gained additional prominence through the author's later works and the support of Paul Tenry

 Lambert proved that π cannot be rational and said that en will be irrational if n is rational
 While Lambert's evidence is often called incomplete, modern assessments support it as satisfactory and in fact it is unusually rigorous for its time

 The existence of the transcendental number was first established by Leauville
 Later, Georg Kanter proved their existence in a different way, showing that every interval in real consists of transcendental numbers

 The square root of all non-square natural numbers is irrational and a proof can be seen in quadratic irrationals
 2 ke vargamul kii aparimeyata use parimey maanate hue or ek virodhabhas kaa nishkarsh nikaalte hue siddh kii ja sakati he, jise ridkshio aid absrdam dwaara ek tark kaha jaataa he
 The following argument appeals twice to the fact that the square of an odd integer is always odd
 yadi √2 parimey he, to purnank m,n ke liye iskaa rup m / n he, jahaan donon sam nahin hai
 Then m 2 = 2n 2, so m is even, say m = 2p
 Thus 4p 2 = 2n 2 therefore 2p 2 = n 2 so n is even, which is a contradiction
 do ke vargamul ke liye uparyukt saboot ko ankaganit ke moulik prameya ke upyog dwaara samanyikrut kiya ja saktaa he, jise 1798 main gaus dwaara sabit kiya gaya tha
 This reinforces that every integer has unique factorization in the prime
 iskaa istemaal karte hue ham yah dikhaa sakate hai ki yadi ek parimey sankhya ek purnank nahin he to uskaa koi abhinn ghaat ek purnank nahin ho saktaa he, kyonki apane nunatam pad main har main ek gunankhand hona chahie jo ganak se vibhajit nahin hota chaahe donon hi kisi bhi ghaat tak badha die jaaen
 isliye agar ek purnank, ek anya purnank kaa sateek k waan ghaat nahin he to uskaa k waan varg aparimey he
 The numbers that are most easily proved to be irrational are some special logarithms
 yahaan ridkshio aid absrdam dwaara ek saboot he ki log2 3 aparimey he
 Note that log2 3 ≈ 1
58> 0
 maan lijiye ki log2 3 parimey he
 For some positive integers m and n, we have iskaa matlab he ki However, the number 2 that is raised to any positive integer power must be even and the number 3 that is raised to any positive integer power must be odd
 Obviously, an integer cannot be both even and odd at the same time: we have a contradiction
 jo ekmaatr anumaan hamane lagaaya tha vah tha ki log2 3 parimey he 
 virodhabhas kaa matlab he ki yah dharna zarur galat hogi, yani log2 3 aparimey he or ise kabhi bhi purnank m / n ke ek bhagfal ke rup main vyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa he jahaan n ≠ 0 he
 Cases like log10 2 can also be treated in a similar way
 lagbhag sabhi aparimey sankhyaayein abijiy hai or sabhi abijiy sankhyaayein aparimey hai: abijiy sankhya vaala lekh kai udaahranon ko soochibaddh karata he
 er and πr are irrational if r ≠ 0 is rational; e π is irrational
 aparimey sankhya ko nirmit karne kaa doosraa tarika he aparimey bijiy sankhya ke rup main nirmaan, yani purnank gunank ke saath bahupad ke shunya ke rup main: bahupad sameekaran ke saath shuru kijiye Where the coefficients ai are integers
 maan lijie aap jaanate hai ki kuch vaastavik sankhyaayein x maujuud hai jahaan p = 0 
 is bahupad sameekaran kaa ekmaatr sambhavit parimey mul r / s swaroop main hoga jahaan r, a 0 kaa ek bhaajak he or s, a n kaa ek bhaajak he; aise keval simit ummidavaar hai jise aap sirf haathon se jaanch sakate hai
 If neither of them is a root of p, then x must be irrational
 udhaaharan ke liye, is takanic kaa istemaal yah dikhaane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki x = 1 / 3 aparimey he: hamaare paas he 2 = 2 or isliye x 6 - 2x 3 - 1 = 0 or is baad vaale bahupad main koi parimey mul nahin he 
 Because algebraic numbers constitute a region, many irrational numbers can be constructed by combining algebraic and transcendental numbers
 udhaaharan ke liye 3π + 2, π + √2 or e √3 aparimey hai 
 The decimal expansion of an irrational number never repeats or ends unlike a rational number
 yah darshane ke liye, maan lijiye ham n purnank ko m dwaara bhaag dete hai 
 jab m dwaara n ke bhaag par deergh bhaag ko lagu kiya jaataa he, to keval m sheshfal sambhav hote hai
 If 0 appears as a remainder, the decimal expansion ends
 yadi 0 kabhi prakat nahin hota to vah elgorithm, kisi bhi sheshfal ko ek baar se adhik upyog naa karte hue adhik se adhik m - 1 charan chal saktaa he
 After that, a remainder must recur and then the decimal expansion repeats
 iske vipareet, maan lijiye hamaare saamne ek aavarti dashamalav aata he, to ham siddh kar sakate hai ki vah do purnankon kaa bhinn he
 for example: yahaan repitend kii lambaai 3 he
 We multiply by 103: dhyaan den ki jab hamane 10 ke ghaate dohraye jane vaale bhaag kii lambaai se guna kiya, to hamane ankon ko dashamalav bindu ke bain ore thik utane hi sthanon se sthanantarit kiya
 Therefore, the back end of 1000A exactly matches the back end of A
 yahaan, donon 1000A or a ke sire main 162 doharaav he
 Therefore, when we subtract a from both sides, the back end of 1000A cancels out from the rear end of A: phir 
 Alternatively, since 0
5 = 1 / 2, a person can clear the fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2: 
 The last line, 53 / 74, is a quotient of integers and is therefore a rational number
 yahaan ek prasiddh shuddh astitv yaa gaiyr-rachanaatmak pramaan he: There exist two irrational numbers a and b, such that ab is rational
 vastav main, agar √2√2 parimey he, tab maaniye ki a = b = √2
 anyathaa, maan lijiye ki a aparimey sankhya √2√2 he or b = √2
 to phir a b = √2 = 2√2·√2 = √22 =2 jo parimey he
 Although the above argument does not decide between the two cases, the Gelfond – Schneider theorem implies that √2√2 is transcendental, hence irrational
 yah gyaat nahin he ki kya π + e athwa π - e aparimey he yaa nahin
 In fact, there is no pair of non-zero integers m and n about which m π + ne is irrational or not
 iske alaava, yah gyaat nahin he ki set q par bijganit ke anusaar swatantra he yaa nahin
 It is not known whether 2e, πe, π√2, the Catalan constant, or the Euler – Meshcheroni gamma constant γ are irrational
 chunki vaastavik ek agananeey set kaa gathan karte hai, jinamein se parimey ek gananeey subset hote hai, aparimey kaa poorak seppeganneey he
 In the ordinary remote verb d = | x - y |, the real number is a metric space and therefore also a topological space
 euclidian sudur kriya ko simit karne se aparimey ko ek metric spes kii sanrachana milti he
 Since the subspace of the irrationals is not closed, the triggered metric is not complete
 haalanki, ek purna metric sthaan main G-delta set hote hue - arthath khule subset kaa ek gananeey pratichhedan - aparimey kaa sthaan sansthitiki rup se purna he: arthath, aparimey par ek metric he jo thik waisi hi sansthitiki ko utprerit karata he jaisaa ki euclidian metric kaa pratibandh karata he, lekin jiske sambandh main aparimey purna hai
 One can also see this by being ignorant of the fact mentioned above about the G-delta set: the continuous fraction expansion of an irrational number defines a homomorphism from the place of the irrational to the position of all positive integers, which is easily complete The form is seen to be metric
 iske alaava, sabhi aparimey ke set, kate hue ek metric-yogya sthaan hai
 In fact, the irrational has the basis of the klopen set so the space is zero-dimensional

 alexander graham bel ko puri duniya aamtaur par telephone ke avishkaarak ke rup main hi zyada jaanati he
 Very few people know that Graham Bell has made many more useful inventions not only in telephone, but also in the field of communication technology
 optical-fibre system, photophone, bel or decible unit, metal-detector aadi ke avishkaar kaa shrey bhi unhen hi jaataa he
 All these are based on such technology, without which communication revolution can not be imagined
 graham bel kaa janm scotland ke edinburgh main 3 march san 1847 ko hua tha
 Graham Bell's prodigious talent can be gauged from the fact that he graduated at the age of thirteen
 yah bhi behad aashcharya kii baat he ki ve keval solah saal kii umr main ek behtareen mujeec teacher ke rup main mashhoor ho gaye the
 Disability is nothing less than a curse for anyone, but Graham Bell did not let the disability become a curse
 darasal, graham bel kii maa badhir thim
 Graham Bell was deeply saddened and disappointed by her mother's inability to listen, but never let her disappointment hinder her path to success
 unhone apni niraashaa ko ek sakaaratmak mod dena hi behatar samajha
 This was the reason that he managed to make such an instrument for people unable to listen with the help of sound science, which is still no less than a boon for deaf people
 agar yah kahen ki graham bel ne apana puraa jivan badhir logon ke liye kaary karne main laga diya, to shaayad galat nahin hoga
 His mother was deaf, unable to hear Graham Bell's wife and a special friend of his
 chunki unhone shuru se hi aise logon kii takalif ko kaaphi kareeb se mahasoos kiya tha, isliye unke jivan kii behatari ke liye or kya kiya janaa chahie, ise ve behatar dhang se samaj sakate the
 It is possible that Graham Bell could have succeeded in inventing the telephone because of these special circumstances of his life
 graham bel bachapan se hi dhwani vigyaan main gahari dilchaspee rakhte the, isliye lagbhag 23 saal kii umr main hi unhone ek aisa piano banaaya, jisaki madhur aawaaj kaaphi dur tak suni ja sakati thi
 For some time he was also a teacher in the subject of speech technology
 is dauraan bhi unhone apana prayaas jari rakhaa or ek aise yantra ko banane main safal hue, jo na keval musical nots ko bhejne main sakasham tha, balki articulet spich bhi de saktaa tha
 This was the oldest model of telephone

 The Unnao Gold Treasure event took place in October 2013 in Sangrampur village of Unnao district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh

 The government was able to persuade the Ministry of Mining and the Archaeological Survey of India to excavate this allegedly buried gold treasure

 The Communist Party of India is a communist party in India

 The Indian Communist Party was founded by MN Rai

 The General Secretary of this party S
 Sudhakar Reddy
 yah bharat kii sabase puraani communist party he
 It is recognized as a national party by the Election Commission
 yah dal 'new age' kaa prakaashan karata he
 The youth organization of this team is 'all India Youth Federation'
 2004 ke sansadeey chunaav main is dal ko 5 434 738 mat mili
 The party won only 4 seats in the 2009 parliamentary election
 2014 ke sansadeey chunaav main dal ko maatr 1 siten mili There is some dispute over the date of establishment of CPI in the Communist movement
 khud bhakpa kaa maananaa he ki uskaa gathan 25 disambar 1925 ko kanpur main hui party congress main hua tha
 But the Communist Party of Marxist, which was formed after the partition of the party in 1964, believes that the party was formed in 1920
 makapa ke daawey ke anusaar bharat kii is sabase puraani communist party kaa gathan 17 oktober 1920 ko communist international kii duusari congress ke turant baad hua tha
 However, it can be said that since 1920 the process of formation of the party was going on and many groups also emerged in this regard
 lekin aupchaarik rup se 1925 main hi party kaa gathan hua
 Among its early leaders were Manvendra Nath Rai, Abani Mukherjee, Mohammad Ali and Shafiq Siddiqui
 shuruaati daur main party kii jaden majboot karne kii koshish main em

 raay ne desh ke duusare hisson main sakriy communist samoohon se sampark kiya
 There were small communist groups in many cities of the country, but not all of them became part of the CPI
 1920 or 1930 ke dashak ke dauraan party kaa sanghathan kamazor haalat main rahaa
 Even before the CPI was formally formed, the British had filed a lawsuit against several active communists under the Kanpur Bolshevik conspiracy

 raay, es

 daange sahit kai communiston par rajdroh ke aarope lagaaye gayi
 This made the communists famous and for the first time common people in India came to know about them
 20 march 1929 ko bhakpa se jude bahut se mahatvapurn netaaon ko meerut shadyantra cese main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 As a result, the party became leaderless
 1933 main pramukh netaaon ke meerut shadyantra cese se reeha hone ke baad party kaa punargathan kiya gaya
 Its Central Committee was formed and in 1934 it was accepted as the Indian part of Communist International
 1934 main congress ke bheetar vampanthi rujhaan rakhane vaale netaaon ne congress socialist party kaa gathan kiya
 At the time of its formation, the CPI leaders called it 'social fascism'
 lekin comintern dwaara upniveshon main bhartiya rashtriya congress jaise dalon ke prati drushtikon badalane se bhakpa ke congress ke prati drushtikon main bhi badlaav aayaa
 Now the CPI began to consider Congress politics as progressive
 iske sadasyon ne congress kii vampanthi dhara arthath siespi kii sadsyta grahan kii
 During 1936–1937, mutual cooperation between the Socialists and Communists increased considerably
 janvari 1936 main siespi kii duusari congress main yah thisis sweekaar kii gayi ki marxvad-leninavaad ke aadhaar par ek sanyukt bhartiya socialist party kii sthapana kii aavashyaktaa he
 Likewise, many communists were included in the National Executive Committee formed after the Third Congress of CSP
 baharhaal, yah nazadiiki lambe samay tak nahin chal paayi
 In the Ramgarh session of the Congress in 1940, the CPI released a document titled 'proletarian Path'
 isamen yudgh ke kaaran aupniveshik rajya kii kamazor haalat kaa hawala dete hue uske kilaaf sashastr andolan chhedane kii baat kii
 Enraged by this one-sided announcement of the CPI, the CSP expelled the Communist members from his party
 is bich, dwitiya vishwa-yudgh main soviet union or britain ke sambandhon ke achche hone ke kaaran july, 1942 main is par lagi pabandi hataa di gayi
 It started opposing Congress's anti-colonial strategy
 isane 1942 ke bharat chodo andolan kii aalochana kii or subhash chandra bose kii tikhi ninda kii
 An important achievement of the CPI in this period was also that it had established its supremacy over the All India Trade Union Congress, the trade organization of the Congress
 bhakpa ne 1946 main hue prantiy chunaavon main bhagidaari kii lekin ise puure desh ke 1585 prantiy vidhansabha kii siton main se kul aath siton par jeet mili
 Since its formation till the independence of the country, there have been many ups and downs in CPI politics
 isane ek samay congress or mahatma gandhi ko pratikriyaavaadi kii sangya di
 He also worked closely with them and separated from them again and opposed their politics
 yah virodh is seemaa tak pahunch gaya ki unhone bharat chodo andolan ke samay british shashan kaa samarthan kar daalaa
 One of the main reasons behind this was that Indian conditions were given less importance in CPI politics
 adhikansh maukon par communist international yaa soviet union ke nirdeshon ne party kii ranneeti tay karne kaa kaam kiya
 Due to this many times its strategies moved in the opposite direction
 in gadabadiyon ke baavjood congress ke mazdoor sanghathan or desh ke kuch bhaagon main isaki sthiti kaafii majboot ho gayi thi
 Communists also played an important role in the Tebhaga movement in Bengal and the Telangana movement in Andhra Pradesh
 1946 main hue tebhaaga andolan main bengal ke jotdaaron ne is baat ke liye sangharsh kiya ki unke paas apni kheti ke utpaada kaa do-tihaai bhaag hona chahie
 The Kisan Morcha Kisan Sabha of the CPI played an important role in this movement
 kuch jagahon par yah andolan hinsak bhi ho gaya
 The movement was successful and the Muslim League government of the state enacted a law that landlords would not be given more than one-third of the total produce
 lekin yah kanoon sahi tareeke se lagu nahin hua
 The Telangana movement took place in Hyderabad Rajwada
 yahan andhra mahasabha ke binar tale hyderabad ke nizaam ke kilaaf pehle hi andolan chal rahaa tha
 Communists had a significant presence in the Andhra General Assembly
 inhone kisaanon ko nizaam or sthaneey zameendaaron ke kilaaf jaagruk banaaya
 In Nalgonda, Warangal and Khammam districts, farmers launched agitations for loan waiver, abolition of bonded labor and redistribution of land
 yah andolan 1945 main shuru hua or 1946 aate-aate isane kaafii jor pakad liya
 The Nizam's armies and zamindars were brutally repressed
 hazaron kisaanon kii hatya kar di gayi
 But the armed squads of the farmers fiercely countered this repression
 in daston kaa bahut se gaanvon par niyantran ho gaya or unhone vahaan bhoomi sudhaar kii nitiyon par amal kiya
 By 1948, he had liberated about 16,000 square miles of land in 3,000 villages and distributed it among the people of the village
 sitambar, 1948 main bhartiya sena ke dabil se nizaam ke shashan kaa ant ho gaya
 Despite this the peasant revolt continued
 bhartiya sena ne bhi iskaa hinsak daman kiya
 Eventually, the movement was officially withdrawn by the CPI in 1951
 iske baad yah andolan dhimaa padate hue khatm ho gaya
 Tebhaga and Telangana movement have significant importance in the history of Indian Left
 isane jamini str par communiston ke prabhaav ko dikhaaya
 Currently all groups of communists claim the legacy of these movements
 bharat kii azaadi ke samay azaadi or bhartiya rajya kii prakruti ke bare main bhakpa main gahan or rochak vaad-vivaad hua
 That is why the party did not participate in the Constituent Assembly either

 He emphasized that the transfer of power is genuine and that the Nehru government gave a clear indication that it represented anti-imperialist forces
 isliye unhone aagrah kiya ki bhakpa ko congress ke bare main apane vichaaron kaa punarmoolyankan karnaa chahie
 But it did not get enough support within the party
 bi
tii
 randive ke netritv main ek keme ne yah tark diya ki bharat main jan-vidroh jor pakad rahaa he
 Therefore, the CPI can try to capture power through the armed struggle of the workers throughout the nation by combining democratic and socialist phases
 party ke bheetar kuch logon ne telugana anubhav kii tulana china main maao ke sangharsh se kii or bhartiya rajya ke kilaaf lok-yudgh chhedane kii vakaalat kii
 This was called the 'andhra line'
 1948 kii kalakatta congress main randive line kii jeet hui
 But on the other hand, by allowing the armed suppression of the Telangana movement in India by the Nehru government and on the other hand the success of the Chinese Revolution, the 'andhra line' position in the party became stronger
 iske chalate 1950 main andhra ke netaa si
 rajeshwar raav ne party kaa netritv sambhaala
 But within the party P
C
 Joshi Khemé described such a move as leftist deviation
 is keme ne ‘aankh muundakar’ or kattar tareeke se chini raste kaa anusaran karne kii aalochana kii
 Joshi, analyzing the Indo-foreign policy of the Nehru government, tried to prove that it has an anti-imperialist tendency
 party ke is aantarik vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye party ke kuch varisht netaa masco gayi or vahaan ke communist party netaaon se lambi charchaa kii
 After this, three documents were prepared
 in dastavezon main yah spasht kiya gaya ki bharat ek nirbhar or ardh-aupniveshik desh he or nehru sarkaar zameendaaron, bade ekadhikaaravaadi burjwa or british samrajyavad ke hiton ko puraa kar rahi he
 Explaining the nature of Indian Burzwa, it was said that despite being primarily dependent on imperialist Burzwa, it has nationalist and non-cooperative elements
 iske baad madhyamargi netaa ajay ghosh ne party kii kaman sambhaali
 During this period the party recognized the independence of India and it was decided to participate in the elections, accepting the constitution
 pehle aam chunaavon main party kaa pradarshan bahut shandaar nahin mana ja saktaa, lekin loksabhaa main 16 siton par jeet hasil karke yah mukhya vipakshi dal ke rup main ubhari
 The CPI particularly focused on strengthening its position among the workers working in the organized sector
 iske mazdoor sanghathan ol india trade union congress kii mazaduron ke bich main acchhee paith thi
 But at that time it was difficult to challenge the dominance of Congress and Nehru in the politics of the country
 phir bhi bhakpa ne kuch rajyon main apni sthiti majboot kar lee
 The Congress again got a clear majority in the second general elections, but the CPI seats also increased
 in chunaavon main ise 27 loksabhaa kshetron main jeet mili
 After the 1957 assembly elections in Kerala, E

 The CPI government was formed under the leadership of Namboodiripad
 yah vishwa kii pehali chuni hui communist sarkaar thi
 But in 1959 the Nehru government dismissed it
 isse bhakpa ke ek dhade ke bheetar nehru ke prati kaafii naaraazgi paidaa ho gayi
 But the CPI activists were in a state of confusion at this time, because the Nehru government had a very good relationship with the Soviet Union
 soviet party kii yah apeksha thi ki bhakpa nehru sarkaar ke prati naram ravaiya apanaaye
 Meanwhile, such incidents took place at the international level due to which not only the international communist unity was affected, but the CPI was also divided
 saath kaa dashak aate-aate tak soviet union kii communist party or china kii communist party ke bich ke sambandh karaab hone lage
 The Communist Party of China accused the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of being a revisionist and had deviated from the path of marxism-leninism
 idhar china or bharat ke sambandh bhi kaafii karaab ho gayi
 The india-china war also took place in 1962 due to the border dispute
 bhakpa ke ek dhade ne bharat sarkaar kii niti kaa samarthan kiya
 At the same time another section of the party claimed that it is a confrontation between the socialist and the capitalist state
 asal main, bhakpa ke in dhadon kii ranneeti main antarrashtriya str par communiston ke bich chal rahi tanatani kii bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi
 The pro-soviet faction of the CPI took forward the idea of cooperating with the ruling National Party of India at that time
 lekin bhakpa ke ek duusare dhade, jo aage chalakar makapa bani, ne ise 'varg-sahyog' ke sanshodhanavaadee vichaar kii sangya di
 It is noteworthy that CPI won 29 seats in India's third general elections
 bhakpa ab bhi sansad main congress ke baad duusari sabase badi party thi
 But within a party's camp, the belief was reinforced that the CPI was not spreading due to lack of a strict attitude towards the Nehru government
 ek samay ke baad yah takaraav kaafii bad gaya
 The CPI split in 1964 and a new party CPI (M) emerged
 bhakpa ke kai jujharu netaa masalan namboodiripad, jyoti basu, harkishan singh surajeet aadi makapa main shaamil ho gayi
 This had a negative impact on the CPI basis in states like West Bengal
 kerala main party ke vibhaajan ke shuruaati kuch dashakon tak bhakpa kaa bhi acha-khaasaa prabhaav rahaa
 Between 1970-77, the CPI formed an alliance with the Congress and formed a government with it in which C
 Achutha Menon of the CPI became the Chief Minister of the state
 iske baad, kisi rajya main bhakpa ko satta main aane kaa mauka nahin mila
 The CPI supported Indira Gandhi's Emergency imposed by Congress due to alliance with Congress during 1970-77 period
 lekin assi kaa dashak aate-aate makapa zyaada majboot communist party ban gayi
 The CPI has a good presence in many other parts of the country, but the CPI (M) has gone ahead due to a stronger presence in some areas
 1977 ke baad bhakpa ne makapa or duusari choti communist partiyon ke saath milakar vam morche kaa gathan kiya
 In practically all places, including Kerala, this party turned into a smaller ally of the CPI (M)
 adhikansh maukon par iskaa pradarshan vam morche ke pradarshan par nirbhar rahaa
 In the later nineties, the CPI has given considerable attention to strengthening the politics of secular and non-bjp, non-congress parties
 makapa ke netritv vaale vam morche ke saath milakar isane congress kii nav-udaaravaadi nitiyon kaa virodh kiya
 No party got a majority after the 1996 Lok Sabha elections
 sabase badi party bhaajapa kii sarkaar loksabhaa main apana bahumat sabit nahin kar paayi
 After this, HD a United Front government was formed under the leadership of Deve Gowda
 bhakpa ne ek aitihaasik faisalaa lete hue is sarkaar main shaamil hone kaa faisalaa kiya
 This decision was quite different from the decision of the CPI (M) which rejected the proposal to make Jyoti Basu the Prime Minister
 is tarah vam morche kaa bhaag hote hue bhi isane apni raajnneetik swytta pradarshit kii
 Its leaders joined the government of both the governments of the United Front and they held important ministries like Home Ministry and Agriculture Ministry
 sanyukt morche kii sarkaar ke patan ke baad centre main rajg kii sarkaar bani
 During the tenure of this government, the CPI played the role of responsible opposition as a constituent of the Left Front
 2004 sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan kii sarkaar ko vam morche ne samarthan diya
 It tried to ensure that this government works according to its minimum common program
 is dauraan bhakpa ne bhi sarkaar par kai janonmukhi kaarykram apnaane kaa dabaav banaaya
 Observers have generally believed that the Left Front pressure played an important role behind the very progressive and people-oriented laws enacted during the UPA-I government
 2008 main vam morche ne sanyukt rajya america se parmaanu samjhaute ke mudde par samprag sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya
 The performance of the Left Front in the 2009 general elections was much worse than in the 2004 general elections
 iskaa kaaran tha ki pashchim bengal main vam morche ke pradarshan main aayi giravat
 In particular, in places like Singur and Nandigram, incidents of forced land acquisition by the state government and repression by use of force against it have severed the image of the Left Front
 iskaa asar bhakpa ke chunavi pradarshan par bhi padaa or ise loksabhaa main 2004 kii 10 kii tulana main sirf 4 siton par hi jeet mili
 Many limitations of CPI politics are now clear: First, the CPI has integrated itself into the politics of the Left Front in such a way that even on many serious issues it has not opposed the CPI-M more than a limit
 sirf kuch maukon par hi isane apni swaittata dikhaai he, lekin adhikansh masalon par isaki ranneeti vam morche kii ranneeti kaa bhaag hoti he
 Second, although the CPI (M) is in a very strong position in the three states of the country, the expansion of the CPI has been more in other parts of the country
 masalan, bihar, chhattisgarh, or tamilnadu jaise rajyon main bhi bhakpa kii majboot upasthiti rahi he
 But in states like Bihar, it has lost its base to a large extent, as it has now failed to prove its relevance in front of identity politics
 teesraa, bhakpa duusare sansadeey vampanthi dalon kii tarah hi naye kshetron main apana vistaar karne main naakaam rahi he
 It has become a stalled party in a way
 yaa to yah kuch jagahon par apana aadhaar bachaane main safal rahi he, yaa us aadhaar ko bhi kho rahi he
 The CPI is not spreading in new areas
 1980 ke baad hue loksabhaa ke har chunaav main ise 15 se kam siton par hi jeet mili
 For example, in the 1980 parliamentary elections, 11 seats were won in 1984, 6 in 1989, 14 in 1991, 12 in 1996, 9 in 1998, 4 in 1999, 10 in 2004 and 4 seats in 2009
 chauthaa, yah bhi aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki bhakpa ne jamini str par sangharsh kii raajnneeti se munh mode liya he
 This criticism, however, cannot be taken as completely correct, because in areas where the CPI exists, it has fought a lot against state repression
 masalan, chhattisgarh ke dantewada jile main bhakpa ne rajya pryojit salwa judum abhiyaan kaa tikhaa pratirodh kiya
 Fifth, one of the grounds for criticism of CPI politics has been that it has fully accepted the democratic system of the capitalist state
 ab yah rashtravaadi ruparekha ke bheetar hi kaam kar rahi he or poonjeewaadi rajya ko ukhaad phenkane jaisi ranneeti isaki raajnneeti kaa bhaag nahin he
 However, despite these criticisms, it cannot be denied that the CPI has a long heritage in Indian politics
 bhartiya communist raajnneeti kii adhikansh dharaayen isi party se nikaleen
 It has also made serious efforts to establish solidarity between the left parties in parliamentary politics
 isaki koshish rahi he ki bharat main gair-congressi, gair-bhaajapaayi raajnneeti ko majbooti or aam logon ke hiton ko badhaava mili
 The CPI has been completely free from allegations of corruption at all levels
 asal main, bhakpa kii mukhya chunauti yah he ki yah vam morche kaa bhaag hote hue bhi makapa kii ‘photo copy’ yaa chota sahyogi hone se bache or apni swytt raajnneeti kaayam kare
 Apart from this, spreading itself to different parts of the country is also a big challenge for the CPI

 Aristotle described two types of political revolutions: maanav itihaas main anekon krantiyaan ghatit hoti ai hai or vah paddati, avadhi va prerak vaicharik siddhant ke maamle main kaaphi bhinn hai
 Due to their results, there were major changes in culture, economy and socio-political institutions
 ek kranti main koun se ghatak shaamil hote hai or koun se nahin, is sambandh main vidvattapurna charchaa kai muddon ke ird gird kendrit he
 Early studies of revolutions have primarily analyzed European history from a psychological point of view, but more modern trials also include global phenomena and include the perspectives of many social sciences, including sociology and political science

 The first political use of the term was in 1688 by William III to describe James ii's replacement
 is prakriya ko "da glorious rivolushan " kaa naam diya gaya
 Most often, the term 'revolution' is used to indicate a change in socio-political systems
 raajnneetik siddhant ke antargat krati vah he jo kisi desh main raajnneetik satta ke aakasmik parivartan se aarambh hoti he or phir vahiin ke raamaajik jivan ko nae rup main dhaal detii he
 Simpleism: The revolution takes place in a particular socio-political situation
 jeff gudwin kranti kii do paribhaashaayen dete hai
 There is a broad, according to which the revolution is or ek sankeern he, jisamen Jack Goldstone defines them as saying raajnneetik or saamaajik krantiyon kaa adhyayan anekon saamaajik vigyaan ke antargat kiya gaya he, visheshtah samajashaastra, raajnneetishastra or itihaas ke antargat
 is kshetra ke agrani vidwaanon main kraine brinton, charles brocket, farideh farhi, jon foran, jon mason heart, samuel hantington, jaik goldstone, jeff gudwin, ted roberts gur, fred heliday, chammers johnson, tim mike'danniel, bairington moore, jeffri pej, wilfredo pereto, terrence ranger, ujin rosenstock-huse, theda scock paul, james scot, erik celbin, charles tili, ellen ke trimbringer, carlos vistas, jon volton, timothy vikhem-krole or erik woolf aadi rahe hai yaa abhi bhi hai
 Revolution scholars, such as Jack Goldstone, distinguish scholarly research regarding revolutions as four current generations

 alwood yaa pitirim sorokin kii paddati mukhyatah varnanaatmak thi or krantiyon ke tathy ke liye unke dwaara die gaye spashtikaran aam taur par saamaajik manovigyaan se sambandhit the, jaise ki lee boun kaa croud psychology siddhant
 Second generation theorists wanted to develop detailed theories about the causes and times of the early revolutions, which was rooted in more complex social behavioral theories
 inhen teen pramukh paddatiyon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he: manovaigyanik, samajashaastra sambandhi or raajnneetik
 Ted Robert Gurr, Evo K
 Fairbrand, Rosalind L
 Fairbrand, James A
 Geschwander, David C
 Swartz and Denton E
 Morrison, fall under the first category
 unhone sangyanatmak manovigyaan or kuntha-aakraamakata siddhant kaa anusaran kiya or dekha ki kranti kaa kaaran aam janata kii maansik avasthaa he, jabaki is sandarbh main un logon ke bich mat vibhed tha ki vastav main logon ne kis kaaran se vidroh kiya, ve sabhi is baat par sahamat ho gaye ki kranti kaa praathmik kaaran saamaajik-raajnneetik avasthaa ke prati vyapak str par faili hui kuntha thi
 The second group, Chalmers Johnson, Neil Smelser, Bob Jessoup, Mark Hart, Edward A
 Tiryakian, created by academics such as Mark Hagopian, followed Talcaut Parsons and the structural-procedural theory of sociology; He observed that society as a whole is in equilibrium between various resources, demands and subsystems
 jaisaa ki sabhi manovaigyanik vichaardhaaraon main hota he, usee prakaar asantulan ke kaarnon kii paribhaasha ke sambandh main unka mat alag-alag tha, lekin is baat par vah sahamat the ki gambhir asantulan hi kranti ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Finally the third group, consisting of Charles Tilley, Samuel P
 Huntington, Peter Emman, and Arthur L
 Writers such as Stinkokoumbe, followed the path of political science and relied on polytheistic theory and interest group conflict theory
 ye siddhanth maanate hai ki yah ghatnaayen do pratispardhaatmak hit samooh ke madhya adhikaar sangharsh kaa parinaam hai
 In this type of model, revolutions occur when two or more groups are unable to agree in a simple decision-making process, which is traditional for any political system, and at the same time they have an army appointment to pursue their goals
 Adequate resources are available for duusari peedi ke siddhantavaadiyon ne dekha ki krantiyon kaa vikaas ek dohari prakriya he; pehle, vartmaan avasthaa main kuch parivartan aisa parinaam dete hai jo bhootkaal ke parinaamon se bhinn hai; doosraa, nayi avasthaa kranti ke ghatit hone ke liye ek avasar pradaan karti he
 In such a state, an event which was not sufficient to cause revolution in the past, is now enough for it - although if the authorities are conscious of such dangers, then even in this stage, they can stop the protest
 krantiyon se sambandhit anekon praarambhik adhyayanon ne chaar moulik muddon par kendrit hone kaa prayaas kiya- prasidd evam vivaad rahit udhaaharan joki vastav main krantiyon kii sabhi paribhaashaon ke liye sateek he, jaise ki glorious rivolushan, francisi kranti, 1917 kii roosi kranti or chini kranti 
 However, the famous Harvard historian, Crane Brinton, in his famous book "the Anatomy of Revolution" focused on the English Civil War, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution
 samay ke saath, vidvan anya saikadon ghatnaon kaa vishleshan bhi kranti ke rup main karne lage or unki paribhaashaon va paddatiyon main antar ne nayi paribhaasha va spashtikaran ko janm diya
 Second-generation theories have been criticized for their limited geographical spread, difficulties of empirical verification, as well as the fact that although they explain some particular revolutions, they do not provide any explanation that under these circumstances other societies Why did the rebellions not happen in India? duusari peedi kii alochana ke kaaran siddhanton kii teesri peedi kaa janm hua, jisame theda scockpaul, barington moore, jeffri pej or anya lekhak shaamil the joki pracheen marxvaadi varg sangharsh madhyam ke aadhaar par vistaar kar rahe the, vah apana dhyaan gramin krishi rajya sangharsh, ucchwargeey logon ke saath hone vaale rajya sangharsh or antarrajiya aarthik va sainya pratispardhaa dwaara gharelu raajnneetik parivartan par padane vaale prabhaav kii ore kendrit kar rahe the
 In particular, Skokpaul's States and Social Revolutions became one of the most popular works of the third generation; Skoukpaul, while explaining the revolution, said, "it is a rapid, fundamental transformation of society's states and class structure
" 

joki nimna str ke varg aadhaarit vidrohon ke dwaara samarthit va sweekrut hota he" or unhone krantiyon ko rajya, ucchvarg or nimna varg se sambandhit vibhinn sangharshon ke liye uttaradaayi tehraaya
 From the late 1980s a new body of scholarly works began to question the efficacy of third generation theories
 puraane siddhanton ko bhi nayi krantikari ghatnaon ke dwaara khaasaa aghat laga jo unke dwaara saralata se vyakt nahin kiya ja sakaa
 In 1979, the Irani and the Nrikguan Revolutions, the Manpower Revolution in the Philippines in 1986 and the Autum of Nations in Europe in 1989, witnessed the fact that multi-class coincidences demolished many powerful seeming regimes in popular demonstrations and mass strikes in non-violent revolutions
 
 ab kranti yaa vidroh ko europea hinsak avasthaa banaam janata yaa varg sangharsh ke rup main paribhaashit karnaa paryaapt nahin tha
 Thus the study of revolutions developed in three directions, first, some researchers were applying previous or updated structural theories of the revolution in relation to events that were not previously analyzed, mostly European conflicts
 Secondly, according to scholars, in order to shape the revolutionary mobilization and goals in the form of ideological beliefs and culture, more attention was needed to the conscious institution
 teesraa, krantiyon or saamaajik aandolanon, donon hi kshetra ke vishleshkon ne yah anubhav kiya ki donon tathyon ke bich kaaphi kuch ubhaynishth he or vivadpurn raajnneeti ke ek nae 'chauthi peedi' ke sahitya kaa vikaas hua joki donon tathyon ko samajhane kii aashaa main saamaajik aandolanon or krantiyon donon ke hi parigyanon ko jodne kaa prayaas karata he
 Although the revolutions, including the Communist Revolution which was relatively peaceful and that overthrown the Communist regime, also included Afghanistan's violent revolution, under the Revolution, it also called the Copse d'étatas, civil war, rebellions and such treason
 Does not include those who do not make any attempt to authenticate or transform society into rights or The Civil War), as well as institutional arrangements such as plebiscites and free elections, as the peaceful transition to democracy through, it was after the death of Francisco Franco in Spain also does not incorporated within the revolution
 saamaajik vigyaan or sahitya main krantiyon ke anekon bhinn varg vigyaan hai
 For example, the ancient scholar Alexis de Touqueville described 1) political revolutions and 2) emergent and violent revolutions that seek not only to establish a new political system but to transform the entire society and 3) slow but widespread transformation of the overall society Which takes many generations to fully come into its form
 anekon bhinn marxvaadi varg vigyaanon main se ek krantiyon ko purv-poonjeevaad, praarambhik poonjivadi, poonjivadi, poonjivadi-prajatantrik, praarambhik nirdhan or saamaajik krantiyon main vibhajit karata he
 Charles Tilley, a modern scholar of the revolution, has distinguished between a coup, a right-to-confiscation, a civil war, a rebellion and a "great revolution"
 anya prakaar kii krantiyaan, jinka nirmaan anya varg vigyaan ke liye kiya gaya he, uname saamaajik krantiyaan; shramjivi varg yaa communist krantiyaan shaamil hai jo marxvad ke vichaaron se prabhavit hai or poonjeevaad ko communistwad se sthanantharitt karne kaa lakshya rakhte hai); asafal yaa apurna krantiyaan yaa hinsak banaam ahimsak krantiyaan
 The term "revolution" is also used to indicate the vast changes that have taken place outside the political sphere
 aisi krantiyaan praayah raajnneetik pranali kii apeksha samaaj, samskruti, darshan or praudyogiki main adhik parivartan laane ke liye pahachaani jaati hai, inhen praayah saamaajik kranti ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Some may be global, while others are limited to a single country

 yah gindbu is yuddh main asyrian ke viruddh ladane vaale mitrapaksh main arab gut kaa sardaar tha
 The most popular story of origin of the name 'arab' is that it came from a man named 'yarb' who was the first person to speak Arabic
 pracheen arab buddhijivi al-hamadani kii alag raay thi
 He said that because the Arabs settled in the West from Mesopotamia, the word 'gharb' was used for them, meaning 'west' in Arabic and other local languages
 yahi bigadakar 'arab' ban gaya
 Another ancient Arab historian, al-masoodi, stated that the name was initially meant for the inhabitants of 'arabah Wadi' which expanded and began to be used for the entire race
