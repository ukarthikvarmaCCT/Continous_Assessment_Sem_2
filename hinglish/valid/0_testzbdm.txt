 International relations is the study of relations between different countries, as well as the role of sovereign states, inter-governmental organizations, international ngos, non-governmental organizations and multinationals
 anterrashtriya sambandh ko kabhi-kabhi 'antararashtriya adhyayan' ) ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, haalanki donon shabd puri tarah se paryaay nahin hai
 In simple terms, 'international politics' means 'doing politics among states'
 yadi 'raajnneeti' ke arth kaa adhyayan karen to teen pramukh tatv saamne aate hai - samoohon kaa astitv; samoohon ke bich sahmati; tathaa samoohon dwaara apane hiton kii purti
 If we assess this effect internationally, then these three elements are mainly - the existence of states; Conflict between states; And the use of power to fulfill their national interests
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti un kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karnaa he jiske antargat rajya apane raashtra hiton kii purti hetu shakti ke aadhaar par sangharshrat rahete hai
 In this context, national interests are the main goals of international politics; Conflict sets its direction; And Shakti is considered as the main means of achieving this objective
 parantu uparyukt paribhaasha ko ham paramparaagat maan sakate hai, kyonki aaj ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ kaa sthaan isse vyapak avadharana ‘antarrashtriya sambandhon’ ne le liya he
 Under this, along with mutual conflict of states, the collaborative aspects are now studied under international politics
 iske atirikt aaj ‘rajyon’ ke alaava anya kai kaarak bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vishay kshetra ban gaye hai
 Therefore, under this, individuals, institutions, organizations and many other non-state units have also joined
 iskaa vartmaan aadhaar va vishay kshetra aaj kaaphi vyapak swaroop le chukaa he
 Before discussing all these topics, it becomes very essential to review the following definitions given by different scholars- in paribhaashaon kaa dayera ati simit he, kyonki iske antargat multah ‘rajyon’ ko hi anterrashtriya raajnneeti ke kaarak ke rup main mana gaya he
 It is limited to the nature of international politics
 mukhya rup se hence je
 margenthau, herald spraoot, bone doyak, thampsan aadi iske mukhya samarthak hai jo inaki nimna paribhaashaon se spasht ho jaataa he- International definitions discuss the broad nature of international politics, international relations
 isamen rajya ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke naveen karkon jaise antarrashtriya sanghathan, deshaantar samooh, gaiyr sarkari sanghathan, antarrashtriya santhaayen, kuch vyaktiyon aadi ko bhi sammilit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, along with the struggle, cooperation and politics, as well as directly or indirectly affecting it, ie, cultural, religious, social, science and technical aspects are also mentioned
 vibhinn lekhakon kii nimnlikhit paribhaashaon se yah aashay ati spasht rup main ujagar ho jaataa he- In this way the nature of international politics becomes very broad from the beginning to the present
 isamen aaj raashtra rajyon ke saath vibhinn vishwa ikaayiyon evam sanghathanon ke adhyayan kaa samavesh ho chukaa he
 But even after all these changes, the focal point of these studies is still a nation state
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ke bare main nimna nishkarsh saamne aate hai
 Therefore, the nature of international politics is variable
 jab-jab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke parivesh, karkon va ghatnakram main parivartan aayegaa, iske adhyayan karne ke tareekon va drushtikonon main bhi parivartan anivaary he
 Additionally, this change is continuous rather than permanent
 iske saath-saath vibhinn karkon, staron, ayaamon aadi ke kaaran yah bahut jatil he atah iske sucharu adhyayan hetu bahut spasht, tarksangat, vyapak drushtikon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As is known from the above definitions and form, the subject area of international politics is increasing
 aaj iskaa vishay kshetra kaaphi vyapak ho gaya he jiske antargat nimnlikhit baton kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he- Therefore, today the subject area of international politics is very broad and complex and is moving towards development
 iske antargat vibhinn paramparaagat karkon ke saath-saath gaiyr-paramparaagat karkon kaa adhyayan bhi mahatvapurn hota ja rahaa he
 The history of the development of international politics is not very ancient, rather the subject is a product of the twentieth century
 spasht rup se dekha jaae to velj vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya woodro wilson peeth kii 1919 main sthapana se hi iskaa itihaas prarambh hota he

 isi samay anya vishvavidhyalayon evam sansthaanon main bhi isi prakaar kii vyavasthaaen dekhne ko mili
 Therefore, if we look at the history of this subject in the last one century, then along with the ups and downs in this subject, information about its establishment in an autonomous subject is available
 is vishay main aaye bahuaiami parivartanon ne jahaan ek ore vishaywastu kaa sanvardhan, samanvay tathaa vikaas kiya he, vahiin duusari ore vibhinn siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karke bahut si jatil samasyaon evam pahaluon ko samajhane main sahaayta pradaan kii he
 Kenneth Thompson in his 1962 review, Review of Politics, has divided the history of international politics into four parts, on the basis of which a clear and sure study of this subject can be possible
 vikaas ke in chaar charnon main shityudhottar yug ke paanchaven charan ko bhi sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 Their detailed description is as follows: pratham vishwayuddh se purv itihaas, kanoon, raajnneeti shaastra, darshan shaastra aadi ke vidwaan hi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke alag-alag pahaluon par vichaar karte the
 It was mainly historians who studied it as diplomatic history and the history of relations with other countries
 iske antargat kootneetigyon va videsh mantriyon dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon kaa lekha jokha hota tha
 Hence, it is also known as diplomatic history
 i
ech
car ke anusaar pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh kaa sambandh keval sainikon tak samajha jaataa tha tathaa iske samakaksh antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa sambandh rajanyikon tak
 In addition, even in democratic countries, foreign policy was traditionally kept separate from party politics and the elected members also felt unable to control the foreign ministry
 1919 se purv is vishay ke prati udaseenta ke kai pramukh kaaran the - pratham, is samay tak yahi samajha jaataa tha ki yuddh va rajyon main gathbandhan usee prakaar swaabhaavik he jaise garibi va berogari
 Therefore, preventing war, foreign policy and mutual relations between states was considered out of the control of human power
 dwitiya, pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh itane bhayankar nahin hote the
 Third, in the absence of means of communication, international politics was limited to a few states
 is prakaar is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan kii sabase badi kami saamaanya hiton kaa vikaas rahaa
 In this period, only a descriptive study of diplomatic history was done
 parinamswaroop, isse na to vartmaan tathaa na hi bhavi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane main koi madad mili
 The quantum achievement of this era was the establishment of the Chair of the Study of International Politics at the University of Wales in 1919
 do vishwa yudhon ke bich ke kaal main do samaanaantar dhaaraon kaa vikaas hua
 The first of which emphasized the study of current events / problems, except for the dominance of earlier historicity
 iske saath saath ab aitihaasik raajnneetik adhyayan ko vartmaan raajnneetik sandarbhon ke saath jod kar dekhne kaa prayaas bhi kiya gaya
 Despite the diminishing of historical influence, there still remains a lack of a holistic approach to the study of international politics
 is kaal main vartmaan ke adhyayan par to bahut bal diya gaya, lekin vartmaan evam ateet ke parsparik sambandh ke mahatv ko abhi bhi pahachaanaa nahin gaya
 In addition, neither was there an attempt to see post-war political problems with comparable problems of the past
 shaayad isiilie is yug main bhi do moolbhoot kamiyaan spasht rup se ujagar raheen
 First, like the first phase, universal principles could not develop in international politics even in this period
 dwitiya, aaj bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa adhyayan adhik suspasht evam tarksangat nahin ban paaya
 Thus, in this phase, there was not much change in the study of international politics except the change in the status of force, nor was the confirmation of this subject becoming an explicitly independent discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa tritiy charan bhi dwitiya charan ke samaanaantar do vishwa yudhon ke bich kaa kaal rahaa
 It is called the era of reformism because it envisaged reform of international politics through the establishment of the League of Nations by the states
 is yug main mukhya rup se sansthagat vikaas kiya gaya
 The scholars, diplomats, politicians and thinkers of this period believed that if international institutions are developed, then the problems of war and peace present in front of the world community will be possible
 is uddeshy hetu kuch kanoonee va naitik upagamon kii sanrachanaayen kii gai jinke nimna mukhya aadhaar the
 International organization was envisaged with emphasis on these ideals and moral values
 isaki sthapana ke uparant yah mana gaya ki ab antarrashtriya sambandhon main rajyon ke madhya shaanti banane kaa sangharsh samaapt ho gaya
 There will be no place of balance of power under the new system
 ab rajya apane vivaadon kaa nipataara sangh ke madhyam se karenge
 Therefore, in this era not only the problems of war and peace were discussed, but its far-reaching reforms were also thought of
 atah adhyayankartaaon ke mukhya bindu bhi kanoonee samasyaon va sanghathanon ke vikaas ke saath-saath inke madhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ko badalane vaala rahaa
 Finally, in this period more emphasis has been laid on emotional, imaginative and moral reformism
 parantu vishwayudhon ke bich in upagamon kii sarthakata par hameshaa prashn chihn laga rahaa
 While the first decade of United Nations activities showed a ray of hope, the economic situation of the second decade completely ended this notion
 badi shaktiyon ke madhya asahyog va gutbandiyon ne shaanti kii sthapana kii bajaay shakti sangharsh vyavastha ko janm diya
 While Japan invaded Manchuria and disrupted peace, Italy, Germany and Russia not only relinquished membership of the League in controversial situations, but also intensified the process of the start of World War II
 is prakaar shaanti, naitikta, va kanoon se vishwa vyavastha nahin chal saki, to i

car, shumbha, quinci rhit aadi lekhakon ke kaaran yathartwaadee drushtikon ko vaikalpik upaagam ke rup main bal mila
 The fundamental changes in international politics at this stage not only broadened its content but also led to many complications
 shitayugin kaal main raajnneeti ke swaroop main parivartan tathaa naye rajyon ke udai ne sampoorn antarrashtriya parivesh ko hi badal diya
 As a result, new approaches, dimensions, institutions and trends were created through which the study of international relations was ensured
 purv charnon kii aadarshik, sansthagat, naitik, kanoonee evam sudhaarwadi dhaaraon kii asafalataaon ne naye upagamon ke vikaas kii ore agrasar kiya
 This new approach was realism
 vaise to i

car, shwarjanbarger, quinci rhit, shubhaan aadi lekhakon ne is drushtikon ko viksit kiya, parantu hence je
 margenthau ne ise ek saamaanya siddhanth ke rup main prastut kiya
 According to this theory, states are always struggling to fulfill their interests
 atah anterrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane hetu is shakti sangharsh ke vibhinn ayaamon ko samajhnaa ati aavashyak he
 International organization also originated in the form of assured and unambiguous development of international institutions with realistic outlook
 ab is sanghathan kaa swaroop maatra adarshavaadi va sudhaarwadi na hokar, mahatvapurn raajnneetik sanghathan ke rup main ubhar kar aayaa
 Under this, apart from saving mankind from the ravages of war, what are the reasons for the conflict between the states? What are the risk factors for world peace? How can peace be established? How can arms race be stopped? Efforts were also made to find solutions to many types of questions
 uparokt do pravritiyon ke saath-saath vyavahaarwad kii utpatti bhi is yug kii mahatvapurn uplabdhi rahi
 An attempt was made to understand international politics by creating "system theory" through a pragmatic approach
 is upaagam ke antargat rajyon ke adhyayan hetu teen pramukh karkon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa zaruri mana gaya
 These factors were- uparokt pravritiyon kaa mukhya bal antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saiddhantikaran ko badhaava dena rahaa he
 Therefore, it has been a very important task in this era to propose the universal principles of international politics
 siddhanth nirmaan kii is prakriya ke parinaam swaroop anek aanshik siddhanton jaise - yatharthwaad, santulan kaa siddhanth, sanchaar siddhanth, krida siddhanth, saudebaaji kaa siddhanth, shaanti anusandhan drushtikon, vyavastha siddhanth, vishwa vyavastha pratimaan aadi kaa nirmaan hua
 Despite the rendering of these principles, there still remains a lack of any universal and common principle in this era
 1990 ke dashak main jaint bandhopadhyaay ne apni pustak - general theory of international rilations - main martin kaplan ke vyavasthaaparak siddhanth kii kamiyon ko dur kar ek saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana kii koshish kii he, parantu vah bhi abhi vaad-pratwaad ke daur main hi hai
 Therefore, despite the main phase of theorization, the era of the Cold War remained deprived of any one general principle due to its ideological narrowness and isolation
 shityudhottar yug main sabhi rashtron dwaara ek aarthik vyavastha ke antargat judana prarambh kar diya
 That is why the era of globalization, liberalization, free market system etc
 has started
 is sandarbh main na keval aarthik muddon kaa hi mahatv badha, apitu antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa mahatv or bhi bad gaya
 Today, the distinction of nationalism and internationalism has ended
 Apart from this, now the table of international politics has included a lot of new topics which, instead of being national, now emerge as problems of mankind
 vartmaan vishwa kii pramukh samasyaon main aatankwaad, paryaavaran, ozon parat ksheen hona, nashile padaarthon evam maadak dravyon kii taskari, maanavadhikaron kaa hanan aadi pramukh mudde ubhar kar saamne aaye jinka rashtriya str yaa kshetray str kii bajaay antarrashtriya str par hal nikaalnaa anivaary ban gaya he
 Even at the theoretical level, the attempt to establish the universal principle from 1945 to 1991 got a shock
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii is sandarbh main ab praathamiktaayen badal gai
 In post-modernism, the significance of universal principles are now being questioned
 aitihaasik sandarbh evam pracheen parivesh ke prabhaav ko bhi nakaara ja rahaa he
 Now the independent issues have become more important
 vrihat siddhanth gaun ho gaye hai
 Partial research has become more important in the new context
 udhaahranswaroop nariwad, maanavadhikaar, paryaavaran aadi vishyon par adhik bal dene ke saath-saath chintan bhi prarambh ho gaya he
 Therefore, in the post-cold War era, the nature, content and subject area of international politics have completely changed
 ab saamaanya saiddhanthik sthapana par bhi adhik bal nahin diya ja rahaa he
 That is why, in this changed environment, international politics seems to be not only important but also towards autonomy
 or vishay kii swaittata hetu ashaavadi sanket dikhaai dete hai
 The Second World War not only influenced international politics fundamentally, but also expressed many important issues
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke karkon main parivartan, karkon ko vyapak swaroop pradaan karnaa, naveen siddhanton kaa pratipaadan aadi anek vishyon ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa purna parivesh hi badal kar rakh diya he
 While there is a debate on the theoretical level of realism and idealism on the one hand, and on the ancient and scientific debate, on the other hand controversial questions were being raised about the format of international relations topic - whether international relations is a Autonomous subject or not? Although it is being taught as an autonomous subject at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and research in most universities today, it is not recognized as equivalent to other subjects of social science
 itnaa avashya hua he ki viksit deshon main to kai vishvavidhyalayon main ise purna rup se swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Developing countries like India have also improved
 yahaan prarambh main ‘bhartiya antarrashtriya sambandh skool, nai dilli’ jo baad main jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya sambandh skool ke rup main swytt rup se kaary kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, many other universities like Jadavpur University, Calcutta, Goa University etc
 have also got the status of autonomous subjects
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ko ek swytt vishay ke rup main adhyayan karne se purv ek baat spasht kerani ati aavashyak he ki jab ham is vishay kii swaittata ke prashn kaa adhyayan karte hai to ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ va antarrashtriya sambandhon ko alag-alag vishay nahin maanate hai
 This has been done because both disciplines are still recognized as a sub-discipline of the subject of political science rather than as an autonomous discipline
 duusare inkaa vibhed itnaa sookshm he ki anushaasan kii swaittata kii pramanikta ke baad is vishay ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In the context of considering international politics as an autonomous subject, three different views have been given which are as follows - jo vidwaan is vishay ko swytt maanate hai unke anusaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay vastu va anushaasan sambandhi saamagree ko dekhte hue ise ek swytt vishay mana janaa chahie
 The main proponents of this argument are - CAW
 Manning, Quincy Right, Robert Lotting Allen, Hannes J
 Margenthau, Carl M
 Copper Johnson, Hoffmann; AL Burn etc
 in vidwaanon ne nimna aadhaaron par ise swytt vishay pramanit kiya he- Those scholars who do not consider international politics as an autonomous subject, believe that there is no such unique thing in this subject that it should be considered autonomous for study
 unhone nimna tarko ke aadhaar par apni baat kaa samarthan kiya he- Some scholars consider both of the above debates as meaningless
 unka maananaa yah he ki uparyukt donon tarkon ko antarrashtriya raajnneeti main hue vikaas ke madhyam se adhik bhalee prakaar se janaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, a review of the development of the 20th century, and especially after 1945, is extremely essential
 yadi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii swaittata ke prashn kaa gahan adhyayan karte hai to pataa chalata he ki is sandarbh main do moolbhoot samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 One, there have been effective changes in the nature, content and methods of international relations
 doosraa, isi samay raajnneetishastra kii paridhi kii jatiltaaon evam aparibhaashit simaaon ke vikaas ke kaaran samasya or bad gai he
 But if we look at the development of international politics from 1919 till date, it is clear that its achievements will prove very helpful in giving it autonomy
 1919 ke baad se hi, visheshkar america main, bahut se vidwaanon ne is vishay ko adhik se adhik vaigyanik banane hetu prayaas kiye hai
 Efforts have also been made to explain its content, methods and principles

 After a review in this context, Richard Smythbeel has come to the conclusion that- dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad is sthiti main mahatvapurn parivartan aae hai
 On the one hand, on the one hand, based on new researches in this field, the international relations analytic relations have been strengthened, on the other hand new theories have also been formulated
 america main anek viddhanon mukhya rup se margenthau, richard snidar, martin kaplan, karl dablyoo dois, charles mekalaland aadi ne is ore vishisht yogadan diya he
 In addition, emphasis has been laid on the study of both developed and developing countries
 isaki vishay saamagree kaa sankalan, siddhanth pratipaadan evam paddatiyon kaa bhi kaaphi vikaas hua he
 But even today, the most important deficiency remains the lack of a universal / general principle
 shityudhottar vishwa main iskaa mahatv or bad gaya he
 In this era of globalization, all the states are getting connected with one type of economic system
 antarrashtriya va rashtriya mudde jaise paryaavaran, aatankwaad, nariwad, adj, ozon parat ksheen hona, maanavadhikaar aadi rashtriya kii bajaay maanviya / maanavjaati se sambhddha ho gaye hai
 Therefore, active participation of international forums / organizations is necessary to solve all these
 ab saarvbhaumik siddhanth ko bhi uttar aadhunikwaad kii drushti se nakaar kar vyaktiparak evam sthaneey aadhaar par adhik bal diya gaya he
 Therefore, on the basis of the development after 1945, it can be said to be leading to autonomy, which after 1991 the process of the end of the Cold War has tried to strengthen

 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 252 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate hai
 a quantity will be studied as an exponential decay if the amount is decreasing proportional to its current value, ie the rate of decreasing its value is proportional to its current value
 ganitiya rup main uparokt kathan ko nimna avakal sameekaran dwaara vyakt kiya ja saktaa he, jahaan n maatra he or λ ek dhanatmak sankhya he jise kshay niyatank kehete hai: The solution to the above equation is: Rate of exponential change yahan n samay t par maatra he or N0 = n iskaa t=0 par arthath praarambhik maan he
 If the amount of decayed element n in a body at time t is the number of elements separated in a certain set, then it is possible to calculate the mean value of the time in which the element resides in the set
 is samay ko madhya aayu kaha jaataa he, ise τ se nirupit kiya jaataa he or yah pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he ki yah kshay dar λ, se nimna prakaar sambandh hoti he: The mean age is also seen as "unit time", because we can also write the exponential decay rate equation by the mean age, τ, instead of the decay constant λ: yahan ham dekh sakate hai ki τ vah samay he jab raashi kii kul maatra 1 / e = 0
367879441 tak kam ho jaati he
 For example, if the initial value is n = 1000 then at time τ, its value will be n = 368
 ek isi tarah kii raashi tab praapt hoti he jab aadhaar e ke sthaan par 2 liya jaataa he
 In that case it is called "half-age"
 ardhayu kaal, kshay hote hue kisi tatva kaa wo kaal hota he; jisamen wo tatva mul maatra se aadha ho jaye
 It is called the half-age of that element and is denoted by the symbol t1 / 2
 ardh-aayu ko madhya aayu athwa kshay niyatank ke vyanjakon ke rup main likhaa ja saktaa he: Writing the equation based on 2: atah padaarth kii 2−1 = 1 / 2 maatra shesh rahati he
 Hence the mean age τ { \ displaystyle \ tau} is obtained by dividing the half-age by a natural logarithm of 2, ie: udhaaharan ke liye polonium-210 kii ardh-aayu 138 din he or isaki madhya aayu 200 din he
 The equation that represents the exponential decay is written as follows yaa, punarvinyasit karne par, On inclusion jahaan c samakalan niyatank he atah Where the last substitution, N0 = ec, is obtained by t = 0 in the equation, N0 is the amount of substance at t = 0

 netwarking, sanchaar or gatyaatmakataa main ai teji se kisi vyakti kii pahchaan kii jaanch padtaal karne ke vishwasaneey tareekon kii aavashyaktaa bad gai he
 The first people have been identified by their images, signatures, thumb and fingerprints of the hand, but they have been manipulated
 ise dekhte hue vaigyanikon ne jaivik vidhi se is samasya kaa samaadhaan karne kaa tarika khoja he
 The result is biometrics
 venezuela main aam chunaavon ke dauraan dohare matdaan ko rokane ke liye biometric card kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The reliability of a biometrics system is highly regarded
 iske kai kaaran hai, jaise prayek vyakti main pai jane vaali biometrix vishisht hoti he
 Biometric discoveries can neither be forgotten nor altered
 yadi kisi durghatanavash ang vikrut ho jaae, tabhi isamen badlaav sambhav he, anyathaa yah chihn vyakti main sthai prakruti ke hote hai
 The biometric data collected is first encrypted to maintain the identity, so that it cannot be cloned
 iske alaava is takanic ko password evam card ke saath milakar prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus the reliability of the biometric system is highly stated
 maanav gundharmon ko biometrics main nimna paramitaron ke pad main prayog kiya ja saktaa he, ye samajhnaa sambhav he
 a biometric system can operate in the following two forms: isamen vyakti ke haath ke anguuthe ke nishaan, anguliyon, ankhon kii putliyon, aawaaj evam gunasutra yani diene ke aadhaar par use pahachaanaa jaataa he, kyonki aisa mana jaataa he ki prayek vyakti kii ye chijen adwitiya hoti he
 This technology is in good use in Australia, Brazil, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Nigeria, Israel
 japan main bank atm mashine haathon kii nason ke dabaav par khulti he, brazil main pahchaan patr main is takanic kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Tourists visiting Australia are first required to submit their biometric evidence

 It is measured on the basis of a person's signature, his voice, etc
 kuch shodhakartaaon ne bieometrics ke is varg ke liye shabd bihaviometrics shabd gadha he
 Currently two methods are used to investigate a person: ye vyakti ke paas uplabdh suraksha card, credit card par aadhaarit hota he
 These can be easily altered and incidents of credit card forgery are often narrated
 fishing evam hekking main praudyogiki ke badhate prayog se koi password ab utana surakshit nahin rah gaya, jitna pehle hua karata tha
 Also, there is a problem of forgetting the password if not used for a long time

 In biometrics, the body and its organs form the basis of protection
 iske alaava sugandh, retina, haathon kii nason ke aadhaar par bhi ise janaa ja saktaa he
 Almost all biometric systems mainly consist of three phases

 The year 2411 BCE or the year before his birth is displayed as the basis of Jesus' birth
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 2411 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 raasalila yaa krishnalila main yuva or balak krishna kii gatividhiyon kaa manchan hota he
 The gopis, ie Brijbalaas, were lanky on the graceful ways of Krishna

 The mischief of Kanha's friends started as soon as the gopis got drunk
 maakhan churaana, matki phodna, gopiyon ke vastra churaana, jaanwaron ko charne ke liye gaanv se dur-dur chhod kar aana hi pramukh sharaaraten thi, jin par puraa vrindavan mohit tha
 On the occasion of Janmashtami, all these Kanchelias of Kanha are threaded into one thread i
e
 giving them theatrical form Rasleela or Krishna Leela is played
 isiilie janmashtami kii taiyaariyon main shrikrishna kii raasalila kaa anand mathura, vrundavan tak simit na rah kar puure desh main chaa jaataa he

 The file is durable in that it exists for use by other programs even after the current program has finished
 sanganak sanchikaon ko paaramparik rup se daphtaron or pustakaalayon ke filon main maujuud kagaz ke dastavezon kaa aadhunik rup mana ja saktaa he, isiilie angrezi main iskaa naam fil padaa he
 At the lowest level, many modern operating systems consider files to be only a series of one-dimensional bytes
 adhik ucch str par, jab sanchika kii saamagree ko bhi maddenzar rakhaa ja rahaa ho, to ye dwilvie ank purna, akshar, chhavi pixel, dhwani yaa kisi or chiz kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue maane ja sakate hai
 It is up to the program to use the file how it interprets the file and understand the internal settings of the information so that it can present the same information in a more meaningful style to the user
 kisi bhi samay par sanchika kaa ek aakaar hoga, aamtaur par yah biton main abhivyakt kiya jaataa he or yah darshata he ki is sanchika ne bhandar main kitni jagah gheri hui he
 In most modern operating systems this size can be any nonnegative integer, but will have a maximum limit according to the system
 lekin sanchika kii saadhaaran paribhaasha yah lazimi nahin tehraati he ki uske maujuuda aakaar kaa koi vaastavik arth ho, sivaay us maamle main jab sanchika kii saamagree, ek drudh sangrah ke samooh ke andar kii kuch saamagree ho
 For example, in a Unix-like system, the file to which the link to / bin / ls points is defined and rarely changed
 isaki tulana / dev / null se karen to yah bhi ek sanchika he par iskaa aakaar hameshaa badalata rahata he balki shaayad us tarah myne hi nahin rakhata he jaise pichley udhaaharan kaa myne rakhata he
 The information and small information contained in a computer file can be in the form of bundles or can also be movable
 yah maatr sanchika ke rachanaakaar par nirbhar he ki usamen jaankaree kaa aayojan kis prakaar kiya jayega
 For this reason, many low-standard file structures exist that can serve any purpose, from the simplest to the most complex
 adhiktar sanganak sanchikaon kaa istemaal sanganak kaarykram karte hai
 These programs create, change and delete the appropriate files for their use
 jo kaarykram-nirmaataa in kaaryakramon ko banaate hai, vahi faisalaa karte hai ki koun si filon kii zarurat he, unka istemaal kaise hona he or unke naam bhi ve nirdhaarit karte hai
 In some cases, computers manipulate program files in such a way that they are visible to the computer user
 udhaaharan ke liye shabd-sansaadhan carkram main prayokta dastauez sanchikaon main badlaav karte hai or prayokta khud hi unhen naam bhi dete hai
 The contents of the document file are organized in such a way that the word-processing program understands it, but the user determines its name and storage address, and the key information of storage is also determined by the user
 kai anuprayog sabhi saamagree sanchikaon ko ek hi sanchika main ghused dete hai or alag alag prakaar kii jaankaree kaa hisaab rakhane ke liye andar hi nishaan laga ke rakhte hai
 Content files from games like Doom and Quake are an example of this
 sanganak par, sanchikaon ko bananaa, badalanaa, badhanaa, chota karnaa, sthanantarit karnaa or mitaanaa sambhav he
 In most cases, all this is done by running computer programs on the computer, but the user of the computer can also make changes to files if needed
 udhaaharan ke liye, microsoft verde kii sanchikaaye aamtaur par prayokta ke nirdeshon ke aadhaar par microsaft verde kaarykram dwaara banaai jaati hai, lekin prayokta in sanchikaon ko sidhe hi windos explorer jaise kisi sanchika prabandhak kaarykram ke jariye bhi hataa, mitaa yaa sthanantirit kar saktaa he
 In unix-like systems, user-zone processes usually do not directly connect to files; The operating system provides a segregation level that allows almost all transactions with files from the user-area to occur through hard links
 kathor kadiyon ke jariye kisi sanchika kaa naam diya ja saktaa he ; vishuddh rup se prachaalan pranali main sanchikaon ke naam nahin hote hai
 For example, user-area programs cannot delete a file, they can only delete a link to that file, and if the linker finds that the file no longer has any other links, it can delete this file
 Can be erased
 vastav main keval ashthi hi sanchikaon se len-dein karata he, par prayokta-kshetra ke anurodhon kaa sanchikaon ke jariye is tarah hota he ki prayokta-kshetra kaaryakramon ko yah agyaat hi rahata he
 While the transaction of programs with files varies according to the operating system and file system, mainly these activities are common: aadhunik sanganak pranaaliyon main sanchikaon tak pahunchne ke liye aamtaur par filanaamon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In some operating systems, this name is associated with the file
 kuch anya main sanchika swayan benaam hoti he, par namit kadiyaan uski ore ingit karti hai
 In this case, the user can only recognize the link as the file name, but this will not be true, especially when the same file has more than one link
 sanchikaaye nirdeshikaon main ho sakati hai
 But it would be better to say that the directory can contain a list of files or a list of links to files
 is paribhaasha ke antargat yah samajhnaa bahut zaruri he ki "sanchika" shabd main nirdeshikas bhi shaamil hai
 This makes staging of directories possible, ie subdirectories inside directories
 jo naam kisi nirdeshika ke andar kisi sanchika ko sanderbhit karata he, use anokhaa hona zaruri he
 But some operating systems also specify a type with a name, which makes it possible to have two different types of files in a directory with the same name, such as a directory and a file of the same name
 jin paryaavarnon main sanchikaaye namit hoti hai, unamem, sanchika ke naam va path kii jodi anokhi honi zaruri he - koi bhi do sanchikaon kaa naam va path dono kisi or sanchika ke naam va path se mail nahin kha sakate hai
 Where the file is anonymous, named references will reside under a namespace
 adhiktar baar kisi bhi namasthaan main maujuud naam thik ek yaa shunya sanchikaon ko sanderbhit karegaa
 However, any file can be referenced in a namespace with zero, one or more names
 anuprayog ke prasang ke anusaar, kisi bhi sanchika yaa kadi ke liye upyukt naam kinhin khaas aksharon se bani hogi
 The computer system depends on whether the name is appropriate or not
 praarambhik sanganak kisi sanchika ke naam main simit akshar va ankon kii anumati dete the, lekin aadhunik sanganak lambey naam rakhane dete hai jinamein lagbhag kisi bhi kram main unicode akshar yaa unicode ank ho sakate hai, taaki ek hi nazar main sanchika kaa makasad samaj aa jaae
 Some computer systems allow empty spaces in file names, some do not
 sanchika naamon kii laghuderghakshar samvedansheeltaa sanchika pranali dwaara nirdhaarit hoti he
 Unix file systems are typically short-term and allow user-level applications to create files that contain only short and long letters
 microsoft windos kai sanchika pranaliyaan pradaan karata he, jinamein lugh-deergh samvedansheeltaa kii nitiyaan alag alag hai
 If the user uses a disk editor to change file names in directory entries, then the prevalent FAT system may contain many files whose names differ only by capitalization
 lekin, aamtaur par prayokta anuprayog isaki anumati nahin dete hai
 Most computers organize files based on steps and use folders, directories or catalogs for this
 shabd jo bhi ho vichaar ek hi he
 Each folder may contain some number of files and may contain other folders
 in anya folderon ko upfolder kehete hai
 These may contain more files and folders, etc
, etc
, by creating a tree-like structure containing a "master folder" or under which any number of files and folders can be
 folderon ke bhi sanchikaon kii tarah naam ho sakate hai 
 It is easy to organize files logically through folders
 jab bhi koi sanganak folderon kaa istemaal karata he to harek sanchika va folder kaa keval apana naam hi nahin apitu ek path bhi hota he jo yah darshata he ki vah sanchika yaa folder kis folder yaa folderon main maujuud he
 In this path, a special mark - such as / - is written between the file or folder names
 udhaaharan ke liye is lekh main die udhaaharan main, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers yah darshata he ki Managers naamak ek sanchika, Salaries naamak folder main he, r yah folder Payroll main he
 There is a forward line between the file and folder names, the topmost or root folder has no name, so the name starts with a forward line
 kai sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon me vistaaron kaa istemaal karte hai, inhen sanchika prakaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Windows computers, the extension takes the form of a dot after the name of the file and a few characters before the point, these characters are the type of file identified
 
txt vistaar paathya sanchika kaa pahchaan he, 
doc vistaar kisi dastauez kaa pahchaan he, khaastaur par microsoft verde sanchika praaroop main; aadi ityadi
 Even when extensions are used on the computer system, there is considerable diversity in the extent to which the computer system recognizes and behaves according to them, in some systems they are indispensable, while in others they are also present
 It does not matter, they are ignored
 kai aadhunik sanganak pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko nuksaan pahunchne se rokane ke tareeke pradaan karti he
 Computers that allow more than one user also enforce file permissions to control which files and folders can be created, deleted, or changed
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi prayokta ko ek sanchika ko badalane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin, yaa phir sanchikaaye va folder banane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin
 It can also be determined through permissions that only a few users can see the contents of a file or folder
 anumatiyon ke jariye sanchikaon main maujuud saamagree ke avaidh badlaav yaa vinaash se bachaav hota he or nijee jaankaree ko gopneey rakhane ke liye avaidh prayoktaaon ko kuch sanchikaaye dekhne se roka ja saktaa he
 Many computers have another rescue method known as "read only mark"
 yah chihn lage hone par sanchiko kaa nirikshan kiya ja saktaa he par badla nahin ja saktaa he
 This sign is useful for critical information that should not be changed or erased, such as for certain files used by internal components of a computer system
 kuch pranaliyaan ek "chhipi hui chihn" bhi shaamil karti hai, jo yah sunishchit karata he ki sanchika adrishy ho jaae
 With this symbol, the computer system hides important system files that should not be changed by users
 uparokt charchaa main sanchika kaa varnan ek ucch stareey prachaalan pranali yaa prayokta ke liye ek pariklpana ke taur par hua he
 However, any file must be physically present to be truly workable
 arthath, ek sanchika kii amoort avadharana ko vaastavik sanganak pranali main vaastavik bhautik rup main hona aavashyak he, anyathaa uskaa aastitiv hona na hona baraabar he
 Physically, most computer files are stored in some kind of content storage device
 udhaaharan he hard jisk, jiske jariye adhiktar prachaalan pranaliyaan chalati hai
 Most of the files are kept in these
 21veen sadi ke praarabdh main hard discs sarvaadhik uplabdh gaiyr vaashpashil bhandaaran upkaran he
 If the files contain only temporary contents, they can be stored in RAM
 unics jaisi prachaalan pranaaliyon main kai sanchikaon kaa kisi bhautik bhandaaran upkaran se sidhaa vaasta nahin hota he: / dev / null iskaa ek pramukh udhaaharan he, isi tarah / dev, / proc or / sys ke antarangat maujuud lagbhag sabhi sanchikaaye bhi isi prakaar kii hai
 They can be used as files in the user area
 lekin ye abhaasi sanchikaaye hai jo vastav main keval prachaalan pranali kii ashthi kii vastuon ke taur par vidyaman rahati hai
 Computer files can be stored in magnetic strips
 kuch sthitiyon main sanchikaon ko anya madhyamon main bhi bhandaarit kiya ja saktaa he jaise ki lekhneey kampact discs, ankiy bahuvid discs, zip drive, yuasabi flash drive aadi
 When the computer files contain very important information, the copying process tries to avoid the consequences in situations where the files can be lost
 sanchikaon kii pratilipi karne kaa matlab bas yahi he ki sanchikaon kii pratiyaan kisi anya sthaan par baan ke rakhana taaki yadi mul sanganak ko kuch ho jaataa he yaa ve galati se mit jaati hai to prati ke jariye unhen waapas paaya ja sake
 There are several ways to copy files
 adhiktar sanganak pranaliyaan suvidhaatmak kaarykram pradaan karte hai jo ki prati rakhane kii prakriya main suvidha pradaan karte hai, kyonki yadi bahut si sanchikaon kii pratiyaan rakhni hai to isamen bahut samay lag saktaa he
 Files are often copied to transferable mediums such as writable cds or cartridge tapes
 ek hi sanganak kii duusari hard discs main sanchikaon ko pratilipit karne se ek discs ke kharaab hone se to bachaav ho jaataa he par yadi puure sanganak ke kharaab yaa nasht hone ke jokhim se bachaav karnaa he to un sanchikaon kii pratiyaan aise madhyam main karnaa zaruri he jo is sanganak se dur le ja ke kisi surakshit jagah par bhandaarit kii ja sake
 The grand-father-son copy method automatically creates three copies, the oldest copy of the file being the grandfather file and the son existing copy
 kis sanganak dwaara sanchikaon ko yojit, namit, bhandaarit va parivartit karne kii pranali ko uski sanchika pranali kaha jaataa he
 Most operating systems have at least one file system
 kai prachaalan pranaaliyon main kai sanchika pranaliyaan ek saath chalaai ja sakati he
 For example, newer MS Windows computers support older fat-style file systems of MS-DOS, as well as NTFS, the popular file system of the latest Windows versions
 har pranali ke apane faayde nuksaan hai
 For example, in standard FAT, only 8-letter file names run, whereas NTFS contains possible long file names that may contain spaces
 aap kisi sanchika ko antiatioes main Payroll records jaisaa naam de sakate hai lekin effeti main yah naam kuch payroll
dat jaisaa hi ho saktaa he 
 File manager programs are convenient programs through which files and folders can be moved, created, deleted, or renamed, but they do not actually allow you to read or add content to the file
 har sanganak pranali apni mul sanchika pranali ke liye kam se kam ek sanchika prabandhak pradaan karata he
 The most commonly used file manager program in Windows is Windows Explorer and on Mac it is Finder
 linaks main notilas, conkvarar jaise kai sanchika prabandhak hai
 The use of the English word "file" for file storage in reference to computer storage was started since 1952 for information stored in camouflage leaves
 praarambhik prayog main log antarnihit tantransh ko hi fil kehete the
 For example, IBM 350's disk drives were called "disk files"
 1962 ke sangat samay saajha pranali jaisi pranaaliyon main aisi sanchika pranaliyaan thim jo ek hi sanchay upkaran par kai "sanchikaaye" pradarshit karti thim or is tarah is shabd kaa aadhunik upyog shuru hua
 CTSS file names had two parts, a user-readable "principal name" and the other "secondary name" that indicated the type of file
 yah aachaar kai prachaalan pranaaliyon dwaara aaj bhi kaam main liya jaataa he, inamen microsoft windos bhi shaamil he
 While the "register file" used today shows the initial hypothesis of files, it is often lost

 Although the definition and field of ethics have been subject to differences in each age, it can be widely said that ethics discusses general principles on the basis of which human actions and objectives can be evaluated
 adhiktar lekhak or vichaarak is baat se bhi sahamat hai ki achaarshastra kaa sambandh mukhyat: manandadon or mulyon se he, na ki vastusthitiyon ke adhyayan yaa khoj se or in mandandon kaa prayog na keval vyaktigat jivan ke vishleshan main kiya janaa chahie varan saamaajik jivan ke vishleshan main bhi
 By defining concepts such as good and bad, right and wrong, virtue and blame, justice and crime, ethics attempts to address questions of human morality
 bauddhik samiksha ke kshetra ke rup main, vah naitik darshan, varnatmak nitishastra, or mulya siddhant ke kshetron se bhi sambandhit hai
 Three major areas of practice in ethics are recognized: isame vakilo ore apane pakshakaar ko jo bhi salaah di jaati he usee ke hisaab se pakshakaar kaam karata he 
 Rushworth Keyder states that "definitions of" ethics "have generally included phrases such as 'science of ideal human character' or 'science of moral duty'
 " richard wiliam paul or linda elder kii paribhaasha ke anusaar, nitishastra "ek sankalpanaaon or siddhanton kaa samucchy hai, jo, kaunsa vyavhaar samvedan-samarth jeevon kii madad karata hai yaa unhen nuqasaan pahunchataa hai, ye nirdhaarit karne main hamaara maargdarshan karata hai"
 The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy states that the term ethics "is commonly used interchangeably with 'morality' 'and is sometimes more narrowly used to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual"
 paul or elder kehete hai ki zyaadaatar log samjik prathaon, dharmik aasthaaon or vidhi inke anusaar vyavhaar karne or nitishastra ke madhya bhramit ho jate hai or nitishastra ko akeli sankalpana nahin maanate
 The term "ethics" has many meanings
 iskaa sandarbh darshanik nitishastra yaa naitik darshan se ho saktaa hai
 The behavior of man is studied in many scriptures from many perspectives
 maanavvyavahaar, prakruti ke vyapaaron kii bhaanti, kaary-kaaran-shrunkhlaa ke rup main hota he or uskaa karanmulak adhyayan evam vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 This is what psychology does
 kintu prakritik vyapaaron ko ham acha yaa bura kahkar visheshit nahin karte
 When we get wet due to sudden rain on the way, we do not say bad words to the clouds
 iske vipareet saathi manushyon ke karmon par ham baraabar bhale-bure kaa nirnay dete hai
 Thus the universal human tendency to pass judgment is the mother of ethics
 achaarshastra main ham vyavasthit rup se chintan karte hue yah jaanane kaa praytn karte hai ki hamaare achchhai-buraai ke nirnyon kaa buddhigrahya aadhaar kya he
 It is said that ethics is a regulatory or ideal science, while psychology is a theoretical science
 nishchay hi shastron ke is vargeekaran main kuch tathy he, par vah bhraamak bhi ho saktaa he
 The above classification may give rise to the notion that the work of ethics is not the exploration and inauguration of the rules of ethical behavior, but rather artificially inflating such rules on human society
 kintu yah dharna galat he
 The moral laws that ethics explores are inherent in the basic consciousness of man himself
 avashya hi yah chetana vibhinn samaajon tathaa yugon main vibhinn rup dhaaran karti dikhaai detii he
 The main reason for this diversity is the complexity of human nature and the diversity of human credit
 vibhinn deshkalon ke vichaarak apane samaajon ke prachlit vidhinishedhon main nihit naitik paimaanon kaa hi anveshan karte hai
 In our own era, due to the incorporation of many new old cultures, it may be possible for thinkers to rise above countless stereotypes and ambiguous beliefs, leading to the inauguration of virtually universal moral principles
 meta-nitishastra yah poochta hai ki ham isse kaise samajhate hai, iske bare main kaise jaanate hai or iskaa kya arth nikaalte hai, jab ham 'kya sahi hai' or 'kya galat hai' kii baat karte hai
 This is a positive squeeze of the problems going on in the mind
 mandandak nitishastra nitishastreey kriya kaa adhyayan hai
 It is that branch of ethics that examines a set of questions that originate when thinking how one should work ethically
 mandandak nitishastra meta-nitishastra se alag hai, kyonki yah kaaryon ke sahi yaa galat hone ke maanakon kaa parikshan karata hai, jabaki meta-nitishastra naitik bhashaa ke arth or naitik tathyon ke tatvamimasaa kaa adhyayan karata hai
 Critical ethics is also different from descriptive ethics, because there are empirical investigations into the moral beliefs of the posthumous people
 anya shabdon main, varnatmak nitishastra kaa sambandh yah nirdhaarit karne se hai ki kis anupaat ke log maanate hai ki hatya sadaiv galat hai, jabaki mandandak nitishastra kaa sambandh is baat se hai ki kya yah manyata rakhni galat hai
 Therefore, sometimes normative ethics is called normative rather than descriptive
 haalanki, meta-nitishastreey drushti ke kuch sanskarnon main jinhen naitik yatharthwaad kaha jaataa hai, naitik tathy ek hi vaqt par, donon varnatmak or nirdeshaatmak hote hai
 Traditional, normative ethics was the study of what makes an action what is right or wrong
 ye siddhanth mushkil naitik nirnyon kaa samaadhaan karne hetu vyapak naitik siddhanth pradaan karte hai
 Utilitarianism has always been a dominant view of humans
 yah vichaardhaara manushya ke aacharan ke us paksh ko parilakshith karti he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki == moral philosophy == manav jeevan me naitik sidhanton ko hi naitik darshan kehte hain raajnneetik nitishastra raajnneetik karrwai or raajnneetik agenton ke bare main naitik naitik nirnay lene kii pratha he
 Descriptive ethics is less inclined to the philosophical end of the screen because its purpose is to obtain specific information about how people live and to draw general conclusions based on vision patterns
 nitishastra kaa mul prashn kya he, is sambandh main do mahatvaparn mat paae jate hai
 According to one wish, the main problem of ethics is to tell what is the ultimate credit of human life
 param shrey kaa bodh ho jane par ham shubh karm unhen kahenge jo us shrey kii ore le janevaale hai; vipareet karmon ko ashubh kaha jayega
 According to the second wish, the main task of ethics is to clarify the notion of auspicious or religious
 duusare shabdon main, nitishastra kaa kaary us niyam yaa niyamsamooh kaa swaroop spasht karnaa he jis yaa jinke anusaar anushthit karm shubh athwa dharmik hote hai
 A
 Two intentions give rise to ideologies of two different categories
 param shrey kii kalpana anek prakaar se kii gai he; in kalpanaaon athwa siddhanton kaa varnan ham aage karenge
 Here we will discuss briefly how the rules of morality - if there are such rules - can be of any kind
 niyam yaa kanoon kii dharna yaa to rajya ke dandvidhaan se aati he yaa bhautik vigyaanon se, jahaan prakruti ke niyamon kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 State laws are created by the modifiable will of one type of ruler
 ve kabhi-kabhi kuch virgon ke hit ke liye banaae jate hai, unhen todaa bhi ja saktaa he or unke paalan se bhi kuch logon ko haani ho sakati he
 In contrast, the laws of nature are indivisible
 rajya ke niyam badale ja sakate hai, kintu prakruti ke niyam aparivartaneey hai
 The rules of policy or virtue are considered immutable, welfare for the follower and unenforceable
 in drushtiyon se nitishastra ke niyam swasthyavigyaan ke niyamon ke purnataya samaan hote hai
 It seems that man or human nature is spread under the control of two different categories of rules
 ek ore to manushya un kanoonon kaa vashwarti he jinka udghaatan yaa nirupan bhautik vigyaan, rasayanashastra, pranishastra, manovigyaan aadi tathyanveshi shastron main hota he or duusari ore swasthyavigyaan, tarkshastra aadi aadarshanveshi vigyaanon ke niyamon kaa, jinase vah baadhya to nahin hota, par jinka paalan uske sukh tathaa unnati ke liye aavashyak he
 The rules of ethics are of this second category
 nitishastra kii pramukh samasyaayein nimnlikhit he- We can divide the problems of ethics into three classes: param shrey ke bare main purv or pashchim main anek kalpanaayen kii gai hai
 Almost all philosophies in India believe that happiness is the ultimate goal of life, but most of them have a concept of happiness completely different from so-called euphemism
 is duusare yaa prachlit arth main ham keval charvak darshan ko saukhyavaadee kah sakate hai
 There is no systematic description of Charvak's moral intentions, but it is understood that in his euphemism, gross sensual pleasure is given importance
 bharat ke duusare darshan jis atyantik sukh ko jivan kaa lakshya kehete hai use apvarg, mukti yaa moksh athwa nirvana se samikrut kiya gaya he
 In the Nyaya and Samkhya Darshans, the category of exclusion or liberation is envisaged, it cannot be said to be an emotional pleasures but the liberation of the Upanishads and Vedanta can be said to be inward
 vedant kii mukti tathaa baudhon kaa nirvana, donon hi us sthiti ke dyotak hai jab vyakti kii aatma sukh du:kha aadi dwandvon se pare ho jaati he
 This condition can also come in lifetime; The pragya situated in the Bhagavad Gita is said to be a life-free one
 paashchaatya darshanon main param shrey ke sambandh main anek matvaad paae jate hai : There is also different scholasticism regarding what is the source or source of knowledge of our ultimate credit or good and inauspicious
 adhikansh pratyayvaadiyon ke mat main bhalaai-buraai ko bodh buddhi dwaara hota he
 This is the view of Hegel, Bradley etc
 and Kant's intent is also not opposed to it
 kaant maanate hai ki antat: hamaari krityabuddhi hi naitik aadarshon kaa strot he
 According to empiricists experience is the source of knowledge of our auspicious inauspiciousness
 yah mat naitik saapekshyatawad ko janm detaa he
 The third opinion is pratibhānavāda or up jhhvhjj)
 is mat ke anusaar hamaare bheetar ek aisi shakti he jo saakshaat dhang se shubh ashubh ko pahchaan yaa jaan leti he
 There are many forms of reflection
 shaiftsbari or hachesan naamak british darshanikon kaa vichaar tha ki rup ras aadi ko grahan karanevaali indriyon kii hi bhaanti hamaare bheetar ek naitik indriya bhi hoti he jo sidhe bhalaai buraai ko dekh leti he
 In the opinion of a thinker named Bishop Butler, we have a motivating instinct called Sadasadbuddhi which shows us the path of justification while resolving the duality between selfishness and altruism
 hamaare aacharan kii anek prerak vrittiyaan hai; ek vritti atmprem he, duusari par-hit-aakanksha 
 The place of Sadasadabuddhi is above these two, he is decisively distinguished above these two
 german vichaarak kaant kii gananaa pratibhanvaadiyon main bhi kii jaati he
 a common feature of conservative moral principles is that they do not consider it necessary to focus on the consequences of an action in order to decide the good of evil
 koi karm isliye shubh yaa ashubh nahin ban jaataa ki uske parinaam ek yaa duusari koti ke hai
 Or the preconception of all the results of a task is as difficult as it is to control them
 karm kii achchhai buraai uski prerana se nirdhaarit hoti he
 The karma that has an auspicious motivation at its core is satta karma, karma born in inauspicious inspiration is asatta karma or sin
 kaante kaa kathan he ki shubh sankalpabuddhi ek aisi cheez he jo swayan shreyrup he, jiskaa shreyatv nirpeksh evam nishchit he; shesh sab vastuon kaa shreyatv saapeksh hota he
 Only auspicious willpower is illuminated by its own form of light
 naitik shubh-ashubh ke gyaan kaa strot kya he, is sambandh main bhartiya vichaarkon ne bhi kai mat prakat kiye hai
 According to the Mimamsa philosophy, the ethics inspired by Shruti is dharma and the Karma prohibited by Shruti or Veda is unrighteousness
 is prakaar dharm evam adharm shrutiyon ke vidhi-nishedh-mulak hai
 Along with the teaching of Nishkam Karmayoga in the Bhagavad Gita, it has been said that the scripture is the proof for the knowledge of duty and duty
 shaastra ke antargat shruti tathaa smriti donon kaa pariganan hota he
 Different duties have been directed for each varna and ashram of Hinduism; a detailed discussion of these duties is found in the Dharmasutras and the Memoirs
 is koti ke kartavyon ke atirikt saamaanya dharm athwa saarvbhaum dharmaniyamon ke bodh ke liye ko bhi pramaan mana gaya he
 The ethos of gentlemen has been accepted as a pioneer
 naitik aacharan kii anivaaryta ke aadhaar bhi anek roopon main kalpit hue hai
 Religion has been the most important regulator of morality in the history of man
 hamen naitik niyamon kaa paalan karnaa chahie, kyonki vaisaa ishwar yaa dharmavyavastha ko isht he
 The second regulatory power of ethics is the state
 logon ko aniatik kaaryon se virat karne main rajagna ek mahatvapurn hetu hoti he
 Similarly, fear of society also gives power to moral rules
 kaant ke anusaar hamen swayan dharm ke liye dharm karnaa chahie; kartavyapaalan swayan apane main isht yaa saadhy vastu he
 Those thinkers who preserve duty and duty with the expectation of supreme sacrifice can say that the motivation of moral conduct is basically the motivation for self-promotion
 ham shubh karm karte hai, kyonki vaisaa karne se ham apane param shrey kii ore pragati karte hai
 An important problem of ethics is whether man is free to act? When we call a person good for any of his or her actions, then we clearly consider him responsible for that work, which means that there is a hidden belief that that person was free not to do the work under consideration
 kaant kehete hai : chunki mujhe karnaa chahie, isliye main kar saktaa hoon
 This means that a system of moral living and moral evaluation is not possible without respecting the freedom of the subject
 ham prakruti ke vyapaaron ko bhala bura nahin kehete, keval manushya ke karmon par hi vaisaa nirnay dete hai; isse jaan padataa he ki prakritik tathaa maanviya vyapaaron main kuch antar he
 This difference is due to human freedom
 kisi kriya ke anushthan ko ichha kaa vishay banane na banane main manushya kii sankalpabuddhi swatantra he
 The above opinion is not acceptable to the determinants of determinism
 bhautik vigyaan batalaata he ki vishvabrahmad main sarvatra kaary-kaaran-niyam kaa akhand shashan he
 Each present event is determined by the past
 sampurna vishwa ek brihat kaary-kaaran-parampara he
 All types of events are subject to unbroken rules
 aisi dasha main yah kaise mana ja saktaa he ki manushya sankalp vikalp tathaa vyapaar akaaran evam niyamaheen hote hai? manushya ke kriyakalapon ko vishwa ke ghatnasmooh main apvaadrup nahin mana ja saktaa
 If on many occasions we cannot make a successful prediction regarding human trades, then the reason for this is incomplete knowledge of the regulatory rules of those trades, not the rulelessness of those trades
 nirdharanwad ke siddhant ko bhautik shastron se bal mila he; use prakrutijagat kii yantravaadi vyakhya se bhi avlamb miltaa he
 But this does not mean that determinism is a physical theory
 kaha gaya he ki spinoja tathaa hegel ke darshanon main vyakti kii swatantraaa ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 In Sankhya philosophy, Purush is considered to be nirgun and passive
 samast karmon ko buddhi main aropit kiya gaya he or buddhi ko teen gunon se sanchalit batalaaya gaya he
 It is written in the Gita - All the work is done by the three qualities of nature, ego man considers himself the doer
 gita main hi prayek karm ke sankhyasmmat paanch kaaran ginaae gaye hai, arthath adhishthan, katrta, karan, vividh cheshtaayen or daiv; aisi dasha main keval karm ke liye uttaradaayi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Some thinkers like Mackenzie etc
 hold the principle of self-determination apart from the above two opinions
 jahaan manushya swatantraaa kii bhaavana se karm karata he, vahaan karm swayan uske vyaktitv main nihit shaktiyon dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 In this sense man is free
 bure kaam ke baad utpann honevaali pashchaattap kii bhaavana karta kii swatantraaa siddh karti he
 Iran - Israel relations have been a sweet relationship since ancient times, but Iran is a Muslim nation, Israel is a Jewish nation
 After the revolution, Iran is an enemy of Israel and presently as an enemy
 19 november 1947 main sanyukt raashtra sangh kii mahasabha nefilistin ko arab or yahudee kshetron main baantne ke prastaav ko paarit kiya or is tarah se america vabritain kii madad se philistin main israel raashtra ban gaya jiske baad mushe sharatuk ne iran ke tatkaaleen videshmantri ko telegraph kiya or apane is telegraph main hajaaron varsh pehle sires mahaan dwaara yahudiyon ko bachaane kii ghatana kaa varnan karte hue iran kii shahi sarkaar se apil kii ki vah israel ko manyata de or sires kii mahanata ko yahudihayon ke liye dohraye

 The imperial government of Iran proposed to sell oil to Israel, which Israel quickly accepted as the Arab countries boycotted it, when Egypt's president Gamal Abd al-nasir announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal, and Israel announced Britain And with the French army invading Egypt, the oil transaction between Iran and Israel increased
 1957 main iran kii shahi sarkaar or israel ke madhya gupt vaarta hui or donon ke bich ek dollars tees saint prati bairal tel ke samjhaute par hastakshar hue
 Iran's oil became extremely important to Israel under the orders of the then Prime Minister of Israel, David bin Gorean, laying a network of pipelines on Israeli ports
 san 1959 main iran pratidin tees hazaar bairal tel israel ko detaa tha jo san 1971 main pacchaavnev hazaar bairal pratidin tak pahunch gaya
 Iran was the largest supplier of oil to Israel, and apart from this, relations between Iran and Israel were widespread in almost every region and Israeli politicians and intellectuals repeatedly reminded the King of Iran that he was the breed of Cyrus the Great
 Is one who had captured the entire Jewish race two and a half thousand years ago

 Not only this, the government formed after the success of the Islamic Revolution in Iran took a very important step in support of Palestine which certainly became a ray of hope for the Palestinians

 The Islamic Revolution was successful in Iran on 11 February 1979, and a week after that, the Palestinian Embassy was opened in a program called Yasir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Front
 philistin kaa duutavas usee imaarat main kholaa gaya jisamen shahi sarkaar ke kaal main israel kaa duutavas tha
 Shortly after the success of the revolution in Iran, the people captured the Israeli embassy in Tehran and put a Palestinian embassy there, the then Israeli ambassador to Iran, Yusuf Harmlin, hid in an unknown place in Iran with his thirty-three employees Later, US Defense Minister Harlod Brown traveled to the Middle East and during this time, his efforts led to the exit of Iran

 louh ayask ve chattaane or khanij hai jinase dhatvik louh kaa aarthik nishkarshan kiya ja saktaa he
 These ores usually contain high amounts of iron oxides and can range in color from dark gray, bright yellow, dark purple, and rust red
 louh aamtaur par magnetit, hametit, joithait ), lymonite 
 n), or siderite, is found as
 hametit ko "prakritik ayask" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The name dates back to the early years of mining, when specific haematite ores contained 66% iron and were directly dumped into iron-making blast furnaces
 louh ayask kaccha maal he, jiskaa upyog pig aayran banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo ispaat banane ke liye banane main kaam aata he
 In fact, it has been argued that iron ore is "probably more integral to the global economy than any other commodity, except oil
" " The presence of metallic iron on the surface of the earth is virtually unknown, but it is found in iron – nickel alloys found from meteors and sometimes in deep mantle xenoliths
 isliye, maanav udyogon ke dwaara kaam main liye jane vaale louh ke sabhi strot louh oxide khanij hi hote hai, udyog main kaam main liye jane vaala praarambhik rup hametit he
 However, in some situations, low-grade sources of iron ore were used by industrialized societies when high-grade hematite ore was not available
 isamen shaamil he, sanyukt rajya america main dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad taconite kaa upyog or america kranti or nepolian ke yuddh ke dauraan joithait or yaa bog ayask kaa upyog
 In prehistoric society, latrite was used as a source of iron ore
 magnetic kaa upyog aksar isliye kiya jaataa he kyonki yah chumbakeey hota he or isliye ise geng se aasaani se mukt kiya ja saktaa he
 Low-grade sources of iron ore usually require purification
 silikets ke saapeksh hametit ke ucch ghanatv ke kaaran, shuddhikaran ke liye aamtaur par ise chote tukdon main toda jaataa he, iske baad ise pisa jaataa he or baari taral pruthakkaran kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 For this, well-grounded ore is fed over a solution containing bentonite or some other agent, thereby increasing the density of the solution
 jab vilyan kaa ghanatv upyukt str tak pahunch jaataa he, hametit dub jaataa he or silicket khanij sataha par tairne lagata he or ise sataha se hataa kar alag kiya ja saktaa he
 Iron ore mining methods depend on the type of ore
 vartmaan main chaar mukhya prakaar ke louh ayask bhandar paae jate hai, jo ayask ke bhandar ke bhu vigyaan or khanij vigyaan par nirbhar karte hai
 These are magnetite, titenomagnetite, passive hematite and pisolitic ironstone deposits
 bandhit louh kaa nirmaan ) kayantarit avsaadee chattaanon se hota he jo mukhya rup se louh khanij or silica kii patali paraton se bani hoti hai
 The iron mineral present in it may be carbonate siderite, but the mineral used as iron ore contains oxide magnetite or hematite
 bandhit louh nirmaan ko uttari america main taconite ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 BIF mining involves extensive crushing and screening, followed by fine-graining with crushing, allowing the ore to be in such a state that the crystallized magnetite and quartz become so fine that when the resulting powder is placed in a magnetic separator The quartz is left behind when it flows through
 khanan kii prakriya main ayask or vyarth padaarthon kii badi maatra kii gatividhiyaan shaamil hai
 The waste is in two forms, the rocks from the mine which are not ores, which is called mulok, and the undesired mineral which itself is the inner part of the ore, which is called geng
 mulok ko khan se nikaal kar vyarth padaarth ke rup main alag kar diya jaataa he or geng ko shuddhikaran yaa parishkaran kii prakriya ke dauraan alag kiya jaataa he or avshesh ke rup main ayask main se hataaya jaataa he
 Taconite residues are mostly mineral quartz, which are chemically inert
 is saamagree ko bade, viniyamit sthir pani ke talabon main sangrahit kar liya jaataa he
 The main points that make magnetite economically useful are the crystalline properties of magnetite, the range of iron in BIF nutrient rocks, and the contaminating elements present in concentrated magnetite
 adhikansh magnetit sroton kaa aakaar or pattee anupaat apraasangik hota he kyonki BIF kaa nirmaan sainkadon meter motaa hota he, isamen sainkadon kilometre kii paraten hoti hai, jisamen aasaani se 2,500 million yaa adhik ton ayask ho saktaa he
 The typical range of iron in which magnetite is economically suitable with bonded iron formation is roughly 25% Fe
 jisase saamanyatya 33% se 40% magnetit kii prapti kii ja sakati he, jo 64% sandrit louh kaa utpaadan kar saktaa he
 0 in typical concentrated magnetite iron ore
 1%se kam phosphorus, 3–7% silica or 3% se kam aluminium hota he
 The size of the magnetite particles and its fraction according to the mass of the silica determines the extent to which the rock is crushed so that the magnetic separation process can be carried out effectively to provide a high-purity concentrated magnetite
 isse yah nirdhaarit hota he ki ek milling prakriya ke liye kitni maatra main urja kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Typically, most magnetite BIF deposits are powdered so that the size of the particles varies from 32 to 45 micrometers, so that concentrated magnetite with less silica can be obtained
 sandrit magnetic main saamanyatya bhaar kaa 63% Fe hota he or aamtaur par kam phosphorus, kam aluminium, kam titanium or kam silica hote hai or ek premium keemat par isaki maang hoti he
 Currently magnetite iron ore is mined in the United States in Minnesota and Michigan, and taconite is mined in eastern Canada
 BIF se yukt magnetic kaa khanan vartmaan main vishesh rup se brazil main kiya jaataa he, jo kaaphi adhik maatra main ise asia ko niryaat kar detaa he or australia main ek nayaa or bada magnetit louh ayask udyog he
 Sometimes granite and ultrapotasic igneous rocks separate magnetite crystals and form magnetite bodies economically suitable for concentrating
 louh ke kuch bhandar, khaskar jo chile main hai, jwalamukhi ke pravaah se banate hai, jinamein magnetit ke lakshan praaroop crystalon kaa sangrah hota he
 Chile's iron ore deposits in the Atacama Desert create alluvial accumulations of magnetite in streams emanating from these volcanic formations

 Another minor source of iron ore is the accumulation of magma that freezes in layers, which typically contain magnetite ore containing titanium along with vanadium
 ye ayask ek aalaa darje kaa bazaar banaate hai, jinamein louh, titanium or venedium ke nishkarshan ke liye vishesh prakaar ke pragalkon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The purification of these ores is essentially similar to that of bonded iron manufacturing ores, but they can usually be refined more easily by crushing and screening
 praroopik sandrit titanomagnetit main 57% Fe, 12% Ti or 0
 5% is V2O5
 hametit louh ayask ke bhandar vartmaan main sabhi mahadwipon main prayukt kiye jate hai, inkaa sabase adhik upyog dakshin america, australia or asia main kiya jaataa he
 Most of the large hematite iron ore deposits are bonded iron formations produced by metamorphic conversion and can sometimes contain igneous deposits
 hametit louh aamtaur par BIF se yukt magnetit yaa anya chattaanon kii tulana main kam miltaa he, jo iskaa mukhya strot yaa protolith chattan banaate hai, parantu isse louh kaa nishkarshan sasta padataa he, kyonki isamen louh avyav kii ucch maatra hoti he, isliye ise shuddhikaran yaa parishkaran kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 However, hematite ores are harder than magnetite ores and therefore require more energy to crush and grind if purification is required
 hametit ayskon main anya avyavon kii ucch sandratha bhi ho sakati he, inamen praroopik rup se shaamil hai, phosphorus kii ucch maatra, jal or aluminium 
 Hematite ores of the export category are generally in the 62–64% Fe range
 china || 820 Iron is the most commonly used metal in the world, it is mainly used as steel, with iron ore being the main ingredient, which makes up about 95% of all metals used annually
 iskaa upyog mukhu rup se sanrachanaatmak abhiyantriki anuprayogon main or samudri prayojanon, automobiles or saamaanya audyogic anuprayogon main kiya jaataa he
 Iron or iron-rich rocks are found all over the world, but commercial mining activities of the ore category are mainly seen in a few countries, which are listed in the table
 louh ayask ke bhandar ke liye arthshaastra main mukhya baadha aavashyak rup se bhandar kii shrenee yaa aakaar nahin he, kyonki maujuud chattaanon ke paryaapt ton main bhaar ko bhu-vaigyanik rup se pramanit karne ke liye yah vishesh rup se sakht nahin he
 The main constraint is the relative position of iron ore in the market, the cost of rail infrastructure to bring it to market, and the cost of energy required to do so
 louh ayask kaa khanan ek adhik maatra main hone vaala kam laabh kaa vyapaar he, kyonki louh kii keemat aadhaar dhaatuon se bahut kam hoti he
 It takes a lot of capital and requires a lot of investment for railways like infrastructure, as it is used to transport ore from mine to ship
 inhen kaarnon se, louh ayask utpaadan kuch mukhya khiladiyon ke haathon main kendrit he
 The world produces an average of one billion metric tons of raw ore annually
 duniya kaa sabase bada louh ayask kaa utpaadak brazilian mining corporation wel he, jiske baad aglaa sthaan anglo-australian companiyon BHP bilitan or rio tinto group kaa he
 Another Australian supplier, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, has helped bring Australia's production to second place in the world
 louh ayask samudr se hone vaala vyapaar, arthath, vah louh ayask jise jahaazon ke dwaara anya deshon ko le jaaya jaataa tha, vah 2004 main 849m ton tha
 Australia and Brazil dominate the maritime trade, making up 72 percent of the market
 BHP, rio or wel unke bich bazaar ke 66% par niyantran karte hai
 Iron ore in Australia is sourced from three main sources: Pisolite "channel iron deposits" ores originate from the mechanical erosion of primary bonded-iron formation and accumulate in alluvial channels such as Panavonica, Western Australia; And effective metamorphic bonded ironmaking-related ores such as Neumann, Chichester Range, Hummersley Range and Cullianobing, in Western Australia
 ayask ke anya prakaar bhi haal hi main saamne aaye hai, jaise oxikrut ferugines hardcaps, udhaaharan ke liye pashchimi australia main argyle jhil ke najadik letrit ayask ke bhandar
 The total recoverable reserves of iron ore in India are approximately 9602 million tonnes of hematite and 3408 million tonnes of magnetite
 madhya pradesh, karnataka, bihar, urisa, goa, maharashtra, andhra pradesh, kerala, rajasthan or tamilnadu louh ayask ke mukhya bhartiya utpaadak hai
 World consumption of iron ore is increasing by 10% annually
 Its main consumers are China, Japan, Korea and the United States and the European Union
 china vartmaan main louh ayask kaa sabase bada upabhokta he, jo duniya kaa sabase bada ispaat utpaadak desh he
 It is also the largest importer, which procured 52% of maritime trade of iron ore in 2004
 china ke baad aglaa sthaan japan or korea kaa he jo kachche louh ayask or dhaatukarm ke koyale kii kaaphi maatra kaa upbhog karte hai
 In 2006, China produced 588 million tonnes of iron ore, with an annual increase of 38%
 pichley 40 varshon main, louh ayask kii keemton ko, khanankartaaon or ispaat nirmaataaon ke bich, ek tathakthith benchmark pranali ke dwaara nirdhaarit kiya gaya he
 Traditionally, the first deal between these two groups set a benchmark that was followed by the rest of the industry
 is prakaar se, ek hi keemat par prati varsh ek baar baatcheet kii jaati he
 a spot market also exists, although it is traditionally much smaller
 is pranali ke saath samasya yah he ki jab spot keemten benchmark se zyada hoti hai, khanankartaaon ko atirikt rajasav nahin mil paata, jo ayask ko spot bazaar main bech kar kamaaya gaya hota he
 When spot prices are lower than the benchmark, some steel mills cheat by purchasing their ore from the spot market
 duusare shabdon main, benchmark pranali steel milon ko suraksha pradaan karti he lekin khanankartaaon ko nahin
 On the other hand, the benchmark system brings price stability for miners and steel mills, allowing them to plan their production more effectively
 haal hi ke varshon main, benchmark pranali tuutane lagi he, kyonki kuch khanankarta apane graahakon ko spot bazaar kaa upyog karne ke liye prerit karte hai or sabase bade khariddaar, china, ke saath baatcheet gharshan kaa kaaran banati he
 Because the size and importance of the spot market has greatly increased, a means of avoiding financial constraints such as swaps in iron ore has arisen
 yah dekhte hue ki adhikansh anya thok kii vasteen ek bazaar aadhaarit mulya pranali ke rup main saamne aayin hai, yah ek uchit shart he ki louh ayask madhyam se lambi avadhi main isi path kaa anusaran karegaa
 However, in some cases, the cost of shipping exceeds the value of the ore
 yah vishesh rup se brazil ke louh ayask ke liye praasangik he, jise australian louh ayask kii tulana main china tak pahunchane ke liye adhik yatra kerani padati he
 Therefore, in the past Australian manufacturers argued for a premium on their ore, the reason being that it is too cheap to ship
 vartmaan main louh ayask ke bhandar kaaphi vishaal hai, parantu kuch logon kaa kahana he ki jis dar se iske upbhog main nirantar ghaateey vruddhi ho rahi he, isse yahaan tak ki is sansaadhan ke strot bhi simit ho sakate hai
 For example, World Watch Institute Lester Brown suggests that iron ore will last only 64 years, based on a very conservationist assessment, with an increase of 2% per year
 louh ayask main oxigen or louh ke parmaanu paraspar anu ke rup main bandhit hote hai
 It has to be smelled to convert it into metallic iron and it has to undergo a direct reduction process to remove oxygen from it
 oxigen-louh bandha bahut prabal hote hai or oxigen se louh ko alag karne ke liye, ek adhik prabal tatv kaa bandhan upasthit hona chahie jo oxigen ko apane saath jod sake
 Carbon is used for this because at higher temperatures the predominance of the carbon – oxygen bond is higher than that of the iron – oxygen bond
 is prakaar se, louh ayask ko pis kar coke ke saath milaayaa jaataa he or pragalan prakriya main ise jalaayaa jaataa he
 However, it is not as easy as it looks; Oxygen separating from iron first forms carbon mono oxide
 is prakaar se, louh or carbon ke pragalan kii prakriya ek alp oxigen kii avasthaa main kii jaati he jisase carbon jal kar cobanaye naaki CO2
 Even the very small amount of some elements found affects the behavior or smelting activity of iron ore greatly
 ye prabhaav achche bhi ho sakate hai or bure bhi, kuch to bahut adhik bure ho sakate hai
 Some chemicals, such as flux, are mixed deliberately to make the blast furnace action more effective
 anya ko isliye milaayaa jaataa he ve louh ko adhik taral banaate hai, yaa ise koi or vaanchhneeya gun dete hai
 The choice of ore, fuel, and fluxes determines how the slag behaves and what the characteristics of the iron produced will be
 adarsh rup se louh ayask main keval louh or oxigen hi hote hai
 In fact, this is rarely seen
 aamtaur par, louh ayask main kai tatv hote hai, jo aadhunik steel main aksar avaanchit hote hai
 Silica is almost always found in iron ore
 isamen se adhikansh silica pragalan kii prakriya main dhaatumal ke rup main alag ho jaataa he
 At temperatures above 1300 °, some get reduced and it alloys with iron
 bhatti jitani garm hoti he, louh main utana hi adhik silicon hota he
 1 in 16th to 18th century European cast iron
 5% tak silicon kaa paaya janaa asaamaanya nahin he
 The major effect of silicon is that it promotes the manufacture of gray iron
 dhoosar louh kam bhangur hota he or safed louh kii tulana main ise finnish dena aasaan hota he
 That is why it is preferred in the casting process
 Turner kii report ke anusaar silicon sankuchan ko bhi kam karata he, iske thanda hone ke samay nikalne vaali gas se hone vaale chhedon ko kam karata he or dhalaai ko adhik behatar banataa he
 Phosphorus has four major effects on iron: it increases its hardness and strength, lowers the temperature of solids, increases fluidity, helps in quick cooling
 louh kaa upyog kis prayojan ke liye kiya jayega, is aadhaar par yah acha yaa bura prabhaav daal saktaa he
 Bog ores often contain high amounts of phosphorus
 phosphorus ke sandran ke saath louh kii prabalata or kathorta bad jaati he
 0 in pig iron
 05% phosphorus ise madhyam carbon steel jaisaa kathor banaata he
 Iron containing more phosphorus can be hardened with hammers in cold
 phosphorus ke kisi bhi sandran ke liye kathorta kaa prabhaav sach he
 The more it contains phosphorus, the more iron becomes harder and can be made more rigid by hammers
 aadhunik ispaat nirmaataa kathorta ko 30% tak badha sakate hai, iske liye unhen phosphorus ke str ko 0
 07 and 0
 12% ke bich banaaye rakhana hota he or saath hi louh aghat rodhi bhi bana rahata he
 This further increases hardness due to quenching, but also reduces the solubility of carbon in iron at high temperatures
 yah blistor yaa fafoledaar ispaat ke nirmaan main isaki upyogita ko kam karata he, jahaan carbon ke avasorana kii maatra or gati bahut mahatvapurn hoti he
 There is also a low side of phosphorus found in iron
 0
 Iron is rapidly cooled over short periods when found in concentrations greater than 2%, or becomes brittle at low temperatures
 jaldi thanda hona vishesh rup se louh kii chadi main mahatvapurn he
 However, rod iron is usually used for heating, but must be hardened, easily bendable, and must also be shock resistant at room temperature
 ek keel jo ki ek hathode kii maar se tukade tukade hokar bikhar jaataa he yaa ek pahiyaa jo ek chattan se takaraa tut jaataa he, use bechney par acchhee keemat nahin milegi
 High concentrations of phosphorus can make any iron unusable
 jaldi thanda hone ke prabhaav taapmaana ke saath bad jate hai
 In this way, a piece of iron, which is completely useful in summer, can become very brittle in winter
 is baat ke pramaan hai ki madhya yug ke dauraan bahut amir log garmiyon main ucch phosphorus se yukt talwaar rakhte the or sardiyon main kam phosphorus se yukt talwaar rakhte the
 Careful control of phosphorus can be very beneficial in the casting process
 phosphorus taralata ke taapmaana ko kam karata he, jisase iquidus taapmaana depresses, loha ab or bad jaati he pighla hua dravtaa ke liye rahane ke liye anumati detaa he
 Increase of 1% volume would take the molten iron to double the distance

 There are two treatments for high phosphorus iron
 purana he or aasaan, parihaar he
 If the iron produced by someone cools down quickly, it will find a near source of iron ore
 duusari vidhi main shaamil he louh oxide mila kar khanan kii prakriya ke dauraan phosphorus ko oxikrut kar dena
 This technique is generally related to puddling in the 19th century, which was probably not understood early
 udhaaharan ke liye marlboro aayran ke maalik ijak zaane ise 1772 main nahin jaan paae
 Zane is said to have been reputed for modern development, a technique unknown even to the Iron Masters of Virgina and Pennsylvania
 phosphorus ek hanikaarak sandushak he, kyonki yah ispaat ko bhangur banaata he, chaahe 0
 Only present in small concentrations of 6%
 phosphorus ko flux yaa pragalan kii sahaayta se aasaani se hataaya nahin ja saktaa or isliye louh ayask par kaam karne ke liye isamen phosphorus kii maatra kam honi chahie
 The iron pillar of India which does not rust is preserved by phosphoric composition
 phosphoric acid kaa upyog jang roopantarak ke rup main kiya gaya he, kyonki phosphoric louh oxikaran ke liye kam samvedansheel he
 Small amounts of aluminum are present in many ores and some lime stones
 pehle vaale ko hataane ke liye ayask ko pragalan se pehle dhoyaa jaataa he
 Before being put into a brick-lined furnace, aluminum contamination was so low that it had no effect on iron or clinker
 haalanki, jab bhattiyon ke tal or blast fernence ke astr aantarik banane ke liye eenton kaa upyog shuru hua, aluminium kii maatra naatakeey rup se bad gayi
 This was due to erosion of the internal level of the furnace by clinker
 aluminium kaa apchayan karnaa bahut mushkil hota he
 As a result, aluminum contamination of iron is not a problem
 haalanki, yah dhaatumal kii viscasita yaa shyanta ko badhaata he
 This has many adverse effects on the operation of the furnace
 ghanaa dhaatumal dhire aaweshit hoga or isse is prakriya main lagane vaala samay bad jayega
 Higher amounts of aluminum will also cause problems in removing the liquefied clinker
 charam par yah ek jami hui bhatti kaa karan banegaa
 Sinters containing more aluminum contain many solutions
 pehla he roak paanaa; adhik aluminium se yukt strot main ayask yaa chooney ke strot kaa upyog naa karen
 Viscosity will decrease as the ratio of lime flux increases
 sulfur yaa gandhak koyale main aksar paaya jane vaala ek sandooshak he
 It is found in small amounts in many ores, but can be removed by calcification
 louh ke pragalan main upasthit taapmaana par gandhak louh kii drav or thos donon avasthaaon main jaldi se pigal jaataa he
 The effects of very small amounts of sulfur or sulfur are immediate and severe
 in par sabase pehle louh nirmaataaon ke dwaara kaam kiya gaya
 Sulfur makes iron red and it heats up quickly
 louh jab jaldi garm hota he, to vah garm avasthaa main bhangur hota he
 This was a serious problem because the iron used during the 17th and 18th centuries was cast iron or bar iron
 dhalwaan louh ko aakaar dene ke liye garm avasthaa main baar baar hathode se peeta jaataa he
 a quickly heated iron piece will break when hit by a hammer
 jab garm lohe yaa steel kaa koi tukda tut jaataa he to khuli sataha turant oxikrut ho jaati he
 This layer of oxide hinders the repair of cracks by welding
 badi daraaren lohe yaa steel ke tut jane kaa kaaran banati hai
 Due to small cracks, the object cannot be used in time
 yah kitna jaldi garm hota he, yah upasthit gandhak kii maatra par nirbhar karata he
 0 currently
 03% se adhik sulfur se yukt louh kaa upyog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Quickly heated iron can work, but it works at low temperatures
 kam taapmaana par kaam karne ke liye smith yaa formen se adhik bhautik prayaas kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is more difficult to obtain a metal to achieve such a result
 ek alp gandhak se yukt baar kaam kar saktaa he, parantu iske liye adhik samay or prayaas kii zarurat hoti he
 Sulfur in cast iron promotes the formation of white iron
 keval 0
 Due to volume up to 5% it slowly cools down and high amount of silicon
 safed kaccha loha adhik bhangur hota he, lekin yah sakht bhi hota he
 This is generally avoided, as it is difficult to work on, except in China where cast iron containing high amounts of sulfur is 0

 shesh duniya main ucch sulfur se yukt kaccha louh dhalaai main kaam aa saktaa he, lekin yah buree gunvattta kaa dhalwaan louh banayega
 There are several methods of treating sulfur contamination
 pehla or itihaas main sabase zyada prayukt kiye jane vaala pragaitihaasik tarika he isse bachanaa
 Unlike China, coal was not used as a fuel for ignition in Europe, because it contains sulfur and therefore iron is quickly heated
 agar ek ayask se aisa dhaatu banataa he jo jaldi garm hota he, to yranmaster kisi duusare kii khoj karenge
 When mineral coal was first used in the European Blast Furnace in 1709, coke is added to it
 1829 se garm blast kii shuruyaat se pehle kachche koyale kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 Sulfur can be removed from the ore by roasting and washing
 bharjan se safar oxikrut ho jaataa he, jisase sulfur dioxide kaa nirmaan hota he, jo yaa to vaataavaran main ud jaataa he yaa ise dho kar hataaya ja saktaa he
 In hot climates it is possible that pyritic ore is released in the rainy season
 barsaat, jeevanu or ushma ke sanyukt prabhaav se sulphide oxikrut hokar sulphate banaate hai, jo pani main ghulansheel hai
 Although, historically, iron sulfide, a common iron mineral, was not used as an ore for the production of ferrous metals
 prakritik apkshay kaa upyog sweden main kiya jaataa tha
 This process, at geological speed, produces gossan limonite ore
 kam sulfur se yukt louh kaa mahatva nirantar unche mulyon ke dwaara pradarshit hota he, jiske liye 16 veen se 18 veen shatabdi se sweden, rus or spain ke louh ke bhugtan ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 Sulfur is currently not a problem
 aadhunik upachaar he mangneej kaa atirikt hona he
 However, the operator must know how much sulfur is in the iron, because five times the manganese must be added to it, so that it can discharge it
 kuch aitihaasik louh mangneej ke str ko disple karte hai, lekin adhikansh sulfur ko niraveshit karne ke liye aavashyak str se kam hote hai
