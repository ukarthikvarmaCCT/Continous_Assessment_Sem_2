 It includes all the leela-places of Lord Krishna like Mathura, Vrindavan, Govardhan, Gokul, Mahaban, Valdev, Nandgaon, Varsana, Deeg and Kamban etc
 ukt braj kii seemaa ko churaasi kos mana gaya he
 Devoted poets and interlocutors of Surdas and other Vrajbhasha called Braj the ghetto in the adjacent forest area of mathura on the emulation of the Bhagavata Purana, and have given it a different meaning from 'mathura', 'madhupuri' or 'madhuvan'
 braj kshetra main aane vaale pramukh nagar ye hai- mathura, jalesar, bharatpur, agra, hathras, dhaulpur, aligarh, itawa, mainpuri, eta, kasganj, or firozabad
 The word Braj is derived from the Sanskrit metal 'vraj', meaning mobility
 jahaan gaay charati hai or vicharan karti hai vah sthaan bhi braj kaha gaya he
 The author of Amarkosh has given three meanings of Braj - Gotha, Marg and Vrind

 In the Bhagavatakar's view, Gostha, Gokul and Braj are synonyms
 bhagwat ke aadhaar par surdaas kii rachanaaon main bhi braj isi arth main prayukt hua he
 Mathura and its adjacent land has been famous for its dense forests, extensive pastures, cows and beautiful cows since ancient times

 From the mythological period to the emergence of the Vaishnava cults, as Krishnopasana expanded, so did the glory of the above mentioned traditions of Sri Krishna and his Leela places
 is kaal main yahaan go-paalan kii prachurtaa thi, jiske kaaran vrajakhandon kii bhi prachurtaa ho gai thi
 That is why Mathura, the birthplace of Shri Krishna and the entire region around Mathura connected with his pastimes, was called Braj or Brajmandal
 is prakaar braj shabd kaa kaal-krmanusaar arth vikaas hua he
 During the Vedas and the ramayana-mahabharata, where it was used for small places like 'gostha' - 'go-sthan'

 trager island scottish lekhak robert lui stivension kaa ek dussahasik upanyaas he, jo "samudri daaku or gade sone" kii kahani kahata he
 First published in a book form in 1883, it was originally published in the children's magazine Young Fox between 1881–82 under the title Treasure Island or Mutiny of the Hispaniola and the pseudo Captain George North
 paramparaagat rup se ise bhavishyakaalin kahani ke liye mana jaataa he, yah ek dussahik kahani he jo apane maahaul, charitra or karrwai or saath naitikta kii aspashtataa par vyangypurna tippanee ke liye janaa jaataa he - jaisaa ki long jon silver main dekha gaya - jo ki tab or ab bhi bal sahitya ke liye asaadhaaran he
 It is the most dramatic of all the novels so far

 Stevenson was thirty years old when he began writing Treasure Island and became his first success as a novelist
 shuru ke pandrah adhyyon 1881 main scotland ke parvatiy kshetra bramer main likhe gaye
 It was a rainy winter that began in the last days of summer and Stevenson was vacationing at the cottage with his family members
 stivension ke sautele yuva bete loyad osbern ne jal rang se barsaat ke din kii painting banaayi
 un dinon kii yaad karte hue loyad ne likhaa he: Within three days of drawing the map for Lloyd, Stevenson wrote the first three chapters, reading each one out loud to his family, who added some suggestions to it
 Lloyd insists that the woman is non-existent in the story, with the exception of Jim Hawkins' mother being largely excluded at the beginning of the book
 stivension ke pita bacchon kii tarah kahani main khush hue or billy bons ke samudri sandook kii sateek saamagree ke bare main likhte hue unhone ek din bitaayaa, jise stivension ne hu-ba-hu le liya; or jahaan gym hockins seve ke peepe main chhipata he, yah unke pita kaa suzav tha
 a friend, Dr
 Alexander Zapp, reached the editor of Young Fox magazine two weeks later with the opening chapter, with the editor agreeing to publish a chapter every week
 stivension lagaataar pandrah dinon tak ek din main ek adhyay kii dar se likhte gaye, iske baad sehat ke kaaran shabdon kaa ekadam se akaal pad gaya
 He had never earned anything till the age of thirty-one and was desperate to finish the book
 unhone pruf padhaa, usamen sudhaar kiya, subah akele tahalne nikle or anya upanyaason ko padhaa
 Having come to Scotland in the autumn, Stevenson left the summer vacation and moved back to London, and Stevenson was troubled by a chronic respiratory disease that had long been life

 During October 1882 to January 1882, Young Fox initially failed to attract readers' attention to Treasure Island or even to increase magazine sales, but it became very popular in 1883 when it was sold in book form

 He had also sent the map along with his manuscript to the book's publisher and it was later said that the map had been lost somewhere
 unke paas koi prati nahin thi, isse ve dukhi ho gaye
 For Stevenson, the map redrawn with memories and references with Ukkhat did not resemble the original Treasure Island

 Lloyd Osborne described him as "

 a great, enthusiastic, broad-shouldered man with a big beard and a crutch; cheerful, wonderfully clever and with a laugh like a man playing music; one of them There was unimaginable fire and vitality; they would turn anyone around on one foot "
 In a letter sent to Henley after the publication of Treasure Island, Stevenson wrote, "now i would like to make an admission
 It was your vision of crippling power and pride that gave birth to Long John Silver 


 the imagination, thought and the cripple Horror by sound, it is all taken from you completely
 " Stevenson had never encountered real pirates: the "golden period of pirates" had ended more than a century before he was born
 haalanki, naukayan or navikon tathaa samudri jivan ke bare main unka vivaran bahut vishwasaneey he
 His father and grandfather were both lighthouse engineers and often traveled around Scotland to inspect the lighthouses, taking Tarun Robert with him
 He crossed the Atlantic Ocean two years before writing Treasure Island
 unke vivaran itane pramanik the ki 1890 main wiliam butler yiats ne stivension se kaha ki trager island ekmaatr pustak he jisase unke samudr yatri dadaji ko koi kushi mili
 "the impact of Treasure Island on our perception of pirates cannot be called overvaluation
 Stevenson forever associated pirates with a legged sailor with maps, black mast, tropical islands, and parrots on his feet
 The mark of x with the treasure map in place of the buried treasure is a very familiar material of the pirate story ", yet it is completely e

 The novel is divided into 6 parts and 34 chapters: except for chapters 16–18 described by Doctor Livesey, Jim Hawkins narrates the rest
 upanyaas kaa prarambh madhya 18veen sadi main dakshin-pashchim england ke ek samudr tateey gaanv se hoti he
 Narrator Jim Hawkins is the young son of the owner of Admiral Benbow Inn
 ek purana sharaabi billy bons sarai kaa ek dirghakaalik basinda he, jisane sirf apane pravaas ke pehle hafte kaa hi bhugtan kiya he
 Jim soon learns that Bones is in secret and is particularly afraid to meet an unknown seafarer with one leg
 kuch maheene baad, blike dog naamak ek rahasyamay navik bons se milane aata he
 Their meeting turns violent, the Black Dog runs away, and Bones gets a tour
 jab gym uskaa khyaal rakhane lagata he, tab bons kabool karata he ki vah kabhi kukhyat samudri daaku captain flint kaa saathi tha or ab uske puraane saathi bons kaa samudri sandook chaahate hai
 After a while, another of Bones' companions arrives at the Pew Inn and pressures Jim to lead him to Bones
 puv bons ko ek kaagaj detaa he
 After Pew leaves, Bones opens the paper and sees a black spot, a pirate's summon, warning that he has until ten o'clock and died of epilepsy at the same place

 Under the leadership of Pew, the bandits received the chest and money, but were disappointed by the "no fist of the flint" in the box
 With the arrival of revenue agents, the pirates flee their ship, leaving only the blind pew, who accidentally falls under the agents' horses
 gym rahasyamay momjama packet lekar dow livse ke paas jaataa he, kyonki vah ek "sajjan or ek magistrate" he; or vah squaire trelavni or gym hockins milakar uski jaanch karte hai
 He finds a log-book relating to the treasures looted during Captain Flint's career, as well as a detailed map of an island, which marks the location of Flint's secret treasury
 squaire trelavni turant hi dow livse tathaa gym kii madad se khajaane ko khoj nikaalane ke liye ek jahaaj yatra kii yojana banaata he

 Silver helps Trelawny hire the rest of the crew
 jab gym bristol aata he or silver se milane spai glass sharabakhaane jaataa he, tab use turant hi shaq hota he: silver kii ek taang nahin he, jis tarah ke vyakti ke bare main bons ne saavdhaan kiya tha or blike dog sharabakhaane main baitha hota he
 Upon seeing Jim, the Black Dog runs away and so reliably refuses to know anything about the Silver Fugitive that he wins Jim's trust
 abhiyaan ke bare main captain smolat kii galatfahami or silver ke chune hue chaalak dal ke baavjood hispaniola carabian sagar kii yatra ke liye chal padataa he
 When they are nearing their destination, Jim slowly moves to the ship's apple barrel to pick up some apples
 jab vah andar hota he, tab vah silver ko chaalak dal ke kuch sadasyon se khusur-phusur karte sunata he
 Silver confesses that he was Captain Flint's logistics officer and that many of the crew members were once Flint's men; And he is recruiting more members to strengthen his side
 flint kaa khajaana baraamad hone ke baad, silver hispaniola ke adhikariyon kii hatya karne kaa iraadaa rakhata he or apane tathaa apane aadamiyon ke liye lut ke maal par kabja karnaa chahta he
 Jim warns Smollett and Livsey of imminent rebellion when the pirates go to their bedroom
 jab ve trager island pahunchate hai, silver ke adhikansh aadmi turant tat par chale jate hai
 Although Jim did not know by then, Silver's men blacken Jim by abandoning Silver's more careful plan to postpone any open rebellion or violence before embarking on the treasure ship, and demanded an immediate capture of the treasure
 We do
 gym silver ke aadamiyon ke saath jahaaj se utarataa he, lekin tat par aate-aate hi vah unase dur bhaag jaataa he
 Hiding in the forest, Jim sees Silver killing a loyal member of Smollett
 apni jaan bachaane ke liye bhaagate hue uskaa saamana flint ke ek anya purv saathi ben gun se hoti he, jo us dweep par pichley teen varshon se akelaa fansaa hua tha, lekin vah gym ke saath acchhee tarah pesh aata he, is aashaa ke saath ki use sabhy jivan main waapas lautne kaa ek mauqaa milegaa
 Meanwhile, Trelawny captured Livse and his men by surprise, capturing some of the remaining pirates in Hispaniola
 ve naav se kinare pahunche or dweep ke ek parityakt, kilaband baade main chale gayi, jahaan jald hi gym hockins bhi aa pahunchaa, jisane ben gun ko peeche kar rakhaa tha
 Silver tries to negotiate a settlement for Smollett's surrender through a flag of truce; Smollett responds in a blunt manner, then Silver fires up with anger and warns him to attack the fence
 usne hamalaa bolne se pehle dhamkee di, "unke liye maut bhaagyashaalee hogi"
 samudri daakuon ne baade par hamalaa bol diya, lekin ugr ladaai main donon ore ke nuksaan ke baad ve vahaan se chale gayi
 At night, Jim secretly came out of the enclosure, took Ben Gunn's manned boat and went to Hispaniola in the dark
 usne jahaaj ke lungar ke rasse ko kaat daalaa, use nirawalamb chhod diya or tat par ke daakuon kii pahunch se dur kar diya
 bhor ke samay, vah phir se jahaaz ke paas ja pahunchaa or us par chadhane main safal hua
 Of the two bandits on the ship, only one was still alive: Karnadhar, Israel Hands, who killed his partner in a drunken brawl, and was also badly injured in the mess
 hands ne ilaaj or brandi ke badale main jahaaj ko ek surakshit kinare lagane main madad dena sweekaar kiya, lekin jahaaj jaise hi kinare pahunchaa hands ne gym kii htya karne kii koshish kii
 jahaaj kii rassi par chadhakar gym bhaag niklaa or jab hands ne kataar phenkakar use bindhane kaa prayaas kiya, tab gym ne baadhya hokar hands ko goli maar di
 After safely putting Hispaniaola ashore, in the dark of night, Jim went backwards into the enclosure
 andhere kii vajah se, use bahut der tak pataa nahin chal paaya ki baade par ab daakuon kaa kabja ho chukaa he or vah aasaani se unki giraft main aa gaya
 The ever-weaker Silver's leadership became more vulnerable when his fellow hostages demanded to kill Jim or torture him for information
 jorge meri ke netritv main samudri daakuon ke dal ke silver ke pratidwandviyon ne silver ko phir se kaala dhabba diya or use captaini se hataane kii koshish kii
 silver ne unhen apni vakpatutaa se jawaab diya, kaala dhabba banane ke liye bible ke ek prishth ko vikrut karne ke liye unhen jhidki di or unhen bataaya ki dow livse se mila khajaane kaa nakshaa uske paas he, is prakaar usne dal kaa vishwaas phir se arjeet kar liya
 The next day, the pirates set out on a treasure hunt
 Ben Gunn pursues them, making a ghostly sound to stop them from moving forward, but Silver moves forward and discovers the place where Flint's treasure was buried
 samudri daakuon ko pataa chalata he ki bhandar lutaa ja chukaa he or sara khajaana ja chukaa he
 The enraged bandits turn to Silver and Jim, but Ben Gann, Dr
 Livesey, and Abraham Gray ambush them, surprising the two of them being killed and the others fleeing
 silver dow livse ke saamne aatmasamarpan karata he or apane kaam par lautne kaa vaada karata he
 They go to Ben Gunn's cave house, where Ganna hid the treasure for a few months
 khajaana gym or ben gann sahit trelavni or uske vafaadaar aadamiyon ke bich baanta jaataa he or ve england waapas chale jate hai, jivit bache daakuon ko us nirjan tapu main akelaa chhod diya jaataa he
 Silver runs away with the help of the terrifying Ben Gunn and a small portion of the treasure
 silver ko yaad karte hue gym kahata he ki "main kah saktaa hum ki vah apni puraani nigro se mila or shaayad abhi bhi uske or captain flint ke saath maje se rah rahaa hoga
 isaki hi aashaa he, mujhe lagata he, kisi or duniya main aaraam se uske jeene ke maukey bahut hi kam hai

 Major part of the prequel is pirate Captain J
 Flint relates, "the blood thirsty pirate who ever was", who never appeared, died before the main story began
 ek lambe karier ke saath flint walrus kaa captain tha, jo mukhya rup se west indies or dakshin america upniveshon ke taton main kaam kiya karata tha
 His crew members, who appear in the main story, also include the following characters: Flint's first partner, William Bones; His logistics officer John Silver; His gunner Israel Hands; And his other sailors include: George Merry, Tom Morgan, Pew, "black Dog" and Allerdas
 Many other members of Flint's crew were involved in the Hispanola sea voyage, but it was not always possible to identify who was Flint's man and who later agreed to join the rebellion - such as a ship's officer, Job Anderson, and Rebel "john", who died in search of treasured treasury
 flint or uskaa dal safal, krur, bhaybheet karanevaala tha or amir bhi, agar ve churaae gayi paise apane haathon main rakh sakate
 apni dakaiti ke jariye flint ne ek bada khajaana jamaa kar liya tha, jo sona, chaandi kii eenton or hathiyaaron ke bhandar ke rup main £7000,000 kaa tha - lekin yah khajaana doordaraj ke ek carabian dweep main gaad kar rakhaa gaya tha
 Flint, along with six of his sailors, had brought this treasure from the walrus to shore and had also built an enclosure for safety
 unhone jab ise gaad diya, tab flint akele hi walrus par waapas aayaa - usne anya sabhi chah logon kii hatya kar di
 khajaane ke sthaan kaa ek nakshaa usne marane tak apane paas hi rakhaa
 Flint and his team immediately went unnoticed thereafter, but they appeared in Savannah City, Georgia Province
 Flint was ill then, and his illness was not cured due to excessive intake of rum
 yaad kiya gaya ki rogashyya par rahete hue vah "fiftine main" naamak ek maanjhi samooh geet ga rahaa tha or lagaataar ram kii maang kiye ja rahaa tha, jabaki uskaa cheharaa nila padataa ja rahaa tha
 His last words were "darby Amgrave! Darby Amgrave!" And then, after a few abuses! "bring rum from the back of the ship, Darby!"
 Just before he died, he handed over the treasure map to his fellow Billy Bones of the Walrus
 flint kii mrityu ke baad dal vibhajit ho gaya, unamem se zyaadaatar log england laut gayi
 They used their share in outside treasures differently
 jon silver ne apana £2000 bainkon ke sef main rakh choda or england ke bristol main ek tateey sharabakhaane kaa rakshak ban gaya
 The pews spent £ 1200 a year and spent the latter two years begging and faking
 ben gann bina nakshaa ke khajaane kii khoj main trager island chalaa gaya or khoj ke prayaas turant vifal ho gayi, uske dal ke sadsy dweep main use akelaa chhodkar chale gayi
 As the map passed, Bones knew that he was a special person, so he tried to take refuge in a place far away from England
 yatra karte hue vah west country ke sagar tateey gaanv blike hill cove or 'admiral benbove' sarai ja pahunchaa
 The major duality in Treasure for Island is between the morality of advanced civilization versus the indiscipline of man in his wildness
 pramukh nayakon main gym hockins, dow livse or captain smolat nishtha, satyavadita, mitvyayita, anushaasan, dharmik vishwaas or sanyam jaise gun ke saath khadey dikhte hai
 Pirates suffer from drunkenness, profanity, and mutual betrayal and suffer from a tendency to attain instant fulfillment by describing life as short and uncertain
 long jon silver is dwandv main madhyamargi he: usamen nayakon ke sanyam, mitvyayita or vilambit tripti ke gun maujuud hai, lekin yah sab mahaj apane lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye he, us lakshya prapti ke liye vah jhooth bhi bolta he, gaddari karata he or hatya tak kar daalata he
 Most bandits cannot achieve the level of Long John, which gives him a natural advantage in his team
 upanyaas ko bildungsroman ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jo vikaas or iske kathavachak gym hockins kii badhati umr ke saath sambandh rakhata he
 Jim's moral development reaches a climax when he promises not to run away from Silver and then meets Dr
 Livesey near the fence
 gym ko dar tha ki yatnaa dene par vah hispaniola kaa pataa bataa de saktaa he, isliye vah livse ko jahaaj ke bare main bataa detaa he taaki daakuon ke us tak pahunchane se pehle doctor use vahaan se anyatra le ja saken
 ek noujvaan par yatnaa kii sambhaavna dekhte hue livse gym ko apane saath bhaagane ke liye kahata he
 Jim refuses, saying "I have given tongue", this is a hero's policy of truthfulness despite personal risks
 gym kii naitikta ko apane upar lete hue livse kahata he: "main ise apane kandhe par liye letaa hum, ek hi saans main, saare dosha or shame liye letaa hum, mere bachche
 "jim also denies this dependency, like an independent adult like Livsey and his teammates
 He says:" No, my answer is, you are well aware that you don't do it yourself- nor Square or Captain would do it and i will not do it too
 " anya kai nayak bhi ullekhneey rup se apane jabaan ke pakke rahe, vishesh rup se dow livse jo apni hippocratic shapath ke prati bhi vafaadaar the, bimaaron kii madad karne ke apane vaade ko unhone bakhubi nibhaayaa, yahaan tak ki billy bons or baade par kabja karne vaale daakuon kii bhi upeksha nahin kii
 Long John Silver diverges from heroes mainly because of lack of loyalty and truth, otherwise he has many values like them
 silver na sirf ek purana jhootha he, balki vah badi safai tathaa vishwaneey dhang se jhooth bolta he
 He claims not to know the Black Dog with such credibility that Jim Hawkins assumes that "I will bail Long John Silver's innocence
" His stories told to his rebellious comrades about his career under Captain England and Flint are also partly fictitious
 When Jim Hawkins captures him, Silver readily agrees to abandon his crew and work under Captain Billy, in return he seeks Jim's help to spare his life
 uske baad, jab use yakeen ho jaataa he ki flint kaa khajaana uski pahunch main he, tab silver apane vaade se mukar jane, gym ko maar daalane or khud ke liye hispaniola par kabja karne kii yojana banaata he
 Finally, when he realizes that the treasure has disappeared, he changes sides again and betrays his crew
 silver apni antim chaal main asharfi ke thile ke saath kaid se bhaagta he or gaayab ho jaataa he
 a strong comparison is made between the alcoholism of the bandits and the restraint of the heroes, especially Dr
 Livesey
 trager island main sharaab anek khalnaayakon kaa naash kar detii he
 Captain Flint dies of excessive rum drinking
 dow livse ne pehle aghat ke baad billy bons ko sharaab pine se manaa kiya tha; lekin bons is chetavanee par dhyaan nahin detaa he or phir se biimaar padakar mar jaataa he
 Alcoholism leads to a fatal fight between Israel Hands and o'brien, helping Jim Hawkins to recapture Hispanola
 yah dridhtaa se antarnihit he ki dweep par samudri daakuon kii nashe kii haalat se satarkta main kami aati he, jisase ben gann neend main pade unamem se kuch ko maar daalane main sakasham hota he
 Silver himself gave a very stern warning to Israel Hands about the consequences of drinking too much alcohol: "but you can never be happy while drunk
 Come to me, in terms of sailing with others like you My heart stops! 


 Tomorrow you fill your stomach with rum and go hang somewhere
 " hispaniola par gym hockins or israel hands ke bich mukhyatah dharmanishthata banaam adharm ke sangharsh ko viksit kiya gaya he
 Hands pretends to have a life-threatening illness and Jim tells him that if he is near death he should pray like a Christian
 jab hands use poochta he kyon, tab gym uttejit hokar jawaab detaa he, "bhagwaan kii dayaa ke liye, mi
 hands, isiilie
" hands asaamaanya lambaai main jawaab detaa he, "maine ab tak kabhi bhi bhagwaan kii ore se achchhai aate nahin dekhi he
 The first thing that comes up about him is my imagination; Dead persons do not bite; My thoughts about him are - Amen, that's it
 " iske alaava, maranoparant jivan ke bare main hands ke avishvaas se gym ke vishwaas main antar tha
 Talking about o'brien the robber and rebel Hands had killed, Jim said, "you can kill someone's body, Mr
 Hands, but not the soul; you should know

" Silver's place in religious conflict is unclear
 ek bible ko vikrut karne par vah apane saathiyon ko bhayaavah nateezon kii chetavanee detaa hua kahata he ki jis dick ne bible ko vikrut kiya he use jivan bhar buree kismat sataati rahegi
 haalanki, usne yah baat is sandarbh main kahi thi ki uske aadmi use captain ke pad se hataa rahe the or uski dharmik dhamkee apane virodhiyon ko daraane ke liye shaayad ek chalbaaji ho
 Apart from the biblical incident, Silver did not show any clear inclination towards religion
 Many of Silver's men took the stigma of distorting the Bible very seriously, indicating that they had religious feelings and their own fears
 lekin silver or uske aadamiyon ke liye, bible ko shaareerik kshati pahunchaana bible ke upadeshon kaa ulanghan karne ke vichaar se kahin adhik bhayaavah he, isse dharm ke prati unke drushtikon kaa aadhyatmik kii tulana main kahin adhik saanskarik hone kaa pataa chalata he
 The struggle of frugality versus extravagance goes on for the majority of the book
 zyaadaatar samudri daaku apane paise sambhaal paane main aksham hai; silver ne puv se ise jodate hue bataaya "usne baarah sau pound ek saal main kharch kar diya, maano sansad kaa lord ho
 vah ab kahaan he? khayr, vah ab mar chukaa he or kabr main he, lekin usase do saal pehle, satyanaash ho! vah aadmi bhookha mar rahaa tha

 There are many islands that can be a real-life inspiration for Treasure Island
 british virgin island main sthit norman island kii yatra ke dauraan ek navik chachaa ne yuva stivension ko ek kahani sunai thi, is tarah norman island kitaab ke liye aprayatksh prerana ho saktaa he
 Around Norman Island on Virgin Island is Dead Men's Chest Island, which Stevenson found in a book by Charles Kingsley
 stivension ne kaha ki "trager island kingsle ke at list: e christmas in da west indies se nikal kar aayaa tha; jahaan mujhe 'ded mans chest' mila - vahi beej tha"
 scaleton island ke liye agar yah "beej" tha to upanyaas main saamaanya rup se yaa har tarah se "ded mans chest" vaakyansh kaa arth aspasht rah jaataa he
 Other contenders are the small islands at Queen Street Gardens in Edinburgh, as "robert Louis Stevenson lived in Harriet Row and it is understood that the window of his shanayaksa at Queen Street Gardens may have shown us the sea floor, on Treasure Island

 georgia, savannah main samudri daaku kaa ghar he, kehete hai captain flint ke antim kuch din yaheen beete the, or unka bhoot yahaan sampatti talashta he
 Stevenson also published The Silverado Squatter in 1883, the story of his honeymoon trip to Napa Valley, California in 1880
 silverado main unke anubhav silverado scaches naamak patrika main rakhe gaye hai or napa vaili main unke aasapaas ke drishy par unki bahut sari tippaniyan hai jo trager island ko bahut saare vivarnaatmak varnan pradaan karata he
 In May 1888, Stevenson spent about a month near the Manasquan River in Brille, New Jersey
 There is a small wooded island on the river, then it was commonly known as "osborne Island"
 ek din stivension ne dweep kaa daura kiya or isse bahut hi prabhavit hokar unhone apratyaashit rup se iskaa namakaran trager island kiya or unke upanyaas kii neenv aakaar lene lagi

 The name of the island is now officially Nienstadt Island in honor of the family who donated it to the Boro
 dweep kaa nakshaa shethland main anst ke dweep se kaaphi halakaa-sa miltaa-julata he
 The Unst Island website claims that Stevenson wrote Treasure Island after Unst's visit
 jaanboojhkar upanyaas ke sateek taarikh ko stivension aspasht chhod dete hai, hockins likhte he ki "17-- ke kisi ek varsh main" vah apni kalam uthaata he
 Although some of the action can be combined with dates, it is still unclear whether Stevenson had a precise chronology in mind
 pehali taarikh 1745 kii he, jaisaa ki donon - phontanoy main dow livse ke kaam or billy bons ke lakdi ke kunde main ubhari taarikh se - sthapit hota he
 Admiral Hawke is a very familiar name when Hawke earns the name in the Battle of Cap Finistere, meaning no later date than 1747 and promoted to the rank of Admiral, but all of this would have happened before Hawke's death in 1781 is
 ek anya sanket he, haalanki aspasht he; vah adhyay VII main bristol se squaire trelavniers dwaara die gaye patr kii taarikh he, jahaan vah mul sthaneey nivaasiyon, jaldasyuon yaa ghrunit francisi se nipatane ke liye paryaapt taadaad main navikon ko praapt karne kii apni kaamana kaa sanket detaa he
 This expression shows that Great Britain was at war with France at that time; For example, during the Battle of the Austrian Succession from 1740 to 1748 or the Seven Years War from 1756 to 1763

 in do tarikhon main pehali ke flint ke dweep main khajaana chhod jane kii taarikh hone kii sambhaavna he; duusari taarikh fnint ke maut se pehle kii
 As it has been reliably stated that Flint died at least three years before the novel's event, it could not have happened before 1757 and is still in line with the map today
 isiilie aisa prathit hota he ki trager island kii ghatnaayen 1757 se pehle kii nahin hai kahani ke ant main spanish america ke ek bandargah main jaise hi ek british yudhpot mil jaataa he, usee samay skinar hispaniola shanti se vahaan lungar daal detaa he, yah nishchit taur par 1762 se pehle hua hoga, jab great britain ke khilaaf spain seven ears waar main shaamil hua
 Hence the above evidence gives the date 1757 and 1762
 haalanki tarikhon kaa yah anukram, dick ko die long jon silver ke khud ke vrutant kaa khandan karata he, jise gym hockins ne tab suna jab vah apple bairel main tha
 It has been claimed that Silver is fifty years old, it would mean he would not be born before 1707; And both Silver and Israel Hands, together with Flint's crew, are said to have been in about 1727, thirty years before they arrived on Treasure Island; Was a marine experience
 haalanki, silver kaa daawa he ki vah pehle "england ke saath or phir flint ke saath" jalayatra par niklaa tha, 1720 main captain edward england kii mrityu kii taarikh se pehle kisi bhi samay main, isane use apane karier kii shuruuaat ke liye majaboor kiya, jiskaa arth he samudr main tees saal bahut lanbaa karier he
 Silver also states that the surgeon, who had amputated his leg, was hanged at Corso Cassell with Roberts' entourage: implying that he must have been disabled since at least 1722, his age then 15 Will not be more than one year old, is eligible for an important position like a logistics officer under Captain Flint, or is not even eligible to be a team member under England who was very senior and for a long time Worked so as to "keep nine hundred safe"
 jaisaa ki asli itihaas main iskaa ullekh he, kuch logon or ghatnaon ke bare main silver kaa daawa he ki usee samay africa ke virdohi paksh iske gavaah rahe the or silver ke kaaryon ke naam or jagah ekadam puri tarah se sateek nahin hai
 Silver's stories and inconsistencies may not be too convincing when compared to his claims of his feet being injured while working for Admiral Hawke, a listener very ignorant of which to pay attention
 silver jarur pachaas ke bajaae saath ke kahin adhik kareeb hoga, yaa phir england or roberts jaise samudri daaku kii uski kahaniyaan managasaint, suni-sunai hai, jise usne duusare kinhin samudri daakuon se suna tha or usamen usne khud ko bhi shaamil kar liya - yahi uski visangatiyon kaa kaaran hoga

 Australia is theoretically a monarchy, and the ruler of Australia is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all the constitutional powers of the governor, as his representative, the governor-general of Australia
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen " australia kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko " australia ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical background of the monarchy in Australia dates back to British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and established colonies in various corners of the world

 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail

 Peter Drucker has a view in this regard that whatever the manager does, it is by decisions
 ham jaanate hai ki prashaskon ko din–pratidin anek kaary karne padate hai or in kaaryon ko karne ke liye unke paas anek vikalp hote hai, in vikalpon main se sarvonttam vikalp koun sa he, iskaa nirdhaaran karnaa 'nirnay' lenaa he
 Terry has said in this regard that 'life is the decision-making of administrators
 terry ke shabdon main yadi prashaasak kii koi saarvbhaumik pahchaan he, to vah he uskaa nirnay lenaa
 Administrators have to take their decision management tasks only under planned organization, direction, control, etc
 duusare shabdon main, ham kah sakate hai ki nirnayan prabandh prakriya main sarvavyaapak he
 Simon's view that decision-making is administration, seems to be quite appropriate
 simon ke shabdon main ham sahamat ho yaa na ho parantu yah nirvivaad satya he ki nirnay hi prashasan kaa hriday he
 Decisions in administration are the result of certain processes
 nirnay prakriya kii teen visheshtaayen hoti hai – Since decision making is a process and takes place at a time, the surroundings and the events that occur simultaneously will affect the outcome
 nirnayan kaa shabdic arth antim parinaam tak pahunchne se lagaaya jaataa he, jabaki vyaavhaarik drushtikon se iskaa aashay nishkarsh par pahunchne se he

 George r
 In Terry's words, a decision is a choice of two or more possible alternatives based on a single criterion
 mekafarland ke anusaar, nirnay lenaa chayan kii ek kriya he, jiske antargat koi adhishashi di hui paristhitiyon main is nirnay par pahunchataa he ki kya kiya janaa chahie
 a decision represents a behavior that is selected from several possible choices

 shekel ke anusaar, nirnay lenaa rachanaatmak maansik kriya kaa vah kendra bindu he, jahaan kaary purti ke liye gyaan, vichaar, bhaavana tathaa kalpana kaa sanyog hota he
 According to Ernest Dale, administrative decisions mean decisions that are always taken in the course of correct administrative actions, such as - planning, organization, recruitment, direction, control, innovation and representation of employees
 lundvarg ke shabdon main, prashaskeey nirnay ek prakriya he jisamen ki ek vyakti sanghathan main duusare vyaktiyon ke vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne ke liye ek nirnay karata he, taaki ve vyakti sanghathan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne main apana yogadan de sake
 Thus it is clear that decision-making refers to selecting the best option from the available options to achieve the stated goal
 ek vishesh paristhiti main kaary kiya jaave, iskaa nirdhaaran nirnay lene waalon ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The administrator has more than one option when making decisions
 nirnay karnaa anek uplabdh vikalpon main se jaagruk chayan karnaa he
 Decisions are often expressed in the form of policy, rule, order or instruction
 at: saamanyat: nirnay kaaphi jatil or kathin hote hai, balki kai nirnay aise bhi hote hai, jinamein vichaar vimarsh karnaa adhik jaruri hota he
 In short, it can be said that out of the many options available under the most complex and intertwined circumstances, choosing the best option and giving it the form of work in an effective manner is called 'decision'
 
 upurkt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par nirnayan ke nimnaankit lakshan kehete ja sakate hai – Herbert Simon has described three levels of decision-making - peter epa
 drukar ne nirnay prakriya ke nimna charan batalaaye hai – Newman, Summer, and Warren have described the following four stages of the decision process - baike ne nirnay prakriya ke nimna 11 charan batalaaye hai – After studying the appropriate stages of the decision process, it can be said that a decision process may consist of the following steps - nirnay prakriya ke pratham str main kisi ek samasya ko vyavasthit dhang se su lajhane ke liye uske uddeshyon ko jaananaa va samajhnaa bahu t aavashyak he
 These objectives should be such that individual and institutional objectives can be coordinated

 barnard is sambandh main yah kehete hai ki samasya kii vyakhya karne se purv uske kisi samalochak tatv ko gyaat kar lenaa chahie kyonki samalochak tatv hi nirnayan kaa kendra bindu hota he
 This is the point where the election is made
 he ns tathaa mesi ke anusaar, samasya kii vyakhya main samalochak tatv pramu kha hota he
 Many officials even say that it is more difficult to explain the problem than its solution
 at: samasya kii vyakhyasaavdhaneepurvak kii jaani chahie
 After clear explanation and definition of the problem, the next step of the decision making process is to analyze the problem
 yadi samasya badi he to usko kai bhaagon main vibhakt kar liya jaataa he tathaa uske prayek bhaag kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 The relevant facts should be collected for analysis
 samasya kii spasht vyakhya tathaa vishleshan karne ke baad nirnayakarta vibhinn soochnaaon tathaa tathyon ke aadhaar par vibhinn vaikalpik samaadhaanon kaa vikaas karata he
 Developing alternative solutions is an important stage of the decision making process
 at: prashaskon main yah yogyata honi chahie ki ve vaikalpik samaadhaanon kaa vikaas kar saken
 After developing various alternative solutions, evaluating these options with a view to deciding them is the next stage of the decision making process
 in vikalpon kaa moolyankan nimna baton ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya janaa chahie– After evaluating the various options, the next stage of the decision making process is to choose the best option from one of those options
 prashaskon ke anubhav, anusandhan evam vishle shan ityadi vikalpon ke chunaav ke aadhaar ho sakate hai
 The administrator is influenced by many things before making the final decision
 isamen uskaa anubhav mahatvapurn he
 The administrative experience of administrators plays an important role in taking decisions
 lekin anubhav ke aadhaar par hi sadai va nirnay nahin liye ja sakate
 For this, administrators should examine the reality of the effects of decisions by organizations and the perceived circumstances
 chayan kii anusandhan tathaa vishle shan vidhiyaan bhi bahut adhik pra bhaavshaalee vidhiyaan maani jaati hai
 When a decision is taken to solve a problem, the next step is to give it a function
 prashaasak ko is prakaar ke prayaas karne chahie ki chuni hui kaarividhi sucharu rup se lagu kii ja sake
 The consent of the people to whom the decision is being implemented should also be taken in relation to that decision
 jab kisi nirnay ko kaaryrup pradaan kiya jaataa he, to prashaasak ko chahie ki vah us nirnay ke prabhaavon kaa mu lyankan kare tathaa unke sambandh main sabhi aavashyak soochnaaon ko ekatrit karen
 At the same time, the administrator should also establish control over the actions that are being taken to make the decision functional
 nirnay prakriya ke uparokt sabhi str par ek adarsh nirnay prakriya ke str kahe ja sakate hai, uparokt str hamako is baat se avgat karaate hai ki nirnay le ne ke liye kya–kya kriyaayein kii ja sakati hai
 These levels can also be reduced or increased according to the nature of the decision

 SOA is an attempt to provide a set of principles or AC controller concepts that are used during the stages of system development and integration
 sarvice orientation ke liye oparating system main sevaaon ke deele sangyojan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or anya takneekon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo anuprayogon ke antargat aati hai
 SOA separates functions into differentiated units, or services, which the developer makes available in a network, so that the user can combine and reuse them in the production of applications
 These services communicate with each other by passing data from one service to another or coordinating an activity between two or more services
 SOA kii pariklpana satatya ke ek prakaar ke rup main kii ja sakati he, jo kii vitarit computing yaa modular programing ke vipareet he
 The implementation of SOA depends on the network of software services

 Programmers have made extensive use of XML in SOA to structure the data that they hold almost in a detailed description-container
 isi ke anuroop, web servicij discripshan lenguage praroopik rup se khud sevaaon kaa varnan karti he, jabaki SOAP protocol sancharan protocol kaa varnan karata he
 Whether these description languages are the best choice for jobs and whether they will / will remain a favorite in the future remains a public discussion
 2008 ke anusaar SOA un data or sevaaon par nirbhar karata he jiskaa vivaran metadata ke dwaara kiya jaataa he, jise nimna do mandandon par khara utarana chahie: It is the purpose of SOA - to enable competitors to chain large volumes of functionality together to create ad hoc applications built almost entirely from existing software services
 ye hisse jitne bade hote hai, kisi kriyasheeltaa ke set ko karyanvit karne ke aavashyak interphes bindu utane hi kam hote hai; haalanki, kriyasheeltaa ke bahut bade hisse, aasaan punarupyog ke liye paryaapt daanedaar sabit nahin bhi ho sakate

 The development possibilities of SOA suggest that the marginal cost of building an n-th application is low, since all the software required to satisfy the need of other applications already exists
 adarsh rup main, ek nae anuprayog ke nirmaan ke liye ab keval orkestesan kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 To operate it, there should be no interaction between the parts or between the specified parts
 Instead, humans designate the interaction of services, being driven by newly unforeseen needs in a relative ad hoc manner

 SOA as an architecture relies on service orientation as its core design element
 yadi sarvice ek saadhaaran interphes pesh kare jo isamen anternihit jatilta ko alag rakhata ho, to upyogkarta seva ke platform karyanvayan ke gyaan ke bina swatantra sevaaon kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 SOA relies on services that demonstrate their functionality through an interface that other applications and services can read and understand how to use

 To make efficient use of an SOA, it is necessary to meet the following requirements: nimnlikhit maardarshak siddhant SOA ke vikaas, rakrakhaav or upyog ke liye buniyadi niyamon ko paribhaashit karte hai
 In terms of design and service definition, the following specific architecture principles focus on specific styles that affect the internal behavior of a system and the style of its design: nimnlikhit sandarbh ek SOA karyanvayan ko paribhaashit karne ke liye atirikt vichaar uplabdh karaate hai: Additionally, the following factors / parameters may be considered when defining an SOA implementation
 web sevaayen ek sarvice-oriented architekchar ko lagu kar sakati hai
 Web services form functional block-blocks, which are accessible on standard Internet protocols independent of programming languages and platforms
 ye sevaayen yaa to nae anuprayogon ko abhivyakt kar sakati hai, yaa keval maujuuda system ke aavaran detii he, jisase ve network-sakasham ho jate hai
 Each SOA building block can play one or both roles
 imlementres saamanyatya un web seva maanakon kaa upyog karte hue soas kaa nirmaan karte hai jisane udyog kshetra main vistrut sweekruti praapt kar lee he
 These standards also provide greater interaction and some protection from the login for proprietary vendor software
 haalanki, jini, CORBA yaa REST jaisi kisi bhi seva-aadhaarit takanic kaa upyog karte hue SOA kaa karyanvayan kiya ja saktaa he
 Architectures can operate independently of specific technologies
 diziner takneekon kii vyapak range kaa upyog karte hue SOA kaa karyanvayan kar sakate hai, inamen shaamil hai: Implementations may use one or more of these protocols, for example, they may use a file-system mechanism for the communication of data to conform to the prescribed interface-specification between processes conforming to the SOA concept

 SOA un anuprayogon ke vikaas ko sakasham banaata he jinhen deele sangyojan or antahkriya sevaaon ke sangyojan se banaaya gaya he
 These services interact based on a formal definition that is independent of the underlying platform and programming language
 interfes paribhaasha bhashaa-vishisht seva ke karyanvayan ko chhupaati he
 soa-based systems operate independently of development techniques and platforms
 
NET platform par chalane vaali c # java main likhi gayi sevaayen or java EE platform par chalane vaali sevaayen, udhaaharan ke liye, donon kaa upbhog ek saamaanya mishrit anuprayog ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Applications running on either of the two platforms can also consume services running on other web services that promote reuse
 prabandhit parivesh bhi COBOL ligasi system ko aawarit kar saktaa he or unhen software sevaaon ke rup main pesh karata he
 This has infinitely increased the useful life of many major systems, regardless of the language they originally used

 Higher-level languages such as BPEL and specifications such as WS-CDL and ws-extend the concept of syncing services, for which they provide definition methods and support orchestration of microfinance services to more macro granular services, Which the architect can put into the work flow and business processes are implemented in composite applications or portals
 2008 ke anusaar shodhakartaaon ne SOA ke karyanvayan ke liye seva avyav architekchar ke upyog kii jaanch shuru kii he
 Service Oriented Modeling is a SOA framework that identifies different disciplines, guiding the SOA practitioner to conceptualize, analyze, design and architect their service oriented assets
 sarvice oriented modelling fremawork bhinn avyavon kaa varnan karne vaale "naqshe" yaa ek kaary saranchana ko prastut karata he, jo ek safal sarvice oriented modling drushtikon main yogadan dete hai
 It represents the key elements that identify the "what to do" aspect of the service development plan

 SOMF also provides a common modeling notation for alignment between business and IT organizations
 SOMF ko nimnlikhit siddhanton ke puraa karne ke liye dizin kiya gaya he: Commentators have provided several definitions of SOA
 oysis samooh or open samooh donon ne aupchaarik paribhaashaon kaa nirmaan kiya he
 Oasis defines SOA as follows: bhinn swaamitv rakhanevaale domens ke niyantran main ho asi vitarit kshamtaaon ke upyog or sanghathan ke liye ek pratimaan
 yah prastaav rakhane, khoj karne or parsparik kriya ke liye samroop saadhan uplabdh karaata he or maapan yogya purvasthitiyon or apekshaaon ke saath susangat vaanchit prabhaav utpann karne ke liye kshamtaaon kaa upyog karata he
 The service contract requires the following components: 2008 ke anusaar network prabandhan ke kshetra main SOA ke siddhanton ko lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 Examples of service-oriented network management architectures include TS 188 001 NGN management OSS architecture from ETSI and M
3060 next-generation network management principles from ITU-T
 SOA ke buniyadi dhaanche ke prabandhan ke upkarnon main shaamil hai: Some enterprise architects believe that SOA can help businesses respond quickly and cost-effectively to changing market conditions
 architekchar kii yah style micro str ke bajaay macro str par punarupyog ko badhaava detii he
 In some contexts, SOA can be considered a gradual development of architecture rather than a revolution
 yah purv software architekchar kii kai sarvottam prathaon ko apane main banaae rakhata he
 For example, in communications systems, there has been little development in the field of solutions that use truly static bindings to talk to other devices
 aupchaarik rup se ek SOA drushtikon ko apnaane par, aise system bhalee prakaar se paribhaashit, bahut adhik antahkriyaatmak interphes ke mahatva par dabaav daalane ke liye apane aap ko taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Some had questioned whether SOA merely revived concepts such as modular programming, event-oriented design or interface / component based design
 SOA seva ke karyanvayan se upyogkartaaon ko alag karne ke uddeshy ko badhaava detaa he
 Therefore services can be run on different distributed platforms and may be available on the network
 is se sevaaon kaa punarupyog bhi adhiktam ho saktaa he
 SOA is an architectural and design discipline designed to achieve the goal of enhancing interactivity / interoperability, expanding federation, and business and technology domain alignment
 sarvice oriented architekchar, jatil software-pradhan system ke nirmaan ke liye ek architektural drushtikon he, jo saarvatrik rup se ek dusre se judy hui or anyonyashrith building blox ke samooh yani sevaaon se banataa hai
 SOA realizes its business and IT benefits through the use of analytics and design methods when creating services
 yah vidhi sunishchit karti he ki sevaayen architektural drushti or yojana ke saath susangat rahen or wein sevabhimukh ke siddhanton kaa paalan karti rahen
 SOA se vyapaar or prabandhan pahaluon kaa samarthan karne vaale tark kai prakashnon main die gaye hai
 The only unit of functionality available to the service is through formally defined interfaces
 sevaayen ek tarah kii "naino udhyamon " ho sakati hai jinka nirmaan or sudhaar aasaan hota he
 And services can also be "large corporations", which form the coordinated function of secondary services
 sevaayen aamtaur par sarvice orientation ke nimna siddhanton kaa paalan karti hai: The mature rollout of SOA effectively defines the organization's API
 sevaaon ke karyanvayan ko badi pariyojnaon se alag pariyojnaon ke rup main dekhne ke kaarnon main shaamil hai: Indirect benefits from SOA include dramatically simplified testing
 The services are autonomous, phaseless, have fully documented interfaces and differ from the cross cutting concerns of the implementation
 udyog pehle kabhi bhi aisi paristhitiyon se nahin gujara he
 If the organization has appropriate defined test data, then when a service is being built, an associated stub is created, which responds to the test data
 pratigaman pareekshan, lipiyon, data or pratibhaav ke ek puure set ko bhi seva ke liye kaam main liya jaataa he
 The services sought may also be tested as a 'black box' using the present stub
 jahaan aadya or daayre se baahar kii sevaayen stub hai, jabaki jaal kaa shesh bhaag puri seva ke pareekshan niojak he, ese pareekshan vaataavaran kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 Since each interface consists of a complete set of documents, which is a complete set of regression test documentation, identifying problems in test services becomes straightforward
 pareekshan seva apane dastavejikaran ke anusaar kaam karti he esa maanya karne ke liye or vaataavaran main maujuuda sabhi sevaaon ke pareekshan maamle or dastavejikaran ke bich rikt sthaan dhundne ke liye hi pareekshan viksit kiya jaataa he
 The only complication is managing the data state of idempotent services
 seva ke dastavejikaran main jahaan vah upyogi ho us str par udhaaharan sahaayarup siddh hote he
 Documentation of some apis in the Java community process provides good examples
 kyonki ye vistrut hote hai, staff praroopik rup se keval mahatvapurn up-set kaa upyog karenge
 JSR-89 ke bheetar 'ossjsa

 a clear and common challenge was that of managing service metadata
 soa-based environments may include many services that exchange messages to perform tasks
 dizin ke anusaar, ekmaatr anuprayog kai million sandeshon ko utpann kar saktaa he
 Providing information on how services interact and managing them can be complex
 ek duusari chunauti he, SOA sthaan main pareekshan kii kami 
 aise koi atyaadhunik upkaran nahin hai jo ek vishisht architekchar main sabhi netritvheen sevaaon kii pareekshan kshamta uplabdh karaayen
 samastareey vishwaas kii kami ke kaaran yah jaruri he ki nirmaataa or upabhokta donon sevaaon kaa nirantar pareekshan karte rahen
 SOA kaa mukhya uddeshy vyapaar ko chusti / tezi pradaan karnaa he
 Therefore it is important to invest in a testing framework, which will provide transparency to find the culprit in the architecture
 Business growth requires SOA services to be governed by business objectives and guidelines as defined in the Business Motivation Model
 anya ek or chunauti suraksha ke upyukt str uplabdh karaane se sambandhit he
 When an application that other applications can use also exposes its capabilities as AC services, then the security models contained within the application are not sufficient
 That is, application-managed security is not the right model for security of services
 kai nai praudyogikiyon or maanakon ne SOA main suraksha ke liye adhik upyukt model uplabdh karaane shuru kiye hai
 See SOA Security Entry for more information

 soya iti laagat main kami kii koi guarantee nahin detaa he, naa hi bazaar main teji laane kii yaa pranaliyon main chusti laane kii koi guarantee detaa he
 Successful SOA implementations can be all or some of these benefits, depending on the quality and relevance of the system architecture and design
 aantarik iti delivery sanghathan niyamit SOA prayaason kaa aarambh karte hai or inamen se kuch vyapaar main avadharanaon ko anupyukt tareeke se pesh karte hai, jisase uske bare main galatarahami bani rahati he

 The business leadership also agreed that this organization is implementing SOA properly
 SOA kaa sabase mahatvapurn laabh yah he ki ise aasaani se punahupyog main liya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, ultimately, accountability and finance models should be developed in the organization itself
 a business unit should be encouraged to create services that other units can use
 Conversely, units should be encouraged to reuse services
 This requires some new components of administration: SOA kii kuch aalochanaayen web sevaaon ke saath SOA ke sankalan par nirbhar hai
 For example, some critics claim that SOA results in an increase of layers of XML, which explains XML parsing and structure
 duurastha prakriya kol ke mul yaa dwiadhari roopon ke abhaav main, anuprayog kii gati dhimi pads sakati hai or unhen adhik processing kshamta kii zarurat padati he, jo laagat main badhotari kaa kaaran banataa he
 Most implementations include these overheads, but SOA can also be implemented using AC technologies that do not rely on remote process calls or translation via XML)
 ubhartee hui khule strot XML parsing praudyogikiyon or bhinn xml-sangat dwiadhari swaroopon se utpann hota he jo SOA ke achche pradarshan ke liye vaada karte hai
 Infrastructure services require both the consumer and the provider to share the same consumer-specific context, which is either included or referenced by a message exchange between the consumer and the provider
 is baadha kii kami yah he ki yadi seva pradaata ko prayek upabhokta ke liye saajha sandarbh ko banaaye rakhane kii aavashyaktaa ho, to isse seva pradaata kii samgr maapan kshamta kam ho sakati he
 This increases the connection between the service provider and the consumer and makes it more difficult to change service providers
 Finally, some critics believe that SOA services are still severely hampered by the applications they express
 ek or mudda WS-* maanakon or utpaadon ke kramik vikaas se sambandhit he or jab tak SOA ko atirikt bajet or atirikt saboot-kii-avadharana ke liye aakasmik kaary ke saath purna rup se prabandhit or anumaanit na kiya jaye, tab tak SOA is prakaar se nae jokhimon ko shaamil karata he
 Some critics regard SOA as merely a natural development of already well-built architectures
 iti system dizin kabhi kabhi roopantarit system kii vaanchhneeyata ko andekha karte hai
 SOA based systems, hard code operations, multiple systems with the organization's goods and services, thus constraining their online services and merchant agility in the global market
 dizin prakriya main aglaa kadam seva vitaran manch or uske karyanvayan kii paribhaasha ko samavisht karata hai
 In the SDP design phase, the business information model, identity management, products, materials, tools and end-user service attributes, as well as whether the system is so agile as to keep pace with the gradual development of the business and its customers - these issues are defined is
 web 2

 In an "internet of Services", all people, machines and goods, will be accessible through the network structure of tomorrow
 In this way the Internet will offer services for all walks of life and business, such as virtual insurance, online banking and music and more
 These services will require a complex service architecture, including a service delivery platform that brings demand and supply together

 SOA karyanvayan ko digital tantrika tantra yaa jiro latency enterprize ke rup main gyaat vishaal drushtikon ke pratinidhitiv ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Template: Software Engineering mahadwipiya vyavastha yaa mahadwipiya naakaabandi nepolian yudhon ke samay great britain viruddh sangharsh main nepolian pratham kii videsh niti thi
 The French government blocked the French Coast on 16 May 1806
 usee ke jawaab main nepolian ne 21 navambar 1806 ko 'berlin decri' kaa elaan kiya jiske dwaara britain ke viruddh bade paimaane par vyapaar-pratibandh laga diye gayi
 This ban was only effective about half the time
 iskaa ant 11 april 1814 ko hua jab nepolian ne pehali baar padatyag kiya
 There was no significant economic loss to Britain from this ban
 jab nepolian ko pataa chalaa ki adhikansh vyapaar spain or rus ke raste ho rahaa he, to usne un donon deshon par akraman kar diya
 Britain was the biggest obstacle to the imperialist expansion of Nepal, and Britain was the only power in Europe that Napoleon could not defeat because Britain's naval power was superior to France
 atah nepolian ne england ko parrast karne ke liye use aarthik drushti se pangu bana dene kii niti apanaai
 In fact, he resorted to economic war against England and in this order he adopted the continental system
 nepolian acchhee tarah jaanata tha ki sainya drushti se england ko parajeet karnaa sambhav nahin kyonki england kii apni shakti to uske unnat udyogon main nihit thi
 If the European market for goods produced from these industries is blocked, then these industries will automatically stop and there will be problem of unemployment
 uskaa maananaa tha ki vyapaar par nirbhar england kii aarthik nakebandi karne se vastuon kii keemten girengi or england kii arthvyavastha dhwast hone lagegi
 On the other hand, by closing the continent to England, England will be able to buy food items from France and will be able to take precious metals from it
 isse england kii aarthik sthit kharaab ho jaaegi or france us par vijay praapt kar sakegaa
 With this idea, the Nepalese attempted to implement the continental system by the 'berlin Order', 'milan Order', 'fatballon Order'
 in adeshon ke jariye usne apane adhinsth rajyon ko england se vyapaar karne kii manaahi kar di or yah bhi spasht kar diya ki jo rajya yaa raja is aadesh kaa ulanghan kar england ke saath pratyaksh yaa paroksh vyapaar karenge unke khilaaf yudhjanit kaarywahi kii jaaegi
 England broke the trade relations with France by passing the Orders in Council to counter the continental system of the Nepalese and asked the neutral countries to do the same
 mahadwipiya vyavastha apane uddeshy ko praapt karne main asafal rahi
 Its purpose was to destroy British trade which could not be fulfilled
 england kii pareshaani se bhi kathin pareshaani swayan france ko jhelni padi
 The continental system itself was suicidal for Napoleon and Europe
