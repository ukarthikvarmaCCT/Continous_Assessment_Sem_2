 Main article: Ali ibn Abi Talib and Alawi's descendants initially married Fatima, his dearest wife
 uski mrityu ke baad, vah phir se shaadi kar lee
 He had four children with Fatima, Hasan ibn Ali, Hussain ibn Ali, Zainab Bint Ali and Umm Kulthum Bint Ali
 unke anya jane-maane bete al-abbaas ebn ali the, jo fatima binate hijaam or mohammad ebn al-hanafiyah ke liye paidaa hue the
 Muhammad ibn al-hanafiyyah was from the Hanifa dynasty of central Arabia, another wife, Ali's son named Khawala bint Jafar
 fatima kii maut ke baad, ali ne bani hanipha janajati ke khawala bint jafar se vivaah kiya
 Hassan, born in 625, was the second Shia Imam and occupied the Khalifa's outward work for nearly six months
 varsh main eech 50 main vah apane ghar ke ek sadsy dwaara jehar or maar daalaa gaya tha, jaisaa ki itihaaskaaron dwaara jimmedaar tehraaya gaya tha, muaayah dwaara prerit kiya gaya tha
 Hussain, born in 626, was the third Shia Imam
 vah muaayah dwaara daman or utpeedan kii gambhir paristhitiyon main rahete the
 On the tenth day of Muharram of the year 680, he stood in front of the Khalifa's army with his small band of followers and nearly all were killed in the Battle of Karbala
 unki mrityu kii saalagirah aashura kaa din kaha jaataa he or yah shiya musalamaanon ke liye shok or dharmik anushthan kaa din he
 Some of Ali's other sons were killed in this battle

 The death of the last is suspected
 kuch itihaaskaaron ne ali ke anya putron ke naam jode hai, jo ibrahim, umr or abdllah ebn al-asakar samet karbala main maare gaye the
 His daughter Zainab — who was in Karbala — was captured by Yazid's army and later played a large role in revealing what happened to Hussein and his followers
 fatima dwaara ali ke vanshajon ko sharif, kahaniyaan yaa kahaniyon ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 These are venerable titles in Arabic, Sharif means 'great' and is said or said or 'god' or 'sir'
 mohammad ke ekmaatr vansh ke rup main, unhen sunni or shiya donon kaa sammaan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from Muhammad, there is no one in Islamic history that has been written in Islamic languages as Ali
 muslim samskruti main, ali ko unke saahas, gyaan, vishwaas, eemaandaaree, islam ke prati samarpan, mohammad ko gahari vafadari, sabhi musalamaanon ke samaan upachaar or parajeet dushmano ko kshamaa karne main udaartaa ke liye sammanit kiya jaataa he, or isliye rahasyamay paramparaon ke liye centre he islam main sufiwaad jaise
 Ali retains his stature as an authority on Quranic exegesis, Islamic jurisprudence and religious thought
 ali lagbhag sabhi sufi adeshon main ucch sthaan rakhata he jo unke madhyam se mohammad ko unke vansh kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Ali's influence has been significant throughout Islamic history
 sunni or shiya vidwaan is baat se sahamat hai ki vilaah kii kavita ali ke sammaan main sunai gai thi, lekin vilaayah or imamet kii alag-alag vyakhyaayein hai
 Sunni scholars believe that the poem is about Ali, but he is not identified as an Imam, in Shia Muslim thought, that Ali was chosen by God as Muhammad's successor
 ali yaa anya shiya imam kaa zikr karte hue shiya vidwaanon dwaara vyakhya kiye gaye kai chand hai
 Answering the question as to why the names of the Imams are not mentioned in the Quran, Muhammad al-baqir answers: "allah revealed salat to his Prophet but never said about the three or four rak'ahs, Revealed Zakat but did not mention its details Haj but its Tawaf and Prophet were not counted
 unhone is kavita kaa khulaasa kiya or paigambar ne kaha ki yah kavita ali, hasan, hossain or baarah imam ke bare main he
 "according to Ali a quarter of Quranic verses are telling the Imam's station
 mamen ne in chhandon main se kai ko shiya islam ke parichay main soochibaddh kiya he
 However, there are some verses that some Sunni commentators interpret in the context of Ali, among which Villah's verse that Sunni and Shiite scholars refer to the incident Ali gave his ring to a beggar who prayed rituals in the mosque Asked the devotees
 mavadda kii kavita chhandon main se ek he, donon sunni or shiyite ne ali ke naam ko kuch anya naamon ke saath joda
 The above verse of Mubhala, and also verse 2: 269 in which Ali is honored with unique knowledge by both Shia and Sunni commentators such verses
 shiya mohammad ke baad ali ko sabase mahatvapurn vyakti maanate hai or vah apni smriti main ek jatil, puranic vyakti kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 He is a paragon of virtues, such as courage, greatness, honesty, straightforwardness, eloquence and deep knowledge
 ali dharmi tha lekin anyaay kaa saamana karnaa padaa, vah aadhikarik tha lekin dayaalu or vinamr, joardaar lekin marij bhi, siikhaa lekin shramik vyakti bhi tha
 According to Shia, Muhammad suggested on various occasions during his lifetime that Ali should be the leader of Muslims after his death
 yah kai hadison dwaara samarthit he, jinhen shams dwaara sunaaya gaya he, jisamen khum ke talab ke haddees, do bharpurn chizon ke haddees, kalam or paper ke haddees, clok ke haddees, pad ke haddees, nimath ke nimantran kareebi parivaar, or baarah uttaradhikari ke haddees 
 Jafar al-sadiq narrates in the Hadith that whatever virtue found in Muhammad was found in Ali, who would turn away from Allah and his Prophet, under his guidance
 ali swayan varnan karata he ki vah allaah tak pahunchane ke liye pravesh dwaar or paryvekshak he
 According to this view, Ali as Muhammad's heir did not rule the community in justice, but also interpreted Sharia law and its esoteric meaning
 isliye unhen truti or paap se mukt mana jaataa tha, or mohammad ke madhyam se divya decri dwaara bhagwaan dwaara niyukt kiya gaya tha
 It is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shi Islam that 'ekal was the source of divine wisdom, the spirits of the prophets and the Imams and was given esoteric knowledge called Goom and their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees
 yadhyapi imam ek divya prakaashan kaa praptakarta nahin tha, phir bhi vah bhagwaan ke saath ghanishtha sambandh tha, jiske madhyam se bhagwaan use maargdarshan karata he, or imam badale main logon kaa maargdarshan karata he
 His words and deeds are a guide and model for the community; as a result it is the source of Sharia law
 shiya tirthayatri aamtaur par ziyaarat ke liye najaaf main mashad ali jate hai, vahaan prarthana karte hai or " ziyaarat amin allaah " yaa anya ziyaaratnanaam padhate hai
 Under the Safavid Empire, his tomb became the center of much devoted attention, exemplified by Shah Ismail i in his pilgrimage to Najaf and Karbala
 kai shiya muslim bhi imam ali kii jayanti ko pita diwas ke rup main manaate hai
 Gregory date changes every year for: mukhya lekh: ali ke sunni drishysunise ali ko chauthe khalipha ke rup main dekhte hai
 Ali is also known as one of the greatest warrior champions of Islam
 udaahranon main trench kii ladaai main kurish champion ko shaamil karnaa shaamil he jab kisi or ne dar nahin diya
 After several unsuccessful attempts to break the fort at the Battle of Khyber, Ali was summoned, miraculously recovered and the fort was conquered
 lagbhag sabhi sufi aadesh ali ke madhyam se mohammad ko apni vanshavali kaa pataa lagaate hai, jo abu bakar ke madhyam se jane vaale nakshabandi ke apwaad hai
 Even in this order, Ali's great great grandson is Jafar al-sadiq
 sufi kaa maananaa he ki ali ne mohammad se santrupt shakti vilaah se viraasat main pravesh kiya jo bhagwaan ko aadhyatmik yatra sambhav banaata he
 Like the famous Sufi Ali Huwiri claims that the tradition started with Ali and regarded the Junayd of Baghdad as the Ali Sheikh doctrines and practices of Sufiism
 suphis ne ali kii prashansa main maanakabat ali ko padhaa 
 Ali is recorded in some traditions as forbidden to those who sought to worship him in his lifetime
 jaise kuch samoohon Alawites vishwaas he ki ali parameshwar tha daawa kar rahe hai avatar
 He is described as Ghulat by the majority of Islamic scholars
 paramparaagat musalamaanon ke mutabik, in samoohon main islam chhod diya gaya he kyonki ve maanav ke prashansaneey gunon ke atvaad ke kaaran hai
 In ali-illahism, a syncretic belief has been consistently there at the religion centers incarnation of their deity throughout history, and reverence especially for Bhandar 'ali, the son of Muhammad, is considered one such incarnation
 druj, ek samadharmi dharm, maanate hai ki bhagwaan tha avatarit manushya main vishesh rup se, al-hakim bi-amr allaah ali ke vanshaj
 See also: Historiography of early Islam The primary sources for scholarship on the life of Ali are the Quran and Ahmadi, along with other texts of early Islamic history
 vyapak madhyamik sroton main, sunni or shia musalamaanon, isai arabon, hinduon or madhya purv or asia ke anya gaiyr-musalamaanon ke lekhan or aadhunik pashchimi vidwaanon dwaara kuch kaaryon ke alaava, shaamil hai
 However, some of the earliest Islamic sources are colored by a positive or negative bias towards Ali
 in kathanon ke khilaaf pehle pashchimi vidwaanon ke bich ek aam pravriti rahi thi or baad main sunni or shia pakshpatpurna padon kii pravriti ke kaaran baad kii avadhi main ekatrit reportein huin; baad main banaavat ke rup main unke bare main aise vidwaan
 This led him to consider some of the reported programs as informal or irrelevant

 Wilferd Madelung has rejected the stance of blindly dismissing everything not included in "early sources" and there is no evidence for a late origin to the trend alone in this approach
 unke anusaar, kaitani kaa drushtikon asangat he
 Madelung and some later historians do not reject narratives compiled in later periods and try to judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with events and figures
 abbasid khaliphot ke udai tak, kuch kitaaben likhi gayi or adhikansh report maukhik thim
 The previous most notable work of this period is the book of Sulem ibn Qays, written by Sulem ibn Qays, who was one of Ali's companions who lived before Abbasid

 Charlie Mitton went to Columbia in search of better pay, but United's remaining old players managed to win the first-class title back in 1952
 Busby knew that football teams needed more than just experience and so he adopted the policy of bringing players from the youth team whenever possible
 Initially young players such as Roger Byrne, Bill Fox, Mark Jones and Dennis Violet took the time to establish themselves in the team, dropping to eighth place in 1953, but with an average age of just 22 in 1956
 Won the league again, scoring 103 goals to achieve it
 The youth policy initiated by Busby has now become the hallmark of the most successful time in the club's history

 By now, rumors of club closing and withdrawal from all competitions had begun to spread, but with Busby taking over as manager while he was recuperating, the club continued to play with temporary players
 Despite the accident, he again reached the final of the FA Cup, where he lost to Bolton Wanderers

 Busby spent the early 1960s rebuilding the team, signing players such as Dennis Law and Pat Crearend and preparing a new generation of youth
 Perhaps the most famous of this new batch was a young man named George Best from Belfast

 United struggled to find an alternative to Busby and the team finished disappointingly eighth in the 1969–70 season, led by Wilf mcginnis, and after a poor start to the 1970–71 season, mcginniz was He was again demoted to the position of reserve team coach
 basbi club main keval chah maheenon ke liye dobaaraa aane ke liye maan gayi
 The results continued to improve with Busby's guidance, but he eventually left the club forever in the summer of 1971
 Meanwhile, United had lost a large number of high-level players such as Nobi Styles and Pat Crerand

 For example, if the properties and behavior of the brain cells of humans are tested, it is difficult to understand the properties of "friendship" from this fine study, although it is the origin of the human brain itself
 isi prakaar se agar anuon va parmaanuon ko dekha jaye to yah anumaan lagaana kathin he ki inase ek aankh ban sakati he jis se drushti pradaan hoti he

 It is called the oldest religion in the world
 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers

 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"

 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many
 fir bhi, wo mukhya siddhanth, jo zyaadaatar hindu maanate hai, in sab main vishwaas: dharm, karm, punarjanm kaa sansaarik chakra, moksh or beshak, ishwar
 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary
 hindu dharm ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi praaniyon main aatma hoti he
 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent

 Reincarnation Belief: True Hinduism
 
 That is, one who has devotion in Gomata, who has a worshiping mantra, who believes in rebirth - he is a Hindu
 merutantra 33 prakaran ke anusaar ' hinan doodhyati sa hindu ' arthath jo hin ko dooshit samajhataa he vah hindu he
 According to Lokmanya Tilak- Asindho: Sindhuparyanta Yesya Bharatbhumika
 pitrubhuh punyabhushchaev sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai

 janm-maran ke chakra main aatma swayan nirlypt rahte hue aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 With the effect of good karma, a person can be born in an aristocratic home or vagina, while bad karma has to be born in a bad vagina

 After that the soul attains its true satti-joy nature forever
 maanav yoni hi akelaa aisa janm he jisamen manushya ke karm, paap or punyamay fal dete hai or sukarm ke dwaara moksh kii prapti mumkin he
 The same beliefs about soul and rebirth are also the basis of Buddhism and Sikhism
 hindu dharm ke pavitra granthon ko do bhaagon main baanta gaya he- shruti or smriti
 Shruti is the supreme text of Hinduism, which is completely unchanging, that is, it cannot be changed in any era
 smriti granthon main desh-kalanusaar badlaav ho saktaa he
 Vedas under the Shruti: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda Brahma Sutras and Upanishads
 veda shruti isaliye kahe jate hai kyonki hinduon kaa maananaa he ki in vedon ko paramatma ne rishiyon ko sunaaya tha, jab ve gahare dhyaan main the
 The Vedas were given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition
 har veda main chaar bhaag hai- samhita—mantra bhaag, brahman-granth—gadhy bhaag, jisamen karmkand samajhaaye gayi hai, aaranyak—inamen anya good baaten samajhaai gayi hai, upanishad—inamen brahm, aatma or inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 If there is a dispute between Shruti and Smriti then only Shruti will be valid
 shruti ko chhodkar anya sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All Smriti texts praise the Vedas

 Mohammad Rafi was born on 24 December 1924 near Kotla Sultan Singh, Amritsar
 aarambhik balykaal main hi inkaa parivaar lahore se amritsar aa gaya
 His family had nothing to do with music
 jab rafi chote the tab inke bade bhai kii nai dukaan thi, rafi kaa kaaphi vakt vahiin par gujarata tha
 It is said that when Rafi was seven years old, he followed a fakir passing through his elder brother's shop who used to sing from there
 uski aawaaj rafi ko pasand ai or rafi uski nakal kiya karte the
 People also liked his voice after seeing avalata in his copy
 log nai dukaan main unke gane kii prashansha karne lage
 But Rafi got nothing but local fame from this
 inke bade bhai mohammad hamid ne inke sangeet ke prati inaki ruchi ko dekha or unhen ustad abdul vaahid khan ke paas sangeet shiksha lene ko kaha
 Once Akashwani came to Lahore to perform his famous singer-actor Kundan Lal Sehgal
 isko sunne hetu mohammad rafi or unke bade bhai bhi gaye the
 Sehgal refused to sing due to the power failure
 rafi ke bade bhai ne aayojakon se nivedan kiya kii bheed kii vyagrata ko shant karne ke liye mohammad rafi ko gane kaa mauka diya jaay
 He got permission and this was Mohammad Rafi's first public performance at the age of 13
 prekshkon main shyaam sundar, jo us samay ke prasiddh sangeetkaar the, ne bhi unako suna or kaaphi prabhavit hue
 He invited Mohammad Rafi to sing for himself
 mohammad rafi kaa pratham geet ek punjabi film gul baloch ke liye tha jise unhone shyaam sundar ke nirdesan main 1944 main gaaya
 In 1946, Mohammad Rafi decided to come to Bombay
 unhen sangeetkaar naushaad ne pehle aap naam kii film main gane kaa mauka diya
 Rafi got fame in the Hindi world for the first time with the song Tera Toy Broken by Naushad
 iske baad shahid, mela tathaa dulaari main bhi rafi ne gane gaae jo bahut prasiddh hue
 In 1951, when Naushad was composing songs for the film Baiju Bawra, he thought of losing his favorite singer Talat Mehmood
 kaha jaataa he ki unhone ek baar talat mahmud ko dhumrapaan karte dekhakar apana man badal liya or rafi se gane ko kaha
 Baiju Bawra's songs established Rafi as a mainstream singer
 iske baad naushaad ne rafi ko apane nirdesan main kai geet gane ko die
 Around this time, the composer duo shankar-jaikishan liked his voice and also started singing songs from Rafi
 shankar jaykishan us samay raaj kapur ke pasandida sangeetkaar the, par raaj kapur apane liye sirf mukesh kii aawaaj pasand karte the
 Later, when the demand for Shankar Jaikishan's songs increased, he used Rafi Sahab almost everywhere
 yahan tak kii kai baar raaj kapur ke liye rafee sahab ne gaaya
 Soon, music composer Sachin Dev Burman and notably OP Nayyar got very pleased with Rafi's voice and started singing Rafi
 o pi naiyyar kaa naam isamen smaraneey rahegaa kyonki unhone apane niraale andaaj main rafi-aashaa kii jodi kaa kaaphi prayog kiya or unki khanakati dhune aaj bhi us jamaane ke anya sangeetkaaron se alag prathit hoti hai
 Rafi gained a lot of fame with the songs sung under his direction and then became the first choice of composers like Ravi, Madan Mohan, Ghulam Haider, Jaydev, Salil Chaudhary, etc
 dilip kumaar, bharat bhushan tathaa devanand jaise kalakaaron ke liye gane ke baad unke gaanon par abhinay karne waalo kalakaaron kii suchi badhati gai
 For artists like Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar, Joy Mukherjee, Vishwajeet, Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra etc
 Rafi's voice started echoing in the background
 shammi kapur to rafi kii aawaaj se itane prabhavit hue ki unhone apane har gane main rafi kaa istemaal kiya
 While OP Nayyar gave music for him, Shankar Jaikishan sometimes voiced his voice
 chaahe koi mujhe junglee kahe, ehsaan tera hoga mujhapar, ye chand sa roshan cheharaa, divaana hua badal shammi kapur ke upar filmaae gaye lokapriy gaanon main shaamil hai
 Gradually, his fame grew so much that actors started urging him to sing the song
 rajendra kumaar, dilip kumaar or dharmendra to maanate hi nahin the ki koi or gayak unke liye gaae
 
 1950 ke dashak main shankar jaykishan, naushaad tathaa sachindev burman ne rafi se us samay ke bahut lokapriy geet gavaaye
 This trend continued into the 1960s
 sangeetkaar ravi ne mohammad rafi kaa istemaal 1960 ke dashak main kiya
 In 1960, Rafi received his first Filmfare Award for the title song of the movie Chaudhvi Ka Chand
 iske baad gharaana, kaajal, do badan tathaa neelkamal jaisi filmo main in dono kii jodi ne kai yaadgaar nagamen die
 In 1961 Rafi got his second Filmfare Award for Sasural's song Teri Pyari Pyari Surat Ko
 sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant pyarelal ne apana aagaaz hi rafi ke swar se kiya or 1963 main film parasmani ke liye bahut sundar geet banaae
 Be safe in these and it is remarkable when remembered
 1965 main hi lakshmi-pyaare ke sangeet nirdesan main film dosti ke liye gaae geet chaahunga mai tuje sanjh savere ke liye rafi ko teesraa filmphere puraskaar mila
 In 1965, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India

 In 1969, Shakti Samanta was producing a film called Aradhana for which he chose Sachin Dev Burman as the composer
 isi saal dada biimaar pad gaye or unhone apane putr rahul dev burman= avarohan ==1960 ke dashak main apane kariyar ke sheersh par pahunchane ke baad dashak kaa ant unke liye sukhad nahin rahaa
 In 1969, Shakti Samanta was producing a film called Aradhana for which he chose Sachin Dev Burman as the composer
 isi saal dada biimaar pad gaye or unhone apane putr rahul dev burman se gane record karwaane ko kaha
 At that time Rafi went for Hajj
 panchamada ko apane priy gayak kishor kumaar se gavaane kaa mauka mila or unhone rup tera mastaana tathaa mere sapanom kii rani gane kishor da kii aawaaj main record karavaaya
 Both these songs became very popular and actor Rajesh Khanna of this song became very popular among the directors and public
 saath hi gayak kishor kumaar bhi janata tathaa sangeet nirdeshkon kii pehali pasand ban gaye
 After this the expiration of Rafi's singer life began
 hanlanki iske baad bhi unhone kai hit gane diye, jaise ye duniya ye mehfil, ye jo chilman he, tum jo mil gaye ho
 In 1977, he received the sixth and final Filmfare Award of his life for the song Kya Hua Tera Vaada of the film Hum Kisi Sekhon Nahi
 mohammad rafi ek bahut hi samarpit muslim, vyasano se dur rahane vaale tathaa sharmile swabhaav ke aadmi the
 During the time of independence, he preferred to stay in India during Partition
 unhone begum viqalis se shaadi kii or unki saat santan huin-chaar bete tathaa teen betiyaan
 Mohammed Rafi is also known for his greatness
 wo bahut hansmukh or dariyadil the tathaa hameshaa sabaki madad ke liye taiyaar rahete the
 He sang many film songs without taking any money or with very little money
 apane shuruaati dinon main sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant-pyarelal ke liye unhone bahut kam paison main gaaya tha
 His dispute with Lata Mangeshkar over the royalty of the songs is also indicative of his generosity
 us samay lataji kaa kahana tha ki gane gane ke baad bhi un gaanon se hone vaali aamadani kaa ek ansh gayakon tathaa gayikaon ko milanaa chahie
 Rafi saheb was against this and said that once the songs have been recorded and the singer-singers have been paid their fees, they should not expect any more money
 is baat ko lekar dono mahaan kalakaaron ke bich manmutav ho gaya
 Lata refused to sing on the set with Rafi and for years no duet song came out
 baad main abhinetri naragis ke kehane par hi dono ne saath gaanaa chaalu kiya or jewel thief film main dil pukaare gaanaa gaaya
 He died due to cardiac arrest on 31 July 1980

 In the 1970s, the Guinness Book of World Records wrote that Lata Mangeshkar was responsible for recording the most songs, recording a total of 25,000 songs
 rafi ne iskaa khandan karte hue gineez book ko ek chitthee likhi
 Subsequent editions featured the claims of the two singers simultaneously and credited Muhammad Rafi for recording 28,000 songs between 1944 and 1980
 iske baad hui khoj main vishwaas nerurkar ne paaya ki lata ne vastav main 1989 tak keval 5,044 gane gaae the
 Other researchers have also accepted this fact as true
 iske atirikt raju bharatan ne paaya ki 1948 or 1987 ke bich keval 35,000 hindi gane ricard hue
 It is difficult to believe that Rafi sang 28,000 songs, but some sources still cite this number
 is shodh ke baad 1992 main gineez book ne gayan kaa uparokt ricard book se nikaal diya

 Longinus is traditionally believed to be the creator of a work called "sublime element in poetry"
 is kriti main achche lekhan ke prabhaavon kii charchaa he
 The real name of Longinus is not known
 vah unani kavyalochan kaa shikshak tha
 Its period is estimated to be from the first to the third century
 lonzinus ne kavy ko shreshth banane vaale tatwon par vichaar karte hue is siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 He considers the sublime as the element that makes poetry better and the poet the prestige
 yah udaatt mahaan vichaaron sangathit alankaar yojana, abhijatya pad rachana tathaa prabhaav kii garima main nihit he
 They consider Vagadambara Baleta and Bhavadambara as obstructing elements
 jis prakaar bhartiya kavyashastra main kavy ke swaroop or uski aatma ko lekar vibhinn maton kaa pratipaadan hua he usee prakaar paashchaatya aalochana ke kshetra main vibhinn yugon main vibhinn chintakon ne kavy yaa sahitya ke mul tatva kii khoj kii he
 Plato considered simulation to be the core of literature
 inkaa pallavan arestu ne apni drushti se kiya or virechan ko sahitya kaa uddeshy sweekaar kiya
 Similarly, Longinus has a sublime theory
 is siddhanth ke dwaara unhone yah spasht kiya he ki koi bhi kalakriti yaa kavyakruti bina udaatt tatva ke shreshth rachana nahin ho sakati
 The best is the one who has deep thoughts and feelings of the Creator
 rachanaakaar kaa yah anubhuti tatva apni mahanata, udaattata, bhavyata yaa garima ke kaaran rachana ko mahaan banaata he
 Creation or creation gets expression through craft; But the author of the sublime work tries not to worry too much about the beauty of the craft in his creation, to strengthen the feeling contained in it
 is udaatt siddhanth ko prastut karanevaale acharya lonzinus he
 His Greek language name is Longinus and in English language is pronounced 'longinus'
 inaki rachana kaa naam ‘perihutsus’ he, jiskaa angreji main ‘on da sablim’ naam se anuwaad kiya gaya
 This is what is called the sublime in Hindi
 iskaa granth paashchaatya sahitya-shaastra kaa pramukh granth he
 Lonaginus's definition of the sublime and its general introduction as it appears that the term had become so prevalent in his time that he felt no need to give it a detailed introduction
 phir bhi udaatt ke swaroop ko spasht karte hue unhone itnaa kaha- That is, the name of the distinctiveness and superiority of the expression is sublime
 isi ko lakshya karke hindi aalochakon ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki kisi rachana main udaatt tatva upyukt tathaa garimapurna shabd-vidhaan, aaveg ko deept karne vaali alankaar yojana tathaa rachana-vidhaan dwaara abhivyakt hota he
 Longinus described the sublime of poetry as distinct from speech, because in poetry the effect of sublime on the audience is in the form of subjectivity, not as enforcement
 is kaaran lonzinus kii drushti main bhavy kavita vahiin he jo anandatirek ke kaaran hamen itnaa nimagn or tanmay kar de ki ham aisi ucch bhav-bhoomi par pahunch jaae jahaan varnya vishay vidyut-prakaash kii bhanti aalokit ho uthta he
 From this point of view, Longinus can be seen to have a lot of equanimity in the thawed-vedhyantar of Anandatirek and Vishwanath
 udaatt ke swaroop ke antargat lonzinus main manovaigyanik or vyavhaarik donon drushtiyon ko saamne rakhaa
 This is why he has mentioned the internal elements of the sublime on one side and has also discussed its external side
 udaatt mul aadhaar kya he? kya vah vaktaa yaa lekhak kii janmajaat pratibha par aadhaarit hota he yaa uskaa prasphuton shiksha-diksha se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he yaa abhyaas par nirbhar he? in prashnon par vichaar karte hue lonzinus ne madhya maarg kaa anukaran kiya he
 Sublime to his view is neither genius relative to all nor relative to practice
 vastutah udaatt kaa aadhaar vyakti kaa koi ek paksh, ek gun yaa ek pravriti nahin he apitu uske peeche sampoorn vyaktitv kii jhalak hoti he
 Therefore, the creation of a sublime can be a sublime personality
 mahaan pratibhashali ucch vidwaan evam yashasvi charitravaan vyakti hi udaatt yaa udghoshak ho saktaa he
 According to Longinus - "sublime is a reflection of the greatness of the soul
" sachcha udaatt keval unheen main prapya he jinaki chetana udaatt evam vicasonmukh he
 It is quite natural that the words of those whose minds are full of lofty perceptions can be echoed by lofty words
 ’’ In this way, the sublime is concerned not only with the study of talent, study and language, but with the entire personality of the person
 nishkarshtah Its effect is not gradual, incidental and the narrative shines through its unique light
 yadhyapi udaatt ke muladhar sahityakar ke vyaktitv kii mahanata main nihit he phir bhi rachana main udaatt kaa tatva laane main liye lonzinus ne paanch sroton kii charchaa kii he- Out of the above five elements, the first two are part of the birthright ie poet-talent and remaining three are art related features
 udaatt ke stroton main pratham sthaan vichaar kii mahatta kaa he
 This is what Loninus also called the grandeur of the soul by word
 unka spasht kathan he- ‘‘udaatt mahaan kii aatma kii pratidhwani hota he
 "if this importance of the soul is not natural then it can be achieved by excellent ideas
 mahaan shabd unheen ke mukh se nikalate hai jinamein vichaar gambheer or gahan hon
 Only rich writers with great ideas can create sublime
 lonzinus kii yah aisi avadharana he, jisase unki udaatt-prabhaav sambandhi dharna bhi judi hui hai
 The effect of the sublime is atrophy, not persuasion
 yah dharna is baat ko visheshikrut karti hai ki atmaati kraman bhavy or mahaan vichaaron kii garimamayi abhivyakti se hi sambhav he
 In fact, spiritual greatness is the first condition of sublime creation, that is why the effect of sublime will also be considered morally welfare
 is prakaar udaatt sahitya kaa prabhaav naitik tathaa kalatmak donon hi drushtiyon se uttam mana janaa chahie
 From this point of view, Longinus and Grandmother Milton descend on the same level
 milton ke anusaar mahaan sahityakar banane ke liye mahaan or ati sammanneey vastuon kaa anukaran karnaa chahie
 Milton's view is- manasviyon ko yah bhavy vaani sahaj hi praapt ho jaati hai
 Sometimes it happens that the talented poet cools down like the sun setting in the evening of his life and the lack of sublime appears in his later poetry
 odisi main homer kii isi astachal-gamini pratibha ke darshan hote hai
 Longinus states - "elliot is Homer's creation of youthfulness, because it has the essence of motion and struggle
 iske vipareet, odissi kaa bahulansh aakhyanatmak hai, jo budhaape kii dein he

 Longinus emphasizes the imperative of boisterous impulses in the artwork, as it is necessary for the work to be great to provide emotional stimulation to the readers
 bhavavesh yaa bhavy aaveg ve hen jinase ‘aatma’ apane aap upar uthne lagati hai or phir harshollas se bhar jaati hai
 Longinus has created two classes of impulses — one grand and the other inferior
 bhavy aavegon main ucch bhavavesh arthath utkrisht bhaavana prabalya, aadar, vismay, ullas or shaury aadi kii gananaa karte hai, jabaki nimna aavegon kaa sambandh karunaa, shok or bhay se he
 To fill the sublime in poetry, the eclipse of high emotion and low emotion should be discarded
 lonzinus kaa mat he ki alankaaron kaa prayog is kushalta se hona chahie ki is baat par kisi kaa dhyaan na jaae ki vah alankaar he
 When art is used skillfully, it loses its beauty and its configuration of miracles
 vastutah alankaar kii chamatkrit na karen, apitu vah anand hetuk hona chahie
 Longinus considered superlative ornaments to be sublime
 unke anusaar vistaarna, shapathokti, prashnalankar, viparyay, vyatikram, punrariti, pratyakshikaran, sanchay, saar, rup-parivartan, paryyokti, atishyokti aadi alankaaron main udaatt vidyaman rahata hai
 Therefore, it is necessary for the sublime to be spontaneous and justified
 udaahranarth Longineus by poetic expression means poetic language
 unhone bhashaa kii utkrushtataa par vishesh bal diya he; kyonki udaatt kii abhivyakti bhashaa ke madhyam se hoti he
 It is imperative to have a proper, appropriate effect and syllogism of the phrase, because by using energetic language, the creator can create a work that has a bad effect
 upyukt or prabhavi shabdaawalee ke dwaara rachana main bhavyata, garima, oj, madev, shakti aadi gunon kaa samavesh or jeevantata kaa sanchaar hota he
 Rachna-vidhan means symmetric word-plan or word plan in a certain order
 lonzinus ke anusaar vibhinn tattvon kaa parsparik saamanjasy kriti ko garimapurna banaata he
 Just as there is no importance for the different elements of the body to remain independent, the creation of the entire body is possible only when it is found, in the same way, the creation of a dignified work is done by the combination of all the elements
 rachana ke sabhi tatva milakar jab saamanjasy kii shrinkhalaa main bandh jate hai, tabhi un main udaatt aata he
 Otherwise it falls apart
 kabhi-kabhi rachana-tattvon kaa saamanjasy us kshati kii aapurti kar detaa he, jo rachana ke kisi vishesh tatva-dosha se utpann hoti he or is prakaar yah saamanjasy udaatt-prabhaav ko akshunn banaaye rakhata he
 Therefore, the dignified and magnificent composition-law is also the nutrient of sublime-creation
 lonzinus ne udaatt ke virdohi tattvon par bhi vichaar kiya he
 He has considered balata, unrestrained vagvistar, chaotic pedagogy, inferior words, mood and rhetoric, unwanted brevity, unnecessary decor, excessive emphasis on music and rhythm, etc
 as the antithesis of sublime
 atah shreshth kavi ko apni rachana main inhen sthaan nahin dena chahie
 This is a major flaw of the genre
 ‘baley’ kaa shabdic arth he ‘bachakaana’
 Just as agility, numbness, lightness and shortness are found in children, baldness will be considered in that style
 jisamen bina sanyam ke vagsfiti kii jaae, kshudra arth dyotak shabdon kaa prayog ho or chanchal yaa asthir pad-vinyas paaya jaae
 The style becomes artificial in this
 lonzinus ke anusaar- Use of ornate and heavy words in the absence of dignity of feeling
 jaise griddha jaise chote padaarth ke liye ‘jivit samadhi’ shabd kaa prayog
 Vagadambar arises from the attempt of sublime encroachment
 jahaan lekhak madyap kii bhanti aacharan kar praayah anpekshit, nirarthak or asangat aaveg kii abhivyakti karata he arthath jahaan aaveg ke niyantran kii aavashyaktaa hone par bhi aaveg kii abhivyakti kii jaae
 The expression of impulse gives rise to mood and reduces subluxation
 logon ko prabhavit karne ke moh main atishyoktipurna kathan hi shabdaadambar he
 Bihari couplets in Hindi suffer from this defect
 udaahranarth, lonzinus kaa mat he ki stri ke liye chakshu-dansh athwa ‘chakshu-phoduk’ or ‘putali’ ke liye ‘aankh kii kumari’ aadi shabdon kaa prayog maatr shabdaadambar he, bhashaa kaa alankaar nahin he
 In later critics, Hegel compares it to beauty to illustrate the nature of the sublime
 uske matanusaar soundarya kaa arth he saamanjasy
 In beauty, there is a harmony between the object and art aspects
 udaatt kii sthiti sundar se bhinn he
 Sublime is one where his emotion is more expansive and quintessential than his form
 higel yah bhi maanate hai ki udaatt ke mul main vichaaron kii utkrushtataa he or vichaaron kii mahatta vyakti ke ucch charitra se janm paati he
 If the character of a person is great then his thoughts will also be great
 edmund bark ne lonzinus dwaara vivechit pratibha-prasut kalpana tathaa vichaar bhaavana aadi kii vishalata ke aadhaar par udaatt ke swaroop kii spashtikaran karte hue kaha he ki jis vastu yaa rachana main prabhavit karne kii shakti he or jo apane abhinav prabhaav se prekshak ko chakit kar sakati he, vahiin udattatavya samajhnaa chahie
 We can take the example of creation of the sublime element, the great form of Hanuman presented in the pyramid and the beautiful form of ramacharitra-manas, the great form of Krishna in the Mahabharata, etc
 bark ne udaatt-tatva padaarthon ke atirikt dhwani ke bheetar bhi sweekaar kiya he, jaise baari aandhi, vishaal prapaat, bijli kii garaj, topon kii garjana main bhi udaatt-tatva rahata he
 In fact, arrogance is closer than lofty than beauty
 kavi-karm ke rup main anand kii pratishtha lonzinus kii aisi dein he jo ek ore unhen horess jaise alankaar-shastri se or duusari ore arestu jaise kavy-shastri se bhinn karti he
 Aristotle's depiction is a kind of treatment envisaged especially in the context of tragedy, while Longine's 'anand' is a feat whose nutritious foundation extends to all of epic tragedy, progress
 vastutah udaatt kaa vivechan or vishleshan lonzinus ke ‘peri ipsus’ me sarvaadhik rup main hua he
 The lofty theory of Longinus is the result of western review
 unka ‘udaatt’ jivan ke arjeet paksh kii abhivyakti hai, madhur paksh ke liye usamen koi sthaan nahin he
 Therefore, his scripture is incomplete due to discussing half of life
 bhartiya kavyashastra kii purnataa usamen kahan, jisamen oj ke saath maadhurya gun bhi he
 On one side there is heroic and wonderful rasa and on the other hand there is adornment and humor
 vah sampoorn maanav kii kriti he
 The reason for this loneliness in Longinus's belief is that he composed his book as a form of speech, not poetry
 isiilie safal bhaashan ke liye mahatvapurn tattvon kaa hi nirvachan isamen miltaa he

 anant kaa arth hota he jiskaa koi ant na ho

 This term is used for quantities whose steam or calculation is impossible due to their not being finite

 It is clear from the definition of fractions that fractions are the number that multiplies by s and gives the product

 Then it is clear that 0 / s always remains the same, irrespective of the constant number
 ise parimey sankhyaon ko shunya kaha jaataa he or gananaatmak sankhya 0 ke samaan he
 Conversely, v / 0 is a meaningless term
 ise anant samajhnaa bhul he
 If a remains constant in a / y and y decreases and both a and z are positive, then the value of a / y will increase

 The post-engine Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by daimler-motorson-gesellschaft

 "si" ek coop yaa cabriolet body style ko darshata he 
 "D" indicates that the vehicle is equipped with a diesel engine "i" ingit karata he ki vaahan kaa ingine petrol eendhan injection se susajjit he

 The naming framework is divided into four categories: core, off-road vehicle / SUV, 4-door coupe and roadster
