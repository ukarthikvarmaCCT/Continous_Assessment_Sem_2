 chakeri, savai madhopur jila mukhyalay se 20 kilometre dur hai or ye yahan se acchhee tarah se sadak or railmarg dwaara judaa hua hai
 It is a village in the Sanindhya of Makholi railway station on the Delhi Mumbai railroad, where trains are available in the morning and late in the evening
 sadak parivahan ke liye yahan par jeepe mil jaati hai ye par keval shaam or subah hi mil paati hai
 Chakeri comes under Sawai Madhopur Tehsil, Panchayat Samiti, Zilla Parishad, Assembly Constituency, belongs to tonk-sawai Madhopur Constituency for Lok Sabha
 chakeri main gram panchaayat hai
 Village Panchayat elections have also been regular in Chakeri and people have been choosing their representatives on their domestic issues
 chakeri kaa rajanithik taur par kaaphi mahatva hai
 Whenever there is a big election, there are definitely some big gatherings in Chakeri, the reason for this is that its condition adds a lot to the villages
 doosraa chakeri duusare gaanvo ke rajanithik chintan ko prabhavit karata aayaa hai
 The people of Chakeri are politically very aware
 ve sabhi chunaavo ko gambhirtha se lete hai
 The political trend here depends on the trend of elections, which we can understand in this way
 saanskrithik drushti se chakeri savai madhopur soobe main ek alag hi pahchaan rakhata hai, ye kai saanskrithik gatividhiyon kaa ek sangathit centre hai
 Following are the various activities taking place here - gaanv main vibhinn samyo par kai prakaar kii dharmik gatividhia hoti rahati hai
 Chakeri's social status has been an inspiration for many villages
 kai prakaar ke samjik halaato par chakeri kaa udahaaran diya jaataa hai
 The people of Chakeri have moved forward in various fields through awareness and are illuminating the name of the village
 gaanv main kai jatiyon ke log rahete hai ,kahawat hai kii saato jatiya rahati hai
 The people of the Meena caste are the majority
 duusari jatiyon main nath, bramhan, jain, bairava, dhobi, gavaaria, nai, chamaar, raigar, harijan, koli, gurjar, khatic, raav va rajput aadi shaamil hai
 All people believe in Hinduism
 alp maatra main log muslim dharm ko bhi maanate hai
 The primary functions of the Meenas are farming and animal husbandry
 meenaon ke alaava nath, bairava, brahman, jain or gurjar bhi kheti karte hai
 In which Brahmins and Jains have settled in the cities by obtaining other employment and have either shared their land or left it
 jo yahaan par rah bhi rahe hai uname se zyaadaatar ne saajhe de die hai
 There were many farms in Bairwao, but they were sold there due to lack of water, although their land could not be taken account of due to SC ACT, but the way they have sold, they have almost lost their ownership
 nath samudaay ke kuch log apni jameen par pani kii sahi uplabdhta ke kaaran kheti kaary main salagn hai,phir bhi iname se bahut saare to kheti-baadi chhod chuke hai
 In this way, we can say that the farming activities are done only by the Meenas
 meenaon main padhai-likhaai kaa str pehle bahut kam tha, is vajah se unka ekmaatr jeevikaparjan kaa saadhan kheti baadi hi thi or iname se nammaatr ke log hi naukari karte the
 But later, due to lack of water, farming started decreasing, due to increase in population, the farms were also divided and production decreased, due to which they realized the need of jobs
 iske baad inhone apane baccho kii padhai-likhaai par dhyaan diya taaki wo pard-likhakar rojgaar dhund sake or ek sammanjanak jivan ji sake
 Since then, many youths have been educated and many have gone to cities for higher education
 ab inhi kisaano ke kai chaatr to doctor, ejeeniyar or sarkari afasar tak ban gaye hai or aane vaali peedi bhi inase prerit hokar aage bad rahi hai
 Now farmers have started thinking that "we have cut our lives in pain and pain, but our sons will not live like this, we will put a lot of blood and sweat to improve their lives"
 Farmers take loans to save their school, college , Are paying coaching fees, are spending on living outside them
 par sabase badi baat hai kii chakeri main ab ausatan ek ghar main se ek naukar ho gaya hai
 In this way, Minao has also started the exercise to improve their standard of living by making education a weapon
 chakeri ke log pragatisheel vichaaro ke hai
 Those who give equal status to women also
 gaanv main mahilao kii sthiti ko nimna uddharanon ke madhyam se drushtigochar kar sakate hai
 Some societies in the village are still engaged in Jajmani practice
 jajmaani pratha mughalo ke samay bani thi jasme kuch varg anaaj ke badale apni sevaaye dete the, uname se kai virgo ne apane pushtaini kaary ko rojgaar ke taur par jari rakhaa or uske aadhaar par apana jivan vyateet karte rahe
 Due to this, other classes also got services without any hassle
 in virgon main se kuch abhi bhi sakriya hai
 However many have stopped doing this work and now do so by receiving cash payments
 chakeri kii adhikansh jansankhya khetibari main karyrat hai
 Due to the increase in population, the size of the fields is small, and the number of marginal farmers has increased
 kai samudaayon ke log apane paramparaagat kaaryo main bhi lage hai jaise kii-nai, raav ityadi Many works have been done by this village panchayat, as well as many work has been done by MLA and MP quota due to good behavior from politicians in the village, here we can see about them
 shiksha ke madhyam se gaanv main kaaphi jagriti ai hai ,khaskar navayuvak varg main
 Educational institutions available in Chakeri are - chakeri sabhi aasapaas ke gaanvo se sadak dwaara acchhee tarah judaa huha hai, tathaa jila mukhyalay se bhi acchhee connactivity hai
 Even inside Chakeri, all the routes are almost restricted, which gives the villagers the right kind of transport throughout the year
 pehle logo ko khaskar barsaat ke dauraan badi pareshaani uthaani padati thi kyunki pakki sadako ke abhaav main gaare kii samasya rahati thi
 In this way we can understand the relationship and engagement with the nearby villages, Chakeri shares his land revenue limit with all these villages
 isliye jin gaanv waalo ke kankad ke aas paas khet hote hai, ve apni kheti sambandhi chijo ke liye duusare gaanv ke kisaano se madad lete yaa karte rahete hai ,jaise kii - pani sambandhi bharaai or palaav kii jarurate, jot aadi
 Due to all these collaborations, good relations are formed between them, and they go to each other
 chakeri ko ab aadhunik maahaul main daalane par jor is abhiyaan ke tahat kiya ja rahaa hai
 So that the people of the village can keep pace with the changes coming in the world
 gaanv kii nai peedi pard-likhakar aage bad chuki hai, agar inke hisaab se suvidhaae gaanv main viksit nahi kii gai to ye shahar main jaakar bas jaaenge
 From this scenario some work has been done in the village like - inke alaava abhi bhi kai suvidhaaye gaanv ke andar viksit hona baaki hai
 And many pre-installed facilities need to be improved
 jin chijo par dhyaan dene kaa prastaav is abhiyaan ke tahat kiya gaya hai wo is prakaar hai - The village needs to take active participation in some government efforts to keep pace with the changes that are being made

 This is called fault

 Many eruptions are also the origin of flat springs, the internal water comes to the surface only by them

 The stones at the site of fault are smooth

 Apart from this, sudden disappearance of levels, or two levels of the same level, the presence of corrupted debris, etc
 are other seekers to identify the errors

 The plane on which the rocks break, is called the fault plane

 Displacement of rocks occurs under the influence of fault
 lambavat visthaapan ko urdhwadhar visthaapan tathaa kshaitij disha main visthaapan ko kshaitij visthaapan kehete hai
 As a result of the fault, the part which remains relatively above is called uptake and the part which comes down relatively is called inundation
 bhransh kai prakaar ke hote hai
 The main among them are given below: The fault, in which the stones on one side move downwards from their original place , is called a sequence fault

 This is called utterance

 But if the fault is neither in the direction of salutation nor is it perpendicular to the direction of salutation, then it is called oblique or oblique fault
 kabhi kabhi shilaon main ek ke baad doosraa, phir teesraa, is prakaar kai bhransh hote hai
 If the direction of elevation of these faults is on one side, then the formation of the shape of a ladder is made
 in bhranshon ko sopanbhransh naam diya gaya he
 If two faults progress toward each other, the area between the two ruptures goes down relatively

 The meaning and merit of the word 'acharya' has been considered in detail
 nirukt ke anusaar usko acharya isliye kehete hai ki vah vidhyaarthee se achaarshastron ke arth tathaa buddhi kaa aachyan karaata he
 According to the Apastamb Dharmasutra, he is said to be an Acharya because the student studies religion from him
 acharya kaa chunaav bade mahatv kaa hota tha
 'he enters darkness from darkness to darkness, which he does not believe in
 isliye kuleen, vidyasampann tathaa samyak prakaar se santulit buddhivaale vyakti ko acharya pad ke liye chunanaa chahie

 This story is about a man, Dhani Ram, who belongs to an elite family but has killed money and who has mortgaged his house, wife's jewelery, his insurance policy, etc
 to get his son Madan a good training
 But he wants to see his son in a government job
 madan ko bi
 e
 ke imtihaan ke liye 200 ru chahie hote hai jo ki uske pita ke paas nahin hai
 Madan mortgages his mother's silver Jagannath statue
 madan bi
 e
 paas ho jaataa he lekin padhai ke chalate-chalate usko apni sahpaathee indu se pyaar bhi ho jaataa he
 Madan wanders in search of a job but he does not get a job anywhere
 thak haar ke wo apane dhobi ke samajhaae hue raste par, ki haath kii mehnat kursi kii mehnat se kahin badi siddh hoti he, apane hi dhobi ke saath kaam karne lagata he
 Here Madan goes to his girlfriend's house and learns that the aristocratic person he had a clash with at Dhobi Ghat the previous day is Indu's father Diwan Kulwant Rai, so they disown their relationship
 jab uske pita ko is baat kaa pataa chalata he ki wo dhobigiri kar rahaa he to wo bhi madan ko ghar se nikaal dete hai
 Madan confronts him that he has not committed any theft nor begging anywhere but this does not affect his father and Madan is forced to leave the city but Indu says that he too Will go with him
 tay shuda vaqt par jab indu nahin aati he, kyonki uske pita ne use ghar se bhaagate hue pakad liya tha, to bechaara madan akele hi apni raah nikal padataa he
 Arriving in Mumbai, Madan starts a business of printing in clothes and upon seeing this, his business starts
 udhar madan kii bahan kii shaadi kaa vaqt aa jaataa he par dhani ram ke paas iske liye paise nahin hote hai
 He goes to his business friend who tells him that he does not have money at this time, so Dhani Ram should arrange the money from somewhere else and after a few days he will give this money to Dhani Ram
 dhani ram paison ke liye maaraa-maaraa phirata he lekin kahin se bhi use paise nahin milte hai
 Finally, on the trust of his friend, Dhani Ram, who is a treasurer in a government department, withdraws 5000 rupees from his treasury but that friend's business is destroyed and he is unable to pay even a single penny to the rich Ram
 is
 dhani ram ke paas koi bhi vikalp nahin bachataa he sivaay iske ki wo khudakshi kar le
 And he jumps into the river to die
 uske ghar kii nilaamee ho jaati he or unka dhobi madan kii maan or uski choti bahan ko panaah detaa he
 When Madan comes home after earning some money, he finds that his house is scattered
 wo jagannatha kii murti ko apni maan ke liye girvee se chhudaa kar laata he
 When he goes on the day of his sister's in-law brother Dooj, his sister's mother-in-law expels him from the house
 vahaan se lautate vaqt wo dekhtaa he ki uski premika kaa vivaah ho rahaa he
 But he does not know that his girlfriend has been informed that he is in this city and his girlfriend chases his bus in his car and crashes and answers his legs
 indu kaa mangetar uski har sambhav sahaayta karne ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he
 On the other hand, Madan goes to the city with his mother, younger sister and washerman, whom he has accepted as his mentor
 vahaan uskaa kaarobaar din dooni raat chauguni taraqqi kar rahaa he
 Madan's father somehow escapes drowning, and ironically, he finds a job in Madan's factory in search of hard work
 ant main madan ko indu or dhani ram mil jate hai or madan kii bahan kii saas bhi use apana leti he kyonki uske paas ab dhan daulat aish-o-aaraam sab kuch he

 " bhraman kii ruparekha- On Friday, April 6, 2018, we reached the Saravan Bhureshwar temple along with my friend Sushil from our village
 Whose distance is 9 kilometers from our village
 But before reaching the temple we found a snake with its face on both sides
 We stopped there and saw that snake
 After that, they reached the temple
 Baba Birendra Das met there and Baba Birendra Das ji informed about the present situation from the construction of the temple, after that he told that you will give the remaining information to Santosh Bhadoria, he is the minister of the present king from whom all information is available to him
 Because the king Virendra Vikram Singh does not allow anyone to do any work on this temple
 mandir kaa avlokan- We saw the entire state of the temple and saw that there are doors in 3 directions, the main door is east, the second door is to the north and the third door is to the south, and asked the reason for the position of these doors
 So it was told that on the day of Shivratri, a lot of devotees come, due to which the whole people are not able to see through 1 door, due to this, different 2 doors were installed in which Women go from one side and men from one side, and people come out slowly from the east side
 Due to the white Shivling, this temple got its name as Bhureshwar Mahadev Temple
 Millions of Kanwarias visit Lodheshwar Mahadev place in Ramnagar in Barabanki district

 On the same day, a large number of devotees are expected to come here on Shivaratri
 Keeping this in mind, the workers of the temple start cleaning and decorating the temple about 15 days in advance, the King of Saravanan Virendra Vikram Singh told that the temple is about 1400 years old
 And Raja Shravan Dev of the princely state once visited Hastinapur
 There Shiva asked him to come in a dream and install the Shiva lingam, from there the king had brought the small idol, and had kept it in a place near the village and wanted to install it at some sacred place
 Even after this, the king and others could not redeem this idol with a mole, finally The king forced and got the idol installed there
 Since then, this Shivling is established in this place
 The name of the village is recorded in old papers in the name of Raja Shravan, but due to the fluency of the language, the word 'shravan' became common in the dialect of the village and the word 'saravan' became the name of the village since then
 This temple was named Bhureshwar Mahadev due to Shivling's white color
