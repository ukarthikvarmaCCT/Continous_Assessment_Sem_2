 He prepared high level text books for the students

 Shyam Sundar Das was active in literary service till the last moment of his life
 swatantraaa se thik pehle or baad kii hindi kii puri peedi hi babuji ke kandhon par baithkar hi badi hui
 From time to time, the number of his statements given in conferences on various subjects are countless
 is samast chintan par drushti daalane par yah spasht ho jaataa he ki ve kis tarah hindi sahitya ko anek vishyon se jodakar aage badhanaa chaahate the
 Even today Babuji's great contribution is the authentic composition of the text and the wisdom of the field of study
 vidhyaarthiyon ke liye tazaa saamagree laane ke unke har kshan ke prayaas kaa nateeja yah hua ki ve sangrahakaar banate rahe
 It is criticized that this is why his writing became profound and lacked originality
 lekin dekhne kii baat yah he ki unki samanvayvaadee buddhi anek gyaan- kshetron kii saamagree-sangrah main nimagn rahi
 Even in practical-criticism, Babuji established the beauty of harmony
 isiilie unki aalochana main tulana, aitihaasik drushti, vyakhya, bhashya aadi kaa pravesh hota gaya
 In this way, he also prepared the initial path of practical-criticism in Hindi
 unka yah kushal netritv aage chalakar hindi-bhashi kshetra ke liye vardaan siddh hua
 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has written a variety of essays, both reflective and emotional
 unke nibandhon ke vishay main paryaapt vividhta he
 He also wrote on many untouched subjects, poets are discovered and their talent is seen in historical essays
 babu shyaam sundar das kii bhashaa shuddh saahitiyik hindi he, jisamen sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii pradhanta he
 In relation to the language, his idea was - 'when we accept foreign words with foreign expressions, then make them so that the foreignness comes out of them and they become disciplined by our grammar rules
 ' isliye jahaan kahin unhone apni bhashaa main 'urdu' ke prachlit shabdon kaa prayog kiya he, vahaan unka urdupan nikaal diya he, kalam, kavayad, kanoon aadi shabdon ke neeche kii bindi hataakar or unke uccharan badal kar unhone unka prayog liya he
 Similarly, by removing the rarity of Sanskrit words, they are written in Hindi in a simple way - like work in place of work, anjan in place of anjan
 shabd chayan ke bare main babu shyamsundar das kaa mat tha- 'sabase pehla sthaan shuddh hindi ke shabdon ko, uske peeche sanskrit ke sugam or prachlit shabdon ko, iske peeche farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke saadhaaran or prachlit shabdon kaa or sabase peeche sanskrit ke aprachlit shabdon ko sthaan diya jaae
 Never use difficult words in foreign languages like Persian
 babu shyaam sundar das ne mukhyatah do prakaar kii shaileyon main likhaa he- 1
 Deliberative style - Deliberative essays are written in the reflective style

 premamayi gopikaon kaa yah aacharan bada hi romantic he
 Unnaturalness could not come from anywhere
 2
 gaveshnatmak style- gaveshnatmak nibandhon main gaveshnatmak style kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 The sentences are relatively few long
 bhashaa ke tatsam shabdon kii adhikta he
 Due to the intensity and dryness of the subject it is somewhat dry and devoid of style
 is prakaar kii style kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie- 'this life struggle is beginning to seem even more intense and painful due to the attrition of two different civilizations
 is avasthaa ke anukool hi jab sahitya utpann hokar samaaj ke mastishk ko protsaahit or prati kriyman karegaa tabhi vaastavik unnati ke lakshan dekh padenge or uskaa kalyankari fal desh ko aadhunik kaal kaa gaurav pradaan karegaa
 Decoration of ornaments is not found in any type of style of Babu Shyam Sunderdas
 kahawaton or muhaavaron kaa prayog to nahin ke baraabar hua he
 To explain his ideas well, Babu Shyam Sundar Das has repeated the same thing with the words' Summary is' or ',' such as' etc
 hindi sahitya main babu shyaam sundar das kaa sthaan unke hindiprachaarak or hindi unnayak ke rup main
 He composed many original texts

 In 1907, he established the Hindi Arya Language Library, edited ancient important texts and also started the production of text books according to the level of education
 ramchandra shukla ne hindi sahitya kaa itihaas main likhaa he : Shyam Sundar Das was not only an institute-maker, but was also unmatched in management
 sahitya ke samast kshetron ke abhaavon ko dur karne ke liye unhone sankalpabaddh hokar shram kiya
 Due to his achievements as a language philosopher or as a lecturer of the principles, literary literature remained a destiny of Hindi students for a long time
 inke man main yah dharna nirbhaant rahi ki hindi kii saidhantik samiksha kaa aadhaar sanskrit or pashchimi aalochana-siddhanton ko mila kar or unhen ek khaas saamanjasy ke saath hi banaaya janaa chahie
 Prior to Shyam Sundar Das there was a particularly critical time for Hindi and Nagari script
 pratap narayan mishra ne kai sthanon par hindi ke prachaar ke liye sabhaayen sthapit kii thim
 One such meeting was established in 1884 in Prayag under the name of 'hindi Savarni Pratik Madhya Bharat Sabha'
 sarkari dacrataron main nagari ke pravesh ke liye bhaaratendu harishchandra ne bhi kai baar udhyam kiya, par unhen safalataa nahin mil saki
 Despite this, the effort continued
 adalati bhashaa urdu hone ke kaaran navshikshiton main urdu padhane waalon kii sankhya adhik thi, jisase hindi pustakon ke prakaashan kaa kaary aage nahin bad paata tha
 In addition to this literature-crisis, the entry of Nagari into the government offices was a grave crisis in front of people who knew it
 isi daur main kuch utsaahi chaatro ke udyog se, jinamein babu shyaam sundar das pramukh the, 1893 main kaashi nagari prachaarini sabha kii sthapana kii gayi
 Here too, remember the statement of Ramchandra Shukla that, 'tell me the truth, all the prosperity and fame of this gathering is the fruit of Babu Shyam Sundar Das's sacrifice and continuous hard work
 ve aadi se ant tak iske pranaswaroop sthit hokar baraabar ise anek bade udyogon main tatpar karte rahe
 Its first chairman was Bharatendu's brother-in-law Radhakrishna Das
 ’ nagari prachaar ke andolan ne hindi-premiyon main nayaa utsaah paidaa kiya or bahut se log sahitya kii shrivriddhi main samarpit bhav se lag gayi

 ayurvigyaan, vigyaan kii vah shakha he jiskaa sambandh maanav sharir ko nirog rakhane, rog ho jane par rog se mukt karne athwa uskaa shaman karne tathaa aayu badhaane se he
 It is that branch of medical science, which is concerned with keeping the human body healthy, freeing or diagnosing the disease in case of disease, and increasing age
 bharat ayurvigyaan kaa janmdata he
 In its early times, medicine was studied in the same way as a branch of biology
 baad main 'sharir rachana' tathaa 'sharir kriya vigyaan' aadi ko iskaa aadhaar banaaya gaya
 The birth of medicine in India was several thousand years BC
 It was initially studied as a branch of biology, and anatomy and physiology were made the basis of it
 sharir main honevaali kriyaaon ke gyaan se pataa laga ki unka rup bahut kuch rasinic he or ye ghatnaayen raasaanik kriyaaon ke fal hai
 As soon as the discovery took place, the chemical form of the events of the body came out
 is prakaar rasayan vigyaan kaa itnaa mahatv badha ki vah ayurvigyaan kii ek pruthak shakha ban gaya, jiskaa naam jeevarsayan rakhaa gaya
 By this, not only the form of physical events became clear, but also the origin of diseases and methods of resistance came out
 saath hi bhautik vigyaan ne bhi shaareerik ghatnaon ko bhalee bhanti samajhane main bahut sahaayta di
 It is known that many events happen according to physical rules
 ab jeevarsayan kii bhanti jeevbhautikee bhi ayurvigyaan kaa ek ang ban gai he or usase bhi rogon kii utpatti ko samajhane main tathaa unka pratirodh karne main bahut sahaayta mili he
 Other branches of science have also helped a lot in disease prevention and medicine
 or in sabake sahyog se manushya ke kalyaan main bahut pragati hui he, jiske falswaroop jeevankaal bad gaya he
 Many kinds of experimental methods and instruments, which have been made from time to time, have been very helpful in acquiring a subtle knowledge of the body, physical phenomena and internal functions related to the disease
 kintu is gahan adhyayan kaa fal yah hua ki ayurvigyaan anek shakhaon main vibhakt ho gaya or prayek shakha main itani khoj hui he, naveen upkaran bane hai tathaa praayogic vidhiyaan gyaat kii gai hai ki koi bhi vidvan yaa vidhyaarthee un sab se purnataya parichit nahin ho saktaa
 Day by day, the doctor has to depend on laboratories and equipment and this dependency is increasing progressively
 prayek shiksha kaa dhyey manushya kaa maansik vikaas hota he, jisase usamen tark karke samajhane or tadnusaar apane bhaavon ko prakat karne tathaa karyanvit karne kii shakti utpann ho jaay
 This is also the aim of medical education
 iske liye sab ayurvigyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon main vidhyaarthee ko upasnaatak ke rup main paanch varsh bitaane padate hai
 In medical colleges, students are admitted on the basis of studying the basic sciences and getting higher secondary education
 tatpashchaat pratham do varsh vidhyaarthee sharirarachana tathaa sharirkriya naamak aadharvigyaanon kaa adhyayan karata he jisase usko sharir kii swaabhaavik dasha kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 After this, three years are spent in getting knowledge of the deformities of these natural conditions due to diseases and in learning the methods of their treatment
 rogon ko rokane ke upaay tathaa bheshajavaidhik kaa bhi, jo is vigyaan kii niti sambandhi shakha he, vah isi kaal main adhyayan karata he
 After these five years of study, he becomes a graduate
 iske pashchaat vah ek varsh tak apni ruchi ke anusaar kisi vibhaag main kaam karata he or us vishay kaa kriyaatmak gyaan praapt karata he
 Thereafter, he can join a department to get a diploma or degree in postgraduate teaching
 sab ayurvigyaan mahavidhyalay kisi na kisi vishvavidhyalay se sambandhit hote hai jo unki parikshaon tathaa shikshankram kaa sanchaalan karata he or jiskaa uddeshy vigyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon main tark kii shakti utpann karnaa or vigyaan ke nae rahasyon kaa udghaatan karnaa hota he
 The aim of every teacher and student of medical schools should also be that he should try to advance the art of this antidote by searching for new anti-inflammatory items
 itnaa hi nahin, shikshakon kaa jeevanalakshya yah bhi hona chahie ki vah aise anveshak utpann karen
 The centerpiece of medical practice is the general practitioner who keeps in close contact with the public or families and helps them when needed
 vah apane rogiyon kaa mitra tathaa paramarshdaata hota he or samay par unhen darshanik santvanaa dene kaa praytn karata he
 He is familiar with simple problems related to the disease and goes to distant places, villages, etc
 and serves the patients
 yahan usko sahaayta ke ve sab upkaran nahin praapt hote jo usne shikshan kaal main dekhe the or jinka prayog usne siikhaa tha
 These become available in large cities
 aavashyaktaa padane par usko visheshgy se sahaayta leni padati he yaa rogi ko aspataal main bhejnaa hota he
 Nowadays, some doctors become experts after studying a particular branch of this science
 is prakaar hridayrog, maansik rog, asthirog, ballrog aadi main visheshgyon dwaara vishisht chikitsa uplabdh he
 Nowadays medical expenses have increased a lot
 rog ke nidaan ke liye aavashyak parikshaayen, moolyavaan aushadhiyaan, chikitsa kii vidhiyaan or upkaran iske mukhya kaaran hai
 The life of the public has also increased due to modern medicine, but there is a lot of expenditure on medicines
 khed he ki vartmaan aarthik dashaon ke kaaran uchit upachaar saadhaaran manushya kii samathrya ke baahar ho gaya he
 The power of medical science is now greatly increased and is continuously increasing

 Man's lifetime is longer
 din--prati--din naveen aushadhiyaan nikal rahi hai; rogon kaa kaaran gyaat ho rahaa he; unki chikitsa gyaat kii ja rahi he
 The government has three major health related functions

 The physician has a great place and responsibility in accomplishing these three objectives
