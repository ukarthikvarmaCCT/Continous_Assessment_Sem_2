 dilli darbar ke varsh 1911 main bharat kii rajdhani ko tatkaaleen kolkata se sthanantarit kar dilli laane kaa nirnay liya gaya
 The decision was announced by George v on 12 December
 is yojana ke tahat governor general ke awaas ko pradhan or ativ vishesh darja diya gaya
 The British architect Sir Edwin Landasier Lutyens, who was a key member of the town plan, was assigned the design of the building site
 iske mul yojana ke anusaar, kuch aisa bananaa tha, jo ki poorviy or paashchaatya style kaa mishran ho
 In the opinion of some people, this palace should have been in the traditional style, which would have been in the ancient Greek style
 lekin yah bharat main spashtatah paashchaatya shakti pradarshan hota, jo ki amaanya tha
 On the other hand, many people believed that it should be completely Indian style
 in donon ke mishran ke kai anupaat bhi prastaavit the
 The Viceroy then said that the palace would be traditional, but without the Indian motif
 yahi vah abhiklpana thi, jo ki moort rup main aaj khadi he
 This palace was built in the same form as the Lutyens sent Baker from Shimla on 14 June 1912
 lootyans kii abhiklpana vrahat rup se paramparaagat thi, jo ki bhartiya vaastukala se varnmel, byore, ityadi main atyadhik prerit thi, saath hi viceroy ke aadesh ke anusaar bhi thi
 Lutyens and Baker, who were assigned to the Viceroy's House and Secretariats, initially acted fairly cordially, but later also quarreled
 baker ko is bhawan ke aage bane do sachivalayon kii yojana kaa kaary diya gaya tha
 According to the initial plan, the Viceroy House was to be built atop Raisina Hill and both secretariats were to be built below
 baad main sachivalayon ko 400 gaj peeche khiskaakar pahari par hi bananaa tay hua
 According to the plan of Lutyens, this building would have been situated at a lonely height, which had to be pushed back from its original plan due to the secretariats, as well as both the secretariats were standing ahead, so that it was lost in sight
 yahi unke vivaad kaa kaaran tha
 At the completion of this palace, the Lutyens had a good fight with Baker, as the Viceroy's house was, of course, obstructed by the high angle of the road
 lootyans ne is vivaad ko bakerlu ke str kaa mana
 But despite a lot of effort, it could not be changed
 vah chahta tha, ki bhawan se neeche tak ek lambi dhaal par sadak aaye, jisase ki bhawan kaa drishy naa baadhit ho, evam dur se bhi drishy ho
 In 1914, a committee consisting of Baker and Lutyens decided that the road slope should be 1 in 25, which later became 1 in 22 only
 isse adhik khadi dhaal bhawan ke dashya ko or baadhit karti
 Lutyens knew that even this gradient would not be fully visible
 tab usne ise kam karaane kaa nivedan kiya
 In 1916, the Imperial Delhi Committee rejected this proposal of Lutyens
 lootyans ne tab bhi yahi samajha ki baker sarkaar ko khush karke or paise banane main adhik laga tha, naa ki acchhee shrenee kii vaastu roopankan main dhyaan kedrit karne main
 Lutyens traveled to India and England almost twenty two years each year to build Viceroy buildings in both places

 Its height in the 1913 building plan was increased by Lord Hardinge
 is gumbad main paramparaagat or bhartiya shaileyon kaa mishran he
 According to Lutyens, the form has emerged from the Pantheon of Rome, but it is also possible that it was built on the inspiration of the Sanchi Stupa
 is gumbad ghere hue ek dwaar mandap bana hua he, jisamen samaan sthit stambh hai, jo ki gumbad ko uthaae hue hai or in stambhon ke bich khaali sthaan he
 It is in all directions on each side of the dome
 is ke kaaran hi, yah gumbad kisi bhi kone se dekhne par, yadi garmi ke dhundhale mausam main dekhen, to tairta hua prathit hota he
 The dome built of reinforced concrete cement of the outer dome began to take its shape around 1929
 is gumbad kaa antim pashaan 6 april 1929 ko lagaaya gaya tha
 Although the copper cover was not installed on it till 1930
 bhawan ke thik saamne se ek maarg naarangi badarpur bajri se dhanka hua sidhaa lohe ke mukhya dwaar rupi phatak tak jaataa he, jo ki us phatak se hota hua, dono sachivalayon, north block or south block ke bich se ho kar laal deevaaron ke bich se neeche utarataa he or vijay chowk se hota hua, rajpath kehalaata he
 This route leads to India Gate

 The Mughal Garden was conceived by Lady Harding
 unhone srinagar main nishat or shalimaar baag dekhe the, jo unhen bahut bhaaye

 Bad breath can cause anxiety in the affected person
 yah ek gambhir samasya ban sakati he kintu kuch saadhaaran upayon se saans kii durgandh ko roka ja saktaa he
 Bad breath is caused by bacteria that originate in the mouth and cause bad odor
 niyamit rup se brush nahin karne se munh or daanton ke bich fansaa bhojan bacteria paidaa karata he
 Sulfur, excreted by these bacteria, causes a bad odor in your breath
 lahasun or pyaaj jaise kuch khaadya padaarthaan main tikhe tel hote hai
 They cause bad breath, because these oils go into your lungs and come out of the mouth
 saans kii durgandh kaa ek anya pramukh kaaran dhumrapaan he
 Many beliefs about overcoming bad breath are prevalent
 munh saaf karne se saans kii durgandh keval asthaayee rup se dur hoti he
 Look for an anti-septic cleanse that kills germs that cause odor, reduce tooth decay and is recognized by the Indian Dental Association
 sach yah he ki adhikansh log keval 30 se 45 second tak hi daanton ko brush karte hai, jo samuchit nahin he
 To properly clean all the surfaces of teeth, you should brush twice a day for at least two minutes
 jeebh kii safai bhi karnaa yaad rakhen, kyonki bacteria ko vahaan rahanaa pasand he
 Rinse is equally important, because brushing alone will not remove harmful rot and food fragments stuck between your teeth and gums
 yadi saans kii durgandh kii chintaa he, to munh or daanton kii dekhbhaal kaa dhyaan rakhen
 Some sugar-free gum and mint may also temporarily remove odor
 yadi sahi tareeke se brush or kulla karte hai or niyamit safai ke liye daanton ke doctor se paas jate hai, lekin aapaki sanson main durgandh barkaraar he, to koi chikitsakeey samasya, jaise sincitis yaa masoodon kii beemaari ho sakati he
 If any problem is suspected, consult your doctor or dentist
 ve tay kar sakate hai ki aapaki sanson kii durgandh ke peeche kya kaaran he or use dur karne main aapaki madad kar sakate hai
 Most of the breath smells from your mouth
 sanson kii durgandh ke kai kaaran hote hai
 Some of the reasons are as follows: transformar, switch mod power supplai, vidyut motor, prakaash balb aadi vidyut upkaran chaalu karte hi jo dhara lete hai vah unke dwaara saamaanya avasthaa main lee jane vaali dhara se bahut adhik ho sakati he
 This excessive current is called inflow current
 yah dhara kuch milisecond se lekar kuch second tak bahati he jo alag alag lod ke liye alag alag hoti he
 Various measures are taken to stop this current
 iske alaava fus or paripath vichedak is prakaar kii reating ke chune jate hai taaki unase hokar kuch der bahut adhik dhara bhi bahe to bhi ve trip na hon
 The reason for the origin of the inflow current in different devices also varies
 udhaaharan ke liye prakaash balb main antarvaah dhara kaa kaaran kam taap par philament kaa pratirodh atyant kam hona he
 When the transformer is turned on, the core becomes saturated for some time due to which much current flows
 transformar kii antarvaah dhara is baat par bhi nirbhar karti he ki chaalu karte samay asi voltage kis phej main tha
 In SMPS, often due to the rapid charge of capacitors, it causes the origin of the inward current
 disi motaron ko chaalu karte hi bahut adhik dhara bahati he jo inamen is samay 'back iemef' kii anupasthiti ke kaaran hota he
 Due to the saturation of the transformer, the current flowing through it is very high in DC and second harmonic
 is atishay dhara ke kaaran fus ud sakate hai yaa anya suraksha-riley paripath ko tod sakate hai 
 Apart from this, mechanical disturbances can also occur in the coil of the transformer due to the inflow current
