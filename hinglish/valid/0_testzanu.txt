 Brahma requested protection from Mahamaya
 With the inspiration of Mahamaya, Vishnu Yoginindra renounced and killed the demons

 No one can be punished for an offense if he has not directly or indirectly done any work which is invalid by law or has not committed error in any mandatory work prescribed by law
 saadhaarant: kisi aparaadh kii purnataa ke liye yah aavashyak he ki vah 'doshapurn man' yaa 'aapraadhik manahosthiti' se kiya jaay
 But only if the offender is voluntary can his work be considered a crime
 swechha se kiya hua kaam yaa kaam kii avhelnaa vah he, jise karne yaa na karne kii ichha rahi ho
 Therefore, if a person has committed a crime in an unconscious state - that is, when sleepy, from a very low state, due to inertia or insanity - then it would be presumed that his brain was not functioning in such a situation
 falat: us kaam ke karne yaa uski avhelnaa main uski ichha nahin thi
 Similarly, if a person commits a crime on being extremely bound, then there will be a lack of voluntary work in it
 koi kaam yaa isamen chyuti ichhapurna maani jaayegi, yadi kaaryakari upyukt saavdhaanee baratane par use nahin karata yaa uski avhelnaa se virat hota
 Do not consider any involuntary work or error of work voluntary
 at: yadi yah pramanit ho ki upyukt saavdhaanee baratane par bhi aisa kaam nahin ruk sakaa to yah dandaneey nahin ho saktaa
 Sometimes the desire to do something forbidden by law is considered to be a defective mind
 simit varg ke aparaadhon main doshapurn man aavashyak nahin he
 For illustration, if a person marries another with his wife, he cannot say in his defense that he believed with a pure heart that his first marriage has been severed
 is varg main kanoon dwaara nirdisht chote chote aparaadh hi aate hai
 In order to know whether a defective mind is necessary in such crimes, it becomes necessary to look towards the objective of the specified law
 jis aparaadh main vishesh ichha yaa maansik sthiti aavashyak he, uske liye koi vyakti apradhi nahin hoga, yadi uskaa man doshapurn nahin tha evam duusare vyakti ke aadesh se usne vah aparaadh kiya tha
 But the person whose order caused the crime, will be liable
 saadhaarant: koi vyakti kisi kaam yaa uski avhelnaa ke liye uttaradaayi nahin hoga, yadi usne swayan aparaadh nahin kiya he yaa nirdhaarit kaam karne se virat nahin hua he yaa kisi duusare vyakti ko aparaadh karne ke liye adhikaar nahin diya he or na use nirdhaarit kaam karne se virat hone kii prerana di he
 No owner can be punished for the malice, fraud or neglect of his servant or agent, because the mental state of the servant or agent cannot be called the mental state of the owner
 kintu simit varg ke kuch maamalon main jahaan maansik sthiti aparaadh ke liye aavashyak nahin he, apane sevak yaa agent ke saamaanya kaary ke dauraan main kiye gaye kaamon ke liye maalik uttaradaayi hoga, bhale hi use aise kaam kii jaankaree na rahi ho or ve kaam uske aadesh ke viruddh hi kyon na kiye gaye hon
 a corporation can work only through its servant or agent
 at: inke kaam yaa kanoon dwaara nirdisht kaam main truti ke kaaran nigam hi uttaradaayi ho saktaa he
 But the corporation shall not be liable for treason, gurudra crime, and minor offenses, which may be punished personally by violence or for crimes in which imprisonment or physical torture can be punished
 apane sevak yaa agent ke aparaadh ke liye use keval arthdand diya ja saktaa he

 The use of the informants thus created sometimes becomes so much that the use of the root word is almost completely stopped and the index takes the form of that root word as part of the written language
 iskaa ek saral udhaaharan "unesco" he jo vastut: "united neshans ageucational, scientific and cultural argenijeshan" is lambey naam main prayukt paanch mukhya shabdon ke pratham aksharon ke mail se bana he
 Similarly, "mister" is a widely used word in English, which is rarely written as a whole
 jab kabhi kisi bhi prasang main ukt shabd likhnaa hota he to puraa shabd na likhakar keval uske suchakakshar Mr
 se hi kaam chalaa liya jaataa he
 The feminine form of the word "mrs
" or "mistress" is also never written in its entire form and only the letter Mrs
 It is written as praani maatr kaa swabhaav he ki vah kathin evam adhik samay vaale kaary kii apeksha saral or kam samay vaale kaary ko adhik pasand karata he
 The bulletin can also be said to be the gift of this innate natural nature of man
 vidwaanon tathaa bhashaa visheshgyon kaa mat he ki suchakaksharon kii pratha aadi kaal se chali aa rahi he
 Ancient examples of Suraksaras can be easily seen in coins and inscriptions of ancient times, while short forms or inscriptions were also used to save space on coins and inscriptions and to save the labor of writing on inscriptions
 aadhunik kaal main bhi vividh deshon ke sikkon par suchakakshar dekhe jate hai
 Numerous examples of informants are also found in ancient writings
 pracheen lekhashastra main shabdon ko sankshipt rup main likhane yaa mul shabdon ke sthaan par suchakaksharon kaa prayog karne ke do mukhya kaaran batalaaye jate hai - Willingness to save the labor of writing big or angry words or words used repeatedly in the same context in full form
 aisi sthiti main mul shabd yaa shabdon ke sthaan par suchakaksharon kaa prayog tabhi kiya jaataa tha jab unka arth usee prakaar aasaani se samaj main aa jaae jis prakaar mul shabd likhe jane par, The desire to save writing space, ie the desire to write more and more in a limited space
 yadi koi lekhak kisi vaigyanik yaa pravidhik vishay kii pustak yaa lekh main kisi clisht yaa bade shabd ke liye kisi saral suchakakshar kaa prayog karata he to praaia: dekha jaataa he ki uske dwaara prayukt suchakakshar usee vishyakshetra se sambandhit anya lekhak tathaa vidvan bhi sheeghra hi apana lete hai
 It is often seen in legal documents, public and private papers, and many other types of papers used in day-to-day use, that frequent and voluminous letters of repeated use are in circulation
 ye suchakakshar pehle to kisi vyakti vishesh dwaara keval apane nijee upyog ke liye hi nirmit kiye jate hai, par baad main inhen suvidhajanak jaanakar dhire-dhire anya log bhi inkaa prayog karne lagate hai
 The simplest form of signifiers is one in which a letter is used for a word or at most two or three letters
 pracheen yunaan ke sikkon main shaharon ke puure naam ke sthaan par unke naam ke keval pratham do yaa teen akshar hi milte hai
 Similarly, in ancient inscriptions, names of cities as well as some other large and inscribed words are also found
 pracheen rome main sarkari ohade, padavi yaa oopaadhiyon kaa aashay keval unke prathamakshar se hi samaj liya jaataa tha
 When the signatures are used continuously for some time, then after some time they become part of the written language
 pracheen unani sahitya main aise anek suchakakshar milte hai jo aadhunik unani bhashaa main bhi thik usee rup or arth main prachlit hai jis rup or arth main ve aaj se saikadon varsh purv prachlit the
 Even in the present day, we use many such informers in the spoken and written language of daily life, now we have become part of the language and whose complete form is known to very few people
 is prakaar ke suchakakshar shaayad hi kabhi mul shabd ke rup main likhe yaa bole jate hai
 NATO, CITO, Santo, Gestapo, CID, V
P
 Etc
 are some similar indices
 pracheen misr se sambandhit jo saamagree prapya he tathaa jo kahiraa ke museum tathaa british museum, main surakshit hai, use dekhne se pataa chalata he ki pracheen unani or latin bhashaaon main bhi suchakaksharon kaa prayog hota tha
 The method of making indices in the ancient Greek language was very simple
 yaa to mul shabd kaa pratham akshar likhakar uske aage do aadi lakeeren khinchakar suchakakshar banaae jate the yaa mul shabd ke jitne ansh ko chhodana hota tha uskaa pratham akshar mul shabd ke praarambhik ansh se kuch upar likhakar suchakakshar kaa bodh karaayaa jaataa tha
 Sometimes two letters were thus written above the initial fraction
 arestu likhit athens ke samvidhan sambandhi jo hastlikhit granth prapya hai tathaa jo pehali shatabdi ke lipikon dwaara likhe maane jate hai, unamem bhi suchakaksharon kaa prayog miltaa he
 In these texts, a regular method of building signatures of the carver and some other words is found
 british museum main "elliod" kii chhathi shatabdi kii jo pratiyaan surakshit hai, unamem bhi suchakaksharon kaa prayog miltaa he
 In these copies, the words for which the indicators are used, have a sign corresponding to the English letter in front of their first letter, indicating that these words are written in shortened form
 bible main bhi santon ke naamon ke liye praaia: suchakaksharon kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 In the Latin language, the practice of writing the first letter of big words in the form of an index is found in abundance
 is vidhi se praaia: sangya, naam, padavi, oopaadhi, tathaa ucch pratishthit lekhakon kii kritiyon aane vaale saamaanya shabdon ko bhi sankshipt kiya gaya he
 According to this practice, after writing the first letter of the original word, a point was placed next to it and the signature was made
 lekin is vithi kaa prayog keval ek nishchit seemaa tak hi kiya ja saktaa he kyonki ek hi akshar se prarambh hone vaale anek shabd hote hai
 The index should be such that it does not confuse any word other than a certain word in a certain context
 shaayad is kaaran latin bhashaa main suchakaksharon ke liye mul shabd ke pratham akshar ke saath-saath uske aage kuch vishesh sanketachihn kaa prayog bhi miltaa he
 Before the invention of printing art, signifiers were used more in writing
 yahan tak ki kabhi-kabhi ek hi vaakya main 4-5 suchakaksharon kaa prayog bhi ek hi saath hota tha jisase aksar bada bhram ho jaataa tha
 Looking at the speed with which the use of informers has increased in the modern era, this era can be called the era of informants as well
 suchakaksharon kii sankhya itani adhik ho gai he ki angreji bhashaa main inke kai chote bade sangrah tak prakashit ho chuke hai
 As previously stated, most indexes are created for a specific purpose or area
 jab yah khaas uddeshy puraa ho chuktaa he yaa us kshetra kaa kaary samaapt ho jaataa he to ve suchakakshar bhi kramash: lupt hote jate hai
 Finally there comes a time when they do not even exist
 gat mahayuddh kaal main europe tathaa america ke anek sarkari vibhaagon tathaa sainik kaaryon ke liye vividh suchakaksharon kaa prayog kiya jane laga tha
 After the wartime, when these government offices and departments were closed due to becoming unnecessary or the work of those departments ceased, the informers used for them were also of no use
 falat: us samay ke adhikansh suchakakshar aaj agyaat ho gaye hai
 The use of informers in the English language was started from the 14th century
 14veen sadi main prachlit prasiddh suchakakshar ke udhaaharan ke rup main ham "cam" shabd ko le sakate hai jo carmellites, augustinions, jecobiyans or minaritiz ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha, tathaa jo inhen shabdon ke pratham aksharon ko milakar bana he
 The parliament called "keball" is famous in the history of England in the 17th century
 yah naam us samay kii sarkaar ke paanch mantriyon clifford, arlington, barchingham, ashali or laderdel ke pratham aksharon ko milakar banaaya gaya tha
 After 1930, the practice of making such names spread rapidly in America
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki gyaan-vigyaan ke praaia: sabhi aadhunik vishyon main to suchakakshar prachlit ho hi gaye, amareeki sarkaar ke praaia: prayek karyaalay, vibhaag, upavibhag tak ke liye suchakaksharon kaa prayog kiya jane laga
 Moreover, by now this practice has spread so much that almost every small big company, university, college, institution, establishment etc
 of America are more well known by the name of the name than the full name
 is sambandh main yah bhi ek manoranjak tathy hi kaha janaa chahie ki jis desh ko aadhunik yug main suchakaksharon kii vruddhi karne kaa adhikansh shrey he, uskaa naam bhi angreji main puraa na likhaa jaakar suchakakshar ke rup main hi likhaa jaataa he
 Similarly, NY is also written for its capital New York
 america main log 'kalege ov di city ov neuyark' ko si

en
vaai

 In India too, now the Banaras Hindu University is BHU more than its full name in the educated community
 Is more well known by the name of
 america or europe ke deshon main to ab yah ek pratha si ban gai he ki kisi bhi company, sanstha, agency aadi pratishthan yaa prakaashan aadi kaa namakaran karte samay is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki uske naam main prayukt shabdon ke aksharon se koi saral, suvidhajanak suchakakshar banaaya ja sake
 "eskap", "lulop", etc
 are examples of similar figures
 alag-alag vishyon ke suchakakshar bhi alag-alag prakaar ke hai
 When western music has to be written, some specific indicators are used for it
 chikitsajaagat main prachlit "tii

" shabd se to ab saamaanya janparichit hai
 This is really the index
 ganit shaastra main kuch pratik suchakaksharon kaa kaary karte hai
 It is not necessary to introduce the symbols of -, +, ̧, =, \ , etc
 to the readers
 ye bhi ek prakaar ke suchakakshar hi hai
 The work of subjects like astronomy, astrology, mathematics, medicine, chemistry and musicology, etc
, cannot be run without informants
 rasayanashastra main vividh rasinic tatwon ke naam ke liye suchakaksharon kaa prayog hota he
 These bulletins are usually the first letters of the original English words
 jab do tatwon kaa naam ek hi akshar se prarambh hota he to unke suchakaksharon main pratham do aksharon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For some elements, especially elements that have been known since ancient times, the first letters of Latin names are also used
 udhaahrant: loha kaa suchakakshar Fe he jo vastut: latin ke 'ferrum ' shabd se bana he
 For more information on how such a use is done, more information can be found in an English encyclopedia under the term "chemistry"
 vartmaan kaal main suchakaksharon kii jo vruddhi hui he, uskaa bahut kuch shrey samachaarpatron ko bhi diya ja saktaa he
 One of the main principles of newspapers is that in the least space, more and more news should be given in abstract form
 suchakaksharon kii sahaayta se hi samachar is uddeshy main safal ho pate hai
 At present, the unofficial names which have become popular for the names of many political parties and institutions are in fact the result of newspapers
 nato, sito or prasopa jaise naamon kii kalpana bhi kabhi inke sansthaapakon ne na kii hogi, par samachaarpatron ne apni suvidha ke liye "north atlantic treety argenigeshan" ke liye "nato" or praja socialist party ke liye "prasopa", bhartiya janata party ke liye 'bhaajapa' jaise saral or sahajagrahya suchakaksharon kaa prayog karnaa shuru kar liya
 Newspapers also make names of political leaders
 rus ke pradhanmantri shri nikita es crushchev ke liye keval "ke" or britain ke pradhanmantri shri herold macmillan ke liye keval "mike" likhakar hi kaam chalaa liya jaataa tha
 Hindi letters for the President of the United States of America Mr
 Eisenhower were also using the word Ike only
 aadhunik yug main suchakaksharon kii jo apratyaashit vruddhi hui he use dekhte hue ham unhen saadhaaran bhashaa ke antargat prayog kii jane vaali pravidhik bhashaa kah sakate hai
 In the subject of mathematics and chemistry, the indices in which it is used are equally known in all countries, this can be said specifically
 in vishyon ke suchakakshar rashtriyata, dharm, varna aadi kaa bandhan todakar har jagah samaan rup se prayukt hote hai
 Degrees and courses in the academic world are often known from informants

 aadhunik jivan main suchakaksharon ne itnaa adhik sthaan bana liya he ki unke arth ko jaananaa ab dainik jivan main safalataa praapt karne ke liye aavashyak samajha jane laga he
 thumbnail suchakakshar banane ke koi nishchit niyam nahin hai
 So many inscriptions can be created for a single word or name that sometimes multiple indices for the same word become prevalent

 Arthur Llewellyn Basham was a famous historian, Indologist and author of many books
 1950 or 1960 ke dashak main 'skool of oriental and african studies' ke professor ke rup main unhone anekon bhartiya itihaaskaaron ko padhaayaa, jinamein aar es sharma, romila thapar tathaa ve es pathak pramukh hai
 Basham, born and raised in England, is known for his extremely popular and classical work The Wonder That Was India: a Survey of Culture of Indian Subcontinent before the Coming of the Muslims, written primarily on the culture of ancient India
 itihaas-lekhan main vastunishthata ke pairokaar basham ne kisi aitihaasik nirnay par pahunchne ke purv itihaaskaar ke liye aavashyak drushti par prakaash daalate hue apane ek lekh main sujhaayaa he ki apni abhidharana siddh karne ke liye itihaaskaar ko bade paimaane par sroton kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 But at the same time, he should also avoid the role of a barrister whose only purpose is to decide in his favor
 basham har aisi baat par bal dene ke paksh main nahin the jo itihaaskaar ke tark ko majboot banaati ho yaa sarvaadhik sakaaratmak alok main isaki vyakhya karti ho
 Nor did they try to circumvent all the evidence from the other side
 vastutah, basham is manyata main vishwaas rakhte the ki itihaaskaar kii drushti barrister kii nahin jaj kii tarah honi chahie, ek aise jaj kii jo apana nirnay sunaane se pehle sabhi pakshon ko nazar main rakhte hue bina kisi pakshpaat ke ek vastunishth nishkarsh par pahunchataa he
 Basham was born on May 24, 1914, in England, at a place called Lawton, Essex, in Wales Stoke
 peshey se patrkaar unke pita edward arthur abraham basham pratham vishwayuddh ke dauraan bhartiya sena main walantier ke taur par shimla ke nikat kasauli main rah chuke the
 Perhaps Basham became interested in Indian culture after listening to the stories he narrated
 andglakan isiyat main gahari aasthaa rakhane vaali basham kii maan mariya jine thampsan bhi patrkaar thim or laghu kathaayen likhti thim
 He had a deep attachment to language and literature
 sambhavtah in donon hi gunon ne basham ke vyaktitv or krititv main vistaar paaya
 This example can be seen in the excellent translation of Sanskrit, Pali and Tamil quotes by Basham and his affection for different languages and poems
 basham pehali pustak "history and doctorince of da aajeevkaz : a vainishd indian religen", unke shodh-prabandh kaa hi pustakeekaran tha
 This was the first research conducted on Ajivikas and is equally relevant today
 isamen basham ne baudhon or brahmanvaadi rachanaaon ke anveshan dwaara aajeevikon ke bare main strot jamaa kiye
 Their problem was that till then no texts were available to tell the history of Ajivika sect
 aajeevik bhautikwaad ke prachaarak hone ke saath-saath baudhon or brahmanvaadiyon ke pratidwandvi bhi the
 The rival sect had to carefully prepare and analyze such sources between Buddhists and Brahmins on the basis of which the creation of the history of Ajivikas was possible
 basham ke is anusandhan ke kaaran hi aajeevakon ko pracheen bharat ke itihaas main uchit sthaan mil sakaa
 Basham's second book, "the Wonder That Was India", established him internationally as an Indian scientist with a reputation as William Jones and Max Müller
 isi pustak ke kaaran unki chhavi aaj bhi bhartiya bauddhik maanas main ankit he
 This book, written mainly for the western readership, is counted by R

 The multi-volume "history and Culture of Indian People" is composed by Majumdar
 isse pehle aupniveshik itihaaskaaron kaa tark yah tha ki apane sampoorn itihaas main bharat sabase adhik samrudh or santusht angrejon ke shasankaal main hi rahaa
 Basham and Majumdar are credited with de-colonizing the ancient history of India in their own way, dismantling the negative stereotypes produced by James Mill, Thomas Macaulay and Vincent Smith
 das adhyyon main banti yah rachana mukhyatah bharat sambandhi paanch vishay-vastuon ko sambodhit he : itihaas or prak-itihaas, rajya-saamaajik vyavastha-dainandin jivan, dharm, kala or bhashaa va sahitya
 Basham directed more than a hundred phds in his academic career
 ye vidwaan aage chal kar vishwa ke vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon main academik padon par asin hue
 These include historians of ancient India such as Sharma, Romila Thapar
 marxvaadi itihaas-lekhan parampara ke in do pramukh pairokaron kaa guru hone ke baavjood basham swayan is parampara ke samarthak nahin the
 He considered Marxist interpretations of Indian history to be inadequate, in particular he objected to overestimating the materialist vision
 basham sampaadan aayi "a history of india" ek aisi rachana thi jisane garret kii rachana "ligesi of india" kaa sthaan le liya
 In 1960, Basham edited the papers presented at the conference organized on the chronology of the Kushans and published them in book form called "papers on the Date of Kanishka"
 is sampadit kriti main pracheen bhartiya rajya-vyavastha, dharm, sahitya, kala or chikitsa vigyaan par bhi sankshipt tippaniyan shaamil hai
 Under the aegis of the 'american Council of Learned Societies', Basham, during 1984-85, gave lectures by Universities on 'formation of Classical Hinduism' to Kenneth G
 Edited together with Jisk who published as "the End of Hinduism"
 basham ko antarrashtiya str par kai puraskaron or padaviyon se sammanit kiya gaya
