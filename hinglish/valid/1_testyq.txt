 a constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established norms that govern a state or other organization
 vah kisi sanstha ko prachaalit karne ke liye banaaya hua samhita he
 It is often in written form
 yah vah vidhi he jo kisi raashtra ke shashan kaa aadhaar he; uske charitra, sanghathan, ko nirdhaarit karti he tathaa uske prayog vidhi ko bataati he, yah raashtra kii param vidhi he tathaa vishesh vaidhanik sthiti kaa upbhog karti hasabhi prachlit kanoonon ko anivaary rup se samvidhan kii bhaavana ke anuroop hona chahie yadi ve iskaa ulanghan karenge to ve asanvaidhanik ghoshit kar die jate he
 The Constitution of India is the longest written constitution of any sovereign country in the world, with 146,385 words in its English-speaking version, 444 articles in 22 parts, 12 schedules and 101 amendments, while the Constitution of Monaco is the shortest written constitution
 Is 10 chapters with 97 paragraphs, and a total of 3,814 words
 samvidhan shabd kaa prayog saadharantaya sankuchit evam vistrut do roopon main hota he
 In broad terms, it is used for all the rules related to the governance of a state
 in niyamon main se kuch niyam nyaayalayon dwaara maanya tathaa lagu kiye jate hai, kintu kuch aise bhi hote hai jo purnataya vaidhanik nahin hote
 Beyond these laws, semi-constitutional rules originate from stereotypes, traditional practices, prevailing practices and legal interpretation
 apane ashuddh rup ke kaaran yah niyam nyaayalayon main manyata nahin pate, kintu phir bhi shashanprabandh kii vyaavhaarikta main inkaa prabhaav shuddh niyamon kaa mishran hi samvidhan hota he
 The legislation of England bears witness to this statement
 anya deshon main samvidhan kaa arth tanik adhik sankuchit rup main hota he, tathaa keval jan vishesh niyamon ke sambandh main hota he jo shashan prabandh ke hetu aadhikarik lekhapatron main aabaddh kar liye jate hai
 As a result, the constitution is one or more documents of a country in which the basic rules of discipline are compiled in the governance of that country
 is arth ke sakshi sanyukt raashtra america tathaa bharat ke samvidhan hai
 The word 'constitution' should be considered whatever, but the basic thing is that a complete study of the constitution of a country is not possible only by observing some written rules
 kaaran, yah to shashan prabandh sambandhi anushaasan kaa ek ansh maatr hote hai
 The complete constitutional introduction can only be possible from the study of all the administrative organs
 udaahranarth, bahudhaa samvidhan sanvida main keval shashan ke mukhya angon - karypalika, vidhaayini sabha, nyaaypalika - kaa hi ullekh hota he
 But the interpretation of the composition of these institutions, the manner of appointment of office bearers etc
 is decided by simple method
 isi prakaar kai deshon main nirvachan niyam, nirvachan kshetra evam prati kshetra ke sadasyon kii sankhya, shaskeey vibhaagon kii rachana tathaa nyaaypalika kaa sanghathan, in sab mahatvapurn kaaryo ko samvidhan main kahin vyakhya nahin hoti; yadi hoti bhi he to bahut saadhaaran rup main, mukhyat: inkaa varnan tathaa niyantran saadhaaran vidhi dwaara hi hota he
 Apart from this, the entire legislature is not confined within the domain of the Legislature, the rules that emerge from the judiciary's interpretation of the statute bring a continual revisionism in the constitution
 phir, rajyaprabandh sambandhi roodhi evam vyavhaar bhi kam prabhavatmak or mahatvapurn nahin hote
 Therefore, only the study of all these parts can complete a comprehensive legal introduction
 kintu 'sanvaidhanik shaastra' shabd kii paridhi main keval shuddh vaidhanik niyam hi aate hai, anya sab sanvaidhanik vyavahaarroop maane jate hai
 There are two types of constitution: written and unwritten
 likhit samvidhan adhiktar ek lekhya yaa kuch sankalit lekhya hote hai
 But the interpretation of the form in which the constitution is implemented is neither completely written nor completely written
 england kaa samvidhan alikhit mana jaataa he kintu vahaan bhi 1701 i
 main act ov setelment, kai repragentation ov pipulj act, 1911 evam 1949 ke parliment act jinke dwaara lard sabha ke adhikaar simit hue, 1679, 1816 evam 1862 ke hebius carpus act tathaa 1947 i
 main crown procedings act nirmit hue
 The importance of these written rules in the Constitution of England is no less than unwritten stereotypes, traditions and practices
 iske vipareet bharat ke vistrut rup se likhit samvidhan main bhi kuch alikhit niyam poorak rup main milte hai, jaise vidhansabhaon evam sadasyon ke visheshadhikaar, raashtrapati tathaa rajyapal kaa mantriparishad se sambandh, sanvaidhanik sankatavastha evam rajyapal kii sthiti, in samast vishyon ke sambandh main samvidhan ke atirikt alikhit niyam hi lagu hote hai
 Other distinctions related to the constitution are - salubrious and landscape, often they are also used as synonyms of unwritten and written respectively
 lard brice ne likhit ke sthaan par paridrid tathaa alikhit ke sthaan par namansheel shabdon kaa prayog sahaj bhav se kiya he
 But this type of mixed use is not appropriate
 vastutah: samvidhan likhit kintu namsheel ho saktaa he or alikhit kintu paridrudh rup kaa ho saktaa he
 In principle, the Parliament of England can only make nominated changes to the constitution of England, and the Prime Minister there may invite ministerial rule by not inviting the Cabinet, but such sudden changes are never functional in practice
 yadi england ke itihaas kii ore drushtipaat kiya jaae to prathit hoga ki parivartan sadaa kramik vikaas ke rup main hue he; aakasmikta kii vahaan koi sambhaavna nahin
 Notwithstanding all these, rules relating to voting, independence reform, the abdication of the power of the Lord's House, and post-war dominion self-government, the constitution of England has changed little over the course of a century
 falat: england kaa samvidhan alikhit hokar bhi namansheel nahin paridrudh rup kaa he
 On the contrary, the Indian constitution is called a scenario, because its amendment process is very complex, where only a majority of the Central Parliament is not enough to amend any subject, but it is also necessary to get a majority of the legislatures of all the states
 aisi jatil vyavastha ke uparaant bhi pichley anek varsho main bhartiya samvidhan main anek sanshodhan ho chuke hai
 The reason for this is that amendment changes and amendments are concerned not only with the written system of amendment action but with the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of the major influential political bandits of the country
 yadi ve vaidhanik ruparekha or uske dwaara raajnneetik satta ke vitaran se santusht hoti hai to parivartan nahin hote, anyathaa sanshodhan, aavartan, parivartan avashyambhavi hai
 The reason for the constitutional amendments was the Congress governments under whose control the rule of the central and almost all the states
 atev kisi samvidhan kaa rup namansheel he athwa paridrudh, yah keval us desh kaa sanvaidhanik itihaas hi spasht kar saktaa he
 If changes have been made smoothly, then the constitution of that country is humble, otherwise a scenario
 sanyukt raashtra america ke udhaaharan ke uparaant adhiktar deshon main likhit samvidhan kii pratha prachlit ho gai he
 Written constitutions are created by the legislature elsewhere, such as the 'american Articles of Confederation' in the United States and the Austrian Hungarian Union in 1867 in Austria
 ichha na hote hue bhi kai samraaton evam raajaaon ne bhi unnisvin shatabdi main apane deshon main samvidhan rachana kii
 In France, in 1814 and 1830, and in 1848, in Sardinia, similarly the constituted constitutions were declared there
 anya samvidhan adhiktar desh kii vidhansabhaon dwaara hi bane, jaise 1787 i
 main america tathaa 1949 i
 main bharat main samvidhan kii rachana hui
 In most countries where written constitution is present, the constitution is given more recognition than other laws of the country
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki samvidhan kii utpatti hi is bhaavana se hui he ki shashanprabandh main nirankushta ko anushaasit tathaa simit rakhaa ja sake
 How much governance will be governed by the shackles of the constitution or how much will be governed by the shackles of the constitution, or how high the constitution will be considered, it depends on the purpose and attitude of the constitution makers in which subject they were willing to recognize and protect the constitution
 bhartiya samvidhan kii rachana ke samay nirmaataaon ke sammukh kai mul prashn the, jaise nagarikon ken mul swadhikaron kii suraksha, centre evam rajyon ke kaaryakshetra kii spasht vyakhya jisase donon apni nirdhaarit simaaon ke antargat hi vidhivyavahaar simit rakhen, samvidhan kaa rup paridrudh rakhana, tathaa rajyon main parsparik vaanijya vyavsaay, swatantry kii raksha ityadi
 The correctness and appropriateness of all the functions of the executive or legislature in the country depends on whether it is compatible with the constitutional objectives of the country or not, if any action is contrary to these basic objectives then that power is called external
 rajya ke sarvocch nyaayalay main jahaan vidhi prayukti evam vyakhya hoti he, adhikanshat: vahiin yah bhi nishchit hota he ki amuk vidhinium shaktibaahya he athwa nahin
 According to Hamilton, a leading author of the US Constitution, the constitution is indeed the original law and judges should always accept and accept this fact
 jab vidhanmandalon dwaara nirmit saadhaaran vidhiniyamon tathaa samvidhan main virodh upasthit ho to samvidhan ko ucch evam praathmik maanakar adhik manyata deni chahie
 The reason is that the constitution itself is an expression of the internal objectives of the people of the country while the other law symbolizes the feelings of the representatives of that people
 swabhaavat: samvidhan mul evam shreshth he
 In 1803, Chief Justice Marshall decided Margaro v
 Madison in accordance with this rule
 jahaan alikhit samvidhan hota he vahaan shashanprabandh par sanvaidhanik niyam kii abddhata avashya nahin hoti kintu janamat ke bhay se tathaa nirvachan-kriya, paramparaon evam roodhiyon dwaara is prakaar kaa niyantran evam anushaasan sahaj rup se hota rahata he

 Tetanus is an infectious disease in which nerve cells that control the skeletal muscle are affected

 It can remain like a termite by making long holes in the soil

 When these bacteria become active and grow rapidly and produce poison affecting the muscles, tetanus infection spreads
 tetanus bacteria puure vaataavaran main, aamtaur par mitti, dhul or jaanwaron ke mel main paaya jaataa he
 The path of entry of bacteria in our body is usually torn wounds, which are caused by rusted nails, metal fragments or insect bites, burns or skin bursts

 In the first half of the 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad started a campaign to build the temple of Hindu deity Rama in place of Babri structure in Ayodhya
 yahan masjid kaa nirmaan mogul badshaah babar ne karavaaya tha or isapar vivaad he ki pehle yahan mandir tha
 The basis of the movement was that this area is the birthplace of Ram and Babur demolished the temple for the purpose of building a mosque here
 bhaajapa ne is abhiyaan kaa samarthan armbh kar diya or ise apane chunavi abhiyaan kaa hissaa banaaya
 With the strength of the movement, the BJP won 86 seats in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections and significantly supported the Vishwanath Pratap Singh government of the like-minded National Front

 chini bhavchitra duniya kii sab se puraani chalati aa rahi likhane kii vidhi he
 Although there are tens of thousands of images in Chinese, but most of these are only seen in historical writings
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki saadhaaran chini main sakshar hone ke liye teen se chaar hazaar bhavchitron kaa jaananaa kaafii he
 Every Chinese phrase has an accent and a meaning attached to it, and most Chinese words are written with two expressions
 yah dhyaan rahe ki uccharan upbhasha or bhashaa ke saath badalata he
 It is not like the Devanagari script that a letter has the same pronunciation everywhere
 ise samajhane ke liye sochiye ki agar koi pahaad kaa chitra dekhe to vah sabko samaj aa jayega, lekin hindi bolne vaala us shabd ko 'parvat' kahegaa, farsi bolne vaala 'koh' kahegaa or angrezi bolne vaala 'mountain' kahegaa
 Chinese expressions often have two or three forms: samay ke saath-saath bahut saare bhavchitra prachlit ho chuke the or unamem se bahut likhane main bade pechide the, isliye japan or china kii sarkaron ne inamen kuch maanakeekaran or sarleekaran kiye hai
 With this, many words in the Chinese language have two forms - the traditional Chinese form and the simplified Chinese form
 bahut se shabdon ke japani or chini rup bhi milte-julate lekin zaraa bhinn hote hai
 There are several categories of Chinese charts: yah kabhi chitra hua karte the lekin likhaai main aasaani laane ke liye or maanakeekaran karne ke baad inaki shaklein thodi badal gai hai
 For example, व्यक्ति means 'person', 日 ie 'sun', 月 means 'moon' and 木 means 'tree'
 lagbhag 4% chini bhavchitra is shrenee ke hai
 In English, the words in this category are called 'pictogram'
 yah chitron main thodaa pher-badal kar ke unhen anya matlab dete hai
 For example, where 木 means 'tree', जोड़कर is formed by joining two trees, which means 'clump'
 agar teen vriksh jodakar 森 likhe, to iskaa arth 'jangal' hota he
 In the same way चाकू means 'knife' but by marking its edge, 刃 is made, ie 'edge'
 zaraa-zaraa se nishaan banane se nae arthon vaale shabd banaae gaye hai
 In English, the words in this category are called 'idiogram'
 inamen ek se adhik chitron yaa bhavchitron ko jodakar nae arthon vaale shabd banaae jate hai
 For example, combining 'sun' and 'i
e
' moon 'makes' light'
 yadi vyakti ko ped se joda jaae to 休 banataa he, jiskaa matlab he 'vishram' 
 Similarly, adding 女 and 子 makes 好, meaning 'good' is determined
 haalanki isapar kuch bhashavaigyanikon kaa vivaad he, isaki ek anya misaal 'chat' ke liye 宀 chihn ko 'stri' ke liye 女 chihn ke saath milakar 安 bananaa he, jiskaa arth 'shaanti' he 
 Even in modern times, such new expressions have been fabricated according to need
 platinum ek moolyawaan safed dhaatu hoti he, jiske liye bhavchitra 鉑 he, jo 'safed' or 'dhaatu' ko milakar bana he
 In the same way, combining 'meter' and 'thousand' was made - it started being used around the end of the nineteenth century
 angrezi main is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'idiogramic compoundj' kehete hai
 Sometimes it has happened that there was no sign for anything but if the word was pronounced by another word for which the image was, then that mark was used for both
 masalan, bahut chini bhashaaon main 'zee' shabd kaa arth 'naak' bhi tha or 'swayan' bhi tha
 The symbol for 'nose' was और and it also came to be used for 'self'
 vaqt ke saath is chihn kaa 'naak' arth to bhula diya gaya or aadhunik chini lipi main iskaa arth sirf 'swayan' rah gaya he
 The name of this category is derived from 'rebus' English
 chini lipi ke sab se adhik shabd is shrenee ke hote hai
 They contain one or more signs that describe the meaning of the word and a graphic that has nothing to do with the meaning but is a sign of something that is similar to the word
 is se shabd kaa uccharan or matlab donon pataa chal jate hai
 For example, 'river', 'lake', 'waterfall', 'very strong water stream, or flushed water' and 'slippery'
 gaur kijiye kii har chihn kii bai taraf teen choti lakeeren hai, jo 'nadi' ke chitra ko saral karke bana he
 This indicates that the word is related to 'water'
 shabd kaa dai taraf kaa hissaa sirf dhwani bataata he
 On the right side of 中 is,, which means 'beech' in Chinese and is pronounced 'zhong'
 dekha ja saktaa he ki 沖 kah rahaa he 'pani se sambandhit shabd, jiskaa uccharan jhong se miltaa he', yani 'chong'
 In English, the meaning that describes such expressions is called 'radical' and the words in this category are called 'phono-semantic Compounds'
 is shrenee ke bhavchitra sabase pehle shang rajvansh ke jamaane main viksit hue the or us samay ke khandhiron main mili haddiyon par kharonche hue mili hai
 Sometimes a word is formed from two expressions in which the meaning is applied to both images
 masalan china kaa ek sangeet vaadya he, 'biva' or ek fal he 'laukaat'
 Both of these shapes are seen
 biva ko 批把 likhaa jaataa tha, jisamen donon chihnon kii bai taraf ek upar-neeche jate haath kaa arth sanket he, yani upar-neeche haath chalaakar vaadya bajaanaa
 Now by changing the meaning of 'hand' in it, applying the radical of 'tree' became the symbol of इसमें
 is nae do chihnon vaale shabd kaa matlab 'laukaat kaa fal' tha
 The symbols of the Biwa instrument itself changed over time and are 琵琶 in modern Chinese
 bhashaaon main sajaateey shabd ve hote hai jo kabhi ek hi hua karte the lekin samay ke saath-saath inke swar alag ho gaye hai or kabhi-kabhi arth bhi badal gaye hai
 For example, the word 'husband' in Sanskrit and the word 'potent' in English originate from the same primitive indo-european language word, but over time both their pronunciation and meaning have varied
 chini bhashaa main bhi aisa hua he
 For example, 'cao' and 'lao' were once the same word, but over time, both their pronunciation and expressions have differed
 is shrenee ke bhavchitra chini lipi main kam hai or angrezi main is shrenee ko 'transformd cognats' bulaayaa jaataa he
