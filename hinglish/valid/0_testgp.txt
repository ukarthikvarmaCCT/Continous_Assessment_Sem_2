 In 1933, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and established a racist empire, in which Jews were labeled sub-human and were not considered part of the human race
 1939 main germany dwaara vishwa yuddh bhadakaane ke baad hitler ne yahudiyon ko jad se mitaane ke liye apane antim hal ko amal main laana shuru kiya
 His soldiers began to squeeze the Jews into certain areas

 Several answers have been offered to this question: religious, historical, philosophical, psychological, and Marxist
 lekin koi bhi ek jawaab kabhi santoshjanak nahin ho saktaa
 The historical answer goes like this - In the 1930s a large part of the German population agreed to live in a society that was based on hatred, the concept of ethnic superiority and violence
 ve jis vyavastha se bandhe the, uski kendriya dharna yah thi ki yahudee log har us cheez kii numaaindgi karte hai, jo germanon ke khilaaf he or isliye yahudiyon ko khatm kar diya janaa chahie
 This notion was also associated with a racialized view of the world, which considered the Germans to be part of the master race and the Jews of the anti race with destructive physical qualities

 1
 duusare samoohon ke prati apni nitiyon se alag naajiyon ne har yahudee ko maarane kaa bidaa uthaaya
 For this, they did not care about age, sex, faith or work
 unhone is makasad ko anjaam dene ke liye khaas taur par ek aadhunik naukarshahi kaa istemaal kiya

 Residents here played an important role in the uprising of 1857
 inamen mukhya krantikari the- choudhary jabardast khan evam choudhary ulfat khan
 Chaudhary tremendous Khan and Chaudhary Ulfat Khan along with their supporters were put to death because of their involvement in revolution against the British
 lekin unki shahadat ko hapur ke nivasee aaj bhi yaad karte hai
 The Martyr's Fair is organized every year since 1975 AD in Hapur to commemorate the revolutionaries who died in 1857
 jo 10 may se shuru hokar ek maah tak chalata he
 This type of fair associated with 1857 is not held anywhere else in the whole country
 choudhary jabardast khan kaa parivaar multah asoda gaanv kaa rahane vaala tha jo apni jameendaari hone ke kaaran baad main hapur ke muhalla bhanda pattee main rahane lage
 Chaudhary had seven brothers, including Zahir Khan, Samast Khan, Ulfat Khan, Amjad Khan, Groom Khan, and a sister
 malagarh ke nawab validaad khan tathaa choudhary jabardast khan ke madhya dostana sambandh the
 "the son of Nawab Walidad Khan was married to the only daughter of Nawab Muzaffarnagar
 baraat malagarh se mujffarnagar ke liye ravaanaa hui
 The procession was to pass through Hapur as it was on the way
 yahan aane par nawab validaad khan ne choudhary jabardast khan ko baraat kaa mukhiya banaakar bheja or swayan waapas laut gaye
 This incident confirms the friendly relationship between the two
 nawab mujffarnagar dwaara baraat tathaa choudhary jabardast khan kaa bhavy swaagat kiya gaya
 The procession stayed at Nawab Muzaffarnagar for more than two months, even the people who used to get the information of the procession are not allowed to return, due to which the number of the processions increased considerably
 nawab validaad ke sthaan par choudhary jabardast khan ne var ke pita kaa uttardatiytav nibhaayaa
 The Nawab was the only daughter of Muzaffarnagar, so the Nawab surrendered his entire property to his girl and son-in-law
 " Our guess is that Walidad Khan would not have been able to go to the son's wedding due to his involvement in some secret and very important work, and that this work would not have been scheduled in advance, but it would have suddenly taken place
 yadi is kaary vishesh kaa pehle se abhas bhi hota, to nawab validaad shah kii tithi peeche hataa sakate the
 Also, work will be of such great importance that at the time of marriage, they could neither postpone the marriage nor delay the work
 aakhir prashn uthta he ki yah kaary vastav main kya tha? hamaara mat he ki yah kaam or kuch na hokar 1857 kii kranti kaa prasphuton se purv isaki yojana athwa iske yojanakaaron se sampark sambandhit rahaa hoga
 The evidence group under the then circumstances reinforces the presumption that the time of marriage will be around the spring of 1857
 is par vichaar karne se sahaj hi anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Historians are unanimous that a sudden revolution erupted from Meerut on 10 May 1857
 atah aise main yah sakshyasangat na hoga ki iske prasphuton kaa validaad khan ko purv abhas ho
 Therefore, it can be easily arrived at the conclusion that the date of marriage must have been long before the 10th of May
 aisa maan lene par pita validaad khan ne apni putr kii shaadi main amuly samay nasht karne kii apeksha yah uchit samajha hoga ki yojanakaaron se sampark sthapit kar kranti main apni bhoomika nirvahan kiya jaye

 Chaudhary tremendous Khan was removed from the gallows and ordered to be fed on his water
 parantu jabardast khan ke virdohi nahin chaahate the ki use jinda choda jaye
 He prayed to the British officer that if Chaudhary tremendous Khan was left alive, he would not leave us alive
 kyonki unhone kranti ke dauraan choudhary jabardast khan ke viruddh britaniyon kii madad kii thi, atah unki vinati ko wilson ne sweekaar kar liya
 When tremendous Khan was drinking water, he shot at his temple
 choudhary jabardast khan desh ke liye shahid ho gayi

 With the grace of Mata Mahalakshmi, Maharaja Agrasen divided his kingdom into 18 republics to form a huge kingdom, which was called Agraya Republic or Agrodaya in his name
 
 Maharishi Garg pledged to perform 18 yajna to Maharaja Agrasen with 18 Ganadhipatis

 17 Yagyas were completed
 jis samay 18 wein yajna main jivit pashuon kii bali di ja rahi thi, maharaj agrasen ko us drishy ko dekhakar ghrinaa utpann ho gai
 He stopped the yagya in the middle and said that in future no person of my kingdom will offer animal sacrifice in the yajna, nor will he kill the animal, nor eat the meat and every person of the kingdom will protect the living beings
 is ghatana se prabhavit hokar unhone ahimsa dharm ko apana liya
 Here in the last and eighty-nine yajna, the sacrifice of animal sacrifice by Yajnacharyo was said to be mandatory, if not, the gotra would remain incomplete, it was said, but in the eighteenth yagna on the orders of Maharaja Agrasen, Nagendra Rishi was invited from Nangal gotra
 yah gotra pashubali naa hone ke kaaran aadha mana jaataa he, is prakaar agarwal samaaj me aaj bhi 18 nahi, saadhe satraa gotra prachlit he

 agrasen ji kii aarti, jo koi nar gaaye! kahat trilok vinay se sukh sanmpati paae
 
 jai shri! Maharaj divided his kingdom into 18 ganas and established 18 gotras in the name of 18 gurus
 har gotra alag hone ke baavjood ve sab ek hi parivaar ke ang bane rahe
 For this reason, Agroha was also able to make all round progress
 rajya ke unheen 18ganon se ek-ek pratinidhi lekar unhone loktantric rajya kii sthapana kii, jiskaa swaroop aaj hamen vartmaan loktantr pranali main bhi dikhaayi padataa he
 Following are the 18 tribes of Agrawalas - us samay yajna karnaa samruddhi, vaibhav or khushhaali kii nishaani mana jaataa tha
 Maharaj Agrasen performed many yagyas
 ek baar yajna main bali ke liye laae gayi ghode ko bahut baichaiyn or daraa hua paa unhen vichaar aayaa ki aisi samruddhi kaa kya phayda jo mook pashuon ke khun se sarabor ho
 At the same time, he put a stop to Pashu Bali, even in the absence of his ministers
 isiilie aaj bhi agravansh samaaj hinsa se dur hi rahata he
 His neighboring king was very envious of Maharaj Agrasen's splendor of the kingdom
 isliye ve baar-baar agroha par akraman karte rahete the
 Despite repeated mouthfuls, there was tension in the state due to them
 in yudhon ke kaaran agrasenji ke praja kii bhalaai ke kaamon main vighn padataa rahata tha
 People were also frightened and plagued by daily battles
 isi ke saath-saath ek baar agroha main bady bheeshan aag lagi
 He could not be controlled in any way
 us agnikand se hajaaron log begharbar ho gayi or jeevika kii talash main bharat ke vibhinn pradeshon main ja based
 But he did not leave his identity
 ve sab aaj bhi agarwal hi kahalwanaa pasand karte hai or usee 18 gotron se apni pahchaan banaae hue hai
 Even today they all follow the path directed by Maharaj Agrasen
 maharaja agrasen kii rajdhani agroha thi
 Discipline was followed in his rule
 janata nisthapurvak swatantraaa ke saath apane karttavya kaa nirvaah karti thi
 Maharaj Agrasen ruled for 108 years
 unhone jin jivan mulyon ko grahan kiya unamem parampara evam prayog kaa santulit saamanjasy dikhaai detaa he
 On the one hand, he accepted the Karmakshetra directed for the Kshatriya varna in Hindu scriptures and on the other hand set new ideals in the perspective of the country
 unke jivan ke mul rup se teen adarsh hai- loktantric shashan vyavastha, aarthik samarupata evam saamaajik samanta
 After attaining a certain age, on consultation with Kuladevi Mahalakshmi, he went into austerities by handing over the rule of the Agrarian Republic to his eldest son Vibhu
 apni jindagi ke antim samay main maharaj ne apane jyeshth putr vibhu ko sari jimmedaari saunp kar vanprastha ashram apana liya
 Even today in history Maharaj Agrasen is mentioned as the supremely virtuous, religious, tolerant, inspiring great man of socialism

 There are total twelve blocks or sections here: - dilli ke anya vyavsaayik sthal: In the mid-17th century, French mathematician René decart made it very powerful by using algebra in geometry
 usne pehle do katati hui rekhaayen leen, jinhen aksh kehete hai
 The distance measured in parallel to these lines of a point is determined by its number or two
 ye rekhaayen bindu ke nirdeshaank kehalaati hai
 With the help of these coordinates each geometric fact can be represented by an algebraic equation
 is jyamiti kaa kai dishaao main vikaas hua
 In the first case, a broader form of geometry emerged, such that the equation of an exponent represents a simple line
 isi prakaar do ghaat kaa sameekaran ek shankav pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equations of powers three, four and higher began to be studied and the properties of their corresponding curves became much simpler than before
 tal ke vakron tak hi nahin, avkaash ke vakron kaa bhi adhyayan sambhav ho gaya
 For this, the points of a point from a three-point plane are determined by its distance and represent each point along an equation in Y, R, L
 in samikarnon ke vivechan se talon ore vakron ke gunon kaa adhyayan saralata se hota he
 In the other direction, the solution of composition related questions and activities became very simple
 ye kriyaayein keval kuch samikarnon ke hal par hi nirbhar hai, jisamen bahut vyapak prashn saralata se hal ho jate hai; jaise yadi rekha kisi vakr = o ko katati he, to in donon samikarnon ke hal unke kataan binduon kaa sthaan nishchit karenge
 If the origin of these equations is real, the line cuts the curve
 yadi baraabar hai to rekha vakr ko sparsh karti he
 If imaginary, the line does not intersect the curve, but we can say that the line will always cut the curve at two points, whether the points are real or coincident, or imaginary
 isi prakaar se tathy bade vyapak rup main die ja sakate hai, jo saadhaaran jyamiti main sambhav nahin tha
 In the third direction, coordinate geometry broadened the dimension
 do sankhyaayein ya, r do vimitiyon main tathaa teen sankhyaayein teen vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karti hai
 Now, the question arose in front of mathematicians as to what the four numbers Y, R, L, and the five numbers Y, R, L, V, would represent
 ganitagyon ne to amoort rup se apane mastishk main badi aasaani se soch liya ki chaar sankhyaayein chaar vimitiyon main or paanch sankhyaayein paanch vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karengi
 In this way, he also thought well of the anomalies
 unhen isse koi matlab nahin ki parthiv jagat main uskaa koi udhaaharan he yaa nahin
 Einstein must have used this idea in his theory of relativity and clarified the idea of aversion
 ab is ucch vimiti ke vichaar kaa aprayukt ganit main kuch kathin samasyaon ko hal karne main upyog karte hai
 For example, the number of different particles in a moving fluid is represented by seven numbers
 ve hai k, kha, ga, uskaa praarambhik sthaan, tathaa teen veg, jo ya, r, l aksh ke samaantar hon, tathaa samay, yah saat vimiti kaa prashn samajhakar hal ho saktaa he
 In the fourth direction, coordinate geometry generalized numbers and imaginary numbers emerged
 kalpanik bindu tathaa kaalpanik vakr ityadi vichaaron ne jyamiti ko bahut mahatvashaalee bana diya, jisase vyapkikaran main or adhik sahaayta mili, jaise anant par do kaalpanik binduon se janevaala shaankab vrutt hota he, ityadi
 In addition, geometry was discussed with the help of different types of coordinates, such as quadratic coordinates, triangular coordinates, tangent coordinates, etc

 prayek padaarth teen avasthaayon main paaya jaataa he : thos drav gas | At different periods of matter, the speed of the molecules is different, the inter-particle distance varies and the inter-particle force also varies
 That is why physical properties also vary in different periods of matter
 For example, in the solid state of matter it has a fixed volume and a fixed shape, in the liquid state its volume is fixed but the shape is not fixed and in the gas state neither the volume nor the shape is fixed
 These properties are explained by the atomic theory
 thos ke gunon kii vyakhya thos ke anugati siddhant dwaara kii ja sakati he, jo nimna he - The molecules of a solid are dressed in a regular order
 Each molecule has a certain duration
 These molecules keep vibrating around their position, but do not leave their place
 That is why the volume and shape of the solid are fixed
 thos main antara-anuk duuri bahut kam hoti he | saamanytah yah antara-anuk duuri, drav ke apeksha kam hoti he | The solid has the highest attraction force between molecules
 Due to this force, the molecules remain in their place in the solid and are not free to move from one place to another, but instead of staying at their place, they move here and there
 thos ko garm karne par uske anuon kaa dolan aayam bad jaataa he jisase unke bich kii ausat duuri bad jaati he arthath thos kaa prasar ho jaataa he | ise thos kaa ushmiya prasar kehete hai | The position of the molecules in the fluid is not fixed, only they keep moving randomly in different directions from different moves within the fluid
 drav main antara-anuk duuri praaia thos se adhik hoti he, lekin gas kii apeksha kaaphi kam hoti he | The force of attraction is much higher than that of gas, but much less than that of solid
 On heating the fluid, the average distance between its molecules increases, which is called the thermal diffusion of the fluid
 a condition occurs when the fluid is heated too much, while the average energy of the molecules increases so much that they are free to go out of the surface of the fluid by crossing the mutual attraction force
 This is called evaporation of fluid
 kisi gas ke sabhi anu samaan, sudrudh tathaa ati-sookshm golakaar kan hote hai | inkaa aaytan, gas ke aaytan kii tulana main naganya hota he | The position of gas molecules is not fixed
 gas main antara-anuk duuri sabase adhik hoti he | The attraction force between molecules in gases is often negligible
 That is why the movement of molecules is irregular

 a vapor or boiler is a closed vessel in which water or any other liquid is heated
 isamen garam karne se utpann vaashp ko baahar nikaalane kii samuchit vyavastha bhi hoti he jisase vaashp ko vibhinn prakramon yaa garm karne ke liye upyog main laayaa ja sake
 Its design is such that at least heat is wasted on heating and it can also bear the pressure of vapor
 isamen garam kiya hua yaa vashpikrut taral ko nikaalkar vibhinn prakramon main yaa ooshmeekaran ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he, jaise- jal kaa ooshmeekaran, kendriya ooshmeekaran, vashpak-aadhaarit shakti-utpaadan, bhojan banane or safai aadi ke liye
 The mention of boilers has been seen in the history of Europe since the time of the empires of Greece and Rome, but their modern form has developed very slowly
 shakti utpaadan karne ke liye vaashp kaa upyog 19veen shatabdi se aarambh hua, lekin jab trevithik ne ucch daab ke vaashp kaa upyog apane injanon main kiya, isse pehle boyler kaa koun sa ang kitna majboot or kis dhaatu kaa ho isaki ore kisi kaa dhyaan nahin gaya tha
 By the early days of the nineteenth century, people who built boilers for any purpose would either make their own shape, according to their available means and facilities, or according to the place where they were to be seated
 aarambh main boyler taanbe kii chaadaron se or baad main pitwein lohe se banane lage
 The best shape of the boiler should be round in terms of strength and pressure, but there are great difficulties and difficulties in making water vapor by making it perfect, to sit steadily, and to make the heat of the fire reach the maximum amount of water
 
 majbootee kii drushti se golakaar ke baad duusari sabase uttam akruti belanaakaar he
 Thus, since steam is used for power generation, boilers are made cylindrical, whether they are made as a single drum or as a joint of several drums, or as a joint of drums and several tubes
 boyleron ke banane or sanchaalan ke nimitt, janata kii suraksha or boyleron kii kaaryakshmata kii drushti se ek alag shaastra hi ban gaya he, jiske kuch aavashyak vaigyanik niyam rajyon ke vidhaan main bhi aa gaye hai
 Every user of boilers is obliged to follow them
 boyleron ko unki banaavat ke anusaar do mukhya virgon main baanta jaataa he : Cornish boilers are the oldest type of fire-tube boilers
 isaki banaavat bahut hi saral hoti he, jiske kaaran yah aajkal bhi kaam main aata he
 It consists of a single smoke pipe, in the front of which a furnace is made
 aajkal yah boyler choti badi kai maapon main banaaya jaataa he
 Its smallest measure is four feet in diameter by 10 feet in length and the thickest measurement is 6 feet 6 inches in diameter and 24 feet in length
 isamen ek hi bhatthi or dhoomravahini hoti he, at: badi maap ke boyler main koyala thik prakaar se nahin jal paata or uske brihad aakaar ke anupaat se uskaa tapt dharaatal bhi kam rahata he
 Therefore, by making two furnaces equal in a Cornish type boiler, the same becomes called Lancashire boiler
 inaki anya banaavatein ek si hi hoti hai
 The smallest Lancashire boiler has a diameter of 5 feet, 6 inches and a length of 16 feet, and the largest has a diameter of 10 feet and a length of 30 feet
 anek baar isamen teen bhatthiyaan bhi bana di jaati hai
 Cornish and Lacashire boilers typically have a vapor pressure of up to 180 pounds per square inch
 in donon prakaar ke boyleron ko ant: prajvalit boyler bhi kah sakate hai, vaise to inamen agni kii jwalaaye bhatthi ke peeche kii taraf se ghumkar boyler ko baahar kii taraf se bhi tapaati hai
 In Cornish and Lancashire boilers, even with more than one furnace and large diameter smoke, their heated surface does not grow at will
 at: is uddeshy kii purti ke liye kai prakaar ke boyleron main badi agninalikaay lagane ke badale chote vyas kii anek dhumr nalikaay laga di jaati hai, jinke kaaran boyler bahunalika boyler kehalaate hai
 It can be both externally ignited and internal ignited
 bahyat: prajvalit boyler un vanya pradhan kshetron main kaam main laae jate hai jahaan jangalon main hi lakdi chirane kii aara mashine baithai jaati hai
 They are quite small in size and are portable
 is kaaran inhen le jaakar iton kii buniyadi bhatthi par rakh kar kaam chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Within the drum of the ignited boilers, one or two fire-tube furnaces and their ignition chamber are built into the foundation of the bricks, the hot gases from the back are returned from the chimney to the front of the chimney
 yah boyler drybac naam se prasiddh he
 Among the boilers, a boiler called Elephant, or Tischibin, is more commonly used in Europe
 isamen do athwa adhik dhol ek duusare ke upar neeche lage rahete hai or unka paraspar sambandh bade vyas ke chote nalon dwaara hota he
 The upper drum may or may not have thin tubes, but the lower drum must have a furnace and thin thin nozzles
 isi prakaar ke boyler kaa parishkrut rup jahaji kaamon ke liye bhi banaaya gaya he, jise scoch boyler kehete hai
 It has incorporated all the qualities of the above boilers
 lekin iskaa prajvalanakaksh purnataya boyler ke bheetar hi he, at: isamen kisi prakaar kii iton kii chinai nahin kerani padati
 The ignition boilers which are made for small tasks of running pumps etc
 are often standing boilers
 inhen cocktan boyler kehete hai
 Such standing boilers are fitted with two thick water tubes, called Galloway tubes
 jalanaliyon ke laabhon kaa varnan aage kiya gaya he
 The boiler of a rail engine is only ignited with ignition, but nowadays it is customary to install 2-4 nozzles in its furnace
 is prakaar ke boyleron main chote aakaar ke khadey boyleron ko chhod kar, jinka ullekh upar kiya ja chukaa he, anya sab jalanalika boyler bahyat: prajvalit hote hai
 They are often divided into three categories: * in which the drainage tubes are tilted from the horizon floor, pratham do shreniyon main to jal kaa pravaah swat: hi garmi kii parivahankriya dwaara hota rahata he, lekin tritiy shrenee ke boyleron main kisi pump kii sahaayta se balpurvak pravaah chaalu rakhaa jaataa he
 All waterborne, externally ignited boilers have vapors and water drums at the top and bottom respectively, which are interconnected by one or more numbers of small or large diameter vessels
 uuparavaale dholon main vaashp, athwa pani or vaashp, donon kaa mishran rahata he or nichevale dhol main keval pani or kabhi kabhi gadha pani or keechad bhi rahata he
 This drum is also called Madandram
 vibhinn dholo kii nalikaaon ke parsparik sambandh main vividhta rahane ke kaaran in boyleron ke kai varg ban jate hai
 The baycock-wilcox boiler is considered to be the best in waterborne boilers
 isamen chaar inch vyas kii nalikaaon kii shreniyan hederon main donon taraf se lagaakar, unke siron ko phula diya jaataa he or phir in hederon ke upar kii taraf lagi chaar inch vyas kii hi, lekin kam lambaai kii, naaliyon ko usee prakaar se baith kar, unke upree siron ko vaashp dhol main baitaakar, neeche kii nalikashreniyon ke puure jaal ko dhol se aage or peeche kii ore se sambandhit kar diya jaataa he
 The rear headers are connected to the bottom of the tank, collecting sludge and very condensed water as the boiler works, which is conveniently removed
 sthaliy boyleron main vaashp pani ke dhol ko naliyon kii lambaai kii disha main rakhaa jaataa he or jahaji boyleron main aadaa bhi rakh sakate hai
 There are two variations from the aqueous boiler described earlier
 is boyler kii naliyon kaa bahari vyas lagbhag shinch hota he or ve chah chah inchon ke antar par hederon se ek hi ore se judi hai or unka muda hua bhaag adhar main latakta rahata he, jis kaaran pani kaa pravaah ek hi disha main hota he
 Between these thin tubes there is another regional tube, from which the water flowing from one category of tubes goes to the regional tube and then enters another category
 is boyler kaa upyog kaarkaanon ke alaava jahaji kaamon main adhik hota he
 It is more publicized in the French fleet
 germany main bhi jahaji karmon ke liye isi se miltaa julata ek boyler banaaya gaya tha, jise durr boyler kehete hai
 In this boiler, two or three steamers are applied upwards and two or one water drum is attached to them by twisted water tubes, then it is called alpha boiler
 sidhi jalanalikaay lagane se kai laabh hote hai : pratham to vaayu kaa vyarodh badi saralata se kiya ja saktaa he; duusare sidhi nalikaaon ko aavashyaktaanusaar jis lambaai kii bhi chahen katkar lagaaya ja saktaa he, at: stock main phaltu naliyaan nahin rakhni padati; tisare pariksha karte samay naliyon kii pariksha dhol ke bheetar ghuskar saralata se kii ja sakati he or unhen badla bhi ja saktaa he
 These boilers are counted in ship boilers, which are famous for vertical tubes
 isaki sab jalanalikaay sidhi hi hai or neeche ke dhol belanaakaar hone ke badale di aakaar ke hai

 The Yarrow and Stirling boilers, which we have described above, became a little more useful for large factories and power houses with a few changes, because of the reforms, they include coal-fired, oil and iron-fired furnaces from the rejected gases
 Also started being lit
 phir bhi ve aadhunik kshetron main pichad gaye, kyonki jahaji kaamon ke liye to 575 pound prati varg inch daab kaa vaashp, jiskaa unchaa taap 399° sein
 ho, kaaphi samajha jaataa he
 If yarrow and sterling boilers make two million pounds of vapor per hour at the same pressure and heat, it is considered quite, but terrestrial factories and power houses have 1,000 pounds per square inch and sometimes even higher pressure vapor than five More than a million pounds per hour is spent
 at: dhol or jalanalikayukta boyleron ke badale adhiktar jalanalikayukta kuch aise upkaran banaae jane lage hai, jinamein dhol to nammaatr ke liye vaashp sanchit karne ke nimitt hi lagaaya jaataa he
 There is no longer any similarity between the shape of their and old boilers, hence they are called steam generators
 bhaapajanitr main vishuddh asut jal kaa panpon ke bal se patali patali naliyon main parivahan or unheen main vashpikaran bhi hota he
 This type of boilers are made in the form of a large closet, with walls made of fire bricks lining the water channels inside them with a very large fraction of the heat emitted by radiation from the furnace flames
 Absorbs and the remaining heat is absorbed by the sloping water bodies and boiler drums as necessary
 isi prakaar ke vuu vashpajanitr naamak ek bhimkarma vashpajanitr main koyale kii bukani jalaai jaati he
 It has been designed and built by the Combustion Engineering Corporation of New York and the Combustion Generator Companies of London
 yah 800 pound prati varg inch kii daab par 75 hajaar pound se lekar chaar lakh pound prati ghanta vaashp kaa utpaadan karanevaala banaaya ja saktaa he
 Its furnace is a closet, with a layer of uncluttered drainage around the walls
 is prajvalanakaksh ke chaaron konon par, neeche kii ore, koyale kii bukani sampeedit garam hawa se mishrit kar, balpurvak phuhaaron dwaara chodi jaati he
 In the form of a whirlwind of great fire, the burning gas rises up and enters the area of primary supernatant passing through the middle of the tubes near the ceiling of this ignition chamber and from there, through the door of the damper
 Entering supernatant enters, from which the gas flowing in the downward direction revolves in the diaphragm and rises upwards
 yadi mitopayojak laga ho, to gas usamen se hoti hui chimney main se baahar nikal jaati he
 This type of vaporizer occupies the least amount of space, but can produce more and more powerful vapor
 inamen atomos, benson, lamont, lowelar, suljar monotub or wilox prasiddh hai
 These too can be divided into two categories
 lowelar, lamont or viloks kii ginati ek shrenee main hoti he or benson tathaa suljar monotub kii ginati duusari shrenee main hoti he
 It was made by the John Tomson Company of Bulwer Hampton, England, to produce superheat vapor, which produces 1,000 pounds per square inch of vapor in many power houses in England, but nothing in its design Due to the low pressure vapor in it, it cannot be used
 is vashpajanitr main koyale kii bukani athwa tel eendhan kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The main part of the evaporator is the vapor and hydroelectric drum, from which water enters the bottom pumps due to its gravity
 yah pump is pani ko mulaayam ispaat kii bani jalavitarak sheershikaaon main mukhya dholak kii daab se lagbhag 35 pound prati varg inch kii atirikt daab par, bhej dete hai
 The number of these headings can also be more or less according to the composition and strength of the vaporizer
 yadi vashpajanitr nimna koti kii daab par kaam karata he, tab to sheershikaaon kii kaat ytaakar banaai jaati hai or yadi ucch daab par kaam karata he to sheershikaaon kii kaat gol banaai jaati he
 Upon reaching the headings, the water enters the evaporation tubes, whose mouths are formed in the form of ridges within the headings in such a way that the same amount of water can enter them as the amount of water that the tube can absorb
 prayek chhucchhi main kai chote chote chhed hote hai, jinamein se chhanakar pani jaataa he
 Any water that goes into the muffins is first chemically softened and airless, which causes its vapor to pass through the tubes
 vaashp kii daab unchi hone ke kaaran vishisht aaytan bhi kam hota he or us taral kaa veg bhi bahut unchaa hota he, at: anya saadhaaran byleron ke samaan bulbule nahin uthte or is vaashp tathaa pani kaa ghaneebhoot mishran banakar dhol main waapas laut aata he
 After going into the drum, the water part collects downwards and then reaches the pump and the vapor is collected in the upper part and reaches the supernatant from the top of it
 atitapak main vaashp adhik garam ho jaataa he, jahaan ke upyog ke liye vah nishkasana valb dwaara nikaal liya jaataa he
 To meet the water loss equal to the amount of vapor spent, a second pump continues to deliver fresh fill water to the eardrum through the miter
 naliyon main pani kii jo maatra pump ke dwaara chakkar khaati rahati he, uskaa bahut thodaa sa hi ansh bharnajal ke rup main aata he
 Therefore, there is no difference in the load on the pump and it always keeps moving at the same speed
 is pump ke chalaane main vashpajanitr dwaara utpann shakti kii lagbhag 0
5% shakti hi kharch hoti he
 This pump is a petal-cycle centrifuge and its design is so strong that it can withstand the full pressure of the generator
