 The stories of O
 Henry remained very famous during his lifetime, and it can be said that he tried to get into the depths of the heart, expressing displeasure with the vow of human nature in both his creations and his ideology
 vah manushya ke sachche rup ko chhipaane vaale, roodhi or vishwaas ke har parde ko cheer kar satya ke darshan karana chaahate the
 He used to say that the true feeling of truth can only be in the narrative
 apane nijee anubhav se is nishkarsh par pahunch kar, o0 henry ne vidwaanon ke is vishwaas ko fir se sthapit kar diya ki aitihaasik tathy kii apeksha, kalpana hi soundarya kaa adhik prabhaavshaalee avishkaar karti he
 Storytelling was also being changed by professional storytellers
 manushya ke bartaav ko prabhavit karne vaale har hetu ke mul, maansik or shaareerik kamiyon main dhunde jane lage the or vyakti ke jivan par saamaajik prabhaavon kaa moolyankan kiya jane laga tha
 If o had survived, where would Henry have reached- it is difficult to say, but his contribution would have been considerable
 aaj o0 henry kii kahaniyaan, uske yug ke pratik ke rup main hi padhi jaati he
 Just as the stories of Bret Hart revive the mine workers, gamblers and contractors of the western frontier, the stories of O
 Henry set the world around 1900

 apane kuch ghanisht mitron- jo mukhyat: akhabaaron ke sampadak the- kii sohabat or jaraa si sharaab use priy thi
 He always had a shortage of time, because his stories were very short and everything he would get in his change would immediately end
 sampadakon kii nirantar maang ke neeche vah pisataa rahaa
 For him, life was a chaotic business, in which the manner of award was very cynical
 fir bhi usne, is vyavhaar hi har ghup-chhaanv kaa swaagat muskaara kar kiya
 Luck and coincidence play an important part in his stories

 It is also called the 'newton-rapson method'
 ek char vaale falnon ke liye is vidhi kaa varnan is prakaar he: Suppose the function ƒ and its derivative ƒ ′, for the real x, is given
 falan f kaa mul nikaalane ke liye sabase pehle mul kaa pratham anumaan x0 lekar yah vidhi shuru hotihai
 Now x1 is derived from the following formula to give a more accurate value of the original: isi prakriya ko baar-baar doharaaya jaataa he jab tak mul kaa paryaapt rup se yatharth maan na praapt ho jaay
 This method can be understood geometrically by the following moving diagram: newton kii vidhi atyant shaktishaalee takanic he
 Its convergence is quadratic
 kintu is vidhi kii kuch samasyaayen bhi hai- This example has been resorted to to understand the working of this method
 mana sameekaran cos ⁡ = x 3 { \ displaystyle \ cos=x^{3}} kaa ek dhanatmak mul nikaalnaa he

 Let the original x 0 = 0, 5 { \ displaystyle x_ {0} = 0,5}
 is mul ke pratham 7 ank vaastavik mul ke pratham 7 ankon ke baraabar hai
 If no more than this is required, then by taking the same value of the original one can finish the calculation

 Physicists often practice a very precise mathematical theory to illustrate how a system
 Unfortunately, it is often the case that solving the theory's equations ab initio in order to produce a useful prediction is not practical
 Unfortunately, this equation is often the case that the theory is solved under the effect now that prediction in order to produce useful is not a practical one

 As a result, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, the Stalinian Soviet Union, and Nicaragua, ruled by the Sentinista, were not placed in the totalitarian category, but the Republic described by Plato, the Chin Dynasty, the Mauryan Empire of India, the Roman Empire of Diocletian, Calvinian Geneva, Japan

 According to Errent, the history of this polity that developed in the twentieth century extends from Nazism to Stalinism

 By ideology, arant meant contests to find out the rules of history

 He explained the contemporary European experience and identified the dimensions due to which totalitarianism was possible
 unhone dikhaaya ki yahudiyon kii vishisht raajnneetik or saamaajik haisiyat ke kaaran samivaad virdohi muhim ko nayi takat mili; samrajyavad ke kaaran naslvaadi andolan paidaa hue; or europee samaaj ke ukhde hue samudaayon main bant jane ke kaaran akelepan or dishaheenata ke shikaar logon ko vichaardhaaraon ke zariye golband karne main aasaani ho gayi
 After Errent, philosopher Karl Popper radically criticized Plato, Hegel and Marx, calling the efforts of 'utopian social engineering' a source of totalitarianism

 hantington kii rachana political order in changing socity kaa prakaashan hua
 In this work influenced by Hobbes's epochal composition Leviathan, Huntington argued that in underdeveloped societies many times there is no modern, professional and organized national institution other than the military that can lead them through the difficult period of transition to democracy
 aise samaajon main keval faujee shashan hi shanti-vyavastha kaayam rakhte hue aadhunikeekaran kii prakriya se nikle ashaantkaari prabhaavon ko kaabo main rakh saktaa he

 The first challenge to this dichotomy between democracy and totalitarianism came in 1970
 samaaj-vaigyanikon ne 1964 se 1974 ke bich ke daur main dekha ki laathini america ke apekshaakrit viksit deshon main hi nahin, balki spain or portugal jaise dhani deshon main adhinayakawadi shashan chal rahaa he
 In Mexico too, under the cover of democracy, there is indeed dictatorship

 They claimed that they were leading the process of development and modernization in their respective societies
 udhar asia main bhi dakshin korea or taiwan main nirankush sarkarein aarthik vikaas karne main kaamyaab dikhne lagi thim
 Studying this development, Yuan Linz in his classic work 'an Authoritarian Regime: a Case of Spain' identified an arrangement that had mixed characteristics of democracy and totalitarianism
 iske baad gulermo odonelle ne 1973 main dakshin america raajnneeti kaa adhyayan karke daawa kiya ki poonjeewaadi vikaas or aadhunikeekaran ke garbh se laathini america ke apekshaakrit nirbhar lekin viksit deshon main ek naukarshah-taanaashaahee ne janm liya he
 American political scientist Jean Kirkpatrick made a clear formulation in 1979 based on interpretations by Huntington, Linz, and o'donnell that the totalitarian are only marxist-leninist regimes
 adhinayakawadi shashan damankaaree to hota he par usamen poonjeewaadi loktantr ke rup main sudharne kii gunjaaish hoti he
 Kirkpatrick's famous article 'dictatorship and Double Standard' created a ruckus
 isaki aalochana main kaha gaya ki sarvasattavadi rajya agar girakratari, yatnaa or hatya par nirbhar rahata he to adhinayakawadi rajya isi tarah ke kaam nijee kshetra ke zariye karwaata he
 Nonetheless, Kirkpatrick became the steward of the Regan administration and tapped his political knowledge heavily for Cold War politics
 sheet yuddh khatm ho jane ke baad raajnneetishastra ke daayaron main is samay sthiti yah he ki vidwaanon ne sarvasattawad kii shrenee ko puri tarah se kaarij karke adhinayakawadi vyavasthaaon kii ek nayi vyapak shrenee banaayi he

 is varnan se zaahir he ki in pravritiyon kii shinaakht khud ko puri tarah se loktantric kehane vaale rajyon main bhi kii ja sakati he
 In this sense, totalitarianism is now more of a trend than the liberal democratic systems established

 vitt main, poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model kaa upyog kisi poonjigat parisampatti ke liye saidhantik rup se upyukt vaanchit pratilabh dar gyaat karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jab is parisampatti ko ek pehle se hi suvishakheekrut sanvibhag main joda janaa ho, tathaa jabaki us parisampatti kaa ashaakhneey jokhim gyaat ho
 In this model the intractable risk of the asset, which is often represented by 'beta' in the finance sector, is taken into account and also the expected return on the market and the expected return on the theoretical risk-free asset
 siepiem kaa suzav he ki kisi niveshak kii share poonji kii laagat kaa nirdhaaran 'beta' se hota he
 ”: 2 The broad form of this model is the bi-beta model, which distinguishes the upward beta from the overlying beta

 This version was more rigorous in empirical testing and was an effective contributor to the global acceptance of CPM
 mulya nirdhaaran va portpholio chayan ke kai aadhunik tareekon ke aagaman tathaa antarpanan anubhavik khaamiyon, ke baavjood apni saadhaaranta va vibhinn prakaar paristhitiyon main upyogita ke kaaran siepiem abhi bhi adhik prachlit he
 CAPM is a model for pricing a single asset or group of assets
 akeli pratibhuti ke liye, ham pratibhuti bazaar rekha tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh va systematic jokhim ke saath uske sambandh kaa prayog yah jaanane ke liye karte hai ki bazaar ke dwaara kisi ek pratibhuti kii keemat uski jokhimshrenee kii tulana main kitni nirdhaarit hogi
 The yield-risk ratio can also be calculated from the securities market line compared to the entire market of a single asset
 atah jaise jaise kisi sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratilabh uske beta kofishent dwaara ghatata chalaa jayega, is akeli sampatti kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat, sampurna bazaar ke pratifal-jokhim anupaat ke baraabar hota chalaa jayega
 Like this: bazaar kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat hi prabhavi taur par bazaar jokhim adhimulya / premium he or uparokt sameekaran ko punah niyojan karne par tathaa e kaa maan nikaalane par, hamen poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model praapt ho jaataa he
 Where: yadi isi ko jokhim premium ke drushtikon se punarlekith kiya jaae, to ham pate hai ki: That is, the "own risk premium" of an asset - the product of "market risk premium" and "beta"
 note 1: bazaar ke pratyaashit pratifal kaa anumaan praayah kisi bazaar-portpholio ke aitihaasik pratifalon ke maan kaa gyometric ausat nikaalkar lagaaya jaataa he
 Note 2: The 'risk-free rate of return' used to calculate risk is often the arithmetic average of historical rates and not the current rate
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 The CPM can be modified to include size overload and specific risk
 yah un niveshkon ke liye mahatvapurn he jinke paas ek unnat-vishakhit portpholio nahin he
 The equation is very similar to the traditional CAPM equation "in which market risk weighting is replaced by multiplication of beta product and market risk weighting:": 5 "jahaan: The securities market line depicts the CPM formula as a graph
 x aksh par jokhim ko dikhaate hai or y aksh par pratyaashit pratilabh
 Market risk is estimated by the slope of the securities market line
 β tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh ke madhya sambandh kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha par kiya jaataa he, jo ki pratyaashit pratilabh ko β ke falan ke rup main pradarshit karata he
 The intercept is the nominal risk-free rate available in the market, while the slope is the market premium, E− Rf
 esa kaha ja saktaa he ki pratibhuti bazaar rekha as representing a single-factor model of the asset price ko dikhaati he, jabaki β se pataa chalata he ki uski bazaar main parivartanon se prabhavit hone kii sambhaavna kitni he is prakaar SML kaa sameekaran is prakaar he: It is a very important tool in such situations when it is to find out whether a asset / security will give an acceptable return compared to the risk
 akeli parisampattiyon kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha graph par kiya jaataa he
 If the mutual depiction of risk and return is above the line, it means that the security is getting cheaper and more profit can be expected on it
 yadi chithran rekha se neeche aa pade to mulya ko manhagaa samajha janaa chahie tathaa isamen utana laabh nahin milegaa jitna ki jokhim uthaaya ja rahaa he
 After knowing the expected / desired profit rate e { \ displaystyle E} using CAPM, it can be compared to the expected return rate of the asset to determine whether the investment is good or not
 iske liye hamen sampatti ke pratilabh ke swatantra anumaan kii gananaa kii aavashyaktaa hogi jo ki praayah fundamental athwa technical vishleshan, anupatik vishleshan aadi ke dwaara kii jaati he
 According to CAMP, if the estimated value is equal to the future cashflow adjusted with the rate suggested by the asset's CAPM - then the asset is meeting at the right price
 yadi anumaanit mulya siepiem moolyankan se adhik he to sampatti sasti he 
 An asset not located on the securities market line indicates a discrepancy in its value
 chunki samaybindu t { \ displaystyle t} par sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratifal e = e − p t p t { \ displaystyle E={ \ frac {e-p_{t}}{p_{t xxrep 4 } jo ki siepim dwaara sujhaaye pratifal se adhik he, to iskaa arth he ki p t { \ displaystyle P_{t}} bahut kam he, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t+1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 Using CAPM, the value of the asset p 0 { \ displaystyle P_ {0}}, can be displayed with the following linear relation: jahaan p t { \ displaystyle P_{T}} sampatti yaa portpholio kaa payoff he
 It can be found out by the CAMP that what should be the expected return ie adjustment rate, taking into account the relative risk of a particular asset
 yadi beta kaa maan ek se adhik ho to iskaa arth he - ausat se adhik jokhim; ek se kam kaa arth he - ausat se kam jokhim
 Thus, a higher risk stock will have a higher beta and will be adjusted at a higher rate
 jabaki kam samvedansheel stox kaa beta kam hoga or unhen kam dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 This is in line with the prevailing informal assumption that high risk-taking investors desire higher returns
 kyonki beta kisi ek parisampatti ke jokhim kii puure bazaar jokhim ke prati samvedansheeltaa kaa paimaana he, to paribhaasha se spasht he ki bazaar jokhim kaa beta kaa maap hoga : 1
 The stock market index is used extensively as a complementary measure to measure market risk, hence its beta measure is 1
 is prakaar, ek bade or suvishakhit portpholio ke niveshak apane nivesh se bazaar kii chaal ke anusaar hi parinaamon kii apeksha kar sakate hai
 The risk in any portfolio is primarily the sum of two types of risk - systemic risk, also known as market risk or non-intangible risk, and disorderly risk known as branchial risk
 vyavasthaatmak yaa bazaar jokhim un kaarnon kii vajah se hota he jo samast nivesh vikalpon arthath puure bazaar ko prabhavit karte he
 This type of risk is difficult to control
 avyavashthaatmak jokhim vah jokhim he jo kisi vishesh pratibhuti athwa nivesh vikalp ko prabhavit karata he
 Such risk can be controlled by diversifying the investment
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i
e
 its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness—as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i
e
 less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 CAPM assumes that the risk-return ratio of an investment can be corrected, an ideal portfolio would be one with minimal risk to a defined return rate
 iske atirikt, kyonki portpholio main judane vaali har nai sampatti portpholio kaa or vishaakhan karti he, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above 
 All such optimal portfolios, i
e
, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 koi niveshak esa bhi kar saktaa he ki vah apni nidhi kaa kuch hissaa to jokhimayukt sampattiyon main nivesh kare tathaa kuch hissaa nakad bachaakar rakhe, jise jokhim rahit dar par kamai hoti rahe
 
 yahan par jokhimayukt va jokhimamukt kaa anupaat overall return ko nirdhaarit nahin karata - yah sambandh nishchit hi linear he
 In this way it is possible that a certain return can be achieved by any one of the following types: haalaanki ek nishchit pratilabh ke liye, uparokt main se koi ek vikalp hi kushal siddh hoga 
 Since the risk-free asset is not necessarily correlated with any other asset, the second option will usually have less deviation, which would make it more efficient of the two
 yah sambandh prabhavi seemaa par sthit anya portpholios ke liye bhi sahi hoga : ucch pratilabh ke saath kuch nakad- adhik kushal he bajaay - usee pratilabh dar par maatr nimna pratilabh vaale portpholio ke
 For a fixed risk-free rate, there will be only one efficient portfolio that can be combined with cash to achieve a minimum risk position for any return
 yahi market portpholio he
 All investors: dwi-beta model urdhvagami beta ko adhigami beta se bhinn karata he
 The difference between the CPM and bi-beta models is that the CPM model recognizes that the upward and the succeeding betas are the same, whereas the bi-beta model does not believe so
 asi manyata kabhi virale hi thik hoti he, atah dwi-beta model ko hi adhik upyukt mana jaataa he
 The ridiculous presentation of an event is called a joke or joke
 ise angrezi main 'joke' kehete hai or ise latifa bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is often said that "latife lives in the last jumle" - in English this sentence is called 'punchline'
 latifa ek choti si kahani ho saktaa he yaa ek laghu vaakyansh yaa vaakya ke rup main bhi ho saktaa he
 Latifes are often simple means of entertaining friends and audiences
 chutkule sunaane kaa uddeshy attahas paidaa karnaa hota he
 But for some reason, when this cannot happen, sometimes jokes are mocked
 manovaigyanikon or sahitya par anusandhan karne waalon ne is prashn par kaaphi gaharaai se adhyayan kiya he ke chutkulon par log bebasii se hanste kyon hai
 Many subtle questions arise about this topic, such as why is it that when one man tells a joke, people laugh but when they tell another, they do not laugh? It is believed that stress fluctuations have a very important contribution in many jokes
 jaise ki ek chutkula he ki - Initially in this latte, tension arises due to crazy running
 or phir lagata he ke yah to pagal he hi nahin, isliye tanaav kam hota he lekin thodaa sa shaq bana rahata he
 And then immediately the tension flares up again
 kisi bhi latife main yah zaruri he ke tanaav kaa yah utaar-chadhaav aakasmik lage, yani jahaan tanaav badhane ki ummid ho vahaan ulta ghat jaae or jahaan ghatane ki sambhaavna lage vahaan ulta bad jaae
 Good joke makers keep this tension flowing
 kuch latifon main tanaav kaa itnaa utaar-chadhaav nahin hota lekin unamem bhi ummid se kuch vipareet hota he jo vyangypurna dhang se chaunkaa jaae

 punjab kshetra main holi ke multan shahar main janm liya prahlada-puri mandir main
 The original temple of Prahladpuri is said to have been built by Prahlada, the son of Hiranyakashipu, the king of Multan Kashya-pur) in honor of Narasimha Avatar, an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, who emerged from the pillar to save Prahlada

 The word Holi is derived from the past which Rashi Holika burnt herself to death when her brother tried to burn herself in Prahlada's lap
 prahlada-puri mandir or holikaa dahan prahlada hindu bhagwaan vishnu kaa bhakt tha
 His devotion was tested by his fiery father Hiranyakashyap who was the king of Multan
 unki bhakthi kaa ek parinaam ke rup main unhone vishesh shaktiyaan bhagwaan vishnu dwaara diya gaya tha
 In his ego, the people of Hiranyakashyap Multan made Lord Vishnu instead of worshiping him
 lekin prahlada bhagat bane apane prabhu ke bhakt he
 Prahlada Hiranyakaship, poisoned powerful elephants and trampled him under the snake's feet, imprisoned him

 Then i was forced, in a great funeral pyre, to sit on Holika's lap
 holikaa hiranyakashyap kii bahan thi
 a magical shawl that prevented her from burning with fire
 vah uski god main prahlada le or aag main pravesh karne ke liye pasand kii peshkash kii
 Prahlada is thus burnt, while Holika will preserve him by shawl
 kinvadanti he ki jab vah aag pravesh kiya, ek tej hawa uda diya or surakshatmak shawl bajaay holikaa prahlada ke cover yah he
 Holi in Punjab begins with water symbolizing the effigy of Holika on the night before Holi and is known as Holika Dahan
 aag holikaa lene gaya tha, vahiin bhagwaan vishnu narsingh ke rup main dikhaai diya or hiranyakashyap par paunsad, use do tukdon main kaat rahaa he
 The temple marks the location of the event as the festival of Holi celebrates this event, and the Sun Temple of Multan is its memorial temple

 In the mid-17th century, French mathematician René decart made it very powerful by using algebra in geometry
 usne pehle do katati hui rekhaayen leen, jinhen aksh kehete hai
 The distance measured in parallel to these lines of a point is determined by its number or two
 ye rekhaayen bindu ke nirdeshaank kehalaati hai
 With the help of these coordinates each geometric fact can be represented by an algebraic equation
 is jyamiti kaa kai dishaao main vikaas hua
 In the first case, a broader form of geometry emerged, such that the equation of an exponent represents a simple line
 isi prakaar do ghaat kaa sameekaran ek shankav pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equations of powers three, four and higher began to be studied and the properties of their corresponding curves became much simpler than before
 tal ke vakron tak hi nahin, avkaash ke vakron kaa bhi adhyayan sambhav ho gaya
 For this, the points of a point from a three-point plane are determined by its distance and represent each point along an equation in Y, R, L
 in samikarnon ke vivechan se talon ore vakron ke gunon kaa adhyayan saralata se hota he
 In the other direction, the solution of composition related questions and activities became very simple
 ye kriyaayein keval kuch samikarnon ke hal par hi nirbhar hai, jisamen bahut vyapak prashn saralata se hal ho jate hai; jaise yadi rekha kisi vakr = o ko katati he, to in donon samikarnon ke hal unke kataan binduon kaa sthaan nishchit karenge
 If the origin of these equations is real, the line cuts the curve
 yadi baraabar hai to rekha vakr ko sparsh karti he
 If imaginary, the line does not intersect the curve, but we can say that the line will always cut the curve at two points, whether the points are real or coincident, or imaginary
 isi prakaar se tathy bade vyapak rup main die ja sakate hai, jo saadhaaran jyamiti main sambhav nahin tha
 In the third direction, coordinate geometry broadened the dimension
 do sankhyaayein ya, r do vimitiyon main tathaa teen sankhyaayein teen vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karti hai
 Now, the question arose in front of mathematicians as to what the four numbers Y, R, L, and the five numbers Y, R, L, V, would represent
 ganitagyon ne to amoort rup se apane mastishk main badi aasaani se soch liya ki chaar sankhyaayein chaar vimitiyon main or paanch sankhyaayein paanch vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karengi
 In this way, he also thought well of the anomalies
 unhen isse koi matlab nahin ki parthiv jagat main uskaa koi udhaaharan he yaa nahin
 Einstein must have used this idea in his theory of relativity and clarified the idea of aversion
 ab is ucch vimiti ke vichaar kaa aprayukt ganit main kuch kathin samasyaon ko hal karne main upyog karte hai
 For example, the number of different particles in a moving fluid is represented by seven numbers
 ve hai k, kha, ga, uskaa praarambhik sthaan, tathaa teen veg, jo ya, r, l aksh ke samaantar hon, tathaa samay, yah saat vimiti kaa prashn samajhakar hal ho saktaa he
 In the fourth direction, coordinate geometry generalized numbers and imaginary numbers emerged
 kalpanik bindu tathaa kaalpanik vakr ityadi vichaaron ne jyamiti ko bahut mahatvashaalee bana diya, jisase vyapkikaran main or adhik sahaayta mili, jaise anant par do kaalpanik binduon se janevaala shaankab vrutt hota he, ityadi
 In addition, geometry was discussed with the help of different types of coordinates, such as quadratic coordinates, triangular coordinates, tangent coordinates, etc

 The ancient philosophers of Europe also believed in its existence and there it was called "muzik of the Spiers"
 vah shabd vaa naad jo donon haathon ke angutho se donon kaanon ko band karke dhyaan karne se sunai detaa he
 Anhad word or sabd
 jo bina kisi aghat ke hi utpann hua ho
 Naad has been said to be an indicator of the manifestation of the latent permutations, which first remain in the subtle form of the word "whole" and then become empirical by becoming the word "apara" respectively

 bydaree ke alaava, GSM mobile phone ko kaam karne ke liye ek choti si microchip kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jise graahak pahchaan maapdand yaa sim card kaha jaataa he
 The SIM card of approximately a postage stamp size is usually placed at the back of the unit under the battery and stores the configuration data and information about the phone, such as which call scheme the user is using
 jab graahak sim card ko hataa detaa he, to ise pun: duusare phone main daal kar saamaanya rup se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Each SIM card is activated by the use of a unique numeric identifier; Once activated, the identifier is localized and the card is permanently clad in the active network
 is kaaran se, adhikansh khudara vikreta ek sakriy kiye gaye sim card ko vaapis lene se inkaar kar dete hai
 Cell phones that do not use a SIM card have data programmed into their memory
 ek vishesh aankik kram kaa upyog karke is data kaa upyog kiya jaataa he he, "NAM" ko "naam" yaa number kramadesh suchi ke rup main upyog karne ke liye
 From here, one can get any information such as a number for your phone, new service provider number, new emergency number, change of their authentication key or A-key code and list or perl to rotate their favorites
 However, to prevent someone from accidentally deactivating their phone or deleting it from the network, service providers use a master assistant shut down or MSL on this data
 MSL yah sunishchit karata he ki seva pradaata khride gaye yaa patte par liye gaye phone ke liye bhugtan praapt karen
 For example, the Motorola RAZR V9C costs more than CAD $ 500
 lagbhag $200 main, vaahak ke aadhaar par, aapako ek mil sakati he
 The difference is paid by the customer as a monthly bill
 yadi graahak ne ek MSL kaa upyog nahin kiya, to ve $300 - $400 kaa antar kho denge jo unke masik bill main bhugtan kiya jaataa he, kyunki kuch graahak maujuuda seva ko radd karke duusare vaahak ke paas phone le jate hai
 The MSL applies to the SIM only because once the contract is completed, the MSL still applies to the SIM
 phone haalanki, shuru main bhi seva pradaata MSL main nirmaataa dwaara band kiya jaataa he
 This lock can be disabled so that this phone can use another service provider's SIM card
 america ke baahar kharide gaye phone khule phone hai kyonki vahaan zyaadaatar phone ek duusare ke nikatataa main kai seva pradaata yaa ativyapee vyapti he
 The cost of unlocking a phone varies but is usually very inexpensive and sometimes provided by independent phone vendors
 saamaanya vyapti kshetra ke baahar MSL seva pradaata ke upyog main ucch laagat kii vajah se ek khulaa phone yatriyon ke liye behad upyogi hota he
 This can sometimes be 10 times the price of using a closed phone as a foreigner in the general service area, even with discounted rates

 udhaaharan ke liye, jamaika main, ek AT&T graahak bhunaai antarrashtriya seva ke liye $1
65 prati minute kaa atirikt bhugtan kar saktaa he jabaki ek B-mobile graahak ko samaan antarrashtriya seva ke liye $0
20 prati minute kaa bhugtan karnaa padegaa
kuch seva pradaata apane bikri ko antarrashtriya bikri par kendrit karte hai jabaki kuch kshetreey bikri par kendrit karte hai
 For example, the same b-mobile customer will pay less on local calls but more on international calls than in Jamaica's national phone C&W company
 yah mulya antar mukhyatah mudra parivartan ke kaaran hota he kyonki sim kii kharid sthaneey mudra main hoti he
 In the US, competition in these types of services does not exist because some major service providers do not offer pay-when-you-go service

 An early form of dialectical logics developed in Greece
 arestu ke anusaar elia ke jenon is paddati ke aavishkarta the
 In general terms, the art of debate has been called dialectical method
 isko atyant sulajhaa hua evam spasht rup sucraat ne diya
 The basic feature of this method is to progressively move towards coordination considering the problem through questions and answers
 aflatoon ne apane sanvaadon main sucraat ko mahatvapurn sthaan diya he, jisase pataa chalata he ki ve is paddati ke sarvshereshth pratinidhi the
 Aflatun has considered dialectical reasoning as the principle of supreme knowledge

 The subject matter of dialectical reasoning is epistemology and the nature of reality
 aflatoon ke anusaar yah vaigyanik vidhi anya sabhi vidhiyon se shreshth he, kyonki iske madhyam se spashtatam gyaan praapt hota he
 Therefore dialectical reasoning is supreme knowledge

 Because it was first used to inaugurate the spiritual world, then it was used to inaugurate the physical world, then it was applied to the physical world
 kaant is paddati ko sristishastra, ishwar evam amarta ke sandarbh main nayaa arth dete hai
 Kant has used this method when interpreting counterintuitive reasoning, arguments and suffixes
 buddhi ke niyam desh-kaal-gat sthit jagat par hi lagu kiye ja sakate hai, lekin jab ise parmaarthik satyon par lagu karte hai to hamaare saamne sapratipakshi tark, tarkabhas evam anubhavathit bhram kii samasya aa khadi hoti he
 Hegel took advantage of this insight of Kant
 vastav main hegel hi dwandvatmak tark ke aadhunik vyaakhyaata hai
 According to him dialectical reasoning is basically the distinguishing nature of meditative thought
 ye vichaar pranali yaa saamaanya ke swabhaav ko vyakt karte hai
 It has three moments in its motion, in the order which have been called ism, counter-argument and dialogue
 is prakaar dwandvatmak tark kii pravriti samanvay kii ore unmukh hoti he
 Coordination or dialogue is the higher unity of debate and protest, though it differs from both, yet both are advanced in it
 is prakaar yahan spasht ho jaataa he ki dwandvatmak tark vichaaron kii gati se sambandhit he
 According to Hegel, the ultimate truth or absolute truth expresses itself in this form
 hegel ke tarkshastra main sarvaadhik mahatv isi paddati kaa he
 They use dialectical logic to identify any kind of problem
 unke anusaar dwandvatmak tark hi unki paddati kaa mul tatv he
 This method is present at every place in their system
 mulat: yah nishedh ke niyam se gatisheel hoti he
 But through this prohibitiveness, she progresses to coordination
 hegel ne param pratyay kii vyakhya dwandvatmak tark se prastut kii he
 The ultimate suffix is conceived as the object of truth, but in its original form it is abstract, transcendental and omnipotent
 isliye hegel kaa pratyaywad tark he
 Instead of applying it to soul, consciousness or nirguna, it can be given more meaning if it is applied to nature and history
 karl marks ne isliye kaha tha ki hegel ne dwandvatmak tark ko sir ke bal khadaa kiya he
 Marx and Engels owe it to them to stand on their feet

 The motion of nature itself is considered dialectical

 For him, since the time of the country, there is no importance of any immortal authority
 utpatti, vikaas or vinaash, ye hi vishwa kii visheshtaayen hai
 Dialectical philosophy is the byproduct of the mind's own thought process
 marks ke anusaar dwandvatmak tark gati ke samaanya niyamon kaa vigyaan he
 Whether this motion is of the external world, whether it is the motion of the inner mind, both these movements are studied in it

 In mathematics, the Cauchy – Eiler equation is a linear quadratic simple differential equation with variable coefficients
 kabhi kabhi ise samavimiya sameekaran ke ke rup main bhi nirdisht kiya jaataa he
 Due to its simple structure, this equation can be replaced by equations with fixed coefficients that can be solved explicitly
 mana y agyaat falan y kaa n vaan avkalaj he
 Then the cauchy-eiler equation of n series is obtained as follows x = e u { \ displaystyle x=e^{u}} rakhane par uparokt sameekaran niyat gunank vaali raikhik avakal sameekaran ke rup main praapt hoti he
 Alternatively, the test solution may take y = xm { \ displaystyle y = x ^ {m}} as the base solution
 saamaanya kaushi-islar sameekaran dwitiya koti kii sameekaran he, jo bhautik vigyaan or abhiyantriki ke vibhinn anuprayogon main prayukt hoti he, jaise dhruviya nirdeshaankon main laplas sameekaran ko hal karte samay
 This is given by the following equation: nimna hal ko uparokt sameekaran kaa ek hal lene par On calculating: or Putting these values in the real equation: punarvinyasit karne par : On solving the above equation to get the value of m
 yahan teen vishesh sthitiyaan praapt hoti hai : In case # 1, the comprehensive solution of the Kaushi – Eiler equation would be: sthiti # 2 main, vyapak hal nimna prakaar hoga To obtain this solution, a class reduction method is used after obtaining a solution y = xm
 sthiti # 3 main, vyapak hal nimna prakaar diya jaataa he : Here c 1 { \ displaystyle c_ {1} \ ,} and c 2 { \ displaystyle c_ {2} \ ,} are real integral constants
 is tarah ke hal islar sutara kii sahaayat se x = et rakhane par praapt kiya jaataa he
 Using the following variable substitution avkalan karne par: Putting these values in the first equation: φ { \ displaystyle \ phi} uparokt sameekaran jo φ { \ displaystyle \ phi } main he ko iske abhilakshanik bahupad ke upyog se saralata se hal karne par Now, if λ 1 { \ displaystyle \ lambda _ {1}} and λ 2 { \ displaystyle \ lambda _ {2}} are the origin of the polynomial, then we will solve in the following two cases: fractions origin and bi-root: yadi mul ek duusare se bhinn hai to to vyapak hal nimna sameekaran dwaara diya jaataa he If the roots are the same then the broad solution is given as follows in donon sthitiyon main, hal y { \ displaystyle y}, t = ln ⁡ { \ displaystyle t= \ ln} rakhane par praapt kiya ja saktaa he, atah φ ) = y { \ displaystyle \ phi )=y} 
 So in the first stage, mana Putting the simple solution xα: xα ek hal hone ke liye aavashyak he ki yaa to x = 0, jo saadhaaran hal detaa he yaa xα kaa gunank shunya he
 Solving the quadratic equation we get α = 1, 3
 atah vyapak hal nimna hoga Here the differential equation is similar to the Kaushi – Eiler equation

 isaki tulana xm ke k wein avkalaj se tulana karne par suggests that we can solve the N-th order difference equation in a similar manner to the differential equation case
 Indeed, substituting the trial solution brings us to the same situation as the differential equation case, One may now proceed as in the differential equation case, since the general solution of an N-th order linear difference equation is also the linear combination of n linearly independent solutions
 Applying reduction of order in case of a multiple root m1 will yield expressions involving a discrete version of ln, = ∫ 1 + m 1 x 1 t - m 1 dt
 { \ displaystyle \ ln = \ int _ {1 + m_ {1}} ^ {x} { \ frac {1} {t-m_ {1}}} \ , dt
