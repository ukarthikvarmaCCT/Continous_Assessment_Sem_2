 Born in northern Andhra Pradesh of South India, this Mahabali created panic all over the world at one time
 swayan british samraat george pancham va maharani mairi ne landan sthit buckingham pales main aamantrit kar sammanit kiya or indian harkulis va indian sandose jaise upnaam pradaan kiye
 Seeing the feat of their physical force, all the people from the common people to the ruling class were forced to press the finger under the teeth
 pro sahab ne vyaayaam kii jo nayi paddati viksit kii use aaj bhi bhartiya mallayuddh ke kshetra main pro ramamurti kii vidhi ke naam se janaa jaataa he jisamen dand-baithak ke dainandin abhyaas se sharir ko atyadhik balashaali banaaya jaataa he
 Born in April 1882 to Veekanna Naidu's home in Veeraghatam village in Srikakulam district in northern Andhra Pradesh, South India, Professor Ramamurthy Pehalwan's real name was Kodi Ramamurthy Naidu
 bachapan main maan kaa nidhan ho jane se balak nirankush ho gaya or ham umr saathiyon kii pitai karke un par apana rob jataane laga
 When the father thrashed him, he left the house and went into the forest and hid and after a week, he raised a leopard's child on the shoulder
 ramamurti din bhar chitah ke bachche ko kandhe par uthaaye puure veeraghattem gaanv main ghumaa karata or saare gaanv vaale dar ke maare apane-apane gharon main dubake rahete
 In this way he strangled the whole village
 aakhirkaar uske pita ne yukti se kaam liya or use apane chote bhai narayan swami ke paas vijaynagar bhej diya jo un dinon vahaan police inspector the
 Ramamurthy's uncle was in the police where every soldier was given physical training, so he felt like there
 ab to vah parishram se padhai bhi karata or shaareerik vyaayaam bhi
 He used to enjoy a lot in body building
 narayanswami ne usko fitness centre main daakhil kara diya jahaan usne ji tod abhyaas kiya or mahabali kaa sapana liye apane gaanv lautaa
 But instead of fame in the village environment, he had to face satirical vaanas, which provoked him to slam the village pits
 aakhirkaar pareshaan hokar pita vainkanna use phir apane bhai ke paas vijaynagar chhod aaye
 Seeing the nephew's interest in wrestling, Chacha sent him to Madras where after a full year he went back to Vijayanagara after getting intensive training for the wrestler
 narayanswami ne use ek vidhyalay main shaareerik prashikshak kii naukari dilaa di
 In addition to a job in Vijayanagar, Ramamurthy started open demonstrations of physical force in which huge crowds of people used to gather
 ek baar lard minto vijaynagar aaye
 Ramamurthy got a game thought
 usne unki lambi chaudee motor car kaa peeche kaa hud kas kar pakad liya or unke driver ko car start karne ko kaha
 Lord Minto's surprise did not remain when the car could not move even an inch
 isse ramamurti kii khyaati dur-dur tak fail gayi
 Now he got an idea in his mind - why not entertain the public by performing physical force and earn money too
 uske ek mitra potti punthulu ne is vichaar ko kriyanvit karne main puraa sahyog kiya
 Both of them worked hard and Professor Ramamurthy's circus company set many records for their show
 bi chandraiya naidu ke paraamarsh se unhone sarkas kii kala kaa upyog deshbhakti kaa jowar jagaane main kiya
 While on one hand they attracted the attention of the public with the amazing display of their physical force, on the other hand, they also taught the youth to increase their physical strength by telling them the easy method of punishing the meeting so that when the time comes, the enemy can be repulsed
 is prakaar unki sarkas company ne puure hindustan kaa bhraman kiya or sthaan-sthaan par yuvaaon ko deshbhakti kaa paath padhaaya
 At the Congress session of Allahabad, Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya invited him to demonstrate his physical strength
 elahabaad main jo ascharyajanak pradarshan unhone kiye unase unki khyaati desh kii simaaon ko paar kar videsh main ja pahaunchi
 Malaviya ji inspired them for this and also provided means
 sabase pehle unhone landan jaakar buckingham pales main king jorge pancham or queen mairi ke samaksh pradarshan kiya
 Seeing his amazing performance, the King and Queen of Britain were so overwhelmed that they were given adjectives like Indian Hercules and Indian Sandoz
 jab unhone george pancham ke saamne angreji main in donon visheshnon ke saath-saath bhartiya mall vidya ke puronik pratik bhim kaa tulanaatmak vivaran pesh kiya to king jorge ko apni bhul kaa ahsaas hua or usne khadey hokar maafee maangi
 Not only this, the British Emperor passed a government order and publicly announced the title of Kaliyugi Bhima for Professor Ramamurthy and was given this title with full state honors in England
 iske pashchaat unhen kai deshon se bulaava aayaa or ve vahaan khushi-khushi gayi
 Professor Saheb went to Spain after persuading Indian power in France, Germany and Japan
 spain kii bul fite dekhne ke liye unhen aamantrit kiya gaya
 Seeing the bull fight, the unit became enraged and announced to Mike that what bravery it is to kill a weighed bull with holes
 If any of you Spaniards have the courage and strength, then get down in the unarmed ring and defeat it and show it
 yadi aap main se koi yah nahin kar saktaa to main yah kauthuk dikhaane ko prastut hoon
 He not only boasted only, but also showed what he said
 logon kii ankhen fatty kii fatty rah gayin jab ramamurti apana kaala chonga pahanakar nihathe ring main utre or khoonkhwaar saand ke sing pakad kar apni balishtha bhujaaon se us par kaabo kar liya or maidan se baahar bhagaakar sabko aashcharyachakit kar diya

 Mahendra then marries Sudha and is quite happy, but Maya's sudden return creates tension in their married life
 jab maaya aatmahatya kaa prayaas karti he, to mahendra uske saath samay bitaana shuru kar detaa he

 jaisaa hi sudhaa kaa pati apane saamaan ke saath pratiksha kaksh chodta he, mahendra ne sudhaa se use maaf karne ke liye kaha
 She touches Mahendra's feet as a plea for his forgiveness and permission to leave him
 aisa, jo usne unke pichhali baar alag hone par nahin kiya tha
 Mahendra blesses her for a happy life

 Sanjay uses the methods of tattooing, taking notes, and tattooing on his body to return his memory again after every 15-minute cycle
 har subah jab sanjay shauchalay jaataa he, vah vaash basin main nal kii tonti ke paas hi "kameez utaaro" likhaa hua ek note dekhtaa he
 As he takes off the shirt, he sees a series of tattoos on his wide chest
 jab vah "kalpana kii hatya kar di gai thi" guda hua dekhtaa he to ek sire se yah udghaatit ho jaataa he ki sanjay antat kalpana kii hatya kaa badla lene ke liye pra tibaddh he or isiilie vah pariklpit tareeke se ek-ek kar un logon ko maar rahaa he jo kalpana kii maut ke jimmedaar the
 The written notes and the pierced tattoos provide clear evidence that its main target is Ghajni
 aakhirkaar yah bhi saafe-saafe jaahir ho jaataa he ki gajani or koi nahin balki shahar kaa ek prasiddh saamaajik vyaktitv he
 Mumbai Police Inspector Arjun Yadav is involved in the investigation of the case related to serial murders
 vah sanjay kaa pataa lagaate hue use uske flats main khoj nikaalte hai or usapar hamalaa kar use apahiz kar dete hai
 Arjun Yadav is surprised to see the extensive set of photographs and written notes
 unhen aisi do diariyaan milteen hai jinamein 2005 or 2006 kii ghatnaon ko kram se lipibaddh kiya gaya he
 The film enters the pre-2005 scene as soon as Inspector Yadav reads the 2005 diary
 sanjay singhania ek pratishthit vyapaaree vansh kaa vyakti he jo air voyas telephone company kaa maalik he
 He has finished his education abroad and returned to take over his family business
 apane kaarobaar ke dauraan sanjay apane karmchaariyon ko ek jujharu abhinetri / model kalpana se milane evam uske apartment ke upar air voyas kaa vishaal vigyaapan board lagane ke bare main baatcheet karne ke liye bhejtaa he
 The owner of Kalpana's modeling / advertising company forgets to think of it as a romance affair and encourages Kalpana to accept the proposal
 vah pramukh model ke rup main uski padonnati kar detaa he
 Kalpana is usually sweet and kind
 vah ise bataur ek maasoom sharaarat karne ke liye sweekaar kar leti he or is prakaar sanjay ke garlfriend ke rup main paheliyon se bharaa naatakeey khel shuru karti he
 Sanjay finally meets Kalpana but he tells him that he is Sachin and is an Adana human who has come from a small town to a big city in search of new life
 kalpana use modling ke chote-mote kaam dilaati he
 Slowly she is drawn towards him in his hypnosis and Sachin also gets swept away in her mildness, simplicity and compassion
 unhen ek duusare se pyaar ho jaataa he or sanjay ko antat usase shaadi kaa prastaav pesh karne kii himmat ho jaati he
 She asks for some time to consider his proposal
 sanjay sthir karata he ki agar vah uske prastaav ko sweekaar kar leti he to vah apni asli pahchaan uske saamne ujagar kar degaa; or agar vah asweekaar karti he, to vah chupchaap bina koi haani pahunchaae waapas laut jayega
 The film's story then returns to the present; When Yadav starts reading the 2006 diary
 sanjay achaanak aa jaataa he, yadav par hamalaa kar detaa he or use baandh detaa he
 He discovers Ghazni at a college function where he is the honorable head guest
 sanjay gajani ke kuch chayachitr letaa he or use jaan se maar daalane kaa faisla karata he 
 usee samaaroh main uski mulaaqaat sunita se ho jaati he; vah bhi uske file par lage cover se use pahchaan leti he or usase dosti karne kaa iraadaa karti he
 Later that same evening, Sanjay kills a goon of Ghazni in the parking area
 vah gajani ke aane kaa intjaar karne lagata he lekin ant main usapar phir kabhi kisi or maukey par aakhri hamalaa karne kaa faisla karata he
 The dying injured Gunda reminds Ghazni of an incident that took place two years ago in which Kalpana was murdered and Sanjay became a patient after being hurt
 gajani asamanjas main pad jaataa he or kuch bhi yaad kar paane main naakaam ho jaataa he
 Meanwhile, Sunita comes to Sanjay's flat and finds Yadav beaten and tied
 use is baat kaa pataa bhi lag jaataa he ki gajani hi sanjay kaa nishaanaa he
 Yadav also informs him that Sanjay is a known serial killer
 sunita ke haathon do diariyaan lag jaatin hai or vah yadav ko aaazaad kar detii he
 Suddenly in the meantime Sanjay reaches there He does not remember any of them and walks out chasing them
 antatogatva yadav ek bas se takaraa jaataa he or sunita badi mushkil se sanakee sanjay se batch nikalati he
 Knowing that Ghajni is in danger, she informs him that it is Sanjay who is behind his life
 is naam ko lakshya banaakar pataa lagaataa hua gajani sanjay ke flats main uski hatya ke iraade se pahunch jaataa he
 He destroys all her photographs and notes and gets her goons overpowered by Sanjay and re-inducts her on her existing tattoo so that all the marks that mark old memories are erased
 All traces connecting with old memories of being restless have been erased, leaving Gajni Sanjay in this condition
 is bich, chatravaas main lautakar sunita 2006 kii diary padhati he
 The film's story then returns to the pre-2006 scene
 aisa dikhaaya jaataa he ki kalpana ne sanjay ke vivaah prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya tha
 This diary also ends abruptly
 sunita or aage chaanbin kar pataa lagaati he or yah khoj nikaalati he ki 2006 main kisi padaav par kalpana anjaane main anachaahe hi veshyavriti karwaane waalon ke bure jaal main ulajh gai thi
 During the train journey, he met 25 innocent Bholi Bhali Kamsin girls who were being sent to Mumbai for business
 vah un ladakiyon kii raksha kar unka uddhaar karti he
 But the girls take Ghajni's name as gang gangsters
 gajani apane tareeke se apane madhyamon kaa prayog ladakiyon kii jubaan band karne ke liye karata he or kalpana ko khud khoj nikalne ke liye nikal padataa he
 Ghazni and his goons sabotage into Kalpana's apartment and wait for her to return while Kalpana is found inside
 sanyogvash, sanjay vahaan kalpana se milane pahunch gaya
 Kalpana's last pronounced word was "ghajini"
 The goons attacked Kalpana
 sanjay hastkshep karne hi vaala tha ki achaanak gajani ne lohe kii chad se uske sir par aghat kar diya
 The final scene flashes in front of Sanjay's eyes, that Kalpana was killed by the brutal assault of Ghazni's iron rod
 sunita ko ab sadma vaali sachai kaa pataa chal jaataa he, vah sanjay se mulaaqaat karti he or use bataati he ki sach kya he
 Uncontrollable with anger, he pursues Ghazni zealously
 mumbai main gajani kii maand main pahunchakar sanjay gajani ke sabhi anuchar gurgon ko ek-ek kar baqayada suniyojit dhang se krurtapurvak maar daalata he or gajani ke peeche pil padataa he
 Furiously repulsed, he approaches her and confronts the fight
 vah gajani ko maarna hi chahta he ki uskaa smriti lop chakra phir gum jaataa he or vah vartmaan ko bhul jaataa he
 Ghazni turns and stabs him
 vah sanjay kaa mazaaq udaate hue vibhats ghinauni kahani sunaata he ki usne kaise kalpana kii hatya kii thi, tabhi achaanak apni takat kaa antim ubaal paakar sanjay gajani ko kaabo main kar letaa he
 Sanjay kills Ghazni in the same way that Ghajni murdered Kalpana
 film apni samaapti kii ore badhati he, sanjay abhi bhi apni smriti-lop kii beemaari se grasit ek anathalay main swanyasevak ke rup main kaam kar rahaa he
 Sunita gives him a small gift that marks Sanjay and Kalpana's footsteps on the plaster plate when they entered a new apartment - only to remind him of his intimate companionship with Kalpana

 jab is ilaake main sikandar mahaan kii jeet hui to in parvaton ko unani bhashaa main 'kaukasosh indikaush' yani 'bhartiya parvat' bulaayaa jane laga
 Later they were named 'hindu Kush', 'hindu Kuh' and 'kuh-e-hindu'
 'kuh' yaa 'koh' kaa matlab to farsi main 'pahaad' hota he lekin 'kush' ke matlab ko lekar vivaad he
 According to Ibn Battuta in 1333 AD, it meant 'to kill'

 Conversely, according to some scholars, 'kush' is simply another form of 'kuh', or a distorted form of 'hindu Kash' or 'hindu Kesh', which means 'border of India'
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki yah 'kaukasosh indikaush' vaale unani naam kaa do hazaar varshon ke baad kaa bigadaa hua rup ho
