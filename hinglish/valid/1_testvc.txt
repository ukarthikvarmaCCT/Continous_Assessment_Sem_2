 The word Orient is derived from Orions, which means that in the Middle Ages, the former was made in the top in many maps, including t and o maps
 vartmaan main sabase saamaanya lekin sarvlokik se dur, ek cartographic disha nirdesh he ki uttar disha nakshe ke sheersh par hoti he
 Examples of maps that are not oriented north are: kai nakshe paimaane par banaae jate hai, lekin sabhi nahin, unhen ek anupaat ke rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he jaise kii 1:1 xxrep 4 0 , jiskaa matlab he kii nakshe par kisi bhi ikai kaa 1 maap zameen par usee ikai ke 1 xxrep 4 0 ko bilkul yaa lagbhag mail khaati he
 The scale statement can be taken when the mapped area is as small as neglecting the curvature of the earth, for example in a city planner's city map
 On large areas where the curvature cannot be neglected, we need to find the curvature from the earth's surface to be flat
 It is necessary to use map projections
 mandal ko samtal chapata karne kii asambhaavna kaa taatpary yah he kii kisi bhi nakshaa prakshepan kaa ekasmaan paimaane nahin ho saktaa: zyaadaatar prakshepanon par prakshepan main ek yaa do panktiyon par sahi maan hi praapt kar sakate hai

 Large-scale maps, such as 1: 1 xxrep 4 0 , cover relatively small areas in large expanses and miniature maps, such as 1: 10,000,000, cover large areas, such as nations, continents, and the whole world
 Numerical fractions were started with the practice of writing as a scale: 1 / 1 xxrep 7 0 to 1 / 1 xxrep 4 0 larger
 bade or chote ke bich main koi sateek vibhaajan rekha nahin he lekin 1 / 1 xxrep 5 0 ek madhyam paimaane ke rup main mana ja saktaa he
 Examples of large-scale maps are the production of 1: 25,000 maps for the traveler; On the other hand there are miniature maps for motorists in 1: 250,000 or 1: 1,000,000
 yah pahchaan karnaa mahatvapurn he kii sabase sateek nakshe apane upyogkarta ko ek bada drishy upyogita dene ke liye paimaane main sateekta kii ek nishchit raashi kaa nuqasaan sah lete hai
 For example, the widths of roads and small rivers are exaggerated when they are too narrow to show in the correct scale on the map; That is, they will be finite on a printed map when viewed by eye
 The same applies to a computer map where the pixel is the smallest unit
 ek sankeern dhar kii ek pixel kii chaudaai, maano dikhaaya janaa chahie, bhale hi nakshe paimaane par ho, yah pixel chaudaai kaa ek chota sa ansh hoga

 ek divasiy antarrashtriya ) cricket kii ek style he, jisamen do rashtriya cricket tiimon ke bich prati team 50 over khele jate hai
 Cricket World Cup is played according to this format
 ek divasiy antarrashtriya maichon ko "limited over international )" bhi kaha jaataa he, kyonki rashtriya tiimon ke bich simit over ke cricket match khele jate hai or yadi mausam kii vajah se vyavdhaan utpann hota he to ve hameshaa ek din main samaapt nahin hote
 mahatvapurn ek divasiy antarrashtriya or gharelu maichon main aksar do din kaa samay rakhaa jaataa he, jisame se doosraa din "reserve / arakshit" din hota he, taaki pehle din koi parinaam na nikalne kii sthiti main khel ko samaapt karne ke adhik avasar milen
 The international one-day game developed in the late twentieth century
 pehla ek divasiy match melborn cricket ground par 5 janvari 1971 ko australia or england ke bich khelaa gaya tha
 When the first three days of the third Test match were washed out due to rain, the officials decided to end the match and instead it was decided to play 40 ODI matches per team with six balls per over

 mukhya praaroop main cricket ke niyam lagu hote hai
 However, in a one-day international, each team only bats for a limited number of overs
 ekadivasiy cricket ke shuruaati dinon main aam taur par prati team over sankhya 60 thi, lekin ab ise samaan rup se 50 over tak simit kar diya gaya he
 The game in simple language is as follows: overon kii sankhya main kami ke sthiti main, udhaaharan ke liye kharaab mausam ke kaaran, overon kii sankhya kam ho sakati he
 If for some reason the number of overs played by the team batting in the second innings is different from the team batting in the first innings, the result can be determined by the Duckworth – Lewis method
 dudhia roshni is tarah se lagaai jaati hai ki yah kshetrarakshan karne vaali team ko baadha na pahunchaae tathaa gend ke bhigane kii sthiti main captainon ko maidan par kapadaa rakhane kii anumati di gai he
 The bowling team is bound by the conditions of the fielding ban, according to which, in the event of a catch being taken for a specified number of overs, nine players including two players are required to be in the fielding zone
 paramparaagat rup se, kshetrarakshan pratibandh prayek pari ke pehle 15 overon ke liye lagu hota tha
 The ICC introduced the powerplay rules as new rules for ODI series starting on 30 July 2005 in a 10-month trial period
 powerple niyam ke tahat, kshetrarakshan pratibandh pehle 10 overon ke liye tathaa paanch-paanch overon ke do hisson main lagu hota he
 The team batting since October 2008 decides when to start one of the remaining two powerplays, and the fielding team determines when the second powerplay begins
 pehle powerple ke dauraan, 30 gaj ke daayre ke baahar do se adhik khilaadi khadey nahin kiye ja sakate 
 pehle 10 overon main yah bhi aavashyak he ki kam se kam do kshetrarakshak kaich lapakane kii najdiki sthitiyon main hon
 Regarding the powerplay, the ICC has announced that the captain of the fielding team from 1 October 2007 may choose to keep 3 players outside the 30-yard radius during two powerplays of five overs each
 yah niyam 1 oktober 2007 ko dambula stadium main srilanka va england ke bich khele gaye match main lagu kiya gaya tha
 Sri Lanka won the match by 119 runs
 vartmaan main duusare tathaa tisare, donon powerple ke dauraan 3 khilaadi 30 gaj ke daayre ke baahar khadey hote hai tathaa ek powerple ballebaaji karne vaali team dwaara chunaa jaataa he
 There was also a substitution rule in the test rules, according to which a replacement player was allowed to be involved in any position of the match
 toss se pehle timen apane sthanapann khilaadi ko namit karti thi, jise supersab kaha jaataa tha
 Supersub could bat, bowl, fielding or wicket keeping; The substituted player could not participate further in the game
 ise lagu karne ke chah maheenon main kaaphi had tak yah spasht ho gaya ki toss jeetne vaali team ke liye supersab adhik laabhakaari tha, jisase khel main asantulan paidaa hota tha
 In 2005, several international captains signed a "gentleman's Agreement" to end the rule
 ve aavashyaktaa ke anusaar supersab namit karte rahe, kintu unhen maidan main nahin utaara gaya
 On 15 February 2006, the ICC announced the intention to abolish the supersub rule from 21 March 2006

 The ICC followed this standard in 2009 and used these results to give teams a one-day rating for the four years following the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier Trophy
 toornament ke dauraan afghanistan ne 5wein sthaan par pahunch kar or ek divasiy maichon ke liye paatrata hasil kar us varsh ullekhneey safalataa praapt kii
 Sometimes the ICC has granted permanent one-day status without giving full membership and test status to associate members

 In addition, the ICC has the authority to grant special one-day status to certain high-level tournaments, as a result of which the following countries have also participated in full one-day matches: 2005 main isisi ne pehali baar vivaadaaspad dhang se kai aise maichon ko ekadivasiy darja de diya tha, jiname bhaag lene vaali timen ek se adhik deshon ke khilaadiyon se bani thim
 These matches were: Asia Cricket XI ICC World XI match played in January 2005 as a World Cricket Tsunami Appeal to assist the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami victims and commercially sponsored ICC Super Series held in Melbourne on October 2005 Three matches of "australia vs ICC World XI"
 The subsequent matches had very few spectators, these were largely one-sided matches and they did not attract much attention from the cricket world
 yah ek aisa prayog tha, jo kai logon ke anusaar dobaaraa nahin doharaaya janaa chahie tathaa kai cricket sankhyikeevidon kaa maananaa he ki aise maichon ko aadhikarik ekadivasiy maichon main shaamil nahin kiya janaa chahie

 35 ranon ke saath sabase kam ransankhya kaa record zimbabwe ke naam he jo 2004 main haraare main srilanka ke viruddh bana
 The highest runs scored by both teams in a limited-overs match is 872: Australia scored 434 for four in 50 overs, batting first during their one-day international in Johannesburg in 2006, but still managed to beat South Africa
 Maat ate, scoring 438 runs at the loss of nine wickets with one ball remaining

 These include: iske atirikt, jon tricos ne dakshin africa or zimbabwe ke liye test match khele hai, lekin ekadivasiy match keval zimbabwe ke liye khele hai tathaa govin hemilton ne scotland ke liye keval ekadivasiy match khele hai tathaa ek test match main england kaa pratinidhitiv kiya he

 The reason which remains fixed before the work and is not superimposed is not called the cause
 keval kaary ke purv main rahane se hi kaarantv nahin haata, kaary ke utpaadan main saakshaatkaar sahyogi bhi ise hona chahie
 Elsewhere, those so-called causes are included, which remain before the origin of the work, but are not necessarily useful in the production of the work
 jaise kumhaar kaa pita athwa mitti dhonevaala gadhaa ghat rup kaary ke prati anyathaasiddh he
 The work-cause-relationship is based on interchangeability
 kaaran ke hone par kaary hota he, kaaran ke na hone par kaary nahin hota
 In nature, often the work-cause-relationship is not clear
 ek kaary ke anek kaaran dikhaai dete hai
 We have to find the real reason out of those many visible causes
 iske liye saavdhaanee ke saath ek-ek dikhaai denevaale kaarnon ko hataakar dekhnaa hoga ki kaary utpann hota he yaa nahin
 If a task is generated then the one that has been removed is not the cause
 jo ant main shesh batch rahata he vahiin vaastavik kaaran mana jaataa he
 It has been assumed that this work has only one reason otherwise the authenticity of the presumption will be lost
 yadi dhooma ke anek kaaran hon to dhooma ke dwaara agni kaa anumaan karnaa galat hoga
 Where many reasons are seen, after analyzing the work, it will be known that the noble elements of the work originate from many elements of the cause
 is prakaar vahaan bhi kaarivishesh kaa kaaranvishesh se sambandh sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 It is a mistake to assume that a group of functions is generated from a group of factors
 vastav main samooh rup main anek kaaranvishesh samooharup main kaary ko utpann nahin karte
 They are due to different functionalities
 kaary ke purv main niyat rup se rahanaa do tarah kaa ho saktaa he
 The reason remains before the production of the work, but a separation arises from that cause of the work
 kaaran keval naveen kaary ke utpaadan main sahakaari rahata he
 Soil is made from pitcher, so clay is the reason for pitcher and also the potter who gives mud to pot
 kumhaar ke vyapaar ke purv mitti mitti he or ghade ko koi astitv nahin he
 The pot is born with the help of the potter, so the pitcher is a new work which was never there before
 is siddhant ko aarambhvaad kehete hai
 Reason is the initiator of new work, reason does not transform itself into work
 yadhyapi kaary ke utpaadan main mitti, kumhaar, chaak aadi vastuen sahaayak hoti hai parantu ye sab alag-alag kaary nahin hai or na to ye sab sammilit rup main gadaa in sabake sahyog se utpann parantu in sabase vilakshan apurv uplabdhi he
 Organisms are separate entities from components; On the basis of this principle, initialism is enforced
 bhartiya darshan main nyayavaisheshik is siddhant ke samarthak hai
 The relation of cause to work can also be seen from another point of view
 mitti se gadaa banataa he at: gadaa avyakt rup main vidyaman he
 If there is no soil, since the pitcher does not have latent state, the pitcher does not arise
 vastuvishesh kii kaarivishesh ke kaaran ho sakate hai
 If the work is a new entity other than the reason, then an object can arise for some reason
 til kii jagah baaluu se tel nahin nikalataa kyonki prakruti main ek satta kaa niyam kaam kar rahaa he
 Power is born from power
 asat se sat kii utpatti nahin ho sakati—yah prakruti ke niyam se vipareet hoga
 This principle of Samkhya Yoga is called consequentialism
 iske anusaar kaaran kaary ke rup main parinat hota he, at: tatvat: kaaran kaary se pruthak nahin he
 Unlike these two opinions, there is one other opinion which neither considers the cause as the initiator nor the resultant
 kaaran vyaparrahit satta he
 There is no trade for the origin of work in it
 kaaran kutasth tatv he
 But work is produced in spite of embodiment
 kaaran kutasth tatv he
 But in spite of embodiment, work arises because the observer does not see the koothasta in its pure form due to external titles such as ignorance
 jaise bhram kii dasha main rassi kii jagah sarp kaa gyaan hota he, vaise hi kaaran kii jagah kaary dikhaai padataa he
 Therefore, the distinction of causal work is not an elemental distinction
 yah bhed aupchaarik he
 This view, which is accepted in Advaita Vedanta, is called Vivartavada
 aarambhvaad main kaary kaaran pruthak hai, parinamwad main unamem tathvik bhed na hote hue bhi avyakt-vyakt-avasthaa kaa bhed mana jaataa he, parantu vivartvaad main na to unamem tathvik bhed he or na avasthaa kaa
 The distinction of reason is confusing, and the work that is confused with illusion is virtually untrue
 jab tak drushti dooshit he tabhi vah vyaavhaarik dasha main ve donon pruthak dikhaai dete hai
 As soon as the vision is merged, the merger of work and the knowledge of pure form of reason arise
 kaaran kii teen vidhaayen maani gai hai
 Gratitude is the reason in which work arises out of a cohesive relationship
 arthath vah vastu jo kaary ke sharir kaa nirmaan karti he, upadan kahalati he
 Soil pitches or fresh clothes are the cause of the matter
 isi ko samavayi kaaran bhi kehete hai
 Asymptotic reason is the help in the origin of work by staying in a synonymous cause
 taage kaa rang, taage main, jo kapade kaa samavayi kaaran he at: taage kaa rang kapade kaa asamavaayi kaaran kaha jaataa he
 Isomeric cause is matter, but non-causal is a property or action form
 nimitt kaaran samavayi kaaran main gati utpann karata he jisase kaary kii utpatti hoti he
 The potter is the instrument for the pitcher because he builds the pitcher from the grain
 samavayi or asamavaayi se bhinn anyathaasiddhashunya sabhi kaaran nimitt kaaran kahe jate hai
 According to Aristotle, there is also the fourth mode of reason, which is called the sponsor cause
 jis uddeshy se kaary kaa nirmaan hota he vah uddeshy bhi kaary kaa kaaran hota he
 a pitcher is built to hold water, so that purpose is the sponsor cause of the pitcher
 is chauthi vidha kaa nimitt main hi samavesh ho saktaa he
 Initialism's theory about reason gives importance to reason
 kisi uddeshy kii purti ke liye kaary kaa nirmaan hota he, yadi vah uddeshysthit vastuon se purna ho jaae to kaary kii aavashyaktaa hi na rahegi
 Therefore, there is a situation of separate work from the instrument and for its fulfillment, the instrument gives speed to the gratuity

 astu
 1
 Just as gem is not found on all mountains, pearl is not produced in the head of all elephants, sandalwood tree is not present in all forests, similarly gentle men are not found in all places
 2
 jhooth bolnaa, utavlaapan dikhaanaa, dussahas karnaa, chal-kapat karnaa, moorkhtapurna kaary karnaa, lobh karnaa, apavitrataa or nirdayata - ye sabhi striyon ke swaabhaavik dosha hai
 Chanakya considers the above mentioned doshas as natural qualities of women
 haalaanki vartmaan daur kii shikshit striyon main in dosha kaa hona sahi nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 3
 The availability of good substances for food, the power to digest them, the work force for contact with a beautiful woman, the desire to give abundant wealth as well as wealth
 ye sabhi sukh manushya ko bahut kathinata se praapt hote hai
 4
 Chanakya says that the person whose son is under his control, whose wife conducts according to the command and the person who is fully satisfied with his earned money
 aise manushya ke liye yah sansar hi swarg ke samaan he
 5
 Chanakya believes that the same householder is happy, whose children obey their orders
 pita kaa bhi karttavya he ki vah putron kaa paalan-poshan acchhee tarah se kare
 In the same way, such a person cannot be called a friend, who cannot be trusted and such a wife is meaningless who does not get any kind of pleasure
 6
 jo mitra aapke saamne chikani-chupadi baaten karata ho or peeth peeche aapke kaary ko bigaad detaa ho, use tyaag dene main hi bhalaai he
 Chanakya says that he is like a pot that has milk on its top but has poison inside
 7
 chanakya kehete hai ki jo vyakti acha mitra nahin he us par to vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie, parantu iske saath hi achche mitra ke sambandh main bhi puraa vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie, kyonki yadi vah naaraaz ho gaya to aapke saare bhed khol saktaa he
 Therefore, caution is very important
 8
 chanakya kaa maananaa he ki vyakti ko kabhi apane man kaa bhed nahin kholana chahie
 Whatever work he has to do, keep it in his mind and he should complete it with full patience when the time comes
 9
 chanakya kaa kahana he ki morrkhtaa ke samaan yauvan bhi dukhadaayi hota he kyonki javaani main vyakti kamvasana ke aaveg main koi bhi moorkhtapurna kaary kar saktaa he
 But even more painful than these is to depend on others
 10
 chanakya kehete hai ki bachapan main santan ko jaisi shiksha di jaati he, unka vikaas usee prakaar hota he
 Therefore, it is the duty of the parents to lead them on such a path that they develop the best character because only the virtues of the family are enhanced by the virtuous ones
 11
 ve mata-pita apane bacchon ke liye shatru ke samaan hai, jinhone bacchon ko acchhee shiksha nahin di
 Because the illiterate child is insulted in the group of scholars in the same way as the heron in the herd of swans
 shiksha viheen manushya bina punch ke jaanavar jaisaa hota he, isliye mata-pita kaa kartavya he ki ve bacchon ko aisi shiksha den jisase ve samaaj ko sushobhit karen
 12
 Chanakya says that many pampering in children leads to many defects
 isliye yadi ve koi galat kaam karte hai to use nazarandaaj karke laad-pyaar karnaa uchit nahin he
 It is also necessary to scold the child
 13
 shiksha or adhyayan kii mahatta bataate hue chanakya kehete hai ki manushya kaa janm bahut saubhaahgya se miltaa he, isliye hamen apane adhikadhik samay kaa vedadi shastron ke adhyayan main tathaa daan jaise achche kaaryon main hi sadupyog karnaa chahie
 14
 Just as the grief of the wife's separation, the sorrow of the insult received from her siblings is unbearable, similarly the debt-ridden person remains unhappy at all times
 dusht raja kii seva main rahane vaala naukar bhi dukhi rahata he
 Man can never forget the curse of poverty
 inase vyakti kii aatma andar hi andar jalati rahati he
 15
 According to Chanakya, the life of the trees situated on the banks of the river is uncertain, because the rivers devastate the trees along the banks at the time of flood
 isi prakaar duusare ke gharon main rahane vaali stri bhi kisi samay patan ke maarg par ja sakati he
 Similarly, a king who does not have a minister to give good advice, he cannot remain safe for a long time
 isamen jaraa bhi andeh nahin karnaa chahie
 16
 Chanakya says that the way the prostitute turns away from the man at the end of the money
 usee tarah jab raja shaktiheen ho jaataa he to praja uskaa saath chhod detii he
 Similarly, birds living on trees also live on a tree as long as they get fruits from there
 atithi kaa jab puraa swaagat-satkar kar diya jaataa he to vah bhi us ghar ko chhod detaa he
 17
 The man who befriends a person with bad character, causing harm to others and living in an unclean place, is soon destroyed
 acharya chanakya kaa kahana he manushya ko kusangati se bachanaa chahie
 They say that it is in the good of man to leave the wicked person as soon as possible
 18
 chanakya kehete hai ki mitrataa, barabari vaale vyaktiyon main hi karnaa thik rahata he
 Government jobs are the best and for good business it is necessary to be efficient
 isi tarah sundar va susheel stri ghar main hi shobhaa detii he
 Chanakya used to live in a hut in the jungle
 vahaan anek log unase paraamarsh or gyaan praapt karne ke liye aate the
 The forest in which he lived was full of stones and thorn bushes
 chunki us samay praaia: nange pair rahane kaa hi chalan tha, isliye unke nivas tak pahunchane main logon ko anek kashton kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 On reaching there, the feet of the people used to bled
 ek din kuch log us maarg se behad pareshaaniyon kaa saamana kar chanakya tak pahunche
 One person said while pleading with them, 'we were very sorry to reach you
 aap maharaj se kahkar yahaan kii jameen ko chamade se dhakwane kii vyavastha kara den
 This will make people comfortable
 ’ uski baat sunakar chanakya muskaraate hue bole, ‘mahashay, keval yaheen chamada bichaane se samasya hal nahin hogi
 The thorny and rocky paths are countless in this world
 aise main puure vishwa main chamada bichawana to asambhav he
 Yes, if you protect your feet with leather, then you can definitely avoid the wrath of stony paths and thorny bushes
 ’ vah vyakti sir jhukaakar bolaa, ‘haa guruji, main ab aisa hi karuunga
 ' iske baad chanakya bole, ‘dekho, meri is baat ke peeche bhi gaharaa saar he
 Instead of trying to improve others, improve yourself
 isse tum apane kaary main vijay avashya hasil kar loge
 The person who advises the world is unable to do anything, while his self-follower reaches the heights of success
 ’ is baat se sabhi sahamat ho gaye Amatya Acharya Chanakya of Pataliputra, being a very scholarly justiceist, was also a straightforward honest gentleman
 ve itane bade samrajya ke mahaamantri hone ke baavjood chappar se dhaki kutiyaa main rahete the
 He had a living like a common man
 ek baar yunaan kaa rajdoot unase milane raaj darbar main pahunchaa raajnneeti or kutanay main daksh chanakya kii charchaa sunakar rajdoot mantrmugdh ho gaya
 The ambassador asked for an appointment with Chanakya in the evening
 acharya ne kaha-aap raat ko mere ghar aa sakate hai
 The Ambassador was pleased with Chanakya's behavior
 shaam ko jab vah rajmahal parisar main ’amatya nivas‘ ke bare main poochne laga
 Raj Prahari said - Acharya Chanakya lives outside the city
 rajdoot ne sochaa shaayad mahaamantri kaa nagar ke baahar sarovar par bana sundar mahal hoga
 The ambassador arrived outside the city
 ek naagarik se poocha ki chanakya kaha rahete hai
 Pointing towards a hut, the citizen said - See, she is the hut of the General Secretary
 rajdoot aashcharya chakit rah gaya
 After reaching the hut, he touched Chanakya's feet and complained - a shrewd general minister like you lives in a hut
 chanakya ne kaha-agar main janata kii kadi mehnat or paseene kii kamai se bane mehalon se rahoonga to mere desh ke naagarik ko kutiyaa bhi naseeb nahin hogi
 The Greek ambassador bowed down on Chanakya's honesty
