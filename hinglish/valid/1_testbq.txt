 Local resident Shashi Ranjan Chaudhary explains, “gutkha sales have also been banned in village shops
 iske alaava gaanv main kisi tyohaar par deje bajaane par bhi pratibandh he
 The villagers themselves are keeping an eye on the violators of these decisions

 However the deal did not happen and NDTV cannot verify the authenticity of these documents at its own level
 dilli police ke kamishnar niraj kumaar ne enditivi se kaha ki agast, 2009 main jab tathakthith saude par hastakshar hue, us vakt vah ek senior adhikari ke rup main prashasan or suraksha ke incharge the or augusta westland ke saath kisi saude par vichaar nahin kiya gaya
 This 'internal agreement', effectively an advisory agreement, is signed by Augusta Westland chief Bruno Spagnolini, who is under house arrest in Italy for the VVIP helicopter deal
 is engrement main neuyork aadhaarit ganton limited company ko helicopteron kii bikri ke liye aath pratishat or kal-purjon ke liye 15 pratishat kamishan ke prastaav kaa zikr he
 Abhishek Verma, who works as a representative of this company, is in jail on charges of disputed arms deal

 ganton ke adhyaksh edmund ellen pichley saal kii shuruyaat se bharat sarkaar ko abhishek verma ke avaidh or bhrasht karnaamon ke bare main chitthee likhte rahe hai
 Verma was once Ellen's business associate
 ganton or augusta westland ne philhal is bare main tippanee karne ke aagrah par koi pratikriya nahin di he
 The government says that since this deal did not come into effect, there is no possibility of any other scam related to Augusta Westland or its helicopters
 lekin agar ye dastavej pramanik hai to yah saaf taur par jaahir karata he ki desh main jahaan raksha saudon ko bina bichauliye or bina kamishan ke aadhaar par kiya janaa chahie, vahiin ye saude kai baar nijee partiyon ke bich aghoshit samjhaute ke ird-gird bhi ghoomte rahete hai
 Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar told NDTV that he was in charge of administration and security as a senior officer when the so-called deal was signed in August 2009 and no deal with Augusta Westland was considered
 is 'internal engrement', prabhavi rup se ek salaahkaariya samjhaute par augusta westland ke pramukh bruno spganolini ke hastakshar hai, jo viviipi helicopter saude ko lekar italy main najarband hai
 The agreement refers to a proposal of a commission of eight percent for the sale of helicopters to the New York-based Ganton Limited Company and 15 percent for components
 is company ke pratinidhi ke rup main kaam karne vaale abhishek verma hathiyaaron ke vivaadit saude ke aarope main jail main hai
 The comments dastavej ke mutabik kamishan tabhi lagu hota, jab antim rup se sauda tay ho jaataa
 Ganton president Edmund Allen has been writing to the Indian government since early last year about the illegal and corrupt exploits of Abhishek Verma
 verma kabhi ellen ke bijness sahyogi the
 Ganton and Augusta Westland have not yet responded to requests for comment
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki chunki yah deal amal main ai hi nahin, isliye augusta westland yaa iske helicopteron ko lekar duusare kisi ghotaale kii ashanka nahin he
 But if these documents are authentic, then it clearly shows that in the country where defense deals should be done without intermediary and without commission, these deals sometimes revolve around unannounced agreements between private parties

 After liberalization, India has witnessed several booming morals on the issue of sexuality
 naitikta se judi yah ghabrahat pahanaave, shaadi se pehle sex ko lekar yaa kisi or masale ke bare main ho sakati hai
 On all these matters, the lines of worry about adolescent girls and young people are clearly visible
 yuvaaon or unki kaamuktha ko lekar bhi ashankaayen kuch kam nahin hai
 When it comes to apprehensions related to morality, the mind is in the opposite directions of yes-or-no: innocence is considered the opposite of knowledge and innocence is also considered the opposite of wildness (that is why our children We should never look 'wildly' — whatever its meaning is — while partying, even we should not be seen having fun)
 masti kii talash ko aksar aiyashi ke baraabar maan liya jaataa he or jab baat laalan-paalan kii ho, tab to yah nishchit rup se garajammedaarana maani jaati he
 Since lack of information is similar to maintaining innocence, our children should never be told about sexual behavior
 natijatan aksar ve agyantapurna faisle karne ke liye majaboor hote hai
 In many states of India, sex education is not allowed in schools
 sibiesai se sambhddha skulon main chhathvin kaksha ke baad yon shiksha shuru karne ke maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke faisle ke jawaab main skulon main yon shiksha shuru karne ke mudde par rashtriya bahes kii maang karne vaali ek yachika par 2009 main rajyasabha kii sansadeey samiti ne apni report taiyaar kii
 "this message should be conveyed appropriately to school children that there should be no sex before marriage, which is unethical, inappropriate and unhealthy," the report said
 '' unhone sujhav diya ki sex ke bare main koi shiksha nahin di jaani chahie, lekin ve jeev vigyaan ke paathyakram main samuchit adhyay shaamil karne ke liye taiyaar the, vah bhi plus-tu se pehle nahin
 In addition, chapters such as 'physical and mental development in adolescence' and 'HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases' were to be removed from the existing syllabus and added to 10 + 2 in biology books
 tajjub kii baat nahin ki sex shiksha ke abhaav kaa matlab sex kaa abhaav nahin hota
 But it means less informed, less responsible, and sometimes less respectful or less faith-based sex
 maine kuch saal pehle mumbai ke ek college main langikta or uske nirupan (yon shiksha nahin) par ek kaaryshaala yojit karaane main madad kii thi
 My intention was to describe the power equation within which sex is situated, but i found that instead i understood middle and upper middle-class 18-20 year old girls in it as basic processes like menstruation, pregnancy and pregnancy
 yah is baat kaa saboot he ki unhen kitni kam jaankaree uplabdh he
 The India Today survey suggests that parents do not talk about sex with their children - safe sex is even less
 sampark kiye gaye maatr 10 fisadi logon ne surakshit sex ke bare me apane bacchon ke saath baat kii
 78 percent do not openly talk about sex
 chaahe yah hamen pasand ho yaa naapsand, yuva log sex ke bare main sochate hai or kai baar ve sex ke saath prayog karte hai
 We just need to provide them with the means by which they can do it responsibly and safely
 yakeenan, ham main se koi nahin chahega ki unka 12 saal kaa baccha sex kare, lekin yah to ham isse bhi kam chahenge ki usee 12 varsh ke bachche ko gupt (sex sanchari) rog ho jaae-yaa vah ek asahaj or isse bhi bure jabaran kiye gaye sex anubhav ke saath laute
 Sex education is not just about sex
 isamen sirf jeevigyaan or surakshit sex kaa nahin balki rishton or jimmedaari kaa bhi bodh karaayaa janaa chahie
 Young women talked about contraceptives about how difficult it was for them to persuade them to use condoms
 ve khud condom muhaiyaa nahin kara sakati thim kyonki isse unhen sex ke bare main bahut jaankaar maane jane kaa andeshaa tha
 In such a situation, young women were willing to risk latent diseases and possible unwanted pregnancies, but they were expected to be impure and thus damage their reputation
 sex shiksha ke jariye samakaleen sambandhon main in chintaaon ko dur karne kii jarurat he
 If parents are hesitant to show affection in front of their children — as the survey suggests, only 15 per cent are able to do so — then overall this is not surprising

" yahaan tak ki dilli hycourt ne bhi ek hi ling ke logon ke bich sahmati se or ekant main banaae gaye sambandhon ko 2009 main aparadhmukt kar diya
 But an India Today poll suggests that 74 percent of people will find it difficult to accept a child whose sexuality is different from theirs
 jab main zyada choti bacchee bhi nahin thi, to ham log dark room naam kaa ek khel khelte the, jo luka-chhipi ke khel jaisaa tha, lekin andhere main khelaa jaataa tha
 But the Dark Room was much more fun because it seemed devilish and often a bit wild - with screams, loud screams and dark sheets clutched with hands searching the body
 or andhera to jagah or vakt ke lihaaj se har tarah kii sambhaavnaaon kii khadaan hota he-achaanak kismat se kuch haath lag jane kaa mauka, or phir uske kaamuk arth-anarth
 We were so small that we should be called a child, but we were also big enough to understand the things that older people did not tell us
 yahi vajah he ki jab india today kaa surveykshan bataata he ki raay dene vaale aadhe se zyada log apane bacchon ko apni 'wild' partiyon main shaamil hone kii ijaajat nahin dete, to sawaal uthta he-kyon
 'wild' parties often mean the place where the liquor is served, dancing (some of it may be unabashed) and there is scope for people to wince
 isamen kahkahe, jor kii chikhen sun sakate hai or logon ko mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 You could say — this is the adult version of the Dark Room
 iske baavjood wild partiyon ko aise sthanon ke taur par nahin pesh kiya jaataa, jahaan aap sirf masti kar sakav, balki avaidh or sandigdh sthaan ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he
 For example, filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar, who portrays middle-class morality, indicates in Page Three (2005) that 'partybats' are superficial, hollow and, among other things, child sexual abuse
 ve fishan (2008) main bataate hai ki 'wild' partiyon ke glamer kii duniya ke log gumraah logon se khaas alag nahin hote
 That's when women finally get in bed with the wrong people
 jab wild or sex ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, to yah zyaadaatar logon ko asahaj banane kii pravriti rakhata he
 Add enjoyment to this mixture and you will get a lot of spiciness
 aise main zyaadaatar logon ke liye masti kii tarafdaari karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Even advocates of sex education begin to argue that this will provide controlled knowledge to the youth, reduce pregnancy at a young age and in fact they will be active late in the matter of sex
 surakshit sex ke tareekon ke bare main padhaate vakt kya yah mumkin he ki aisi sthiti aa jaae jab hamen anand yaa mouj-masti kii bhi charchaa kerani pade?sex kii hamaari shabdaawalee main do tarah ke shabd aksar gaayab rahete hai or ve shabd hamen apane or apane bacchon ke liye hamaari soch ko spasht karne ke liye jaruri hai: rajamandi or masti or doosraa he sammaan or vishwaas
 If we can look at sex and sexuality from the point of view of consent and fun, then we might be interested in the ethical aspects of sex, safe sex, conversations about sex, preferences in sex, and indeed wild parties or even wild sex Instead of thinking about, ask yourself different kinds of questions
 tab ham khud se puch sakate hai ki shaamil rahe har vyakti kii rajamandi thi or kya unako majaa aayaa?lekhika mumbai sthit tata institute of soshal sciensej ke centre for media studies main padhaati hai

 congress netaa ne jaise immergency ke baad indira gandhi ne logon se maafee maangi thi thik usee tarah bina shart pradhanmantri narendra modi desh maafee maangen
