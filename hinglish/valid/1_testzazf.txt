 vaayu sena •gaalib •rashtriya sangrahalay •rashtriya prakritik itihaas •rashtriya dak tikat •police •rail•shankar anterrashtriya gudiya sangrahalay •aadhunik kala •shilp sangrahalay • Emergency management is the generic name for an interdisciplinary field that deals with the strategic organizational management processes used to protect an organization's critical assets from hazardous risks posing a disaster or disaster and to ensure their continuity over a planned lifetime
 aastiyaan sajiv, nirjeev, saanskrithik yaa aarthik ke rup main vargeekrut hai
 Hazards are classified by natural or man-made causes
 prakriyaaon kii pahchaan ke uddeshy se sampurna samrik prabandhan kii prakriya ko chaar kshetron main baanta gaya he
 These four areas are generally concerned with risk mitigation, preparing resources to counter the threat, responding to the actual damage caused by the hazard, and limiting further damage and returning to the situation as closely as possible to the event of the threat 
 kshetra saarvajanik or nijee donon main hota he, prakriya ek si sanjhi hoti he lekin dhyaan centre vibhinn hote hai
 The emergency management process is a strategic process rather than a policy process, so it is usually limited to the executive level in the organization
 saamaanya rup se isaki koi pratyaksh shakti nahin he lekin yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki ek sanghathan ke sabhi bhaag ek saanjhe lakshya par dhyaan kendrit karen, yah salaahkaar ke rup main yaa kaaryon ke samanvay ke liye kaary karata he
 Effective emergency management depends on the overall integration of emergency plans at all levels of the organization and the understanding that the lowest levels of the organization are responsible for managing emergencies and receiving additional resources and support from the upper levels
 kaarykram kaa sanchaalan karne vaale sanghathan ke sabase varisht vyakti ko saamaanya rup se ek apatkaaleen prabandhak yaa kshetra main prayukt shabd se vyutpann par aadhaarit kaha jaataa he
 Areas covered under this definition are: prabandhan kii prakruti sthaneey aarthik or saamaajik sthiti par nirbhar karti he
 Some disaster relief experts, such as Fred Knee, have noted that in a way the only real disaster is economic
 kani jaise visheshgyon ne bahut pehle note kiya ki apatkaaleen prabandhan chakra main buniyadi dhaanche, saarvajanik jaagrukta or yahan tak ki maanav nyaay ke muddon par dirghakaalik kaam ko shaamil karnaa chahie
 The process of emergency management has four stages: mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery
 haal hi main homeland security vibhaag or femaa ne EM ke pratimaan ke bhaag ke rup main "samutthan" or "rokthaam" shabdon ko apanaaya he
 The second term was enacted by PKEMA 2006 into law by the Act in October 2006 and has come into effect from 31 March 2007
 donon shabdon kii paribhaashaayen alag charnon ke rup main saralata se upyukt nahin hoti he
 Prevention is 100% mitigation by definition
 samutthan chaar charnon ke lakshya kaa varnan karata he: durbhaagya se aasaani se ubarne yaa parivartan se taal-mail bithaane kii kshamta Mitigation action is an attempt to reduce the impact of disasters in the event that hazards are prevented or occur in disaster
 newnikaran charan anya charnon se bhinn he kyonki yah jokhim ko kam karne yaa nasht karne ke liye dirghakaalin upayon par kendrit hota he
 Implementation of mitigation strategies can be considered part of the recovery process if implemented after a disaster occurs
 newnikaran upaay sanrachanaatmak yaa gaiyr-sanrachanaatmak ho sakate hai
 Structural measures use technical solutions like flood dams
 gaiyr-sanrachanaatmak upayon main shaamil hai kanoon, bhoomi-upyog yojana or beemaa
 khataron ke prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye newnikaran sabase adhik laagat prabhavi tarika he lekin yah hameshaa upyukt nahin hota
 Mitigation includes arranging regulations regarding evacuation, imposing sanctions against those who oppose compliance with regulations, and informing the public of potential risks
 Some structural mitigation measures may adversely affect the ecosystem
 newnikaran kii purvavarti gatividhi jokhim kii pahchaan he
 Physical risk assessment refers to the process of identifying and evaluating hazards
 khatra-vishesh jokhim kisi vishisht khatre kii sambhaavna or prabhaav ke str donon ko jodta he
 According to the following equation, multiplying the risk and the vulnerability of the population to that hazard produces risk catastrophe modeling
 jitna ucch jokhim utana adhik zaruri he ki khatra vishisht arakshittaayen newnikaran or tatparta ke prayaason se lakshith hai
 However, vulnerability is not a threat, for example earthquakes occurring in uninhabited deserts
 prakritik aapadaaon, aatankwaadi krityon or anya maanav nirmit aapadaaon kii rokthaam or inase suraksha, pratyuttar, ubarne or prabhaavon ko kam karne ke liye prabhavi samanvay or kshamtaaon main vruddhi sunishchit karne ke liye yojana, aayojan, prashikshan, las karnaa, abhyaas, moolyankan or sudhaar gatividhiyon kaa satat chakra tatparta he
 In the readiness phase, emergency managers plan a course of action to manage and cope with risk and take the necessary actions to build the capabilities necessary to implement such plans
 aam tatparta upayon main shaamil hai: Another aspect of preparedness is casualty prediction, studying the number of anticipated deaths or injuries from a single incident
 isse yojanakaaron ko anumaan ho jaataa he ki kisi vishesh prakaar kii ghatana ke pratyuttar main kya kya sansaadhan taiyaar hone chahie
 Emergency managers must be flexible and comprehensive in the planning phase - they carefully identify risks and vulnerabilities in their respective areas and employ unconventional and unusual means of support
 nagar nigam, yaa nijee - kshetra ke anusaar apatkaaleen sevaaon ko kam kiya ja saktaa he yaa baari kar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Desired resources provided by ngos such as transportation of displaced homeowners by local district school buses, execution of flood victims by mutual collaborative agreements between fire departments and rescue squads, should be identified in planning stages and regularly These should be practiced together

 They can be supported by a number of secondary emergency services such as specialist rescue teams
 ek acchhee tarah se dohraayi gayi apatkaaleen yojana ko tatparta charan ke bhaag ke rup main viksit karne se bachaav kaa kushal samanvayan hota he
 When needed, search and rescue can be initiated at the initial stage of effort
 ghayalon ke jakhm, bahari taapmaana, peediton ko hawa or pani kii sulabhta ke drushtigat aapadaa ke adhikansh shikaar sanghaat ke baad 72 ghante ke bheetar mar jaaenge
 Organizational response to any serious disaster - natural or terrorist-caused - is based on existing emergency management organizational systems and processes: the Federal Response Plan and the Incident Command System
 in pranaaliyon ko ekikrut kaman or aapasi sahaayta ke siddhanton ke madhyam se shashakt kiya jaataa he
 Responding to any disaster requires both discipline and agility

 This allows the team to move forward with coordinated, disciplined responses that are more or less correct and adapt to new information and changing circumstances
 ubarne vaale charan kaa uddeshy prabhavit kshetra ko yathapurv sthiti main behaal karnaa he
 Its goal is different from the response phase, the recovery efforts are related to issues and decisions that must be made after the immediate needs are met
 ubarne ke prayaas mukhya rup se nasht sampatti, punarrozgaar or anya aavashyak buniyadi dhaanche kii marammat sambandhi kaary hai
 Efforts should be made to "improve back" with the aim of reducing pre-disaster risk in the community and infrastructure

 america main ubarne ke prayaason main atyaadhik takneekee or vittiya sahaayta adhiktar sangheey sarkaar dwaara pradaan kii jaati he
 Knowing and avoiding unnecessary risk is primarily personal mitigation
 nijee / paariwarik swasthya or nijee sampatti ko sambhav jokhim kaa moolyankan isamen shaamil he
 An example of mitigation would be not to buy property in hazardous areas such as flood plains, concave or landslide areas
 The homeowner may not be aware of the danger to the property until it happens

 This assistance may be provided by national or international agencies and organizations
 aapadaa sahaayta kaa prabhavi samanvayan aksar mahatvapurn hota he, khaskar jab anek sanghathan jawaab den or sthaneey apatkaaleen prabandhan agency kii kshamta zarurat se pare yaa aapadaa ke kaaran kam ho gai ho
 On a personal level the response may take the form of shelter or evacuation at some place

 chaturth sarg main, sujatha se vaartalap karte hue uddalak kehete hai ki–yah dharna ki viklang parivaar par bhaar hai or upekshniya hai –vishwa kaa sarvanaash kar degi
 He warns against disrespect and reproach of the disabled and advises them to treat them with respect, otherwise the teardrops of the disabled can punish those who suffer them like thunderbolt
 saptam sarg main, ashtavakra ke swagatakathan main, kavi kehete hai ki viklangon ko hasya kaa paatr bananaa kadaapi samichin nahin he, kyonki ve bhi usee shilpi kii kriti hai, jisane sampoorn sristi kaa srijan kiya he
 a verse is given as an example: bhaar he viklang kya parivaar kaa kya upekshya paatr vah sakalang kaa
 This odd concept will make the world fall into disrepute
 mahakavy ke pradhan ras vir evam karun ras hai
 Ashtavakra's autobiography after his father's curse, the repentance after Kahola's curse, and the conversation between Uddhalak and Sujata after Kahola was submerged - are full of compassion and compassion
 ashtavakra kaa apane pita ko mukt karaane kaa drudhnishchay or sankalp or unki mithila yatra vir ras se paripurna ullekhneey prasang hai
 Yamaka is an ornament in Sanskrit where a word is used multiple times and each word has a different meaning
 mahakavy main yamak mishrit anupras alankaar kaa ek udhaaharan 7
32 padya ke dwitiya ardhansh main is prakaar he – Lalitlalam Vibhushan Bhavabhushan Bhusabhushan Ripudushan Dushan Nimikul Bhushan was dying on a limb
 padya 1
21 ke dwitiya ardhansh main, kavi “raurav” evam “gaurav” shabdon kaa prayog ek hi pankti main kramshah chaar or teen baar karte hai, jinamein prayek baar unka bhinn-bhinn arth he
 Jaurarava, who was proud of Raurava, without pride, was a proud pride, a proud Shritgaurva
 mahakavy main anek sthalon par, kavi bhashasmak alankaar kaa prayog karte hai, jahaan sanskrit tathaa hindi ek saath mishrit ho gai hai
 An example of this type of verse, in which the name Sujata is derived on the basis of Nirukta, is presented here: subhago jato yasyah saiv sujatha naam nirukti yahi ashtavakra subhag jataka kii bani sujatha maatu sahi 
 Under the Mudra ornamentation, the verse used for the composition of the verse - by mentioning its name in the verse - is indicated
 ashtavakra mahakavy ke tritiy sarg kaa antim padya “shardoolavicreedit” chand main rachit he or isamen “shardoolavicriditam” shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Ashtavakra Maharishi is saying the sentence as it was silent as soon as Bipra Kahola's nayan also became neerendharvashi simantonnayaneey vedavidhi bhi sampann praayah hui gaayen dev sabhi kaholsut kaa shardoolavicriditam 
 In his Sanskrit epic Sribhargavaraghaviyam, poet Rambhadracharya has used this figure of speech at eight places
 mahakavy ke saatven or aathven sarg main chaar vaartalap varnit hai
 In this, the first conversation takes place between Ashtavakra and Raja Janak and presents the fast and confidence of Ashtavakra
 shesh teen vaartalapon main ashtavakra kii vidwata ko pramanit karne vaale vaad-vivaad sammilit hai, jinamein pratham dwarpal ko santusht kar sabha main pravesh karne kii anumati praapt karne hetu, dwitiya raja janak ke gudh prashnon ke uttar ke rup main or tritiy bandi tathaa ashtavakra ke madhya shastrarth ke rup main hota he, jisamen atyant saadhaaran prathit hone vaali sankhya ek se teraa tak kii gananaayen swayan main anternihit rahasyon or gupt arthon ko jhutlaati hai
 These conversations of the epic are very similar to the Mahabharata
 mahabharat ke sanskrit kavy tathaa ashtavakra ke hindi kavy main varnit in vaartalapon kii paraspar tulana ullekhneey he
 The reader group of Madhya Pradesh Sahitya Akademi organized a conference of reviewers in Ashoknagar in September 2010 to critique the epic
 pramukh sameekshak, professor es en saxena ne kaha ki mahakavy sangharsh se utkarsh kii gaatha he or kavi ke swayan ke anubhavon se udbhoot honeke kaaran viklangon ke liye preranarot he
 Other reviewers present at the conference were writers Ramsevak Soni, Sudhir Gupta, Subhash Jain Saral and Pradeep Manoria
 samikshakon ne kaha ki mahakavy viklangon kii bhaawanaaon evam unke utthan ko prastut karata he or aadhunik vishwa main atyant praasangik he
 The Madhya Pradesh Sahitya Akademi organized another conference of reviewers in Damoh in November 2010, in which several litterateurs discussed the epic

 Puru did not try to find out what is the secret of the power of the Yavana army? The main force of the Yavana army was its fast cavalry and agile archers riding horses
 itihaaskaar maanate hai ki puru ko apni veerta or hastisena par vishwaas tha lekin usne sikandar ko jhelum nadi paar karne se nahin roka or yahi uski bhul thi
 But historians do not know that Alexander was badly trapped after this crossing of the river Jhelum, because the river was flooded after crossing the river

 raja puru jisko swayan yavani 7 foot se upar kaa bataate hai, apni shaktishaalee gajasena ke saath yavani sena par tut pade

 In this war, Alexander's army got a fierce competition on the very first day

 Despite being horrified by the Yavani chieftains, Alexander stood firm on his stubbornness and entered the battlefield between his special bodyguard and his inner defense unit
 koi bhi bhartiya senapati haathiyon par hone ke kaaran un tak koi khatra nahin ho saktaa tha, raja kii to baat bahut dur he
 King Puru's brother Amar killed Alexander's horse Bukiphilas with his spear and dropped Alexander to the ground

 Sikandar stood in front of the ground with Raja Puru sword

 Historians believe that Puru had faith in his valor and Hastisena but that did not stop Alexander from crossing the Jhelum River and that was his mistake
 lekin itihaaskaar yah nahin jaanate ki jhelum nadi ke is paar aane ke baad sikandar buree tarah funs gaya tha, kyonki nadi paar karne ke baad nadi main baadh aa gai thi
 When Alexander attacked, he was welcomed by Ambhi, the king of gandhara-taxila and Ambi secretly assisted Alexander
 aambhi raja poras ko apana dushman samajhataa tha
 Alexander sent a message to Porus, in which he wrote to Porus surrendering to Alexander, but Porus then did not accept Alexander's subjection

 Indians had the stubbornness of every citizen to kill a foreigner, powerful Gaj Sena and some unseen weapons like Satfuta spear so that a single soldier could kill many enemy soldiers and horsemen including horse

 Many valiant soldiers of Alexander's army were casualties

 There could be no threat to any Indian commander being on elephants, the king is far away

 The Greek army had never seen this happen in all its wars
 sikandar jameen pargira to saamne raja puru talwaar liye saamne khadaa tha
 Sikandar was just a moment's guest when Raja Puru shouted
 yah dar nahin tha, shaayad yah arya raja kaa kshaatr dharm tha, baharhaal tabhi sikandar ke angrakshak use teji se vahaan se bhaga le gaye
 And thus Alexander lost his only and last war

 Baleshwar Yadav was a famous folk singer of Bhojpuri
 unke gaaye birahaa bahut hi lokapriy hue
 He was born in Madhuban area of azamgarh in eastern Uttar Pradesh
 govind tritiy dhruv dharvarsh kaa putr tha
 Dhruva, after ruling successfully for 13 years, probably crowned his third and best son Govind around 793 AD during his lifetime
 uske purv govind kaa yuvarajpad par vidhiwat abhishek ho chukaa tha
 The reason for this was on one hand Dhruva's desire to make his Govind the official and on the other hand his fear that his elder boys should not start a war of succession after his death to get their rights
 saath hi dhruv ne apane anya putron ko apane samrajya ke vibhinn kshetron kaa prantiy shaasha niyukt kar diya
 But he was also not going to sit silently impressed by Govind iii's military ability and political acumen or satisfied by his father's succession to his throne
 govind tritiy ke sabase bade bhai stambh ne apane pita dhruv ke marane ke baad uttaradhikaar ke liye apni shakti aajamaane kii thaanee
 He was also fueled by some feudal kings, whose number is mentioned 12 in some Rashtrakuta records
 pehle to govind tritiy ne apane anya bhaaiyon ke tarah stambh ko bhi prasann karnaa chaha, par use koi safalataa na mili or donon main yuddh hokar hi rahaa
 Govind's younger brother Indra helped him
 yuddh main stambh kii haar hui parantu govind ne uske prati narmi kii hi niti apanaai or use apni ore se gang pradesh kaa prashaasak niyukt kar diya
 Settled on the throne, Govind paid attention to suppressing the rebellious feudals and expanding his dominion power
 gang shaasha shivabhaar rashtrakooton ke dwaara kaid kiya ja chukaa tha par kaid se mukti paakar usne swatantraaa kii pravriti dikhaai or rashtrakut adhisatta ko uthaa phenkane kii koshish kii
 Govind defeated him immediately, he was captured again and Gangwadi was merged within the Rashtrakuta Empire
 stambh pun: vahaan kaa governor niyukt kiya gaya
 Govind then defeated the ruler of Kanchi but his victory was not permanent and he had to undertake another expedition on Kanchi within a few days
 pun: usne vengi ke purvi chalukya shaasha vijayaditya par akraman kar usko apni bhrityopyukt seva ke liye vivash kiya
 After consolidating his dominion over almost all the states of the South, Govind started influencing the politics of the North
 uske pita dhruv ne gurjar pratihaar shaasha vatsaraj or palraj dharmpal donon hi ko parrast kar uttar bharat kii digvijay kii thi
 But after that there were many new scenes at the North Indian theater
 dharmpal ne chakrayudh ko apane namankit or karad ke rup main kanyakubj kii gaddi par bithaane main safalataa paa lee thi, parantu vatsaraj ke uttaradhikari nagabhatta dwitiya ne tunrat pasa palat diya or kannauj kaa swami ban gaya
 In such circumstances Govind III intervened in North Indian politics and started his victorious campaign
 kushal raajnneetijna or daksh senapati ke anuroop un abhiyaanon ke purv apane parshvon kii suraksha kaa purna prabandh kar liya tha
 In the same policy, he left Indra to prevent any accidental escalation of the Gurjara Pratiharas in Malwa and Gujarat
 After this, there was a war between Nagabhatta and Govind somewhere in Bundelkhand where the Gurjara Pratihara armies had to be defeated and Nagabhatta was sent to protect himself
 Had to take refuge in an unknown place
 tatpashchaat govind kii senaayen himalay kii ore badhin or kahin raste main dharmpal or chakrayudh ne bhi uski adheenta maan lee
 Even on his return, Govind's forces conquered south-eastern Madhya Bharat and many areas of Bengal and Orissa
 parantu govind kaa sara uttar bhartiya abhiyaan digvijay maatr tha or uskaa rashtrakooton kii sainik pratishtha kii vruddhi ke atirikt koi vishesh prabhaav na hua
 There was no increase in the north of the Rashtrakuta empire army
 iskaa mukhya karan duuri thi
 The time of his campaigns is now generally considered to be between 800-802 AD
 uttar bhartiya abhiyaanon se nivrutt hokar govind ne pun: ek baar dakshin main apni sainik shaktiyon kaa pradarshan kiya
 The reason was the rise of the spirit of independence in some of the rulers there
 parantu unhen dabaane ke purv usne pashchimi bharat main bhadauch kii ore prayaag kiya tha, jahaan shribhavan ke raja ne uskaa swaagat kiya
 From Sri Bhavan, he headed south
 gangawadi, kerala, pandya, chol or kanchi ke raajaaon na uske viruddh ek sainik sangh kii sthapana kar lee thi parantu yuddh main ve sabhi haar gaye or unke asankhya sainik khet rahe
 Govind's forces captured Kanchi and routed the Pandya and Chola regions
 govind kii sainik safalt xxrep 4 a n se sinhal kaa raja bhaybheet ho uthaa or usne bhi uski adheenta sweekaar kar lee
 It is clear that Govind became a highly qualified and successful ruler in the Third Rashtrakutas and continued to influence the South and North Indian politics of his time equally
 sainik or raajnneetik pratishtha kii drushti se use samasamyik bharat kaa sarvapramukh shaasha kaha ja saktaa he
 He grew the most of the Rashtrakuta dynasty in his time and behind his successes his personal valor, diplomacy and mobilization power was abundant
 is prakaar lagbhag 20- 21 varshon tak atyant yogyata or safaltaapurvak shashan karne ke baad 814 i

 Poetry, poetry or poetry, is the genre of literature in which a story or emotion is artistically expressed by a language
 bharat main kavita kaa itihaas or kavita kaa darshan bahut purana he
 Its beginning can be understood from Bharatmuni
 kavita kaa shabdic arth he kaavyatmak rachana yaa kavi kii kriti, jo chhandon kii shrunkhalaaon main vidhivat baandhi jaati he
 Poetry is the syntax that makes the mind complete with any juices or impulses
 arthath vahjisamen chune hue shabdon ke dwaara kalpana or manovegon kaa prabhaav daalaa jaataa he
 In Rasgangadhar the exponent of the meaning of 'delightful' is called 'poetry'
 'arth kii romaniyata' ke antargat shabd kii romaniyata bhi samajhakar log is lakshan ko sweekaar karte hai
 But 'elegance' of 'earth' can be of many types
 isse yah lakshan bahut spasht nahin he
 Literature is the most appropriate sign of the poet Vishwanath
 uske anusaar 'rasaatmak vaakya hi kavy he'
 Ras is the soul of poetry of pleasant communication of the souls
 kavyprakash main kavy teen prakaar ke kahe gaye hai, dhwani, gunibhoot vyangy or chitra
 Sound is one in which the hidden meaning is dominant, rather than the meaning derived from the words
 gunibhoot byangy vah he jisamen gaun ho
 a picture or an ornament is one in which a miracle is done without exorcism
 in teenon ko kramshah uttam, madhyam or adham bhi kehete hai
 The poetic lighter's emphasis seems to be more on the hidden sense, not on the stimulus of the juice
 kavy ke do or bhed kiye gaye hai, mahakavy or khand kavy
 The epic canto and its hero must be a deity, king, or Dhirodatta, a rich Kshatriya
 usamen shringaar, vir yaa shant rason main se koi ras pradhan hona chahie
 Periodic compassion; Humor etc
 and juices and other people's references should also come
 kam se kam aath sarg hone chahie
 In the epic, the place of Sandhya, Surya, Chandra, Ratri, Prabhat, Mrigaya, Mountains, Forest, Ritu, Sagar, Sanyog, Vipralambha, Muni, Pur, Yajna, Ranprayana, Vivah etc
 should be imminent
 kavy do prakaar kaa mana gaya he, drishy or shravy
 Visual poetry is that which is shown by acting, such as drama, skit, etc
 which is readable and listenable, it is audible
 shravy kavy do prakaar kaa hota he, gadhy or padya
 The epic and Khandakavya of the verse poetry have been called two distinctions
 gadhy kavy ke bhi do bhed kiye gaye hai- katha or aakhyayika
 Champu, Virud and Karambhaka are considered three types of poetry and poetry
 saamanyat: sanskrit ke kavy-sahitya ke do bhed kiye jate hai- drishy or shravy
 In addition to visual poetic words, the costumes, gestures, motifs, actions and performances of the characters bring excitement to the audience's heart
 drishykavy ko 'roopak' bhi kehete hai kyonki uskaa rasaswadan netron se hota he
 Audible poetry communicates juice to the heart of readers and listeners through words
 shravyakavy main padya, gadhy or champoo kaavyon kaa samavesh kiya jaataa he
 The word 'padya', which is removed from the padma in the motion, indicates the primacy of motion
 at: padyakavy main taal, lay or chand kii vyavastha hoti he
 Again there are two strains of the verse - the epic and the Khandakavya
 khandakavy ko ‘muktkavy’ bhi kehete hai
 In the Khandakavya, instead of a complete chronicle of life like the epic, one part is described
 kavitv ke saath-saath sangitatkata kii pradhanta hone se hi inako hindi main ‘geetikavy’ bhi kehete hai
 The meaning of 'geeti' is to express the emotional spirit of the heart in a phased manner
 geeti kii aatma bhavatirek he
 The poet of his emotional sensation and imagination makes the narrative emotional
 geetikavy main kavyashastreey roodhiyon or paramparaon se mukt hokar vaiyaktik anubhav ko saralata se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 By nature, the shape-type of lyrical poetry is smaller than the epic
 in sab tattvon ke sahyog se sanskrit muktakkavy ko ek utkrisht kavyarup mana jaataa he
 Muktakavya has become more popular than the epics
 sanskrit main geetikavy muktak or prabandh donon roopon main praapt hota he
 The best example of managerial lyricism is Meghdoot
 adhikansh prabandh geetikavy isi ke anukaran par likhe gayi hai
 Muktak is that in which each verse is independent in itself
 iske sundar udhaaharan amaruukshatak or bhatruharishtakatray hai
 Musical verses are characteristic of melodious verse lyrics
 shringaar, niti, vairaygy or prakruti iske pramukh pratipaadya vishay he
 a natural depiction of the beauty and nature of women is found in these poems
 upadesh, niti or lokvyavahaar ke sutara inamen bade hi romantic dhang se praapt ho jate hai
 This is the reason that the Suktikas and Subhashitas are found in abundance in Muktakayas
 muktakkavy kii parampara sfoot sandesh rachanaaon ke rup main vaidic yug se hi praapt hoti he
 In the Rigveda there is a reference to sending a dog named Sarma as messenger
 vaidic muktakkavy ke udaahranon main vasishtha or vamdev ke sookt, ullekhneey hai
 In the Ramayana, Mahabharata and their later texts, this type of sphincter is available in large quantities
 kadachit mahakavi valmiki ke shakodgaaron main yah bhaavana gopit rup main rahi he
 Hanuman, the messenger of Sri Rama sent to husband husbandman Pravasini Sita, Sri Krishna sent by Dharmaraja Yudhishthira towards Duryodhana and messenger Hans sent by King Nal near Sundari Dayamanti are the references counted under this tradition
 is sandarbh main bhagwat puraana kaa venugit vishesh rup se uddharaneey he jisaki rasvibhor karne vaali bhaavana chhavi sanskrit muktakkavyon par ankit he
 Rajasekhar has told in the episode of Kavicharya that the poet should take education of academics and sub-disciplines
 vyakaran, kosh, chand, or alankaar - ye chaar vidyaayein hai
 64 arts are subtexts
 kavitv ke 8 strot hai- swasthya, pratibha, abhyaas, bhakthi, vidwatkatha, bahushrutata, smritidrishta or raag
 Mammatt has stated six purposes of poetry - kavita yaa kavy kya he is vishay main bhartiya sahitya main aalochakon kii badi samrudh parampara he— acharya vishwanath, panditraj jagannatha, pandit ambikadutt vyas, acharya shripati, bhamah aadi sanskrit ke vidwaanon se lekar aadhunik acharya ramchandra shukla tathaa jaishankar prasad jaise prabud kaviyon or aadhunik yug kii mira mahadevi verma ne kavita kaa swaroop spasht karte hue apane apane mat vyakt kiye hai
 Scholars believe that the human heart wanders in the infinite form, trades of the eternal world, but when the human ego abandons the spirit and remains a pure feeling, then it becomes a free heart
 hriday kii is mukti kii sadhana ke liye manushya kii vaani jo shabd vidhaan karti ai he use kavita kehete hai
 Poetry elevates human beings from the narrow circle of selfish relationships and helps in making a raga connection with the rest of creation
 kavy kii anek paribhaashaayen di gai hai
 These definitions also hold true for modern Hindi poetry
 kavy siddh chitt ko alokik anandanubhuti karaata he to hriday ke taar zankrut ho uthte hai
 Poetry also contains the feeling of Satyam Shiva Sundaram
 jis kavy main yah sab kuch paaya jaataa he vah uttam kavy mana jaataa he
 There are two distinctions of poetry: swaroop ke aadhaar par kavy ke do bhed hai - shravyakavy evam drushyakavy
 The poetry which is praised by listening to others or reading by itself is called audible poetry
 jaise ramayana or mahabharat
 Audio poetry also has two distinctions - Prabandha poetry and Muktak poetry
 isamen koi pramukh katha kavy ke aadi se ant tak krambaddh rup main chalati he
 The sequence of the story breaks in the middle and secondary stories become helpful in between
 jaise ramcharita maanas
 There are two distinctions of management poetry - epic and Khandakavya
 1- mahakavy isamen kisi aitihaasik yaa puranic mahapurush kii sampurna jivan katha kaa adyopant varnan hota he
 These things must be in the epic - 2- khandakavy isamen kisi kii sampurna jeevanakatha kaa varnan na hokar keval jivan ke kisi ek hi bhaag kaa varnan hota he
 It is necessary to have these things in the section Poetry- isamen keval ek hi pad yaa chand swatantra rup se kisi bhav yaa ras athwa katha ko prakat karne main samarth hota he
 The songs, poets, doha etc
 are free
 jis kavy kii anandanubhuti abhinay ko dekhakar evam paatro se cathopakathan ko sun kar hoti he use drishy kavy kehete hai
 Like in a drama or a movie
 1- padya kavy - isamen kisi katha kaa varnan kavy main kiya jaataa he, jaise gitanjali 2- Prose Poetry - In this, a story is described in prose, such as Jaishankar's commission
 
 
 gadhy main kavy rachana karne ke liye kavi ko chand shaastra ke niyamon se svachhndatha praapt hoti he
 3- Champu Poetry - It consists of both prose and poetry
 maithilisharan gupt kii 'yashodhara' champu kavy he
 The history of modern Hindi poetry is about 800 years old and its beginning is understood from the thirteenth century
 har bhashaa kii tarah hindi kavita bhi pehle itivrittatmak thi
 That is, a story was tied with a rhythm and decorated with ornaments
 bhartiya sahitya ke sabhi pracheen granth kavita main hi likhe gaye hai
 The specific reason for this was that poetry was easy to memorize due to the rhythm and verses
 jis samay chhapekhane kaa avishkaar nahin hua tha or dastavezon kii anek pratiyaan bananaa aasaan nahin tha us samay mahatvapurn baton ko yaad rakh lene kaa yah sarvottam saadhan tha
 That is why at that time, along with literature, politics, science and Ayurveda were also written in the verse itself
 bharat kii pracheenatam kavitaayen sanskrit bhashaa main rugveda main hai jinamein prakruti kii prashasti main likhe gaye chhandon kaa sundar sankalan hai
 Many other subjects of life have also found place in these poems

 sikh dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Khalsa is a collective form of duly initiated followers of Sikhism
 khalsa panth kii sthapana guru gobind singh ji ne 1699 ko baisakhi vaale din anandpur sahib main kii
 On this day, he made five love amritpan by making Khalsa first and after that he also performed Amritpanan by the hands of those five loves
 satguru gobind singh ne khalsa mahima main khalsa ko "kaal purakh kii fuj" pad se niwaja he
 Sikhs and hair were already with the Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh fixed the "khande Bate ki Pahul" and also gave it Kacha, Kadha and comb
 isi din khalse ke naam ke peeche "singh" lag gaya
 Khalse's body began to be seen in physical appearance
 par khalse ne aatm gyaan nahin choda, us kaa prachaar chalata rahaa or aavashyaktaa padane par talwaar bhi chalati rahi
 The attacks of other religions and governmental Numindo over Sikhism had steadily increased
 sarkaar ko galat khabaren de kar islam ke kattar anuyaayiyon ne guru arjuna dev ji ko maut kii sajaa dilava di
 When Guru Arjun Dev was martyred with great grief, Guru Hargobind ji lifted the sword
 yah talwaar sirf aatm raksha or aam janata kii behatari ke liye uthaai thi
 In the life of Guru Hargobind ji, there were 4 consecutive attacks on him and there was also an attack on Satguru Hari Rai
 guru hari krishna ko bhi badshaah aurangzeb ne apana anuyaayi banane kii koshish kii
 The government killed Guru Tegh Bahadur, because he had gone to appeal to the government after seeing the sufferings of the Hindu Brahmins
 uske baad sarkari ahalakaaron ne gurmat ke badhate prachaar va anuyaayiyon kii baari sankhya ko apane dharm ke liye khatra samajhnaa shuru kar diya or wo iske viruddh ekajute ho gaye
 Meanwhile Guru Gobind Singh composed some banis which had strict comments against Islam
 uparokt paristhitayon tathaa aurangzeb or uske numaayindon ke gaiyr-muslim janata ke prati atyaachaari vyavhaar ko dekhte hue dharm kii raksha hetu jab guru gobind singh ne sashastr sangharsh kaa nirnay liya to unhone aise sikhon kii talash kii jo gurmat vichaardhaara ko aage badhaaen, dukhiyon kii madad karen or zaroorat padhne par apana balidaan dene main bhi peeche naa haten| When a religion progresses, it is very common to see that its followers are many, most of them are seen, some are in the shadows, some are due to their own self-will, the real followers are counted only as they are Huh
 is baat kaa pramaan anandpur main mila
 When Satgur Gobind Singh came out with a sword and said, "he needs a head"
 All of them were stunned
 Some slip away from the spot
 The Guru started going mad
 Some came to watch the spectacle
 Some mata ran to Gujri to see what Khumdi is cooking
 10 hazaar kii bheed main se pehla haath bhai dayaa singh ji kaa tha | gurmat vichaardhaara ke peeche voh sir katwane kii shamata rakhata tha | guru sahib usko tamboo main le gaye | vahaan ek bakre kii gardan kaati | khun tamboo se bahar nikalataa dikhaai diya | janata main dar or bad gaya | tab bhi himat dikhaa kar dharm singh, himmat singh, mohakam singh, sahib singh ne apana sis katwanaa sweekaar kiya | guru sahib bakre jhatakate rahe | The five then got out of the tent and made the pahul of khande bate
 khanda bata, jantra mantra or tantra ke smel se bana he
 It was first built by Satgur Gobind Singh
 is vidhi se hua tayar jal ko "pahul" kehete hai
 In common language, it is also called Amrit
 is ko pi kar sikh, khalsa fuj, kaa hisa ban jaataa he arthath ab usne tan man dhan sab parameshwar ko saunp diya he, ab wo sirf sach kaa prachaar karegaa or zarurat padhne par wo apana galaa kataane se peeche nahin hatega
 Will stay away from all vices
 aise sikh ko amritadhari bhi kaha jaataa he
 This Pahul was fed to all five and got them from the title of five loves
 2 kakkar to sikh dharm main pehle se hi the
 Where Sikhs understood spiritually even on all things, Satgur Gobind Singh ji separated the Khalsa in the physical look by giving them comb, kadha and kacha along with those two kakars
 aaj khande bate kii pahul paanch pyaare hi tayar karte hai
 This process has become a custom today
 aaj waisi pariksha nahin lee jaati jaisi us same lee gai thi
 This process is also called Amrit Sanchar
 itihaas is baat kaa gavaah he ki guru gobind singh ji bhi paanch pyaaron ke aadhin chalaa karte the or un ke hukum ko mana karte the
 The five loves ordered Gobind Singh to leave the fort of Chamkor and he had to obey
 paanch pyaaron ne phir gobind singh ji ko tokaa, jab gobind singh in kii parakh ke liye dadu kii kabr par namaskara kar rahe the
 Gobind Singh also sent Banda Bahadur with five loves, history mentions that when Banda Bahadur continued to violate the love, Banda Bahadur was all left in the fort
 gobind singh or khalsa fuj ne bahadur shah kii madad kii or use shaasha banane ke liye uske bhai se loha bhi liya
 It was Khalsa who discovered the bani of Guru Gobind Singh and molded it as a book

 voltmetre ek maapan yantra he jo kisi paripath ke kinhin do binduon ke bich vibhavaantar ko maapne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 In 1819 Hans Orested invented the voltmeter
 unhone chumbakeey dishasuchak kii sui ke paas rakhe taar main vidyut dhara kaa pravaah kiya to unhone dekha ki isaki disha main parivartan ho rahaa he
 On notice, it is known that the more ampere current in the wire, the faster the direction of the needle changes
 isi kaaran se unka maapan ekadam sahi nahin aa rahaa tha
 In the 19th century, Arsene de Arsonval made instruments that could measure better than those made earlier
 iske liye unhone compas kii sui ko chota kiya or use chaaron taraf se chumbak se gher diya
 It is known as the d'arsonval movement and is used in today's analog meters
 vyaavhaarik taur par voltmetre ameter kii tarah hi kaam karte hai, jo voltage ko maapne ke saath, vidyut dhara or pratirodh ko bhi maapte hai
 The voltmeter has two ends
 jin do binduon ke bich vibhavaantar maapna hota he, un par in terminlon ko jod diya diya jaataa he
 The resistance between the two ends of the voltmeter must be very high
 kisi dharamapi ko voltmetre main badalane ke liye uske shreneekram main bahut bade maan kaa pratirodh jodna padataa he

 musalmaan inke liye param aadar bhav rakhte hai
 Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abdul Muttalib ibn Hashim was, in short, Muhammad, the last prophet of Islam, and re-founder
 According to Islamic principles, he was a prophet and messenger of Allah, who was sent to present and confirm the monotheistic teachings preached by Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and other prophets
 He is seen as the last Prophet of Allah in all the main branches of Islam
 Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam united the Arab State on the basis of al-quran, Sunnah and Hadiths on political and religious lines
 The central religious book of Islam, "al-qur'an", was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad from 610 to 632, which was written for the first time after the death of Hazrat
 Muslims often refer to Muhammad as Prophet Muhammad, or just Prophet
 Rasool refers to Allah, And consider him the best of all prophets
 He is seen by Muslims as the master of all virtues
 When referring to Muhammad, sallallahu alaihi wasallam is used by Muslim people, though "peace be upon them" or "peace be upon them" is also used instead, abbreviating the Arabic phrase as s

 At the age of 40, Muhammad received the first oral revelation of the Quran in a cave called Hira
 Subsequently, he was exposed to the complete Quran in a period of 23 years
 Muslims believe that Muhammad was asked by Allah to preach monotheism and print idolatry, which was practiced in eastern Arabia, at the persecution of newly converted Muslims in Mecca and the invitation of the Medina delegation, Muhammad and His followers migrated to Madina in 622 AD, this incident is called Hijrat
 Hizrat, the turning point of the life of Hazrat Muhammad, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar of Hijri

 According to the Quran, Muhammad is the last prophet in the series of prophets sent by Allah
 The Quran refers to Muhammad as "nabi", "messenger of Allah", "prophet"
 Qur'an's 2: 101, 2: 143, 2: 151, 3:32, 3:81, 3: 144, 3: 164, 4: 79-80, 5:15, 5:41, 7: 157, 8: In verses 01, 9: 3, 33:40, 48:29, and 66:09, Muhammad is called by various names, including bearers of good news, cautioners, and "who invite people to a just God Are, included
 The Quran states that Allah had sent Muhammad as "rahmat ul lil Alameen" for truth and love for the world
 allaah kuran ke surah al-ambia 21:107 main kahata hai :to be according to kanjul iman Muhammad is mentioned in the Qur'an as "pressured", "negotiator", "god messenger", "god servant", "proclaimer", "witness", "eloquent", "warner" "reminding" " Callers are called with names like "god," "stunning", and "kanti Giver"

 The Quran also classifies some religious issues regarding Muhammad

 bhure boune gas ke bane hote hai, jisamen hydrogen or hilium pradhan hoti hai
 Brown dwarfs are smaller than stars and do not have enough gravity to begin the process of nuclear fusion by crushing atoms of hydrogen gas, but some other heavy elements begin to coalesce - such as deuterium and lithium
 Of gas daanav grahon main bilkul kisi prakaar kaa sanyalan nahin hota
 There is some dispute among scientists that on which shape Vastu gas does not remain a monster and becomes brown dwarf and on which shape it becomes a star

 viraam shabd vi + ram + ghan se bana he or iskaa mul arth he "tehraav", "aaraam" aadi ke liye
 The common signs, which divide the sentence into different parts for clarity of meaning, are called "breaks" in grammar or composition
 "viraam" kaa thik angreji samanaarthi "stop" he, kintu prayog main is arth main "panktuation" shabd miltaa he
 "punctuation" refers to the word Latin, meaning "point"
 is prakaar "panktuation" kaa yatharth arth bindu rakhana" yaa "vaakya main bindu rakhana" he
 Often people understand that the use of the word "break" in this sense is modern and it is a translation of the word "punctuation"
 kintu tatvat: aisi baat nahin he
 Long before Panini, the use of the word 'break' in the texts and teachings is found in similar meanings
 taittareey praatishakhya main chaar prakaar kaa viraam mana gaya he : That is, Rigviram, Padaviram, Vivrutiviram, Equivocalism, and the amounts of these breaks are considered to be three, two, one and half respectively
 inamen rugviram charan yaa chand ke ant ke liye arthath aaj ke purna viraam jaisaa he
 "rik" means verses, hence this break is called "rigviram"
 iske liye praaia: ek yaa do khadi pai dene kii parampara rahi he
 Sometimes they have also made small trees or flowers
 "padviram" do shabdon yaa padon ke bich main aata he
 Interrupts posts
 padon ke bich main hone ke kaaran hi iskaa naam "padviram" he
 There is virtually no punctuation between posts
 iskaa aashay maatr yah he saamaanya bhashaa main padon ke bich viraam athwa dhwani kaa abhaav hota he or use lagbhag do maatra hona chahie
 The third break also comes in between words or terms, but they are special words or terms
 kabhi kabhi sanskrit main aisa hota he ki shabd ke ant main swar aata he or uske badwaale shabd ke pranrabh main bhi swar
 In such a situation, a pact is usually done
 kintu jab inke bich sandhi nahin hoti, to in donon shabdon ke bich kaa viraam anya prakaar ke saamaanya shabdon yaa padon ke bich ke viraam se aadha arthath keval ek maatra kaa hota he
 This is the "paradox"
 "hari etu," "aho isha:" ke bich ke viraam isi varg ke hai
 "vivruti" is the technical name of the vowel vividness of the vowels: swarayorsandhi: - Taittiriya Pratishkath)
