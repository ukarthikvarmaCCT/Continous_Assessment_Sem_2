 dhyaan rahe ki urdu ke liye bhi aise badlaav kiye gaye hai, lekin urdu main alag tarah se parivertikaran hua jis se pashto or urdu lipiyon main kuch antar he
 Pashto has two main dialects: northern and southern
 uttari pashto bolne vaale apni bhashaa ko "pakhto" bolte hai or dakshini pashto bolne vaale apni bhashaa ko 'pashto' bolte hai
 Apart from its main division, words are spoken in different accents at different places
 alag-alag sthanon kii upbhaashaon main kuch chune hue shabd is prakaar hai: As can be seen, many of the Pashto words are similar to Sanskrit or Hindi
 is vajah se bahut se bhashavaigyanikon ko pehle bhram ho gaya ki shaayad pashto bhi ek hind-arya bhashaa he, lekin vyakaran jaanchne se pataa laga ki yah ek irani bhashaa he jisapar hind-arya bhashaaon kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa he

85 Aghua is a village in Phulpur, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh
 angreji main Delhua
 delhua bihar rajya main navada shahar se lagbhag 20 kilometre dur basaa hua ek sundar gaanv he
 It comes under the Sarakanda Panchayat of Govindpur Block
 yah gaanv prakruti kii god main basaa hua he
 This market is about 3 km from Govindpur
 ek taraf sakari nadi or duusari taraf pahaado kii lambii srinkhalaayen hai
 The population here is about 2000
 yahan kii adhiktar aabaadi krishi par nirbhar he
 The soil here is very fertile
 yahaan dhan or gehun ke saath - saath shabjiyon or daal kii bhi kheti hoti he
 The fields here are small, so traditional farming is done here
 yahan kaa mukhya bazaar govindpur he
 People here go to Govindpur market for shopping and selling
 jaisaa kii sabhi sthaan chaahe wo gaanv ho yaa koi shahar, in sabhi ke basane yaa basaane kaa ek itihaas hota he thik usee tarah delhua ke banane kaa bhi itihaas rahaa he
 History of Delhua by the late Chetu Ram Ji 


 baat un dinon kii he jab bharat ko aaazaad hue lagbhag 10 saal ho gaye the, aazaadee kaa jashn abhi tak logon ke dilon main chaaya hua tha
 At that time, the existence of Delhua was negligible
 jaisaa kii mana jaataa he puraane samay main koi bhi shahar ho yaa gaanv, unako nadi ke kinare basaaya jaataa tha taaki kaaphi jaruratein nadi se puri ho jaae thik usee tarah delhua gaanv bhi sakari nadi ke kinare basaa tha
 There were 7 to 8 Fush huts in the name of the village
 us samay khet hi jivan yaapan kaa jariya tha
 The Sakri river also flowed at that time like it is currently flowing
 sakari nadi ke kinare kii mitti badi upjau pehle bhi thi or aaj bhi he, isliye us samay bhi khaane yogya fasal ho jaati thi
 Life has been like this for many years
 us samay bas do vaqt kaa khaanaa mil jaae yahi jindagi hoti thi
 Far deserted and forest only visible
 dur dur tak koi gaanv nahin tha
 At that time there was only Nawada in the name of the city where it was not easy to go
 or jaae bhi kyon kyonki shaharon main jane ke liye paisa chahie or wo kisi ke paas nahin tha, parantu kabhi agar zyada hi zarurat pad jaae to yahan ke log paidal jaaya karte the
 It took up to two days to go and return from the village
 sakari nadi aaj kii tarah pehle bhi barsaati hi nadi thi
 Every year there was sure to be a flood in the rain, but the people of the village were both benefited from it
 is baadh main imarti lakadiyaan bah ke aati thi to unako ikaitha kar liya jaataa tha or puure saal tak prayog karte the
 The disadvantage was that the river also carried the fish and left poisonous snakes
 aise hi har saal hota chalaa aa rahaa tha
 It was a rainy night that year too, the Sakri river was flooded
 pani kaa str adhiktam seemaa tak aa chukaa tha or ab ise kam hona tha jaisaa kii har saal hota chalaa aa rahaa tha
 But this year, the mood of the river seemed a bit changed
 pani kaa str kam hone ke bajaae badhata chalaa ja rahaa tha
 The restlessness of all the people of the village was increasing
 par is baar yah nadi rukne vaali nahin thi, pani kaa str or adhik badhata ja rahaa tha
 Now people could not stay in this village for much longer
 kyonki pani ab gharon main bhi aa chukaa tha
 In a short period of time, there was a storm
 shor badhane laga
 Panic started
 kyonki thodaa hi samay tha gaanv ke doobane main to jo ho sakaa sabane potli main baandha or vahaan se chalane lage
 In about half an hour, all the weeping stopped in the foothills of Delhua hill and decided to spend the same night
 jo bachaa hua khaanaa laae the wo bacchon ko khilaayaa gaya
 All the people kept awake all night and kept celebrating to God that our house should be safe
 jaise hi subah hui sab kii nigahen apane gharon par thi jo kii ab dikhaai dena band ho chukaa tha
 All the runes went to the place where the village of Delhua was, everyone's eyes were moist because all the houses were washed away in that terrible flood
 vahaan bas ghar hone ke nishaniyaan thi
 And poisonous snakes made their shelter in it
 ab sab kuch khatm ho chukaa tha
 For a few days, all of them started living in the foothills of Delhua hill with the memory of their desolated village
 parantu ab is tarah se sabhi nahin rah sakate the, koi na koi faisla karnaa tha kii kya delhua gaanv phir se usee jagah basaaya jaae jahaan pehle tha yaa kahi or kisi surakshit sthaan jahaan nadi kaa pani naa pahunch paae
 sabase raay maanga gaya
 Some people were in favor that the village should be set up and some people, on the other side, after a lot of fuss, it was decided that the village would not be right to settle here, then it would be destroyed in the same way next year
 ab delhua kahaan basaaya jaae us jagah ko dhoondhna tha, to kuch logon ko nayi jagah dhundne kaa kaam diya gaya
 There was a dangerous forest at the time where the village of Delhua is now
 jisame sher se lekar har tarah ke junglee jaanavar rahete the
 By evening, all those people who had gone to find the place came back and they told that from here there is a flat area in the forest, at the distance of a treasury, as a sign there is an old karam tree which is quite big
 vahaan junglee kaanton kii jhaadiyaan hai, agar ham unhen saaf kar denge to vahaan ham apane rahane ke liye ghar bana sakate hai
 There is also a facility of water, it seems that if there is a pond in the forest, then water must be flowing from it
 vahaan junglee jaanwaron kaa khatra he parantu sakari nadi kaa pani vahaan tak nahin aayega
 The next morning everyone left for that place
 Most of the people of the village had not seen that place because at that time, due to the low population, wood was found nearby for firewood
 lagbhag 2 se 3 ghante kii masakt ke baad junglee kaanton ko hataate hue usee karam ke ped ke paas pahuche
 chaaron taraf ghanaa jangal tha
 Without delay, people started clearing the surrounding wild bushes, now that the place was clean enough that everyone could build their own huts
 jangal kii lakadiyon ko katkar, tad or kele ke paton kaa prayog karke tuta phuta sabhi logo ne apane rahane ke liye jhopadiyaan taiyaar kar lee
 It was dark
 nayi or aise khatarnaak jagah par sona sabake liye aasaan nahin tha
 Like how many people spent the night awake under the shadow of fear
 The formation of the new Delhua had started from here
 samay bitta gaya or vah jagah jo sabake liye ajanabi sa tha ab apana lagane laga tha
 Gradually the surrounding forests became more clear
 ab delhua gaanv pehle se bada or sundar dikhne laga tha
 People started bringing wood from dense forests to meet their home needs
 delhua yahan se vikaas karne laga tha
 At that time there were a lot of people in the village of Delhua, some hardworking, some intelligent, some strong, one of those people was Shri Chetu Ram Ji, who was intelligent as well as a freedom fighter
 He had a say in things
 The people of the village used to believe what they used to say
 His status was worthy of respect in the village
 When the flood of the Sakri river ended the old Delhua and the new Delhua started, the main problem faced by the people of the village at that time was food
 Everything was swept away in the flood, there was nothing but wild berry to eat
 At that time, Mr
 Chetu Ram ji went to Nawada district on foot and after a day from the order of the Collector, he took the bullock to the bullock cart
 Due to the same grain, Delhua stood again and reached here till today
 diwaali, durgapuja, holi, chhath aadi lokapriyatam parvo main se he
 Durga Puja is the best bet for the people here because Delhua is the only village in the Sarakanda Panchayat where a fair is held
 aas paas ke sabhi gaanv ke log yahaan mela dekhne aate hai or kharidari bhi karte hai
 Two roads connect this village to the city of Nawada
 ek rasta baksoti hokar or doosraa roh hokar
 pehle raste main nadi ko paidal par karnaa padataa he
 Although there are many temples here, the Shiva temple is very famous here
 yah mandir murali pahaad kii chotii par he
 Every Saturday it is worshiped with great pomp
 shivaratri ke din yahaan badi puja hoti he
 Holika Dahan is located near this temple
 yah mandir delhua gaanv kaa gaurav he
 The old belief is that
 To some extent this fact is still considered true
 aaj bhi is pahari ke pattharon ke neeche bichhuon kaa vaas he

 By heating it to a lower temperature, try to beat the pieces as much as they can, and they will never join, and by heating them to a temperature higher than the above temperature, their metal will be wasted by burning

 Apart from this, they also work to make the routes more widely accessible as the ascenders are able to stop here and rest in the journey and they are also relieved by lifting heavy equipment
 atah parvatarohan main inkaa amuly sthaan mana jaataa he
 In all the huts in Europe, employees are present during the summer season and some in the spring
 In other places, these huts are also found open in the fall
 kuch jhopadiyon main ek hissaa hameshaa khulaa rahata he
 They are unmanned and are called Winter Hut
 jab yah khuli hoti hai tab yah jhopadiyaan vetan paane vaale karmchaariyon dwaara chalaayi jaati hai, haalaanki inamen se kuch ko svaichhik karmchaaree bhi chalaate hai jo alpine klbon ke sadsy hote hai jaise ki swiss alpine club tathaa club alpine francas

 On the other hand some huts provide both types of facilities
 aagatuk vyay kam rakhane ke liye apni khaadya saamagree va pakaane ke upkarnon kaa prayog kar sakate hai athwa adhik vyay karne waalon ke liye pakaa hua bhojan bhi uplabdh rahata he
 Overnight reservation is considered mandatory, and in some popular places it is also necessary as 100 bed facilities are also filled on good weather or on weekends! The cancellation of a reservation made once is considered polite, because the employees of these huts keep a record of every ascending route and climbing plan with great diligence to ensure the security of the ascension
 All huts can be contacted by telephone and credit cards are accepted for payment in all
 parvatarohan ke sandarbh main, padaav yaa bivi ek aaraam yaa sone kii asthaayee vyavastha he, jisamen parvatarohi ko camping kii paaramparik jagah main uplabdh thaharne, khaane or upkarnon kii purna suvidhaon se kam suvidha praapt hoti he

 kai baar chote aanshik aashray kshetron jaise himandon kii daraaron, chattaanon ke kataavon or barf main bani khaaion kaa prayog hawaaon se bachaav ke liye kiya jaataa he
 These techniques were actually used in emergencies; Although when time and appropriate snow conditions are not available to build icy caves, some climbers are constantly dedicated to Alpine style as a special plan for a halt so that the weight of the tent is saved
 The main risk related to these stops is the presence of a large amount of cold
 tamboo parvaton main sarvaadhik upyog hone vaale aashray hai
 These can range from simple tarpaulin pieces to extremely heavy designs that help to avoid the harsh conditions of the mountain
 niraavaran kii sthiti main, tamboo lagane ke liye barf yaa chattan ke peeche lagane kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 One danger of tenting is that strong winds and heavy snowfall can be dangerous and due to this the tent can break and break
 iske alaava, tamboo ke kapade kii nirantar fadafadaahat se neend main baadha utpann ho sakati he tathaa aashray kii suraksha ke prati ashanka bad sakati he
 When choosing a tent, ascensors rely on special mountaineering tents that are specially built to withstand strong winds and heavy snowfall
 tamboo ke khunton ko atirikt suraksha ke liye barf main dabaaya bhi ja saktaa he
 
 jahaan paristithiyaan anukool ho to barf kii gufaaen bhi parvat par aashray kaa ek anya tarika he
 Many climbers do not use tents at very high altitudes as long as the ice conditions permit them to stay in ice caves, as ice caves are much warmer and quieter than tents
 inhen ek barf ke fawde kaa prayog karke paryaapt samay dekar apekshaakrit aasaani se banaaya ja saktaa he
 The temperature of a properly constructed ice cave will hover around zero, relative to which the outside temperature may be warmer
 inhen aisi kisi bhi jagah khoda ja saktaa he jahaan kam se kam chaar feet barf ho
 quinzi ek anya prakaar kaa aashray he, jise barf ke dher ko majboot karke banaaya jaataa he
 Igloo is used by some climbers, but it is difficult to make and requires some special icy conditions
 parvatarohan main kai baar khatre ko do shreniyon main vibhajit kiya jaataa hai: vastugat khatre jo parvatarohi ke upasthit na hone par bhi upasthit hote hai, jaise chattaanon kaa girnaa, himaskhalan or karaab mausam or vyaktiparak khatre jo parvatarohi dwaara shuru karkon se hi sambandhit hote hai
 Equipment malfunction and breakdown due to inadvertence, fatigue and inadequate technique are examples of subjective danger
 tufaanon or himaskhalan ke kaaran nirantar parivartit hone vaale raste ko vastugat khatre kaa ucch str mana jaataa he, jabaki takneekee rup se zyada kathin rasta jo in khataron se apekshaakrit surakshit hota he use vastugat rup se surakshit mana ja saktaa he
 In short, climbers should keep in mind these dangers: falling rocks, falling snow, avalanches, falling climbers, falling off icy slopes, falling icy slopes, falling into icy crevices and elevation and weather hazards
 The skill of a climber is tested in choosing and following a path using their skills and experience to reduce these hazards
 prayek chattan kataav ke kaaran dhire-dhire bikharati he, yah prakriya vishesh rup se barf-rekha ke upar tej hoti he
 The shape of the rocks changes continuously due to falling of stones, due to which deception can occur
 girti chattaane parvat par gadde bana detii hai or in gaddhon par kaaphi saavdhaanee se chadhana hota he, inke kinare praayah surakshit hote hai jabaki madhya bhaag par pathar girte rahete hai
 The rocks fall more than anything else according to the current season
 raat main bani barf chattaanon ko upar se asthaayee taur par baandh sakati he lekin din kii badhati garmi yaa barf ke pighalane par bahata pani yaa varsha in chattaanon ko hataa sakati he
 Local experiences prove valuable for detecting rocks falling on such paths
 chattan kii parat ke jhukaav kii disha se kai baar vishisht sthiti par khatre kii gambhirtha kaa pataa chal jaataa he; chattan kii prakruti par bhi vichaar zarur karnaa chahie
 jahaan pathar aksar girte hon vahaan neeche uske tukade paae jaayenge, tathaa barf par pathar girane se bade gadde ban jate hai jo dur se hi nazar aa jate he
 Climbers should pay special attention to such marks in planning to climb a new peak or an unfamiliar route
 When the falling stones meet a large number of mud ice or water, ejaculation of mud is formed
 Camping should be avoided in such potential slopes
 barf girane kii prabal sambhaavna vaale sthanon kaa sateek purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 It falls into the broken parts of the glaciers and from the hanging ridges built on the summit of the Sakari mountain range
 bade himalambon kaa nirmaan kadi chattaanon par hota he or ye thande or tufaani dinon ko jhelti hui achche mausam main zyada girti hai
 Like falling stones, it is also important to avoid them
 himand atyant dhire banate hai or asthir santulan kii sthiti par bhi dhire pahonchte hai 
 ve aam taur par din ke sabase ooshna bhaag main yaa uske turant baad girte hai
 a skilled and experienced ascension will usually consider the safest route between the most complex paths of falling snow, but still avoid such places in the afternoon of hot days
 The hanging glaciers often move away from the steep cliffs after a certain period of time
 inhen hameshaa neeche pade inke malbe se pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 It should always be avoided along the way
 ek shila parvatarohi kii dakshata uske pad va hast rakhane ke vikalp, tathaa chayan karne ke baad unako jamaaye rakhane ke kaushal se zaahir hoti he
 This depends to a large extent on the ability to estimate the capacity of the rock on which it stands

 Special attention is required when roping on some weak rocks, because they are prone to fall under the stone
 isi tarah inpar pair va haath rakhte hue bhi uchit dhyaan dena chahie
 kaaphi jatil chattaanon se pratibandhak ko paar karte samay, ek khatarnaak sthiti bad sakati he jabatak ki pratibandhak kii donon sthitiyaan atal na hon
 kathor chattaanon par aapasi sahaayta kaa bada mahatva hota he
 Two or three ascensors move with the help of each other, or by placing feet on the ice ax applied by the other to the feet
 The most important principle of mutual cooperation is that all the members of the party climb on each other's support and not as an independent entity; Each of the members moving forward should know what the front and back ascension is doing
 kharaab mausam ke baad khadi chattaanon par barf kii ek parat praayah pai jaati he, jo ise or bhi durgam bana detii he
 In such a situation, Krempon is very beneficial
 himaskhalan pahaado main sabase kam aankaa jane vaala khatra he
 People generally think that they will be able to identify and avoid these threats
 The truth is actually quite different
 har saal 120 se 150 log keval alps main hi chote himskhalanon main maare jate hai
 They mostly consist of experienced male skiers in the age group of 20 to 35, but also include ski directors and guides
 barf kii pathaar ko paar karne main hameshaa khatre kaa dabaav rahata he
 It takes a lot of time and effort to go back, excellent leadership, and most importantly an avalanche that proves that the right decision was taken
 mudane kaa nirnay lenaa tab or kathin ho jaataa he jab anya log bhi dhalaan ko paar kar rahe hon, lekin koi bhi aglaa vyakti kaaran ban saktaa he
 There are many types of avalanches, but two types are of most concern: khatarnaak phislan vaale khand sabase zyada usee jagah hote hai jis jagah ko skirs dwaara sabase zyada pasand kiya jaataa he: lambe or chaude khule hue, kuch ped yaa badi chattaane, 30 se 45 degree kaa kone, taaja barf kii bhari maatr, bade toofaan ke baad, tufaani dhalaan par
 saura vikiran se bhi skhalan kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 These will mostly be point release or wet mud type avalanches
 The weight attached in the wet slide ejaculation turns on the ejaculation
 himaskhalan kaa shikaar hue nabbe pratishat shikaar unke dwaara swayan yaa unke samooh ke anya arohiyon dwaara hi armbh kiye jate hai 
 Time parties are always advised to carry these items while traveling off-piste on Alpine routes
 arohiyon ko himaskhalan prashikshan kii salaah bhi di jaati he
 Ironically, the highest percentage of deaths in avalanches are from expert skiers who have undergone avalanche training; Probably because they prefer to ski in avalanche areas and perhaps because some people do not practice enough with their equipment to become fast and fit free
 uchit bachaav upkaran or prashikshan ke saath bhi, kisi bade himaskhalan main funsane par paanch main se ek kii marane sambhaavna hoti he or kuch minute ke liye dafan ho jane par jinda bachane kii sambhaavna aadhi hoti he
 The best solution is to learn how to avoid risky situations
 barf yaa kade himpat vaali dhalaanon par yatra karte samay, crempons parvatarohi ke upkarnon kaa ek maanak bhaag hote hai
 While step-cutting can be used many times on the snowy slopes of the medium angle, it is still a slow and tedious process, which does not provide high protection for the creampons
 haalanki, naram barf yaa powder main, crempons aasaani se funs jate hai, jis kaaran se inkaa prabhaav kam ho jaataa he
 In the other case, the ice ax not only helps, but also helps in handling themselves in the event of an ascension falling or sliding
 phir bhi ek asli barfili dhalaan par, barf kii kulhadi bahut kam hi khud ko pakadaney main prabhavi hoti he
 As an added precaution for safety to stand on the slope of the ice, the ice screws should be tied to the mountaineering rope
 europe main asli barfili dhalaan durlabh he, yadhyapi ushnkaribandheey kshetron main kaaphi saamaanya he, jahaan giri hui naveen barf sataha par jald hi pigal jaati he or niche bah jaati he, isliye agali raat kii thand main puraa drav ardg-sakht barf kii sheet main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Snow slopes are common and climbing is also common
 himpad yaa barf kii dhalaan ke neeche saamanytah ek badi him daraar hoti he, jise bergascrand kehete hai, jahaan parvat kii antim dhalaan barf-kshetra yaa himand se nikalati he
 Such berkskronds are too wide to cross and must be crossed by an ice bridge, which requires careful testing and use of an entrapped rope
 ek khasta haal khadi barf kii dhalaan khatarnaak ho sakati he kyonki isaki barf kaa puraa bhaag ek skhalan ke rup main armbh ho saktaa he
 It is much safer if it is climbed upright in place of sloping on such slopes, because it starts cutting them diagonally or horizontally and their fluid starts flowing
 jami barf par giri nayi barf vishesh rup se khatarnaak hoti he
 In case of a suspicious snow condition, progress needs to be checked
 chattaanon par himpat aksar karaab hota he jabatak ki vah sakht na ho jaae; barf par barf ek sa lagata he
 a two-day clear weather will bring snow in good condition
 Snow cannot lie in a very steep angle, although the eyes may be deceived by its slope
 barf kii dhalaan kadaachit 40 degree tak jhuki ho sakati he
 Hard frozen ice persists to greater angles
 subah barf kii dhalaane kadi or surakshit hoti hai, parantu isi prakaar se dopaher main kuch narm or khatarnaak hoti jaati hai; isliye jaldi chalane main phayda he
 Snow cracks are cracks or deep ditches that form when a glacial material passes through an uneven plane
 ye khuli yaa chhipi hui ho sakati hai
 Snow cracks open in the lower parts of the glacier
 barf rekha ke upar ye praayah sardi kii barf ke dhanushakar sanchay se chhip jate hai
 Detecting hidden cracks is a work of great care and experience
 taaja barf ke girane ke baad inhen barf kii kulhadi kii chhad kii aawaaj dwaara pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he, yaa daanye or baanye dekhakar jahaan aanshik rup se dhaki him daraar kaa konaa bilkul khulaa ho saktaa he
 The rope is the only protection against accident, and no one should ever cross a glacier covered with snow unless they have a rope, or have two companions
 daraaron ko paar karne vaale kisi bhi vyakti ko him daraar se bachaav main bhi paarangat hona chahie
 Changes in snow and rock conditions are mainly dangerous due to bad weather, these events occurring more suddenly than normal conditions are more difficult and harmful
 barf kii safed chadar main kisi raste kaa punah pataa lagaana kathin he jabaki barish sukhi sthitiyon ke sabase aasaan raste main jane se bhi rokatii he
 Climbers using the compass for direction benefit more than just experienced observers in the storm
 bilkul, bade barfile kshetron main, chattan ki tulana main galat raste par janaa aam hota he, lekin vatugat khataron se surakshit bachakar nikalne ke liye buddhi or anubhav sabase achche sahaayak hai
 Summer thunderstorms can also produce intense electricity
 agar parvatarohi shikhar par yaa uske nikat hon to maare jane kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 There are many cases in which lightning was killed while climbing the mountain
 zyaadaatar pahari kshetron main, sthaneey toofaan subah ke baad or dopaher ke pehle utpann hote hai
 Most ascensions take "alpine onset"; Which happens before dawn or first ray to protect against storm activity and lightning speed and other seasonal hazards
 Strong winds can inhibit the invasion of hypothermia, as well as destroying equipment such as tents used for shelter
 In some specific conditions, storms can also create waterfalls, causing the process of mountaineering to slow or stop
 ayijar parvat par phan hawaaen iskaa jeeta jaagta udahaaran hai
 Rapid climbing can cause 'attitude Sickness'
 iskaa sabase acha ilaaj yah he ki turant neeche utar aaye
 bahut oonchaai par arohi kaa naaraa yah hota he ki "ooncha chadho, kam so", jiskaa arth he ki sangrakshak abhyast hone ke liye oonche parvat par chadhe lekin sone ke liye neeche utar aae
 dakshin america ke andes main, atitude sickness beemaari se bachane ke liye paaramparik rup se coca kii pattiyon chabaaya jaataa rahaa he
 Common symptoms of Attitude Sickness are severe headache, sleep problems, nausea, loss of appetite, lethargy and body pain
 parvatiy kamajori badhkar hes or hep main parivartit ho saktaa he, in donon se 24 ghante ke andar maut ho sakati he
 In high mountains, the atmospheric pressure is low and for this reason there is a lack of oxygen for breath
 yah atitude sickness kaa aadharbhoot kaaran he
 Everyone needs to get used to it, even those experienced climbers who have climbed to such heights before
 saamanyatya, 7000 meter se upar kii chadhaai karte samay parvatarohi bottleband kritrim oxygen kaa prayog kar lete hai
 Some special climbers climb to the peak of 8000 meters without oxygen, for which there is always a well planned exercise
 oonchai main saura vikiran kaaphi bad jaataa he kyonki oonchaai badhane par vayumandal patala hota jaataa he jis kaaran se yah kam parabangnee vikiran ko avashoshit karata he
 The snow cover can be obstructed by reflecting radiation, which increases the risk of sun scorching and snow blindness by up to 75%

 == Mountaineering styles == There are two main styles of mountaineering: expedition climbing and Alpine system
 == Styling Shalya == Mountaineering Both main styles are: 'mohimevar Chadhai' and 'alpine System'
 Mountaineering has gained popularity as an Alpine method in Europe

 In the US, Mount Chadhane is a unique style with high snowmelt, rock climbing and alloy assortment of mixtures, mixing with the whole material all over
 The term Alpine method used in the US is used with the ascent of campaign style where ascensors use porters, cargo animals, cooks, etc
 to carry their belongings and food

 Himalayya Mohimechya Shailachi Halacha is the main theme or Bhagatil Dongrachaya Swaroopamule
 Since camping in the Himalayas can take several days or weeks to travel, and it may take several weeks or perhaps months to climb the Himalayan mountains, a considerable amount of useful goods are required

 Due to that, Mohim's style of Himalayya Mothya and the inaccessible Shikharavarch used to go to Vaparli
 The need for expedition style in Europe and North America is less because most of the mountains can be reached by air or by car, are less high and can be climbed in a day or two

 khaas baat yah he ki us vakt balika shiksha kaa jor na ke baraabar tha tabhi to sirf do hi balika adhyayan ke liye saamne ai
 Hume decided to make Etawah a big trading center, by setting up Humeganj with the nickname Hume of his own name, and opened the market which has now become a big trading center in the changing times
 hum ko us angrej afasar ke rup main mana jaataa he jisane apane samay se pehle bahut aage ke bare main na keval sochaa balki us par kaam bhi kiya

 They should get all kinds of rights like the British and there should be equality in government jobs as well

 The Government of England accepted Hume's suggestion

 The Congress began to see the government well and respected its suggestions
 hum sahab tathaa vyomeshchandra banerjee ke har suzav ko angreji sarkaar maanati thi or prayek sarkari kaary main unase salaah leti thi

 Then he stayed in Kaikubad's court too - he too was very happy with his poetry and declared him as Mulukshura
 jilaluddin khilji isi vaqt dilli par akraman kar satta par kaabiz hua
 He too gave them permanent place
 jab khilji ke bhattije or damaad allaudin ne 70 varshiya jilaluddin kaa qatl kar satta hathiyaan to bhi wo amir khusro ko darbar main rakhaa
 Even while climbing Chittor, Amir Khusro forbade Alauddin Khilji but he did not agree
 iske baad malik kaafoor ne allaudin khilji se satta hathiyaan or mubarak shah ne malik kaafoor se
