 anya: buddha dharm From 03 January 1868 to 3 May 1947, Japan was a world power, called the Japanese Empire
 japan ne 'desh ko dhanwaan banaao, sena ko shaktimaan banaao' ke naare ke tahat kaam karte hue badi teji se audyogikaran or sanyeekaran kiya jiske falswaroop vah ek vishwashakti banakar ubhara
 He later became a member of the 'axis Alliance' and became the winner of a large part of the asia-pacific region
 1942 main jab japani samrajya apane charmotkarsh par tha tab 7,400,000 varg kilometre kshetra iske adheen iske adheen tha jiske hisaab se vah itihaas main sabase bada saamudrik samrajya tha
 The Meiji Restoration was an event in Japan in the nineteenth century that restored the Emperor's rule in 1868
 is se japan ke rajnatik or saamaajik vaataavaran main bahut mahatvapurn badlaav aaye jinase japan tezi se aarthik, audyogic or sainya vikaas kii ore badhane laga
 This revolution ended the Edo era of Japan and started the Meiji period
 is punarsthaapan se pehle japan kaa samraat keval naam kaa shaasha tha or vastav main shogun kii oopaadhi vaale sainik taanashaah raaj karata tha
 The rise and Europeanization of Japan in the last phase of the nineteenth century would be considered an epoch-making event in the history of Asia and new imperialism
 meiji punahsthapana ne desh main ek nayaa jaagran paidaa kiya or japan main pashchimikaran tathaa sudhaaron kii ek lahar daud padi
 Within a few years, Japan became a state-of-the-art nation
 ab kasi bhi samunnat europea rajya se uski talanaa kii ja sakati thi
 Japan initially did its modernization for the purpose of self-defense
 yah us anubhav kaa parinaam tha ki jab tak japan swayan apane ko europea rajyon ko samakaksh nahin bana legaa, tab tak parishcham ke anya desh use chaiyn se nahin rahane denge or uski swatantraaa bhi samaapt kar denge
 However, that objective of Japan ended in the late nineteenth century
 ab japan main har kshetra main paashchaatya jagat kaa anukaran karne kii laalasaa jaagi
 This craving was not limited to change in national life, but also moved towards imperial life, due to which, like European countries and America, it too became an imperialist country
 japan ke aadhunikeekaran kaa sabase mahatvapurn pahalu uskaa apurv audyogic vikaas tha
 Large factories opened in Japan and production of goods started on a very large scale
 is tarah, japan kaa audyogikeekaran hua or vah ek udyog pradhan desh ban gaya
 Modern industrialization has been the most important driving force of imperialism
 ek audyogic desh ko kai tahar kii chizon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Raw material is first required to run an industry business
 phir, kachche maal se saamaan taiyaar kar unhen bechney ke liye bazaar kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Japan is a small country and its industrial resources are extremely limited
 apane udyog dhandhon ke liye vah swayan apane desh main praapt kachche maal se san tusht nahin ho saktaa tha; kyonki vah bahut hi aparyaapt tha
 He depended on other decades for raw materials
 yahi baat audyogic chizon ko bechney k liye bazaar ke saath bhi thi
 When production started taking place on a large scale, there was a problem of consumption of things
 in donon baton ke liye japan ko duusare deshon par nirbhar karnaa tha
 The beginning of imperial life became necessary for the achievement of raw materials and markets
 in donon chizon kii prapti bahari pichde deshon par raajnneetik prabhutaa kar hi kii ja sakati he
 No matter how backward a country may be, it will not allow its economic exploitation voluntarily
 aisi sthiti main pichde deshon ko apana bazaar banane ke liye or vahaan ke kachche maal dwaara apane vyavsaay ko badhaane ke liye un par raajnneetik prabhutv sthapit karnaa aavashyak ban gaya
 There was a way to establish political dominance - war
 atev, is paristhiti main japan ko yuddh kaa sahaara lenaa padaa or is tarah uske samrajyavaadee jivan kaa aarambh hua
 The second reason for the development of Japanese imperialism was the development of militarism there
 meiji punahsthapana ke baad japan badi teji se aadhuniktaa kii ore agrasar hua
 This modernity received special attention to the military reorganization of Japan in the wave
 iske purv japan kaa sainik sanghathan samantvaadi vyavastha par aadhaarit tha
 However, Japan's military organization underwent a complete transformation after the Meiji Restoration
 sena ke samantvaadi swaroop kaa ant kaa diya gaya
 When compulsory military service was implemented in Japan and a national army was formed
 is sena ko prashikshit karne ke liye prasha se sainik visheshgy bulaae gaye, jinhone japani jalsena or sthalsena kaa sanghathan aadhunik prasian dhang se kiya
 The army received regular salaries and the Prussian discipline was imposed on the soldiers
 shuru se hi japan ke log sainik manovriti ke the
 This trend was further encouraged in the new era
 nai sangathit sena main kuch bade hi mahatvakankshi vyakti afasaron ke pad par asin the
 Those aggressive Japan should follow the aggressive and aggressive military foreign policy
 unhen japan kii sainik shakti par atyaadhik bharosa tha or iske bal par ve japan ke rajya kaa vistaar karnaa chaahate the
 He believed that Japan's military power was invincible and could expand its kingdom on its strength
 sainik afasaron kaa yah shaktishaalee gut desh kii raajnneeti par bada prabhaav rakhata tha
 These people forced the Government of Japan to follow an aggressive offensive policy
 ise lekar nikat pados ke deshon par japan kaa akraman shuru hua
 The development of Japanese imperialism should be considered from here
 unnisvin shatabdi ke ant main europea samrajyavad kaa asia or africa main charam vikaas ho chukaa tha
 At that time both the diverse states of Europe and the United States had expanded or were busy expanding their empire into areas around Japan
 china ko luutane-khasotne kaa kaam prarambh ho gaya tha
 Therefore, for its security, it became necessary that Japan also adopt an aggressive offensive policy
 japani log apane ko shreshth prajati kaa maanate the
 He considered his country as Devaloka and his emperor as God
 unka vishwaas tha ki shesh sansar ke log junglee or asabhy he or shreshth prajati hone ke kaaran unka adhikaar he ki ve duusari jatiyon par shashan karen
 Japan was the first country in the East that could match any country in Europe
 atah apni sainyashakti ke bal par japan europea samaaj main pravisht hone kaa prayaas karne laga
 According to the Meiji Constitution, the first elections were held in Japan in July 1890 and the Parliament was organized
 lekin, jaise hi sansad kii baithak shuru hui ki sarkaar se unki nonk-jhonk shuru ho gayi sansad waalon ne samvidhan main sanshodhan kii maang kii, taaki sarkaar sansad ke prati uttaradaayi ho
 This stalemate has arisen
 pradhanmantri matasookata masyasi is prastaav kaa kattar virdohi tha
 Therefore, in 1891 AD, he dissolved the Parliament and ordered a second election
 is ashaant aantarik raajnneetik ne japani raajnneetigyon ne vichaar kiya ki yadi japan aakraamak niti kaa anusaran karne lage to sambhavatya desh kii raajnneetik main kuch sudhaar ho or logon kaa dhyaan deshiy ghatnaon se hatakar videshon main lag jaae
 Therefore, the Japanese authorities decided to follow the aggressive and aggressive policy
 japani samrajywad ke udbhav ke mul main desh kii aakraamak videsh niti bhi thi

 Homeless, without money and handicapped Ramu, while searching the streets of Mumbai, he meets a blind boy named Mohan, whose story is similar to Ramu's

 Mohan's sister Meena came from the village to become a city nurse so that Mohan's eyes could be treated
 ab mohan apni bahan ko dhundta hua shahar aayaa he
 Ramu and Mohan start singing in the streets and fill their stomachs and fall asleep on the roadside
 ek din unki mulaakaat manjula urf manju naamak ek choti ladki se hoti he jo ek amir parivaar kii hoti he or jo bahut biimaar he
 She wants to give money to Ramu and Mohan but both refuse, saying that money is not taken from the younger sister
 manju kii dekhbhaal ke liye nurse kii zarurat hoti he or doctor minaa ko uske ghar le aate hai
 Ramu wants to study further but sixty rupees is required for admission in school

 ab ve sadak ke kinare na sokar ek jhoparpatti main kholi le lete hai jahaan unki padosan mausi unhen apane bacchon jaisaa hi pyaar detii he
 When Ramu goes to the school for admission, the headmaster of the school tells him that he should have someone who can take his responsibility or else he cannot get admission according to the law of the school
 tabhi skool ke ek shikshak sharma ji aage aate hai or raamu ko apni chhatrachhaaya main le lete hai
 He tells Ramu that Ramu should leave the slum and come to his house and study
 lekin raamu apane dost mohan ko chhodane ke liye raji nahin hota he
 One day Mohan hears that someone is calling Meena and he eagerly proceeds to meet his sister, but due to her being a beggar, Meena refuses to recognize him
 baad main minaa ashok ko sab sach bataa detii he
 Meanwhile Manju also dies
 ek din gali kii ladaai main police raamu ko hiraasat main le leti he
 Sharma ji gives him his bail and says that now he will not let him stay in the slum
 raamu maan jaataa he or unke saath rahane chalaa jaataa he
 Mohan's heart breaks
 tabhi sharma ji kaa dehant ho jaataa he or raamu ke paas imtihaan kii fis bharne ke paise nahin hote hai
 When Mohan comes to know about this, even in sickness he sings and collects money and secretly deposits it in Ramu's school
 mohan itnaa biimaar pad jaataa he ki use aspataal daakhil karana padataa he jahaan minaa bina bataae uski dekhbhaal karne lagati he
 Ramu tops the exam and when he learns the truth, he goes to the hospital to meet his friend
 mohan minaa or raamu ko maaf kar detaa he or phir teenon gale milte hai

 There is a difference of opinion among scholars about the place of birth, but most scholars consider their birth in Kashi only, which also confirms this statement of Kabir himself
 kabir ke guru ke sambandh main prachlit kathan he ki kabir ko upyukt guru kii talash thi
 He wanted to make Vaishnava saint Acharya Ramanand his master but he refused to make Kabir a disciple but Kabir decided in his mind to make Swami Ramananda his master at all costs, for this, a thought in Kabir's mind He came that Swami Ramanand ji goes to bathe in the Ganges at four o'clock in the morning before he will lie down the stairs on his way and he did so
 ek din, ek pahar raat rahete hi kabir panchganga ghat kii sidhiyon par gir pade
 Ramanand ji was descending the stairs to perform Gangesan, when his foot fell on Kabir's body

 Kabir accepted the same Rama as the deeksha-mantra and accepted Ramanand ji as his guru

 Kabir's Rama is unknowable and resides in every particle of the world
 kabir ke ram islam ke akeshwarwadi, eksattavadi khuda bhi nahin hai
 In Islam, Khuda or Allah is believed to be different from entire world and creatures and supremely capable

 Rather, on the contrary, they are the prevalent Ramta Ram

 kabir ram kii kisi khaas roopakriti kii kalpana nahin karte, kyonki roopakriti kii kalpana karte hi ram kisi khaas dhaanche main bandh jate, jo kabir ko kisi bhi haalat main manjuur nahin
 Kabir wanted to give a different and broader form to the concept of Ram
 iske kuch vishesh kaaran the, jinaki charchaa ham is lekh main aage karenge
 But despite this, Kabir definitely establishes a personal family type relationship with Ram
 ram ke saath unka prem unki alokik or mahimashali satta ko ek kshan bhi bhulaae bagaiyr sahaj premparak maanviya sambandhon ke dharaatal par pratishthit he
 Kabir believes in the name, not the form
 haalaanki bhakthi-samvednaa ke siddhanton main yah baat saamaanya rup se pratishthit he ki ‘naam rup se badhkar he’, lekin kabir ne is saamaanya siddhant kaa kranthidharmee upyog kiya
 Kabir, with the name Ram, gave a sublime and comprehensive look to the centuries-old synthetic sentiments created in Lokmanya and tried to prevent him from being tied to the mythology-propounded Brahminical ideology
 kabir ke ram nirgun-sagun ke bhed se pare hai
 In fact, he used the word 'nirgun Rama' - 'nirgun Rama Japahu Re Bhai' to separate his Rama from Rastra, the patron of the scripturally-rendered Avatari, Saguna, dominant Varnashrama system
 ’ is ‘nirgun’ shabd ko lekar bhram main padane kii jarurat nahin
 Kabir means just this word that God cannot be bound within the boundaries of any name, form, quality, time etc
 jo sari simaaon se pare hai or phir bhi sarvatra hai, vahi kabir ke nirgun ram hai
 He named it 'ramta Ram'
 apane ram ko nirgun visheshan dene ke baavjood kabir unke saath maanviya prem sambandhon kii tarah ke rishte kii baat karte hai
 Sometimes he considers Rama as his lover or husband, and sometimes he is a lord in the sense of bondage
 kabhi-kabhi vah ram ko vatsalya murti ke rup main maan maan lete hai or khud ko unka putr
 This kind of succulent, spontaneous, human love is unique to Kabir's devotion even with the nirgun-formless Brahm
 yah duvidha or samasya dusron ko bhale ho sakati he ki jis ram ke saath kabir itane anany, maanviya sambandhparak prem karte hon, vah bhala nirgun kaise ho sakate hai, par khud kabir ke liye yah samasya nahin he
 He also says, "santou, tell me cheating
 gunamem nirgun, nirgunamem gun, baat chhandi kyun bahise!”nahin he
 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain, while expressing his views regarding Kabir's spiritual practice of Ram and Kabir, said: "kabir's entire life was spent in the search for truth and refutation of the truth
 kabir kii sadhana ‘‘maanane se nahin, ‘‘jaanane se armbh hoti he
 He is not a disciple of anyone, but a disciple warned by Ramanand
 unke liye ram rup nahin he, dasharathi ram nahin he, unke ram to naam sadhana ke pratik hai
 His Rama is not imprisoned within the boundaries of any sect, caste or country
 prakruti ke kan-kan main, ang-ang main raman karne par bhi jise anang sparsh nahin kar saktaa, ve alakh, avinashi, param tatv hi ram hai
 His Rama is not a discriminator between man and man
 ve to prem tatv ke pratik hai
 Rising above the sense of love or worship are: ‘prem jagaavai virah ko, virah jagaavai piu, piu jagaavai jeev ko, joi piu soi jiu' - jo piu he, vahi jeev he
 That is why his whole practice is the practice of "hans Ubaran Aaya"
 is hans kaa ubaarana pothiyon ke padhane se nahin ho saktaa, dhai aakhar prem ke aacharan se hi ho saktaa he
 Religion is not a matter of wear and tear, it is a continuous practice of conduct in life
 unki sadhana prem se armbh hoti he
 Love it so deeply that God becomes divine for you
 usko paane kii itani utkantha ho jaae ki sabase vairaygy ho jaae, virah bhav ho jaae tabhi us dhyaan samadhi main piu jaagrath ho saktaa he
 That same Pew can awaken a creature sitting in your heart
 joi piu he soi jiu he
 Then you will love the world, the world will become an object of your love for each organism
 sara ahankaar, sara dwesh dur ho jayega
 Then great spirit will arise
 isi mahabhaav se puraa sansar piu kaa ghar ho jaataa he

 Oracle corporation anterrashtriyakrut databes anuprayog kaa nirmaan karne ke liye aujaaron tathaa mekensm ke saath databes developers pradaan karata he jise aantarik rup se "bhumandalikaran" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Oracle products have historically followed their release-marking and naming conventions
 Oracle RDBMS 10g ke jari hone ke saath, Oracle corporation ne "10g" label ke prayog se apane pramukh utpaadon ke sabhi maujuuda sanskarnon kaa maanakeekaran karnaa shuru kar diya, haalanki kuch sutron ne Oracle anuproyog release 11i ko Oracle 11i ke rup main sandarbhit karnaa jari rakhaa
 pramukh databes sambandhit utpaadon or unke sanskarnon main se kuch main shaamil hai: Since version 5, Oracle's RDBMS release notation has used the following code: prayek release ke bheetar, sanskaran-ankan rachanakram is pattern kaa anusaran karata he: major
maintenance
application-server
component-specific
platform-specific
 For example, "10
2
0
1 for 64-bit Solaris" means: the tenth major version of Oracle, maintenance level 2, Oracle Application Server 0, level 1 for Solaris 64-bit
 Oracle prashaasak guide Oracle release sankhya par adhik jaankaree pradaan karata he
 Oracle Corporation provides a table showing the latest patch-set releases by major releases, operating-system and hardware-architecture
 Oracle corporation nimnlikhit uplabdh karne kaa daawa karti he: Over various versions of Oracle database management software, Oracle Corporation subdivides its products into various "versions", ostensibly for marketing and licensing reasons
 ghatate maap ke anumaanit kram main, hamen pataa chalaa: Prior to releasing Oracle9i in 2001, Oracle Corporation moved its database product to a wide variety of platforms
 haal hi main, Oracle corporation, oparating-system platformon kii ek choti shrenee par samekit hua he
 As of October 2006, Oracle Corporation supported the following operating systems and hardware platforms for Oracle Database 10g: Oracle corporation, Oracle databes kii mukhya kaaryakshmata ke liye kuch ekstansion ko "databes vikalp" ke rup main sandarbhit karata he
 As of 2008 such options include: zyaadaatar maamalon main, in vikalpon kaa upyog karne main atirikt licencing laagat lagati he
 In addition to its RDBMS, Oracle Corporation has released several related suites of tools and applications related to the implementation of Oracle Database
 udhaaharan ke liye: In addition to clearly defined database options, Oracle Database may include several semi-autonomous software subsystems, which Oracle Corporation sometimes refers to as "features", which implies a slightly different from its usual usage
 it happens
 udhaaharan ke liye, Oracle data guard aadhikarik taur par, ek "feechar" ke rup main myne rakhata he, lekin sql*plus, ke bheetar cmand-steke, haalanki ek prayojya suvidha, Oracle suchi main "feecharaz" kii suchi main prakat nahin hoti he
 Such "features" may include the following: Oracle Jdevalapara, Oracle farm, athwa Oracle prativetanon jaise aujaaron kaa prayog karte hue, prayokta java tathaa PL / SQL main anuprayogon kaa vikaas kar sakate hai
 Oracle Corporation has launched a 'wizard' -based environment-oriented drive for non-programmers to build common data-driven applications
 Oracle SQL develper, developers ko databes vikaas ke liye ek free graphical tul databes vastuon ko browj karne, SQL vivaran tathaa SQL script ran karne tathaa PL / SQL vivaranon ko edit tathaa dibag karne kii anumati detaa he
 It incorporates standard and customized reporting
 databes kshetra main anya praudyogiki hasil karke, Oracle corporation ne nimnlikhit le liya he: The difficulty of installing Oracle RDBMS on Linux systems had a reputation for being difficult among novice users
 ek databes sarwar ko instol karne main aavashyak takneekee visheshgyata ke str ke pare installation chunautiyon ko kam karne ke prayaas main Oracle corporation ke paas kuch lokapriy Linux vitaranon hetu packexrechent ke anusaar sanskaran hai

 RDA ke andar, HCVE aise host system vaataavaran muddon kaa abhipramann evam pruthakkaran kar saktaa he jo ki Oracle software ke nishpaadan par prabhaav daal sakate hai
 Oracle Corporation also supports certain practices and conventions to increase usage of its database products
 inamen shaamil hai: The Oracle Certification Program, a professional certification program, encompasses the administration of Oracle Database as one of its main authentication paths
 isamen teen str shaamil hai: Many official and unauthorized Oracle users groups are larger than Oracle database users and developers
 inamen shaamil hai: In the market for relational databases, Oracle Database competes with ibm's DB2 UDB and Microsoft SQL Server
 UNIX or Linux plateform par mid-range databes bazaar hetu Oracle evam IBM
 ke madhya tikhi takkar he jabaki microsoft windos plateform par mid-range databes bazaar main microsoft kaa varchasv he
 However, since IBM and Oracle have many customers in common, Oracle and IBM are keen to support each other's products in many middleware and application categories
 evam IBM kii hardware divijan parformens - optimiging sarwar praudyogikiyon par Oracle ke saath najdiki rup se karyrat he donon companiyon ke madhya ek rishta he jise "kupitishan" shabd dwaara sabase behatar tareeke se paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Other commercial competitors include Teradata, Software ag's ADABAS, Sybase and ibm's Informatics, etc
 uttarottar rup se badhate huye, Oracle databes utpaada opensorce relational databes system visheshkar postagri SQL, firebard, evam mikeshium ke viruddh pratispardhaa karte hai
 In 2010, Oracle acquired Innobase, the supplier of inodb codebase to mysql, and sunmicrosystems, the owner of mysql, to better compete in the opensource market
 opensorce model ke aadhaar par viksit databes utpaadon kii Oracle systams kii tulana main laagat saamanytah kam hoti he
 In 2007, Oracle Corporation filed a lawsuit in competition with SAP AG
 Oracle corporation samast Oracle utpaadon hetu samaygat licencing prakriya prastaavit karata he
 It bases the price list for a timely license at a certain percentage of the perpetual license price
 chunki Oracle chalaane vaale computaron main aath yaa usase adhik procesar hote hai atah software kii keemat saikadon se hajaaron dollar bad sakati he
 The total cost of ownership can often be higher than this because large Oracle installations typically require experienced and trained database administrators to setup well

 When you measure something, the accuracy is how close your measured value is to the real value
 For example, if you're actually six feet tall and your brother measures your height as six feet, one inch, he's pretty accurate
 However, if your cousin measures your height as twelve feet, 13 inches, he's not accurate at all
 amla This is anything that gives off H+ ions in water
 Acids have a ph less than 7 and are good at dissolving metals
 They turn litmus paper red and phenolphthalein colorless
 acid anhydride This is an oxide that forms an acid when you stick it in water
 An example is SO3 - when you add water it turns into sulfuric acid, H2SO4
 acid dissociation constant This is equal to the ratio of the concentrations of an acid's conjugate base and the acid present when a weak acid dissociates in water
 That is, if you have a solution of Acid x where the concentration of the conjugate base is 0
5 m and the concentration of the acid is 10 M, the acid dissociation constant is 0
5 / 10 = 0
05
 activated complex In a chemical reaction, the reagents have to join together into a great big blob before they can fall back apart into the products
 This great big blob is called the activated complex activation energy The minimum amount of energy needed for a chemical reaction to take place
 For some reactions this is very small 
 For others, it's very high

 They're called "amino acids" because they're both amines and acids amphiprotic When something is both an acid and a base
 Like amino acids, for example
 amphoteric when something is both an acid and a base
 Sounds familiar, huh? dhanagar The electrode where oxidation occurs
 In other words, this is where electrons are lost by a substance
 Aqueous dissolved in water parmaanu drabyaman ikai ) This is the smallest unit of mass we use in chemistry, and is equivalent to 1 / 12 the mass of carbon-12
 To all intents and purposes, protons and neutrons weigh 1 a
m
u
 Atomic radius This is one half the distance between two bonded nuclei
 Why don't we just measure the distance from the nucleus to the outside of the atom - after all, isn't that the same thing as a radius? It is, but atoms are also infinitely large, making this impossible to measure
 atomic solid a solid where there's a bunch of atoms in the lattice
 This is different from an ionic solid, where ions are the things that are sticking together
 The theory of after when you add protons to the nucleus to build up the elements, electrons are added into orbitals

 In other words, if you heat something up, it gets big
 rasinic sameekaran The recipe that describes what you need to do to make a reaction take place
 Chemical properties that can only be described by making a chemical change
 For example, color isn't a chemical property because you don't need to change something chemically to see what color it is
 Flammability, on the other hand, is a chemical property, because you can't tell if something burns unless you actually try to burn it
 chirality when a molecule has a nonsuperimposable mirror image
 To imagine this, put your hands together
 Although they are mirror images, you can't put them right on top of each other so they are interchangable
 Well, normal people can't, anyway
 chromatography This is when you use a system containing a mobile phase and a stationary phase to separate different compounds
 This is usually done by exploiting the differing polarities of solutes, though you can do it a whole slew o' ways

 degenerate Things are said to be degenerate if they have the same energy
 This term is used a whole lot in quantum mechanics
 Also when dealing with kids who steal cars
 delocalization This is when electrons can move around all over a molecule
 This happens when you have double bonds on adjacent atoms in a molecule denature When the 3-D structure of a protein breaks down due to heat, it's said to be denatured
 This means that it unravels because the intermolecular forces between atoms in the chain aren't strong enough to hold it together anymore
 Diffusion When particles move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration
 For example, if you open a bottle of ammonia on one end of the room, the concentration of ammonia molecules in the air is very high on that side of the room
 As a result, they tend to migrate across the room, which explains why you can smell it after a little while
 Be careful not to mix this up with effusion tanukaran When you add solvent to a solution to make it less concentrated
 When a molecule has some charge separation, it's said to have a dipole moment
 dwidhruv-dwidhruv bal When the positive end of a polar molecule becomes attracted to the negative end of another polar molecule

 vidyut apghaty' An ionic compound that dissolves in water to conduct electricity
 Strong electrolytes break apart completely in water weak electrolytes only fall apart a little bit
 electronegativity a measurement of how much an atom tends to steal electrons from atoms that it's bonded to
 Elements at the top right of the periodic table are very electronegative while atoms in the bottom left are not very electronegative electropositive when something is not at all electronegative
 In fact, it tends to lose electrons rather than to gain them
 Elements that are electropositive are generally to the left and bottom of the periodic table
 empirical formula a reduced molecular formula

 enthalpy a measurement of the energy content of a system
 entropy a measurement of the randomness in a system
 enzyme a biological molecule that catalyzes reactions in living creatures
 When the forward rate of a chemical reaction is the same as the reverse rate
 This only takes place in reversible reactions because these are the only type of reaction in which the forward and backward reactions can both take place
 equivalence point The point in a titration at which the solution is completely neutral
 This is different than the "endpoint"

 yah macir 31, em31 yaa enjisi 224 kehalaata he or aksar granthon main iskaa sandarbh mahaan andromeda niharika ke rup main diya jaataa he
 The Andromeda spiral star is the nearest galaxy to us, but overall it is not the closest planetarium
 ise amaavas kii raat ko dhabbe ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, ise nagn ankhon se dur tak ke pindon ko dekha ja saktaa he or doorabeen se shahari kshetron main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Its name is derived from the sky region where it appears, the Andromeda constellation and is named after the legendary princess Andromeda
 andromeda sthaneey samooh kaa sabase bada tarapunj he jisamen andromenda tarapunj, akashganga tarapunj, triyangulam tarapunj or 30 anya chote tarapunj shaamil hai
 However, the largest Andromeda is not very large, as recent discoveries have shown that there are many hidden cases in the galaxy and which may have even more giant forms
 spitger spes telescope dwaara 2006 main dekhne par yah pataa laga he ki M31 main karodon taare shaamil hanginaki sankhya hamaare tarapunj ke grahon se kai adhik he jinaki sankhya lagbhag c

 At the apparent magnitude of the Andromeda galaxy at 3
4, it is one of the brightest messier planets that can be seen easily with the naked eye, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution
 However when its image is taken by a large telescope, it is visible six times as compared to the full moon, then only its bright part can be seen with naked eyes or small telescope

 Andromeda Tarapunja The earliest recorded observations were made in 964 BCE by the Persian astronomer, Abad al-rahman al-sufi, who interpreted it as a "small cloud" in his epistemological book
 us samay ke anya tara chitron main ise little cloud ke rup main ankit kiya gaya tha
 The first description of the planet was made in 1612 by German astronomer Simone Marius, based on observations made by binoculars
 charles mesir ne ise 1764 main M31 grah ke rup main soochibaddh kiya or iskaa khojakarta ke rup main shrey galati se marius ko diya gaya, jo sufi al ke pehle kaary se anbhigya the
 In 1785, astronomer William Herschel noted the blurred red color in the core area of M31
 unka maananaa tha ki yah "mahaan nebula" main sabase nikatatam he or nebula ke rang or aakaar ke aadhaar par unhone galat anumaan lagaaya ki yah sirius kii duuri kii tulana main 2000 guna se adhik bada nahin he
 In 1864, William Huggins observed the spectrum of M31 and found it to be different from the gaseous nebula
 M31 ke spectra aavritiyon kii nirantarata ke liye pradarshit gahari avasorana rekhaon kaa nirmaan parat ke rup main karti he jo kisi padaarth ke rasinic mishran kii pahchaan karne main madad karte hai
 The Andromeda Nebula was very similar to the spectra of different stars that originated in which the M31 had a stellar nature
 1885 main, supernova ko pehali baar M31 main dekha gaya, jise is tarapunj main keval ek hi baar dekha gaya
 M31 was thought to be the closest planet at the time, so the object was close to an idea, so this fantasy could not gain much popularity, and this unrelated event was called Nova and named it "nova 1885"
 Gone
 M31 kii pehali tasviir 1857 main, isaac robert dwaara apni nijee vedhashala, sasex, england main lee gai thi
 The spiral structure of Tarapunja was first noticed after a long period of revelations
 haalanki, us samay ise hamaare tarapunj main aamtaur par nebula samajha jaataa tha or robert ne galati se sochaa ki M31 or isi tarah ke sarpilaakaar nebula vastav main saura mandal kii sanrachana kaa hi swaroop he jise satellite necent planets kii madad se liye gaye the
 The radial velocity of this planet in relation to our solar system was measured by Westo Slifer in 1912 at the Lowell Observatory, using spectroscopy
 jiske parinamswaroop us samay surya kii disha 300 kilometres per second main iskaa veg bahut adhik tej record kiya gaya
 In 1917, the American astronomer Heber Curtis saw the Nova in M31
 Searching for photo records, he discovered 11 more novels
 curtis ne dekha he ki un novon kaa ausatan aakaar tarapunj main sthit novon ke aakaar se 10 guna dhundhala tha
 As a result, he could be seen from an estimated 500,000 light years away
 isliye vah tathakthith "dweepiya brahmad" pariklpana prastaavak ban gaya, jo is sarpilaakaar nebula tha vastav main vah swatantra tarapunj tha
 In 1920, a great debate began between Harley Sharpley and Curtis concerning the galaxy, the spiral nebula, and the dimensions of the universe
 mahaan andromeda nebula bahya tarapunj tha, daawey ke samarthan main curtis ne hamaare tarapunj main dhundhale badalon se milti julati gahari rekhaon kii banaavat dekhi evam vishesh dopalar shift ko dekha gaya
 In 1922, Ernest Opik presented a very beautiful and simple astronomical method of estimating the distance of M31
 usne hamaare tarapunj ko andromeda se lagbhag 450 kepisi rakhaa, jo lagbhag 1500 keelvai he
 Edwin Hubel began this debate in 1925 when he first identified various cepheid stars beyond the Akash Ganga for an astrophysical image of M31
 inhen 2
5 meter hookar telescope kaa upyog karke liya gaya tha or unhone mahaan andromeda nebula kii duuri kaa nirdhaaran karne main sakasham banaaya
 As a result of which his measurements demonstrated that his feature was not the mass of stars and gas in our galaxy, but he was located at a completely different special distance from our galaxy
 andromeda ne mandakaniyon ke adhyayan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai, kyonki yah sabase nikatatam sarpilaakaar akashganga he 
 In 1943, Walter Bade was the first to find a solution of stars in the central region of the Andromeda galaxy
 is akashganga ke avlokanon ke aadhaar par, bare main unki tippaniyon ke aadhaar par, vah apane metalicity ke aadhaar par do taron kii pahchaan karne main sakasham rahe jinke naam he yang discs prakaar i main ucch veg vaale taare or puraanon main ubhare hue tip II laal taare
 This name was adopted from stars or some other place in the galaxy
 dow bade ne bhi is baat kii khoj kii ki mandakaniyaan do prakaar hoti hai jinka swaroop M31 evam brahmad ke anya taron kii tulana main doguna hota he
 Andromeda galaxy radio emission was detected in 1940 by radio astronomy major Grote Reber
 akashganga kaa sabase pehla radio maanchitr 1950 main johan baldwin ne cambridge radio khagol vigyaan samooh ke sahyog se banaaya tha
 The core of the Andromeda galaxy is called 2C 56 in the 2C Radio Astronomy Handbook
 2009 main, pehle grah ko andromeda akashganga main khoja ja sakaa
 The planet was detected using a technique called microlensing, which arises due to the optical reflections of giant planets
 andromeda akashganga kii maapi gai duuri 1953 main doguni thi jab ise khoja gaya ta vah mandakini kaa doosraa dhimaa prakaar he
 In the 1990s, both standard red giant and red mass stars were used to measure the distances of galaxies in the measurement of the Hipparcos satellite
 andromeda akashganga kii duuri maapne ke liye kam se kam chaar alag-alag takneekon kaa upyog kiya gaya
 In 2003, using infrared and surface brightness instability and, in 2001 and Freedman et al

 However, it is possible to compare galaxy's mass and M31 and the density of M31's spheroid is actually much higher than the higher stellar density

6×1010 l ☉ hamaari akashganga kii chamak kii tulana main 25% adhik he
 However, the rate of star formation in the galaxy is much higher than that of M31 with only one solar body generated per year as compared to 3–5 solar bodies in the Milky Way
 akashganga main supernove kii dar M31 kii lagbhag doguni he
 It is revealed that M31 may have had a great composition phase in the past but it is quieter than before but the star formation seems to be more active than it is in the galaxy
 kya yah chalata rahegaa, to akashganga kii chamak bhavishya main M31 kii tulana main adhik tej ho sakati he
 Based on its design in visible light, the Andromeda galaxy is classified as sab and the spiral galaxies system as de vécoleurs-sandéz
 However, data from Survey 2MASS showed that the structure of M31 emerged from a box
 Which means that the galaxy is actually seen to be linearly reflected almost as its vertical axis
 2005 main, khagolavidon ne kek telescope kaa upyog yah dikhaane ke liye kiya ki taron kaa timatimaana akashganga ke baahar kii ore badhata jaataa he jo vastav main mukhya discs kaa hi ek hissaa he
 This means that the spiral disk of stars in Andromeda is three times larger than the previous estimate
 nirantar saakshyon se pataa chalata he usamen ek vishaal taarakeey discs he jo akashganga ke vyas ko 220,000 prakaash varsh se adhik badhaati he
 Previously, the size of Andromeda was estimated to be around 70,000 to 120,000 light years
 akashganga prithvi kii tulana main ek taraf lagbhag 77 ° jhuki hui he 
 akashganga kii tiryak kaat ke aakaar kaa vishleshan use samtal discs kii tulana main ek ati spasht, S-aakaar jhukaav ko darshata he
 Possible reasons for such an inclination may be satellite galaxy gravity near M31
 akashganga M33 main M31 ke kaaran kuch jhukaav sambhav he, haalanki yah uski yathavat duuri or trigyakaar vegon par nirbhar karata he
 In the section of the spectroscopy study, different rotational velocity measurements of M31 are explained
 uske antarvaaag ke nazadik, vibhinn 1,300 prakaash varsh prakaash varsh kii trigya par 225 kilometres per second kii ucchata vaale ghurnankaree veg main dekhe gaye hai or tab usamen 7,000 prakaash varsh kii nunatam giravat dekhi gai he jiskaa ghurnankaree veg 50 kilometres per second tak ho saktaa he
 Thereafter, its velocity steadily increases to a radius of 33,000 light years, reaching a peak of 250 kilometres per second
 duuri badhane ke saath-saath iske veg main giravat aati chali jaati he, jisamen 200 kilometres per second se 80,000 prakaash varsh kii giravat sambhav he
 These velocities measure the concentric mass in the navel to be approximately 6 × 109 M☉
 akashganga ke kul dravyaman main rekhiy rup main 45,000 prakaash varsh vruddhi hoti he or uske baad isaki trigya main kami hoti jaati he
 Andromeda's spiral arm extends to the h II region, which Bade has interpreted as "scattered beads of beads"
 ve aapas main bahut adhik sate hue dikhaai padate hai, haalanki ve hamaari akashganga main dur-duure tak faile hue hai
 Refined images of the Milky Way clearly depict a two-arm galaxy rotating clockwise
 isaki do anugami poonch ke samaan bhujaaen ek duusare se kam se kam duuri 13,000 prakaash varsh par ek duusare ko alag karti hai
 They appear to be spread over a distance of about 1,600 light-years from the core
 iske sarpilaakaar ko mukhya rup se M32 ke sampark main aane ko mana jaataa he
 It can be seen migrating from the neutral hydrogen clouds of stars
 1998 main, european antariksh vedhashala chhaviyon europea antariksh agency infrared spes oborbetary chhaviyon kaa pradarshan valyakaar akashganga main pargaman kar sakati he
 In Andromeda, gas and dust form many annular forms, which form a ring especially with a radius 32,000 light years from its core
 yah valay akashganga ke drishyman prakaash chhaviyon se chipa hua he kyonki yah mukhya rup se thandi dhul se bana dhul se bana he
 On examining the inner region of Andromeda, small particles have been detected in its ring and it is thought that this may have occurred as a result of exposure to M32 200 million years ago
 iskaa anukaran karne par pataa lagata he ki choti akashganga uttararddh ke dhruviya dhuree ke saath andromeda kii discs guzari
 isaki takkar ke kaaran chote M32 ke aadhe se adhik pindon ko alag kar diya or andromeda main valyakaar sancharana kii rachana hui
 Studies of the enhanced halo of M31 showed that it is not possible to compare it to the Milky Way because the aura of stars usually contains "insufficient metals" that increase as the distance increases
 in saakshyon se pataa chalata he ki donon akashganga samaan vikasvaadi path kaa anusaran karti hai
 They have assimilated or incorporated 1-200 low-mass galaxies during the last 12 billion years
 M31 ke vistaarit prabhamandal main taron or akashganga main do akashgangaon ko alag karne vaali lagbhag ek tihaai duuri main vruddhi sambhav he
 M31 is known as a dense and small star cluster at its center
 ek badi doorabeen main adhik vistaarit vruddhi main sannhit taare ke drishyman prabhaav ko banaata he
 The brightness of the nucleus is more of a brightly spherical swarm
 1991 main, tod aar lair ne WFPC kaa upyog kiya he or use baad main hoobal antariksh telescope ko andromenda ke bhitari cendrak kii chhaviyaan lene ke liye sthapit kiya gaya
 The nucleus has two valencies separated by 1
5 parsecs
 chamakili sanyojaktaa ko P1 main dizine kiya gaya he, vah akashganga centre ke samakaksh he
 The misty valency of P2 is located in the center of the galaxy and a 3–5x107m☉ black hole
 scot tramene ne suzav diya ki dekhe gaye dabl cendrak kii vyakhya sambhav he ki yadi P1 kendriya blike hole main taron ke aas-paas utkendrak kaksh main taron ke bimb kaa prakshepan hota he
 Its eccentricity is such that the stars are attached to the orbital aposcenter, which increases the orientation of the stars
 P2 main garm varnakrameey varg a taron kii saghan chakrika he
 a star redness filter is unclear but in blue and ultraviolet light they affect the nucleus due to which P2 appears to be more effective than P1
 jabaki, isaki aarambhik khoj ke samay, yah pariklpana kii gai thi ki dabl cendrak kaa chamkila bhaag andromenda ke paas choti akashganga "kenibeliced" kaa shesh bhaag tha, jiske baad uski koi spasht vyakhya nahin kii gai
 The basic reason for this is that this type of nucleus has a very short lifetime due to the fluctuating disruption of the central black hole
 jabaki iskaa aanshik rup se samdhaan sambhav he yadi P1 ke paas uskaa apana sthir karne vaala blike hole ho P1 main uthal-puthal kaa matlab yah nahin he ki uske centre main blike hole he
 In particular, no X-rays of the galaxy were taken until the end of 1968

 The reflection of neutron stars is similar to that of a hypothetical black hole but can be distinguished by their bodies
 andromeda akashganga se lagbhag 460 golakaar punj sambandhit he
 Among these masses, Mayol II was identified as the largest giant, nicknamed the globular one, with a more massive cluster than any other common cluster of galaxies
 isamen kai million taare hai or isaki chamak omega senturi ke tulana main doguni he jo akashganga main sabase chamkile golakaar punj ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Globular 1 has many stellar numbers and is too dense for the normal spheroid
 jiske parinamswaroop, kuch log G1 ko choti akashganga kaa chota bhaag maanate hai jise kuch samay pehle M31 mana gaya tha
 The most pronounced glare of the globular is similar to that of the G76, which is located in the southeastern part of its eastern part
 2005 main, khagolavidon ne M31 main tara punj ke ek puri tarah se bhinn prakaar kii khoj kii
 The discovered New Star Punja consisted of millions of stars and in these same circular stars a similar number of other stars can be discovered
 unhen vartulakaar samoohon se bhinn kya karata he jisase ki ve adhik - kai sau prakaash varsh bade hai - or unase kai guna kam ghaney hai
 Therefore, the distance between the wires is much higher in the recently discovered extended masses
 akashganga ke samaan, andromeda akashganga main upgrah akashganga hai jinaki sankhya 14 choti akashganga he
 The best known and most visited satellite galaxies are M32 and M110
 vartmaan sakshya ke aadhaar par, aisa lagata he ki M32 kaa M31 ke saath bada hi nazadiiki saamana hua
 The M32 must have been a very large galaxy after which M31 removed its stellar image and the star formation in its core grew exponentially, ending after that
 M110 bhi M31 ke sampark main aayaa hoga or khagolavidon ne M31 ke prabhamandal main dhaatu se bharpoor taron ke kii khoj kii jo in upgrah akashgangaon se rekha ke rup main dikhain detii hai
 There is no dust of the M110 which points towards recent and current star design

 As a result of this collision, these galaxies will transform into a giant elliptical galaxy
 Such phenomena are common among galaxies in a galaxy cluster

 The numeral system represented by Roman numeration originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual method of writing numbers throughout Europe throughout the North Middle Ages
 roman ank pracheen rome kii sankhya pranali he, jisamen latini bhashaa ke aksharon ko jodakar sankhyaayein likhi jaati thim
 The first ten Roman numerals are as follows - roman anko main shunya nahin hota
 It becomes very difficult to write big numbers in them - one, they contain many letters and it takes time to understand them
 kyonki bhartiya pranali kii sthaneey maan kii avadharana inamen nahin he, isliye roman ankon main ganit karnaa bahut hi mushkil he
 As Indian numerals first spread to the Middle East and then Europe, Roman numerals began to be used only for class-chapter names, and their role in mathematics ended

 Their concern was that some governments in Europe used foreign laborers to break labor strikes
 yahan unhone faisla kiya ki is sthiti kaa muqabla karne ke liye ek antarrashtriya sanghathan banaaya jaae
 As a result, in 1864, in a conference of labor leaders and socialist thinkers of European countries gathered in London, the Workers International Union was commonly known as 'first International'
