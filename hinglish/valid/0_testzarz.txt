 "kurd" kaa matlab "chota" hota he or "kalaan" kaa matlab bada hota he
 These names have been used since Mughal times
 choti aabaadi vaale gaanvon-kasbon ke peeche khurd shabd lagaaya gaya
 This Persian word means small
 yah khurd sanskrit ke kshudra se hi bana he jisamen laghu, chota yaa sookshmata kaa bhav he
 There are thousands of Khurd dhari villages across the country
 isi tarah kai gaanvon ke saath kalam shabd judaa miltaa he jaise kosi kalam, baamaniyaan kalam 
 Just as the word khurd became synonymous with small or small, similarly the word kalan became synonymous with big or huge
 kalam kaa prayog lagbhag usee arth main hota tha jaise bharat ke liye prachinkaal main brihattar bharat shabd kaa prayog hota tha jisamen burma se lekar iran tak kaa samoochaa bhushetra aata tha
 However, a word like Hindustan Kalan is not found in any travelogue

 However, its etymology is unknown
 kuch sandarbhon main ise semetic bhashaa parivaar kaa bataaya jaataa he or ise ishwar kii mahanata se joda jaataa he
 This is fine on the basis of Kalan's economy, but it is not confirmed by any Semitic metal
 kalam shabd kaa prayog sirf sthanon kaa rutaba bataane ke liye hi nahin hota tha balki vyaktiyon ke naam bhi hote the jaise mirza kalam yaa amir kalam al bukhari jiskaa matlab bukhaara kaa mahaan amir hota he
 Obviously, the word Kalan means great here

 The names of many villages are associated with the word elders such as Sonpipri elders
 jaahir he hamanaam gaanv se fark karne ke liye ek basaahat ko varisht maanate hue uske aage bujurg laga diya gaya or doosraa hua sonpipari khurd 
 Many such rural settlements number in the thousands
 isi tarah kisi gaanv ke vishisht darje ko dekhte hue uske saath jaagir shabd laga diya jaataa tha
 This means that from the annual revenue collection, the part of that village will not go into the government treasury or it will get partial exemption
 mughalon ke daur main prabhavi vyaktiyon ko athwa puraskaar swaroop saamaanya varg ke logo ko bhi gaanv jaagir main diye jate the
 But to distinguish it from other villages of the same name, the newly created vassals used to add jagirs to them like Hinautia and Hinautia Jagir
 uttar bharat, pakistan or afghanistan main kai aise gaanv, shahar or mohalle hai jo ek jagah shuru hue or phir falkar unke do hisse ho gaye - ek mukhya yaa bada hissaa or ek chota hissaa
 In this case, "kalan" came to be called behind the name of the big part and "khurd" behind the small part

 Luthor takes Superman, whom her mother believes in, to her grip
 jab bitman or superman ek saath ek duusare ke saamne aa jate hai to donon main ladaai shuru ho jaati he
 Batman tries to kill her with Kryptonite and then Superman tells him that he has to save Martha

 With Luis's help, he realizes that Superman is not the cause of all this and when he discovers Luthor's plan, Batman also goes to save Martha

 The film's name was officially revealed in May 2014
 snider ke anusaar iske naam main "va" kaa upyog isliye kiya gaya he, ki isse varses shabd ko or bhi chota karke or bhi acha naam diya ja sake
 Henry said that it could not be called the next part of Superman because it is a different story for both Batman and Superman

 In this sense, it is the fourteenth largest city in the United States by area
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles 
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960
 The city is located in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 ° C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 ° f warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 °F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 °F, with overnight lows of 63 °F 
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 °F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 °F and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 ° f and 73 ° f in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 ° f in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 ° f in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 ° f on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 ° f on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical coral tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the bird of paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 Many people in the crowd came to support the protest, but evidence has also been found that the PAC had also intimidated people to mobilize for the protest, including cutting telephone lines in Sharpeville, telling people not to go to work Of distributing pamphlets and pressurizing bus drivers and passengers

 It has seen three great narratives and some of the most heroic works of valor still sung by local singers
 chittod ke durg ko 2013 main unesco vishwa viraasat sthal ghoshit kiya gaya
 According to historians, this fort was built by the Mauryan dynasty king Chitrangad Maurya in the seventh century and built it in the name of Chitrakuta
 mewar ke pracheen sikkon par ek taraf chitrakoot naam ankit miltaa he
 Later it came to be called Chittor
 san 738 raja bappa rawal ne raajaputaane par rajya karne vaale mauryvansh ke antim shaasha manmori ko haraakar yah kila apane adhikaar main kar liya
 Then the Paramara king Munj of Malwa snatched it from the Guhilvans and merged it with his kingdom

 In 1133, Solanki king Jai Singh of Gujarat defeated Yashovarman and took away Malwa from the Paramaras, due to which the fort of Chittorgarh also came under the authority of the Solankis

 It is a little difficult to say for sure about time
 ek kinvadanmat ke anusaar pandavon ke duusare bhai bhim ne ise kareeb 5000 varsh purv banwaaya tha
 The prevailing story in this regard is that once Bhima goes out in search of property, he meets a yogi Nirbhayanath and a Yeti Kukadeswar on the way
 bhim ne yogi se paras pathar maanga, jise yogi is shart par dene ko raji hua ki vah is pahari sthaan par raaton-raat ek durg kaa nirmaan karvaa de
 Bhima had almost finished this task with the help of his Shaurya and Devarup brothers, with only a little work remaining in the southern part
 yogi ke ruday main kapat ne sthaan le liya or usne yeti se murge kii aawaaj main bang dene ko kaha, jisase bhim savera samajhakar nirmaan kaary band kar de or use paras pathar nahin dena pade
 Bhima got angry on hearing the hen's bang and he gave a kick to the ground with anger, which made a big pit there, which people also know as the addiction pool
 vah sthaan jahaan bhim ke ghutane ne vishram kiya, bhim-ghodi kehalaata he
 The pond on which Yeti tied the rooster is called Kukdeshwar

 With his efforts, the glory of Chittor was restored
 or road rajya dwaara stapit kiya san 1538 main chittod par gujarat ke bahadurshah ne akraman kar diya
 This war is known as the Second Shaka of Mewar
 san 1567 main mewar kaa teesraa shaakaa hua, jisamen akbar ne chittod par chadhaai kar di thi
 All this Muslim invasion is one of the main reasons for the cultural destruction of Chittorgarh
 tisare shaake ke baad hi san 1559 main maharana udaisingh ne mewar kii rajdhani chittod se hataakar aravali ke madhya pichhola jhil ke paas sthapit kar di, jo aaj udaipur ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The fort of Chittorgarh always has a special significance in Rajputana
 ise mewar ke guhilavanshiyon kii pehali rajdhani ke rup main sammaan praapt he, jise unhone mauryvansh ke antim shaasha manmoni ko haraakar apane adhikaar main kar liya tha
 This fort is built in length from north to south on the hill of Aravali, in which a tank, pond, temple, palace etc
 have all been built from time to time under a definite construction plan due to the level land in the middle
 kuch jalashay to aise hai jo nirantar jalaapurti ke saadhan ke rup main kaam aate rahe hai
 There is a saying prevalent in relation to this fort, which explains the importance of this fort
 vastav main is durg kaa nirmaan abhi bhi hamen vismay va romaanch se bhar detaa he
 But from a strategic point of view it shows that due to its geographical reasons it was not suitable for fortification like fortifications like Ranthambore and Kubhalgarh
 ni:andeh kila sudrudh tha
 On the edge of the hill was a row of rocks standing on top of which a high and strong type was built
 saath hi saath durg main pravesh karne ke liye lagaataar saat daravaaje kuch interval par banaae gayi the
 For all these reasons, it was very difficult for the enemies to enter the fort
 parantu yah vistrut maidan ke bich ek lambi pahari par bana he jo anya parvat shreniyon se pruthak ho gaya he
 Therefore, it was easily prevented by the enemies by encircling it and transporting the logistics used in the fort
 is durg kaa jab-jab gheraa daalaa gaya tab-tab garh main bhojan-saamagree vidyaman rahane tak hi garh surakshit rahaa
 The Rajputs were forced to open the fort's gate for war as soon as the food items were exhausted
 lekin praayah shatruon kii badi sena hone kii sthiti main unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 Thus we see that the selection of Chittorgarh as the capital was not justified from the point of view of strategy and it was for this reason that Maharana Udai Singh made Udaipur his capital, which was much safer due to being surrounded by mountains all around

 apkendritra, yaa mathitra, saamanyat: aise upkaran yaa mashin ko kehete hai, jisamen apkendri bal ke upyog se vibhinn ghanatv ke padaarthon kaa pruthakkaran kiya jaataa he
 Nowadays the above definition of centrifuge has become more elaborate, according to which any such machine, which is designed for this particular purpose, that the substances in it can be placed under a central, continuous effect of centrifugal force, is called centrifuge
 apkendritra main padaarthon kaa pruthakkaran vibhinn ghanatv ke kaaran hota he
 Centrifuge produces centrifugal force, which is similar to the force of gravity
 kendrabhimukh bal kaa upyog aise anek prakramon ko twarit karne main prayukt kiya ja saktaa he, jo saamanyat: gurutvkarshan ke apekshaakrit alp bal par nirbhar karte hai
 Centrifuge has been used in India and other countries for a long time
 dahi tathaa doodh ko mathkar makkhan nikaalane kii kriya kendrabhimukh bal par nirbhar karti he
 The scientific definition of centripetal force is based on Newton's famous law of force and speed
 newton ke is niyam ke anusaar mukt avasthaa main, gatisheel padaarthon main, saral rekha main chalane kii pravriti hoti he
 Therefore, if such a moving substance is operated to move on a curved path, then that substance exerts force against that conducting, or controlling substance, or object
 iske falswaroop gatisheel padaarth main us vakrapath kii sparsh rekha kii disha kii ore chal padane kii nirantar pravriti hoti he
 For example, it is seen in common experience that an object traveling in a circle travels forcefully away from the cruising center
 balpreyas kii yah disha paribhraman vrutt ke sparshajya path kii ore hoti he
 Therefore, an increase in the angular velocity of the revolutions, the weight of the object or object, or the radius of the revolutions of the object increases the centrifugal force
 apkendri bal kaa ghurnan vrutt ke ardhavyas tathaa vastu ke bhaar se krmanupaat hota he, jabaki iskaa koniya veg ke varg se anupaat hota he
 The doubling of the number of rotations per minute of the centrifuge leads to a quadruple increase in the centrifugal force
 isi prakaar apkendritra kii gati main das guni vruddhi se apkendri bal main sau guni vruddhi ho jaati he
 In the act of centrifugation, the centrifugal force acting on an object, or producing an effect, is often directly compared to the weight of the object
 is aadhaar par apkendri bal ko gurutv ke gunaj rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 For gravity, the letter g is considered a symbol, so the centrifugal force is written in multiples of g for short
 yadi apkendritra main koi vastu 600 ghurnan prati minute kii gati se ghurnan kar rahi ho tathaa ghurnanvrutt kaa ardhavyas 3
84 inch athwa 10 centimetre ho, to is paristhiti main janit honevaala apkendri bal gurutv kaa 41 guna hota he
 In modern and special types of centrifuge, centrifugal force of gravity can be generated a million times
 aadhunik apkendrit dhaatunirmit ek aisa paatr hota he jisamen ghurnan karanevaala bhaag vidyunmotor kii sthir dhuree se judaa hua hota he
 Thus, the rotating portion of the centrifuge starts to rotate at the speed of the vibrometer as the Vidyumotor moves
 ghurnan kii gati vighut kii dhuree ke ghurnan ke samaan hoti he
 In the past, rotating in centrifuge was done by hand
 aajkal bhi gharelu upyog main apkendritra ke ghurnan ke liye shaareerik shram kaa upyog hota he
 In the modern ultra-fast rotating subcenter, the wind turbine is being replaced in place of the vibrator
 apkendritra ke ghurnan karanevaale bhaag ko roter kaha jaataa he
 Its shape is like a bowl, or inverted bowl
 isamen drav athwa anya vastu ko apkendritra nalee main, athwa sidhe katori main, apkendran ke liye rakhaa jaataa he
 In centrifuge work, unnecessary and noxious vibrations do not occur in the centrifuge, it is necessary that the rotor supplied by the object is fully balanced
 iske liye vastu ke sampurna bhaar ko ghurnan dhuri ke chaaron ore samaan rup se vitarit rakhana padataa he
 Under ideal conditions, the resultant of the original forces from this arrangement is equal to zero
 apkendran main dravon kii, visheshkar aise dravon kii jinamein thos padaarth ke sookshm kan nilambit hon athwa jinamein amishraneey drav kii golikaay athwa donon hi vidyaman hon, apkendran pravriti vishesh mahatv kii hoti he
 Separation of the three items from the emulsion made of solid particles, water and oil can be done easily
 apkendran main utpann honevaale apkendri bal kii tulana main gurutv bal atyant alp hota he
 In the field of centrifugal force, the fluid material tries to reverse at a greater distance from the rotation axis, causing the fluid to lie in the same thickness near the outer edge of the rotating vessel of the centrifuge
 is prakaar paatr main aksh se lekar drav tak samaan rup main failaa hua mukt sthaan utpann ho jaataa he, jo ki rambhaakar hota he
 Thus, by the action of centrifugation, the suspended micelles with a higher density than the suspending fluid are collected in the periphery of the vessel and the suspended micelles of lower density than the suspending fluid are collected at the site of the vessel
 uparyukt pruthakkaran kitna shidhra hoga, yah kendrabhimukh bal kii tivrata, nilambit karanevaale drav tathaa nilambit sookshm kanon ke ghanatv ke antar, drav kii shyanta, nilambit sookshm kanon ke aakaar tathaa pariman or kanon kii sandratha tathaa anek vaidyut prabhaar ke str par nirbhar karata he
 Centrifuge has many industrial uses
 isse vibhinn vastuon kaa pruthakkaran hi nahin varan kapadon ko sukhaane jaise kaary bhi kiye jate hai
 Pipes and tubes of different thicknesses are formed from molten metals using centrifuge force
 apkendritra upyog chini ke kaarkaanon main chini ke crystalon se jal ko dur karne main kiya jaataa he
 Unwanted amount of water is extracted from it in the manufacture of ammonium sulfate-like fertilizer
 doodh se makkhan apkendritra se pruthak kiya jaataa he
 Nowadays industrial factories use continuous flow centrifuge in which separation is going on continuously
 jaev vigyaan evam rasayan kii prayogshaalaon main apkendritra ek anivaary upkaran ban gaya he
 In the medical field, it has become possible to isolate extremely microscopic viruses and other bacteria using centrifuge
 rasinic vishleshan main ati teevr ghurnanvaale apkendritra ke upyog se ati sookshm kanon ke avsaadan kii gati tathaa avsaadan samyavastha kaa anumaapan sambhav ho sakaa he
 Centrifuge rotating in excess of 20,000 rotations per minute is commonly called ultrasentrifuge, or rapid centrifuge
 aise apkendritra jaev vigyaan, chikitsa tathaa rasayan se sambandhit anveshan kaaryon main vishesh mahatv ke hai

 sainik kii jatigat vibhaavna Soldier - The word is one but it has two castes
 Yes, two species
 One is called an officer and the other is called a rank
 As soon as you hear the words of soldiers, you would think that these people wake up in the night and guard the borders, take the enemy's bullets on the cine, protect the motherland in every situation
 It is exactly the same
 But do you know that when it is talked about their rights, then only one caste gets the loot
 And these are the castes who sit and fight in air condition, they consider the jawans as slaves, they have got their own Sandas "officer Sandas" and separate kitchen "officer Mess" made, their children slapped if they speak one word in Hindi
 They kill, no matter how ineffective their children are, they are decided to be their officers, no matter how fast a farmer's boy is, if the British are weak then they say that there is no OLQ, after retirement, after the election Golf do enjoy it, Soldiers are often the voice of television, but they always work for the benefit of their caste, and these people are called officers
 And it is these people who have drafted the OROP or the Financial Commission
 Do you still think that these castes will do justice to the other hapless caste "adhar Rank"? Don't you think that another caste should also have adequate representation in every forum? bharat rakshak brijesh kumaar
