 jinhone gurutvkarshan kaa niyam or gati ke siddhant kii khoj kii
 He was a great mathematician, physicist, astrologer and philosopher
 inkaa shodh prapatr "prakritik darshan ke ganitiya siddhanton "" san 1687 main prakashit hua, jisamen saarvatrik gurtvakarshan evam gati ke niyamon kii vyakhya kii gai thi or is prakaar chirsmmat bhautikee kii neenv rakhi
 His Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is itself the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most literary mechanics
 is kaary main, newton ne saarvatrik gurutv or gati ke teen niyamon kaa varnan kiya jisane agali teen shatabdiyon ke liye bhautik brahmad ke vaigyanik drushtikon par apana varchasv sthapit kar liya
 Newton demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are controlled by a set of natural laws, to show that he established a continuum between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, thus Overcome past doubts about sun centrality and the modernization of the scientific revolution
 yantriki main, newton ne samveg tathaa koniya samveg donon ke sangrakshan ke siddhanton ko sthapit kiya
 In optics, he created the first practical reflective telescope and developed the theory of color on the basis that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that make up the visible spectrum
 unhone shitalan kaa niyam diya or dhwani kii gati kaa adhyayan kiya
 In mathematics, Newton credits Gottfried Leibniz with the development of the differential and integral calculus
 unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa bhi pradarshan kiya or ek falan ke shunyon ke sanniktan ke liye tathakthith "newton kii vidhi" kaa vikaas kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa ke adhyayan main yogadan diya
 Newton's position among scientists is at the very top, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists at the Royal Society of Britain, which asked whether the impact on the history of science is more profound, Newton's or Albert Einstein's Of is surveykshan main newton ko adhik prabhavi paaya gaya
 
 Newton was also highly religious, although he was an unorthodox Christian, writing more on biblical hermeneutics than the natural sciences for which he is remembered today
 ijac newton kaa janm 4 janvari 1643 ko puraani style or nai style kii tithiyaan |OS]]: 25 disambar 1642]linkolanshir ke county main ek hemelet, woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth main woolsthrope menor main hua
 At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted Grigorian calendars and hence the date of his birth was recorded as Christmas Day 25 December 1642
 newton kaa janm unke pita kii mrityu ke teen maah baad hua, ve ek samrudh kisaan the unka naam bhi ijac newton tha
 He was a small child born in a pre-mature state; His mother Hannah Ayscuff said that he could fit a small mug like a quart
 jab newton teen varsh ke the, unki maa ne dubaara shaadi kar lee or apane nae pati reverand barnabus smith ke saath rahane chali gai or apane putr ko uski nani margeri askf kii dekhbhaal main chod diya
chota ijac apane sautele pita ko pasand nahin karata tha or uske saath shaadi karne ke kaaran apni maa ke saath dushmani kaa bhav rakhata tha
 As reflected in the list of crimes committed by him until he was 19 years old: "I threatened to burn the house of mother and father Smith
" baarah varsh se satraa varsh kii aayu tak unhone di kings skool, grantham main shiksha praapt kii unhen skool se nikaal diya gaya or oktober 1659 ve woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth aa gaye, jahaan unki maan, jo duusari baar vidhwaa ho chuki thi, ne unhen kisaan banane par jor diya
 He hated farming
 kings skool ke master henry stokes ne unki maa se kaha ki ve unhen phir se skool bhej den taaki ve apni shiksha ko puraa kar saken
 Inspired by his desire for revenge against a schoolboy, he became a top-ranked student
 june 1661 main, unhen trinity college, cambridge main ek sijar-ek prakaar kii kaary-adhyayan bhoomika, ke rup main bhartee kiya gaya
 The teachings of the college at that time were based on Aristotle
 lekin newton adhik aadhunik darshanikon jaise descartes or khagolavidon jaise kopernicus, galileo or kepler ke vichaaron ko padhnaa chahta tha
 In 1665 he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory later known as the Altaipal calculus
 agast 1665 main jaise hi newton ne apni degree praapt kii, uske thik baad plig kii bheeshan mahamari se bachane ke liye ehtiyaat ke rup main vishvavidhyalay ko band kar diya
yadhyapi ve ek cambridge vidhyaarthee ke rup main pratishthit nahin the, iske baad ke do varshon tak unhone woolsthorpe main apane ghar par nijee adhyayan kiya or kalan, prakaashiki or gurutvkarshan ke niyamon par apane siddhanton kaa vikaas kiya
 In 1667 he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of Trinity
 adhikansh aadhunik itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki newton or libanij ne atyalp kalan kaa vikaas apane apane adwitiya sanketanon kaa upyog karte hue swatantra rup se kiya
 According to Newton's inner circle, Newton developed his method many years before Leibniz, but he did not publish any of his works until about 1693 and did not give a complete account of his work until 1704
 Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684
 In addition, Leibniz's notations and "methods of differentiation" were universally adopted on the continent and, after 1820, were also adopted in the British Empire
 jabaki libanij kii pustikaayen praarambhik avasthaaon se paripakvata tak vichaaron ke aadhunikeekaran ko darshaati hai, newton ke gyaat nots main keval antim parinaam hi he
 Newton said that he did not want to publish his calculus because he was afraid he would become a character of ridicule
 newton kaa swiss ganitagya nicholas fatiyo de duiliar ke saath bahut kareebi rishta tha, jo prarambh se hi newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant se bahut prabhavit the
 In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never completed it
 However, the relationship between these two men changed in 1693
 is samay, duiliar ne bhi libanij ke saath kai patron kaa aadan pradaan kiya tha
 In early 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the controversy was fully revealed in 1711
 newton kii royal socity ne ek adhyayan dwaara ghoshnaa kii ki newton hi sachche avishkaarak the or libanij ne dhokhadhadi kii thi
 The study came under suspicion when it was later found that Newton himself wrote commentary on the study's conclusion on Leibniz
 is prakaar kadava newton banaam libanij vivaad shuru ho gaya, jo baad main newton or libanij donon ke jivan main 1716 main libanij kii mrityu tak jari rahaa
 Newton is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, which is valid for any power
 unhone newton kii sarvasamikaon, newton kii vidhi, vargeekrut ghan samtal vakr kii khoj kii, parimit antaron ke siddhant main mahatvapurn yogadan diya, ve pehle vyakti the jinhone bhinnaatmak suchakank kaa prayog kiya or diophentin samikarnon ke hal ko vyutpann karne ke liye nirdeshaank jyamiti kaa upyog kiya
 He approximated the partial sum of the harmonic series by logarithms, and was the first to use the power series with confidence and the power of the power series
 unhen 1669 main ganit kaa leukesian professor chunaa gaya
 In those days, any member of Cambridge or Oxford was required to be a designated English priest
 haalaanki, leukesian professor ke liye jaruri tha ki vah carch main sakriy na ho
 Newton argued that he should be exempt from the need for coordination, and Charles II, whose permission was mandatory, accepted this argument
 is prakaar se newton ke dharmik vichaaron or angreji rudhiwaadiyon ke bich sangharsh tal gaya
 From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics
 During this period he discovered refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism dissects white light into a spectrum of colors, and a lens and a second prism combine white spectrum to form white light
 unhone yah bhi dikhaaya ki rangeen prakaash ko alag karne or bhinn vastuon par chamakaane se ragin prakaash ke gunon main koi parivartan nahin aata he
 Newton described that whether it is reflected, or radiated or transmitted, it remains of the same color
 is prakaar se, unhone dekha ki, rang pehle se rangeen prakaash ke saath vastu kii antarkriya kaa parinaam hota he naaki vasteen khud rangon ko utpann karti hai
 This is known as Newton's color theory
 is kaary se unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki, kisi bhi apvarti doordarshee kaa lens prakaash ke rangon main visaran kaa anubhav karegaa or is avadharana ko siddh karne ke liye unhone abhidrishyak ke rup main ek darpan kaa upyog karte hue, ek doordarshee kaa nirmaan kiya, taaki is samasya ko hal kiya ja sake
 darasal dizin ke nirmaan ke anusaar, pehla gyaat kriyaatmak paravarti doordarshee, aaj ek neutonian doorabeen ke rup main janaa jaataa he, isamen takanic ko aakaar dena tathaa ek upyukt darpan padaarth kii samasya ko hal karnaa shaamil he
 Newton based his mirror on a custom outfit of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to test the quality of optics for his telescope
 farvari 1669 tak ve rangeen vipathan ke bina ek upkaran kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham ho gaye
 In 1671 the Royal Society asked him to demonstrate his reflecting telescope
 un logon kii ruchi ne unhen apni tippaniyon on color ke prakaashan hetu protsaahit kiya, jise baad main unhone apni optics ke rup main vistrut kar diya
 When Robert Hooke criticized some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he dropped out of public debate
 hook kii mrityu tak donon dushman bane rahe
 Newton argued that light is made up of particles or superfluous particles, which refract as they pass through the dense medium, but it was necessary to correlate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light
 
 baad main bhautikavidon ne prakaash ke vivartan ke liye shuddh tarang jaise spashtikaran kaa samarthan kiya
 Today's quantum mechanics, the idea of photons and wave-particle coupling, bear little resemblance to Newton's understanding of light
 1675 kii unki prakaash kii pariklpana main newton ne kanon ke bich bal ke sthaanantaran hetu, ether kii upasthiti ko manjuur kiya
 His interest in alchemy revived after coming into contact with the theologian Henry More
 unhone ether ko kanon ke bich aakarshan or pratikarshan ke vayuruddh vichaaron par aadhaarit gupt balon se pratisthapit kar diya
 jon menard kenez, jinhone rasayan vidya par newton ke kai lekhon ko sweekaar kiya, kehete hai ki "newton kaaran ke yug ke pehle vyakti nahin the: ve jaaduugaron main aakhri number par the
 "newton's interest in alchemy cannot be distinguished from his contributions to science

 In 1704 Newton published Optics, in which he explained in detail his theory of microscopic particles of light
 He considered light to be made up of very fine particles, whereas ordinary matter is made up of large particles and he said that a Through the type of chemical conversion "gross bodies and light cannot transform into each other, xxrep 7 
 and bodies from particles of light Can't get the most of their activity, who enters their organization? " Newton created a prototype form of a frictionless electrostatic generator, using a glass globe

 Thus, ordered and dynamically informed cosmologies Was understandable and should be understood by an active cause
 In his correspondence, Newton claimed that Prine Time "writes Sipia i had an eye upon such principles, in order to be considered faith in God and man
" He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: such wonderful uniformity in the planetary system should be allowed the effect of choice

 Newton perfected Boyle's ideas through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, he was very successful in popularizing them
 Newton transformed an interventionist God-controlled world into a world artistically created by God with rational and universal principles

 According to Newton's third law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction
 iskaa arth yah he ki jab bhi ek vastu kisi duusari vastu par ek bal lagaati he tab duusari vastu vipareet disha main pehali vastu par utana hi bal lagati he
 a common example of this is two ice skates move opposite to each other and then slide in opposite directions

 Since the objects in question do not necessarily have the same mass, the resulting acceleration of the two objects may be different

 For example, the second law also applies to planets and a falling stone
 duusare niyam kii sadish prakruti bal kii disha or vastu ke samveg main parivartan ke prakaar ke bich ek jyamitiya sambandh sthapit karti he
 Before Newton, it was generally believed that for a planet rotating around the Sun, a forward force was required which caused it to move
 newton ne darshaya ki is ke bajaay surya kaa andar kii or ek aakarshan bal aavashyak hota he
 Even several decades after the publication of the Principia, this idea was not universally accepted
 or kai vaigyanikon ne descartes ke vortices ke siddhant ko variyata di
 Newton himself often told a story that upon seeing a falling apple from a tree, he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravity
 baad main vyangy karne ke liye aise cartoon banaaye gaye jinamein seb ko newton ke sar par girte hue bataaya gaya or yah darshaya gaya ki isi ke prabhaav ne kisi tarah se newton ko gurutv ke bal se parichit karaayaa
 unki pustikaon se gyaat hua ki 1660 ke antim samay main newton kaa yah vichaar tha ki sthaliy gurutv kaa vistaar hota he, yah chandramaa ke varg vyutkramanupati hota he; haalaanki purna siddhant ko viksit karne main unhen do dashak kaa samay laga
 John Kanaduyt, who was Newton's associate at the Royal Mint and also the husband of Newton's niece, described the incident when he wrote about Newton's life: 1666 main ve cambridge se phir se sevanivrutt ho gaye or apni maa ke paas linkanshair chale gaye
 As he was walking in a garden, he got an idea that the power of gravity is not limited to a certain distance from the earth, but this power can extend far beyond what was previously thought
 unhone apane aap se kaha ki kya aisa utana upar bhi hoga jitna upar chaand he or yadi aisa he to, yah uski gati ko prabhavit karegaa or sambhavatya use uski kaksha main banaaye rakhega, ve jo gananaa kar rahe the, is tark kaa kya prabhaav hua
 The question was not about the existence of gravity, but whether this force is so wide that it is responsible for keeping the moon in its orbit
 newton ne darshaya ki yadi bal duuri ke varg vyutkram main kam hota he to, chandramaa kii kakshiya avadhi kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or acha parinaam praapt ho saktaa he
 He speculated that this force is responsible for other orbital motion and hence gave it the name of universal gravitation
 ek samakaleen lekhak, wiliam stukele, sar ijac newton kii zindagi ko apane samaran main ricord karte hai, ve 15 april 1726 ko kencinghton main newton ke saath hui baatcheet ko yaad karte hai, jab newton ne zikr kiya ki "unke dimag main gurutv kaa vichaar pehle kab aayaa
 This happened because of an apple falling while he was sitting in meditation posture
 kyon yah seb hameshaa bhoomi ke saapeksh lambavat main hi kyon girtaa he? aisa unhone apane aap main sochaa
 Why it does not move to the side or up, but always falls towards the center of the earth

 The various trees are claimed to be "that" apple tree which Newton has described
 di kings skool, grantham daawa karata he ki yah ped skool ke dwaara kharid liya gaya tha, kuch saalon baad ise jad sahit laakar pradhanadhyaapak ke bageeche main laga diya gaya
 The current staff at the National Trust, which owns Woolstrop Manor, disputs this, and claims that the tree is present in their garden about which Newton talked

 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to proceed
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles
 tolastoy ke 'jivan-shikshak' hone kaa jhooth udaarataavaadiyon kii dekha-dekhi kuch bhootpurv saamaajik-janavaadee bhi duhara rahe hai
 The Russian people will gain independence only if they understand that they have to learn to fight for a better life, not from Tolstoy, but from a class whose importance Tolstoy could not understand and that old world, which Tolstoy hated
 , Is the only class capable of overthrow - that is, from the proletariat
 22 janvari 1911 ko lenin ne punah vistaar se tolastoy kii kuch kathatmak rachanaaon ke saath-saath anek cathetar rachanaaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastowad main pratikriyaavaadi tathaa utapian tatv hone ke baavjood aaj se 25 varsh pehle janata ke kuch halkon ke liye shaayad kabhi-kabhi tolastoy ke siddhanton ke aalochanatmak tatwon kii vyavhaarik upyogita ho sakati thi

 'yaksha' worship was an integral part of the then folk religion
 sanskrit, pali or praakrit sahitya main 'yaksha' puja kaa varnan vishad rup main varnit he
 According to the Puranas, the task of the Yakshas was to disturb the sinners, to make them suffer, as well as to protect their territory
 1 mathura se is prakaar ke yakshm or yakshaniyon kii 6 pratimaaen praapt ho chuki hai
 2 of which the most important is the recorded Yaksha idol found from a village named 'parakham'
 dhoti or dupatta dhaaran kiye sthulkaay 'manibhadra yaksha' sthand avasthaa main he
 Worshiping this Yaksha was very popular at that time
 isaki ek vishalkay pratimaa madhyapradesh ke 'pavaya' gram se bhi praapt hui he, jo vartmaan samay main gwalior ke sangrahalay main pradarshit he
 The Yaksha statue of Mathura is famous in the Indian art world by the name of 'parakham Yaksha'
 shaareerik bal or samarthy kii abhivyanjak pracheen kaal kii ye yaksha pratimaaen keval lok kala ke udhaaharan hi nahin apitu uttar kaal main nirmit bodhisattva, vishnu, kuber, naag aadi dev pratimaaon ke nirmaan kii prericas bhi hai
 By reaching the Sunga and Saka Kshatrapas, Mathura got the form of a Sanskrit center
 jainon kaa dev nirmit stupa, jo aaj sangrahalay sankhya ke 'kankali' tile par virajman tha, us kaal main vidhman tha
 3 Three articles of this time, which are related to Jainism, have so far met Mathura

 Punjabi can mean: samskruti main: other: akeshwarwad athwa ekadevvaad vah siddhanth he jo 'ishwar ek he' athwa 'ek ishwar he' vichaar ko sarvapramukh rup main manyata detaa he
 The monotheist believes in only one God and only worships him
 iske saath hi vah kisi bhi aisi anya alokik shakti yaa devtaa ko nahin maanata jo us ishwar kaa samakaksh ho sake athwa uskaa sthaan le sake
 Accordingly, polytheism is called the opposite principle of monotheism
 akeshwarwad ke virdohi darshanik matvaadon main darshanik sarveshwarawad, darshanik nirishwarwad tathaa darshanik ndehwaad kii gananaa kii jaati he
 Sarveshvaradism assumes an integrality between God and the world
 uske siddhanthavakya hai- 'sab ishwar hai' tathaa 'ishwar sab hai'
 Monotheism only assumes the authority of one God
 sarveshwarawad ishwar or jagat donon kii satta maanata he
 Although there is validity in the nature of the power of the world, but one definitely accepts the unity of God and the world
 'ishwar ek he' vaakya kii sookshm darshanik mimasaa karne par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki sarvasatta ishwar he
 This conclusion is close to Sarveshvarism
 isiilie ye vaakya ek hi tathy ko do dhang se prakat karte hai
 a comparative study of these shows that the sentence 'god is one' indicates the fullness of God, while the sentence 'all is God' is towards the omnipresence of God
 deshkalgat prabhaav kii drushti se vichaar karne par ishwar ke teen visham roopon ke anusaar teen prakaar ke akeshwarwad kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he- Of these, the third monotheism is the most widespread and it is very closely related to Sarveshvarism
 yah siddhant keval ishwar kii hi purna satta par jor nahin detaa, apitu jagat kii asatta par bhi jor detaa he; kintu vibhinn darshanik drushtiyon se vah jagat kii satta or asatta donon kaa do prakaar ke satyon ke rup main pratipaadan bhi karata he
 Due to the equal emphasis on the inability of the world, some people consider the use of the term 'monism' more relevant for Hindu Sarveshvarism, seeing it near monotheism
 is drushti se jagat kii satta keval pratiti maatr he
 Historically many characteristics are seen in Hindu monotheism
 kalanusaar unke anek rup milte hai
 Sarveshvarism and polytheism are closely interlinked
 kuch log vikascram kii drushti se bahudevvaad ko sarvapratham sthaan dete hai
 In the development of Indian religion and contemplation, one can imagine the ultimate power of polytheism in the early Vedic era and behind all the gods in the later Vedic age
 duusare mat se yadhyapi vaidic devataaon ke bahutv ko dekhakar saamaanya pathak vedon ko bahudevvaadi kah saktaa he tathaapi prabud adhyeta ko unamem na to bahudevvaad kaa darshan hoga or na hi akeshwarwad kaa
 That is such a state of Indian apostasy that both of them can be considered as an example
 vastut: yah dharmik sthiti itani viksit nahin thi ki ukt donon main se kisi ek kii ore vah unmukh ho sake
 But as the tendency towards the seriousness of the religion grew, so too did the tendency of Indian thought towards monotheism
 karmkandi karm swat: apana fal pradaan karte hai, is dharna ne bhi bahudevvaad ke devataaon kii mahatta ko kam kiya
 In the Upanishad period, the thinking of a god or power became dominant when theology was propagated
 puranakaal main anek devataaon kii manyata hote hue bhi, unamem se kisi ek ko pradhan maanakar uski upasna par jor diya gaya
 After the predominance of Vedanta philosophy, polytheistic beliefs became even more debilitated and the principle of a single God or power became prominent
 inhen aadhaaron par kuch log akeshwarwad ko gambhir chintna kaa fal maanate hai
 In fact, considering the entire Indian religion, thinking and literature, the prevalence of Sarveshwarism is universally reflected
 yah bhartiya matvaad yadhyapi janprachlit bahudevvaad se bahut dur he tathaapi anya deshon kii tarah yahan bhi sarveshwarawad bahudevvaad se naikatay sthapit kar rahaa he
 The Mahabharata's Narayaniyopakhyana describes the white continent as endowed with monotheistic devotion
 vishvaksen samhita ne vaidikon kii, ekadevvaadi na hone tathaa vaidic karmkandi vidhaanon main vishwaas karne ke kaaran, katu aalochana kii he
 Similarly, another form of monotheism is found in Indian religious practice
 pehle brahma, vishnu or mahesh kii vibhinnata pratipaadit ho gai, saath hi kahin-kahin vishnu or brahma ko shiv main samavisht bhi mana gaya
 Over time, a sense of unity also developed
 keval shiv main hi shesh donon devataaon ke gunon kaa aarope ho gaya
 a similar allegation is found in relation to Vishnu
 vishnupurana to teenon ko ek paramatma kii abhivyakti maanata he
 This divine is somewhere in the form of Shiva and somewhere in the form of Vishnu
 doosraa atiprasiddh akeshwarwad islamic he
 Only by accepting the power of God, does it believe that polytheism is a great sin
 ishwar ek he
 There is no other authority other than that
 vah sarvashaktiman he, athulaneey he, swapam he, sarvathit he
 He is the cause and creator of this world
 vah avatar nahin letaa
 He is eternal and infinite beyond the time of the land, but is nirguna and monogamous
 islam ke hi antargat viksit sufi mat main in vichaaron ke atirikt use sarvyaapee satta bhi mana gaya
 Everywhere there is a vision of his personalities
 parinamat: un logon ne paramatma kaa nivas sabamein or sabakaa nivas paramatma main mana
 This is an indication of the evolution from monotheism to Sarveshwarism, although its differences from the original Islamic monotheism here also appear to be obvious
