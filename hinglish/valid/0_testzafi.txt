 maheshwar sutara ko sanskrit vyakaran kaa aadhaar mana jaataa he
 In order to refine and regularize the present form of Sanskrit language, Panini incorporated various components and components of the language such as phonetics, name, designation, verb, prefix, prefix, sentence, gender, etc
 and their interrelations in the Ashtadhyayi
 is
 ashtaadhi main 32 paad hai jo aath adhyyon me samaan rup se vibhakt hai In this important book of grammar, Panini has given a comprehensive and thorough discussion of the huge collection of the divisive-dominated Sanskrit language in about 4000 sutras, which are divided into eight chapters
 tatkaaleen samaaj me lekhan saamagree kii dushprapyata ko dhyaan main rakhte hue panini ne vyakaran ko smritigamya banane ke liye sutara style kii sahaayta lee he
 Again, Panini has used many tools from his predecessor grammar as well as himself, to make the discussion very brief, of which the Shivasutra or Maheshwar Sutras are the most important
 maheshwar sutron kii utpatti bhagwaan nataraj ke dwaara kiye gayi tandav nrity se maani gayi he
 That is to say, "on the expiration of the dance, Nataraj played the damper nine times for the attainment and fulfillment of the wishes of the Sanakadi sages
 is prakaar chaudaa shivasutron kaa ye jaal prakat huyi
 " damru ke chaudaa baar bajaane se chaudaa sutron ke rup main dhvaniyaan nikali, inhen dhvaniyon se vyakaran kaa prakaatya hua
 That is why Lord Nataraja, the originator of grammar formulas, is considered
 prasiddhi he ki maharishi panini ne in sutron ko devadhidev shiv ke aashirwad se praapt kiya jo ki panineey sanskrit vyakaran kaa aadhaar bana

 Light uparyuktt 14 sutron main sanskrit bhashaa ke varnon ko ek vishisht prakaar se sanyojit kiya gaya he
 As a result, whenever Pāिini needs to use any particular group of characters in the interpretation of words or rules, they take those letters from the Maheshwar Sutras in an abbreviated form
 maheshwar sutron ko isi kaaran ‘pratyaahaar vidhayak’ sutara bhi kehete hai
 His method of making pratihar and his multiple uses in Sanskrit grammar is further shown
 in 14 sutron main sanskrit bhashaa ke samast varnon ko samavesh kiya gaya he
 In the first 4 sutras, vowel characters and remaining 10 sutra consonant characters are counted
 sankshep main swar varnon ko ach evam vyanjan varnon ko hal kaha jaataa he
 Good and light are also pratyahar
 pratyaahaar kaa arth hota he – sankshipt kathan
 Panini has instructed the method of making pratyahara by the 'adirantyen Saheta' sutra, the 71st formula of the first foot of the first chapter of Ashtadhyayi
 adirantyen saheta : aadi varna antim it varna ke saath milakar pratyaahaar banaata he jo aadi varna evam itsanjyak antim varna ke purv aae hue varnon kaa samshti rup main bodh karaata he
 Example: Ach = Aa Pratihar is made by using the initial letter 'A' of the first Maheshwar Sutra 'aiun' with the last letter 'A' of the fourth sutra 'aiuch'
 yah ach pratyaahaar apane aadi akshar ‘a’ se lekar itsanjyak ch ke purv aane vaale ou paryant sabhi aksharon kaa bodh karaata he
 Hence, ach = a i u ri e i o ou
 Similarly, the attainment of light pratyahar is achieved by mixing the initial letter of the 5th sutra hayavart with the last letter of the 14th sutra hal
 faltah, In all the above 14 sutras, Panini has given the last letter as it
 it sangya hone se in antim varnon kaa upyog pratyaahaar banane ke liye keval anubandh hetu kiya jaataa he, lekin vyakaraniya prakriya me inaki gananaa nahi kii jaati he arthath inkaa prayog nahi hota he

 The exclusive right to complete control of power or dominance over a geographical area or group of people is called sovereignty
 saarvbhaum sarvocch vidhi nirmaataa evam niyantrak hota he yani samprabhutaa rajya kii sarvocch shakti he
 The rise of the modern state in Europe resulted in the concept of 'sovereignty' in the seventeenth century
 madhya europe main europee rajshahiyon or samrajyon main satta raja, pope or saamanton ke bich banti rahati thi
 The decline of the recognition of the Catholic Church in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries led to the disintegration of feudalism and the rise of Protestant faith gave sovereign states a chance to flourish
 samprabhutaa kaa matlab he - 'sampoorn or aseemit satta'
 But its implications are not so simple
 mahaz is arth se yah pataa nahin chalata ki akhir is sampoorn satta kii sanrachana main kya-kya shaamil he? kya iskaa matlab kisi sarvocch vaidhanik praadhikaar se hota he yaa phir iskaa sambandh ek aisi raajnneetik satta se he jise chunauti na di ja sake? Due to similar disputes over the meaning of sovereignty, it has been understood since the nineteenth century by dividing it into two parts: legal sovereignty and political sovereignty
 is avadharana ko vyaavhaarik rup se aantarik samprabhutaa or bahya samprabhutaa ke taur par bhi grahan kiya jaataa he
 The internal version of sovereignty means the division of power within the state, the supreme power within the political system
 bahya sanskaran kaa taatpary he antarrashtriya vyavastha ke tahat rajya dwaara ek swatantra or swytt vajood kii tarah sakriy rah paane kii kshamta kaa pradarshan

 There is an intellectual history of the difference between legal and political sovereignty which has to be looked at to understand the differences between Jean Boaden and Thomas Hobbes
 bodaan ne apni rachana da sicks books of kaamanvil main ek aise samprabhu ke paksh main tark diya he jo khud kanoon banaata he, par swayan ko un kanoonon ke upar rakhata he
 According to this view, law means to run people on the orders of the sovereign
 iskaa matlab yah nahin bodaan yahan kisi nirankush shaasha kii vakaalat karnaa chaahate the
 He believed that the sovereign ruler who made and complied with the law would be subject to a higher law
 yani loukik shaasha ke praadhikaar par daivi kanoon kii muhar zaruri hogi
 Contrary to Bodan's view, Hobbes in his composition Leviathan describes the idea of sovereignty not in terms of authority, but in terms of power
 hobbs se pehle saint augusteen ne ek aise samprabhu kii zarurat par bal diya tha jo maanavtaa main antarnihit naitik buraaiyon ko kaabo main rakhega
 Further developing this logic, Hobbes, while defining sovereignty as a monopoly on the oppressive power, recommended that this power should be in the hands of the ruler alone
 haalaanki hobbs nirbaadh rajshahi ko praathamikta dete the, par ve yah maanane ke liye bhi taiyaar the yah satta shaskaon ke ek chote se gut yaa kisi loktantric sabha ke haath main bhi ho sakati he
 This debate between Bodas and Hobbes suggests that legal sovereignty rests on state law as paramount
 iske vipareet raajnneetik samprabhutaa satta ke vaastavik vitaran se judi hui he
 Despite this difference, one also has to believe that the practical notion of sovereignty has legal aspects as well as political aspects
 aadhunik rajyon kii samprabhutaa kanoon kii sarvoparita par bhi nirbhar he or us kanoon kaa anupaalan karwaane vaale sattamulak tantra par bhi jiske paas damankaaree mashinari hoti he
 No law applies merely on the basis of moral obligations
 dand dene vaali vyavastha, police, jail or adaalaton ke bina use kaayam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This equation of legal and political sovereignty seems to be effective on both sides
 kanoon ko apane anupaalan ke liye agar satta ke tantra kii zarurat he, to satta ko apni vaidhata ke liye kanoon kii sanstuti kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Governance has to be lawful and constitutional, only then its legitimacy is maintained
 keval raajnneetik samprabhutaa ke dam par taanashaah sarkarein hi kaam karti hai
 If the government is democratic then its oppressive machinery has to remain accountable before the courts by staying within the boundaries of law
 samprabhutaa ke aantarik swaroop ke prashn par raajnneetik siddhant ke daayaron main kaafii bahes hui he
 After all, what should be the place of supreme and unlimited power? Would it be better to place it in the hands of one ruler or would it be better to have its center vested in a representative institution? In the seventeenth century, Emperor Louis Fourteenth of France told Darp that i am the kingdom
 ek vyakti ke haath main samprabhutaa dene ke peeche tark yah he ki us surat main samprabhutaa ke avibhajya hone kaa guarantee rahegi
 His expression will be in one voice and no other authority will interfere in it
 samprabhutaa kii is sarvasattavadi dharna main prabhaavshaalee hastkshep attharahavin sadi main kiya gaya jab jyaan-zaak ruso ne lokapriy samprabhutaa kii avadharana pesh kii
 Russo, rejecting the rule of the monarchy, wrote in his composition Social Contract: 'man is born free, but everywhere he is held in chains
 ’ darasal, soshal kantrect aadhunik raajnneetik darshan ko ekadam nayaa rup de detii he
 Their social agreement is different from Hobbes and Locke's social settlement
 ruso se pehle ke darshanikon kaa yakeen tha ki manushya apni buddhigat kshamtaaon ke kaaran duusare praaniyon se bhinn he, jabaki ruso maanate hai ki insaan naitik chunaav kii kshamta ke kaaran alag he
 If he is not given the freedom to make this election, he will be nothing more than a slave
 chunki samaaj tarah-tarah kii a-swatantraaaon se bharaa hua he or manushya apni prakritik swatantraaa ke shuruaati sansar main nahin laut saktaa, isliye ruso tajaviz karte hai ki use apni us azaadi kaa vinimay naagarik swatantraaa se karnaa chahie
 For this, human beings will have to form associations with each other, social existence will be created under which all people will relinquish their rights and in turn get rights as citizens, will remain as members of one sovereign
 arthath ek samvidhan bananaa padegaa jiske tahat har vyakti adheen bhi hoga or sahabhaagi naagarik bhi
 Only this way freedom can be guaranteed
 yah loktantr kii avadharana thi, par ruso janata ke pratinidhiyon dwaara chalaaye jane vaale loktantr yaa vidhi-nirmaan se sahamat nahin the
 Like the direct democracy of ancient Greece, Rousseau wanted all citizens to congregate in a public place and formulate a law
 alpamat ko bahumat dwaara liye gayi nirnay ke adheen hone se bachaane ke liye ruso ne sarvasammati kaa paksh liya jise kargar banane ke liye unhone apane sabase vikhyath siddhant ‘jan-ichha’ kaa sutrikaran kiya
 Following the law created on the basis of 'public will' meant to follow one's own will
 ruso dwaara pravartit ‘jan-ichha’ kaa siddhant aage chal kar aadhunik loktantric siddhant kaa aadhaar bana
 Rousseau envisioned a comfortable community of citizens who would be the bearers of equality and unity beyond high-altitude relations, so he believed that it would be easy to provide 'public will' among them
 lekin ruso kabhi is prashn kaa uttar nahin de paye ki nagarikon kii aam sabha main vyakt kii jane vaali ichchhaaon main se ‘jarnal-vil’ kaise niklegi
 Therefore, in the end, they were seen saying that if 'people's will' is not available, then the will of the majority should be considered synonymous
 samprabhutaa ke siddhant ko udaarataavaadi-loktantric vichaar ke pairokaron ne aade haathon bhi liya he
 He says that the notion of sovereignty is unnecessary in the context of pluralistic and democratic governance
 ye log samprabhutaa ke vichaar ko uske sarvasattavadi ateet se peedit or isliye avaanchhneeya maanate hai
 He says that democratic governments are not run by the allegedly lawful regime imposed by the oppressive machinery
 ve to niyantran or santulan ke sameekaran or uske aadhaar par bane network ke zariye shashan karti hai
 Indeed, in modern states with a federal character, it is very difficult to determine the center of internal sovereignty
 sanyukt rajya america, canada, osterelia or bharat jaise sanghatmak rajyon main sarkaar do staron main vibhajit he or prayek str ke paas apane swytt adhikaar hai
 Sovereignty in such states emerges as a partnership between the center and the periphery
 aisi paristhiti main agar koi avibhajit samprabhu he to vah he samvidhan jo centre ko bhi samprabhutaa sampann banaata he or rajyon ko bhi
 External sovereignty signifies the status of a state in the international system
 is tarah kii paristhitiyaan bhi hoti hai ki kisi rajya main aantarik samprabhutaa par vivaad chalata rahata he, par antarrashtriya kshetra main uski bahya samprabhutaa kaa aadar kiya jaataa he
 Anyway, in the era of democracies, issues of internal sovereignty are no longer considered so important, but the question of external sovereignty has become more important than ever
 aise kai antarrashtriya vivaad hai jinamein ek desh kii samprabhutaa kaa daawa duusare desh kii taraf se apni samprabhutaa ke liye chunauti ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The movement by the Palestinians for their sovereign nation is considered by Israel to be the cause of the decline of its sovereignty

 Asir province, known as Mintaqah Asir in formal Arabic, is a province in the southwest corner of Saudi Arabia
 isaki ek choti si sarhad yaman ke desh ke saath bhi lagati he
 Asir province is named after a confederation of tribes living here
 rajdhani abaha ke alaava khamis mushait , qal xxrep 4 a t bishah or bariq yahan ke kuch anya pramukh shahar hai
 The Asir region is situated on a high plateau where more than the rest of Saudi Arabia receives rain

 This rainfall mainly falls twice a year - first in March – April and then in summer
 taapmaana bahut girtaa-utarataa he
 In the afternoon, there is often more than 30 ° c heat whereas in the morning it can go around zero
 subah ke samay koharaa padana aam he
 Due to the availability of water from rain and fog, dense angular forests are also present in some areas, although wind and sun are very dry on the open stone areas
 aseer main genhu or falon kii kheti chalati he or aadhunik kaal main sinchai acchhee hone se is main vistaar hua he
 Asir province is divided into 6 districts: aseer praant ke log isi ilaake main prachinkaal se basane vaale qabeelon ke vanshaj hai
 These include the tribal confederation named 'asir' or 'asariah', after whom the entire region is named
 inke alaava yahan qahtaan, bariq / bareg, bal-garn, shahran, bani shahar, rijaal alma, rijaal al-hajr, bal-asamaar, bal-ahmer or anya qabeele bhi yahan basate hai
 The people here speak some ancient dialects of Arabic language among themselves
 aseer ke log apane nivas- sthaan ke hisaab se teen guton main baante gaye hai: unche pathaar ke 'saraat' qabeele, tihamah qabeele or purvi registani kshetra main basane vaale badiyah qabeele
 Many large tribes have Sarat, Tihamah and Badiyah branches
 pahari kshetron main basane waalon ke taur-tareeqe najd kshetra ke logon se milte-julate hai

 An imaginary number is a number written as the imaginary unit i { \ displaystyle i} multiplied by the real number, defined by its property i 2 = - 1 { \ displaystyle i ^ {2} = - 1} 
 ek kaalpanik sankhya kaa varg shunya athwa rinatmak hota he
 For example 5 i { \ displaystyle 5i} is an imaginary number whose square is - 25 { \ displaystyle -25}

 The product of the square roots of negative numbers must be used carefully
 udhaaharan ke liye nimna vidhi galat he: The rationale is that in mathematics xy = xy { \ displaystyle { \ sqrt {x}} { \ sqrt {y}} = { \ sqrt {xy}}}, where the main value of the square root is the instance when At least one of the numbers x and y is positive, this is not the case here

 Sudhi thinkers like Pt
 Banarsidas Chaturvedi had taken the first significant step to flourish and flourish the mode of interview
 unki saahitiyik sevaaon ke liye unhen padmabhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 He was a pioneer editor of his time and is known for his distinguished and independent instinct
 unke jaisaa shaheedon kii smriti kaa puraskarta or chhayavaad kaa virdohi samooche hindi sahitya main koi or nahin hua
 In his memory, Banarsidas Chaturvedi is honored
 kehete hai ki ve kisi bhi nai saamaajik, saanskrithik, saahitiyik yaa rashtriya muhim se judane, nae kaam main haath daalane yaa nai rachana main pravrutt hone se pehle swayan se ek hi prashn poochhate the ki usase desh, samaaj, uski bhashaaon or saahitiyon, visheshkar hindi kaa kuch bhala hoga yaa maanav jivan ke kisi bhi kshetra main ucchtar mulyon kii pratishtha hogi yaa nahin? Born on December 24 in 1892 AD in Firozabad, Uttar Pradesh, Chaturvedi ji, after passing the Inter examination in 1913, was appointed as a teacher at the Government High School in Farrukhabad, nearby, at a monthly salary of thirty rupees
 lekin abhi kuch hi maheene beete the ki unke guru pandit lakshmidhar vaajapeyi ne unhen adhyaapan chhodkar agra aane or ‘aryamitra’ sanbhaalane kaa aadesh suna diya
 Lakshmidhar Ji used to take out Aryamitra from Agra in those days
 vastav main, vaajapeyi dwarikaprasad sevak ke bulaave par unke masik ‘navajivan’ ke sampadak banane vaale the or ‘aryamitra’ ko aise sampadak ke hawaale kar janaa chaahate the, jo unke bharose par khara utar sake
 Chaturvedi ji had also accepted the permission of Lakshmidhar Vajpayee, but in the meantime he got an order for appointment in that daily college in Indore
 chaturvedi ji ko indore main pehle to da
 sampoornanand kaa saath mila, jo usee college main shikshak the, phir vahaan hindi sahitya sammelan yojit hua to uski adhyakshata karne aae mahatma gandhi ke saannnidhya va sampark ne unki lagaataar baichaiyn rahane vaali sevabhaavana va rachanaatmakataa ko nae aayam die
 When Mahatma Gandhi established the Gujarat Vidyapeeth in 1921, on his orders, Chaturvedi went there to offer his services
 isse pehle gandhiji ne chaturvedi ji se hindi ko rashtrabhasha ke taur par pratishthit karne ke apane abhiyaan ke sandarbh main desh bhar se anek manishiyon ke abhipraay ekatra karwaae, jisko pustakaakaar prakashit kiya gaya
 Chaturvedi ji had written his memoir book 'mere 21 years in Fiji Island' for Totaram Sanadhya during his teaching period in Farrukhabad and only then 'aryamitra', 'bharat Sudha Prantkar', 'navajivan' and 'maryada' etc
 His articles were started appearing in many important magazines and magazines of the time

 Later Chaturvedi ji, through CF Andrews, made a lot of efforts to ensure the end of the plight of these laborers
 kaaka kalelkar ke anusaar rashtriyata ke ubhaar ke un dinon main andrus jaise videshi manishiyon or maanavsevakon kaa sammaan karne kaa chaturvedi ji kaa aagrah bahut saraahneey tha
 He also stayed at Shantiniketan of Rabindranath Tagore for a few days at the invitation of Andrews
 ve andrus ko ‘deenabandhu’ kehete the or unhone unke vyaktitv va krititv par ek anya lekhak ke saath milakar angrezi main bhi ek pustak likhi he, jisaki bhoomika mahatma gandhi dwaara likhi gai he
 But he did not like teaching at all in the sense that there was a lot of stagnation in it, while his creative instincts were looking for a new destination at every step

 us samay kaa birla hi koi hindi sahityakar hoga, jo apni rachanaaen ‘vishaal bharat’ main chhapi dekhne kaa abhilaashi na rahaa ho
 Ramanand Chattopadhyay, the owner of Chaturvedi ji's favorite English paper 'modern Review', was also the owner of 'vishal Bharat'
 ve chaturvedi ji kii sampadan kushalta or vidwata ke kaayal the or chaturvedi ji bhi unka bahut sammaan karte the, lekin sampadakeey asahmati ke avasaron par majaal kya ki chaturvedi ji unka lihaaj karen
 Many such occasions were also discussed
 chaturvedi ji ganeshashankar vidhyaarthee ko mahatma gandhi ke baad apane patrakaariya jivan kii sabase badi prerana maanate the, jinaki unhone jeevani bhi likhi he
 In 1930, he went to Tikamgarh and edited a letter named 'madhukar' on the proposal of Orchha Naresh Veersingh Ju Dev
 naresh ne unhen unke nirvighn va nirbaadh sampadakeey adhikaron ke prati aashwast kar rakhaa tha lekin baad main unhone paaya ki chaturvedi ji ‘madhukar’ ko rashtriya chetana kaa vaahak or saanskrithik kranti kaa agradoot banane kii dhun main kinchit bhi ‘darbari’ nahin rahane de rahe, to uskaa prakaashan rukvaa diya
 After India became independent, Chaturvedi ji was a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha for twelve years and was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1973
 2 may, 1985 ko is duniya se vidaa lene se pehle unhone apane khate main ‘sahitya or jivan’, ‘rekhachitr’, ‘sansmaran’, ‘satyanarayan kaviratn’, ‘bharatbhakt andrus’, ‘keshavachandra sen’, ‘pravasi bharatvasi’, ‘phiji main bhartiya’, ‘phiji kii samasya’, ‘hamaare aradhy’ or ‘sethubandh’ jaisi rachanaaen jamaa kar lee thim
 He undertook many foreign trips and gave special contributions to the flowering-pallavan of many social, cultural and literary institutions and talents in India and abroad
 bhartiya krantikari andolan ke lokapriy lekhak sudhir vidhyaarthee kehete hai ki ve 1972 main chaturvedi ji dwaara sampadit agra ke ‘yuvak’ masik ke ‘swatantraaa sangram yodhank’ se prerit hokar hi krantikariyon kii kirti raksha ke mishan main lage
 He calls Chaturvedi ji as his 'guruvar' and calls himself his 'beloved student'

 anukram kaa 1 / 3 glysine hote hue, iskaa matlab he ki lagbhag colejan anukram kaa aadha bhaag glysine, proline yaa hydroxiproline nahin he, ek tathy jo aksar colejan alpha-peptids ke asaamaanya GXY swabhaav ke vikshep ke kaaran dhyaan main nahin rahata
 is tarah kaa niyamit doharaav or ucch glysine saamagree keval kuch anya tantumay protein main pai jaati he, jaise ki reshmi fibrin
 resham kaa 75-80% 10% cerin or elastin ke saath -gly-ala-gly-ala- he jisamen glysine, proline or elnin prachur maatra main he, jiskaa parshv samooh chota niskriy mithail samooh he
 Such high glycine and regular repeats were never found in globular proteins, except in very short sections of their sequence
 sanrachanaatmak proteinon main rasinic-pratikriyasheel parshv samoohon kii jarurat nahin rahi he, chunki ve enzymon or parivahan proteinon main rahe hai, tathaapi colejan sirf ek sanrachanaatmak protein nahin he
 Because of its important role in determining cell phenotype, cell adhesion, tissue regulation, and infrastructure, cell or matrix cooperation / regulation roles exist in many classes of its non-proline-rich regions
 proline or hydroxiproline kii apekshaakrit ucch saamagree, unke jyamitiya kritrim carboxil or emino samoohon ke saath, glysine kii samrudh maatra sahit, vyaktigat polypeptid ladiyon dwaara bina antahshrinkhalaa hydrogen band ke bina, anayas baayen haath ke heliks rachane ke swabhaav ke kaarak hai
 Because glycine is a small amino acid without side-chain, it plays a unique role in fibrous structural proteins
 colejan main, har tisare sthaan main Gly kii zarurat hoti he, kyonki tripal heliks kaa sangyojan is avshesh ko heliks ke antarang main rakhata he, jahaan glysine ke ekal hydrogen parmaanu ke alaava bade parshv samooh ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 For this reason, the rings of Pro and Hyp must be specified outward
 ye do amino acid tripal Pro kii tulana main heliks-hyp kii sthirataa main madad karte hai—machhlee jaise praaniyon main inaki kam sandratha apekshit he, jinke sharir kaa taapmaana adhikansh niyattapi praaniyon se kam hota he
 The tropocollagen subunits are spontaneously self-assembled, with regular crooked ends, in even larger configurations in the extracellular spaces of tissues
 tantumay colejan main, anu ek duusare se lagbhag 67 nm vichlit hote hai
 Each D-period contains 4 and a fraction of collagen molecules
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki 300 nm ko 67 nm se vibhajit karne par purnank nahin miltaa he
 Therefore, at each D-period repeat of the microtubule, the transverse-cut consists of a five-molecule portion — called "overlap" and a 4-molecule portion called a "gap"
 donon, gap or overlap kshetron main, tripal heliks anuprastha-kaat main shadbhujakar yaa ardh-shadbhujakar vinyas main vyavasthit hote hai

 Several large fibrous bundles are formed with the help of various classes of proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, leading to the formation of a variety of mature tissues by an alternative combination of the same major action elements
 colejan kii avilayata ekalak colejan ke adhyayan ke liye yah paae jane tak baadha rahi he ki chote pashuon se tropocolejan ko nikaala ja saktaa he kyonki ve abhi tak puri tarah tiryak bandhan main nahin hai
 However, advances in microscopy techniques and atomic force microscopy) and X-ray diffraction have enabled researchers to obtain more detailed images of the in situ collagen structure
 baad kii ye unnati yah samajhane ke liye vishesh rup se mahatvapurn he ki koun-si colejan sanrachana koshika-koshika or koshika-matrix sampreshan ko prabhavit karti he tathaa kis prakaar vruddhi or marammat main utakon kaa nirmaan or vikaas tathaa rog main parivartan hota he
 Collagen fibers are semi-crystalline aggregates of collagen molecules
 colejan reshe tantuon ke bandal hai
 Collagen fibers / aggregates are arranged in different combinations and concentrations of different tissues to provide different tissue properties
 asthi main, sampurna colejan tripal heliks ek samanaantar, tede-medhe vinyas main pade rahete hai
 The 40 nm gaps at the ends of tropocollagen subunits probably serve as the nucleus for the deposition of long, strong, fine crystals of the mineral component, which is hydroxyapatite, Ca1062 with some phosphate
 colejan puure sharir main kai sthanon main hota he
 So far, 29 types of collagen have been identified and defined
 tathaapi, sharir main 90% se adhik colejan tip I, II, III or IV ke hote hai
 Collagen-related diseases most commonly result from genetic defects or nutritional deficiencies that affect biosynthesis, combination, post-translational modification, secretion, or other processes involved in normal collagen production
 tip II or XI]] BP180 is also known as 180 kda protein

 Collagen has an unusual amino acid composition and sequence: cortisol twajeey colejan se amino acid ke nimnikraman ko uttejit karata he
 Most collagen is composed in a similar way, but for Type i the following procedure is specific: vitamin c kii kami se scurvy rog hota he, jo ek gambhir or dardanaak beemaari he, jisamen doshapurn colejan majboot sanyoji utak ke gathan ko roktaa he
 The gums become sore and bleed with teeth falling; The skin becomes discolored and wounds do not heal

 Random coils This process describes the formation of gelatin, which is used in many foods including flavored gelatin desserts
 khaadya-padaarthon ke alaava, geltin kaa upyog aushadhiy, cosmetic or photographi udyogon main kiya jaataa he
 Nutritionally, collagen and gelatin are poor quality single sources of protein, since they do not contain all the essential amino acids the human body needs — they are not 'whole proteins'
 Collagen-based dietary supplement manufacturers claim that their products can improve the quality of skin and nails as well as the health of joints
