 a computer file is a class of information collected, or a resource for storing information that is available to a computer program, and is usually based on some kind of durable computer storage
 sanchika tikaoo is lihaaz se hoti he ki yah maujuuda kaarykram ke samaapt hone ke baad bhi anya kaaryakramon dwaara istemaal ke liye maujuud rahati he
 Computer files can traditionally be considered the modern form of paper documents contained in files from offices and libraries, which is why the file is named in English
 nunatam str par kai aadhunik prachaalan pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko keval ek-aiami biton kii shrunkhlaa hi maanati hai
 At a more high level, when the contents of the file are also kept in view, these binomial digits may be considered representing integers, letters, image pixels, sounds, or anything else
 yah sanchika kaa istemaal karne vaale kaarykram par nirbhar he ki vah kis prakaar sanchika kaa arth nikaalata he or jaankaree ke aantarik jamaav ko kaise samajhataa he, taaki prayokta ko or adhik myne rakhane vaali style main isi jaankaree ko prastut kar sake 
 At any given time, the file will have a shape, usually expressed in bytes, and indicate how much space the file has in store
 adhiktar aadhunik prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah aakaar koi bhi arunatmak purnank ho saktaa he, lekin pranali ke anusaar isaki adhiktam seemaa hogi
 But the simple definition of a file does not preclude that its current size has any real meaning, except in the case when the contents of the file are some of the contents within a set of persistent collections
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi unics-samaan pranali main jis sanchika kii ore / bin / ls kii kadi ingit karti he, uskaa aakaar paribhaashit hota he or virale hi badalata he
 Compare this to / dev / null, it is also a file but its size always changes but probably does not matter the same way as in the previous example
 kisi sanganak sanchika main maujuud jaankaree or choti jaankariyon ke pulindon ke rup main ho sakati he yaa chalneey bhi ho sakati he
 It only depends on the creator of the file how the information will be organized in it
 is kaaran se anekon kam maanak vaali sanchika dhaanche maujuud hai jo saralatam se jatiltam tak har prakaar ke makasad ke liye kaam aa sakate hai
 Most computer files are used by computer programs
 ye kaarykram apane istemaal ke liye yathochit sanchikaaye banaate, badalte va mitaate hai
 The program-makers who make these programs decide which files are needed, how they are to be used and their names
 kuch maamalon main sanganak kaarykram sanchikaon main her fer is dhang se karte hai ki ve sanganak prayokta ko dikhti hai
 For example, in the word-processing program, users make changes to document files and the user names them by themselves
 dastauez sanchika kii saamagree is tarah yojit hoti he ki shabd-sansaadhan kaarykram ko vah samaj main aa jaae, lekin prayokta hi uskaa naam va bhandaaran pataa nirdhaarit karata he or bhandaaran kii pramukh jaankaree bhi prayokta hi nirdhaarit karata he
 Many applications push all the content files into a single file and mark them inside to keep track of different types of information
 duum or quek jaise khelon kii saamagree sanchikaaye iskaa ek udhaaharan hai
 On the computer, it is possible to create, modify, extend, shrink, move, and delete files
 adhiktar maamalon main, sanganak kaaryakramon ko sanganak par chalaa kar yah sab kiya jaataa he, par zarurat ho to sanganak kaa prayokta bhi sanchikaon main badlaav kar saktaa he
 For example, Microsoft Word files are usually created by the Microsoft Word program based on user instructions, but the user can also delete, delete, or transfer these files directly through a file manager program such as Windows Explorer
 unics-jaisi pranaaliyon main prayokta-kshetra kii prakriyaayein aamtaur par sidhe sanchikaon se nahin ulajhati hai; prachaalan pranali ek pruthakkaran str pradaan karti he jisaki vajah se prayokta-kshetra kii ore se sanchikaon ke saath kaa lagbhag sara len-dein kathor kadiyon se hota he
 a file can be named by using rigid links; Purely operating systems do not have names of files
 udhaaharan ke liye prayokta-kshetra ke kaarykram kisi sanchika ko mitaa nahin sakate hai, ve keval us sanchika kii kadi ko mitaa sakate hai or yadi ashthi ko yah pataa lagata he ki is sanchika kii ab koi or kadiyaan nahin hai, to vah is sanchika ko mitaa saktaa he
 In fact, only the layer transacts through files, but user-zone requests are done through files in such a way that it remains unknown to user-zone programs
 yun to kaaryakramon kaa sanchikaon ke saath kaa len-dein prachaalan pranali or sanchika pranali ke hisaab se alag alag hota he par mukhyatah yah gatividhiyaan aam hai: In modern computer systems, filenames are commonly used to access files
 kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah naam sanchika se judaa hota he
 In some others, the file itself is anonymous, but named links point to it
 is maamle main prayokta kadi ko hi sanchika kaa naam samaj saktaa he, lekin yah vastav main sahi nahin hoga, khaastaur par jab ek hi sanchika kii ek se adhik kadiyaan hon tab
 The files can be in directories
 lekin behatar yah kahana hoga ki nirdeshika ke andar sanchikaon kii suchi yaa sanchikaon kii kadiyon kii suchi ho sakati he
 Under this definition it is very important to understand that the term "file" also includes directories
 isse nirdeshikaon ke sopan sambhav hote hai, arthath nirdeshikaon ke andar upanirdeshikas
 The name that refers to a file inside a directory must be unique
 lekin kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main naam ke saath prakaar bhi nirdisht hota he jisaki vajah se ek nirdeshika main do alag alag prakaar kii sanchikaayen ek hi naam se sambhav hai jaise ki ek hi naam kii ek nirdeshika va ek sanchika
 In environments in which files are named, the pair of file names and paths must be unique - the names and paths of any two files cannot match the names and paths of any other file
 jahaan sanchika benaam ho, namit sandarbh ek namasthaan ke antargat rahenge
 Most times a name in any namespace will refer to exactly one or zero files
 lekin, koi bhi sanchika kisi namasthaan main shunya, ek yaa adhik naamon se sanderbhit kii ja sakati he
 Depending on the context of the application, the appropriate name for any file or link must be made up of special characters
 sanganak pranali par nirbhar karata he ki yah naam upyukt he yaa nahin
 Early computers allowed a limited number of letters and numbers in a file's name, but modern computers allow long names to contain Unicode characters or Unicode numbers in almost any order, so that the purpose of the file is understood at a glance
 
 kuch sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon main khaali sthaan kii anumati dete hai, kuch nahin
 The ephemeral sensitivity of file names is determined by the file system
 unics sanchika pranaliyaan aamtaur par laghudirghasanvedi hoti hai or prayokta-stareey anuprayogon ko aisi sanchikaaye banane detii hai jinke aksharon main keval laghu or deergh kaa fark ho
 Microsoft Windows offers several file systems, with different policies for short-term sensitivity
 yadi prayokta nirdeshika pravishtion main sanchika naamon ko badalane ke liye discs sampadak kaa istemaal kare to prachlit effeti pranali main kai sanchikaaye ho sakati hai jinke naam main keval deergh-laghu aksharon kaa hi fark ho
 However, user applications generally do not allow this
 adhiktar sanganak, sanchikaon ko sopan ke aadhaar par yojit karte hai or iske liye folder, nirdeshika yaa kaitlog kaa istemaal karte hai
 Whatever the word, the idea is the same
 har folder main kuch sankhya main sanchikaaye ho sakati hai or unamem anya folder ho sakate hai
 These other folders are called subfolders
 inamen or sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai, aadi-aadi, aise kar ke ek vriksh-rupi dhaanchaa nirmit hota he jisamen ek "guru folder" yaa hota he jiske adheen kitne bhi str tak sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai
 Folders can also have names like files
 folderon ke jariye sanchikaon ko taarkik tareeke se yojit karnaa saral ho jaataa he
 Whenever a computer uses folders, each file and folder has not only its own name but also a path that indicates which folder or folders the file or folder is present in
 is path main ek vishesh chihn - jaise ki / - ko jariye sanchika yaa folder naamon ke bich main likhaa jaataa he
 For example in the example in this article, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers indicates that a file named Managers is in a folder called Salaries, and this folder is in Payroll
 sanchika or folder ke naamon ke bich main aage jhuki lakeer he, sarvocch yaa jad folder kaa koi naam nahin he, atah naam aage jhuki lakeer se shuru hota he 
 Many computer systems use extensions in file names, also called file types
 windos sanganakon main vistaar sanchika ke naam ke baad ek bindu or bindu ke aage kuch akshar kaa rup letaa he, ye akshar sanchika ke prakaar kii pahchaan hote hai
 The 
txt extension is the identity of the text file, the 
doc extension is the identity of a document, especially in Microsoft Word file format; Etc
 etc
 sanganak pranali par vistaaron kaa istemaal hone par bhi, sanganak pranali unhen kis had tak pahachaanata he or kis had tak unke anusaar vyavhaar karata he, isamen bhi kaafii vividhta he, kuch pranaaliyon main ye anivaary hai, jabaki kuch or main inke maujuud hone se bhi koi fark nahin padataa, ye nazarandaz kar die jate hai
 Many modern computer systems provide ways to prevent files from getting damaged
 jo sanganak ek se adhik prayoktaaon kii suvidha dete hai ve sanchika anumatiyaan bhi lagu karte hai jinase yah niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he ki koun sanchikaaye va folder bana, mitaa yaa badal saktaa he or koun nahin
 For example, a user may have permission to change a file but not delete it, or to create files and folders but not delete it
 anumatiyon ke jariye yah bhi nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he ki keval kuch hi prayokta kisi sanchika yaa folder kii saamagree dekh saken
 Permissions protect against illegal alteration or destruction of content in files and illegal users can be prevented from viewing certain files to keep private information confidential
 kai sanganakon main ek or bachaav vidhi maujuud hoti he jise "keval pathneey chihn" kehete hai
 When this sign is placed, files can be inspected but cannot be changed
 yah chihn vikat jaankaree ke liye laabhadaayak hota he jise badla yaa mitaayaa nahin janaa chahie, jaise ki sanganak pranali ke aantarik purzon dwaara prayukt kuch vishesh sanchikaon ke liye
 Some systems also include a "hidden sign", which ensures that the file becomes invisible
 is chihn ke jariye sanganak pranali aisi zaruri pranali sanchikaon ko chhipaati he, jinhen prayoktaaon dwaara badla nahin janaa chahie
 In the above discussion, the file is described as a concept for a high level operating system or user
 lekin, kisi bhi sanchika ko vastav main kaam laayak hone ke liye bhautik rup se upasthit hona aavashyak he
 That is, the abstract concept of a file needs to be in the actual physical form in the real computer system, otherwise it does not have to exist
 bhautik rup se adhiktar sanganak sanchikaaye kisi prakaar ke saamagree bhandaaran upkaran main rakhi jaati hai
 Examples are hard jisc, through which most operating systems operate
 adhiktar sanchikaaye inhen main rakhi jaati hai
 Hard disks are the most widely available non-volatile storage device in the early 21st century
 yadi sanchikaon main keval asthaayee saamagree hi ho to unhen areem main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In operating systems like Unix, many files are not directly connected to any physical storage device: / dev / null is a prime example of this, likewise almost all of the files contained within / dev, / proc and / sys are of the same type
 
 inkaa prayokta kshetra main sanchikaon kii tarah prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 But these are virtual files that actually exist only as objects of the operating system's archetype
 sanganak sanchikaon ko chumbakeey pattayon main bhandaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases files can also be stored in other media such as writeable compact discs, digital multivariate disks, zip drives, USB flash drives, etc
 jab sanganak sanchikaon main bahut mahatvapurn jaankaree hote he to pratilipi prakriya ke jariye aisi sthitiyon ko parinaamon se bachane kii koshish kii jaati he jinamein sanchikaaye nasht ho sakati hai
 Copying files simply means keeping the copies of the files in another location so that if something happens to the original computer or they are accidentally erased, they can be returned by copy
 sanchikaon kii prati rakhane ke kai tareeke hai
 Most computer systems provide convenience programs that facilitate the copying process, as it can take a lot of time if many files are to be copied
 sanchikaon ko aksar lekhanyogy sidi yaa cartrij tepon jaise hastantaraneey madhyamon main pratilipit kiya jaataa he
 Copying files to another hard disk of the same computer protects against a malfunction of one disk, but if the entire computer is to be protected against the risk of malfunction or loss, it is necessary to make copies of those files in such medium Which can be taken away from this computer and stored in a safe place
 dada-baap-betaa pratilipi vidhi swachaalit rup se teen pratilipiyaan banaati he, sanchika kii sabase puraani prati dada sanchika hoti he or betaa maujuuda pratilipi
 The system of which files are organized, named, stored and changed by which computer is called its file system
 adhiktar prachaalan pranaaliyon main kam se kam ek sanchika pranali hoti he
 Multiple file systems can be run simultaneously in many operating systems
 udhaaharan ke liye, nae emes windos sanganakon par emes-dos ke puraane effeti-style kii sanchika pranaliyaan samarthit hai or saath hi taaze windos sanskarnon kii prachlit sanchika pranali antiatioes bhi chalati he
 Every system has its advantages and disadvantages
 udhaaharan ke liye maanak effeti main keval 8 akshar ke sanchika naam chalate hai, jabaki antiatioes main lambey sanchika naam sambhav hai jinamein khaali sthaan bhi ho sakate hai
 You can name a file in NTFS like Payroll records but in FAT this name can be something similar to payroll

 sanchika prabandhak kaarykram suvidhadaayak kaarykram hote hai jinke jariye sanchikaon va folderon ko hilaayaa, banaaya, mitaayaa yaa punarnamit kiya ja saktaa he, par ye vastav main aapako sanchika kii saamagree ko padhane yaa saamagree jodne nahin dete hai
 Each computer system provides at least one file manager for its parent file system
 windos main sabase adhik prayukt sanchika prabandhak kaarykram windos explorer he or mike main yah finder he
 Linux has many file managers like Nautilus, Conqueror
 sanchika ke liye prayukt angrezi shabd "fil" kaa sanganak bhandaaran ke sandarbh main prayog 1952 se hi chhidi pattiyon main sanchit jaankaree ke liye shuru ho gaya tha
 In the initial experiment, people used to call the underlying software only file
 udhaaharan ke liye ibiem 350 kii discs drivon ko "discs fil" kaha jaataa tha
 Systems such as the 1962 compatible time sharing system had file systems that displayed multiple "files" on a single cache device, and thus began the modern use of the term
 sitis ke sanchika naamon main do hisse the, ek prayokta-pathneey "pradhan naam" or doosraa "apradhan naam" jo sanchika kaa prakaar bataata tha
 This practice is still practiced by many operating systems, including Microsoft Windows
 yun to aajkal prayukt "register sanchika" sanchikaon kii praarambhik pariklpana darshaati he, kintu yah praayah lupt ho chuki he

 The reservation policy has also been extended to represent Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Parliament of India
 bharat kii centre sarkaar ne ucch shiksha main 27% aarakshan de rakhaa he or vibhinn rajya aarakshanon main vruddhi ke liye kaanoon bana sakate hai
 According to the Supreme Court ruling, no more than 50% reservation can be made, but some states like Rajasthan have proposed 68% reservation, including 14% reservation for forward castes

 The oldest criterion for identifying under-represented groups is caste

 The fundamental principle is that under-representation of identifiable groups is a legacy of the Indian caste system
 bharat kii swatantraaa prapti ke baad bharat ke samvidhan ne pehle ke kuch samoohon ko anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke rup main soochibaddh kiya
 The framers of the Constitution believed that due to the caste system, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes remained historically backward and were not given respect and equal opportunities in Indian society and hence their share in nation-building activities was low

 An additional complication is that some castes / communities that are considered untouchables in one province but not in other provinces

 Proponents of the reservation policy point out that the traditional caste system, which has traditionally run, has severe oppression and segregation for the lower castes and limited their various kinds of freedom, including education

 The status of major decisions and their implementation by Indian courts is given below: praasangik maamle The term creamy layer was first coined in the Kerala State v
 NM Thomas case in 1975 when a judge stated that "the benefits of reservation would be stripped of the top creamy layer of the backward class, thus making the weakest and whole cakes among the weak Except the lucky layers to consume "

 This decision also established the concept of qualitative exclusion, such as the "creamy layer"

 The reservation system in Tamil Nadu is very different from the rest of India; This is not due to the nature of the reservation but because of its history
 may 2006 main jab pehali baar aarakshan kaa jabardast virodh nai dilli main hua, tab chennai main iske vipareet ekadam visham shanti dekhi gayi thi
 Later, the anti-reservation lobby gained precedence in Delhi, protesting in the quiet lane of Chennai demanding reservation

 Currently, in day-to-day practice, reservation is somewhat lower than 69%, depending on how high-numbered seats students from the non-reserved category are admitted
 agar 100 siten uplabdh hai, to pehle samudaay kaa vichaar kiye bina do yogyata suchi taiyaar kii jaati he, 31 siton ke liye ek or 50 siton ke liye ek duusari, kramshah 69% aarakshan or 50% aarakshan ke anuroop

 31 seat list is used as non-reserved open entry list and 69 seats are filled using 69% reservation
 The effective reservation percentage depends on how many non-reserved category students fall in the list of 50 and not in the 31 list
 At one extreme, all 19 may be non-reserved category students, in which case the total reservation becomes 58%; It can also be argued that for non-reserved category students, assuming 19% 'reservation' it becomes / 119 or 74%! At the other extreme, in the list of 31, no 19 are added to the non-reserved category, then no high-numbered seats will be created in this case and 69% reservation will be done as per the state law order

 The languages related among themselves are called language families
 koun bhashaayen kis parivaar main aati hai, inke liye vaigyanik aadhaar hai
 There are three stages in the languages of the world at this time
 vibhinn deshon kii pracheen bhashaayen jinka adhyayan or vargeekaran paryaapt saamagree ke abhaav main nahin ho sakaa he, pehali avasthaa main he
 Their existence is still preserved in the ancient inscriptions, coins and handwritten books available in them
 mesopotemia kii puraani bhashaa ‘sumereey’ tathaa italy kii pracheen bhashaa ‘etrascan’ isi tarah kii bhashaayen hai
 In the second stage, there are modern languages, which have not been able to study and divide despite the abundant material in the absence of proper research
 bask, bushman, japani, korian, andamani aadi bhashaayen isi avasthaa main hai
 There is enough material in the languages of the third stage and they have been studied and classified
 greek, arabi, farsi, sanskrit, angreji aadi anek viksit evam samrudh bhashaayen iske antargat hai
 Language is related to person, society and country
 isliye prayek bhashaa kii nijee visheshta hoti he
 On the basis of these, she establishes equality with some languages on one hand and inequality with many languages on the other
 mukhyatah yah vaishishtagat samya-vaishamy do prakaar kaa hota he–akritimulak or arthtatva sambandhi
 Under the first, the similarity of the shape of the words i
e
 the composition of words and sentences is seen
 duusare main arthtatva kii samanta rahati he
 According to them, there are two methods of classification of languages - morphological and family or historical
 is vivechan kaa sambandh aitihaasik vargeekaran se he isliye uske aadhaaron ko thodaa vistaar se jaan lenaa chahie
 In addition to morphological similarities, it should also have the following similarities
 bhugolic drushti se praayah samipsth bhashaaon main samanta or duurastha bhashaaon main asamanta paayi jaati he
 On this basis, the languages of the world are divided into African, Eurasia, Pacific and oceanic sections
 kintu yah aadhaar bahut adhik vaigyanik nahin he
 Because two adjacent languages can be different from each other and two remote languages are mutually similar
 bharat kii hindi or malayalam do bhinn parivaar kii bhashaayen hai kintu bharat or england jaise duurastha deshon kii sanskrit or angreji ek hi parivaar kii bhashaayen hai
 The languages in which similar words prevail are kept under a clan
 yah samanta bhashaa-bhashiyon kii sameeptha par aadhaarit he or do tarah se sambhav hoti he
 Equality comes when words of the same society, caste or family are treated equally
 iske atirikt jab bhinn desh athwa jati ke log sabhyataa or sadhano ke viksit ho jane par raajnneetik athwa vyavsaayik hetu se ek-duusare ke sampark main aate hai to shabdon ke aadan-pradaan dwaara unamem samanta sthapit ho jaati he
 The first type of conformity is useful for family classification
 kyonki aise shabd bhashaa ke mul shabd hote hai
 In these also, the words nouns, pronouns etc
 used in the family life of Nityaprati are more useful
 is aadhaar main sabase badi kathinaayee yah hoti he ki anya bhashaaon se aaye hue shabd bhashaa ke viksit hote rahane se mul shabdon main aise ghulmil jate hai ki unako pahchaan kar alag karnaa kathin ho jaataa he
 The solution to this difficulty is semantic equality to a extent
 kyonki ek parivaar kii bhashaaon ke anek shabd arth kii drushti se samaan hote hai or aise shabd unhen ek parivaar se sambandhit karte hai
 Therefore, semantic similarity is also an important basis
 prayek bhashaa kaa apana dhwani-siddhanth or uccharan-niyam hota he
 This is why she is not as quickly affected by the sounds of other languages and, as far as possible, replaces them with their nearest sounds according to phonemes
 jaise farsi kii k, kha, fa aadi dhvaniyaan hindi main nikatavarti k, kha, pha aadi main parivartit hoti he
 Hence the basis of phonology is more reliable than syllogism
 vaise kabhi-kabhi ek bhashaa ke dhvanisamooh main duusari bhashaa kii dhvaniyaan bhi milakar viksit ho jaati hai or tulanaatmak nishkarshon ko bhraamak kar detii hai
 The Aryan languages did not have idyllic sounds before the Vedic period, but developed further under the influence of the Dravidian language
 vyakaranik aadhaar sabase adhik pramanik hota he
 Because it does not change quickly due to language discipline
 vyakaran kii samanta ke antargat dhaatu, dhaatu main pratyay lagaakar shabd-nirmaan vyakaranik prakriya dwaara shabdon se padon kii rachana tathaa vaakyon main pad-vinyas ke niyam aadi kii samanta kaa nirdhaaran aavashyak he
 these four grounds, ensuring maximum equality
 is sambandh main spashtrup se samaj lenaa chahie ki yah samya-vaishamy saapekshik he
 While on the one hand, the languages of the European family are different from those of the other family languages and on the other hand, on the other hand, the Indian languages of Sanskrit, Persian, Greek etc
 are also different from each other on the same basis
 vargeekaran karte samay sabase pehle bhugolic sameeptha ke aadhaar par sampurna bhashaayen uresia, prashantmahasaagar, africa or america khandon athwa chakron main vibhakt hoti hai
 Then different families are made by keeping the languages with mutual similarities in a clan or family
 avesta, farsi, sanskrit, greek aadi kii tulana se pataa chalaa ki unki shabdaawalee, dhvanisamooh or rachana-paddati main kaaphi samanta he
 Therefore, an Indian family has been made of such languages of India and Europe
 pariwaron ko virgon main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 Shatam and Cantum are similar classes in the indo-european family
 virgon kaa vibhaajan shaashaon main hua he
 The 'iranian' and 'bharatiya Arya' are the main branches of the Shatam class
 shakhaon ko upashakha main baanta gaya he
 Grierson has divided modern Indian Aryan languages into inner and outer subdivisions
 atah main upashakhaayen bhashaa-samudaayon or samudaay bhashaaon main bantate hai
 In this way language is a unit of family-classification
 is samay bhaaropee parivaar kii bhashaaon kaa adhyayan itnaa ho chukaa he ki yah purna prakriya us par lagu ho jaati he
 There may be slight manipulation of these names, but there is usually no difference in the stages of this process
 unnisvin shatee main hi vidwaanon kaa dhyaan sansar kii bhashaaon ke vargeekaran kii ore aakrisht hua or aaj tak samay-samay par anek vidwaanon ne apane alag-alag vargeekaran prastut kiye hai; kintu abhi tak koi vaigyanik or pramanik vargeekaran prastut nahin ho sakaa he
 There is a big difference among linguists regarding this problem
 yahi kaaran he ki jahaan ek ore federikh mular in pariwaron kii sankhya 100 tak maanate hai vahaan duusari ore rice vishwa kii samast bhashaaon ko keval ek hi parivaar main rakhte hai
 But most scholars consider them to be twelve or thirteen
 duniya bhar main boli jane vaali qareeb saat hazaar bhashaaon ko kam se kam das pariwaron main vibhajit kiya jaataa he jinamein se pramukh pariwaron kaa zikr neeche he : Main article indo-european language family yah samooh bhashaaon kaa sabase bada parivaar he or sabase mahatvapurn bhi he kyonki angrezi,roosi, pracheen farsi, hindi, punjabi, german - ye tamaam bhashaayen isi samooh se sambandh rakhti hai
 It is also called 'indo-european language family'
 vishwa jansankhya ke lagbhag aadhe log bhaaropee bhashaa bolte hai
 Classical languages like Sanskrit, Greek and Latin also belong to this group
 lekin arabi ek bilkul vibhinn parivaar se sambandh rakhti he

 Mr
 Rajendra Singh has named this language family 'nag Bhasha Parivar' in the context of India
 ise 'ekakshar parivaar' bhi kehete hai
 The reason is that its root words are often monosyllabic
 ye bhashaayen kashmir, himachal pradesh, uttaranchal, nepal, sikkim, pashchim bengal, bhutan, arunachal pradesh, assam, nagaland, meghalaya, manipur, tripura or mizoram main boli jaati hai
 Its major languages included Arami, Asseri, Sumeri, Akkadi, and Canaanite, but the best-known languages of the group today are Arabic and Hebrew
 in bhashaaon main mukhyatah teen dhaatu-akshar hote hai or bich main swar ghusaakar inase kriya or sangyaayen banaayi jaati hai 
 The Dravidian family of languages is interesting in the sense that although these languages are spoken in the southern regions of India, they have no connection with the languages spoken in the northern region
 isliye urdu yaa hindi kaa angrezi yaa german bhashaa se to koi rishta nikal saktaa he lekin malayalam bhashaa se nahin
 Some 26 languages of the Dravidian group are spoken in southern India and Sri Lanka but the more famous among them are Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada

 Arabic and Persian had a great influence on Turkey, but nowadays its vocabulary has a lot of its own
 dhwani or shabdaawalee kii drushti se is kul kii ural or altaai bhashaayen ek-duusare se kaaphi bhinn hai

 isai manyata ke anusaar, apni ajna kaa ulanghan karne ke liye in donon ko paapi tehraakar unhen ishwar ne is udyaan se bahaar nikal diya tha

 isai manyata ke anusaar ek sarp ne pehle hawwa ko uksaaya or phir hawwa ne aadam ko gyaan kaa fal khaane ke liye uksaaya
 Adam disobeyed and ate the fruit
 is se uski nishkapatata khatm ho gai or aadam or hawwa ko ek-duusare ko dekhakar shame mahasoos hone lagi
 He tried to cover some of his limbs by making small robes of some fig leaves
 jab ishwar unase milane aaye or yah dekha to vah samaj gaye kii aadam ne gyaan kaa fal kha liya he or bhayankar krodh main aa gaye

 In the present era, many Christian and non-christian writers have criticized these beliefs

 Fermion is one of two categories of basic particles, the other is boson
 fermion kan un kanon ko kaha jaataa he jo fermi diraaq sankhyikee dwaara varnit kiye jate hai or jinaki kwantum sankhya pauli apvarjan niyam dwaara nirdhaarit hoti he
 This includes quarks and leptons and any combined particles made by them consisting of odd numbers, such as baryons and nuclei of different atoms
 fermionon kaa prachakran purnank kaa ardh-gunaj hota he; sabhi gyaat mulkanon kaa prachakran 1⁄2 he
 All known fermions are dirac fermions; Which have different per-particles for all known particles

 So far observed particles have six different types of quarks, three of which are positively charged, while the charge on the other three is negative
 leptone prabal anyonya kriya main bhaag nahin lete
 Their antagonists are per-leptons whose lepton number and charge are opposite
 electron ke pratikan ko aitihaasik kaarnon se pojitron kehete hai
 According to the standard model of particle physics, there are a total of six types of leptons, three of which are charged leptons called electron-like leptons and the other three leptons are chargeless called neutrinos
 boson moolbhoot kanon ke prakaar main ek tarah ke kan hai jo fermionon se bhinn hai
 Bosons are called particles that follow the Bose – Einstein statistic and have integer rotation
 boson mulkan ho sakate hai jaise: photone, gluon aadi athwa sammishra kan jaise meson
 All fundamental forces of nature are governed by gauge bosons and the mass is assumed to be produced by the Higgs field
 maanak model ke anusaar mul boson nimna hai: According to ultra-symmetric theories, there are some other particles also, not one of which was observed till 2014: Note: Just as the photon, z boson and W± bosons are superpositions of the B0, W0, W1, and W2 fields – the photino, zino, and wino± are superpositions of the bino0, wino0, wino1, and wino2 by definition
no matter if one uses the original gauginos or this superpositions as a basis, the only predicted physical particles are neutrlinores or charginous as a superposition of them together with the Higgsinos
 Other theories predict the existence of additional bosons: Mirror particles are predicted by theories that restore parity symmetry
 Magnetic monopole is a generic name for particles with non-zero magnetic charge
 They are predicted by some guts
 Tachyon is a generic name for hypothetical particles that travel faster than the speed of light and have an imaginary rest mass
 Preons were suggested as subparticles of quarks and leptons, but modern collider experiments have all but ruled out their existence
 kaluza–klein towers of particles are predicted by some models of extra dimensions
 The extra-dimensional momentum is manifested as extra mass in four-dimensional spacetime

 In 1940, Duke's Rhine, J
G
 Pratt and others wrote a review of all leaf-guessing experiments conducted internationally since 1882
 The title, extra-sensory Perception After Sixth Years, was recognized as the first meta-analysis in science
 isamen rin ke adhyayan ke anukaran kaa byora bhi shaamil he
 During these years, 50 studies were published, of which 33 studies were published by investigators other than Rhine and the Duke University group; 61% of these studies have suggestive and significant results related to ESP
 inamen se colorado vishvavidhyalay or hunter college, neuyork ke manovaigyanik the jinhone atyadhik namoona sankhya or ucchtam str ke mahatv ke saath adhyayan ko puraa kiya
 Replication failures encouraged Rhine to pursue research in the conditions necessary to produce the effect experimentally
 However he stated that it was not a basic theory of replication or ESP that would develop research, but rather a greater interest in the unconscious mental process and the process of properly understanding the human personality

 Hettinger studied the ability to retrieve related information with token objects
 card-anumaan adhyayanon main anumaan lagane ke prayaason main landan vishvavidhyalay ke ganitagya samual sol sabase kam safal rahe
 However, Sol then re-analyzed for evidence of Kerrington's word displacement following a hypothesis based on his own findings at Carrington's suggestion
 sol uske purv ke chaar saathiyon randolf takar pendlyton IV, amanda beli, ling daao or rashel brown ne visthaapan saboot ko ascharyajanak rup se khoj kii: arthath, jiske liye unhen saunpa gaya tha usase unhen hataa diya gaya or pareekshan ke liye unki pratikriya kaaphi anuroop thi
 Sol sought the confirmation of this finding while testing these participants in new experiments

 His conclusions about Telepathy and Rhine's claims to many other scientists and philosophers were fairly credible, but they were heavily criticized as fraud after Sol's death in 1975, largely abandoning aid on their behalf

 Personality tips have also been tested

 These studies proved to be more reliable evidence than the Rhine's forced-choice example, with over-analysis reliable evidence effects and several confirmed replication studies
 Systematic hypotheses are also currently interpreted to explain the results, while others call for advance theoretical developments in parapsychology on their structures

 Most phenomena of extra-sensory perception are said to occur spontaneously in situations that are not scientifically controlled
 is tarah ke anubhavon ko aksar zyada majboot paaya gaya he or kii prayogshaala prayogon tulana main adhik spasht dekha gaya he
 These reports, rather than laboratory evidence, have historically provided the basis for a broader belief in the authenticity of these events
 haalanki, niyantrit vaigyanik paristhitiyon main aise asaadhaaran anubhavon ko doharaana atyant mushkil siddh hua he 
 Proponents of the ESP phenomenon cite various studies that discuss the evidence for the existence of the phenomenon: the works of J

 Raine, Russell Targ, Harold E
 Puthof, and the experiments of SRI International physicists in the 1970s often cited in the debate ESP is performed
 ESP ko lekar mukhya maujuuda bahes is baat ke ird gird he ki iske liye sankhyikeey rup se kathor prayogshaala sabooton ko jamaa kiya gaya he yaa nahin
 Most of the accepted results are all slight or significant statistical results

 Parapsychologists say that data from several studies suggest that some individuals have consistently given remarkable results, while the results for the rest are of a very significant tendency despite being small and cannot be dismissed
 ek aam dharna he ki ek sammohit vyakti ESP pradarshit karne main sakasham hota he
 Carl Sargent, a psychology scholar at the University of Cambridge, heard the initial claims of the hypnosis-esp relationship and designed an experiment to test its veracity
 unhone college ke 40 saathi chaatr ko bhartee kiya, jinamein se kisi main bhi ESP kii pahchaan nahin kii gai thi or phir unhen ek samooh main vibhajit kiya jise pareekshan se pehle 25 jiner card ke saath sammohit kiya janaa tha or ek gaiyr-sammohit niyantrit samooh jis par samaan card ke saath pareekshan kiya janaa tha
 Controlled students scored an average of 5 out of 25 correct, exactly as they might have inadvertently
 sammohit chaatro ne unki tulana main dugane str se behatar pradarshan kiya or 25 sahi main 11
9 ank kaa ausat paaya
 Sergeant's own interpretation of this experiment is that ESP is associated with a calm and relaxed state of mind, with a more nounless level of consciousness
 rashtriya vigyaan academy ke vaigyanikon main se 96% ne khud ko ESP ke sambandh main "uljhan" main bataaya, 4% ko sai main vishwaas tha, 10% ne mana ki paramanovaigyanik anusandhan ko protsaahit karnaa chahie
 The National Academy of Sciences had previously sponsored the Enhancing Human Performance Report on mental development programs, which was skeptical about parapsychology
 ndehwaadiyon kaa daawa he ki vaigyanik paddati jo yah dikhaati he ki ESP ke bare main mahatvapurn sankhyikeey saboot pesh karti he, use pralekhith nahin kiya gaya he, ki ESP vyavastha ke peeche vyavhaarya siddhant kii kami he or kaha ki aise aitihaasik maamle hai jinamein paramanovaigyanik adhyayan ke prayogtmak dizin main khaamiyon ko paaya gaya he
 Critics of experimental parapsychology believe that there are no consistent and agreed-upon standards by which "ESP" power can be tested
 yah tark diya jaataa he ki jab manovigyaan ko andeh dwaara chunauti di jaati he or ve apni kathith shaktiyon ko sabit karne main asafal ho jate hai to ve apni asafalataa ke kaaran ke rup main har prakaar ke tark dete hai, jaise ki ndehwaadee unke prayog ko apni "nakaaratmak urja" dwaara prabhavit kar rahaa he
