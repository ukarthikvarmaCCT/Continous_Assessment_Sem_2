 raaj kumaar, mrityu- 3 july 1996 mumbai) hindi filmon main ek bhartiya abhinayta the
 His name was Kulbhushan Pandit but in the film world he is famous by his second name 'raj Kumar'
 parmparik parsi theatre kii samvaad adaigi ko inhone apanaaya or yahi unki vishesh pahchaan bani
 Famous films played by him include Paagam, Waqt, Neelkamal, Pakiza, Maryada, Heer Ranjha, Saudagar etc
 hindi cinema jagat main yun to apane damdaar abhinay se kai sitaron ne darshakon ke dil par raaj kiya lekin ek aisa bhi sitara hua, jise sirf darshakon ne hi nahin balki puri film industry ne bhi 'rajkumaar' mana or vah the samvaad adaayagi ke betaj badshaah kulbhushan pandit urf rajkumaar
 Born on 8 October 1926 in Pakistan's Balochistan province, Rajkumar started working as a sub-inspector at Mahim police station in Mumbai after completing his graduation
 ek din raat main gasht ke dauraan ek sipaahi ne rajkumaar se kaha ki hajur aap rang-dhang or kad-lathi main kisi hero se kam nahin he
 If you become a hero in films, then you can rule millions of hearts, and this thing of a soldier was appreciated to the prince
 rajkumaar mumbai ke jis thane me karyrat the
 There was frequent movement of people associated with the film industry
 ek baar police stesan main film nirmaataa baldev dube kuch jaruri kaam ke liye aaye hue the
 He was impressed by Rajkumar's style of talking and offered Rajkumar to act as an actor in his film 'shahi Bazaar'
 rajkumaar sipaahi kii baat sunakar pehle hi abhinayta banane kaa man bana chuke the
 So he immediately resigned from his sub-inspector job and accepted the offer of the producer
 shahi bazaar ko banane main kaaphi samay lag gaya or rajkumaar ko apana jeevanyaapan karnaa bhi mushkil ho gaya
 Therefore, he accepted a small role in the film 'rangeili' released in the year 1952
 yah film cinema gharon main kab lagi or kab chali gayi
 Did not realize it
 is bich unki film 'shahi bazaar' bhi pradarshit hui
 Which fell at the box office
 shahi bazaar kii asafalataa ke baad rajkumaar ke tamaam rishtedaar yah kehane lage ki tumhaara cheharaa film ke liye upyukt nahin he
 And some people started saying that you can become a villain
 varsh 1952 se 1957 tak rajkumaar film industry main apni jagah banane ke liye sangharsh karte rahe
 After 'rangeeli', Rajkumar went on to accept whatever role he got
 is bich unhone 'anmol' 'sahaara', 'avasar', 'ghamand', 'neelmani' or 'krishna sudama' jaisi kai filmon main abhinay kiya lekin inamen se koi bhi film box offis par safal nahin hui
 Raj Kumar appeared in a small role of a farmer in the village of Mother India in the 1957 film Mahabub Khan's Mother India
 haalanki yah film puri tarah abhinetri naragis par kendrit thi phir bhi raaj kumaar apni choti si bhoomika main apane abhinay kii chhap chhodane main kaamyaab rahe
 He also gained international fame for his strong acting in the film and after the success of the film, Raj Kumar became established in the film industry as an actor
 varsh 1959 main pradarshit film 'paigaam' main unke saamne hindi film jagat ke abhinay samraat dilip kumaar the lekin raaj kumaar ne yahan bhi apni shashakt bhoomika ke zariye darshakon kii vaahvahee luutane main safal rahe
 After this, Raj Kumar through success in films like 'dil Apna Aur Preet Parai-1960', 'gharana- 1961', 'godan- 1963', 'dil Ek Mandir- 1964', 'dooj ka Chand- 1964' Adding to his acting among the audience, he reached a situation where he could choose his role in the film himself
 varsh 1965 main pradarshit film kaajal kii jabardast kamyaabi ke baad raaj kumaar bataur abhinayta apni alag pahchaan bana lee
 In the 1965 BR Chopra film Waqt, he was able to attract the attention of the audience once again with his excellent acting
 film vaqt main raaj kumaar kaa bolaa gaya ek samvaad "chinay seth jinke ghar shishe ke bane hote he wo dusron pe pathar nahin phenkaa karte yaa phir chinay seth ye churi bacchon ke khilne kii chiz nahin haath cat jaye to koon nikal aata he" darshakon ke bich kaafii lokapriy hua
 With the success of the film, Raj Kumar reached the bulls of fame
 aisi sthiti jab kisi abhinayta ke saamne aati he to vah manamaani karne lagata he or khyaati chaa jane kii uski pravriti badhati jaati he or jald hi vah kisi khaas image main bhi bandha jaataa he
 But Raj Kumar never tied in any particular image, so even after the success of these films, he did 'hamraaz- 1967', 'neelkamal- 1968', 'mere Huzoor- 1968', 'heer Ranjha- 1970' and 'pakiza- Even in 1971 ', she accepted a romantic role which did not match her film character, yet Raj Kumar was successful in winning the audience's heart here
 varsh 1978 main pradarshit film karmyogi main raaj kumaar ke abhinay or vividhta ke nae aayam darshakon ko dekhne ko mili
 In this film, he made his mark in two different roles
 abhinay main ekarupatha se bachane or swayan ko charitra abhinayta ke rup main bhi sthapit karne ke liye raaj kumaar ne apane ko vibhinn bhoomikaaon main pesh kiya
 In this sequence, he did not hesitate to play the character role in the film Bulandi released in the year 1980 and through this film, he also kept the mind of the audience
 iske baad raaj kumaar ne 'kudarat- 1981', 'dharmakanta- 1982', 'sharaara- 1984', 'rajtilak- 1984', 'ek nayi paheli- 1984', 'marate dam tak- 1987', 'surya- 1989', 'jangbaaj- 1989', 'police public- 1990' jaisi kai superhit filmon ke zariye darshako ke dil par raaj kiya
 In the film 'saudagar' released in 1991, new dimensions of Rajkumar's acting were seen
 subhash ghai kii nirmit is film main rajkumaar 1959 main pradarshit film 'paigaam' ke baad duusari baar dilip kumaar ke saamne the or abhinay kii duniya ke in donon mahaarathiyon kaa takaraav dekhne laayak tha
 In the nineties, Raj Kumar reduced his work to films
 is dauraan raaj kumaar kii 'tirangaa- 1992', 'police or mujrim insaaniyat ke devtaa- 1993', 'betaj badshaah- 1994', 'jawaab- 1995', 'god or gan' jaisi filmein pradarshit hui
 Raj Kumar, who was completely alone, probably felt that death was too close to him, so he called his son Puru Raj Kumar to him and said, "look, death and life are a personal matter of man
" meri maut ke bare main mere mitra chetan anand ke alaava or kisi ko nahin bataanaa
 To inform the film industry only after my last rites
 " Rajkumar, the Sartaj actor of the film world, left us on 3 July 1996
 lekin rajkumaar kii acting styl, unke safed juute or unke dialog aaj tak darshakon ke jehan main jinda hai

 Among the texts which have an important place in the Indian life stream, Puranas are considered very important as devotional texts
 atharah puraanon main alag-alag devi-devataaon ko kendra maanakar paap or punya, dharm or adharm, karm or akarm kii gaathaayen kahi gai hai
 Some Puranas describe the beginning of the universe from beginning to end
 'puraana' kaa shabdic arth he, 'pracheen' yaa 'purana'
 The Puranas are composed mainly in Sanskrit but some Puranas have been composed in regional languages as well
 hindu or jain donon hi dharmon ke vaanmay main puraana milte hai
 There is no limit to the subjects mentioned in the Puranas
 isamen brahmandavidya, devi-devataaon, raajaaon, nayakon, rishi-muniyon kii vanshavali, lokkathaayen, tirthayatra, mandir, chikitsa, khagol shaastra, vyakaran, khanij vigyaan, hasya, premakathaon ke saath-saath dharamshastra or darshan kaa bhi varnan he
 There is a great disparity in the contents of various Puranas
 itnaa hi nahin, ek hi puraana ke kai-kai pandulipiyaan praapt hui hai jo paraspar bhinn-bhinn hai
 The creators of Hindu Puranas are unknown and it seems that many creators have composed them over many centuries
 iske vipareet jain puraana jain puraanon kaa rachanakaal or rachanakaaron ke naam bataae ja sakate hai
 Coming from ritual to knowledge, a continuous stream of devotion has flowed through the Puranas in the Indian psyche
 vikaas kii isi prakriya main bahudevvaad or nirgun brahm kii swaroopatmak vyakhya se dhire-dhire maanas avatharavaad yaa sagun bhakthi kii ore prerit hua
 In the Puranas, there are communal or simple teachings from the Vedic period, ideas related to creation, collection of traditional accounts and stories etc
 of ancient kings and sages, as well as the bizarre and interesting narratives of fables
 puraana us prakaar pramaan granth nahin hai jis prakaar shruti, smriti aadi hai
 In the Puranas many things are found in the form of Vishnu, Vayu, Matsya and historical circles in the Bhagavata - genealogy of kings etc
 ye vanshawaliyaan yadhyapi bahut sankshipt hai or inamen paraspar kahin kahin virodh bhi hai par hai bade kaam kii
 Historians have paid special attention to the Puranas here and they are investigating these genealogies
 'puraana' kaa shabdic arth he - 'pracheen aakhyaan' yaa 'puraani katha'
 The word 'pura' means - non-past and past
 ‘an’ shabd kaa arth hota he -kahana yaa batalaana
 The word Purana in Raghuvansh means "purana Patrapag Magannataram" and in Vedic poetry "ancient: chronicles" is given
 saanskrithik arth se hindu samskruti ke ve vishisht dharmagranth jinamein sristi se lekar pralay tak kaa itihaas-varnan shabdon se kiya gaya ho, puraana kahe jate he
 The mention of the word Purana is also found in the Vedic era including the Vedas, and hence it can be considered the most ancient
 atharvaveda ke anusaar "rich: saamani chhandansi puranan yajusha sah 11
7
2") arthath puraanon kaa aavirbhaav rik, sam, yajus oud chand ke saath hi hua tha
 In the Shatapatha Brahmin, the Puranavagamayya is called the Veda
 chaandogya upanishad ne bhi puraana ko veda kaha he
 In the Brihadaranyakopanishad and Mahabharata it is said that "history Puranabhyam Vedarth Mupabarhayet" means the Veda should be interpreted through the Purana
 inase yah spasht he ki vaidic kaal main puraana tathaa itihaas ko samaan str par rakhaa gaya he
 Five signs of Purana have been considered in the ancient lexicons such as the Amarakosh, etc
: canto, prefix, clan, manvantara, and hereditary
 mana jaataa he ki sristi ke rachanakarta brahmaji ne sarvapratham jis pracheenatam dharmagranth kii rachana kii, use puraana ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Puranas have been guiding deities, sages, humans - all since ancient times
 puraana manushya ko dharm evam niti ke anusaar jivan vyateet karne kii shiksha dete hai
 The Puranas analyze human deeds and prevent them from committing misdeeds
 puraana vastutah vedon kaa vistaar hai
 The Vedas are written in a very complex and dry language style
 vedavyas ji ne puraanon kii rachana or punarrachana kii
 It is said, "poornat Purana" which means, which is the complement of the Vedas, ie Purana
 vedon kii jatil bhashaa main kahi gai baton ko puraanon main saral bhashaa main samajhaayaa gaya hai
 Avatarism has been revered in the Puranas
 nirgun niraakaar kii satta ko maanate hue sagun saakaar kii upasna karnaa in granthon kaa vishay he
 The Puranas have stories of sin-virtue, religion-iniquity and karma-action, keeping different goddesses in the center
 prem, bhakthi, tyaag, seva, sahansheeltaa aise maanviya gun hai, jinke abhaav main unnat samaaj kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati
 In the Puranas, a detailed description is found about the many forms of deities
 puraanon main satya ko pratishthit main dushkarm kaa vistrut chithran puranakaron ne kiya he
 Puranas have given a detailed account of the vicious tendencies of the deities, but the basic objective is the development of goodwill and the reputation of truth
 keval 5 matsay, vaayu, vishnu, brahman evam bhagavat puraanon main hi raajaaon kii vanshabali pai jaati he
 The Puranas are eighteen
 m-2, bha-2, br-3, va-4
 A-1, Na-1, P-1, Lin-1, C-1, Ku-1, Sk-1 According to Vishnu Purana, their names are - Vishnu, Padma, Brahma, Vayu, Bhagavata, Narada, Markandeya, Agni, Brahmavaivarta, Linga, Varaha, Skanda, Vamana, Kurma, Matsya, Garud, Universe and Future
 puraanon main ek vichitrataa yah he ki prayek puraana main atharaho puraanon ke naam or unakishlokasankhya he
 Names and verses are often found, there is a difference somewhere
 jaise kurm puraana main agni ke sthaan main vayupurana; markandeya puraana main lingapurana ke sthaan main nrisinghpurana; devibhagwat main shiv puraana ke sthaan main naarad puraana or matsay main vayupurana he
 Nowadays, two Puranas are found in the name of Bhagwat - one Shrimad Bhagwat, and the other Devi Bhagwat koun vastav main puraana he isapar jhagada rahaa he
 Ramashram Swami has proved in 'durjanmuchchapetika' that Shrimad Bhagwat is the Purana
 isapar kashinath bhatta ne 'durjanmukhmahachapetica' tathaa ek or pandit ne 'durjanmukhpadyapaduka' devibhagwat ke paksh main likhi thi
 According to Sukhsagar: puraanon main sabase purana vishnupurana hi prathit hota he
 There is no communal tussle and rage in it
 puraana ke paancho lakshan bhi usapar thik thik ghatate hai
 It describes the origin and rhythm of creation, manvantaras, Bharatadi Khandas and Suryadi Lokas, branches of Vedas and their divisions by Ved Vyasa, Surya Dynasty, Lunar Dynasty etc
 kali ke raajaaon main magadh ke maury raajaaon tathaa guptavansh ke raajaaon tak kaa ullekh he
 The leelas of Shri Krishna are also described, but not in the form as in the Bhagavata
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki vayupurana hi shivpurana he kyonki aajkal jo shivpurana naamak puraana yaa uppurana he uski shloke sankhya 24,000 nahin he, keval 7,000 hi he
 There are four stages of Vayu Purana, which describe the origin of creation, the kalpas and manvantaras, the stories of Vedic sages, different creatures from the daughters of Daksha Prajapati, the lineage of Suryavanshi and Chandravanshi kings and the kings of Kali are often described according to Vishnupurana
 matsaypurana main manwantaron or rajvanshawaliyon ke atirikt varnshram dharm kaa bade vistaar ke saath varnan he or matsaivatar kii puri katha he
 There is a special way to describe the method of killing the demons, the mother, the mother, the ancestral, the idol and the temple
 shrimadbhagwat kaa prachaar sabase adhik he kyonki usamen bhakthi ke mahatmaya or shrikrishna kii lilaon kaa vistrut varnan he
 Within the nine wings, the unity of Jeevabrahma, the importance of devotion, the creation of Srishtila, the birth of Kapiladeva and the teaching of Sanskrit in accordance with the Vaishnava sentiment towards his mother, Manvantara and Rishivamsavali, Avatar which also has the context of Rishabhdev, Dhruva, Venu, Prithu, Prahlad etc
 There are many topics like Katha, Samudramathan etc
 par sabase bada dasham skandh he jisamen krishna kii lila kaa vistaar se varnan he
 On the basis of this wing, many texts of Sanskrit and language related to Krishnacharitas have been made from Shringar and Bhaktiras
 ekadash skandh main yadavon ke naash or barahawein main kaliyug ke raachaaon ke rajtv kaa varnan he
 Bhagwat's style of writing is different from other Puranas
 isaki bhashaa paandityapurna or sahitya sambandhi chamatkaaron se bhari hui he, isse isaki rachana kuch peeche kii maani jaati he
 Agnipuran is a unique Purana, in addition to dynasties and short stories, theology, politics, rajdharma, prajadharma, ayurveda, grammar, rasa, ornamentation, archeology, etc
 are many subjects
 isamen tantradiksha kaa bhi vistrut prakaran he
 The lineage of the kings of Kali has come up to Vikram, also an avatar affair
 isi prakaar or puraanon main bhi kathaayen hai
 Apart from Vishnupurana and Puranas which are found nowadays, there is doubt about the fact that they were not created from behind if the real Puranas are not found
 kai ek puraana to mat-matantaron or sampradaayon ke raag-dwesh se bhare hai
 Some establish the primacy of a deity, some establish the supremacy of a deity, some establish someone
 brahmavaivart puraana kaa jo parichay matsaypurana main diya gaya he uske anusaar usamen rathntar kalp or varah avatar kii katha honi chahie par jo brahmavaivart aajkal miltaa he usamen yah katha nahin he
 For those devotees who were not satisfied with the Raas of Vrindavan of Krishna, there is a description of the everlasting rasa in Goloka
 aajkal kaa yah brahmavaivart musalamaanon ke aane ke kai sau varsh peeche kaa he kyonki isamen 'julaha' jati kii utpatti kaa bhi ullekh he -- mlechhat kuvindakanyaayaan jola jatirbabhuv ha 
 In the Brahmapuran, there is a lot of description of the pilgrimages and their greatness, Anant Vasudev and Purushottam Mahatmya and many such pilgrimages have been written which cannot be called ancient
 'purushottamprasaad' se avashya jagannatha ji ke vishaal mandir kii ore hi ishaara he jise gangey vansh ke raja chodganga ne banwaaya tha
 The symptoms given in the Matsya Purana are not completely found even in the present-day Padmapuran
 vaishnav sampradayikon ke dwesh kii isamen bahut si baaten hai
 Such as pāडaिलilāक्षणā ,a, māyāvādaंदाīंदाa, tamāशास्त्रāstra, puणनāvārvāणनaत्याāti
 vaisheshik, nyaay, sankhya or charvak 'taamas shaastra' kahe gaye hai or yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki daityon ke vinaash ke liye buddha rupi vishnu ne asat buddha shaastra kaha
 Similarly, Matsya, Koorm, Linga, Shiva, Skanda and Agni Tamas have been called Puranas
 saransh yah ki adhikansh puraanon kaa vartmaan rup hajaar varsh ke bheetar kaa he
 All of the Puranas are communal, there is no doubt about it
 kai puraana bahut kuch apane pracheen rup main milte hai par unamem bhi sampradayikon ne bahut si baaten badha di hai
 Although most of the Puranas found today are full of back-made or projecting subjects, Puranas were prevalent since ancient times
 brihadaaranyak or shatapath brahman main likhaa he ki geeli lakdi se jaise dhuaan alag alag nikalataa he vaise hi mahaan bhoot ke nirishwaas se rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda, atharvangiras, itihaas, puranavidya, upanishad, shloke, sutara, vyaakhyaan or anuvyaakhyaan hue
 It is also written in the Chandogya Upanishad that history is the fifth Veda in the Puranas
 atyant pracheen kaal main vedon ke saath puraana bhi prachlit the jo yajna aadi ke avasaron par kahe jate the
 Many things which are in the signs of Purana are also in the Vedas
 jaise, pehle asat tha or kuch nahin tha yah sarg yaa sristitatv he; devasur sangram, urvashi pururava samvaad itihaas he
 Even in the Adi festival of Mahabharata, the names of some kings and some topics have been mentioned and their accounts have been told in the Purana by the learned Satkavis
 isse kaha ja saktaa he ki mahabharat ke rachanakaal main bhi puraana the
 It is also written in Manusmriti that Vedas, theology, history, Puranas etc
 should be narrated in Pitrukaryas
 ab prashn yah hota he ki puraana hai kiske banaae
 It is written in Reva Mahatmya under Shivpuran that the speakers of the eighteen Puranas are Matyavatisut Vyas
 yahi baat jan saadhaaran main prachlit he
 But in the Matsyapurana it is clearly written that earlier there was only one Purana, there were 18 Puranas from that
 brahmad puraana main likhaa he ki vedavyas ne ek puranasamhita kaa sankalan kiya tha
 The next thing is known from Vishnu Purana
 usamen likhaa he ki vyas kaa ek 'lomaharshan' naam kaa shishy tha jo suti jati kaa tha
 Vyas ji gave his Purana Samhita in his hands
 lomaharshan ke chah shishy the— sumati, agnivarcha, mithrayu, shanshpayan, akrutvran or saavarni
 Among these, Akitavran, Savarni and Shanshapayan created a code based on the Puranasamhita read from Lomhadisha
 vedavyas ne jis prakaar mantron kaa sangrahakar un kaa samhitaon main vibhaag kiya usee prakaar puraana ke naam se chale aate hue vritton kaa sangrah kar puranasamhita kaa sankalan kiya
 With the same code, he made three more letters of the disciples of Sut
 inhen samhitaon ke aadhaar par atharah puraana bane honge
 In all the Puranas, Matsya, Vishnu, Brahmapurana has been said to be the first, but what is the Brahmapurana that is prevalent nowadays, it has been said before
 jo kuch ho, yah to upar likhe pramaan se siddh he ki atharah puraana vedavyas ke banaae nahin hai
 Among the Puranas that are found today, the composition of Vishnupurana and Brahmapurana appears to be ancient
 vishnupurana main 'bhavishya rajvansh' ke antargat guptavansh ke raajaaon tak kaa ullekh he isse vah prakaran isa kii chhathi shatabdi ke pehle kaa nahin ho saktaa
 The Hindus of Bali island, which is next to Java, have got the universe
 in hinduon ke purvaj isa kii paanchavi shatabdi main bharatvarsh main purv ke dwipon main jaakar based the
 There is no 'future Dynasty Case' in the Baliwale Brahmadpuran, in which the name of Janamejaya's great-grandson Adhisimakrishna is found
 yah baat dhyaan dene kii he
 This shows that the future dynasty in the Puranas is linked backwards
 yahan par brahmadpurana kii jo pracheen pratiyaan milti hai dekhnaa chahie ki unamem bhoot or vartmaankalik kriya kaa prayog kahan tak he
 These verses are found in 'bhavishra Dynasty' description- ukt ansh se prakat he ki aadi brahmadpurana adhisimakrishna ke samay main bana
 Similarly, examination of Vishnupuran, Matsyapuran etc
 shows that Adi Vishnupurana was compiled in the time of Parikshit and Adi Matsyapurana was collected in the time of Adhishimakrishna, the great-grandson of Janamejaya
 puraana samhitaon se atharah puraana bahut pracheen kaal main hi ban gaye the, iskaa pataa lagata he
 The evidence of the prophecy in the Apastamb Dharmasutra is cited as follows- yah avashya he ki aajkal puraana apane aadim rup main nahin milte hai
 Many Puranas have been re-created due to lack of original Puranas, many things have been added to them
 praayah sab puraana shaiva, vaishnav sampradaay or saura sampradaayon main se kisi na kisi ke poshak hai, isamen bhi koi andeh nahin
 The worship of Vishnu, Rudra, Surya etc
 started from the Vedic period, then slowly some people started giving priority to one deity, others to others
 is prakaar mahabharat ke peeche hi sampradaayon kaa sutarapaat ho chalaa
 Puranasamhita was formed at the same time
 phir aage chalakar adipurana bane jinka bahut kuch ansh aajkal paae janevaale kuch puraanon ke bheetar he
 The purpose of the Puranas was to collect old chronicles, preach through some ancient and some mythological stories, to keep Dharmabuddhi stable in the masses by narrating Devamahima and Tirthamahima
 isi se vyas ne soot jati ke ek purush ko apni sankalit adipuranasamhita prachaar karne ke liye di
 There are 63 Shalakapurushas in the Jain tradition
 puraanon main inaki kathaayen tathaa dharm kaa varnan aadi he
 Many Puranas have been composed in Prakrit, Sanskrit, Apabhransh and other native languages
 donon sampradaayon kaa puraana-sahitya vipul pariman main uplabdh he
 Important material of Indian history is found in these
 jain dharm main 24 puraana to tirthakaron ke naam par hai; or bhi bahut se hai jinamein tirthakaron ke alokik charitra, sab devataaon se unki shreshthata, jaindharm sambandhi tatwon kaa vistaar se varnan, falstuti, mahatmaya aadi hai
 There are also separate Padmapuran and Harivansh
 mukhya puraana hai:- jinsen kaa 'adipurana' or jinsen kaa 'arishtanemi' puraana, ravishen kaa 'padmapurana' or gunbhadra kaa 'uttarpurana'
 These Puranas are also available in Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages
 bharat kii samskruti, parampara, darshanik vichaar, bhashaa, style aadi kii drushti se ye puraana bahut mahatvapurn hai
