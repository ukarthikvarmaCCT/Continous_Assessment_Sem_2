 In 1758 AD, he prayed for the post of chief teacher of logic and philosophy, but he failed

 main use adhyaapan ke saath-saath sahaayak pustkaalay prabandhak bhi niyukt kiya gaya or ab use das pound vaarshik vetan milane laga
 For four years, Kant also worked in this form, but he continued to study, think and write
 "privet dogent" niyukt hone ke baad se 1770i tak uske paanch prakaran granth prakashit hue– The titles of the above texts suggest that the time between 1755 and 1770 AD was the creation of Kant's ideas

 In the same year, he was appointed to the same teacher of logic and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, for which he had to be disappointed 12 years ago
 pehle se ab vah chintamukt bhi ho gaya tha kyonki use 60 pound vaarshik vetan milane laga tha
 In those days, such salaries were paid only to respectable teachers
 granthon ke prakaashan se bhi koi badi dhanrashi nahin praapt hoti thi
 Kant earned only 30 pounds from his "critique of Pure Reason"

 It is considered the best philosophical treatise in Kant's adult texts

 Even after 1796 AD, he was busy studying, thinking and writing, but these eight years of his life were spent in a very pathetic condition
 uski smriti itani ksheen ho gai thi ki use choti-moti baaten bhi likhakar yaad rakhni padati thim
 He did not have the power to take care of his own house; He did not marry, but during the teaching period of 42 years, he made a good impression on his colleagues and students

 a German poet named Hyne has spoken in praise of Kant's philosophical life that proves him eccentric, but his ideas have influenced the subsequent philosophy so much that Kant's scholar considers him the originator of a new era in philosophy

 In astronomy, constellations refer to a group of stars appearing in the sky
 itihaas main vibhinn sabhyataaon nen akaash main taron ke bich main kalpit rekhaayen khinchakar kuch akritiyaan prathit kii hai jinhen unhone naam de die
 For example, in ancient India there is a planetarium named Mrigashirsha, which in Greek civilization is called Oraian, which means "hunter"
 pracheen bharat main taramandalon ko nakshatra kaha jaataa tha
 In modern-day astronomy, constellations are called groups of the same stars, which are internationally agreed with the International Astronomical Union
 aadhunik yug main kisi taron ke taramandal ke ird-gird ke kshetra ko bhi usee taramandal kaa naam de diya jaataa he
 Thus the entire celestial sphere has been divided into different constellations
 agar yah bataanaa ho ki koi khagoleey vastu ratri main akaash main kahan milegi to yah bataaya jaataa he ki vah kis taramandal main sthit he
 Keep in mind that stars and other objects appearing in a planetarium may appear close to each other when viewed from the earth, but this is not necessarily the case
 jis tarah dur dekhne par do pahaad ek-duusare ke nazadik lag sakate hai lekin sameep jane par pataa chalata he ke unamem bahut faaslaa he or ek pahaad vastav main duusare pahaad se milon peeche he
 "planetarium" was called "nakshatra" in Sanskrit and in various Indian languages this word is used even today
 taramandal ko angrezi main "constlation" or arabi main "majamua-al-nazoom" kehete hai
 The constellation consists of stars and celestial objects, which, when viewed from the surface of the Earth, are permanently visible in the same area in the sky
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he kii ye vastav main ek-duusare ke paas hai yaa inkaa aapas main koi mahatvapurn gurutvkarshan bandhan he
 In contrast, the stars of the trilateral are actually in a cluster and have a gravitational bond between themselves

 He was given the lure of friendship and money, but Jagjivan Ram flatly refused to support the British

 In 1920, Babuji joined the Agrawal School in Aarah to pursue higher education
 Along with increasing age, maturity was also being included in them
 He acquired English proficiency due to his curiosity to understand and learn foreign languages, as well as 'anand Math' composed by Honorable Mr
 Bankim Chandra Chatterjee
 Learned even to read the original book of Bengali
 He was also an expert in English and Bengali as well as Hindi and Sanskrit
 In 1925, when Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya came to visit, he was astonished to see the comprehensive knowledge of young Jagjivan and outstanding performance in all fields and he realized that this teenager can play an important role in future independence and nation building
 | He himself met the young Jagjivan and invited him to come to the Banaras Hindu University
 But Jagjivan Ram had to face discrimination on the basis of caste there
 Jagjivan of revolutionary nature openly opposed it and he also succeeded
 In the internal science examination, he passed with the best marks and in the year 1931, he got the highest marks in Bachelor of Science from the University of Calcutta

 The year was 1936 and Babuji's age was 28 years
 The British were trying unitedly to defeat the Congress in Bihar
 He made a fruitless effort to form a puppet government under the leadership of Mohammad Yunus
 Babuji and 14 other members of the Indian Depressed Classes Association were elected in these elections
 Due to the growing political power and popularity of Babuji, the British spoke to support him in return for a large amount, which Babuji immediately turned down without delaying even a moment
 As soon as this incident was known, Gandhiji's faith in Babuji increased more and he said the following lines for Babuji - 'jagjivan Ram is as true and true as Tape Kanchan
 My heart is supplied with respectful admiration for them ' The game of puppet government was over and Congress formed the government
 Babuji was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Cooperative Industries and Rural Development in this government
 In 1938, on the issue of Andaman prisoners and the use of Indian soldiers by the British government in World War II, Mahatma Gandhi was extremely angry and on one call, all the Congress governments resigned
 After this, Gandhiji started his famous movement 'quit India Movement' from 9 August 1942
 Started on He entrusted Babuji in Bihar and North East India to promote this movement rapidly, which Babuji played in a wonderful manner
 But Babuji was arrested after ten days of campaigning
 After his release in 1943, Babuji pushed for the liberation of India
 Babuji was one of the twelve national leaders invited by Lord Wavell to form the Interim Government on August 1946
 Babuji's plane returning home after taking part in the International Labor Conference held in Geneva in September 1946, was located in Basra, Iraq

 This was his favorite subject from the very beginning because Babuji, who grew up in the soil of Chandwa, was born to a farm laborer, where he has personally faced those peculiar conditions and he was also aware of the condition of mill workers in Calcutta
 As Labor Minister, Babuji took the important decision to implement some important laws, tested by time
 These laws are seen as the greatest hope of the working class and the biggest weapon in today's era
 These laws were as follows - 1
 Industrial Disputes Act, 19472
 Minimum Wages Act, 19483
 Indian Trade Union Act, 19604
 Payment of Bonus Act, 1965  do ati aavashyak kanoon jinke bina aaj kaa vyapaarik jivan ast vyast ho jaataa -5
 emplise state insurance act, 19486
 provident fund act, 1952 Babuji considered the Parliament House to be his second home
 In 1952, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru gave the title of Communications Minister to Babu Jagjivan Ram, elected from Sasaram
 At that time the aviation department was also included in the Ministry of Communications
 Babuji took steps towards nationalization of private airlines
 As a result, Air Force Corporation, Air India and Indian Airlines were established
 Due to strong opposition to this nationalization scheme, Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel also stood in favor of postponing it
 But on Babuji's persuasion, he agreed and the protest was almost over
 He also talked about laying a network of post offices in villages and started the challenging task of expanding the network
 Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, the first President of the year of India, described this hard work of Babuji in this way - 'babu Jagjivan Ram is a determination worker, At the same time, he has not lagged behind anyone in renunciation
 They have the same enthusiasm and passion of the religious leaders

 But Babuji resigned under the Kamaraj Yojana and started strengthening the Congress Party
 In the general elections of 1966-67, the victorious Babu Jagjivan Ram was once again given the Ministry of Labor in that government
 But after one year, he was given the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food
 After the war with China and Pakistan, conditions of poverty and hunger had arisen in India and PL from USA
 Wheat and sorghum found under 480 were the main source of food supply
 In such a difficult situation, Babuji laid the foundation of Green Revolution with the help of Dr
 Norman Borlaug and after only two years India became a food surplus country
 While in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Babuji also brought relief to the country from severe floods and made India self-sufficient in food resources
 Once in the 1970 general electionsthen Babuji won and he got an opportunity to provide his services to the Ministry of Defense like the Ministry of Defense, this time in the Government of Mrs
 Indira Gandhi
 Babuji first changed the political map of India completely
 In that unprecedented war between India and Pakistan, Babuji promised the people of the country that this war would not be fought even on the equal part of the tip of a land of India, and they kept this promise
 For this great service of his, Shri Rajiv Gandhi has expressed his views in this way - 'babuji's contribution in liberating the nation has been very commendable
 His contribution in making the country self-reliant from the point of view of grain and the liberation war of Bangladesh will always be remembered 'in the year 1974 Babuji took the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Irrigation and a new system' Public Distribution System ' babuji ne disambar 1885 main bani bhartiya rashtriya congress ko apni maan ke samaan bataaya he va isaki seva main sadaiv aage rahe | babuji varsh 1937-77 tak bhartiya rashtriya congress ke sadsy rahe | swatantrata prapti uparant ve congress ke liye aprihaary ho gaye the | babu jagjivan ram mahatma gandhiji ke priy to the hi saath hi pandit jawaharlal nehru evam shrimati indira gandhi ji ke sabase ahm salaahkaaron main se bhi ek the | varsh 1966 main mananeey dow rajendra prasad ji ke nidhanoparant congress party kaa aapasi matbhedon va satta kii ladaai ke kaaran bantwaaraa ho gaya | jahaan ek taraf neelam sanjeeva reddy, morarji desai va kumarsami kamraj jaise diggajon ne apni alag party kii rachana kii vahiin shrimati indira gandhi, babu jagjivan ram va fakruddin ali ahamed jaise aadhunik soch ke vyakti congress party ke saath khadey rahe | varsh 1969 main babuji nirvirodh congress party ke adhyaksh ke rup main sweekaare gaye va babuji ne puure desh main congress party ko majboot karne va uski lokapriyata badhaane ke liye purna prayaas kiya jiske parinamswaroop congress party 1971 ke aam chunaavon main aitihaasik va prachand bahumat ke saath satta main laut ai | shrimati indira gandhi ne is aitihaasik ghatana kaa shrey babuji ko dete hue kaha –"babu jagjivan ram bharat ke pramukh nirmaataaon main se ek he | desh ke karodon harijan, adivasee, pichde va alpsankhyak log unhen apana muktidaata maanate hai" a state of emergency was declared on 25 June 1975 by Smt Indira Gandhi
 This emergency brought fundamental rights of the constitution into question
 Mrs
 Indira Gandhi had announced the general election on 18 January 1977, but the country feared emergency
 To deal with this situation, Babuji renounced his post and also resigned from the Congress party
 He created a new party called 'congress for Democracy' on the same day
 Babuji won the 1977 general elections and was given the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense
 Congress for Democracy, 25 March 1977 Was included in the Janata Party
 Babuji was declared as the Deputy Prime Minister of India in January 1979
 In the year 1980, the Janata Party was divided due to mutual differences and Babuji finally formed Congress in March 1980

 hathi duniya kii sabase budhimaan prajatiyon main se ek hai
 An elephant's brain weighing more than 5 kilograms is larger than that of any terrestrial animal
 haalanki sabase bade aakaar kii whale ke sharir kaa vazan ek praroopik hathi kii tulana main 20 guna adhik hota he, whale ke mastishk kaa vazan ek hathi ke mastishk kii tulana main doguna hota he
 The elephant's brain is similar to the human brain by structure and complexity - just as an elephant's vulcanus contains as many neurons as the human brain, which indicates convergent development
 hathi kai prakaar ke vyavhaar pradarshit karte hai, inamen dukh, siikhnaa, maatrutiv, anukaran, kala, khel, hasya, paropkaarita, upkarnon kaa upyog, karunaa or sahyog ityadi bhavanaaen shaamil hai
 These behaviors may also include self awareness, memory, and possibly language
 inamen atyadhik budhimaan prajatiyon ke ve sabhi gun paae jate hai jinhen ketasian or primets ke samatuly mana jaataa he
 Because of elephants' high intelligence and strong family ties, some researchers argue that it is morally wrong for humans to choose them
 arestu ne ek baar kaha tha ki hathi "ve jaanavar hai jo man or buddhi kii drushti se sabhi anya jaanwaron ko peeche chhod dete hai"
 Elephants have a very large and highly volatile neocortex, the same feature found in specific species of humans, apes and dolphins
 vaigyanik ise jatil budhimatta kaa sanket maanate hai
 This is a well-known fact, with at least one exception: Echidna's brain is highly developed, yet is not considered intelligent
 The cerebral cortex of the Asian elephant has the highest volume, one of the most extant terrestrial animals
 Is a cognitive feature
 haathiyon ke cerebral cortex kaa aaytan sangyanatmak prasanskaran ke liye uplabdh hota he jo kisi bhi anya primet prajati kii tulana main adhik hota he or vyapak adhyayan haathiyon ko upkarnon ke upyog or upkarnon ke nirmaan ke liye sangyanatmak kshamta ke shabdon main mahaan vaanron kii shrenee main rakhte hai
 The elephant's brain represents a more complex gyral pattern and has more and numerous folds than humans, primates, or carnivorous animals, but is less complex than the Catechians
 haalanki, hathi ke mastishk kii valkut "ketasian kii tulana main adhik moti hoti he" or mana jaataa he ki isamen utane hi valkutiy neuron or valkutiy synapse hote hai jitne ki manushya main, jo ketasian kii tulana main adhik hote hai
 : 71 The elephant is thought to be equivalent to the dolphin in terms of its ability to solve a problem, and many scientists place the elephant's intelligence on the same level as the Katyasian; In fact, according to a 2011 article published by ABC Science, "elephants are as smart as chimp dolphins"
 hathi main bhi atyadhik badi or atyadhik sanvalni hippocampus, mastishk saranchana limbik pranali main pai jaati he jo kisi bhi manushya, primet yaa ketasian se badi hoti he
 The hippocampus of an elephant makes up about 0
7% of the central structure of the brain, compared to 0
5% in humans and 0
1% in risso dolphin and 0
05% in bottlenose dolphin
 hippocampus bhaawanaaon se sambandhit he, yah vishesh rup se smriti main yogadan detaa he
 It is believed that due to this reason elephants also become victims of mental shock and its symptoms are equivalent to post-traumatic stress disorder

36 kii range main hota he
 The overall EQ average is 1
88, which is an average of 2
14 for Asian elephants and 1
67 for African elephants ": 151
 It is a matter of debate that EQ, or brain size, is relative to body size, as it is intelligently
 There is an accurate scale for, especially the animals with the highest EQ are treasured yet they are not considered highly intelligent or intelligent
 manushyon kii tarah hathi bade hote hote vyavhaar sikhte hai
 When they are born, they do not know how to survive in the world
 haathiyon ke paas jivan main seekhney ke liye bahut adhik samay hota he, yah avadhi lagbhag 10 saal ke aasapaas hoti he
 a comparative method of measuring intelligence is to compare brain size at birth with the size of a fully grown adult's brain
 yah ingit karata he ki ek prajati kam umr main kitna kuch seekhney kii kshamta rakhti he
 Brain weight at birth is around 90 percent of adult brain weight in most mammals
 manushya ke janm ke samay uske mastishk kaa vajan vyask ke mastishk kaa 28 pratishat hota he, bottlenos dolphin main yah 42
5%, chimpanji main 54%, or haathiyon main 35 pratishat hota he
 This indicates that elephants learn the most after humans and this behavior is not just instinct, but this learning process goes on throughout life
 yah dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki vritti sikhi gayi budhimatta se kaaphi alag he
 Parents teach their children how to eat, how to use equipment, they explain their place in a highly complex elephant society
 pramastishk kii temporal paaliyaan, jo smriti ke sangrah kaa kaam karti hai, manushyon kii tulana main kaaphi badi hoti hai
 Spindle cells play an important role in the development of intelligence behavior
 prarambh main, yah sochaa gaya ki spindal neuronon kii upasthiti manushyon or mahaan vaanron ke liye adwitiya thi
 However, studies have shown that spindle neurones are also found in the brains of both Asian and African elephants: 242 as well as humpback whales, fin whales, killer whales, sperm whales, bottlenose dolphins, risso dolphins and beluga whales
 Are also found in hathi ke mastishk or manushya ke mastishk ke bich samanta sansruth vikaas kii thisis kaa samarthan karti he
 : 154 hathi aise jivit prajatiyon ke samaajon main se ek hai jo ek duusare se kaaphi nikatataa se sambandhit hote hai
 Elephant family members are separated from each other only due to death, or they can be separated only by taking their members hostage
 haathiyon main visheshgyata rakhane vaale sinthia mos ne africa haathiyon ke ek parivaar kaa adhyayan kiya
 Two family members were shot by hunters, later chased by the remaining elephants
 haalanki ek hathi kii mrityu ho gayi, doosraa tina naam kii ek hathini, khadi rahi, lekin uske ghutane jawaab de rahe the
 Two members of the family, Trista and Teresia, both of Tina, stand up and help her stand up
 ant main, tina itnaa kamjor pad gayi ki vah jameen par gir gayi or mar gayi
 However, Trista and Teresia did not give up, they kept trying to raise him
 unhone kisi tarah se tina ko baithaaya, lekin uskaa sharir bejaan tha, vah phir se jameen par gir gayi
 Then the other family members also came for help, they tried to put grass in Tina's mouth
 iske baad terresia ne apane daant ko tina ke sir agle hisse ke neeche rakhaa or use uthaane kii koshish kii
 As he did so, his right tooth broke completely, coming out of the lips and nerve cavity
 haathiyon ne use uthaane kii koshish band kar di lekin ve use chhod kar nahin gaye, iske bajaay, unhone use ek chhichley gadde main dafnaanaa shuru kar diya, uske sharir ke upar pattiyaan daaleen
 They stood there all night and started leaving there in the morning
 sabase ant main terresia gayi

 His copy sounds exactly like a human voice
 kosik apni sound ko apane munh main rakhata he, phir ise saans chhodte hue hilaataa he or manushya kii aawaaj nikaalata he
 It does something like this when people put a finger in their mouth and whistle

 bandula ne hook ko tab tak khiskaaya jab tak ye donon bindu ek duusare se dur nahin ho gaye
 When she freed herself she started helping them free other elephants as well
 bandula ke maamle main or nishchit rup se anya bandhak banaaye gaye jaanavar ke maamle main hathi dhokhaa dene kaa prayaas bhi karata he, jaise vah aas paas dekh kar yah sunishchit kar letaa he ki koi use dekh to nahin rahaa

" Coco used to help by hearing this
 haathiyon ke saath 27 saal tak kaam karne ke baad piche kaa yah drudh vishwaas he ki ve shabdon or kuch shabdon kii vaakya rachana ko samaj sakate hai
 This is a very rare symptom in the animal class
 tokyo vishvavidhyalay ke dow naoko iri ne ek adhyayan main paaya ki hathi ankaganit main bhi kaushal kaa pradarshan karte hai
 In the experiment "different numbers of apples were put in two baskets in front of the elephants of the zoo and it was recorded how many times the elephant picked up the basket with more fruits
" When more than one apple was added to the basket, it meant that "the elephant had to keep the total of this count in his mind"
 The results show that "74 percent of the time the animal picked up the perfect basket
 The African elephant scored the highest score of 87 percent
 Humans were able to show only a 67 percent success rate in the same competition
" It was also filmed to prove accuracy

 The study found that Asian elephants also exhibit similar behavior when they stand in front of a mirror of 2
5 m-by-2
5 m - they stand in front of a mirror and eat their food to eat
 Let's get closer
 hathi kii aatm jaagrukta kaa pramaan tab mila jab hathi happy ne baar baar apane sir par paint kiye gaye x ko apni sound se sparsh kiya, is nishaan ko keval darpan main hi dekha ja saktaa tha

 Raj Kumar, Death - 3 July 1996 Mumbai) was an Indian actor in Hindi films
 inkaa naam kulbhushan pandit tha lekin filmi duniya main ye apane duusare naam 'raaj kumaar' ke naam se prasiddh hai
 He adopted the traditional Parsi theater dialogues and this became his special identity
 inke dwaara abhinit prasiddh filmon main paigaam, vaqt, neelkamal, pakiza, maryaada, hir ranjha, saudagar aadi hai
 In the Hindi cinema world, many stars ruled the hearts of the audience due to their strong acting, but there was one such star, who was considered not only by the audience but also by the entire film industry as 'rajkumar' and he was the uncrowned king of dialogue payment Kulbhushan Pandit aka Rajkumar
 pakistan ke baluchistan praant main 8 oktober 1926 ko janme rajkumaar snaatak kii padhai puri karne ke baad mumbai ke mahim thane main sab inspector ke rup main kaam karne lage
 One day while patrolling at night, a soldier told the prince that Hazur, you are no less than a hero in color and stature
 filmon main yadi aap hero ban jaayen to lakhon dilon par raaj kar sakate hai or rajkumaar ko sipaahi kii yah baat janch gayi
 Rajkumar was employed in the police station in Mumbai
 vahaan aksar film udyog se jude logon kaa aana-janaa laga rahata tha
 Once, filmmaker Baldev Dubey came to the police station for some important work
 vah rajkumaar ke baatcheet karne ke andaaj se kaaphi prabhavit hue or unhone rajkumaar se apni film 'shahi bazaar' main abhinayta ke rup main kaam karne kii peshkash kii
 Rajkumar had already made up his mind to become an actor after listening to the soldier
 isliye unhone turant hi apni sab inspector kii naukari se istipha de diya or nirmaataa kii peshkash sweekaar kar lee
 It took a long time for the royal market to be built and the prince also found it difficult to make a living
 isliye unhone varsh 1952 me pradarshit film 'rangili' main ek choti si bhoomika sweekaar kar lee
 When did this film enter the cinema houses and when did it go away
 yah pataa hi nahin chalaa
 Meanwhile, his film 'shahi Bazaar' was also released
 jo box offis par aundhe munh giri
 After the failure of the royal market, all the relatives of Rajkumar started saying that your face is not suitable for the film
 or kuch log kehane lage ki tum khalanaayak ban sakate ho
 From 1952 to 1957, Rajkumar struggled to make a mark in the film industry
 'rangili' ke baad unhen jo bhi bhoomika mili rajkumaar use sweekaar karte chale gaye
 Meanwhile, he starred in many films like 'anmol' 'sahara', 'opportunity', 'ghamand', 'neelamani' and 'krishna Sudama' but none of these films were successful at the box office
 varsh 1957 main pradarshit mehboob khan kii film madar india main raaj kumaar gaanv ke ek kisaan kii choti si bhoomika main dikhaai die
 Though the film was entirely focused on actress Nargis, Raj Kumar managed to leave a mark of her acting in her minor role
 is film main unke damdaar abhinay ke liye unhen antarrashtriya khyaati bhi mili or film kii safalataa ke baad raaj kumaar bataur abhinayta film industry main sthapit ho gaye
 In the film 'paigaam', released in 1959, he had the acting Emperor Dilip Kumar of the Hindi film industry in front of him, but Raj Kumar also managed to rob the applause of the audience through his strong role here
 iske baad raaj kumaar 'dil apana or preet paraai-1960', 'gharaana- 1961', 'godaan- 1963', 'dil ek mandir- 1964', 'dooj kaa chand- 1964' jaisi filmon main mili kamyaabi ke zariye raaj kumaar darshako ke bich apane abhinay kii dhak jamaate hue aisi sthiti main pahunch gayi jahaan vah film main apni bhoomika swayan chun sakate the

 varsh 1965 bi
aar
chopra kii film vaqt main apane laajawab abhinay se vah ek baar phir se apni ore darshak kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne main safal rahe
 At the time of the film, Raj Kumar spoke a dialogue, "chinayi Seth, whose houses are made of glass, do not throw stones at others, or if Cheney Seth does not cut the hand of children playing knives, then the blood comes out" Been quite popular in the middle
 film vaqt kii kamyaabi se raaj kumaar shoharat kii buladiyon par ja pahunche
 In such a situation, when an actor comes in front of him, he starts to be arbitrary and his tendency to lose fame increases and soon he is also tied into a particular image
 lekin raaj kumaar kabhi bhi kisi khaas image main nahin bandhe isaliye apni in filmo kii kamyaabi ke baad bhi unhone 'humaraaz- 1967', 'neelkamal- 1968', 'mere hujur- 1968', 'hir ranjha- 1970' or 'pakiza- 1971' main romani bhoomika bhi sweekaar kii jo unke filmi charitra se mail nahin khaati thi iske baavjood bhi raaj kumaar yahan darshakon kaa dil jeetne main safal rahe
 In the film Karmayogi released in the year 1978, new dimensions of Raj Kumar's acting and diversity were seen by the audience
 is film main unhone do alag-alag bhoomikaaon main apane abhinay kii chhap chodi
 Raj Kumar introduced himself in various roles to avoid uniformity in acting and also to establish himself as a character actor
 is kram main varsh 1980 main pradarshit film bulandi main vah charitra bhoomika nibhaane se bhi nahin hichake or is film ke jariye bhi unhone darshako kaa man mohe rakhaa

 varsh 1991 main pradarshit film 'saudagar' main rajkumaar ke abhinay ke nae aayam dekhne ko mili
 In this film produced by Subhash Ghai, Rajkumar was opposite Dilip Kumar for the second time after the 1959 film 'paigam' and the confrontation between these two masters of the acting world was worth watching
 nabbe ke dashak main raaj kumaar ne filmon me kaam karnaa kaafii kam kar diya
 During this period, films like Raj Kumar's 'tiranga - 1992', 'police and the God of Humanity - 1993', 'betaz Badshah - 1994', 'jawab - 1995', 'god and Gun' were released

 aksar, sampatti kaa maalik majdoor, vetan bhugtankarta ke rup main kaary karata he or puri pariyojna ke liye dizin team banaata he
 However, all building construction projects typically include some elements - such as design, financial, and legal reasons
 Many projects of varying sizes reach an unexpected end, such as infrastructure collapse, cost overruns and / or litigation, but those who are experienced in this field make detailed plans and work to ensure a positive outcome
 During the careful observation

 Many construction projects suffer from preventable financial problems
 kam boli lagane vaale pariyojna puri karne ke liye kam paise kii maang karte hai
 The problem of cash flow arises when workers and materials are not financed by the current amount, and since it is a matter of sufficient funds at a specific time, the cost can increase even when the total cost is sufficient
 
 Fraud is a problem in many areas, but the construction sector is notorious for it

 In accounting and finance, equity is the residual claim or interest of the smallest class of investors who invest in assets, after paying all liabilities
 yadi parisampattiyon kaa mulya deytaon se adhik na ho, to rinatmak equity maujuud hoti he
 In the context of accounting, shareholders' equity represents the remaining interest in a company's assets distributed among individual shareholders of common or preferred stock
 kisi kaarobaar ko shuru karne ke samay maalik log parisampattiyon ke vittaposhan ke liye kaarobaar main kuch nidhiyan karte hai
 This creates the liability of the business in the shape of capital as the business is a separate entity from its owners
 lekhankan ke prayojan kii drushti se kaarobaaron ko deytaon or parisampattiyon kaa yogafal mana ja saktaa he; yahi lekha kaa sameekaran he
 After the liabilities are accounted for, the positive balance is considered the interest of the business owner
 divaaliepan ke maamle main parisamapan prakriya ko samajhane main yah paribhaasha kaaphi sahaayak hoti he
 First, all securities are paid to lenders in exchange for the amount received from the assets
 uske baad, is shesh raashi par aglaa daawa / adhikaar praathamikta ke kram main rindaataaon kii shrinkhalaa kaa hota he
 Proprietary equity is the final or residual claim made in exchange for assets that are paid only after payment has been made to all other lenders
 kuch aise maamlen bhi dekhne ko milte hai jahaan rindaataaon ko bhi apni hundiyon kaa bhugtan karne laayak paryaapt paisa nahin mil paata he, to aise maamle main maalikon kii equity kii pratipurti ke liye kuch nahin bachataa he
 Thus the owners' equity decreases to zero
 swaamitvpurn equity ko jokhim puunji, dey puunji or equity ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Equity investment generally refers to the purchase and holding of shares from stock market stock by individuals and business-establishments in the hope of earning dividends and capital gains when the value of the stock increases
 yah kabhi-kabhi kisi nijee company yaa kisi starop kii equity bhagidaari ke adhigrahan ko bhi sanderbhit karata he
 Investments in minor companies are referred to as venture capital investments, and such investments are generally considered more risky than investments in listed listed business ventures

 Such held amounts allow individual investors to diversify funds or funds and acquire the skills of fund managers in charge of funds or funds

 a calculation can be made to assess whether an equity is worth more or less than a long-term government bond
 ise labdhi antar yaa labdhi anupaat kaha jaataa he
 It is the ratio of the dividend gain of an equity and the dividend gain of a long- term bond

 swaamitvpurn equity main moort evam amoort donon tarah kii vasteen shaamil he 
 Statements listed under Proprietary Equity include: nimnlikhit ghatnaon ke maamle main equity kaa bahi mulya badal jayega: When the owners are shareholders, the interest can be called shareholders' equity; Accounting remains the same and it becomes distributed equity as distributed among shareholders
 yadi sabhi shairdharak keval ek or ek hi varg main hote hai, to ve sabhi drushtikonon se swaamitvpurn equity ko aapas main baraabar-baraabar baant lete hai
 However, shareholders can also do this according to different priority categories based on the use of the classes of shares and options
 isse stock ke moolyankan ke vishleshan ke saath-saath lekhankan kaary bhi bahut pechida ho jaataa he
 Individual investors are not only interested in the total equity change, but also the increase / decrease in the value of their private share of this equity
 equity kaa yah mail-milaap kul share ke saath-saath prati share ke aadhaar par bhi kiya janaa chahie
 In the stock market, the market price of each share is not the same as the equity per share calculated in the accounting statements
 aksar kaaphi zyada lagane vaala stock moolyankan, kaarobaar kii parichaalanaatmak nakadipravaah, laabh or bhavi sambhaavnaaon se sambandhit anya vichaaron par aadhaarit hote hai; kuch karkon ko lekhankan vivaranon se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Thus, there is little or no correlation between equity and the stock valuation of the business as seen in the financial statements
 vyakti, achal sampatti kii equity kii gananaa karne ke liye bazaar moolyankanon kaa bhi istemaal kar sakate hai
 An owner refers to his equity in a property as the difference between the market price of that property and the liability associated with that property

 Sir Edward Burnett Tyler was an English anthropologist
 tiler saanskrithik vikaswad ke pratinidhi hai
 Tiler describes the context of the scientific study of anthropology in ancient culture and anthropology, based on Charles Lyell's theory of evolution
 unka vishwaas tha ki samaaj or dharm ke vikaas ke peeche ek kaaryaatmak aadhaar hota he, inkaa drudh vishwaas tha ki wo aadhaar saarvbhaumik hota he

 Tiler is considered by many to be the founder of social anthropology and his work in this field is considered to be a very important and always appreciated contribution to the subject of anthropology
 maanavvigyaan 19veen shatabdi kii shuruuaat main apana aakaar lene laga tha
 He believed that research done on human history and prehistoric times would help in laying the foundation of reform in British society
 unhonen saadhaaran rup main prayog hone vaale shabd jeevwad se dobaaraa parichay karaayaa
 unhone jeevwad ko dharm ke vikaas kaa pehla charan mana
 EB Tyler was born in 1832 in Camberwell, London
 vah joseph tiler or heriet tiler kii santan the jo aarthik rup se dhani the or quekar samudaay se sambandh rakhte the
 He was the owner of the London Brass Factory
 unka shikshan kaary totenham ke grove house skool main hua, lekin kachi umr main hi mata-pita kii mrityu ho jane or apni roodhiwaadee quekar prishthbhumi ke chalate ve kabhi koi degree hasil nahin kar paae
 apane mata-pita kii mrityu ke baad unhone swayan ko apane parivaar kaa vyapaar sanbhaalane ke liye taiyaar kiya, lekin tapedic ke shuruuaati lakshanon ke kaaran yah yojana bich main hi chhodani padi
 garam sthanon par samay bitaane kii salaah ko maanate hue tiler ne 1855 main england chhod diya or madhya america chale gaye
 This experience proved to be very important and constructive for him and it aroused his interest in studying unknown cultures throughout his life
 apni yatraaon ke dauraan tiler henry christy se bhi mili, jo unheen kii tarah ek quekar or maanavvigyaani or puratatvvid the
 After joining Christie, Tyler had a keen interest in anthropology and helped broaden his investigations to include prehistoric studies
 tiler kaa pehla prakaashan 1856 main unki christy ke saath mexico kii yatra kaa parinaam tha
 When Tyler met the people, he believed in religion and his religious practices and prepared his articles on that basis
 england waapas lautne par unhone ise anahok: yaa mexico or mexican, puranic or aadhunik naam se apni kriti ko prakashit kiya
 Then he did not travel again and studied the beliefs and practices of the backward tribes of contemporary and prehistoric times and then published his work "research on the early history of mankind and the development of civilization" in 1865
 iske baad unki sabase zyada prabhavi kriti maanav samskruti prakashit hui
 Even then, he continued writing and writing until the start of the First World War
 unki sabhi kritiyon main unka sabase mahattavapurn kaary maanav samskruti rahaa
 This was important not only because of its deep study of human civilization and its contribution to emerging fields like science, but it was also important because it had an impact on some young learners, such as J
G
 Fraser
 Fraser wanted to understand this new topic developed by Tiler and he also wanted to contribute significantly towards the scientific study of anthropology in the coming years
 1871 main tiler ko shahi samaaj ke vidwaan ke rup main chunaa gaya or 1875 main inhone oxford vishvavidhyalay se civil kanoon ke doctor kii maanad oopaadhi praapt kii
 In 1883 he was appointed as a keeper at the University Museum in Oxford
 inhone yahaan par vyaakhyaata ke rup main bhi kaary kiya
 In the period 1884-1895, he also got the title of first anthropological reader
 ve pit river mujium ke aanrabhik itihaas main bhi sanlagn the, haalanki isamen inaki bhagidaari kaa hona vivaad kaa vishay he
 He became the first anthropology professor at Oxford in 1896 and was knighted in 1912
 tiler kii vichaardhaara kaa unke sabase prasiddh kaary, aadim samskruti main acha varnan kiya gaya he, jo do khandon main he
 The first section, The Cult of Culture addresses various aspects of ethnography including social development, linguistics and myth
 doosraa khand, jiskaa sheershak aadim samskruti main dharm he, mukhya rup se "jeevwad" kii vyakhya karata he
 The reality of Tyler's ideology is that he is considered 'responsible for religion'
 balki tiler dharm ke prati spasht nakaaratmak bhaavana rakhte he or vishesh rup se isai dharm ke prati
 On the first page of primitive culture, Tyler wrote an all-inclusive definition, one of the most widely recognized for his study of anthropology and religion, that: "culture or civilization, its generality, be taken in the sense of ethnography So it is completely complex in which knowledge, belief, art, morality, law, customs and any other kind of ability which man assumed as a member of society Land
 " Unlike many of his predecessors and contemporaries, Tyler stated that the mind and capabilities of man are the same as opposed to the level of a particular society in social development globally
 iskaa anivaary rup se matlab he ki ek shikari samaaj main bhi utana hi gyaan hoga jitna kii ek unnat audyogic samaaj main
 isamen tiler ne yah antar paaya ki shiksha kaa hi fark hota he, gyaan or paddati praapt karne ke liye hajaaron saal lagate hai
 This is the reason why Tiler understands primitive culture as a child and sees that progress in terms of culture and human brain development are modifiable
 isaki ek vajah jo unhone likhi wo patan ke siddhant kaa khandan karnaa he, yah us samay bahut lokapriy tha
 At the end of the primitive culture, Tiler claimed that
 "the science of culture is essentially a 'science of reformers
" " Another term attributed to Tyler is his theory of "survival"
 Tiler claimed that when a society develops, certain customs that are now unnecessary in the society are allowed to remain as they were before, such as the waste stored in the house
 unke liye uttarajivita kaa siddhant "prakriya, rivaaj or vichaar, hai
 Which leads to a new society only on the insistence of our habit
 yah nayaa samaaj apane puraane ghar se bilkul alag he or is tarah se yah puraane sanskaron ke saboot kii tarah rahata he jinamein se ab naye sanskaron ne janm le liya he
 It also includes some old practices such as European bloodshed
 The long-standing medical practices on which it was based were later replaced with modern techniques
 uttarjivita ko lekar bahut adhik aalochana ke baavjood is shabd ko gadhne main unki moulikta aaj bhi maani jaati he
 The concept of the life of Tiler defines a characteristic of a culture that is a reflection of the first phase of human civilization
 tiler ke anusaar jivan se matlab "prakriyaaon, seemaa shulk, vichaaron or isse bhi kahin zyada he
 These are the conditions of society which are governed by the compulsion of our habit and are changed from their earlier home and it always remains as a proof and example of the condition of our old culture
 yah samskruti ab naye rup main viksit ho rahi he"
 jivan kaa adhyayan karne se maanavjaati ke vivaranakaron ko pehle se sthapit saanskrithik lakshanon kaa dobaaraa se nirmaan karne main madad milti he or sambhavat: samskruti ke vikaas kaary main bhi madad milti he
 Dharmai as Survival
 B
 Tyler argued that in the past, religion was used by people to describe the events of the world
 unhonen yah paaya ki yah bahut aavashyak he ki dharm main sansar main ghatit hone vaali sabhi ghatnaon kaa tark sahit vivaran karne kii kshamta ho
 For example, God gave us the sun so that we would get warmth and light
 tiler ne yah tark diya ki jeevatma hi vastav main dharm he jo har dharm kii aavashyaktaa he, yahi iskaa jawaab de sakati he ki koun sa dharm pehle aayaa or koun sa dharm sabhi dhrarmon kaa aadhaar he
 For them, the soul is the answer to all these questions, that is why it should be the right foundation of all these religions
 jeevatma kaa varnan karte hue kaha jaataa he ki iskaa matlab sabhi praaniyon main aatma hone par vishwaas karnaa he
 Tylor learned the truth that even contemporary modern pious people believe in the soul
 yah satya is baat ko darshata he ki ye log aadim samaaj se zyada pragatisheel nahin the
 For them, this means that contemporary modern pious people do not know the way of the world and they do not even know how life goes because their knowledge depends on their understanding of the world
 
 agar ghatnaon ke hone ke bare main in logon kii samaj se vaigyanik vivaran hataa diya jaye to aaj bhi ye dharmaparayan log ardh viksit hai
 The most important thing is that Tiler considers the piety of modern people as ignorance tied to stereotypes
 duusare shabdon main in logon kaa ishvar main vishwaas jivit rahane ke liye hi he, kyon ki vigyaan ab jin chizon ko paribhaashit karata he wo sab pehle se hi dharm dwaara tarksangat bataai ja chuki hai
