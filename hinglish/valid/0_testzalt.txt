 Couplets of Kabir and Rahim; Meerabai's verses are all free compositions
 hindi ke reetikaal main adhikansh muktak kaavyon kii rachana hui
 The word Muktak means 'complete in itself' or 'other absolute thing'
 Thus, Muktak is a genre of poetry in which the story has no prior connection
 Each stanza in itself is completely independent and gives full meaning

 unke anusaar: In Muktak there is no flow of juice like the management, in which the reader forgets himself in the context of the story and takes a lasting impression in the heart
 There are sprinkles of juice in it, in which the heart-buds blossom for a while
 If the arrangement is a wide forest floor, then Muktak is a chosen bouquet
 This makes it more suitable for societies
 It does not exhibit a full life or any part of it organized by successive scenes, but a delightful segment-scene is brought forth in such a way that the reader or listener becomes enchanted for a few moments
 For this, the poet has to imagine a small stanza of captivating goods and trades and display them in very concise and strong language
 acharya shukla ne anyatra muktak ke liye bhashaa kii samaas shakti or kalpana kii samaahaar shakti ko aavashyak bataaya tha

 vastut: yah paribhaasha trutipurna he

 Its oldest book is the Natyashastra of Bharata Muni
 lekin iske ullekh vedon main bhi milte hai, jisase pataa chalata he ki pragaitihaasik kaal main nrity kii khoj ho chuki thi
 During this period there was independent disturbance in human forests
 dhire-dhire usne samooh main pani ke sroton or shikaar bahul kshetra main tik kar rahanaa aarambh kiya- us samay uski sarvapratham samasya bhojan kii hoti thi- jisaki purti ke baad vah harshollas ke saath uchhal kud kar aag ke chaaron ore nrity kiya karte the
 They used to get frightened by human disasters - for whose solution they must have guessed some invisible divine power and resorted to many measures to appease it - among these measures, man made dance the main means of worship
 itihaas kii drushti main sabase pehle uplabdh sakshya gufaaon main praapt adimanav ke ukere chitron tathaa hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaiyon main praapt murtiya- hai, jinamein ek kaanse kii bani tanwangi kii murti he- jisaki samiksha karne vaale vidwaanon ne yah siddh kiya he ki yah nrity kii bhavabhangima se yukt he

 The Rig Veda is one of the oldest texts in the world and dance material is abundant in it
 rugaved ke nimnlikhit shlokon kii pratiyon main indra kii mahima kaa gaan karte hue unhen praaniyon ko nachaane vaala kaha he
 Indra viz
 tathaa Nahyangam Nrito Tvadnyam Vindami Radhase
 arthath- indra tum bahuton dwaara aahut tathaa sabko nachaane vaale ho
 It is clear from this that the prevalence of choreography was prevalent in the society at that time
 is yug main nrity ke saath nimnlikhit vaadyon kaa prayog hota tha
 Veena Vadam Panighhnam Tunabrahmam Tannrityandaye Talavam
 arthath- nrity ke saath veena vadak or mrudangvadak or vanshivadak ko sangat kerani chaiye or taal bajaane vaale ko baithna chaiye
 Like the Rigveda, dance-related material is available in plenty in the Yarjveda
 yarjuved ke ek mantra se yah pataa chalata he ki vaidic yug main nrity karne vaale ko soot kaha jaataa tha or gane vaale ko shailush kehete the
 a community of these people had been established
 ye log ga-bajaakar or naach kar apana bharan-poshan kiya karte the
 In the society, the work of education of dance and singing was also done by the same yarn and styles
 kyonki is yug main devi-devataaon se lekar stri-purushon tathaa sabhi virgon ke liye nrity kaa mahatvapurn sthaan tha
 The Samaveda was composed to sing the text portions of the Rigveda - hence it is related to the Veda Gana Kriya - hence dance material is not found in it
 natya ke chaturth ang gati ko natya veda ke nirmaataa param pita brahma ne samaveda se hi grahan kiya he

 At the time of the birth of Lord Rama - in the marriage ceremony - coronation - victory festivals etc
 details of dance ceremonies are found
 mahabharat main bhi samay-samay par nrity paaya gaya he
 In this era, the dance-drama-drama trio had developed
 bharat ke natya shaastra ke samay tak bhartiya samaaj main kai prakaar kii kalaon kaa purnroopen vikaas ho chukaa tha
 The interest of the common people had increased so much in the arts that in the then administrations it was sometimes feared that people would leave their work and spend time only in arts and entertainment, so they were sometimes banned
 Was
 bharat muni ne natya kala ko apana lakshya bana kar usee ke vikaas ke liye natya shaastra kii atyant upyogi or purnat- vyavhaarik vivechanaatmak rachana kii- jo ki aaj itane samay baad bhi natya-nrity kala ke liye utana hi upyogi granth he jitna ki tab rahaa hoga- yah saare shastreey nrityon kii ridh he

 yah maha granth na keval natya kala apitu nrity- sangeet- alankaar shaastra- chand shaastra aadi anek vishyon kaa aadim granth he- isaliye ise panchmaved kah kar sammanit kiya gaya he
 Bharat Muni's contribution to the dance world is valuable

 According to this, crooked and sinful people are completely destroyed with death, but this is not the case with virtuous people

 But this theory is not of special importance in the field of philosophy
