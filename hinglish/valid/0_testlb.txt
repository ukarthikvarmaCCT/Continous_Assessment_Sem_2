 Analysts typically carefully study the remaining significant unearned revenue in deferred revenue accounts to get a better indication of their financial performance

 However, only three types of monitors were defined - a monochrome monitor with a resolution of less than 1024 * 768, NC, GND), a color monitor with a resolution of less than 1024 * 768, and a resolution of 1024 * 768, GND, NC)

 This protocol was implemented in only a few display devices

 Pin 12, ID1 of the VGA connector is now used as the data pin of the I2C bus and the previously unused pin 15 has become the I2C clock; Pin 9, formerly used as a mechanical key, supplied +5 v DC up to 50 ma to drive the EEPROM, allowing the host to read the EDID even when the monitor was turned off

 Early DDC implementations used simple 8-bit data offsets when communicating with EDID memory in the monitor, limiting the storage size to 28 bytes = 256 bytes but making it possible to use cheap 2 KB eeproms
 i-didisi main, ek vishesh ai2si adressing yojana ko pesh kiya gaya jisamen kai 256 bit khandon kaa chayan kiya ja saktaa tha
 To do this, an 8 bit segment index is passed through the I2C address 30H to the display

 iske baad chaynit khand se data ko, dohraye gaye ai2si 'START' signal kaa prayog karke niyamit didisi2 adress se turant hi pard liya jaataa he
 However, the VESA specification defines the range of the value of the segment index as 00H to 7FH, so it only allows addressing 128 segments * 256 bytes = 32 KB
 segment index register parivartansheel hota he, jo difolt rup se shunya hota he or prayek NACK or STOP ke baad swatah shunya par set ho jaataa he
 Therefore, it should be set each time accessing the data above the first 256 bytes

 Other important changes include removal of DDC1 and DDC2AB, isolation of isolated VESA P&D and FPDI device addresses, and clarification of DDC power requirements

 Sant Gora was a Hindu saint associated with the Kumbhar Bhakti movement and the Varkari sect of Maharashtra
 gora kumbhaar or anya santon ne abhang ke saikadon geeton ko bhi likhaa or gaaya

 In Hindi speaking this delicious dish is called Pooranpoli because the 7 dishes of Marathi are not pronounced in Hindi, so its nearest sound is used by L

 This Pithi is a stuffing in which nutmeg, cardamom, saffron and nuts are added to make it tasty
 isamen pile rang ke liye chutki bhar haldi bhi daali ja sakati he
 Since it is filled or filled in flour or flour dough, it got the name Puran
 sanskrit kii pur dhaatu se bana he pooran shabd jiskaa arth upar tak bharna, puraa karnaa, aadi hai
 Since the top has to be filled to the fullest, so there are satisfying expressions in fulfillment

 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method

 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Many tambaaku ek prakaar ke nicotiana prajati ke ped ke patton ko sukha kar nasha karne kii vastu banaai jaati he
 Actually tobacco is a sweet poison, a slow poison
 It takes a man's life slowly
 sarkaar ko bhi shaayad yah pataa nahin ki tambaaku se vah rajasav praapt kerani he, yah baat to sahi he kintu yah bhi sahi he ki tambaaku se utpann rogon ke ilaaj par jitna kharch kiya jaataa he, yah rajasav usase kahin kam he
 The biggest thing is that the consumption of tobacco also causes loss of biographical power
 vyakti ko pataa chal jaataa he ki tambaaku kaa seven hanikaarak he kintu baad main lakh chhudaane par bhi yah lat chhootati nahin
 So gradually the biographical power in him also decreases and he even surrenders himself to destruction in a way
 yah sarvavidit he ki puure sansar main tambaaku kaa durupyog cigarette ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It is also used in India in other forms
 jaise bidi, hukka, gul, gudaku, zarda, kimam, kheni, gutkha aadi ke rup main
 Tobacco should be used in any form, it causes side effects on the body
 bharat main istemaal kiye jane vaale tambaaku kai prakaar ke hote he:- When tobacco is used as gul, gudaku, or khaini, it can cause many diseases in the mouth
 safed daag, munh kaa nahin khul paanaa, tathaa cancer rog bhi ho saktaa he
 Beedi-cigarette smoking has widespread effects in the body
 iske kaaran hriday ke dhamniyon main rakt pravaah kam ho saktaa he
 Heart diseases such as myocardial infarction and anemia may occur
 raktchaap bad saktaa he
 Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, asthma, and lung cancer can occur
 iske atirikt iskaa prabhaav sharir ke snayutantr main padataa he
 It has many other disadvantages
 kishoravastha main utsukata vash yaa mitron ke saath in padaartho kaa seven shuru hota he phir iske nasha kaa anand aane lagata he
 Its quantity is increased
 jo log baar-baar log iskaa seven karte he, unka sharir is maadak padaarth kaa aadi ho jaataa he or phir vah usko chhod nahin pate
 Quitting causes many symptoms such as restlessness, nervousness
 is kaaran log iske aadi ho jate he, usee prakaar jaise log sharaab yaa anya padaarthon ke aadi ho jate he or jab koi kisi padaarth kaa aadi ho jaae to uskaa niyamit seven uski baadhyataa ho jaati he
 Cigarette smokers are not only causing physical harm to themselves by cigarettes but also indirectly causing tobacco poisoning in family and children
 yah sab jaanate hue bhi vah inkaa seven band nahi kar pate
 Whenever they stop consuming it, they feel so uneasy that they start consuming them again
 iske liye aavashyakta he ki vyakti khud ko taiyaar kare ki vah ek nishchit din se dhumrapan karnaa band kar degaa
 Announce it to the whole family
 nishchit din ke pehle ghar se cigarette paauch, ashtray, aadi dhumrapan vastuon ko phenk de
 Stop smoking on a certain day
 yadi dhumrapan karne kii ichha ho to apane ko santvawna de
 Drink more and more water
 aisa karke aap dhumrapan karnaa chhod sakate hai
 a lot of it depends on your will power
 kheni, zarda khaanaa yaa gul, gudaku kaa adhik prayog kisi bhi tarah dhumrapan ke upyog se alag nahi he
 If one wants to give up these substances, then he can prepare himself and get rid of the habits of these substances by willpower
 jab koi vyakti chaah kar bhi tambaaku tathaa usase sambandhit maadak padaarth band nahi kar paye or yadi vah is vishay main bahut gambhir he to iske liye si

 Various political, economic, religious, military and social reasons are given for the revolt of 1857

 These laws caused anger in some sides of society, mainly in Bengal
 angrejon ne bal vivaah pratha ko samaapt kiya tathaa kanya bhrun hatya par bhi roak lagaayi
 Cheating was also abolished by the British, but there is still doubt whether the thugs were a religious community or just a community of ordinary dacoits

 a major cause of the 1857 rebellion was the economic exploitation of Indians by the company

 Due to these policies, many farmers, artisans, laborers and artists became poor
 inke saath saath jameendaaron or bade kisaanon kii sthiti bhi badtar ho gayi
 In 1813, the company adopted a policy of one-way free trade, under which British traders were allowed to import completely, Indian goods made with traditional technology could not stand in front of it and the Indian urban handicrafts trade suffered unimaginable damage
 rail seva ke aane ke saath gramin kshetra ke laghu udhyam bhi nasht ho gayi

 The salary of Indian soldiers was just seven rupees per month

 The appalling rumors about the Enfield gun further boosted the soldiers' ambition that the company wanted to change their religion and caste
