 Zuma also deserves condemnation from religious and secular groups when he declares that the ANC will rule South Africa until Jesus returns and it is God's will to continue the anc's rule: ishwar chahta he ki ham is desh par shashan karen kyonki ham ek maatr aisa sanghathan hai jiske banane ke samay padariyon dwaara aashirwad diya gaya tha

 yahi kaaran he ki ham tab tak shashan karenge jab tak yishu waapas nahin aate

 unhone police ke bhrashtachar ke maamle kaa bhi saamana yah kehete hue kiya ki "tum desh kaa bharosa ek aise insaan par nahin daal sakate ho jo swayan ek mujrim he

 lekin, march 2010 tak, nau maheenon apana kaarybhaar sambhaalane ke baad bhi, ve aisa karne main asafal rahe
 This led to increased pressure from opposition parties and ANC alliance partner COSATU to do so
 
 ANC pravaktaa bryan sokutu ne kaha ki zuma kaa "maamla vishesh" he kyonki unke "bade parivaar" ke kaaran unhen sampatti ghoshit karne main mushkil pesh aa rahi hai

 Zuma revealed his interests shortly thereafter

 To be classified in this way, their composition must contain at least 80% cholesterol by weight
 varnak pathariyaan choti, gahare rang kii pathari hoti he jo pittashay main paae jane vaale bilirubin or calcium ke lavenon se bani hoti he
 The amount of cholesterol in them is less than 20 percent
 mishrit pathariyon main adarsh rup se 20 se 80 pratishat cholestrol hota he
 Other common constituents are calcium carbonate, pomitate phosphate, bilirubin, and other bile pigments
 inke calcium ghatak ke kaaran ye praayah radiography dwaara drishy hoti hai
 Gallstones can also remain symptomatic for many years
 pittashay kii aisi pathari ko "silent stone" kehete hai or inke liye upachaar kii aavashyaktaa nahi hoti
 aamtaur par lakshan tab dikhne shuru hote hai, jab pathari ek nishchit aakaar praapt kar leti he 
 pittashay kii pathari kaa ek pramukh lakshan "pathari kaa daura" hota he jisame vyakti ko pet ke upree daahine hisse main atyadhik dard hota he, jiske baad praayah michali or ulti aati he, jo 30 minute se lekar kai ghanton tak nirantar badhati hi jaati he
 a patient may have similar pain between the bones of the shoulder or even below the right shoulder
 yah lakshan "gurde kii pathari ke daure" se milte-julate ho sakate hai
 Often these seizures occur especially after eating fatty foods and almost always occur during the night
 anya lakshanon main, pet kaa phoolnaa, vasayukta bhojan ke pachan main samasya, dakaar aana, gas bananaa or apach ityadi hote hai
 In such cases all the Murphy symptoms are found to be positive in case of physical examination
 pittashay kii pathari kaa khatra paidaa karne vaale lakshanon main adhik vazan hona, 40 ke aasapaas yaa usase adhik umr kaa hona or samay se purv rajonivritti kaa hona aadi hai; yah avasthaa anya naslon kii apeksha safed nasl ke logon main adhik prabal hoti he
 Melatonin deficiency is also a major cause of gallstones, as melatonin inhibits the secretion of cholesterol and also increases the action of cholesterol in the bile and is an antioxidant that lowers the gallbladder's circulating pressure Is able to do shodhakartaaon kaa yah maananaa he ki pittashay kii pathari kai kaarnon ke sangyojan se hoti he, jisame vanshanugat shaareerik gundharm, sharir kaa vazan, pittashay kii gatishiltaa or sambhawatah bhojan bhi shaamil he
 However, the absence of these risk factors also cannot eliminate the possibility of gallstones
 pittashay kii pathari or bhojan ke madhya haalanki koi sidhaa sambandh sabit nahin kiya ja sakaa he; haalanki kam reshayukt, ucch cholestrol yukt bhojan tathaa ucch starch yukt bhojan khaane se bhi pittashay main pathari ke banane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Other nutritional factors that may increase the chances of gall bladder stones include rapid weight loss, constipation, eating less than enough food, not eating more fish and less ingestion of the following nutrients, folate, magnesium, calcium and vitamin C
 Is included
 duusari ore sharaab or samooche ann se bani bread aadi ke seven se pittashay kii pathari hone kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he

 varnak prakaar kii pathari hone kaa jokhim badhaane vaale kaarnon main hemolytic anemiyas, serosis or pittiya maarg sankraman aadi aate hai
 Erythropoietic protoporphyria) has a higher risk of gallstones
 cholestrol pitt pathari tab hoti he, jab pitt main cholestrol kii maatra bahut adhik hoti he or isamen paryaapt pitt lavan nahin hote hai
 Apart from high cholesterol, there are two other reasons which are seen as major causes of gallstones
 pehla kaaran yah he ki pittashay kitni baar or kitne thik se sankuchit hota he; pittashay ke kabhi-kabhi khaali hone or puri tarah se khaali na hone ke kaaran bhi pitt kaa jamaav adhik ho jaataa he joki pitt pathari kaa nirmaan karata he
 The second reason is the presence of protein in the liver and bile, which prevents or increases cholesterol secretion in the gallstones
 iske atirikt, garbhavastha, hormone upachaar yaa mishrit prakaar ke hormonal garbhanirodhak ke prayog ke parinamswaroop estrogen hormone kaa badha hua str pitt main cholestrol ke str ko badha saktaa he or pittashay kii gatishiltaa ko kam bhi kar saktaa he jiske falswaroop pitt pathari ban jaati hai
 Sometimes cholesterol gallstones can also be orally ingested with arasoedoxycholic acid, but it is necessary that patients continue taking the drug for at least 2 years
 However, once discontinuing the drug, there may be stones again
 pathari ke kaaran saamaanya pitt nalika main hone vaale avrodh ko endoscopy retrogred sphinctrotomi ) ke dwaara hataaya bhi ja saktaa he jiske uparaant endoscopy retrogred kolengeopancreyetography ) kii jaati he
 Gallstones can be broken by a process called lithotripsy
 jisame, ultrasonic shock tarangon ko pathari ke ek bindu par ekatrit karke use chote tukdon main tod diya jaataa he
 This makes it easy to get out of the stool
 haalanki, upachaar kii yah paddati tabhi upyukt samajhi jaati he jab pathariyon kii sankhya bahut kam ho

 Additionally, most patients develop chronic diarrhea in about 20 percent
 cholessistectomi ke liye do vikalp hote hai: Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of gallstones in the common bile duct
 iske kaaran pilia ho saktaa he or liver koshika kshatigrast ho sakati he, iske liye cholessistectomi or / yaa iarsipi upachaar kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 On physical examination, it is extremely common for all of Murphy's symptoms to have positive results
 pitt avrodh kii sthiti main twachaa yaa ankhon kaa pilia hona bhi ek mahatvapurn lakshan he
 Jaundice and / or clay-colored stools may result in choledochilithiasis or even gallstone pancreatitis
 yadi upar bataaye gaye lakshanon ke saath bukhaar aata he or jaada lagata he to assending colengitis kii sambhaavna par bhi vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Although stones can usually travel to the duodenum via the normal biliary tract, some stones may be so large in size that they cannot pass through CBD and block it
 isamen ek jokhim purna sambhaavna duodanal divertikulam kii hoti he
 Blockage of the bile duct can lead to jaundice, high levels of alkaline phosphatases, high amounts of combined bilirubin in the blood and high levels of cholesterol in the blood
 isse gambhir pancrietitis or assending colenzitis bhi ho saktaa he
 Choledocholithiasis is a complication caused by cholestolysis, so the first step should be to investigate cholestylitis
 Ideally, patients with cholelithiasis come with complaints of pain in the right upper abdomen and also have nausea and vomiting symptoms, especially after consuming more fatty foods
 pet kaa ultrasound karne ke dwaara, jo pittashay kii pathari kaa ultrasonic chayachitr dikhaata he, chikitsak colelithiosis kii pushti kar saktaa he
 If the liver function blood test shows high bilirubin, it is advisable to have choledocholithiasis
 is jaanch kii pushti ek magnetic resonance colangeopancreyetography ), iarsipi yaa ek intraoparative colangeogram dwaara kii jaati he
 If it is necessary for a patient with gallstones to have a gallbladder removed, the surgeon may decide to do so and perform a cholangiogram during surgery
 yadi colangeogram pitt nalika main pathari ke hone kii pushti karata he to shalya chikitsak pathari ko aavegpurvak aant main bahaane ke dwaara yaa putiy nalika dwaara pathari ko lautne ke dwaara is samasya kaa nidaan kar saktaa he
 Another solution is that the physician may decide to perform ERCP before surgery
 iarsipi kaa laabh yah he ki iskaa upyog sirf jaanch main hi nahin apitu upachaar main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 During ERCP, the physician performing the endoscopy may surgically enlarge the entrance of the bile duct and remove the stone from the entrance itself
 haalanki, iarsipi ek peedaadaayak prakriya he or isaki bhi apni sambhavya jatiltaayen hai
 Therefore, if this doubt is less likely to be true, the physician may decide to confirm the test by MRCP, which is a painless shadow technique, before ERCP or surgery
 iske upachaar ke antargat iarsipi takanic dwaara pathari ko hataaya jaataa he
 The gallbladder is removed, ideally to avoid future normal bile duct blockage, a procedure known as cholecystectomy

 unke jane ke baad hi unki patni rajaswala ho gai
 He sent this news to the king through his bird of prey
 samachar paakar maharaj sudhanva ne ek done main apana veery nikaal kar pakshi ko de diya
 The bird flew into the sky to bring the two to the king's wife
 maarg main us shikari pakshi ko ek duusari shikari pakshi mil gaya
 There was war between the two birds
 yuddh ke dauraan vah dona pakshi ke panje se chhot kar yamuna main ja gira
 In the Yamuna, there lived a nymph made of fish due to the curse of Brahma
 machhlee rupi apsara done main behate huye veery ko nigal gai tathaa uske prabhaav se vah garbhvatee ho gai
 On completion of the pregnancy, a Nishad trapped the fish in his net
 nishad ne jab machhlee ko chira to uske pet se ek balak tathaa ek balika nikali
 Nishad went to Maharaj Sudhanwa with those babies
 maharaj sudhanva ke putr na hone ke kaaran unhone balak ko apane paas rakh liya jiskaa naam matsayraj hua
 The girl remained near Nishad and was named Matsyagandha because the smell of fish emitted from her organs
 us kanya ko satyavati ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 When she grew up, she started doing boat work
 Once Parashar Muni had to sit on her boat and cross the Yamuna

 "satyavati said," Muniver! You are a theologian and i am a Nishad girl

 According to Hindu scriptures, Maharishi Vyasa was a trikala
 tathaa unhone divya drushti se dekh kar jaan liya ki kaliyug main dharm ksheen ho jaayegaa
 Due to the degeneration of religion, humans will become atheists, dutyless and young
 ek vishaal veda kaa sangopang adhyayan unke samarth se baahar ho jaayegaa
 That is why Maharishi Vyas divided the Vedas into four parts so that even those with less intelligence and less memory could study the Vedas
 vyas ji ne unka naam rakhaa - rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda
 Vyas ji became famous as Ved Vyas because of the division of Vedas
 rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda ko kramshah apane shishy pel, jaimin, vaishampayan or sumantumuni ko padhaayaa
 Veda Vyasa composed the Puranas in the form of the fifth Veda in which the knowledge of Veda is told in the form of interesting stories, because the knowledge contained in Veda is very esoteric and dry
 puraanon ko unhone apane shishy rome harshan ko padhaayaa
 Vyas ji's disciples made many branches and sub-branches of those Vedas according to their own wisdom
