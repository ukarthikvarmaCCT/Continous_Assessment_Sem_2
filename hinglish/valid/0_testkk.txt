 Indian languages hindu dharm bharat kaa sabase bada or mul dharmik samooh he or bharat kii 79
8% jansankhya is dharm kii anuyai he
 Vedic culture originated in India from 2000 to 1500 BC
 jiske falswaroop hindu dharm ko, vaidic dharm kaa krmanuai mana jaataa he, jiskaa bhartiya itihaas par gahan prabhaav rahaa he
 The name India itself derives from the Greek Ἰνδία, which itself is derived from the ancient Persian word Hindu, which originated from Sanskrit to Indus, which was used for the Indus river flowing in the region
 bharat kaa ek anya prachlit naam hindustan he, arthath "hinduon kii bhoomi"
 Hinduism has evolved systematically since about 5000 years and can be seen as seven stages that binoculars are in each other
 kuch hindutv ke adhivaktaaon kaa maananaa hoga ki 12,000 saal pehle himyug ke ant tak hindu dharm ko apane sampurna rup main rishiyon ke liye prakat kiya gaya tha
 In the history of Hindutva, mythology is just history from time to time, historians cannot or cannot count
 haal ke dinon main, hindu dharm ko "khulaa strot dharm" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, anokhaa he ki isamen koi paribhaashit sansthaapak yaa siddhant nahin he, or aitihaasik or bhugolic vaastaviktaaon ke jawaab main iske vichaar lagaataar viksit hote hai
 It is best described as a river with many tributaries and branches, one of the Hindutva branches, and is currently very powerful, with many considering themselves as a river
 lagbhag 5000 saal pehle, kaansya yug main, jise ab hadappa sabhyataa kaha jaataa he, jo eent shaharon kii visheshta he, jo lagbhag ek hajaar varshon se sindhu nadi ghati ke vishaal kshetra main ganga ke upar tak pahunche
 Flat
 in shaharon main, ham un chitron ke saath mitti kii javaanon ko khojate hai jo vartmaan hindu prakruti kii bahut adhik hissaa hai jaise pipel vriksh, bail, swastika, saat daasi, or ek aadmi jo yoga mudra main baitha he
 We do not know much about this stage because language remains to be understood
 3,500 saal pehle, louh yug main, vaidic bhajanon or anushthanon se pataa chalaa ja saktaa he jisamen hadappa ke vichaaron ke nishaan hote hai, lekin ek sthai shahari jivan style kii bajaay ek khanaabadosh or gramin jivan style ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 Some Hindutva advocates completely disagree and insist that the two stages are actually one
 is charan main, hamen ek vishvadrushti milti he jo bhautik duniya kaa jashn manaati he, jahaan ishwaron ko anushthanon ke saath pesh kiya jaataa he, or swasthya or dhan, samruddhi or shanti pradaan karne ko kaha jaataa he
 This aspect of inviting the gods and receiving favor from them continues to this day, although these rituals vary
 vedon ne sindhu se apper ganga or nichle ganga maidaanon main ek kramik failaav prakat kiya he
 Some Hindutva scholars refute such geographical spread and insist on the subcontinent to have advanced, such as fully developed, homogenous, urban Vedic culture, plastic surgery and even airplanes since ancient times
 tisare charan main 2,500 saal pehle upanishad ke rup main janaa jaataa granthon ke saath, jahaan anushthanon kii tulana main aatmanirikshan or dhyaan par adhik mahatv diya gaya tha, or ham punarjanm, mathvaad, janm or mrityu ke chakra se mukti jaise vichaaron par adhik dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 This phase saw the rise of shamanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism, its followers spoke in Pali and Prakrit and also rejected the Vedic form and the Vedic language, Sanskrit
 isamen brahman pujaariyon ne bhi dharm-shastron kii rachana ke madhyam se vaidic vichaaron ko punargathit kiya, kitaaben jo ki shaadi ke madhyam se saamaajik jivan ko viniyamit karne or paarit hone ke anushthan par dhyaan kendrit karti hai, or logon ke dayitvon ko unke purvajon, unki jati or vishwa par nirbhar karata he
 vast
 kai shikshavid vaidic vichaaron ke is sanghathan kaa varnan karne ke liye brahmanwad kaa prayog karte hai or ise ek mul rup se pitrusattatmak or magasivadi bal ke rup main dekhte hai jo samtawadi or shantivaadee mathon ke adeshon ke saath hinsak rup se pratispardhaa karte hai
 Buddhism and Jainism, along with Vedic practices and beliefs, spread from North India to South India, and eventually from the subcontinent to Central Asia and to Southeast Asia
 dakshin main, tamil sangam samskruti kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha, us jaankaree ke bare main jo praarambhik kavitaaon ke sangrah se aate hai, jo vaidic anushthanon ke kuch gyaan or buddha dharm or jain dharm ke gyaan ke saath baad main mahakavyon kaa pataa chalata he
 Some Hindutva scholars say that there was no separate Tamil Sangam culture
 yah puri tarah se viksit, samroop, shahari vaidic samskruti kaa hissaa tha, jahaan sabhi ne sanskrit ko bolaa tha
 The fourth phase saw the rise of writings such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Purana, which began 2,000 years ago, where stories are used to reconcile the worldview of domestic and world relations and create the now familiar Hindu worldview
 hamen ek puri tarah se viksit puranic kathaon ke liye pesh kiya jaataa he jahaan vishwa kii koi shuruyaat nahin he yaa ant, kai akaash or kai hello ke saath, kriya or pratikriya dwaara niyantrit, jahaan sabhi samaaj janm or mrityu ke chakron ke madhyam se jate hai, bas sabhi jivit praaniyon kii tarah is charan main mandiron or mandir anushthanon kaa udai hua
 We also see the rise of the monastic Vedantic orders that corrupt the body and everything sensory, as well as the Jap tantric orders, corrupting the body and exploring the body and all things
 ham puraane nigama parampara ke mingling bhi dekh sakate hai, jahaan divyata ko nae agma parampara ke saath niraakaar mana jaataa he, jahaan paramatma shiv or uske putron, vishnu or unke avatar, or devi or uske kai roopon kaa rup lete hai
 With the emergence of new orders and traditions, we also see consolidation of the caste system, which is not a community group based on occupations, which distinguishes itself from not being interim
 kai shikshavidon ne jati ko hindu dharm kii ek aavashyak visheshta ke rup main dekha he jo ucch jatiyon ke paksh main he, jis par aarope he ki hindutv asweekaar karte hai
 Many Hindutva scholars maintain that caste has a scientific and rational basis, and has nothing to do with politics or economics
 paanchvaan charan 1,000 varsh purana he, or yah ek siddhant ke rup main bhakthi kaa udai dekha, jahaan bhakt bhavuk geeton ke madhyam se devataaon se jude hue hai, jo kshetreey bhashaaon main bana he, aksar mandir pranali ko darkinar karte hai
 This was a time when a rigid caste hierarchy firmly asserted itself, based on the principle of holiness and some castes being viewed as inauspicious and inept

 As the war progressed Gandhiji intensified his demand for independence by giving the British the Quit India Movement
 yah gandhi tathaa congress party kaa sarvaadhik spasht vidroh tha jo bhartiya seemaa se angrejon ko khadedane par lakshith tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru's party, sitting second to Gandhiji, was criticized by some members of the party and by some other political Indian parties who believed in both the British and the opposition
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki apane jivan kaal main athwa maut ke sangharsh main angrejon kaa virodh karnaa ek nashwar kaary he jabaki kuch maanate the ki gandhi ji paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Quit India became the most powerful movement of this struggle which led to widespread violence and arrest

 At the end of the war, the British gave a clear indication that the Santha would be transferred and handed over to the Indians
 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition
 haalanki kuch samay se gandhi ji ke saath congress dwaara matbhedon vaali ghatana main se yah bhi ek ghatana bani chunki nehru or patel jaanate the ki yadi congress is yojana kaa anumodan nahin karti he tab sarkaar kaa niyantran muslim lig ke paas chalaa jayega

 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country
 iske atirikt mohammad ali jinna, muslim lig ke netaa ne, pashchim punjab, sindh, uttar pashchim seemaant praant or purvi bengal main vyapak sahyog kaa parichay diya
 In order to stop the widespread hindu-muslim fighting, Congress leaders gave their approval to this plan of partition

 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war
 jivan bhar gandhi ja kaa saath dene vaale sahyogiyon ke saath bhavuk bahes ke baad gandhi ji ne baat kaa maanane se inkaar kar diya or sarkaar ko apni niti par adig rahanaa padaa tathaa pakistan ko bhugtan kar diya

 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits
 iske alaava kai bhartiya jo aay kam hone kii vajah se sangharsh kar rahe the, us samay jo shaakaahaari ke rup main dikhaai de rahe the vah aadhyatmik parampara hi nahin vyaavhaarikta ke kaaran bhi tha

 This decision was completely influenced by the philosophy of Brahmacharya
 Spiritual and practical purity is largely associated with celibacy and disinterestedness
 Gandhi saw celibacy as the primary basis for getting closer to God and identifying himself in his autobiography
 The childhood bride tells her libido and Ishrya's struggles with Kasturba
 She realized that this person They have a duty to remain celibate so that they can learn the love of lust instead

 Gandhi used to wear silence one day a week
 He believed that by refraining from speaking, he gets inner peace
 This influence of Hindu silence theory on him, and he used to contact others by writing on paper on those days, for three and a half years from the age of 37, Gandhiji refused to read newspapers, in response to which he said The steady state of the world today has confused him more than his own inner turmoil

 After returning from South Africa, where he had completed advocacy and was associated with wealth and success, he renounced western-style clothes
 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
 Encouraged to work
 Although Indian workers were often lazy due to unemployment, they often bought their clothes from industrial manufacturers intended to serve British interests
 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India
 Consequently, the charkha was later included in the Indian national flag

 On January 25 too, he inspired people to abandon untouchability as a great sin in the context of this incident, and on January 26, at a reception organized by traders in Madura, he said that i am believing that this misfortune on us is due to untouchability

 If you believe in this thing like me, then you will be quick to take decisions and believe that the practice of untouchability like we practice today is not in the Hindu scriptures
 aap mere is vichaar se sahamat honge ki kisi bhi manushya ko asprishy maananaa ek bhayankar paap he
 Man's ego tells him that he is superior to other people

 In front of the king, Bhuvan lodged his protest against harsh rent
 captain rassal ko yah pasand nahi aayaa or usne bhuvan ko cricket khilne kii chunauti di
 Forgive the year's revenue if you win, lose three times the rent !!! The villagers wanted to face this challenge, but Captain Russell only gave this decision in the hands of Bhuvan
 chunauti ko or badhaate, teen saal kaa lagaan maaf karne kaa bhi laalach de diya
 Bhuvan accepted the invitation to fight on the ground
 ab sara champaner maano bhuvan ko suuli par chadhaana chahta tha
 Everyone's life was going to be destroyed now
 magar bhuvan ke liye to jab tak saans tab tak aas
 The drought was going on for many years
 aakhir ek saal kaa lagaan bhi to kahaan se bharte? or phir captain rasal bhi to chunauti se nahin hatane vaale the
 Receiving Bhuvan, he made a wooden bat and ball
 kuch gine-chune logon kaa dal chhodkar, sara gaanv bhuvan ke khel par hans rahaa tha
 This team started to go to the camp secretly after learning of cricket
 vahaan captain rasal kii bahan olizabath ne unako jhaadeeyon main chhipe dekh liya
 He did not like his brother's dealings with the villagers
 vah gaanv ke khilaadiyon ko gaanv ke najadik maidan par cricket sikhaane lagi
 a servant would also bring with him from the cantonment for Hindi translation
 dhire-dhire, sahaj-sahaj, bhuvan kaa ye dal apane apurv dhang se cricket kaa khel seekhney lagi
 They used to cut wood to strengthen their hands
 filding seekhney murgiyon kaa peechha kar unhe pakadtey
 The bullet began to bowl, twisting its hands like a windmill
 ab gaanv ke logon main bhi utsaah dikhne laga or akhir das khiladi to ban gayi
 One day while playing, the ball fell near the trash
 kachra gaanv kaa achhut safaai sevak tha
 When returning, he swung the ball like this and stunned Bhanki
 gaanv kii team ko gyarahavaan chayan mil gaya
 But how would the village adopt an untouchable? They do not even touch it
 gaanv or sadiyon se chali is parampara kii bhuvan ne aalochana kii
 The residents of the village agreed with Bhuvan's heartfelt words
 akhir muqaabale kaa din jaagaa
 People came from all over the province to watch the game
 captain rasal ke varisht afsar bhi maujuud the
 The game was decided for three days
 gaanvvasion ne pehle gend fankna shuru kiya
 He had a good beginning
 jald hi ek ranaute se vikat giri
 Another blonde player was out after being stunned by the unique ball of the shot
 magar british khilaadi bhi kam na the
 Slowly he continued to handle the innings

 Lakha also lost many catches
 pehle din ke ant main gori toli haaavee thi
 That night, Elizabethan saw Lakha meeting Captain Rasel in the camp
 ab pataa chalaa kii lakh gaanvvaalon se gaddari kar rahaa tha
 Alizabath used to train the villagers with Cricet, he told this to Captain Rasel
 yah bhi bataaya kii kach bhi jaanboojh kar gawaae
 When the villagers came to know, they wanted to remove the skin of Lakha
 unse bhaag nikle lakh ne gaanv ke mandir main panaah lee
 Lakha confessed that he was deceived by jealousy of Bhuvan
 vah bhi bhuwan kii tarah gauri ko chahta tha magar gauri bhuvan ko pasand karti thi
 One chance and Lakha were given
 agle din lakh ne zabardast kach kiye
 Garbage also started running its magic again
 us ne ek saath teen gendon main teen vikaten lee
 The Whites' innings ended at about three runs

 Deva, a former soldier of the British army, was dismissed from the commission
 phir british khilaadion ne gaanv ke ballebzon kii ninda kar unako akulaayaa or ve jald out hone lage
 The second day ended and the half-runs were yet to be scored
 udhar aadhi team out ho chuki thi
 But Bhuvan was still alive in the game
 tisare din gaanv ke baid ishwar kaaka ne or ismail ne bhuvan kaa saath diya
 Ismail was hurt the previous day
 bahut javaabdari se dono ne ballebaazi kii
 Both were run-out
 ab kachra ne ballebaazi sanbhali
 Bhuvan tried very hard to handle more batting
 akhrari gend par kachra ko chha rano kii zarurat thi
 But he was able to take only one run
 kya gaanvvaale haare? ampaire ne no-ball kaa ishaara kiya
 Now Bhuvan faced another ball
 bhuwan ne chakka maaraa or gaanv muqaabala jeet gaya
 And it also started raining
 captain rassal ko unke varishton ne madhya afarika bhej diya
 Alizabeth Bath returned
 rote rote bhuvan or gaanv ke logon se usne bidaai lee
 At the end of the film, a voice-over tells that Captain Russell's changed Africa and that Elizabethan whole life was considered as Radha of Bhuvan

 The difference between Leonardo and other European Renaissance artists is that Vinci did not spend time primarily copying artifacts of ancient times
 ve swabhaavat: prakruti ke anany adhyeta the
 In his paintings of life, along with the subtle reality of expressive representations, such a combination of live motion and flow of lines is found as is not found in any earlier painter

 It was in this year that a change in his life started and he started to be called as Nabi
 isi varsh se arabon ke jivan ke prayek bhaag main prabhaavshaalee kranti ai or jaahili sabhyataa islamic samskruti main parivartit ho gai
 In ancient times, three centuries before Christ, three types of civilizations have names in history: babuli sabhyataa, dajala or faraat kii ghati kii, Civilization of the Nile Valley, Ancient Egypt, and sindh ghati kii sabhyataa jisko bharat ke pracheen nivasee dravidon ne unnati ke shikhar par pahunchaaya tha
 Since southern Arabia was located in the center of two ancient civilizations, Babylon and Egypt, and its coastal plots were fertile, the inhabitants had their own civilization, which cannot be equated with ancient Babylon or Egyptian civilization, yet its own importance
 is
 uparyukt sabhyataaon se vah na keval prabhavit thi, apitu ghanishtha sambandh bhi rakhti thi
 Residents there were skilled in running ships due to settling in coastal plots
 at: vyapaaree apni saamagree tathaa saanskrithik sampatti jal thal ke maarg dwaara sthanantarit karte the
 It is possible, that is why these ancient Arabs have called it the Arabian Sea
 at: is sabhyataa ko yadi samudri sabhyataa kaha jaae to anuchit na hoga
 Sabai was the first Arab in Southern Arabia to enter the field of civilization
 inkaa desh yaman tha or inkaa vyavsaay jalayaan chalaanaa tathaa vyapaar karnaa tha
 They mainly traded indigenous items, spices and fragrant goods
 iske atirikt faras kii khadi ke mani, bharat kii talavaarein, kapade, china kaa resham, hathidanth, simurg ke par, swarna tathaa anya bahumoolya evam adbhut vastuen ve purab se pashchim kii mandiyon main vyapaar ke hetu le jate the
 At this time this caste was a pioneer in maritime trade

 The rule of enthronement was inherited
 is rajya kaa utthan bahut kuch vyapaar ke kaaran hi hua
 After the Minai kingdom, the Sabai kingdom was established, which dates back to 650 BC
 From 115 BC Stayed up sabaai rajya puure dakshini arab main failaa hua tha
 His first period was 650 BC Expires in
 is kaal main raja dharmik netaa bhi hota tha or uski oopaadhi "mukarimb sabaa" thi

 Amongst these greats, the kingdom of Gumdaan was very famous, which was the first skyscraper in world history
 uski chat aise pathar se banaai gai thi ki andar se baahar kaa akaash dikhta tha
 The rule of the Sabai and Himyari states was very amazing, in which ethnic, class and imperial rule is shared by all
 himyari rajya ke isi pratham yug main arabon kaa patan ho gaya
 The main reason for this was the emergence of the power of the rooms
 jaise-jaise rumiyon ke jalayaan arab sagar tath kuljum sagar main aane lage tathaa rumo vyapaaree yaman ke vyapaar par adhikaar karne lage vaise-vaise dakshini arab kii aarthik dasha jeern hoti gai
 The economic plight led to the emergence of political collapse

 The advancement of these two states is the sixth century
 isi prakaar kaa ek rajya madhya arab main kinda ke naam se prasiddh tha jo yaman ke tubba vansh ke raajaaon ke adheen tha

 From the historical point of view, Umvikal was not far from Jahilikal, yet the seed of knowledge was planted in that period

 sah satya he ki arabon ke paas apni samskruti nahin thi, parantu unhone vijit jatiyon ko apana dharm tathaa apni bhashaa sikhaai or unako aise avasar die ki ve apana krititv dikhalaa saken
 The greatest work of the Arabs is that they exploited the cultural possibilities of the conquered castes and by spreading their religion and their language, they also included them in the meaning of the word Arab and the difference between the conqueror and the conquered ended

 Therefore, it took centuries for the Greeks to learn the scriptures, sciences, and the Arabs learned them over the years and not only learned, they also made modifications of importance
 isi kaaran madhyakaalin itihaas main arab vaigyanik saahitiyik drushti se unnati ke shikhar par pahunch chuke the
 It is true that the source of this civilization was the ancient Egyptian, Babuli, Finnish, and Jewish civilizations, and from which these currents flowed into Greece and in this period were again flowing in the form of Greek knowledge and civilization coming to the eastern countries

 jis prakaar arabi sahitya par bahya prabhaav padaa usee prakaar vaastu, sangeet tathaa chitrakala par bhi padaa
 Therefore, the association of the conquered castes led to the foundation of architecture, and Shanai: Shanai: This art produced many styles, such as the sami-egyptian, which followed the Greek, Rumi, and contemporary art, iraqi-irani whose foundation was Sasani, Kildani and Asuri
 The style was dominated by Undulusi North Africa, which was influenced by the then Christian and Vizigothic and was called Morish, Hindi, which had a deep Indian style Effect
