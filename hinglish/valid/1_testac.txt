 haathon ko khubasurat dikhaane ke liye nail-polish lagaana ek aam baat he
 Nail-polishes available in many colors are used to make hands look beautiful
 par kai baar aisa hota he ki nail-polish lagane ke baad jaise hi aap pani se judaa koi kaam karti hai to nail-polish chhot jaati he
 Even then, it does not go away together and it looks very ugly
 aise main agar aap chaahati hai ki aapaki nail-polish zyada dinon tak tiki rahe to aap in upayon ko aajamaa sakati hai
 1
 nakhun saaf karke hi nayaa nail-polish lagaaein
 Applying the new color on top of the old nail-polish creates a thick layer
 jo zyada din tak nahin tikti he
 2
 nail-polish lagane se pehle shishi ko acchhee tarah se hilaa len
 By doing this, it will become smooth and will spread freely on the nail
 3
 Apply the base color before applying colored nail-polish
 base color transperent hota he
 By applying nail polish after applying it, it lasts for a long time
 4
 Apply nail polish in 2-3 coats
 aisa karne se nail-polish zyada din tak nakhunon par bani rahati he
 But apply second and third coat only when the first one dries

 zamin chhin gai, aatanki bache nahin, jaan afat main he or ab upar se bagdadi ke khilaaf ched diya gaya he oparation okara
 That is, the expectations that were left and now they were also shattered
 par aakhir kya he ye oparation okara? or is oparesh okara kaa bagdadi se kya lenaa-dena? to jaaniye, jab aasmaan se qayamat barase, samandar se tabaahi aae or zamin se maut
 So it is just called 'operation Okra'
 in aasamaani aafaton ne jo qayaamat bagdadi ke sir par barasaai uske baad to yakeenan bagdadi soch hi rahaa hoga ki ab wo kare to kare kya
 Fighter jets ravaged Baghdadi's hideouts, one after another, with their terrorists dying
 iraqi or syrian fujen uski zaminein chhinti ja rahi hai or jin hathiyaaron kaa sahaara tha, unako australia ke in jangi jahaazon ne tabah or barbaad kar diya
 The Sultanate of Baghdadi has undergone such a strong attack after a long time
 ye hamalaa bhi aisa tha jisane bagdadi kii qamar tod di or ab bagdadi jang ke maidan main munh dikhaane laayak bhi nahin bachaa he
 After Syria, Iraq, Russia and the United States, Australia's attacks have left it nowhere
 jangi jahaaz f / A-18 hornett fiter se austrailian dephence force ne iraq or syria main aise tabadatod hamale kiye ki bagdadi kii aakhri ummid bhi ab jaati rahi
 f / A-18 Hornet fighters equipped with heavy bombs were flown in from the nearest airbase
 puure josh se labarez australian air task group ke payalat is aasamaani afat ko lekar ude
 Together, dozens of fighter jets flew to destroy Baghdadi targets
 austrailian dephence force kar rahi he IS ko tabahjo hawa se hawa main or hawa se zamin par maar karne kii tamaam salahiyaton se las the
 And once they reached the Sultanate of Barbadadi, as soon as they got the signal from the control room, the pilots in the fighter jet pressed the trigger simultaneously
 trigar dabate hi fiter jet main lage bamon ne iesas ke thikaanon par dhaava bol diya
 The first attacked were the areas in northern Iraq where terrorists were making bombs
 bagdadi ke aatankiyon ne yahaan baqayada bam banane kii factory khol rakhi thi
 And as the bomb ravaged these places, its smoke and the sound of the explosion were heard from several kilometers away
 is dauraan ek ajeeb tasviir bhi camere main ricard hui
 Photos of something like a missile were recorded even after the bomb fell and exploded
 iraq main iesas ke aatanki thikaanon ko tabah karne ke baad austrailian dephence force ne syria kaa ruukh kiya or vahaan bhi bam giraae
 The process of dropping the oil filling work in the air continued until Operation Okra was completed
 yahi naam diya gaya tha bagdadi ke hathiyaaron kii factory ko tabah karne vaale is oparation ko
 During the operation there was a time when many Australian fighter jets started running out of oil
 magar bina mishan puraa kiye waapas airbase main jaakar tel bharne ke bajaae payalton ne hawa main hi tel bharne kaa kaam puraa kar liya
 The Australian military's air task group air operations in Iraq and Syria have increased significantly since Trump became US President
 australia ke raksha vibhaag ne khud conform kiya he ki usne austrailian dephence force ke kareeb 780 jawan utaare hue hai
 About 300 of them belong to the Air Task Group of Australia
 jabaki 80 special oparation task group ke commando or 300 task group taaji ke hai
 It is believed that not only the ISIS weapons have been completely destroyed in this attack of the Australian Force, but many of its terrorists have also been killed
 maare gaye aatankiyon kaa aankada nahin kiya gaya jarihalanki abhi tak kisi bhi agency ne maare gaye aatankiyon kii taadaad kaa aankada jari nahin kiya he
 Well, you have understood Operation Okra, but perhaps you have not noticed that which is the cause of the fear of Baghdadi
 or wo baat ye he ki australian dephence force aatank ke safaaye ke liye apane 80 special commando iraq or syria bhej rahaa he
 These are the commandos who shoot first and listen later
 galati or raham in donon chizon kii gunjaaish inke paas katai nahin he
 a special commando of the Australian Defense Force is heavy on 80-80 terrorists
 to sochie jin 80 special commando ko australian sena ne iraq or syria main aatank se jang ke liye bhejne kaa faisla kiya he wo aatankiyon kaa kya hashr karengen
 They have no match in water, land and sky
 nishaanaa aisa ki galati ki gunjaaish na ke baraabar samajhie
 It is not possible that the terrorist escapes
 IS aatankiyon ke khatme kaa blueprint taiyaarakahane kii zarurat nahin ki agar jang ke maidan main ye utar gaye to aatankiyon kii khayr nahin
 Now consider the hide and seek of terrorists in Iraq and Syria
 kyonki australia ne faisla kar liya he ki uski dephence force ke ek-do nahin balki 80-80 special commando aatankiyon ke safaaye ke liye iraq or syrian sarazamiin par utarane vaale hai
 Who will kill the operatives of Baghdadi by entering into their bills
 aatank ke khatme ke liye ab tak ke is sabase khatarnaak plan kaa blueprint taiyaar kiya ja chukaa he
 When, where and how
 kis tarah insaaniyat ke in nasuron kaa oparation karke inhen jahannum bheja jayega, ye sab ab duniya bahut jald dekhegi
 Actually, they are the most dangerous commandos in the world, who also drag the enemy from the ground
 kyonki ye australia ke wo commando hai, jinka oparation kabhi naakaamayaab nahin hota
 And now the same force is going to be broken on Baghdadi's terrorists
 jald jeet ke utaare jate hai ye commandoapaki jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki inhen tab hi maidan main utaara jaataa he, jab jeet jald se jald chahie hoti he
 And now it has been decided that these special commandos of Australia are going to get into the maidan-e-jung very soon after swearing off the ISIS
 or ek baar ye pahunch gaye to phir aatankiyon kii kilabandi ko todane main inhen zyada vakt nahin lagegaa
 They will give a befitting reply to every shot of terror
 jihad to tab hoga jab aatanki zindaa bachenge or maujuuda halaat dekhte hue aisa lagata he ki iesas ke aatankiyon kii kahani ab bas khatm he
 Well, the story of Baghdadi is not much left
 isiilie jab jaan ke laale padane lage to aatank ke is aakaa ne khud apane aatankiyon se kah diya he, jaan bachaakar bhaago or agar pakade jane kaa dar ho to khud ko dhamaake se uda lenaa
 There are so many attacks on this terrorist boss in Syria and Iraq that now his courage has started to answer
 ukhdane lagi hai aatankiyon kii jameenabagdadi ke aatankiyon ke pair ukhdane lage hai
 The areas where the terrorists of abu-bakr-al-baghdadi and its terrorist organization Islamic State had created havoc, now there is no place to hide their heads
 or ab to jaan ke laale pade hue hai
 Allied forces, including the US, Russia, Syria and Iraq, surround it
 america main hukumat badalane ke baad se to mitra deshon kii senaaon ke hamale bhi or tej ho gaye hai
 The time for the complete elimination of the empire of terror due to these attacks is now very close
 kyonki apane jin gurgon par use sabase zyaada yakeen tha unka dhire dhire khaatmaa hota ja rahaa he
 Now the situation is that let alone the terrorists, Baghdadi has started worrying about her life
 jaan bachaane ke liye wo maaraa-maaraa phir rahaa he
 Perhaps he too has now realized that death can ever surround him in his claws
 or uskaa khaatmaa tay he
 Told the terrorists - Go back to your country, that's why he has decided that he will free the terrorists who are in his sultanate from their shelter
 bagdadi ke behad karibiyon ne ye khulaasa kiya he ki usne apane aatankiyon se kah diya he ki haar tay he
 So if you can save your life, save it
 jo apane-apane desh lautnaa chaahate hai wo laut jaaen or jo na laut paaen or pakade jane kaa dar ho to khud ko dhamaake se uda len
 This revelation from the Sultanate of Baghdadi is telling how the world's biggest terrorist has now become helpless
 isiilie wo apane aatankiyon ko iraq or syria se nikalakar duusare deshon main jaakar thikaana banane or iesas ke mishan ko puraa karne kii salaah de rahaa he
 And if this happens, then believe that even after the end of Iraq and Syria, Baghdadi henchmen will be present in the whole world

 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in the investigation that the viral picture has been prepared with the help of Photoshop

 a person is seen behind them in the picture
 viral tasviir main photoshop kii madad se is vyakti ke chehre kii jagah chota rajan kaa cheharaa laga diya gaya he
 On comparing the real picture and viral picture, it can be seen that apart from the face of the person, the picture of the rest of the body is exactly the same
 artical main suresh jaani ko kot karte hue likhaa gaya he: 'jab modi pehali baar 1993 main america aae the tab main unhen lene airport gaya tha
 He then came to America in 1997 and again in 2000

 ek gyaat aatankwaadi ko agar sahi tareeke se sazaa nahin di ja rahi he, to vah na sirf bharat, balki duniyabar ke liye khatra he

 Home Minister Rajnath Singh is saying that at a time when India is once again trying to start talks with Pakistan, Lakhvi's release from jail is unfortunate and disappointing
 lekin aise main sawaal uthta he ki bharat ke paas vikalp kya hai
 He has expressed his displeasure

 Sources said that Germany is in touch with several EU member states to declare Masood as a global terrorist
 yadi aisa hota he to sangh ke 28 sadsy deshon main masood ke yatra karne par roak lag jaaegi or in deshon main uski sabhi sampattiyaan jabt ho jaaengi
 Diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that Germany has submitted a suggestion regarding the banning of Masood by the European Union, but no proposal has yet been submitted in this regard
 unhone bataaya ki masood ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne ke kadam ko europea sangh ke sabhi deshon kii manjuuri kii aavashyaktaa hogi kyonki is prakaar ke maamalon par iyu sarvasammati se faisla karata he
 France had earlier imposed financial sanctions on Masood on 15 March, saying that it would work closely with its European allies to put Masood's name in the eu's list of people involved in terrorist acts

 If you want to visit the Himalayas, then the weather is the best season
 is samay ki agar ham baat karte hai to oktober kaa doosraa pakhwada he or himalay ke zyaadaatar ilaakon main mausam saaf he
 That is, the sun shone in the day and the starry sky at night
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik is samay desh ke bade hisse se monsoon vaapasi kar chukaa he or koi bhi taqatvar western disturbance himalay main philhal nahin aane ja rahaa he
 Due to this, the weather will remain pleasant in all areas of North West Himalayas for the next 15 days
 aise main pahari ilaakon main ghoomane ke shaukeen logon ke liye yah mausam anukool he
 According to the latest meteorological data, at this time the monsoon has made a withdrawal from all parts of Northeast India, entire parts of the Bay of Northeast Bengal, most parts of Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, Karnataka and a large part of the Central Arabian Sea
 is samay monsoon kii vaapasi kii rekha tirupati, bengalooru, mangaluru se hokar guzar rahi he pichley 24 ghante kii baat karen to puure desh main andaman or nicobar chhodkar kahin par bhi barish record nahin kii gai he

 The Meteorological Department says that this situation will remain intact for the next 7 days, that is, the sunny daylight will keep the temperature above normal in most areas
 lekin khaas baat yah he kii jameen par chalane vaali hawaaen is samay thodaa tej hai, jisaki vajah se logon ko zyada garmi mahasoos nahin ho rahi he
 See the high peaks of the Himalayas, the weather department says that this time is after the monsoon
 is vajah se himalay ke tamaam kshetron main sukha mausam nahin he
 At the same time, there is plenty of greenery in all the hilly areas
 is vajah se zyaadaatar hill steshnon par mausam suhaavna bana hua he or isi ke saath barish naa hone kii vajah se bhuskhalan jaisi sthiti bhi kahin par bhi paidaa nahin hone ja rahi he
 In such a situation, it can be quite comfortable to visit hill stations like Nainital, Manali, Almora, Kausani, Shimla, Patnitop
 khaas baat yah he ki is samay mausam saaf hone kii vajah se himalay kii oonchi-oonchi chotiyaan saaf saaf dekhi ja sakati hai

 sarkaar ne kaha ki privet aspataalon main bhi free surgery yojana shuru kii gai he

 ve poochhate hai ki kya nijee aspataalon main surgery ke liye commercial rate liya jaataa he
 It may not be practical for any government to pay at those rates, in which case the government should tell how it will treat people
 manoj tiwari sarkaar se poochhate hai ki janata ko bataaya jaae ki kya unhen nijee aspataalo main oparation ke liye bheja jaayegaa to shesh ilagesarkaari aspataalmen hoga ki nijee aspataal main hoga? isi tarah oparation ke baad hone vaali dekharekh kii jimmedaari nijee aspataal kii hogi yaa phir sarkari aspataal kii or yadi sarkari aspataal dwaara kisi nijee aspataal main bheje marij ke saath koi swasthya haani hoti he to uski jimmedaari kiski hogi?manoj tiwari ne sawaal uthaae ki aakhiram aadmi partidwara apane chunavi ghoshnaa-patr main 900 naye primary health centre, sarkari aspataalon main 30,000 nae bistar jinamein ki 4,000 bistar jaccha-baccha ke liye hone the or prayek 1,000 vyaktiyon ke liye antarrashtriya str ke paanch bistar ke intjaam vaale vaayade kaa kya hua?ve kehete hai ki kejariwal sarkaar prashasan ke anya kaaryon kii tarah swasthya sevaaon ke maamle main bhi dilli kii janata kaa vishwaas puri tarah kho chuki he

 The party's first list of candidates for Gujarat will be officially announced on 16 November
 congress gujarat ke is chunaav main puri koshish kar rahi he ki sampradayik aadhaar par voton kaa dhruvikaran naa hone paae

 14 tickets for the first phase
 alpesh thakor kaa asaralpesh thakor is chunaav prachaar ke dauraan hi aadhikarik taur par congress main shaamil ho chuke hai
 Congress has decided to give 12 tickets to OBC / Thakor in the first phase
 congress ne PODA (patidaar, obisi, dalit, adivasee) ko saadhane ke saath hi 5 kshatriya ummidavaaron ko bhi pehle charan main utaarne kii taiyaari kii he
 According to the sources, apart from this, the youth associated with Youth Congress and NSUI have made up their mind to give 6 tickets
