 The natural friendship, opposition and neutrality of the planets, and the beliefs of immediate xenophobia, harmony and equanimity are considered as the cornerstone for the horoscope
 isi prakaar surya aadi saat grahon ko kramash: aatma, man, shakti, vaani, gyaan, kaam, du:kha, tathaa mesh aadi baarah raashiyon kii kram se shir, mukh, ur hriday, udar, kati, vasti, ling, uru, ghutana, jangha or charan aadi kii kalpanaayen, praaniyon kii maansik avasthaa tathaa shaareerik vikruti, chihn aadi ko bataane ke liye kii gai hai

 The different elements of the entire life span of beings are the result of the conditions and intuitions of the planets affected in different forms
 jivan main koun-sa samay sukhadaayak tathaa koun-sa arishthprad hoga, bhagyoday kab hoga, mata, pita, bandhu, santati, stri aadi kaa sukh kab kaisaa rahegaa, vivaah kab hoga, koun-si grahadasha jivan main samruddhi udel degi or kis grah kii dasha main dar-dar kii khaak chanani padegi, sabase badhkar kis samay is sansar ko sadaa ke liye chhod dena hoga ityadi sabhi baton kaa samay, grahon kii dashaon or antardashaon se hi suchit kiya jaataa he
 The constellation of the natal Moon is the head for calculating the planet Dasha

 Thus by dividing the number from the Kritika to the natal moon of the natal moon, the rest of the planet whose number will be considered in the birth time and the time spent before the birth of the planet and the birth of the planet from the Panchaganya Bhoga period of the constellation
 Subsequent enjoyment periods are presented to the future disciples
 yadi grah kundali main apane grih yaa mitra ke grih main ho athwa ucch kaa ho to vah jis bhav kaa swami hoga, uskaa fal uttam hoga tathaa shatru ke grih main athwa neech raashi main uske sthit hone par fal nikrusht hoga
 Now the question arises that all calculations are started from Ashwini nakshatra
 phir grahadasha kii gananaa krittika se kyon kii jaati he
 The fact is that our planetary prediction has been going on since our Nakshatra calculation started from Kritika
 maharishi garg ne vedikakaal main do swatantra nakshatra gananaaon kaa ullekh kiya he- ek krittikadi or duusari dhanishthadi
 Garga sentence is that - Tesham sarveshan nakshatranam karmasu kritika prathamacchakshte shravishtu numeya: Poorva lagnanam means that in all nakshatras, krittika is said to be the first among the deeds of fire etc
 rahasy yah he ki jis samay krittika kaa tarapunj vishavadvrutt main tha us samay krittikadi nakshatra gananaa kaa aarambh hua

 When calculated according to the celestial position of the rod, this time proves to be about 5100 years ago

 The condition of our horoscope, influenced by the sequence of inferences, the Arab countrymen started a new system of the year, called 'tajik'
 isamen praani ke janm kaal se saura varsh kii purti ke samay kaa lagn laakar ek varsh ke andar honevaale shubhashubhon kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he
 It has a predominance of 16 yogas in which profit, loss and physical condition are considered
 in 16 yogon ke naam arabi bhashaa ke hi hai sanskrit granthon main unke naam uccharan ke anusaar kuch parivartit ho gaye he yatha, iqbaal asharaf, ittsaal aadi
 At present, the system of the birth chart of the horoscope by doing twelve parts of the zodiac is not mentioned in the ancient Vedic literature of India
 kintu atharv jyotish main bahut pehle se hi is paddati ke mul tatv nihit hai
 In this, nine parts of the 27 constellations of the zodiac are considered as one part of each of the three constellations
 inamen pratham 'janm nakshatra', dasavaan 'karm nakshatra' tathaa unnisvan 'aadhaan nakshatra' mana gaya he
 The rest is considered to be Sampat, Vipat, Kshemya, Pratvar, Sadhak, Naidhan, Maitra and Param Maitra in the order, such as- inamen janm, sampat or naidhan arthath 1, 2 or 7, dwadash bhavvaali janmkundali ke 1, 2 or 8 sthanon se milte hai
 Atharva is the tenth Karma constellation in astrology
 aadhunik paddati main bhi dasham sthaan karm he
 This proves that the nine places in Atharva astrology are interwoven into some of the twelve places of the present horoscope, which existed in our method of preaching before the introduction of nouns like Aries
 purv kshitij main laganevaale nakshatron ko lagn nakshatra maanane kaa varnan 3300 varsh pracheen vedang jyotish main bhi he
 Such as - Sravishtabhyo Gunabhyastan Pragvilagnan Specificand
 arthath gun teen kii gananaa kar ghanishta se purv kshitij main lage nakshatron ko bataanaa chahie
 From this it becomes clear that at that time the nine parts of the Nakshatra Chakra were done by dividing three into 27 Nakshatras
 atharv jyotish ke nav vibhaagon kaa saamanjasy isse ho jaataa he
 European scholars believe that twelve parts or twelve zodiac signs of the constellation cycle came from outside India
 kintu hamaare vaidic sahitya main surya kii gati ke aadhaar par nakshatra chakra ke baarah bhaag or chandramaa kii dainik gati ke aadhaar par 27 bhaag pehle se kiye gaye hai
 Although the stories related to the constellations and the moon are in our Puranas, there are no stories of the Meshadi zodiacs but in the Greek literature
 phir bhi itane se hi siddh nahin hota ki rashigananaa or bhav bharat main baahar se aae
 The statements of European scholars are giving evidence to the contrary
 jaikobi kaa kathan he ki janmkundali main dwadash grihon se fal bataane kii paddati formikas matternas ke granth main milti he
 It is also known here that no Jataka texts are known in Greece even before Ptolemy
 tolemi ke do jataka granth almijasti or titrabiblas kahe jate hai kintu yah pramanit nahin he
 It is not possible to have 6 Aryan writers and five Arasha writers in the pre-250 years of Varahamihira, if the preaching of the book of Parmicus Maternus was accepted as true in India after 354 AD
 varahamihir ne apane purvavarti may yavan, manittth, satya, vishnugupt aadi aacharyon kaa naam liya he
 Bhattottapal, the commentator of Brihajatak, holds that he is Acharya Chanakya, the minister of Vishnugupta Moon
 is prakaar yah hamaari rashigananaa paddati isvi san se 300 varsh purv kii siddh hoti he
 This does not make the statement that the census came from outside India
 brihatsamhita ke grahacharadhyay main grahagochar fal die hai
 Chandra is the first place in it
 us adhyay main 'mandavy' kaa ullekh he
 Mandavya is a great writer
 mandavy ke granth main chandrakundali mukhya thi athwa usamen chandramaa ke sthaan se vichaar kiya gaya tha
 This idea was from 9 places of Atharva Jyatish
 10 raashiyon ke prachaar main aane ke baad iskaa vichaar 12 bhaavon se hone laga
 Therefore, it is only reasonable to assume that the method of horoscope was practiced by a sage like Garga etc
 kyonki isvi san se 500 varsh purv vidyaman vishisht siddhant main bhi lagn or bhaavon kii kalpana he
 Some zodiac signs and Greek names in Indian astrology are proof that we had ancient contact with the Greeks
 unase anek vidyaon or kalaon kaa aadan-pradaan bhi hua
 Varahamihira has written that- isse yah nishkarsh nahin nikaalnaa chahie ki hamaara sara kaa sara jatakashastra udhaar liya gaya he
 Knowing the method of Indian horoscope, the Greeks expanded it and presented it in a new form to the Indians in the time of Varahamihira
 falat: varahamihir ne unki hora, dreshkan aadi naveen paddatiyon ke saath raashiyon ke naam bhi unani hi rakh liye, jaise aaj hamaara bijganit arabon dwaara europe main failaayaa jaakar apane bahad rup main pun: bharat lautakar naveen ganit ke naam se vikhyath hua he
 Just as there are twelve zodiac signs in the sky, in the present time there are twelve expressions in the horoscope
 janm kundali yaa janmang chakra main kisi ke janm samay main akaash kii us janm sthaan par kya sthiti thi, iskaa akashi naksh he
 The chart of the twelve mines is made in Janmang

 Historians believe that the Ezhavas of Kerala were soldiers of the Villavar tribe who established the Chera Empire
 travnakor ke villavaaron ko 'ilavar' naam se janaa jaataa tha
 The word Elavar is derived from Villavar, meaning archer, a warrior caste of the Dravidians who ruled most of South India

 Mahakavi Kumaranasan, whose writings such as Nalini, Leela, Karuna and Chandal Bhiksuki have praised Buddhist ideals, have at that time mourned the former pride of Sinhalese or Sri Lankan residents, whom they call ancestors of the current Ezhavas
 Believed is buddha parampara or ise chhodane se unke inkaar ke kaaran vrihad brahmanvaadi samaaj main ejhaavaon ko jati bahishkrut kar diya gaya
 Nevertheless, this tradition still continues unequivocally as the Ezhavas take a greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic and non-orthodox aspects of religion rather than spirituality
 anuvanshik adhyayan bataate hai ki ek dwi-aiami kshetra main ejhaavaon kaa, -bi or -si aavritiyon par aadhaarit he), ek hi bhukhand main mongol aabaadi kii nikatataa ke kaaran, yugmavikalpi vitaran kaa kahin majboot ureshian tatv he
 The most widely accepted theory is that the practices and beliefs of the Ezhavas and Thiyyas are very ancient and have their origins in the almost bleak days of the ancient Tamil Sangam-pre-days
 unki tamil prishthbhumi ne unhen bhagwaan muruga or devi kaali tathaa chathan, chithan or arathan jaise anek anya gramin devi-devtaa die
 Although there is not enough evidence that the Ezhavas came from northern Sri Lanka, the principle of their existence in Sri Lanka in the first centuries BCE cannot be ignored

 He is also known as Ezhinar in Kerala, which sounds like 'ezhava'
 kuch logon dwaara yah bhi mana jaataa he ki ejhava shabd ejhaam / ilam se vyutpann he
 These words are believed to be linguistically or socio-linguistically related to a group of words like Elu / Hela / Sihala / Simhala / Sinhala / Salai / Siladiba / Serendib, alluding to the island of Sri Lanka

 But the original word, its etymology, its meaning and how the original word became the name of the island has not yet been known despite the discussion continuing
 ejhava cher rajvansh ke sansthaapak villavaaron ke vanshaj hai
 The word 'illawar' is derived from Villavar

 The Villavaras were also known as Ezhinar or Aiyinar respectively in the Chera and Tamil countries
 'ekkinar' shabd sunne main bade had tak 'ejhava' jaisaa lagata he, jinhen 'ejhavar' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Villavar means archer
 He was a warrior among the Dravidians who ruled much of India in ancient times with their allied Meenavars
 villawaron ne cher samrajya kii sthapana kii thi or cherraja ko vilawar raja kaha jaataa tha
 The Villavar caste of Kerala which established the Chera empire is called Villavar

 The first mention of the word Ezhava was found in the third-century Arittapatti inscriptions of Madurai around BC, stating 'this auspicious cave was carved out of the Eelava Perumal, the chief of Nelveli'
 The inscription of the famous Kilaavalavu Jain cave in the third century BC mentions an Ezhavan who built a Buddhist monastery there

 In support of this theory, it is said that, in South Travancore, the Ezhavas are known as Mudaliars, which is also a surname of a division of the Vellalas of Jaffna; That Vatti and Mannan call them Mudaliyars; And that Pulaya was simply known as Mutha Tampuran
 lekin yah bhalee-bhaanti mana ja saktaa he ki rajya kii saraahneey sevaaon ke liye yah khitaab jati ke ejhava pariwaron ko pradaan kiya gaya tha
 According to another legend and some Malayalam folk songs, Ezhava is the child of four unmarried men sent to Kerala by the King of Sri Lanka at the request of Chera Raja Bhaskar Ravi Varma in the first century AD
 Apparently, these people were sent to Kerala to organize coconut farming

 Folklore and written records indicate that the Ezhavas were also of the warrior class
 lagbhag 400 saal pehle rachit vadakkan pattukal naamak ejhava lok geet main ejhava veeron ke sainik parakram ke varnan hai
 There were Ezhavas in the armed forces of all the important kings of the region, such as the Zamorin of Calicut and the army of the kings of Travancore and Cochin
 Many were appointed as guards or guards in the palaces of Cochin and Travancore

 For the religion of Islam and all the Muslims of the world, if any book is of the highest importance after the Holy Qur'an, then the Hadiths are, for some, it is as much as the Qur'an which believes that every statement of Prophet Muhammad is every thing of his
 There are divine messages without which it is not possible to understand the Qur'an, that is, their words are understood in the behavioral detail of the Qur'an

 One of the many reasons for the disorder that had occurred in earlier religious texts, when Islam re-emerged with the conversion of Hazrat Muhammad to Rasul, was that ish-vani, the statement of Rasool and others The statements of humans and religious leaders, preachers, readers, reformers and theologians, etc
 were also mixed together

 Vali or Bali is a character in the Ramayana
 vah sugriv kaa bada bhai tha
 He was the king of Kishkindha and is said to be the son of Indra
 vishnu ke avatar ram ne uskaa vadh kiya
 Although Vali has been described from chapters 5 to 26 out of the 67 chapters of the book Kishkindhandak in the Ramayana, Vali has had a major role in the Ramayana, especially his slaughter
 wali ke janm ko lekar ek rochak prasang maujuud he
 It is said that Vali was the son of Indra and Arun
 indra devataaon ke raja the or arun suryadev ke sarathi
 It is believed that Surya comes in the morning in the chariot of seven white horses, which is run by Arun
 ek baar kii baat he ki kisi rishi ne surya ko yah shaap de diya ki vah prithvi ke upar prakaashmaan nahin honge
 Because the sun stopped the chariot after this, so Arun had no work
 arun kii pehle se hi swarg lok main jaakar apsaraon kaa divya nrity dekhne kii ichha rahi thi
 Taking advantage of this opportunity, she dressed as a young lady and reached heaven to watch the dance of the Apsaras
 indra, jo ki is nrity kaa anand le rahe the, ne arun rupi yuvati ko dekha or usapar mohit ho gayi
 The two met and Arun eventually gave birth to Vali
 wali kaa paalan-poshan gautam rishi kii patni ahilya ne kiya
 Monkey king wali kaa vivaah vanar vaidyaraj sushen kii putree tara ke saath sampann hua tha
 According to a legend, during the Samudra Manthan, one of the fourteen monies were nymphs
 unheen apsaraon main se ek tara thi
 Both Vali and Sushen were helping the deities in the manthan
 jab unhone tara ko dekha to donon main use patni banane kii hode lagi
 Vali stood on the right side of Tara and Sushen on his left
 tab vishnu ne faisalaa sunaaya ki vivaah ke samay kanya ke dahini taraf uskaa hone vaala pati tathaa baayin taraf kanyadan karne vaala pita hota he
 Hence Vali Tara's husband and Sushen were declared her father
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki wali ko uske pita indra se ek swarna haar praapt hua jisko brahma ne mantrayukt karke yah vardaan diya tha ki isko pahanakar vah jab bhi ranbhumi main apane dushman kaa saamana karegaa to uske dushman kii aadhi shakti ksheen ho jaayegi or wali ko praapt ho jaayegi
 For this reason Vali was almost invincible
 ramayana main aisa prasang aata he ki ek baar jab wali sandhyavandan ke liye ja rahaa tha to akaash se naarad muni ja rahe the
 When Vali greeted him, Narada told that he was going to Lanka where Lankapati Ravana organized a feast to commemorate the defeat of Devraj Indra
 chanchal swabhaav ke naarad – jinhen sarvagyaan he – ne wali se chutki lene kii koshish kii or kaha ki ab to puure brahmand main keval ravan kaa hi aadhipaty he or saare praani, yahan tak ki devatagan bhi use hi sheesh navate hai
 Vali said that Ravana has used his boon and his army to suppress those who are weak but i am not among them and you should make this point clear to Ravana
 sarvagyani naarad ne yahi baat ravan ko ja kar bataai jise sunakar ravan krodhit ho gaya
 He gave orders to prepare his army
 naarad ne usase bhi chutki lete huye kaha ki ek vanar ke liye yadi aap puri sena lekar jaayenge to aapke sammaan ke liye yah uchit nahin hoga
 Ravana immediately agreed and sat in his Pushpak plane and reached near Vali
 wali us samay sandhyavandan kar rahaa tha
 Seeing the golden radiance of Vali, Ravana got nervous and tried to attack Vali from behind
 wali apni puja archana main tallin tha lekin phir bhi usne use apni punch se pakadakar or uskaa sir apane bagal main dabaakar puure vishwa main ghumaya
 He did this so that the creatures of the whole world see Ravana in this helpless state and his fear is removed from his mind
 iske pashchaat ravan ne apni paraajay sweekaar kii or wali kii ore maitri kaa haath badhaayaa jise wali ne sweekaar kar liya
 The demon named Maya had two sons - Mayavi and Dundubhi
 dundubhi mahish rupi asur tha
 The great Dundubhi was so enthralled by the mountain that he challenged Sagar Raj for a duel war
 haalaanki sagar raaj uskaa dambh vahiin khatm kar sakate the lekin unhone kaha ki aise vir se vah dwandv karne main asamarth hai tathaa dundubhi ko giriyon ke raja himavan ke paas jane ko kaha
 When Dundubhi went to Himwan, Himwan also refused to fight with him and suggested to challenge Indra's son Vali who was the king of Kishkindha
 dundubhi tab kiskindha ke dwaar main gaya or wali ko dwandv ke liye lalakaara
 Madamasta Wali first tried to convince Dumbubhi, but when he did not agree, Vali agreed to the duel and beat Dundubhi very easily and killed her
 iske pashchaat wali ne dundubhi ke nirjeev sharir ko uchhaalkar ek hi jatke main ek yojan dur phenk diya
 Droplets of blood dripping from the body fell into the hermitage of Maharishi Matang, which was located in Rishimuk mountain
 krodhit matang ne wali ko shaap de daalaa ki yadi wali kabhi bhi unke ashram ke ek yojan ke daayre main aayaa to vah mrityu ko praapt hoga
 It is also mentioned in the Kishkindha Kanda of Ramayana that the daily used to go to the west coast and north to south coasts from the east coast to offer water to the sun
 raste main ai pahaado kii chotiyon ko vah aise upar phenkata tha or punah pakad letaa tha maano vah koi gend hon
 Even after this, when he returned after sun worshiping, he did not get tired
 wali ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki yadi koi use dwandv ke liye lalakaare to vah turant taiyaar ho jaataa tha
 Dundubhi's elder brother Mayavi had a great old enmity with a woman
 mayavi ek raat kiskindha aayaa or wali ko dwandv ke liye lalakaara
 Despite the refusal of women and well-wishers, Vali ran after that demon
 saath main sugriv bhi uske saath tha
 Rushing into the elusive land, he entered a tomb
 wali bhi uske peeche-peeche gaya
 Before leaving, he ordered Sugriva to guard Sugriva by standing at the mouth of the tomb until he came back after killing the elusive
 ek varsh se adhik interval ke pashchaat kandara ke muhane se rakt bahata hua baahar aayaa
 Sugriva listened to the asura of the demon, but not the brother
 yah samajhakar ki uskaa agraj ran main maaraa gaya, sugriv ne us kandara ke munh ko ek shila se band kar diya or waapas kiskindha aa gaya jahaan usne yah samachar sabko sunaaya
 The ministers, after consulting him, crowned Sugriva
 kuch samay pashchaat wali prakat hua or apane anuj ko raja dekh bahut kupit hua
 Sugriva tried his best to convince him, but Vali did not listen to him and grabbed Sugriva's kingdom and wife Ruma and expelled him
 dar ke kaaran sugriv ne rishyamook parvat main sharan lee jahaan shaap ke kaaran wali nahin ja saktaa tha
 This is where Sugriva met Rama due to Hanuman
 ram ke yah aashwaasan dene par ki ram swayan wali kaa vadh karenge, sugriv ne wali ko lalakaara
 Vali came out hearing the challenge
 donon main ghamaasan yuddh hua, parantu kyonki dono bhaaiyon kii mukh tathaa deh rachana samaan thi, isliye ram ne asamanjas ke kaaran apana baan nahin chalaaya
 Eventually Vali defeated Sugriva and drove him away
 sugriv niraash hokar phir ram ke paas aa gaya
 Rama this time asked Lakshmana to put a garland around Sugriva's neck so that he would not make any mistake in recognizing Sugriva during the duel and asked Sugriva to challenge Vali again
 hataash sugriv phir se kiskindha ke dwaar kii ore wali ko lalkaarane ke liye chal padaa
 When Vali again heard Sugriva's shout, he could not bear the brunt of his anger
 tara ko shaayad is baat kaa bodh ho gaya tha ki sugriv ko ram kaa sangrakshan hasil he kyonki akele to sugriv wali ko dobaaraa lalkaarane kii himmat kadaapi nahin karata
 So Tara tried to warn the Vali due to fear of something untoward
 usne yahan tak kaha ki sugriv ko kiskindha kaa yuvaraj ghoshit kar wali uske saath sandhi kar le
 But Vali reprimanded her with the suspicion that Tara was taking an unfair side of Sugriva
 kintu usne tara ko yah aashwaasan diya ki vah sugriv kaa vadh nahin karegaa or sirf use acha sabak sikhaayegaa
 The duel started again between the two brothers, but this time Rama did not make any mistake in recognizing the two brothers and he fired an arrow with a tree
 baan ne wali ke hriday ko bedh daalaa or vah dharashaayi hokar zamin par gir gaya
 The mortal who fell on earth posed many questions to Rama, whose essence is as follows: - ramayana main valmiki ne in prashnon ke jawaab dene kii yathasambhav cheshtaa kii he, parantu koi thos jawaab ke abhaav main ramayana par tippanee karne waalon ne apane-apane andaaz main is prakaran ko uchit sabit karne kii koshish kii he
 According to Kritivasi Ramayana, the Bengali version of the Ramayana, Tara curses Rama that in the next life he will be killed in the same way at the hands of Rama Vali, because perhaps the author of this Ramayana found the whole episode to be irrational and thus resolved the episode

 Monocot or monocot is a group of flowering plants whose seeds have the same cotyledon

 According to the 2010 census the communities of Orenburg Oblast were: Russian, Tatar, Kazakh, Ukrainian, Bashkir, Mordavini, German, Chuvash, Azeri and Belarusian
 kaaran jo kaary ke purv main niyat rup se rahata he or anyathaasiddhi na ho use kaaran nahin kehete hai
 Just by being in the forefront of the work does not lose its causality, it should also be the interviewing partner in the production of the work
 anyathaasiddh main un tathakthith kaarnon kaa samavesh hota he jo kaary kii utpatti ke purv rahete hai par kaary ke utpaadan main saakshaat upyogi nahin he
 Just like the potter's father or the donkey carrying the soil is indebted to work
 kaary-kaaran-sambandh anyavyatirek par aadhaarit he
 Work happens when there is a reason, there is no work if there is no reason
 prakruti main praaia: kaary-kaaran-sambandh spasht nahin rahata
 There are many reasons for a task
 hamen un anek dikhaai denevaale kaarnon main se vaastavik kaaran foondnaa padataa he
 For this, one has to carefully remove the reasons for each visible action and see if the work is generated
 yadi kaary utpann hota he to jisko hataaya gaya he vah kaaran nahin he
 What remains in the end is believed to be the real reason
 yah mana gaya he ki yah kaary kaa ek hi kaaran hota he anyathaa anumaan kii pramanikta nasht ho jaaegi
 If there are many causes of dhoom, then it would be wrong to predict fire by dhoom
 jahaan anek kaaran dikhaai dete hai vahaan kaary kaa vishleshan karne par maaloom hoga ki kaary ke anek avyav kaaran ke anek avyavon se utpann hai
 Thus, there can be a causal relationship with the work
 kaaranvishesh ke samooh se kaarivishesh ke samooh kaa utpann maananaa bhul he
 In fact, many factors in a group form do not generate work in a particular group
 ve alag-alag hi kaarivishesh ke kaaran hai
 There can be two kinds of fixed living before work
 kaaran kaary ke utpaadan ke pehle to rahata he parantu kaary ke us kaaran se pruthak utpann hota he
 The reason remains cooperative only in the production of new work
 mitti se gadaa banataa he at: mitti ghade kaa kaaran he or vah kumhaar bhi jo mitti ko ghade kaa rup detaa he
 Before the potter's trade, the soil was clay and the pitcher had no existence
 kumhaar ke sahyog se ghade kii utpatti hoti he at: gadaa naveen kaary he jo pehle kabhi nahin tha
 This theory is called Initialism
 kaaran naveen kaary kaa aarambhk hota he, kaaran swayan kaary rup main parinat nahin hota
 Although soil, potter, chalk etc
 are helpful in the production of work, these are not separate works and neither pitcher is produced in collaboration with all these but it is the most unique achievement
 avyavon se avyavi pruthak satta he; isi siddhant ke aadhaar par aarambhvaad kaa pravartan hota he
 In Indian philosophy, jurisprudential advocates of this principle
 kaary kaa kaaran ke saath sambandh duusari drushti se bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 a pitcher is made from clay, so the pitcher exists in a latent form
 yadi mitti na ho to chunki ghade kii avyakt sthiti nahin he at: gadaa utpann nahin hota
 Can be caused by a particular feature
 yadi kaary kaaran se bhinn naveen satta ho to koi vastu kisi kaaran se utpann ho sakati he
 Oil does not come out of sand instead of sesame because a rule of power is working in nature
 satta se hi satta kii utpatti hoti he
 Satya cannot be born of discrete - it will be contrary to the law of nature
 sankhyayog kaa yah siddhant parinamwad kehalaata he
 According to this, reason is transformed into action, so reason is essentially not separate from work
 in donon maton se bhinn ek mat or he jo na to kaaran ko aarambhk maanata he or na parinami
 The reason is tradeless power
 usamen kaary kii utpatti ke liye koi vyapaar nahin hota
 The reason is the embodied element
 parantu kutasthata ke hote hue bhi kaary utpann hota he
 The reason is the embodied element
 parantu kutasthata ke hote hue bhi kaary utpann hota he kyonki drashtaa ko agyaan aadi bahya oopaadhiyon ke kaaran kutasth kaaran apane shuddh rup main nahin dikhaai detaa
 Just as in the case of confusion, there is knowledge of the snake instead of a rope, similarly action appears in the place of reason
 at: karankarya kaa bhed tathvik bhed nahin he
 This distinction is formal
 is mat ko, jo advait vedant main sweekrut he, vivartvaad kehete hai
 In Initialism, the causes of work are different, in consequentialism, there is a distinction between the latent-expressed-state, despite not having an elemental distinction, but in tectarianism there is neither an elemental distinction nor a state
 kaary kaaran kaa bhed bhrant bhed he or bhram se jaayman kaary vastut: asat he
 As long as the vision is corrupted, then in practical condition they both appear separate
 drushtidosh kaa vilay hote hi kaary kaa vilay or kaaran ke shuddh rup ke gyaan kaa udai hota he
 Three genres of reason have been considered
 upadan kaaran vah kaaran he jisamen samavaay sambandh se rahakar kaary utpann hota he
 That is, the thing which forms the body of work is called gratuity
 mitti ghade kaa yaa taage kapade ke upadan kaaran hai
 This is also called the causal cause
 asamavaayi kaaran samavayi kaaran main samavaay sambandh se rahakar kaary kii utpatti main sahaayak hoti he
 The color of a hue, in a hue, which is the causal cause of a cloth, so the color of a hue is called the asexual cause of the cloth
 samavayi kaaran dravya hota he, parantu asamavaayi kaaran gun yaa kriya rup hota he
 The instrument causes motion in the causal cause, which creates the work
 kumhaar ghade kaa nimitt he kyonki vahi upadan se ghade kaa nirmaan karata he
 Unlike reason and non-time, all other reasons are called causal reasons
 arestu ke anusaar kaaran kii chauthi vidha bhi hoti he jise prayojak kaaran kahata he
 The purpose with which work is created is also the cause of work
 pani rakhane ke liye ghade kaa nirmaan hota he at: vah uddeshy ghade kaa prayojak kaaran he
 This fourth mode can be included in the instrument itself
 kaaran ke bare main aarambhvaad kaa siddhant nimitt kaaran ko mahatv detaa he
 Work is created for the fulfillment of a purpose, if it is completed with the objective things, there will be no need for the work
 at: nimitt se pruthak kaary kii sthiti he or uski purti ke liye nimitt upadan main gati detaa he
 God creates the world for the purpose of making the creatures enjoy their fruits
 parinamwad kaa jor upadan kaaran par he
 Speed is not given to the object, motion is the object of nature
 at: mukhya kaaran gati nahin apitu gati kaa aadhaar he
 Gratuity itself transforms into action, only to remove the cover of latency and to enlighten the sleeping motion
 kaaran ke bare main yadi kshanikwaad kaa ullekh na ho to vishay adhuraa hi rah jayega
 Gratitude is transient according to Buddhists due to the form of gratitude and instrument
 unki sthiti ek kshan se adhik nahin rah sakati
 Gratuity in such a situation when bihar kaa dakshini hissaa jo jharkhand rajya ke simavarti jila bankaa kaa ek prakhand he jo baunsi naam se janaa jaataa he baunsi kul 16 panchayaton kaa prakhand he isaki kul aabaadi 1

 Masturbation is the name of a general process related to physical psychology, which is done by men or women for sexual satisfaction
 ise keval yuva hi nahin balki budde-budde log bhi lingotthana hetu karte hai isse unhen yah ahsaas hota he ki ve abhi bhi yon-kriya karne main sakasham hai
 It is necessary for young boys and girls to stimulate their sexual organs when they are unable to get married due to some reason or they are abnormally strong
 ab to vigyaan dwaara bhi yah siddh kiya ja chukaa he ki isse koi haani nahin hoti
 Like men, women also find ways to stimulate their sexual organs, which gives them a very sensitive experience and strong stimulation
 phir chahen ve akeli hon yaa apni mahila partner ke saath
 If women do not stimulate their sexual organs themselves, there is a possibility that they will have to be deprived of adequate stimulation during sex after marriage
 ausat taur par purush 12-13 varsh kii umr main hi hastmaithun shuru kar dete hai jabaki mahilaayein tarunai ke antim daur main hastmaithun kaa anand lenaa shuru karti hai, lekin unamem yah maamla itnaa dhankaa or chipa hua rahata he ki kabhi kisi charchaa main bhi saamne nahin aa paata
 On getting full teenage, the matter of masturbation starts to tilt towards the open secret, but most people consider it better to let the curtain lie on the matter
 lekin ab jamaana bilkul badal gaya he
 Now some youths are getting ready who are breaking these taboo and taking an open part in the discussion on masturbation methods
 purush apane shishn yaa ling ko apni mutthi main dabaakar yaa apni anguliyaan se pakad kar ise teji se ragadnaa yaa shishn ke upar kii twachaa ko aage-peeche hilaanaa shuru karte hai
 Sometimes they do this by applying a lubricant on the penis
 is kaary main unhen apaar anand kii anubhuti hoti hai
 They continue this work until they ejaculate or ejaculate
 iske atirikt kabhi kabhaar purush takiye ke bich main apana ling dabaa kar dhire-dhire aage peeche dhakka dete hue is tarah hilaate hai maano ve kisi stri kii yoni main apana purushang pravishtha kar rahe hon
 Now many types of fake female genitalia are also available in the market which are made of soft fiber and give the same experience as female genitalia
 kuch purushon dwaara is prakaar ke upaay bhi swayan kii yon-santushti hetu kiye jate hai
 Women start moving or rubbing their vagina
 khaastaur par ve apane bhagosht ko apni tarjani yaa madhyamaa angulii se hilaati hai
 Sometimes, by inserting one or more fingers inside the vagina, they start moving the area where the g spot occurs, for which they also resort to vibrator or dildo
 bahut si mahilaayein iske saath saath apane vakshon ko bhi ragadati hai
 Some women also stimulate the anus by putting a finger
 kuch iske liye kritrim chiknayee kaa prayog bhi karti he lekin bahut si mahilaayein prakritik chiknayee ko hi kaaphi samajhati hai
 Some women reach Madanottasha with mere thought and thinking
 kuch mahilaayein apni taangen kasakar band kar leti hai or itnaa dabaav daalati hai jisase unhen swat: yon-sukh anubhav ho jaataa he
 They do this work in public places without anyone's eyes
 is kriya ko mahilaayein bistar par sidhi yaa ulti letkar, kursi par baithkar yaa ukaduun baithkar bhi karti hai
 But any such action which is completed without physical contact does not fall into this category
 bharatvarsh main mahilaon dwaara hastmaithun ke liye subjiyan yatha lambe vaale bangan, khiraa, gaajar, muuli, cakadi aadi apane jananaang main pravishtha karakar bhi santushti praapt kii jaati he
 Some teenage girls studying in school shake their vagina by putting a thick pen, candle or thick pencil
 is kriya se bhi unhen charmotkarsh kii prapti ho jaati he
 It has also been observed that some women achieve sexual pleasure only by rubbing their sexual organs on the side of the bed or from the side of a table
 jab stri-purush donon ek duusare ko yon sukh dene ke liye ek duusare kaa hastmaithun karte he to use angreji main naam diya gaya he-"onnism"
 Masturbation also affects the sexual stimulation of a person's genitals
 aamtaur par sambhog se purv stri-purushon main yah uttejnaa manuali praapt kii jaati he
 Mutual masturbation is also a common practice by using other types of objects or devices without physical contact, which a male partner does to his other female partner to achieve sexual satisfaction for longer
 angreji main ise "forple" kaha jaataa he
 Masturbation symptoms are also found in men and women with other techniques, but studies of masturbation with these methods have found that masturbation occurs more often in humans of both sexes and all ages
 yadhyapi vahaan bhinnata ho sakati he par apwaad nahin
 Masturbation has also been considered a healthy process to normalize sexual activity by providing psychological benefits through various medical methods
 sadiyon se chali aayi yah dharna aaj galat siddh ho chuki he ki hastmaithun se shaareerik aakshamata aati he balki aadhunik chikitsa shaastra main "pratidin ek ogatom hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye doctor ko dur rakhata he
 "like the revolutionary slogan has also been given for marathon health
 prostate granthi ek ang he jo veery ke liye taral padaarth kaa yogadan karata he, jaisaa ki prostate ko guda ke andar ungali daalkar mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 Even doing this sometimes brings joy; Hence, it is also a method of masturbation
 mutual hastmaithun sabhi yon jhukaav ke logon dwaara kiya jane vaala ek abhyaas he jo purush-ling ko stri-yoni main pravesh kiye bina ek vikalp ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It can also be helpful in adolescent girls to preserve their virginity or to prevent pregnancy
 kuch log ise aakasmik sex karne ke liye bhi ek vikalp ke rup main chunate hai, kyonki yah vaastavik sex ke bina hi yon-santushti detaa he
 For some young people, rubbing each other's sexes together with their friends helps sexual satisfaction
 kuch logon ko yah manovaigyanik prakriya unke apane ogatom ko viksit karne athwa apane sukh main vruddhi karne ke liye adhik samay tak hastmaithun karne ke liye prerit bhi karti he
 Mutual masturbation can be done by men or women in pairs or groups, or it can also be done by touching another person or without contact
 hastmaithun kii aavriti kai karkon, jaise yon tanaav, hormonal yon aadaton, sahakarmi ko prabhavit karne kii manovriti, uttam swasthya or parsparik yon-kriya samskruti ke anusaar kam yaa zyada ho sakati he
 For example, one does it once a day, some twice
 yah thik usee tarah jaise ki bhojan koi ek baar karata he to koi do baar
 Its relation depends on the physical and mental state of the person
 vibhinn adhyayanon main yah nishkarsh paaya gaya he ki hastmaithun maanviya praaniyon main aksar hota hi he
 1950 studies by Alfred Kinsey on the US population showed that 92% of males and 62% of females reported masturbation incidents during their lifetimes
 isi tarah ke parinaam 2007 main kiye gayi british rashtriya sambhavyata surveykshan main bhi paye gayi
 According to him, 73% of males and 37% of females surveyed between 95% of males and 71% of females in the age group of 16 to 44 years in the first four weeks during their interviews
 Bar reported masturbation, while another survey reported 53% of males and 18% of females reported masturbating once in the last seven days
 2009 main, britain sarkaar dwaara kishoravastha main kam se kam dainik hastmaithun karne ke liye protsaahit karne kii res main netherland or anya europea desh bhi shaamil ho gayi
 Everyday an orgasm was defined as an authority in their health instruction manual
 yah anya europea sangh ke sadsy deshon se data or anubhav ke jawaab main kiya gaya tha
 Doing so has been shown to be helpful in preventing unwanted pregnancy in teenagers, reducing sexual diseases and promoting healthy habits

 If the potential of this grid is gradually increased from a negative value, it will be seen that as soon as its value reaches the point at which the current starts flowing, the current starts flowing from very low to its absolute value
 
 jaise hi purna dhara pravaahit hone lagati he, niyatrank grid par dhara kaa kisi prakaar kaa prabhaav nahin rah jaataa
 After that no matter how much negative voltage is added to the grid, the flow of filler current cannot stop

 'bajirao mastaani' ek bhartiya aitihaasik romance film he jiskaa nirdesan or nirmaan sanjay lila bhansaali ne kiya he
 The film tells about Peshwa Bajirao of the Maratha Empire and his second wife Mastani
 ranvir singh or deepika padukon ne ye donon mukhya kirdaar nibhaae hai, priyanka chopra ne bajirao kii pehali patni kaa va tanvi aazmi ne bajirao kii maan kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 Bajirao Mastani is released on 18 December 2015
 bajirao mastaani film kii shuruyaat nae peshwa banane se shuru hoti he iske liye bajirao ko chunaa jaataa he iske baad is khushi main sabhi samrajya ke log khushi manaate hai
 Then suddenly Mastani from Bundelkhand comes to the aid and after fighting Bajirao's soldiers directly meets Bajirao and convinces him to take him to Bundelkhand where he fights with both the rivals and conquers there
 iske baad bajirao bundelkhand main holi manaate he isi bich bajirao or mastaani main pyaar ho jaataa he
 On the second day, Bajirao goes back to Pune
 isi bich jate vaqt bajirao mastaani ko apni kataar de ke jate hai is kaaran bundelkhand main kataar se vivaah ho jaataa he is parampara ke tahat mastaani pune jaati he
 There she meets Radhabai, Bajirao's mother
 radhabai mastaani ko nahin chaahati he is kaaran wo nafrat karne lagati he
 After this, Chimaji Appa shows Shaniwarwada and also shows amazing Ainamahal
 mastaani jab radhabai se rishte ko maanane liye kahati he to wo ghunghru dekar kahati he ki ab se tumhaara rishta ho gaya he ab se tum mehafil main naachogi
 Then Chhatrapati Sahu is invited from Satara, then Bajirao goes there, then Radhabai goes a new trick and sends Mastani by giving it to Gungroo but Mastani reaches there and puts Ghungroo in front of Gungru Chhatrapati Sahu, due to this, the Pant representative considered insult to the Mahfil
 But when Chhatrapati Sahu comes to know that she is the daughter of King Chhatrasal, he bites her to go back and says that you Or should he Mastani speaks that i should Baji is in love with Baji
 iske pashchaat mastaani bajirao kii pratiksha karti he us vaqt tufaan aa jaataa he or bajirao vahaan aakar mastaani se vivaah kar detaa he
 Meanwhile, Kashibai also comes to know and she also gets angry
 phir kashibai or mastaani ke putr hote he or unka namakaran kiya jaataa he
 Kashibai's son is named Raghunath while Mastani's son is named Samasher Bahadur
 isi bich bajirao or chimaji appa ke bich ladaai ho jaati he
 Bajirao tells everyone that he will bring Mastani to Shaniwarwada on Saptami day, but Krishnabhata and Radhabai tell them not to do it
 yah film suprasiddh marathi upanyaaskaar nagnath inaamdaar ke utkrisht aitihaasik upanyaas rau par aadhaarit he
 This novel is one of the successful historical novels not only in Marathi but also in the entire Indian languages
 isamen itihaas evam itihaas-ras donon kii raksha karte hue utkrisht sarjanaatmakataa kaa parichay diya gaya he
 There is naturally a lot of drama in this novel and while reading, it seems as if someone is watching a good serial
 iske varnanaatmak drishy bhi chalchitr ke drishyon kii tarah maanas-patal par ankit rah jate hai
 Being based on such a novel, a number of features have naturally come into the film
 sanjay lila bhansaali jaise siddhhast nirdeshak ke dwaara yah kahani or bhi chamak uthi he
 It is natural for the film to make some difference from the text, as the mediums of the two are different, but in this film some differences have been deliberately introduced in the form of film shots and shakes, which has shocked the perception of history
 aarambhik drishyon main bajirao ko peshwa niyukt karne vaala drishy to bahut hi uttam evam upyukt bhi he, or upanyaas se baahar kaa hote hue bhi aitihaasikta evam itihaas-bodh ke sarvatha anuroop he; parantu jis drishy main kashibai kii puraani saheli aati he, jiskaa pati peshwa bajirao ke kaaran maaraa gaya he or isliye vah apane pati kii raakh vahaan chhod kar ek tarah se shaap detii he, vahaan spasht antar aa gaya he
 In the novel, Kashibai has a dignified presence as a skilled housewife, while in the film, Kashibai is seen leaping towards a playful teenager, unraveling history
 filmkaar yah bhi bhul gaya he ki jis kashibai kaa vah aisa filmakan kar rahaa he uskaa betaa jawan ho rahaa he or vahi us utsav kaa mukhya karta-dharta tha
 Here, instead of Kashibai Peshwa's wife, the film heroine seems to be 'priyanka Chopra'
 chhatrasaal kii sahaayta ke liye bajirao ko mastaani ke dwaara sena sahit le janaa bhi bilkul anaitihaasik rup vaala ho gaya he
 Very interesting to see, but neither did it, nor could it happen by Mastani
 is prakaar ke chote-mote drishyon ko chhod bhi den tab bhi do akshamya bhoolen filmkaar ne kii hai-- shrimant bajirao peshwa or kashibai donon ko alag alag samay main nachvaa daalaa he
 In that era and in the Peshwa family, a woman like Kashibai, who was in a way a queen, would not have needed to keep dancers exclusively if she danced
 usamen bhi khaas baat yah he ki jis samay film main kashibai ko mastaani ke saath nachaaya gaya he, un dinon uske pair main baraabar rahane vaala dard or bhi badha hua tha
 Kashibai's meeting with Mastani has also turned out to be a different way and the film is shaky
 atah aitihaasikta ke saath rachanaatmak anand ke liye to ukt upanyaas hi padhanaa hoga, parantu mahan bajirao peshwa evam mastaani kii apurv premgautha evam durdharsh jivan ko maharashtra se baahar bhi jan-jan tak pahunchaane kaa kaary is film ne prabal rup se kiya he, iske liye filmkaar avashya dhanyavad ke paatr hai
 The acting of almost all the actors is also lively and admirable, which motivates the film to watch again and again
 varsh 2003 main sanjay lila bhansaali ne is film ke mukhya kirdaar ke liye salmaan khan or aishwarya raay ko chunaa tha
