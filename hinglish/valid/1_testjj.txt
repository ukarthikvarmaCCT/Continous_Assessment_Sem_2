 The ongoing liberation struggle between the influential Bengali people established in East Pakistan and the multi-caste Pakistanis settled in the four provinces of Pakistan sparked the indo-pakistani War

 At the same time religious and ethnic disputes also arose between Bengalis and multi-ethnic Pakistanis, as Bengalis were very different from those influential West Pakistanis
 :24–25 In the general elections held in 1970, the Awami League of East Pakistan got 167 seats out of the 169 seats in the East Pakistan Legislative Assembly resulting in an almost absolute majority in the 313-seat National Assembly, while West Pakistan's vote-bank Conservative Pakistan Muslim League And the Samajwadi Pakistan was divided into the People's Party, and the then-communist Awami National Party

 : 295 Major General Rao Farman Ali wrote in his daily diary: "we will make the green land of East Pakistan bleed

 On 27 March 1971, the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi gave full support of her government for the liberation struggle of East Pakistan and said that it is better to give refuge to millions of refugees in India than to fight against Pakistan and end this struggle

 The attitude of the Pakistani media was also becoming increasingly war-loving and militaristic against East Pakistan and India
 haalanki kuch pakistani media vidwaanon kii bhashaa in purv kii gatividhiyon kii riopirt dete hue, mili-juli bhi dikhaai detii thi
 By the end of September 1971, an organized publicity campaign had started, possibly with the support of the internal components of the Government of Pakistan, which resulted in stickers carrying messages like Crush India etc
 being put on the back of vehicles
 ye abhiyaan rawalpindi, islamabad evam lahore se armbh hote hue sheeghra hi puure pashchimi pakistan main failataa chalaa gaya

 By the end of April 1971, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had discussed with Indian Army Chief Sam Manekshaw about India's readiness to wage war with Pakistan
 sam manekshaw ke nijee abhilekhon ke anusaar unhone abhi is yuddh ke liye do karanein se asamarthta jataayi thi: ek to purvi pakistan kshetra main monsoon ke aane kaa samay tha, duusare sena ke tinkon kaa punaroddhar kaary pragati par tha

 In fact, Indira Gandhi was aware of the consequences of the hasty military action, but she also wanted to know the thoughts of her army, so that she could answer to many of her cabinet colleagues, and also pacify the mass community which India Were very important to support the decision to exercise restraint at that time

 In response to this, India started to build large-scale Indian army troops along its western borders, but they waited peacefully till December, so that after the monsoon rains, the land would dry up and help the expedition and snow in the Himalayan passes
 The movement should be blocked and there should not be any accessible route for China to enter the center

 At around 05:40 in the evening of 3 December, the Pakistan Air Force carried out unexpected pre-emptive strikes on 11 air force bases of northwestern India, including Agra, located 300 miles from the indo-pak border
 :82–83 is hamale ke samay vishwa-prasiddh tajmahal ko ghaas-phoos va pattiyon, belon va lataaon se dhank kar gande kapadon se gher diya gaya tha, kyonki uskaa shwet sangmarmar raatri kii chandani main shwet maardarshak ki bhaanti chamakta tha
 These pre-emptive attacks, also called Operation Genghis Khan, were inspired by Operation Focus's victory in Israel's arab-israeli six-day War, but a large number of Israeli fighters on Arab Air Force bases in that 1967 war
 Airplanes were dispatched, while Pakistan sent less than 50 aircraft
 :82 In the same evening, in a message to the nation, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said that these air strikes are a declaration of war on India from Pakistan and on the same night, the Indian Air Force also took the first counter-action
 agle din hi in javaabi hamalon ko vrahat str ke hawaii akraman main badal diya gaya
 With this, the indo-pak war of 1971 officially started and Indira Gandhi ordered the troops to march towards the border and started attacking Pakistan on a full scale
 :333 is abhiyaan main samanvay banaakar vaayu, sagar evam bhoomi se pakistan par sabhi morchon par hamale bol diye gaye
 : 333 The main objective of this campaign of India was to take control of Dhaka on the eastern front and to prevent Pakistan from entering the Indian land on the western front
 There was no Indian intention of conducting any major offensive into Pakistan to dismember it into different states
 Unlike the previous 1965 war, this time Pakistan was not ready for a naval encounter with India

 : 65 The Pakistani Navy was not in any position for aggressive war against the Indian Navy in the deep sea, nor was it able to provide adequate security against the sea encroachment of the Indian Navy
 :75–76 On the western front of the war, the Indian Navy's Western Naval Command led by Vice Admiral Surendra Nath Kohli made a surprise attack on the port of Karachi under the name Kootnam: Trishul on the night of 4 / 5 December 1971

 In return, Pakistani naval submarines, PNS Hangar, Mangro, and Shushuk, began a search for Indian warships

 : 85–87 On 9 December 1971, the hangar submerged INS Khukri, causing 194 Indian casualties; And this incident was the first submarine attack after World War II
 :229 Soon after INS Khukri's attack, another major attack on the Karachi port took place on the night of 8 / 9 December, codenamed: Python

 The Pakistani Air Force did not attack any Indian naval warship and they remained suspicious until the next day, due to which a civilian airliner, acting like Pakistan International Airlines reconnaissance war pilot, sent his own PNS Zulfikar in the confusion of the Indian vessel Attacked, causing severe damage to the vessel, as well as many working naval officers

 Pakistan has now taken a defensive stance after having lost its face in covert attacks and consequently loss in Indian attacks, as the war progressed, the Indian Air Force gave a tough fight to the Pakistani Air Force on every fronts
 And now attacks by Pakistan were decreasing day by day

 In psychology, unusual and inappropriate behavior for us is called psychosis
 ye dhire-dhire badhate jate hai
 There are many factors of psychosis, including heredity, weak personality, lack of tolerance, childhood experiences, stressful situations and inability to cope with them
 ve sthitiyaan, jinhen hal kar paanaa evam unka saamana karnaa kisi vyakti ko mushkil lagata he, unhen 'tanaav ke kaarak' kehete hai
 Stress imposes such requirements and demands on a person, which he considers extremely difficult and difficult to fulfill
 in maangon ko puraa karne main lagaataar asafalataa milane par vyakti main maansik tanaav paidaa hota he
 In today's time, stress has become a very common experience for people, which is expressed by a lot of physical and psychological reactions

 Hans Shale discovered the term 'stress' and defined it as an uncertain response based on any body requirement
 hens style kii paribhaasha kaa aadhaar daihik he or yah hormones kii kriyaaon ko adhik mahatv detii he, jo adrinal or anya granthiyon dwaara sravit hote hai
 Shale conceptualized two types of tensions - tanaav par naveen upaagam vyakti ko uplabdh samyoji sansadhano ke sambandh main sthiti ke moolyankan evam vyakhya kii bhoomika par kendrit he
 Interdependent processes of evaluation and adjustment determine the relationship between the environment of the individual and his adaptation

 When faced with stressful situations, the person usually adopts problem-focused or emotion-focused diplomacy
 samasya kendrit niti dwaara vyakti apane baudwik saadhaanon ke prayog se tanaavpurn sthitiyon kaa samaadhaan dhundta he or praayah ek prabhaavshaalee samaadhaan kii ore pahunchataa he
 When faced with stressful situations with an emotion-focused strategy, the person displays emotional behavior such as shouting

 Resistant-oriented behavior does not make it able to face the situation, it is only a means to justify its actions
 shaareerik samasyaayein jaise fever, khaansee, zukam ityadi ye vibhinn prakaar ke manovikar hote hai
 The list of psychologists in these classes ranges from minimal anxiety to severe psychosis such as dementia or fragmented mentality
 america manovikari sangh dwaara manovikaron par naidanik or sankhyikeey niyam pustak ) ko prakashit kiya gaya he jis main vividh prakaar ke maansik vikaron kaa ullekh kiya gaya he

 yadi koi vyakti bina kisi vishesh kaaran ke daraa hua, bhaybheet yaa chintaa mahasoos karata he to kaha ja saktaa he ki vah vyakti vyagrata vikaar se grast he
 There are different types of anxiety disorder in which anxiety is manifested in various forms
 inamen se kuch vikaar kisi cheez se atyant or tarkarahit dar ke kaaran hote hai or jununee-badhyakaari vikaar jahaan koi vyakti barbar ek hi baat sochataa rahata he or apni kriyaaon ko doharaata he
 Individuals who suffer from experiences of mood disorder have their moods restricted for a long period of time, those individuals settle on one emotion, or switch between these categories of emotions
 udhaaharan swaroop chaahe koi vyakti kuch dinon tak udhaas rahe yaa kisi ek din udhaas rahe or duusare hi din khush rahe, us ke vyavhaar kaa paristhiti se kuch sambandh na ho
 In this way there are two types of mood disorders dependent on the behavioral symptoms of the person - avsaad aisi maansik avasthaa he jo ki udaasi, ruchi kaa abhaav or pratidin kii kriyaaon main prasannataa kaa abhaav, ashaant nidra va neend ghat janaa, kam bhukh laganaa, vajan kam ho naa, yaa zyada bhukh laganaa va vajan badhanaa, aalas, doshi mahasoos karnaa, ayogyata, asahaayta, niraashaa, ekaagratha sthapit karne main pare shaani or apane va dusron ke prati nakraatmak vichaardhaara ke lakshanon ko darshaati he
 If such a person stays at such a price for a minimum of two weeks, he can be said to be depressive and it is necessary to provide him prompt clinical treatment for his treatment
 aaj ke samay main kuch bimaariyaan bahut hi saadhaaran ban chuki hai jaise nimna raktchaap, ucch raktchaap, madhumeh aadi
 Although they are all physical diseases, but they arise from psychological reasons like stress and anxiety
 atah manodaihik vikaar ve manovaigyanik samasyaayein hai jo shaareerik lakshan darshaatin hai, lekin iske kaaran manovaigyanik hote he
 At the same time, in the concept of psychosomatic, the meaning of mind is manas and somatic means body
 iske vipareet daihikroop vikaar, ve vikaar hai jinke lakshan shaareerik he parantu inke jaivik kaaran saamne nahin aate
 For example, if a person is complaining of stomachache but even when there is no problem of that particular part ie stomach
 kisi-kisi abhighataj ghatana ke baad vyakti apana pichhlaa astitv, gat ghatnaayen or aas-paas ke logon ko pahchaanane main asamarth ho jaataa he
 In clinical psychology, such problems are called dissociative disorders, in which a person's personality is separated from the social and society
 vighatnsheel smritilop, vighatnsheel manovikar kaa ek varg he, jisamen vyakti aamtaur par kisi tanaavpurn ghatana ke baad mahatvapurn vyaktigat soochna ko yaad karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 In the state of dissolution, a person realizes his new existence
 doosraa varg vighatnsheel pahchaan vikaar he jisamen vyakti apni yaaddaasht to kho hi detaa he vahiin naye astitv kii kalpana karne lagata he
 The other category is personality disorder, in which a person feels sudden changes or variably odd
 vyakti is prakaar mahasoos karata he jaise usne apane sharir ko tyaag diya ho yaa phir us kii gatividhiyaan achaanak se yantric yaa swapn ke jaisi ho jaati he
 However, the most serious situation of disintegration psychosis arises when there is a multiple personality psychosis and dissolution psychosis
 is sthiti main vividh vyaktitv ek hi vyakti main alag-alag samay par prakat hote hai
 You may have seen someone on the street in dirty clothes, eating unhygienic food lying around the garbage or interacting or behaving strangely

 We often call them insane, unconscious, but in clinical language they are called psychotic
 ye manovikar kii ek gambhir paristhiti hoti he, jo ashaant vichaaron, manobhaavon va vyavhaar se hote hai
 Dementia disorders include inconsistent mindset, faulty perception, obstruction of operative activities, monotonous and inappropriate expressions

 Peshwa Madhavrao was the fourth Plenipotentiary of the first Maratha Empire
 ve maratha samrajya ke mahanatam peshwa ke rup main maanya hai jinke alpavayask hone ke baavjood adbhut doordarshita evam sanghathan-kshamta ke kaaran panipat ke tritiy yuddh main maraathon kii khoyi shakti evam pratishtha kii punarprapti sambhav ho paayi
 In his short tenure of 11 years, even in the initial 2 years in the family life and in the last year in the pain of tuberculosis, he not only established good governance, but by uniting the worthy chieftains with his foresight and Nana Fadnavis and Mahadji Shinde Taking the cooperation of both, the Maratha Empire also reached supreme expansion
 madhavrao kaa janm peshwa balaji bajirao tathaa unki patni 'gopikabai' kii pratham santan ke rup main 16 farvari 1745 i0 ko hua tha
 He also had a younger brother, Narayanrao
 9 disambar 1753 ko 'madhavrao' kaa vivaah 'ramabai' naamak balika se hua
 'peshwa Balaji Bajirao' had decided before his death that despite being a minor after him, his elder son 'madhavrao' would sit on the throne of Peshwa and his uncle Raghunathrao would hold the charge on behalf of Peshwa till he reached adulthood
 isi nirnay ke anusaar peshwa balaji bajirao ke nidhan hone par shraadhkarya sampann ho jane ke baad madhavrao ko chhatrapati se milane ke liye satara le jaaya gaya
 On 20 July 1761, Madhavrao was given 'peshwa-pad' clothes by Chhatrapati
 satara se lautne ke baad raaghobaa ne alpavayask peshwa ke sangrakshak ke rup main shashan kii bagdor apane haathon main le lee
 Sakharam Bapu Diwan was appointed
 peshwa kii mata gopikabai mahan peshwa bajirao ke samay se hi peshwai ke vibhinn kaaryon tathaa sankaton ko bhi dekhati ai thi tathaa kaaphi anubhav praapt thi
 He did not like taking all the rights in his hand by Ragoba and he started worrying about the future of Peshwa
 unhone raaghobaa ke ekadhikaar kaa virodh karnaa aarambh kiya
 In this way, home discord started in the court of Poona
 saradaaron ke do paksh ban gayi
 One was a supporter of Gopikabai and the other was of Raghoba
 gopikabai ke samarthakon main pramukh the-- baburao fadanvis, triambkrav pethe, aanandarav raste, tathya ghodpade, gopal raav patavardhan, bhavanrav pratinidhi aadi
 Prominent among the supporters of Raghunathrao were Sakharam Bapu, Chinto Vitthal Rayarikar, Mahipatrao Chitnis, Krishnarao Parasnis, Aba Purandare, Vitthal Shivdev Vinchurkar, Naroshankar Rajbahadur etc
 anek pramukh logon sahit aam janata kii swaabhaavik sahanubhuti balak peshwa ke prati thi or isliye jab raaghobaa tathaa sakhaaraam baapu ko laga ki unka virodh lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he to unhone balak peshwa tathaa gopikabai ko vivash karne ke uddeshy se apane-apane padon se tyaag patr dene kii dhamkee dene lage
 He believed that Rajkarya would not be possible without him and then Gopikabai would be forced to bow down
 parantu gopikabai ne chaturaai kaa parichay dete hue in donon ko alag hi rakhte hue inke sthanon par baburao fadanvis tathaa triambkrav pethe ko niyukt kar dene kii baat kii
 Due to this, Ragoba became very angry and started provoking the Nizam against the Peshwa
 iske saath hi apni swayan kii sena bhi ekatra karne laga
 Despite being a minor, Madhavrao had a natural foresight and was prudent
 unhone raaghobaa ko samajhane or prasann karne kaa praytn kiya tathaa is baat ke liye bhi raji ho gayi ki bhavishya main unki salaah ke anusaar kaary karenge
 But, Raghoba himself wanted to occupy the Peshwa post, so he placed unreasonable demands
 is sandarbh main govind sakhaaraam saradesai ne likhaa he ki: Raghoba waged war with the help of his personal army and the Nizam, after his demands were not met by the demand of the Peshwa
 7 november 1762 isvi ko pune se 30 mile dur dakshin-purv main ghod nadi ke kinare yuddh hua, parantu nirnay na ho paaya
 The Peshwa moved the army from there to Alegaon on the banks of the Bhima River
 raaghobaa ne nizaam kii sena ke saath peechha karte hue vahaan pahunchakar 12 november ko achaanak peshwa par akraman kiya, jiske liye peshwa taiyaar na ho paye the
 As a result, he was defeated
 is grihayuddh ko lambey samay tak na chalane dene ke uttam uddeshy se peshwa ne swayan raaghobaa ke shivi main jaakar aatmasamarpan kar diya
 Raghoba showed from the top that he had no attachment to the position or power, but secretly kept the Peshwa and his mother under house arrest
 do hajaar sainikon ke ek rakshadal ko peshwa par kadi najar rakhane ke liye niyukt kar diya
 Similarly, Gopikabai was also kept under strict security in Shaniwarwada
 apni sthiti sudrudh karne ke liye raaghobaa ne samast anbhavi tathaa peshwa ke vishwasaneey karmchaariyon ko pad se hataakar apane logon ko behaal kar diya
 Many prominent chieftains went to the Nizam to avoid the reprisals of Ragoba
 pune main dinondin raaghobaa ke prati asantosh badhata hi chalaa gaya
 The Nizam deputed his brother Salavatjung and made the clever diplomatist Vitthal Sundar of his time his dewan
 vitthal sundar ne jab dekha ki panipat kii paraajay tathaa uske uparaant grihakalah ke kaaran maratha rajya nirbal ho gaya he to usne nizaam ko pune par akraman karne kaa suzav diya
 The Nizam wrote to the Peshwa that all the provinces east of the Bhima river and all its forts taken earlier from him should be handed over to him
 jin maratha saradaaron kii jaagir chin lee gayi he ve unhen lautaa di jaaen
 The person appointed by him should be made a diwan and all the affairs of the Peshwa court should be done with his advice
 nizaam ke dwaara is prakaar ke dussahaspurn tathaa apmanjanak kadam uthaaye jane kii baton se samast maratha saradaaron main jaagrukta kii lahar si daud gayi or is raashtra-sankat ke samay sabhi ekajute ho gayi
 Sakharam Bapu and other chieftains too, having been stricken with the atrocities of Raghoba, understood and recalled all the veteran chieftains who had gone to Hyderabad
 ab tak najarbandi main rah rahe peshwa madhavrao ne aise samay main apana apmaan bhulaakar apane vivek tathaa doordarshita kaa puraa parichay diya tathaa nizaam kaa saamana karne ko taiyaar ho gayi
 With a huge army, the Nizam marched towards Pune and the Maratha army along with the generals like Malharrao Holkar and Damaji Gaekwad also prepared
 haalaanki yah sena itani shaktishaalee na ho paayi thi ki khule maidan main nizaam kii sena kaa saamana kar sake
 So on one side the Nizam was heading towards Pune and on the other side the Peshwa along with Raghoba were heading towards Aurangabad
 donon ne donon ke pradeshon main bhayankar lutpaat kii
 People of Pune had to flee along with the prominent people of Pune
 nizaam kii sena ne pune ko lut liya
 Some prominent personalities of Pune including Nana Fadnavis took refuge in Lohgarh Fort
 gopikabai ko bhi narayanrav ke saath bhaagna padaa tathaa usne singhgarh main sharan lee
 Gradually all the Maratha chieftains of the Nizam started to get away from him and the power of the Peshwa started to prevail
 rakshasbhuvan naamak sthaan par donon senaaon main jabardast yuddh hua tathaa nizaam kii buree tarah paraajay hui
 His Diwan Vitthal Sundar was also killed in this war
 25 sitambar 1763 isvi ko sandhi hui or nizaam ko swaarthvash raaghobaa ne jitne pradesh de die the, ve sabhi pradesh nizaam ne peshwa ko samarpit kar diye
 This treaty is called the Treaty of Aurangabad
 madhavrao kii doordarshita tathaa parakram kaa is yuddh main puraa parichay mila tathaa maratha saradaaron main unki pratishtha kaaphi bad gayi
 The lost prestige of the Marathas was somewhat regained by this victory due to the defeat of Panipat
 do varshon se chal rahaa grih kalah ek prakaar se samaapt ho gaya tathaa peshwa purna shakti-sampann hokar shashan sanbhaalane lage
 Taking all the authority in his hand, the Peshwa again restored the worthy chieftains to the appropriate positions
 bhavanrav punah pratinidhi banaaye gayi
 Balaji Janardan Bhanu was appointed to the post of Fadnavis and Peshwa made good relations with all the chieftains
 mahadji scindia ko bhi unhone apana sahyogi bana liya
 At this time three new figures of new age emerged on the theater of Maratha state
 is sandarbh main saradesai ne likhaa he ki : After the defeat of the Marathas at Panipat, Hyder Ali in Mysore had a natural liberty to expand his influence
 vah mysore or karnataka par satta sthapit karne se bhi santusht nahin hua tathaa ek vishaal samrajya kaa shaasha hone kaa swapn dekhne laga
 He gathered a large army and started an attack on the Maratha kingdom
 peshwa madhavrao ne swayan maratha sena kaa netritv kar haidar ali par teen baar pratyakraman kiya
 In the third invasion which lasted from July 1770 to July 1772, he himself was present in the Peshwa campaign for the first 6 months, but due to becoming unwell, Trimbakrao Pethe returned to Pune himself as a general
 7 march 1771 ko moti talab ke yuddh main haidadli parajeet ho gaya
 The Peshwa's wish was to remove Hyder Ali from the throne and hand over the kingdom to the former Hindu king, but Raghoba did not allow this to happen with the objective of decreasing the authority of Peshwa: 'rakshasbhuvan' ke yuddh main vijay praapt karne ke baad se madhavrao dwaara saare adhikaar apane haath main le liye jane se raaghobaa vivash hokar chup to tha parantu vidroh kaa avasar lagaataar found rahaa tha
 He could not suppress his ambition to become a Peshwa and with the help of Bhonsle of Nagpur, he revolted against Madhavrao
 peshwa ke saamne bhi ab raaghobaa par akraman ke sivaa koi rasta nahin bachaa
 Finally, after defeating Raghoba, Madhavrao locked him up in Shaniwarwada so that he could not create a rebellion
 panipat main paraajay ke parinamswaroop uttar bharat main maratha rajya praayah nasht hi ho gaya tha
 The small rulers of places like Delhi, Agra, Doab, Bundelkhand, Malwa etc
 were engaged in trying to completely eliminate Maratha power
 madhavrao peshwa ne uttar bharat ke apane khoye hue rajya par punah satta sthapit karne kaa purajor praytn aarambh kiya
 In 1761 AD, Raja Madhav Singh of Jaipur was defeated by Malhar Rao Holkar, and the rage of the Marathas was re-established
 peshwa ne mahadji scindia ke mukhya naayakatv main tukojirao holkar tathaa ramchandra ganesh ke saath visaji krishna naamak do senanayakon ko bhi uttar bharat bheja
 Jat and Ruhels were suppressed due to Mahadji Shinde's prudence and powerful valor, the Nawab of Farrukhabad, Bangash and the rulers of Bundelkhand were defeated, Mahadji also liberated the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam, who was living in Allahabad under the protection of the British and After taking him to Delhi, he got him throne again
 dilli par punah maratha shakti kaa prabhutv kaayam hua or iske saath hi mahadji kaa yashosury bhi dig-digant main deepit ho uthaa
 Emperor Shah Alam gave Mahadji the title of Advocate a Muthalak in addition to many titles, whose authority was less than the emperor
 is prakaar peshwa madhavrao kii sooyeeboojh doordarshita tathaa sanghathan kshamta ke kaaran maratha samrajya apane sarvocch vistaar tak pahunch gaya
 The last 2 years of Peshwa Madhavrao, who had done big things in their short-term rule, were very painful
 unhen kshay rog ho gaya tha, jiske kaaran ve pidaa se tadapate hue shaiya par hi pade rahete the
 Sometimes the pain became so intense that they started asking their servants to put an end to it
 parantu itani pidaa jhelane ke baavjood unki samaj mand nahin padi thi tathaa ve antim samay tak maratha rajya ke ujjwal bhavishya ke liye chintit rahe
 He also freed Ragoba and called him to his younger brother Narayanrao and asked him to pledge to protect him
 raaghobaa ne vachan diya ki ve sadaa unki sahaayta tathaa raksha karenge
 Peshwa's Sadhvi wife Ramabai was husband Parayana and lived mostly near him in Peshwa's health
 peshwa kii badi ichha thi ki unhen ishtdev bhagavan ganesh ke charnon main mrityu praapt ho
 As per his wish he was taken to the temple of Theur
 vahiin se maheenon rajkaarya kaa bhi sanchaalan hote rahaa
