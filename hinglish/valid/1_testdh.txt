 diti ne kashyap ji se mithe vachanon se apane saath raman karne ke liye prarthana kiya
 On this, Kashyap ji said, "oh dear! i will definitely give you a bright son as per your wish

 Therefore, this time is not suitable for procreation

 is samay jo pishaachon jaisaa aacharan karte hai ve narkagami hote hai
 " pati ke is prakaar samajhane par bhi use kuch bhi samaj main na aayaa or us kamaatur diti ne nirlajj bhav se kashyap ji ke vastra pakad liye
 On this, Kashyap ji, assuming strong desire, greeted the divine and fulfilled the wish of Diti and after bathing with pure water, started chanting Gayatri as the eternal Brahman form
 diti ne garbh dhaaran kar ke kashyap ji se prarthana kii, "he aryaputra! bhagwaan bhootnath mere aparaadh ko kshamaa karen or meraa yah garbh nasht na karen
 His nature is very fierce
 kintu ve apane bhakton kii sadaa raksha karte hai
 They are my brothers-in-law, i greet them
 " When Kashyap retired from the evening, he saw his wife praying for the benefit of his children and trembling with awe, then he said, "oh Diti! You did not listen to me
 tumhaara chitt kaam vaasana main lipt tha
 You have enjoyed untimely tumhaare kokh se maha bhayankar amangalakaari do adham putr utpann honge
 The innocent people of the entire world will suffer from their atrocities
 dharm kaa naash karenge
 Will persecute saints and women
 unke paapon kaa gadaa bhar jane par bhagwaan kupit ho kar unka vadh karenge
 " diti ne kaha, "he bhagwan! meri bhi yahi ichha he ki mere putron kaa vadh bhagwaan ke haath se hi ho
 Do not be under the curse of a Brahmin, because through a curse of a Brahmin, a creature goes to hell and takes birth
 " tab kashyap ji bole, "he devi! tumhen apane karm kaa ati pashchaatap he is liye tumhaara naati bhagwaan kaa bahut bada bhakt hoga or tumhaare yash ko ujwal karegaa
 That child will serve the saints and conquer Kaal and become a councilor of God

 ek baar sanak, sanandan, sanathan or sanatkumar sampoorn lokon se virakt hokar chitt kii shaanti ke liye bhagwaan vishnu ke darshan karne hetu unke baikuntha lok main gayi
 Two gatekeepers named Jai and Vijay were guarded at the gate of Baikuntha
 jai or vijay ne in sanakadik rishiyon ko dwaar par hi roak liya or baikuntha lok ke bheetar jane se manaa karne lage
 On their refusal in this way, the Sankadik sages said, "oh fools! We are the ultimate devotees of Lord Vishnu
 hamaari gati kahin bhi nahin rukati he
 We want to see Devadhidev
 tum hamen unke darshanon se kyon rokte ho? tum log to bhagwaan kii seva main rahete ho, tumhen to unheen ke samaan samdarshi hona chaiye
 The nature of God is absolute peace, so should your nature
 hamen bhagwaan vishnu ke darshan ke liye jane do
 "even when the sages say this, Jai and Vijay stop them from entering Baikunth
 jai or vijay ke is prakaar rokane par sanakadik rishiyon ne cruddh hokar kaha, "bhagwaan vishnu ke sameep rahane ke baad bhi tum logon main ahankaar aa gaya he or ahamkaari kaa vaas baikuntha main nahin ho saktaa
 That is why we curse you that you go into sin and enjoy the consequences of your sin
 " unke is prakaar shaap dene par jai or vijay bhaybheet hokar unke charnon main gir pade or kshamaa maangane lage
 Knowing that the Sanakadik sages have come to meet Lord Vishnu himself, along with Lakshmi ji and all his councilors, came to welcome him
 bhagwaan vishnu ne unase kaha, "he munishwaron! ye jai or vijay naam ke mere parshad hai
 Both of them have taken offense by insulting you with arrogance and intellect
 aap log mere priy bhakt hai or inhone aapaki avagya karke meri bhi avagya kii he
 You have done a great job by cursing them
 in anucharon ne brahmanon kaa tiraskaar kiya he or use main apana hi tiraskaar maanata hoon
 i apologize on behalf of these councilors
 sevakon kaa aparaadh hone par bhi sansar swami kaa hi aparaadh maanata he
 Therefore, i wish you begging for happiness
 " The anger of the Sanakadik sages immediately calmed down with these sweet words of God
 bhagwaan kii is udaartaa se ve ati anandit huye or bole, "aap dharm kii maryaada rakhane ke liye hi brahmanon ko itnaa aadar dete hai
 Hey Nath! We have cursed these innocent councilors under the control of anger and we apologize for this
 aap uchit samajhen to in dwarapalon ko kshamaa karke hamaare shaap se mukt kar sakate hai
 " bhagwaan vishnu ne kaha, "he muniganon! mai sarvashaktimaan hone ke baad bhi brahmanon ke vachan ko asaty nahin karnaa chahta kyonki isse dharm kaa ulanghan hota he
 The curse that you have given is from my inspiration
 ye avashya hi is dand ke bhaagi hai
 They will go into the womb of Diti and get the monster's vagina and they will be killed by me
 ye mujhase shatrubhav rakhte huye bhi mere hi dhyaan main leen rahenge
 After i kill them, they will come back to this dham again
 " Jai and Vijay fall from Baikunth and fall into Diti's womb

 Lightning started falling

 Blood started flowing from the breasts of the cows

 Both demons rose to the sky as soon as they were born
 unka sharir faaulad ke samaan parvataakaar ho gaya
 He was wearing golden armor, helix, girdle, armlet etc
 hiranyakashyapu ne tap karke brahma ji ko prasann kar liya
 He took a boon from Brahma ji that his death should be neither in the day nor at night, neither inside the house nor outside
 is tarah se abhaya ho kar or teenon lokon par vijay praapt kar ke vah ek chhatra rajya karne laga
 His younger brother Hiranyaksha obeyed his orders and started destroying the enemies
 ek din ghoomte ghoomte vah varun kii puri main ja pahunchaa
 Upon reaching Hatalak, Hiranyaksha pleaded for war with Varun Dev and said, "O Varun Dev! You have conquered all the demons and demons of the world
 main aapse yuddh kii bhiksha maangata hoon
 You should prove your fighting skills by fighting with me
 us daitya kii baat sun kar varun dev ko krodh to bahut aayaa par samay ko dekhte huye unhone hanste huye kaha, "are bhai! ab ladane kaa chaav nahin rahaa he or tum jaise balashaali vir se ladane ke yogya ab ham rah bhi nahin gayi hai
 You should go to Yajnapurusha Narayan
 ve hi tumse ladane yogya hai
 Hearing the talk of Varun Dev, that monster went to Devarshi Narada and asked for Narayana's address
 devarshi naarad ne use bataaya ki narayan is samay varah kaa rup dhaaran kar prithvi ko rasaatal se nikaalane ke liye gayi hai
 Hiranyaksha reached the abyss on this
 vahaan usne bhagwaan varah ko apane dadh par rakh kar prithvi ko laate huye dekha
 That Mahabali monster said to the Varaha God, "hey wild animal! Where have you come from in the water? Stupid animal! Where are you taking this earth? Brahma ji has given it to us
 re adham! tu mere rahete is prithvi ko rasaatal se nahin le ja saktaa
 You are the enemy of demons and demons, so today i will kill you
 " Hearing these words of Hiranyaksha, Varaha God was very angry, but leaving the earth there, he did not think it appropriate to fight and he endured his bitter words and soon came out of the water like Gajraj
 unka peechha karte huye hiranyaksh bhi baahar aayaa or kehane laga, "re kaayar! tuje bhaagane main lajja nahin aati? aakar mujhase yuddh kar
 "putting the earth in the proper place on the water and providing its proper foundation, Lord Varah turned to the monster and said," Hey Gram Singh! We are wild animals and keep searching for village lions like you
 ab teri mrityu sir par naach rahi he
 "hearing these sarcastic words, Hiranyaksha pounced on him
 bhagwaan varah or hiranyaksh me madhya bhayankar yuddh hua or ant main hiranyaksh kaa bhagwaan varah ke haathon vadh ho gaya
 After the victory of Lord Varaha, all the gods including Brahma ji started praising them by pouring flowers from the sky
 brahma nen manu or satarupa kaa nirmaan kiya or sristi karne kii ajna di
 For this, land is required which the monster named Hiranyaksha slept in the ocean with a pillow to the earth goddess and kept the circle of worship for fear of the gods
 manu satarupa ko jal hi jal dikhaa jiske bare main brahma ko bataaya tab brahma ne sochaa ki sabhi dev to vishtha ke paas tak nahin jate, ek shookar hi he jo vishtha ke sameep ja saktaa he
 He meditated on Lord Vishnu and gave birth to Varaha Narayana from his nose, commanded to bring the earth up
 varah bhagwaan samudr main utre or hiranyaksh kaa sanhaar kar bhu devi ko mukt kiya

 The film starred Kunika, Manjeet Kullar, Aruna Irani, Anirudh Aggarwal and Afghani Adakar Hashmat Khan
 film kaa sangeet nirdesan anand-milind bandhuon ne sanjoya tha
 The film begins with ancient ruins located in the Kali Pahari, and the vampire human mongoose
 nevala, kukhyat drakula -kii tarah hi pishaach he, jo din main apni neend band tabut main puraa karata he, or raat main khooni chamagadad main badal pados gaanv main insaanon kaa akhet karata

 nevala ke paas kai shaitani sevakon kii ek mandali he jo uske liye maasoom logon kaa bandobast kar kaali pahari le chalata jahaan pishaach nevala aasaani se unka shikaar karata
 Mahua, Mahaguru, a tantric and many such mustard type of kidneys are present in his servant circle
 mahua naukaraani ke rup main bade hi nyaay parayan samajhe janevaale thakur pratap ke yahaan ghar par kaam karti
 One evening, Thakur sees him talking with Baku
 ye jaanate hue ki baku usee kaali pahari ke shaitanon kaa bashinda he, thakur fouran mahua ko dhamkee detaa he ki yadi vah dubaara us giroh se mili to use barkhaast kar degaa
 Despite this, Mahua follows the mongoose's intelligence orders as before
 vahiin thakur pratap behad dhan-sampada or sukhmay jivan ke baavjood, apni patni laajo kii koi santan nahin hone par udhaas rahete
 The priests of the local temple would have convinced her, but she would feel deeply inward when Thakur's aunt would come to her house and instruct her, asking her to remarry, citing the need of the dynasty
 vahiin mahua vachan dilaati he ki laajo ko santan prapti hogi yadi vah uske sang kaali pahari chale to, jahaan nevala uski muraad puri kar saktaa he, par kabhi aisi paristhiti bani ki yadi use betaa hua to vah use le ja sakati he or agar usne beti ko janma to vah nevala kii amaanat hogi or use vah saunpna hi padegaa
 Lajoie refuses at first, but Mahuja strongly admits that Lajoie accepts the deal
 parinamswaroop, laajo kaali pahari ko ravaanaa hoti he, jahaan use dudh se nahalaaya jaataa he or nevala prakat hokar use sammohit karata he
 At midnight, the mongoose makes a physical connection to Lajoie
 laajo puri tarah nevala ke vaseekaran main fasakar usase sambhog karne ko sahyog detii he
 Early in the morning, Lajo finds herself naked with a mongoose
 laajo haveli lautati he is baat se anbhigya ki nevala uski garbhvatee kar chukaa he or samay guzarate saath laajo ek bacchee ko janm detii he, kamya
 But when Mahua reminds her of the baby girl, Lajo falls into a state of almost zero and then walks away with her baby girl
 mahua apane maalik nevala ke nirdesh par vah vish laajo ko detii he
 Lajo then meets Thakur and narrates all the truth and tells him to save Kamya whom Mahua has taken to the Kali hill
 vahiin laajo lok-laaj ke bhay se vish khaakar mar jaati he
 Enraged, Thakur enters the Kali Pahadi and, follows a long duel, in which he cancels the mongoose's magical powers
 buree tarah jakhmi, nevala ladkadhaata hua apane tabut lautataa he or gupha kaa daravaaza band karata he or dubaara thik hone tak chirnidra main chalaa jaataa he
 After some twenty years, Kamya grows up as a beautiful young woman
 vah kumaar ko dil de baithti he, jo uskaa bachapan kaa pyaar he magar bachapan kii dillagi ke baavjood vah uski zyada parvaah nahin karti
 Kumar just wanted Sapna
 sapana mumbai sthit hostal main rahakar padhai kar rahi thi or aise hi roj uski ek aurat se bhent hoti he jo oos murdaani raat ko kaali pahari ke liye lift maangti he
 Sapna leaves him to the black hill but is unaware that he was left in a book car
 vah ek kaale jaadu-tone kii kitaab rahati he
 Sapna falls behind to return the book to the woman but she sees a woman there who is preparing to offer sacrifices to other priestly types
 yah drishy dekh sapana cheekh padati he
 Seeing the disruption in the sacrifice, the priest asks his men to get hold of him but he runs away and the book is also left in the black hill
 is vaakiye se ghabaraai sapana fouran kumaar ke ghar rukhsat hoti he or anand va use sabakuch bataa daalati he
 The next day these three leave the black hill, but they do not achieve anything as Sapna had said
 sapana kahati he ki vah neend main nahin thi or phir vah kitaab bhi mil jaati he jo pichhali raat usase chhut gai thi
 Then they go to meet Kamya who had invited these three to come on his birthday
 maamla tab dilachasp mode letaa he jab kumaar apane prem kii tasviir sapana ke saamne hi kamya ke janmdin par use uphaar detaa he
 Surprised by this, Kamya makes fun of Sapna causing Sapna to leave the place
 is bich kamya sidhe apane mudde par aati he, lekin kumaar use do took sunaakar chalaa jataahe
 Sapna, returning home, finds the same woman who was being sacrificed the previous night
 vah usase vahi kitaab maangti he or sapana kii car main baith jaati he
 Sapna reaches home and finds the book
 isi madhyahn, anand bich main hi party ko chhodkar gai sapana ko khojate hue uske ghar pahunchataa he
 Sapna tells about the unknown woman
 anand vah kitaab ghar se baahar phenk detaa he or yah sab soch ko band karne kahata he
 Kamya then goes to pick up the book where Kumar follows
 ghar pahunch kar vah kitaab padhanaa shuru karti he jisamen bataaya jaataa he ki jaadu-tone se kaise kumaar ko hasil kiya gaya
 While Kamya was giving a lift to the unknown woman, her car crashes, where the mongoose's gang men pick her up
 kamya ko uske jakhmon kaa ilaj us pujari ke kaale jaadu dwaara thik hota he or bataata he ki vah sabakuch paa sakati he yadi vah unke giroh main shaamil ho jaae to, vah maan jaati he
 Kamya practices witchcraft on Kumar in the cemetery
 vah vahaan pahunchataa he or usase pranay sambandh banaata he
 Anand and Sapna reach there and save Kumar
 anand ko us kabristaan main kumaar kii tasviren milti he or use yakeen pad jaataa he yah sari car-guzari kamya kii he jab usne kamya ko pehle bhi kaali pahari ke anjaan bashindon se milte dekha tha
 Every day Kamya is called on the nightly ritual on the Kali hill
 par darasal yah kamya ko phansakar nevala tak le jane kaa jaal tha jo barason kii neend se jaagaa tha
 He bites his bites to subdue Kamya and makes peace with him
 ab vah is band darvaaze ke peeche hameshaa ke liye kaid hoti he or nevala kii gulam banati he
 Kumar, Anand and Sapna all travel to Kali hill to save Kamya
 aakhirkaar ve use khoj lete hai, vah bamushkil se hosh main rahati he, vah kabron ke tahkhaane main rakhe shishe ke tabut main rahati he
 They try to save him that the place is filled with smoke and mongoose kidnaps him
 kamya ko vah tantric apane maalik nevala ke liye vasheebhoot karata he
 Now Kamya has to arrange more girls for her boss Mongoose
 vah bhanu ko apane jhaanse main phansakar kaali pahari le chalati he, lekin kumaar, anand or uske saathi tab tak bhanu ko nevala ke havas kaa shikaar banane se roak lete hai
 Kamya's next target becomes a dream
 sapana, bhi antat, ain vakt par batch jaati he, lekin kumaar or anand ko pataa chalata he ki kamya kisi anya ke vash main aakar aisa kar rahi he
 They tell all this news to Thakur, and decide that together they will end the Satan mongoose
 vahiin kaali pahari mapar kadam rakhte hi, thakur ko mahua se miltaa he, jo unhen suchit karti he ki shaitanon ne kamya ke janm par jaise jashn manaaya tha, or vahi kamya ab puri tarah nevala kii shaktiyon ke aage natmastak he
 In a fit of rage, Thakur beheads the mahua
 magar nevala ab ajey ho chukaa he
 He calls Bhanu again, and this time, he succeeds in stinging the sting
 nevala dubaara sapana par hamalaa karne ke liye, thakur ke ghar aa dhamkata he
 In a long haul, Mongoose now stands in front of Sapna after killing Bhanu and Anand, but at the last moment Thakur fails it
 or tab thakur, kamya ke janm rahasy ke bare main kumaar or sapana ko bataata he
 Then these three enter the black hill to find Kamya
 aakhirkaar ve use khoj lete hai, vah bamushkil se hosh main aati he, vah kabron ke tahkhaane main rakhe shishe ke tabut main rahati he
 But soon the mongoose itself jumps in with the gang members and other gangs stationed there to stop them
 in sabaki aapas main ladaai chhid jaati he or nevala ek baar phir ghayal hota he, magar use kisi bhi tarah maarna sambhav nahin hota
 That is when his evil servant and tantric escaped by loading the mongoose on the tang
 kumaar unka peechha karata he, or tantric ko daboch letaa he, tathaa use nevala kii kamajori ugalvaane ke liye jaan lene kii chetavanee detaa he
 The tantric then reveals that the soul of the mongoose is locked in the idol of Kali Pahadi and the sun's sun is its weakness
 kumaar or thakur ab donon raaston se nevala ko khatm karne kii chaal chalate he
 Kumar and Sapna lead the Tangay towards the Kali Pahadi, and with the help of the settlers intercept the mongoose
 nevala gusse se pagalaaya hua un sabpar hamalaa karata he
 Now he is able to reach the dream, he suddenly gets caught in pain and burns in shoals
 is tarah kumaar, sapana or thakur dwaara nevale kaa hameshaa ke liye nasht hote dekhne baad film samaapt hoti he
 The noted horror and author of the fourth installment of the science-fiction film, Donald C
 Willis, states in his comment "the excitement, lighting effects and the musical score composed like James Bernard - present in the film bring the screenplay to a repetition
" " " Web colors are colors that are used to design web pages
 web roopankan ke kartaaon ke paas bahut vikalp hote hai, in rangon ko web ghatakon kaa vivaran dene hetu
 These can be described as RGB triplets in a conspiracy form
 web rang ve rang hote hai, jo ki web panne roopankan hetu prayog hote hai
 Web design authors have a lot of options to describe these colors to web components
 inhen bataaya ja saktaa he jaise shaddashamalav roopakar main RGB triplate
 a conscript triplet is a six-digit, three-byte plot number, used in HTML to display colors
 teenon bite darshaati hai kisi ek rang ke laal, haraa, nila ghatak
 a byte is from 00 to FF, or 0 to 255
 This represents the least to the most intensity of each of the color components
 The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order: For example, consider the color where the red / green / blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 
 The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are 24, 68 and A0 respectively in hexadecimal notation
 To obtain the hex triplet, we simply write the three hex bytes together without spaces, thus: 2468A0
 If a byte is less than 10 or 16 it must be represented with a leading zero to keep the number of digits in the triplet equal to six
 For example, the decimal triplet 0,1,2 would be represented by the hex triplet 000102
 The number of colors that can be represented by this system is An abbreviated, three digit form is sometimes used
 Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC
 This allows each color value to cover its full range from 00 to FF
 Converting a decimal RGB value to a hexadecimal value is fairly straightforward
 Decimal RGB values are usually given in the 0-255 range; if they are in the 0-1 range, multiply the value by 255 before conversion
 This number divided by 16 gives us the first hexadecimal digit
 The remainder, times 16 again, gives us the second digit
 For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C
 a remainder of 9 gives us the hexadecimal number C9
 This process is repeated for each of the three color values
 Most modern operating systems have a built-in calculator to perform conversions between number bases and this can also be done with some hand-held calculators
 This task can also be carried out using various web resources
 The HTML 4
01 specification defines sixteen named colors, as follows : These 16 were also specified as srgb and included in the HTML 3
0 specification which noted "these colors were originally picked as being the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette
" In addition, a number of colors are defined by web browsers
 a particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005 all modern general-use browsers support the full list
 Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the x Window System
 These colors were standardized by SVG 1
0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents
 They are not part of SVG Tiny
 Almost the exact same color names are used in the 
NET Framework, in the knowncolor and Color enumerations
 The only color difference is darkseagreen which is defined as 8F, BC, 8B
 The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below, compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards
 Template: Color depthanother set of 216 color values is commonly considered to be the "web-safe" color palette, developed at a time when many computer displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors
 a set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six shades each of red, green, and blue
 The "web-safe" colors do not all have names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet
 Below are the values for the 6 shades of each color out of 256 possible color shades
 The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors, underlining the really-safe colors
 The lack of gamma correction means that the six desired intensities are 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%
 are displayed as 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, and 100% on a Windows standard 2
5 gamma CRT or LCD, making most colors very dark
 The intensities at the low end of the range, especially 0 and 3, are nearly indistinguishable from each other: Note that in the table below, each color code listed is a short-hand for the RGB value; for example, code 609 is equivalent to RGB code 660099
 The Cascading Style Sheets language defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 listed previously
additionally, CSS 2
1 adds the 'orange' color name to the list: CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2
1 also allow web authors to use so-called system colors, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system
 This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent
 As of early 2004, it appears that the CSS3 color module will once again drop these values, marking them deprecated, but this may change
 The developing CSS3 specification will also introduce HSL color space values to style sheets: dinu bhai pant dogri bhashaa ke vikhyath sahityakar hai

 The role of entrepreneurship and enterprise in economic and social development is often miscalculated
 saalon se yah spasht ho chukaa he ki udhyamshiltaa lagaataar aarthik vikaas main sahaayta pradaan karti he
 Transforming a thinking into an economic one is the most important thinking point under entrepreneurship

 Triangular survey is the name of the method in which the survey is easily done by dividing the given area for the survey as a mesh of triangular pieces
 iskaa siddhanth bahut saral he - gyaat duuri par sthit kinhin bhi do binduon se kisi tisare bindu dwaara banaaye gayi konon ko maapkar trikonmittiya sarvasamikaon kii sahaayta se us tisare bindu kii sahi sthiti nirdhaarit kii ja sakati he
 Its specialty is that it has to measure distance at a minimum and measurement of angles works
 konon kaa maapan adhik shuddhta se, kam samay me, kam shram se ho jaataa he
 Generally, where it is not possible to measure the direct distance between two distant points, but they are visible between themselves, a triangular survey is very useful
 yadi aise tribhuj kii ek, do yaa teenon bhujaaon par krmanugat tribhuj banaate chale jaaen or praarambhik tribhuj kii ek bhujaa, uske donon sheersh binduon ke niamak or banaae gaye sabhi tribhujon ke kone gyaat hon, to aisi sampurna tribhujamala kii bhujaaon kii lambaaiyaan or tribhuj banaanevaale binduon ke niamak or banaae gaye sabhi tribhujon ke kone gyaat hon, to aisi sampurna tribhujamala kii bhujaaon kii lambaaiyaan or tribhuj banaanevaale binduon ke niamak ganitiya kalan se gyaat kiye ja sakate hai
 In order to map any area, it is necessary to establish such points scattered evenly over the entire region
 aise binduon ko samuhik rup main surveykshan hetu 'niyantran dhaanchaa' or prayek bindu ko alag alag 'surveykshan stesan' kehete hai
 In the triangular survey, the help of trigonometric identities is used in the calculation, which has the following principal - trikoniya surveykshan ke uparyukt aadharbhat siddhantein ke anukool karyprakriya pradhanat: chaar bhaagon main bant jaati he : Selection of stations to make such a triangle, so that evenly scattered control points are available in the entire area for survey, ek aisi bhujaa praapt karnaa jisaki lambaai gyaat ho tathaa jis par praarambhik tribhuj banaaya jaay or uski bhujaaon par krmanugat tribhujon kii jaali buni ja se, Measure the horizontal and vertical angles on the triangles formed on the triangles drawn and binduon ke niamakon kaa kalan
 The first task is to select and mark the stations
 stesan bindu aise chune jate hai jo aath se assi kilametre tak ek duusare se dur hon ore sughatit tribhujamala banaaen
 There are three types of triangles in general
 ek bindu par milanevaale tribhuj, yaa tribhujon ke duusare siron par bane stesan, paraspar drushtigochar hon or aise sthal par bane hon jisase prayek tribhuj ke sheershabindu par konenaapane kaa yantra, theodolite, rakhkar kone padhe ja saken
 Angles are read from the same point and the same point, for the convenience, mark each station by digging a point on a stone
 bindu kii sthiti thik or sahi pahchaanane ke liye uske chaaron ore ek vrut bana diya jaataa he
 If such a stable stone is not naturally available at that site, then the stone is brought apart so that the surface of the circle and point is seen outside the surface of the earth, so that after any period the survey goes to that place
 Be able to identify the station
 bahudhaa suraksha kii drushti se surveykshak do pattharon par vrutt or centrebindu banaata he
 One is buried about one meter deep inside the earth and the other is placed on the surface of the earth such that the center of focus between the two circles fall on the same vertical line
 dur se dekhne kii suvidha ke liye steshnon ke aas paas kuch sanketachihn laga die jate hai
 In the area where the survey is to be done, if two points are available which are mutually visible and their regulators are known, then a third appropriate point can be selected and initial triangle can be drawn on it
 kisi bhi tribhujamala main aarambh karne ke liye ek bhujaa gyaat hona aavashyak he
 Such an arm is called a baseline
 aadhaar-rekha ke sire ke binduon ke niamak gyaat hon, to gananaa dwaara uski lambaai nikaali ja sakati he
 For example, if the regulatory points of those points are on the north-south line, line, respectively, and the east-west line, arm, then the length of the arm will be: us bhujaa kaa uttar disha se dakshinvarti kone This angle is required in calculating the regulators
 ise dinman kehete hai
 If two such points are not available, then the base is measured and established at the same time
 iske liye surveykshak aarambh karne vaale bindu ke aasapaas ek suvidhajanak samtal bhukhand par, yatharth maap denevaale feete se, ek rekha a aa naapta he
 These days, mainly, these feet hang the lace in the rope
 feete ke siron ke bich yatharth kshaitij duuri gananaa dwaara nikaal lee jaati he
 On it respectively, such triangles are formed that no angle of any triangle except the first one or two triangles is less than 20 degrees
 aadhaar bhujaa se aarambh karte samay do kone i or i 3 degree tak ke le liye jate hai
 But they are measured very accurately by frequency method
 yah kone theodolite naamak yantra se napate hai
 Starting at the base points, the angles are read by centering theodolite at all station points, respectively
 jaise jaise tribhujamala ke ek ek tribhuj yaa chaturbhuj ke saare kone puure ho jate hai, surveykshak jyamitiya sambandhon, jaise tribhuj ke teenon kone yaa chaturbhuj ke chaaron kone, kii jaanch karata jaataa he
 Due to the spherical surface of the Earth, when the triangle is very large, the sum of its angles exceeds 180 degrees
 is prakaar kii badhati ko goleey aadhiky kehete hai
 In a triangle of 75 square miles, this excess is 1 ""
 prekshan trutiyon or goleey aadhiky kaa shodhan karke gananaa main kone prayukt hote hai
 At the end of the observation, the lengths of all the sides are determined by the trigonometric formula using the base arm and the measured angles of the initial triangle
 taduparant niamak nikaalane ke liye gyaat bindu yaa binduon se agyaat bindu ko jodne vaali rekha yaa rekhaon ke dinman, jiskaa ullekh pehle ho chukaa he, nikaal liye jate hai
 The distance of the unknown point from the known point or points can be made known to the regulator and its pointer sine by knowing the value of the point
 ye ytaakar niamak kehalaate hai
 If the vertical angles also fall with the horizontal observation, then the height of the unknown point will not be high
 uparyukt samikarnon main u, pus or uu gyaat bindu kii kramash: uttarayan tathaa purvayan unchaaiyaan hai or da evam na kramash: agyaat bind kii duuri or natikon hai
 Geographical regulators of points, namely latitude and longitude, can also be derived by considering the Earth as a spheroid
 yadi trikoniya surveykshan aarambh karne ke liye keval ek bindu gyaat ho to duusare chune gaye stesan kii gyaat stesan kii gyaat stesan se duuri feete se aadharekha naapakar, prasaarit aadhaar jaal dwaara nikaalte hai
 Dinman is known from the astronomical observations of Dhruvatara and Surya etc
 yadi kisi kshetra main surveykshan pehali baar aarambh ho rahaa ho, jahaan kaai bhi bindu gyaat na ho to kuch din tak nirant khagoleey prekshan karke ek bindu ke niamak nirdhaarit karte hai
 Looking at the clear sky day by day during the night, it will be known that many recognizable bright stars are seen uniformly floating on the surface of a sphere
 unke udai or ast bhi niyamit rup se hote dekhe jaayenge
 Such spheres can also be imagined to be divided by the earth's post-meridian and parallels, which follow mathematical formulas

 Following are the details of some special glaciers - trogen horse yaa kaath kaa ghoda ek katha he jisamen greek sainikon ne traay nagar main pravesh karne ke liye kaath ke ek vishaal ghode kaa nirmaan kiya or dhokhe se try nagar main pravesh kiya
 The Trojan horse is a tale of the Trojan War, according to Virgil's Latin epic The Enid and Kuintus of Smyrna
 is katha main ghatit ghatnaaye kaansya yug se lee gayi he or yah homer kii odisi ke purv or iliad ke pashchaat likhi gayi thi
 It was only possible through the trick of the Greeks that they could finally enter the city of Troy and end the conflict
 According to a famous account, after 10 years of futile siege, the Greeks built a huge wooden horse and hid a specific contingent of 30 soldiers inside it
 unaniyon ne vahaan se nikal jane kaa naatak kiya or trogence ghode ko apni jeet kaa inaam maanakar shahar main khinch kar le gaye
 The same night a troop of the Greek army came out of the horse and opened the door to the rest of the Greek army, which had returned to the sheet of darkness
 unani sena ne troy shahar main pravesh kar usko nasht kar diya or yuddh ko jeet kar uskaa ant kar diya
 According to Greek tradition, in Homeric Ionic language the horse is called a lumbar horse and a "gift horse"
 lakshanik rup se koi bhi aisi chaal "trogen horse" kahi jane lagi jisase dushman ko kisi surakshit sthaan par aamantrit kar use lakshya banaaya ja sake
 These days it is also often linked to "virus-containing" computer programs and consumers are encouraged to install and run them as useful or harmless
 kuintus smirnius ke anusaar, lakdi ke ek vishaal ghode ke nirmaan, uske andar ek vishisht sena kii tukdi ko chhipaane or trogence ko murkh bana kar ghode ko apni jeet kaa pratik maanakar pahiyon par ludhakaakar shahar ke bheetar le jane kaa vichaar, orissius kii kalpana thi
 Under the leadership of Ipios, the Greeks built a wooden horse in three days
 orissius kii yojana ke anusaar ek aadmi ko ghode ke baahar rahanaa tha; jise unaniyon dwaara ghode ko trogence ke liye uphaar ke rup main or use peeche chhod diye jane kaa naatak karnaa tha
 Only one Greek soldier Sinon accepted to volunteer for this role
 virgil ne sinon or trogence ke bich hui vaastavik muthbhed kaa varnan kiya he: sinon ne safaltaapurvak trogence ko is baat ke liye manaa liya kii unani use peeche chhod kar ja chuke hai
 Sinon tells the Trojans that the horse is an offering by the Greeks to compensate Goddess Athena for the sin of desecrating their temple of Troy, and to ensure their safe journey home

 At the time of Sinon's interrogation, the Trojan priest Loukoon gets the idea of the plot and warns the Trojans, these lines written by Virgil are famous "timeo Danos et dona ferentes"
 Before any Trojan could believe his warning, Lord Poseidon sent two sea serpents to strangle him and his sons Antiphantes and Thimbreys

 The Trojan horse, according to modern imagination, would be a wall-breaking plank somewhat resembling a horse, and details of its use were legendarily altered by oral historians who were not present in the war and were unaware of the meaning of its name
 
 us samay asirian log gheraabandi vaale sanghathanon ke liye jaanwaron ke naam istemaal karte the; to yah sambhav he ki trogen horse bhi aisa hi kuch ho
 It is also believed that the Trojan horse is in fact a form of an earthquake that came between battles, which weakened the walls of Troy and left them open for attack; The deity Poseidas performed the tripartite function as the god of the sea, horses and earthquakes

 The enemy may have disguised themselves as this cavalry troop and had been taken into Troy without any interrogation
 This interpretation of the Trojan horse is used by author David Gemmell in the third part of Troy's drama

 The primary coil has much shorter wraps than the secondary
 yah kundali switch dwaara ek bydaree se yojit hoti he
 This switch is of contact and break type, with a spring

 The head of the contactor is made of platinum metal, so that the contact does not occur even if the arch is formed repeatedly

 a field is generated by the current flowing through it

 When the area of the primary coil increases significantly, the soft iron contactor of the switch is attracted to the core coil
 crode bhi narm lohe ke bana hota he
 Due to the contact's pull to the core, its contact is broken by a static contact; And thus the circuit of the primary coil current is not complete
 aisa hone se usamen pravaahit hone se usamen pravaahit honevaali dhara bhi ruk jaati he
 Actually the current does not become absolutely zero, but due to the inductance of the horoscope, there is a delay of some time in it

 But when this happens, the soft iron contactor is also thrown back to its old position as the core's charm is gone
 isse vah phir sthir sansparshak se sansparsh karne lagata he
 In this way, the circuit of the primary coil current is completed again and the current from the battery starts flowing again

 As a result, the circuit of the primary coil current is repeatedly formed and broken

 In fact, the value of current in the secondary is very small

 While the film was also criticized, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times described it as "an incomplete, messy and sometimes trying film with moments of pure sweetness and humor sprinkled between saccharine and melancholy
" " The film had no effect on Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, who awarded the film one of five stars and remarked, "the heartless emotional disgust and silly stereotypes in this outlandish badass comedy gave me a boiling look at the film Forced to criticize the equivalent of a hot nose, "while Philip French of The Observer stated," any such feature featuring indemnity Z's presence as Wilson that terrible poker dramatic artist Alan editor of a comedian named Arkin can double-take without my head moving

 In biotechnology, modeling is the process of replicating DNA segments, cells or organisms
 yah shabd kisi utpaada, jaise digital madhyam yaa software kii anek pratiyaan nirmit karne kii prakriya ko bhi suchit karata he
 The word clone is derived from Œ∫ŒªœéŒΩ, a Greek word for "stem, branch", denoting the process by which a new plant can be produced from a branch
 udhyaniki main beesvin sadi tak clon vartanee kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha; antim e kaa prayog yah bataane ke liye shuru hua ki yah swar ek "sankshipt o" nahin, valki ek "deergh o" he
 Since the word entered the popular dictionary with a more general reference, the spelling clone is used uniquely
 anvik pratirupan ek paribhaashit diene kram kii anek pratilipiyaan banane kii prakriya ko sanderbhit karata he
 Modeling is often used to amplify entire dna-containing DNA fragments, but can be used to amplify any DNA sequence, such as promoter, non-coding sequence, and randomly fragmented DNA
 genetic fingerprinting se lekar bade paimaane par protein ke utpaadan tak, jaivik prayogon va vyaavhaarik anuprayogon kii ek vyapak shrinkhalaa main iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes the term impersonation is misleading to describe the chromosomal status of a gene associated with a specific phenotype, as in positional modeling

 However, a number of other features are required and a variety of specialized modeling vectors are available, allowing for the expression of protein expression, tagging, single-stranded RNA and DNA production, and other modifications
 kisi diene khand ke pratirupan main aavashyak rup se chaar charan sammilit hote hai Although these steps are similar in different modeling methods, several alternative routes can be selected, summarized as "impersonation strategies"
 prarambh main, hamaari ruchi ke diene ko alag karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki upyukt aakaar kaa diene khand pradaan kiya ja sake
 iske baad, baandhne kii vidhi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jisamen is pravardhit khand ko ek vector main pravisht kiya jaataa he
 This vector is straightened using a restriction enzyme and incubated under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase with our segment of interest
 baandhne ke baad, hamaari ruchi kii pravishti se yukt vector ko koshikaon main transfect kiya jaataa he
 Several alternative techniques, such as chemical sensitization, electroporation, optical injection and biolistics of cells, are available
 ant main, transfect kii gai in koshikaon ko pravardhit kiya jaataa he
 As the efficiency of the methods described above is typically low, it is necessary to identify cells that have been successfully transfected with a vector construct with the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation
 aadhunik pratirupan vectors main chayan-yogya pratijaivik pratirodh chinhak shaamil hote hai, jo keval un koshikaon ke parivardhan kii anumati dete hai, jinamein vector transfect kiya ja chukaa ho
 iske atirikt, pratirupan vectors main rang-chayan chinhak bhi ho sakate hai, jo X-gal madhyam par neeli / safed screening pradaan karte hai
 However, selection of these steps does not fully guarantee that DNA entry is present in the cells obtained

 However, in the case of additions derived from multicellular organisms, impersonating cells is a difficult task as these cells will not grow easily in standard medium
 koshika-panktiyon kii ek bhinn vanshavali ke pratirupan ke liye prayukt ek upyogi utak sanvardhan takanic main pratirupan chakron kaa prayog shaamil hota he
 According to this technique, single-cell delay of cells exposed by a mutagenic medium or drug used to conduct selection is maintained at high dilution to form isolated settlements; Each of which originates from a single and possibly clone-form distinct cell

 Its most likely purpose is to produce embryos for use in stem cell research
 is prakriya ko "anusandhan pratirupan" yaa "upachaaratmak pratirupan" kehete hai
 Its goal is not to create replicated humans, but to create stem cells that can be used to study human development and to treat potential diseases
 While the replicate human blastocyst has been constructed, the original cell lines have yet to be isolated from the replication source

 In short, this form of modeling is an asexual method of reproduction, with no fertilization or endogenous contact
 Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring method found in many species, including most flora and some pests
 vaigyanikon ne pratirupan ke saath kuch badi uplabdhiyaan hasil kii hai, jinamein bhedon or gaayon kaa alangik prajnan shaamil he
 There is a lot of ethical debate on whether impersonation should be used
 Although impersonation, or asexual reproduction, has been practiced in the horticultural world for hundreds of years

 In species using the XY system of sex determination, the offspring will always be female
 An example of this is the "small red ant", originally native to Central and South America, but has spread to most equatorial environments
 jeevon ke kritrim pratirupan ko prajananeey pratirupan bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Reproducible modeling usually uses "somatic cell nuclear transfer" to create genetically integrated animals
 is prakriya main ek daata vayask koshika se kisi nabhik-viheen ande main nabhik kaa sthanantaran karnaa shaamil hota he
 If the egg divides normally, it is transferred to the uterus of the representative mother
 is prakaar ke praturup purnatah samroop nahin hote kyonki daihik koshika ke nabhik diene main kuch parivartan ho sakate hai
 Additionally, mitochondria in the cytoplasm may also contain DNA, and during SCNT, this DNA is derived entirely from the donor egg, so its mitochondrial genome is not identical to the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced
 yah antahprajateey nabhik sthanantaran ke liye mahatvapurn prabhaav lagu kar saktaa he, jisamen nabhik-mitocondrial asangattaaon ke parinamswaroop maut ho sakati he
 Artificial embryo division or method of making pairs of embryos can also be used as a method of modeling, in which mature embryos are divided before embryo transfer

 Breeding modeling will involve the creation of replicated humans
 a third type of modeling, called substitution modeling, is a theoretical possibility and will be a combination of therapeutic and reproducible modeling
 Replacement modeling would involve replacement of a highly damaged, failed or weak body by impersonation, followed by a full or partial brain transplant
