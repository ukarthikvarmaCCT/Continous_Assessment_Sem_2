 Edited by xxrep 18 - VICKY KUMAR NIRALA According to the Linga Purana, the demon Hiranyaksha, by performing the severe penance of God Shiva as Kalagni Rudra, asked him for the boon of a son like Shiv Shankar
 bhagwaan shankar ne vardaan swarup hiranyaksh ke ghar andhakasur ke rup me janm liya
 Andhakasura was an ardent devotee of Shiva since childhood
 andhakasur ne bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya kar unase se 2000 haath, 2000 paanv, 2000 ankhen, 1000 siron vaala vikaraal swarup praapt kiya
 After being slaughtered by the Varaha avatar of Lord Vishnu of his father Hiranyaksha, Aahat Andhakasura began to consider Lord Shankar and Vishnu as his ultimate enemies
 andhakasur ne brahmadev kii tapasya kar unase devataaon dwaara na maare jane kaa var praapt kar liya
 Andhakasura conquered Indralok by consuming Triloki and he began to torment Indra
 padmapurana anusaar raahu-ketu ko chhodkar andhakasur ekmaatr aisa daitya tha jisane amritpan kar liya tha
 This monster had become so blind due to its power and ghastly nature that no one could see it before him
 isi ahm kii andhta ke kaaran andhakasur mata parvati par bhi mohit ho gaya tathaa parvati ko praapt karne kaa ytn bhi karne laga tathaa isi prayaas me andhakasur ne parvati rup dhaaran karke bhagwaan shankar se chal kar unka vadh karne kaa bhi prayaas kiya or usne bhagwaan shankar ke sir par apni gada se prahaar kar diya tha
 Taking the form of Shiva, Andhakasura also killed Mother Parvati
 naa chaahakar bhi bhagwaan shankar ko apane hi ansh andhakasur se parvati ke chudaane or dharm kii raksha karne ke liye yuddh karnaa padaa
 According to the scriptures, Andhakasura defeated Lord Vishnu in an outbreak of war in Dewasur war
 is par bhagwaan shankar ne yuddh kar andhakasur ko parrast kar use apane trishul par lataka diya
 Thousands of Andhapakura's eyes and limbs were falling from the sky to the earth
 bhayankar yuddh me bhagwaan shankar ke lalaat se gire paseene se ek vikaraal rupadhari kaa janm hua jisane prithvi par gire andhakasur ke gire rakt va angon ko khaanaa shuru kar diya andhakasur kaa rakt va ang khaakar hi wo swayan andhakasur jaisaa ban gaya parantu jab vadh uparaant bhi andhakasur ke vikaraal rup kii bhukh shant nahi hui tab vah bhagwaan shankar ke sammukh atyant ghor tapasya main sanlagn ho gaya
 Then Bhole Bhandari, satisfied with his penance, expressed his desire to grant him a boon
 tab us vikaraal praani ne shivashankar se teenon lokon ko gras lene kaa vardaan praapt kiya
 The huge body of Andhakasura as a boon had now taken the shape of an object
 va vikaraal vastu akaash ko avaruddh karata hui prithvi par aa giri
 Then the terrified gods and Brahma Shiva were pillaged by the demons and demons
 use vahiin par aundhe munh giraakar sabhi devtaa us par virajman ho gaye
 In this way, because of all the gods residing on him, that object became known as Vikral Purush Vastupurusha
 tab us dabe hue vastu rup vikaraal purush ne devataaon se nivedan kar vardaan praapt kiya
 The Gods of Brahma gave him a boon by naming him as Vastu Purush
 vardaan anusaar yajna me vishvadev ke liye ant me di gayi aahuti hi vaastupurush kaa aahaar hoga
 And Vastu Man will have the right over the sacrifice made in Vastu Shanti and Yagyotsava and Vastupurusha will remain in everything
 nirmaan se jude yajna me vaastupurush hi vidhman honge tathaa tabhi se jivan main shanti ke liye vaastu puja kaa aarambh hua
 Similarly, Lord Shivshankar gave birth to architectural science with the slaughter of Anshvatara Andhakasura

 sabase prabhavi adhiprachaar vah hota he jisaki saamagree praayah purnatah satya hoti he kintu usamen thodi maatra asaty, ardhsaty yaa taarkik dosha se purna kathan kii bhi ho
 There are many methods of propaganda
 dushprachaar kaa uddeshy soochna dene ke bajaay logon ke vyavhaar or raay ko prabhavit karnaa hota he
 Propaganda literally means propaganda, propaganda or propaganda in Hindi
 propaganda kisi vishesh uddeshy se, vishesh taur se raajnneetik uddeshy ke tahat, kisi vichaar or najariye ko failaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 But its foundation usually does not depend on truth
 propaganda kii shuruyaat yuddh ke dauraan dushman kii sena ko naitik rup se parajeet karne ke liye ek afawaah ke rup main hui thi
 Then it is mentioned that in 1622, the fifteenth Pope Gregory took over the propaganda work against the Protestant Reforms in the Vatican
 propaganda kii chhavi nakaaratmak us samay bani jab pratham vishwayuddh ke dauraan british sarkaar ne apane raajnneetik hiton ke patr main vyavasthit rup se propaganda kiya
 Later, it was also used for campaigning
 prarambh main ise raajnneetik partiyon ke chunaav-prachaar ke dauraan pratyaashee ke hit main samarthan khinchne ke liye istemaal hota tha
 Subsequently, considering its usefulness, it expanded and became a part of advertising
 vigyaapan ke saath judane par propaganda main sakaaratmak paksh bhi aayaa
 He began to play the role of the bearer of a pleasant feeling that touched emotions and became creative in a particular context
 propaganda dwaara uplabdh karaayi gayi soochna kaa aadhaar aitihaasik rup se sakaaratmak na hokar hameshaa se hi nakaaratmak rahaa he
 The information given through it is often one-sided and misleading in nature
 propaganda kaa upyog raajnneetik kaarnon se kisi drushtikon-vishesh ko badhaava dene ke liye shuru kiya gaya tha
 Today the pane of propaganda has become very widespread and it is deliberately being used to spread negative information about a person, institution, nation, product or any political party
 propaganda kaa doosraa paksh yah he ki ise ek vishesh prakaar ke sandesh ke rup main bhi dekha jaataa he
 In the form of a message that is propagated through a slogan etc
 to propagate a particular culture, philosophy, idea or opinion in the market and society
 yuddh ke dauraan jhooth ko sach sabit karne ke liye propaganda kaa upyog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 America is considered the largest user of this propaganda
 vah yuddh ke dauraan hameshaa aisi khabar failaata he ki vah maanavtaa kii raksha or aatankwaad se ladane ke liye yuddh kar rahaa he, jabaki uskaa makasad kuch or hota he
 The biggest example of this is seen in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan in the last two decades
 america hameshaa yah bataata rahaa ki aatankwaad se ladane ke liye aisa karnaa zaruri tha jabaki sachai yah thi ki vah apane sainikon ke saath-saath aise patrakaron kii fuj bhi lekar chal rahaa tha jo uske paksh ke the yaa jinhen kareed liya gaya tha
 These journalists kept broadcasting information which was not true in the name of showing their news live
 aisi patrakarita ko hi jadit patrakarita yaa imbadid jarnalizam kaha jaataa he
 In such journalism, reporting is done as per the wishes of one party and the truth is lost
 kai baar is is patrakarita kaa upyog raajnneetik partiyon dwaara apane paksh main janamat banane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Some communicators believe that propaganda originated after the development of mass media
 ve ise sanchaar ke hisse ke rup main dekh kar maanate hai ki janamat ko apni taraf aakarshith karne ke liye kiya jane vaala sanchaar propaganda kaa ek prakaar he
 Here it is necessary to consider the relation of communication and propaganda
 ikkisvin sadi ke praarambhik daur main radio ke avishkaar ne propaganda ko ek vishesh oochaal diya
 Through the radio, your talk can be reached to a wider audience in a very short time
 radio ke vikaas ne swayan-prerit or pryojit soochna ko failaane kaa hi kaam nahin kiya, varan isane us vigyaapan kaa bhi sutarapaatr kiya jiske viksit rup aaj vibhinn roopon main hamaare saamne hai
 In such a short time before the development of radio, it was impossible to reach directly to a wider audience
 yah zarur he ki print madhyam dwaara bhi sidhe taur par soochna kaa sampreshan kiya ja saktaa tha, lekin samachar patron ke pathak kam hi the
 The condition of literacy was also associated with becoming a reader
 radio ne vigyaapan ke ek naveen sansar kaa anaavaran kiya jahaan padhane kii yogyata hona zaruri nahin tha
 This made the reach and influence of advertising unlimited
 vigyaapan ke saath-saath raajnneetik propaganda kaa bhi vistaar bahut teji se hua
 The arrival of TV to Propaganda after radio gave another new boom
 tivi ne radio ko apdasth to nahin kar paaya, lekin radio ke mukaable isaki vishwasaneeyata logon ko zyaada pramanik nazar aayi
 When big companies introduced their products exaggeratedly, people started seeing their image in that promotion
 isiilie vigyaapan guru alek padmasi ne ek baar kaha tha ki bharat ke log jab kisi vastu ke graahak banate hai to vah tark se kam or bhaavana se zyaada banate hai
 He cites the example of Liril soap and said, 'what do you think this girl who is wearing a bikini bathing in a waterfall and feels refreshed like the smell of lemon smell, is it really possible in the villages and cities of real India The Where a bucket of water would have been destined to be bathed in a manner, how could it feel like the smell of lemon? On this basis, Padmasi says that through propaganda, advertising creates an image in front of the consumer in which consumers start seeing their image
 haal hi ke varshon main internet or i-mail ke avishkaar ne propaganda ko vaishvik vistaar diya
 Web-mediums, for example, have the power to make a local issue a global issue
 bhugolinta kii sari simaaon kaa web-madhyamon ne ulanghan karke sampoorn duniya ko ek chote se gaanv main tabdeel kar diya he
 In a moment, people have taken advantage of the Internet system to go from local to global
 ek sthaneey gayak or local sangeet kaise kuch samay main hi internet ke madhyam se sabase lokapriy sangeet ban jaataa he iskaa sabase shashakt udhaaharan he kolaberi di naamak geet
 In the language of marketing, what we know as viral marketing is actually propaganda in the language of media
 ek taraf to propegande ko nakaaratmak baat sakaaratmak dhang se pesh karne vaala madhyam kii tarah dekha jaataa he or duusari taraf propaganda prachaar kaa ek aisa hunar bhi he jisamen kisi vishay-vastu ko kuch is tareeke se pesh kiya jaataa he ki uski taraf log aakarshith ho jaaen
 The related subject should be presented through a language, rhythm and music that the common consumer feels connected to and associates with the product
 iske liye media ke vibhinya madhyamon kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 Such as: television, radio, banner, internet, billboard, leaflet, etc
 bhaawanaaon ko sparsh dene kii is bhoomika main nakaaratmak paksh sirf itnaa hi he ki aisa propaganda manushya kii taarkikta kaa sanhaar karke uski jagah par bhaavnaatmak paksh ko zyaada prabhavi bana detaa he
 Tristian Tolliver, an American advertising writer, has said about Propaganda: i always think of myself that people don't like what you did and did for them
 balki aapako hameshaa isliye yaad kiya jaataa he ki aapane apni baton ke madhyam se unhen kya mahasoos karaayaa
 For example, in Propaganda, it does not matter much how well you put something, but the most important thing is that the feeling and inspiration that comes out of it leaves a mark on people
 propaganda ke sukhad ehsaas main lambe samay tak yaad rakhe jane kii kshamta hoti he
 In this context, the use of propaganda in advertising has started giving it a positive form rather than just being negative
 is pahalu ke mutabik propaganda rachanaatmak prakruti kii avadharana par aadhaarit ek sampoorn prakriya kaa naam he
 How it is to be used - depends entirely on the user

 Sri Krishna Bhatt Kavikalanidhi, a contemporary of Sawai Jai Singh, hailed from the courts of Bundi and Jaipur, was a great poet of andhra-tailang-bhatt, Sanskrit and Braj Bhasha
 "savai jaisingh dwitiya ne apane samay main jin vidwatpariwaron ko baahar se laa kar apane rajya main jaagir tathaa sangrakshan diya unamem andhra pradesh se aayaa yah tailang brahman parivaar pramukh sthaan rakhata he
 Kavikalanidhi Srikrishnabhatta was born in this family, who made the state proud by composing many texts like 'ishwar Vilas', 'padyamuktavali', 'raghav Geet' etc
 inhone savai jaisingh se sammaan praapt kiya tha, ashwamedh yajna main bhaag liya tha, jaipur ko basate hue dekha tha or uskaa ek aitihaasik mahakavy main varnan kiya tha
 This erudite scholar of devarshi-kul had gained enough fame, prosperity and honor during his life time due to his talent
 " Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri recalled his ancestor Kavikalanidhi in Soratha verses in the Sanskrit verse, in these words - Tulsi-sur-vihari-krishnabhatta-bharvi-mukhah

 " Bhattji's family Reinva Naresh, also known as 'bandhav-naresh', lived for a few years under the umbrella and from there Bundi Rajasthan settled because Raja of Bundi was also a virtue of Vaidusya

 The king asked him to bring this book within two months
 shrikrishna bhatta ji yah jaanate the ki vastav main aisi koi pustak kahin thi hi nahin, jab ki unhone aisi pustak ke kaashi main hone kii baat kah di thi
 He himself started writing poetry on Rama-rasa and within two months he prepared a book called 'ramarasa' in Brajbhasha which was equivalent to Ramayana

 isse sadasyon ke vaartalap or kaary main sahajata aati he
 Under linguistics, semantics or 'semantics' is a method related to the meaning of words
 bhashaa ke daayre main shabdon or vaakyon ke taatpary kaa adhyayan arth-vigyaan kehalaata he
 Economics was not recognized as a separate discipline before the late nineteenth century
 francisi bhashaa-shastri mishael bril ne is anushaasan kii sthapana kii or ise 'cementics' kaa naam diya
 After the linguistic revolution in the early twentieth century promoted by Ferdinand the Sasseur, the feet of cementics began to accumulate in sociology
 cementics kaa pehla kaam he bhashaai shreniyon kii pahchaan karnaa or unhen upyukt shabdaawalee main vyakhyayit karnaa
 Earth-to-top but intricate from within cannot be without the help of cementics
 udhaaharan ke liye ‘nashwar hote hai log’ or ‘nashwar the gandhi’ ke bich arth-grahan ke antar par drushti daal kar cementics kii upyogita kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The implication of the second sentence is that Gandhi was considered immortal or that people like Gandhi are also mortal
 cementics yah pataa lagaataa he ki arth-grahan kaa yah antar paidaa karne main bhashaa kaise kaam karti he
 The strange thing is that initially philologists rather than deep on economics
 saath ke dashak se bhashavidon ne bhashaai arthon ke do buniyadi prakaaron ko rekhaankit karnaa shuru kiya
 It is believed that the first type of meaning is congenial in linguistic form
 duusari kism kaa taalluk us rup ke bole jane or us abhivyakti ke sandarbh ke bich anyonyakriya se hota he
 k has been interpreted under differentiation of three
 inamen pehla he bodh or sandarbh ke bich kaa antar
 The second is the difference between the meaning of the word and the meaning of the sentence
 teesraa he paath or sandarbh ke bich kaa antar
 This third difference is now separated from cementics by linguists as a new discipline in the form of pragmatics
 cementics ke tahat jis bhashaa kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he use lakshya-bhashaa kii sangya di jaati he or jis bhashaa main uski vyakhya kii jaati he use metaalenguage kehete hai
 a target language may play the metalinguistic role of its interpretation
 bhashaa-shaastra ke itihaas main arth-grahan sambandhi kavayaden pehle shabd-kendrit thim, phir ve vaakya-kendrit huin or phir ve paath- kendrit ho gayin
 These three processes have influenced the disciplines of media-study, literature, interpretive sociology and cognitive science
 cementics prashn uthaata he ki kisi shabd ke arth kii shinaakht bhashaa ke daayre ke bheetar hi kii jaae yaa arth-nirupan ke liye uske bahari daayre se bhi madad lee jaae
 For example, we know the meaning of chair, but how do we get this meaning? We can say that he sits on a chair
 par, bhashaa ke bheetar kursi kaa arth furniture, mez, seat yaa bench jaise anya arthon sahit uske sambandh ke saath bhi grahan kiya jaataa he
 The meaning of the chair used to sit with these words is different
 bodh or sandarbh ke bich antar kaa ek or udhaaharan shukr grah yaa venus he
 It is also called the morning star and evening star, because its brightness is visible in the morning and also in the night
 is tarah shukr, bhor kaa tara or sandhya-tara ek hi chiz ke teen naam hai
 But despite the context being the same, all three are used for different realizations
 cementics kaa jor sandarbh par kam or bodh par adhik rahata chunki arth-grahan ke hi chahta he, isliye vah nateeja nikalataa he ki yatharth kii samaj bhi bhashaa ke zariye hi hasil ho sakati he or uske liye samskruti, itihaas or anya bhautik prakriyaaon kaa koi mahatva nahin he
 Cementics uses three main relations synonyms, antonyms, and hyponomicals to achieve semantics within the language
 hyponanimakal shrenee ve aate jinke main shabd abhivyaktiyaan bhi shaamil hoti hai
 For example, a dog is also an animal like a cat, monkey, giraffe or rabbit and can also be a terrier, hound, German Shepherd or retriever
 dhyaan dene ke baat yah he ki ye teenon rup kisi suparibhaashit bhashaai pranali ke bheetar arth rachane ke kaam zarur aate hai, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki arth-grahan or arth- rachana kii saamaajik or saamudayik prakriyaayein bhi unki mohataaj hoti hon
 For example, there can also be a community that constructs the meaning of words without these three relations, that is, outside the realm of language
 uttar america main hopi ek aisa he pakshiyon chhod sabhi vaali chizon ke liye alag-alag ke bajaay ek hi shabd kaa istemaal hota he
 The people of this clan give the name 'masayataka' to a mosquito, balloon and plane or something similar
 vaakyon ke madhyam se shabdaarth grahan karnaa bhi cementics ke daayre main aata he
 'ramesh bought house from Umesh' is actually synonymous with 'umesh sold house to Ramesh'
 isi tarah kaa samanarthak sambandh ‘police ne andolankariyon ko girakrataar kar liya’ kaa ‘andolankaaree police dwaara girakrataar kar liye gayi’ ke bich he
 Similarly, other meanings are formed between sentences
 udhaaharan ke liye ‘america commando unit ke haathon osama bin laden maaraa gaya’ or ‘osama bin laden maaraa gaya’ ke bich kaa arth-sambandh dekha ja saktaa he
 If according to the first sentence, the US commando unit has actually killed Osama, then the second sentence also wants to represent the reality that will be accepted as true
 arth ke lihaaz se ek vaakya kii duusare par nirbharta ke saath- saath vaakya apane arth ke liye usamen antarnihit purv-manyata par bhi nirbhar karte hai
 Such as: 'according to a statement of the Ministry of Defense, India should exercise the powers to prevent Pakistan from promoting cross-border terrorism'
 is vaakya main do purv- manyataayen nihit hai : pehali, bharat ke paas aavashyak shaktiyaan hai or duusari, pakistan seemaa-paar aatankwaad ko protsaahit kar rahaa he
 In the last ten years, there has been tremendous linguistic work in the fields of Cementics and Pragmatics
 vaakyon or shabdon ke arthon ke bich antar karne vaali ye cementic kavayaden upar se dekhne main bahut maamuli lag sakati hai, par kisi ibaarat main antarnihit vichaardhaaratmak taatparyon or daavedaariyon ko saamne laane ke liye inaki ahmiyat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Economic changes can also be studied in several terms of political science by taking the help of cementics and pragmatics
 masalan, loktantr kaa arth arestu ke jamaane se lekar kaafii dinon tak saadhaaran logon yaa unki bheed ke tantra yani avyavasthit or arajak pranali ke rup main lagaaya jaataa rahaa he
 But today democracy has become rigid in the sense of a working system according to a systematic procedure
 isliye jaise hi koi maang yaa andolan kii prakriyaaon sidhe hastkshep kii maang karata he, use vyavastha ke liye khatara qaraar diya jane lagata he
 The entire revolution movement under the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan in India created similar economic anxiety by demanding the right of representative return
 anna hajaare ke netritv main chale bhrashtachar virdohi andolan ne bhi loktantr se judi arth-sambandhi samasyaon ko pesh kiya he
 Now it is the job of philosophers and thinkers of democracy to make an economical explanation of this change in the meaning of democracy

 Under science, electronics or electronics is that area of science and technology that studies the flow of charge through different types of mediums and the devices based on them
 praudyogiki ke rup main electronic vah kshetra he jo vibhinn electronic yuktiyon aadi) kaa prayog karke upyukt vidyut paripath kaa nirmaan karne evam unke dwaara vidyut sanketon ko vaanchit tareeke se badalane se sambandhit he
 This includes the study of various types of devices, improvement of them and creation of new devices etc
 aitihaasik rup se electronic evam vaidyut praudyogiki kaa kshetra samaan rahaa he or dono ko ek duusare se alag nahi mana jaataa tha
 But now, with the expansion of new devices, circuits and the functions they perform, electronics has started to be taught as a separate branch of electrical technology
 is drushti se adhik vidyut-shakti se sambandhit kshetron ko vidyut praudyogiki ke antargat mana jaataa he jabaki kam vidyut shakti evam vidyut sanketon ke bhaanti-bhaatin ke parivartanon se sambandhit kshetra ko electronic kaha jaataa he
 Based on circuits, electronic technology is mainly divided into two parts: in paripathon main vidyut sanket satat hote hai or unka prasanskaran karne ke baad bhi ve satat hi bane rahete hai
 For example, the transistor-amplifier is an analog system
 oparational emplifire ke vikaas evam ai-si ke rup main isaki uplabdhta se analog electranix main ek kranti aa gayi
 It consists of electrical signals numeric
 ankiy sanket bahut tarah ke ho sakate hai kintu binary digital sanket sabase adhik upyog main aate hai

 are some examples of binary signals
 jabase ekikrut paripathon kaa pradurbhaav hua he or ek choti si chip main lakhon karondon electronic yuktiyaan bhari jane lageen hai tab se digital electronic bahut mahatvapurn ho gayi he
 Modern personal computers and cell phones, digital cameras etc
 are the product of digital electronics
 ankiy electronic ne signal-processing ko ek nayaa aayam diya he jise digital signal processing kehete hai
 It is very convenient and effective compared to analog signal processing

 a revolution is a fundamental change in the rights or organizational structure that takes place in a relatively short period of time
 arestu ne do prakaar kii raajnneetik krantiyon kaa varnan kiya he: Many revolutions have occurred in human history and they are quite different in terms of method, duration and persuasive ideological theory
 inke parinaamon ke kaaran samskruti, arthvyavastha or saamaajik-raajnneetik sansthaaon main vrihad parivartan hue
 The scholarly discussion is centered around a number of issues in relation to which components are involved in a revolution and which are not
 krantiyon ke praarambhik adhyayan main mukhyatah europea itihaas kaa manovaigyanik drushtikon se vishleshan kiya gaya he, parantu or aadhunik pareekshanon main vaishvik ghatnaayen bhi shaamil hai or anekon saamaajik vigyaanon ke drushtikonon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he jisame samajashaastra or raajnneeti vigyaan aate hai
 Several generations of scholarly views on the revolution have given rise to many competing theories and have contributed greatly to developing the current understanding of this complex fact
 kopernicus ne surya ke chaaron ore grahon kii gati par likhe gaye apane lekh ko "on da rivolushan of selestial baudies " naam diya
 After this 'revolution' entered into the field of indigenous science related to astrology; Which represented abrupt changes in the social system

 Jeff Goodwin gives two definitions of revolution
 ek vyapak he, jiske anusaar kranti he And a narrow one in which jaik goldstone unhen paribhaashit karte hue kehete hai ki Political and social revolutions have been studied under many social sciences, especially under sociology, political science and history
 Leading scholars in the field include Crane Brinton, Charles Brockett, Farideh Farhey, John Foran, John Mason Hart, Samuel Huntington, Jack Goldstone, Jeff Goodwin, Ted Roberts Gurr, Fred Halliday, Chambers Johnson, Tim mc'daniel, Barrington Moore, Geoffrey Page, Wilfredo Peretto, Terence Ranger, Eugene rosenstock-husey, Theda Skouk Paul, James Scott, Eric Selbin, Charles Tilley, Ellen K
 Trimbringer, Carr Los Vistas, or John Walton, Timothy wickham-crowley and Eric Wolf
 krantiyon ke vidwaan jaise ki jaik goldstone, krantiyon ke sambandh main hue vidvattapurna shodh kaa vibhed chaar vartmaan pidiyon ke rup main karte hai
 First generation scholars such as Gustav Lee Baun, Charles A
 The method of Elwood or Pitirim Sorokin was predominantly descriptive, and the explanations they gave for the fact of revolutions were generally related to social psychology, such as Lee Baun's Crowd Psychology Theory
 duusari peedi ke siddhantvaadi krantiyon ke shuru hone ke kaarnon or samay ke bare main vistrut siddhant viksit karnaa chaahate the, joki adhik jatil saamaajik vyavhaar sambandhi siddhanton main nihit tha
 They can be divided into three major methods: psychological, sociological and political

 He followed cognitive psychology and frustration-aggression theory and saw that the cause of the revolution is the mental state of the general public, while there was a difference of opinion among them as to what actually led people to rebel, all of them
 But agreed that the primary cause of the revolution was widespread frustration towards the socio-political state
 doosraa samooh, joki chalgers johnson, nil smelsar, bob jessoup, mark heart, edward e
 tiryakian, mark hagopian jaise shikshavidon ke dwaara bana tha, usne talcot parcens or samajashaastra kii sanrachanaatmak-prakriyaatmak siddhant kaa anusaran kiya; unhone dekha ki samaaj samgr rup se vibhinn sansadhano, maangon or uppranaaliyon ke madhya samyavastha main he
 As with all psychological ideologies, he differed with regard to the definition of the causes of imbalance, but he agreed that serious imbalance is responsible for the revolution
 antat tisare samooh, jisame charles tili, samuel pi
 hatington, peter amman or arthur el
 stincocombe jaise lekhak shaamil the, ne raajnneeti shaastra ke maarg kaa anusaran kiya or bahuwaadi siddhant va hit samooh sangharsh siddhant par nirbhar rahe
 These theories believe that these incidents are the result of a rights struggle between two competing interest groups
 is prakaar ke pratidarsh main, krantiyaan tab ghatit hoti hai jab do yaa do se adhik samooh saadhaaran nirnayaatmak prakriya main, joki kisi bhi raajnneetik pranali ke liye paaramparik he, sahamat nahin ho pate or saath hi saath unke paas apane lakshya ke anusaran hetu sena niyukti ke liye paryaapt sansaadhan uplabdh hote hai
 Second generation theorists saw that the development of revolutions is a dual process; First, some changes in the present state give results that are different from the results of the past; Second, the new state provides an opportunity for the revolution to occur
 aisi avasthaa main, ek ghatana joki bhootkaal main kranti karwaane ke liye paryaapt nahin thi, vahi ab iske liye paryaapt hoti he- haalanki yadi adhikari aise khataron ke prati sachet rahenge, to is avasthaa main bhi vah virodh ko roak sakate hai 
 Numerous early studies related to revolutions attempted to focus on four fundamental issues — the unambiguous and uncontroversial example that is indeed accurate for all definitions of revolutions, such as the Glorious Revolution, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Chinese Revolution
 
 haalanki, prasidd harvard itihaaskaar, kraine brinton ne apni prasidd pustak "da anatumi of rivolushan" main angreji grihayuddh, america kranti, francisi kranti or roosi kranti par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 Over time, scholars began to analyze hundreds of other events as revolution, and differences in their definitions and methods gave rise to new definitions and explanations
 duusari peedi ke siddhanton kii aalochana unke simit bhugolic prasar, anubhavik satyaapan kii kathinaaiyon or saath hi saath is aadhaar par kii gayi ki haalanki vah kuch vishesh krantiyon kaa spashtikaran detii hai lekin is baat ke liye koi spashtikaran nahin de paati ki inhi paristhitiyon main anya samaajon main vidroh kyun nahin hue
 The second generation of Alochhana led to the creation of a third generation of theories, including Theda Skoukpaul, Barrington Moore, Geoffrey Page and other authors who were expanding their focus on the basis of the ancient Marxist class struggle, focusing their attention on rural agrarian state struggle, State conflicts with upper-class people and domestic political change through inter-state economic and military competition
 Hne effects were focused on
 visheshtah scockpaul kii stats and soshal rivolushans teesri peedi kii sarvaadhik prachlit kritiyon main se ek ho gayi; scockpaul ne kranti kii vyakhya karte hue kaha "yah samaaj ke rajyon or varg sanrachana kaa teevr, moulik roopantaran he
 

which is supported and accepted by lower level class based rebellions "and he held the revolutions responsible for various conflicts related to the state, upper class and lower class
 1980 ke dashak ke antim varshon se vidvattapurna kaaryon ke ek nae nikaay ne teesri peedi ke siddhanton kii prabhavakaarita par prashn uthaane shuru kar die
 The old theories were also greatly shocked by the new revolutionary events which could not be expressed easily by them
 1979 main irani or rnikraguan krantiyaan, 1986 main philipinos main janashakti kranti or 1989 main europe main autom of neshans is baat ke gavaah bane ki ahimsak krantiyon main prasidd pradarshan evam jan hadtaal main kai shaktishaalee prathit hone vaale shasno ko bahu varg sanyog ne dhwast kar diya
 It was no longer enough to define revolution or rebellion as a European violent state versus a public or class struggle

 Due to the natural tendency of liquids in which they lead to a region of higher density, currents are formed
 duusare kaaran main surya kii kirane jal kii sataha par ek samaan nahin padatin
