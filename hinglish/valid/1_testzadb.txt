 kambuj yaa kamboj cambodia kaa pracheen sanskrit naam he
 The earliest Indian colony in the erstwhile Indochina peninsula was established in the Funan region around the first century AD
 lagbhag 600 varshon tak phunaan ne is pradesh main hindu samskruti kaa prachaar evam prasar karne main mahatvapurn yoga diya
 Subsequently, a great kingdom of Kambuj or Kambhoj was established in this region, whose glorious tradition of wonderful opulence continued till the 14th century AD
 is pracheen vaibhav ke avshesh aaj bhi angkorwat, angkorthom naamak sthanon main vartmaan hai
 According to the ancient legends of Kamboj, the foundation of this colony was laid by King Kambu Swayambhuva of 'aryadesh'
 vah bhagavan shiv kii prerana se kamboj desh main aae or yahan basii hui naag jati ke raja kii sahaayta se unhone is junglee marusthal main ek nayaa rajya basaaya jo nagaraj kii adbhut jaaduugari se hare bhare, sundar pradesh main parinat ho gaya
 Kambu married Nagaraj's daughter Mera and laid the foundation of the Kambuj dynasty
 yah bhi sambhav he ki bhartiya kamboj se bhi indochin main sthit is upnivesh kaa sambandh rahaa ho
 In the third century AD, an ambassador of Murunds who had settled on the northwestern border of India reached Funan and probably brought the horse of Kamboj with them
 kamboj ke pratham aitihaasik rajvansh kaa sansthaapak shrutvarman tha jisane kamboj desh ko phunaan kii adheenta se mukt kiya
 His son Shresthavarman settled the capital named Shresthapur in his name whose ruins are located near Watfu hill in Laos
 tatpashchaat bhavavarman ne, jiskaa sambandh phunaan or kamboj donon hi rajwanshon se tha, ek nayaa vansh chalaaya or apane hi naam bhavapur naamak rajdhani basaai
 The development of Kamboj begins with the time of Bhavavarman and his brother Mahendravarman
 phunaan kaa purana rajya ab jeernsheern ho chukaa tha or sheeghra hi is nae durgharsh samrajya main villin ho gaya
 After Mahendravarman's death, his son Ishaanavarman ascended the throne
 is pratapi raja ne kamboj rajya kii simaaon kaa dur-dur tak vistaar kiya
 He established diplomatic relations with India and Champa and built a new capital named Ishanpur
 ishanvarman ne champa ke raja jagaddharm ko apni putree byaahi thi jiskaa putr prakashdharm apane pita kii mrityu ke pashchaat champa kaa raja hua
 This suggests that Champa was under the political influence of Kamboj at this time
 ishanvarman ke baad bhavavarman dwitiya or jayavarman pratham kamboj nareshon ke naam milte hai
 This dynasty came to an end in 674 AD after Jayavarman
 kuch hi samay ke uparaant kamboj kii shakti ksheen hone lagi or dhire-dhire 8veen sadi i
 main java ke shailendra raajaaon kaa kamboj desh par aadhipatay sthapit ho gaya
 The Kamboj history of the 8th century AD is not very clear, but as soon as the beginning of the 9th century, the power of this ancient empire resurfaced
 iskaa shrey jayavarman dwitiya ko diya jaataa he
 He laid the foundation of Angkor dynasty and liberated Kamboj from the subjugation of Java
 usne sambhavat: bharat se hiranyadas naamak brahman ko bulawaakar apane rajya kii suraksha ke liye tantric kriyaayein karwaain
 This scholar Brahmin founded a sect called Devaraja which soon became the kingship of Kamboj
 jayavarman ne apni rajdhani kramash: kuti, hariharaalay or amrendrapur naamak nagaron main banaai jisase spasht he ki vartmaan cambodia kaa praaia: samast kshetra uske adheen tha or rajya kii shakti kaa centre dhire-dhire purv se pashchim kii ore badhata hua antat: angkore ke pradesh main sthapit ho gaya tha
 Jayavarman II was named Kambujarajendra and his Maharani under the name Kambujarajalakshmi during his time
 isi samay se cambodia ke pracheen naam kambuj yaa kamboj kaa videshi lekhakon ne bhi prayog karnaa prarambh kar diya tha
 Even after Jayavarman II, the empire of Kamboj continued to grow and grow and within a short time the empire of Kamboj spread throughout the Indochina peninsula
 maharaj indravarman ne anek mandiron or tadaagon kaa nirmaan karavaaya
 Yashovarman was a scholar of Hindu scriptures and Sanskrit poetry and he gave royalty to many scholars
 uske samay ke anek sundar sanskrit abhilekh prapya hai
 During this period, there was unprecedented progress of Hinduism, literature and period
 yashovarman ne kambupuri yaa yashodharpur naam kii nai rajdhani basaai
 Angkor Thom, the great center of religion and culture, also adorned this city
 'angkore samskruti' kaa swarnakaal isi samay se hi pranrabh hota he
 In 944 AD, Rajendravarman was the king of Kamboj, whose large inscriptions of the time are found written in beautiful Sanskrit poetry
 1001 i
 tak kaa samay kamboj ke itihaas main mahatvapurn he kyonki is kaal main kamboj kii seemayen china ke dakshini bhaag chooti thim, laos uske antargat tha or uskaa raajnneetik prabhaav syam or uttari malaya tak failaa hua tha
 Suryavarman i established Kamboj's suzerainty over almost all of Siamese and also invaded the southern Brahmadesh
 vah sahitya, nyaay or vyakaran kaa pandit tha tathaa swayan buddha hote hue bhi shaiva or vaishnav dharmon kaa premi or sangrakshak tha
 He tried to reinvigorate the state by ending the civil war in the country at the time of his coronation
 uttari champa ko jitkar suryavarman ne use kamboj kaa karad rajya bana liya kintu sheeghra hi dakshin champa ke raja jayahari varman se haar manani padi
 At this time there was a lot of unrest in Cambog due to civil wars and conflicts with neighboring countries
 jayavarman saptam ke rajyakaal main pun: ek baar kamboj kii pracheen yash:pataakaa fahraane lagi
 He formed a large army which included the soldiers of Siamese and Brahmadesh
 jayavarman ne anaam par akraman kar use jeetne kaa bhi prayaas kiya kintu nirantar yudhon ke kaaran shanai: shanai: kamboj kii sainik shakti kaa hraas hone laga, yahan tak ki 1220 i
 main kambojon ko champa se hatana padaa
 But even then Jayavarman VII is counted among the great rulers of Kamboj as it was during that time that the expansion of the empire of Kamboj reached its extreme limit
 jayavarman saptam ne apni nai rajdhani vartmaan angkorthom main banaai thi
 Its ruins are still counted among the famous ancient relics of the world
 nagar ke chaturdik ek unchaa parkota tha or 110 gaj chaudee ek parikha thi
 Its length was about eight and a half miles

 These Rajpaths were found near the Virat Hindu Temple in Beyoncé, which was located in the center of the city

 It is known from an inscription at this time that there were 789 temples and 102 hospitals and 121 hospital houses in Kamboj
 jayavarman saptam ke pashchaat kamboj ke itihaas ke anek sthal adhik spasht nahin hai
 In the 13th century, Kamboj lacked strong political power
 kuch itihasalekhakon ke anusaar kamboj ne 13veen sadi ke antim charan main china ke samrat kuble khan kaa aadhipaty maanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 a messenger Angkorthom arrived from China in 1296 AD, a member of which shu-tan-kuan wrote a detailed and entertaining account of the then Kambos which was translated into French in 1902 AD
 14veen sadi main kamboj ke padosi rajyon main nai raajnneetik shakti kaa udai ho rahaa tha tathaa syam or champa ke thai log kamboj kii ore badhane kaa nirantar prayaas kar rahe the
 The result was that there was a lot of pressure from two sides on Kamboj and it started to crush between the millstones of these two countries
 dhire-dhire kamboj kii pracheen mahatta samaapt ho gai or ab yah desh indochin kaa ek saadhaaran pichhadaa hua pradesh banakar rah gaya
 In the 19th century, French influence increased in Indochina; By the way, they came to this peninsula in the 16th century itself and were looking for an opportunity to increase their power
 vah avasar ab or 1854 i
 main kamboj ke nirbal raja ankaduong ne apana desh francisiyon ke haathon saunp diya
 Noordam i confirmed the deal on 11 August 1863 AD and for the next 80 years, Cambose or Cambodia remained a part of french-indochina

 main francisiyon ko ek nae samanaite par hastakshar karne par vivash kar diya jisase unhone cambodia kii swatantra raajnneetik satta ko sweekaar kar liya, kintu ab bhi desh ko french union ke antargat hi rakhaa gaya tha
 Cambodia's influential King Noradam Sinhanuk continued his national movement against it
 inke praytn se cambodia sheeghra hi swatantra raashtra ban gaya or ye apane desh ke pratham pradhan mantri chune gaye
 Kamboj was an Indian colony in real sense

 Hinduism and the Vaishnava sect and then Buddhism were the kings of the Kambos and many Sanskrit inscriptions here would find it difficult to separate them from the Indian inscriptions due to their religious and mythological cultural background
 udhaaharan ke liye rajendravarman ke ek vishaal abhilekh kaa keval ek ansh yahan prastut he jisamen shiv kii vandana kii gai he : The old Arab tourists rightly named Kamboj as the Hindu country

 Thousands of Sanskrit words in Kambuj language in their Kambuji or Khmer form are still found today

 a beautiful depiction of the social condition of Kamboj, the description of shu-tan-kutan is as follows- cambodia - kamboj kaa arvachin naam he
 It is a country on the Indian China Peninsula which was freed from French occupation in 1955 AD

 yah mana jaataa he ki donon ke swabhaav alag the or vyavsaay kaise kiya jaae is par alag raay thi
 While Mr

 Should be done in estate so that profit is made / profit is made

 Another theory is that it is derived from Chit + Ambalam

 or bhi adhik krodhit ho jane par, rishigan aahvaan kar ke ek bhayanak baagh ko paidaa kar dete hai, jisaki khaal nikaalkar bhagwaan chadar ke rup main apni qamar par baandh lete hai
 When completely discouraged, the sages collect all their spiritual powers and invoke Muyalkan, a powerful demon - a symbol of complete ignorance and pride

 Seeing this, the sages realize that this deity is true and is beyond magic and rituals and he surrenders

 Others are: chidambaram un paanch sthalon main se bhi ek he jahaan ke liye yah kaha jaataa he ki bhagwaan shiv ne in sthanon par nrity kiya tha or in sabhi sthalon par manch / sabhaayen hai
 Apart from Chidambaram the place where Por Sabhai is, others are Ratina Sabhai in Thiruvalangadu, Chitra Sabhai in Kortallam, Rajat Sabhai or Veli Ambalam in Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple and Thamira Sabhai in Nellaiyappar Temple in Tirunelveli

 chitrakootem ko kulsekara alvar or tirimangai mannan alvar dwaara gaaya gaya tha
 Both the Alvars have said that Chidambaram Brahman is the Brahman who was worshiping the Vedic and proper God in Chitrakootam

 But all such claims are meaningless as a close study of Azhwars Mangalsasanam reveals the religious places which are placed in an order based on geographical location like Mahabalipuram, Thiruvayindrapuram, Chidambaram, Sirgazhi, Tirunangur etc
 On the part of Vaishnava fraternities, it has also been historically claimed that originally this temple was the abode of Lord Sri Govindarajaswamy and Lord Shiva came to contact him with his companions so that he could become the judge of the dance competition between the couple
 Lord Govindarajaswamy agreed to this and the dance competition between the two Shiva and Parvati was on par, during which Lord Shiva went to Sri Govindarajaswamy to find a way to emerge victorious and he indicated that he would raise one of his feet
 Can dance in mahilaon ke liye, natya ashaastra ke anusaar yah mudra varjit thi isiilie jab antat bhagwaan shiv is mudra main aa gaye to parvati ne paraajay sweekaar kar lee or isiilie is sthaan par bhagwaan shiv kii murti nrity mudra main he
 The dance stage or open ground is often called Ambalam
 bhagwaan govindrajaswami is pratispardhaa ke nirnayakarta or sakshi donon hi the
 But later during the cultural invasion of Shaivite religious kings such as Kirumi Kanda Chola etc
 this place was further promoted as a Shaivite religious site

 The management and administration of the temple is traditionally looked after by Chidambaram Dixitar - it is a class of Vedic Brahmins who, according to mythology, were brought here from Mount Kailash by Saint Patanjali, mainly in the editing of daily rites and the Chidambaram temple
 To oversee
 aisa mana jaataa he ki deekshitar samudaay ke logon kii sankhya 3000 thi or unhen tillai muveyrum kaha jaataa tha
 Today they number 360
 yah deekshitar shivachaariyon yaa adhisiveron ke vipareet vaidic sanskaron kaa paalan karte hai - jo bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana ke liye aagmik sanskaron kaa paalan karte hai
 The rites performed in the temple are synonymous with the Vedas and were prescribed by Patanjali, for whom it is believed that he appointed the people of the Dixitara community to worship Lord Shiva as Nataraja
 aam taur par, dikshitar parivaar kaa prayek vivaahit purush sadsy mandir main sanskaron ko nishpadit karne kaa avasar paata he or vah us din ke pramukh pujari ke rup main bhi kaary kar saktaa he
 Married Dixitars are also entitled to get a share of the income of the temple
 haalanki yah mana jaataa he ki mandir ko lagbhag 5,000 acre upjau bhoomi kaa daan diya gaya he - or mandir anek shaskaon dwaara kai shatabdiyon tak sangrakshan bhi diya gaya he, aaj, iskaa prabandhan lagbhag puri tarah se nijee daan ke dwaara ho rahaa he
 The day begins with the chief priest of the day performing the sacraments of consecrating himself and accepting the Shivaham, after which he enters the temple to perform daily rites
 din kaa armbh subah 7 baje palliyarai se bhagwaan kii charanpaduka ko ek palki main rakhkar pavitra garbh grih main len ke dwaara hota he, is palki ke peeche majira, amlann or mrudang liye hue bhaktagan hote hai
 The priests then begin the daily rites with yagna and 'gau puja'
 puja din main 6 baar kii jaati he
 Before each puja, the sphatika linga - the 'aru Urva' or the half-form of Lord Shiva is anointed with ghee, milk, curd, rice, sandalwood mixture and holy bhashm
 iske baad bhagwaan ko naivedhyam yaa taaje bane khaane or mishthan kaa bhoga lagaaya jaataa he or diparadhana kii jaati he, yah ek rasm hoti he jisame vibhinn prakaar ke sajaavati deepak bhagwaan ko dikhaae jate hai, sanskrit main vedon or panchpuraanon kaa uccharan kiya jaataa he
 The worship ends with the priest removing the curtain of the sanctum sanctorum to reveal the Chidambara mystery
 duusari puja ke purv, niyamit vastuon se sphatik ke ling ke abhishek ke atirikt, ek maanik ke nataraj devtaa par bhi in sab vastuon kaa lepan kiya jaataa he

 raat ko paanchavi puja se pehle, pujari chidambara rahasy main, jahaan unhone sugandhit padaarthon dwaara yantra par lepan kiya tha or 'naivedhyam' arpit kiya tha, vahiin par kuch vishesh sanskaron kaa nishpaadan karte hai
 In Chidambaram, the last puja, called Arthajama Puja, is performed with special enthusiasm
 yah mana jaataa he ki jab raat main devtaa nivrutt hote hai to brahmand kii sabhi daivik shaktiyaan unke andar nivrutt ho jaati hai

 The Tamil Nadu government has the authority over the temple under Section 45 of the HR&CE Act

 These are celebrated as major festivals in which the main deity is taken out of the sanctum sanctorum as a procession, including a chariot visit to the temple after a long consecration program
 is abhishek kaarykram ko dekhne ke liye or jab devtaa ko waapas garbhagrih main le jaaya jaataa he to bhagwaan kaa paaramparik nrity dekhne ke liye saikadon or hajaaron log ekatra hote hai
 There are indications in Umapathi Sivam's work 'kunchithangristhavan' that the god was taken out as a procession even during the Kamasi festival, though it is no longer in vogue

 It is mentioned in the Puranas that Saint Pulikalamunivar directed many works of the temple through King Simmavarman
 pallav raajaaon main, simmavarman naam ke teen raja the 
 chunki mandir kavi-sant thirunavukkraasar ke samay main pehle se hi prasiddh tha, isliye is baat kii adhik sambhaavna he ki simmavarman 430-458 ke kaal main tha, arthath simmavarman II
 kottra vankudi main tamra patron par kii gai pattayam yaa ghoshnaaen is baat ko siddh karte hai
 However, Thandanathotta Pattayam and other Pattayams of the Pallava period further indicate that Simmavarman had a connection with the Chidambaram temple
 atah yah mana jaataa he ki simmavarman pallav rajvansh ke rajkumaar the jinhone rajasi adhikaron kaa tyaag kar diya tha or aakar chidambaram main rahane lage the
 Since it is found that Pulikal Munivar and Simmavarman were contemporaries, it is believed that the temple was built during this period
 haalanki, yah tathy ki sant-kavi manikavyasagar chidambaram main rahe or alokik gyaan ko paaya kintu unka kaal sant-kavi thirunavukkraasar ke bahut pehle kaa he or jaisaa ki bhagwaan nataraj or unki vishisht mudra or prastuti kii tulana pallav vansh ke anya kaaryon se nahin kii ja sakati kyonki yah bahut shreshth he, isliye yah sambhav he ki mandir kaa astitv simmavarman ke samay se ho or baad ke kaal main bhi koi pulikaalamuniver naam ke sant hue hon
 Large-scale repair and renovation works are carried out at periodic intervals, new facilities are added and distinguished
 adhikansh pracheen mandir bhi samay ke saath va nayi suvudhaon ke dwaara 'viksit' ho gaye hai, vah shaasha jinhone mandir ko sangrakshan diya, unke dwaar or adhik bahari galiyare or gopuram kaa nirmaan karavaaya gaya
 Although this process helped the existence of temples as places of worship, in a complete archeological or historical point of view, these navigators destroyed the original actual works of the Amandir without intention - which was the later grand temple plans
 Did not equate with chidambaram mandir bhi is aam chalan kaa apwaad nahin he
 The origin and development of the temple is therefore largely extracted from the context of literary and poetic works, with oral information being passed down from generation to generation by the Dixitar community and now through the very few manuscripts and inscriptions remaining
 sangam sahitya ke madhyam se ham yah jaanate hai ki ki chol vansh ke shaasha is pracheen dharmik sthal ke mahaan bhakt the
 It is said of the Chola king Kochengannan that he was born after kings Subhadevan and Kamaladevi, who are worshiped in the Thillai Golden Hall
 atah is baat ki sambhaavna he ki swarna haul sahit yah mandir aaj se hajaaron varsh purv se astitv main he
 The architecture of the temple - especially the architecture of the sanctum sanctorum, does not even match the architecture of any other temple of the Chola dynasty, Pandey dynasty or Pallava dynasty
 ek seemaa tak, mandir ke is rup main kuch nishchit samanthaayen he jo chera vansh ke mandir ke roopon se mail karti hai lekin chera rajvansh kaa sabase pracheen sandarbh jo uplabdh he vah kavi-sant sundarar ke kaal kaa he
 Unfortunately the available evidence of the Chidambaram temple or its related work dates back to the 10th century and beyond
 chidambaram mandir se sambandhit kai shilaalekh aasapaas ke kshetron main or swayan mandir main bhi uplabdh hai
 Most of the available inscriptions belong to the following periods: dakshin gopuram raja pandya dwaara nirmit tha
 The proof of this is found by the fish emblem of the Pandya dynasty, which has been carved out of roof
 aitihaasik drushti se, yah man jaataa he ki gopiram kaa nirmaan purna hone par pandya rajvansh ne vahaan par ek duusare kii or sammukh do machhliyon ko gadhwaya tha 
 dakshin gopuram main pandya rajvansh kaa do machhliyon vaala pratik chinh he
 It seems that after this Gopuram was rebuilt by Pallava king Koperunsingen i 1216-1242 CE, after completing the first level
 Gopuram is called Sokkasiyan Thirunilai Ezhugopuram
 pashchimi gopuram jadavavarman sundar pandyan i 1251-1268 dwaara banwaaya gaya tha
 North Gopuram was built by King Krishnadevarayaar of Vijayanagar 1509-1529 CE
 poorviy gopuram sabase pehle pallav raja coperunsingan II 1243-1279 dwaara banwaaya gaya tha
 Even after this the repair work was carried out by Subbammal who was the mother-in-law of the famous philanthropist Puchaiyappa Muladiyar
 pachaippa muladiyar or unki patni ialammal kii murti poorviy gopuram main gadhi gayi he
 Till date Pachaiyappa Trust is responsible for various works of the temple and also maintains the chariot of the temple
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki chitasabha kii swarna yukt chat chol raja parantka i dwaara dalwaayi gayi thi
 Raja Parantaka II, Rajaraja Chola I, Kulothunga Chola i made significant donations for the temple
 rajraja chol kii beti kundaavai II bhi mandir ko swarna or dhan sampatti daan karne ke liye jaani jaati hai
 Later the Chola king Vikram Chola also gave considerable donations to the temple for performing daily rites
 mandir ko anekon raajaaon, shaskaon or sangrakshakon dwaara swarna or aabhushan daan kiye gaye, - jisame pudukottai ke maharaj sheri sethupathi, british aadi the
 Unlike many temples in northern India which were attacked by many foreign invaders, the temples of South India have been peaceful for many ages

 However, even this peaceful history has not remained untouched by light gun encounters

 ve 1966 me nobel puraskaar se sammanit hue
 In the middle of the twentieth century there was a dispute over the way physics was taught in good universities
 is vivaad ko finemen jaisaa hi vyakti anjaam de saktaa tha kyonki unka rutaba sabhi maanate the
 He was not respected because he was at Cal Tech, but Cal Tech was considered to be the best physics university in the world because the finmen were there
 finemen ne 1961-63 me cyle-tech me snaatak ke vidhyaarthiyon ko bhautik shaastra padhaayaa
 These three years gave a new direction to teach physics and physics started to be taught with new subjects
 in lekcharon ko teen kitabon ne badla gaya
 She was in red bindings and became known as' Lectures on Physics by Richard p Feynman
 richard philips finemen, kaa janm 11 may 1918 main hua tha or mrityu 1988 main cancer se ho gayi
 As a kid, finmen often wondered what he would grow up to be: a jester or a scientist
 bade hokar unhone in dono bhoomikaaon ko ek saath bakhubi nibhaayaa
 People say why he became so famous, but scientists rightly say about him: ' finemen to aitihaasik vyakti hai unako jitna sammaan mila ve us sab ke adhikari hai
 ' finemen ke pita kaa baton ko bataane kaa apana hi dhang tha
 There is a one time story that father and son were walking in the park, father pointed to a bird and told that this bird is known by different names in the world

 But what is important is what and how she does it

 At school he was the best in mathematics and the hero of the mathematics team
 par unhone ganit ko chhod diya
 He felt that by getting higher education in Mathematics, he could not do anything other than teaching Mathematics to others
 vah kuch vyavhaarik karne kaa soch kar, pehle electrical ingeneering kii taraf gayi par baad main bhautik shaastra kii padhai kii
 Fineman completed his undergraduate education at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
 vah vahiin par shodh kaary karnaa chaahate the par phir prinkton me shodh kaary karne ke liye chale gayi
 Later they used to say, 'yah thik hi tha
 i came to know that the world is very big and there are many good places to work
 ' Young princes got a chance to do research with Wheeler in Princeton
 us samay tak whealer ko nobel purushkaar to nahin mila tha par ve vah kaam kar chuke the jis par unhe baad me nobel purushkaar mila
 They were very fanciful, some even expressed their importance
 unhone finemen ko saptaah main ek din kaa kuch nishchit samay milane kaa diya
 On the first day of the meeting, he was wearing a suit, took out his gold break from his pocket and placed it on the table so that the finemen would know when his time was up
 finemen us samay vidhyaarthee the
 They bought an inexpensive stop watch from a market - they had no money to buy expensive watches
 agali meeting par unhone apni sasti ghadi us sone kii ghadi ke paas rakh di
 Wheeler should also know that his time is also important
 whealer ko majaak samaj main aayaa or dono dil khol kar hanse
 Both of them removed the watches
 unka rishta aupchaarik nahin rahaa, ve mitra ban gayi, unki baaten hansi majaak main badal gayin or hansi-majaak naye moulik vichaaron me
 Meanwhile, a second great war has started

 In America's Los Almos Laboratory, the scientists of the world gathered and united to make atomic bombs
 finemen ko bhi vahaan bulaayaa gaya or unhone vahaan kaam kiya
 In Los Almos, security was the responsibility of the army, which had its own laws
 yah niyam finemen ko aksar samaj me nahin aate the
 Finemen were expert in opening locks
 ve sena ke adhikariyon ko tang karne ke liye kii leboratory kii tijoriyon khol kar usame kaagaj par guess who likh kar chhod dete the par tijoriyon se kuch nikaalte nahin the
 He used to do this only to tell the army officers how wrong his security system is

 There was no treatment

 ho jane ke kaaran, finemen use chuum bhi nahin sakate the
 He knew that his relationship with Arlene would be only spiritual
 in sab ke baavjood, finemen arlin se shaadi karnaa chaahate the
 His family and friends were against this marriage
 is bare me unki apane pita se anban bhi ho gayi
 Despite this, the finemen married Arlene
 finemen, jab los elmos main kaam kar rahe the to vahaan ke nideshak raubart openhaimar ne arlin ko paas hi ke seniterium main bharti karvaa diya taaki finemen usase mil sake
 Arlene died while the Finemen were in Los Almos
 is ghatana chakra par ek pikchar bhi bani he jiskaa naam infinity ) he ise matheyu bordwik ne nirdeshit kiya he
 Finemen were alive and often worked for fun
 mouj masti me hi unhone us vishay par kaam kiya jis par unhe nobel puruskaar mila
 This is also an interesting anecdote
 duusare mahayuddh ke dauraan los elmos laboretary main finemen kii mitrataa beth se hui jinase unki kaaphi patati thi
 Beth was in the court, so the finmen also went to the court
 ek din ve kauranal ke alpaahar grih main baithe the
 a student threw a plate there
 plate safed rang kii thi or usamen bich main kauranal kaa laal rang kaa chinh tha
 The plate was also wavering and moving around
 yah ajeeb nazaaraa tha
 The finemen began to waver and roar and to find a relationship between them
 isame kaaphi mushkil ganit ke sameekaran lagate the
 It took him a lot of time
 unhone paaya ki dono me 2:1 kaa sambandh he
 His colleagues told him why he is wasting time in it
 unka jawaab tha, 'it does not matter, i am doing all this for fun
 ' But he was not right about its importance
 ve jab electron ke ghoomane ke bare main shodh karne lage to unhen kauranal kii dagamagaati or gumti plate main lagi ganit phir se yaad aane lagi
 This led to the principle that he received the Nobel Prize
 sach he jivan main bahut kuch vah bhi aavashyak he jo keval mouj masti ke liye ho, chaahe uskaa koi or mahatv ho yaa na ho - mouj masti hi apane aap me ek mahatv kii baat he
 If you can find your livelihood in fun, then what is the matter, if it cannot be, then maybe it is another good thing to find fun in livelihood itself
 finemen na hi ek mahaan vaigyanik the par ek mahaan adhyaaapak bhi the
 He knew how to make his point known to another
 vyaakhyaanshaala unke liye rangashaala thi, jisamen naatak bhi tha or aatishbaajee bhi
 i have started this article in the introduction of cal-tech lectures on physics by Finemen
 in lekcharon ko unhone sitambar 1961-may 1963 me diya tha
 These lectures were special, so they were kept safe forever and later these three were printed as red books
 finemen saptaah main keval do lacture dete the baaki samay vah in lekcharon ko taiyaar karne main lagaate the
 They used to consider every line of lecture, every joke in advance
 kabhi bhi unke saath lacture ke notus nahin hote the
 There was only a small paper in which some special words were there only to indicate further
 yah teen saal, sansar me kisi bhi vishvavidhyalay ke, kisi bhi vishay par ke lekcharon me adwitiya hai
 It never happened like this or maybe it will happen again
 kyonki malum nahin ki phir kabhi aisa vyakti aayegaa ki nahin
 English was a useless and philosophical subject for the fine men
 Religion se unka koi vaasta nahin tha
 It was not in his interest to talk about the rounds
 vah hameshaa sidhi baat karte the
 They meant what they used to say
 ve is baat se bhramit ho jate the yadi unki sidhi baat duusare ko pareshaan kar detii thi
 People remember finmen differently - some people, sambhavat: sabase zyada log unhen us vyakti kii tarah se yaad karte hai jisane tivi ke saamne saarvajanik rup se bataaya ki chalanger-durghatana kyon hui
 On 28 January 1986, a commissioner was set up to investigate the Challenger spaceship exploded in the sky

 The explosion was caused by the installation of some substandard goods in the spaceship
 nasa kaa prashasan ise dabaanaa chahta tha par vaigyanik ise ujagar karnaa chaahate the
 The commission began airing its findings in front of TV
 us samay tivi par hi, sabake saamne finemen ne ekadam thande pani ke andar ghatiya saamaan ko daal kar dikhaaya ki vastav main visphot kyon hua tha
 It was a live telecast, so the performance of The Finemen could not be stopped, and this two-minute clip became the world's most played news clip within a few hours
 finemen pisadina main aksar vahiin ke ek restaraan me jate the, jahaan par toplace pariveshikaayen rahati thim
 In that restaurant, he used to tell his master the physics and he was painting them
 ek baar police waalon ko laga ki us restaraan main kuch gadabad- sadabad hota he or restaraan ke maalik par ashleelata kaa mukadmaa chalaaya
 In fact, there was no such work
 us restaraan main kai pratishthit vyakti aate the restaraan ke maalik ne un sabase gavaahi dene kii prarthana kii
 Everybody cut the trench with silence, but the finemen did not
 unhone restaraan maalik ke paksh main gavaahi di or agle din akhabaaron ke pehle panne par sabase mukhya khabar ke rup main chhapi

 taash ke ek deck se anek prakaar ke pattey ke khel khele ja sakate hai, unamem se kuch jua main bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 Since playing cards are standardized and generally available, they are also being used for other uses, such as hand cleaning, prediction, cryptography, board games, or house building cards

 Playing cards were found in China during the Tang Dynasty in the early 9th century, when relatives of a princess played a "leaf game"
 tang lekhak su i ne kaha he ki tang ke samraat yijong kii beti rajkumaari tongchang samay kaatane ke liye vei kul ke sadasyon ke saath lif game khelaa karti thi
 According to Song dynasty scholar Ouyang Xiu, the playing of cards has existed since the Middle Tang dynasty, and with this invention he added the simultaneous development of the use of pages in place of paper rolls
 The book, named Yezi Gexi, is reportedly written by a Tang era woman and has been commented upon by authors of later dynasties

 Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma was a well-known critic, essayist, thinker and poet of modern Hindi literature
 vyavsaay se angreji ke professor, dil se hindi ke prakand pandit or mahaan vichaarak, rugveda or marks ke adhyeta, kavi, aalochak, itihaasavetta, bhashavid, raajnneeti-vishaarad ye sab visheshan un par samaan rup se lagu hote hai
 Born in Unchagaon Sani of Unnao district, Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma received his MA in English from Lucknow University
 He did it and started teaching there temporarily
 1940 main vahiin se pi-ech
di
 kii oopaadhi main praapt kii
 Since 1943, he has taught in the English Department at Balwant Rajput College, Agra and was the President of the English Department
 1971-74 tak kanhaiyalaal maanik munshi hindi viapeeth, agra main nideshak pad par rahe
 Retired in 1974
 dow ramvilas sharma ke saahitiyik jivan kaa aarambh 1934 se hota he jab vah sooryakanth treepathi 'niraala' ke sampark main aaye
 In the same year, he wrote his first critical article 'poetry of Niralaji' which was published in the famous magazine 'chand'
 iske baad ve nirantar srijan kii ore unmukh rahe
 After Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma is established as a critic who puts language, literature and society together and assesses it
 unki aalochana prakriya main keval sahitya hi nahin hota, balki ve samaaj, arth, raajnneeti, itihaas ko ek saath lekar sahitya kaa moolyankan karte hai
 Like other critics, he has not evaluated a creator merely to test his writing skills, but his criterion of how judged the creator has been over his time
 inamen se anek pustakon ke sanshodhit-parivarddhit sanskaran baad main prakashit hue hai, unhen hi padhanaa chahie
 All these books are now published from Rajkamal, Vani, Kitabghar, Hindi Medium Implementing Directorate, Sahitya Akademi and Sahitya Bhandar publications
 aise saamaanya pathak jo pramukh chuninda anshon ko hi padhanaa chahen, unke liye sarvottam sankalan he 'sankalit nibandh' Special issues of several magazines focused on Sharma ji have been published, in which available and special readings are - hindi jati kii avadharana ramvilas sharma ke jaateey chintan kaa kendriya bindu he
 Through comparative study of Indian literature and interaction with global literature, Ramvilas ji has identified the progressive role of ethnic elements of literature
 acharya ramchandra shukla ke baad dow ramvilas sharma hi ek aise aalochak ke rup main sthapit hote hai, jo bhashaa, sahitya or samaaj ko ek saath rakhkar moolyankan karte hai
 In their criticism process, there is not only literature, but they evaluate literature by taking society, meaning, politics, history together
 anya aalochakon kii tarah unhone kisi rachanaakaar kaa moolyankan keval lekhkeey kaushal ko jaanchne ke liye nahin kiya he, balki unke moolyankan kii kasuti yah hoti he ki us rachanaakaar ne apane samay ke saath kitna nyaay kiya he
 Tackling with the problems of history as if his first vow
 ve bhartiya itihaas kii har samasya kaa nidaan khojane main jute rahe
 He was opposed when he said that Aryans are native to India
 unhone kaha ki arya pashchim asia yaa kisi duusare sthaan se bharat main nahin aae hai, balki sach yah he ki ve bharat se pashchim asia kii ore gaye hai
 He writes - "the second millennium BC is the millennium of major mass campaigns
 isi dauraan bhartiya aaryon ke dal iraq se lekar turki tak fail jate hai
 They leave the impression of their language and culture everywhere
 poonjeewaadi itihaaskaaron ne ulti ganga bahaai he
 The era which is the exit of the Aryans, they are called the era of their entry into India
 iske saath hi ve yah prayaas karte hai ki pashchim asia ke vartmaan nivaasiyon kii aankhon se unki pracheen samskruti kaa vah paksh ojhal rahe, jiskaa sambandh bharat se he
 First of all, Indians have to understand this relationship, then they have to explain it to their neighbors
 bhukhmaree, ashiksha, andhvishwaas or nae-nae rog failaane vaali vartmaan samaaj vyavastha ko badalanaa he
 This requires a concerted effort by India and its neighbors
 yah prayaas jab bhi ho, yah anivaary he ki tab padosiyon se hamaare vartmaan sambandh badalenge or unke badalane ke saath ve or ham apane puraane sambandhon ko nae sire se pahachaanenge
 The scientific, objective interpretation of the past is associated with the question of the reorganization of the present society
 ’’ The research work done by Ramvilasji on the prevalence of Indian culture in West Asia and Europe, in this work he has taken the support of dance, history, philology
 shabdon kii sanrachana or unki utpatti kaa vishleshan kar ve is nishkarsh par pahonchte hai ki aaryon kii bhashaa kaa gaharaa prabhaav europe or pashchim asia kii bhashaaon par he
 He writes - "in 1786, the Greek, Latin and Sanskrit scholar William Jones said," Sanskrit is more complete than Greek
 latin kii apeksha adhik samrudh he or donon main kisi kii bhi apeksha adhik sucharu rup se parishkrut he
 'but it has such a deep connection with both verbs and grammar forms, that it cannot happen accidentally
 yah sambandh sachmuch hi itnaa suspasht he ki koi bhi bhashashasthri in teenon kii pariksha karne par yah vishwaas kiye bina nahin rah saktaa ki ve ek hi strot se janme hai
 The source is probably no longer extant
 iske baad ek strot bhashaa kii shakhaon ke rup main german, slav, kelt aadi bhashaa mudraon ko milakar ek vishaal indo european parivaar kii dharna prastut kii gai
 Comparative and historical linguistics have made enormous progress in the first half of the 19th century
 anek nai-puraani bhashaaon ke apane vikaas tathaa parsparik sambandhon kii jaankaree ke alaava bahut se deshon ke pracheen itihaas ke bare main jo dharanaayen prachlit hai, ve isi aitihaasik bhashaa vigyaan kii dein hai
 Initially, scholars of Europe believed that the source language that gave rise to their languages has a deep connection with India
 yah manyata marks ke ek bharat sambandhi lekh main bhi he
 '' angrejon ke prabhutv se bhartiya janata kii mukti kii kaamana karte hue unhone 1833 main likhaa tha, ‘‘ham nishchaypurvak, newnaadhik sudur avadhi main us mahaan or dilachasp desh ko punerjeevit hote dekhne kii aashaa kar sakate hai, jahaan ke sajjan nivasee rajkumaar saltikove ke shabdon main italian logon se adhik chatur or kushal hai, jinaki adheenta bhi ek shant garima se santulit rahati he, jinhone apane sahaj aalasy ke baavjood angrej afasaron ko apni veerta se chakit kar diya he, jinka desh hamaari bhashaaon, hamaare dharmon kaa udgam he or jahaan pracheen german kaa swaroop jati main, pracheen yunaan kaa swaroop brahyan main pratibimbit he
 '' dow ramvilas sharma marxvaadi drushti se bhartiya sandarbhon kaa moolyankan karte hai, lekin ve in mulyon par swayan to gaurav karte hi hai, saath hi apane pathakon ko nirantar bataate hai ki bhashaa or sahitya tathaa chintan kii drushti se bharat atyant pracheen raashtra he
 They consider Indian history written by the British to be a conspiracy
 unka kahana he ki yadi bharat ke itihaas kaa sahi-sahi moolyankan karnaa he to hamen apane pracheen granthon kaa adhyayan karnaa hoga
 The British have deliberately destroyed Indian history
 aisa karke hi ve is mahaan raashtra par raaj kar sakate the
 The deeper manifestation of the separation of caste and religion prevalent in India after the arrival of the British, the impact is not as deep in the history
 samaaj ko baantkar hi angrej is mahaan raashtra par shashan kar sakate the or unhone vahi kiya bhi he
 He never accepted the awards received
 un raashiyon ko hindi ke vikaas main lagane ko kaha
 2012-2013 was the birth centenary year of Ram Vilas Sharma
 ramvilas sharma ke upar apana vyaakhyaan dete huye vir bharat talwaar ne kaha tha ki ramvilas sharma kii mrityu ne hindi media ko jhakzor kar rakh diya tha
 They say- isse ham ramvilas sharma kii lokapriyata or unke jane se hue kshati donon kaa anumaan laga sakate hai

 is prakaar prakrutivaadee aatma-paramatma, spasht prayojan ityadi kii satta main vishwaas nahin karte hai
 Pro
 Sørle's view is that naturalism is an ideology according to which the power of natural or creation cannot be given to the human body
 prakrutwad sabhyataa kii jatilta kii pratikriya ke falswaroop samaaj ke sammukh upasthit hua
 Philosophers have differed regarding the meaning of 'nature'
 adams ke anusaar yah shabd atyant jatil he jisaki aspashtataa ke kaaran hi anek bhoolen hoti hai
 'prakriti' can be explained in three ways
 pratham arth main prakruti kaa taatpary us vishesh gun se he jo maanav jivan ko vikaas evam unnati kii ore le jane main sahaayak hote hai
 Rousseau was first introduced to this meaning of nature
 jiske aadhaar par da
 haal ne ‘bal kendrit shiksha’ kaa swaroop viksit kiya
 Therefore, in the first sense, nature refers to human nature
 ‘prakruti’ kaa dwitiya arth ‘banaavat ke thik vipareet’ bataaya gaya
 That is, the work in which man has not cooperated is natural
 ‘prakruti’ ke tisare arth ke anusaar ‘samast vishwa’ hi prakruti he tathaa shiksha ke anusaar iskaa taatpary vishwa kii kriya kaa adhyayan tathaa use jivan main utaarne se he
 Some scholars believe that human beings should not become a hindrance in the evolutionary chain of nature
 apitu use alag hi rahanaa chaiye
 Since development cannot happen without a person, a person cannot function without purpose, therefore some scholars believe that this law of development should be studied and become a follower of nature
 is prakaar spasht he ki ‘prakruti’ ke arth ke sambandh main mataiky nahin he
 According to ancient theory, the way in which a person can attain more values in life is to establish as close a relationship with nature as possible
 yah vichaar democrits, epicuras tathaa lucritius ke vichaaron se samya rakhte hai
 All these scholars generally wished to achieve such a life which is free from all possible pains and pains
 adhikansh prakrutivaadiyon ne sarvocch shrey kaa vivechan karte hue use shreshth evam shaashvat sukh mana he
 On this basis, it can be said that the ethics of naturalism is hedonistic
 'prakruti' ke arth ke sambandh main darshanikon main matbhed rahaa he
 Adams says that the term is very complex, due to the ambiguity of which many mistakes occur
 prakruti ko 3 prakaar se spasht kiya ja saktaa he- This ideology is based on material science
 iske anusaar samast prakruti main anu vidyaman he
 The world is composed of these elements
 jeev or man sabhi kaa nirmaan bhautik tatwon ke sanyog se hua he
 Material science studies only the laws of external nature and interprets each of the facts of experience on the basis of these rules
 atah prakruti ke niyam sarvopari hai
 It also tries to understand human beings according to the laws of material science
 iskaa manushya kii aantarik prakruti se koi prayojan nahin he kintu shiksha ek maanviya prakriya he jiskaa sambandh maanav kii aantarik prakruti se he
 Hence, naturalism of matter science has no special contribution in the field of education
 is sampradaay ke anusaar sristi yantravat he jo padaarth or gati se nirmit he
 There is no purpose, purpose or spiritual power in this lifeless machine
 maanav yadhyapi is jagat kaa sarvshereshth praani he tathaapi usamen swachetana nahin hota, uskaa vyavhaar vahya prabhaavo ke kaaran niyantrit hota he
 As the human comes in contact with the external environment, the human machine keeps on functioning smoothly
 manushya kii prayojanshiltaa, kriyaatmakataa uske atmik gunon kii vivechna is vichaardhaara main sambhav nahin he
 The position of the animal, the position of the device and the position of the human is the difference between the three
 atah manushya kii shiksha bhinn prakaar se honi chahie
 Therefore mechanistic naturalism has no special contribution in the field of education
 yah vichaardhaara ‘vikaas ke siddhanth’ main vishwaas rakhti he
 Therefore, this ideology originated from the evolutionary theory of Darwin
 is mat ke anusaar jeevon ke kram vikaas main manushya sabase antim avasthaa main he
 It is due to brain development that man developed language, as a result of which he can store knowledge
 naye vichaar utpann kar saktaa he tathaa saamaajik evam saanskrithik jivan kaa vikaas kar paaya he
 Man is not different from other beings in all other respects
 uski niyati tathaa vikaas kii sambhaavnaayen vanshakram tathaa parivesh par nirbhar karti hai
 There is no such thing as will power
 vastav main is prakrutwad se manushya kii purv sthiti kaa gyaan kiya ja saktaa he
 But even his future ideals cannot be imagined
 yah kami hote hue bhi is prakrutwad kaa shiksha main yogadan mana ja saktaa he
 Naturalism is a philosophical ideology that considers matter to be the basis and reality and the world, creatures and human beings are all created from it
 is vichaardhaara ke pramukh pravartak ke rup main saamanytah ruso kaa hi naam liya jaataa he
 Although Russo strongly raised the slogan of naturalism, he was also influenced by ideological philosophers like Plato
 uske vichaar platon se prabhavit the
 So the nature of Rousseau's naturalism seems to be built on the background of idealistic objectives
 brubekar kaa aisa vichaar he ki ruso ek romantic prakrutivaadee tha
 We cannot call Russians naturalists on the basis of the interests and qualifications of the child, away from bondage, system of education at the natural site, etc
 kyonki yadi maatr balak kii swaabhaavik ruchi par bal dene tathaa prakruti se prem ke bal par yadi ruso ko prakrutivaadee kaha ja saktaa he to hamen plato ko bhi isi shrenee main sammilit karnaa hoga
 Philosophers like Rusk, Donald Butler, etc
 believe that Herbert Spencer is indeed a naturalist
 bekan evam camenius bhi prakrutivaadee vichaardhaara se jude prathit hote hai
 However, Spencer and the Russians can only be credited for bringing naturalism to its peak
 ruson ke sambandh main aashcharya vyakt karte hue rabart harbart ne likhaa he ki ruso jaise patit vyakti kaa itnaa prabhaav aashcharya janak he
 Since the Russians were also a part of the corrupt society, it was bound to be a moral fall
 atah ruso ne tatkaaleen samaaj ke vishay main saarvbhaumik kathan kah daalaa, - ‘manushya kii santhaayen virdohi tatwon evam bhuulon kaa pind he
 And by working against the rules established by the society, the right work will be possible
 ’ ruson ne ‘prakruti kii ore lauto’ kaa jo naaraa diya usase yahi sanket nikalataa he ki vah chaatro ko dooshit samaaj se dur gaanv kii prakritik chhatra chaaya main le janaa chahta tha
 In fact, this 'debate' took place as a result of the 'revolution' taking place in the social, economic, religious and educational fields of 18th century Europe
 yah kranti vishesh rup se tatkaaleen roodhiwaadita evam andh vishwaason se grasit dharmik sansthaaon ke viruddh hui thi
 Mechanical naturalism gave rise to behavioral psychology according to which every human being is born with some spontaneous actions
 jab ye sahaj kriyaayein bahya paryaavaran ke sampark main aati hai to sambaddh sahaj kriyaaon kaa nirmaan hota he ye sambaddh sahaj kriya manushya ko vibhinn kaary main sahaayta pradaan karti hai
 Therefore mechanistic naturalists believe that the aim of education is to generate appropriate and useful related spontaneous actions in humans
 jeev vigyaan ke siddhanton main vishwaas rakhane vaale prakrutivaadiyon ke anusaar shiksha kaa charam lakshya sukh evam anand kii prapti karana he kintu macdugal mahoday ne yah siddh kiya tha ki ham mul pravritiyon ke kaaran kaary karte hai, sukh dukh to pratifal hai
 Therefore, the aim of education is to transform and refine the basic trends, so that a new harmony can be created by redirection and integration of the student's tendencies so that he can conduct in a manner which is compatible with social and moral values
 jeevigyaanvaadiyon ke anusaar prayek praani main jeene kii ichha hoti he
 And to protect his life he always has to struggle with his environment
 darwin ne is sambandh main do siddhanth diye hai - jivan ke sangharsh tathaa samarth kaa astitv
 Therefore, Darwin wants to make man powerful and powerful, so that he can achieve success in the life struggle
 kintu lamark ke anusaar vaataavaran ke anuroop parivartan sheeltaa ke gunon keeshiksha dena hi uchit uddeshy he
 People like Bernard Shaw want to accelerate the evolutionary pace of nature
 isliye saamaajik athwa jaateey viraasat ke rup main praapt samskruti ko ek peedi se duusari peedi tak pahunchaana tathaa unka sangrakshan karnaa shiksha kaa uddeshy nirdhaarit kiya he
 According to the principle of happiness and sorrow, a man does things that are pleasurable and tries to avoid those who give grief
 yah baat sahi nahin he kyonki manushya kabhi kabhi kartavya ke liye praan bhi de detaa he
 In this regard, T
P
 The idea of the nun sir seems more expedient
 yadhyapi nan mahoday adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke adhik samarthak hai kintu shiksha ke uddeshy ke sambandh main unhone jeev vaigyanik evam prakrutivaadee drushtikon se vichaar kiya he
 According to him, the main objective of education is to develop the human personality independently
 nan ke anusaar vaiyaktikta se taatpary aatmanubhuti or aatm prakaashan he
 In this way, the aim of education is to help in the free and inhibited development of the innate powers inherent in the individual
 is sambandh main do vichaar vyakt kiya jaataa he
 The proponents of the first idea are Woodsworth, according to which the child comes from heaven in luminous form, but by coming here he loses his glory, because he is an ignorant child
 isliye uske vartmaan sukhon se yukt shiksha kaa prabandh hona chahie
 The second idea is that of people like Jeremiah etc
 who consider the child to be the cause of sin and only by keeping him in strict discipline, ending his natural instincts is the method of education and aiming to be God-oriented
 kintu is vichaar ko adhik mahatv nahin diya ja saktaa he kyonki yah vichaar pashavik prathit hota he
 According to this ideology, the education of a child should be dependent on his nature, at whose core lies primitive emotion, fundamental desires and natural attitudes
 vaastavik shiksha to vah he jo balak kii ruchi, yogyata evam jhukaav ke anuroop ho
 Discipline and bonding should be of little name to the child
 prakrutivaadee balak ko vastutah nirmanonmukh maanav maanate hai na ki use maanav kaa ek laghu rup
 His nature continues to evolve
 isliye sabhi ko in uddeshyon kii purti kii ore hi vishesh dhyaan dena chaiye
 The narrative of the naturalist curriculum comes from Spencer's book
 unke paathyakram kii visheshta yah he ki sampoorn paathyakram kaa aadhaar vigyaan mana gaya he
 According to Spencer, it is possible to live a holistic life only through science
 samgr jivan ke uddeshy kii purti ke liye spencer ne nimnlikhit paathyakram prastut kiya he
 Teachers used to be active in the ancient learning method
 baalkon kaa sthaan gaun tha kintu balak kii kriyasheeltaa par adhik bal prakrutivaadiyon ne diya
 They oppose the method of rote and passive practice and emphasize the use of methods based on the principles of 'learning by doing' and 'learning by experience'
 iske atirikt prakrutivaadee vichaardhaara ne project methd, scout, aandolan, skool union, balak club ityadi ko janm diya
 Naturalists pay special importance to the following principles of teaching method: prakrutivaadee shiksha main shikshak ko gaun sthaan praapt he
 Naturalist thinkers consider nature to be the real teacher
 unke vichaar se balak ko samaaj se dur rakhkar prakritik vaataavaran main shiksha praapt karne kaa avasar dena chahie
 According to the Russians, the influence of society's misgivings on the teacher is so much that even if he tries to make his children virtuous, he cannot make them virtuous because he himself is not virtuous
 isliye ruson balak kii aarmabhik shiksha main shikshak ko koi sthaan nahin dena chaahate
 Other naturalists do not accept the excesses of Rousseau
 ve baalkon kii shiksha main shikshak kii bhoomika maatr sahaayak evam path pradarshak ke rup main maanate hai
 Therefore teacher should have knowledge of psychology
 balak kii manokamanaayen, aavashyaktaaen ruchiyaan tathaa unke maansik vikaas kaa use parigyaan hona chahie
 It is necessary for the teacher to know the self-spontaneous actions of the child
 kyonki chaatr in swatah shaktiyon dwaara apni shiksha swayan karata he, shikshak to keval uchit paristhitiyon kaa sangyojan maatr karata he
 If the learning result is pleasant, then the child enjoys learning
 tathaa ukt shaikshik anubhav kii baar baar aavriti karata he
 The teacher is expected to create a customized environment for the child
 ruso ke anusaar skool swayan ek vishesh prakaar kaa samaaj he
 By this society, children are made worthy of future society
 isi samaaj dwaara vah swanushasan kii bhaavana sikhta he
 Prepares itself to lead and fulfill naturalistic objectives
 is prakaar ke schuli samaaj kaa bandhan kathor nahin hota
 Although Russo imagines a student and a teacher in the school
 saamanytah prakrutivaadee kisi prakaar se aupchaarik shiksha kaa virodh karte hai, isiilie isamen vidhyalay ko koi mahatvapurn sthaan na dekar baalkon ko dooshit vaataavaran se dur or prakritik vaataavaran ke bich rahakar shiksha praapt karne ko kaha gaya he
 It is because of these ideas that naturalist thinkers do not want schools to have institutions with artificial rigid and firm bonds
 prakrutivaadiyon ke anusaar skool main paathyakram evam sahagaami kriyaaon ityadi se sambandhit vishyon kii vyavastha main baalkon kaa bhi pratinidhitiv aavashyak hota he
 Therefore, they should be given the freedom to arrange their own programs for excursion, traveling, sports, scouting, social service etc
 shikshakon ko keval path pradarshak kii bhoomika kaa nirvahan karnaa chahie
 Naturalist thinkers do not value discipline in education
 ve ‘kaaran evam parinaam’ ke niyam main vishwaas karte hai
 According to him, every person who performs karma, he surely suffers the result
 ye parinaam sukhkar evam dukhakar donon hi hote hai
 On this basis, two bye-laws of discipline appear - ruso ke siddhanth ke anusaar balak ke bure kaaryon kaa dand prakruti avashya detii he
 Therefore, he should not be allowed to be disciplined by natural punishment by giving any kind of punishment, while according to the principle of Spencer, the child wants to repeat the pleasurable works again and again
 kyonki usase use sukh kii anubhuti hoti he jabaki vah dukhad kaaryon ko chhod detaa he, kyonki usase use ksht hota he
 In this way, the child starts behaving in a disciplined manner and a sense of self-discipline starts developing in him
 kuch prakrutivaadee vichaarak shiksha vyavastha main anushaasan kii sthapana hetu kisi bhi prakaar ke ‘damanaatmak siddhanth’ kaa virodh karte hai
 He believes that teachers especially have an impact on children
 isliye baalkon main anushaasan kii bhaavana viksit karne hetu ‘prabhavatmak siddhanth kaa sahaara lenaa chahie, jabaki anek prakrutivaadee vichaarak yah maanate hai ki anushaasan kii sthapana prakritik niyamon ke anusaar ho to zyada acha hota he
 On this basis, it can be said that the naturalists lay special emphasis on 'free radical theory' for the development of self-governance among children
