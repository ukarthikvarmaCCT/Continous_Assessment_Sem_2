 In the modern period, Dekart came to notice that the reason for the failure of the effort is that philosophers have been carrying on some advance imaginations
 darshanashastra ko ganit kii nischitata tabhi praapt ho sakati he, jab yah kisi dharna ko, jo swat:siddh nahin, pramanit kiye bina na maane
 He started with widespread skepticism
 uski apni chetana use aisi vastu dikhaai di, jiske astitv main andeh hi nahin ho saktaa : andeh to apane aap chetana kaa ek aakaar yaa swaroop he
 On this foundation he, in his view, proved the existence of the divine and the creation
 dekart kii vivechan-vidhi nai thi, parantu purvajon kii tarah uskaa anuraag bhi tatvagyan main hi tha
 John Locke chose a new route for himself
 sadiyon se sat ke vishay main vivaad hota rahaa he
 First, it is necessary to know how far our knowledge reaches
 isi se ye prashn bhi jude the ki gyaan kya he or kaise praapt hota he
 The philosophers of the continent of Europe sought to replicate the philosophy of mathematics, Locke turned his attention to psychology and composed an "essay on human intelligence"
 yah ugantkaari pustak siddh hui, ise anubhavvaad kaa muladhar samajha jaataa he
 George Berkeley advanced empiricism by writing the rules of "anthropology" in Locke's criticism, and David Hume took it to the extreme in "human nature"
 hum ke vichaaron kaa vishesh mahatv yah he ki unhone kaant ke "aalochanavaad" ke liye maarg khol diya

 It was never ignored in India

 Dekart started by analyzing his experience, but man is a social animal, his experience does not develop into a vacuum
 darshanashastra kaa itihaas vadavivaad kii katha he
 Plato expressed his opinion in dialogues
 samvaad main ek se adhik chetnaaon kaa astitv sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 In Jnanamimamsa, the subject of deliberation becomes not a personal consciousness, but a social consciousness
 gyaan kaa apana astitv to asandigdh he parantu isamen nimnlikhit sweekrutiyaan bhi nihit hoti hai- A
 Knowledge is different from knowledge, which is knowledge

 But epistemology cannot accept this claim without proper investigation
 ham abhi in dharanaon kii pariksha karenge, parantu pehle gyaan ke swaroop par kuch kahana aavashyak he
 The main questions in Jnanamimamsa are- gyaan kaa swaroop : sammati, vishwaas or gyaan jab ham kisi dharna ko sunate hai yaa uskaa chintan karte hai to us sabandh main hamaari vritti is prakaar kii hoti he - There are several levels of acceptance
 adham str par samayik sweekruti he, ise sammati kehete hai
 This acceptance is not certified, if we have to renounce it, we have no disgust

 In order to live in religious beliefs, human beings bear all kinds of suffering
 vishwaas or sammati donon vaiyaktik kritiyaan hai, gyaan main yah parisemen nahin hota

 ye to aise tathy hai, jinhen prayek buddhivant praani ko avashya maananaa hota he sanmatiyo main bhed hota he gyaan sabake liye ek he
 In the knowledge, the subjectivity of acceptance takes the place of objectivity
 anubhavvaad ke anusaar, gyansaamagree ke do hi bhaag hai -- prabhaav or unke bimb
 There is no knowledge of these for matter
 hum ne kaha ki jis tarah bhautik padaarth gunsamooh ke atirikt kuch nahin, usee tarah anbhavi anubhavon ke samooh ke atirikt kuch nahin
 There is a distinction between these two groups - all the properties of the clan exist together, the conscious states of consciousness appear one after the other
 chetana shrenee yaa pankti he or kisi pankti ko apane aap pankti hone kaa bodh nahin ho saktaa
 There is no place for remembrance in the interpretation of the heart; As William James said, empiricism requires memory
 hum ko gyaata gyansaamagree main nahin mila; vah vahaan mil hi nahin saktaa tha
 The question for empiricism was - what does experience tell? Back Kant asked - How does experience become? Experience cannot exist without the action of the experienced
 manushya saamaajik praani he; hamaara sara jivan or manushyon ke saath vyateet hota he
 Pursuit is a widespread acceptance
 mimasaa ke liye prashn yah he ki is sweekruti kii sthiti drudh vishwaas kii sthiti he yaa gyaan kii? is vishay main swapn andeh kaa kaaran he
 In a dream, i seem to hear; Interaction with other humans also appears to occur
 kya jaagran or swapn kaa bhi swapn kii pratiti to nahin? ahamvaad ke anusaar sari satta baari kalpana hi he
 Our social life is a refutation of egoism, but the question is only in relation to social life - is this life not just faith? There is no evidence against egoism that can be called unbroken
 jab ham aise andeh se grast hote hai to, jaisaa hum ne kaha he, thode samay ke baad ham apane aapako thakaa pate hai or hamaara dhyaan vivash hokar duniya kii ore phirata he, jisamen bhautik padaarth bhi hai or chetan praani bhi

 ise pratibodh yaa pratyaksh bhi kehete hai
 In such a sense the subject of knowledge is outside the knower; Reflections and suffixes occur inside
 yah baahar or andar kaa bhed kalpana maatr he yaa tathy he, gyanamimasaa main yah pramukh prashn rahaa he
 No other question in Jnanamimansa has attracted as much attention as the Enlightenment or direct knowledge has attracted
 sankhya darshan ke anusaar pratyaksh ke do pramukh chihn hai -- Direct senses and subject interaction result
 pratyaksh main chitt vishay ke aakaar ko grahan kar letaa he
 This means that direct knowledge is not imaginable and there is no misconception in it
 yah to spasht hi he ki hamaare paas pratyaksh se adhik vishwast gyaan nahin, parantu prashn yah he ki vishayi or vishay main sidhaa sampark ho bhi saktaa he yaa nahin
 If such contact occurs, how is the confusion entered? There is some difference between subject and subject

 The trees of the forest do not look green from afar, because along with their color, the color of the air falling in the middle is also found
 phir, hamaari indriya kii avasthaa bhi ek si nahin rahati, kaan kaa rogi padaarthon ko pilaa dekhtaa he
 Some thinkers say that we do not look at external substances, look at their pictures, cannot say with certainty about these pictures that they correspond to external substances; There is always a possibility of confusion here
 vastavvaad ke do rup hai -- saakshatatmak vastavvaad or pratibimbaatmak vastavvaad
 In the first form the existence of the illusion becomes a problem, in the second form true knowledge is not solved
 vigyaanavaad andar or baahar ke bhed ko samaapt kar detaa he
 Its seed existed in the thoughts of John Locke
 usne kaha ki dravya kaa pratyay aspasht he
 He also said that the main qualities of physical substances are present in them, but the secondary qualities are the results which are expressed in our mind by the trauma of the principal qualities
 barkale ne kaha ki jo yuktiyaan apradhan gunon ke vastugat astitv ke viruddh di jaati hai, vahi pradhan gunon ke viruddh di jaati he
 There is nothing outside, the question of whether its perception is clear or unclear has become a suffix

 These are different from the knower, beyond him and he has an independent existence
 rassla ke anusaar, "indriyagrahyon" ke samooh vidyaman hai, inke kuch ansh gruhit ho jate hai
 Our understanding is true knowledge, but partial knowledge
 kaant ne apni vikhyath pustak "shuddh buddhi kii samalochna" ko in shabdon ke saath aarambh kiya -- "there can be no doubt that all our knowledge begins with experience
 kyonki yah kaise sambhav he ki bodh shakti kuch karne lage, sivaay iske ki hamaari indriyon ko prabhavit karanevaale padaarth ise yah kshamta den
 But although all our knowledge begins with experience, this does not conclude that all knowledge is the result of experience

 Even doing this, he said in the beginning that our thoughts cannot go beyond the world of revelations

 prayek nirnay satya hone kaa daawa karata he
 What is the meaning of this claim? nirnay main do pratyayon yaa vichaaron ke sambandh kii baat kahi jaati he
 If this relationship also exists in the substances that are the origin of those ideas, then the decision is true
 satya kaa yah samaadhaan anurupatavaad kehalaata he
 Scientism calls the external world as fiction, according to which there is nothing but consciousness and conscious states in power

 This is antisemitism

 According to this, the notion that proves successful in practice is true
 satya koi sthaayee vastu nahin, jise ham dekhte hai; yah banataa he

 Middle Oceanian languages or fijian-polynesian languages are a subdivision of the branch of the Ossian language family called middle-eastern Oceanian

 antarrashtriya vyapaar, antarrashtriya simaaon yaa kshetron ke aar-paar puunji, maal or sevaaon kaa aadan-pradaan he
 
 In most countries, it represents a significant fraction of GDP
 jabaki antarrashtriya vyapaar, itihaas ke adhikansh bhaag main maujuud rahaa he iskaa aarthik, saamaajik or raajnneetik mahatv haal kii sadiyon main badhane laga he
 Industrialization, advanced transport, globalization, multinational corporations and outsourcing have all had a wide impact on the international trade system
 vaishvikaran kii nirantarata ke liye antarrashtriya vyapaar main badhotaree mahatvapurn he
 Without international trade, countries will be limited to goods and services produced within their own borders
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, siddhant rup main gharelu vyapaar se bhinn nahin he kyonki ek vyapaar main shaamil pakshon kii abhiprerana or vyavhaar moulik rup se badalata nahin he bhale hi vyapaar seemaa paar kaa ho yaa nahin
 The main difference is that international trade is generally more expensive than domestic trade
 iskaa kaaran he ki ek seemaa aam taur par atirikt shulk lagaati he jaise prashulk, seemaa par vilamb ke kaaran aavadhik laagat or bhashaa, kanoonee pranali yaa samskruti jaise deshiy bhinnataaon se judi laagtein
 Another difference between domestic and international trade is that production factors such as capital and labor are generally more dynamic within countries than outside
 is prakaar antarrashtriya vyapaar zyaadaatar maal or sevaaon ke vyapaar tak simit he or puunji, shram yaa utpaadan ke anya karkon ke vyapaar main keval ek chote paimaane par
 iske alaava maal or sevaaon kaa vyapaar, utpaadan karkon main vyapaar ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main kaary kar saktaa he
 Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of the factor of production and thus include the related factor
 An example is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China
 Rather than importing Chinese labor, the US is importing goods from China that are produced using Chinese labor
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, arthshaastra kii ek shakha bhi he, jo antarrashtriya vitt ke saath milakar antarrashtriya arthshaastra kii vistrut shakha kaa nirmaan karti he
 Several different models have been proposed to forecast the methodology of trade and to analyze the impact of trade policies such as tariffs
 ricardian model tulanaatmak laabh par kendrit he or antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main shaayad sabase mahatvapurn avadharana he
 In a Ricardian model, countries specialize in the production of the things they produce well
 anya modelon ke vipareet, ricardian dhaancha purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, maal kii ek vistrut shrunkhlaa kaa utpaadan karne ke bajaay visheshgy honge
 In addition, the Ricardian model does not directly consider factor funds, such as the relative amount of labor and capital within a country
 The major advantage of the Ricardin model is that it visualizes technology variations between countries
 praudyogiki antar, ricardian or ricardo-srapha model main aasaani se shaamil hota he 
 The Ricardian model makes the following assumptions: ricardian model laghu-avadhi main maapan karata he, isliye praudyogiki antarrashtriya str par bhinn hoti he
 This supports the fact that countries follow their comparative advantage and allow for specialization
 ricardian vyapaar model kaa adhyayan graham, jones, mekenzi or anya dwaara kiya gaya
 All principles excluded trade input goods such as intermediate goods, commodities and capital goods
 mekenji, jones or samuelson ne jor diya ki vyapaar se madhyavarti vastuon ko baahar rakhe jane se kaaphi laabh kho jayega
 ek prasiddh tippanee main mekenji ne kaha ki "ek pal kaa vichaar ek vyakti ko samajha degaa ki sooti kapade kaa utpaadan karne ke liye lankashair asambhavy hoga, yadi kapaas ko england main ugaana pade
 More recently, it expanded the theory to include the business intermediate case as well
 is prakaar "keval shram" dharna siddhant se nikaal di gai
 Thus the new Ricardian theory, sometimes named the ricardo-sraffa model, theoretically includes capital goods such as machines and materials, traded between countries
 vaishvik vyapaar ke samay main, yah dharna heksher-olin model kii apeksha adhik yathartwaadee he, jo yah maanata he ki puunji, desh ke andar sthir he or antarrashtriya str par gatisheel nahin he
 In the early 1900s, two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Olin, created an international trade theory called the factor ratio theory
 is siddhant ko heksher-olin siddhant bhi kaha jaataa he
 The heckscher-olin theory emphasizes that countries should produce and export goods that require resources that are abundant and must import goods that require short-supply resources
 yah siddhant, tulanaatmak laabh or purna laabh ke siddhanton se bhinn he kyonki ye siddhant ek vishesh vastu ke liye utpaadan prakriya kii utpaadakta par kendrit hai
 In contrast, the heckscher-olin theory states that a country should specialize in production and export using factors that are most abundant and therefore cheap
 Do not produce those goods, as stated by earlier theories, which they produce most efficiently
 heksher-olin model ko buniyadi tulanaatmak laabh ke ricardian model ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Despite its greater complexity, it did not prove to be more accurate in its forecasts
 lekin ek saidhantik drushtikon se dekhne par yah antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main nav-shastreey mulya tantra ko shaamil karke ek suruchipurna samaadhaan pradaan karata he
 This theory argues that the pattern of international trade is determined by differences in factor funds
 yah purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, un maalon kaa niryaat karenge, jo sthaneey rup se prachur karkon kaa upyog karte hai or un maalon kaa aayaat karenge, jo aise karkon kaa upyog karte hai jo sthaneey rup se atyant alp hai
 Empirical problems with the HO model, known as the Leontief paradox, were encountered in empirical tests by Vasily Leontief, who found that the US was exporting labor-intensive goods despite the abundance of capital
 H-O model nimnlikhit mukhya dharanaen banaata he: The problem with HO theory is that it does not involve the trade of capital goods
 In HO theory, labor and capital are constant substances for each country
 ek aadhunik arthvyavastha main, puunjigat vastuon kaa antarrashtriya str par kaarobaar kiya jaataa he
 Trade in intermediate goods benefits greatly, as emphasized by Samuelson
 kai arthshaastri ricardo siddhant kii tulana main heksher-olin siddhant ko pasand karte hai, kyonki yah kam saral dharanaon ko banaata he
 In 1953, Vecily Leontief published a study where he tested the validity of the heckscher-olin theory
 The study showed that the US was more abundant in capital than other countries, so the US was exporting capital-intensive goods and importing labor-intensive goods
 Leontief found that US exports were less capital-intensive than imports
 leontiff virodhabhas ke ubharne ke baad, kai shodhakartaaon ne heksher-olin siddhant ko bachaane kii koshish kii, yaa to maapan ke nae tareekon dwaara, yaa nai vyakhyaaon ke dwaara

 Brecher and Choudary found that, if Leamer was right, the per capita consumption of American workers should be lower than the world average of workers' consumption
 baad main kai anya pareekshan hue lekin unamem se zyaadaatar asafal rahe
 Many well-known textbook authors, including Krugman and Obstfeld and Bowen, Hollander, and VN, are negative about the validity of the HO model
 
 anubhavjanya anusandhan ke lambey itihaas kaa pareekshan karne ke baad, boven, holender or vien ne nishkarsh diya: "kaarak bahutayat siddhant ke haal ke pareekshan jo sidhe HOV samikarnon kii jaanch karte hai, ve siddhant kii asweekruti kaa bhi sanket dete hai"
 :321 The Heckscher – Olin theory has not been well adapted to analyze south – north trade problems
 HO ke anumaan, N-N vyapaar kii tulana main N-S ke sambandh main kam yathartwaadee hai
 The income difference between North and South is the one thing the Third World cares the most
 kaarak mulya samakaran ne vasuuli kaa adhik sanket nahin dikhaaya he
 The HO model assumes that similar production functions between countries
 yah behad avastavik he
 Differentiation of technology between developed and developing countries is a major concern for poor countries
 is model main, udyogon ke bich shram gatishiltaa sambhav he, jabaki alpavadhi main udyogon ke bich puunji sthir he
 Thus, this model can be interpreted as a 'short-term' version of the Heckscher – Olin model
 vishisht kaarak naam, pradaan kiye jane vaale ke liye yah sandarbhit karata he ki alpavadhi main, bhautik puunji jaise utpaadan ke vishisht kaarak udyogon ke bich aasaani se antarneey nahin hai
 The theory suggests that if there is an increase in the price of the goods, then the owners of the factor of production in the specific context of that goods will have real good advantage
 iske alaava, virdohi utpaadan ke vishisht karkon ke maalikon ke paas virdohi kaarysoochee hone kii sambhaavna hoti jab ve shram ke apravas par niyantran ke liye paksh jutate hai
 In contrast, owners of both capital and labor benefit realistically from the increase in capital funds
 yah model vishesh udyogon ke liye adarsh he
 This model is ideal for understanding income distribution but is naïve to discuss the method of trade

 In the 19th century, especially in the United Kingdom, trust in free trade became paramount
 uske baad se yah dharna pashchimi deshon ke bich prabhavi soch ban gai
 In the years following World War II, controversial multilateral treaties such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization attempted to promote free trade by creating a globally regulated trade framework
 in vyapaar samjhauton ne, anuchit vyapaar ke daavon ke saath jo vikasshil deshon ke liye laabhadaayak nahin hai, aksar virodh or asantosh ko janm diya he
 Free trade is generally the most favored by the most economically strong countries, although they often engage in selective protectionism for industries that are strategically important, such as the US and Europe's imposition of agriculture
 a protective tariff
 The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were staunch advocates of free trade at the time when they were financially influential, today the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan being its biggest supporters
 haalanki, kai anya desh tezi se mukt vyapaar ke himachati banate ja rahe hai kyonki ve aarthik rup se khud adhik shaktishaalee ban rahe hai
 As the tariff level is declining, the desire to discuss non-tariff measures is also increasing, including foreign direct investment, recovery and trade facilitation
 Trade facilitation takes into account customs procedures and transaction costs related to carrying out trade

 During a recession, there is often excessive domestic pressure to increase tariffs to protect domestic industries

 Previous articles have discussed how international businesses need supporting ecosystems and business-friendly policies if they are to succeed in emerging markets

 Often, there is not an option for governments of many countries but they are also known as welcoming international businesses as they need "cash" or dollars
 udhaaharan ke liye, niryaat or aayaat ke bich ke antar ko chaalu khate ke ghate yaa siedi ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Since many emerging markets, the deficit is the ones that need funding with the dollar

 In addition, domestic industry capabilities may not be a particular area nor the expertise to be successful in developing that field
 isliye, epadiai ki kshetra ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he
 In addition, the opening of the economy is necessary for entry into the World Trade Organization or World Trade Organization, which means that in order to export to other countries, to open in emerging markets and developing economies
 in vajahon se vikasshil deshon main kai sarkarein apane-apane deshon main seoup ke sanchaalan ke liye antarrashtriya kaarobaar main videshi nivesh ko protsaahit karne or anumati dene ke kuch kar rahe hai
 However, a host of factors that do not continue the policies of the same governments include the ideological balance of governments, the compulsions of politics, and the fact that foreign investment may not succeed in kick-starting as a planned economy
 it depends on
 yahaan mahatvapurn pahalu yah he ki ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon ke kai sarkarein aksar kyonki uparokt kaarnon kaa khuli bahon se antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat he
 However, through the intervening process, some of them develop cold feet due to policy paralysis, and the factors listed above
 yah samajha ja saktaa he ki antarrashtriya kaarobaar ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon main pravesh karne kii ijaajat di dwidaleey arth he ki vahaan sabhi hitdharakon se is mudde par vyapak sahmati hona chahie hona chahie kii jarurat he
 Only then will international business succeed in emerging market economies
 iske alaava, videshi puunji ke liye pratispardhaa he ki kisi main prakriya par pratikul arthvyavastha or isliye, is prakriya ko jari rakhaa janaa chahie or kaaran protsaahan diya antarrashtriya kaarobaar ko prabhavit karte hai itani teevr he
 Finally, examples from China, Brazil, South Africa, and Vietnam demonstrate the need for a consensus on the opening of economies and following through on this process
 duusari ore, bharat or rus ke udhaaharan ke anya tareeke se in deshon khuli bahon ke saath majaburiyon ke kaaran unki arthvyavasthaaon ko kholaa or phir lekin gati ko banaae rakhane ke rup main asafal aasapaas hai

 vedavihit karm karne se karmbandhan swat: samaapt ho jaataa he - tasmanmumukshubhih kaary nityam naimittikan tathaa" aadi vachanon ke anusaar bhartiya aastik darshanon kaa mukhya praan mimasaa darshan he
 The Mimamsa philosophy is of sixteen chapters, with twelve chapters in order
 shastrasangati, adhyaysangati, padasngati or adhikarasangatiyon se susambaddha he
 What has been missed in these twelve chapters is represented in the remaining four chapters, which is famous as 'sankarsakand'
 usamen devtaa ke adhikaar kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Therefore, it is also called 'devata Kand' or can be called an appendix of two chapters
 bhaskar raay dikshit ne sankarshan cond kii vyakhya ke ant main likhaa he ki shodashadhai mimasaa ke rahete hue bhi pathnpathan madhya kaal main dwadashadhyay kaa hi hota tha
 Just as the scholarly class chants Tripada Gayatri even when Chatupada Gayatri is living, similarly in the present day, the study of Dwadashadhyayi Mimamsa is the only teaching
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar mimasaa ke bina vaakyarth kaa nirnay karnaa kathin he, kyonki amuk vaakya upasthit arth main pramaan he athwa anya arth main, is vichaar ke nirnay main jo nishkarsh aata he use mimasaa kaha gaya he, kintu yahan mimasaa shabd kaa arth darshan se he
 The idea of the meaning of non-contradictory Vedamantras for theology is called Mimamsa
 or vichaarpurvak praapt dharmagyaan mimasaa kaa fal he
 This is what Jamini has said in his philosophy of philosophy - that is, curiosity of religion

 Kumaril Bhatt described it as - aage vaakyarth nirnyopayogi sahasron nyaayon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Even six chapters have a brief theme
 is darshan main praptaprapt vivek nyaay se, athwa adagdh dahan nyaay se uddeshy vidhey bhav kaa vichaar kar veda-vaakyarth-nirnay se kartavya-akartavya kaa gyaan hota he
 Therefore, theology is the object of philosophy
 is darshan main dharmavichaar se upkram he
 Sanskrit literature is used in grammar for "grammar", grammatical justice, and "syntax" for epistemology
 is shaastra main hi dharmavichaar kii charchaa hai
 The main objective of the Indian public is religious worship
 anushthan fal ke bina nahin ho saktaa or falsaadhanta bhi saadhan saamagree ke bina nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, in short the means are also discussed
 anushthan ke purv dharm kaa lakshan, pramaan or saadhan fal jaananaa aavashyak he
 In this shastra, means, organs and balances are all three synonyms
 aise hi saadhy, sheshi or angi ye teenon paryaayavachi hai
 For example, if you want to perform the ritual of Darshan Purnamas for the attainment of heaven, then Darshan and Purnamas will be Angi and Prayas will be part of it
 darsh yag amavasya tithi ko or poornmaas yag poornima tithi ko hota he
 ) In this, the organ is the prime organ sponsor and the organ is usable
 is prakaar dharmaprapti ke sadhano ko jaanakar anushthan ke liye paurvapary kaa bhi gyaan apekshit he evam fal ke liye anushthey agni hotradi karmon ke prakaran main purvang or uttarang sadhano kaa bhi vivechan he, jinke liye "prakruti" shabd kaa prayog hota he
 But there is no recitation of the Anga in the Sannidhi of the solar day
 us sthal par aakanksha ke udai hone par darsh poornmaas main pratipaadit angon ko lenaa hota he jise atidesh kehete hai
 
 saamaanya rup se nirnay hone par bhi kis karm se kis karm main ang kaa aagaman hota he, iskaa vivechan visheshatidesh se kaha gaya he
 In spite of the excesses of the limbs, due to the difference in nature, the text is read in place of Prakrit
 udaahranarth "agney twa jushta nirvpaami"
 In this Shrutivakya, by placing the Suryapada of "suryohyeshti" in place of fire post, "surya Tvajushtam Nirvapami" recites this shruti
 aise vaakya ko "ooh" kehete hai
 Without the knowledge of these things, it is not possible to understand which parts should be used where and how, so that the ritual can be properly fruitful
 jis sthal par ang pathit na ho vahaan anya sthal se ang laana chahie, kintu jo vikruti yag ke upkaar kar sakate hon ve hi prakruti main liye ja sakate hai
 Those who cannot do favors in deformity, there is no recitation of other organs
 or unka anushthan bhi nahin hota
 Such words are called "obstructions"
 kis ang kaa baadh hota he or kiskaa nahin, iskaa nirnay "ooh" baadh ke adheen he
 And the desired fruitful karma is only one
 kintu kahin kahin anek bhi hote hai
 Some organs are ritualized before the head and some are also performed after the head
 udaahranarth samidheni prayajadi tathaa swisht krit anuyajadi
 It has been said about using those organs at the same time or multiple times - ek baar prayog karne kaa naam tantra he or anek baar ke karne kaa naam "aavriti" athwa "awaap" he
 Somewhere the organs are ritualized by mechanism and elsewhere by frequency
 isliye tantra or awaap kaa vichaar bhi aavashyak he
 For a particular fruit, do the ritual of the head organ and also perform its organs
 un angon ko bhi anya angon kii apeksha hone par jiske prayog kii aavashyaktaa hoti he use prasangi kehete hai
 It consists of the head mechanism, which is called context
 udaahranarth agnishtomic pashu purodashadi purvokt vishyon kaa purnagyata vyakti hi sangopang dharmanushthan kar saktaa he, jisaki vivechna "mimasaa darshan" main jaimini ne kii he
 The philosophy of this philosophy depicts the Dharmapramanas and depicts method, economism mantra, memory, etiquette, nomadism, conclusive sentences and strength
 dwitiyadhyaay main shabdaantar, abhyaas, sankhya, sangya, gun or prakarnaantar, ye chah karm bhed ke pramaan hai
 Shruti, gender, sentence, episode, place and Samakhya are the six evaluative evidences in Tritiyadhyaya
 chaturthadhyay main, shruti arth, paath, sthaan, mukhya or pravriti main chah bodhak pramaan hai There are seven types of excesses in Panchmadhyaya, directive, directive, nominal order, hypothetical order, dependency order and place-of-order
 ant ke do bhed saptavadhyay main varnit nahin hai
 These are denoted in the sense of authority and placements mandate
 navam adhyay main mantroh, samoh or sanskaroh ke bhed se teen prakaar ke "ooh" kaa nirupan he
 In Dasamadhyaya, there are three types of obstruction representations of distinction between earthlope, pratyamnaya and prohibition
 ekadshadhyay main tantra or aavaay kaa nirupan he
 Dwadasadhyaya has a representation of "context"
 is prakaar ek ek vishay kaa pratipaadan dwadashadhyaayaatmak mimasaa darshan main kiya gaya he jise "dwadashalakshani" bhi kaha gaya he
 Here the word symptom is a textbook isko do prakaar se vibhakt kiya gaya he jise upadesh or atidesh kehete hai
 Preaching is discussed in the first chapters
 dwitiya ke chah adhyyon main atidesh kaa vivechan he
 The above preaching is the overarching doctrine
 shaastra deepikacar parthasarathi mishra ke anusaar upadesh vichaar ke ananthar atidesh vichaar kaa aarambh hota he
 There are two chapters in present-day epistemology philosophy
 prayek adhyay main chaar paad hote hai, kintu tritiy, shashth or dasham adhyyon main aath aath paad hai, jise "shabra" adhyay bhi kehete hai
 In this way there are sixty feet in the whole book
 is darshan kii sutarasankhya main vivaad he
 In someone's opinion, two thousand six hundred fifty two, in another opinion two thousand seven hundred forty two sutras
 uparyukt varnan "aesekit" kii "karmmimasaa" naamak pustak prishth chaar main pratipaadit he
 "nyayamala", published from Anand Ashram Poona, has two thousand and forty five sutras
 isi prakaar kuch vyaktiyon ke mat se adhikaran sankhya nau sau saat praapt hoti he
 Some have nine hundred and fifteen sutras
 kintu "mimasasar sangrah" ke karta shankar bhatta ke anusaar "purvashatk" main paanch sau tees, uttardatk main chaar sau sattar sutara hai
 Thus the entire tribunal is divided into a thousand numbers
 uparyukt shloke ke anusaar adhikranon kii sankhya ek sahasr do sau pachaas he
 a tribunal is formed from many sutras, which consists of a principal sutra and other virtue sutras
 pradhan sutara purv paksh kaa pratipaadan karata he or anya sutara siddhant kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 Somewhere the northeast side has been rendered by two sources
 aise hi kahin kahin par bina sutara ke hi purv paksh kaa utthapan karke sutara se siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Somewhere, in principle, the ex-party tax doctrine has been rendered by the undertaking
 ek paad main katipay adhikaran hote hai
 For example, there are eight tribunals in the first foot
 adhikaran main chha: padaarth hote hai - vishay, sanshay, purvapaksh, siddhant prayojan or sangati
 Consistency is of three types - scriptural consistency, chapter consistency, and foot consistency
 pratham sutara - pratham adhikaran kaa naam jigyaasa adhikaran he
 Thought is the subject of science
 vichaar shaastra aarambh karne yogya he yaa nahin, yah sanshay he
 Not initiable, this is the former side
 siddhant he ki vichaar shaastra aarambh karnaa chahie
 The origin of this subject is the study method in the opinion of Kumaril Bhatt and the teaching method in the "prabhakar" view
 purvapaksh main adhyayan kaa adrishy prayojan he or siddhant paksh main arth-gyaan-rup drusht prayojan he
 Since the religion of religion is related to philosophy, its interpretation in this school of thought is relevant
 is adhikaran main adhyayan drushtaarth hota he, yahi siddh kiya gaya he
 Therefore, the basic method of thinking is the study method
 arthgyan kaa saadhan adhyayan vidhi se akshipt hota he
 That is why the beginning of the scripture is valid
 dwitiya sutara - dwitiya adhikaran main dharm kaa lakshan or pramaan he, jisaki kartavyata vidhivaakya se prathit hoti he
 He is a means of credit
 yahan shrey shabd se aihik or aamushmik donon arth abhipret hai
 Gumak is a legal proof in the religion
 jo nishedh dwaara pratipaadit hota he vah anarth kaa saadhan hota he, use hi adharm kehete hai
 Third Sutra - The third sentence is the proof of the law sentence
 yahan pratigya maatr kii gai he
 They are said to be of two types - "chodnaiv Symptom Yasya, Chodana Symptom Me Yasya" ie here the direct evidence is not proof from religion, but legalism is considered as proof in religion
 chaturth sutara - is sutara main pratham pratigya ke samarthan ke liye chaturth adhikaran he
 Characterization of the Lok Siddha direct evidence in this tribunal - "indriarthasanikarsjanyajanam gyanam pratham"
 arthath pratyaksh vartmaan sannikrusht ko hi grahan karata he or dharm utpadyman he, atev pratyaksh dharm main pramaan nahin ho saktaa, kyonki dharm bhavishyat kaalik he
 From these words, the philosopher has not even considered the evidential inference heat and economics
 pancham sutara - chaturth sutara main chaturth adhikaran kii pratham jigyaasa kaa samarthan karke pancham sutara ke pancham adhikaran main dwitiya pratigya kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 Law is the only proof in this tribunal, this pledge has been supported
 isi prasang main pramaanon kaa pramanya swat: utpann or swat: gruhit hota he
 That is, the knowledgeable material generates authenticity, and from the same material also becomes authentic
 vaakya do prakaar ke hote hai - loukik or vaidic
 Because of the proverbial sentence being masculine, malevolent delusions are accompanied by faults, pramad, vipralambha, karanapatava etc
, therefore, the sentence is not proof
 mantra brahmanatmak shabdarashi veda apaurushey he
 Therefore, due to not being illusory due to imperfection in legalism, legalism is the only proof in religion
 is dwitiya pratigya kaa samarthan karne ke liye pramaan kaa lakshan or shabdaarth kaa sambandh nity he
 Badarayana has also not accepted transcendence in Pramanya
 padaarth-pratipaadan main sanket dwaara shabd se padaarthon kaa, vaakyarth-pratipaadan main granth kaa or rachana dwaara purush kaa tridha sambandh hota he
 The entry of the man into the Veda has been denied by assuming the words and the meaning of the word-reader-relationship regularly
 arthath, veda purush ke dwaara pranit hai -aisa kehane kaa kaaran yah he ki hamanen vaakyon ko bina vyakti ke kabhi nahin suna, padhaa yaa janaa he
 Whereas, in the opinion of the Mimansakas, the relation of the word and the word Ghatpatadi-meaning is constant
 atah 'ye pad is arth ko bataata he'- is baat kaa hamen pataa na hone par bhi pad apane pratipaadya ko bataata hi he
 That is, even if there is no Shakti Graha, there is only the ability of rendering in the verse
 or vaakyarth sambandh ke dwaara purush sambandh ko pruthak karne ke liye vaakyadhikaran kii pravriti he
 In this tribunal, as the substance of the verse has power, the sentence has power in the sentence, such is not required for those who render, because the substance present in the verse is discovered by aspiration, merit and attachment
 Renders vaiyaakaran mat se vaakyarth vaakyashakti se bhaasith hota he
 According to this opinion, the relation of substances in word sense is related to the connection of dignity
 yah naiyayikon kaa mat he, jisase vaakya kii vaakyarth main pruthak shakti kii pratiti hoti he, kintu kumaril bhatta ne abhihitanvay kaa samarthan kiya he
 Prabhakar has supported Anavitabhidhan
 is tarah vaakyarth main purush sandendh dwitiya prakaar se nirast hua
 The third type is through scripture
 sandarbh vaakya kaa purush ke saath do prakaar se sambandh hota he, ek kartri-karm-bhav-sambandh dwaara or dwitiya prayukt-pravachan-bhav-sambandh dwaara hota he
 The discourse is common and the composition is extraordinary
 asaadhaaran visheshan hota he
 Therefore Veda is Pourusheya
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar vedon main purush, desh, nadi, vriksh aadi ke nirdesh hone ke kaaran vedon ko purushpranit athwa paurushey kehete hai, kintu mimasaa darshan ke anusaar pravachan bhi asaadhaaran mana gaya he
 For example, the legend about "katasamhita" or "kat brahmana" is the legend that "sorrow" was studied completely by Maharishi among many branch chapters
 dwitiya hetu he ki veda main purush, nadi aadi kaa naam aata he, isse bhi veda paurushey siddh hota he, kintu yah kalpana chatur-buddhi-vihit nahin; kyonki praaia: sarvapratham sansaarik vastuon ke naam veda se hi aae hai, usee drushti se lok -naam kii parampara chali he
 That is, the Vedas do not consider history to be impermanent, but it represents the continuity of history, its detailed interpretation is visible in the "shabarbhyas" of the epistle
 nity vishay or vaakya athwa vachan ko yathanupurvi brahmarshigan samadhi main darshan karte hai, atev veda main purvapurush kartrutvkalpana kaa lesh bhi samavesh nahin he
 "cosmic creations are masculine due to their male special curiosity, such as Mahabharata, Ramayana etc
 kumaril bhatta ke anusaar adhyayan parampara anadi he
 Therefore, Vedas are also extraordinary
 aise hi adhikaran siddhant nyaay se hi veda granth rachana ke dwaara purush sambandh nahin ho saktaa, atev vidhi vaakya hi dharm main pramaan he
 There is no fundamental formula in the philosophy of epistemology
 yadhyapi uttarmimasaa ke '"ek evatman: sharire bhavat" is sutara ke bhashya main shankaracharya ne likhaa he ki "purv-tantra" main atmpratipadak sutara nahin he, is vachan ko kahkar aatm swaroop kaa vivechan kiya he
 Quoting the Vrittikārā मतa doctrine authentically, it is written: "atmabhidhanprasaktau yathatmastitvam and sharike vakshyam:"
 abhipraay yah hua ki purvamimasaa bhi uttarmimasaa kii tarah advay aatma ko maanakar hi nirmit hue hai, tathaapi purvamimasaa sharir ke atirikt kartta-bhokta aatmatatv ko maanakar hi prachlit hua he, kyonki karm-siddhant ke antargat "kritahani" or "akrutabhyagam" nihit he
 And from here there is the accomplishment of rebirth etc
 "chodana punararambh:" "satsamprayoge purushasyendryanam" in donon sutron se aatmbeej kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 And Vapan etc
 is the sacrament of pod
 purusharth main purush shabd se asthi yajna or krit yag se aatma ko fal prapti hoti he
 Shabar Swami, without specifying the sutra, considered the "yagyayudh Sentence" as an instrument, refuting the opinion of the non-believer, and proved the form of self through logic and srutis, which also proved the Vedas authenticity
 uttar-mimasaa main aatma ko ek hi mana gaya he; kintu "sankhya yoga", nyaay, vaisheshik or purvamimasaa main aatma ko anek mana gaya he, jiskaa karm ke dwaara sharir, indriya or man se sambandh hota he
 Therefore, body, sense and subject are called bandhas
 ukt tray aatma ko bandhan main daalate hai, jisase aatma sukhdu:khadi dwandv ko bhogata he
 While doing routine katattavya buddhi to routine moral deeds, the creature keeps on consuming the destiny deeds
 sharir indriya se atirikt jo brahm buddhi se aatma kii upasna karata he uskaa sharir indriya aadi se sambandh kaa koi kaaran nahin he, aisa vyakti vartmaan sharir ke naash ke pashchaat swa swaroop main sthit ho jaataa he
 According to Uttarmimamsa, body, senses and subject have been called bonds which are the cause of ignorance; His retirement is salvation
 udaahranarth - "nivritiratma Mohsya Known purvamimasaa bhi yahi sweekaar karata he ki sharir, indriya or vishyon kaa sambandh hi bandhan hai, tathaa uskaa vilay hi moksh he, jiskaa saadhan, gyaan or karm samucchy he
 There are two types of enlightenment
 shariratirikt atmagyaan ritu kaa ang hota he, jo ni:shreyaskaarak he
 Vedic and temporal sentences have been interpreted by a number of thousands of sentences for judicial usable judgments
 atev bhartiya darshanon main pratham sthaan karm pratipadak purvamimasaa darshan kaa hi he
 Uttarmimamsa considers creation from ignorance and destruction of creation from enlightenment
 nyaay, vaisheshik darshan ne dvanukadi kram se mahabhoot paryant mahasrishti or mahabhoot se parmaanu paryant vinaash ko mahapralay kaha he
 That is, the entire gesture functions are generated in a double order and are destroyed from macro to nuclear
 panch mahabhuton main prithvi, jal, tej or vaayu ke parmaanu nity hai
 The sky itself is continual, but according to the earlier epistemology, there are two types of creation and three types of holocaust, in which the word Mahasrishti and Khand Srishti are called two creation
 aise hi pralay, mahapralay or khand pralay shabd se teen pralay kahe gaye hai
 Among them, Khandi Srishti and Khanda Pralaya have been considered similar to nowadays
 udaahranarth kisi sthal vishesh kaa bukamp aadi se vinaash ho jaataa he or kahin par naveen vastu kii sristi ho jaati he
 In Mahasrishti, the creation of atoms in the Panchamabhuta by the atom from the atoms in the Mahasrishti, which is mentioned in the tenth mandala of the Rigveda - matsaypuranadi main bhi khand pralay ke antargat vidyaman padaarthon kii sthiti kaa vivaran praapt hota he, kintu purv mimasaa mahasrishti or mahapralay ko sweekaar nahin karata
 According to him, no evidence is available in the destruction of all substances
 jaisaa ki vaarthikkaar ne kaha he - Mimamsa philosophy considers block creation and block holocaust
 bhartiya chha: aastik darshanon main nyaay, vaisheshik or vedant kii ishwar sadhak yuktiyaan praaia: samaan hi hai
 For example "yato va Imani Bhoothani Jayante", "dyavabhumi Janayan Dev Ek:" "vishvasya Kattra Bhuvanasya Gopta" through these Srutis and "janmadasya Yatra": This Vedanta Sutra proves God
 isi prakaar nyaay shaastra ke "kshityankuradik kartrujanrya kaaryatvat ghatavat" anumaan se bhi ishwar kii siddhi kii gai he, kintu vedantiyon ne shrutiyon se ishwar ko siddh kar anumaan pramaan ko unka sahakaari kaaran mana he
 And Naiyayikas have supposedly proved God to be the cooperative cause of Shrutis
 sankhya darshan main do mat hai - seshwar or nirishwar
 The Sesvara Samkhists believe in God, but treat him with a special word
 nirishwar sankhyavaadee ishwar kaa nishedh karte hai, "kintu vigyaan bhikshu ne "ishwarasiddhe:" is sutara main "pramanabhavat" is pad kaa ullekh kar ishwar ko sweekaar kiya he
 Mimamsa philosophy does not prohibit the support of God in the same manner as the Naiyayikas, and like the Nirishvara Samyakists, but in the "sambandesh Parihar" treatise, Kumaril Bhatt has resolved the meaning of God in relation to the word
 abhipraay yah he ki sambandh kaa karta ishwar nahin he
 By accepting the above words, it is popular that Mimamsak is an atheist
 kumaril bhatta, nandishwar aadi mimasakon ne anumaansiddh ishwar kaa niraakaran kiya he or vedasiddh ishwar ko sweekaar kiya he
 In fact, Mimamsa accepts Siddha Brahma or God from the Veda
 kyaaki mimasaa darshan veda kaa swatah pramaan maanata he
 Mimamsa is also known as Purvimamsa and Vedantaka Uttermimansa
 isse bhi veydant kaa mimasaa ke sidbhant ar mimasaa kaa veydant ke siddhanth maanya hai yah baat spasht haati he
 Vedhita Yagadi Karma Dravya and Deity are compatible with these two
 dravya dadhyadi he or devtaa shastrake samadhigamya he
 That is, the sentence which the deity says is considered the deity
 yahan devtaa ke vishay main teen paksh dashamadhyay ke chaturthpad main or shabar bhashya aadi granthon main bhi sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The meaning deity is the specific deity and the word deity
 in teenon main antim paksh hi siddhant he, kyonki arth kaa samaran shabd ke dwaara hua karata he
 Therefore, because of the first appearance of the word, the word itself has been considered a deity
 udaahranarth "indraay swaha, takshakaay swaha" shabdon main indraay or takshakaay ye chaturthaant pad hi devtaa hai
 Even those who accept the meaning of the deity cannot ignore the word
 at: teenon pakshon main shabd mukhya hone ke kaaran mimasakon ne shabd ko hi devtaa sweekaar kiya he
 There is a rule here - the deity word which is in the method sentence should be pronounced in evacuation, renunciation and hymn, etc
, not its synonyms
 udaahranarth "aagneyamshtakapalam" main agni ke paryaayavachi "jatvedas" shabd kaa prayog nahin karnaa chahie
 It is known from the above things that the "word goddess" is the principle of Mimamsa philosophy
 devtaa ke vigrahadi sadasad bhav kaa vichaar - agni aadi devtaa ke vigrahadi paanch is darshan main maane jate hai
 That is, Vigraha, Havish, Bhoga, Aishwarya, happiness and fruitfulness are these five Vigrasha
 ukt vachan ke aadhaar par hi vedantiyon ne devtaa ke vigrahadi paanch swaroop maane hai
 The idea is that just like humans etc
, the taxes, steps etc
 are also of the gods, they accept Havish, eat and eat and give happiness to the Yajaman
 at: devtaa vigrahadiman hai
 The above thought is the same Yasak Maharishi has proved masculinity with the sentence "athakaar Chintanam" of "nirukta"
 mimasaa darshan ke anusaar "shabdamayi devtaa" kaa samarthan kiya gaya he, kintu shabar swami ne apane shashth devataadhikaran bhashya main devtaa vigrah kaa khandan kiya he
 Generally, all the scholars like Parthasarathi, Khandadeva etc
 have followed this path, but in his commentary, Kumaril Bhatt has considered the deity as a part of it and not the deity as the head, and has accepted karma primarily and said that karma is the fruit
 gives
 swami ke rahete hue das se koi fal kii yachana nahin karata
 Karmana Phaljakantavam and Shabdmayi Devta, the above two principles have been supported by other minders by considering the deity Vigrahadi
 bhashyakaar shabar kaa devtaa vigrah kaa niraakaran prodhiwaad se jaananaa chahie
 Therefore, Purvimamsa accepts the "word goddess"
 uskaa gyaan, taddhit, chaturthi vibhakti or mantravarna in teenon se hota he
 The only difference between them is that with the frequency of the corresponding power, the deity realizes
 chaturthi vibhakti lakshanya or mantravarna adhishthan kaa bodhan karata he
 Mimamsadarsan has considered the part of the deeds of the deity in the above manner in terms of his ritualism
 vastutah devatashastra ta nirukt he
 Nirukta is Vedang and epistemology is Vedapang
 atah vaidic devataatatvavichaar ke prasang main nirukt ke vivechan kaa swatantra ar mukhya devataatatvavichaar maananaa avashyak haata he
 The realization through sentences is called sentence comprehension or word comprehension
 vaakya bhi aakhyaant hi hota he - Subantachaya: Sentence, Tingantachayavakyam, Suptingantachayo Sentam
 usamen ye teen paksh hai, jinamein karkanvit kriya honi chahie
 According to Amarkosh - "tidd
subant chayo sentence verb va karkhavitaita"
 arthath subant or tingant vaakyon kaa karkanvit kriya paryavsaan hota he
 The three views of Kumaril Bhatt, Prabhakar and Murari are famous in the East India, but in the last, a famous text with the name "tripad Niti Nayan" has also been known
 mimasakon main abhihitanvayavaad ar anvitabhidhanwaad naam se do prasthaan prasiddh hai
 Among them, first is the opinion of Kumaril Bhatt and second Prabhakar
 shaabdh bodh main bhaavana ko mukhya rup se bhatta ne sweekaar kiya he
 Prabhakar has accepted the task as the main one
 abhihitanvay shabd kaa yah arth he ki padon se pratipaadit padaarth gyaan aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti samanvit hokar lakshana ke dwaara shaabdabodh karaate hai In the Nyayamat, there is power in the substance of the posts and the verses signify knowledge
 padon se padaarth kii upasthiti hoti he
 Similarly, it is said in Mimamsa, for example Jyotishtomen Swarga Kamo Yajet "
 yahan "yajet" main do ansh hai -"yaj" dhaatu or "t" pratyay
 The suffix represents the emotional sense of exposition
 us bhaavana kii teen aakankshaayen hoti hai - saadhyaakanksha sadhanakanksha or "itikartavyatakanksha"
 On attaining realization, there is a true discovery of heaven
 sadhanakanksha hone par dhatworth kaa kaarantven anvay hota he
 
 iti kartavyatakanksha hone par itikartavyatatven anvay hota he
 The sentence states that vishisht arth kaa bodh karne ke liye vaakya lok main prayukt hota he
 Padraavana leads to separate knowledge of substances
 yah vaacharth he, kintu jo padaarthagyan hota he vah shrota ko abhipret nahin or jiske liye vaakya prayukt hua usase shrota kaa kaary nahin hota, aise sthal main vaakya taatpary kii anutpatti hoti he
 Consequently, symptoms have been considered for prevention of deficiency 
 sabhi darshanikon ne taatparyanupapatti ko lakshana kaa beej sweekaar kiya he
 Two types of meanings are considered, first meaning and second meaning
 pratham avaantar taatpary padaarth vishay kaa pratipaadan karata he or mahataatpary vaakyarth vishay kaa pratipaadan karata he
 In aphorism, there is a sense of sentence by sentence
 kumaril bhatta ne nimna shlokon se pratipaadan kiya he - By this word, the form of Bhatt Padaka Orientalism is shown
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki "ananvitavasth" padaarth padon se abhihit hote hai
 Their discovery is only targeted
 atev "anvitabhidhanwaad" kumaril bhatta kaa he, kintu bhatta mat kaa anuvadak anvitabhidhanwaad maanakar jo khandan karte hai, yah uchit nahin he, kyonki unke granthon main uparyukt lekh kii charchaa kahin bhi nahin he
 This is what the word Anavitabhidhan means - the verses are called Anvirtha Bodhan
 atev pad shakti se hi padaarth or vaakyarth donon kaa bodh ho jaataa he
 There is no need to assume additional signs etc
 from the position of power
 vayovruddh purush kisi vastu ko laane le jane ke liye shabd kaa prayog karata he
 The child next to him understands the meaning of the word by hearing the word and seeing the other man carrying and carrying it
 yahi pravriti kaa kaaryatagyaan kaaran he
 In folk, action is also considered as action, similarly in Vedas, Yagadi action is considered as primary work
 yagadi kriya kshanik he or swarg kalantar bhavi he
 Therefore, the said Veda is considered as an object called "apurva," apart from the sentence discussion
 yahan par "ek kaary shabd" kii purvokt do shaktiyaan do arthon main sweekaar kerani padati hai
 One has to accept strength and the other is to be characterized

 etdarth ukt shruti ke aadhaar se yag kaa saadhy, swarg kaa saadhan athwa yag kii uttaravastha evam fal kii purvavastha, ye sab ek vastu siddh hoti hai, jise atishay, apurv, yaa yogyata kehete hai

 Chodanalakshanodharm: In the sutra - "naanu Athatabhumapayartha Bruyat Chodana", etc
, the meaning of the subject is explained

 abhipraay yah he ki jis samagri se gyaan utpann hota he, usee saamagree se pramanya bhi utpann hota he; or jis saamagree se gyaan gruhit hota he usee saamagree se pramanya bhi gruhit hota he

 uttpattividhi : jis vaakya se karm swaroop kii katrtavyata prathmat: vidit hoti ho use utpattividhi kehete hai
 For example, "agnihotra Juhoti" means to get favored from a house called Agnihotra

 For example, "yajet Swarga Kama:" The one who is the priest here is the one who is the bearer of heaven
 isi prakaar se apurv vidhi, niyam vidhi or parisankhya vidhi ke bhed se teen prakaar kii vidhiyaan prasiddh hai - There are two types of methods mentioned above, it should be understood in this way that the origin, appropriation experiment and authority law are all around in the invention

 Forest ecology is a branch of biologically oriented classification of ecological studies
 Thus, forests are studied at many organizational levels, from individual organisms to ecosystems
 Although the term forest refers to an area in which more than one organism lives, forest ecology often focuses on population, community, or ecosystem levels
 taarkik rup se, ped vanya anusandhan ke mahatvapurn ghatak hai, lekin adhiktar wanon main badi sankhya main anya jivan roopon or ajaev ghatakon kaa taatpary yah he ki anya tatv, jaise vanya jeev yaa mitti ke poshak tatv, praayah centre bindu hote hai

 In addition, a significant proportion of the biofuels of a forest ecosystem are often underground, where soil composition, water quality and quantity and levels of various soil nutrients can vary greatly
 isliye, anya sthaliy paudhe samudaayon kii tulana main, van praayah hi behad visham vaataavaran vaale hote hai
