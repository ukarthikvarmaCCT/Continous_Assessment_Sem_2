 His poetry written in Persian is very famous in Iran and Afghanistan, where he is called iqbal-e-lahore
 inhone islam ke dharmik or rajnatik darshan par kaafii likhaa he
 Iqbal became the father of Pakistan because he was "the first person to appeal for the creation of a state consisting of Punjab, North West Frontier Province, Sindh and Balochistan", in his presidential address to the 21st session of the Indian Muslim League
 Which was held on 29 December 1930 in Allahabad

 The zygote or crustacea is a major division of arthropod fauna in the fauna, which consists of large crabs, prawns, chingats, pruning, mahachingt, khandavar, wood yucca and water animal, etc
, but to look for its smallest organisms, we have to resort to the microscope
 
 kathini kii bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke aakar prakaar main bahut hi antar hota he jis kaaran isaki sankshipt paribhaasha dena atyant kathin he
 Every symptom of difficulty, especially in its parasites and highly specialized creatures, changes completely in one way or the other
 crusteshia shabd kaa upyog prarambh main un jeevon ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he jinka kavach kathor tathaa namya ho
 In contrast, other creatures are those whose armor is brittle, such as oysters and snails etc
 parantu ab yah gyaat he ki sab sandhipad jeevon kaa bahi:kankal kathor tathaa namya hota he
 For this reason, difficulty is now isolated from other symptoms
 is varg ke jeev praaia: jalanivaasee hote hai or sansar main koi bhi aisa jalashay nahin he jahaan inaki koi na koi jati na pai jaati ho
 Due to this difficult organisms often breathe through the reservoir or skin
 inamen do jodi shringika jaise avyav mukh ke saamne or teen jodi hanu mukh ke peeche hote hai
 The main familiar organisms of the difficult class are the prawns and crabs that humans use in their food form, but far less economic than these are the organisms Aphipadz, Isopidz, etc
, which act as mamers while living in groups in shallow reservoirs
 We do
 in nimna jeevon kaa bhojan duusare jeev tathaa vanaspatiyon kii tyakt vastuen hai or saath hi yah swayan ucch praaniyon, jaise matsay ityadi, kaa bhojan banate hai
 There are also many talapalvic microbes whose groups change the color of the ocean for miles, so that the fishermen get knowledge of proper fisheries
 is prakaar yah matsay kaa bhojan banakar or saath hi machhuon kii sahaayta karke aarthik laabh pahunchaate hai
 The armor of organisms of this class is divided into groups of segments in the same way as other arthropod organisms, but often some of these segments are also unified
 prayek khand kavach anguthi ke samaan hota he, jo apane agle tathaa pichley khand ke saath namya integument se judaa rahata he
 The dorsal band resembling the arc of each segment is called sternum, and both lateral parts of the tergum, which remain as the bandages, are called plura
 prayek khand ke sternam ke saath ek jodi ang jude rahete hai
 The last segment of the body, which has anus, remains limbless and is called a telson
 aadhunik kathini main koi bhi aisa jeev nahin miltaa jisamen prayek khand ek duusare se spashtatya pruthak ho
 For example, the shell of the body of the prawn body is undivided and oblong and is called carapace
 iske khandon kii sankhya kaa anumaan is bhaag ke saath jude avyavon kii sankhya se lagaaya jaataa he
 The number of combined volumes in this section is considered to be at least six, including the nightly sections
 is bhaag ko sir kehete hai
 When more than this section is included in this part, then the components of the subsequent segments are completely separate from the next elements
 sir ke peeche ke khandon ko sharir ke do bhaagon, vaksh tathaa udar main baanta gaya he, jinako unke vibhinn avyav ek duusare se pruthak karte hai
 But in the high tough malaconstraca etc
, the thoracic segments join the head
 tab is sanyukt bhaag ko shirsovaksh ke naam se abhihit karte hai
 In this way, the form of carapace is also found in many different types of difficult organisms
 yah brankiopoda or austracoda main bivalve kavach ke rup main sharir tathaa angon ko purnataya dhake rahata he, siripedia main yah maansal praavaar ke aakaar kaa hota he or ise pusht karne ke liye calsiumyukt patt bhi sthit rahete hai
 These are some of its special forms, but in the carapace of a simple rectangular form, all the sections of the thorax can be included in the head
 kairapes vibhinn kathiniyon main se praaia: sabhi main paaya jaataa he
 Only Anostraca are organisms that do not have carapace
 kathini ke sharir kii samparivartit charam seemaa iske parashrayi tathaa sthagit jeevon main pai jaati he
 Khandavars stay in their old age with their heads and also have a tendency towards radial symmetry due to their postponed life
 parashrayi jeevon main sharirkhand lupt ho gaye hai or sharir kaa aakaar bhi purna rup se parivartit ho gaya he
 An example of this is rhizocephala, in which the symptoms of difficulty, even the symptoms of arthropods, do not appear in old age
 kathini jeev mukhyat: jalanivaasee hai
 For this reason it is estimated that the body of the ancestor of this class was divided into equal segments and each pair had a pair of limbs attached to it
 inkaa prayek avyav prachlan, bhojanprapti, shwasan tathaa gyanagrahan aadi sab kaary saath-saath karata tha
 a similar system of ingredients has been considered in Trilobita, but this subclass has disappeared
 abhi tak adhunik kathini main kisi bhi aise jeev kaa pataa nahin chalaa jiske avyavon main ye chaaron kaary saath hote hon
 Its head parts are suitable for different special functions, but the components of the torso of Branchiopoda are similar and to some extent can be assumed to have all four functions
 anyathaa angon kii visheshta kathini main kai upayon se unnati kar gai he, kyonki yah vidit he ki jo ang kuch kathiniyon main ek kaary karte hai ve hi kisi duusari kathini main uske vipareet koi anya kaary karte hai
 Development within the difficulty is mainly based on the duty control of these organs
 chaahe kathini ke avyav kisi bhi kaary ke liye upyojit hon or unke aakaar main chaahe kitni vibhinnata kyon na ho, inaki banaavat mukhyat: dwishakhi hoti he
 The base circle of each component is dichotomous and is called a simpod or protopodite and two branches endopodite and exopotide arise from its upper segment
 is prakaar ke mul aadhaarit avyav ko steenopodium kehete hai
 Such simple bifacial components are the copulatory posture of the copipod, the abdominal organs of Malacostraca, and similar organs are also found in the progenitor ovum, called noplius
 isi prakaar ke avyav duusare kathini jeevon main vishesh kaaryon ke liye vibhinn rup dhaaran kar lete hai
 There are two types of eyes of difficulty, medium and combined eye
 ati saral madhyam netra nopleius or anek vayask kathiniyon main rahete hai, parantu mailocostraca main ye lupt ho jate hai or inamen sanyukt netra hi kaaryshil netra hote hai
 Combined eyes are often a pair, which are the descendants of some organisms and many are in one
 netravrunt ko sir kaa avyav mana gaya he, parantu yah sandehatmak he
 Because, in growth it emerges much later in other organs
 pratham shringikas, jo mukh ke saamne rahati he, duusare khand ke avyav maani gai hai
 It is unicellular in the genus Noplius and all subcastes, except only Malacostraca
 inkaa mukhya kaary samvedak he, parantu anek dimbhon or vayask kathiniyon main ye plavan ke kaary main bhi aati hai or anek nar shringika se maadaa ko pakadte bhi hai
 The perforations of the cement glands in Siropedia are on these ingredients, with the help of which their adults are suspended
 yadhyapi dwitiya shringika mukh ke aage sthit rahati he, tathaapi vastav main iskaa sthaan mukh ke peeche tha
 In Noplias, its place is on the side of the mouth and it helps in bringing the food towards the mouth
 iske shesh kaary pratham shringika ke samaan hote hai
 In Melacostraca, one of its branches is multicolored, and its function is sensing only, but the other branch is similar in shape to a flat plate and also serves as a flattening of the float
 nopleius tathaa vayaska kopipoda, isopoda ityadi main adhohanu bhi dwishakhi hote hai or bhojanprapti main sahaayta karte hai, parantu bahuterey kathiniyon main adhohanu shaktimaan hanu kaa rup dhaaran kar lete hai or inaki sataha daant or condon se susajjit hoti he
 Parasites resemble drastic shunds for piercing the stomach of toughness
 upbhanjak tathaa upasambh, yaa pratham or dwitiya mexila, sadaa pattiyon ke samaan chapate hote hai or inke vrintopang par hanu kii shakhikaaye sthit rahati hai
 These three are the last Hanu of the mouth
 sir ke pechhevaale angon main brankiopoda, kopipoda ityadi main aapas main koi vishesh bhinnata nahin hoti or ye ang mukhyat: ek samaan hote hai
 Their shape is similar to that of Melakostraka's Upambhaka and Upajambha
 is prakaar ke avyavon ko fillopodia kehete hai
 But the parts of the torso of Melacostraca are divided into two - eight pairs of thoracic components and six pairs of abdominal organs
 ye ek duusare se purnataya bhinn hote hai
 The components of the thorax are mainly used for motion, and for this reason their endopodides, which form a major part in this work, are transformed in the same way, but their exopodides, which are useful in flotation, have disappeared
 
 vaksh ke purv ek athwa do jodi avyav praaia: padahanu aakaar ke hote hai jis kaaran inhen anupaad naam diya gaya he
 The abdominal organs are always useful in biceps and flotation
 antim udarang ke sahyog se punch minapaksh kaa aakaar dhaaran karke jeev ko vishesh prakaar se ulatney main sahaayta detii he
 Most of the following hardy breathe through the ground, but the organisms whose outer skeleton has become more rigid do respiratory work in their bodies where the floor has been eroded, such as the lining of the carapace; Or this work is done by special senses, which are called hydrocele
 jalashvasanika vaksh yaa uske angon par sthit shakhikaaye hai jinka aakaar chapata hota he or jinaki sookshm bheeton ke bheetar rudhir pravaahit hota rahata he
 In Decapoda, the aqueducts are classified into three categories depending on their position - branching branches, branching branches adjacent to the breastbone, and the branchial mandibular interior that are covered with carapace
 thalanivaasee kathini, jaise kekade ityadi, vayushwasan ke liye anukulit hote hai-inke brakiyal mandal ke astr kaa tal fefdon kaa kaary karata he
 In other organisms, such as isopoda, wood, etc
, there are branchial air-filled ducts found in the colon, similar to the trachea of insects and other vertebrates
 kathiniyon main aaharanlee pratiprishth mukh se lekar ant tak purna sharir main sadaiv sidhi rahati he
 But there are some such creatures in this class in which it is also found neutered or coiled
 anya sandhipad jeevon ke samaan yah bhi teen bhaagon main vibhajit rahati he
 The foreskin and posterior intestines, whose holes are the mouth and anus, and whose inner floor is covered with chitin, which is attached to the outer body of chitin
 teesraa bhaag madhyantra he, jo in donon ke madhya main rahata he
 The muscles of the foreskin are strong and hair, thorns and teeth etc
 develop on their inner floor
 melacostraca main yah bhaag amashay banaata he, jisamen jathar, peshni tathaa chaanan upkaran khaadya rason ko kanon se alag karne ke liye vishesh saadhan rahete hai
 But ghee and filter are usually separate in cardiac and neural organs
 madhyantra ke agle sire par ek jodi yaa adhik yakrut unduk rahete hai jinka kaary avasorana tathaa srav hai or jinamein se shakha nikalakar yakrut bhi bana sakati he
 In the Decapoda, the liver gland makes all the necessary enzymes and also exploits substances deprived of its cavity
 isi main bhojan glikojan ke rup main sanchit hota he
 In some Decapoda, the mesentery is very small, due to which the alimentary canal is known only of the anterior and posterior bowel
 parashrayi kathini jeevon main aaharanlee yaa to nammaatr kii hoti he athwa uskaa bilkul abhaav hota he
 Like other arthropod organisms, blood flows to the body cavities and destinations even in difficulties
 hriday bhi anya sandhipadon kii bhanti aaharanlee ke prishthi hridayaavaran ke bheetar sthit rahata he
 In Branchiopoda, Astracada, and some Melacostraca, the heart is often equal to the entire length of the body, and in addition to the end section of the body, it has a pair of capillary blinds in each section, which goes through the cardiovascular system
 anya kathiniyon main hriday kii lambaai praaia: kam hoti he
 The arteries exit the heart and open in the bloodstream, from where the blood enters the heart through every part and part of the body
 rudhir ko oxygenyukt karne ke liye jalashvasanika isi bhaag main sthit rahati he
 There are also many difficulties in which there is no heart, such as Siripedia, Kopipoda, etc
 and in them blood is transported with the help of operation of the body and the abdomen
 kathiniyon kaa rudhir halakaa taral padaarth hota he jisamen leukosite mila rahata he or antomestroca main haemoglobin bhi upasthit rahata he
 The main excretory senses of difficulty are two pair of glandular and venous glands that open at the postures of the organs of the same name
 donon grathiyon kaa purna vikaas kabhi bhi kisi jati kii ek avasthaa main ek saath nahin miltaa, atev jivan ke itihaas main bhinn-bhinn avasthaaon main ek ke pashchaat duusari granthi kaaryshil hoti he
 For example, in the adult stage of prawns and other decapitals, the adenoid gland is functional and the uppermost gland in its ovum
 parantu adhiktar kathiniyon main iske vipareet dasha hoti he
 In this, the composition of these two glands is the same
 prayek granthi main teen mukhya bhaag hote hai : 1
 antasyun, jo dehguha kaa avshesh tathaa ksheen bhitawala bhitari bhaag he, 2
 utsargi nalika tathaa 3
 parivartit bahirgaman pranali, jo antasyun se judi rahati he or jiskaa ek bhaag granthman bhitawali utsargi nalika he
 Both the ventral and excretory system of the excretory tube grow larger and form the concentric bladder
 kendriya tantrikatantr kaa saamaanya rup bhi anya sandhipad jeevon kii bhanti hota he
 The brain coincides with the periparticular connective with the anterograde neuralgia
 pratiprushthiya tantrika rajju gucchhikaaon kii ek dohari shrinkhalaa he jinka apaas main yoga sanyojakon tathaa samamilon se hota he
 Usually, four pairs of embryonic nerves together make up the brain and the eyelet is also included in this
 kathini main tantrika tantra kii avasthaa main sandhipadon kii adarsh dasha se lekar atyant sankredic dasha tak kii purna shrenee milti he
 In primitive Branchiopoda, the series of anterolateral flakes is staircase-like in some of the anilids and in which the two parts of the chain are separated from each other
 anya kathini samoohon main praaia: shrinkhalaa ke donon bhaagon kaa aapas main sanrohan ho jaataa he, saath hi, gucchhikaaye bhi ek duusare ke sameep aakar sayujjit ho jaati hai
 In the last state of this category, which is found in crabs, only a group of bunch appears
 swatantra tathaa karmanya jeevon ke samaan bahudhaa kathini main bhi ling pruthak hote hai, parantu siripidia tathaa anek parashrayi isopoda ke jeev dwillingi bhi hote hai
 They are precancerous in which the enlargement of the male organs precedes the female organs
 siripedia main sookshm sampoorak nar bhi parjiviyon ke samaan is jati ke saadhaaran athwa dwillingi jeevon ke saath praaia: chipke rahete hai, kyonki inke pulling ang purnroop se garbhaadhan nahin kar sakate
 In many Branciopoda and Astracoda, there is also non-reproductive reproduction
 langik dvirupata bhi inamen saamanyat: pai jaati he

 saanchaa:immanuel Kant Kanti Ethics refers to an ethnological ethics theory, which is related to the German philosopher Emmanuel Kant
 jisko german darshanik emanuele kant ne prastut kiya tha
 This theory was developed as a result of the European Enlightenment era, it is based on the view that an auspicious resolution is intrinsically an auspicious act; an action can only be auspicious if it has the last principle - that following moral rules is a Be done like a duty
 kaant ke naitik niyamo kii sanrachana kaa centre bindu nirapavaad kartavyadesh he jo ki sabhi manushyo par saamaan rup se lagu hota he unke hito or ichhaao par dhyaan die bina
 Kant has invariably formulated various forms of duty
 unke sarvbhaumikta ke siddhant ke anusaar, koi bhi krity tabhi anugneya he jab ki bina kisi virodhabhas ke sabhi logo dwaara ise lagu kiya janaa sambhav ho sake
 If a contradiction arises, it would violate Aristotle's law of non-contradiction which determines that proper action cannot lead to contradiction
 kaant kaa maanavtaa kaa sutarabaddhikaran nirapavaad kartavyadesho kaa doosraa khand he jo bataata hai ki apane prayojan ke liye manushyo ko kabhi dusro ko keval saadhan saadhane maatr ke liye vyavhaar nahin karnaa chahie parantu jaisaa vah swayan ke prati chaahate he vaisaa hi dusro ke prati karnaa chahie
 The point of autonomy concludes that rational factors are bound by moral rules as they wish, while the end is the concept of a thorn in the empire - people behave as if the principles of their actions were established by law for a hypothetical empire Have gone kaant ne purna kartavyo or aparn kartavyon me bhed bhi kiya he
 There is an absolute duty such as the duty to never lie, to always bear the truth; There is an imperfect duty such as the duty to donate which can be applied according to a particular time and place
 america darshanashastri louis posman ne udghrut kiya ki pitism ,rajanithik darshanashastri jin-jacques ruso, tarkwaad or anubhavvaad ke madhya kii aadhunik bahes or prakritik vidhi ke prabhaav ne kaant kii naitikta ke vikaas ko prabhavit kiya he
 Other philosophers hold that Kant's morality is influenced by his parents and his teacher Martin Knutzen
 People influenced by Kanti ethics include philosopher Jurgen Habermas, political philosopher John Rawls, and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan
 german darshanik george wilhem fredrick hegel ne kaant kii aalochana is aadhaar par ki he kii kaant kii dwaara apane naitik siddhant me nirnay ko prabhavit karne vaale karko kaa vishisht vivaran nahin diya gaya he tathaa maanav prakruti ko chhod diya gaya he
 German philosopher Arthur Schopenhaver argued that the purpose of morality is to describe what the behavior of people should be and criticize Kant's theory as being prescriptive
 maaikel stoker kaa tark he ki kartavya ko abhinay maatr se darshane se duusari naitik abhiprerana ksheen ho sakati he jaise ki mitrataa, jabaki marsia bairan ne yah tark dekar is siddhant kaa bachaav kiya he ki kartavya anya prerana ko ksheen nahin karte he
 The Catholic Church has described Christian morality as more compatible with virtue ethics and criticized Kant's morality as contradictory to Christian morality
 yah daawa kii sabhi manushya apni garima or sammaan ke kaaran swaitshasi he matlab kii chikitsakeey peshewaron ko kisi bhi vyakti par unke upachaar ke liye khush hona chahie or unka upachaar keval isliye nahin karnaa chaaiye kii vah samaaj ke liye upyogi he
 Kant's approach to sexual morality emerged with the idea that humans should not be used merely for the purpose of sexual activity, and on their departure, they described certain sexual practices as malicious and insulting, for example: extramarital sex
 nariwadi darshanico ne kanti nitishastr kaa upyog veshyavriti or ratichitran jaise prathaon kii ninda karne ke liye kiya he kyoki ve mahilao kaa upyog keval saadhan maatr ke liye karte he
 Kant believed in this because the animal is not rational, so our duty cannot be towards him except for some indirect duties such as not to develop immoral nature by not being cruel to them
 kaant ne apane nitishastra me jhooth ko ek udhaaharan swarup prastut kiya he or bataaya he ki hamaara purna karttavya he ki hamen hameshaa sach bolnaa chahie bhale hi aisa pratit ho ki sach bolne ki apeksha jhooth bolne par behatar parinaam praapt honge is sthiti me bhi hame hamesh satya ko dhaaran kare rahanaa chahie Although all of Kant's works have developed his theory of morality, it is very clearly the basis of the metaphysics of morality, the practical reasons reviewed and the metaphysics of ethics
 gyanoday parampara kaa bhaag hone par kaant ki naitikta kaa siddhant is vichaar par adhrith he ki logo kaa vyavhaar kis tarah kaa hona chaiye, iskaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye uske peeche chupe hue karno kaa upyog kiya janaa chaiye
 For this, he did not take any specific action, but directed what should be the reason behind behavior for how the behavior of the people should be used
 apane sayukt kaaryo se kaant ne kartavyon kii avadharna dwaara naitik kanoon ke aadhaaro kaa nirmaan kiya| kaant ne apane naitik siddhant kii shuruyaat is tark ke saath ki-keval vahi gun jo purna rup se shubh ho ek shubh sankalp ho saktaa he
 No other quality can take its place because other practices can be used to achieve immoral purposes
 ek shubh sankalp kii visheshta hoti ki vah hameshaa naitik mulyon ko banaaye rakhata he bhale hi vah apane naitik uddeshyon ki purti karne me vifal ho jaye
 Kant has in mind that auspicious resolution is a moral principle that can be freely adopted to achieve moral results of other virtues
 kaant ke liye sankalp ki apeksha shubh sankalp ek vyapak avadharana he jo ki kartavyon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 a resolution that represents duties is different from a resolution that overcomes obstacles to uphold moral norms
 isi prakaar ek karttavyanishth sankalp shubh sankalp kaa ek vishisht maamla he jo ki pratikul paristhitiyon me drishy hota he
 Kant argues that only actions done in relation to duties have moral value
 kintu yah nahin kah sakate ki keval kartavyon ke anusaran ke liye kiye gayi krity nirarthak he
 But this special honor is given to those acts which are done outside the duties
 kaant ki kartavyon ki avadharana ye nahin he ki log apane kartavyon ko anichhaapurvak karte he
 Although duties often motivate people to act against their interests, it comes from the will of those who aspire to uphold moral norms
 atah karta apane kartavyon ke prati kaary karata he kyoki tarksangat protsaahan kaa uski ruchi se adhik mahatva hota he
 Kant wanted to move beyond the general moral conception of duties imposed from outside, which presented an ethic of autonomy and which was independently recognized and created by rational agents
 nirapavaad kartavyadesh ko lagu karne par kartavya utpann hote he kyoki unako paalan karne me vifal hone kaa parinaam yaa to vichaaro me virodhabhas yaa sankalpo me virodhabhas utpann hona he
 Duties are divided into two categories, in which the first is full duty and second is incomplete duty
 ek purna kartavya he ki hamesh satya ko dhaaran kare rakhana atah kabhi jhooth nahin bolnaa chahie kyoki satya bolnaa hamaara purna kartavya he
 An imperfect duty allows flexibility
 Doing favors is an imperfect duty because we are not obliged to do favors all the time
 lekin samay or sthaan ke anusaar ise lagu kar sakate he
 Kant believed that absolute duty is more important than imperfect duties
 yadi in kartavyon ke madhya virodhabhas utpann hota he to purna kartavyon kaa paalan karnaa chahiye
 The first formulation of Kant's morality is invariably dutyless, from which he has obtained four more sutras
 kaant ne nirapavaad karttavyadesh or abhyugat aadesh ke bich bhed bataaya he ek abhyugat aadesh vah he jise hame apni ichhaao kii purti ke liye paalan karnaa chaiye
 Going to the doctor is an affirmation order because we are bound to follow it only when we want health benefits
 Involuntary duty obliges us to act against our wishes; It is the duty of everyone to never lie, no matter what the situation and even if we are not interested in doing so
 yah nirapavaad kartavyadesh naitik rup se badhyakaari he kyoki ve karta ke bare me kisi aakasmik tathyon par aadhaarit naa hokar kisi kaaran par aadhaarit hote he| yah abhyugat aadesh ke vipareet hote he jo ki hame tabhi tak baadhya karte he jab tak ki ham aise samaaj kaa hissaa hote he jiske prati hamaare kartavya he
 We can not abandon the foreign countries without any reason, because we cannot abandon intelligent causes; As a rational doer, we get the duty to be rational therefore rational moral principles are applicable to all rational doers all the time
 kaant ke nirapavaad karttavyadesho kaa pehla sutrikaran saarvbhaumikta he
 For Kant, when one works according to this rule or principle, then the work is appropriate only if it is compatible with this principle which allows that the same work will be universal which can be practiced by all
 
 yah siddhant is pariksha me vifal ho jaayegaa yadi vah saarvbhaumik rup se yaa to avadharana me virodhabhas yaa sankalpo me virodhabhas utpann karata he
 Contradictions arise in conceptions when a theory had to be universal to stop the understanding "because the theory will necessarily destroy itself as soon as it becomes universal law"
 jaise kii udhaaharan ke liye vachan kaa paalan naa karnaa yah siddhant anugneya ho jaye or saarvbhaumik ho jaye to koi bhi kisi ke vachan par vishwaas nahin karegaa or vachan kaa vichaar puri tarah se vyarth ho jaayegaa or yah siddhant apane aap main virodhabhas utpann kar degaa kyoki isaki saarvbhaumikta vachan kii sarthakata ko roak degi
 This theory will also not be moral because it is logically impossible to apply universally - because we cannot imagine a world where this principle becomes universal
 yah siddhant tab bhi aniatik ho jaataa he jabaki vah sankalpo ke saarvbhaumik hone par uname virodhabhas utpann karata he iskaa matlab taarkik virodhabhas se nahin he
 But while none of the intellectuals want that this principle should be universal and lead the affairs of the states
 julia driver ne udhaaharan dekar tark diya he kii siddhant " mai daan nahin karunga" sankalpo me virodhabhas utpann karegaa jabaki vah saarvbhaumik ho jaye, kyoki aisi duniya jahaan koi bhi daan naa detaa ho vah us vyakti ke liye apriy hogi jo ki is siddhant ke anusaar kaary karata ho
 Kant believed that the cause of morality is objective just as physical law is necessary for material actions, whereas rational rules have to be objective rational work
 He further believed that a perfectly rational person should also be completely moral because the whole In a way a rational person finds what is logically necessary to do
 kyoki maanav puri tarah se taarkik nahin he, kaant kaa maananaa tha ki manushyo kii apni atmparak icchaaye tarksangat niyamo ke anuroop honi chahie jise inhone anuroopatmak daayitv kii sangya di
 Kant argued that the objective of the method of reason is primary which is outwardly existing in rational beings as physical laws exist before physical beings, therefore, according to Kant, logical morality is universal and cannot be changed according to circumstances
 
 kaant ke nirapavaad kartavyadesh kaa doosraa sutrikaran he ki maanvo se is tarah bartaav karnaa jaise kii ham swayan ke prati chaahate he
 Kant argued that logical beings can never be treated merely for the purpose of their own means, they should be treated the same as we want towards ourselves in the end because it is necessary that their own rational motifs Should be equally respected
 kaant ne daawa kiya he ki kaaran naitikta ko prerit karte he tathaa yah maang karte he ki ham manushyo sahit anya sabhi praaniyon kii kaaran ke rup me mulbhaawanaao kaa sammaan kare
 a rational animal cannot agree with this, it should be used only for means, so they should always be treated as practicable
 Kant argued that moral obligation is a rational necessity which is a rational resolution
 It is morally right because all rational factors will be logically practicable but would prefer not to be mere means, so it is morally mandatory that we Behave like this
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki ham maanvo ko kabhi ek saadhan ke rup may upyog nahin kar sakate parantu jab ham aisa karte he to ham se vyavhaar parinaatmak rup se hamaare prati bhi karte he
 Kant's law of autonomy expresses the idea that a doer is bound to follow invariant acts because of his rational desire rather than external influence
 kaant kaa maananaa tha ki kisi bhi anya hit ko puraa karne ki ichha se prerit koi naitik kanoon nirapavaad kartavyadesho se inkaar kar degaa tathaa yah tark degaa ki naitik kanoon keval tarksangat sankalp se utpann hona chahie
 The doctrine that people need to recognize the rights of others in order to act autonomously means that moral law should be universal if it is the need of one person, so should all individuals
 is sutrikaran ke liye aavashyak he ki kaary ko aisa samajha janaa chahie jaise ki uskaa siddhant kisi kaalpanik samrajya ke liye kanoon pradaan karnaa he jinhe ki tarksangat karko kaa ek samudaay kanoon ke rup me sweekaar karegaa| is samudaay me prayek vyakti yah siddhant sweekaar karegaa ki kisi vyakti ko keval saadhan maatr ke liye upyog kiye bina bhi unhen sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he
 Although the Kingdom of the End is an ideal — the actions of other people and natural events ensure that good intentions sometimes result in harmful consequences, so we need to act as administrators of this ideal empire is
 amanda or khethani 2018 ne kaant ki naitikta par chaar majboot prabhaavon kaa suzav diya he
 The first Lutherism cult is Pietism, subscribed to by Kant's parents
 pitism ne eemaandaaree or naitik jivan ko adhikarit mat ki apeksha adhik mahatv diya, tathaa bhaawanaao ki tarksangatta se adhik chintaa kii
 Kant believed that rationality is necessary but it should be related to morality and good will
 doosraa rajnatik darshanik jin-jacques ruso he jinaki rachana saamaajik anubandh ne maanvo ke moulik mulyon par kaant ke drushtikon ko prabhvit kiya
 Pozman referred to contemporary moral debate influencing Kant's ethics
 kaant ke anubhavvaad kii apeksha tarksangatta kaa paksh liya he jiskaa matlab unhone naitikta ko maanviya ichhaao par aadhaarit honi ke bajaaye gyaan ke rup me dekha
 According to Pozmann - natural method and intuition were also influential to Kant
 kaant ki jeevani lekhak manfred kuhn ne suzav diya ki kaant ke mata pita kii kadi mehnat, eemaandaaree, nirmalata or swaavlamban ne unke liye ek udhaaharan sthapit kiya tathaa pitism kii apeksha unhen adhik prabhavit kiya
 In the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Rohlf suggested that Kant was influenced by his teacher Martin Knutzen, who introduced Kant to the work of the English physicists Isaac Newton, who was himself influenced by Christian Wolf and John Locke
 german darshanik jurgan hubrmas ne vyaakhyaan naitikta ke siddhant ko prastaavit kiya he tathaa yah dawa karte he ki yah kanti nitishastr ki santati he
 He proposed that the action should be based on the communication between the people involved in it, in which the interests and intentions should be discussed by rejecting any form of coercion or fraud so that it can be understood by all
 hubrmas vishwaas karte he ki pakshakaro ke madhya anubandh ek naitik nirnay tak pahunchane ke liye atyant mahatvapurn he,kanti naitikta ki bhaanti vyaakhyaan naitikta ek gyanatmak naitik siddhant he jisame mana jaataa he ki satya or asatyata ko naitik prastaavon ke liye uttaradaayi tehraaya ja saktaa he
 It proposes a rule and that moral actions should be universal so that moral actions can be determined and proposed which are similar to Kant's morality
 hubrmas kaa tark he ki unka naitik siddhant kaant kii naitikta kaa sudhara hua rup he
 He has rejected the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics
 kaant ne pratiyaman sansar, jise manushyo dwaara mahasoos or anubhav kiya ja saktaa he or aadhyatmik duniya jahaan kii manushyo kaa pahunchnaa sambhav nahin he, main bhed kiya he
 This bifurcation was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of the human subject, though man is bound to the present world, his work is free in the real world
 hubrmas ke anusaar naitikta samvaad se utpann hoti he jo unki swatantraaa kii bajaay tarksangat or zarurato ke anusaar aavashyak hoti he
 The political philosopher John Rawls's theory of social contract and his development of his theory of justice was influenced by Kant's ethics
 rolls ne tark diya ki ek nyaay sangat samaaj ko apni nyaay sangati praapt karne ke liye nishkapat hona hoga
 He gave importance to imagined needs before the existence of the society, which the society has organized, this is the basic situation
 It should replace the veil of ignorance, where no one knows their position in society, people were inclined towards their own interests and will be prevented from achieving better results
 rolls ke nyaayik siddhant kaa shesh bhaag vishwaas karata he ki vyakti swatantra, saamaan, or naitik he unhone mana sabhi manushya kuch seemaa me tarksangati or budhimatta rakhte he jise inhone naitikta ke ghatak ke rup me dekha or inke adhikario ko saamaan nyaay kaa adhikari bataaya
 Rawls rejected Kant's dualism for the most part, arguing that the Kanti ethics was complete even after its re-creation, and described it as one of the aims of the doctrine of justice
 francisi manovishleshak jacks lekan ne manovishleshan kii naitikta or kaant evik sade par kaaryo dwaara manovishleshan ko kanti naitikta ke saath joda or kaant kii tulan marquis di sade se kii
 Lacken argued that Rotten's theory of enjoyment of sexual pleasure is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria because it can be universal
 unhone prastaavit kiya ki kaant ne maanav swatantraaa ko naitik niyamo ke liye mahatvapurn bataaya he jabaki sade ne aage tark kiya ki maanav swatantraaa keval anandatirekh ke siddhant dwaara puri tarah mahasoos ki ja sakati he
 Onera o'neill is a modern Kantian ethicist at Harvard University studying under John Rawls, who supports the Kantian approach to social justice issues
 o'nil kaa tark he ki saamaajik nyaay kii ek safal kanti vyakhya ko kisi bhi niraadhaar adarshikaran yaa manyata par bharosa nahin karnaa chahie
 He noted that philosophers have previously accused Kant of presenting humans as ideal beings, autonomous beings, and life goals
 halaaki vah kahati he ki kaant kii naitikta ko is adarshikaran ke bina bhi padhaa ja saktaa he
 o'neill has given preference to the concept of Kant to be practical and used by humans instead of principles associated with every human being
 kaant kii pariklpana nirnay lene kaa saadhan he jiskaa matlab ki hamaare dwaara apanaaye gayi siddhanto ko rokane me keval ek vichaar sakasham he ki kya yah siddhant sabhi manushyo dwaara apanaaya ja saktaa he
 If we do not wish that this specific principle should be adopted by everyone, then we cannot give them reason to adopt it
 karno kaa upyog karne or anya logo se tark karne hamen us siddhant ko asweekaar karnaa hoga jise ki saarvbhaumik rup se apanaaya nahi ja saktaa he
 Thus, without adopting the idealistic view of human autonomy, it reached the formulation of universalism without thorn
 saarvbhaumikta ke is tantra ki aavashyaktaa yah nahi he ki ham sabhi saarvbhaumik siddhant ko apanaaye parantu keval swany ko un siddhanto ko apnaane se rokna he jo ham nahi chaahate ki duusare unhen apanaaye
 From this ideal of Kanti morality, o'neill begins to develop the principle of justice
 vah tark detii he ki dhokhe or jabardastee jaise kuch siddhanto ko asweekaar karne se bunayadi dharnao ke liye ek praarambhik bindu miltaa he jisase vah tark detii he ki manushyo ke liye or adhik drudh sankalpit hona, samanta yaa swatantraaa ke siddhant kii atyadhik maang ho sakati aise kai kaary or santhaan he jo kii gaiyr-sarvbhaumik siddhanton par vishwaas karte he jaise kii atyaachaar
 Philosopher Michael Stocker in his research paper Modern Moral Principles has challenged Kanti Morality by arguing that there is a lack of clear morality in the work done by duties
 unhone smith kaa udhaaharan diya he jo kii aspataal me apane mitra se kartavya hone ke kaaran milane jaataa he naa ki dosti ke kaaran unhone tark kiya ki is yatra me kuch naitik kami lag rahi he kyoki yah galat sandesh se prerit he
 Marcia Baron has tried to support Kanti morality on this fact
 kai karno ko prastut karne ke baad ham pate he ki kartavyo se baahar kaam karnaa aapattijanak he unhone tark kiya ki samasyaye keval tab utpann hoti he jab log galat samajhate he ki unka kartavya kya he
 Working out of duties is not intrinsically wrong, but unethical consequences arise when people misunderstand what they are obliged to do
 kartavyo ko bhavaheen or avyaktigat rup me nahi dekha janaa chahie kisi kaa karttavya apane charitra ko viksit karnaa yaa apane vyaktigat sambandho me sudhaar karne kaa ho saktaa he
 The baron has further argued that duties should be viewed as a secondary objective, that is, an objective that controls a situation and determines what should be done
 unhone tark diya ki yah is prakaar dekha gaya ki kartavya naa to kisi ke kaary me naiysargik jhukaav me abhaav ko pradarshit karte he naa hi un uddeshyon or bhaawanaao ko ksheen karte he jo dosti ke liye aavashyak he
 For a baron, being ruled by duties does not mean that thoughts of duty are always the guide of action
 ek jimmedaar naitik kartta ko naitik prashno me ruchi leni chahie jaise ki charitra kaa prashn
 They should guide the moral authority to act with duty
 german darshanik ji
dablue
eff hegal ne kanti naitikta ki do pramukh aalochanaye prastut ki he
 He first argued that Kanti ethics does not provide any specific information about what people should do because Kant's moral law is a completely non-contradictory principle
 unhone tark diya ki kaant ki naitikta me tatwon kii kami he isliye yah naitikta kaa sarvocch siddhant nahi ban saktaa
 To clarify this point, Hagel and his followers presented a series of questions to which either the principle of universal law or the correct answer does not give either a clearly incorrect answer
 hegal ne kaant kaa duusare vyaktiyon ke dhan par bharosa karne karne kaa udhaaharan kaa upyog karte har tark diya he ki kaant kaa saarvbhaumikta kaa siddhant yah nirdharit nahi kar saktaa he ki kya sampati kaa ek saamaajik tantra naitik rup se uchit vichaar he yaa nahi kyoki prayek jabaab virodhabhaso ko lagu kar saktaa he
 He also used the example of helping the poor - if no one would be left poor to help the poor, therefore the subsistence would become impossible if it was universal, which according to Kant's model makes it immoral
 hegal kii duusari aalochana yah thi ki kaant kii naitikta manushyo ko kaaran or kaamana ke bich aantarik sangharsh ke liye majaboor karti he
 According to Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desires and to subordinate them to reasons
 iskaa matlab yah he ki swa-hit or naitikta ke madhya tanaav ko sambodhit kiye bina kaant kii naitikta manushya ko naitik hone ke liye koi kaaran nahi di sakati
 The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhaver criticized Kant's criticism of Dharan, saying that morality should worry that it must necessarily be done
 vah jor dekar kehete he ki naitikta kaa paimaana vastav main kya hota he use samajhane evam vyakhya karne kaa prayaas karnaa chahie jabaki kaant ne ek adarsh duniya main kya kiya janaa chahie iskaa ek adarsh sanskaran prastut kiya he
 Schopenhauer argued that morality should be practical and come to conclusions that could work in the real world and presented as such that it would be able to solve the problems of the world
 shopenhaur ko soundaryashastra ne saamaan rup se aakarshith kiya unhone tark dete hue kaha ki donon maamlo me aadeshaatmak niyam anushaasan kaa sabase mahatvapurn hissaa nahin he kyoki unka maananaa tha ki guno ko sikhaaya nahin ja saktaa
 a person will either be virtuous or not
 vah aprapya saarvbhaumik kanoon ko prastut karne ki bajaay, naitikta kii vishisht avasthaa main dhalaa hua hoga jo logo ke vyavhaar ko maargdarshit tathaa niyantrit karegaa| The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche criticized all contemporary moral systems with a particular focus on Christian and Kanti ethics
 unhone tark diya kii sabhi aadhunik naitik pranalia do samasyagrast visheshtaon ko saanjhaa karti he pehla ve maanavtaa kii prakruti ke bare me aadhyatmik daawa karti he jise kii vyavastha jisame koi maanak shakti he, ke liye anivaary sweekaar kiya janaa chahie
 And second, this system often benefits the interests of some people over others, although Nietzsche's initial objection is not that spiritual claims about humanity are unsupportable
 His two main goals are Kantianism and Christianity which make spiritual moral claims
 Featured prominently in criticism
 nitshe ne kaant kii naitikta ke moulik ghatko ko asweekaar kar diya he vishesh rup se unka tark kii naitik, ishwar or aniatikta ko karno ke madhyam se dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 Nietzsche cast doubt on the use of moral intuition that Kant has used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no standard force in morality
 unhone iske atirikt kaant ke naitik manovigyaan jaise sankalp or vishuddh kaaran kii mahatvapurn avadhranaon ko ksheen karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 Like Kant, Nietzsche has developed the concept of autonomy, but he rejects Kant's idea that we need to respect the autonomy of others in order to evaluate our autonomy
 nitshe kaa naitik manovigyaan prakrutivaadee adhyayan dawra kaant kii ichha or kaaran kii avadharana ke vipareet pataa he
 Reason has a fundamentally different purpose for will under the Kanti framework because it has the ability to stand behind circumstances and make independent decisions 
 nitshe ne swany hamaari saamaajik sanrachana kii vibhinn preranaon evam pravriti ke vichaar ko prakat kiya
 Thus, when it seems that our intellect has decided against our lust, it is actually our alternative lust that takes effect over the other two
 buddhi ke virodh me vritti kii kaant kii avadharana ke yah sidhe vipareet he bajaay yah sirf ek or vritti he
 Thus it is not able to stand behind the circumstances and make decisions
 nirnay ko swany bane sabase shaktishaalee kaamana dawra nirdharit kiya ja saktaa he
 Kanti Critics have argued that Nietzsche's behavioral philosophy requires a self-capable existence to stand behind the Kanti spirit
 a person becomes a self-worth that is the main idea of nietzsche's philosophy
 use swayan ko ekikrut karta ke rup me samajhane me sakasham hona chahie
 Even if the doer is influenced by his wishes, he should consider them as his own, which weakens Nietzsche's concept of autonomy
 upyogetavaadi darshanik jon stuart mil ne kaant kii aalochana naitik niyamo ko naitik antargyaan ke dwaara nyyochit nahin tehraane ko lekar kii he jo kii upyogetavaadi siddhant par aadhaarit he 
 Mill argued that Kant's ethics does not explain why some actions are wrong without worrying about utilitarianism
 naitikta ke aadhaar par mil kaa maananaa tha kii kaant ke karno par vishwaas kii apeksha unka upyogetavaad kaa siddhant antargyaan kaa ek majboot aadhaar he or yah behatar tarah se spasht kar saktaa he kii kuch kaary sahi yaa galat kyon he| Quality ethics is a form of moral theory that emphasizes the character of the subject rather than specific actions
 iske kai samarthako ne naitikta ke liye kaant ke kartavya vaigyanik drushtikon kii aalochana kii he
 Elizaveth Annscomb has criticized modern ethics, including Kantianism, for their passion and obligation to the laws, as well as argued that the laws relying on universal moral principles are too harsh
 ascomb ne sujav diya kyoki naitik kanoon, naitik vidhi banane vaale me antanihit hota he atah yah aadhunik dharmanirpeksh samaaj me aprasangik he
 Alasdair mcintyre has criticized Kant's formulation of universality after his creation, arguing that various trivial and immoral theories can succeed in its examination, such as fulfilling all the promises in his entire life except one 
 unhone iske atirikt kaant ke maanavtaa ke sutrikaran 'maanavtaa apane uddeshy ke rup me' ko chunauti di or kaha kaant ne dusro ko saadhan ke rup main vyavhaar naa karne kaa koi kaaran nahin diya he
 The theory that treating everyone except me as a means may be unethical but universal
 banard williams tark karte he ki manushyo ke charitra ke sarkaaran dwaara kaant ne manushyo or naitikta ko galat dhang se prastut kiya he
 Philippe Foote has identified Kant as one of a group of philosophers responsible for the neglect of virtue by analytical philosophy
 roman catholic padri sarvar pinkers ne kaant kii naitikta kii apeksha isai naitikat ko arastu kii gun naitikta ke adhik kareeb mana
 He presented quality ethics as 'freedom for excellence', which believes that freedom works according to nature to develop one's quality
 prarambh me iske liye nimnlikhit niyamo kii aavashyaktaa hoti he lekin aashay yah he kii karta sadacharita viksit kare or prasannataa purvak kaary kare
 This is in contrast to the liberty of neglect which Pinkers described with William Ockham and compared with Kant
 is vichaar ke anusaar swatantraaa prakruti ke viruddh sthapit kii jaati he mukt kriyaaye ve he jo junun yaa bhaawanaao se grast hokar nirdhaarit nahin kii jaati
 There is no development or progress in the qualities of a doer, only habit is formed
 yah kaant ke naitik drishtikon ke kareeb he kyoki kaant ke swytta kii dharna kii apeksha he kii karta keval apni bhaawanaao se nirdeshit nahin hote he or yah pinkers kii isai naitikta kii sankalpana ke saath vishmata sthapit karata he
 
 elizaveth enscomb sahit kai darshanik jin bethake elshaten sarvas pinkers,iris murdoch or catholic sarasangrah sabhi ne suzav diya he ki swytta par aadhaarit kaant ki naitik sankalpana iske dohare daawey ki maanav naitikta ke sah vidhayak he or naitikta ek praathamikta he ke virodhabhasi he
 They argue that if something is universally primary then it cannot depend on humans who have not existed forever
 duusari or agar manushya vastav me naitikta kaa nirmaan karte he to vah isse nishpaksh bhav dwaara baadhya nahin he kyoki vah hameshaa ise parivartit karne ke liye swatantra hote he
 This objection seems to be based on the misconception of Kant's ideas because Kant argued that morality is dependent on the concept of a rational resolution
 yah kisi bhi praani kii vishisht aakasmik ichha par aadhaarit nahin he naa hi vishesh maanviya ichhaao par isliye iskaa arth yah nahin he ki kaant ne naitikta ko us par nirbhar bataaya he jo sadaa se astitv me nahin he iske atirikt jis bhav me hamaari ichha kanoon ke adheen hoti he vah thik he yadi hamari ichha tarksangat he isliye hamen ichha kanoon ki riti ke anusaar hi kerani chahie arthath ichha naitik naitik nirnyon ke anusaar hi kerani chahie jo swany sahit sabhi tarksangat praaniyon par lagu hoti he
 | This can easily be understood by interpreting the term 'autonomy' as its Greek root Autonomos: auto + nomos
 arthath kaant ke anusaar ek swayatt sankalp keval vah nahin he jo keval swany kii ichhaao kii purti karata he kintu jo kii ek vaid sankalp he arthath jo saarvbhaumikta ke siddhant ke anuroop he evam jisaki pahchaan kaant ne kaaran ke saath kii he
 Ironically, in another trend, the immutable idea that resolution is precisely the kind of power that Alshten relates to God on the basis of his moral jurisdiction, and that he commands it on an inferior voluntary form of the Divine Order doctrine
 Will make both morality and divine will contingent
 kaant kaa siddhant swayatta ke duusare drushtikon ke bajaay pehle kaa ek sanskaran he isliye na to ishwar or naa hi koi maanav praadhikari jisame devavash maanviya sansathan bhi sammalit he apane naitik siddhant me koi vishisht pramanik bhoomika nibhaate he
 Both Kant and Alshten agree with the idea that God has no other choice but to make the rules consistent with his will, in addition to Karan's immutable fact, including moral truth
 manushyo ke paas aisa vikalp hota he parantu bhinn prakaar se naitikta ke saath unka sambandh vaisaa hi hota he jise kii ishwar kaa; ve naitik tathyon ko pahchaan sakate he parantu ichha ke aakasmik krityon ke madhyam se apni sahmati nirdhaarit nahin karte he
 Kant believed that the ability of humans to be participants in reason should be the basis of morality and it is this ability that makes humans morally important, so they believed that all human beings should have equal dignity and respect
 margaret iton kaa tark he ki naitikta ke anusaar ek chikitsakeey peshewar ko swany ke vyavsaay ko kisi anya vyakti par istemaal karne par prasann hona chahie,tab bhi jab vah swany rogi hon
 For example, a researcher who wishes to test patients without their knowledge should be happy for all researchers
 unka tark he kaant kii swytta kii aavashyaktaa kaa arth yah hoga ki ek rogi ko upachaar ke vishay me 'purnatah suchit nirnay' lene me sakasham hona chahie, anbhigya rogiyon par pareekshan karnaa ise aniatik banaata he| chikitsiya anusandhan ko rogiyon ke prati sammaan se prerit hona chahie
 Therefore they should be informed about all the facts even when preventive advice is given to the patient
 jeremi sugarman ne tark kiya he ki kaant ke swytta ke sutrikaran ki aavashyaktaa he ki rogiyon kaa upyog keval samaaj ke laabh ke liye nahin kiya janaa chahie par unhen hameshaa apane lakshyon sahit ek tark sangat praani ke rup me mana janaa chahie
 Aaron Hinckley explains that continual clarification requires respecting the alternatives that are reached with rationality and not those that are reached by foolish or improper means
 He argues that there is some difference in what a perfectly rational subject will choose and what a patient actually chooses as a result of an unjustified individual characteristic
 yadhpi ek kanti chikitsak ko rogi se jhooth bolnaa yaa baadhya nahin karnaa chahie lekin hinckley kaa suzav he ki paitrukavaad ke kuch rup jaise un jaankariyon ko dabaa kar rakhana jo ki gaiyr-tarksangat pratikriyaaon ko prerit kar sakati he sweekaarya ho sakate he
 Susan Feldman argues in her work 'how pregnancy and abortion should be treated by orthodox ethics' that abortion should be defended according to Kanti ethics
 unhone prastaavit kiya ki ek mahila ko ek sammanit swayatt vyakti jiskaa ki aapane sharir par purna niyantran he ke rup me mana janaa chahie jaisaa ki kaant ne suzav diya tha
 She believes that free choice of women will be the foremost in Kant's morality, the decision of abortion is the need of the mother
 dean haris ne dhyaan diya ki yadi garbhpaat ki charchaa me kanti naitikta kaa upyog kiya janaa he to yah tay kiya janaa chahie ki bhrun swayatt vyakti he yaa nahin
 Karl Cohen, the Kanti ethicist, argues that the ability to be rational or participative in common and rational species is a relevant distinction between humans and root objects or irrational creatures
 kohen kaa maananaa he ki yahan tak ki jab manushya umr yaa maansik aakshamata ke kaaran tarksangat nahin hote tab bhi kartta unase vaisaa vayavhaar karne ke liye baadhya hote he jaisaa vah swany ke prati chaahate he,jo ki samatuly he ki tarksangat vyask jaise ki maan ke jo ki garbhpaat ki ichha rakhti he
 Kant considered human beings subject to the best wishes of self-preservation, race-protection, enjoyment
 unhone tark diya ki maanvo kaa kartavya he ki vah aatmahatya, yonhraas sharabipan sahit un masalo se dur rahe jo swany ko haani pahunchaaye yaa apkshipan karaaye
 This prompted Kant to consider sexual intercourse degrading as it turns humans into blissful objects
 unhone keval vivaah ke antargat sambhog ko sweekaarya kiya jise unhone "keval pashu sandh" ke rup me mana
 He believed that masturbation is worse than suicide, which degrades the level of human beings even below the animal
 He argued that the punishment of rape should be exclusion from society
 Feminist philosopher Catherine mckinnon argued that many contemporary practices would be considered immoral by Kant's standards because they dehumanize women
 yon utpeedan vaishyavriti or ratichitran par vah tark detii he kii yah mahilao ko karm vishyak banaati he or yah maanav swytta ke kaant ke maanako ko puraa nahin karti he vanijyik sambhog kii aalochana donon pakshon ko vastu me badalane ke liye kii gai he
 Mutual consent is problematic because in consent people make themselves karmic
 alan sobal ne vikhyath kiya he ki adhik udaaravaadi kanti nitishastriyo kaa maananaa he ki anya praasangik karno ke aadhaar par mahilao ki sahmati ratichitran or vaishyavriti main unki bhaagedari ko sahi sabit kar sakati he
 Because Kant saw rationality on the basis of being a moral patient — a moral idea that he believed that animals had no moral authority
 kaant ke anusaar jaanavar tarksangat nahin he is aadhaar par koi unke prati aniatik vyavhar nahin kar saktaa
 Although he did not believe that we had any duty to animals, Kant believed that being cruel to animals is wrong because our behavior can affect our attitudes towards humans
 agar ham jaanavaro ko nuksaan pahunchane ke aadi ho jate he to is baat ki adhik sambhaavna he ki ham manushyo ko nuksaan pahunchataa hua dekhnaa sweekaarya kar le
 The ethicist Tom Regan rejected Kant's moral evaluation of animals on the basis of three major points, first, he rejected Kant's claim that the animal was not self-conscious
 unke baad unhone kaant ke us daawey ko chunauti di jo bataata he ki jaanavaro main koi aantarik naitik mulya nahin he kyoki ve naitik nirnay nahin le sakate
 Regan argued that if moral values are determined by the ability to make decisions, then we humans who are incapable of moral consideration should equally consider unnecessary moral reasons
 regan ne antat tark diya ki kaant kaa daawa ki jaanavar keval ek saadhan ke rup main vidhman he niraadhaar he yah tathy ki jaanavaro ke paas jivan he jo acchhee tarah yaa buree tarah guzar saktaa he suzav detaa he ki maanvo ke tarah unke paas bhi apane uddeshy hote he
 Kant believed that the absurd duty ordinances provide us with the principle that we should not lie under any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good results, such as lying to a murderer so that he can find his intended victim
 To reflect
 kaant ne tark diya ki ham puri tarah se nahin jaanate he ki kisi kriya ke kya parinaam honge, nateeja apratyaashit rup se hanikaarak bhi ho saktaa he
 Therefore we should act to avoid a known false 'lie' rather than avoid a possible wrong
 yadi hanikaarak parinaam utpann hote he to ham nirdosh he kyoki hamane apane kartavyaanusaar kaary kiya he
 Julia Driver argues that if we choose to formulate our principles differently then hardly any problem arises
 The principle 'I will lie to save the life of the innocent' can be universal
 halaaki yah nayaa siddhant ab bhi hatyare jise hame aisa karne se bachaane kaa kartavya he, ko saadhan maatr ke rup me dekh saktaa he
 Thus we may still need to tell the killer the truth in Kant's example

 The following things have to be kept in mind in the manufacture of visible lenses: paravartan doordarshiyon kaa abhidrishy darpan hota he, lens nahin
 Gregory made a special study of reflections made by mirrors and lenses
 usne yah bataaya ki yadi darpanon or lenson ke dharaatal shankav vakrata yukt hon to unamem vipathan kaa dosha nahin hota
 Many difficulties are encountered in making the lens of the Shankab curvature, so Gregory made the suggestion that the mirror of the Shankab curvature be used in place of the lens for the vision of the telescope
 is abhidrishyak darpan ko paravartak kaha jaataa he
 Earlier it was also called speculum
 newton hi pratham vyakti tha, jisane paravartak doorabeen kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 With the help of this device, he inspected the satellites of Jupiter and the Dhanvakara of Venus
 paravartan doorabeen main paravartak darpan kaa vishesh mahatv hota he

 anya naam hai captin, dysprol, diamadon, fensom, hedex, mekasalen, nofedol, peralen, pediepirin, parfalgan or solpadin
 peracetamol ko anya opioid ke saath bhi sanyojit kiya jaataa he, jaise diahydrocodin, jise ko-dydramol, oxicodon, yaa hidrocodon ke naam se janaa jaataa he, america main iskaa vipanan kramshah parcosette or vicodinake rup main kiya jaataa he
 Another very commonly used analgesic combination is found to contain propoxyphene napsilate with paracetamol, which is sold from a brand called Darvocet
 peracetamol, kodin or kalmative doxillemin saxinet kaa ek sangyojan sindol yaa marsindol ke naam se bechaa jaataa he
 Paracetamol is used to create a multi-component combination for migraine headaches, typically containing butalbital and paracetamol with caffeine without caffeine and sometimes with codeine
 peracetamol ko aam taur par gaiyr-steroid pratishodh dawaaon ke saath vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, lekin ise ek nahin mana jaataa he
 Like all drugs of this class, its main mechanism of action is inhibition of cyclooxygenase, an enzyme responsible for the production of prostaglandins, which are the main mediators of inflammation, pain, and fever
 isliye, sabhi nsaids main prati-shoth, analgesic, antipyretic gun hote hai
 The specific reactions of each NSAID drug depend on their pharmacological properties, distribution and metabolism
 jahaan ek ore aspirin kii tulana main peracetamol main analgesic or antipyretic gun hote hai, yah prati-shoth kriyaaon par kaary karne main asafal hai, kyonki peracetamol shoth ke ghaavon main upasthit parakside ke ucch str ke liye samvedansheel hota he
 However, the mechanism by which paracetamol reduces fever and pain is still widely debated as paracetamol reduces the production of prostaglandins
 aspirin bhi prostaglandins ke utpaadan kaa sandman karti he, lekin peracetamol ke vipareet isaki prati-shoth kriya kam hoti he
 Similarly, aspirin inhibits the production of the pre-quenching chemical thromboxane, while paracetamol does not
 aspirin ko anzimon ke cychlooxijinej varg ko sandamit karne ke liye janaa jaataa he or peracetamol kii aspirin kii kriya ke saath aanshik samanta ke kaaran, is vishay par adhik anusandhan ho rahaa he ki peracetamol bhi COX ko sandamit karti he yaa nahin
 yah ab spasht he ki peracetamol kam se kam do pathon ke madhyam se kriya karti he
 The COX class of enzymes is responsible for the metabolism of arachidonic acid to a temporary molecule, prostaglandin H2, which turns into a myriad of other pre-inflammatory compounds
 clasical shoth virdohi, jaise nsaids, is pad ko roak dete hai
 Only when suitably oxidized COX enzyme is highly active
 peracetamol COX anzime ke oxykrut rup ko kam karata he, is prakaar se ise purv-shoth rasayanon ko banane se roktaa he
 
 Thus prostaglandin in the CNS reduces the set point of the hypothalamus in the heat regulatory center by reducing the amount of E2
 ek anya anzime COX3 kaa sandman peracetamol ke maamle main vishesh rup se prabhavit hota he
 COX3 is not seen outside of the CNS paragraph text
 peracetamol antarjaat kenabinoid pranali kaa bhi niyaman karti he
 Paracetamol forms AM404 via metabolism, the compound has many functions; Most importantly, it inhibits the endogenous cannabinoid / vanilloid anandamide by the neuron
 jisase sharir ke mukhya dard grahi, TRPV1 kaa sakriyan hota he
 In addition, AM404 inhibits the sodium channel, as do anesthesia lidocaine and procaine
 aisa paaya gaya he ki in main se koi bhi kriya dard ko kam karti he or ye peracetamol kii sambhav kriya pranali ho sakati he, haalanki yah darshaya gaya he ki kenabinoid grahi ko sandamit karke or kenabinoid kii kisi bhi kriyavidhi ko roak kar, peracetamol analgesic prabhaav ko kho detii he, iske liye kaha jaataa he ki isaki dard nivarak kriya main antarjaat kenabinoid pranali kii madhyasthata hoti he
 According to one theory, paracetamol works by inhibiting the COX-3 isoform of the COX class of enzymes
 yah anzime, jab kutton main kaary karata he, ani COX anzimon kii tarah kaaphi samanta darshata he, purv-shoth rasayan banataa he or chaynaatmak rup se peracetamol ke dwaara sandamit hota he
 However, some research suggests that in humans and mice, the COX-3 enzyme occurs without inflammatory action
 ek or sambhaavna yah he ki peracetamol cychlooxijinej ko roktaa he,, lekin aisa shoth ke vaataavaran main hota he, jahaan peroccides kaa sandran ucch hota he, peracetamol kii oxikaran avasthaa ucch hoti he jo isaki kriya ko rokatii he
 This means that paracetamol does not have a direct effect on the location of inflammation, but instead acts by reducing heat, etc
 by acting in the CNS where the atmosphere is not oxidative
 sateek kriyapranali jiske dwaara mana jaataa he ki peracetamol kaary karti he, yah COX-3 ko prabhavit karti he yaa nahin, yah vivaadit he
 Metabolism of paracetamol initially occurs in the liver, producing non-toxic products
 teen metabolizam maarg ullekhneey hai: The hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system metabolizes paracetamol and produces a small but important alkylike metabolomic NAPQI
 NAPQI ab anutkramntic rup se glutetheon ke salphhaidrill samooh ke saath sanyugmit ho jaataa he
 The end products obtained from these three routes are inactive, non-toxic and are eventually excreted by the kidneys
 tisare maarg main, haalanki, madhyasth utpaada NAPQI vishaiylla hota he
 NAPQI is primarily responsible for the toxic effect of paracetamol; This is a classic example of poisoning
 NAPQI kaa utpaadan praathmik rup se cytochrome P450 ke do isoenzimon ke karan hota he: CYP2E1 or cyp1a2
haalanki P450 jin atyadhik bahurupi hota he or peracetamol kii vishaaktata main vyaktigat antar tisare isoengim CYP2D6 ke kaaran maane jate hai
 Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 may contribute to significantly different rates of production of NAPQI
 iske alaava, vyaktiyon ko unki CYP2D6 abhivyakti ke staron ke aadhaar par "extensive", "ultrarapid" or "poor" metabolizamakon ke rup main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa ha i
 haalanki anya P450 anzimon kii tulana main CYP2D6 kam seemaa tak peracetamol ke metabolizam se NAPQI banaata he, isaki kriya extensive or ultrarepid metabolizamakon main peracetamol kii vishaaktata main yogadan karti he, jab peracetamol kii bahut adhik khuraaq le lee jaati he
 At normal doses, NAPQI is quickly uncontrolled by conjugation
 adhik khuraaq le lene ke baad or sambhavatya extensive or ultrarepid metabolizamakon main bhi, yah nirvishikaran kaa maarg santrupt ho jaataa he or ant main NAPQI sanchit ho jaataa he
 The WHO recommends that paracetamol be given to children only when the fever is above 38

 anya saamaanya analgesic jaise aspirin ore ibuprophen ke vipareet, peracetamol kii prati-shoth kriya kaaphi kam hoti he, isliye ise gaiyr-steroid prati-shoth dawa nahin mana gaya he
 Regarding the comparative efficacy, studies show conflicting results when compared with nsaids
 vayaskon main osteoarthritis ke puraane dard ke ek yadrichhik niyantrit pareekshan main paaya gaya ki peracetamol ore ibuprophen samaan rup se laabhakaari he
 However, a randomized controlled trial of acute skeletal muscle pain in children found that the standard dose of ibuprofen provides greater comfort than the standard dose of paracetamol
 bataayi gayi maatra main, peracetamol amashay ke astr ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaati he, rakt ke skandan ko bhi utana hi prabhavit karti he, jitna ki nsaids yaa vrikkon ke kaaryon ko prabhavit karti hai
 However, some studies have shown that the use of high doses increases the risk of high gastrointestinal complications such as catarrhal bleeding

 2008 main, bacchon main peracetamol ke dirghakaalik parshv prabhaavon ke sabase bade adhyayan kaa prakaashan da lanset main kiya gaya
 Studies on more than 200,000 children in 31 countries found that paracetamol use for fever in the first year of life was associated with an increase in asthma symptoms at the age of 6–7 years and 6–7 with the first year of life
 Paracetamol use even at the age of age is associated with an increase in rhinocystivitis and eczema
