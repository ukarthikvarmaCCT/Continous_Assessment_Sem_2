 Both are nutritious to each other despite being independent
 nigam karm, gyaan tathaa upasna kaa swaroop batalaata he tathaa aagam inke upaybhoot sadhano kaa varnan karata he
 That is why Vachaspati Mishra has derived the derivation of 'agam' in 'tattvavashardi' as follows: Agachanti Budhimarohanti Abhyudayani: Shreyasopaya Yasmatt, Sa Agam:
 aagam kaa mukhya lakshya 'kriya' ke upar he, tathaapi gyaan kaa bhi vivaran yahan kam nahin he
 According to 'varahitantra' Agama is conferred with these seven symptoms: 'mahanirvana tantra' ke anusaar kaliyug main praani medhya tathaa amedhya ke vichaaron se bahudhaa hin hote hai or inhen ke kalyanarth mahadev ne aagmon kaa upadesh parvati ko swayan diya
 That is why the worship of Agama is considered to be particularly useful and beneficial in Kali Yuga - Kalau Agamasamati:

 Dowry means property which is given to the bride from the bride's family at the time of marriage

 Elasticity of products within the market system is also considered

 But some of Bhau's actions were considered as a kidnapping of his rights and the Peshwa became angry with him and Baba
 tab baba se protsaahit ho bhaau ne peshwa se shashansanchaalan kaa purnadhikaar maanga, vahi pad jo vigat peshwa ke samay se uske pita kaa tha
 On Peshwa's rejection, Bhau threatened to take over the Peshwapada of the Raja of Kolhapur

 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was the ruler of the Tughlaq dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate
 gayasuddin tululaq kii mrityu ke baad uskaa putr 'june khaan', mohammad bin tululaq ke naam se dilli kii gaddi par baitha
 Its original name was 'ulugh Khan'
 rajamundari ke ek abhilekh main mohammad tululaq ko duniya kaa khan kaha gaya he
 Probably Muhammad Tughlaq was the most educated, learned and qualified person among all the sultans of medieval times
 apni sanak bhari yojanaon, krur-krityon evam duusare ke sukh-dukh ke prati upeksha kaa bhav rakhane ke kaaran ise 'swapnsheel', 'pagal' evam 'rakt-pipaasu' kaha gaya he
 Sultans have been declared unrighteous by historians like Barani, Sirhindi, Nizamuddin, Badauni and Farishta
 singhaasana par baithne ke baad tululaq ne amiron evam saradaaron ko vibhinn oopaadhiyaan evam pad pradaan kiya
 He gave the title of 'bahram Khan' to Tatar Khan, the title of 'imad-ul-mulk' to Malik Qabool and 'wazir-e-mumalik', but later he got the title of Gujarat with the title of 'khane Jahan'
 Was created usne malik aruyaaj ko khwaja jahaan kii oopaadhi ke saath ‚Äòshahana-e-imaarat‚Äô kaa pad, moulana gayasuddin ko 'kutulug khaan' kii oopaadhi ke saath 'vakil-e-dar' kii padavi, apane chachere bhai firoj shah tululaq ko 'naayab barbak' kaa pad pradaan kiya tha
 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was one of the most intelligent, intelligent, religious, fair-minded, art-loving and experienced commander among all the Sultans of Delhi
 vah arabi bhashaa evam farsi bhashaa kaa viddhan tathaa khagolashastra, darshan, ganit, chikitsa, vigyaan, tarkshastra aadi main paarangat tha
 Like Alauddin Khilji, at the beginning of his reign, he neither accepted his position from the Caliph nor took the support of the Ulema class, though it had to do so later

 Adopted a policy of appointing officers on the basis of merit by eliminating race and class discrimination
 vastut: yah us shaasha kaa durbhaagya tha ki, uski yojanaayen safaltaapurvak kriyanvit nahin hui
 Due to which it became the subject of criticism from historians
 mohammad tululaq ke singhaasana par baithte samay dilli sultanate kul 23 praanton main banta thi, jinamein mukhya the - dilli, devgiri, lahore, multan, sarmuti, gujarat, avadh, kannauj, lakhanauti, bihar, malwa, jajanagar, dwarasamudr aadi
 Kashmir and Balochistan were also included in the Delhi Sultanate

 But due to its cruel policy, rebellion started in the state

 Bengal also became independent
 rajarohan ke baad mohammad tululaq ne kuch naveen yojanaon kaa nirmaan kar unhen kriyanvit karne kaa praytn kiya
 like - apni pratham yojana ke dwaara mohammad tululaq ne doaab ke upjaau pradesh main kar kii vruddhi kar di, parantu usee varsh doaab main bhayankar akaal pad gaya, jisase paidaavaar prabhavit hui
 The rebellion in the area led to a rebellion by the Tughlaq officials, which failed the Tughlaq's plan
 mohammad tululaq ne krishi ke vikaas ke liye ‚Äòdiwan-e- amir kohi‚Äô naamak ek naveen vibhaag kii sthapana kii
 Due to corruption of government employees, indifference of farmers, lack of good land, etc
, after three years, their plan for agricultural progress was terminated
 mohammad bin tululaq ne kisaanon ko bahut kam byaaj par rin uplabdh karaayaa
 Tughlaq shifted the capital from Delhi to Devgiri under his second plan
 devgiri ko ‚Äúkuvvatul islam‚Äù bhi kaha gaya
 Sultan Qutubuddin Mubarak Khilji named Devagiri as 'qutbabad' and Muhammad bin Tughlaq changed its name to Daulatabad
 sultan kii is yojana ke liye sarvaadhik aalochana kii gai
 There is a great controversy among historians on the reasons for the change of capital by Muhammad Tughlaq, yet it can be concluded that, Devagiri is situated in the center of Delhi Sultanate, safe from the fear of Mongol invaders, such a stretch towards prosperity of South India etc
 There were reasons why the Sultan thought of changing the capital
 mohammad tululaq kii yah yojana bhi purnatah asafal rahi or usne 1335 i
 main daulatabad se logon ko dilli waapas aane kii anumati de di
 The change of capital resulted in the development of Muslim culture in the South, which eventually opened the way for the rise of the Bahmani Empire
 anubhav maury Under the third plan, Muhammad Tughlaq introduced symbolic and symbolic coins
 sikke sambandhi vividh prayogon ke kaaran hi edward tamas ne use ‚Äòdhanavaanon kaa rajkumaar‚Äô kaha he
 Muhammad Tughlaq introduced the coin named 'dokani'
 barani ke anusaar sambhavtah sultan ne rajkosh kii riktata ke kaaran evam apni samrajya vistaar kii niti ko safal banane hetu sankethik mudra kaa prachlan karavaaya
 Under the sign currency, the sultan probably introduced coins of brass and copper metals, which were worth the rupee of silver
 sikaa dhaalane par rajya kaa niyantran nahin rahane se anek jaali taksaal ban gayi
 Lagaan was given out with fake coins, which caused the economy to collapse
 sankethik mudra chalaane kii prerana china tathaa iran se mili
 The rulers there carried out these schemes successfully, while Muhammad Tughlaq's experiment failed
 sultan ko apni is yojana kii asafalataa par bhayanak aarthik kshati kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Under the fourth plan, the Khurasan and Karachil conquests of Muhammad Tughlaq are mentioned
 khurasana ko jeetne ke liye mohammad tululaq ne 3,70,000 sainikon kii vishaal sena ko ek varsh kaa agrim vetan de diya, parantu raajnneetik parivartan ke kaaran donon deshon ke madhya samjhauta ho gaya, jisase sultan kii yah yojana asafal rahi or use aarthik rup se haani uthaani padi
 Under the Karachil campaign, the Sultan sent a large army under the leadership of Khusro Malik to conquer the hill states
 uski puri sena junglee raaston main bhatak gai, ebn batuta ke anusaar antatah keval das adhikari hi bachakar waapas aa sake
 Thus this plan of Muhammad Tughlaq also failed
 sambhavtah 1328-29 i
 ke madhya mongol akramanakari tarmasharin chaghtai ne ek vishaal sena ke saath bharat par akraman kar multan, lahore se lekar dilli tak ke pradeshon ko rond daalaa
 It is believed that Sultan Muhammad Tughluq returned the bribe to the Mongol leader
 It is also believed that the Mongol leader bribed the Sultan to undermine the status of the Delhi Sultan himself and similarly for the Mongol rule
 Granted
 unke bich jo bhi hua, mongol netaa ke prati is samajhote kii niti ke kaaran sultan ko aalochana kaa shikaar bananaa padaa
 It is true that after this, there was never a Mongol invasion of India during the time of Muhammad Tughluq and that because of his ambitious failed plans, Muhammad Tughluq is called the 'king of failures'
