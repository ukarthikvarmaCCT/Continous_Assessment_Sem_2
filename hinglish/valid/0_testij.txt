 Pablo Neruda was born in Paral, a small town in central Chili
 unka mul naam neftali ricardo reis basolta tha
 He was a poet by nature and the world has seen different colors of his written poems
 ek ore unhone unmatta prem kii kavitaayen likhi hai duusari taraf kadiyal yatharth se otprot
 Some poems appear to be the drivers of his political ideology
 unka pehla kavy sangrah 'twanti lav poems and e saang of dispere' bees saal kii umr main hi prakashit ho gaya tha
 The contribution of making Neruda to the top of world literature was not only in his poems but also his multi-faceted personality
 wo sirf ek kavi hi nahin balki rajaneta or kootneetijna bhi the or lagata he wo jab bhi qadam uthaate the romaanch se bhari koi gali koi sadak saamne hoti thi
 After raising his voice against Chilean dictators, he had to leave the country to save his life
 italy main jahaan sharan lee vahaan bhi prashasan ke saath aankh michauli khelni padi
 Neruda's world famous works 'machhu Picchu's Shikhar' and 'canto General' influenced many poets around the world and Ashok Vajpayee admits that he left a deep impression on the thinking of Indian poets in the fifties and sixties
 1970 main chile main sailwador alende ne samyavaadee sarkaar banaai jo vishwa kii pehali loktantric tareeke se chuni gai samyavaadee sarkaar thi
 Allende appointed Neruda the Chilean ambassador to France in 1971
 or isi varsh unhen sahitya kaa nobel puraskaar bhi mila
 In 1973, the Chilean military general Augusto Pinoche overthrew the Allende government
 isi karrwai main raashtrapati alende kii maut ho gai or aane vaale dinon main alende samarthak hazaron aam logon ko sena ne maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Cancer-stricken Neruda kept praying for the end of this massacre in his home in Chile
 lekin alende kii maut ke 12 din baad hi neruda ne dam tod diya
 The army did not spare even their house and everything there was broken into one
 parinamswaroop is ghar se unke kuch dost unka janaaza lekar nikle
 But despite the military curfew, at every turn of the road, thousands of fans of this fighter fighting against terror and exploitation continued to join the convoy
 rundhe hue galon se ek baar phir umad padaa samyavaadee shakti kaa wo geet jo neruda ne kai baar in logon ke saath mil kar gaaya tha- "ekajute logon ko koi taaqat nahin haraa sakati

 After some time, Mata Kripa gave birth to a beautiful bright child

 An invaluable gem was present in Ashwatthama's head since birth
 jo ki use daitya, daanav, shastr, vyaadhi, devtaa, naag aadi se nirbhay rakhti thi
 At the time of the Mahabharata war, Guru Dronacharya felt it appropriate to support the Kauravas because of their loyalty to the state of Hastinapur

 He took an active part in the war of Mahabharata

 He defeated bhim-putra Ghatotkacha and killed Ghatotkacha's son Anjanaparva
 uske atirikt drupadkumar, shatrunjay, balani, jayanik, jayashv tathaa raja shrutahu ko bhi maar daalaa tha
 He killed ten sons of Kuntibhoja
 pita-putr kii jodi ne mahabharat yuddh ke samay pandav sena ko teetar-bitar kar diya
 Seeing the defeat of the Pandavas' army, Shri Krishna asked Yudhishthira to resort to diplomacy
 is yojana ke tahat yah baat phela di gai ki "ashwatthama maaraa gaya"jab guru dronacharya ne dharmraj yudhisthir se ashwatthama kii satyata jaananaa chaahi to unhone jawaab diya-"ashwatthama maaraa gaya parantu hathi", parantu unhone bade dhire swar main "parantu hathi" kaha, or jhut bolne se batch gaye
 Before this incident, there was a wide churning of the Pandavas and their people with Shri Krishna that it would be true that "but the elephant" should be spoken in such a tone
 shrikrishna ne usee samay shankhanaad kiya, jiske shor se guru dronacharya aakhri shabd nahin sun paae
 Hearing the news of the death of your beloved son, you gave up your arms and closed the eyes in the battlefield and sat in mourning
 guru dronacharya ji ko nihatta jaanakar draupadi ke bhai dyushtadyumna ne talwaar se unka sir kaat daalaa
 After the brutal killing of Guru Dronacharya, the Pandavas started winning

 Bhimsen broke the thigh of the evil and arrogant Duryodhana in a wrestling

 Duryodhana knew the art of binding water
 so jis talab ke paas gadayudhd chal rahaa tha usee talab main ghus gaya or pani ko bandhakar chup gaya
 The victory of Pandavas in the war was confirmed as soon as Duryodhana was defeated, all the people of Pandava camp were getting drunk in the joy of victory
 ashwatthama ne dronacharya vadh ke pashchaat apane pita kii nirmam hatya kaa badla lene ke liye pandavon par narayan astr kaa prayog kiya tha
 In front of which the entire Pandava army laid down its arms
 yuddh pashchaat ashwatthama ne draupadi ke paancho putr or dyushtadyumna kaa vadh kar diya
 Ashwatthama used the Brahmashirsha weapon on Abhimanyu's son Parikshit
 ashwatthama amar he or aaj bhi jivit hai
 Ashwatthama suffered from Kod disease due to the curse of Lord Krishna
 aaj bhi vah jivit he
 Concealed, he reached the Pandavas' camp and killed the remaining brave heroes of the Pandavas with the help of Kripacharya and Kritavarma in the fierce Kalratri
 keval yahi nahin, usne pandavon ke paanchon putron ke sir bhi ashwatthama ne kaat daale
 Everybody condemned this misdeed of Ashwatthama and even Duryodhana did not like it
 putron ke hatya se dukhi draupadi vilaap karne lagi
 Hearing his moan, Arjun vowed to cut off the head of the evil karma killer Brahmin
 arjuna kii pratigya sun ashwatthama bhaag niklaa
 Arjuna followed him by making Shri Krishna a charioteer and taking his Gandiva bow
 ashwatthama ko kahin bhi suraksha nahin mili to bhay ke kaaran usne arjuna par brahmastra kaa prayog kar diya
 Ashwatthama knew to operate Brahmastra but did not know to return it
 us ati prachand tejomay agni ko apni ore aata dekh arjuna ne shrikrishna se vinati kii, “he janardan! aap hi is trigunamayi shrrishti ko rachane vaale parameshwar hai
 At the end of the beginning and the last you remain
 aap hi apane bhaktajanon kii raksha ke liye avatar grahan karte hai
 You are the creation of Brahma Swarup, you follow the form of Vishnu and you are the destiny of Rudra Swaroop
 aap hi bataaiye ki yah prachand agni meri ore kahan se aa rahi he or isse meri raksha kaise hogi?” Sri Krishna said, "arjun! Disturbed by your fear, Ashwatthama said this Brahmastra is in grave danger to you with Brahmastra
 vah ashwatthama iskaa prayog to jaanata he kintu iske nivaaran se anbhigya he
 To avoid this, you also have to use your Brahmastra, because it cannot be prevented by any other weapon
 ” Hearing this mantra of Shri Krishna, Maharathi Arjuna also left his Brahmastra after instant fire

 All the subjects started getting burnt by their flames

 Shri Krishna said, "O Arjuna! Dharmatma, sleeping, inattentive, drunk, mad, ignorant, chariot, killing a woman and child is forbidden according to religion
 isane dharm ke viruddh aacharan kiya he, soye huye nirparaadh baalkon kii hatya kii he

 ” shrikrishna ke in shabdon ko sunne ke baad bhi dhiravaan arjuna ko guruputr par dayaa hi ai or unhone ashwatthama ko jivit hi shivi main le jaakar draupadi ke saamne upasthit kiya
 Mamtamayi Draupadi's tender heart melted after seeing the Guruputra tied like an animal
 usne guruputr ko namaskara kiya or use bandhanmukt karne ke liye arjuna se kaha, “he aryaputra! ye guruputr tathaa brahman hai
 a Brahmin is always worshipable and killing him is a sin

 By killing them my dead son cannot come back! So, you free them
 ” Hearing Draupadi's words of justice and righteousness, everyone praised her, but Bhima's anger did not calm down
 is par shrikrishna ne kaha, “he arjuna! shastron ke anusaar patit brahman kaa vadh bhi paap he or aattaayi ko dand na dena bhi paap he
 So you do what is right

 emeter yaa 'emmapi' kisi paripath kii kisi shakha main bahane vaali vidyut dhara ko maapne vaala yantra he
 The devices used to measure very small currents are called "millimeter" or "micrometer"
 ameter kii sabase puraani dizin di'arsonal kaa dharamapi yaa chalit kundalee dharamapi tha
 In 1820, the ampere invented that if a conductor, in which current flows, is placed in a magnetic field, then a force acts on it
 is bal kaa maan chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata, dharaman or chaalak kii lambaai ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 The direction of this force is determined by Fleming's left-hand law
 apane baayein haath kaa angutha, uske paas kii ungali or bich kii ungali madhyamaa kaa is prakaar failaayen ki ve teenon ek duusare ke lamberup rahen
 If the index finger points in the direction of the magnetic field and the median in the direction of the current, then the speed of the conductor will be in the direction of the thumb
 chumbakeey kshetra main rakhi hui kisi kundali main jab vidyutdhara pravaahit hoti he, to kundali par ek balyugma kaary karne lagata he, jisus vah ghoomane lagati he
 The dharmapi that have been made by using this principle, they are called chalakunda dharamapi
 isamen ek ytaakar kundali hoti he, jisamen patale or vidyutrodhit taanbe ke taar ke bahut chakkar hote hai
 This coil is hung with a screw by a very thin leaf of phosphor brange, one end of the coil is attached to this leaf and the leaf is connected to a connective screw of the dielectric
 is pattee main ek vrittakar samtal yaa natodar darpan bhi laga rahata he, jo pattee ke saath saath ghumta he
 The second end of the coil is connected to a spiral spring of metal, which is connected to the second connective screw
 yah kundali ek shaktishaalee sthaayee naal chumbak ke dhruvon ke bich main lataki rahati he
 The poles of the magnet are curved in concave cylindrical shape
 ek narm lohe kaa chota sa belan donon dhruvakhandon ke bich main kundali ke bheetar ek pech dwaara dharamapi kii peeth main ksaa rahata he
 All these items are kept locked in an non-magnetic box

 When electric current flows in the coil, a force act on the two arms of the coil and rotate the coil from its position, causing a spasm in the phosphor brange leaf and the downward spiral spring and a twitch force pair
 But starts working in the opposite direction
 jisase kundali sheeghra hi santulan main aa jaati he
 If the coil has a deflection angle, the current comes from the following formula: arthath dharaman vikshep kone kaa samaanupati hota he
 These current gauges are extremely durable and sufficiently sensitive
 inase 10-10 ampiore tak kii dhara naapi ja sakati he
 There are mainly two types of magnetoscope
 isamen kundali ek dhaatu ke dhaanche par lapet di jaati he, jisase dhara pravaahit hone par kundali vikshepit ho sheeghra sthir ho jaati he
 As the coil rotates, vortex currents arise in it and its metal structure and stop the coil
 kundali dolan nahin karti, isi se is yantra ko mrit-spand kehete hai
 The horoscope reaches its former position as soon as the current is removed
 atev dhara kaa maan kundali kii purvasthiti tathaa dhara pravaahit hone par kii sthiti ke gyaan se badi saralata se gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 In this currentometer, the coil is tied on a dielectric structure and due to this, there is no vortex current in it
 at: kundali ke vikshep main bahut kam pratirodh padataa he
 The coil oscillates on both sides of its deflection when the current is not flowing through the metal structure
 yah ati sookshmagrahi hota he or kshanik aavesh ko bhi badi sugamawapurv isse ham gyaat kar sakate hai
 These are of two types: attractors and repulsors
 vidyutrodhi taron kii ek sthir kundali se yadi vidyutdhara pravaahit ho, to kundali ke bich main or aasapaas main bhi chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he
 If a piece of cast iron is hung near this horoscope, it gets attracted towards the coil
 is lohe ke tukade main agar ek sanketak laga ho, to sanketak bhi vikshepit ho jayega
 If there is such a mechanism that it can be brought to equilibrium by applying force opposite to the attraction force on the piece of iron, then the value of the current will be known by the deflection of the indicator
 bahudhaa ek sarpil kamaani dwaara is aakarshanabal kaa virodh kiya jaataa he
 The force of attraction is proportional to the square of the current-value
 isliye sanketak kaa vikshep bhi dhara maan ke varg ke samaanupati hoga
 For this reason, it can also find the value of alternating current
 vidyutarodhi taron ke kai chakkaaron kii sthir kundali ke bich, do naram lohe ke patale chad kundali ke aksh ke samaantar lage hai
 One rod is fixed, the other is connected to an indicator which is mounted on a nail itself
 sanketak kaa doosraa sira ek dial par ghumta he
 When the current flows in the coil, both rods become the same type of induced magnet
 chumbakeey niyamon ke anusaar unamem pratikarshan hoto he or sanketak se judaa loha gum jaataa he, jisase sanketak main vikshep hota he
 In this also, the deflection angle is proportional to the square of the torrent
 ye yantra atyant saral or saste hote hai
 When measurement does not require much precision and many robust instruments are required, then ammeters and voltmeters based on this principle are used
 bijli gharon main switchboard par narm lohe ke yantron kaa hi prayog adhiktar hota he
 The attraction or repulsion in the induced magnet does not depend on the direction of fluency
 bal dharaman ke varg kaa samaanupati hota he
 Therefore whatever the direction of current flow, the direction of force is same
 inhen kaarnon se ye yantra disht dhara athwa prayavartin dhara donon ko naapane ke prayog main laae jate hai
 Due to the inductance of the coil, they cannot be used in the measurement of high frequency alternating current
 is prakaar ke emeter vidyutdhara ke ooshmiya prabhaav par nirbhar hote hai
 When current flows through a conductor, then that conductor becomes hot
 utpann ooshmaa kaa maan 2 x ke samaanupati hota he
 If the current is in the ampere and the resistance is in ohms, then ooshmaa kaa maan dharaman ke varg ke samaanupati hota he, arthath dhara kii disha par nirbhar nahin hai
 Therefore, such ammeters can be used to measure both directional or alternating current
 is prabhaav kaa prayog maapanvidhi main do prakaar se kiya gaya he : The first type of instrument was first created by Major Cardew in 1883
 hartman-bron ne isamen sadhaar kiya
 The current flows in the wire and spreads as it is heated
 is samay taar ke bich main judi hui kamaani taar ko khinchati he or ghirani prasar ke anusaar gum jaati he
 At the same time, the pulley indicator is deflected and the current value is displayed on the dial
 dhara kii anupasthiti main taar thandha ho kar sikudta he or sanketak phir apni purv dasha main aa jaataa he
 Such integrators have been used a lot due to being simple and cheap

 The current flows through the wire and heats it
 is taar se jude hue tamba kanstantan taapyugma kaa sangam bhi garam hota he
 Due to this, electric carrying force is produced in the ratio of heat to temperature
 yah ek disht dharamapi main dhara pravaahit karata he
 When the dial is calibrated, it displays the value of the first alternating current

 Sometimes yes, sometimes an article by name: - dwinetri, field glass athwa dwinetri doordarshee samaan athwa darpan samamiti vaale doordarshee-yugma he, jo saath-saath lage hote hai tathaa ek disha main dekhne ke liye parishuddhta se lagaae jate hai
 a simple binocular telescope is a pair of two telescopes of the Galileo type
 dwinetri kaa upyog parthiv vastuon ke dekhne main hota he, isliye yah aavashyak ho jaataa he ki is prakaar ke dwinetri main vastu kaa sidhaa pratibimb bane
 Galilee varieties of vision make direct reflections
 isliye saadhaaran dwinetri doordarshee ke nirmaan main isi prakaar ke doordarshee kaa upyog hota he
 Ordinary binocular telescopes are called theatrical binoculars
 telescope ke vipareet doorabeen upyogkarta ko tri-aiami chhavi prastut karaati he: apekshaakrit nazadik kii vastuon ko dekhte samay darshak kii donon ankhon ke liye thode se alag drushtikon se chhaviyaan prastut hoti hai jo ki mil kar gaharaai kaa prabhaav prastut karti hai
 Unlike monocular telescopes, it does not require an eye to be closed or covered to avoid confusion
 donon ankhon ke prayog se drushtisambandhi tivrata kaaphi bad jaati he or aisa kaaphi dur kii vastuon ke liye bhi hota he jahaan gaharaai kaa abhas spasht nahin hota
 The first binocular visionary was created in 1608 by Leperhe
 yah upkaranika do samaantar aksh ke doordarshiyon kaa yugma thi
 The Galileo variety of telescope has two main drawbacks: 1
 iskaa drushtikshetra vistrut nahin hota tathaa 2
 Its magnification capacity is not high
 kepler kism ke doordarshiyon ko khagoli doordarshee kehete hai
 The Kepler telescope is better than the Galileo telescope in terms of detail and magnification of the field of view, but the Kepler telescope could not be used to make binocular telescopes because the image is inverted
 poro ne ek aise triparshv sangyojan kaa nirmaan kiya jo kepler doordarshee main bane hue ulte pratibimb ko kshaitij or urdhvadhar donon dishaao main sidhaa karke dikhaa saktaa he
 The above invention of Poro is very important in the development of binocular epithelium
 poro ke triparshv sangyojan main do samakon triparshvi ko is prakaar joda jaataa he ki unke karn prishth ek duusare ke sampark main rahete hai or unke purna paravartan prishth paraspar samakonik hote hai
 After Porro, Abe specifically considered the question of tripartite compounds
 aadhunik triparshv dwinetri ke vikaas par aibe ke anusandhanon kaa vishesh prabhaav padaa he
 It is a combination of two telescopes of the Kepler variety, in which the inverted image formed by the visionary's vision makes the two right-angled isosceles trilateral
 ye triparshv doordarshee ke abhidrishyak or upanetra ke bich main sthit rahete hai
 The way in which the reflection in the horizontal and vertical directions is perpendicular to the trilateral is shown in Figure 1

 vastu se ai hui prakashakiran abhidrishyak le1 main se guzarane ke baad pratham triparshv par takaraati he
 The turn cores of this tripartite are vertical, making it perpendicular to the horizontal plane
 pratham triparshv se nikalne ke baad prakashakirane duusare triparshv par girti hai, jisaki vartak kor kshaitij sthiti main rahati he
 This makes the reflection in the vertical plane straight
 duusare triparshv se nikalne ke baad prakashakirane upanetra le2 main pravesh karti he
 This direct reflection is magnified by the subnet
 triparshvon ke kaaran doordarshee kii nalika kii lambaai paryaapt kam ho jaati he
 It is a pair of two microscopes in which the reflection is straightened with the help of trilateral
 isaki visheshta yah hoti he ki isse vastuon ke thospan kaa anubhav hota he
 The experience of distance or depth of two adjacent objects depends on the difference between the eye and the objects
 donon netron ke retinaon par bane hue pratibimbon main kuch antar hota he or isi bhinnata ke kaaran gaharaai yaa thospan kaa anubhav hota he
 The range of stereoscopy ranges from 1,250 to 1,600 yards
 saadharantaya trivimdarshi main ek hi vastu ke do photo is prakaar rakhe jate hai ki unase padaarth ke thospan kaa anubhav hone lagata he
 Two photographs of the object are taken from two lenses located at the same distance as the distance between the eyes
 ab in donon photon ko is tarah vyavasthit kiya jaataa he ki dahini aankh keval dahini ore ke lens se lee hui photo ko hi dekh sake or duusari photo ko na dekh sake
 This system is called a stereoscope
 aisa lagata he ki 17veen sadi main telescope ke avishkaar ke saath hi aise do telescope ko saath laga kar unase praapt hone vaali bainocular drushti ke laabhon ko khoja jane laga
 The earliest telescopes used Galilean optics; She used a convex objective lens and a concave eyepiece lens
 gallilian dizin kaa yah phayda he ki praapt chhavi sidhi hoti he parantu drishy kshetra sankara hota he tathaa iskaa aavardhan bahut adhik nahin hota he
 This type of construction is still used in very cheap models and in opera glasses and theater glasses
 keplarian prakaashiki kaa prayog karte hue ek behatar chhavi or ucch aavardhan praapt kiya ja saktaa he, isamen objective lens se praapt chhavi ko dhanatmak ipis lens se dekha jaataa he
 a disadvantage of this configuration is that the received image is inverted
 in kamiyon ko dur karne ke kai tareeke hai
 The Poro Prism telescopes are named after Italian optics scholar Ignazio Porro who patented the image correction system in 1854 and later improved in the 1890s by manufacturers such as Carl Zeiss
 is prakaar kii doorabeen jed ke aakaar ke dohare poro prism vaale vinyas kaa prayog chhavi ko sidhaa karne main karti hai
 Using this feature it is possible to make wide telescopes with objective lenses that are far enough away but are adjusted by the eyepiece
 poro prism dizin kaa ek or laabh yah he ki inamen prakaash path chota ho jaataa he jiske kaaran doorabeen kii vaastavik lambaai objective lens kii focal lambaai se choti ho jaati he tathaa donon objective ke bich kii badi hui duuri ke kaaran gaharaai kaa behatar ehsaas hota he
 The design by Ashley Victor Emil Dobres in 1870 resulted in telescope based prism
 adhikansh ruf prism aadhaarit doorabine yaa to ebbe-konig prism athwa shmit-pechan prism kaa prayog chhavi ko sidhaa karne tathaa prakaash path ko chota karne ke liye prayog karti hai
 These have objective lenses that are approximately in line with the eyepiece
 ruf prism dizine ki sahaayta se aise upkarnon kaa nirmaan ho paata he jo patale tathaa poro prism kii tulana main chote hote hai
 There is also a difference in the brightness of the image
 poro prism aadhaarit doorabeenon main samaan aavardhan, vastu aakaar tathaa samak prakaashiki gunvattta vaali ruf-prism aadhaarit doorabeenon ke mukaable adhik chamak vaali chhavi praapt hoti he, aisa isliye hota he kyonki ruf prism dizine main rupahali sataha kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jo ki prakaash ke sancharan ko 12% se 15% tak kam kar detii he
 Roof prism design telescopes also require more precision in the alignment of their optical elements
 aise main inaki keemat bad jaati he kyonki unki dizine unhen factory main hi kuch nishchit ghatakon ke saath ucch colimation par set kiye jane par aadhaarit hoti he
 In binoculars with poro prism, their prism sometimes has to be reoriented so that collimation can be recovered
 sthir rekhan vaali ruf dizine kaa arth yah hua ki unhen aamtaur par dobaaraa kabhi punah colimation kii aavashyaktaa nahin padegi
 The visionary is usually designed for a specific application
 ye vibhinn dizin kuch vishisht optical maapdand utpann karte hai ye maapdand hai: The ratio obtained by dividing the focal length of the eyepiece by the focal length of the objective is called the linear magnification power of the telescope
 For example, being in multiples of magnification power 7, it is as if the person watching is watching the object being viewed 7 times closely
 aavardhan kii maatra isapar nirbhar karti he ki doorabeen kis anuprayog ke liye banaayi gayi he
 Since the telescopes used in handhelds have low magnification, they are less sensitive to vibration
 adhik aavardhan hone se drishy kshetra chota ho jaataa he
 The diameter of the objective lens determines how much light can be collected to form an image
 yah sankhya sidhe pradarshan ko prabhavit karti he
 When the magnification and quality are equal, the larger the second number of binoculars, the brighter and clearer the image obtained is
 is prakaar ek 8X40 dwaara praapt chhaviyaan 8X25 kii tulana main adhik ujjwal tathaa spasht hongi, haalanki donon hi kisi chhavi ko aath guna hi bada karengi
 Large front lenses in 8x40 will produce large masses of light that go into the eyepiece
 Thus viewing from an 8x40 would be more comfortable than an 8x25
 yah aamtaur par millimetre main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 It is customary to classify telescopes as the diameter of the magnification x object, for example 7X50
 kisi doorabeen kaa drishy kshetra uske optical dizine dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 It is expressed by a linear value, such as how many feet of width will be seen when viewed from 1000 yards, or how many degrees of angular value can be seen
 objective dwaara praapt prakaash ko doorabeen ek punj ke rup main kendrit karti hai, exit pupil jiskaa vyas objective ke vyas ko aavardhan shakti se vibhajit karke praapt kiya jaataa he
 For best light reception and bright image, the exit pupil should be the size of the pupil of a fully expanded human eye that is about 7 mm and decreases with age
 agar doorabeen se nikalne vaala prakaash shanku us aankh kii putali ke aakaar se bada hoga jisame ise pravesh karnaa he to, putali ke aakaar ke atirikt ajo bhi prakaash he vah vyarth ho jaayegaa arthath uske madhyam se netron ko koi soochna nahin milegi
 din ke samay aankh kii putali lagbhag 3 mimi fail jaati he jo ki 7X21 doorabeen ke exit pupil ke baraabar hoti he
 Larger 7x50 binoculars create a larger light cone than the pupil, which becomes unusable during the day
 isliye ek bade upkaran ko saath lekar chalanaa vishesh upyogi nahin lagata
 haalanki, ek bada exit pupil se netra ko us sthaan par rakhana aasaan ho jaataa he jahaan se ise prakaash mil sake: prakaash shanku main kahin bhi aankh lagaayi ja sakati he
 This ease of setting the eye prevents the image from obscuring, which can be in the form of blackness or blurring when the path of light is partially blocked
 or, iskaa yah matlab bhi he ki chhavi ko jaldi se dhundha ja saktaa he jo pakshiyon yaa pashuon ke adhik gatisheel khelon ko dekhne ke dauraan mahatvapurn he
 Telescopes with narrow exit pupils can get fatigued quickly because the instrument needs to be right in front of the eye to get the correct image
 ant main, kai log apni doorabeenon kaa prayog shaam ke samay, dhundhalake ke samay, tathaa raat main karte hai jab unki putaliyaan badi hoti hai
 Thus, the daytime exit pupil is not always the most useful standard
 suvidha, upyog main aasaani or anuprayogon main vibhinnata ke liye badi doorabine jinamein bade exit pupil hon, santusht karne vaale vikalp hote hai, haalanki din main unki kshamta kaa puri tarah prayog nahin ho paata
 Eye relief is the distance between the exit pupil or eye point from the previous eyepiece lens
 yah vah duuri he jo dekhne vaale ko ipis se apni aankh ke bich rakhni hoti he jisase use ek spasht chhavi praapt ho sake
 The larger the focal length of the eyepiece, the greater the eye relief
 doorabeenon main ai relif kuch millimetre se lekar 2
5 centimetre athwa usase bhi adhik ho sakati he
 Eye relief is particularly important for glasses wearers
 chashma pahanane vaale vyakti kii aankh aamtaur se doorabeen ke ipis se dur hoti he jisaki vajah se yah aavashyak ho jaataa he ki doorabeen kii aai relif adhik ho jisase ki vah vyakti puraa drishy kshetra dekh sake
 Telescopes with small eye relief can be more difficult to use where they find it difficult to hold stability
 nikat focus duuri vah kam se kam duuri he jahaan doorabeen focus kar sakati hai
 This distance can range from 1 meter to 30 meters and depends on the design of the telescope
 chunki doorabeenon kaa prayog jin vastuon ke dekhne main kiya jaataa he ve kisi nishchit duuri par nahin hoti hai, atah unamem focus karne kii vyavastha hona aavashyak he jisase drushti tathaa objective lenson kii duuri ko badla ja sake
 Traditionally, two different arrangements have been used for focusing
 jin doorabeenon main "swatantra focus" kii vyavastha hoti he, unamem do alag-alag telescopon ko swatantra rup se unke ipis se focus kiya jaataa he
 Traditionally heavy field experiments, for example for military applications, have used independent focus telescopes
 chunki saamaanya prayogkarta doorabeenon ke donon tubon ko ek hi samaayojan se focus karnaa adhik suvidhajanak pate hai, ek duusare prakaar kii doorabine "kendriya focus" kaa prayog karti hai jinamein ek kendriya focus karne vaala pahiyaa laga hota he jisase donon tubon ko ek saath samyojit kiya ja saktaa he
 Additionally, the two eyepieces can also be adjusted to compensate for the difference in the viewer's eyes
 The focal change that occurs when the eyepiece is rotated into its mount is measured in the diopter, the prevailing unit of refraction power, so many times the eyepiece that can be adjusted is also called a "diopter"
 kisi vyakti vishesh ke liye yah samaayojan kiye jane ke baad alag alag duriyon par sthit vastuon ko dekhne ke liye focus karne vaale pahiye kii sahaayta se donon tubon ko focus kiya jaataa he or ipis ko dobaaraa samyojit nahin karnaa padataa he
 In most modern telescopes, the distance between the two different telescopes can also be changed with the help of an occupying structure that allows them to be set according to the distance between the two eyes of different people
 adhikansh vayaskon kii donon putliyon kii bich kii duuri ke anukool bani hoti he
 Many telescopes are "focus free" or "fixed focus", with no focusing mechanism
 unka dizine sthir drishy kshetra ke liye hota he jo apekshaakrit nikat kii vastuon se lekar anant tak hota he jisamen ek badi hyperfocal duuri hoti he
 These designs are considered to be compromised designs, it has convenience, but those things which are outside their range depending on their design, they are not seen properly
 kuch doorabine samaayojan yogya aavardhan pradaan karatin hai, inhen zum bainocular kehete hai, inkaa uddeshy prayogkarta ko ek hi doorabeen rakh kar usase "zum" liver kaa prayog karte hue vibhinn aavardhan str praapt karnaa hota he
 This requires a complex series of lens adjustments, as in zoom camera lenses
 ye dijin samjhauta athwa hatkandaa samajhe jate hai kyonki ye doorabeen main vishaal aakaar, jatilta tathaa najukta ko badha detii hai
 The complex optical path reduces the field of view and reduces the brightness at high zoom levels
 is prakaar ke modelon main zum kii puri paraas main, donon ankhon ke liye baraabar aavardhan rakhana aavashyak hota he tathaa ankhon ko tanaav va thakaan se bachaane ke liye samantaran bhi rakhana hota he
 Using image stabilization techniques in telescopes, the image can be saved from moving and high magnification can be used
 ve kal-purze jo chhavi kaa sthaan badalte hai ve urja se chalane vaale jiroscope athwa aisi yantriki se dridhtaapurvak sthir rakhe jate hai jo jiroscope yaa sthayitv jaanchane vaale yantro kii sahaayta se sanchalit ho, kai baar unhen aise lagaaya jaataa he ki ve kampan gati ke prabhaav ke vipareet kriya karte hai
 Stabilization can be started or stopped as desired by the user
 in takneekon se doorabeen ko 20X tak ke aavardhan ke saath haath main pakde ja sakane yogya banaaya ja saktaa he, saath hi kam shakti vaale upkarnon main chhavi sthirikaran kii gunvattta ko bhi badhaaya ja saktaa he
 There are also some drawbacks: After putting the best telescopes that do not use stabilization on the tripod, the picture obtained from them is much better, as well as stabilizing telescopes are expensive and heavier than telescopes that do not use their equivalent stabilization
 
 acchhee tarah se samaantarit doorabeen ko, maanav ankhon se dekhe or maanav mastishk dwaara sansaadhit kiye jane par, ek ekal, spashtatya tri-aiami chhavi dikhni chahie or aisa nahin laganaa chahie ki vah thode se alag drushtikon se do alag-alag tasviren dekhi ja rahi he
 In the absence of this adaptation, there may be delusional discomfort and visual fatigue, but the field of vision can still be seen as a whole
 doorabeen se dikhne vaale cinemai drishy jisamen do aanshik rup se aachhadit aath kii sankhya ke gole jaise dikhte hai, aisa vaastaviktaa main nahin hota he
 Misalignment is often corrected by moving the prisms slightly without moving the telescopes or by changing the position of the object, for which there are decentralized bangles outside the surface of the object
 aamtaur par sanrekhan kisi peshewar dwaara kiya jaataa he haalanki sanrekhan trutiyon ko pahchaanane tathaa unhen sanrekhit karne ke liye nirdesh internet par bhi mil jate hai
 An ordinary telescope uses 6 to 10 optical elements that are uniquely used, and glass-to-air contact surfaces can be up to 16, so telescope manufacturers have to use a variety of optical coatings for technical reasons The image quality obtained from the device can be enhanced
 pratek sataha par paravartan ke kaaran hone vaali prakaash kii haani ko anti-recolactive coating se kam kiya jaataa he
 The "lost" light inside the telescope through the anti-reflective coating, which can blur the image obtained, is minimized
 8x40 kii doorabeen jisamen acchhee optical coating kaa prayog hua ho, bina coating vaali 8x50 doorabeen se behatar tathaa ujjwal chhavi prastut kar sakati he
 a traditional lens coating material is magnesium fluoride which reduces reflectivity from 5% to 1%
 aadhunik lens coating jatil bahu-paraton se milakar banati he or keval 0
25% yaa usase kam pratibimbit karti he, saath hi adhiktam chamak or prakritik rangon ke saath ek acchhee chhavi detii he
 In binoculars with a roof prism, the light is split into two paths which are reflected from either side of the roof prism 
 aadha prakaash ruf kii sataha 1 se sataha 2 par paravartit hota he
 The remaining half of the light is reflected from surface 2 to surface 1
 is kaaran prakaash aanshik rup se polaraise ho jaataa he 
 iske aage hone vaale parvartanon se iskaa polaraise sadish badalata he parantu yah prayek path main phokalt pendulum ke sadrush badalata he
 When the light going on different paths is found, then the polarized vector of each path does not match
 polaraise sadishon ke bich ke kone ko fez shift yaa jyamitiya fez athwa beri fez kaha jaataa he
 The distribution of varying intensities in the image is obtained by colliding different paths with different geometric phases, reducing the contrast and resolution obtained with the poro prism system
 ruf prism kii ruf sataha par in avaanchit hastkshep prabhaav ko kam karne hetu kuch vishesh dividyutiya coating padaarthon kaa vaashp nirupan kiya jaataa he, in padaarthon ko fez-sudhaar coating athwa pi-coating kehete hai
 This coating corrects the difference in geometrical phase between two paths and converts the light coming from both paths into a single phase, which prevents image collisions due to collisions
 shmit-pechan ruf prism athwa ebbe-konig ruf prism kaa prayog kar rahi doorabine fez coating se vishesh rup se labhanvit hoti hai
 Poro prism based telescopes do not reassemble the light rays coming from different paths and hence do not have any special benefit from phase coating
 shmit-pechan ruf prism kaa prayog kar rahi doorabeenon main ruf prism kii satahon ko darpan coating kiya jaataa he taaki uski kisi ek sataha par pad rahaa prakaash yadi seemaant kone se kam par pade to uskaa sampoorn aatanrik paravartan na ho jaye
 darpan coating ke bina adhikansh prakaash kii kshati ho jaaegi
 shmit-pechan ruf prism main aluminium darpan coating athwa rajat darpan coating kaa prayog hota he
 Silver mirrors were coated in older designs but were oxidized in unsealed telescopes and lost reflectivity
 baad main bina sil kii gayi diginon main aluminium darpan coating kaa istemaal kiya gaya kyonki yah dhoomil nahin padataa he, haalanki yah chaandi kii tulana main kam paravartaneeyata detaa he
 Modern designs use either aluminum or silver
 aadhunik ucch gunvattta vaali diginon main chaandi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, inamen nitrogen athwa argon se bhar kar sil kar diya jaataa he jisase rajat darpan coating kabhi dhoomil nahin padatin
 Telescopes with poro prisms and roof prisms that use the abbe-könig roof prism do not have to use a mirror coating as these prisms achieve 100% reflectivity from the entire internal reflection
 daai-electric darpan coating kaa prayog shmit-pechan ruf prism main daai-electric darpan kaa prabhaav paidaa karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Template: To create a Jargon non-metallic die-electric mirror coating, elements with high and low refraction index are deposited alternately on the reflective surface of the roof prism
 prayek ekal bahuparat prakaash, ek patale aavriti punj ko paravartit karti he jisase aisi kai paraten, isliye safed prakaash ko paravartit karne ke liye bhinn rangon main samyojit anekon bahuparat prakaash kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This multilayer coating increases reflectivity by acting as a distributed Bragg converter on the surface of the prism
 ek acchhee tarah se dizin kii gayi daai-electric coating, drishy prakaash varnakram main 99% se adhik paravartaneeyata pradaan karti he
 This reflectivity is much better than aluminum mirror coating or silver mirror coating
 poro prism tathaa ruf prism vaali doorabine jo ebbe-konig ruf prism kaa prayog karti hai, inhen daai-electric coating kaa prayog nahin karnaa padataa kyonki ye prism sampoorn aatanrik paravartan kaa prayog karte hue ati ucch paravartaneeyata praapt kar lete hai
 The presence of a coating is usually marked on the telescope by the following words: haath main pakad kar prayog kii ja sakane vaali doorabine theatre main prayukt 3X10 opera glass se lekar baahar istemaal kii ja sakane vaali 7 se 12 meter vyas aavardhan or 30 se 50 mimi objective lens vaali hoti hai
 In many tourist places, coin-operated binoculars are mounted on the stand, with the help of which they can see that tourist attraction closely
 britain main 20 pence main aamtaur par doorabeen se do minute dekhne ko miltaa he jabaki sanyukt rajya main ek yaa do quarter main dedh se dhai minute tak dekhne diya jaataa he
 In many telescopes the reticle appears within the field of view to find the range
 yah paimaana, oonchai gyaat hone par dekhi ja rahi vastu kii duuri kaa anumaan lagane main sahaayta karata he
 In the ordinary 7X50 telescope of sailors, the distance between the scale signs express about 5 mill
 ek mil, 1000 meter kii duuri se dekhe jane par ek meter oonchi vastu ke sheersh tathaa aadhaar ke bich banane vaale kone ko kaha jaataa he
 Thus the equation for estimating the distance from an object at a known height would be as follows: jahaan: On a simple 5 mill scale, a lighthouse looking 3 signs high would actually be 120 meters high and 8000 meters away
 doorabeen ke sainya upyog kaa ek lanbaa itihaas he
 Galilean design was widely in use by the end of the 19th century and Poro prism design began to be used thereafter
 saamaanya sainya prayog ke liye banaayin gayi doorabine apni asainya samakakshon ke mukaable kahin adhik majboot banaayin jaati hai
 Independent focus is used in place of delicate central focus in military use, making it easy to make the telescope impervious to the environment and providing effective environmental adaptation
 sainya doorabeenon ke prijmon par aluminium kii atirikt coating kii jaati he jisase ki bhig jane par bhi unki parvartaneeyata kam naa ho
 Another used form of binoculars is the "trench telescope", which is a mixture of binoculars and periscopes, it is used in the detection of artillery, while using it, the soldier can see it while keeping his head below the munder
 He gets protection
 sheet yuddh kaal kii sainya doorabeenon main kai baar pasive samvedak lagaakar unhen sakriy infrared utsarjanon ko dekhne laayak bana diya jaataa he, jabaki aadhunik doorabeenon main nishpadak lage hote hai jo unhen leisure kirnon ko hathiyaar ke rup main prayog kiye jane se roktaa he
 In addition, telescopes designed for military use also have a stereometric reticle to estimate range
 samudr main prayog kiye jane hetu sainya tathaa asainya upyogon ke liye alag-alag doorabine uplabdh hai
 The telescopes that can be held in the hand are 5X or 7X, but they have large prisms as well as eyepieces that provide great comfort to the eyes
 yah optical sangyojan doorabeen ko ankhon ke saapeksh compit hone par praapt chhavi ko dhundhala hone athwa aspasht hone se bachaata he
 Large, high-magnification models with large objective lenses are made usable on a stand
 bahut badi nausainik range-finder doorabeenon kaa prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he, parantu 20 sadi ke uttarardh kii takanic ne inkaa anuprayog anaavashyak bana diya
 Telescopes are widely used by amateur astronomers; Their wide field of view makes them particularly useful for comet and supernova watchers and for general observation
 70 mimi tathaa isse badi range kii kuch doorabine prithvi sambandhi avlokan ke anukool hoti hai; vaastavik khagoleey doorabeenon kii dizine main prijmon kaa prayog prakaash sampreshan badha kar chhavi ko sahi rup se pradarshit karne main hota he
 Such binoculars have replaceable eyepieces that can increase or reduce magnification and are not designed for waterproofing or asymmetric use
 seres, neptune, palas, titan, tathaa brihaspati ke gallilian chandramaa, jo nangi ankhon se nahin dikhaai dete, doorabeen kii sahaayta se aasaani se dekhe ja sakate hai
 However, Uranus and Vesta, which can be seen without any help in the pollution free sky, can be easily seen with the help of binoculars
 10X15 kii doorabine +10 se +11 ke maan tak hi simit hoti hai or yah akaash kii sthiti va prekshak ke anubhav par bhi nirbhar karata he
 Commonly available binoculars, such as interemonia, davida, europa, and hygeia in rare circumstances, are rarely visible
 isi prakaar gallilian tathaa titon ko chhodkar grahon ke chandramaa tathaa boune grah pluto va iris adhikansh doorabeenon se bamushkil hi nazar aate hai
 Open clusters in deep sky objects look grand, such as the bright double cluster in the Perus planetarium, and spherical clusters, such as the M13 of Hercules, can be easily seen
 niharikaon main, segiterius main M17 va signs main uttari amareeki niharika enjisi 7000 ko bhi saralata se dekha ja saktaa he
 An important fact of low light and astronomical vision is the ratio of magnification power and the diameter of the optical lens
 kam aavardhan hone par drushti kshetra bad jaataa he jisase gahare akashiya vastuon, jaise akaash ganga, niharikayen, tathaa tara samoohon ko dekhnaa asana ho jaataa he, haalanki bade exit pupil se praapt prakaash ko umrdaraj anveshak puri tarah se nahin dekh pate hai kyonki 50 varsh se adhik umr waalon kii aakhen virale hi 5 mimi se zyada failati hai
 The large exit pupil makes it difficult to detect blurred objects due to the contrast in the background of the night sky, except in areas where optical pollution is negligible

 However, astronomical objects of the Messier catalog or of eighth magnitude and above can be easily seen from usable handheld telescopes in the 30 to 40 mm range
 phir bhi khagoleey prayog ke liye bade objective vaali doorabine hi acchhee rahati hai kyoki unase praapt prakaash kii maatra adhik hone ke kaaran dhundhlee vasteen bhi aasaani se dikhaai detii hai
 Due to their high magnification and heavy weight, it is necessary to use these telescopes mounted on a stand to see a stable image

 During his long career, Qadri exchanged a wide range of cultural figures, including Surielist painter René Magriti, Nobel laureate Heinrich Ball, and architect Le Qurbizier
 ball ne ek samay kaha tha, "apane chitra ke saath sohan kadri dhyaan shabd ko uski fashneble ruchi se mukt karte hai or ise iske uchit mul tak waapas laate hai

 He went from there to Karnaul and then to Tibet, where he stayed in Buddhist monasteries for several months, living between spiritualists and forest dwellers
 Meanwhile, his mother sent a cousin and wrestler to bring him home
 He tried to escape twice, but was forced to return
 Ultimately, Qadri stuck to his stand
 His refusal to see the work of the farm has dashed his mother's hopes of furthering the family
 Qadri was the first boy from his village to pass matriculation, but instead of completing a three-year undergraduate degree from Ramgarhia College, he took art training from photographer Pyara Singh at a studio in Jalandhar in Punjab
 1952 main pyaara singh ke england main aakar basane ke baad, sohan jalandhar chhodkar mumbai gayi
 Modernity was an urban concept and in order to pursue his interest in the field of art, he felt that he would have to leave village life behind
 Qadri settled in Parel and worked as an immovable photographer at an early Bollywood studio in Andheri, Mumbai

 Anand continued to support young talent from all over India and became the first great patron of Qadri
 Anand arrived in Phagwara in 1963 with Pierre Jinneret, an architect and cousin of architect Le Corbijier, who took a painting for his collection
 anand or jinnerat ne kadri ko unke kaaryon ko punjab or haryana ke nae-nae bane rajdhani nagar chandigarh, jisaki le korbeijiyar ne dizin kii, laane ke liye aamantrit kiya

 is dauraan sohan ne sufi shikshak ke prati bhakthi kii nishaani ke rup apane antim naam singh ko hataakar kadri rakh liya
 After receiving critical acclaim, Qadri started painting seriously and teaching himself about a Parisian school in a small town like Jalandhar
 As is often the case with artists living outside European artistic centers, modernity was seen as a secondary material - especially in the eyes of print media
 Sohan educated himself by reading Studio International, Illustrated Weekly of India and Modern Review as well as lectures and books

 Qadri began to work figuratively and gradually moved towards the abstract and eventually gave up painting to seek the experiential
 He says, "when i start on a canvas, first clear the mind from all images
" They are scattered in a primitive vacancy
 main mahasoos karata hum ki keval khalipan ko hi canvas ke shunya ke saath samvaad sthapit karnaa chahie

 " is avadhi ke dauraan kadri ne chitrakala kii paddati viksit kii, jiskaa vah abhi bhi upyog karte hai
 They divided the pure color into three categories or parts: black or dark brown, hot or cold and light

 In 1962, a second exhibition was held at Sridharani Gallery in New Delhi, Qadri
 After the Shridharani exhibition and with the help of Randhawa and Dr
 Anand in Delhi, many galleries took interest in his work
 At that time, Indian artists largely found patrons among some Indians interested in modern art, as well as diplomats or the migrant community
 kadri kii shuruaati kala ke sangrahakartaaon main bharat main belgium kaunsul or canada or france ke rajdoot the
 On Anand's encouragement, Qadri decided to travel outside India and immersed himself in full-time painting

 Qadri managed to get an imaginary wedding invitation in Nairobi, which enabled him to obtain a passport, which was a difficult task at the time

 For the remainder of the trip he traded his paintings for food and whiskey

 He hoped to have their exhibition in Kenya
 When they landed in Mombasa, port officials have thrown a crate of pictures of Qadri on the sidewalk, as they could not afford a porter

 Once in Nairobi, he contacted Elimo Najau, a Kenyan cultural figure and frequently visited Delhi

 Najau, a catalyst of contemporary culture, founded two nonprofit galleries, named Pa-ya-pa in Nairobi and Kibo in Marangu, Tanzania, where regular exhibitions of both African and international artists were held
 
 Najou immediately recognized Qadri's work, which he saw at Delhi's Kunika Art Gallery

 Bhatia agreed to use the embassy machinery to sponsor the show and promote the exhibition
 Bhatia bought the first painting at a price of 75 pounds
 All the pictures were sold on the show and it was discussed all over Nairobi
 The show was followed by a second exhibition at the Stanley Gallery of the American-owned and renovated Stanley Hotel, which was equally successful
 africa main apane pravaas ke baad kadri jurikh chale gayi
 a former girlfriend arranged for his architect friend George Plang to sit in his house
 Qadri and Plang got their minds and Plang gave them the keys to a huge villa called Tiljenkamp of a colleague
 At Tilgenkamp, qadri prepares for his first European exhibition, which takes place in November 1966 at the Romain Louis Gallery in Brussels
 The exhibition was organized with the help of respected Swiss art critic Mark Kuhn, although it featured twenty-three paintings, but only one sale
 haalanki unke paas kaaphi kam paisa tha, kadri ne paint karnaa jari rakhaa
 ek din, kuhan ne suriyilast rene magrity kaa kalakaar ke studio main hi saakshaatkaar liya to kadri ko usamen shaamil hone ke liye kaha

 jab kadri ne unase kaha ki vah shimla main shatranj champion rah chuke hai to magrity ne unhen ek game ke liye chunauti di he or phir jaldi hi unhen haraa diya
 Qadri sold five of his paintings to a couple in Montreal, who returned to Canada to open a gallery, before taking a road trip from Brussels to Paris with Kuhn to meet first patron, Mulk Raj Anand, and Indian painter Syed Hyder Raza
 Were on the way

 When he returned to Zurich, Qadri received an invitation to an international artists' camp in Khuslin, Poland, where he was given temporary accommodation, food and painting materials for two months

 He also met renowned printmaker Krishna Reddy, who was working with his wife Judy Reddy and British painter Stanley William Hayter
 is samay ke dauraan, kadri ne canvas par impasto oil se painting band kar di or kaagaj ke saath prayog kiya
 Although the paintings made from oil sold better, the paper pictures looked softer and looked more feminist and more suited to those works which developed outside the state of meditation
 ve kehete hai, "jeevon kii gahari avasthaaon ko prayaason se baahar nahin nikaala ja saktaa"
 "jab main syaahi or rangon ke saath kaam karata hum, main canvas ke saath ladata nahin hum

 Qadri initially lived with Dr
 Kaj Bork, chairman of the Danish Art Society, but, as he had once arranged several exhibitions, he needed a studio
 bork kii beti ne kadri kaa dow fritz schimitto se parichay karaayaa, jo ek sanakee rais the or khud ek bade vila main rahete the
 Scimitto was an economist in the Danish Ministry, who worked for thirty-five years in the same office in the same chair, calculating Denmark's per capita income

 Located in the Hellerp area of copenhagen near the Indian embassy, that villa was filled with birds, fish, dogs and turtles flying in the free sky
 dhul se dhanke kai upree kamaron main se ek main vishaal khilonaa railgadee thi or duusare main schimitto kii maan ke kapade thik usee tarah rakhe hue the, jis din vah mari thim
 Scimitto only asked where he was from, what his occupation was and whether he could paint in the villa's contrasting environment 
 jab kadri ne kaha ki ve aisa kar sakate hai, to schimitto ne unhen rahane ke liye aamantrit kiya or kadri ek sankshipt avadhi ko chhodkar vahaan atharah varshon tak rahe
 In 1973, a few years after settling in Copenhagen, Qadri met his most important second mentor and Nobel laureate Henrik Ball
 He was introduced to a respected writer during a show at the Bodo Galuab Gallery in Cologne, Germany
 Ball bought several paintings and wrote about Qadri's work
 Also during this period Qadri took over an old gun factory obligation with American drug addict painters Linda Wood and Pere Bacho and helped to get acquainted with a free city called Christian, which still exists in Copenhagen

 haalanki unhone is khulepan kaa mazaa liya, lekin yah kaam karne ke liye ek asambhav vaataavaran tha
 Six months later, Qadri returned to Hellerp, where he remained until Dr
 Shimitto's death in 1986
 Eventually he moved to the government-sponsored artists' residence, where he still lives
 haalanki ve canvas par kaam karte rahe, par 1970 ke madhya se kaagaj kadri kaa pasandida madhyam ban gaya
 ve kehete hai, "mujhe sadaa ek madhyam kii talash thi, jahaan prayaas anaavashyak ho
 jivan kii gahari avasthaaen prayaas se baahar nahin laayi jaatin
" ve kehete hai
 They say that their work is not of philosophical nature, it should not be to stimulate the process of thinking
 On the contrary, his aim is to capture the thought process, as in meditation, which Qadri practiced and taught everyday
 mote taur par kadri ek rang vaali satahon par kaam karte he, jisamen ve chhed or daanedaar binduon ke saath pravesh karte hai
 The Buddhist scholar Robert Thurman described his dots and grainy shapes as "bright bubbles of energy"
 kadri kaagaj ko in chihnon ek teen aiami sataha main badal dete hai
 Despite the fact that they live in northern Europe, the spirit of Indian ethos is fully present in their art
 unke rang chamakdaar- sinduri laal, mayuri nile, gaharaa santara rang or yahaan tak ki gaharaa kaala or bhura hai or saafe taur par bhartiya hai
 The color is faded and seems to be seeping through the paper
 rangon dwaara paidaa kiya gaya kampan anant hai or chhavi ke bheetar ke sthaan or darshak ke bahya sthaan ke bich kii seemaa ko todta he
 Qadri's artistic productivity has grown during the 1980s and 1990s and he was invited to exhibitions in Los Angeles, Copenhagen, Nairobi, New Delhi, Mumbai, Singapore and New York
 haalanki unhone kabhi shaadi nahi kii, par do partneron, ek kerala kii isai or duusare ek anya fin se apane teen bachche ko paalane main madad kii
 yah vahi samay tha, jab unhone bharat ke punjab main ek pracheen vyapaar maarg par ek aadhyatmik mritika kala pariyojna, ek gyaan stambh yaa gyaan stupa banane kii yojana banani shuru kii
 ye sanrachanaayen antat desh kii kai acre jameen par banengi or inhen gyaan or shanti ke liye samarpit kiya jayega
 stupa kaa nirmaan pragati par he
 Along with creating his own art, Qadri has continued to teach meditation lessons to advanced level students in Scandinavia
 kadri ne apane puure kariyar ke dauraan safaltaapurvak alag-alag samskritiyon main jivan jiya
 vah kehete hai, "main apane aap ko ek jagah, raashtra yaa samudaay tak simit nahin karnaa chahta tha
 "" My attitude towards life is universal and so is my art
 " It is a privilege to introduce the knowledge and art of Sohan Qadri, even in such a small form
 The goal of such art is not just to generate theory
 It cannot have any kind of purpose
 yah apane bhagidaar ko vah jeevant aayam kholane ke liye aamantrit karata he, jahaan se yah paidaa hota he
 It flourishes in the field of the artist's experience of reality
 vah bhram ke madhyam se dekhne ke baad shuddh saundarya ke rup main vikhandit ho jaataa he or mukt udaan bharta he
 Real freedom does not entrench itself, it simultaneously frees itself and therefore engages illusion out of joy and love for others
 dhokhaa de rahaa bhram mukti pradaan karne ke jaadu main tabdeel ho jaataa he
 Knowledge leaves the artist in the ocean of pleasure
 anand anayas dusron ko pyaar bhari ankhon se dekhtaa he, aage unamem bhi anand kii chaah taiyaar karata he
 The artist imagines a place of beauty, where his experience can touch the experiences of another
 dow robert thuraman There are artists
 tantric kalakaar hote hai
 As far as i know, there are no tantric yogis who are artists as well
 Sohan Qadri is an exception
 vah ek asaadhaaran kalakaar he
 He is a master of the art of yoga
 vah painting kii kala main nipun guru he
 He is a practicing tantric yogi who periodically performs forbidden foods, eating alcohol, and indulging in adultery
 is maamle main kanoon tod kar vah ek tarah se vidhayak ban jate hai
 To become an idolist one must know how to create images
 To break the law, one has to be a learned lawyer
 kadri ek vidwaan aadmi he
 He is a saint, from whom a halo arises
 unhen ek jaali sant ke rup main bataane kii koshish karo yaa benakaab karo or vah ek mahaan kalakaar ke rup main ubharegaa
 unki kala ko chal ghoshit karne kii koshish karo or ve ek mahaan vidwaan ke rup main ubharenge
 unke gyaan ko jhootha sabit karne kii koshish karen or yah sabit ho jaayegaa ki unamem ye sabhi teen-sadhuta, saundaryashastra or gyaan maujuud hai
 There is no doubt in my mind that Sohan Qadri is emerging as a rare and original partner
 aap unki chitrakaari ko yantron yaa mandalon ke rup main dekh sakate hai or unhen mantron jaise shabdon ke rup main varnit sakate hai
 You can see a symbolic representation of 'bhujang-satta' or Shakti named Kundalini in his painting, which is said to be in a curved figure at the end of the spinal cord
 aap unki chitrakaari ko sirf rup yaa rang ke rup main dekh sakate hai or unka ek shuddh kala ke rup main anand uthaa sakate hai
 It does not matter from which angle you are looking, but it reveals a great view, which is mysticism
 iske saundaryashastra main, bhaavana ke saath sakha kaa milan charmotkarsh tak pahunchataa he
 Sohan Qadri can be a guru
 vah ek tantric baba ho sakate he
 He can be anything unrelated to art
 mere liye vah ek vilakshan kalakaar he
 Ajit Mukherjee's book Tantra Kala states, "it is amazing that many great Indian artists eventually became saints

 acharya hajariprasad dvivedi ke anusaar sanskrit main bhi niabandh kaa sahitya he
 Theological theories were logically interpreted in those essays of ancient Sanskrit literature
 unamem vyaktitv kii visheshta nahin hoti thi
 But the essays of the present day are exactly opposite from the Sanskrit essays
 unamem vyaktitv yaa vaiyaktikta kaa gun sarvapradhan he
 Freedom from the stereotypes of history-perception tradition
 niabandh kii vidha kaa sambandh isi itihaas-bodh se he
 This is why the main feature of the essay is the publication of personality
 niabandh kii sabase acchhee paribhaasha he- There is an overarching flaw in this definition
 lekin niabandh kaa rup sahitya kii anya vidhaon kii apeksha itnaa swatantra he ki uski sateek paribhaasha karnaa atyant kathin he
 Essay in the languages of the whole world has been recognized as the creative mode of literature in the modern era itself
 aadhunik yug main hi madhyayugin dharmik, saamaajik roodhiyon se mukti kaa dwaar dikhaai padaa he
 The essay has a deep connection with this liberation
 hajariprasad dvivedi ke anusaar- Thus the essayist has a special importance in the essay
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne likhaa he: This means that no concrete structure-rules and elements can be instructed in an essay which is necessary for the essayist to follow
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki niabandh ek aisi kalakriti he jiske niyam lekhak dwaara hi avishkrut hote hai
 In the essay, there is an expression of personality in a simple, simple and frank manner
 'hindi sahitya kosh' ke anusaar: Thus the essay has two special qualities- niabandh kaa aarambh kaise ho, bich main kya ho or ant kis prakaar kiya jaae, aise kisi nirdesh or niyam ko maanane ke liye nibandhkaar baadhya nahin he
 But this does not mean that the essay is a disorderly creation and the essayist is a disorderly person
 nibandhkaar apni prerana or vishay vastu kii sambhaavnaaon ke anusaar apane vyaktitv kaa prakaashan or rachana kaa sanghathan karata he
 For this reason, style has a special importance in the essay

 ’’ in paribhaashaon se spasht he ki shiksha or manovigyaan donon kaa sambandh maanav vyavhaar se he
 Education changes human behavior and makes it perfect
 manovigyaan maanav vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he
 Thus, it is natural to have a relationship between education and psychology, but in this regard it provides the basis for psychology
 shiksha ko apane prayek kaary ke liye manovigyaan kii sweekruti praapt kerani padati he
 Bn Jha has rightly written - "whatever education does and the way it is done, it has to depend on psychological discoveries
 ’’ Psychology has gained this place because it has revolutionized all fields of education by influencing them
 is sandarbh main rain ke ye sargarbhit vaakya ullekhneey he- All this has been possible due to the use of education psychology
 sankshep main manovigyaan ne shiksha ke kshetra main nimnlikhit yogadan kiya he- The problems of education are related to its objectives, subject matter, means and methods
 manovigyaan in chaaron kshetron main samasyaon ko sulajhane main sahaayta pradaan karata he
 Psychology helps in understanding the objectives of education as follows
 shiksha kii vishaywastu ko samajhane va uskaa nirdhaaran chaatr ke vikaas ke anuroop karne main manovigyaan kaa mahatvapurn yogadan hota hai
 What is the content for which class of students? What kind of indirect course that does not adversely affect the mental health of students, etc
 Psychology addresses important questions
 manovigyaan kii sahaayta se maanavjaati ko vishwa ke kalyaan hetu prayukt kar sakate he
 Psychology helps in understanding the means of education, because- manovigyaan shikshan kii vidhiyon ke bare main gyaan teen prakaar se detaa he - Davis has discussed the importance of education psychology in this way - psychology has contributed significantly in the field of education by analyzing students' aptitudes and the variations found in them
 isane vidyalayan varsho main chaatr kii vruddhi evam vikaas ke dhang ke bare main gyaan pradaan karke bhi yogadan diya he
 Blair has stated the importance of education psychology in the following words - vibhinn lekhakon ne shiksha manovigyaan kii bhinn-bhinn paribhaashaayen di he
 Therefore, certainly nothing can be said about the field of education psychology
 iske atirikt shiksha manovaigyanik ek nayaa tathaa panapata vigyaan he
 Its field is uncertain and assumptions are secret
 iske kshetron main abhi bahut si khoj ho rahi he or sambhav he ki shiksha manovigyaan kii nai dharanaen, niyam or siddhant praapt ho jaye
 Its sense is that the field of education psychology and problems are uncertain and variable
 chaahe kuch bhi ho nimnlikhit kshetra yaa samasyaon ko shiksha manovigyaan ke kaary kshetra main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Crow and Crow - "the content of education psychology is related to the conditions affecting learning
 ’’ Education psychology is being placed in the category of behavioral sciences
 vigyaan hone ke kaaran iske adhyayan main bhi anek vidhiyon kaa vikaas hua
 These methods are scientific

 kro va kro ne likhaa he ‘‘jivan itihaas vidhi kaa mukhya uddeshy kisi kaaran kaa nidaan karnaa he
 ’’ bahirdarshan vidhi ko avlokan yaa nirikshan vidhi bhi kaha jaataa he

 In the inspection method, the inspector observes the behavior being studied and based on that, he makes his perception about the subject
