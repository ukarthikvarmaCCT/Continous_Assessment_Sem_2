 Descriptive linguistics has developed here in Western countries, especially in the United States
 kisi bhashaa me vibhinn kaalon main parivartanon par vichaar karnaa evam un parivartanon ke sambandh main siddhanto kaa nirmaan hi aitihaasik bhashavigyaan kaa uddeshy hota he
 The basic difference of the descriptive method is that the descriptive method is unicameral, where the historical method is bicameral
 sankrut bhashaa kii pracheenta ne aitihaasik paddati kii ore bhashavigyaniyon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya
 The main formulation of 'philology' was the comparative study of the languages of ancient texts
 mukhyatah sanskrit, german, greek, lotin jaisi bhashaaon par hi vidwaanon kaa dhyaan kendrit rahaa
 Frederick Auguste Wolf drew the attention of scholars to the historical method in the year 1777 itself
 vastutah, kisi bhi bhashaa ke vikasaatmak rup ko samajhane ke liye aitihaasik paddati kaa sahaara lenna hi padegaa
 What has changed in Old Hindi or Medieval Hindi and Modern Hindi can be explained only by historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati dwaara do yaa do se adhik bhashaaon kii tulana kii jaati he
 It can also be called a mixed method, because the basis of both the descriptive method and the historical method is taken
 vivaran ke liye kisi ek kaal ko nishchit karnaa hota he or tulana ke liye kam-se-kam do bhashaaon kii apeksha hoti he
 Thus, comparative method can be called the sum of descriptive method and historical method
 tulanaatmak paddati kinhin do bhashaaon par lagu ho sakati he
 For example, comparison is also done in Indian languages - Bhojpuri etc
 Or comparative study of hindi-english, hindi-russian, hindi-persian is also done
 arthath isamen kshetragat seemaa nahin he
 Scholars like William Jones, France Bopp, Maxmüller, Curtius, August Schlikher, have made significant contributions to the development of comparative linguistics

 Linguistics, like other branches of science, has experimental aspects, which require systems of experimentation and laboratory
 bhinn-bhinn yantric prayogon ke dwaara uccharnatmak swanvigyaan, bhautik swanvigyaan or shravnatmak swanvigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 It is also called experimental phonology, mechanical phonology or laboratory phonology

 When the disputed cases of any two states are settled by Panch decision, it is called international arbitration
 antarrashtriya vivaad teen anya prakaar se bhi niptaya ja saktaa he- by mutual agreement; kisi tisare vyakti kii sahaayta se; tathaa By mediation
 pracheen yunaan ke nagar rajyon ke aapasi sambandhon main madhya nirnay kaa vishesh mahatv tha
 We are aware that within seven centuries there were more than eighty important Panch decisions in this way
 madhya yug main bhi vivachan ke udhaaharan hamen baraabar milte hai
 But arbitration came into vogue especially in the late 18th century
 san 1794 i
 main sanyukt rajya america or great britain ke madhya ek sandhi hui jo je sandhi ke naam se prasiddh he
 From that time onwards, the spirit of peaceful settlement continued to progress, although there were many obstacles
 san 1794 tathaa 1913 i
 ke bich do sau se adhik panchat hue jinamein san 1872 kaa albama panchat mukhyat ullekhneey he
 Initially arbitration depended on the will of the parties
 kisi vivadagrast maamle main vibhinn pakshon dwaara swechhapurvak kiye gaye prasanvida par hi vivachan aadhaarit hota tha
 Later, an attempt was made to make arbitration compulsory and preferred in such a way that the various parties are obliged to settle the dispute in future by arbitration
 saath hi yah bhi praytn hua ki pehle kii anek vyaktigat sandhiyon ko hataakar ek vyapak samuhik sandhi ho jo sabhi vyaktigat sandhiyon kaa sthaan grahan kar len
 Attempts were made in this direction at the Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907 AD
 san 1899 i
 ke abhismay kaa prayojan tha ki samast antarrashtriya vivaadon kaa nipataara maitreepurn dhang se ho or is kaary ke nimitt vivachan nyaayalay kii ek sthaayee sanstha sthapit kii jaae jo sabhi kii pahunch ke bheetar ho
 Arbitration, International Court of Appeal, Permanent Arbitration Court and Arbitration Procedure were arranged in this convention by 61 paragraphs
 san 1907 i
 main pratham abhismay par punarvichaar hua or anuchhedon kii sankhya 61 se badhaakar 96 ho gai
 But the plan for compulsory arbitration was unsuccessful and the First World War ended the plan
 phir bhi, vyaktigat sandhiyon dwaara vivachan kii parampara main vikaas hua or san 1902 se 1932 i
 tak hegg vivachan nyaayalay ne bees panchat die
 There was no rule in the Convention of the League of Nations which would obligate member states for compulsory arbitration
 antarrashtriya nyaayalay kii sthapana se anivaary kshetradhikaar kii sambhaavna kaa maarg prashast hua parantu vaastavik rup main vivachan se iskaa prayojan na tha
 In 1928, the General Assembly of the League of Nations made a constitution to settle international disputes peacefully, in which only political disputes were required to be settled by arbitration
 san 1929 main america rajyon kii ek samuhik sandhi hui jiske dwaara sarvangpurn amareeki vivachan kii vyavastha kii gai
 Apart from this, the institution of arbitration remained based on personal treaties
 prarambh main bahudhaa kisi anyadeshi rajya ke pramukh ko vivachak chun liya jaataa tha
 According to the rules, the head of state had the right to hand over the arbitration work to someone else
 parinaam yah hua ki vivachan kaary rajya ke adhikarigan karte the or vivachan main nirnay vastut kanoonee aadhaar par na hokar raajnneeti ke rang main rangi hui madhyasthata kaa rup grahan karne laga
 Hence this form of process came to an end
 vartmaan paddati main ek nyaayaadhikaran bana diya jaataa he jisamen prayek paksh dwaara chune gaye vichaarkon kii sankhya baraabar hoti he
 The arbitrator elects the main arbitrator
 nyaayaadhikaran kii karrwai mukhya vivachak kii adhyakshata main hoti he
 If there is a difference of opinion in the election of the chief arbitrator, then the election process is done according to special rules
 vivaachakon, visheshkar mukhya vivachak, ke nirvachan main praaia kathinaayee hoti he jiske kaaran vivachan ke nirdesan main vilamb ho jaataa he or kabhi-kabhi to nirdesan ho hi nahin paata
 To overcome this difficulty, a permanent arbitration court was established in 1899 AD
 yah nyaayalay vastav main un vyaktiyon kii suchi maatr he jo vivachan kaary ke yogya hai tathaa uske liye sahamat hai
 Together, some rules remain, according to which different parties can create arbitral tribunals in individual cases by choosing the arbitrator from the above list
 prashasan kaary ke liye nyaayalay se sanlagn ek karyaalay tathaa sthaayee samiti he
 In 1920, a permanent International Court of Justice was established, but a court of arbitration remained
 jab koi do rajya kisi vivaad kaa vivachan ke nimitt nirdesan karte hai tab nirdesan kaa pravishay tathaa sharten sandhi patr athwa tadnurup anya lekh patr dwaara nishchit ho jaati hai
 If no rules or principles are mentioned in the treaty, then the action of arbitration is in accordance with the rules of practice
 san 1899 i
 main prakriya sambandhi bahut se niyam bana die gaye the parantu unka prayog tabhi hota he jab sandhipatr main aavashyak niyam na likhe hon
 Thus, all the process related things can be decided by the parties themselves
 vivachan prakriya do bhaagon main vibhajit he-likhit pariprashn tathaa maukhik karrwai; The action of negotiation is regularly kept secret; nijee kshamta sambandhi prashnon kaa nirnay karne kii shakti nyaayaadhikaran ko praapt he; The tribunals' discussions are confidential; nirnay bahumat se hota he; Arbitration must be objective; panchat antim nirnay he parantu usase keval vivaad vaale paksh hi baadhya hote hai
 Arbitral tribunal decisions are often not motivated by a sense of respect for the law, just as court decisions are
 madhyasth nyaayaadhikaran bahudhaa pakshon ko santusht karne kii ichha se prabhavit hote hai, na ki vastut kanoonee niyamon kaa paalan karne kii udbhaavna se
 The tribunal's decision often does not mention the tips on which their decisions are based, nor does it consider them obliged to consider precedents
 jab nyaayaadhikaran nirdesan main di gai adhikaar seemaa kaa ulanghan karata he yaa pratyaksh rup se nyaay ke vipareet kaary karata he athwa yah siddh ho jaataa he ki amuk panchat chal, kapat yaa bhrashtachar dwaara praapt kiya gaya he yaa panchat ke niabandh aspasht hai, tab vivachan nirnay doshapurn samajha jaataa he or us disha main vibhinn paksh uski manyata dene ke liye baadhya nahin hote
 In 1831 AD, the arbitration of the Emperor of Holland was declared invalid on the grounds that there was a violation of the authority limit

 In a hydraulic system, power is transmitted with the help of a liquid

 The main parts of this system are: pumping machine, hydraulic motor and equipment for mixing two main parts
 chunki pump karne kaa tantra taral daab ko preshit karata he, isliye yantra ko preshi kehete hai

 The power is transmitted to the conductor shaft by the transport of oil between the pump propellant and the turbine rotor

 Nowadays the fluidized mode of power transmission is being used more to operate the device

 Oil is sent at high pressure by one or more pumps
