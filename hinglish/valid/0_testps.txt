 Abhigyan Shakuntalam's name is at the top
 abhigyaan shaakuntalan main bhi uskaa chaturth ank or is ank main bhi chauthaa shloke to bahut hi romantic he
 In Abhigyan Shakuntal, there is a considerable amount of poetry as well as a portion of poetry
 isamen shringaar mukhya ras he; or uske sanyog tathaa viyog donon hi pakshon kaa paripaak sundar rup main hua he
 Apart from this, there is good expression of humor, valor and Karun Ras
 sthaan-sthaan par sundar or manoharini utprekshaayen na keval pathak ko chamatkrit kar detii hai, kintu abhisht bhav kii tivrata ko badhaane main hi sahaayak hoti hai
 In all the plays, Kalidas did not use his similes and motivations for mere ornamentation
 prayek sthaan par unki upama yaa utpreksha arth kii abhivyakti ko raspurn banane main sahaayak hui he
 Kalidas is famous in Sanskrit literature for his similes
 shaakuntal main bhi unki upyukt upama chunane kii shakti bhalee-bhaanti prakat hui
 In one place about Shakuntala, King Dushyant says that 'it is a flower that no one has smelled; Such is the Navapallava, which does not scratch anyone's fingernails; There is a gem, which is not pierced and there is a honey, which no one has tasted
 ’ in upamaaon ke dwaara shakuntala ke saundarya kii ek anokhi jhalak hamaari ankhon ke saamne aa jaati he
 Similarly, in the fifth issue Dushyanta abandons Shakuntala, saying, "O Tapaswini, do you want to tarnish your clan and impure me, like a river that breaks the coast and falls down the tree of the shore and It also taps its water
 ’ yahaan shakuntala kii chat ko todakar bahane vaali nadi se di gai upama raja ke manobhaav ko vyakt karne main vishesh rup se sahaayak hoti he
 Similarly, when Kanva's disciples take Shakuntala and reach Dushyant, Dushyant's vision falls on the Shakuntala among those ascetics
 vahaan shakuntala ke saundarya kaa vistrut varnan na karke kavi ne unke mukh se keval itnaa kahalava diya he ki ‘in tapasviyon ke bich main vah ghunghat vaali sundari koun he, jo pile patton ke bich main nai konpal ke samaan dikhaai pad rahi he
 'this small upma has depicted the beauty of Shakuntala by the goodness of the yellow leaves and the buds
 isi prakaar sarvadman ko dekhakar dushyant kehete hai ki ‘yah pratapi balak us agni ke sphuling kii bhaanti prathit hota he, jo dadhakati aag banane ke liye idhan kii raah dekhtaa he
 With this upma, Kalidas not only revealed the brilliance of the child, but has also clearly conveyed that this child will grow up to become the glorious Chakravarti emperor
 is prakaar kii manohar upamaaon ke anek udhaaharan shaakuntal main se diye ja sakate hai kyonki shaakuntal main 180 upamaayen prayukt huin hai
 And all of them surpass one by one
 yah thik he upama ke chunaav main kalidas ko vishesh kushalta praapt thi or yah bhi thik he ki unki-si sundar upmaayen anya kaviyon kii rachanaaon main durlabh hai, phir bhi kalidas kii sabase badi visheshta upama-kaushal nahin he
 Upma-kaushal is a common part of his poetry skills
 apane manobhaav ko vyakt karne athwa kisi ras kaa paripaak karne athwa kisi bhav kii teevr anubhuti ko jagaane kii kalidas anek vidhiyaan jaanate hai
 Kalidas has made his style particularly delightful by using a contextual selection of words, choosing the appropriate verses of the desired sense and using euphemism
 jahaan kalidas shakuntala ke soundarya-varnan par utre hai, vahaan unhone keval upamaaon or utprekshaon dwaara shakuntala kaa rup chithran karke hi santosh nahin kar liya he
 At first, he merely said that 'if there is so much form among the residents of Tapovan, then understand that the forest vines beat the vines of the garden
 ’ phir dushyant ke mukh se unhone kahalwaya ki ‘itani sundar kanya ko ashram ke niyam-paalan main lagaana aisa hi he jaise nil camel kii pankhuri se babul kaa ped kaatna
 'after that, Kalidas says that' Shakuntala's form is so beautiful that even though she is wearing a thick vulcanic cloth, then her beauty is not reduced to anything, but it has increased
 kyonki sundar vyakti ko jo bhi kuch pahana diya jaae vahi uskaa aabhushan ho jaataa he
 'he then compares Sukumar's body of King Shakuntala with the green flower-laden Lata, so that the image of that unique beauty is painted in front of the reader's eyes
 iske baad us saundarya kii anubhuti ko charam seemaa par pahunchane ke liye kalidas ek bhramar ko le aae hai; jo shakuntala ke mukh ko ek sundar khilaa hua phool samajhakar uskaa rasapan karne ke liye uske upar mandaraane lagata he
 Thus, Kalidasa did not take the support of the antlers to portray the beauty of Shakuntala as much as the euphemism; And this cuisine is considered to be the life of poetry

 After partition of India, Pakistan needed a capital city
 naa to lahore or na hi karachi jaise nagar is hetu sahi paae gaye antah ek nae nagar kii sthapana kaa nirnay liya gaya jo puri tarah se niojit ho

 Every GV, who comes to take mother-in-law, feels something or the other
 yah khaali maanvo ke liye nahi balki har ek jivi ko hota hai
 We know this feeling in English by the name Emotional
 imotional lewel ek jeev se duusare jeev main bhinn prakaar se dekha jaataa he
 In this way, we can estimate this emotional level or balance through fluxology and can play it very well
 ham kabhi bhi kisi duusare insaan ke imoshan kaa apmaan nahin karnaa chahie
 We feel something all the time
 ise ham bhaavana bhi kehete hai
 That feeling keeps changing according to time, other people and their mind
 ham hamaare chehre ke dwaara is bhaavana ko vyakt karte rahete hai
 Those feelings keep appearing in our eyes
 par agar insaan chaahe to vah is bhaavana ko dasre ko dikhane se roak saktaa he
 For this, a little liquidity is required
 par zyada se zyada log in bhaawanaaon ko roak nahin sakate or chaahe yaa na chaahate hue bhi dusron ko apni in bhaawanaaon ko dikhaa dete hai
 Human beings spread feelings to each other about the matter
 unki bhashaa style, sharir k upyog, aakhon kaa chalan or unke bolne ke tareekon se ham unki man kii baat ko vichaar kar sakate hai
 This does not mean that whatever we come to mind, we can think about other human beings, but through this we can clearly guess what is the deception in the mind of another human being or life
 ham maanav jivi ek duusare ke aakhon or chaharon ko dekhakar dusron kii mood ko jaan sakate hai
 After this, we talk to the person later
 agar vah adami yaa aurath khushi se phulre he toh ham bhi us khushi main bhaag lete he or agar vah adami yaa aurath dukhih he toh hum unke mood ko thik karne kii koshish main lag jate hai
 In this way, one can understand others on the strength of the beliefs of a populace
 isi tarah manvon main bahut tarah kaa bhavnaae hote hai
 Like Shrungar {where one crosses each other}, Rodhra {showing anger}, Hasya {laughing face}, Bebts {disrespect}, Veer {valor}, terrible {fear knowing}, adabut {stunned corner}, Karuna { To have mercy}, Sahaja {sama Bhavana} This is the new rasa written in our shasthas
 jo bhi ham chaharon main dikhaate he voh sab bhavanaae in nav bhaawanaaon main se ek hai
 In this way, one human differs from another human through these expressions
 maanvon kaa thik he, par unka kya jo baat nahin kar sakate he? ek praani oe maanav ke bich? do jaanwaron ke bich?hum is prashn ko bhi dur kar sakate hai
 It is not necessary that we communicate emotion to each other through talk
 aakhe hi kaaphi he
 So that we can recognize each other
 isi prakar ek kutta or ek maanav ke bich bolne kii jakoi zarurat nahin nota he
 But everything is revealed with the help of eyes
 yah baat khali kuton ko nahin balki ped, paudon or duusare janwaron ko bhi ham daal sakate hai
 In this way, we will always understand each other more, do good to each other and try to live together
 isi prakaar hame ek dusre kii bhaawanaaon ko samaj kar chalanaa chahie
 By giving importance to their feelings of not misunderstanding others, if we keep everyone's feelings the same then our lives become easier
 ek duusare ko zyada achche se samaj bhi sakate he or prakrti, pashu or maanav ke bich bhi ek acha rishta bana rahegaa

 Organic farming is a method of agriculture that is based on the use or minimal use of synthesized fertilizers and synthesized pesticides and uses crop rotation, green manure, compost, etc
 to maintain the fertility of the soil
 san 1990 ke baad se vishwa main jaivik utpaadon kaa bazaar kaafii badha he
 Increasing population all over the world is a serious problem, with increasing population, the use of various types of chemical fertilizers, poisonous pesticides to get maximum production in the food production competition by humans affected the ecosystem
 Due to which, the fertility of the land is disturbed, at the same time the environment gets polluted and the human health falls The sentence comes
 pracheen kaal main maanav swasthya ke anukul tathaa prakritik vaataavaran ke anuroop kheti kii jaati thi, jisase jaivik or ajaivik padaarthon ke bich aadan-pradaan kaa chakra nirantar chalata rahaa tha, jiske falswaroop jal, bhoomi, vaayu tathaa vaataavaran pradooshit nahin hota tha
 In India, cow farming was practiced along with agriculture since time immemorial, the proof of which is Lord Krishna and Balarama in our texts, which we address as Gopal and Haldhar i
e
 Agriculture and Gopalan was jointly extremely beneficial
 The creature was very useful only for the environment
 parantu badalte parivesh main gopaalan dhire-dhire kam ho gaya tathaa krishi main tarah-tarah kii rasaynic khaadon va kitnashkon kaa prayog ho rahaa he jiske falswaroop jaivik or ajaivik padaartho ke chakra kaa santulan bigadataa ja rahaa he or vaataavaran pradooshit hokar, maanav jati ke swasthya ko prabhavit kar rahaa he
 Now instead of using chemical fertilizers, poisonous pesticides, we can get maximum production by using organic fertilizers and medicines, which will keep the land, water and environment pure and humans and every living organism will be healthy
 bharat varsh main gramin arthvyavastha kaa mukhya aadhaar krishi he or krishakon kii mukhya aay kaa saadhan kheti he
 In view of the increasing population since the time of the Green Revolution, it is necessary to increase production from the point of view of income, for more production, more amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used in farming, due to which the marginal and small farmers have high cost in low holdings
 Looks and water, land, air and environment are also being polluted as well as food items are also becoming poisonous
 isliye is prakaar kii uparokt sabhi samasyaon se nipatane ke liye gat varshon se nirantar tikaoo kheti ke siddhanth par kheti karne kii sifarish kii gai, jise pradesh ke krishi vibhaag ne is vishesh prakaar kii kheti ko apnaane ke liye, badhaava diya jise ham jaivik kheti ke naam se jaanate he
 Government of India is also promoting to adopt this farming
 m
pra
 main sarvapratham 2001-02 main jaivik kheti kaa andolan chalaakar prayek jile ke prayek vikaas khand ke ek gaanv main jaivik kheti prarambh ki gai or in gaanvon ko jaivik gaanv kaa naam diya gaya
 In this way, organic farming started in 313 villages in the first year
 iske baad 2002-03 main divatiya varsh main prayek jile ke prayek vikaskhand ke do-do gaanv, varsh 2003-04 main 2-2 gaanv arthath 1565 graamon main jaivik kheti kii gai
 Again in the year 2006-07, 5-5 villages were selected in each development block
 is prakaar pradesh ke 3130 graamon jaivik kheti kaa kaarykram liya ja rahaa he
 In May 2002, a seminar on organic farming was organized in Bhopal under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture at the national level, which was attended by national experts and experienced farmers of organic farming, which encouraged the adoption of organic farming
 pradesh ke prayek jile main jaivik kheti ke prachaar-prasar hetu chalit jhaanki, posters, banners, sahitya, ekal naatak, kathputli pradshan jaivik haat evam visheshgyon dwaara jaivik kheti par udbodhan aadi ke madhyam se prachaar-prasar kiya jaakar krishakon main jan jagrati failaai ja rahi he
 Human health is very closely related to organic farming
 is paddati se kheti karne main sharir tulanaatmak rupase adhik swasthya rahata he
 The average age also increases
 hamaare aane baale peedi bhi adhik swasthya rahenge
 The use of pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture would have poisoned the crop
 jaivik kheti se fasal swasthya or jaldi kharab nahin hota he
 The method of organic farming gives equal or more production than the method of chemical farming, that is, organic farming is absolutely helpful in increasing soil fertility and productivity of farmers
 varsha aadhaarit kshetron main jaivik kheti kii vidhi or bhi adhik laabhadaayak he
 By doing organic farming, the cost of production is not only low, but also the farmers brothers get more income and organic products are more competitive in the international market
 jiske falswaroop saamaanya utpaadan kii apeksha main krishak bhai adhik laabh praapt kar sakate hai
 In modern times, the path of organic farming is very beneficial for increasing population, environmental pollution, conservation of fertile land and human health
 maanav jivan ke sarvangin vikaas ke liye nitant aavashyak he ki prakritik sansaadhan pradooshit na hon, shuddh vaataavaran rahe evam paushitak aahaar miltaa rahe, iske liye hamen jaivik kheti kii krishi paddatiyaan ko apnaanaa hoga joki hamaare naiysargik sansadhano evam maanviya paryaavaran ko pradooshit kiye bagaiyr samast janamanas ko khaadya saamagree uplabdh kara sakegi tathaa hamen khushhaal jeene kii raah dikhaa sakegi

 is prakaar jab shani grah lagn se barahavin raashi main pravesh karata he to us vishesh raashi se agali do raashi main guzarate hue apana samay chakra puraa karata he
 Due to the slow motion of Saturn, this planet travels in one zodiac for about two and a half years, thus affecting three times, ie seven and a half years duration of seven and a half years, while effecting one previous one and one next planet

 In this process, there is a distance of one degree on both sides of the moon

 In astronomy, Mahanova refers to the terrible explosion of a star
 mahanova nova se adhik bada dhamaakaa hota he or is se nikalataa prakaash or vikiran itnaa zordaar hota he ke kuch samay ke liye apane aage puri akashganga ko bhi dhundhala kar detaa he lekin phir dhire-dhire khud dhundhala jaataa he
 As long as Mahanova is at its peak, it can sometimes transmit as much energy in a few weeks or months as our sun would do in its billions of years of life
 mahanova ke dhamaake main sitara apane adhikansh bhaag ko 30,000 kimi prati sekkind tak kii raftaar se vyom main phenkata he, jo antartaarkeey madhyam main ek akramak jatke kii tarang ban ke failati he
 As a result, the spreading gas and a cloud of celestial dust are called "mahanova remnants"
 "mahanova" ko angrezi main "supernova" likhaa jaataa he
 In 1604, the scientist John Kepler saw a Mahanova, which was later renamed "sasan 1604"
 isse pehle taco brahe ne san 1572 ek mahanova dekha jise es° en° 1572 kehete he
 He called it "de Stella Nova" in Latin in his book, which means "about the new star", which led to the name "nova", although it meant only "nova" or "new" in Latin
 1930 tak bade visphoton ko "mahanova" or chote visphoton ko "nova" bulaayaa jaataa tha, lekin kabhi-kabhi ek hi chiz ke liye donon naam prayog kar liye jate the

 pohari vidhansabha nirvachan kshetra, 230 vidhansabha, kaa ek nirvachan kshetra he
 It comes in Shivpuri district
 pohari Vachspatiyam is the modern dictionary of Sanskrit
 iskaa sankalan tarkvachspati taranath bhattacharya ne kiya tha jo bengal ke rajkeey sanskrit mahavidhyalay main adhyaaapak the
 Its construction started in 1866 AD and ended in 1884 AD
 is prakaar isko puraa karne main 18 varsh lage
 It is a larger version of the Sanskrit dictionary than Shabdakalpadrum
 ech woodro ne apni 'vachanika' main is kosh kii visheshta bataate hue kaha ki "wilson" kii 'sanskrit dictionari' or 'shabdakalpadrum' kii apeksha iskaa kshetra vistrut or gambhiratar he
 Also, how many such words of tantra, philosophy, verses and theology are not in sanskrit-german-dictionary of 'roth Bothalingk'
 isamen yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki 'shabdakalpadrum' kaa pratham sanskaran bangla lipi main hua tha
 There are hundreds of thousands of words unavailable in the available dictionaries at that time
 saamaanya vaidic shabd to hai hi, saath hi aise bhi anek vaidic shabd he jo tatkaaleen shabdkoshon main aprapya hai
 Apart from conspiracies, it also includes the terminology of the less popular philosophies such as Charvaka, Madhyamika, Yogachara, Vaibhashika, Sautratrik, Arhat, Ramanuja, Madhva, Pashupat, Shaiva, Pratibhigya, Raseshwar
 puraanon or uppuraanon se sangruhit puraatan raajaaon kaa itihaas tathaa pratnayugin bhartiya bhugol kaa bhi isamen nirdesh hua he
 The technical terms and other descriptions of medicine have also been detailed
 ganit jyotish or falit jyotish ke paribhaashik shabd bhi hai
 Although the compilation of Vedic words has been attributed by Kaushakaar to the special importance of this dictionary, many Vedic words have also been omitted and the etymology and meaning of the majority of Vedic words are also self-evident
 'rathabothalingk' ke brihatsanskrit' shabdkosh ke upyog kaa bhi kaaphi praytn kiya gaya hai
 In short, we can say that by the creation of 'vachspatyam', such an enlarged and relatively larger version of the aforesaid 'shabdakalpadrum' came out, which in most respects from the point of view of composition, seeks to broaden and complete the dimension of 'vardakalpadrum'
 
 'tarkvachspati' ne nishchay hi jitna parishram kiya vah asaamaanya he
 His serious knowledge, talismanic manisha and wide-ranging virtue show astonishing amazement in it
 'shabdakalpadrum' kii adharpithika paakar bhi granthkaar ne koshkala ko 'shabdakalpadrum' kii style main kaaphi vyapak banaaya
 There is another feature targeted at it, rather than ‘shabdakalpadrum’
 'shabdakalpadram' main 'pad' subant tiqat die gaye hai
 The form of Prathama Ekabachan has been given the place of the word Vyakhyayya in the dictionary
 panratu 'vachaspatyam' main die gay shabd 'pad' na hokar 'pratipadik' athwa 'dhaaturup' main upanyast hai
 By the way, from the general point of view - from the idea of the method of creation - can be called the developed form of the word 'kalakpadrum' of 'vachspatiyam'
 'wilson' or 'monier williamy' ke koshon dbaara arthbodh, shabdarthgyan evam shabdaprayog kii soochna tathaa vyakhya-parak parichay sankshipt he, par upyogi rup main karaayaa gaya he
 But the semantics that emerged from the expansive background of citations by 'shabdakalpadrum' and 'vachaspatyam', although helpful in providing syntheses, have become encyclopedic through citations
 upyogitasapann hokar bhi saamaanya sanskritgyon ke liye— yah vyavaharik sauvidhya se rahit ho gaya he

 uttari yakuut shikaar, machhlee pakadaney or rangifer-paalan se jeevani chalate hai, jabaki dakshini yakuut gaay or ghodon kaa maveshi-paalan karte hai

 The reasons for which the equilibrium, or health, of various parts of the body are destroyed and distortions occur in them, are called causative and their science is called etiology
 ye kaaran anek hai
 They are divided into the following parts: ye hetukikaarak jis prakaar se vikrutiyon ko utpann karte hai, usko rogajanan kehete hai
 The pathologies that occur in different parts of the body due to pathological causes are known as pathologies and the description of the metal organ or intent with these deformities is called the deformed body and the pathology of these deformities is pathology or pathology
 vikrutivigyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy vividh rogakaarakon se vibhinn ango main jo vividh vikrutiyaan utpann hoti he, unka kaaryakaaran bhav pradarshit karnaa he
 The main purpose of pathology is to give an explanation of the gross and subtle forms of those deformities and to clarify the symptoms arising from various diseases based on them
 yah uddeshy vividh vyaadhiyon se mrit vyaktiyon ke sampurna itihaas ke saath, maranottar pareekshan se unke sharir ke vibhinn dhatvashayadi angon ke bheetar paae janevaali vikrutiyon, kaa mail kiye bina siddh nahin ho saktaa
 Post mortem for pathology was introduced in Western countries in the 16th - 17th centuries
 morgagni ne san 1761 main uske purv kiye gaye saikadon shavpareekshanon kii chaanvin kar, unamem se saat sau shavpareekshanon ke vrittant ko brihad sangrah granth ke teen bhaagon main prakashit kiya
 In this treatise, the extent to which the signs and symptoms found in various organs of patients correlate with the anatomical malformations found within their bodies
 iske pashchaat hi vikrutivigyaan ko swatantra astitv praapt hua
 Rudolph Fikhons began using the microscope in the 19th century to test for physiologic malformations and published his treatise on cellular pathology in 1846 AD
 is granth ne rogon ke swaroop kii tathaa unke abhyas ke liye koun-cone se saadhan prayukt hone chahie or prayukt ho sakate hai, inke sambandh kii kalpana main kranti paidaa kii tathaa vikruti vigyaan ko, jo pehle roganidan ke antargat ek chota sa vishay tha, nidaan kaa ek uttam adhishthan bana diya
 Despite the latent malformations in the body parts, the reaction, swelling, renovation, growth inhibition, degeneration, tumor, etc
 are some common types of Ini-guinea
 sharir ke bheetar in vikrutiyon kaa swaroop jab aasaani se indriya grahya hota he, tab usko sthool vikruti kehete hai tathaa sookshm swaroop kii vikruti hone par in vikrutiyon ko dekhne ke liye jab sookshmdarshi yantra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he tab usko sookshm vikruti kehete hai
 Deformations emphasize the heterogeneity of various body parts and their anatomical and morphological changes and their functional changes in diseases
 saransh main vikrutiyon kaa ullekh vibhinn angon se sambandhit hota he or rog kaa ullekh adhiktar lakshanon se sambandhit hota he
 The disease remains in the form of malformations in the body from long ago
 keval vah bahut sookshm hone se indriyagrahya kam hokar buddhigrahya adhik hota he
 When complete body deformities and their causes are described according to the above general types, then it is called normal pathology and when each organ, intention or institution of the body is described independently of the above types of deformities
 Is, then it is called special pathology
 prayogshaala ke andar vibhinn parikshaon se rogi ke rog kaa adhyayan clinical pathology dwaara kiya jaataa he
 General pathology is divided into the following chapters
 aadhunik vichaarak yah maanate hai ki sujan, sajiv sharirastha koshikaon ke dwaara kisi bhi kshobh ke virodh main kii gai pratikriya maatr he
 There are four reasons for the outbreak: sujan ke pramukh chihn nimnlikhit hai : Along with this, there is a loss of activity of the organ due to some shock in the tissues and due to some colic
 sharir kaa nirmaan karanevaale vibhinn utakon ke ke hraas, vinaash tathaa kshati ko saamaanya oothkakshay kehete hai
 Causes - The following are the major causes of tissue tissue saransh main oothkakshay kaa mukhya kaaran dhamni, shiraaon tathaa keshikaon main avrodh kaa hona he
 Due to this, nutritious substance does not reach the said place
 oothkakshay ke prakaar nimnlikhit hai : It is also a tissue-specific action
 jab kisi utak kaa apakarshan kaha jaataa he, to iskaa abhipraay utak main ek vishesh prakaar kaa parivartan samajhnaa chahie, jaise vasa apakarshan kehane se kisi ootkavishesh main vasa kii upasthiti he, aisa bodh hota he, usee ke anusaar namakaran bhi hota he, jaise hriday apakarshan, mansapeshiy apakarshan, yakruti apakarshan ityadi
 In other words, when there is a change in the chemical activity of the cell due to lack of nutritious diet of tissues, it is called detraction
 isamen koshika kii purnataya mrityu ho jaati he tathaa uske protoplasm se ek nae prakaar ke rasinic padaarth kii utpatti hoti hai
 This substance is completely different from the previous structure of the cell and thus the function of the cell is completely different
 jab koshika ke andar lasika main se ek vishisht padaarth nikalakar ikattha ho jaataa he, to use ant:spandan kehete hai
 This infusion is mainly adipose, calcareous and amyloid type, whereas ablation is fatty mucoid and colloid
 rakt ke abhaav se jab utak main ek prakaar kii sadan hone lagati hai, to use koth kehete hai
 It is of two types dry koth and humid
 shushk koth - jab kisi ek bhaag kii dhamni dwaara kisi ang main rakt pahunchnaa band ho jaataa he, to shushk koth kii utpatti hoti he
 Humid dictionary - In this, the movement of blood from the veins by a particular organ towards the heart stops completely
 rakt kii us sthaan par aamad hoti he, parantu nikaas nahin hota
 Apart from the above two types of coaths, there are other types of coaths as well, such as intercostal coath, infectious coath, pneumothritis, diabetes mellitus, senescent coath, and renal disease
 jeern yaa vinasht hue utak yaa koshikaon kii kriya yathasambhav pun: praapt kii jaae, is abhipraay se jo unka punarjanan hota he, vah punarnirmaan, yaa jirnoddhar kaha jaataa he
 It is such a special state of the body in which there is growth of body tissue
 saamanyat: arbud do prakaar ke hote hai : Soft tumors - These are fatal because they do not cause any harm to life
 ghaatak arbud- jin arbudon main vighatan atyadhik hota he, unamem utak kii si akruti nahin banati
 Their composition is different from that of tissue and their growth is very rapid
 ve sharir main shighratapurvak prasaarit hokar andar hi andar swasth avyavon ko aakraant karte hai
 The action of this internal transmission is called metastasis
 is kaaran ye bahut maarak bhi hote hai or isi se inhen ghaatak, dusht, yaa chand arbud kaha jaataa he
 When there is an attack of any pathogenic bacteria in the human body, then the nature inside the body resists them the most, and in this war, the body's thick cells protect the body from disease by destroying the force of those external bacteria
 sharir ke andar se utpann isi roganashak shakti ko pratiraksha kehete hai
 There are two types of immunity: swaabhaavik pratiraksha - kisi rog ke pratirodh main sharir ke andar jo swaabhaavik shakti utpann hoti he use swaabhaavik pratiraksha kehete hai
 Earned immunity - If a person does not have the resistance to a particular disease and retrospectively by himself or by any other measures, he can be called acquired immunity
 udaahranarth, haija, chechak, motitora, titains ityadi paidaa karanevaale kuch rogaanu aise chote hai jo ek baar sharir main pravesh karne par rog paidaa kar sakate hai, parantu thodi maatra main pravisht karne par rog ke prati pratiraksha shakti utpann karte hai
 The reason for this is that a toxin produces disease in the body due to excessive intake, but the same toxin creates immunity by staying in very small amounts
 bhainswada-gurad0-2, satpuli tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke paudi jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Those controversial and negotiable matters relating to a suit or civil suit in the legal field are called debates or debaters which are said to be claims from the first party, but which the other party denies
 nyaayalay aisi hi baton ke satyasty kaa vichaar karke unke aadhaar par mukademe kaa nirnay karata he
 It is of two types - kande, berinag tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke pithoragarh jile kaa ek gaanv he
 a meaningful change of what is said or written in one language in another language is called translation
 anuwaad kaa kaary bahut puraane samay se hota aayaa he
 In Sanskrit, the word 'translation' has been used in many contexts such as repetition, re-statement, statement used for support, frequency by the disciple
 sanskrit ke ’vad‘ dhaatu se ’anuwaad‘ shabd kaa nirmaan hua he
 'vad' means to speak
 ’vad‘ dhaatu main 'a' pratyay jod dene par bhavvaachak sangya main iskaa parivartit rup he 'vaad' jiskaa arth he- 'kehane kii kriya' yaa 'kahi hui baat'
 The word 'translation' is formed by adding the prefix 'anu' to 'ism', which means to say the received statement again
 iskaa prayog pehali baar monier williams ne angreji shabd tansleshan ke paryaay ke rup main kiya
 Only then, the word 'translation' was used to refer to the re-presentation of material presented by someone in one language into another
 vastav main anuwaad bhashaa ke indradhanushi rup kii pahchaan kaa samarthatam maarg he
 The imperative of translation cannot be avoided by making noise of the prosperity of a language and neither can it be denied the multicolon utility of translation
 jt
 Six jpvch ke paryyswaroop ’anuwaad‘ shabd kaa sweekrut arth he, ek bhashaa kii vichaar saamagree ko duusari bhashaa main pahunchnaa
 There is also a practice of 'ultha' in Hindi for translation
 angreji main TRANSLATION ke saath hi TRANSCRIPTION kaa prachlan bhi he, jise hindi main 'lipyantaran' kaha jaataa he
 The difference between translation and transliteration is clear from this example - isse spasht he ki 'anuwaad' main hindi vaakya ko angreji main prastut kiya gaya he jabaki lipyantaran main nagari lipi main likhi gayi baat ko maatr roman lipi main rakh diya gaya he
 'bhashaparan' and 'metamorphosis' have also been used for translation
 lekin ab in donon hi shabdon ke nae arth or upyog prachlit hai
 The use of 'bilingual' and 'metamorphosis' is synonymous with the term INTERPRETATION in English, which means establishing linguistic contact between two people
 kannadabhashi vyakti or asamiyabhaashi vyakti ke bich kii bhashik duuri ko bhashaantaran ke dwaara hi dur kiya jaataa he
 These days, the term 'metamorphosis' is often used to represent the creation of one genre in another genre
 jais, premachand ke upanyaas 'godaan' kaa roopantaran 'hori' naatak ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Translation is the submission of ideas expressed in one language in another language
 is vishesh arth main hi 'anuwaad' shabd kaa abhipraay sunishchit he
 The language from which translation is done is the native language or source language
 usase jis nai bhashaa main anuwaad karnaa he, vah 'prastut bhashaa' yaa 'lakshya bhashaa' he
 In this way, translation is the translation of the sentiment or idea presented in the source language into the target language without any change
 ja a good translator is one who- anuwaad asaadhaaran rup se kathin or ahvaahanaatmak kaary mana jaataa he
 It is a complex, artificial, need-generating, and visually creative process that requires extraordinary and exceptional talent
 yah isaki apni prakruti he
 But it is believed that due to lack of original writing, translation does not get a place of honor
 kyonki is baat kii avganana hoti he ki anuwaad isiilie kathin he ki vah moulik lekhan nahin-pehle kahi gai baat ko hi dubaara kahana hota he, jisamen anek niyantranon or bandhanon kaa paalan karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Thus, the importance of translation was reduced due to being non-formal, but for this reason the controls and restrictions required for it were not considered important
 is sambandh main srujansheel lekhakon ke vichaaron kii praayah charchaa hoti rahi he
 Some ideas are as follows: sampoorn anuwaad kaary keval ek asamadhey samasya kaa samaadhaan khojane ke liye kiya gaya prayaas maatr he
 The translation of a work increases its faults and squares its virtues
 kala kii ek vidha ke rup main anuwaad kabhi safal nahin ho sakate
 Translators are deceptive
 aise vichaaron ke udbhav ke peeche tatkaaleen paristhitiyaan tathaa unase prerit dharanaayen maani jaati hai
 Earlier, most of the translation material were literary works, whose translation could not meet the expectations of the reader due to limitations of the literary nature of the works
 saath hi yah bhi dharna thi ki rachana kii bhashaa ke prayek ansh kaa anuwaad apekshit he, jisase mul samvednaa kaa koi ansh chat na paae, or kyonki yah sambhav nahin, atah anuwaad ko pravanchana kii koti main rakh diya gaya tha
 This situation largely lasted until the first half of the nineteenth century in which translation was more driven primarily by personal interest, less driven by social need
 iske atirikt moulik lekhan kii parimangat prachurtaa ke kaaran bhi is prakaar kii raay bani
 After the split of imperialism after the second world war, many small and big nations became independent and the question of their identity became important
 sangheey ganraajyon ke ghatak bhi apni asmita ke vishay main sachet hone lage
 In this state of contact-establishment and identity-development, the language has a central place, which appears as a state of multilingualism
 isamen anuwaad kii satta avashyambhavi he
 As a result, translation has primarily become a social necessity
 vividh prakaar ke lekhanon ke anuwaad hone lage
 Translation work became a business
 anuvaadakon ko prashikshit karne ke abhikaran sthapit ho gaye, jinamein alpakaaleen or purnsatreey paathyakramon or kaaryshaalaaon aadi kaa aayojan kiya jane laga
 It also resulted in the change of social attitude towards translation on the one hand and on the other hand, the development of translation theory from the cognitive point of view received special emphasis and the need for translation theory was accepted for translation training courses
 falswaroop, anuwaad siddhanth ek apekshaakrit swatantra gyaanshakha ban gaya, jisaki jaankaree anuvadak, anuwaad shikshak, or anuwaad sameekshak, teenon ke liye upadey hua
 Theoretical discussion about translation originated in the modern era itself, understanding it as being contrary to both fact and logic
 anuwaad kaary kii lambi parampara ko dekhte hue yah maananaa tarksangat ban gaya ki anuwaad kaary ke vishay main saiddhanthik charchaa kii parampara bhi puraani he
 In the writings of Cicero in the first century BCE, the seeds of translation thinking are received and thereafter scholars have been expressing their views on this subject
 is chintan kii prishthbhumi bhi avashya rahi he, yadhyapi use spasht rup se paribhaashit nahin kiya gaya
 It is definitely believed that just as the translation work is organized in modern form, the development of relatively well-defined background of translation theory is also due to modern era
 anuwaad siddhanth ke aadhunik sandarbh kii mul visheshta he isaki bahupaksheeyata
 It is not based on an integrated background, but based on the coordinated background of many but interrelated scriptures, whose background is made up of relevant parts
 mukhya shaastra hai - paath sanket vigyaan, sampreshan siddhanth, bhashaa prayog siddhanth, or tulanaatmak anuprayukt bhashavigyaan
 It is also pertinent to clarify that due to the practical importance of human translation and mechanical translation on the one hand, and written translation and oral translation on the other, the thinking about their theoretical side has started
 tathaapi maanavkrut likhit madhyam ke anuwaad kii hi parimangat tathaa gunatmak pradhanta maani jaati rahi he tathaa inase sambandhit saiddhanthik chintan ke mudde vishesh rup se praasangik hai
 Although the tradition of translation thought in ancient Indian tradition is not as organized and as written, as in the West, however, the seeds of translation thought are available
 tadnusaar, anuwaad punarukti he - ek bhashaa main vyanjit sandesh ko duusari bhashaa main punah kahana
 This approach towards translation seems to be different from the accepted notion in the western tradition
 parantu is drushti ko apnaane se anuwaad sambandhi anek saiddhanthik binduon kii adhik vishad tathaa sangat vyakhya kii gai he
 In this regard, the second point of view is dialectics
 jo aadhunik he tathaa mukhya rup se sanrachnawad kii dein he
 It is clear from looking at the tradition of translation work that the thinking of the theory of Anavad has become more about literary works
 yah sthiti sangat bhi he
 In the past era, only literary works were selected for translation
 ab bhi saahitiyik kritiyon ke hi anuwaad adhik pariman main hote hai
 However, translation of non-literary writings has also started to occur in greater quantity due to the request of circumstances
 vishesh baat yah he ki donon kotiyon ke lekhanon main ek moolbhoot antar he
 Which can be expressed more clearly in the terminology of subjectivity and individualism of the writer
 vyaktinishth lekhan kaa, apni prakruti kii visheshta se, kuch apana hi sandarbh he
 Having said this, we are not denying the common background of both, but in the context presented, we want to specifically highlight the distance and relative autonomy of both
 yah uchit hi he ki bhashaprayog ke paksh se nirvaiyaktik lekhan ke anuwaad ke saiddhanthik sandarbh ko bhi vishesh rup se ubhaara jaae
 An evolutionary dimension of translation theory is the tendency to research
 anuwaad siddhanth kii bahuvidyaparak prakruti ke kaaran vibhinn kshetron ke visheshgy-bhashavigyaani, samajashastri, manovigyaani, shikshavid, nritatvvigyaani, soochna siddhanth visheshgy-paraspar sahyog ke saath anuwaad ke saiddhanthik ansho par shodhakarya main ruchi lene lage
 The field of translation work increased
 alag-alag samskritiyon ke logon main sampark badha - log videshon main shiksha ke liye jate, vyapaarik-audyogic sanghathan vibhinn deshon main kaam karte, vibhinn bhashaa bhashi log sammelnon main ek saath baithkar vimarsh karte, rashtron ke madhya rajanyik anubandh hone lage
 In all these there was an urgent need for translation and specific problems of translation began to emerge
 in samasyaon kaa adhyayan anuwaad sambandhi anusandhan kaa urvar kshetra bana
 On the one hand, new thinking emerged on the basis of the evidence presented by translation on the relation between language and culture on the one hand and language and thought on the other
 mashin anuwaad tathaa maukhik anuwaad ke kshetron main nai-nai sambhaavnaayen saamne aane lagi, jisane in kshetron main anuwaad anusandhan ko gati pradaan kii
 The new areas of language study also inspired the experts to think innovatively on the traditional fields of human translation and written translation
 in sab pravritiyon se anawaad siddhanth ko pratishtha kaa pad milane laga or ise saiddhanthik shodh ke ek upyukt kshetra ke rup main sweekruti praapt hone lagi
 The first meaningful attempt at translation was made by HH Wilson in 1855 through the 'glory of Judicial and Revenue Terms'
 san 1961 main rajbhasha vidhaayi ayog kii sthapana hui
 Its task was to prepare an All India Standard Law Terminology
 1970 main vidhi shabdaawalee kaa prakaashan hua
 It is growing
 iskaa naveen sanskaran 1984 main niklaa
 This commission has translated many texts related to law
 kai nyaayalayon main nyaayadhish hindi main bhi nirnay dene lage he
 The tradition of translation is very old
 bebal ke minar kii katha prasiddh hi he, jo is tathy kii ore sanket karti he ki, maanav samaaj main anek bhashaayen boli jaati hai
 It can be logically inferred that translation behavior may have originated much earlier due to the social imperative of mutual contact
 parantu jahaan tak likhit pramaanon kaa sambandh he, At a larger level, translation happens only if the two different linguistic communities maintain long-term contacts and as part of an effort to balance them, people from under-developed cultures enrich their literature by translating the literature of well-developed people
 greek se latin main or arabi se europea bhashaaon main prachar anuwaad isi pravriti ke parinaam maane jate hai
 The translation work is divided into two parts - ancient and modern in terms of trends in history
 pracheen yug main mukhyatah teen prakaar kii rachnaaon ke anuwaad praapt hote hai
 Because in these three areas, books were often composed
 wein kshetra hai - sahitya, darshan or dharm
 Among the literary works, Iliad and Odesi in Greek, Ramayana in Sanskrit and Mahabharata are such texts which were widely translated
 darshanik rachanaaon main plato ke samvaad, anuwaad kii drushti se lokapriy hue
 Most translations of the Bible are found in religious writings
 aadhunik yug main anuwaad ke madhyam se pracheen yug ke ye mahaan granth ab vibhinn bhashaa bhashiyon ko uplabdh hone lage hai
 The specialty of these translations in terms of translation technique is that, in the ancient era, these translations were exclusively unilateral, ie the language in which the translations were made did not translate any of their works into the original text
 iskaa kaaran yah ki mul granthon kii tulana main lakshyabhasha ke granth praayah utane utkrisht nahin hote the, duusari baat yah ki mul grathon kii bhashaa ke prati atyant aadar bhaavana ke kaaran lakshya bhashaa ke rup main prayog main laana sambhavtah anuchit samajha jaataa tha
 The field of translation has expanded in the modern era
 uparyukt teen ke atiri vigyaan, praudyogiki, chikitsashastra, prashasan, kootneeti, vidhi, jansampark tathaa anya anek kshetron ke granthon or rachanaaon kaa anawaad bhi hone laga he
 The translations of the modern era tend to be bilateral in comparison to the translations of the ancient era
 aadhunik yug main anuwaad kaa aarthik or raajnneetik mahatva bhi pratishthit ho gaya he
 Bilingual texts of the form of political, economic and cultural agreements between different nations are prepared
 bahurashtriya sansthaaon ko ek se adhik bhashaaon kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
 In the United Nations, every work is done in five or six languages
 in sab main anivaary rup se anuwaad kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 There is a justification for this situation
 aadhunik yug main hui audyogic, praudyogic, aarthik or raajnneetik kranti ke falswaroop vishwa ke rashtron main ek-duusare ke nikat sampark kii aavashyaktaa kii chetana kaa ativ sheeghra vikaas hua, uske kaaran anuwaad ko yah mahatva milanaa swaabhaavik mana jaataa he
 This is the reason that if the personal interest of the translator was more than the motivational power of the ancient era, then the socio-economic-political need of translation has become a strong driving force in the modern era
 is sthiti ke anek udhaaharan milte hai
 The works of writers of linguistic minority class are translated and read more in other languages
 apekshaakrit chote tathaa bahubhashi rashtron ko apane desh ke bheetar hi vibhinn bhashabhashi samudaayon ke madhya sampark sthapit karne kii samasya kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Due to this importance of translation according to social need, translation work is now seen to be organized in an organized manner
 raajnneetik-aarthik kaarnon se utpann aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye anuwaad ab ek vyavsaay ban chukaa he tathaa vyaktigat hone ke saath-saath uskaa sanghathanaatmak rup bhi pratishthit hota dikhataa he
 In educational institutions, arrangements are made to teach translation skills and training institutes also work independently
 ek vishisht prakaar ke bhashik vyapaar ke rup main anuwaad, bhartiya parampara kii drushti se, koi nai baat nahin
 In fact, the word 'translation' and the linguistic business available from it have been in Indian tradition long back
 atah 'anuwaad' shabd or iske angreji paryaay ‘transleshan' ke vyutpattimulak or pravritimulak arthon kii sahaayta se anuwaad kii paribhaasha or uske swaroop ko shreshthatar rup se janaa ja saktaa he
 The etymological meaning of 'translation' is - re-statement; Say something once said again
 isamen 'arth kii punrariti hoti hai, shabd kii nahin
 The etymological meaning of the word 'translation' means 'transit' means to move from one place point to another
 yah sthaan-bindu bhashik paath he
 In this too, the object to be carried has meaning, not the word
 uparyukt donon shabdon main antar vyutpattimulak arth kii drushti se he, atah satahi he
 The similarity of the two is evident in actual practice
 arth kii punrariti ko hi duusare shabdon main or prakaaraantar se, arth kaa bhashaantaran kaha jaataa he, jisamen kai baar mul bhashaa kii roopaatmak-gathnaatmak visheshtaayen lakshyabhasha main sakrant ho jaati he
 In fact, the Indian tradition meaning of the word 'translation' is also valid in modern context and the nature of translation is partly understood by making it the focal point
 tadnusaar, anuwaad kaary ke teen sandarbh hai - sambhashik, anybhashik or antarasanketaparak
 In the linguistic context, the repetition of meaning occurs within the same language range, but its dimensions vary
 mukhya aayam do hai -kalkramik or samakalik
 On the chronological dimension, linguistic translation occurs in two adjacent stages of historical development of the same language, eg, translation from old Hindi to modern Hindi
 samakalik aayam par sambhashik anuwaad mukhya rup se teen staron par hota he - boli, style or madhyam
 There can be four sub-levels of bilingual translation at the dialect level: ek bhugolic boli se duusari bhugolic boli main; jaise braj se avadhi main
 From non-standard dialect to standard dialect; For example, Ganjam from Oriya to Puri or from Nagpur Marathi to Pune Marathi
 boli rup se bhashaa rup main, jaise braj yaa avadhi se hindi main From one social dialect to another social dialect, such as from the language of the uneducated or under-educated to the language of the educated or from the language of the people initiated in one religion from the language of the people initiated in the other religion
 style str par sambhashik anuwaad ko style-vikalpan ke rup main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 a good example of this is the translation from formal style to informal style; Like 'smoking is forbidden' → 'smoking cigarette smoking is prohibited'
 isi prakaar ‘tubey vaayu aadhaan main samamiti nahin rah gai
 Is' -> 'tire air has gone out'
 madhyam kii drushti se sambhashik anuwaad kii sthiti vahaan hoti he jahaan maukhik madhyam main prastut sandesh kii likhit madhyam main yaa iske vipareet punrariti kii jaae; jaise, maukhik madhyam kaa kaa ek vaakya he : "samay kii seemaa ke kaaran main apane shrotaaon ko adhik vistaar se is vishay main nahin bataa paaoonga
 "it is probably considered appropriate to say in the written medium in this way:" Due to the limitation of space, i will not be able to explain this topic in more detail to my readers
 " 
 The above examples of linguistic translation make two things clear
 arthantaran yaa arth kii punrariti kii prakriya main shabdachayan tathaa vaakya-vinyas donon prabhavit hote hai
 In medium translation, the characteristics of the phonation process take the form of characteristics of the written system or vice versa
 boli, style, or madhyam ke ayaamon ke madhya kathor vibhaajan rekha nahin, api tu inamen aanshik ativyapti pai jaati he, jisaki sambhaavna bhashaa prayog kii pravriti main hi nihit he
 As such, the partial power of stylistic translation is reflected in the medium translation, and accordingly 'to be able to explain the subject' as in the oral medium, so informal, selective, taking a touch of formality in the written medium becomes 'clarifying'
 is
 isi prakaar shailigat anuwaad main samaajik boligat anuwaad bhi kabhi-kabhi samavisht ho jaataa he
 For example, in the dialect of the educated, the formal style may have a tendency to predominance, and in the dialect of the under-educated or uneducated, the informal style may be
 sambhashik anuwaad kii samasyaayen na keval rochak hai api tu anybhashik anuwaad kii drushti se mahatvapurn bhi hai
 The importance of linguistic translation becomes even more evident when translation is seen as a mode of linguistics
 iske atirikt anybhashik anuwaad kii prakruti ko samajhane kii drushti se sambhashik anuwaad kii prakruti ko samajhnaa na keval sahaayak he, api tu aavashyak bhi he
 It can be said that translation is derived language, which has two references - bilingual and dialectical
 is sandarbh bhed se anuwaad vyavhaar main antar aa jaataa he, parantu donon hi sthitiyon main anuwaad kii prakruti vahi rahati he
 The other language translation occurs between two languages
 ye do bhashaayen aitihaasikta or kshetreeyata ke samanvit mandand par swatantra bhashaaon ke rup main pahachaani jaati hai
 Historically, languages coming in the same stream are generally seen as independent languages in that case if they are not closely embedded in chronology, such as Sanskrit and Hindi; Prakrit languages come between these two
 isi prakaar kshetreeyata kii drushti se prativeshi bhashaaon main atyadhik aadan-pradaan hone par bhi unhen bhinn bhashaayen hi maananaa hoga, jaise hindi or punjabi
 In the context of other languages translation, the independent existence of the respective languages is a matter of importance
 sambhashik anuwaad kii tulana main anybhashik anuwaad saamaajik or vyaavhaarik drushti se adhik mahatvapurn he
 From the point of view of linguistic, there is a qualitative difference between problems of linguistic translation from problems of linguistic translation
 is prakaar sambhashik anuwaad se sambandhit hote hue bhi anybhashik anuwaad, apekshaakrit swanishtha vyapaar he
 Both of the above references to the word translation are relatively limited
 inamen anuwaad ko bhashaa-sanketon kaa vyapaar mana gaya he
 In fact, language-socket is a special category of symbols, through which communication work is done
 sampreshan ke liye vibhinn kotiyon ke sanketon ko kaam main liya jaataa he
 These are called common figures
 is drushti se bhi anuwaad shabd kii paribhaasha kii jaati he
 According to this, the reiteration of what is said by one sign by another category of signs, this type of translation is called intertextual translation
 yah saamaanya sanket vigyaan ke antargat he
 The signs are divided into linguistic and linguistic, with linguistic signals considered to be the focal point
 bhashetar main do bhaag hai - bahya or aantarik 
 From the translation point of view, the following categories of sign-exchange business can be made: 1
 bahya sanket kaa bahya sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi desh kaa maanchitr us desh kaa anuwaad he; kisi praani kaa chitra us praani kaa anuwaad he
 2
 Translation of external signs into linguistic signs - According to this, any word used in a language for a creature is a translation of that creature
 is drushti se vastutah yaha bhashaa darshan kii samasya he jisaki vyakhya arth ke sanket siddhanth main kii gai he
 3
 Translation from internal signal to internal signal - According to this, translating any event into its sensory sensation is translation of this category
 spasht he ki is sthiti kii vaastavik satta nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, this category is determined only from the point of view of theory
 4
 aantarik sanket se bhashik sanket main anuwaad - iske anusaar kisi aantarik samvednaa ke liye kisi shabd kaa prayog karnaa is koti kaa anuwaad he
 It is said more clearly that, upon contact with a physical condition - eg, seeing an accident, looking at a view of nature, putting an arm on an object, smelling something; In other words, the sense of sensation that arises in the mind is a kind of sign - when the senses are in proximity
 uske liye bhashaa ke kisi shabd kaa prayog karnaa yaa bhashik sanket dwaara uski punrariti karnaa is koti kaa anuwaad kehalaayegaa
 For example, the word 'mourning' is used in Hindi to indicate a specific type of anguish and for another the word 'love'
 samajha jaataa he ki ek samvednaa kaa anuwaad ‘shok' shabd dwaara kiya jaataa he or duusari kaa 'prem' dwaara
 From this point of view it is said that the entire fundamental expression is translation
 vaktaa yaa lekhak apane samvednaa rupi sanketon kii bhashik sanketon main punrariti kar detaa he
 From this point of view, it is the problem of language psychology, which is explained in the stimulus-response theory
 is prakaar, anuwaad shabd kii vyapak paridhi main teenon sandarbhon ke anuwaadon kaa sthaan he -sambhashik anuwaad, anybhashik anuwaad, or antarasanketaparak anuwaad
 All three have their own theoretical basis
 in teenon ke madhya kaa bhed jaananaa mahatvapurn he
 The translator has to fix who is the central position among these three and how the remaining two have relation with them
 saiddhanthik auchity kii drushti se anybhashik anuwaad kii sthiti kendriya he
 Only by the word 'translation' is the meaning of the dialectical translation
 iskaa mul he dwibhashabaddhata
 In both the interpretation and expression of the translator, languages are tied to the language and these languages also differ not in terms of distinction, but in terms of code; Such as Hindi and English, Hindi and Sindhi etc
 is kendriya sthiti ke do chor hai
 On the first end, there is linguistics in both cases, but the language remains the same
 sthitiyon ko antar usee bhashaa ke bhedon ke antar par aadhaarit hota he
 This is an equilateral translation
 paribhaashik shabdon ke prayog kii spashtataa ke liye ise 'anvayaantar' yaa 'shabdaantaran' kaha jaataa he
 At the other end, there is a change in the linguistic signal to the language
 sanket paddati kaa yah parivartan bhashaa prayog kii saamaanya sthiti ko janm detaa he
 In terminology it is called 'language practice'
 in teenon main sambandh tathaa antar donon hai
 This relationship is common
 anuwaad kii drushti se mahatvapurn baat yah he ki vaastavik anuwaad kaary main tathaa anudit paath ke moolyankan main anuvaadakon ko sambhashik anuwaad tathaa antarasanketaparak anuwaad kii sankalpanaaon se sahaayta milti he
 This requirement comes out clearly only when the translator is stuck while doing the translation - the original text is unable to be understood, it is difficult to adequately explore the pure and appropriate translation in the target language, the translator would have to check it How successful the translation is, etc
 pravritimulak main 'anuwaad' shabd se anybhashik anuwaad kaa hi arth liya jaataa he
 And for this reason, Shanai: Shanai: It has also become a matter of principle that translation is a process between two languages
 is sthiti kaa sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 The word 'chhaya' in Sanskrit tradition is used to indicate this situation
 anuwaad ke swaroop ko samajhane ke liye anuwaad kii paribhaasha vishesh rup se sahaayak he
 Given the multilaterality of translation, the definition of translation has been presented from various perspectives
 mukhya drushtikon teen prakaar ke hai - anuwaad ek prakriya he
 Translation is a process or / and its result
 anuwaad ek sambandh kaa naam he
 The following definitions are cited under this approach: "mulbhasha ke sandesh ke samamoolya sandesh ko lakshyabhasha main prastut karne kii kriya ko anuwaad kehete hai
 This value of messages is first in terms of meaning and then style, and is near and natural
 " "translation is the process by which meaningful experiences are communicated from one language-community to another
 " "installing the text of one language by synonyms of another language is called translation
