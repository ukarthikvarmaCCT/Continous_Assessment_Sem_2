 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga jab sampoorn jagat jalmagn tha or bhagwaan vishnu sheshnag kii shayya bichhaakar yoganidra kaa aashray le so rahe the, us samay unke kaanon ke mile se madhu or kaitabha do bhayankar asur utpann hue
 Both of them agreed to kill Brahmaji
 bhagwaan vishnu ke nabhikmal main virajman prajapati brahmaji ne jab un donon bhayanak asuron ko apane paas aayaa or bhagwaan ko soya hua dekha, tab ekagrachitt hokar unhone bhagwaan vishnu ko jagaane ke liye unke netron main nivas karanevaali yoganidra kaa stvan armbh kiya
 Those who are the super power of this world, the one who holds the world, the one who follows and destroys the world, and the formless power of Lord Vishnu, the same, started praising Lord Brahma of Bhagwati Nidradevi
 brahmaji ne kaha- devi! tumhiin is jagat kii utpatti, sthiti or sanhaar karanevaali ho
 May you be a living soul
 devi! tumhiin sandhya, savitri tathaa param janani ho
 You wear this world-universe
 tumse hi is jagat kii sristi hoti he
 You follow this and always make everyone your grass at the end of your cycle
 jaganmayi devi! is jagat kii utpatti ke samay tum sristirupa ho, paalan-kaal main sthitirupa ho tathaa kalpant ke samay sanhaarroop dhaaran karanevaali ho
 You are Mahavidya, Mahamaya, Mahamedha, Mahasmriti, Mahamoharupa, Mahadevi and Mahasuri
 tumhiin teenon gunon ko utpann karanevaali sabaki prakruti ho
 You should also be a fierce Kaalratri, Maharatri and Mohratri
 tumhiin shri, tumhiin ishwari, tumhiin hri or tumhiin bodhswaroopa buddhi ho
 You should also be ashamed, affirmed, satisfied, peace and forgiveness
 tum khadgadharaini, shuldharini, ghorroopa tathaa gada, chakra, shankh or dhanush dhaaran karanevaali ho
 Arms, Bhusundi and Parigha - these are also your weapons
 tum saumy or saumytar ho-itnaa hi nahin, jitne bhi saumy evam sundar padaarth hai, un sabaki apeksha tum atyadhik sundari ho
 But you are the God who lives above and beyond
 sarvaswaroope devi! kahin bhi sat-asatrup jo kuch vastuen hai or un sabaki jo shakti he, vah tumhiin ho
 In such a state, what can be your praise? Who can be able to praise you when you have created, nurtured and killed this world, even those Gods who have subjected you to sleep? You have got me, Lord Shankar and Lord Vishnu as well; So, who has the power to praise you? Devi! These two who are evil demons Madhu and Catabh, put them in fascination and awaken Jagadishwar Lord Vishnu soon
 saath hi inke bheetar in donon mahaan asuron ko maar daalane kii buddhi utpann kar do
 In this way, the goddess Yoganidra, the presiding deity of Tamoguna, came out from the site of Lord's eyes, mouth, nose, arms, heart and chest: appeared before Brahmaji
 yoganidra se mukt hone par bhagwaan janardan us ekarnav ke jal main sheshnag kii shayya se jaag uthe
 He saw both mighty asuras who were doing business to eat Brahma Ji with red eyes
 tab bhagwaan srihari ne donon ke saath paanch hajaar varsho tak keval bahuyuddh kiya
 After this, when Mahamaya tempted both the asuras, they became obliged and asked God to ask for the groom
 bhagwaan ne kaha ki yadi mujh par prasann ho to mere haathon maare jaao
 Asuras said that where the earth is not immersed in water, kill us there
 tab bhagwaan ne tathastu kahkar donon ke mastakon ko apni jaangh par rakh liya tathaa chakra se kaat daalaa
 Thus Goddess Mahamaya appeared on praising Brahma
 kamaljanma brahmaji dwaara stavit mahakali apane das haathon main khadg, chakra, gada, baan, dhanush, parigh, shul, bhushundi, mastak or shankh dhaaran karti hai

 This paper used a mixed form of both Braj and Khadiboli which the operators of this paper called "madhya Pradesh language"

 sookshmjaiviki un sookshmjivon kaa adhyayan he, jo eckoshikeey yaa sookshmdarsheey koshika-samooh jantu hote hai
 These include fungi and protists such as eukaryotes, and prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea
 vishaanuon ko sthaayee taur par jeev yaa praani nahin kaha gaya he, phir bhi isi ke antargat inkaa bhi adhyayan hota he
 In short, microbiology is the study of living organisms that are not visible with the naked eye
 sookshmjaiviki ati vishaal shabd he, jisamen vishaanu vigyaan, kavak vigyaan, paraseete vigyaan, jeevanu vigyaan, va kai anya shakhaayen aatin hai
 There are quick researches in microbiology and this field is on the path of continuous progress
 abhi tak hamane shaayad puri prithvi ke sookshmjivon main se ek pratishat kaa hi adhyayan kiya he
 Although microorganisms were seen about three hundred years ago, microbiology is at its very early stage in comparison to other branches of biology, such as animal science or plant science
 sookshmjivon ke astitv kaa anumaan unki khoj se kai shatabdiyon purv laga liya gaya tha
 The first theory on these was given by the ancient Roman scholar Marcus Terenceius Varro in a book on his agriculture
 isamen unhone chetavanee di thi ki daldal ke nikat khet nahin banaae jane chahie
 In a book entitled Canon of Medicine, Abu Ali ibn Sina states that body secretions are contaminated by external microorganisms before they become infected
 unhone kshay rog va anya sankramak bimariyon ke sankramak swabhaav kii pariklpana kii thi, va sangrodh kaa prayog sankramak bimariyon kii rokthaam hetu kiya tha
 When the black death and bubonic plague reached al-andalus in the fourteenth century, Ibn Khatima estimated that microorganisms reach the human body and cause infectious diseases
 1546 main jirolamo fracastoro ne yah prastaav diya ki mahamariyaan sthanantaraneey beej jaise astitvon dwaara failati hai
 These items can be infected directly or indirectly even at long distances without contact
 sookshmjivon ke bare main ye sabhi daawey anumaan maatr hi the kyonki ye kisi aankadon yaa vigyaan par aadhaarit nahin the
 By the seventeenth century, micro-organisms were neither proven nor seen
 inako satrahavin shatabdi main hi sahi taur par dekha gaya tathaa varnit kiya gaya
 The basic reason for this was that all the earlier information and research was done in the absence of a basic tool, which was necessary for the existence of microbiology or bacteriology and that was the microscope
 antony won luvenhok pratham sookshmjeevvaigyanik the jinhone pehali baar sookshmjivon ko sookshmdarshi yantra se dekha tha, isi kaaran unhen sookshmjaiviki kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 It was he who invented the microscope instrument
 jeevanu va sookshmjivon ko sarvapratham antony won luvenhok ne 1676 main swanirmit ekal-lens sookshmdarshi se dekha tha
 By doing this, he did an unprecedented work in the field of biology, through which bacteriology and microbiology started
 bacterium shabd kaa prayog kaaphi baad main ehrenberg dwaara hua
 It derives from the Greek word βακτηριον, which means - little stem
 haloki luvenhok ko pratham sookshmjaivijna kaha gaya he, kintu pratham manyata praapt sookshmjaivik robert hook ko mana jaataa he jinhone mold ke falan kaa avlokan kiya tha
 The bacteriology is believed to have been established by Ferdinand Kohn
 ye ek padapavaigyanik the, jinke shaiwal va prakashasanshleshit jeevanu par kiye gaye shodh ne unhen basilas va baggeyatoa sahit kai anya jeevanuon kaa varnan karne ko prerit kiya tha
 Kohn was the first person to define the scheme of classification of bacteria
 lui pashchar va robert coach kohn ke samakaleen the tathaa unako ayurvigyaan sookshmjaiviki kaa sansthaapak mana jaataa he
 Pasteur had become famous for the graded experiments he had done to disprove the theory of the then spontaneous production
 isise sookshmjaiviki kaa dharaatal or thos ho gaya
 Pasteur had found food preservation measures, he had discovered the safety vaccines of many diseases including anthrax, foul cholera and rabies
 coach apane rogon ke jeevanu siddhant ke liye prasiddh the, jiske anusaar koi vishisht rog, kisi vishisht rogajanak sookshmjeev ke kaaran hi hota he
 He was the one who made the Kochs postulates
 coach shuddh culture main se jeevanuon ke pruthakeekaran karne vaale vaigyanikon main se pratham rahe hai
 As a result, many new bacteria can be discovered and described, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which was also the root organism of Tuberculosis
 pashchar evam coach praayah sookshmjaiviki ke janak kahe jate hai parantu unka kaary sahi dhang se sookshmjaivik sansar kii vaastavik vividhta ko nahin darshata he, kyonki unak dhyaan pratyaksh chikitsa sambandhi sandarbhon vaale sookshmjivon par hi kendrit rahaa
 It was only after the works of Martinus William Beijerink and Sergey Vinogradski, who are said to be the founders of general microbiology, that the precise periphery of microbiology was realized
 beijrink ke sookshmjaiviki main do mahaan yogadan hai: vishaanuon kii khoj tathaa upjau sanvardhan takanic kaa vikaas
 His research work on tobacco mosaics virus established the basic principles of virology
 yah unke enrichment culture kaa vikaas tha, jiskaa tatkshanik prabhaav sookshmjaiviki par padaa
 Through this, a series of large microorganisms could be cultivated, which had a wide variety of physiology
 vinogradski ne acarbonic rasinic padaarthon par pratham siddhant prastut kiya tha, jiske saath hi sookshmjivon kii bhuraceinic prakriyaaon main atimahatvapurn bhoomika ujagar hui
 He was the first to isolate nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria
 sookshm jivi anek prakaar ke hote hai jinamein jeevanu pramukh hai
 a bacterium is a unicellular organism
 iskaa aakaar kuch millimetre tak hi hota he
 Their shape can be from round or free-circular to the shape of rods etc
 ye prokariotic, koshika bhittiyukt, ekkoshkeey saral jeev hai jo praayah sarvatra paye jate he
 They are found in the soil on the earth, in acidic hot water streams, in nuclear materials, in water, in the earth's crust, even in organic matter and within the bodies of plants and animals
 saadharantah ek gram mitti main 4 karod jeevanu kosh tathaa 1 millilitre jal main 10 lakh jeevanu paae jate hai
 Approximately 5X1030 bacteria are found all over the Earth
 jo sansar ke biomas kaa ek bahut bada bhaag he
 They play a very important role in the cycle of many elements, such as the stabilization of nitrogen for the atmosphere
 halaaki bahut saare vansh ke jeevanuon kaa shrenee vibhaajan bhi nahin hua he tathaapi lagbhag aadhon kii kisi na kisi jati ko prayogshaala main ugaaya ja chukaa he
 Bacteria are studied under bacteriology which is a branch of microbiology
 maanav sharir main jitani maanav koshikaaye hai, uske lagbhag 10 guna adhik jeevanu kosh he
 Most of these bacteria are found in the skin and the esophagus
 hanikaarak jeevanu suraksha tantra ke rakshak prabhaav ke kaaran sharir ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaa pate he
 Some bacteria are also beneficial
 anek prakaar ke paraseete jeevanu kai rog utpann karte hai, jaise - haija, miyadi bukhaar, nimonia, tapedic yaa kshayrog, plig ityadi
 Only about 2 million people die every year from tuberculosis, most of them from the sub-saharan region

 In the industrial area, fermentation of bacteria produces curd, cheese etc
 items
 inkaa upyog pratijaiviki tathaa or rasayanon ke nirmaan main tathaa jaevpraudyogiki ke kshetra main hota he
 Apart from this, viruses which are micro-organisms
 ve sharir ke baahar to mrit hote hai parantu sharir ke andar jivit ho jate hai
 They can be assembled as crystals
 kavak jo ek prakaar ke paudhe hai, apana bhojan sade gale mrrit carbonic padaarthon se praapt karte hai or jinka sabase bada laabh sansar main apamarjak ke rup main kaary karnaa he, protozoa jo ek eckoshikeey jeev he, jisaki koshikayen ukariotic prakaar kii hoti hai or saadhaaran sookshmdarshi yantra se aasaani se dekhe ja saktaa he, orchia yaa archibacteria jo apane saral rup main bacteria jaise hi hote hai par unki kosiya sanrachana kaafii alag hoti he
 And algae which are simple living, like plants make their own food by the process of photosynthesis in the presence of sunlight and can be in many forms from unicellular to multicellular, but like plants it has roots, leaves etc
 The compositions not found also fall under the category of microorganisms
 sookshmjeev jaise jeevanu tathaa vishaanu atyant sookshm hote hai parantu inaki sanrachana saral hoti hai
 Microscopic instruments have an important role in their study
 electron sookshmdarshi yantra ke avishkaar ke baad to inkaa adhyayan or bhi saral ho gaya he
 The magnification capacity of electron microscopes is thousands of times greater than ordinary or compound microscopes
 isse sookshmjivon ko vaastavik aakaar se lakhon guna bada karke dekha jaataa he
 Their methods have been simplified after the discovery of methods of staining bacteria
 gram sten kii sahaayta se jeevanuon kaa vargeekaran evam adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The colony of bacteria is grown by cultivation in the laboratory
 is prakaar se ugaai gai jeevanu-colony jeevanuon par shodh karne main atyant upyogi siddh hui he
 The field of microbiology for study is often divided into several subfields: microbiological physiology This includes the study of how microbiological cells perform biochemical functions, and microbiological production, microbial metabolism and microbial cell structure
 sookshmjaivik anuvaanshiki ismensookshmjivon main jin tathaa unki koshikeey kriyaaon ke sambandh main, ve kis prakaar vyavasthit va niyamit hote hai, isaki jaankaree praapt kii jaati he
 This category is closely related to the field of molecular biology

 iesao code: mrg Treatment-centered psychiatry or person-centered therapy or non-medical therapy is a method of mental treatment in which the patient is kept constantly active and attempts to make them healthy without giving any instructions
 prakarantar se yah swasangrakshan he jisamen na to rogi ko chikitsak par nirbhar rakhaa jaataa he or na hi uske sammukh paristhitiyon ko vyakhya kii jaati he iske vipareet rogi ko paroksh rup se sahaayta dekar uske gyanatmak evam samvegatmak kshetra ko paripakv banane kii cheshtaa kii jaati he taaki vah apane ko vartmaan tathaa bhavishya kii paristhitiyon se samyojit kar sake
 In this, it is only the responsibility of the doctor to keep proper management of the system of "self-preservation" for the patient, because the cooperation of the doctor is not only necessary but also necessary to make adjustments in the emotional area of the patient
 anirdeshaatmak chikitsavidhi manovishleshan se kaaphi milti-julati he
 In both, there is complete freedom for the expression of sentiment desires presented at the conscious-subconscious level

 There are five levels of this method: upachaaraarthi kaa sahaytarth aagaman : yah rogi ke sakriy sahyog kii bhoomika he
 The therapist makes it clear at the outset that he does not have a response to the patient's problems with his body language, color and manner
 haan, sampark main aane par rogi ko aisi sthiti kaa abhas avashya hoga jisamen vah apni samasyaon kaa samaadhaan avashyak kar sake

 The rise of self-confidence leads to a change in his ideology and he feels an obligation
 upachaarak kii sahaayta use nahin chahie or 'vah paryaapt he' - yah bhav usamen udit or drudh ho jaataa he

 Srinivas popularized in the 1950s
 haalaanki iske isse puraane ullekh bhimrao ambedkar krit casts in india: dir mechainizam, jenessis and develpment main mil sakate hai
 The earliest references to this process of "walking upward and downward in the social ladder" are found in another reference, "the Laws of Imitation", written by Gabriel Tarde
 shrinivas ne samskruthikaran kii paribhaasha dete hue kaha ki "is prakriya main nichali yaa madhyam hindu jati yaa janajati yaa koi anya samooh, apni prathaon, ritiyon or jeevanstyli ko ucch yaa praayah dwij jatiyon kii disha main badal lete hai
 Often, with such a change, they also become claimants of a higher status in the caste system than that which the local community has traditionally offered them



 " a clear example of Sanskritisation is the adoption of pure vegetarianism by the people of the so-called "lower castes", in imitation of the Dwij castes, which are not traditionally opposed to non-vegetarian food

 The book was an anthropological study of the Kodava community of Karnataka
 shrinivas ne pustak main likhaa: "the caste system is far from a rigid system in which the position of each component caste is fixed for all time
 Movement has always been possible, and especially in the middle regions of the hierarchy
 a caste was able, in a generation or two , to rise to a higher position in the hierarchy by adopting vegetarianism and teetotalism, and by Sanskritizing its ritual and pantheon
 In short, it took over, as far as possible, the customs, rites, and beliefs of the Brahmins, and adoption of The Brahminic way of life by a low caste seems to have been frequent, though theoretically forbidden
 This process has been called 'sanskritization' in this book, in preference to 'brahminization', as certain Vedic rites are confined to the Brahmins and the two other 'twice-born' castes
 " is pustak ne tab chal rahe is vichaar ko chunauti di ki jati ek drudh or aparivartansheel sanstha he
 The concept of Sanskritisation helped in subjects like complexity of castes

 The term Sanskritization is also used for this concept in many places in Hindi, which is impure in terms of Sanskrit rules

 He had earlier complained about this to Ferrari's After Sales Service, which he considered to be inferior
 lagaataar ek hi tarah kii samasyaon se pareshaan hokar va ek lambey intjaar ke baad, vah is maamle ko lekar company ke sansthaapak"ii commandator", anzo pheraari ke paas gaye
 What happened next is an example of him becoming a great personality: According to 1991's Threadbread and Classic Car magazine, which interviewed Lamborghini, he complained as an argument with Enzo and told him that his cars were incompetent
 
 atyant behude va behad garv se bhare modenon ne krodhit ho kar pramukh nirmaan udhyami se kaha, "lemborgini, shaayad tum ek tractor sahi dhang se chalaane main sakasham ho, lekin ek pheraari ko tum kabhi bhi thik se sambhaal nahin paaoge
" anzo pheraari kii lemborgini ke bare main apmanjanak tippanee ke parinaam gambhir the
 Lamborghini later said that at that time he considered that if Enzo Ferrari, or anyone else, could not make them a good car, they could easily make such a car for themselves
 tractor nirmaan ke pramukh udhyami ne mahasoos kiya ki pheraari kaaron main ek behatar bhavy yatri car ke gun nahin the
 Lamborghini believed that such a car should perform well, without compromising on the superior level, ride quality and interior
 is vishwaas ke saath ki ve bhi mahaan pheraari se behatar pradarshan kar sakate hai, pive di sento laut kar lemborgini or unke shramikon ne tractor factory main apane 250GT main se ek ko kholaa or us par kaam shuru kar diya
 The simple single overhead camshaft cylinder head was replaced with other units and six horizontally mounted dual carburettors fitted over the V12 engine
 lemborgini sanshodhit car ko modena ke paas motorve pravesh dwaar par le gayi or pheraari ke test dryveronki pratiksha karne lage
 According to Lamborghini, the improvements made his car at least 25 km / h faster than that factory's cars and it could easily outrun testers
 kuch logon kaa tark he ki lemborgini ne keval automobile ke vyapaar main isliye pravesh kiya taaki pratidwandi pheraari ko yah dikhaa saken ki ve uski bahumoolya ghode mark kaaron se behatar car kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai tathaa marnello camp se tej, acchhee banaavat vaali va adhik taqatvar car bana sakate hai
 Others argue that they saw only a financial opportunity in producing such cars, Lamborghini realized that the parts he would put on his tractors could make three times as much profit if fitted in a high-performance luxury car
 Huh
 yah ek aitihaasik pratidwandvita kii shuruyaat thi : farushiyo or anzo ne phir kabhi baatcheet nahin kii
 In July 1963, a billboard was erected in the street of St
 Agata Bollonis, via Modena, less than 30 kilometers from Santo
 46,000 varg meter jagah main shaan se khadey us board par likhaa tha - "quee steblimento lemborgini automobile" angrezi: Lamborghini car factory here
 30 oktober 1963 ko company kaa nirmaan hua tathaa automobily lemborgini sosieta par azioni kaa gathan hua
 Ferruccio Lamborghini opened his automobile factory in St
 Agata for several reasons
 communist shahar netritv ke saath ek anukool vittiya samjhaute kaa matlab tha ki unhen apane vyapaar ke pehle das varshon ke munaafe par kar nahin dena tha, saath hi unke dwaara praapt kiye gaye laabh ko bank main jamaa karne par 19% kii byaaj dar bhi milani thi
 Under this agreement, their employees were to be organized
 nirmaan sthal, italy ke automobile udyog ke bich hone kaa arth tha ki lemborgini ke kriya kalapon ke liye mashin kii dukaanon, kochbilders tathaa motor vaahan udyog main anbhavi shramikon tak pahunch atyant saral thi
 Even before venturing into the vehicle manufacturing industry, Lamborghini hired the services of engineer Giotto Bizzarini
 bijarini tathakthith "gang of five" kaa ek hissaa tha jo 1961 main pheraari se prasiddh 250 GTO viksit karne ke baad bade paimaane par hue palaayan kaa ek bhaag tha
 Lamborghini hired him independently and asked him to design a V12 engine that was as large as a Ferrari 3-liter power plant, but unlike Ferrari's unsuitable race engine, ready for use in a road car from the start
 Be done
 bijarini ko is kaam ke liye l 45 lakh, tathaa ingine dwaara pheraari sanskaran se zyada utpann kiye ja sakane vaali brake horse power kii prayek unit, par bonus kaa bhugtan kiya janaa tha
 The designer built a 3
5-liter, 9
5: 1 compression ratio, 360 bhp engine that began running for the first time on May 15, 1963, in a corner of the Lamborghini tractor factory
 bijarini ne dry-samp lubrication se ingine banaaya jo 9,800 rpm par apni adhiktam horse power utpann karata tha, lekin shaayad hi ek sadak par chalane vaali car ke ingine ke laayak tha
 Lamborghini, who wanted a well-behaved engine for use in his lavish passenger car, was outraged and ordered excessive changes to the engine's design
 is jhagade ke parinamswaroop lemborgini or bijarini ke rishton main daraar aa gayi or use tab tak uske kaary kaa puraa muaavja nahin mila jab tak ki adaalaton ne lemborgini ko aisa karne kaa aadesh nahin diya
 Lamborghini now had an engine, but needed a vehicle to fit it
 1963 tak unhonen jiyaan poulo dallara, jo yudgh ke baad ke samay kaa sabase kushal chasis engeenior tha, ke saath logon kii ek team is kaary ke liye bana lee
 pheraari or macerati ke saath kaam kar chuke, dallara ko lemborgini kii car banane kaa incharge niyukt kiya gaya
 Dallara gathered a capable team of men, including his college assistant, Paulo Stenziani, and Bob Wallace from New Zealand, who then worked in Maserati, known for his deep understanding of chassis handling and excellent detailing and development Used to go farushiyo ne, vinaale, ghia, bertone or pininfrina jaise ucch naamon ko khaarij kar diya tathaa iske badale apekshaakrit agyaat diziner franco skalione ko car kii banaavat dijin karne ke liye niyukt kiya
 The car was ready for the 1963 Torino Motor Show in just four months within the time limit
 prototip 350GTV ko press main zordaar pratikriya mili
 Due to a dispute over the engine design with Bizzarini, no power plant was available ahead of time for the car to be unveiled
 lore ke anusaar, farushiyo ne sunishchit kiya ki car kaa hud eenton ko sahi tarah se chupa kar rakhe500 pound taaki car upyukt oonchai par dikhe
 Despite positive reviews, Lamborghini was not happy with the build quality of the prototype, and announced that it would discontinue it
 car agle bees saal ke liye store main rahi, jab tak ki ise ek sthaneey colector dwaara karidaa tathaa phir se chaalu nahin kiya gaya
 With the GTV 350 as a start, its design was again designed by Milan's Carrosaria Touring and the new chassis was built at its factory
 ingine ko bijarini kii ichha ke viruddh sanshodhit kiya gaya
 The new car, which resembled the 350GT, was shown at the 1964 Geneva Motor Show
 farushiyo ne ubaldo sgarji ko uskaa bikri prabandhak niyukt kiya; sgarji ne purv main bhi yahi bhoomika techno es

 Lamborghini and Sgarzi found similar flaws in the factory, a perspective that did not coincide with the wishes of the engineers who developed the car
 1964 ke ant tak, 13 graahakon ke liye kaaren ban chuki thim jinhen pheraari ke saath pratispardhaa karne ke liye nuksaan main bechaa gaya
 The 350GT remained in production for two more years, selling a total of 120 units
 jiyaan paolo dallara ne bijarini ke V12 dizin main sudhaar laane kii chunauti sweekaar kii, displacement ko 3

 ingine ko sarvapratham 350GT chasis ke andar feet kiya gaya, jise 'antarim 400GT' car ke rup main janaa jaataa he, tathaa jisaki 23 ikaiyon kaa utpaadan kiya gaya
 By 1966, a longer 2 + 2 version of the 350GT was developed and the 400GT with the open space was unveiled at the Geneva Auto Show
 yah car safal huyi tathaa isaki kul 250 ikaiyaan biki, jisase lemborgini apane kaarkaane main shramikon kii sankhya 170 tak badhaane main sakasham hue

 Lamborghini particularly noted the importance of continuous service for car owners and introduced a facility that was capable of moving from small service to large work
 1965 ke dauraan, dallara, stenjani or wales ne P400 naamak ek prototip ke vikaas main apana samay lagaaya
 ejiniyaron ne ek sadak car banane ke liye sochaa, jisamen racing kii bhi khubiyaan hon
 ek aisi car jo trek par jeet sake tathaa jise utsaahi logon dwaara sadak par chalaaya ja sake
 The three worked on the design of the vehicle at night in the hope that they would change Lamborghini's opinion that such a vehicle would be too expensive and distracted by the company's goal
 lemborgini ne ek achche prachaar madhyam ke rup main dekhte hue is pariyojna ko aage badhaane kii ijaajat de di
 The P400 had a tilted mid engine

 Bertone was in charge of prototype styling
 car ko 1966 geneva motor sho se chand din pehle chatak naarangi rang se ranga gaya
 Surprisingly, none of the engineers had time to see whether its engine fit perfectly in the compartment
 As they were committed to displaying the car, they decided to fill the mud instead of keeping the engine and keep the hood closed as they had done when the 350GTV was introduced
 bikri prabandhak sgarji ko motor press ke sadasyon ko dur rakhane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya jo P400 kaa power plant dekhnaa chaahate the
 Despite this weakness, the car was the highlight of the show, making stylist Marcello Gandini a star
 geneva main anukool pratikriya milane kaa arth tha ki P400 ko agle saal tak miura ke naam se utpaadan main janaa tha
 Both of Lamborghini's desired approaches were completed; Miura established Auto Maker as a new leader in the world of super cars and the 400GT was a sophisticated road car that Lamborghini had conceived since inception
 automobile or anya vyavsaayon main unnati ke kaaran, farushiyo lemborgini kaa jivan ek ucch str par pahunch gaya tha
 By the end of 1966, the number of employees at the St
 Agata factory had reached 300
 1967 main miura kaa vikaas kaarykram shuru karne ke liye utsuk kharidaaron dwaara kaaphi paisa jamaa kara diya gaya tha
 Ferruccio's differences with his engineering team continued on the subject of Miura being involved in racing
 pehali chaar kaaron ko factory main rakhaa gaya, jahaan bob wales ne car ko behatar or parishkrut karne kaa kaam jari rakhaa

 The Miura set an example as a high-performance sports car with two seats and a mid-engine
 kaarkaane main 400GT ke saath saath kai 350 GTS rodsters kaa utpaadan jari rakhaa gaya
 Ferruccio hired a coachbuilder to build a possible alternative based on the same chassis of the 400GT

 In view of the increasing financial difficulties, Touring closed the factory later that year

 Marazzi improved his design according to Lamborghini's decision

 Nevertheless he was happy with this car as it was a grand passenger car with well developed and reliable, which Ferruccio enjoyed driving
 islero ne bazaar par zyada asar nahin daalaa tathaa 1968 or 1969 ke bich isaki kul 125 gaadiyaan bechin gayin
 The new version of the Miura arrived in 1968; The Miura P400 showcased a rigid chassis and power, with the V12 producing 370 bhp at 7000 rpm
 1968 brusselles auto sho main, automekar ne miura P400 rodster,, khulne vaali chat kii gaadi, kaa anaavaran kiya
 Gandini, who until now was the head of the design at Bertone, had given considerable attention to the car's features such as problems with the sound of a wind hitting and the sound of a roadster
 Despite Gandini's hard work, Sgarzi had to convince potential buyers, as Lamborghini and Bertone did not agree on size during production of the Roadster
 miura spidar ko ek america dhaatu mishra dhaatu aapurtikarta, jo ise pradarshan kii vastu ke rup main upyog karnaa chahta tha, ko bech diya gaya
 1968 was a positive time for all of Ferruccio's businesses and Automobili delivered more than 353 cars during the year
 bertone ek nayi chaar siton vaali car ko dizin karne ke liye lemborgini ko manaane main kaamyaab rahaa

 The Espada was a major success with a total production of 1217 cars over ten years

 The racing program could have been a beneficial deal due to the increased profits
 lekin lemborgini iske prototip ke nirmaan ke bhi khilaaf the, apane mishan ke bare main unke vichaar the : "mujhe dosha rahit GT kaaren banane kii ichha he - jo kaaphi saamaanya, paaramparik lekin ati uttam hon - na ki ek technical bam

 dallara ke durbhaagya se, de tomaso kaa F1 kaarykram dhan kii kami se ruk gaya or vaahan nirmaataa bahut mushkil se bachaa; ejeeniyar ne iske turant baad company chhod di
 In 1969, Automobili Lamborghini faced his entire labor union related problem
 As part of a national campaign due to the strained relationship between the metal workers' union and the Italian industry, machine workers and fabricators began taking a one-hour symbolic break
 farushiyo lemborgini, jo aksar apni aasteen chadha kar factory ke kaaryon main shaamil rahete the, avarodhon ke baavjood apane karmchaariyon ko unke samuhik lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye lagaataar kaam jari rakhane ke liye prerit karne main safal rahe
 Throughout the year, the Lamborghini product range, which at the time included Islero, Espada and Miura S, continued to improve
 miura kii shakti badhaai gayi, islero main or sudhaar kiya gaya or aspada main aaraam or pradarshan ke sudhaaron ko gati mili 100 mile / ghanta islero kaa sthaan jarama 400GT dwaara liya janaa tha, jiskaa namakaran milte julate naam vaale res trek ke naam ke naam par rakhane ke bajaae spain ke ek kshetra jo bul fiting ke liye prasiddh he, ke naam par rakhaa gaya
 The car's chassis was small but aimed to outperform the Espada

 At the time the Jarama was being unveiled at the 1970 Geneva Show, Paulo Stenzany was working on a new design that did not use any parts of previous Lamborghini cars

 The 2 + 2 was a practically chosen style, since Ferruccio thought that the Urraco bosses could be children
 stenzani dwaara dizin single overhead cam V8 5000 rpm par 220 biechpi utpann karti thi
 Bob Wallace immediately engaged in road testing and development as the car was to be presented at the 1970 Turin Motor Show
 1970 main lemborgini ne miura, jo ek agrani model tha, ke vikalp kaa vikaas shuru kiya, lekin aantarik shor str tathaa unke brands ke aadarshon ke vipareet hone ke kaaran farushiyo lemborgini ne ise asweekrut kar diya
 Engineers designed a new and longer chassis so that the engine could be positioned further away from the driver's seat
 iskaa prototip marcelo gandini dwaara bertone main taiyaar kiya gaya tha tathaa yah company ke V8 LP-500 ke 4
97 litre sanskaran par aadhaarit tha
 The car was showcased at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show with Miura's final modification, the P400 supervelos
 lemborgini shrinkhalaa ko aspada 2, urrako P250 or jarama GT ne puraa kiya
 When the world financial crisis started, the companies of Ferruccio Lamborghini faced financial difficulties
 In 1971, the Lamborghini Tractor Company, which exported about half of its production, got into difficulties
 sento jo trutori kaa dakshin africa ayatak tha, ne sabhi order radd kar die
 After a successful coup, the new military government of Bolivia canceled a large order of tractors which was partially ready to be shipped from Geneva

 In 1972, Lamborghini sold Trattori to another tractor manufacturer, Sem

 Vehicle manufacturer growth slowed
 1972 geneva sho main LP500 kaa utpaadan sanskaran nahin dikhaaya ja sakaa or keval jarama ke P400 GTS sanskaran kaa pradarshan kiya gaya
 In view of the need to cut costs, Paulo Stenzani closed the LP500 power plant to produce a smaller 4-liter engine
 farushiyo lemborgini automobily or trutori ke liye khariddaaron ko aamantran dena shuru kar diya
 He started negotiations with George Henry Rosetti, a wealthy Swiss industrialist and friend of Ferruccio, as well as an Islero and Espada owner
 farushiyo ne company ke 51% share rosetty ko 600,000 US$ main beche jisase unke dwaara sthapit vaahan nirmaan company se unka niyantran khatm ho gaya
 He continued to work at the St
 Agata factory
 rosetty shaayad hi kabhi automobily ke maamalon main khud ko shaamil karte the
 The 1973 oil crisis affected the sale of high-performing cars from manufacturers around the world, rising oil prices led governments to enact new fuel economy laws and ask customers to explore shorter and more practical modes of transportation
 This led to severe damage to the gorgeous sports cars of Lamborghini, which were powered by high-powered engines and consumed excess gasoline
 1974 main, farushiyo lemborgini ne company kii apni shesh 49% hissedari ko jorge henry rosetty ke mitra rene limar ko bech diya
 He severed ties with all the cars attached to his name, and then took a property on the banks of Lake Trasimeno in Panicarola, the village of Castillon de Lago, state of Perugia, in the Umbria region of central Italy, where he lived until his last days
 1974 main, LP500 kaa antat kaauntach ke rup main utpaadan shuru hua jiskaa naam ek pidamontese bhediye kii aawaaj par rakhaa gaya jo nukchiyo bertone ne LP500 kii nangi chasis dekh kar nikaali thi, us samay ise "project 112" kaha jaataa tha

 1976 main, urrako P300 roopantarit ho kar silhoot ke naam se ai jisamen ek khulne vaali chat tathaa 3 litre V8 laga tha
 Its poor quality, unreliability and poor ability worked against it
 tathy yah he ki ise america main keval "avaidh bazaar" ke madhyam se aayaat kiya gaya
 With only 54 vehicles produced, the Countach also lacked direct participation in the US market until its LP500 version was released in 1982

 To revive it, Lamborghini received $ 50 million in cash
 The new owner of the vehicle manufacturing company was keen to enter the "extra premium" sports car market, which was around 5000 cars per year worldwide

 us samay, lemborgini main kaauntach ke vikalp kaa nirmaan ho rahaa tha
 Diablo is named after a violent bull, which died in Madrid during the 19th century
 diablo kaa mul dizin marcelo gandini, ek diggaj jinhonen kochailder bertone ke liye kaam karte samay miura tathaa kaauntach kii baheri banaavat dijin kii thi, dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 However, Chrysler officials were not happy with Gandini's work and hired his American carmaker's design team to make major changes to the car's design, including the trademark sharp edges and corners rounded to Gandini's original design
 Included
 italian taiyaar utpaada ko dekh kar zyada prabhavit nahin hua
 Diablo was intended to be released in time for September 1988
 jab lemborgini apni 25veen varshganth kaa jashn manaa rahi thi
 When it was clear that the mark would not recur, the final version of Countach was taken into production
 varshganth kaauntach ko baad main kaaron ke behtareen sanskaran ke rup main saraahaa gaya
 By the end of 1987, Emil Novaro returned after his prolonged illness and, using his authority, prevented Chrysler's intervening intervention in the development of Diablo
 Irritated like a fighting bull, the Chrysler displayed a four-door car at the Frankfurt Auto Show, inscribed 'A Chrysler powered by Lamborghini'
 Portofino faced a poor response from the Motor Press and Lamborghini employees alike
 But it became the inspiration for the Dodge Intrepid sedan
 april 1988 main bertone dwaara utpaadit ek kwatrovalvo V12 dwaara sanchalit lemborgini brands kaa vaahan torino motor sho main dikhaaya gaya jo minivain jaisaa dikhataa tha

 Profits crossed the $ 1 million mark in 1991 and Lamborghini entered a positive era
 kismat main ijapha sankshipt samay ke liye tha
 In 1992, there was a sharp decline in sales and the $ 239,000 Diablo proved to be a loss deal for American enthusiasts
 Now that Lamborghini was at a loss, Chrysler decided that the vehicle factory was not producing enough cars according to the investment
