 Later, on Ramachandra Deb establishing an independent kingdom in Khurda, the temple and its idols were restored
 
 According to the traditional legend associated with the origin of this temple, the original idol of Lord Jagannath made of Indranil or Sapphire was found under an Agaru tree
 yah itani chakchaundh karne vaali thi, ki dharm ne ise prithvi ke neeche chupaana chaha
 Malwa King Indradyumna saw this idol in his dream
 tab usne kadi tapasya kii or tab bhagwaan vishnu ne use bataaya ki vah puri ke samudr tat par jaye or use ek daaru kaa laththa milegaa
 He should build the idol with the same wood
 raja ne aisa hi kiya or use lakdi kaa laththa mil bhi gaya
 The king then appeared before him as Vishnu and Vishwakarma carpenter artisan and sculptor
 kintu unhone yah shart rakhi, ki ve ek maah main murti taiyaar kar denge, parantu tab tak vah ek kamare main band rahenge or raja yaa koi bhi us kamare ke andar nahin aaye
 On the last day of the month, when there was no sound for many days, the king eagerly peeped into the room and the old artisan came out by opening the door and told the king that the idols were still incomplete, his hands were not yet made
 raja ke afsos karne par, murtikar ne bataaya, ki yah sab daivavash hua he or yah murtiyon aise hi sthapit hokar puji jaayengin
 Then the idols of the same three Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were installed in the temple
 
 Some historians believe that this temple was formerly a Buddhist stupa in its place
 us stupa main gautam buddha kaa ek daant rakhaa tha
 It was later moved to its present position, Kandy, Sri Lanka

 In his last days, he had also asked that the world famous Kohinoor diamond, now the most valuable and the largest diamond in the world, be donated to this temple
 lekin yah sambhav naa ho sakaa, kyoki us samay tak, british ne punjab par apana adhikaar karke, unki sabhi shahi sampatti jabt kar lee thi
 Otherwise Kohinoor diamond would have been the pride of the crown of Lord Jagannath

 In the Mahabharata, for the residents of Chedi district, the thirteenth chapter of the Adi festival, verses 10-12, reads - "the districts of Chedi are righteous, contented and sane
 yahan haas-parihaas main bhi koi jhooth nahin bolta, phir anya avasaron par to bol hi kaise saktaa he
 The sons are always in the interest of the gurus, the father does not divide them in his life

 His parents wanted him to marry Krishna, but Rukm wanted his sister to be married to Chediraj Shishupala
 atah usne rukmani kaa tikaa shishupal ke yahan bhijwa diya
 Rukmini was enamored with Krishna, so she sent a message to Krishna at the hands of a Brahmin
 krishna ne sandesh laane vaale brahman se kaha, "he brahman devtaa! jaisaa rukmani mujhase prem karti hai vaise hi main bhi unheen se prem karata hoon
 i know that Rukmani's parents want Rukmani to marry me, but his elder brother Rukman is preventing him from doing so because of enmity with me
 tum jaakar rajkumaari rukmani se kah do ki main avashya hi unako byaah kar laungaa
 "krishna married Rukmini, but Chediraj Shishupala considered it an insult and he considered Krishna his enemy

 jab shishupal shri krishna ko ek sau gaali de chukaa tab shri krishna ne garaj kar kaha, "bas shishupal! ab mere vishay main tere mukh se ek bhi apshabd niklaa to tere praan nahin bachenge
 i had pledged to forgive you a hundred abusive words, that is why your life remains till now
 " shri krishna ke in vachanon ko sun kar sabha main upasthit shishupal ke saare samarthak bhay se tharra gayi kintu shishupal kaa vinaash sameep tha, atah usne kaal ke vash hokar apni talwaar nikaalte huye shri krishna ko phir se gaali di
 As soon as the abusive word came out of Shishupala's mouth, Shri Krishna started his Sudarshan Chakra and in the blink of an eye, Shishupala's head fell off

 ye dakshin bharat ke kanchipuram ke raja sugandh ke tritiy putr the
 He made his china-china voyage by sea
 ve china ke dakshini samudri tat kenton bandargah par utre
 It is famous that Lord Buddha was a wonderful meditator
 ve sarvada dhyaan main leen rahete the
 He is said to have transmitted the ultimate knowledge of truth to the Mahakashyapa in a moment and this was the moment of the origin of the meditation community of Buddhism
 mahakashyap se yah gyaan anand main sampreshit hua
 In this way, this knowledge stream continued to flow from the guru-disciple tradition

 Bu-ti, the then king of northern China, desired his visit

 He did many important works for the promotion of Buddhism
 anek stupa, vihaar evam mathon kaa nirmaan karaayaa tha evam sanskrit buddha granthon kaa chini bhashaa main anuwaad karaayaa tha
 At the invitation of the king, Bodhidharma met him in Nan-king
 un donon main nimna prakaar se dharm sanlap hua
 Bu-ti-bhante - i have built many viharas etc
 and translated many Sanskrit texts of Buddhism and allowed many people to become Buddhist monks
 kya in kaaryon se mujhe punya-laabh hua he? Bodhidharma - Not at all
 bu-ti - vaastavik punya kya he? Bodhidharma - pure wisdom, which is zero, subtle, complete and peaceful
 kintu is punya kii prapti sansar main sambhav nahin he
 Boo-ti - Who is the most sacred religion? bodhidharm - jahaan sab shoonyata he, vahaan pavitra kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Boo-ti - Then who is talking in front of me? bodhidharm - main nahin jaanata
 Based on the above mentioned dialogue, Bodhidharma proves to be a person of a rude nature
 unhone samraat ke punya kaaryon kaa anumodan bhi nahin kiya
 He had compassion even when he appeared harsh on the outside
 vastut: unhone raja ko bataaya ki daan dena, vihaar banvaanaa, aadi punya kaary adhik mahatvapurn nahin hai, ve anitya hai
 Thus he saved the emperor from egoism and preached the higher truth of emptiness, which is the past of duality and tragic things like virtue-sin sacred-impure sat-asat etc
 uparyukt bhent ke baad bodhidharm vahaan rahane main koi laabh na dekhakar yaan-tsi-nadi paar karke uttari china ke bei naamak rajya main chale gayi
 After this, most of his time was spent in a vihara called 'shashva-shanti', situated on the shug-shan mountain near Lo-ya, the state capital, which was built in the first half of the fifth century

 pehle vah kunfushiasi dharm kaa anuyaayi tha
 He came to become his disciple after hearing the fame of Bodhidharma
 saat din or saat raat tak darvaaze par khadaa rahaa, kintu bodhidharm ne milane kii anumati nahin thi
 Snow stood up to his knees as he stood in the ground in the winter night, yet the Guru did not grace him
 tab shain-kkang ne talwaar se apni bai baanh kaat daali or use lekar guru ke sameep upasthit hua or bolaa ki use shishyatv nahin mila to vah apane sharir kaa bhi balidaan kar degaa
 Then the Guru paid attention to him and asked what do you want from me? Shan-kkung said, "I want peace of mind
" bodhidharm ne kathortapurvak kaha ki apane man ko nikaal kar mere saamne rakho, main use shant kar doongaa
 Then Shan-kkung cried and said that how can i remove the mind and give it to you? On this, being somewhat humble and compassionate, Bodhidharma said - i have calmed your mind
 tatkaal shain-kkang ko shaanti kaa anubhav hua, uske saare andeh dur ho gaye or bauddhik sangharsh sadaa ke liye mit gaye
 Shan-kkang became the second Dhanayaka of the Dhyan Sampradaya in China

 inke baad duusari bhikshuni shishyaa boli ki satya kaa keval ek baar darshan hota he, phir kabhi nahin, bodhidharm ne kaha ki tumhen meraa maance praapt he
 After this, the third disciple said that the four great powers and the five wings are zero and discrete
 sat rup main grahan karne yogya koi vastu nahin he
 Bodhidharma said that you have got my bones
 ant main hui-ke ne aakar pranaam kiya or kuch bole nahin, chupchaap apane sthaan par khadey rahe
 Bodhidharma told this disciple that you have received my fat
 iske baad hi bodhidharm antardhan ho gaye

 in logon ke kehane par baad main loyang main bodhidharm kii samadhi kholi gai, kintu usamen ek juute ke alaava or kuch na mila
 Some people say that Bodhidharma returned from China and came to India
 japan main kuch logon kaa vishwaas he ki ve china se japan gaye or naaraa ke sameep katayog-yama shahar main ek bhikshuk ke rup main unhen dekha gaya
 Bodhidharma did not write any book, but some of his words or teachings are mentioned in the history texts of the Dhyan Sampradaya
 japan main ek pustak 'shoshitsu ke chah nibandh' naam prachlit he, jisamen unke chah nibandh sangruhit maane jate hai
 In the book of Suzuki, there are definitely some words of Bodhidharma in this book, but not all essays are of Bodhidharma
 china ke tun-huaan nagar ke 'sahastra buddha guha vihaar' ke dhvansaavasheshon main hastlikhit pustakon ko ek sangrah uplabdh hua tha, jisamen ek prati bodhidharm dwaara pradutt pravachanon se sambandhit he
 The questions of the disciple and the answers to Bodhidharma are stored in a fragmented form

 At present, this copy is preserved in the National Library of China

 According to Bodhidharma's ideas, knowledge of reality requires insight into wisdom, which penetrates directly to reality
 iske liye kisi tark yaa anumaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 There is no analysis, no comparative thinking, no thinking about the past and the past, nor any decision to be reached, but everything is to be seen directly
 isamen sankalp-vikalp or shabdon ke liye bhi koi sthaan nahin he
 It only requires 'eating'
 swanubhuti hi iskaa lakshya he, kintu 'swa' kaa arth nity aatma aadi nahin he
 Meditation is a great achievement in Asia

 Therefore, the bodhisattva clearly means the seeker practicing knowledge, true mercy etc
 who is sure to become Buddha later
 bhagwaan buddha bhi na keval apane antim janm main buddhatv-prapti kii avasthaa se purv bodhisattva rahe the, balki apane anek purv janmon main bhi bodhisattva kii charya kaa unhone paalan kiya tha
 The stories of the Jataka are related to these various previous births of Lord Buddha while he was a Bodhisattva
 adhiktar kahaniyon main ve pradhan paatr ke rup main chitrit he
 He himself is the protagonist of the story
 kahin-kahin unka sthaan ek saadhaaran paatr ke rup main gaun he or kahin-kahin ve ek darshak ke rup main bhi chitrit kiye gayi hai
 Often the beginning of each story goes like this: "once upon a time when King Brahmadatta ruled in Varanasi, the Bodhisattvas originated from the vagina of the Kurang deer or 


 the clans of the horses of the Indus cross or the xxrep 5 
 Bodhisattva Brahmadatta's amatya or 

 Bodhisattva was born in the vagina of Goh, etc
 jataka kii kahaniyon main se kuch kaa namakaran to jataka main ai hui gaatha ke pehle shabdon se hua he, yatha-apashnak jataka; kisi kaa pradhan paatr ke anusaar, yatha vannupath jataka; kisi kaa un janmon ke anusaar jo bodhisattva ne grahan kiye yatha, nigredh mig jataka, machh jataka, aadi
 All Jataka stories have been told by Gautam Buddha, Jataka Buddha is time-bound, it is very difficult to decide what is the exact number of people
 lanka, burma or siam main prachlit parampara ke anusaar jataka 550 hai
 Samanatpasadika's Nidan Katha also mentions the same number of natives
 ââpannasa dhakani panchastani jatkanti veditbban
 "in the diagnosis story of Atthasalini also - Pannasadhikani Panchajatakasatani"
 sankhya mote taur par hi nishchit kii gai he
 In the present form of Jataka there are 547 Jataka stories
 par yah sankhya bhi keval upree he
 The Jatakattavanakarika has divided them into five sections in terms of content - jataka kii kai kahaniyaan alp roopaantar ke saath do jagah bhi pai jaati he yaa ek duusare main samavisht bhi kar di gai hai, or isi prakaar kai jataka kathaayen sutt-pitak, vinay-pitak, tathaa anya pali granthon main to pai jaati he, kintu jataka ke vartmaan rup main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, there is also a possibility of a significant decrease in the number of natives and an increase
 udhaahrantah munik jataka or saluk jataka kii kathavstu ek hi si he, kintu keval bhinn-bhinn naamon se vah do jagah ai he
 In contrast, there are two different names, named 'munik Jataka'
 yahi baat machh jataka naam se do jataka kii bhi he
 Somewhere, two independent Jatakas have been merged and a third Jatak has been created
 udhaaharan ke liye panchapandit jataka or dakarkkhas jataka ye donon jataka mahoumagg jataka main antarbhavit hai
 The stories which are found elsewhere in the form of jataka-katha, but are not stored in 'jataka', it will also be necessary to mention something
 majjhim nikaay kaa ghatikaar- sutt yaa ghatikaar sutt ek aisi hi jataka kahani he, jo âjatakaâ main nahin milti
 Similarly, the Mahagovind Sutta of longevity which has been specified by the name of 'mahagovind Jataka' in the Jataka story of the Jataka itself, is not found inside the Jataka
 isi prakaar dhammapadatthkatha or milind panh main bhi kuch aisi jataka-kathaayen uddhrut kii gai hai, jo jataka main sangruhit nahin he
 Therefore, some people definitely cannot decide exactly how many are there
 jab jaatakon kii sankhya ke sambandh main vichaar karte hai to jataka se hamaara taatpary ek vishesh sheershak vaali kahani se hota he, jisamen bodhisattva ke jivan-sambandhi ki si ghatana kaa varnan ho, phir chaahe us ek jataka main kitni hi avaantar kathaayen kyon na goonth di gai hon
 If the total stories are counted then about three thousand stories are found in the native
 vastav main jaatakon kaa sankalan sutt-pitak or vinay-pitak ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 There are many such stories in Sutta-pitaka which have been used to preach there
 kintu bodhisattva kaa ullekh usamen nahin he
 After doing this work, each story has been given the form of a Jataka
 titir jataka or dighit kosal jataka kaa nimarn isi prakaar vinay-pitak ke kramshah chullavagg or mahavagg se kiya gaya he
 Manikanth Jataka is also based on vinaya-pitaka
 isi prakaar deergh-nikaay ke kootadant sutt or mahasudassan sutt tathaa majjhim nikaay ke makhadev sutt bhi puure arthon main jataka hai
 At least 13 Jataka people have been discovered by scholars in Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 yadhyapi rajktha chor-katha evam isi prakaar kii bhay, yuddh, gram, nigam, nagar, janapad, stri, panghat, bhoot-pret aadi sambandhi kathaon ko tirashchin kathaayen kahkar bhikshu sangh main heyata kii drushti se dekha jaataa tha
 Nevertheless, monks used to use stories in some quantity for preaching
 swayan bhagwaan ne bhi upamaaon or drushtaanton ke dwaara dharm kaa upadesh diya he
 In the second variation of the Buddhist Sanskrit text Siddharmapundarika Sutra it is also said that the Buddha teaches with many parables and through the Jataka for the welfare of all beings
 buddha ke alaava anya bhartiya sant bhi upanishdon ke kaal se lekar ramakrishna paramhans ke samay tak aakhyayikaon or drushtaanton ke sahare dharmopadesh karte rahe hai
 The Jataka tales have developed on the basis of this trend
 jan samaaj main prachlit kathaon ko bhi kahi-kahin le liya gaya he, kintu unhen ek nayaa naitik rup de diya gaya he, jo buddha dharm kii ek visheshta he
 Hence Buddhism has its full imprint on all Jataka tales
 purv parampara se chale aate hue lok-aakhyaanon kaa aadhaar unamem ho saktaa he, par unka sampoorn dhaanchaa buddha dharm ke naitik adarsh ke anukool he
 The Buddha Vedas have been classified as nine organs, whose names are- buddha vachanon kaa yah nau prakaar kaa vibhaajan unke style swaroopon yaa namoonon kii drushti se hi he, granthon kii drushti se nahin
 There were so many types of Buddha sermons, this is the meaning of this classification
 buddha vachanon kaa nau angon main vibhaajan jinamein jataka kii sankhya saatvin he, atyant pracheen he
 Hence, Jataka stories are important and necessary parts of Pali literature in Sarvansh
 unki sankhya ke vishay main anischitata visheshtah unke samay-samay par sutt pitak or vinay-pitak tathaa anya shroton se sankalan ke kaaran or swayan pali pitak ke naanaa vargikarnon or unke paraspar sanmishran ke kaaran utpann hui he
 In Chulla Niddes, we find only 500 Jatakas
 chini yatri phahyan ne paanchavi shatabdi isvi main 500 jaatakon ke chitra lanka main ankit hue dekhe the
 Pictures of the natives have been found in the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi before the second third century BC
 jinamein se kam se kam 27 yaa 29 jaatakon ke chitron kii pahchaan rais davids ne kii thi
 Since then some other Jataka stories have also been identified on the stone-vesantis of these stupas
 ye sab tathy jataka kii pracheenta or uske vikaas ke suchak hai
 Jataka tales are also found in texts of Sanskrit Buddhism, like Stalistic Pali literature
 pali ke nawang buddha vachan kii tarah yahan dwaad sha ang dharmapravachan maane gayi hai
 In both of these places the Jataka exists as an organ or part of the discourse
 buddha sanskrit granth jatakamala main jo aryashur kii rachana bataai jaati he 34 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Aryasur is called Lama and Taranath is another name for Ashwaghosh but it does not seem to be right
 sambhavtah ve chaturth shatabdi isvi ke kavi the
 About 80 Jataka tales are found in the famous epic book Mahavastu written between 200 BCE and 400 BCE
 isamen se kuch pali jataka ke samaan hai or ku chha aisi bhi hai, jo pali jataka main nahin pai jaati
 Raees Davids states that the collection and execution of the Jataka took place on the basis of ancient folklore in the middle country
 vinternitj ne bhi praayah isi mat kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 Most of the people are Buddhakalins
 sanchi or bharhut ke s tupon kii pashaan-veshtoniyon par unke drishyon kaa ankit hona unke purv ashokakaleen hone kaa paryaapt sakshya detaa he
 In relation to the time and curiosity of the person, more light will come from discussing his literary form and characteristics
 prayek jataka katha paanch bhaagon main vibhakt he
 Panchuppannavatthu means the present-day event or story
 buddha ke jivan kaal main jo ghatana ghati vah pacchuppannavatthu he
 That incident gave God the opportunity to say the story of a previous birth
 yah purvajanm kaa vrutt hi atitvatthu he
 The most important part of the story of each person is the past
 isi ke anukool pacchppannavatthu kahin-kahin garh lee gai prathit hoti he
 The past is followed by one or more verses
 inkaa sambandh vaise to atitvatthu se hi hota he, kintu kahin-kahin pacchppannavatthu se bhi hota he
 Gathas are the oldest parts of the native
 vastav main gaathaayen hi jataka hai
 The Jataka, who is composed of five parts, such as Pachchuppannavathu, is actually Jatakattavavana or Jataka comes to Vyayakaran or Athavana
 isamen gaathaon kii vyakhya or unka shabdaarth hota he
 At the last comes a solstice, in which the characters of the past is linked with the characters of the Buddha's life time, as at that time the hunter who hunted from the attic was the present-day Dev Dutt and the Kurung deer was me, etc
 
 jataka main buddha ke purv janmon kii kathaayen sangruhit he jabaki unhone bodhisattva ke rup main vibhinn parmitaayen puri kin or buddhatv ke liye yogyata sampadit kii
 In the first four bodies of the sutta-pitaka, the historical form of the Buddha is reputed
 baad main jataka main unke aitihaasik jivan ko purv kii kathaon se sambaddh kar diya pate hai
 Jatakathakatha's Nidan Katha tells about three Nidas of Buddha life, Dure Nidan is the story of Buddha life from very distant past, it is believed that Buddha Sumedha was born as an ascetic in a very remote past
 us samay unhone deepankar buddha main badi nishtha dikhaai jiske parinamswaroop unhone unhen aage chalakar buddha hone kaa aashirwad diya
 The cultivation of the sume and ascetic continued while holding various bodies for many births
 ant main vessantar raja ke rup main sharir tyaag kar ve tushit lok main gayi
 From the form of Sumedha ascetic to the passage to the well-to-do, this cult of Buddha is under distant diagnosis
 547 jataka kathaayen apannak jataka se lekar vessantar jataka tak buddha jeevani ke is duure nidaan se hi sambandhit he
 These stories here mean the past story mentioned in them
 inkaa sambandh buddha kii jivan-katha ke duure nidaan se he arthath ye bahut dur ateet kii kathaayen hai
 From the time of being born in Lumbini forest to the attainment of Bodhi, the story is related to the unhealthy diagnosis
 arthath vah itane dur ateet kii nahin he
 From the attainment of Bodhi to attainment of Nirvana, the Buddha biography is under the diagnosis of Santi
 arthath vah sameep kii he
 Some parts of it come in the form of preface in Jataka's Pachuppannavatthu
 jataka kii kahaniyon main atitvatth main buddha jeevani ke duure nidaan ke andar samavisht unke purv janmon kii kahaniyaan aati he
 a holiday has been taken to tell the stories of these two nidanas by mentioning an event in the life of the historical Buddha
 jo ho vastav main jataka kaa nirmaan karti he
 It is clear from the above discussion of the five parts of each Jataka that the Jataka are prose-verse mixed compositions
 gaatha bhaag jataka kaa pracheenatam bhaag mana jaataa he
 It would be more appropriate to consider this saga part under Tripitaka
 shesh sab atthkatha he
 But the nature of the Jataka tales is such that nothing can be understood by separating the original from the interpretation
 keval gaathaayen kahani kaa nirmaan nahin karti
 When the events of the present and past are put on them, only the plot is created
 atah puure jataka main uparyukt paanch avyavon kaa haana aavashyak he jisamen gaatha-bhaag ko chhodkar shesh sab uski vyakhya he baad kaa joda hua he
 Yet for convenience and historically wrongly, we call it Jataka
 vastav main 547 jataka kathaon ke sangrah ko jo uparyukt paanch angon se samanvit he, hamen jataka na kahkar jatakatthawannana yaa jatakatthakatha hi kahana chahie
 Fosbal and Koval, which have been edited and translated in Roman script and in English respectively, or Bhadant Anand Kausalayan in Hindi, have been translated into 6 parts under the title 'jataka', that is actually the interpretation of Jataka rather than Jataka
 jataka kathaayen to mul rup main keval gaathaayen he, shesh bhaag uski vyakhya he
 The question arises as to what is the relationship between the saga and the remaining part of the native in terms of chronology etc
 atathkatha main gaatha-bhaag ko abhisambuddha gaatha yaa bhagavan buddha dwaara bhashit gaathaayen kaha gaya he
 They are Buddhist
 atah ve tipitak ke angabhoot thi or unakon vahaan se sankalit kar unke upar kathaon kaa dhaanchaa prastut kiya gaya he
 On the basis of the classification of the contents of the entire Jataka text, it is also clear that the saga-part, or what the scholars like Pinternnitz, called saga-jataka, is its base
 jataka granth kaa vargeekaran vishay-vastu ke aadhaar par na hokar gaathaon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par hua he
 Like the ther-theri saga, he is also divided into the Nittpas
 jataka main 22 nipaat hai
 There are 150 such stories in the first Nipta, in which a saga of one is found
 duusare nipaat main bhi 150 jataka kathaayen he kintu yahan prayek katha main do-do gaathaayen pai jaati hai
 Similarly, there are fifty-fifty stories in the third and fourth nipatas and the number of gathas is three-three and four-four respectively
 aage bhi terahaven nipaat tak praayah yahi kram chalata he
 The name of the fourteenth fall is Pakinak Nipat
 is nipaat main gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar vividh he
 Hence it has been named Pakinnak
 is nipaat main kuch kathaon main 10 gaathaayen bhi pai jaati he or kuch main 47 tak bhi pai jaati he
 The number of gathas has steadily increased in the future
 pandrahaven nipaat kaa sheershak he vis nipaat, solahaven kaa tins nipaat, satrahawein kaa chattalis nipaat, attharahawein kaa pannas nipaat ,unnisven kaa saththi nipaat, biswein kaa sattatinipat or ikkisven kaa asitinipat
 There are only ten Jataka tales in the bison nipat, but the number of gathas in each is above a hundred
 antik jataka main to gaathaon kii sankhya saat sau se bhi upar he
 All of this leads to the conclusion that the Jataka is the basis of stories
 swayan anek jataka kathaon ke veyyakaran bhaag main pali or atthkatha ke bich bhed dikhaaya gaya he, jaise ki pali sutton kii anya anek atthakathaon tathaa visuddhimaggon aadi granthon main bhi
 As far as the appropriation part of the native is concerned, there can be only the meaning of Pali, the last story
 bhashaa ke sakshya se bhi gaatha bhaag adhik pracheenta kaa dyotak he apekshaakrit gadhy bhaag ke
 Pinternitz has said that the entire saga of the native cannot be considered as the original part of the Tipitaka
 unamem bhi purvapar bhed he
 This is clear from the classification of the native himself
 chaudaaven nipaat main prayek jataka katha kii gaathaon kii sankhya niyamanusaar 14 na hokar kahi-kahin bahut adhik he
 Similarly, in the twentieth fall, the number of his two Jataka stories is 92 and 93 respectively, not seventy-seventy
 is sabase yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya he ki jataka kaa gaathaon athwa gaatha jataka kii mul sankhya nipaat ke sheershak kii sankhya ke anukool hi hogi
 And later it has been augmented
 atah kuch gaatha en adhik pracheen he or kuch apekshaakrit kam pracheen he
 Similarly, the prose section also has some very ancient features and some are relatively ancient
 kisi-kisi jataka main gadhy or gaatha bhaag main samya bhi nahin dikhaai padataa or kahi-kahin style main bhi badi vibhinnata he
 This highlights the computational form and diversity of its linguistic form, with many composers or compilers and the sum of many centuries
 jataka kii gaathaon kii pracheenta to nirvivaad he hi, uskaa adhikansh gadhy bhaag bhi atyant pracheen he
 The pictures inscribed on the stone veins of the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi are related to the prose part of the native
 atah jataka kaa adhikansh gadhy-bhaag jo pracheen he, tritiy, dwitiya shatabdi isvi purv main itnaa lokapriy to hona hin chahie ki use shilp kala kaa aadhaar banaaya ja sake
 Therefore, generally, we can consider the Jataka as a symbol of the Indian society and culture of Buddha
 usamen kuch lakshan or avasthaaon ke chithran praha-buddhakalin bharat ke bhi hai or kuch buddha ke kaal ke baad ke bhi he
 As far as the interpretation and interpretation of the saga is concerned, it is probably the oldest part of the native
 is ansh ke lekhak acharya buddha ghosh maane jate he
 According to 'gandhavans', Acharya Buddhaghosha composed 'jataktatthanna', but it is relevant

 But his literary form has also flourished

 Many types of descriptive narratives are filled in the Jataka, whose literary characteristics cannot be mentioned here in very brief form
 buddhakalin bharat ke samaaj, dharm, raajnneeti, bhugol, loukik vishwaas, aarthik evam vyapaarik avasthaa evam sarvaadhik jivan kii puri saamagree hamen jataka main milti he
 The Jatakas are not just the oldest collection of folk tales
 buddha sahitya main to uskaa sthaan sarvamaanya he hi

 buddha sahitya ke samaan samgr bhartiya-sahitya main or itnaa hi nahin, samgr vishwa-sahitya main jataka kaa ek mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Similarly, he is not only an illustrator of an era of Indian civilization, but a wonderful saga of its spread is also accommodated in the Jataka

 The Jataka is an excellent means to know the socio-economic and political life of Buddha India

 It is found naturally on the earth
 dharti ke vayumandal main yah gas aaytan ke hisaab se lagbhag 0
03 pratishat hoti he
 Carbon dioxide is composed of two atoms of oxygen and one atom of carbon
 saamaanya taapmaana tathaa dabaav par yah gasiy avasthaa main rahati he
 This gas is found to be 0
03% to 0
04% in the atmosphere, but its concentration in the air also changes slightly as the weather changes
 yah ek greenhouse gas he, kyonki surya se aane vaali kirnon ko to yah prithvi ke dharaatal par pahunchane detii he parantu prithvi kii garmi jab waapas antariksh main janaa chaahati he to yah use rokatii he
 All living organisms on Earth give up carbon dioxide in their respiration
 jabaki hare ped-paudhe prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya karte samay is gas ko grahan karke carbohydrate kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Thus, carbon dioxide is a major component of the carbon cycle
 carbon ke rasinic yogicon ko carbonic yogic kehete hai
 Their number in nature is more than 1 million
 jivan paddati main carbonic yogicon kii bahut hi mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 These contain carbon as well as hydrogen
 aitihaasik tathaa parampara gat kaarnon se kuch carbon ke yogakon ko carbonic yogicon kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 These mainly include carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
 sabhi jaev anu jaise carbohydrate, amino amla, protein, arene tathaa diene carbonic yogic hi hai
 Compounds of carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons
 methen sabase chote anusutra kaa hydrocarbon he
 Ethane, propane, etc
 are followed by which one carbon is added respectively
 hydrocarbon teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai: ethane shrenee, ethilin shrenee or asitilin shrenee
 Ethane-grade hydrocarbons are saturated, ie, the amount of hydrogen in them cannot be increased further
 ethilin main do carbonon ke bich main ek dwibandh he, asitilin main trigun bandha vaale yogic asthaayee hai
 It can easily get oxidised and halogenated
 hydrocarbonon ke bahut se vyutpann taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai, jinke vividh upyog hai
 Such derivatives are chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohol, sodium alkoxide, amine, mercaptan, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate, and hydrogen sulfate
 asatrupt hydrocarbon adhik sakriy hota he or anek abhikaarakon se sanyukt ha saralata se vyutpann banaata he
 Many such derivatives have proved to be of great importance from an industrial point of view
 inase anek bahumoolya vilaayak, plastic, kriminashak oshadhiyaan aadi praapt hui hai
 The oxidation of hydrocarbons gives alcohol ether, ketones, aldehydes, fatty acids, esters, etc
 alcodaul praathmik, dwitiyak or tritiyak ho sakate hai
 Their ester fluids are aromatic

 aa Jainism celebrates Paryushan in Bhadrapada month
 shwetambar sampradaay ke paryushan 8 din chalate hai
 The Digambara sect then observe Paryusana for 10 days
 unhen ve 'dasalakshan' ke naam se bhi sambodhit karte hai
 The Jain text, Tattvartha Sutra, describes 10 religions
 yah 10 dharm he: These ten religions are worn on the festival of rituals
 yah sab chijen nashvanth he yah sab chijen ek din aap ko chod dengi yaa phir aapako ek din jabaran in chizon ko chhodna hi padega 
nashvanth chizon ke pichhe bhaagane se behatar he ki abhimaan or parigrah sab bure kam main badhotari karte he jinako chhoda jaye or sab se vinamr bhav se pesh aae sab jivo ke prati maitri bhav rakhe kyonki sabhi jivo ko jivan jine kaa adhikaar he 
 Everyone has to go one day or the other, then it is better to renounce all sanctions and it is better to recognize yourself and meditate to destroy the sanctions, meditate with sacrifice and throw it into the hearth, because to save them and to save eternal peace Spiritual practice is the only option
 aatma gyaan, khushi, prayaas, vishwaas jaise asankhya guno se sinchit he us main itani takat he ki keval gyaan ko praapt kar sake
 uttam aajav dharm hamen sikhaata he ki moh-maaya, bure kam sab chod chad kar saral swabhaav ke saath param anand moksh praapt kar sakate hai 
 The best defecation teaches us that be happy in what you have got from a pure mind, it is possible to attain the ultimate bliss of salvation only by thanking God and making your soul pure
 uttam satya dham hame yahi sikhaata he ki aatma kii prakruti jaanane ke liye satya aavashyak he or iske aadhaar par hi param anand moksh ko praapt karnaa mumkin he 
 apane man aatma ko saral or shuddh bana len to satya apane aap hi aa jayega 
 Like dislike in sab se chhutkaaraa tab hi mumkin he jab apni aatma ko in sab pralobhanon se mukt kare or sthir man ke saath sanyam rakhen 
 isi raah par chalate param anand moksh kii prapti mumkin he 
 It is probably not possible in this era to do penance like our Tirthankaras, but we also have the same sentiment and during the 10 days of Paryushan Pav, we do fasting, meditation and try to walk the path of attaining ultimate bliss salvation
 chhodne kii bhaavana jain dharm main sabase adhik he kyonki jain sant sif gharbaar nahin yahaan tak ki apane kapadey bhi tyaag detaa he or puraa jivan digambar mudra dhaaran karke vyatit karata he 
insaan kii shakti isse nahin parkhi jaati kii uske paas kitni dhan daulat he balki isse parkhi jaati he ki usne kitna chhoda kitna tyaag kiya he ! It is possible to achieve the ultimate bliss salvation by leaving all temptations and attachments
 jaise jameen par sona na ki gadde takiyon par, zarurat se zyada kisi vastu kaa upyog na karnaa, vyay, moh, vaasana naa rakhte saadagi se jivan vyatit karnaa 
koi bhi sant iska paalan karte he or visheshkar jainsnt sharir, jubaan or dimag se sabase zyada iskaa hi paalan karte hai 
 By following Brahmacharya, you will gain the knowledge and power of the whole universe, and in doing so, you are just a slave to your desires and desires

 The basic purpose of celebrating Paryushan festival is to focus on the undertakings required to make the soul pure
 paryaavaran kaa shodhan iske liye vaanchhneeya mana jaataa he
 It is not possible to give the soul a pure form without making it neutral or detached to the environment
 is drushti se'kalpasutra' yaa tatwarth sutara kaa vaachan or vivechan kiya jaataa he or sant-muniyon or vidwaanon ke saannnidhya main swadhyay kiya jaataa he
