 Bahadur Shah Zafar was the last emperor of the Mughal Empire in India and a noted poet of Urdu
 unhone 1857 kaa pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main bhartiya sipaahiyon kaa netritv kiya
 After the defeat in the war, the British sent him to Burma where he died
 jafar kaa janm 24 aktubar, 1775 main hua tha
 His father was Akbar Shah II and mother Lalbai
 apane pita kii mrityu ke baad jafar ko 18 sitambar, 1837 main mughal badshaah banaaya gaya
 It was a matter of fact that by that time the Sultanate of Delhi had become very weak and the Mughal emperor had remained a nominal emperor
 bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii jafar ko baari keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 His sons and great-grandchildren were publicly roasted by the British authorities
 yahi nahin, unhen bandi banaakar rangoon le jaaya gaya, jahaan unhone saat november, 1862 main ek bandi ke rup main dam todaa
 He was buried near the Shvedagon Pagoda in Rangoon
 unke dafan sthal ko ab bahadur shah jafar dargah ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Even today, when a patriotic person travels to the then Burma, he does not forget to pay tribute to Zafar's tomb
 logon ke dil main unke liye kitna sammaan tha uskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki hindustan main jahaan kai jagah sadakon kaa naam unke naam par rakhaa gaya he, vahiin pakistan ke lahore shahar main bhi unke naam par ek sadak kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 Victoria Park in Old Dhaka city of Bangladesh has been renamed Bahadur Shah Zafar Park
 1857 main jab hindustan kii aazaadee kii chingaari bhadki to sabhi vidrohi sainikon or raja-maharaajaaon ne unhen hindustan kaa samraat mana or unke netritv main angrejon kii eent se eent baja di
 Bahadur Shah Zafar also got angry after seeing the rebellion of Indian soldiers against the British and called for the British to be driven out of India
 bharatiyon ne dilli or desh ke anya hisson main angrejon ko kadi shikast di
 Initial results favored the Indian warriors, but later, due to the deception of the British, the stand of the first freedom struggle changed and the British managed to suppress the rebellion
 bahadur shah jafar ne humayun ke makbare main sharan lee, lekin major hads ne unhen unke bete mirza mughal or khijar sultan va pote abu bakar ke saath pakad liya
 The British crossed all limits of oppression
 jab bahadur shah jafar ko bhukh lagi to angrej unke saamne thali main paroskar unke beton ke sir le aae
 He replied to the British that the sons of India sacrifice their heads for the country and come to their father in the same manner
 aazaadee ke liye hui baghawat ko puri tarah khatm karne ke makasad se angrejon ne antim mughal badshaah ko desh se nirvasit kar rangoon bhej diya
 Bahadur Shah Zafar was not only a patriotic Mughal emperor but also a famous Urdu poet
 unhone bahut si mashhoor urdu kavitaayen likhin, jinamein se kaaphi angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat ke samay machi uthal-puthal ke dauraan kho gai yaa nasht ho gai
 The lines written by him in Urdu are also very famous - ,,, Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
 ,,, desh se baahar rangoon main bhi unki urdu kavitaaon kaa jalawaa jari rahaa
 He was always worried about India there
 unki antim ichha thi ki vah apane jivan kii antim saans hindustan main hi len or vahiin unhen dafnaaya jaae lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 i do not think that my desolation is in love, what is made of alam-e-naapidar bulbul ko bagbaan se na saiyaad se gilaa,kismat main kaid likhi thi fasal-e-bahaar main
 Tell them to settle somewhere else from these haunts, where is this place in dil-e-daagdar
 ek shaakh gul pe baith ke bulbul he shaadamaan,kaante bicha die hai dil-e-laal-e-zaar main
 Age-a-drawer had brought four days of demand, two were cut in the beginning, two were waiting
 din zindagi khatm hue shaam ho gai,failaa ke paanv soyenge kunj-e-mazaar main
 How much is it for unfortunate 'zafar' dafn, two gaz zameen not found in ku-e-yaar bahadur shah jafar jaise kam hi shaasha hote hai jo apane desh ko mahabuuba kii tarah mohabbat karte hai or ku-e-yaar main jagah na mil paane kii kasak ke saath pardes main dam tod dete hai
 This was the basic difference with the fundamental Indian ideology which considers its country as its mother
 badshaah jafar ne jab rangoon main karawas ke dauraan apni aakhri saans lee to shaayad unke labon par apni hi mashhoor ghazal kaa yah sher jarur rahaa hoga- "kitna he badanaseeb jafar dafn ke liye, do gaj jameen bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 " bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale antim mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar urdu ke ek bade shaayar ke rup main bhi vikhyath hai
 His poetry was filled with patriotism rather than sentimental poets and this was the reason that he warned the British rulers to walk to Shamsheer of Hindustan till the planks-london
 janashrutiyon ke anusaar pratham swatantraaa sangram ke baad jab badshaah jafar ko giraftaar kiya gaya to urdu jaanane vaale ek angrej sainya adhikari ne un par kataaksh karte hue yah sher kaha- "dam main dam nahin, ab khayr maango jaan kii e jafar ab myaan ho chuki he, shamsheer hindustan kii

!!" is par jafar ne karaara jawaab dete hue kaha tha- "hindio main bu rahegi jab talak imaan kii, takhte landan tak chalegi teg hindustan kii

!!" Zafar, called the last emperor of the Mughal period in India, was made the emperor of Delhi during the First War of Independence
 badshaah banate hi unhone jo chand aadesh die, unamem se ek tha gohatya par roak lagaana
 This order shows how big he was for hindu-muslim unity
 gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay main itihaas ke purv praadhyaapak dow shailanath chaturvedi ke anusaar 1857 ke samay bahadur shah jafar ek aisi badi hasti the, jinka badshaah ke taur par hi nahin ek dharmanirpeksh vyakti ke rup main bhi sabhi sammaan karte the
 That is why it was very natural that the soldiers who reached Delhi after revolting from Meerut made Bahadur Shah Zafar their king first
 chaturvedi ne baatcheet main kaha ki jafar ko badshaah bananaa sankethik rup se british shaskaon ko ek sandesh tha
 Under this, the Indian soldiers wanted to give the message that the Indian ruler would be in power at the center of India, not foreign
 badshaah banane ke baad bahadur shah jafar ne gohatya par pabandi kaa jo aadesh diya tha vah koi nayaa aadesh nahin tha
 Rather, Akbar had given similar orders during his reign
 jafar ne mahaj is aadesh kaa paalan phir se karwaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Another aspect of Zafar's personality was poetry, along with Deshprem
 unhone na keval gaalib, daag, momin or jock jaise urdu ke bade shaayaron ko tamaam tarah se protsaahan diya, balki vah swayan ek achche shaayar the
 According to literary critics, during the time of Zafar, where Mughal power was in decline, Urdu literature especially Urdu poetry was at its height
 jafar kii maut ke baad unki shaayari "kulliyaat e jafar" ke naam se sankalit kii gayi

 catholic dharm yaa roman catholic dharm isai dharm kii ek mukhya shakha he jiske anuyaayi rome ke vatican nagar main sthit pope ko apana dharmadhyaksh maanate hai
 The second main branch of Christianity is called the Protestant and its followers do not accept the religious leadership of the Pope
 catholicon or protestanton kii dharmik manyataon main or bhi bade antar hai
 The Roman Catholic Church Jesus established a church for the teaching initiation of his future followers and appointed Saint Peter as its president
 sant peter kaa dehanth rome main hua tha jisase prarambh hi se rome ke bishap ko carch kaa paramadhyaksh mana jane laga
 The unity of this church could not remain intact due to many reasons
 pehle praachya carch rome se alag ho gaye
 Later Protestant religion emerged which resulted in the denial of the authority of the Bishop of Rome by a significant portion of the Western Church
 yah sab hote hue bhi aajkal vishwa bhar ke isaayiyon ke aadhe se kuch adhik log roman katholic carch ke sadsy hai
 This church is called Roman because it operates from the Vatican city of Rome
 katholic kaa mul arth vyapak he
 The Catholic Church claims that it is open to the people of "all countries" until the epoch, that is, "all the time" and teaches "all" religious truths revealed by Jesus
 katholic carch kaa sanghathan sudrudh or kendribhoot he
 Its priest is the bishop of Rome who is considered the successor of Saint Peter
 
 Wherever there is a community of Catholic Christians, a bishop is appointed by Rome or with Rome's approval for their spiritual conduct
 bishap kii adheenta main purohit vibhinn sthanon par rahakar isaayiyon ko upadesh diya karte hai or sanskaar pradaan karte hai
 There are several standing committees and commissions in Rome that assist the pope for the operation and administration of the entire Roman Catholic Church, headed by cardinals
 catholic dharm ko angrezi main "caseolicysm" bulaayaa jaataa he
 Note the pronunciation of 'TH' in it and the amount of 'AU' on it
 angrezi main sangathit catholic dharm ko "catholic carch" bhi bulaayaa jaataa he
 It is noteworthy that although the word "church" means "church", "catholic Church" also means "entire Catholic religious community"
 catholic maanate hai ki unka dharmik sanghathan aarambhik isai sanghathan ke rivaayat ko jari rakhata he or uskaa ekmaatr vaaris he
 They believe that the bread and wine that is drunk in their prayer rituals become the mass and blood of Jesus Christ in a religious sense, which are prayed to by those who pray
 protestanton kii ritiyon main aisa nahin hota
 Catholics consider the Pope to be the ultimate president of Christianity on earth, who is not a Protestant
 is dharmik sanghathan main har padri ke upar ek us se ucch koti kaa padri hota he or ant main sabhi ke upar pope hota he
 In Catholicism, priests are not allowed to marry and have to practice lifelong celibacy
 kuch striyaan bhi apana jivan dharm ke naam kar detii hai or aaajeevan kunwari rahati hai
 These are called "nuns"
 jab yah nan banane kii shapath letin hai to ek aupchaarik samaaroh main vivaah ke vastra dhaaran kiye inkaa "isa se vivaah" rachaaya jaataa he
 Often these nuns are teachers in schools run by Catholic organizations
 catholic dharm main kuch bhakton ko aupchaarik rup se santon kaa darja diya jaataa he or catholicon ko anumati he ki ve inaki puja kar saken
 In many Catholic countries, a local Catholic saint is considered very valid, such as "saint Patrick" in Ireland and "saint Stanislaus" in Poland
 inhen un rashtron kaa "paalak sant" kaha jaataa he
 Mary is considered a very revered saint in the Catholic faith
 catholic striyon main "meri", "maaria" or "mariyam" jaise naam aam hai or catholic vidyalayon main "saint meri" jaise naam bhi aksar dekhe jate hai
 The Latin-language eulogy called "ave Maria" is quite popular in Catholic communities
 catholic nazariye main aisi dharmik hastiyon ko kari puja ishwar ko praapt hoti hai or is se dharm aam janata ke sameep aata he
 The Protestant view is contrasted with this, and saintly practice is often considered a hidden form of Europe's ancient non-christian customs in which there were many deities

mrutyu- 16 june 1911 Coral reefs or coral reefs are rocks within the ocean composed of calcium carbonate released by corals
 vastutah ye in chote jeevon kii bastiyaan hoti hai
 The coral-rock-ranges, generally located in the warm and shallow seas, especially in the Pacific Ocean, are found abundantly in the proximity of many warm or subtropical islands

 These gorgeous rock chains of calcium carbonate are formed by breeding eggs or mucus in the corals, with many millennia coral colonies forming these great-sized rocks
 polip samudr jal se ghule hue calcium ko lekar apane sharir ke chaaron pyaale ke rup main calcium carbonate kaa sravan karte hai
 It is through these polyps that the coral drain is formed
 jyon jyon pravaal nivahon kaa vistaar hota jaataa he, unki urshvamukhi vruddhi hoti rahati he
 Older corals die, the calcareous skeletons of these dying corals, which grow to other future offspring, are buried below

 The depth and temperature of the ocean has a great impact on the bed of the coral ranges, as the rock-forming organisms can survive only in places where the water is clear, shallow and warm
 pravaal ke liye 200 sein

 According to the position and size, they are classified into the following three categories: tateey pravalbhitiyaan : samudratat par pai jaati hai or manch ke rup main jowar ke samay dikh padati hai
 Coral reefs: This type of rock reef is found slightly off the coast, leaving shallow lagoons between these and the coast

 Many volcanic islands found in the Pacific Ocean are surrounded by these types of reefs
 adal yaa pravaal-dweep-valay : un vartuk kaariya bhittiyon ko adal kehete hai jinke madhya main dweep kii apane lagoon hota he
 Generally these rock reefs are discontinuous, which can be moved from open spaces inside the lagoon

 mim, ek vichaar, vyavhaar, yaa style he jo kisi samskruti ke bheetar ek vyakti se duusare vyakti ko antarit hota he
 While a gene transmits biological information, a mim acts to transmit information about ideas and beliefs
 mim ek saidhantik ikai he jo saanskrithik vichaaron, pratikon yaa manyataon aadi ko lekhan, bhaashan, rivaajon yaa anya kisi anukaran yogya ghatana ke madhyam se ek mastishk se duusare mastishk main pahanchaane kaa kaam karti he
 Proponents of the concept of meem consider these to be the cultural equivalent of genetic unit genes, which replicate themselves, mutate and react against selective pressures
 "mim" shabd pracheen unani shabd μίμημα; mimema kaa sankshipt rup he jiskaa arth hindi main nakal karnaa yaa nakal utaarna hota he
 The credit for coining the term and using it for the first time goes to the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who used it in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene
 is shabd ko jin shabd ko aadhaar bana kar gadha gaya tha or is shabd ko ek avadharana ke rup main prayog kar unhone vichaaron or saanskrithik ghatnaon ke prasar ko vikasvaadi siddhanton ke jariye samajhane kii koshish kii thi
 The book includes lyrics, phrases, fashion, and technology of arches as examples of meam
 mim ke vichaar ke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki mim jaivik vikaas ke anuroop, prakritik chayan dwaara viksit ho saktaa he
 Mims do this through the process of differentiation, mutation, competition and inheritance, each of which affects the reproductive success of a mime
 mim apane poshak ke vyavhaar ke madhyam se failte he jise wo swayan apane poshak main utpann karte hai
 Less behaved mimes go extinct, while others may escape, transmit, and mutate
 jo mim swayan kii pratikruti bana sakate hai is daud main safal rahete hai
 Some mimes are successful in replicating themselves effectively, while doing so may prove detrimental to their nutritional well-being
 meemon ke adhyayan ke kshetra ko mematics kaha jaataa he jisaki shuruyaat 1990 ke dashak main ek vikasvaadi model ke sandarbh main avadharanaon or meemon ke sancharan kaa pataa lagane ke liye hui thi
 Various critics have challenged the notion that mims can be empirically tested
 tathaapi neuroimaging main hua vikaas anubhavjanya adhyayan ko sambhav bana saktaa he
 Famine is a widespread lack of food that can be applied to any animal species
 is ghatana ke saath yaa iske baad aam taur par kshetreey kuposhan, bhukhmaree, mahamari or mrityu dar main vruddhi ho jaati he
 When there is little or no rainfall in a region for a long time, it is called drought or famine
 sookhe ke kaaran prabhavit kshetra kii krishi evam vahaan ke paryaavaran par atyant pratikul prabhaav padataa he
 This shakes the local economy
 itihaas main kuch akaal bahut hi kukhyat rahe hai jisamen karondon logon kii jane gayin hai
 Emergency measures for famine relief mainly include compensating micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals that are given through fortified chassis powders or directly through supplements
 sahaayta samoohon ne daata deshon se khaadya padaarth kharidne kii bajaay sthaneey kisaanon ko bhugtan ke liye nagad raashi dena yaa bhukhon ko nagad vauchar dene par aadhaarit akaal raahat model kaa prayog karnaa shuru kar diya he kyonki daata desh sthaneey khaadya padaarth bazaaron ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Long-term measures include investment in modern agricultural techniques such as fertilizer and irrigation, which have largely eradicated starvation in the developed world
 vishwa bank kii baadhyataaen kisaanon ke liye sarkari anudaanon ko simit karte hai or urvarkon ke adhik se adhik upyog ke anapekshit parinaamon: jal aapurtiyon or awaas par pratikul prabhaavon ke kaaran kuch paryaavaran samoohon dwaara iskaa virodh kiya jaataa he
 Definitions of famine are based on three different categories - on the basis of food supply, on the basis of food consumption and on the basis of mortality
 Some definitions of famine are: kisi aabaadi main khaadya padaarthon kii kami yaa to bhojan kii kami yaa phir bhojan ke vitaran main kathinaaiyon ke kaaran hota he; yah sthiti prakritik jalwaayu ke utaar-chadhaavon or damankaaree sarkaar yaa yuddh se sambandhit charam raajnneetik paristhitiyon ke kaaran or bhi badtar ho sakati he
 Ireland's horrific famine was proportionally one of the largest historical famines
 isaki shuruyaat 1845 main aalu kii beemaari kii vajah se hui thi or yah isliye bhi hua kyonki khaadya padaarthon ko ireland se england bheja ja rahaa tha
 Only the British were able to pay the higher prices
 haal hi main itihaaskaaron ne apane un aakalnon ko sanshodhit kiya he jiske anusaar yah bataaya gaya tha ki akaal ko kam karne main angrejon dwaara kitna adhik niyantran kaa prayaas kiya ja saktaa tha, isamen yah paaya gaya ki aam taur par jitna samajha jaataa tha unhone usase kahin adhik madad karne kii koshish kii thi
 The traditional explanation for the cause of famine until 1981 was as a hypothesis of decreased availability of food
 dharna yah thi ki sabhi akalon kii kendriya vajah khaadya padaarthon kii uplabdhta main kami thi
 However the FAD could not explain why only a particular segment of the population such as agricultural laborers were affected by famine while others were untouched by famine
 haal hi ke kuch akalon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par ebedy kii nirnaayak bhoomika par sawaal uthaaya gaya he or yah suzav diya gaya he ki jald se jald bhukhmaree kii sthiti laane kaa kaaran banane vaali pranaaliyon main sirf khaadya padaarthon kii uplabdhta main kami ke alaava bhi kai anya kaarak shaamil hai
 According to this view, famine is a consequence of rights, this proposed principle is called "failure of exchange rights" or FEE
 kisi vyakti ke paas vibhinn prakaar kii vasteen ho sakati hai jinaki adla-badali ek bazaar vyavastha main uski jarurat kii anya chizon ke badalen main kii ja sakati he
 Exchange can be done through trade or production or a combination of both
 in adhikaron ko vyapaar-aadhaarit yaa utpaadan-aadhaarit adhikaar kaha jaataa he
 According to this proposed approach, the state of famine comes due to the loss of ability of the person to exchange his rights
 epaii ke kaaran hone vaale akalon kaa ek udhaaharan kisi khetihar majdoor dwaara apane pramukh adhikaron kaa aadan-pradaan karne kii aakshamata he, jaise ki chaaval kaa majdoor jab uske rojgaar kii sthiti dawandol yaa puri tarah se samaapt ho jaati he
 Some elements make a particular area highly susceptible to famine
 inamen shaamil hai: In some cases, such as the Great Leap Forward in China, in North Korea in the mid-1990s or in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s, famine conditions may arise as an unintended consequence of government policies

 abhigyanshakuntal main pratik – yojana
 
 vasantkumar m
 bhattanideshak, bhashasahityabhavan, gujarat university, ahmadawad – 380 009 0 - 1 Role: Poets have seen the reflection of human sensations and nature in many substances of the universe, so they appropriate it as a symbol and do new-poetry poetry
 kaavyon main nisarg-vyaapt padaarthon kii vishishtatya boonavat karne se maanviya samvednaaon ko acchhee tarah se vaachaa di jaati he, yah sabhi kavion ne janaa he
 But it seems that Kalidasa's philosophy in this subject is somewhat deep
 kalidas kii drushti main, is brahmand main manushya or prakruti jaise do pruthak pruthak astitv nahin he
 For Kalidas, man is also an ineligible part of nature
 is liye abhigyanshakuntal main maanviya prem ke aalekhan main prakruti na keval maanviya samvednaaon ko uddipit karti he, yaa na keval maanviya samvednaaon kaa pratibimb grahan karti he, kintu vah maanviya prem-prasango main aparoksh sahabhaagita bhi dikhaati he
 All the various animals, birds and flowers of nature have been appropriated from the beginning to the end in the theatrical presentation presented, they are all integral parts of the play's character
 lekin abhigyanshakuntal main harin, hans or kamalaadi kaa pratikon ke rup main bhi viniyog hua he
 Therefore, it is desired to have a complete overview of Abhigyanashkuntal's symbol scheme and the theatrical work expressed by them
 
 0 - 3 What is the predetermined speed of this play before beginning the discussion of the various symbols used in the Abhigyanasakuntal play of Mahakavi Kalidasa? This is also known
 saamanytah sabhi sahruday pathak jaanate hi he ki dushyant ko chakravarti putr kii prapti hona hi is naatak kaa charam lakshya he
 But, in the first issue, Kalidas has also directed other modes of play in the other two contexts
 atah kavi-nirdisht kul trividh gati-nirdeshon ke saath shakuntala ke liye prayukt 1
 harini, 2
 hans tathaa 3
 camel jaise trividh pratikon kaa sangyojan dhyaan main lenaa nitant aavashyak he
 On review from this point of view, the theatrical work expressed by the symbols of Abhigyanasakuntal will appear in real terms
 
 1 - 1 In the beginning of this play, on the suggestion of the sutradhara, Nati sings a summer song: --- "palchumbhittani Bhramarai: Sukumarakesar Shikhani
 avatansainti daymanah pramadah shiriskusumani
 
 " yahan kaha gaya he ki bhramaron ke dwaara ek kshan ke liye chumbit shirispushpon ko uske prati dayaa dikhaanevaali pramadaayen dhaaran karke apane aapako sushobhit karti he
 Or say that, those flowers give pride of jewelery
 tikaakar raghavbhatta kehete he ki yahan shirispushpon ko dhaaran karanevaali pramadaon se shakuntala kaa hi nirdesh karnaa abhisht he
 But here some serious meaning also appears hidden
 kalidas shakuntala ke liye aage chal kar kahanevaale he ki usko sushobhan priy tha, tathaapi vah vrikshon ke ek parn ko bhi kadaapi nahin todti thi
 Here the question is, then why did she wear Shirishpushop in her ears? The poignant answer to this question is given in nati-geet
 bhramar pushpon par ek kshan ke liye baithte he or rasapan karke usko turant chod dete he
 Whatever happens in the life of a woman in the world, the thought of her makes Shakuntala and her mind is in an uneasy state of mind
 isi liye vah aise shiris-pushpon ko apane kaanon main dhaaran karke usko sammanit karti he
 Rajarshi Vishwamitra adopted Maneka for a moment and immediately abandoned her
 lekin kshanik sanyog se jo santati paidaa hui vah thi shakuntala
 In this way, the aforementioned feeling imprinted behind the heroine who bears the Shirishpushpi is associated with the story of her birth
 koi bhi stri kisi bhi purush kaa kshanik prem praapt ke, yadi uske dwaara parityakt ho jaati he, to us stri kaa jivan to nishchit rup se karunajanak ho hi jaataa he
 But the progeny that arises from that momentary coincidence also poses a problem of her recognition, which is painful
 strijivan main kadachit paidaa honevaali aisi peedajanak niyati, jisko is nati-geet main vyakt kii gai he usko dushyant kab samajhataa he ? vah hamen dekhnaa he
 And, when is the recognition of Shakuntala's son Bharata as "doshiyanti" proven? That too is to be seen incidentally
 naatak kii gati kaa yah pratham nirdesh natigeet main rakhaa gaya he or sheershak main aaye hue "abhigyaan" shabd ke saath uskaa sambandh he
 In the Shakuntalopakhyana mentioned in the Mahabharata, the problem of recognition of the son of Shakuntala was at the center
 atah prakrut main nati-geet kaa gahera marm samajhnaa atyaavashyak he
 In the same context, in this play, the symbol of Bhramar used for Dushyant, and the symbolic instructions of various flowers like Shirish, Amramanjari and Kamal used for the heroine, are considered
 
 1 - 2 At the beginning of the first digit, Mrigayavihari King Dushyant enters
 tab nepathy se aawaaj aati he ki 'na hantavyo, na hantavyah, ashramamrigoreshyam' iti
 Dushyant is said to be - tat sadukrutasandhan pratishar saikam
 aartatrany vah shastram, na prahartumnagasi
 After listening to this sound of Kanvamuni's disciples, King Dushyant, who came out for Mrigaya, immediately codifies his arrow
 tab uske pratibhaav main munijan raja ko aashirvachan dete he ki- janm yasya purorvanshe yuktarupamidan tav
 putramevangunopetam Chakravartinam Awapanuhi
 
 This is appropriate for you who were born in Purvansh
 kyonki aap ke baan to aart vyakti kii raksha ke liye hi ho sakate he, inase koi nishpaap vyakti par aghat nahin hona chaiye
 And, since you have coddled the arrow, you get a Chakravarti son with the same qualities as you
 is aashirvachan main abhigyaan-shaakuntal naatak kaa charam lakshya kaha gaya he
 So now we have to see how the pace of the entire drama keeps going till the attainment of son
 yahan par, rishikumaron ke kehane par dushyant ne baan kaa to sanharan kar liya tha
 But Dushyanta, who is running after Hari, takes as much Shakuntala's love till the end of the first
 usase malum hota he ki mahakavi ne yahan harin ko shakuntala ke pratik ke rup main rakhaa he
 As the play progresses, it becomes clear to the observers that the biography of the heroine Shakuntala is also being told by the symbol of this deer
 evam aage jaakar usee ke nimitt se vah katha parinat bhi hoti he
 Discontinuity is inherent in the personality of the hunter and the doe
 athwa kahie ki in dono main bhokta-bhogy bhav dikhaai detaa he
 But in the ideal married life, it is equally acceptable that both husband and wife should be a bhakta-bhakti for each other
 atah naatak main aisi adarsh sthiti kaa nirmaan kab hota he vah drashtavy he
 Now the attention of the observers will be drawn to the fact that only after such a similar role is created between the hero-heroine, Dushyant gets the son Bharata
 kyonki kanv muni ke shishyon ne jo aashirwad diye the vah to shabdaantar se, harini ko nahin maarane kii shart par diye the
 In this way, when the second goal is associated with the problem of cognition specified by the Natigata, then it becomes necessary firstly that the samadhi of the hero-heroine's couple-life be proved first
 prekshkon ke kauthuk kaa silsilaa taarkik drushti se is kram main abhivyakt hona apekshit he
 In the first verse itself, the poet has also said symbolically the climax of the entire drama: - By an utterance of Anasuya, he has given symbolic instructions of 'swayamvarvadhu Vanjyotsna' for Shakuntala and 'sahakar-tree' for Nayak Dushyant
 
 yadhyapi yahan swayamvarvadhoo shabd se in donon ke asann vivaah kaa hi suchan kiya gaya he
 But finally, the image of Lata called Vanjyotsna, dependent on the Sahkaravriksha, is also expressing the everlasting ideal of a palatial married life
 
 2 - 0 The first place where the word "abhigyan" is placed in the title of the play, which is related to the tempo associated with it, will be considered
 nati-geet ke shabdon se jo dhwani nikalati he usko yatharth rup main samajhane ke liye puure naatak main sthaan sthaan par jo shirispushp, amramanjari evam camel jaise pushpon ke pratikatmak nirdesh aate he usko bhi dhyaan main lenaa aavashyak he
 And the symbol of Bhramar associated with flowers will also have to be considered simultaneously
 2 – 3 is natyakruti main prayukt vividh pushpon ke pratikon ko samajhane ke baad, ab natigeet se armbh karke anek sthaan par jo bhramar kaa ullekh hua he uski paryaalochana kerani chaiye
 Dushyant has been called Bhramar according to scholarly opinion
 lekin samgr kriti main baar baar ullikhit bhramar kaa pratik saarvatrik rup se kya sachmuch main nayak ke kisi ek hi swabhaav kaa dyotan karata he ? yah prashtavy he
 Because the great poet has not completely represented Bhramar with Dushyant
 is natyakruti main kul milaake paanch baar bhramar kaa ullekh hua he
 Therefore, it is necessary to reconsider the satire expressed by the symbol of Bhramar to commemorate all these mentions
 esha kusumnishnna trushitapi sati bhavantamanurakta
 Pratipalayati Madhukari na Khalu Madhu Vina Tvaya Pibati
 
 S
A
 6 / 19 3 – 0 naatak ke teen gati-nirdeshon main se nati-geet kaa vichaar karne ke baad, ab prathamak main naatak kaa jo charam lakshya prakat rup main kaha gaya he useeki ore dhyaan denge
 The first scene begins with the entry of Mrigayavihari King Dushyant
 dushyant malini nadi ke tat par ghumte phirte mrug par shar-sandhaan karata he
 But the disciples of Kanva Muni cautioned the king that it is the antelope of the ashram, it should not be killed
 dharmabhiru dushyant ne inaki baat kaa sweekaar kiya or apane baan kaa sanharan kar liya
 For this truth, blessings are given to the king when he gets a son of Chakravarti
 yahan dushyant ashram ke mrug kaa shikaar to nahin karata he, lekin kanv kii poshita kanya shakuntala ko dekh kar uski ore aakrisht to jarur hota he
 And by going to the third digit, both of these love also result in gandharva-vivah
 is tarah sabhi kavyarasikon ko shuruyaat se hi malum ho jaataa he ki mahakavi ne shakuntala ke liye harini kaa pratik upyog main liya he
 Here, by the symbol of this deer, the great poet has 1
 Expressed the nature of Shakuntala appearing in front of Dushyant, and 2
 Later on, by standing in full harmony of the life of Shakuntala and Hari, the pang of Karuna Rasa in the fourth quarter Made faster
 
 3 - 2 In the beginning of the play, Dushyant did not kill the deer of the ashram and received the blessings of the son of Chakravarti
 lekin yahan tattvik drushti se soche to sthool mrug ke shikaar ko chod dena paryaapt nahin hoga
 Because if the deer is a symbol of Shakuntala, then Dushyant's depiction of Shakuntala was the same deed as killing the ashram-deer
 atah ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki dushyant ko kab shakuntala kii, evam chakravarti putr kii prapti hoti he
 Such developed drama work is going to be done in the sequence
 anguliyak kii prapti ho jane se durvasa kaa shaap nivrutt ho jaataa he
 And Dushyant remembers Shakuntala
 tab us pratyaakhyaan samay ke shakuntala ke shabd, tiraskaar dikhaati hui shakuntala kii aankhe – yah sab kuch dushyant kii drushti ke saamne aa jate he
 Now Dushyant is suffering very heavily, nothing worldly makes him happy
 shakuntala ke bina sansar asaar lagata he, is liye usne sabhi utsav bandha karvaa diye he
 Looking at such an inscription, it would not be enough to think that after the poet has written the mating adornment in the Tritiyaank, Dushyanta is reminded of Shakuntala only to describe the prettified eclipse in the sequence
 vastutah shashthank ko bariki se dekhne se malum hota he ki kalidas ne pehle teenon ankon main nayak-nayika kaa bahyamilan dikhaaya he, lekin ab ve in donon ke abhyantar milan ko siddh karne ke liye sannaddh hue he
 In this context, 1
 Karya Saktalinhansamithuna of Shakthanka xxrep 4 
 , 2
 Kritnna karnarpitabandhanam sakha xxrep 5 
 And, Esha Kusumnishanna Trishyapati Sati xxrep 4 
 - These three verses are the ultimate need to revisit
 kyonki mahakavi ne yahan hans-mithun, harin-harini, shakuntala ke karnabhushan bane shirispushp tathaa camel evam bhramar jaise kendravarti sabhi pratikon kaa ek hi sthaan par sannivesh kiya he
 And by sequentially appropriating all the important symbols at one place, the poet has inaugurated the heart-rending drama developed here

 6 / 17 Epilogue: 1
 Seeing the above description of Abhigyanasakuntal, it would seem that to symbolize the natural sensations like love, only the symbol of nature can be heartfelt - this is the ultimate secret that was first discovered by Mahakavi Kalidas
 shaayad isi baat ko lekar kavion kii gananaa ke prasang main kanishtikadhishthit kalidas ne anamika ko sarthvati banaai he
 
 2
 paramparaagat samaaj ne purush or stri main jo bhoktri-bhogyabhav sambandh mana he, uske prati kalidas kii nisargasiddh drushti sarvatha bhinn he
 Because where there is physical indulgence, highness is also inherent
 lekin mahakavi ne to nayak-nayika ko harin or harini ke rup main chitrit karke, madhukar – madhukari main saahchary kaa abhilash jagaake tathaa donon ko hansamithun ke rup main ramman dikhaake donon ke bich main samaan rup se bhogyatv evam bhoktrutv avishkrut kiya he
 3
 What is noticeable in the Nati-song is the pitiable condition of momentarily kissed and later abandoned Shirishpushop, the illusory mentioned in it is not noticeable
 mahabharat-prokt shakuntalopakhyaan main keval abhigyaan kii samasya thi or vah besangi rup se varnit thi
 While refining it, the great poet has also included the compassionate destiny of the woman's life, and has given her a covenant with sarishadi flowers spread throughout the nature
 4
 atah "dushyant main bhramaravriti thi or uske unmoolan ke liye durvasa ke shaap kaa kavi ne vidhaan kiya he" aisa mantavy aakarshak hote hue bhi punarikshaneey lagata he
 Because according to the above symbol-discussion, for Dushyant, the symbol of Bhramar does not occur in the whole
 pratyut bhramar ke viniyog se kavi ne natyakaarya kaa jo vikaas pradarshit kiya he, vahi dhyanaspad he
 5
 And "shakuntala did not have the feeling of hospitality, so he too has got the fruit of the curse"
 kyonki kavi ne kahin par bhi shakuntala ko pashchaattap ho rahaa he aisa kaha nahin he
 Rather Shakuntala does not even know till the end that he got any curse
 atah pashchaattap kii baat prakrut main sangat nahin hoti he
 6
 In the beginning of the play itself, it is said that Father Kanva has gone on a journey to Somtirtha to mitigate the antagonistic deity of Shakuntala
 is ke anusandhan main durvasa ke shaap ko durdaiv kaa pratik hi kahana hoga
 And Shakuntala has also said that due to some of my Puranikas, Aryaputra was estranged from me for some time
 is tarah naatak ke upakrmopsanhaar ko dekhte hue durvasa ke shaap ko shakuntala ke durdaiv kaa hi pratik maananaa tarkyukt siddh hota he
 7
 And the symbol of Parbhritika or Chakravak bird used for Shakuntala can also be said to be the manifest form of Shakuntala's misery

 Surkhalpathak is a village in Pithoragarh district of Kumaon division under Uttarakhand state of India in Gangolihat tehsil
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa Princess Yashodhara was the daughter of King Suppabuddha of the Koliya dynasty and his wife Pamita
 yashodhara kii mata- pamita raja shuddhodan kii bahan thim
 At the age of 16, Yashodhara was married to Siddharth Gautama, son of King Shuddhodhana
 baad main siddharth gautam sanyasi hue or gautam buddha ke naam se prasiddh hue
 Yashodhara gave birth to a son named Rahul at the age of 29
 apane pati gautam buddha ke sanyasi ho jane ke baad yashodhara ne apane bete kaa paalan poshan karte hue ek sant kaa jivan apana liya
 He abandoned the valuable garments
 pilaa vastra pahana or din main ek baar bhojan kiya
 When her son Rahul also took retirement, she also became a sanyasini
 unka dehavsaan 78 varsh kii aayu main gautam buddha ke nirvana se 2 varsh pehle hua
 There have been many compositions based on the life of Yashodhara, of which Maithilisharan Gupta's work Yashodhara is very famous
 rajkumaari yashodhara coliy vansh kii putree thi
 Yashodhara's viraha is extremely darun and the reason for being perceived as an obstacle to the path of siddhi seems to hurt his self-respect
 parantu vah naritv ko kisi bhi ansh main hin maanane ko prastut nahin he
 She is an Indian wife, her half-hearted gesture is everywhere
 usamen meraa bhi kuch hoga jo kuch tum paaoge
 All in all Yashodhara is an ideal wife, superior mother and self-centered woman
 parantu gupt ji ne yathasambhav gautam ke paramparaagat udaatt charitra kii raksha kii he
 Although the poet has rejected his beliefs and principles, in the end he has made 'yashodhara' and 'rahul' a follower to protect his famous form
 prastut kavy main vastu ke sanghatak or vikaas main rahul kaa samdhik mahatva he
 If Rahul had not been in the red lap, then perhaps Yashodhara would have chosen death and then why this 'yashodhara' would have been implemented
 'yashodhara' kavy main rahul kaa manovikas ankit he
 He has amazing charm in childlike efforts
 samay ke saath-saath uski buddhi kaa vikaas bhi hota he, jo uski uktiyon se spasht he
 But all this cannot be said as natural
 kahin kahin to rahul praundhon ke samaan tark, yuktipurvak vaartalap karata he, jo janmajaat pratibhasampann balak ke prasang main bhi nishchay hi atiranjana he
 Nazar Muhammad Gondal is a politician in the National Assembly of Pakistan
 He represents NA-109 constituency for Pakistani Punjab
 maapak feeta ek prakaar kaa lacheela rekhni he jo kapadaa, plastic, fibre glass, yaa kisi dhaatu kii patali pattee se bana hota he
 With this we can measure distances in millimeters, centimeters, meters, inches, feet etc
 very easily
 aajkal yah choti yaa bady duuri maapne kaa ek saamaanya aujaar he
 Its length usually ranges from 1 meter to 20 meters
 saamaajik saranchana samajashaastra kii ek moulik avadharana he parantu uski vyakhya vibhinn prakaar se kii gayi he
 Herbert Spencer was so impressed with the biological conformity that he compared social structure to the human body
 unka kahana tha ki jis prakaar sharir ke vibhinn ang hote hai or ve sabhi shaareerik banaavat ko banaaye rakhte hai usee prakaar samaaj ke bhi vibhinn ang hote hai jo samaaj ke banaavat ko banaaye rakhte hai
 Radcliffe Brown's view was that whenever we refer to social structure, we mean social structure by an arrangement in which different elements of that system and structure are related to each other
 tatwon ke is sameekaran or vyavasthit paddati ko hi saranchana kaha ja saktaa he
 In terms of social structure, one considers the individual as the unit of that structure
 vyakti saamaajik saranchana main ek sthaan par bane hote hai
 They have to take place in a system under a social process under which they have got that place due to certain patterns
 is prakaar saamaajik saranchana vyakti kaa ek vyavasthit rup he jisamen unke saamaajik sambandh kisi khaas sansthaatmak mulyon se niyantrit hote hai
 If we talk about the structure of the family, then we will talk about the people living in that family, people who are associated with some relations of that family
 us parivaar ke sadsy kii ek khaas bhoomika adaa karnaa padataa he
 In this way, all people in an organization need to be connected to each other to perform their role
 es epa nadel ne bhi saranchana shabd kii vyakhya prastut karte hue ise ek vyavasthit samgr ke ang se jodakar dekha he jisamen us vyavastha se sabhi tatv ek-duusare se jude hote hai
 According to him, three elements always exist in the society - ye sabhi pratimaan va niyam vyakti kii sthiti or bhoomika ko nirdhaarit karte hai
 Explaining the social structure, some sociologists have also given importance to the matter of permanent relations
 unka maananaa he ki kisi bhi banaavat se hamaara taatpary us banaavat ko banane vaale un angon se hai jo sthaayee rup se us banaavat ko banaaye rakhane main apana mahatvapurn yogadan dete hai
 In revealing this view, Harry M
 Johnson has emphasized the mutual self-determination of the role and the structural relationship of the subgroup
 pratimaanon ke do swaroop kii charchaa karte hue unhone nimna pratimaanon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Thus, it can be said that most sociologists have explained two theoretical aspects while explaining social structure
 pehle shrenee main ham un saiddhanthik vichaar kii baat kar sakate hai jisamen saamaajik saranchana kaa ek aisa swaroop hota he jise dekha va parkhaa ja saktaa he
 In the theory of functionalism, there is a clear form of social structure that can be described
 duusari shrenee main un samajashastreey rachanaaon kii baat kii jaati he jisamen samaaj kii banaavat kaa amurtt swaroop hota he jise dekha va parkhaa nahin ja saktaa he
 The third type of idea has been theorized by some sociologists in which social structure ties are stabilized
 sambandhon ko ek vaastavik aadhaar miltaa he
 Both Radcliffe Brown and SF Nadel advocated the idea that talked about some enduring elements of social structure that also regulate a person's behavior and provide an institutional basis for controlling their behavior
 tolkat parcens kaa kahana tha ki saamaajik vyavastha ke dwaara samaaj kii banaavat ko samajha ja saktaa he
 He thought that to understand any social structure, it is necessary to understand the values of that society and its institutional nature
 unke anusaar kisi bhi saamaajik vyavastha ko chaar pramukh saamaajik kaary sthaayee rup se nishpadit karne padate hai- All of these functions are subgroups to be well edited
 jin upasamooh ko saamaajik vyavastha se judakar kaam karnaa hota he or ye sabhi kaary ek sansthaatmak tareeke se nishpadit baaten hai
 The work of adaptation is executed by the economic system which acts as an organ or important unit of the social system
 isi prakaar lakshya upalibdh kaa kaary raajnneetik vyavastha se hota he jo saamaajik vyavastha ke ek ang yaa mahatvapurn ikai ke rup main yah kaary karata he
 The work of pattern maintenance is performed by kinship
 ekikaran kaa kaary saanskrithik vyavastha tathaa saamudayik sanghathan ke dwaara nishpadit hota he
 It is clear from the above discussion that the concept of social structure can be seen by linking it with an important concept and principle
 saamaajik saranchana kii avadharana ko sangharsh ke siddhanth se jodakar bhi dekha jaataa he parantu saamaajik vyavastha ke sandarbh main iske siddhanton ko kuch samajashastriyon ne pahachaanaa he parantu isaki vivechna se abhi bhi paramparaagat samajashaastra parhez karte hai
 Inter-language means - 'a common language among many languages'
 yah ek antar-rashtriya madadgaar bhashaa he
 Since one language is completely different from another, such a language can be artificial rather than natural
 aadhunik yug main vishwa antarbhasha banane ke do prayaas kiye gaye
 The first attempt was made in 1908 AD by a linguist named Giusepo Peiano and the second attempt was made by the International Cooperative Language Association, but the language was not successful in terms of popularity

 International: sthaneey: Those words of any language are called avayyas in the form of which there is no disorder due to gender, speech, man, factor, time etc
 aise shabd har sthiti main apane mularoop main bane rahete he
 Since avayya does not transform, such words are invariable
 avyay kaa shabdic arth he- 'jo vyay na ho
 ' avyay ke paanch prakaar ke hote hai- There are four distinctions of adverbs according to meaning - kriya-visheshan Dayanand Anglo Vedic School is the name of a series of schools and colleges started in some parts of undivided India

 He called for "going back to the Vedas" which in reality meant "spreading education"
 swami dayanand kaa vishwaas tha ki shiksha ke prasar ke dwaara hi desh ke kone-kone main jagriti aayegi
 In order to realize the dreams of Maharishi Dayanand, some of his knowledgeable, dedicated and abandoned followers established "dayanand Anglo Vedic College Trust and Management Committee"

 For many years, French officials struggled unsuccessfully in the slums of Paris

 Not satisfied with building just a few houses, Le Corbusier began studying the entire city
 1922 main unhone 30 lakh logon kii "aadhunik nagari" kii yojana prastut kii
 At the center of this plan was the sixty-storey skyscrapers, which were steel-framed office buildings and had glass walls

 Just in the middle was a traffic center, with bus, train, and street intersections at different levels and at the top an airport

 Le Corbusier hoped that French industrialists with political ambitions would move in this direction and give society a facelift by copying Taylorist and Fordist policies from American industries

 Perhaps the biggest difference between the modern city and Ojaswi Nagar was that the new idea does not have a class-based division, the houses are decided on the basis of family size, not on the basis of economic status

 in binduon ke bare main unhone apni patrika lespri novyuu or pustak vars oon architekchar main likhaa he, inkaa vikaas ve 1920 ke dashak main kar rahe the
 First, Le Corbusier built most of the structure over the ground, using pillows for support - a slab of concrete
 ye piloti ghar kaa dhaanchaa sambhalate or inaki badaulat agali do binduon ko samarthan miltaa - ek mukt diwaal, yani aisi deevaaren jinhen vazan uthaani kii zarurat na ti or vaastushilpi unhen jaise chaahe bana saktaa tha or ek khulaa farsh, yani har farsh ko jaise chaahe kamaron main baanta ja saktaa tha, deevaaron kii chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin thi
 The second floor of the Villa Savoy features long strips of windows that allow all four spaces to be seen uninterrupted
 yah khaali sthaan unki pranali kii chauthi bindu tha
 The fifth point is the garden on the roof - greenery on the roof in lieu of the greenery that the building destroyed

 The white tubed railing is reminiscent of the "sea ship" industrial beauty that Le Corbusier loved

 Le Corbusier used the golden ratio in his modular system to measure architectural proportions
 is pranali ko unhone vitruvius, leonardo da vinci ke "vitruvian purush", leone batista albarti or anyon ke kaam ko aage badhaane kii tarah hi mana, jo ki vaastushilp ke pradarshan or kaam ko sudhaarney main maanav sharir ke anupaaton kaa prayog karte aa rahe the
 In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier also improved the system through human measurements, Fibonacci numbers, and dual units
 ve leonardo ke maanviya anupato main sunahare anupaat ke suzav ko duusari had tak le gaye
 He divided the length of the human body into two portions on the navel, based on the golden ratio, then divided these portions on the feet and throat again into the golden ratio; They used these golden ratios in the modular system

 In the civic scheme he sought a place from the Vichy regime and was given a place in a committee to study on urbanism

 Although the politics of Lagardale and Veloi were part of fascism, anti-semitism, and post-modernism, it is difficult to say how much of Le Corbusier's involvement with all these movements

 His later work at the site of construction reveals a good understanding of the complex impact of modernism, but his civil works have also been criticized by many
 takneekee itihasvid va vaastushills maseekshak louis mamford ne beete kal kaa aane vaale kal kaa shahar main kehete hai, James Howard Kunstler, a member of the neo-urbanism movement, described Lee Carbuzier's city planning plan as destructive and expensive: lee corbuziye praarambhik ucch aadhuniktaa ke agrani vaastushilpi netaa the, jinaki 1925 kii plan vaoicine thi daayen tat par paris ke puure marai jile ko tahas nahas kar ke chaudee sadakon ke bich samaan dikhne vaali gaganchumbiyaan bana dena
 It was the fate of Paris that whenever he took the plan over the next forty years, the city officials laughed at him - and Le Corbusier was self-effacing
 lekin badakismati yah he ki plan voisin yojana ko dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad do amareeki yojanakaaron ne lagu kiya or uski badaulat chicago kii kukhyat kabrini green rihaayshi pariyojna or usee tarah kii bisiyon or chize puure desh main paidaa huin

 In the design of the buildings, Le Corbusier opposed any type of decoration

 For many years, many architects worked with him in Le Corbusier's studio and many of them became well-known themselves, such as the painter-architect Nadir Afonso who imbibed Le Corbusier's ideas into his beauty theory

 The destruction of traditional urban spaces became more accepted through the ideas of Le Corbusier, as this new city was built with low density, low-cost suburban and wide roads in rural areas, which led to the construction of a middle-class family house
 is andolan main nimna madhyam varg va kamgir virgon ke alag thalag pade nagari graamon kaa anya ilaakon se judaav, arthath upnagareey va gramin ilaakon kaa nagareey vyavsaayik kendron se judaav ke liye lee corboojier ke niyojan main koi jagah nahin thi
 This was because according to planning, roads used to come from the top, bottom or side of the residential areas of the working class and lower middle class

 As jobs progressed to the suburban ends coming to the end of these roads, urban villagers found their communities cut off from these major roads; Nor did they have public transport facilities so that they could economically do jobs in suburban centers

 The question mark has arisen over the views of Le Corbusier due to increasing traffic expenses and interest in middle and upper class people towards suburban and rural lifestyle
 ab nagareey ilaake zyaada vaanchit hai
 People are preferring to stay in condominiums in the city in many places
 kai kendriya vyavsaayik kendron main ab rihaishi ilaake bhi ban gaye hai yaa ban rahe hai
 Le Corbusier deliberately created myths about himself and during his lifetime he was highly respected, and after his death, his devotees made him an angel who could do nothing wrong
 lekin 1950 ke dashak main pehali shankaaye uthni shuru huin, khaas taur par unke apane hi shishyon dwaara nibandhon main, jaise ki james stirling va colin ro dwaara, jinhone unke nagar sambandhi vichaaron ko khatarnaak bataaya

 The end of the 20th century saw many changes in the governance of the UK, with the establishment of devolved national administrations for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales following pre-legislative context
