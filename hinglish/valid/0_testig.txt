 The extra-3 or 3-extra binary code is a self-complementary binary coded decimal code and numeral system
 yah ek pakshpaati pratinidhitiv he
 Extra-3 was used on some older computers, as well as cash registers and hand-held portable electronic calculators of the 1970s, among other uses
 pakshpatpurna code,ek purv nirdhaarit sankhya 'en' ek pakshpatpurna ek mulya ke rup main upyog karte hue sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak sankhya kaa ek santulit sankhya ke saath mulyon kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye ek tarika he

 The largest binary number represents the largest value
 ek number,127 ko ancode karne ke liye,bas prayek dashamalav ank ke kutabaddh detaa he 
 Additional-3 arithmetic, common non-biased, BCD or binary system uses different algorithms than positional numbers
 do atirikt-3 ank jodne ke baad, kachche yoga he atirikt-6
 For example, after adding 1 and 2, the sum is 6 instead of 3
 aadesh main is samasya ko dur karne ke liye,do ank jodne ke baad,dwiadhari 0011 ko ghataakar agar parinamswaroop ankon dashamalav 10 se bhi kam he atirikt purvaagrah ko dur karne ke liye aavashyak he,ek atipravaah hua he to binary 1101main ghataana he
 The primary advantage of extra-3 coding over non-biased coding is that a decimal number can be nine 'complemented as easily as a binary number can be complemented; just invert all bits
 iske alaava,jab do atirikt-3 ankon kaa yoga 9 se adhik he, ek 4 bit yojak kaa kairi sa ucch sthapit kiya jayega
 The reason for this works is the sum of two digits, an "extra", after adding the result value to 6
 kyonki ek 4- bit purnank keval maanon 15 karne ke liye pakad kar sakate hai 0,6 kii ek atirikt matlab yah he ki 9 se adhik kisi bhi raashi kaa hoga atipravaah

 There are eleven classes in Swargadikand: is kand main das varg hai: There are six sections in this scandal: anya sanskrit koshon kii bhaanti amarkosh bhi chandobaddh rachana he
 The reason for this is that the ancient pandits of India tended to give less importance to "book system"
 unke liye kosh kaa uchit upyog vahi vidvan kar paata he jise vah kanthsth ho
 Shlokas become memorized quickly
 isliye sanskrit ke sabhi madhyakaalin kosh padya main hai
 Seventy years ago the Italian poet Pavolini proved that these Sanskrit lexicons are a collection of important and less useful words for poets
 amarkosh aisa hi ek kosh he
 The real name of Amarkosh is Namliganushasana according to Amarsingh

 The influence of buddhist-deformed-sanskrit is also evident, such as Arkabandhu, a namapariya of Buddha

 The immune system is a collection of biological processes that occur within an organism that first identify and then kill pathogens and tumor cells and protect that organism from diseases
 yah vishaanuon se lekar paraseete krimiyon jaise vibhinn prakaar ke agent kii pahchaan karne me sakasham hoti he, saath hi yah in agenton ko jeev kii swasth koshikaon or utakon se alag pahchaan sakati he, taaki yah un ke viruddh pratikriya naa kare or puri pranali sucharu rup se kaary kare
 Identifying pathogens is a complex task because the pathogens adapt very rapidly and adapt themselves in such a way that they can successfully infect their nutrients by escaping the immune system
 sharir kii pratiraksha-pranali main kharabi aane se rog main pravesh kar jate hai
 Immune system dysfunction is called immunodeficiency
 immunodefishiency yaa to kisi anuvaanshik rog ke kaaran ho saktaa he, yaa phir kuch khaas dawaaon yaa sankraman ke kaaran bhi sambhav he
 An example of this is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome that spreads due to HIV virus
 thik iske vipareet swapratirakshit rog ek uttejit auto immune system ke kaaran hote hai jo saadhaaran utakon par bahari jeev hone kaa andeh kar un par akraman karata he

 The body's power to prevent infectious diseases is called immunity
 kintu sabhi shaktiyaan pratiraksha main nahin gini jaatin
 The skin does not allow bacteria to enter the body
 amashayik ras kaa amla jeevanuon ko nasht kar detaa he, kintu yah pratiraksha ke antargat nahin aata
 These are natural means of protecting the body
 pratiraksha se arth he brahya proteinon ko rakt main upasthit vishisht vastuon dwaara nasht kar daalane kii shakti
 Bacteria that enter the body produce proteins by dissolving their bodies
 unki nasht kar dene kii shakti rakt main hoti he
 The form of this action is chemical and physical, although this power is natural to some extent, but it is particularly acquired and due to the entry of bacteria and viruses into the body, these things destroy the body
 yah vishisht pratiraksha kehalaati he
 The germs of these diseases are entered into the body of the creature, then the body itself creates the things that destroy them
 yah sakriy rog kshamta he
 To produce it, the thing that is inserted into the body is called a vaccine
 jab ek jantu ke sharir main vaxin pravisht karne se sakriy kshamta utpann ho jaati he, to uske sharir se thodaa rakt nikaalkar, uske serum ko pruthak karke, usko duusare jantu ke sharir main pravisht karne se niskriy kshamta utpann hoti he
 That is, the body of one animal produces those bactericidal items and these immune items are entered into the body of another animal and they are endowed with curative power
 yah hui niskriy pratiraksha
 It is used a lot in medicine
 diphtheria, titanas aadi rogon kii isi prakaar taiyaar kiye gaye antitoxic serum se chikitsa kii jaati he
 Blood has many types of bactericidal powers
 rakt kii shwet kanikaon main jeevanu tathaa sab bahya vastuon ko kha jane kii shakti hoti he
 This function is called bacteriology
 rakt jeevanuon ko galaa detaa he, jo jeevanulayan kaha jaataa he
 The reason for this is a chemical substance present in the blood, which is called bacteriolysin
 rakt main jeevanuon ko baandh dene kii bhi shakti hoti he
 The infectious animals reach the body and are made from a bunch of bacteria
 unki gatishakti nasht ho jaati he
 This phenomenon is called agglutination and the object that causes it is called agglutinin
 jeevanu sharir main jeevvish utpann karte hai
 The immune bacterium also produces powers that kill these poisons, which are called antigenic poisons
 ye vishisht vastuen hoti hai
 The disease against which immunity is done, it destroys or destroys the bacteria of the same disease
 yahi vishisht pratiraksha kehalaati he
 Blood also has the power to dissolve the blood cells of other animals, which is called bleeding
 sakriy pratiraksha utpann karne ke liye rogon ke jeevanuon ko sharir main pravisht kiya jaataa he
 Immunity against bacteria is produced by the bacteria of a single disease
 pravisht karne se purv jeevanuon kii shakti or sankhya donon ko itnaa gata diya jaataa he ki usase jantu ko haani na pahunche, arthath itnaa bhayankar rog na ho ki uski mrityu ho jaay
 With this first volume, the animal gets a mild attack of disease, but things start destroying those bacteria in his body
 jin vastuon ko pravisht kiya jaataa he, ve pratijan kehalaati hai or unase rakt main pratipind banate hai
 a few days later a second quantity of animals is given, in which the number of bacteria is already two times or more
 jantu isko bhi sahan kar letaa he
 After a few days, a third dose is given, which is more than the second
 isse bhi jantu kuch hi din main ubar aata he
 Similarly, the quantity is increased equally until the animal tolerates several hundred times more than the first
 is samay tak jantu ke rakt main bahut badi maatra main pratipind ban chuktaa he
 Hence the animal is completely immune
 rogon ke akraman main bhi yahi hoti he
 Antibodies are formed in the body
 yahi sakriy pratiraksha hoti he
 To produce it, the solution of bacteria which is entered in the body is usually called vaccine
 is prakaar kii pratiraksha chirsthayee bhi hoti he
 After generating the appropriate capacity, after separating the serum from the blood of that animal, after being purified by chemical methods, it is used for healing
 jab is serum ko rogi ke sharir main pravisht kiya jaataa he, to usamen niskriy pratiraksha utpann hoti he, arthath serum main upasthit pratipindon ke kaaran uskaa sharir to pratiraksha se sampann ho jaataa he, kintu rogi kaa sharir pratiraksha utpann nahin karata
 Antibodies and antibodies that produce immunity are produced by another body
 keval rogi ke sharir main pravisht kar die jate hai
 Serum is used in the treatment of diseases
 serum main upasthit prativish kii maatra nirdhaarit kar lee gai he or usko antarrashtriya ekank kaha jaataa he
 It is used for both prevention and treatment
 nimnlikhit rogon kii vishesh oshadhi antiserum he : 1

 sharir ke samast utakon par uskaa vishaiylla prabhaav hota he
 Antivirus resolves this poison, but its quantity should be sufficient for the amount of venom
 yah bhalee bhanti pramanit ho chukaa he ki prativish isaki vishisht oshadhi he
