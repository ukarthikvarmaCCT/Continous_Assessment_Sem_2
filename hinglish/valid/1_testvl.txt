 ek aam ranneeti he gend ko bagal kii deevaaron par se sidhe peeche ke konon par upar maarna; yah buniyadi squash shot he, ise ek "rail", street drive, wal, yaa "lenth" ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai
 After hitting this shot, the player moves to the "T" in the center of the court so that he is in a better position to face the opponent's return
 saamne ke konon main halake yaa "laghu" shot ke saath hamalaa karne ke parinamswaroop pratidwandvi ko court kaa adhikansh hissaa aavrutt karnaa padataa he, jisase vijeta kaa parinaam turant nikal saktaa he
 The boast or angle shot is deliberately hit on the side wall before reaching the front of the ball
 is shot ko dhokhe ke liye or pratidwandvi ko phir se adhikansh court ko aavrutt karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 a dominant strategy in squash is to "dominate T"
 Skilled players will return the shot and then return to the "T" before playing the next shot
 From this position, the player can quickly use any part of the court with minimal antics to get the opponent's next shot
 anbhavi khilaadiyon ke bich reliyon main 30 yaa adhik shot ho sakate hai or isliye fitness par vishesh jor diya jaataa he, aerobics or gaiyr-aerobics, donon par
 jaise-jaise khilaadi adhik kushal ho jate hai, vishesh rup se, shot ko praapt karne main behatar ho jate hai to ank praapt karnaa, aksar sangharshan kaa yuddh ban jaataa he
 At higher levels of the game, a more fit player is in a better position
 aakhri pal main gend kii disha badalane kii kshamta bhi, pratidwandvi ko asantulit karne ke liye mahatvapurn he
 Expert players can detect an opponent's shot in the tenth of a second with more acuity than an average player, allowing them to react quickly
 chunki do khilaadiyon ko ek saajha sthaan ke bheetar hi simit kar diya jaataa he, hastkshep or baadha is khel ke anivaary pahalu hote hai
 Normally, the rule requires the player to see clearly before hitting the ball against the front wall, to face the ball in a straight line, a proper rotation of any part of the court and an uninterrupted shot, Whether in front, on the side, or on the back wall to which they are capable, they are entitled
 jab hastkshep hota he, to ek khilaadi ek "let" ke liye apil kar saktaa he or referi hastkshep kii seemaa kii vyakhya karata he
 The referee may choose to allow a lay and then have the player replay that point, or may provide a "stroke" to the appealing player, depending on the level of interference, the referee observes
 The intervening player made enough efforts to protect it and whether the disrupted player was likely to take a decisive shot if he was not interrupted
 is sab ke liye ek apwaad tab hota he jab hastkshep karne vaala khilaadi duusare khilaadi kii harakat ke raste main sidhe hota he or vah prabhavi rup se us harakat ko roak detaa he, to aise maamle main hameshaa ek stroke pradaan kiya jaataa he
 When it is understood that the impediment was too low or not, or both, it is impossible to tell, as a rule, to provide a lat to maintain the continuity of the game and discourage fake appeals for the lat
 Should not be allowed
 kyonki hastkshep kii prakruti or uski tivrata kii vyakhya main vyaktiparak lakshan ke kaaran, let or stroke kaa pradaan aksar vivaadaaspad hota he
 It is considered an interference when a player's shot touches his opponent before being hit on the front wall
 pratidwandvi ko lagane se pehle yadi gend bagal vaali diwaar kii ore ja rahi thi yaa yadi yah pehle hi bagal vaali diwaar se takaraa chuki he or ab saamne kii diwaar kii taraf sidhe bad rahi he to yah aam taur par ek let hota he
 However, it is a stroke for the player who hit the ball if the ball was moving directly towards the front wall and hit the opponent before hitting the adjacent wall
 aam taur par ek khilaadi ko gend lagane ke baad, donon khilaadi sthir khadey ho jate hai, yadi vah khilaadi jise gend lagi he, gend ko maarane vaale khilaadi ke sidhe saamne khadaa he to vah stroke kho detaa he or yadi vah saamne nahin khadaa he, to ek let khelaa jaataa he
 If it is understood that the player hitting the ball is deliberately trying to hit his opponent, he will lose the stroke
 in sab kaa ek apwaad tab hota he jab gend ko maarane vaala khilaadi "ternd" ho jaae, yani, gend use ek taraf se paas kar jaati he, lekin jab vah peeche kii diwaar se waapas aati he tab vah use martha he
 In these cases, the stroke goes to the player who got the ball

 Squash is played all over the world and is similar to tennis in skill and fitness requirements, but its major limitation has been to watch it as a spectator, whether sitting on the sports court or on television
 The ball moves so fast that it is very difficult for television viewers to see it, although some tournaments have attempted to solve the problem by using a special coated ball to increase visibility

 According to James Calvin, even though China won a military victory, it lost its international image

 These countries saw China's goals as world conquest and clearly believed that China was the aggressor in the border war

 Due to the inability to anticipate the possibility of Chinese invasion of India, Prime Minister Nehru faced harsh criticism from government officials for promoting pacifist relations with China

 The Indian Army was divided due to Krishna Menon's policies of "good appointment to the favored" and the 1962 war was seen by the Indians as a combination of a military defeat and a political disaster
 uplabdh vikalpon par gaur na karke balki america salaah ke tahat bharat ne vaayu sena kaa upyog chini sainiko ko waapas khadedane main nahin kiya

 a persistent environmental problem that Chiang Mai is facing is the problem of increasing air pollution which mainly starts in April and lasts for the next several weeks
 is mudde ko kuch samay se sweekaar kiya ja rahaa he
 In 1996, the fourth International Network of Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Conference, which was held that year in Chiang Mai, the then Governor of Chiang Mai, Virachai Navbunien, was the guest speaker, Dr
 Zakapan Vongburanawatt, who was at that time social at Mai Chiang University Was invited Dean of the Faculty of Science, so that he could consider the efforts being made for air pollution in Chiang Mai
 Door-to exchanged
 Dr
 Wongburanawatt said at the time in 1994 that, there was an increasing number of urban citizens in hospitals who come for respiratory problems due to air pollution
 thailand kaa prakritik sansaadhan or paryaavaran mantralay kaa pradooshan niyantran vibhaag jan jaagrukta abhiyaan or anya pahalon ke saath is samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye sakriy hai
 During this period, unlike the rest of the year, air quality in Chiang Mai is often below the standard because dust particles reach levels twice their standard
 mausam vibhaag ke uttari centre ne bataaya he ki china ke kam dabaav ke kshetra thai myanmar seemaa ke aas-paas jangalon kii dhuen se prabhavit hote hai
 Air quality in Chiang Mai has deteriorated markedly over the last ten years
 is samasya ko kai tarah kii pahal ke dwaara sulajhaaye jane kaa praytn chal rahaa he or kuch had tak, shaharon main aarthik vikaas main vruddhi ke saath, nakaaratmak paryaavarniya prabhaav ko rokane ke liye kiye ja rahe hai
 Often, mist prevails in the city during this period and it starts raining
 sookshm dhul ke kanon ke str kaa kabhi kabhi pareekshan kiya gaya he jo ki prati ghan meter 190 se 243 microgram ke bich nikle hai
 Minor sources of dust-borne pollution in Chiang Mai also include burning objects, including cremation, burning of trash, or smoke emanating from vehicles due to bad diesel
 in maamuli kaarnon main nirmaan or khudaai ke dauraan udati hui dhul bhi jud jaati he
 As the images from the satellite show, the main reason for air pollution is the customary practice in the mountainous areas in the hills, under which scrub forests are cleared by burning, especially on the Thai Myanmar border
 chiang maai kii samasya isliye bhi bad jaati he kyonki yah shahar, los angeles or salt lake shahar kii tarah hi, pahadiyon se ghira hua ek prakritik bhugolic katoraa he
 As a result, the movement of air slows down and it also picks up dust particles from cars and burning waste
 is vyutkram prabhaav kii vajah se, jab katore main hawa urti he, tab yah phir se palatati he or phir se shahar main hi baith jaati he
 This goes on till the winds do not change or the rain showers the wind
 The Thailand Pollution Control Department of Thailand's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has been actively trying to find a solution to this dangerous problem and has been successful in reducing the air quality index number of Chiang Mai for several years
 is samasya ko, chiyand maai or thailand main chalane vaale vibhinn rang ke saarvajanik parivahanjo savaariyon ko bahut saste kiraye par lete hai or jinhen songthev kehete hai, teevr kar dete hai
 Red colored Songthaves take passengers everywhere in the city at their request while Songthes of other colors walk the prescribed routes

 To increase the horsepower of these vehicles, their exhaust system is removed, which increases the amount of carbon emissions and heavy metals that come out of the rear of the vehicles
 natijatan, chiang maai kii sadakon par motor cycle chalaanaa teji se kathin hota ja rahaa he
 Motorcycle riders can easily be seen moving behind these trucks, saving their respiratory tract
 yahi baat prasidd tuk-tuk ke vishay main bhi kahi ja sakati he jo thailand main sarvatra paae jate hai
 City officials are well aware of this issue and have started a campaign, under which all yellow and blue meter taxis will be replaced, replacing all old and defective vehicles
 As slowly, these old quality vehicles are being removed, it is still to be seen whether the exchange body will be able to make changes in Chiang Mai, facing the opposition of the drivers of these vehicles as these drivers have Traditionally, they have made a living in this way for the last several years
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki chiang maai hi keval aisa shahar nahin he jo is samasya se jujh rahaa he kyonki sampoorn thailand main tuk-tuk or songtheove hi kam laagat vaale parivahan ke mukhya saadhan hai
 Unfortunately, because the situation in Chiang Mai is like an inverted bowl, the carbon content emitted from the vehicles makes the problem more serious
 pichley kai saalon se, kyonki chiang maai kaa vaayu gunvattta suchakank anya kshetron ke mukaable adhik se adhik kharaab ho gaya he, isliye is samasya ko ab sthaneey str par pahachaanaa ja rahaa he
 Doctors in Chiang Mai have seen an increase in people coming to them with upper breathing difficulties
 chiang maai main ab sabhi vaahanon ke liye utsarjan maanakon ke kade niyam banaae hai
 Since 2008, police occasionally test vehicle emissions at the site by placing road-closing blocks on the road and officials will enact laws prohibiting impaired vehicles, as they work toward creating a cleaner environment in Chiang Mai The work is in progress

 Jain literature is very vast
 adhikansh main vah dharmik sahitya hi he
 This literature has been written in Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages
 mahavir kii pravritiyon kaa centre magadh rahaa he, isaliye unhone yahan kii lokbhasha ardhamagadhi main apana upadesh diya jo uplabdh jain aagmon main surakshit he
 These are 45 and consider Shwetambara Jain evidence, not Digambara Jain
 dingbaron ke anusaar aagam sahitya kaaldosh se vicchhinn ho gaya he
 Digambara accepts the hetkhandagam which has been considered part of the 12th Anglicism
 digambaron ke pracheen sahitya kii bhashaa shauraseni he
 Later, Jain pundits enriched the language literature by writing their compositions in the later folk-languages of Apabhransh and Apabhransh
 adikalin sahitya main jain sahitya ke granth sarvaadhik sankhya main or sabase pramanik rup main milte hai
 Jain creators composed a variety of texts like Purana poetry, Charit poetry, Katha poetry, Ras poetry
 swayambhu, pushp danta, hemchandra, somprabh suri aadi mukhya jain kavi hai
 He also made the folk tales prevalent among Hindus the subject of his creations and showed his culmination to be different from tradition
 jain-sahitya kaa pracheenatam bhaag ‘aagam’ ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 These proceeds are 46- aagam granth kaaphi pracheen he, tathaa jo sthaan vaidic sahitya kshetra main veda kaa or buddha sahitya main tripitak kaa he, vahi sthaan jain sahitya main aagmon kaa he
 In the Agam texts, there is a compilation of many stories and stories related to the teachings of Mahavira and Jain culture
 jain parampara ke anusaar mahavir nirvana ke 160 varsh pashchaat magadh deshon main bahut baari dushkaal padaa, jiske falswaroop jain bhikshuon ko anyatra vihaar karnaa padaa
 At the end of the period, Shramana gathered in Pataliputra and eleven organs were compiled piece by piece, the twelfth organ was not remembered, so it could not be compiled
 is sammelan ko 'patliputra-vaachana' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 After some time, when the Agama literature began to be severed again, the second conference of Jain monks took place after 827 or 840 years of Mahavir Nirvana
 ek aryaskandil kii adhyakshata main mathura main tathaa doosraa nagarjun suri kii adhyakshata main valbhi main
 The conference at Mathura has been called 'mathuri-vachana'
 tatpashchaat lagbhag 150 varsh baad, mahavir nirvana ke 980 yaa 993 varsh baad valbhi main devardhigani kshamashraman kii adhyakshata main saadhuon kaa chauthaa sammelan hua, jisamen suvyavasthit rup se aagmon kaa antim baar sankalan kiya gaya
 It is called by the name of 'valabhi-vachana'
 vartmaan aagam isi sankalana kaa rup he
 The history of the above three conferences of the Jain Agama shows that Agama literature suffered from time to time, and this literature in its original form could not remain secure
 yahi kaaran maaloom hota he ki baudhon ke vipul sahitya ke mukaable yah sahitya bahut nune he, tathaa is sahitya main vikaar aa jane se hi sambhavtah digambar sampradaay ne ise maananaa asweekaar kar diya
 This literature depicting the economic and social condition of India from the fourth century BC to the fifth century CE is of importance in many respects
 ayaarang, sooyagdan, uttarajaiyan, dasveyali aadi granthon main jo jain bhikshuon ke aachaar-vichaaron kaa vistrut varnan he, vah baudhon ke dhammapad, suttanipat tathaa mahabharat aadi granthon se bahut anshon main mail khaataa he, or dow
 vinternij aadi vidwaanon ke kathananusaar vah shraman-kavy kaa pratik he
 In terms of language and subject etc
, this part of Jain proceeds seems to be the oldest
 bhagwati kalpasutra, ovaiy, thanang, niryavali aadi granthon main shraman bhagavan mahavir, unki charya, unke upadeshon tathaa tatkaaleen raja, rajkumaar or unke yuddh aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisase jain itihaas kii luptpraaya anek anushrutiyon kaa pataa lagata he
 Nayadhammakha, Uvasagadasa, Antagadadasa, Anuttarovvaiyadsa, Vivagasuya, etc
, have many stories and stories told by Mahavira and his disciples, in which many things related to Jain tradition are introduced
 rypanesi, jeevabhigam, pannavna aadi granthon main vaastushastra, sangeet, vanaspati aadi sambandhi anek mahatvapurn vishyon kaa varnan he jo praayah anyatra uplabdh nahin hota he
 Aanthasutras have a detailed description of the dieting and atonement etc
 of the sages, which can be compared with the Vinayapitaka of Buddhists
 vrihatkalpasutra main bataaya gaya he ki jab mahavir saket subhumibhag naamak udyaan main vihaar karte the to us samay unhone apane bhikshu-bhikshuniyon ko saket ke purv main ang-magadh tak dakshai ke kaushambi tak, tathaa uttar main kunala tak vihaar karne kii anumati di
 This shows that initially the propagation of Jainism was limited, and Jain Shramans could not go elsewhere except Magadha and parts of Uttar Pradesh
 nissandeh chhedsutron kaa yah bhaag utana hi pracheen he jitne swayan mahavir
 Subsequently, Jain inscriptions of Mathura, contemporary to King Kanishka, mention different ganas, clans and branches, they often coincide with the ganas, clans and branches mentioned in the Kalpasutra of Bhadarwahu
 isse bhi jain aagam granthon kii pramanikta kaa pataa chalata he
 In fact, till this time, the difference between Shwetambar and Digambar is not known in Jain tradition
 jain aagmon ke vishay, bhashaa aadi main jo pali tripitak se samanta he, vah bhi is sahitya kii pracheenta ko dyotit karti he
 Like the fables of Pali Sutras, several commentaries, commentaries, Deepika, retirement, description, Avachoori etc
 have also been written
 is sahitya ko saamanyata niryukti, bhashya, churni or tikaa-in chaar vibhaagon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he, aagam ko milakar ise 'paanchangi' ke naam se kehete hai
 Like Agama literature, this literature is also of great importance
 isamen aagmon ke vishay kaa vistaar se pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 There are many recommendations in this literature, which are historically very important
 vrihatkalpbhaashya, vyavahaarabhashya, nishithchurni, aavashyakchurni, aavashyaktikaa, uttaradhyayan tikaa aadi tikaa-granthon main puraatatv sambandhi vividh saamagree bhari padi he, jisase bharat ke reeti-rivaaj, meley tyohaar, sadhu-sampradaay, dushkaal, baadh, chor-lutere, saarthwah, vyapaar ke maarg, shilp, kala, bhojan-shaastra, makaan, aabhushan, aadi vividh vishyon par bahut prakaash padataa he
 This literature is also very important in terms of folklore and philology
 dow
 In the words of Winter- churni-sahitya main praakrit mishrit sanskrit kaa upyog kiya gaya he, jo bhashashastra kii drushti se vishesh mahatva kaa he, or saath yah us mahatvapurn kaal kaa dyotak he jab jain vidwaan praakrit kaa aashray chhodkar sanskrit bhashaa kii ore bad rahe the
 Over time, pravachansaar, Ratnarkand Shravachar, purusharth siddhupaay, Precept dhawala tikaa, Mahadhawala commentary, kasaaypahud, Jayadhavala Commentary, yogasar, Almanac barsanuvekkha, Optics ashtashti tikaa, Ashtasahri vaccine, tattwarthrajvarthik tikaa, Epistemological vaccine, samadhitantra,, Bhagwati worship, mulaachaar, Gomtsar, dravyasangrah, Bhadrabahu Samhita tattwarth sutara, acharya umaswami dwaara rachit jain granth he
 It is also called "moksha-shastra"
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya anek karkon dwaara prabhavit hoti he
 Some of its factors are external and some are internal
 iske atirikt kuch seemaabaddh kaarak bhi hote hai
 External causes are those that affect photosynthesis while being located in nature and environment such as light, carbon dioxide, temperature and water
 aantarik kaaran ve hote hai jo pattiyon main sthit hote hue prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya ko prabhavit karte hai jaise- parn harim, praras, bhojya padaarth kaa jamaav, pattiyon kii aantarik sanrachana or or pattiyon kii aayu
 In addition, photosynthesis also affects the speed of all these objects
 jab prakaash sanshleshan kii ek kriya vibhinn karkon dwaara niyantrit hoti he tab prakaash sanshleshan kii gati sabase mand kaarak dwaara niyantrit hoti he
 Whatever is less than the appropriate amount of light, carbon dioxide, water, chlorophyll etc
, it controls the speed of the whole action
 yah kaarak samay vishesh ke liye seemaabaddh kaarak kaha jaataa he
 When an action is controlled by various factors, the speed of photosynthesis is limited by the slowest factor

 bluecoman ne 1905 i

 Later it became a law whose importance is not only for photosynthesis, but also for all biochemical activities
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya kii gati prakaash, carbondioxide, jal, chlorophyl ityadi karkon dwaara niyantrit hoti he
 Whichever is less than the appropriate quantity, it controls the speed of the entire action and is called the limiting factor for that time
 kameshwar dham uttar pradesh ke baliya jile ke kaaron gram main sthit he
 It is believed that this shrine is the same place mentioned in the Shiva Purana and Valmiki Ramayana where Lord Shiva incinerated Kamdev, the commander of the gods
 yahan par aaj bhi vah aadha jala hua, haraa bharaa aam kaa vriksh he jiske peeche chhipakar kaamdev ne samadhi main leen bhagwaan shankar par pushp baan chalaaya tha

 Maharishi Valmiki has narrated in the above verses the story of Kamadeva being consumed by the third eye of Lord Shiva in the Dharmaranya
 prasang rishi vishwamitra ke saath avadhesh kumaar ram or lakshmana kaa ayodhya se byaghrasar ke siddhashram kii yatra kaa he
 The meaning of shlokas is as follows: donon mahabali rajkumaron ne praat: kaal nity-karm, tarpan or gayatri mantra kaa jap kar tapasvi vishmamitra ko pranaam kiya or aage chalane ko taiyaar hue
 Vishwamitra accompanied him to the site where there is a confluence of Ganga and Saryu

 The phenomenon of this type of waves is called diffraction
 aisa paaya gaya he ki laghu aakaar ke avarodhon se takaraane ke baad tarangen mud jaatin hai tathaa jab laghu aakaar ke chhidron se hokar tarang guzarati he to yah fail jaati he
 All types of waves cause diffraction
 yadi kisi prakashotpadak strot or parde ke bich koi apaardarshak vastu rakh di jaae, to parde par vastu kii chaaya ban jaati he
 Often the edge of the shadow is sharp and the part of the curtain around it is evenly illuminated
 yadi prakashotpadak strot binduvat chota ho, to dhyaan se dekhne par chaaya kaa kinaaraa tikshn nahin paaya jaataa he
 Streaks of light and darkness are seen on the shore
 aisa maaloom hota he ki prakaash kii kirane mudakar jyamitiya chaaya kii seemaa ke bheetar tak pahunch gai hai
 This phenomenon is called diffraction of light
 chaaya ke kinare-kinare jo dhaariyaan banati hai, unhen vivartan pattern kaha jaataa he
 Before the information of diffraction, it was believed that light moves in straight lines in any one medium
 kintu vivartan kii vyakhya prakaash ke saral raikhik gaman ke aadhaar par nahin kii ja sakati he
 Newton, Grimaldi and T
 Young first noted the incident
 newton or greemaldi prakaash ke kanika siddhant ke pravartak or anuyaayi the, at: unhone vivartan kii ghatana ko isi aadhaar par samajhane kaa asafal prayaas kiya
 The Christian hygge later proposed the wave theory of light and A
 J
 Frennel and Fraunhofer successfully explained diffraction and other phenomena related to diffraction based on this principle
 jab prakaash ke maarg main gol chhed, ytaakar rekhachhidr, kisi vastu kii tikshn kor yaa maheen taar rakhaa jaataa he, tab prayek dasha main bhinn prakaar ke vivartan pattern banate hai
 All diffraction events can be divided into two divisions: frounhophar vivartan or frenel vivartan 
 When the light source and the curtain are extremely far away from the reflecting object, that is, the plane waveform is deflected on the diffractor, then the diffraction pattern is called the Fraunhofer pattern and the phenomenon is the Fraunhofer diffraction
 jab strot, pardaa, yaa ye donon, vivartak vastu se niyat duuri par hote hai, arthath vivartak par goleey yaa belanaakaar tarangagra aaptit hota he, tab vivartan kii ghatana ko frenel vivartan kaha jaataa he
 Frennel diffraction is relatively easy to see, but difficult to understand
 frounhophar vivartan dekhne ke liye vishesh prakaar kii vyavastha kerani padati he, jisase samtal tarangagra praapt ho
 After diffraction, it has to arrange to refocus, but its principle is very simple to understand
 fronhopher vivartan:- esa vivartan jisamen prakaash shrot tathaa pardaa avarohak se anant duuri par ho
 a monochromatic light of yellow color is obtained from sodium lap
 ek lens kii sahaayta se is prakaash ko ek kaale parden main kate hue atyant sankare rekhachhidr par daalaa jaae, to yahi rekhachhidr swayan ek prakaash strot kaa kaam detaa he
 Now by putting the lens in front of this line, parallel beam is placed on each other line and white curtain is placed behind this line, then the diffraction pattern of the other line is formed on the screen
 is pattern ke bich main atyant teevr band yaa pattee hoti he
 More bandages of comparatively lesser intensity are found on both sides of this bandage
 bichwali pattee ko mukhya ucchishth tathaa anya pattiyon ko dwitiyak ucchishth kehete hai
 The diffraction pattern of two contiguous lines is somewhat different from the diffraction pattern of a line
 ek rekhachhidr ke pattern main jahaan jahaan ucchishth miltaa he, do rekhachhidr ke pattern main unheen sthanon par kai dhaariyaan banati hai, jo pehle ke bandon kii apeksha adhik patali or tikshn hoti hai
 As the number of line-holes increases, the stripes of the secondary superior attenuate and the stripes of the main superior become sharper
 rekhachhidron kii chaudaai tathaa unki parsparik duuri bhi in dhariyon kii tikshnata ko bahut prabhavit karti he
 If the lines are drawn with a diamond blade on a flat glass strip, the translucent space between each of the two lines acts as a perforation
 aise hi rekhachhidron ke samooh ko granting kehete hai
 Grating was invented by Fraunhofer
 unhone do scru ke upar maheen taar lapetakar grating banaaya tha
 The space between each two wires acts as a line defect
 aage chalakar unhone kaanch ke plate par rekhaayen khinchakar grating banaaya
 Roland created the grating line in 1882
 aajkal acchhee mashiinon dwaara ek inch par 30,000 yaa 40,000 tak rekhaayen khinchi jaati hai
 If the monochromatic parallel rays are placed on a grating by placing the lens in front of a light source, the sharpness of the diffraction is found to be several sharp lines away from each other
 ye rekhaayen vastav main rekhachhidr strot kaa vivartan bimb hoti hai
 The most intense line in the middle is called zero line
 iske donon ore pehali, duusari, teesri aadi rekhaayen kramash: pratham, dwitiya tathaa tritiy koti kii rekhaayen kehalaati hai
 If white light is applied to the grating, the zero-grade line is white, but spectrums are obtained at other places
 inhen kramash: pratham, dwitiya, tritiy aadi koti ke spectrum kaha jaataa he
 If the wavelength of the light being radiated by the grating is l, the incidence angle i and the diffraction angle q of the incident waveform and the reciprocal distance d of the midpoints of any two contiguous lines, then d d = n l hota he
 n denotes the order of the spectrum
 upar jis grating kaa vivaran diya gaya he, use samtal vivartan grating kehete hai
 If the aluminum glass is cut on a curved glass and the lines are scraped with a diamond blade, the area between each two lines acts as a tiny reflective mirror
 in bhaagon se paravartit tarangon ke vyatikaran se bhi vivartan pattern banataa he
 This grating is called concave grating
 iskaa avishkaar rolland ne kiya tha
 Concave grating also acts as a concave mirror
 at: vivartit kirnon ko foks karne ke liye lens kaa prayog nahin karnaa padataa he
 Large useful spectrographs have been created from curve grating to obtain spectrum in spectroscopy
 vakr grating ke liye bhi tarangadairghy kaa sutara d = n l hi hota he
 The ability to separate the rings of two different characters from each other is called the grafting capacity of the grating
 yadi l1- l2 = Dl ho or inke vivartan kone kramash: q1 or q2 hon tathaa q1 - q2 = Dq ho, to grating kii varna vikshepan kshamta hoti he
 Its value is derived from the formula of wavelength
 kramash: ucchtar koti main varna vikshepan kshamta badhati jaati he
 If l and l + dl are two very proximal radiation and can be seen separately from each other by grating, then dl is called the resolution of grating
 n grating par bani hui kul rekhaon kii sankhya he
 Differential capacity also increases in higher order respectively
 franelle vivartan :-esa vivartan jis main prakaash shrot tathaa pardaa avarohak yaa dwarak se simit duuri par ho
 The formation of diffraction patterns at the edge of the shadow cannot be explained by simple linear movement of light
 ise samajhane ke liye franelle ne tarang siddhant kaa upyog kiya
 To explain the effect of different points in a waveform, he proposed the principle of half-time zone
 is siddhant ke aadhaar par banaaya gaya zone plate lens kii bhanti kaam karata he or frenel ke siddhant kii pushti karata he
 If a very small hole has a monochromatic plane waveform, its diffraction pattern is formed on the screen
 is pattern main vrittakar dhaariyaan pai jaati hai
 The outermost strips are the thickest and the inner stripes are thinner respectively
 frenel ke ardhakaal zone ke aadhaar par is vivartan kii vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 If the size of the hole is equal to the first half zone and the distance between the center of the pattern and the circumference of the hole is l / 2, the center of the pattern is illuminated
 yadi parde se chhidr kii duuri sthir rakhkar chhidr kaa aakaar badhaate jaaen, to yah centre kramash: prakashit or aprakashit hota he
 When the shape of the hole covers the half-zone, the center of the pattern is bright and when the hole consists of 2m half-zone, the center is black
 chhidr ko sthir rakhkar parden ko usase sameep yaa dur laane par bhi centre par parivartan hota he
 If the distance between the center of the hole from the center of the pattern and the circumference of the hole is l / 2, the center is bright, otherwise black
 gol discs ke vivartan pattern ke centre par sarvada ek chamakili bindi banati he
 The image of a point source by an optical device is actually the diffraction pattern of the waves that pass through that device's garter
 yadi do bindu strot atyant paas paas hon, to yantra dwaara prayek kaa ek-ek vivartan pattern banataa he
 Since all optical instruments have a circular bifurcation, a circle is formed in the diffraction pattern of point sources and has many circular rings along its edges
 yantra kaa dwarak jitna hi bada hota he, vivartan pattern utane hi chote banate hai
 If the diffraction patterns of two extremely proximate point sources are made so small and clear by the optical device that the central most illuminated part of one falls on the lowest illuminated part of the other, then the central points of both can be clearly seen
 prakaashiya yantra kii is kshamta ko vibhedan kshamta kehete hai
 Often in the presence of clouds in the sky, a bright circle appears around the Sun or Moon
 ise kirit kehete hai
 Krites are formed only by the diffraction of light by tiny droplets of water
 spasht kirit ke liye nanheen boondon kaa samaakaar hona aavashyak hota he
 The smaller the droplets, the larger the diameter of the crate
 tii yang ne kiriton kaa vyas naapakar jalakanon ke vyas kii gananaa karne ke liye yantra banaaya tha, jise tantumapi kehete hai
 There is no difference in principle between diffraction and interference
 tab bhi bahudhaa yah kaha jaataa he ki vyatikaran main kuch niyat sankhya ke prakashpunjon kaa adhyaropan hone se tarang aayam ke prayek atisookshm khandon ke prabhaav kaa samakalan karke tarang kaa aayam gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The diffraction pattern of more than one line is formed by the combined effect of diffraction and interference
 sankshep main; vivartan, vyatikaran kaa hi kinchit clisht rup he
