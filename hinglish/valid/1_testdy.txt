 Often a tail has a flat top and slopes around it
 'tail' shabd kai sami bhashaaon main miltaa he, jaise ki arabi bhashaa kaa 'tral ' or ibrani bhashaa main 'tel' 
 The term is especially used in archaeological studies related to the cultures of the Middle East and North Africa

 An evil in digging the tails is that as the bottom layers are dug, the construction of the top layers collapses, losing historical information forever

 Manu has written six types of fortifications - mahabharat main yudhisthir ne jab bhishma se poocha he ki raja ko kaise poor main rahanaa chahie tab bhishma ji ne ye hi chah prakaar ke durg ginaae hai or kaha he ki poor aise hi durgon ke bich main hona chahie
 In both Manusmriti and Mahabharata, it is said to be necessary for the corpus, army, weapons, craftsmen, Brahmins, vehicles, trins, reservoir grains, etc
 to remain inside the fort

 eran main, jo gupt kaal main ek prasiddh nagar tha, kaaphi dur tak durg ke avshesh mili hai
 It is known from his study that the city was settled in such a way that the rivers serve as a trench
 teen ore se vah veena nadi se ghira hua tha, chauthi ore do anya choti nadiyaan thim, jo nagar ke pashchimi bhaag main bahati thim or chauthi ore veena nadi main girti thim
 Within this natural moat created by the rivers was the rampart of the fort which was probably made of very steep walls and there would have been high round bastions
 kautilya ke arthshaastra ke anusaar chote kilon ko sangrahan, unase bade ko dronmukh or sabase bade kilon ke do rup bataae gaye hai- The following 8 types of fortifications have been described in Someshwarcharit Manasollas - samrajyalakshmipithika main nau prakaar ke durgon kii visheshtaayen diye gayi hai

 sabase unchi chaharadivari ke bheetar mukhya durg hota tha
 Often both the city and the main fort were in the periphery of the forts
 mukhya durg ke ek ore unchi pahari yaa nadi kaa kinaaraa hota tha
 While constructing the fort, special attention was paid to protect the routes through which enemies could come into the fort or attack
 saamaanya rup se kile ke nirmaan ke liye kisi unchi pahari ko chunaa jaataa tha jisaki dhaalu chattaanon par pahunchnaa kathin hota tha
 On the side from which the enemy was expected to climb, the rocks on that side were cut and made a sloping path, which would protect it by one wall and the other hill was absolutely straight and steep

 On the outside, these wooden gates were often made of metal pointed beams, which were of different sizes and from 3 inches to 13 inches long, so that elephants would not hit and break the gate
 daravaaje ke ek pat par ek khidki bhi laga di jaati thim jo aakaar main 3 foot chaudee tathaa 4 foot unchi hoti thim
 In this window also, pointed beams were used

 In the broad sense of animal breeding, all kinds of tasks related to the production, rearing and care of animals are involved, but in a limited sense, the term is often used to improve the heredity of animals in such a way that the human need and the desired kind of advanced Animals are available
 pashuon kaa sudhaar do prakaar se kiya ja saktaa he : First by improving their environment and second by improving their heredity
 in donon main se kisi ek main hi sudhaar karne se yathochit pragati nahin ho sakati
 By improving the environment, changes in animal numbers are often very quick, but that change is not permanent and lasts only as long as the new situation persists
 kintu kisi pashusamudaay kii anuvanshakita main sudhaar dwaara parivartan praaia: mand gati se hota he, kintu vah sthaayee hota he
 Initially, the animals were able to separate such groups of animals which they considered superior to other animals
 phir unamem jo uttam hote the unka chayan kar lete the
 With this type of selection, some such animals also came out in the group in which there was a desire for animal breeding
 ab unamem se jo jaanavar prajnak ko pasand aate the unhen duusari peedi ke janak ke rup main chun lete the or yahi vidhi peedi dar peedi apanaai jaati thi
 The cattle rancher would remove unwanted elements like this and insisted on the growth of animals with desirable qualities
 kisi bhi pashuprajnan kaarykram ke antargat teen baaten aavashyak hoti hai : The first step under any breeding program is to determine what the breeder's goal is to increase the production of animals to sell in the market, or to turn botanical tools into livestock products, or a particular one
 Wants to produce animals adapted to the climate, etc
 ek hi farm main do vibhinn uddeshyon ke liye ek hi jati ke do vibhinn prakaar ke pashuon kaa paalan laabhadaayak ho saktaa he, jaise kuch ghodon kaa gaadi khinchne ke liye to kuch kaa sawari ke liye, kuch pashuon kaa paalan maance utpaadan ke liye to kuch kaa dugdh utpaadan ke liye
 It may also happen that the same type of animal has a combination of different qualities, so that two different needs can be met from the same animal
 prayek pashu ke gunon kaa aankna prajnan kaarykram ke antargat doosraa kadam he

 in gunon ke anusaar pashuon ko alag karnaa varan yaa chayan kehalaata he
 There are three types of selection: jaanwaron ko purnat: unke vyaktigat gunadosho ke aadhaar par prajnan ke liye chunanaa samooh varan, purvajon or sagotra bandhuon ke gunadosho ke aadhaar par unka chayan vanshavali athwa kul varan tathaa santati ke gundosh ke aadhaar par kisi jaanavar ke prajananaatmak gunon kaa moolyankan karnaa santati pareekshan kehalaata he
 If these three types of comparisons are compared, then each of them has its own merits
 jab kuch chure hue lakshan bahut hi vanshanugat hote hai, tab ausat santan main maan vaap kii bhanti hi ye lakshan prakat hote hai, kintu lakshan jab nune vanshanugat hote he ta ausat santan main us kul ke, jisase maan baap chune gaye the, alp maatra main gun prakat honge
 Progression by group selection depends on the intensity of selection and the average decline of the parent's total
 samooh varan dwaara praani main pratham adhik spasht parivartan hota he, kintu baad main gati dhimi pad jaati he or prabhaav kaaphi nahin hota
 The goal can be achieved by "group selection", not as much as family selection, but it does not degrade below the average singularity of parents in second-generation offspring
 parivaar varan visheshat: un gunon ke liye jo thodi maatra main anuvanshik hai, athwa jo vyaktigat jaanwaron main alag-alag nirdhaarit nahin kiye ja sakate, athwa jo kabhi maadaa main yaa kabhi nar main paae jate hai, athwa dirghajivita ke nirdhaaran ke liye joki jab tak koi praani vishesh praudh yaa vruddh nahin hota, spasht nahin hoti upyogi hota he
 Perfect family selection parivaar kii sankhya badi ho Family members have a very close relationship and tulana kiye janevaale pariwaron main se prayek parivaar ek jaisi sthiti tathaa vaataavaran main paley hon
 In horses, goats, sheep and other cattle, in which the offspring produced by a single parent is very small, family selection is not very important
 pashu jab baccha hi rahata he tabhi uske gunon ko dekhnaa hota he or tabhi santati varan laabhadaayak hota he
 But children are of low-grade heredity, or have characteristics of the same sex
 sahi sahi santati pareekshan ke liye nimnlikhit baaten aavashyak hai : It should include all the children, or at least the chosen sample also, duusare, janak se jin gunon kaa santanon ne praapt kiya ho unako baad kar diya jaay, yaa unka uchit yatharthata ke saath moolyankan ho or All the progenies who are being compared should be born in the same type of environment

 When interbred but unrelated individuals are hybridized, more life force is often displayed in the offspring than in the original livestock

 shyaam sundar das jivan ke antim kshan tak sahitya-seva main sakriy rahe
 Just before and after independence, the entire generation of Hindi grew only by sitting on Babuji's shoulders

 Looking at all this thinking, it becomes clear how they wanted to pursue Hindi literature by connecting it with many subjects

 His every minute effort to bring fresh material to the students resulted in his becoming a collector

 But it remains to be seen that his syncretic intelligence was engrossed in the material collection of many knowledge fields
 yahan tak ki vyaavhaarik-aalochana main bhi babuji ne saamanjasywad kaa saundarya sthapit kiya
 That is why comparison, historical view, interpretation, commentary etc
 entered his criticism
 is tarah hindi main vyaavhaarik-aalochana kaa aarmabhik maarg bhi unhone taiyaar kiya
 His efficient leadership later proved to be a boon for the Hindi-speaking region
 babu shyaam sundar das ne vichaaratmak tathaa bhavatmak donon hi ek prakaar ke niabandh likhe hai
 There is enough variety in the subject of his essays

 The language of Babu Shyam Sundar Das is pure literary Hindi, in which the corresponding words of Sanskrit are predominant
 bhashaa ke sambandh main unka vichaar tha- 'jab ham videshi bhaavon ke saath videshi shabdon ko grahan karen tab unhen aisa bana len ki unamem se videshipan nikal jaae or ve apane hokar hamaare vyakaran ke niyamon se anushaasit hon
 'therefore, wherever they have used the prevalent words of' Urdu 'in their language, they have removed their character, they have used them by removing the dots under the words pen, drill, law etc
 and changing their pronunciation
 isi prakaar sanskrit ke shabdon kii clishtataa dur kar ke unhen hindi main saral dhang se likhaa he- jaise- kaary ke sthaan par kaary, anjan ke sthaan par anjan
 Babu Shyamsunder Das was of the opinion about the word selection- 'the first place is the words of pure Hindi, behind it the easy and popular words of Sanskrit, behind it the simple and popular words of foreign languages like Persian and behind it the obsolete of Sanskrit
 Let the words be spaced
 farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke kathin shabdon kaa prayog kadaapi na ho
 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has written mainly in two types of styles - 1
 vichaaratmak style- vichaaratmak style main vichaaratmak niabandh likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in this style are short and expressive
 bhashaa sabal, saral or pravahamayi he
 For example- 'gopiyo kaa sneh badhaya he
 They are compiled with Krishna in Ras Leela
 anek utsav manaati he
 This behavior of Premmayi gopikas is very delightful
 usamen kahin se aswabhaaviktaa nahin aa saki
 2
 Exploratory Style - The explanatory style is used in exploratory essays
 inamen vaakya apekshaakrit kuch lambey hai
 There is a plethora of corresponding words in the language
 vishay kii gahanta tathaa shushkta ke kaaran yah style main kuch shushk or rahit he
 See an example of this type of style- 'yah jivan-sangram do bhinn sabhyataaon ke sangharshan se or bhi teevr or dukhamay prathit hone laga he
 According to this condition, when literature is generated and encouraging the brain of the society, then only the signs of real progress will be seen and its welfare will give the country the glory of modern times
 babu shyaam sundardaas kii kisi prakaar kii style main alankaaron kii sajaavat nahin pai jaati
 Sayings and idioms have been used sparingly
 apane vichaaron ko bhalee prakaar samajhane ke liye babu shyaam sundar das ne ek hi baat ko 'saransh yah he' 'athwa', 'jaise' aadi shabdon ke saath baar-baar duharaaya he
 In Hindi literature, Babu Shyam Sundar Das has been replaced as his Hindi promoter and Hindi director
 unhone anek moulik granthon kii rachana kii
 Edited many texts
 kaashi nagari-prachaarini sabha kii sthapana main unka pramukh haath tha
 He made Hindi a place in the higher classes of the university with his efforts

 1907 main unhone hindi arya bhashaa pustkaalay kii sthapana kii, pracheen mahatvapurn granthon kaa sampaadan kiya or shiksha str ke anuroop paathya pustakon kaa nirmaan kaary bhi aarambh kiya
 Ramchandra Shukla has written in the history of Hindi literature: shyaam sundar das na keval santhaan-nirmaataa the, balki prabandh-kala main bhi bejod the
 He worked determinedly to overcome the shortages of all areas of literature

 In his mind, the notion remained that the basis of the theoretical review of Hindi should be made by combining Sanskrit and Western criticism-principles and with a special harmony

 Due to the court language being Urdu, the number of newly educated Urdu readers was more, due to which the work of publishing Hindi books could not proceed

 pracheen kaal main saamaajik vyavastha ke do stambh the - varna or ashram
 On the basis of man's nature - quality, deeds and nature - mankind was classified into four varnas
 vyaktigat sanskaar ke liye uske jivan kaa vibhaajan chaar ashramon main kiya gaya tha
 These four ashrams were- brahmacharya, garhasthya, vanprastha or sanyas
 While commenting on the Amarkosh, Bhanuji Dixit explained the word 'ashram' as follows: Ashramyantyatra
 anen vaa
 Shramu Tapasi
 ghan
 Yadva and Samantachromotra swadharmasadhanklesha
 That is, in which the labor should be done in a smooth manner, it is the ashram or the ashram is the condition of life in which full work is done for performing duty
 ashram kaa arth 'avasthavishesh' 'vishram kaa sthaan', 'rishimuniyon ke rahane kaa pavitra sthaan' aadi bhi kiya gaya he
 The Ashram Sanstha had originated in the Vedic age, but it took a long time to develop and become strong
 vaidic sahitya main brahmacharya or garhasthya athwa garhapaty kaa swatantra vikaas kaa ullekh nahin miltaa
 The combined existence of these two remained for a long time and they were identified with Vaikhanas, Parvritas, Yeti, Munis, Shramans etc
 vaidic kaal main karm tathaa karmkand kii pradhanta hone ke kaaran nivrittimarg athwa sanyas ko vishesh protsaahan nahin tha
 In the final stages of Vedic literature, the Upanishads began to emphasize retirement and renunciation and it was accepted that renunciation can be achieved by being inspired by disinterest from the time in which ardent asceticism arises
 phir bhi sanyas athwa shraman dharm ke prati upeksha or anasthaa kaa bhav tha
 The four ashrams were enumerated in Sutra Yuga, though their names still differed
 aapstamb dharmasutra ke anusaar garhasthya, acharyakul, maun tathaa vanprastha chaar ashram the
 Brahmachari, householder, monk and Vaikhanas have four ashrams in Gautam Dharmasutra
 vasishthadharmasutra main grihasth, brahmacharee, vanprastha tathaa parvrajak, in chaar ashramon kaa varnan kiya he, kintu ashram kii uttpati ke sambandh main batalaaya he ki antim do ashramon kaa bhed prahlaad ke putr kapil naamak asur ne isliye kiya tha ki devataaon ko yagyon kaa prapya ansh na mili or ve durbal ho jaaen 
 This could possibly mean that the Kayakleshpradhan Nivitti Marg was earlier practiced among the Asuras and the Aryans took up this path from them in part, but still these ashrams were not fully appreciated and accepted by them
 buddha tathaa jain sudharna ne ashram kaa virodh nahin kiya, kintu pratham do ashramon-brahmacharya or garhasthya-kii anivaaryta nahin sweekaar kii
 As a result, the monks or yativasis got a big boost and there was a lot of growth of monks in society

 The prestige of the entire Ashram Dharma and the imperative of their order was also accepted
 'ashram ashraman gachhet' arthath ek ashram se duusare ashram ko janaa chahie, is siddhant ko manu ne drudh kar diya
 a detailed description of the duties of the four ashrams is found in the memories
 manu ne maanav aayu saamanyat: ek sau varsh kii maanakar usko chaar baraabar bhaagon main baanta he
 The first quadrant is Brahmacharya
 is ashram main gurukul main rahakar brahmacharya kaa paalan karnaa kartavya he
 Its main purpose is the acquisition of learning and the ritual of fasting
 manu ne brahmacharee ke jivan or uske kartavyon kaa varnan vistaar ke saath kiya 
 Brahmacharya begins with the Upanayana rite and ends with inclusion
 iske pashchaat vivaah karke munashya duusare ashram garhasthya main pravesh karata he
 Household is the pillar of society
 jis prakaar vaayu ke ashram se sabhi praani jite hai usee prakaar grihasth ashram ke sahare anya sabhi ashram vartmaan rahete hai 
 In this ashram, man is liberated from sagebrush from Vedas from Swadhyaya, from Devaruna by yajna and from ancestral birth by child birth
 isi prakaar nity panchamahaigyon-brahmayajna, devyagy, atithiyagya tathaa bhootyajna-ke anushthan dwaara vah samaaj evam sansar ke prati apane kartavyon kaa paalan karata he
 In the fourth and fifth chapters of Manusmriti, the explanation of the duties of the householder is found
 aayu kaa doosraa chaturthash garhasthya main bitaakar manushya jab dekhtaa he ki uske sir ke bal safed ho rahe hai or uske sharir par jhurriyaan pad rahi hai tab vah jivan ke tisare ashram-vanprastha-main pravesh karata he
 
 nivritti maarg kaa yah pratham charan he
 There is partial adherence to renunciation
 manushya sakriy jivan se dur ho jaataa he, kintu uske garhasthya kaa mul patni uske saath rahati he or vah yagyadi grihasthadharm kaa anshat: paalan bhi karata he
 But the renunciation of the world and yatidharma start respectively
 vanprastha ke ananthar shantchitt, paripakv vayavaale manushya kaa parvrajya prarambh hota he
 
 jaisaa pehle likhaa gaya he, pratham teen ashramon ore unke karttavyon ke paalan ke pashchaat hi manu sanyas kii vyavastha karte hai: ek ashram se duusare ashram main jaakar, jitendriya ho, bhiksha, balivaishvadev aadi se vishram paakar jo sanyas grahan karata he vah mrityu ke uparaant moksh praapt kar apni param unnati karata he 
 All the people are enlightened by the glory of that Brahman, who rises from home by giving fear to all beings
 ekaaki purush ko mukti milti he, yah samajhataa hua sanyasi siddhi kii prapti ke liye nity bina kisi sahaayak ke akelaa hi bichare; is prakaar na vah kisi ko chodta he or na kisi se choda jaataa he 
 There are signs of free male to eat skull, to remain Vrikshamul and to treat parity in all beings
 ashramavyavastha kaa jahaan shaareerik or saamaajik aadhaar he, vahaan uskaa aadhyatmik athwa darshanik aadhaar bhi he
 Indian mystics did not consider human life as mere flow and considered it to be the purpose and set its purpose and destination
 jivan ko sarthak banane ke liye unhone chaar purushaarthon-dharm, arth, kaam tathaa moksh-kii kalpana kii thi
 The first three efforts were arranged economically and the last feasibly
 moksh param purusharth, arthath jivan kaa antim lakshya tha, kintu vah aksmaat athwa kalpanamaatr se nahin praapt ho saktaa he
 For this, the development and maturity of life respectively through spiritual practice is necessary
 isi uddeshy kii purti ke liye bhartiya samajashastriyon ne ashram sanstha kii vyavastha kii
 The ashram is actually a living school or school
 brahmacharya ashram main dharm kaa ekant paalan hota he
 Brahmachari attains knowledge, scripture, learning and experience acquired from ages with Pushtshirir, Balisthabuddhi, Shantaman, Sheel, Shraddha and Vinaya
 suvinith or pavitratma hi mokshamarg kaa pathik ho saktaa he
 Religious meaning is earned and work is consumed in the family
 sansar main arth tathaa kaam ke arjan or upbhog ke anubhav ke pashchaat hi tyaag or sanyas kii bhoomika prastut hoti he
 Without abstinence, the question of renunciation does not arise
 vanprastha taiyaar hoti he
 Mokshadharma is completely followed by renouncing all the bonds of renunciation
 is prakaar ashram sanstha main jivan kaa purna udaar, kintu sanyamit niyojan tha
 There are many approaches in the scriptures regarding ashrams, which can be divided into three categories
 samucchy, vikalp or baadh
 Samkhya means proper rehabilitation of all ashrams, that is, the four ashrams should be followed properly and appropriately
 iske anusaar grihasthashram main arth or kaam sambandhi niyamon kaa paalan utana hi aavashyak he jitna brahmacharya, vanprastha evam sanyas main dharm or mokshasambandhi dharmo kaa paalan
 The biggest promoter and proponent of this theory is Manu
 duusare siddhant vikalp kaa arth yah he ki brahmacharya ashram ke pashchaat vyakti ko yah vikalp karne kii swatantraaa he ki vah garhasthya ashram main pravesh kare athwa sidhe sanyas grahan kare
 There are two types of Brahmachari mentioned in the context of inclusion
 upkurvan, jo brahmacharya samaapt kar grihasthashram main pravesh karnaa chahta tha or naishthik, jo aaajeevan gurukul main rahakar brahmacharya kaa paalan karnaa chahta tha
 Similarly, after Brahmacharya in women there were Sadyodwaha and Brahmavadini
 yah siddhant jaabalopanishad tathaa kai dharmasutron or katipay smritiyon main pratipaadit kiya gaya he
 Baadh means not accepting the independent existence or order of all the ashrams or not accepting the ashram institution itself
 gautam tathaa boudhayandharmasutron main yah kaha gaya he ki vastav main ek hi ashram garhasthya he
 His role is Brahmacharya: Schwannaprastha and Sannyas are secondary in importance
 manu ne bhi sabase adhik mahatv garhasthya kaa hi sweekaar kiya gaya he, jo sabhi karmo or ashramon kaa udgam he
 The proponents of this opinion quote in their favor the sentence of the Satapatha Brahmin, the sentence of the Isophanishad etc
 gita kaa karmyog bhi karm kaa sanyas nahin apitu karm main sanyas ko hi shreshth samajhataa he
 The biggest obstacle to the ashram institution was due to the anti-traditional Buddhist and Jain beliefs, which do not accept the set and balance of the ashram system and give great impetus to the immature sannyas or yatidhart without gaining the experience of life
 manu
 par bhashya karte hue sarvajyanarayan ne uparyukt teenon maton main samanvay karne kii cheshtaa kii he
 Generally, the theory of aggregates is valid for them
 vikalp main ve adhikarbhed maanate hai
 In his view, the principle of constraint is only for those people who, due to their preconceptions, remain lifelong in worldly pursuits and in whom there is no timely rise of conscience and disinterest
 susanghatit ashram sanstha bharatvarsh kii apni visheshta he
 But it has a very universal and classical significance
 yadhyapi aitihaasik kaarnon se iske adarsh or vyavhaar main antar rahaa he, jo maanav swabhaav ko dekhte hue swaabhaavik he, tathaapi isaki kalpana or aanshik vyavhaar apane aap main gurutv rakhte hai
 Doyson's following opinion on this subject is noteworthy: It is difficult to say how much behavior was associated with the establishment of the ashram as propounded in Manu and other theologies; But we are free to accept that in our view there is no other person in the human history of the world who can compare the dignity of this theory

 Universal directed time is the primary standard of time by which world time and watches are regularized

 The British often consider the green mean time as UTC
 samanvit saarvatrik samay vishwa ke samay kaa praathmik maanak he jiskei dwaara vishvabhar main ghadiyaan evam samay niyantrit kiye jate hai
 This Greenich is one of the many followers of the mean time

 They maintain proximity to UTC with UT1
 UT1 ausat saura samay he, jo ki greenich kii saahi vedhashala main dekha jaataa he
 The difference between UTC and UT1 cannot exceed 0

 chaaval ke paudhe prakritik rup se betaa-carotin paidaa karte hai, jo karatonoid pigment hai jo pattiyon main prakat hote hai or prakashasanshloshan main bhaag lete hai
 However, plants generally do not produce pigments in the endosperm because photosynthesis does not occur in the endosperm
 sunahale chaaval kaa nirmaan do betaa-carotin biosinthysis jin yukt chaaval ke roopantaran ke dwaara kiya jaataa he: The insertion of the gene was deemed necessary but further research revealed that it is already being produced in the wild variety of rice endosperm
 ) The PSY and CRT1 genes were mutated in the rice nuclear genome and placed under a certain endosperm promoter, so that they were expressed only in the endosperm
 The exogenous LYC gene has a transit peptide sequence attached to it to the plastid, where the formation of geranyl geranyl diphosphate occurs

 The final product of the engineered route is lycopene, but if the plant accumulates lycopene, the rice color will be red
 Recent analysis has shown that the plant's endogenous enzyme promotes lycopene in the endosperm for beta-carotene, a definite yellow color upon which it is named

 golden chaaval 2 sunahale chaaval kii tulana main 23 guna aadhik carotenoyds utpaadit karata he, tathaa betaa-carotin ko pramukhataa se sanchit karata he praapt karne ki liye, yah anumaan he ki sabase aghik paidaavaar dabaav ke 144 gra

 kisi anya kism se carotin kii jaivaupalabdhta ko kisi model main parakshit nahin kiya gaya he
 In June 2005, researcher Peter Bayer asked the Beal and Melinda Gates Foundation to further improve it by increasing the level of bioavailability of pro-vitamin A, vitamin-e, iron and zinc in golden rice and improving protein properties through genetic modification

 yah anusandhan jisane sunahare chaaval ke nirmaan kaa rasta saaf kiya, un bacchon kii madad karne ke liye kiya gaya jo vitamin e kii kami se peedit hai
 At the beginning of the 21st century, 124 million people from 118 countries in Africa and Southeast Asia were estimated to suffer from VAD
 viedi ek varsh main 1-2 million mauton, aparivarneey andhata ke 500,000 maamle tathaa shushkakshipak ke lakhon maamle ke liye jimmedaar he
 Children and pregnant women are most at risk
 vitamin e ko alag se nunatapoorak ke rup main khilaayaa jaataa he or un kshetron main use injection se diya jaataa he jahaan khaane main vitamin e kii kami hoti he
 As of 1999, 43 countries had vitamin a supplementation programs for children under 5; Of these, 10 countries had two high doses of supplementation per year, which according to UNICEF could effectively eliminate VAD
 haalanki unicef or bahut se swayamsevi santhaan anupuran main lage hue hai is baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ki
 yathasadhay baar-baar kam khuraaq kaa sampooran lakshya hona chahie
 Because in many countries where mines are deficient in vitamin A, children take rice as a complete diet, so the genetic modification of rice to produce provitamin a may be a better and less expensive alternative to vitamin supplementation
 Or increasing consumption of green vegetables or consumption of animal products can also be a good option
 ise genetic rup se abhiyantrit iodaijd namak yaa floridated pani ke samakaksh rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Preliminary analysis of the nutritional potential of golden rice suggests that consumption of golden rice will not eliminate the problem of blindness and increase in mortality, but should be seen as a supplement, like other vitamin a supplementation methods 
 Since then, improved strains of golden rice with appropriate provitamin a have been developed to reach the entire food needs of its nutrients to those who eat about 75 grams of rice per day
 vishesh rup se, chunki carotin hidropholic hote hai, isliye vitamin e kii kami ko dur karne ke yogya hone ke liye sunahale chaaval ke khaadya main samuchit vasa kaa maujuud rahanaa jaruri he
 In this context, it is important that vitamin a deficiency is rarely an isolated phenomenon, but rather is usually associated with a general lack of a balanced diet
 isliye, vitamin e ke anya prakritik sroton ke samaan jaivaupalabdhta ko grahan karne ke bare main, greenpis kaa anumaan he ki vayask manushya ko unke betaa-carotin ke ardio ko praapt karne ke liye pehali nasl kaa pakaaya hua lagbhag 9 kilogram sunahalaa chaaval khaane kii jarurat he, jabaki ek stanpan karaane vaali mahila ko dugani maatra kii aavashyaktaa hogi, ek asantulit bhojan kaa prabhaav puri tarah se jimmedaar nahin hota
 duusare shabdon main, vitamin e kii kami ko ghataane yaa kam karne ke liye bhautik rup se paryaapt mul sunahale chaaval ko paidaa karnaa or saath hi khaanaa donon hi lagbhag asambhav he
 Although this claim is related to the golden rice prototype cultivar, more recent versions have relatively higher properties of vitamin A
 potricus ne kisaanon ko nirvaah ke liye muft main sunahale chaaval ko vitarit karne ke prayaas main agrani bhoomika nibhaai thi
 This required several companies that had intellectual property rights over Bayer's research to license it for free
 bear ne european ayog 'carotin plus' anusandhan kaarykram se dhan praapt kiya tha, dhan praapt karne ke liye kanoonee taur par yah jaruri tha ki ve apane avishkaar ke adhikaar kaarykram kii karporate praayojak, geneka ko saunp den
 bear or potricus ne sunahalaa chaaval banane ke liye 32 vibhinn companiyon or vishvavidhyalayon ke 70 bauddhik sampada adhikaron kaa istemaal kiya
 They needed to establish free licenses for all of these so that Syngenta and other human partners of the project could use golden rice in the breeding program and develop new crops
 muft license, tathakthith maanviya upyog license ko ek sakaaratmak prachaar, khaskar july 2000 main tim patrika main, ki sunahalaa chaaval bana liya gaya he, ke kaaran jaldi hi manjuuri mil gayi
 Golden rice is said to be the first genetically modified crop that was logically beneficial and thus gained widespread acceptance
 Monsanto was the first company to approve a group free license
 samooh ko bhi maanviya or vanijyik istemaal ke bich ke vibhaajan ko paribhaashit karnaa padataa tha
 The figure was set at $ 10 000 USD
 isliye, jab tak ek kisaan yaa sunahale chaaval genetics kaa anuvarthi prayokta prati varsh $10 000 se zyada nahin kama letaa tha, tab tak vanijyik upyog ke liye singenta ko koi roylty nahin deni padati thi
 There is no charge for the human use of golden rice and farmers are allowed to keep seeds and re-plant
 anuvaanshik rup se abhiyantrit fasalon ke aalochakon ne vibhinn chintaaen vyakt kii hai
 One of these is that golden rice basically does not have enough vitamin A
 is samasya kaa samaadhaan chaaval kii nai kism kaa vikaas kar kiya gaya he
 However, the speed of erosion of vitamin a at the time of harvesting of the plant and how much remains after ripening is still in doubt
 greenpis ne anuvaanshik rup se sanshodhit sabhi jeevon kaa virodh kiya or mat vyakt kiya ki sunahalaa chaaval vah trogen ghoda he jo gmos ke adhik vyapak upyog kaa darwaja khol degaa
 Vandana Shiva, an Indian anti-gmo activist, argues that the problem is not that there is a deficiency in that particular crop, but rather that the poor have a problem of inefficiency and that food crops lack biodiversity
 in samasyaon ko anuvaanshik rup se sanshodhit khaadya padaarthon par aadhaarit krishi ke karporate niyantran dwaara badhaayaa gaya he
 Vandana Siva argues that by focusing on a narrow problem, the proponents of the Golden Rice hide a major issue of widespread lack of availability of various sources of nutritional food
 anya samoohon kaa kahana he ki vitamin e se samrudh vibhinn khaadya padaarth jaise ki kand, patteydaar hari subjiyan or fal bacchon ko paryaapt vitamin e pradaan kar sakate hai
 Due to a lack of factual studies and uncertainty about how many people will use golden rice, who's malnutrition expert Francisco Branca concludes that "providing supplements, strengthening vitamin A-rich foods, and giving people carrots or something Teaching to grow certain leafy vegetables is the best way to fight the problem "

 Acids are substances that are sour in taste when dissolved in water, turn a roly made from turmeric to yellow, and their aqueous solution turns blue litmus paper red
 adhikansh dhaatuon par abhikriya karke hydrogen gas utpann karte hai, or ksharak ko udasin kar dete hai

 While studying the properties of oxygen, Lavazi observed that when the elements like carbon, sulfur and phosphorus are burned in oxygen, the oxides made from them form acids with water
 ve is parinaam par pahunche ki amlon main oxygen rahata he or amlon kii amleeyta kaa kaaran oxygen he
 For this reason, this gas was named "oxygen", which means "acidifier" and for this reason, in the German language, Oxygen is called "sire stuff"
 lavaazie ne hi amlon ko do virgon, acarbonic amalon or carbonic amlon main vibhakt kiya tha
 It was seen that oxides of some elements dissolve in water to form not alkalis but alkalis and some acids do not contain oxygen at all
 bertile ne san 1787 main hydrosienic amla, davy ne san 1810-11 main hydrochloric amla or san 1813 main hydrodic amla kaa avishkaar kiya
 There is no oxygen in any of them
 aage chalakar dekha gaya he ki jo padaarth bilkul sookhe hote hai, unamem koi amleey abhikriya nahin hoti
 Then people divided the acids into two classes, one hydro-acid and the other oxy-acid
 peeche san 1815 main davy ne suzav rakhaa ki amlon kii amleeyta oxygen ke kaaran nahin, varan hydrogen ke kaaran he
 Dulang studied oxalic acid in 1815 and came to the conclusion that there is no difference between oxygenated and non-oxygenated acids
 amlon main koi aisa gun nahin he jise ham amlon kaa vishisht lakshan kah saken
 Common properties have been stated above
 amla or dhaatu kii abhikriya main amla ke anu kaa ek, yaa ek se adhik, hydrogen parmaanu dhaatuon, dhaatuon ke oxidon, hydroxidon athwa carboneton se visthapit ho jaataa he
 There are also some acids that are sweet instead of sour
 aisa ek amla amido-fosphrik amla he
 There are some acids which are not alkaline
 kuch aise bhi kshar hai jinka hydrogen dhaatuon se visthapit ho jaataa he
 Alum is not acid
 isamen visthapit honevaala koi hydrogen bhi nahin he
 But it is sour in taste and alkali in action
 yah nile litmus ko laal bhi kar detaa he
 Similarly sodium bisulfide is sour and alkali
 yah nile litmus ko laal karata he
 It also has displacing hydrogen, but it is not acid
 mithen amla nahin he, par iskaa hydrogen jaste se visthapit ho jaataa he or is prakaar zinc diemethil banataa he jo lavan nahin he
 Therefore, no satisfactory definition of acid has yet been given
 aayan siddhant ke aadhaar par yadi ham amlon kii paribhaasha dena chahen to kah sakate hai ki amlon main hydrogen yanon kaa rahanaa atyaavashyak he
 In 1659, Silvian first differentiated into acids and bases
 rule ne san 1774 main ksharak naam us padaarth ko diya jo amlon ke saath milakar lavan banaata he
 Nowadays, bases are those oxygen-rich substances that are supplemented by acids
 kshar dhaatuon, kshariyamruda dhaatuon or anya dhaatuon ke oxide or ve sabhi vastuen ksharak hai jo amlon ke saath milakar lavan banaati hai
 Initially the base was applied only to metals or oxides of metals that were "bases" or bases of salts
 lavenon ke ksharak aavashyak avyav hai
 Bases are actually substances that combine with acids to form salts and water
 udhaahrant:, zinc oxide salphurik amla ke saath milakar zinc sulphate or jal banaata he
 Dahk soda combines with sulfuric acid to form sodium sulfate and water
 dhaatuon ke oxide saamanyat: ksharak hai
 But there are exceptions to this
 ksharakon main dhaatuon ke oxide or hydraksaide hai, par suvidha ke liye tatwon ke kuch aise samooh bhi rakhe gaye hai jo amlon ke saath milakar bina jal bane hi lavan banaate hai
 Among such bases are ammonia, hydroxylamine and phosphine
 drav ammonia ghul jaataa he par phinolfaileen se koi rang nahin detaa
 Thus, to what extent can it be called base, this thing is doubtful
 yadhyapi upar kii ksharak kii paribhaasha badi asantoshprad he, tathaapi isse acchhee paribhaasha nahin di ja saki he
 Base and base are not synonyms
 sab kshar ksharak hai par sab ksharak kshar nahin hai
 Alkali-metal oxides, such as sodium oxide, dissolve in water to form hydroxides

 Oxides and hydroxides of metals are basic
 kshar dhaatuon ke oxide jal main sheeghra ghul jate hai
 Oxides of some metals are less soluble in water and oxides of some metals are not soluble even in water
 kuch adhaatuon ke hydride, jaise nitrogen or phosphorus ke hydride bhi bhasma hote hai

 The "planetary Circle" is called "planetary System" in English and "nizam Kaukabi" in arabic-persian

 In modern astronomy, it is believed that when a cloud of molecules in space starts collapsing with gravity, it makes an adyagraha circle around a star
 pehle anu jamaa hokar dhul ke kan bana dete hai, phir kan milakar dale ban jate hai
 Due to the constant impact of gravity, these pulses cause collisions and congestion and gradually become large pieces of debris that form planets, satellites and separate objects simultaneously over time
 jo vastuen badi hoti hai unka gurutvkarshan taaqatvar hota he or ve apane-aap ko sikodkar ek gole kaa aakaar dhaaran kar leti hai
 These planets and satellites sometimes collide in the first stages of the creation of a planetary circle, which sometimes causes them to break and sometimes become larger
