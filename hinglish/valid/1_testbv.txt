5 crore new voters have been created during the revision of electoral rolls across the country

 Director General of Election Commission Akshay Raut said that it is a 'great effort' to connect qualified voters of the entire country with the electoral system
 chunaav ayog ne yah prayaas tab shuru kiya jab usne mahasoos kiya ki desh kaa yuva varg chunaav prakriya main batch chadh kar hissaa nahin letaa
 Raut said that going into the bottom of the reasons for the low share of youth in the election process, it was found that the registration of the voters of 18 to 19 years is only ten to fifteen percent
 yani ek janvari ko is umr varg main jitne bachche aate hai unamem se maatr das se pandrah fisadi bachche hi matadaata ke rup main panjikrut hote hai
 He said that today the number has reached about 35 to 40 percent
 naye matadaataaon ko jodne kii disha main yah ek badi chalaang hai

 Sunday was not a good day for the passengers of Air India
 darasal air india kii do flite ke yatriyon ko udaan se pehle hone vaale payalat ke brith anelizer test kii vajah se dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In one flight, the pilot forgot to get the breath test, then the flight had to be recalled while in the second flight the pilot failed twice in the breath test
 ek maamla flite eai-111 kaa he, jise dilli se landan janaa tha
 But failing the breath test, Air India Director (operations) Captain AK Kathpalia was stopped from flying the aircraft
 airlines sutron ke anusaar air india ko unke sthaan par duusare payalat ko bulaanaa padaa
 The plane then departed with a delay of 55 minutes
 isse yatriyon ko asuvidha bhi hui
 In the past, many such cases have come up
 pitiai ke anusaar, airlines ke adhikari ne kaha, 'hamane captain e ke kathpalia ko udaan bharne se roak diya kyonki vah do baar breath analizer pareekshan main vifal rahe the
 He was to take a flight from New Delhi to London, but he failed the pre-flight breath test
 ' adhikari ne kaha, 'unhen ek or mauka diya gaya lekin doosraa pareekshan bhi positive paaya gaya jiske baad unhen udaan par jane se roak diya gaya'
 Second case: The second case of flight back is of flightai-323, which was to go to Bangkok from Delhi
 yah flite apane tay samay se aadhe ghante deree se udi, lekin aadhe ghante baad hi is flite ko waapas bulaanaa padaa
 It is being told that the pilot of this flight forgot to get the breath test, after which this step had to be taken
 vahiin yatriyon ko is baat kii koi jaankaree nahin di gai
 What is the rule? Rule number 24 of the Aircraft Manual prohibits crew members from consuming any type of alcoholic beverages 12 hours before the start of the flight
 saath hi niyam ke anusaar, udaan shuru hone se pehle or baad main chaalak dal ke sadasyon ko brith test se guzarana anivaary hota he
 For the first time such a violation causes the flight license to be canceled for three months as per the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) rules
 duusari baar niyam kaa ulanghan karne par license teen saal ke liye nilambit kar diya jaataa he or teesri baar aisa hone par use sthaayee rup se radd kar diya jaataa he
 Earlier in 2017, Kathpalia's flight license was suspended for three months by the DGCA for not conducting Breath Analyzer test before flight
 baad main unhen kaaryakari nideshak, sanchaalan ke pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 Later he was appointed to the post of Director (operations) in Air India Limited for a period of five years

 During the election, following all the limitations, we contested on the basis of issues and went into the election campaign on whatever work we did
 lekin jo haar hui he uski naitik jimmedaari lete hue maine rajyapal ko apana istipha de diya he’
 He said, 'the election results that have come will be analyzed later, but the results of the elections in Bihar indicate that the polarization on the communal line is not good for democracy

 They knew that most of the CCTV installed in the area is bad, but still their pictures were captured in a CCTV, which made them very upset, so for a long time they did not even try to sell the goods

 BSP national president Mayawati today said that the bjp's 'nirbhay Yatra' to go to Kairana in western Uttar Pradesh and in response to the ruling sp's 'sadbhavana Yatra' was a result of mutual complicity and said that its objective is communal before the upcoming assembly elections
 Rioting is to gain electoral benefits
 mayawati ne shuukravaar ko jari ek bayaan main kaha ki vaise to kairana se kathith palaayan ke maamle ko bhaajapa sampradayik rang dene ke saath-saath uskaa galat raajnneetik laabh uthaane ke liye kaaphi jor lagaae hue he, lekin sapa sarkaar bhi raaj dharm ko bhuulakar aise tatwon ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kar rahi he
 He said that the BSP demands that strict action should be taken immediately against those who incite the incitement
 varanaa uttar pradesh ek baar phir sampradayik dange kii aag main jalegaa jisaki puri jimmedaari sapa or uski sarkaar kii hogi
 The BSP president termed the suspension of Senior Superintendent of Police Anant Dev in the case of beating up of an SP leader at the police station in Gorakhpur as an improper step and said that the SP government has completely surrounded Jungle Raj
 aisa lagata he ki centre bhaajapa sarkaar kii tarah hi pradesh kii sapa sarkaar bhi galat, jativaadee evam pakshpaati maansikta se kaam karte huye un sabhi adhikariyon ko dandit kar rahi he jo kanoon ke anusaar nishpakshta se kaam karne kaa thodaa bhi saahas kar rahe hai
 He said that the fault of the senior superintendent of police of Gorakhpur district was that his police had tried to stop the bullying and bullying of an SP leader
 kya is prakaar ke galat kaaryon se pradesh kii kanoon-vyavastha kabhi bhi behatar ho paaegi
 Mayawati said that this is another example which shows that officers are not able to run ahead of sp's goons, miscreants, mafias, chaotic, criminal and communal elements
 gujarat ke ishrat jahaan muthbhed maamle main kuch filon ke gaayab hone se sambandhit grih mantralay kii jaanch ke bare main media main chhapi report kaa hawala dete huye basapa pramukh ne kaha ki isse bhi yah spasht ho jaataa he ki centre sarkaar samvedansheel maamalon main bhi sahi niyat se kaam nahin kar rahi he
 The political use of central government agencies and ministries is wrong and such malicious politics should not be done
 tippaniyan Mayawati said that an example of this has also come to light in the case of Hyderabad-based Dalit student Rohit Vemula
 jise is had tak pratadit kiya gaya ki use aatmahatya tak ke liye majaboor hona padaa or use aaj tak insaaf bhi nahin mil paaya
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) In a statement released on Friday, Mayawati said that while giving BJP communal color to the case of alleged migration from Kairana, along with its political gains, it is very much in force, but the SP government too forgets the Raj Dharma and such elements Is not taking any action against unhone kaha ki basapa kii maang he ki bhadakaane kaa kaam karne waalon ke khilaaf tatkaal sakht karrwai kii jaye
 Otherwise, Uttar Pradesh will once again burn in the fire of communal riots, which will be solely responsible for the SP and its government
 basapa adhyaksh ne gorakhpur main ek sapa netaa kii thane main pitayee ke maamle main varisht police adheekshak anant dev ke nilamban ko anuchit kadam bataate huye kaha ki sapa sarkaar puure taur par jangalraj se ghir chuki he
 It seems that the SP government of the state, like the central BJP government, is acting with a wrong, casteist and biased mindset and punishing all those officers who are having a little courage to work impartially according to the law
 unhone kaha ki gorakhpur jile ke varisht police adheekshak kaa kasoor sirf itnaa tha ki unki police ne ek sapa netaa kii gundai or dabangai ko rokane kii koshish kii thi
 Will the law and order of the state ever be improved by such wrong actions
 mayawati ne kaha ki yah ek or udhaaharan he jisase pataa chalata he ki sapa ke gundon, badmaashon, mafiaon, arajak, aapraadhik or sampradayik tatwon ke aage adhikariyon kii bilkul bhi nahin chal paa rahi he
 Referring to a report published in the media about the Home Ministry investigation related to the disappearance of some files in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case of Gujarat, the BSP chief said that this also makes it clear that the central government has the right intentions in sensitive cases as well Is not working with kendriya sarkari agenciyon evam mantralayon kaa raajnneetik istemaal galat he or aisi dweshpurn raajnneeti nahin kerani chaiye
 The comments mayawati ne kaha ki iskaa ek udhaaharan hyderabad ke dalit chaatr rohit vemula ke maamle main bhi jag-jaahir ho chukaa he
 Who was tortured to such an extent that he was forced to commit suicide and could not get justice till date

 Yes! There is an ancient temple named 'kukurdev' in Khapri village in Durg district of Chhattisgarh
 is mandir main kisi devi-devtaa kii nahin balki kute kii puja hoti he
 It is said that visiting this temple does not cause a whooping cough and there is also no fear of dog bite

 The dogs had seen where the thieves were hiding those things
 subah kutta sahuukaar ko us jagah par le gaya jahaan chori kaa saamaan tha
 Happy with this, Sahukar mentioned the incident on a paper and tied it to the dog's neck and freed him to go to his rightful owner
 jab banjaare ne kute ko waapas aate dekha to gusse main use maar daalaa
 Banjara then read the paper tied around the dog's throat

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will once contest from the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh in the political arena
 narendra modi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kaashi se utarkar purvanchal main vipakshi dalon kaa safaya kar diya tha
 But this time Narendra Modi's path in Kashi's battle does not look as easy as in the previous elections
 sapa-basapa-areldi jahaan ek taraf gathbandhan ke taur par ummidavaar utarkar modi ko gherne kii kavayad main hai
 At the same time, after the entry of Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi in Kashi, the political situation seems to have changed
 aise main narendra modi ke liye kaashi main vipakshi chakravyuuh ko bhednaa chunauti hogi, kyonki varansi ke saath-saath purvanchal ke kile ko bhi fatah karne kaa daaromadar unheen ke kandhon par tikaa hua he
 Let us know that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the SP, BSP and Congress were completely wiped out completely by contesting from the Varanasi seat of UP
 azamgarh kii sansadeey seat chhodkar baaki purvanchal kii sabhi siton par bijepi camel khilaane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 The BSP and Congress could not even open their account in Purvanchal
 lekin is baar ke varanasi se lekar purvanchal tak kii siyaasi jameen ke halaat badale hue hai
 SP-BSP alliance formed challenge: The SP-BSP-RLD alliance is looking for a candidate who fits the political and ethnic equation in order to surround Narendra Modi in Varanasi
 itnaa hi nahin wo modi ko kadi chunauti bhi dene kii koshish main hai, kyonki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa or basapa ke ummidavaaron kii jamaanat bhi nahin batch saki thi
 Although both parties contested separate elections, but this time the two parties have decided to enter the fray
 priyanka factor kaa kaise saamana karegi bijepivahin, congress ne priyanka gandhi ko purvanchal kaa prabharee banaakar ek bada daanv chalaa he
 Priyanka Gandhi made her first tour of the Lok Sabha election campaign for Purvanchal on Monday from Prayagraj to Varanasi
 is dauraan wo ganga nadi main boat ke sahare pahunchin
 On the way, she reached Kashi, bowing at the temple and tomb, and communicating with the people living on both sides of the Ganges
 priyanka kii varanasi main entry ke baad raajnneetik halaat badale hue najar aa rahe hai
 The way Priyanka has raised the questions and raised questions directly about Narendra Modi in Varanasi
 isse saaf he ki congress modi ke khilaaf baari bharkam pratyaashee utaarne kaa man bana chuki he
 In such a situation, all eyes are on the next step of the Congress
 varanasi kaa jaateey samikarnavaranasi loksabhaa seat par saatven charan main vot daale jaaenge
 Looking at the caste equation here, the Brahmin, Vaishya and Kurmi voters are in a very decisive role
 kareeb teen lakh vaisya, dhai lakh kurmi, dhai lakh brahman, teen lakh muslim, 1 lakh 30 hajaar bhoomihaar, 1 lakh rajput, paune do lakh yadav, 80 hajaar chaurasia, ek lakh dalit or ek lakh ke kareeb anya obisi matadaata hai
 However, the BJP has formed an alliance with Anupriya Patel's Apna Dal (S) to try the Kurmi vote once again
 jatigat lihaaj se is seat par savarna vot bank asardaayak mana jaataa he
 The way the picture changed in 2014 after Narendra Modi became a candidate, it is not hidden from anyone
 bijepi ko vaisya, baniyon or vyapaariyon kii party mana jaataa he
 However, the challenge is bigger this time
 ek to pichde or dalit matadaata par gathbandhan kii najar he
 The Congress is trying to break into the Kurmi vote bank with the help of another faction of Apna Dal
 brahman or ati pichhadi jatiyon par bhi uski najar he
 In such a situation, the battle will not be as easy this time

 is din nae bahiyon par 'shri' likhakar kaary prarambh kiya jaataa he
 On this day, if cousins, mummies, puffers or any sister feeds brother with his hand, then his age increases

 Kayasthas worship Chitragupta on the day of Bhaiyuduj
 chitragupta puja subah 6:35 se 7:30 baje tak or lekhnee kii puja subah 11:45 se dopaher 1:30 baje tak kii ja sakati he
 The method of worshiping Chitragupta is also very easy
 
 
 - puja sthaan ko saaf kar ke ek kapadaa bicha kar vahaan chitragupta ji kii photo rakhen
 - By lighting the lamp, worship Ganesha with sandalwood, roli, turmeric, Akshat
 - chitragupta ji ko bhi chandan, roli, haldi, akshat laga karpujakaren
 After this, offer panchamrit made of fruits, sweets, betel nuts and milk, ghee, ginger, jaggery and Ganges water
 - ab parivaar ke sabhi sadsy apni kitaab, kalam kii puja kar chitragupta ji ke saamne rakh den
 After this, make a swastika on the Ekkhedkagaj and offer it to Chitragupta by offering details of his income and expenditure on it
 paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne paris main somvaar ko amir deshon ko jhakzorne ke liye film 'tajmahal' kaa mashhoor gane kaa istemaal kiya, 'jo vaada kiya wo nibhaana padegaa
 
 
 
 ' jaavdekar ne kaha ki chennai jaisi aapadaaen jahaan-jahaan hoti hai or jahaan jalwaayu parivartan ke asar ko kam kiya ja saktaa he, vahaan vishwa main aise deshon ko muaavja milanaa chahie
 At present, there is no mechanism for this and what happened is half-incomplete
 yahaan paris main sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya chennai main hui barbaadi or tabaahi ke liye jalwaayu parivartan zimmedaar he? jaankaar yahi kah rahe hai ki aisi ghatnaayen climet change kaa hi nateeja hai or isaki vajah he global varming jo mukhya rup se america or european deshon ke dwaara vaataavaran main failaae gaye carbon kii vajah se he
 At the ongoing climate change conference in Paris, the fight over this has intensified
 jahaan america or european union garib or vikasshil deshon se los and damege ke liye paise na maangane ko kah rahe hai, vahiin bharat ne bhi amir deshon se saafe kah diya he ki kam se kam climet finance ke maamle main america jaise deshon ko apana vaada puraa karnaa padegaa or is baar jhootha dilasa nahin chalegaa
 The truth is that on the one hand, natural disasters are coming due to the constantly warming earth, on the other hand, countries like India have not made any special preparations for this
 isse nibatane ke liya dher sara paisa chahie, jisaki maang amir deshon se kii ja rahi he
 Experts say that India is very serious about the demand for compensation and that is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned it in his speech here

 Loss damage and climate finance are important points to be debated and it is important to keep an eye on it, as it will be interesting to see how many countries India is able to mobilize with it
 yahaan paris main sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya chennai main hui barbaadi or tabaahi ke liye jalwaayu parivartan zimmedaar he? jaankaar yahi kah rahe hai ki aisi ghatnaayen climet change kaa hi nateeja hai or isaki vajah he global varming jo mukhya rup se america or european deshon ke dwaara vaataavaran main failaae gaye carbon kii vajah se he
 At the ongoing climate change conference in Paris, the fight over this has intensified
 jahaan america or european union garib or vikasshil deshon se los and damege ke liye paise na maangane ko kah rahe hai, vahiin bharat ne bhi amir deshon se saafe kah diya he ki kam se kam climet finance ke maamle main america jaise deshon ko apana vaada puraa karnaa padegaa or is baar jhootha dilasa nahin chalegaa
 The truth is that on the one hand, natural disasters are coming due to the constantly warming earth, on the other hand, countries like India have not made any special preparations for this
 isse nibatane ke liya dher sara paisa chahie, jisaki maang amir deshon se kii ja rahi he
 Experts say that India is very serious about the demand for compensation and that is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned it in his speech here
 lekin paris main amir desh kuch or hi kahani kah rahe hai
 He says that developing countries do not have the right to ask for compensation for a disaster like Chennai

 But the rich countries in Paris are telling a different story
 unka kahana he ki vikasshil deshon ko chennai jaisi kisi aapadaa ke liye koi muaavja maangane kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Harjeet Singh, International Policy Manager, Action Aid, says, "these disasters are happening because of climate change
" unki ham taiyaari kaise karen
 
 
 In which we talk about early warning system or planning to evacuate people
 isamen ek mudda he los and damege kaa yani jo ye tabahiyaan ho rahi hai, jaise hamane chennai main dekhi uttarakhand main dekhi yaa odisha main dekhi
 
 
 Compensation is being sought for that
 usase in deshon ko pareshaani ho rahi he, kyonki unhen maaloom he ki ye maamla kai billian dollar main jane vaala he
 Comments isiilie dabaav banane ke liye bharat ne saaf kar diya he ki hameshaa kii tarah is baar amir deshon kii nahin chalegi
 On the question of the help of money, Javadekar said that it is said here that what we promised will have to be fulfilled
