 [7 9 Integrated circuit or monopoly in electronics) is also known as micropath, microchip, silicon chip, or just chip
 yah ek ardhchaalak padaarth ke andar bana hua electronic paripath hi hota he jisamen pratirodh, sandharitra aadi pasive component ke alaava diod, trangistor aadi ardhchaalak avyav nirmit kiye jate hai
 Just as a normal circuit is constructed by adding different components, the IC is not constructed by making all the components within a semiconductor follow a specific process simultaneously
 ekikrut paripath aajkal jivan ke har kshetra main upyog main laaye ja rahe hai
 Due to these, the size of electronic devices has become very small, their working capacity has become very high and their power requirement has been reduced
 sankar ekikrut paripath bhi laghu aakaar ke ekipari hote hai kintu ve alag-alag avyavon ko ek chote board par jodakar evam apoxi aadi main jadkar banaaye jate hai
 Hence they are different from monolithic ics
 sookshmchip, ekipari kii ek chip hoti he, jo ki silicon se bani hoti he
 This program is made for logic and computer memory
 vartmaan main sookshmchip computer, mobile, pidie or microwave oven sahit kai electronic upkarnon kaa aavashyak ang ban chuki hai
 Microchip has completed its 50-year journey
 1958 main iskaa avishkaar robert nois or jaik kilbe ne kiya tha
 Both of them worked in different companies and both companies were doing this research from their perspective
 is shodh ke uparaant baad donon hi companiyon ne iske patent ke liye aavedan kiya
 Later both companies were jointly licensed and its joint patents were granted
 pehali baar sookshmchip 1961 main logon ko uplabdh hui
 Jick Kilbey later invented the portable calculator
 tab se lekar ab tak sookshmchip main kai badlaav aa chuke hai
 While the first microchip had a transistor, a capacitor and three registers, today's microchip contains about 125 million transistors in a small space
 sookshmchip ke kai or laabh bhi hai
 Microchip is currently used in biological systems
 iskaa prayog jivan bachaane main bhi hone laga he
 Pacemakers also have microchip for heart patients

 san 1947 main transistor ke avishkaar ke baad ekipari ke vikaas kaa rasta saaf ho gaya tha
 In 1958-59, two persons developed almost the same type of IC almost at the same time
 ve alag-alag kaam kar rahe the or ek-duusare ke kaam se anbhigya the
 These individuals were Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce, co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation
 dono hi vidyut ejeeniyar the or dono hi is baat kaa hal nikaalane main jute hue the ki anekanek sankhyaon vaale paripathon ko kaise vishwasaneey rup se nirmit kiya jaay or unka aakaar kaise chota kiya jaay
 Today we can say that if the transistor had not been invented, it would not have been incompatible; And if it were not integrated, there would not be computers and other electronic devices whose circuit is made up of billions of components
 ekipari ke vikaas se nimnlikhit laabh hote hai- Integrated circuits are divided into three parts based on the nature of the circuit inside them - digital ekikrut paripathon ko unamem prayukt transistoron kii sakhya ke aadhaar par small scale integrated, medium scale integrated, large scale integrated, veri large scale integrated, ultra large scale integrated aadi main baanta jaataa he
 In the initial days there were only a few transistors inside the IC

 Narendra Kohli is a famous Hindi litterateur
 kohli ji ne sahitya ke sabhi pramukh vidhaon evam gaun vidhaon or aalochanatmak sahitya main apni lekhnee chalaai he
 He has created centuries of great texts
 hindi sahitya main 'mahakavyatmak upanyaas' kii vidha ko prarambh karne kaa shrey narendra kohli ko hi jaataa he
 Kohli's other specialty is solving problems of mythological and historical characters and presenting modern social problems and their solutions to the society through them
 kohliji saanskrithik rashtravaadi sahityakar hai, jinhone apni rachanaaon ke madhyam se bhartiya jivan-style evam darshan kaa samyak parichay karavaaya he
 In January 2017, he was honored with the Padma Shri
 narendra kohli kaa janm 6 janvari 1940 ko sanyukt punjab ke sialkot nagar me hua tha jo ab pakistan me he
 Elementary education started in Lahore and after the partition of India, the family moved to Jamshedpur
 dilachasp he ki praarambhik avasthaa main hindi ke is sarvakalik shreshth rachanaakaar kii shiksha kaa madhyam hindi na hokar urdu tha
 He got the Hindi subject only after the Class x examination
 vidhyaarthee ke rup main narendra atyant medhaavi the evam achche ankon se uteern hote rahe
 vaad-vivaad pratiyogitaaon main bhi unhen anek baar anek pratiyogitaaon main pratham sthaan praapt hua
 Later, he also got a postgraduate and doctorate degree from Delhi University
 prasiddh aalochak dow nagendra ke nirdesan main "hindi upanyaas : srijan evam siddhant" is vishay par unka shodh prabandh purna hua
 It is only in this preliminary work that young Narendra Kohli's penetrating vision and the power to take hold of the basic elements are revealed
 1963 se lekar 1995 tak unhone dilli vishvavidhyalay me adhyaapan kaary kiya or vahiin se 1995 main purnakalik lekhan kii swatantraaa praapt karne ke liye svaichhik avkaash grahan kiya
 Often, after evaluating the literary contribution of Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi after six-seven decades, a major fact can now be added to it
 acharya dvivedi ne hindi sahitya main ek aise dwaar ko kholaa jisase guzar kar narendra kohli ne ek sampoorn yug kii pratishtha kar daali
 yah hindi sahitya ke itihaas kaa sabase ujjwal prishth he or is naveen prabhaat ke pramukh vaitalik hone kaa shri avashya hi acharya dvivedi kaa he jisane yuva narendra kohli ko prabhavit kiya
 One can think from the original point of view on the insistence of clear and well-reasoned argument without being influenced by traditional ideology and characterization
 This is the feature which was laid by Acharya Dwivedi and the Ramkatha, Mahabharata story
 And it is the credit of Acharya Narendra Kohli for erecting grandiose titles of Krishna-stories etc
 sankshep main kaha jaae to bhartiya samskruti ke mul swar acharya dvivedi ke sahitya main pratidhwanit hue or unki anugunj hi narendra kohli rupi paanchajnya main samaa kar samskruti ke krishnodghosh main parivartit hui jisane hindi sahitya ko hilaa kar rakh diya
 In the modern era, Narendra Kohli gave voice to theistic values in literature
 san 1975 main unke ramakatha par aadhaarit upanyaas 'diksha' ke prakaashan se hindi sahitya main 'saanskrithik punarjagran kaa yug' prarambh hua jise hindi sahitya main 'narendra kohli yug' kaa naam dene kaa prastaav bhi jor pakadta ja rahaa he
 In the era of immediate darkness, despair, corruption and pricelessness, Narendra Kohli chose a classics character who was alive in Indian Manisha's romance
 mahakavy kaa zamana biit chukaa tha, sahitya ke 'katha' tatva kaa samvahak ab padya nahin, gadhy ban chukaa tha
 The manner in which young Kohli embodied the much-hyped Ramkatha as a novel on the strength of his classical talent, has now become a golden page in the history of Hindi literature
 yugon yugon ke andhkaar ko chirakar unhone bhagwaan ram kii katha ko bhaktikaal kii bhavukta se nikaal kar aadhunik yatharth kii jameen par khadaa kar diya
 saahitiyik evam pathak varg chamatkrit hi nahin, abhibhoot ho gaya
 How a neglected and exiled prince buries new life in his power of exploited, afflicted and stricken people, it was nothing short of a miracle to be seen in 'abhyudaya'
 yug-ugantar se rudh ho chuki ramakatha jab aadhunik pathak ke ruchi-sanskaar ke anusaar bilkul nae kalevar main dhalakar jab saamne aayi, to yah dekhakar man rize bina nahin rahata ki usamen ramakatha kii garima evam ramayana ke jivan-mulyon kaa lekhak ne samyak nirvaah kiya he
 Not surprisingly, young Narendra Kohli was blessed and praised by all the veteran writers of the time
 Moralist critic and litterateur Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Amritlal Nagar, Yashpal, Jainendrakumar, etc
 Almost all the top creators praised Narendra Kohli with open-hearted words
 Famous creators of the time like Jainendra also read the young Kohli and the words in which he expressed his response made it clear to announce the arrival of a special talent in Hindi literature
 main nahin jaanata ki upanyaas se kya apeksha hoti he or uskaa shilp kya hota he
 It seems that your creation rises higher from the religion of the novel to some class of scripture
 main iske liye aapkaa kritagya hota hoon or aapako hardik badhai detaa hoon
 -jainendra kumaar i have seen in you the talent that brings you among the leading writers of Hindi

 He has novelty, the story has a grip
 bhagwaticharan verma, You have tried to give as much realistic rational interpretation to the Ram Katha, which many historians believe to be merely mythological fiction or myth
 ahalya kii myth ko bhi kalpana se yatharth kaa abhas dene kaa acha prayaas
 yashpal You have seen Ram Katha with a completely new vision
 'avasar' main ram ke charitra ko aapane nayi maanviya drushti se chitrit kiya he
 The character of Sita you portrayed in this is very attractive
 sita ko kabhi aise tejodrupt rup main chitrit nahin kiya gaya tha
 Also, you have portrayed the character of Sumitra as a very stunning woman
 mujhe is baat kii prasannataa he ki yatha-sambhav ramayana katha kii mul ghatnaon ko parivartit kiye bina aapane uski ek manograhi vyakhya kii he
 


 the book reveals your study, contemplation and contemplation

 amritlal nagar Some first-class novelists now have a name and a name - firmly i want to convey my opinion to you
 


 All the characters related to Ramakatha have come out in new forms, their public-oriented role will sprout in each reader-reader, this is my future statement
 -kavi baba nagarjun Never before had i read such an elaborate interpretation of Ramakatha
 isse ram ko maanviya dharaatal par samajhane kii badi swasth drushti milti he or kori bhavukta ke sthaan par sangharsh kii yatharthata ubhar kar saamne aati he
 

 there is great freshness in your interpretation
 taareef to yah he ki aapane ramakatha kii parmparik garima ko kahin vikrut nahin hone diya he
 


 i would like you to inaugurate the Ramayana and other mythological episodes and characters of the Mahabharata
 If you are attuned to the work of risk, then you will be the pioneer of the new genre in Hindi fiction
 "-shivamangal Singh 'suman' da narendra kohli kaa hindi sahitya main apana vishisht sthaan he
 What he has written in the last thirty-thirty years is like being new as well as breaking a new ground in mythical terms
 


kohli ne vyang, naatak, samiksha or kahani ke kshetra main bhi apni moulik pratibha kaa parichay diya he
 a connoisseur of human compassion, Narendra Kohli is a talented senior litterateur of the present era
 " da vijayendra snaatak', In fact, Narendra Kohli has neither seen his Ramkatha from communal point of view nor from revivalist point of view
 This vision opposing the autocracy of humanist, expansionist monarchy is supportive of progressive humanism
 maanavtaa kii raksha tathaa nyaaypurna samtadhrut shoshanrahit samaaj kii sthapana kaa swapn na to kisi drushti se sampradayik he na hi punarutthanavaadee
 - dow kavita surabhi The contribution of Narendra Kohli is also high enough in quantum magnitude
 unniis upanyaason ko samete unki mahakavyatmak upanyaas shrinkhlaayein 'mahasamar', 'todo, kaara todo', 'abhyuday' hi gunvattta evam maatra donon kii drushti se apane purvavartiyon se kahin adhik hai
 His other novels can also be counted among the masterpieces in various categories
 saamaajik upanyaason main 'saath saha gaya dukh', 'kshamaa karnaa jiji', 'priti-katha'; aitihaasik upanyaason main rajyavardhan evam harshavardhan ke jivan par aadhaarit 'aatmadaan'; darshanik upanyaason main krishna-sudama ke jivan par aadhaarit 'abhigyaan'; puranic-aadhuniktaavaadi upanyaason main 'vasudev' unhen hindi ke samast purvavarti evam samakaleen sahityakaron se ucchtar pad par sthapit kar dete hai
 Apart from this, along with extensive satirical literature, drama and stories, Narendra Kohli has written serious and excellent essays, travel details and poignant criticisms
 sankshep main kaha jaay to unka avdaan gadhy kii har vidha main dekha ja saktaa he, evam vah praayah sabhi anya sahityakaron se unki vishisht vidha main bhi shreshth hai
 Even half of his work is enough to declare any other litterateur as an era-originating litterateur
 narendra kohli ne to un kathaon ko apana madhyam banaaya he jo apane vistaar evam vaividhya ke liye vishwa-vikhyath hai : ramakatha evam mahabharat katha
 While referring to 'yannabharathe - Tannabharathe', the number and variety of characters, events, sentiments etc
 mentioned in his mega ceremony 'mahasamar' will be sufficient
 See the description art, characterization, description of the personage, etc
 Kohli not only surpasses Premchand, but also has more sensitivity and depth
 narendra kohli kii vah visheshta jo unhen in donon purvavartiyon se vishisht banaati he vah he ek ke pashchaat ek pantis varshon tak nirantar unniis kaaljayi kritiyon kaa pranayan sarvshereshth he
 Apart from this, there are also large satirical literature, social novels, historical novels, psychological novels; Successful plays are such a treasure of conceptual essays, critical essays, critical and analytical arrangements, address, articles, memoirs, sketches
 

 gadhy kii prayek vidha main unhone hindi sahitya ko itnaa diya he ki unke samakaksh sabhi avdaan fike jaan padate hai
 Narendra Kohli has shown his ingenuity in all major and secondary genres of prose such as novel, story, satire, drama, essay, criticism, memoir etc
 upanyaas vidha par adbhut pakad hone ke kaa kaaran he narendra kohli kii kai vishyon main vyapak siddhahastata maanav manovigyaan ko vah gaharaai se samajhate hai evam vibhinn charitron ke mul tatv ko pakad kar bhinn-bhinn paristhitiyon main unki sahaj pratikraya ko ve prabhaavshaalee evam vishwasaneey dhang se prastut kar sakate hai
 Average and extraordinary, they not only capture all types of characters with their innate senses and penetrating analytical power, but also identify with them
 rajnatik samikarnon, ghaat-pratighaat, shakti-santulan ityadi kaa vyapak chithran unki rachanaaon main miltaa he
 On the level of language, style, craft and plot, Narendra Kohli has done many new and successful experiments
 upanyaason ko pracheen mahakavyon ke str tak uthaa kar unhone mahakavyatmak upanyaason kii nai vidha kaa avishkaar kiya he
 The best example of Narendra Kohli's perfection is the very brief frontend from the wide spread of his grandeur 'mahasamar' to 'suffered with grief'
 Enriched by hundreds of characters and thousands of events, there is no scattering anywhere in the four-thousand-page spread of the eight volumes of 'mahasamar', neither the discrepancies of the character, nor the difference of vision and philosophy
 How clear is the author's analytical vision in this epic novel written over a period of fifteen years, it can be understood by looking at his book "jahan hai dharma, wahi hai jai" which is based on the Mahabharata's semantics
 is granth main unhone 'mahasamar' main varnit paatro evam ghatnaon par vichaar kiya he, samasyaon ko saamne rakhaa he evam unka nidaan dhundne kaa prayaas kiya he
 This venture of this great philosopher, who tries to understand the Mahabharata, is made in view, in which a complete book is prepared in the graphs of his thought process
 sahitya ke vidhyaarthiyon or aalochakon ke liye narendra kohli kii sahitya-srijan-prakriya ko samajhane main yah granth na sirf mahatvapurn he varan param aavashyak he
 In this book, Narendra Kohli has given new and clear installations about various characters
 unki jan-maanas main ankit chhavi se prabhavit or aatankit hue bagaiyr ghatnaon ke taarkik vishleshan se kohliji ne krishna, yudhisthir, kunti, draupadi, bhishma, dron ityadi ke mul charitra kaa rudhigat chhaviyon se paryaapt bhinn vishleshan kiya he
 His second novel on the second pole is "saath Sahay Grief" which is woven with just two characters
 unke dwaara likhaa gaya praarambhik upanyaas hone ke baavjood yah hindi sahitya kii ek atyant shashakt evam praudh kriti he
 'saath saath grief' reveals Narendra Kohli's literary power
 'sidhi baat' ko sidhe-sidhe spasht rup se aise kah dena ki vah pathak ke man main utar jaae, use hansaa bhi de or rulaa bhi
 is kala main narendra kohli adwitiya hai
 'suffered with grief' reveals the sensitive side of Narendra Kohli
 mahadevi dwaara 'prasad' ke liye kahi gayi ukti unpar bilkul sateek baithti he: "


 se pramanit hota he ki unki jivan-veena ke taar itane sadhe hue the ki halki se halki jhankaar bhi usamen pratidhwani paa leti thi
 " "yah dekh kar mujhe aashcharya hota tha ki maatr dhai paatro kaa sada sapaat gharelu yaa paariwarik upanyaas itnaa gatiman evam aakarshak kaise ban gaya he
 By mixing the beauty of simplicity in the ornate life-language, which art has made it so full of condescending sensibilities
 " Kohli's first novel was 'resurrection'
 In this subjective-social novel, the novelist, with the goal of describing three generations, had tried to portray the mentality of people of different sections of the transitional society of independence and their circumstances of life-struggle through them
 iske pashchaat aayaa 'aatank'
 sad chuke vartmaan samaaj kii niraashajanak sthiti, atyaachaar se ladane kii uski asamarthta, buddhijiviyon kii vichaardhaara kii napunsakata evam ucch vichaardhaara kii karm main parinti kii asafalataa kaa isamen aisa chithran he jo man ko avsaad se bhar detaa he
 One of the great achievements of Narendra Kohli is "meaningful thinking on the current problems by removing them from the lapse of time and flow as the eternal problems of human society"
 The readable and engaging inclusion of philosophy, spirituality and policy in the novel makes him stand on a higher level than all the contemporary and earlier writers
 yon to chah varsh kii aayu se hi unhone likhnaa prarambh kar diya tha lekin 1960 ke baad se unki rachanaayen prakashit hone lageen
 They are different from contemporary writers in that they wrote known stories in a very original way
 aitihaasik kathaon par aadhaarit unke pramukh vrihadaakaar upanyaason kii suchi neeche di gayi he
 His compositions have been translated into various Indian languages
 ‘diksha’, ‘avasar’, ‘sangharsh kii ore’ or ‘yuddh’ naamak ramakatha shrinkhalaa kii kritiyon main kathakaar dwaara sahasrabdiyon kii parampara se janamanas main jame ishwaravatr bhav or bhakthibhaav kii jameen ko, usase judi dharm or ishwarvachi saanskrithik jameen ko todaa gaya he
 The new land of Ramkatha is presented in a new human, credible, physical, social, political and modern form

 Jean Cousin of Dieppe probably first used this interpolation in 1570 to display a map of the world
 yah prakshep nimnavat paribhaashit hota he: Where φ is latitude, λ is longitude, and λ0 is the central meridian
 maapni hameshaa kendriya madhyahn rekha ke sahare shuddh hoti he or purab se pashchim kii ore yah sarvatra sahi hoti he
 This is why the length of each parallel line on the map is proportional to the radius of its latitude on the globe
 iske kaaran maanchitr ke daahine or baayen parshv ek duusare ke pratibimbavat jyavakron ke ardhakon kii akruti vaale hote hai
 Apart from the prime meridian - which is a straight line - each meridian is also the half of the global wave but all have different amplitudes according to the value of their longitude, from which the trajectory is named sinusoidal or cycloidal
 sabhi madhyahn rekhaon kii lambaai pradhan madhyahn rekha se adhik pradarshit kii jaati he jabaki globe par ve sabhi samaan lambaai kii hoti hai
 This pattern becomes more dominant towards the edges of the map, and causes distortion
 do binduon ke madhya shuddh dooriyaan kendriya madhyahn rekha ke sahare or vishuvat rekha ke sahare naapi ja sakati hai
 Pure distances can be obtained by using another meridian, namely the vertical distance between parallel lines passing through those places
 maanchitr par kendriya madhyahn rekha or vishuvat rekha ke aasapaas ke kshetron main virupan sabase kam hota he or inase dur hone par badhata jaataa he
 Like the interpolation, Warner interpolation, intermediate bone interpolation, and bottom projection are some of the other interpolations on which these regions appear to have shrunk due to the distortion of the poles in the constructed maps

 Only one book was published in his life - Tractatus logico-philosophicus
 baad kii prakashit pustakon main Philosophical Investigations kaaphi charchit rahi
 Wittgenstein has been a professor at the University of Cambridge
 vitgenshtin ke pita karl ek yahudee the jinhone baad main protestant dharm apana liya tha
 Wittgenstein's greatest contribution is to put language in a philosophical perspective
 aaj koi bhi bhashaa vigyaan main jab darshan kaa ullekh karata he to vitganstin kaa naam swatah samaran hota he
 Wittgenstein's writings have resulted in considerable argumentation, even many times Wittgenstein's work has been called a paradox, but it would be wrong to say that logicians had emphasized logical analysis of language even before Wittgenstein
 vitganstin ke guru bartrand rasal rahe hai kaa tarkshastra ko darshan main uchit sthaan dilaane main baari yogadan he
 Wittgenstein's philosophical life is quite interesting because he has refuted his earlier works in his later works
 apni pehle kii pustakon main vitganstin satya ke liye bhashaa kaa mahatv bataate najar aate hai kintu apni antim pustak "philosophical investigations" main vitganstin ne bhashaa main vyaapt bis kaa vivaran kiya he
 Wittgenstein's conclusion proved to be new and important to the philosophical world
 vitgenstin ne ek prakaar se is vichaar kaa pratipaadan kiya ki bhashaa se satya kaa vivaran nahin balki satya kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 All western philosophy is rooted in language, but language shows us only one form of truth, the truth which we create by our belief or experience
 vitgenstin baar baar ek bhashakreedaa kaa ullekh karte hai, jisamen bhaag lene vaale kisi satya kii abhivyakti ke liye bhashaa kaa nirmaan va upyog karte hai
 Through this play, we tell the difference in the facts and truths related to the Wittgenstein language
 apni nirnaatmak pustak "philosophical investigations" main wo kehete hai ki " adhiktar baar jab ham shabd ke "arth" kii baat karte hai, tab ham keval ek bhashaa main us shabd ke yojan kii baat karte hai "

 motargadi chaalan se taatpary jameen par chalane vaali kisi gaadi ko niyantrit dhang se chalaanaa
 When a person starts buying a new car, then he has the desire to see how much speed the car catches
 lekin aisa karnaa khatre se khaali nahin hota
 He should not run more than 30 km per hour in the initial first 1000 km journey
 vaise to kaarkaanon main nirmaan ke baad prayek motor gaadi ke ingine ko thiye par baitha kar or chalaakar bhalee bhanti jaanch liya jaataa hai, lekin yah alpakaalik hi hota he
 Therefore, even after putting it in the car, all its bearings and parts are ruined by running it slowly for some time in the beginning
 aisa na karne se kai baar, ingine ke silinder, bering or shakti preshan yantra bahut garam hone se jal or anth kar itane kharaab ho sakate hai ki uni marammat karnaa asambhav ho jaay
 At this time they should also be given plenty of oil
 silinderon main bahut adhik tel dene se yahi haani hoti he ki vah phaltu tel jalakar, silinderon main carbon ke rup main jam jaataa he, jise pratham 1,000 kimi kii yatra ke baad hi saaf karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Then later it becomes necessary to clean up after a journey of 4,000 km
 gaadi kii suraksha ke liye uparyukt saavdhaanee baratani hi chahie
 To become a successful motorist, it is not enough to drive the vehicle without crashing, using its control equipment and the market congestion
 pratham yogyata to ek aadh ghante main hi praapt kii ja sakati he
 The hallmark of a skilled driver is that at all times, on average, at the highest speed, taking full care of himself and the public's safety, he should handle the vehicle in such a way that the cost of wear, wear and tear of petrol etc
 is minimum Ho
 yah gun nirantar abhyaas se hi praapt hota he
 The driver must have a good knowledge of the width of his car so that he can get the vehicle out of the minimum space without hitting anything
 use apni gaadi or duusare vaahanon kii raftaar kii sahi atkal lagane kii yogyata honi chaahe
 While operating the vehicle, the control devices should be operated in such a way that their action is perfectly organized
 driver kii nigahen aage ke raste par lagbhag 100 me kii duuri tak faili rahani chahie or aavashyaktaa padane par uskaa haath, bina maarg se drushti hataae, sahi niyantrak upkaran par padana chahie
 The eye of the new driver should extend approximately 100 m on the road ahead and his hand, if necessary, must fall to the correct controller device, without diverting sight
 nae driveron ke saath durghatnaayen praaia: isaliye hoti he ki ve upkarnon ko dekhakar pakadaney ke liye apni drushti maarg se hataa lete hai
 This qualification is obtained only after traveling several hundred km
 driveron ko pair se chalaae janevaale upkarnon kii sthiti kaa bhi sahi gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Often the novice accidentally slips the foot on the accelerator pane in an attempt to press the maneuvered brake with the desire to stop the car at once, causing a massive crash
 kai driver bheed bhaad kii jagah par perechlit brake kaa hi adhik upyog kiya karte hai, lekin unhen bagali main lage haath brake kaa bhi upyog karnaa chahie
 Many times a car has to be stopped within a distance of eight to ten feet
 aisi sthiti main andaja na rahane par yadi driver haath brake ko tatolta hi rah jaae to durghatana hona nishchit he
 It is also necessary for the driver to know the highway rules
 yaad rakhana chahie ki sadak kii bai taraf kaa bhaag apni gaadi or dahni taraf kaa bhaag saamne se aaneko vaahanon main liye nishchit he
 In order to violate the vehicles moving in their own direction, they should leave their left side and leave their right side
 kisi ghoda, yaa baiylgaadee ke chaalak, athwa police ke sipaahi ke kehane par driver ko motor ekadam rokani chahie, sambhav he ki ghoda, yaa bail chaalak ke vash main na ho; yaa chalane main asamarth ho
 Signs of soldiers standing at crossroads should be followed immediately
 saath hi driveron ko chahie ki ve swayan kidar ko janaa chaahate hai, yah baat ishaare se pulisavaalon ko bhi bataa den
 Also tell the other drivers walking near you that they want to stop or turn to where
 aadhunik rajmargo ke chauraahon aadi par yatayaat ke niyantran ke liye sipaahi tainaat na kar bijli ke swachaalit sanket bhi laga die jate hai, at: unhen bhi samajhakar tanudasar kaary karnaa chahie
 Due to differences in the composition of trains made from different factories, there is also some variation in the method of commissioning them
 vishesh kar sharad ritu main kai gaadiyaan chaalu hote samay kathinaayee utpann kar detii hai, at: pehle se hi unke niyantrak upkarnon kaa samanjan uchit prakaar se kar lenaa chahie
 For example, the self-propelling device may or may not have been installed in the vehicle, the antagonist and flame lever of each vehicle should be properly adjusted beforehand
 yadi gaadi main parivartansheel jwalak yukti lagi ho, jisase bijli kii chinagaari pehle se athwa vilambit kar chodi ja sakati ho, to gaadi ko chaalu karte samay use kuch lambit kar dena chahie
 If the spark will be released before then, the compressed gas will burn before time, which will put a lot of emphasis on the engine's gazen-pin etc
 chaalu karte hi gear box ke liver ko tatasth sthiti main rakhana chahie or bagali ke haath brake ko bandhaa hua
 Then, open the petrol and install a flame switch, so that the circuit is also completed
 yadi aavashyak ho to corburator ko halake se thakathaka dena chahie, jisase uske prakoshth main petrol bhar jaae
 Now, if the self-propelled device is installed, then it should be turned on, otherwise it is only possible to rotate by hand, then first its hand should be rotated for two whole times, so that in one cylinder the gas of petrol is compressed and filled, which ignites There will be preparation for the second cylinder and there will be suction action in the second cylinder
 phir jab handls neeche kii taraf ho, tab use ekadam jatke ke saath upar kii taraf ghumana chahie, is prakar jwalan hokar ingine chal padegaa
 Instead of the empty engine running for a few minutes, when the heat reaches each part, the burden of the dispatch machine of the vehicle should be put on it
 yadi radiator ke saath jal parivahak shater bhi laga ho, to sardiyon main use bhi ek do minute tak band rakhana chahie, jisase jacket ke pani main halaki si ushnata aa jaae
 When the engine starts running properly by the above mentioned actions, pressing the clutch panel for two to four seconds should put the transmitting device of the car in the following gear
 is samay bagali kaa brake laga rahanaa chahie or ek pair ko twaritra falak par rakhkar klach ko dhire se laga dena chahie
 Then the brake should be released as soon as the engine accelerates
 is prakaar gaadi dhimi raftaar se aage badhane lagegi
 In many modern trains, a second gear is added immediately after it is commissioned
 nimna gear se duusare gear par badali karne ke liye klach falak ko thodaa hi dabaanaa chahie, puraa nahin
 At this time, the accelerator panel should be left free, keeping the gear lever in neutral position for a moment and giving it the government in high position
 iske baad klach ko dhire se laga dena chahie
 Then the accelerator panel should be suppressed, causing the engine to rotate as many times as before
 gaadi ko or adhik unche gear par lagane ke liye use uchit raftaar par chalane dete hue uparyukt sabhi prakriyaayein doharaani chahie
 The only difference would be that the gear lever has to stay in neutral position for a few more moments
 gear ko unchi athwa nichi sthiti main badalte samay ukt tatasthta kii avadhi prayek gaadi ke liye bhinn hua karti he
 Once the car is mounted on a high gear, its speed is made by an inertial resistor
 gaadi ke gear ko hameshaa puraa klach dabaakar hi badalanaa chahie| agar puraa klach bina dabaaye aap gear badalte hai to gear box jaldi karaab hone kii ashanka bani rahati he| As previously stated, if the driver keeps his gaze extended about 100 meters ahead of the car on the road, then to change the gear or slow the speed to avoid coming from the front, playing bhup, turning, or climbing
 Adi gets a lot of time and there is no need to stop the car from jerking by applying both brakes
 yadi gaadi ko kahin tehraana abhisht ho, to pehle uparodhi ko band kar dena or twaritra falak se pair hataa lenaa chahie, lekin klach ko lage rahane dena chahie
 In this way, when the engine is running powerless and empty due to the smooth speed of the car, it will work as a type of brake, which will automatically slow down the car
 phir ant main klach ko bhi chhudaakar haath athwa pair kaa brake yatha avasar laga dena chahie
 The gear lever should be neutralized and the hand brake tied as soon as the vehicle stops
 yadi gaadi ko kisi dhaal par khadaa karnaa pade, to bai taraf ke agle yaa pichley pahie ko karb pathar se atka dena chahie, is prakaar gaadi ludhakegi bhi nahin or brake par bhi adhik jor nahin dena hoga
 There are two things to be remembered in relation to stopping the car: driver log praaia: yah galati kiya karte hai ki chadhaai par chadhate samay jab gaadi mand padane lagati he, tab bahut der baad gear badalane kaa praytn karte hai
 Although modern vehicles have a lot of flexibility in function and they can cross spontaneously at higher gears when shorter and lighter plies, but climbing higher at higher gears puts undue emphasis on engines and power transmission devices
 yahi tarika to he ki jyon hi chadhaai aarambh honevaali ho, aavashyak nimna gear par preshan yantra ko daal diya jaae, jisase gaadi apane main kuch adhik shakti sanchit kar le or yah chadhaai par kaam aae
 There is a possibility of danger due to the lack of road ahead on the turns of the road
 at: acha tarika yahi he ki kisi bhi tej mode athwa saadhaaran ghumaav ke aane ke 100 yaa 150 me pehle se hi gaadi kii raftaar kramash: kuch mand kar di jaani chahie, jisase aavashyaktaa padane par gaadi ko saralata se jaldi hi roka ja sake or ghumaate samay stearing par adhik jor na pade
 Here the car should be moved slightly left from the middle of the road, because from the center, the front part can be seen from a distance of the road
 is prakaar stearing chakra dhire dhire ghumaane se mode aane par swat: hi gaadi bain taraf sahi chali jaati he
 Extreme caution is required when driving in crowds
 hamaare aasapaas chalanevaale vyakti kya karnaa chaahate hai, is baat kaa sahi andaja lagaana sadaiv sambhav nahin hota
 Therefore, walking slowly in such places and always be alert and horny etc
 should be played clearly
 aage chalate hue do vaahanon ke bich main se haakar aage nikalne k koshish nahin kerani chahie
 Slow moving vehicles should be violated only when no other vehicle is coming from the front
 kisi mode par ghoomte samay to aisa kabhi bhi nahin karnaa chahie
 a horn should always be played before skipping a standing vehicle
 prayek motor driver ko rajpath par gaadi chalaate samay, yadi vah apni kushal chahta he to, janhit ko drushti main rakhte hue kuch niyamon kaa paalan karnaa atyaavashyak he, jinka yahan sanket maatr kiya jaataa he: The license is given at a yearly or quarterly fee according to the horsepower of the motor vehicle, which the motorist should always keep with him while driving and show it to the policemen on demand
 prayek gaadi ke aage or peeche, ytaakar akruti kaa number plate laga rahanaa chahie, jisaki jameen kaali yaa safed or akshar nirdhaarit naap ke tathaa safed yaa kaale rang main likhe hone chahie
 Two white lamps should be placed on each train in such a way that the width of the incoming train should be estimated from a distance
 ek chota safed lamp peeche kii taraf number plate ko prakashit karte hue laga rahanaa chahie or saath hi ek laal batti bhi honi chahie
 The previous lamp must be lit half an hour after sunset and should keep burning till half an hour before sunrise
 aage ke agradip suryaast ke ek ghante baad jala dene chahie or suryoday ke ek ghante pehle buja dene chahie
 Speed restrictions - Motor vehicles should not run more than 30 km per hour on the adjacent roads of the population
 aabaadi ke kshatron main 15 kimi prati ghanta se tej na chalaane kaa praaia: niyam hota he
 These types of information are written on the information supporting the roads
 chaal niyantran or anya prakaar kii chetavaniyaan tathaa anya bhi kai prakaar kii suchnaayen praaia: yathasthaan lagaai jaati he, jinhen samajhakar gaadi ko sadaiv saavdhaneepurvak itani raftaar se chalaanaa chahie ki kisi prakaar kii durghatana na ho

 Hernia suture is the surgical procedure to correct the hernia
 hernia aantarik angon yaa utakon main aae ubhaar ko kaha jaataa he, jo mansapeshiy diwaar main ek asaamaanya chhidr ke madhyam se baahar kii ore niklaa hua hota he
 The hernia may arise at the abdomen, groin, and at the site of the previously performed surgery
 aisa oparation he, jisamen hernia thili ko vankshan nalika main bina koi sudhaar karke nikaala jaataa he, jise "herniotomi" ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 When herniotomy is combined with a reinforced correction of the wall of the posterior inguinal tube containing the autogenous self-producing or miscellaneous material, it is called hernioplasty as opposed to the hernia suture, in which a self-producing or miscellaneous material is used for reproduction
 Is not used
 america main hernia sivan yaa hernioplasty ko aksar chal, yaa "dainik shalya chikitsa" prakriya dwaara nishpadit kiya jaataa he
 However, in other countries it is normal for it to be admitted to the hospital for 2-3 days
 sanyukt rajya america main prati varsh lagbhag 700,000 logon kaa upachaar kiya jaataa he
 These techniques can be divided into four groups
 hernia ke sudhaar kii ek vyaavhaarik takanic sabase pehle 1880 main basini dwaara varnit kii gai thi; basini kii takanic "tanaav" sudhaar" thi, jisamen dosha ke kinaaron ko bina kisi prabalikaran yaa yaa sudrudheekaran ke waapas ek saath sila jaataa tha
 In the bassini technique, the joint muscle is inferred to be ligament inguinal or closed
 haalanki hernia kii ucch punrariti dar, rog nivritti kii l6bi avadhi or pasch-shalya dard ke kaaran tanaav sudhaaron ko ab dekhbhaal ke liye maanak nahin mana jaataa he, kuch hi tanaav sudhaaron kaa aa ja upyog kiya jaataa he; inamen sholdise or kupar ligament / macwe sudhaar shaamil hai
 The sholdice technique is a reconstruction of complex four layers; However, it has a relatively low recurrence rate
 aajkal kiye jane vaale lagbhag sabhi sudhaar "tanaav mukt" hote hai, jisamen vankshan kshetra ko majboot banane ke liye synthetic jhanjhari kaa sthaapan shaamil he; kuch lokapriy takneekon main lichensten sudhaar, plag or ptch or proline hernia pranali shaamil hai
 This surgery is called "hernioplasty"
 prayukt jhanjhari vishesh rup se polipropolin yaa poliester se bani hoti he, yadhyapi kuch companiyaan teflone jhanjhari yaa aanshik rup se avashoshya jhanjhari bazaar main utaari hai
 The operation is usually performed under local anesthesia and patients go home from the hospital within a month of surgery, often requiring no medication other than aspirin or acetaminophen
 shlya kriya ke turant baad rogiyon ko chalane or chaaron ore ghoomane ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he or or iske baad ve shalya kriya ke ek se do saptahon ke bheetar apni saamaanya gatividhiyaan punah shuru kar sakate hai
 Recurrence rates are very low - one percent or less, compared to more than 10% of stress improvement
 Rates of complications are generally low, but can be quite severe and include chronic pain, ischemic orchitis, and testicular weathering
 haal ke varshon main, shalya chikitsa ke anya kshetron main, vankshan hernia kii leproscopy sudhaar ek vikalp ke rup main ubhara he
 The "lap" corrections are also stress-free, although meshes are placed in the pre-peritoneal space in opposition to or behind the defect
 mukt paddati par god ke laabh main tej punrariti samay or pasch-shalya dard score shaamil he
 Like the free method, laparoscopic surgery may involve local or general anesthesia, depending on the size of the hernia and related factors
 god aamtaur par adhik mahangi he, kyonki ise mukt sudhaar ke bajaay shalya kaksh samay kii adhik aavashyaktaa hoti he, lekin aspataal main bhartee hone kii choti avadhi kii aavashyaktaa he
 There is certainly no consensus about the comparative risk of complications, or the comparative rate of recurrence compared to public stress-free reforms
 haalanki, zyaadaatar gaiyr aakasmik pet kii surgery ke tareeke leproscopy kii ore bad rahe hai, kyonki chote chiron se kam rakt bahaav, kam sankraman, tej rog nivritti hoti he, aspataal main bhartee hone ke samay main kami or dard main kami aati he
 a special method of laparoscopic correction is totley extraperitoneal
 tep sudhaar main kam jatiltaayen hai or isamen aavartak vankshan hernia ke liye linchinsten sudhaar kii tulana main pasch-shalya pidashoonyata main kam samay lagata he
 a government committee called NICE has reviewed data on laparoscopic and free correction
 He concludes that there is no difference in cost, as the increase in the cost of operation is offset by the decreasing disease recovery period
 unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki punrariti kii dar samaan hai, lekin nae adhyayanon ne is par sawaal uthaae hai
 They found that more rapid recovery resulted in laparoscopic correction and less pain in the first few days
 unhone paaya ki god sudhaar main shalya chikitsa ke baad ghaav se sankraman kaa jokhim kam, kam rakt bahaav or kam sujan hoti he
 They also have less chronic pain, which lasts for many years and only one in 30 patients can suffer from it severely
 haal hi main kii gai ek america adhyayan main paaya gaya he ki god sudhaar ke baad shalya chikitsa ke do varshon ke bheetar kii punrariti 10 % he, jabaki mukt shalya chikitsa main yah 4 % hi he
 However, both of these results have been underestimated by international standards and suggested that the surgeons were inexperienced, particularly in relation to lap correction
 jhanjhari sudhaar main tanaav sudhaaron kii tulana main punrariti yaa aarambhik rog nivritti bahut kam hoti he
 Grating correction complications include infection, grating migration, adhesion formation, erosion of the intra-abdominal organs and chronic pain - most likely due to forgery of nerves, nerves, or sperms
 is prakaar kii jatiltaayen, aamtaur par phoda, nalwran yaa chote antra avrodh ke rup main prastut hone ke baad, praarambhik sudhaar karne se varshon se saptahon main thik ho jaati he
 Recently, the possibility of blockage of the fistula as a result of the fibroblast response to the grating has been reported as a cause for concern

 bhartiya darshan ke chah prakaaron main se sankhya bhi ek he jo prachinkaal main atyant lokapriy tathaa prathit hua tha
 It is a philosophy with absolutely opposite beliefs from Advaita Vedanta
 isaki sthapana karne vaale mul vyakti kapil kahe jate hai
 The literal meaning of 'sankhya' is 'numerical' or analysis
 isaki sabase pramukh dharna sristi ke prakruti-purush se bani hone kii he, yahan prakruti jad he or purush chetan
 The principles of shiva-shakti of the Shaktas, the energy sources of the Yoga scriptures, are seen in parallel
 bhartiya samskruti main kisi samay sankhya darshan kaa atyant unchaa sthaan tha
 The lofty minds of the country used to think through the method of Samkhya
 mahabharatakaar ne yahan tak kaha he ki gyaanan c loke yadihasti kinchit sankhyagatan tachch mahanmahatman 
 In fact, in the Mahabharata, the background of philosophical thought has an important place in numerology
 shaanti parv ke kai sthalon par sankhya darshan ke vichaaron kaa bade kavyamay or rochak dhang se ullekh kiya gaya he
 The influence of Sankhya philosophy is sufficiently existing on the philosophical background propounded in the Gita
 isaki lokapriyata kaa kaaran ek yah avashya rahaa he ki is darshan ne jivan main dikhaai padane vaale vaishamy kaa samaadhaan trigunatmak prakruti kii sarvakaaran rup main pratishtha karke bade sundar dhang se kiya
 The great quality of this nature-cause-debate of Sankhyacharyas is that the solution of the asymmetry of the world on the basis of the satta, rajas and tamas elements of different religions seems very wise
 kisi loukik samasya ko ishwar kaa niyam na maanakar in prakrutiyon ke talmail bigadane or jeevon ke purusharth na karne ko kaaran bataaya gaya he
 That is, the greatest greatness of Sankhya philosophy is that the origin of creation in it is not considered by God but it has been understood as a developmental process and it is believed that the creation after passing through many stages, in its present form Has been received
 kapilacharya ko kai anishvaravaadi maanate hai par bhagavadagita or satyarthprakash jaise granthon main is dharna kaa nishedh kiya gaya he
 The mainstay of Sankhya philosophy is hospitality
 is siddhanth ke anusaar, bina kaaran ke kaary kii utpatti nahin ho sakati
 As a result, this world has its origin from zero, not from any fundamental entity
 yah siddhanth baudhon ke shoonyavad ke vipareet he
 Work remains in the full cause of its origin
 kaary apane kaaran kaa saar he
 Work and reason are express and latent forms of virtually the same process
 satkaryawad ke do bhed hai- parinamwad tathaa vivartvaad
 Consequentialism implies that reason is transformed into action in real form
 jaise til tel main, doodh dahi main roopantarit hota he
 According to discourse, change is real rather than real
 jaise-rassi main sarp kaa abhas hona
 Sankhya philosophy was very popular and famous in ancient times
 bhartiya samskruti main kisi samay sankhya darshan kaa atyant unchaa sthaan tha
 The lofty minds of the country used to think through the method of Samkhya
 mahabharatakaar ne yahan tak kaha he ki gyaanan c loke yadihasti kinchit sankhyagatan tachch mahanmahatman 
 In fact, in the Mahabharata, the background of philosophical thought has an important place in numerology
 shanti parv ke kai sthalon par sankhya darshan ke vichaaron kaa bade kavyamay or rochak dhang se ullekh kiya gaya he
 The influence of Sankhya philosophy is sufficiently existing on the philosophical background propounded in the Gita
 vastut: sankhya darshan kisi samay atyant lokapriy ho gaya tha
 Whatever may be the reasons for its popularity, but one must have seemed that this philosophy has resolved the contrast seen in life in a beautiful manner by reposing the trinitarian nature as omnipresent
 sankhyacharyon ke is prakruti-kaaran-vaad kaa mahaan gun yah he ki pruthak-pruthak dharm vaale satvon, rajas tathaa tamas tatwon ke aadhaar par jagat ke vaishamy kaa kiya gaya samaadhaan bada nyaayayukt tathaa buddhigamya prathit hota he
 The word "samkhya" is derived by adding the atomic suffix to the word "number" and the etymology of the word number is samachaksham dhatiya khyan darshanya suffix top, according to which it means Samyakti Khyati, Sadhu Darshan or True Knowledge
 sankhyacharyon kii yah samyak khyaati, unka yah satya gyaan vyaktavyakt rup dwividh achit tatv se purush rup chit tatv ko pruthak jaan lene main nihit he
 The man remains virtually untouched even if he appears to be stained in the prapancha from the top
 usamen aasakt yaa lipt dikhaai padane par bhi vastut: anasakt yaa nirlypt rahata he--sankhyacharyon kii yah sabase badi darshanik khoj unheen ke shabdon main satvapurushanyatakhyati, vivek khyaati, vyaktavyaktjvvigyaan, aadi naamon se vyavahrut hoti he
 With this wisdom, people believe in accomplishing the ultimate effort or goal of human life
 is prakaar "sankhya", shabd sankhyacharyon kii sabase badi darshanik khoj kaa vaastavik swaroop prakat karne vaala sankshipt naam he jiske sarvapratham vyaakhyaata hone ke kaaran unki vichaardhaara atyant pracheen kaal main "sankhya" naam se abhihit hui
 The term "samkhya" is also considered to be a fallacy from the word "number"
 mahabharat main sankhya ke vishay main aae hue ek shloke main ye donon hi prakaar ke bhav prakat kiye gaye hai
 It is as follows - Number Prakurvate Chave Prakriti Prakrakshate
 tattwani c chatuvinshad ten sankhya: prakirtita:
 The meaning of this is that the number which preaches the wisdom of nature and man, which imparts the effect of nature and the number which determines the number twenty-four of the elements, are called Sankhya
 kuch logon kii aisi dharna he ki gnanarthak "sankhya" shabd se kii jane vaali gaun sankhya main prakruti evam purush ke vivek gyaan se hi jivan ke param lakshya kaivalya yaa moksh kii siddhi maani gai he, at: us gyaan kii prapti hi mukhya he or is kaaran se usee par sankhya kaa sara bal he
 Sankhya assumes twenty-four elements, it is just a statement of a common fact, hence secondary
 udaiveer shastri ne apane "sankhya darshan kaa itihaas" naamak granth main sankhya shaastra ke kapil dwaara pranit hone main bhagwat 3-25-1 par shridhar swami kii vyakhya ko uddhrut karte hue is prakaar likhaa he- antim shloke kii vyakhya karte hue vyakhyaakaar ne spasht likhaa he- tatwanaa sankhyata ganak: sankhya-pravartak ityarth:
 This makes it certain that this Kapil is the innovator or prophet of Sankhya
 shridhar swami ke ganak: shabd par shastri ji ne neeche die gaye footnot main is prakaar likhaa he- madhya kaal ke kuch vyakhyakaaron ne "sankhya" pad main "sankhya" shabd ko gananaaparak samajhakar is prakaar ke vyaakhyaan kiye hai
 In fact, it means elemental knowledge
 parantu gaharaai se vichaar karne par yah baat utani saamaanya yaa gaun nahin he jitani apatat: prathit hoti he
 It seems that in very early times when the number of elements could not be fixed in the initial stage of philosophical development, then Sankhya first tried the subtle metaphysics of this visible physical world, which in turn resulted in the number of elements present in its origin
 : Was determined twenty four
 inamen bhi pratham tatv jise unhone "prakruti" yaa "pradhan" naam diya, shesh taees kaa mul siddh kiya gaya
 This same element "nature" was considered to be the result of the Chish Purush, resulting in twenty-three different elements respectively and generating the entire root world
 is prakaar tatv sankhya ke nirdhaaran ke peeche sankhyon kii bahut badi bauddhik sadhana chhipi hui prathit hoti he
 After all, how would it have been possible to determine the number of elements through micro-intelligence without thinking and analyzing for a long time? uparyukt vivechan se aisa nishchay hota he ki sankhya darshan kaa "sankhya" naam donon hi prakaaron se uske buddhivaadee tarkpradhan hone kaa suchak he
 Even considering the basic nature of the figures and the Chit Purush both of the basic elements as proven by the Agama or Shruti proof, it is also evident to prove it mainly on the basis of conjecture proof
 aaj kal uplabdh sankhya pravachan sutara evam sankhyakarik, in donon hi moulik sankhya granthon ko dekhne se spasht gyaat hota he ki inamen sankhya ke donon hi moulik tatwon- prakruti evam purush kii satta hetuon ke aadhaar par anumaan dwaara hi siddh kii gai he
 Tips are also given in the man's plurality
 satkaryawad kii sthapana bhi tarkon ke hi aadhaar par kii gai he
 
 is prakaar sankhya shaastra kaa shravan, jo vivek gyaan kaa muladhar he, tark pradhan he
 Contemplation is the contemplation of facts and principles scripted by long-term arguments
 is prakaar jis sankhya yaa vivek gyaan ke kaaran sankhya darshan kaa "sankhya" naam padaa, uskaa vishesh sambandh tark or buddhivaadita se he
 Due to this rationalism, some theories of Sankhya philosophy developed very independently from the Vedic sect in the later period, due to which the Acharyas like Badarayana Vyasa and Shankaracharya refuted it and even said it to the vedic sect
 yah sampradaay apane mul main to avaidic nahin prathit hota or apane parvarti rup main bhi sarvatha avaidic nahin he
 The famous commentator Vigyanbhukta has also considered Sankhya to be the contemplation of Agama or Shruti by the arguments of Satta
 unhone apane sankhya pravachan-sutara-bhashya kii avataranika main yahi baat is prakaar kahi he- jo "akodwitiya:" ityadi purush vishyak veda vachan jeev kaa sara abhiyaan dur karke use mukt karaane ke liye us purush ko sarv prakaar ke vaishamry- rupabhed se rahit bataate hai unheen veda vachanon ke arth ke manan ke liye apekshit sad yuktiyon kaa upadesh karne ke liye sankhyakarta narayanavatar bhagwaan kapil aavirbhoot hue the
 Science is clear from the monk's earlier discourses that he considers Sankhya Shastra as Vedanusari
 unka spasht mat he ki "akodwitiyah" ityadi veda vachanon ke arth kaa hi vah sad yuktiyon evam tarkon dwaara samarthan karata he, uskaa pratipaadan or vivechan karke use bodhgamy banaata he
 Vigyanbhuk has actually expressed his aforesaid opinion by following the earlier tradition prevalent in folk
 atyant pracheen kaal se hi mahabharat, gita, ramayana, smritiyon tathaa puraanon main sarvatra sankhya kaa na keval ucch gyaan ke rup main ullekh bhar hua he, apitu uske siddhanton kaa yatra-tatra vistrut vivaran bhi hua he
 In the Gita too, the trinitarian principle of Sankhya philosophy has been adopted very beautifully
 "trigunatmika prakruti nity parinamini he
 His three qualities always produce some or the other result, man is a non-believer "- this principle of Samkhya has become an essential part of Gita's Nishkam Karmayoga
 isi prakaar anyatra bhi sankhya darshan ke anek siddhant anya darshanon ke siddhanton ke poorak rup se pracheen sanskrit vadmay main drushtigochar hote hai
 From all these things, it seems that this philosophy has been Vedic in its origin, not impersonal, because if the truth were contrary to this, Vedaprana would not have given the above mentioned area for so much propagation of Samkhya in this country
 is anishvarwad, prakruti purush dwaitvaad, parinamwad aadi tathakthith veda viruddh siddhanton ke kaaran vedabaahya kahkar iskaa khandan karne vaale vedant bhashyakaar shankaracharya ko bhi brahmasutra 2
1
3 ke bhashya main likhnaa hi padaa ki "aadhyaatmavishyak anek smritiyon ke hone par bhi sankhya yoga smritiyon ke hi niraakaran main praytn kiya gaya
 Because both of them are famous as the means of ultimate effort in the world, are acclaimed by the saintly great men and consist of "linga", "tatkaranam Sankhya Yogabhishannam Gyatva Deva and Muchyatee Sarvapashai: Ya, etc
 " swayan bhashyakaar ke apane sakshya se bhi spasht he ki unke purvavarti sutarakaar ke samay main bhi anek shisht purush sankhya darshan ko vaidic darshan maanate the tathaa param purusharth kaa saadhan maanakar uskaa anusaran karte the
 Based on all these facts, it is expedient to consider Sankhya philosophy as Vedic
 haan, apane parvarti vikaas main yah avashya hi kuch moolbhoot siddhanton main veda viruddh ho gaya he jaise uttarvarti sankhya vaidic parampara ke viruddh nirishwar he, uski prakruti swatantra rup se swat: samast vishwa kii sristi karti he
 But the origin of this philosophy is found in the oldest Chandogya and Vrhadaranyaka Upanishads
 isi se isaki pracheenta suspasht he
 Only two fundamental texts of this philosophy are available today - the first "samkhya-discourse-sutra" with six chapters and the second "samkhikarika" with seventy kariks
 in do ke atirikt ek atyant laghukaay sutaragranth bhi he jo "tatv samaas" ke naam se prasiddh he
 The rest of the Samkhya Vadmaya is only the commentary and epitope of these three
 inamen sankhya sutron ke upadeshta parampara se kapil muni maane jate hai
 Scholars do not consider the Sankhya-discourse-sutras available for many reasons to be Kapilized
 itani baat avashya hi nishchit he ki in sutron ko kapilopdisht maanane par bhi iske anek sthalon ko swayan sutron ke hi ant:-sakshya ke bal par prakshipt maananaa padegaa
 The numerals are composed by Ishvakrishna, whose time is considered by the majority to be the middle of the third century AD
 vastut: inkaa samay isse paryaapt purv kaa prathit hota he
 There is no scripture of Kapuri's disciple, Asuri, but his famous disciple Acharya Panchshikh, in the form of many sutras quoted in ancient texts like Vyasarit Yogabhasya, etc
, it seems clear that any sutra script by him was famous in ancient times
 anek vidwaanon ke mat se yah prasiddh granth shashthitantr hi tha
 By the opinion of Udayveer Shastri, the conspiracy-related Sankhya-discourse-sutra available in the present times was also known as "shashtitantra" due to the representation of shasthi substances
 unke mat se sambhavat: kapil muni ke prashishy panchashikhacharya ne us par vyakhya likhi thi or vah bhi mulgranth ke hi naam par shashthitantr kahi jaati thi
 According to the opinion of some scholars, "shashthi Tantra" is written of the famous numerical annuity
 jaigishadhya, deval, asit ityadi anya anek pracheen sankhyacharyon ke vishay main aaj kuch vishesh gyaan nahin he
 During sexual union or sexual intercourse, when there is sexual stimulation in the penis of the male and the ejaculation comes out of the penis at the peak of sexual excitement, this is called ejaculation or ejaculation
 veerypat ke samay purush ko charmanand praapt hota he
 What is the age of starting an ejaculation? Normally, the child is masturbating for the first time at the age of 10 to 15 years
 skhalan main veery kii maatra 5ml se 20ml tak hoti he
 Ways to get rid of premature ejaculation matsay kaal yaa 'divoni kalp' bhuvaigyanik kaal he jo purajivi mahakalp ke silyuri yug ke ant se armbh hokar ) carboni kalp ke armbh tak failaa hua he
 This kalpa is named after the Devon region of England, where rocks of this period were first studied
 matsay varg kaa vikaas is yug main vishesh rup se hua or isi ke aadhaar par is yug ko 'matsay yug' bhi kehete hai
 Based on the fossils found in the Devon region of England, William Launerdale reported in 1837 that the deposits in which these fossils are found and which were previously thought to be under the Silurian era are somewhat newer than the deposits of the Silurian era
 isi aadhaar par 1840 i0 main marachiraan or sejavik ne divonipranali kaa namakaran kiya
 Gradually deposits of this system were also found in other places of the world, and now in the level-rock-structure of the world, the Divoni kalpa is placed above the Silurian and below the Carboniferous in the Paleozoic kalpa
 is pranali main do prakaar ke nikshep milte hai
 a marine deposit ranging from the regions of Cornwall and Devon in southern Western Ireland and England to Belgium, Central Germany, South Finland and Russia; The second continental deposits, which meet in the north in Ireland, Wales, Manmath, Scotland, Scadinavia, Spitsverg and northern Finland, are known as 'old Red Sandstones'
 uttari america main bhi is pranali ke antargat isi prakaar do nikshep uttar or dakshin main sthit hai
 The Australian continent has the Divoni Eon divided into three parts: the first part was the era of igneous eclipse, in which many igneous rocks were formed
 duusari avadhi main pravalyukt chuunaa pathar miltaa he, jo samudri nikshep he
 In the third period there were mixed deposits, including some igneous and some marine
 bharat main divoni kalp kaa pradurbhaav silyurian chuunaa pathar samooh ke pashchaat mana jaataa he
 Indian Divony covers 4,000 feet thick white quartzite located in the Spiti Valley, known as quartzite
 is shailasamooh kaa bhartiya str shailavigyaan main ek vishesh sthaan he
 The reason for this is that no fossils are found in them
 yah bahut mahatvapurn baat he ki us samay se bahut purv jeev vikaas purnataya sthapit ho chukaa tha, phir bhi is mote tah main koi jeevavshesh nahin he
 Due to the absence of fossils, these quartzites cannot be classified properly according to chronology
 parantu quartzite ke neeche ke shailasamoohon main paintamoras oblangus naam ke jeev ke hone se itnaa satya he ki ye shailaster silyurian yug ke baad ke hai
 Similarly, in the rocks found on these, organisms of Carboniferous era are found
 at: isse in quartziton kaa divoni hona pramanit hota he
 Apart from the Spiti Valley, deposits of Divoni Kalpa are also found in places like Kashmir, Kumaon, Chitral etc
 bharat main himalay pradesh ke atirikt anya kisi sthaan par is pranali ke nikshep nahin hai
 Divoni Kalpa is also called the 'era of building mountains', because at this time many mountains were built across the world
 inamen pashchimi europe main callidonian parvatamala or uttari america ke ekaidian parvat mukhya hai
 Mountains were formed as a result of the Caledonian movement in all places in Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium etc
 divoni kalp main samudr kaa vistaar madhya, uttari america, madhya atlentic, europe, himalay pradesh, dakshini china, japan, dakhini america ke uttar or dakshin main, australia ke uttar pashchim or dakshin purvi pradesh or dakshini sagar main tha
 The rest of the earth was dry
 divoni kalp jeevvikas ke liye atyant mahatvapurn hai
