 a heart transplant, or heart transplant, is a surgical response performed on a patient who is in late stage of heart failure, or who has severe coronary artery disease
 The most common way of doing this is to take a working heart out of the body of a dead person who wanted to donate his heart and put it in the body of the patient, in this process, the patient's heart is removed in the normal process or It is left to support the donor, this is what we call the heterotopic process, the most controversial solution to overcome this complex disease of human
 The survival period after the operation is now an average of 15 years

 Once the donor heart inspection is passed, the patient is taken to the operating room and is given anesthetic medication
 He is taken in an orthotopic or heterotopic procedure, depending on the condition of the donor and the patient

 jab nayaa dil chaalu hota he tab marij ko cardeopulmonary bypass se chhudaaya jaataa he or sine ko band kiya jaataa he
 In the heterotopic procedure, the patient's heart is not removed until the donor's heart is transplanted
 The position of the new heart is such that the blood vessels of the heart and the blood vessels of the two hearts can be connected so that an effective connected heart can be formed
 This procedure gives the patient's heart a chance to be cured and if the donor's heart fails due to rejection then it is removed
 Give the patient's heart a chance to work
 Heterotopic procedure is done only when The donor's heart is not so strong that he can work himself
 Once the patient is discharged from the hospital, then he has to come to the hospital again and again for regular treatment
 They may also require emotional support
 The number of visits to the hospital is reduced after the patient is rested with the transplant
 The patient has to remain in immunosuppressive medicine throughout the life so that his heart does not get rejected

 Parapsychology is a controversial method that attempts to test whether psychological abilities exist even after death, using scientific method
 paramanovigyaan kaa sambandh manushya kii un adhisaamaanya shaktiyon se he, jinaki vyakhya ab tak ke prachlit saamaanya manovaigyanik siddhanton se nahin ho paati
 The interpretation of these so-called natural and eccentric phenomena or processes does not help even with known physical suffixes
 parchittagyaan, vichaarsankraman, duranubhuti, purvambhas, atindriagyaan, manojanit gati yaa "psycocinosis" aadi kuch aisi prakriyaayein hai jo ek bhinn koti kii maanviya shakti tathaa anubhuti kii ore sanket karti hai
 These phenomena have been grossly neglected at the scientific level and have often been considered separate from science by associating them with sorcery and renaming the occultism
 kintu ye vilakshan prathit honevaali ghatnaayen ghatit hoti hai
 Scientists can ignore them, but cannot prevent events from happening

 The main problem is the attempt to tie them to the periphery of the experimental method

 Parapsychology is relatively limited - it is the experimental side of paramedical research - its scientific discipline is more rigorous

 Folklore, ancient literature, philosophy and scripture are replete with examples of transcendental events and amazing human powers

 Prof
 Rhine used "zener Cards" which contained a set of five cards

 The general probability statistic is used to derive the results according to which the probability of success of the estimates here is 1 / 5, ie five of the twenty five estimates

 While Morse was in Britain, the American and British people were engaged in the War of 1812 and the United States society was divided over loyalty
 america ke federal-virdohi tatva france ke saath ho gaye or british se ghrinaa karne lage or unka vishwaas tha ki ek prabal kendriya sarkaar loktantr ke liye khatara ban sakati he
 As the war progressed, his anti-federalist views began to appear in letters written to his parents

 Perhaps some people did not praise the internal functioning of the American government

 He wanted to make a grand portrait of a man who announced the establishment of a free and independent America

 1825 main, neuyork shahar ne washington main gilbert du motier, marquis de laughyete kaa chitra banane ke liye morse ko $1,000 die
 While making this painting, a horse riding messenger brought his father's letter, with only one line written, "your wife is dead"
 Morse immediately left Washington for his home in New Haven, leaving Lafayette's picture incomplete

 Council of India Act 1909 or marley-minto Reforms India Council Act 1909 is also known as marley-minto Reforms because at this time Marley was the Secretary of India and Lord Minto Viceroy
 inhen donon ke naam par ise marle-minto sudhaaron kii sangya di gayi
 There were two main events behind the government introducing these reforms
 oktober 1906 main aagaa khan ke netritv main ek muslim pratinidhimandal vysarai lard minto se mila or maang kii ki musalamaanon ke liye pruthak nirvachan pranali kii vyavastha kii jaae tathaa musalamaanon ko unki jansankhya ke anupaat main pratinidhitiv diya jaye
 The delegation argued that they should be given separate community representation to 'serve their empire'
 1906 main dhaka main nawab salimullah, nawab mohsin-ul-mulk or vakaar-ul-mulk dwaara muslim lig kii sthapana kii gayi thi
 This delegation from Lord Minto soon joined the Muslim League
 muslim lig ne musalamaanon ko samrajya ke prati nishtha prakat karne kii shiksha di tathaa muslim buddhijiviyon ko congress se pruthak rakhane kaa prayaas kiya
 In addition, reforms were also required by the Congress every year to demand reforms, to satisfy the soft party, to reduce the influence of extremists, and to prevent revolutionary nationalism
 mukhya sudhaar 1909 ke marle-minto sudhaaron kii mukhya dharayen is prakaar thim- According to this act, the number of elected members in the Central and Provincial Legislative Councils was increased
 prantiy vidhaan parishadon main gaiyr-sarkari bahumat sthapit kiya gaya
 But the number of nominated and un-elected members was higher among the non-government members, due to which their number still remained higher than the elected members
 sumit sarkaar ke anusaar, kendriya vyavasthapika sabha main 60 sadsy or 9 paden sadsy hote the
 Of these 69 members, 37 were government officials and 32 were non-government members
 32 gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon main se 5 namjad evam 27 chune huye sadsy the
 Of the 27 elected members, 8 seats were reserved for Muslims under separate constituencies, while 4 seats were reserved for British capitalists and 2 seats for landlords and 13 seats were under general election
 nirvaachit sadsy apratyaksh rup se chune jate the
 Electoral councils were formed from local bodies
 ye prantiy vidhaan parishadon ke sadasyon kaa nirvachan karti karte the
 Members of the Provincial Legislative Councils elected members of the Central Administrator
 is adhinium dwaara musalamaanon ke liye pruthak saamudayik pratinidhitiv pranali lagu kii gayi
 At the same time, special concession was given to Muslims in terms of representation
 unhen kendriya evam prantiy vidhaan parishad main jansankhya ke anupaat main adhik pratinidhi bhejne kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 The eligibility of income for Muslim voters was also reduced compared to Hindus
 vyavasthapika sabhaaon ke adhikaron main vruddhi kii gayi
 Members were empowered to debate economic proposals, to propose amendments to their subjects, to vote on certain subjects, to ask questions, to vote on general questions, to debate general questions and to submit public interest proposals
 vyavasthapikaon ko itane adhikaar dene ke pashchaat bhi governor general tathaa governron ko vyavasthapikaon main prastaavon ko thukaraane kaa adhikaar tha
 Arrangements were made to appoint an Indian member to the Executive of the Governor General

 Review revamp 1909 ke sudhaaron se bhartiya rajnatik prashn kaa na koi hal ho saktaa tha na hi isse vah niklaa
 Indirect elections, limited franchise and limited powers of the Legislative Council made the representative government a mix
 lard marle ne spasht taur par kaha ki bharat swashaasan ke yogya nahin he
 Even after Congress demanded self-government every year, Marley categorically turned it down
 usne bharat main sansadeey shashan vyavastha yaa uttaradaayi sarkaar kii sthapana kaa spasht virodh kiya
 He said "if it is said that this chapter of reforms will help in establishing or having a direct or inevitable parliamentary system in India, then i have nothing to do with it"
 vastav main 1909 ke sudhaaron kaa mukhya uddeshy udaarvaadiyon ko digbhramit kar rashtravaadi dal main foot daalana tathaa sampradayik nirvachan pranali ko apana kar rashtriya ekta ko vinasht karnaa tha
 The government wanted to curb the boom of nationalism by luring the moderates and Muslims through these reforms
 sarkaar evam muslim netaaon ne jab bhi dwipaksheeya vaarta kii, uskaa mukhya vishay pruthak nirvachan pranali hi rahaa kintu vastav main is vyavastha se musalamaanon kaa chota varg hi labhanvit ho sakaa
 The method adopted under this Act was so obscure that the system of public representation became a sort of filtering of many kinds of filters
 kuch log sthaneey nikaayon kaa chunaav karte the, ye sadsy chunaav mandalon kaa chunaav karte the or ye chunaav mandal prantiy parishadon ke sadasyon kaa chunaav karte the or yahi prantiy parishadon ke sadsy kendriya parishad ke sadasyon kaa chunaav karte the
 Implementing the reforms, a lot of problems occurred
 sansadeey pranali to de di gayi parantu uttardaayitv nahin diya gaya, jisase bhartiya netaaon ne vidhaan mandalon ko sarkaar kii katu aalochana karne kaa manch bana liya
 Only a few Indian leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale could make real use of this opportunity
 unhone sabhi ke liye praathmik shiksha, sarkaar kii damankaaree nitiyon kii aalochana tathaa dakshin africa main bhartiya mazdooron par ho rahe atyaachaar jaise muddon ko uthaakar is manch kaa sahi arthon main upyog kiya
 Although the principle of electoral system was recognized by this Act for the first time in India, for the first time Indians were represented in the Executive Council of the Governor General and the members of the Central and Provincial Legislative Councils were given some limited powers, but the average achievements of the Act were negligible
 She stayed
 1909 ke sudhaaron se janata ko keval ‘nammaatr’ sudhaar hi praapt huye, vaastavik rup se kuch nahin
 It got effect but no power
 shashan kaa uttardaayitv anya varg ko or shakti anya varg ko saunp di
 Such a situation arose that bitterness between the legislature and the executive increased and relations between Indians and the government became worse
 1909 ke sudhaaron se janata ne kuch or hi chaha tha unhen kuch or hi mila
 Indians demanded self-government and were handed over to 'benevolent autocracy'

 rajan Isa ibn Maryam or Jesus Christ, according to Islam, is one of the prophets sent by Allah to mankind, one of the major personalities of Christianity
 isa, islam ke un 25 pegambaron main se ek hai, jinka ullekh quran main kiya gaya he
 According to Islamic theology, Jesus is placed second most important after Muhammad
 bible main die gaye unki aatmakatha se jude lagbhag sari daivi ghatnaon ko islam main mana jaataa he, jisamen: kunvarigarbha se janm, unke chamatkaar, unke cross par chadhaay jane, mrityu or mritotthana shaamil hai
 However, according to some verses of the Quran, crucifixion, death and resurrection were not genuine incidents
 baharhaal, masihiyon ke viruddh muslmaan, isa ko ishvarputra yaa trimurtitv ko nahin maanate
 In Islam, Jesus is considered a venerable prophet who God sent to Israel to spread his message
 quran ke anusaar, allaah ne isa ko inzel namak pavitra kitaab kaa ilhaam diya tha, joki islamic manyata ke anusaar, allaah dwaara maanavtaa ko pradaan kiye gaye chaar pavitra kitabon main se ek he
 The name of Jesus in the Quran is more than that of Muhammad, and Mussulman is believed to have been born by the virgin mother of Jesus
 islam main isa messiah sabhi nabiyon kii tarah hi mahaz ek nashwar insaan mana jaataa he, or isai manyata kii tarah, ishwar-putr yaa trimurti kaa sadsy nahin mana jaataa he, or unki puja par manaahi he
 He got the ability to perform miracles from God and such powers were not present in Jesus himself
 yah bhi nahin mana jaataa he ki ve cross par latake
 According to Islamic tradition, he was raised directly to heaven by God, despite dying on the cross
 sab nabiyon kii tarah, isa messiah bhi quran main ek muslim kehalaae gaye hai
 According to the Quran, Jesus never considered himself a God-son and would deny this on the Day of Judgment
 musulmaanon kii manyata he ki qayamat ke din par, isa messiah prithvi par laut aaenge or nyaay qayaam karenga
 In the hadiths of Muhammad, "all prophets are brothers and Christ is my closest brother because no prophet has come between me and Jesus"
 quran main isa kaa naam 25 baar aayaa he
 There is a story of his birth in Surah Maryam and similarly in Surah Ali Imran
 quran main isa kaa zikr, mohammad se bhi adhik he
 The crucifixion, death and return of Jesus is very important in Islam
 Most Muslims do not accept his death and return
 musalamaanon kii badi sankhya kaa maananaa he ki quran kii in aayaton main, jinamein messiah kii mrityu kaa ullekh he, vah keval bamuhaavara he
 Adhinash Ulema states that Christ was not crucified, but was taken up in paradise
 jabaki kuch anya ulema kaa maananaa he ki unako mrityu ke baad, ishwar dwaara punah jivit kiya gaya or phir jananath le jaaya gaya
 But it is agreed upon by all Muslim ulema that Christ will come back to earth at the appointed time, and will implement Islam on earth according to God's will

 a tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a large low pressure center and heavy thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain
 ushnkaribandheey chakravaat kii utpatti tab hoti he jab nam hawa ke upar uthne se garmi paidaa hoti he, jiske falswaroop nam hawa main nihit jalawaashp kaa sanghanan hota he
 They are produced by different heating systems than other cyclone thunderstorms such as nor'easter, European thunderstorms and polar lows, leading to the classification of their "hot center" thunderstorm system
 Tropical cyclones begin in the calm tropics at a distance of 10 degrees from the equator
 "ushnkaribandheey" shabd in pranaaliyon ke bhugolic mul, jo lagbhag anany rup se duniya bhar main ushnkaribandheey kshetron main banati he or samudratati ushnkaribandheey air masses main unka nirmaan, donon kaa ullekh karti he
 "the term cyclone refers to the cyclonic nature of such thunderstorms, which rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and rotate counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere
 apane sthaan or tivrata ke aadhaar par, ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ko alag-alag naamon se janaa jaataa he jaise hurricane, typhone, tropical storm, cychlonic storm, tropical depressant, or keval cyclone 
 While tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rain, they produce waves of high waves and damaging thunderstorms as well as high amounts of storms
 ve garm pani kii badi raashiyon ko viksit karte hai or bhoomi par chalate hue apni takat kho dete hai
 This is why the coastal region may suffer severe damage from a tropical cyclone, while the interior areas are relatively safe from receiving strong winds

 Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditions
 They also carry heat and energy from the tropics and transport them to temperate latitudes, making them an important part of the world's atmospheric circulation system

 Many tropical cyclones develop when conditions in the atmosphere around a weak disturbance are favorable
 prishthbhumi vaataavaran jalwaayu chakra or udaahranon jaise madan-julian dolan, al nino-dakshini dolan or atlantic multidacodel dolan ke kaaran ghatata badhata he

 At the other end of the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or a tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually disappears

 This heat is distributed vertically around the center of the storm

 The eyewall is a circle of strong thunderstorms around the eye; This is the place where the strongest winds are found, where the clouds reach the highest and the intensity is heaviest
 hawa se sabase baari kshati vahaan hoti he jahaan ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat kaa yaaol jameen par se gujarata he
 Eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in intense tropical cyclones
 jab chakravaat tivrata ke shikhar tak pahunch jate hai unamem aamtaur par ek iwal or adhiktam hawa kii trigya hoti he jo ek bahut chote aakaar main simat jaati he, jo lagbhag 10 kilometre se 25 kilometre tak hoti he
 The outer rainband can form an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly move inward and snatch the required moisture and angular momentum from the inner eyewall
 jab aantarik iwal kamazor pad jaataa he, ushnkaribandheey chakravaat bhi kamazor pad jaataa he bahari iwal aantarik iwal ko chakra ke ant main puri tarah se pratisthapit kar detaa he
 Thunderstorms can be of the same intensity as they were before, or may be even more intense after the eyewall replacement cycle is complete
 tufaan phir se teevr ho saktaa he kyonki vah agle yaaol pratisthaapan ke liye phir se ek nai bahari ring kaa nirmaan karata he
 The size of a tropical cyclone is determined by measuring the distance from its center to its outermost closed balance line, also known as ROCI
 yadi trigya aksharekha se do degree kam yaa 222 kilometre he, tab chakravaat "bahut chota" yaa ek "bouna" hota he
 a radius between 3 and 6 degrees of latitude or 333 kilometers to 670 kilometers is considered "average size"
 "bahut bade" ushnkaribandheey chakravaat 8 degree se bhi adhik yaa 888 kilometre kii ek trigya liye hue hote he
 The use of this measure has virtually determined that tropical cyclones of the Northwest Pacific Ocean are, on average, the largest on Earth and Atlantic tropical cyclones are about half their size
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat aakaar nirdhaaran kii anya vidhiyon main shaamil he aandhi ke bal vaali hawaaon ke trigya ko maapna or uski sambandhi vortisiti kshetra trigya ko maapna ek centre aandhi bal ke daayre main shaamil maapne hawaaon or maapne iske daayre main jo apane rishtedaar se −1 kshetra ke liye kam ho jaati he vorticity −5 1 × 10
 The primary energy source of a tropical cyclone is the heat of condensation emitted from condensed water vapor at extremely high altitudes, where solar heat is the initial source of evaporation
 isliye, ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ko ek vishaal urdhwadhar taap engine ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he jo prithvi ke gurutvkarshan or ghurnan jaise bhautik yantriki balon dwaara sanchalit hota he
 In another form, tropical cyclones can be seen as a special type of mesoscale convective complex, which continues to form over a vast source of relative moisture and heat
 jabaki ek praarambhik garm kor pranali, jaise ek sangathit toofaan sankul ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke gathan ke liye aavashyak he, vayumandaleey dabaav ko kam karne ke liye urja ke pravaah kii jarurat hoti he

 This positive response continues until conditions are favorable for tropical cyclone development
 aise kaarak jaise vaayu raashi ke vitaran main santulan kaa nirantar abhaav, chakravaat ke liye samarthan urja pradaan karegaa
 The rotation of the Earth induces the rotation of this system and this effect is known as the Coriolis effect, which gives it the characteristics of a cyclone and affects the direction of the storm
 jo tathy ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ko anya mausami ghatnaon se mukhya rup se pruthak karata he vah ek preran bal ke rup main gahan sanvahan
 kyonki sanvahan, ushnkaribandheey jalwaayu main majboot hota he, yah ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke praarambhik domen ko paribhaashit karata he
 In contrast, mid-latitude cyclones draw most of their energy from pre-existing horizontal temperatures
 apane taap ingine ko chalaate rahane ke liye, ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ko garm pani ke upar rahanaa chahie, jo jarurat ke vayumandaleey nami ko pradaan karata he taaki sakaaratmak pratikriya pash chaalu rahe
 When a tropical cyclone passes over land, its heat source is cut off from it and it loses its strength
 samudr ke upar se ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke guzarane se samudr kii upree parat kaaphi thandi ho jaati he, jo baad main chakravaat ke vikaas ko prabhavit kar sakati hai
 This cooling occurs mainly due to the rise of cold water from the depths of the ocean due to wind
 thanda pani toofaan ko kamazor banaata he
 It is a negative reinvestment process that weakens the storm over the ocean due to its own effect
 varsha ke jal se atirikt thandapan ho saktaa he kii dar se urja jari karata he, jo 1 PW ke baraabar he
 This energy discharge rate is 70 times the world's energy consumption and gives 200 times the worldwide electric potential or is equivalent to the detonation of a 10 megaton nuclear bomb per minute
 haalanki badalon kaa gaman spasht rup se kendra kii ore hota he, ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton main ek upree str par bhi badalon kaa pravaah viksit hota he
 This storm is generated at high altitude through the engine's "chimney" that the air expels through and through its moisture

 The clouds are quite thin and the sun can be seen through it
 ye ucch sirus badal, ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke ek praarambhik sanket ho sakate hai
 When the windstorm moves away from the eye of the storm, the tornado is reduced, then the outflow from a tropical cyclone will induce anti-cyclone motion

 Extensive research on the formation of tropical cyclones is an ongoing topic and is still not fully understood
 jabaki chah karkon ko aam taur par aavashyak ho dikhaai dete hai, ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton kabhi kabhi in sthitiyon ke sabhi mili bina farm saktaa he
 In most situations, the minimum water temperature is 26
5 ° C
 Needs are down to a depth of at least 50 m॰, this water temperature is sufficient to cause the atmosphere to cause overflowing thunderstorms and to maintain convection
 Another aspect is the rapid cooling with height, which allows a release of tropical forces that condensate heat
 High humidity is needed to center the troposphere, in particular, in the low, when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere, to adapt to disturbances and conditions are developed

 By most names, the hurricane activity band forms a worldwide tropical cyclone: the Intertropical Front, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or the monsoon trough
 Another important source of atmospheric instability is the tropical wave that is found, which causes about 85% of the intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean, and most become tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific basin

 Although tropical cyclones are large giant energy production systems, their movements over the Earth's surface are largely controlled by the rivers in the Earth's atmosphere by the winds

 The tropical system, while generally located at the equator of the 20th parallel ward, is steered to the westward high pressure zone of the continental side of the subtropical ridge, mainly an east-west side of the continent's oceans
 Waves in the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast of the Pacific Oceans, trade winds preceding the Pacific Pacific wind waves moving westward to the west for another name - tropical westward pointing towards the Central Coast and Caribbean Sea, North America and finally Africa To get wet out of There are many traders for these tropical cyclones within the area of these waves

 Storms moving towards Asia via the Pacific Ocean, for example, will divert offshore to the north, northeast of Japan and then, if the typhoon Siberia encounters blowing winds around a low pressure system over China
 Many tropical cyclones are subtly forced from cyclone to northeast, which in this manner move from northeast to west to east to the subtropical ridge
 a tropical example of a cyclone in recurve was a trajectory IOK storm in 2006, which looked similar

 When two cyclones approach each other, their centers will start orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems
 The two vortices will be attracted to each other and eventually spiral and merge at the center point
 When the two vortices are of uneven size, the interaction with the larger vortex will dominate and the smaller vortex will orbit around it

 Hurricanes have many fatalities in mountainous areas, as do the storms leading to torrential rains, and the deadly floods of mudslide, similar to those that occurred in 1998 with the Mitch storm
 Additionally, overhead dissipation can also occur if a storm remains in the same area of the ocean for long, mixing 60 meters of water

 Other approaches have suggested the time is under towing by tropical cyclones, including water cooling under icebergs
 In the tropical oceans, in addition to cyclone along with other ideas, evaporation prevents substances that cover a range of ocean or destroy nuclear weapons
 Project Cirrus Cyclone also involves throwing on a dry ice
 All of these approaches: One drawback above many sufferers is that tropical tropical cyclones are practical enough to do any technique to remain too large and small to weaken

 Intensive tropical cyclones pose a particular challenge, as they are a dangerous marine and weather station event, being relatively infrequent, are rarely available at the site of the storm itself
 Surface observations are generally available only if the storm is on an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship passing by

 In real-time measurements in place, reconnaissance flights in cyclones can be taken by sending specially equipped
 In the Atlantic Basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters
 The aircraft are used WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Oryons, both four-engine turboprop aircraft cargo
 These planes fly directly in the cyclone and carry direct and remote sensing measurements
 Cyclone Dropsonde also launched GPS inside the aircraft
 These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure and level of flight and especially winds between the ocean surface
 a new era in hurricanes began observing when the remotely controlled aircraft Erosonde, a small drone, was sent through the Ophelia storm as it passed the 2005 Hurricane Noise during the tropical weather of eastern Virginia
 One such mission was also successfully completed in the western Pacific Ocean

 The forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks, accurate predictions, depend on the position and strength of high and low pressure areas to determine the cause of the track, and how those areas predict how a tropical system will change during life
 Depth wind or average, mean flow through the deep layer troposphere, is considered the best tool in determining motion track and direction
 If the storms are significantly sheared, the use of wind measurements at a lower wind speed, altitude will yield better predictions
 The tropical storm economy also considers smoothing out the shorter than the period Wobbles as this trajectory allows them to determine a longer and more accurate trajectory

 However, scientists are not as efficient at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones
 The lack of improvement in intensity forecasts is attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and the factors that influence their development have an incomplete understanding

 Tropical cyclones are classified into three main groups, based on intensity: tropical depressions, tropical storms and a third group of more intense storms, whose name depends on the region
 For example, if a tropical storm in the northwest Pacific reaches the Beaufort power on the winds scale, the storm is referred to as a typhoon, if a tropical storm is in the Atlantic or in the nearby benchmark basin in the northeast Pacific, This is the one called storm
 Neither "hurricane" nor "typhoon" is performed in either the thunderstorm southern hemisphere or the Indian Ocean

 Additionally, as indicated in the table below, each basin terminology uses a different system, making it difficult to compare between different basins
 In the Pacific Ocean, storms across the Pacific Northwest date from the Pacific Northwest, sometimes becoming the central line in the Central Line; On rare occasions, the reverse will occur
 It should be greater than even with sustained winds that said typhoon 67 meters per second or 150 mph by the combined typhoon called Super Typhoon

 The eyeball is about the surrounding eyewall, an area about 16 kilometers to 80 kilometers wide which has a strong storm and the winds circulate around the storm
 Tropical cyclones in strong maximum sustained winds have been estimated at about 85 m per second or 195 mph

 The record on the most intense hurricane was the typhoon tip ocean in 1979, from which the constant wind speed reached a maximum maximum pressure of 870 mbar and 25
69 165 knot or 190 mph
 The tip, however, does not hold only for a record of sustained strong winds in the cyclone
 The storm currently shares this record with the Atlantic at Keith and North Pacific in Keith and Alan Keith
 Camille's land strike was the only hurricane in fact, while doing that, with intensity at 165 knots or 190 mph sustained winds and 183 knots or 210 mph gusts, the strongest tropical cyclone on landfall record
 Typhoon Nancy recorded in 1961 the wind speed was 185 knots or 215 mph, but recent research suggests that 1940s to 1940s have also been high for wind speeds and the highest speed winds on record are now storms
 Thoughts with
 Likewise, 205 knots or 235 mph were recorded in the gust due to a thunderstorm by Guam Paca at a surface level
 This was confirmed, but it would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever recorded on Earth's surface, the storm had to be discarded by reading the anemometer was damaged

 Proxy research based on paleotempestological records has shown that major hurricanes of activity along the Gulf Coast of Mexico have varied over the millennia over the timescales
 Some of the major Hurricanes 3000–1400 BC Hit the Gulf Coast during and again during the most recent millennium

 An extratropical cyclone is a type of storm that receives energy from a horizontal temperature abnormality, which is typical in high expanses
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat atiriktaushnkaribandheey ban sakate hai, kyonki yadi isaki urja strot, sanghanan dwaara jari garmi se vaayu khandon ke bich taapmaana main bhinnata paidaa karti he to yah upar kii ore vistaar karti he; iske alaava atiriktaushnkaribandheey chakravaat ushnkaribandheey tufaan main bhi tabadil ho sakate hai or uske baad ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ban jate hai, haalanki aisa aksar nahin hota

 yadi buddha, mahavir jaise naastik darshanik kapil se prabhavit hon to aashcharya nahin
 Among theistic philosophers, Vedanta, Yoga philosophy and mythology explicitly adopt the Trinitarianism and evolutionism of Sankhya
 is prakaar kapil pravartit sankhya kaa prabhaav praaia: sabhi darshanon par padaa he
 There has been controversy and research on what Kapil preached
 tatvasamasasutra ko uske tikaakar kapil dwaara rachit maanate hai
 The formulas are short and simple
 isiilie maxmooler ne unhen bahut pracheen batalaaya
 In the 8th century Jain text 'bhagavadjukkiyam', mentioning Sankhya is said - 'tatvasamasasutra' main bhi aisa hi paath miltaa he
 At the same time, commentator Bhavaganesh of Tattvasamasutra says that while writing the commentary, he has taken help from the Panchshikh written commentary
 richard garvey ke anusaar panchasikh kaa kaal pratham shatabdi kaa hona chahie
 Therefore, if we consider the commentary of Bhagavajujyakam and Bhavaganesh, the period of 'tattvamasasutra' can be taken till the first century of Christ
 iske purv isaki sthiti ke liye sabal pramaan kaa abhaav he
 Some commentators also consider the Sankhyaprakshasutra to be Kapil's work
 kaumudiprabha ke karta swapneshwar 'sankhyapravachansutra' ko panchasikh kii kriti maanate hai or kehete hai ki yah granth kapil dwaara nirmit isliye mana gaya he ki kapil sankhya ke pravartak hai
 The same thing can be said about 'tattvasamas'
 parantu sankhyapravachansutra kaa vivaran madhav ke 'sarvadarshansangrah' main nahin he or na to gunratn main hi iske aadhaar par sankhya kaa vivaran diya he
 Hence, scholars consider it to be a 14th century treatise
 lekin gita main inkaa zikr aane se ye or pracheen lagate hai
 Their time and place of birth cannot be decided
 bahut se vidwaanon ko to inaki aitihaasikta main hi andeh he
 They are mentioned in the Puranas and Mahabharata
 kaha jaataa he, prayek kalp ke aadi main kapil janm lete hai
 He attains all the accomplishments with birth
 isiilie inako adisiddh or adividvan kaha jaataa he
 His disciple has been described as a yearly Shrotriya Brahmin born in a dynasty called Asuri
 parampara ke anusaar ukt asuri ko nirmaanchitt main adhishthit hokar inhone tatvagyan kaa upadesh diya tha
 Nirmanichitta means to make one's mind voluntarily by accomplishment
 isse maaloom hota he, kapil ne asuri ke saamne saakshaat upasthit hokar upadesh nahin diya apitu asuri ke gyaan main inke pratipaadit siddhanton kaa sphuran hua, at: ye 'asuri' ke guru kehalaae
 In the Mahabharata, he has been called the speaker of Sankhya
 inako agni kaa avatar or brahma kaa manasaputra bhi puraanon main kaha gaya he
 According to Srimad Bhagwat, Kapil is considered the fifth avatar of Vishnu
 kardam or devhooti se inaki utpatti maani gai he
 Later he preached Sankhya Gyan to his mother Devahuti, whose detailed description is found in the third wing of Srimad Bhagwat
 kapilwastu, jahaan buddha paidaa hue the, kapil ke naam par basaa nagar tha or sagar ke putr ne sagar ke kinare kapil ko dekha or unka shaap paaya tathaa baad main vahiin ganga kaa sagar ke saath sangam hua
 This suggests that Kapil's birthplace was probably Kapilavastu and austerity Gangasagar
 isse kam-se-kam itnaa to avashya kah sakate hai ki buddha ke pehle kapil kaa naam fail chukaa tha
 If we consider the centipede of Kapil's disciple, Asuri, as integral to the Brahmin's asuri, we can say that Kapil's position must have been at least in the Brahmin period

 kapil kaa kaal mana ja saktaa he
 The aim of Sankhya Shastra is to attain salvation through philosophy
 brahman granthon main yagyakarm ke dwaara apvarg kii prapti batalaai gai he
 The greatest feature of Sankhya is to give importance to Jnanakanda as opposed to ritual
 upanishdon main gyaan ko karm se shreshth mana gaya he
 Although in most of the Upanishads, Brahma has been described as an extreme entity and the world as the result or converse; In some Upanishads, however, the principles of Samkhya are mainly represented
 parantu yah pratipaadan krambaddh rup main nahin he, keval kuch aise siddhanton kii ore sanket karata he jiskaa aage chalakar sankhya siddhant main samavesh ho gaya
 The meaning of calling Kapil as Adisiddh or Siddhesh is that it was probably Kapil who first showed the path of meditation and penance
 unke pehle karm hi ek maarg tha or gyaan keval charchaa tak simit tha
 By giving knowledge as a form of spiritual practice, Kapil distinguished sacrifice, penance and samadhi for the first time in Indian culture
 sankhya main prakruti or purush ye do tatv maane gaye hai
 Nature is said to be made up of these three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas
 trigun kii samyavastha, prakruti or inke vaishamy se sristi hoti he
 There is nothing new in the universe, everything originates from nature
 sansar prakruti kaa parinaam maatr he
 Sankhya has fame as a promoter of hospitality and consequentialism
 purush ke sannidhi maatr se prakruti main vaishamy hone se sristi hoti he
 Nature is the root - Purusha is the conscious, Prakriti is the doer - Purusha is passive
 langade or andhe ke sanyog kii tarah purush or prakruti kaa sanyog he
 The man is conscious and seeing his image in nature, considers himself to be the doer and suffers from this ignorance in the bond of ignorance, attains fascination
 jis samay purush ko gyaan ho jaataa he ki vah karta nahin he, nirlypt, kutasth sakshi maatr he, prakruti kaa naatay uske liye samaapt ho jaataa he
 To be free from ignorant bondage and to know one's own form is Kaivalya or Moksha and this is the ultimate effort
 mukt hone par mukt purush ke liye prakruti mahatvaheen he parantu anya sansari purush ke liye vah satya he kyonki prakruti kaa naash nahin hota
 This is the reason why Nana is considered a male in Sankhya
 puraanon tathaa 'sankhyapravachansutra' ke anusaar purushon ke upar ek purushottam bhi mana gaya he
 It gives salvation to Purushottam or God Purush
 parantu pracheenatam uplabdh sankhya granth 'sankhyakarika' ke anusaar ishwar ko sankhya main sthaan nahin he
 Apparently Kapil was also a naturalist, Sesvara Samkhya developed later
 sankhya main pachis tatv maane gaye hai
 Purusha, the purified nature of man, arises out of importance or intelligence, intelligence from ego, ego from five tantras or subtle ghosts and mind, from five tantras, five gyan senses, five karmadriyas and five macros are generated
 inamen se prakruti kisi se utpann nahin he, mahat ahankaar or tanmatraayen, ye saat prakruti se utpann hai or duusare tatwon ko utpann bhi karte hai
 The remaining sixteen elements are only generated, do not give birth to any new element
 at: ye solah vikaar maane jate hai, prakruti avikari he, mahat aadi saat tatv swayan vikari hai or vikaar utpann bhi karte hai
