 Above the temple, a huge piece of mountain rock has moved outward, which looks like it will fall on the temple

 To get into it, one has to walk through a wooden walkway, so that the pressure of the foot makes the sound of the wooden path, but the temple adjacent to the rock does not budge at all

 hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world
 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language
 in vibhinn bhashaayon ke shabdon ke rup isliye milte-julate the kyonki yah ek hi pracheen jad se utpann hue sajaateey shabd the
 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european

 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below
 hind europea shakhaon ko mukhyatah do virgon main rakhaa jaataa he : kentum varg or saatam varg
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh
 saath hi saath, aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 These include the Baltic, Slavic, indo-iranian, Armenian, and Albanian branches

 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Qu, Gw and Gv were preserved in the same way
 aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 At that time, the indus-valley civilization was destroyed either by earthquakes or by changes in the current of indus-saraswati rivers and due to drought

 This view is considered by many Indians and Hindutva-plaintiffs, but in the rest of the world, this view is not valued

 By the way, there are no similar words found in Greek, Latin, German and other indo-european languages for the words of Indian climate and animals, such as peacock, cock, tiger, elephant, mango, banana, peepal, banyan, neem, hot Mausam, ganda, buffalo, rice, etc

 bioshock ek bhutaha pratham-vyakti shooter video game he, jise irrational games dwaara viksit kiya gaya he- tab iskaa naam 2ke boston / 2ke australia tha- tathaa ise ken lewine ne dizine kiya he
 The game was released on 21 August 2007 in North America for the Windows operating system and Xbox 360 video game console, and three days later in Europe and Australia
 is khel kaa ek plastesan 3 sanskaran, jise 2ke marin ne viksit kiya tha, ko antarrashtriya str par 17 oktober 2008 ko or uttari america main 21 oktober 2008 ko kuch atirikt visheshtaon ke saath release kiya gaya
 On 21 August 2007 it became available on Steam
 7 oktober 2009 ko yah khel mike oes eks oparating system ke liye bhi release kiya gaya
 a version of this game for the mobile platform is currently being developed by IG Fun
 iskaa aglaa bhaag, bioshock 2, 9 farvari 2010 ko release kiya gaya
 Based on an alternate history of the 1960s, the player plays the role of a survivor in a plane crash called Jack, searching for a submerged city called Rapture and the attacks of mutated creatures and driverless machine aircraft that live in that city
 It is necessary to avoid
 is khel main bhoomika-khelon or bachaav-khelon main paye jane vaale tatv sammilit hai or vikasakartaaon tathaa lewine ne iskaa ullekh system shock shrinkhalaa ke unke pichley sheershakon ke "aadhyatmik anuvarthi" ke rup main kiya he
 The game received overwhelmingly positive responses, praising its "morality-based" script, immersion-filled atmosphere, and an anthology-inspired narrative
 bioshock bhoomika-khel ke liye vishisht rup se nirmit tatwon tathaa gopneey tatwon ke saath ek pratham-vyakti shooter khel he or yah system shock 2 ke samaan he
 The player plays the role of Jack, whose goal is to move forward on the path leading to the Rapture, using weapons and plasmids to accomplish his objectives
 kuch avasaron par, suraksha camaron or swachaalit burjon dwaara pahachaane jane se bachane ke liye khilaadi gopneey tarkeebon kaa prayog bhi kar saktaa he
 While searching for the Rapture, the player collects money, which can be used to obtain weapons, health, and additional equipment at various vending machines
 khilaadi ko kuch khule purze bhi milte hai, jinka prayog "you-invent" mashiinon par naye hathiyaaron yaa prayojya vastuon ke nirmaan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Cameras, bastions, chests, some locks and vending machines, etc
 can all be hacked for the player's benefit, such as activating the player's enemies, informing the player of their items, or buying the player with a discount
 Occur
 hekking ke liye khilaadi ko simit samay main pipe menia jaisaa ek laghu-khel purna karnaa padataa he
 At the beginning of the game, the player is given an "investigative camera", which allows Jack to snap and analyze his enemies, with better quality photos providing more profitable analysis
 kisi shatru kaa paryaapt vishleshan kar lene par, bhavi ladaaiyon main us prakaar ke shatru se saamana hone par khilaadi ko adhik kshati, jin tonic or anya bonus diye jate hai
 "vita-chambers" made of glass walls can also be seen throughout the game, which the player does not directly use
 iske bajaay, yadi jaik kii maut ho jaae, to uske sharir ko nikatatam chembar main punarnirmit kiya jaataa he, jiske baad uski sari vasteen kaayam rahati hai, lekin uske purna swasthya kaa keval ek bhaag hi shesh bachataa he
 In one part of the game, the player has the option of disabling the use of these vita-chambers, so that if Jack dies, the player will have to restart from any accumulated game
 khilaadi anek plasmid or jin tonic ekatrit va aavantit kar saktaa he, jo jaik ko vishesh akramanon ko ujagar karne kii kshamta dete hai athwa sudhaarit swasthya yaa hekking kaushalon jaise kuch apratyaksh laabh pradaan karte hai
 "active" plasmids — those introduced by the player as the most aggressive plasmids — require some amount of Eve serum to be used as magic numbers; Eve can be replenished through syringes
 ye plasmid khilaadi kii dikhaawat ko bhi badal dete hai, jo ki "swayan kii maanavtaa kaa tyaag karne" ko pratibimbit karata he
 "tonic" are indirect plasmids and no ewe is required to gain their benefit; The player can only be equipped with a limited amount of plasmids and tonics at any time
 yah khel plasmidon, hathiyaaron or vaataavaran ke prayog ke ek rachanaatmak sangyojan ke prayog ko protsaahit karata he
 Throughout the script, plasmids can be collected at certain points in the city, but they are mostly purchased by the player using "adam Mutagen" from the Little Sisters at "gathers Gardens"
 adam mutajin ko ekatrit karne ke liye khilaadi ko pehle "big daddy" -jaivik rup se unnat manushya, jinhen ek hathiyaarband diving suut ke saath jod diya gaya he- ko haraana anivaary hota he, jo prayek little sistar ke saath rahete hai va uski raksha karte hai
 The player then has a moral choice: either kill Little Sister to gain a lot of Adam, or save Little Sister's life and only get a small amount of money, though each saves three sisters
 a large amount of Adam is given to the player as a prize
 haalanki donon vikalpon ke apane laabh hai, lekin naitik mulyon ke bich takaraav kaa yah tatv patakatha par or anya baton ke saath-saath, puure khel kii kathinata par prabhaav daalata he
 bioshock is set in the backdrop of the 1960s, in a submerged fantasy city called Rapture
 khel ke dauraan jaise-jaise khilaadi shahar kaa anveshan karata jaataa he, vaise-vaise use audio ricarding ke madhyam se rapchar kaa itihaas gyaat hota jaataa he
 The Rapture was conceived by wealthy businessman Andrew Ryan, who wanted to build a non-interventionist state to avoid ever-increasing political, economic and religious authority over the land
 gupt rup se 1946 main madhya-atlantic samudr-tal main shahar kaa nirmaan kar liya gaya, jise jal kii gaharaai main sthit jwalamukhiyon se bhu-ooshmiya vidyut-shakti praapt hoti thi
 Scientific advances in Rapture continued to progress, leading to rapid development in engineering and biotechnology, some of which goes to the intelligent scientists brought to the city by Ryan
 aisi hi ek unnati adam, samudri ghonghe kii ek purv-gyaat prajati se nirmit stem cell, the jinaki khoj dow brijet tennenbom ne kshatigrast utakon ke punarnirmaan or maanviya jinom ke punarlekhan kii kshamta viksit karne ke liye kii thi
 Tenenbaum, together with businessman and Gunday Frank Fontaine, created the plasmid industry, providing hyper-human physical growth to its consumers
 tennenbom ne paaya ki ghonghe ko yadi choti bacchiyon, jo ki fontan dwaara sthapit anathalayon se lee gayi thim, ke pet main viksit kiya jaae, to adam kaa utpaadan bade paimaane par kiya ja saktaa he
 Over time, the gap between rich and poor widened
 frank fontine ne garibon kii sahaayta ke liye dharmarth sanghathanon kii sthapana kii
 His motives were far from benevolence; His original goal was to use his charitable organizations to exploit the poor
 usne ek taskar giroh kii bhi sthapana kii, sataha se jo nagarikon ko pratibandhit vastuon, jaise dharmik saamagree, kii aapurti karata tha
 All of this and his control over the plasmid industry, made him very powerful
 usne rayaan kaa takhta palat karne kii koshish kii, lekin is vidroh ko nirmamtapurvak kuchal diya gaya or khabar mili kii fontan ko maar diya gaya he
 Ryan took over Fontaine's plasmid trade
 kuch hi maheenon ke bheetar, atlas naamak ek paatr asantusht nimna-varg ke netaa ke rup main ubhara
 On the eve of the New Year of 1959, Atlas and his Adam-influenced followers started a new rebellion against Ryan, which spread throughout the Rapture
 iske jawaab main rayaan ne apni swayan kii senaaon ko jodna prarambh kar diya or uskaa pidanonmad aise str tak pahunch gaya tha ki usne rapchar ke mukhya chowk par darjanon logon ko faansee par lataka diya, jinamein se adhikansh nirdosh the
 To deal with the lack of Adam, the Little Sisters have a mental state designed to roam the city to remove the Adam from the dead and recycle it as raw Adam in their stomach after swallowing it
 anek plasmidon ke nirmaataa vaigyanik dow suchong ne little sisters ke kaary main unki raksha karne ke liye "big daddies", hathiyaarband diving suut pahane hue parishkrut or maansik rup se anurvar manushya, kaa nirmaan kiya
 One drawback of Adam is that if the user does not consume it regularly, then he suffers from mental and physical disorders
 chunki yuddh ke kaaran utpaadan or aapurti baadhit ho gai thi, atah shahar main adam kaa prayek prayokta antat hinsak rup se unmaadi ban gaya
 By the time the player enters, only a few non-converting humans remain at the frontier
 khel kii shuruuaat main, khilaadi-paatr jaik ek vimaan kaa yatri he, jo 1960 main, rapchar kii samaajik vyavastha ke patan ke baad, atlantic mahaasaagar main dub jaataa he
 Upon reaching the surface, Jack finds that he alone is the only survivor of the accident, and he swims to the nearest lighthouse tower on an island, where he finds a cradle, using which he can reach the depths of the ocean
 Rapture enters the city
 atlas naamak ek irish vyakti us krodmandal main mili seva radio kaa prayog karke jaik ko surakshit sthaan par pahunchane main sahaayta karata he
 Meanwhile, Ryan attempts to assassinate Jack by using Jack Rapture's automated systems and his pheromone-controlled splicers, assuming Jack to be a country agent on the surface
 atlas jaik ko bataata he ki plasmidon dwaara pradaan kii jane vaali kshamtaaon kaa prayog karnaa hi uske bachane kaa ekmaatr upaay he or little sisters kaa adam hasil karne ke liye use unki hatya kerani hogi
 Coincidentally, Dr
 Tenenbom overhears Atlas' words and gives her a plasmid, requesting to protect the Little Sisters rather than kill them, which will transfer the intertwined sea snails into each sister
 atlas kahata he ki uski patni or baccha ek pandubbi main chhipe hue hai or jaik ko uski ore bhejtaa he
 Ryan destroys it as soon as Jack and Atlas reach the bay where it is standing; The enraged Atlas asks Jack to assassinate Ryan
 ek kritrim van ko nasht hone se bachaane or ek murti banane main besudh kalakaar kii sahaayta karne jaise kaaryon ko puraa karne ke baad antat jaik rayaan ke karyaalay main uskaa saamana karata he, jo aaraam se golf khel rahaa he
 Ryan tells her the truth, which she has created by piecing together several pieces
 vastav main jaik kaa janm keval do varsh purv rapchar main hi hua tha or use genetic rup se parivartit kar diya gaya, taaki vah tezi se paripakv ho jaae
 He is the illegitimate son of Ryan, born to a love affair with a dancer named Jasmine Jolyn
 jab jolin garbhvatee ho gai or jaik uske garbh main tha, tab dhan kii atyadhik aavashyaktaa ke chalate usne shasr-kriya ke dwaara apana bhrun nikalava kar sabase oonchi boli lagane vaale vyakti ko bech diya
 She did not realize that the person buying her son was Frank Fontaine, which resulted in her being murdered by the angry Ryan
 rayaan aage bataata he ki jaik ke bhrun ko kharidne ke baad, fontan ne uski rachana is tarah kii ki vah ek vishisht vaakyansh "kya tum kripaya


" ke saath shuru hone vaale adeshon kaa paalan kare
 When the war starts, Ryan is sent to the surface to save Jack from his reach
 jab fontan or rayaan ke bich takaraav ek gatirodh par pahunch gaya, to jaik ko ek package ke saath ek vimaan main savaar hone or vimaan kaa apharan karke use prakaash-stambh ke sameep krash karne ke liye package kii saamagree, ek pistaul, kaa prayog karne ke nirdesh bheje gayi, taaki vah lautakar rapchar aa sake or fontan ek hathiyaar ke rup main uskaa prayog kare
 Since Jack was Ryan's son, he could freely use Rapture's Cromodern Network, which has been banned for all but those within Ryan's "genetic realm"
 antat, apni swayan kii sharton ke anusaar marane kii ichha karte hue rayaan jaik ko uski hatya karne detaa he
 After Ryan's death, Jack realizes that Atlas has been using that specific phrase to control him, but by then it is too late
 jaik ke samaksh atlas swayan ko fontan ke rup main ujagar karata he, jisane rayaan dwaara peechha kiye jane se bachane or shahar kaa niyantran apane haathon main lene ke liye apni maut kaa naatak kiya tha or vah jaik ko punarskriy suraksha pranaaliyon kii krupa ke bharose chhod detaa he
 Dr
 Tenenbaum and his Little Sisters assist Jack in escaping from the exhaust system, where he falls unconscious
 jab tak jaik ko hosh aae, uske purv hi dow tennenbom uski kuch anukulit pratikriyaaon ko niskriy kar chuki hoti hai or shesh ko todane main uski sahaayta karti hai, jinamein se ek ne antat uske dil kii dhadkan band kar di hoti
 When it is clear to Fontaine that he is losing control of Jack, Fontaine mentions the bizarre fact that Tenenbom survived both World War II and the Battle of Rapture as a fire scandal
 Has gone and cleverly indicates that he has an agenda of his own
 little sisters kii sahaayta se jaik fontan ko haraane main safal ho jaataa he
 When sidelined, Fontaine injects a large amount of Adam into his body and becomes an inhuman demon
 jaik fontan ke saath yuddh karata he or antat prabal ho jaataa he, jisase little sisters ko fontan ko apane vash main karke uske sharir se adam nikaal lene kaa mauka miltaa he, jisase uski maut ho jaati he
 Three endings of the game are possible based on the player's behavior with the Little Sisters, all three of which are told by Dr
 Tenenbaum
 yadi kisi khilaadi kisi sistar kii hatya nahin kii yaa keval ek hi sistar kii hatya kii he, to ant main jaik ke saath sataha par lautati hui paanch little sisters dikhaai detii hai, jo ki apana puraa jivan uski dekh-rekh main jiti hai, jisamen unki mahavidhyalayan shiksha puri karnaa, shaadi karnaa or santan utpann karnaa shaamil he; yah dil ko chhu lene vaali ek dhun ke saath samaapt hota he or hamen paanchon vayask little sisters se ghira hua jaik mrityu-shaiyya par padaa dikhaai detaa he
 If the player has harvested all or almost all of the Little Sisters, Jack turns to them after defeating Fontaine and ends the game assuming that he has killed them all and taken away all their Adam
 tennenbom bataati hai ki kya hua he or gusse va apmaan se bhare swar main jaik kii ninda karti hai
 Later on the other end, a George Washington-class submarine carrying nuclear missiles approaches the wreckage of the aircraft and is suddenly surrounded by crewmembers, carrying the splicers
 ye splisar pandubbi main savaar sabhi logon kii hatya kar dete hai or iskaa niyantran apane haathon main le lete hai
 If the player has killed more than one Little Sister, but has not reached the previous end, the ending is visually similar to the other end, although this time Tenenbaum's tone would be sad rather than the wrathful tone of the previous one
 And there is a slight difference in their dialogues
 mul rup se, bioshock kii patakatha iske release kiye gayi sanskaran kii patakatha se bahut adhik bhinn thi: iskaa mukhya paatr ek "sanakee deprogrammer"- kisi vyakti ko ek sampradaay se bachaane or us vyakti ko maansik va manovaigyanik rup se saamaanya jivan jeene ke liye samyojit karne kii dhun se grast ek vyakti- tha
 For example, Ken Levine gives an example of what an eccentric diprogrammer does "" There are people who have hired people to deprogram their daughter who was in a homosexual relationship
 ve uskaa apharan kar lete hai or use punahprogram karte hai or vastav main yah ek gudh vyakti tha or tum yahi paatr the
 The character of this story would have been more political, in which the character's services were taken by an MP
 By the time the development on Bioshock was officially announced in 2004, its narrative and background had changed drastically
 ab yah khel dwitiya vishwa-yuddh kii ek parityakt bhumigat prayog shaala main khelaa jaataa he, jise ikkisvin sadi ke vaigyanikon ne abhi haal hi main zamin se baahar nikaala he
 Genetic research going on within the laboratory has built itself into an ecosystem centered around three "species" of organisms, referred to as "driverless aircraft", "soldiers" and "predators"
 have taken
 antat yah "kritrim paristhitiki" gatyaatmak khel main dikhaai dene vaali "little sisters", "big daddy" or "splisar" ke liye aadhaar kaa nirmaan karegi
 Although the gameplay of this story was similar to the released version of the game, there were changes to its narrative that, according to Levine, were consistent with the game's then-irrational director theory of putting the game's design first
 lewine ne is baat kaa bhi ullekh kiya ki "khel ke liye do ant bananaa kabhi bhi meraa iraadaa nahin tha
 In a way, this idea came much later and it was something that someone above me in the food chain had requested
 ek saakshaatkaar ke dauraan khel kii katha or prishthbhumi ke bare main gaming website ijien dwaara puche gayi ek prashn ke uttar main lewine ne kaha, "mere paas mukt-kala kii meri anupayogi oopaadhi he, atah maine ain rand or jorge orwel kii saamagree or beesvin sadi kaa sabhi tarah kaa adarshavaadi va manahuus lekhan padhaa, jo sachmuch mujhe dilachasp laga
 "levine also mentions his interest in" stem cell research and related ethical issues "
 kalatmak prabhaav ke sandarbh main, lewine ne nintine anti-four or logans ran pustakon kaa ullekh kiya he, jo ki aise samaajon kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai, jinke paas "vastav main kuch dilachasp vichaar hai, jo is tathy ke dwaara vikrut ho gayi hai ki ham log hai
 " vikasakartaaon ke anusaar, bioshock, system shock khelon kaa ek aadhyatmik anuvarthi he or iskaa utpaadan usee shrinkhalaa ke purv vikasakartaaon dwaara kiya gaya tha
 Levine claims that from the time he created System Shock 2, his team had been considering creating another game of the same kind
 pehali baar i3 2006 main pradarshit ek video ke apane varnan main, lewine ne in khelon ke bich anek samaantaaon kii ore suchit kiya he
 They have many comparable gameplay elements: the plasmids offered by "eve Hypnos" in bioshock perform the same function as the "cyanic abilities" offered by "PSI Hypnos" in System Shock 2; In both games the player has to compete with security cameras, machine gun bastions and has the ability to break into them; War content protection has been cited as "a key feature of gameplay"; And the audio tape recording narrating the story fulfills the same role that was played by e-mail records in System Shock games
 ekaadhik shasr prakaaron vaale sanshodhaneey hathiyaaron or adhik kshati pahunchane ke liye shatru ko dhundne kii samanta kii hi tarah “system shock 2 main prayukt “ghost” bioshock main bhi upasthit hai
 Additionally, Atlas guides the player through the radio in almost the same way as Janice Polito in System Shock 2, giving each of these characters a similar turn between games
 donon hi khel khilaadi ko kaaryon kii purti kii ek se adhik vidhiyaan pradaan karte hai, jisase aakasmik gemple kaa mauka miltaa he
 bioshock uses a highly modified version of the Unreal Engine 2
5 technology, which was used in previous titles of international games including Swat 4 and Swat 4: The Sketchkov Syndicate
 may 2006 main i3 main ek saakshaatkaar ke dauraan lewine ne ghoshnaa kii ki anariyal ingine 3

 "critical improvement has been praised by critics and gamespot has said," Whether it is stagnant water on the floor or boiling seawater after an explosion, every time you see it, it will take you away
 ” yadi system direct3di 10 kii hardware va software aavashyaktaaon kii purti karata ho, to bioshock kaa vindos sanskaran inaki visheshta or saamagree kar prayog kar saktaa he, lekin atirikt prabhaav ke bina yah directex 9 par bhi chalegaa
 There are some differences in picture quality between these two apis, such as additional water reflection and micro-particle effects, however, from the player's point of view these differences are very subtle
 bioshock, havok phijics, ek ingine jo khel kii aantarik bhautikee main sudhaar karne or ragdol bhautikee ke ekikaran kii anumati detaa he, kaa prayog karata he or vaataavaran ke tatwon kii gatividhiyon ko adhik vaastavik rup se darshane kii kshamta pradaan karata he
 bioshock's lead programmer, Chris Kline, considers Bioshock to be "highly multidimensional" because it consists of the following elements acting independently: 12 agast 2007 ko exbox live marketspls par iskaa ek demo release kiya gaya or pisi demo 20 agast 2007 ko aadhikarik rup se release hua or isaki ghoshnaa unke podcast par ken lewine ke saath laire rib ke saakshaatkaar ke dauraan kii gai
 The demo consists of the first 4–5 minutes of play and includes a dynamic introductory sequence that established the setting and the opening lines of the screenplay and didactic phase of the game

 Bay trees are difficult to grow from seed, partly because of the low seed germination rate and long germination period
 The germination rate of freshly removed pods is typically 40%, while the germination rate of seeds including dried seeds and / or pods is even lower

 This tendency is called inertia

 The second feature of the rotor of a rotary rotary is the protraction
 paribhraman karte hue kisi pind ke koniya samveg main parivartan karne ke liye ek balaghurna aavashyak hota he
 If the axes of the thrust and angular momentum are coincident, then an angular acceleration is produced in that body, but the plane of rotation of that body remains unchanged
 iske vipareet yadi ukt donon aksh paraspar sam-konik hote hai, to pind ke koniya veg main koi antar nahin aata, kintu paribhraman kaa tal swayan hi ghoomane lagata he

 It is due to angular momentum that the properties of firmness and inertia are included in the rotational system
 kisi pind par jab koi balyugma kaary karata he, tab us pind main balyugma ke aksh ke chaaron ore ek koniya samveg utpann ho jaataa he, jiske kaaran pind main us aksh ke chaaron or bhrami karne kii pravriti utpann ho jaati he
 The angular velocity of that body will increase as long as it continues to work
 nimnlikhit sameekaran ghurnakshadarshi ke gun ko abhivyakt karata he- Where the vector τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau}}} and l → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {L}}} are the convolutional and angular momentum superimposed on the rotoscope, respectively
 adish i iskaa jadtwaghurna he, sadish ω → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ omega }}} iskaa koniya veg he, or sadish α → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ alpha }}} koniya twaran he
 It is clear from this equation that if the rotating τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau}}} is placed perpendicular to the rotating-axis, it causes τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau}}} and l → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {L}}} will generate vertical displacement of both
 is gati ko purassaran kehete hai
 The angular velocity of the precession will be the following: maan liya, ek baari chakra ek kshaitij dhuree k-kha par nartan kar rahaa he
 The two forces f and f at both ends of the axis are acting in such a way that a forcem is formed from them

 If a rotator is placed at a location on the earth plane in such a way that its land axis is horizontal in the east-west direction, the earth's revolutions as well as its entire structure will revolve around the center of the earth, because each time the surface of that structure Will remain perpendicular to the earth plane

 firoz shah tululaq dilli sultanate main tululaq vansh kaa shaasha tha
 Ferozeshah Tughlaq was born on 1309
 wo bharat par antim muslim shaasha tha
 He ruled from 1351 to 1388
 wo, dipalpur kii hidun rajkumaari kaa putr tha
 He forced many Hindus to adopt Muslim religion during his rule
 usne apane shasankaal main hi chaandi ke sikke chalaaye| firozshah tululaq, mohammad tululaq kaa chachera bhai evam sipahsalaar 'rajab' kaa putr tha
 His mother 'bibi Jaizella' was the daughter of Rajput chieftain Rajamal
 mohammad tululaq kii mutyu ke baad 20 march 1351 ko firoz tululaq kaa rajbhishak thatta ke nikat hua
 Feroze was crowned again in Delhi in August, 1351
 sultan banane ke baad firozshah tululaq ne sabhi qarze maaf kar die, jisamen 'sondhar rin' bhi shaamil tha, jo mohammad tululaq ke samay kisaanon ko diya gaya tha
 After becoming Sultan, Feroze Tughlaq invaded Bengal and Sindh as part of his campaign to conquer his territories separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal ko jeetne ke liye sultan ne 1353 i
 main akraman kiya
 At that time, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah was the ruler of that place
 usne ikdala ke qile main sharan le rakhi thi, sultan firoz antatah qile par adhikaar karne main asafal hokar 1355 i
 main waapas dilli aa gaya
 Again in 1359 AD, Firuz Tughlaq attacked Sikandar Shah, the son of the then ruler Shamsuddin, in an attempt to take control of Bengal, but failed once again
 1360 i main sultan firoz ne ‘jajanagar’ par akraman karke vahaan ke shaasha bhanudev tritiy ko parrast kar puri ke jagannatha mandir puri ko dhwast kiya
 In 1361 AD, Feroze attacked Nagarkot
 yahan ke jambabaniyon se ladati hui sultan kii sena lagbhag 6 maheene tak ran ke registan main fasi rahi, kaalaantar main jambabaniyon ne sultan kii adheenta ko sweekaar kar liya or vaarshik kar dene ke liye sahamat ho gayi
 Apart from these simple victories, there has been no major success in the name of Feroze
 usne dakshin main swatantra hue rajya vijaynagar, bahamani evam madura ko punah jeetne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Thus it can be said that Sultan Firuz Tughlaq did not undertake any military campaign during his reign for the expansion of the empire and whatever campaign he did, only to save the empire
 rajasav vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne apane shashan kaal main 24 kshtdaayak karon ko samaapt kar diya or keval 4 kar ‘karaaj’, ‘khums’, ‘jazia’, evam 'zakaat' ko vasuul karne kaa aadesh diya
 On the orders of the Ulama, the Sultan also imposed a new irrigation tax, which charged 1 / 10 of the produce
 sambhavtah firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal main lagaan upaj kaa 1 / 5 se 1 / 3 bhaag hota tha
 To facilitate irrigation, the Sultan built 5 big canals from the Yamuna River to Hisar, 150 miles long from the Sutlej River to the Ghaggar River, from the hill of Sirmour to the Hansi, from Ghaggar to Firozabad and from Yamuna to Firozabad
 usne falo ke lagbhag 1200 baag lagavaaye
 Abolished many taxes to increase internal trade
 nagar evam saarvajanik nirmaan kaaryon ke antargat sultan ne lagbhag 300 naye nagaron kii sthapana kii
 Among these, Hisar, Firozabad, Fatehabad, Jaunpur, Firozpur etc
 were prominent
 in nagaron main yamuna nadi ke kinare basaaya gaya firozabad sultan ko sarvaadhik priy tha
 The foundation of Jaunpur city was laid by Firoz in memory of his cousin 'fakhruddin Jauna'
 uske shashan kaal main khijrabad evam meerut se ashok ke do stambhalekhon ko laakar dilli main sthapit kiya gaya
 Under his welfare works, Firoz set up an employment office and a new department called diwan-e-khairat to help Muslim orphans, widows and girls
 'daarul-shafa' naamak ek rajkeey aspataal kaa nirmaan karavaaya, jisamen garibon kaa muft ilaaj hota tha
 During the reign of Firoz, the number of slaves reached about 1,80,000
 inaki dekhbhaal hetu sultan de 'dewan-e-bandaraan' kii sthapana kii
 Some slaves were sent to the provinces and the rest were kept in the center
 daason ko nakad vetan yaa bhukhand die gayi
 Slaves were also given handcraft training
 sainya vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne sainikon punah jaagir ke rup main vetan dena prarambh kar diya
 He made military posts hereditary, affecting the ability of soldiers to check
 khums kaa 4 / 5 bhaag phir se sainikon ko dene ke aadesh die gayi
 After some time his terrible result came to light
 firoz tululaq ko kuch itihaaskaar dharmandh evam ashishnu shaasha maanate hai
 Probably he was the first Sultan of Delhi Sultanate, who followed strict Islamic rules and gave importance to the Ulema class in administrative work
 nyaay vyavastha par punah dharmaguruon kaa prabhaav sthapit ho gaya
 Mukti used to explain the laws
 musalmaan aparaadhiyon ko mrityu dand dena band kar diya gaya
 Feroze was a staunch Sunni Muslim
 usne hindu janata ko ‘jimmy’ kaha or hindu brahmanon par jazia kar lagaaya
 Dr
 R
C
 Majumdar has stated that, "firuz was the most fanatical of this era and the Sinkadar Lodi and Aurangzeb in this region was outgoing
 ’ dilli sultanate main pratham baar firoz tululaq ne brahmanon se bhi jazia liya
 In the field of education, Sultan Firoz established many tombs and madrasas
 usne 'jiyauddin barani' evam 'shams-e-siraaj afif' ko apana sangrakshan pradaan kiya
 Barani composed 'fatwa-e-jahandari' and 'date-e-firozshahi'
 firoz ne apni aatmakatha ‘phutuhat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kii jabaki ‘sirat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kisi agyaat viddhan dwaara kii gai he
 Firoz translated some of the 1300 texts looted from the library of the Jwalamukhi temple under the name 'dalaiyte-firozshahi' by Eduddin
 'valaile-firozshahi' ayurveda se sambandhit granth tha
 He invented the water clock
 firoz kaal main khan-i-jahaan telgani ke makbara kii tulana jerusalem main nirmit umr ke maszid se kii jaati he
 Sultan Firoz Tughlaq built Kotla Feroz Shah Durg in Delhi
 apane bhai jona khaan kii smriti main jonpur naamak shahar basaaya
 Sultan Ferozeshah Tughlaq himself encouraged bribery in the administration
 afif ke anusaar-sultan ne ek ghudsavaar ko apane khazaane se ek taka diya, taaki vah rishwat dekar arj main apane ghode ko paas karvaa saken
 Firoz Tuglaq was the first ruler of the Sultanate who got the details of the man of the state
 khwaja hisamuddin ke ek anumaan ke anusaar- firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal kii vaarshik aay 6 karod 75 lakh takaad Firoz Tughlaq issued a large number of coins made of a mixture of copper and silver under the currency system, which were probably called 'adha' and 'egypt'
 firoz tululaq ne ‘shanshgani’ kaa nayaa sikaa chalavaaya tha
 He inscribed the name of his son or successor 'fatah Khan' with his name on the coins
 firoz ne apane ko caliph kaa nib pukaara tathaa sikkon par caliph kaa naam ankit karavaaya
 The rule of Ferozeshah Tughlaq was based on welfare autocracy
 vah pratham sultan tha, jisne vijayon tathaa yudhon kii tulana main apni praja kii bhautik unnati ko shreshth sthaan diya, shaasha ke kartavyon kaa vistrut kiya tathaa islam dharm ko rajya shashan kaa aadhaar banaaya
 Henry Elliot and Elphinstone have called Firuz Tughlaq "akbar of the Sultanate era"
 firozshah tululaq kii safaltaaon kaa shrey uske pradhanmantri 'khan-e-jahaan makabool' kaa diya jaataa he
 Sultan Firoz Shah Tughlaq died in September 1388 AD

 web rang ve rang hote hai, jo ki web panne roopankan hetu prayog hote hai
 Web design authors have a lot of options to describe these colors to web components
 inhen bataaya ja saktaa he jaise shaddashamalav roopakar main RGB triplate
 Web colors are colors that are used to design web pages
 web roopankan ke kartaaon ke paas bahut vikalp hote hai, in rangon ko web ghatakon kaa vivaran dene hetu
 These can be described as RGB triplets in a conspiracy form
 ek shaddashamalav triplate hota he ek chah ank, teen bite shaddashamalav sankhya, jo ki HTML main prayukt hoti he rangon ke pradarshan hetu
 The three bytes represent the red, green, blue components of a single color
 ek bite hoti he 00 se FF tak, yaa 0 se 255 
 This represents the least to the most intensity of each of the color components
 The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order: For example, consider the color where the red / green / blue values are decimal numbers: red = 36, green = 104, blue = 160
 The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are 24, 68 and A0 respectively in hexadecimal notation
 To obtain the hex triplet, we simply write the three hex bytes together without spaces, thus: 2468A0
 If a byte is less than 10 or 16 it must be represented with a leading zero to keep the number of digits in the triplet equal to six
 For example, the decimal triplet 0,1,2 would be represented by the hex triplet 000102
 The number of colors that can be represented by this system is An abbreviated, three digit form is sometimes used
 Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC
 This allows each color value to cover its full range from 00 to FF
 Converting a decimal RGB value to a hexadecimal value is fairly straightforward
 Decimal RGB values are usually given in the 0-255 range; if they are in the 0-1 range, multiply the value by 255 before conversion
 This number divided by 16 gives us the first hexadecimal digit 
 The remainder, times 16 again, gives us the second digit
 For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C
 a remainder of 9 gives us the hexadecimal number C9
 This process is repeated for each of the three color values
 Most modern operating systems have a built-in calculator to perform conversions between number bases and this can also be done with some hand-held calculators
 This task can also be carried out using various web resources
 The HTML 4
01 specification defines sixteen named colors, as follows: These 16 were also specified as srgb and included in the HTML 3
0 specification which noted "these colors were originally picked as being the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette
" In addition, a number of colors are defined by web browsers
 a particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005 all modern general-use browsers support the full list
 Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the x Window System
 These colors were standardized by SVG 1
0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents
 They are not part of SVG Tiny
 Almost the exact same color names are used in 
NET Framework, in the knowncolor and Color enumerations
 The only color difference is darkseagreen which is defined as 8F,BC,8B 
 The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below, compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards
 saanchaa:color depthanother set of 216 color values is commonly considered to be the "web-safe" color palette, developed at a time when many computer displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors
 a set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six shades each of red, green, and blue 
 The "web-safe" colors do not all have names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet
 Below are the values for the 6 shades of each color out of 256 possible color shades
 The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors, underlining the really-safe colors
the lack of gamma correction means that the six desired intensities 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% are displayed as 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, and 100% on a Windows standard 2
5 gamma CRT or LCD, making most colors very dark
 The intensities at the low end of the range, especially 0 and 3, are nearly indistinguishable from each other: Note that in the table below, each color code listed is a short-hand for the RGB value; for example, code 609 is equivalent to RGB code 660099
 The Cascading Style Sheets language defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 listed previously
additionally, CSS 2
1 adds the 'orange' color name to the list: CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2
1 also allow web authors to use so-called system colors, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system
 This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent
 As of early 2004, it appears that the CSS3 color module will once again drop these values, marking them deprecated, but this may change
 The developing CSS3 specification will also introduce HSL color space values to style sheets: 2902 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 2902 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he

 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 2902 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he

 On his request, the sages and sages said, "rajan! No childless person can be entitled to go to Brahmaloka, so we are unable to take you with us
" " After listening to the sages and monks, Pandu said to his wife, "O Kunti, it is getting worse for me to be born because a childless person cannot get rid of father-debt, sage-loan, god-loan and man-loan
 Can you help me get a son? " Kunti said, "O Aryaputra! Durvasa Rishi has given me such a mantra by which i can get any thing desired by invoking any god
 aap ajna karen main kis devtaa ko bulaauun
 "at this, Pandu ordered to invite religion

 With a stroke of luck, i have found the system files for the Hindi Wikipedia interface
 i have been luck enough to change the template namespace to template, and now it is the time to choose whether to user Hindu numbers or Devanagari numbers in all automated dates and years etcetera
 i have set up a poll

--woolfavaarta 15:14, 12 april 2007 As Beardkesh ji said, please explain why
 i have explained why i believe we should use roman
 Thank you, and welcome to Wikipedia! - Wolfwort 07:47, 14 April 2007 Hindi is not just language of India it is also used in many other countries hence if Indian gov doesn't uses dev numerals then it doesn't means the we all also stop using dev numerals 
 the place from where i am is lko in UP here i see many ppl using dev numerals even UP education board uses dev numerals 
 my mean is tht we must use Hindi as the way it is not by modifying iti would again say that essence of hindi are related to hindi numerals--sumit sinhavarta Maquahuitl 10:19, 23 April 2007 But i don't think that is the point, what other Wikipedias use
 i think what is most important is what the majority of Hindi writers use
--woolfavaarta 14:17, 23 april 2007 Thanks Manish Vashist - April 24 or April 24 devanagari yaa roman anko kaa prayog!! yah prashn pahane bhi mujhe aayaa tha
 Probably while making the date articles
 tab kuch logo kii raay lee or roman ko devanagari ke upar chunaa
 Mostly Roman numerals are used on this argument
 or tab se lekho par roman anko kaa prayog karata aa rahaa hoon, visheshat: jahaan tarikho kaa prayog hota he
 This has proved to be a little inconvenient for me
 jab bhi anko kaa prayog karnaa hota he to angreji or hindi likhane ke bich adal-badal karnaa hota he
 Now if we make Devanagari digits standard, then wherever Roman numbers are used, it has to be changed
 dono hi mushkil he
 It seems less difficult to continue using Roman numerals
 so, meraa mat roman anko ko maanak banaae rakhane me he
 Devnagari numerals or Roman !! seemed an old question to me
 Probably, when i had to create date articles
 Consulted few people and choose roman over devnagari, because it was more widely used
 Since then i have been using roman numerals, specially for dates
 It has been little inconvenient for me
 Whenever i have to use numerals, i have to switch between hindi-english typing
 Now, if we favor devnagari over roman, we had to change wherever we used roman
 Both are difficult
 It seems to be less difficult to carry on using roman numerals
 So, i think we should keep using roman numerals 
-- Mitul 21:31, 27 April 2007 mujhe lagata he ki devanagari sankhyaon kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 As Yan says, English numbers are only fond today and we can change what we have written very easily
 or yah bhi he ki likhte samay hindi or angrezi keyboard ke bich adal-badal karata rahanaa mushkil he
 Bernar 13:43, 30 April 2007 And why do we always judge popularity by the big cities
 In small cities / towns and villages, the literate people still use Devanagari numerals
maquahuitl 21:02, 3 may 2007 Finally, i have found an "official" article about this: http: / / rajbhasha
nic
in / consthin
htm in Hindi or http: / / rajbhasha
nic
in / consteng
htm in English
 Here is the extract in English: The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devnagari script
 The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union shall be the international form of Indian numerals
 Notwithstanding anything in clause, for a period of fifteen years from the commencement of this Constitution, the English language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement: Provided that the President may, during the said period, by order authorise the use of the Hindi language in addition to the English language and of the Devnagari form of numerals in addition to the internationl form of Indian numerals for any of the official purposes of the Union
 Notwithstanding anything in this article, Parliament may be law provided for the use, after the said period of fifteen years, of- the English language, or the Devnagari form of numerals, for such purposes as may be specified in the law
 and in Hindi: Article 343
 Official language of the Union- sangh kii rajbhasha hindi or lipi devanagari hogi, sangh ke shaskeey prayojanon ke liye prayog hone vaale ankon kaa rup bhartiya ankon kaa antarrashtriya rup hoga
 Notwithstanding anything in the clause, the English language will continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for the period of fifteen years from the commencement of this Constitution for which it was being used immediately before such commencement: parantu raashtrapati ukt avadhi ke dauraan, aadesh dwaara, sangh ke shaskeey prayojanon main se kisi ke liye angreji bhashaa ke atirikt hindi bhashaa kaa or bhartiya ankon ke antarrashtriya rup ke atirikt devanagari rup kaa prayog praadhikrut kar sakegaa
 Notwithstanding anything in this article, Parliament shall, by law, after the said fifteen-year term angreji bhashaa kaa, yaa Devanagari form of numerals, aise prayojanon ke liye prayog upbandhit kar sakegi jo aisi vidhi main vinirdisht kiye jaaen
 Please give your comments 
-- Wolfavart 15:32, 8 May 2007 i have completely changed my mind now
 Dadhikeshji's idea is great, or, since i have been doing a bit of research in both books and on the Internet, i think the usage of Devanagari numerals is good
 Devanagari numerals are used in more formal and important content; and what is more formal and important than an encyclopedia? aapkaa vichaar kya he?--woolfavaarta 16:30, 10 may 2007 Hello everyone, vigat teen-chaar maheenon ke anubhav ke baad mai rohit ji kii baat se puri tarah se sahamat hum ki mukhaprishth par jo samachar lag rahe hai, vah hindi vikipedia ti raftaar se mail nahin khate
 All the managers are doing a great job for the Hindi Wikipedia, for which they have a piety 


 but i think they should have a separate cell of two to four people to be given the freedom to update the news
 isse samaacharon ke madhyam se bhi logon ko hindi vikipedia par aakarshith kiya ja sakegaa
 Apart from this, the other thing which i am feeling with pride while updating the site of the countries is the use of Hindi in numbers
 mere khyaal se ham hindi vikipedia par angreji kii sankhyaon kaa upyog karen, to un logon ke liye bahut upyogi hoga, jo in lekhon ko shodh ke liye kapi-paste kar upyog karte hai
 It is very important to create a standard about numericals, in which i support English numericals

 anunaad singh 12:09, 20 june 2009 Is there a template that changes 0-9 to o-9, and / or vice versa? -- alok 10:54, 15 sitambar 2009 Hello everyone, i want to bring to your notice that in Hindi Wikipedia and its pages, we or the system itself uses Hindi marks
 Today, where Hindi is fighting for its existence, not all the states of India use it, most of the documents are in English and English is the only language of the Internet, should we use Hindi marks? kuch samay pehle maine ek prasiddh kavi ke saakshaatkaar main unke vichaar pade kii hindi jo itani lokapriy nahin he voh he apane kathin shabdaawalee or hindi ke alag anko kii vajah se
 bank kaa hi udahaaran le, paise jamaa karne vaale slip par "hastarankarta kaa naam" likhaa hota hai, kya "jamaa karne vaale kaa naam" nahin likh sakate
 yah roj marara ke shabd he or inhen samajane ke liye hindi kaa vishesh gyaan hona aavashyak nahin
 Almost every Indian who is Hindi speaking and who uses Hindi Wikipedia, has to learn Hindi, and if he is watching on the Hindi Wikipedia computer, then he has an early knowledge of English
 Everyone cannot understand Hindi numbers / numbers, we are taught Hindi in schools and Hindi marks are not given in any English medium school
 aakhir main meraa anurodh he ke kya yah sahi hoga kii ham sarv sahmati se english ke hi anko kaa upyog kare
 aap ke sujav va vichaaron kii pratiksha main! --siddharth goud 17:30, 3 november 2009 At the end, understand one thing more carefully - there is a difference between the 'signatory's name' and 'depositor's name'

 koi bhi prasiddh hindi kavi apane saakshaatkaar main yah nahin kah saktaa ki hindi lokapriy nahin he yaa uski shabdaawalee kathin he yaa hindi ke 9 ankon ko siikhaa yaa samajha nahin ja saktaa

 As far as Charu ji said, you will see that you will feel compelled to vote again, no, i did not know that all your old users have already voted about this
 i respect your decision
 Hopefully everyone will continue to support you

 The Han Dynasty was a dynasty of ancient China that ruled China from 206 BCE to 220 AD
 haan rajvansh apane se pehle aane vaale chin rajvansh ko satta se bedagal karke china ke singhaasana par virajman hua or uske shasankaal ke baad teen rajshahiyon kaa daur aayaa
 The foundation of the Han dynasty was kept by a rebel leader named Liu Bang, who after his death was formally renamed Emperor Gaozu
 haan kaal ke bich main, 9 isvi se 23 isvi tak, sheen rajvansh ne satta hathiyaa lee thi, lekin uske baad haan vansh phir se satta pakadaney main safal rahaa
 The Han period before the Sheen Dynasty is called the Western Han Dynasty and the later Han period is called the Eastern Han Dynasty

 In the eastern Eurasian steppe north of the Han Empire, there was a nomadic race called Shionganu who periodically attacked Han territories
 200 isapurv main unke netaa modu chanyu ne haan sena ko maat de di
 The Han Empire was forced to compromise them in which in 198 BC, a Han Chinese princess became a bride and married a Shionganu chieftain

 He said, 'does a child ever attack his maternal grandfather?' But this did not happen and the scuffle continued despite the marriages in which the Han Chinese had the upper hand and sometimes the Shionganu people

 bhartiya darshan ke sandarbh main, pratyaksh, teen pramukh pramaanon main se ek he
 This proof is considered to be the best
 'pratyaksh' kaa shabdic arth he- vah vastu jo aankhon ke saamne ho
 Here 'eye' refers to all the senses
 pratyaksh kaa arth prati+aksh hota he
 Prati means 'in front' and axis means 'eye', ie direct means 'in front of the eye'
 yaha aksh kaa arth sankuchit na lete hue vyapak arth paanch indriya ke saamne arthath pach indriyon ke samaksh hone vaale gyaan ko pratyaksh gyaan kehete hai
 It is a means of acquiring knowledge
 nyaay darshan ke anusaar pratyaksh kaa arth indriarthsannikarshajnya gyanam pratyakshm yah he
 Direct knowledge has its origin in this way
 inamen se aatma, man or indriya kaa sanyog rup jo gyaan kaa karan yaa pramaan he vahi pratyaksh he
 Being aware of the senses of coincidence with the object is known as 'direct'
 gautam ne nyayasutra main kaha he ki indriya ke dwaara kisi padaarth kaa jo gyaan hota he, vahi pratyaksh he
 For example, if we see burning in front of us or if we experience its temperature, then this is a clear proof that 'the fire is burning'
 is gyaan main padaarth or indriya kaa pratyaksh sambandh hona chahie
 If someone says that 'that book is old' then it is not a direct proof; Because the knowledge it contains is only through words, not by matter, so it will go under word-proof
 par yadi vahi kitaab hamaare saamne aa jaay or maili kuchaili yaa fatty hui dikhaai de to hamen is baat kaa avashya pratyaksh gyaan ho jaayga ki 'yah kitaab puraani he'
 Direct knowledge is not through the words of someone, hence it is called 'non-textual'
 pratyaksh ko avyabhichaari isaliye kehete hai ki uske dwaara jo vastu jaisi hoti he uskaa vaisaa hi gyaan hota he
 Some Naiyayiks consider this knowledge to be the only proof
 unke mat se 'pratyaksh pramaan' indriya he, indriya se utpann gyaan 'pratyaksh gyaan' he
 But the intention of the sutrakara from the post of non-text is clear that the unbiased knowledge of the object is the only direct evidence
 naveen granthkaar donon maton ko milakar kehete hai ki pratyaksh gyaan ke karan teen hai- In the first stage, when there is only sense, then the result of that will be the direct knowledge that comes before the first manifestation of a substance
 jaise, vah saamne koi cheez dikhaai detii he
 This knowledge is called 'alternative knowledge'
 duusari avasthaa main yah jaan padataa he ki jo cheez saamne he, vah pustak he
 This 'alternative knowledge' happened
 is gyaan kaa kaaran indriya kaa sambandh he
 When knowledge arises from the relation of the senses, then the knowledge that this book is good or bad is direct knowledge
 pratyaksh gyaan 6 prakaar kaa hota he - Queensland is a state in Australia
 isaki rajdhani brisben nagar he
 That condition of the body of a human or any other animal is called Putibhavan or vigor in which the body starts destroying its own tissues or organs
 spasht he ki yah ek jaanaleva sthiti he

 james web antariksh doordarshee ) ek prakaar kii avarakt antariksh vedhashala he
 It is the scientific successor of the Hubble Space Telescope and the modern-day visionary, which will be launched in June 2014 from the Ariane 5 rocket
 iskaa mukhya kaary brahmand ke un sudur nikaayon kaa avlokan karnaa he jo prithvi par sthit vedhashalaon or habal doordarshee ke pahunch ke baahar he
 JWST is a project of NASA and the United States Space Agency with international support from the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency, and fifteen other countries
 iskaa asli naam agali peedi kaa antariksh doordarshee ) tha, jiskaa san 2002 main nasa ke dwitiya prashaasak james edwin web ke naam par dobaaraa namakaran kiya gaya
 James Edwin Webb led NASA from Kennedy to the Johnson administration period
 unki dekharekh main nasa ne kai mahatvapurn prakshepan kiye, jisame gemini kaarykram ke antargat budh ke saare prakshepan evam pratham maanav yukt apollo udaan shaamil he
 The orbit of JWST will be at the point L2 about fifteen million kilometers beyond the Earth, that is, the position of the Earth will always remain between the Sun and L2 point
 chunki L2 bindu main sthit vasteen hamensha prithvi kii aad main surya kii parikrama karti he isliye JWST ko keval ek vikiran kavach kii zarurat hogi jo doordarshee or prithvi ke bich lagi hogi
 This radiation shield will protect the telescope from heat and light coming from the sun and some amount of infrared radiation from the earth
 L2 bindu ke aasapaas sthit JWST kii kaksha kii trigya bahut adhik he, jis kaaran prithvi ke kisi bhi hisse kii chaaya is par nahin padegi
 Despite being much closer to the Earth than the Sun, there will be no eclipse on JWST
 JWST praathmik vaigyanik mishan ke mukhya chaar ghatak he
 First, to discover the first galaxy in the universe after the big-bang and the first star to be formed
 doosraa, akashgangaon kaa gathan or unke vikaas kaa adhyayan karnaa
 Third, understanding the formation of stars and planetary systems; and fourth, studying the origin of life and planetary systems
 in sabhi kaaryon kaa vishleshan drishy prakaash kii apeksha avarakt prakaash main adhik prabhavi dhang se kiya ja saktaa he
 This is why the equipment of the JWST, like the Hubble telescope, will not be visible or ultraviolet, but will have the ability to collect large amounts of infrared light

 For some reason this observatory will not be launched before June 2014 and as per the current schedule, this telescope with a mass of about 6
2 tons is placed in orbit with the help of the launch vehicle 'ariane 5' from 'guyana Space Center' Kuru, French Guiana
 This observatory will be handed over to the scientific mission for at least the next five years, about 6 months after it is established
 It is being prepared that according to the possibilities of expansion of scientific mission, its scheduled tenure will be extended by increasing its existing capabilities
 JWST kii kaksha andakaar hogi or isaki trigya ardh-sthaayee dwitiya lagranj bindu L2 ke aasapaas aath lakh kilometre hogi
 Earth - The distance from the earth to the Sun L2 point is fifteen million kilometers
 yah duuri prithvi or chandramaa ke bich ki duuri se chaar guna adhik he
 Being located at such a long distance, the service of web telescope after launch would be a much more difficult task than the Hubble telescope
 iske chintan kii philhal koi yojana nahin he
 The objects which lie outside the orbit of the Earth generally take more than a year to make one round of the Sun
 haalanki L2 bindu par gurutvkarshneey khinchaav santulit hota he
 This means that JWST and Earth will orbit the Sun simultaneously
 surya or prithvi kaa sanyukt gurutvkarshan bal antariksh yaan ko is bindu par tham kar rakhega
 Theoretically the spacecraft would not need any extra bumps to orbit through L2, it would automatically orbit the Earth as well as the Sun
 JWST habal antariksh doordarshee kaa sachcha uttaradhikari is myne main he ki yah apekshaakrit adhik se adhik taron ko dekhne main sakasham he
 For comparison, Hubble takes two images of Carina Niharika taken from a space telescope
 donon ek hi khagoleey nikaay ke chitra he
 The upper image is taken in visible light while the lower image is taken in infrared light
 donon chitron ko dhyaan se dekhne par spasht he ki avarakt prakaash main liye gaye chitra main adhik taron ko dekha ja saktaa he jabaki usee sthaan kii drishy prakaash main liye gaye chitra main apekshaakrit kam taare najar aate hai
 The visual spectrum cannot be seen properly across gas and dust, making the images blurry while the infrared spectrum can be seen easily
 lagbhag sabhi prakaar kii gaisen or dhul drishy prakaash main lee gai chhaviyon ko dhundhala kar drishy ko purna rup se gaayab kar detii he
 In contrast, infrared light gives a clear image of stars behind gas and dust
 avarakt khagoliki, antariksh ke dhoosar kshetron ko bhed sakati he, grahon kaa pataa laga sakati he or yahan tak ki brahmand ke shuruuaati dinon kii ucch laal-vichlan vastuon ko bhi dekh sakati he
 Most of the stars located far away from the stars near us are renewed or young and they were born very close to the bigbang in due course of time
 chunki brahmand fail rahaa he isliye in naveekrut taron se ham tak pahunchne vaala prakaash, varnakram main laal-vichlan pradarshit karata he or yahi kaaran he ki inhen avarakt prakaash main aasaani se dekha ja saktaa he
 Infrared light is also used to observe the core of active galaxies, which are often covered with gas and dust
 niyar infrared spectrograph web doorabeen ke chaar upkarnon main se ek he
 It is a multi-object spectrograph capable of observing more than 100 astronomical objects simultaneously

 The Near Infrared Spectrograph is produced by European industry to ESA specifications and is managed by the ESA JWST project at ESTEC, The Netherlands

 The device will provide direct images and coronagraphic photographs of medium- and low-resolution spectroscopy
 iske dwaara web doorabeen ke sabhi praathmik vigyaan uddeshyon main mahatvapurn yogadan kii ummid he
 The Mid Infrared instrument was developed as a partnership between Europe and the United States - the main partners being the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, ESA and nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, a consortium of the nationally funded European Institute
 web doorabeen kaa mukhya darpan berilium dhaatu par sone kii coating kar banaaya gaya he
 It is a mirror consisting of 18 segments of hexagon shape arranged in two rings around a center
 prayek khand kaa vyas 1
3 meter or vajan lagbhag 20 kilo he
 One of the science goals of James Webb telescope is to look back at the time stream when the galaxies were in their youth
 web yah kaary sudur kii un akashgangaon ke nirikshan se karegaa jo hamase 13 arab prakashavarsh dur he
 To see such lifeless objects located far away, the web will need a big mirror
 darpan kaa kshetrafal jitna adhik hoga vah utana hi adhik prakaash ikattha kar sakegaa or nirikshit vastu utani hi adhik baariki se dekhi ja sakegi
 If the size of the 2
4-meter mirror of the Hubble telescope is adapted to the needs of the web, it would be a challenging task in itself to build such a large and weighing mirror and install it in space
 isse pehle antariksh main itnaa bada darpan kabhi nahin le jaaya gaya he
 The web team found a new way to solve this problem
 unhone ek aisa darpan banane kaa nishchay kiya jo vajan main halkaa ho or bahut majboot bhi ho
 Eventually they decided to make the mirror with beryllium metal
 berilium ek halki dhaatu he or yah apane vajan ke hisaab se bahut majboot hoti he
 It has many properties that satisfy the requirements of the main mirror of the web
 berilium vibhinn taapamanon main bhi apane aakaar ko sthir banaaen rakhane main sakasham he
 In addition, it is a good conductor of electricity and heat and does not have magnetic properties
 itane bade darpan ko prakshepan yaan ke andar rakhana bhi apane aap main ek samasya he
 Such a large mirror cannot fit in the vehicle and optics does not allow it to shrink its size
 To solve this problem, the web team decided to make the mirror in many such sections which can be folded and reduced in size so that it can easily fit into the vehicle
 After the web telescope is placed in its orbit, the mirror will be opened so that it will regain its former shape
