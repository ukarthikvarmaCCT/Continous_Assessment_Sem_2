 'hi, Karna, why were you born? Why was he born heroic? kavach or kundal-bhooshit bhi tera adham sharir hua?

 As a vigorous journalist, Mishra ji edited 'shri Sharda' monthly in 1921, 'dainik Lokmat' in 1931 and weekly 'sarathi' in 1947
 lala lajpat raay kii angrejon kii lathi se hui maut par 'lokmat' main likhe unke sampadakeey par pan motilal nehru ne kaha tha ki bharat kaa sarvshereshth faujadaari vakil bhi isse acha abhiyog patr taiyaar nahin kar saktaa

 udayan chandravansh ke raja or sahasranik ke putr the
 Vrati of Vatsa, whose capital was Kaushambi
 kaushambi elahabaad jile main nagar se praaia: 50 kimi pashchim me basii thi, jahaan aaj bhi yamuna ke tir kosam gaanv main unke khandhar hai
 Udayans have become great pranks in the tradition of Sanskrit literature and they have more fame in that literature than Don Juan, the beloved hero of Spanish literature
 baar-baar sanskrit ke kaviyon, natyakaro or kathakaron ne unhe apni rachanaaon kaa nayak banaaya he or unki lokapriyata ke parinamswaroop gaanvon main log ninratar unki katha pracheen kaal main kehete rahe hai
 Mahakavi Bhasa has made him the hero of his narrative in his two plays - Swapnavasavadatta and Pratyagayogandharayana
 vatsaraj kii katha brihatkatha or somdev ke kathasaritsagar main bhi varnit he
 It is evident from these works that Udayan was highly skilled in veenaavadana and due to his addiction he had to pay the prison of Avantiraj Chandapradyot Mahasen at Ujjayini
 bhaas ke naatak ke anusaar veena bajaakar hathi pakadte samay chhadamgaj dwaara avantiraj ne unhen pakad liya tha
 Later, along with Udayan Pradyot's daughter Vasvadatta, Vatsa ran away on the elephant

 Vatsaraja Udayan was undoubtedly a historical figure and in addition to literature and art, he is also mentioned in Puranas and Buddhist texts

 The eponymous plaque of Kaushamb has just been found in the excavation of Kaushambas from Punit Annayaram, the residence of the Buddha of Kaushambi mentioned in Buddhist texts
 udayan ne magadh ke raja darshak kii bhagini padmavati or ang ke raja drudhverma kii kanya ko bhi, vaasavadatta ke atirikt, sambhavat: byaaha tha
 In the four dynasties of the Buddha period, Magadha, Kosala, Vats, Avanti, there was also a long-term conflict between them, Udayan vats were also there, which eventually got entrenched in the increasing boundaries of Avanti
 idhar haal main jo pracheen ke prati bharat kaa punarjagran hua he uske parinamswaroop udayan ko nayak banaakar kii praaia: sabhi bhashaaon main naatak or kahaniyaan likhi gai hai
 It shows that the literary glory of Vatsaraja has not decreased and he is still popular among literary writers today
 modular ganit purnaakon ke ganit kii ek pranali he jisamen kisi purnank par pahunchne ke baad ginati 1 se shuru ho jaati he
 It is sometimes called clockwise mathematics
 is kshetra main swiss ganitagya islar ne bahut ullekhneey kaary kiya
 After this, Carl Friedrich Gauss extended it further
 modulo ganit kaa ek chota sa upyog ghadiyaan ke samay main hota he
 It is 8 o'clock in the morning; 7 hours from now, it should be 8 + 7 = 15, which we call 3
 
 That is, both 15 and 3 are the same for Modulo 12
 do purna sankhyaon a or b ko mapank n ke prati samshesh kehete hai, jab n se a - b vibhajya he
 It is written as follows: n ko samsheshtha kaa mapank kehete hai
 for example kyonki 38 − 14 = 24, jo 12 kaa gunaj he
 The same rule for negative integers is- samsheshtha ke gundharm samikarnon ke gundharmon ke samaan hai
 If a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} b and c ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} d, then a + c ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} b + d and ac ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} bd
 yadi x kaa ek bahupadiy falan f hai, jisen x ke gunak purnank hai or a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } b, to f ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } f, parantu yadi ab ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } ac, to yah aavashyak nahin he ki b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } c, udaahranarth 1 ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } 6, parantu 1 or 3 samshesh nahin hai ke prati
 The only fruit that can be deduced from ab ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} ac is that one of the great advantages of this notation method of equilibrium is that it beautifully delineates the many fruits of number theory
 can go
 sampurna or laghukrit avasheshon kaa samucchy - samsheshtha sambandh tulyata sambandh he
 This means that the following relationship is true: a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } a ; a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} b means b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} a
 a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } b, b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } c kaa arth a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } c he
 Therefore, the equilibrium relationship divides the set of integers into squares of incompleteness such that every two integer measure of a square is contiguous to m and the two integer measure of different fractions is not balanced to m
 yadi m virgon main se prayek varg se ek ek purnank liya jaae, to mapank m ke prati sampurna avasheshon kaa ek ek samucchy praapt hoga
 Thus -3, 3, 2, 12, 14, 20, -6 is a set of complete residues per modulus 7
 mapank m ke prati saralatam avasheshi kaa samucchy 0, 1, 2, 3


 m-1 he or nirpeksh laghutam sampurna avasheshon kaa amucchy nimnaankit he : 0, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} 1, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} 2, xxrep 6 
 ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} / 2, when m is odd tathaa 0, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } 1, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } 2, xxrep 4 
 ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } / 2, jab m sam he Similarly, if a set of prime integers is taken against m, they can be divided into such squares of f equivalence that every 2 numbers in a given square will be equal to the modulus m and any 2 numbers of the different fractions to the modulus m

 Annual rainfall - mm jiladhikari - In the Brahmi script and most of the scripts derived from it, the group of fifth characters of each category of the alphabet is called Panchamaksharas or Panchamaksharas
 devanagari main ng, na, na, na tathaa m panchamakshar hai
 Panchamakshars are used in various languages
 sabhi bhashaaon main paychamaksharon ke prayog ke apane-apane niyam yaa paripati he
 In order to remove the problems of technical typing machines in Hindi, an immediate solution was suggested to use Panchmakshar in place of Panchamakshar instead of Panchamakshar, due to which, in contemporary Hindi writing, Panchmakshar has been given preference over Panchamakshar
 saamanyatya anuswaar kii dhvanyaatmakataa ko spasht karne ke liye pancham varna - 'kavarg', 'chavarg', 'tavarg', 'tavarg' evam 'pavarg' ke ji, ji, n, n evam m- kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 Such as Ganga - Ganga, Pancham - Pancham, Kantha - Kantha, Kandha - Kandha, Vibration - Vibration etc
 jahaan tak hindi kaa sambandh he, tankan yantron par devanagari ke upyog ko sugam banane ke liye kuch sthitiyon main panchamaaksharon ke sthaan par anuswaar likhakar kaam nikaalane kaa suzav diya gaya tha
 But it is not the case that the use of Panchamaksharas was forbidden, or the use of Anusvara in place of Panchamaksharas was declared more pure
 kuch sthitiyon main subhita ke liye panchamaaksharon ke sthaan par anuswaar ke prayog se sambandhit kuch suzav diye gayi the ve nimnlikhit hai
 It is possible to change their usage in the perspective of different sections of the alphabet
 jaise- In class, प्रयोग is used before a, b, c, d
 haalanki 'paranmukh' or 'vaanmay' aadi kuch shabdon main apwaad swaroop 'ji' kaa hi prayog miltaa he

 Accordingly, except for specific phonetic experiments, anuspicious can be used for this class

 Such as Anchal, Panchhi, Anjan and Janghat etc
 haalanki na kaa prayog hindi lekhan main praayah nahin ho rahaa he
 Anusarav is now being used instead of them
 ji bhi shabd ke aadi yaa ant main nahin aata
 In class, the word is used before t, t, d, dh
 jaise- ghanta, kanth, anda aadi
 Now the reminder is often used in their place

 For example, contact, cave, amber, etc

 Such as: contact, secret, amber and grave
 hindi shabdanushasan kii rachana karne vaale kishori das vaajapeyi kaa maananaa he ki panchamakshar anunasik alpapraan hai
 According to him, there is no addition of '6', 'J' and 'N' in the form of Hindi
 jo mithaas 'na' tathaa 'm' main he, vah in teenon main nahin he
 That is why Hindi has adopted 'N' and 'M' only
 sanskrit shabd jo hindi main prayukt hote hai, un main hi ye aate hai - 'vaanmay', 'chaanchalya', 'panditya' aadi
 Vajpayee ji believes that the place of Anusvara is also nasal
 sanskrit vyakaran ke anusaar 'm' praayah or 'n' kabhi-kabhi anuswaar hua karata he
 This is the reason that even the sound of the consonants starts giving sweet sound - 'kankan kinkini nupur dhani suni'
 jaisaa 'na' vaisaa hi anuswaar madhur

 In algebra, fractional fraction diffusion is a method used to reduce the degree of a fraction or denominator of a rational fraction
 sankethik rup main, nimnlikhit parimey bhinn ko aanshik bhinnon main todaa ja saktaa he- Where ƒ and g are polynomials
 iske aanshik bhinn nimnavat honge- Where gj is polynomial and these are the factors of g
 mana diya hua bhinn r = p q { \ displaystyle R={ \ frac {P}{Q}}} he to: When the denominator of a given fraction can be linear factors such as x - a { \ displaystyle xa}; Where n> = 1 r = p n = a 1 + a 2 2 + 
 
 
 + a n n { \ displaystyle R={ \ frac {p}{^{n}}}={ \ frac {A1}{}}+{ \ frac {A2}{^{2}}}+


+{ \ frac {an}{^{n xxrep 4 } When the denominator of a given fraction is not a linear factor but has quadratic factors such as 2 + b 2 { \ displaystyle ^ {2} + b ^ {2}}: r = p n = a 1 + a 2 2 + 
 
 
 + a n n { \ displaystyle R={ \ frac {p}{^{n}}}={ \ frac {A1}{}}+{ \ frac {A2}{^{2}}}+


+{ \ frac {an}{^{n xxrep 4 } Here, the denominator splits into two distinct linear factors: so we have the partial fraction decomposition Multiplying through by x2 + 2x - 3, we have the polynomial identity Substituting x = −3 into this equation gives a = −1 / 4, and substituting x = 1 gives b = 1 / 4, so that After long-division, we have Since 2 − 4×8 = −16 1 and it is just p if m=1
)thus, for instance the first derivative at x=1 gives that is 8 = 4B + 8 so b = 0
 Thus, f can be decomposed into rational functions whose denominators are z+1, z−1, z+i, z−i
 Since each term is of power one, −1, 1, −i and i are simple poles
 Hence, the residues associated with each pole, given by are respectively, and Limits can be used to find a partial fraction decomposition
 First, factor the denominator: The decomposition takes the form of As x → 1 { \ displaystyle x \ to 1}, the a term dominates, so the right-hand side approaches a x - 1 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {A} {x-1}}}
 Thus, we have As x → ∞ { \ displaystyle x \ to \ infty }, the right-hand side is Thus, b = - 1 3 { \ displaystyle b = - { \ frac {1} {3}}}
 At x = 0 { \ displaystyle x=0}, − 1 = − a + c { \ displaystyle -1=-A+C} 
 Therefore, c = − 2 3 { \ displaystyle C=-{ \ frac {2}{3}}} 
 The decomposition is thus 1 3 x - 1 + - 1 3 x - 2 3 x 2 + x + 1 { \ displaystyle { \ frac { \ frac {1} {3}} {x-1}} + { \ frac { - { \ frac {1} {3}} x - { \ frac {2} {3}}} {x ^ {2} + x + 1}}}

 Older designs of small two-stroke engines generate more pollution than four-stroke engines
 haalanki, aadhunik do stroke dizin, jaise wespa ET2 injection eendhan injection kaa upyog karata he or yah chaar stroke ke samaan saaf hota he
 Diesel's larger two-stroke engines, which are used in ships and rail engines, have always used fuel-injection and produced less emissions

 In theory, a four-stroke engine should be larger than a two-stroke engine to produce an equal amount of energy
 Two-stroke engines are used these days in developed countries, mainly because of the manufacturer's reluctance to invest in reducing two-stroke emissions
 Traditionally, two-stroke engines required more maintenance,
 Although the simplest two-stroke engine has fewer moving parts, they can deteriorate faster than a four-stroke engine

 Air Canon uses two special types of pistons: a close tolerance piston and a double piston
 In close tolerance pistons, the O-ring is used as a valve but in double pistons, the O-ring is not used
 chlose tolerance piston kii kuch visheshtaayen neeche di gai hai: Common features of double piston: chunki piston ek ingine main pashchaagr kaa mukhya hissaa he, isaki gatishiltaa ek asantulan paidaa karti he
 This imbalance usually manifests itself in a vibration, which manifests as the engine hardens

 The sound produced by backlash engines can be unbearable and, as a result, many backlash engines rely on heavy noise suppression devices to reduce the noise and high noise
 piston kii urja ko crank main sanchaarit karne ke liye, piston ek connecting rod se juda hota he jo aage crank se judaa hota he
 Because the linear movement of the piston needs to be converted to a cyclic movement of the crank, resulting in mechanical losses

 The conductivity of the crank shaft is not smooth, because the energy supplied by the piston is not constant and is impulsive in nature

 This conversation is also known as 'pravink-vidya'
 garg rishi ke praputra, maharishi chitra, yajna karne kaa nishchay karke arun ke putr mahatma uddalak ko pradhan ruthvik ke rup main aamantrit karte hai, parantu muni uddalak swayan na jaakar apane putr shwethaketu ko yajna sampann karaane ke liye bhej dete hai
 Shwetketu arrives at the behest of his father and sits on a high seat
 tab chitra usase prashn karata he-'he gautamakumar! is lok main koi aisa aavarnayukt sthaan he, jahaan tum mujhe le jaakar rakh sakate ho yaa phir usamen bhi koi aisa sarvatha pruthak or vilakshan aavaran se shunya pad he, jisko jaanakar tum usee lok main mujhe pratishthit kar sakate ho?' Saying this, Shwetketu left the posture of sacrifice and asked his father - 'oh Father! How should i answer the question that Maharishi Chitra has asked me? Shwetketu repeated the question of the picture to his father
 tab uddalak rishi ne kaha-'putr! main bhi iskaa uttar nahin jaanata
 Both of us will achieve this learning only by walking into the Yajshala of Maharishi Chitra and studying it
 'tadnantar donon pita-putr prasiddh aaruni muni ke haath se samidha grahan karke jigyaasu-bhav se maharishi chitra ke paas gayi or kaha ki ve vidya-prapti hetu unke paas aaye hai
 The picture said- 'O Gautam! You are highly revered among Brahmins and possess theology; Because coming to me, you do not have even a little pride of your superiority
 main nishchay hi aapako iskaa bodh karaungaa
 Maharishi Chitra said- 'O Vipraver! The person who is going to perform the rituals of Agnihotri, they all go from this world towards Chandralok, that is, heaven, but the person who is enamored of heavenly happiness accepts Chandralok, all his virtues are destroyed and he again : Falls back to this earth, that is, he is reborn again
 use moksh nahin mil paata
 On the saying of Maharishi Chitra, Gautam Muni again asked - "O God! Tell me who i am Tell me the way to cross this Bhavsagar, so that i can be free from all the buildings
 ' maharishi chitra ne kaha-'he gautam! devyan maarg se jane vaala sadhak kramash: agnilok, vayulok, suryalok, varunalok, indralok va prajapatilok aadi chah lokon main se hota hua 'brahmalok' main pravesh kar paata he
 There is a large reservoir named 'ar' at the entrance of 'brahmaloka'

 Here, even a moment's ego and bondage of work, anger, greed etc
 destroy all the virtues of the seeker

 Apsaras named Vishwa Janani Amba and Ambavayvi are engaged in their service, who welcome the Brahmavetta seeker and ornate him and present him to Brahma Ji
 'is upanishad main ek atyant sundar roopak baandhakar devyan maarg se brahmalok tak pahunchane kaa maarg dikhaaya gaya he
 It is here that the sage says that the man traveling in the chariot sees the wheels of the chariot running, but he does not see the coincidence of the speed of the wheels from the ground
 isi prakaar brahmalok kii yatra karne vaala sadhak rath par baithkar din or raat ko to dekhtaa he, kaal kii gati ko bhi dekhtaa he, paap-punya ko bhi dekhtaa he, parantu vah unamem lipt nahin hota
 He attains 'brahma' only by staying away from them
 kaam, krodh, lobh, moh or ahankaar uske maarg ke baadhak nahin banataa
 Maharishi's picture further says - 'O Gautam! The seeker becomes a Brahmavetta and experiences Brahmagandha, Brahmaras, Brahmatej, Brahmayash and Brahmnad in all his senses
 tab brahma ji us brahmagyani se prashn karte hai-'tum koun ho?' us samay brahma ji dwaara puche gayi prashnon kaa uttar brahmagyani ko is prakaar dena chahie— In this way, after answering all the questions of Brahma Ji, Lord Brahma himself says to the seeker that the famous 'five great' waters are my place

 Sage Gautama, along with his son Shvetketu, returned after bowing to the Maharishi picture
 is adhyay main 'prantatva' kii upasna or 'brahmavidya' ke vyaavhaarik paksh par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 In addition to this, 'suryopasana' to destroy his sins, for the son's skillful desire and safety, 'chandropasana', 'for good health', Somopasana, 'for salvation,' Pramanapasana 'and the son for his whole life While giving the burden of responsibility, 'sampradan Karma' has described very clearly
 prantatva kii upasnis adhyay main 'praan' ko hi 'brahm' kaa rup mana he
 Pran is conceived as a king
 'man' uskaa doot he, 'vaani' uski rani he, 'chakshu' uski suraksha karne vaale mantri hai, 'karnendriya' sandesh grahan karne vaale dwarpal hai
 As soon as the soul arrives, the service of all senses is automatically received by the king of life
 suprasiddh mahatma shushkabhingaar 'praan' ko hi brahm kaa rup sweekaar karte hai
 Therefore, the worship of life is going to give favored attainments
 jivan main shreshthata, sukh-samruddhi, yash, tejaswita tathaa gyaan pranopasna dwaara ho saktaa he
 Suryopasanakoshitki, through his experience, has said to perform Suryopasana thrice - morning, midday and evening
 unhone kaha he ki praat:kaal yagyopavit ko savy bhav se baayen kandhe par rakhkar aachman karen
 Then fill the water vessel thrice with pure water, offer arghya to the rising sun and chant this mantra - 'vardoshi in Vrgosi papamanam
 ' is prakaar madhyahnkaal main, bhagwaan bhaskar ko samaran karen or is mantra kaa uccharan karen-' udvargosi papmanan main sanvruddhi
 Similarly, in the evening, worship the sun while setting and chant this mantra - 'ॐ Vriddhogऽsī Papamanam
 ' is prakaar suryopasna karne se manushya ke din-raat ke saare paapon kaa shaman ho jaataa he, paap karm na karne kii shakti utpann ho jaati he
 In Chandropasana Avamasya, when the sun is located in the western part and the moon is situated in the moon named Sushumna, then by this method one should perform Chandropasana
 arghya dene vaale paatr main do hari durva ke ankur bhi avashya rakh len
 Then chanting this mantra while offering Arghya - 'yatte Susimam Hridayamadhi Chandramamsishritam Tenamritattasyeshane Mahan Potramyadam Rudam
 ' is prakaar kii prarthana se upaask putr shok se bachaa rahata he tathaa putr na hone kii sthiti main putr-ratna praapt kar letaa he
 Somopasana Rishi has considered Somopasana to be the reason for a healthy body
 vah som se prarthana karata he-'he stri-rupi som! tum purush-rupi surya ke prakaash se vikaas ko praapt ho
 Be helpful in getting food from all sides
 he som! tum saumy gunon se yukt ho
 By attaining the glory of the Sun, your divine juice becomes very beneficial for men
 tum is divya ras kaa seven karne vaale purushon ko pushti do or unke sabhi shatruon kaa paraabhav karaane main puri tarah se sahaayak bano
 Hey Mon! You can help in the attainment of immortality while achieving happiness with fiery glory and set your fame in heaven
 he som! main tumhaari hi gati kaa anugaman karte hue apni dahini bhujaa ko baar-baar ghumata hum
 'the sage calls Soma the five-faced Prajapati
 uskaa ek mukh 'brahman' he, doosraa mukh 'kshatriya' hai, teesraa mukh 'baj' pakshi he, chauthaa mukh 'agni' he
 And the fifth face you are yourself
 is prakaar som kii prarthana karne ke uparant garbhaadhan ke liye tatpar stri ke paas baithne se pehle uske hriday kaa sparsh karen or is mantra kaa paath karen—'yatte sumime hridaye hitmant: prajapathu manyehan maa tadvidwansan ten maahan pautramadhan rudam
 'this kind of prayer never leaves the seeker mourning the son
 rishi kaa sanket us mata kii ore he, jo apana doodh apni santaan ko pilaati he
 His milk has a somerset-like defensive force
 usee se balak swasth rahata he
 Mother's milk is a natural process for the child
 prakruti kaa virodh anekanek bhayanak parinaamon kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 In the context of worshiping the mortal for salvation, the sage has shown the importance of life through a beautiful metaphor
 ek samay vaani aadi samast devtaa ahankaar ke vasheebhoot hokar apni-apni mahatt siddh karne ke liye paraspar vivaad karne lage
 Everyone was exited from the body with life
 unke nikal jane se sharir kashtha kii bhaanti chetana-rahit hokar so gaya
 'vani' entered the body alone to prove his supremacy
 vaani ke pravesh karte hi sharir vaani se bolne laga, lekin vah apane sthaan se uth nahin sakaa
 After this, the 'netriadriya' deity entered the body
 tab vah vaani se bolne or netron se dekhne laga, parantu is baar bhi vah uth nahin sakaa
 Then the 'shrotendiya' deity entered the body
 vah sunne laga, bolne bhi laga or dekhne bhi laga
 But even this time he could not get up, he was lying idle
 tatpashchaat us sharir main 'man' ne pravesh kiya
 Through the mind he became thinking, but this time also he could not get up
 tab sabase ant main 'praan' ne us sharir main pravesh kiya
 The body got up and sat as soon as that nature entered
 isse praanon kaa mahatva sarvopari siddh ho gayaan sabhi anya indriyon ne praan main hi, moksh aadi sadhana kii shakti ko sweekaar kiya
 He learned that immortality can be attained only by life and this body can rise up and go towards heaven
 praanon ke dwaara hi, sharir kii samast chetnaayen or indriyaan kaary karti hai
 Therefore, it is due to the association of Brahman by the worship of souls
 praanon ke dwaara hi vishisht gyaan-swaroop parabrahm ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Sampradaya-karma by the father This chapter mentions the process of the father's succession to his son
 rishi kaa kahana he ki apana antim samay aayaa jaanakar, pita ko apane sampoorn uttardayitvon se mukt ho janaa chahie or jo kuch bhi uske paas he, use apane putr ko saunp dena chahie
 The son should also gladly accept the obligation left by his father
 pita ko chahie ki shubhr vastra dhaaran karke apane putr ko apane paas bulaaye or usase kahe-'he putr! main tumhen apni vaak shakti, apane praan, apane netra, apane kaan, apane rasaswadan, apane samast shreshth karm, apane sukh-du:kha, apni maithunjnya shakti tathaa rati-sukh, apni gatishiltaa, apni samast icchhaaen, apni buddhi, apana yash, brahmatej ou apana shreshth swasthya tathaa ann ko pachaane kii shakti aadi sabhi sadgun pradaan karata hum yaa tumhaare bheetar pratishthit karata hoon
 'when the father says this, the son should accept him politely and look towards his left shoulder and with his hands, he will say -' Father! You can get the heaven you desire and all the pleasures there
 ' iske uparant, yadi pita nirog ho, to vah apane putr ko ghar kaa swami banaakar athwa maanakar uske saath nivas kare yaa phir sabhi kuch tyagkar va ghar chhodkar sanyas kaa jivan bitaaye
 Such a father is about to turn to the divine when the time comes
 vastav main uttaradhikaar kaa sahi niyam yahi he
 In this chapter, the sage has given a detailed description of Prana, Pragya and Indri and analyzed their mutual relations
 iske liye samvaad-style kaa sahaara liya gaya he
 Here, through the interactions between Indra and Divodas Raja's son Pratardan, Prana has been described as a form of wisdom and has said that public interest is possible only with this wisdom
 ek baar devasur sangram main, devaataaon kii sahaayta ke liye raja divodas ke putr pratardan swarglok gayi the
 Pleased with his unique martial arts and valor, Indra wanted to give him a boon
 is par pratardan ne kaha-'he devraj! jis shreshth var ko aap maanav-jati ke liye param kalyanyukt maanate hon, vaisaa hi koi shreshth var aap swayan hi mujhe pradaan karen
 After listening to Pratardan, Devraj Indra said - 'rajan! There is no person in this world who asks for a bride for the happiness of others
 aap koi aisa var maangen, jo aapke apane liye ho?'is par pratardan ne koi bhi var grahan karne se inkaar kar diya
 Seeing King Pratardan's ascension of truth, Devraj Indra said - "O Rajan! You know me, my true form? This is the best boon for mankind
 'devraj ke is kathan main pratardan ne pahachaanaa ki indra ne na jane kitne pathbhrasht asuron or rishi-muniyon ko dand diya, par ahankarviheen or nishkaami hone ke kaaran indra kaa bal bhi baankaa nahin hua
 Then he understood that the life which is lived, while doing unarmed deeds and outright ego, is only for human welfare
 at: lok-kalyankari vyakti ke liye nirabhimani or nishkaam karmi hona param aavashyak he
 Only such a person can achieve the true nature of Indra, that is, the soul-like soul, and even the greatest of sinful acts cannot affect him
 yadi daivik pravritiyon kii raksha ke liye kisi aattaayi vyakti kaa vadh bhi karnaa pade, to uskaa bhi paap nahin lagata
 Devraj Indra preached to Pratardan and said that whoever recognizes my true nature, never feels a sin; Because, 'I myself am a form of wisdom
 ' indra aage kahata he ki us praan tathaa shreshth gyaan se yukt aatmaswaroop ke rup main prakhyat, mujh indra kii, tum aayu ou amrit-rup se upasna karo
 He makes it clear that age is life, life itself is life and life itself is immortality
 is sharir main jab tak praan he, tabhi tak aayu he
 It is through this nature that the seeker goes to another world and attains the special pleasure of amritattattva
 jo vyakti 'aayu' or 'amrit' ke rup main indra kii upasna karata he, vah is lok main purnayu ko praapt karata he or swarg ke sukhon kaa paan karata he
 The importance of life in the body is of paramount importance
 yadi praan ke rahete sharir kaa koi ang nasht ho jaye, to bhi sharir jivit rahata he, parantu praan ke na rahane par, ek kshan bhi sharir kaa jivit rahanaa asambhav he
 Prana is the person who realizes action power
 praan hi gyaan main pravriti hone kii shakti detaa he
 It has been called 'pragya-swaroop Prana' or 'atma'
 at: jivan ke utthan ke liye pragna-swaroop is praan kii hi upasna kerani chahie
 Pragya and Prana both reside together in the body and leave this body together with the soul
 pranamya parabrahm kaa yahi darshan he or yahi vigyaan he
 This worship is the main source of public welfare
 sushupt avasthaa main, jab manushya soya hua hota he, tab sabhi indriyaan or gyaan, praan main samahit ho jate hai
 But when he awakens, then all kinds of knowledge, coming out of the soul, merge into their senses and the latent senses become aware
 ise upanishad main maranasann vyakti ke udhaaharan se samajhaayaa he
 a person who is in a dying state, his whole consciousness power leaves the senses and merges into the soul
 us samay vah na to sunata he, na dekhtaa he, na bolta he, ne haath-pair hilaa paata he, na uskaa mastishk hi kaam karata he
 This is the position of a meditation practitioner
 parantu jab vah maranasann vyakti rogon se chhutkaaraa paakar pun: jivit ho uthta he athwa vah dhyansth yogi phir se sahaj jivan main laut aata he, tab unki samast indriyaan apane-apane swabhaav ke anusaar phir se sajag ho uthati hai
 Be guided by the mind
 praan hi sarvapratham 'man' ko jaagrath karata he
 He controls and controls all the senses
 man kaa sidhaa sambandh 'pragna' se he or pragna kaa praan se
 In this way Prana, Pragya and Indri are interdependent
 praantatv se hi pragna he or pragna se hi samast indriyon ko sanchaalan hota he
 When 'prana' which is released from the body, it reverses, then at that time, it reverses with all these senses
 vaani sabhi naamon kaa, naak sabhi gandhon kaa, chakshu sabhi roopon kaa, kaan sabhi dhvaniyon kaa or man sabhi dhyansth vishyon kaa parityag kar detaa he
 Therefore, life is the soul, and wisdom is the soul, who resides in this body simultaneously
 sharir kii samast indriyon kaa parichaalan inhen ke dwaara hota he
 It is through wisdom that he attains cognition according to the nature of all the senses
 pragna ke abhaav main sabhi kaa astitv naganya ho jaataa he
 Without Prana or Pragya, no form, subject or sense can be attained
 jis prakaar rath kii nemi aron ke or are rath kii naabhi ke ashrith hote hai, usee prakaar ke samast indriyaan, pragna ke dwaara hi vidyaman hai
 This wisdom or life is the blissful and immortal form of God
 yah na to achche kaam se vruddhi paata he ou na bure kaary se sankuchit hota he
 It is paradoxical
 yah samast lokon kaa adhipati he or sabakaa swami he
 This soul is our soul
 ise jaanakar hi paramatma kii upasthiti ko anubhav kiya ja saktaa he
 In this chapter, based on the conversation between a Brahmin sage named Gargya and the scholar King Ajatshatru of Kashi, the various powers of the universe have been mentioned in the dialogue style and accepted the 'soul' as 'brahma'
 garg gotra main utpann balaaka rishi ke putr kaa naam gargy rishi ke naam se prasiddh tha
 He was a brilliant scholar of the four Vedas
 ushinar pradesh unka nivasasthaan tha
 He often used to travel in different regions of the country
 kabhi matsay desh main, to kabhi kuru-paanchal main rahane pahunch jate the
 Once while wandering, he reached the Dabar of King Ajatshatru, the scholar of Kashi
 vahaan ve atyant ahankaarpurn vaani main raja se bole-'he rajan! main aapako 'brahmatatv' kaa upadesh duungaa
 On saying such a sage of Gargya, Kashi King Ajatshatru said - 'O Vipravar! For your preaching, i will give you a millenium with a good quality
 mujhe to prasannataa he ki ab tak brahmavidya ke shrota or dani ke rup main mithila naresh janak kaa hi naam tha
 Today, you have come to us and enhanced our pride like Videha Rajak
 ' 'brahmatatva' kaa upadesh dete hue rishi gargy or ajatshatru ke madhya is saprkaar vaartalap hua-rishi gargy—'he rajan! is suryamandal main jo antaryami parameshwar sthit he, main brahmabuddhi se usee kii sadhana karata hum
 'ajatashatru —' o Brahman! It's not like this
 yah shwet vastradhari surya to sabhi se mahaan he
 It is the head of all, centered in the highest position
 jo manushya is viraat purush kii is prakaar se aradhana karata he, vah sabase ucch sthiti main pahunchataa he
 'rishi Gargya -' o Rajan! In the lunar circle, who is this transcendental great man, i worship him as Brahman
 'ajatshatru-'he vipravar! aisa nahin he
 This is the king of Soma and this is also the soul of the food main isi prakaar isaki upasna karata hum
 Whoever worships in this way, surely becomes the soul of the grain and the money is filled with grain
 'rishi gargy-'he rajan! vidyut mandal ke antargat yah jo antaryami viraat parabrahm he, main usee kaa upaask hum
 ‘ajatashatru —’ o Vipravar! It's not like this
 main is vidyut ko 'prakaash kii aatma' maanakar isaki upasna karata hum
 Whoever worships in this way, he himself becomes a 'soul' in the form of light
 'rishi gargy-' he rajan! megh mandal main garjana ke rup main vidyaman us antaryami ishwar ko main saakshaat brahm maanata hum
 ‘ajatashatru —’ o Vipravar! Don't say that main shabd kii aatma samajhakar hi is shreshth tatva kii upasna karata hum
 One who worships in this way, he himself becomes the soul of the word
 'rishi gargy ne phir kaha-'he rajan! akaash mandal main pratishthit parabrahm parameshwar kii main avinashi brahm ke rup main upasna karata hum
 'ajatashatru replied -' o Vipravar! i do not want to say anything about this
 yah to purna, pravriti-rahit brahm, sabhi se vishaal he
 Of course i worship it in this form
 jo aise divya brahm kii upasna karata he, vah samast praaniyon main nirvikaar ho jaataa he
 He does not die before time
 'isi prakaar vaarta ko aage badhaate hue gargy rishi ne vayumandal main sthit viraat purush ko brahm kaha, par ajatshatru ne use indra ke shreshth aishwarya se yukt vaikuntha kaha, jahaan kunthaayen nasht ho jaati hai ou vah sadaiv aparajit rahata he
 After that the sage gave the Virat Purush in the Agni Mandala, the Virat Purush present in the hydrosphere, the Virat Purush reflected in the mirror, the sound in the resonance, the phonetic word rising behind the dynamic Virat Purush, the shadow of the bodily, in the body a Virat Purush situated in the heart, a spirit-like soul with wisdom, a Virat Purush in the right eye, Virat Purush in the left eye
 By present as indestructible Brahman, spoke to worship him
 parantu ajatshatru ne kramash: sabhi ko nakaarte hue agni ko dusron kaa prahaar sahan karne vaala 'vishasahi,' jal main sthit brahm ko namdhari jeevatma, pratibimb ko praturup, pratidhwani ko gati kaa abhavayukt, dhvanyatmak shabd ko 'pranaswaroop', sharir kii chaaya ko mrityu-rup, sharir main sthit viraat purush ko prajapati kaa swaroop, pragna se yukt aatma ko yama kaa swaroop, daahine netra main sthit purush ko naam, agni or jyoti kii aatma, baayen netra main sthit purush ko satya, vidyut or tej kaa aatma bataaya or usee rup main unki upasna karne kii baat kahi
 Hearing of Ajatashatru, the sage Garga became silent and accepted Ajatashatru as his guru, but being a Kshatriya, Ajatashatru did not accept making disciples of Brahmin Gargya
 haa, ekaant main unhen unhen brahm kaa gyaan avashya karaayaa
 They took him to a sleeping person and tried to awaken him by calling him by many names, but when he did not wake up, Ajatshatru picked him up by hitting him with a stick
 uske jaagane par ajatshatru ne rishi gargy se kaha-'he vipravar! yah vyakti is prakaar achet hokar kahaan sota tha or kis pradesh main yah tha or ab jaagane ke baad yah kahaan aa gaya he?' rishi gargy is rahasy ko nahin samaj sake, to raja ajatshatru ne pun: kaha-'rishiver! yah purush jahaan sota tha, vah sthaan praan-rupi hridayakamal he
 There is a famous pulse named 'hita'
 uske dwaara hriday kaa vistaar sampoorn naadiyon tak he, jo bal ke hajaarwein bhaag se bhi sookshm he
 In these channels, the male is situated at bedtime
 is soye hue purush ke hriday main sthit 'praan' kaa sabhi indriyon se sambhaav he
 This life is the shell of the soul
 yah pragnavan aatma isi khol main sookshm rup se usee prakaar virajman rahati he, jaise lakdi kii myaan main talwaar rahati he
 This 'soul' activates the entire 'spirituality' when a man is awake
 tab us 'sakshi-rup aatma' kaa sabhi indriyaan anumat sevak kii bhaanti anusaran karti hai
 The knower, who knows this 'soul', like Indra, by destroying all his enemy asuras or sins, attains the best rank of Triloki
 at: 'aatma' ko jaanane ke liye ahankaar kaa tyaag param aavashyak he
 Only then can he destroy his sins
 kalpavriksha devloak kaa ek vriksh
 It is also known by the names Kalpadrupa, Kalpataru, Surtaru Devataru and Kalpalata etc
 puraanon ke anusaar samudrmanthan se praapt 14 ratnon main kalpavriksha bhi tha
 It was given to Indra and Indra founded it in Surkanan
 hinduon kaa vishwaas he ki kalpavriksha se jis vastu kii bhi yachana kii jaae, vahi yah de detaa he
 It does not even perish
 'tuba' naam se aise hi ek ped kaa varnan islamic dharmik sahitya main bhi miltaa he jo sadaa adan main phulataa faltaa rahata he
 Siddhas, Naths and saints give the noun 'amunni' to Kalpallata or Kalpavallari as according to them, for the attainment of ease or Kaivalya, Amani is the only means which is not only fulfilling all desires but also Avineshwar himself and who gets, Makes him Avineshwar too
 madhyasthata ek vaikalpik vivaad samaadhaan prakram he jisamen pakshakar kisi tisare vyakti ke hastkshep ke madhyam se tathaa nyaayalay kaa sahaara liye bina apane vivaadon kaa niptaan karavaate hai
 It is a method in which a dispute is placed before a nominated person who, after hearing both sides, decides the issue in a quasi-judicial manner
 udaahranarth 'panch' yaa 'panchayat' ko koi vivaad sanderbhit karnaa madhyastham kaa ek rup he
 Generally, the disputing parties refer their case to an arbitral tribunal and the decision taken by the tribunal is called an 'award'
 madhyastham kaa prayog mukhyat: vyapaar kshetron main kiya jaataa he jaise nirmaan pariyojnaayen, nauvahan tathaa sanvahan, patent, kaarobaar chihn tathaa brands, vittiya sevaayen jinamein banking tathaa beemaa shaamil he, videshi sahyog, bhagidaari vivaad ityadi
 Conciliation is the process of amicable settlement of disputes by the parties with the help of the conciliator
 yah madhyastham se is arth main bhinn he ki madhyastham main award tisare pakshakaar yaa madhyastham nyaaydhikaran kaa nirnay he jabaki samaadhaan ke maamle main nirnay pakshakaron kaa hota he jise samadhankarta kii madhyastham se liya jaataa he
 Such methods of dispute resolution are more advantageous than legal litigation: madhyasth ke kaary is prakaar he:- Jashoda Nand was an MLA in the Fourth Assembly of Uttar Pradesh, India

 Pediatrics is the branch of psychology that studies the mental development of a human being from pregnancy to adulthood
 jahaan saamaanya manovigyaan praudh vyaktiyon kii maansik kriyaaon kaa varnan karata he tathaa unako vaigyanik dhang se samajhane kii cheshtaa karata he, vahiin baalamanovigyaan baalkon kii maansik kriyaaon kaa varnan karata or unhen samajhane kaa praytn karata he

 Herbert Spencer has emphasized that pediatric psychology should be compulsory in the education of every citizen
 baalamanovigyaan ke gyaan ke bina safal grihasth jivan vyateet nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Earlier in the 18th century Rousseau also stated the need of child psychology for the education of the child and some wrote in his book "emile", regarding the psychosis of the child based on his personal experience, but the views of scholars like Rousseau scientist
 Were not based on experiments
 baalkon ke shaareerik or maansik vikaas kaa vaigyanik dhang se adhyayan pichley 80 varshon se hi ho rahaa he
 Early studies of pediatrics took place in France
 paris ke pikaat mahashay ne baalamanovigyaan ke liye "thot and languej ov di child" naamak pustak ke rup main apni moulik dein di
 At the same time, Dr
 Vinay conducted intelligent exams to test the children with mental retardation
 bine ne jis kaam kii shuruyaat kii vah baalamanovigyaan or shiksha ke vikaas ke liye bada mahatvapurn siddh hua
 Several types of intelligent examinations have developed in different countries of the world and now they are being used in almost all the countries of the world
 germany ke vidwaanon ne balak ke seekhney kii prakriyaaon par anek prayog kiye or seekhney kii kriya ke gudh rahasy ko samajhane ke moulik siddhanton kaa anveshan kiya
 These scholars have tried to show similarities in the learning system of Balaman and Pashman and have tried to show that the mental development that begins with the monkey and the banamanus continues in human life
 europe ke vidwaanon kii adhiktar khojon kaa upyog england kii shiksha ke kshetra main kiya gaya he
 There was a special development of intelligent examinations here
 balak kii bhinn bhinn yogyataon main aapasi sambandh kya he, yah jaanane kii cheshtaa kii gai
 The experiments of Searman and Tomson in this direction are of utmost importance

 Dr
 Sildwert's study of delinquent children is a matter of importance
 dow homerlen ke apradhi baalkon ke sudhaar sambandhi prayog bhi mahatv ke hai
 Extensive work on child psychology has been done by the efforts of scholars from USA
 jo kaam simit rup se duusare dashon main kiya gaya, vah susangathit or vistrut dhang se america main hua he
 Even today, hundreds of scholars in America are studying different conditions of child development in many scientific laboratories
 dow stenle haal ne kishor baalkon kaa jaisaa adhyayan kiya he, vaisaa sansar main duusari jagah nahin hua
 His book titled "adolescence" is of importance to pedophilia
 aaj macorthon, gudenf, aadi vidvan bacchon ke kriyakalapon par anek pakaar ke adhyayan kar rahe hai
 The methods of pedophilia are usually those which are of general psychology
 baalamanovigyaan main vahya nirikshan ko adhik mahatv diya jaataa he
 Children's behavior is monitored spontaneously and another according to special rules
 baalamanovigyaan ke aankadon ko praapt karne ke liye jin upayon ko kaam main laayaa jaataa he unamem pramukh hai : suvyavasthit vaigyanik nirikshan, prayog, jivaniyon kaa adhyayan, diary lekhan, prashnawali, antardarshan or manovishleshan
 Talk about the behavior of children comes from many places - parents and teachers observe the behavior of children every day, so a lot can be known about their development from them
 yadi unhen balavyavahaar ke nirikshan kii training de di jaae, to unka kathan bahut upyogi ho jaataa he
 Specialists in pedophilia have been writing routines of their children's behaviors since childhood
 inaki ye diariyaan badi upyogi siddh hui hai
 Some great men have written their childhood experiences in their biographies and some have written childhood stories by their friends, or those who revere or love them
 in jivaniyon se bhi acchhee saamagree ikatthi ho jaati hai
 Some psychologists have obtained useful information from parents and teachers by making questionnaires
 bahut si baaten baalkon se prashn poochkar bhi gyaat kii jaati he
 Additionally Dutt of importance is gathered by special psychological experiments
 manovaigyanik prayogon ke liye vishesh prakaar kii shiksha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the present time, many important experiments are being conducted on the learning process of children, their memory and development of intelligence
 balavyavahaar or balvikas sambandhi anek upyogi baaten bacchon ke doctoron se tathaa bal sudhaar grihon se bhi milti hai
 Talk about the physical development of children, especially from doctors
 yah spasht he ki baalamanovigyaan ke nirmaan main shikshakon, doctoron, samajashastriyon dwaara, sabhi kii sahaayta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Psychologists have created special tests to ascertain the qualifications, interests, values of life and sociality of children
 baalkon ke kriyakalapon kaa vishesh nirikshan karne ke liye ek aise kamare kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he jisamen paardarshakta keval ek ore hoti he
 This allows the psychologist to watch the child's actions without the child's knowledge
 is prakaar kaa dekhnaa balak ke swaabhaavik vyavhaar ke adhyayan ke liye aavashyak hota he
 Movies and tape records are also used to study child behavior and its language development
 inase manovaigyanik balak kii ek baar kii hui kriyaaon kaa, athwa ek samay kii baatcheet kaa, apni fursat main adhyayan kar letaa he
 Due to these applications, there are no common mistakes of memory

 tara hindu mahakavy ramayana main vanararaj wali kii patni he
 Tara's intelligence, direct-mindedness, courage and devotion to her husband have been praised in all mythological texts
 tara ko hindu dharm ne panchakanyaon main se ek mana he
 In the mythological texts, it is said about Panchkanya: - ahilya draupadi kunti tara mandodari tathaa
 Panchakanya Smritiyan Mahapakahak Nashak haalanki tara ko mukhya bhoomika main valmiki ramayana main keval teen hi jagah darshaya gaya he, lekin uske charitra ne ramayana katha ko samajhanevaalon ke man main ek amit chhap chhod di he
 The three places where Tara's character is in the lead role are as follows: - kuch granthon ke anusaar vah devataaon ke guru brihaspati kii pautri thi
 According to a legend, during the Samudra Manthan, one of the fourteen monies were nymphs
 unheen apsaraon main se ek tara thi
 Both Vali and Sushen were helping the deities in the manthan
 jab unhone tara ko dekha to donon main use patni banane kii hode lagi
 Vali stood on Tara's right side and Sushen on his left
 tab vishnu ne faisalaa sunaaya ki vivaah ke samay kanya ke dahini taraf uskaa hone vaala pati tathaa baayin taraf kanyadan karne vaala pita hota he
 So Vali Tara's husband and Sushen were declared her father
 ram ke yah aashwaasan dene par ki ram swayan wali kaa vadh karenge, sugriv ne wali ko lalakaara
 Vali came out hearing the challenge
 donon main ghamaasan yuddh hua, parantu kyonki dono bhaaiyon kii mukh tathaa deh rachana samaan thi, isliye ram ne asamanjas ke kaaran apana baan nahin chalaaya
 Finally Vali defeated Sugriva and drove him away
 sugriv niraash hokar phir ram ke paas aa gaya
 Rama this time asked Lakshmana to put a garland around Sugriva's neck so that he would not make any mistake in recognizing Sugriva during the duel and asked Sugriva to challenge Vali again
 sugriv ne kiskindha ja kar wali ko phir se dwandv ke liye lalakaara
 When Vali again heard Sugriva's shout, he could not bear the brunt of his anger
 tara ko shaayad is baat kaa bodh ho gaya tha ki sugriv ko ram kaa sangrakshan hasil he kyonki akele to sugriv wali ko dobaaraa lalkaarane kii himmat kadaapi nahin karata
 So Tara tried to warn the Vali due to fear of something untoward
 usne yahan tak kaha ki sugriv ko kiskindha kaa rajkumaar ghoshit kar wali uske saath sandhi kar le
 But Vali reprimanded her with the suspicion that Tara was taking an unfair side of Sugriva
 kintu usne tara ko yah aashwaasan diya ki vah sugriv kaa vadh nahin karegaa or sirf use acha sabak sikhayega
 It is believed that the arrow that Rama shot at the Vali was a simple arrow, that is, there were many weapons in Rama's quiver that could have destroyed the entire civilization in a moment, like Brahmastra etc
 lekin maryaada purushottam ram — jo ki vishnu kaa avatar the or sarvagyaata the — ne ek saadhaaran sa hi tir isliye chalaaya kyonki wali kii turant mrityu na ho or marane se pehle use apane prashnon kaa uttar bhalee bhaanti praapt ho jaye taaki vah shanti se praan tyaag sake or marane se pehle vah swajanon se bhalee bhaanti mil sake
 Hearing the news of Vali being hurt, Tara along with her son Angad ran towards the battlefield
 raste main use ran se bhaagate hue vanar mili jinhone use salaah di ki angad ko lekar waapas kiskindha jaakar angad kaa rajbhishek kar de or ram ke prakope se batch jaye
 But Tara carried that group of monkeys with her and proceeded towards the mortal
 vahaan ja kar wali ke samaksh tara kaa vilaap ati mahatvapurn he kyonki manushya ke alaava koi or praani apane swajan ke marane par itnaa vilaap nahin karata he
 First, Tara engages the dying person, then after that she tells Sugriva and Rama the perfect khuti
 hanuman madhyasthata karte hue tara ko dhants bandhaate hai or use darshan shaastra samajhaate hai
 It is a unique reference that Tara resolved to give up her life in Vali's funeral pyre
 iskaa abhipraay yah he ki sati pratha hamaare samaaj main pracheen kaal se chali aa rahi he
 In this context, it would be appropriate to say that no ordinary woman can say the words she uttered during her mourning
 usko raajnneeti tathaa kootneeti kaa acha gyaan tha or isi vajah se vaanron ke kehane ke baavjood usne angad kaa rajbhishek na kara kar sugriv ko hi raja manonit kiya
 As no one could face his son, he accepted Sugriva as his lord
 wali ke vadh ke pashchaat tara ne yahi uchit samajha ki sugriv ko swami sweekaar kare kyonki usne angad ke hiton kii raksha bhi to kerani thi
 When Sugriva got engrossed in Rajollas and forgot the promise of Rama to find Sita, Rama sent Lakshmana to remind him of his promise
 lakshmana vaise bhi kaafii gussell the
 He almost invaded Kishkindha's capital, Pampapur
 sugriv ko apni galati kaa ahsaas ho gaya lekin lakshmana kaa saamana karne kii uski himmat na hui
 He urges Tara to calm Laxman
 tara ranivas se madonmatta nikali or lakshmana ko shant kiya
 He gave the example of Maharishi Vishwamitra that even such Mahatmas were helpless in front of sensual pleasures, then what is the status of Sugriva and also that he is not a man but a monkey
 tara ne yah bhi varnan kiya ki sugriv ne chaaron dishaao main sena ekatrit karne ke liye doot bhej diye hai
 In the Valmiki Ramayana and adaptations of other languages, it is mentioned that Lakshman, after listening to the arguments of Madanamatta Tara with half-baked nayanas, became a little silent and after that he went back after assuring Sugriva's arrival and finding Sita from him
 ramayana ke kuch kshetreey roopantaranon main yah bhi darshaya gaya he ki jis samay lakshmana ne kiskindha kii rajdhani ke rajmahal ke garbhaagrih main krodhit hokar pravesh kiya tha us samay sugriv ke saath madiraa-paan karne vaali uski pratham patni rumaa nahin apitu tara thi or bhoga vilaas main vah donon tallin the
 It is appropriate to remind here that while befriending Rama, Sugriva regretted the loss of his wife Ruma by more than the loss of his kingdom
 lekin tara jaisi sahabhaagini paakar sugriv apni preeya patni rumaa ko bhi bhul gaya
 It is mentioned in many adaptations of Ramayana that when Vali passed a long time while fighting with Mayavi and Sugriva closed a door by placing a stone in the mouth of Kandra and returned to Kishkindha and informed the ministers that If Vali is killed at the hands of Mayavi, the ministers have chosen Sugriva to be the king of Kishkindha, and Tara, apparently widowed, is younger than her husband
 His wife was accepted
 is pratha ko na to valmiki ramayana main or na hi uske kshetreey roopantaranon main paap kaa darja diya gaya he
 But when Vali comes back to Kishkindha after killing Mayavi and expels Sugriva due to anger and usurps his wife Ruma, during sugriva-rama meeting in Kishkindhand, Rama calls it a gross sin
 wali ke vadh ke baad bhi tara punah sugriv kii patni ban gai
 Perhaps the practice of multi-wife and multi-husband practice has been acceptable in the society of that period

 With the passage of time, this shortcoming was overcome by changing the billing on the SMSC from switch billing and providing some new features within the SMSC that could prevent foreign mobile users from sending messages through it
