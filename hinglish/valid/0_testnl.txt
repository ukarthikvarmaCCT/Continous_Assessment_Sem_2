 The trial of Azad Hind Fauj at Red Fort, Delhi in November 1945 led to an indescribable increase in Netaji's fame and he reached the peak of popularity
 angrejon ke dwaara kiye gayi vidhivat dushprachaar tathaa tatkaaleen pramukh raajnneetik dalon dwaara subhash ke virodh ke baavjood saare desh ko jhakzor denevaale us mukademe ke baad matayen apane beton ko ‘subhash’ kaa naam dene main garv kaa anubhav karne lageen
 At home, Netaji's portrait also appeared on the combination of Rana Pratap and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 aaazaad hind fouj ke madhyam se bharat ko angrejon ke changul se aaazaad karne kaa netaji kaa prayaas pratyaksh rup main safal nahin ho sakaa kintu uskaa doorgaami parinaam hua
 The Naval Rebellion of 1946 is an example of this
 nausena vidroh ke baad hi britain ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ab bhartiya sena ke bal par bharat main shashan nahin kiya ja saktaa or bharat ko swatantra karne ke alaava unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa
 Except for the Azad Hind Fauj, there is no such instance in world history where thirty-thirty thousand war prisoners have organized and waged such a strong struggle for the independence of their country
 jahaan swatantrata se purv videshi shaasha netaji kii samarthy se ghabaraate rahe, to swatantrata ke uparant deshi sattadhish janamanas par unke vyaktitv or kartrutv ke amit prabhaav se ghabaraate rahe
 Swatantraveer Savarkar organized a conference of revolutionaries after independence and placed Netaji's oil painting on the seat of the Speaker
 yah ek krantivir dwaara duusare kranti vir ko di gayi abhootpurv salaami thi
 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has naturally been keen on writing in spite of his struggling and extremely busy life
 apni apurna aatmakatha ek bhartiya yatri ke atirikt unhone do khandon main ek puri pustak bhi likhi bharat kaa sangharsh, jiskaa landan se hi pratham prakaashan hua tha
 This book became very famous
 unki aatmakatha yadhyapi apurna hi rahi, lekin use purna karne kii unki abhilaashaa rahi thi, jiskaa pataa mul pandulipi ke pratham prishth par banaayi gayi yojana se spasht roopen chalata he
 Apart from this, Netaji wrote numberless letters in the context of his multi-dimensional freedom struggle, gave speeches and his lectures were also broadcast through radio
 patron kii ek badi maatra unke nijee jivan se bhi sambaddh he
 From December 1940 till the last time of Netaji, his full confidant and close associate Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose established the Netaji Research Bureau and started the massive work of publishing Netaji's 'samagra Sahitya' mainly in association with Vinod C
 Chaudhary in 1961 AD
 And in 1980, the work of compilation of 12 volumes of compositions began
 aarambhik yojana 10 khandon main 'samgr sahitya' ke prakaashan kii thi, parantu baad main yah yojana 12 khandon kii ho gayi
 Its first volume was first published in Bangla in April 1980 and in English in November 1980
 hindi main iskaa pratham khand 1982 main prakashit hua or phir in teenon bhashaaon main samgr sahitya kaa prakaashan hote rahaa
 Its final volume was published in 2011 AD; Although its contents were already ready
 is 'samgr vaanmay' ke sankalan evam prakaashan kaary se aarambh se hi sugat bose bhi jude hue the or antim do khandon kaa prakaashan dow0 shishir kumaar bose ke dukhad nidhan ke kaaran mukhyatah sugat bose ke hi sampadan main hua
 In the first volume of this 'composite Society', some papers have been published along with his 'autobiography' and in the second volume his famous book 'struggle of India' has been published
 phir anya khandon main unke dwaara likhit patron, tippaniyon evam bhaashanon aadi samgr uplabdh sahitya kaa krambaddh prakaashan hua he
 In this way, as much as possible, written and textual reading of Netaji has become accessible for 'overall speech' study and it is an age-old requirement that in the context of Netaji like Mahatma Gandhi, to form an opinion based on many contextual statements and incomplete information
 Instead of looking at the appropriate issue in its appropriate and appropriate contexts, accurate and authentic opinion should be formed

 One came from 'maine' and the other from 'california'

 There was so much similarity between their taste and food preferences that a mixed studio was born
 yah baat may ke maheene kii thi
 In the winter of November, an unknown stranger, who doctors call 'pneumonia'
 muhalle main deraa daal kar, apni barfili ungaliyon se logon ko chhedana shuru kiya
 In the eastern region, this Satyanshi had created a scare with the sacrifice of many people, but in the trap of the narrow streets of the west, his movement slowed down a bit
 mistar 'nimonia' striyon ke saath bhi koi riayat nahin karte the
 a slim girl who had lost her blood due to the California storms had no match with this giant rocking monster, yet she attacked Jansi
 vah bechaari chupchaap apni lohe kii khaat par padi rahati or shishe kii khidki main se saamne ke iton ke makaan kii kori diwaar ko dekha karti
 One day the old doctor treating him, shaking the thermometer, called Suu to the outside verandah and said, "the possibility of his living is two rupees and that too if his willpower remains
" jab logon ke man main jeene kii ichha hi nahi rahati or ve maut kaa swaagat karne ko taiyaar ho jate hai to unka ilaaj dhanvantari bhi nahin kar sakate
 This girl has a ghost on her mind that she will no longer be good
 kya uske man par koi boj he?" Soo said, "nothing else, but he has a strong desire to paint the Bay of Naples every day
" " "chitra? Hoon! i was asking, is there any attraction in his life that intensifies the desire to live? Like a young man!" bichchhu ke dank kii-si chubhti aawaaj main su boli," noujvaan? purush or prem-chodo bhi-nahin doctor sahab, ansi koi baat nahin he
 " doctor bolaa,"sari buraai kii jad yahi he
 According to medical education, i will not leave without doing what is possible
 par jab koi marij apni arthi ke saath chalane waalon kii sankhya ginaney laga jaataa he tab dawaaiyon kii shakti aadhi rah jaati he
 If you can create any attraction in her life, due to which she starts discussing about the fashion of clothes that are prevalent in the next winter, then her chances of living will be at least double
 " After the doctor left, Suu went to her room and she wept and squeezed several handkerchiefs
 kuch der baad, chitrakaari kaa saamaan lekar, vah siti bajaati hui jansi ke kamare main pahunchi
 Jansi, clad in a cloak, stared silently, looking at the window
 use soi hui jaan kar usne siti bajaanaa band kar diya
 Putting paper on the planks, she sat down to draw a picture with pen ink for the story of a magazine
 navdith kalakaaron ko 'kala' kii manzil tak pahunchane keliye, patrikaon ke liye tasviren banani hi padati he
 For example, to reach the destination of literature, budding writers have to write stories in magazines
 jyon hi su, ek ghudsavaar jaisaa brijas pahane, ek aankh kaa chashma lagaaye, kisi idaho ke gadhriye ke chitra kii rekhaaen banane lagi ki use ek dhimi aawaaj anek baar duharaati-si sunai di
 She soon went to the sick bed
 jansi kii ankhe khuli thim
 She was looking out of the window and talking some count
 lekin vah ulta jap kar rahi thi
 She said, "twelve" then "eleven" then "ten" and "nine" and then together "eight" and "seven"
 su ne utkantha se, khidki ke baahar najar daali
 What was worth counting there
 ek khulaa, banjar chowk yaa bees fit dur eenton ke makaan kii kori diwaar! An old, snooty, inlaid, protruding
 The evergreen vine was halfway up the wall
 shishir kii thandi saanso ne uske sharir kii pattiyaan tod lee thim or uski kankal shakhaaen, ekadam ughadi, un tuuti-phuti iton se latak rahi thim
 Soo asked, "what is Jani?" atyant dhime swaron main jansi boli,"chha:! ab ve jaldi-jaldi gir rahi hai
 Three days ago there were about one hundred
 unhen ginate-ginate sir dukhane lagaataa tha
 She fell one more
 ab bachi sirf paanch
 " "paanch kya? jaani, paanch kya? apni su ko to bataa!" "leaves
 us bel kii pattiyaan
 The moment the last leaf falls, i too will leave
 mujhe teen din se iskaa pataa he
 Didn't the doctor tell you? " atyant tiraskaar ke saath su ne shikaayat kii, "oh! itani bevakoof to kahin nahi dekhi
 How is your recovery related to these leaves? You used to love that bull - why? naughty! Close your stupidity! Just this morning, the doctor told that the possibility of your recovery - where exactly were the words - said yes, the possibility is fourteen rupees and in New York, when we sit in a taxi or a new building
 Pass through, even then the possibility of living is no more than this
 ab thodaa shorwa pine kii koshish kar or apni su ko tasviir banane de, taaki use sampadak mahoday ke haathon bech kar vah apane biimaar bacchee ke liye thodi dawa-daaru or apane khud ke pet ke liye kuch roti-pani laa sake
 " apni ankhon ko khidki ke baahar tikaaye jansi boli,"tumhen ab mere liye sharaab laane kii jarurat nahin
 She fell one more
 nahin mujhe shorwe kii bhi jarurat nahin
 Now only four are left
 andheraa hone se pahile us aakhri pattee ko girte hue dekh luun-bas
 Then i will also leave
 " Soo bowed down on her, 'dear Jansi! You must promise that you will keep your eyes closed and will not look out of the window while i work
 kal tak ye tasviir pahunchaa deni hai
 i need light, or else close the window now
 " Jansi asked Rukhai, "can't you sit in another room and make pictures?" su ne kaha,"mujhe tere paas hi rahanaa chahiye
 Also, i do not want to let you look at that vine
 " Like a fallen idol, immaculate and white, closing his eyes, Jansi said, "speak to me as soon as i am finished, because i want to see that last leaf fall
 ab apni har pakad ko dhilaa chhodana chaahati hum or un bichaari thakee hui pattiyon kii tarah tairti hui neeche-neeche-neeche chalijana chaahati hum
 " su ne kaha," tu sone kii koshish kar
 i call that Behrman to be a laborer in the mine
 abhi, ek minute main aayi
 Don't move until i return! " boodha beharman unke neeche hi ek kamare main rahata tha
 He was also a painter
 uski umr saath saal se bhi adhik thi
 His beard, like the mosaic beard of Michael Angelo's picture, seemed to be waving from the head of a rogue monkey to the body of a ghost
 berahamam ek asafal kalakaar tha
 He had been doing meditation for forty years, but had not even touched the stage of his art yet
 vah har tasviir ko banaate samay yahi sochataa ki yah uski utkrasht krati hogi, par kabhi bhi waisi bana nahin paata
 Here, for many years, he had left this business, except making commercial or advertising pictures
 un navayuvak kalakaaron ke liye mandal banakar, jo kisi peshewar mandal kii fis nahin chukaa sakate the, vah aajkal apana pet bharta tha
 He would drink too much alcohol and talk nonsense about his masterpiece, which he cherished
 vaise vah bada khoonkhaar boodha tha, jo namr aadamiyon kii joardaar majaak udaata or apane ko in donon jawan kalakaaron kaa paharedaar kutta samajha karata
 Soo finds Behrman lying in his dark base
 usamen se ber kii guthliyon-si gandh aa rahi thi
 In one corner stood the blank blanket, which had been waiting for twenty-five years to mark the first line of his illustrious art
 usne buudhe ko bataaya ki kaise jansi un patton ke saath apane pattey jaise komal sharir kaa sambandh jod kar, unke samaan bah jane kii bhaybheet kalpana karti he or sochati he ki uski pakad sansar par dhili ho jaayegi
 The old Behrman angrily expressed his disdain at these foolish fantasies
 vah bolaa,"kya kaha? kya abhi tak duniya main aanse murkh bhi hai, jo sirf isliye ki ek ukhdi hui bel se pattey jhad rahe hai, apane marane kii kalpana kar lete he? maine to aansa kahin nahin suna! main tumhaare jaise bevakoof paaglon ke liye kabhi model nahin ban saktaa
 How did you allow this thing to enter your mind? Hey, Bachari Jansi! " su ne kaha,"vah beemaari se bahut kamjor ho gayi he or bukhaar ke kaaran hi uske dimag main ansi ajeeb-ajeeb kalushit kalpanaaen jaag uthi hai
 good; Old Behrman, don't be me if you don't want to be a model for me
 ho to aakhir ullu ke patthe hi!" Berhman shouted, "you are a girl's girl! Who said i will not be a model? Come, i go with you
" aadhe ghante se yahi to zinc rahaa hum ki bhai chalata hum-chalata hu! lekin ek baat kahuun- yah jagah jansi jaisi acchhee ladki ke marane laayak nahin he
 Someday, when i create my masterpiece, then we will all walk from here
 samajhi? haa!" When they reached the top, Jancy was sleeping
 su ne khidakiyon ke parde gira diye or beharman ko duusare kamare main le gayi
 From there they looked at the vine outside the window with frightened eyes
 fir unhone, bina ek bhi shabd bole, ek-duusare kii ore dekha
 The cold rainy snowfall was falling continuously with him
 ek ketli ko ulta karke us par neeli kameez main beharman ko bithaaya gaya jisase chattan par baithe huye, kisi khan ke majdoor kaa model ban jaye
 After an hour's sleep, when Suu's eyes opened in the morning on the second day, he saw that Jansi was rooting, tearing her eyes towards the green curtain of the window
 surasurahat ke swar main usne aadesh diya,"parde uthaa de, mai dekhnaa chaahati hum
 " vivash hokar su ko ajna manani padi
 But what is this! Even after rain, thunderstorms and snow fall overnight, there was a leaf in the vine, which was attached to the brick wall
 apane danthal ke paas kuch gahari hari, lekin apane kinaaron ke aasapaas thakaavat or or jhadane kii ashanka liye pili-pili, vah pattee jameen se koi bees foot oonchi abhi tak apni daali se latakarhi thi
 Jansy said, "this is the last
 maine sochaa tha ki yah raat main jarur hi gir jaaygi
 i also heard the sound of the storm
 khayr, koi baat nahin yah aaj gir jaayegi or usee samay main bhi mar jaaungin
 " takiye par apana thakaa hua cheharaa jhukaa kar su boli,"kya kahati he pagal! apana nahin to kam se kam meraa khyaal kar! main kya karuungi?" But Jansi did not respond
 is duniya kii sabase akeli vastu yah 'aatma' he, jab vah apni rahasyamayi lambi yatra par jane kii taiyaari main hoti he
 As the world and its bondage bound by friendship began to loosen, its imagination began to push it harder
 din biit gaya or sandhya ke ksheen prakaash main bhi, diwaar se lagi hui bel se lataka hua vah patta, unhen dikhaai detaa rahaa
 But just as night fell, the northern winds started moving again and the rain fell on the balcony, hitting the window
 roshni hote hi nirdayee jansi ne aadesh diya ki parde uthaa diye jaye
 The leaf was still present in the vine
 jansi bahut der tak usee ko ekatak dekhati rahi
 He called Suu, who was making chicken broth on the stove in the foursome
 jansi boli,"sudi, main bahut hi kharaab ladki hum
 Some power of nature, stopping that last leaf right there, told me how wicked i am
 is tarah maranaa to paap he
 La, give me some broth and mix some milk with poison
 par nahin, usase pehle mujhe jaraa sheesha de or mere sirahaane kuch takiye laga, taaki main baithe-baithe tuje khaanaa banaate hue dekh sakuun
 " koi ek ghannte baad vah boli,"sudi, mujhe lagata he ki main kabhi na kabhi neples kii khadi kaa chitra jarur banaaungi
 " shaam ko doctor sahab fir aaye su, kuch bahaanaa banaakar, unase baahar jaakar mili
 Taking the weakly trembling hand in his hands, Dr
 Sahib said, "now the possibility can be considered eight
 agar paricharya acchhee hui to tum jeet jaaogi or ab main, neeche kii manzil par, ek-duusare marij ko dekhne ja rahaa hum
 What is his name- Behrman! - May be an artist - has pneumonia
 atyant durbal or bura aadmi he or jhapat jor kii lagi he
 No chance of survival
 aaj use aspataal bhijwan duungaa
 There will be more rest
 " The other day the doctor told Soo, "jansi, now out of danger
 tumhaari jeet hui
 Now, only diet and care is needed
 " In the evening that day, Suu came and sat near Jansi's bed
 vah neeli oon kaa ek bekaar-sa gulband, nishcint hokar bun rahi thi
 He put his arm in Soo's neck, from that side of the pillow
 su boli,"meri bholi billi, tujhse ek baat kehani he
 In the hospital this morning, Mr
 Behrman died of pneumonia
 vah sirf do roj biimaar rahaa
 The day after morning, the watchman found him in his room suffering from pain
 uske kapade-yahaan tak ki juute bhi puri tarah se bhiige hue or barf ke samaan thande ho rahe the
 Nobody knows where he went on such a terrible night
 lekin uske kamare se ek jalati hui laalaten, ek nasahni, do-chaar brush or falak par kuch haraa or pilaa rang milaayaa hua mila
 Just look out of the window and see the last leaf near the wall
 kya tuje kabhi aashcharya nahin hua ki itani aandhi or toofaan main bhi vah pattee hilti kyon nahin? pyaari sakhi, yahi beharman kii utkrasht kalakrati thi jis raat ko antim pattee giri usee raat usne uskaa nirmaan kiya tha

 Kravidanta or 'criodonta' is an ancient animal class

 This is the specialty of the creatures of this caste
 aisa prathit hota he ki is varg ke jeevon kaa ek alag hi vansh tha, jo criteshas or peleosin yugon ke ketahariyon kii pehali shakha main thi
 Crafts were in the early stages of development and they were also small in size, like insectivores

 The nature of meat eating is manifested by the gradual development of their teeth and anatomy
 mansabhakshan hi is jati ke pashuon kii visheshta he, parantu in aadi kravyadanton main maance kaatane ke daant nahin hote the
 The lines of their teeth have evolved, except for the first primolar and the last molar, and their tearing teeth have not been as simple and simple as other teeth and similar ancestors of its predatory insect animals
 praaia: purna viksit thim
 Over time, their teeth began to vary in texture and some dogs became larger and more pointed like the canine tusks
 in pracheen kravyadant mansabhakshiyon kii dantarachana mulat: pracheen kitbhakshiyon kii bhanti milti thi
 According to the experts named Cope and Mathew, the Mysidi animals of the Paleocene and Eocene eras belonged to the family of Cravadanta
 inhen donon ke anusaar micidi vyaghr parivaar ke jantuon or kutta parivaar ke praaniyon se inak udgam hua
 In this way, the ancestors of modern carnivorous animals with pointed teeth are obscure in the Paleocene era
 ye chote mansabhakshi jeev choti-choti jhaadiyon yaa jangalon main rahete the
 These trees also used to climb in search of their prey and to protect themselves
 inamen kuch mansabhakshi, kuch sarvabhakshi or kuch kitbhakshi the
 The brain of some of these cravings eating rotten meat was of very small size and their intelligence was also in its lowest state

 The legends are divided into the following three subclasses: inhen arctoconeodei bhi kehete he
 These are the observances of the Tertiary era, which reached the peak of their numbers in the Paleocene era

 Arctosione of the upper layers of the Paleocene era of Europe is similar to that of present-day bears

 There were cracks in their thumbs and the composition of their teeth was also very simple

 There also seems to be a development in large size among the creeds of this caste
 inke daanton kii rachana main bhi ab visheshta dikhaai padati he
 Their teeth were not suitable for incision, but their teeth have a special type of blunt, with which the animals of this subclass broke and chewed their prey and their bones very easily

 Mongolia's last achroody was the longest of all the legends

 There is a third caste of poets
 chirane-faadane vaale daant inaki visheshta hai
 They used to live by attacking other animals
 inaki sharir rachana is kaary ke liye vishesh rup se anukool thi
 In the early stages of development, this subclass was divided into two branches Oxididae and Hynodontidae
 in donon shakhaon ke kravyadanton main keval itnaa antar tha ki pratham shrenee ke kravyadanton ke upree bhaag kaa pratham molr tathaa nichle bhaag kaa duusari molr daant ab purna rup se kaatane ke liye ban gaye
 Similarly, in the second category of crevices, the second molar of the upper part and the third molar in the lower jaw were used
 peleosin yug main is jati ke kravyadanton kaa vikaas apni paraakaashtha par pahunch gaya tha, parantu iske pashchaat hi inkaa hraas teevr gati se prarambh hua
 We also find signs of living beings of this caste in the Eocene era
 is jati ke kravyadant ati pracheen shaf varg yaa khuravaale praaniyon ke shikaar par jivan nirvaah karte the
 At the end of these 'shaf' class beings, this line of cravings also gradually disappeared, and in the Eligocene, instead of these cravings, a new life resembled them, which was called Phisiped
 inamen jivan rachana ucch shrenee kii thi, kintu ye bhi chote aakaar ke the or apane purvajon ke samaan mansabhakshi swabhaav or aakaar ke the
 By changing these according to the circumstances with these ancestral forms, in the course of time many branches of carnivores became
 junglee jeev har us vriksh, paudhe, jaanavar or anya jeev ko kehete hai jise maanvon dwaara paaltu na banaaya gaya ho
 Wild creatures are found in all the ecosystems of the world, including deserts, forests, grasslands, plains, mountains and urban areas
 vanya jeev junglee jeevon kii vah shrenee he jo maanav baseron se bahaar wanon-parvaton main rahete hon
 In contrast, wild animals like squirrels, pigeons and bats also live in cities outside the forests

 In many cultures, there is a profound difference between domesticated and wild animals

 tallpadu main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke kadap jile kaa ek gaanv he
 a closed watershed or inclusive watershed is a geography called a watershed area in which rain or melting ice water collects and stops at a lake, marshy area or dry area instead of flowing into the sea or ocean through a river
 aam taur par jo bhi pani dharti par barish yaa himpat ke kaaran padataa he wo nadiyon, nehron or jharanon ke dwaara oonche ilaakon se nichle ilaakon kii ore bahata he
 These moving groups of water keep converging with each other until a single big river is formed
 phir yah nadi aage chalakar kisi sagar main mil jaati he
 But in areas which are isolated from the seas due to slopes, mountains or deserts, the water stops at the lowest place
 aise sthanon par yaa to jhilein ban jaati hai yaa dharti pani ko sokh leti he
 Some of the largest lakes in the world have some lakes formed due to such closed watersheds, such as the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea
 angrezi main band jalsambar ko "endorheik basin" kaha jaataa he
 Geographically it is seen that the closed watershed areas are often also desert areas
 aisa isliye he ke agar pani ek hi sthaan par ikkatha hone se uski maatra badhati hi jaae to antat pani apane or samudr ke bich kii rukawat ko parajeet kar hi detaa he
 Scientists speculate that at some time Krishna Sagar was such a closed watershed lake which broke its boundaries due to rising water and got into the Mediterranean Sea
 khule jalsambharon main jo namak or anya padaarth milte rahete hai ve aage chalakar sagar main bah jate hai
 This does not happen in closed watersheds
 pani main mili namak or anya padaarth in jhiilon yaa shushk kshetron main jaakar jamaa hoten rahete hai
 Hence the closed Jalasambhar lakes become very saline over time
 bharat ke rajasthan rajya main ajmer ke paas sthit sambar jhil thik aise hi band jalsambar kii ek khaari jhil he
 Pollution on such lakes also has a very bad effect because the pollutants continue to collect and grow instead of dispersing into the sea
 apni bhinn bhugolic or mausami paristhitiyon ke kaaran alag mahadwipon main band jalsambharon kii sankhya bhi bhinn he
 About 21% of Australia's area is closed watersheds, while in North America, closed watersheds cover only 5% of the area
 puure vishwa kaa lagbhag 18% jamini kshetrafal band jalsanbharon se grast he
 Closed watersheds with the largest area of the world are found in the interior of Asia
 kuch sookhe kshetron main band jalsambar kaa pani namak or anya lavan to le aata he, lekin garmi or shushkta ke kaaran tezi se vashpit hota rahata he
 At some places, the water flows only in one season or after flowing for some yoga, the geographical conditions change and stop coming
 aise shushk jhil vaale ilaaqon main namak kii moti or sakht parat jamkar ek vistrut samtal maidan bana detii he jo milon-koson tak failaa hota he
 Because such salt fields are perfectly flat and very large, they are used by fast trains to set a speed record
 kabhi-kabhi band jalsambharon kii jhiilon kaa aakaar mausam ke saath badalte pani ke bahaav ke saath-saath badalata rahata he
 These lakes shrink during the dry season and increase due to rains or snowfall
 kabhi-kabhi jab pani kam hota he to ek jhil kai choti jhiilon main bat jaati he or phir barishon ke baad pani badhane par milakar phir ek badi jhil ban jaati he
 If economic growth in an area is accompanied by water-resistant dams or canals for irrigation that reduce the flow of water into closed watershed lakes, these lakes often shrink and become very small
 aisi sthiti main un aabaadiyon par bahut karaab asar padataa he jo apane vyavsaay yaa jivan ke liye in jhiilon par nirbhar hon
 Something similar has happened with the Aral Sea in Central Asia

 There are many animation episodes of Pokémon that are slowly being removed in Japan or the rest of the world
 inamen se sabase kukhyat prakaran episod Electric Soldier Porygon tha
 This episode has made headlines around the world when it was realized that 685 children were kidnapped and due to this it was constantly in the headlines
 However, the sequence of attacks arose due to the actions of Pikachu whose episodes were portrayed as Pokémon, Porygon, seen in an animation movie Pokémon Heroes and later in Season 1, in a bumper scene, in addition to just a brief cameo

 However, some viewers were not happy as it was a separate Hindi dub
 ek nae dabing studio nai hindi dab banane ke liye shaamil kiya gaya tha, utivi software communications jo tha
 Thus a new voice cast was used along with a new translation
 kuch darshakon ko is bare main pareshaan the or hangaamaa tivi ko patr likhaa mul hindi dab phir se dikhaane ke liye
 The reason why a new Hindi dub was made is because: Cartoon Network and Hungama rival TV
 sound and vijan india hindi dab banaaya or cartoon network or pogo par prasaarit kiya gaya he
 They are customers with each other
 hangaamaa tivi unamem se ek nahin he
 Since they are owned by Disney UTV, a new Hindi had to be dubbed
 yadi in do channelon ek hi kaarykram hawa, vibhinn hindi dab sanskarnon kiya janaa he
 And also for another reason, due to licensing rights, a second Hindi dubbed to be done
 ek teesraa kaaran he, digni adhikaar mul hindi dab upyog karne ke liye nahin mil saktaa
 So it was dubbed in-house as part of their new policy that they had done since 2011
 jab videshi kaaryakramon par hawa hangaamaa tivi, ek nayaa hindi dab main ghar ke kiye jane kii jarurat
 Despite that though, both Hindi dubbed versions are based on the English adaptation as a reference for their own making

 US fda:link Paracetamol or acetaminophen is a widely used over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic drug

 In combination with steroid-free anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid analgesics, paracetamol is also used in the treatment of more severe pain
 opioid analgesic Although it is generally considered safe for human use in prescribed doses, doses higher than the prescribed amount of paracetamol can cause fatal liver damage, a normal dose in a person can be similarly harmful; This risk increases with consumption of alcohol
 pashchimi duniya main peracetamol kii vishalutaa liver kii ghaatak vifaltaa kaa sabase pramukh kaaran he or sanyukt rajya america, sanyukt raashtra, australia or newsolend main sabase zyada overdos isi dawa kii lee jaati he
 Paracetamol is derived from bitumen and is part of a class of drugs called "aniline analgesics"
 yah phenacetin kaa sakriy metabolismak he, jo kabhi khud ek analgesic or antipyretic ke rup main lokapriy tha, lekin phenacetin or iske sangyojan ke vipareet, peracetamol ko chikitsakeey khuraaq main carcinojanik nahin mana jaataa he
 Both the terms acetaminophen and paracetamol are derived from the chemical name of the same compound, which is the compound: pera-aceta ilaminophino l and pera-aceta ilami nofinol In some contexts, it is simply called APAP, abbreviated as N-acetyl
 -para is for aminophenol
 acetanilide pehla anilin vyutpann tha jisamen analgesic or antipyretic gun the or yah 1886 main bahut jaldi e
 kaahan or pi
 hep ke dwaara antifabrin ke naam se medical practice main aa gaya
 But its unacceptable toxic effects, particularly due to the risk of cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia, emphasized the discovery of a less toxic aniline derivative
 1877 main johns hopakins vishvavidhyalay main hormone northrope morse glacial acetic amla main tin ke saath "pi"-nitro phenol ke apchayan ke madhyam se pehle se hi peracetamol kaa sanshleshan kar chuke the
 But for the first time in 1887, the clinical pharmacologist Joseph von Mering tested paracetamol on patients
 1893 main, won mering ne ek patr prakashit kiya jisamen phenacetin or anya anilin vyutpann ke saath peracetamol ke naidanik parinaamon par report di gayi
 Von Mering claimed that, unlike phenacetin, paracetamol has a slight tendency to produce methemoglobinemia
 peracetamol ko jaldi hi phenacetin ke paksh main hataa diya gaya
 The sale of phenacetin established Bayer as a leading pharmaceutical company
 phenacetin par aspirin aanshik rup se baari thi, phenacetin 1899 main hinarich dreser ke dwaara aushadhi main aayi, phenacetin kai dashakon ke liye lokapriy rahi, vishesh rup se counter par beche jane vaale "sar dard ke mishran" jinka vyapak rup se vigyaapan kiya jaataa tha, main aam taur par phenacetin, ek aminopyrine vyutpann yaa aspirin, keffine or kabhi kabhi ek barbiturat hota tha
 Von Mering's claim could not be challenged for half a century when two teams of researchers from the United States analyzed the metabolisms of acetanilide and paracetamol
 1947 main david lester or leone greenberg ne is baat ke prabal pramaan praapt kiye ki peracetamol maanav ke rakt main acetanilide kaa ek mukhya metabolismak he or baad ke ek adhyayan main unhone report di ki albino chuhon ko peracetamol kii badi khuraaq dene par bhi methemoglobinemia utpann nahin hua
 In three papers published in the September 1948 issue of the Journal of Firmology and Experimental Therapeutics, Bernard Brodie Bernard Brody, Julius Axelrod Julius Axelrod and Frederick Flinn used more specific methods to ensure that paracetamol is the main metabolizer of acetanilide in human blood and It reported that it is an efficacious analgesic like its foregoing
 unhone yah bhi suzav diya ki methemoglobinemia kaa maanav main utpaadan mukhya rup se ek anya metabolismak phenlhydroxilemin ke dwaara hota he
 Subsequently in 1949, a letter by Brody and Axelrod stated that phenacetin also produces paracetamol via metabolism
 isse "ek baar phir peracetamol kii khoj" hui
 yah suzav diya gaya ki peracetamol kaa 4 -aminophenol se sankraman, ek padaarth jisase ise won mering ke dwaara sanshlisht kiya gaya, uske galat nishkarshon kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Paracetamol was first marketed in the United States in 1953 by the sterling-winthorp Company, which outperformed aspirin because it could be safely given to children and people with ulcers
 sanyukt rajya america main vartmaan main peracetamol ke liye sabase vikhyath brands, tylinole, kii sthapana 1955 main hui jab mekanil prayogshaala ne peracetamol ko bacchon ke liye dard or bukhaar main aaraam dene vaali dawa ke rup main bechnaa shuru kiya, iskaa brands naam tha Tylenol Children's Elixir— shabd "tylinole " para -acetyl aminophenol ke sankshiptikaran se praapt kiya gaya tha
 In 1956, 500 mg tablets of paracetamol began to be sold in the United Nations under the trade name Penadol, made by Friedrich Sterns and Company, a subsidiary of Sterling Drug Inc
 penadol mul rup se dard or bukhaar se raahat ke liye keval doctor kii salaah par hi uplabdh thi or iskaa prachaar "amashay ke liye hanirahit" hone ke rup main kiya ja rahaa tha, chunki us samay ke anya analgesic karkon main aspirin tha, jo amashay ko haani pahunchaata he
 In 1963, paracetamol became associated with British Pharmacopoeia and has since gained popularity as an analgesic factor with little side effects and very few reactions with other pharmaceutical factors
 peracetamol kii suraksha ke bare main uthe muddon ne isaki vyapak sweekruti ko 1970 tak asambhav banaaye rakhaa, lekin 1980 main sanyukt raashtra sahit kai deshon main peracetamol kii bikri aspirin se adhik ho gayi
 This led to the complete discontinuation of phenacetin commercially, as it was the cause of analgesic nephropathy and blood poisoning

 peracetamol main ek benzin valay kor hota he, jis par pera praturup main hydroxil samooh or ek amide samooh kaa nitrogen parmaanu pratisthaapan abhikriya ke dwaara lage hote hai
 The amide group is acetamide
 yah vyapak rup se ek sanyugmit pranali he, kyonki hydroxil oxigen par ek ayugmit yugma, benzin pai badal, nitrogen ayugmit yugma, carbonil carbon par p kaksh or carbonil oxigen par ayugmit yugma sabhi sanyugmit hote hai
 The presence of two activation groups also makes the benzene ring highly reactive for electron affectionate aromatic substitution
 chunki sabhi pratisthapi ortho, pera-nirdeshit hai or ek duusare ke saapeksh pera hai, valay par sabhi sthitiyaan kam yaa adhik samaan rup se sakriyat hai
 The conjugation greatly reduces the alkalinity of oxygen and nitrogen, while the hydroxyls are acidic through deuteration developed on phenoxide anions

 As a result, there is no need to design a stereo-selective synthesis

 penadol, jiskaa africa, asia, madhya america or australia main vipanan kiya jaataa he, sabase vyapak rup se uplabdh brands he jise 80 se adhik deshon main bechaa jaataa he
 In North America, paracetamol is sold commonly or by a trade name, for example tylenol, anacin-3, tempra, and detril
 Although brand-name paracetamol is available in the UK, non-brand common paracetamol is also commonly sold
 europe main, peracetamol ke sabase aam brands hai afferalgan or dolipren The most popular brand in Bangladesh is Napa which is manufactured by Beximco Pharma
 kuch sanyojanon main peracetamol opioidcodin ke saath hoti he, jise kabhi kabhi ko-kodamol kaha jaataa he
 In the United States and Canada, it is marketed under the name Tylenol # 1 / 2 / 3 / 4, which contains 8–10 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg codeine, respectively
 america main, yah sangyojan keval doctor kii salaah par hi miltaa he, jabaki sabase kam kshamta kaa sangyojan canada main counter par mil jaataa he or anya deshon main, anya kshamtaayen bhi counter par uplabdh ho sakati hai
 Common forms of these combinations are also available

 Other names are captin, dysprol, dimadone, phenam, Hedex, mexalene, nofedol, paralene, pediapirin, perfalgan, and solpadine
 Paracetamol is also combined with other opioids, such as dihydrocodeine, known as co-diadramol, oxycodone, or hydrocodone, and is marketed in the US as Percocet and Vicodin, respectively
 ek or bahut saamaanya rup se prayukt kiye jane vaale analgesic sangyojan main peracetamol ke saath propoxiphine nepcilette paaya jaataa he, jise darwoket naamak brands se bechaa jaataa he
 Paracetamol, a combination of codeine and the calamative doxylemin succinate, is sold under the name Syndol or Marsindol
 peracetamol kaa upyog migraine ke sirdard ke liye bahu ghatakon ke sangyojan ko banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, praroopik rup se isamen butalbital or peracetamol keffine ke saath aay keffine ke bina hote hai or kabhi kabhi isamen kodin bhi ho saktaa he
 Paracetamol is generally classified with non-steroidal regression medications, but is not considered one
 is varg kii sabhi dawaaon kii tarah, isaki mukhya kriya pranali cychlooxijinej kaa sandman he, yah ek anzime he jo prostaglandins ke utpaadan ke liye uttaradaayi he, jo sujan, dard or bukhaar ke mukhya madhyasth hai
 Therefore, all nsaids have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic properties
 prayek NSAID dawa kii vishisht abhikriya unke aushadhiy gunon, vitaran or metabolizam par nirbhar karti he
 While paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties compared to aspirin, it is unsuccessful in acting on anti-inflammatory actions, as paracetamol is sensitive to the high levels of paracicides present in inflammatory lesions
 baharhaal, jis karypranali se peracetamol bukhaar ore dard ko kam karti he, abhi bhi vyapak rup se ek bahes kaa vishay he kyonki peracetamol prostaglandins ke utpaadan ko kam karti he
 Aspirin also inhibits the production of prostaglandins, but in contrast to paracetamol it has a reduced anti-inflammatory action
 isi tarah, aspirin purv-skandan rasayan thromboksen ke utpaadan ko sandamit karti he, jabaki peracetamol aisa nahin karti he
 Aspirin is known to inhibit the cyclooxygenase class of enzymes and due to the partial similarity of paracetamol with aspirin action, there is more research on whether paracetamol also inhibits COX
 It is now clear that paracetamol acts through at least two pathways
 anzimon kaa COX varg ek asthaayee anu, prostaglendin H2 ke liye aracidonic amla ke metabolizam ke uttaradaayi he, yah anu asankhya anya purv shoth yogicon main badal jaataa he
 Classical anti-inflammatory, such as nsaids, block this position
 keval tabhi jab upyukt rup se oxikrut COX anzime bahut adhik sakriy hota he
 Paracetamol reduces the oxidized form of the COX enzyme, thus preventing it from forming pre-inflammatory chemicals
 
 is prakaar CNS main prostaglandin E2 kii maatra ko kam karke taap niamak centre main hypothelemus ke nirdhaarit bindu ko kam kar detaa he
 Inhibition of another enzyme COX3 is particularly affected in the case of paracetamol
 COX3 ko CNS anuchhed paath ke baahar nahin dekha gaya he
 Paracetamol also regulates the endogenous cannabinoid system
 peracetamol metabolizam ke dwaara AM404 banaati he, is yogic kii kai kriyaayein hai; sabase mahatvapurn he yah neuron ke dwaara antarjaat kenabinoid / veniloid enandamide ko sandamit karata he
 Which leads to activation of TRPV1, the main pain receptor of the body
 iske alaava, AM404 sodium channel kaa sandman karata he, jaisaa ki nishchetak lidoken or prokene karte hai
 It has been found that either of these actions reduces pain and may be a possible action mechanism of paracetamol, although it has been demonstrated that paracetamol analgesics, by inhibiting the cannabinoid receptor and inhibiting any activity of cannabinoids Loses the effect, it is said that its pain relieving action is mediated by the endogenous cannabinoid system
 ek siddhant ke anusaar peracetamol anzimon ke COX varg ke COX -3 isoform ko sandamit karne ke dwaara kaary karti he
 This enzyme, when acting in dogs, exhibits considerable similarity to other COX enzymes, forming pre-inflammatory chemicals and selectively inhibited by paracetamol
 haalanki, kuch shodh bataate hai ki manushyon or chuhon main, COX-3 anzime shoth kriya ke bina hota he
 Another possibility is that paracetamol inhibits cyclooxygenase, but it occurs in an environment of inflammation, where the concentration of peroxidase is high, the higher the oxidation state of paracetamol that inhibits its action
 iskaa arth yah hua ki peracetamol kaa shoth ke sthaan par koi pratyaksh prabhaav nahin hota he, lekin iske bajaay yah CNS main kaary karke taap aadi ko kam karata he jahaan vaataavaran oxikari nahin hota he
 The exact mechanism by which paracetamol is believed to affect COX-3 is disputed
 peracetamol kaa metabolizam prarambh main yakrut main hota he, jisase avishakt utpaada banate hai
 Three metabolic pathways are notable: hipetic cytochrome P450 anzime pranali peracetamol kaa metabolizam karti he or ek chota lekin mahatvapurn elkylicari metabolismak NAPQI banaati he
 NAPQI is now reversibly conjugated to the sulfhydryl group of glutathione
 in teenon margon se jo antim utpaada praapt hote hai, ve niskriy, avishakt hote hai or ant main vrikkon ke dwaara utsarjit kar die jate hai
 In the third pathway, however, the mediator product NAPQI is toxic
 NAPQI praathmik rup se peracetamol ke vifaille prabhaav ke liye uttaradaayi he; yah vishikaran kaa ek utkrisht udhaaharan he
 NAPQI is produced primarily by the two isoenzymes of cytochrome P450: CYP2E1 and CYP1A2
 However the P450 gene is highly polymorphic and individual differences in paracetamol toxicity are thought to be due to the third isoenzyme CYP2D6
 CYP2D6 main anuvanshik bahurupata NAPQI ke utpaadan kii kaaphi alag daron main yogadan kar sakati he
 In addition, individuals can be classified as "extensive", "ultrarapid" and "poor" metabolizers based on their CYP2D6 expression levels
 However, CYP2D6 is less of a metabolite of paracetamol than other P450 enzymes
 Makes NAPQI, its action contributes to the toxicity of paracetamol in extensive and ultrarapid metabolizers, when very high doses of paracetamol are taken
 saamaanya khuraaq lene par, NAPQI sanyugman ke dwaara jaldi hi nirvishikrut ho jaataa he
 After a high dose and possibly even in extensitive and ultrarapid metabolizers, this detoxification pathway becomes saturated and eventually NAPQI accumulates
 WHO kii salaah he ki peracetamol bacchon ko tabhi di jaani chahie jab bukhaar 38
5 °C se adhik ho
 101
3 °F) Paracetamol is a suitable alternative to aspirin, especially in patients with a high amount of gastric acid secretion or a prolonged bleeding time
 While paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties compared to aspirin, its anti-inflammatory effect is weaker
 chunki peracetamol ko aasaani se sahan kiya ja saktaa he, yah doctor ke parche ke bina bhi uplabdh ho jaati he, isse aspirin kii tarah gestric parshv prabhaav nahin hote hai, yah haal hi ke varshon main ek saamaanya gharelu dawa ban gayi he
 Unlike other common analgesics such as aspirin and ibuprofen, paracetamol has a significantly lower anti-inflammatory action, so it has not been considered a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
 tulanaatmak prabhavotpaadakta ke sambandh main, nsaids ke saath tulana karne par adhyayan paraspar virdohi parinaam darshaate hai
 a randomized controlled trial of chronic pain in osteoarthritis in adults found that paracetamol and ibuprofen are equally beneficial
 haalanki, bacchon main teevr kankal peshi ke dard ke ek yadrichhik niyantrit pareekshan main paaya gaya ki ibuprophen kii maanak khuraaq peracetamol kii maanak khuraaq kii tulana main adhik aaraam detii he
 In the stated amounts, paracetamol does not damage the stomach lining, affecting blood coagulation as much as nsaids or the functions of the kidney
 haalanki, kuch adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki ucch khuraaq kaa upyog ucch jathrantra sambandhi jatiltaaon jaise amashaayi raktasrav ke jokhim ko badhaata he
 Researchers found that excessive use of aspirin or paracetamol — 300 grams per year — was associated with a condition in which the kidney became small, serrated, and calcified
 peracetamol garbhavastha main surakshit he or nsaids kii tarah bhruneey ductus artiriosus ke band hone ko prabhavit nahin karti he
 Unlike aspirin, it is safe in children, as paracetamol is not associated with the risk of Reye's syndrome in children with viral disease
 nsaids kii tarah or opioid analgesic dawaaon ke vipareet, peracetamol kisi bhi tarah se utsaah yaa mood parivartan kaa kaaran nahin maani gayi he
 In 2008, the largest study of the long-term side effects of paracetamol in children was published in The Lancet
 31 deshon main 200,000 se adhik bacchon par kiye adhyayan main paaya gaya ki jivan ke pehle varsh main bukhaar ke liye peracetamol kaa upyog 6-7 saal kii aayu main asthma ke lakshanon ke badhane se sambandhit he or jivan ke pehle varsh ke saath 6-7 saal kii aayu main bhi peracetamol kaa upyog rhinokanjakativitis or eczema ke badhane se sambandhit he
 The authors acknowledge that their "discoveries can only be derived from indications", for example this relationship may not be common, but may also be caused by the disease being treated with paracetamol, and also stated that Further research is required in the subject
 iske alaava da lanset main asankhya sampadakeey, tippaniyan, patrachaar or unke jawaab prakashit kiye gaye jo is adhyayan ke nishkarsh or prakaar se sambandhit the
 Britain's regulatory body, The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, also reviewed this research and published several interpretations on these data and recommended parents, health professionals and other caregivers: "the new study The result does not necessitate any change in usage in the current guideline in children
 peracetamol bacchon main analgesic kaa ek surakshit or upyukt vikalp he
 This research provides insufficient evidence to change guidelines regarding the use of antipyretics in children

 In both organs, paracetamol poisoning is not due to the drug itself, but rather to a metabolic "n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone
" liver main, cytochrome P450 anzime CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 peracetamol ke NAPQI main roopantaran ke liye uttaradaayi he
 In the kidney, cyclooxygenases are the main pathways by which paracetamol is converted into NAPQI

 Empowering employees of a company or citizens of a community by participating in the decision making process of the organization is called participatory management
 audyogic sambandh ke do mahatvapurn pahalu hote he, sangharsh tathaa sahyog ke pahalu
 Modern industries continue to operate due to management and labor cooperation

 Due to which there is conflict between them
 prabandhak or prabandhiton ke kai hiton main virodh nahin hote, jisase ve paraspar sahyog karte rahete he
 Keeping these common interests in mind, several formal institutions of labor-management cooperation have been established, which regularly address common problems
 in sansthaao ko kai naam se pukara jaataa he; jaise-shram-prambdh sahyog, sanyukt paraamarsh, sah-nirdhaaran, sanyukt nirnayan, udyog main shramikon kii sahabhaagita, yaa prabandh main shramikon kii sahabhaagita
 Generally, all of the above terms are used in the same sense, but sometimes they try to differentiate based on specific forms, levels or amounts of participation
 prabandh main shramikon kii sahabhaagita ke kai uddeshy hote he, jinamein nimnlikhit mukhya hai- Increase in productivity is in the common interest of management and labor
 utpaadakta ke badhane se shramikon kii adhik mazdooree or vibhinn prakaar kii suvidha kii uplabdhi kii sambhaavna hoti he tathaa niojak ko adhik laabh kii prapti ho sakati he
 Labor-management cooperation can increase productivity or skills and improve the quality of goods produced
 isse barabaadi ko roken tathaa laagat kam karne main bhi sahaayta mil sakati he
 There may be differences between workers and managers or employers regarding the division of the fruits of increased productivity, but there is no conflict between them in relation to increasing or improving it
 jahaan utpaadakta-vruddhi ke fal ke vibhaajan kii samuchit vyavastha he, vahaan prabandh main shramikon kii sahabhaagita kii adhikansh yojanon main utpaadakta-vruddhi, yantron or mashiinon yaa samuchit upyog, barabaadi kii rokthaam, utpaadit vastuon kii gunvattta banaae rakhane, utpaadan-ghanto ke adhikadhik upyog, vinirmaan-prakriya tathaa kaary kii bhautik dashaa main sudhaar ko vishesh rup se sammilit kiya jaataa he
 In the opinion of many people it is necessary to provide opportunities for participation in the workers in determining the subjects with which they are directly related
 samuhik saudebaaji main shramik niojak par dabaav daalkar bahut kuch le lete hai, lekin isse unhen pratidin ke prabandh main bhaag len kaa niyamit avasar nahin miltaa
 Due to the development of collective bargaining, increase in the power of the labor unions and change in the tendency of the employers, emphasis is being laid on the formation of such organizations in which the representatives of the workers can sit jointly with the managers and take joint decisions
 isse shramikon ke bich pratishthan ke prati astha majboot hoti he or unhen prabandh main bhaag lete rahane kii santushti praapt hoti rahati he
 In socialist countries, special emphasis is given on encouraging labor participation in many areas of management
 aise kuch deshon main shramik udyog ke vibhinn staron par kai mahatvapurn vishyon par prabandhakon ke saath sanyukt nirnay lete he
 In this way, the participation of workers in management encourages the establishment of industrial democracy
 shram or prabandh ke bich sahyog se donon ek-duusare kii samasyaon or sthitiyon se acchhee tarah avgat hote hai or ve unke samaadhaan ke liye maitri ke vaataavaran main prayaas karte hai

 sanyukt nirnyon dwaara samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke anubhav se donon pakshakaar vivaadaaspad vishyon ke bhi hal nikaalane main safal hote hai
 Neither side opposes dissatisfaction with joint decisions, as they have also been active parties in them
 is tarah, prabandh main shramikon kii sahabhaagita se audyogic shanti banaae rakhane main prachur sahaayta milti he
 The schemes of the participation of workers in management provide abundant opportunities to the workers for self-expression and exchange of ideas
 unke vichaaron evam sujhaavon se sanghathan ke uddeshyon kii purti main sahaayta milti he tathaa prabandh bhi shramikon ke vikaas ke liye saamuchit avasar pradaan karata rahata he
 Due to the sympathetic tendency of management and the atmosphere of cooperation prevailing in the organization, the work efficiency of the workers also increases
 saath hi, shramik samajhate he ki in yojanaon ke madhyam se kaary-sthal par unke maanviya adhikaron par dhyaan diya ja rahaa hai or ve sakriy bhagidaar ke rup main sanghathan ke uddeshyon kii prapti main apana yogadan dete rahete hai
 With the participation of workers in the management, the management keeps getting useful suggestions of the workers in achieving the productive and other objectives of the organization
 in sujhaavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue prabandhak apni kaary-pranali evam utpaadan-prakriyaaon main sudhaar karte rahete hai
 Due to the implementation of participatory schemes, there are many examples of defective managerial activities and methods to be discarded and correct routes adopted
 is tarah, prabandhkeey kaushal main vruddhi hoti he or sanghathan k uddeshy sahajata se praapt hote he
 The level or quantity of participation of workers in management is not the same
 kahin sahabhaagita bahut hi simit hoti hai, to kahin shramik kai prabandhkeey kshetron main sakriy rup se bhaag lete hai
 On the basis of studies of the schemes of participation of workers in the management of different countries, scholars have mentioned different levels of participation
 in vidwaanon main alexander, mehtraj, raghavan, datta, tonic or adam sammilit hai
 Keeping in mind the implementation of the schemes of participation, the following levels or levels of participation of workers in management can be mentioned- sahabhaagita ke is str par niojak udhyam se sabanddh kuch vishesh kshetron jaise- vyavsaay kii dashaon, udhyam ke bhavishya, utpaadan-pranali main parivartan aadi ke sambandh main suchnaayen uplabdh karaane ke liye sahamat ho jate hai
 This level of participation is minimal
 suchanaatmak sahabhaagita se karmchaaree niojak kii sthiti se avgat ho jate he tathaa unhen dhyaan main rakhte hue apni maangon or sujhaavon ko prastut karte hai
 This helps the Shram Sangh to revise its policies and programs and bring changes in the attitude of the employees
 bharat main prabandh main shramika kii bhagidaari kii yojanaon ke antargat jin kshetron main karmchaariyon ko suchnaayen uplabdh karaane kii vyavastha kii gai he, uname mukhya he- udhyam kii saamaanya aarthik sthiti, udhyam kaa sanghathan or saamaanya sanchaalan, bazaar, vikray evam utpaadan kii sthiti, kaary evam vinirmaan ke tareeke, vaarshik tulan-patr tathaa vistaar evam pariniojan-yojanaayen
 At this level of participation, the employer consults the employees or the federation to resolve specific problems related to production or enterprise and seek their cooperation in this regard
 is str kii sahabhaagita saamanytah aavashyaktaa padane par vishesh samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye asthaayee rup se hoti he
 Based on experience, it can be broadened and permanent
 sanyukt rajya america ke vastra-udyog main is tarah kii sahabhaagita ke kai udhaaharan milte he
 In this level or quantity of participation, formal and regular consultation is arranged between the employer and the staff or labor union on many pre-determined common themes
 iske antargat niojak udhyam se sambhddha mahatvapurn vishyon par nirnay lene ke pehle karmchaariyon yaa shramsanghon se paraamarsh kar letaa he or unak drushtikonon ko dhyaan main rakhkar nirnay lene ke pehle karmchaariyon yaa shramsanghon niojak ko apane vichaaron se avgat karaate hai or apane suzav bhi dete he, lekin unhen sweekaar karne ke liye niojak ko baadhya nahin karte
 Consultative participation does not involve joint adjudication
 is str kii sahabhaagita se karmchaariyon or shramsangh kii paristhiti kaa nishchit manyata milti he
 In this level of participation, in some areas related to the enterprise, the administration is delegated to the joint committees of employees and managers
 sahabhaagita ke is str main karmchaariyon ko apekshaakrit adhik jimmedaari or adhikaar praapt hote hai tathaa unhen prashasan or nirikshan-sambandhi kaaryon main adhik swaittata praapt hoti he
 This is the highest level of participation of workers in management
 is str main nirnay kii prakriya vastav main sanyukt hoti he
 In this, both the management and the union of workers or workers have the opportunity to make decisions jointly and the consequences of the decisions are jointly on both
 adhikansh yojanaon main sanyukt-nirnayan ke kshetra purv-nirdhaarit rahete hai, lekin in kshetron kii vyapaktaa yaa vishyon main antar paaya jaataa he
 Representation of workers in the board of directors is also found to be an example of this level of participation or differences in subjects
 nideshak board m shramikon kaa pratinidhitiv bhi is str kii sahabhaagita kaa udhaaharan he
 Joint-decision areas are limited in India, but are widespread in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Yugoslavia, Poland and Japan
 kuch log samuhik saudebaaji ko bhi nirnayaatmak sahabhaagita ke rup main dekhaten hai
 However, the participation of workers in management and collective bargaining is not only differentiated on the basis of subject matter, but also in the form of both
 sahabhaagita mukhyatah ubhay hiton ke vishyon par hi hoti he, jabaki samuhik saudebaaji mukhyatahvirohi hiton par
 Cooperation on matters of common interest and improvement in production-growth or efficiency on the basis of goodwill and mutual trust in the participation of workers in management, but collective bargaining is based on the consequences that can arise from oppressive power to both parties

 In mathematical analysis, the Cicero compilation assigns a value to an infinite collection that does not converge in the usual sense, which coincides with the standard compilation if it is convergent

 The Sisera collection is named in honor of the Italian analyst Ernesto Sissera

 yah siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki abhisari shrenee sisera sankalneey hoti he or shrenee kaa kul yoga sisera sankalan ke samaan hota he
 However, the following example suggests that the range is divergent but Sisera is computable
 mana n ≥ 1 ke liye an = n+1 he
 That is, {an} is a sequence or mana g ek shrenee ∑ n = 1 ∞ a n = 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − ⋯ { \ displaystyle \ sum _{n=1}^{ \ infty }a_{n}=1-1+1-1+1- \ cdots } ko nirupit karata he
 Then the sequence of partial compilations {sn} = ∑ k = 1 nak { \ displaystyle = \ sum _ {k = 1} ^ {n} a_ {k}} will be is shrenee g ko grandi shrenee ke rup main janaa jaataa he jo abhisari nahin he
 In another form, the mean sequence of terms of {sn} is {tn} where nimna prakaar hai Therefore isliye shrenee g kaa sisera sankalan kaa maan 1 / 2 he
 In the other form, suppose n is an = n for ≥ 1
 arthath {an} ek anukram he
 And let g be a range ∑ n = 1 ∞ an = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ⋯ { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ { \ infty} a_ {n} = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + \ cdots} represents
