 From 1815 to 1979 it was the largest canton in Switzerland, but in 1979 the Jura separated from the canton and formed a new canton
 saral parisarp ek vishaanujanit rog he jo saral parisarp vishaanu 1 ) or saral parisarp vishaanu 2 ) donon ke kaaran hota he
 Infection with the herpes virus is classified as one of several specific disorders based on the site of infection
 maukhik parisarp, jiske dikhaai dene vaale lakshanon ko bolchaal kii bhashaa main sheethal ghaav kehete hai, chehre or munh ko sankramit kar dete he
 Oral herpes is the most common form of infection
 jananaangi parisarp, jise aamtaur par sirf parisarp ke rup main janaa jaataa he, parisarp kaa doosraa sabase saamaanya rup he
 Other disorders such as herpetic dysentery, herpes gladiatorum, herpes in the eye, herpes encephalitis due to herpes infection, molaritis, meningitis, herpes in newborns and possibly Bell's palsy are all caused by simple herpes virus
 parisarp ke vishaanu kisi vyakti ke rogagrast hone kii sthiti main apana prabhaav dikhaanaa shuru karte hai arthath ye rogagrast vyakti main chhaale ke rup main prakat hote hai jisamen sankramak vishaanu ke ansh hote hai jo 2 se 21 dinon tak prabhavi rahete hai or uske baad jab rogi kii haalat main sudhaar hone lagata he to ye ghaav gaayab ho jate hai
 Genital herpes, however, is often asymptomatic, although viral shedding may still occur
 aarambhik sankraman ke baad, vishaanu samvedi tantrikaon kii taraf badhate hai jahaan ve chirkaalik adrishy vishaanuon ke rup main nivas karte hai
 Reasons for recurrence are uncertain, however some possible causes have been identified
 samay ke saath, sakriy rog ke prakarnon kii aavriti or tivrata main kami aa jaati he
 Simple herpes spreads easily when an infected person is in direct contact with a wound or body fluid
 sparshonmukh bahaav ke samay ke dauraan twachaa se twachaa ke sampark ke madhyam se bhi sancharan ho saktaa he
 Barrier protection methods are the most reliable methods of preventing the transmission of herpes, but they reduce risk rather than just eliminate them
 maukhik parisarp kii aasaani se pahchaan ho jaati he yadi rogi ke ghaav yaa ulcer dikhaai dene yogya ho
 The early stages of orofacial herpes and genital herpes are somewhat difficult to detect; This usually requires laboratory testing
 america kii jansankhya kaa bees pratishat ke paas echesavi-2 kaa rog-pratikaarak hai haalanki un sab kaa jananaangi ghaavon kaa itihaas nahin he
 There is no cure for herpes
 ek baar sankramit hone jane ke baad vishaanu jivan paryant sharir main rahata he
 However, after many years, some people will become asymptomatic forever and will never experience any type of outbreak but they can still be contagious to others
 iske tikon kaa rog-vishyak pareekshan chal rahaa he lekin prabhaavshaalee sabit nahin hue hai
 Viral reproduction and shedding can be reduced through treatment, preventing the virus from entering the skin, and reducing the severity of symptomatic episodes
 saral parisarp ke sambandh main un halaaton ke saath bhramit nahin hona chahie jo parisarpavyrida parivaar jaise parisarp zoster main anya vishaanuon ke kaaran hote hai jo choti mata yaa chechak ke zoster vishaanu ke kaaran hone vaala ek vishaanujanit rog he
 There is also a possibility of getting confused with "hand, foot and mouth disease" due to the appearance of lesions on the skin
 echesavi sankraman ke kaaran kai vishisht chikitsiya vikaar hote hai
 Common infections of the skin or mucosa can affect the face and mouth, genitals, or hands

 HSV infection is also associated with cognitive deprivation of bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease, although it often depends on the genetics of the infected person
 echesavi-2 ke saath ek daihik sankraman kii ek hi aisi report he jiske anusaar ek swasth pratiraksha tantra vaali ek swasth 28-varshiya vruddh mahila, vishaanu ke pravesh karne ke 12 dinon baad mar gai

 praathmik sankraman ke baad, vishaanu praathmik sankraman ke sthal kii nason main pravesh karata he, tantrikakoshika ke koshika-pind main chalaa jaataa he or gandika main jaakar lupt ho jaataa he
 As a result of the primary infection, the body then produces antibodies to the particular type of HSV involved by preventing that type of infection occurring at another site

 In another study, HSV-1 DNA was not found to be present in the cerebrospinal fluid of people suffering from Bell's palsy, which gave rise to the question of whether HSV-1 is a putative agent in this type of facial paralysis
 The potential effect of HSV-1 in the etiology of Bell's palsy has encouraged the use of antiviral therapy to treat the condition
 aisiclovir or vailcyclovir ke laabhon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he
 But even when fully identifiable, the effect seems to be minimal
 vaigyanikon ne 1979 main echesavi-1 or alzimer rog ke bich ek kadi kii khoj kii
 In the presence of a specific gene-related variation (epsilon 4 allele carrier), HSV-1 appears to specifically damage the nervous system and increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in an individual
 vishaanu lipo proteinon ke ghatakon or abhigrahakon se sampark karte hai, jo alzimer rog ke vikaas main madad karata he
 Without the presence of the gene allele, HSV type 1 does not cause any damage in the veins and thus increases the risk of Alzheimer's
 da jarnal of pathology main prakashit ek adhyayan se beta-amilloid plaqon ke bheetar saral parisarp ke vishaanu tip 1 ke diene ke ek marmbhedi sthaniyakaran se pataa chalaa he jo alzimer rog ko parilakshyit karata he
 This suggests that it is a major cause of viral plaques and therefore probably an important etiological factor of Alzheimer's disease
 parisarp ek sankramit vyakti ke kisi sakriy ghaav yaa sharir ke taral padaarth ke sidhe sampark main aane se failata he
 Herpes transmission occurs between incompatible partners; a person with a history of infection (seropositive) can transfer the virus to an HSV seronegative person
 saral parisarp ke vishaanu 2 ko praapt karne kaa ekmaatr tarika ek sankramit vyakti ke pratyaksh twachaa-se-twachaa sampark kaa madhyam he
 To infect a new person, HSV passes through small pores in the skin or mucous membranes of the mouth or genital areas
 yahaan tak ki shlesh jhilliyon kaa sookshmdarsheey kharonch bhi vishaanuon ke pravesh karne ke liye paryaapt he
 HSV asymptomatic shedding sometimes occurs in most individuals infected with herpes
 50 fisadi maamalon main ek sparshonmukh punrariti ke ek saptaah se adhik yaa baad yah ho saktaa he
 Infected people who have no visible symptoms can still shed or transmit the virus through their skin; Asymptomatic shedding may exhibit the most common type of HSV-2 transmission
 sparshonmukh bahaav echesavi praapt karne pratham 12 maheenon ke bheetar kai baar hota he
 Concurrent infection of HIV increases the frequency and duration of asymptomatic shedding
 aise sanket mili hai ki kuch logon main is tarah kaa bahut kam bahaav ho saktaa he, lekin sabooton se pataa chalata he ki iskaa puri tarah se satyaapan nahin kiya gaya he; sparshonmukh bahaav kii aavriti main kisi prakaar kii koi vibhinnata ko nahin dekha gaya he jab saale main baarah baar punraritiyon vaale logon kii tulana un logon se kii jaati he jinamein koi punrariti nahin hui he
 Antibodies that develop a type of HSV after the initial infection prevent re-infection from the same type of virus - a person with a history of orofacial infection caused by HSV-1 caused by HSV-1
 Herpes cannot elicit infection of genital or genital infections
 ek monogemas yugal main, ek seronegative mahila main ek seropusitive purush saathi kii tulana main echesavi sankraman ke praapt karne kaa prati varsh 30% se bhi adhik jokhim hota he
 If an oral HSV-1 infection is first received, seroconversion may have occurred 6 weeks later to provide protective antibodies against a future genital HSV-1 infection
 praathmik orophacial parisarp kii tatkaal pahchaan un vyaktiyon ke rog-vishyak pariksha ke madhyam se kii jaati he jinhen kabhi ghaav nahin hua he or jo kabhi gyaat echesavi-1 sankraman vaale kisi vyakti ke sampark main aayaa he
 In these people, the appearance and distribution of lesions usually occur in the form of multiple, round, superficial oral ulcers, accompanied by acute inflammation of the gums
 jin vyask vyaktiyon main yah aam rup saamne nahin aata he unke rogon kii pahchaan kar paanaa zyada mushkil hota he
 Pre-symptoms that appear before Dada lesions help differentiate HSV symptoms into other disorders that look similar to other disorders, such as allergic stomatitis
 jab munh main ghaav nazar nahin aate hai, to praathmik orophacial parisarp ko kabhi-kabhi impatigo samajhane kii bhul ho jaati he jo ki jeevanuon se hone vaala ek sankraman he
 Common lesions in the mouth also resemble intramuscular herpes, but there is no vesicular phase present

 Apart from this, there are many other conditions like genital herpes which include lichen planus, atopic dermatitis and urethritis due to confusion in the diagnosis of the disease
 jananaangi parisarp kii pahchaan kii pushti karne ke liye aksar prayogshaala pareekshan kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Laboratory tests include: enrichment of the virus, studies of direct fluorescent antibodies to detect the virus), skin biopsies and polymerase chain reactions to test for the presence of viral DNA)
 Although the diagnostic tests performed by these procedures are much more sensitive and specialized, the high cost and time constraints of these procedures discourage the regular use of clinical treatments
 echesavi main antibody ke sirmiya pareekshan shaayad hi kabhi upyogi sabit hote hai or rog-vishyak prayaas main inkaa niyamit rup se istemaal nahin kiya jaataa he lekin ye mahamari vigyaan ke adhyayanon main mahatvapurn hote hai

 Condoms provide general protection against HSV-2 in both men and women, as well as users who continue to use condoms have a 30% lower risk of acquiring HSV-2 than those who do not use condoms
 vishaanu letex condom se hokar nahin guzar saktaa he lekin phir bhi condom kii prabhaavashiltaa simit hoti he kyonki yah un sabhi kshetron ke saath hone vaale twachaa sampark yaa shaareerik taur par taral padaarth ke sampark se bachaav nahin karata he jo andkosh kii thili, guda, kulhon, upree jaanghon yaa ling ke bilkul aasapaas ke kshetra hai, jinamein se sabhi kshetron main vishaanu kaa sankraman yaa sancharan kii teevr sambhaavna he
 In addition to wearing a condom, theoretically better protection against herpes should be provided through the prevention of contact with these areas during sexual contact
 jo kapade yaa jaanghia jaise boxr shorts in atisamvedansheel kshetron ko dhankate hai lekin phir bhi ek chote se ched ke madhyam se jananaangon main ghuspaith main madad karata he, unhen sancharan or sankraman kii rokthaam karnaa chahie
 The use of condoms or dental dams also limits the transmission of herpes from the genitals to one partner during oral sex
 jab ek saathi ko saral parisarp sankraman ho or duusare saathi ko na ho, to condom ke saath vishaanu-virdohi chikitsa, jaise - vailcyclovir kaa upyog asankramit saathi main sancharan kii sambhaavna ko or kam kar detaa he
 Topical microbicides that contain chemical elements that directly inactivate the virus and prevent viral entry are being investigated

 On an annual basis, the risk of transmission of HSV-2 from infected male to female without antiviral or condom use is about 8–10%
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah sambhavit sankraman sthalon main shleshmal uttak ke bade hue khulepan kii vajah se hota he
 The risk of transmission from infected woman to man is about 4-5% per year
 damanaatmak vishaanu-virdohi chikitsa in jokhimon ko 50% tak kam kar detaa he
 Antiviral elements also help prevent up to 50% of the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios - which means that the infected partner will not only be seropositive but also symptom-free
 condom kaa prayog bhi sancharan kaa jokhim 50% tak kam karata he
 Condom use is much more effective in preventing transmission from male to female than vice versa

 The seronegative mother who currently receives HSV has a 57 percent chance of transmitting the infection to her baby during childbirth, as there will be insufficient time to bring and transfer protective maternal antibodies before the baby is born, while a woman who is Is seropositive for both HSV-1 and HSV-2, in which the probability of transmission of infection in your baby is around 1 to 3% it happens
 echesavi-2 kii tarah maukhik sex dwaara sancharit hone vaala echesavi-1 bahut zyada aam nahin he lekin isamen hameshaa jokhim hota he
 For women who are seropositive for only one type of HSV, the likelihood of transmission of HSV is only half that of infected seronegative mothers

 There are several antiviral medications given in consultation with a doctor to control the outbreak of simple herpes, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir and peniclovir
 Acyclovir is an original and morphological member of this drug category; It is now available in generic brands at very low prices
 vailcyclovir or famcyclovir—jo kramshah aisiclovir or penciclovir ke prodrag hai—kii jal main sanshodhit ghulanshiltaa or behatar jaev-uplabdhta hoti he jab maukhik rup se liya jaataa he

 Valaciclovir and famciclovir use are still undergoing safety assessment in this context, while potentially improving treatment compliance and efficacy
 manushyon or chuhon par kiye gaye kai adhyayan is baat ke saboot he ki parisarp ke pratham sankraman ke turant baad famcyclovir kii sahaayta se shuru main kiya gaya upachaar parisarp ke bhavi prakopon kii sambhaavna ko mahatvapurn dhang se kam kar saktaa he
 Early use of famciclovir has been proven to reduce the amount of latent virus in the neurological ganglia
 manushyon main parisarp ke pehle maamle ke dauraan roj din main teen baar karke paanch dinon tak famcyclovir kii 250 milligram kaa prayog karke unki samiksha karne par paaya gaya ki pehle prakope ke baad chah maheenon ke bheetar keval 4
2 pratishat logon main hi isaki punrariti hui jo aisiclovir kii sahaayta se upachaar kiye gaye rogiyon main hone vaale 19 pratishat punrariti kii tulana main paanch guna kam tha
 Despite these promising results, initial famciclovir treatment for herpes in this or similar dosage regime is still to be predominantly adopted
 natijatan, kuch doctoron or rogiyon ne of-label upyog kaa vikalp chunaa he
 a proposed regimen should provide a dose of 10 to 20 mg / kg of famciclovir per day for 5 to 10 days and simultaneously begin treatment as soon as possible after the first infection of herpes and the first infection of the herpes
 Starting treatment within five or less days proves to be very effective
 haalanki, is upachaar ke avasar kii khidki vishaanu ke pratham sankraman ke baad keval kuch maheenon ke liye hi khuli rahati he, jiske baad adrishyata ke falswaroop sambhavit prabhaav shunya main badal jaataa he
 Antiviral medications are also available as topical creams for the treatment of recurrent outbreaks on the lips, although their effectiveness is debated
 aciclovir kriim kii apeksha penciclovir kriim kaa koshika ke ardh-jivan par 7 se 17 ghante tak adhik asar rahata he or samayik taur par ise lagane par aciclovir kii tulana main iskaa asar bad jaataa he

 There is insufficient scientific and clinical evidence to support the effective use of most of these compounds for the treatment of herpes in humans
 lycin anupuran, prophilaxis or saral parisarp ke upachaar ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Lysine exhibits very high efficacy against HSV-1 but may not be active against all different forms of the virus

 Herpes was not known to be a virus until the 1940s

 Its original use was usually against malignant or incapacitating diseases, such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, diseases in immunocompromised patients, or disseminated herpes zoster

 The use was expanded to include simple herpes, zoster and topical treatment of varicella
 kuch pareekshanon ne bhinn-bhinn parinaamon ke saath alag-alag vishaanu-virdohi tatwon ko sanyukt kiya
 The introduction of 9-β-d-arabinofuranosolidine, AKA ara-a or vidarabine, which is significantly less toxic than ara-c, in the mid-1970s paved the way for the introduction of routine neonatal antiviral treatment
 widarabin, echesavi ke khilaaf karrwai vaali vyavasthit rup se di jane vaali pehali vishaanu-virdohi dawa thi jiske liye chikitsa-sambandhi kshamta ne jivan ke liye khatra paidaa karne vaale echesavi rog ke prabandhan ke liye vishaaktata ko badha diya

 Widevarabin's low toxicity and ease of use have made acyclovir the preferred drug for the treatment of herpes after being licensed by the FDA in 1998

 On the other side of the equation, acyclovir appears to inhibit the antibody response, and newborns receiving acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a relatively small increase in antibody titer compared to vidarabine

 parisarp ke vishaanu se sankramit log mitron or parivaar sahit anya logon ke samaksh prastut hone main aksar kataraate rahe hai kyonki ve sankramit hai

 The vaccine has been shown to be effective only for women who have never encountered HSV-1

 During the initial trials, the vaccine did not demonstrate any evidence of inhibiting HSV-2 in men

 Most importantly, a successful effort was made by Professor David Knipp, Higgins Professor of Microbiology at Harvard Medical School
 unki prayogshaala ne diel5-29 naamak ek pratikruti-doshapurn utparivarti vishaanu ko viksit kiya jo pashu modelon main hone vaale echesavi-2 / echesavi-1, donon prakaar ke sankramanon kii rokthaam karne main or pehle se hi sankramit mejabaanon main vishaanu kaa mukaable karne main safal sabit hua he
 In particular, Knipp's laboratory has already demonstrated that replication-defective vaccines induce strong and specific antibodies to HSV-2 and T-cell responses; HSV-2 protects against intractable-type challenge of the virus; Reduces the severity of recurrent disease to a great extent; Provides adverse-protection against HSV-1 and deduces viruses that are unable to return to a virulent state or disappear
 unke tike par acambis dwaara shodh kiya ja rahaa he or use viksit kiya ja rahaa he or 2009 main ise ek anusandhanatmak nai dawa ke rup main prayog kiya janaa baaki he
 Another possibility is the elimination of a variant of HSV-1 by Professor Brian Cullen and his team at Duke University

 a class of drugs, called antagomir, could serve this purpose
 ye rasinic taur par yojana ke tahat nirmit arene ke oligonucliotids yaa chote-chote khand hai, jinhen apane lakshya anuvanshik saamagree, arthath parisarp microarene ko prativimbit karne ke liye banaaya ja saktaa he
 These could be produced under the scheme, by introducing the virus unable to remain invisible in its host, to engage the micrornas and thus 'silence' them
 professor kulen kaa maananaa he ki microarene ko baadhit karne ke liye ek dawa viksit kii ja sakati thi jiskaa kaam adrishyata kii sthiti main rahane vaale echesavi-1 kaa daman karnaa ho
 Additionally, another solution can be explored regarding the treatment of infection
 bavituximeb naamak ek cross vishaanu-virdohi dawa vibhinn aawarit vishaanuon se sankramit chuhon or gini ke siiron ke prabhavi dhang se upachaar karne main pehle hi safal sabit ho chukaa he
 Herpes viruses fall into this category and it is believed that the virus could be eradicated with the use of this drug

 generik dawaaiyon kaa naam usamen upasthit sakriy yogic ke naam ke aadhaar par ek visheshgy samiti nirdhaarit karti he
 The generic name of any medicine is the same all over the world
 generik dawa bina kisi patent ke banaai or vitarit kii jaati hai yani generik dawa ke formulation par patent ho saktaa he kintu uski saamagree par patent nahin ho saktaa
 The quality of generic medicines made by international standards is no less than that of branded medicines, which are also supplied worldwide and have the same effect as branded medicines
 unki dose, said- effect, saamagree aadi sabhi branded dawaaon ke ekadam samaan hoti hai
 For example, for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men, there is a generic drug called Sildenfil which is sold by the Pfizer company Viagra

 isi sault kii generik dawa kii 10 goliyon kaa patta sirf 59 rupee main hi uplabdh he, yani isaki ek goli kareeb 6 rupee main hi padegi
 The special thing is that in the diseases like kidney, urin, burn, heart disease, neurology, diabetes, there is a huge difference in the price of branded and generic medicine
 dawa companiyaan branded dawa se bada munafa kamaati hai
 Drug companies, through their medical representations, give huge benefits to doctors for prescribing their branded medicines
 isi aadhaar par doctoron ke najdiki medical store ko dawa kii aapurti hoti he
 This is the reason why the business of branded medicines is increasing day by day
 yahi vajah he ki doctor generik dawa likhte hi nahin hai
 On getting the information, if any person also asks for the generic medicine from the chemist's shop, then the drug dealers refuse their availability
 desh ke zyaadaatar bade shaharon main eksclusive generik medical store hote hai, lekin inkaa vyapak prachaar nahin hone se logon ko inkaa phayda nahin miltaa aajkal har prakaar kii jaankaree internet ke jariye aasaani se hasil kii ja sakati he

 According to the World Health Organization, on the prescription of generic medicines, only in the rich countries the medical expenditure will be reduced by 70 percent and the reduction in the medical expenditure of the poor countries will be even more
 generik dawaaen utpaadak se sidhe retailor tak pahunchati hai
 Companies do not have to spend anything on the promotion of these drugs
 ek hi company kii patent or generik dawaaon ke mulya main kaaphi antar hota he
 Since there is a government control on the pricing of generic drugs, they are cheaper, while the price of patent medicines is decided by the companies themselves, so they are expensive

 By then, the practice of collecting artistic objects in London had begun to go in full swing
 falat: france se anek bahoomoolya tathaa utkrisht kalakritiyaan landan tathaa europe ke bazaaron main bikne lagi thim
 To prevent this, the Government of France planned a State Museum and Chitrashala to preserve the country's unique artifacts as national funds

 But when the National Museum started to be built, then the attention of the people also went to classify all the artistic material from the historical, cultural and social point of view, so that their spontaneous development could be known
 vienna main kalatmak samagriyon ke nirdeshak chrishchiyan vaan michel ne rashtriya sangrahalay ko sarvapratham isi dhang par sajaayaa or yah paripati chal padi

 sanghavaad sanvaidhanik rajsanchalan kii us pravriti kaa praaroop he jiske antargat vibhinn rajya ek sanvida dwaara ek sangh kii sthapana karte hai
 According to this contract, a federal government and several state governments become different units of the union
 saamaanya rup se prabhusatta kaa vibhaajan sangheey evam rajyasarkaron ke madhya unke samvidhan main ullikhit hota he jo us sanvida ko antim rup se pusht karata he
 Generally, the federal government is given the responsibility of conducting such tasks which the states find themselves difficult to run due to their being expensive or difficult to expand
 at: in kaaryon ke chalaane ke liye ve sab ikaiyaan prathit karte hai
 Therefore, to run these functions, all those units give a certain portion of their powers to the federal government as a right and means
 shesh anya vishyon main rajya swayan kaarybhaar vahan karte hai evam uske praturup adhikaar evam saadhan ke rup main pradaan kar dete hai
 In other remaining subjects, the states themselves bear the charge and the constitution takes its rights and means by the Constitution
 is prakaar ekaatmak samvidhan ke vipareet sanghatmak samvidhan ek hi samvidhan ke antargat rajdvai ko sthapana karata he
 As a result, the citizens of such a union are subordinate to two types of governments, the federal and state governments
 sanghatmak samvidhan main nimnlikhit visheshtaayen apekshit hoti hai : An ideal draft of a federal constitution with these characteristics is the United States Constitution, which was created in 1787 according to the contract of 12 independent nations
 iske pashchaat canada, austrailia, germany evam france ityadi ke sanghatmak samvidhanon kaa nirmaan hua
 The Constitution of India, which came into force since 1950, is a new example of federal constitutions
 pradhanat: bharat ke samvidhan main sanghatmak samvidhan kii sabhi uparyukt visheshtaayen vidyaman hai
 But there are some specific provisions in the Indian federal constitution which have been incorporated keeping in view the difficulties arising out of the functioning of other constitutions
 udaahranarth, sabase vishisht tathy yah he ki bhartiya samvidhan sanghatmak hote hue bhi iskaa nirmaan swatantra rashtron kii kisi sanvida dwaara nahin hua he; balki yah un raaj ikaayiyon ke mail se bana he jo parantantr ekaatmak bharat ke ang ke rup main pehle se hi vidyaman the
 The second feature is that in the Emergency, the Indian Constitution contained provisions to make the center more powerful as per unitary constitutions
 tritiy visheshta yah he ki keval ek naagarikta kaa hi samavesh kiya gaya he tathaa ek hi samvidhan centre tathaa rajya donon hi sarkaron ke kaarysanchalan ke liye vyavasthaayen pradaan karata he
 Apart from this, according to the Constituent Assembly, India is in the state of an infant republic, so for the rapid and all-round development and progress of the country, suitable provisions may be required from time to time, for which three different procedures for constitution amendment have been given
 keval vishesh sanghatmak praavdhaanon ke sanshodhan ke liye hi rajyon kaa mat aavashyak he, baaki sanshodhan sansad swayan kar sakati he
 Thus the Indian Constitution ushers in a new trend, centralization, in the development of federal constitutions

 Optics is that part of geometric optics that studies the movement of light by treating it as a 'ray'
 isaliye ise 'kiran prakaashiki' bhi kehete hai
 According to the belief of ray optics, as long as light moves in a homogeneous medium, its path is in a straight line
 jahaan par do madhyam milte hai, vahaan prakaash kirne mud jaati hai In fact, to a large extent simplification of optics is geometric optics
 jyamitiya prakaashiki ke antargat prakaash ke vivartan or vyatikaran kii koi vyakhya nahin di ja sakati
 But geometrical optics is capable of producing images and explaining optical contrast
 duusare shabdon main, jyamitiya prakaashiki ke dwaara parinaam tab tak shuddh aate hai jab tak vastuon kaa aakaar prakaash ke tarangadairghy kii tulana main kaaphi bada ho
 Geometric optics is the part of optics in which the geometry of light rays and the process of reflection-formation through optical systems is studied
 isamen prakaashiya upkarnon ke gunon tathaa un lens|lenson]], darpanon evam samparshwo kaa vivaran sannihit hota he jinke dwaara prakaashiya upkarnon kii rachana hoti he
 It is a known fact that rays of light move in a straight line
 unke is gun ko prakaash kaa rujurekhiy sancharan kehete hai
 The substance through which rays of light pass through is called 'medium'
 jab prakaash kii kirane kisi madhyam se chalakar duusare madhyam main pahunchati hai to teen kriyaayein hoti hai : Some, or more, portion of the rays of light are returned to the medium before the dividing plane of both mediums
 is kriya kaa paravartan kehete hai
 Some part of the rays of light are absorbed at the separator plane
 or The remaining part of the rays of light move to another medium
 is kriya ko apvartan kehete hai
 Geometric optics is based on some simple assumptions
 ve hai - Rays of light move in a simple line in a medium
 prakaash kirnon ke swatantra vitaran kaa niyam Law of reflection apvartan kaa niyam The law of evolution of the light beam - According to this, the motion of a light beam is considered to be moving in the opposite direction of its forward movement
 paravartan or apvartan prakriya ke samay prakaash kii kirane kuch niyamon kaa paalan karti hai
 The following is the rule of reflection: 1
 apati kiran, vibhaajak tal main aapatan bindu par daalaa gaya abhilamb evam paravartit kiran, teenon ek hi tal main sthit hote hai The incidental and reflected rays lie opposite to the normal and aapatan evam paravartan kone paraspar baraabar hote hai
 <i = <r apvartan sambandhi niyam nimnlikhit hai : 1
 The incident ray, the normal and refracted rays inserted at the incident point in the dividing plane, all three are located in the same plane
 2
 apati evam apavartit kirane abhilamb ke paraspar vipareet ore sthit hoti hai
 And aapatan evam apvartan konon kii jyaaon main ek sthir anupaat hota he
 This ratio is expressed by the Greek letter mu and is called the refractive index of the second medium relative to the first medium
 == prism se apvartan == Bharatkosh Quran Bharatkosh Editorial Calendar Quiz Full Internal Reflection Full Internal Reflection Full Internal Reflection is a optical phenomenon
 prakaash hameshaa hi ek madhyam se prakaashiya rup se saghan madhyam main ja saktaa he, lekin yah viral madhyam main hameshaa nahin ja saktaa
 When light rays are incident on the surface of the sparse medium and the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, the light does not refract, but the entire light is reflected and returned to the same medium
 is ghatana ko 'purna aantarik paravartan' kehete hai
 Optical fiber is a useful use of full internal reflection
 prakaashiya tantuon kaa kaary purna aantarik paravartan ke siddhanth par hi aadhaarit he
 Generally the refractory plane of the optical instruments being treated are the rotating planes, whose symmetric axis is common
 is samamiti se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki aksh par sthit prayek bindu kaa bimb aksh par hi sthit kisi duusare bindu par banataa he
 In other words it can be said that the entire axis is its own object
 kisi apvartak tantra ke aksh par ek aisa bindu hota he jisase nikalanevaali prakaash kii kirane apvartak tantra ke baahar aksh ke samaantar nikalati hai or is prakaar us bindu kaa bimb anant par banataa he
 That point is called the first focus point of the refractive system
 pratham focus bindu se hokar aksh ke samakonik khinchaa hua mana gaya tal pratham focus tal kaha jaataa he
 The rays moving from a point on this plane become parallel after refraction
 dwitiya focus bindu apvartak tantra ke aksh par sthit vah bindu he jisapar anant se aksh ke samaantar aanevaali sabhi kirane abhisarit hoti hai, arthath jis bindu par, anant par sthit vastu kaa bimb banataa he
 From this point, the hypothetical plane of the axis is called the second focus plane
 kisi lens ke pratham focus bindu se apsaarit honevaali kirnon kaa shanku lens ke donon dharaatalon par vichlit hota he
 On increasing the incident rays forward and the output rays backwards, the points of passage are located on the common plane, called the first principal plane of the lens
 lens ke do dharaatalon par do baar vichlan, mukhya samtal par kiran ke ek hi baar vichlan ke tulya hota he
 Similarly, the rays coming parallel to the axis of the lens, after refraction, lead to the second focus point
 yadi apati kirnon ko aage kii ore tathaa apavartit kirnon ko peeche kii ore badhaayaa jaay to unke pariched bindu ek samtal par sthit honge, jise dwitiya mukhya samtal kehete hai
 The points along the axis of these planes are called the first and second principal points respectively
 pratham focus duuri tathaa dwitiya mukhya bindu se dwitiya focus bindu kii duuri ko dwitiya focus duuri kehete hai
 Many things have to be kept in mind in the construction of optical instruments, especially that all the rays coming from a pointwise object are collected on a pointwise object, that is, they are free from the defect of aberration
 is hetu yah aavashyak he ki bimb main goleey tathaa varni vipathan na hone paaen, anyathaa bimb vikrut hoga or ek sthaan par banane ke bajaay bhinn bhinn rangon ke kai bimb ban jaayenge
 One has to find a characteristic function to diagnose these problems
 kisi vastu se chalakar apvartak tal par pahunchnewali sabhi kirnon dwaara bananevaale bimb kaa vivechan karne par hamen pataa chalata he ki vah bimb kshetravakrata tathaa vikruti aadi dosha se yukt rahata he
 Therefore Gauss suggested limiting the idea to only those rays which move very close to the axis of the refractive system
