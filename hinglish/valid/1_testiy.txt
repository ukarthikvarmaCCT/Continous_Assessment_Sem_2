 When mcgee used the term at the International Geological Conference of 1891, it became common usage in English, German and French
 ek aarambhik lokapriy bhu-akritik model bhugolic chakra yaa kataav kaa chakra tha jise 1884 or 1899 ke bich wiliam morris davis dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha
 This cycle was inspired by the principles of homogeneity that James Hutton first proposed
 ghati jaisi akritiyon ke sambandh main, ekarupathavaad ne is chakra ko aise anukram main chitrit kiya jisamen ek nadi kisi ghati ko adhik se adhik gaharaa katati he, lekin phir paksh ghaatiyon kaa kataav us ilaake ko antat punah samtal kar detaa he or oonchai ko kam kar detaa he, jiske baad utthan us chakra ko phir se shuru kar saktaa he
 Decades after Davis developed his theory, many studies of geomorphology attempted to fit his ideas into this mold for landscape development on a large scale, and are often referred to today as "davisian"
 davis ke vichaaron ko kaaphi had tak aaj paar kar liya gaya he, mukhya rup se unamem purvanumaan kshamta or gunatmak prakruti kii kami kii vajah se, lekin ve is vishay ke itihaas main ek atyant mahatvapurn vyakti bane hue hai
 In the 1920s, Walter Pank developed an alternative model to Davis's model, assuming that topographic evolution could be better defined as a balance between continuous processes of uplift and denudation, not Davis's single uplift
 As decay occurring after
 haalanki, apekshaakrit yuvavastha main hi uski asamyik mrityu kii vajah se, davis ke saath vivaad or unke kaaryon ke angreji anuwaad kii kami se unke vichaaron ko kai varshon tak vyapak manyata nahin mili
 These authors attempted to give the study of the evolution of the Earth's surface a more generalized, globally relevant basis than before
 19veen sadi ke aarmabhik kaal main, lekhakon ne - vishesh rup se europe main - bhu-akritiyon ke liye sthaneey jalwaayu ko shrey diya or vishesh rup se himachhadan or perigleshial prakriyaaon ko
 In contrast, Davis and Pank both attempted to emphasize the importance of landscape development over time and the generality of Earth's surface processes over different landscapes under different conditions
 jabaki penk or davis or unke anuyaayi mukhyatah pashchimi europe main lekhan or adhyayan kar rahe the, bhu-akruti vigyaan kaa ek anya, mote taur par pruthak skool 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main sanyukt rajya america main viksit hua
 Following the pioneering works of Grove Carl Gilbert in the early 20th century, a group of natural scientists, geologists and hydraulic engineers, including Ralph Elgar Bagnold, John Hack, Luna Leopold, Thomas Medoc, and Arthur Stroller, on elements of landscape shapes Started research such as river and hill slopes, for which they arranged, direct, outperformed their aspects Ratmk took measurements and investigating the scaling of these measurements

 Weathering is the chemical and physical disintegration of Earth's material caused by contact with atmospheric or near surface agents
 sataha ke nazadik in parivartanon ke utpaadon ko baad main kataav ke vibhinn karkon dwaara dur le jaaya ja saktaa he
 The nature of the processes investigated by a geologist is strongly dependent on the landscape or topography involved in the investigation, and the interest of the time and length line
 haalanki, nimnlikhit gaiyr-vistrut suchi inamen se kuch ke saath jude bhudrishy tatwon kii ek jhalak pradaan karti he
 The primary surface processes responsible for most topographic forms include wind, wave, chemical dissolution, mass destruction, groundwater activity, surface water flow, ice action, tectonics, and volcanoes
 anya adhik gambhir bhu-akritik prakriyaaon main shaamil ho saktaa he perigleshial prakriyaayein, namak kii madhyasthata vaali kriya, yaa parloukik prabhaav
 Rivers and streams are not only carriers of water but also sediment
 pani, jab sataha par pravaahman rahata he, to vah talachhaton kaa istemaal karne main sakasham hota he or inhen neeche kii taraf baha le jaataa he, yaa to tal bhaar athwa prasupt bhaar ke rup main yaa phir vighatit bhaar ke rup main
 The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and the discharge of the river
 nadiyaan nae chattaanon kaa apradan karne or nae talachat banane main bhi sakasham hai, apane tal dwaara or aasapaas pahari dhalaanon ke saath yugman dwaara
 is tarah, nadiyon ko gaiyr-himandeey vaataavaran main bade paimaane ke bhudrishy ke liye aadhaar str kii sthapana karne ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Rivers are important sources of exposure to various landscape elements
 jab nadiyaan sthalakritiyon se hote hue pravaahit hoti hai, ve aam taur par aakaar main badi ho jaati hai or anya nadiyon ke saath mil jaati hai
 The network of rivers thus formed is a drainage system and is often dendritic, but may also assume other forms depending on the underlying geology and local topography
 vaiudh prakriyaayein hawa kii gatividhi se sambandhit he or adhik vishisht rup se, prithvi kii sataha ko aakaar dene kii hava kii kshamta se
 hawaaen chizon kaa apradan, parivahan or jamaav kar sakati hai or ye hawaaen un kshetron main adhik prabhavi hoti hai jahaan vanaspati viral hote he or talachat kii paryaapt aapurti hoti he
 Although water and large flows use more material than air in most environments, aeration processes are important in dry environments, deserts
 mitti, regolyth or pathar, gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ke antargat rengte hue, ludhakte hue, behate hue, girte hue nichi kii taraf jate hai
 Such massive breakdowns occur on terrestrial and slopes and have been observed on Earth, Mars, Venus, Titan and Eeapetus
 pahaad ke dhalaanon par chal rahi prakriyaayein dhalaan ke sataha kii sansthiti ko badal sakati hai, jo badale main un prakriyaaon kii daron ko parivartit kar sakati he
 Slopes that deepen to critical conditions are able to quickly release large amounts of material, making the sloping process an important element of landscape in tectonically active areas
 prithvi par, jaivik prakriyaayein jaise ki khudaai yaa tree thro kuch dhalaani prakriyaaon kii daron ko nirdhaarit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 Glaciers, which are geographically limited, are effective factors for landscape change
 ghati main neeche kii taraf dhire-dhire jate barf kii gatividhi neeche kii chattan kaa gharshan karti he or use ukhaad detii he
 Friction produces fine sediment, called glacial flour
 himand ke samaapt ho jane ke baad uske dwaara parivahan kiye gaye malbe ko moren kaha jaataa he
 Glacial erosion is attributed to U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys formed by the river
 himand kii prakriya jis tarah se anya bhudrishy tatwon ke saath sampark karti he, vishesh rup se dhalaani or nadi kii prakriyaaon ke saath, vah plio-plistosin bhudrishy vikaas kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu he or uske talachat kai oonchi pahari ke vaataavaran main milte hai
 Environments that have been snow-capped relatively recently but are no longer can still show higher landscape change rates than landscapes that have never been snow-capped
 gaiyr-himand bhu-akritik prakriyaayein jinhen tis par bhi purv himachhadan dwaara anukulit kiya gaya he unhen parahimanad prakriyaayein kaha jaataa he
 This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by the formation or melting of ice or frost
 bhu-akruti vigyaan par vivartanik prabhaav lakhon saal se lekar ek minute yaa usase kam ke paimaane kaa bhi ho saktaa he
 The effect of tectonics on the landscape largely depends on the design of the underlying rocky bedrock that governs what type of local morphology the tectonics will give
 bukamp, minuton ke andar, vistrut bhu-bhaag ko jalplavit kar sakate hai or ne ardrapradeshon ko janm de sakate hai
 Isostatic rebound can result in significant changes over hundreds or thousands of years and allows additional erosion of the mountain chain, as larger portions are removed from the chain and uplift of the tropics
 dirghakaalik plate vivartanik gatishiltaa, lakhon varshiya jeevankaal vaale orogenic katibandh, vishaal parvat maalaon ko ubharti he, jo nadi or pahari dhalaan kii ucch dar kii prakriyaaon kaa centre hoti he or is prakaar dirghakaalik avsaad utpaadan karti he
 Characteristics of deep crust dynamics, such as plumes and non-lamination of the lower lithosphere, are also believed to play an important role in the large-scale evolution of the Earth's topography in the long term
 donon hi isostacy ke madhyam se utthan ko prerit kar sakate hai, kyonki garam, kam ghanatv vaali papadi kii chattaane, dharti ke andar apekshaakrit thandi, adhik ghanatv vaali papadi kii chattaanon ko visthapit kar detii hai
 Volcanic and volcanic igneous processes can have a significant impact on geomorphology
 jwalamukhi kii ghatana bhu-drishy kaa navinikaran karti he or jameen kii puraani sataha ko lava or tephra se dhak detii he or piroclostic saamagree ko chodta he or nadiyon ko nae raaston par agrasar karti he
 The cone formed by detonation also creates substantial new topography, on which other surface processes can perform their work
 lava kii upsatahi gatividhi bhi bhu-akruti vigyaan main ek bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The melting below the surface can cause inflation and deflation of the ground surface and the partially molten crust layer beneath Tibet has been contributed to control the landscape of the Tibetan plateau spanning thousands of kilometers
 bhu-akritiyon ke saath jeevon kaa sampark yaa jaev-bhu-akritik prakriyaayein kai roopon kii ho sakati hai or shaayad sthaliy bhu-akritik pranali ke liye samgr rup se kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Biology can affect many geomorphic processes, ranging from biogeochemical processes that control chemical weathering to the effects of mechanical processes such as digging and tree throws on soil development and even global erosion rates
 It also involves controlling and modifying the climate through carbon dioxide balance
 sthaliy bhu-drishy jisamen satahi prakriyaaon main madhyasthata karne main jeev-vigyaan kii bhoomika ko nishchit rup se baahar rakhaa ja saktaa he, atyant durlabh hai, lekin ve anya grahon jaise mangal kii bhu-akruti vigyaan ko samajhane ke liye mahatvapurn jaankaree pradaan kar sakate hai
 Different spatial and temporal scales are dominated by different geomorphic processes
 iske alaava, jin paimaanon par prakriyaayein ghatit hoti hai, ve pratikriyaaon yaa duusare rup main bhu-drishy ke badlaav ko prerak baalo ke prati nirdhaarit kar sakati hai, jaise ki jalwaayu yaa vivartaniki
 These ideas are important for the study of geomorphology today
 bhu-drishy paimaanon ko vargeekrut karne ke liye bho-akruti vaigyanik nimnlikhit vargeekaran kaa upyog kar sakate hai: The Khevar Rebellion is a revolt in 1832 against the English led by Bhagirath, Dubai Gosai and Patel Singh in Jharkhand

 The city was the first capital of the Chandel kingdom
 chandel vansh or khajuraho ke sansthaapak chandravarman the
 Chandravarman was the Gurjara king who ruled Bundelkhand in the medieval period
 ve apane aap kaa chandravanshi maanate the
 The Chandela kings ruled Central India from the tenth to the twelfth centuries
 khajuraho ke mandiron kaa nirmaan 950 isvin se 1050 isvin ke bich inhen chandel raajaaon dwaara kiya gaya
 After the construction of the temples, Chandello shifted his capital to Mahoba
 lekin iske baad bhi khajuraho kaa mahatv bana rahaa
 The medieval court poet Chandbardai has described the origin of Chandel in the Mahoba section of Prithviraj Raso
 unhone likhaa he ki kaashi ke rajpandit kii putree hemavathi apurv saundarya kii swamini thi
 One day she was taking a bath in a pond filled with lotus flowers in the summer night
 uski sundarataa dekhakar bhagwaan chandra un par mohit ho gaye
 He came to earth in human form and killed Hemavati
 durbhaagya se hemavathi vidhwaa thi
 She was the mother of a child
 unhone chandradev par apana jivan nasht karne or charitra hanan kaa aarope lagaaya
 To repent of her mistake, Chandra Dev promised Hemvati that she would become the mother of a brave son
 chandradev ne kaha ki vah apane putr ko khajurpura le jaae
 He said that he would become a great king

 Initially, the lander was expected to be developed by Russia in cooperation with India
 jab rus ne 2015 se pehle lander ke vikaas main apni asamarthta jataai
 So the Indian authorities decided to develop the lander independently
 rus lander ko radd karne kaa matlab tha
 That the mission profile will change

 The initial plan was to have the rover designed in Russia and manufactured in India
 haalanki, rus ne may 2010 ko rover ko dizin karne se manaa kar diya
 Subsequently, ISRO decided to design and manufacture the rover itself

 The Maurya dynasty was a powerful and great dynasty of ancient India, the Kamboja dynasty
 isane 137 varsh bharat main rajya kiya
 Its establishment is credited to Chandragupta Maurya and his minister Kautilya, who defeated Emperor Ghanananda of the Nanda dynasty, who was the brother of Chandragupta Maurya
 maury samrajya ke vistaar evam use shaktishaalee banane kaa shrey samraat ashok ko jaataa he
 This empire started in the Magadha kingdom in the east from the plains of the river Ganges
 isaki rajdhani patliputra thi
 Chandragupta Maurya founded this empire in 322 BC and rapidly developed his empire towards the west
 usne kai chote chote kshetreey rajyon ke aapasi matbhedon kaa phayda uthaaya jo sikandar ke akraman ke baad paidaa ho gayi the
 By 316 BCE, the Maurya dynasty had captured the whole of North Western India
 chakravarti samraat ashok ke rajya main maury vansh kaa behad vistaar hua
 It was due to Emperor Ashoka that the Maurya Empire became the most famous and powerful worldwide
 325 isapurv main uttar pashchimi bharat sikandar ke kshatrapon kaa shashan tha
 When Alexander was invading Punjab, a Brahmin named Chanakya came to encourage Magadha for empire expansion
 us samay magadh acha khaasaa shaktishaalee tha tathaa uske padosi rajyon kii ankhon kaa kaanta
 But the then Emperor Ghananand of Magadha turned him down
 usne kaha ki tum ek pandit ho or apni chotii kaa hi dhyaan rakho "yuddh karnaa raja kaa kaam he tum pandit ho sirf panditai karo" tabhi se chanakya ne pratigya liya kii dhananand ko sabak sikhaa ke rahegaa| The Mauryas have been part of the ancient Kshatriya clan
 brahman sahitya,vishakhdutt krit mudrarakshas va justin ityadi unani sroton ke anusaar maury the maury ke utpatti ke vishay par itihaaskaaro ke ek mat nahi he kuch vidwaanon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki chandragupta maury kii utpatti unki mata mura se mili he mura shabd kaa sansodhit shabd maury he, ve aise kabeeley the jo moron kaa paalan karte the
 But it also does not fit well
 For the first time in Indian history, the name of the mother was the son's descendant; Maurya was a powerful dynasty
 He inherited from his father
 The son's name is associated with the father, his origin is from the Vrishala dynasty
 It was done, but no proof of this is available in history, this is the only argument that no one in history has named her dynasty after mother's name, so some historians This is just conjecture
 
 Chandragupta was the son of the same Gana chief who was killed as a warrior in his childhood
 chandragupta main raja banane ke swaabhaavik gun the 'isi yogyata ko dekhte hue chanakya ne use apana shishy bana liya, evam ek sabal raashtra kii niv daali jo kii aaj tak ek adarsh he
 This was followed by a web of spies spread across India to collect secret information against the king as traitors - this was perhaps unprecedented in India
 ek baar aisa ho jane ke baad usne chandragupta ko unani kshatrapon ko maar bhagane ke liye taiyaar kiya
 In this task he was helped by a wide network of detectives
 magadh ke akraman main chanakya ne magadh main grihayuddh ko uksaaya
 His detectives bribed Nanda's officers and made him in his favor
 iske baad nand shaasha ne apana pad chhod diya or chanakya ko vijayshri praapt hui
 Nanda had to lead an exile life after which what happened to him is unknown
 chandragupta maury ne janata kaa vishwaas bhi jeeta or iske saath usko satta kaa adhikaar bhi mila
 At that time, Magadha was the most powerful state in India
 magadh par kabja hone ke baad chandragupta satta ke kendra par kaabiz ho chukaa tha
 Chandragupta started his conquest of western and southern India
 isaki jaankaree apratyaksh saakshyon se milti he
 The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman states that a dam on the Sudarshan Lake was built by Pushyagupta for irrigation
 pushyagupt us samay ashok kaa prantiy rajyapal tha
 After liberating northwest India from Greek rule, its focus shifted to the south
 chandragupta ne sikandar ke senapati celukas ko 305 isapurv ke aasapaas haraaya tha
 The Greek accounts do not refer to this conquest, but this much says that a treaty was signed between Chandragupta and Seleucus according to which Seleucus gave the territories of Kandahar, Kabul, Herat and Baluchistan to Chandragupta
 iske saath hi chandragupta ne use 500 hathi bhent kiye the
 It is also said that Chandragupta established a matrimonial relationship with Seleucus' daughter
 celukas ne megasthaneez ko chandragupta ke darbar main rajdoot ke rup main bheja tha
 According to Plutarch, "sandrocottus had ascended the throne by that time, he had trampled and subjugated the whole of India with his army of 6,00,000 soldiers"
 yah tippanee thodi atishyokti kahi ja sakati he kyonki itnaa gyaat he ki kaveri nadi or uske dakshin ke kshetron main us samay cholon, pandyon, satyaputron tathaa keralaputron kaa shashan tha
 Ashoka's inscriptions have been found in Chittaladurg, Yeragudi and Maski in Karnataka
 uske shilalikhit dharmopadesh pratham tathaa trayodash main unke padosi chol, pandya tathaa anya rajyon kaa varnan miltaa he
 Since there is no information that Ashoka or his father Bindusar had fought any war in the south and conquered it, it is believed that Chandragupta had conquered them
 apane jivan ke uttarardh main usne jain dharm apana liya tha or singhaasana tyagkar karnataka ke shravanbelagola main apane guru jainmuni bhadrabahu ke saath sanyasi jivan vyateet karne laga tha
 After Chandragupta his son Bindusara was ruling but not much is known about him
 dakshin kii ore samrajya vistaar kaa shrey yada kada bindusaar ko diya jaataa he hanlanki uske vijay abhiyaan kaa koi sakshya nahin he
 According to the Jain tradition, his mother's name was Durdhar and Bindusara ruled in the Puranas for 25 years
 use amitraghaat kii oopaadhi bhi di jaati he jise unani granthon main amitrochatus kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Bindusar Azivak believed in Dharam
 usne ek unani shaasha en tiocus pratham se sukhi anjir, mithi sharaab va ek darshanik kii maang kii thi
 Emperor Ashoka is one of the greatest rulers not only of India but of the history of the world
 samrajya ke vistaar ke atirikt prashasan tathaa dharmik sahishnutaa ke kshetra main un kaa naam abbar jaise mahaan shaskaon ke saath liya jaataa he
 Although he has been a very powerful and great emperor than Akbar
 kai vidwaan to samraat ashok ko vishwa itihaas ke sabase safal shaasha bhi maanate hai
 During the days of his prince, he suppressed the rebellions of Ujjain and Taxila
 par kaling kii ladaai unke jivan main ek nirnaayak mode sabit hui or unka man yuddh main hue narsanhaar se glani se bhar gaya
 He embraced Buddhism and did many things to propagate it
 samraat ashok ko buddha dharm me upagupt ne dikshit kiya tha
 He held the title of Devanapriya, Priyadarshi
 samraat ashok ke shilaalekh tathaa shilotkeern upadesh bhartiya upmahadweep main jagah-jagah paae gaye hai
 He also sent his preachers abroad to preach Dhamma
 jin-jin deshon main prachaarak bheje gaye unamem syria tathaa pashchim asia kaa anteocus theos, misr kaa tolemi philadelus, macedoniya kaa antigons gonathas, sairin kaa megas tathaa epiras kaa alacgander shaamil the
 He sent his son Mahendra from the capital Pataliputra through the Sri Lanka waterway
 patna kaa aitihaasik mahendru ghat usee ke naam par namakrit he
 Emperor Ashoka maintained a large army even after the war broke out
 aisa videshi akraman se samrajya ke patan ko rokane ke liye aavashyak tha
 The capital of the Maurya Empire was Pataliputra
 iske atirikt samrajya ko prashasan ke liye chaar or praanton main baanta gaya tha
 Tausali was the capital of the eastern part and Suvarnagiri of the southern part
 isi prakaar uttari tathaa pashchimi bhaag kii rajdhani kramshah takshashila tathaa ujjain thi
 Apart from this, Samapa, Ishila and Kaushambi were also important cities
 rajya ke praantapalon kumaar hote the jo sthaneey praanton ke shaasha the
 There was a Council of Ministers and Mahamatyas in every province to help Kumar
 praant aage jilon main bante hote the
 Each district was divided into village groups
 pradeshik jila prashasan kaa pradhan hota tha
 The rope was used to measure the ground
 prashasan kii sabase choti ikai gaanv thi jiskaa pradhan graamic kehalaata tha
 Kautilya has written an entire chapter in economics about the administration of cities
 vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki us samay patliputra tathaa anya nagaron kaa prashasan is sinddhant ke anuroop hi rahaa hoga
 Megasthenes describes the administration of Pataliputra
 uske anusaar patliputra nagar kaa shashan ek nagar parishad dwaara kiya jaataa tha jisamen 30 sadsy the
 These thirty members were divided into six committees with five members each
 prayek samiti kaa kuch nishchit kaam hota tha
 The work of the first committee was related to industrial and artistic production
 iskaa kaam vetan nirdhaarit karnaa tathaa milawat rokna bhi tha
 The second committee looked into the affairs of people coming from outside in Pataliputra, especially foreigners
 teesri samiti kaa taalluk janm tathaa mrityu ke panjikaran se tha
 The fourth committee regulated trade and commerce
 iskaa kaam nirmit maal kii bikri tathaa panya par nazar rakhana tha
 The fifth was to keep an eye on the manufacture of goods, and the sixth work was to be done
 nagar parishad ke dwaara janakalyaan ke kaary karne ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke adhikari bhi niyukt kiye jate the, jaise - sadakon, bazaaron, chikitsaalayon, devalayon, shiksha-sansthaaon, jalaapurti, bandargahon kii marammat tathaa rakrakhaav kaa kaam karnaa
 The principal officer of the city was called Nagark
 kautilya ne nagar prashasan main kai vibhaagon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he jo nagar ke kai kaaryakalapon ko niyamit karte the, jaise - lekha vibhaag, rajasav vibhaag, khan tathaa khanij vibhaag, rath vibhaag, seemaa shulk or kar vibhaag
 Another thing which was unprecedented in India during the Maurya Empire was the Mauryo's intelligence trap
 us samay puure rajya main guptcharon kaa jaal bicha diya gaya tha jo rajya par kisi bahari akraman yaa aantarik vidroh kii khabar prashasan tathaa sena tak pahunchaate the
 National political unity was established in India only during the reign of Maurya dynasty
 maury prashasan main satta kaa sudrudh kendriyakaran tha parantu raja nirankush nahin hota tha
 During the Mauryan period, the Republic declined and the political system was strengthened
 kautilya ne rajya sapthank siddhanth nirdisht kiya tha, jinke aadhaar par maury prashasan or uski grih tathaa videsh niti sanchalit hoti thi - raja, amaatya janapad, durg, kosh, sena or, mitra
 One result of the establishment of such a large empire was that there was economic integration throughout the empire
 kisaanon ko sthaneey rup se koi kar nahin dena padataa tha, hanlanki iske badale unhen kadai se par vaazib maatra main kar kendriya adhikariyon ko dena padataa tha
 The currency of that time was gage
 arthshaastra main in panon ke vetanmanon kaa bhi ullikh miltaa he
 The minimum salary was 60 panas while the maximum salary was 48,000 panas
 chhathi sadi isa purv takabharat main dharmik sampradaayon kaa prachlan tha
 All these religions were associated with Vedic practice in one way or the other
 chhathi sadi isapurv main koi 62 sampradaayon ke astitv kaa pataa chalaa he jisamen buddha tathaa jain sampradaay kaa udai kaalaantar main anya kii apeksha adhik hua
 By the time of the Mauryas, Buddhist and Jain communities had developed
 udhar dakshin main shaiva tathaa vaishnav sampradaay bhi viksit ho rahe the
 Chandragupta Maurya had renounced his throne and converted to Jainism
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki chandragupta ne apane guru jainmuni bhadrabahu ke saath karnataka ke shravanbelagola main sanyasi ke rup main rahane laga tha
 In later inscriptions, it is found that Chandragupta died at the same place by fasting fast as a true devoted Jain
 vahaan paas main hi chandragiri naam kii pahari he jiskaa namaakaran shaayad chandragupta ke naam par hi kiya gaya tha
 Ashoka adopted Buddhism after the Kalinga war
 iske baad usne dhamm ke prachaar main apana dhyaan lagaaya
 Here Dhamma meant "moral principles", not religion or religion or religion
 us samay na to islam kaa janm hua tha or na hi isiyat kaa
 Therefore, those moral principles were not to oppose any religion outside, but to provide a moral law to man
 apane duusare shilaalekh main usne likhaa he - " dhamm kya he? alp dushkarm tathaa adhik satkarm
 Avoiding evils like fury, cruelty, anger, pride and jealousy, and observance of virtues such as mercy, generosity, truth, self-control, simplicity, attachment to morality, purity of heart, and internal and external purity
 " After adopting Buddhism, he also tried to bring it into life
 usne shikaar karnaa or pashuon kii hatya chhod diya tathaa manushyon tathaa jaanwaron ke liye chikitsaalayon kii sthapana karai
 He generously donated to Brahmins and ascetics of various religious creeds
 iske alaava usne aaramgrih, evam dharmashala, kuen tathaa baavariyon kaa bhi nirmaan kaary karaayaa
 He appointed officers of the rank of Dharmamahatra whose work was to propagate Dhamma to the general public
 usne videshon main bhi apane prachaarak dal bheje
 Apart from neighboring countries, he also sent missionaries to Egypt, Syria, Macedonia Cyrene and Epirus
 halanki ashok ne khud buddha dharm apana liya tha par usne anya sampradaayon ke prati bhi aadar kaa bhav rakhaa tathaa unke viruddh kisi kaarywahi kii ullekh nahin miltaa he
 Shan Vistrath was in the Mauryan period sainya vyavastha chah samitiyon main vibhakt sainya vibhaag dwaara nirdisht thi
 Each committee consisted of five military experts
 paidal sena, ashv sena, gaj sena, rath sena tathaa nau sena kii vyavastha thi
 The highest officer of military management was called Antapal
 yah seemaant kshetron kaa bhi vyavasthaapak hota tha
 According to Megasthenes, Chandragupta Maurya's army was invincible soldiers equipped with six lakh footmen, fifty thousand horsemen, nine thousand elephants and eight hundred chariots
 chandragupta maury ne shashan sanchaalan ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye chaar praanton main vibhajit kar diya tha jinhen chakra kaha jaataa tha
 The rule of these provinces was governed by the representative of the emperor
 samraat ashok ke kaal main praanton kii sankhya paanch ho gai thi
 These provinces were- praachi - patliputra Uttarapath - Taxila dakshinapath - suvarnagiri Avanti Nation - Ujjayini kaling - tosli The provinces were administered by officials named Dynastic Kumar
 kumarabhashya kii sahaayta ke liye prayek praant main mahapaatr naamak adhikari hote the
 At the apex, the central division of the empire was subsequently divided into provincial diets
 gram prashasan kii nimna ikai tha, 100 gram ke samooh ko sangrahan kaha jaataa tha
 The diet was subject to the subject
 jile ke prashasnic adhikari sthanik tha
 Gop used to arrange ten villages
 megasthnij ke anusaar maury shashan kii nagareey prashasan chah samiti main vibhakt tha

 web rang ve rang hote hai, jo ki web panne roopankan hetu prayog hote hai
 Web design authors have a lot of options to describe these colors to web components
 inhen bataaya ja saktaa he jaise shaddashamalav roopakar main RGB triplate
 Web colors are colors that are used to design web pages
 web roopankan ke kartaaon ke paas bahut vikalp hote hai, in rangon ko web ghatakon kaa vivaran dene hetu
 These can be described as RGB triplets in a conspiracy form
 ek shaddashamalav triplate hota he ek chah ank, teen bite shaddashamalav sankhya, jo ki HTML main prayukt hoti he rangon ke pradarshan hetu
 The three bytes represent the red, green, blue components of a single color
 ek bite hoti he 00 se FF tak, yaa 0 se 255 
 This represents the least to the most intensity of each of the color components
 The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order: For example, consider the color where the red / green / blue values are decimal numbers: red = 36, green = 104, blue = 160
 The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are 24, 68 and A0 respectively in hexadecimal notation
 To obtain the hex triplet, we simply write the three hex bytes together without spaces, thus: 2468A0
 If a byte is less than 10 or 16 it must be represented with a leading zero to keep the number of digits in the triplet equal to six
 For example, the decimal triplet 0,1,2 would be represented by the hex triplet 000102
 The number of colors that can be represented by this system is An abbreviated, three digit form is sometimes used
 Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC
 This allows each color value to cover its full range from 00 to FF
 Converting a decimal RGB value to a hexadecimal value is fairly straightforward
 Decimal RGB values are usually given in the 0-255 range; if they are in the 0-1 range, multiply the value by 255 before conversion
 This number divided by 16 gives us the first hexadecimal digit 
 The remainder, times 16 again, gives us the second digit
 For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C
 a remainder of 9 gives us the hexadecimal number C9
 This process is repeated for each of the three color values
 Most modern operating systems have a built-in calculator to perform conversions between number bases and this can also be done with some hand-held calculators
 This task can also be carried out using various web resources
 The HTML 4
01 specification defines sixteen named colors, as follows: These 16 were also specified as srgb and included in the HTML 3
0 specification which noted "these colors were originally picked as being the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette
" In addition, a number of colors are defined by web browsers
 a particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005 all modern general-use browsers support the full list
 Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the x Window System
 These colors were standardized by SVG 1
0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents
 They are not part of SVG Tiny
 Almost the exact same color names are used in 
NET Framework, in the knowncolor and Color enumerations
 The only color difference is darkseagreen which is defined as 8F,BC,8B 
 The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below, compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards
 saanchaa:color depthanother set of 216 color values is commonly considered to be the "web-safe" color palette, developed at a time when many computer displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors
 a set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six shades each of red, green, and blue 
 The "web-safe" colors do not all have names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet
 Below are the values for the 6 shades of each color out of 256 possible color shades
 The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors, underlining the really-safe colors
the lack of gamma correction means that the six desired intensities 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% are displayed as 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, and 100% on a Windows standard 2
5 gamma CRT or LCD, making most colors very dark
 The intensities at the low end of the range, especially 0 and 3, are nearly indistinguishable from each other: Note that in the table below, each color code listed is a short-hand for the RGB value; for example, code 609 is equivalent to RGB code 660099
 The Cascading Style Sheets language defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 listed previously
additionally, CSS 2
1 adds the 'orange' color name to the list: CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2
1 also allow web authors to use so-called system colors, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system
 This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent
 As of early 2004, it appears that the CSS3 color module will once again drop these values, marking them deprecated, but this may change
 The developing CSS3 specification will also introduce HSL color space values to style sheets: a goddess of ancient Egyptian religion

 The required gradient depends on the maximum speed at which the trains are expected to move, ie their assumed velocity
 dhaal nimnlikhit sutara ke anusaar nishchit kii jaati he : q = V2 / 
 yahan q = dhaal, = Maximum imaginary velocity and r = mode kii trigya a train traveling at an assumed speed on the right lifting road will run smoothly and safely, without the tendency to slip

 But on the road, a variety of trains run at both fast and slow speeds

 For this reason, according to the standards of the Indian Road Congress in India, the limit of slope has been fixed at 1 in 15
 duusare deshon main yadhyapi 10 main 1 tak kii dhaal kii anumati hoti he, to bhi saadhaarant: dhaal 15 main 1 se adhik nahin hoti
