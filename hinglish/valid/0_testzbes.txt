 Parmar dynastic kings ruled from Malwa's capital Dharanagri from the eighth century to the first half of the fourteenth century
 bhoj ne bahut se yuddh kiye or apni pratishtha sthapit kii jisase siddh hota he ki unamem asaadhaaran yogyata thi
 Although most of his life was spent on the battlefield, he did not allow any kind of hindrance in the progress of his kingdom
 unhone malwa ke nagaron va graamon main bahut se mandir banawaye, yadhyapi unamem se ab bahut kam kaa pataa chalata he
 It is said that the capital of present-day Madhya Pradesh was settled by Raja Bhoj, then its name was Bhojpal Nagar, which later became Bhupal and then Bhopal
 raja bhoj ne bhopal nagar ke paas hi ek samudr ke samaan vishaal talab kaa nirmaan karaayaa tha, jo purv or dakshin main bhojpur ke vishaal shiv mandir tak jaataa tha
 Even today, on the way to Bhojpur, near the Shiv temple, a huge sail made of stones of that pond is seen
 us samay us talab kaa pani bahut pavitra or bimariyon ko thik karne vaala mana jaataa tha
 It is said that Raja Bhoj had a skin disease when a sage or a Vaidya advised him to bathe and drink in the water of this pond, which cured his skin
 us vishaal talab ke pani se shivmandir main sthapit vishaal shivlinga kaa abhishek bhi kiya jaataa tha
 Raja Bhoj himself was a very great scholar and he is said to have written books on various subjects such as religion, astronomy, art, lexicography, building construction, poetry, pharmacology etc
 which still exist
 inke samay main kaviyon ko rajya se aashray mila tha
 He ruled from 1000 AD to 1055 AD
 inaki vidwata ke kaaran janamanas main ek kahawat prachlit hui kahan raja bhoj kahan gangu taili
 Bhoja was very brave, majestic, and virtuous
 inhone anek deshon par vijay praapt kii thi or kai vishyon ke anek granthon kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 He was a very good poet, philosopher and astrologer
 saraswatikanthabharan, shringarmanjari, champuramayana, charucharya, tatvaprakash, vyavaharasamucchy aadi anek granth inke likhe hue batalaaye jate hai
 His meeting was always decorated with great priests
 inaki patni kaa naam leelavati tha jo bahut badi vidhushi thi
 When the banquet was alive it was said- he; saraswati ko sadaa aalamb mila hua he; sabhi pandit aadrut hai
 ) jab unka dehant hua to kaha gaya - Raja Bhoj was the son of Munj's younger brother Sindhuraj
 rohak inkaa pradhan mantri or bhuvanpaal mantri tha
 Kulachandra, Sadi and Taraditya were his commanders, with whose help Bhoja handled the operations smoothly
 apane chachaa munj kii hi bhanti yah bhi pashchimi bharat main ek samrajya sthapit karnaa chaahate the or is ichha kii purti ke liye inhen apane padosi rajyon se har disha main yuddh karnaa padaa
 Parmar was very agitated after Munj died in a mourning situation and hence Parmar was inspired by the Bhoj Chalukyas to march south with the idea of revenge lane
 unhone ne daahal ke kalburi gangeyadev tathaa thanjore ke rajendra chol se sandhi kii ore saath hi saath dakshin par akraman bhi kar diya, parantu tatkaaleen raja chalukya jaisingh dwitiya ne bahaduree se saamana kiya or apana rajya bachaa liya
 Sometime after 1044 AD, Someshwar II, the son of Jai Singh again turned hostile to the Paramaras and attacked the Malwa kingdom and forced Bhoja to flee
 dharanagari par adhikaar kar lene ke baad usne aag laga di, parantu kuch hi dinon baad someshwar ne maalav chhod diya or bhoj ne rajdhani main lotakar phir sattadhikaar praapt kar liya
 Shortly before 1018 AD, Bhoja defeated a person named Indaratha, possibly a feudatory of the Gang kings of Kalinga
 jaisingh dwitiya tathaa indrarath ke saath yuddh samaapt kar lene par bhoj ne apni sena bharat kii pashchimi seemaa se lage hue deshon kii ore badhaai or pehle laat naamak rajya par, jiskaa vistaar dakshin main bombai rajya ke antargat surat tak tha, akraman kar diya
 King Chalukya Kirtiraj surrendered there and Bhoja held the authority for some time
 iske baad lagbhag san 1020 i
 main bhoj ne laat ke dakshin main sthit tathaa thana jile se lekar malagaar samudratat tak vistrut konkan par akraman kiya or shilaharon ke arikeshari naamak raja ko haraaya
 The Konkan were annexed into the kingdom of Paramaras and the Shilahars as their feudatories reigned here for some time
 san 1008 i
 main jab mahmud gazanabi ne punjabe shahi naamak rajya par akraman kiya, bhoj ne bharat ke anya rajyon ke saath apni sena bhi akramanakari kaa virodh karne tathaa shahi anandapal kii sahaayta karne ke hetu bheji parantu hindu raajaaon ke is mail kaa koi fal na niklaa or is avasar par unki haar ho gai
 In 1043 AD, Bhoja sent his fellow soldiers to the king of Delhi to fight against the Muslims of Punjab
 us samay punjab gazani samrajya kaa hi ek bhaag tha or mahmud ke vanshaj hi vahaan rajya kar rahe the
 The Raja of Delhi got help from other parts of India and he traveled towards Punjab and defeated the Muslims and occupied some part of that country for a few days but in the end the king of Ghazni defeated him and lost the lost part again in his empire
 Got it
 bhoj ne ek baar daahal ke kalchuri gangeyadev ke viruddh bhi chadhaai kar di jisane dakshin par akraman karne ke samay uskaa saath diya tha
 Ganga Deva lost but did not have to surrender
 san 1055 i
 ke kuch hi pehle gangey ke putr karn ne gujarat ke chaulukya bhim pratham ke saath ek sandhi kar lee or maalav par purv tathaa pashchim kii ore se akraman kar diya
 Bhoja was making arrangements to save his kingdom that he died suddenly due to illness and the state easily went to the invaders
 uttar main bhoj ne chandelon ke desh par bhi akraman kiya tha jahaan vidyadhar naamak raja rajya karata tha
 But there was no benefit from it
 bhoj ke gwalior par vijay praapt karne ke praytn kaa bhi koi acha fal na hua kyonki vahaan ke raja kachchapaghat kirtiraj ne uske akraman kaa datakar saamana kiya
 It is believed that Bhoja had also conquered Kannauj for some time during the post-transformation period of the decline of Pratiharas
 bhoj ne rajasthan main shakambhari ke chaahamanon ke viruddh bhi yuddh kii ghoshnaa kii or tatkaaleen raja chaahmaan veeryaram ko haraaya
 He then threatened to win a kingdom called Shalit Nadul by the Anhil of the family of Chahmanas, but Parmar was defeated in the war and his chief commander-in-law, Sadi, lost his life
 bhoj ne gujarat ke chaulukyon se bhi, jinhone apni rajdhani anhilapattan main banaai thi, bahut dinon tak yuddh kiya
 Chamudaraja, son of Chalukya Solanki King Moolraj I, had to be humiliated by the arms of Parmar Bhoja in Malwa while going to Varanasi
 uske putr evam uttaradhikari ballabhraj ko isapar bada krodh aayaa or usne is apmaan kaa badla lene kii sochi
 He prepared a large army against Bhoja and attacked Bhoja, but unfortunately he died of smallpox on the way
 iske baad vallabhraj ke chote bhai durlabhraj ne satta kii bagdor apan haathon main lee
 After some time, the BJP also defeated him in the war
 durlabhraj ke uttaradhikari bhim ke rajyakaal main bhoj ne apane senapati kulchandra ko gujarat ke viruddh yuddh karne ke liye bheja
 Kulchandra conquered the entire region and looted his capital Anhilapattan
 bhim ne ek baar abu par akraman kar uske raja parmaar dhandu ko haraaya tha, jab use bhagkar chitrakoot main bhoj kii sharan leni padi thi
 As mentioned above, shortly before 1055 AD, Bhima attacked Malwa by entering into a treaty with Kalachuri Karna, but he could not get possession of that region during the banquet
 raja bhoj bahut bade vir or pratapi hone ke saath-saath prakand pandit or gungrahi bhi the
 He produced many texts of many subjects
 ye bahut achche kavi, darshanik or jyotishi the
 Many texts like Saraswati Kantabharan, Shringaramanjari, Champuramayan, Charuchara, Tattvaprakash, Behavansamuchya etc
 are written in this

 His wife's name was Lilavati, who was a great student

 The major responsibility of distributing the "hindustan-democratic Union Manifesto - The Revolutionary" by the well-known revolutionary Shachindranath Sanyal in 1924 on 1 January 1925 was on the Bhagwati stage itself
 jise unhone bakhubi puraa kiya
 In later times, doubts were raised about Bhagwati Charan in the organization's associates that they are CID men and get paid from them
 in aaropon ko lagane ke peeche us samay sanghathan main aaye ve log the jinhen kisi kaam kaa jokhim nahin uthaanaa tha
 Therefore, they also wanted to not only lead themselves by accusing the rich Bhagwati Charan of multi-faceted personality
 balki krantikari kaarywahiyon par roak bhi lagaana chaahate the
 The aim of such people was also to limit the work of the organization to mutual debate, persuasion, publicity and money-gathering

 Cleaning and earning names is not their job
 " Bhagwati Charan was also accused in the Kakori case of Lucknow, the Lahore Conspiracy Case and then the murder of English Sergeant - Sanders who killed Lala Lajpat Rai
 par na to kabhi pakade gayi or na hi krantikari kaaryo ko karne se apana pair peeche khichaa
 The proof of this is that despite being surrounded by so many allegations, Bhagwati Charan tried his best to blow the Viceroy sitting in a special train in the moving train

 After a month's preparation, people also managed to detonate the bomb under the special train passing on the due date

el 480 yojana bhi thi 1, the old industrial industry was destroyed by the members of India, which was a great source of employment and part of our cultural heritage
 Describing the results of Daniel Tharner who has critically analyzed this concept, he continued till the world war
 It was done with some thoughtful tricks so that the Industrial Revolution could be successful in Britain, so that India was made the largest area of free trade, this process accelerated the withdrawal of funds from India! 2 India's traditional self-sufficiency was ended! 3 working labor force reduced especially in the short run! There was also a shortage of employment in 4 construction industries
 5 Indian handicrafts and cottage industries were destroyed, cities were devastated due to the industrial revolution in the west, but the artisans got into new jobs but in India they had to become farmers because new industries were not developed here! 6 India market was filled with British goods
 He used to export only raw materials!

 India was the center of wealth accumulation, was the supplier of the demands of the world, thus India was the ocean in which rivers of wealth were falling, but anything that came out was changed after the Battle of Palasi and Buxar, after which the economy of India became self-sufficient
 By no means, he had fallen prey to the International Shosan, it was now being used for the use of Britain's interests, as a result of this, the Indian manufactured goods of Noryat On the spot, the supply of goods and british became the importer of industrial goods
 Free trade policy, such measures ruined India's industry
 Finally India became a classical colony
 In the words of Karl Marx, the house of the suit was filled with cotton
 The character of India's economy had changed! The question of withdrawal of money - towards this show was first understood and demonstrated by Dada Bhai Naoroji

 He then took 21 wickets against Australia at home and took 24 wickets against England in 1984 in England
 vahaan hedingle main kshetrarakshan karte hue unke baayein haath kaa angootha tut gaya tha
 He still came to bat and persisted for so long that Larry Gomes completed his century
 unhone phir gendbaaji karke 53 ran dekar 7 wicket bhi liye
 It is counted as one of his best performances
 garnor or holding ke sanyas lene ke baad 1988 tak courtney walsh or kirtli ambros unke anya mahatvapurn gendbaaj saathi ban chuke the
 Because of this, his work load was rarely in his entire career
 phir bhi 1983 se 1991 kii avadhi main unke naam 69 maichon main 342 wicket he, jo ki kisi bhi gendbaaj ke muqaabale sabase zyada he

 lazanya ek behtareen italvi pasta cassarol pakwaan he jisamen ek ke baad ek pasta, chiz, sos or praayah anya saamagreeyon kii paraten hoti hai
 According to the distinctiveness of Italian cuisine, many regional forms exist
 kuch kshetron main, vishesh rup se italy ke dakshini kshetron main istemaal kiye jane vaale sos ke yaa to saadhaaran tamaato sos hone kii sambhaavna hoti he yaa ragu hone kii, jabaki anya kshetron main, vishesh rup se uttari italy main, bechmel sos kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The term is used for both dish and pasta crust
 lazanya ekvachan shabd he, jabaki lazaanye iskaa bahuvachan he
 In Britain, its plural name is used for this dish
 lazanya shabd, jo mul rup se ek khaanaa pakaane ke bartan ko kehete hai, ab keval vyanjan ko hi varnit karata he
 Although it is generally believed that the dish originated in Italy, one theory is that the word "lazanias" came from the Greek λάσανα or λάσανον which means "stand of pot or pot", "pee"
 The Romans adopted the word as "lasanam", which means "cooking utensil" in the Latin language
 The people of Italy used the term to refer to the vessel in which lazanya was made
 baad main pakwaan, parose jane vaali thali ke naam se janaa jane laga
 Another theory suggests that the word lazanya may have originated from the Greek word λάγανον, which means a flattened crust of pasta flour cut into flakes
 It is an interesting information that the word λαγάνα is still used in Greek which means a kind of thin flat unleavened bread
 lazanya banane kii vidhi ko england main prakashit sabase pehali paak pustika main vishesh rup se prakashit kiya gaya tha, jiske parinamswaroop bane ek shehri katha ke anusaar yah pakwaan british iles main taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 In view of the Roman already used "lasanam", this claim seems doubtful

 There are three types of reactions in inflammation: pargilan yaa oothkakshay evam ni:sravan pratikriyaayein ugr pradaah main tathaa oothkakshay or prachurodbhavan dirghakaalik pradaah main pradhanthya hote hai
 In all these reactions, blood and lymph, and various components of connective and sensory tissue participate
 rog ke sookshm jeevanu sharir main pravesh kar shleshmakala par athwa rakt evam lasika kii nalikaaon se hokar, sanyojak or indriya utakon main pradaah kii pratikriya prarambh kar dete hai
 If the germs are in excess, or their toxic strength is high, or the body's resistance is reduced, the inflammation takes a violent form
 ye pratikriyaayein nimnlikhit rup se sampann hoti he: pratham rakt kii sookshm dhamnikaaye kshanik samay ke vaaste sikudti hai
 This causes the flow of blood inside those arteries to intensify, then these arteries widen and the flow of blood slows down inside them

 The cells of the wall of these microscopic capillaries increase their number by proliferation and take the shape of amoebae, causing the wall of cells to become rough

 Along with these, red particles of blood also come out at the inflammation

 These white cells converge in the body's environment stimulated by a symbolic expression of a particular substance

 The fluid in the blood depends on the stimulated power generated by the toxin of the microbes at that inflammatory place, especially on the wall of microscopic cells

 In the beginning of acute inflammation, only the multicellular white cells carry out the bactericidal activity predominantly
 paap utpannkaaree rogaanu in koshikaon ko apni ore adhik maatra main aakarshith karte hai, isaliye is prakaar ke pradaahon main bahukhandee koshikaaye hi adhik maatra main aakarshith karte hai, isaliye is prakaar ke pradaahon main bahukhandee koshikaaye hi adhik maatra main milti hai
 The solids and fluids of the blood and various components of tissue protect the body from its shock by lightening the amount of toxin produced by microbes

 Both actions - first, bacteriophage and second, the exit of the plasma by the blood vessels - lead the body to get rid of the damage caused by microbes
 ye sab vividh kriyaayein rasinic padaartho evam tantrikaon ke protsaahan dwaara sampann hoti hai
 If the number of germs and the stimulating power is not high and the body's resistance is abundant, then the multicellular white cells declare victory over these bacteria and swallow them by bactericidal action
 is kriya main kuch bahukhandee koshikaaye bhi dharashayi ho jaati hai
 These streamlined cells produce a type of protein solvent that dissolves dead tissues, etc
, and takes away the fluid from the inflammation and the white cells and germs from the lymph nodes by the lymph nodes
 yadi rogaanu apane vish dwaara vijayi hote hai, to pradaah sthaan main bahukhandee koshikaaye bahut adhik maatra main dharashayi ho jaati hai or ve pip kaa rup le leti hai
 The inflammation changes from red to yellow
 isi ko pakaa phoda kehete hai
 When the boils are treated by drugs, the germs are destroyed and at the end of the inflammation at that place, the blood and the monolithic cells of the tissues collect, and destroy the germs by swallowing them at a rapid speed

 The effect of the stimulating power produced by these microbes takes the form of long lasting inflammation on the body
 is pravaah main ni:sravan kriya bahut kam maatra main hoti he, isaliye isamen bahukhandee koshikaaye bhi vishesh bhaag nahin letin
 In place of them, lymphocytes, plasma cells and non-permanent cells of tissues increase in number by proliferation and collect at the inflammation site

 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya

 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea

 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians

 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians

 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia

 ve germany ke statagart nagar main 22 agast 1907 main hui saatvin antarrashtriya congress main bharat kaa pratham tirangaa rashtradhvaj fahraane ke liye suvikhyath hai
 At that time the tricolor was not as it is today
 unke dwaara paris se prakashit "vandemaataram" patr pravasi bharatiyon main kaaphi lokapriy hua
 At the International Socialist Congress held in Stuttgart, Germany in 1907, Madame Bhikaji Cama said that - "continuation of British rule in India is a stigma in the name of humanity
" ek mahaan desh bharat ke hiton ko isse baari kshati pahunch rahi he
 "he appealed to the people to cooperate in liberating India from slavery and called upon the Indians that -" Go ahead, we are Hindustani and Hindustan belongs to Hindustan
 " ’’ yahi nahin madam bhikaaji kama ne is conference main ‘vandemaataram’ ankit bharat kaa pratham tirangaa rashtradhvaj fahraa kar angrejon ko kadi chunauti di
 Madam Bhikaji was also the private secretary of Dada Bhai Naoroji in Cama London

 Mrs
 Cama's great contribution was to raise the world public opinion against imperialism and to present India's desire for freedom from foreign rule
 bharat kii swadhinata ke liye ladate hue unhone lambii avadhi tak nirvasit jivan bitaayaa tha
 According to the facts, although Bhikaji believed in non-violence, he also called for opposition to unjust violence

 She was recovered after treatment but was advised to go to Europe for rest and further treatment
 varsh 1902 main vah isi silsile main landan gayi or vahaan bhi unhone bhartiya swadhinata sangharsh ke liye kaam jari rakhaa
 In 1907, Bhikaji, with the help of his colleague Sardarsingh Rana, designed the first design of India's first tricolor national flag
 bhikaaji kama ne 22 agast 1907 ko germany main hui international socialist conference main bhartiya swatantraaa ke dhwajbharat kaa pratham tirangaa rashtradhvaj ko buland kiya tha
 At that conference, he appealed to free India from British rule
 unke taiyaar kiye gaye jhande se kaaphi milte−julate digaayan ko baad main bharat ke dhvaj ke rup main apanaaya gaya
 This India's first tricolor national flag, built by Ranaji and Kamaji, is still kept safe in the house of BJP leader Rajubhai Rana, grandson of Sardarsingh Rana in Bhavnagar, Gujarat
 vah apane krantikari vichaar apane samachar-patr ‘vandemaataram’ tathaa ‘talwaar’ main prakat karti thim
 Mrs
 Cama's fight was against imperialism around the world
 vah bharat ke swadhinata andolan ke mahatva ko khub samajhati thim, jiskaa lakshya sampurna prithvi se samrajyavad ke prabhutv ko samaapt karnaa tha
 His colleagues considered him the 'mother of the Indian revolution'; Whereas the British called her a notorious woman, dangerous revolutionary, anarchist revolutionary, anti-british and inconsistent
 europe ke samaajawaadee samudaay main shrimati kama kaa paryaapt prabhaav tha
 This was evident when he invited European journalists to defend their patriots
 vah ‘bhartiya rashtriyata kii mahaan pujaarin’ ke naam se vikhyath thim
 His portrait appeared in French newspapers with Joan of Arc
 yah is tathy kii bhavpurn abhivyakti thi ki shrimati kama kaa europe ke rashtriya tathaa loktantric samaaj main vishisht sthaan tha
 In the flag waving by Bhikaji, there was an attempt to assimilate the feelings and culture of different religions of the country
 usamen islam, hindutv or buddha mat ko pradarshit karne ke liye haraa, pilaa or laal rang istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Also, in the middle of it was written Vande Mataram in Devanagari script

 kuch dhaatuon main praathmik bandhuta ke atirikt ek or bandhuta hoti he, jise 'dwitiyak' bandhuta kehete hai
 This secondary fraternity itself was given the name of 'subcomponent' and 'subcomponent-compound' of such compounds
 aise yogicon ko verner ne ucch varg yogic kaha he
 Positive ions, especially when they are small and highly charged, attract electrons from the lateral negative ions or neutral molecules that have 'unsolvable' electrons
 yadi aakarshan adhik he, to dhatvik aayan or anya samoohon ke bich electron sajhi ho jaataa he
 The metallic ion is called 'receiver' and the other group as 'donor'
 jab platinic chloride ko ammonia ke saath upachaarit kiya jaataa he tab aisa hi yogic, hexaminic platinic hexachloride, banataa he
 The formation of chemical compounds is known by the variation in color, solubility and other properties of such compounds
 aise bane platinum ke yogic main na platinum ke or na chlorine ke hi pareekshak lakshan paae jate hai
 The groups in which the stranded electrons reside are ammonia, water, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, alkyl amine, dialkyl amine, trialkyl amine, alkyl sulfide, cyanide, thiocyanide, etc
 yogicon main do, yaa do se adhik, kism ke daata rah sakate hai
 The number of donor groups in centrally located metallic ions remains fixed for each metallic ion
 aisi sankhya ko upasahsanyojaktaa-sankhya kehete hai
 According to Sijvik this number depends on the atomic number of elements
 yah do se aath tak ho sakati he
 Hydrogen has a valency number of two and heavy metals eight
 yadi daata samooh yaa parmaanu main ek jode se adhik asajhi electron vidyaman hon, to aise samooh yaa parmaanu do dhatvik yanon se sanyukt ho sakate hai
 In this manner, binary complexes are formed
 aisa hi ek dwinabhik sanmishra dieol owatemin dicobaltic sulphate he: If the donor atoms are present in the same molecule but at least there is separation of them from each other atom, then this type of ring is called 'keylet ring'
 keeleti karan se yogicon kaa sthayitv bahut bad jaataa he
 The five-member keylet rings are the most permanent
 chaar yaa chha: sadsy vaale keelet valay bhi saralata se ban jate hai
 This effect is clearly seen in organic amino-compounds
 monomethil amin kadachit hi upasahsanyojak-yogic banataa he, par ethilin diomin badi saralata se upasahsanyojak-yogic banataa he, jo bahut sthaayee hota he
 The normal secondary amine is rarely a subcomponent-compound, but the diethylene triamine readily combines with both heavy nitrogen ions with both nitrogens, forming a very stable bicylate ring
 alpha-amina amla anek dhaatuon ke hydroxidon se adhik kriya kar bahut sthaayee yogic banaata he
 In this, both the acid and amino groups combine with the metal to form a chelate ring
 yadi upasahsanyojaktaa-sankhya bandhuta se duguni he, to aise yogic anyanit hote hai or inhen 'aantar lavan' kehete hai
 Such internal salts are also formed from some hydroxy acids and diketones
 aise yogic jal main aviley hone par, carbonic vilaayakon main viley hote hai
 They are also volatile in steam
 kachche chamade par chromium lavenon se charmshodhan main kuch aisi hi kriya chromium lavan or chamade ke polipeptidon ke bich hoti he
 Purification of skin is believed to be due to such internal salts
 upasahsanyojaktaa-yogicon main kai kism kii samavyawata pai gai he
 The inclusion of more importance in these is as follows: isaki aanvik sanrachana main saralatam sanrachana ke gunak hote hai
 Hexamine cobaltic hexanitro cobalt is a polymer of unselected trinitro amine cobalt
 nitrite aayan ke nitrogen or oxigen donon ke parmaanuon main asajhi electron hote hai, at: ye cobaltic aayan se do ritiyon se, ek oxigen dwaara or doosraa nitrogen dwaara, sambhddha ho sakate hai
 Two isobics nitrito-pentamin cobaltic chloride CI2 or nitro-pentamine Cobaltic Chloride Cl2 praapt hote hai
 It contains both positive and negative ions, but their distribution is of various types, such as and isamen donon ke sanghatan ek se hote hai, par vilyan main ye vibhinn yanon main viyojit hote hai
 Cobaltic bromopentamine sulfate SO4, sulfate ion k and cobaltic sulfato pentamine bromide, Br, give bromine ion
 yah samavyawata chromik chloride ke heksa-hydrate main dekhi jaati he
 One isomer is gray purple and two are green
 ek se silver nitrate vilyan dwaara chlorine teenon parmaanu kaa, duusare se keval do chlorine parmaanu kaa or tisare se keval ek chlorine parmaanu kaa, tatkaal avakshepan hota he
 The formulas of these three are as follows: Cl3; Cl2 H2O* Cohesion bonds are vector
 iskaaran upasahsanyojaktaa samooh centre sthit hote hai
 The platinum ion has four valencies on one plane
 at: iske yogic platinum diamin dychloride do rup main, sis rup or trens rup main, praapt hue hai
 They differ in color, solubility and chemical behavior
 aisa keval platinum ke saath hi nahin hota, anya dhaatuon, jaise pelladium, nikal, cadmium, paarad aadi ke saath bhi aisa dekha jaataa he
 If there are six cohesive groups and two of them are different from the other four groups, they can also have two forms, sis and trance
 dychloro-tetramin cobaltic chloride do roopon main paaya gaya he
 One is purple in color and the other is green
 upasahsanyojak yogic praayah jatil aayan hote hai
 Most of these aqueous solutions are not ionized and therefore do not have electrolytes
 kintu iske vipareet, platinum ke nimnlikhit upasahsanyojak yogic jal main viyojit hokar jatil aayan utpann karte hai
 Cl4 → 4+ + 4 Cl– Cl3 → 3+ + 3 Cl– Cl2 → 2+ + 2 Cl– Cl → + + Cl– k → k + + - K2 → 2 K+ + 2– There are several types of subcomponent-compounds
 inamen se kuch bade upyogi siddh hue hai
 Their use is increasing steadily
 baari dhaatuon ke aise hi sanmishra sianide vidyut lepan main kaam aate hai
 Many such compounds are pigments of importance
 prashian blue, haemoglobin, chlorophyl aadi aise hi varnak hai
 Some compounds, especially intermittent salts, are useful in identifying, separating and determining the quantity of metals

 sho kii kahani ek alag ladki, susheel, paarekh parivaar ke 51 wein bachche
 a road accident kills all the female members of the Parekh family except for Sushil's mother
 avani susheel ko janm detii he lekin mar jaati he
 The accident was planned by Leela, Kiran's mother, she wanted to take revenge on Mehl, Sushil's father, for rejecting his daughter Kiran
 vah mehul kii bacchee nahin chaahati thim
 The child finds four fathers in Dada ji, Mehul and two uncles who make him their world
 mehul susheel shubh paata he
 The Parekh family decides to move into a new life
 ve surat main chale gaye
 They try to escape from Leela
 chaar purush pyaar or dekhbhaal ke saath susheel ko uthaanaa shuru karte hai
 Leela is looking for Mehul
 vah abhi bhi apana badla puraa karne ke liye chahta he
 The show takes a leap of a few years
 susheel ko ek pyaara or shararti ladki ke rup main dekha jaataa he jo apane parivaar se bahut pyaar karata he
 Grandpa loves her very much
 vah lagaataar use kuch nariwad karne ke liye kahata he
 Sushil enjoys being calm like the men in his family
 vah apane janm ke baad se apane vyavhaar sikhte samay unke samaan vyavhaar karti he
 Leela decides to go to Surat
 vah nahin jaanata ki paarekh parivaar surat main rah rahaa he
 Others are the grandchildren of Satya Leela
 susheel or satya mandir main milte hai
 Their meeting becomes unpleasant
 susheel ne satya kaa peechha kiya
 He is hurt
 paarekh parivaar par badla lene kaa ek or kaaran lila vah us ladki ko nahin chhodana chaahati jisane apane pote ko chot pahunchaai he
 Leela works hard to catch Suhail
 vah nahin jaanata ki mehul ke bachche susheel abhi bhi jivit hai
 The Parekh family decides to relocate to Ahmedabad
 susheel ab bada ho gaya he
 She looks beautiful but behaves tomboy
 satya kaa parichay hota he
 He walks over a bridge and jumps into a river, while his friend tells him about the Dahi Handi competition
 satya in sabhi varshon main pratiyogita jeet rahaa he
 He becomes hypersensitive and takes late entry
 susheel ise kisi bhi samay sheersh par banane ke liye daudta he
 Sushil first reaches the Dahi Handi and succeeds in breaking it
 satya ko ek ladki ko apane record todane ko milti he
 He gets upset
 susheel nrity or uski jeet manaata he
 Sushil won the trophy, a statue that is considered very auspicious
 satya ne susheel se trophy chori karne kaa faisla kiya
 After the stolen trophy, Satya is happy with his grandmother
 lila ne susheel se nafrat kii or satya ke saath unki frenceship bhi nafrat kii
 Meanwhile, Satya again takes Sushil to the ceremony which makes Leela more furious
 satya lila se kahati he ki vah shart ke liye susheel ko prabhavit kar rahaa he or jald hi uske dil ko tod degaa
 Leela is happy to hear this because she does not like Sushil because Sushil has hurt Sathya
 vah susheel ke garv ko kam karne kii pratiksha kar rahi he
 Satya continues with his love drama and plays the game with Sushil, while he is really in love with Sushil
 iske alaava, susheel bhi unke liye bhaawanaaon ko viksit karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 Eventually, Sathya also changes his heart and decides to apologize to Sushil and take him on an ice cream date
 satya use apni yojana bataane ke liye kadi mehnat karata he
 Satya changes her mind and decides to tell the truth
 satya ne use bataaya ki use apane doston ke saath shart thi or vah use dil kii dhadkan se peedit karnaa chahta tha
 However, the truth of truth is not revealed to Sushil
 iske alaava, vah sab kuch susheel ko sweekaar karata he lekin susheel use dhyaan nahin detaa he or ek ladki ko bachaane ke liye daudta he, jo ek trek se maaraa jaataa he
 When she is hurt, Sushil saves the girl with her bravery
 satya susheel ke liye chintit ho jaati he or uske peeche daudti he
 Satya feels proud of him
 susheel abhi bhi satya kii shart se anjaan he
 Later, Satya again loses the courage to tell Sushil everything
 duusari taraf, suhel ko dandit karne ke liye lila kii shadyantr bhi vifal ho jaati he kyonki satya vahaan aati he or susheel bachaati he
 Whereas, Susheel doubts Satya and realizes that he is the one who is causing trouble for her
 duusari taraf, satya bhi susheel se pyaar main pad rahi he lekin iske bare main koi jaankaree nahin he
 Leela hates Sathya to come close to Sushil and does everything possible to make a distance between them but it gets him very close
 susheel or satya ke gathbandhan ke bare main baat karne ke liye mehul ne apana puraa saahas liya
 Also, Mehul states that Sushil and Satya are good friends and they are like each other
 lila ko pataa chalaa ki ve susheel ko maarane ke prayaas main asafal rahe or unhen badla lene kaa ek or mauka mila
 Furthermore, Kali learns that Sushil was a girl saved in her childhood and Lila was the person who attempted to kill Sushil
 mehul or anya ghar aane par lila ke faisle ke bare main chintit hai or lila susheel or satya ke prastaav ko sweekaar karti he
 Leela also pays Rasik's dues which were pending by Bakhe and Mehul
 duusari taraf, lila satya ko kiran kii maansik sthiti ke bare main bataati he or vah kahati he ki susheel ke pita mehul iske liye zimmedaar hai
 Sathya is mourned to learn this, while Leela asks her to marry Sushil to get revenge from Mehal's family
 satya ko kiran kii kahani seekhney main bahut bhaavnaatmak ho jaataa he
 Thus Sathya accepts Leela's plan to marry Sushil and Lett leave him
 lila ne satya or susheel kii sagaai kii vyavastha kii he
 They also start with music and everyone enjoys dancing to the tunes
 lila susheel ke khilaaf kuch yojana bana rahi he
 Sushil happily meets all the challenges given by Leela
 iske alaava, mehul ne apni beti ko dard main dekhakar ansu bahaae
 Whereas, Leela knew Sushil's weakness that she is afraid of dogs and thus she puts a dog bone in Sushil's gift plate
 susheel dar gaya or use phenk diya, jabaki satya susheel ke saath-saath uske pita par fat gaya
 Sushil feels bad and she asks Sathya to talk about her father
 baad main, sejal or dusron ne sthiti ko shant kar diya
 Leela now tries to scare Susheel with a knife
 susheel chintit ho jaataa he or vah phir se chillaati he
 Everyone will try to pacify Sushil but he will say that someone is doing it intentionally because she was scared of the bone and now the knife
 is prakaar susheel ke parivaar ne susheel ko khush karne ke liye aashcharyachakit kiya
 Leela is ready to trap Sushil in his plans and is very excited for the wedding
 lila khushi se nrity karti he or susheel or uske parivaar kaa bhavy swaagat karti he
 Sushil is not happy as Mehul has not reached this place yet
 susheel yah maanate hue rahata he ki mehul aaenge
 On the other hand, Leela makes the last plans to prove Sushil mad at the wedding
 susheel ko video recording bhi mili he jo jhaano galati se susheel bhejti he
 Sushil learns that it was not his horrors and that something is really sorry
 iske alaava, lila susheel ko gahane se bharaa uphaar kaa ek guchha detaa he or ek haar ke madhyam se susheel ko electrocute karne kii yojana bana rahaa he
 Meanwhile, Vishu has left his camera in Sathya's room and the entire conversation and video has come to Leela and Jhano's record
 kaali ko satya ke kamare main camera mil gaya
 Kali gets Leela's plan in the camera and she is shocked to see it
 kaali samajhati he ki lila susheel ko pareshaan kar rahi thi or is prakaar susheel ne shaadi kii rasmon main ajeeb vyavhaar kiya
 Kali also remembers Sushil's previous mishaps when Leela tried to kill him
 baad main, kaali ne lila se muqabla kiya or vah use bataati he ki vah apni yojanaon ko safal nahin hone degi
 Kali reveals that Sushil has been without his mother because of Leela
 duusari ore, lila chintit he ki kaali ne sach siikhaa he
 Leela tells her what she will do if she has no evidence against him
 kaali jhaano ke saath apni yojanaon ke bare main baat karne kii video recording dikhaati he
 Leela is shocked to see this
 kaali ne lila kii satya ko satya ko bataane kaa faisla kiya
 Also, Satya is fed up with this marriage drama and he decides to tell that he does not want to marry Sushil
 duusari taraf, lila aakhirkaar susheel bachaati he or kaali dwaara prakat hone ke liye apni khel yojanaon se bahut chintit he
 Thus Leela takes care of Sushil and takes him back home to marry Sathya
 iske alaava, susheel abhi bhi mehul ke liye chintit he or vah use dhundti rahati he
 And Bakhe eventually reveals the whole truth to Sushil about his past with Leela's family
 susheel apane pita ke bare main badi sadame seekhney main hogi
 Apart from this, he also reveals that Sathya has asked him to stay at home and attend their wedding
 is prakaar susheel ne satya kaa saamana karne kaa faisla kiya, jabaki vah use sunati he ki vah susheel se pyaar nahin karata he
 Later, Sushil is shocked to learn this and will shed tears
 is prakaar susheel is shaadi ko rokane kaa faisla karegaa
 Sushil agrees to marry Sathya only for her family, while after learning the whole truth she refuses to marry Sathya in the pavilion
 lila or satya kii yojanaayen phisalati hai kyonki susheel usase shaadi karne se inkaar kar detii he
 Satya and Sushil get married despite the ego struggle
 satya bataati he ki vah apane jivan ko barbaad kar degaa or vah bistar ko nasht kar degaa
 Sushil asks him to ruin it and he will ruin himself
 kaali camere laati he or lila use dhundne ke liye kahati he
 Kali begins to find evidence while he cannot be found
 flashbek dikhaaya gaya he jab kaali rasoi main thi or jhaano camere letaa he or video footage ko hataa detaa he
 Mehul learned the truth about truth
 mehul yah sunakar chaunk gaya, or use dil kaa daura padaa
 Sushil then learns about Leela's truth
 duusari taraf, lila is avasar ko lene kaa faisla karti he or susheel ko or adhik peedit banaati he
 Sushil challenges Leela to make Satya a better person
 iske alaava, lila or susheel chip ke liye ladaai main aate hai
 The two gear up to find the chip and the balloons start to burst while the last Sushil finds the chip
 satya susheel ko gubaare fatne main madad karata he or donon ek saath aankh lock pal saajha karte hai
 Sushil and Satya are getting closer by the day but Leela's bad influence keeps her away from Sushil
 duusari taraf, susheel is khel ko khatm karne kaa faisla karti he or lila ko har kisi ke saamne ujagar karti he
 Sushil plans to make Satya learn the reality of Leela and the wrong impression for her
 satya or susheel kaa bandhan dhire-dhire or majboot ho jayega jo lila sahan nahin karegaa
 Satya asks Sushil to leave his life
 baad main, susheel bura mahasoos karata he or vah jane kaa faisla karti he
 Sushil packs and arrives in auto
 is bich, satya khadaa tha or usne apni niraashaa ko hataa diya or kaha ki use aisa karnaa tha mehul paarekh lila ne use susheel se shaadi kar lee
 Satya accepts that he loves Sushil
 vah kahata he ki vah use bahut pyaar karata he
 Sushil is overwhelmed to hear this and she decides to stay back and make Satya a better person
 holi tyohaar main, satya or susheel ladakiyon or ladakon ke bich yuddh chunauti ke tag ke liye taiyaar ho rahe the
 Satya was cheating to win the match again and he was manipulating Sushil to lose him
 satya use udaan chumban detii he jabaki susheel satya ko dekhakar kho jaati he or vah rassi chhod rahi thi
 Sushil was falling into Satya's arms and lost the match
 satya kii team unki jeet par nrity karti he
 Sushil also recalled his past when Sathya cheated to win the trophy
 satya susheel ke saath holi khelti he or uske liye rang lagu karti he
 Leela is surprised that Sathya and Sushil are playing Holi in front of her
 susheel bhi satya par rang phenkata he or bhaag jaataa he
 Sushil is happy and he calls everyone saying that Satya played Holi
 lila krodhit hone par har koi satya ko rang lagu karata he
 Sushil questioned Satya about his work
 vah use vyapaar main shaamil hone ke liye kahati he
 Later, Sushil Satya's CV while Satya tells him that he can make his own
 susheel antat use vishwaas dilaataa he or vah apana sivi bananaa shuru kar detaa he
 Sushil helps Sathya and they both start developing a good bond
 lila ne susheel par dhyaan kendrit kiya tha or vah apane jivan ko barbaad kar rahi thi or use satya ke jivan se baahar phenkna chaahati thi
 On the other hand, Satya loves Sushil and he expresses it in anger
 lila kii yojana satya kii jindagi main ek or ladki ko laakar susheel ke vivaah ke jivan ko nasht karne kii he
 Leela plans to search the bride for Sathya and she takes her pictures for the matrimonial site
 lila ko iske liye susheel kii madad mili thi
 Leela acted innocently and asked Sushil to create a profile for her brother in the matrimonial site
 susheel bhi sivam ke liye profile taiyaar karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye hai
 Apart from this, Satya also created his CV with the help of Sushil
 duusari taraf, lila ko satya or susheel ke rishte ko todane or vaivaahik site par satya kii profil banane kii yojana banaai gai he
 In the end Satya decides to go on a job interview, which makes Sushil very happy
 satya ne susheel kii ore apni bhaawanaaon ko chupaaya
 In addition, Leela begins with her plans and prepares for her home
 sajaavat ke saath har koi uljhan main chhod diya jaataa he
 Leela tells everyone that they are looking for a bride for Shivam
 satya kii profile bahut sari ladakiyon dwaara dekhi jaati he
 Apart from this, Leela also arranged to welcome girls at home
 satya or susheel ne mana ki lila sivam ke liye dulhan dhund rahi he
 Shockingly a group of men bring a cupboard to the house and say that it is a parcel for the truth
 saumy ne almaari se apni pravishti banaai
 Also, Soumya enters the house and demands Leela to meet Sathya once
 jabaki, vah satya kii bahon main girti he
 Satya saves her, while Sushil comes there and thanks Satya for saving her daughter-in-law
 jab sule ne vishay badal diya or use apane kamare main le gaya to saumy uljhan main aa gaya
 Leela is happy to bring another girl in Satya's life
 saumy satya ke kareeb ho rahi thim
 Sushil and Satya are clueless about Leela's plan
 saumy ko har kisi ne sivam kii patni banane ke liye sweekaar kar liya he
 While neither of them is unaware of Leela's ugly intentions
 lila ne saumy ko sachai kaa khulaasa kiya or use susheel kii sah-patni hone ke liye kaha
 Soumya accepts his intentions as bad intentions
 saumy ne sivam ke prastaav ko bhi sweekaar kiya
 Sushil and his family agreed to Shivam and Soumya's engagement
 jabaki, saumya ke man main kuch or yojanaayen hai
 Soumya seduces Satya by asking for his help in getting ready for the ceremony
 satya apni bhaawanaaon par niyantran kho detaa he or saumy ke saath ghanishtha ho jaataa he
 Satya starts attracting Soumya and he gets close to her
 is bich, susheel saumy kii talash main aa rahi he kyonki har koi uske liye intazaar kar rahaa he
 Sushil gets a shocker when he reaches the room and Satya and Soumya are getting close with each other
 susheel is dard ko sahan nahin kar sakaa or vah krodh main jaati he
 Sushil bursts at the truth and she reveals that she cannot live with such a man
 susheel ghar chhodane ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he
 Sushil tells her father that she will not come to this house again
 uske baad use ek police consteble dwaara ladaaku didi se tulana kii gai jab usne ek ladki ko ek ladke se bachaaya jo use pareshaan kar rahaa tha
 She checks the internet to learn about fighter D
D
 but only realizes that she was a wrestler and has gone missing
 kaali use kushti seekhney ke liye didi ke ghar bhejti he or didi ne vahaan rahane kii anumati di or use use sikhaane kaa vaada kiya
 Meanwhile Soumya is growing very close with Satya but is caught red-handed by Kali, when she orders food but everyone betrays her by saying that she made it with her own hands
