 On May 7, 2007, ABC Entertainment overlord Stephen mcpherson announced Lost would have a "highly anticipated and shocking" finale with the 2009â2010 season
 mcfersan ke anusaar "hamen laga ki ek yahi rasta tha jisase lost ko ek uchit rachanaatmak nishkarsh mil saktaa tha "
 Beginning with the 2007â2008 season, the final 48th episode was to air as 16 episodes per season in season 3 and Lost was to conclude in season 6
 lekin lekhakon kii hadtaal ke kaaran satr 4 main 14 or satr 5 main 17 prakaran pradarshit hue
 Season 6 also had 17 episodes planned
 lekin 29 june ko yah ghoshnaa kii gai ki antim satr main ek ghanta atirikt hoga jisase prakaran kii sankhya 18 hogi
 According to executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse "lost has always been seen as a program that has a beginning, a middle and an end", and the announcement of its ending will make viewers "believe the story ends as intended" 
 lindelopha or kus ne kaha ki 2010 kii shrinkhalaa ke samaapan kii taarikh kaa nirnaayak hona "behad muktijnak tha" or isse shrinkhalaa ke centre ko phir se khojane main madad mili
 Lindelof said, "we're not stopping anymore
 " nirmaataaon kii yojana he ki lambe samay se chal rahe rahasyon kaa samaapan kar diya jaayegaa jisame he dhumrapaan rakshas kaa swabhaav, chaar anguuthe vaali tawarat kii akruti, satr 1 ke prakaran house of da rising san' main se adam or eve kii pahchaan or dharm samayik ke khatme ke baad bhi jari rahane kaa kaaran
 Lindelof also indicated that Walt's extraordinary abilities could be explained, although it may not require the character's direct involvement
 mathew fox ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki antim satr main jaik shefrd or jon loke ke kirdaar aamane saamne aayenge
 There is a third way of the last session in which both the timings will "unite" and "go straight together" which will not include any previews or anything else
 " unka yah bhi daawa kiya ki vah ekmaatr kalakaar he jinako shrinkhalaa kii samaapti pataa he, jabaki lindelopha ne yah spasht kiya he ki fox ko keval unke charitra se judi bate hi pataa hai
 During comic-who 2009, there were several news stories related to Season 6
 carlton kus ne kaha kii donon samaykram or aage ke drashyon ke satr kaa samaapan ho chukaa he or ve satr 6 se kuch alag kar rahe he
 According to Josh Holloway, his character Sauer will revert to its old form after the death of Juliet
 haalanki kus or lindelof kaa kahana he ki dharm initiative ab kaarykram main koi badi bhoomika nahin nibhaayega, unhone kaha he ki "dharm- michigan conection" satr 6 main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayega
 Lindelof says that producers have a direct hand in producing the promotional poster for season 6
 is poster ko pehali baar comic-koun par pradarshit kiya gaya
 There is some meaning of everything in the poster, he also mentioned the Abbey Road cover related to the poster
 satr 6 lost kaa pehla or ekmaatr satr hoga jisame koi bhi purvavlokan yaa aadhikarik prachaar saamagree jaise bhavishya ke prakaran kii jhalak or promo tasviren prakashit nahin hongi kyonki lost ke nirmaataaon ko lagata he ki pehle prakaran kaa ek bhi drishy khulaasa kar saktaa he
 According to Lindelof, "every scene of this program will be basically indicative of what we are doing this year and what we are doing this year is different from our other years of work"
 apane charitra ke vikaas ke saath lost ke prakarnon main kai rahasyamay tatva bhi shaamil he jinako vigyaan katha yaa alokik ghatnaon se sambandhit dikhaaya gaya he
 The creators of the series use these elements to compose the mythology of the series and form the basis of speculation from critics
 is kaarykram kii puranic tatwon main ek "rakshas" he jo dweep par ghumta he ; ek rahasyamayi gut jisko uttarajive "adars" ke naam se sambodhit karte he, ek dharm inishiative naamak sanghathan jinhone dweep par kai shodh ke thikaane bana rakhe he, ek ank kram jo kirdaaron ke bhoot, varttman va bhavishya main aksar dikhataa he or vyaktigat sambandh yaa paatro ke bich kii samakramikta jisase ve aksar anjaan hai
 The series is basically a complex and mysterious story that revolves around many unresolved questions
 lost ke lekhakon or kalakaaron, jo aksar apane prashansakon se online baatcheet karte he, se prosahit hokar darshakon or tivi aalochakon ne rahasyon ko jaanane kii koshish main vyapak siddhaton kii rachana kii he
 Theories mainly include the nature of the island, the origin of the 'monster' and "others", the meaning of the numerals and the reason for the accident and the escape of some passengers
 prashansakon ke bahut main se kuch saarvajanik siddhant kaarykram ke rachanakaaron dwaara charchit or asweekrut kare gaye, jisame sabase aam he ki oshiyaanik flite 815 ke uttarajive mrit he yaa phir nark main hai
 This was specifically ruled out by JJ Abramus
 iske alaava, lindelopha ne un atakalon ko nakaar diya he jinke anusaar antarikshayan yaa duusare grah ke vaasi dweep kii ghatnaon ko prabhavit karte hai yaa phir sab kuch kisi vyakti kii kalpana main ho rahaa he
 Carlton Cuse also rejected the theory that it is a reality TV show on the island and the cast are unaware
 or lindelopha ne is siddhant ko bhi kai baar kaarij kiya ki 'rakshas' ek robot he jaisaa maaikel crickton ke upanyaas pre main tha
 'however, it is important to note that earlier discredited theories, especially those related to the period of time, changed from rejection to inclusion in the series, so that other rejected theories might also be included in the play
 lost main anek aavarti tatv or roopankan he jo aam taur par kahani par koi sidhaa prabhaav nahin daalate hai, lekin is kaarykram kii saahitiyik or darshanik pahalu ko prastut karte hai
 These elements include the arrival of black and white colors, which reflect the dualism and status of the characters; And together, almost all of the characters primarily depict Kate's rebellion; Dysfunctional family situations depicted in the lives of almost all the main characters; Futuristic context, in which Desmond's stopping the end-of-the-world button and the Religion Initiative's goal is to change the standards of the Valenzetti equation and stop the end of humanity; Coincidence vs
 fate, evident by Locke's and Mr
 Echo's proximity, the conflict between science and faith, the war between Jack and Locke over leadership; And references to many literary works, including mention and discussion of particular novels
 isamen kai kirdaaron ke naamon se prasiddh aitihaasik vichaarkon or lekhakon kii ore ishaara kiya gaya he jaise jon loke ke rup main, or unke urf naam jeremi bentham, deniel rosau, desmund hum, juuliyat bark, mikhail bakunin, danniel farade, alois hawking, jorge minkovsky, richard alport or sharlett stepuls louis

 It organized demand and supply, marginal utility and cost of production
 marshall kii gananaa arthshaastra ke pramukh sansthaapakon main kii jaati he
 The credit for establishing economics as an independent intellectual discipline goes to Alfred Marshall
 1885 se pehle arthshaastra ek vishay ke rup main darshanashastra or itihaas ke paathyakram kaa ang hua karata tha
 Historians and philosophers were compelled to pursue their degrees
 marshall ne ise na keval ek swatantra sansthagat aadhaar diya, balki iske vaigyanik maanakon ko bhautikee or jeev vaigyanik staron tak uthaa diya
 Marshall's efforts came to fruition in 1903 when separate economics studies and degrees began at Cambridge University
 jaldi hi vishwa bhar ke anya academik sansthaanon ne arthshaastra ko ek pruthak anushaasan ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 Alfred Marshall is named a top ranking officer in the history of sociology for his achievement in setting many new ideas in economics and taking this discipline to a new level institutionally
 marshall ne aarthik dharanaon ko sahaj graaphon main anudit karke âdiagramatic iconomicsâ kaa sutarapaat kiya
 Marshall's quality was that he succeeded in making these graphical expressions of his assumptions a part of economic analysis
 unhone aarthik vigyaan ko vyavaharik banane kaa prayaas kiya taaki uski madad se sarkari adhikari, rajaneta or vyapaaree ahm faisale le saken
 In his famous work Principles of Economics, published in 1890, Alfred Marshall designed the neoclassical system by conducting a detailed analysis of demand and supply
 is lihaaz se unhen nioclasical arthshaastra ke sansthaapak kii sangya bhi di ja sakati he
 Born in a working-class area of london, Alfred Marshall's father was a clerk in the Bank of England
 saadhaaran parivaar ke hone ke baavjood unke pita ne apane bete ko acchhee shiksha dilaayi
 He wanted Marshall to study literature, but he was interested in mathematics
 apane chachaa aarthik madad se marshall ne cambridge vishvavidhyalay main ganit, darshanashastra or raajnneetik arthshaastra kii padhai kii
 Despite reading all the classical works of philosophy, he decided to specialize in economics
 kaha jaataa he ki garib bastiyon kii buree haalat dekh kar unhen laga ki arthshaastri ban kar ve garibi kii samasya par behatar vichaar kar payenge
 Marshall studied the markets separately, ignoring the effects they had on each other and produced the 'partial Equilibrium Analysis'
 unhone dikhaaya ki jab daam badhate hai to farmein bazaar main or zyaada jinson ko laati hai
 He called it the 'law of supply'
 jab keemten girti hai to upabhokta badi maatra main vastuen karidate hai
 This was the rule of demand in Marshall's eyes
 maang or aapurti kii yah kanchi na keval apni katar-byont ke zariye prayek vastu kaa daam tay karti he, balki uski utpaadit hone vaali maatra bhi isi ke zariye nirdhaarit hoti he
 In contrast to the demand-driven attitude of Jevons and the supply-driven attitude of Ricardo, Marshall asserts that both demand and supply together determine prices and production
 ve maanate the ki bazaar kii pratiyogita vaastavik keemton ko santulanavastha kii taraf le jaaegi
 If the prices are above the satisfaction, the producer will not be able to sell his goods and things will start accumulating in his warehouse
 tab use sandesh milegaa ki use daam giraane hi hai
 If the prices are kept below the equilibrium, then the goods will sell so much that the warehouses will become empty and there will be shortage
 vyapaaree ise daam badhaane ke sandesh ke rup main grahan karenge
 Marshall considered that this scissors of demand and supply was a tricky establishment
 isliye unhone iske donon falkon kaa alag-alag vishleshan bhi kiya
 He observed that demand is determined by the usefulness of a particular item and satisfaction derived from its consumption
 upabhokta lagaataar sarvaadhik upyogita kii khoj main rahata he
 If the price of a commodity is high, it will move towards other commodities in search of utility
 unhone maang main hone vaale parivartanon ko upabhoktaaon dwaara ek si keemat par kisi ek vastu ke zyaada yaa kam khride jane ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 If the demand curve changes, the reason can be traced to many other changes: changes in the level of prosperity, changes in population, changes in people's interests, fluctuations in prices of other commodities, or future prices
 Expectations is lihaaz se zyaada samruddhi or badi hui aabaadi maang badhaayegi or keemten upar jaayengi
 The possibility of price rise in future can also increase demand
 duusari chizon ke daam badhane se kisi chiz kii maang par padane vaale asar kii vyakhya marshall ne poorak vastuon kii dharna kaa istemaal karke kii
 For example, if the price of gasoline increases, the demand for things related to it will also fall
 marshall ne dikhaaya ki kis tarah aapurti utpaadan kii laagat par nirbhar karti he
 If the consumer is looking for utility and satisfaction then the producer is looking to maximize profits
 yadi paimaane ke ghatate hue pratfal kaa niyam lagu kiya jaae or kal-purzon or shram kii keemten bad rahi hon to utpaadan kii laagat bhi badhati he
 It is obvious that if traders do not get better prices then they will not be ready to produce more goods
 duusare, utpaadan kitna bhi zyaada ho rahaa ho, agar mazaduri aisi sthiti main utpaadakon ko keemten bhi badhaani padengi
 But if the technology gets better and the labor cost per unit is less then the supply will also increase and the prices will also be lower
 adhiktar aarthik sambandh kaary-kaaran se bandhe hote hai
 Marshall developed the notion of elasticity or elasticity in this regard
 agar kisi kaaran yaa ghatana kaa prabhaav bahut bada padataa he to vah sambandh elastic mana jayega or agar kam padataa he to inilastic 
 Marshall also introduced a mathematical formula for measuring elasticity
 unka maananaa tha ki agar kisi vastu kaa vikalp nahin he or upabhokta uski jagah kisi duusari kaa istemaal nahin kar saktaa to vah vastu keemton ke lihaaz se inilastic rahegi
 Even after the price increases, its sales will not decrease
 marshall ne yah bhi dikhaaya ki maang kii elasticity kis tarah daamon par nirbhar karti he
 The price of a packet of salt is very low, so even if there is a big change in its prices, the salt consumers will not feel so high that their demand will be affected
 lekin agar car ke daamon main yaa college kii fis main vruddhi ho jaae to upabhoktaaon ko dikkat hone lagegi
 Marshall also noted the role of time in determining elasticity of demand
 jo maang aaj elastic nahin he yani daam badhane par bhi kam nahin ho rahi he, vah kal elastic ho sakati he
 For example, cars did not start selling less even when petrol was expensive
 par aage chal kam eendhan main adhik chalane vaali kaaren baniin, logon ne car-pool kerani shuru kii
 This made a difference on the demand for petrol
 dilachasp baat yah he ki arthshaastra ko nitishastra or itihaas se alag karne vaale is vidwaan ko aay ke vitaran or garibi kii samasya main kaafii ruchi thi
 He also studied the labor market in which the businessman is a consumer, demands and supplies society and family
 marshall ne dekha ki agar mazaduri bad jaae to akushal mazaduron kii supplai bad jaati he, par praudyogiki behatar hone se akushal shram kii maang lagaataar girti he
 This makes the unskilled laborers desirous of living in poverty due to low wages
 khaas baat yah he ki is nishkarsh par pahunchne ke baavjood marshall ne na to nunatam mazaduri badhaane kii sifaarish kii or na hi garibi kam karne ke liye koi suzav diya
 He only suggested that unskilled laborers should limit their family size
 marshall zyaadaatar yogadan microiconomic kism kaa he, par unhone kuch macroiconomic yogadan bhi kiya he
 Purchasing power parity is one such principle under which the exchange rate of currency between two countries is fixed at the market level
 masalan, agar ek burgers america main ek dollar main bikta he or japan main sau yen main to bazaar main ek dollar or sau yen kii krayshakti baraabar hui, bhale hi mudra bazaar main ek dollar das yen ke baraabar mana jaataa rahe
 The first criticism of Marshall's study of markets is that they ignored the effect of one market on each other, so they only reached the principle of partial equilibrium
 jabaki leone walrus ne bazaaron ke antarsambandhon kaa adhyayan kiya or saamaanya santulanavastha kaa siddhant pratipaadit karne main safal rahe
 Marshall's study of the causes of poverty is also viewed critically, as he does not recommend raising the minimum wage of unskilled workers
 arthshaastra ko swatantra sansthagat aadhaar dene ke liye unki prashansa to kii jaati he, par saath hi yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki darshan, naitikta or saamaajik sarokaaron se aarthik vigyaan ko alag karne ke parinaam thomas karlile kii bhashaa main use uttarottar ek âmanahuus vigyaanâ banane kii taraf le gayi

 Showed the common Indian a dream of a hefty salary and a comfortable life

 The social status of the person joining Satyam used to increase itself
 1987 se yatra aarambh karne ke baad satyam sheeghra hi desh kii chauthi sabase badi iti company ban gai
 This development astonished the eyes of IT giants around the world and people started praising Satyam
 lekin yah sab baad main ek chhalaava siddh hua jab yah paaya gaya kii company ke maalik ramalinga raju ne company ke laabh ko varshon tak badha-chadha kar prastut kiya tha
 Ramalinga Raju used to present the profit of the company exaggerated every year
 lekin is pragati kaa raaj 7 janvari 2009 ko logon ke saamne aa gaya, jab company ke sansthaapak or chayaraman raju ne apana pad parityag kar diya
 In his letter to the Board of Directors and SEBI, he wrote that the financial condition of the company has been deteriorating over the years
 bazaar main company kii pratishtha banaae rakhane ke liye varsh prati varsh unhone company ko laabh main dikhaaya
 For which the accounts of the company were manipulated
 udhar, company ke share main promotaron kii bhagidaari lagaataar ghatati chali gai
 Due to which the danger of opening the secret of the company was posed
 or isse bachane ke liye unhone apane putr kii swaamitv vaali company metas ke adhigrahan kaa nirnay liya
 He said that he did everything possible to get Satyam out of the crisis, but despite all his efforts Satyam's condition continued to deteriorate
 raju ne kaha, "yah baagh kii sawari karne jaisaa he, yah jane bina ki uskaa aahaar banane se kaise bachaa jaay"
 He wrote that he is guilty and ready to submit himself to the law and now he is ready to bear every consequence
 iske baad jo kuch hua sabake saamne he
 He relinquished his post, writing letters to the board of directors of Satyam and SEBI
 jis samay unhone apane pad parityag kiya, us samay satyam ke ek share kaa mulya 188 rou tha
 But by the evening, its value had reduced to forty rupees
 duusare din yah mulya maatr 6
25 paise ke nunatam str par aa gaya
 This led to a loss of about Rs 100 billion to investors in the company
 company kii sthiti ab sabake saamne he
 Investors lost their trust in the company
 unke karmchaariyon ko sadak par aane kaa dar sataane laga he
 On the other hand, KPMG, an organization that maintains accounts of companies such as Wipro and Infosys, says that Ramalinga Raju alone is not responsible for the scandal in the company, the company's chief executive officer Recharya Reiki said that all this is beyond logic
 koi nahin kah saktaa he ki is patr main jo kuch likhaa gaya he, vah sab kaa sab sahi hi he
 It is not right to believe that Raju alone is responsible for whatever happened
 balki khaaton ke sanchaalan se jude tamaam logon ko saamne laane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The trouble with the company actually began when on December 16, 2008, the board of directors of Satyam Computers convened a meeting and passed a resolution to acquire Maytas Infrastructure and Maytas Properties, a company owned by Ramling Raju's sons
 is adhigrahan ke peeche tark diya gaya ki mandi ke is daur main vartmaan vikasdar banaae rakhana asambhav he
 The fall in the Indian currency compared to foreign currencies created tremendous pressure
 bazaar ke jin kshetron main ab tak vikaas dekha ja rahaa tha, wo mandi kii maar se buree tarah prabhavit the
 Also, the attitude that the US government has adopted regarding out-sourcing, may add further trouble in the coming years
 aise main iti ke alaava aadharbhoot dhaancha, urja, aadi kshetron main nivesh karke company ke vikaas dar ko banaae rakhaa ja saktaa he
 It was informed in the meeting that India will spend five hundred billion dollars, while China will spend seven and a half hundred billion dollars on the development of its infrastructure in the next five years
 is drushti se aadharbhoot dhaancha kshetra main nivesh karnaa laabhakaari siddh ho saktaa he
 With these arguments, the Satyam board of directors decided to acquire Maytas for Rs 79
141 billion
 pehle hi mandi kii maar se jujh real state main nivesh karnaa satyam ke niveshkon ko sweekaar nahin tha or unhone satyam nideshkamandal mandal ke is nirnay kaa virodh kiya
 People wondered why Satyam decided to jump into the real estate sector
 nirnay par is baat ko lekar bhi aapatti thi ki aakhir satyam ke chairman raju ke bete kii company main hi nivesh kaa nirnay kyon liya gaya
 Raju replied to this in his letter that he did this to get Satyam out of tightness
 metas ke adhigrahan se company ko jo laabh hota usase vah apane ghate kii bharpai karti or metas kii dendaree se baad main nipatati
 But the opposition from investors made all the jaggery dung
 or adhigrahan kaa nirnay taalna padaa
 Raju, who is suffering from the grudge in the whole case, finally decides to reveal the truth
 sach saamne aate hi satyam par shikanja kasne laga
 The chairman of Satyam had to endure the jailbreak
 sebi ne satyam ke sheyaron par pratibandh laga diya
 On the other hand, Satyam shares were also banned on the New York Stock Exchange
 satyam par darjanon maamle darj karaae gaye
 The government set up a three-member committee to look after the functioning of Satyam

 That is, the government will give salary to the employees for three months at the rate of 5
2 billion rupees every month
 desh main karodon log berozegaar hai, lakhon log roj sadakon par aa rahe hai, sarkaar ko in logon kii chintaa kyon nahin he
 After all, why did the government worry about those Satyam employees who are getting at least fifty thousand rupees monthly salary
 kya isliye ki wo chaiyn kaa jivan jeene ke aadi ho chuke hai or ab tangi kaa jivan nahin ji sakate
 Why did the Congress government not worry about the four million people trapped in Bihar, they were completely ruined

 Indian citizens also know that the government has spent even those money which Satyam never earned, after all, where the government has slept till now
 use kyon nahin pataa chalaa ki satyam ke laabh kaa chittha puri tarah jhooth kaa pulinda he
 How long will she sleep

 Why doesn't she get the accounts of industry houses checked

 How the bankers who did not fail to adopt every gimmick to recover debt from poor farmers, gave wrong entry to Satyam for years
 ab bhi sudharne kaa samay he
 Something needs to be done on the concrete surface to come out of the growth figures

 On the advice of Sushim, King Bindusagar sent Prince Ashok to demolish the uprising of rebels
 ashok ke aane kii khabar sunakar hi vidrohiyon ne updrav khatm kar diya or vidroh bina kisi yuddh ke khatm ho gaya
 Although the rebellion here once again took place during the reign of Ashoka, this time he was crushed by force

 He put Ashoka in exile by saying to Emperor Bindusara

 Meanwhile, there was a rebellion in Ujjain
 ashok ko samraat bindusaar ne nirvaasan se bula vidroh ko dabaane ke liye bhej diya
 Although his generals suppressed the rebellion, his identity was kept secret as his brother Sushim feared to be killed after he came to know about it by a spy trap spread by the Mauryas

 During this time he came to know Buddhist laws and teachings
 yahan par ek sundari, jiskaa naam devi tha, usase ashok ko prem ho gaya

 barason ke adhyayan ke baad jab 1916 main albert oinstin ne is siddhant kii ghoshnaa kii to vigyaan kii duniya main tahalaka much gaya or dhai-sau saal se qaayam ijak newton dwaara 1687 main ghoshit brahmand kaa nazariyaa hameshaa ke liye ulat diya gaya
 It had such a profound effect on physics that people began to describe modern physics as a subject different from classical physics and Albert Einstein came to be considered the father of modern physics
 dik sanskrit kaa shabd he jiskaa arth he ird-gird kii jagah
 It is called "space" in English
 manushya dik ke teen pahaluon ko bhaap sakane kii kshamta rakhte hai- upar-neeche, aage-peeche or daayen-baayein
 In ordinary life, humans do not see any change in problems
 newton kii bhautikee kahati thi ki agar antariksh main do vastuen ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hai or un donon main se koi bhi na hile, to ve ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hi rahengi
 Our ordinary life also shows us this
 lekin inastin ne kaha ki aisa nahin he
 The problem may worsen and shrink
 aisa bhi sambhav he ki jo do vastuen ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hai ve swayan na hilen, lekin unke bich kaa dik kuch paristhitiyon ke kaaran fail kar sava kilometre ho jaae yaa sikud ke pauna kilometre ho jaae
 In Newton's classical physics, it was said that the speed of time is the same everywhere in the universe
 agar aap ek jagah tik kar baithe hai or aapkaa koi mitra prakaash se aadhi gati kii raftaar par das saal kaa safar tay kare to, us safar ke baad, aapke bhi das saal guzar chuke honge or aapke dost ke bhi
 But Einstein also said that this belief is wrong
 jab koi chiz gati se chalati he, uske liye samay dhire ho jaataa he or vah jitna tej chalati he, samay utana hi dhire ho jaataa he
 If your friend returned by traveling at half the speed of light for ten years according to his own, then ten years would have passed but eleven and a half years would have passed
 inastin ne saapekshata siddhant main dikhaaya ki vastav main dik ke teen or kaal kaa ek milakar brahmand main chaar pahaluon vaala dik-kaal he jisame sari vasteen or urjaayen sthit hotin hai
 This problem is not permanent - neither problem occurs without any change and it is not necessary that the flow of time is the same for every thing
 dik-kaal ko prabhavit kar ke use maroda, khinchaa or sikoda ja saktaa he or aisa hi brahmand main hota he
 The concept of time travel has been created through this principle
 dik-kaal main badlaav har vastu or har raftaar paidaa karti he lekin badi vasteen or prakaash ke sameep kii raftaarein adhik badlaav paidaa karti hai
 Humans are so small and their speed is so slow that they do not see the effects of the theory of relativity in their lives, but when they study more things in the universe, they find signs of relativity in many places
 jab vastu kaa veg prakaash ke veg kaa 5% bhi ho jaae, to saapekshata ke siddhanth ke chinh hame dikhaai dene lagate he
 Newton believed that every object had a force to pull towards itself, which he called gravity
 prithvi jaisi badi chiz main yah gurutvkarshan bahut adhik hota he, jisase ham prithvi se chipke rahete hai or anayas hi ud kar antariksh main nahin chale jate
 But Newton could not explain how the force of gravity actually works and why
 inastin ne kaha ki aapekshikta ke siddhanth ke anusaar yah vichaar ki bhautik vastuen ek doosar ko aakarshith karti hai, ek bhram he, jo prakruti sambandhi galat yantrik dharanaon ke kaaran paidaa hua he
 He said that the earth is large and because of that the time period around him has turned and folded over itself
 ham is khiche-mude dik-kaal main rahete hai or is mudan kii vajah se prithvi ke qareeb dhakele jate hai
 This can be compared to a sheet whose four corners have been pulled by four people
 ab is chadar ke bich main ek baari gola rakh diya jaae, to chadar bich se baith jaaegi, yani uske soot main bich main mudan paidaa ho jaaegi
 Now if we place a light ball on the corner of the sheet, it will roll towards the big circle
 inastin ne kaha ki koi anaadi aadmi yah dekh kar kah saktaa he ki choti gend ko bade gole ne khinchaa isliye gend uske paas gai
 But the real reason was that the ball wanted to go towards the ground and the shell created such a twist in the sheet that the ball went to him
 isi tarah se unhone kaha ki yah ek mithyaa he ki gurutvkarshan kisi aakarshan kii vajah se hota he
 The real reason for gravity is that every object which is moving in space, comes under the influence of such a problem of difficulty and starts moving towards something bigger
 vastut: gurutvkarshan jadta kaa ek bhaag maatr he, taare or grahon kii gatividhiyaan, unke swabhaavgat jadtv se utpann hotin hai or unka maarg dik-kaal-satati ke vrittiya tatwon par nirbhar karata he
 Just as there is a magnetic field around the magnet, the celestial object scatters a field in the sky around it
 jis tarah chumbakeey kshetra main ek lohe ke tukade kii gatividhi kshetra kii banaavat se nirdeshit hoti he usee tarah gurutveey kshetra main kisi vastu kaa maarg us kshetra kii jyamithik avasthaa se nirdhaarit hota he
 Einstein's law of gravitation gives information about the regional elements of the time constant
 mukhyat: is niyam kaa ek bhaag gurutvkarshanjanya vastu ke chaaron ore ke kshetra ke dhaanche se sambandh vyakt karata he
 a great proof of Einstein's spreading theory came from seeing the effect of gravity on light
 newton kii bhautikee main siddhant tha ki do vasteen ek-duusare ko donon ke dravyaman ke anusaar khinchati hai
 But there is no mass of light, that is, zero
 to newton ke mutabiq jis chiz kaa koi dravyaman yaa vazan hi nahin uskaa kisi duusari vastu ke gurutvkarshan se khichne kaa sawaal hi nahin banataa chaahe duusari vastu kitni bhi badi kyon na ho
 Light always moves in a straight line
 lekin agar inastin sahi he or kisi badi vastu kii vajah se dik hi mud jaae, to roshni bhi dik ke mudane ke saath mud jaani chahie
 That is, large objects located in the universe should act as lenses - just as the lens of glasses, binoculars or microscope turns light, the stars and planets should also bend
 1924 main ek orest khwolson naam ke roosi bhautikavigyaani ne inastin ke saapekshata siddhant ko samajhakar bhavishyavaanee kii ki aise gurutvkarshak lens brahmand main zarur honge
 Fifty-five years later, this was first noticed in 1979 when two images were seen, instead of one, of an object called twin quasars
 uske baad kaafii dur-daraaj vastuon kii aisi chhaviyaan dekhi ja chuki hai jinamein un vastuon or prithvi ke bich koi bahut badi anya vastu rakhi ho jo pehali vastu se aa rahi prakaash kii kirnon par lenson kaa kaam kare or uski chhavi ko yaa to marod de yaa aasmaan main uski ek se zyaada chhavi dikhaae

 Footnote uddhran The history of the theater in Europe is usually around 3,200 BC
 Starts with is kaal ke pracheen misr main kai prakaar ke naatak mili hai
 There are 55 pyramid plays in them, and there are many plays related to the throne, festival
 ek ayurveda sambadhi naatak bhi mila he
 The most ancient pyramid play, found on the walls of the fifth and sixth royal tombs, is inscribed
 inako dekhne se aisa gyaat hota he ki inke kuch bhaag praaia: i
pus
 4000 varsh ke aasapaas ke hai
 The names of the characters are not written before their narrative - the characters themselves say "I am a nut", "I am Horus
" " in naatakon main paatr pashu pakshiyon ke chehre vyavhaar kiya karte the, aisa anumaan hota he
 Often these plays were played by priests living near these tombs
 in naatakon ke vyay ke hetu pharaaon ke dwaara kuch nidhi alag kii jaati thi
 Often these plays were played in the tombs or temples of the king built near the Mahatwa
 inamen likhe mahatva ke paas bane hue raja ke mandiron main khele jate the
 The instructions written in these shows that from where the characters entered the theater, what used to be there, etc
 is prakaar ke daire el baheri ke mandir ke nakshe kaa punaruddhar bhi kiya gaya he
 On seeing this, it is known that these temples were built on many floors and were often deformed
 ek pashaan par utkeern naatak main naatyashaala main paatro kaa pravesh kaise ho yah bhi dikhaane kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 It is called Shabka Stone
 josar ke pyramid main naatyashaala kaa ek chitra mila he jisamen lapete hue parde ko bhi pradarshit kiya gaya he
 Often these plays were played in pillars-based verandahs
 pujari log jo jaanwaron kaa cheharaa pahante the uskaa bhi darshan hamen ek chitra main hota he
 Plays in Greece began with the worship of the god Dinosus
 ho saktaa he ki yahan ke praarambhik naatakon par mistra kaa prabhaav padaa ho kyonki dianosus kaa tyohaar manaane kii pratha herrodotus ke anusaar mistra main prarambh hui or peeche attika main bhi yah manaaya jane laga
 Evidence of Greek plays being played in Syria often dates back to 1250 BCE
 ye naatak raas shamara main do khapadon par ankit mili hai
 The practice of playing plays from Egypt through Syria may have reached Greece
 dianosus ke ye tyohaar varsh main chaar baar manaae jate the
 The first was in the month of December and January, the second Poseidon Mass, the second take was in the month of Gamalion in late January and early February, the third was in late February and early March) and the fourth was the most prominent
 It used to fall in late March and early April
 yah elafebalion kaha jaataa tha
 The first play, which is found, is sad
 vah yunaan main praaia: 534 i
pus
 main khelaa gaya tha
 Like India, plays were also performed in the first place in Greece
 uske pashchaat maidan main hone lage
 They used to go on for many days
 is kaal main paatro ke munh par safed pisa hua jasta lagaaya jaataa tha tathaa munh par chitrakaari bhi kii jaati thi
 Thespis first carried on the practice of pretending to put clothes on their face
 iske kaaran paatro ko apni veshbhusha ko prayek baar badalane kii avashyaktaa nahin hoti thi
 Coerilus first made the faces of women
 praaia: in naatakon main cathopakathan kaa hi mahatv hota tha
 Esquilus first fixed the costumes of his characters, made them wear high shoes and raised their height and also enlarged their faces
 isi ne naatyashaalaaon ko sundar banane ke hetu inamen chitron ko lagavaana prarambh karaayaa tathaa kuch kalpurje bhi lagaae, tathaa ek sthaan par do paatro ko isane rangamanch par ek saath pravesh karaayaa
 During this period, staircase auditoriums were also built around the Greek theater

 Property has been used by Eastern and Western societies as an essential item for social organization and social living
 sampatti shabd kaa aashay, isse sambandhit anya vichaaron se, jinhen "vastu" yaa "res", "domus" tathaa "swami" aadi shabdon se vyakt kiya gaya, viksit hua
 According to linguistics the term property is derived from the Latin adverb "possessor"
 iskaa vikaas "proprirts" naamak shabd se hua
 The word proprietis came to be used on an intellectual level by Roman legalists and was used in the colloquial language of France
 dhire dhire sampatti shabd kaa upyog bhoomi, dhan tathaa anya moolyawaan vastuon ke liye hone laga
 The meaning of the word "property" is definite when the term came to be used to express the relation of a family and objects belonging to its members
 baad main saamaajik paristhitiyon dwaara vyaktiyon kii vastuon ke abhigrahan or sangrakshan kii pravriti ko manyata praapt hui tathaa uske mul kaa auchity or aavashyaktaa dekhte hue sampatti kaa samarthan kiya jane laga
 It became an object of respect and its development started as an institution with social specialties
 aadim samaaj main dharm ke adhikari vidwaanon ne kanoon ko janm diya tathaa us samaaj main sampatti evam parivaar donon aviyojya shabd the kyonki donon kaa mul dharm hi tha tathaa donon ko dharm se hi manyata praapt thi
 Thus property, family and law were homogeneous or related terms in primitive society
 sanskrit shabd "grih" arthath ghar kii vyutpatti, "grah" shabd hui he jiske arth he, le lenaa, sweekaar karnaa, chin lenaa athwa vijay praapt karnaa
 It should be remembered that acquisition by winning by force or in war is a very ancient method
 manu ke anusaar, grih kii sthapana gruhasthi yaa parivaar kii neenv he
 The Latin word "domus", used for both "home" and "family", has its origin in "dominium", which in Roman jurisprudence is very important for explaining the meaning of property
 nyaaysanhita main "mensipium", "dominium" tathaa "propierts" kaa prayog sampatti athwa "swaamitv" ke liye samaan rup se kiya jaataa he
 Mancipium means acquisition, possession, especially land
 "mainsipium" shabd lagbhag sanskrit ke "grah" shabd ke hi samaan he
 In Roman, "dominium" or "propiratus" refers to a set of rights that signify ownership
 samay ke saath saath "swatv" kaa vikaas hua or dhire dhire iskaa aashay kisi vastu kaa swatantra upyog or use bhejne yaa de daalane kaa adhikaar samajha jane laga
 Religious feelings were also associated with property in primitive societies
 jahaan bhoomi or uske utpaadan jeevika ke pramukh saadhan the tathaa bhoomi abhigrahan kii vidhi atikaraman or vijay dwaara praapt karnaa tha, bhoomi tathaa kheti karne kaa adhikaar ek prakaar kaa dhan samajha jaataa tha or is prakaar yah ek jati athwa parivaar se sambadhit sampatti kaa pramukh ang tha
 Family property was only eligible for those who performed religious rituals for their ancestors
 purvajon ke liye dharmik anushthan karnaa nar vanshajon kaa hi pratham kartavya samajha jaataa tha
 Therefore, the right to cultivate, enjoy the land and purchase and sell it was obtained from birth
 putr kaa janmat: adhikaar mitakshra ne sweekaar kiya he
 According to Vijaneswar, birth is the cause of wealth
 hindu samaaj main kanoon kii yah nishchit sthiti he ki paitruk yaa purvajon kii sampatti kaa swatv janm se praapt hota he
 Gradually, the religious form of property disappeared
 mitakshra ke anusaar sampatti ihloki vastu he kyonki iskaa upyog sansaarik len dein ke liye hota he
 According to the commentators of Manusmriti, the meaning of property in the Aryans was related to the whole family, which included sons, daughters, wife and slaves
 samaaj ke vikaas ke saath putr, putree tathaa patni ko sampatti kii vastu yaa sampatti kaa ang na samajhakar unhen sampatti se pruthak astitv kii manyata di gai
 The legal suffix of flat in Indian law is the same as in English jurisprudence
 angreji kanoon bahut kuch roman kanoon se prabhavit he
 The word "property" can have many meanings, such as ownership or ownership, that is, the complete right of the owner
 kabhi kabhi iskaa arth roman "res" hota he jise antargat swaamitv ke adhikaar kaa prayog hota he jiske antargat swaamitv ke adhikaar kaa prayog hota he arthath swayan vah vastu jo ukt adhikaar kaa vishay yaa paatr he
 The human meaning of "race" or "object" has helped in the development of the nature of property
 is prakaar "res" athwa "vastu" par adhikaar kaa sambodh or swayan "res" yaa "vastu" kaa sambodh sapatti sambandhi pratyay se jatil tathaa gahare rup se sambhddha he arthath donon ek duusare ke poorak or sahaayak he
 The meaning of "race" in Roman is extremely complex
 yah angreji kii tarah adhikaar kii thos vastu he
 But "race" is not exactly the same meaning as "object", it is more than that
 yadhyapi "res" kaa mul arth bhautik vastu he, parantu dhire dhire iskaa prayog aisi parisampatti ko vyakt karne ke liye bhi hone laga jo bhautik tathaa sthool hi na hokar amoort bhi ho sakati thi jaise bijli
 "race" is also used for exclusive rights and also for rights that arise, for example, from fame or fame
 is prakaar in do artho ke liye res kaa lagaataar prayog hone ke kaaran "res" ke do arth ho gaye : "res parthiv" arthath bhautik vastuen jo manushya ke adhikaron ke antargat aa sakati he tathaa "res aparthiv" arthath ve adhikaar swayan
 Thus, as a result of the final analysis, "object" will be taken to mean "race earth"
 roman bhashaa main "res" sampatti kii vastu tathaa adhikaar donon ke liye prayukt hota he, parantu "bona" shabd, jo saamaan yaa dhan ke liye prayukt hota he, sanskrit ke "dhan" shabd ke samakaksh he
 According to Arabic jurors the word "goods" can be used for property and any thing which has value or meaning in Arabic law or which can be in the possession of a person
 "dhan" shabd bhi sampatti ke liye bahudhaa prayukt hota he
 The object to be used in the sense of property must have the qualities of stability and physical unity
 ikaayiyon ke ek sangrah ko jisaki ikaiyaan swayan pruthak vastu hon or aisi ekal ikaayiyon ke sammilan se bani vastu ko bhi vastu kah sakate hai; jaise ek eent athwa eenton se nirmit ek makaan yaa ek bhend athwa kai bhedon se bana ek jhuden
 In law, the object is also used to express certain rights and duties
 bhautik gunon ke aadhaar par "vastu" do prakaar kii ho sakati he - chal athwa achal
 But according to the technical rules of English law, things are real and personal
 roman kanoon ke anusaar "res" ko isi prakaar "maincipebul" tathaa anamancipubul main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 In this way property is related to another "race" or "object" and on the other hand to human rights related to race or object
 isliye sampatti ke liye ek aisa vyakti aavashyak he jo kisi vastu par apana adhikaar rakh sake
 Property, according to the final analysis, expresses the relationship established between a person and an object or right, which he considers only his own
 apane aadhunik prayogon main sampatti un sabhi vastuon yaa sampada ke liye prayukt hoti he jo kisi vyakti se sambandhit ho yaa us vyakti ne kisi anya ko samarpit kar diya ho parantu apane laabh ke liye us vastu kii vyavastha karne kaa adhikaar surakshit rakhata ho
 The classification of property according to the nature of the race or object and the nature of the object or rights are classified in various ways, eg, earthly or non-living; Movable or immovable and real or personal
 sampatti ke saath anya vishisht shabdon jaise vyaktigat yaa saarvajanik, paitruk, daayayogy, sanyukt paariwarik, samadhikarik aadi ke sanyukt kar dene se sampatti ke swaroop ke saath sambandh vyakt hota he
 According to the statutory interpretation of property it has many meanings
 sampatti ke antargat kisi vyakti ke dwaara kiye gaye shaareerik tathaa maansik parishram ke fal bhi aate hai
 Any person gets whatever he gets in exchange for something he is given and whatever is considered by the law or given the right to use, enjoy and arrange it, All is called that person's personal property
 parantu kanoon dwaara manyata na praapt hone par use sampatti nahin kaha ja saktaa or tab vidhik parinaam kii drushti se vyakti or vastu ke bich koi sambandh nahin rah jaataa he
 Vasudha is a Hindi literary magazine
 iske sansthaapak sampadak harishankar parasaai the
 Its publication started monthly, but later it has been published quarterly
 iskaa prakaashan 'pragatisheel lekhak sangh' kii 'madhya pradesh ikai' ke dwaara hota he
 The issue was named Progressive Vasudha from issue-63
 yah bhopal se prakashit hoti he
 Monthly publication of 'vasudha' started in 1956
 iske sansthaapak sampadak the harishankar parasaai
 He used to edit it with the help of some of his friends
 do varsh evam kuch maheene baad iskaa prakaashan sthagit ho gaya
 Then about three decades later, in the ninth decade its second frequency occurred
 madhyapradesh pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke adhyaksh ke naate parasaai ji pradhan sampadak hue or unhone ek team taiyaar kii
 The team has been changing according to the internal decision of the Progressive Writers Association to edit this magazine
 kamala prasad ji ke pradhan sampadakatv main yah patrika lambey samay tak tremasik rup main prakashit hoti rahi he
 It has been published by the Madhya Pradesh Progressive Writers Association
 patrika ke prakaashan kii dwitiya aavriti main ank-62 tak to iskaa naam 'vasudha' hi rahaa, lekin ank-63 se naye roopakar main iskaa prakaashan aarambh hua or iskaa naam 'pragatisheel vasudha' ho gaya
 The numbers were numbered, but the identity of the magazine also varied
 arthath ank-63 kaa prakaashan janvari 2005, varsh-1, ank-1 ke rup main hua
 Although the year and issue number were not mentioned in this issue, issue-64 was prominently mentioned as year-1, digit-2 in March 2005
 pradhan sampadak kamala prasad ke atirikt lambe samay tak iske sampadak rahe hai swayan prakaash evam rajendra sharma
 Kamala Prasad ji was associated with life for life Vasudha from the time he was appointed as editor-in-chief
 iskaa sampadakeey karyaalay bhi unka awaas 'em 31, niraala nagar' hi tha
 Due to his death on March 25, 2011, after editing till issue-87, the responsibility of editing from issue-88 was handled by Prakash and Rajendra Sharma himself
 ab iskaa karyaalay 'mayaram surajan smriti bhawan, shastri nagar, pi0 and tii0 chauraahaa, bhopal-3' main aa gaya
 After issue-95, Prakash ji himself withdrew from its editing and issue-96 was published in a different form by editing only Rajendra Sharma
 ank-95 tak 'pragatisheel vasudha' ke mukh prishth par ek tagaline 'pragatisheel lekhak sangh kaa prakaashan' ke rup main jaati rahi
 From issue 96 it changed into 'publication of Madhya Pradesh Progressive Writers Association'
 is ank main ghoshnaa kii gayi ki aagaamee 4 ankon tak hi is rup main iskaa prakaashan hoga
 "in the meantime efforts will be made to set up a new editorial and administrative team for progressive Vasudha, this will be the third instance of 'vasudha' set up by Harishankar Parsai and now Kamala Prasad
" " 'vasudha' has been the leading magazine in the field of extracting rich and quality issues
 haalanki 'pragatisheel vasudha' ke rup main iske saamaanya ankon ko bhi visheshankon kii tarah, balki usase kahin badhkar bhi, mana jaataa rahaa he; phir bhi anekanek visheshankon ke dwaara is patrika ne kirtimanon kaa ek maandand kaayam kar diya he
 Special issue focusing on Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma was published in the form of issue-51 of 'vasudha', which was highly discussed
 isse pehle bhi "patrika ke kai visheshank charchaa main rahe hai
