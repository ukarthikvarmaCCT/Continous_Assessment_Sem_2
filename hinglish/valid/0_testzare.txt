 indonesia main is dharm kaa aupchaarik naam "hindu aagam" he
 Hindu is not only a community but a way of life
 logon kaa maananaa he ki "hinsaayam dooyate yaa sa hindu" arthath jo apane man vachan karm se hinsa se dur rahe vah hindu he
 Vatsyayan has clarified religion by comparing religion and unrighteousness
 vatsyayan maanate hai ki maanav ke liye dharm mansa, vaachaa, karmana hota he
 It is not only related to actions or deeds, but it is also related to thinking and speech
 mahabharat ke vanaparv main kaha he- The Jain scripture, Tattvartha Sutra, describes 10 religions
 yah 10 dharm he: In a schizophrenia mood, man has no knowledge of his personality
 uske jivan main na to ullas kaa prashn rahata he, na vishaad kaa
 Hence this mood can be called second childhood
 is manodasha main aane par rogi main apane aapako sanbhaalane kii koi shakti nahin rahati
 He is not even able to do the daily work of excrement
 bichhaavan par hi vah malmutra kar detaa he
 There is no thought in laughing and crying
 vah kis samay kya kar daalega, iske vishay main koi anumaan nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Talking two or four minutes of reasoning, he can say something that is absolutely unrestrained
 vah hanste hanste apane saamne khadey balak kaa galaa ghot saktaa he
 Schizophrenia patients are superstitious
 They not only see God but also interact with them and sometimes carry out their obedience and perform sacrifices
 bharat main ek schizophreniya ke rogi ne ek raat main lohe kii rod se sadak ke kinare so rahe iktalis logon kii hatya kii or shanti se apane ghar main jaakar baith gaya
 The police arrested
 us samay main us rogi ke chehre par aseem shanti thi
 Because he did all this on the instructions of the Sun God
 surya bhagwaan roj usase baaten kiya karte the
 This patient is in Tihar Jail, Delhi
 spasht taur par sirf ek andeh
 On everyone, on every situation and from every angle
 baaki baaten baad main aati hai
 This can be called psycho-somatic disorder
 yani shaareerik kshati kaa bhugtan maansik avasthaa karti he
 There are two parts of the brain
 daanyaa or baayan
 In both these parts or say that red blood cells are not used to deliver oxygen to the brain
 iske liye alag se oxigen kariers hote hai
 These carriers go to the back of the brain and take oxygen from RBC and then go to different parts of the brain
 vahaan oxigen kii supplai ho jaati he
 Careers are predetermined for every part of the brain
 inamen badlaav nahin hota
 Now they cease to be carriers of oxygen, whether from external injury, from a mental disorder or for hereditary reasons
 ab dimag kaa ek hissaa bina oxigen kii avasthaa main aa jaataa he
 So Neuron from that part starts sending messages of dying
 ise niyar deth experionsej kehete hai
 Many people who watch death very closely start seeing flashes, God and many other things
 daayan mastishk is kalpana ko janm detaa he or baayan bhaag use justiphi karata he
 Now the difference in schizophrenia is that this process goes on for twenty-four hours a day, seven days and years
 aise main rogi andeh karne lagata he
 On every fact that comes up
 isi avasthaa main ishwar use ekmaatr sahaayak ke rup main najar aane lagate hai or vah chhadam vishwaas bana letaa he ki ishwar usase baat kar rahe hai yaa ishwar uske kaantect main he
 These people have pseudo-belief in not only God but many other things which are not usually there
 jaise ek rogi ko lagata tha ki uske saamne rakhe shishe main do dregon hai, ek anya rogi ko dusron dwaara kii ja rahi sajeesh diwaar par chitron ke rup main dikhaai detii he
 Another is unethical blaming others
 is sabakaa asar yah hota he ki rogi ke parivaar ke log hi ek-duusare ko galat samajhane lagate hai or rogi ke rog kii vajah bataane lagate hai
 The result is that the patient falls alone
 vah khud yah dyside nahin kar paata he ki koun uske paksh main he or koun virodh main
 Years ago, due to the lack of clear medical opinion of the disease, the patients were first given medicines to inhibit them, later they were also given the help of electric shock, but these patients get cured unexpectedly and sometimes jumbled up
 ab psico somatic disorder kab hoga or kab nahin koi nahin kah saktaa
 In such a situation, the treatment of the patient comes in the way of his treatment
 yani kabhi purna sanyat hota to bhi purna mainic hona
 In this disease, along with family support, good treatment should also be provided
 jo sabase jaruri ha yah beemaari jitani zyada puraani hogi utani hi khatarnaak hoti chali jaayegi
 That is why it is very important to detect this disease at the right time
 yadi ham iskaa uchit samay par pataa chal jaataa ha to iskaa ilaaj sambhav he
 The illustrations i have seen are as follows: - kya kare yaa kya naa kare:- Drugs that have been low inhibitory and have been found to fill the oxygen carrier shortage have come on the market in the recent past

 1971 ke pehle bangladesh, pakistan kaa ek praant tha jiskaa naam 'purvi pakistan' tha jabaki vartmaan pakistan ko pashchimi pakistan kehete the
 The people of East Pakistan took to the streets in protest against many years of struggle and atrocities of the Pakistan Army and suppression of the Bangladeshi
 1971 main azaadi ke andolan ko kuchalane ke liye pakistani sena ne purvi pakistan ke vidroh par amada logon par jamkar atyaachaar kiye
 Millions of people were killed and countless women were looted

 As a result, there was a direct war between India and Pakistan

 With this, a new country emerged in South Asia
 14 agast 1947 ko dharm par aadhaarit swatantra pakistan desh kaa gathan hua, tatkaaleen pakistan ke do bhaag the purvi evam pashchimi pakistan evam dono hi bhaag me saamaajik, aarthik evam shaikshnik samanthaayen nahi thim| sansadhano ke anusaar purvi pakistan zyada samrudh tha lekin raajnneetik rup se pashchimi pakistan zyada prakhar evam haaavee tha
 Thus the social and economic disparities found in two parts of the same country and the tendency of enlightened people to control the power itself led to nationwide dissatisfaction and finally the formation of Bangladesh in 1971
 pakistan ke gathan ke samay pashchimi kshetra main sindhi, pathan, baloch or mujahiron kii badi sankhya thi, jabaki purv hisse main bengali bolne waalon kaa bahumat tha
 Although there was never a lack of political consciousness in the eastern part, but the eastern part could never get proper representation in the power of the country and always remained politically neglected
 isse purvi pakistan ke logon main jabardast naaraazgi thi
 And to take political advantage of this resentment, Bangladesh leader Sheikh mujib-ur-rehman formed Awami League and demanded more autonomy within Pakistan
 1970 main hue aam chunaav main purvi kshetra main shaikh kii party ne jabardast vijay hasil kii

 lekin unke dwaara dabaav se maamle ko hal karne ke prayaas kiye gayi jisase sthiti puri tarah bighad gai
 On 25 March 1971, there was a massive massacre in this part of Pakistan under the leadership of the army and police
 isse pakistani sena main kaam kar rahe purvi kshetra ke nivaasiyon main jabardast rosh hua or unhone alag mukti vahini bana lee
 The Pakistani military continued to persecute innocent, weaponless people

 Before becoming Bangladesh, the Pakistani military in East Pakistan violated human rights with the help of local leaders and religious extremists
 25 march 1971 ko shuru hue oparation search lite se lekar puure bangladesh kii azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan purvi pakistan main jamkar hinsa hui

 At the behest of the Pakistan Army, the Razakars, Al Shams and Al Badr tortured Bengali-speaking minorities and Bengali-speaking Muslims in erstwhile East Pakistan and fiercely violated human rights
 unke dwaara kiye gayi amanviya atyaachaar ke pramaan aaj tak bangladesh me samuhik kabron ke rup me milte rahe hai | After the massacres in erstwhile East Pakistan in 1971, several mass graves have been built, which have been known till date
 1999 main dhaka main masjid ke paas ek vishaal kabr kaa pataa chalaa

 is telegram ke mutabik bengaaliyon ke khilaaf yuddh kii pehali hi raat ko dhaka uniwarsity main chaatro or aam logon ko saream maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Massacres were carried out in all the areas from where opposition was feared
 Even people were taken out of the houses and fryed with bullets
 1971 main purvi pakistan main lakhon mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar, atyaachaar kiya gaya or hatya kii gayi
 According to an estimate, such excesses were made with about four lakh such women, who committed acts of forced sexual relations with them, women in military cant as sex workers etc
 and acts like gang rape
 563 bengali mahilaon ko kaint ilaake main kar rakhaa tha kaidaladai ke pehle hi din se 563 bengali mahilaon ko dhaka ke dingi military kaint main kaid kar diya gaya tha
 Pakistani army soldiers used to commit excesses with these women

 First of all, Muhammad Tughluq allocated the posts on the basis of merit without any discrimination
 nasl or varg-vibhed ko samaapt karke yogyata ke aadhaar par adhikariyon ko niyukt karne kii niti apanaayi
 In fact, it was the misfortune of that ruler that his plans were not executed successfully
 jiske kaaran yah itihaaskaaron kii aalochana kaa paatr bana
 While sitting on the throne of Muhammad Tughlaq, the Delhi Sultanate was divided into a total of 23 provinces, the main ones of which were Delhi, Devgiri, Lahore, Multan, Sarmuti, Gujarat, Awadh, Kannauj, Lakhnauti, Bihar, Malwa, Jajnagar, Dvarasamudra etc
 kashmir evam baluchistan bhi dilli sultanate main shaamil the
 The extent of the Delhi Sultanate was extended during this reign
 parantu isaki krur niti ke kaaran rajya main vidroh armbh ho gaya
 As a result, a new independent state was established in the south and these regions were separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal bhi swatantra ho gaya
 After the ascension, Muhammad Tughlaq tried to make some new plans and implement them
 jaise - Through his first plan, Muhammad Tughlaq increased the tax in the fertile region of Doab, but in the same year there was a severe famine in Doab, which affected the yield
 tululaq ke adhikariyon dwaara jabaran kar vasuulne se us kshetra main vidroh ho gaya, jisase tululaq kii yah yojana asafal rahi
 Muhammad Tughlaq established a new department called 'diwan-e-amir Kohi' for the development of agriculture
 sarkari karmchaariyon ke bhrashtachar, kisaanon kii udaseenta, bhoomi kaa acha na hona ityadi kaarnon se krishi unnati sambandhi apni yojana ko teen varsh pashchaat samaapt kar diya
 Muhammad bin Tughlaq provided loans to farmers at very low interest
 tululaq ne apni duusari yojana ke antargat rajdhani ko dilli se devgiri sthaanantarit kiya
 Devagiri was also called "kuvvatul Islam"
 sultan qutubuddin mubarak kilji ne devgiri kaa naam 'qutubabad' rakhaa tha or mohammad bin tululaq ne iskaa naam badalakar daulatabad kar diya
 The Sultan was most criticized for this plan
 mohammad tululaq dwaara rajdhani parivartan ke kaarnon par itihaaskaaron main bada vivaad he, phir bhi nishkarshtah kaha ja saktaa he ki, devgiri kaa dilli sultanate ke madhya sthit hona, mongol akramanakariyon ke bhay se surakshit rahanaa, dakshin-bharat kii sampannataa kii ore khinchaav aadi aise kaaran the, jinke kaaran sultan ne rajdhani parivartit karne kii baat sochi
 This plan of Muhammad Tughlaq also failed completely and he allowed people from Daulatabad to return to Delhi in 1335 AD

 According to Barani, probably due to the vacancy of the treasury and the success of the policy of expansion of his empire, the sultan got the sign currency introduced
 sankethik mudra ke antargat sultan ne sambhawatah pital or tamba dhaatuon ke sikke chalaaye, jiskaa mulya chaandi ke rupee taka ke baraabar hota tha
 Due to lack of state control over coinage, many fake mints were made
 lagaan jaali sikke se diya jane laga, jisase arthvyavastha thapp ho gai
 Inspiration for running sign currency came from China and Iran
 vahaan ke shaskaon ne in yojanaon ko safaltaapurvak chalaaya, jabaki mohammad tululaq kaa prayog vifal rahaa
 The Sultan suffered terrible financial losses on the failure of his plan
 chauthi yojana ke antargat mohammad tululaq ke khurasaan evam karachil vijay abhiyaan kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 In order to conquer Khorasan, Muhammad Tughlaq gave a salary of one year in advance to a large army of 3,70,000 soldiers, but due to political change the two countries reached a compromise, which failed the Sultan's plan and financially hurt him
 Had to lift
 karachil abhiyaan ke antargat sultan ne khusro malik ke netritv main ek vishaal sena ko pahari rajyon ko jeetne ke liye bheja
 His entire army wandered in the wild paths, according to Ibn Battuta, ultimately only ten officers could survive and return
 is prakaar mohammad tululaq kii yah yojana bhi asafal rahi
 Probably between 1328-29 AD, the Mongol invader Tarmasharin Chagtai invaded India with a huge army and trampled the territories from Multan, Lahore to Delhi
 aisa mana jaataa he ki, sultan mohammad tululaq ne mongol netaa ko ghoose dekar waapas kar diya tha ye bhi smbhv he ki mongol netaa ne sultan ko dilli sltant ko khud hi ythasthiti kamazor karne va isi tarah mongol shasn ke liye zmin tyaar karne ke liye ghoose di
 Whatever happened between them, the Sultan was subjected to criticism due to this compromise policy towards the Mongol leader
 ye sahi he ki iske baad phir kabhi mohammad tululaq ke samay main bharat par mongol akraman nahin hua or ye bhi ki apni mahattvakankshi asafal yojanaon ke kaaran mohammad tululaq ko ‘asafalataaon kaa badshaah’ kaha jaataa he
 Most revolts took place during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, of which 27 revolts took place in South India alone

 While excavating the Mayan cemetery in Honduras in 1931, archaeologists found a piece of jaw of Maya origin dating to around 600 AD
 This jaw, which probably belonged to a twenty-year-old woman, contained three pieces of tooth-shaped shell that had been installed in a cotter of three missing lower rodent teeth
 chalis saal tak puratathvik jagat ke log yahi maanate rahe ki in kholon ko lagbhag usee tareeke se us mahila kii maut ke baad sthapit kiya gaya tha jis tareeke kaa istemaal pracheen misravasiyon main bhi dekha gaya tha
 However, in 1970, Professor Amadio Bobio, a Brazilian dental teacher, studied the specimen of that jaw and took several radiographs of it
 His attention was drawn to the dense bone structure surrounding the two implants, leading him to conclude that these implants were installed during the woman's life

 These employees planned a method of building a chamber of titanium and then embedded it in the soft tissue of the rabbit ears
 Swedish disabled surgeon Pii Brenmark, interested in healing and regenerating bones, adopted a "rabbit ear chamber" designed in Cambridge in 1952 for use in the rabbit's thigh bone
 After several months of study, he tried to retrieve these expensive chambers from the rabbits and saw that he was unable to remove them
 brinmark ke paryvekshan ke anusaar titanium ke saath haddi kaa vikaas itnaa kareeb se ho gaya tha ki yah prabhavi rup se dhaatu se jud gaya tha
 Brenmark conducted this phenomenon and numerous studies on both animals and humans, all of which confirmed this unique property of titanium

 Although Brenmark actually believed that it should first be used for knee and hip surgery, he eventually decided that the mouth was more accessible for continued clinical supervision and due to the higher rate of adentulism in the general public
 a large number of patients were available for a fairly detailed study

 The implant screw can be self-tapping and clamped to a small torque so that it does not overload the surrounding bone
 Typically in most implant systems the depth of the osteotomy or drilled hole is approximately 1 mm greater than the depth required to position the implant because of the shape of the top end of the drill
 mahatvapurn dhaanchon ke aasapaas ke kshetra main drill karte samay sarjan ko atirikt lambaai ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 Traditionally, an incision is made at the crest of the place where the implant is to be placed

 If the implant is loaded too soon then the implant may be shaken and fail
 It may take eighteen months for a new implant to heal, possibly join, and eventually establish
 isliye kai thik hone ke samay ko kam karne ke prati anicchhuk hai
 An implant is set up either as a 'healing abutment' that comes through the mucosa or as a 'cover screw' that is swept along the surface of the dental implant
 jab ek cover scru ko sthapit kiya jaataa he to mucosa implant ko ekikrut karte samay ise dhank letaa he uske baad healing abutment lagane ke liye duusari surgery ko puraa kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes two-stage surgery is chosen when a concurrent bone graft is placed or when there is a possibility of surgery on the mucosa for esthetic reasons
 Some implants are in one piece together so that no healing abstraction is required
 saavdhaneepurvak chaynit maamalon main rogiyon ko ek hi surgery main implant sthapit kiya ja saktaa he or is prakriya ko "twarit loding" kaa naam diya gaya he
 In such cases a temporary prosthesis or crown shape is fixed to avoid the bite force by moving the implant while integrating with the bone

 When preoperatively computerized tomography, also known as cone beam computed tomography or CBCT, is used to accurately locate vital structures including the inferior alveolar canal, the mantle foramen, and the maxillary sinus, the number of visits and waiting times Like the time it takes, the chances of complications can also be cut
 paaramparik medical siti scanning kii tulana main 2% kam vikiran ke istemaal vaale cone beam siti scanning se ruchi vaale kshetra main adhik sateekta praapt hoti he or yah rogi ke liye zyada surakshit he
 The CBCT enables the surgeon to construct a surgical guide, with the help of which the surgeon is able to position the implant in the right angle in the ideal location

 Implantologists typically try to position the implant in the bone at least as deep as the crown or tooth above the bone
 This is called the 1: 1 crown to root ratio
 yah anupaat zyaadaatar maamalon main bone graphting ke liye lakshya nirdhaarit karata he

 May be required
 computer dizin placement gidon kii taiyaari ke liye usee radiographic data kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 When done correctly, bone grafts produce living vascular bone that looks largely like natural jaw bone and is therefore suitable as a foundation for implants

 In all cases it is necessary to pay attention to the final functional aspects of the restoration, such as the force exerted on the implant
 Chewing and dilution may increase the implant loading at the implant bone interface and / or the biometric tolerance of the titanium material itself, leading to failure
 yah swayan implant kii vifaltaa yaa haddi kii haani ho sakati he jo aasapaas kii haddi kaa "pighalanaa" yaa avasorana he

 This novel has been considered as one of the best novels in Hindi literature
 yah upanyaas do bhaagon main vibhajit he
 Its first part 'watan aur Desh' was published in 1958 AD from Viplav Office, Lucknow and the second part 'desh ka Bhavishya' was published in 1960 AD
 iske pehle bhaag main lahore ke bholaa paandhe kii gali ke pariwaron ke bahaane jan saamaanya ke jivan kaa chithran karte hue desh ke vibhaajan evam usase utpann bheeshan sampradayik dange aadi kaa chithran karte hue sharnaarthiyon ke ek desh chhodkar duusare main palaayan kii vivashtaa tak kaa chithran kiya gaya he
 In the second part, the indicative depiction of the deficiencies in the creation of the country, the corruption of leaders, the deviation of revolutionary consciousness, the middle class trapped in the tragedy of selfishness Lipsa and the decisive power of the people in spite of all this has been done on a wide pane
 jhootha sach ke pramukh paatr hai jayadev puri, uski bahan tara or jayadev puri kii patni kanak
 Tara and Jaidev are a family of Puri, Kanaka's second family
 in donon parivaar kii kahaniyon ke madhyam se upanyaas kii kahani aage badhati he or atyadhik vistaar main jaakar bahuaiami ho jaati he
 The story of the false truth has been woven as the backdrop of the horrific riots that took place during the independence of India in 1947
 british aupniveshikta, uski 'foot daalo or raaj karo' kii niti tathaa muslim lig ke 'do raashtra kaa siddhant' se milakar brihattar bhartiya samaaj main swatah maujuud chuaachhut kii nimna bhaavana evam sampradayikta kii dabi chetana aisi ubhari ki puraa bharat varsh aisi jwaala se dadhak uthaa jiskaa koi doosraa udhaaharan nahin mil paata he
 It will be considered one of the world's most brutal incidents in the history of human torture
 lagbhag ek dashak is updrav kaa prabhaav bana rahaa
 Immediately, thousands of thousands of people were killed in communal riots by violent animals, who were caught by the gnawing emotions, millions were displaced, women and children were tortured with inhumanity and a huge population of the entire country

 At the end of this part, the driver of a bus carrying refugees says "rabb whom he had made one, Rabb's captors made them two with their splendor and oppression
 " The second section of 'false Truth', in the 'future of the Country', marks the progressive and regressive role of intellectuals and leaders in the development and future construction of the country in the decade after independence
 jayadev puri or sood pratigaami shaktiyon ke pratinidhi rup main bhrasht raajnneeti kaa udhaaharan prastut karata he or tara jaisi krantikari chetana se yukt vikaas kii raah par chalane vaali stri bhi sukh-samruddhi evam prabhaav kii lipsaa main padakar vidambnaa kaa dukhad udhaaharan prastut karti he
 The prime minister, who is busy riddling with action, seems to take recourse only to speech and presents a horrific example of extravagance
 kul milakar vistrut chitra-falak par yashpal dikhalaate hai ki desh kaa bhavishya antat desh kii saamaanya janata ke hi haath main he jo samgr sthitiyon kaa avlokan kar sahi vastusthiti ko pahchaan sake
 That is why Yashpal draws various situations, does not make a linear or idealistic depiction of a character, because it is possible to do this in practical life, but it is often not possible
 is upanyaas main desh kii duravastha ke liye janata kii andruni kamajoriyon evam nirjeevta ko bhi kaaphi uttaradaayi dikhalaayaa gaya he
 However, by the end of the novel, it is proved that this depiction has actually been done with the objective of correctly identifying the situation
 upanyaas ke ant main congress ke bhrashtachari parantu prabalata praapt netaa sood chunaav haar jaataa he or is parinaam par doctor nath gambhir hokar tippanee karata he -- "gil, ab to vishwaas karoge, janata nirjeev nahin he

 " jhootha sach bharat vibhaajan kii prishthbhumi par kendrit vrihattar evam bahuaiami falak vaala upanyaas he
 In this, the time from pre-partition to post-partition is delineated

 This novel is in fact a well-written saga of the rise and fall of a larger mass-society divided in different religions and classes, depicted with the center of division
 vibhaajan se pehle logon ke man main utpann hone vaale vighatanvaadee bhav tathaa vibhaajan ke baad desh athwa shashan ke sanghatan ke liye aavashyak samarpan evam sooyeeboojh main hone vaali kami -- donon par sookshm drushti rakhte hue yashpal ne is upanyaas kaa taana bana buna he
 In this novel, Yashpal has depicted how communal consciousness affects human destiny far and how the distressing of circumstances can turn the revolutionary consciousness inherent in the masses towards selfishness Lipsa
 bharat kaa madhya varg krantikari chetana se yukt hokar puunjipati varg ke paakhand kii aalochana karte hue bhi kis prakaar swayan vaisaa hi jivan jeene kii tragedy kii ore badhate jaataa he, iskaa aupnyasik rachaav dekhne yogya he
 The creative formation of the novel is so efficient that the epistemology of this epic novel is considered to be inherent in the mystery that in its narrative structure it becomes difficult to decide that 'false truth' is the account of the partition of the country under the pretext of Tara's destiny story
 Or that Tara's destiny is as a result of the partition of the country
 upanyaas main tara swayan karti he- "mere bhagya ke kaaran desh kaa bantwaaraa hua yaa desh ke bhagya ke kaaran meri durgati hui
 " dow0 ramvilas sharma yashpal ke ghor virdohi ke rup main maane jate hai, parantu unhone sambhawatah sabase pehle yah ghoshit kar diya tha ki 'jhootha sach' yashpal ji ke upanyaason main sarvshereshth he
 It will be counted among the best new and old novels of Hindi - it is also certain

 Poet Kunwar Narayan wrote a review of this novel under the title 'lack of Poetry'
 iske bainks anand prakaash kaa spasht mat he ki is upanyaas kaa ek bahut bada gun he isaki rochakata or atyadhik saahitiyikta
 


 Yes, Yashpal has been successful enough to relate the unmistakable portrayal of 'social environment' and 'historical reality' to mostly correct literary understanding and expression
 sivakumar mishra ke anusaar 'jhootha sach' ko pathakon kii vyapak saraahna mili
 Allegations of 'news cuttings' came from here and there, but Ramesh Kuntal Megh correctly identified his creative nature by calling him 'history written as art'
 itane vishad pat par, aadhunik itihaas kii ek rachanaatmak ghatana itihaas se vilag kaise rah sakegi? yashpal kii khubi he ki unhone us itihaas ko kala ke apane saushthav se jodakar prastut kiya
 In the context of the various allegations made on this novel, Ramdarash Mishra ji believes that there are many things but i think that the author has made a very beautiful harmony of the depth, modern destiny and value of the then events and circumstances and the depth of human inner truths
 is
 yah shikaayat kii gayi he ki is upanyaas main lekhak kii apni drushti aar-paar vyapat nahin he kintu mujhe lagata he ki yah lekhak kii sarjanaatmak drushti ke liye shubh lakshan he ki vah yatharth ke lok kii mukt yatra karti he, isi purvagrah se aakraant nahin he
 This creative vision on the one hand inspires the writer to see the true form of reality, on the other hand, since it is the surgeon's vision, seeing events and facts as they are, they see them in the context of human truths and from within Manufactures something
 prastut mahakavyatmak upanyaas main yashpal kii drushti ne kahin saath nahin choda he, vah aarpaardarshee he or use is baat kii pahchaan he ki kya hokar bhi jhooth he or kya naa hokar bhi sahi he
 The author is a Marxist, but in this novel, his Marxist ideology is not dominant in itself and is supportive of his artistic vision
 is vishalkay upanyaas ko puri tarah padhe bina kuch suni-sunai yaa likhi-padhi tippaniyon ke anusaar moolyankit karne ko bilkul aparyaapt evam anuchit maanate hue upanyaason ke naveen antardarshi sameekshak virendra yadav kaa kahana he ki sach to yah he ki jhootha sach ek aupnyasik kriti maatr na hokar vibhaajan ke daur or uske baad ke bhartiya samaaj va raajnneeti kaa kaaljayi dastavej he
 In many ways, it is also the antithesis of the well-known discussions and dominance of partition of India
 is upanyaas kii sabase badi khubi yah he ki na to yah sarhad ke is paar ke lekhak kii rachana lagati he or na hi kisi purush lekhak kii
 


 there is no doubt that 'false truth' has the status of 'classic' in Hindi novels, but it is necessary to know the reasons for which it is in the category of 'classic'
 isliye aavashyak he iskaa padhaa janaa
 In response to the allegations leveled by Kunwar Narayan ji, Madhuresh, considered Yashpal's authentic commentator, wrote a detailed review article titled "false Truth": Epic in the novel and declared that giving an analytical answer to the allegations of Kunwar Narayan Ji 'false truth' is accepted as one of the best works of Yashpal, he is also one of the ten best and notable novels in Hindi

 iske parinamswaroop rus se zaar ke swechhachari shashan kaa ant hua tathaa roosi soviet sanghatmak samaajawaadee ganraajya kii sthapana hui
 This revolution took place in two parts - in March 1917, and in October 1917
 pehali kranti ke falswaroop samraat ko pad-tyaag ke liye vivash hona padaa tathaa ek asthaayee sarkaar bani
 As a result of the October Revolution, the Provisional Government was replaced by a temporary government
 1917 kii roosi kranti beesvin sadi ke vishwa itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana rahi
 France's state revolution in 1789 AD affected Europe's life on a deeper level by propagating the spirit of freedom, equality and brotherhood
 roosi kranti kii vyapaktaa ab tak kii sabhi raajnneetik ghatnaon kii tulana main bahut vistrut thi
 It not only brought an end to autocratic, monarchical, autocratic, czarist rule but ended the economic and social power of the elite landlords, feudalists, capitalists etc
 and established the first power of workers and peasants in the world
 marks dwaara pratipaadit vaigyanik samaajwaad kii vichaardhaara ko moort rup pehali baar roosi kranti ne pradaan kiya
 This revolution established the socialist system and established itself as the father of this system
 yah vichaardhaara 1917 ke pashchaat itani shaktishaalee ho gai ki 1950 tak lagbhag aadha vishwa iske antargat aa chukaa tha
 The world history after the revolution was dynamic in some way that it was either in favor of its spread or against its spread
 rus kii kranti kaa mahatv na keval europe ke itihaas main varan vishwa ke itihaas main he
 Just as the most important event in the history of the 18th century is the State Revolution of France, similarly the most important event of the twentieth century was the Bolshevik Revolution of Russia in 1917 AD
 rus main saamaajik samanta kaa nitant abhaav tha
 At this time, the entire society of Russia was divided into three different categories, in which there was no goodwill among themselves
 ve ek duusare ko apane se purnataya bhinn or pruthak samajhati thim
 Czar Nicholas was an absolute autocratic and autocratic ruler
 yah janata ko kisi prakaar kaa adhikaar pradaan karne ke paksh main nahin tha
 The following reasons of the Russian Revolution of 1917 were- anya deshon ke samaan rus main bhi audyogic kranti hui, yadhyapi yahaan par kranti anya deshon kii apeksha kaaphi samay ke uparaant hui kintu iske hone par rus main bahut se kaarkaanon kii sthapana ho gai thi
 Thus began the industrialization of Russia
 isamen kaam karne ke kaaran lakhon kii sankhya main majdoor dehaton or gaanvon kaa parityag kar un nagaron tathaa shaharon main nivas karne lage, jinamein kal kaarkaanon kii sthapana hui thi
 Due to residing in cities and cities, they were no longer as simple as before
 nagaron main rahane se unamem na keval chalata-poorjaapan hi aa gaya tha, apitu ye raajnneetik maamalon main bhi ruchi lene lage the
 He also took note of his political and social rights
 inhone apane klbon kaa nirmaan kiya, jahaan ye sab prakaar ke maamalon par vichaar karte the or aapas main vaad-vivaad karte the
 He also got knowledge of new ideologies and trends by staying here
 inhone shramik sanghathanon kii sthapana bhi kerani aarambhn There was a revolution in Russia in 1905, by which an attempt was made to establish a legal monarchy in Russia, but due to mutual quarrels, this revolution could not succeed and the rule was re-established
 is kranti kaa spasht parinaam yah hua ki usne rus kii saadhaaran janata ko raajnneetik adhikaron kaa parichay kara diya tha
 He came to know what the meaning of the vote is? How should members of Parliament be elected in Duma or in other words? The government should decide its policy according to the public opinion and move forward to do the works of public interest
 apane raajnneetik adhikaron se parichit ho jane ke kaaran rus kii janata samaj gai ki rus main bhi purnataya loktantr shashan kii sthapana honi chaiye jahaan saadhaaran janata ke haath main shashan satta ho
 The democracy states of Western Europe also had an impact on Russia, although the emperors of Russia made special efforts to stop the propagation of Western progressive ideas in Russia, but it is very difficult to stop the ideas, because ideas are like air
 
 pratham vishwayuddh ke samay germany or uske saathiyon ke viruddh jo prachaar-kaary mitra rashtron kii ore se kiya ja rahaa tha, usamen mukhyatah yahi kaha jaataa tha ki ve loktantr shashan, janata kii swatantraaa or rashtriyata ke aadhaar par naveen rashtron kaa nirmaan karne ke abhipraay se yuddh kar rahe hai
 Russia was under the Allies
 atah vahaan kii janata par bhi is prachaar kaa bahut asar padaa
 Education was promoted in Russian to middle-class individuals

 They used to study new books

 Many Asian writers also presented new and progressive ideas through their texts
 shikshit varg par un naye vichaaron kaa bahut adhik prabhaav padaa, visheshtah navayuvak vidhyaarthee naye vichaaron kaa adhyayan kar yah bhalee-bhaanti samajhane lage the ki unka desh unnati kii daud main bahut pichhadaa hua he, jiskaa pramukh kaaran jaar kii nirankushta he
 a feeling was awakened in his heart that it is his duty to make great efforts to upgrade his country
 mahayuddh main rus mitra rashtron kii ore se sammilit hua
 His large army demonstrated great ability and competence at the start of the war, but after two years of continuous fighting, the signs of laxity were clearly visible in it
 rus kii sena bahadur avashya thi, kintu usamen desh-bhakthi or rashtriyata kii ve bhaavnaayen vidyaman nahin thi, jo apurv tyaag or mar mitane ke liye prerana pradaan karti hai
 Russian armies were recruited to meet the numbers
 unamem vir sainikon kii parampara avashya thi, par unke sammukh koi adarsh vishesh nahin tha
 This was the condition of Russia's bureaucracy
 rus ke karmchaaree yah nahin samajhate the ki ve desh kii unnati or raashtra seva ke liye niyukt kiye gayi hai
 His ideal was to please the emperor and occupy high positions
 jab vishwayuddh lambaa hota gaya or do varsh kii ladaai ke uparaant bhi vijay ke koi chinh prakat nahin hue to rus kii sena or naukarshahi ghabara uthi
 Bribery, corruption etc
 had already attained their climax in Russia
 garib logon ke liye guzar kar sakna asambhav ho gaya tha
 Finally, on 7 March 1917, the public's condition became very miserable
 uske paas na pahanane ko kapadaa tha or na khaane ko anaaj tha
 She was distraught with hunger and clothes
 pareshaan hokar bhukhe or thand se thithurate hue garib or majaburon ne 7 march din petrogred kii sadakon par ghoomana aarambh kiya
 Bread shops were piled with fresh and hot rotis
 bhukhi janata kaa man taaji or garam chaay va rotiyon ko dekhakar lalachaa gaya or vah apane aapako niyantran main nahin rakh saki
 They started looting in the market
 sarkaar ne sena ko un par goli chalaane kaa aadesh diya ki vah goli chalaakar luutmaar karne waalon ko teetar-bitar kar de, kintu sainikon ne goli chalaane se saaf manaa kar diya kyonki unako janata se sahanubhuti thi
 The spirit of revolution had entered them
 jab mazdooron ne yah dekha ki sainik un par goli chalaane ko taiyaar nahin hai, to unka saahas bahut bad gaya
 Hence, the revolution had become inevitable now
 duusari ore duma ne visarjeet hone se manaa kar diya
 It was compromised by the Petrograd Soviet, on the basis of which a social government was established on 14 March 1917 AD under the chairmanship of the liberal leader George Slavin
 usne 14 march ko jaar se shashan kaa parityag karne kii maang kii
 Bounded by the situation, he accepted his demand and resigned from the government

 The path of Guru Basavanna is later given birth to a new religion called Lingavanta Dharma or Lingayata
 Lingayata ke liye anya samanarthak shabd hai: basav dharm, Sharana dharm, Vachana dharm
 Guru Basavanna was born in 1134 in a Shaivite Kamme Brahmin family living in the small town of Ingaleshwar, Bagewadi grew up in northern Karnataka, Guru Basavanabijapur district to wear Janivara as a strict, religious house where he is known as a sacred thread Was made unhone Janivara ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 He rejected agamas on the basis of religion, scriptures and rules which were written in Sanskrit and were out of reach for the common people
 vah sanskaar ke anushthan ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Srinivasa Murthy, in his book 'vachana Dharma Sara' writes: Vachana Sahitya is not borrowed from other languages, they are the Original and Unique to Kannada language
 What ever is there in Vedas and Upanishads is available in Vachanas, but what ever is there in Vachanas is not there in Vedas and Upanishads
 Guru Basavanna with his original and creative thinking added much value to Kannada language through Vachana Sahitya
 He left Bagewadi and spent the next 12 years studying Sangameshwara, Kudala Sangama in the then-shaivite stronghold
