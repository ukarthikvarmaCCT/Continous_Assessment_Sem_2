 is dauraan in nadiyon par bharat dwaara pariyojnaon ke nirmaan ke liye sateek niyam nishchit kiye gaye
 This treaty was a result of Pakistan's fear that due to the river base in India, it should not face drought and famine etc

 The partition of British India created a conflict over the Indus Basin of plentiful water
 The newly formed states were at odds over how to share and manage what was essentially a cohesive and unitary network of irrigation
 Furthermore, the geography of the division was such that the sources were the Indus Basin of the rivers

 Eugene R
 Black, then president of the World Bank, told Lilienthal that his proposal "makes good sense all round"
 Kale wrote that there was interest in the bank, economic progress was made in two countries and worried that the Indus dispute might be only a serious obstacle to this development

 Black proposed a working party, Indian, Pakistani and World Bank engineers
 The World Bank delegation will act as an advisory group, offering charged suggestions and speedy dialogue with it

 Lilienthal's proposal before me
 i mean, his insistence that the Indus problem is an engineering problem and should be dealt with by engineers
 One of the strengths of the engineering profession is that, engineers all over the world speak the same language and the problem with the approach is decided by common standards
 :110 The Blacks were hoping for a quick resolution to the Indus dispute, ahead of time
 While the bank hoped that both parties would come to an agreement on the allocation of water, neither India nor Pakistan seemed ready to compromise their positions
 While Pakistan has emphasized its historic right to water all the tributaries of the Indus and that half of West Punjab had gone under the threat of desertification, the Indian side argued that the previous distribution of water should not be the future of the set
 Allocation of
 Instead, with the distribution of a new base for the establishment of the Indian side, the waters going along the western tributaries to Pakistan and India to the eastern tributaries
 The original technical discussion that was hoped for, was stymied by political reasons to avoid it was expected

 They threatened to withdraw from the working party, and negotiations verged on collapse

 However, looking at the total numbers, the demand for water in the country seems to be less than the supply

 chunki bharat main varsha saal ke barhon maheene nahin hoti balki ek spasht varsha ritu main hoti he, alag-alag rituon main jal kii uplabdhta alag lag hoti he
 This is the reason that short-term water crisis is also seen in rain-fed areas on the basis of annual rainfall

 'manovidalata' or 'schizophrenia' donon kaa shabdic arth he - 'man kaa tootna'
 There are some major symptoms of schizophrenia, such as: yah aavashyak nahin kii har rogi main yah sabhi lakshan dikhaai paden, isliye yadi kisi bhi vyakti main iname se koi bhi lakshan nazar aae to use turant manochikitsakeey salaah leni chahie

 Extreme stress, social pressures and troubles can also cause illness to be maintained or not cured
 mastishk main rasinic badlaav yaa kabhi-kabhi mastishk kii koi chot bhi is beemaari kii vajah ban sakati he
 The following behavioral changes can be a sign of a worsening state to the patient: - yadi aapako lage kii kisi vyakti main yah lakshan hai to :- Due to these unnecessary effects, the use of the medicine should not be stopped, as these effects automatically decrease with time and general precautions can be taken to prevent them, such as: - schizophrenia kaa rogi mukhya lakshanon ke dur hone ke baad dawa lete hue bilkul saamaanya jivan ji saktaa he
 He can do the job according to his ability, study, make friends and fulfill all his dreams
 sizophrenia kaa rogi lakshan mukt hone ke baad shaadi kar saktaa he, parantu use dhyaan rakhana hoga kii uske jivan main aae nae parivartanon kaa asar uski neend tathaa dawa par na pade
 If the patient is a woman, she should not conceive without medical advice
 sizophrenia ke rogi ke bacchon main yah rog anuvaanshik rup se ja saktaa he, parantu aisa hameshaa ho yah zaruri nahin he
 a person with schizophrenia may exhibit auditory hallucinations, misinformation and disorganized and unnatural thinking and language; It can range from a series of thought and a loss in subject flow, in which sentences are only vaguely related to meaning, to disambiguation in severe cases, called salads
 saamaajik algaav aam taur par vibhinn kaarnon se utpann hote hai
 Impairment in social perception is related to schizophrenia in much the same way as paranoia and paranoid symptoms are associated with paranoia and negative symptoms of avulsion
 ek asaamaanya uparup main, vicitra mudra main sthir rah saktaa he, yaa uddeshyheen uttejnaa pradarshit kar saktaa he; ye sab catatonia ke lakshan hai
 No one symptom is related to the diagnosis of schizophrenia and all other medical and mental conditions can occur
 manovikrutiyon kaa maujuuda vargeekaran yah maanata he ki ashaant gatividhi ke kam se kam chah maheenon kii avadhi main rog lakshan kam se kam ek maheene tak upasthit rahani chahie
 Short-term schizophrenia-like psychosis is known as schizophrenia

 In 40% of men and 23% of women treated with schizophrenia, the condition occurred before the age of 19
 ek yuva vayask ke saamaajik or vyavsaayik vikaas main ye bahut mahatvapurn kaal hai or unhen gambhir rup se baadhit kiya ja saktaa he
 To minimize the effects of schizophrenia, substantial work has been done recently to identify and treat the early stage of the disease, which has been detected for the first 30 months after the onset of disease symptoms, but They may be present for longer
 jin logon main sizophrenia viksit hone lagata he unhen praarambhik avadhi main saamaajik sambandh-viched, chidchidapan or bechaini ke gaiyr-vishesh lakshanon, or manovikruti spasht dikhaai dene ke pehle praarambhik charan main kshanik yaa swat:-simit karne vaale manovikruti sambandhit lakshanon kaa anubhav ho saktaa he
 Psychiatrist Kurt Schneider listed the forms of psychiatric symptoms that he believed to distinguish schizophrenia from other psychiatric disorders
 ye pratham-shrenee ke lakshan yaa shenidar ke pratham-shrenee ke lakshan kahe jate hai or ve mithyaa bhram ko ek bahari shakti ke dwaara niyantrit kiye jane kii shrenee main shaamil karte hai; yah vishwaas ki vichaaron ko kisi ke chetan man main daalaa ja rahaa he yaa usase waapas liya ja rahaa he; yah vishwaas ki kisi ek vyakti ke vichaar anya logon tak prasaarit kiye ja rahe hai; or vibhram vaale awaajon ko sunanaa jo kisi vyakti ke vichaaron yaa gatividhiyon par tippanee karte hai yaa jinka anya vibhram vaali awaajon ke saath ek vaartalap hota he
 Although they have contributed significantly to the current diagnostic criteria, questions have been raised on the specificity of first-line symptoms
 1970 or 2005 ke bich kiye gaye naidanik adhyayanon kii samiksha main yah paaya gaya ki ye adhyayan na to shenidar ke daavon kii ek pun:pushti na hi uski asweekruti kii anumati pradaan karte hai or usne suzav diya ki bhavishya main naidanik pranaaliyon ke punarikshanon main pratham shrenee ke lakshanon par jor dena khatm kiya jaae
 Schizophrenia is often described as a positive and negative symptom
 sakaaratmak lakshan shabd un lakshanon ko suchit karata hai jiskaa anubhav aam taur par adhikansh vyakti nahin karte hai lekin ve schizophrenia main upasthit rahete hai
 They include false delusions, auditory hallucinations and thinking disorders, and they are specifically considered to be manifestations of psychosis
 nakaaratmak lakshan ve baaten hai jo schizophrenia se prabhavit vyaktiyon main upasthit nahin rahete hai lekin ve aam taur par swasth logon main paae jate hai, arthath, lakshan jo saamaanya visheshtaon yaa kshamtaaon main kami yaa nuksaan ko darshaate hai
 Common negative symptoms include monotonous or dulling effects and mood, language kindness, inability to feel pleasure, lack of desire to establish a relationship, and lack of motivation

 Studies by neurological psychological tests and brain modeling techniques such as fmri and PET to test for functional differences in brain function have shown that differences are mostly found in the frontal / anterior part of the brain, hippocampus, and temporal parts

 This concept also confirms the fact that amphetamines, which increase the secretion of dopamine, can worsen psychiatric symptoms in the event of schizophrenia
 ek prabhavali avadharana, jise sizophrenia kaa dopamine sidghant bhi kehete hai, ke anusaar D2 abhigrahakon kaa atyadhik sakriy hona sizophrenia kaa kaaran hota he

 However, according to these studies, the average change in volume is close to the measurement range set by MRI methods, so it is naïve to determine that schizophrenia is a neurological process that is weighty when symptoms appear
 Or that it is better to consider it a process of neurological development in which an abnormal amount of brain is produced at an early age

 kuch aise siddhant hai jo tark dete hai ki, sangyanatmak kriya - ek nirnay, moolyankan yaa vichaar - kisi bhaavana ko utpann karne ke liye aavashyak he

 is prakaar kii sangyanatmak kriya chetan yaa avchetan ho sakati hai tathaa vaicharik prakriya kaa rup le sakati he yaa nahin le sakati he

 That is why there has been a feeling of negativity and resentment among the youth of Assam
 pachaas dashak se hi gaiyr-kanoonee rup se bahari logon kaa assam main aana ek raajnneetik mudda banane laga tha, lekin 1979 main yah ek pramukh mudde ke rup main saamne aayaa, jab badi sankhya main bangladesh se aane vaale logon ko rajya kii matadaata suchi main shaamil kar liya gaya
 The by-election was announced after the death of Manglodi Lok Sabha constituency MP in 1978
 chunaav adhikari ne paaya ki matadaataaon kii sankhya main achaanak jabardast izaafaa ho gaya he
 This created resentment at the local level
 yah mana gaya ki bahari logon, vishesh rup se bangladeshiyon ke aane ke kaaran hi is kshetra main matadaataaon kii sankhya main jabardast badhotaree hui he
 The Assam Gana Sangram Parishad, consisting of the All Assam Student Union and regional political, literary and cultural organizations, launched a movement against the multiracial
 gauratlab he ki ek chaatr sanghathan ke rup main aasu angrezon ke jamaane se hi astitv main tha
 His name at that time was Ahom Student Involvement
 lekin 1940 main yah sanghathan vibhajit hua or 1967 main in donon dhadon kaa phir se vilay ho gaya or sanghathan kaa naam ol assam students association rakhaa gaya
 But then its name was changed to All Assam Student Union or Aasu
 aasu dwaara chalaaye gayi andolan ko asamiya bhashaa bolne vaale hinduon, muslimon or bahut se bengaaliyon ne bhi khul kar samarthan diya
 The leaders of the movement claimed that 31 to 34 percent of the state's population belongs to illegal people from outside
 unhone centre sarkaar se maang kii ki vah bahari logon ko assam aane se rokane ke liye yahan kii simaaon ko sil kar de, gair-kanoonee bahari logon kii pahchaan kare or unke naam ko matadaata suchi se hathaaye or jab tak aisa na ho assam main koi chunaav na karaaye
 The movement also demanded that people coming to the state after 1961 be sent back to their original state or resettled elsewhere
 is andolan ko itnaa zordaar samarthan mila ki 1984 main yahan ke solah sansadeey kshetron se 14 sansadeey kshetron main chunaav nahin ho paaya
 There was political instability in the state between 1979 and 1985
 raashtrapati shashan bhi lagu hua
 There were frequent movements and many times these movements took violent forms
 rajya main abhootpurv jaateey hinsa kii sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Despite negotiations going on for a long time, no consensus was reached between the leaders of the movement and the central government, as this was a very complex issue
 yah tay karnaa aasaan nahin tha ki koun ‘bahari’ yaa videshi he or aise logon ko kahan bheja janaa chahie
 The central government decided to hold assembly elections in Assam in 1983
 lekin andolan se jude sanghathanon ne iskaa bahishkaar kiya
 Very few votes were cast in these elections
 jin kshetron main asamiya bhashi logon kaa bahumat tha, vahaan teen pratishat se bhi kam vot pade
 The state witnessed intense violence in the name of tribal, linguistic and communal identities in which more than three thousand people were killed
 chunaavon ke baad congress party kii sarkaar zarur bani, lekin ise koi loktantric vaidhata hasil nahin thi
 After the 1983 violence, the two sides again began to negotiate
 15 agast 1985 ko centre kii rajeev gandhi sarkaar or andolan ke netaaon ke bich samjhauta hua jise assam samjhaute ke naam se janaa gaya
 Under this, it was decided to give full citizenship and the right to vote to all those who came between 1951 and 1961
 tay kiya ki jo log 1971 ke baad assam main aaye the, unhen waapas bhej diya jayega
 People who came from 196 1 to 1971 were not given the right to vote, but they were given all other rights of citizenship
 assam ke aarthik vikaas ke liye package kii bhi ghoshnaa kii gayi or yahan oil rifinary, paper mil or takanic santhaan sthapit karne kaa faisalaa kiya gaya
 The central government also decided that it would take special legislation and administrative measures to protect the cultural, social and linguistic identity of Assamese-speaking people
 iske baad, is samjhaute ke aadhaar par matadaata-suchi main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 The Assembly was dissolved and elections were held in 1985, in which the newly formed Assam Gana Parishad got a majority
 party ke netaa prafull kumaar mahant, jo ki aasu ke adhyaksh bhi the, mukhyamantri bane
 He was only 32 at the time
 assam-samjhaute se vahaan lambe samay se chal rahi raajnneetik asthirataa kaa ant hua
 But even after 1985, the movement for a separate Bodo state continued
 isi tarah bharat se alag hokar asamiya logon ke liye ek alag raashtra kii maang ko lekar ulpha kaa sakriy, bhumigat or hinsak andolan bhi chalata rahaa
 The experience of the Assam Movement and the Assam Accord suggests that preventing outsiders from settling illegally is necessary, but removing what once settled is a very difficult task
 iske alaava pichhali kai pidiyon se rajya main bas chuke logon ko sirf unki dharmik yaa bhashaai pahchaan ke aadhaar par videshi kaa darja dene se ek tarah kii kattarta ko hi protsaahan miltaa he
 Even during the Assam movement, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh tried to give it the color of a campaign against the Muslims
 ullekhneey he ki jis mudde ko lekar assam andolan shuru hua tha, vah mudda or usase judi shikaayatein abhi tak puri tarah dur nahin ho paayi hai
 Apart from this, the feeling of intolerance towards other identities has increased in the society of Assam
 aisa sirf ‘musalmaan bengaaliyon’ ke sandarbh main hi nahin hua he, balki adivasee logon kii maangon ke kilaaf bhi ek tarah kii kattarta panpi he

 It was built in 1590 AD
 is mandir ke shila lekh se yah jaankaree puri tarah sunishchit ho jaati he ki is bhavy devalayas ko amer ke raja bhagwaan das ke putr raja maansingh ne banwaaya tha
 There is also a mention of the construction of the temple under the supervision of two Vaishnava gurus named Roop Goswami and Sanatana Goswami
 james fergusan, prasiddh itihaaskaar ne likhaa he ki yah mandir bharat ke mandiron main bada shandaar he
 The grandeur of the temple can be gauged from this quotation
 When Aurangzeb took a stroll in the evening, when asked about the far-sighted light in the south-east, it was revealed that this glow is of the magnificent temples of Vrindavan
 aurangzeb, mandir kii chamak se pareshaan tha, samaadhaan ke liye usne turant kaarywahi ke rup main sena bheji
 The temple was broken as much as it could be, and the rest built mosque walls, domes etc
 kehete hai aurangzeb ne yahan namaaz main hissaa liya
 The construction of the temple took 55 to 10 years and cost about one crore rupees
 samraat akbar ne nirmaan ke liye laal pathar diya
 In Mr
 Grouse's view, the Christian clergy of the Akbari court, who came from the countries of Europe, played a clear role in the construction that reflected the Greek cross and the European Church
 is mandir kii nirmaan style - hindu, jaipuri, mogul, unani or gothic kaa mishran he
 Its cost price - one crore rupees
 yah mandir 5-10 varshon main banakar taiyaar hua tha

 The Goswamis came to Vrindavan and did the first work to build a Vrinda temple in the name of Vrinda Devi
