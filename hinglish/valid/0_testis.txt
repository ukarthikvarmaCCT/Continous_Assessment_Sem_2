 Along with Sanskrit, you also studied Hindi poetry and music from Govindaswamy, which you used in the propaganda work
 gokulanath kii vaishnav jagat main khyaati ke visheshat: do kaaran bataae jate he
 The first reason is that he enforced the popular practice of giving communal teachings through the characterization of Vaishnava devotees of his sect
 in kathaon ko hi hindi sahitya main 'vaarta sahitya' kaa naam diya gaya he
 The second reason for your fame is known in communal rituals under the name 'malaprasang'
 is malaprasang ke kaaran, kaha jaataa he ki, gokulanath ji ko vaishnav jagat main sarvadeshik yash or sammaan praapt hua tha
 Malaprasang is related to a historical event
 vansat 1674 main badshaah jahangir kii ujjain or mathura main ek vedanti sanyasi chidrup se bhent hui jisaki visprih sadhana se badshaah mugdh tha
 It is prevalent among the Vaishnavas that at his behest the emperor banned the wearing of external symbols of the Vaishnavas
 is nishedhagna ko hatwane main gokulanath ji ne safalataa pai
 Although this Vaishnava tradition is not confirmed by historical texts
 jahangir ke 'aatmcharita' athwa farsi kii aitihaasik saamagree main is ghatana kaa kahin ullekh nahin miltaa
 But in the case of Gokulnath ji it is found that he got free pastures for the Goswamis from Jahangir
 unka yash or sammaan pushtimargi santasamaj main isse adhik bad gaya
 Whether or not Chidroop's popularity decreased, but Gokulnathji's influence continued to grow
 aage chalakar iskaa spasht prabhaav unki kritiyon par padaa
 His name is taken with great respect as a celebrated writer and preacher of dialogue literature
 vaishnav mat ke siddhanton or bhakthi kii rasanubhuti main unki lekhnee khub chali
 Gokulnathji has been mentioned in the history texts of Hindi literature because of his 'dialogue literature'
 gokulanath rachit do vaarta granth praapt hai
 The first is the 'chaurasi Vaishnavan talks' and the second 'two hundred fifty-two Vaishnavan talks'
 in donon kii pramanikta or gokulanath rachit hone main vidwaanon main prarambh se hi matbhed rahaa he, kintu naveenatam shodh or anushilan se yah siddh hota ja rahaa he ki mul vaartaon kaa kathan gokulanath ne hi kiya tha
 These talks have helped immensely in getting the introduction of Vallabh sectarian poets and Vaishnava devotees
 at: inako apramanik kahkar upekshniya nahin mana ja saktaa
 It is known from the study of communal traditions that Gokulnath ji first told the account of Sri Vallabhacharya's disciples-servants verbally as 'talks of fourteen Vaishnavans' and subsequently the character of the disciples-servants of his father Shri Vitthalanath
 Two hundred fifty-two Vaishnavan talks', although Gokulnath himself did not write these talks
 lekhan or sampadan kaa kaary baad main hota rahaa
 In particular, Gusai Hariray did the important work of editing them
 unhone 'bhav prakaash' likhakar in vaartaon kaa pallavan karte hue inamen vistaar ke saath katipay samasamyik ghatnaon kaa bhi samavesh kar diya
 It is especially noteworthy that Aurangzeb's attacks in these incidents
 vastut: hariraay ji ne apane kaal kii vartmaankalik ghatnaon ko bhav prakaashan tathaa pallavan ke samay joda tha
 Those were not events in the original negotiations
 parvarti sampadakon or lipikaron ne anek naveen prasang jodakar vaartaon ko bahut bhraamak bana diya he
 But in the earliest copies of the talks, many misconceptions are resolved due to non-description of those events
 vaarta sahitya kaa hindi gadhy ke kramik vikaas main bahut hi mahatvapurn sthaan he or ab unka vidhiwat moolyankan hone laga he
 There are also some other texts written by Gokulnath ji which include 'vanayatra', 'naitya-seva-type', 'sitting character', 'gharu talks', 'bhavana', 'comedy episode' etc
 gokulanath ji kii khyaati kaa ek kaaran unki sampradayik visheshta bhi he
 Gokulnath is the form of the presiding deity of Gokulnath and the place of his abode is Gokul
 inke yahan swarupaseva ke sthaan par gaddi ko hi sarvasv maanakar puja jaataa he
 His Sevakasamudaya Bhanduchi is famous as Vaishnavas
 gokulanath ji vachanamrita dwaara vallabh sampradaay kaa prachaar karanevaale sabase pramukh acharya the

 It has a thick and powerful bone called femur
 1947 The oldest available dictionary of Sanskrit is the Vedic 'nighantu'
 uskaa rachanakaal kam se kam 700 yaa 800 i0 pus0 he
 The collection of Vedic words was called 'nighantu'
 'yask' kaa nirukt vaidic nighantu kaa bhashya he
 It is the only Nighantu available in the Ninghts preceding Yask, but from 'nirukta' it appears that many Nighuntu were formed before 'yask'
 at: kah sakate hai ki kam se kam i0 pus0 1000 se hi nighantu koshon kaa sampadan hone laga tha
 For detailed information see Nighantu and Nirukta
 vaidic nighantukoshon or 'nirukt granthon' ke ananthar sanskrit ke pracheen or madhyakaalin kosh hamen uplabdh hote hai
 In this connection, 'mekdanald' has assumed that the tradition of Sanskrit lexicon originated from metal texts and ganpaths
 panineey ashtaadhi ke poorak paarishisht rup main dhaatuon or ganashabdon kaa vyakarnopayogi sangrah in uparyukt paathon main hua
 However, it would be more expedient to call them only the index and the list because they do not have the instructions
 aage chalakar sanskrit ke adhikansh koshon main jis prakaar rachanavidhan or arthnirdesh style kaa vikaas hua he vah dhatupath yaa ganapth kii style se purnatah pruthak he
 Their form is also different from the Nighantu texts
 nighantuon main vaidic shabdon kaa sangrah hota tha
 Verbs, nouns and avayas were also compiled in them
 parantu sanskrit koshon main mukhyatah keval namapadon or avyayon kaa hi sangrah hua
 It does not have etymology as similar to 'nirukta' or 'mahavyutpatti' dictionary of Pali
 vaidic nighantuon main sangruhit shabdon kaa sambandh praayah vishisht granthon se hota ta
 They were composed in prose
 parantu sanskrit kosh mukhyatah padyatmak he or pramukh rup se unamem anushtup chand kaa yoga hua he
 Words and meanings have been introduced by Sanskrit lexicons: Dhananday, Dharni 'and' Maheshwar ', etc
 The purpose of the creation of the lexicon was probably to create a collection of important rare and poetical words
 sanskrit koshon kaa aitihaasik simhavlokan karne se hamen is vishay ko saamaanya jaankaree praapt ho sakati he
 In this regard, scholars have divided the Sanskrit dictionary into three periods on the same basis, keeping the 'namalinganushasan', most popular and composed by 'amarsingh'
 'amarsingh' ke purvavarti koshon kaa unke namalinganushasan' main ullekh nahin miltaa he
 But on the basis of the sound of the 'samyakatrayanatantrani', the use of the antecedents in the composition of 'amarkosh' can be inferred
 'amarkosh' kii ek tikaa main labdh 'kaatya' shabd ke aadhaar par 'kaatya' yaa 'katyayan' naamak 'amar-purvavarti koshkar kaa or pathantar ke aadhaar par vyadi naamak koshaakaar kaa anumaan hota he
 On the basis of the commentary ‘kshirswami’ of ‘amarkosh’, there is an indication of a Vaidhyak Nighantu called ‘dhanvatarpinighantu’ of ‘dhanvantari’
 'maharashtra shabdkosh' kii bhoomika main 'bhaguri' kekosh ko bhi—jiskaa 'trikandkosh' tha—'amar-purvavati' bataaya gaya he
 This dictionary is mentioned in a book of South India even today
 'ranti yaa 'rantidev' or 'rasabh' yaa 'rasabhpal' ko bhi 'amar-purvavarti' koshkar kaha gaay he
 'sarvanand' has stated in his commentary on 'amarkosh' that there is only a collection of genders in the dictionaries of 'vyadi' and 'varruchi' etc
 and only words in 'trikand' and 'utpilani'
 parantu 'amarkosh' main donon kii visheshtaayen ekatra sanmilit hai
 Thus Kshiraswami of many lexicons like 'vyadi', 'varruchi' 'bhaguri' and 'dhanvantari', introduced immortal-preceding lexicons and immortal-preceding lexicons like 'trikand', 'utplini', 'ratnakosh' and 'mala' etc
 is
 amarkosh kii mahataa ke kuch kaaran hai
 Although the erstwhile phrasings are not available today, it is estimated that in ancient lexicons, two types of styles used to refer to certain phrasal names and some to gender
 inhen namatantra tathaa lingatantr kaha jaataa tha
 The main topic was the critical direction of gender in the lexicons of the second genre
 par 'amarsingh ne apane kosh main donon kaa ek saath atyant praudh sangyojan or vivechan kiya he
 In the beginning, he has given clear instructions about the rules and method used in his dictionary from the third to the fifth verse
 inke aadhaar par shabdaarth ke saath hi saath ling kaa nirnay bhi hota he
 This book of three scandals has ten, ten and five sections respectively
 upkram bhaag main nirdisht paddati ke anusaar namapadon ke ling kaa aadyant nirdesh kiya gaya he
 That is why its designation is 'namalinganushasan'
 isaki vishistataa kaa parichay dete hue swayan granthkaar ne bataaya he ki anya tantron se vivechy vishay kaa samaahaar karte hue sankshipt rup main or pratisanskaar dwaar utkrisht rup se virgon main vibhakt—is namalinganushasan' ko purna banane kaa prayaas hua he
 That is its specialty
 suvyavisthit paddhit ke anusaar candon or virgon kaa vibhaajan kiya gaya he
 In fact, the first two cases present synonyms of this dictionary and in the third case there is a collection of names other than nature
 visheshyanighn varg main visheshya- nusaari lingadi main prayukt honevaale namapadon kaa sangrah he
 In the 'narrow' class, the meaning of Prakriti Pratidhi is discussed in the Oha of gender
 nanarth' varg main nanarth naamon kaa 'kaant', 'khant' aadi kram ke anusaar sangrah kiya gaya he
 The fourth class is the compilation of non-volatile words and the maximum class is called lingadisangraha and in it the discipline of gender is mainly and secondarily based on the classical and grammatical normative basis and other serial-ordered method of gender instruction
 yah koshgranth mukhyatah paryaayavachi hi he
 Nevertheless, the door of the third episode, which we can call an appendix in the modern phrase, has been made full and comprehensive and useful in this dictionary
 amarparvarti kaal main sanskrit koshon kii anek vidhaayen lakshith hoti hai - In addition to these genres, such dictionaries are also found in which the words monosyllabic, dialect, tyachar and diacritic are arranged in a systematic way

Production of two prototypes began in February 1965: 001, manufactured by Aerospaceale in Toulouse, and 002, by BAC in Filton Bristol
 The Concorde 001 completed its first test flight from Toulouse on 2 March 1969, whose pilot was Andre Tarkat, and the first supersonic ran on 1 October
 The first uk-made Concorde Filton to RAF Fairford was flown on 9 April 1969 by Pilot Brian Trabshaw

 Environmental concerns such as plane crashes and sonic booms, take-off noise and pollution
 Four countries remained potential buyers until 1976: Britain, France, China and Iran
 In the end only Air France and British Airways took their orders, where both governments shared the profits earned

 concord ne nimnlikhit praudyogikiyon kaa bidaa uthaaya: For high speed and customization of flight: vajan kii bachat or vardhit nishpaadan ke liye: When an aircraft crosses the critical direction of that particular airframe, the center of pressure moves backwards
 yah vimaan par pich adhomukhi bal kaa kaaran banataa he, kyonki dravyaman kaa centre apni jagah par hi bana rahata he
 Engineers designed the wings in a specific way to minimize this change

 This could have been prevented by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds it was likely to have dramatically increased the dredging of the aircraft

 The intake design of the Concorde engine was important

5 maakh ke aas-paas hi hawa le sakate hai; isliye hawa ko maakh 2,0 vayugati se dhimaa karnaa padataa he jo ingine antargrahan main pravesh karti he
 In particular, Concorde needed to control the shock waves arising from the lack of speed, to protect the engines from damage
 yah antargrahan ramp or ek sahaayak spil dwaar kii jodi ne kiya, jiske sthaan ko udaan ke dauraan khiskaaya gaya taaki hawa ko neeche dhimaa kiya ja sake
 The ramps were above the engine compartment and moved downward and the auxiliary spill gate was moving both up and down, allowing air to flow in and out
 antargrahan pranali kii prabhaavashiltaa aisi he ki supersonic udaan ke dauraan, vimaan kaa 63% jor ke liye uske antargrahan ko jimmedaar tehraaya he jabaki tontiyon ne jor kaa 29% or injanon ne sirf 8%
 utpann kiya
 Engine failures pose problems for conventional subsonic aircraft; The aircraft not only loses power in that direction but also generates engine dredging, causing a deviation in the aircraft and turning in the direction of the failed engine
 yadi aisa supersonic gati par concord ke saath hota he, to saidhantik rup se vah airfrem kii apati vifaltaa kaa kaarak banataa he
 However, the need for air ingestion during engine failure remains almost zero, so the immediate effects of engine failure at Concorde were prevented by the opening of auxiliary spill gates and the full expansion of the ramps, which diverted the air downward across the engine
 And reduced the dredging effect of the failed engine, earning lift and aligning the engine

 The fuselage is 300 mm, due to the heat generated by the air pressure during the travel supersonically by the Concorde
 By far, the most obvious manifestation of this was the flight engine's opening gap between the console and the mural on the flight deck
 sabhi concord par jinamein supersonic prasthaan udaan paras flite ejeeniyar uske thanda hone se pehle is antaraal main apni topi rakhte the, jahaan unki tapiyaan abhi bhi rakhi hai

 supersonic udaan ke dauraan cockpit se aage kii satahen garm ho gayi, is taap ko cockpit tak sidhe pahunchane se vikshepit karne ke liye ek agrabhag kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 The councils were also banned in Concord; Most of the surface had to be painted with extremely white reflective paint to protect the aluminum structure from overheating due to the supersonic heating effects of 2 mah
 However, in 1996, Air France temporarily painted F-BTSD as part of a promotional deal with Pepsi Cola, mainly in blue
 In this color scheme, Air France was advised to stay on 2 mah for not more than 20 minutes, but there was no restriction on speed under 1

 The higher the speed at which the Concorde traveled, the more forces were applied to the aircraft's structure during climbs and curves
 iske kaaran vimaan sanrachana main anthan or virupan hua
 There were also concerns about maintaining precise control over supersonic speeds; Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between outside and within elevon

 The Concorde needed to travel between London and New York or Washington non-stop, and to achieve this, the designers gave the Concorde a maximum supersonic range than any other aircraft

 Nevertheless, soon after the Concorde took flight, a Concorde "B" model with slightly larger wings, including slightly more fuel capacity and front edge straps was envisaged to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds

 Concorde's maximum cruising altitude was 60,000 feet; Subsonic cruise ships are typically below 40,000 feet
 Above 50,000 feet, the pressure of the athlete over 10-15 seconds will give any lack of air conditioned even in a "useful" consciousness of time
 a cabin breach can also cause the outside venturi plane pressure to decrease below ambient air pressure as the air is sucked out through an opening
 The height is on the concord, the air density is very low; An effective jet violation of the cabin will not result in severe enough pressure to damage passenger oxygen so that plastic masks are installed on other emergency and passengers will suffer from hypoxia despite donning them early
 Concord, Therefore was equipped with small windows to reduce the damage rate of a breach in a reserved air supply system to increase the pressure of the cabin and a rapid gradient process to bring a safe elevation to the cabin

 The FAA enforces minimum operating descent rates for aircraft and operating high altitude notes made Concorde, concluding that the best descent will be a rapid response to a loss of pressure
 The pilots' lung crew was forced to use high pressure oxygen masks at constant positive airway pressure which is used

 During the Concorde, a landing approach would increase the nose setting rate "backwards", where the drag force curve was submerged
 The size of the delta allowed Concord to achieve a higher angle of attack than conventional wing aircraft, as it allowed the upper wings of the surface to reduce pressure on the entire vortex, allowing the construction to maintain a large lift

 The US Congress had just banned Concorde landings in the US, mainly due to civil protests over sound booms, preventing launch on the iconic transatlantic routes
 However, the US Secretary of Transportation, William Coleman, gave British Airways and Washington permission for the Concorde service to Dulles International Airport, and Air France together

 The ban came to an end on October 17 in 1977, when the United States Supreme Court's ban reversed a lower court ruling over efforts to dismiss the ruling from port authorities and a grass-roots campaign led by Berman Carroll 
 Despite complaints about noise, the noise report stated that at one time the Air Force, a Boeing 137-VC, had been louder than Concorde at subsonic speeds and during takeoff and landing

 Upon his return, Beckwith presented a detailed report on the Army's vulnerability when it was not a sas-type unit
 American special forces at the time focused on unconventional warfare but Beckwith recognized the need for highly autonomous teams mastered in direct action and countering terrorism
 He briefed the army and government officials who were initially against creating any units outside the hierarchy of special forces

 praatishakhya shabd kaa arth he : "prati arthath tattat shakha se sambandh rakhanevaala shaastra athwa adhyayan"
 "branch" here means the branches of the Vedas
 vaidic shakhaon se sambhddha vishay anek ho sakate the
 For example, rituals, ethics, etc
 associated with each Vedic branch had its own tradition
 un sab vishyon se praatishakhyon kaa sambandh na hokar keval vaidic mantron ke shuddh uccharan, vaidic samhitaon or unke padpaathon aadi ke sadhiprayukt varnaparivartan athwa swarparivartan ke parsparik sambandh or kabhi kabhi chandovichaar jaise vishyon se tha
 In terms of education, historical development of grammar and protection of the traditional text of the related Vedic codes, the proofs are of utmost importance
 yahan vaidic shakhaon ke prarambh, swaroop or pravriti ko sankshep main samaj lenaa aavashyak he
 There was a time in the history of Indian Vedic culture when Vedic mystics stored traditional Vedic mantras as Vedic codes
 us samay adhyayanadhyaapan kaa aadhaar keval maukhik tha
 The Vedic codes could have been protected only by the Sravana tradition of Guru Shishya
 deshbhed or kalbhed se vaidic samhitaon kii kramash: vibhinn shakhaayen ho gayi
 Vedic mantras and their codes have been considered as the holiest treasures of the Aryan race from the beginning
 unki suraksha or adhyayan kii ore arya manishiyon kaa sadaa se dhyaan rahaa he
 This vision gave rise to Vedic intrigues in India
 vaidic samhitaon kii suraksha or arthgyan kii drushti se hi vaidic vidwaanon ne tattat samhitaon ke padpath kaa nirmaan kiya
 After some time, respectively, the recitation of the text etc
 also started
 veda ke shadangon ke vikaas ke saath-saath prayek shakha kaa yah praytn rahaa ki vah apni apni parampara main vaidic samhitaon ke shuddh uccharan kii suraksha kare or padpath evam yathasambhav krampath kii sahaayta se veda ke prayek pad ke swaroop kaa or samhita main hone vaale un padon ke varnaparivartanon or swarparivartanon kaa yatharthat: adhyayan kare
 Originally this was the subject of the protests
 kabhi kabhi chandovishyak adhyayan bhi praatishakhya kii paridhi main aa jaataa tha
 The fellows of the Vedic branches were called "charan"
 in charnon kii vidvatsabhaon yaa vidyasabhaaon ko "parishad" kaha jaataa tha
 Statutes were often composed in the sutra style, hence the practice of "parshadasutra" for the exponents is often found in ancient texts
 yaskacharya ke nirukt main kaha gaya he : That is, the Samhita is based on the posts and the trend of the Pratyaksha of all branches has been to consider the posts as the basis of the Samhita
 isse yah dhwani nikalati he ki pracheen kaal main sab vaidic shakhaon ke apane-apane praatishakhya rahe honge
 Probably similar to the Vedic branches, their primordials also disappeared
 vartmaan uplabdh vishisht praatishakhya neeche die jate hai
 Apparently it is related to the Samhita of the Rigveda
 par parampara ke anusaar isko rigvedic shakal shakha kii avaantar shishiriya shakha se sabanddh batalaaya jaataa he
 It is the largest of the principals and holds its special significance in many respects
 isamen chah-chah patalon ke teen adhyay hai
 Here and the Pratikshakhya Sutras are in style, there it is produced in verses
 par vyakhyakaaron ne padyon ko tukdon main vibhakt kar sutararup main hi unki vyakhya kii he
 The first 1-15 chapters of this chapter describe topics related to education and grammar, and the last three chapters discuss verses
 chhandon ke vishay kaa pratipaadan, yah dhyaan main rakhane kii baat he, kisi anya praatishakhya main nahin he
 The detailed rendering of the sequence is also a notable feature of this pattern

 Translations are available in French by REA and in German by Prof

 It is produced in the formula style

 In addition to the main topic, the rules of the tone of the verses and the rules of Avagraha are specifically given in the text
 is praatishakhya kaa ek vaishishty yah bhi he ki isamen panini kii ghu, gha jaisi sangyaaon ke samaan "sim', "jit' aadi anek kritrim sangyaayen di hui hai
 Many of its sutras are integral to Panini's formulas
 anya anek pracheen aacharyon ke saath saath inamen shaunak acharya kaa bhi ullekh he
 The ancient interpretation of Uvat, along with other commentaries, is famous for this
 iskaa professor e

 yah bhi sutarastyli main nirmit he
 It has 24 chapters

 One of its features is that it mentions 20 ancient masters
 isaki kai pracheen vyakhyaayein, tribhashyaratna prasiddh hai
 English translations of Professor Whitney are available
 iskaa aalochanatmak sanskaran, angreji anuwaad ke sahit, pro hvitni ne 1862 main prakashit kiya tha
 It belongs to the Shaunak branch of the Atharvaveda
 yah bhi sutarastyli main or chaar adhyyon main he
 Apart from these, a Sam Pratyakhyakya by the name of Raktantra and a second Atharva Pratyakhyakha has been published in three readers
 praatishakhyon kii rachana panini acharya se purvakaal kii he
 All his vision looks before Panini grammar
 ho saktaa he, unke uplabdh granthon par kahin-kahin panini vyakaran kaa prabhaav ho, par yah bahut hi kam maatra main he
 It is a matter of remembering that in the Mahabhashya, Paninian grammar is called sarva-veda-parishad Shastra
 yadhyapi praatishakhyon ke aalochanatmak adhyayan or prakaashan main idhar vidwaanon ne, visheshat: paashchaatya vidwaanon ne, vishesh ruchi dikhalaai he, shatabdiyon se in granthon ke adhyayanadhyaapan kii parampara main hraas or shithily baraabar badhata hua prathit hota he
 This is the reason why many texts are incorrect or unclear in the expositions and also in their interpretations
 yahi kaaran he ki rugveda samhita ke sayan bhashya jaise mahan granth main kadachit ek baar bhi rugvedapraatishakhya kaa ullekh nahin he or kai sthanon par anek padon kii sandhi balaat paninisutra se siddh karne kaa ytn kiya gaya he
 It is required that Vedic codes should be studied in the light of the expositions

 Arabic: علي ابن أبي طالب ali ibne abi talib kaa janm 17 march 600 musalamaanon ke tirth sthal kaaba ke andar hua tha
 He was the brother-in-law and brother-in-law of Prophet Muhammad and his popular name is Hazrat Ali
 ve musalamaanon ke khalipha ke rup main jane jate hai
 He ruled from 656 to 661 as the fourth caliph of Rashidun Khilafat, and according to Shia Islam, he was the first Imam from 632 to 661
 iske atirikt unhen pehla muslim vaigyanik bhi mana jaataa he
 He gave scientific information in a very interesting manner to the common man
 abu talib or fatima bin asad ke liye paidaa hue, kai shastreey islamic ke anusaar, islam main sabase pavitra sthaan makka main kaaba ke pavitra abhayaarany main paidaa hone vaala ali akelaa vyakti he
 Sources, especially Shia ones
 ali pehla purush tha jisane islam ko sweekaar kiya, or kuch lekhakon ke mutabik pehla muslim tha
 Ali protected Muhammad from an early age and took part in almost all the battles fought by the nascent Muslim community
 madina main jane ke baad, usne mohammad kii beti fatima se vivaah kiya
 After the assassination of Caliph Uthman ibn Afan, he was appointed a caliph by Muhammad's companions in 656
 ali ke shasankaal main naagarik yuddh hue or 661 main, do dinon baad shahid hone ke kaaran kupha ke mahaan masjid main prarthana karte hue kharijite ne un par hamalaa kiya or hatya kar di 
 Ali is important for both Shia and Sunni politically and spiritually
 ali ke bare main kai jeevani strot aksar sampradayik rekhaon ke anusaar pakshpatpurna hote hai, lekin ve is baat se sahamat hai ki vah ek pavitra muslim tha, jo islam ke kaaran or quran or sunnat ke anusaar ek shaasha tha

 Ali said, 'was it appropriate that we should quarrel with the Caliph before the Prophet was buried?' khilaafat ke chunaav ke baad, abu bakar or umr kuch anya saathi ke saath fatima ke ghar gaye or ali or unke samarthakon ko majaboor karne ke liye majaboor kiya jo abu bakar ko apana nishtha dene ke liye ikatthe hue the

 Abu Bakr said to him, "the Apostle of Allah said, We have no successors, everything we leave is Sadaka
 " umm ayman ke saath milakar, ali ne is tathy kii gavaahi di ki mohammad ne ise fatima jehar ko diya, jab abu bakar ne unase apane daawey ke liye gavaahon ko bulaava dene kaa anurodh kiya
 Fatima became angry and stopped talking to Abu Bakr, and he kept following the attitude until she died
 'aisha ne yah bhi kaha ki "jab allaah ke preshit kii mrityu ho gai, to unki patniyon ne uthman ko abu bakar ko bhejne ke liye kaha ki vah viraasat ke apane hisse ke liye kahen

 saad ebn abi vakkaas or abdur rahamaan bin Awf, jo chachere bhai the, swaabhaavik rup se uthman kaa samarthan karne ke icchhuk the, jo abdur rahamaan ke damaad the
 In addition, Umar voted casting Abdur Rahman

 Ali rejected the third condition while Uthman accepted it

 At this time, Ali acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him
 kai avasaron par ali ne udhman ke saath hudud ke aavedan main asahmat; unhone saarvajanik rup se abu dhrar al-ghifaari ke liye sahanubhuti dikhaayi thi or ammar ebn yasir kii raksha main dridhtaa se baat kii thi
 He told Uthman about criticisms of other allies and acted as negotiator on behalf of Uthman with provincial opponents who had come to Medina; This seems to have caused some mistrust between Ali and Uthman's family
 aakhirkaar, unhone gheraabandi kii gambhirtha ko apane aagrah se kam karne kii koshish kii ki uthman ko pani kii anumati di jaani chahie
 There is a dispute among historians about the relationship between Ali and Uthman

 In particular, he clashed with Uthman over the question of religious law

 Ali attempted to protect mates from motherhood by a caliph like Ibn Masood

 muslim itihaas main sabase kathin avadhi main se ek ke dauraan, ali 656 or 661 ke bich khalipha tha, jo ki pehle fitnh ke saath bhi hua tha
 Since the conflicts in which Ali was involved were perpetuated in polar communal historiography, biographical material is often biased
 lekin sutara is baat se sahamat hai ki vah ek gahan dharmik vyakti tha, jo islam ke kaaran or quran or sunnat ke anusaar nyaay kaa shashan tha; vah dharmik kartavyon ke maamle main musalamaanon ke khilaaf yuddh main lage the

 Uthman's assassination meant that the rebels had to choose a new caliphate
 yah kathinaaiyon se mulaakaat kii kyonki vidrohiyon ko muhjirun, ansaar, misravasi, kufaan or basrite samet kai samoohon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha 
 There were three candidates: Ali, Talhah and al-zubair
 sabase pehle vidrohiyon ne ali se sampark kiya, chauthe khalif hone ke liye unhen anurodh karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Some of Muhammad's companions tried to persuade Ali to accept office, but he turned down the offer, suggesting to be a consultant rather than a chief
 talha, jubayre or anya saathi ne khalipha ke vidrohiyon ke prastaav se inkaar kar diya
 Therefore, the rebels warned the residents of Medina to elect a caliphate within a day, or they would implement drastic action
 dedlock ko hal karne ke liye, muslim al-masjid en- naabavi main 18 june, 656 ko khalipha niyukt karne ke liye ekatra hue 
 Initially, 'ali refused to accept it, as only his most powerful supporters were rebels
 haalanki, jab madina ke nivaasiyon ke alaava mohammad ke kuch ullekhneey saathi ne unhen prastaav sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya, to vah antat sahamat hue
 According to Abu Mekhnaf's narration, Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge to 'ali, but other legends claimed otherwise that he was forced to give his vows
 iske alaava, talhah or ez-jubayre ne baad main daawa kiya ki unhone unhen anichhaa se samarthan diya he
 Regardless, Ali rejected these claims, insisting that they recognized them as sloppy
 wilferd madelang kaa maananaa he ki bal ne logon se pratigya dene kaa aagrah nahin kiya or unhone masjid main saarvajanik rup se vachan diya
 While many of the rebels, along with the population of Medina, gave their vows, some important figures or tribes did not

 Saad ibn Abi Waqqas was absent and 'abdullah ibn' Umar stopped offering his allegiance, but the two assured 'ali that they would not act against him
 is prakaar ali ne rashidun khaliphot ko viraasat main mila - jo pashchim main misr se purv main irani pahadiyon tak failaa tha- jabaki hejaj or anya praanton kii sthiti main unke chunaav kii purv sandhya par sthiti pareshaan nahin thi
 Soon after becoming Ali Khalifa, he rejected the provincial governors whom Uthman had appointed, replacing them with trusted allies

 aisi paristhitiyon main, ek vivaad hua jisane muslim itihaas main pehla grih yuddh shuru kiya
 Some Muslims, known as Uthmanis, considered Uthman to be a rightful and just caliph until the end, who was killed illegally
 kuch anya, jinhen ali kii party ke naam se janaa jaataa he, kaa maananaa tha ki uthman galati main gir gaya tha, unhone khalipha ko jabt kar liya tha or kanoonee tareeke se apane tareeke se sudhaarney yaa kadam uthaane ke inkaar karne ke liye kanoon main nishpadit kiya tha; is prakaar ali sirf sahi or sachche imam the or unke virodhiyon main naastik
 This was not Ali's position himself

 The Iraqis wanted the newly established Islamic State capital to be in Kufa so that they could bring in revenue to their territory and oppose Syria
 unhone ali ko kupha main aane or iraq main kupha main rajdhani sthapit karne ke liye aashwast kiya
 Later Muawiyah I, the governor of the Levant and cousin of Uthman, refused Ali's demands for loyalty

 Finally, Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa
 amrit ebn al- e ko muvayah ne madhyasth ke rup main niyukt kiya tha
 Seven months later the two mediators met in Jordan 658, 10 miles northwest of Mann, in Jordan
 amrit ebn al- abu musa ashaari ne aashwast kiya ki ali or muvayah donon ko kadam uthaanaa chahie or ek nayaa khalipha chune jane chahie
 Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision, which reduced the caliphate to the status of rebel Mu'awiyah
 isliye ali ko muvayah or amrit ebn al-es ne bulaayaa tha
 When the arbitrators gathered at daumit-ul-jandal, a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss matters
 jab khalipha ke bare main nirnay lene ke liye samay aayaa, amrit bin al-aas ne abu musa al-ashaari ko is baat kaa manoranjan karne main vishwaas dilaayaa ki unhen khalipha ke ali or muvaaya donon ko vanchit karnaa chahie, or musalamaanon ko chunaav karne kaa adhikaar dena chahie khalipha abu musa al-ashaari ne tadnusaar kaary karne kaa bhi faisla kiya

 amrit ne muvayah kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki abu musa ne apane damaad abdulla ebn umr ko pasand kiya, lekin baad vaale ne sarvasammati se chunaav ke liye khadey hone se inkaar kar diya
 Abu Musa proposed, and Amrit agreed, to leave both Ali and Mu'awiyah and submit a selection of the new Caliph to Shura
 abu musa ke baad saarvajanik ghoshnaa main samjhaute ke apane hisse ko dekha gaya, lekin amrit ne ali ko ghoshit kar diya or muvaaya ko khalipha ke rup main pushti kii
 Ali refused to accept his decision and found it technically in breach of his pledge to hold elections and to follow arbitration
 'ali ne virodh kiya, yah bataate hue ki yah quran or sunnat ke vipareet taur isliye badhyakaari nahin tha
 He then tried to organize a new army, but the Qasr's remnant Ansar, led by Malik Ashtar, and some of his clans remained loyal
 isane ali ko apane samarthakon ke bich bhi ek kamjor sthiti main daal diya
 Mediation resulted in the disintegration of 'ali's alliance, and some have stated that this was Muawiyah's intention
 ali ke shivi main sabase mukhar virodhiyon ne vahi log the jinhone ali ko yudhviram main majaboor kar diya tha
 He broke through Ali's force, rallying under resentment "mediation belongs to God alone

 While dealing with the Iraqis, Ali found it difficult to build a disciplined army and effective state institutions

 muvayah ne misr, hijaaj, yaman or anya kshetron ko parajeet kiya
 In the last year of Ali's caliphate, the mood in Kufa and Basra changed in their favor as people became confused with Mu'awiyah's reign and policies
 haalanki, ali ke prati logon kaa ravaiya gaharaai se bhinn tha
 Only a small minority of them believed that Ali was the best Muslim after Muhammad and was only entitled to rule over them, while the majority supported him because of his mistrust and opposition to Mu'awiyah
 kaha jaataa he ki ali ne uthman kii maut ke baad khalipha main safal hone ke liye janata dwaara dabaae jane ke baad khalipha ke rankon main vittiya bhrashtachar or anuchit visheshadhikaron ke khilaaf ek asangat abhiyaan kii shapath lee or aagaah kiya

 apane governor malik ashtar ko ek prasiddh patr main, unhone apane samarthak garib virdohi virdohi drushtikon ko vyakt kiya: Remember that dislike and disapproval of ordinary men, acceptance of important persons and resentment of some of the larger ones do not bother more people than imbalances, if the general public and public relations of your subject are happy with you
