praarambhik bhugol sirf sthanon kaa varnan karata tha
 Although it is still included in the study of geography, there has been a change in the description of its patterns in the last few years
 bhugolic parighatnaon kaa varnan saamanytah do upagamon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he jaise pradeshik or krambaddh
 Explains the creation and characteristics of territorial approach areas
 yah is baat kaa varnan karne kaa prayaas karata he ki koi kshetra kaise or kyon ek duusare se alag he
 The state can be physical, social, economic, political, demographic etc
 krambaddh upaagam parighatnaon tathaa saamaanya bhugolic mahatvon ke dwaara sanchalit he
 Each phenomenon is studied on the basis of geography, regional variations and their relationship with each other
 bhugol kii praayah sabhi shakhaon vishesh rup se bhautik bhugol kii shakhaon main tathyon ke vishleshan main ganitiya vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Scientific study of celestial bodies is done in astronomy
 bhootal kii ghatnaon or tatwon par akashiya pindon - surya, chandramaa, dhoomaketuon aadi kaa pratyaksh prabhaav hota he
 That is why geography studies the solar system, the movement of the sun on its virtual path, the daily and annual movements of the earth and the changes that occur as a result - day and night and season changes, lunar arts, solar eclipse, lunar eclipse, etc
 in tatwon or ghatnaon kaa moulik adhyayan khagol vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 Thus geography has a closer relationship with astronomy
 bhu-vigyaan prithvi ke sanghathan, sanrachana tathaa itihaas ke vaigyanik adhyayan san sambandhit he
 This includes the study of the constituents of the earth, the forces acting on the surface and the structures produced from them, the structure and distribution of the crustacean rocks, geological periods of the earth, etc
 bhugol main sthalroopon ke vishleshan main bhuvigyaan ke siddhanton tathaa saakshyon kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 In this way, physical geography, especially geomorphology, has a very close relationship with geology
 bhootal ko prabhavit karne vaale bhugolic karkon main jalwaayu sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee or mahatvapurn kaarak he
 Meteorology studies the atmosphere, especially the physical processes occurring in it and the various processes related to the associated lithosphere and hydrosphere
 iske antargat vayudab, taapmaana, pawan, ardrata, varshan, meghachhadan, surya prakaash aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 These elements of meteorology are also analyzed in geography
 jal vigyaan prithvi par sthit jal ke adhyayan se sambandhit he
 Along with this, it also contains the study of water exploration, use, control and conservation
 mahasagariya tatwon ke sthanik vitaran kaa adhyayan bhugol kii ek shakha samudr vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 Oceanography involves the study of ocean water temperature, density, salinity, ocean waves, currents, etc
 maanav jivan main jalaashyon kaa mahatv sarvopari he kyonki pine se lekar pashuon ke pine, fasalon kii sinchai karne, kaarkaanon main jalaapurti, jalashakti, jal parivahan, matsyakhet aadi vibhinn roopon main jal aavashyak hi nahin anivaary hota he
 Thus we find that there is a very close and close relationship between geography and hydrology
 mrudaa vigyaan mitti ke nirmaan, sanrachana or visheshta kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karata he
 The distribution of soils on the ground floor is studied under soil geography
 mitti kaa adhyayan krishi bhugol kaa bhi mahatvapurn vishay he
 Thus, the closeness of geography is also found from soil science
 ped-paudhon kaa maanav jivan se gaharaa sambandh he
 Botany is the scientific study of plant life and its entire world forms
 prakritik vanaspatiyon ke sthanik vitaran or visheshtaon kaa vishleshan bhautik bhugol kii shakha jaev bhugol or upashakha vanaspati yaa padap bhugol main kii jaati he
 Animal science or zoology is the scientific study of the structure, classification and functions of all types of animal life
 manushya ke liye jantu jagat or pashu sansaadhan kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 Animals are very useful to humans
 manushya ko pashuon se anek upyogi padaarth yatha doodh, maance, oon, chamada aadi praapt hote hai or kuch pashuon kaa prayog saamaan dhone or parivahan yaa sawari karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Biogeography is a sub-branch of animal geography in which the spatial distribution and characteristics of various animals are analyzed
 maanav jivan ke aarthik, saamaajik, saanskrithik sabhi kshetron main pashu jagat kaa mahatvapurn sthaan hone ke kaaran isko bhugolic adhyayanon main bhi vishisht sthaan praapt he
 Therefore, geography has a close relationship with animal science
 bhojan, vastra or aashray manushya kii praathmik aavashyaktaaen hai jo kisi bhi desh, kaal yaa paristhiti main prayek vyakti ke liye anivaary hoti hai
 Along with this, there are other social, economic, political etc
 requirements of human or human group which are very much based on the economy
 arthvyavastha kaa adhyayan karnaa arthshaastra kaa mul vishay he
 Economy is the management, organization and administration of all the livelihood sources or economic resources of a place, region or community
 vividh aarthik pakshon kaa sthanik adhyayan bhugol kii ek vishisht shakha aarthik bhugol main kiya jaataa he
 Sociology is the study of social life, behavior and social action of human beings, which includes the study of the origin, development, structure and social institutions of human society
 samajashaastra maanav samaaj ke vikaas, pravriti tathaa niyamon kii vaigyanik vyakhya karata he
 The entire human society is divided into many classes, groups and communities which have their own customs, customs, traditions and rules on which the influence of geographical environment is definitely found
 atah samajashastreey adhyayanon main bhugolic gyaan aavashyak hota he
 Human geography studies the history of human civilization and the development of human society in geographical perspective
 kisi bhi desh yaa pradesh ke itihaas par vahaan ke bhugolic paryaavaran tathaa paristhitiyon kaa gaharaa prabhaav paaya jaataa he
 When we analyze natural and human or cultural facts from a developmental point of view, then there is an explanation of the changing relationship between man and earth
 kisi pradesh main jansankhya, krishi, pashupaalan, khanan, udyog dhandhon, parivahan ke sadhano, vyapaarik evam vanijki sansthaaon aadi ke aitihaasik vikaas kaa adhyayan maanav bhugol main kiya jaataa he jiske liye upyukt sakshya or pramaan itihaas se hi praapt hote hai
 The 'governance system' is the focal point of the study of political science
 isamen vibhinan rashtron evam rajyon kii shashan pranaaliyon, sarkaron, antarrashtriya sambandhon aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Political geography is a branch of human geography that includes the study of the extent, extent of politically organized areas, their various components, subdivisions, governed territories, resources, internal and foreign political relations, etc
 maanav bhugol kii ek anya shakha bhuraajnneeti bhi he jiske antargat bhootal ke vibhinn pradeshon kii raajnneetik pranali vishesh rup se antarrashtiy raajnneeti par bhugolic karkon ke prabhaav kii vyakhya kii jaati he
 It is clear from these facts that geography and political science are closely related
 janankiki yaa janasankhyikee ke antargat jansankhya ke aakaar, sanrachana, vikaas aadi kaa parimanatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 In this, along with the collection, classification, evaluation, analysis and projection of population data, demographic models and procedures are also explained
 maanav bhugol or uski upashakha jansankhya bhugol main bhugolic paryaavaran ke sambandh main janankikeey prakramon tathaa pratirupon main paayi jane vaali kshetreey bhinnataaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Thus due to the subject analogy, there is a close relationship between geography and demography

 Its headquarters is located at Netaji Subhash Marg, Daryaganj New Delhi
 yah multah saahitiyik prakaashan he, parantu saahityetar vishyon kii shreshth moulik evam anudit kritiyaan bhi isane bahutayat se prakashit kii hai
 Rajkamal Prakashan was established on 28 February 1947
 us samay desh swatantra nahin hua tha lekin vibhaajan kii ashankaon ke bich aazaadee kii dastak saaf sunai de rahi thi
 During such transition period, this publication was started with a resolve to strengthen the cultural aspect of the country and underline the identity of Hindi language and society
 iske sansthaapak the hindi ke suprasiddh sahityakar dow0 devraj
 As the publication expanded, he called his brother Omprakash ji to conduct the publication and thus Omprakash ji became the managing director of Rajkamal Prakashan
 kaary kii drushti se omprakash ji hi raajakmal ke vaastavik sansthaapak siddh hue
 With his sharp knowledge and skill to communicate with the writers, he took Rajkamal to the heights of publication in a short time
 raajakmal prakaashan kaa vikaas ek privet limited sanstha ke rup main hua he
 It is not in the form of one's personal or ancestral property, but its ownership is determined on the basis of shares
 is prakaar aarambh main iskaa swaamitv aruna asaf ali ke paas tha
 She had difficulty in publishing this issue due to differences with Omprakash ji on some issues, when Sheela Sandhu's husband Hardev Sandhu bought most shares of this publication from her and in the event of some differences, the managing director of Omprakash ji After leaving the post, Sheela Sandhu took over the post of Managing Director despite being often unaware of the Hindi language
 omprakash ji ne apana swatantra prakaashan santhaan radhakrishna prakaashan ke naam se khol liya
 He had personal relationships with many writers and hence many eminent writers like Mohan Rakesh turned away from Rajkamal
 shila sandhu ko duhari-tihari kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, par unhone haar nahin maani
 Sheela Sandhu was a woman with a higher education and a world view, but difficulties were natural due to being away from the Hindi language and the Hindi speaking community
 aise samay main raajakmal prakaashan se namvar singh prakaashan salaahkaar ke rup main jude
 "from June 1, 1965, Namvar took full responsibility of looking after all the literary matters of Rajkamal
 unhen pustak-prakaashan ke nirnay ke atirikt 'nai kahaniyaan' evam 'aalochana' patrikaon kii nitiyon par bhi drushti rakhane ko kaha gaya
 "in the words of Sheila Sandhu herself", the role of the mentor of Namvar Singh, the master of magical oratory and teaching style, was as much necessary to me as Rajkamal in this difficult time
 " haalaanki unki bhoomika se achaanak sahitya kii dalgat va nijee raajnneeti kii samasya bhi uthi parantu dhire-dhire yah sab dur hua or raajakmal prakaashan unchaaiyon ko choota gaya
 Dr
 Namwar Singh played an important role in connecting Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi and Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma to Rajkamal Publications
 acharya hajaari prasad dvivedi kii pustak chaaru chandralekh kaa prakaashan pehle hi omprakash ji dwaara raajakmal se ho chukaa tha
 Now with the efforts of Namwar Singh, most of his and Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma's books were published with Rajkamal Prakashan
 swayan shila sandhu ne bhi apane drudh sankalp ke bal par hindi seekhney ke saath-saath anekanek lekhakon se acha judaav banaakar raajakmal se joda
 Rajendra Singh Bedi, Upendranath Ashk, Nemichandra Jain, Bhishma Sahni, Bharat Bhushan Agarwal, Nirmala, Suresh Awasthi, Sarveshwar Dayal Saxena, Nirmal Verma, Kunwar Narayan, Prayag, Raghuveer Sahai, Liladhar Jagudi, Manohar Shyam Joshi, Abdul Bismillah and Srilal Shukla Writers kept adding
 raajakmal prakaashan hindi sahitya jagat main ek saphaltam prakaashan santhaan ke rup main sthapit ho gaya
 Initially, people thought that with Sheela Sandhu being the managing director of Rajkamal, this publishing institute would be closed and Sandhu would start her family business motor parts shop here
 parantu apni karmthata evam drudh sankalpashiltaa se shila sandhu ne na keval yah ashanka dur kii, balki sumitranandan pant, bhagwati charan verma, harivansh raay bachchan, sooryakanth treepathi niraala, shivamangala singh suman, baba nagarjun or fanishwar nath renu kaa vishwaas bhi arjeet kiya or is prakaar raajakmal kii sthapit prasiddhi kaa vistaar kiya
 At that time there was no way of printing the books of Rajkamal Prakashan through electronic means
 shila sandhu hastlikhit pandulipiyaan sweekaar karti thim
 They were typed, then made proof in the letter press and then the author would give their recommendation on them
 lekhakon se pustakon ke mukhyansh, vigyaapan tathaa cover ke liye sampark kiya jaataa
 Authors were never discouraged from participating in the process of publishing their book
 bhartiya prakaashak sangh kii baithkon main shila sandhu ne apane bhar yah siddh karne kaa praytn bhi kiya ki lekhakon ke roylty khaaton ko paardarshee banaakar unke saath pragadh sambandh banaaya ja saktaa he
 However, the idea did not become popular among publishers
 us samay raajakmal prakaashan kii pustaken computer main nahin rahati thi or jab chaahe tab utani hi pratiyaan chhapakar bech lene jaisi koi baat nahin thi
 The book was kept safe in the miles-long self of the warehouse of the mercenaries, printed in the ream ream papers
 iske liye chamahi lekhe, 'kachi' suchiyaan taiyaar kerani padatin or pustakon ke shiraaze kii 'lei' khaane vaale dimakon se suraksha hetu niyamit dawaaon kaa chhidkaav karana hota
 In today's age these things may seem ridiculous but for the time it is true
 is prakaashan ke vikaas main mohan gupt kaa smaraneey yogadan rahaa
 Mohan Gupta, who came from Kolkata, gradually took over the work of editing and then he took up all the responsibilities related to editing, publishing and printing the book
 swayan shila sandhu unhen 'hindi prakaashan jagat ke sarvshereshth sampadak va prakaashan prabandhakon main ek' maanati hai
 After successful operation of this publishing institute for 30 years, Sheela Sandhu broke away from it and in 1994 Ashok Maheshwari took over the post of Managing Director
 unke sanchaalan main vartmaan samay tak raajakmal prakaashan hindi sahitya jagat main sarvshereshth prakaashan sanstha ke rup main vikaas path par agrasar he
 It is important that the value of books is not as balanced as before
 is betahasha moolyavriddhi ke atirikt bhi yadi koi antar aayaa he to vah yah he ki is prakaashan ke aarambhik samay main hi duuradrushti vaale sarjanaatmak evam dussahas kii had tak jane vaale omprakash ji ne 'raajakmal prakaashan par utkrisht gunvattta kii amit chhap chodi' jo prakashit pustakon kii rachanaatmakataa ke rup main to aaj bhi barkaraar he, parantu dher sari pustakon main prayukt kiye jane vaale atyant starhin kaagajon ke kaaran is kshetra kii gunvattta kaaphi had tak dhwast ho gayi he
 In a short time, this thick, very light paper, which reaches several times worse than newsprint, is constantly discounting the pride of Rajkamal
 raajakmal prakaashan ne shreshth lekhakon kii sampoorn rachanaaon ko krambaddh tathaa pramanik rup main uplabdh karaane hetu suyogy sampadakon ke dwaara unki rachanawali prakashit karne kii anuthi pahal kii
 Its first episode as a plan was Hazariprasad Dwivedi's Rachnavali, which was being edited by his son Mukund Dwivedi
 haalanki yah rachanawali kaaphi baad main prakashit ho paayi
 The first to be published was Rachnavali Sumitranandan Pant Rachnavali, for which Rajkamal Prakashan at that time had a happy coincidence of receiving pre-order and advance amount of pre-publication from the readers
 iske baad to anek shreshth lekhon kii rachanawaliyaan atyant utkrisht rup main prastut karke raajakmal ne is kshetra main kirtiman sthapit kar diya he
 Details of the creations published from here are visible in the following table
 saamaanya pathakon ke liye hindi sahitya kii pahunch ke kshetra main pustakon ke paperbaque sanskaran ke rup main mul pustak kii yathaavat prastuti kii pahal karke raajakmal ne ek tarah se pathakeey kranti utpann kar di
 Initially many people expressed doubts over the success of Paperbacks, fearing lack of literary interest in the readers
 parantu, jab muktibodh rachanawali kaa dwitiya sanskaran paperbax ke rup main bhi aayaa or prakaashan se purv hi uskaa teen chauthai hissaa bik gaya to isaki nihsandigdh safalataa akatya rup se pramanit ho gayi
 This paperback edition greatly increased the readership of serious literature and this experiment has now taken the form of an imperative with complete success
 in paperbaque sanskarnon kii duhari upyogita he
 One is their price is low, the second is doubled by giving pictures of famous artists' artworks on its cover
 iskaa aarambh bhi shila sandhu ne apni dwitiya putree ke sahyog se kiya tha
 Through Rajkamal Prakashan, two magazines such as 'criticism' and 'nayi Kahaniyan', which were able to secure a definite place in the history of Hindi literature, were also published
 'aalochana' kaa prakaashan multah aalochana kendrit ek tremasik saahitiyik patrika ke rup main oktober 1951 main aarambh hua tha
 Its founder editor was Shivdan Singh Chauhan
 kuch varshon tak iskaa sampadan ek sampadak mandal ke dwaara hua phir nandadulaare vaajapeyi iske sampadan se jude or sabase lambey samay tak namvar singh ke sampadan main yah patrika nikalati rahi
 After its publication was suspended in the last decade of the twentieth century, its publication started again in a new form from 2000 AD
 'nayi kahaniyaan' multah kahani-kendrit patrika thi
 The idea of its publication was that of Omprakash, the then managing director of Rajkamal Publications
 unhone apane prayatnon se is patrika ke prakaashan ke liye bhairav prasad gupt ko janvari 1960 main hi sampadak ke rup main niyukt kiya tathaa chaar maheene kii taiyaari ke baad may 1960 main iskaa praveshank aayaa
 Due to Bhairav prasad Gupta being in Allahabad, its publication started from Allahabad, but later it started being published from Delhi itself and Bhairav prasad Gupta also came to Delhi
 bhairav prasad gupt ne janvari 1963 tak 'nayi kahaniyaan' kaa sampadan kiya tathaa rachanaatmak shreshthata evam lokapriyata donon drushtiyon se use uplabdhi ke shikhar tak pahunchaaya
 The entry number of 'new Stories' was printed ten thousand copies and the second issue was printed twenty five thousand copies
 chathe ank tak main hi isaki prasar-sankhya pichahattar hajaar tak pahunch gayi thi
 After the departure of Bhairav prasad Gupta from editing 'nayi Kahaniyaan', it was published without an editor from February 1963 to April 63
 may 1963 ke 'varshganth visheshank' kaa sampadan mannu bhandari ne kiya
 From June 1963, Kamleshwar edited it
 disambar 63 evam janvari 64 ke 2 ankon ke rup main 'prem katha visheshank'-1 evam 2 kaa prakaashan hua
 The October 1964 editorial was titled 'phantom speaks'
 yah sampadakeey 'akahani' ke viruddh likhaa gaya tha
 Kamleshwar edited 'nayi Kahaniyan' till July 1965
 agast 1965 main namvar singh ke praytn se bhishma saahani ne nayi kahaniyaan kaa sampadan-bhaar sanbhaala or kareeb dhai varsh tak unhone iskaa sampadan kiya
 Rajkamal Prakashan had branches in many cities for a long time, but gradually it only had its own branch in Patna, Bihar and branches of other cities were closed
 vartmaan samay main bhi isaki patna shakha vikray kaa kirtiman sthapit karte hue science college ke saamne, ashok rajpath, patna-6 main vidyaman he
 After separation from Rajkamal publishing group Rajkamal, Omprakash ji founded 'radhakrishna Prakashan'
 unke baad arvind kumaar uske prabandh nideshak hue or unke baad ashok maheshwari ne is daayitv ko sanbhaala
 Later, when Ashok Maheshwari got the responsibility of Rajkamal publication, the sources of these two important publications naturally got interlinked
 isi prakaar ek samay raajakmal kii elahabaad shakha ko band karne kaa nirnay lene par uske taatkaalik prabharee dinesh ji dwaara usee sthaan par sthapit lokbharati prakaashan bhi san 2005 main aapasi samjhaute ke tahat raajakmal se jud gaya or is prakaar 'raajakmal prakaashan samooh' kaa nirmaan hua
 These three publications are also independent in their own right and are related to each other under mutual agreement
 is prakaar hindi sahitya jagat ke sabase bade prakaashan santhaan ke rup main yah samooh gatisheel he
 'BANYAN TREE BOOKS' has also been added to this group
 saath hi isamen raajakmal prakaashan kaa upkram 'sarthak' evam radhakrishna kaa upkram 'funda' bhi shaamil he
 This publication group publishes around four hundred books per year, including a large number of reprintings of previously published books with new publications
 jaanam 1992 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 It was directed by Vikram Bhatt and the lead actors are Rahul Roy and Pooja Bhatt
 isamen anu malik dwaara aalochanatmak or lok-vyapee rup se prashansit soundtrack he or jo unki shuruaati safalataa main se ek he
 Paradise Builders is owned by Dhanraj, who lives a very wealthy lifestyle with his wife Radha
 unka ek betaa, rajan; or ek beti anjali he
 Their goal is to take possession of the nearest village
 vah machuaaron dwaara kabja kar liya gaya he, jiskaa netritv shankar raav karata he, jo apni patni or do beton amar or arun ke saath vahaan rahata he
 Dhanraj's attempt to take possession proved futile
 jab amar or anjali milte hai or ek duusare ke saath pyaar karte hai, shankar or dhanraj donon krodhit hote hai
 While Shankar wants Amar to continue to follow his profession, Dhanraj wants Anjali Gupta to marry Shekhar Gupta, the son of the owner of the company
 baad main dhanraj ne rajan se gaanv main aag lagane ko kaha
 As a result, Rajan and Arun are killed
 dukhagrast dhanraj apane bete kii raakh par kasam khaataa he ki vah kisi bhi keemat par amar kii hatya karke is maut kaa badla legaa
 It has an impact on the Rao family as well as Amar and Anjali
 sabhi anu malik dwaara sangitabaddh

 Voting is a method of making decisions or expressing their views by which a group is able to take a decision after exchange of views and debate
 matdaan kii vyavastha ke dwaara kisi varg yaa samaaj kaa sadsy rajya kii sansad yaa vidhansabha main apana pratinidhi chunane yaa kisi adhikari ke nirvachan main apni ichha yaa kisi prastaav par apana nirnay prakat karata he
 In this view, this system is used in all elections and all parliamentary or direct legislatures
 adhinayakawadi sarkaar main adhinaayak dwaara pehle se liye gaye nirnyon par vyakti ko apana mat prakat karne ke liye kaha ja saktaa he, parantu apane nirnyon ko aropit karne ke adhinaayak ke vibhinn dhang is prakaar ke matdaan ko keval aupchaarik pravidhi tak simit kar dete hai
 In a democratic government itself, voting gets major area and importance
 pracheen bharat main gutikapaat ke atirikt matdaan dwaara bhi adhikariyon ke nirvachan kii vyavastha thi
 In religious institutions, especially in Buddhist associations, certain rules of election were followed
 "chullabagg" main saky dwaara matdaan kii teen pravidhiyon kaa ullekh he : gupt matdaan, kaan main kahkar mat prakat karne kii, pravidhi tathaa khulaa matdaan
 The Buddhist Sanghas used colored wood pellets as a ballot for secret ballot
 shalakaon kaa sangraahak matadaataaon ko rangon ke arth samajhakar unke mat sangrah karata tha or bahumat kaa nirnay maanya hota tha
 Voting system existed in Europe in ancient Greece and Italy
 pracheen rajtantron main yah prachlan tha ki kuch gambhir vishyon par swayan nirnay lene ke purv raja apni praja kii sanmati praapt karne ke liye use aamantrit kare
 The manner of expressing votes in such meetings was oral
 athens main gutikapaat ke atirikt jahaan matdaan kii vyavastha thi vahaan haath uthaakar mat prakat karne kii pratha thi
 But there was a system of secret ballot on subjects affecting the social level of an individual
 rome main idri pudru duusari shatabdi tak matdaan kaa dhang "vibhaajan" kaa tha
 But due to economic and social support of the majority of the voters, the system could not be suitable for independent voting
 at: vidhaan dwaara matparipatr kii vyavastha kii gai jiske liye momranjit kashthalaka prayukt hoti thi
 Various theories have been formulated regarding the importance of modern democracy and its system
 in siddhanton ke falswaroop, aavashyaktaa ke samay sangharsh nivaaran kii saamaajik pravidhi ke rup main; shashan satta ke prati anuvritti praapt karne ke dhang ke rup main; saamaajik sangharsh ke bich saamanjasy sthapit karne ke saadhan ke rup main; thik paristhitiyon main thik nirnay praapt karne kii paddati ke rup main, saamaajik aavashyaktaaon tathaa asantoshon ko anaavriti kii vyavastha ke rup main; tathaa alpsankhyakon ko rajya ke laabhon se vanchit rakhane kii vyavastha se bachaane ke dhang ke rup main, matdaan ko manyata praapt hui he
 Recently, considerable attention has been paid to this problem to the extent to which those who have the franchise suffer to participate in the exercise of this right
 is vishay main kii gai khoj ke anusaar un janatantratmak deshon ke log matdaan main adhiktam sankhya main bhaag lete hai jahaan "anivaary matdaan" kii vyavastha apanaai gai he
 The doctrine of compulsory voting was first introduced in a canton called st
gallen, Switzerland, for which in 1835, it was imposed by the canton by legislation for those who did not take part in the elections of the District Council
 yah vyavastha swiss nagarikon ko matadhikaar ke uttardaayitv kaa anubhav karaane main safal hui he
 Also, as a result of this system, the work of political organizations to bring voters out of the house to get involved in voting has also become lighter
 isi prakaar bavaria ne san 1881 idri main, bulgeria ne san 1882 idri tathaa belgium ne san 1893 idri anivaary matdaan kii vyavastha apanaai
 According to Bavaria's system, if more than one-third of the total number of voters do not participate in voting, then absentee voters will have to bear the entire expenditure of re-election
 belgium ne anupasthit matadaataaon ke liye teen dand nirdhaarit kiye antarvivek par—arth dand, saarvajanik bhartsana tathaa matadhikaar apharan
 It is generally said in opposition to compulsory voting that this system does not leave any room for objectionists, however, the character of those who do not vote is not as important an issue as to what means to get votes
 Is used
 yadi kisi desh main anuchit sadhano dwaara keval vishisht uddeshyon evam swaarthon kii purti ke liye sachesht raajnneetik sanghathan hi matadaataaon ko matdaan main sanmilit hone kii prerana dete hai, tathaa is prakaar apane paksh main unke mat sangrah karte hai to nishchay hi nirvachan tathaa matdaan kaa prabandh sarkaar ke haathon saupana adhik shreyaskar hoga taaki yah kaary adhik uttardaayitv ke saath sampann ho sake
 Utsav is a 1984 Hindi language film
 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavadgita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he

 Just as the British started sentencing the island of Andaman to punish Kalapani, the author has imagined an island named Gulag in this novel
 is upanyaas ke prakaashan ke baad "gulaag" shabd vishwa bhar main mashhoor ho gaya
 Ann Appleboum, who studied the gulag system deeply, states that "in a great sense, 'gulag' has become the Soviet persecution system, the methods that prisoners once called the 'meat grinder': arrests, harsh Inquiries, traveling in vehicles carrying cold animals, forcing hard work, destroying families, years of deportation, death of needless young age etc
