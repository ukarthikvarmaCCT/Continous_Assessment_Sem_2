 Scattered like dots of light at night in the cloudless sky, flickering lights show many stars
 kuch chamakate taron ke samooh akaash ko vibhinn bhaagon main baant dete hai
 The group of these stars is called the constellation
 puure akaash ko 89 taramandalon main vibhakt karke un taramandalon ke naam rakh die gaye hai
 The constellations of the zodiac are very famous, their nouns are Aries, Taurus etc
 kisi ek taramandal ke taron ko unke drishy kantimaan ke avaroh kram main chun liya jaataa he
 Asterisks are then named by placing Greek letters next to the constellation's name, such as the brightest star of the Aries zodiac named after the alphabet
 kuch taramandalon main taron kii sankhya itani adhik he ki greek varnmaala ke aksharon kii sankhya unke liye kam pad jaati he
 For naming such strings, we write the former Latin letters of the constellations and numbers if necessary
 kuch taare atiprakashit hone ke kaaran atiprasiddh hai tathaa unke naam taramandalon ke sandarbh ke bina bhi jane ja sakate hen, jaise lubdhak, magha, chitra aadi
 This type of nomenclature helps to identify strings
 khaali aankhon se dekhne par kuch taare adhik chamkile tathaa kuch kam chamkile dikhaai dete hai
 According to their radiance, we classify the stars into several radians
 taare hamase bahut adhik duuri par sthit hai
 We do not see less bright stars as the distance increases
 bina yantra kii sahaayta ke hamaari ankhen chathe kantimaan tak ke taare dekh sakati hai
 The classification of radians is such that the stars appear brightest, their minimums are considered to be the minimum number of stars, less than that of bright stars, and so on
 kantimaan ke taare kii apeksha use purvavarti kantimaan taare kii chamak athwa 2
512 guna adhik hoti he
 In this way, the star of the first radiance is 2
512 times brighter than the star of the second radius and the star of the second radius is 2
512 times brighter than the star of the third radius
 yadi ham chathe kantimaan ke taare kii chamak 1 maan len, to pratham kantimaan se chathe kantimaan tak ke taron kii chamak 100:39

 mount palomar vedhashala ke 200 inch vyas ke paravarti doordarshee se ham 23 kantimaan tak ke taare dekh sakate hai
 Current measurement means the measurement of the intensity of starlight
 pehle yah kaary vishesh prakaar ke photomeateron kii sahaayta se aankhon dwaara kiya jaataa tha
 The records obtained in this way are called visual records
 ankhen pile prakaash kii sugrahi hai, at: drishyakantimaan pile or hare rang ke prakaash ke maapak hai
 Later the decoction was done with the help of photography plates
 is prakaar se gyaat kaantikan ko photography kantimaan kehete hai
 Photographic currents are measures of blue light
 taare kai rangon ke prakaash vikeern karte hai
 Therefore, the intensity of light is measured by sensitized plates of different colors and by the use of pigments to determine the strength of stars
 pile rang kii sugrahi platon par pile rangashodhakon se photography tathaa drishy kantimanon ke antar ko varna suchak kehete hai
 This determines the temperature of the wires
 kantimaan photograhi selon par prakaash ko grahan kar tathaa use bahugunit kar prakaash kii tivrata maapi jaati he
 While measuring current we also have to keep in mind the effect of the atmosphere and the effect of the interstellar dust and gases of the stars
 kantimaan ke yatharth gyaan se hamen taron kii dooriyaan tathaa bahut se bhautik padaartho ko jaanane main sahaayta milti he
 The personal light of many stars is very high, but due to being stationary at a great distance, their visible record is more visible
 yatharth kantimaan to tabhi gyaat ho saktaa he, jab ve upamaatr se samaan duuri par sthit hon
 All the stars are imagined at a distance of 10 parsecs, and the known value is called absolute value
 yadi hamen taare kaa drishy kantimaan gyaat ho tathaa uski duuri gyaat ho to ham nimnlikhit sutara se nirpeksh kantimaan jaan sakate hai: 5– 5 logarithmic distances are in the parsecs
 vilomat: yadi hamen nirpeksh kantimaan gyaat ho to ham taron kii dooriyaan bhi jaan sakate hai
 The absolute record of the Sun is 4
7
 kisi taare kii surya ke saapeksh kanti ko saapeksh kanti kehete hai
 In this, the radian of the Sun is assumed to be 1
 is prakaar ke adhyayan se ham taron se praapt honevaali urja kaa adhyayan karte hai, jisase unki bhautik sthitiyon ke adhyayan main sahaayta milti he
 No 8 no purnataya nirmal akaash main hamen drushti sahaayak yantron ke 3,200 se adhik taare nahin dikhalaai padate
 Since we are able to see only half of the sky, the number of microscopic stars is about 6,500
 inamen 20 stars brighter than 1,5 radiance 2 kantimaan tak chamkile 50 taare hai 150 stars up to 3 radiant 4 kantimaan tak chamkile 500 taare hai Tara has 5 bright stars up to 5 radiant shesh chakshudrishy taare chathe kantimaan ke he
 If we make our vision 10 times inward, then the number of visible stars will increase by 1000 times, that is, if the stars are assumed to be spread evenly, then their number will increase by six times their distance
 yah sambandh adhik chamkile taron tak hi simit he
 The number of stars known by the largest telescope in a lesser galaxy is about 1, xxwrep 2 00, 000
 taare kii vaastavik gati tathaa gamandisha gyaat karne ke liye ham uski gati ko do bhaagon main baant lete hai
 The angular value of the motion of the perpendicular direction on the sight is called the private motion of the star
 taron kii nijee gatiyaan kam hotin hai
 In order to find them we have to compare the photographs of stars taken in very distant times
 jo taare hamaare nikat hai, ve doorvarti taron ke saapeksh aage peeche hat jate hai
 By dividing this angular value by the interval of time, the individual speeds become known
 is koniya drushtisutra kii disha kii tarak gati ko traigy veg kehete hai
 To find the radial velocity, we take the spectrum of stars with the help of spectroscopy
 yadi varnakram rekhaayen nile chor kii taraf hati hon, to ham dopalar sidwant kii sahaayta se jaan lete hai ki tara hamaari ore aa rahaa he tathaa, yadi varnakram rekhaayen laal chor kii ore hati hon, to ham se dur ja rahaa he
 The transfer of lines is inversely proportional to their triangulation
 banard ne ophiukas taramandal ke ek dashm kantiman ke taare kii nijee gati 10
3 prati varsh gyaat kii he, jo vishaltam he
 Knowledge of private motion is helpful in the study of the stars and from this we also know that the stars of more blue motion are relatively closer to us
 traigy veg kaa surya ke saapeksh gyaan karne ke liye, hamen prithvi kii gati ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana padataa he
 The knowledge of private motion and radial velocity makes the actual speed and its direction known by the principle of force-parallel-quadrilateral
 taron kii dooriyaan gyaat karne ke liye trikoshmetiya vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The star closest to us is also at such a distance that if we consider the diameter of the Earth as its base, then they seem to be parallel, that is, the parallax of the star is zero
 at: taron ke lamban ko gyaat karne ke liye hamen bade aadhaar kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Therefore, we base the diameter of the Earth's orbit
 yadi ham kisi taare kii disha ke ek vedh ke chha: maheene baad uskaa vegh karen to hamen prithvi kii kaksha ke vyas kaa aadhaar mil jaataa he
 With this type of perforation, the nearest stars show slight changes relative to the distant stars
 ise nikaalte samay hamen taare kii nijee gati ke prabhaav par bhi vichaar karnaa padataa he
 Even then it is so low that the parallax of the nearest star is 76
 yadi kisi taare kaa lamban 1 ho to vah prithvi se prithvi kii kaksha kii trigya se 2,06,265 guni duuri par hota he
 This distance is called a parsec
 duuri maapne ke liye jis anya ikai kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, vah he prakashavarsh 
 The velocity of light is 1,86,000 miles per second
 is veg se prakaash ek varsh main jitani duuri tak jaataa he utani duuri ko ek prakaash varsh kehete hai yah duuri lagbhag 60, xxwrep 2 00, 000 mile hoti he
 a parsec is about 3
26 light years
 trikoshmetiya vidhi se ham keval atyant samipsth taron kii dooriyaan hi gyaat kar sakate hai
 Therefore, to find the distances of distant stars, we have to take shelter of other methods
 yadi ham kisi prakaar taron ke nirpeksh kantimaan ko jaan saken, to ham nirpeksh kantimaan sheershak main die gaye sutara kii sahaayta se unki dooriyaan gyaat kar sakate hai
 Fortunately, we have stars of Cefide and Lyra, whose absolute values we can find
 taron ke lambnon ko gyaat karne kii nimnlikhit anya vidhiyaan hai: These classifications have personal significance and they give us special help in the analysis of stars
 in vargikarnon kaa sankshipt parichay nimnlikhit he: The Sun is our nearest star, which we can study very well
 taron ke tatwon ke adhyayan se hamen adhikansh taare aise uplabdh hote he, jinka janm lagbhag usee samay hua jis samay hamaare surya kaa
 These stars are in descending sequence of temperature, shape and radiance
 is varg ko mukhya anukram kehete hai
 In this, the size of the stars of extreme heat will be about 10 times the size of the Sun and the size of the stars of the lower temperature will be about 10 times the size of the Sun and the size of the stars of the lower temperature will be about the tithe of the Sun
 surya isi anukram kaa ek majhole aakaar kaa tara he, jisaki dravyamatra tathaa taap ausat se kam he
 Upward stars in the curve of the main sequence are extremely rare
 is anukram ke adhikansh taare surya se chote tathaa kam taap ke hai
 The amount of elements available in them is like the Sun
 surya ke adhyayan se ham is varg ke atirikt taron ke do or mukhya varg he: daanavaakar taron ke teen mukhya bhed hai
 Dancing, and leftward stars
 daanavaakar taron ke teen mukhya bhed - daanavkaar, ati daanavaakar tathaa upadanavaakar 
 Extravagant stars are very large in size
 udaahranarth, jyeshtha kaa vyas surya ke vyas kaa lagbhag 300 guna he
 In celestial stars, the diameter of the second beta pigassi of the Khagashv is 170 times the diameter of the Sun and that of the Brahmin is 12 times the diameter of the Sun
 upadanavaakar taare mukhya anukram tathaa daanav varg ke taara ke bich sthit hai
 Left-wing stars also have Vamana, Upavaman, Lalrang Vamana and white-vamana distinction
 in virgon main shwet vamanakaar taare apana vishesh mahatv rakhte hai
 Their specialty is that their mass volume is mid-range and less radiant, but their size is very small and their density is extremely high
 hamen jitne taare dikhaai dete hai, unamem atyadhik maatra main ve taare hai, jo hamaari gallexi ke sadsy hai
 Our Galaxy is a world in itself
 iskaa aakaar sarpil he
 There are many other celestials, which have a spiral shape
 unki rachana tathaa akruti kaa adhyayan karne ke liye hamen apni akashganga ke kuch vishesh prakaar ke taron ke adhyayan se sahaayta milti he
 There are mainly two classes of these stars
 kuch taare sadaa gallexi kii sarpil bhujaaon main uplabdh hote hai tathaa anya gallexi ke nabhik ke nikat paae jate hai
 Among them, the stars of the first class are immediate neighbors of our Sun and the stars of the second class are away from the Sun
 walter wade ne pratham varg ke taron kaa naam pratham tara shrenee, athwa population pratham, tathaa duusare varg ke taron kaa naam dwitiya tara shrenee, athwa population dwitiya rakhaa he
 Both of these types of Taravargo vary in spectral-radius-curves
 pratham tarashrenee ke atyant chamkile taare nile rang ke hote hai tathaa unka nirpeksh kantimaan 7 athwa 8 hota he, jabaki dwitiya tarashrenee ke atyant chamkile taare laal rang ke hote hai tathaa unka nirpeksh kantimaan - 3 yaa usase adhik hota he
 In the stars of the first star, there is an excessive amount of interstellar gas and dust, while in the stars of the second star it is very small
 in tarashreniyon ke adhyayan se hame gallexion kii sarpil bhujaaon tathaa nabhikon ko nishchit karne maatr ke hi liye nahin, kintu inase hamen taron kii utpatti tathaa vikaas kii sthiti kaa adhyayan karne main bhi sahaayta milti he
 Molecules of the mass of stars, which remain neutral in the atmosphere, become ionized due to the progressive increase in temperature and they lose more and more of their negative electrons
 iske prabhaav se aise taron ke varnakram main bananevaali chamakili or kaali rekhaon main vibhinnata aa jaati he
 In other words, the lines represent the different states of heat of the molecules that radiate the light of stars
 is prakaar taron ke varnakramon ke adhyayan se unke mukhya 10 bhed kiye gaye hai, jinhen roman lipi ke bade aksharon o, bi, e, epa, ji, ke, em, aar, en, tathaa es se vyakt karte hai
 Since alphabetical classification is related to temperature, the smaller alphabet a to e of the English alphabet is placed after o for strings of o spectrum and O, to show successive degradation of the temperature of the same class of stars
 Oba etc
 isi prakaar ke abhipraay ko vyakt karne ke liye bi se em ke varnakram ke taron ke liye unke suchak aksharon ke baad 0 se lekar 9 tak ke ank rakhe jate hai
 These are ionized helium stars
 inke varnakramon main ynikrut helium tathaa dohare tihare ynikrut oxigen tathaa nitrogen kii rekhaayen praapt hotin hai
 According to this ionized state, its surface temperature should be from 30, xxrep 4 0 to 40, xxrep 4 0 c or more
 o varnakram ke gyaat taron kii sankhya sau se adhik nahin he, jinamein adhikash nangi aankhon se nahin dekhe ja sakate
 The three stars of this class, Gama Beloram Oy, Zeta Pappis Oy and Zitaorayan, are Oi5 Chakshu Darshan
 ye udasin helium vaale taare hai
 Their surface temperature ranges from 25,000 ° to 12,000 ° C
 yah taap yadhyapi helium ko ynikrut karne main asamarth he, tathaapi iske varnakram main ynikrut oxigen rekhaayen uplabdh hotin hai
 Helium and ionized oxygen lines begin to decrease in stars from the B5 star to the lower heat, and hydrogen lines and broad black absorption lines of hydrogen emerge
 hamaari tarasuchiyon main bi taare bahut hai
 These are the major stars of hydrogen

 Earlier they were known as Suryakalanka stars
 titonium oride taare
 Their surface heat ranges from 3,500 ° to 2,000 ° C
 inamen praaia: sabhi chal taare hai, jinamein keval chakshudrishy koi nahin he
 Their surface heat ranges from 3,000 ° to 5,000 ° N
 ye sabhi daanavaakar tathaa adhikanshat: chal taare hai
 These are very few in number
 inamen se koi bhi tara keval chakshu se saraltapurvak drishy nahin he
 There are some stars whose radiance keeps decreasing
 inhen chal taare kehete hai
 In order to give clear instructions of movable stars, big letters of English alphabet R, S, t etc
 are placed in front of the constellation, like r SETI etc
 inaki sankhya badhane ke saath ek akshar ke sthaan par do athwa teen akshar bhi rakhane pad sakate hai, yatha aar aar lira aadi
 About 20,000 movable stars are known and they are weighed regularly

 Some of these stars have a rotation period of less than a day
 aise taare aar aar lira varg ke hai
 The rotation period of some is from 1 to 50 days
 aise taare sefiid varg ke taare hai
 The rotation period of some stars ranges from 100 to 1000 days
 inhen dirdh aavartkaalik taare kehete hai
 The stars of this class are red colored stars
 kuch taare ardhniyamit chal hai, inkaa chakra 40 se lekar 150 din tak kaa he
 These stars are also red colored stars
 inamen aar aar lira tathaa sefiid taare atyant mahatvapurn hai
 r Lyra stars got its name because all of these properties are similar to the moving star described in Lyra Planetarium, which was named RR Lyra
 naam se yah na samajhnaa chahie ki aise taare keval lira taramandal main hi hote hai, kintu is shrenee ke taare hamaari gallexi tathaa anya tarapranaliyon aadi main sarvatra hai
 The reason for the importance of these stars is their distancing
 aar aar lira varg ke taron main aavartankaal ke badhane par par bhi unke nirpeksh kantimaan main antar nahin padataa
 This means that if one of the galaxial stars has RR Lyra stars, they will be of the same absolute radius and it is almost equal to zero of the same absolute radius
 aisi avasthaa main unke drishy kantimaan ke gyaan se unki duuri nimnlikhit sutara dwaara gyaat ho sakati he
 Absolute radius = visual radius + 5 - 5 logarithmic distance inkaa yah naam isliye padaa ki inaki prakruti delta sefius, athwa chartuth kapish, kii tarah kii he
 The fourth Auburn is the brightest star in the Cepheid category, which can be seen from the eye
 sefiod taron kaa aavartankaal ek din se kuch adhik se lekar 45 din se kuch adhik he
 Our galaxy's cepheid stars often have a 7-day rotation period
 sefiid taron kii sabase badi visheshta he inkaa aavartankaal-kanti-saahchary niyam se sangat hona
 This means that as the growth period of the cepheid wires increases, their absolute value increases
 yah sambandh atyant mahatvapurn he
 With its help, the distance can be determined by the previous formula by knowing the absolute value of the safe stars
 sefiid taron kii sahaayta se taragucchon tathaa tarapaddatiyon kii duuri gyaat kii jaati hai
 The reason for the change of thermogenic color is generally assumed to be the flutter principle, which means that the rotation of the surface of the cepheid wires causes growth and depletion, causing the star to expand and shrink sequentially
 vastut: spandan siddhant sabhi sthitiyon kaa yatharth uttar nahin detaa
 Therefore, nowadays astrologers are beginning to understand that the different positions of cefoid stars are due to the change of their temperature, which itself is an iterative cycle
 1,000 se adhik sefiid taare gyaat he
 Such wires explode regularly or irregularly
 ye taare saamanyat: atyant dhundle hote hai, kintu visphot hone ke baad inaki kanti atyant asaadhaaran rup se bad jaati he
 After this situation lasts for a few days, the stars fall into their normal radius
 is prakaar ke taron ko navtara kehete hai
 In 1918, the glow of the Navatar of Aquila Tarapunja had increased by forty thousand times within four days
 anya prasiddh navtare hai: parasyus taramandal kaa navtara, 1925 i0 victoris navtara tathaa 1934 i0 kaa harkulis taramandal kaa navtara
 Those who become very exceptionally bright after the Navatarite explosion are called Atinavatara
 1885 i0 ke andromida niharika ke atinavtaare ne chah dinon main itnaa adhik prakaash vikeern kiya ki surya kadachit utane prakaash ko 10 lakh varsho main vikeern kar paaegaa
 Other types of moving stars are often of irregular rotation
 kisi svachh raatri main akaash main kuch dhundle prakaash ke dhabbe se dikhaai dete hai
 If we look at them with powerful instruments, then there are three types of things found in them: star flakes, nebulae and galaxies
 niharikas chamakili gaison se bani hai tathaa aakashgangaayen hamaari gallexi kii tarah swatantra tarapranaliyaan hai
 There are two types of star flakes, one that is available in the sky-like plane, or near the celestial spiral arms
 aise guchchhe akashgangeey guchchhe kehalaate hai
 The number of stars in these is relatively less
 is prakaar ke varg main krittika tara guchchhe atyadhik chamkila tathaa bada he
 The globular globules lie away from the spiral arms and near the nucleus
 golakaar taragucchon main apekshaakrit atyaadhik taare rahete hai
 They are often seen with a twist
 inhen doordarshiyon se hi dekha jaataa he
 The Ombanga Sentari and 47 Tukane Panchal Kantiman, Chakshudhishyas, are related to the population of the spherical galaxy
 avashya hi inase taron ke vikaas kii avasthaaon kaa gyaan hota he
 The distance of the cluster is determined with the help of the RR Lyra and cepheid wires present in these wires
 inke adhyayan se gallexi ke swaroop ke adhyayan main bahut sahaayta milti he
 Most stars are double, or majority, they do not have anything interconnected in pairs of stars, but they appear very close because they are located towards our line of sight
 aise taron ko chakshush, dohare taare kehete hai
 Such stars are few
 adhikansh taare vastut: ek yaa adhik taron ke saath hai
 Two stars, which travel in a certain type of longitudinal path with mutual attraction, are called star-pairs
 yah nishchay ho jane par ki koi tara vastut: yugma hai, ham uske sambandh kii bahut si baaten gyaat kar sakate hai, kyonki uski, athwa uske saathi tara kii, gati vyapak gurutvkarshan niyam kaa paalan karti hai
 The speed and mass of the pair wires can be determined with certainty
 yugmatare mukhyatya teen prakaar ke hote hai: drishy, grahauakari tathaa varnakrameey 
 To know the class of visual pair, one has to weigh their distance and angle of view
 adhikansh drishy yugmataron kaa parikramankal bahut lanbaa hota he, jise gyaat karne ke liye saikadon varshon tak vegh kii aavashyaktaa he
 Therefore, although more than 25,000 visual pairings have been known, the knowledge of more than 200 orbits is not yet known
 grahauakari yugmatare ke sahchar kii kaksha praaia: hamaari drushtirekha kii disha main thode se jhukaav se rahati he, jisase ek tara duusare ko purnataya yaa khandash: dhak letaa he or isse ek taare kaa prakaash hamen dikhaai nahin padataa
 This allows the pair to be identified, because in normal conditions, the amount of light that this star has remains at the time of eclipse decreases
 yah grahan kii sthiti niyat samay se hotin hai
 In such strings, the Beta percussion, that is, Algool, is very famous
 saamaanya avasthaa main iskaa kantimaan 2
2 hota he, ja grahan ke samay 3
4 rah jaataa he
 After the eclipse, its record becomes 2
2 again
 kuch yugmataron ke sahchar kii kaksha kaa samtal prithvi ke sameep se nahin jaataa, at: ham uske grahan kii sthiti nahin dekh sakate hai
 But by changing the lines of its spectrum, we get to know that this star sometimes comes towards us and sometimes goes away from us, so that it is clear that it is flying around an invisible star
 aise taare varnakrameey yugmataron kaa parikraman kaal kam hota he
 Classes of about 309 spectral stars have been known
 taron ke aakaar praaia: teen vidhiyon se jane jate hai: From absolute temperature and temperature, grahauakari yugmataron ke grahankaal se tathaa By interferometer
 pratham vidhi plank ke nimnlikhit sutara par aadhaarit he: View Absolute Record Mvis = - 5 log - 0
08 jahaan r = taare kii trigya he
 The radius relative to its orbit becomes known by the time of eclipse of the eclipse star
 vyatikaranmaapi se taare kaa koniya vyas gyaat ho jaataa he tathaa isaki duuri gyaat hone se iskaa saral rekhaatmak vyas bhi gyaat ho jaataa he
 On the basis of the diameter of the stars, their names are donated and left
 taron kii dravyamatra gyaat karne kii pratyaksh vidhi yugma taron ke sahachaar kii gati kaa adhyayan karne se praapt hotin hai
 The mass quantities of these stars are determined with the help of the law of gravitation
 kisi bhi vaaman taare kii dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra ke dashamansh se kam nahin uplabdh hui hai, tathaa surya se 10 guni se adhik dravyamatra ke taare bhi viral hi hai
 Density of a star = mass / volume
 is prakaar dekhne se pataa chalata he ki daanavaakar taron kaa ghanatv atyant kam hota he tathaa vamanakaar taron kaa atyadhik
 The diameter of a giant star like Jyeshta is 480 times the diameter of the Sun, even if its mass is no more than 20 times the mass of the Sun
 parinamat: iskaa ghanatv surya ke ghanatv ke 
 xxrep 7 0 2 se bhi kam he
 It is also much lower than the density of ordinary air
 shwetavaman taare sirium bi kaa, jisaki trigya surya kii trigya kii 
034 tathaa dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra kii 86 he, ghanatv itnaa adhik he ki uske dravya ke ek ghan inch kaa bhaar ek ton hoga
 Normally with the help of a photometer, by comparing the density of different colors of starlight with the density of colors already known in the laboratory, the surface temperature of stars can be determined
 kintu iske nishchit rup se gyaat karne kii sarvottam vidhi he, unke prakaash kaa varnakrameey vishleshan
 On the basis of this, there is a spectral classification of stars, which literally signifies their temperature
 taare apni urja nabhikeey abhikriya se praapt karte hai
 Due to the heating of the star's nucleus, the hydrogen atoms of the stars are converted from the nucleus to the atoms of helium
 iske parinaam swaroop taron main atyadhik taap kii utpatti hotin hai, jise ye prakaash ke rup main vikeern karte rahete hai
 They have to lose very little power to generate a lot of energy
 atev inaki dravyamatra main koi baari kami nahin hoti tathaa inkaa jivan bhi karodon varshon kaa ho jaataa he
 The atmosphere of stars is also studied by the lines of the spectrum
 surya ke vayumandal ke adhyayan se hamen pataa chalaa he ki isamen hydrogen atyadhik maatra main hai
 The second place is of helium
 anya tatv kam maatra main hai, tathaapi magnesium or oxigen ke parmaanu nishchit rup se vidyaman hai
 Of the known chemical elements, 61 elements have been identified in the Sun's atmosphere
 adhikashan taron kaa vayumandal surya sareekha he, tathaapi sabhi taron kaa vayumandal bilkul ek sa nahin he
 There is a difference between the amounts of carbon and oxygen in them
 taron ke mul tatwon ko unke varnakram kii rekhaon ke adhyayan se janaa jaataa he
 In the laboratory, the spectrums of the different basic elements are taken, and by matching them to the spectrum of the stars, the basic elements available in the stars are identified
 is prakaar ke adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki ausat taron main lagbhag 70 heidrogen, 28 helium, 1
5 carbon, nitrogen, oxigen tathaa niann or 0
5 loh varg ke tathaa anya baari tatv hote hai
 The heavy element population first wires have about 3 and the population second ones have less than 1
 taron kaa janm taron ke antarvarti gas tathaa dhul ke kanon se hota he
 The electrophoresis of gas clouds usually remain in a neutral state, but when a very hot star moves near them, they ionize and move and form a nucleus, attracting the masses of gas and dust around them
 Starts wearing huge forms
 gati tathaa sankochan se nabhik kaa taap badhane par, inamen nabhikeey abhikriya prarambh ho jaati he, jisase ye prakaash urja ko vikeern karne lagate tathaa hamen nae taron ke swaroop main dikhalaai dene lagate hai
 Studies of the energy radiations of various types of stars have shown that the stars of Population II are very ancient and the stars of Population i are relatively later
 taron ke jivan se taatpary unke prakashmay jivan se hota he
 The basis of the light of stars is their reserves of hydrogen, from which they receive heat energy by nuclear reaction
 jo taare atyadhik chamkile hai, swabhaavat: ve apane hydrogen ke bhandar kaa adhikadhik upbhog karke use adhik shighrata se helium main parivartit karte rahete hai
 Although stars can regain their heat energy for many years by shrinking their hydrogen reserves, their main basis of life depends on their hydrogen intake
 jo taare atyadhik chamkile dikhalaai dete hai, unka jeevankaal 109 varsh ke lagbhag tathaa mukhya anukram ke dhundle taaro kaa jeevankaal 1013 varsh ke lagbhag hota he
 The life of the Sun is about 1010 years
 apane chaaron ore faile hue taramay vishwa ke rahasy ko jaanane kii hamaari ichha bahut puraani he
 By studying the stars, we have found the world to be full of many galaxies like the Galaxy
 laal rang kii ore rekhaon ke sthanrann dwaara hamane taron ke varnakramon ke adhyayan se itnaa jaan liya he ki hamaara vishwa fail rahaa he
 However, due to our limited means, we have not been able to know the true form of the world
 hamaare vishwa kaa kitna vistaar he failata hua vishwa kis seemaa tak fail saktaa he vishwa kii vakrata kisi he, tathaa vakrata trigya kya he ye sabhi prashan abhi tak vivaadaaspad hai tathaa in vishyon main hamaara koi nishchit sarvasammat siddhant nahin he
 The largest mount Palomar Veghshala, a 200-inch-diameter Hale telescope reached one billion parsecs, or about 20, xxwrep 2 00, 00 miles, only for a distance of view Have got
 uske aage kya he, ham nahin jaan sake
 Therefore, our attention has now reached almost the limit of the radio telescope
 at: ab hamaara dhyaan radio doordarshiyon kii ore gaya he
 In the current progress of scientific development, we hope that the radio visionaries will be able to take us to the unknown mysteries of the world
 vaigyanik tathyon ke baavjood yah akashiya drishy anadikaal se vishwavyaapee vishwaason main mahatvapurn rahaa he
 The Puranichas, ancient mythological and semi-historical chronicles and folklore reveal the prevailing beliefs about this phenomenon
 akaash kii is vilakshan ghatana kaa sabase adhik sambandh bhavishyasuchak vishwasaparampara se aabaddh falit jyotish se he jisamen iske falafal kaa vidhaan kiya jaataa he
 Varahamihira's Brihatsamhita states that those people who pay the fruits of their entire deeds in heaven fall as meteors
 bhavishyavaanee sambandhi vishwaason ke anusaar ulkapaat kahin shubhasuchak he or kahin ashubhasuchak
 But most of the time it is considered ominous as a divine sign of any future accident
 plini ke ullekhanusaar 1200 i0 pus0 ke pracheen greece ke nagarrajya sparta ke rajaniyantrak dandadhikari yadi aath varsh kii shasnavadhi ke baad, kisi chandraviheen svachh raatri main ulkapaat hote dekh lete the to shaasha ke papatma hone kaa daivi sanket maanakar use gaddi se utaar dete the
 With regard to constellations and stars, this singular superstition is generally prevalent in a wide area of asia, Europe, America and Africa that each star of the sky governs the life and fate of different humans or humans on the earth
 nakshatron ke rup, swabhaav, sthaan tathaa gati kii kalpana ke aadhaar par janmapatri main vyakti ke bhavi jivan kii vyakhya kaa aadhaar yahi vishwaas he jise ek ganitiya yaa vaigyanik paddati pradaan kii gai he
 Their relation to fate can be easily discovered in the meanings of the words 'tara' and 'nakshatra' prevalent in the expression of the said terrain
 isi prakaar kisi taare kaa rang or tej bhi prithvi ke kisi manushya ke swabhaav or bhagyaka pratinidhitiv karata he; saath hi, uske tuutane kaa arth he sambandhit vyakti kaa mrit hona
 According to the legend of the Pune castes, when all the stars are broken, then the human creation will end
 kahin kahin iskaa arth nae janm kaa sanket bhi he kintu tarapaat kii yah shubhasthiti vishwaas jagat main atyant viral he
 Mathematical notation is a symbol or symbol used to express a mathematical verb or relation, to denote the nature or quality of a mathematical sign, or to specify a phrase, a specific number, or a mathematical amount often used in arithmetic
 Huh
 is prakaar a + ba main dhan kaa chinh nirdisht karata he ki a main ba jodna he; a < ba main asamta kaa chinh a kaa ba se chota hone kaa sambandh darshata he; pha main, sanket yah suchit karata he ki falan pha ekarup vardhaman falan he
 Mathematical reasoning can be written briefly with the help of mathematical notation and thus it is helpful in mathematical thinking
 pathak sookshm or tarksangat bhashaa kii sahaayta se jatil sambandhon ko saralata se samaj saktaa he
 The lack of adequate development of notation in the medieval centuries had stunted the progress of mathematics
 16 veen shatabdi ke ant main praarambhik bijganit kaa shuddh sankethik rup main vikaas hone ke pashchaat hi 17veen shatabdi main ganit kii kuch vishisht shakhaon kii unnati ho saki
 In ancient handwritten texts, various signs and syntheses are found, but all of them changed over time and they came into the present form after many adaptations
 vyaavhaarik sanketan kii unnati bahut dhire-dhire hui or ve hi sanket prayukt hote rah sake jo sankshipt the, ganitiya siddhanton ke prayoganukool paae gaye or saralata se mudrit kiye ja sake
 Sometimes the long-term circulation of a signal has also led to its adoption, although a more useful signal has been propagated in its place, such as the Karani Sachinh, which is still used despite the more flexible fractional exponent: praarambhik bijganit ke dhan tathaa rin chinh sabase purv san 1489 main mudrit hue the or gunan tathaa bhaag ke chinh sabase pehle kramash: san 1631 or 1659 main prakashit hue the

 Barmil's grandfather, Narayan Lal's ancestral village was Barabai
 yah gaanv tatkaaleen gwalior rajya main chambal nadi ke bihadon ke bich sthit tomarsghar kshetra ke muraina jile main tha or vartmaan main yah madhya pradesh main he
 The residents of Barabai village used to harass the villagers with British and English hegemony
 paariwarik kalah ke kaaran narayan laal ne apni patni vichitra devi evam donon putron - muralidhar va kalyanmal sahit apana paitruk gaanv chhod diya
 After leaving his village, only two of his brothers - Aman Singh and Saman Singh - remained in Barabai, whose descendants still live in the same village
 aaj barbai gaanv ke ek park main madhya pradesh sarkaar dwaara ram prasad bismil kii ek pratimaa sthapit kar di gayi he
 At the same time, 'barabai' village is also being developed under 'sansad Adarsh gram Yojana'

 Later, this family moved to Shahjahanpur, the historical city of Uttar Pradesh
 shahjahanpur main munnuganj ke phatak ke paas sthit ek attaar kii dukaan par maatr teen rupee masik main narayan laal ne naukari kar lee
 His family did not have the support of so little money
 bismil kii daadi vichitra devi ne apane pati kaa haath bataane ke liye anaaj pisane kaa kaary shuru kar diya
 This sequence continued for about two-three years
 unke aachaar-vichaar, tyanishtha va dharmik pravriti se sthaneey log praayah unhen "pandit ji" kahkar sambodhit karte the
 He also had a benefit from this that on every Teej - festival, donations - Dakshina and food etc
 would come to the house
 isi bich narayan laal ko sthaneey nivaasiyon kii sahaayta se ek paathshaala main saat rupee masik par naukari mil gayi
 After some time he also quit this job and started the business of selling Regari
 isse unhen pratidin paanch-saat aane kii aay hone lagi
 Narayan Lal also bought a house to live in Khirnibagh locality of the city and married the eldest son Muralidhar to a daughter of his in-laws' family, Mudmati, and brought him to this new house

 Born on 11 June 1897 in Khirnibagh locality of Shahjahanpur city in Uttar Pradesh, Ramprasad was the second child of his father Muralidhar and mother Moolmati
 unase purv ek putr paidaa hote hi mar chukaa tha
 Seeing the traces of the cycle in the child's horoscope and the two fingers of both hands, an astrologer predicted - "if the child's life is somehow saved, although the chances are very low, then it will be possible to make any person in the world Strength will not stop

 Later, two daughters and two sons also died
 balykaal se hi ramprasad kii shiksha par vishesh dhyaan diya jane laga
 His mind was more in play but less in reading
 iske kaaran unke pitaaji to uski khub pitai lagaate parantu maan hameshaa pyaar se yahi samajhaati ki "betaa ram! ye bahut buree baat he mat kiya karo
 "this loving learning must have had some effect on his mind
 uske pita ne pehle hindi kaa akshar-bodh karaayaa kintu u se ullu na to unhone padhanaa siikhaa or na hi likhakar dikhaaya
 In those days only the owl was taught in Hindi alphabet
 is baat kaa vah virodh karte the or badale main pita kii maar bhi khate the
 Defeated, he was admitted to the Urdu school
 shaayad yahi prakritik gun ramprasad ko ek krantikari bana paye
 At the age of 14, Ramprasad got addicted to stealing money from his father's ark
 churaaye gayi rupayon se unhone upanyaas aadi kharidkar padhanaa prarambh kar diya evam cigarette pine va bhang chadhaane kii aadat bhi pad gayi thi
 Overall, the trend of money-theft continued and Ramprasad was now used to reading books of novels and ghazals filled with Urdu premiers
 sanyog se ek din bhang ke nashe main hone ke kaaran ramprasad ko chori karte hue pakad liya gaya
 Plenty of beating, novels and other books were torn but the habit of stealing money was not lost

 The priest was a settled scholar
 unke vyaktitv kaa prabhaav ramprasad ke jivan par bhi padaa
 Due to the teachings of the priest, Ramprasad began to practice celibacy with the recitation
 pujari kii dekha-dekhi ramprasad ne vyaayaam karnaa bhi prarambh kar diya
 All the misgivings and bad habits of adolescence were in mind
 keval cigarette pine kii lat nahin chhuti
 But she too, after a few days, escaped from the discord of Sushil Chandra Sen, a schoolmate
 cigarette chhootane ke baad ramprasad kaa man padhai main lagane laga
 Very soon he entered the fifth record of English
 ramprasad main apratyaashit parivartan ho chukaa tha
 The body had become handsome and robust
 niyamit puja-paath main samay vyateet hone laga tha
 During this time he got in touch with Munshi Indrajit who came to the temple
 munshi indrajit ne ramprasad ko arya samaaj ke sambandh main bataaya or swami dayanand saraswati kii likhi pustak satyarth prakaash padhane ko di
 The serious study of Satyarth Prakash had a surprising impact on Ramprasad's life
 ramprasad jab government skool shahjahanpur main aathvin kaksha ke chaatr the tabhi sanyog se swami somdev kaa arya samaaj bhawan main aagaman hua
 Munshi Indrajit appointed Ramprasad to Swamiji's service
 yaheen se unke jivan kii dasha or disha donon main parivartan prarambh hua
 a serious study of Satyarth Prakash on the one hand and an open discussion on political subjects with Swami Somdev on the other hand aroused the feeling of patriotism in his mind

 This book was published in 1916 in Kurmi Press, Lucknow under the management of Babu Ganeshprasad
 ramprasad ne yah pustak apni mataji se do baar main do-do sau rupee lekar prakashit kii thi
 He has mentioned this in his autobiography
 yah pustak chhapate hi jabt kar lee gayi thi baad main jab kakori kand kaa abhiyog chalaa to sakshya ke rup main yahi pustak prastut kii gayi thi
 Now this book has been edited and compiled in part-three of Sarfaroshi's book titled Tamanna and can be seen in many other libraries including Teen Murti Bhawan Library, New Delhi

 He formed an organization under the guidance of Pandit Gandalal Dixit under the name Matriwadi
 is sanghathan kii ore se ek ishtihaar or ek pratigya bhi prakashit kii gayi
 In order to collect funds for the party, Ramprasad, who had become famous as 'bismil' till now, also committed two robberies in June 1918 and one in September 1918, making the police alert of these youths
 There were raids all over the place in search
 26 se 31 disambar 1918 tak dilli main laal kile ke saamne hue congress adhiveshan main is sanghathan ke navayuvakon ne chilla-chilla kar jaise hi pustaken bechnaa shuru kiya ki police ne chapa daalaa kintu bismil kii sujh boojh se sabhi pustaken batch gayin

 Among those who were decorated, except for Mukundilal, in February 1920, the general amnesty was released
 bismil puure 2 varsh bhumigat rahe
 Some of his teammates went to Shahjahanpur and spread the rumor that Bhai Ramprasad was killed by a police bullet while the truth was that he jumped in the Yamuna during the police encounter and floated miles inside the water with the power of yoga practice
 Going far ahead, came out of the river and where the Greater Noida is inhabited nowadays, the uninhabited people went to the ravines
 vahaan un dinon keval babul ke hi vriksh hua karte the; or oosar jameen main aadmi to kahin dur-dur tak dikhataa hi nahin tha
 Ram Prasad Bismil took refuge in Rampur Jagir, a small village here and roamed in the uninhabited forests for several months, grazing the cow buffalo of the village goose
 iskaa bada hi rochak varnan unhone apni aatmakatha ke dwitiya khand : swadesh prem main kiya he
 While living here, he wrote his revolutionary novel, The Action of the Bolsheviks

 At present, since this village comes under the Beta Forest Sector of Greater Noida, the Government of Uttar Pradesh has developed the immortal Shaheed Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan in the memory of the Forest Department's reserved land in the area of rampur Jagir village
 Which is supervised by the Forest Department of the state with the funding of Greater Noida Administration
 'bismil' kii ek visheshta yah bhi thi ki ve kisi bhi sthaan par adhik dinon tak thaharte nahin the
 Staying at Rampur Jagir for a few days, he also stayed in Kosma District Mainpuri, the village of his real sister Shastri Devi

 He introduced him to some publishers in Calcutta, including one Ummadatta Sharma, who later published a book titled Catharine by Ram Prasad Bismil in 1922
 san 1921 ke ahmedabad congress adhiveshan main ramprasad'bismil' ne purna swaraj ke prastaav par moulana hasarat mohani kaa khulkar samarthan kiya or antatogatva gandhi ji se asahyog aandolan prarambh karne kaa prastaav paarit karvaa kar hi maane
 Due to this he became very popular among the youth
 samooche desh main asahyog aandolan shuru karne main shahjahanpur ke swayamsevakon kii aham bhoomika thi
 But when Gandhiji withdrew the non-cooperation movement after consulting Chauri Chaura in 1922, in the Congress of 1922, Bismil and his colleagues opposed Gandhiji in such a way that two ideologies were formed in the Congress again - a liberal or Liberals and Second Rebel or Rebellion
 gandhi ji vidrohi vichaardhaara ke navayuvakon ko congress kii aam sabhaaon main virodh karne ke kaaran hameshaa hulladbaj kaha karte the
 At one time he wrote a letter to Jawaharlal Nehru and severely reprimanded for supporting the revolutionary youth
 janvari 1923 main motilal nehru va deshbandhu chitaranjan das sareekhe dhanadhy logon ne milakar swaraj party bana lee
 The young men announced the Revolutionary Party as the ad hoc party

 If seen, it was his great visionary thinking at that time
 suprasiddh krantikari lala hardayal, jo un dinon videsh main rahakar hindustan ko swatantra karaane kii ranneeti banane main jute hue the, ram prasad bismil ke sampark main swami somdev ke samay se hi the
 Lala ji had written a letter to Ram Prasad Bismil and advised him to prepare the constitution of the new party by meeting Shachindranath Sanyal and Yadu Gopal Mukherjee

 The name of the newly formed party was abbreviated as HRA and its constitution was printed on yellow leaflet and sent to the members
 3 oktober 1924 ko is party kii ek kaaryakarini-baithak kanpur main kii gayi jisamen shachindranath sanyaal, yogesh chandra chatarji va ram prasad bismil aadi kai pramukh sadsy shaamil hue
 In this meeting, Sanyal and Chatterjee went to Bengal by handing over the leadership of the party to Bismil

 This is mentioned in the decision of the Chief Court of Oudh

 In this revolutionary published in English as The Revolutionary, the ideological thinking of revolutionaries * can be understood well
 is patr kaa avikal hindi kavyanuwaad ab hindi vicistrot par bhi uplabdh he
 Seeing this 4-page manifesto published as The Revolutionary, the British government started searching for its author in Bengal
 sanyog se shacheendra nath sanyaal bankura main us samay giraftaar kar liye gayi jab ve yah ghoshnaptr apane kisi saathi ko post karne ja rahe the
 Similarly, as soon as Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee got a party meeting from Kanpur, he got off the train at Howrah station that he was caught with a lot of copies of the HRA Constitution
 unhen hazaribagh jail main band kar diya gaya
 After the arrest of both the prominent leaders, the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh as well as the revolutionary members of Bengal came on the shoulders of Ram Prasad Bismil
 bismil kaa swabhaav tha ki ve yaa to kisi kaam ko haath main lete na the or yadi ek baar kaam haath main le liya to use puraa kiye bagaiyr chhodte na the
 There was a need for money for the work of the party earlier, but now it has increased even more
 kahin se bhi dhan praapt hota na dekh unhone 7 march 1925 ko bichpuri tathaa 24 may 1925 ko dwarkapur main do raajnneetik dakaitiyaan daaleen
 But he could not get any special money in them
 in donon dakaitiyon main ek-ek vyakti maukey par hi maaraa gaya
 Due to this, Bismil's soul suffered immensely
 antatah unhone yah pakkaa nishchay kar liya ki ve ab keval sarkari khajaana hi lootenge, hindustan ke kisi bhi rais ke ghar dakaiti bilkul na daalenge
 a decision was made at an emergency meeting held on 7 August 1925 at his house in Shahjahanpur and on 9 August 1925, a total of 10 people led by Bismil from Shahjahanpur railway station, including Ashfaq Ulla Khan, Rajendra Lahiri, Chandrashekhar Azad, Shacheendranath Bakshi, Manmathanath Gupt, Mukundi Lal, Keshav Chakraborty, Murari Sharma and Banwari Lal, boarded the 8 Down saharanpur-lucknow passenger train

 The range of these mausers was also higher than that of ordinary pistols
 un dinon ye moujar aaj kii e ke - 47 raifal kii tarah charchit the
 Stopping at Kakori railway station before Lucknow, as soon as the train moved forward, the revolutionaries pulled the chain and stopped it and dropped the box of government treasury from the guard compartment
 use kholane kii koshish kii gayi kintu jab vah nahin khulaa to ashfak ulla khan ne apana moujar manmathanath gupt ko pakadaa diya or hathaudaa lekar baksaa todane main jute gayi
 Manmathnath Gupta eagerly pressed the trigger of the Maujar, causing the missed bullet to the passenger named Ahmed Ali
 vah maukey par hi dher ho gaya
 In a hurry, a sheet of leather filled with silver coins and notes was tied in sheets and a sheet was left there to escape from there
 agle din akhabaaron ke madhyam se yah khabar puure sansar main fail gayi
 The British government took this train robbery seriously and handed over the task of investigating the fastest police in Scotland, under the leadership of Mr
 RA Harton, an assistant to the D
I
G
 si ai di ne gambheer chaanbin karke sarkaar ko is baat kii pushti kar di ki kakori train dakaiti krantikariyon kaa ek suniyojit shadyantr he
 The police put up advertisements in all the prominent places to give information in connection with the Kakori case and announce the reward for arresting any person involved in the conspiracy
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki police ko ghatnasthal par mili chadar main lage dhobi ke nishaan se is baat kaa pataa chal gaya ki chadar shahjahanpur ke hi kisi vyakti kii he
 On inquiring from the dhobis of Shahjahanpur it was found that the chadar was of Banarasi Lal
 banarsi laal se milakar police ne sara bhed praapt kar liya
 It was also known that on 9 August 1925, who were his partymen from Shahjahanpur went out of the city and when did they return? When intelligence was confirmed that Ram Prasad Bismil, the leader of HR was not in the city that day, then on the night of 26 September 1925, Bismil was accompanied by more than 40 people from all over India
 Was arrested
 kakori kand main keval 10 hi log vaastavik rup se shaamil hue the at: un sabhi ko namjad kiya gaya
 Except five of them - Chandrashekhar Azad, Murari Sharma, Keshav Chakraborty, Ashfaq Ulla Khan and Shachindra Nath Bakshi, who did not come into the hands of the police, the remaining people were prosecuted and sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment

 The police broke Banarasi Lal in the lockup, fearing severe punishment
 shahjahanpur jila congress cameti main party-fund ko lekar isi banarsi kaa bismil se jhagada ho chukaa tha
 Bismil, who was then the Auditor of the District Congress Committee, suspended Banarasi from the primary membership of the Congress party, proving allegations of embezzlement in the party fund
 baad main jab gandhi ji 16 oktober 1920 ko shahjahanpur aaye to banarsi ne unase milakar apana paksh rakkha
 At that time, Gandhiji made a reconciliation between the two, saying that they should not give so much money to the small hera-hai
 parantu banarsi bada hi dhoort aadmi tha
 He first apologized to Bismil and then took Gandhiji aside and filled his ears that Ramprasad is a very criminal type
 ve isaki kisi baat kaa na to swayan vishwaas karen na hi kisi or ko karne den
 Later, this Banarasi Lal befriended Bismil and gained his trust before sweet talks and then became a partner in the cloth business with him
 jab bismil ne gandhi ji kii aalochana karte hue apni alag party bana lee to banarsi laal atyadhik prasann hua or maukey kii talash main chup saadhe baitha rahaa
 The police, knowing the difference between Bismil and Banarasi's previous quarrel with the local people, made Banarasi Lal an approver and used it as an infallible tool in the entire prosecution against Bismil
 banarsi laal vyapaar main saajheedaar hone ke kaaran party sambandhi aisi-aisi gopneey baaten jaanata tha, jinhen bismil ke atirikt or koi bhi na jaan saktaa tha
 It is mentioned by Ram Prasad Bismil in his autobiography
 lakhanu jila jail, jo un dinon sanyukt praant kii central jail kehalaati thi, kii 11 nambar barrack main sabhi krantikariyon ko ek saath rakkha gaya or hajratganj chauraahey ke paas ring theatre naam kii ek aaleeshaan building main asthai adaalat kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 This building, named Ring Theater, used to be between Kothi Hayat Bakhsh and Mallika Ahad Mahal, in which British officers used to entertain themselves by watching movies and drama etc
 isi ring theatre main lagaataar 18 maheene tak king emperor varses ram prasad 'bismil' and adars ke naam se chalaaye gayi aitihaasik mukademe main british sarkaar ne 10 lakh rupee us samay kharch kiye the jab sone kaa mulya 20 rupee tola hua karata tha
 This building was also demolished later by the orders of the British rulers, and in its place in 1929-1932, a second grand building was named as GPO Lucknow
 1947 main jab bharat aaazaad ho gaya to yahan gandhi ji kii bhavy pratimaa sthapit karke rahi sahi kasar nehru sarkaar ne puri kar di
 When the non-congress Janata government was first formed at the center, at the time of the Kakori martyr's half-century celebrations organized in 1977, with the collective efforts of the surviving revolutionaries of that time, the Kakori pillar was unveiled by Uttar Pradesh Governor Ganpatirao Devrao Tapase here so that the site May the memory of is aitihaasik mukademe main sarkari kharche se harkarannath mishra ko krantikariyon kaa vakil niyukt kiya gaya jabaki jawaharlal nehru ke rishte main saale lagane vaale suprasiddh vakil jagatnarayan 'mullah' ko ek sochi samajhi ranneeti ke antargat sarkari vakil banaaya gaya
 Jagat Narayan left no stone unturned to get all the revolutionaries punished severely
 yah vahi jagat narayan the jinaki marji ke khilaaf san 1916 main bismil ne lokmaanya balgangadhar tilak kii bhavy shobhaayatra puure lakhanu shahar main nikaali thi
 Irked by this, in the Mainpuri conspiracy, the same Mullaji insisted on his status as a government lawyer, but he could not expose even one child of Ram Prasad Bismil as Bismil escaped in the Mainpuri conspiracy and for two years, the police only Do not come

 Though none of these accused got involved in this scheme for their personal benefit but since neither has done any remorse over their work nor has pledged to keep themselves away from such activities in future hence Whatever punishment has been given has been thoughtfully done and in this condition no exemption of any kind can be given in it
 phir bhi, inamen se koi bhi abhiyukt yadi likhit main pashchaatap prakat karata he or bhavishya main aisa na karne kaa vachan detaa he to unki apil par apper court vichaar kar sakati he
 The absconding revolutionaries arrested Ashfaq Ullah Khan and Shachindra Nath Bakshi much later

 Jagatnarayan 'mulla' was tasked with keeping the government side, while KC Dutt, Jayakaranath Mishra and Kripa Shankar Hajela, on behalf of the convicted revolutionaries, advocated Rajendra Nath Lahiri, Thakur Roshan Singh and Ashfaq Ullah Khan respectively

 When Bismil argued against the verdict in fluent English in front of the Chief Court, then Mulla ji, the public prosecutor, looked at the armpits
 bismil kii is tark kshamta par chif justise louis sharts ko unase yah poochna padaa - "mistar ramprasad! from vitch univarsity you haev teken da degree of laa?" is par unhone hans kar kaha tha- "excuj me sar! e kingmekar dajant rikhwire eni degree
 "the court was irritated by this reply and rejected the plea made by Bismil on 18 July 1927 itself
 uske baad unhone 76 prishth kii tarkpurna likhit bahes pesh kii
 After reading it, the judges expressed doubt that Bismil had written this debate by some jurist instead of writing it himself
 aakhirkaar adaalat dwaara unheen lakshmishankar mishra ko bahes karne kii ijaajat di gayi jinhen lene se bismil ne manaa kar diya tha
 The trial of Kakori case was going on in Lucknow

 He used the word "mulajim" instead of "muljiman" for the accused
 phir kya tha, pandit ram prasad 'bismil' ne tapaak se un par ye chutili fabti kasi: "mulajim hamako mat kahiye, bada afsos hota he; adaalat ke adab se ham yahan tasharif laaye hai
 We turn around with our juridis; That we have also lit lamps in the intestines often

 He is a political prisoner, so deal with him

 Then they did not cross-examine that day
 chif court main shacheendra nath sanyaal, bhoopendra nath sanyaal va banavaari laal ko chhodkar shesh sabhi krantikariyon ne apil kii thi
 According to the judgment which was given on 22 August 1927, Ram Prasad Bismil, Rajendra Nath Lahiri and Ashfaq Ullah Khan were imprisoned for life under 121 and 120 of IPC, and 302 and 396 according to hanging and Thakur Roshan Singh
 5 + 5 = 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in two cases and hanged according to the next two times

 Finally, a delegation of five persons headed by Madan Mohan Malaviya went to Shimla and met the Viceroy and prayed that all these four accused had written to the government that they would undertake any such activity in future
 Will not participate and he has also expressed remorse for his actions, so Judgment can be reconsidered

 Despite this the Viceroy flatly refused him
 antatah barrister mohan laal saxena ne privi kauncil main kshamaadaan kii yachika ke dastauez taiyaar karke england ke vikhyath vakil es el polak ke paas bhijwaye
 But the judges of London and the legal advisors of the emperor argued very strongly that Ram Prasad Bismil, the architect of this conspiracy, is a very dangerous and professional criminal
 yadi use kshamaadaan diya gaya to vah bhavishya main isse bhi bada or bhayankar kand kar saktaa he
 In that case it will be impossible for the government to rule in India
 is sabakaa parinaam yah hua ki privi kauncil main bheji gayi kshamaadaan kii apil bhi khaarij ho gayi
 On 16 December 1927, Bismil completed the last chapter of his autobiography and sent him out of prison
