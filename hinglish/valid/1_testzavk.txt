 There are five distinct differences of this proceeds
 pehle sudhaa naamak shiv ne ise praapt kiya tha
 Consume its communication with them; Then ashes in God
 tritiy aagam chitya he
 Its magnitude was also a lax verse
 iske chha: avaantar bhed hai
 The name of Shiva who received it is Deept
 deept se gopati ne, phir gopati se ambika ne praapt kiya
 The fourth Shivagam is the reason
 iskaa pariman ek koti shloke he
 It has seven distinctions
 ise praapt karanevaale kramash: kaaran, kaaran se sharv, sharv se prajapati hai
 The fifth proceeds Ajit
 iskaa pariman ek laksh shloke he
 There are four distinct differences

 The name of Sastha Agam is Sudipta
 ise praapt karanevaalon ke naam kramash: ish, ish se trimurti, trimurti se hutashan
 The seventh name is subtle
 iske koi avaantar bhed nahin hai
 The names of those who received it are Subtle, Bhava and Prabhanjan respectively
 ashtum aagam kaa naam sahasr he
 There are ten distinct differences
 ise praapt karanevaalon main kaal, bhim or khag hai
 Navam Agam is well known
 ise pehle dhanesh ne praapt kiya, dhanesh se vighanesh or vighanesh se shashi ne
 The tenth is Agam Anshuman, which has 12 distinctions
 ise praapt karanevaalon ke naam kramash: anshu abr or ravi hai
 The above list of ten agams is based on Kiranagam

? shrikanthi samhita main rudragamon kii jo suchi he usamen raurav, vimal, visar or sourabhed ye chaar naam adhik hai
 And there are no four names Virakta, Kauravya, Makut and Agnayya in it
 koi-koi aisa anumaan karte hai ki ye kauravy hi raurav hai
 The other three are different from them
 ashtadash agam kaa naam kahin nahin miltaa
 It has the names of Kiran, Parameshwar and Raurav
 nepal main aathvin shatabdi kaa gupt lipi main likhaa hua nixshwaas tantra samhita naamak granth he
 In this, there are five divisions of cosmic religion, root sutra, answer sutra, new sutra, guhyas sutra
 loukik sutara praaia: upekshit ho gaya he
 The remaining four are called Uttarasutras
 is uttar sutara main 18 pracheen shiv sutron kaa namollekh he
 These names are actually the names of the famous Shivagam by the same name, as isamen 10 shivatantron ke naam he yatha - carmik, yogaj, divya, kaaran, ajit, deept sookshm, sahasr anshuman or suprabhed
 These names are found in the Brahmayamala chapter 39 - Vijay, Selfless, Swayambhuva, Babul, Virabhadra, Raurava, Mukut, Veeresh, Chandra Gyan, Prodgit Lalit, Siddha Santanaka, Sarvodgitha, Kiran and Parameshwara
 kaamik aagam main bhi 18 tantro kaa namollekh he
 Harprasad Shastri had seen a copy of Ashtadash Agam in Nepal which was written in 624 AD
 bandal sahab kaa kathan he ki kembridge unvarsity librori main 'parameshwaraf aagam' naamak ek 895 i0 kii haath kii likhi pothee he
 Dr
 Prabodhchandra Bagchi says that the composition of the 'nayottara Sutra' mentioned earlier may be from the sixth to the seventh AD
 'brahmayamal' ke anusaar ni:shwaas aadi tantra shiv ke madhya strot se udbhoot hue the or urdhv vaksh se nikle hai
 According to the Brahmayamala, post-mortem or head-waters are emanating from the left source
 jaydrathyamal main bhi he ki shirched se nayottar or mahasanmohan - ye teen tantra shiv ke balm strot se udbhoot hai
 Dvaita and Dvaitadvaita Shaiva Agam is very ancient, no doubt
 parantu jis sarup main ve milte hai or madhya yug main bhi jis prakaar unka varnan miltaa he, usase gyaat hota he ki uskaa yah rup ati pracheen nahin he
 Due to various historical circumstances due to time differences, such a change has taken place
 phir bhi aisa mana ja saktaa he ki madhya yug main prachlit pancharaatr aagam kaa ati pracheen rup jaisaa mahabharat shanti parv main dikhaai detaa he usee prakaar shaivagam ke vishay me bhi sambhavit he
 According to the salvation festival of Mahabharata, Shri Krishna himself studied the dvaita and dvaitadvaita shaivagam from Upamanyu
 'kaamik aagam' main he ki sadashiv ke panchmukhon main se pancharaatr sroton kaa sambandh he
 That is why the total sources are 25
 paanch mukhon ke paanch sroton ke naam hai- The five faces are as follows- 'som siddhant' ke anusaar loukik tantra paanch prakaar ke hai or vaidic bhi paanch prakaar ke hai
 The idea of mutual elimination or abjection is found in all these systems
 tadnusaar urdhvadi paanch dishaao ke bhed ke kaaran tantron ke vishay main taratamya hota he
 This implies that the mechanisms emanating from the upward direction are the best
 uske baad purv, phir uttar, pashchim, phir dakshin
 According to this sequence, the theorists pandit people say that the theory is best because it is liberating
 uske ananthar krmanusaar sarpavish naashak garudagyaan, sarvavashikaran pratipadak kamgyaan, bhuton kaa nivarak fa bhoottantra or shatrudaman ke liye upyogi fa bhairav tantra fa kaa sthaan jaananaa chahie
 In this context, it is necessary to know one more thing that from the Vedic point of view, there are two types of knowledge in the form of knowledge - first 'bodh Roop' and second 'word form'
 usee prakaar tantra sahitya main bhi gyaan ke do rup paae jate hai
 It is needless to say that cognitive knowledge is superior to verbal knowledge, there are different types of this form of knowledge because knowledge is differentiated according to the distinction of the subject
 jo gyaan shiv kaa pratipadak he usase pashu or maaya kaa pratipadak gyaan nikrusht he
 That is why differences of knowledge have been conceived from differences like pure path, impure road, mixed road etc
 shabdaatmak gyaan ko fa shaastra fa kehete hai
 There are also differences in it
 siddhantiyon ke matanusaar vedadik gyaan se siddhant gyaan vishuddh he, isaliye shreshth he parantu siddhant gyaan main bhi parapar bhed hai
 In the same way, there are many different distinctions of illiterate knowledge - moral, physical, nirbiz, vegetables, temporal etc
 isse prathit hota he ki mul main gyaan ek hone par bhi pratipaadya vishay ke kaaran parapar bhed roopon main prakat hota he
 The 'swayambhuva Agam' states- 'kaamik aagam' main bhi hai ki parapar bhed se gyaan kshadhikari bhed hote hai
 In it, according to the antagonistic subject, there is matrigya, parigyan and animal knowledge or additional knowledge
 shiv prakaashan gyaan shreshth hai
 Pashupadadi Earth publication is an additional knowledge
 isi prakaar vividh kalpanaayen hai parantu shiv or rudra donon siddhant gyaap hai
 The Acharya of the Pashupat sect considered the Pramanasya of the Ashtadash Rudragams, but Dasa Shiva did not believe in the Pramanaya of knowledge
 iskaa karna yah he ki rudragam main dwait dashti or advat dashti kaa mishran paaya jaataa hai
 But in Shivagam, considered as monotheistic vision, Acharya Abhinaya Gupta has said that Pashupat Darshan is not always good
 kisi kisi granth main spasht rup se dikhya gaya he ki shiv ke kin mukhon se kin aagmon kaa nirgam hua hai
 From this it is evident that Kamik, Yogaj, Chitya, Rasa and Ajit these five Shivagams were descended from Shiva's sadhojat mukh
 ditp, sookshm, saharutra, anshumat yaa anshmaan samprabhed ye paanch shivagam shiv ke bamdev naamak mukh se nirgat hue hai
 These five rudrahagas, triumphs, breathlessness, swabhuva, agnayas and valas, came out of Shiva's Aghor Mukh
 raurav, mukut, vimal gyaan, chandrakant or bib, ye paanch rudragam shiv ke ishan mukh se nisruth hue the
 Prodgeet, Lalit, Siddha, progeny, Vatul, Kirana, Supreme and Parameshwara These eight Rudragams were descended from Shiva's male counterparts
 is prakaar ashtavinshati aagam ke 198 vibhaagon main aagmon kii charchaa dikhaai detii hai
 64 Bhairavagams are instructed in the Srikanth Samhita
 ye sab aagam addhait siddhant ke pratipadak hai
 Their names are as follows: 802 i0 main chaar tantragranth bharat se kamboj gaye the
 Among them, these three texts Nishtikha, Shirakhatha and Sanmoh are present in the list
 vinashikha shuddh nayagranth he
 Dr
 Prabodhchandra Bagchi has referred to it as the Destroyer
 yah vinashikha kaa hi apbhransh prathit hota he
 The fourth book is named Nyaya
 
 Dr
 Bagchi understands that the handwritten book of the 'self-reliance Code' in Nepal and which is given in page 137 of the first section of the Nepal Durbar Catalog is the renaming of the expiratory system under Ashtadash Rudragam
 iske chaar bhaag yaa sutara he
 Together they are known by the name of post-natal system
 bhagavan shankaracharya ne anand lahari stotra main likhaa he- It states that Pashupati has given a description of the worship that has attained some effort in the 64 Tantra of the entire world
 ant main unhone jagadamba ke anurodh se yavat purushartho ko ek saath praapt karaanevaale ekmaatr mahashakti ke shaktipratipadak tantra ko prakaat kiya tha
 It has been said that in the Saubhagyavardhini Tika, the expression of this verse has been done in this way - Devi told Shankar that you should create such a system which, despite being one, is beneficial to all kinds of efforts
 devi kaa anurodh sunakar shankar ne 'kaadimtakhya' swatantra tantra kaa prakaash kiya
 And Tantra is mutually relative but this Tantra is famous as independent Tantra due to being secular
 tantric samaaj main isi kaaran isi ko 'anadi tantra' mana jaataa he
 Commentator Lakshmidhar has said that the first line of this verse has been considered as an 'research' text
 parantu yah uchit nahin prathit hota
 According to them, its pure text is 'ati Sandhya'
 is pad kaa taatpary he- 'vanchanaa' 
 If this is believed, then this verse would mean that Mahamaya has betrayed the Vishwa Prapancha by the 64 Tantras of Shambar Prabhuti
 inamen prayek main kisi na kisi siddhi kaa vivaran he
 That is why Devi's special request to Shankar was that they seekers of all efforts make a system
 yah mukhya rup se 'bhagwati tantra' he
 The name of 'chatushthishtantra' is in 'chatushthi'
 in tantron ke vaktaa shankar hai or shrota parvati
 These are all systems destroying the world and remote from the Vedic route
 yah lakshmidhar kii vyakhya kaa taatpary he
 'arunamodini' commentary is followed by Laxmidhar
 is mat main 65wein tantra ke sambandh main kaha gaya he ki vah bhagwaan kaa 'mantrarahasy he' jo shivshakti donon varna ke sanmishran se upahatmukh he
 The names of the 64 Tantras in the chatu-shati and the interpretation of Lakshmidhar provided in 'beautylahi Tika' over them are as follows- kr0san0 1-2 mahamaya tantra or sambar tantra: isamen maaya, prapanch, nirmaan kaa vivaran he
 With its effect, the senses of the seer do not accept the corresponding subject and take it otherwise
 jaisaa vastu - jagat main ghat he yah drashtaa ke nikat pratibhaat hota he- fa patf rup main
 This corresponds in some part to the hypnotism prevalent in the present era, Prabhriti Mohini Vidya
 kr0 san0 3
 - yogini jaal sambar : mayapradhan tantra ko sambar kaha jaataa he
 a web of yoginis is seen in it
 isaki sadhana karanevaale ke liye shmashaan prabhruti sthanon main updisht niamein kaa anusaran karnaa padataa he
 Tattva Shankar - This is 'mahendra Jala Vidya'
 iske dwaara ek tatv ko duusare tatv ke rup main bhasman kiya ja saktaa he; jaise prithvi ttatv main jal t va kaa yaa jal t va main prithvi tatv kaa
 5-12 Siddha Bhairava, Batuk Bhairava, Skeleton Bhairava, Kaal Bhairava, Kalagni Bhairava, Yogini Bhairava, Maha Bhairava and Shakti Bhairava
 in granthon main nidhi vidya kaa varnan he or aihak faldaayak kapalik mat kaa vivaran he
 All these tantras are nonsensical
 13-20 bahuroopastak, brahmi, maheshwari, comari, vaishnavi, vaarahi, chamuda, shvidooti, 
 These are all maternal forms derived from power
 in aath maatrikaaon ke vishay main aath tantra likhe gaye the
 According to Lakshmidhar, all these are non-spiritual
 inamen aanushanbik rup se shri vidya kaa prasang rahane se yah vaidic saadhakon ke liye upadey nahin he
 21-28 Yamalashtak: The word Yamala means Kayasiddha Amba
 aath tantron main yamlasiddhi kaa varnan miltaa he
 This is also the Avadic system
 16- chandragyaan: is tantra main 16 vidyaon kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Nevertheless, it is due to Kapalik opinion
 chandragyaan naam se vaidic-vidya-granth bhi he parantu vah chatu:shashthee tantra se baahar he
 30-malini Vidya: It has description of ocean
 yah bhi avaidic he
 31-mahasammohan: The practice of sublimating the awake man
 yah bal jihybhed aadi upayon se siddh hota he, at: hey he
 32-36-vamyupat Tantra: Mahadev Tantra, Vatul Tantra, Vatulotar Tantra, Kamik Tantra, these are all Mishra Tantras
 inamen kisi na kisi ansh main vaidic baaten pai jaati hai parantu adhikansh main avaidic hai
 37-heart Tantra and Guhyantra: The secret of Prakriti Tantra is described in secret
 is vidya ke anushthan main naanaa prakaar se hinsadi kaa prasang he at: yah avaidic he
 40-artism: There are exponents of Chandrakala in this work, even if it is malefic, eclipse eclipse and salvation is the eclipse of ten places, and the use of Chandrakala Saurabh Prabhriti is not workable in the form of purusha
 ise chhodkar nishiddh aacharon kaa upadesh is granth main he
 The prohibition of this is even if not Kapalik
 41-kalasaar: isamen karrne ke utkarshsaadhan kaa upaay varnit he
 Vamachara has the predominance in this system
 142-kundika mat: isamen guticasiddhi kaa varnan he
 There is also the predominance of Vamachara in this
 43-matothar mat: isamen rassiddhi kaa vivechan he
 44-vinayakhirtatra: Tinaya is the name of a particular yogini
 is granth main is yagini ko siddh karne kaa upaay batalaaya gaya he
 Vinaya is not a yogini by anyone's opinion; The name of Sambhogakshini is Vinaya
 45-trotal tantra:isamen ghutikaa or padukasiddhi kaa vivaran he
 46-trotlottar Tantra: It describes the remedy of philosophy of 64,000 Yakshinis
 47-panchamrita: prithvi prabhruti panchabhuton kaa maradbhaav pind, ad main kaise sambhav ho saktaa he, iskaa vishay isamen he
 This is also a Kapalik text
 48-52 rupabhed, bhootadaamar, kulsaar, kuloddish, kulchudamani, in paanch tantron main mantradi prayog se shatru ko maarane kaa upaay varnit he
 This is also a non-scripture
 53-57 sarvagyanotir, mahakali mat, arunosh, madnish, vikuntheshwar, ye paanch tantra ' digambar ' sampradaay ke granth hai
 This sect is a distinction of Kapalika sect
 58-64 purv, pashchim, utar, dakshin, nirutar, vimal, vimlotar or devimat ye ' chhapanak sampradaay ' ke granth hai
 The aforementioned brief shows that these 64 systems are only for global accomplishment or benefit
 parmaarthik kalyaan kaa kisi prakaar sandhan inamen nahin mil saktaa
 According to Laxmidhar, they are all non-spiritual
 is prasang main lakshmidhar ne kaha he ki paramakalyanik parameshwar ne is prakaar ke tantron kii abtarana kii, yah ek prashn he
 In order to solve this, he has said that Pashupati had composed the four varnas of Brahmins and Marmudrabhishikta Prabhriti Anulom, Pratilom for all humans
 isamen bhi sabakaa adhikaar sab tantron main nahin he
 Brahmin etc
 has been given the right of three varnas
 adhikarbhed se hi vayavasthabhed he
 What Chandrakala Vidya has been told earlier is different from 'chandrakala Vigyan'
 'chandrakala vidya' ke antargat chandrakala, jayotsanavati, kularnav, kulshri, bhubaneshwari, barhospaty durvasamat or in sab tantron kaa samavesh hua he jinamein teen varnon kaa adhikaar he, parantu triwarna vishay main anushthan kaa vidhaan dakshin maarg se hi he
 The Shudras also have the right but their ritual legislation is in the left path
 is vidya main mul maarg, samay maarg kaa samanvay dekh padataa he
 Shubhagam Panchak - These five Agams are under the time route
 inamen naam hai - vasishtha samhita, sanak samhita, sanandan samhita, shuksanhita sanatkumar samhita
 All this is Vedic Margashvayi
 vasishtadi paanch muni is maarg ke pradarshak hai
 It was implemented on the basis of 'samyachara'
 lakshmidhar kaa kathan he ki shankaracharya swayan samayaachaar kaa anuran karte the
 Shubhagam Panchak gives the pure time route
 dasamen shodash vidyaon kaa pratipaadan mul vidya ke antargat sweekaar karte hue kiya gaya he
 Hence it is taken as 'ang Vidya'
 parantu chatuhshashthee vidya ke antarbhukt chandragyaan vidya main shodash vidyaon kaa praadhanya mana gaya he
 Therefore it is called 'kaulmarg'
 pehle jo swatantra tantra kii baat kahi gai he - jiskaa ullekh 'saundaryalahari' main miltaa he- uske vishay main bhaskar raay ke 'sethubandh' main kaha gaya he ki vah 'vamakeshtantr' ho saktaa he
 Nityashedsharanava is under this system
 saundaryalahari ke tikaakar gaurikot ne kaha he ki 64 tantra ke atirikt ek mitra he vah 'gnanarnav' ho saktaa he parantu duusare sampradaay ke matanusaar savatantra visheshan se prathit hota he ki vah 'tantraraj' naamak vishisht tantra kaa dyotak he
 64 systems are named in Todalantra
 is namasuchee ko aadhunik maananaa samichin he
 Sarvanand has given these names of 'todal Tantra' in his 'sarvallas Tantra'
 is suchi kii aalochana se jaan padataa he ki yah chatu:shatee kii suchi se vilakshan he hi, 'shrikanthi' suchi se bhi vilakshan he
 The list found in the Sarvallasodhodadadalantra is as follows- Kali, Mundmala, Tara, Tanarvan, Sivasar, Veer Nidasrn, Latharchan, Taul, Neel, Radha, Vidyasar, Bhairava, Bhairavi, Siddheshwar, Matrubhed, Samaya, Guptasadhak, Maya, Mahamaya , Akshaya, Kumari, Kularnava, Kalikakulasarvasva, Kalikakala, Varahi, Yogini, yoginihriday, Santakumar, tripurasara, Yogininijaya, Malini, Poultry, Sriganesh, Bhoot, Udish, Kamadhenu, Ut R, Veerabhadra, Vamakeshwar, Kulchudabhani, Bhavchudamani, Gyanarnava, Varada, Tantrachintamani, Virunavilas, Hansatutra, Chidambantra, Svetavaridh, Nitya, Utara, Narayani, Gyandeep, Gautamiya, Tanrutar, Garjan, Kubjika, Mayatrishyakram, Tantra dasharathi tantra ke dwitiya adhyay main 64 tantron kaa namollekh paaya jaataa he

 The total population of the West Indies Union was between 3 and 4 million, with a greater number of black people of West African descent

 There was also a large population of mixed descent, in terms of religion, a large number of Catholics and Protestants, with the largest population apart from some Hindus and Muslims

 The largest island was Jamaica which was located in the northwest of the Union

 This association was spread over all the islands in the Caribbean: apni chaudaai main, caman dweep se barbados tak yah kareeb 2,425 kilometre failaa he or uttar main turk and koicos dweep se ikacos point tak or dakshin main trinidad tak yah 1,700 kilometre tak vistaarit he 
 However, most of the area of these two distances is surrounded by water
 tulanaatmak rup se great britain akshansh ke kareeb 10 degree bhar main failaa he or spain deshaantar ke lagbhag 20 degree ke paar failaa hua he
 However, the West Indies was spread over such a vast area that most of its provinces were closely contiguous in the eastern Caribbean, where Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands were obvious exceptions

 Many islands fall under the category of traditional storms with Trinidad being the exception, hence the risk of wind risk and flood damage

 The union is currently considered geographically part of the North American continent because all of its islands are within and around the Caribbean, although only Trinidad is located off the South America coast and is located on the same continent

 haalaanki 1971 ke aasapaas guyana ne sambhawatah bade deele tareeke se caribbean sangh ke liye punah prayaas kiya tha
 The Union was an internal self-state, a federal state made up of ten provinces, all of which were British colonial territories
 is mahasang kaa nirmaan united kingdom dwaara 1958 main adhikansh british westeindies se kiya gaya tha
 Britain intended that this union would soon become an independent state and thus it was fulfilling the demands of independence of all the territories of the region

 The legal basis for this federation was the British Caribbean Union Act 1956 and the date of formation - 3 January 1958 - was established by an order-in-council announced in 1957

 yah pad rajya ke sangheey swaroop ko parilakshith kar saktaa tha, yaa sangh ke jald hi swatantra ho jane kii apekshaaon kaa sanket de rahaa tha
 The Governor General by the British Government also had the ability to veto any legislation passed by the Union

 The Senate consisted of nineteen members

 Each unit was represented by two members

 However, the government was not a cabinet but a council of state

 There was also a federal Supreme Court consisting of a Chief Justice and three other judges

 Port of Spain was generally the Confederate capital for the duration of the Union's existence
 pehle sangheey chunaav kii taiyaar ke liye, sthaneey raajnneetik dalon ke parisangh ke rup main do mahasangheey-vyapak partiyon ko yojit kiya gaya
 Both were organized by Jamaican leaders: the Federal Labor Party of the West Indies by Norman Manley and the Democratic Labor Party by Alexander Bustamante
 vyapak sandarbh main, dabluelpi, puure sangh main shahari aadhaarit partiyon se bana tha, jabaki dlapi main gramin aadhaarit partiyaan shaamil thim
 a small third party, the Federal Democratic Party, was founded in November 1957 by a group in Trinidad, although the party failed to win a single seat
 donon pramukh rashtriya dalon ke liye kai minon main platform samaan the
 Both advocated maintaining and strengthening ties with the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada: the emphasis on encouraging and expanding tourism; In order to obtain loans, for financial assistance and technical assistance, insisted on trying to bring British Guiana and British Honduras into the Union
 in samaantaaon ke baavjood, vahaan kaaphi matbhed the
 The WIFLP advocated the promotion of agriculture, while the DLP promised a favorable climate for both private industry and the development of labor, human and economic resources
 dabluelpi ne bahama ko sangh main shaamil hone ke liye protsaahit karne kaa vaada kiya, jabaki dlapi ne nahin kiya
 The WIFLP also campaigned for the establishment of a central bank to expand credit resources and advocated complete internal self-government for a democratic socialist society and all unit territories, while avoiding issues of the independence movement and a custom union
 dlapi ne purna aantarik swashaasan ke bare main kuch nahin kaha, par samaajwaad par hamalaa kiya, ucch karadhaan se bachane kii koshish kii or west indies kii ekta kii kaamana kii, puja kii swatantraaa or abhivyakti or trade unionon ke protsaahan par bal diya
 a federal election was held on March 25, 1958
 dabluelpi ne 26 siton ke saath chunaav main jeet hasil kii jabaki dlapi 19 siton ko hi hasil kar paaya
 The WIFLP received the bulk of the seats from the smaller islands, while the DLP received a majority in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago
 dlapi ne jamaica main 11 siton or trinidad main 6 siton main jeet hasil kii
 While appointing the Senate, the Governor General Lord Hales realized that only the St
 Vincent Island government was controlled by the DLP, with the result that the Senate was going to the disproportionately WIFLP
 ek vivaadaaspad faisle main unhone jamaica or trinidad main vipaksh dlapi samoohon se sampark kiya or un dwipon main se prayek se ek dlapi seenetter niyukt kiya he
 Thus the Senate consisted of 15 WIFLP members and 4 DLP members

 Adams's selection as prime minister was indicative of the future problems of the union
 dabluelpi ke sambhavi netaa jamaica ke pradhanmantri norman manale the or uske baad taarkik rup se trinidad and tobago ke premier dow erik williams the
 But both did not contest the federal election and preferred to retain control of their respective island
 iskaa arth yah tha ki do sabase mahatvapurn praanton ke netaaon ne sangh ko vyavhaarya ke rup main nahin dekha
 Similarly, Jamaican founder Alexander Bustamante of DLP also declined to contest the union and left the party leadership for Trinidadian Ashford Sinanan

 The federal structure of the West Indies Union was unusually weak
 udhaaharan ke liye, iske praant ek ekal custom union main shaamil nahin the
 Thus, each province was acting as a separate economy with tariffs, mainly because smaller provinces were afraid of being overwhelmed by the economies of the larger island
 iske alaava, sangh ke bheetar andolan kii puri swatantraaa ko lagu nahin kiya gaya, kyonki bade praant chote dwipon se bade paimaane par palaayan ke bare main chintit the
 In this sense, it can be said that the current European Union has implemented a more integrated economic environment than the West Indian effort
 or na hi sangheey sarkaar kaary karne ke liye apane ghatak rajyon ko laa pai
 The initial federal budget was quite small, which restricted the federal government from using its financial generosity as a carrot
 vah united kingdom or apane sadsy deshon ke anudaan par nirbhar tha
 The provincial budgets of Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago were both larger than the federal budget
 iske chalate un rajyon se sangheey sarkaar ke liye adhik se adhik vitt poshan pradaan ke anurodhon ko doharaaya gaya
 These requests were ignored because both Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago had already contributed about 85 percent of federal revenue, roughly in equal parts
 iske alaava, pradhanmantri kaa pad kaaphi kamjor tha
 Unlike other Westminster systems with the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of the West Indian Union could not dissolve Parliament
 vishesh rup se sangh ne canada ke saath kareebi sambandhon ko banaae rakhaa tha, jiskaa ateet bhi is rup main samaan tha ki vah kai purv british upniveshon kaa ek mahasang tha
 In the early years, many Caribbean leaders suggested that the West Indies Union should investigate the possibility of becoming a Canadian province, though it was never more than a fleeting one
 vaarta ke khandit hone ke baavjood, may 1961 main canada ne kshetra ke do sabase mahatvapurn uphaar ko westeindies sangh ko prastut kiya: do vyapaaree jahaaj, jiskaa naam da fedral palm or ga fedral mapel tha
 These two ships visited each island twice a month in the federation and provided an important maritime contact between the islands
 sangh ke samaapt hone ke liye kai kaarnon ko ginaya gaya he, unamem se kuch ko upar "samasya" anubhag main vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 This included lack of local public support, competitive insular nationalism, weakness of federal government, curb on federal taxation and freedom of movement, lack of federal constitution, fundamental changes to constitution at the beginning of its existence, political quarrels among influential leaders
 , The three most influential leaders decide not to participate in the federal election, the two largest units are Population and Resources The impact of heavy concentration, geographic and cultural distance between the units, lack of history of public administration and self-state period s who was standing by the Crown Colony system
 haalaanki, sangh ke vighatan ke liye tatkaal utprerak jamcon asantosh tha
 By 1961, Jamaica had a number of reasons for dissatisfaction with the state of affairs: jamaica ke asantusht hone kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaaran sangh kii aupniveshik sthiti kaa jari rahanaa tha
 Jamaica joined the Union because its leaders believed that the West Indies would soon be given independence
 sangh ke gathan ke lagbhag teen saal baad bhi aisa nahin hua tha, isi bich, chote british upnivesh jaise cyprus or siyara leone ne swatantraaa praapt kar lee thi
 Thus, many Jamaicans believed that the island should seek independence from its authority and this could happen
 saath hi sangh dwaara prastaavit rajdhani chaugaaramasa ke saath bhi samasyaayein thi, us samay vah sanyukt rajya ke haathon main tha 
 Many leaders of the Caribbean province wanted Chaguramas as the capital of the Confederacy
 kshetreey netaa jaise, jamaica ke norman manale or dow erik williams ne chaugaaramas ko sanyukt rajya se chhudaa kar sangh ko saunpe jane kii vakaalat kii
 However, the United States and Britain disagreed, and the Prime Minister of the Federation, Grantley Adams, refused provincial leaders to obtain Chaugaramas
 kai jamikans ko tab laga ki sangh unki vikaas prakriya or swatantraaa andolan ko baadhit kar rahaa he
 As a result, the Jamaican Labor Party, led by Bustamante, successfully forced Manley to hold a referendum in September 1961 over political isolation from the Union
 us samay ke prantiy pradhanmantri manale ke virodh ke baavjood, 54 pratishat vot ke saath ise paarit kar diya gaya
 Manley himself was defeated in the island elections of April 1962 and Bustamante became the first Prime Minister of independent Jamaica on 6 August 1962
 jamaica ke jane ke baad, puraane malbe se ek nayaa mahasang khadaa karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 For this, there was considerable reliance on Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, who said in the past that he wanted a "strong union"
 antigua ke pradhanmantri ware bird ne jawaab diya ki sangh main unka praant trinidad ke baraabar kaa hissedaar he, "ek chote se tobago" kii tarah nahi he
 He indicated that a strong federation was acceptable provided no attempt was made to create a unitary state
 is nae sangh par vaarta sitambar 1961 main shuru hui; haalaanki, unhone sanket diya ki trinidad ko 75 se 80 pratishat tak nae mahasang kaa rajasav pradaan karnaa hoga
 Furthermore, even though Trinidad now represents 60 percent of the new union's population, the resolution under consideration had to be given less than half the seats in Parliament
 november tak, williams ne sanket diya ki ab vah ek ekaatmak rajya banane ke vichaar ke paksh main he
 Failing that, he resolved to take independence to Trinidad and Tobago
 jiske tahat 4 disambar 1961 ko unhen ek trinidadian netaa ke rup punarnirvachan dwaara simit kiya gaya
 Later in December, Barbados Prime Minister Errol Barrow met with Williams, but failed to persuade him to keep Trinidad in the Union
 14 janvari,1962 ko naishanal pipuls movement ne sangh ke saath kisi bhi aage kii bhagidaari ko khaarij karne ke prastaav ko paarit kiya
 Williams himself stated that "if we remove one out of ten, only zero remains" In other words, without Jamaica, union was not possible
 trinidad or tobago ko 31 agast 1962 ko swatantraaa mili
 Without Trinidad and Jamaica, the remaining "little Eight" attempted to retain some form of West Indies union, this time focused on Barbados
 haalaanki, ye vaartaayen antat nirarthak sabit hui
 Without its two largest states, the Union was ruined by financial bankruptcy

 All three also remain British territories

 Two other campuses were established: one in Trinidad and Tobago, which was established in 1960 and the other in Barbados, which was established in 1963, shortly after the union dissolved

 All of these stamps had a common design with a map of the Caribbean and a depiction of Queen Elizabeth with "the West Indies / Federation 1958" written on top and the member's name at the bottom

 The slogan of Jai Hind given by him has become the national slogan of India
 "tum mujhe khun do main tumhe aazaadee duungaa" kaa naaraa bhi unka tha jo us samay atyadhik prachlan main aayaa
 Some historians believe that when Netaji tried to get help from Japan and Germany, the British government ordered his spies to end them in 1941

 While his martyrdom day is celebrated every year on August 18 in Japan, his family members living in India still believe that Subhash did not die in 1945

 If this is not the case, why has the Indian government not yet made documents related to his death public? 16 janvari 2014 ko kalakatta hai court ne netaji ke laapata hone ke rahasy se jude khufia dastavejon ko saarvajanik karne kii maang vaali janhit yachika par sunwaayee ke liye special bench ke gathan kaa aadesh diya

 After completing primary education from Protestant European School in Cuttack, in 1909, he joined Revensha Collegiate School
 college ke principal benimadhav das ke vyaktitv kaa subhash ke man par acha prabhaav padaa
 At the age of just fifteen, Subhash had done a full study of Vivekananda literature
 1915 main unhone intermediat kii pariksha biimaar hone ke baavjood dwitiya shrenee main uteern kii
 In 1916, when he was a BA student in Philosophy, there was a fight between the teachers and the students of the Presidency College on something that led to the leadership of the students, due to which he was expelled from the Presidency College for a year and also banned the examination

 khaali samay kaa upyog karne ke liye unhone terrytorial army kii pariksha di or fort wiliam senalay main rangarut ke rup main pravesh paa gayi
 Then it was thought that somewhere like BA Intermediate, Subhash studied very diligently and passed the BA examination in the first class in 1919
 kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main unka doosraa sthaan tha
 The father wished that Subhash should become ICS, but given his age, he had to pass this exam only once
 unhone pita se choubees ghante kaa samay yah sochane ke liye maanga taaki ve pariksha dene yaa na dene par koi antim nirnay le saken
 He kept awake all night wondering what to do
 aakhir unhone pariksha dene kaa faisla kiya or 15 sitambar 1919 ko england chale gayi
 Unable to get admission in any London school for exam preparation, Subhash somehow got admission for studying Tripas examination of mental and moral sciences in Kits William Hall
 isse unke rahane va khaane kii samasya hal ho gayi
 Recently, taking admission was an excuse to show the real purpose by passing in ICS
 so unhone 1920 main variyata suchi main chauthaa sthaan praapt karte hue paas kar lee
 After this, Subhash wrote a letter to his elder brother Sharat Chandra Bose and wanted to know his opinion that the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Arvind Ghosh have been captured on their hearts and minds, how can they become slaves of the British by becoming ICS? Wrote a letter of resignation from the ICS to the Secretary of India ES Montague on 22 April 1921

 Inspired by the work of the freedom fighter Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das of Kolkata, he wanted to work with Subhash Dasbabu
 england se unhone dasababu ko khat likhakar unke saath kaam karne kii ichha prakat kii
 According to the advice of Rabindranath Thakur, on his return to India, he first went to Mumbai and met Mahatma Gandhi

 unke saath subhash is aandolan main sahabhaagi ho gayi
 In 1922, Dasbabu founded the Swaraj Party under the Congress
 vidhansabha ke andar se angrez sarkaar kaa virodh karne ke liye kolkata mahapalika kaa chunaav swaraj party ne ladakar jeeta or dasababu kolkata ke mahayor ban gayi
 He made Subhash the chief executive officer of the municipality
 subhash ne apane kaarykaal main kolkata mahapalika kaa puraa dhaanchaa or kaam karne kaa tarika hi badal daalaa
 All the routes in Kolkata were changed to English names and given Indian names
 swatantrata sangram main praan nyochhavar karne waalon ke parivarajanon ko mahapalika main naukari milane lagi
 Very soon Subhash became an important youth leader of the country
 jawaharlal nehru ke saath subhash ne congress ke antargat yuvakon kii independence lig shuru kii
 When the Simon Commission came to India in 1928, the Congress showed it black flags
 kolkata main subhash ne is aandolan kaa netritv kiya
 To answer the Simon Commission, the Congress entrusted the task of framing the future Constitution of India to the eight-member Commission
 motilal nehru is ayog ke adhyaksh or subhash uske ek sadsy the
 This commission presented the Nehru Report
 1928 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan motilal nehru kii adhyakshata main kolkata main hua
 In this session, Subhash wearing a khaki uniform saluted Motilal Nehru in a military manner
 gandhi ji un dinon purna swarajya kii maang se sahamat nahin the
 In this session, he was determined to demand Dominion status from the British government
 lekin subhashbabu or jawaharlal nehru ko purna swaraj kii maang se peeche hatana manjuur nahin tha
 In the end, it was decided that the British government should be given one year to give Dominion status
 agar ek saal main angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii to congress purna swaraj kii maang karegi
 But the British government did not meet this demand
 isaliye 1930 main jab congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main lahore main hua tab aisa tay kiya gaya ki 26 janvari kaa din swatantrata diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa
 On 26 January 1931, Subhash was leading a huge front by hoisting the national flag in Kolkata when the police fired sticks on him and wounded him and sent him to jail
 jab subhash jail main the tab gandhi ji ne angrej sarkaar se samjhauta kiya or sab kaidiyon ko reeha karvaa diya
 But the British government refused to release revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh
 bhagat singh kii phaansi maaf karaane ke liye gandhi ji ne sarkaar se baat to kii parantu narmi ke saath
 Subhash wanted Gandhiji to break the agreement made with the British government on this subject
 lekin gandhiji apni ore se diya gaya vachan todane ko raji nahin the
 The British government stood firm in its place and Bhagat Singh and his associates were hanged
 bhagat singh ko na bachaa paane par subhash gandhi or congress ke tarikon se bahut naaraaz ho gayi
 Subhash was imprisoned a total of 11 times in his public life
 sabase pehle unhen 16 july 1921 main chah maheene kaa karawas hua
 In 1925, a revolutionary named Gopinath Saha wanted to kill Kolkata Superintendent of Police Charles Tegart
 usne galati se arnest de naamak ek vyapaaree ko maar daalaa
 For this he was hanged
 gopinath ko phaansi hone ke baad subhash foot foot kar roye
 He sought the dead body of Gopinath and performed his last rites
 isse angrez sarkaar ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki subhash jvalant krantikariyon se na keval sambandh hi rakhte hai apitu ve unhen utprerit bhi karte hai
 On the same pretext, the British government arrested Subhash and sent him imprisoned in Mandal prison in Myanmar indefinitely without any trial
 5 navambar 1925 ko deshbandhu chittaranjan das kolkata main chal based
 Subhash heard the news of his death on the radio at Mandalay jail
 mandle karagrih main rahete samay subhash kii tabiyat bahut kharaab ho gayi
 He developed tuberculosis
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne phir bhi unhen reeha karne se inkaar kar diya
 To release them, the government placed a condition that they go to Europe for treatment
 lekin sarkaar ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki ilaaj ke baad ve bharat kab laut sakate hai
 Hence Subhash did not accept this condition
 aakhir main paristhiti itani kathin ho gayi ki jail adhikariyon ko yah lagane laga ki shaayad ve karawas main hi na mar jaayen
 The British government did not even want to take the risk that Subhash died in prison
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 Subhash then went to Dalhousie for treatment
 1930 main subhash karawas main hi the ki chunaav main unhen kolkata kaa mahayor chunaa gaya
 Therefore, the government was forced to release him
 1932 main subhash ko phir se karawas hua
 This time he was kept in Almora jail
 almoda jail main unki tabiyat phir se kharaab ho gayi
 On the advice of doctors, Subhash agreed to go to Europe this time for treatment
 san 1933 se lekar 1936 tak subhash europe main rahe
 Subhash continued his work in Europe, taking care of his health
 vahaan ve italy ke netaa musolini se mili, jinhone unhen bharat ke swatantrata sangram main sahaayta karne kaa vachan diya
 De Valera, the leader of Ireland, became a good friend of Subhash
 jin dinon subhash europe main the unheen dinon jawaharlal nehru kii patni kamala nehru kaa austria main nidhan ho gaya
 Subhash went there and consoled Jawaharlal Nehru
 baad main subhash europe main vitthal bhai patel se mili
 Subhash along with Vitthalbhai Patel held the mantra which came to be known as patel-bose analysis
 is vishleshan main un donon ne gandhi ke netritv kii jamkar ninda kii
 Subsequently, when Vitthal Bhai Patel became ill, Subhash served him a lot
 magar vitthal bhai patel nahin bache, unka nidhan ho gaya
 In his will, Vitthal Bhai Patel gave all his property to Subhash
 magar unke nidhan ke pashchaat unke bhai sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne is vasiyat ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Sardar Patel prosecuted this will in court
 yah mukadmaa jeetne par sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne apane bhai kii sari sampatti gandhi ke harijan seva kaary ko bhent kar di
 In 1934, Subhash received the news of his father's death
 khabar sunate hi ve hawaii jahaaj se karachi hote hue kolkata laute
 Even though he had come to know in Karachi that his father had died, he still went to Kolkata
 kolkata pahonchte hi angrej sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar kar liya or kai din jail main rakhkar waapas europe bhej diya
 In 1934, when Subhash was staying in Austria for his treatment, he needed an English-knowing typist to write his book
 unke ek mitra ne emily shenkal naam kii ek austrian mahila se unki mulaakaat kara di
 Emily's father was a famous vet
 subhash emily kii ore aakarshith hue or un donon main swaabhaavik prem ho gaya
 In view of the strict laws of Nazi Germany, both of them got married in 1942 by Hindu method at a place called Bad Gastein
 viena main emily ne ek putree ko janm diya
 Subhash first saw her when she was barely four weeks old
 unhone uskaa naam anita bose rakhaa tha
 When Subhash died in an alleged plane crash in Taiwan in August 1945, Anita Paune was three years old
 anita abhi jivit he
 Her name is Anita Bose Faf
 apane pita ke parivaar janon se milane anita phalf kabhi-kabhi bharat bhi aati he
 In 1938, the annual session of the Congress was scheduled to be held in Haripura
 is adhiveshan se pehle gandhi ji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa
 This was the 51st session of the Congress
 isliye congress adhyaksh subhash chandra bose kaa swaagat 51 belon dwaara khinche hue rath main kiya gaya
 Subhash's presidential speech was very effective in this session
 kisi bhi bhartiya raajnneetik vyakti ne shaayad hi itnaa prabhavi bhaashan kabhi diya ho
 During his presidential tenure, Subhash established the Planning Commission
 jawaharlal nehru iske pehle adhyaksh banaaye gayi
 Subhash also established a Science Council in Bangalore under the chairmanship of the famous scientist Sir Visvesvaraya
 1937 main japan ne china par akraman kar diya
 Under the chairmanship of Subhash, the Congress decided to send a medical team under the leadership of Dr
 Dwarkanath Kotnis to assist the Chinese people
 aage chalakar jab subhash ne bharat ke swatantrata sangram main japan se sahyog kiya tab kai log unhe japan kii kathputli or phacist kehane lage
 But this incident proves that Subhash was neither a puppet of Japan nor did he agree with the fascist ideology
 1938 main gandhiji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa to tha magar unhen subhash kii kaarypaddati pasand nahin aayi
 Meanwhile, the Second World War was clouded in Europe
 subhash chaahate the ki england kii is kathinaayee kaa laabh uthaakar bharat kaa swatantrata sangram adhik teevr kiya jaye
 He had also started taking steps in this direction during his presidential tenure but Gandhiji did not agree with this
 1939 main jab nayaa congress adhyaksh chunane kaa vakt aayaa tab subhash chaahate the ki koi aisa vyakti adhyaksh banaaya jaye jo is maamle main kisi dabaav ke aage bilkul na jhuke
 since no one is volunteering so, subhash decided to be Congrees President
 lekin gandhi unhen adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chaahate the
 Gandhi chose Pattabhi Sitaramaiya for the post of president
 kaviver rabindranath thakur ne gandhi ko khat likhakar subhash ko hi adhyaksh banane kii vinati kii
 Scientists like Prafulla Chandra Rai and Meghnad Saha also wanted to see Subhash as the president again
 lekin gandhiji ne is maamle main kisi kii baat nahin maani
 Years later, on finding a deal in Congress was elected to the presidency
 sab samajhate the ki jab mahatma gandhi ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kaa saath diya hai tab ve chunaav aasaani se jeet jaayenge
 But in reality, Subhash got 1580 votes and Sitaramayya got 1377 votes in the election
 gandhiji ke virodh ke baavjood subhashbabu 203 maton se chunaav jeet gayi
 But with the result of the election, the matter did not end
 gandhiji ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kii haar ko apni haar bataakar apane saathiyon se kah diya ki agar wein subhash ke tareekon se sahamat nahin hai to wein congress se hat sakaten hai
 After this, 12 of the 14 members of the Congress executive resigned
 jawaharlal nehru tatasth bane rahe or akele sharadbabu subhash ke saath rahe
 The annual Congress session of 1939 took place in Tripuri
 is adhiveshan ke samay subhashbabu tej bukhaar se itane biimaar ho gayi the ki unhen strechar par litaakar adhiveshan main laana padaa
 Gandhiji himself was not present in this session and his colleagues also did not give any support to Subhash
 adhiveshan ke baad subhash ne samjhaute ke liye bahut koshish kii lekin gandhiji or unke saathiyon ne unki ek na maani
 The situation became such that Subhash could not do anything
 aakhir main tang aakar 29 april 1939 ko subhash ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 On 3 May 1939, Subhash established his own party within the Congress in the name of Forward Bloc
 kuch din baad subhash ko congress se hi nikaal diya gaya
 Later, the Forward Bloc became an independent party on its own
 dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru hone se pehle se hi forward block ne swatantrata sangram ko or adhik teevr karne ke liye jan jagriti shuru kii
 On 3 September 1939, Subhash was reported to be fighting a war in Britain and Germany in Madras
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ab bharat ke paas sunaharaa mauka he use apni mukti ke liye abhiyaan tej kar dena chahiye
 On 8 September 1939, Subhash was called to the Congress Working Committee as a special invitee to decide the party's stance towards the war
 unhone apni raay ke saath yah sankalp bhi doharaaya ki agar congress yah kaam nahin kar sakati he to forward block apane dam par british raaj ke khilaaf yuddh shuru kar degaa
 The following year in July, the Halwet Pillar at Calcutta, which was a symbol of India's slavery, was submerged overnight by Subhash's youth brigade
 subhash ke swayamsevak uski neenv kii ek-ek eent ukhaad le gayi
 This was a symbolic beginning
 iske madhyam se subhash ne yah sandesh diya tha ki jaise unhone yah stambh dhul main mila diya he usee tarah ve british samrajya kii bhi eent se eent baja denge
 As a result, the British government imprisoned all the main leaders of the forward block, including Subhash
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan subhash jail main niskriy rahanaa nahin chaahate the
 Subhash started a fast in jail to force the government to release him
 haalat kharaab hote hi sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 But the British government also did not want Subhash to be free during the war
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen unke hi ghar par najarband karke baahar police kaa kadaa paharaa bitha diya
 Subhash made a plan to get out of detention
 16 janvari 1941 ko ve police ko chakma dete hue ek pathan mohammad jiauddin ke vesh main apane ghar se nikle
 Sharadbabu's elder son Shishir took him away from Kolkata to Gomoh in his car
 gomoh railway stesan se frontier mail pakadakar ve peshawar pahunche
 In Peshawar he found Mian Akbar Shah, a co-operative of the Forward Bloc
 miyaan akbar shah ne unki mulaakaat, keerti kisaan party ke bhagatraam talwaar se kara di
 With Bhagatram Talwar, Subhash set out from Peshawar towards Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan
 is safar main bhagatraam talwaar rahamat khan naam ke pathan or subhash unke guunge-bahere chachaa bane the
 He completed this journey by walking in the hills
 kabul main subhash do maheenon tak uttamchand malhotra naamak ek bhartiya vyapaaree ke ghar main rahe
 There he first wanted to enter the Russian Embassy
 isamen naakaamayaab rahane par unhone german or italian duutavaason main pravesh paane kii koshish kii
 His attempt at the Italian Embassy was a success
 german or italian duutavaason ne unki sahaayta kii
 Finally, after becoming an Italian man named Arlando Mazzonta, Subhash left Kabul and reached Berlin, the capital of Germany via Moscow, the capital of Russia
 berlin main subhash sarvapratham riben trope jaise germany ke anya netaaon se mili
 He founded the Indian Freedom Organization and Azad Hind Radio in Germany
 isi dauraan subhash netaji ke naam se jane jane lage
 Adam Fon Trott, a minister in the German government, became a good friend of Subhash
 aakhir 29 may 1942 ke din, subhash germany ke sarvocch netaa adolf hitler se mili
 But Hitler was not particularly interested in India
 unhone subhash ko sahaayta kaa koi spasht vachan nahin diya
 Many years ago Hitler wrote the autobiography named Mayan Kampf
 is kitaab main unhone bharat or bhartiya logon kii buraai kii thi
 Subhash expressed his displeasure with Hitler on this subject
 hitler ne apane kiye par maafee maangi or min kamff ke agle sanskaran main vah pariched nikaalane kaa vachan diya
 At last, Subhash came to know that he will not get anything from Hitler and Germany
 isaliye 8 march 1943 ko germany ke keel bandargah main ve apane saathi aabid hasan safrani ke saath ek german pandubbi main baithkar purvi asia kii ore nikal gayi
 The German submarine took her to the shores of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean
 vahaan ve donon samudr main tairkar japani pandubbi tak pahunche
 At the time of World War II, it was the only interchange of civilians by the submarines of the navies of any two countries
 yah japani pandubbi unhen indonesia ke padang bandargah tak pahunchaakar aayi
 Arriving in East Asia, Subhash first took the leadership of the Indian Council of Independence from veteran revolutionary Rasbihari Bose
 singapore ke edward park main rasbihari ne swechha se swatantrata parishad kaa netritv subhash ko saunpa tha
 Japan's Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo, impressed by Netaji's personality, assured him to cooperate
 kai din pashchaat netaji ne japan kii sansad ke saamne bhaashan diya
 On 21 October 1943, Netaji established the arzi-hukumate-azad-hind in Singapore
 ve khud is sarkaar ke raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or yumantri bane
 a total of nine countries recognized this government
 netaji azaad hind fouj ke pradhan senapati bhi ban gayi
 In the Azad Hind Fauj, the Japanese army recruited Indian prisoners of war holding the British
 azaad hind fuj main auraton ke liye jhansi kii rani regiment bhi banaayi gayi
 In East Asia, Netaji gave several speeches and appealed to the permanent Indian people to join the free Indian army and provide financial help
 unhone apane aavahan main yah sandesh bhi diya - "tum mujhe khun do, main tumhen azaadi doongaa
 " dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan azaad hind fouj ne japani sena ke sahyog se bharat par akraman kiya
 To inspire his army, Netaji gave the slogan "delhi Chalo"
 donon phujon ne angrejon se andaman or nicobar dweep jeet liye
 This island remained under the discipline of arji-hukumte-azad-hind
 netaji ne in dwipon ko "shahid dweep" or "swaraj dweep" kaa nayaa naam diya
 The two forces jointly attacked Imphal and Kohima
 lekin baad main angrejon kaa palada baari padaa or donon phujon ko peeche hatana padaa
 When the Azad Hind Fauj was retreating, the Japanese army arranged for Netaji to flee
 parantu netaji ne jhansi kii rani regiment kii ladakiyon ke saath saikadon mile chalate rahanaa pasand kiya
 Thus Netaji presented a model of true leadership
 6 july 1944 ko azaad hind radio par apane bhaashan ke madhyam se gandhiji ko sambodhit karte hue netaji ne japan se sahaayta lene kaa apana kaaran or arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind tathaa azaad hind fouj kii sthapana ke uddeshy ke bare main bataaya
 During this speech, Netaji called Gandhiji the Father of the Nation, only then Gandhiji also called him Netaji
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main japan kii haar ke baad, netaji ko nayaa rasta dhoondhna jaruri tha
 He decided to ask Russia for help
 18 agast 1945 ko netaji hawaii jahaaj se manchuriya kii taraf ja rahe the
 He went missing during this journey
 is din ke baad ve kabhi kisi ko dikhaayi nahin diye
 On August 23, 1945, Tokyo Radio reported that Netaji was coming from a large bomber aircraft in Saigon that his plane crashed near Taihoku Airport on August 18
 vimaan main unke saath savaar japani general shodei, pilet tathaa kuch anya log maare gayi
 Netaji was severely burnt
 unhen taihoku sainik aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan unhone dam tod diya
 According to Colonel Habiburrahman, his last rites were performed in Taihoku
 sitambar ke madhya main unki asthiyaan sanchit karke japan kii rajdhani tokio ke rankoji mandir main rakh di gayin
 According to a document received from the National Archives of India, Netaji died on August 18, 1945 at 21
00 at the military hospital in Taihoku
 swatantrata ke pashchaat bharat sarkaar ne is ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye 1956 or 1977 main do baar ayog niyukt kiya
 Both times it was found that Netaji was killed in that plane crash
 lekin jis taiwan kii bhoomi par yah durghatana hone kii khabar thi us taiwan desh kii sarkaar se in donon aayogon ne koi baat hi nahin kii
 In 1999, a third commission was formed under the leadership of Manoj Kumar Mukherjee
 2005 main taiwan sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog ko bataa diya ki 1945 main taiwan kii bhoomi par koi hawaii jahaaj durghatnagrast hua hi nahin tha
 In 2005, the Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to the Government of India, stating that there was no evidence of Netaji's death in that plane crash
 lekin bharat sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog kii report ko asweekaar kar diya
 Where Netaji went missing on 18 August 1945 and what happened next has become the biggest unanswered mystery in Indian history
 desh ke alag-alag hisson main aaj bhi netaji ko dekhne or milane kaa daawa karne vaale logon kii kami nahin he
 Many claims have been made about the existence of Netaji from Gumnami Baba of Faizabad to District Raigad in Chhattisgarh state, but the authenticity of all these is doubtful
 chhattisgarh main to subhash chandra bose ke hone kaa maamla rajya sarkaar tak gaya
 But the state government closed the file of the case, considering it not worthy of intervention

 All references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed after the demolition
 aatmasamarpan ke uparant japan chaar-paanch varshon tak america ke paanvon tale karahata rahaa
 This was the reason that the thrilling history of Netaji and Azad Hind Sena kept gathering dust in the archives of Tokyo for years

 Despite the lawful propaganda by the British and Subhash's opposition by the then major political parties, after that lawsuit that shook the whole country, the mothers began to take pride in naming their sons 'subhash'
 ghar–ghar main rana pratap or chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke jod par netaji kaa chitra bhi dikhaai dene laga
 Netaji's attempt to liberate India from the clutches of the British through the Azad Hind Fauj was not directly successful but had far-reaching consequences
 san 1946 ke nausena vidroh iskaa udhaaharan he
 It was only after the naval revolt that Britain was convinced that the Indian Army could no longer rule in India and they had no other option but to free India

 While the foreign rulers were afraid of Netaji's power before independence, after independence, the native rulers were terrified by the indelible influence of his personality and compassion on the masses

 In addition to his incomplete autobiography, An Indian Traveler, he also wrote an entire book in two volumes, India's Struggle, which was first published from London
 yah pustak kaaphi prasiddh hui thi
 Although his autobiography remained incomplete, he had a desire to complete it, which is evident from the plan made on the first page of the original manuscript
 iske atirikt netaji ne apane bahuaiami swatantraaa sangharsh ke sandarbh main aganit patr likhe, bhaashan diye evam radio ke madhyam se bhi unke vyaakhyaan prasaarit hue

 The initial plan was to publish 'samagra Sahitya' in 10 volumes, but later the scheme was reduced to 12 sections
 april 1980 main sarvapratham bangla main iske pratham khand kaa prakaashan hua tha or november 1980 main angreji main
 Its first volume in Hindi was published in 1982 and then overall literature in these three languages continued to be published
 iskaa antim khand 2011 i0 main chap kar aa paaya; haalanki isaki saamagree pehle se hi taiyaar thi
 Sugat Bose was also associated with the compilation and publication work of this 'samagra Vaamay' and the last two volumes were published mainly due to the sad demise of Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose in the editing of Sugat Bose itself
 is 'samgr vaanmay' ke pratham khand main unki 'aatmakatha' ke saath kuch patron kaa prakaashan hua he or dwitiya khand main unki suprasiddh pustak 'bharat kaa sangharsh' kaa prakaashan hua he
 Then in other sections, there is a systematic publication of the entire available literature, such as letters written by him, comments and speeches

 aap yah bhi na sonche ki yah aapke samaj main nahin aayegaa| main computer par kaam to karata hum par computer vaigyanik nahin hum, na hi mujhe computer ke bare main koi jaankaree he

 If there is no money for the software, then how will it work? The merchant class then felt that free software was useless and they kept it far away from them
 haalanki free software se bhi paisa kamaaya ja saktaa he lekin uskaa tarika kuch alag he, parantu free software par kuch aisa thappa lag gaya ki vyapaaree varg un duusare tareekon ko bhi apnaane se dur rahane lage
 In 1997, enthusiasts in free software held a meeting in San Francisco and formed a public corporation called Open Source Initiative
 isamen 10 maarg darshak siddhant banaaye gayi

 Operating system is software which brings the hardware of a computer and runs a computer
 There are mainly three types of operating systems

 FOSS / FLOSS: free software, open sorce software he par har open sorce software, free software nahin he
 GPL for free software Must be published under license, but open source software can also be published under many other types of licenses
 donon main antar to he par sambandh bhi gaharaa he
 All this has started with free software, so such software is called Free Open Source Software or FOSS for short

 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest will not be excluded from its development
 


so open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It’s still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people's rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that does not mandate legal protection for such secrecy

 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance

 Some extreme versions of goldfish live in aquariums "- they are less robust than wild varieties
 haalanki, kuch kismein adhik majboot hoti hai jaise shubankin 
 mukhya kismein hai: Chinese tradition classifies goldfish mainly into 4 types
 yah vargeekaran saamanytah pashchim main istemaal nahin kiya jaataa
 Goldfish are popular pond fishes, as they are small, cheap, colorful and very adventurous
 ek bahari talab yaa jal bagiche main, sataha par barf jam jane par bhi sambhawatah ve sankshipt avadhi ke liye bhi jivit rahe, jab tak jal oxigenparyaapt maatr main maujuud hoti he or talab puri tarah se jam nahin jaataa

 Moor, velatel, oranda and lionhead can be protected in outdoor ponds only in summer and in more tropical climates
 chote se lekar bade talabon tak sabhi iske liye thik he, haalanki gaharaai kam se kam saanchaa:cm to in hona chahie taaki thand se jamane se bachaa rahe
 sardiyon ke dauraan, sunaharimachhlee sust ho jaati hai, khaanaa band kar detii he or aksar talab ke tal par rahati hai
 This is completely normal; And they reactivate in the spring
 talab ko saafe rakhane or apshisht ko saafe karne ke liye ek filter mahatvapurn hota he
 Plants are essential because they act as part of the filtration system as well as a food source for fish
 paudhe aage or laabhakaari he kyonki ve pani main oxigen kaa str badhaate hai
 Consistent fishes include, rood tench, orphe and koi but the latter require special care
 ramshorn ghongha talab main ugane vaale shaiwal ko kha kar madadgaar sabit hote hai
 Without any type of animal population control, the number of goldfish can easily become very dense in ponds
 orfe jaisi machhliiyaan sunaharimachhlee ke andey kha jaati hai
 Any one can interbreed with a goldfish, so that the fish produced can be sterile hybrid fish
 adhiktar carp kii tarah, sunaharimachhlee bhi bahut bade paimaane par apshisht utpaadit karti hai mel or galgada donon hi ke madhyam se, jo jal main hanikaarak rasayanachhodte hai
 The accumulation of this waste even for short periods of time can reach toxic levels and can easily lead to the death of a goldfish
 aam or comet kismon ke liye, prayek sunaharimachhlee ke liye 20 america galen pani hona chahie
 sajaavati sunaharimachhlee ke liye 10 america galen pani hona chahie
 pani kaa sataha kshetra yah nirdhaarit karata he ki pani main kitna oxigen vyaapt he or ghul gaya he
 As a general rule, there should be 1 square foot
 Aeration by water pump filters or fountains minimizes the minimum surface area
 sunaharimachhlee ek thande pani kii machhlee ke rup main vargeekrut kii jaati he or ek bina garm kiye equari main rah sakati he, ek aise taapmaana main jo manushyon ke liye paryaapt he
 However, rapid changes in temperature can kill them, especially if the tank is small

 The optimum temperature for goldfish is 20 ° C
 And 22 ° c Is between sabhi machhleeyon kii tarah, sunaharimachhlee ko bhi paaltu bananaa pasand nahin he
 In fact, touching a goldfish can endanger its health, as it can damage or remove the protective thin membranes on them, resulting in fish skin infection from bacteria or exposure to water-born parasites
 It happens
 haalanki, sunaharimachhlee khaane ke samay sth par aakar manushya ke prati pratikriya karti he or use manushya kii ungaliyon se goliyaan yaa sookshm tukdaa lene ke liye prashikshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Poor care has been blamed for the early death of goldfish
 kaid main sunaharimachhlee kaa jivan chakra 10 varsh se adhik vistrut ho saktaa he
 If left in the dark for a period, the goldfish gradually changes its color until it turns completely gray
 Goldfish produce pigment in response to sunlight, in the same way that human skin becomes sunburnt
 machhleeyon main chromataforess naamak koshikaayen hoti hai jo prakaash ko pratibimbit karne vaale rangadravya utpaadit karti he or machhlee ko uskaa rang pradaan karti he
 The color of a goldfish is determined by which pigments are in its cells, how many pigment molecules are present there, and whether the pigment is within the cell group or is spread throughout the cytoplasm
 junglee parivesh main, unke aahaar main kathini jeev, keet or vibhinn paudh aahaar shaamil he
 They are omnivores and can perform well with a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables in place of a staple layer or pill supplement
 adhiktar anya machhleeyon kii tarah, sunaharimachhlee bhi ek avasarwaadi khaane vaali he or apane mat anusaar khaanaa nahin chhod chhodti

 Feed the goldfish the same amount of food as it can finish in three to four minutes and that too no more than twice a day
 Excess feeding can prove fatal, especially by blocking or tearing the intestines
 This is often the case with a select breed of goldfish, whose intestines are curved
 ve machhlee paalak jinke paas nai rayukin, fantel, oranda, linhed yaa anya sajaavati sunaharimchaliyaan hai unhen saavdhaanee purvak yah tay karnaa hoga ki unki aavashyaktaa kitni he
 In a special diet of goldfish, the amount of protein in comparison to the common fish diet is low and the amount of carbohydrate is high
 yah do roopon main milti he - chapate sookshm aahaar jo pani par tairte hai or goliyaan jo dub jaati hai
 Enthusiasts can use peeled peas, colored green leafy vegetables and bloodworms in place of this diet
 yuva sunaharimachhlee apane aahaar namakeen chinraat milaae jane se labhanvit hoti hai
 As with all animals, the choice of goldfish also varies
 sajaavati sunaharimchaliyaan apane pankhons ke gahare rangon ke kaaran junglee vaataavaran main jivit nahin rah sakati hai; haalanki shubankin jaise saahsee kismon kii machhliyaan kaaphi lambey samay tak jivit rah sakati or apane junglee sambandhiyon ke saath prajnan karti hai
 Mango and comet goldfish can not only survive in any season suitable for a pond, but also thrive
 junglee sunaharimachhlee kaa parichay vahaan rahane vaale prajatiyon ke liye samasyaayein paidaa kar saktaa he
 Within three generations of breeding, the eggfish of the goldfish reverts to their natural olive-like green color
 sunaharimchaliyaan, carp ke kuch anya prajatiyon ke saath sankaran kar sakati hai
 There are some distinct differences indicating that Prussian carp, despite being descended from goldfish, have so much difference or isolation that they can be considered two different species
 vyavhaar do kaarnon se vyapak rup se bhinn ho sakati he, kyonki sunaharimachhlee bhinn vaataavaranon main rahati he or isliye bhi kyonki unka vyavhaar unke maalikon dwaara anukulit kiya ja saktaa he
 The ability to learn companionship and social skills is strong in goldfish
 iske alaava, unki drushti tikshnata unhen insaanon ke bich fark pahchaanane main madad karata he
 The owners of the fish must have noted that the fish react favorably to them while they go hidden when other people go to the tank
 samay ke saath, sunaharimachhlee swayan ko apane maalik or anya logon ke saath bhojan ke sambandh main jodna sikh jaati hai or jab bhi unke maalik paas aate hai ve bhojan ke liye "bheekh maangane" lagati hai
 The response of a blind goldfish proved that he recognized a particular member of the family and a friend by his voice or sound vibration
 yah vyavhaar ullekhneey tha, kyonki isse yah pataa chalaa ki machhlee ne keval ghar ke saat sadasyon main se vishesh rup se keval do sadasyon ke dhwani tarangon ko pahachaanaa
 Goldfish are gregarious, exhibiting schooling behavior as well as the same type of dietary behavior
 sunaharimachhlee darpan main apni chhavi dekh kar bhi isi prakaar pratikriya kaa pradarshan karti he
 Goldfish, who have constant visual contact with humans, also stop considering themselves as a threat
 ek tanks main kai hafton tak kabhi-kabhi maheenon tak, rakhe jane ke baad, ek sunaharimachhlee ko bina uske sharma kar dur gaye, haathon se khilaanaa sambhav hota he
 Goldfish have learned behavior as both groups and individuals, which originated from the behavior of local carp
 ve kisi bhi paristhiti main jivit rahane vaali prajati he, jinke vibhinn khaadya, prajnan or shikari parihaar vyavhaar ne unki safalataa main yogadan kiya
 As fish they can be described as "friendly" to each other
 kadaachit hi ek sunaharimachhlee duusari sunaharimachhlee ko nuksaan pahunchati hai or naa hi kabhi nar machhlee prajnan ke samay maadaa machhlee ko nuksaan pahunchaati he
 The only real danger that goldfish carry to each other is competition for food
 During the feeding process, mango, comet and other fast varieties quickly eat all the food before the ornamental varieties reach it
 This can lead to more ornamental varieties of stunted growth and starvation when they are kept in the same pond with their single-tailed brothers
 parinaam swaroop, is baat kaa khyaal rakhaa janaa chahie ki keval ek hi tarah ki shaareerik banaavat or tairne kii visheshta vaali naslon ko hi saath main rakhaa jaae
 Goldfish can be trained to recognize and react to light signals of different colors using positive reinforcement
 sunaharimachhlee kii smriti avadhi kam se kam teen maah kii hoti he or yah alag alag aakaaron, rangon or awaajon ke bich antar kr sakate hai
 Another experiment demonstrated retention of recall for a period longer than 1 month
 machhliiyaan bhojan se sambandhit kuch rangon ke prati pratikriya karti he
 Fish learn to forecast the timing of a meal provided that the food is given at about the same time every day
 When taught using training techniques with positive reinforcement, goldfish learn some tricks, such as limbo, slalom, fetch, and sleep
 sunaharimchaliyaan talab main or anya dhimi yaa tehre hue pani ke nikaayon main nivas karti hai, jahaan pani kii gaharaai 20 meter ho

 They can also survive temperatures of 40–106 ° F, although at high temperatures they can only survive for a brief time
 ve ek garm ushnkaribandheey machhlee tanks main rahane ke liye anukulit nahin hai or ve bina garm kiye hue tinkon main oxigen ke sankendran ko tarjeeh dete hai, kuch kaa maananaa he ki garmi unhen jala detii he
 However, goldfish can live in outdoor ponds with temperatures often reaching above 86 ° F
 jal ke taapmaana main akasmaat parivartan kisi bhi machhlee ke liye jisamen sunaharimachhlee bhi shaamil he, hanikaarak sabit ho saktaa he
 When transferring a purchased goldfish from a shop to a pond or tank, the transport container should be kept in the destination container for at least 20 minutes to equalize their temperature before releasing the goldfish
 If there is more difference in temperature change, such as room temperature 21 ° C
 From a cold garden pond 4 ° C
 In, then the infection should be extended for days or weeks
 kyonki sunaharimchaliyaan jivit paudhe khaati hai, isliye ek paudh ropit equarium main unki upasthiti samasyagrast ho sakati he
 Only a few aquarium plant species, for example Chryptocyrin and Anubias, can survive around the goldfish, but special attention is needed to ensure that they are not uprooted
 Plastic plants are often more durable, but their branches can irritate or damage fish when they touch them
 sunaharimchaliyaan yon paripakvata ko keval paryaapt pani or sahi poshan ke saath hi viksit kar sakati hai
 Most goldfish breed in captivity, especially in the pond system
 When kept well, they can breed indoors, but not in a small fish cage
 Breeding usually occurs in the spring, often after a significant change in temperature

 Egg-popping babies are so large that they are described as "an eyelid with two pupils"
 Within a week or so, the fry begins to take their final shape, although it may take more than a year for them to develop a ripe goldfish-like color; Till then they remain metallic brown like their wild ancestors
 apane jivan ke pehle saptaah main, frai jaldi viksit hota he-yah us ucch jokhim kaa anukulan he jiske tahat unke vaataavaran main rahane vaale vayask machhlee dwaara unhen nigal liya jaataa he
 Some highly bred goldfish can no longer breed naturally due to their changed shape
 An artificial breeding method called "hand stripping" in English is helpful to nature, but can damage fish if not done properly
 guppi jaisi, kuch anya aam equarium machhliyon, kii tarah sunaharimachhlee or anya carp machhliyon ko, machharon kii aabaadi ko kam karne ke liye tehre hue pani ke nikaayon main aksar daalaa jaataa he
 They are used to stop the West Nile Virus, which depends on mosquito displacement
 haalanki, sunaharimchhaliyon kaa parichay karana praayah hi sthaneey paristhitiki tantra ke liye nakaaratmak parinaam laati he
 Some countries have banned the sale of traditional fish feeds under the Animal Welfare Act, due to the problem of stunting, deoxygenation and ammonia / nitrate poisoning of small environments
 bade paimaane par oxigen kii aavashyaktaa or ucch apshisht utpaadan ke kaaran, aise prapaton ko ab sunaharimachhlee ko sakhane ke liye upyukt nahin mana jaataa he
