 The fauna of the forest house is responsible for 75% of the total gross primary product of the system and 80% of the earth's vegetation is found in the forests
 Forests at different heights form different ecosystems
 Such as the boreal forest near the poles, tropical forest near the equator and temperate forest at moderate heights
 The height of an area and the moisture present there affect the trees found in that area
 Humans and forests have both positive and negative effects on each other
 Forests provide resources to humans and also provide sources of earning
 Forests also affect the health of humans
 While there is a negative impact on the forest due to human intervention

 Successful tragedy evokes feelings of compassion and tragedy through ecstasy, harmonizing them and thus presenting Anand's role
 virechan se bhavatmak vishranti hi nahin hoti, bhavatmak parishkar bhi hota he
 In this way, Aristotle has proved art and poetry to be admirable, gracious and effortless
 arastu ne is siddhant ke dwaara kala or kavy kii mahatta ko punarpratishthit karne kaa safal prayaas kiya
 Aristotle's master Plato recommended that poets and artists be kept outside their ideal state
 unka maananaa tha ki kavy hamaari vaasanaon ko poshit karne or bhadakaane main sahaayak he isliye nindaneey or tyajya he
 Religious and high moral literature is an exception, but most of the literature does not fall under this ideal category
 virechan siddhanth kaa mahatva bahuvidh he
 The first is that he resolved the attack on Plato by poetry and secondly that he must have influenced the poetic thinking of the past in some form or the other
 'virechan' unani katharsis kaa hindi roopaantar he
 The definition of Greek medical science is 'catharsis' and the term of Indian medicine is 'virechan'
 iskaa arth he- rochak aushadhi ke dwaara shaareerik vikaron arthath udar ke vikaron kii shuddhi
 Just as the removal and purification of bodily feces is necessary for health, similarly the removal and purification of mental feces like jealousy, malice, greed, attachment and anger is necessary
 arestu ne ‘catharsis’ shabd kaa lakshanik prayog maanav-man par padanevaali traasadee ke prabhaav kaa udghaatan karne ke liye kiya he
 Plato's objection to the tragedy was - "instead of suppressing human desires, they nourish and nourish them
" vah ucchtar tattvon ke badale nimnatar tattvon ko ubharkar aatma main araajaktaa utpann karti he
 '' arestu ne catharsis siddhanth dwaara plato ke is akshep kaa khandanakar traasadee kii upadeyata sthapit kii
 Aristotle presented the same as a virtue to Plato who had proved the fault
 arestu kaa abhimath he- That is, tragedy is the name of a copy of a work involving a serious self-fulfilling and certain dimension
 


 jiske karunaa traas se udrek dwaara in manovikaron kaa uchit vivechan kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, tragedy does not only incite undesirable feelings, but expels human real-life compassion and feelings of tragedy through the artificial evocation of compassion and tragedy
 virechan kaa ullekh arestu kii rachanaaon main keval do sthanon par miltaa he
 The first is mentioned in his 'poetics' treatise, where the nature of Tragedy is indicated and the second in the book 'political' where he has demonstrated the usefulness of music
 in sthalon par unhone virechan shabd kaa sutara rup main evam uske swaroop kii charchaa kii he
 Aristotle says - "music should be studied not for one, but for the accomplishment of many purposes, that is, for instruction in education
" sangeet se bauddhik anand kii bhi uplabdhi hoti he
 xxrep 5 
 They become silent due to the influence of religious ragas, as if their charge is quenched and purgated
 is prakaar virechan se abhipraay shuddhi se he
 These ideas of Aristotle are found in retail form in the context of tragedy-deliberation
 vishesh suvyavasthitrup se inkaa sampaadan nahin kiya gaya he
 In the modern era, Aristotle's limited and meager words have taken the form of a complete poetic-classical theory
 atah ek prashn swaabhaavikrup se uthaa ki karunaa or traas ke udrek tathaa rechan se arestu kaa multah kya abhipraay tha? is sandarbh main arestu ke parvarti vyakhyakaaron ne virechan ke bhinn-bhinn arth or vyakhyaayein prastut kin- Among the Aristotle interpreters, Prof
 Gilbert Murray and Livy have presented a theological interpretation of the phrase
 dharmaparak arth kii ek vishesh prishthbhumi he
 It is related to religious festivals
 pro gilbert mare kaa kathan he ki - ‘‘yunaan main dionusus naamak devtaa se sambaddh utsav apane aap main ek prakaar kii shuddhi kaa pratik tha, jisamen vigat samay ke kalush or paap evam mrityu-sansargon se mukti mil jaati he
 Thus, this remedy of peace of internal disorders by external disorders was quite prevalent in religious institutions during Aristotle's time
 unhone iskaa lakshanik prayog usee ke aadhaar par kiya he or virechan kaa arth hua- ‘‘bahya uttejnaa or ant main uske shaman dwaara atmik shuddhi or shaanti
 '' barnej naamak german vidwaan ne virechan kii nitiparak vyakhya kii he
 According to him, the human mind is beset by many psychics
 jinamein karun or bhay, multah dukhad manoveg hai
 Tragedy overpowers the theater by unrealistic circumstances by exaggerating them with artificial ambiguous measures, resolving the nation of these emotions in the observer's mind as lust and consequently establishing mental harmony
 atah virechan kaa nitiparak arth hua - manovikaron ke uttejan ke uparant udvaig kaa shaman or tajjanya maansik vishadta
 Current psychology and psychoanalytic scriptures also confirm this meaning
 maansik swasthya kii sadhak hone ke kaaran yah paddati naitik maani gai he
 In Goethe and English poetical critics there are hints of the artistic meaning of the phrase
 arestu ke prasiddh vyakhyaakaar pro bujar kaa abhimath he ki virechan keval manovigyaan athwa nidaanshastra ke ek tathy vishesh kaa vaachak na hokar, ek kala-siddhanth kaa abhivyanjak he
 Thus, the duty of tragedy is not only to present a medium of expression for compassion or tragedy, but to provide them with a certain artistic satisfaction
 inako kala ke madhyam main dhalkar parishkrut or spasht karnaa he
 The meaning of purgation is broad here - mental balance is just the former part of it, the culmination of its artistic gratification without which the circle of artistic taste of tragedy is not complete
 prashn uthta he ki uparyukt teenon arthon main se koun sa arth arestu ke mat ke sarvaadhik nikat he? yadhyapi tatkaaleen dharmik paristhitiyon se arestu kaa prabhavit hona swaabhaavik he or swayan dharmik sangeet kii ore arestu ne sanket bhi kiya he ki jis prakaar dharmik sangeet shrotaaon ke bhaavon ko uttejit kar phir shant karata he, usee prakaar traasadee prekshak ke bhay ore karunaa ke bhaavon ko jagaakar baad main unhen upashmit karti he
 In relation to tragedy, this view is not literally correct, because the people who were cured by music were already emotional, whereas those who go to the auditorium are not in a mental state of compassion or fear
 atah virechan siddhanth kii prakalpana par ukt pratha kaa prabhaav apratyaksh to mana ja saktaa he; kintu sidhaa sambandh sthapit karnaa aavashyak he
 As far as ethical meaning is concerned, psychology also confirms this
 virechan se arestu ke taatpary bhaavon kaa nishkasana maatr nahin, varan unka santulan bhi he
 Similarly, the meaning of Prof
 Butcher is also worth considering
 unke anusaar virechan ke do paksh he- ek abhavatmak or doosraa bhavatmak
 The negative aspect is that he first stimulates the emotions, then after quenching them, he provides peace of mind
 iske baad sampann kalatmak parithosh uskaa bhavatmak paksh he
 It is not appropriate to give an emotional form to the phrase
 arestu kaa abhisht keval man kaa saamanjasy or tajjanya vimadta tak hi he, jiske aadhaar par vartmaan aalochak richards ne ‘antavritiyon ke samanjan’ kaa siddhanth pratipaadan kiya he
 Dr
 Nagendra is of the opinion that "the seeker of the art of taste is a must - the contemplated mind accepts the joy of art more quickly, but art of the taste is not an easy manifestation of art
" atev virechan siddhanth ko bhavatmak rup dena kadaachit nyaaysangat nahin he
 '' aadhunik vidwaanon ke matanusaar traas or karunaa kii bhavanaayen apane prakrut rup main adhik kshtprad banakar prakat hoti he
 As a result of the observation of tragedy, she publishes her affectionate and non-objectionable form
 is rup main ve nivaiyaktik evam saarvbhaum rup main saamne aati hai
 From this, the close relation of purgation and generalization can be easily seen
 yahan yah prashn uthta he ki kya traasadee ke prabhaav yaa prayojan ko samajhane ke liye virechan siddhanth hi ekmaatr samichin madhyam he? vastutah traasadee ke kaary ko rechan tak simit kar dena uske uddeshy ko sankeern banane jaisaa he
 In contrast, sentimental critics have tried to prove that the undesirable feelings also change and their excesses are erased by making the field of purgation extremely wide
 is vyapak drushtikon kaa pratipaadan dryden, edison aadi vidwaanon ne kiya
 Some scholars doubt the existence of the arbitration process
 unka akshep he ki vaastavik jivan main aisa virechan nahin hota he
 Karunadi becomes enlightened by tragedy, but the peace and tranquility is not complete by her deception
 vastav main traasadee kaa chamatkaar multah ragaatmak hota he
 She enlightens emotions through the process of arbitration, adjusts them and thus presents the role of joy
 yah virechan siddhanth kii mahatvapurn dein he
 The second objection is that the parts displayed in the tragedy are unrealistic, so they are not able to enlighten our sentiments, no matter of arbitration
 vastutah yah mat bhi uchit nahin he
 Bhavodevak by tragedy is certainly not the result of art-miracle, but a culmination of a positive effect
 sarabhoot samanjankaree prabhaav hi uski safalataa kaa kaaran he
 Therefore, convulsions are completely neutral
 manovishleshan shaastra ke anusaar bhaawanaaon kii atrupti yaa daman maansik rogon kaa pramukh kaaran he
 They can be thought through proper expression and emotion of emotion
 achetan man main pade bhav uchit abhivyakti ke abhaav main maansik granthiyon ko janm dete hai
 By bringing these glands to conscious level, suffocation and insatiableness of the mind is removed
 isse man kaa tanaav dur ho jaataa he or chitt ek prakaar kii vishadta evam halkaapan anubhav karata he
 This process is the basis of the free thought-flow system of psychoanalytic science
 is drushti se virechan kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar sarvatha pusht he
 Scholars like Freud have presented Aristotle sentences in many places in support of their views
 arestu dwaara pratipaadit traasadee ke prabhaav kaa bhartiya kavyashastra main karun ras se paryaapt samya he
 The basic impulses of tragic impact are compassion and tragedy
 ye donon bhav multah dukhad hai
 On the other hand, the permanent feeling of Karun Rasa is 'mourning'
 bhartiya kavyashastra ‘shok’ sthaayee bhav ke antargat karunaa ke saath traas ke astitv ko sweekaar karata he
 Favored destruction or misery are the causes of mourning
 inase karunaa or traas donon kii udbhuti hoti he
 The tragedy is experienced by the compassion of the disaster, the fear of recurrence of the same disaster
 kintu bhartiya aacharyon or arestu ke drushtikon main pramukh antar yah he ki arestu kaa traasad prabhaav ek mishra bhav he, jabaki bhartiya kavyashastra kaa shok sthaayee bhav multah amishra he, jaise - sita ke durbhaagya se utpann karunaa main traas kaa sparsh nahin he, jabaki arestu kii drushti main traasahin karun prasang adarsh sthiti nahin he

 Kunwar Narayan is known for seeing the present through history and myth in his creativity
 kunwar narayan kaa rachana sansar itnaa vyapak evam jatil he ki usko koi ek naam dena sambhav nahin
 Although the original genre of Kunwar Narayan has been poetry, apart from this, he has also written stories, articles and reviews as well as writing on cinema, theater and other arts
 iske chalate jahaan unke lekhan main sahaj sampreshniyata ai vahiin ve prayogdharmi bhi bane rahe
 His poems and stories have also been translated into many Indian and foreign languages
 ‘tanaav‘ patrika ke liye unhone kawaphi tathaa brorkhes kii kavitaaon kaa bhi anuwaad kiya he

 His poem began with 'chakravyuh'

 Through his collection 'ambient Hum Tum' we came across a rare interpretation of human relations
 unhone apane prabandh 'aatmajayi' main mrityu sambandhi shaashvat samasya ko kathopanishad kaa madhyam banaakar adbhut vyakhya ke saath hamaare saamne rakhaa
 In this, Nachiketa resurrects his father's command, 'death they are dead,' that is, i give you death, and goes to Yama's door, where he remains hungry and thirsty for three days, waiting for Yamraj to return home
 uski is sadhana se prasann hokar yamraj use teen vardaan maangane kii anumati dete hai

 The rare feature of this work is that by giving a very subtle sensory terminology to 'abstraction', the new enthusiasm test has been given to Jeejeevisha
 jahaan ek ore aatmajayi main kunvaranarayan ji ne mrityu jaise vishay kaa nirvachan kiya he, vahiin iske thik vipareet 'vajashrava ke bahaane'kriti main apni vidhayak samvednaa ke saath jivan ke alok ko rekhaankit kiya he

 Despite its size and fame, the mosque was rarely used by the Muslim community of the district and many petitions by Hindus in the courts resulted in the entry of Hindu devotees of Rama to the site
 babari masjid ke itihaas or iske sthaan par tathaa kisi pehle ke mandir ko todakar yaa usamen badlaav laakar ise banaaya gaya he yaa nahin, is par chal rahi raajnneetik, aitihaasik or saamaajik-dharmik bahes ko "ayodhya vivaad" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The architecture of this mosque evolved from temples or domestic styles adapted to its climate, terrain, materials; That is why there is a huge difference in the mosques of Bengal, Kashmir and Gujarat

 The sandy stones used in the construction of the Babri Masjid were also of resonant type, which contributed significantly to the unique acoustics

 Contemporary tithi-e-babri states that Babur's army "demolished a lot of Hindu temples in Chanderi"
 " In 1992, the inscription of a thick stone block from the wreckage of the demolished structure yielded paleographic evidence of an old Hindu temple at that site

 The following season, Cantona maintained an impressive performance that kept United's eye on winning their third consecutive league title, but on 25 January 1995 they were found involved in an incident that made headlines and sparked controversy around the world
 gave

 simons ke saath lage cantona ke pair kii us pal kii kukhyat tasviir ko anumati lekar, aish ke single "kung phu" ke mukhya prishth par istemaal kiya gaya

 He was banned from all football grounds in England and Wales, along with a fine of £ 500 for his conviction and punishment
 baad main bulaaye gaye ek patrkaar sammelan main cantona ne jo kaha, vah sambhawatah unka sarvaadhik prasiddh kathan he
 Perhaps referring to how the journalists monitored his behavior, Cantona said in a slow and restrained tone: "seagulls chase the trawlers because they think the sardines will be put into the sea
 You know a lot Thank you
" Then he got up from his seat and left many of the assembled crowd to his surprise

 In line with the Football Association's wishes, Manchester United suspended Cantona for the remaining four months of the 1994–95 season, forcing him to remain out of first team action while United were still waiting for the second double
 unhen 20,000 pound kaa jurmaana bhi kiya gaya tha
 The Football Association then extended the ban to eight months and imposed an additional fine of £ 10,000 on him
 egge ke mukhya kaaryakari graham keli ne unke hamale kaa varnan is prakaar kiya "hamaare khel par ek dhabba" jisane footbal ko sharminda kiya he
 FIFA then confirmed the suspension to be applicable worldwide, which meant that Cantona could not escape the ban by transferring to another foreign club
 Manchester United also fined Cantona two weeks of remuneration and lost the French captaincy; His club eventually lost the Premier League title to Blackburn
 2007 main unhone kaha, "mere paas bahut si acchhee yaaden he, lekin main jis ek ko pasand karata hoon vah he jab maine us badmaash ko laat maari
" Ever since the day of the Kung Fu incident, there has been countless speculation in the media that Cantona will leave English football at the end of the ban, but despite his desire to join the Italian club Internazionale, Alex Ferguson called him Manchester And then Cantona became inspirational once again
 apane nae anubandh par hastakshar karne ke baad bhi, cantona apane pratibandh kii sharton ke kaaran niraash the jisane unhen dostana muqablon main bhi khilne se vanchit kar diya tha or 8 agast ko unhone apane anubandh ko samaapt karne kaa ek nivedan saunp diya kyonki ve ab england main footbal nahin khelnaa chaahate the
 His request was turned down and two days later in a meeting with Alex Ferguson in Paris, he announced that he would remain at the club

 On 1 October 1995, there was a lot of hype about Cantona's return match against Liverpool - by that time United had recovered from their first day's defeat to come second in the league
 kai vyaktiyon dwaara yah ashanka bhi jaahir kii ja rahi thi ki ve phir kabhi english footbal team main apni jagah nahin bana paaenge, kyonki vipakshi team ke khilaadiyon or visheshkar unke samarthakon kii yantranaaen or tippaniyan unke liye asahneeya sabit ho sakati hai
 In his comeback game, Cantona scored a goal for Nikki Butt in the second minute of the game and then scored a penalty after Ryan Gibbs hit back
 aath maheene tak bagaiyr kisi pratispardhi footbal mukaable ke rahane par nihsandeh iskaa asar hua or cantona apane christmas ke pehle ke form ko paane ke liye sangharsh karte rahe or unke evam agrani team newcastle united ke bich kaa faaslaa disambar 24 tak badhkar 10 ankon tak pahunch gaya
 However, the situation changed again when a goal by Cantona in a league match at West Ham United in Upton Park in mid-january led to a 10-match victory in the league
 sijan ke uttarardh main, united kii 1-0 se jeet vaale kai anya maichon main cantona ne ekmaatr gol kiya, haalanki vastav main 9 march ko queens park rangers ke saath yah ek barabari kaa muqabla tha jiske baad united ne gol ke antar se newcastle par apni antim badhat bana lee thi
 They remained there for the rest of the season and, eliminating any lingering doubt of reaching the title, United won their third title in four seasons by beating Middlesbrough 3–0 at the Riverside Stadium on the last day of the season
 
 sanyogvash, yah ek 1-0 kaa score line tha or gol karne vaala khilaadi bhi vahi tha, jab liverpul ke khilaaf us varsh ke egge cap ke final mukaable main, cantona british dwipon ke baahar ke pehle aise khilaadi ban gaye jisane ek captain ke rup main egge cap ko hasil kiya tha
 The offensive moment of that match lasted 5 minutes and was probably the most famous goal of Cantona's career
 dayee ore se liye gaye ek corner ne liverpool ke rakshak david james ko pareshaan kiya jisane gend mukka maar diya
 The ball came to Cantona, who chased the ball while hitting the corner, then bounced the ball and scored the winning goal
