 pashuon main ardhasutrivibhaajan hameshaa yugmakon ke nirmaan main parinit hota he, jabaki anya jeevon main isse bijaanu utpann ho sakate hai
 Like mitosis, before meiosis begins, the DNA of the primordial cell repeats in the S-phase of the cell cycle
 do koshika vibhaajanon dwaara ye dohare chromosome chaar agunit yugmakon yaa bijaanuon main bant jate hai
 Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction and therefore occurs in all eukaryotes
 kuch ucaryociton main, visheshkar bideloid rotifaron main ardhasutrivibhaajan kii kshamta nahin hoti or ve anishekajanan dwaara prajnan karte hai
 Archaea or bacteria do not have meiosis and they reproduce through sexual processes such as binary fission
 ardhasutrivibhaajan ke samay dwiguneet janan koshika kaa jinom, jo chromosomon main bhare hue diene ke lambey hisson se bana hota he, kaa diene doharaapan or uske baad vibhaajan ke do daur hote hai, jisase chaar agunit koshikaayen utpann hoti hai
 Each of these cells contains an entire set of chromosomes of the original cell or half of its gene-content
 yadi ardhasutrivibhaajan se yugmak utpann hue, to ye koshikaayen ko garbhaadhan ke samay sanyojit hokar anya kisi bhi tarah ke vikaas ke pehle nai dwiguneet koshika yaa yagmaj kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Thus the division process of meiosis is an interaction between two genomes at the time of conception
 chunki har matapita ke chromosomon kaa ardhasutrivibhaajan ke samay samadharmi punahsanyog hota he, isaliye prayek yugmak or har yugmaj ke diene main ek anuthi sankethik ruparekha nihit hoti he
 Meiosis and conception both lead to sexuality in eukaryotes and to individuals with distinct genotypes in populations
 sabhi paudhon or kai protiston main ardhasutrivibhaajan ke parinamswaroop bijaanu naamak agunit koshikaon kaa nirmaan hota he jo bina garbhaadhan ke alangik tareeke se vibhajit ho sakati hai
 The gametes in these groups are produced by mitosis
 ardhasutrivibhaajan main chromosomon ke punahvitaran ke liye sutrivibhaajan main prayukt jaevrasynic paddatiyon main se hi kai paddatiyon kaa prayog hota he
 Meiosis has several unique features, the most important being the pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes
 miyosis shabd kaa mul miyo he, jiskaa matlab he-kam yaa alp
 Meiosis was discovered in 1876 by the noted German biologist Oscar Hertwig in the eggs of sea urchin and described it for the first time
 belgian jeevvaigyanik edward vaan benneden ne phir se iskaa vivaran chromosomon ke str par 1883 main escaris ke andon main diya
 The importance of meiosis in reproduction and heredity was first reported in 1890 by German biologist August Weismann, who stated that if cell numbers were to be maintained, two cell divisions were needed to convert a diploid cell into four haploid cells
 it occurs
 1911 main american jinshastri thomas hunt morgan ne drosophilia melenogoster ke ardhasutrivibhaajan main crossover hote dekha or pehla jeneey saboot diya ki chromosomon par jeenon kaa sancharan hota he
 Meiosis is thought to have originated 1
4 billion years ago
 eucaryociton ke keval ekscavetta naamak supergrup ke sabhi jeevon main ardhasutrivibhaajan nahin hota
 Meiosis genes are universally present in all of the other five main supergroups, Apisthoconta, Amebazoa, Rhizaria, Archeoplastida, and Chromalviolates, even if they are not always active
 Some Excavata species also have meiosis which supports the supposition that it is an ancient, paraphyletic group of clades
 aise eukarotic jeev, jisamen ardhasutrivibhaajan nahin hota, kaa ek udhaaharan euglinide he
 Meiosis occurs during sexual reproduction of eukaryotic life cycles, with frequent cyclic processes of meiosis and conception
 yah saamaanya sutrikoshika vibhaajan ke saath-saath jari rahata he
 In multicellular organisms there is an intermediate notch between the transition period from diploid to haploid where the organism develops
 jeev tab janan koshikaon kii utpatti karata he jo jivan-chakra main jari rahati hai
 The remaining cells, called somatic cells, function within the organism and die with it
 ardhasutrivibhaajan or garbhaadhan ke chakra ke kaaran agunit or dwiguneet dashaaen baari-baari se doharaai jaati hai
 The biological state of the life cycle can be in diploid state, haploid state, or both
 is tarah, jaivik avasthaaon ke sthaan ke anusaar, langik prajnan kaa prayog karne vaale teen prakaar ke jivan-chakra hote hai
 In the gametes life cycle, which also occurs in humans, the species is diploid and develops from a diploid cell called the zygote
 jeev kii dwiguneet janan-rekha stem koshikaayen ardhasutrivibhaajan dwaara agunit yugmakon kaa nirmaan karti hai jo sanyukt hokar yugmaj kaa nirmaan karte hai
 The diploid zygote undergoes cell division several times through mitosis to develop the organism
 sutrivibhaajan ardhasutrivibhaajan se sambandhit prakriya he jo paitruk koshika ke jinaatmak sadrush do koshikaon kaa nirmaan karti he
 The general principle is that somatic cells produce somatic cells and meiosis produce germ cells
 yugmaj jivan-chakra main jati agunit hoti he, jo yugmak naamak ek ekal agunit koshika ke prafalan or vibhedikaran se utpann hoti he
 Two organisms of different sexes form their diploid zygotes by providing their haploid germ cells
 is yugmaj kaa turant ardhasutrivibhaajan ho jaataa he, jisase chaar agunit koshikaon kii utpatti hoti he
 These cells form the organism through mitosis
 kai kavak or protojoa yugmaj jivan-chakra ke sadsy hai
 In the spore life cycle, the organism has alternating haploid and diploid conditions
 isaliye is chakra ko pidiyon kaa adal-badal bhi kaha jaataa he
 Spores are produced by meiosis of the diploid germ line cells
 ye bijaanu sutrivibhaajan dwaara prafalit hokar ek agunit jeev main viksit hote hai
 Then the germ cells of a haploid organism combine with other haploid organisms to form a zygote
 is yugmaj kaa baar-baar sutrivibhaajan or prafalan hokar punah dwiguneet jeev kaa vikaas hota he
 Spore life cycles can be called a combination of gametes and zygotic life cycles
 chunki ardhasutrivibhaajan ek ‘ek-tarafa’ prakriya he, isaliye sutrivibhaajan kii tarah koshika-chakra main juta hua nahin mana ja saktaa he
 But the type and name of the steps of its preparation before meiosis are similar to the interfaces of the mitosis cell cycle
 interfez kii teen avasthaaen hoti hai- Interphase is followed by meiosis i and then meiosis II
 ardhasutrivibhaajan i main do sahodara chromatidon se bane samarupi chromosomon kii jodiyaan alag hokar do koshikaon main badal jaati hai
 Each female cell contains an entire haploid volume of chromosomes; The first meiosis reduces the quality of the original cell by a factor of 2
 ardhasutrivibhaajan II main prayek chromosome ke sahodara dhaagon kaa pruthakkikaran hota he or vyaktigat chromated agunit kanya koshikaon main bant jate hai
 Two cells arising from meiosis i divide during meiosis II, forming 4 haploid female cells
 ardhasutrivibhaajan i or II dono, profez, metafez, anophez or tilophez main bante hote hai, jinka uddheshy sutrivibhaajan koshika chakra ke samarupi usivasthaaon ke samaan hi hota he
 Therefore, meiosis includes the stages of meiosis i and meiosis II
 ardhasutrivibhaajan jeneey vividhta ko do tarah se utpann karata he swatantra sanrekhan or tatpashchaat pehle ardhasutrivibhaajan ke samay samarupi chromosomon kii jodiyon kaa pruthakkikaran, jisase prayek chromosome segregeton kaa prayek yugmak main aniyat or swatantra chunaav hota he or profez i main samarupi punahsanyog dwaara samarupi chromosomiy kshetron kaa bhautik vinimay hokar chromosomon ke bheetar diene ke nae sangyojan banate hai
 Meiosis i separates homologous chromosomes to form two haploid cells, so it is called negative division
 niyamit dwiguneet maanav koshika main 46 chromosome hote hai or use 2N mana jaataa he kyonki usamen samarupi chromosomon kii 23 jodiyaan hoti hai
 But after meiosis I, although the cell contains 46 chromatids, it is considered 23 chromosome N
 aisa isaliye hota he kyonki aage chalakar anophez i main, jis samay tarku sahodara chromatidon ko nai koshika ke dhruvon kii taraf khinchataa he, tab yah jodi saath main bani rahati he
 Meiosis II has equidistant division similar to that of mitosis, whereby the sibling chromatids eventually divide and a total of 4 haploid cells per daughter cell produced from the first division
 profez i main samarupi punahsanyog naamak prakriya se samarupi chromosomon ke bich diene kaa aadan-pradaan hota he
 This often leads to chromosomal crossover
 crassovar ke samay bane diene ke nae sangyojan jeneey parivartanon ke mahatvapurn strot hote he or eleelon ke nae laabhadaayak sanyojanon kii utpatti kar sakate hai
 Couple and double chromosomes are called bivalents or tetrads, which contain two chromosomes and four chromatids, with one chromosome derived from each parent
 is avasthaa main, kiyazma naamak vinduon par asahaadaraa chromatidon kaa crassovar ho saktaa he
 The first stage of prophase i is the leptotene stage, also known as leptonema
 is avasthaa main, akele chromosome kendrak ke bheetar lambey bhaagon main sanghanit hone lagata hai
 But both sibling chromatids are still so tightly bound that they cannot be distinguished from each other
 zaigotin dasha main, jise zaigonima bhi kaha jaataa he, chromosome samarupi chromosome jodiyon ke choop main paas-paas qatari main jamaa ho jate hai
 This is called the bouquet stage, because the telomeres converge at one end of its corresponding nucleus
 is dasha main, samarupi chromosomon kaa yugaleekaran hota he
 In the pachytene condition, also known as pachinima, the following chromosomal crossovers occur
 samarupi chromosomon ke asahodara chromated betaratib tareeke se samroop kshetron par jeneey jaankaree ke bhaagon kaa vinimay karte hai
 But sexual chromosomes are not completely uniform and only exchange information over a small region of homology
 vinimay un sthanon par hota he jahaan par punahsangyojan ganthen banati hai
 The exchange of information between non-homologous chromatids leads to recombination of information; Each chromosome has the same complete set of information that it had before and there are no errors due to this process
 Since chromosomes cannot be detected in the synaptonimal complex, the cross-over cannot actually be seen with a microscope
 diplotine dasha main, jise diplonima bhi kaha jaataa he, greek shabd, arthath - ‘do dhaage’) syneptonimal complex avakramit ho jaataa he or samarupi chromosome ek duusare se jaraa dur ho jate hai
 The chromosomes themselves also open up, causing some transcription of DNA
 lekin, prayek bivalent ke samarupi chromosome crossingover ke kshetron, kiyasmata par balpurvak bandhe hote hai
 Chiasmata persist on chromosomes until dissociated into anaphase I
 maanav bhrun dimbujanan main viksit ho rahe sabhi dimb is avasthaa tak viksit hote hai or janm ke pehle yah vikaas book jaataa he
 This suspended state is called the Dictyotene condition and remains so until puberty
 nar main yauvanarambh main ardhasutrivibhaajan ke shuru hone tak keval shukranujan rahete hai
 In the diakinesis state, which in Greek means 'transfer', the chromosomes are further condensed
 is meiosis jahaan tetrads ke chaar bhaagon main dikhaai de rahe hai vastav main pehla bindu he
 Cross-entanglement together, effectively overlapping sites, making chiasmata clearly visible
 isko chhodkar, is dasha kaa baaki bhaag bilkul sutrivibhaajan ke prometafez ke samaan hi hota he, upakendrak gaayab ho jate hai, kendrakeey jhilli putikaaon main parivartit ho jaati he tathaa ardhasutrivibhaajanik tarku banane lagata he
 In these cases, two asterisks that pair with asterisks of animal cells migrate to both poles of the cell
 ye tarak kaay jo S-avasthaa main pratikrut hue the, sookshmanalikaaon, jo vastav main koshikeey rassiyaan or khambe hai, ke kendrakikaran karne vaale sookshmanalika sanghathan kendron kaa kaam karte hai
 Microtubules invade the nucleus after the nucleus is destroyed and connect the chromosomes to the chromosome
 gunasutrabindu ek motor kii tarah kaam karata he-vah chromosomon ko sanlagn sookshmanalikaaon ke saath tarak kaay kii ore khinchataa he, jaise koi train patari par chalati he
 Each tetrad has four chromosomes, but the pair of chromosomes on each sibling chromatid combines and acts as a unit during meiosis I
 gunasutrabinduon se sanlagn sookshmanalikaayen gunasutri sookshmanalikaayen kehalaati hai
 Other microtubules interact with the microtubules of the opposing asterisks; These are called the apical microtubules or polar microtubules
 ek teesri prakaar kii sookshmanalikaayen, tarak sookshmanalikaayen tarak kaay se jeevadravya menjati hai yaa jhilli- kankal ke bhaagon se sampark karti hai
 Homologous pairs move along the metaphase plate
 jaise-jaise dono tarak kaayon se nikali gunasutribindu sookshmanalikaayen unase sambandhit gunasutribinduon se sanlagn hoti hai, samarupi chromosomon ke dono gunasutribinduon se utpann sookshmanalikaaon dwaara bivolenton par lagaae gaye aviral paraspar virdohi balon ke kaaran samarupi chromosome ek bumadhya tal main tarku ko katate hue vyavasthit ho jate hai
 The physical basis of the independent configuration of chromosomes is the random orientation of each bivalent on the metaphase plate against other bivalents along the same equator
 gunasutribindu sookshmanalikaayen choti hokar punahsangyojan parvon se alag ho jaati hai or samarupi chromosomon ko alag kar detii hai
 As each chromosome has the same active pair of chromosomes, all chromosomes are pulled towards the opposing poles, forming two haploid sets
 har chromosome main abhi bhi sahodara chromatidon kii ek jodi hoti he
 The apical point microtubules lengthen and push the asterisks away
 koshika centre ke neeche kii ore vibhaajan kii taiyaari main lambi hone lagati he
 The final meiosis effectively ends with the chromosomes arriving at the poles
 ab har putree koshika main chromosomon kii sankhya aadhi hoti he kintu har chromosome main chromatidon kii ek jodi hoti he
 The microtubules that make up the spindle network disappear, and each haploid set surrounds a new nucleus membrane
 chromosome khulkar punah chromatin main parivartit ho jate hai
 The degradation of cell membranes in animal cells or the formation of cell wall in vegetative cells is called cytokinesis, with the completion of the function of two daughter cells
 sahodara chromated tilofez 1 ke samay sanlagn bane rahete hai
 Cells may enter a state of relaxation i
e
 interkinesis or interfase II
 is avasthaa main diene kaa doharaana nahin hota he
 Meiosis II is the second stage of this process
 is prakriya kaa adhikansh bhaag sutrivibhaajan ke samaan hi hota he
 To that end, two haploid cells produced in meiosis i produce 4 haploid cells
 ardhasutrivibhaajan II ke chaar mukhya kadam hai-profez II, metafez II, anaafez II or tilofez II
 In prophase II, both the subculture and the centripetal crystals are disrupted and at the same time the chromatids become smaller and macro
 tarakkaay dhruviya kshetron kii ore chale jate hai tathaa tarku ke reshon ko dwitiya ardhasutrivibhaajan ke lique vyavasthit karne lagate hai
 In metaphase II, centromerers have two chromosomes that attach at each pole to the spherical fibers of asterisks
 nai bhumadhyarekhiy metafez plate ardhasutrivibhaajan i kii tulana main pichhali plate se 90 degree par gum jaati he
 This is followed by anaphase II, in which the centromere dislocates, allowing microtubules attached to the cytoplasm to pull apart the chromatids
 vipakshi dhruvon kii ore badhate sahodara chromatidon ko ab sahodara chromosome kaha jaataa he
 The process is terminated with telophase II, which is similar to telophase I, and the chromosomes open up and elongate and the spindle disappears
 kendrik aavaran punah banate or vibhajit hote hai yaa koshika-bhitti nirmaan antat kul chaar putree koshikaon kii utpatti karata he, jisamen prayek main chromosomon kaa ek agunit set hota he
 Meiosis is now complete and four new daughter cells are produced
 ardhasutrivibhaajan sthir langik prajnan kaa maarg prashast karata he
 At conception without multiplying or halving chromosomes, zygotes are produced that have double the number of chromosomes from zygotes of the previous generation
 kramik pidiyon main aisa hone par chromosomon kii sankhya main bhayankar vruddhi ho jaaegi
 saamanytah dwiguneet jeevon main bahugunitha, yani teen yaa adhik chromosome seton kii upasthiti, ke kaaran teevr vikaas vikaar hote hai
 adhikansh pashu jatiyon main bahugunitha ko sahan nahin kiya jaataa
 lekin podhe saamanytah upjau, jeevaksham bahugunak paidaa karte hai
 Multiplicity has been considered an important process in vegetation
 samarupi chromosomon kaa punahsangyojan or swatantra vinyas janata main ginotipon kii adhik vividhta kaa kaarak hota he
 This leads to genetic diversity in gametes, thereby promoting genetic and phenotypic diversity in the offspring
 ardhasutrivibhaajan 1 main chromosomon kaa saamaanya pruthakkikaran yaa ardhasutrivibhaajan II main sahodara chromatidon kaa pruthakkikaran disjunkshan kehalaata he
 When dissociation is not normal, it is called nondisjunction
 iske parinamswaroop aise yugmakon kii utpatti hoti he jinamein kisi vishisht chromosome kii sankhya bahut zyada yaa bahut kam hoti he or trisomi yaa monosomi kii saadhaaram prakriya he
 Nondisjunction can occur in meiosis i or meiosis II, in stages of cellular reproduction, or during mitosis
 yah manushyon main hone vaali kai bimariyon kaa kaaran he : In females, meiosis occurs in cells called oocyte
 prayek dimbanuprasujan jo ardhasutrivibhaajan kii shuruuaat karata he, do baar vibhajit hokar ek ekal dimbjan or do dhruviya kaayon kii utpatti karata he
 However, before these divisions occur, these cells stop at the diplotene stage of meiosis i and lie dormant within a protective covering of somatic cells called a follicle
 ye coop kupjnan naamak ek prakriya dwaara sthir gati se viksit hone lagate hai or inamen se kuch masik chakra main pravesh kar jate hai
 Menstruated ovations continue meiosis i and remain on meiosis II until conception
 maadaaon main ardhasutrivibhaajan kii prakriya dimbujanan ke samay hoti he or prarupi ardhasutrivibhaajan se bhinn hoti he kyonki isamen ardhasutrivibhaajan lambey samay tak dictyet dasha main ruka rahata he or tarak kaayon kii sahaayta se vanchit hota he
 In males, meiosis occurs in precursor cells called spermatozoa, which divide twice and turn into sperm
 ye koshikaayen vrishanon kii veeryajanak nalikaaon main bina ruke lagaataar vibhajit hoti jaati hai
 Semen is produced at a constant speed
 naron main ardhasutrivibhaajan kii prakriya shukranujanan ke samay hoti he
 In female mammals, meiosis begins soon after the primary reproductive cells in the embryo reach the ovaries
 lekin nar main ardhasutrivibhaajan kai saalon ke baad yauvanarambh ke samay shuru hota he
 Retinoic acid derived from the uncultivated kidney stimulates meiosis in ovarian oocyte
 nar vrushan ke utak retinoik acid kaa apksham karke ardhasutrivibhaajan ko hone se rokte hai
 This is overcome when at the time of puberty the sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules themselves begin to produce retinoic acid
 retinoik acid ke prati samvedansheeltaa nainos or djaidel naamak proteinon dwaara bhi samyojit kii jaati he
 Meiosis occurs in spermatocytes

 Fossils provide direct evidence of organic growth
 inke adhyayan ko jeevashm vigyaan yaa palantology kehete hai
 Inspection of different types of fossils shows that different types of animals have occurred in different periods on Earth
 pracheenatam jeevashm nikshepon main keval saralatam jeevon ke avshesh upasthit hai kintu abhinav nikshepon main kramshah adhik jatil jeevon ke avshesh praapt hote hai
 As we study ancient times from ancient to ancient times, fossils seem to be very similar to living organisms
 anek madhyavarti lakshanon vaale jeev bataate hai ki saral rachana vaale jeevon se jatil rachana vaale jeevon kaa vikaas hua he
 Most of the fossils are not archival but almost complete series of fossils of horse, camel, elephant, man etc
 have been unearthed which provide solid evidence of organic growth
 jeevashm ko angreji main fossil kehete hai
 The word originates from the Latin word "fossilus", which means "digger
" saamaanya: jeevashm shabd se ateet kaal ke bhoumikeey yugon ke un jaev avasheshon se taatpary he jo bhuparpati ke avsaadee shailon main paae jate hai
 These fossils reveal that they are of biological origin and have biological evidence in themselves
 praaniyon or padpon ke jeevashm banane ke liye do baton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The first essential thing is that it is very important to have skeletons, or some kind of rigid limbs, which can be preserved in the rocks as fossils
 jeevon ke komalang ati sheeghra vighatit ho jane ke kaaran jeevashm dasha main parirakshit nahin rah sakate
 In the geological ages, there were many communities of organisms on Earth that did not have any rigid organs or skeletons in their bodies, so fossilists are deprived of the study of groups of such organisms, because no part of them is found to be preserved in fossil form
 To study
 at: jeevashm vigyaan kshetra unheen praaniyon tathaa padpon ke virgon tak simit he jo fossil banane ke yogya the
 The second essential thing is that the skeletons or hard organs should be covered immediately with sediments to avoid decay and disintegration
 thalwasi jeevon ke sthaayee samadhisth hone kii sambhaavna ati viral hoti he, kyonki sthal par aise bahut kam sthaan hote hai jahaan par avsaad satat bahut badi maatra main sanchit hote rahete hon
 In very rare circumstances, the hard parts of the living organisms have been found to be shielded due to the sand being pressed into the sand or by landslides
 jalawaasi jeevon ke fossil hone kii sambhaavna atyadhik anukool isliye hoti he ki avsaadan sthal kii apeksha jal main hi bahut adhik hota he
 Even in these aquatic sediments, a large number of fauna remains are found in aquatic sediments that form in the womb of the sea, because the sea is the site where sedimentation is the most frequent
 vibhinn virgon ke jeevon or padpon ke kathor bhaagon ke aakaar or rachana main bahut bhed hota he
 In insects and hydra classes the hard parts are of a substance called chitin, many sponges and diatoms are made of sand, vertebral bones mainly contain calcium carbonate and phosphate, corals, echinodermata, mollusca and many other creatures
 And some plants contain calcium carbonate and other plants mostly consist of wood tissue
 in sab padaarthon main se kytin badi kathinaayee se ghulaayaa ja saktaa he
 Sand, when it is emitted by animals, dissolves very quickly
 yahi kaaran he ki baaluu ke bane kankal bade sheeghra ghul jate hai
 In calcareous skeletons, lime carbonate dissolves very quickly in water containing carbonic acid, but the solubility varies according to the amount of carbonate of lime
 churniy kankal kailcite athwa eregonite ke bane hote hai
 Of these, calcite shells are more durable and durable than aragonite shells
 adhikansh praaniyon ke kavach kailcite athwa eregonite ke bane hote hai
 The fossils preserved in sedimentary rocks are of the following types: sampurna parirakshit praani - aisa bahut viral hota he ki bina kisi prakaar ke vighatan ke kisi praani kaa jeevashm praapt ho, kintu aise parirakshit jeevashm ke udhaaharan maimath or rhinosiris ke jeevashm hai, jo tundra ke him main jame hue paae gaye hai
 Skeletons often found preserved in unchanged condition - Sometimes when only the skeleton is shielded in the shells, it has been seen that it is in its former state, when it was in the tomb
 parivartan keval itnaa hota he ki fossil dasha main kankal se carbonic dravyon kaa lop ho jaataa he
 Carbonization - In some plants and some animals, such as graptolite, which consists of skeletal chitin, the basic material is carbonized
 jeev main aghatan hota he, jiske falswaroop oxigen or nitrogen kaa lop ho jaataa he or carbon rah jaataa he
 Skeletal mold - Sometimes skeletons or armor disappear and only their mold remains in their place
 yah is prakaar hota he ki kavach ke avsaad se dhak jane ke uparaant, kavach kaa aantarik bhaag bhi avsadwale dravya se bhar jaataa he
 After this, carbonic acid mixed water leaks into the rock to reach the point where the shell remains buried and completely dissolves it as bicarbonate of calcium
 iske parinamswaroop kavach ke sthaan par kavach ke aantarik or bahya aakaar kaa keval ek saanchaa dekhne ko miltaa he
 The space between these two was originally armor and if this space is filled with wax, then the true structure of the armor is found
 ashmibhavan - kabhi kabhi fosilon main un jeevon ke, jinke ye fossil ho gaye hai, sookshm aakaar tak dekhne ko milte hai
 The only difference is that the original substance of the skeletons is replaced by a mineral
 is kriya ko ashmibhavan kehete hai
 The best example of Ashmi Bhavan is Ashmibhut wood which is seen in the same way as the wood of living plants
 yah parivartan is prakaar hota he ki jab adikashth kaa ek kan hatataa he tab uske sthaan par turant baaluu athwa anya kisi khanij kaa ek kan aa jaataa he, jisase kashtha kaa aadi aakaar jyon kaa tyon bana rahata he
 The main minerals used to remove the basic material by this method are: carbonate of calcium, sand, iron oxide, iron oxide and sometimes sulfate of calcium etc
 chihn - kabhi-kabhi jeev jantuon ke padchihn bill, chhidr aadi shailon main paae jate hai
 Although they are not part of the rigid organs of animals, and therefore cannot be called fossils, they are thought to be of equal importance as fossils
 jeevashmon ke upyog nimnlikhit hai : Use of Fossils in Correlation of Shells - The organisms that we find today as fossils must have been in a certain period of a geological age
 at: ve hamaare lae bade mahatv ke hai
 It has been well known since William Smith and Cuvay, the father of layered geology, that there is a definite connection between the fossils found in sedimentary rocks and the location of their geological columns
 yah bhalee bhanti pataa lag chukaa he ki shailen jitani alpaayu hongi utana hi unamem praapt praani vibhinn prakaar ke or padpasamudaay jatil hoga or ve jitani dderghaayu hongi utana hi saral or saadhaaran unka jeevashmasamudaay hoga
 Thus, fossils have a prominent place in deciding the level position of rocks and they have proved of great importance
 cambrionpurv ke pracheen shailon main jeevashm nahin paae jate
 Therefore, in the absence of fossils, correlation of these rocks with the help of fossils is not established
 cambrian se lekar aaj tak ke bhoumikeey stambh ke samast bhaagon ke praani or padpon kaa pataa laga liya gaya he
 Therefore, it is now relatively easy to find even parts of these parts in any part of the earth
 jeevashm pracheen kaal ke bhugol ke suchak - purabhugol ke antargat, pracheen kaal ke sthal or samudr kaa vistaran, us kaal kii saritaayen, jhil, maidan, parvat aadi aate hai
 According to a particular environment, organisms adapt themselves to the situation, this is as much in true modern times as it was in the geological ages of the true past
 at: jeevashmon kii sahaayta se ham yah pataa laga sakate hai ki kis sthaan par delta, parvat, nadi, samudratat, chhichley athwa gahare samudr the, kyonki sthal main rahanevaale jeev, jalawaale jeevon se or jal main rahanevaale jeevon main alvan jalawaasi jeev lavan jalawaasi jeevon se sarvatha bhinn hote hai
 Indicators of fossil antecedents - With the help of fossils one can even estimate the extent of climate of geological ages
 is disha main sthal padpon dwaara pradaan kiye gaye pramaan vishesh mahatv ke hote hai, kyonki unka vistaran samudri jeevon kii apeksha adhikanshat: taap ke anusaar hota he or ve saraltapurvak jalwaayu ke anusaar bhinn bhinn bhaagon main pruthak kiye ja sakate hai
 Some of the marine organisms expand according to climatic conditions, such as coral, which live in warm climates
 jeevashm jeevvikas ke suchak - jeevashmon ne jeevvikas ke siddhant par bahut prakaash daalaa he or bina jeevashmon kii sahaayta ke jeevvikas kaa anurekhan karnaa asambhav sa he
 The fossils are collected both in terms of fossil and layered rock sciences
 jeevashmon ke sangrah ke samay nimnlikhit baton kaa sadaiv dhyaan rakhana chahie : If the geological composition is short-lived, then all fossils should be collected, whether complete or fragmentary
 yadi jeevashmon kaa nikaalnaa asambhav na ho to kabhi bhi purna jeevashmon ko chhod na dena chahie
 They should be removed easily
 aisa khandamay jeevashm, jisamen savistaar aakaarkiya lakshan milte hon un anek purna jeevashmon se kahin adhik mahatv kaa he, jinamein aakaarkiya lakshanon kaa abhaav ho
 Never try to identify fossils in the area
 yadi jeevashmon kaa sangrah starit-shail-vigyaan kii drushti se kiya gaya ho to alag alag prayek rachana se jeevashmon kaa sangrah aavashyak he
 It is very important to determine from which level the fossils have been stored, because the collection of fossils is often meaningless without knowing it
 iskaa nishchay sugamawa ke saath jeevashmsangrah ke samay kiya ja saktaa he
 Along with the collection of fossils, the main main and distinctive features of stylistic compositions should also be written
 jeevashmsangrah main jeevashm vigyaani ke liye ek halkaa hathaudaa, chheni, choti-choti theliyaan or raddi kaagaj bade upyogi hote hai
 If large fossils are discovered, attention should first be paid to weatherproof levels
 yadi jeevashm yahan nahin dikhaai padate, to haal hi main bhang hue aadhaar main paae jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 If a fossil appears to be lying in a hard rock, one should not attempt to remove it suddenly, but find cracks in its vicinity
 in daraaron se shail ke vah bhaag aasaani se tode ja sakate hai jinamein jeevashm lage hue hai
 In this way, while removing fossils, it should always be kept in mind that hammer on the shell should be run as far as possible from the fossil
 aisa karne se jeevashm ke tuutane kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he or shail sahit jeevashm alag ho jaataa he
 If it is to collect small fossils like Foraminifera, then it is obviously impossible to collect them one by one
 aisi dasha main aabaddh shailon, athwa shail namoonon kaa hi sangrah karnaa uchit hoga
 The material brought in this way is later compiled in the laboratory and when viewed from a hand lens, many small fossils are seen in it, which can be separated from the base with the help of sieve
 kshetra main jeevashmon ke sangrah ke uparaant prayek jeevashm ke saath ek leb laga dena chahie, jisamen do baton kaa ullekh bada aavashyak hota he : vah yatharth str, jisase jeevashm liya gaya he or sthaan kaa naam, jahaan se jeevashm kaa sangrah kiya gaya he
 After doing this, the fossil should be brought to the laboratory, wrapped in scrap paper and tied with a string
 shail aadhaar se jeevashm nikaalane kii vidhi ek prakaar kii kala he
 No firm rules can be told in this regard, because different types of problems arise
 kis vidhi se or kaise jeevashm ko prastar se alag kiya ja saktaa he, isko ek anbhavi jeevashm vigyaani jeevashm ko dekhakar samaj letaa he
 The rock bases in which fossils lay exposed range from soft soil to dense rock, whose hardness can be comparable to steel
 jeevashm kii kathorta kii seemaa main itnaa adhik antar nahin hota
 While extracting fossils, it is the intention of the paleontologist to separate the fossil from the rock without harming it in any way
 yadi aadhaar jeevashm kii apeksha mridu prakruti kaa he, to use sugamawapurvak ek brush kii sahaayta se hataa sakate hai
 If fossils are found in an unconformed limestone, we can also separate it with the help of toothbrush brush
 yadi shail aadhaar chaak prakruti kaa he to danta upkaran main bhramit brush kii sahaayta se use alag kar sakate hai
 On other occasions when fossils are brittle and are firmly attached to the base of the rock, it is difficult to separate the fossils by hammering them
 aisi dasha main prastar ko kai baar garam karke tunrat pani main daal dene se, jeevashmon kaa prastar se algaav saralata se ho jaataa he
 In extracting fossils such as Foraminifera from sand and other limestone rocks, the shell is first broken and then sieved into a variety of sieves
 isamen jeevashm shail bhaag se alag ho jate hai
 When the rocks are hardened, another method is used
 shail ko chote chote tukdon main tod lete hai or phir unako itnaa garm karte hai ki ve purnat: suukh jaaen or phir unako isi garm avasthaa main hi thande pani main daal dete hai
 In this way the hard soil gets decomposed into the mud and then finally the fossils are washed from the stone part and separated
 jab yantric ritiyon se jeevashmon kaa pruthakkaran sambhav nahin hota tab rasinic vidhiyaan prayog main laai jaati hai
 The simplest of these is the method of weathering, which in many cases decomposes the rock base without harming fossils
 bahut hi tanu amla ke upyog main laane se yah kriya shigh ho jaati he
 Here, it would be appropriate to state that acid should be used with great caution, as the cages of most fossils are calcareous and have an immediate effect on the acid
 saadhaarant: costic potash thik prakaar kaa abhikaarak he, jiskaa bina kisi bhay ke upyog kar sakate hai
 Its tiny particles are put in the dry state on the whole shell base which has to be removed
 chunk costic potash prasvedhy prakruti kaa hota he
 Hence, it enters inside the base and decomposes it
 yah ekinoderma, athwa molsk, ko koi kshati nahin pahunchaata
 It should not be used in Brachiopoda, as it is easily inserted into their scaly panes, causing their layers to separate
 ant main jeevashmon ko acchhee prakaar jal se dho daalana chahie
 Separation of shielded graptolite and plant fossils in shale like rocks is done by "transfer method"
 is pruthakkaran kii mukhya mukhya baaten nimnlikhit hai : The bottom of the specimen, which contains the fossils, is glued down to the slide of the slab with the help of canada balasam
 shell kaa jitna bhaag sugamawa se kaata yaa ghisa ja saktaa ho use kaat athwa ghis lete hai
 The shells soak the floor and then submerge it in the melted wax
 mom ardra tal se sugamawa se pruthak ho jaataa he or kaach par koi rasinic kriya nahin hone detaa
 Put the entire fossil containing the shell in the acid of hydrofluoric acid
 yah jeevashm ko tanik bhi kshati pahunchaae bina shell bhaag ko galaa detaa he
 Plant or graptolite fossils should be covered with cover glass after washing
 is prakaar se nikaale gaye graptolite or kuch padap jaise komal jeevashmon ke aadhunik jeevon kii bhanti sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se pariched banaae ja sakate hai
 Rigid fossils can also be made by grinding away
 isamen ghiste samay niyamit avadhiyon par photon lenaa padataa he
 The biggest flaw in this method is that the fossil that is tested with this method is destroyed

 Then he was surprised and praised Lord Shiva

 Napoleon is counted among the greatest generals in the world in history
 usne ek france main ek nayi vidhi samhita lagu kii jise nepolian kii samhita kaha jaataa he
 He was one of the greatest winners of history
 uske saamne koi ruk nahin paa rahaa tha
 Until he invaded Russia in 1812, where his army was greatly damaged by the cold and the atmosphere
 18 june 1815 waterlu ke yuddh main paraajay ke pashchaat angrazon ne use andh mahaasaagar ke dur dweep saint helena main bandi bana diya
 He died there at the end of six years
 itihaaskaaron ke anusaar angrezon ne use sankhiya kaa vish dekar maar daalaa
 Napoleon was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajasi, the following year after the reunification of Carcica and France
 uske pita charles bonapart ek chirkaalin kuleen parivaar ke the
 Their lineage is said to be from the Tuscany region of Italy adjacent to Carcica
 charles bonapart french darbar main carsika kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 He was married to an aristocratic beauty named Leticia Remolino, who was born Napoleon
 charles ne french shashan ke viruddh carsican vidroh main bhaag bhi liya tha, kintu antat: french shakti se samya sthapit karnaa hi shreyaskar samajha
 By the grace of the French Governor Marbiff, he also had the opportunity to join a consultation in Versailles
 charles ke saath uski dwitiya putr napolian bhi tha
 Inspired by the bright future that his personality indicated, the French authorities offered Breen a scholarship to study at the military academy and received his education there from 1779 to 1784
 taduparant paris ke sainik skool main use apana topakhane sambandhi gyaan pusht karne kaa avasar lagbhag ek varsh tak mila
 Thus Napoleon's childhood was spent in the French environment
 balyavastha main hi saare parivaar ke bharan poshan kaa uttardaayitv komal kandhon par pad jane ke kaaran use vaataavaran kii jatilta evam uske anusaar vyavhaar karne kii kushalta mil gai thi
 Therefore, his entry into the French Revolution was indicative of epoch-making events
 france ke vibhinn virgon se sampark sthapit karne main use koi sankoch yaa hichkichaahat nahin thi
 He also entered the Jacobin contingent and was introduced to events directly on the occasion of Tuileri's right on 20 June
 france ke rajtantr kii durdasha kaa bhi use purna gyaan ho gaya tha
 This is where the huge personality of Napoleon emerges
 napolian ke udai tak french kranti purna araajaktaa main parivartit ho chuki thi
 The 'reign of terror' was conducted as a result of the rivalry and disharmony of the Jacobin and Girndist parties, in which all the revolutionaries, even Rabspier himself, were killed one by one
 1793 i main tulaan ke ghere main napolian ko pratham baar apana shaury evam kalapradarshan kaa avasar mila tha
 Bairas, a prominent ruler of the directory, was attracted by his talent
 phir 1795 main jab bheed kanrveshan ko hui thi, to directory dwaara vishesh rup se ayukta hone par napolian ne kushaltapurvak kanvension kii raksha kii or samvidhan ko hone diya
 These successes drew the attention of all France to Napoleon and the directory gave him the lead in the Italian campaign
 ek saptaah pashchaat usne jojephin se vivaah kiya or taduparant apni sena sahit italy main pravesh kiya
 The Italian campaign was a vivid example of Napoleon's military and administrative ability
 is baat kii ghoshnaa purv hi kar di gai thi ki french sena italy ko austria kii daastaa se mukt karaane aa gayi he
 He severed ties with Austria by defeating the enemy at the first three places
 tab sardenia ko yudhviram karne ke liye vivash kar diya
 He then received Milan in Lodi's place
 revoli ke yuddh main mentua ko samarpan karnaa padaa
 Archduke Charles also had to submit the treaty and the Luban agreement was reached
 in saare yudhon or vaartaon main napolian ne paris se kisi prakaar kaa aadesh nahin liya
 The Pope also had to make a treaty
 lombardi ko sisalpine tathaa jinoa ko ligurian ganatantr main parivartit kar french namoonay par ek vidhaan diya
 These successes caused Austria to lose its footing and had to turn to Napoleon for the Treaty of Campo Fermi, and in this complex situation, Austria had to withdraw its hand from its Bellary territories and from the Rhine frontiers and Lombardy
 napolian ke in yudhon se tathaa chote rajyon ko samaapt kar vrihat ikai main parivartit karne ke kaaryon se, italy main ek rashtriya andolan khadaa hua jo itihaas main risorgimento ke naam se prasiddh he
 On his return from the Italian expedition, Napoleon received a grand welcome
 directory bhi bhaybheet ho gai tathaa napolian ko france se dur rakhane kaa upaay sochane lagi
 At this time, the rival of France was left only to Britain
 napolian ne britain ko haraane ke liye uske samrajya par kutharaghaat na karnaa uchit samajha tathaa apni misr-abhiyaan-yojana rakhi
 The directory immediately accepted him
 1798 i main bonapart ne misr ke liye prasthaan kiya
 The plan of ending the eastern kingdom of Britain through Egypt instead of making a direct attack on Britain seemed compatible with the French rulers
 mimluk turki se iskaa saamana paramid ke tathakthith yuddh main hua
 But the Mediterranean president of the British Navy was chasing Commander Nelson Napoleon efficiently
 usne aage badhkar francisiyon ko nil nadi ke yuddh main teetar-bitar kar diya tathaa turki ko bhi englad kii ore se yuddh main pravesh karne ke liye vivash kar diya
 Nelson's success gave Britain the opportunity to form a second bloc, and the nations of Europe, which Napoleon had suppressed, began preparing for a campaign against France
 turki ke yuddh main pravisht ho jane par napolian ne syria kaa abhiyaan chhedaa
 With only a limited contingent of thirteen thousand marched towards Acker but stopped by a skilled fighter like Sidney Smith
 yah napolian ke liye vardaan siddh hua
 Now Napoleon was involved in the creation of another French empire in Syria
 kintu france is samay ek najuk sthiti se guzar rahaa tha
 Therefore, Napoleon considered it desirable to appear in France, despite being successful in establishing his power in Egypt
 napolian ke france main pravesh karte hi halchal paidaa ho gai
 Finding a favorable environment, in November 1799, Napoleon seized power and disbanded the directory and enacted a new legislation
 is vidhaan ke anusaar teen kaunsal niyukt hue
 After some time all the powers were concentrated in the first Council Napoleon
 france ek deergh ashaanti se thak chukaa tha tathaa kranti ko sthapitv kii ore le jane ke liye antarkalin shanti param aavashyak thi
 But before the peace was established, an Italian campaign was necessary to defeat Austria
 napolian ne 1800 i main italy kaa doosraa abhiyaan basant ritu main prarambh kiya tathaa merengo kii vijay praapt kar austria ko lunvil kii sandhi ke liye vivash kar diya, jisamen pehle kii campoformiyon kii sari sharten doharaai gai
 Now the second bloc broke out and Napoleon made a treaty of Amiens from England in 1801 AD, under which the two nations returned each other's conquered territories
 ab nepolian ne ek sudhaar yojana karyanvit kar france ko shashan or vyavastha di
 Disciplined the economic condition of France
 shiksha paddati main abhootpurv parivartan kiye
 Strengthened the land system
 paris kaa saundaryikaran kiya
 Made considerable changes in the army and gave a scientific basis to the French system, which is still known as the Napoleonic Code
 pope se ek con courdet kar catholic jagat kaa samarthan praapt kar liya
 Napoleon achieved considerable success with these reforms and in March 1804 he became the Emperor of France
 is ghatana se saare europe main ek halchal paidaa hui
 Again the war between France and Britain began to cloud
 napolian ne england par akraman karne ke liye uttari samudri tat par bolon main apni sena bheji
 England awakened to the north of its naval contingent on the English Channel and then surprised Napoleon at every encounter
 aamiain kii sandhi ke samaapt hote hi wiliam pit shashan main aayaa or usne england, austria, yas aadi rashtron ko milakar ek tritiy gut banaaya
 Napoleon then barricaded against Austria and ended the Republic of Sisalpine and assumed the position of King of Italy himself
 austria ko ulm ke yuddh main haraaya
 Francis, the ruler of Austria, fled and took refuge in the Tsar
 idhar trafalgar ke yuddh main nelson ne napolian kii jalsena ko haraa diya tha, jisase austria ko phir se napolian ko chunauti dene kaa mauka mil gaya tha
 But when Austerlitz was defeated in the war, Austria had to accept a shameful treaty of the press class
 is safalataa se napolian kaa ullas bad gaya or ab usne germany ko raudna prarambh kiya
 He strengthened the rule of his brother Joseph Bonaparte by creating the Treaty of Rhine, defeating the wars of Jena and Arsed in 14 October 1806
 ab keval rus rah gaya jise napolian ne june 1807 i main freedland ke yuddh main haraakar july 1807 kii tilsit kii sandhi ke liye vivash kiya
 Once the master of all Europe, Napoleon waged an economic war to defeat England
 saare europe ke rashtron kaa vyapaar england se band kar diya tathaa europe kii sari seemaa par ek kathor niyantran lagu kiya
 Britain promulgated a prohibitive command to stop France's trade with the nations of Europe to its north
 britain ne apni kshatipurti upaneveshon se vyapaar badha kar kar lee, kintu europea rashtron kii aarthik sthiti bigadane lagi or ve france kii is yatnaa se peedit ho uthe
 Spain first revolted against this system
 parinamswaroop napolian ne spain par chadhaai kii or vahaan kii satta chin lee
 This sparked a national uprising in Spain
 nepolian isko dabaa bhi nahin paaya tha ki use austria ke vidroh ko dabaanaa padaa or phir kram se prasha or rus ne bhi is vyavastha kii avagya kii
 Russia's rebellion proved disastrous for Napoleon
 uske moscow abhiyaan kii barbaadi itihaas main prasiddh ho gayi he
 Upon returning to Paris, Napoleon again collected an army, but was again defeated at Leipzig by the united armies of Prussia, Russia and Austria
 chaaron ore rashtriya sangram chhid jane se vah sakriy rup se kisi ek raashtra ko na dabaa sakaa tathaa 1814 i main alba dweep bhej diya gaya
 The Allied forces were not able to return even after it was reported that Napoleon's century-long rule began
 at: mitra rashtron ne use 1815 main waterlu ke yuddh main haraakar saint helena kaa karawas diya
 He died there on May 5 in 1821
 nepolian bonapart ne 1799 main satta ko haathon main lekar apni sthiti sudrudh karne tathaa france ko prashasnic sthayitv pradaan karne ke liye vibhinn kshetron main sudhaar kiye
 In fact, the Nepalese had taken over power by ending the rule of the directory and the people of France had accepted that change, then the reason was that it had grown from chaos and chaos
 atah nepolian ke liye yah jaruri tha ki vah aantarik kshetra main ek suvyavasthit shashan or kanoon vyavastha kii sthapana kare
 After becoming First Counsel, Napoleon created a new Constitution for France which was the fourth constitution of the Revolution era
 iske dwaara karypalika shakti teen kanusalaron main nihit kar di gai
 The Principal Counsel had more power than other Counselors
 vastav main samvidhan main ganatantr kaa dikhaaya to jarur tha lekin rajya kii sampoorn satta nepalian ke haathon main kendrit thi
 Napoleon centralized the governance and abolished the local governments of the Departments and Districts and appointed the prefects and sub-prefects
 inaki niyukti tathaa gaanv or shaharon ke sabhi meyaron kii niyukti sidhe kenndriya sarkaar dwaara kii jane lagi
 In this way, Napoleon, the administration's field, kept adequate control over these officers and kept the administration in order and appointed them on the basis of merit
 prashasnic kshetron main nepolian ke sudhaar ek prakaar se kranti ke virdohi ke rup main the kyonki neshnal essembali ne kranti ke dauraan prashasnic dhaanche kaa purna vikendrikaran kar diya tha tathaa desh kaa shashan chalaane kaa daayitv nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko diya gaya tha lekin nepalian ne is vyavastha ko ulat diya or krantipurv vyavastha ko phir se sthapit kiya
 From that point of view he was a laughingstock of revolution
 nepolian ne france kii jarjar aarthik sthiti se use ubaarane kaa praytn kiya
 In this sequence, he first simplified the tax system
 kar vasuulne kaa kaary kendriya karmchaariyon ke jimme kiya tathaa uski vasuuli sakhti se kii jane lagi
 He prohibited unfair profits in bribery, betting, contracting
 usne mitvyayita par bal diya or france kii janata par anek apratyaksh kar lagaae
 Napoleon established the Bank of France to carry out the financial activities in France, which still exists today
 rashtriya rin ko chukaane ke liye usne ek pruthak kosh kii bhi sthapana kii
 As far as possible Napoleon put the burden of military expenditure on the conquered territories and tried to keep the French people free from this burden
 nepolian ne krishi ke sudhaar par bhi bal diya or banjar or retile ilaake ko upjau banane kii yojana banaai
 Napoleon paid considerable attention to the means of transport for the development of trade
 sadaken, naharen banavaai gai vibhinn prakaar ke vyavsaayon kii pragati ke liye yantric shiksha kii vyavastha kii
 To popularize French industrial goods, the exhibition of exhibitions was encouraged and encouraged indigenous goods and industries
 berogari kii samasya ko dur karne ke liye nirmaan kaary ko protsaahan diya
 In this way Napoleon recovered France from a state of shabby and insolvency
 kintu aarthik sudhaaron kii drushti se bhi nepolian ke kaary kranti virdohi dikhaai dete hai
 In the Revolution, emphasis was placed on direct taxes, while Napoleon tried to establish an archaic system by emphasizing indirect taxes
 isi prakaar nepolian ne vanijyivaadee darshan ko praathamikta dekar krantivirdohi maansikta kaa pradarshan kiya
 He believed that the state would have to take active intervention to bring balance between the security of the fund and trade, whereas the force of revolution was on free trade
 nepalian aise nagarikon ko chahta tha jo uske evam uske tantra ke prati vishwaas rakhe
 For this, he made reforms by adopting national and secular forms of education
 shiksha ko praathmik, madhyamik or ucch staron par sangathit kiya
 These schools run with the help of teachers appointed by the government, used to have the same curriculum, the same textbooks and the same uniform
 nepolian ne paris main ek vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana kii or usamen latin, french, vigyaan, ganit ityadi vishyon kii shiksha di jaati thi
 This university was not a university in the general sense of the university, but made a system to unite all the institutions from primary to higher education
 shiksha par adhikadhik sarkari niyantran rakhana tathaa vidhyaarthiyon ko shashan ke prati nishthavan bananaa iskaa uddeshy tha
 Napoleon founded the Institute of France for research work
 nepolian kii nari shiksha main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 The burden of their education was left to religious institutions
 france kii bahusankhyak janata catholic carch ke prabhaav main thi
 During the revolution, the power of the church was weakened and brought under the kingdom
 carch kii sampati kaa rashtriyakaran kar diya gaya or padariyon ko rajya kii vafadari kii shapath lene ko kaha gaya
 This angered the Pope and incited the general public to protest
 faltah sarkaar or aamajanata ke bich tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 Napoleon made a pact with the Pope from 1801 called Concardate to overcome it
 uske nimnlikhit praavdhaan the
 Napoleon's most important and permanent work was the creation of the Code of Law
 vastutah kranti ke pehle france kii kanoon vyavastha chhin-bhinn thi or itane prakaar ke kanoon the ki kanoon kaa paalan karaane waalon ko bhi unka gyaan nahin tha or kranti ke dauraan bhi yah araajaktaa bad gai thi
 Napoleon overcame this chaos
 swayan nepolian apni vidhi samhita ko apane 40 yudhon se adhik shaktishaalee maanata tha
 By this code Napoleon established the universal law system in France
 naagarik samhita ke tahat usne parivaar ke mukhiya kaa adhikaar sudrudh kiya
 Women are placed under men and the husband's job is to protect the wife
 talaak kii paddati ko kathin banaaya gaya
 Civil marriage was also arranged in this code
 is prakaar civil vivaah or talaak kii pratha ko manyata dekar nepolian ne europe main is baat kaa prachlan kiya ki bina padariyon ke sahyog ke bhi samaaj kaa kaam chal saktaa he
 Thus other codes such as the Code of Criminal Proc
 Etc
 were created
 uske vyapaarik code main shramjiviyon ke hiton kii upeksha kii gai thi or unke sanghon par pratibandh ko jari rakhaa gaya tha
 In this view Napoleon worked against the ideals of revolution
 iske baavjood is vidhi samhita kii mahatta samooche desh main kanoon kii ekarupata pradaan karne tathaa vyaavhaarik rup se nyaay vyavastha ko aasaan banane main thi
 This code was enforced wherever Napoleon's armies went and remained intact even after Napoleon's defeat
 yah nepolian kii ek sthaayee kirti he
 Napoleon's Code of Law emphasizes the interests of the bourgeoisie more
 bhoomi sambandhi adhikari ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyakti sampati kii raksha ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyaktigat sampati kii raksha ke liye kai kanoon banaae
 Creating a trade union was declared a crime
 mukademen kii sthiti main mazdooron kii daleelon ke badale maalikon kii baton ko nyaayalayon ko maanane ko kaha gaya
 Social equality is also the basis of the civil code
 visheshadhikaar or saamanti niyam kaa samhita main koi sthaan nahin tha
 There was not even a law to consider the elder son as the heir to the property, all the sons were given equal rights on the property
 nepolian ne samaaj main ek naveen kuleen varg kii sthapana kii
 He determined the order of titles according to income
 nepolian kaa yah kaary kranti ke aadarshon ke vipareet tha
 Napoleon's appearance on the European political horizon was like a wandering wheel and he soon became the destiny of Europe on the strength of his process and hard work
 usamen adbhut sainik tathaa prashasnic kshamta se sabhi kochakit kar diya
 But his pillar of strength was like standing on the sand wall
 jo kuch hi varshon main dhwast ho gaya vastut: nepolian kaa utthan or patan chakachaundh karne vaali ulka ke samaan hua
 He shone in the sky of Europe on the strength of military success, but with defeat, the star of his destiny sank
 jis samrajya kii kathin parishram ke pashchaat kaayam kiya gaya tha vah dekhte hi dekhte samaapt ho gaya uske patan ke anek kaaran the jo sa prakaar he
 Infinitely ambitious nepolian aseem mahatvakankshi tha
 The infinite great ambition proves to be the main cause of a person's downfall
 nepolian ke saath bhi yahi baat thi
 As the war progressed, his ambition increased and he began to dream of establishing a world state
 yadi thode se hi vah santusht ho jaataa or jite hue samrajya kii dekhbhaal karata or apana samay usamen lagaataa to use patan kaa durdasha nahin dekhnaa padataa
 Character weakness nepolian main saahas sanyam or dhairya kut- kut kar bharaa tha parantu uski drushti main ghrinaa uskaa pratishodh uskaa kartavya tathaa kshamaadaan kalank tha
 The great weakness of his character was that he did not consider the treaty to be a respected agreement
 kisi bhi desh kii maitri uske liye raajnneetik aavashyaktaa se adhik nahin thi
 Gradually he became stubborn
 He believed that every step of his was okay
 vah kabhi bhul nahin kar saktaa vah dusron kii salaah kii upeksha karne laga
 As a result, his true friends also went away from him
 nepolian kii vyavastha kaa sanyavad par aadhaarit hona- His political system was based on militarism which proved to be the primary cause of its downfall
 vah sabhi maamalon main sena par nirbhar rahata tha falat: vah hameshaa yuddh main hi ulajhaa rahaa
 He forgot that militarism can only be beneficial in times of crisis
 jab tak france vipattiyon ke badal chhaae rahe vahaan kii janata ne uskaa saath diya vipattiyon ke hatate hi janata ne uskaa saath dena chhod diya
 Losing the sympathy and love of the French public proved fatal to him
 uske atirikt parajeet raashtra uske shatru banate gaye jo avasar milte hi uske khilaaf uth khadey hue
 The historian Kabban has rightly written
 ‘nepolian kaa samrajya yuddh main panpa tha yuddh hi uske astitv kaa aadhaar tha or yuddh main hi uskaa ant hua
 ' doshapurn sainik vyavastha- Initially, the French army was steeped in the spirit of patriotism
 uske samaksh ek adarsh kaa or vah ek uddeshy kii purti ke liye yuddh karata tha
 But as his empire expanded, the national form of the army became legalized
 pehle uski sena main francisi sainik te parantu baad main usamen german italian purtegali or dach sainik shaamil kar liya gaya
 As a result, his army became the army of many states
 unke saamne koi adarsh or uddeshy nahin tha
 Hence, his military power continued to weaken and this proved to be an important reason for his downfall
 nausena kii durbalata- Napoleon had properly organized the army, but he lacked a powerful navy, which caused him to be defeated by England
 agar uske paas shaktishaalee nausena hoti to use england se parajeet nahin hona padataa
 Lack of patriotism in the conquered territories usne jin pradeshon par vijay praapt kii vahin kii janata ke hryday main uske prati sadbhaavna or prem nahin tha
 They hated Napoleon's rule
 jab uski shakti kamjor padane lagi to uske adhinsth rajya apni swatantraaa ke liye praytn karne lage
 The European nation formed a fourth bloc for the League against him and consequently was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo
 pope se shatruta- Due to the continental system, he made the Pope his enemy
 jab pope ne usee mahadwipiya vyavastha ko maanane se inkaar kar diya to usne april 1808 main rome par adhikaar kar liya
 And in 1809 AD, the Pope was imprisoned, leading Catholics to believe that Napoleon was the only demon destroying the freedoms of the states
 varanaa unka dharm nasht karne vaala bhi he
 industrial Revolution- kaha jaataa he ki uski paraaj waterlu ke maidan main na hokar manchester ke kaarkaanon or barkingdhan ke lohe ke bhadiyaan main hui
 As a result of the Industrial Revolution, large-2 factories were opened in England and England became prosperous upon seeing it
 falat: vah apni sena kii aadhunik hatyar se sampann kar sakaa jo nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Continental system mahadwipiya vyavastha uski jabardast bhul thi
 He considered England as his biggest enemy
 england kii shakti kaa mukhya aadhaar nausena or vishwavyaapee vyapaar ta uski nausakti ko nepolian samaapt nahin kar sakaa isliye uske vyapaar par aghat karne kii cheshtaa kii gai
 For this purpose, he gave birth to the continental system, he issued an order that no country can do trade with England
 or na to england kii bani hui vastu kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 This was Napoleon's terrible mistake
 is vyavastha ne use ek aise jaal main fasaa diya jisase nikalnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Therefore, the continental system is considered to be the main reason for its collapse
 purtegal ke saath yuddh – Purtigal had a commercial relationship with England, but Napoleon's pressure forced him to break ties with England
 isse purtegal ko kaaphi nuksaan hua
 Therefore, he again established a commercial relationship with England
 isapar nepolian ne krodhit hokar purtegal par akraman kar diya
 This too proved fatal for Napoleon
 spain ke saath sangharsh- Napoleon's third mistake was his interference in Spain's internal affairs
 iske lakhon sainik maare gaye
 As a result, his position in this war became absolutely weak
 jisase uske virodhiyon ko protsaahan mila jab nepolian ne apane bhai ko spain kaa raja banaaya to vahaan ke nivasee us videshi ko raja maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 He drove Napoleon's army from Spain
 us vidroh se anya deshon ko bhi protsaahan mila or ve bhi vidroh karne lage jisase uskaa patan avashyambhavi ho gaya
 Russia's campaign nepolian ne rus par akraman kar baari bhul kii rus ne isaki mahadwipiya vyavastha ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Napoleon attacked Russia at this
 isamen yaddhapi masco par iskaa aadhikaar ho gaya lekin use mahaan kshati uthaani padi
 His opponents planned to attack
 ise akraman main use parajeet hona padaa
 Fatigue anek yuddh main lagaataar vyast rahane ke kaaran vah thak chukaa tha 50 sailaaniyon ne likhaa he nepolian ke patan kaa samast kaaran ek hi shabd thakaan main nihit he
 As he got entangled in the war, as his power weakened, he became tired and due to this his downfall became necessary
 sagesambandhi- His immediate relatives were no less responsible for his downfall
 halanki vah apane sambandhiyon ke prati udaartaa kaa bartaav karata tha
 But whenever he was in trouble, his relatives did not help him
 chaturthgut ke sanghathan- Taking advantage of the weakness of Napoleon, his enemies formed the fourth faction and the Allies defeated him
 use pakad kar salbai bheja gaya or use vahaan kaa swatantra shaasha banaaya gaya lekin nepolian vahaan bahut dinon tak nahin rah sakaa vah sheeghra hi france laut gaya or vahaan kaa shaasha ban baitha
 But this time he remained the emperor for only a hundred days
 mitra rashtron ne 18 june 1815 i
 ko waterlu ke yuddh main antim rup se parajeet kar diya
 The captured Allies sent him as a prisoner to an island called St
 Helena where he died in 1821, at the age of 52 years
 is prakaar uparyukt sabhi kaaran pratyaksh evam apratyaksh rup se uske patan ke liye uttaradaayi the usne yuddh ke dwaara hi apane samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha or yudhon ke chalate hi uskaa patan bhi hua
 That is, those elements who built Napoleon's empire also destroyed them

 His tenure was from 1861 to 1865

 He overcame America with its biggest crisis - the Civil War
 america main das pratha ke ant kaa shrey linkan ko hi jaataa he
 Abraham Lincoln was born into a poor black family
 ve pratham republican the jo america ke raashtrapati bane
 Prior to that he was a lawyer, a member of the State of Illinois, a member of the House of Representatives of America
 ve do baar seenet ke chunaav main asafal bhi hue
 In terms of earning from advocacy, Abraham Lincoln practiced for twenty years before becoming the President of America
 lekin unki vakaalat se unhen or unke muvakkilon ko jitna santosh or maansik shanti mili vah dhan-daulat banane ke aage kuch bhi nahin he
 Hundreds of true stories of his advocacy days testify to his honesty and gentleness
 linkan apane un muvakkilon se adhik fees nahin lete the jo ‘unki hi tarah garib’ the
 Once one of his clients sent him twenty-five dollars, Lincoln returned ten dollars from him, saying that fifteen dollars was enough
 aamtaur par ve apane muvakkilon ko adaalat ke baahar hi rajinama karke maamla nipta lene kii salaah dete the taaki donon pakshon kaa dhan mukademebaaji main barbaad na ho jaye iske badalen main unhen na ke baraabar hi fees milti thi
 a pension agent was asking for $ 200 in fees to a widow of a martyred soldier for $ 400 of her pension
 linkan ne us mahila ke liye na keval muft main vakaalat kii balki uske hotel main rahane kaa kharchaa or ghar vaapasi kii tikat kaa intjaam bhi kiya
 Lincoln and one of his associate attorneys once sentenced a sly man who occupied the land of a mentally ill woman to court
 The case lasted only fifteen minutes in court
 After the winning of the associate lawyer, the division divided him into a fee
 sahyogi vakil ne kaha ki us mahila ke bhai ne puri fees chukaa di thi or sabhi adaalat ke nirnay se prasann the parantu linkan ne kaha – “lekin main khush nahin hoon! vah paisa ek bechaari rogi mahila kaa he or main aisa paisa lene ke bajaay bhukhe maranaa pasand karunga
 tum meri fees kii rakam use waapas kar do
” Thinking today, Lincoln was stupid
 unke paas kabhi bhi kuch bahutayat main nahin rahaa or isamen unheen kaa dosha tha
 But he was the best man among us, can anyone deny this? linkan kabhi bhi dharm ke bare main charchaa nahin karte the or kisi carch se sambaddh nahin the
 Once, one of his friends asked him about his religious views
 Lincoln said - "long ago i met an old man in Indiana who used to say 'when i do something good i feel good and when i do bad i feel bad'
" This is my religion '
 abraham linkan ne yah patr apane bete ke skool principal ko likhaa tha
 Lincoln had written all the things he wanted to teach his son
 sammanneey mahoday, main jaanata hoon ki is duniya main saare log achche or sachche nahin hai
 My son will also have to learn this
 par main chahta hoon ki aap use yah bataaen ki har bure aadmi ke paas bhi acha hriday hota he
 Every selfish leader has the ability to be a good leader
 main chahta hoon ki aap use sikhayen ki har dushman ke andar ek dost banane kii sambhaavna bhi hoti he
 It will take time to learn these things, i know
 par aap use sikhie ki mehnat se kamaaya gaya ek rupaya, sadak par milane vaale paanch rupye ke note se zyada keemtee hota he
 You will tell him not to bring jealousy from others
 saath hi yah bhi ki khulkar hanste hue bhi shaleenta baratna kitna jaruri he
 i hope you will be able to tell him that it is not a good thing to threaten and intimidate others
 yah kaam karne se use dur rahanaa chahie
 You will ask him to read books, but at the same time he will also remind the birds flying in the sky to see the butterflies hovering in the sun, flowers in the green fields
 main samajhataa hoon ki ye baaten uske liye zyada kaam kii hai
 i believe that he must also learn during school days that it is good to fail by copying and passing
 kisi baat par chaahe duusare use galat kahen, par apni sachhee baat par kaayam rahane kaa hunar usamen hona chahie
 Be gentle with kind people and be strict with bad people
 dusron kii sari baaten sunne ke baad usamen se kaam kii chizon kaa chunaav use inhen dinon main siikhnaa hoga
 Do not forget to tell him how sadness can be converted into happiness
 or use yah bhi bataaiega ki jab kabhi rone kaa man kare to rone main shame bilkul naa kare
 i think he should believe in himself and others
 tabhi to vah ek acha insaan ban paaegaa
 These things are big and long
 par aap inamen se jitna bhi use bataa paaen utana uske liye acha hoga
 Then my son is very young and very cute

 An graph is a graphical representation of data, in which "figures are represented by symbols, such as bars in a bar chart, as lines in a line chart, or as pieces in a pie chart"
 a chart displays tabular numeric figures, functions, or qualitative structures of some sort
 aankadon ke ek aalekhiy prastutikaran ke rup main "lekhachitr" shabd ke kai arth hai Charts are often used to understand excessive amounts of data and to know the relationships between parts of those figures

 agar ek kshaitij or ek anulamb aksh kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, to unhen aam taur par kramshah x-aksh or y-aksh ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Each axis will have a scale, marked by periodic chronology, and usually with numerical or explicit signs
 Each axis will typically have a label outside or next to it, which will briefly describe the displayed dimension
 If the scale is numeric, then the unit of scale will be in parentheses followed by the label
 For example, "distance traveled" is a typical x-axis label and would mean that the distance traveled in meters is related to the horizontal position of the figures
 graph ke bheetar, rekhaon kaa ek grid, aankadon ke drishy sanrekhan main sahaayta karne ke liye dikhaai de saktaa he

 The data in a chart can be presented in all forms of the format, with or without individual labels
 yah dot yaa akritiyon, sambaddh yaa asambaddh or rangon or pettern ke kisi bhi sangyojan main pradarshit ho sakate hai
 Estimates or points of interest can be represented directly on the graph to aid information extraction
 jab kisi chart main pradarshit aankadon main ekaadhik char hote hai, to chart main ek legend shaamil ho saktaa he
 a legend has a list of variables that are displayed in the chart and an example of their presence

 Its diameter is about 3,138 km which is only a few kilometers smaller than our moon
 europa ko angrezi main "europa" likhaa jaataa he
 According to ancient Greek sources, Europa was the name of a Phoenician royal woman
 europa mukhya rup se patthariile padaarthon kaa bana hua he or iskaa centre lohe kaa he
 Its surface is made up of water and is counted among the most flat surfaces of the entire solar system
 is sataha par daraaren to nazar aati hai lekin prahaar cretar bahut kam hai
 The cracks also appear to be filled with new snow
 sataha ko dekh kar bahut se vaigyanikon ko lagata he ke uske neeche zarur ek pani kaa samudr hoga
 Their thinking is that whenever the surface bursts due to a meteorite falling or it cracks due to the pull of Jupiter's tidal force, the hot ice that contacts the ocean water from below comes up and tightly heals the wound
 is
 agar vastav main aisa samudr he to sambhav he ke usamen jivan punap rahaa ho
 Due to this possibility, the Space Exploration Agencies of Europe and America are planning to do more research on Europa
 vaigyanik yah bhi anumaan lagate hai ke europa kii sakht barfili sataha arabon saal pehle hue apane nirmaan ke baad 80° gum chuki he
 This gives rise to the suspicion that the superficial ice shell is floating above a water sphere and can move freely
 anya vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ke aisa koi samudr nahin he or baahar kii sakht barf ke neeche keval naram barf he - lekin aisa vishwaas rakhane vaale vaigyanik alp sankhya main hai

 The number of this air is so low that the air pressure on the Earth is ten trillion times higher than Europa
 europa ke ird-gird antariksh se use gaur se dekhne ke liye yaan bhejne ke bahut se prastaav hai
 Apart from this, there is a proposal to land a vehicle on Europa
 is yaan main parmaanu shakti se garmi paidaa karne vaala ek bhaag hoga jo sataha kii barf ko pighalaakar europe main tab tak dhansata chalaa jayega jab tak ke vah yaa to samudr main pravesh kar le yaa phir yah sabit kar de ke aisa koi samudr he hi nahin
 Because scientists believe that the surface of the upper ice is more than 10 km thick, this vehicle will have to be sunk very deep to reach the sea
 yah bhi aavashyak hoga ke isaki prasaaran shakti bahut ho taaki barf kii itani gaharaai ke neeche se bhi vah sandesh or tasviren bhej sake
 This vehicle will also have such ability that it can roam in the ocean itself and can choose its direction because it will take few minutes to reach the directions from the earth
