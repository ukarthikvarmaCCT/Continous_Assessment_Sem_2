 The four types of tissues, cells and endothelial cells made by animals in the body are as follows: upakalaa utak kii rachana ek patali jhilli ke rup main hoti he, jo vibhinn sanrachanaon ke bahari sataha par aavaran ke rup main tathaa unki guhaaon evam naliyon main bhitari str ke rup main vartmaan rahati hai
 In addition, as a 'gland cell', it also participates in the formation of glands
 isaki utpatti bahya twachaa yaa antastvachaa se hoti he tathaa saadhaarant: isaki koshikaaye ek hi pankti main sthit rahati hai
 Such single-layer epithelium is called 'simple epithelium'
 parantu kabhi-kabhi isaki koshikaaye anek shaktiyon main baddh rahati hai, jinhen 'starit upakalaa' kehete hai
 The epithelium has a higher number of cells than other tissues

 The main types of simple epithelium are the sclera epithelium, columnar epithelium, glandular epithelium, cortical epithelium, sensory epithelium, pigment epithelium and embryonic epithelium
 sanyoji utak main antarkoshikeey dravya adhik hote hai
 The main function of this tissue is to support other tissues and combine them

 These cells are contractile, giving the fibers the ability to expand and contract
 iske teen prakaar hote hai- Unstretched muscle - It is also called involuntary muscle, because its action is not dependent on the desire of the animal

 Many types of instruments are used for this purpose, such as X-ray units, 'absorption microscope', 'electron microscope', 'polarization microscope', 'dark field microscope', 'ultraviolet microscope', Visible light microscope, ' Phase contrast microscope, 'interference microscope' and 'descending microscope' etc

 Subsequently, the 'microtome' was invented, with the help of which thin sections can be cut into thicknesses of 1 'mu'
 ab to 1 'mu' se bhi adhik patale khand kaate ja sakate hai
 Around the time the use of 'microtome' began, around the same time, many types of permanent tax chemists were also invented for 'preservation' and size retention of tissues

 As a result, the study of re-innovation started in a completely controlled state and many new experiments under histology took place, for example 'tissue culture', 'micromanipulation', 'micro cinematography', inter-biodegradable staining and occupational staining
 , In addition, freezing and drying operations were also used for the prevention of havoc

 hoper gubbaaraa garm hawa se udne vaala ek chota, ek vyakti kii kshamta vaala gubbaaraa hota he
 While traditional hot air balloons have a basket for people to stand, there is no such basket in a hopper balloon
 iske bajaae hoper payalat aamtaur par ek kursi par baithta he yaa saaj pahentaa he jo parachute jaisaa hota he
 Hoppers usually fly for entertainment
 in vimaanon ko kabhi-kabhaar "badal hopers" yaa "cloudeoper" bhi kaha jaataa he
 However, the name is formally used to refer to products from a particular manufacturer, particularly Lindstrand Baluns
 phir bhi, bahut log vyapak trademark ke taur par ise "cloudeoper" naam se hi pukaarte hai jiskaa matlab is tarah ke sabhi vimaan hote hai
 The hopper is a broad terminology in more careful use
 zyaadaatar hoper gubbaaron main aavaran hote hai jinaki maatra hoti he14,000 se 35,000 ghan foot or jinaki adhiktam udaan kshamta ek se dedh ghante hoti he
 The two main commercial balloon manufacturers currently producing hopper balloons are Cameron Balloon and Lindstrand Balloon
 iske alaava zyaadaatar hoper gubaare prayogtmak vimaan hai jinhen shaukia nirmaataa taiyaar karte hai
 Balloon jumping began as a sport after 1924 in the United States and 1927 in England
 kai utsaahi logon ke liye gubaare se chalaang lagane kaa matlab vastav main chalaang lagaana hi hota he: udaan bharne ke liye aparyaapt oochaal hone par gubaare main savaar vyakti ko asal main apni mansapeshiyon se gubaare kii sahaayta lekar kudana padataa he
 Helium is most preferred in the United States as a blowing gas because it is safe from fire, it also gives the person in the balloon a chance to smoke while flying; Elsewhere hydrodon gas was common but not hot air-blowing balloons
 hoper gubaare yaa chalaang lagane vaale gubaare ek air bag or ek aadim takht ke saath ek nilamban gofan se zyada kuch bhi nahin hota he, inkaa istemaal vishaal hawaii pot or samtap mandal gubbaaron ke sanchaalak vimaanon kii satahon kii jaanch or marammat ke liye ek saste saadhan ke taur par karte the
 The device was also quite convenient because the safe place to launch high-altitude balloons was located in a far distance where there were no real airport facilities
 ek udhaaharan, jab georgy prokofiv ke manahuus USSR-3 ko duusari baar launch kiya gaya tha tab vishaal gubaare ke upar uljhe hue jaal ko do hoper gubbaaron ne suljhaayaa tha: pehla jampar takht se gir gaya tha lekin wo gubaare ke taron ko pakad kar khud ko bachaane main kaamyaab rahaa tha
 The first modern hot air balloon was flown by Ed Yost on 22 October 1960 in Bruning, Nebraska under the sponsorship of the United States Naval Research Office
 chunki yost ke gubaare kaa chota aavaran 31,000 ghan feet tha or payalat ke liye tokari kii jagah ek kursi thi, isliye aisa mana jaataa he ki ye 1930 ke dashak ke hawaii poton ke swarna yug ke baad udne vaala pehla hoper gubbaaraa tha
 The cloudhopper is often named for a one-person hot air balloon in which the pilot sits on an instrument or small chair
 payalat ke peeche aksar propen kii ek tank hoti he or payalat ke sir ke upar ek frem main burner laga hota he
 The balloon burner, tank and pilot equipment can be used independently of the balloon cover so that the pilot can guide and land the balloon as needed during the flight
 "cloudeoper" shabd kaa sabase pehle britani gubbaraakaar colin prescot ne istemaal kiya or iskaa trademark karaayaa
 cloudeoper ke vikaas ko 1979 main colt baluns ke per lindustrand ne aage badhaayaa
 baad main colt baluns kaa thunder baluns main vilay ho gaya or thunder and colt baluns kii sthapana hui jisane cloudeoper naam ko viraasat main le liya
 Finally Per Lindstrand left Thunder and Colt to establish his Lindstrand Balloon which produces the Cloudhopper of today
 colt kii team ke apane pehle cloudeoper ke banane or udaan bharne ke turant baad cameron baluns bhi apane backpac-style ke gubaare ke saath saamne ai, jiskaa naam skyhoper diya gaya
 The main distinguishing feature in this was that twist-grip was built to control the burner
 asli colt cloudeoper ke saath-saath aadhunik yug ke cloudeoper dizin main burner niyantrak niyamit yatriyon kii pheri karne vaale hot air gubaare kii tarah burner ke neeche laga hota he

 While learning Japanese, he created several grammar and dictionaries of Middle Japanese
 1603-1604 shabdkosh vocabelario da lingoa di ipam main japan ke liye do pravishtiyaan hai: niphone or ypon
 The title of the dictionary shows that the Portuguese word for Japan was ipam at that time

 Originally *, it weakened and eventually became modern
 aadhunik / ech / abhi bhi main uccharan hota he jab / ɯ / ke baad ise bolaa jaataa he
 The Middle Japanese niphon regularly becomes the modern Japanese nihon through phonetic changes

 In it, / zi / is written as either e or g
 aadhunik hepabern style main, epon ko jippon ke rup main prastut kiya jayega
 There are no historical phonetic changes to note here
 vyutpann rup se, jippan nippon ke samaan he ki yah 日本 kaa ek vaikalpik pathan he
 The initial character can also be read as / ziti / or / zitu / 
 / hon / ke saath mishrit, yah niyamit rup se jippon ban jaataa he
 Unlike the Nihon / Nippon doublets, there is no evidence for * Jihon
 japan ke japani naam "日本", nihon yaa nippon kaha ja saktaa he
 Both come from Onyomi
 日 kaa matlab he "surya" yaa "din"; 本 kaa matlab he "aadhaar" yaa "mul"
 Combined it means "origin of the sun" or "where the sun rises"

 Among the compounds, however, the last voiceless stop of the first word in Central Chinese was abrogated, and this type of pronunciation was nippon or zippon
 japani main aitihaasik dhwani parivartan ne alag-alag paatro ke aadhunik uccharan ko nichi or hon ke rup main janm diya he
 The pronunciation Nihon probably originated in the Kanto region as a reproduction of this independent pronunciation of 本 in the compound

 The Japanese government certainly rejected several attempts to determine official reading, which confirmed both to be correct
