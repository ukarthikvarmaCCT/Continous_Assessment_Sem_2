 Richards' counties career is also amazing, he played many memorable innings for the English County Somerset and played an important role in helping the team achieve success

 haalanki club main unke totum upasthiti ke baavjood 1985 or 1986 main wo kuch khaas nahin kar sake, yahi vajah he ki katri championships main unki team nichle paaydaan par pahunch gai
 Captain Peter Reebok's decision not to extend the contract of Richard and partner Geol Garner for the 1987 season led Somerset not to pursue his and Geol Garner's contract, whose runs and wickets helped the county great success in the prior eight years Was found county ne unke sthaan par newzealand ke martin kro ko anubandhit kiya, is faisale se naaraaz hokar ian batham ne bhi summersat se apana qaraar aage nahin badhaayaa or vorecestershire main shaamil ho gaye
 Somerset realized his mistake after Reebuck left, later the county honored the legendary player by dedicating Country Stadium, an entrance to Taunton and a stand to Richards

 He returned to the county for the 1990 season and signed with Glamorgan and played for the same club until the end of his career, during which Glamorgan won the AXA Sand League in 1993
 apni aakraamak style ke baavjood richards ek sidwantvaadi insaan the, yahi kaaran tha ki 1983 or 1984 main unhone baagi westeindies team ke saath dakshin africa jane se inkaar kar diya, aayojak is daure ke liye unhe blank check tak dene ko taiyaar the, lekin unhone ye prastaav thukraa diya

 pashuprajnan ke vyapak arth ke antargat pashuon ke utpaadan, unke paalanposhan tathaa dekhbhaal sambandhi sabhi prakaar ke kaary aate hai, kintu simit arth main is shabd kaa prayog praaia: pashuon kii anuvanshikta main aise sudhaar karne se he jisase manushya kii aavashyaktaa tathaa icchaanukool unnat prakaar ke pashu uplabdh ho saken
 Animals can be improved in two ways: pratham unke vaataavaran main sudhaar karne se tathaa doosraa unki anuvanshikta main sudhaar karne se
 Improving only one of these two cannot make proper progress
 vaataavaran main sudhaar karne se pashusankhya main parivartan praaia: bahut sheeghra hota he, kintu vah parivartan sthaayee nahin hota or tabhi tak rahata he jab tak nai paristhiti bani rahati he
 But by improving the genetics of an animal community, the change is usually slow, but it is permanent
 prarambh main pashuprajnak pashuon ke aise samooh ko, jinhen ve anya pashuon se shreshth samajhate the, alag kar lete the
 Then they used to choose the best ones in them
 is prakaar ke chayan se samooh main kuch aise bhi pashu nikal aate the jinamein pashuprajnan ke manovanchit kun vidyaman hote the
 Now the animals which they liked to breed were chosen as the father of the second generation and this method was adopted from generation to generation
 pashupaalak is bhanti avaanchit tatwon ko nikaalata jaataa or vaanchit gunonvale pashuon kii vruddhi par jor detaa jaataa tha
 Three things are required under any animal breeding program: kisi bhi prajnan-kaarykram ke antargat pehla kadam yah nirdhaarit karnaa hota he ki prajnak kaa lakshya kya he kya vah bazaar main bechney ke liye pashuon ke utpaadan main vruddhi karnaa chahta he, athwa vanaspatik sadhano ko pashutpadit vastuon main badalanaa chahta he, athwa kisi vishesh jalwaayu ke anukool pashu taiyaar karnaa chahta he ityadi
 It may be beneficial to follow two different types of animals of the same race for two different purposes in the same farm, some for horse-drawn carriage, some for riding, some animals for meat production, some for rearing For milk production
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki ek hi prakaar ke pashu main vibhinn gunon kaa sammishran ho, jisase ek hi pashu se do vibhinn aavashyaktaaon kii purti ho sake
 Assessing the qualities of each animal is the second step under the breeding program
 varan prajnan kaarykram ke antargat teesraa kadam he, jisamen is baat kaa aganan kiya jaataa he ki uplabdh jaanwaron main se prayek main kis had tak vaanchit gunon ko utpann karne tathaa unke upyog karne, yaa tyaagane, kii anuvanshikta vidyaman he
 Separating animals according to these qualities is called selection or selection
 varan teen prakaar kaa hota hai : Selecting animals for breeding solely on the basis of their individual traits
 Group selection, selection of them based on the traits of ancestors and endowments, and evaluating the reproductive qualities of an animal based on the quality of lineage and total selection and progeny is called progeny test
 is
 yadi in teenon prakaar ke varanon kii aapas main tulana karen, to inamen se prayek ke apane apane gundosh hai
 When certain inherited traits are very hereditary, then these symptoms appear in the average child just like the mother, but the symptoms when they are less hereditary are smaller in the average child than the family from which the parents were selected
 Properties will appear in samooh varan dwaara unnati varan kii tivrata or janak ke kul ke ausat hraas par nirbhar karti he
 The group makes the first more obvious change in the animal, but later the speed slows down and the effect is not great
 "samooh varan" dwaara jitna lakshya praapt kiya ja saktaa he utana parivaar varan dwaara nahin, kintu isse duusari peedi kii santan main janak kii ausat vilakshantaa se, neeche hraas nahin hota
 Family selection, especially for traits that are genetic in small amounts, or that cannot be determined separately in individual animals, or that are sometimes found in females or in males, or for determination of longevity when Till a creature is not particularly mature or old, it is not clear that it is useful
 sahi parivaar varan ke liye Number of families is large parivaar ke sadasyon main bilkul nikat kaa sambadh ho or Each of the families to be compared must have grown up in the same situation and environment
 ghodon,bakrii ,bhedon tathaa anya maweshiyon main, jinamein ek hi maan baap se utpann santati bahut kam hoti hai, parivaar varan adhik mahatv kaa nahin hota
 When the animal remains a child, only then its qualities have to be seen and then the child's selection is beneficial
 kintu bachche nimna koti kii anuvanshikta ke hote hai, athwa inamen kisi ek hi ling kii visheshta hoti he
 The following points are necessary for the correct child test: isamen sabhi santaanen, yaa kam se kam jin chune gaye namoonay bhi, samavisht kiye jaayen, Secondly, the qualities which the children have acquired from the parents, should be passed on to them, or they should be evaluated with proper accuracy and jinaki tulana kii ja rahi ho, ve sabhi santati ek hi prakaar ke vaataavaran main pali hon
 For detailed article, see - Artificial semen nar kaa shukr lekar bina prakritik sambhog ke maadaa kii yoni yaa garbhashay main sthapit karne kaa kaary bahut varshon se prayogshaalaon main, visheshat: ashvaprajnan main, napunsakata kaa saamana karne ke liye hota rahaa he
 But its extensive use on other farm animals was first developed by Russian activists in the early 20th century, in other countries it was also adopted, especially for dairy cattle
 kritrim viryasechan ke liye nar ko kisi kathputli maadaa ke saath maithun karakar, yaa nar ke ling kaa gharshan kar, veery ko skhlit karakar ikattha kar liya jaataa he
 Now the semen is mixed with the appropriate solution and egg yolks and diluted, so that many females can be conceived with only one time of ejaculated semen
 is tanukrut veery ko nimna taap par rakhkar anek dinon tak garbhashay ke yogya rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The offspring produced by artificial uterus are similar to those produced by natural intercourse
 kritrim viryasechan se prayek pashupaalan ko saand rakhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or is prakaar vah saand rakhane kii kathinaayee or kharche se batch jaataa he
 The cost of artificial insemination may be more or less than that of natural conception
 kritrim viryasechan karaane kaa kaary ek aise prashikshit vyakti dwaara, jo ki prajnan kii trutiyon ko pahachaanata or unka upachaar karata ho, kiya jaataa he
 This leads to good reproductive health
 kritrim viryasechan kaa vyay kam pade, iske liye pashupalkon kaa kritrim viryasechan sansthaaon ke saath sahyog karnaa aavashyak he
 After choosing the special males and females to become parents, the second step is to decide which female to associate with which female
 yadi pashupaalak kii koi nishchit niti nahin he, to janak or janani bananevaale puure samooh ke antargat hi kisi maadaa ke saath kisi bhi nar kaa sangam karaayaa jaataa he
 If the pair is selected on the basis of their mutual relationship, then the pairing may range from inbreeding to the possible mate breeding of the entire group of parents
 sangam kii ye paddatiyaan milaai ja sakati hai, yaa unamem her pher kiya ja saktaa he or chayan ke vibhinn tareekon ke saath vyavhaar main laayaa ja saktaa he
 In this way many types of breeding schemes can be made possible
 sangam kii paddatiyaan swayan kisi pitru jin ko bahush: ghatman yaa adhik viral nahin banaati, kintu ye pitru jin ke vibhinn sanyojanon ke anupaat main avashya hi parivartan laa detii hai or jansankhya kii parivartita ko badal de sakati he, jisase chayan yadi sangam kii aniyamit vidhi se hota he, to adhik prabhavakaari ho saktaa he
 Sangam in close relatives is called inbreeding
 is paribhaashik shabd kaa prayog unke liye kiya jaataa he jinamein yugma ke nar or nari kaa paraspar sambadh kam se kam chachere yaa mausere kaa ho
 Proximal inbreeding results in clear and rapid
 madhyam ant:prajnan anek pidiyon tak kiya jaae to prabhavakaari ho saktaa he
 The major effect of inbreeding is to increase homozygosity and to divide the breed into clear and unrelated families
 ant:prajnan jyon jyon aage badhata chalata he prayek parivaar apane hi antargat adhik samayugmak or anya pariwaron se bhinn ho jaataa he
 This increases the probability of effective selection among families
 samayugmajata main vruddhi adhik vyashtiyon main uttarottar gunon ko utpann karti he
 Since the ineffective property is often much less preferred than the effective, it usually results in some average degradation of the individual's properties, as it exposes undesired ineffective properties
 jab ant: kintu asambadhit vyashtiyon kaa sankaran karaayaa jaataa he tab mul pashudhan kii apeksha santan main praaia: adhik jeevanshkti pradarshit hoti he
 In this way, there is usually an immediate loss from inbreeding, but in the course of time, the intergenerational lineage chosen is mutually interchanged, then there is a benefit
 kisi spishiz kii kinhin vishesh trutiyon ko dur karne yaa varnsankarta ke oj or kisi vaanchit gunon kaa samavesh karaane ke liye aise jode chune jate hai jinamein yathasambhav aapas main kisi prakaar kaa sambadh na rahaa ho
 The offspring resulting from the heterogeneity of different breeds, or different species of the same species, often exhibit exceptional growth and high vitality
 jab is pratham peedi ke varnsankaron kaa paraspar prajnan karaayaa jaataa he, tab varnsankarta ke oj kaa praaia: hraas ho jaataa he
 The best example of outbreeding is mule

 ramchandra shukla ne hindi sahitya kaa itihaas main likhaa he : Shyam Sundar Das was not only an institute-maker, but was also unmatched in management
 sahitya ke samast kshetron ke abhaavon ko dur karne ke liye unhone sankalpabaddh hokar shram kiya
 Due to his achievements as a language philosopher or as a lecturer of the principles, literary literature remained a destiny of Hindi students for a long time
 inke man main yah dharna nirbhaant rahi ki hindi kii saidhantik samiksha kaa aadhaar sanskrit or pashchimi aalochana-siddhanton ko mila kar or unhen ek khaas saamanjasy ke saath hi banaaya janaa chahie
 Prior to Shyam Sundar Das there was a particularly critical time for Hindi and Nagari script
 pratap narayan mishra ne kai sthanon par hindi ke prachaar ke liye sabhaayen sthapit kii thim
 One such meeting was established in 1884 in Prayag under the name of 'hindi Savarni Pratik Madhya Bharat Sabha'
 sarkari dacrataron main nagari ke pravesh ke liye bhaaratendu harishchandra ne bhi kai baar udhyam kiya, par unhen safalataa nahin mil saki
 Despite this, the effort continued
 adalati bhashaa urdu hone ke kaaran navshikshiton main urdu padhane waalon kii sankhya adhik thi, jisase hindi pustakon ke prakaashan kaa kaary aage nahin bad paata tha
 In addition to this literature-crisis, the entry of Nagari into the government offices was a grave crisis in front of people who knew it
 isi daur main kuch utsaahi chaatro ke udyog se, jinamein babu shyaam sundar das pramukh the, 1893 main kaashi nagari prachaarini sabha kii sthapana kii gayi
 Here too, remember the statement of Ramchandra Shukla that, 'tell me the truth, all the prosperity and fame of this gathering is the fruit of Babu Shyam Sundar Das's sacrifice and continuous hard work

 In ancient times, there were two pillars of social order - varna and ashram
 manushya kii prakruti-gun, karm or swabhaav-ke aadhaar par maanavmaatr kaa vargeekaran chaar varno main hua tha
 For personal rites his life was divided into four ashramas
 ye chaar ashram the- Brahmacharya, Garhastya, Vanaprastha and Sannyas
 amarkosh par tikaa karte hue bhanu ji dikshit ne 'ashram' shabd kii vyakhya is prakaar kii he: ashramyantyatra
 Anen wa shramu tapasi
 Hours yadwa aa samantachhramotra
 Dogma arthath jisamen smyak prakaar se shram kiya jaae vah ashram he athwa ashram jivan kii vah sthiti he jisamen kartavyapaalan ke liye purna parishram kiya jaae
 The ashram also means 'special state', 'place of rest', 'holy place for sages to live'
 ashramasanstha kaa pradurbhaav vaidic yug main ho chukaa tha, kintu uske viksit or drudh hone main kaaphi samay laga
 In Vedic literature, there is no mention of celibacy and free development of ghasthaya or garhapatya
 in donon kaa sanyukt astitv bahut dinon tak bana rahaa or inako vaikhanas, parvrat, yeti, muni, shraman aadi se abhihit kiya jaataa tha
 Due to the predominance of karma and ritual in the Vedic period, there was no special encouragement for retirement or retirement
 vaidic sahitya ke antim charan upanishdon main nivritti or sanyas par jor diya jane laga or yah sweekaar kar liya gaya tha ki jis samay jivan main utkar vairaygy utpann ho us samay se vairaygy se prerit hokar sanyas grahan kiya ja saktaa he
 Nevertheless, there was a sense of neglect and disrespect towards sannyas or shramana dharma
 sutrayug main chaar ashramon kii parigananaa hone lagi thi, yadhyapi unke namkram main ab bhi matbhed tha
 According to Aapastamb Dharmasutra, there were four ashrams namely, Ghasthaya, Acharyakul, Maun and Vanaprastha
 gautamadharmasutra main brahmacharee, grihasth, bhikshu or vaikhanas chaar ashram batalaaye gaye hai
 In the Vasisthadharmasutra the householder, Brahmachari, Vanaprastha and Parvrajak, have described these four ashrams, but in relation to the ascendancy of the ashram, it is said that the last two ashrams were differentiated by the asura named Kapil, son of Prahlada, that the deities had an attainable share of yagnas
 Do not meet and they become weak
 iskaa sambhavat: yah arth ho saktaa he ki kaayakleshpradhan nivrittimarg pehle asuron main prachlit tha or aaryo ne unase is maarg ko anshat: grahan kiya, parantu phir bhi ye ashram unako puure pansad or grahya na the
 Buddhist and Jain reformers did not oppose the ashram, but did not accept the imperative of the first two ashrams - Brahmacharya and Garhastha
 iske falswaroop muni athwa yativritti ko bada protsaahan mila or samaaj main bhikshuon kii aganit vruddhi hui
 This has weakened the society, corruption also increased due to immature retirement or renunciation
 isaki pratikriya or pratisudhaaran i
 pus
 duusari sadi athwa shungavansh kii sthapana se hui
 The complete urge and composition of Ashram Dharma is seen in the memories of Manu etc
 puure ashramadharm kii pratishtha or unke kram kii anivaaryta bhi sweekaar kii gai
 Manu reinforced the principle of 'ashramat Ashram Gachchet', that is, one should go from one ashram to another
 smritiyon main chaaron ashramon ke kartavyon kaa vistrut varnan miltaa he
 Assuming human age as one hundred years, Manu has divided it into four equal parts
 pratham chaturthaansh brahmacharya he
 In this ashram it is the duty to observe celibacy by staying in the gurukula
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy vidya kaa uparjan or vraat kaa anushthan he
 Manu described Brahmachari's life and his duties in detail
 brahmacharya upanayan sanskaar ke saath prarambh or samaavartan ke saath samaapt hota he
 After this, by marrying, the munush enters the second ashram in the household
 garhasthya samaaj kaa aadhaar stambh he
 Just as all living beings live from the ashram of Vayu, similarly all other ashrams remain present with the help of householder ashram
 is ashram main manushya rishirin se veda se swadhyay dwaara, devrin se yajna dwaara or pitrurin se santanotpatti dwaara mukt hota he
 In the same way, through the rituals of daily panchamahayagna-brahmayagya, Devyagya, Atithya and Bhootya-yajna, he performs his duties towards the society and the world
 manusmritti ke chaturth evam pancham adhyay main grihasth ke karttavyon kaa vivechan paaya jaataa he
 The second quarter of the age, when a man spends his life, sees that his head hair is turning white and wrinkles are on his body, then he enters the third ashram of life - Vanaprastha
 
 This is the first phase of the retirement route
 isamen tyaag kaa aanshik paalan hota he
 Man gets away from active life, but the original wife of his household stays with him and he also follows Yajnadi householder religion partially
 parantu sansar kaa kramash: tyaag or yatidharm kaa prarambh ho jaataa he 
 In the vicinity of Vanaprastha, the ecosystem of a calm, mature man begins
 
 As written earlier, Manu arranges sannyas only after following the first three ashrams and his duties: going from one ashram to another ashram, being rested from Jitendriya, begging, Balivaishdev, etc
, who attains sannyas in death
 After attaining salvation, he makes his ultimate progress
 jo sab praaniyon ko abhaya dekar ghar se prvrajit hota he us brahmavaadi ke tej se sab lok aalokit hote hai 
 Realizing that a lonely man gets liberation, the sannyāsī would be alone, without any helpers, for the attainment of accomplishment; Thus neither does he leave anyone nor is he released from anyone
 kapaal khaane ke liye, vrikshamul rahane ke liye tathaa sabhi praaniyon main samta vyavhaar ke liye mukt purush ke lakshan hai 
 Where the physical and social basis of the ashram system is there, it also has its spiritual or philosophical basis
 bhartiya manishiyon ne maanav jivan ko keval pravaah na maanakar usko soddeshy mana tha or uskaa dhyey tathaa gantavy nishchit kiya tha
 To make life meaningful, he conceived four Purusharthas - Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha
 pratham teen purusharth sadhanrup se tathaa antim sadhyrup se vyavasthit tha
 Moksha was the ultimate Purushartha, that is, the ultimate goal of life, but it cannot be achieved by accident or imagination
 uske liye sadhana dwaara kramash: jivan kaa vikaas or paripakvata aavashyak he
 For this purpose Indian sociologists arranged ashram institution
 ashram vastav main jeev kaa shikshanalay athwa vidhyalay he
 The Brahmacharya Ashram has a secluded practice of religion
 brahmacharee pushtasharir, balishthabuddhi, shantman, sheel, shraddha or vinay ke saath yugon se uparjit gyaan, shaastra, vidya tathaa anubhav ko praapt karata he
 Only good and holy spirit can be the path of salvation
 garhasthya main dharm purvak arth kaa uparjan tathaa kaam kaa seven hota he
 In the world, the role of renunciation and renunciation is presented only after the acquisition of meaning and work and the experience of consumption
 sanyampurvak grahan ke bina tyaag kaa prashn uthta hi nahin
 Vanaprastha is ready
 sanyas ke sabhi bandhanon kaa tyaag kar purnat: mokshadharm kaa paalan hota he
 Thus the ashram was a fully liberal but restrained planning of life in the institution
 shastron main ashram ke sambandh main kai drushtikon paae jate hai jinako teen virgo main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Aggregates, Options and Constraints
 samucchy kaa arth he sabhi ashramon kaa samuchit samaahaar, arthath chaaron ashramon kaa kramash: or samuchit paalan hona chahie
 According to it, following the rules of Artha and Kama in Grihastrashrama is as important as the practice of Brahmacharya, Dharma in Vanaprastha and Sannyas, and observance of salvation-related religions
 is siddhant ke sabase bade pravartak or samarthak manu hai
 The second principle option means that after the Brahmacharya Ashram, the person has the freedom to make the choice whether to enter the Gharshitha Ashram or to take renunciation directly
 samaavartan se sandarbh main brahmacharee do prakaar ke bataae gaye hai
 Upakurvaan, who wanted to end celibacy and enter into the Grihastrashrama and Naishtika, who wanted to practice celibacy by living in a lifelong gurukula
 isi prakaar striyon main brahmacharya ke pashchaat sadyodwaha or brahmavadini hoti thim
 This principle has been propounded in the Jabalopanishad and many Dharmasutras and certain memories
 baadh kaa arth he sabhi ashramon ke swatantra astitv athwa kram ko na maananaa athwa ashram sanstha ko hi na sweekaar karnaa
 It has been said in Gautama and Boudhayan Dharmasutras that the same ashram is indeed a health
 brahacharya uski bhoomika he:shwanprastha or sanyas mahatv main gaun hai
 Manu has also accepted the greatest importance of the family, which is the origin of all karma and ashramas
 is mat ke samarthak apane paksh main shatapath brahman kaa vaakya, ishopanishad kaa vaakya aadi udhrut karte hai
 The Karma Yoga of the Gita is also considered not to be the renunciation of karma but only the renunciation in karma
 ashram sanstha ko sabase badi baadha paramparavirohi buddha evam jain maton se hui jo ashramavyavastha ke samucchy or santulan ko hi nahin maanate or jivan kaa anubhav praapt kiye bina aparipakv sanyas yaa yatidhart ko atyadhik prashray dete hai
 Manu
 But while commenting, Sarvagyanarayana has tried to coordinate the above three views
 saamanyat: to unako samucchy kaa siddhant maanya he
 In the alternative, they consider rights discrimination unke vichaar main baadh kaa siddhant un vyaktiyon ke liye hi he jo apane purvasanskaron ke kaaran sansaarik karmon main aaajeevan aasakt rahete hai or jinamein vivek or vairaygy kaa yathasamay udai nahin hota
 a well organized ashram institution has its own specialty in India
 kintu iskaa ek bahut bada saarvbhaum or shastreey mahatv he
 Although there has been a difference in its ideals and behavior due to historical reasons, which is natural in view of human nature, yet its imagination and partial behavior keep gravity in themselves
 is vishay par doyson kaa nimnaankit mat ullekhneey he: manu tathaa anya dharamshastron main pratipaadit ashram kii prasthaapana se vyavhaar kaa kitna mail tha, yah kahana kathin he; kintu yah sweekaar karne main ham swatantra hai ki hamaare vichaar main sansar ke maanav itihaas main anyatra koi aisa nahin he jo is siddhant kii garima kii tulana kar sake

 Sogda, Sogdia or Sogdiana was an ancient civilization located in Central Asia
 yah aadhunik uzbekistan ke samarkand, bukhaaraa, khujand or shahar-e-sabz ke nagaron ke ilaake main faili hui thi
 The people of Sogda spoke a language called Sogdai which was the eastern Iranian language and became extinct with time

 When the Greek forces led by Alexander the Great arrived here in 327 BCE, they captured the famous fort called Sogdai Shila
 unhone bactria or sonda ko ek hi rajya main shaamil kar diya
 Soddai freedom from this died such that it could never come back again
 phir yahan ek unani raajaaon kaa silsilaa chalaa

 China invaded this area in 36 BC

 Sogda came on the silk route and the Sogdai people got into business with great vigor

 Near the Panjkant city of Tajikistan, these three have also got the pictures of the altar offered

 sunahale chaaval ko philipino, taiwan main tathaa american chaaval kaltivaar 'cocaodrai' ke saath or sthaneey chaaval kaltivars ke saath kiya utpaadit gaya he
 The first field trials of these golden rice cultivars were conducted in 2004 by the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center
 Field testing will allow more accurate measurement of the nutritional value of golden rice and pave the way for food testing
 Preliminary results of field trials revealed that farm-grown golden rice produced 4 to 5 times more son carotene than golden rice grown in greenhouse stage
 2005 main, jaev praudyogiki company, singenta main shodhakartaaon kii ek team ne "golden rice 2 naamak sunahare chaaval kii ek kism kaa utpaadan kiya
 They combined the original golden rice crt1 with the phytone synthase gene of myjay
 Golden rice 2 produces 23 times more carotenoids than golden rice, and accumulates beta-carotene prominently
 To achieve this, it is estimated that the highest yield is 144 g of pressure
 Will be eaten
 The bioavailability of carotene from any other species has not been tested in any model
 june 2005 main, anusandhankarta peter bear ne bill evam melinda gates foundation se sunahale chaaval main pro-vitamins e, vitamins-i, aayran evam zinc kii jaivaupalabdhta ke str ko badhaakar tathaa genetic badlaav ke dwaara protein gun main sudhaar kar usko or sudhaarney ke liye dhan praapt kiya
 This research, which paved the way for the creation of golden rice, was done to help children who are suffering from vitamin a deficiency
 21veen shatabdi kii shuruuaat main africa or dakshin purv asia ke 118 deshon ke 124 million logon ke viedi se peedit hone kaa anumaan tha
 VAD is responsible for 1-2 million deaths in a year, 500,000 cases of irreversible blindness and millions of cases of exacerbations
 bacchon or garbhvatee mahilaon par sabase adhik khatra hota he
 Vitamin a is fed as a fire suppressant and is injected in areas where there is a deficiency of vitamin a in food
 1999 tak 43 deshon main 5 varsh se kam umr ke bacchon ke liye vitamin e anupuran kaarykram the; inamen se 10 deshon main prati varsh poorak ke do hai dose uplabdh the, jo unisef ke anusaar viedi ko prabhaavapurn dhang se khatm kar sakate hai
 However, UNICEF and many ngos are engaged in supplementation keeping in mind that
 As low as possible, repeated low dose supplementation should be the goal
 kyonki kai deshon main jahaan ke khaanon main vitamins e kii kami hoti he, bachche chaaval ko ek purna ahaar kii tarah lete hai, isliye provitamin e utpaadit karne ke liye chaaval kaa genetic badlaav vitamin anupoorak kaa ek behatar or kam kharchila vikalp ho saktaa he, yaa hari subjiyon kii khapat yaa animal product kii khapat ko badhanaa bhi ek acha vikalp ho saktaa he
 This can be equated to genetically engineered iodized salt or fluoridated water

 tab se, samuchit provitamin e ke saath sunahale chaaval ke unnat prabhedon kaa vikaas iske poshak tatwon ke puure khaadya jaruraton ko un logon tak pahunchane ke liye kiya gaya jo roj lagbhag 75 gram chaaval khate hai
 In particular, since carotene is hydropholic, it is necessary to have sufficient fat present in golden rice food to be able to overcome vitamin a deficiency
 is sandarbh main yah mahatvapurn he ki vitamin e kii kami shaayad hi kabhi ek alag ghatana he, balki aamtaur par ek santulit aahaar kii ek saamaanya kami ke saath iskaa judaav he
 Therefore, about assuming the same bioavailability as other natural sources of vitamin A, Greenpeace estimates that adult humans need to eat about 9 kilograms of cooked golden rice of the first breed to obtain their son-carotene RDO
 However, while a lactating woman will require twice the amount, the effect of an unbalanced diet is not entirely responsible
 In other words, it is almost impossible to both produce and simultaneously eat enough original golden rice to reduce or reduce vitamin a deficiency
 yah daawa haalanki sunahale chaaval ke prototip kaltivaar se sambandhit he, adhik haal ke sanskarnon main vitamin e ke apekshaakrit adhik ucch gun hai
 Potricus played a leading role in the effort to distribute golden rice for free to farmers for subsistence
 iske liye kai companiyon kii jarurat thi jinke paas ise muft main license dene ke liye bear ke shodhon par bauddhik sampada adhikaar tha
 Bayer received funding from the European Commission 'carotin Plus' research program, to obtain the funds it was legally required to hand over the invention rights to the corporate sponsor of the program, Janeca
 Bayer and Potricus used 70 intellectual property rights from 32 different companies and universities to make golden rice
 unhen in sabhi ke liye muft license sthapit karne kii jarurat padi jisase ki singenta or pariyojna ke anya maanviya saajhedaar prajjan kaarykram main sunahale chaaval kaa upyog kar saken tathaa nai fasalein viksit kar saken
 The free license, the so-called human use license, was quickly approved due to a positive publicity, particularly in Time magazine in July 2000, that golden rice had been made
 sunahale chaaval ko anuvanshik rup se sanshodhit pehali fasal kaha jaataa he jo taarkik rup se phydemand tha or is prakaar ise vyapak sweekruti mili
 monsento pehali company thi jisane group free license kii manjuuri di
 The group also had to define the division between human and commercial use
 yah aankada $10 000 amareeki dollar main sthapit kiya gaya tha
 Therefore, Syngenta did not have to pay any royalties for commercial use until a farmer or a follower of golden rice genetics earned more than $ 10 000 per year
 sunahare chaaval ke maanviya upyog ke liye koi shulk nahin he or kisaanon ko beej rakhane or dubaara ropane kii anumati he
 Critics of genetically engineered crops have expressed various concerns
 inamen se ek yah he ki multah sunahale chaaval main paryaapt vitamin e nahin he
 a new variety of rice has been developed to solve this problem
 halanki, paudhe kii kataai ke samay vitamin e ke ksharan kii gati or pakane ke baad kitna batch jaataa he, is par abhi bhi andeh he
 Greenpeace opposed all genetically modified organisms and opined that golden rice is the Trojan horse that would open the door to more widespread use of gmos
 ek bhartiya GMO virdohi kaaryakarta vandana shiva kaa tark he ki samasya yah nahin he ki us vishesh fasal main koi kami he, balki yah ki garibon main aakshamata kii samasya he or khaadya fasalon main jaivvibhinnata kii kami hoti he
 These problems are exacerbated by corporate control of agriculture based on genetically modified foods

 Other groups say that various foods rich in vitamin a such as tubers, leafy green vegetables, and fruits can provide enough vitamin a to children
 vaastavik tathyon ke adhyayan kii kami or is anischitata ke kaaran ki kitne log sunahale chaaval kaa upyog karenge, dablyuechao ke kuposhan visheshgy francisco branka yah nishkarsh nikaalte hai ki "anupoorak pradaan karnaa, vitamin e yukt maujuud khadyon ko sudrudh karnaa or logon ko gaajar yaa kuch nishchit patteydaar subjiyan ugane kii shiksha dena, samasya se ladane kaa sabase sahi rasta he"

 Acid is a chemical compound which dissolves in water to give hydrogen ions
 iskaa ph maan 7
0 se kam hota he
 According to the modern definition given by Johannes Nicholas Bronstedt and Martin Laurie, acid is the chemical compound that provides hydrogen ions to the repulsive compound
 jaise- asitic amla or salphurik amla 
 amla, thos, drav yaa gas, kisi bhi bhautik avasthaa main paae ja sakate hai
 They can live in pure form or in slurry form
 jis padaarth yaa yogic main amla ke gun paae jate hai ve kehalaate hai
 Acidity or acidity is a disease caused by excess of hydrochloric acid in the human bowel
 amla un padaarthon ko kehete hai jo pani main ghulne par khattey swaad ke hote hai, haldi se bani roli ko pilaa kar dete hai,tathaa inkaa jaleey vilyan nile litmus paper ko laal karata he
 Most metals react with hydrogen to produce gas, and neutralize the base
 mote hisaab se ksharak un padaarthon ko kehete hai jinka vilyan chikna-chikna sa lagata he, swaad kadva hota he, haldi ko laal kar dete hai or amlon ko udasin karte hai
 To neutralize means to make a substance which has neither the properties of acid nor of base
 lavaazie ne oxygen ke gunon kaa adhyayan karte samay dekha ki carbon, gandhak or phosphorus sadrush tatv jab oxygen main jalte hai tab unase bane oxide jal ke saath milakar amla banaate hai
 They reached the result that there is oxygen in acids and oxygen is the cause of acidic acid
 isi kaaran is gas kaa naam "oxygen" padaa, jiskaa arth hota he "amla banaanevaala padaarth" tathaa isi kaaran german bhashaa main oxygen ko "sir staf" arthath amla padaarth kehete hai
 Lavaziye divided acids into two classes, inorganic acids and organic acids
 peeche dekha gaya ki kuch tatwon ke oxide pani main ghulkar amla nahin balki kshar banaate hai or kuch amlon main oxygen bilkul nahin hota
 Bertile invented hydrocyanic acid in 1787, Davy invented hydrochloric acid in 1810–11 and hydriodic acid in 1813
 inamen se kisi main oxygen nahin he
 It has been observed later that the substances which are completely dry do not have any acidic reaction
 tab logon ne amlon ko do virgon main vibhakt kiya, ek hydro-amla or doosraa oxy-amla
 Back in 1815, Dewey suggested that the acidicity of acids is not due to oxygen, but due to hydrogen
 duulang ne san 1815 main oxylik amla kaa adhyayan kiya or is parinaam par pahunche ki oxynwaale or bina oxynwaale amlon main koi bhed nahin he
 Acids do not have any properties that we can call specific characteristics of acids
 saadhaaran gun upar bataae ja chuke hai
 In acid and metal reactions, one, or more, hydrogen atoms of an acid molecule are displaced by metals, metal oxides, hydroxides or carbonates
 aise bhi kuch amla hai jo khattey hone ke badale mithe hote hai
 One such acid is amido-phosphoric acid
 kuch aise bhi amla hai jo ksharhar nahin hote
 There are also some alkalis whose hydrogen is displaced by metals
 fitkaree amla nahin he
 There is also no hydrogen to be displaced
 par yah swaad main khatta or kriya main ksharhar hota he
 It also turns blue litmus to red
 isi prakaar sodium baislphide khatta or ksharhar hota he
 It turns blue litmus red
 isamen visthapit honevaala hydrogen bhi he, par yah amla nahin he
 Methane is not an acid, but its hydrogen is displaced by zinc and thus zinc is dimethyl which is not a salt
 at: amla kii koi santoshprad paribhaasha ab tak nahin di ja saki he
 If we want to define acids on the basis of ion theory, then we can say that hydrogen ions are essential in acids
 silavian ne san 1659 main pehle pahal amlon or ksharakon main vibhed kiya tha
 In 1774, Rul gave the name base, which combines with acids to form salts
 aajkal ksharak un oxygen vaale padaarthon ko kehete hai jo amlon ke poorak hote hai
 Alkali metals, alkali metals and other metal oxides and all those things are alkalis which combine with acids to form salts
 aarambh main ksharak keval un dhaatuon athwa dhaatuon ke oxidon ke liye vyavahrat hota tha jo lavenon ke "base" yaa aadhaar the
 The bases of salts are essential components
 ksharak vastav main ve padaarth hai jo amla ke saath milakar lavan or jal banaate hai
 For example, zinc oxide combines with sulfuric acid to form zinc sulfate and water
 daahak soda salfurik amla ke saath milakar sodium sulphate or jal banaata he
 Oxides of metals are generally base
 par iske apwaad bhi hai
 The bases contain metal oxides and hydroxides, but for convenience some groups of elements are also formed which combine with acids to form salts without water
 aise ksharakon main ammonia, hydraxylemin or phosphin hai
 Fluid dissolves ammonia but gives no color with phenolphthalein
 at: kahan tak yah ksharak kaha ja saktaa he, yah baat sandigdh he
 Although the definition of the base above is very unsatisfactory, it has not given a good definition
 ksharak or kshar paryaayavachi jaabd nahin hai
 All bases are bases but not all bases are bases
 kshar-dhaatuon ke oxide, jaise sodium oxide, jal main ghulkar hydraksaide banaate hai
 They are strongly basic
 kshareey mrudadhatuon ke oxide, jaise kellisyam oxide, jal main alp viley or alp kshareey hote hai
 Oxides of other metals do not dissolve in water and their hydroxides are made indirectly
 dhaatuon ke oxide or hydraksaide ksharak hote hai
 Alkali metal oxides dissolve quickly in water
 kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main kam viley hote hai or kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main tanik bhi viley nahin hai
 Some nonmetal hydrides, such as hydrides of nitrogen and phosphorus are also consumed
