 Cells derived from each embryo can vary from one part of the body to another, and this often results in an increase in the characteristics of the skin color of the mosaicism in the human chimera
 chimera intersex arthath purush judawaan or mahila judawaan kii koshikaon se nirmit ho saktaa he
 In addition, in some cases the individual or chimera may have two sets of DNA
 kabhi kabhi ek judawaan bhrun puri tarah se viksit hone main vifal hota he or apane jivit judawaan ke liye samasyaayein paidaa karnaa jari rakhata he
 One fetus behaves like a parasite to another
 kabhi kabhi paraseete judawaan duusare kaa lagbhag aprabhedya hissaa ban jaataa he or kabhi kabhi iske saath chikitsa dwaara nipta jaataa he
 Parasites are a very rare type of twins in which only one viable twin is endangered when another zygote becomes a cancer factor or molar
 iskaa matlab yah he ki ekayugmanaj kaa koshika vibhaajan aniyantrit rup se jari rahata he, jo ek vyavhaarya bhrun se bad kar ek cancer vruddhi kaa rup le letaa he
 Typically, this occurs when a twin has triploidy or has a full parenchymal umbilical cord elevated, resulting in a small embryo or no fetus and a carcinogenic, much larger fetal-like structure that resembles grape bunches
 
 kabhi kabhi, ek aurat ko garbhavastha ke dauraan garbhpaat hojaataa he, phir bhi garbhavastha jari rahati he; ek judawaan kaa garbhpaat ho gaya tha, lekin doosraa apni avadhi puri karne main sakasham rata he
 This phenomenon is similar to Vanishing twin syndrome, but usually occurs after Vanishing twin syndrome
 aamtaur par judawaan bacchon kaa janm ke samay vazan kam hota he or samay se purv prasav kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he jaisaa ki aam taur par adhiktar ekaadhik prasavon main hota he
 Twins on average are relatively small in singleton throughout their lifetime
 ekayugmanaj judawaan bacchon main, jo ek naal se jude hote hai, twin-tu-tvi
 is avasthaa kaa arth he ki ek judawaan se khun duusare judawaan ko bant jaataa he
 One twin, the 'donor' twin, is small and anemic and the other recipient twin is large and polycythemic
 is haalat se donon judwa bacchon kaa jivan khatre main pad jaataa hai
 The study of twins is used to determine how much genetics or environmental influences are attributable to a particular trait
 ye adhyayan ekayugmanaj or dviyugmanaj judawaan bacchon kii chikitsiya, anuvaanshik yaa manovaigyanik visheshtaon kii tulana karke yah prayaas karte hai ki jin abhivyaktiyon yaa paryaavarniya prabhaav se anuvanshiki prabhaav ko alag kar saken
 ve judawaan jo jivan kii shuruyaat main alag kar die gaye hai or alag gharon main paley hai, ko visheshkar is prakaar ke adhyayanon ke liye chunaa jaataa he, jinhen maanav swabhaav ke anveshan main vyapak rup se prayog kiya jaataa he
 However, the usefulness and accuracy of the study of these twins has been questioned and remains controversial
 judwaaon se sambandhit shreshth adhyayan ab aanvik anuvanshik adhyayan ke saath padhe jate hai jo vyaktigat jeenon kii pahchaan karte hai
 In rare cases, eggs are fertilized at different times due to sex between two or more times, between twins, twins either in the same menstrual cycle or, more rarely, after pregnancy
 Occurs in phase
 As a result, a woman becomes more likely to have fraternal twins from different fathers
 This phenomenon is known as hetropaiternal superfiction
 1992 ke ek adhyayan kaa anumaan he ki dviyugmanaj judawaan bacchon main hetropaternal superficndation kii aavruti, jinke abhibhavak pitrutv mukaddamon main shaamil the, lagbhag 2
4% thi, adhik jaankaree ke liye, neeche sandarbh anubhag dekhen
 Dizygotic twins arising from pairs of different races may sometimes be mixed twins, which exhibit different ethnic and racial characteristics
 2008 main germany se ek shwet pita or ghana se ek ashwet maa se aise hi ek jode kaa janm hua tha
 Heterotopic pregnancy is a very rare type of diploid twin in which one twin is normally implanted in the uterus and the other remains in the fallopian tube as an ectopic pregnancy
 asthanik garbhadhaaran kaa avashya hi nidaan kiya janaa chahie kyonki ve maa ke liye jaanaleva ho sakate hai
 However, in most cases, intrauterine pregnancy can be avoided
 atyant durlabh maamalon main, ekayugmanaj judawaan bacchon main, judwa bachche vipareet lingon ke saath paidaa hote hai
 The likelihood of this is so low that multiple babies born with different sexes have been accepted worldwide for medical research on the solid basis that multiple children in the uterus are not monozygous
 jab ekayugmanaj judawaan alag lingon ke saath paidaa hote hai to aisa gunasutra janm dosha ke kaaran hota he
 In this case, although the twins come from the same egg, it is incorrect to call them genetically identical, since they have different karyotypes
 ekayugmanaj alag alag jeenon ke sakriy hone ke kaaran alag alag tareekon se viksit ho sakate hai
 "semi-identical twins" are more unusual
 ye "aadhe-samaan judawaan" bacchon kii pariklpana tab hoti he jab ek anishechit anda do samaan ova main vibhakt ho jaataa he tathaa ye ova nishechan ke anukool hote hai
 Both cloned ova are fertilized by different spermatozoa and these eggs organize into chimeric blastomers and undergo another cell duplication
 yadi yah blostomer ek judawaan ghatana ke rup main badal jaae, to do bhrun banenge, jinamein se prayek kaa alag paitruk jin or samaan matra jin hoga
 As a result, twins will be born with identical genes from the mother's side but with different genes from the father's side
 prayek bhrun kii koshikaayen kisi bhi shukranu se jin grahan karengi, jiske parinamswaroop chimera bachche honge
 Until recently it was recorded in Western medicine, there was speculation about this variety
 jaanwaron kii kai prajatiyon main judawaan bachche aam hai jaise billi, bhed, nevale tathaa hiran
 maweshiyon main judawaan bachche hone kii sambhaavna 1-4% he or judwaaon kii vishmataaon main sudhaar ke liye shodh jari hai, jo breader ke liye adhik laabhadaayak ho sakate hai yadi jatiltaaon se bachaa ja sake yaa unka sahi dhang se prabandhan kiya ja sake
 The nine-striped armadillo has identical twins in the form of regular reproduction rather than the usual cases
 bhura ek rang he
 It occurs in deep shades of red, orange and yellow

 According to Ramacharitra Manas, when Ram came to Valmiki ashram, he lay down like a stick on the ground to offer obeisance at the feet of Adikavi Valmiki and came out of his mouth

 In 1922 Howard Roark is a student of architecture at a prestigious college
 use college se nikaal diya jaataa he kyonki yah chetavanee baar-baar milane ke baavjood ki uske banaae imaaraton ke nakshe or dizine pratha se hat rahen hai or use waapas sahi maarg par aana chahie, vah is vishvas par atal rahata he ki imaaraton ko apane sthaan, saamagree or prayog ke hisaab se saralata or sundarata se bananaa chahie
 Classical methods were valued in college and in the architecture world at the time, while Roark thought that if a construction did not require a pillar, arch or other element, it should not be put there
 college kaa adhyaksh use ek antim mauqaa detaa he or kahata he ki vah apni galati maanakar saamaajik-str par pasand kii jane vaali shastreey nirmaan-pratha apana le kyonki rork main bahut kshamta or gun hai or vah aage chalakar ek prasidd, samrudh or safal architect ban saktaa he
 Roark refuses and is shown the college door
 rork new york jaakar henry camran naamak ek architect ke saath kaam karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 Cameron was once considered to be a rising star of the modernism wave of manufacturing but has been maligned because of its rude nature and social practice
 rork phir bhi us se prerit he or jaanboojh kar uske saath kaam karata he or us se bahut sikhta he
 At the same time a fellow student of Roark, Peter Keating, who is unpolitical but popular, passes from college with multiple honors
 college main vah aksar rork ke paas madad lene jaataa tha kyonki rork ke dizine sabase saafe or nipun hua karte the
 Keating joins New York's famous production company, Franken & Heyer
 vahaan keating jald hi apni saamaajik kushaltaaon or khushamadi se us company ke ek maalik, gaye francan, kaa priy ho jaataa he
 He goes in secret to help Roark to design his first building and draws a map based on his ideas, which is successful
 ek taraf camran or rork gazab ke adwitiya nirmaan banaate hai jinhen samaaj main adhik manyata nahin milti or duusari taraf keating kii chapalusee use tezi se kamyaabi detii he or use apni company main saathi bana diya jaataa he
 Cameron is growing old and closes his company
 isapar keating rork ko naukari detaa he, lekin jald hi aadesh na maanane ke liye ucch maalik rork ko nikaal detaa he
 Roark finds a job and hires a company that allows him to create the designs he wants, but on the condition that his designs are then given to other architects of the same company who then tweak them as per their custom
 
 vahaan ek graahak ko rork ke mul naqshe itane pasand aate hai ki rork company chhodkar apni nijee company khol letaa he, lekin usko bahut kam graahak milte hai
 Instead of changing his ideals, he closes his company
 phir vah francan kii hi ek pathar kii khan main mazaduri kaa kaam kar letaa he jahaan chattaane todna hi uskaa kaam hota he
 At the same time Keating's star is shining and at a gathering he meets and is attracted to the handsome and intelligent, but temperamental, daughter Dominique Franken of Franken, the company's high boss
 dominik new york main hi ek "new york binar" naam ke akhbaar ke liye sameekshak-lekhak he
 One day Roark is working in a stone mine when Dominić passes by, as she is on a vacation for a few days at a family home in the same city
 vahaan dominik or rork ek duusare ko dekh lete hai or unamem foran aapasi aakarshan ho jaataa he
 But both are stiff with each other
 kuch dinon baad rork dominik ke ghar aata he or, ek-duusare se bina koi shabd bhi kahe, unamem shaareerik sambandh sthapit ho jate hai
 Soon after this, Roark gets the news that a customer is trying to get him to build a building and, before Dominic even knows his name, he returns to New York
 calzaworth tuhi dominik vaale akhbaar main hi architekchar par ek lokapriya lekhak he jo is vishay par bahut padhi jane vaali kitaaben bhi chhap chukaa he
 People are greatly influenced by his writings and dislike his stated buildings and constructions
 yah uske liye shahar ke prabhaavshaalee virgon main pravesh karne or shaktishaalee banane kaa ek zariyaa ban gaya he
 There is always the message of Tohi that art is a social subject and work should be for the public interest and public upliftment
 jab ek amir aadmi apane maranoparant use ek lakh dollar chhod gaya to tuhi ne yah raashi 'saamaajik adhyayan centre' naamak sanstha ko de di jahaan vah 'kala, ek saamaajik lakshan' ke vishay par leccherar tha
 Keating also wants to connect with Toohi's popularity and wants Toohi to show compassion to him in his writings as well
 or yahi hota bhi he
 Tohi Roark's liberty gets irritated by thought and style
 vah keating se rork ke bare main kai sawaal poochta he
 Does Roark laugh, does he seem unhappy, does he like money, does he want people's appreciation and has he always wanted to be an architect
 tuhi ab rork ko nasht karnaa chahta he
 Dominiak and Tohi both see Roark in a gathering and Dominiuk now knows his identity
 vah yah bhi bhaanp leti he ki tuhi uske viruddh abhiyaan chalaaegaa
 In her next article in the newspaper, she writes a tricky article about Roark's amazing building that calls him a ray of light but also seems to condemn him: tuhi ek kamazor-vyaktitv vaale amir seth ko rork dwaara 'maanav aatma kaa mandir' naam kaa ek smarak banavaane ke liye protsaahit karata he, jisamen rork ko apni manmarzi kaa nirmaan karne kii chhot milti he
 He includes in it a naked idol of Dominić, causing a cry against him
 tuhi ab usee seth se rork par dhokhaa or ayogyata kaa muqaddama chalavaataa he
 In this, many well-known architects come and give statements that Roark's methods break the practice and are wrong
 dominik muqaddame main rork ke samarthan main bayaan detii he lekin rork haar jaataa he
 His company then closes
 rork ke haarane ke baad dominik faisalaa karti he ki, kyonki is duniya main kabhi bhi rork jaise logon kii mahanata nahin sweekaari jaaegi, vah puri tarah vaastavik duniya main hi apana jivan guzaaregi jisamen keating jaise log hi safal hai
 She proposes marriage to Keating and Keating accepts
 iske liye keating ko tuhi kii bhanji ke saath apni sagaai todani hoti he, jo keating se behad pyaar karti he
 Dominić becomes a complete Keating - she invites influential people to her house to feast on Keating's business promotion, mixes everything with her and says exactly what she wants
 akhbaar main bhi vah keating kii prashansa main likhti he or rork kii ninda karti he
 Despite this, Roark continues to receive small amounts of customers who like his work
 dominik or tuhi jis akhbaar ke liye likhte hai uskaa maalik gail vynand naam kaa ek behad amir aadmi he
 He is a great builder and his work persuades Keating to sleep with Dominic Waynand
 vynand phir keating ko uski khamoshi kii keemat dekar dominik or keating kaa talaak karwaata he or phir swayan dominik se shaadi kar letaa he
 It is now known to him that the original architect of all the constructions he liked was actually Roark and he gives Roark the job of making himself and Dominiak's house
 vynand or rork main gahari dosti ho jaati he, haalanki vynand ko rork or dominik ke pichley rishte ke bare main kuch nahin pataa hota
 Dominić and Keating, who have lost their fame, realize that their lives have failed
 lekin vah tuhi se jaakar gidgidaata he ki vah use kisi tarah 'cortland nivas pariyojna' ke nirmaan kaa kaary dilava de, jiske liye sabhi architect utsuk hai or jise karne se use phir se khyaati mil sakati he
 Tohi gets him this job
 keating jaanata he ki uske sabhi safal nirmaanon ke peeche rork kaa dimaag rahaa he isliye vah sidhaa rork ke paas jaakar us se dizine main madad maangata he
 Roark agrees on one condition - he will secretly design Cortland but the construction must be exactly as he would have it been made
 dizine puraa kar ke rork vynand ke saath ek nauka yatra par nikal jaataa he
 When Roark returns, he learns that, despite Keating's promise, his design changes have been made
 vah jaakar cortland ko barood se uda daalata he
 The whole country considers Roark a criminal, but now Wayanand decides that he will support Roark
 vah apane akhbaaron ko rork kii himaayat karne ko kahata he
 There is anger in the public, so the sales of his newspapers start falling but with the help of the Dominic, he keeps on standing
 akhirkaar akhbaar kaa karmchaaree sangh aakar use chetavanee detaa he - yaa to vah rork kaa virodh kare varanaa uskaa akhbaar chhapana band ho jayega
 Wayanand concedes defeat and a strong condemnation of Roark is published in the newspaper
 adaalat main jab kaarywai shuru hoti he to lagata he ki rork ke bachane kii koi aashaa nahin he
 But there, Roark gives a rousing speech to the court attendees on personal freedom, original inventions and the value of staying true to their souls
 manushyon ko do virgon main vibhajit karte hue vah kahata he ki: The court holds Roark innocent
 vynand samaj jaataa he ki uskaa akhbaar vyaktigat kshamta or swatantraaa kuchalane kaa kaam karata he or vah use band kar detaa he
 He assigns Roark the task of building the world's tallest skyscraper
 18 maheene baad vynand imaarat taiyaar hone vaali hoti he
 In the final pages of the novel Dominić goes to the construction site and a new sentry asks Dominiak his name there
 dominik jawaab detii he "shrimati rork", jis se pataa chalata he ki ant main vah rork kii patni ban gai he

the likelihood, magnitude, and timing is uncertain and controversial, but some possible examples of climate changes include significant slowing of the ocean circulation that transports warm water to the North Atlantic, large reductions in the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheet s, accelerated global warming due to carbon cycle feedbacks in the terrestrial biosphere, and releases of terrestrial carbon from permafrost regions and methane from hydrates in coastal sediments
 One or more of these changes is likely to increase the rate, with magnitude, and duration of climate change probability

 There is some evidence that global warming may cause carbon loss from terrestrial ecosystems, leading to increased predictions of atmospheric CO2 levels
 Many climate models have had such temperatures through the 21st century An indication of global warming can be accelerated by the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to an increase in all 11 models in this C4MIP
 The study found that a large fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will remain airborne if climate change is responsible
 From the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied from 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the model 50
 And the majority of ppm lying between 100
 High CO2 levels led to an additional climate temperature increase ranging between 0
