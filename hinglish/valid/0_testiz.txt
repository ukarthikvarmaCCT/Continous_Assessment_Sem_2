 Such separation does not fall under the category of legal separation or trial separation

 pracheen hindu sahitya main dev-shilpi vishwakarma dwaara banaaye gaye anek vimaanon kaa varnan miltaa he
 For example, according to Valmiki Ramayana, Pushpaka Vimana was constructed by Shilpacharya Vishwakarma for the use of Pitamaha Brahma
 vishwakarma, kii mata sati yogasiddha thim
 Along with the deities, eight vasu are also mentioned, in which the eighth vasu was Yogasiddha, the wife of Prabhas
 yahi prabhas the jinhen mahabharat ke anusaar vashishtha rishi ne shraap diya tha ki unhen mrityu lok main kaafii samay vyateet karnaa hoga

 This aircraft is described in detail in Valmiki: meghon ke samaan ucch, swarna samaan kantimay, puspak bhoomi par ekatrit swarna ke samaan prathit hota tha
 Adorned with many gems, covered with many types of flowers and filled with floral-pollen, it resembled a mountain peak

 While walking in the sky, it was seen being pulled by superior swans
 iskaa nirmaan ati sundar dhang se kiya gaya tha, evam adbhut shobhaa se sampann dikhataa tha
 Many metals were used in its construction in such a way that this mountain looked strange due to the planets and the moon, with a sky and many colors
 uskaa bhoomi kshetra swarna-mandit kritrim parvatamalaon se paripurna tha
 Many mountains were made green with elaborate rows of trees

 valmiki ramayana ke anusaar puspak vimaan kuch aisa hua karata tha: When Hanuman saw this amazing aircraft, he was also surprised

 This book is a part of his original major text yantra-sarveshvam

 The planes which were built and operated with this knowledge at that time used to travel in different planets of the universe
 is vaimaanik-shaastra main aath adhyay, ek sau adhikaran, paanch sau sutara or teen hajaar shloke hai
 This book is written in Vedic Sanskrit language
 is vimaan main jo takanic prayog hui he, uske peeche aadhyatmik vigyaan hi he
 According to the texts, today any substance is considered to be a root, but in ancient times, the proven people had the ability to generate consciousness in these substances, using which they could create a machine that would adapt to the conditions like an aircraft
 Used to find vartmaan kaal main vigyaan ke paas aise takneekee utkrisht samaadhaan uplabdh nahin he, tabhi ye baaten kaalpanik evam atishyokti lagati hai
 In that period science may have had the ability to awaken the consciousness of matter, due to which the plane was activated by self-sensing and changed shape according to the need
 padaarth kii chetana ko jaagrit karne jaisi vidyaon ke anya pramaan bhi ramayana evam vibhinn hindu dharm granthon main praapt hote hai
 Pushpak Vimana also had the specialty that it was operated by the same person who had proved the aircraft operating mantra
 kai adhyayan evam shodhakarttaaon ke anusaar, ravan kii lanka main is puspak vimaan ke alaava bhi kai prakaar ke vimaan the, jinka prayog vah apane rajya ke alag-alag bhaagon main tathaa rajya ke baahar avaagaman hetu kiya karata tha
 This fact is also confirmed by the verses of Valmiki Ramayana, in which Rama, after the Lanka victory, told Laxman while flying in the Pushpak plane that with many planes, Lanka is shining on the earth
 yadi yah vishnu ji kaa vaikunthdham hota to yah puri tarah se safed badalon se ghira hota
 There were six aircrafts in Lanka for flying and landing of these aircraft

 yah yahan seemaa kaa kaam karata he or china-nepal seemaa par mukhya himalayan jalsambar vibhajit hokar dono taraf bahata he
 In 1808, the British started the Great Trigonometric Survey of India to determine the highest mountains of the world
 dakshini bharat se shuru kar, survey team uttar kii ore badi, jo vishaal 500 kigra kaa vikonman kaa istemaal karte the jisase sambhavat: sahi maap liya ja sake
 They reached the mountains near the Himalayas in 1830, but Nepal was reluctant to let the British enter the country because Nepal feared political and possible invasion
 sarweyre dwaara kai anurodh kiye gayi par nepal ne saare anurodh thukraa diye
 The British were forced to continue observation from the Terai, an area south of Nepal that is parallel to the Himalayas
 tej barsha or malaria ke kaaran tarai main sthiti bahut kathin thi: teen survey adhikari malaria ke kaaran maare gayi jabaki kharaab swasthya ke kaaran do ko avkaash mil gaya
 Nevertheless, in 1847, the British were compelled and began to observe in detail the Himalayan peaks from the observation station to 240 km
 mausam ne saal ke ant main kaam ko teen mahine tak roke rakhaa
 In November 1847, the British Surveyor General Andrew Waugh of India made a number of observations from the Sawaipur station which is situated at the eastern end of the Himalayas
 us samay kanchanajangha ko vishwa ki sabase unchi chotii maani gai or usne ruchipurvak note kiya ki, is ke peeche bhi lagbhag 230 kimi dur ek chotii he
 Jaune Armstrong, who was a co-officer of Vogue, also saw this peak in the far west from a place he called the peak 'B'
 vaug ne baad main likhaa ki avlokan darshata he ki chotii ‘bi’ kanchanajangha se unchaa tha, lekin avlokan bahut dur se hua tha, satyaapan ke liye najadik se avlokan karnaa jaruri he
 In the coming year, Vogue sent a survey officer to observe peak 'B' in the Terai from the viewpoint, but the clouds stopped all efforts
 san 1849 main vaug ne vah kshetra james nicholson ko saunp diya
 Nicholson produced two observations from Girol 190 km away
 nicholson tab apane saath bada vikonman laayaa or purab kii ore ghuma diya, paanch alag sthanon se nicholson ne chotii ke sabase najadik 174 kimi dur se 30 se bhi adhik avlokan praapt kiye
 Nicholson went back to Patna, the Ganges River, to do some calculations based on his observations
 patna main uske kachche hisaab ne chotii ‘bi’ ki ausat oonchaai 9,200 me diya, lekin yah prakaash apvartan nahin samajha jaataa he, jo oonchaai ko galat bayaan karata he
 The number was clearly shown, although that peak was higher than 'B' Kanchenjunga
 yadhyapi, nicholson ko malaria ho gaya or use ghar laut jane ke liye vivash kiya gaya, hisaab-kitaab khatm nahin ho paaya
 Michael Hennessy, a subsidiary of Vogue, began assigning peaks based on Roman numbers, gave Kanchenjunga the IX name, and Choti 'B' the name XV
 san 1852 may survey kaa kendra dehradun main laayaa gaya, ek bhartiya ganitagya radhanath sikadar or bengal ke surveykshak ne nicholson ke naap par aadhaarit trikoshmetiya hisaab-kitaab kaa prayog kar pehali baar vishwa ke sabase unchi chotii kaa naam ek purv pramukh ke naam par everest diya, satyaapan karne ke liye baar-baar hisaab-kitaab hota rahaa or iskaa karyalayi udghosh, ki XV sabase unchaa he, kai saalon tak let ho gaya
 Vogue started work on Nicholas' data in 1854 and worked with his staff for nearly two years at vast distances over the years of calculations, transactions of light refraction, air pressure, observation
 san 1856 ke march main usne patr ke madhyam se kalakatta main apane pratinidhi ko apni khoj kaa puri tarah se udghosh kar diya
 The height of Kanchenjunga was clearly stated to be 28,156 feet, while the height of XV was stated
 vaug ne XV ke bare main nishkarsh nikaala ki “adhik sambhav he ki yah vishwa main sabase unchaa he”
 The peak XV was calculated to be 29,000 feet high, but it was publicly reported as 29,002 feet
 29,000 ko anumaan lagaakar 'round' kiya gaya he is avadharana se bachane ke liye 2 feet adhik joda diya gaya tha
 Pendalvad is a village in Adilabadu district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India, in the Jainath Mandal
 chumbak chikitsa ek chikitsa paddati he
 Its two methods are prevalent - universal, that is, by applying it to the palms and soles, and by applying it to the localized, diseased part
 is ke anusaar uttari dhruv tathaa dakshini dhrav vaale chumbakon kaa ek joda lekar sharir ke vidyutiya sahasambandh ke aadhaar par saamanyatya uttari dhruv vaale chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke daayen bhaagon par, aage kii ore va uttari bhaagon par kiya jaataa he, jabaki dakshini dhruv vaale chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke baayein bhaagon par, peeth par tathaa nichle bhaagon par kiya jaataa he
 This firm rule applies only to the universal use of magnets, while in the case of endemic use, more attention is given to disease infection, pain, swelling etc
 uttam parinaam hasil karne ke liye jab rog athwa uskaa prasar sharir ke upree bhaag arthath naabhi se upar ho to chumbakon ko hatheliyon par lagaaya jaataa he, jabaki sharir ke nichle bhaagon arthath naabhi se neeche vidyaman rogon main chumbakon ko talvon main lagaaya jaataa he
 In this, magnets are placed in places that are diseased, such as the knees and feet, painful vertebrae, eyes, nose, etc
 inamen rog kii tivrata tathaa rup ke anusaar ek, do or yahan tak ki teen chumbakon kaa prayog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, in severe pain of knee and neck, two magnets can be applied on different knees and third magnet can be applied on painful vertebrae of neck
 is prayog vidhi kii upyogita sthanik rog sankraman kii avasthaa main bhi hoti he
 In some situations like severe pain in the thumb, sometimes keeping the thumb between the poles of both magnets gives instant relief
 pramukhatya chumbak chikitsa kii do paddatiyaan prachlit hai- 1
 sarvadaihik arthath hatheliyon va talvon par lagane se tathaa 2
 sthanik arthath rogagrast bhaag par lagane se
 They are described here - is prayog vidhi ke anusaar uttari dhruv tathaa dakshini dhrav se sampann chumbakon kaa ek joda liya jaataa he
 Depending on the electrical correlation of the body, generally the north pole magnet is used on the right parts of the body, forward and north, while the south pole magnet is used on the left, back and lower parts of the body
 is done
 yah atal niyam chumbakon ke sarvadaihik prayog par hi lagu hota he, jabaki sthanik prayog kii avasthaa main rog sankraman, dard, sujan aadi par adhik dhyaan diya jaataa he
 To get the best results, when the disease or its spread is above the upper part of the body ie the navel, the magnets are applied to the palms, while in the diseases of lower parts of the body, ie below the navel, the magnets are applied to the soles
 is prayog vidhi main chumbakon ko un sthanon par lagaaya jaataa he, jo rogagrast hote hai, jaise- ghutana or pair, dardanaak kasheruka, aankh, naak aadi
 According to the intensity and form of the disease, one, two and even three magnets can be used
 udaahranarth- ghutane tathaa gardan ke tej dard main do chumbakon ko alag-alag ghutanon par tathaa tisare chumbak ko gardan kii dardanaak kasheruka par lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The method of this experiment is also useful in the case of endemic disease infection
 anguthe main tej dard hone jaisi kuch avasthaaon main kabhi-kabhi donon chumbakon ke dhruvon ke bich angutha rakhane se turant aaraam miltaa he
 It is beneficial for males and females of all ages
 chumbakon ke madhyam se ilaaj itnaa sidhaa-sada he ki yah kisi bhi samay, kisi bhi sthaan par or sharir ke kisi bhi ang par aajamaaya ja saktaa he
 Men or women, young or old, all can benefit from it
 chumbakatv se raktasanchaar sudharta he kuch samay tak chumbak lagaataar sharir ke sampark main rahe to sharir main garmi utpann hoti he, uski sari kriyaayein sudhar jaati hai or raktasanchaar bad jaataa he
 Due to this, the whole body gets strength, helps in curing disease, eliminates tiredness and weakness, due to which the patient gets quick health and the pain and swelling of every part of the body also goes away
 kuch maamalon main laabh badi teji se yah paddati itani shaktishaalee he or iskaa prabhaav itani teji se padataa he ki kai baar ek hi baar chumbak lagaana rog ko sadaa ke liye samaapt karne ke liye kaaphi hota he
 In many cases there is no need to install a magnet for the second time
 jaise ki daant kii pidaa or moch aadi main
 Preparation in advance is not necessary, many people can use the same magnet
 unhen saaf karne, dhone yaa janturahit banane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Although the magnet used in the treatment of infectious disease of the skin, it has to be cleaned
 yadi maheen kapade ke aavaran kaa upyog kiya ho to chumbak kii safai kaa koi prashn hi nahin rahata, keval kapade ko saaf karnaa paryaapt hota he
 It is not addictive, is not used to the treatment of magnets, and even if it is stopped suddenly, there is no problem
 chumbak sharir se pidaa ko khinch letaa he prayek rog main koi na koi pidaa avashya hoti he
 Whether the pain is due to any reason, the magnet has the virtue of reducing it, rather than ending it
 uski sahaayta se sharir kii sari kriyaayein saamaanya ho jaati hai
 For this reason, magnets have an effect on all diseases, pain goes away and disorders of body functions are cured
 chumbak kaa aakaar or dizin is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki use sharir ke kis bhaag par lagaana he
 There are some parts of the body, where large size magnets cannot be installed, small magnets will not work properly on some parts
 udhaaharan ke liye agar aankh par chumbak lagaana ho to chote aakaar kaa gol chumbak hona chahie, jo band aankh ke upar aa jaae
 On the other hand, if there is pain or swelling in most parts of the body, then a large size magnet will be applied
 isliye ek hi aakaar-prakaar ke chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke vibhinn bhaagon par nahin ho saktaa
 The same thing applies to the power of magnets
 sharir ke kuch komal ang jaise mastishk, aankh or hriday jahaan adhik shakti vaale chumbak nahin lagane chahie or na madhyam shakti ke chumbak adhik der tak lagane chahie
 Conversely, low-power magnets will not suffice for diseases of stiff and large muscles or bones, such as those of the hips, thighs, knees, or ankles
 na keval sthaneey rogon, balki saare sharir ke liye chumbakon ke chunaav main in baton kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie

 Windows Vista is the latest in a series of Microsoft operating systems and possibly the most revolutionary after Windows 95
 haalaanki vista oparating system ko adhik lokapriyata uske triayami graphics swaroop or vibhinn desktop onimeshan kii vajah se mili he lekin vastav main yah microsoft kii ore se jari kiya gaya ab tak kaa sabase surakshit oparating system bhi mana ja rahaa he
 It is also more efficient in terms of communication and networking than its previous operating system
 vista ke liye hindi samarthan bhi puri tarah uplabdh he or hindi language interphes pack ke madhyam se windos vista ko puri tarah hindi ke rang main ranga ja saktaa he
 Computer users have a curiosity about whether they really need to adopt Windows Vista, the new operating system released by Microsoft
 kya microsoft ke pichley oparating system windos ekspe windos 2003 or windos 2000 kii tulana main isamen aise fitures hai jinaki andekhi karnaa sambhav na ho
 Microsoft claims that Vista is more capable, simpler, faster, smooth and secure than previous Windows
 vista pichley oparating systams kii tulana main adhik teji se khulata or band hota he
 Start up and shutdown processes are completed in five to ten seconds
 haalaanki isamen vista ke apekshaakrit behatar hardware kaa bhi yogadan he lekin khud oparating system ke code main bhi iske liye vishesh prayaas kiya gaya he
 Vista's boom is also due to its new memory management technology that keeps the most used applications ready for loading in advance
 ise 'memri fech' kaha jaataa he
 The Ready Boost feature in Vista has also contributed to its speed
 ab tak windos main memri sambandhi atirikt aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye virtual memri ke rup main pejafilon kaa istemaal hota tha
 These were placed on the computer's hard disk
 lekin vista main iske liye yuasabi drive kaa istemaal karne kaa praavdhaan he jo hard discs kii tulana main bahut tej gati se kaary karti he

 There has been a general perception among Microsoft users about Microsoft's operating systems that they are less secure than their rival operating systems and are relatively more vulnerable to viruses, hacking, spa ware, etc
 microsoft ne vista main is baat par khaas dhyaan diya he
 Although Vista's original 'kernel' is not rewritten, its security has been strengthened this time
 pehali baat to yah ki ab is oparating system ke sabhi bhaag karnel mod main nahin chalate balki unamem se kuch chuninda hisse hi chalate hai
 Most drivers and software in Vista run in user mode and it is no longer easy to install anything in kernel mode
 iske liye sicurity certificate or administrator str ke adhikaron kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 And it would be very difficult to get administrator level privileges, especially in offices
 windos vista main saamaanya upyogkarta ke adhikaar simit hai
 It is also not that you as a normal user cannot install the software in your computer
 aisa karne ke liye unhen asthaayee taur par jaruri adhikaar praapt ho jate hai
 Microsoft has created two categories of computers for installing Vista operating system - Vista Capable PC and Vista Premium Ready
 aise sabhi computer windos vista sakasham hai jinamein kam se kam 800 megahatrj kaa procesar or 512 embi system memri uplabdh ho
 Such processors are rare now because hardly anyone is buying less than 2 ghz processor in the market
 yadi aapane pichley do ek saalon main apana computer kharida he to uskaa procesar kam se kam itani kshamta kaa avashya hoga
 It may be a matter of system memory that your traditional computer may have 128 MB or 256 MB memory
 aise main aapako saat-aath sau rupye kharch karke apni ram kaa apgredation karwaanaa pad saktaa he
 For Windows Vista capable computers there must be at least a graphics card supporting Direct X9 with WDDM driver support available
 computer ke graphics card main 32 embi kii graphics memri ho to paryaapt he
 Additionally, you will need a DVD ROM drive which may already be present in your computer
 hard discs main mahaj 20 jibi sthaan uplabdh ho, jisamen se 15 jibi khaali sthaan ho, to paryaapt he
 Simply, you don't need anything else to run Windows Vista Home Basic Edition

 hamaari aankh ke krishnapatal par kisi vastu kaa pratibimb vastu ko hataa lene ke lagbhag 1 / 16 second se lekar 1 / 10 second baad tak bana rahata he
 a simple frequency view consists of a circular letter or circle, in which holes are formed in one or two three circular rows at equal distances near the turn

 The object becomes visible only when the hole is exposed to the object

 The machine must remain in very bright light for clear inspection
 yadi ekasmaan teevr prakaash ke badale mashin ko prakaash main rahanaa chahie
 If the machine is illuminated by intense light instead of uniform fast light, and if the frequency of the fire is high enough that one of the sparks falls on exactly one of the revolutions on the machine, then the machine will look stable
 is aayojan se mashin ke kisi bhaag ke kisi bhaag ko photo liya ja saktaa he, uskaa nirikshan kiya ja saktaa he or mashin kaa koniya veg gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 The frequency number of a oscillating object, such as a staggered oscillator, can also be derived
 aavritidarshi aa ko vidyut motor mo dwaara ghumaya jaataa he
 The number of revolutions of the frequency can be corrected by increasing the speed of the motor at will and the value of the revolver can be determined from the counter mounted on the axis of the motor

 In this way the hole between the leaves opens and closes in a second as often as the vocal frequency
 iske baad aavritidarshi ko chalaakar swaritra ko vidyut dwaara dolit karte hai
 Due to the effect of electricity, oscillation of the oscillator remains permanent
 doordarshee main aavritidarshi ke chhidr pehle dhundhale, phir motor kii gati badhane ke saath falkar purna vrittakar ho jate hai
 As the speed increases, the holes are clearly visible
 yah tabhi sambhav hota he jab swaritra ke dolankaal main aavritidarshi kaa ek chhidr nikatavarti duusare chhidr ke sthaan par ghumkar aa jaataa he
 If the speed of the cycle is reduced a little, then the holes appear to be moving slowly backwards and if the speed is increased a little, then the holes seem to move slowly in the forward direction
 jab chhidr spasht sthir dikhaai padate hai to aavritidarshi kii bhramansankhya dekhakar swaritra kii aavritisankhya gyaat kii ja sakati he
 If there are a number of holes on the circle of the circle and the circle rotates in one second, then the frequency of the oscillator is less
 aavritidarshi kii gati isaki thik duni athwa tiguni, chauguni ityadi hone par bhi chhidr isi prakaar sthir dikhaai padate hai
 For this reason, the speed of the oscillator in the experiment is initially increased slowly by keeping it low

 In these, light is generated by alternating electronegregation of high frequency numbers

 That is, the blades appear to be moving upright and stopping in between

 If f make only one round in the same direction in one second and according to the picture, if the first glow is on circle 1, then the two points of this circle will appear just below each other
 duusari damak ke pahonchte hi vrutt 1 ke sthaan par vrutt 2 aa jayega or bindu dakshinavart disha main mude jaan padenge
 As soon as the third moment comes, circle 3 will come in place of circle 1 and the points will appear more bent
 vrutt sab ek samaan hai or sab baari se sthaan 1 par aate hai, jahaan prakaash kii damaken padati hai

 When Maharana Bhimsingh saw that Lord Shrinathji had happily visited Nathdwara and resided in the same temple again, his heart jumped with joy

 So Maharana Bhimsingh came by Nathdwara after seeing the auspicious day and was overwhelmed after seeing Lord Shrinathji

 Polarization is the property of transverse waves that is related to the direction of their oscillations
 dhruv kaa arth he 'nishchit'
 The polarized wave has oscillations in a finite form whereas the polarized wave has equal oscillations in all directions
 kisi gas yaa drav main gatiman dhwani tarangen dhruvan kaa gun pradarshit nahin karatin kyonki unki gati kii disha or dolan kii disha ek hi hoti he
 The beam of ordinary light is symmetric relative to the transmission direction, but in special cases it is characterized by asymmetry or unilaterality
 yah baat tourmaileen naamak hare rang ke prakritik crystal kii pattica ke dwaara aasaani se pramanit ho sakati he
 When ordinary light passes through this plate, the intensity of the beam does not change when the fillet rotates on the axis of the beam, but when this beam coming out of the terramine, rotating the second plate of the tourmaline, the intensity of the beam There is a lot of change in
 jab donon tourmailinon ke aksh samaantar hote hai tab to tivrata adhiktam hoti he
 As the angle between these axes increases, the intensity decreases and when it becomes equal to the right angle, the intensity value becomes zero
 spasht he ki pratham tourmaileen main se nikalne par prakaash main asamamiti kaa aisa gun utpann ho gaya he jo saadhaaran prakaash main nahin tha
 The name of this property is "dhruvana" and this quality of light is called "dhruvit"
 is drushti se saadhaaran prakaash "adhruvit" kehalaata he
 Through the phenomena of interference and diffraction, it becomes clear that just like sound, the transmission of light is in the form of waves and a material called ether has been conceived as the medium for this transmission
 dhruvan kii uparyukt ghatana yah pramanit karti he ki prakashtarangen dhwanitarangon ke samaan anudairdhya nahin hoti, kyonki anudairthay tarangon main kampan sancharan kii disha main hone ke kaaran uparyukt prakaar kii asamamiti sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, light waves are transverse, ie their vibrations are in the right-angled direction from waves like vibrations of the star's wire
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki anuprastha tarang main madhyam ke kan kaa kampanpath saral rekhaatmak hi ho
 It is necessary that the vibrational path is located in a plane on which the direction of wave propagation is normal
 at: is kampanpath kii akruti dirghavrittakar tathaa vishesh avasthaaon main vrittakar bhi ho sakati he
 The wave in which the shape of the vibration and if the vibration is simple linear, its direction is unchanged, it is called polar wave and in which this shape or direction keeps changing, it is called inverted
 is drushti se dhruvit prakaash nimnlikhit teen prakaar kaa ho saktaa he : 1
 level polarized 2
 dirghavritt dhruvit 3
 Circle Polarized
 ganitiya adhyayan se vidit he ki companon kii ye vibhinn akritiyaan, do samakonik saral aavart companon ke sangyojan se praapt hoti hai
 Conversely, whatever the shape of the vibration is, the decomposition of it can yield two right-angled simple periodic vibrations
 jab prakashtarang kisi paardarshee crystal main pravesh karti he, tab uske companon kaa aisa vighatan pratyaksht: ho jaataa he or do samtal dhruvit kirane crystal main prakat ho jaati hai
 Their vibrations are right-angled
 saamanyat: ye bhinn dishaao main gaman karti hai or unke veg baraabar nahin hote
 This phenomenon is called bivariation and by this, Heisenz invented polarization in 1960
 tourmaileen ke crystal main in do kirnon main se ek kaa avasorana ho jaataa he
 This is the reason for the origin of light polarized by Tourmaline
 is prakaash ke companon kii disha tourmaileen pattica ke crystalia aksh kii disha par nirbhar karti he or us pattica ko ghumaane se companon kii disha bhi badal jaati hai
 But the shape or direction of vibrations in ordinary superfluous light varies continuously from moment to moment, so when it comes out of the tourmaline, the intensity of the polar light also changes, but its average value is equal in each position of the tourmaline
 And this is what we see
 kintu jab samtal dhruvit prakaash, jiskaa aayam he, tourmaileen main se hokar nikalataa he tab vah dhruvit to rahata he, parantu uskaa aayam ghatakar ho jaataa he, jahaan tourmaileen kii sthiti kaa suchak kone he
 q = 0 is considered when the amplitude is greatest
 ko q = 90 degree hone par aayam a = 0 ho jaataa he or pargamit prakaash kaa lop ho jaataa he, chaahe aaptit prakaash ke aayam kaa maan kitna hi bada kyon na ho
