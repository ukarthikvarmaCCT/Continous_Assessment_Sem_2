 The Soviet Union's first satellite-based radio navigation system was the Tsiklone aimed at providing accurate positioning to ballistic missile submarines
 1967 or 1978 ke bich 31 tcyclone upgrahon kaa prakshepan kiya gaya
 The main problem of this system was that despite the stationary or slow moving vessels being highly accurate, determining the position required several hours of observation by the receiving station, which led to many navigational purposes and ballistic Proved to be unusable for guiding the new generation of missiles

 Most of the manufactured parts had a low level of quality due to which the engineers at NPO PM had to redesign them to a great extent which resulted in delayed performance
 12 oktober 1982 main cosmos-1413, cosmos-1414 or cosmos-1415 naamak teen upgrahon ko ek protone rocket ke madhyam se prakshepit kiya gaya
 It was decided to launch it with two simulated satellites, with only one GLONASS satellite being produced instead of the three satellites expected at launch
 america media ne apni khabar main is ghatana ko ek upgrah or "do gupt vastuon" kaa prakshepan bataaya
 For a long time Americans could not know the nature of those "objects"

 However, at the time of the financial crisis of 1989–1999, the funding of the space program was cut by 80 percent, and after that Russia found itself unable to afford this launch rate
 disambar 1995 main puraa samarthan milane ke baad disambar 1999 tak koi atirikt prakshepan nahin kiya gaya
 As a result, in 2001, the number of working satellites in the satellite group decreased to 6

 The GLONASS-K2 satellite launched in 2013–2015 will use three additional CDMA signals near the original FDMA frequencies, with one fuzzy signal located at 1242 mhz in the L2 band as well as two signals in the L1 band at 1575
42 mhz
 ; Subsequent GLONASS-KM satellites launched after 2015 will display the free signal in the L5 band at 1176
45 mhz and will also use more CDMA signals at current frequencies
 saanchaa:glonass satellites roadmap Although the format and modulation of GLONASS CDMA has not been finalized yet, the initial statements from the developers suggest that BOC modulation at 1575
42 mhz will be used for the free signal in the L1 band, free in the L3 band
 QPSK modulation centered at 1202
025 mhz will be used for the signal and free signal in L5 band To be used in concentrated BOC modulation at 1176
45 mhz
 Two of these signals are essentially equivalent modernized GPS civilian signals "neo-civilian L1" and gps-formatted signals located at the focal points of "life safety" located near existing Galileo and compass signals and L3 band signal L2 The band is located just below the "m-code" signal of modernized GPS

 taapan coil ke liye, garm pani or bhaap sabase aam hai or udhaahrantah is garm drav kii boyler dwaara aapurti kii jaati he
 For cooling coils, the most common are cold water and refrigerators
 Cold water is supplied from a coolant that may be located far away, but the refrigerant must come from the nearest condensing unit
 jab prasheetak kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, vaashp-sampeden prashithan chakra main shitalan coil vashpak he
 HVAC coils that use this direct-expansion of refrigerants are commonly called DX coils
 HVAC coylon ke vaayu kii ore, taapan or prashithan ke liye prayukt ke bich ek mahatvapurn antar maujuud rahata he
 Because of manometry, moisture is condensed out of the air that is cooled, except in extremely dry airflow
 The heating of some air increases the ability of that air to hold water

 Heat exchangers, not typical in direct-combustion furnaces present in many homes, are 'coils'
 bajaay iske ve gas se hawa taap vinimayak hai, jo aam taur par kate steel shit dhaatu ke bane hote hai
 Combustion products pass through one side of these heat exchangers and air to be conditioned from the other side
 Therefore, a cracked heat exchanger is a dangerous situation that needs immediate attention, as it allows combustion products to enter the building

 SHE is often used in the heating of liquids that include solids and thus have a tendency to block the interior of the heat exchanger
 nune daab giravat SHE ko aasaani se avaruddhata ko sanbhaalane kii kshamta detii he
 The SHE uses an "auto-cleaning" mechanism, under which the blocked surfaces locally increase fluid velocity, thereby increasing the dredging on the blocked surface, thus helping to remove the resistor and keep the heat exchanger clean 
 "taap antaran kii sataha banane vaali aantarik diwaar aksar moti hoti he, jo SHE ko kaafii majboot banaati he or pratikul pariveshon main lambey samay tak tiki rahati hai
 "they can be cleaned easily by opening them like a furnace, where any deposits deposited can be removed by pressure washing

 audyogic durghatnaayen udyog main karyrat vyaktiyon tak hi simit hoti he, jinka sambandh yantra-chaalan tathaa parivahan-chaalan se hota he
 The origin of these accidents is due to faulty conditions related to work and worker
 durghatana kii paribhaasha kaaryon evam paristhitiyon ke anuroop badalati rahati he
 Modern psychologists view the accident in a new way
 unka mat he ki alag-alag deshon main shram kanoon bhi alag-alag hai isliye durghatana kii paribhaasha bhi badalati rahati he
 There was a time when the accident was considered to be the cause of divine inspiration
 vigyaan ke vikaas or udyog main manovigyaan ke aagaman se is puraani manyata ko nirarthak mana gaya
 This problem got the attention of scholars, gradually this question was seriously considered in the industrial sector
 vidwaanon ne durghatana se sambandhit mahatvapurn pradatton kaa sankalan kar ise apane shodhakarya kaa mukhya vishay bana diya
 Western countries made a lot of progress in this direction
 bharat ke vidwaanon ne mahatvapurn tathyon ko sarsaadhaaran ke samaksh prastut kiya
 Accident is considered a curse in modern industries
 in durghatnaon se udyog main baari kshati hoti rahati he
 Following are the causes of the accident - durghatnayen nimnlikhit pravidhiyon ko apanaakar roki ja sakati hai - In common use, an antibiotic or antibiotic is a substance or compound that kills or inhibits bacterial growth
 pratijaivik roganurodhi yogicon kaa vyapak samooh hota he, jiskaa upyog kavak or protojoa sahit sookshmdarshi dwaara dekhe jane vaale jeevanuon ke kaaran hue sankraman ke ilaaj ke liye hota he
 The term "antibiotic" was used by Selman Waxman in 1942 to refer to solids or liquids produced by a single microbe, which are opposed to the growth of other microorganisms at high concentrations
 is mul paribhaasha main prakritik rup se praapt hone vaale thos yaa taral padaarth nahin hai, jo jeevanuon ko maarane main sakasham hote hai, par sookshmjivon dwaara utpann nahin kiye jate or inamen salphonamide jaise synthetic jeevanurodhi yogic bhi nahin hote hai
 Many antibiotics are relatively small molecules, weighing less than 2000 Da
 aushadhiy rasayan vigyaan kii pragati ke saath-saath ab adhiktar antibioticssemi synthetichi hai, jinhen prakruti main paye jane vaale mul yogicon se rasinic rup se sanshodhit kiya jaataa he, jaisaa ki betalactom ke maamle main hota he
 Some antibiotics are still produced by living organisms such as aminoglycosides and are isolated and made from other purely artificial methods - such as sulfonamides, quinolones, and oxazolidinones
 utpatti par aadhaarit is vargeekaran- prakritik, semisynthetic or synthetic ke atirikt sookshmjivon par unke prabhaav ke anusaar pratijaivik ko mote taur par do samoohon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa hai: ek to ve, jo jeevanuon ko maarthe hai, unhen jeevanunashak agent kaha jaataa he or jo bacteria ke vikaas ko durbal karte hai, unhen bacterostatic agent kaha jaataa he
 Before the beginning of the twentieth century, the treatment of many infectious diseases was based on pharmacological proverbs
 pracheen chini chikitsa main sankraman ke ilaaj ke liye paudhon se praapt pratijaivik tatwon kaa upyog 2,500 saal pehle shuru hua
 Many ancient civilizations such as ancient Egypt, ancient Greeks and medieval Arabia used fungi and plants to treat infections
 17 veen sadi menkunain kii chaal kaa upyog malaria ke ilaaj ke liye vyapak rup se hota tha, jo rogajinas plasmodium ke protozon paraseete ke kaaran hota he
 Scientific efforts to understand why diseases occur, the development of synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy and the isolation of natural antibiotics proved to be milestones in the development of antibiotics
 multah antibiosis kahe jane vaale pratijaivik waisi dawaaen hai, jo bacteria ke khilaaf kaam karti hai
 The term antibiosis means "against life" and was introduced by the French bacteriologistvillemin to describe the effect of these drugs
 And after the discovery of antibiotic penicillin, the use of salvarsan as an antibiotic came to an end
 arleach ke kaaryon, jisase pratijaivik kranti kaa janm hua, ke baad 1932 main domeck ne prontosil kii khoj kii
 pehle vyavsaayik rup se uplabdh jeevanurodhi pratijaivik prontosil kaa vikaas gerhard domeck kii aguwai vaali ek team ne germany ke IG farban kanglomaret keber prayogshaalaon main kiya
 Prontosil showed a relatively widespread effect on Gram-positive cocci and was not even against intraobacteria
 is pehali salphonamide dawa ke vikaas se pratijaivik dawaaon ke yug kii shuruyaat hui
 The discovery of antibiotics produced by natural microorganisms was influenced by earlier work on the inspection of antibiosis among microbes
 pashchar ne kaha 'ki agaraham kuch bacteria ke bich paraspar virodh kii prakriya main hastkshep kar sakate hai to isse 'shaayad chikitsa vigyaan ke liye kaaphi ummiden paidaa hongi
 penicillium spp ke bacteria ke paraspar virodh kaa sabase pehla varnan jon tindan ne 1875 main england main kiya
 However, his work did not receive much attention by the scientific community until Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928
 Even then the therapeutic potential of penicillin was not fully believed
 uske das saal baad, ernest chen or harvard flore ne bi
 brevis dwaara khoje gayi va jarmicidin naam diye gayi ek anya prakritik pratijaivik padaarth kii khoj ke baad fleming ke kaam main ruchi lee
 1939 main, rene dubose ko jarmicidin ko dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan ghaav or ulcer ke ilaaj main prayog kii gayi pehali vyavsaayik rup se utpaadit pratijaivik dawa ke rup main kargar sabit hone ke rup main alag pahchaan mili
 flore or chaiyn ne penicillin ko shuddh karne main kamyaabi pai
 is shuddh kiye gayi pratijaivik ne jeevanuon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa ke khilaaf jeevanurodhi gatividhi kaa pradarshan kiya
 It also had low toxicity and could be taken without causing adverse effects
 iske alaava, isaki gatividhi mawaad jaise jaivik ghatakon se avaruddh nahin hoti thi, jaisaa ki us samay uplabdh synthetic pratijaivik salphonamide ke prayog se hota tha
 The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented
 pencilin ke vikaas ne samaan kshamtaaon vaale pratijaivik yogicon kii khoj ke prati nai ruchi paidaa kii
 penicillin kii unki khoj ke kaaran ernest chen, harvard flore ko 1945 main sanyukt rup se nobel puraskaar pradaan kiya gaya
 Florey credited dubose with starting the search for antibacterial compounds wholeheartedly and systematically
 a similar method led to the discovery of germicidin, which revived Florey's discovery in penicillin
 roganurodhi chikitsa ke safal parinaam ke liye ek pratijaivik kii gatividhiyon kaa moolyankan mahatvapurn he
 Factors of non-microbe viruses, such as host immunity mechanisms, location of infection, present as a disease are subtle components of intrinsic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic antibiotics
 mul rup se pratijaivik dawaaon kaa vargeekaran aise ho saktaa he ki jo jeevanuon ke khilaaf ghaatak yaa jeevanunashak karrwai karte hai yaa ve jo bacterostatic he, jinka kaam jeevanuon kii vruddhi ko rokna he
 Antibiotic activity of antibiotics is dependent on their phased growth and not all, but in most cases the "destructive" potential of the drug requires the division of cells during the action of antibiotic antibiotics
 ye vargeekaran prayogshaala main dikhe vyavhaar par aadhaarit he; vyaavhaarik rup se ye donon ek jeevanu ke sankraman ko khatm karne main sakasham hai
 Information on the 'in vitro activity' of the action of antibiotics, the minimum inhibitory concentration of antimicrobial and antimicrobial potency for activity evaluation are excellent indicators of antimicrobial ability
 haalanki, chikitsakeey gatividhi main, akele ye kadam nidanmoolak parinaamon kii bhavishyavaanee ke liye aparyaapt hai
 The combination of the pharmacokinetic profile of an antibiotic with the antimicrobial activity has shown significant signs of drug effectiveness in many pharmacological parameters
 pratijaivik dawaaon kii gatividhi ekaagratha par nirbhar he or unki roganurodhi gatividhi uttarottar roganurodhi pratijaivik sandratha ke saath badhati jaati he
 They may also be based on time, where their antimicrobial activity does not increase with an increase in antibiotic concentrations, however, it is also important that the minimum inhibitory concentration serum be maintained for a specific period
 Laboratory evaluation of the antibacterial elements used to kill Curvis is useful in determining actimicrobial activity based on timing or concentration
 aamtaur par pratijaivik dawaaon kaa vargeekaran unki karrwai ke tantra, rasinic sanrachana yaa gatividhi ke spectrum ke aadhaar par hota he
 Most antibiotics target the function of bacteria or their growth process
 pratijaivik dawaaen, jo bacteria kii koshika diwaar yaa koshika jhilli, yaa aavashyak jeevanu anzime par lakshya kendrit karti hai, saamanyat: jeevanunashak prakruti kii hoti hai
 Those that target protein synthesis, such as aminoglycosides, microlides, and tetracycline, are usually bacteriostatic and have a specific classification based on their targets: such as "compressed spectrum antibiotics" in particular types of bacteria, such as Gram negative, Or targets Gram-positive bacteria, while broad-spectrum antibiotics Affect a wide range
 pichley kuch varshon main pratijaivik dawaaon ke teen nae varg nidaan ke liye istemaal kiye ja rahe hai
 Thus, it has taken 40 years to discover new classes of antibiotic compounds
 in nai pratijaivik dawaaon ke nimnlikhit teen varg hai: cyclic lipopapatids, glicilsiclins ,or oxajolidinons 
 tigeciclin ek vyapak spectrum pratijaivik he, jabaki do anya kaa upyog gram-positive sankraman ke ilaaj ke liye hota he
 These developments can be seen as an expectation of a means of measuring bacterial resistance to current antibiotics
 1939 main pehali baar flore or chaiyn ke ahm prayaason ke baad se chikitsa main pratijaivik dawaaon ke mahatv ke kaaran inaki khoj or utpaadan ke liye shodh kii prerana mili he
 The process of production usually involves inspection and testing and modification of broad categories of microorganisms
 utpaadan kinvan ke jariye, aamtaur par majboot aerobics tareeke se kiya jaataa he
 Oral antibiotics are swallowed, while intravenous antibiotics are used in more severe cases, such as deep-seated systemic infections
 pratijaivik kaa prayog kabhi-kabhi baahar se bhi kiya jaataa he, jaise aankh main daali jane vaali dawaaen yaa maraham
 Although antibiotics are generally considered safe and well-tolerated, they are also widely associated with adverse effects
 dushprabhav kai tarah ke, vividh roopon vaale or puri tarah pratijaivik ke upyog or lakshyit kiye jane vaale sookshmjivon par nirbhar hote hai
 The safety profile of treatment with new drugs is not as established as the drugs used for many years
 pratikul prabhaav bukhaar or michali se lekar photodermatitis or anophilix jaise bade allergy tak ke rup main dikh sakate hai
 One of the most common side effects is pain, sometimes caused by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium difficile, and is caused by the antibiotic disturbing the normal balance of the intestinal flora
 rog paidaa karne vaale bacteria kii is tarah ativruddhi ko pratijaivik lene ke dauraan pro-biotic kii khuraaq lene khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 Antibiotics may also increase the number of bacteria that are normally present as components of the vaginal flora and may lead to the over-development of the genus Candida yeast in the vulva-vaginal area
 duusari dawaaon ke saath antarkriyasheeltaa se duusare parshv kuprabhavon bhi dikh sakate hai, jaise pranaligat corticosteroid ke saath ek quinolon pratijaivik lene se kandra kii kshati kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 It is estimated that some antibiotics interfere with the effectiveness of birth control pills in two ways
 antra flora main sanshodhan se estrogens ke avasorana main kami aa sakati he
 Secondly, taking hepatic liver enzymes increases the metabolism of the active ingredients of the pill and may affect the usefulness of the pill
 haalanki zyaadaatar adhyayanon ke jariye yah sanket miltaa he ki pratijaivik dawaaen garbhanirodhakon ke kaam main hastkshep nahin karti hai
 Although some percent of women experience less effect of birth control pills while taking antibiotics, the failure rate can be compared to women taking pills
 iske alaava, koi anya adhyayan nahin dikhataa he, jisase antim taur par pataa chale ki pet ke flora main vyavdhaan garbhanirodhak ko prabhavit karata he
 This may be caused by taking the oral contraceptive pill through the induction of liver enzymes by the antifungal drug grisofulvin and broad-spectrum antibiotic rifampicin
 isliye sifarish kii jaati he ki in antimicrobeales ke prayog se roganurodhi chikitsa ke dauraan atirikt garbhanirodhak upayon kaa sahaara lenaa chahie
 Alcohol can interfere with the activity of antibiotics or metabolites, which can affect the activity of liver enzymes, thereby eliminating the effect of antibiotics
 iske alaava, metronidazol, tinidazol, sifamendol, ketaconajol, latmoxef, sifoprajon, sefemenoksime or furajolidine jaise kuch pratijaivik alcohol ke saath pratikriya karte hai, jisase gambhir parshv kuprabhav, jinamein ulti, michali or saans kii takalif shaamil he, dikhte hai
 Therefore, alcohol should not be consumed while taking such antibiotics
 Additionally, alcohol consumption may decrease serum levels of doxycycline and erythromycin succinate under certain circumstances
 pratijaivik pratirodh kaa udbhav ek vikasshil prakriya he, jo jeev ke chayan par aadhaarit he or jisase pratijaivik dawaaon kii khuraaq ke liye jivit rahane kii kshamta main vruddhi hui he, jo pehle ghaatak hota tha
 Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which were once considered miraculous cures, are now shown to be less effective, as bacteria are becoming more resistant
 pratijaivik khud ek chaynaatmak dabaav ke rup main kaam karte hai, jo ek nishchit sankhya main pratirodhi jeevanuon ke vikaas kii anumati dete hai or phir saralata se nasht hone vaale jeevanuon ko jivit rakhte hai
 Antibiotic resistant mutant organisms already present within the bacterial population were demonstrated through the Luria – Delbrück experiment in 1943
 jeevanu kaa jivan aksar viraasat main mili pratirodh kaa parinaam hota he
 Any antibiotic resistance demands a biological price and the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria can be affected by decreased fitness along with resistance, which proves beneficial in keeping bacteria alive especially when antibiotics are not present
 haalanki, atirikt utparivarti jeev fitness kii keemat kii bharpai or in jeevanuon kaa astitv behaal rakhane main madad kar sakate hai
 The underlying molecular resistance mechanism leading to antibiotic resistance can vary
 jeevanu kii anuvanshik banaavat ke kaaran moolbhoot pratirodh swaabhaavik he bacterial gunasutra us protein ko encode karne main vifal ho saktaa he, jise pratijaivik nishaanaa banaata he
 Acquired resistance arises from changes in the bacterial chromosome or acquisition of additional chromosomal DNA
 pratijaivik utpaadit karne vaale jeevanu saral se jatil banane ke pratirohak tantra kaa hissaa hote hai, dekhne main unke jaise hi hote hai or pratijaivik pratirodhi upabhedon main sthanantarit ho sakate hai
 The spread of antibiotic resistance mechanisms occurs via horizontal genetic exchange through peak transmission of inherited changes from previous generations and genetic recombination of DNA
 pratijaivik pratirodh kaa plasmid dwaara vibhinn jeevanuon ke bich vinimay ho saktaa he, jo jeevanurodhi pratirodh ko incode karte hai or jisase ekaadhik pratijaivik kaa sah astitv sambhav hota he
 These plasmids may hold distinct genes with diverse resistance mechanisms and may belong to unrelated antibiotics, as they produce more plasmid multiple antibiotic resistance than one antibiotic transferred
 vaikalpik rup se bacteria ke bheetar anya pratijaivik kaa aapasi pratirodh tab hota he, jab chune gayi ek pratijaivik se zyada ke pratirodh ke liye jimmevaar vaisaa hi pratirodh tantra paidaa hota he
 Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics are a major factor in the emergence of resistant bacteria
 samasya tab or jatil ho jaati he, jab ek yogya chikitsak ke nirdeshon ke bina khud pratijaivik lenaa shuru karata he or krishi main vikaas pramotaron ke rup main pratijaivik kaa gaiyr-chikitsakeey upyog hota he
 Antibiotics frequently indicate where they are not needed, or that the use is incorrect or that the antibiotic given is of minor effect
 yah kuch vaise maamalon main bhi hota he, jahaan sankraman bina ilaaj ke bhi thik ho saktaa he
 Antagonists such as penicillin and erythromycin, which were once considered miraculous cures, began to emerge from the 1950s on resistance to its anti-inflammatory elements
 aspataalon main pratijaivik dawaaon ke chikitsiya upyog ko bahu-pratijaivik pratirodhi jeevanuon kii vruddhi ke saath joda jaataa he
 Common forms of antibiotic abuse include over-use of prophylactic antibiotics by the passengers, not taking into account the patient's weight and the antibiotics previously administered to them, as both destroy the effectiveness of antibiotics and even fail the entire course
 can do
 aisa pratijaivik likhte samay unhen lene ke antaraal kaa ullekh nahin karne, sankramit jeev ke puri tarah swasth hone ke liye aaraam kaa abhaav hone se bhi pratijaivik vifal ho sakate hai
 Doing so will help in increasing the population of bacteria with antibiotic resistance
 Inappropriate antibiotic treatment is a common form of antibiotic abuse
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan ke rup main, ham aam sardi-zukam ke liye viral sankraman dur karne vaali pratijaivik dawaaon ke istemaal ko le sakate hai, jiskaa us par koi asar nahin hota
shwaas nalika ke sankraman par kiye gayi ek adhyayan main paaya gaya ki chikitsakon ne marijon ke liye unheen pratijaivik dawaaon ko likhaa, jinpar unka vishwaas tha, haalanki ve har 4 main se ek hi rogi ke upyukt tha
 Multidisciplinary intervention by both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics
 shwaas nalika ke sankraman kaa sahaj nidaan ke liye pratijaivik dawaaon ke lene main 48 ghante kaa vilamb pratijaivik ke istemaal ko kam kar saktaa hai
 However, this strategy can decrease the feeling of satisfaction in the patient

 However, delays in regulatory and legislative action to limit the use of antibiotics are common, and include opposition to industries using or selling these antibiotics, as well as accidental contact between antibiotic use and viral incurable diseases
 Opposition to industries engaged in related research may also be involved
 do sangheey vidheyak sahit jan swasthya or medical sanghathanon ne samarthan kiya tha
 The European Union has banned the use of antibiotics as a growth promoting agent since 2003
 vartmaan main pratirodh kaa saamana karne ke dawa yogicon ke vikaas ke liye ek samaadhaan par anusandhan kiya ja rahaa he, jo kai pratijaivik pratirodh ko waapas kar saktaa he
 These so-called resistance modifying agents can target and inhibit the MDR mechanism, causing bacteria to be infested with antibiotics that were already present as resistant

 The Soviet Union declared disbanded on 25 December 1991
 is ghoshnaa main soviet sangh ke bhootpurv ganatantron ko swatantrat maan liya gaya
 Prior to the dissolution, Mikhail Gorovachev was the President of the Soviet Union
 vighatan kii ghoshnaa ke ek din purv unhone padatyag diya tha
 This process of disintegration is usually associated with the capture of Gorovachev
 vastav main soviet sangh ke vighatan kii prakriya bahut pehle shuru ho chuki thi
 There are many basic and historical reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union, which are not seen when looking at the surface
 1917 main bolshevik kranti ne soviet sangh naamak ek nae samyavaadee rajya ko janm diya
 With this, the Soviet Union made it clear in the beginning that the political system and communist organizations would be dependent on socialist ideology and communist Marxist world philosophy would be the only criterion to define the national interest
 yah swaabhaavik tha ki is krantikari samyavaadee rajya ko poonjeewaadi pashchimi rajyon ne apana janmajaat shatru samajha
 After Lenin's death in the 1920s and 30s, Stalin established himself as the supreme leader and the communist party's dictatorship was established in that country
 stallin ne apane virodhiyon kaa barbarta se unmoolan va daman kiya
 This led to the Soviet Union being identified as a state that violated democracy
 aage stallin kii mrityu ke baad bhi khushchev tathaa bragenev ke shashan main taanaashaahee pravritiyaan maujuud rahi
 Restrictions on civil liberties, administration, foreign travel etc
 continued
 ek tareeke se lok bhaavana par "lohe ke parde" daal die gaye the
 The dictatorship of the proletariat meant that the power should be in the hands of the proletariat
 mehanatakash janata ke buniyadi adhikaron kii guarantee tathaa rajya kii nitiyon ke nirmaan main unki bhagidaari ko sunishchit karnaa hi samaajawaadee prajatantr kaa saratatv tha
 The Soviet Union did not attempt to establish this democracy
 jiske falswaroop “sarvhaara varg kaa adhinaayakatv” sarvhaara varg par rajya va party main sheersh sthanon par asin netaaon ke adhinaayakatv main badal gaya
 The public became indifferent to the state and the system
 uski udaseenta evam aakrosh is seemaa tak pahunch gai, ki jab vyavastha kaa ant kiya gaya to uske bachaav main janata ke kisi bhi hisse se ek swar bhi nahin phuta
 Russia was not only geographically the largest state in the world but its population was multinational, reflecting the amazing diversity
 roosi jaaron ne is vistrut samrajya ko kendriya prashasan ke adheen karne kaa koi praytn nahin kiya kintu soviet samyavaadee party ne kendriyakaran karne kaa prayaas kiya or yah jaateey vividhta soviet sangh kii rashtriya ekta or akhandta ke liye khatra bani rahi
 The Soviet Communist Party was unable to find a solution to this entanglement
 sheet yuddh ke varshon main pashchimi shaktiyon kaa dushprachaar is chunauti ko visphotak banaata rahaa
 The urge for independence remained a concern for the Soviet Empire in all the eastern countries that the Soviet Empire had brought under its influence, such as Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Roumania, etc
 soviet sangh kii samyavaadee party ne aarthik vikaas kaa or saamaajik punarsarachna kaa jo vikalp saamne rakhaa tha vah bahut safal siddh nahin hua
 Critics such as Trotsky had long ago promoted Stalin's policy as a betrayal of socialism, and further Khurschev also condemned the Stalin and Stalin lawsuits
 isi khurshchev ke shashan kaal main maovadi china ne bhi yah laanchhan lagaana shuru kar diya ki soviet sangh samyavaadee krantikari rajya nahin rah gaya balki sudhaarwadi, pratigaami, avasarwaadi samjhautaparast takat ban chukaa he
 In this way, the Soviet leadership had lost the trust of its allied communist countries
 apane rashtrahit ko samuhik, rashtriya, krantikari hiton par tarjeeh dene vaala najar aane laga tha
 Whether it was the soviet-china dispute or the dissatisfaction in the communist countries of Eastern Europe, the result of all this proved to be a weakening of the Soviet Communists
 soviet union ke vighatan ke liye vahaan kii samyavaadee party kaa sheersh netritv bhi ek seemaa tak uttaradaayi rahaa
 Due to no distinction between party and state in the Soviet Union, the leadership of party and state was in their hands
 yah party netritv apane suvidhabhogi jivan, bhai-bhatijawad or bhrasht aacharan ke liye badnaam ho gaya tha
 As a result, Soviet leaders had lost their ideal form to the public
 jahaan tak aarthik vikaas kaa prashn he, bhale hi sainik or samrik kshetra main soviet uplabdhiyaan ameriganon ke baraabar tathaa kabhi-kabhaar unase badhkar najar aati rahi kintu is uplabdhi ne soviet sangh ke aarthik vruddhi dar ko bahut kam kar diya tha
 In fact, the competition of transferred research, wild spending on arms-making and interfering with the internal problems of other countries to maintain their sovereignty caused the Soviet Union's economy to falter
 itnaa hi nahin purvi europe main jo samaajawaadee rajya sthapit ho gaye the, unhen aarthik va sainik tathaa rajnatik madad karnaa bhi soviet union kii naitik jimmedaari thi
 It was also his policy to provide financial assistance to the economies of the newly independent countries, so that they would avoid going into the American camp
 in sab kaarnon se soviet sangh kii aarthik dasha patanonmukh hui
 The growth rate declined by 10% in the period 1970–85 of the Soviet Union
 yantron tathaa sajosman ke niryaat kaa ansh ghatata gaya
 Agricultural production, industrial production declined
 faltah upabhokta vastuon ke liye lambi-lambi line lagane lageen, nagarikon ke jivan str main giravat ai
 In this way, absence was common for the common consumer
 sheet yuddh ke dauraan pashchimi prachaar kaa jor yah pramanit karne main rahaa ki utpaadan or vitaran donon hi maamalon main samyavaadee pranali puri tarah asafal hui he
 In this atmosphere of scarcity, coupled with increased dissatisfaction of consumers, lack of freedom of expression and violation of human rights had made the Soviet system more painful
 america ke saath parmaanu nirmit astr-shastron main barabari kii mahatvakanksha ne soviet sangh kii arthvyavastha par kamartod boj daal diya
 The Soviet Union had to drastically increase its defense budget to make the Star Wars project announced at the time of President Reagan ineffective
 isi samay afghanistan main soviet sangh ne sainik hastkshep kiya
 This intervention not only put an economic burden on him but also made him unpopular
 isse soviet sangh antarrashtriya birdari main bilkul akelaa sa padaa gaya
 At the same time, a transformative movement began in Eastern Europe challenging the communist Soviet empire
 poland main “solidytary” naamak sainik sanghathan apane desh kii samyavaadee party se takaraane ke liye jujharu tevar dikhalaa rahaa tha or romania main chechescue ke bhrasht shashan ko samarthan dena kathin hota ja rahaa tha
 Mikhail Gorbachyob took charge in these situations
 11 march 1985 ko gorbachov ne soviet sangh kaa netritv grahan kiya or isi ke saath soviet samyavaadee itihaas kaa ek nayaa adhyay shuru hua
 Gorbachev announced his specific policies to improve Russia's economic condition and to strengthen communism positively, known as Uskorenyi Perestroika and Glasnost
 gorbachov kaa uddeshy in avadharanaon ke madhyam se soviet vyavastha main amulchul parivartan laana tha
 His attempt was to provide a basis by bringing new changes in communism
 isi kaaran uske dwaara laae parivartanon ko duusari soviet kranti ke aagaman kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 According to Gorbachev, the erstwhile Soviet economy was suffering from inferior goods, inefficiency and lack of rivalry
 logon ke saamne prastut kii jane vaali vastuon va sevaaon tathaa unke dwaara maang kii jane vaali vastuon va sevaaon main antar tha
 In this way, it was believed that Uskoreni would change the structure of the economy in such a way that the satisfaction of the needs of the people would be more dynamic, efficient and social oriented
 iske tahat adhik sansadhano ke istemaal kii apeksha kaarykushalta main vruddhi kar utpaadan badhaane par jor dene kii baat kii gai
 Perestroika means - through restructuring or restructuring, it pledged to bring such reforms in the society by ending the old rigidities to pave the way for the economic, social, political, cultural and spiritual development of man
 is prakaar yah ek nae samaaj kii ore agrasar hone kii prakriya thi
 The following things are covered under the Perestroika- saamaajik-aarthik pragati main teji laana
 Extensive democratization of society
 loktantric vikendrikaran karnaa
 To develop moral and spiritual development of a person
 samaaj kii vikrutiyon kaa pardaafash karnaa
 In this way, Perestroika's aim was to expand a society where the dignity and pride of human is at the center, the prestige of human values
 gorbachov ne perestroika ke antargat krishi kshetra main sudhaar, lij evam conteract ke madhyam se nijee kheti ko protsaahan diya
 In agriculture, cooperative organization was given more importance than collective organization because it keeps the motivation of the person to work
 isi prakaar upabhokta udyogon kaa vikaas kiya gaya, mazdooree vetan ko utpaadakta se joda gaya tathaa kaary kushal shramikon ko adhik vetan tathaa suvidhaayen pradaan kii gai
 Similarly, by bringing changes in the policy related to technology and investment, there was a deep structural restructuring of the economy
 arthvyavastha ko gatiheenata se nikaalkar sudrudh evam teevr vikaas ke path par chalaane kii koshish kii
 Through Perestroika, Gorbachev wanted to move the Soviet Union towards a new society
 is nae samaaj kaa punanirmaan vah lenin kii vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par karnaa chaahate the
 These policies were widely opposed by status quoists
 glasnost kaa arth he- 'khulaapan'
 Under Glasnost, open debate was encouraged to strengthen the powers of democracy
 gorbachov ne is baat par bal diya ki glasnost kaa vistaar sabhi karya main niyojan or prashasan main kiya jaae tathaa desh main pradeshik, aarthik, jaateey, yuva varg sambandhi, parivesh sambandhi saamaajik va anya samasyaon par khuli bahes kii jaae taaki logon kii sahi vah sunishchit raay kaa pataa chal sake
 Gorbachev also said that we need glassnasts in the same way as air
 glasnost ke madhyam se samaajwaad ko loktantr kii raah par chalanaa tha
 In fact, for the social, economic, political transformation which was talked about under the broad concept of Perestroika and the attempt to reconstruct a society in which people participate in this transformation, it was necessary for the meaning of openness
 isi kaaran yah kaha gaya ki bina glasnot ke perestroika nahin or loktantr nahin
 The Glasnost process was virtually a challenge because a bonded society was not used to being in the open
 1
 glasnost or perestronika shabd hi nahin balki parivartan ke pratik ban gaye
 At every turn of Soviet society, change began to occur, political prisoners were released
 2
 desh main khuli bahes hone lagi
 The Soviet people gained new experience of multi-party elections
 3
 soviet nagarikon ko videsh yatra evam naagarik avrajanon kii chhot mili
 4
 Changes in foreign policy were brought and stress was given importance to the place of cold war
 5
 sudhaar kaaryakramon dwaara soviet samaaj ko kathor anushaasan tathaa louh aavaran kii niti se mukti mili
 6
 This open debate was also misused in the Soviet Union and through this people got involved in factionalism and narrow interests
 isi dauraan ganraajyon ne adhik swaittata kii maang rakhi
 Together the Soviet Union was formed
 kuch ganraajya to puri tarah swatantra hona chaahate the

 The administration became inactive in tug of war between democratic elements and radical communists
 algaavvaad hinsaatmak rup main bhadak uthaa, soviet sangh araajaktaa kii kagaar tak pahunch gaya
 In August 1991, some communist leaders tried unsuccessfully to overthrow
 faltah soviet sangh ke vighatan kii prakriya tej ho gai
 And eventually he was shattered
 gorbachov ne tyaagptr de diya
 And in place of the Soviet Union, 15 independent republics were born in December 1991
 jahaan tak gorbachov or unki nitiyon ke falswaroop soviet sangh ke vidyaton kaa sambandh he to yah kaha ja saktaa he uski nitiyon ne soviet sangh ke vighatan kii prakriya ko puraa kiya
 His policy weakened the central power of the Soviet Union, as a result, the powers of the Soviet Union to fight against the center increased
 gorbachov kii tathakthith janatantric nitiyon ne ganraajyon ke soviet sangh se alag hone ko manyata de di
 As a result, the republics of the Soviet Union became independent and the Soviet Union disintegrated
 yah gorbachov kii nitiyon kaa hi parinaam tha ki soviet samyavaadee dal kii shakti main nirantar hraas hota gaya
 As a result, the power of the largest contact formula, which binds the formula of unity of the Soviet Union, decreased
 iskaa parinaam tha samyawad-virdohi shaktiyon kaa sir uthaanaa
 The United States and Western countries also supported these powers that broke the Soviet Union
 parinamswaroop ye shaktiyaan soviet sangh kii ekta ko khokhli karti gai
 Gorbachev did not make any effort to stop the fortification of communism from collapsing in Eastern Europe, on the contrary his policies continued to dominate anti-communist powers in Eastern Europe
 checkoslovakia, romania, hungary, purvi germany me samyawad kaa patan ho gaya or yah patan ne soviet sangh ke mahashakti kii chhavi ko samaapt kar diya
 It is easy to say that Sir Gorbachev is responsible for the collapse and the end of the Soviet Union
 aisa karnaa kisi ek vyakti ko aitihaasik pravritiyon se mahatvapurn samajhane kii bhul karnaa hoga
 Gorbachev was just a mirror reflecting these historical trends, which shattered itself
 vastav main soviet sangh ke vighatan ke bich uski sthapana ke saath hi bo die gaye the
 In order to keep the socialist system alive, it was necessary that a socialist man and culture be born in the country, the Soviet system failed to do so
 stallin ke shashan kaal main lagbhag do dashakon tak soviet sangh kii ekta kendra sarkaar kii nirmam bal prayog vaale anushaasan se hi barkaraar rahi thi
 Different parts of the country were forced to make sacrifices in the national interest or on the pretext of international brotherhood to protect communism, it was not that dissatisfaction or outrage did not arise, but because of oppressive policies, their vocal expression was difficult
 gorbachov kii udaar nitiyon ne is aakrosh ko vyakt karne kii maarg uplabdh karaayaa

 Ramlila is a drama based on the character of Rama traditionally played in northern India
 yah praayah vijayadashami ke avasar par khelaa jaataa he
 From the sea to Himachal, who is the original promoter of the famous Ramlila is a controversial question
 bhavuk bhakton kii drushti main yah anadi he
 a legend indicates that in the Treta Yuga, after the demise of Sri Ramachandra, the Ayodhya residents spent fourteen years of performing the leelas of Ram
 tabhi se isaki parampara kaa prachlan hua
 Another public opinion proves that its original promoter was Megha Bhagat, who is believed to be a resident of Phuthe Hanuman located in the Katuapur palace of Kashi
 ek baar purushottam ramchandra ji ne inhen swapn main darshan dekar lila karne kaa aadesh diya taaki bhakt janon ko bhagwaan ke chakshush darshan ho saken
 He got Ramlila done by getting inspiration from this
 tatprenamswaroop thik bharat milaap ke mangal avasar par aradhy dev ne apni jhalak dekar inaki kaamana purna kii
 According to the opinion of some people, Goswami Tulsidas, the founder of the acting tradition of Ramlila, started it by finding lack of mass entertainment plays in Hindi
 inaki prerana se ayodhya or kaashi ke tulsi ghat par pratham baar ramlila hui thi
 From theatrical point of view, there are three types of Ramleela - Sachal Leela, Achal Leela and Stay Leela
 kaashi nagari ke chaar sthanon main achal leelaayen hoti hai
 go
 One of the many characteristics of theater established by Tulsidas is that for the creation of naturalness, effectiveness and beauty, Ayodhya, Janakpur, Chitrakoot, Lanka etc
 were made in different places and all the leelas belonging to the same place were shown in one place
 Used to go
 yah gyatavya he ki rangashaala khuli hoti thi or paatro ko samvaad jodne ghataane main swatantraaa thi
 In this way, the credit for the reputation of Hindi theater is Go

 ramlila ke sabhi abhinayta praaia: brahman hote hai, kintu ab kahin kahin anya varnon ke bhi log dekhe jate hai
 Special attention is paid to Ravana's poetic grandeur, Sita's natural tenderness and eloquent softness, Shurpanakha's physical length, etc
 while choosing the characters
 lilabhinayta chaoupaayiyon, dohon ko kanthsth kiye rahete hai or yathavsar cathopakathanon main upyog kar dete hai
 Ramleela's success depends on Vyas Sutraghar, who handles it, as he directs the dynamics of the dialogues and the actors

 a certain method is accepted at the beginning of Ramlila

 Somewhere it is done by worshiping the crowns of God, and elsewhere it is done by legislation

 Along with this, the sword handling, maneuver, weapons, etc
 of men dressed as Kali are worth seeing
 ramlila main nrity, sangeet kii pradhanta nahin hoti kyonki charitnayak gambhir, vir, dheer, shaleen evam maryadapriy purushottam hai
 As a result, special kind of seriousness remains in the environment

 gandaraditya kii maut ke samay unke bete maduranthaka bachche the isliye unke bhai arinjay ko singhaasana par baithaaya gaya tha
 After Arinjaya's death, his son Parantaka II, Sundar Chola was seated on the throne
 unke do bete, aditya karikaalan or arulmojhi varman or ek beti kundawai thi
 At the beginning of the story, Emperor Sundar Chola is shown to be sick and disabled
 aditya karikaalan uttari kaman ke general he or kanchi main rahete he or arulmojhivarman yuddh main srilanka main he or unki bahan kundawai piratti pajayaarai main chol raja ke ghar main rahati hai

 The most memorable of these is Nandini, who is said to have the power to impress any man in her beauty
