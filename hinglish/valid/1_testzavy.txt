 swami vivekananda ne prachlit shiksha ko 'nishedhaatmak shiksha' kii sangya dete hue kaha he ki aap us vyakti ko shikshit maanate hai jisane kuch parikshaayen uteern kar lee hon tathaa jo achche bhaashan de saktaa ho, par vaastaviktaa yah he ki jo shiksha jansadharan ko jivan sangharsh ke liye taiyaar nahin karti, jo charitra nirmaan nahin karti, jo samaaj seva kii bhaavana viksit nahin karti tathaa jo sher jaisaa saahas paidaa nahin kar sakati, aisi shiksha se kya laabh? Therefore, Swamiji was not in favor of theoretical education, he considered practical education useful to the person
 vyakti kii shiksha hi use bhavishya ke liye taiyaar karti he, isliye shiksha main un tatwon kaa hona aavashyak he, jo uske bhavishya ke liye mahatvapurn ho
 In the words of Swami Vivekananda, swami ji shiksha dwaara loukik evam parloukik donon jivan ke liye taiyaar karnaa chaahate hai
 In relation to education from a secular point of view, he has said that 'we need such education, which constitutes character, increases the strength of the mind, develops the intellect and makes the person self-reliant
 ' parloukik drushti se unhone kaha he ki 'shiksha manushya kii anternihit purnataa kii abhivyakti he
 ' swami vivekananda ke shiksha darshan ke aadharbhoot siddhanth nimnlikhit hai – 1

 The routine function of the blood corpus involves testing blood of both donors and recipients so that each recipient receives the blood that is as appropriate and as safe as possible if there is a blood transfusion between the donor and the recipient of a unit of incompatible blood
 Immunological reactions, hemolysis, renal failure and shock are likely and death is also a possibility

 The danger can be further reduced by cross-matching the blood, but lock it when blood is needed for an emergency
 For cross-matching, donor and recipient blood are mixed and tested to allow the mixture to attach or to form clots if clear attached to the naked eye
 If not, technologists usually use a microscope to examine it
 If agglutination occurs, that donor's blood cannot be transfused to the recipient
 The blood corpus is required to correctly identify all blood samples

 a pregnant woman can produce igg blood group antibodies if her abdominal baby has a blood group antigen that she does not have
 This is likely if the baby's blood cells in the abdomen have passed into the mother's blood circulation or ever Sometimes after medical transfusion this may result in Rh disease or other forms of hemolytic disease of the newborn in the current pregnancy and / or subsequent pregnancies if possible

 parinamswarup bairam khan haj ke liye ravaanaa ho gayi
 Bairam Khan stayed in Patan, Gujarat, and sat on the beach after boating at Patan's famous Sahasraling Sarovar, with the intention of offering an Afghan chieftain Mubarak Khan and deceitfully killed Bairam Khan
 yah mubarak khan ne apane pita kii mrityu kaa badla lene ke liye kiya
 This incident made Bairam Khan's family an orphan
 in dhokhebaajon ne sirf katl hi nahin kiya, balki kaaphi lutpaat bhi machaaya
 Widow Sultana Begum, along with some of her servants, escaped to Ahmedabad
 akbar ko ghatana ke bare main jaise hi maaloom hua, unhone sultanaa begum ko darbar waapas aane kaa sandesh bhej diya
 After getting the message on the way, Begum entered Akbar's court
 aise samay main akbar ne apane mahanata kaa saboot dete hue inako badi udaartaa se sharan diya or rahim ke liye kaha “ise sab prakaar se prasann rakho
 He must not know that his father, Khan Khana is no more
 baba jambur ko kaha yah hamaara betaa he
 Put it in front of our eyesight
 is prakaar akbar ne rahim kaa paalan- poshan ekadam dharm- putr kii bhaanti kiya
 a few days later, Akbar married widow Sultana Begum
 akbar ne rahim ko shahi khandaan ke anurup “mirza khan’ kii oopaadhi se sammanit kiya
 Rahim's education - initiation was in accordance with Akbar's liberal secular policy
 isi shiksha-diksha ke kaaran rahim kaa kavy aaj bhi hindooon ke gale kaa kaniihaar bana hua he
 According to Dinkar Ji's statement, Rahim gave many times more space in his poems than the place Akbar gave to Hinduism in his deen-elahi
 rahim ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki vah dharm se musalmaan or samskruti se shuddh bhartiya the
 After the abolition of Rahim's education, Emperor Akbar, while following the tradition of his father Humayun, got Rahim married to Mahaban, sister of Mirza Aziz Koka, Bairam Khan's adversary
 is vivaah main bhi akbar ne vahi kiya, jo pehle karata rahaa tha ki vivaah ke sambandhon ke badaulat aapasi tanaav va puraani se puraani katutaa ko samaapt kar diya karata tha
 Because of Rahim's wedding Beram Kha and Mirza's ongoing estrangement is finished
 rahim kaa vivaah lagbhag solah saal kii umr main kar diya gaya tha
 One of the principal posts to Akbar's court was the post of Mir Arj
 yah pad paakar koi bhi vyakti raaton raat amir ho jaataa tha, kyonki yah pad aisa tha, jisase pahunchakar hi janata kii fariyaad samraat tak pahunchati thi or samraat ke dwaara liye gaye faisle bhi isi pad ke jariye janata tak pahunchaae jate the
 New people were appointed to this post every two-three days
 samraat akbar ne is pad kaa kaam- kaaj sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye apane sachche tathaa vishwaas paatr amir rahim ko mustakil mir arj niyukt kiya
 The whole court was stunned upon hearing this decision
 is pad par asin hone kaa matlab tha ki vah vyakti janata evam samraat donon main saamaanya rup se vishwasaneey he
 After much effort and blessings, Akbar could get a boy, whom he named Salim, with the blessings of Sheikh Salim Chishti
 shahjada saleem maan-baap or duusare logon ke adhik dulaar ke kaaran shiksha ke prati udasin ho gaya tha
 Akbar got many great people engaged in Salim's education
 in mahaan logon main sher ahamed, mir kalaan or darbari vidwaan abulfjal the
 Despite the efforts of all the people, Shahzada Salim did not mind studying
 akbar ne sadaa kii tarah apana aakhri hathiyaar rahim khaane khaanaa ko saleem kaa atali niyukt kiya
 It is said that Rahim was very happy to get this glory
 rahim ne avadhi or brajabhasha donon main hi kavita kii he jo saral, swaabhaavik or pravahpurn he
 In his poetry, there is adornment, calm and humor
 doha, soratha, barbai, kavitt or savaiya unke priy chand hai

 The Kanti Thermal Power Plant came into existence in 1985 with the efforts of the then MP of Muzaffarpur, George Fernandes
 1978 main jorge kaa pehla kaarykaal mujffarpur ke saansad ke rup main shuru hua
 In November 2014, the Kanti plant was renamed as George Fernandes Thermal Power Plant to acknowledge his contribution

 This is the first generation in 11 years since 2002 google image lebler, google image khoj kii, khel ke rup main ek suvidha he, jo google ke image khoj parinaamon kii gunvattta sudhaarney main madad ke liye upyogkarta dwaara yadrichhik chhaviyon ko label karnaa anumat karata he
 On 31 August 2006, Google launched the service as a beta
 louis won ohn ne ESP khel viksit kiya, jo ek aisa khel he jisamen do logon ko ek saath chhavi di jaati he, jo prayek chitra ke maiching label ke bare main jaanane yaa sanket karne ke alaava ek duusare se samvaad nahin kar sakate
 ESP khel google image lebler ke rup main google dwaara license praapt he
 Over time, players have seen various subtle changes in the game
 praarambhik maheenon main, lagbhag november, 2006 tak, aap chhavi par mouse rakhane par khel ke dauraan apane saathi ke anumaan dekh sakate the
 When "spontaneous abuse" started, you could see during play if your partner was using those words
 khel parivartit kiya gaya taaki aap keval khel ke ant main "saathi ke anumaan dekhen" par clic kar sakate the or jaan sakate the ki usne kya tip kiya tha
 The "spontaneous abuse" was finally halted in February 2007 by changes in the game's structure
 2007 ke shuruuaati kuch maheenon ke dauraan niyamit khilaadi chhaviyon ke samooh ko pahchaanane lage jo "robot" saathi ko, hameshaa ek hi kram main ekasmaan labalon ko suchit karata tha
 It is estimated to have changed from 13 March 2007
 achaanak dekhi gai adhikansh chhaviyaan bilkul nai hai or puraani chhaviyaan vyapak aseemit soochiyon ke saath aati hai
 As of 4 May 2007 the game has undergone fundamental and significant changes
 ab khilaadiyon ke paas 90 second ke bajaay, 2 minute hai
 Instead of 100 points per image, there is variety in digits to reward high specificity
 "aadmi" ko 50 ank mil sakate hai, jabaki "bill gates" ko 140 ank mil sakate hai
 On 7 August 2007, another change was made
 match ke dauraan prayek match ke ankon kaa maan dikhaane ke badale, khel ke ant main prayek match ke maan maiching shabd ke baazuu dikhaae jate hai
 This makes it very easy to see the correct value of specific vs
 general labeling
 ek or parivartan 15 oktober 2007 ko dekha gaya
 The new version seems to have been released and then withdrawn
 nae sanskaran main aap keval us chhavi ko dekh sakate hai jise aap label kar rahe hai, jabaki puraane sanskaran main jaise-jaise aap khelte hai chhaviyon ko screen ke nichle hisse main ekatrit kiya jaataa tha
 Other changes are subtle, for example in the new version the digits are in green letters and in the old version in red
 The most important change is that during image conversion the clock freezes and the time used is essentially reduced to two minutes of play
 ye parivartan 18 oktober 2007 se puri tarah lagu kiye gaye nazar aate hai
 a user pair is randomly merged with a partner who lives online and uses this feature
 upyogkarta panjikrut khilaadi ho sakate hai, jo sabhi khele gaye games ke kul ank sanchit kar sakate hai yaa mehmaan ho sakate hai jo ek baar main keval ek game khelte hai
 Note that players come from all over the world, some of whom may be practicing their own English, ie American and British English
 jab khilaadiyon kii ek asmaan sankhya online par hon, to khilaadi ko pehle se record kiye gaye shabdon ke samooh ke khilaaf khelnaa hoga
 Existing rules apply
 niyamon main parivartan ke liye, itihaas anubhag dekhen
 2 minute kii avadhi main, upyogkarta or uske saathi ko chhaviyon kaa ek hi set dikhaaya jayega or unke dwaara dekhi gai prayek chhavi kaa varnan karne tak yatha sambhav label pradaan karne ke liye kaha jayega
 jab upyogkarta kaa label saathi ke label se match ho, to donon ko ank praapt honge or ve samay samaapt hone tak agali chhavi par ja sakate hai
 It is possible to skip an image and proceed but both users have to agree to do so
 jawaab kii vishistataa ke aadhaar par 50 se 150 ke bich ank paa sakate hai
 150 digits is rare, but 140 digits can be given for a name or a specific word, even if the word is present in the spelling of the image
 "ped" yaa "aadmi" jaisi kam vishistataa vaale shabdon ke liye keval 50 ank arjeet kiye ja sakate hai
 Accuracy is never tested, so if both players typed "jupiter" to image Saturn, they would probably both score 140
 jin labalon par pichley upyogkartaaon dwaara sahmati vyakt kii gai ho, unhen "seemaa se pare" suchi main dikhaaya ja saktaa he or khel ke daur main unka istemaal nahin ho saktaa he
 Some players feel that the game shakes the image's appearance and sometimes it takes words typed by the first player to create a "beyond the limit" list for the other player
 duusare shabdon main, seemaa se pare shabd ekatarfa, visham ho sakate hai
 This certainly explains the frequent presenting condition when the partner seems to be unable to even think words like "car", "bird," or "girl"
 virale hi, match ke ant main yah spasht ho jaataa he ki donon khilaadiyon ke liye ek chhavi alag thi
 Perhaps it is just an error, or perhaps a test to see how quickly people get ahead when their details don't match, but it can be an implemented mechanism to look at people who cheat, when different images Let the words be the same
 Many times, a user's computer fails to load a new image, or continues to display the previously shown image
 aise samay par bhi donon khilaadiyon kii ore se paraspar "aage nikalne" kii zarurat paidaa hoti he
 After the 120 second time expires, the game is over
 upyogkarta pehali baar apane saathi upyogkarta kaa naam, khel ke liye unke ank or ab tak sanchit vyaktigat ank dekh sakate hai
 These are compared to daily high marks for teams and all-time individual high marks
 google darja paane vaali chhaviyon kii sankhya badhaane ke liye ucch ank tak pahunch paane main prayoktaaon kii pratispardhaatmakataa par daanv laga rahaa he
 At the end of the game, the screen shows all images presented during the game, including a list of labels guessed by the other player
 iske baad chhaviyaan swayan un websiton se link sthapit karti hai jahaan ve chhaviyaan pai gai thim or apni jigyaasa kii santushti ke liye tathaa adhik jaankaree hetu chaan-been kii ja sakati he
 The game is not designed for entertainment
 haalanki suvidha upyogkartaaon ke liye manoranjak he, tathaapi google ke liye yah sunishchit karne kii bhi chatur yukti he ki unke khoj shabdon kaa milan sahi chhaviyon se hota he
 Each word matched helps Google build the exact database used using Google image search
 maanav dwaara chhaviyon kii tanging ke bina, google image khoj ne ateet main chhavi ke sandarbh par bharosa kiya
 For example, a picture titled "bill Gates's Picture" may be potentially associated with the search term "bill Gates"
 google image lebler un logon par nirbhar karata he jo chhavi kaa arth yaa saamagree tag karte hai, na ki sandarbh khojate hai ki is chhavi kaa istemaal kahaan kiya gaya tha
 By storing more information about the image, Google stores many possible ways to search for an image in response to a user's search
 haalanki in niyamon ko khel ke screen khel par samajhaayaa nahin gaya he, darasal inamen se kuch madad prishth par spasht kiye gaye hai
 Other issues include: shuru karne ke ek maheene se bhi pehle, is khel kaa durupyog kiya jane laga
 prathit hota he ki nimnlikhit suchi ke shabdon dwaara google spam kaa shikaar ban rahaa tha: abrasives, accretion, bequeathing, carcinoma, congenita, diphosphonate, entrepreneurialism, forbearance, or googleny 
 kyonki khilaadi har daur ke ant main apane saathi kii pratikriya dekh sakate the, ve jaanane lage ki anya khilaadi in shabdon kaa prayog kar rahe hai
 Then some people included these words in their responses to entertain and increase points
 yatha 7 farvari 2007 ko google ne durupyog ko kam karne ke liye khel main parivartan kiye
 The above list filtered the words
 saath hi kuch aisi chhaviyaan jo yadrichhik shabdon ke liye prerak ban gai thim foran "aapkaa saathi aage nikalnaa chahta he" ke saath aane lageen
 13 march 2007 ko khel ke sanshodhan main, kuch samay ke liye "trigar imejon" ko hataa diya gaya lekin yatha 27 march se ve khel main waapas laut ai hai
 The disputes that the United Nations has succeeded in resolving so far have been described in this article

 Historically, ciphers were used for direct encryption or decryption
 inkaa istemaal kisi atirikt prakriya jaise pramanikaran yaa akhandta jaanch ke bina kiya jaataa tha
 In colloquial terms the term "code or code" is often used in the sense or concealment of any method of encryption

 The main classical cipher types are the transfer cryptography or transposition cipher, which rearranges the order of the characters in a message, and the substitution cypher
 It replaces the character or group of characters in an orderly manner with other characters or groups of characters, any The simpler version of the offering is and still is not, with secrecy from entrepreneurial opponents

 There are many varieties of cryptanalysis attacks and can be classified in many ways
 ek saamaanya vibhedan is aadhaar par kiya jaataa he ki ek hamalavar kya jaanata he or koun si kshamtaayen uplabdh hai
 In cipher text sole attack, only cipher text is available to the crypto analyzer
 main, kript vishleshak ke liye sifer text or isse sambandhit plane text uplabdh hote hai ek chaynit plane text hamale main, kript vishleshak ek plane text ko chunata he or isse sambandhit sifer text kaa adhyayan karata he, ; iskaa ek udhaaharan he dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan british ke dwaara prayukt gardening 
 Finally, in a selected cipher text attack, the cryptanalyst is able to select the cipher text and study the associated plaintext

 ek kushal sifer ke khilaaf kisi bhi hamale kii tulana main yah adhik prabhavi hota he
 For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires a known plane text and 2 55 decryptions, it attempts at about half of the possible keys to reach a point where there are better possibilities
 lekin yah paryaapt aashwaasan nahin detaa he; di i es ke khilaaf ek raikhik kript analysis ko 2 43 gyaat plane text or lagbhag 2 43 di i es gatividhiyon kii zarurat hoti he
 This is a good improvement on brute force attacks

 The most famous of these is the integer multiplication clause
 lekin asatat laghuganak kii samasyaayen bhi bahut mahatvapurn hai
 Most public keys use statistical algorithms to effectively solve cryptanalysis, these computational problems, or some of them
 
 For example, the best-known algorithms for solving the ellipsoid curve based version of discrete logarithms take much longer to solve, compared to the best-known algorithms for multiplication blocks to solve common size problems

 If the amount of time is available to a crypt analyzer and the device encrypts a number of plane text, or it detects an error in a password or PIN character, it uses a timing attack to break a cipher Can, which is resistant to analysis
 ek hamalavar mahatvapurn jaankaree praapt karne ke liye sandesh kii lambaai or praturup kaa bhi adhyayan kar saktaa he; yah treffic vishleshan kehalaata he, or yah ek chetavanee virodh ke liye bahut upyogi ho saktaa he
 Not having good administration of a crypto system, such as the use of very small keys, will weaken any system, whether it has all the other properties and of course, social engineering and other attacks that work with the crypto system, or the They handle the message, ransom, blackmail, espionage, torture xxrep 7

 Guru Dutt was a great Hindi novelist
 ve un rachanakaaron main se the jinaki kritiyaan kalathit hai
 The main reason for this is the purpose of his compositions

 The phenomenology of the novels, the naturalistic portrayal, the harsh and naked truths of the society, the reality of history, the contingencies of the events and the unique narration-style etc

 Nowadays people do not consider the nutrients of the diet in the greed of taste and we are deprived of the nutrition that we get easily, one such nutritional element is bran which is filtered and separated and thrown into the garbage
 It is given that a person who is interested in the fact that there is no obstruction of any type of stool in his body, he should give special importance to bran in his diet, because the remaining portion of the food is excluded Bran is helpful in extracting and does not allow stool to be blocked in the intestines
 Unnatural diet and irregular routines cause intestinal obstruction! This obstruction of feces is called constipation! Due to constipation, rot caused by stool in the intestines is produced due to the formation of gas, gout disorders, such as stomach cramps, diarrhea which is not clear and stomach is heavy, anek rogon ki jad, is kabj ko dur karne main 'chokar kaa prayog' vishesh sahaayak siddh hota he

 Flour Bran Required! If it is not possible at home, then outside the mill, you should grind thick flour and use it without sieving! Knead the dough and make roti after one hour, it makes the grains of bran fluffy and the bread becomes succulent, tasty, the bran softens by soaking water and going into the stomach, it upsets the stomach
 It seems obvious, if it is necessary to sieve the flour, then take the chan and separate it into the flour again after separating the garbage, aajkal kisi bhagyavan vyakti ko hi kabj ki beemaari na hogi varna har stri purush ko apach or kabj ke rogon ne gheraa he, ise log dawaao kaa seven kar kabj ko dur karte rahete he or uske aadi ho jate he ki agar daawa kaa seven na kare to pet saaf nahin hoga, na jane bazaar se videshi cholesterol, pholestrol yukt aataa, pilsbari aataa, lekin chokar yukt aataa sab baazaaroo aate kaa "pita" he, kabj ko jad se samaapt karne ke liye nimnlikhit vidhiyon ke anusaar chokar kaa seven kare ! saath main yogabhyas kaa nit abhyaas karen !

 When the sound is produced with the help of any two or more dislocations from the various organs of the mouth, only the existence of the sound is possible

 If there is a lack of conductor or convection medium after the useful role of the sound-producing components, the sensation of sound is impossible
 mana ek vyakti ek vaayu-avarodhi kaksh main baith kar dhwani karata he, to vaayu tarang kaksh se baahar nahin aa paati or baahar kaa vyakti dhwani-grahan nahin kar saktaa he

 It is called resonant sound
 jin dhvaniyon ke uccharan main vaayu keval mukh-vivar se nikle use niranunasik yaa maukhik dhwani kehete hai
 Depending on the intensity and retardation of the sound, it can be divided into three classes: sound, breathing and chanting
 jab dhwani utpaadan main swar tantriyaan ek duusare se mili hoti hai, to vaayu unhen dhakka dekar bich se baahar aati he, aisi dhwani ko naad dhwani kehete hai, yatha-g, gh, j aadi
 It is also called loud sound
 jab swar tantriyaan ek duusare se dur hoti hai to nishwaas kii vaayu bina gharshan ke saralata se baahar aati he
 Such sound is called 'breathing' or aghosha; Such as Q, T, i etc
 jab bahut mand dhwani hoti he to donon swar tantriyon ke kisi kone se vaayu baahar aati he
 Such sound is called chanting sound
 bhashaa-adhyayan main swanvigyaan kaa vishesh mahatva he kyonki anya vrihattar ikaayiyon kaa gyaan iske hi aadhaar par hoti he
 Under this, various sound producing components are studied

 It is also possible to have knowledge of changes in various contexts in pronunciation
 swanvigyaan main vibhinn dhvaniyon ke adhyayan ke saath unke utpaadan kii prakriya kaa vistrut vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 In the same study, the composition and role of various sound producing organs are also studied

 With the study of these rules, the directions of sound changes and the causes of sound changes are considered

 unhen jansadharan praaia: 'guruuji' ke hi naam se adhik jaanate hai
 He was born on Ekadashi Samvat 1963 of Falgun month accordingly on 19 February 1906 in Ramtek, Maharashtra
 ve apane mata-pita kii chauthi santan the
 His father's name was Shri Sadashiv Rao Aakhyakya 'bhau Ji' and his mother's Mrs Laxmibai Aakhyak 'tai'
 unka bachapan main naam madhav rakhaa gaya par parivaar main ve madhu ke naam se hi pukaare jate the
 Father Sadashiv Rao was initially working in the post and telegraph department, but later in 1908 he was appointed to the post of teacher in the education department
 madhu jab maatr do varsh ke the tabhi se unki shiksha prarambh ho gayi thi
 Whatever Father Pithary Bhauji taught him, he instinctively memorized it
 balak madhu main kushagra budhdi, gyaan kii laalasaa, asaamaanya samaran shakti jaise gunon kaa samucchy bachapan se hi viksit ho rahaa tha
 In 1919, he received a scholarship by showing special merit in the 'high School Entrance Examination'
 san 1922 main 16 varsh kii aayu main madhav ne metric kii pariksha chaanda ke 'jubilee hai skool' se uteern kii
 Thereafter, in 1924, he passed the intermediate examination in science subject with special qualification from 'hislap College' run by Christian Missionaries of Nagpur
 angreji vishay main unhen pratham paritoshik mila
 He used to play a lot of hockey, sometimes even played tennis
 iske atirikt vyaayaam kaa bhi unhen shauk tha
 He was very proficient in the tricks, grip and jump etc
 of Malkhamb
 vidhyaarthee jivan main hi unhone baansuri evam sitar vaadan main bhi acchhee praveenta hasil kar lee thi
 After passing the intermediate examination, a new far-reaching chapter in Madhavrao's life began in 1924 with admission to the Banaras Hindu University
 san 1926 main unhone bi
essi
 or san 1928 main em
essi
 kii parikshaayen bhi praani-shaastra vishay main pratham shrenee ke saath uteern kin
 In this way his student life was very famous
 vishvavidhyalay main bitaaye chaar varshon ke kalkhand main unhone vishay ke adhyayan ke alaava "sanskrit mahakavyon, paashchaatya darshan, shri ramakrishna paramhans, swami vivekananda kii ospurn evam prerak 'vichaar smapda', bhinn-bhinn upasna-panthon ke pramukh granthon tathaa shastreey vishyon ke anek granthon kaa asthaapurvak pathan kiya"
 Meanwhile, his interest in spiritual life was awakened
 em
essi
 kii pariksha uteern karne ke pashchaat ve praani-shaastra vishay main 'matsay jivan' par shodh kaary hetu madras ke matsyalay se jud gayi
 Within a year his father Shri Bhauji retired, due to which he was unable to send money to Shri Guruji
 isi madras-pravaas ke dauraan ve gambheer rup se biimaar pad gayi
 The doctor was of the opinion that if caution is not taken, the disease can take serious form
 do maah ke ilaaj ke baad ve rogamukt to hue parantu unka swasthya purnroopen se purvawat nahin rahaa
 During his stay in Madras, when he was working in research, once the Nizam of Hyderabad came to see the mermaid
 niyamanusaar pravesh-shulk diye bina use pravesh dene se shri guruuji ne inkaar kar diya
 Due to financial constraints Mr
 Guruji had to leave his research work incomplete and return to Nagpur in April 1929
 uname adbhut kshamta thi logo ko apni ore aakarshith karne kii
 Even after coming to Nagpur, he was not well
 iske saath hi unke parivaar kii aarthik sthiti bhi atyant kharaab ho gayi thi
 Meanwhile, he received a proposal from Banaras Hindu University to serve in the post of illustrator
 16 agast san 1931 ko shri guruuji ne banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ke praani-shaastra vibhaag main nidarshak kaa pad sambhaal liya
 As it was a temporary appointment
 is kaaran ve praaia: chintit bhi rahaa karte the
 Even in his student life, Madhav Rao used to guide his friends in their studies and now teaching had become a means of livelihood
 unke adhyaapan kaa vishay yadhyapi praani-vigyaan tha, vishvavidhyalay prashasan ne unki pratibha pahchaan kar unhen bi
e
 kii kaksha ke chaatro ko angreji or raajnneeti shaastra bhi padhaane kaa avasar diya
 As a teacher, Madhav Rao became so popular among the students with his unique talent and ability that his students started addressing him in the name of Guruji
 isi naam se ve aage chalakar jivan bhar jane gayi
 Although Madhav Rao was a Masters of Science, he was always ready to teach other subjects like English, Economics, Mathematics and Philosophy to his students and friends when needed
 yadi unhen pustkaalay main pustaken nahin milti thim, to ve unhen kharid kar or padhakar jigyaasi chaatro evam mitron kii sahaayta karte rahete the
 Much of his salary was spent on paying the fees of his promising student-friends or buying his books
 sabase pehle ""dow headgavar"" ke dwaara kaashi vishvavidhyalay bheje gaye nagpur ke swayamsevak bhaiyaji daani ke dwaara shri guruuji sangh ke sampark main aaye or us shakha ke sanghachaalak bhi bane
 In 1937, he returned to Nagpur
 nagpur main shri guruuji ke jivan main ek dam nae mode kaa armbh ho gaya
 In the context of "dr
 Hedgewar", he saw an extremely inspiring nation devoted to him
 kisi aapt vyakti ke dwaara is vishay par poochne par unhone kaha-"meraa rujhaan raashtra sanghathan kaary kii or prarambh se he
 It is my belief that i will be able to do this work with more efficacy by staying in the Union
 isliye maine sangh kaary main hi swayan ko samarpit kar diya
 i feel that my behavior is absolutely consistent with Swami Vivekananda's philosophy and methodology
 "1938 ke pashchaat sangh kaary ko hi unhone apana jivan kaary maan liya
 Constantly with Dr
 Hedgewar, he concentrated all his attention on union work
 isse dow headgavar ji kaa dhyey purna hua
 In 1939, Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar was appointed as the Sarkaryavah of the Sangh due to total dedication and strong self-restraint towards "dr
 Hedgewar", the founder of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 1940 main ""headgavar"" kaa fever badhata hi gaya or apana ant samay jaanakar unhone upasthit kaaryakartaaon ke saamne madhav ko apane paas bulaayaa or kaha ""ab aap hi sangh kaa kaary sambhaalein""
 On 21 June 1940 Hedgewar merged into Anant
 9 agast 1942 ko bina shakti ke hi congress ne angrejon ke khilaaf ""bharat chodo"" andolan ched diya
 a big movement started all over the country, but due to unorganized direction, many types of sabotage started happening on behalf of the people
 sattadhariyon ne badi krurta se daman nitiyaan apanaai
 By 2-3 months, the spark of movement subsided
 desh ke sabhi netaa karagaar main the or unki rihaai kii koi aashaa dikhaai nahin de rahi thi
 Shri Guruji had decided that the Sangh would not directly participate in the movement, but the volunteers would be motivated individually
 16 agast 1946 ko mohammad ali jinnah ne sidhi kaarywahi kaa din ghoshit kar ke hindu hatya kaa tandav machaa diya
 In those days, Shri Guruji, in each of his speeches across the country, kept on calling on the people to stand up against the partition of the country, but the Congress leaders were not in a mood to fight for Akhand Bharat
 pandit nehru ne bhi spasht shabdon main vibhaajan ko sweekaar kar liya tha or 3 june 1947 ko isaki ghoshnaa kar di gai
 The situation of the country suddenly changed
 is kathin samay main swayamsevakon ne pakistan vaale bhaag se hinduon ko surakshit bharat bhejnaa shuru kiya
 The order of the Sangh was that till the last Hindu is safe, it has to stand
 bheeshan dinon main swayamsevakon kaa athulaneey parakram, rankushalta, tyaag or balidaan kii gaatha bharat ke itihaas main svarnim aksharon se likhane laayak he
 Shri Guruji also continued to migrate to Pakistan in this difficult watch
 30 janvari 1948 ko gandhi hatya ke aarope main 4 farvari ko sangh par pratibandh lagaaya gaya
 Mr
 Guruji was arrested
 desh bhar main swayamsevako kii giraftaaryaan hui
 While in jail, he sent a detailed statement of letters and magazines, in which the government was given a befitting reply
 aahvaan kiya gaya kii sangh par aarope siddh karo yaa pratibandh hataao
 This tone was echoed across the country
 26 farvari 1948 ko desh ke pradhanmantri pandit jawaharlal nehru ko grih mantri vallabh bhai patel ne apane patr main likhaa tha ""gandhi hatya ke kand main maine swayan apana dhyaan lagaakar puri jaankaree praapt kii he
 All the criminals associated with him have been caught
 unamem ek bhi vyakti rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa nahin he
 "" 9 disambar 1948 ko satyagrah naam ke is andolan kii shuruyaat hote hi kuch 4-5 hazaar bacchon kaa yah andolan he aisa maanakar netagan ne iskaa majaak udaaya
 But in contrast, no Congress movement had such a number
 77090 swayamsevakon ne vibhinn jelon ko bhar diya
 Eventually, the ban was lifted by ordering the Union to make a written constitution, and now Gandhi's murder was not even mentioned in it
 tab sardaar vallabhbhai patel ne guruuji ko bheje huve apane sandesh main likhaa kii ""sangh par se paabandi uthaane par mujhe jitani kushi hui iskaa pramaan to us samay jo log mere nikat the ve hi bataa sakate hai


 main aapako apni shubhakamanaayen bhejtaa hoon
 "" shri guruuji ne chini akraman shuru hote hi jo maarg darshan diya uske pariprekshya main swayamsevak yuddh prayatnon main janata kaa samarthan jutaney tathaa unka manobal drudh karne main jute gaye
 The importance of their timely cooperation also had to be acknowledged by Pandit Nehru and he even sent an invitation to the RSS volunteers to participate in the Republic Day movement in 1963, despite the objections of some Congressmen
 kahana na hoga kii sangh ke teen hazaar ganaveshadhari swayamsevakon kaa ghosh kii taal par kadam milakar chalanaa us din ke kaarykram kaa ek pramukh aakarshan tha

 Its features include the ability to add web feeds and Google Gadgets
 30 april 2007 ko google ne "google personalined hompej" kaa punah namakaran karte hue "igugle" rakhaa
 As of 17 October 2007, Google made the service available as a localized version in 42 languages and by domain-name in more than 70 countries
 In February 2007, 7
1 million people used igoogle
 april 2008 main, google ke mukhaprishth kaa daura karne waalon main 20% logon ne igugle kaa istemaal kiya
 igoogle Gadgets interact with the user and use the Google Gadgets API
 google desktop ke liye kuch google gajet ko viksit kiya jaataa he jo ki igugle ke bheetar bhi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 The Google Gadget API is public and also allows anyone to develop it for any need
 saath hi google sabhi upyogkartaaon ko ek vishesh gajet ke nirmaan kii anumati detaa he jisamen gajet API ke upyog kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 The gadget is designed to be shared with friends and family
 vishesh gajet kaa nirmaan ek online vizard kaa upyog karte hue banaaya janaa chahie or nimna main se ek prakaar se sambandhit hona chahie: Some gadgets created by the developer include: 2009 main mukh prishth ke kinare igugle ne ek cidbaar ko jari kiya jisase igugle pej ke samgr swaroop main bhi badlaav aayaa
 This allows Gmail users to chat from their home page without visiting gmail
com, with the igoogle tabs at the top being held vertically instead of horizontally
 is cidbaar kii suvidha ke alaava kuch suvidhaon ne igugle ke kai upyogkartaaon ko apaset kiya, kai logon ne google forum main vartmaan main site ke dizin main badlaav nahin karne kii aavashyaktaa par apni raay di
 There is another gadget "you Might Also Like" where you see a gadget that you already have

 In April 2008, Google began offering content selection by professional artists
 8 july 2008 ko google ne igugle ke ek nae sanskaran kii pareekshan avadhi kii shuruuaat kii ghoshnaa kii jisamen kuch suvidhaon ko badla gaya he, jisamen tabs ko left nevigation ke saath badla janaa, chat kaaryakshmata ko joda janaa or aresas ke liye ek canvas-vyuu gajet shaamil hai
 Some users were selected for this test and were notified of a short description link when they logged in and provided another link to the forum
 forum par, yah spasht kiya gaya tha ki pariksha ke liye niyantran ke rup main koi opt out nahin tha
 Furthermore, there was no information on how long this trial would continue
 kai ne is nae sanskaran main opt out ke liye asamarthta par asantosh vyakt kiya
 On October 16, 2008, Google announced the release of this new version of igoogle and removed its old version
 ise jari karne ke baad lagaataar chat vijet ko shuru main shaamil nahin kiya
 Also, left navigation was not included in the location of its tabs, while changes were made for widget control
 opensotial kii taiyaari ko uddeshy bataaya gaya, jahaan nayaa canvas vyuu usamen ek mahatvapurn bhoomika main he
 informationweek reported that Vocal Group users are unhappy with this change, stating that many users did not want the forcible changes imposed on them and this is a common problem with cloud software under the control of a service provider
 mul teb leout ko phir se sthapit karne ke liye ek varkeround paaya gaya tha, jiske liye "?gl=all" ko igugle yuarel ke ant main joda gaya tha
 This workaround was removed on 4 June 2009
 kuch dinon ke bheetar hi ek or varkeround kii khoj kii gai thi
 Changing the end of the URL to "? Hl = all" will reestablish the original tab layout, where some links to the top of the home page, including "maps" and "more", will be missing
 is varkeround ko bhi 18 navambar 2009 ko hataa diya gaya
 This led to an immediate controversy again over user choice in both the UK and the world, as many people were unhappy with the new layout imposed on US users, switching them to the UK Google site where the workaround continued
 kuch ghante ke bheetar hi help forum par sabase zyada poocha jane vaala prashn tha, puraane leout ko ristor kaise karen or google utpaada vichaar prishth par suvidhaon se sambandhit kai sankhya main suzav die gaye
 Other solutions were to come forward as they may be, which require add-ons, greasmonkey scripts, or bookmarklets

 There are two types of awards - praayah ham dekhte hai ki ghurnan karne vaali vastu kaa aksh apni sthiti badalata rahata he
 In other words, the rotation-axis itself is rotating in parallel to another axis
 khagolvigyaan main, khagoleey pind ke kisi ghurniy yaa kakshiya prachal kaa dhire-dhire parivartit hona ayan kehalaata he
 For half a year, the sun remains in the north hemisphere of the sky, for half a year in the south hemisphere

 This point is not stable relative to stars; It moves slowly

 The period in which the sun returns to the same period is said to be a cyan year by walking from the spring and taking a round
 kisi taare se chalakar surya ke vahiin lautne ko nakshatra varsh kehete hai
 If the equinox had not moved, the cyan and sidereal year would have been equal
 ayan ke kaaran donon varshon main kuch minuton kaa antar padataa he
 According to modern measurements, the average sidereal year value is approximately 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, 9
6 seconds, and the average cyan year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46
054 seconds
 sayan varsh ke anusaar hi vyaavhaarik varsh rakhana chahie, anyathaa varsh kaa aarambh sadaa ek ritu main na padegaa
 The year that was still prevalent among the Hindus was a few minutes larger than the Sion year
 isliye varsh kaa aarambh aage kii ore khisakta ja rahaa tha
 For example, in the last two and a half thousand years there has been a difference of 21 or 22 days

 If we use the old Varshaman for two to four thousand years, then the months of spring monsoon will fall in that season when the winter will continue to fall

 One consequence of aion is that the celestial pole, that is, the point of the sky that is in line with the axis of the earth, moves between the stars
 vah ek chakkar lagbhag 26,000 varshon main lagaataa he
 Whenever the north celestial pole comes near a bright star, that star is called Dhruvatara in the northern hemisphere of the earth
 is samay uttar akashiya dhruv pratham laghu saptarshi ke paas he
 That is why we call this star Dhruvatara
 abhi akashiya dhruv dhruvatare ke paas ja rahaa he, isliye abhi saikadon varshon tak purvokt tara dhruvatara kahala sakegaa
 About 5,000 years ago, the first Kaliya named Tara was worthy of being called Dhruvatara
 bich main koi tara aisa nahin tha jo dhruvatara kehalaata
 15,000 years ago today, there was a star Dhruvatara named Abhijit
 hamaare gruhm sutron main vivaah ke avasar par dhruvadarshan karne kaa aadesh he
 It is clear that at that time there was some Dhruvatara

 By drawing the braid and placing it on the ground in such a way that the spindle of the braid is no longer standing, the axis of the braid keeps hovering slowly and it marks a cone
 thik isi tarah prithvi kaa aksh ek shanku parilikhit karata he jiskaa ardh sheershakon lagbhag 23 degree hota he
 The reason is that the Earth is not exactly spherical
 bumadhya par vyas adhik he
 By rough calculation we can assume that the central part is purely spherical and its exit is a ring affixed to the equator
 surya sadaa ravimaarg ke samtal main rahakar prithvi ko aakarshith karata he
 This attraction does not pass through the center of the Earth, because one segment of the pre-conceived ring is relatively close to the Sun, the other is far away
 nearesth bhaag par aakarshan adhik padataa he, duurastha par kam
 Therefore, there is a tendency for these attractions to rotate the earth and make its axis perpendicular to the surface of the sun
 yah ghurnanaj ba prithvi ke apane aksh ke parit: ghurnan ke saath sanlisht kiya jaataa he to parinami ghurnan aksh kii disha nikalati he jo prithvi ke aksh kii puraani disha se jaraa si bhinn hoti he, arthath prithvi kaa aksh apni puraani sthiti se is naveen sthiti main aa jaataa he
 In other words, the Earth's axis rotates
 aksh ke is prakaar ghoomane main chandramaa bhi sahaayta karata he
 In fact, the Moon has twice the effect of the Sun
 sookshm gananaa karne par sab baaten thik vahi nikalati hai jo bedh dwaara dekhi jaati hai
 On the puffed substance of the Earth's midline, the Sun's Assam attraction reflects the Earth's axis as a cone
 chandramaarg kaa samtal ravimaarg ke samtal se 5 degree kaa kone banaata he
 For this reason, the Moon sometimes pulls the Earth from the top of the sun, sometimes from below
 falat:, bumadhyarekha tathaa ravimaarg ke dharaatalon ke bich kaa kone bhi thod bahut badalata rahata he
 Which is called "vidolan"
 prithviaksh ke chalane se vasant or sharad vishuv donon chalate rahete hai
 The ayan mentioned above is called lunar-solar-ayan
 isamen bumadhya kaa dharaatal badalata rahata he
 But due to the attraction of the planets, the Ravimar itself is slightly disturbed
 isse bhi vishuv kii sthiti main antar padataa he
 This is called planetary aion
 alfaa pagasai, jiskaa bair naam bhi yahi he, parnin ashv taramandal ke kshetra main sthit ek tara he
 It is the 89th brightest star among the stars visible to the Earth
 isaki prithvi se dekhi gai chamak +2
49 magnitude he
 Alpha Pagasai is about 133 light years away from us
 alfaa pagasai taare ko angrezi main "marakab" bhi kehete hai, jo arabi ke "marakab" se liya gaya he, jiskaa arth " jin" he
 In traditional Indian astronomy, Alpha Pagasai and Son Pagasai are combined to give the name of the "puravabhadrapada" nakshatra, which means "the earlier happy steps"
 alfaa pagasai B9 III shrenee kaa mukhya anukram tara he, jiskaa dravyaman hamaare suraj ke dravyaman kaa lagbhag 4 guna or vyas hamaare suraj ke vyas kaa 2
8 guna he
 Its star's inherent brightness is about 160 times that of the sun
 iskaa satahi taapmaana 11,000 calvin anumaanit kiya gaya he
 Astronomers have speculated that it is nearing the end of its main sequence life and that it will begin fusion of helium at some time, leaving nuclear fusion of hydrogen
 is avasthaa main pahunchne par yah phulakar ek laal daanav tara ban jayega
 After this it will shrink and end its life as a white dwarf star

 Bharatha Katha has two characters - Bharathari and Gopichand, from whom this story begins
 raja bharthri or bhanja gopichand
 The legend of Bharathari is prevalent in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal
 chhattisgarh main bharthri kii katha kaise ai - iske sambandh main vidwaanon kaa alag alag mat he
 Nandkishore Tiwari ji says that when the Jogis of Bengal used to go to Ujjain, the story of Bharathari became popular in Chhattisgarh as well during that visit - both Bharathari and Gopichand were nath-panthi
 nath-panthi yogiyon kaa jo sampradaay hai, vah sampradaay naveen dasvin shatabdi main armbh hua
 There used to be a caste called Yogi in and around Bengal Bihar
 ye log chuaachhut nahin maanate the, jaat paat nahin maanate the
 Those people were of very advanced mindset
 ve log nath panthi yogiyon jaise the
 The Nath Panthi Yogis were cultivated in Nepal by a mixture of Buddhist and Shaiva means
 or iske baad yah sampradaay puure hindi pradesh main fail gai
 People of this community were considered illiterate because they were not educated
 par inase jo shiksha milti thi, vah bahut se shikshit log nahin de paye the
 These people used to call themselves Jogi
 log unhen nakaarte the ye kehake ki ye log shasr viheen he
 These people won the hearts of people through folk songs
 chhattisgarh main bharthri ko yogi kehete he
 Chhattisgarhi Bharathari is not a song of any caste
 jo bharthri kaa geet kaa geet gaaten he ve yogi kehalaate he
 He also calls himself a yogi in the song: shuru main bharthri ek akelaa insaan gaaya karata tha vah khanjari bajaakar gaata tha
 Later Bharathri started singing along with the instruments
 vaadyon main tabalaa, hormonium, manjira ke saath saath benjo bhi tha
 Gradually its form changed and Bharathari Yogis sing and dance together
 ye bahut swaabhaavik he ki geet ke saath nrity bhi shaamil ho gaya
 It is sung and heard with great love not only in Chhattisgarh but throughout the Hindi belt
 lok katha ek jagah se duusari jagah yatra karti he or jahaan pahunchati he vahaan ke paramparaon se prabhavit hokar vahiin kii ban jaati he
 In Bharathari of Chhattisgarh we see that "satnam" is mentioned in many places - taihar le le beti Satnamay o chhattisgarh main satnam panth prachlit he jisame satnam kaa arth he naam kii mahima
 That is why gradually the word "satnam" has also been used in Bharathari
 bharthri ke bare main bahut kinvadantiyaan hai
 Bharathari is a character who is said to have become a yogi
 bharthri ujjain kaa raja tha
 Now there are different stories about why Bharthari left the kingdom after becoming a yogi, in which everything is finally cured by Gorakhnath's grace and Bharthari becomes a disciple of Gorakhnath
 ek katha ke anusaar bharthri kii patni pingala jab kisi or purush se pyaar karne lagati he, bharthri sanyasi banakar rajya chhodkar dur chale jate hai
 And one story is quite the opposite in which Rani Pingala is very much in love with her husband
 kahani main raja bharthri ek baar shikaar khilne gaye the
 He saw there that a wife jumped into her dead husband's funeral pyre and gave up his life
 raja bharthri bahut hi aashcharya chakit ho gaye us patni kaa pyaar dekhakar
 They started wondering whether my wife also loves me so much
 apane mahal main waapas aakar raja bharthri jab ye ghatana apni patni pingala se kehete hai, pingala kahati he ki vah to yah samachar sunne se hi mar jaaegi
 She will not survive even to jump into the pyre
 raja bharthri sochate hai ki ve rani pingala kii pariksha lekar dekhenge ki ye baat sach he ki nahin
 Again Bharthari goes to hunt and sends news that King Bharthari died
 ye khabar sunate hi rani pingala mar jaati he
 King Bharthari breaks down at all, blames himself and mourns
 par gorakhnath kii krupa se rani pingala jivit ho jaati he
 And after this incident, King Bharthari goes away as a disciple of Gorakhnath
 nandakishor tiwari ji jinhone bharthri-chhattisgadhi lokgatha par gahan adhyayan kiya, or anuwaad kiya, bahut hi rochak he unka anuwaad
 Below is his translation - in which Bharatha's mother is roasting with the fire of son Kamna before the birth of Bharathari and then there is a birth account of Bharathari
