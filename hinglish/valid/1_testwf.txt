 prakritik chayan, anuvanshik aadhaar vaale lakshanon ke ek kaary ke rup main antariya prajnan ko sanderbhit karata he
 "survival of the fittest" is wrong for two important reasons
 pehla, uttarjivita, prajnan kii pehali aavashyaktaa maatr he
 Secondly, the word fitness has a special meaning in biology which is different from the meaning of the term used in popular culture today
 jansankhya anuvanshiki main, fitness yaa yogyata, antariya prajnan ko sanderbhit karata he
 "ability" does not refer to whether a person is "physically fit" - bigger, faster or stronger - or "better" according to any subjective knowledge
 It refers to the difference in fertility rate from one generation to the next
 
 The interpretation of the phrase "survival of the fittest" in the sense of "only the fittest creatures will be dominated" does not correspond to the actual theory of evolution
 prajnan kaary main kamyaabi hasil karne vaala koi bhi vyaktigat jeevadharee "feet" he or keval "shaareerik rup se swasthitam" jeevadhariyon kaa hi nahin, balki apni prajatiyon kii uttarijivita main bhi yogadan karegaa, haalanki kuch jansankhya ko anya kii tulana main paristhitiyon main behatar dhang se anukulit kiya jayega
 vikaas kii ek adhik sateek visheshta "paryaapt yogya kii uttarjivita" hogi
 "survival of the sufficiently qualified", is also influenced by the fact that while direct competition between individuals, populations, and species is seen, there is little evidence that competition is supporting the development of larger groups
 udhaaharan ke liye, ubhaychar, sarisrup or stanadhariyon ke bich; haalanki ye jaanavar khaali paristhitik awaason main badhkar viksit hue hai
 Furthermore, misinterpreting or misusing the phrase with the simple meaning "survival of organisms better equipped to survive" is rhetorical tautology
 darwin kaa matlab, badalte paryaavaran main rahane ke liye behatar anukulata hasil karne vaale jeevadhariyon ke antariya sangrakshan dwaara "tatkaal, sthaneey paryaavaran ke liye behatar dhang se anukulit hona" tha
 This concept is not a tautological concept because it includes an independent criterion of fitness
 harbart spencer ne sabase pehle is vaakyansh kaa istemaal charles darwin kii on da origin of spishiz ko padhane ke baad apni principles of biology main kiya tha jisamen unhone apane aarthik siddhanton or darwin ke jaivik siddhanton ke bich samanthaayen vyakt karte hue likhaa ki "yah swasthitam kii uttarjivita, jise maine yahaan yantric shabdon main vyakt karne kii koshish kii he, vah tathy he jise shri darwin ne 'prakritik chayan', yaa jivan ke liye sangharsh kii pakshpaati daud kaa sangrakshan bataaya he
 " on da origin of spishiz ke pehle chaar sanskarnon main, darwin ne "prakritik chayan" vaakyansh kaa istemaal kiya
 Darwin wrote in page 6 of The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, published in 1868, "in the battle of life, this preservation of variations that have gained some kind of advantage in terms of structure, formation, or tendency, i called natural selection Has given; and Mr
 Herbert Spencer has expressed the same idea quite well by the survival of the fittest
 "prakritik chayan" shabd kuch had tak bura shabd he kyonki yah sachet vikalp kaa sanket miltaa he; lekin thodaa sa parichit hone ke baad isaki avhelnaa kii jaaegi"
 darwin, alfred rasel wales se sahamat the ki yah nayaa vaakyansh - "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" - "chayan" ke duhkhadaayi maanvikaran se batch gaya, haalanki isane "prakruti ke chayan or maujiyon ke bich ke saadrishy ko kho diya"
 1869 main prakashit da origin ke paanchaven sanskaran ke adhyay 4 main, darwin phir samanaarthi shabd: "prakritik chayan, yaa swasthitam kii uttarjivita" ko pradarshit karte hai
 The term "healthiest" meant Darwin to mean "better adapted to the immediate, local environment", not the common modern meaning of "in the best physical shape"
 In the introduction, he gives full credit to Spencer, writing, "I have given this theory the natural selection name to mark its relation to the selective power of man, by which every minor variation, while useful, is preserved
" lekin harbart spencer dwaara aksar istemaal kii jane vaali abhivyakti swasthitam kii uttarjivita adhik sateek he or kabhi-kabhi samaan rup se suvidhajanak bhi he
 " da main varses da state main, spencer ne ek satyabhaasi vyakhya ko nyaaysangat siddh karne ke liye ek upalekh main vaakyansh kaa istemaal kiya ki kyon unke siddhanton ko "ugravadi prakaar ke samaajon" dwaara nahin apanaaya jayega
 vah is shabd kaa istemaal yuddhrat samaajon ke sandarbh main karte hai or unke sandarbh ke rup se yah pataa chalata he ki vah ek saamaanya siddhant lagu kar rahe hai
 "thus, by survival of the fittest, militant-type society with dedication to it in all matters whatever milakar, shaasi shakti main athaah vishwaas se chitrit hota he"
 Herbert Spencer is credited with introducing the concept of social Darwinism
 "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" vaakyansh vikaas or prakritik chayan ke anuroop yaa usase sambandhit kisi vishay ke liye ek takiya kalam ke rup main lokapriy sahitya main vyapak taur par istemaal hone laga he
 It is thus applied to the principles of unrestrained competition and is largely used by both supporters and opponents of social Darwinism
 darvinvaadee vikaas ke ek varnan ke rup main isaki khamiyaan bhi adhik spasht ho gai hai 
 Evolutionary biologists criticize the way the term is used by non-scientists and the connotations that have arisen around the term in popular culture
 yah vaakyansh prakritik chayan kii jatil prakruti kaa sandesh dene main bhi madad nahin karata he, isliye aadhuni jeevigyaani prakritik chayan shabd kaa istemaal karnaa pasand karte hai or vishesh rup se unka istemaal bhi karte hai
 In fact, in modern biology, the term fitness mostly refers to reproductive success and is unclear about the specific ways in which organisms can "fit" as in "phenotypic characteristics that enhance survival and reproduction"
 
 iske alaava, neeche "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" or naitikta kaa sammishran anubhag dekhen
 "survival of the fittest" is sometimes called tautology or repetition with a claim
 tark he ki agar koi "feet" shabd ko "uttarjivita or prajnan kii sambhaavna ko behatar banane vaale prarupi visheshtaon se sampann" ke arth main letaa he, to "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" ko bas "jivit rahane ke liye behatar tareeke se taiyaar rahane vaale jeevadhariyon kii uttarijivita" ke rup main likhaa ja saktaa he
 Furthermore, this expression becomes a tautology or repetition if one uses the most widely accepted definition of "fitness" in modern biology which is only reproductive success
 is tark kaa istemaal kabhi-kabhi daawey ke saath yah kehane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he ki darwin kaa prakritik chayan dwaara vikaas sambandhi sampoorn siddhant moulik rup se anulapic or isliye kisi bhi vyaakhyaatmak shakti se rahit he
 The expression "survival of the fittest", however, provides a very incomplete description of the mechanism of natural selection
 kaaran yah he ki yah prakritik chayan ke liye kisi mukhya aavashyaktaa, arthath anuvaanshikta kii aavashyaktaa, kaa ullekh nahin karata he
 It is true that the phrase "survival of the fittest", in and of itself, is a tautology if fitness is defined by survival and reproduction
 Natural selection is a part of diversity in reproductive success by genetic or heritable characters
 agar kuch paitruk paatr apane padaadhikariyon kii uttarjivita or prajnan ko badhaate yaa ghataate hai, to yah yantric rup se jin uttarjivita or prajnan ko behatar banane vaale paatro kaa anusaran karata he unki aavriti peedi dar peedi badhegi
 ise hi vidhivat rup main "prakritik chayan dwaara vikaas" kaha jaataa he
 On the other hand, if the characters that lead to differential reproductive success are not ancestral then there will be no meaningful development or "survival of the fittest": if the improvement in reproductive success is by instincts that are not paternal, then there is no reason Not that the frequency of these trends should increase from generation to generation
 In other words, natural selection does not simply state that "survivors survive" or that "the progenitors survive"; Rather, it states that "survivors survive, breed and therefore propagate any heritable or genetic traits that have influenced their survival and reproductive success"
 This statement or statement is not tautological: it rests on the testable hypothesis that such a fitness-dominant parental shift actually exists
 scaptic socity ke sansthaapak or scaptic magazine ke prakaashak dow maaikel shermar apane 1997 kii kitaab, whai pipal bilive viard things, main is bahes ko sambodhit karte hai jisamen vah bataate hai ki haalanki anulaap kabhi-kabhi vigyaan kaa armbh hote hai, lekin ve kabhi iskaa ant nahin hote hai or vah yah bhi bataate hai ki unki bhavishyasuchak shakti kii naitik gun dwaara prakritik chayan jaise vaigyanik siddhanton kaa pareekshan kiya ja saktaa he or unhen jhootha sabit kiya ja saktaa he
 Shermer suggests, as an example, that accurate performance of population genetics occurs when natural selection will or will not affect the change of a population
 Shermer speculates that if hominid fossils were found in the same geological strata as trilobites, this would have been evidence against natural selection
 vikaas ke aalochakon kaa kahana he ki "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" vyavhaar ke liye auchity pradaan karata he jo kamajoro ke nuksaan ke liye nyaay ke majboot samooh vaale maanakon kii aad main naitik maanakon ko nazarandaaj karata he
 However, any use of evolutionary descriptions to establish moral standards would be a naturalistic illusion, since prescriptive moral statements cannot be derived from purely descriptive premises
 chije kisi hai, iskaa varnan karne kaa yah matlab nahin he ki chizon ko usee tarah hona chahie
 yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" kaa matlab kamajoro ke saath bahut bura bartaav karnaa he, yahaan tak ki achche saamaajik aacharan ke kuch maamalon main bhi - anya logon ke saath sahyog karte hue or unke saath acha bartaav karte hue - vikasvaadi yogyata main sudhaar ho saktaa he
 
 However, this does not solve the must-have problem
 daawey ke saath yah bhi kaha gaya he ki 1880 ke dashak ke antim daur ke puunjipatiyon ne jeev vigyaan ke "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" siddhant kii vyakhya "galakat aarthik pratispardhaa ko majuri dene vaale ek naitik niyam" ke rup main kii jiske falswaroop "saamaajik darvinavaad" kaa janm hua jisane kathith taur par nirbaadh arthvyavastha, yuddh or naslwad ko gauravanvit kiya
 However, these ideas are earlier and generally against Darwin's ideas and in fact his supporters rarely prepared Darwin for support at a time when religion and Horatio generally claim the justification of Alger's mythology Were
 poonjivadi vichaardhaara ke sandarbh main shabd "saamaajik darvinavaad" kii shuruyaat 1944 main prakashit richard homestadtor kii soshal darvinism in american thot dwaara durvachan ke shabd ke rup main kii gai thi
 The use of the phrase "survival of the fittest" as a critique of Darwin's theory of evolution is an example of resulting confusion: the natural biological world using the concept of survival of the fittest as a justification for violence in human society
 In "the theory of evolution by natural selection" has no effect
 roosi araajaktaavaadi peter cropostin ne "swasthitam kii uttarjivita" kii avdhaaran ko pratispardhaa ke bajaay sahyog ke samarthan ke rup main dekha
 apni kitaab Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution main unhone jo vishleshan kiya uskaa nishkarsh yah niklaa ki swasthitam aavashyak rup se vyaktigat rup se pratispardhaa main sabase achche nahin the, lekin aksar ek saath kaam karne main sabase achche sabit hone vaale logon se bane samudaay se pratispardhaa karne main sabase achche the
 They concluded that jaanwaron kii duniya main hamane dekha he ki prajatiyon kii bahut badi sankhya samaaj main rahati he or yah bhi ki ve jivan ke sangharsh ke liye sabase achchaa sahyog praapt karte hai: samaj main aayaa, zaahir he, isaki vyapak darvinvaadee arth main - na ki astitv ke keval sadhano ke liye ek sangharsh ke rup main, balki prajatiyon kii sabhi prakritik pratikul paristhitiyon ke khilaaf ek sangharsh main
 jaanwaron kii prajatiyaan, jisame vyaktigat sangharsh ko kam karke ekadam simit kar diya gaya he or parsparik sahaayta ke abhyaas kaa sabase zyada vikaas hua he, nirapavaad rup se sabase zyada sankhya main hai, sabase zyada pragati kar rahe hai or aage kii pragati ke liye sabase zyada taiyaar hai
 By applying this concept to human society, Cropostin presented mutual aid as one of the key factors of development, the other factor being self-assertion and concluding that parsparik sahaayta ke abhyaas main, jiskaa ham vikaas ke sabase aarambhik aarmabhon ke liye phir se chitra khinch sakate hai, hamen is prakaar hamaare naitik dharanaon kii sakaaratmak or spasht mul praapt hota he; or ham dridhtaapurvak kah sakate hai ki maanav kii naitik pragati main, parsparik samarthan na ki parsparik sangharsh - kaa pramukh hissaa he

 Tulu is a popular language in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts located in the western side of Karnataka state of India and in some parts of North Kerala
 pehle tulu brahman vaidic or sanskrit sahitya likhane ke liye 'tiglri' naamak lipi ko upyog karte the
 But very little literature is found in Tulu language
 par aaj is lipi ko jaananevaale bahut kam hai
 The old Tigallari script closely resembles the Malayalam script
 ab tulu likhane ke liye kannada lipi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This Panch is one of the Dravid languages

 Hence, both these districts are collectively known as Tulunadu

 a Brahmin from Udupi district has composed a book named 'bhagavata' using the Tigari script

 According to linguists, there are four major forms or styles of tulu: shivalli - tulu brahmanon kii bolanewaali style
 Jains - The speaking style of Jains from the northern parts of Tulunadu
 saamaanya - tulunadu ke zyaadaatar logon kii bolanewaali style
 This style is used in commerce, art, entertainment
 adivasee - adivasee logon kii bolanewaali style
 According to some old Malayalam works, the area which spread from the Chandragiri River in Kasaragod to Gokarna in Uttara Kannada was known as Tulunadu
 par aaj kaa tulunadu dakshin kannada or udupi jilon tak hi simit he
 Nevertheless, many people who speak Tulu are found in Kasaragod in Kerala and Mumbai and Thana in Maharashtra

 The Assam Session General Assembly is the parent organization of all sessions
 Presently the state governments used to coordinate their activities through them
 mahasabha kii gananaa ke anusaar assam or pashchim bengal main kramshah 898 or 16 satr hai
 It is believed that the sessions originated during the preaching of the great man Srimanta Sankardev in ancient times
 Sankardev established the first season in Bardova, which was also his birthplace

 bhagwat puraana main bhi is shabd kaa istemaal anekon baar kiya gaya he
 In the Bhagavata Purana the word "session" is used to mean the assembly of devotees
 lekin assam ke nav vaishnav dharman main is shabd ne ek alag arth grahan kiya
 Mahapurusha Shankaradeva went to different provinces of Assam for preaching religion

 Devotees used to gather under the tree or in the open during Shankardev's lifetime
 shankardev ke jeevankaal ke dauraan bhakton kaa sthaayee parisar main rahane kaa chalan shuru nahin hua tha, haalanki kai jagahon par asthaayee prarthana ghar jarur banaaye gaye the
 Sankardeva first established the session in a place called Bardova or Batdrava
 is satr main ek prarthana ghar athwa namghar banaaya gaya jahaan naam kiya jaataa tha saath hi dharmik aalochanayen bhi hoti thi
 Later Madhavdev established the Barpeta session, and started the tradition of daily prayer service and religious discussions
 vaamasi gopal dev ne purvi assam main satron kii sthapana main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The Ahom kingdom in eastern Assam initially opposed the accession of religious gurus, though later, supported them to spread an asylum religion
 jald hi majuli, purvi assam main, satr parampara or adhikaar kaa ek centre ban gaya
 The religious leaders who established these sessions after Shankardev were called "than" instead of the session, although historians differ on this matter
 Some scholars believe that the space and the session are the same
