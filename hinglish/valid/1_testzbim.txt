 Dividend is the share of partners in a company's profit that it pays to its shareholders when the company makes a profit
 kisi joint stock company main labhaansh, sheyaron ke nishchit mulya ke aadhaar par miltaa he
 In this case the shareholder assumes dividend in proportion to his share
 dividend paise, share yaa anya kai roopon main diya ja saktaa he
 The portion of profit which is divided among the shareholders of a trading company is called dividend
 prayek vyapaarik company ko labhaansh vitaran karne kaa samavayi adhikaar hota he
 Operators recommend how much amount to be declared as dividend
 uske pashchaat company apni saamaanya baithak main labhaansh kii ghoshnaa karti he, kintu yah raashi sanchaalkon dwaara sifarish kii gai raashi se adhik nahin honi chahie
 In addition, the operators can also declare an interim dividend in between two general meetings, if authorized by the Articles
 yat: labhaansh company ke laabh kaa hi bhaag hota he, at: ise keval laabh se hi diya ja saktaa he, na ki poonji se
 The general rights of shareholders, such as the rate of dividend and the prerogative, etc
, are sometimes disclosed in the Seamanium concerning dividends so that those rights cannot be changed as much as possible
 kai baar inkaa prakathan antarniyamon main kiya jaat he or kabhi kabhi donon pralekhon main bhi inkaa prakathan hota he
 The manner in which the declaration and payment of dividend will be made is generally disclosed in the Articles
 jab tak company chaalu rahati he, vah puraa laabh anshadhariyon main vitaran karne ke liye baadhya nahin hoti
 Instead of distributing dividends, it can convert its profit into capital if it is arranged in the articles
 labhaansh ko isaki ghoshnaa ke din se rin mana jaataa he tathaa yah dey ho jaataa he
 Sometimes there is a provision in the Articles that it can be forfeited if the dividend is ineligible for a certain period of time after the announcement
 company se sadsy antarniyamon ke niyamanusaar labhaansh kii adhiyachana kar sakate hai kintu yah aavashyak he ki aise sadasyon kaa naam labhaansh ghoshnaa ke din company ke register main darj ho
 When the transfer of shares is on the date very close to the declaration of dividend, the transferor and the transferor can also contract who gets the dividend
 labhaansh mukhyat: teen prakaar ke hote hai: Cash dividend is paid as a check
 is prakaar arjeet aay par shairdharak ko kar adaa karnaa padataa he
 Take a simple example, if a person has 1000 shares and if his cash dividend value is Rs 1, then he will get Rs 1000 as dividend
 stock dividend main company shairdharak ko milane vaale laabh ke evaj main or share de detii he
 As an example of this dividend, the company will give five additional shares to the company holding 1000 shares, if it has a dividend profit of five percent
 property dividend main labhaansh kamaane ke rup main company shairdharak ko koi sampatti detii he, lekin company praaia: aise dividend yada-kada hi detii he
 It depends entirely on the willingness of the shareholder to keep or sell the shares received as dividend
 labhaansh ghoshit karne kii ek nishchit tithi hoti he jisaki ghoshnaa company ke nideshkagan board karte hai
 Dividend is a profitable deal for the investor as he is in a position of profit due to the guarantee of the amount invested by him as dividend
 jo stock dividend ke rup main ritern detaa he uske prati niveshak kaa bharosa zyada hota he
 The dividend paid to the investor is tax-free
 haalanki yah vyakti-vishesh ke anusaar alag-alag hota he, lekin byaaj par kar lagata he
 This is because interest is considered an expense and dividend is considered an investor benefit
 yadi company apni aay, jisamen labhaansh bhi shaamil hai, par kar adaa kar chuki he, to uske baad labhaansh par kar lene se yah dugana kar ho jayega
 For this reason, the dividend was exempted in 1997
 haal hi main kai companiyon jaise ki dabar, financiel technology, dabar or krampaton greeves aadi or piesu cell, gail, nalko ne apane shairdharakon ke liye kar mukt labhaansh kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Thus dividend is beneficial for tax avoidance
 iske kai kaaran hote hai: In private limited companies, the main shareholders get the benefit of higher dividend, as it saves them more tax
 kisi vastu ko vaid mudra main badalanaa mudrikaran kehalaata he
 Pali literature mainly contains a collection of teachings of Lord Buddha, the founder of Buddhism
 kintu iskaa koi bhaag buddha ke jeevankaal main vyavasthit yaa likhit rup dhaaran kar chukaa tha, yah kahana kathin he
 Although there are some such references in Tripitaka itself, which shows the systematic reading of some episodes of religion during the lifetime of Buddha
 udaahranarth, udaan main varnan he ki ek baar seen naamak bhikshu se swayan bhagwaan ne poocha ki tumne dharm ko kaise samajha? iske uttar main us bhikshu ne 16 ashtak virgon ko puure swar ke saath gaakar suna diya
 God also praised it
 vinayapitak aadi granthon main bahushrut, dharmadhar, vinayadhar, maatrakaadhar tathaa panchanekayik, bhaanak, suttantik jaise visheshnon kaa prayog miltaa he, jinase spasht he ki buddha ke upadeshon ke dhaaran, paaran kii parampara unke jeevankaal se hi chal padi thi
 Based on this tradition, there are three references to musicals in the Chullavagga, Deepavansh, Mahavansh etc
 texts to give the Buddha's teachings a systematic literary form
 pratham sangeeti buddhanirvana ke chaar maas pashchaat hi rajgrih main hui jinamein 500 bhikshuon ne bhaag liya, jiske karan vah panchashatika naam se bhi prasiddh he
 It was presided over by Mahakashyapa and he collected the above topics with the approval of other monks, by asking questions related to the Vinaya and Suttha with Sthya Anand from the monk Upali, the disciple of Buddha
 isi prakaar kii duusari sangeeti buddha nirvana ke 100 varsh pashchaat vaishali main hui jisamen 700 bhikshu sammilit hue or isiilie vah saptshatika ke naam se vikhyath hui
 In this, by showing many faults in the conduct of the monks of Vaishali, they were held against Vinay and presumably special arrangements were brought in Vinayapitaka
 buddhaghosh ke matanusaar to isi sangeeti dwaara buddha vachanon kaa tripitak, paanch nikaay, nau ang tathaa churaasi hajaar dharmaskandhon main vargeekaran kiya gaya
 The third musical took place in Pataliputra during the reign of Emperor Ashoka after 226 years of buddha-nirvan
 isaki adhyakshata moggaliputt tiss ne kii
 The conference lasted for nine months and finalized the discourses in it
 isi bich moggaliputt tiss ne kathavatyu kii rachana kii jisamen 18 mithyaadrushti buddha sanshdaayon kii manyataon kaa niraakaran kiya
 This composition was also included in the Abhidhammapitaka
 is sangeeti kaa ullekh chullavagg main nahin he or na tibeti yaa chini mahayan sampradaay ke sahitya main
 There is no mention of any such music in Ashoka's Bhabru article, which also mentions the names of seven episodes, or in other scriptures
 is kaaran isaki aitihaasikta main kith, vailaser aadi vidwaanon ko andeh he
 But scholars like Rezdevids, Winternitz and Gaiger have accepted its historicity
 jis sangeeti kii aitihaasikta ke vishay main pracheen ullekh evam aadhuni vidvan ekamat he, vah he vaishali kii dwitiya sangeeti
 As a result of these music and other efforts, the form of Pali Tripitaka obtained and the form which is available to us today, is as follows: mul pali sahitya teen bhaagon main vibhakt he, jinhen pitak kaha gaya he - "vinayapitak", "suttapitak" or "abhidhammpitak"
 Each of these Pitakas consists of many small and large compositions related to their respective subjects
 pali ke in teen pitakon main i
 purv chhathi shatee main hue bhagwaan buddha ke vichaaron or upadeshon kaa ek vishesh style main sankalan kiya gaya he
 There is mutual correlation between the three pitas
 vishay kaa muladhar suttapitak he jisamen bhagwaan ke upadeshon ko shrotaaon ko hridyangam karaane ke liye saral se saral, rochak kathatmak style kaa alamban liya gaya he
 Here, there is no attempt to summarize the object
 uddeshy he nai-nai baton ko saamaanya shrotaaon ke grahan yogya bananaa or isiilie yahan upadesh ke mukhya bhaag kii baar-baar punrariti kii gai he
 Incidentally, these Sutts have also depicted the religious, social and political conditions of the time, which is very important from the point of view of ancient history
 udaahranarth, digh nikaay ke samanayfal sutt, brahmajaal sutt evam mahaparinibban sutt main buddha ke samasamyik dharmpravartakon jaise mankhaligosaal, pakudhakachchayan, ajit cese kambali, sanjay baltthiputt niganthnatputt, aadi ke aachaar-vichaaron tathaa unke dwaara pravartit dharm sampradaayon kii buddha drushti se aalochana pai jaati he or saath hi un-un vishyon par buddha manyata kaa pratipaadan bhi paaya jaataa he
 The social depiction is scattered in the Sutpitaka, although its contents are available to the Jatakas under the Kudak body
 sutton main sthaan-sthaan par buddhakalin magadh, videh, koshal, kaashi aadi 16 janapadon ke raajaaon unke paraspar sambandhon evam ladaai-jhagadon or daanv-penchon ke ullekh bhare pade hai
 The Buddhist ethos in which the signs of Buddhism are found in the sermons of sutas have also been arranged in the Vinaya Pitaka, from the law-prohibition-system as the rules of virtue worthy of the monks
 isi prakaar sutton main jis tatvachintan ke beej sannihit hai, unka darshanik shabdaawalee main saidhantik rup se pratipaadan or vivechan abhidhamm pitak main kiya gaya he
 Because of this interrelatedness, Buddhism cannot have complete sangopang and systematic understanding without Tripitaka's observation
 yah pali tripitak vishay kii drushti se swayan buddha bhagwaan ke upadeshon par aadhaarit he
 From the point of view of the available text, from the third century BCE onwards, it is not proved
 buddha paramparanusaar ashok samrat ke kaal main hi unke putr mahendra swayan buddha bhikshu banakar is sahitya ko lanka le gaye or vahaan pratham shatee i
 main raja battagamani ke rajyakaal main use vah likhit rup praapt hua jisamen vah aaj hamen miltaa he
 However, we do not find any such thing which can be visited in the period of two to three centuries due to the influence of the circumstances of Lanka
 apane namaanusaar vinayapitak kaa vishay bhikshuon ke paalane yogya sadachaar ke niyam upasthit karnaa he
 It has three different divisions - Suttavibhang, Khandhak and Parivar
 suttavibhang ke pun: do upavibhag hai - mahavagg or chullavagg
 Thus, compared to these subdivisions, the Vinayapitaka is divided into five parts
 suttapitak apane vishay, vistaar tathaa rachana kii drushti se tripitak kaa sabase mahatvapurn bhaag he
 It contains a collection of Sutras which according to tradition are either stated by Lord Buddha himself or are assigned by his disciple and approved by Lord Buddha himself
 sutt kaa sanskrit roopaantar sutara kiya jaataa he
 But the formulas presented in the Sutras are not visible in the formulas that are found in the ancient formulas of Sanskrit, such as the Srauta Sutras of Vedic literature, Grihama and Dharmasutra etc
 sutara kaa vishesh lakshan he ati sankshep main kam se kam shabdon main adhik se adhik arth vyakt karnaa
 There is a complete lack of repetition in it
 kintu yahan sankshipt style ke vipareet suvistrut vyaakhyaan tathaa mukhya baton kii baar-baar punrariti kii style apanaai gai he
 For this reason the Sutra version of Sutta does not seem appropriate
 vichaar karne se anumaan hota he ki sutt kaa abhipraay mulat: sookt se rahaa he
 Each episode of the Vedas has also been called Sukta
 kisi ek baat ke pratipaadan ko sookt kahana sarvatha uchit prathit hota he
 There are five parts of suttapitaka called bodies - Dighnikaya, Majjhimnikaya, samyuktanikaya, Angusadnikaya and Khudkadnikaya
 dirghanikaay teen virgon main vibhajit he
 The first sealakhandhavagga has 13 suttas, the second Mahavagga has 10 and the third patikavagga has 11
 is prakaar dirghanikaay main 34 sutt hai
 This Sutta is longer in detail than the Sutras stored in other bodies and this is the meaning of the name of this body
 majjhimanikaay main madhyamvistaar ke 152 sutt he jo 15 virgon main vibhakt hai - Of these, there are 12 suttas in the 14th class Vibhang and ten each in the rest
 sanyuttanikaay main chote bade sabhi prakaar ke sutton kaa sangrah he or yahi is nikaay ke naam kii sarthakata he
 There are a total of 56 suttas or samyutas divided into these five classes - angutar nikaay kii apni ek visheshta he
 In this, the collection of Sutras is done according to an arrangement
 aadi main aise sutt hai jinamein buddha bhagwaan ke ek sankhyatmak padaartho vishyak upadeshon kaa sangrah he, tatpashchaat do padaarthon vishyak sutton kaa or phir teen, chaar aadi
 In the same order within this body is a compilation of eleven niches of these names Ekknipat, Dukanipat & Tik, Chatuvak, Panchak, Chhak, Sattak, Atthak, Navak, Dasak and Ekadasak
 ye nipaat pun: virgon main vibhajit hai, jinaki sankhya nipaat kram se 21, 16, 16, 26, 12, 9, 9, 9, 22 or 3 he
 Thus, the total number of classes in 11 nipatas is 169
 prayek varg ke bheetar anek sutt hai jinaki sankhya ek varg main kam se kam 7 or adhik se adhik 262 he
 Thus, the number of sutas from Angusvada Nikaya is 2308
 khuddak nikaay main vishay tathaa rachana kii drushti se praaia: sarvatha swatantra 15 rachanaaon kaa samavesh he, jinke naam hai - The third part of the Pali Tripitaka, Abhidhammapitaka, analyzes and classifies the visual thoughts of Lord Buddha and presents lists and definitions from the point of view of nature
 is pitak main nimna saat granthon kaa samavesh he- Dhamamsani is divided into two parts according to her mother
 pratham bhaag main 22 tik hai jinamein se prayek main teen teen vishyon kaa vivechan kiya gaya hai
 There are 100 shops in the second department and each shop has a law and prohibition of two subjects
 ye duk 12 virgon main vibhajit hai jinke naam hai - Thus the number of dhikamsani's tikas and dukes is 122
 inamen se pratham tik kushal, akushal tathaa avyaakrit dharmavishyak he, jo sabase mahatvapurn he or uske vishay kaa prarupan chittupapad rup nikkshep or atthuddhar in chaar candon main kiya gaya he
 The theme of Vibhang is divided into 18 departments
 kathavatthu main 23 adhyyon ke bheetar 216 prashnottar hai jinamein virdohi sampradaayon ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 There are 10 chapters in Puggalpannatti, in which, in the increasing order of one type, two type, etc
, in the tenth chapter, 10, 10 types of Pudgals, ie individuals, have been instructed
 vyaktiyon kaa vibhaajan pruthgjan, samyak sambuddha, prayek buddha, shaikshya, ashaikshya, arya, anarya aadi rup se kiya gaya he
 The basis of the composition of the metal story is different, because the first three, namely, the wing, volume and metal fractures of the same, have been discussed more closely here
 isi kaaran is granth kaa doosraa naam khamb-aaytan-dhatukatha bhi paaya jaataa he
 The relationship of these three is mentioned in the book by sitting with religions
 matikanusaar in dharmon kii sankhya 125 he jo is prakaar hai - These are interlinked in 14 chapters in the style of Q&A
 yamak main dharmon kaa sambandh vishesh vishyon ke saath paraspar vipareet rup main prashnottar style se samajhaayaa gaya he or isi yugal prashnaatmak reeti ke kaaran is rachana kaa yamak naam sarthak he
 Like are all skilled religions efficient? Are all Kushamul Kushal religions? And so on
 isi paddati se yamak main abhidhammpitak main prayukt paribhaashik shabdon kii sunishchit vyakhya dene kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 This composition is divided into these 10 punks - patthan main buddha tatvachintan ke aadharbhoot pratithya-samutpaada-siddhant kaa ek vishesh style main bade vistaarpurvak vivechan kiya gaya he
 The main four parts of the book are - in chaaron bhaagon main dhammsangani main nirdisht 22 tikon or 100 dukon kaa 24 pratyayon se sambandh nimna chah patthanon dwaara samajhaayaa gaya he : tik pan duk pan duk-tik pan tik-duk pan tik-dik pan or duk-duk pa
 With the preservation of these six articles in the previous four departments, the entire book is divided into 24 pieces
 uparyukt tripitak sahitya kaa sankalan praaia: i
pus
 teesri shatee main purna ho gaya tha, kintu pali sahitya kaa srijan iske pashchaat bhi chalata rahaa
 Although, in terms of the subject of relevant literature, it usually imitates the knowledge completely under Tripitaka, yet in its form and style, development is seen in it according to the pace of time

 a similar composition is the Petkopadesh of about this period, in which the theme of Netification is presented in some other way, in which the four Aryan truths are the mainstay which are the foundation of Buddha's teachings
 praaia: isi kaal kii teesri rachana he - milind-panhon jo pali sahitya main apni visheshta rakhti he va aitihaasik drushti se bhi badi mahatvapurn he
 It describes a conversation between the King of Sakal, Milind and the monk Nagsen
 milind us yavan naresh minadar ke naam kaa hi roopaantar mana gaya he jisane i
 pus
 dwitiya shatee ke madhya main bharat par akraman kiya tathaa punjab pradesh main apana rajya jamaaya tha

 There are seven chapters in the book - inamen se pratham teen adhyay hi granth kaa mul bhaag mana jaataa he
 The remaining four chapters appear to be added backwards
 iske anek kaaran hai- ek to tisare adhyay main granth ke pun: prarambh kii soochna he; duusare, buddhaghosh ke avataran praaia: teen hi adhyyon se liye gaye hai or tisare is granth kaa jo chini anuwaad 400 i
 ke lagbhag kiya gaya tha, usamen keval ye teen hi adhyay paae jate hai
 This composition is very interesting in style and unique in its style for the knowledge of Buddhist doctrine
 in rachanaaon ke pashchaat atthakathaon kaa yug prarambh hota he
 According to the Shrut tradition, when Maali and Sanghamitra reached Pali Tripitaka Lanka and Buddhism flourished, those original texts were written in the Sinhalese language
 ye atthakathaayen ab uplabdh nahin he
 Presumably, the reason for the creation of those books is to miss the teaching of those original books
 in nai pali atthakathaon ke karta acharya buddhaghosh kaa naam pali sahitya main bahut prasiddh he
 Among the Sinhalese chronicles he has mentioned and whose incarnations he has taken in his fables, the main ones are- antim chaar atthakathaayen nikaayon athwa unke kinhin vishyon ke vishesh vyaakhyaan ke rup main prathit hote hai
 In the absence of these original chronicles, it is difficult to say to what extent Buddhaghosha imitated them and how radically they did, however it seems clear from looking at his compositions that he has given the original choreography by his vast knowledge of Tripitaka
 Must have flourished
 unki atthakathaayen vinayapitak, suttapitak evam abhidhammpitak ke adhikansh bhaagon par milti hai, jinaki sankhya 16 he
 Apart from these eight stories, there is a specific composition of Buddhaghosha, Visuddhimagga, which can be called the enlightenment of Buddhist philosophy
 atthakathaon main swayan buddhaghosh ke kathananusaar unhone visuddhimagg main digh, majjhim, sanyutt or angutar in chaaron nikaayon kaa saar bhar diya he
 According to the dictated tradition, he had written Visuddhimagga to prove his mettle before his works
 is granth main kul 23 pariched hai
 The subject of the first two passages is "samadhi" and the remaining verses discuss "pragya"
 buddhaghosh ke pashchaat atthakathaon kii parampara ko unke praaia: samasamyik do aacharyon buddhadutt or dhammpal ne paripusht kiya
 Buddhadatta summarized Vinayapitaka's story titled Samudhapasadika, Buddhaghosha, in his post-scripture and Vinayavinchashya, and composed a prose-verse-compound text called Abhidhammavatara based on Buddhaghosa's Abhidhamma choreography
 isamen moulikta yah he ki jahaan buddhaghosh ne rup, vednadi paanch skandhon ke dwaara dharmon kaa vivechan kiya he, vahaan buddhadutt ne chittar, chetsik, rup or nirvana is chaar prakaar ke vargeekaran ko apanaaya he
 He has kept this classification in his composition named as Vibhag
 buddhadutt kii ek or rachana he madhuratth vilasini, jo buddhawans kii atthkatha he
 Dhammapala has written seven books
 khuddakanikaay ke antargat jin udaan, itishuttak, vimaanavtthu, petavatthu, thergatha, therigatha ev chariapitak naamak granthon par buddhaghosh ne atthakathaayen nahin likhin, unpar dhammpal ne paramatthdipani naamak atthkatha likhi he
 Likewise wrote the commentary called Atathasvanna on Nettikaran and the commentary called Leenatthvannana on the same, Paramatthamunjusha on Visuddhimagga, Lekanthapakasini on the fables of the four bodies of Buddhaghosha, the commentary on the Jatakattakatha and the commentary of Buddhaattatta
 in sab rachanaaon main sabase adhik prasiddh he unki visuddhimagg kii tikaa
 There is no distinction in the remaining compositions
 yadhyapi ukt tripitak va unki atthakathaon kii rachana ke pashchaat nahin he
 Although after the creation of the said Tripitaka and his stories, there is not much to be said in relation to the Buddhist text, yet the creation of the commentary literature called this Attakatha continued to be on par with the Buddhaghosha era
 inamen se kuch rachanaayen is prakaar hai : Anandkrit Abhidhamma original vaccine, Chulldmmpal integrated 'true essence', Upasen integrated Sddhmmppjotik Mahanam integrated Sdsmmppakasini, Kssp integrated Mahvichcedni and Vimtichcedni, Vjrabuddhi integrated Snmtwpasadika vaccine, well-being integrated Kemppakrn, Aniruddha integrated Abhidmmtthsngho Prmtthviniscy and Namrupprichced, Dharmsri integrated Khuddksickha and Mahaswamji integrated Mulsickha
 12veen shatee se atthakathaon par magadhi bhashaa main hi tikaaon kii rachana prarambh hui
 To facilitate this work, a musical work was done by the Sinhalese stabilizer Mahakassap during the reign of Lanka King Parakramabahu I, which resulted in eight commentaries written on the Samantapasadika etc
 stories, namely Dipani, Manjusa, Pacasini etc
 Only the written Sarathdipani vaccine is available
 iske karta sariputt kii teen anya tikaayen bhi milti hai- Sumangal, Saddhammjotipal, Dhammakirti, Budharvikhat and Meghankar - all of them have written commentaries on different fables
 inamen akele vaachissar ther ke mul sikha tikaa aadi das tikaa granth milte hai
 In the 13th century many texts like Samantakootavannana were composed by Sthavira Videha, Budhapriya and Dharmakirti
 14veen shatee kii rachanaaon main chaar kavy granth prasiddh hai- The names of the authors of the latter three compositions are unknown
 14veen shatee ke pashchaat pali-sahitya-srijan kaa kshetra lanka se uthakar brahmadesh main pahunch gaya
 The litterateurs here made Abhidhamma particularly the subject of study
 15veen shatee kii kuch rachanaayen hai- In the 16th century, Saddhammalankar wrote a commentary on the case of Patahana called Patahandeepani and wrote an epilogue called Madhusaraya Deepani on the Abhidhamma-moola-tika enjoyed by Mahanama
 17veen shatee main tripitakalankar ne atthasalini par kii bees gaathaon main visativannana, sariputtakrut vinayasangrah par vinayalankar naamak tikaa tathaa yasavadjnavatthu in teen granthon kii rachana kii
 Trilokguru composed four texts saradassi krit dhatukathayojna or mahakssap krit abhidhammatthganthipad is shatee kii anya do rachanaayen hai
 The three compositions of the Sangharaj of Brahmadesa, the ninth century of Gyanamivanshnam, are famous- 19veen shatee kii brahmadesh kii kuch rachanaayen hai- nalatadhatu vans, sandes katha simavivadvinishchay aadi
 The works of this century named Chhakeshadhatuvans, Gandhavans and Sasanavans have been introduced under Vans literature
 is shatee kii anya ullekhneey rachana he bhikshu ledisdaav krit abhidhammsangrah kii parpatthadipani tikaa tathaa yamak sambandhi pali niabandh jo unhone shrimati rice davidz kii kuch shankaaon ke samaadhaan ke liye likhaa tha
 It would not be inappropriate to mention two works of the 20th century as evidenced by the uninterrupted stream of Pali literature
 ye hai bharatvarsh main bhandat dharmanand kosambi dwaara rachit visuddhimaggadipika or abhidhammatthsangrah kii navaneet tikaa
 It can be said from the basis of this introduction that even after two and a half thousand years the policy-making section has not been separated
 lanka main jis samay tripitak par atthakathaon kii rachana kii ja rahi thi, usee samay duusari ore kuch granthkaaron main aitihaasik ruchi jaagrath hui jiske parinamswaroop dipavansh kii rachana kii gai
 The history of Lanka is described in these texts, from the earliest times to the reign of King Mahasena
 is rachana kaa upyog buddhaghosh ne apni atthakathaon main prachurtaa se kiya he or kahin-kahin uske avataran bhi die hai
 In this way, the composition of Deepavans is proved between the fourth and fifth centuries AD
 sinhal ke raajaaon ke saath-saath yahan buddha ke jivan, unke shishyon kii parampara evam teenon sangitiyon aadi kaa vivaran kuch badha chadhaakar kiya gaya he
 Presumably, the basis of its subject has been the above mentioned Sinhala story
 yah rachana pali-gadhy-mishrit he, style bahut kuch shithil he, punaruktiyaan bhi bahut he or rachana bhashaa, chand aadi ke dosha se mukt nahin he
 These characteristics are indicative of its antiquity and there is evidence that the content in it has been compiled from many sources and there was no special effort to bring editorial system in it
 kintu aitihaasik drushti se lanka main aadi se hi iskaa bada aadar rahaa he
 It is said that in the 5th century AD, Sinhala king Dhatusen taught it with national pride on the occasion of an annual festival
 bhartiya aitihaasik rachnaao main dipawans ni:sadeh ek prachinatam rachana he
 Some time after the creation of Deep Vansh, Mahanavas were created by Mahanam
 iskaa muladhar bhi ve hi sinhal kii atthakathaayen tathaa dipavansh he
 Here the rendering of the subject is more vivid and systematic than that of Deepavansh
 bhashaa bhi apekshaakrit adhik parimarjeet or style to kahin kahin mahakavyon kii paddati kaa samaran karaati he
 The original portion of the Mahavansha is of 37 passages and ends on the reign of Mahasena, similar to the Dipavansh
 prarambh ke parichchhedon main, jo lanka main bauddhadharm ke aagaman se purv desh kii dharmik paristhitiyon ke ullekh aae hai, ve aitihaasik drushti se bade mahatvapurn hai
 For example, the reign of the Pandyakamayya king is said to have lasted for 60 years before the entry of Buddhism into Lanka by Mahendra
 is raja ne 70 varsh rajya kiya tathaa rajya ke 10wein varsh main hi anuradhapur nagar kii sthapana kii
 Beyond this, additions have been made from time to time in this composition
 37wein pariched kii 50veen gaatha se aage 79wein pariched tak kii rachana sthavir dharmakirti krit he or usamen mahasen ke kaal se lekar parakrambahu pratham tak 78 raajaaon kii vanshaparampara di gai he
 This passage from the Mahavansh and beyond is called the Chulavansh
 chulvansh 80 se 90 tak ke 11 parichchhedon ke rachayita buddharakshit bhikshu ne aagaamee 23 raajaaon kaa varnan kiya jo parakrambahu chaturth tak aayaa
 10 passages from 91 to 100 were composed by Sumangal Ther and described 24 kings from Bhuvanekabhu III to the period of Kirtishree Raj Singh
 yahan lanka main isai dharm ke prachaar kii bhi soochna milti he
 The next 101st passage was composed by Sumangalacharya and Devarakshita
 tatpashchaat vahaan kaa rajya angrejon ke haath main chale jane kii bhi soochna he
 The last outgrowth of the great dynasty was published in 1936 by the monk Pragyanand Nayak and contains the history of Lanka from 1815 to 1935 AD
 is prakaar mahavansh kii rachana main chah granthkaaron kaa haath he jinke dwaara isamen bhagwaan buddha se lekar lagbhag dhai hajaar varshon kaa lanka kaa itihaas avichhinn rup se ankit kiya gaya he
 This book is also a symbol of how the Pali language was kept alive in Lanka for the said long period and the stream of literary work was never allowed to dry up in it
 dipavansh or mahavansh rachanaaon ne teevr aitihaasik vritti jaagrath kii
 As a result, many other books called the dynasty were composed
 isamen aitihaasik tathy to praaia: ukt donon granthon se hi liye gaye hai, kintu unamem jo naanaa vishyon kii shrutiparampara ko ekatra kar diya gaya he, vah mahatvapurn he
 In order to give importance to the subject, a lot of exaggerations and fantasies have also been taken shelter, due to which the historian starts to develop excitement or insolence
 is prakaar kii mukhya rachanaayen ye hai - In the above texts, for the most part, the ancient Tripitaka, their stories and the dialogue under Mahavansh is merely a repetition or elaboration
 kintu phir bhi unamem apane apane vishay kii kuch moulikta bhi he jiske aadhaar se hamen ukt vishyon kaa kuch itihaas buddhakaal se lagaakar ab tak kaa avichhinn rup main praapt hota he

 Therefore, scientists believe that in the future if humans spread to the outer solar system, then Kalisto can be an important base for them

 Ashtanga yoga, should not be understood as a path with eight distinct steps; It is an eight-dimensional passage in which the eight dimensions are practiced simultaneously
 yoga ke ye aath ang hai: 1) Yama, 2) Niyam, 3) Asana, 4) Pranayama, 5) Pratyahara, 6) Dharna 7) Meditation 8) Samadhi ashtaang yoga maharishi patanjali ke anusaar chittavriti ke nirodh kaa naam yoga he 
 Certain measures are necessary for its condition and accomplishment, which are called 'angas' and which are considered eight in number
 ashtaang yoga ke antargat pratham paanch ang 'bahirang' or shesh teen ang 'antarang' naam se prasiddh hai
 The seeker gets the right to intimate practice only when the spiritual practice is truly practiced
 'yama' or 'niyam' vastut: sheel or tapasya ke dyotak hai
 Yama means restraint which is considered to be of five types: non-violence, truth, astheya

 Pramastharya and Mana: The intermediate practice of persistence is called pratyahar
 pranayam dwaara praan ke apekshaakrit shant hone par man kaa bahirmukh bhav swabhaavat: kam ho jaataa he
 The result is that the senses move away from their external subjects and become introverted

 Now the extroverted motion of the mind becomes void and it tries to become stable by being introverted

 In abstract writing, the basic expressions of an elaborate subject or piece are written in at least words and sentences
 saar lekhan kii aavashyaktaa karyaalay, vaanijya, patrakarita, shiksha aadi kai kshetron main padati he
 Writing the essence of a material is a useful art, which has great importance in our life
 dahi ko rai se bilone par uskaa tatva bhaag upar aa jaataa he
 This separation is called butter
 yah makkhan dahi kaa saar kehalaata he
 Just as frozen curd is extracted from butter, so is the essence of any material extracted from it by the process of contemplation
 bhashaa ke sandarbh main bhi saar yahi he
 a pani baat ko prabhavi or rochak banane or use pathakon kii samaj main aa sakane yogya banane ke liye lekhak apni baat kodoharaata he, muhaavarey-lokoktiyon kaa prayog karata he, kisi katha-prasang se use pramanit karata he
 Quotes the scholarly statements and strengthens it, uses rhetorical terminology and extends the text
 kisi paath kii saamagree main bhi saar or nissar baat main antar kiya ja saktaa he
 The things that are important, we accept them and leave the rest
 aaj kaa jivan bahut bhaag-daud vaala he
 People lack time
 zamana itani tezi se aage bad rahaa he ki yadi vyakti uske saath kadam-se-kadam milakar na chale, to vah pichad jayega
 This is the reason why a person wants to know more and more things in a short time
 karyaalay main adhikariyon ke paas itnaa samay nahin hota ki ve filon or patron ko puri taur se padhein
 They want to deal with as many files and letters as possible in a short time
 vishesh rup se vah adhikari jisane haal hi main kaarybhaar sanbhaala he
 The person does not have enough time to read all the files in detail, so he orders to summarize the contents of the file concerned
 is tarah kii sthitiyon main saar bahut madadgaar siddh hota he
 By reading the summary, the officer quickly tackles a lot of files
 saar ko padhakar vyakti apni ruchi kaa samachar, lekh yaa kahani chun letaa he
 Overall, the 'abstract' is a draft prepared on the basis of the entire content, which, while being brief, covers all the main points of the content, on the basis of which the entire content can be understood
 yahan prashn uth saktaa he ki jab saar-sankshepan kaa itnaa mahatva he or saare kaam saar ke aadhaar par hi chal sakate hai, to phir mul saamagree kii kya aavashyaktaa or mahatta rahati he arthath phir mul vistrut saamagree kyon padhi jaati he? isse bhi or aage badhkar sab log saar hi kyon nahin likhte apni baaten vistaar se kyon likhte hai? In fact, the sensitivity of the story, the miracle of language, the heat of experience, cannot come in essence
 saar se kaam to chal jaataa he, kintu rachanaatmakataa kaa usamen abhaav rahata he
 Therefore, the basic material is studied to know and understand the story fully, to enjoy the miracle of language and to be detached from the creativity of the material
 vaise to hamen apni baat kam-se-kam shabdon main or sankshep main kehani chahie tathaa anargal baton se bachanaa chahie, kintu bhaavon ko puritarah se prakat karne or use prabhaavapurn style main vyakt karne ke liye saar upyogi nahin hota
 Therefore, the abstract cannot replace the original material
 kabhi-kabhi kisi tathy kii jaankaree ke liye mul saamagree padhi jaati he
 Often we churn the curd and take out the butter and use the whey for any other purpose
 thik usee prakaar jab ham kisi saamagree kaa saar praapt karnaa chaahate hai, to hamaara mastishk ek mathani kaa kaam karata he
 We read or listen to some material in the brain and our brain separates the expansion of the original material and presents it
 mulbhaav ko spasht karne or use prabhavi banane ke liye lekhak yaa vyakti anek upaay karata he jaise-bhav ko spasht karne ke liye vah And to make the emotion effective, he- apane bhav ko spasht karne ke liye vyakti uski anek tarah se vyakhya karata he
 Gives examples, so that expressions can be clear
 aavashyaktaa padane par vah bhav ko ek yaa adhik baar doharaata bhi he
 To make his sentiment effective, one uses idioms, proverbs, and uses deceptive language
 lok-prasiddh yaa sambandhit kathaon or chutkulon aadi kaa prayog karata he, prasiddh sahityakaron, raajnneetigyon aadi kii uktiyon kaa ullekh karata he or samvaad aadi kaa vyavhaar karke style ko rachanaatmak banaata he
 The following are the steps of the abstract writing process: 1
 mul saamagree kaa bodh 2
 Identification of Origin 3
 sambandhit bhaavon kii pahchaan 4
 Identification of explanations, examples and repetitions explaining the motif 5
 mulbhaav ko prabhavi banane vaale tattvon arthath kathaon, alankaaran, prasiddh kathanon or rachanaatmak tathaa vyas style kii pahchaan
 6
 Abstract writing, removing elaborate sentences to clarify the motif
 sabase pehle ham mul saamagree ko ek baar, do baar yaa zyaada baar padhakar use samajhate hai or pataa lagaate hai ki usamen kya kaha gaya he
 While reading and understanding it, we know what is the origin of the material and what are the other expressions related to it
 sarvapratham yah jaan lenaa ati aavashyak he ki kisi gadyansh ke sankshepan or saar main antar hota he
 Abbreviation is the shortened or shortened form of a given material but the abstract is even smaller than the abridged
 saar or saransh donon hi shabd ek rup main prayukt hote hai
 Often the abbreviation is one-third from the original passage
 iske liye aap sabhi shabdon ko gin kar unamem teen kaa bhaag de den or jitani sankhya aae utane hi shabdon main avataran kaa kendriya bhav apni bhashaa main likh dena chahie
 Reducing words is also an art, keeping the original sentiment alive
 isaki do vidhiyaan hai : 1
 Disclaimer method 2
 parivartan vidhi Under this, the words have to be dropped, ie the words which are not useful, even after removing them, there is no change in the meaning, it is called renunciation method
 isamen lekhak kaa parichay, pataa aadi nahin likhaa jaataa
 If something is explained by giving examples etc
 they are left out
 keval mul sandesh hi liya jaataa he
 Use of proverbs, ornaments etc
 are also discarded
 vaakyon ko sankuchit karke likhaa jaataa he
 One word is used for many words
 bhashaa main chusti or kasaav apekshit he, jisase sankshepan saral, swaabhaavik, sundar or prabhavi lage
 It is necessary to keep these things in mind while writing letters, comments, reports etc
 in the office
 is vidhi main mul avataran kii bhashaa ko jyon-kaa-tyon na utaar kar kuch parivartan karnaa apekshit he, jaise-sandhi or samaas kaa prayog karke shabdon ko kam kiya ja saktaa he

 isi prakaar kai shabdon ke liye ek shabd kaa prayog kar vaakyon ko chota kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, 'one who does not believe in God' can be tried by saying the word 'atheist' or the one who is on trial is called 'accused'

 Extreme care is required in summarizing letters, comments and reports
 pehle patr yaa tippan ko dhyaan se padhanaa chahie
 If the matter is not clear from reading once, then it should be read twice or thrice, because if the things given in the letter are not understood properly, then there can be mistake in the abstract
 patron main sarkari niyamon, adeshon yaa purv-patron kaa ullekh rahata he, isliye yah zaruri he ki unka saar banane se pehle us saamagree ko thik se dekh liya jaae, tabhi saar thik or upyogi ban saktaa he
 The file has two parts - the correspondence section and the comment section
 patrachaar bhaag main maamle se sambandhit patr rakhe jate hai or tippan bhaag main maamle se sambandhit tippaniyan hoti hai
 These comments are written in such a way that they contain a summary of pre-comments which can be written without further reading

 If there is a small omission in the note writing, then the entire course of action can be changed
 saar-lekhan ke samay dhyaan rakhane yogya baaten: 1
 Understanding the original content by reading one, two or more times
 2
 saamagree main ai vyakhyaaon, udaahranon or bhaavon ke doharaav ko rekhaankit karnaa
 3
 Writing the motif on separate paper
 4
 mulbhaav or usase sambandhit bhaavon ke aadhaar par vivarnaatmak anya purush style main mul saamagree se lagbhag ek-tihaai aakaar main saar-sankshepan likhnaa
 5
 If necessary, write the title of the abstract on the basis of the motif
 6
 likhit saar ko padhanaa or dekhnaa ki kahin usamen koi mukhya baat aane se rah to nahin gai he
 7
 Editing abstract when necessary
 sampadan kaa arth he ki saar main koi mukhya baat aane se rah gai ho to use jodna
 If there is any repetition in it, then remove it and make the language style appropriate and agile
 nishchit anuchhed kaa sheershak chhaantna bhi ek kala he
 The title should always be based on the content and attached to its central sense
 saar-sankshepan likhane se pehle hi yadi sheershak spasht ho jaae to vichaaron ko saar rup main kagaz par utaarne main bahut suvidha rahati he
 Choosing the title is not something like tit-for-tat work but should be used with tact
 yah ek prakaar kaa kaushal he jise nirantar abhyaas karke viksit kiya ja saktaa he
 There is a saying that "kadmati Hot Sujan" is a practice practiced in art
 sheershak chunane ke liye aap avataran ko do-teen baar pard jaaie or iske kendriya bhav par vichaar kiijie
 Sometimes this central feeling is found at the beginning of the descent
 parantu iskaa koi kadaa niyam nahin he
 Sometimes it can occur in the middle or end of a passage
 sheershak sadaiv aakarshak or ruchikar hona chahie saath hi upyukt bhi ho jisamen sampurna saamagree kaa tathy athwa aashay spasht hota ho
 Once, after reading the title, the reader guesses what will happen in the article and at the same time there is so much attraction in the title that it will make the reader compelled to read the content
 ek hi anuchhed ke ek athwa kai sheershak bhi ho sakate hai
 Usually the title is a word or a phrase
 sheershak dene ke liye adhiktar samaas-paddati kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes a gnome or sentence can also be a suitable title
 anuchhed samaj kar kai baar pard lene ke baad jo zyaada aapke man ko janche vahi upyukt sheershak hota he
 The same should be accepted
 kisi saar kaa sheershak upyukt paakar hi pareekshak saar padhane kii aavashyaktaa kaa anubhav karata he
 Therefore, the title should be chosen very thoughtfully

 In such a difficult time, Baba Ramdev Pir left Mecca on the day of Bhado Shukla Paksha Dooj in the house of Tanwar dynasty Rajput and Ajmal ji ruler of Ranicha, near the famous city of Pokaran in western Rajasthan, and left Mecca on 140th day
 There is a pledge that they eat those food in those shells, then Baba Ramdev said to them humbly that he also has a vow that the guest who came home should not be served without food
 TE as well as Baba showed supernatural miracle was that CP which PIR he had laid before him
 is chamatkaar se ve pir itane prabhavit hue ki unhone baba ko piron kaa pir sweekaar kiya
 After all, Baba Ramdev, who taught unity to everyone with service to the people, did Bhadrapad Shukla Ekadashi VS
 Took the living tomb in 1442
 shri baba ramdev ji kii samadhi sanwat 1442 ko ramdev ji ne apane haath se shriphal lekar sab bade budhon ko pranaam kiya tathaa sabane patr pushp chadhaakar ramdev ji kaa hardik tan man va shraddha se antim pujan kiya
 Ramdev Ji stood in the tomb and gave his last sermon to everyone and said, 'puja recitation to the Shukla Paksha of the month, worshiping hymns and celebrating the festival, awakening the night
 prativarsh mere janmotsav ke upalaksh main tathaa antardhyaan samadhi hone kii smriti main mere samadhi str par mela lagegaa
 Do not keep confusion and discrimination in my Samadhi Pujan
 main sadaiv apane bhakton ke saath rahoonga
 Thus Shri Ramdev Ji Maharaj took samadhi
 ' aaj bhi baba ramdev ke bhakt dur- dur se runicha unke darshanath or aradhana karne aate he
 They remove the sorrows of their devotees, fulfill their wishes
 har saal lagane meley main to lakhon kii taadaat main juty unke bhakton kii bheed se unki mahatta va unke prati jan samudaay kii shraddha kaa akalan aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he
 King Ajmal ji, despite being a devotee of Dwarkanath, was sad that he had no son to light the tanwar clan and was an infertile
 doosraa du:kha tha ki unke hi rajya main padane vaale pokaran se 3 mile uttar disha main bhairav rakshas ne pareshaan kar rakhaa tha
 For this reason Raja Rani was always depressed
 shri ramdev ji kaa janm bhadva sudi pancham ko vikram sanwat 1409 ko barmer jile kii shiv tehsil ke undu kashmir gaanv main somvaar ke din hua jiskaa pramaan shri ramdev ji ke shrimukh se kahe gayi pramaanon main he jisamen likhaa he samvat chaturdash saal navam chait sudi pancham aap shri mukh gaayi bhane raja ramdev chait sudi pancham ko ajmal ke ghar main aayon jo ki tuvanr vansh kii bahi bhaat par raja ajmal dwaara khud apane hatho se likhvaya gaya tha jo ki pramanit he or gokuldaas dwaara krit shri ramdev choubees pramaan main bhi pramanit he aman ghatoda The child is the happiness of the parents' life
 raja ajmal ji putr prapti ke liye daan punya karte, sadhu santon ko bhojan karaate, yajna karaate, nity hi dwarkanath kii puja karte the
 In this way, King Ajmal Ji reached Dwarka thinking of a way to kill the Bhairav demon
 jahaan ajmal ji ko bhagwaan ke saakshaat darshan hue, raja ke aakhon main aansu dekhakar bhagwaan main apane pitambar se aansu ponkar kaha, he bhaktaraj ro mat main tumhaara sara du:kha jaanata hoon
 i am very happy to see your devotion, ask what you want, i will fulfill all your wishes
 bhagwaan kii aseem krupa se prasann hokar bole he prabhu agar aap meri bhakthi se prasann hai to mujhe aapke samaan putr chaiye yane aapako mere ghar putr banakar aana padegaa or rakshas ko markar dharm kii sthapana kerani padegi
 Then Lord Dwarkanath said- o devotee! Go, i promise you that first your son will be Viram Dev, then Ajmal ji said, o God, what is small and what is great for a son, God said - second i will come to your house myself
 ajmal ji bole he prabhu aap mere ghar aaoge to hamen kya maaloom padegaa ki bhagwaan mere dhar padhaare hai, to dwarkanath ne kaha ki jis raat main ghar par aaunga us raat aapke rajya ke jitne bhi mandir he usamen apane aap ghantiyaan bajane lag jaayegi, mahal main jo bhi pani hoga vah doodh main badal jayega tathaa mukhya dwaar se janm sthaan tak kumkum ke pair najar aayenge vah meri akashwani bhi sunai degi or main avatar ke naam se prasiddh ho jaaungaa
 Shri Ramdev ji was born in the year 1409 to the King of Bhadrapad in the house of King Ajmal ji
 us samay sabhi mandiron main ghantiyaan bajane lageen, tej prakaash se sara nagar jagamagane laga
 All the water in the palace turned into milk, from the main gate of the palace to the cradle, the footsteps of Kumkum became footprints, the number kept in the palace temple rang automatically
 usee samay raja ajmal ji ko bhagwaan dwarkanath ke diye hue vachan yaad aaye or ek baar pun: dwarkanath kii jai boli
 Thus Dwarkanath incarnated the house of King Ajmal ji
 bal lila main mata ko parchaa God started his child Leela after taking birth
 ek din bhagwaan ramdev va viramdev apni mata kii god main khel rahe the, mata manade un donon baalkon kaa rup nihaar raheen thim
 The beautiful scene in the morning was adding more beauty
 udhar daasi gaay kaa doodh nikaal kar laayi tathaa mata manade ke haathon main bartan dete hue inhen baalkon ke krida kriya main ram gai
 The mother goes to the milk to offer milk to the stove
 mata jyon hi doodh ko bartan main daalkar chuulhe par chadhaati he
 On the other hand, Ramdev jokes a kiss on the cheek of Viramdev ji to show his mother a miracle
 jisase ramdev ji gir jate hai or rone lagate hai
 Hearing the cry of Ramdev ji, Mata Maenade leaves the milk on the stove and comes and sits down in the lap of Ramdev ji
 udhar doodh garm hon ke kaaran girane lagata he, mata manade jyanhi doodh girtaa dekhati he vah ramdevji ko godi se neeche utaarna chaahati he utane main hi ramdevji apana haath doodh kii ore karke apni dev shakti se us bartan ko chuulhe se neeche dhar dete hai
 Seeing this miracle, Mata Maenade and Ajmal ji and maid sitting there all hail Dwarkanath
 ek baar balak ramdev ne khilone vaale ghode kii jid karne par raja ajmal use khilone vaale ke pas lekar gayi evam khilone banane ko kaha
 King Ajmal asked to make sandalwood and velvet cloth horse
 yah sab dekhakar khilone vaala laalach main aa gaya or usne bahut sara kapada apni patni ke liye rakh liya or us main se kuch hi kapada kaam main liya
 When the boy Ramdev sat on the horse, the horse took him and went into the sky
 raja khilone vaale par gussa hue tathaa use jail main daalane ke aadesh de diye
 After some time, the boy Ramdev came back with the horse
 khilone vaale ne apni galati sweekaari tathaa bachane ke liye ramdev se guhaar kii
 Baba Ramdev forgave him by showing kindness
 abhi bhi, kapadey vaala ghoda baba ramdev kii khaas chadhaava mana jaataa he
 In Samvat 1425, Ramdev Ji Maharaj established a village, named Runicha, 12 km north of Pokaran
 log aakar runicha main basane lage
 Runicha village became very beautiful and delightful
 bhagwaan ramdev ji atithiyon kii seva main hi apana dharm samajhate the
 He always kept the blind, the lame, the lame, the lepers and the afflicted with heart
 ek samay ramdev ji ne darbar baithaaya or nijeeya dharm kaa jhandaa gaadkar unch neech, chuaa chhot ko jad se ukhadkar fankne kaa sankalp kiya tab usee darbar main ek seth bohitaraaj vahaan baitha darbar main prabhu ke gungan gaata tab bhagwaan ramdev ji apane paas bulaayaa or he seth tum pradesh jaao or maaya lekar aao
 On hearing the words of Prabhu, Bohitaraja started to panic, then Lord Ramdev said, “devotees, whenever there is a crisis on you, then i will help you in every crisis
 tab seth runicha se ravaanaa hue or pradesh pahunche or prabhu kii krupa se bahut dhan kamaaya
 In a year, Seth became the hero's biggest jeweler
 kuch samay baad seth ko apane bacchon kii yaad aayi or vah apane gaanv runicha aane kii taiyaari karne laga
 Sethji thought if i would go to Ranicha, Ramdevji would ask what brought me from the state, then Seth ji bought diamond necklace for Prabhu and ordered the servants to fill all the diamond emerald jewels in the boat, i will go to my country and Seth Sara Left with luggage
 seth ji ne sochaa ki yah haar bada keemtee he bhagwaan ramdev ji is haar kaa kya karenge, uske man main laalach aayaa or vichaar karne laga ki runicha ek chota gaanv he vahaan rahakar kya karuunga, kisi bade shahar main rahungaa or ek bada sa mahal banaaunga
 At the same time, there was a storm in the sea, the boat driver said that Seth ji storm is very terrible, the curtain of the boat has also burst
 ab naav chal nahin sakati naav to duubegi hi
 For what purpose will this Maya die for you? seth bohitaraaj bhi dhiraj kho baitha
 Many Goddesses started remembering the Gods but all was useless, none of the gods helped her, then Sethji came to notice of Shri Ramdev ji's word and started calling Seth Prabhu with a compassionate voice
 he bhagwaan mujhase koi galati huyi ho jo mujhe maaf kar dijiye
 In this way Sethji was calling Lord Shri Ramdev Ji in the river
 udhar bhagwaan shri ramdev ji runicha main apane bhai viramdev ji ke saath baithe the or unhone bohitaraaj kii pukaar suni
 Lord Ramdev ji took his arm and Bohitraj Seth took the boat that was sinking
 yah kaam itani shighrata se hua ki paas main baithe bhai viramdev ko bhi pataa tak nahin padane diya
 Ramdev ji's hands were drenched with sea water
 bohitaraaj seth ne sochaa ki naav achaanak kinare kaise lag gai
 Seth's happiness was not limited by escaping such a terrible storm
 mallaah bhi soch main pad gaya ki naav itani jaldi tufaan se kaise nikal gai, ye sab kisi devtaa kii krupa se hua he
 Seth Bohitraj said that no child can be deprived of the one who is guarded by Lord Shri Ramdev ji
 tab mallahon ne bhi shri ramdev ji ko apana isht dev mana
 On reaching the village, Seth told the whole thing to the villagers
 seth darbar main jaakar shri ramdev ji se mila or kehane laga ki main maaya dekhakar aapako bhul gaya tha mere man main laalach aa gaya tha
 Forgive me and order where i spend this illusion
 tab shri ramdev ji ne kaha ki tum runicha main ek baavdi khudva do or us baavdi kaa pani meetha hoga tathaa log ise parchaa baavdi ke naam se pukaarenge va iskaa jal ganga ke samaan pavitra hoga
 In this way, even today this pancha bawdi is built in Ramdevra
 chamatkaar hone se log gaanv-gaanv se runicha aane lage
 The clerics and the pirs also came to know about this
 bhagwaan shri ramdev ji ghar ghar jate or logon ko upadesh dete ki unch-neech, jaat-paat kuch nahin he, har jati ko baraabar adhikaar milanaa chaiye
 The Pirs thought to test Shri Ramdev ji that the elder Pir who lived in Mecca informed them that a great Pir has been born among the Hindus who lives a dead creature, eyes the blind, guests
 Doing service is considered their religion, they should be tested
 yah khabar jab makka pahaunchi to paanch pir makka se ravaanaa hue
 In a few days he reached Pir Runicha
 paanchon piron ne bhagwaan ramdev ji se poocha ki he bhai runicha yahaan se kitni dur he, tab bhagwaan ramdevji ne kaha ki yah jo gaanv saamne dikhaai de rahaa he vahi runicha he, kya main aapke runicha aane kaa kaaran puch saktaa hoon ? tab un paanchon main se ek pir bole hamen yahaan ramdev ji se milanaa he
 Then the Lord said, o Pirji, i am Ramdev, i am standing in front of you, tell me what service is worthy of me
 shri ramdev ji ke vachan sunakar paanchon pir prabhu ke saath ho liye
 Ramdevji did great service to the five peers
 prabhu paanchon piron ko lekar mahal padhaare, vahaan par gaddi, takiya or jajam bichaai gai or piraji gaddi takiyon par viraaje magar shri ramdev ji jajam par baith gaye or bole he piraji aap hamaare mehmaan hai, hamaare ghar padhaare hai aap hamaare yahaan bhojan karke hi padharna
 Hearing this, the peers said, "O Ramdev, the food-eating bowls we have forgotten in Mecca
" ham usee katore main hi bhojan karte hai doosraa bartan varjit he
 If you want to eat food, then we can get the same bowl which we have forgotten in Mecca and then we can have food, otherwise we will not eat
 tab ramdev ji ne kaha ki he pir ji agar aisa he to main aapke katore manga detaa hoon
 Saying this, Lord Ramdev ji lengthened his hand and in an instant put five bowls in front of the Pirs and said, Pir ji, now recognize this bowl and have food
 jab piron ne paanchon katore makka vaale dekhe to paanchon piron ko shri ramdev ji mahanata par vishwaas hua or unke vichaaron or aacharan se bahut prabhavit hue or kehane lage ham pir hai magar aap mahaan pir hai
 From today you will know the world as Ramapir
 is tarah se piron ne bhojan kiya or shri ramdevji ko pir kii padavi mili or ramsapir, ramapir kehalaae
 In 1425, Baba Ramdev got engaged in service to his parents and here, one day Ramdev ji's mother Maanade started telling her husband Raja Ajmal ji that his prince has grown up, so get engaged to him so that we too can see daughter-in-law
 Can
 jab baba ramdev ji ne janm liya tha us samay rukmani ko vachan dekar aaye the ki main tere saath vivaah rachaaunga
 In the year 1426, Shri Ramdev was married to Naitlade, daughter of Thakur Dalji Sodha of Amar Kot
 manyata he ki bhadrapada shukla dashami ko baba ramdev ne jivit samadhi lee thi
 On Samvat 1442, Ramdev, with his hand, paid obeisance to all the elders, and after offering a letter to everyone, he worshiped Ramdev to the last with heart, heart and reverence
 ramdev ji ne samadhi main khadey hokar sab ke prati apane antim upadesh dete hue kaha ki prati maah kii shukla paksh kii dooj ko puja paath, bhajan kirthan karke parvotsav manaanaa, raatri jaagran karnaa
 Every year on the occasion of my birth anniversary and in memory of the inner Samadhi, a fair will be held at my Samadhi level
 mere samadhi pujan main bhranti va bhed bhav mat rakhana
 i will always be with my devotees
 is prakaar shri ramdev ji maharaj ne samadhi lee
