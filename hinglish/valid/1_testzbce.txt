 Which means - Truth
 Pravda was the head of Russia [newspaper] from 1912 to 1991, which was reintroduced by Lenin-led Bolshevik Russian Communist Party
 Pravda's republication began on 22 April 1912 in St
 Petersburg, Russia
 Pravda was originally started by the Spilka Party of Ukraine in 1905
 Leon Trotsky was later assigned the editorship of this newspaper
 To avoid censorship, it was published outside Russia and secretly brought to Russia
 This newspaper played an important role in the coup of Tsar Nicholas II in the Russian Revolution and then Communist Mensevico
 Many of Lenin's most important writings were initially published in Pravda and later published as booklets
 On 22 August 1991, after the fall of the Russian Communist Party, then President Boris Yeltsin closed Pravda and Seized all the assets of the newspaper
 Pravda's publication resumed in Lithuania in 2004, but now its form is very different from the original newspaper

 International relations is the study of relations between different countries, as well as the role of sovereign states, inter-governmental organizations, international ngos, non-governmental organizations and multinationals
 anterrashtriya sambandh ko kabhi-kabhi 'antararashtriya adhyayan' ) ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, haalanki donon shabd puri tarah se paryaay nahin hai
 In simple terms, 'international politics' means 'doing politics among states'
 yadi 'raajnneeti' ke arth kaa adhyayan karen to teen pramukh tatv saamne aate hai - samoohon kaa astitv; samoohon ke bich sahmati; tathaa samoohon dwaara apane hiton kii purti
 If we assess this effect internationally, then these three elements are mainly - the existence of states; Conflict between states; And the use of power to fulfill their national interests
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti un kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karnaa he jiske antargat rajya apane raashtra hiton kii purti hetu shakti ke aadhaar par sangharshrat rahete hai
 In this context, national interests are the main goals of international politics; Conflict sets its direction; And Shakti is considered as the main means of achieving this objective
 parantu uparyukt paribhaasha ko ham paramparaagat maan sakate hai, kyonki aaj ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ kaa sthaan isse vyapak avadharana ‘antarrashtriya sambandhon’ ne le liya he
 Under this, along with mutual conflict of states, the collaborative aspects are now studied under international politics
 iske atirikt aaj ‘rajyon’ ke alaava anya kai kaarak bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vishay kshetra ban gaye hai
 Therefore, under this, individuals, institutions, organizations and many other non-state units have also joined
 iskaa vartmaan aadhaar va vishay kshetra aaj kaaphi vyapak swaroop le chukaa he
 Before discussing all these topics, it becomes very essential to review the following definitions given by different scholars- in paribhaashaon kaa dayera ati simit he, kyonki iske antargat multah ‘rajyon’ ko hi anterrashtriya raajnneeti ke kaarak ke rup main mana gaya he
 It is limited to the nature of international politics
 mukhya rup se hence je
 margenthau, herald spraoot, bone doyak, thampsan aadi iske mukhya samarthak hai jo inaki nimna paribhaashaon se spasht ho jaataa he- International definitions discuss the broad nature of international politics, international relations
 isamen rajya ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke naveen karkon jaise antarrashtriya sanghathan, deshaantar samooh, gaiyr sarkari sanghathan, antarrashtriya santhaayen, kuch vyaktiyon aadi ko bhi sammilit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, along with the struggle, cooperation and politics, as well as directly or indirectly affecting it, ie, cultural, religious, social, science and technical aspects are also mentioned
 vibhinn lekhakon kii nimnlikhit paribhaashaon se yah aashay ati spasht rup main ujagar ho jaataa he- In this way the nature of international politics becomes very broad from the beginning to the present
 isamen aaj raashtra rajyon ke saath vibhinn vishwa ikaayiyon evam sanghathanon ke adhyayan kaa samavesh ho chukaa he
 But even after all these changes, the focal point of these studies is still a nation state
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ke bare main nimna nishkarsh saamne aate hai
 Therefore, the nature of international politics is variable
 jab-jab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke parivesh, karkon va ghatnakram main parivartan aayegaa, iske adhyayan karne ke tareekon va drushtikonon main bhi parivartan anivaary he
 Additionally, this change is continuous rather than permanent
 iske saath-saath vibhinn karkon, staron, ayaamon aadi ke kaaran yah bahut jatil he atah iske sucharu adhyayan hetu bahut spasht, tarksangat, vyapak drushtikon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As is known from the above definitions and form, the subject area of international politics is increasing
 aaj iskaa vishay kshetra kaaphi vyapak ho gaya he jiske antargat nimnlikhit baton kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he- Therefore, today the subject area of international politics is very broad and complex and is moving towards development
 iske antargat vibhinn paramparaagat karkon ke saath-saath gaiyr-paramparaagat karkon kaa adhyayan bhi mahatvapurn hota ja rahaa he
 The history of the development of international politics is not very ancient, rather the subject is a product of the twentieth century

 isi samay anya vishvavidhyalayon evam sansthaanon main bhi isi prakaar kii vyavasthaaen dekhne ko mili
 Therefore, if we look at the history of this subject in the last one century, then along with the ups and downs in this subject, information about its establishment in an autonomous subject is available
 is vishay main aaye bahuaiami parivartanon ne jahaan ek ore vishaywastu kaa sanvardhan, samanvay tathaa vikaas kiya he, vahiin duusari ore vibhinn siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karke bahut si jatil samasyaon evam pahaluon ko samajhane main sahaayta pradaan kii he
 Kenneth Thompson in his 1962 review, Review of Politics, has divided the history of international politics into four parts, on the basis of which a clear and sure study of this subject can be possible
 vikaas ke in chaar charnon main shityudhottar yug ke paanchaven charan ko bhi sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 Their detailed description is as follows: pratham vishwayuddh se purv itihaas, kanoon, raajnneeti shaastra, darshan shaastra aadi ke vidwaan hi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke alag-alag pahaluon par vichaar karte the
 It was mainly historians who studied it as diplomatic history and the history of relations with other countries
 iske antargat kootneetigyon va videsh mantriyon dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon kaa lekha jokha hota tha
 Hence, it is also known as diplomatic history
 i
ech
car ke anusaar pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh kaa sambandh keval sainikon tak samajha jaataa tha tathaa iske samakaksh antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa sambandh rajanyikon tak
 In addition, even in democratic countries, foreign policy was traditionally kept separate from party politics and the elected members also felt unable to control the foreign ministry
 1919 se purv is vishay ke prati udaseenta ke kai pramukh kaaran the - pratham, is samay tak yahi samajha jaataa tha ki yuddh va rajyon main gathbandhan usee prakaar swaabhaavik he jaise garibi va berogari
 Therefore, preventing war, foreign policy and mutual relations between states was considered out of the control of human power
 dwitiya, pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh itane bhayankar nahin hote the
 Third, in the absence of means of communication, international politics was limited to a few states
 is prakaar is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan kii sabase badi kami saamaanya hiton kaa vikaas rahaa
 In this period, only a descriptive study of diplomatic history was done
 parinamswaroop, isse na to vartmaan tathaa na hi bhavi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane main koi madad mili
 The quantum achievement of this era was the establishment of the Chair of the Study of International Politics at the University of Wales in 1919
 do vishwa yudhon ke bich ke kaal main do samaanaantar dhaaraon kaa vikaas hua
 The first of which emphasized the study of current events / problems, except for the dominance of earlier historicity
 iske saath saath ab aitihaasik raajnneetik adhyayan ko vartmaan raajnneetik sandarbhon ke saath jod kar dekhne kaa prayaas bhi kiya gaya
 Despite the diminishing of historical influence, there still remains a lack of a holistic approach to the study of international politics
 is kaal main vartmaan ke adhyayan par to bahut bal diya gaya, lekin vartmaan evam ateet ke parsparik sambandh ke mahatv ko abhi bhi pahachaanaa nahin gaya
 In addition, neither was there an attempt to see post-war political problems with comparable problems of the past
 shaayad isiilie is yug main bhi do moolbhoot kamiyaan spasht rup se ujagar raheen
 First, like the first phase, universal principles could not develop in international politics even in this period
 dwitiya, aaj bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa adhyayan adhik suspasht evam tarksangat nahin ban paaya
 Thus, in this phase, there was not much change in the study of international politics except the change in the status of force, nor was the confirmation of this subject becoming an explicitly independent discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa tritiy charan bhi dwitiya charan ke samaanaantar do vishwa yudhon ke bich kaa kaal rahaa
 It is called the era of reformism because it envisaged reform of international politics through the establishment of the League of Nations by the states
 is yug main mukhya rup se sansthagat vikaas kiya gaya
 The scholars, diplomats, politicians and thinkers of this period believed that if international institutions are developed, then the problems of war and peace present in front of the world community will be possible
 is uddeshy hetu kuch kanoonee va naitik upagamon kii sanrachanaayen kii gai jinke nimna mukhya aadhaar the
 International organization was envisaged with emphasis on these ideals and moral values
 isaki sthapana ke uparant yah mana gaya ki ab antarrashtriya sambandhon main rajyon ke madhya shaanti banane kaa sangharsh samaapt ho gaya
 There will be no place of balance of power under the new system
 ab rajya apane vivaadon kaa nipataara sangh ke madhyam se karenge
 Therefore, in this era not only the problems of war and peace were discussed, but its far-reaching reforms were also thought of
 atah adhyayankartaaon ke mukhya bindu bhi kanoonee samasyaon va sanghathanon ke vikaas ke saath-saath inke madhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ko badalane vaala rahaa
 Finally, in this period more emphasis has been laid on emotional, imaginative and moral reformism
 parantu vishwayudhon ke bich in upagamon kii sarthakata par hameshaa prashn chihn laga rahaa
 While the first decade of United Nations activities showed a ray of hope, the economic situation of the second decade completely ended this notion
 badi shaktiyon ke madhya asahyog va gutbandiyon ne shaanti kii sthapana kii bajaay shakti sangharsh vyavastha ko janm diya
 While Japan invaded Manchuria and disrupted peace, Italy, Germany and Russia not only relinquished membership of the League in controversial situations, but also intensified the process of the start of World War II

 The fundamental changes in international politics at this stage not only broadened its content but also led to many complications
 shitayugin kaal main raajnneeti ke swaroop main parivartan tathaa naye rajyon ke udai ne sampoorn antarrashtriya parivesh ko hi badal diya
 As a result, new approaches, dimensions, institutions and trends were created through which the study of international relations was ensured
 purv charnon kii aadarshik, sansthagat, naitik, kanoonee evam sudhaarwadi dhaaraon kii asafalataaon ne naye upagamon ke vikaas kii ore agrasar kiya
 This new approach was realism

 According to this theory, states are always struggling to fulfill their interests
 atah anterrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane hetu is shakti sangharsh ke vibhinn ayaamon ko samajhnaa ati aavashyak he
 International organization also originated in the form of assured and unambiguous development of international institutions with realistic outlook
 ab is sanghathan kaa swaroop maatra adarshavaadi va sudhaarwadi na hokar, mahatvapurn raajnneetik sanghathan ke rup main ubhar kar aayaa
 Under this, apart from saving mankind from the ravages of war, what are the reasons for the conflict between the states? What are the risk factors for world peace? How can peace be established? How can arms race be stopped? Efforts were also made to find solutions to many types of questions
 uparokt do pravritiyon ke saath-saath vyavahaarwad kii utpatti bhi is yug kii mahatvapurn uplabdhi rahi
 An attempt was made to understand international politics by creating "system theory" through a pragmatic approach
 is upaagam ke antargat rajyon ke adhyayan hetu teen pramukh karkon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa zaruri mana gaya
 These factors were- uparokt pravritiyon kaa mukhya bal antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saiddhantikaran ko badhaava dena rahaa he
 Therefore, it has been a very important task in this era to propose the universal principles of international politics
 siddhanth nirmaan kii is prakriya ke parinaam swaroop anek aanshik siddhanton jaise - yatharthwaad, santulan kaa siddhanth, sanchaar siddhanth, krida siddhanth, saudebaaji kaa siddhanth, shaanti anusandhan drushtikon, vyavastha siddhanth, vishwa vyavastha pratimaan aadi kaa nirmaan hua
 Despite the rendering of these principles, there still remains a lack of any universal and common principle in this era
 1990 ke dashak main jaint bandhopadhyaay ne apni pustak - general theory of international rilations - main martin kaplan ke vyavasthaaparak siddhanth kii kamiyon ko dur kar ek saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana kii koshish kii he, parantu vah bhi abhi vaad-pratwaad ke daur main hi hai
 Therefore, despite the main phase of theorization, the era of the Cold War remained deprived of any one general principle due to its ideological narrowness and isolation
 shityudhottar yug main sabhi rashtron dwaara ek aarthik vyavastha ke antargat judana prarambh kar diya
 That is why the era of globalization, liberalization, free market system etc
 has started
 is sandarbh main na keval aarthik muddon kaa hi mahatv badha, apitu antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa mahatv or bhi bad gaya
 Today, the distinction of nationalism and internationalism has ended
 Apart from this, now the table of international politics has included a lot of new topics which, instead of being national, now emerge as problems of mankind
 vartmaan vishwa kii pramukh samasyaon main aatankwaad, paryaavaran, ozon parat ksheen hona, nashile padaarthon evam maadak dravyon kii taskari, maanavadhikaron kaa hanan aadi pramukh mudde ubhar kar saamne aaye jinka rashtriya str yaa kshetray str kii bajaay antarrashtriya str par hal nikaalnaa anivaary ban gaya he
 Even at the theoretical level, the attempt to establish the universal principle from 1945 to 1991 got a shock
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii is sandarbh main ab praathamiktaayen badal gai
 In post-modernism, the significance of universal principles are now being questioned
 aitihaasik sandarbh evam pracheen parivesh ke prabhaav ko bhi nakaara ja rahaa he
 Now the independent issues have become more important
 vrihat siddhanth gaun ho gaye hai
 Partial research has become more important in the new context
 udhaahranswaroop nariwad, maanavadhikaar, paryaavaran aadi vishyon par adhik bal dene ke saath-saath chintan bhi prarambh ho gaya he
 Therefore, in the post-cold War era, the nature, content and subject area of international politics have completely changed
 ab saamaanya saiddhanthik sthapana par bhi adhik bal nahin diya ja rahaa he
 That is why, in this changed environment, international politics seems to be not only important but also towards autonomy
 or vishay kii swaittata hetu ashaavadi sanket dikhaai dete hai
 The Second World War not only influenced international politics fundamentally, but also expressed many important issues
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke karkon main parivartan, karkon ko vyapak swaroop pradaan karnaa, naveen siddhanton kaa pratipaadan aadi anek vishyon ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa purna parivesh hi badal kar rakh diya he
 While there is a debate on the theoretical level of realism and idealism on the one hand, and on the ancient and scientific debate, on the other hand controversial questions were being raised about the format of international relations topic - whether international relations is a Autonomous subject or not? Although it is being taught as an autonomous subject at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and research in most universities today, it is not recognized as equivalent to other subjects of social science
 itnaa avashya hua he ki viksit deshon main to kai vishvavidhyalayon main ise purna rup se swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Developing countries like India have also improved
 yahaan prarambh main ‘bhartiya antarrashtriya sambandh skool, nai dilli’ jo baad main jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya sambandh skool ke rup main swytt rup se kaary kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, many other universities like Jadavpur University, Calcutta, Goa University etc
 have also got the status of autonomous subjects
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ko ek swytt vishay ke rup main adhyayan karne se purv ek baat spasht kerani ati aavashyak he ki jab ham is vishay kii swaittata ke prashn kaa adhyayan karte hai to ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ va antarrashtriya sambandhon ko alag-alag vishay nahin maanate hai
 This has been done because both disciplines are still recognized as a sub-discipline of the subject of political science rather than as an autonomous discipline
 duusare inkaa vibhed itnaa sookshm he ki anushaasan kii swaittata kii pramanikta ke baad is vishay ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In the context of considering international politics as an autonomous subject, three different views have been given which are as follows - jo vidwaan is vishay ko swytt maanate hai unke anusaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay vastu va anushaasan sambandhi saamagree ko dekhte hue ise ek swytt vishay mana janaa chahie
 The main proponents of this argument are - CAW
 Manning, Quincy Right, Robert Lotting Allen, Hannes J
 Margenthau, Carl M
 Copper Johnson, Hoffmann; AL Burn etc
 in vidwaanon ne nimna aadhaaron par ise swytt vishay pramanit kiya he- Those scholars who do not consider international politics as an autonomous subject, believe that there is no such unique thing in this subject that it should be considered autonomous for study
 unhone nimna tarko ke aadhaar par apni baat kaa samarthan kiya he- Some scholars consider both of the above debates as meaningless
 unka maananaa yah he ki uparyukt donon tarkon ko antarrashtriya raajnneeti main hue vikaas ke madhyam se adhik bhalee prakaar se janaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, a review of the development of the 20th century, and especially after 1945, is extremely essential
 yadi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii swaittata ke prashn kaa gahan adhyayan karte hai to pataa chalata he ki is sandarbh main do moolbhoot samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 One, there have been effective changes in the nature, content and methods of international relations
 doosraa, isi samay raajnneetishastra kii paridhi kii jatiltaaon evam aparibhaashit simaaon ke vikaas ke kaaran samasya or bad gai he
 But if we look at the development of international politics from 1919 till date, it is clear that its achievements will prove very helpful in giving it autonomy
 1919 ke baad se hi, visheshkar america main, bahut se vidwaanon ne is vishay ko adhik se adhik vaigyanik banane hetu prayaas kiye hai
 Efforts have also been made to explain its content, methods and principles

 car aadi kaa yogadan saraahneey rahaa he
 After a review in this context, Richard Smythbeel has come to the conclusion that- dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad is sthiti main mahatvapurn parivartan aae hai
 On the one hand, on the one hand, based on new researches in this field, the international relations analytic relations have been strengthened, on the other hand new theories have also been formulated
 america main anek viddhanon mukhya rup se margenthau, richard snidar, martin kaplan, karl dablyoo dois, charles mekalaland aadi ne is ore vishisht yogadan diya he
 In addition, emphasis has been laid on the study of both developed and developing countries
 isaki vishay saamagree kaa sankalan, siddhanth pratipaadan evam paddatiyon kaa bhi kaaphi vikaas hua he
 But even today, the most important deficiency remains the lack of a universal / general principle
 shityudhottar vishwa main iskaa mahatv or bad gaya he
 In this era of globalization, all the states are getting connected with one type of economic system
 antarrashtriya va rashtriya mudde jaise paryaavaran, aatankwaad, nariwad, adj, ozon parat ksheen hona, maanavadhikaar aadi rashtriya kii bajaay maanviya / maanavjaati se sambhddha ho gaye hai
 Therefore, active participation of international forums / organizations is necessary to solve all these
 ab saarvbhaumik siddhanth ko bhi uttar aadhunikwaad kii drushti se nakaar kar vyaktiparak evam sthaneey aadhaar par adhik bal diya gaya he
 Therefore, on the basis of the development after 1945, it can be said to be leading to autonomy, which after 1991 the process of the end of the Cold War has tried to strengthen

 But no Western scholar adopted the Indian Vedas commentary method, which Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati used to illustrate in his foreign languages at the same time

 First in England, in 1811, arrangements were made for the education of Sanskrit language at Oxford University
 iske liye ek kattar isai saamne aayaa
 He was Colonel Joseph Boden, who was a lieutenant-colonel in the East India Company's army in Bombay
 isane avkaash grahan karne ke baad, apni samast sampatti, jo us samay lagbhag pachchisahjaar pound thi, kii vasiyat oxford vishvavidhyalay main sanskrit-professor ke ek pad kii sthapana ke kiye kar di; or vishvavidhyalay ne bhi kritagyata swaroop isna naam 'boden chair of sanskrit rakh diya
 The purpose of the Boden Chair, like the Gurukuls of India, was not merely to teach the Sanskrit language from a literary point of view, but to serve the religious interests of Britain's political and Christian missionaries
 karnal boden ne apni vasiyat, jo ki 15 agast 1811 ko cantarbari, euke ke nyaayalay main registerd kii gai, uske mukhay ansh or uddeshy is prakaar hai: That is, i donate to all my Oxford University

 Thus in 1811, the Sanskrit Chair was established at the University of Oxford, but no person could be found for it at that time

 Based on this Sanskrit knowledge, Wilson was made the first Sovereign of the Boden Chair of Sanskrit at Oxford University in 1832
 yahan usne sabase pehle mishnariyon ke liye di religen and philosophical system of di hindooj naamak pustak likhi
 About the purpose of writing this book, he said: arthath yah lekhamala un vyaktiyon kii sahaayta ke liye likhi gai hai jo ki mu dwaara sthapit do saun pound ke puraskaar ke liye pratyaashee hon or jo hindu dharm granthon kaa sarvottam prakaar se khandan kar saken
 In 1860, after Prof
 Wilson's death, the second chairman of the Boden Chair was Mounier Williams
 1819 main bombay main janma maunier ek kattar isai tha
 It was even more committed to destroying Hinduism as he wrote in his book 'A sanskrit-english Dictionary': "in explanation i must draw attention to the fact that i am only the second occupant of the Boden Chair, and that its founder, Col
 Boden, stated most explicitly in his will that the special object of his munificent bequest was to promote the translation of the Scripture in Sanskrit so as to enable his countrymen to procet'd in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion
" "it was on this account that, when my distinguished predecessor and teacher, Professor HH Wilson, was a candidate for the chair in 1832, his lexicographical labors were put forward as his principal claim to election
" "surely it" need not be thought surprising, if following in the footsteps of my venerated master, i have made it the chief aim of my professional life to provide facilities for the translation of the Sacred Scriptures in Sanskrit and for the promotion of a better knowledge of the religions and customs of India, as the best key to a knowledge of the religious needs of our great Eastern Dependency
 My very first public lecture delivered after my election in 1860 was on "the Study of Sanskrit in Relation to Missionary Work in India" 
 That is to say, i would like to draw attention to the fact that i am only the second head of the boden-chair and its founder Colonel Boden has written most clearly in his will that the specific purpose of his will is to translate Sanskrit theology
 So that the people of his country would be able to convert the original inhabitants of India into Christianity

 In ancient countries such as Rome and Greece, this art has been given full encouragement

 Thus, this type of gilding continued to be stronger and brighter
 purvi deshon kii sajaavat kii kala main iskaa pramukh sthaan he- mandiron ke gumbajon tathaa rajmahalon kii shobhaa badhaane ke liye yah kala visheshat: apanaai jaati he
 The method by which gold is offered in India today is a beautiful example of its antiquity
 aadhunik gilding main tarah tarah kii vidhiyaan prayog main laai jaati hai or inase har prakaar ke satahon par sona chadhaaya ja saktaa he, jaise tasveeron ke frem, almariyon, sajaavati chithran, ghar or mehalon kii sajaavat, kitabon kii jildabaaji, dhaatuon ke avaran, batan bananaa, gild taav trade, printig tathaa vidyut aavaran, mitti ke bartanon, porcillen, kaanch tathaa kaanch kii chudiyon kii sajaavat

 Then it cleans the ante of the surface and put it in an acid solution
 phir use baahar nikaalkar sukhaane ke baad jhanva tathaa surkhi se ragad kar chikanahat paidaa kar dete hai
 After this action, a thin layer of mercury crosses the surface, then pours it in water for some time and thus it becomes gold-pliable
 sone kii baarik pattiyaan chipkaane se ye paare se mil jaati hai
 As a result of heating, the mercury flies away and the gold remains in a state of brownness, rubbing it with agate varnish to make it shiny
 is vidhi main sone kaa praaia: duguna paara lagata he tathaa paare kii pun: prapti nahin hoti
 Chemical gilding involves methods in which the gold used remains as a chemical compound in some form or the other

 After that it is better to offer gold
 is dhang se sone kii baarik se baarik parat kaa aavaran chadhaaya ja saktaa he tathaa jis motaai kaa chahen sone kaa vidyutavaran aavashyaktaanusaar chadha sakate hai
 This protects metals from corrosion and gives a beautiful glow to gold on all types of objects
 kurm avatar ko 'kacchap avatar' bhi kehete hai
 In the incarnation of Kurma, Lord Vishnu held the Mandar mountain on his armor at the time of the ocean of Kshirsagar

 At this time Lord Vishnu also took the form of Mohini
 narsinghpurana ke anusaar kurmavatar dwitiya avatar he jabaki bhagwatpurana ke anusaar gyarahavaan avatar
 It is mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmana, Mahabharata and Padmapuran that Prajapati, for breeding the progeny, takes the form of a tortoise and transmits it in water
 lingapurana ke anusaar prithvi rasaatal ko ja rahi thi, tab vishnu ne kacchaparup main avatar liya
 The circle of the back of the said Kachchap was one lakh yojana
 padmapurana main varnan hai ki indra ne durvasa dwaara pradutt parijatak maala kaa apmaan kiya to kupit hokar durvasa ne shaap diya, tumhaara vaibhav nasht hoga
 As a result Lakshmi disappeared into the sea
 pashchaat vishnu ke aadeshaanusaar devataaon tathaa daityon ne lakshmi ko pun: praapt karne ke liye mandarachal kii mathani tathaa vasuki kii door banaakar kshirsagar kaa manthan kiya
 While churning out the Mandarachal abyss, Vishnu held it on his back in the form of a tortoise and the Devadanavas edited the former glory by acquiring 14 gems including nectar and Lakshmi from the sea
 ekadshi kaa upwas lok main kachmpavataar ke baad hi prachlit hua
 In the Korampurana, Vishnu in his Kachhapavatar described the four goals of life with the sages
 devraj indra ke shaury ko dekh rishi durvasa nen unhen parijaat pushp kii maala bhent kii parantu indra nen ise grahan na karte hue airavat ko pahana diya or airavat nen use bhoomi par phenk diya, durvasa ne isse krodhit hokar devataaon ko shraap de diya, inke devataaon par abhishaap ke kaaran, devataaon ne apni shakti kho di
 Frustrated with this, he reached Brahma for guidance
 unhone devataaon ko bhagwaan vishnu se sampark karne ko kaha
 Vishnu advised them to churn the Ksheer Samudra which would yield nectar
 is amrit ko pine se devon kii shakti waapas aa jaaegi ar ve sadaa ke liye amar ho jaayenge
 This huge work could only be done with the help of Mandar Parvat and Vasuki, where the mountain was used as a stick of Mathini and Vasuki as a rope
 is kaary ke liye asuron kaa bhi sahaara avashyak tha or iske kaaran sabhi devtaa aatankit ho gaye
 But Vishnu explained to them and the Asuras agreed to help the Devas at the behest of them, in the greed of nectar
 ve samudr kaa manthan karne lage, jahaan ek taraf asur the or dusri taraf dev the
 But due to this churn, a deadly poison started coming out which caused suffocation and threatened the whole world
 lekin bhagwaan mahadev bachaav ke liye aae or us zehar kaa seven kiya or apane kanth main use barkaraar rakhaa jisase unka nilkanth naam padaa
 The churning continued but the mountain began to sink slowly
 tabhi bhagwaan vishnu ne kurm avatar main avateern hue ek vishaal kachhue kaa avatar liya taaki apane peet kar pahaad ko uthaa saken
 The diameter of that turtle's back was 100,000 joints
 kamdhenu jaise anya puraskaar samudr se prakat hue aure dhanvatari apane hatho main amrit kalash ke saath prakat hue
 In this way, Kurma incarnation of God took place
