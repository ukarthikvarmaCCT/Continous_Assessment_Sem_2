 The female gives birth to 5 cubs during her life time, her life span is 9 years
 nar shaavak do varsh kii umr main jhund chhod dete hai
 Cubs are often born at the end of the rainy season
 aam taur par maadaa junglee bhaisen or shaavak jhund bana kar rahati he or nar jhund se alag rahete hai par yadi jhund kii koi maadaa garbh dhaaran ke liye taiyaar hoti he to sabase taqatvar nar uske paas kisi or nar ko nahin aane detaa
 This male usually remains around the herd
 yadi kisi shaavak kii maa mar jaye to duusari maadaayen use apana leti hai
 Their natural enemy is tigers, but wild dogs and leopards have also been seen hunting them if the wild buffalo is weak, old or sick
 vaise inako sabase bada khatra paaltu maweshiyon kii sankramit bimariyon se hi he, inamen pramukh beemaari foot and mouth he
 The disease named Rederpest had at one time greatly reduced their numbers
 in par doosraa bada khatra genetic pradooshan he, junglee bhainsa paaltu bhainson se sampark sthapit kar letaa he
 Although researchers such as Flamand and Tulach believe that the wild male buffalo usually does not allow domesticated male buffaloes to approach the female but themselves approach the domesticated female buffalo, the subject is yet to be thoroughly researched
 madhya bharat ke jin ilaakon main yah paaya jaataa he, vahaan kii paaltu bhaisen bhi inase milti julati najar aati he
 This can be understood by a funny incident
 kuch varshon pehle bijapur ke van-mandladhikari shri raman pandya ke saath bambai natural history socity kii ek team junglee bhaison kaa adhyayan karne or chitra lene ke liye indravati rashtriya udyaan pahaunchi, unhen junglee bhainson kaa ek bada jhund najar aayaa or unke saikado chitra liye gayi or ek shriman jo us samay desh main junglee bhainson ke bade jaankaar maane jate the, baaki logo ko junglee bhainson or paaltu bhainson ke bich antar samajhane main vyast ho gayi tabhi achaanak ek charvaaha aayaa or sari bhainson ko haank kar le gaya
 One of the main reasons why wild buffaloes are on the verge of extinction in central India is their behavior
 jahaan ek ore gaur barish main unche sthanon par chale jate hai, vahi junglee bhainse maidaanon main kheton ke aas paas hi rahete hai or kheto ko bahut nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 For this reason the villagers hunt them
 ek kaaran yah bhi he ki prakritik jangalon kaa vinaash kar diya gaya he or unke sthaan par shahari jaruraton ko puraa karne vaale sagaun, saal, nilgiri jaise pedo kaa ropan kar diya he
 Some of these leaves are inedible, they do not grow the grass under which they eat, anyway wild buffalo feeds very selectively
 is kaaran bhi inkaa gaanv waalon se takaraav bahut bad gaya he
 One of the reasons for increasing conflict is that the tribals used to cultivate without the Berwa system earlier
 isame unako zyada mehnat nahin kerani padati thi
 Pieces of the forest were burnt and seeds were sprinkled in them without stirring
 raakh ek behad uttam urvarak kaa kaam karti thi
 The yield was also very good
 iske alaava jangalo main kandamul or fal bhi prachurtaa se mil jate the
 They did not lack food even from the occasional hunt
 ve kheti par purna rup se nirbhar nahin the
 Therefore, there was no hatred in them when some part of the crop was eaten by the wild animals
 or har do yaa teen saal main jagah badal liye jane ke kaaran pichhli jagah ghaas ke maidan ban jate the
 There was no shortage of fodder for the wild animals
 atah yada kada kiye jane vaale shikaar se unki sankhya main koi kami nahin aati thi
 Now, the tribals have permanent farms, whose fertility is progressively decreasing
 or iname hal chalaanaa kharpatvaar nikaalnaa or urvarak daalane jaise kaam karne padate he, jiname kaafii shram or paisa lagata he
 Apart from this, it is also not allowed to take bamboo and other forest produce for the siege of the fields, so now the tribals become known enemies of wild animals at the loss of their crops
 inhi sab karno se junglee bhainse aaj durlabhtam praaniyon ke shrenee main aa gayi hai
 Well all this has been done and it is not in our power to make up for this loss
 lekin ek jagah aisi he jo aaj tak vikaas ke vinaash se achhuti he
 The place is still the same as nature has made it through the evolutionary order of millions of years, where even today the farming is done by the merciless system and where even today the forest buffalo can be seen gracefully in large herds, where a large number of Tigers, bears, drums, mountain mynas and many other animals are living their lives in peace

 And the most regrettable thing is that our government is going to implement the schemes that they had instigated the tribals by showing fear
 abujhmaad main bina pahunche or bina koi adhyayan karaaye yahaan khadaanon kaa aavanton kiya ja rahaa he
 And this heritage of our descendants will not be destroyed because there is a scarcity of iron ore in the country, but the greed of the mine-holders who have already become wealth mines by exporting this ore has now broken all boundaries and they have become so powerful
 Are, now they dance at their behest, not leaders
 unki najaron main vanyapraani or adivaasiyon kii koi keemat nahin
 Words like natural imbalance, global warming, dehydration of rivers and famine have nothing to do with them
 jab tak duniya main ek bhi jagah rahane laayak rahegi tab tak inke paas maje se jeene kaa paisa to bharpoor hoga hi
 Due to these misdeeds, the population of wild buffaloes remaining in our forests will also be destroyed

 chhayaprabhav kii takanic jo rekhachitr main banaavat bhi utpann karti he usamen haiching or stipling shaamil hai
 There are many other ways of generating formation in a picture: Apart from choosing a suitable paper, different types of drawing materials and drawing techniques will result in different formation
 The form of the formation can be made more realistic when it is drawn closer to an asymmetric formation; a thicker texture will be more apparent when it is placed next to a smooth blended area
 a similar effect can be achieved by drawing different colors, closer together, next to a darker background, a lighter edge will be visible directly to the eye and floating almost above the surface

 By placing a finger on a point near the drawing tool, that dimension of the image can be compared with other parts
 ek rekhni kaa istemaal ek sidhi-kinari or anupaat kii gananaa karne kii ek yukti, donon ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 At the time of creating a complex shape such as a human figure, it is convenient to initially represent the form with a set of initial shapes
 Almost any form can be represented by some combination of cube, sphere, cylinder, and cone
 ek baar ye buniyadi aakaar jab ek swaroop main ikatthe kar die jate hai, to aarekhan ko ek adhik sateek or saafe rup main parishkrut kiya ja saktaa he
 The lines of the initial shapes are removed and replaced by the final shapes

 This allows the artist to introduce more natural variations that do not appear artificially stiff
 The artist is also familiar with how the ratio changes depending on the age of the subject, especially at the time of drawing a drawing
 raikhik pariprekshya, ek sapaat sataha par vastuon ke chithran kii ek aisi vidhi he jisamen duuri ke saath aayam sikudte jate hai
 The parallel, straight edges of any object, whether a building or a table, will follow the lines that eventually converge to infinity
 Typically this point of convergence is adjacent to the horizon, since buildings are constructed with flat surface levels
 jab kai sanrachanaayen ek duusare ke saath mili hoti hai jaise ek sadak ke kinare bani imaaraten, tab sanrachanaon kaa anuprastha sheersh or tal aam taur par ek lopi bindu par milte hai
 When the front and side of the building are made, parallel lines forming one side meet at another point along the horizon
 This is a "two-point perspective"
 akaash main ek bindu par yah khadi rekhaon kaa abhisaran karata he or phir ek "teen-sutri pariprekshya" utpann karata he
 Depth can also be represented by several other techniques in addition to the above perspective approach
 samaan aakaar kii vasteen darshak se jitani dur hongi utani hi choti prathit hongi
 is tarah ek gaadi kaa pichhlaa pahiyaa saamne vaale pahiyaa se chota dikhaai degaa
 gaharaai ko banaavat ke upyog ke madhyam se darshaya ja saktaa he
 As the texture of an object fades away it becomes more compressed and dense and takes a completely different form than that if it were to pass
 Depth can be depicted by reducing the amount of contrast of more distant objects, and also by fading the color more
 This can reproduce the effect of atmospheric haze and prompts the eye to focus on objects that have been created in the foreground
 ek kalatmak ucchata kii dilachasp kriti ke nirmaan ke liye tasviir kii sanrachana ek mahatvapurn tatva he
 The artist plans the location of elements in art to communicate ideas and feelings with the audience
 sanrachana, kala ke centre ko nirdhaarit kar sakati he or ek saamanjasypurna samagrata ko falit karti he jo saundaryabodh kii drushti se apil or uttejit karata he
 Decoration of the subject is also an important element in creating an artistic work and the interaction of light and shadow is a valuable way in the artist's box
 prakaash sroton kii avasthiti prastut kiye ja rahe sandesh kii prakruti main kaaphi fark kar sakati he
 For example, multi-light sources can eliminate wrinkles on a person's face and give a more youthful appearance
 iske vipareet, ek ekal prakaash strot, jaise din kaa tej prakaash, kisi bhi banaavat yaa dilachasp lakshanon ko ujagar karne kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 When creating an object or figure, a skilled artist pays attention to both the area within the photograph and the spring outside
 bahari kshetra ko nakaaratmak sthaan kaha jaataa he or prastutikaran main yah utana hi mahatvapurn ho saktaa he jitani kii akruti
 akruti kii prishthbhumi main rakhi gai vastu uchit rup se rakhi hui dikhni chahie jahaan use dekha ja saktaa he
 a study is a draft drawing that is drawn for a planned final photograph
 adhyayan kaa upyog, puri ho chuki tasviir ke vishisht bhaagon ke rup ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he yaa antim lakshya ko puraa karne hetu sabase achche drushtikon ke saath prayog karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 However, a well-crafted study can be a work of art in itself and it may take several hours of careful work to complete a study
 computer kala, kalakaar ke sidhe prabhaav main chhavi utpann karne ke liye digital upkarnon kaa prayog he, aamtaur par kisi ingit upkaran ke madhyam se jaise ek tablet yaa ek mouse
 ise computer-janit kala se alag pahachaanaa jaataa he, jise kalakaar dwaara nirmit ganitiya model ke prayog se computer dwaara utpann kiya jaataa he
 Computer art also differs from digital manipulation of photographs in that it is an original creation "from zero"

 Jellyfish or jelly or sea jelly or medusozoa, or Gizgijia is a free-swimmer member of the association of Nideria
 jelifish ke kai alag rup hai jo scyphosoa, storosoa, cubosoa or hydrosoa sahit vibhinn niderian virgon kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 In these groups, jellyfish are also called, respectively, scyphomedusae, storomedusae, cubomedusae and hydromedusae
 sabhi jelifish upsang medusosoa main sannihit hai
 Medusa is another term for jellyfish and is therefore used exclusively for the adult phase of the life-cycle
 jelifish har samudr main, sataha se samudr kii gaharaai tak paae jate hai
 Some hydrozoi jellyfish, or hydromedusae, are also found in fresh water; Freshwater species are one inch in diameter, colorless and do not sting
 orelia jaise kai suvikhyath jelifish, scyphomeduse hai
 These are large, often colorful jellyfish, commonly found in coastal areas around the world
 apane vyapak arth main, shabd jelifish aam taur par sangh tinophora ke sadasyon ko nirdisht karata he
 Although not closely related to the Niderian jellyfish, the tinophore free-swimmers are planktonic carnivores, which are generally transparent or translucent and present in shallow to deep parts of all oceans of the world
 sher ayaal jelifish sarvaadhik vikhyath jelifish hai or vivaadaaspad taur par duniya kaa sabase lanbaa jaanavar he
 Since jellyfish are not actually fish, the term jellyfish is considered a misnomer and American public aquariums have popularized the use of the words jelly or sea jelly instead
 kai anya jelifish ko, jo ek sadi se bhi zyaada samay se aam prachlan main he, utana hi upyogi or suramya maanate hai or jelly se zyaada is shabd ko pasand karte hai
 The term jellyfish is used to denote several different types of niderion, all of which have a basic anatomical appearance resembling an umbrella, including scyphozoi, storozoi, hydrozoi, and cubozoic organisms
 kuch pathyapustaken or website scyphojoi ko "asli jelifish" ke rup main sanderbhit karti hai
 In its widespread use, some scientists, when referring to jellyfish, sometimes include members of the association Tinophora
 anya vaigyanik jal stambh main komal sharir vaale jantuon ke saath, inkaa sandarbh dete samay sabko shaamil karne vaale shabd "geletins zuplancton" kaa prayog pasand karte hai

 Jellyfish "erupt" by their life-cycle nature, often produced by their perpetual polyps upon sunlight and plankton growth, causing them to appear suddenly and often in large numbers, even when the balance of the ecosystem Is made up "jhund" kaa upyog ek prakaar se saath rahane kii sakriy kshamta kaa sanket detaa he, jaise ki orelia, moon jelly kii kuch prajatiyaan pradarshit karti hai
 Many jellyfish have a second part of their life cycle, which is called the polyp phase
 jab ekal nishechit andey se utpann ek polip stolon kahalaane vaale utakon ke reshon dwaara ek-duusare se jude, anek polip gucchh main viksit hote hai, to unhen "sanghajivi" kaha jaataa he
 Some polyps never proliferate and are referred to as "unicorn" subcastes
 jelifish main vishesh pachan, paraasaran-niyantrak, kendriya tantrika, shwasan, yaa raktavahi pranaliyaan nahin hoti hai
 They digest using the gastric-lining of the gastric-vascular cavity, where nutrients are absorbed
 unhen shwasan pranali kii jarurat nahin he kyonki unki twachaa itani patali hoti he ki sharir visaran dwaara oxikaran karata he
 They have limited control over movement, but can move through the contraction-pulsing of their bellied body using a hydrostatic skeleton; Some species actively swim most of the time, while others remain inactive much of the time
 jelifish 90% jal se sanghatit hote hai; unki chhatari kii adhikansh maatra shleshiya saamagree misogliya naamak-jelly-se bani hoti he, jo upakalaa koshikaon kii do paraton dwaara ghiri hoti he, jo ghanti, yaa sharir ke chhatra or upachhatra ko banaate hai
 Jellyfish do not have a brain or central nervous system, but rather a loose network of nerves located in the epidermis, which is called the "neural network"

 Some jellyfish also have eyespots: light-sensitive organs that do not make pictures, but which can detect light and determine the top and bottom of the water surface, reacting to sunlight
 ye aam taur par varnak bindu netrak hote hai, jinaki kuch koshikaayen ranjit hoti hai
 The presence of oceanic eruptions in response to prey availability and increased temperature and sunlight is generally seasonal

 In addition to occasionally being concentrated by ocean currents, eruption can also result in unusually high populations in a few years
 prasphuton nirmaan ek jatil prakriya he jo sagar kii dhaaraon, poshak tatwon, taapmaana, parbhakshan or oxigen sandratha par nirbhar he
 Jellyfish are better able to survive in water with less oxygen than their competitors and thus can thrive on plankton without competition
 jelifish lavniya jal se bhi labhanvit ho sakate hai, chunki lavan jal main adhik iodine hota he, jo polipon ko jelifish main badalane ke liye aavashyak he
 Rising sea temperatures due to climate change may also contribute to jellyfish eruption, as many species of jellyfish are better able to survive in warm waters

 In some places jellyfish may fill ecological niches that were previously occupied by more aquatic organisms, but noted that this hypothesis lacks supporting data

 Monty Graham of the Doffin Island Oceanographic Laboratory in Alabama states that "ecological systems, which have high levels of nutrients
 

 sookshm jeevon ke liye poshan pradaan karti hai, jinase jelifish aahaar grahan karte hai
 Water where there is hygiene often results in lower oxygen levels, favoring jellyfish since they can tolerate less oxygenated water than fish

 Areas most seriously affected by jellyfish include the northern Mexico Gulf, about which Graham says "moon jellies have formed a type of synovial mesh that extends from one end of the bay to the other
 " Jellyfish eruption causes problems for mankind

 Many jellyfish go through two different life history stages during their life cycle
 pehla polipid charan he, jab jantu poshak sparshakon ke saath ek chote danthal kaa aakaar grahan karata he; yah polip sthanbaddh ho saktaa he, jo bedon yaa naav ke tal jaisi nichali sataha yaa isi tarah ke adhbstar par jeeta he, yaa vah mukt-tairta hua yaa mukt-jivi plavak ke chote tukdon yaa virale hi, machhlee yaa anya aksheruki jeevon se judaa hota he
 The polyp usually has a mouth surrounded by upward tentacles similar to anthozoi as well as small polyps close to the union nideria
 polip ekaaki yaa sanghajivi ho sakate hai or kuch vibhinn tareeqon se alangik taur par, anek polip utpann karte hue prasphutit hote hai
 Many are very small, measured in millimeters
 duusare charan main, chote polip alangik taur par jelifish utpann karte hai, jinamein se prayek medusa ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Small jellyfish swim away from the polyp and then grow and feed on plankton
 medusa main trigyi samamik, chhatari ke aakaar kaa sharir hota he jo ghanti kehalaata he, jo saamanytah shikaar pakadaney vaale ghanti ke kinare ke chote ubhaar jaise-simavarti sparshakon se yukt hota he
 Some species of jellyfish do not have a polyp part in their life cycle, but they pass on to the next generation of jellyfish through the direct development of fertilized eggs from jellyfish
 jelifish ekalingashrayi hai, arthath ve aam taur par nar yaa maadaa hai 
 In most cases, both release sperm and eggs into the surrounding waters, where the eggs are fertilized and mature into a new organism
 kuch prajatiyon main, shukranu maadaa ke munh main tair kar maadaa ke sharir ke bheetar andey nishechit karte hai jahaan ve vikaas ke praarambhik daur main maujuud rahete hai
 In moon jelly, eggs settle in pits of oral arms, which form a temporary children's chamber for developing planula larvae
 nishechan or praarambhik vikaas ke baad, planula naamak kitdimbh rup viksit hota he
 The planula is a small larva surrounded by follicles
 yah thos sataha par jam jaataa he or polip ke rup main viksit hota he
 The polyp is shaped like a cup with a face surrounded by tentacles, which looks like a small ocean
 vruddhi antaraal ke baad, polip prasphutit dwaara alangik rup se prajnan shuru karata he or scyphosoa main yah khandit polip, yaa skyphistoma kehalaata he
 New scyphistomes may arise by proliferation or new immature jellies called ephyra may be formed
 kuch jelifish kii prajatiyaan medusa str se sidhe prasphuton dwaara nae medusa utpann kar sakate hai
 The eruption sites vary by species; Ranges from tentacles, bulbs to manubrium, or hydromedusae
 Some species of Hydromedusae breed by fission
 jelifish kii anya prajatiyaan sabase aam or mahatvapurn shikari jelifish main se hai, jinamein se kuch jelly ke visheshgy hai
 Other predators include tuna, sharks, swordfish, sea turtles and at least one species of Pacific salmon
 Sea birds sometimes pick up symbiotic crusts of jellyfish bells near the sea surface, essentially feeding on these waterfowl or small jellyfish nutrients of crab and prawns
 jelifish kii jivanavadhi aam taur par kuch ghanton se lekar kai maheenon ke bich hoti he
 Life-span and maximum size vary by species

 sabase bade tateey jelifish 2 se 6 maheene tak jivit rahete hai, jis dauraan ve ek yaa do millimetre se badhkar vyas main kai centimetre ho jate hai
 They eat continuously and attain adult size quite rapidly
 vayask aakaar tak pahunchane ke baad, paryaapt bhojan ho to jelifish har din andey dete hai
 In many species, undercurrent is controlled by light, so the entire population lays eggs at the same time of day, often in the morning or evening
 keval rizostome varg se sambandhit scyphoxn ko bhojan ke liye pakadaa jaataa he; 85 prajatiyon main se lagbhag 12 ekatrit kiye jate hai or antarrashtriya bazaaron main beche jate hai

 Traditional processing methods performed by the Jellyfish Master include a 20- to 40-day multi-step process, in which after removing the gonads and mucous membranes, the umbrella and oral arms are processed, and compressed, with a mixture of salt and alum
 prasanskaran taralata, durgandh or vikrut karne vaale sookshmjivon ko kam kar detaa he or jelifish ko "kurkura or khasta gathan" utpann karte hue shushk or amleey banaata he
 Jellyfish prepared in this manner maintain 7-10% of their original weight and the processed product contains about 94% water and 6% protein
 tazaa sansaadhit jelifish main safed, malaaidaar rang hota he jo lambey samay tak bhandaaran ke dauraan pile yaa bhure rang main badal jaataa he
 In China, processed jellyfish are soaked overnight in water and desalinated and cooked or eaten raw
 vyanjan ko aksar kaat kar tel, soya sos, sirka or chini se taiyaar kiya jaataa he, yaa subjiyon ke saath salad ke rup main parosa jaataa he
 In Japan, salt-planted jellyfish are washed, sliced into strips and served as an appetizer with vinegar
 vilwanikrut, khaane ke liye taiyaar utpaada bhi uplabdh hai
 To export to Asia by the fisheries, the American cannonball jellyfish, Stomolophus milligris, has been introduced near the South Atlantic coast of the United States and into the Gulf of Mexico

 Jellyfish are also caught for their collagen, which can be used for a wide variety of applications, including the treatment of rheumatic arthritis
 kai deshon main jelifish ko machhleegharon main pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 Often the tank has a blue background and the animals are illuminated with lateral light, increasing the contrast between the animal and the background

 Contact with jellyfish tentacles can cause millions of nematocysts to pierce the skin and inject venom, however the sting of only a few jellyfish species causes adverse reactions in humans
 jab ek nimatocist shikari yaa shikaar ke sampark se prerit hota he, to usamen tezi se 2,000 lbs / varg inch tak dabaav banaata he jab tak ki vah fat nahin jaataa
 nimatocist ke andar ek lans shikaar kii twachaa ko bhedata he or shikaar ke andar zehar bahane lagata he
 Touching or being touched by a jellyfish can be very uncomfortable, sometimes requiring medical help; The effect of sting can range from no effect to extreme pain and death
 jelifish dank ke prati pratikriya kii vyapak vibhinnata ke kaaran, anaavruth twachaa se jelifish ke sampark main na aane main hi budhimaani he
 Even seaside and dying jellyfish can sting when touched

 Stings can cause anaphylaxis, which can lead to death
 isliye, peediton ko tatkaal pani se baahar ho janaa chahie
 Antibiotic ablution is also included in medical care

 yadi sirka anuplabdh ho, to namak kaa pani bhi upyog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 If there is a sting in the salty water, do not use fresh water, because the tonic changes may release additional toxin
 ghaav ko ragadne yaa alcohoul, spirit, ammonia yaa mutr ke upyog se bachein jo vish chhodane ko protsaahit karte hai
 By clearing jelly, tentacles and moisture from the place, nematocyst stimulation is further reduced
 prabhavit twachaa ko chaaku kii dhar, ustara yaa credit card se shev karne se baaqi nimatocist bhi hat sakate hai
 In addition to first aid, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine can control skin irritation
