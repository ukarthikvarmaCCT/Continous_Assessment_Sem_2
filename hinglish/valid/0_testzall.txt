 Meera Dingra is a freedom loving girl
 uske isi swabhaav ke kaaran kai saare shaadi ke prastaav tut jate hai, jisase uski maan pareshaan ho jaati he
 While living in London, Vivaan Kapoor comes to India in search of his mother

 Seeing the danger, Vivaan closes Meera in a room and comes to the place of Roma
 vahaan wo jaaydaad ke kagajaat main dastakhat ke badale pammi ko chhodane kii baat kahati he
 Meanwhile Meera comes there and takes the gun in her hands
 isi bich roma bandook chhin kar vivaan kii ore goli chalaa detii he, par bich main pammi aa jaati he or use goli lag jaati he
 After which Roma and his companions run away from there and Vivaan and Meera take her to the hospital
 aspataal main vivaan apane kiye kaamon ke bare main soch soch kar duhkhi hote rahata he ki kis prakaar usne apni maan ke bare main itnaa bura sochaa or kaha tha or kabhi bhi mira ke kisi bhi baat par vishwaas nahin kiya

 aaie jaanate hai kya he pika bidroh
 Paika Bidroh, which took place in Odisha in 1817, had shaken the British Raj's roots in eastern India for some time
 Originally, Paika was an unorganized army of peasants of the Gajapati teachers of Odisha, who provided military services to the king during wartime and did farming in peacetime
 These people raised the flag of revolt against the British Raj under the leadership of Bakshi Jagabandhu Bidyadhar in 1817
 khurda ke shaasha paramparaagat rup se jagannatha mandir ke sangrakshak the or dharti par unke pratinidhi ke taur par shashan karte the

 british raaj ne odisha ke uttar main sthit bengal praant or dakshin main sthit madras praant par adhikaar karne ke baad angrejon ne 1803 main odisha ko bhi apane adhikaar main kar liya tha
 us samay odisha ke gajpati raja mukundadev dwitiya avyask the or unke sangrakshak jai raajaguru dwaara kiye gaye shuruaati pratirodh kaa krurta purvak daman kiya gaya or jayaguru ke sharir ke jinda rahete hue hi tukade kar die gaye
 After a few years, the Paika rebels led by Bakshi Jagabandhu, the hereditary chief of the unorganized army of Gajapati kings, revolted with the support of tribals and other sections of society
 The Paika Rebellion began in 1817 and spread very rapidly
 Although the Paika people played an important role in the rebellion against the British Raj, this rebellion was not in any sense a rebellion of a small group of people belonging to a particular class
 ghumsur jo ki vartmaan main ganjam or kandhamal jile kaa hissaa he, vahaan ke adivaasiyon or anya virgon ne is vidroh main sakriy bhoomika nibhaai
 vastav main pika vidroh ke vistaar kaa sahi avasar tab aayaa, jab ghumsur ke 400 adivaasiyon ne british raaj ke khilaaf baghawat karte hue khurda main pravesh kiya
 khurda, jahaan se angrej bhaag gaye the, vahaan kii taraf kooch karte hue pika vidrohiyon ne british raaj ke pratikon par hamalaa karte hue police thanon, prashaskeey karyaalayon or rajkosh main aag laga di
 The Paika rebels had the support of the kings, zamindars, village princes and common farmers of Kanika, Kujang, Nayagarh and Ghumsur
 This rebellion spread very fast in other areas of the province like Purl, Peepli and Cuttack
 The British were stunned before the rebellion, but later they tried to retain the hegemony but they had to face stiff resistance from the Paika rebels
 In several subsequent battles, the rebels won, but within three months the British finally succeeded in defeating them
 iske baad daman kaa vyapak daur chalaa jisamen kai logon ko jail main daalaa gaya or apni jaan bhi ganvaani padi
 bahut badi sankhya main logon ko atyaacharon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 kai vidrohiyon ne 1819 tak gorilla yuddh ladaa, lekin ant main unhen pakad kar maar diya gaya
 bakshi jagabandhu ko antat: 1825 main giraftaar kar liya gaya or kaid main rahete hue hi 1829 main unki mrityu ho gai
 Though the Paika Rebellion enjoys a very high status in Odisha and children grow up reading stories of valor in the fight against the British, this rebellion unfortunately did not get the national prominence it deserved
 There can be many reasons behind giving such less importance to such an important event, but it is a matter of satisfaction that the Government of India has decided to appropriately celebrate the 200th anniversary of this incident to give proper recognition to this rebellion

 The terms of these treaties were different for every princely state, but basically under every treaty, the princely states had to take the permission of the British on matters related to foreign affairs, relations and agreements with other princely states and the army and security

 By the middle of the 19th century, the British Empire had established its supremacy and heroism in the Indian subcontinent and established itself as the only hero in India

 The British government used to appoint a permanent officer for each state, who was called a resident

 The Resident was an advisor appointed by the British Government whose job was to represent the British Government in the princely states and to put British interests before the rulers

 The Mahar Scouts and their forces were recruited by the Maratha king Shivaji as soldiers in the fort

 The Bombay Army favored the Mahar soldiers for their bravery and loyalty to the flag and also because they could be trusted during the anglo-maratha War

 After the rebellion the British officers of the Indian Army, especially those who had served in the First and Second Afghan Wars, began to give currency to the martial race doctrine
 yah siddhant tha ki kuch bhartiya jatiyon or samudaayon ke bich swaabhaavik rup se jangi, or adhik dusron kii tulana main yuddh ke liye anukool the
 a major proponent of this doctrine was Lord Roberts, who in November 1885 was the commander-in-chief, gradually "punjabisation" of the Indian Army to the detriment of other communities of the Indian Army
 mahaar sainikon ke liye antim jhatka, 1892 main aayaa jab yah "varg regimenton" santhaan ko bhartiya sena main nirnay liya gaya
 The Mahars were not included in these class regiments, and it was notified that the Mahars, along with some other classes, were now enlisted in the Indian Army
 mahaar sainikon, jo 104 vysarai kamishan adhikari or gaiyr kamishan adhikariyon or sipaahiyon ke ek mejabaan shaamil demobilized the
 This incident was perceived by the Mahars as a betrayal of their loyalty by a governmental they had worked for over a hundred years
 After the demobilisation of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilized
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 B
 R
 Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganisation of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, BR Ambedkar was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col v
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer noticed in dispatches
 They are also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Center was established at Kamptee
 The following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun Regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 His entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 panini sanskrit bhashaa ke sabase bade vaiyaakaran hue hai
 He was born in Gandhara, then northwest India
 inke vyakaran kaa naam ashtaadhi he jisamen aath adhyay or lagbhag chaar sahasr sutara hai
 Panini's contribution in giving grammatical form to the Sanskrit language is considered incomparable
 ashtaadhi maatr vyakaran granth nahin he
 In this way, a complete picture of the then Indian society is found
 us samay ke bhugol, saamaajik, aarthik, shiksha or raajnneetik jivan, darshanik chintan, khan-paan, rahan-sahan aadi ke prasang sthaan-sthaan par ankit hai
 Panini was born in a village called Shalatur
 jahaan kabul nadi sindhu main mili he us sangam se kuch mile dur yah gaanv tha
 He is now called Lahur
 apane janmasthan ke anusaar panini shalaaturiya bhi kahe gaye hai
 And he himself mentions this name in the Ashtadhyayi
 chini yatri yuvanchvaan uttar-pashchim se aate samay shalaatur gaanv main gaye the
 Panini's guru's name was the father's name Panin and mother's name was Daakshi
 panini jab bade hue to unhone vyakaranshastra kaa gaharaa adhyayan kiya
 There were many masters of vocabulary before Panini
 unke granthon ko padhakar or unke paraspar bhedon ko dekhakar panini ke man main vah vichaar aayaa ki unhen vyakaranshastra ko vyavasthit karnaa chahie
 Earlier, before Panini, the Vedic codes, branches, Brahmins, Aranyakas, Upanishads, etc
, which had expanded, they took the word for themselves from the word which they have used in the Ashtadhyayi
 duusare nirukt or vyakaran kii jo saamagree pehle se thi uskaa unhone sangrah or sookshm adhyayan kiya
 The proof of this is also in the Ashtadhyayi, as is known by the mention of the opinions of Acharyas like Shaktaayan, Shakalya, Bharadwaja, Gargya, Senak, Apishli, Galab and Sphotayan
 shakatayan nishchit rup se panini se purv ke vaiyaakaran the, jaisaa niruktkaar yask ne likhaa he
 Shaktayan opined that all noun words are formed from metals
 panini ne is mat ko sweekaar kiya kintu is vishay main koi aagrah nahin rakhaa or yah bhi kaha ki bahut se shabd aise bhi hai jo lok kii bolchaal main aa gaye hai or unase dhaatu pratyay kii pakad nahin kii ja sakati
 The third most important thing Panini did was that he saw the world with his own eyes and wandered and got the introduction of the multifaceted life of people and manipulated the words
 is prakaar se kitne hi sahasr shabdon ko unhone ikattha kiya
 By compiling the words, he classified them and made several lists of them
 ek suchi "dhaatu paath" kii thi jise panini ne ashtaadhi se alag rakhaa he
 It contains 1943 metals
 dhatupath main do prakaar kii dhaatuen hai- 1
 jo panini se pehle sahitya main prayukt ho chuki thim or duusari ve jo logon kii bolchaal main unhen mili
 His second list had many Acharyas of Vedas
 kis acharya ke naam se koun sa charan prasiddh hua or usamen padhanevaale chaatr kis naam se prasiddh the or un chand yaa shakhaon ke kya naam the, un sab kii nishpatti bhinn bhinn pratyay lagaakar panini ne di he; jaise ek acharya tittiri the
 His stage was called Taittariya and the students of that school and the branch or samhita there were also called Taittiriya
 panini kii teesri suchi "gotron" ke sambandh main thi
 The original seven gotras used to go from the Vedic era itself
 panini ke kaal tak aate aate unka bahut vistaar ho gaya tha
 Many lists of gotras are in the Srauta Sutras
 jaise bodhayan shrout sutara main jise mahapravar cond kehete hai
 But Panini made a very large list of names of family or family of both Vedic and cosmic languages, which included both the Arasha gotra and the cosmic gotra
 chote mote paariwarik naam yaa allon ko unhone gotravyav kaha hai
 Panini has given a detailed description of how the names of grandfather, old and uncle etc
 in a gotra or family were kept
 bisiyon sutron ke saath lage hue ganon main gotron ke anek naam panini ke "ganpaath" naamak parishisht granth main hai
 The fourth list of Panini was geographical
 panini kaa janmasthan uttar pashchim main tha, jis pradesh ko ham gandhar kehete hai
 Greek geography writers have written that there were about 500 such villages in the northwest ie Gandhara and Punjab, each of which had a population of about ten millennia
 panini ne un 500 graamon ke vaastavik naam bhi de die hai jinase unke bhugol sambandhi ganon kii suchiyaan bani hai
 The identification of those names of villages and towns is a sincerity question, but if a lot of hard work is done, it is possible that Sunet and Sirsa are two small villages in Punjab called Panini as Sunetra and Sharikshak
 punjab kii anek jatiyon ke naam un gaanvon ke anusaar the jahaan vah jati nivas karti thi yaa jahaan se uske purvaj aae the
 In this way, the surnames that were made from both the residence and the elite were added to the male name because such names were also part of the language
 panini ne punjab ke madhyabhaag main khadey hokar apni drushti purv or pashchim kii ore daudai
 He saw two mountainous areas
 purv kii ore kullu kongdaan jise us samay trigart kehete the, pashchimi ore kaa pahari pradesh vah tha jo gandhar kii purvi rajdhani takshashila se pashchimi rajdhani pushkalavati tak failaa tha
 In this, it was the region now known as the tribal region and was spread from north to south of the Indus River and at the northern end was Dard and at the southern end was Saubir
 panini ne is pradesh main rahanevaale kabeelon kii vistrut suchi banaai or samvidhanon kaa adhyayan kiya
 This region was called the rural area at that time because in these tribes, as it is today and still at that time, Gramani was the practice of governance and the word Gramani was the title of their leader or ruler
 in jatiyon kii shashansabha ko is samay jirga kehete hai or panini ke yug main use "bratapug", "sangh" yaa "gana" kehete the
 In fact, there was not a single type of rule of all tribes, but they were in different stages of development of union rule
 panini ne vraat or pug in sangyaaon se bataaya he ki inamen se bahut se kabeeley utsedhajivi yaa lutpaat karke jivan bitaate the jo aaj bhi vahaan ke jivan kii sachai he
 At that time all these tribes or castes were Hindus and the names of their overlords were in Sanskrit language such as Devadattak, the ancestor of the clan or the founder was some Devadatta
 ab naam badal gaye hai, kintu baat vahi he jaise isakhel kabeeley kaa purvaj isa naamak koi vyakti tha
 Many of the names of these tribes are found in Panini's Ganpath, such as Afridi and Mohammed whom Panini has called Apriet and Madhumant
 panini kii bhugolic soochiyon main ek suchi janapadon kii he
 In ancient times, our country was sitting in the district lands
 madhya asia kii vankshu nadi ke uparibhaag main sthit kamboj janapad, pashchim main saurashtra kaa kuccha janapad, purab main assam pradesh kaa surmas janapad or dakshin main godavari ke kinare ashmak janapad in chaar khunton ke bich main sara bhubhag janapadon main banta hua tha or logon ke raajnneetik or saamaajik jivan evam bhashaaon kaa janapadiya vikaas sahasron varshon se chalaa aata tha
 Panini explains the etymology of Sahasrona words in the fourth fifth chapters of ashtadhyagi
panini collected the words of his special profession by brahman, kshatriya, sainik, vyapaaree kisaan, rangrej, badhai, rasoie, mochi, gwaale, charvaahe, gadriye, bunakar, kumhaar aadi saikadon peshewar logon se miljulkar panini ne unke vishesh peshey ke shabdon kaa sangrah kiya
 Panini explained which word suffixes
 varnmaala ke swar or vyanjan rup jo akshar he unheen se pratyay banaae gaye
 Just like annual from rain, here the root word is rain, a suffix is attached to it and it means yearly meaning rain related word
 ashtaadhi main tadwiton kaa prakaran rochak he
 Somewhere one is surprised at the subtle scrutiny of Panini, for example, that in the Bangar land on the northern bank of the Vyas river, the names of the paved Baramasi wells were pronounced in a different tone and every year in the Khadar land on the western side of the same The raw wells that were dug had a slightly different tone of names
 yah baat panini ne "udak c bipasha" sutara main kahi he
 Panini has given the life story of cows and bulls in the formulas
 aarthik jivan kaa adhyayan karte hue panini ne un sikkon ko bhi jaanchaa jo bazaaron main chalate the
 Such as "shataman", "karshapana", "suvarna", "andha", "paad", "mashaka" "trinshatk", "winshatik"
 kuch log ablaa badali se bhi maal bechate the
 He was called "niman"
 panini ke kaal main shiksha or vaanmay kaa bahut vistaar tha
 He had studied Sanskrit very deeply
 vaidic or loukik donon bhashaaon se ve purnataya parichit the
 With his material, Panini composed his grammar, but kept the predominance of secular Sanskrit
 bolchaal kii loukik sanskrit ko unhone bhashaa kaha he
 He not only did scripture but also did teaching work
 
 Panini's educational relationship is possible from the University of Taxila
 kaha jaataa he, jab ve apni saamagree kaa sangrah kar chuke to unhone kuch samay tak ekantavaas kiya or ashtaadhi kii rachana kii
 There are many opinions about what was the time of Panini
 koi unhen 7veen shatee i
 pus
, koi 5veen shatee yaa chauthi shatee i
 pus
 kaa kehete hai
 Patanjali has written that Panini's Ashtadhyayi was not related to any one Veda but to the councils of all Vedas
 panini ke granthon kii sarvasammat pratishtha kaa yah bhi kaaran hua
 Panini was not partial to any particular opinion
 shabd kaa arth ek vyakti he yaa jati, is vishay main unhone donon pakshon ko mana he
 The word cow is also a sign of cow and also of cow
 vaajapyayan or vyadi naamak do aacharyon main bhinn maton kaa aagrah yaa, par panini ne saralata se donon ko sweekaar kar liya
 a famous grammar before Panini was that of Indra
 usamen shabdon kaa praathikanthik yaa pratipadik vichaar kiya gaya tha
 The same tradition was taken in the grammar of Bharadwaj Acharya before Panini
 panini ne usapar vichaar kiya
 He took many technical nouns from him, such as pronouns, avyayas, and made many new ones, like ti, ghu, bhi etc
 panini ko mangalik acharya kaha gaya he
 The generous instinct of his heart was to aspire to manly deeds and fruits
 isaki sakshi yah he ki unhone apane shabdanushasan kaa aarambh "vruddh" shabd se kiya
 Some scholars say that Panini's treatise contains not only the primitive but also the middle and antimal
 unka antim sutara a aa he
 Harsvaraka is the origin of varna symposium
 panini ko suhridbhoot acharya arthath sabake mitra evam pramanbhoot acharya bhi kaha he
 Pantjali says that the formula which Panini once wrote did not cut it
 vyakaran main unke prayek akshar kaa pramaan mana jaataa he
 The words disciple, guru, folk and Vedas Dhatuli and the native word which the Acharya saw, watered him with juice
 aaj bhi panini "shabd:loke prakashte", arthath unka naam sarvatra prakashit he
 Ur inkaa samaykaal anishchit tathaa vivaadit he
 It is certain that they must have existed after the sixth century BC and before the fourth century BC
 aisa mana jaataa he ki inkaa janm punjab ke shalaatula main hua tha jo aadhunik peshawar ke kareeb he
 Their lifespan is believed to be 520–460 BC
 panini ke jeevankaal ko maapne ke liye yavanani shabd ke uddhran kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 It is interpreted by the Greek woman or the Greek script
 gandhar main yawano ke bare main pratyaksh jaankaree sikandar ke akraman ke pehle nahin thi
 Alexander came to India around 330 BC
 par aisa ho saktaa he ki panini ko farsi yon ke jariye yawanon kii jaankaree hogi or panini daara pratham ke kaal main bhi ho sakate hai
 According to Plutarch, when Alexander came to India, there were already some Greek settlements here
 aisa mana jaataa he ki panini ne likhane ke liye kisi na kisi madhyam kaa prayog kiya hoga kyonki unke dwaara prayukt shabd ati clisht the tathaa bina likhe unka vishleshan sambhav nahin lagata he
 Many say that he used the memory of his disciples as his writing book
 bharat main lipi kaa pun: prayog 6thi sadi isa purv main hua or brahmi lipi kaa pratham prayog dakshin bharat ke tamilnadu main hua jo uttar pashchim bharat ke gandhar se dur tha
 Gandhara had Persian rule in the 6th century BC and it is possible that they may have used the Armaic characters
 panini kaa sanskrit vyakaran chaar bhaagon main he - Patanjali wrote his commentary on the Ashtadhyayi of Panini named Mahabhashya)
 ek shatabdi se bhi pehle prasiddh german bharatvid maiks mular ne apane science of that main kaha - "I can boldly say that in English or Latin or Greek such concepts are negligible which cannot be expressed by words derived from Sanskrit metals
 iske vipareet meraa vishwaas he ki 2,50,000 shabd sammilit maane jane vaale angrezi shabdkosh kii sampoorn smapda ke spashtikaran hetu vaanchit dhaatuon kii sankhya, uchit simaaon main nunikrut panineey dhaatuon se bhi kam he
 xxrep 4 
 There is no such sentence in English, after careful analysis of the contents of each word from 800 metals and each idea provided by Panini, the 121 fundamental concepts cannot be extracted
 " The style of Panini's sutras is very brief
 ve sutarayug main hi hue the
 The Shrouta Sutra, Dharma Sutra, Grihasthasutra, Pritishakhya Sutra are also in the same style but the flourishing in the Panini Sutras is not elsewhere
 isiliye panini ke sutron ko pratishna sutara kaha gaya he
 Panini divided the varna or alphabet into 14 pratyahara sutras and made 42 pratyahara sutras by ordering them in special order
 panini kii sabase badi visheshta yahi he jisase ve thode sthaan main adhik saamagree bhar sake
 If the letters of Ashtadhyayi are counted, then its 3995 sutras are equal to one thousand verses
 panini ne sankshipt granthrachana kii or bhi kai yuktiyaan nikaalin jaise adhikaar or anuvritti arthath sutara ke ek yaa kai shabdon ko aage ke sutron main le janaa jisase unhen doharaana na pade
 He also made some definitions of meaning
 ek badi vicitra yukti unhone asiddh sutron kii nikaali
 That is, the latter formula disappears the work of the formula before it
 panini kaa yah asiddh niyam unki aisi tantra yukti thi jo sansar ke anya kisi granth main nahin pai jaati

 thos-avasthaa-electraniki kaa upyog karke vidyut shakti kaa parivartan evam niyantran se sambandhit gyaan ko shakti electronic kehete hai
 There have been revolutionary changes in the field of electrical energy due to power electronics
 aaj 10 wat se lekar kai sau megawatt ke motaron ko chalaane ke liye drive uplabdh hai
 Electric power up to 6 GW can be transmitted via high-voltage DC transmission of about 1000 kw
 railgadiyaan, alevator, or crinen sabhi shakti electronic ke dwaara hi aaraam se chal rahe hai
 Power is the only component in connecting renewable energy sources to the electric grid
 yahan tak ki radar pranali bhi shakti electronic par hi nirbhar he
 Although all small electronic components are used in power electronics, the following components are unique identities of power electronics
 shakti electronic ke kshetra main kaary, laghu-sanket-electraniki ke bhi pehle ho chukaa tha
 Electric machines were first used for the control and conversion of electric power
 iske baad mercury arq ractifire kaa prayog hua
 Then came the era of vacuum and gas-filled valves
 san 1957 main esasiaar ke vikaas se shakti electronic main ek nayi disha mili
 Nowadays, the use of switches like SCR, GTO, BJT, MOSFET, IGBT, etc
 is done very efficiently
 is kaaran shakti electronic kaa kshetra bahut vyapak evam mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Electronics is the department of science in which electric power is efficiently converted to the desired voltage, frequency, current by using electron tubes or semiconductor devices performing similar functions
 vastav main baat yah he ki vidyut shakti hame jis rup main main praapt hoti he usee rup main vah bahut kam upyog main laayi jaati he
 For example, an industry receives electric power in the form of 415 volts, 50 Hz AC
 use vidyutlepan karnaa he jiske liye 0 se 20 volt disi chaiye jisamen se shunya se lekar 1200 ampir dhara bahegi
 It is clear that the power we are getting cannot be directly used for this work, rather it will have to be changed
 yah kaam shakti electraniki dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In fact, there are thousands of examples where electric power cannot be used as it is, rather it has to be changed to some other form
 electraneey yuktiyon main se mahatvapurn upyog ye hai : Many of today's most modern devices also cannot be made without electronics, such as radio, television, movies, fluorescence light, public lecture-system, telephone etc
 ye sab yuktiyaan electraniki kii hi dein hai
 Some of the industrial uses of electronics are briefly mentioned below: udyogon main bahudhaa rujukarak upyog main laae jate hai, jinase prayavarti vidyut-dhara nirdisht dhara main badali jaati he
 They are often of one of the following types: adhik shakti ke rujukari main bahukala rujukari paripathon kaa upyog ekkala rujukari paripathon ke upyog kii upeksha anek kaarnon se adhik laabhadaayak hota he
 The first reason is that nowadays electric power is produced and distributed in the form of tri-art-power
 dwitiya kaaran yah he ki bahukala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata ekkala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata kii apeksha adhik sam hoti he
 In the above mentioned high power loan, either the same loan is kept for many moneylenders or many money bankers, whose loan lines are connected, are used

 This generator is driven by a prime mover
 janitr kaa armechar apana utpaadan us motor ko detaa he jisaki chaal kaa niyantran karnaa hota he
 a sight-current generator is driven by this motor; It produces a voltage proportional to its speed
 yadi vah voltata purvanishchit voltata se bhinn hoti he to ek niamak ko sakriy kar detii he
 This regulator brings about such a change in the area of the exciter that the current of the motor falls to a predetermined value
 is niamak main anek naliyon kaa upyog hota he
 Thus with the help of electronics, the speed of the motor can be controlled to a minimum value

 By this method the work is very clean and an open flame is not present
 dhaatuon ko tapt karne ke kii vidhi ko preran-taapan tathaa achaalak vastuon ko tapt karne kii vidhi ko paravidhyut-taapan kehete hai
 Both of these methods require high frequency alternating current
 tapt kii janevaali dhaatu ke tukade ke chaaron ore ek kundali lapetakar usamen prayavarti dhara kaa pravaah karte hai
 The magnetic current generated by the current flows through the air and also through the metal present near the coil
 dhara ke utkraman se syand main bhi parivartan hota he, jiske kaaran dhaatu main voltata prerit ho jaati he
 Due to this voltage, a large amount of vortex current flows in the metal
 tab dhaatu ke pratirodh ke kaaran taap utpann ho jaataa he
 a power of 1,000 kilocycles or more than 1 meg of cycle is required to electrically conduct dielectric materials
 chunki vastu main hokar dhara pravaahit nahin ho sakati, isliye vastu ko ucch voltatawaale dhaatu ke platon ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 Due to the rapid change of the electric field, the changes in the molecule structure of the dielectric object also begin
 anuon ke bich main gharshan hone ke kaaran vastu main sab ore samaan taap utpann ho jaataa he
 By this method, thick sheets of dielectric objects can be heated in a very short time
 dhaatu ke do tukdon main ucch vidyut-dhara pravaahit karne se unako sandhanit kiya ja saktaa he, arthath mashin main ek sandhan parivartak rahata he, jo 220 yaa 440 volt kii vidyut kii do vidyut-dagron ke bich main se 1 se 10 voltmapi main parivartit kar detaa he or saath hi saath ucch vidyuddhara detaa he
 To make a break, it is necessary that the current flows only for a short time

 Cooker cough or whooping cough or whooping cough is a bacterial infection that initially affects the nose and throat
 yah praayah 2 varsh se kam aayu ke bacchon kii shwasan pranali ko prabhavit karata he
 The disease is named on the basis that the person suffering from this disease makes a barking sound while breathing
 yah bordatella partusia kahalaane vaale jeevanu ke kaaran hota he
 This bacterium is spread among individuals by bacteria expelled by respiration
 yah tab hota he jab sankraman yukt vyakti khansate yaa cheenkte hai
 It also spreads due to contact with bodily fluids of persons with infection such as falling of nasal water
 ye lakshan lagbhag 6 saptaah tak rahete hai or ye 3 charnon main vibhajit hote hai - These symptoms include sneezing, watery eyes, runny nose, loss of appetite, loss of energy and coughing during the night
 in lakshanon main lagaataar khansate rahanaa or iske baad bhunkane jaisi aawaaj aana tab jabaki biimaar vyakti saans lene kaa prayaas karata he, aadi shaamil he

 This cooker cough is for younger age patients whose cough lasts for 2 weeks
 kukur khaansee bacchon main hone vaali ek sankramak tathaa khatarnaak beemaari he
 Mainly affects the respiratory system which is a matter of great concern for both developed and developing countries
 bharat jaise vikasshil desh main prayek ek lakh kii aabaadi par 587 bachche prayek varsh is beemaari se grasit hote hai
 The mortality in children is 4
15 percent, which is 10 percent of the whooping cough, half of the children dying within a year
 yah beemaari bordtal partusis naamak sookshmjivi se hoti he
 Most diseases of the infection occur at the age of five, which is more in female children than in male children
 chah maheene se kam umr ke shishuon main is beemaari se mrityu-dar adhik hoti he, haalanki yah beemaari saal ke kisi bhi maah main ho sakati he, kintu jaada tathaa varsha kii ritu main isaki sambhaavna sarvaadhik hoti he
 Now the question arises that how is this disease transmitted from one child to another? Children suffering from this disease have runny nose, sneeze and cough
 naak bahane ke kram main jo taral padaarth nikalataa he, isi ke dwaara beemaari failati he
 In order to leave the nose, mouth and breath during a cough or sneeze, the bacteria spreads to the surroundings and the environment, which causes infection in other children
 yah beemaari mukhyat: bacchon kii praarambhik avasthaa main, jab unke mata-pita ko unki beemaari kaa pataa nahin chalata, khel ke maidan main, ek bichhaavan par sone or ek hi bartan main khaane-pine ke kram main failati he
 It is not the case that the disease develops soon after the infection of germs
 rogaanuon ke akraman ke pashchaat lakshan dikhaai padane main ek se do saptaah kaa samay lag jaataa he
 The bacteria first come into contact with the inner surface of the respiratory tract and stick to the surface, where it starts to grow by getting the proper medium

 After that the disease starts showing its symptoms, which manifest in three parts
 shuru main bachche ke khaansee hoti he tathaa naak se pani bahata he
 Then slowly, the child does not have any problem due to coughing, but gradually it increases as the process of affecting the respiratory system increases continuously
 jaise-jaise shwasan-tantra prabhavit hota he khaansee or khansane kii gati badhati jaati he or ek samay aisa aata he ki khaansee kii vajah se rogi raat ko so nahin paata he
 Previously, who used to have cough only during awakening, now it also happens in sleep, due to which the child wakes up coughing
 yah sthiti do se chaar saptaah tak bani rahati he
 She then assumes her fierce and fierce appearance
 ab pehle kii apeksha or jaldi-jaldi khaansee kaa daura padane lagata he
 During this time a situation occurs that the child starts having difficulty in breathing
 uske baad saans lene ke kram main ek vishesh prakaar kii aawaaj nikalne lagati he, jaise-kisi kute ke rone kii aawaaj
 This sound is due to respiratory tract infection and the opening of the glottis, but that hoop-hoop sound is not always there
 uske baad khaansee ke saath gadhe rang kaa balgam nikalataa he
 One more thing is that when the cough is showing its gruesome form, then immediately after that it vomits and everyone eats and drinks
