 Eventually Ganeshji was forced to obey him
 apane bhakton kaa man rakhane ke liye ve ek durbal gaay kaa rup dhaaran karke rishi gautam ke khet main jaakar rahane lage
 Seeing the cow grazing the crop, the sage took a straw in his hand with great softness and grabbed it to grab it
 un trinon kaa sparsh hote hi vah gaay vahiin marakar gir padi
 Now there was a big cry
 saare brahman ekatra ho go-hatyara kahkar rishi gautam kii bhartsana karne lage
 Rishi Gautam was very surprised and saddened by this incident
 ab un saare brahmanon ne kaha ki tumhen yah ashram chhodkar anyatra kahin dur chale janaa chahie
 Staying close to the cow-killer will also cause us sin
 vivash hokar rishi gautam apni patni ahilya ke saath vahaan se ek kos dur jaakar rahane lage
 But those Brahmins made their stay there too difficult
 ve kehane lage- 'go-hatya ke kaaran tumhen ab veda-paath or yagyadi ke kaary karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin rah gaya
 'sage Gautama prayed to those Brahmins with utmost persuasion that you guys should give me some measure of my atonement and salvation
 tab unhone kaha- 'gautam! tum apane paap ko sarvatra sabko bataate hue teen baar puri prithvi kii parikrama karo
 Then return and fast here for a month

 After this, bathe in Gangaji again and revolve this Brahmagiri 11 times
 phir sau ghadon ke pavitra jal se parthiv shivlingon ko snaan karaane se tumhaara uddhaar hoga
 According to the Brahmins, Maharishi Gautama, after completing all those tasks, became fully engrossed with his wife and started worshiping Lord Shiva
 isse prasann ho bhagwaan shiv ne prakat hokar unase var maangane ko kaha
 Maharishi Gautam said to him- 'lord, i want you to free me from the sin of cow-slaughter
 ' bhagavan shiv ne kaha- 'gautam ! tum sarvatha nishpaap ho
 The crime of cow slaughtering was done fraudulently on you
