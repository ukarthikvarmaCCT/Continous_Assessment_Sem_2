 His research form "mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy" was published in 1687, in which the laws of universal gravitation and motion were explained and thus laid the foundation of sustainable physics
 unki philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica, 1687 main prakashit hui, yah vigyaan ke itihaas main apane aap main sabase prabhaavshaalee pustak he, jo adhikansh saahitiyik yantriki ke liye aadharbhoot kaary kii bhoomika nibhaati he
 In this work, Newton described three laws of universal gravitation and motion that dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries
 newton ne darshaya ki prithvi par vastuon kii gati or akashiya pindon kii gati kaa niyantran prakritik niyamon ke samaan samucchy ke dwaara hota he, ise darshane ke liye unhone grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon tathaa apane gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke bich nirantarata sthapit kii, is prakaar se surya kendriyata or vaigyanik kranti ke aadhunikeekaran ke bare main pichley andeh ko dur kiya
 In mechanics, Newton established the principles of conservation of both momentum and angular momentum

 Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643, old style and new style dates | OS]]: 25 December 1642] in Woolsthorpe Manor in woolsthorpe-by-kolsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire
 newton ke janm ke samay, england ne grigorian calendar ko nahin apanaaya tha or isliye unke janm kii tithi ko christmas diwas 25 disambar1642 ke rup main darj kiya gaya
 Newton was born three months after his father's death, he was a prosperous farmer and his name was Isaac Newton
 purv paripakv avasthaa main paidaa hone vaala vah ek chota balak tha; unki mata hanna askf kaa kahana tha ki vah ek chauthai gaylen jaise chote se mag main samaa saktaa tha
 When Newton was three, her mother remarried and moved to live with her new husband, Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of her grandmother, Margerie Esqf
 The younger Isaac did not like his stepfather
 And had a sense of enmity with his mother for marrying her
 jaisaa ki 19 varsh tak kii aayu main unke dwaara kiye gaye aparaadhon kii suchi main pradarshit hota he: "maine mata or pita smith ke ghar ko jalaane kii dhamkee di
" From the age of twelve to the age of seventeen, he was educated at The King's School, Grantham
 He was expelled from school and in October 1659 he moved to woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth, where his mother, who was widowed for the second time, gave him Insisted on making farmers

 In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar — a kind of work-study role

 But Newton wanted to read the ideas of more modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler
 1665 main unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kii khoj kii or ek ganitiya siddhant viksit karnaa shuru kiya jo baad main atyalp kalan ke naam se janaa gaya
 As soon as Newton received his degree in August 1665, the university was closed as a precaution to avoid the horrific epidemic of plague
 Although he was not distinguished as a Cambridge student, the following two years He studied privately at his home in Woolsthorpe and developed his theories on calculus, optics and the laws of gravity
 1667 main vah trinity ke ek phelo ke rup main cambridge laut aae
 Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed the least calculus independently using their own unique notations
 newton ke aantarik chakra ke anusaar, newton ne apni is vidhi ko libanij se kai saal pehle hi viksit kar diya tha, lekin unhone lagbhag 1693 tak apane kisi bhi kaary ko prakashit nahin kiya or 1704 tak apane kaary kaa puraa lekha jokha nahin diya
 is bich, libanij ne 1684 main apni vidhiyon kaa puraa lekha jokha prakashit karnaa shuru kar diya
 iske alaava, libanij ke sanketanon tathaa "avkalan kii vidhiyon" ko mahadweep par saarvatrik rup se apanaaya gaya or 1820 ke baad, british samrajya main bhi ise apanaaya gaya
 While Leibniz's pamphlets reflect the modernization of ideas from early stages to maturity, Newton's known notes have only the final result
 newton ne kaha ki ve apane kalan ko prakashit nahin karnaa chaahate the kyonki unhen dar tha ve uphaas kaa paatr ban jaayenge
 Newton had a very close relationship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fátio de Duillier, who had been heavily influenced by Newton's theory of gravitation since the beginning
 1691 main duiliar ne newton ke philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica ke ek nae sanskaran ko taiyaar karne kii yojana banaayi, lekin ise kabhi puraa nahin kar paae
baharhaal, in donon purushon ke bich sambandh 1693 main badal gaya
 At this time, Duillier also exchanged several letters with Leibniz
 1699 kii shuruyaat main, royal socity ke anya sadasyon ne libanij par saahitiyik chori ke aarope lagaaye or yah vivaad 1711 main purna rup se saamne aayaa
 a study by the Royal Society of Newton declared that Newton was the true inventor and that Leibniz had committed fraud
 yah adhyayan andeh ke ghere main aa gaya, jab baad paaya gaya ki newton ne khud libanij par adhyayan ke nishkarsh kii tippanee likhi
 Thus began the bitter Newton v
 Leibniz dispute, which continued in the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the death of Leibniz in 1716
 newton ko aam taur par samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jo kisi bhi ghaat ke liye maanya he
 He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, graded cubic plane curves, made significant contributions to the theory of finite differences, he was the first to use fractional indices and the use of coordinate geometry to derive the solution of diophenatin equations
 did
 unhone laghuganak ke dwaara haraatmak shredhi ke aanshik yoga kaa sanniktan kiya, or ve pehle vyakti the jinhone aatmavishvaas ke saath ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa prayog kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa vilom kiya
 In 1669 he was elected a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
 un dinon, cambridge yaa oxford ke kisi bhi sadsy ko ek nirdisht angreji pujari hona aavashyak tha
 However, the Lukesian professor was not required to be active in the church
 newton ne tark diya ki samanvay kii aavashyaktaa se unhen mukt rakhana chahie or charles dwitiya, jisaki anumati anivaary thi, ne is tark ko sweekaar kiya
 Thus a conflict arose between Newton's religious views and the English orthodoxy
 1670 se 1672 tak, newton kaa prakaashiki par vyaakhyaan diya
 is avadhi ke dauraan unhone prakaash ke apvartan kii khoj kii, unhone pradarshit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko rangon ke ek spectrum main viyojit kar detaa he or ek lens or ek doosraa prism bahuvarni spectrum ko sanyojit kar ke shwet prakaash kaa nirmaan karata he
 He also showed that the separation of colored light and shining on different objects does not change the properties of the colored light
 newton ne varnit kiya ki chaahe yah paravartit ho, yaa vikirit ho yaa sancharit ho, yah samaan rang kaa bana rahata he
 Thus, he observed that color is the result of the interaction of an object with already colored light, rather than the objects themselves producing colors
 yah newton ke rang siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 From this work he concluded that, the lens of any refractory telescope would experience diffusion in the colors of light, and to prove this concept, he constructed a telescope, using a mirror as an object, so that The problem can be solved
 Indeed, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involves shaping technology and solving the problem of an appropriate mirror material, according to the design of the design
 newton ne atyadhik paravartak veekshak dhaatu ke ek custom sanghathan se, apane darpan ko aadhaar diya, iske liye unke doordarshee hetu prakaashiki ki gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye newton ke chhallon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 By February 1669 he was able to produce an instrument without chromatic aberration
 1671 main royal socity ne unhen unke paravarti doordarshee ko prardashit karne ke liye kaha
 His interest encouraged him to publish his observations on color, which he later elaborated on as his optics
 jab robert hook ne newton ke kuch vichaaron kii aalochana kii, newton itnaa naaraaz hue ki ve saarvajanik bahes se baahar ho gaye
 Both remained enemies until Hook's death
 newton ne tark diya ki prakaash kanon yaa atisuksham kanon se bana he, jo saghan madhyam kii or jate samay apavartit ho jate hai, lekin prakaash ke vivartan ko spasht karne ke liye ise tarangon ke saath sambandhit karnaa jaruri tha
 
 Later physicists supported a pure wave-like explanation for the diffraction of light
 aaj kii kwantem yantriki, photone or tarang-kan yugmata ke vichaar, newton kii prakaash ke bare main samaj ke saath bahut kam samanta rakhte hai
 In his vision of light in 1675, Newton approved the presence of ether to transfer forces between particles
 brahm vidyavadi henry mor ke sampark main aane se rasayan vidya main unki ruchi punerjeevit ho gayi
 They replaced ether with occult forces based on airborne ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles
 John Maynard Keynes, who accepted many of Newton's writings on alchemy, states that "newton was not the first of the era of reason: he was the last of the magicians
 " rasayan vidya main newton kii ruchi unke vigyaan main yogadan se alag nahin kii ja sakati he
 If he had not relied on the secret idea of action at a distance through a vacuum, he would not have developed his theory of gravity
 1704 main newton ne optics ko prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone apane prakaash ke atisookshm kanon ke siddhant kii vistaar se vyakhya kii
unhone prakaash ko bahut hi sookshm kanon se bana hua mana, jabaki saadhaaran dravya bade kanon se bana hota he or unhone kaha ki ek prakaar ke rasinic roopantaran ke madhyam se "sakal nikaay or prakaash ek duusare main roopantarit nahin ho sakate hai, xxrep 7 
 or nikaay, prakaash ke kanon se apni gatividhi ke adhikansh bhaag ko praapt nahin kar sakate, jo unke sanghathan main pravesh karti he?" newton ne ek kaanch ke globe kaa prayog karte hue, ek gharshan vidyut sthitik janarator ke ek aadya rup kaa nirmaan kiya
 In 1677, Newton again began his work on mechanics, that is, with reference to Kepler's laws of gravity and planetary motion, the effect of gravity on the orbit of the planets and Hook and Flemsteed's consultation on the subject
 unhone jiram main di motu corporam main apane parinaamon kaa prakaashan kiya
 It was the introduction of the laws of motion that informed the Principia
 philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica kaa prakaashan edmund heli kii vittiya madad or protsaahan se 5 july 1687 ko hua
 In this work Newton gave three universal laws of motion in which no improvement has been made for more than 200 years

 With the Principia, Newton gained international fame
 He received much acclaim, being an admirer of his, Switzerland-born Nicolas Fatio de Daulier, with whom he had a deep relationship, which ended in 1693 when Newton suffered from nerve blockages
 1690 ke dashak main, newton ne kai dharmik shodh likhe jo bible kii saahitiyik vyakhya se sambandhit the
 Henry More's belief in the universe and his rejection of Cartesian dualism probably influenced Newton's religious views

 Subsequent works - The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended and Observations on the Professions of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St
 John - were published after his death
 unhone rasayan vidya ke liye bhi apana bahut adhik samay diya 
 Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701
 But according to some details his comments were always about a cold drought in the vault and he requested to close the window

 Newton himself was hesitant to state his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants Although historians generally believe that the above lines were an attack on Hook, other than - or rather than - a statement made with humility
 At that time there was a dispute between the two about the optical discoveries

 iske liye libanij Condemned him: "almighty God wants to end his watch from time to time: otherwise it will be stopped to move

 Thus, the clarity and ingenuity of science were seen as a way to counter the emotional and spiritual exaggeration of both the threat of atheism and superstitious zeal, and at the same time, a second wave of English divinity led to Newton's discoveries
 Used to demonstrate the possibility of a "natural religion"
 purv-atmagyaan ke khilaaf kiye gaye hamale "jaadui soch," or isaiyat ke rahasyamayi tatv, ko brahmand ke bare main boyal kii yantric avadharana se neenv mili

 His spokesman, Clarke, disapproved of Leibniz's theology, which freed God from the responsibility of "l'origine du mal", removing God from contributing to his creation, as Clarke said
 Was such a deity would be king by name only, but would be one step away from atheism
 But the undiscovered theological result of the success of Newton's system in the next century would reinforce the position of theism revealed by Leibniz
 duniya ke bare main samaj ab saadhaaran maanav ke kaaran ke str tak aa gayi or maanav, jaisaa ki odo mercward ne tark diya, buraai ke sudhaar or unmoolan ke liye uttaradaayi ban gaya
 On the other hand, the results of the ideas of the Late Latinian and Newtonian were far-reaching, a religious faction devoted to the concept of the mechanical universe, but with the same zeal and mystery that the Enlightenment struggled hard to destroy
 ek pandulipi jo unhone 1704 main likhi, jisame unhone bible se vaigyanik jaankaree nikaalane ke apane prayaas kaa varnan kiya he, unka anumaan tha ki duniya 2060 se pehle samaapt nahin hogi
 In this prophecy, he said, "it does not say what the final time will be, but i want to stop speculation about imaginary individuals who often make predictions about the end times and fail this prediction
" Holy prophecy is discredited upon leaving
 " Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of earlier scientists — Galileo, Boyle, and primarily Newton — as guiding and guaranteeing their application of the single concept of natural law and nature to every physical and social field of election day
 Gone

 Monbodo and Samuel Clarke opposed elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalized it to ensure his strong religious views about nature
 shahi taksaal ke prabandhak ke rup main, newton ne anumaan lagaaya ki dubaara dhalaai kiye jane vaale sikkon main 20% jaali the
 Fraud was a very high treason for which there was a death sentence

 Newton won his commitment and in February 1699 he had ten prisoners awaiting release
 raja ke vakil ke rup main newton kaa ek maamla wiliam chaloner ke khilaaf tha
 Chaloner's plan was to set up a fake conspiracy of Catholics and then turn them into hapless conspirators whom he held hostage
 chaloner ne apane aap ko paryaapt samrudh sajjan bana liya
 While applying in Parliament, the Chaloner also provided equipment for making fake coins in the mint
 He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the mint processes so that he could do something to improve it
 usne sansad main arji di ki sikkon kii dhalaai ke liye uski yojana ko sweekaar kar liya jaye taaki jaalsaji na kii ja sake, jabaki usee samay jaali sikke saamne aaye
 Newton tested cheating on Chaloner and in September 1697 sent him to New Gate Prison

 Newton tested it for the second time with conclusive evidence

 According to Newton's first law, an object which is in steady state will remain constant and an object which is in the same state of motion will move in the same direction with the same speed until an external force acts on it
 newton ke duusare niyam ke anusaar ek vastu par lagaaya gaya bal f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec{, samay ke saath iske samveg p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec{ main parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 In mathematical terms it can be expressed as follows chunki doosraa niyam ek sthir dravyaman kii vastu par lagu hota he,, pehla pad lupt ho jaataa he or twaran kii paribhaasha kaa upyog karte hue pratisthaapan ke dwaara sameekaran ko sanketon ke rup main nimnanusaar likhaa ja saktaa he The first and second laws represent the breaking of Aristotle's physics, in which it was believed that a force was necessary to maintain motion
 ve rajya main vyavastha kii gati kaa ek uddeshy he rajya badalane ke liye hai ki ek hi shakti kii jarurat he
 The SI unit of force is named Newton in honor of Newton
 newton ke tisare niyam ke anusaar prayek kriya kii baraabar or vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object then the second object exerts the same force on the first object in the opposite direction
 iskaa ek saamaanya udahaaran he do aais skates ek duusare ke vipareet khiskate hai to vipareet dishaao main khisakane lagate hai
 Another example is the backward thrust of the gun, in which the force exerted by the gun to fire the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun which the gunner feels
 chunki prashn main jo vasteen hai, aisa jaruri nahin ki unka dravyaman baraabar ho, isliye donon vastuon kaa parinami twaran alag ho saktaa he 
 Unlike Aristotle, Newton's physics has become universal
 udhaaharan ke liye, doosraa niyam grahon tathaa ek girte hue pathar par bhi lagu hota he
 The vector nature of the second law establishes a geometric relationship between the direction of force and the type of change in momentum of the object
 newton se pehle, aam taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki surya ke chaaron or ghurnan kar rahe ek grah ke liye ek agragami bal aavashyak hota he jisaki vajah se yah gati karata rahata he
 Newton showed that instead of this, an attraction force inside the Sun is required
 yahan tak ki princepia ke prakaashan ke kai dashakon ke baad bhi, yah vichaar saarvatrik rup se sweekrut nahin kiya gaya
 And many scientists preferred Descartes's theory of Vorticas
 newton aksar khud ek kahani kehete the ki ek ped se ek girte hue seb ko dekh kar ve gurutvkarshan kaa siddhant banane ke liye prerit ho paae
 Later cartoons were made to satirize where the apple was seen falling on Newton's head and it was demonstrated that its influence somehow introduced Newton to the force of gravity
 His booklets showed that in the late 1660s Newton's idea that terrestrial gravity expanded, it was inversely proportional to the square of the moon; However, it took him two decades to develop the complete theory
 jon kanadyuit, jo royal taksaal main newton ke sahyogi the or newton kii bhatiji ke pati bhi the, ne is ghatana kaa varnan kiya jab unhone newton ke jivan ke bare main likhaa: In 1666 he retired from Cambridge again and moved to Lincolnshire near his mother
 jab ve ek baag main gum rahe the tab unhen ek vichaar aayaa ki gurutv kii shakti dharti se ek nishchit duuri tak simit nahin he, lekin yah shakti usase kahin zyada aage vistrut ho sakati he jitna ki pehle aam taur par sochaa jaataa tha
 He told himself whether it would be as high as the moon and if so, it would affect his speed and possibly keep it in its orbit, what was the effect of the logic they were calculating
 
 sawaal gurutv ke astitv kaa nahin tha balki yah tha ki kya yah bal itnaa vistrut he ki yah chaand ko apni kaksha main banaaye rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Newton showed that if the force decreases in square inverse of distance, the lunar orbital period can be calculated and a good result can be obtained
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki yahi bal anya kakshiya gati ke liye jimmedaar he or isiilie ise saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa naam de diya
 William Stukele, a contemporary writer, recounts the life of Sir Isaac Newton in his memory, recalling a conversation he had with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, when Newton mentioned that "the idea of gravity in his mind When did it come first? jab vah dhyaan kii mudra main baithe the usee samay ek seb ke girane ke kaaran aisa hua
 Why does this apple always fall perpendicular to the ground? He thought so in himself
 yah bagal main yaa upar kii ore kyon nahin jaataa he, balki hameshaa prithvi ke centre kii ore hi girtaa he
 "in similar terms, Voltaire wrote in an essay on epic poetry," Sir Isaac Newton was wandering in his gardens, looking at an apple falling from a tree, he first thought of the system of gravity
 vibhinn pedo ko "vah" seb ke ped hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he jiskaa newton ne varnan kiya he
 The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, and after a few years it was brought down with roots and planted in the headmaster's garden
 neshnal trust jo woolsthrope menor kaa maalik he, kaa vartmaan staff is par vivaad karata he, ore daawa karata he ki vah ped unke bageeche main upasthit he jis ke bare main newton ne baat kii
 a descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room in which Newton lived while studying
 brogdel main rashtriya falon kaa sangrah un pedo se grapht kii aapurti kar saktaa he, jo flower of kent ke samaan dikhaai detaa he, jo ek mote goode kii pakaane kii kism he

 According to Dinkar Ji's statement, Rahim gave many times more space in his poems than the place Akbar gave to Hinduism in his deen-elahi
 rahim ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki vah dharm se musalmaan or samskruti se shuddh bhartiya the
 After the abolition of Rahim's education, Emperor Akbar, while following the tradition of his father Humayun, got Rahim married to Mahaban, sister of Mirza Aziz Koka, Bairam Khan's adversary
 is vivaah main bhi akbar ne vahi kiya, jo pehle karata rahaa tha ki vivaah ke sambandhon ke badaulat aapasi tanaav va puraani se puraani katutaa ko samaapt kar diya karata tha
 Because of Rahim's wedding Beram Kha and Mirza's ongoing estrangement is finished
 rahim kaa vivaah lagbhag solah saal kii umr main kar diya gaya tha
 One of the principal posts to Akbar's court was the post of Mir Arj
 yah pad paakar koi bhi vyakti raaton raat amir ho jaataa tha, kyonki yah pad aisa tha, jisase pahunchakar hi janata kii fariyaad samraat tak pahunchati thi or samraat ke dwaara liye gaye faisle bhi isi pad ke jariye janata tak pahunchaae jate the

 samraat akbar ne is pad kaa kaam- kaaj sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye apane sachche tathaa vishwaas paatr amir rahim ko mustakil mir arj niyukt kiya
 The whole court was stunned upon hearing this decision
 is pad par asin hone kaa matlab tha ki vah vyakti janata evam samraat donon main saamaanya rup se vishwasaneey he
 After much effort and blessings, Akbar could get a boy, whom he named Salim, with the blessings of Sheikh Salim Chishti
 shahjada saleem maan-baap or duusare logon ke adhik dulaar ke kaaran shiksha ke prati udasin ho gaya tha
 Akbar got many great people engaged in Salim's education
 in mahaan logon main sher ahamed, mir kalaan or darbari vidwaan abulfjal the
 Despite the efforts of all the people, Shahzada Salim did not mind studying
 akbar ne sadaa kii tarah apana aakhri hathiyaar rahim khaane khaanaa ko saleem kaa atali niyukt kiya
 It is said that Rahim was very happy to get this glory
 rahim ne avadhi or brajabhasha donon main hi kavita kii he jo saral, swaabhaavik or pravahpurn he
 In his poetry, there is adornment, calm and humor

 As a result, companies producing bottled water in developing countries are making large sums of money

 bottleband pani kaa upyog karne waalon se jab poocha jaataa he ki ve pani par itnaa adhik paisa kyon kharch karte hai jabaki unhen nal kaa pani aasaani se muft main mil saktaa he? unka kahana he ki ve bottleband pani ko isliye variyata dete hai kyonki vah adhik shuddh or swasthkar hota he

 With his talent and dedication, he not only made amazing innovations in the field of Mathematics but also gave India an incomparable pride
 ye bachapan se hi vilakshan pratibhavan the
 He learned mathematics by himself and compiled 3,884 theorems of mathematics throughout his life
 inamen se adhikansh prameya sahi siddh kiye ja chuke hai
 He drew many fundamental and unconventional results on the strength of the intuitive knowledge of mathematics and the unique talent of algebraic hypothesis, which inspired research to date, although some of his discoveries have not yet been adopted into the mathematics mainstream
 haal main inke sutron ko crystal-vigyaan main prayukt kiya gaya he
 Ramanujan Journal has been established for the work being done in the areas of mathematics affected by his work
 ramanujan kaa janm 22 disambar1887 ko bharat ke dakshini bhubhag main sthit coimbatore ke erod naamake gaanv main hua tha
 He was born in a traditional Brahmin family
 inaki kii mata kaa naam komaltammal or inke pita kaa naam shrinivas ayyangar tha
 His childhood was spent mainly in Kumbakonam, which is known for its ancient temples
 bachapan main ramanujan kaa bauddhik vikaas saamaanya baalkon jaisaa nahin tha
 He did not even learn to speak until he was three years old
 jab itani badi aayu tak jab ramanujan ne bolnaa aarambh nahin kiya to sabko chintaa hui ki kahin yah gunge to nahin hai
 In later years, when he entered school, he never felt in traditional education
 ramanujan ne das varshon kii aayu main primary pariksha main puure jile main sabase adhik ank praapt kiya or aage kii shiksha ke liye toun hiskool pahunche
 Ramanujan loved asking questions
 unke prashn adhyapakon ko kabhi-kabhi bahut atapate lagate the
 Like - who was the first man in the world? What is the distance between earth and clouds? Ramanujan's behavior was very sweet
 inkaa saamaanya se kuch adhik sthool sharir or jigyaasa se chamakati aakhen inhen ek alag hi pahchaan detii thim
 According to their classmates, their behavior was so gentle that no one could get angry with them
 vidhyalay main inaki pratibha ne duusare vidhyaarthiyon or shikshakon par chhap chhodana aarambh kar diya
 He had studied college level mathematics during his school time
 ek baar inke vidhyalay ke pradhanadhyaapak ne yah bhi kaha tha ki vidhyalay main hone vaali parikshaon ke maapdand ramanujan ke liye lagu nahin hote hai
 After passing the high school examination, he received a Subramanian scholarship for scoring good marks in Mathematics and English and also got admission for further college education
 aage ek pareshaani ai
 Ramanujan's love for mathematics had grown so much that he did not pay attention to other subjects
 yahaan tak kii ve itihaas, jeev vigyaan kii kakshaon main bhi ganit ke prashnon ko hal kiya karte the
 As a result, in the eleventh grade examination, he failed in all subjects except mathematics and as a result he stopped getting scholarship
 ek to ghar kii aarthik sthiti kharaab or upar se chaatravrutti bhi nahin mil rahi thi
 This was a very difficult time for Ramanujan
 ghar kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye inhone ganit ke kuch tution tathaa khate-bahi kaa kaam bhi kiya
 Sometime later in 1907 Ramanujan again took the private examination of class XII and failed
 or isi ke saath inke paaramparik shiksha kii itishree ho gai
 The five years after leaving school were very frustrating for him
 bharat is samay paratantraa kii bediyon main jakadaaa tha
 There was severe poverty everywhere
 aise samay main ramanujan ke paas na koi naukari thi or na hi kisi santhaan athwa professor ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka
 His unwavering faith in God and deep reverence for mathematics always inspired him to follow the path of duty
 namgiri devi ramanujan ke parivaar kii isht devi thim
 Unwavering faith in him did not let him stay anywhere and he continued to conduct his research of mathematics even under such adverse circumstances
 is samay ramanujan ko tution se kul paanch rupaye masik milte the or isi main guzaara hota tha
 This life span of Ramanujan was full of grief and sorrow
 inhen hameshaa apane bharan-poshan ke liye or apni shiksha ko jari rakhane ke liye idhar udhar bhatakana padaa or anek logon se asafal yachana bhi kerani padi
 In the year 1908, his parents married him to a girl named Janaki
 vivaah ho jane ke baad ab inke liye sab kuch bhul kar ganit main doobana sambhav nahin tha
 Hence, he came to Madras in search of a job
 barahavin kii pariksha uteern na hone kii vajah se inhen naukari nahin mili or unka swasthya bhi buree tarah gir gaya
 Now on the advice of the doctor, he had to return to his home in Kumbakonam
 beemaari se thik hone ke baad ve waapas madras aae or phir se naukari kii talash shuru kar di
 Whenever he met someone, he used to show him a register of his own
 is register main inke dwaara ganit main kiye gaye saare kaary hote the
 At the same time, at the behest of someone, Ramanujan met Mr
 V
 Ramaswamy Iyer, the deputy collector there
 ayyar ganit ke bahut bade vidwaan the
 Here, Mr
 Iyer recognized the talent of Ramanujan and after asking District Magistrate Mr
 Ramchandra Rao, he also arranged a monthly scholarship of Rs
 25 for him
 is vritti par ramanujan ne madras main ek saal rahete hue apana pratham shodhpatr prakashit kiya
 The title of the research paper was "some properties of Bernoulli numbers" and this research paper was published in Journal of Indian Mathematical Society
 yahaan ek saal puraa hone par inhone madras port trust main clerk kii naukari kii
 Fortunately, there was not much work load in this job and here they used to get enough time for their mathematics
 yahaan par ramanujan raat bhar jaag kar nae-nae ganit ke sutara likhaa karte the or phir thodi der tak aaraam kar ke phir daftar ke liye nikal jate the
 Ramanujan used to write mathematics research on slate
 or baad main use ek register main likh lete the
 At night the sleep of other members of the family was disturbed due to the sound of Ramanujan's slate and pillar
 is samay bhartiya or pashchimi rahan sahan main ek badi duuri thi or is vajah se saamanytah bharatiyon ko angrej vaigyanikon ke saamne apane baton ko prastut karne main kaaphi sankoch hota tha
 The situation here was such that research work could not be carried forward without the help of an English mathematician
 is samay ramanujan ke puraane shubhachintak inke kaam aae or in logon ne ramanujan dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon ko landan ke prasiddh ganitagyon ke paas bheja
 But here they did not get any special help but one benefit was that people had come to know Ramanujan a little bit
 isi samay ramanujan ne apane sankhya siddhant ke kuch sutara professor sheshu ayyar ko dikhaae to unka dhyaan landan ke hi professor hardi kii taraf gaya
 Professor Hardy was one of the world's famous mathematicians of the time
 or apane sakht swabhaav or anushaasan priyata ke kaaran jane jate the
 After reading Professor Hardy's research work, Ramanujan said that he has found the answer to the unanswered question of Professor Hardy
 ab ramanujan kaa professor hardi se patravyavhaar aarambh hua
 From here on, a new era in Ramanujan's life began in which Professor Hardy had a very big role
 duusare shabdon main kaha jaae to jis tarah se ek johari heere kii pahchaan karata he or use taraash kar chamakaa detaa he, ramanujan ke jivan main vaisaa hi kuch sthaan professor hardi kaa he
 Professor Hardy was an admirer of Ramanujan's life and philosophy of life
 ramanujan or professor hardi kii yah mitrataa dono hi ke liye laabhprad siddh hui
 In a way, both of them worked complementary to each other
 professor hardi ne us samay ke vibhinn pratibhashali vyaktiyon ko 100 ke paimaane par aanka tha
 He gave 35 marks to most mathematicians and 60 marks to some specific persons
 lekin unhone ramanujan ko 100 main puure 100 ank die the
 Initially, when Ramanujan sent his research work to Professor Hardy, at first he did not even understand
 jab unhone apane mitra ganitagyon se salaah lee to ve is nishkarsh par pahunche ki ramanujan ganit ke kshetra main ek durlabh vyaktitv he or inke dwaara kiye gaye kaary ko thik se samajhane or usamen aage shodh ke liye unhen england aana chahie
 So he invited Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 kuch vyaktigat kaarnon or dhan kii kami ke kaaran ramanujan ne professor hardi ke cambridge ke aamantran ko asweekaar kar diya
 Professor Hardy was disappointed by this but somehow decided to call Ramanujan there
 isi samay ramanujan ko madras vishvavidhyalay main shodh vritti mil gai thi jisase unka jivan kuch saral ho gaya or unako shodhakarya ke liye puraa samay bhi milane laga tha
 Meanwhile, after a long correspondence, slowly, Professor Hardy agreed Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 professor hardi ke prayaason se ramanujan ko cambridge jane ke liye aarthik sahaayta bhi mil gai
 Ramanujan had written over 3000 new sources of mathematics in his notebook before leaving for England
 ramanujan ne landan kii dharti par kadam rakhaa
 Professor Hardy had already arranged for him there, so he did not face any particular problem
 england main ramanujan ko bas thodi pareshaani thi or iskaa kaaran tha unka sharmila, shant swabhaav or shuddh satvik jeevancharya
 Throughout his stay in England, he mostly cooked his own food
 england kii is yatra se unke jivan main krantikari parivartan aayaa
 He, along with Professor Hardy, published high-quality research papers
 apane ek vishesh shodh ke kaaran inhen cambridge vishvavidhyalay dwaara bi
e
 kii oopaadhi bhi mili
 But the climate and living style there was not very favorable to him and his health started deteriorating
 doctoron ne ise kshay rog bataaya
 At that time there was no tuberculosis medicine and the patient had to stay in the sanatorium
 ramanujan ko bhi kuch dinon tak vahaan rahanaa padaa
 Even at this time, he used to make new imaginations in the mathematical formulas
 iske baad vahaan ramanujan ko royal socity kaa phelo namit kiya gaya
 At a time when India was living in slavery, it was a great thing for a black person to get membership of the Royal Society
 royal socity ke puure itihaas main inase kam aayu kaa koi sadsy aaj tak nahin hua he
 His well-wishers celebrated and held gatherings all over India
 royal socity kii sadsyta ke baad yah triniti college kii fellowship paane vaale pehle bhartiya bhi bane
 Now it seemed that everything was going to a very good place
 lekin ramanujan kaa swasthya girtaa ja rahaa tha or ant main doctoron kii salaah par unhen waapas bharat lautnaa padaa
 On coming to India, he got a professor job at Madras University
 or ramanujan adhyaapan or shodh kaary main punah ram gaye
 Even after returning to India, health did not support them and the condition was getting serious
 is beemaari kii dasha main bhi inhone mock theta function par ek ucch stareey shodhpatr likhaa
 This function, propounded by Ramanujan, is used not only in mathematics but also in medical science to understand cancer
 inkaa girtaa swasthya sabake liye chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya or yahaan tak kii ab doctoron ne bhijawab de diya tha
 Finally, the moment of Ramanujan's departure arrived
 26 april1920 ke praatah kaal main ve achet ho gaye or dopaher hote hote unhone praan tyaag die
 At this time Ramanujan's age was only 33 years
 inkaa asamay nidhan ganit jagat ke liye apurnty kshati tha
 Whoever heard the news of Ramanujan's death in the whole country and abroad was shocked
 ramanujan or inke dwaara kiye gaye adhikansh kaary abhi bhi vaigyanikon ke liye abujh paheli bane hue hai
 In his journey to surprise the whole world by taking birth in a very common family, he gave India unprecedented glory
 inkaa unka vah purana register jis par ve apane prameya or sutron ko likhaa karte the 1976 main achaanak triniti college ke pustkaalay main mila
 This register of about one hundred pages remains a puzzle for scientists even today
 is register ko baad main ramanujan kii note book ke naam se janaa gaya
 It has also been published by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai
 ramanujan ke shodhon kii tarah unke ganit main kaam karne kii style bhi vicitra thi
 He sometimes woke up in the middle of the night by writing mathematics formulas on the slate and then falling asleep
 is tarah aisa lagata tha ki ve sapane main bhi ganit ke prashn hal kar rahe hon
 Along with Ramanujan's name, his Kuldevi is also taken
 inhone shunya or anant ko hameshaa dhyaan main rakhaa or iske antarsambandhon ko samajhane ke liye ganit ke sutron kaa sahaara liya
 There was a specialty of Ramanujan's work
 pehle ve ganit kaa koi nayaa sutara yaa prameny pehle likh dete the lekin uski upapatti par utana dhyaan nahin dete the
 When asked about this, he used to say that he received this sutra by the grace of Namagiri Devi
 ramanujan kaa aadhyatm ke prati vishwaas itnaa gaharaa tha ki ve apane ganit ke kshetra main kiye gaye kisi bhi kaary ko aadhyatm kaa hi ek ang maanate the
 He not only believed in religion and spirituality but also presented it logically
 ve kehete the ki "mere liye ganit ke us sutara kaa koi matlab nahin he jisase mujhe aadhyatmik vichaar na milte hon
 " ramanujan ne england main paanch varshon tak mukhyatah sankhya siddhanth ke kshetra main kaam kiya
 Ramanujan gave the following formula - is sutara kii visheshta yah he ki yah ganit ke do sabase prasiddh niyatankon kaa sambandh ek anant satat bhinn ke madhyam se vyakt karata he
 He also gave another formula for pie - 'ramanujan sankhya' us prakritik sankhya ko kehete hai jise do alag-alag prakaar se do sankhyaon ke ghanon ke yoga dwaara nirupit kiya ja saktaa he
 Example - 9 3 + 10 3 = 1 3 + 12 3 = 1729 { \ displaystyle 9 ^ {3} + 10 ^ {3} = 1 ^ {3} + 12 ^ {3} = 1729}
 isi prakaar, Hence Ramanujan numbers are 1729, 4104, 20683, 39312, 40033 etc

 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya sabase mahatvapurn jaivaracinic abhikriyaaon main se ek he
 All the living beings of the world directly or indirectly depend on it
 prakaash sanshveshan karne vaale sajivon ko swaposhi kehete hai
 Light does not participate in the reaction here, rather the presence of light is necessary for this reaction
 is rasinic kriya main carbondioxide ke 6 anuon or jal ke 12 anuon ke bich rasinic kriya hoti he jiske falswaroop glucose ke ek anu, jal ke 6 anu tathaa oksijan ke 6 anu utpann hote hai
 In this activity, the main product is glucose, and oxygen and water are released as a substance
 is pratikriya main utpann jal koshika dwaara avashoshit ho jaataa he or punah jaev-rasinic pratikriyaaon main lag jaataa he
 Free oxygen enters the atmosphere
 is mukt oxigen kaa strot jal ke anu he carbondioxide ke anu nahin
 The reaction converts the sun's radiation energy into chemical energy
 jo glucose ke anuon main sanchit ho jaati he
 In photosynthesis, solar energy of about 100 terawatts per year is tied up as chemical energy into food molecules
 is urja kaa pariman puri maanav sabhyataa ke vaarshik urja kharch se bhi 7 guna adhik he
 This energy is stored here as potential energy
 atah prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ko urja bandhan kii kriya bhi kehete hai
 Thus photosynthetic organisms convert about 10,00,00,00,000 tonnes of carbon into biomass every year
 bahut pracheen kaal se yah gyaat he ki paudhe apana poshan jadon dwaara praapt karte hai
 In 1772, Stephen Helles stated that the leaves of plants take food from the air and light has some important function in this activity
 pristle ne 1772 main pehle bataaya ki is kriya ke dauraan utpann vaayu main mombatti jalaai jaye to yah jalati rahati he
 If a living mouse is placed in the air generated after burning the candle, it dies
 usne 1775 main punah bataaya ki paudhon dwaara din ke samay main nikali gas oxygen hoti he
 After this, the engine house stated in 1779 that green plants consume co2 in sunlight and remove oxygen
 di
 saasuur ne 1804 main bataaya paudhe din or raat shwasan me to oxijan hi lete he par prakaash sanshleshan ke dauran oxijan mukt karte he
 Therefore, oxygen is used throughout the day, but oxygen is made only by photosynthesis with carbon dioxide
 saas ne 1887 main bataaya ki hare paudhon ke co2 grahan karne tathaa o2 nikaalane se paudhon main starch kaa nirmaan hota he
 The process of photosynthesis occurring in green plants is a very important activity for plants and other living beings
 is kriya main paudhe surya ke prakaashiya urja ko rasinic urja main parivartit kar dete hai tathaa CO2 pani jaise saadhaaran padaarthon se jatil carbon yogic carbohydrates ban jate hai
 It is only through these carbohydrates that humans and living beings get food
 is prakaar paudhe prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya dwaara sampoorn praani jagat ke liye bhojan-vyavastha karte hai
 Various crops are grown to obtain carbohydrates, proteins and vitamins etc
 and all these substances are produced by photosynthesis
 rabad, plastic, tel, celulos evam kai aushadhiyaan bhi paudhon main prakaash sanshleshan kriya main utpann hoti he
 Green trees take carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis and remove oxygen, thus purifying the atmosphere
 oxigen sabhi jantuon ko saans lene ke liye ati aavashyak he
 This action is also very important for the protection of the environment
 matsay-paalan ke liye bhi prakaash sanshleshan kaa bahut mahatv he
 When the process of photosynthesis slows down, the amount of carbon dioxide in water increases
 iskaa 5 si0si0 pratilitre se adhik hona matsay paalan hetu hanikaarak he
 Photosynthesis is also helpful in making biofuels
 iske dwaara paudhe saura urja dwaara jaev eendhan kaa utpaadan bhi karte hai
 This biofuel produces a variety of energy sources undergoing various processes
 udhaaharan ke liye pashuon ko chaara, jiske badale hamen gobar praapt hota he, krishi avshesh ke dwaara khaanaa pakaana aadi
 Photosynthesis has great importance in animals other than humans
 maanav apni twachaa main prakaash ke dwaara vitamin di kaa sanshleshan karte hai
 Vitamin d is a fat-soluble chemical, ultraviolet rays are used in its synthesis
 kuch samudri ghonghe apane aahaar ke madhyam se shaiwal aadi paudhon ko grahan karte hai tathaa inamen maujuud chloroplast kaa prayog prakaash-sanshleshan ke liye karte hai
 Photosynthesis and respiration are complementary and opposite to each other
 prakaash-sanshleshan main carbondioxide or jal ke bich rasinic kriya ke falswaroop glucose kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxigen mukt hoti he
 Oxidation of glucose in respiration, in turn, results in water and carbon dioxide
 prakaash-sanshleshan ek rachanaatmak kriya he iske falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main vruddhi hoti he
 Respiration is a nasal activity, which results in a decrease in the dry weight of living organisms
 prakaash-sanshleshan main saurya urja ke prayog se bhojan banataa he, vikiran urja kaa roopaantaran rasinic urja main hota he
 While the oxidation of food in respiration releases energy, the chemical energy stored in the food is used lively in its various functions
 is prakaar ye donon kriyaaye apane kachche maal ke liye ek duusare ke ant padaarthon par nirbhar rahete hue ek duusare kii poorak hoti hai
 Photosynthesis takes place only from green plants and the equation is very simple
 phir bhi yah ek vivadagrast prashn he ki kis prakaar CO2 evam pani jaise saral padaarth, carbohydrates jaise jatil padaarthon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 From time to time, various plant technology experts have expressed different views to understand this activity
 inamen baiyar, willstator tathaa stall tathaa aranon ke mat pramukh hai
 The votes of Baird, Wilsetter and Staal have only historical significance
 inako baad ke pareekshanon main sahi nahin paaya gaya
