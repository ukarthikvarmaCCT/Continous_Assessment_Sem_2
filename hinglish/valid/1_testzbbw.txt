 Greek astrology has eleventh friend sentiment and twelfth trinity
 hindu jyotish main 11vaan aay or barahawaan vyay he
 Other imaginations regarding the planets in the horoscope are based on the mutual relationships of the zodiac and other possible situations by which the symbols presented are consistent with actions occurring on the creatures
 grahon kii swaabhaavik maitri, virodh or tatasthta tathaa taatkaalik vidwesh, sauhardra or sambhaav kii manyataayen janmkundali ke liye aadharshila ke rup main gruhit hai
 Similarly, the seven planets like Sun, soul, mind, power, speech, knowledge, work, grief, and Aries, respectively, are in the order of twelve zodiac signs like Shir, Mukh, Ur heart, Udar, Kati, Vasti, Linga, Uru, Knees, thighs and feet etc
 have been conceived to describe the mental state and physical deformity, signs, etc
 of the creatures
 grahon ke shwet aadi varna, brahman aadi jati, saumy, krur, aadi prakruti kii manyataayen bhi pranivarg ke rup, rang, jati or manovriti ke parichay ke liye hi hai
 Their successful use is well known for the knowledge of stolen goods
 praaniyon ke samast jeevankaal ke bhinn-bhinn avyav bhinn-bhinn roopon main prabhavit batalaanevaale grahon kii dashaon or antardashaon ke parinaam hai
 Which time in life will be pleasing and which will be unpleasant, when will be destiny, when will the happiness of mother, father, brothers, offspring, women etc
, when will marriage happen, which planet will bring prosperity in life and which planet In the state of time, we will have to dig at every rate, most of all at which time you will have to leave this world forever, etc
 All things are communicated only by the planets' conditions and intuitions
 grah dasha kii gananaa ke liye janmakalasambandhi chandramaa kaa nakshatra pradhan he
 Calculated from the Kritika, the positions of the Sun, Moon, Bhum, Rahu, Guru, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu and Venus respectively in the nine Nakshatras are of the order of 6,10,7,18,16 19,17,7,20 years respectively
 Has been considered as 120 years
 is prakaar krittika se janmakalik chandramaa ke nakshatra tak kii sankhya main 9 kaa bhaag dekar shesh sankhya jis grah kii hogi usee kii dasha janmkaal main maani jaaegi tathaa janm samay or nakshatra ke panchangeey bhoga kaal se grah kii dasha ke janm kaal se pehle vyateet or janm ke baad ke bhoga kaal kaa nirnay karke bhavi faladesh ko prastut kiya jaataa he
 If the planet is in its own house or friend's house in the horoscope or is high, the house of the house it will be in, its fruit will be good and if it is located in the house of the enemy or in the low zodiac sign, it will be bad
 ab prashn uthta he ki sabhi gananaayen to ashvini nakshatra se aarambh kii jaati hai
 Then why planetary mood is calculated from Kritika
 tathy yah he ki hamaara grahadshasambandhi faladesh tab se chalaa aata he jab hamaari nakshatra gananaa krittika se aarambh hoti thi
 Maharishi Garg mentions two independent Nakshatra enumerations in the Vedic period - one Kritikadi and the other Dhanishtadi
 garg vaakya he ki- teshan sarveshan nakshatrana karmsu krittika prathammachachakshate shravishthatu sankhyayaa: purva lagnanam arthath sabhi nakshatron main agnyadhan aadi karmon main krittika kii gananaa pratham kahi jaati he kintu dhanishtha kshitij main laganevaale nakshatron main pratham he
 The secret is that at the time when the Tarapanja of Kritika was in the equator, Kritikadi Nakshatra calculation started
 jab uttarayan kaa aarambh dhanishtha par hota tha dhanishthadi gananaa kaa aarambh hua
 It is written in the Taittiriya Brahmana that Mukhna va etanakshananam yatakrittika etah va orienti diyo na chyvante i
e
 kritika is the first of all the nakshatras
 yah udai kaal main purv disha se nahin hatati
 It is certain that the planet or constellation that is in the equinox is the same rises everywhere on the earth plane in the east
 krittika kii akashiya sthiti ke anusaar gananaa karne par yah samay lagbhag 5100 varsh purv kaa siddh hota he
 Therefore, our planet's planetary system is so ancient
 hamaari janmkundali kii dasha antardashaon ke kram se prabhavit hokar arab deshavaasiyon ne varshafal kii ek nai pranali prarambh kii jise 'tajik' kehete hai

 vartmaan samay main raashichakr ke baarah bhaag kar janmkundali ke faladesh kii jo pranali prachlit he iskaa ullekh bhaar ke pracheen vaidic sahitya main nahin he
 But Atharva astrology has long since contained the basic elements of this method
 isamen raashichakr ke 27 nakshatron ke nau bhaag karke teen-teen nakshatron kaa ek-ek bhaag mana gaya he
 Among them, the first 'janma Nakshatra', the tenth 'karma Nakshatra' and the nineteenth 'adhan Nakshatra' are considered
 shesh ko kram se sampat, vipat, kshemya, pratvar, sadhak, naidhan, maitra or param maitra mana gaya he, jaise- Among these, Janma, Sampat and Naidhan i
e
 1, 2 and 7, meet the 1st, 2nd and 8th places of the Dwadavaswali horoscope
 atharv jyotish main dasavaan karm nakshatra he
 Even in the modern system, the tenth place is karma
 isse siddh he ki atharv jyotish main nau sthaan vartmaan kundali ke baarah sthanon ke kisi na kisi sthaan main antarbhukt ho jate hai jo mesh aadi sangyaaon ke prachaar main ane ke pehle hi se hamaari faladesh paddati main vidyaman the
 The description of the constellations falling in the east horizon as lagna nakshatra is also described in 3300 year old Vedang astrology
 jaise,- shravishthabhyo gunabhyastan pragvilagnan vinirdishend
 That is, after counting the property three, the constellations in the horizon before the close should be told
 isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki us samay 27 nakshatron main teen teen bhaag karke nakshatra chakra ke nav bhaag kiye gaye the
 The new departments of Atharva astrology harmonize with this
 europea vidwaanon kaa mat he ki nakshatra chakra ke baarah bhaag yaa baarah rashiyaan bharat main baahar se ai
 But in our Vedic literature, twelve parts of the constellation cycle based on the movement of the Sun and 27 parts based on the daily movement of the Moon have already been done
 yadhyapi hamaare puraanon main jis prakaar nakshatron or chandramaa se sambandhit kathaayen hai, usee prakar meshadi raashiyon kii kathaayen nahin hai kintu greek sahitya main hai
 Even then, it is not proven that the zodiac calculation and sentiment came from outside India
 europea vidwaanon kii hi uktiyaan iske vipareet sakshya de rahi hai
 Jacobi states that in the horoscope, the method of giving fruits from the twelfth houses is found in the book of Pharimicus Maternus

 Varahamihira has named his predecessors Maya Yavan, Manittattha, Satya, Vishnugupta etc

 Because in the specific theory existing 500 years before the year, there is an imagery of ascendant and emotions
 bhartiya jyotish main kuch raashiyon or greek naam is baat ke pramaan hai ki unaniyon se hamaara pracheen-sampark tha

 bhartiya janmkundali kii paddati jaanakar unaniyon ne uskaa vistaar avashya kiya or naveen rup main use varahamihir ke samay main bharatiyon ke sammukh prastut kiya
 As a result, Varahamihira also named the names of zodiac signs along with their new methods like Hora, Dreshanka, such as our algebra today spread across Europe by Arabs and returned to India in its own form and became known as New Mathematics

 According to the historian CV Kunjuraman, the two deities called Sittan and Arattana of Buddhist Ezhavas are actually Buddhist siddhan and arhatan of Buddhism
 kuch anya logon kaa kahana he ki ejhava devtaa arattan khud bhagwaan buddha hai
 TK author of The Travancore State Manual
 Velupillai believes that during the Buddhist influence in Kerala, before the arrival of the Tulu Brahmins, "ezhavas were quite prosperous and sovereign"
 However, he also said that there is no possibility that Ezhavas came from Sri Lanka and spread to Kerala; Instead they were mainstream people of munda-dravidian immigrants, to escape the oppression of their political enemies who left Tamil Nadu in the fifth, sixth and seventh centuries

 wali yaa baali ramayana kaa ek paatr he
 He was the elder brother of Sugriva
 vah kiskindha kaa raja tha tathaa indra kaa putr bataaya jaataa he
 Rama, the incarnation of Vishnu, killed him
 haalaanki ramayana kii pustak kiskindhakand ke 67 adhyyon main se adhyay 5 se lekar 26 tak hi wali kaa varnan kiya gaya he, phir bhi ramayana main wali kii ek mukhya bhoomika rahi he, visheshkar uske vadh ko lekar
 An interesting episode exists about the birth of Vali
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki wali indra or arun kaa putr tha
 Indra was the king of the gods and Arun the charioteer of Suryadev
 aisi manyata he ki surya rose saat safed ghodon ke rath main subah aate hai jiskaa sanchaalan arun karata he
 Once upon a time, some sage cursed the sun that he would not be luminous on the earth
 kyonki surya ne iske pashchaat rath kii sawari band kar di atah arun ke paas koi kaam nahin rahaa
 Arun had already wished to go to heaven and see the divine dance of the Apsaras
 usne is avasar kaa laabh uthaakar ek yuvati kaa vesh dhaaran kiya or apsaraon kaa nrity dekhne swarg lok pahunch gaya
 Indra, who was enjoying this dance, saw a young woman like Arun and was fascinated by it
 donon ne samagam kiya or kalantar main arun ne wali ko janm diya
 Wali was raised by Ahilya, wife of Gautam Rishi
 vanar raaj wali Vali was married to Tara, daughter of the monkey Vaidyaraja Sushen
 ek katha ke anusaar samudr manthan ke dauraan chaudaa maniyon main se ek apsaraayen thim
 One of those nymphs was Tara
 wali or sushen donon manthan main devatagan kii madad kar rahe the
 When they saw Tara, both of them vied to make her a wife
 wali tara ke dahini taraf tathaa sushen uske baayin taraf khadey ho gayi
 Then Vishnu decided that at the time of marriage, the girl is her husband on the right side and the father who gives the bride on the left side
 atah wali tara kaa pati tathaa sushen uskaa pita ghoshit kiye gayi
 It is said that Vali received a gold necklace from his father Indra, who was blessed by Brahma with a mantra that by wearing it, whenever he faces his enemy in the battlefield, half of his enemy's power will be depleted and Vali Will be received
 is kaaran se wali lagbhag ajey tha
 There is such an incident in Ramayana that once Vali was going to Sandhyavandan, Narada Muni was going from the sky
 wali ne unka abhivadan kiya to naarad ne bataaya ki vah lanka ja rahe hai jahaan lankapati ravan ne devraj indra ko parrast karne ke upalaksh main bhoj kaa aayojan kiya he
 Narada of a fickle nature - who is omniscient - tried to pinch Vali and said that now only Ravana is the supreme being in the entire universe and all beings, even the gods, give him the title
 wali ne kaha ki ravan ne apane vardaan or apni sena kaa istemaal unako dabaane main kiya he jo nirbal hai lekin main unamem se nahin hoon or aap yah baat ravan ko spasht kar den
 The omniscient Narada told the same thing to Ravana, who got angry on hearing Ravana
 usne apni sena taiyaar karne ke aadesh de daale
 Narada also took a pinch from him that if you take the entire army for a monkey, it will not be appropriate for your honor
 ravan turant maan gaya or apane puspak vimaan main baithkar wali ke paas pahunch gaya
 At that time, Vali was doing evening
 wali kii swarnamayi kanti dekhakar ravan ghabara gaya or wali ke peeche se waar karne kii cheshtaa kii
 Vali was engrossed in his worship of Archana, but still he held him by his tail and pressed his head beside him and roamed the whole world
 usne aisa isliye kiya ki sampurna vishwa ke praani ravan ko is asahaay avasthaa main dekhen or unke man se uskaa bhay nikal jaye
 After this, Ravana accepted his defeat and extended the hand of friendship towards Vali, which Vali accepted
 maaya naamak asur stri ke do putr the — mayavi tathaa dundubhi
 Dundubhi was an Asura as Mahish
 pahaad se mahaan dundubhi ko apane bal par itnaa dambh ho gaya ki usne sagar raaj ko dwandv yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 Though Sagar Raj could finish his arrogance there, but he said that with such a hero he is unable to duel and asked Dundubhi to go to Himwan, the king of the Giris
 dundubhi himavan ke paas gaya to himavan ne bhi usase yuddh karne ke liye manaa kar diya tathaa usase indra ke putr wali ko lalkaarane kaa suzav diya jo ki kiskindha kaa raja tha
 Dundubhi then went to the door of Kishkindha and challenged Vali to a duel
 madamast wali ne pehle to dambhi dundubhi ko samajhane kii koshish kii parantu jab vah nahin mana to wali dwandv ke liye raji ho gaya or dundubhi ko badi saralata se haraakar uskaa vadh kar diya
 After this, Vali bounced off Dundubhi's lifeless body and threw away a plan in one stroke
 sharir se tapakati rakt kii boonden maharishi matang ke ashram main giriin jo ki rishyamook parvat main sthit tha
 The enraged Matang cursed the Vali that if the Vali ever came within the scope of a plan of his Ashram, he would die
 ramayana ke kiskindha kand main yah bhi ullekh aata he ke wali pratidin surya ko jal chadhaane purv tat se pashchim tat or uttar se dakshin taton main jaataa tha
 He used to throw the peaks of the mountains that came in the way and catch them again as if it were a ball
 iske pashchaat bhi jab vah surya vandana karke lautataa tha to use thakaavat nahin hoti thi
 It is said about Vali that if anyone challenged him for a duel, he would be ready immediately
 dundubhi ke bada bhai mayavi kii wali se kisi stri ko lekar badi puraani shatruta thi
 Mayavi came to Kishkindha one night and challenged Vali to a duel
 striyon tathaa shubhachintakon ke manaa karne ke baavjood wali us asur ke peeche bhaaga
 Sugriva was also with him
 bhaagate-bhaagate mayavi zamin ke neeche bani ek kandara main ghus gaya
 Vali also followed him
 jane se pehle usne sugriv ko yah aadesh diya ki jab tak vah mayavi kaa vadh kar lautakar nahin aata, tab tak sugriv us kandara ke muhane par khadaa hokar paharaa de
 After a gap of more than a year, blood came out from the mouth of the cane
 sugriv ne asur kii chitkaar to suni parantu wali kii nahin
 Realizing that his forehead was killed in the battle, Sugriva closed the mouth of that candra with a rock and returned to Kishkindha where he told the news to everyone
 mantriyon ne salaah kar sugriv kaa rajbhishek kar diya
 After some time, Vali appeared and was very angry when he saw his brother-in-law
 sugriv ne use samajhane kaa bharsak praytn kiya parantu wali ne uski ek na suni or sugriv ke rajya tathaa patni rumaa ko hadapkar use desh-nikaala de diya
 Due to fear, Sugriva took refuge in Mount Rishimuk where Vali could not go due to the curse
 yaheen sugriv kaa milaap hanuman ke kaaran ram se hua
 On Rama's assurance that Rama would kill the Vali himself, Sugriva challenged the Vali
 wali lalkaar sunakar baahar aayaa
 There was a fierce battle between the two, but because both brothers had the same face and body composition, Rama did not shoot his arrow due to confusion
 antat wali ne sugriv ko buree tarah parrast karke dur khaded diya
 Frustrated, Sugreev again came to Rama
 ram ne is baar lakshmana se sugriv ke gale main maala pehanaane ko kaha jisase vah dwandv ke dauraan sugriv ko pahchaanane main galati nahin karenge or sugriv se wali ko pun: lalkaarane ko kaha
 Desperate Sugriva again walked towards Kishkindha's gate to dare Vali
 jab wali ne dobaaraa sugriv kii lalkaar suni to uske krodh kaa thikaana na rahaa
 Tara might have realized that Sugriva enjoys Rama's patronage because Sugriva alone does not dare to dare him again
 atah kisi anhoni ke bhay se tara ne wali ko saavdhaan karne kii cheshtaa kii
 He even said that after declaring Sugriva as the crown prince of Kishkindha, he should make a treaty with him
 kintu wali ne is shaq se ki tara sugriv kaa anuchit paksh le rahi he, use dutkaar diya
 But he assured Tara that he would not kill Sugriva and would only teach him a good lesson
 donon bhaaiyon main phir se dwandv shuru hua lekin is baar ram ko donon bhaaiyon ko pahchaanane main koi galati nahin huyi or unhone wali par ped kii oot se baan chalaa diya
 The arrow pierced Vali's heart and he fell down to the ground
 dharti par gire maranasann wali ne ram se kai prashn kiye jinka saar is prakaar he:- In the Ramayana, Valmiki has tried to answer these questions as much as possible, but in the absence of any concrete answer, those who commented on the Ramayana have tried to justify the case in their own way
 ramayana ke bangla roopantaran krittivasi ramayana ke anusaar tara ram ko yah shaap detii he ki agle janm main ram wali ke haathon isi prakaar maare jaayenge kyonki shaayad is ramayana ke rachayita ko yah puraa prakaran hi tarkahin laga ho or is tarah is prakaran kaa samaadhaan kiya ho
 It is mentioned in the Mahanataka and the Ananda Ramayana that in the next life, Vali as the predator kills Krishna - who is the next incarnation of Vishnu - in the illusion of hunting

 The reason which remains fixed before the work and is not superimposed is not called the cause
 keval kaary ke purv main rahane se hi kaarantv nahin haata, kaary ke utpaadan main saakshaatkaar sahyogi bhi ise hona chahie
 Elsewhere, those so-called causes are included, which remain before the origin of the work, but are not necessarily useful in the production of the work
 jaise kumhaar kaa pita athwa mitti dhonevaala gadhaa ghat rup kaary ke prati anyathaasiddh he
 The work-cause-relationship is based on interchangeability
 kaaran ke hone par kaary hota he, kaaran ke na hone par kaary nahin hota
 In nature, often the work-cause-relationship is not clear
 ek kaary ke anek kaaran dikhaai dete hai
 We have to find the real reason out of those many visible causes
 iske liye saavdhaanee ke saath ek-ek dikhaai denevaale kaarnon ko hataakar dekhnaa hoga ki kaary utpann hota he yaa nahin
 If a task is generated then the one that has been removed is not the cause
 jo ant main shesh batch rahata he vahiin vaastavik kaaran mana jaataa he
 It has been assumed that this work has only one reason otherwise the authenticity of the presumption will be lost
 yadi dhooma ke anek kaaran hon to dhooma ke dwaara agni kaa anumaan karnaa galat hoga
 Where many reasons are seen, after analyzing the work, it will be known that many elements of the work originate from many elements of the cause
 is prakaar vahaan bhi kaarivishesh kaa kaaranvishesh se sambandh sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 It is a mistake to assume that a group of functions is generated from a group of factors
 vastav main samooh rup main anek kaaranvishesh samooharup main kaary ko utpann nahin karte
 They are due to different functionalities
 kaary ke purv main niyat rup se rahanaa do tarah kaa ho saktaa he
 The reason remains before the production of the work, but a separation arises from that cause of the work
 kaaran keval naveen kaary ke utpaadan main sahakaari rahata he
 Soil is made from pitcher, so clay is the reason for pitcher and also the potter who gives mud to pot
 kumhaar ke vyapaar ke purv mitti mitti he or ghade ko koi astitv nahin he
 The pot is born with the help of the potter, so the pitcher is a new work which was never there before
 is siddhant ko aarambhvaad kehete hai
 Reason is the initiator of new work, reason does not transform itself into work
 yadhyapi kaary ke utpaadan main mitti, kumhaar, chaak aadi vastuen sahaayak hoti hai parantu ye sab alag-alag kaary nahin hai or na to ye sab sammilit rup main gadaa in sabake sahyog se utpann parantu in sabase vilakshan apurv uplabdhi he
 Organisms are separate entities from components; On the basis of this principle, initialism is enforced
 bhartiya darshan main nyayavaisheshik is siddhant ke samarthak hai
 The relation of cause to work can also be seen from another point of view
 mitti se gadaa banataa he at: gadaa avyakt rup main vidyaman he
 If there is no soil, since the pitcher does not have latent state, the pitcher does not arise
 vastuvishesh kii kaarivishesh ke kaaran ho sakate hai
 If the work is a new entity other than the reason, then an object can arise for some reason
 til kii jagah baaluu se tel nahin nikalataa kyonki prakruti main ek satta kaa niyam kaam kar rahaa he
 Power is born from power
 asat se sat kii utpatti nahin ho sakati—yah prakruti ke niyam se vipareet hoga
 This principle of Samkhya Yoga is called consequentialism
 iske anusaar kaaran kaary ke rup main parinat hota he, at: tatvat: kaaran kaary se pruthak nahin he
 Unlike these two opinions, there is one other opinion which neither considers the cause as the initiator nor the resultant
 kaaran vyaparrahit satta he
 There is no trade for the origin of work in it
 kaaran kutasth tatv he
 But work is produced in spite of embodiment
 kaaran kutasth tatv he
 But in spite of embodiment, work arises because the observer does not see the koothasta in its pure form due to external titles such as ignorance
 jaise bhram kii dasha main rassi kii jagah sarp kaa gyaan hota he, vaise hi kaaran kii jagah kaary dikhaai padataa he
 Therefore, the distinction of causal work is not an elemental distinction
 yah bhed aupchaarik he
 This view, which is accepted in Advaita Vedanta, is called Vivartavada
 aarambhvaad main kaary kaaran pruthak hai, parinamwad main unamem tathvik bhed na hote hue bhi avyakt-vyakt-avasthaa kaa bhed mana jaataa he, parantu vivartvaad main na to unamem tathvik bhed he or na avasthaa kaa
 The distinction of reason is confusing, and the work that is confused with illusion is virtually untrue
 jab tak drushti dooshit he tabhi vah vyaavhaarik dasha main ve donon pruthak dikhaai dete hai
 As soon as the vision is merged, the merger of work and the knowledge of pure form of reason arise
 kaaran kii teen vidhaayen maani gai hai
 Gratitude is the reason in which work arises out of a cohesive relationship
 arthath vah vastu jo kaary ke sharir kaa nirmaan karti he, upadan kahalati he
 Soil pitches or fresh clothes are the cause of the matter
 isi ko samavayi kaaran bhi kehete hai
 Asymptotic reason is the help in the origin of work by staying in a synonymous cause
 taage kaa rang, taage main, jo kapade kaa samavayi kaaran he at: taage kaa rang kapade kaa asamavaayi kaaran kaha jaataa he
 Isomeric cause is matter, but non-causal is a property or action form
 nimitt kaaran samavayi kaaran main gati utpann karata he jisase kaary kii utpatti hoti he
 The potter is the instrument for the pitcher because he builds the pitcher from the grain
 samavayi or asamavaayi se bhinn anyathaasiddhashunya sabhi kaaran nimitt kaaran kahe jate hai
 According to Aristotle, there is also the fourth mode of reason, which is called the sponsor cause
 jis uddeshy se kaary kaa nirmaan hota he vah uddeshy bhi kaary kaa kaaran hota he
 a pitcher is built to hold water, so that purpose is the sponsor cause of the pitcher
 is chauthi vidha kaa nimitt main hi samavesh ho saktaa he
 Initialism's theory about reason gives importance to reason
 kisi uddeshy kii purti ke liye kaary kaa nirmaan hota he, yadi vah uddeshysthit vastuon se purna ho jaae to kaary kii aavashyaktaa hi na rahegi
 Therefore, there is a situation of separate work from the instrument and for its fulfillment, the instrument gives speed to the gratuity
 jeevon ko unke karmfal kaa bhoga karaane ke uddeshy se ishwar sansar kaa nirmaan karata he
 The emphasis of consequentialism is on causal factors
 gati vastu ko di nahin jaati, gati to vastu ke swabhaav keing he
 Therefore, the main reason is not the speed, but the basis of the motion
 apane aap upadan kaary rup main parinat hota he, keval avyaktata ke aavaran ko dur karne ke liye tathaa supt gati ko udbuddha karne ke liye kisi nimitt kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If ephemeralism is not mentioned about the cause, then the subject will remain incomplete
 upadan or nimitt bhav rup hone ke kaaran baudhon ke anusaar kshanik hai

 hastmaithun shaareerik manovigyaan se sambandhit ek saamaanya prakriya kaa naam he jise yon santushti hetu purush ho yaa stri, kabhi na kabhi sabhi karte he
 It is not only the youth but even older people who do it for sex elevation, they realize that they are still capable of sexual activity

 On average, men start masturbating at the age of 12–13, while women start enjoying masturbation during the last phase of Tarunai, but the matter remains so covered and hidden in them that sometimes even in a discussion Can not come

 But now the era has completely changed

 Although there may be variation but not exception
 vibhinn chikitsa paddati se manovaigyanik laabh pahunchaa kar yon kriya ko saamaanya karne ke liye bhi hastmaithun ko swasth prakriya tehraaya gaya he

" " jaisaa krantikari naaraa bhi marathon swasthya ke liye de diya gaya he
 The prostate gland is an organ that contributes fluid to the semen, as can be felt by inserting a finger into the anus of the prostate

 jaise-jaise dhanagar kii voltata shunya se badhaai jaati he, pattic dhara nirvaat naliyon ke samaan in naliyon main bhi badhane lagati he
 However, when the voltage reaches the ionization potential of the gas, ionization occurs by encounter
 pattic dhara apane purna maan par pahunch jaati he or phir pattic voltat ko adhik badhaane kaa usapar koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 This result is shown in Figure 9
 aisa is kaaran hota he ki muthbhed ke dwaara jo dhanatmak aayan paidaa ho jate hai, ve purna rup se antaran aavesh ke prabhaav ko hataa dete hai, tabhi electron dhara par iskaa niyantran samaapt ho jaataa he or purna electron dhara pravaahit hone lagati he
 As already mentioned, this gas bipolar is used in desorption, where more power is required; For example in the power source of the sender
 ye ve gas dwidhruvi hai jinamein pattic or runagra ke bich ek niyantrak grid laga diya jaataa he
 The work of this controller grid is also almost the same as that of vacuum tube grid control, but a large variation is under control of both
 yadi is grid ke vibhav ko rinatmak maan se dhire dhire badhaayaa jaae to yah dekha jayega ki jaise hi uskaa maan us bindu tak aa jaataa he jisapar dhara pravaahan aarambh ho jaataa he, vaise hi dhara ekadam nune se apane purna maan par pravaahit hone lagati he
 As the full current starts flowing, there is no effect of the current on the grid
 uske baad chaahe grid main kitna hi rinatmak vibhav laga diya jaae, pattic dhara kaa pravaahan nahin ruk saktaa
 The flow of the filler current can be prevented by reducing only the filtered voltage to the ionization potential
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jaise hi vidyuddhara pravaahit hoti he, dhan aayan rinatmak, grid ko dhak lete hai or griu ke vibhav kaa koi prabhaav dharapravaahan main nahin rah jaataa

 kuch anya bhashaaon ne bhi mongol lipi ko lekar us par apni lipiyon ko aadhaarit kiya
 a major example of this is the Manchu language whose Manchu script was based on this Mongol script
 iske alaava shibe, oirat or avenki ne bhi apni lipiyaan mongol lipi se banaai
 Before the Mongols, the Naiman people were already using the Uygur script
 san 1204 main naimanon ke saath mongolon ke yuddh kiya or usamen tartar-tonga naam ke ek uigur lekhak ko bandi bana liya jo naiman sarkaar main kar-vasuuli vibhaag chalaane kii zimmedaari rakhata tha
 He made the Mongols aware of the Uygur script
 kuch sainkadon saalon tak lipi main koi parivartan nahin hua, haalanki yah lipi mongol dhvaniyon ko puri tarah dikhne main sakasham nahin thi
 Gradually, the script introduced new characters appropriate to the Mongol language
 mongolon ne puraani lipi ko is nai lipi se alag bataane ke liye use 'uigurgin' kaa naam de diya
 There is a strong emphasis on Buddhism in Mongolia and in the Mongol community of the Inner Mongolia State of China, due to which they have religious connections with Sanskrit and Tibetan languages
 sanskrit or tibeti swaron ko likhane ke liye mongol lipi main kuch anya akshar bhi jode gaye the
 When the Mongolian script was added to Unicode, these special letters were also arranged in it
 unicode main U+1800 se U+18AF tak kii jagah mongol lipi ke liye arakshit he
 The mean solar time of the Royal Greenwich Observatory of London has been considered as the Green mean time

 'bajirao Mastani' is an Indian historical romance film directed and produced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 film maratha samrajya ke peshwa bajirao or uski duusari patni mastaani ke bare main bataati he
 Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone have both played the lead characters, Priyanka Chopra plays Bajirao's first wife and Tanvi Azmi plays Bajirao's mother
 bajirao mastaani 18 disambar 2015 ko release hui he
 Bajirao Mastani film starts with the making of new Peshwa, Bajirao is chosen for this, after which people of all empires celebrate in this happiness
 phir achaanak bundelkhand se mastaani sahaayta ke liye aati he or bajirao ke sainikon se ladakar sidhe bajirao se milti he or unako manaakar bundelkhand le jaati he vahaan wo vahaan par pratidwindeeyon se donon milakar yuddh karte he or vahaan par vijay praapt karte hai
 After this, Bajirao celebrates Holi in Bundelkhand, meanwhile, Bajirao and Mastani fall in love
 duusare din bajirao waapas pune chale jate hai
 Meanwhile, while leaving, Bajirao gives his dagger to Mastani, due to which he gets married to a dagger in Bundelkhand, under this tradition Mastani goes to Pune
 vahaan par wo bajirao kii mata radhabai se milti he
 Radhabai does not want Mastani, because of this she starts hating
 iske baad chimaji appa shanivarwara dikhaate he tathaa isamen adbhut aainamahal bhi dikhaate hai
 When Mastani asks Radha Bai to accept the relationship, she gives it to Ghungroo and says that since now your relationship has been done, from now on you will dance in the festival
 phir satara se chhatrapati sahu kaa bulaava aata he tab bajirao vahaan jate he phir radhabai ek nai chaal chalati he or mastaani ko ghunghru dekar bhej detii he lekin mastaani vahaan pahunchakar ghunghru chhatrapati sahu ke saamne ghunghru rakh detii he is kaaran pant pratinidhi mehafil kaa apmaan maanate he lekin jab chhatrapati sahu ko pataa chalata he ki wo raja chhatrasaal kii beti he to wo inhen waapas jane ke liye kha dete he or bolte he ki tumhen kya chahie tab mastaani bolti he ki maine bajirao se ishq kiya he bajirao chahie
 After this Mastani waits for Bajirao when a storm comes and Bajirao comes there and marries Mastani
 isi bich kashibai ko bhi pataa chal jaataa he or wo bhi naaraaz ho jaati he
 Then Kashibai and Mastani have sons and are named
 kashibai ke putr kaa naam raghunatha rakhte he jabaki mastaani ke putr kaa naam samsher bahadur naam rakh dete hai
 Meanwhile, a fight ensues between Bajirao and Chimaji Appa
 bajirao sabhi se kahata he ki wo saptami ke din mastaani ko shanivarwara laaenge parantu krishnabhat or radhabai ye nahin karne ko kehete hai
 The film is based on Rau, an excellent historical novel by well-known Marathi novelist Nagnath Inamdar
 yah upanyaas marathi hi nahin balki sampurna bhartiya bhashaaon ke saphaltam aitihaasik upanyaason main se ek he
 In this, excellent prolificity has been introduced while protecting both history and historiography
 is upanyaas main swaabhaavik rup se bharpoor naatakeeyata vidyaman he or padhate hue aisa lagata he jaise koi uttam dharawahik dekh rahe hon
 Its descriptive scenes are also engraved on the psyche like movie scenes
 aise upanyaas par aadhaarit hone se film main anek visheshtaayen swaabhaavik rup se aa gayi hai
 This story has shone even further by a proven director like Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 film main paathya rachana se kuch antar aa janaa to swaabhaavik hi rahata he kyonki donon ke madhyam bhinn hote hai, parantu is film main kuch antar jaanboojhkar filmi latakon-jhatkon ke rup main laaye gayi hai, jisase itihaas-bodh ko dhakka pahunchaa he
 In the early scenes, the scene appointing Bajirao as Peshwa is also very good and appropriate, and despite being outside the novel, it is completely consistent with the historicity and sense of history; But the scene in which Kashibai's old friend, whose husband Peshwa is killed due to Bajirao and therefore curses her husband by leaving her ashes there, has made a clear distinction
 upanyaas main kashibai kii kushal gruhinee ke rup main garimamayi upasthiti he, jabaki film main kashibai ko chanchal kishori kii taraf uchhalte dikhalaakar itihaas bodh ko khandit kar diya gaya he
 The filmmaker has also forgotten that the son of Kashibai, who is filming like this, is getting young and he was the main doer of that festival
 yahan kashibai peshwa kii patni na lag kar filmi heroin 'priyanka chopra' hi lagati he
 The carrying of Bajirao by army with the help of Chhatrasal has also become absolutely historic
 dekhne main bahut rochak he, lekin mastaani ke dwaara aisa na to hua tha, na ho saktaa tha
 Even leaving aside such minor scenes, the filmmaker has made two unforgivable mistakes - Srimanta Bajirao Peshwa and Kashibai have been caught at different times
 us yug main or peshwa parivaar main kashibai jaisi stri, jo ek tarah se rani hi thi, yadi naachati hoti to nartkiyon ko vishesh rup se rakhane kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin hoti
 The special thing in that too is that at the time when Kashibai is danced with Mastani in the film, the pain in her foot was increased even more in those days
 mastaani se kashibai kii bhent bhi bilkul bhinn tareeke kii or filmi latakon-jhatkon vaali ho gayi he
 Therefore, for the sake of creative enjoyment with historicity, the above novel has to be read, but the film has done the task of taking the extraordinary love story and great life of Mahan Bajirao Peshwa and Mastani to people outside of Maharashtra as well, for this film The filmmaker definitely deserves thanks
 lagbhag sabhi kalakaaron kaa abhinay bhi jivant evam prashansaneey he, jo film ko baar-baar dekhne ke liye prerit karata he
