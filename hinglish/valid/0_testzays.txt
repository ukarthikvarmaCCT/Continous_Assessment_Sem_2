 However, since the 1950s, the term "realm" has been used in authoritative documents to distinguish states under the British sovereign's rule from other member states of the Commonwealth, even the Queen Elizabeth's coronation This word was also used in the declaration of
 in rajyon ko realm isiilie kaha jaataa he, kyonki ek hi shaasha kii adheen hone ke baavjood ye saare rajya, purnatah saarvbhaumik hai, or ek-dusre se purnah swatantra hai, atah yah 16 desh, ek rajnatik ikai kaa hissaa nahin he, balki 16 alag-alag rajya hai
 Because realm is not a legal word, therefore no official translation of it is also present

 Therefore, in Britain and the Commonwealth territories, this terminology is also used as an epithet for governance or government, or it may be said directly that this is another way of addressing the monarchy itself
 vidhik rup se "rajmukut" ko ek ekvyakti santhaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki vidhanpalika, karypalika tathaa nyaaypalika ke sampurna samucch nyaayik avatar he
 Therefore, in this context the word should not be confused with the actual crown of any royal dress

 The concept of Rajmukut in each Commonwealth region is the same, but divided legal concepts

 Everyone's approval was obtained
 parantu kyonki british adhirat carch of england ke pramukh bhi hote hai, atah catholic vyaktiyon ko singhasana uttaradhikrut karne par roak lagane vaale vidhaan ko yathaast rakhaa gaya he

 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko rajpariwaar kaha jaataa he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 baharhaal, aam taur par un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 The royal family, based on this criteria, included Adhirat, his / her companions, the widow / widower of the former sovereign, the offspring of the eldest son of the prince of Wales, and the siblings or widows of the sons of the former ruler and grandson of his male line

 to bhi, kai atmaaen vishesh rup se prakruti ke sanchaalan se chintit hai tatasth yaa bhi udaar ke rup main kalpana kii jaati hai; europea kisaan keval makai aatma ko darataa he, jab vah apane domen par chalni or makai ko katkar apni sampatti lene se unhen pareshaan karata he; isi prakaar, koi bhi kaaran nahin he ki devataaon ke adhik tuchh vyaktiyon ko irshyaa ke rup main mana janaa chahie, or hamen pataa chalata he ki dayakon ke patara ko andhadhundh or ghaatak nahin hai, jise maanav jati ke adrishy abhibhavakon ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Demons are usually classified as spirits believed to enter into relations with mankind
 jaise shabd main shaamil hai: Excluded souls are imagined as living in another world
 Nevertheless, not necessarily the gods are known spiritually, demons can also be regarded as physical; Vampires for example are sometimes described as human brains intermittently released from the grave to attack people who live during night watches
 malay prayadweep ke tathakthith spectre huntsman ko ek aisa vyakti kaha jaataa he jo apane kute ke saath akaash ko khatkhatata he, jo ki vah prithvi par nahin mil saktaa he, maa kii maa ke saath garbh dhaaran karne vaale purush-hiran ke liye nirantar khoj rahe hai; lekin vah ek jivit vyakti hai; koi bayaan nahin he ki vah kabhi mar gaya, or na hi vah aatma he
 The incubi and succubi of the Middle Ages are sometimes considered spiritual beings; But they were held to give evidence of their physical existence, such as descent
 rakshason main vishwaas kai sadiyon se waapas chalaa jaataa he parsi vishwaas sikhaata he ki 3,333 dushman hai, kuch yuddh, bhukhmaree, beemaari aadi jaisi vishisht andhere jimmedaariyon ke saath
 In Babylon mythology, the seven evil deities were known as shedu, or "storm-demons"
 ve pankhons vaale bul rup main pratinidhitiv karte the, jo rajasi mehalon kii rakshaatmak prajati ke rup main istemaal kiye jane vaale vishaal bail se nikle the, naam "shed" bhi babylonian jaadu sahitya main ek pratibhashali pratibha kaa arth maanata tha
 It was from Chaldea that the name "schedu" came to the Israelites, and so the authors of Tanach applied the word Shashim to some Canaanite goddesses
 unhone "vidhvansak" ke bare main bhi kaha tha jo bhagwaan ke rup main "mixriyon ko maar daalega"
 Xxiv in Second Samuel; 16 and II Chronicles xxi 15 Compare the "angel of the Lord" in the spreading angel, who is the soul, called the "destructive angel"
 paramparaagat rup se, buddha dharm un rakshason ke astitv kii pushti karata he jo paapi ko peedit karte hai or paapon ko peedit karte hai, yaa jo ki unke gyaan ko vifal karne kii koshish karte hai, saath hi maar naamak rakshas ke rup main, "andhere ke rajkumaar" yaa "evil van" sanskrit main sutron kaa kahana he
 Mara's followers are also called Mara, the devil, and are often cited as the cause of the representation of disease or mental blockages
 maar puri tarah se chini vishvadrushti main aatmsaat ho gaya, or mo kaha jaataa tha
 According to Michel Strickman, when the idea of buddhism's imminent decline and fall was already an important component of Buddhism amid the "great consternation of demonic influences" when it arrived in China in the first century A
D
 rakshasi balon ne duniya main baari shakti praapt kii thi samay ke kuch lekhakon ko ek "praarambhik safai" ko lagu karne ke ucch uddeshy kii seva karne ke liye niyukt kiya gaya tha jo ek antim, messianix navinikaran kii taiyaari main maanavtaa ko shuddh or shuddh karegaa
 Medieval Chinese Buddhism was heavily influenced by Indian Buddhism
 bhartiya shaikshanik vigyaan bhi puri tarah se or vyavasthit rup se likhit sroton main varnit he, haalanki buddha dharm ke china main sahastrabdi ke pratyaksh prabhaav ke dauraan, "chini rajnatikta ko sammanjanak rup main maar diya gaya tha," kai bhartiya rakshason ke saath taowadi anushthan granthon main bhi sthaayee sankhyaayein nikalati hai
 In addition, a major Mahayana Buddhism text describes fifty demonic states: the so-called fifty skanda mares, which are deviations from "negative" mirror-like images or true samadhi states
 is sandarbh main rakshason ko baudhon dwaara kuch alokik shaktiyaan rakhane vaale manushya hone ke liye mana jaataa he, jo purv main dharm kaa abhyaas kar sakate the, buddha kii shiksha ho sakati thi, lekin yah abhyaas karne ke kaaran yah galat tareeke se pragyan, sachcha gyaan or karua, ko viksit karne main vifal rahaa karunaa, jo ek prabud jati ke avibhajya gun hai jaise buddha yaa bodhisattva apni aatmcharitt main, 20 veen shatabdi ke ek pramukh tibeti buddha guru tulku urgen rinpoche, da bling splandar, main aise praaniyon ke saath muthbhed kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Therefore, depending on the context, Buddhist demons can refer to both disturbed mind states and actual beings
 chrishchiyan denisology rakshason kaa ek isai drushtikon se adhyayan he yah mukhya rup se bible par aadhaarit he, in granthon kaa udghaatan, shuruaati isai darshanikon or abhivadan, paramparaon or anya manyataon se judi kinvadantiyon ke lekhan
 Throughout Christian history many writers have written about demons for various purposes
 thomas equinas jaise dharamshastriyon ne aise vyavhaaron ke bare main likhaa tha, jinamein isai ko jaagruk hona chahie, hinrik krimar jaisi chudail shikari ne likhaa he ki kaise un logon ke bare main pataa chalata he or unke saath kya karnaa he jinhen ve rakshason main shaamil the
 Some texts, like Solomon's Lesser or Grimoir of Pope Honorius, are written with instructions on how to summon demons in the name of God and are often written by those whom the Church
 in uttararddh granthon main aamtaur par adhik vistrut the, naam, rank, or rakshason kaa varnan vyaktigat rup se or spasht rup se
 Most Christians generally reject these texts as both devilish or bogus
 aadhunik samay main, isaayiyon dwaara kuch shaikshanik granth likhe gaye hai, aamtaur par thomas equinas kii isi tarah kii nason main, duniya main unke prabhaavon ko samajhaate hue or vishwaas kaise kam ho saktaa he yaa unke dwaara nuksaan ko khatm kar saktaa he
 Some Christian writers, such as Jack Chick and John Todd, write with the same intentions as Kramer, leading the demons and their human agents into the world
 ye daawey mukhyadhara ke vichaardhaara se bhatak sakate hai, or isamen aise vishwaas shaamil ho sakate hai jaise isai rock ek saadhan he jiske madhyam se rakshas logon par prabhaav daalate hai
 Not all Christians believe that demons exist in a literal sense
 aisa lagata he ki naye niyam main bhoot bhagane kii bhashaa ek udhaaharan he, jo ek baar aadhunik dinon main mirgee, maansik beemaari aadi ke rup main vargeekrut hone vaale rogon ke upachaar ke varnan ke liye karyrat thi
 The Vedic scriptures include a series of spirits that can be classified as demons
 ye atmaaen praaniyon kii aatma hai jo kuch vishisht paapon ko kar chuke hai ek shuddhikaran ke rup main, unhen punarjanm tak, ek samay ke liye bhautik rup ke bina ghoomane kii ninda kii jaati he
 Creatures that die with imperfect desires or anger are also called "suffocating" until such issues are resolved
 hindu paath atharvaveda ne is tarah kii atmaaon ke swabhaav or nivas kaa vivaran diya he jisamen unhen kaise manaane or unhen niyantrit karnaa shaamil he hindu dharm main aisi jaadooi paramparaayen hai jo aisi atmaaon ko apni boli lagane ke liye niyantrit karne kii koshish karti hai
 The Hindu text Garuda Purana details other types of punishments and judgments given in Hell; It also revealed how neither soul travels the world
 buraai or manapsand praaniyon kaa adhyayan karne vaale vishay ke rup main dharmanirpekshata, iskaa islamic samatuly shettin ke saath vyavhaar karegaa, balki iske bajaay jinn par dhyaan kendrit kiya jaataa he,haalanki manushya ke prati unki ravaiya bhinn ho saktaa he or ve achche or bure ho sakate hai
 Accordingly, theology in Islam does not focus on evil spirits which is contrary to a disposition of good spirits, but rather devils, jinn, angels and invisible beings, including many supernatural beings present in Islamic folklore with no meaning in Islamic theology
 All types are related
 islam ne purv islamic jeevwad se jinn kii avadharana ko ekikrut kiya, lekin purv divya jinn kii sthiti manushyon ke saath kam kar di or un chizon ko banaaya, jo dharti ko insaanon ke saath saajha karte hai or nyaay kaa nyaay karenge
 Accordingly, the jinn's society is like that of humans, and religion is believed to create, eat, sleep, die and practice
 manushyon ke saath unki samanta ke kaaran, kai kathaayen hai, ki insaan or jinn main yon sambandh ho sakate hai or kuch kanoonee kitaab bhi in alag-alag praaniyon ke bich ek shaadi kii sthitiyon se nipat sakati he
 Nevertheless, Islam forbade dialogue with the jinn
 jin bhi manushya ke kabje or nuksaan kaa kaaran ban saktaa he, lekin jinn ke hamalon ko buraai prakruti ke bajaay apane swayan ke iraade ke parinaam ke rup main mana jaataa he, haalanki ek vyakti jinni shaayad buraai he, lekin uske baad apane nirnay ke kaaran jin yaa to ek madhyasth kshetra main rahete hai, divya duniya or bhautik vimaan ke bich, greek demen or pracheen rome jin jaise yaa prithvi par gum rahe hai, maanav aankhon ke liye adrishy he
 The concept of Satanoon in Islam is similar to Christian concepts of demons and was probably introduced by Islam to angels for Arabic knowledge
 ve iblis ke das banate hai, jo isai vichaaron kii tarah swarg se nirvasit the
 If the Devil himself is originally an Angel or a Genie controversial in the Islamic faith, yet after his fall, he turns into a devil and then Shayten is born
 shettin aakhri din tak maranaa nahin he or vishwaas nahin ho saktaa he, isliye ve hameshaa buraai kar rahe hai, dil se fusfusaate hue, bhagwaan se bhatakane vaale pramukhon kii talash main
 Also, the terms devil and jinn may overlap, because an evil genie is also called a devil, just as evil humans can also be called devils if they are considered purely evil
 islam main swargadoot swarg main hai, jo ishwar dwaara praapt vishisht kaaryon ko puraa karte hai
 They have no desire for the world of nature, so they do not eat, drink, or produce, but they can take on the shape of humans during their visits to Earth
 sabase nirvaachit swargadoot jabarat main rahete hai nichle swargadoot neeche sthit kshetra main rahete hai, vahaan ve manushyon dwaara sapane or sapanom main saamana kar sakate hai, anya bhi narak ko niyantrit kar sakate hai
 a connection between God and heavenly beings, as is done in pre-islamic Arabia, is denied
 islam main, bhagwaan kisi bhi aadhyatmik, ashubh yaa shaareerik sanstha ke baraabar nahin he
 Some scholars state that the origins of the Jewish Rebellion can be traced to two specific and often competing myths ‚Äî evil ‚Äî Adamic and Anoic, one of which is due to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden
 Was associated with the fall of man
 andedulvian kaal main swargdooton ke patan is prakaar, aadmik kahani shaitan ke aparaadh or manushya ke patan ke liye buraai ke strot kaa pataa lagaati he, aadam or eve kii kitabon main ek pravriti ko darshaya gaya he jo shaitan kii nidarta ke kaaran nav nirmit adam ko samarpit karne ke liye bhagwaan ke aadesh kaa paalan karne se inkaar kar rahaa he
 In contrast, the early Enochic tradition based its understanding of the origin of demons on the story of the fallen people led by Azazel
 vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki in do rahasypurna aankade - aazazel or shaitan ne shuruaati yahudee dharmavigyaan par praarambhik prabhaav kaa prayog kiya
 At the beginning of their ideological journeys, while Azazel and Satan are identified as representatives of two distinct and often rival tendencies associated with specific etiologies of corruption, later in Jewish and Christian academic knowledge both enemies find relevant stories of each other in the new conceptual Capable of entering capacity
 in baad kii paramparaon main, satnel aksar gir swargdooton ke netaa ke rup main darshaya jaataa he jabaki unke vaicharik pratidwandvi aazazel ko aadam or hawwa ke pralobhak ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he
 While historical Judaism never "officially" recognizes a rigid doctrine about demons, many scholars believe that later axiom concepts of eschatology, denialology, and demonology were influenced by Zoroastrianism
 haalanki, kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki in avadharanaon ko kababwaadi parampara ke bhaag ke rup main praapt kiya gaya tha
 Although many people today believe that Lucifer and Satan are different names for the same, not all scholars subscribe to this view
 shaitan ke liye naam "lucifer" kaa prayog yashayah 14: 3-20 ke ek vishesh vyakhya se utpann hota he, jo kisi girte hue doot kii baat nahin karata balki ek vishesh babylonian raja kii haar kii baat karata he, jise vah ek sheershak detaa he ingit karata he ki angreji main de star yaa morning star kaha jaataa he
 2 Peter 1:19 and elsewhere, the Latin word lucifer is used to refer to the Morning Star, in which the devil has no connection
 yah keval-nae niyam ke baad ke samay main he jab latin shabd lucifer ko shaitan ke naam ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa tha, donon dharmik lekhan or upanyaas main, visheshkar jab swarg se uske patan se pehle unka zikr karte the
 There are more than one instance where demons are said to come, as do the sins of the watchmen and the Grigori angels, except Lilith's Adam, like demons as vampires, unclean spirits in Jewish folklore such as the diabbuk, and the wicked
 Even humans have become monsters shaitanavaad ek aise dharm ke vibhinn samooh ke liye ek naam he, jo rakshason ke bare main saamaanya rup se or shaitan ko vishesh rup se sakaaratmak sansthaaon ke rup main maanate hai, yaa to vaastavik sansthaaon ke rup main, yaa shaitan or anya rakshason kaa prayog pratikon ke rup main karte hai
 In the Parsi tradition, Ahira Mazda, as the power of the good spenta menu, would eventually triumph in a cosmic battle known as the Angra menu or Ahiran

 : 125, 141, 153 There are four main elements of this dance - toprock, downrock, Power Move and Freeze / Suicide
 The dance is performed with both hip-hop and other genres of music - to prolong musical breaks that are remixed
 bi-bowing ke liye sangeet kaa chunaav keval hip-hop sangeet tak hi simit nahin he, balki yah sur or taal kii sharton ke puraa hone tak aage badhata jaataa he
 Performers practicing this dance are referred to as b-boy, b-girl or Breaker

 Although street dance has been used frequently, "b-boying" and "breaking" are the root words used to underline this dance
 in shabdon ko kala ke path ‚Äì pradarshkon or anya mahatvapurn nrity kalakaaron ke bahumat dwaara chunaa gaya he
 However, the popular term "street dance" is seen as a product of people immersed in hip-hop culture

:61 is nrity ke kalakaaron ko suchit karne ke liye bi-by, bi-girl or braker, jaise pasandida shabdon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 "b-boy" and "b-girl" were Herc's break dancers, described as "breaking"

 yah sudhaar or mishrit karne ke liye layaaddh aadhaar pradaan karata he or yah brake ke dauraan nartakon ko apana kaushal dikhaane kaa avasar pradaan karata he
 In a performance based on turns, the winning side is judged by the dancers to outperform each other on the basis of the intricate and new turns they make, while maintaining a specific rhythm of the break
 raak study samooh ke japan pahuchane ke turant baad, braking japan ke bheetar failana ‚Äìphoolnaa shuru ho gaya
 Every Sunday, the b-boys will perform a breaking performance at Tokyo's Yoyogi Park
 Japan's first and most influential breaker was crazy-a, the leader of the Tokyo Chapter's Rock Study Group
 vah vaarshik bi boy park kaa bhi aayojan karata he jo 10,000 prashansako ko aakarshith karne kaa kaary karata he or samskruti ke liye ek vyapak darshak varg ko udghaatit karne kaa kaary karata he
 a different but related dance style that acted to influence the breaking is the uprock, also known as rocking or Brooklyn rock
 aparok ek aakraamak nrity vidha he, jisamen do nartak sangeet kii swar lahariyon par nakli hathiyaaron kaa prayog karte hue ladane kaa abhinay karte hue nrity karte he
 Upprock could never become as popular as Breaking as its own dance mode
 Except for a few special rockers that were adopted by the breakers, who use it as their top rock variety
 :138 jab iskaa prayog bi-boy kii ladaai ke dauraan kiya jaataa he to pratidwandi saamaan ghumaav ke anusaar hi pratikriya dete he, jisase aisa lagata he ki choti aparok ladaai chal rahi ho
 kuch nartakon kaa tark hai ki chunki aparok mulat: nrity kii alag vidha he, at: ise braking ke saath mishrit nahin kiya janaa chahie or aaj ke brakers dwaara jis aparok ke ghumaav kaa prayog kiya jaataa he vah vaastavik ghumaav nahin he, balki nimna shrenee kii nakal he, jo mul aparok style ke maatr kuch anshon ko hi ujagar karne kaa kaary karata he
 Breaking is said to have ended the fight between the two gangs
 iske vipareet, kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki yah ek galat dharna hai ki bi-bowing ne kabhi bhi girohon ke bich kii pratidwandvita main madhyasth kii bhoomika nibhaai ho
 donon drushtikonon main kuch sachai avashya he
 Aparok has roots associated with the gang
 :116, 138 jab bhi maidan par ek mudda hota tha, jhagadate girohon ke do sardaar aparaaq karte the
 Whoever wins this initial battle decides where the real battle will be fought
 This was where the fighting mentality in breaking and hip-hop dance in general came into existence
 "sometimes the dance dealt with fights and sometimes it served to solve the over-leaked matter
 ":116 The four major elements combine to form braking
 isamen toprock, downerok, power move or fries / suicide shaamil he
 toprock is commonly used to indicate a series of steps taken in a standing position
 praaia: yah nrity style kaa pratham or mukhya khulaa hua pradarshan he, yadpi, nartak braking ke anya roopon se top rock or back kii ore pahunchate he
 Top rock has a variety of stages, each of which varies according to the dancer's expression
 The definition of Top Rock gives too much freedom, as long as the dancer stays clean, Roop and b-boy's point of view, so the theory: anything can be Top Rock
 top rock ne anya nrity shaileyon ko bhi apanaaya he jaise ki popping, loking or grih nrity

 fries ke saamaan hi suicidas kaa prayog sangeet kii shashakt dhun ko joardaar banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo ek niyamit kaarykram kii samaapti kaa suchak hota he
 Unlike Freezes, Suicide attracts attention for the speed of dropping or losing control, while Freezes draws attention for the final controlled position

 The unique style of a breaker not only informs toprock and down rock
 balki yah ek sankalpana he, jo yah pradarshit karata he ki kis tarah se move kaa sampaadan kiya jaataa he, na ki koun sa move kiya gaya he
 The choice of music for breaking is not limited to hip-hop music only, but it goes on until the conditions of tone and rhythm are met

 As Firelli - a full-time B-girl, states, "it's slowly becoming popular
