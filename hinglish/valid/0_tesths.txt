 vaakatak shabd kaa prayog pracheen bharat ke ek rajvansh ke liye kiya jaataa he jisane teesri sadi ke madhya se chhathi sadi tak shashan kiya tha
 Why that dynasty was related to this name is difficult to answer correctly
 syat vakaat naam kaa madhyabhaarat main koi sthaan rahaa ho, jahaan par shashan karanevaala vansh vaakatak kahalaaya
 Hence the first king is called "vakataka Vansketu:" in the Ajanta article
 is rajvansh kaa shashan madhyapradesh ke adhik bhubhag tathaa pracheen baraar par vistrut tha, jiske sarvapratham shaasha vindhyasakti kaa naam vayupurana tathaa ajantalekh me miltaa he
 Possibly the first king was conferred with the title of 'vindhyashakti' due to his rule over the Vindhya mountain region
 is naresh kaa pramanik itivrutt upasthit karnaa kathin he, kyonki vindhyashakti kaa koi abhilekh yaa sikaa abhi tak uplabdh nahin ho sakaa
 The decline of the Satavahana kingdom in the middle of the third century gave Vindhyashakti an opportunity even if its fame could not be sustained
 uske putr pratham pravarasen ne vansh kii pratishtha ko amar bana diya
 Studies of the inscriptions reveal that the first Pravarsena performed four Ashwamedha and held the title of emperor in the kingdom to elaborate on the south
 pravarasen ke samakaleen shaktishaalee naresh ke abhaav main vaakatak rajya andhrapradesh tathaa madhyabhaarat main vistrut ho gaya
 Vyaghraja, the subordinate ruler of Baghelkhand, is also mentioned in Samudragupta's column
 sambhavat: pravarasen ne chauthi sadi ke pratham charan main purvadakshin bharat, malwa, gujarat, kathiyawad par adhikaar kar liya tha parantu isaki pushti ke liye sabal pramaan nahin milte
 It is certain that Pravarsen's influence spread to the south
 parantu kitne bhaag par vah sidhaa shashan karata rahaa, yah spasht nahin he
 It is perfectly fair to say that it was his task to transform the Vakataka kingdom as an empire
 pratham pravarasen ne vaidic yagyon se isaki pushti kii he
 In the middle of the fourth century, his grandson succeeded the first Rudrasen kingdom, because Pravarsen's eldest son Gotamiputra had already died
 vaakatak vansh ke tisare shaasha maharaj rudrasen pratham kaa itihaas atyant vivaadaaspad mana jaataa he
 Initially he could not consolidate his position due to objections and weakness
 kuch vidvan yah maanate hai ki uske pitruvy samrajya ko vibhajit kar shashan karnaa chaahate the, kintu pitruvy sarvasen ke atirikt kisi kaa vrittant prapya nahin he
 Sarvesen had established his dominion in the southwestern part of the Vakataka kingdom, where his descendants ruled for the fifth century
 is prasang main yah maan lenaa sahi hoga ki uske naanaa bhaarshiv maharaj bhavanag ne rudrasen pratham kii visham paristhiti main sahaayta kii, jiske falswaroop rudrasen apni satta ko drudh kar sakaa
 With regard to the destruction of this Vakataka king, some people hold the false belief that Rudrasen i was destroyed by the rise of the Gupta dynasty
 gupt samrat samudragupta ne kaushambi ke yuddh main vaakatak naresh rudrasen pratham ko maar daalaa iske putr prithvishen pratham ne kuntal par vijay kar dakshin bharat main vaakatak vansh ko shaktishaalee banaaya
 Because of his important location, the Gupta emperor Chandragupta had to marry his daughter to the crown prince Rudrasen
 is vaivaahik sambandh ke kaaran gupt prabhaav dakshin bharat main atyadhik ho gaya
 As a result, the second Rudrasen, when he ascended the throne, supported his brother in the campaign of Kathiawad victory
 dwitiya rudrasen kii akaal mrityu ke kaaran uski patni prabhavati gupta apraptavyask putron kii sangrakshika ke rup main shashan karne lagi
 Second Chandragupta also gave active support by becoming the well-wisher of Vakataka rule
 patliputra se sahakaari karmchaaree niyukt kiye gaye
 This was the reason that the Gupta dynasty is mentioned in Prabhavati Gupta's Punatambrapatra

 Towards the end of the fifth century, the royalty passed into the hands of the ruler of Venimashakha, Harshana, who in the Ajanta article called the conquerors of the Kuntal, Avanti, Lat, Kosala, Kalinga and Andhra countries, was defeated by the Vakataka dynasty due to the weakening of the heirs
 abhilekhon ke adhyayan se gyaat hota he ki dakshin bharat main vaakatak rajya vaibhavshaalee, sabal tathaa gauravpurn rahaa he
 This dynasty also helped in cultural upliftment

 Its work in the field of art has also been appreciated
 ajanta kii chitrakala ko vaakatak kaal main adhik protsaahan mila, jo sansar main adwitiya bhittichitra mana gaya he
 The temple of Nachna was also built in this era and following the same architecture, there was Guhanirman in Udayagiri, Deogarh and Ajanta

 The architecture of Jaisalmer has a different significance in the cultural history of Jaisalmer
 kisi bhi sthaan vishesh par paae jane vaale sthapaty se vahaan rahane waalon ke chintan, vichaar, vishwaas evam bauddhik kalpanashiltaa kaa abhas hota he
 The order of architecture in Jaisalmer began with the establishment of the state from the construction of the fort, which continued continuously
 yahaan ke sthapaty ko rajkeey tathaa vyaktigat dono kaa satat prashray miltaa rahaa
 The architecture of this region is expressed by the forts, fortresses, palaces, temples, havelis, reservoirs, canopies and houses used by the common people
 jaisalmer rajya main har 20-30 kilometre ke faasale par chote-chote durg drushtigochar hote hai, ye durg vigat 1000 varsho ke itihaas ke mook gavaah hai
 They had absolute importance in medieval history
 ye rajnatik aavashyaktaanusaar nirmit karaae jate the
 In the construction of fortification, instead of beauty, robustness and safety were taken into consideration
 parantu yahaan ke durg majbootee ke saath-saath sundarataa ko bhi dhyaan man rakhkar banaaya gaya tha
 There is a tradition of keeping the fort in the same main
 durg mukhyatah pattharon dwaara nirmit hai, parantu kishangarh, shahgarh aadi durg iske apwaad hai
 These fortifications are made of concrete bricks
 prayek durg main chaar yaa isse adhik burj banaae jate the
 They gave strength, beauty and strategic importance to the fort
 jaisalmer nagar kaa vikaas 15 veen shatabdi se prarambh hota he
 When residential difficulties in the Jaisalmer Durg appeared, some people started living in the foothills of the fort by building a permanent residence
 bahut kam hi aise nagar hote hai, jinka apana sthapaty hota he
 Jaisalmer is also one of them
 is kaal main jaisalmer shaskaon kaa mughalon se sampark hua va unke sambandh sadaiv sauhardpurn bane rahane se rajya main shanti bani rahi
 For this reason, the activities of trade and commerce started gradually increasing here
 maheshwari, oswaal, paliwal va anya log aasapaas kii riyasaton se yahaan aakar basane lage va kalantar main yaheen bas gaye
 To settle these people, they made mohallas according to their gotra
 aamane-saamne ke makaanon se nirmit 20 se 100 makaanon ke muhalle, sidhi sadak yaa galiyon kaa nimarn hua or ye galiyaan ek duusare se judati chali gayin
 Thus the present city was built
 ye sagotreey, sadharm yaa vyavsaayee mohalle paada yaa mohalle kehalaate the va inhen vyavsaay ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Such as Beasana Pada, the locality of the petals and Churigar living in different neighborhoods of different businesses, different markets emerged in each locality here
 nagar ke purnrupen viksit hone par uski suraksha hetu aay bhi aavashyak prathit hone lage
 As a result, Maharawal Akhasingh got the city park built around 1740 AD, which was completed during the reign of Maharawal Moolraj II

 As a result, by the beginning of the 19th century, these people started constructing big havelis, bari temples etc
 for housing here

 There is no archival evidence of works done by Rawal Jaisal and Shalivahana

 There are mainly three havelis in the havelis

 ye sabhi haweliyaan sthaneey pile retile pathar se bani he
 This stone is considered best for excavation work
 ise ghisne par yah atyadhik chikna va chamkila ho jaataa he
 It seems as if passing through the inner and outer layers of any mansion, as if self-evidence is in sight, someone has peeped out of the window of the eyes wearing a pleasant yellow muffle or orbiting the sunshine of the sunshine Applying the eyelid may have killed the eyelids or have developed amalgam in the eyes and become yellow mountains in dry sandal sonal sand
 yahan ke lagbhag sabhi bhawan pile, kalatmak jharokhon se yukt, pili chadar main lipte manohari or drushti baandhne vaale
 The viewer's eyes are astonished by seeing the unique craftsmanship of the buildings
 mughal satta ke paraabhav ke uparaant sindh, gujarat va malwa kii ore se kai hindu va muslim kalakaar yahan aakar basane lage tathaa unhone in haweliyon kaa nirmaan kiya
 But if these artisans had come from Gujarat and Malwa, they would have got some original examples of their art, which are not available
 parantu jaisalmer rajya se lage sindh praant main sthaneey kala ke dheron udhaaharan praapt hote hai, jo ki sindh nadi ko paar karte hue baluchistan kii seemaa tak praapt hote hai
 Therefore, it is possible that the craftsmen must have come from Sindh province towards Jaisalmer for the carving done here
 sambhawatah lakdi ke kaam ke liye kalakaar malwa va gujarat se aae honge, kyonki ye donon hi praant is kaary hetu prasiddh hai
 These havelis with sixty-six vents are undoubtedly the best example of art

 Malik Muhammad Jayasi is a poet of the Nirguna Premashrayi stream of the Bhakti era of Hindi literature
 ve atyant ucchkoti ke saral or udaar sufi mahatma the
 Jayasi belonged to the Malik dynasty
 misramen senapati yaa pradhanmantri ko malik kehete the
 During the reign of the Khilji dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate, Alauddin Khilji appointed many Malikas to get his uncle killed, due to which the name became quite popular since that period
 iraan main malik jameendaar ko kaha jaataa tha va inke purvaj vahaan ke niglaam praant se aaye the or vahiin se unke purvajon kii padavi malik thi
 The descendants of Malik Muhammad Jayasi were disciples of the Ashrafi dynasty and were called Malik
 firoz shah tughlaq ke anusaar baarah hajaar sena ke risaldaar ko malik kaha jaataa tha
 Jayasi mentions Sheikh Burhan and Syed Ashraf as his gurus
 jaaysi kaa janm san 1500 ke aasapaas mana jaataa he
 He was from a place called Jais in Uttar Pradesh
 unke naam main jaaysi shabd kaa prayog, unke upnaam kii bhaanti, kiya jaataa he
 This also indicates that he was a resident of Jais Nagar
 is sambandh main unka swayan bhi kahana he- This shows that the ancient name of that city was Udayan, where they had come for ten days like one reached, that is, they had started or taken birth in their mortal life and then they got a lot of happiness when they got restless
 
 jaais naam kaa ek nagar uttar pradesh ke raibareli jile main aaj bhi vartmaan he, jiskaa ek purana naam udyannagar 'udyanagar yaa ujjalik nagar' batalaaya jaataa he tathaa uske kanchana khurd naamak muhalle main malik mohammad jaaysi kaa janm-sthaan hona bhi kaha jaataa he
 Some people believe that no definite mention of his fixed date of birth or birth-year is found under any available composition of Jayasi
 ek sthal par ve kehete hai, On the basis of this, it can only be estimated that he may have been born sometime between 800 h and 900 H, accordingly sometime between 1397 AD and 1494 AD and after attaining the age of thirty years, he started the work of poetry
 Would have done padmavat kaa rachanakaal unhone 947 hi0 arthath 1540 i0 batalaaya he
 On the basis of the last part of Padmavat, it can also be said that by the time of writing it, he had grown old
 unke pita kaa naam malik raaje ashraf bataaya jaataa he or kaha jaataa he ki ve maamuli zameendaar the or kheti karte the
 It is also famous to maintain livelihood by cultivating jayasi itself
 jaaysi ne apni kuch rachanaaon main apni guru-parampara kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 He says, Syed Ashraf, who was a dear saint, became a performer of the bright cult for me and he made my heart clean by lighting a lamp of love
 
 Jayasi was the common man and Kane
 ek manyata anusaar ve janm se aise hi the kintu adhiktar logon kaa mat he ki sheetala rog ke kaaran unka sharir vikrut ho gaya tha
 Jayasi himself has mentioned his existence as a poet - a gunman Muhammad Guni
 ab unki dahini yaa bain koun si aankh phooti thi, is bare main unheen ke is dohe ko sandarbh liya ja saktaa he: Muhammed left Disza, one Saravanan one eye
 iske anusaar yah bhi pratiti hoti he ki unhen baayein kaan se bhi unhen kam sunai padataa tha
 a story is heard in Jais that once Jaisi went to Sher Shah's court, he laughed seeing them
 tab inhone shant bhav se poocha - mohika hasasi, ki kohrhi? yani tu mujh par hansaa yaa us kumhaar par? tab shershah ne lajjit ho kar kshamaa maangi
 According to another belief, he did not go to Sher Shah's court, rather Sher Shah came to him after hearing his name
 sthaneey manyatanusaar jaaysi ke putr durghatana main makaan ke neeche dab kar maare gaye jiske falswaroop jaaysi sansar se virakt ho gaye or kuch dinon main ghar chhod kar yahaan vahaan fakir kii bhaanti ghoomane lage
 King Ramsingh of Amethi considered him very much
 apane antim dinon main jaaysi amethi se kuch dur ek ghaney jangal main rahaa karte the
 People say that when the last time came near, they told the king of Amethi that i would die by the arrow of a hunter, on which the king refused to hunt in the surrounding forests
 jis jangal main jaaysi rahete the, usamen ek shikari ko ek bada baagh dikhaai padaa
 He fired at him fearfully
 paas ja kar dekha to baagh ke sthaan par jaaysi mare pade the
 Jayasi sometimes used to take this form of yoga
 kaaji nasruddin hossain jaaysi ne, jinhen avadh ke nawab shujauddula se sanad mili thi, malik mohammad kaa mrityukaal rajjab 949 hijri bataaya he
 According to this, his death proves to be less than 49 years old, but what Jayasi has described in old age in the epilogue of 'padmavat' seems to be automatic
 jaaysi kii kabr amethi ke raja ke vartmaan mahal se lagbhag teen-chathai mile ke lagbhag he
 This present fort is built long after Jayasi's death
 amethi ke raajaaon kaa purana kila jaaysi kii kabr se dedh kos kii duuri par tha
 Therefore, the belief is prevalent that the king of Amethi had a son with the blessings of Jayasi and he built his grave near his fort, is baseless
 is baat ke bhi pramaan milte hai ki amethi naresh inke sangrakshak the
 According to another belief, he died in 1558
 unki 21 rachanaaon ke ullekh milte hai jisamen padmavat, akharavat, aakiri kalam, kaharanama, chitrarekha aadi pramukh hai
 But the basis of his fame is the Padmavat Granth
 isamen padmini kii prem-katha kaa rochak varnan hua he
 Ratnasen's first wife Nagmati has a unique account of disconnection
 isaki bhashaa avadhi he or isaki rachana-style par adikaal ke jain kaviyon kii doha chaupai paddati kaa prabhaav padaa he
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has ranked Jayasi as a prominent poet in the count of medieval poets
 sivakumar mishra ke anusaar shukla ji kii drushti jab jaaysi kii kavi pratibha kii ore gai or unhone jaaysi granthawali kaa sampadan karte hue unhen pratham shrenee ke kavi ke rup main pahachaanaa, uske pehle jaaysi ko is rup main nahin dekha or saraahaa gaya tha
 According to this, it seems natural that the poetic genius of Jaisi seems to be at the level of the medieval veteran poet Goswami Tulsidas
 isi kaaran se unhen tulsi ke samaksh jaaysi se bada kavi nahin dikhaa
 According to Shukla ji, the area of jaisi is narrower than that of Tulsi, but Premvedana is highly esoteric

 On his return to Nagpur in 1915, he became active in the Congress and later became the secretary of the Vidarbha Provincial Congress
 When the country level session of the Congress was held in Nagpur in 1920, Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar presented the first proposal in the Congress about the goal of complete independence, then it was not passed
 In 1921, Satyagraha was arrested in the non-cooperation movement of the Congress and he was imprisoned for one year
 By then he had become so popular that veterans like Pandit Motilal Nehru and Hakim Ajmal Kha addressed the gathering organized to welcome him upon his release

 This was the reason that when the anti-salt law movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi in December 1930, he personally handed over the responsibility of the Sangh chief to Dr
 Parapanje along with a dozen of his colleagues, in which he was imprisoned for 9 months
 Similarly, in 1929 when the resolution of the former Swaraj was passed in the Congress session held in Lahore and on 26 January 1930, a call was made to hoist the tricolor across the country, on the instructions of Dr
 Hedgewar Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar in all the Sangh branches on January 30

 It was with his original manuscript

 In such a situation, many Hindu leaders went to malabar-kerala to know the state of Kerala and to help the looted Hindus there, among them prominent Hindu Mahasabhai leader of Nagpur, Dr
 Balakrishna Shivram Munje, Dr
 Hedgewar, Arya Samaj leader Swami Shraddhanand ji etc
 After a while there were hindu-muslim riots in Nagpur and many other cities too
 Distracted by such incidents, Dr
 Munje in Nagpur has made some famous Called a meeting of Hindu leaders, including Dr
 Hedgewar and Dr
 Paranjpe, in this meeting they decided to make a hindu-militia, the aim was to "protect Hindus and make Hindustan a strong Hindu nation"
 Dharamvir Dr
 Munje gave the responsibility of standing to Dr
 Keshav Baliram Hedgewar
 dosahab aise vyakti the, jinhone vyakti kii kshamtaaon ko ubhaarne ke liye naye-naye taur-tareeke viksit kiye
 However, keeping in mind the unsuccessful revolution and erstwhile circumstances of the first Indian independence struggle, he laid the foundation of a paramilitary organization

 pitrubhu-punyabhu Bhushchev sa Hindu Hindu tradition is shloke ke anusaar “bharat ke vah sabhi log hindu hai jo is desh ko pithrubhumi-punyabhumi maanate hai”l iname sanatani, aryasamaji, jain, buddha, sikh aadi panthon evam dharm vichaar ko maanane vaale va unka aacharan karne vaale samast jan ko hindu ke vyapak daayre main rakhaa gaya tha l musalmaan va isai is paribhaasha main nahin aate the atah unako is milicia main naa lene kaa nirnay liya gaya or keval hinduon ko hi liya janaa tay hua, mukhya mantra tha “aspashtataa nivaaran evam hinduon kaa sainiki kaaran”l To create such a militia, volunteers were recruited, branches were started for one hour each morning and evening
 To make it run smoothly, posts of teacher, head teacher, event etc
 were created
 In these branches it was decided to provide military education to senior volunteers along with exercise, manual labor, education of Hindu nationalism
 Sometimes during the night there were seminars of volunteers, including Maharana Pratap, Veer Shivaji, Guru Govind Singh, Banda Bairagi, Veer Savarkar, Mangal Pandey, Tantya Tope etc
 Biographies were read l used to tell me to read portions of the book written by Savarkar l thode samay baad is milicia ko naam diya gaya rashtriya swanyasevak sangh- jo aar

 dow headgavar ne jis dukhad sthiti ko vyakt kiya, usamen navsarjeet rashtriya swanyasevak sangh or hindu mahasabha ke netritv ke prayaas se- hindu yuvaaon main saahas ke saath yah naaraa gunjane laga “hindusthan hinduon kaa- nahin kisi ke baap kaa” is kathan kii vivechna dow headgavar ne in shabdon main kii:- “many gentlemen do not hesitate to say how Hindusthan is only for Hindus? This is the case of all those who live here
 Sorry that such statement / gentlemen do not know the meaning of the word nation
 Only a piece of land is not called a nation
 The people who have lived in the civilization and tradition since ancient times, a nation is formed by the culture of the same people
 This country has been named Hindusthan because of us
 If other people give it through communication If you want to settle in, then you can definitely settle
 We have never denied them, but we will not get even a single place here for those who come to our house as guests and take a knife on our neck
 l First get this ideology of Sangh right
 ek anya avasar par dow headgavar ne kaha tha “sangh to keval, hindusthan hinduon kaa- is dhyey vaakya ko sachcha kar dikhaanaa chahta he l” duusare deshon ke saamaan, “yah hinduon kaa hone ke kaaran”- is desh main hindu jo kahenge vahi purv disha hogi l yahi ek baat he jo sangh jaanata he, rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ke liye kisi bhi anya pachade main padane kii aavashkata nahin he l” When Veer Savarkar was off sight in Ratnagiri, Dr
 Hedgewar went to meet him there
 tab tak vah vir saavarkar rachit pustak hindutv bhi pard chuke the
 Dr
 Hedgewar was very impressed with the ideas of that book and praised it saying that "veer Savarkar is an ideal person"
 donon kaa vishwaas tha ki jab tak hindu andh vishwaas, puraani roodhiwaadee soch, dharmik aadambaron ko nahin chhodenge tab tak hindu-jateevaad, chhot-achhut, shahari-banavaasi or chhetravaad ityadi main banta rahegaa or jab tak vah sangathit evam ek jute nahin hoga, tab tak vah sansar main apana uchit sthaan nahin le sakegaa
 In 1937, Veer Savarkar's termination ended and after that he could participate in politics

 In 1937, the Hindu Mahasabha was held in Karnavati

 Among the founders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the two main men were Dr
 Munje and Dr
 Hedgewar Hindu Mahasabhai and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh formed the basis of the interpretation of Hindu and Hindu nationalism propounded by Veer Savarkar, as well as the original mantra of Veer Savarkar- Untouchability
 The principle of prevention and militarization of Hindus was accepted

 Veer Savarkar said that if Arya Samaj agrees with the movement, then the Hindu Mahasabha will give it full support

 ramanujacharya ne veydant ke alaava saatvin-dasvin shatabdi ke rahasywaadee evam bhaktimargi alwar santon ke bhakthi-darshan tathaa dakshin ke pancharaatr parampara ko apane vichaaron kaa aadhaar banaaya
 Ramanuja was born in 1017 AD in the Tamil Nadu province of South India
 bachapan main unhone kanchi jaakar apane guru yadav prakaash se vedon kii shiksha lee
 Ramanujacharya was the principal disciple of Alavar Sant Yamunacharya
 guru kii icchaanusaar ramanuj se teen vishesh kaam karne kaa sankalp karaayaa gaya tha - brahmasutra, vishnu sahasranam or divya prabandham kii tikaa likhnaa
 He renounced the householder ashram and took initiation of renunciation from a monk named Yetiraja of Srirangam
 mysore ke shrirangam se chalakar ramanuj shaligram naamak sthaan par rahane lage
 Ramanuja preached Vaishnavism for twelve years in that region
 uske baad to unhone vaishnav dharm ke prachaar ke liye puure bharatvarsh kaa hi bhraman kiya
 He attained the age of 120 in 1137 AD
 unhone yun to kai granthon kii rachana kii kintu brahmasutra ke bhashya par likhe unke do mul granth sarvaadhik lokapriy hue - shribhashyam evam veydant sangraham
 In Ramanujacharya's philosophy, three levels have been considered in relation to power or God - Brahma ie God, Chit ie Atman and Prakrit means Nature
 vastutah ye chit arthath aatm tatva tathaa achit arthath prakruti tatva brahm yaa ishwar se pruthak nahin he balki ye vishisht rup se brahm ke hi do swaroop hai evam brahm yaa ishwar par hi aadhaarit hai
 In fact, this is the principle of Ramanujacharya's Vichitadvaita
 jaise sharir evam aatma pruthak nahin hai tathaa aatm ke uddeshy kii purti ke liye sharir kaary karata he usee prakaar brahm yaa ishwar se pruthak chit evam achit tatva kaa koi astitv nahin hai
 They are the body of Brahma or God and Brahma or God is like their soul
 ramanuj ke anusaar bhakthi kaa arth puja-paath yaa kirthan-bhajan nahin balki dhyaan karnaa yaa ishwar kii prarthana karnaa he
 From a social perspective, Ramanujacharya considered devotion as separate from caste and class and possible for all

 mishan imposible ke naam se nimnlikhit prishth maujuud he: Samudra Manthan is a famous Hindu religious legend
 yah katha bhagwat puraana, mahabharat tathaa vishnu puraana main aati he
 Shri Shukdev Ji said, "O Rajan! In the kingdom of King Bali, demons, demons and demons had become very strong
 unhen shukracharya kii shakti praapt thi
 Meanwhile, Devraj Indra became powerless due to the curse of Durvasa Rishi
 daityaraj bali kaa rajya teenon lokon par tha
 The gods including Indra were afraid of him
 is sthiti ke nivaaran kaa upaay keval baikunthanath vishnu hi bataa sakate the, atah brahma ji ke saath samast devtaa bhagwaan narayan ke paas pahuche
 Praising him, he narrated his calamity to Lord Vishnu
 tab bhagwaan madhur vaani main bole ki is samay tum logon ke liye sankat kaal he
 Demons, demons and demons are getting uplifted and you people are getting downgraded
 kintu sankat kaal ko maitreepurn bhav se vyateet kar dena chaiye
 You befriend the demons and churn the Kshira Sagar and drink nectar from it and drink it
 daityon kii sahaayta se yah kaary sugamawa se ho jaayegaa
 Accept their every condition for this work and in the end take out your work
 amrit pikar tum amar ho jaaoge or tumme daityon ko maarane kaa samarthy aa jaayegaa
 "according to the Lord's order, Indra told Bali about the elimination of nectar from the churning of the sea
 daityaraj bali ne devraj indra se samjhauta kar liya or samudr manthan ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 The Mandarachal mountain was made a churner and Vasuki Nag a neti
 vasuki ke netra se netag kaa udbhav hua
 Lord Vishnu himself took the Kachhap avatar and placed Mandarachal mountain on his back and became its base
 bhagwaan narayan ne daanav rup se daanvon main or devtaa rup se devataaon main shakti kaa sanchaar kiya
 By giving deep sleep to Vasuki Nag too, he defeated his suffering
 devtaa vasuki naag ko mukh kii ore se pakadaney lage
 The demons, demons, demons and demons with vomiting intellect thought that there would be some benefit in catching Vasuki Nag from his mouth
 unhone devataaon se kaha ki ham kisi se shakti main kam nahin hai, ham munh kii ore kaa sthaan lenge
 Then the gods took the place on the tail side of Vasuki Nag
 "samudr manthan armbh hua or bhagwaan kacchap ke ek lakh yojan chaudee peeth par mandarachal parvat ghoomane laga
 Hey Rajan! The first to speak of sea churning was the poison of water
 us vish kii jwaala se sabhi devtaa tathaa daitya jalane lage or unki kaanti feeki padane lagi
 Everyone prayed to Lord Shankar on this
 unki prarthana par mahadev ji us vish ko hatheli par rakh kar use pi gayi kintu use kanth se neeche nahin utarane diya
 Due to the effect of that Kalkut poison, Shiva's gorge turned blue
 isiliye mahadev ji ko nilkantha kehete hai
 a little poison had dripped from his palm on the earth, which poisonous animals like snakes, scorpions, took
 "vish ko shankar bhagwaan ke dwaara paan kar lene ke pashchaat phir se samudr manthan prarambh hua
 The second jewel came out the Kamadhenu cow, which was kept by the sages
 phir ucchanshrava ghoda niklaa jise daityaraj bali ne rakh liya
 After that Airavat elephant came out which was taken by Devraj Indra
 airavat ke pashchaat kaustubhamani samudr se nikali use vishnu bhagwaan ne rakh liya
 Then Kalpavriksha came out and Apsara named Rambha emerged
 in donon ko devloak main rakh liya gaya
 Next, Lakshmi came out from churning the sea
 lakshmi ji ne swayan hi bhagwaan vishnu ko var liya
 After that Varuni appeared in the form of a girl whom the demons assumed
 phir ek ke pashchaat ek chandramaa, parijaat vriksh tathaa shankh nikle or ant main dhanvantari vaidya amrit kaa ghat lekar prakat huye
 "the demons snatched the nectar from Dhanvantari's hand and started fighting for it among themselves
 devataaon ke paas durvasa ke shaapvash itani shakti rahi nahin thi ki ve daityon se ladakar us amrit ko le saken isaliye ve niraash khadey huye unka aapas main ladanaa dekhte rahe
 Seeing the despair of the Gods, Lord Vishnu immediately took the form of Mohini and reached the demons fighting among themselves
 us vishwamohini rup ko dekhakar daitya tathaa devataaon kii to baat hi kya, swayan brahmagyani, kaamdev ko bhasma kar dene vaale, bhagwaan shankar bhi mohit hokar unki ore baar-baar dekhne lage
 When the demons saw that new young girl coming towards them, then they forgot all their quarrel and started looking at the beautiful girl and looked at them
 ve daitya bole, "he sundari! tum koun ho? lagata he ki hamaare jhagade ko dekhakar uskaa nibatara karne ke liye hi ham par krupa kataaksh kar rahi ho
 Come on! You are welcome
 hamen apane sundar kar kamalon se yah amritpan karaao
 Vishnu as Vishnu Mohini said, "O gods and demons!" Due to being the son of Maharishi Kashyap ji, both of you are brother and brother, yet you fight with each other
 main to swechhacharini stri hoon
 Wise people never believe such a woman, then how are you believing in me? It is good that you all join yourself and take Amritpan
 " On hearing such proverbial words of Vishwamohini, those humble demons, demons and asuras became even more confident in him
 ve bole, "sundari! ham tum par purna vishwaas he
 We will consume Amritpan in the same way you will share
 tum ye ghat le lo or ham sabhi main amrit vitaran karo
 "vishwamohini took the nectar and asked the gods and the demons to sit in separate rows
 uske baad daityon ko apane kataaksh se madahosh karte huye devataaon ko amritpan karaane lage
 The demons became so obsessed with their sarcasm that they forgot to drink nectar
 bhagwaan kii is chaal ko rahu naamak daitya samaj gaya
 He sat down among the gods after making the form of a deity and put the received nectar in the mouth
 jab amrit uske kanth main pahunch gaya tab chandramaa tathaa surya ne pukaar kar kaha ki ye rahu daitya he
 Hearing this, Lord Vishnu immediately separated his head from the neck with his Sudarshan Chakra
 amrit ke prabhaav se uske sir or dhad rahu or ketu naam ke do grah ban kar antariksh main sthapit ho gayi
 He is the one who gets the sun and the moon due to hatred
 is tarah devataaon ko amrit pilaakar bhagwaan vishnu vahaan se lop ho gayi
 The demise of the demons ended soon after their disappearance
 ve atyant krodhit ho devataaon par prahaar karne lage

 Among them, the names of Sonu Nigam, Muhammad Aziz and Udit Narayan are notable - although many of them now have their own distinct identity

 On 24 December 2017, on the 93rd birthday of Mohammed Rafi ji, Google honored him and made a doodle in his memory and dedicated his songs and his memories
 The doodle was created by Mumbai painter Sajid Sheikh
 mohammad rafi kaa janm 24 disambar 1924 ko amritsar, ke paas kotla sultan singh main hua tha
 His family moved from Lahore to Amritsar in the early childhood
 inke parivaar kaa sangeet se koi khaas sarokaar nahin tha
 When Rafi was younger, his elder brother had a barber shop, Rafi used to spend a lot of time there
 kaha jaataa he ki rafi jab saat saal ke the to ve apane bade bhai kii dukaan se hokar guzarane vaale ek fakir kaa peechha kiya karte the jo udhar se gaate hue jaaya karata tha
 Rafi liked his voice and Rafi used to imitate him
 unki nakal main awvalata ko dekhakar logon ko unki aawaaj bhi pasand aane lagi
 People started praising her songs in the barber shop
 lekin isse rafi ko sthaneey khyaati ke atirikt or kuch nahin mila
 His elder brother Mohammad Hameed noticed his interest in his music and asked him to take music education to Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan
 ek baar akashwani lahore main us samay ke prakhyat gayak-abhinayta kundan laal sahagal apana pradarshan karne aae the
 Mohammad Rafi and his elder brother also went to hear this
 bijli gul ho jane kii vajah se sahagal ne gane se manaa kar diya
 Rafi's elder brother requested the organizers that Mohammad Rafi should be given a chance to sing in order to calm the anxiety of the crowd
 unako anumati mil gai or 13 varsh kii aayu main mohammad rafi kaa ye pehla saarvajanik pradarshan tha
 Among the observers, Shyam Sundar, who was a famous musician of that time, also heard him and was impressed
 unhone mohammad rafi ko apane liye gane kaa nyauta diya
 Mohammed Rafi's first song was for a Punjabi film Gul Baloch which he sang in 1944 under the direction of Shyam Sundar
 san 1946 main mohammad rafi ne bombay aane kaa faisla kiya
 Music composer Naushad gave him the opportunity to sing in a film called Aap
 naushaad dwaara surabaddh geet tera khilonaa tutaa se rafi ko pratham baar hindi jagat main khyaati mili
 After this, Rafi sang songs in Shaheed, Mela and Dulari which became very famous
 1951 main jab naushaad film baiju baavaraa ke liye gane bana rahe the to unhone apane pasandida gayak talat mahmud se gavaane kii sochi thi
 It is said that once he saw Talat Mehmood smoking he changed his mind and asked Rafi to sing
 baiju baavaraa ke gaanon ne rafi ko mukhyadhara gayak ke rup main sthapit kiya
 Naushad then gave Rafi many songs to sing under his direction
 lagbhag isi samay sangeetkaar jodi shankar-jaykishan ko unki aawaaj pasand aayi or unhone bhi rafi se gane gavaana aarambh kiya
 Shankar Jaikishan was Raj Kapoor's favorite composer at the time, but Raj Kapoor liked Mukesh's voice only
 baad main jab shankar jaykishan ke gaanon kii maang badi to unhone lagbhag har jagah rafi sahab kaa prayog kiya
 Even Rafi Sahab sang for Raj Kapoor many times
 jald hi sangeetkaar sachin dev burman tathaa ullekhneey rup se o pi naiyyar ko rafi kii awaz bahut raas aayi or unhone rafi se gavaana aarambh kiya
 OP Nayyar's name will be remembered in it as he used the rafi-asha duo in his unique style and his tinkling tunes still seem different from other composers of that era
 unke nirdesan main gaae gaano se rafi ko bahut khyaati mili or phir ravi, madan mohan, gulam haidar, jayadev, salil choudhary ityadi sangeetkaaron kii pehali pasand rafi sahab ban gaye
 After singing for artists such as Dilip Kumar, Bharat Bhushan and Devanand, the list of artists who performed on their songs increased
 shammi kapur, rajendra kumaar, joy mukherjee, vishwajit, rajesh khanna, dharmendra ityadi kalakaaron ke liye rafi kii aawaaj prishthbhumi main gunjane lagi
 Shammi Kapoor was so impressed with Rafi's voice that he used Rafi in each of his songs
 unke liye sangeet kabhi o pi naiyyar ne diya to kabhi shankar jaykishan ne par aawaaj rafi kii hi rahi
 Whether someone calls me Junglee, Ehsaan Tera Hoga Mujper Mein, Ye Chand Sa Roshan Face, Deewana Hua Badal is one of the popular songs filmed on top of Shammi Kapoor
 dhire-dhire inaki khyaati itani bad gayi ki abhinayta inhen se gaanaa gavaane kaa aagrah karne lage
 Rajendra Kumar, Dilip Kumar and Dharmendra did not believe that any other singer would sing for them
 
 In the 1950s, Shankar Jaikishan, Naushad and Sachin Dev Burman sang very popular songs of that time from Rafi
 yah silsilaa 1960 ke dashak main bhi chalata rahaa
 The composer Ravi used Mohammed Rafi in the 1960s
 1960 main film chaudaavin kaa chand ke sheershak geet ke liye rafi ko apana pehla film fere puraskaar mila
 After this, in films like Gharana, Kajal, Do Badan and Neelkamal, the pair of these two gave many memorable songs
 1961 main rafi ko apana doosraa filmphere award film sasuraal ke geet teri pyaari pyaari surat ko ke liye mila
 The composer duo Laxmikant Pyarelal made their debut with Rafi's vocals and composed very beautiful songs for the film Parasmani in 1963
 inamen salaamat raho tathaa wo jab yaad aaye ullekhneey he
 In 1965, Rafi received the third Filmfare Award for the song i want to sing for the film Dosti under the musical direction of lakshmi-pyare
 1965 main unhen bharat sarkaar ne padmashri puraskaar se nawaja
 In 1965, the music of the song Jab Jab Phool Khile by music composer duo kalyanji-anandji reached the top of popularity with Naa Akhiyan from Pardesi
 1966 main film suraj ke geet bahaaron phool barasaao bahut prasiddh hua or iske liye unhen chauthaa filmphere award mila
 Its music was given by Shankar Jaikishan
 1968 main shankar jaykishan ke sangeet nirdesan main film brahmacharee ke geet dil ke jharokhe main tujko bithakar ke liye unhen pachvaan filmphere award mila
 The end of the decade was not pleasant for him after he reached the top of his career in the 1960s
 1969 main shakti samant apni ek film aradhana kaa nirmaan karvaa rahe the jiske liye unhone sachin dev burman ko sangeetkaar chunaa
 In the same year, Dada fell ill and his son Rahul Dev Burman = Avrohan == The end of the decade was not pleasant for him after he reached the top of his career in the 1960s
 1969 main shakti samant apni ek film aradhana kaa nirmaan karvaa rahe the jiske liye unhone sachin dev burman ko sangeetkaar chunaa
 This year, Dada fell ill and asked his son Rahul Dev Burman to record the song
 us samay rafi haj ke liye gaye hue the
 Panchamada got a chance to sing from his favorite singer Kishore Kumar and got it recorded in the voice of Roop Tera Mastana and Mere Sapne Rani songs Kishore Da
 ye dono gane bahut hi lokapriy hue or is gane ke abhinayta rajesh khanna nirdeshkon tathaa janata ke bich apaar lokapriy hue
 Along with this, singer Kishore Kumar also became the first choice of public and music directors
 iske baad rafi ke gayak jivan kaa avsaan aarambh hua
 However, even after this, he gave many hit songs, such as Yeh Duniya Yeh Mahfil, Yeh Jo Chilman Hai, Tum Jo Mil Gaya
 1977 main film ham kisi se kam nahin ke geet kya hua tera vaada ke liye unhe apane jivan kaa chatha tathaa antim film fere eword mila
 Mohammad Rafi was a very devoted Muslim, a man away from addictions and a shy man
 aazaadee ke samay vibhaajan ke dauraan unhone bharat main rahanaa pasand kiya
 He married Begum Wikis and had seven children - four sons and three daughters
 mohammad rafi ko unke parmartho ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 He was very cheerful and generous and always ready to help everyone
 kai filmi geet unhonen bina paise liye yaa behad kam paison lekar gaaye
 In his early days, he sang for the composer duo laxmikant-pyarelal for very little money
 gaanon kii roylty ko lekar lata mangeshkar ke saath unka vivaad bhi unki dariyaadilii kaa suchak he
 At that time, Lataji said that even after singing the songs, singers and singers should get a part of the income from those songs
 rafi sahab iske kilaaf the or unka kahana tha ki ek baar gane record ho gaye or gayak-gayikaon ko unki fees kaa bhugtan kar diya gaya ho to unako or paison kii aashaa nahin kerani chahie
 There was a conflict between the two great artists about this
 lata ne rafi ke saath set par gane se manaa kar diya or barason tak dono kaa koi yugal geet nahin aayaa
 Later, at the behest of actress Nargis, both of them started singing together and sang Dil Pukare in the Jewel Thief film
 unka dehant 31 july 1980 ko hridaygati ruk janeke kaaran hua
 There is some controversy over how many songs Rafi sang in his life
 1970 ke dashak main gineez book of world ricards ne likhaa ki sabase adhik gane ricard karne kaa shrey lata mangeshkar ko praapt he, jinhone kul 25,000 gane ricard kiye hai
 Rafi wrote a letter to the Guinness Book, refuting it
 iske baad ke sanskarnon main gineez book ne donon gayakon ke daawey saath-saath pradarshit kiye or mohammad rafi ko 1944 or 1980 ke bich 28,000 gane ricard karne kaa shrey diya
 In the subsequent search, Vishwas Nerurkar found that Lata had actually sung only 5,044 songs till 1989
 anya shodhakartaaon ne bhi is tathy ko sahi mana he
 Additionally, Raju Bharatan found that between 1948 and 1987 only 35,000 Hindi songs were recorded
 aise main rafi ne 28,000 gane gaae is baat par yakeen karnaa mushkil he, lekin kuch strot ab bhi is sankhya ko uddhrut karte hai
 After this research, in 1992, the Guinness Book removed the above record of singing from the book
