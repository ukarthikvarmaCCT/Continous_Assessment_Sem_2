 to aaie ek baar america ke us veli parivaar or us khaufnak ghar ke baaren main jaanaten he
 The Veli House was a house that was built in solitude in Old San Diego California
 is makaan ko thomas veli ne khud dizin kiya tha or us samay 10,000 dollars kaa kharchaa is makaan par kiya tha
 The Veli House is a very large house, in which the modern comforts of that time were fully arranged
 veli house kon thomas veli ne san 1857 main banwaaya tha, thomas veli kaa janm america ke neuyark shahar main san 1823 main hua tha
 Thomas settled in New York after staying in New York for a few days and built his Valley House there
 us samay unke saath unki patni or teen bachein bhi is ghar main rahane ke liye aayen the
 Accidents at Veli House began with the death of Veli's 18-month-old son, Junier Thomas
 thomas abhi 18 maheene kaa hi hua tha ki use tej fever ne apane kabje main le liya or uski maut ho gayi
 Let me tell you that before the Veli family came to this house, Thomas believed that this house is occupied by souls
 aisa bataaya jaataa he ki jis saal unhone is ghar ko banvaanaa shuru kiya tha usee varsh ek vyakti ne faansee lagaakar jaan de di thi or uski aatma aaj bhi makaan ke irdagird gumti rahati he
 After the death of the son, two more daughters were born in this family after a few years
 uske kuch saalon ke baad thomas kii patni kii bhi bimaari ke kaaran maut ho gayi
 Thomas' eldest son, Violet Velie, married a girl named George T
 Burto
 shaadi ke kuch dinon baad hi donon kaa talaak ho gaya or vilat yah sadma bardaash na kar sakaa or usne apane kamare main khud ke seene ko goli se maar kar aatmahtya kar lee
 At the same time, Thomas' second daughter, Anna Alia, married John Twethi
 jo ki usee ghar main rahaa karata tha, ghar main pehle se maujuud ruho ne apana asar dikhaanaa shuru kar diya tha or ek ek karke thomas parivaar par apana asar dikhaa rahe the
 Meanwhile, Sun John also died due to illness
 mauton kaa jo ye silsilaa shuru hua to san 1961 tak chalata rahaa or ek ek kar is ghar ke sabhi sadasyon kii maut ho gayi
 The Valley House, which became the cause of death of its own builders, because of this no one was ready to buy this house
 logon kaa maananaa tha ki jo bhi is makaan ko kharidega yaa isamen rahegaa use bhi i ruhen maut de degi
 Even today, in this house, Thomas is felt walking in his room
 sabase khaayfnaak manjar to wo he jab aalia apane kamren main apane baalo ko savanrati he, us samay uski chaaya saaf taur par aaine main dekhi ja sakati he
 At the same time, some people have sensed that other members are also in the rooms behind the house
 is ghar ko sarkaar ne ab apane kabje main le liya he
 An arrangement called Ghost Hunters was conducted in this house
 research kii team main shaamil ek vyakti ne bataaya ki jab wo is ghar main pravesh kar rahaa tha usee samay raat ke 1 baje rahaa hoga or chaaron taraf bhayanak adheraa tha
 When he entered the first room inside the house, he felt that a woman who was carrying something in her hands was going towards the door of the inner room
 jab us vyakti ne use pukaara to usne peeche dekha us samay uske baalo se uskaa puraa cheharaa dhakaa tha or haathon main ek kanghee kii jaisi koi cheez thi
 At that time, when that member of the team lit the torch on him, he got into that door
 iske alaanva veli house main vilat ke kamare main jab wo gaya to use mahasoos hua ki koi uske peeche peeche aa rahaa he or jab usne peeche palat kar dekha to veli kaa puraa parivaar uske peeche khada tha
 Seeing this, he quickly entered the room of the Violet where there was a resting chair which was moving on its own
 jab wo kursi ke paas gaya to usne dekha ki khatre kii khidki jis par sheeshen lage huai the us sheeshen se koi andar dekh rahaa tha
 At that moment when the member ran to the window, the shadow that was peeping through the window jumped down
 uske baad usne khidki ke sheeshen par gaur kiya to use laga ki sheeshen par jaise taajen khun ke dhabbe lagen the
 Those who died in Veli House are no longer human in this world, but their soul has not been able to leave Veli House even today
 aap bhi aaj un ruhon ko aasaani se mahasoos kar sakate he
 All that is needed is a little courage and desire
 veli house ko sarkaar ne ek mujium ke taur par shuru kar diya he
 Today many people go to Veli House and feel the family of Thomas Veli
 lekin sarkaar ne makaan ke kuch hisson ko pratibandhit kar diya he

 is kaarykram ko pryojit kiya pariklpana samay ne
 Consciousness is the name of the power of some living beings to understand the elements of themselves and their surroundings, to understand them and to evaluate their things
 vigyaan ke anusaar chetana vah anubhuti he jo mastishk main pahunchnewale abhigami aavegon se utpann hoti he
 These impulses are interpreted immediately or later
 bahut puraane kaal se pramastishk praantastha chetana kii mukhya indriya, athwa pramukh sthaan, mana gaya he
 Out of this, special importance has been given to the area of poorvalat
 parantu penfield or yaspers chetana ko nae tareeke se hi samajhaate hai
 According to him, the place of consciousness is around the upper part of the Chetak, the Hypnosis and the upper brain
 ve log mastishk ke in bhaagon ko or unke sanyojanon ko snaayuon ke sanghathan kaa sarvocch str maanate hai
 There is a connection between the east frontal region and the supernatant by outgoing channels
 sangyojan pratyaksh athwa paroksh he
 The indirect combination is by the centroid
 in naadiyon kaa sambandh pouns se bhi he
 Consciousness is the characteristic of man that keeps him alive and which makes him knowledge about personal subject and his environment
 isi gyaan ko vichaarshakti kaha jaataa he
 This attribute works in humans because of which it is considered a living being
 manushya apni koi bhi shaareerik kriya tab tak nahin kar saktaa jab tak ki usko yah gyaan pehle na ho ki vah us kriya ko kar sakegaa
 No man can move his limb to avoid a fatal substance or event unless he is aware that a deadly substance is in front of him and he can use his limbs to avoid it
 is
 udaahranarth, ham ek aise manushya ke bare main soch sakate hai jo nadi kii ore ja rahaa he
 If he reaches the river while walking and enters the river, he will die by drowning
 vah apana chalanaa tab tak nahin roak saktaa or nadi main ghusane se apane ko tab tak nahin bachaa saktaa jab tak ki uski chetana main yah gyaan utpann nahin hota ki uske samane nadi he or vah jameen par to chal saktaa he, parantu pani par nahin chal saktaa
 The above rule applies to all human actions, whether these actions have happened before or in the future
 manushya keval chetana se utpann prerana ke kaaran koi kaam kar saktaa he
 There is a fundamental connection between consciousness and the character of man
 chetana vah vishesh gun he jo manushya ko jivit banaati he or charitra uskaa vah sampurna sanghathan he jiske dwaara uske jivit rahane kii vaastaviktaa vyakt hoti he tathaa jiske dwaara jivan ke vibhinn kaary chalaae jate hai
 The consciousness and character of a human being are not only his personal property
 ye bahut dinon ke saamaajik prakram ke parinaam hote hai
 Each person presents their inheritance in themselves
 vah vishesh prakaar ke sanskaar paitrik sampatti ke rup main paata he
 He also represents history in itself, because he has found different types of education and training in life
 iske atirikt vah duusare logon ko bhi apane dwaara nirupit karata he, kyonki unka prabhaav uske jivan par unke udhaaharan, upadesh tathaa avapeedan ke dwaara padaa he
 Once man's consciousness develops, then his natural freedom is gone
 vah aisi avasthaa main bhi vibhinn preranaon or bhitari pravritiyon se prerit hota he, parantu vah unhen swatantraaa se prakashit nahin kar saktaa
 He either suppresses them completely so that they do not become an impediment to the needs and desires of other people in the society, or they are flattened, or artificial, in which their publication is not anti-social
 is prakaar manushya kii chetana athwa viveki man uske avchetan, athwa prakritik, man par apana niyantran rakhata he
 This is the special distinction between man and animal
 pashuon ke jivan main is prakaar kaa niyantran nahin rahata, atev jaisaa ve chaahate hai vaisaa karte hai
 Human being is a conscious creature, so before taking any action, he thinks well about its result
 manovigyaan kii drushti se chetana maanav main upasthit vah tatv he jiske kaaran use sabhi prakaar kii anubhutiyaan hoti hai
 It is because of consciousness that we see, hear, understand and think on many topics
 isi ke kaaran hamen sukh-du:kha kii anubhuti bhi hoti he or ham isi ke kaaran anek prakaar ke nishchay karte tathaa anek padaarthon kii prapti ke liye cheshtaa karte hai
 There are three characteristics of human consciousness
 vah gyanatmak, bhavatmak or kriyaatmak hoti he
 Indian philosophers have called it Sachchidananda form
 aadhunik manovaigyanikon ke vichaaron se ukt niropagya kii pushti hoti he
 Consciousness is the element in which there is a feeling of knowledge, of emotion and of person, that is, action
 jab ham kisi padaarth ko jaanate hai, to uske swaroop kaa gyaan hamen hota he, uske prati priy athwa apriy bhav paidaa hota he or uske prati ichha paidaa hoti he, jiske kaaran yaa to ham use apane sameep laate athwa use apane se dur hataate hai
 Consciousness has been considered as a self-illuminating element in philosophy
 manovigyaan abhi tak chetana ke swaroop main aage nahin bad sakaa he
 Consciousness makes all things, root conscious, body mind, inanimate living, brain, etc
, represent their nature
 phir chetana ko inke dwaara samajhane kii cheshtaa karnaa avichaar he
 According to the statement of Megadugal Mahasya, just as physical science has its own methods of thinking and special methods, in the same way, it has its own methods and methods of thinking about consciousness
 atev chetana ke vishay main bhautik vigyaan kii vidhiyon se na to sochaa ja saktaa he or na uske pradutt iske kaam main aa sakate hai
 Then physics itself has not been able to publish a definite opinion about the nature of its final units which are the basis of that science
 padaarth, shakti, gati aadi ke vishay main abhi tak kaamchalaoo jaankaree ho saki he
 The final decision has not been taken yet about his appearance
 atev chetana ke vishay main antim nirnay kii aashaa kar lenaa yuktisangat nahin he
 Explaining consciousness through unconscious elements, that is, adding a work-cause relationship to it, is downright indiscriminate
 chetana ko jin manovaigyanikon ne jad padaarth kii kriyaaon ke parinaam ke rup main samajhane kii cheshtaa kii he arthath jinhone ise shaareerik kriyaaon, snaayuon ke spandan aadi kaa parinaam mana he, unhone chetana kii upasthiti ko hi samaapt kar diya he
 He has eliminated the presence of consciousness
 pavalaaf or watasan mahoday ke chintan kaa yahi parinaam hua he
 According to his statement, thinking about mind or consciousness in psychology is futile
 manovigyaan kaa vishay manushya kaa drishyman vyavhaar hi hona chahie
 Psychologists have different opinions about the relationship in the body of consciousness
 kuch ke anusaar manushya ke brihat mastishk main honevaali kriyaaon, arthath kuch naadiyon ke spandan kaa parinaam hi chetana he
 It is not an independent element in itself
 dusron ke anusaar chetana swayan tatv he or uskaa sharir se aapasi sambandh he, arthath chetana main honevaali kriyaayein sharir ko prabhavit karti hai
 Sometimes the body is not affected by the actions of consciousness and sometimes the actions of the body do not affect consciousness
 ek mat ke anusaar sharir chetana ke kaary karne kaa yantra maatr hai, jise vah kabhi upyog main laati he or kabhi nahin laati
 But if the device deteriorates, or breaks down, then consciousness becomes crippled for its work
 kuch gambhir manovaigyanik vichaarkon dwaara vigyaan kii vartmaan pragati kii avasthaa main uparyukt mat hi sarvottam mana gaya he
 Three levels of consciousness are considered: conscious, subconscious and unconscious
 chetan str par ve sabhi baaten rahati hai jinke dwaara ham sochate samajhate or kaary karte hai
 Man's ego remains in consciousness and here is the organization of thoughts
 avchetan str main ve baaten rahati hai jinka gyaan hamen tatkshan nahin rahata, parantu samay par yaad kii ja sakati hai
 In the unconscious level, there are things which we have forgotten and which we do not remember even after our hard work and through special process which are reminded
 jo anubhutiyaan ek baar chetana main rahati hai, ve hi kabhi avchetan or achetan man main chali jaati hai
 These sensations are not completely passive, but continue to affect humans inadvertently
 chetana saamaajik vaataavaran ke sampark se viksit hoti he
 Man gets morality, justification and tact from the influence of environment
 ise chetana kaa vikaas kaha jaataa he
 At the height of development, consciousness realizes freedom
 vah saamaajik baton ko prabhavit kar sakati he or unase prabhavit hoti he, parantu is prabhaav se apane aapako alag bhi kar sakati he
 This kind of feeling of consciousness is addressed with the words pure Chaitanya or Pramata, Atma etc

 video 1266 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ

 Airplanes were dispatched, while Pakistan sent less than 50 aircraft

 champaner gaanv kaa nivasee bhuvan ek hausalamand or adarshavaadi noujvaan he
 He was not formed with Captain Russell, the commander of the British cantonment of the Central Provinces
 angrezon ne jab saal kaa lagaan doogana vasuulne kaa aadesh diya tab raja puuran singh se lagaan maaf karwaane kii vinati karne gaanvvaale bhuvan ke saath british chhavnee gayi
 There the king was watching the game of British officers playing cricket
 jab ek afasar ne ek gaanvvasi ko gaali di to bhuvan afasaron se jhagarh pada or cricket ke khel kii barabari gilli-danda se kii
 In front of the king, Bhuvan lodged his protest against harsh rent
 captain rassal ko yah pasand nahi aayaa or usne bhuvan ko cricket khilne kii chunauti di
 Forgive the year's revenue if you win, lose three times the rent !!! The villagers wanted to face this challenge, but Captain Russell only gave this decision in the hands of Bhuvan
 chunauti ko or badhaate, teen saal kaa lagaan maaf karne kaa bhi laalach de diya
 Bhuvan accepted the invitation to fight on the ground
 ab sara champaner maano bhuvan ko suuli par chadhaana chahta tha
 Everyone's life was going to be destroyed now
 magar bhuvan ke liye to jab tak saans tab tak aas
 The drought was going on for many years
 aakhir ek saal kaa lagaan bhi to kahaan se bharte? or phir captain rasal bhi to chunauti se nahin hatane vaale the
 Receiving Bhuvan, he made a wooden bat and ball
 kuch gine-chune logon kaa dal chhodkar, sara gaanv bhuvan ke khel par hans rahaa tha
 This team started to go to the camp secretly after learning of cricket
 vahaan captain rasal kii bahan olizabath ne unako jhaadeeyon main chhipe dekh liya
 He did not like his brother's dealings with the villagers
 vah gaanv ke khilaadiyon ko gaanv ke najadik maidan par cricket sikhaane lagi
 a servant would also bring with him from the cantonment for Hindi translation
 dhire-dhire, sahaj-sahaj, bhuvan kaa ye dal apane apurv dhang se cricket kaa khel seekhney lagi
 They used to cut wood to strengthen their hands
 filding seekhney murgiyon kaa peechha kar unhe pakadtey
 The bullet began to bowl, twisting its hands like a windmill
 ab gaanv ke logon main bhi utsaah dikhne laga or akhir das khiladi to ban gayi
 One day while playing, the ball fell near the trash
 kachra gaanv kaa achhut safaai sevak tha
 When returning, he swung the ball like this and stunned Bhanki
 gaanv kii team ko gyarahavaan chayan mil gaya
 But how would the village adopt an untouchable? They do not even touch it
 gaanv or sadiyon se chali is parampara kii bhuvan ne aalochana kii
 The residents of the village agreed with Bhuvan's heartfelt words
 akhir muqaabale kaa din jaagaa
 People came from all over the province to watch the game
 captain rasal ke varisht afsar bhi maujuud the
 The game was decided for three days
 gaanvvasion ne pehle gend fankna shuru kiya
 He had a good beginning
 jald hi ek ranaute se vikat giri
 Another blonde player was out after being stunned by the unique ball of the shot
 magar british khilaadi bhi kam na the
 Slowly he continued to handle the innings
 achaanak kachra gend ghumaane se rahaa
 Lakha also lost many catches
 pehle din ke ant main gori toli haaavee thi
 That night, Elizabethan saw Lakha meeting Captain Rasel in the camp
 ab pataa chalaa kii lakh gaanvvaalon se gaddari kar rahaa tha
 Alizabath used to train the villagers with Cricet, he told this to Captain Rasel
 yah bhi bataaya kii kach bhi jaanboojh kar gawaae
 When the villagers came to know, they wanted to remove the skin of Lakha
 unse bhaag nikle lakh ne gaanv ke mandir main panaah lee
 Lakha confessed that he was deceived by jealousy of Bhuvan
 vah bhi bhuwan kii tarah gauri ko chahta tha magar gauri bhuvan ko pasand karti thi
 One chance and Lakha were given
 agle din lakh ne zabardast kach kiye
 Garbage also started running its magic again
 us ne ek saath teen gendon main teen vikaten lee
 The Whites' innings ended at about three runs
 bhuvan kii toli ne ballebaazi kii joardaar shuruuaat kii
 Deva, a former soldier of the British army, was dismissed from the commission
 phir british khilaadion ne gaanv ke ballebzon kii ninda kar unako akulaayaa or ve jald out hone lage
 The second day ended and the half-runs were yet to be scored
 udhar aadhi team out ho chuki thi
 But Bhuvan was still alive in the game
 tisare din gaanv ke baid ishwar kaaka ne or ismail ne bhuvan kaa saath diya
 Ismail was hurt the previous day
 bahut javaabdari se dono ne ballebaazi kii
 Both were run-out
 ab kachra ne ballebaazi sanbhali
 Bhuvan tried very hard to handle more batting
 akhrari gend par kachra ko chha rano kii zarurat thi
 But he was able to take only one run
 kya gaanvvaale haare? ampaire ne no-ball kaa ishaara kiya
 Now Bhuvan faced another ball
 bhuwan ne chakka maaraa or gaanv muqaabala jeet gaya
 And it also started raining
 captain rassal ko unke varishton ne madhya afarika bhej diya
 Alizabeth Bath returned
 rote rote bhuvan or gaanv ke logon se usne bidaai lee
 At the end of the film, a voice-over tells that Captain Russell's changed Africa and that Elizabethan whole life was considered as Radha of Bhuvan
 bhuwan or gauri kaa vivaah ho gaya

80 crores rupee Aandhi Toofan is a 1985 Hindi language film
 chand shabd anek arthon main prayukt kiya jaataa he
 "chhandas" is a synonym of Veda
 saamanytah varnon or matraaon kii geyavyavastha ko chand kaha jaataa he
 The word verse is also used in the same sense
 padya adhik vyapak arth main prayukt hota he
 In the language, words and words have letters and vowels
 inhen ko ek nishchit vidhaan se suvyavasthit karne par chand kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Chhandashastra is therefore considered to be a very strong scripture because it is based on mathematics
 vastut: dekhne par aisa prathit hota he ki chandashastra kii rachana isaliye kii gai jisase agrim santati iske niyamon ke aadhaar par chhandrachana kar sake
 It is also known from looking at the scriptures of the verses that while on the one hand the Acharya continued to develop the verses through the prasasti, on the other hand, the poets, while changing a few verses on their own behalf, created new verses, which in the texts of the verses of time, Incorporated
 chandashastra kii rachana kab hui, is sambandh main koi nishchit vichaar nahin diya ja saktaa
 Legend has it that Maharishi Valmiki is a primordial poet and his poetry called Ramayana is primordial
 maa nishad pratishtha tvan gam: shashwati samaa: yatkronchamithunadekamvadhi:, kammohitan - yah anushtup chand valmiki ke mukh se niklaa hua pratham chand he jo shok ke kaaran sahasaa shloke ke rup main prakat hua
 If this legend is to be believed, the verses were composed first and the verses came after that
 valmikiy ramayana main anushtup chand kaa prayog adyopant hua hi he, anya upjati aadi kaa bhi prayog prachur maatra main praapt hota he
 Another legend is that the original inventor of the scripture is God
 ek baar garud ne unhen pakad liya
 Sheshi said that we have a unique learning which you should learn, then eat us
 garud ne kaha ki aap bahaane banaate hai or swaraksharth hamen vibhramit kar rahe hai
 Sheshi replied that we do not make untrue speech
 isapar garud ne sweekaar kar liya or shesh unhen chandashastra kaa upadesh karne lage
 Describing the verses of various verses, at the end, the rest stated the rule of "bhujangaprayati", and soon entered the sea
 garud ne isapar kaha ki tumne hamen dhokhaa diya, shesh ne uttar diya ki hamane jane ke purv aapako soochna de di
 The quadrilateral form Bhujangaprayati means Bhujang Prayat verses from four ganas and is used
 is prakaar chandashastra kaa aavirbhaav hua
 It appears from this
 ki chandashastra ek daivi vidya ke rup main prakat hua
 Thus it can also be said that its inventor was Sheshacharya, named Sheshi, who does not have any special knowledge and information about it at this time
 iske pashchaat kaha jaataa he ki shesh ne avatar lekar pingalacharya ke rup main chandsutra kii rachana kii, jo pingalashastra kaha jaataa he
 This book is written in sutra style and is available till this time
 isapar tikaayen tathaa vyakhyaayein ho chuki hai
 This is considered to be the first book of the scriptures
 iske pashchaat is shaastra par sanskrit sahitya main anek granthon kii rachana hui
 The authors of the verses can be divided into two categories: the Acharya category, which gives a classical representation of the verses and the poet category, which presents separate works on the verses
 thode samay ke pashchaat ek lekhak shrenee or prakat hui jinamein aise lekhak aate hai jo chhandon ke niyamadikon kii vivechna apni ore se karte hai kintu udhaaharan duusare ke rache hue tathaa prachlit anshon se uddhrut karte hai
 In Hindi too, many texts have been written on Chhandasastra
 chandashastra main mukhya vivechy vishay do hai : There are mainly two types of verses: jinka prayong vedon main praapt hota he
 These include the four types of vowels, namely "anushtupa", such as Harsva, Long, Plut and Swarna
 vaidic chand apaurushey maane jate hai
 They are used under murder, but in fact the proverbial verses are those verses which are propagated in the general public or community
 ye chand kisi nishchit niyam par aadhaarit na hokar visheshat: taal or lay par hi aadhaarit rahete hai, isaliye inaki rachana saamaanya apathit jan bhi kar lete hai
 Cosmic verses refer to those verses that are composed on the basis of certain rules and which are used by well-versed poets in poetry
 in loukik chhandon ke rachana-vidhi-sambandhi niyam suvyavasthit rup se jis shaastra main rakhe gaye hai use chandashastra kehete hai
 The verses are divided on the basis of characters and quantities
 chand prathmat: do prakaar ke maane gaye he : varnik or maatrik
 The number of circles in these remains fixed
 iske do bhi prakaar hai- ganaatmak or aganaatmak
 The negative verses are also called circles
 inaki rachana teen laghu or deergh ganon se bane hue ganon ke aadhaar par hoti he
 If the arrangement of letters is arranged with the idea of short and long, eight forms are formed
 inhen ko "aath gana" kehete hai inamen bha, na, m, ya shubh gana maane gaye hai or ja, r, sa, t ashubh maane gaye hai
 The use of the first four ganas in the beginning of a sentence is appropriate, the use of the last four is prohibited
 yadi ashubh ganon se prarambh honevaale chand kaa hi prayog karnaa he, devatavachi yaa mangalvaachi varna athwa shabd kaa prayog pratham karnaa chahie - isse gandosh dur ho jaataa he
 These ganas are considered to be mutual friends, enemies and indifferent expressions
 chand ke aadi main do ganon kaa mail mana gaya he
 There is also a rule to consider the characters as short and long
 laghu swar athwa ek matraavaale varna laghu athwa hrasv maane gaye or isamen ek maatra maani gai he
 The short letter preceding the combined letters with long vowels is also considered as long and the letter with the discord and the letter of the verse are long
 aganaatmak varnik vrutt ve hai jinamein ganon kaa vichaar nahin rakhaa jaataa, keval varnon kii nishchit sankhya kaa vichaar rahata he vishesh maatrik chhandon main keval matraaon kaa hi nishchit vichaar rahata he or yah ek vishesh lay athwa gati par aadhaarit rahete hai
 Therefore these verses are rhythmic
 varnik chhandon main varna ganon ke hisaab se rakhe jate hai
 The group of three varnas is called gana
 in ganon ke naam hai: yagan, magan, tagan, ragan, jagan, bhagan, nagan or sagan
 Small alone is called 'L' and Guru is called 'C'
 kis gana main laghu-guru kaa kya kram he, yah jaanane ke liye nimnlikhit sutara sahaayak hota he- Seeing the character of the Gan, in this, add the next two letters together and apply the quantities of Gan in the same order, such as: matraaon main jo akeli maatra he, us ke aadhaar par inhen adilaghu yaa aadiguru kaha gaya he
 In which everyone is a Guru, he is called 'magan' Sarvaguru and all are short, 'nagan' is called Sarvalaghu
 sanskrit main adhiktar varnik chhando kaa hi gyaan karaayaa jaataa he; maatrik chhandon kaa kam
 In Sanskrit its name is 'dohadika' verses
 iske visham charnon main teraa-teraa or sam charnon main gyaarah-gyaarah matraayen hoti hai
 In odd feet etc
 
 There should not be this type of quantity-order and at the end there should be gurus and minor characters
 sam charnon kii tuk aapas main milani chahie
 like: is dohe ko pehali pankti main visham or sam donon charnon par matraachihn laga die hai
 Similarly, in the second line also you can put these signs on both the steps
 atah doha ek ardhasam maatrik chand he
 There are 28 quantities in each stage in Harigitika verses and at the end there should be mini and then Guru Varna
 isamen yeti 16 tathaa 12 matraaon ke baad hoti hai; jaise Each phase in this verse has twenty-six volumes and is followed by 14 and 12 quantities
 jaise: The division of verses is based on different numbers of phantoms of quantities and characters
 is prakaar chand sam, visham, ardhasam hote he
 In even stanzas, the varna varsha remains the same in all four phases of the stanza
 ardhasam main pratham, tritiy or dwitiya tathaa chaturth main varnaswar sankhya samaan rahati he
 The number of letters and vowels in all the four phases of the odd stanza remains uneven
 ye varna paraspar pruthak hote hai varnon or matraaon kii kuch nishchit sankhya ke pashchaat bahusankhyak varnon ou swaron se yukt chand dandak kahe jate he
 Their number is very high
 chando kaa vibhaajan phir anya prakaar se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Independent verses and mixed verses
 swatantra chand ek hi chand vishesh niyam se rachaa hua rahata he
 There are two types of mixed verses: doha or rola ke milaane se dohe ke chaturth charan kii aavriti uske pratham charan ke aadi main kii jaati he or dohe ke praarambhik kuch shabd role ke ant main rakhe jate hai
 The second type of compound verse is "chappay" in which four stages are given by roll and two are given by Ullala
 isiliye ise shatpadi athwa chappay kaha jaataa he
 From his view, it is known that the development of verses is not only on the basis of prevalence but also on the basis of verses-mixing method by poets
 isi prakaar kuch chand kisi ek chand ke vilom rup ke bhav se aae hai jaise dohe kaa vilom soratha he
 It seems that poets have often made new verses by converting them into two verses or by increasing the volume in the same verse
 yah chand prastaar ke antargat aa saktaa he
 a phase of larger verses, except for short verses, when it cannot be read at once, determines the place where the composition stops
 is viramsthal ko yeti kehete hai
 With the idea of yeti, verses again become of two types - chand main sangeet tatv dwaara laalitya kaa puraa vichaar rakhaa gaya he
 Often all the verses become lyrical in one form or the other
 raag or raagini vaale sabhi pad chhandon main nahin kahe ja sakate
 That is why certain posts are composed under the name "geeti"
 praaia: sangitatmak padon main swar ke aaroh tathaa avaroh main bahudhaa laghu varna ko deergh, deergh ko laghu or alp laghu bhi kar liya jaataa he
 Short forms of vowels like long a and o are sometimes used in Hindi verses

 International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories
 
 adhikansh deshon main, yah sakal gharelu utpaada ke mahatvapurn ansh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 While international trade has been present for most of its history, its economic, social and political importance has begun to increase in recent centuries
 antarrashtriya vyapaar vyavastha par audyogikaran, unnat parivahan, vaishvikaran, bahurashtriya nigam or bahyasrot se kaarynishpaadan, in sabhi kaa vyapak prabhaav padataa he
 Increasing international trade is important for the continuation of globalization
 antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bina, desh sirf apni khud kii seemaa ke bheetar utpaadit maal or sevaaon tak simit rah jaaenge
 International trade is no different from domestic trade in principle because the motivation and behavior of the parties involved in a trade does not change fundamentally, regardless of whether the trade is cross-border or not
 mukhya antar yah he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar aam taur par gharelu vyapaar se adhik mahangaa he
 The reason for this is that a border usually imposes additional charges such as tariffs, periodic costs due to delays on the border and costs associated with country variations such as language, legal system or culture
 gharelu or antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bich ek or antar yah he ki puunji or shram jaise utpaadan kaarak aam taur par baahar kii tulana main deshon ke bheetar adhik gatisheel hote hai
 Thus international trade is mostly limited to the trade of goods and services and only on a small scale in trade of capital, labor or other factors of production
 In addition, trade in goods and services can act as a substitute for trade in production factors
 utpaadan kaa ek kaarak aayaat karne ke bajaay, ek desh maal aayaat kar saktaa he jo utpaadan ke kaarak kaa gahan istemaal kare or is prakaar sambandhit kaarak ko sammilit kar le
 ek udhaaharan he, china se sanyukt rajya america dwaara shram-pradhan vastuon kaa aayaat
 chini shram kaa aayaat karne ke bajaay america, china se aise maal aayaat kar rahaa he jise chini shram ke istemaal se utpaadit kiya gaya he
 International trade is also a branch of economics, which together with international finance forms the broad branch of international economics
 vyapaar kii paddati kaa purvanumaan lagane or prashulk jaisi vyapaar nitiyon ke prabhaav kaa vishleshan karne ke liye anek alag namoonay prastaavit kiye gaye hai
 The Ricardian model focuses on comparative advantage and is perhaps the most important concept in international trade theory
 ek ricardian model main, desh un chizon ke utpaadan main visheshgyata hasil karte hai jin chizon kaa utpaadan ve acha karte hai
 Unlike other models, the Ricardian framework predicts that countries will specialize instead of producing a wide range of goods
 iske alaava, ricardian model kaarak nidhi par sidhe vichaar nahin karata, jaise desh ke bheetar shram or puunji kii saapeksh maatra
 ricardin model kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki yah deshon ke bich praudyogiki bhinnataaon kii kalpana karata he
 The technology gap is easily incorporated into the Ricardian and ricardo-sraffa models
 ricardian model nimnlikhit anumaan lagaataa he: The Ricardian model makes short-term measurements, so the technology varies internationally
 yah is tathy kaa samarthan karata he ki desh apane tulanaatmak laabh kaa paalan karte hai or visheshgyata ke liye anumati dete hai
 The Ricardian business model was studied by Graham, Jones, Mackenzie and others
 sabhi siddhanton main madhyavarti maal, vasteen or puunjigat maal jaise vyapaarit input maal ko baahar rakhaa gaya
 mckenzie, Jones, and Samuelson emphasized that considerable profits would be lost by the exclusion of intermediate goods from trade
 In a famous comment Mackenzie stated that "the idea of a moment would explain to a person that Lancashire would be unlikely to produce cotton cloth if cotton had to be grown in England
" haal hi main, is siddhant ko vistaarit karte hue isamen vyapaarik madhyavarti maamle ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 Thus the "labor only" assumption was removed from the theory
 is prakaar nayaa ricardian siddhant, jise kabhi-kabhi ricardo-srapha model kaa naam bhi diya jaataa he, saidhantik rup se puunjigat vastuon ko shaamil karata he jaise mashine or samagriyaan, jinka deshon ke bich kaarobaar hota he
 In times of global trade, this assumption is more realistic than the heckscher-olin model, which assumes that capital is stable within the country and not internationally dynamic
 1900 ke dashak ke armbh main, do swedish arthshaastriyon, eli heksher or bertil olin ne kaarak anupaat siddhant naam ke ek antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant kaa srijan kiya
 This theory is also called the heckscher-olin theory
 heksher-olin siddhant is baat par jor detaa he ki deshon ko aise maal kaa utpaadan or niryaat karnaa chahie jise aise sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho, jo prachur hon or aise maal kaa aayaat karnaa chahie jise alp-aapurti vaale sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho
 This theory differs from the theories of comparative advantage and absolute advantage because these theories focus on the productivity of the production process for a particular commodity
 iske vipareet, heksher-olin siddhant kahata he ki ek desh ko utpaadan or niryaat main un karkon kaa upyog karte hue visheshgy hona chahie jo sabase prachur maatra main hon or isliye saste hon
 un maal kaa utpaadan naa karen, jaisaa ki pehle ke siddhanton ne kaha, jo ve sabase adhik kushalta se utpaadit karte hai
 The Heckscher – Olin model was constructed as an alternative to the Ricardian model of basic comparative advantage
 isaki adhik jatilta ke baavjood yah apane purvanumaanon main adhik sateek sabit nahin hua
 But from a theoretical point of view it provides an elegant solution by incorporating neo-classical value mechanisms into international trade theory
 is siddhant kaa tark he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar kaa pattern, kaarak nidhi main antar se nirdhaarit hota he
 It predicts that countries will export goods that use locally abundant factors and will import goods that use factors that are locally scarce
 H-O model ke saath anubhavjanya samasyaayein, jise leontiff virodhabhas ke rup main janaa jaataa he, wesile leontiff dwaara anubhavjanya pareekshanon main saamne ain jinhone paaya ki puunji kii bahutayat hone ke baavjood america shram-pradhan maalon ko niryaat kar rahaa tha
 The HO model makes the following main assumptions: H-O siddhant ke saath samasya yah he ki yah puunjigat vastuon ke vyapaar ko shaamil nahin karata he 
H-O siddhant main, shram or puunji, prayek desh ke liye sthir padaarth hai
 In a modern economy, capital goods are traded internationally
 madhyavarti vastuon ke vyapaar se laabh kaaphi hota hai, jaisaa ki samuelson dwaara bal diya gaya tha 
 Many economists prefer the Heckscher – Olin theory than the Ricardo theory, as it makes less straightforward assumptions
 1953 main, wesile leontiff ne ek adhyayan prakashit kiya, jahaan unhone heksher-olin siddhant kii vaidhata kaa pareekshan kiya
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki anya deshon kii tulana main america puunji main adhik prachur tha, isliye america puunji-pradhan maal kaa niryaat kar rahaa tha or shram-pradhan maal kaa aayaat
 leontiff ne paaya ki aayaat kii tulana main america kaa niryaat kam puunji-pradhan tha
 After the Leontief paradox emerged, many researchers tried to save the heckscher-olin theory, either by new methods of measurement, or by new interpretations
 Leamer emphasized that Leontief did not correctly interpret the HO theory and claimed that contradiction did not occur with a correct interpretation
 brechar or choudri ne paaya ki, agar limar sahi tha, to america mazaduron kii prati vyakti khapat, mazdooron ke vishwa ausat khapat se kam honi chahie
 Later several other tests took place but most of them failed
 kai prasiddh pathyapustak lekhak, jinamein shaamil hai krugman or obstfeld or boven, holender or vien, H-O model kii vaidhata ke bare main nakaaratmak hai
 
 After testing a long history of empirical research, Bowen, Hollander, and VN concluded: "recent tests of the factor abundance theory that directly examine the HOV equations also indicate a rejection of the theory"
 : 321 heksher-olin siddhant ko dakshin-uttar vyapaar samasyaon kaa vishleshan karne ke liye acchhee tarah anukulit nahin kiya gaya he
 Estimates of HO are less realistic regarding NS than NN trade
 uttar or dakshin ke bich aay bhinnata hi ek aisi chiz he jisaki teesri duniya ko sabase zyada parvaah hoti he
 The factor price equalization has not shown much sign of recovery
 HO model maanata he ki deshon ke bich samaan utpaadan kaary karata he
 This is very unrealistic
 viksit or vikasshil deshon ke bich praudyogiki kii bhinnata, garib deshon ke liye chintaa kaa mukhya vishay he
 In this model, labor mobility between industries is possible, while capital is stable between industries in the short term
 is prakaar, is model ko heksher-olin model ke ek 'alpakaaleen' sanskaran ke rup main vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 The specific factor name refers to what is provided, in the short term, specific factors of production such as physical capital are not easily transferable between industries
 siddhant yah suzav detaa he ki agar maal kii keemat main vruddhi hoti he, to us maal ke vishisht sandarbh main utpaadan ke kaarak ke maalikon ko vaastavik rup se acha laabh hoga
 In addition, owners of specific factors of anti-production are likely to have opposing agendas when they seek favors to control labor immigration
 iske vipareet, puunji or shram, donon ke maalikon ko puunji nidhi main vruddhi se vaastavik rup main laabh hota he
 This model is ideal for particular industries
 yah model aay vitaran ko samajhane ke liye adarsh he lekin vyapaar kii paddati kii charchaa karne ke liye bhadda he
 New business theory tries to explain many facts about trade, which is difficult for the two main models outlined above
 isamen yah tathy bhi shaamil he ki zyaadaatar vyapaar, samaan kaarak bandobasti or utpaadakta str or maujuud bahurashtriya utpaadan kii badi maatra vaale deshon ke bich hota he

 These trade agreements, coupled with unfair trade claims that are not profitable for developing countries, have often led to protests and dissatisfaction

 Regulation of international trade is done globally through the World Trade Organization and through many other regional arrangements such as MERCOSUR in South America, the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, and European between 27 independent countries Union

 Of particular importance is the role of governments in deciding whether they will allow international businesses to setup their operations and encourage them to grow and succeed
 aksar, kai deshon kii sarkaron ke liye ek vikalp nahin he lekin antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat karne ke rup main ve "nakadi" yaa dollar kii jarurat he, kyonki ve bhi janaa jaataa he
 For example, the difference between exports and imports is known as current account deficit or CAD

 Then, governments can borrow losses at high rates or finance losses through FDI or foreign direct investment and equity flows from fiis or foreign institutional investors to the stock markets
 iske alaava, gharelu udyog kshamtaaon ko ek vishesh kshetra he or na hi visheshgyata he ki kshetra kaa vikaas karne main safal hone ke liye nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, FDI becomes necessary for the development of that region

 For this reason, many governments in developing countries are doing something to encourage and allow foreign investment in international businesses to operate the setup in their respective countries

 The important aspect here is that many governments in emerging economies often welcome international businesses with open arms because of the above reasons
 haalanki, bich main hi prakriya ke madhyam se, unamem se kuch nitigat pakshaaghaat kii vajah se thand pair viksit karne, or karkon se upar soochibaddh he
 It is understandable that allowing international businesses to enter emerging economies needs to be bipartisan meaning that there should be a broad consensus on the issue from all stakeholders

 In addition, competition for foreign capital is so intense that the process in an adverse economy and therefore, the process must be continued and the reason given incentives affect international businesses

 Under 'adigranth', apart from the first five gurus of Sikhs, there are the statements of their ninth Guru and 14 'bhagats'
