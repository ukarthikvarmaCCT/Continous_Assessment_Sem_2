 Lb) in the game of cricket is a method of dismissing a batsman
 ek ampire paristhitiyon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke antargat ek ballebaaj ko elbeadblyoo out qaraar detaa he, jab mukhyatah ballebaaj ke wicket se takaraa sakane vaali gend ballebaaj ke sharir se takaraati he
 The LBW rule was created so that the batsman does not use the body in place of his bat to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket
 elbeadblyoo ko saamanytah is khel ke sabase jatil niyam ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Despite the use of leg in the term leg before wicket, this rule applies even if the ball hits the batsman's other part of the body except for the bat's hand gloves
 elbeadblyoo kaa niyam 1744 tak cricket ke niyamon main shaamil nahin tha
 This rule was first used in 1774, according to which: If the batsman is considered out


 or else the batsman will stick his leg in front of the wicket to stop the ball and stop the ball from hitting the wicket
 jabaki elbeadblyoo niyam ke prayog kii shuruyaat nishchit rup se ballebaaj dwaara gend ko wicket se na takaraane dene ke liye jaanboojh kar taang va pair adaane ke kaaran hui thi, jon nairen jaise shuruaati lekhakon ne jaanboojh kar kiye jane vaale is kaam ke liye tom tailor tathaa joe ring ko jimmedaar mana he
 However, his career began after 1774 and, as Arthur Hegarth points out, "it is now impossible to reconcile these conflicting statements"
 isi vajah se elbeadblyoo ke niyam ko kai varshon tak record nahin kiya gaya tha
 John Toughton was dismissed by John Wells under LBW rule in the match of Surrey v England XI at Moulsey Hurst in August 1795
 hegarth ke anusaar: is match main, pehali baar aisa paaya gaya ki "pagabaadha" ko darj kiya gaya he 
brishar kii mudrit score-pustika main, is match main mi
 je
 tafton ko keval bold qaraar diya gaya he, tathaa note main pagabaadha likhaa gaya he
 In the beginning, when any batsman was out in this manner, it was only written that he was bowled and not pugged
 sankshep main is niyam kaa saar yah he: If the ball hits the batsman who was about to hit the wicket, it is called LBW, unless: dhyaan den: leg said se baahar padane vaali gendon se abhipraay yah he ki gend kaa pachaas pratishat yaa isse adhik hissaa leg stump ke baahar avashya hona chahie
 In addition, the ball hitting the batsman outside the off-stump must have a fifty percent or more hit against the batsman outside the off-stump line
 apni jatiltaaon ke baavjood, kaich evam bold ke pashchaat pagabaadha ) cricket main out karne kaa sabase saamaanya prakaar he
 Following are the conditions for declaring a batsman LBW: in sthitiyon kii vyakhya karne ke teen niyam hai: ke apwaad main ampaire kaa yah nirnay shaamil hota he ki ballebaaj ne gend ko maarane kaa prayaas kiya he athwa nahin
 This rule has been made so that the batsman does not just play the ball outside the off-stump on the pad, which eliminates the possibility of hitting the ball with the bat
 spin gendbaajon ke khilaaf ek aam rakshaatmak ranneeti of stump par gend se bachane ke liye pad kaa istemaal karnaa he, kintu elbeadblyoo niyam kaa matlab he ki unka balla pad ke najadik ho, jisase slip main khadey kshetrarakshakon ko kaich pakadaney kaa mauka mili, yaa unke elbeadblyoo out hone kii sambhaavna bane
 Some reviewers, such as Richie Bainod, have suggested that the LBW rule should be changed in such a way that the batsman can be called out even if he is slightly out of the leg stump, which will help the legspiners and avoid negative pad-play
 elbeadblyoo niyam kii samiksha hameshaa gendbaaj ke chor par khadey ampire dwaara kii jaati he
 If the fielding team believes that a batsman can be out lbw, they should request the umpire for a decision
 gend, jisase ballebaaj tak pahunchane main aadhe second kaa samay lagata he, ke liye sabhi elbeadblyoo sthitiyon kaa moolyankan kiya janaa chahie
 As in other aspects of the rules, the batsman is always given the benefit of any doubt, therefore, if the umpire is not satisfied, the request will be turned down
 For example if the batsman steps one before the ball hits the batsman
 Goes ahead
 ho saktaa he gend aage chal kar wicket se takaraa jaati, kintu ek ampaire ke liye is bare main sunishchit hona bahut mushkil he kyonki ballebaaj kii taang se takaraate samay gend wicket se 1
5-2 meter kii duuri par hogi
 Through television replays it is now easy to tell whether all the conditions of LBW were met and therefore some people complain that an umpire wrongly asked the batsman to continue the game or that he was wrongly Dubbed out
 haalanki ampire dwaara kisi ballebaaj ko out dene se pehle is bare main sunishchit hona chahie ki vah out he ki nahin or chunki unke paas tivi riple jaisi koi suvidha nahin hoti, atah ampire kaa nirnay aamtaur par uchit hota he
 Most players and commentators accept this decision and there is little criticism from umpires
 yakeenan elbeadblyoo kaa nirnay ampiron dwaara kiye jane vaale nirnyon main se sabase kathin he or yah darshakon ke bich tippanee or vivaad kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 In recent years, due to the increasing pressure in cricket and the money at stake, many have been emphasizing the role of cameras in uncertain cases and the use of simulation techniques such as the hawk-eye
 philhal, elbeadblyoo ek aisa nirnay he jo keval maidan par khadey ampaire dwaara liya jaataa he
 However, the wind has changed: In September 2005, the International Cricket Council authorized a test by umpires to aid decision-making through television replays
 
 It is worth noting that if the ball hits the pad first and then hits the bat, the batsman can be declared out lbw but if the batsman hits the ball with the bat and after that the ball hits his pad, The batsman cannot be declared out in that case
 haalanki, donon hi maamalon main, ek ballebaaj dwaara kaich out hone kaa khatra bana rahata he kyonki gend apekshaakrit dhimi gati se uchhal kar najdiki kshetrarakshak dwaara lapki ja sakati he
 If the ball hits the batsman without breaking, then in that case the umpire has to guess the direction of the ball by its speed and bounce, ignoring any possible deviations after the ball has been hit
 haalanki gend wicket se takaraayegi yaa nahin, yah nirdhaarit karne se pehle ampaire gend ke swing yaa pravaah ko dhyaan main rakh saktaa he
 If the ball is swinging, the umpire is allowed to guess whether the ball will swing in the same direction or not
 ek galatafahami he ki ballebaaj us sthiti main elbeadblyoo out nahin ho saktaa jab gend leg stump ke baahar tappa khaati he
 It is generally believed that a ball hitting the outside of the leg stump will result in a not out, however there is an exception in an unusual situation, according to the LBW law's exact definition and the current definition of no ball
 24
6 niyam ke tahat, ek gend ko tabhi vaid gend mana jayega agar yah do baar uchle
 36
1 niyam main kaha gaya he ki yadi, "tappa padane se pehle ise na rokane par, gend wicket se wicket ke bich sidhi rekha main yaa ballebaaj kii of said kii wicket se takaraati he" to us sthiti main ballebaaj elbeadblyoo out he
 "it is worth noting here that, in Rule 36
1, there is no mention of the leg side, nor does it state that such a condition occurs more than once
 Thus a ball that bounces twice may result in lbw
 Even if it is out of the line of a tapped leg stump
 No batsman has been dismissed in this manner in international cricket
 elbeadblyoo ek shabd he jiskaa prayog 21 navambar 1934 ko mericabone cricket club dwaara banaaye gaye pagabaadha niyam main badlaav kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 It came into existence in England in 1935, but was opposed by higher level officials in Australia where it did not apply until the 1936 / 1937 season, although it was implemented in club matches during the 1935 / 1936 season in Australia
 Was tried to do
 is badlaav ke anusaar of stump se baahar tappa padane par bhi elbeadblyoo out ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he yadi wicket se wicket ke bich kii sidhi rekha main ballebaaj ise apane sharir ke kisi hisse se roktaa he
 Earlier, LBW could be dismissed only by the balls falling in the straight line between the bowler's end and the batsman's wickets
 shabd "elbeadblyoo " is tathy ko sanderbhit karata he ki 1935 se 1937 tak vijden dwaara prakashit scorcardon main nae pagabaadha niyam dwaara liye gaye wicket 1935 ke pehle ke niyamon ke viketon se alag darshaae gaye the
 During the 1920s and 1930s the characteristic of first-class cricket was the increasing dominance of the bowlers by the batsmen

 It was clear to the officials that the batsmen who played good pad play like Herbert Sutcliffe and Phil Mead were responsible for the high runs and the increasing number of draw matches
 atah of stump se baahar padane vaali gendon ko pad dwaara rokane se bachaane kaa uddeshy na keval pad play kaa muqabla karnaa tha balki of stump par gend daalane vaale gendbaajon ko puraskrit karke tej "bodiline " gendbaaji ko hatotsahit karnaa bhi tha or isi kaaran of said main aakarshak stroke khilne ko protsaahan mila
 It was heavily scrutinized in 1934 and it was generally agreed that an extension of the LBW rule on the off side could reduce defensive pad play
 herold larwood jaise kuch logon ne of stump se bahaar padane vaali kisi bhi gend par elbeadblyoo qaraar die jane kii maang kii, bhale hi ballebaaj ke pair bhi of stump se baahar hi kyon na hon - jise 1970 ke baad se hi kuch had tak mana gaya he

 rajanyik itihaas se aashay rajyon ke bich antararashtriya sambandhon ke itihaas se he
 But diplomatic history is different from international relations in the sense that under international relations, the relations of two or more states are studied while diplomatic history can be related to the foreign policy of a single state
 rajanyik itihaas kaa jhukaav adhikanshtah rajnay ke itihaas kii ore hota he jabaki antararashtriya sambandh samasamyik ghatnaon par adhik dhyaan detaa he
 Diplomacy is an art which the state of the world adopts to enhance its mutual relations and serve its interests
 rajnay ke suparibhaashit lakshya tathaa unki siddhi ke liye sthapit kushal yantra ke baad iske vaanchhneeya parinaamon kii uplabdhi un sadhano evam tareekon par nirbhar karti he jinhen ek rajya dwaara apnaane kaa nirnay liya jaataa he
 Other states estimate the actual goals of diplomacy on the basis of these tools
 yadi rajnay ke saadhan tathaa lakshyon ke bich asangati rahati he to isse desh kamjor hota he, badnaam hota he tathaa uski anterrashtriya pratishtha gir jaati he
 With this view, each state should adopt such means which can create goodwill and trust in other states
 iske liye yah aavashyak he ki rajya apni nitiyon ko spasht rup se samajhaaye, duusare rajyon ke nyyochit daavon ko manyata de tathaa eemaandareepurn vyavhaar kare
 Dishonest and tactful diplomats succeed in short term goals but overall they remain at a loss
 duusare rajyon main unke prati avishvaas paidaa hota he tathaa ve sajag ho jate hai
 Hence the importance of diplomatic methods
 rajnay ke sadhano kaa nirnay lete samay yah dhyaan rakhana chaiye ki iskaa mukhya uddeshy rajya ke pramukh hiton kii raksha karnaa he
 The same purpose is also for the diplomacy of other states

 There are also instances in history when one powerful big state forced the other weak state to accept its own arbitrary conditions and instead adopted a path of unilateral compulsion by adopting a process of compromised exchange

 Therefore, he accepted this exploitation in compulsion, but after some time, when he became competent under the leadership of Hitler, he declared all these conditions invalid
 spasht he ki parsparik aadan-pradaan hi sthaayee rajnay kaa aadhaar ban saktaa he
 Relations based on compulsion, dishonesty, deceit, deceit, and strength are short-lived and have opposing effects on the other side

 The development of means and methods of diplomacy is linked to the long history of mutual relations between states

 Accordingly, political behavior has also changed
 vishwa ke vibhinn deshon ke itihaas kaa avlokan karne par yah spasht ho jaataa he ki rajanyik aachaar kaa tarika prayek desh kaa apana vishisht rahaa he
 Here we will study the methods of diplomatic conduct adopted in Greece, Rome, Italy, France and India
 rajnay kaa itihaas unani nagar rajyon se prarambh hota he
 Political philosophers like Plato and Aristotle have written enough about the political situation of the city states and their relationship with other states
 unani sabhyataa ke praarambhik charan main nagar rajyon ke rajdooton ko agradoot kaha jaataa tha
 Their work was not limited only to negotiating treaties, but they also used to do the work of governing the state household, setting up the system in meetings and councils and performing religious ceremonies etc
 unani sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath-saath nagar rajyon ke sambandh jatil evam sparddhapurna ban gayi
 Now for the negotiations, people who are powerful and influential speakers, who have a sharp memory and a loud voice, so that they can present the vision of their city in front of the Lok Sabhas of other city states and can affirm strongly in its favor
 
 rajanyik padon par aise vyakti ko niyukt kiya jane laga jo puratvvetta ek kushal vaktaa, raajnneetik sambandhon kaa vidhyaarthee tathaa manovaigyanik ho
 Reading the descriptions of the famous historian Thucydides, it is known that the statements of the diplomats of that time were sufficiently powerful and long-lived
 isane sparta nivaasiyon kii ek lok sabha kaa vivaran diya he jisamen sahyogiyon evam mitron ko yah tay karne ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya tha ki kya athens rajya ne apni sandhiyon kaa ulanghan kiya he or yadi kiya he to kya iske dand swaroop uske viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di jaye ? is sabha main vaktrutaaon kii samaapti ke baad yuddh kaa prastaav pehle kanth swar se or phir matganana ke aadhaar par paarit ho gaya
 The remarkable thing was that at the same time, the Athens resident delegation had come to Sparta in the context of a trade treaty and was present in the said meeting not being invited
 ise bich-bich main apana mat vyakt karne diya jaataa tha
 When the war resolution was passed, the members of this delegation became citizens of the enemy state, yet they were allowed to remain in Sparta until they had completed their treaty
 unani rajanyajna ye kaary sampann karte the - swagatakartta rajya main sambandhit soochna ekatrit karnaa, lokapriy nagar sabhaaon ke sammukh apane rajya ke hiton ke samarthan main sabhi tareeke apnaanaa, videshi rajya ke sambandh main samayik prativedan taiyaar karnaa, videshi rajya main apane rajya ke nagarikon ke hiton kii raksha karnaa aadi
 At that time, the work done by Thucydides as a diplomat is useful enough for our study
 usne vivaadon ko shantipurvak hal karne ke liye sandhivaarta or sammelanaatmak rajnay ke tareeke apanaaye
 Sparta and Athens were the oldest of the city states
 yahan anya rajyon ke saath sambandhon kii acchhee paramparaayen viksit huin
 Athens was democratic in terms of organization and spirit
 yahan vyapaarik evam samudramargeey sampark kii drushtir se nivaasiyon ko teen bhaagon main vargeekrut kiya gaya-das, videshi niwasakartta or athens ke naagarik
 Its form of contact with other states was democratic
 yahaan kaa rajnay vyapaar, vaanijya or suraksha sambandhi aavashyaktaaon se prabhavit tha
 These city states of Greece gave diplomats many immunities and privileges
 prarambh se hi videsh sambandhon kii rachana main in rajanyikon kaa yogadan na keval mahatvapurn varan vyapak bhi tha
 The mutual relations of the Greek city states gave rise to many customs and principles
 us samay anterrashtriya kanoon apni shishu avasthaa main tha
 Naga states like Athens, Sparta and Thebes developed mutual relations keeping in mind their internal policy, convenience and security related strategy
 aadhunik anterrashtriya sandhiyon ke bich tatkaaleen dharmik or raajnneetik sanghon main dekhe ja sakate he
 At that time, traditions such as the inerrancy of diplomats, the right to asylum, the ceasefire for cremation of the dead and the religious fairs and stopping the tension during play were adopted
 nagar rajyon kii janpriya sabhaaon main videshon se swadansh ke rajdooton dwaara bheje gayi prativednon par aalochanatmak vichaar kiya jaataa tha
 Necessary instructions were given after considering the problems presented by their suggestions
 rajyo ke bich vivaad utpann hone par panch faisle dwaara uske samaadhaan kii paramparaayen pad chuki thim
 With a view to regularizing international life, two processes developed by the Greeks are notable - unani nagar rajyon ke rajanyik vyavhaar ko sankshep main nimna prakaar varnit kiya ja saktaa he- Criticizing Greek period diplomacy, it is sometimes said that the Greeks were unfamiliar with the notion of international morality, without which even the best diplomatic device proved to be inactive, on average, the Greeks' loyalty to the city state was so deep that it Other city states considered the residents as potential slaves and the remaining rude as natural slaves
 rajanyik sambandhon kii vibhinn ullekhneey dharanaon ke hote hue bhi unaniyon kaa rajanyik aachaar kai drushtirayon se doshapurn tha- In short, the Greeks had made considerable progress in the field of diplomatic conduct
 roman log unaniyon kii tulana main adhik barbar the
 Therefore, they could not develop international relations
 unaniyon ne sandhi vaarta paddati ko viksit kiya tha or rajanyik prakriya ke madhyam se virodhiyon se sampark sthapit karne main vishwaas vyakt kiya tha, kintu roman logon ne sainik shakti par adhik vishwaas kiya
 He was more a winner than a diplomat
 roman logon ne rajanyik taur-tareekon ke sthaan par sidhi kaarywahi par adhik vishwaas kiya
 In order to maintain their supremacy, they adopted the method that they would favor the weak in times of conflict between two or more nations, as they believed that this policy would allow both sides to be witnesses of Rome's political grace
 kamjor kaa paksh lene se vah to rome ke prabhaav ko maanegaa hi, kintu kamjor kaa paksh lekar jab shaktishaalee ko ukhaad phanka jaayegaa to vah shaktishaalee paksh bhi rome kaa prabhaav maanane ke liye majaboor ho jaayegaa
 The Romans formulated the principle of legalization of war in the field of diplomacy, according to which according to them, the same war was legalized for which a formal declaration was made and for which religious ceremonies were organized by a particular religious teacher
 roman log yuddh or shanti donon hi kaaryon main videshi raajnneetigyon kaa swaagat karte rahe
 They usually called the ambassador Lagetas and sometimes also Fetial
 yah shabd adhikanshah yuddh athwa shaanti ke liye vaartakar ke saath lagaaya jaataa tha
 The Roman Senate regularly sent its country's ambassadors abroad
 roman kanoon rajdooton ko anatikramyata ko manyata detaa tha
 Eminent political thinker Cicero, who came to Rome as a messenger, wrote in this regard, “the ambiguity of ambassadors is both divine and human laws
 ve pavitra or aardayee hai taaki ve anatikramya bane rahen
 It is not only in the Allies but they are also in the enemy's army
 ”under the Roman law, the ambassador's allies were also infatuated
 rajdooton ke patr-vyavhaar or unke liye anivaary vastuon ko anatikramya samajha jaataa tha
 The ambassador had the privilege of trespassing even when he passed through a third state
 rajdoot par kiya gaya koi bhi hamalaa roman antarajartiya kanoon kaa ulanghan mana jaataa tha
 The principle of territoriality was also applicable to the ambassador, meaning that the ambassador was not prosecuted in the state court for breaking any agreement, he was free from local laws 
 roman seenet rajdooton ko rajkeey atithiyon jaisaa sammaan detii thi
 The Romans provided the method of a trained 'archivist' in the field of diplomacy
 puralekhpal rajanyik drushtaanton or prakriyaaon main praveen vyakti hote the
 Even today, an important branch of diplomacy is to protect and keep old articles, treaties, records etc
 roman logon ne puralekhagaaron athwa lekhon se sambandhit kaary ko ‘rajanyik vyavhaar’ kii sangya di he
 The method of keeping such articles organized is an important contribution of the Roman people
 roman logaan ne rajyon kii samanta ke siddhanth kaa kabhi aadar nahin kiya

 Civil engineering is the oldest branch of engineering after military engineering
 ise sainya ejineering se alag karne ke liye 'asainik ejineering' ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya
 Traditionally, it has been divided into several sub-branches, which include - environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, transportation engineering, municipal or urban engineering, water resources engineering, materials engineering, coastal engineering, surveying and construction engineering
 Civil engineering takes place at every level: from the municipal sector to the federal levels in the public sector and from private house owners to international companies in the private sector

 maanav sansaadhan ke sandarbh main kisi karmchaaree ko kisi duusare karmchaaree ke dwaara pratisthapit karne ko shramavart yaa shram-pratisthaapan kehete hai
 An employee may be separated from an organization for several reasons - expulsion, retirement, death, transfer, resignation, etc
 kisi sanghathan kaa shramavart dar ek nishchit samay main us sanghathan ko chhodane vaale karmchaariyon kii sankhya, karmchaariyon kii kul sankhya ke pratishat ke rup main vyakt kii jaati he, arthath There are many reasons for the rise in labor
 mrityu or avkaash prapti iske do prakritik kaarak hai jiske kaaran shramik kaa uske kaary se algaav hota he
 Also, these places are filled soon so that the production process is not interrupted
 shramikon dwaara kaary se aichhik vaapasi doosraa mahatvapurn kaarak he jo ki shramavart ko badhaata he
 It is expressed in two forms, first as resignation and second as work abandonment
 pratham rup main, shramik kaary se tyaag patr dene kii ichha vyakt karata he or kaary ko chhodane ke iraade ko vyakt karne ke liye prabandhak ko vidhiwat soochna detaa he jabaki duusare rup main vah kaary ko bina bataaye hi chhod detaa he
 Several reasons may be responsible for resignation
 udaahranarth - adhik acchhee naukari mil janaa, santhaan kii sharto kaa manjuur na hona, santhaan ke antargat apamaanit kiya janaa, santhaan kaa anupyukt hona, paariwarik maamalon main ulajh janaa ityadi
 The third important factor is removal
 nishkasana ke liye bhi anek kaarak uttaradaayi ho sakate hai
 For example, demonstrating indiscipline, non-performance of work from a qualitative and quantitative point of view, rebellion against the institute, absence without leave for work, etc
 shramavart ke parinaamon ko ham teen bhaagon main vibhajit kar sakate hai
 We can divide the results of labor in three parts
 pratyaksh parinaam : ve parinaam he jinke antargat naye bhartee kiye gayi shramikon k prashikshan hetu vyay kiye gayi kharch ko sammilit kiya jaataa he, saath hi bhartee kiye jaan main hone vaale chote mote kharche bhi aate hai
 Additional expenditure incurred in relocation: The additional expenditure under this is due to lack of skill of newly recruited workers which affects both qualitative and quantitative forms of production
 naye shramikon ko bhartee karne se purv hone vaale atirikt vyay : yah haani isli hoti he kyonki puraane shramikon ke sthaan par naye shramikon ko bhartee karne main bhi samyaantar ho jaataa he
 Over that period, production falls, causing damage to the institution
 shramavart kii ucch dar audyogic sambandhon evam karmchaariyon main sthirataa or bhakthi bhaavana tathaa vishwasaneeyata utpann karne main sahaayak nahin ho sakati
 The ill effects of labor can only be prevented if the data related to it are collected reliably and in their analysis find factors that have been responsible for high rates of labor in changing circumstances
 audyogic drushti se pragatisheel pashchimi deshon main bahirgaman saakshaatkaar shramavart kii daron ko ghataane ke liye ek kargar yantra ke rup main saamne aayaa he
 Under this, a team is appointed by the Department of Personnel, which is constantly working to determine whether the workers' separation from the institution is voluntary or involuntary
 jab bhi koi tyaag patr praapt hota he, tyaag patr dene vaale shramik kaa saakshaatkaar kiya jaataa he or use is baat kii purna swatantraaa di jaati he ki vah bina kisi bhay or sankoch ke apni bhaawanaaon ko vyakt kar sake
 If the worker leaves the work without notice, it is a continuous effort to establish a relationship with him where it can be found and to try to bring to light the facts that led to the labor leaving the work
 i went
 yadi maamla chantni yaa barkhaastagi kaa he to is baat kii purna pariksha kii jaati he ki jo bhi kaarywahi kii gai he vah shram vidhaanon evam sthaayee adhyadeshon ke pravidhanon k antargat kii gai he yaa nahin
 Such exit interviews provide managers with special understanding and knowledge about the circumstances and reasons under which workers leave the institution
 is prakaar prabandhak is baat kaa nirnay lene main apane ko sakasham paata he ki uske santhaan main shramavart kii unchi dar kaa kaaran kharaab kaary kii paristhitiyon, yaa anya jagahon par uttam kaary kii prapti, prabandh kii shram niti yaa vyavhaar, shramik kii khud kii galtiyaan yaa duracharan, shramik sangh ke netaaon kaa vyavhaar yaa kaary kii neerasata he; in karkon main se koun se kaarak shramavart kii ucch dar ke liye kitna jimmedaar he, or inako samaapt karne ke liye koun sa nirodhatmak upaay apanaaye ja sakate hai
 To test such exit interviews, managers must be given opportunities within their respective institutions to find out the factors of high labor rates and find preventive measures to eliminate them
 is prakriya ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye malika or shramikon kii sanyukt samitiyon kaa gathan prayek santhaan main kiya janaa chahie
 These committees should have representatives of owners and workers
 saath hi in sabkon is disha main sanyukt prayaas karne chahie
 Generally, all the measures which are related to resignation and expulsion should be adopted to reduce the labor force
 tyaag patron ko kam karne ke liye santhaan ke antargat kaary kii sharto evam dashaon main sudhaar karte hue ve sabhi kaary karne honge jisase ki shramik kaary santosh kii bhaavana kaa anubhav kar saken or kisi bhi str par uske aatm sammaan ko thes na pahunche
 The pay scale that a worker can get outside the institute must be paid that much under the institute
 nishkasana ko kam karne ke liye shramikon main kaary tathaa santhaan ke prati bhakthi bhaavana ko badhaate hue ashasanheenata ko kam karnaa hoga
 For this, managers, inspectors and colleagues should be treated sympathetically with workers
 shramikon ko prabandh main bhaag lene kaa avasar pradaan kiya jaay, saath hi unke dwaara anubhav kii gayi kathinaaiyon ko bhi dur kiya jaay, shramik sanghon kii bahulatata ko kam kiya jaay or shramikon main prajatantric mulyon ko viksit kiya jaay taaki unke apane varg main parsparik sammaan kii vruddhi ho sake
 Measures such as cooperatives should be used

 If a country's major industries lose out on foreign competition, loss of work and tax revenue can severely distort that country's economy and increase poverty
 agar kisi desh ke jeevanyaapan kaa maanak yaa audyogic niyamon kaaphi ooncha ho to gharelu udyog chote deshon ke saath samjhauta kiye bina unke saath asanrakshit vyapaar ko jivit rakh sakate hai; is samjhaute main neeche kii ek vaishvik daud shaamil he
 Protective tariffs have historically been used as a measure against this possibility
 haalanki, sangrakshnatmak teriffon se nuksaan bhi hota he
 Most notable is that they inhibit the price of goods subject to tariffs by weakening local competition, causing losses to consumers or manufacturers of the goods who use the goods to produce something different: for example, Food tariffs can increase poverty, while tariffs on steel or steel may make automobile manufacturers less competitive
 ve ulti pratikriya bhi kar sakate hai agar tarriff se nuksaan hone vaale vyapaar ko karne vaale desh khud par hi tarriff lagaate hai jiske parinamswaroop vyapaar yuddh shuru ho jaataa he or, mukt vyapaar siddhantkaron ke anusaar, donon pakshon ko nuksaan uthaanaa padataa he
 According to neo-traditional economic principles, tariffs are a harmful interference with the laws of individual freedom and free market

 is vakrarekha se ek purvanumaan miltaa he ki maal yaa seva kii antarrashtriya aapurti puri tarah se namya he or yah bhi ki duniya main bataai gai keemat par ek najdiki anant maatra main utpaadan ho saktaa he
 Obviously, in real-world situations, this is somewhat impractical or unrealistic, but making such predictions is unlikely to have any material impact on the model's outcome
 is maamle main maal kii antarrashtriya keemat 50 dollar he 
 The above model is completely accurate only in extreme situations where none belongs to the consumer group and the cost of the product is a fraction of their salary
 agar iske bajaay, ham vipareet charam sthiti ko lete hai or maan lete hai ki sabhi upabhokta nirmaataa samooh se sambandhit hai or yah bhi maan lete hai ki unki ekmaatr kharidari shakti vetan se sambandhit he jo utpaadan ke rup main praapt hota he or utpaada kii laagat unka puraa vetan he, to graph ekadam alag dikhaai detaa he
 Without tariffs, only producers or manufacturers / consumers capable of producing the product at world price would have enough money to buy it at that price
 chote exl trikon ko kharidne main abhi bhi samarth upabhoktaaon ke ek samaan chote darpan chhavi trikon se milan kiya jayega
 tarriff ke saath, ek bada sidiel trikon or uskaa darpan batch paaegaa
 Also note that there is no incentive to buy imported goods over domestic, with tariffs or without tariffs, as each has the same price
 keval rin ke madhyam se, parisampattiyon ko bechakar, yaa nai tarah kii gharelu utpaadan se nae vetan ke madhyam se uplabdh kharidne kii shakti main pherbadal karke aaayaatit maal ko karidaa jayega
 yaa, jaahir he, agar isaki keemat keval mazdooree yaa vetan kaa ek ansh ho
 In the real world, as more imported goods replace domestic goods, they consume a much larger fraction of the available domestic salaries, leading the graph to move towards this approach of the model
 agar utpaadan ke nae tareeke samay par na mili, to desh diwalia ho jayega or aatanrik raajnneetik dabaav ke falswaroop rin kaa bhugtan nahin ho paaegaa, bahut zyada tarriff lagegaa, yaa usase bhi badtar haalat ho jaaegi
 The establishment of tariffs slows down this process, allowing more time for new types of production to develop, but it also strengthens industries that may never regain competitive pricing
 tarriff ko ek swatantra raashtra kii sthapana karne ke liye ek raajnneetik upkaran ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america kaa tarriff act of 1789 arthath prashulk adhinium 1789, jis par vishesh rup se 4 july ko hastakshar kiya gaya tha, ko akhbaaron ne "second dikaleyareshan of independence" arthath 'swatantraaa kii duusari ghoshnaa' kaha kyonki iskaa makasad saarvbhaumik or swatantra sanyukt rajya america ke raajnneetik lakshya kii prapti ke liye ek aarthik saadhan bananaa tha
 In modern times, the political impact of tariffs is seen in a positive and negative sense
 2002 united stats steel tarriff arthath 2002 kaa sanyukt rajya america ispaat prashulk ne teen varshon kii ek avadhi tak vibhinn prakaar ke aaayaatit steel utpaadon par 30% kaa tarriff lagaaya

 Tariffs can sometimes emerge as a political issue before an election

 In the biogas plant, after digestion of cow dung, 25% solids are converted into gas and 75% solids are converted to manure
 2 ghan meter ke gas sanyantr main jisamen kareeb 50 kilo gobar roj yaa 18-25 ton gobar ek varsh main daalaa jaataa he, us gobar se 80% namiyukt kareeb 10 ton byogas slori kaa khaad praapt hota he
 It is a very good manure for farming, it contains nitrogen 1
5 to 2% phosphorus 1
0% and potash 1
0%
 byogas sanyantra se jab slori ke rup main khaad baahar aata he tab jitna nitrogen gobar main hota he utana hi nitrogen slori main bhi hota he, parantu sanyantra main pachan kriya ke dauraan carbon kaa roopaantar gas main hone se carbon kaa pramaan kam hone se carbon nitrogen anupaat kam ho jaataa he va isse nitrogen kaa pramaan badha hua prathit hota he
 20% nitrogen amo in thin slurry produced from biogas plant
 Nickel is in the form of nitrogen, so if it is used immediately by making drains in the field or mixed with irrigation water and left in the field, then its benefit is like chemical fertilizer immediately on the crop and in production 10 to 20 byogas sanyantr main gobar kii pachan kriya ke baad 25% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar gas ke rup main hota he or 75% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar khaad ke rup main hota he
 In a 2 cubic meter gas plant, in which about 50 kg of cow dung or 18-25 tons of dung is added in a year, about 10 tons of biogas slurry containing 80% moisture is obtained from that cow dung
 yah kheti ke liye ati uttam khaad hota he isamen nitrogen 1
5 se 2% phosphorus 1
0% evam potash 1
0% tak hota he
 When the fertilizer comes out in the form of slurry from the biogas plant, the nitrogen is present in the slurry as much nitrogen is also present in the slurry, but during the digestion in the plant, there is evidence of carbon conversion in the gas due to reduced carbon nitrogen
 The ratio decreases and the evidence of nitrogen appears to be increased
 byogas sanyantra se nikali patali slori main 20% nitrogen amo
 nikal nitrogen ke rup main hota he atah yadi iskaa turant upyog khet main naaliyaan banaakar athwa sinchai ke pani main milakar khet main chhod diya jaae to iskaa laabh rasinic khaad kii tarah se fasal par turant hota he or utpaadan main 10 se 20% tak badhat ho sakati he
 After drying the slurry manure, some part of nitrogen flies in the air
 yah khaad acinchit kheti main ek hectares main kareeb 5 ton va sinchai vaali kheti main 10 ton prati hectares ke pramaan main daalaa jaataa he
 Biogas slurry manure contains micronutrients and humus in addition to the main ingredients, which improves soil vessel, increases water holding capacity and increases microorganisms
 is khaad ke upyog se anya jaivik khaad kii tarah 3 varshon tak poshak tatv fasalon ko dhire-dhire uplabdh hote rahete he
 If the dung gas plant is near home and away from the field, then there is a lot of space to store the thin slurry and transfer of thin slurry is also difficult, in such a situation it is necessary to dry the slurry

 In this, two cement tanks of 1

 When the slurry of liquid form falls from the exhaust chamber, the water of the slurry is sieved through the waste and collected in the pits below
 is tarah jitna pani byogas sanyantr main gobar kii bharaai ke samay daalaa jaataa he uskaa 2 / 3 hissaa gaddhe main punah ekatra ho jaataa he ise gobar ke saath milakar punah sanyantr main daalane se gas utpaadan bad jaataa he
 Apart from this, all the nutrients are in a soluble state, so spraying on the plants improves the growth of the plants and increases the fruit
 kareeb 15-20 dinon main pehla tanks bhar jaataa he tab is tanks ko dhak kar slori kaa nikaas duusare tanks main khol diya jaataa he, iskaa bhandaaran alag se gaddhe main kiya ja saktaa he athwa isko baiylgaadee main bharkar khet tak pahunchaana aasaan hota he
 With the help of a filtration tank, more biogas slurry can be stored in less space and the water is also saved by getting the filtered water out and reusing it in the plant
 is prakaar byogas sanyantra se byogas dwaara eendhan kii samasya kaa samaadhaan to hota hi he saath main slori ke rup main uttam khaad bhi kheti ke liye praapt hota he
 Therefore, it would be appropriate to call the biogas plant also a biodegrad slurry manure plant

 Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev was the former General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and was the principal ruler of the Soviet Union from 1964 until his death in 1982
 unka atharah saal kaa shasankaal joseph stallin ke alaava kisi bhi anya soviet shaasha se lambaa tha
 During this period, on one hand he made the Soviet Union very powerful militarily and greatly increased its influence on the world stage, but on the other hand, the economic situation of the Soviet Union was greatly reduced

 Basically, this idea expresses the advanced stage of socialism
 jahaan samaajwaad main kartavya or adhikaar ke vitaran ko 'harek se apni kshamtanusaar, harek ko karyaanusaar' ke sutara se niyamit kiya jaataa he, vahiin samyawad main 'harek se kshamtanusaar, harek ko aavashyaktaanusaar' siddhant kaa lagu kiya jaataa he
 Communism prohibits personal property
 pratham vishwayuddh, samaajawaadee andolan ke liye ek mahatvapurn ghatana thi
 While on the one hand the socialist movement and their international organization almost disintegrated at the beginning of it, on the other hand, there was a Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the foundation of the first successful socialist state in the world, which had a profound impact on the socialist movements of the world
 
 pratham mahayuddh ke purv samaajawaadee dalon kaa mat tha ki poonjivadi vyavastha hi yudhon ke liye uttaradaayi he or yadi vishwayuddh aarambh hua to prayek samaajawaadee dal kaa kartavya hona chahie ki vah apni poonjeewaadi sarkaar kii yudhniti kaa virodh kare or grihayuddh dwaara samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye prayatnsheel ho
 But as soon as the war started, except for the socialist parties of Russia and Italy, the majority of all the parties supported the policy of their governments
 samaajwaadiyon ke keval ek naganya alpamat ne hi yuddh kaa virodh kiya or aage chalakar inamen se kuch vladimir lenin or uske samyavaadee antarrashtriya sanghathan ke samarthak bane
 But due to the conflicting tactics of the socialist movements of different countries, their unity came to an end
 bolshevik dal rus ke kai samaajawaadee dalon main se ek tha
 It was successful under the special circumstances of 1917
 roosi samaajwaad kii parshwabhoomi anya europea samaajawaadon kii sthiti se bhinn thi
 The Russian Empire was lagging behind the leading countries of Europe in industry trade, so the majority of the working class could not be more influential here
 yahan loktantratmak shashan or vyaktigat swadhinataon kaa bhi abhaav tha
 The Russian intelligentsia and the middle class were keen on them, but due to jargon repression, the constitutional path of their attainment was blocked
 in paristhitiyon se prabhavit vahaan ke pratham samaajawaadee rus ke gramin commune ko apane vichaaron kaa aadhaar maanate the tathaa krantikari maarg dwaara jaarshahi kaa naash loktantrwaad kii safalataa ke liye pratham sopan samajhate the
 Among those thinkers are Hergen, Lavrov, Charnyshevsky and Bakunin
 inase prabhavit hokar anek buddhijivi kranti kii ore agrasar hue
 In this way the foundation of Narodnik mass movement was laid and Narodanya Volya organization was formed
 san 1901 main iskaa naam saamaajik krantikari party rakhaa gaya
 By the time of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, it was the largest socialist party in Russia, but its area of influence was mostly rural people
 iske vam paksh ne bolshevik kranti kaa samarthan kiya
 The second socialist ideology, which included the Bolshevik Party, is also known as the Russian Social People's Labor Party
 iskaa prabhaav mukhyat: naagarik majdoor varg main tha
 Industries in Russia were few, but large in scale and hired more workers than expected
 at: in mazdooron main raajnneetik chetana or sanghathan adhik tha
 In the absence of democracy, it was difficult for the workers to struggle, so the working class came under revolutionary influence and due to the conditions like Germany, most of the labor leaders here were also influenced by Marxist and Germany's Social Democratic Party
 san 1890 ke lagbhag excrod or plekhanov ne petersvarg main pratham majdoor samooh sthapit kiye jo aage chalakar 1898 main roosi saamaajik loktantrvaadi majdoor party ke aadhaar bane
 The leader of the Russian Social Democratic Democratic Labor Party was a staunch Marxist, so he rejected recapitalism and developed Marxism and applied it to Russian conditions
 mazdooron kii rahan sahan ke str main unnati hui thi, is satya ko na maananaa kathin tha, parantu plekhanov ne siddh kiya ki nai mashiinon ke prayog or mazdooree main apekshaya vruddhi na hone ke kaaran poonjeewaadi shoshan kii dar badhati ja rahi he
 Bukharin argued that imperialist countries were able to keep their working class satisfied by exploiting the colonies
 tratski aadi ne kaha ki poonjeewaadi kaa sankat sarvyaapee ho gaya he or is sthiti main yah sambhav he ki kranti pashchim europe ke agrani deshon main na hokar apekshaakrit pichde deshon main, jahaan samrajyavaadee kadi sabase kamjor he, vahaan ho
 Some thinkers first showed Russia the location of the socialist revolution
 tratski or lenin kaa mat tha ki samaajawaadee kranti usee samay safal ho sakati he jab vah kai deshon main ek saath faile, sthaayee kranti ke bina keval ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana kathin he
 Later Lenin and Stalin amended this principle to create Soviet power on the basis of unilateral socialism
 nikolai lenin ne uparyukt vichaaron kaa samanvay karke bolshevik dal kaa sanghathan or oktober kranti kaa netritv kiya
 At the London Conference of 1903, the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party articulated its socialist ideal, but within this class party two ideologies emerged and later they formed two parties
 is conference main utpaadan ke sadhano ke rashtriyakaran, jameendaari unmoolan, upniveshon kaa aatmanirmaan kaa adhikaar, dhyey kii prapti kaa krantikari maarg or kranti ke baad sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee-is niti ko sweekaar kiya gaya, parantu dal ke sanghathan ke sambandh main netaaon main matbhed ho gaya
 The question was whether the membership of the party should be limited only to the workers or every person accepting the ideals should be its officer and should the Central Committee have the right to dissolve the branches of the party and appoint new branches in their place? Lenin was in favor of a well-organized party with military discipline and had a majority in the conference, hence the name of this section was Bolshevik and the second section was called Menshevik
 aage chalakar in dalon ke bich or bhi matbhed upasthit hue
 The Menshevik Party first wanted to end the capitalist democratic revolution of the end of Tsarism and in this revolution, it wanted to cooperate with the left side of the capitalist parties, but after the revolution of 1905, Lenin and his companions came to the conclusion that due to fear of socialist revolution, capitalism Has become reactionary, therefore it is also unable to lead the capitalist democratic revolution
 isliye is kranti kaa netritv bhi keval sarvhaara varg hi kar saktaa he or is kranti ko sarvhaara kranti ke saath milakar jaarshahi ke baad ekadam samaajwaad kii sthapana sambhav he
 Lenin was in favor of dividing feudal land among the peasants to get the support of the peasants in the revolution, the Mensheviks wanted to socialize it immediately
 bolshevik dal ne pratham mahayuddh kaa virodh kiya or samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye grihayuddh kaa naaraa diya
 The war-torn public, and especially the Russian troops, welcomed this policy, but the Mensheviks did not oppose the war and continued the war by joining the government after the February March revolution
 san 1917 kii oktober kranti main lenin ke vichaaron or bolshevik sanghathan kii vijay hui
 After the Paris Commune of 1871, in 1917, the first permanent socialist state - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was established
 is rajya main utpaadan ke sadhano-udyog dhandhe, vyapaar, vinimay, bhoomi aadi-kaa rashtriyakaran kiya gaya or shoshak varg kii aarthik tathaa raajnneetik shakti kaa ant kar diya gaya
 Within the country, initially the representatives of peasants, laborers and soldiers were ruled by mixed Soviets, but according to the constitution of 1936, a bicameral parliament was established
 iske upree sadan kaa chunaav soviet desh ke vibhinn ganraajyon dwaara hota he tathaa nimna sadan ke sadsy kshetreey nirvachan kshetron dwaara chune jate hai
 But Soviet countries are one-party states, the state power is in the hands of communist party
 kisi duusare dal ko raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa adhikaar nahin
 After the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Party named itself the Communist Party and in 1919 published a second Communist Manifesto, on the basis of which a new international movement - Communist International - was established and with its help started the propagation of communism in various countries
 lenin ke vichaaron ko samyawad kii sangya di jaati he, parantu lenin ke baad joseph stallin maotsethung nikita chrishchov tathaa vibhinn deshon ke samyavaadee netaaon ne in vichaaron kii vyakhya or unka vikaas kiya he
 All these ideas fall under the category of communism
 stallin ke vichaaron main uskaa upniveshon ko aatmanirnay kaa adhikaar, niojit arthvyavastha arthath panchavarshiya aadi yojanaayen tathaa samuhik or rajkeey swaamitv main kheti mukhya hai
 The impact of socialism increased in the world between the Second World War and after the success of Soviet forces and other international conditions
 yuddh kaa ant hone tak na keval purvi europe soviet prabhavakshetra ban gaya, varan san 1948 i
 tak inamen se adhikansh deshon main samyavaadee rajya sthapit ho gaye
 In Asia too, communism was successful in a large country like China and under the influence of Soviet and People's Republic of China, the rule of North Asia and North Vietnam came under communist influence
 samyawad kaa asar sabhi deshon main badha
 Countries such as France, Italy and Hindustia have powerful communist parties
 parantu samyawad ke prasar ne us andolan ke saamne kai saidhantik or vyaavhaarik kathinaaiyaan upasthit kii hai- Communist Yugoslavia's ruler Josip Brozovit Tito and his other communist allies were the first to challenge the Soviet leadership
 yugoslavia bahut kuch apane prayatnon se swatantra hua tha at: uske andar swabhimaan kii bhaavana thi
 He was also not surrounded by Soviet influence like other communist countries of East Europe
 yugoslav paksh kaa kahana tha ki soviet sarkaar unki audyogic unnati main baadhak he tathaa unki swatantraaa ko simit karti he
 His stanzas later proved to be true, but at that time Titoism was called the pivot of recidivism, Trotskyism or imperialism
 siddhant ke str par titowad ne rashtriya samyavad, shakti ke vikendrikaran, kisaanon dwaara bhoomi kaa nijee swaamitv, rajya or naukarshahi ke sthaan main udyogon par mazdooron kaa niyantran tathaa samyavaadee dal or desh ke andar apekshaakrit adhik swadhinata par jor diya
 Tito's ideas have had an impact on other communist countries in Eastern Europe
 samyavaadee deshon ke bich samanta kii maang ko sweekaar karke khrushchov ne titowad ko anshat: sweekaar kiya, parantu saath hi usne lenin stallinavaad main bhi kai mahatvapurn sanshodhan kiye hai
 Lenin thought that until the end of imperialism, there would be war in the world, but according to Khrushkov, at this time the powers of progress are so strong that world war can be stopped and peaceful coexistence between capitalist and socialist systems is possible
 vah yah bhi kahata he ki in paristhitiyon main samaajwaad kii sthapana kaa keval krantikari maarg hi nahin he, varan vibhinn deshon main alag alag samyavaadee dalon dwaara vikasvaadi or shantimay tareekon se bhi uski sthapana sambhav he
 In the other countries of the world, the above thought change has had a profound effect on communist ideology
 tito ke vidroh ke baad purv europe ke anya samyavaadee deshon ne bhi soviet prabhaav se swatantra hone kaa praytn kiya he
 The Russian communists reject Khrushchev's amendments and the military conflict between the Soviet and China is not only getting worse
 sansar ke lagbhag sabhi samyavaadee dal soviet or chini vichaardhaaraon ke aadhaar par vibhakt hote ja rahe hai kuch vichaarak rashtriya samyavaadee dalon kii saidhantik or sanghathanaatmak swatantraaa par bhi jor dete hai
 Thus the unity and internationalism of communist ideas and movement is declining
 pratham mahayuddh ke baad samyawad kii hi nahin loktantratmak samaajwaad kii bhi pragati hui he
 In the midst of the two great wars Britain had twice as many working governments
 pratham mahayuddh ke baad germany or austria main samaajawaadee shashan sthapit hue; france or spain aadi deshon main samaajawaadee dalon kii shakti badi
 But soon their response also started
 san 1922 main benito musolini ne italy main phacist shashan sthapit kiya
 Fascism is an enemy of labor and socialist movements and a supporter of war and imperialism
 vah poonjeewaadi vyavastha kaa ant nahin karata
 The basic principles of Nazism are similar to fascism
 is vichaardhaara kaa prachaarak adolf hitler tha
 After the economic crisis of 1929, Natsi rule was established in Germany in 1932 and later the influence of this ideology spread to the countries of Spain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and France
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke bich fasivadi vichaaron kaa hraas tathaa samaajawaadee vichaaron or andolanon kii pragati hui he
 In addition to the communist regimes of Eastern Europe, for some time in Western Europe, several countries formed joint regimes in collaboration with socialist and communist parties
 europe ke kuch anya deshon jaise tathaa austrailia or newjiland aadi deshon main samay samay par samaajawaadee sarkarein banati rahi hai
 In this period, countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America have also established socialist rule
 inamen china, burma, hind asia, singapore, ghana or cuba mukhya hai
