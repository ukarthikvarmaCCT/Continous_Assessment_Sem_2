 isse unke anuyaayiyon ne anurodh kiya ki yadi in shastrarthon evam vyakhyanon ko lipibaddh kar diya jaay to ye amar ho jaayenge
 The creation of Satyarth Prakash was possible only due to the request of his followers
 satyarth prakaash kii rachana kaa pramukh uddeshy arya samaaj ke siddhanton kaa prachaar-prasar tha
 Along with this, there is a rebuttal of Christianity, Islam and many other texts and beliefs
 us samay hindu shastron kaa galat arth nikaal kar hindu dharm evam samskruti ko badnaam karne kaa shadyantr bhi chal rahaa tha
 Keeping this in mind, Maharishi Dayanand named it Satyartha Prakash, which sheds light on the true meaning
 samaaj sudhaarak swami dayanand saraswati kii is rachana kaa mukhya prayojan satya ko satya or mithyaa ko mithyaa hi pratipaadan karnaa he
 Although Hindu life takes place before both the individual and society, it is often seen among Hindus that there is more individualistic tendency than collectivist

 Swami Dayanand prevented these deadly tendencies through Arya Samaj and Satyarth Prakash
 unhone yahan tak likhaa - "swarajya main utpann hue hi mantri hone chaiye
 God is our king
 vah krupa karke hamako rajdhikari kare
 "along with this, he emphasized the love of the Aryan civilization and culture and reverence for the Vedas, Upanishads etc

 In relation to its language, Dayanand ji himself wrote in the second edition of this book in 1882 - "at the time when i made this book, at that time
 Due to the cultural speech and the language of birthplace, i have special knowledge of this language
 Neither was
 isse bhashaa ashuddh ban gai thi
 Now it has been printed for the second time by purifying it according to language-grammar
 " Its main messages are different from traditional Hindu customs and sometimes even against them
 ye is prakaar hai - As would be clear, Swami Dayanand's view was to refute many beliefs and opinions and to bring the Vedas opinion back into light

 The music of the film is decorated by Ajit Singh
 film kaa pardaarpan 200 varsh purv, raja harman singh ke sultanate bijapur se hoti hoti he, jiske nikat ek kaali pahari sthit he
 The king is troubled by the disappearance of his beloved daughter, Princess Rupali, where the devil-priest Samaritan resides
 jahaan rajkumaari puraane kile ke raste bhatak jaati he or dusht samari use agava kar, yatnaaen detaa he
 To identify specifically for his victim, he apparently beats the victim through his eyes, where his normal eyes turn into satanic posture and turn white
 or is prakriya dauraan, samari kii ankhen surkh lahu sa laal ho jaataa tha
 King Harman Singh decides to capture the Samaritan to end this panic and orders the soldiers to arrest him
 samari ko peshi par bithaaya jaataa he, jahaan croor aparaadho kii fehrist padhi jaati he
 He carried out many such gruesome and heinous deeds so that his great master would please the devil and expand his powers
 usne kai navabyahi dulhanon ko aguva kar balaatkaar kiya or unki antadiyon ko cheer daalaa; maasoom naunihaalon va bacchon ko apahiz kiya or uskaa maance bhakshan kiya; uske saath hi — uske ab tak ke sabase achambhit kar dene aaropon main se ek jo padhaa gaya — wo tha murda jismon ko khodakar unki bali chadhaanaa or bhakshan karnaa; or bijapur ke aas-paas based bastiyon apane khauf se shaitan kaa raaj failaayaa
 Simultaneously, the Rajpurohit criminals suggest Samaris to be cremated in the holy fire, but the sponsorship of the king remains something else - that the Samaritans be beheaded, where his headless torso is cut off behind the old temple of Kali Ghat
 To be buried and the head sealed in a strong box and placed in the king's mansion
 us sandook ko kade zanjeeron se baandhane saath raajpurohit kii salaah par bhagwaan shiv kaa trishul bhi rakh diya jaataa he taaki shaitan isi tarah jakadaaa rah jaae
 However, before he dies, the Samaritan curses the king in the end: "as long as my head is separated from my torso, the woman who gives birth to each of your children will not be alive; and when my head is attached to my body, i will live again
" i will rise up and wipe out every person in your family! " is tarah saalon guzarate he, rajasi rajyon ko bhartiya ganraajyon ke saath vilay kiya jaataa he, or raja hariman singh parpote, thakur ranvir singh ab shahar main rah-basar karte hai
 The Samaritan also has a long time, but is still not forgotten
 yah uskaa shaitani prakope hi tha jo pita se putr badastoor harmansingh ke khandaan tak jari rahaa, or uskaa manahuus shraap harek pidiyon ke saath duharaata rahaa
 Ranveer Singh's wife also gave birth to their daughter Suman
 suman, ab ek kalege chaatra he, jiskaa ek bwyfrand sanjay he or donon yah yuva prem jodi apana adhikansh vakt pool main, sagar tat par, or nitaklbon main bitaate
 At the same time, when Thakur gets the news of their relationship, he apparently rejects this relationship harshly because Sanjay is not of any princely house
 suman chunki apane khandaani shraap ke bare anjaan he or apane pyaar ke prati ziddee bhi, or sanjay bhi use paane ko lekar adig he
 He meets Thakur in an attempt to find out the reason for his displeasure and it is from here that he understands the secret of the ill-fated curse that has haunted his family for the last 200 years
 antat sanjay suman ke pita ke manodasha ko samaj letaa he or suman ke bina hi vahaan se laut padataa he
 However, Suman leaves her house in the middle of the night and refuses to go to Bijapur with Sanjay to investigate there and, if possible, remove this illusory stain with an investigation and end the satanic barrier on his love
 Will be able to is tarah ve bijapur ke safar main sanjay ke dildaar dost anand or uski bivi sapana ko bhi saath le chalate hai
 His first trip to Bijapur is full of dangers
 unki car ke pahie tak pankchar ho jate he, vahiin tab unki mulaakaat dian si dikhanewaali aurat mangali or uskaa rahasyamayi betaa durjan se hoti he jo purv raja harmansingh kii haveli ke chaukeedaar or bawarchi he
 At the same time, he befriends a clumsy Sanga, who secretly believes that the treasure is buried somewhere in this mansion
 haveli kii deevaaren raja harimansingh kii tasveeron se ati rahati he; vahiin suman ko vah tasviren is tarah sajaayi lagati he jaise vah unako ghur rahi ho; tathaa is bhay se aisa mahasoos hota he jaise khud samari unki nigahabani kar rahaa ho
 At the same time there are many such scary incidents, but somehow Anand and Sanjay together break the back wall and find the box in which the chopped head of Samaritan is kept
 unhen galatfahami hoti he ki sir jarur kisi nidar sipaahi hog, jisane raja kii avhelnaa kar uske dand ko bhugat rahaa he
 This way the care of filling the wall leaves for the next day
 durbhaagya se sanga or durjan yah sara ghatnakram gaur karte hai
 Sanga, already bent on looking at the treasure, suppresses his greed and removes the trident from it
 samari kaa vah adhamra sir use jaise mantrmugdh karata he ki vah uski samadhi tak le chale
 Sanga reaches the old temple to attach that head to the torso and for the terrible process of this connection, he cuts his hand with a knife and pours his blood on the Samaritan's neck, the Samaritan is done
 pichley 200 saalon kii nafrat paala hua, samari ab raja harmansingh kii auladon kaa badi crurata se hatyaon kaa anjaam detaa he or ek baar phir vahaan kii basti main jaise shaitani raaj kaa saaya pad jaataa he
 The people of the town have no choice but to accept Satan's authority
 kasben ke kai nivaasiyon main jaise afvaah or tanaav kaa maahaul dhar jaataa he or vahiin anand bhi samari ke haathon bhayanak maut marataa he
 Right now, they were facing this terrible attack until Thakur Ranveer Singh arrived
 vah un mahaan hastiyon ke rishton se sahi, magar unako bhi koi raah sujh nahin tha ki is khun ke pyaase samari ko kaise parajeet karen
 In this desperation, the settlers are forced to seek refuge in the temple and the Samaritan could not enter the holy place himself
 ve log bhagwaan shiv kii aarti aradhana karte hai
 There was a divine guidance before Sanjay's arrival; That trident is the only key that can prevent that monster
 sanjay or suman us trishul ko paane bhaagate-daudte haveli jate he, samari ko ladane ke liye lalakaara ja sake
 But unknown to all this, Durjan removes that trident on some other side of the mansion
 sanjay or suman tab haveli main fas jate hai jab vah raktpipasu samari pehle hi shikaar ke liye ghaat par baitha tha
 Finally, in the wake of this uproar, Sanjay somehow pulls the coffin by trapping the Samaritan and, then holding a trident in his hands, overcomes the monster, dragging him to the village square
 vahiin par, aanan-fanan main uski chita taiyaar kii jaati he or samari ko jinda jalaakar use khatm kiya jaataa he
 a few days later, Suman and Sanjay get married and Suman's family is again filled with happiness
 film main sammilit sampurna sangeet kii nimna suchi is prakaar he: Active memory remains active while learning any task
 yadi ham koi bhi lekh padhate hai yaa kuch bhi dekhte hai to yah smriti hi sakriy rahati he
 For example, if we are reading about an object and we are asked a question related to it, then everyone will answer this question sooner than the rest of the time

 anuwaad darshan main prakruti ke alpatam ansh ko anu yaa parmaanu kehete hai
 Atomism claims that every natural substance is made up of molecules and the formation and breakdown of substances is another name for the accidental separation of molecules
 pracheen kaal main anuwaad darshanik vivechan kaa ek pramukh vishay tha, parantu vaigyanikon ne ise sweekaar nahin kiya
 In contrast, philosophers have been indifferent on its part in modern times, but for physics, the design and process of molecules has become a major subject of study
 bharat main vaisheshik darshan ne anu par vishesh vichaar kiya he
 Partition is the ultimate or end in the division of nature, division cannot go beyond this
 dimakritas ke anusaar prayek anu parinaam or akruti rakhata he, parantu inamen kisi prakaar kaa jatibhed nahin
 This was also the opinion of Lucipus
 ampidochlose ne pruthivi, jal or agni ke anuon main jatibhed dekha
 The combination of molecules is dependent on the separation speed and the speed can only be zero
 abhajya anuon ke saath pracheen anuwaad ne shunya ke astitv ko bhi sweekaar kiya
 In the early 19th century, John Dalton strongly supported atomism
 use uchit rup se aadhunik anuwaad kaa pita kaha jaataa he
 Many are given for confirmation of atomism, of which two are: prayek padaarth dabaav ke neeche sikud jaataa he or dabaav dur hone par fail jaataa he
 In the condition of gases, this inhibition and dispersion are clearly visible
 kisi vastu kaa sankoch uske anuon kaa ek-duusare ke nikat aana he, uskaa failana anuon ke antar kaa adhik hona hi he
 The law of multiplied ratios confirms atomism
 jab do bhinn anu rasinic sanyog main aate hai, to unamem ek ke achal maatra main rahane par, doosraa anu 2,3,4 
 
 
 ikaayiyon main hi use miltaa he, 212, 334 aadi matraaon main nahin miltaa
 The reason for this seems to be that there is no 12 or 34 fraction of the molecule
 vaisheshik darshan kaa uddeshy moulik padaarthon yaa paratam jatiyon kaa adhyayan he
 The first place among these substances is given to matter
 nau dravyon main pehle paanch dravya pruthivi, jal, tej, vaayu or akaash hai
 This means that not all natural molecules are homogeneous, but they have caste differences
 is vichaar main vaisheshik dimakritas se nahin apitu ampidokliz se miltaa he
 Racism in molecules is not a matter of direct, it can only be conjecture
 aise anumaan kaa aadhaar kya he? vaisheshik ke anusaar, kaaran ke bhav se hi kaary kaa bhav hota he
 There is a fundamental caste discrimination in our senses - seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, cannot change into each other
 is bhed kaa kaaran yah he ki in bodhon ke sadhak anuon main bhi jatibhed he
 The combination of molecules is constant
 samta kii haalat main sanyog kaa aarambh sristi he, purna viyog pralay he
 The molecule is continual, so the order of creation and holocaust is also continual
 The essence of hindu atomism is seen in sulabha's discourse, to the king of mithila, dharmadhvaja janaka

 It then transforms itself into the primary embryonic globule called kalala Kalaaladarbudottatti: Muscular artery
 peshyastvangabhinirvrittirnkharomani changatah 

 117

 The kalala divides to a state with numerous bubbles called, and the arbuda gives rise to an elongated sheath like form
 From the peshi, emerges the a ~ nga, where the rudiments of all the organs are seen, from this form differentiates the external elements like hair and nails

 Ever state comes and goes

 Relationship: Kosti Bhootanan Swayarpyaavaiyavarih

 An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to devices participating in a computer network using the Internet Protocol for communication between its nodes
 ek IP adress do pramukh kaary karata he: mejabaan yaa network interfes pahchaan or sthaan parichayan
 isaki bhoomika kaa charitrachitran is prakaar he: "ek naam ingit karata he ki ham kya maangate hai
 An address indicates where he is
 ek maarg ingit karata he ki vahaan tak kaise pahunchen
" The designer of TCP / IP defined the IP address as a 32-bit number, and the system, known as Internet Protocol version 4 or ipv4, is still in use today
 baharhaal, internet ke vyapak vikaas or iske parinamswaroop uplabdh paton kii kami ke kaaran, 1995 main adress ke liye 128 bit upyog kar ke ek nayaa parichayan system, viksit kiya gaya or pichhali baar 1998 main RFC 2460 dwaara manakikrut kiya gaya
 Although IP addresses are stored as binary numbers, they are usually displayed in human-textual markers such as 208

 As the development of private networks raised the threat of ipv4 address termination, RFC 1918 set out a set of private address spaces that could be used by anyone on a private network
 vah vaishvik saarvajanik internet se judane ke liye, aksar network adress anuvadak ke saath upyog kiye jate hai
 The Internet Assigned Number Authority, which manages universal IP address space allocation, supports five regional Internet registries to allocate IP blocks to local Internet registries and other entities
 internet protocol ke do sanskaran upyog main hai: ai pi sanskaran 4 or ypi sanskaran 6
 sanskaran itihaas dekhen
) prayek sanskaran ek ypi adress ko alag dhang se paribhaashit karata he
 Because of its prevalence, the generic term IP address generally still refers to the address defined by ipv4
 ipv4, 32-bit adress kaa upyog karata he, jo adress sthaan ko 4,294,967,296 ) sambhav adwitiya adress par simit karata hai
 ipv4 reserves some addresses for special purposes such as private networks or multicast addresses
 isse ant upyogkartaaon ko niyat kiye jane vaale paton kii sankhya kam ho jaati he or jaise hi uplabdh paton kii sankhya kshay ho jaati he, ipv4 pataa samaapan nishchit ho jaataa he
 This foreseeable shortfall was the primary motivation for developing ipv6, which is in various deployment stages around the world, as the only strategy for ipv4 replacement and continued expansion of the Internet
 ipv4 adress aamtaur par dot-dashamalav sanketan main darshaae jate hai 
 Each part represents 8 bits of address and is therefore called octet
 takneekee lekhan ke kam aam maamalon main, ipv4 adress, shodash aadhari, ashtadhari, yaa binary abhivedan main prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 Each octet is changed individually in the most representation
 internet protocol ke vikaas ke praarambhik charan main, network ke prashaskon ne IP adress kaa do bhaagon main varnan kiya, network sankhya bhaag or mejabaan sankhya main bhaag
 ek adress main sarvocch kram ocotate ko network number abhinihit kiya jaataa tha or baaki ke bits rest field yaa host identiphire kehalaae jate the or network ke abhyantar mezbaan sankhyankan ke liye istemaal kiye jate the
 This method soon proved to be analogous as soon as additional networks were developed that were independent of the existing networks, which would have already been characterized by a network number
 1981 main, classphul network sanrachana ke samaveshan ke saath internet parichayan vinirdesh main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 Classful network design allowed a large number of individual network tasks
 ek IP adress ke sabase mahatvapurn ocotate ke pehle teen bit, adress kii shrenee ke rup main paribhaashit kiye gaye
 Three categories were defined for universal unicast detection
 vyutpann varg ke aadhaar par network pahchaan puure pate ke octate seemaa kshetron par aadhaarit tha
 Each category used sequentially extra octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the number of possible hosts in the higher class category
 nimna talika is faltah aprachlit pranali kaa ek simhavlokan detaa he
 The description of this design is explained in the article 'subnetwork' and 'classful Network'
 haalanki classphul network abhikalp ek safal vikasaatmak avasthaa thi lekin internet ke betahasha vistaar ke kaaran ise aage badhanaa mushkil ho gaya or jab nae ypi adress khand dene ke liye classles inter-domen rooting kaa srijan kiya gaya or rooting protocol ke liye ipivi4 adress kaa prayog karne ke liye nae niyam taiyaar kiye gaye to ise chhod diya gaya
 CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking for the allocation and routing of arbitrary-length prefixes
 aaj, classphul network sankalpana ke avshisht keval ek simit kshetra main kaam karte hai jo ki kuch network software or hardware ghatakon ke diphalt kanfigration maapdand hai or network prashaskon kii charchaa ke takneekee jorganon main prayukt hote hai
 In the initial network design, when the idea of connecting all Internet users globally from one bite to another for communication was intended, each computer or device had a unique IP address
 lekin yah paaya gaya ki hameshaa aisa kar paanaa sambhav nahin he kyonki nijee network viksit ho gaye or saarvajanik paton kaa sthaan sangrakshit karne kii jarurat padi 
 Computers that are not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only through TCP / IP, are not required to have a globally unique IP address
 nijee network ke liye ipv4 paton main se teen simaaen, har varg ke liye ek seemaa, 1918 RFC main arakshit thi
 These addresses are not routed over the Internet and hence there is no need to coordinate them with the register of IP addresses
 aaj, jab jarurat padati he, aise nijee network aamtaur par network pataa anuwaad ke madhyam se internet se conect ho jate hai
 Any user can use any reserved block

 Its permanent solution, a redesign of the Internet protocol itself, was understood
 internet protocol kii yah agali peedi, jiskaa uddeshy internet par ipv4 kii jagah lenaa tha, antat 1995 main ise internet protocol sanskaran 6 kaa naam diya gaya
 The address size was increased from 32 to 128 bit or 16 octets, which, even with a generous work of network blocks, is considered sufficient for the foreseeable future
 ganitiya, nayaa adress sthaan, adhiktam 2, yaa lagbhag 3
403×10 adwitiya pate kii kshamta pradaan karata he
 The new design is not only based on the goal of providing a sufficient amount of addresses, but to allow efficient aggregation of subnet routing prefixes to occur on the routing nodes
 parinamswaroop, anumaargan talika aakaar chota hota hai or sabase chota sambhav vyaktigat aavanton 264 host ke liye ek sabanet he, jo puure ipv4 internet ke aakaar kaa vargakar he
 At these levels, the actual address usage rate will be smaller on any ipv6 network segment

 ipv6 has features that, if there is a change in global connectivity or routing policy, automatically change the routing prefix of the entire network without internal redesigns or new numbering
 ipv6 paton kii badi sankhya vishisht prayojanon ke liye bade block nirdisht karne kii anumati dete he or jahaan uchit he, kushal maarg ke liye ekatrit hone kii
 a complex address protection technique with a large address space is not required, such as Classless used in inter-domain routing

 Example of an ipv6 address: jaise ipv4 nijee yaa aantarik network ke liye adress arakshit karata he, ipv6 main nijee adress ke liye adress ke vibhaag alag se samucchy kiye hote hai
 In ipv6, these are referred to as unique local addresses
 RFC 4,193 is vibhaag ke liye anumaargan upsarg fc00:: / 7 alag se samucchy karata he, jo ki vibhinn uplakshith nitiyon ke saath do / 8 vibhaagon main vibhajit he adress main ek 40 bit chhadam yadrichhik sankhya shaamil hoti he jo sait vilay yaa packet ke galat maarg par chal jane se hone vaale adress muthbhed ke jokhim ko kam karti he
 Initial designs used a separate section for this purpose, dubbed site-local address
 However, the definition of what constitutes a site remained unclear and a poorly defined detection policy created doubt in routing
 adress range vinirdesh chhod diya gaya or ab nai vyavastha main istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 Addresses starting with fe80: - called link-local addresses - are assigned only in the local link area
 prayek network interfes ke liye oparating system ke IP parat dwaara aamtaur par swachaalit rup se adress utpann kiye jate hai
 This provides instant automatic network connectivity for any ipv6 host and means that if multiple hosts connect to a common hub or switch, they get an instant communication route via their link local ipv6 address
 ipv6 network prashasan kii nichali paraton main is suvidha kaa bade paimaane par or adhikansh upyogkartaaon ke liye apratyaksh rup se, istemaal kiya jaataa he 
 No private address prefix can be sent to the public internet
 sabnating kii takanic donon ipv4 or ipv6 network main kaam kar sakati hai
 The IP address is divided into two parts: the network address and the host identifier
 The subnet mask or CIDR prefix determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts
 shabd sabanet mask keval ipv4 main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Both IP versions, however, use the concept and notation of classless inter-domain routing
 is main, IP adress ke peeche ek slesh or network bhaag ke liye istemaal kii gai bits kii sankhya, jise maarg upsarg bhi kaha jaataa he, hote he
 For example, an ipv4 address and its subnet mask can be 192
0
2
1 and 255
255
255
0, respectively
 ek hi ypi adress or sabanet mask ke liye CIDR sanketan 192
0
2
1 / 24 he, kyonki ypi pate ke pehle 24 bit network or sabanet sankethik karte he
 When a computer is configured to use the same IP address each time it becomes faster, it is called static IP address
 iske vipareet, un sthitiyon main jab computer ke ypi pate swatah hi niyukt kiye jate hai, use dinemic ypi adress ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Static IP address is assigned to the computer manually by an administrator
 isaki sateek prakriya platform ke anusaar pruthak hoti he
 These are not compatible with dynamic IP addresses, which are specified by either computer interfaces or self-hosted software, such as in Xerconf, or specified by a server using dynamic host configuration protocols
 haalanki DHCP ke upyog se nirdisht ypi adress lambey samay ke liye ek jaise rahete hai, vah aam taur par badal sakate hai
 In some cases, a network administrator may actively implement a specified static IP address
 is maamle main, ek DHCP sarwar kaa upyog hota he, lekin ek vishisht computer ko hameshaa ek hi ypi adress nirdisht karne ke liye, iskaa samanurup vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he
 This allows the static IP address to be primarily configured, not requiring each computer on the network to be specifically configured by a manual system
 static yaa statephul adress vinyas ke abhaav yaa vifaltaa main, ek parichaalan pranali ek network interphes ko state-les swachaalit-samakriti takanic, jaise xerokonf, ke upyog se ypi adress nirdisht kar sakati he
 Dynamic IP addresses are most frequently employed by dynamic host configuration protocol servers on lans and broadband networks
 inhen isliye istemaal kiya jaataa he kyunki yah ek network par prayek upkaran ke liye vishisht static adress nirdisht karne ke prashasnic boj se bachaa sakate he
 It also allows multiple devices to interact in a limited address space on a network, but only if some of them are online at a particular time
 In many current desktop operating systems, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default so that a user does not need to manually enter any settings to connect to a network with a DHCP server
 DHCP is not the only technique for specifying dynamic IP addresses
 dyaap or kuch broadband network bindu se bindu protocol kii gatisheel adress visheshtaayen upyog karte hai
 a sticky dynamic IP address or sticky IP cable and DSL is used by the Internet payer to describe a dynamically assigned IP address that often does not change
 pate aamtaur par DHCP protocol ke saath niyukt kiye jate he
 Since modems typically operate for extended periods of time, address leases are often regularized for longer periods and renewed upon expiration
 yadi ek modem band kar diya jaae or adress patte ke agle samaapan se pehle phir se sanchalit kiya jaae, to is baat kii sarvaadhik sambhaavna he ki use vahi IP adress praapt hoga
 The RFC 3330 defines an address block, 169
254
0
0 / 16, to be used exclusively in local-link addressing for ipv4 networks
 ipv6 main, sthitik yaa gatik adress kaaryon kaa upyog karne vaala, prayek interphes fe80:: / 10 sabanet main swatah ek sthaneey-link adress praapt karata he
 These addresses are valid only on the link, such as a local network segment or a point-wise connection to which a host is connected
 ye adress margskshmiya nahin hote or nijee adreson kii tarah internet packet pratibandhan ke strot yaa gantavy nahin ho sakate hai
 When the local-link ipv4 address block was reserved, no standard existed for the address auto-configuration mechanism
 shoonyata bharna, microsoft ne ek karyaanvayan banaaya jise swatah nijee IP adressing kaha gaya
 APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines due to Microsoft's marketability and, thus becoming a de facto standard in the industry
 kai varshon baad, IETF ne is kaaryashiltaa ke liye ek aupchaarik maanak, RFC 3927, sthaneey-link adress ipv4 ke sakriy vinyas kaa adhikari paribhaashit kiya
 Some infrastructure must use a static address, such as obtaining a host of the domain name system that converts the domain name to an IP address
 kisi interprize main sarwar sthapit karne ke liye sthitik adress suvidhajanak bhi he, parantu bilkul aavashyak nahin
 An address received from a DNS server comes with its own lifetime, or caching time, after which it should be viewed to confirm that it did not change
 yahan tak ki sthitik IP adress bhi network prabandhan ke parinamswaroop badal jaataa he
 According to today, firewalls are common on the Internet
 badi hui network suraksha ke liye, vah graahak ke saarvajanik ypi par aadhaarit nijee network ko abhigam niyantran karte hai
 Using a blacklist or white list, the IP address that is blocked is the client's stated public IP address, meaning if the client is using a proxy server or NAT, blocking an IP address can cause many different people Can be blocked
 IP adress prayog karne ke liye ekaadhik graahak upkaran pradarshit ho sakate hai: yaa to isliye kyonki vah ek saajhe hosting web sarwar vaataavaran kaa hissaa hai yaa kyonki ek ipv4 network adress anuvadak yaa proxi sarwar apane graahakon kii ore se ek madhyasth ke rup main kaam karata he, is avasthaa main, asli utpann IP adress ek anurodh praapt kar rahe sarwar se chhipe ho sakate he
 a common practice is for NAT to hide a large number of IP addresses in a private network
 NAT ke keval "bahari" interphes ko internet ruteble adress kii aavashkata he
 The most common net devices map TCP or UDP port numbers on the outside and individual private addresses on the inside
 jaise ek telephone number kaa site-vishesh vistaaran ho saktaa hai, port sankhya IP adress ke liye ek site-vishesh vistaaran hai
 In small home networks, NAT functions typically take place in a residential gateway device, typically sold as a "router"
 is paridrishy main, router se jude computer ke paas 'nijee' IP adress hoga or router ke paas internet ke saath samvaad karne ke liye ek shaskeey adress hoga
 This type of router allows multiple computers to share a public IP address
 vindos main cmand line saadhan ipconfig kaa upyog kar ke ai pi pataa nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 The command line ifconfig in Unix performs this function

 The light of Dua, which is read daily in Dargah Khwaja Saheb Ajmer, was written by Dua Khwaja Hussain Ajmeri
 khwaja hossain ajmeri garib nawaz rahamatullah alaih kii aulad hai
 After the persuasion of your father, the people of Ajmer Sharif decided to take their three brothers to roza-e-khwaja, whose hand would open the door on their own, Roja Sharif himself, and declared him to be the Sajjadanashin of Dargah Sharif
 Will go
 lihaaza aapke do bhaaiyon ke haath se roza shareef kaa darwaja nahin khulaa
 As soon as you put your hand, the door of Rosa Sharif opened, so your choice was made on the decoration
 abul fazal or faizi jo nagaur shareef se taalluq rakhte the, bahut tej va tarraar the, akbar ke khaas logon main shumaar tha
 Akbar worked with Goragi Goi to gain time from the emperor
 hazarat khwaja hossain ajmeri ko abul fazal ne apana khalazaad bhai bataaya
 Akbar was very much in love with Khwaja elderly
 akbar bahut zahin or chaalaak tha
 One day, after reaching Ajmer, Akbar found out from Khwaja Hussain Ajmeri that Abul Fazl is your Khilazad brother
 khwaja hossain ne faramaaya tamaam musalmaan bhai hai
 Akbar repeated the question for the second time
 aapane phir faramaaya tamaam musalmaan bhai hai
 Akbar became silent
 yah sawaal sunakar abul fazal kii darog goi saamne aa gai
 From that very day, there was enmity in your heart for Abul Fazl
 ek din mauka paakar akbar ko khwaja hossain ajmeri ke kilaaf karnaa chaha
 Hazur Khwaja Hussain Ajmeri said to Akbar that the intention of the kings is to collect the Lashkar and attack you and become the emperor of Dehli himself
 akbar ne ye baat sunakar abul fazal se kaha ke se yakeen hua ? is par abul fazal ne kaha tamaam raja unhen salaam karne haazir hote hai, agar aapako sachai maaloom kerani he to bataur imtehaan aap kisi ek raja se yah kahiye ki mujhe khwaja hossain ajmeri kaa sar chahie, sar utaar kar laayaa jaae
 Thus Akbar summoned Raja Bikaner, Raja Jaipur, Raza Jodhpur, to his court and ordered that i want the head of Khwaja Hussain Ajmeri
 teenon raja dast bastaa arz karne lage, huzur hukum ho to ham apane maa baap kaa sar katkar laa sakaten hai, magar ek darvesh sifat bhagat insaan jo tamaam hindu musalaamanon ki belos kidamat kar rahe hai khwaja hossain ajmeri kaa sar kaat kar laana hamaare liye naammumkin he
 And whatever we order, we are present for the command
 jab rajagaan darbar se rukhsat ho chuke to abul fazal ne kaha dekha huzur mene aapse sach hi to kaha tha, ab aapako puraa puraa yakeen ho gaya hoga
 Jalaluddin Akbar immediately ordered Khwaja Hussain to ask Ajmeri to leave immediately from Ajmer, go to Mecca Moazma or Madina Sharif
 chunki khwaja hossain ajmeri sahab be taalluq muzarrad aadmi the, chand kaadimon ko lekar makka shareef ko ravaanaa ho gaye
 Kayam was there for a long time
 ek din kisi kaadim ne arz kii huzur badshaah ne aapako bilakusur sataaya he, kuch to sazaa dijie
 One day on the night of Khadim again and again, in the form of Jalal, Insha Allah will call us to Ajmer with his own apology
 lihaaza aapke is irshaad ke duusare hi din uske pet main sakht dard hua, tamaam tabeeb aaziz aa gaye, din bhar tadapata rahaa
 No medication was used

 Hearing this, Akbar was moved and apologized

 If someone has a right, he cannot consume it unless the other respects that right as an obligation
 is lihaaz se adhikaar or daayitv ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 Individual rights can be continued only until the institution of the state is ready to abide by the gurus' obligation to protect them
 lekin agar yah maan liya jaae ki nagarikon ke hisse main keval adhikaar aayenge or rajya ke hisse main keval daayitv, to vyavasthit or shisht naagarik jivan asambhav ho jayega
 That is why the concept of citizenship is a mixture of obligations and rights
 inamen sabase zyaada buniyadi avadharana ‘raajnneetik daayitv’ kii he jiskaa sambandh naagarik dwaara rajya ke praadhikaar ko maananaa or uske kanoonon kaa paalan karne se he
 Anarchist thinkers do not want to bind the autonomy of a person in any way, but all the thinkers except him have spent a lot of mind in understanding whether a person has political responsibilities and if they are appropriate What is the basis? kuch vidwaanon ke mutabik ‘saamaajik samjhaute’ ke tahat vyakti ko buddhisangat or naitik aadhaar par rajya ke praadhikaar kaa aadar karnaa chahie
 Some other scholars even go further to say that responsibilities, responsibilities and duties are not just a contract, but are the absolute characteristics of a stable society
 vidwaanon main is baat par khaasaa matbhed he ki raajnneetik dayitvon kii had kya honi chahie
 After all, at what point can a dutiful citizen feel free from the obligation to respect the authority of the state? Is there any point when he can claim the right to revolt by ignoring all political obligations? raajnneetik siddhant ke itihaas main jhaankane par plato kii kalam se unke shikshak or mitra sucraat kaa prakaran saamne aata he
 Socrates, who is awaiting an almost certain death sentence after being prosecuted for corrupting the youth of Athens, tells his old friend Crito why he is not ready to escape from prison
 sucraat kii daleel he ki unhone athens main rahane kaa chunaav kiya or uske naagarik hone ke naate uplabdh vishesh suvidhaayen bhogin
 For this reason, they are bound by loyalty to the law of Athens, and they want to fulfill this assurance at the cost of their lives
 sucraat kaa prakaran bataata he ki kisi sangathit samudaay main rahane ke laabhon ko bhogane ke badale raajnneetik dayitvon ko nibhaana padataa he
 Socrates' understanding of political responsibility is unconditionally followed here
 yani sucraat sambandhit rajya ke charitra yaa uski prakruti kii koi jaanch nahin karte
 They also assume that if a resident is dissatisfied with the state, then he can go to live in another state as per his wish
 sucraat kaa yah drushtikon kai tarah se samasyagrast he
 For example, in practice it does not depend on the will of the citizens in which state they prefer to live
 pehali baat to yah ki aarthik fasaav unhen apane rajya ko chhodane se roktaa he, duusare agar rajya na chaahe to bhi ve uski seemaa chhod kar nahin ja sakate
 Secondly, the birth citizen does not make any promise to the state that it will perform such obligations
 haan, is tarah kaa likhit aashwaasan naagarikta praapt karne vaale ko zarur dena padataa he
 Thinkers such as Hobbes and Locke have in their own way described the right of the state to rule based on the consent of the ruled
 chunki buddhisangat vyakti ‘prakrut avasthaa’ kii barbar sthiti main nahin rahanaa chahega, isliye vah swechha se saamaajik samjhaute jaise anubandh main utarataa he or shanti-vyavastha ke tahat jeene ke liye rajya ke praadhikaar kaa anupaalan karne ke liye taiyaar hota he
 In both of these scholars, Locke's idea seems more balanced than Hobbes's
 hobbs ke mutabik vyakti ke saamne koi chaara hi nahin he : use yaa to rajya ke sarvasattavadi praadhikaar kii maatahati sweekaar kerani hogi, yaa phir vyaktigat hiton kii nirantar chalane vaali galakatu hode main fas kar nasht ho janaa hoga
 Locke combines the concept of political liability with not one, but two agreements
 pehla anubandh saamaajik samjhauta he jiske tahat samaaj kii rachana karne kaa paraspar samjhauta karnaa anivaary he
 For this, they will be ready to sacrifice every part of their freedom so that they can get stability and security under the subordination of a political community
 doosraa anubandh samaaj or sarkaar ke bich ek ‘bharose’ ke rup main hoga jiske tahat sarkaar nagarikon ko unke prakritik adhikaron kii suraksha kaa bharosa thamayegi
 Locke states that if the state becomes autocratic or totalitarian, then the individual has the right to rebel against it, ignoring his obligation to obey his laws
 yahan lock spasht karte hai ki vidroh kaa matlab sarkaar ko khatm karke ‘prakrut avasthaa’ kii taraf lautnaa nahin ho saktaa, balki behatar sarkaar kii sthapana hi ho saktaa he
 In a different interpretation of the principle of social settlement, Rousseau shows it in the mirror of his famous formulation 'public will'
 agar koi naagarik swechha se kisi samaaj kaa sadsy he or vah us samaaj dwaara pratipaadit jan-ichha kaa bhi hissaa he to uske aadhaar par use raajnneetik daayitv kaa paalan karnaa hoga
 Here public will means the representation of the real interest of every member of society
 zaahir he ki ruso kii sthapana daayitv ke siddhant ko sahmati aadhaarit shashan ke aagrah se dur le jaati he
 Two alternatives to the social settlement theory of political responsibility have also been suggested
 pehla vikalp raajnneetik daayitv kii prayojanamulak samaj par tikaa hua he
 According to this, the orders of the state can be complied by the citizen only in the proportion in which the state can benefit or fulfill its purpose
 upyogetavaad ek aisi hi prayojanamulak thiyari he jiske anusaar nagarikon ko sarkaar kaa ajnapaalan isliye karnaa chahie ki vah logon kii ‘sarvaadhik sankhya’ ko ‘sarvaadhik sukh’ pradaan karne kaa prayaas karti he
 The second option assumes that a person is a 'natural' member of a society, so his political obligations should also be considered 'natural'
 yah vichaar kuch-kuch sucraat kii samaj se miltaa-julata he
 Conservative thinkers have particularly liked this option
 anudaarvaadiyon ke anusaar parivaar, carch or sarkaar jaisi sansthaayen kisi vyakti kii ichha ke aadhaar par nahin balki samaaj ko nairantary dene kii aavashyaktaa ke tahat rachi gayi hai
 These institutions raise, nurture and educate the person and build his personality
 isliye vyakti ko unke prati daayitv, karttavya or jimmedaariyaan mahasoos kerani chahie
 For this, it is not enough to just follow the law and respect the freedom of others, but one should also take the responsibility of taking public positions according to the need while respecting the authority
 is tarah anudaarpanthi chintak vyakti ke raajnneetik dayitvon ko mata-pita ke prati unki santanon ke daayitv kaa darja de dete hai
 Socialists and socialists have emphasized the social aspect of obligations
 is lihaaz se ve udaarataavaadiyon ke mukaable naagarik par gurutar daayitv daalana chaahate hai
 They want that the person should not only work for the community, but also for those who cannot work for any reason
 keval adhikarasmpann or daayitvaheen vyaktiyon ke samaaj main matsay-nyaay kii sthitiyaan haaavee ho jaayengi
 Communist anarchist thinkers like this argument very much
 prudhon, bakunin or kropatakin jaise ksalikal araajaktaavaadi raajnneetik praadhikaar ko to kaarij karte hai, par ummid karte hai ki ek swasth samaaj main log saamaajikta, paraspar sahyog or shisht vyavhaar kii kuubiyon las honge
 Marxists have completely rejected the concept of political responsibility, because they do not have an interest in the state's protection of the rights of the individual
 vah to vargeey shashan kaa auzaar hota he
 Marxists call the theory of social settlement as 'ideological'
 yani unke anusaar is siddhant kaa makasad nagarikon ko shaasha varg kii maatahati main laana he
 It is clear from Locke's installations that his understanding of political responsibility also leads to the theory of revolution
 1776 kii america kranti ke dauraan 13 purv british upniveshon dwaara kii gayi baghaavat main shaamil krantikariyon ne lock kii 1690 main prakashit rachana tu treetaise on civil government main vyakt vichaaron kaa kaafii istemaal kiya tha
 On this basis, Locke supported England's 'glorious Revolution' against the rule of the Stuart kings, which resulted in the establishment of a constitutional monarchy and opened the way for the development of parliamentary democracy

 In order to get rid of the sin of cow slaughter, Gautam Rishi took a severe penance and asked Shiva a boon to incarnate Ganga here
 falswaroop dakshin kii ganga arthath godavari nadi kaa udgam hua
 After the origin of Godavari, after the persuasion of Gautama Rishi, Shivji accepted to sit in this temple
 teen netron vaale shivashambhu ke yahan virajman hone ke kaaran is jagah ko tryambak kaha jane laga
 Like Ujjain and Omkareshwar, Trimbakeshwar Maharaj is considered the king of this village, so every Monday the king of Trimbakeshwar goes out to visit the city to know the condition of his subjects
 is jyotirling kii sthapana ke vishay main shivpurana main yah katha varnit he- Once the wives of Brahmins living in Maharishi Gautama's Tapovan got angry with his wife Ahilya on something
 unhone apane patiyon ko rishi gautam kaa apkaar karne ke liye prerit kiya
 Those Brahmins worshiped Lord Shree Ganeshji for this
 unki aradhana se prasann ho ganeshji ne prakat hokar unase var maangane ko kaha un brahmanon ne kaha- 'prabho! yadi aap ham par prasann hai to kisi prakaar rishi gautam ko is ashram se baahar nikaal den
 On hearing this, Ganeshji persuaded him to ask for such a bridesmaid
 kintu ve apane aagrah par atal rahe
 Eventually Ganeshji was forced to obey him
 apane bhakton kaa man rakhane ke liye ve ek durbal gaay kaa rup dhaaran karke rishi gautam ke khet main jaakar rahane lage
 Seeing the cow grazing the crop, the sage took a straw in his hand with great softness and grabbed it to grab it
 un trinon kaa sparsh hote hi vah gaay vahiin marakar gir padi
 Now there was a big cry
 saare brahman ekatra ho go-hatyara kahkar rishi gautam kii bhartsana karne lage
 Rishi Gautam was very surprised and saddened by this incident
 ab un saare brahmanon ne kaha ki tumhen yah ashram chhodkar anyatra kahin dur chale janaa chahie
 Staying close to the cow-killer will also cause us sin
 vivash hokar rishi gautam apni patni ahilya ke saath vahaan se ek kos dur jaakar rahane lage
 But those Brahmins made their stay there too difficult
 ve kehane lage- 'go-hatya ke kaaran tumhen ab veda-paath or yagyadi ke kaary karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin rah gaya
 'sage Gautama prayed to the Brahmins that you guys should give me some measure of my atonement and salvation
 tab unhone kaha- 'gautam! tum apane paap ko sarvatra sabko bataate hue teen baar puri prithvi kii parikrama karo
 Then return and fast here for a month
 iske baad 'brahmagiri' kii 101 parikrama karne ke baad tumhaari shuddhi hogi athwa yahan gangaji ko laakar unke jal se snaan karke ek karod parthiv shivlingon se shivaji kii aradhana karo
 After this, bathe in Gangaji again and revolve this Brahmagiri 11 times
 phir sau ghadon ke pavitra jal se parthiv shivlingon ko snaan karaane se tumhaara uddhaar hoga
 According to the Brahmins, Maharishi Gautama, after completing all those tasks, became fully engrossed with his wife and started worshiping Lord Shiva
 isse prasann ho bhagwaan shiv ne prakat hokar unase var maangane ko kaha
 Maharishi Gautam said to him- 'lord, i want you to free me from the sin of cow-slaughter
 ' bhagavan shiv ne kaha- 'gautam ! tum sarvatha nishpaap ho
 The crime of cow slaughtering was done fraudulently on you
 chal purvak aisa karwaane vaale tumhaare ashram ke brahmanon ko main dand dena chahta hoon
 ' is par maharishi gautam ne kaha ki prabhu! unheen ke nimitt se to mujhe aapkaa darshan praapt hua he
 Now consider them as my supreme interest and do not be angry with them
 ' bahut se rishiyon, muniyon or dev ganon ne vahaan ekatra ho gautam kii baat kaa anumodan karte hue bhagavan shiv se sadaa vahaan nivas karne kii prarthana kii

 - The legend shivaratri or sawan somvaar ke din tryambakeshwar mandir main bhakton kaa taanta laga rahata he
 Devotees take a bath at dawn and see their worship

 Trimbakeshwar village is very close to Nashik

 Yoga tradition and scriptures have a long history, although a lot of its history has been destroyed

 After Lord Shankar, yoga is considered to be started from the Vedic sages
 baad main krishna, mahavir or buddha ne ise apni tarah se vistaar diya
 After this, Patanjali gave it a streamlined form
 is rup ko hi aage chalakar siddhapanth, shivapanth, nathpanth vaishnav or shakt panthiyon ne apane-apane tareeke se vistaar diya
 That is, without yoga, even a yajna of a scholar is not proven
 vah yoga kya he? yoga chittavritiyon kaa nirodh he, vah kartavya karmmaatr main vyaapt he
 That is, the same God should be oriented towards our Samadhi, by his mercy we will benefit Samadhi, Vivek, Khyatmya and Ritambhara Pragya, but the same God should come towards us with perfections etc

 The authentic Yogasutra of Yoga, 200 BC It is the first well-organized treatise on Yoga
 hindu, jain or buddha dharm main yoga kaa alag-alag tareeke se vargeekaran kiya gaya he
 The origin of all this has been the Vedas and Upanishads
 vaidic kaal main yajna or yoga kaa bahut mahatv tha
 For this, he had arranged a system of four ashrams
 brahmacharya ashram main vedon kii shiksha ke saath hi shastr or yoga kii shiksha bhi di jaati thi
 1500 BC to the Rigveda
 From 1000 BC Is believed to have been written between
 isse purv vedon ko kanthsth karakar hajaaron varshon tak smriti ke aadhaar par sangrakshit rakhaa gaya tha
 According to the belief of Indian philosophy, the Vedas have been considered as inauspicious, that is, the Vedas are the voice of God and are considered to be about two billion years old
 inaki pracheenta ke bare main anya mat bhi hai
 Osho considers the Rigveda to be about 90 thousand years old

 Patanjali correctly classified the yogic knowledge scattered in the Veda

 Among the many notations of Sanskrit criticism, ornamentation is the most popular designation
 iske pracheen naamon main kriyalap vatsyayan dwaara nirdisht 64 kalaon main se anyatam he
 The naming "sahitya Vidya" mentioned by Rajasekhar depends on the Indian imagination of poetry, but these nomenclature could not become famous
 "alankarishastra" main alankaar shabd kaa prayog vyapak tathaa sankeern donon arthon main samajhnaa chahie
 The two meanings of the ornament are valid - vyapak arth sweekaar karne par alankarishastra kavyasobhaa ke aadhaek samast tatwon - gun, reeti, ras, vritti dhwani aadi--kaa vijaek shaastra he jisamen in tatwon ke swaroop tathaa mahatv kaa ruchir vivaran prastut kiya gaya he
 The name expresses its historical significance when taken in a narrow sense
 sahityashastra ke aarambhik yug main "alankaar" hi kavy kaa sarvasv mana jaataa tha jiske abhaav main kavy ushntahin agni ke samaan nishpraan or nirjeev hota he
 Critical analysis of "ornamentation" gave rise to the element of "quibble" on the one hand and a review of the meaning on the other gave a clear indication of the principle of "sound"
 isliye ras, dhwani, gun aadi kavyatatvon kaa pratipadak hone par bhi, alankaar praadhanya drushti ke kaaran hi, aalochanashastra kaa naam "alankarishastra" padaa or vah lokapriy bhi hua
 The achievement of ornaments, especially the metaphor, metaphor, utterance and exaggeration, is certainly found in the mantras of the Rigveda, but there is no evidence of the emergence of this scripture in the Vedic age
 nirukt ke anushilan se "upama" kaa saahitiyik vishleshan yask se purvavarti yug kii aalochana kii parinat fal prathit hota he
 Yasak has not only instructed the epithet of any ancient Acharya, he has also described the fundamental metaphor-types like Pratyapat Karmopama, Bhootopama, Roopopama, Siddhopama, Arthopama: Parasantpur: Sir
 isse spasht he ki alankaar kaa udai yask se bhi purv ho chukaa tha
 The names of Kashyapa and Varruchi, Brahmadatta and Nandiswami, Tarunavachaspati, have taken place among the adorned figures, but their texts and opinions are not known
 rajasekhar dwaara "kavyamimasaa" main nirdisht brihaspati, upamanyu, suvarnanabh, prachethayan, shesh, pulasthya, parashar, utathy aadi ashtadash aacharyon main se keval bharat kaa "naatyashaastra" hi aajkal uplabdh he
 Other Acharyas hold only imaginary power
 itnaa to nishchit he ki unani aalochana ke udai shatabdiyon purv "alankarishastra" pramanik shaastrapaddati ke rup main pratishthit ho chukaa tha
