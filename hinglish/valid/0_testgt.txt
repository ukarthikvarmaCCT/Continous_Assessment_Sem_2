 is film ke liye dhwani pruthak gramophone record par aalekhith thi or is record ko chalchitr dikhaate samay saath-saath bajaayaa jaataa tha jisase chalchitr ke saath hi dhwani bhi sunai pade
 Nowadays the marking of sound in movies is also on one side of the film
 dhwani ankan prarambh main to photography dwaara hi hota tha parantu aadhunik kaal main adhik jhukaav chumbakeey aalekhan kii ore he
 There are two methods used for photography by sound marking
 inamen se ek vidhi he parivarti kshetrafal vidhi tathaa duusari vidhi he parivarti ghanatv vidhi 
 The basic principle of both these methods is the same, that is, the cinematography that varies with sound is on one side of the film
 aajkal adhik prachlan parivarti kshetrafal vidhi kaa he
 With the help of a variable field method, the sound that has to be written converts it into electromagnetic waves with the help of a microphone
 in vidyucchumbakeey tanragon ko pravardhak kii sahaayta se pravardhit karte hai
 Apart from amplification, many other signs of sound, such as intensity, etc
 are controlled here
 iske baad dhwani ke vidyucchumbakeey sanketon ko ek dharamapi par dete hai jisase dharamapi kaa darpan idhar udhar dolan karata he
 The light of a stationary intensity source of light is focused on the mirror by an optical system
 darpan se paravartit hone par yah prakaash ek anya prakaashik sanyantr se hota hua film kii pattee par padataa he or yahan uskaa chhayankan hota he
 When the electromagnetic signal falls on the dielectric, corresponding to the frequency and intensity of the sound on the microphone, its mirror oscillations are also related to this sound change
 darpan ke dolan ke kaaran prakaash, jo is darpan se paravartit hota he tathaa prakaashik sanyantron se gujarata hua film par padataa he, bhinn bhinn kshetrafal main chhayankan karata he
 Here the change in area is due to the sound falling on the microphone, so this change is also compatible with that sound
 yahan dhwani chhayankan main kalimaa kii maatra sarvatra samaan rahati he, keval kaale kshetrafal kii tivrata main parivartan hota he, at: is vidhi ko parivarti kshetrafal vidhi kehete hai
 With the variable density method, the light of a light source of constant intensity falls on a light valve that transmits more or less light according to the given signal
 is valve par microphone dwaara utpann tathaa pravardhak dwaara pravardhit sanket die jate hai
 As a result, the intensity of the light coming out of this valve changes according to the sound on the microphone
 jab yah prakaash film par chhayankan karata he, tab yadhyapi chhayankan kaa kshetrafal samaan rahata he, tathaapi iske kaalepan ke ghanatv main parivartan hota he, at: is vidhi ko parivarti ghanatv vidhi kehete hai
 The principle of sound reproduction is almost the opposite of sound drafting
 film kii pattee, jisapar dhwani kaa aalekhan chaaya ke rup main he ek drum ke upar se guzarati he
 The function of this drum is only to remove possible irregularities of motion of the film
 sthir tivrata ke prakashasrot se nikalanevaala prakaash prakaashik sanyantr dwaara kendrit hokar ek sankeern rekhachhidr se hota hua film ke dhvanichhyankit bhaag par padataa he
 The intensity of the light passing through it changes according to the blackness of the soundtrack
 yah parivartan spashtatya microphone par padanevaali dhwani ke anuroop hoga
 Thus, light of variable intensity falls on a light-electro-cell, or photosol
 is photocel ke paripath main ek vidyudwara utpann hoti he jisamen photocel par aaptit prakaash kii tivrata ke anuroop parivartan hota he
 The electromagnetic signals that are generated in the photocell circuit by this variable current are amplified by the amplifier and then pass those signals onto a loudspeaker, which is placed behind the screen
 in pravardhit sanketon ke kaaran laudspikar se jo dhwani utpann hoti he vah us dhwani ke hi anuroop hoti he jo microphone par pad rahi thi
 The reproduction of sound in the above shading method is not very high quality
 yadhyapi is vidhi se jo aalekhan, chalchitr studio main hota hai, vah tab bhi adhik ucch koti kaa ho saktaa he, tathaapi chalchitr pradarshnagrihon main dhwani kaa punarutpaadan utani ucch koti kaa nahin ho saktaa
 The reproduced sound often had a frequency limit of 7,000
 parantu is vidhi kaa ek bada laabh yah tha ki prakaashik chhayankan hone ke kaaran ise film kii pattee par chitra chhapane ke saath hi chapa ja saktaa tha
 Scientists resorted to magnetic sound graphs and reproduction methods to overcome the difficulties of light method
 is vidhi kaa siddhant tepe recorder ke siddhant jaisaa hi he
 The sound that has to be written is first amplified by an amplifier by converting it into electromagnetic waves with the help of a microphone
 tatpashchaat in pravardhit sanketon ko ek vidyucchumbak ke kundal main bhejte hai
 The value of the current in this coil changes according to the received signals and the magnetic intensity of the electromagnet also changes according to the value of this current
 is vidyucchumbak ke donon dhruvon ke bich kii duuri atyant kam hoti he, at: unke bich chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata bahut adhik hoti he or iske kundalon main pravaahit honevaali dhara main parivartan se kshetra kii tivrata main adhik parivartan bhi hota he
 a tape passes very close to this electric magnet, which is coated with a magnetic material, such as iron oxide
 vidyut chumbak ke sammukh se guzarate samay is tepe par lepit chumbakeey padaarth ke chumbakeey gunon main parivartan hota he, jo vidyucchumbak ke chumbakatv main parivartan ke anuroop hota he or chunki vidyucchumbak ke chumbakatv main parivartan microphone par padanevaali dhwani ke anuroop hota he, at: tepe ke chumbakeey gunon main parivartan bhi microphone par padanevaali dhwani ke anuroop hota he
 This method allows magnetic grafting of sound on the tape
 purutpaadan ke liye jab yahi tepe kisi vidyucchumbak ke sammukh chalaaya jaataa he, tab uske kudalon main pravaahit honevaali dhara main tadnurup parivartan hota he
 This change of current is amplified by an amplifier and delivered to the loudspeaker to reproduce the sound
 film par is vidhi se aalekhan ke liye aavashyak he ki film ke ek kinare par kisi chumbakeey padaarth kaa lep ho
 Also for reproduction in the display house, a magnetic head will be needed in place of photons and photocell
 aadhunik samay main anek chalchitron ke pradarshan kaa aakaar saadhaaran chitra se bhinn hota he
 The methods used under the names Cinemascope, Cinerama, vistavision etc
 have a much wider picture width
 is vidhi ke saath yadi upar varnit dhwani-punarutpaadan-vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaae, jisamen ek hi laudspikar kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, to ek kathinaayee yah utpann hoti he ki parde par dhwani kaa strot chaahe yaa daayen sire par, yaa baayein sire par, yaa bich main kahin bhi ho, dhwani sadaiv ek si sthaan se aati hui prathit hogi, jahaan laudspikar rakhaa he
 If several loudspeakers are placed in parallel in this method, which are distributed across the width of the curtain, the same sound will be heard from the entire screen even though the speaker is somewhere in one place
 is kathinaayee ko dur karne ke liye steriophonic dhwani yantra kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In this method, many microphones are used at different locations during sound recording, which usually range from four to seven
 prayek microphone se utpann sanketon ko pruthak pruthak pravardhit karte hai tathaa unhen aalekhan pattee par alag alag aalekhith karte hai
 Thus, sound drafting takes place on many tracks and is called very track recording
 punarutpaadan ke samay bhi alag alag chumbakeey head se alag alag trek ke aalekhan ko vidyucchumbakeey sanketon main parivartit karte hai phir unhen pruthak pruthak pravardhakon se pravardhit karte hai
 Finally, these signals are delivered to different loudspeakers
 prayek laudspikar is prakaar rakhaa jaataa he ki uski sthiti sangat microphone kii sthiti ke anuroop ho
 For example, if a microphone is placed on the leftmost corner of the stage while the sound is being written, the loudspeaker that reproduces that sound will also be placed left behind the curtain
 isi prakaar anya laudspikar bhi sangat microphonon ke anusaar vitarit honge
 Now imagine that the sound is produced at the left end of the stage at the time of sound plotting, then the intensity of the sound will be greater in the microphone placed there and the intensity will gradually decrease in the farther away microphone
 chunki aalekhan or punarutpaadan kaal main sabase bain ore rakhe laudspikar se tivratam dhwani utpann hogi or kramash: dur ke laudspikar kramash: halaki dhwani utpann karenge
 Therefore, the viewer will appear to be coming from the left side of the sound curtain
 isi prakaar dhwani aalekhan kaal main stage ke jis bhaag main dhwani utpann hogi, uske nikatatam rakhe hue microphone main sanket tivratam hoga tathaa punarutpaadan kaal main usee ke sangat laudspikar se mahattam dhwani utpann karegaa
 Therefore, the sound will also appear to come from the same part of the picture, where the sound seems to be produced
 jitne hi adhik tathaa spasht trek honge utana hi vaastavik dhwani punarutpaadan hoga
 But up to seven tracks are used experimentally keeping in mind the expense and practical difficulties

 These are often not used in a 'linear state'
 Switching times range from tens of nanoseconds to a few hundred microseconds, depending on the device
 MOSFET drain source resistances increase as more current flows through the device
 As frequencies increase the losses increase as well, making bjts more attractive
 Power mosfets can be paralleled in order to increase switching current and therefore overall switching power
 Nominal voltages for MOSFET switching devices range from a few volts to a little over 1000 V, with currents up to about 100 a or so
 Newer devices may have higher operational characteristics
 MOSFET devices are not bi-directional, nor are they reverse voltage blocking
 An example of this new device from ABB shows how this device improves on GTO technology for switching high voltage and high current in power electronics applications
 According to ABB, the IGCT devices are capable of switching in excess of 5000 VAC and 5000 a at very high frequencies, something not possible to do efficiently with GTO devices

 Anand is a 1971 Hindi language film
 is film ke nirmaataa, nirdeshak, lekhak evam sampadak rishikesh mukherjee hai
 The lead actors of this film are Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan
 is film ko rashtriya film puraskaar main sarvshereshth film ke alaava filmafere puraskaron main chah shreniyon main puraskrit kiya gaya tha
 The film begins from the present and Dr
 Bhaskar Banerjee, an expert in cancer, is being awarded the literary award that he created a novel like Anand and Dr
 Bhaskar Banerjee in his cleanliness says that it is some pages of his diary And he is not an author and this novel is based on true events
 ab film ateet main chali jaati he jab ek jujharu doctor bhaskar bannerjee mumbai kii jhoparpatti main marizon kii dekhbhaal kar rahaa he or dekhtaa he ki bhukhmaree or badahaali is had tak faili huyi he ki vah kisi ke liye kuch bhi karne main aksham he
 At the same time, his friend Dr
 Prakash Kulkarni has a frozen hospital, which also sees the sick patients and gets good amount of money from them while the poor patient, who keeps sending Bhaskar, gets all the tests done without any money
 ek din prakaash ko dilli se uske ek stri rog visheshgy dost dow trivedi kaa khat aata he ki vah apane dost anand ko uske paas bhej rahaa he
 Prakash met Anand a few years ago and became his good friend
 anand ko antadiyon kaa cancer he or yah baat vah jaanata he ki zyaada se zyaada vah chah maheene hi zindaa rahegaa
 When Prakash and Bhaskar are sitting in Prakash's office, Anand threatens and starts his joking habit, which makes Bhaskar Banerjee angry and he asks Anand that he knows what
 If there is sickness, Anand tells him that he has cancer and that he will live for six months at most
 yah sunakar bhaskar anand kaa qaayal ho jaataa he ki yah maaloom hote huye bhi ki vah kuch hi dinon kaa mahamaan he, anand itnaa zindadil he
 Anand now lives at Bhaskar's house and somehow discovers that Bhaskar loves a girl Renu but does not dare to express this love
 anand ek pahalwaan kii madad se renu kii maan se milakar bhaskar or renu kaa rishta pakkaa karvaa letaa he lekin renu kii maan ko yah bataa detaa he ki bhaskar or renu kii shaadi main vah nahin rahegaa
 Meanwhile, Anand also finds Isa Bhai Suratwala, an artist working in the theater and Anand learns some dialogues and tapes them in Bhaskar's tape recorder
 ab anand kii tabiyat din par din girti jaati he or ek din vah bistar par let jaataa he
 Bhaskar goes to a homoeopathic doctor in search of some charisma and leaves Prakash and Renu to take care of the joy behind him but by the time he returns, the joy is dead and the joyful taped dialogue in the background
 It is going on and this is where the film ends

 gitarahasya naamak pustak kii rachana lokmaanya balgangadhar tilak ne mandla jail main kii thi
 In this, he elaborated on the Karmayoga of Srimad Bhagavad Gita
 unhone is granth ke madhyam se bataaya ki gita chintan un logon ke liye nahin he jo swarthpurna sansaarik jivan bitaane ke baad avkaash ke samay khaali baith kar pustak padhane lagate hai
 In the Gita mystique lies the philosophical how we should perform worldly duties while looking towards liberation
 is granth main unhone manushya ko uske sansar main vaastavik kartavyon kaa bodh karaayaa he
 Tilak had written Geetarasya only because he could not believe that a book like Geeta only leads to salvation
 usamen keval sansar chhod dene kii apil he
 He wanted to bring karma to the center
 vahi shaayad us samay kii maang thi
 When the country is a slave, you cannot talk to your people about salvation
 unhen to karm main lagaana hota he
 Tilak did the same
 gandhiji to gita ke atyant prashansak the
 He called her his mother
 unhone bhi gitarahasya ko pard kar kaha tha ki gita par tilkaji kii yah tikaa hi unka shaashvat smarak he
 Writing Geetarasya on one hand and beginning to celebrate Ganapati Bappa's festival on the other hand were the masterstrokes of Tilak Maharaj
 agrejon kii gulaami kaa daur tha
 November of 1910 was just beginning
 tabake burma kii mandley jail main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilak kaid the
 At the same time, one morning he realized that the time has come for the Gita on which he wanted to write
 apane dhuandhar raajnneetik jivan se unhen koi samay mil nahin paata tha
 But whenever he was in jail, Geeta would come in his mind
 vah gita se behad prabhavit the
 But he used to get upset about his wife
 apane samay or samaaj ke mutabik gita ko dekhnaa or samajhnaa chaahate the
 In order to awaken a tired slave society he wanted to make Geeta live
 jab unhen teesri badi jail hui, to unhone us par kaam shuru kar diya
 The work, whose foundation may have been on his mind long ago
 16 saal kii umr main apane maranasann pita ko marathi main gita sunai thi
 Since then, there was a kind of attachment to Gita
 baad main jab dhire-dhire umr pakane lagi or samaj badhane lagi, to gita ke tamaam rahasy khulne lage
 He had a problem that all the commentaries of Gita were about to take away from the world i
e
 the path of retirement
 or tilak kaa man yah maanane ko taiyaar hi nahin tha ki gita jaisi kitaab aapako mahaj moksh kii ore le jane vaali he
 After all, how can Geeta Nire talk of salvation to prepare Arjuna for battle! That is why he said, "the original Gita is not retirement-oriented
 vah to karm pradhan he
 " gitarahasya ko mahaj paanch maheene main pencil se hi unhone likh daalaa tha
 At one time it seemed that the British government might seize his writings
 lekin unhen apni yaaddaasht par bahut bharosa tha
 That is why he said to his brothers, "there is no reason to fear
 haalanki bahiyaan sarkaar ke paas hai
 But even in my mind every word of the scripture is there
 vishram ke samay apane bangale main baithkar main use phir se likh daaloongaa

 The discovery of sea feni or cuttlefish, or fish in the intestines of fossils, suggests that they used to eat fish
 sambhavat: ye apane shishuon kaa bhi bhakshan karte the
 At one time it was thought that mines were made from the development of fishes, but now it is certain that they are made from terrestrial reptiles in such a way that their terrestrial nature is completely destroyed and adapted to aquatic life

 It is believed that on this day Lord Shiva appeared in the form of Jyotirlinga

 But Arfa refuses him
 sultan iske baad kai maheene tak bahut mehnat karata he or pahalwani ke ek muqaabale main hissaa letaa he
 Arfa and she get married soon after this competition wins and he becomes a national level wrestler

 uskaa khun o+ hota he, jo sultan kaa bhi hota he
 But due to his absence no other blood donor is found

 If the efforts of the group are to be effective, the working people need to know what is expected of them and this can only be known with the help of planning
 isiilie to kaha jaataa he ki prabhaavshaalee prabandh ke liye niyojan upkram kii samast kriyaaon main aavashyak he
 Organization, motivation, coordination and control will be of no importance without setting goals and deciding the path to reach it
 jab niyojan ke abhaav main kriyaaon kaa purvanirdhaaran nahin hoga to na to kuch kaary sanghathan ko karne ko hi hoga, na samanvay ko or na hi abhiprerana or niyantran ko
 That is why scholars have considered planning to be the most important task of management
 niyojan kii prakriya maanav sabhyataa ke prarambh se hi maujuud he, kyonki yah maanav kaa swabhaav rahaa he ki use aage kya karnaa he? isaki vah purv main kalpana karata he
 Today, its improved form is in front of us

 Apart from this, all the situations that concern it

 The nature of modern business has become very complex due to changes in competition, technology, government policy, economic activities, labor supply, raw materials and social values and beliefs
 aise parivartansheel vaataavaran main niyojan ke aadhaar par hi vyavsaayik safalataa kii aashaa kii ja sakati hai
 Development of planning is an important requirement of every undertaking in today's era
 vyavsaayik barbaadi, durupyog va, jokhimon ko niyojan ke dwaara hi kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The need and importance of planning can be explained on the basis of the following points: niyojan kaa uparyukt mahatv hote hue bhi kuch vidwaan ise 'samay evam dhan kii barbaadi athwa 'barsaati ole' kahkar iskaa virodh karte hai
 He says that business plans are prepared against the backdrop of uncertain and volatile circumstances
 jab inkaa aadhaar hi anishchit he to phir yah kai se mana ja saktaa he ki niyojan dwaara nirdhaarit baaten sadaiv shat-pratishat satya hi hongi
 The root cause of this protest is due to the various difficulties and limitations in planning, due to which it is criticized in harsh words
 inkaa sankshipt vivaran is prakaar he- Planning can be of many types
 saamanyatya niyojan ko nimnlikhit virgon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he : Depending on the duration, planning can be of three types: dirdhakalin niyojan santhaan ke iraadon evam apekshaaon kaa vaastavik pratinidhi kaha ja saktaa he
 It is easy to adjust to the changes in the environment and it accelerates the development of the enterprise
 iske alaava yah shodh evam anusandhan ko protsaahan degaa
 Its drawback is - long duration is difficult to predict, expensive system and difficult to analyze the effects of all elements
 prakruti ke aadhaar par niyojan ko do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he- They remain useful for a long time
 inkaa nirdhaaran purv main kar liya jaataa he, taaki sanghathan ke kriyakalapon ko vyavastha pradaan karne ke aadhaar ke rup main kaam liya ja sake
 These increase the firm's credibility
 str ke aadhaar par niyojan ko teen bhaagon main bota ja saktaa he : Depending on the importance, planning can be divided into three parts: niyojan prakriya se aashay aisi prakriya se he jiske anusaran karne se ek prabhaavshaalee niyojan kaa nirmaan sambhav he
 Although a common process of planning for all types of enterprises cannot be determined, the following process can be followed in a rational business planning: uddeshy sanstha ke sadhano ko dhyaan main rakhkar nishchit kiye jane chahie tathaa vebodhgamy evam vaastavik hone chahie
 Objectives are the target points of the work to be done and determine the path of desired results
 nirdhaaran ke baad in uddeshyon kii jaankaree sambandhit vibhaagon evam karmchaariyon ko di jaani chahie taaki veyojana nirmaan main sahyog de saken
