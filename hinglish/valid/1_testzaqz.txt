 She used to import and market all types of medicines in India; Especially low-cost generics and very valuable specialty medicines
 When the Indian government introduced a process of prohibiting rectangles of export goods, these multipurpose companies set up manufacturing units and continued to import multimodal medicines

 However, the feature became widely known only when it was used by Gmail and Google Maps
 yah shabd "ajaks" san 2005 main aayaa
 The word "ajax" came to Jesse James Garrett's mind when he was taking a bath, at the time he felt the need for an abbreviated form of representation of technologies for a customer
 5 april 2006 world wide web concortium ne ek adhikarik web maanak ke nirmaan ke liye object ke liye pehla draft vivaran jari kiya
 The term Ajax represents a large set of web technologies that are used to implement a web application that communicates with a server in the background, in the meantime it does not interfere with the current state of the page is

 In particular it is noted that: anya bhashaaen jaise vbscript bhi aavashyak kaaryakshmata ke yogya he
 However, Java Script is the most popular language for Ajax programming, as it is compatible with and included with most modern web browsers
 clasical ajaks main graahak par tadarth java script kaa lekhan shaamil he
 An easy and cruder option is used for standard Java Script libraries that partially update the page, such as the update panel of asp
net
 Tools such as Echo2 and ZK enable fine grained control of a page from the server using only standard Java Script libraries

 However, using Ajax, a web application only requests content that needs to be updated, thus greatly reducing bandwidth usage and load time
 upyogkarta anuprayog ko adhik tej or adhik pratikriyasheel banaate hai, yahaan tak ki tab bhi jab anuprayog sarwar ke paksh par badla nahin he
 Nearby tasks include the use of invisible iframes, which change the history of the browser and change the anchor part of the URL when Ajax is running and control it for changes
