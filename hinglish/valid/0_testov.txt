 Some tribes also sheltered or adopted white traders and absconding slaves and slaves owned by Native Americans
 jin kabeelon kaa europea logon ke saath vyapaar kaa lanbaa itihaas rahaa he, ve europea adhimishran kii ek ucch dar pradarshit karte hai, jo europea purushon va america mul-nivasee mahilaon ke bich antarjaatiy vivaah ke varshon ko pratibimbit karti he
 Thus many avenues of genetic diversity existed among Native Americans
 haalanki kuch tippaneekaron ke anusaar haalia varshon main america mul-nivaasiyon or africa americanyon ke bich adhimishran kii daren ucch raheen hai, lekin anuvaanshik vanshavali visheshgyon ne paaya ki isaki aavriti kam hui he
 Literary critic and author Henry Lewis Gates, Jr
 refers to experts who argue that only 5 per African Americans have at least 12
5 percent Native American ancestry
 spasht rup se iskaa arth yah hua ki bahut adhik pratishat logon main paitrukataa kaa pratishat bahut kam ho saktaa he, lekin yah suzav bhi diya jaataa he ki adhimishran ke puraane akalan bahut ucch rahe hon
 chunki kuch anuvaanshik pareekshan keval pratyaksh purush yaa mahila purvajon kaa hi moolyankan karte hai, atah sambhav he ki vyakti apane anya purvajon ke madhyam se america mul-nivasee paitrukataa ko na khoj sake
 kisi vyakti ke 64 4xparaxaxaom main se, pratyaksh pareekshan keval 2 kaa diene pramaan pradaan karata he
 In addition to these limitations, if only direct male and female lineages are tested, DNA testing cannot be used to determine tribal membership because it cannot discriminate between Native American communities
 Native American identity has historically been based on culture, not just biology
 According to the Indigenous People's Council on Biocolonialism: "america mul-nivasee chihnak" keval america mul-nivaasiyon main nahin paae jate
 haalanki ve america mul-nivaasiyon main adhik paae jate hai, lekin ve vishwa ke anya bhaagon ke logon main bhi milte hai
 Geneticists also say that: sabhi america mul-nivaasiyon kaa pareekshan, vishesh rup se chechak jaisi bimariyon se badi sankhya main hui mauton ke liye, kiya ja chukaa he, is baat kii sambhaavna nahin he ki america mul-nivaasiyon main keval ve anuvaanshik chihnak hai, jinaki pahchaan kii ja chuki he, bhale hi unki maatruk yaa paitruk vanshavali main koi gaiyr-america mulnivaasee shaamil na ho
 To receive tribal services, a Native American person must be a member of a tribal organization and certified by it
 Each tribal government makes its own rules for citizens and tribal members
 sangheey sarkaar ke sevaaon se sambandhit maanak pramanit america mul-nivaasiyon ke liye uplabdh hote hai
 For example, a federal scholarship for Native Americans requires that the student be enrolled in a federally-recognized clan and have at least one-quarter of Native American ancestry, a certificate of degree of Indian Attested by a blood card
 Among tribes, eligibility depends on the required percentage of Native American "blood", or "blood volume" in a person seeking recognition
 nischitata praapt karne ke liye, kuch kabeelon ne vanshavali vishyak diene pareekshan ko aavashyak bananaa shuru kar diya he, lekin saamanytah yah kisi pramanit sadsy se pitrutv yaa pratyaksh vansh-parampara ko sabit karne se sambandhit hota he
 The requirements for tribal membership vary widely according to tribes
 sheroki kabeelon ke liye yah aavashyak he ki pracheen 1906 dawes rolls main soochibaddh kisi america mul-nivasee se vanshavali vishyak paitrukataa lekhabaddh ho
 ek se adhik kabeelon kii paitrukataa se sambandhit sadasyon kii manyata ke niyam bhi samaan rup se vividh or jatil hai
 Tribal membership conflicts have resulted in numerous legal disputes, court cases, and the establishment of activist groups
 iskaa ek udhaaharan sheroki freedomen hai
 Today, they include the lineage of African Americans who were once enslaved by the Cherokee, who were granted citizenship as free people after the Civil War in the historic Cherokee Nation, by federal agreement
 san 1980 ke dashak main, aadhunik sheroki raashtra ne unhen naagarikta se baahar kar diya-jab tak ki vyakti dawes rolls par soochibaddh kisi sheroki america mul-nivasee se paitrukataa sabit kar saken
 In the twentieth century, an increasing number of caucasian-americans seem to be more interested in claiming paternity than Native Americans
 kai logon ne sherokiyon se vanshavali kaa daawa kiya he
 In 2006, the US The Census Bureau estimated that approximately 0

 yah elgoridm, anekon vikasaatmak kalanvidhiyon main se ek he
 Developmental algorithms are based on following techniques of evolution and related concepts
 anuvanshik elgorithm kaa kriyanvayan ek computer simulation main kiya jaataa he, jisamen ek samasya ke anukulan ke liye ummidavaar ke samaadhaan kehalaata he) ke saar pratinidhitiv yaa gunasutra kehalaata he) kii ek aabaadi behatar hal viksit karti he
 Traditionally, solutions are expressed in binary as a series of 0s and 1s, but other encodings are also possible
 vikaas aamtaur par yadrichhik rup se utpann hue vyaktiyon se shuru hota he or pidhiyon main hota he
 In each generation, the fitness of each individual is evaluated, stochastically multiple individuals are selected from the current population and modified to create a new population
 iske baad elgorithm kii agle charan main nayi aabaadi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In general, the algorithm finishes when either the maximum number of generations has been generated or a satisfactory fitness level has been attained for the population
 yadi elgorithm kii samaapti pidhiyon kii adhiktam sankhya ke kaaran hui he, to ek santoshjanak samaadhaan praapt ho saktaa he yaa nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 Genetic algorithms have applications in bioinformatics, phylogenetics, computational science, engineering, economics, chemistry, manufacturing, mathematics, physics and other fields
 ek praroopik anuvanshik elgorithm ke liye aavashyak he: a standard representation of the solution is an array of bits
 anya prakaar or saranchanaaon ke ere ko aavashyak rup se saamaan tareeke se prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
 The key feature that facilitates these genetic representations is that their parts are easily aligned due to their fixed size, which makes the simple crossover procedure easier
 char lambaai pratinidhitiv kaa bhi upyog kiya ja saktaa he, lekin is maamle main krosover kriyanvayan adhik jatil ho jaataa he
 Tree-type representations appear in genetic programming and graphs derived from representations appear in evolutionary programming
 fitness function ko anuvanshik pratinidhitiv par paribhaashit kiya jaataa he or yah pratinidhitiv ke samaadhaan kii gunvattta kaa maapan karata he
 The fitness function always depends on the problem
 udhaaharan ke liye, nepsek samasya main koi vyakti object ke kul maan ko adhiktam karnaa chahta he jise kisi nishchit kshamta ke nepsek main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The expression of a solution can be an array of bits, where each bit expresses a different object and the value of the bit expresses whether the object is in a knapsack
 aisi prayek abhivyakti maanya nahin hoti he, kyonki object kaa aakaar nepsek kii kshamta se adhik ho ekta he
 The fitness of the solution is equal to the sum of the values of all objects in the knapsack if the expression is valid or 0 otherwise
 kuch samasyaon main, fitness ke vyanjak ko paribhaashit karnaa yaa to mushkil hota he yaa phir asambhav hota he; in maamalon main, interective anuvanshik elgorithm kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Once we define the genetic expression and fitness function, GA proceeds to initialize the population of the solution, then improve it through mutation, crossover, reversal, and selection operators
 prarambh main ek praarambhik aabaadi ke nirmaan ke liye kai vyaktigat samaadhaan yadrichhik rup se utpann kiye jate hai
 The size of the population depends on the nature of the problem, but typically consists of several hundreds of thousands of possible solutions

 kabhi kabhi, samaadhaan un kshetron main "shuru kiye" ja sakate hai jahaan anukultam samaadhaan milane kii sambhaavna hoti he
 During each next generation, a proportion of the existing population is selected for breeding a new generation
 ek fitness aadhaarit prakriya ke madhyam se vyaktigat samaadhaanon kaa chayan kiya jaataa he, jahaan praroopik rup se adhik feet samaadhaan ke chune jane kii adhik sambhaavna hoti he
 Specific selection methods determine the fitness of each solution and prioritize the choice of the best solution
 anya vidhiyaan aabaadi ke keval ek yadrichhik namoonay ko nirdhaarit karti hai, kyonki is prakriya main bahut adhik samay lag saktaa he
 Most functions are stochastic and are designed such that a small proportion of low fit solutions are selected
 This helps to widen the population diversity, preventing premature convergence on bad solutions
 lokapriy or acchhee prakaar se chayan kii gayi vidhiyon main shaamil hai rolet wheel chayan or toornament chayan
 The next step is to generate a second-generation population of the solution selected through the genetic operator: also called crossover) and / or mutation

 In real-world problems such as structural optimization problems, a single function evaluation may require several hours to several days of full simulation

 In this case, it may be necessary to skip an accurate evaluation and use an approximation fitness that is computationally effective

 This means that it does not know how to sacrifice short-term fitness to achieve long-term fitness
 The probability of this event depends on the size of the fitness landscape: specific problems provide an easy climb to a global compatibility, others make it easier for the function to discover local compatibility

 a common technique to maintain diversity is to impose a "bottom penalty", in which, a sufficient degree of) extra penalty is incurred in a group of individuals, which will reduce the expression of that group in subsequent generations, thereby increasing the population Other people can be retained
 This wager, however, may not be effective depending on the scenario of the problem

 Some argue that crossover is the most important, whereas mutation is only necessary to ensure that probable solutions are not lost
