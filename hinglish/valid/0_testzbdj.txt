 We can estimate this only by accounting of income and expenditure and standard of living can be expressed only in comparative terms, such as high standard of living or low standard of living

 India's national income is very low in the proportion of western countries, so the standard of living in India is considered low

 saral shabdon main, yah 1 volt tathaa 1 electranik aavesh ke gunanfal ke baraabar hoti he, jahaan ek volt = ek jul prati culumb he
 
 ek electron volt ati laghu maatra kii urja he: According to Albert Einstein, energy is equivalent to weight, as also expressed in the famous load-energy-equivalence formula: e = mc2
 Therefore, it is common for physical particles, where अ and energy are often interchangeable, using ev / c2 or simple ev for units of load

 This made the struggle for environment and development for the first time a topic of discussion at the national level in which not only the displaced people but also scientists, ngos and general public participated
 narmada nadi par sardaar sarovar baandh pariyojna kaa udghaatan 1961 main pandit jawahar laal nehru ne kiya tha
 But no consensus could be reached on a suitable water distribution policy between the three states - Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 1969 main, sarkaar ne narmada jal vivaad nyaaydhikaran kaa gathan kiya taaki jal sambandhi vivaad kaa hal karke pariyojna kaa kaary shuru kiya ja sake
 In 1979, the tribunal reached consensus and the Narmada Valley Project was born which included construction of two huge dams on the Narmada River and its 4134 rivers - Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat and Narmada Sagar Dam in Madhya Pradesh, 28 medium dams and 3000 water projects
 1985 main is pariyojna ke liye vishwa bank ne 450 karod dollar kaa lone dene kii ghoshnaa kii sarkaar ke anusaar is pariyojna se madhya pradesh, gujarat tathaa rajasthan ke sookhaa grast kshetron kii 2
27 karod hectare bhoomi ko sinchai ke liye jal milegaa, bijli kaa nirmaan hoga, pine ke liye jal milegaa tathaa kshetra main baadh ko roka ja sakegaa
 The Narmada project has given rise to a serious controversy
 ek ore is pariyojna ko samruddhi tathaa vikaas kaa suchak mana ja rahaa he jiske parinaam swaroop sinchai, peyajal kii aapurti, baadh par niyantran, rojgaar ke naye avasar, bijli tathaa sookhe se bachaav aadi laabhon ko praapt karne kii baat kii ja rahi he vahiin duusari ore anumaan he ki isse teen rajyon kii 37000 hectare bhoomi jalmagn ho jaaegi jisamen 13000 hectare van bhoomi he
 It is also estimated that this will displace more than one lakh people of 248 villages
 jinamein 58 pratishat log adivasee kshetra ke hai
 Opposition to this project has now taken the form of a mass movement
 1980- 87 ke dauraan jan jatiyon ke adhikaron kii samarthak gaiyr sarkari sanstha ank vaahni ke netaa anil patel ne janajatiy logon ke punarvaas ke adhikaron ko lekar hai court va sarvocch nyaayalay main ladaai ladi
 The Gujarat government announced a rehabilitation policy in December 1987 as a result of Supreme Court orders

 Initially, the movement was aimed at stopping the dam by damaging the environment and displacement of people from it
 baad main andolan kaa uddeshy baandh ke kaaran visthapit logon ko sarkaar dwaara di ja rahi raahat kaaryon kii dekh-rekh tathaa unke adhikaron ke liye nyaayalay main janaa ban gaya
 The movement also demands that the people whose land is being acquired should have the right to participate in the scheme, they should not only have the right to fair payment for themselves but also participate in the benefits of the project
 is prakriya main narmada bachaao andolan ne vartmaan vikaas ke model par prashanchinh lagaaya he
 The Narmada Bachao Andolan which emerged as a mass movement formed an organized group of many social workers, environmentalists, students, women, tribals, farmers and human rights activists

 Apart from Medha Patkar, its main activists include Anil Patel, Arunadhati Roy, Baba Amte, etc
, conferred with the Booker honor
 narmada bachaaon andolan ne 1989 main ek nayaa mode liya
 In September 1989, a general meeting was held at Harsud place of Madhya Pradesh in which 45000 people from more than 200 ngos participated
 bharat main pehali baar ‘narmada’ kaa prashn ab ek rashtriya mudda ban gaya
 This was the biggest rally ever on the issue of environment, in which all the big non-governmental organizations and social workers engaged in protecting the rights of the common man participated
 harasood sammelan ne na keval baandh kaa virodh kiya balki ise ‘vinaashkari vikaas’ kaa naam bhi diya
 The whole world watched this environmental event very carefully
 disambar, 1990 main narmada bachaao andolan dwaara ek ‘sangharsh yatra’ bhi nikaali gai
 The pedestrians hoped that they would be able to pressurize the government for a comprehensive reconsideration of the Sardar Sarovar Dam project
 lagbhag 6000 logon ne rajghat se madhya pradesh, gujarat tak padayatra kii
 It also saw positive results
 jan bhaawanaaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vishwa bank ne 1991 main baandh kii samiksha ke liye ek nishpaksh ayog kaa gathan kiya
 This commission said that the work of the project is not being done according to the policies of the World Bank and the Government of India
 is prakaar vishwa bank ne is pariyojna se 1994 main apane haath khinch liye
 4 haalanki rajya sarkaar ne pariyojna jari rakhane kaa nirnay liya
 On this, Medha Patkar's 1993 hunger strike was put in place whose main purpose was to stop the displacement of people from the dam construction site
 andolankartaaon ne jab dekha ki namarda niyantran nigam tathaa rajya sarkaar dwaara 1987 main paryaavaran tathaa van mantralay dwaara diye gaye dishanirdeshon ko nahin lagu kiya ja rahaa he to 1994 main narmada bachaao andolan ne sarvocch nyaayalay main ek yachika darj kii tathaa nyaaypalika se cese ke niptaare tak baandh ke nirmaan kaary ko rokane kii guzarish kii
 In early 1995, the Supreme Court ordered that the government stop the remaining work of the dam until the rehabilitation of the displaced people is done
 18 aktubar, 2000 ko sarvocch nyaayalay ne baandh ke kaary ko phir shuru karne tathaa isaki uchai 90 meter tak badhaane kii manjuuri de di
 It said that the height can go up to 90 meters and then to 138 meters, but for this, step by step it is necessary to ensure that the environment is not threatened and the work of resettling people is going on properly, as well as the judiciary New guidelines were given for the rehabilitation of displaced people according to which a primary school, a panchayat house, a hospital, water and 500 people for the resettled people at the new place Power system and must have a religious site
 april 2006 main narmada bachaao andolan main ek baar phir se ugrata ai kyonki baandh kii unchaai 110 meter se badhaakar 122 meter tak le jane kaa nirnay liya gaya
 Megha Patkar, who was struggling to demand the rehabilitation of the already displaced people, sat on hunger strike

 a sensor is an instrument that performs the task of measuring a physical amount and converts it into a signal that can be read by an observer or instrument
 udhaahranswaroop, ek paare se bharaa kaanch kaa tharmametre maapit taapmaana ko ek taral padaarth ke vistaar tathaa sankuchan main parivartit kar detaa he jise ek anshaankit kaanch kii nalee par padhaa ja saktaa he
 a thermocouple converts the temperature into an output voltage that can be read by a voltmeter
 sateekta kii drushti se, sabhi sensoron ko gyaat maanakon ke anuroop anshaankit karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Sensors are used in everyday objects
 jaise - sparsh-samvedansheel lift ke batan or lamp jiske aadhaar-tal ko chune se yah mand yaa tej ho jaataa he
 There are countless applications of these sensors about which most people are not yet aware
 in anuprayogon main gaadiyaan, mashin, antariksh praudyogiki, dawa, vinirmaan or robotics shaamil hai
 The sensitivity of a sensor indicates how often the sensor's output changes when the measured amount changes
 udhaahranswaroop, yadi taapmaana main 1 °C ke parivartan ke falswaroop tharmametre kaa paara 1 cm dravit hota he, to isaki samvedansheeltaa 1 cm / °C hoti he
 Sensors that measure very small changes must have very high sensitivity
 sensor un par bhi prabhaav daalate hai jin par ye maapne kaa kaary karte hai; udhaahranswaroop, kamare ke taapmaana ko maapne ke liye upyog kiye jane vaale ek tharmametre ko ek garm taral padaarth se bhare ek cap main daalane par vah taral padaarth thanda ho jaataa he jabaki us taral padaarth se tharmametre garm ho jaataa he
 The design of the sensors should be such that they have less impact on which the measuring work is done
 sensor ke chota hone se isamen praayah sudhaar hota he or isse anya laabh bhi praapt ho sakate hai
 Technological Advancement MEMS technology as a microsensor used determines the production of more and more sensors at the microscopic level
 adhikansh maamalon main, dirghadarsheey drushtikonon kii tulana main ek microcensor mahatvapurn dhang se ucchtar gati tathaa samvedansheeltaa par pahunch jaataa he
 a good sensor follows the following rules: adarsh sensoron kii banaavat raikhik hoti hai
 The output signal of any such sensor is linearly proportional to the value of the measured property characteristic
 samvedansheeltaa ko tab output sanket or maapit gundharm visheshta ke anupaat ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 For example, if a sensor does a temperature measurement and has a voltage output, then sensitivity is a constant whose unit is; This sensor is linear because the ratio is constant at all measurement points
 yadi sensor adarsh nahin he to kai prakaar ke vyatikram dekhe ja sakate hai: All these inversions can be classified as methodological errors or random errors
 paddatibaddh trutiyon kii kshatipurti kabhi-kabhi kuch prakaar ke anshankan niti ke madhyam se kii ja sakati he
 Noise is an random error, such as filtration, that can be reduced by the signal process, usually at the expense of dynamic activity of the sensor
 kisi sensor kaa vibhedan vah laghuttam parivartan he jise yah maapi ja rahi raashi main se khoj nikaalata he
 Often the lowest significant digit in a numerical display will fluctuate, indicating that only a change of that magnitude has differentiated
 vibhedan yatharthata se sambandhit he jisase maapan kaa kaary kiya jaataa he
 For example, a scanning tunneling probe can differentiate between atoms and molecules
 sabhi jivit jeevadhariyon main jaivik sensor paae jate hai jinke karyanvayan varnit yantric upkarnon ke samaan hi hote hai
 Most of these are specialized cells that are sensitive to: jaivik samvedansheel avyav kaa upyog karke jaivik sensoron kii nakal karne vaale kritrim sensoron ko jaev-sensor kaha jaataa he

 There are many assumptions regarding the original origin of the word Osho

 There has been a need for large investment in research and development, due to which the expenditure of the merchant has also increased
 praudyogiki jatilta paidaa karata he or jivan ko kathin banaata he
 Due to technology, many things are produced very quickly
 praudyogiki sthiti matbhed banaaya or saamaajik matbhed ko hataa diya gaya he
 Technology has become a new trend in communication and other aspects of life
 praudyogiki utpaadakta vruddhi main yogadan diya ha
 Technology has changed production methods
 yah kushal shram kii aavashyaktaa bad gai he or utpaadan kaa samay kam ho gaya he
 However the cost of production of these organizations has increased

 Nowadays, students use mobile devices etc
 through which they can do many tasks

 Because of this, the need of teachers in the school is becoming less as videos and other mediums are being used in classrooms
 aaj kal koi bhi vyakti kahi bhi baithkar padh saktaa he yadi uske paas ek computer or internet conection ho
 Technology can affect some teachers
 praudyogiki ke chaatro laabh kyon Technology can enable students to develop skills that will be necessary in the future
 kaksha main praudyogiki ke safal pratyaropan ke saath, chaatro ve se laabh hoga ki ek aadhunik or vyapak shiksha praapt karne main sakasham hai
 Their education is growing within their generation and our society will be more favorable for that direction

 Despite the advent of many modern methods of pricing and portfolio selection and arbitrage empirical flaws, CAPM is still more prevalent due to its generality and usefulness in a wide variety of circumstances
 siepiem kisi akeli parisampatti athwa parisampattiyon ke samooh kii keemat nirdhaaran karne ke liye ek model he
 For a single security, we use the securities market line and its relationship with expected return and systemic risk to determine how much the price of a single market will be determined by the market compared to its risk category
 pratibhuti bazaar rekha se kisi ek sampatti kii puure bazaar kii tulana main pratifal-jokhim anupaat kii gananaa bhi kii ja sakati he
 Hence, as the expected return of an asset will decrease by its beta coefficient, the return-risk ratio of this single asset will be equal to the return-risk ratio of the entire market
 is prakaar: The market-to-risk ratio is effectively the market risk premium / premium and by re-employing the above equation and assuming E, we get the capital asset pricing model
 jahaan: If this is rewritten from the risk premium point of view, we find that: arthath kisi parisampatti kaa "apana jokhim premium"- "bazaar jokhim premium" va "beta" kaa gunanfal he
 Note 1: The expected market returns are often estimated by taking a geometric average of the value of historical returns in a market-portfolio

 This is important for investors who do not have an advanced-diversified portfolio
 sameekaran parmparik siepiem sameekaran ke samaan hi he “jisamen bazaar jokhim adhivetan ko beta utpaa or bazaar jokhim adhivetan ke guna se pratisthapit kar diya gaya he:”:5 "where: pratibhuti bazaar rekha siepiem ke formula kaa graph ke rup main chithran karti he
 show the risk on the x axis and the expected return on the y axis
 bazaar jokhim kaa anumaan pratibhuti bazaar rekha kii dhalaan se lagaaya jaataa he
 The relationship between β and expected return is depicted on the securities market line, which represents the expected return as a function of β
 The intercept is the bazaar main uplabdh nominal jokhim mukt dar he, jabaki dhalaan market premium he, E− Rf
 It can be said that the securities market line represents as a single-factor model of the asset price, while β shows how likely it is to be affected by market changes, thus the SML equation is : aisi paristhitiyon ke liye yah ek ati mahatvapurn tul he jab pataa karnaa ho ki kya koi parisampatti / pratibhuti jokhim kii tulana main ek sweekaarya pratifal degi ki nahin
 Solitary assets are depicted on the securities market line graph
 yadi jokhim va pratifal kaa paraspar chithran rekha se upar hota he to iskaa arth he ki yah pratibhuti sasti mil rahi he or is par adhik laabh kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 If it falls below the illustration line, then the price should be considered expensive and it will not get as much profit as the risk is being taken

 For this we will need to calculate an independent estimate of the return on assets, which is usually done by fundamental or technical analysis, proportional analysis, etc
 siepiem ke anusaar, yadi anumaanit mulya, sampatti ke siepiem dwaara sujhai dar ke saath samyojit kiye gaye bhavishya nakadapravaah ke baraabar he - to sampatti sahi mulya par mil rahi he
 If the estimated value is higher than the CAPM valuation, the property is cheaper
 kisi parisampatti kaa pratibhuti bazaar rekha par sthit nahin hona uske mulya main visangati ko darshata he
 Since the expected return of the property at timepoint t { \ displaystyle t} is e = e - p t p t { \ displaystyle e = { \ frac {E-P_ {t}} {P_ {t xxrep 5 } as suggested by the CAPM If the return exceeds, it means that p t { \ displaystyle P_ {t}} is too low, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t + 1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 siepiem kaa prayog karne par parisampatti kaa mulya p 0 { \ displaystyle P_{0}}, nimna leniyar sambandh se pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he: Where PT { \ displaystyle P_ {T}} is the payoff of the asset or portfolio
 siepiem dwaara pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi vishisht sampatti ke tulanaatmak jokhim ko dhyaan main rakhte hue uski apekshit vaapasi arthath samaayojan dar, kitni honi chahie
 If the value of beta is more than one, it means - above average risk; Less than one means - below average risk
 is prakaar, kisi zyada jokhim vaale stock kaa beta adhik hoga or unhen adhik dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 Whereas less sensitive stocks will have lower beta and will be adjusted at a lower rate
 yah prachlit anaupchaarik dharna, ki adhik jokhim lene vaale niveshak adhik pratifal kii ichha rakhte hai, ke anuroop hi he
 Because beta is the measure of the vulnerability of a single asset to full market risk, it is clear from the definition that beta will be a measure of market risk: 1
 bazaar jokhim maapne ke liye ek poorak paimaane ke rup main stock market index kaa prayog bahutayat main kiya jaataa he, atah inkaa beta maap 1 hota he
 Thus, investors of a large and well-defined portfolio can expect results from their investments according to market movements

 Systematic or market risk is due to the factors that affect all investment options, ie the entire market
 is prakaar ke jokhim par niyantran karnaa kathin he
 Disorganized risk is the risk that affects a particular security or investment option
 nivesh kaa vishaakhan karke aise jokhim ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context — ie its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness — as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance ie less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 siepiem maanata he ki kisi nivesh ke jokhim-pratifal anupaat ko durust kiya ja saktaa he, ek adarsh portpholio vah hoga jo ki ek nirdhaarit pratifal dar ke liye nunatam jokhim ke saath ho
 Additionally, as each new asset added to the portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above
 All such optimal portfolios, ie, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 An investor can also invest some part of his fund in risky assets and save some cash, which can be earned at a risk-free rate
 
 Here the ratio of risky and risk free does not determine the overall return - this relationship is definitely linear
 is prakaar se yah sambhav he ki nimna don main se kisi ek prakaar ek nishchit return praapt kiya ja saktaa he : However for a fixed return, only one of the above options would prove to be efficient
 chunki jokhimamukt sampatti paribhaashatah kisi bhi anya sampatti se correlated nahin he, dwitiya vikalp main saamanytah kam vichlan hoga jiske kaaran yah donon main se adhik kushal hoga
 This relationship would also hold true for other portfolios on the effective range: some cash with a higher return - is more efficient - rather than just a portfolio with lower returns at the same return rate
 ek nishchit jokhimamukt dar ke liye, ek hi kushal portpholio hoga jise ki nakadi ke saath milakar kisi bhi pratilabh ke liye nunatam jokhim kii sthiti praapt kii ja sakati he

 jahari talli-u0va0-1, yamakeshwar tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke paudi jile kaa ek gaanv he
 It was the day of 16 August 1781
 achaanak puri kaashi nagari main bijli kii bhaanti yah khabar fail gai ki east india company ke angrej afasar warren hestings ne kaashi naresh maharaj chet singh ko unke shivala sthit rajmahal main bandi bana liya he
 The reason was the bribing of Hastings
 yah angrej un dinon donon haathon se bhartiya nareshon se rishwat vasuulne ke liye badnaam tha
 It wanted Maharaj Chet Singh to recover Rs 50 lakh in fine in the form of false accusations, which he refused to give, so Hastings came to Kashi on 14 August along with the 4 Company Army and made a halt there in the garden of Madhodas Satiya, Gola Dinanath Was adjacent to
 use kalkatte se nadi ke raste kaashi aane main ek maheene se adhik samay laga
 He left Calcutta on 5 July
 16 agast ko usne chet singh ko bandi bana liya
 At the same time, Kashiwasi Pralayankar was such a devotee of Lord Vishveshwar Vishwanath who knew how to teach beef eaters a lesson to the British
 hajaaron kashivasiyon ne jo bhi hathiyaar haath laga vah lekar warren hestings or uski sena kii gheraabandi kar lee
 The British were inattentive and proud
 kaashi kii janata ne lagaataar 4 din tak angrejon se bheeshan yuddh kiya, jisamen saikadon angrej kaat daale gaye
 Hastings's senses flew away and he was brought to life
 tab usne kot-pint-top dur phenkakar stri vesh pahana or janaani sawari kii tarah ek pardedaar palki main ja baitha
 Those who carried that palanquin were told that "bibi is going to see Vindhyachal for Devi-darshan
 " is tarah chhalpurvak janaane vesh main hestings chunaar aayaa or vahaan se pun: jal maarg se hi kalakatta kooch kar gaya
 The British, including Chet Singh Kashi's force, prevailed and the people freed him from the palace of Shivala
 tabhi se us aitihaasik vijay kii smriti main kashivasi ye panktiyaan kehane lage- "hoda on horse, jean on elephant, kaashi se bhaaga, warren hestin
 
 " That is, the frightened Warren Hastings got so nervous while running away from Kashi that he kept the elephant's horse on the horse and the horse's genes were tightened on the elephant and escaped from Kashi
 warren hestigan or kaashi kii veerta The horse on the horse and the elephant on the gene / Sneak ran Warren Hastening
 This saying is still popular among the old people in the streets of Banaras
 iske peeche ek kahani he
 It is said that about two hundred and thirty years ago, Kashi was compared to the princely states of the country
 bhugolic drushtikon se kaashi rajya bharat kaa hryday pradesh tha
 In view of that, it was raised in the British Parliament in those days that if the Kashi state comes to the British rule, their economy and business will be greatly developed
 is vichaar vimarsh ke baad tatkaaleen governor general warren hesting ko bharat par adhikaar karne ke liyabheja gaya
 In order to rule the kingdom of Kashi, the British demanded the oil of the head of the then Kashi King for two and a half ser cheeti or a hefty amount instead
 angrejon dwaara bharat ko gulam banane qi manshaa ko kaashi naresh raja chetsingh ne pehle hi bhaanp liya tha
 Therefore, he refused to give even the amount, but he felt that the British could invade his kingdom, keeping this in view, Kashi Naresh had approached some big princely states like Maratha, Peshwa and Gwalior and signed a treaty
 That if needed, we will try our best to drive these Firangi out of India
 14 agast 1781, din shanivaar, general warren hesting ek bade sainik jatthe ke saath ganga ke jalmaarg se kaashi pahunchaa
 He made Madhav Das Ka Bagh of Kabirchaura his hideout
 kehete hai ki raja chetsingh ke darbar se nishkashit ousaan singh naam ke ek karmchaaree kalakatta ja kar warren hesting se mila or uskaa vishwaasapaatr ban baitha, jise angrejon ne "raja" qi oopaadhi se bhi nawaja tha
 After reaching the Kashi, the British plotted to arrest the King Naresh Rajachet Singh
 Day Sunday, August 15, 1781, in the morning, Warren Hasting sent a letter to one of his English officers, Markham, to fetch two and a half kilograms of head oil from Raja Chet Singh or to fetch a hefty amount instead
 In that letter, Hastings accused Raja Chet Singh of misusing the state power and conspiracy
 patr ke uttar main raja sahab ne shadyantr ke prati apni anbhigyata prakat qi
 us din yani 15 agast ko raja chetsingh or warren hesting ke bich din bhar patr vyavhaar chalata rahaa On the second day, August 16, the last Monday of Sawan, like every year, King Chet Singh came to Shivalaghat, the small fort across the Ganges, to pray to Lord Shankar instead of his Ramnagar Fort
 isi kile main unki tehsil kaa chota sa karyaalay bhi tha
 It is said that when the King of Kashi retired from Shivpujan and was watching the work in his court, at the same time Governor Warren Hasting's army started trying to enter his court, but Kashi's soldiers did not let his nefarious plans succeed
 
 tab ek angrej resident ne raja sahab se milane qi ichha jaahir qi or kahalwaya ki wo governor sahab kaa ek jaruri sandesh le kar aayaa he, lekin sainikon ne ye andeh prakat kiya ki wo itani sena saath kyon laayaa he? iske jawaab main resident ne ye kahkar nai chaal chali ki sena to vaise hi uske saath chali ai he, kile main keval ham do-teen adhikari hi aaenge
 is par raja sahab ke aadesh par unhen andar kile main bhej diya gaya
 In the meanwhile, swords were drawn from both sides, during this time, an English officer aimed a gun at Raja Chet Singh, till his finger pressed on the trigger of the gun that before him the same Mahshur goon of Kashi, Babu Nanhku Singh, had the same sword
 The English officer's head was severely cut and hit the ground, blood splattered all around, seeing that the blood-soaked British officer screamed backwards
 Town fled
 On the other hand, the brave Ranbankur of Vigilant Kashi, hidden around the outside of the fort, understood that there was a fight in the fort inside
 phir kya tha sabhi baj qi tarah gori chamadi waalon par tut pade, lekin kis ne kis ko maaraa ye to aaj tak pataa nahin chal sakaa, lekin shivala ghat par bane kile ke baahar lage shilapatt par angrejon ne ye zarur ankit karvaa diya ki isi jagah par teen angrej adhikariyon leftinent stoker, leftinent scot or leftinent george semlas samet lagbhag do sau sainik maare gaye the
 Soon after the incident, King Kashi King's minister Babu Maniyar Singh advised Raja Saheb to arrest Governor Warren Hastings, but his Diwan Bakshi Sadanand refused to let him do so
 udhar warren hesting apane pakde jane ke dar se "madhav das baag" ke maalik pandit benny ram se chunaar jane ke liye sahaayta maangi
 isi bich use pataa chal gaya ki raja sahab qi ek badi fouj use giraftaar karne isi taraf aa rahi he
 It is said that fearing his arrest, Warren Hasting jumped into a well inside the same Madhav Das Bagh and when it was night, he disguised himself as a woman and traveled towards Chunar
 raja chetsingh ke dewan bakshi sadanand qi ye salaah ki warren hesting ko giraftaar naa kiya jaay, bharat ke liye durbhagyapurna rahaa
 If Warren Hastings had been arrested at the hands of the King of Kashi on that day, then the British might not have been able to get their feet in India
 maje qi baat to ye he ki angrej itihaaskaaron ne kaashi naresh raja chetsingh ko bhagoda sabit kiya he or vahiin duusari taraf shivala ghat par jo shilapatt lagavaaya us main saaf-saaf shabdon main likhvaya ki "isi jagah unke teen adhikariyon sahit do sau sainik maare gaye the
 Which can be seen even today, but he remained silent on the fact that Warren Hastings was a fugitive
 agar is ghatana par vichaar karen to swatantraaa aandolan kaa pehla bigul kaashi main hi baja tha, lekin durbhaagya ye he ki us ghatana qi yaad main aaj tak yahan par koi smarak nahin ban sakaa he
 Yes, on this day i

 August 16, the families of the ancestors who sacrificed themselves on that day for freedom, definitely light a "lamp" in their memory

 Fuco is counted among the foremost thinkers of the 20th century
 yah phuko ke lekhon kaa hi prabhaav tha ki aadhunik vigyaan ke bahut se kshetron main or khaskar itihaas lekhan ke kshetra main krantikari parivartan huye
 The most recent and thought-provoking development in this understanding has been done by Michel Fuco - how the state's institution makes people listen to it
 poonjipati varg rajya main apni saamaajik satta keval hinsa ke upkarnon ke dwaara hi sthapit nahin karata
 He also ensures continuity of his social power by using a variety of cultural forms
 isliye rajya kii sanrachanaon ko unke saanskrithik roopon main samajhnaa bhi aavashyak he
 Ultimately, these cultural structures bear the responsibility of creating consensus in favor of the state
 phuko bataate hai ki aadhunik samaaj main logon ko niyantrit yaa anushaasit karne ke liye nigaraanee kii ek bahustareey vyavastha ke alaava dusron dwaara kiye gayi nirnyon ko aatmsaat karne tathaa pariksha pranali jaise upaay apanaaye jate hai
 Fuko insists that just keeping an eye on the people completes half the power
 iske liye ve stadium kii vyavastha kaa hawala dete hai jisamen siton kii vyavastha is tarah kii jaati he ki darshak kisi kaarykram ko aasaani se dekh paayen par saath hi yah vyavastha satta ke niyantrakon ko darshakon par nigaah rakhane kii sahuuliyat bhi pradaan karti he
 Fuco also mentions the prison punopticon conceived by political thinker Jeremy Bentham to mark the model of power of discipline and control
 jisaki mul vaastu-yojana kuch aisi thi ki kothriyon main band kaidi ek duusare ke liye to adrishy rahen lekin jail ke kendriya tower kii nigaraanee se baahar na ho paayen
 Prisoners never get to know whether they are being monitored or not, but there is a thought in their minds that someone keeps an eye on them
 phuko panoptican ke siddhant ko ek aise roopak kii tarah dekhte hai jo jail kii chauhaddi ke paar jaakar skulon, kaarkaanon or aspataalon main anushaasan kaa aam dharra ban jaataa he
 Although this proposed prison of Bantham was never able to materialize, but as a theory, it has occupied almost every activity of modern society
 aadhunik samaaj main anushaasan kaayam karne vaali vyavasthaaon ke liye vah ek aisa aujaar siddh hui he jisane praaq-aadhunik kaal ke raajaaon or hakimon ko apdasth kar unki jagah khud ko sthapit kar liya he
 In this sequence, Fuko also shows that the system governing modern power or discipline does not only monitor the activities of the people but also controls the people by showing their incompetence
 unke anusaar aadhunik satta samaj, pratibha, saamaanya or asaamaanya vyavhaar jaisi kotiyon kaa nirmaan karti he or jab koi vyakti iske dwaara sthapit kasautiyon yaa maanakon par karaa nahin utarataa to vyavastha aise vyakti ko kamatar yaa asaamaanya ghoshit karne kaa mauka nahin chookti
 In this context, Fuku does not forget to remind that this attitude of these disciplinary institutions of modern society is not driven by any kind of vengeance but by reform
 jiskaa antim lakshya yah hota he ki vyakti samaaj kii pradutt kasautiyon yaa maanakon ko sweekaar kar le
 Note that this method of discipline by the beliefs of the society is quite different from that system of judicial punishment in which a person was punished only on the basis of whether his act is lawful or not
 aise kisi faisale main yah nahin kaha jaataa tha ki vyakti saamaanya he yaa asaamaanya
 But modern society insists on setting certain standards in the matters of educational programs, medical practices and industry and products, and the dominance of these standards is so all-round that the behavior and personality of the individual starts to change accordingly
 saamanytah rajya ko shashan, sanghathan yaa raajnneetik samudaay ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 It is believed that its various forms have existed in every phase of history
 isamen hone vaale badlaav itihaas ke pramukh vishay rahe hai
 Only primitive nomadic political communities are not given the status of the state
 mana jaataa he ki in samudaayon main is avadharana ke saath- saath usase judi sunishchit vyavastha kaa abhaav hota he
 In fact, to be a state, it is necessary that there is a permanent relationship between the community and the territory
 is saamaanya tareeke se upyog kiye jane par yah shabd is vichaar ko abhivyakt karata he ki raajnneetik samudaay kii kuch aisi nishchit saarvbhaumik visheshtaayen hoti hai, jo samay or sthaan se pare hoti hai; arthath greek polis, madhyayugin regnum or aadhunik ganatantron ke bich kuch saamaanya visheshta hai
 Can this property or feature be defined more narrowly? yah baat to spasht he ki yadi rajya kii koi paribhaasha ise shaashvat or aparivartansheel vastu yaa sanghathan ke rup main pesh karti he, to aisa karke vah itihaas main badlaav or vikaas kii prakriya kii upeksha karti he
 Therefore a valid definition should focus on other aspects and functions
 itihaas yah dikhaata he ki ek saarvbhaumik parighatna ke rup main rajya ek aisi gatividhi yaa sanghathan he, jo manushya par aavashyaktaaon ke rup main thopi gayi he
 Some of its main features as an activity of this kind are as follows: It creates a definite connection between humans and their possessions; Or in other words it creates unity or society among humans
 isliye rajya kaa astitv vishisht taur par ek buniyadi chiz he
 Second, it accepts the connection between humans with the power of order, or a form of rule or command and obedience
 teesraa, rajya ko banane or kaayam rakhane vaali gatividhi vishisht hoti he, jo hameshaa khud ko un logon ke kilaaf pesh karti he, jo is samudaay kaa bhaag nahin hote hai
 However, despite seeing the state as a historical phenomenon, it cannot be denied that a philosophical aspect has always been involved in the writing on it
 iske tahat prashn uthta he ki rajya jis tarah kii vyavastha yaa logon ke bich sambandh sthapit karnaa chahta he, uskaa adarsh rup kya he? kya vah adarsh rup hasil kar liya gaya he? kya shashan kaa vartmaan tarika sahi he? kya samudaay ke bahari sambandhon ko sahi tareeke se sanchalit kiya ja rahaa he? asal main, is najariye se vichaar karne par rajya sirf manushyon par thopi gayi aavashyaktaa ke rup main hi saamne nahin aata he, balki yah manushyon ke saamne ‘sahi’ ke chunaav kii samasya ke rup main bhi saamne aata he
 There is no struggle to establish a system instead of just anarchy in the state
 isaki bajaay, yah ek aisi vyavastha sthapit karne kaa bhi sangharsh he, jo sachhee, pramanik or nyaaypurna ho
 Therefore, the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Hegel etc
 can be seen as an attempt to find a philosophical answer to the question of what the kingdom should be like
 in vidwaanon ne rajya or duusare tarah ke maanav- sanghathanon ke bich antar karne kii koshish kii he or iske saath hi inhone apane adarsh rajya kii pariklpana or uske paksh main tark bhi prastut kiye hai
 There is also a need to connect the idea of the state as a universal historical phenomenon and the idea of the state as a philosophical concept, especially the modern phenomenon
 aise bahut se itihaaskaar or raajnneetik sidghantkaar hai, jo yah tark dete hai ki ‘rajya’ shabd kaa upyog europe main punarjagran or dharm-sudhaar ke baad saamne aayi vyavastha ke liye kiya janaa chahie
 They believe that the principle of the state is in fact linked to this specific phenomenon
 isliye yadi iskaa prayog itihaas ke duusare daur main maujuud sanghathanon ke liye kiya jaataa he, to isse iske arth ke bare main bhram badhegaa
 The term state as an organized system also arose between the end of the fourteenth century and the seventeenth century
 rajya kaa angrezi shabd ‘state’ latin shabd ‘stair’ se niklaa he, jiskaa arth he khadaa hona
 In this way it tells about a situation
 rajya ko ek aadhunik avadharana maanane ke peeche ek mukhya vichaar yah bhi he ki aadhunik rajya kaa ubhaar prabhusatta kii avadharana ke saath hua
 It is a clear modern belief that a state which is not sovereign, is not a state in the true sense
 prabhusatta kaa arth yah he ki rajya apane adhikaar main aane vaale bhu-kshetra main raajnneetik praadhikaar kaa sarvocch strot he
 Sovereignty has two aspects - the internal aspect and the external aspect
 aantarik pahalu kaa arth he ki rajya kii simaaon ke bheetar rajya se unchaa koi bhi praadhikari nahin he
 The state is supreme and the citizen cannot appeal against any other authority against the state
 bahari prabhusatta kaa arth he— kisi vishisht rajya ko duusare rajyon dwaara di jane vaali manyata
 Also, it also accepts that a state can speak on behalf of its citizens in international affairs
 yah adhikaar antarrashtriya daayre main rajya kii swaittata or prabhusatta ko vyakt karata he
 To consider the state as a modern phenomenon does not mean that it should also be dismissed as a historical entity or a philosophical idea
 yah bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki aadhunik rajya kii koi bhi visheshta itihaas ke pehle ke daur main maujuud nahin thi
 In fact, many of the characteristics of the earlier 'states' of the modern era and the 'states' encountered with the modern era are similar
 isi tarah, yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki ek darshanik vichaar ke rup main rajya aadhunik rajya kii ‘purna avadharana’ kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 In fact, philosophically, the concept of the state has been conceived and discussed in different ways
 masalan, udaarataavaadiyon ne rajyon ko ek ‘tatasth’ sanstha ke rup main dekha, lekin rajya kii bhoomika ke bare main udaarataavaad ke bheetar gambheer or vividh charchaa hoti rahi he
 Even within Marxism, there is a rich tradition of debate over the state
 isamen rajya ko poonjipati virgon kaa saadhan maanane ke saath hi ‘rajya kii saapekshik swaittata’ se judaa vaad-vivaad bhi shaamil rahaa he
 Anarchists have considered the state as an unnatural power and advocated its complete abolition
 marks-angels ke lekhan main bhi ek aisi samyavaadee sthiti kii kalpana kii gayi he, jisamen rajya puri tarah khatm ho jaayegaa
 But instead of waiting for such a situation, anarchists want to end the state as soon as possible
 inkaa maananaa he ki rajya manushya kii swaabhaavik prakruti ke kilaaf hinsa par aadhaarit he
 On the other hand, conservatives favor the state so that it can preserve the traditions and values accumulated over many generations
 nariwadiyon ke bheetar kii vibhinn dhaaraon main rajya ke bare main alag-alag tarah se vichaar kiya gaya he
 For example, liberal-feminism holds that the state as an institution is inclined towards male supremacy, but this trend of the state can be improved by making laws and using it to establish male-female equality
 can be done
 duusari ore, samaajawaadee-nariwad rajya ke poonjeewaadi charitra ko mahilaon kii samasya kaa mukhya kaaran maanata he
 It is believed that only the end of capitalist state can improve the condition of women
 teesraa, radical nariwadi vichaar ke mutabik rajya pitrusatta par aadhaarit parivaar or uske dwaara aage badhaaye jane vaale mulyon kii hifaazat kaa kaam karata he
 Therefore, to completely eliminate patriarchy, it is necessary to abolish the state
 spasht taur par, rajya, isaki prakruti or bhoomika ke bare main bahut vividh or gahan vaad-vivaad he
 In recent times, it has been argued that the state is slowly becoming irrelevant due to the emergence of structures like the European Union
 lekin yah tark bahut majboot nahin he
 It is true that the countries involved in the European Union have given their consent to form a strong regional organization
 phir bhi, ve ek raashtra-rajya ke rup main apni-apni pahchaan khatm nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Many other regional organizations have also increased cooperation between the countries of the region, but there is no possibility that they will prove to be an alternative to the nation-state
 samakaleen duniya main rajya ek aisi hakeekat he, jiske khatm hone kaa koi asaar nahin he
 Followers of many ideologies opposing it ideologically have failed to finish the institution of the state even if given a practical opportunity

 One day he meets Shivangi and the two fall in love with each other
 iske turant baad donon shaadishuda vivaahit jivan kaa anand lene ke liye vivaah kar lete hai or bas jate hai
 While dining at one night, the couple is approached by a male Vishwanath, who claims that Shivangi is his wife Madhu
 suraj or shivangi chaunk gaye or unhen chhodane ke liye kaha, jo vah karata he
 But the next day this man, with the help of police and courts, proves that Shivangi is actually his wife Madhu
 suraj ne vishwaas karne se inkaar kar diya or shahar ko apni patni ke saath chhodane kaa faisla kiya
 But the couple meets Vishwanath on several other occasions where his attitude becomes aggressive
 vah maanati he ki vah vastav main madhu he
 Madhu was fed up with Vishwanath's constant abuse and arbitrariness
 madhu ke pita ne use bataaya ki vah abhi bhi jawan he or uske aage puraa jivan he
 He should resume his life with a new identity in a new place
 aisa vah karti he
 After hearing his story, Suraj tells him that he still loves her
 vah uske jivan ke baaki hisson ke liye vishwanath ko jail bhejne kii yojana banaata he
