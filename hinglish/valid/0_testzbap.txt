 Its cave is also smaller than Carle's cave
 phir, lagbhag ek tihaai choti yah gupha apurna bhi rah gai he
 It is clear from the sculptures of Buddha built on its outer walls that the Mahayana sect also had a later impact on it and after some time after the Hinayana worship, Buddhist monks severed it which joined again in the Gupta period, though This new relationship brought with it Mahayana worship, which is influenced by the statues of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas

 samasthanik ek hi tatv ke parmaanu jinaki parmaanu sankhya samaan hoti hai, parantu bhaar alag-alag hota he, unhen samasthanik kaha jaataa he
 They contain the same protons in each atom
 jabaki neutron kii sankhya alag alag rahati he
 Because of this, the atomic number remains the same, but the mass of the atom varies
 samasthanik kaa arth "samaan sthaan" se he
 Elements in the periodic table are separated by atomic number, while they are not separated because of the same atomic number in isotopes, hence they are called isotopic
 parmaanu ke nabhik ke bheetar protone kii sankhya ko parmaanu sankhya kaha jaataa he, jo bina aayan vaale parmaanu ke electron ke baraabar hote hai
 Each atomic number identifies a specific element, but does not occur in isotopes
 isamen kisi tatv ke parmaanu main neutron kii sankhya vistrut ho sakati he
 The number of protons and neutrons is the mass number of that atom and each isotopic has a different mass number
 udhaaharan ke liye, carbon ke teen samasthanik carbon-12, carbon-13 or carbon-14 hai
 The mass numbers of all of them are 12, 13 and 14 respectively
 carbon main 6 parmaanu hota he, jiskaa matlab he ki carbon ke sabhi parmaanu main 6 protone hote hai or neutron kii sankhya kramshah 6, 7 or aath he
 The existence of isotopic was first reported by Frederick Soddy in 1913

 16veen shatabdi ke prarambh main samast pashchimi europe dharmik drushti se ek tha - sabhi isai the; sabhi roman katholic carch ke sadsy the; uski parampargat shiksha maanate the or dharmik maamalon main uske adhyaksh arthath rome ke pope kaa shashan sweekaar karte the
 European reforms or reforms refer to the great movement of the 16th century, which resulted in this unity of Western Christians being disintegrated and Protestant religion emerged
 carch ke itihas main samay-samay par sudhaarwadi andolan hote rahe kintu ve carch ke dharmik siddhaton athwa uske shaskaon ko chunauti na dekar unke nirdesh ke anusaar hi naitik buraaiyon kaa unmoolan tathaa dharmik shiksha kaa prachaar apana uddeshy maanate the
 The reform movement that began in the 16th century soon began to oppose both the traditional teaching of the Church and the authority of its rulers
 dharmasudhar andolan ke parinamswaroop europe main catholic sampradaay ke saath-saath luther sampradaay, calvin sampradaay, anglican sampradaay or presbyterian sampradaay prachlit ho gayi
 To understand this new form of reform, it is very important to consider the present situation in Europe
 isa dwaara pravartit katholic carch ke prati isaayiyon main jo shraddha kaa bhav shatabdiyon se chalaa aa rahaa tha vah kai kaarnon se kam ho gaya tha
 In the 14th century, a French pope was elected, who remained in France throughout his life
 iske falswaroop baad main 40 varsh tak do pope vidyaman the, ek france main or ek rome main, jisase samast katholic sansar do bhaagon main vibhakt rahaa
 In the eighth century, the Catholic king of the Franks defeated the Lavard army invading Italy and gave the central part of Italy under the authority of the Pope, and thus became an ordinary ruler in addition to the cleric of the Roman Catholic Church
 is kaaran germany or france ke raja sahaj hi carch ke maamalon main or visheshkar pope ke chunaav main hastkshep karne kaa prayaas karte rahe
 In the late 14th century, this election became a competition ground for Italian elites, focusing less on the individual's merit and more on his lineage
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki us samay nitant ayogy popon kaa chunaav hua or rome ke darbar main naitikta tathaa dharm kii upeksha hone lagi
 So it was quite natural for the Church of Rome to lose respect
 asantosh kaa ek or kaaran yah tha ki samast carch kii sansthaaon par unki sampatti ke anusaar kar lagaaya jaataa tha or rome ke pratinidhi sarvada ghumkar yah rupaya vasuul karte the
 Apart from this predicament of the central organization of the Church, the condition of various religions was not satisfactory
 is samay samast pashchimi europe lagbhag saat sau dharmapraanton main vibhakt tha
 Their rulers were called bishops
 ye bishap samant the jo raja dwaara praaia: abhijaat varg main se chune jate the, darbar ke sadsy the or germany main bahudhaa apane kshetra ke raajnneetik shaasha bhi the
 Therefore, many bishops were more interested in politics, less interested in religion and left the religious administration of their homeland to the highly empowered priests of the university
 gaanvon main basanevaale adhikansh saadhaaran purohit ardhashikshit the
 They were unable to give lectures and were often poor
 saadhaaran purohiton kii yah dayaneey dasha 16veen shatabdi ke europea katholic carch kii sab se badi kamajori thi
 There was no one to teach religious education to the general public except the visiting Franciscans etc
 isse sarvatra andhvishwaas fail gaya or karmkand ko anaavashyak evam asantulit mahatv diy jane laga
 In the 13th century, Catholic theology gave a rational representation of the doctrines through the Christian interpretation of Aristotle and the Scholastic Philosophy, but in the 15th century the focus and contemplation of the fundamental problems of religion were removed
 vishvavidhyalayon main dharmapandit gaun prashnon ke vishay main apane matbhedon ko adhik mahatv dene lage the jisase katholic dharmavigyaan itan nishpraan ho gaya tha ki kuch saadhakon kii yah dharna drudh ho gai thi ki dharmavigyaan sadhana main baadhak he
 Thus we see that there was a need for reform in all the areas of the church and the movement for reforms became imperative
 14veen shatabdi main angarej vicliff or baad main bohemia ke na hus jo sikhalaane lage the ki carch kaa sanghathan, uske sanskaar aadi yah sab manushyon kaa avishkaar he; isaayiyon ke liye bible hi paryaapt he
 Even at that time those ideas did not get much success, but their influence on Luther is obvious
 spain main tolido ke arbobishap cemeness ne carch ke anushaasan ke andar dharmasudhar andolan pravartit kiya jisase vahaan kaa vaataavaran purna rup main badal gaya kintu pashchimi europe main carch kii paristhiti main koi vishesh parivartan nahin ho paaya tha
 When Luther raised his voice against Rome, he had unprecedented success for another reason
 europe main us samay sarvatra pracheen unani tath latin sahitya kii lokapriyata ke saath saath ek naveen saanskrithik andolan prarambh hua jise rinesaan athwa navajagaran kaha gaya he
 As a result, a sense of personal freedom arose in the people
 mudran ke avishkaar ke kaaran isi samay se bible kii mudrit pratiyaan adhik saraltapurvak sulabh hone lagi thim, jisase logon ko apni ore se dharm ke vishay main sochane or bible ko apni nijee vyakhya karne kii pravriti ko bhi protsaahan milane laga tha
 The historical development of the European Reformation is as follows: It began with Luther's rebellion in 1517 AD
 unhone kin paristhitiyon main apana andolan pravartit kiya tha or carch ke kin paramparaagat siddhanto kaa virodh karke kis prakaar ek nayaa dharm chalaaya tha, iskaa varnan vishwakosh main anyatra kiya gaya he 
 At that time all of Germany was divided into about four hundred independent states
 unke adhikansh shaskaon ne katholic samrat charles ke virodh main luther ko sarankshan pradaan kiya or apni praja ko luther ke carch main mila diya
 Soon all the Scandinavian Christians also joined the Lutheran religion
 switsraland main dharmasudhar ke do netaa sarvapradhan the - jurik main jinvagli or janeeva main calovin, donon ke anuyaayi baad main ek hi kelvinist carch main sammilit ho gaye
 The sect also spread to Holland, Scotland and parts of France
 scotland main iskaa naam presbytareey dharm rakhaa gaya he france main pehle luther kaa prabhaav padaa kintu baad main vahaan ke adhikansh protestat dharmavalambee, jo yugani kehalaate hai, calovin ke anuyaayi ban gaye
 His organization was active for a long time as a political party
 england ke raja ne prarambh hi se luther kaa virodh kiya tha
 He also wrote a treatise in which he gave the pope's divine right to matters of religion
 yadhyapi henry jivan bhar apane rajya main protestant siddhanton kaa prachaar rokane kaa prayaas karte rahe, phir bhi unhone vyaktigat kaarnon se 1531 i
 main england kaa carch rome se alag kar diya, is prakaar anglican samudaay prarambh hua tha
 The Protestant ideology had a profound influence on the church during the time of Henry's successors, which is now considered one of the three major branches of Protestant religion, but the Anglican community in fact has its own distinct history of origin, development and propagation
 in teen sampradaayon ke atirikt dharmasudhar andolan ke falswaroop protestant dharm ke or bahut se upsampradaayon kaa udbhav hua jinka yahan par ullekh karnaa anaavashyak he
 Some details of the sects which are of relatively more importance are given elsewhere in the dictionary
 is simhavlokan se spasht ho jaataa he ki luther dwaara pravartit sudhaar andolan ne vibhinn rup dhaaran kar samast europe ko hilaa diya
 Initially the reform of the church was the aim of this movement, but it soon began to attack the traditional education of the church and the organizational unity of the church
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki europe ke isaisansar kii ekta shatabdiyon ke liye chhin-bhinn ho gai
 Completely independent sects emerged from the point of view of governance, which, while believing the same Jesus and the Bible, give different opinions about many fundamental religious principles
 raajnneetik drushti se dharmasudhar kaa parinaam bahut hi vyapak rahaa
 The later condition of Europe was such that the rulers too inevitably took an active part in this religious movement
 ve apni praja ko apane hi dharm main sammilit karne athwa banaae rakhane ke uddeshy se yuddh karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 Thus many wars in the name of religion are discussed in the history of Europe, such as the 30-year war in Germany, the Yugno War in France and the successful freedom struggle against Emperor Charles v in Holland
 upar iskaa ullekh ho chukaa he ki katholic carch main samay samay par sudhaar andolanon kaa pravarttan hota rahaa he kintu 16veen shatabdi ke vidrohatmak dharmasudhar se katholic carch ko vishesh rup se prerana mili
 This century saw the election of talented individuals as pope who have again given priority to spirituality under the rule of the Church, which again led to the reappearance of the pope in the entire Catholic world
 bishpon kii samantshahi ko samaapt kar diya gaya or chaaron or sadhuswabhaav vyaktiyon kii niyukti se janata ke saamne bishap kaa pracheen adarsh ubharne laga, jo apni praja kaa dharmaguru evam aadhyatmik charvaaha he
 The 19th World Assembly of the Church was organized in the city of Trent, in addition to the new organization of the Church, in particular the teaching of ordinary priests was arranged
 at: carch kii sabhi shreniyon main sudhaar hua or jansadharan main dharmik shiksha kaa uchit prachaar ho sakaa
 In this work, religious leaders have shared the hands of other priests
 16veen shatabdi main jesuit aadi kai dharmasanghon kii sthapana hui tathaa pracheen dharmasanghon main sudhaar laayaa gaya jisase ve sabake sab samay kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar dharm kii seva kar saken
 In this way, we see that perhaps the most profound and beneficial effect of the Reformation was on the old Catholic Church
 europea dharmasudhar kaa vyapak prasar evam gaharaa prabhaav dekhakar anayas hi man main yah prashn uthta he ki is apurv safalataa kaa kya rahasy he
 Several reasons for this success have been conceived: 15veen shatabdi ke aarambh main katholic carch kii dayaneey dasha or iske karnadhaaron kii niskriyata, carch kii sampati hadapney ko utsuk rajanetaaon kii sahaayta, navajagaran ke kaaran vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa andolan, mudran ke avishkaar se prachaar kii nai suvidhaayen
 All this proved to be helpful for the under-reported movement, but the secret of its success must be found elsewhere
 dharmasudhar ke pravartak satvik or dharmik bhav se prerit the or ve apane pratibhashali sahyogiyon main bhi dharmik navajagaran kii utkar abhilaashaa utpann karne main samarth hue
 In his view, the only remedy for that renaissance seemed to be that man would not surrender to Jesus by believing in his virtuous deeds, and believe in the Bible's gospel of Jesus safely
 unhone bible ko apane andolan kaa aadhaar bana liya, bible main jo shakti nihit he usee ke dwaara unhen safalataa mili he
 Nowadays 16th century events are being considered in the Christian world in neutral terms
 kathilak europea dharmasudhar kii rachanaatmak uplabdhiyon ko sweekaar karte hai or protetianst samajhane lage hai ki carch kii tatkaaleen buraaiyon kaa virodh karnaa kitna hi aavashyak kyon na tha, uski ekta chhin bhinn karne se isai dharm ko bahut haani hui he
 After the Second World War, the movement for Christian unity has been given utmost importance and the desire to remove the ill effects of the reforms is increasing
 martin luther ke purv dharmasudharkon ne chaudaavin sadi se hi carch or popashahi kii aniatikta, bhrashtataa, vilasita or shoshan ke viruddh apni aawaaj buland kii or unhone dharm sudhaar kii prishth bhoomi taiyaar kii

 The foundation of social justice as an idea is based on the urge to treat all human beings as equal
 iske mutabik kisi ke saath saamaajik, dharmik or saanskrithik purvargrahon ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav nahin hona chahie
 Everyone should have such minimum resources that they can bring their concept of 'perfect life' to the earth
 viksit hon yaa vikasshil, donon hi tarah ke deshon main raajnneetik siddhant ke daayre main saamaajik nyaay kii is avadharana or usase judi abhivyaktiyon kaa pramukhataa se prayog kiya jaataa he
 But this does not mean that its meaning is always clear
 siddhantkaron ne is pratyay kaa apane-apane tareeke se istemaal kiya he
 In the field of practical politics too, the slogan of social justice has been a major basis for political mobilization of underprivileged groups in a country like India
 udaarataavaadi maanakeey raajnneetik siddhant main udaarataavaadi-samtawaad se aage badhate hue saamaajik nyaay ke siddhantikaran main kai aayam judate gayi hai
 For example, minority rights, multiculturalism, native rights etc
 isi tarah, nariwad ke daayre main striyon ke adhikaron ko le kar bhi vibhinn staron par siddhantikaran hua he or stri-shashaktikaran ke muddon ko unke saamaajik nyaay se jod kar dekha jane laga he
 Although the idea of social justice can be seen in the basic teachings of various religions as an idea, most of the religions or sects which came into existence or how they later developed, have many types of high and low Differentiation added

 Classical liberalism overcame all kinds of old stereotypes and traditions from humans and set them free to live life according to their will
 iske tahat har munashya ko swatantraaa dene or uske saath samanta kaa vyavhaar karne par jor zarur tha, lekin ye sari baaten aupchaarik swatantraaa yaa samanta tak hi simati hui thim
 Later in the early nineteenth century, many liberals advocated for the economic well-being of individuals by the intervention of the state and enabling them to consume their freedom
 kai utapian samaajwaadiyon ne bhi ek aise samaaj kii kalpana kii jahaan aarthik, saamaajik yaa saanskrithik aadhaar par logon ke saath bhedbhaav na hota ho
 Clearly, there was a deep concern for social justice in all these ideas
 iske baavjood marks ne in sabhi vichaaron kii aalochana kii or jor diya ki nyaay jaisi avadharana kii aavashyaktaa poonjeewaad ke bheetar hi hoti he kyonki is tarah kii vyavastha main utpaadan ke sadhano par kabza jamaaye kuch log bahusankhyak sarvhaara kaa shoshan karte hai
 Through the revolution, he set a goal to establish a system where everyone has the conditions to work to the best of their ability and achieve things according to their needs
 lekin beesvin sadi ke purvardh main marxvad or udaarataavaad kaa jo vyaavhaarik rup saamne aayaa, vah unke aashwaasano jaisaa na ho kar vikrut tha
 The totalitarian structures of Stalinism began to emerge a few years after the Russian Revolution inspired by Marxism
 vahiin udaarataavaad or poonjeewaad ne aantarik jatiltaaon ke kaaran duniya ko do vishwa-yudhon, mahamandi, fasiwad or najivaad jaisi bheeshantaaon main dhakel diya
 To overcome the crisis of capitalism, all possible measures were tried in capitalist countries, from the classical liberal formula to the Kinsist policies
 is puure sandarbh main saamaajik nyaay kii baaten nepathy main chali gayin yaa sirf inkaa dikhaave ke taur par prayog kiya gaya
 During this period, in the struggles against colonialism, the talk of human liberation and the entitlements of the weaker sections of the society were raised vigorously
 khaas taur par bhartiya swatantraaa andolan main sabhi tabakon ke liye saamaajik nyaay ke mudde par gambheer bahes chali
 From this debate, provisions like reservation in Parliament and jobs for the deprived sections of society, giving rights to minorities according to their faith and preserving their language, were agreed upon
 baad main ye sahmatiyaan bhartiya samvidhan kaa bhaag baniin
 Along with this, in the normative liberal theory, the issue of taxation by the state on high income people for the betterment or welfare of certain sections of society remained controversial
 kines ne poonjeewaad ko mandi se ubaarane ke liye rajya ke hastkshep ke zariye rojgaar paidaa karne ke praavdhaanon kaa suzav diya, lekin fraderikh vaan haayak, milton freedman or baad main robert nozic jaise vidwaanon ne aarthik gatividhiyon main rajya ke hastkshep kii aalochana kii
 These people believed that this hurt the freedom and economic freedom of the person
 jon rolls ne 1971 main apni kitaab a thiyari of justise main taqatvar daleelein deen akhir kyon samaaj ke kamazor tabakon kii bhalaai ke liye rajya ko sakriy hastkshep karnaa chahie
 In his theory, Rawls appears to present the concept of pure procedural justice, trying to achieve the goal of distributive justice
 apane nyaay ke siddhant main unhone har kisi ko samaan swatantraaa ke adhikaar kii tarafadaari kii
 At the same time it was clarified through discriminatory theory that social and economic differences should be adjusted in such a way that it benefits the most deprived sections
 baad ke varshon main rolls ke siddhant kii kai aalochanaayen bhi saamne aayin, jo darasal saamaajik nyaay ke sandarbh kai naye ayaamon kaa pratinidhitiv karti thim
 In this context, criticisms made by communityists and feminists can be specially mentioned
 samudayavaadiyon ne saamaanya taur par udaarataavaad or vishesh rup se rolls ke siddhant kii isliye aalochana kii ki isamen vyakti kii anuvaadi sankalpana pesh kiya gaya he
 The person Rawls conceptualizes is completely cut off from his context and community
 baad main, 1980 ke dashak ke aakiri varshon main, udaarataavaadiyon ne samudayavaadiyon kii aalochanaon ko udaarataavaad ke bheetar samyojit karne kii koshish kii jiske parinamswaroop bahusamskritwad kii sankalpana saamne aayi
 It held that minority groups can be judged realistically only when they have the freedom to defend and publicly express various aspects of their culture
 iske liye yah zaruri he ki inke saamudayik adhikaron ko manyata di jaae
 Thus multiculturalism at the level of theoretical discourse added a new dimension to the concept of social justice
 yahan ullekhneey he ki saath ke dashak se hi pashchim main nariwadi andolan, naagarik adhikaar andolan, ge, lesbian or trans-gender andolan or paryaavaran andolan aadi ubharne lage the
 In later decades, their spread increased and they also deepened the theoretical discourse
 masalan, nariwadiyon ne udaarataavaad or rolsvaadi ruparekha kii aalochana kii
 Through her analysis, she underscored patriarchy as the biggest obstacle in the path of equal rights for feminists
 isi tarah, ge, lesbian or trans- gender logon ne samaaj main ‘saamaanya’ yaa ‘narmal’ kii varchasvi ruparekha par sawaal uthaaya or apane liye samaan sthiti kii maang kii
 Black people in the West, particularly in American society, demanded equality for themselves through civil rights movements
 mul nivaasiyon ne bhi apane saanskrithik adhikaron kii maang karte hue bahut saare andolan kiye hai
 Multiculturalists have tried to cover all these aspects in their theoretical framework
 in sabhi pahaluon ne saamaajik nyaay ke arth main kai naye aayam jode hai
 This shows that social justice has a different meaning for diverse groups
 asal main vikasshil samaajon main pashchimi samaajon kii tulana main saamaajik nyaay zyaada radical rup main saamne aayaa he
 In South Africa, for example, black people staged a fierce struggle against apartheid and their stake in power
 is sangharsh kii prakruti america main kaale logon dwaara chalaaye gayi sangharsh se is arth main alag thi ki dakshin africa main kaale logon ko zyaada damankaaree sthiti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha
 The example of India is also notable in this context
 bahusamskritwad ne jin saamudayik adhikaron par jor diya unamem se kai adhikaar bhartiya samvidhan main pehle se hi darj hai
 But here social justice emerged as the slogan of struggle in real politics
 masalan, bhimrao ambedkar or utpeedit jatiyon or samudaayon ke kai netaa samaaj ke haashiye par padi jatiyon koshikshit or sangathit hokar sangharsh karte hue apane nyaaypurna haq ko hasil karne kii viraasat rach chuke the
 Similarly in the fifties and sixties, Ram Manohar Lohia emphasized that backward, Dalits, minorities and women should unite and fight for social justice
 lohia chaahate the ki ye samooh ekajute hokar satta or naukariyon main unchi jatiyon ke varchasv ko chunauti den
 With this background, social justice became a major slogan of Indian politics after the nineties
 iske kaaran abhi tak satta se dur rahe samoohon ko satta kii raajnneeti ke centre main aane kaa mauka mila
 It is important to note that environmental movements are going on in India too
 lekin ye ladaaiyaan sthaneey samudaayon ke apane ‘jal, jangal or jameen’ ke sangharsh se judi hui hai
 Similarly, in developing societies, minority groups are fighting against their prejudices and demanding better facilities for themselves
 is arth main saamaajik nyaay kaa sangharsh logon ke astitv or asmita se judaa hua sangharsh he
 It cannot be denied that the slogan of social justice has led various sections in different societies to demand and struggle for dignified life for themselves
 saidhantik vimarsh main bhi utapian samaajwaad se lekar vartmaan samay tak saamaajik nyaay main bahut saare aayam judate gayi hai
 It is also noteworthy that the struggle for social justice is more complex in developing societies than in developed societies
 adhikansh maukon par in samaajon main logon ko saamaajik nyaay ke sangharsh main bahut zyaada sanrachaatmak hinsa or kai maukon par rajya kii hinsa kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa he
 But the struggles for social justice have resulted in fundamental changes in these societies
 kul mila kar samay ke saath saamaajik nyaay ke siddhantikaran main kai naye aayam jude hai or ek sankalpana yaa naare ke rup main isane lambe samay tak khamosh yaa nepathy main rahane vaale samoohon ko bhi apane ke liye jaagrit kiya he

 Blake, considered by his contemporaries to be eccentric due to dispositional peculiarities, was later highly respected by critics for his expressiveness and constructivism, and for the philosophical and mystic underpinnings of his compositions
 Due to its widespread presence in the 18th century, his paintings and poetry were considered part of the Romantic movement and "pre-romanticism"
 bible ke prashansak lekin england ke carch ke virdohi, blake french or american aadarshon or krantiyon dwaara prabhavit the saath hi unpar jaikab bom emanuel swedenberg jaise vichaarkon kaa bhi prabhaav padaa
 Despite these known influences, Blake's singularity makes it difficult to put him in a class

 Historian Peter Marshall called Blake one of the pioneers of modern anarchism along with his contemporary William Godwin

 On 4 August 1772, Blake became the handyman of the carvings Jams Baysire of Great Queen Street for 7 years
 is avadhi ke aakhir main 21 saal kii umr main ve ek vyavsaayik nakkaash ban gaye
 There is no description of any serious differences and conflict between the two during Blake's apprenticeship
 haalanki peter acroyd dwaara likhi jeevani main yah likhaa gaya he ki blake ko baad main baisair ke naam ko kala virodhiyon kii suchi main shaamil karnaa padaa- or phir ise kaat dena padaa

 Two years later, Baysayer sent his handyman to imitate paintings from the Gothic Church of London, and his experiences at Westminster Abbey led to his own style of art and his own ideas; In his time Abe was depicted in armor suits, painted funerary statues and embellished with wax creations of many colors

 blake ne aibe main or bhi drishy dekhe, sanyaasiyon or padariyon kaa ek bada juluus, jab unhone “sade geet or christmas geeton ke gayan” sune
 On 8 October 1779 Blake became a student of the Royal Academy of the Somerset House near Strand
 s jabaki unke adhyayan kii sharton ke anusaar unhen bhugtan nahin karnaa tha, par unase ummid kii gai ki ve apni samagriyon kii chah saal kii avadhi ke dauraan khud aapurti karen
 vahaan, unhone us baat ke khilaaf vidroh kar diya, jise vah rubence jaise fashneble kalakaaron, jinaki skool ke pehle adhyaksh joshua reynolds dwaara himaayat kii gai thi, kii adhuri style ke rup main maanate the
 Over time Blake found Reynold's attitude towards art uninteresting, especially his penchant for "general Truth" and "general Beauty"
 Reynolds wrote in his Discourses that "the inclination to abstraction, generalization and classification is the special splendor of the human mind"; Blake reacted in his personal copy to the side comment, "it is stupid to generalize"; Specializing is the only peculiarity of talent "
 Blake also disliked Reynolds' apparent humility, which he considered hypocrisy
 reynolds ke fashneble tailchitron ke viruddh blake unke aarambhik prabhaavon, mikelangelo tathaa rafel, kii kalasical sateekta ko pasand kiya
 David Bindman suggested that the president's opinion of Blake's opposition to Reynolds was not as much as "his opposition to the hypocrisy of not turning his ideas into action"
 Certainly Blake was reluctant to exhibit at the Royal Academy
 There were no, in which he collected the works on 6 occasions between 1780 and 1880
 blake ke pratham jeevanikar elexander gilcrist ne yah vivaran diya he ki 1780 main blake, baisair kii duukaan kii ore great queen street par ja rahe the, jab ve ek ugr bheed kii chapet main aa gaye jisane landan ke newget jail ko tod daalaa
 unhone jail ke daravaajon par fawdon or kulhadiyon se hamalaa kiya, bhawan main aag laga di or andar band kaidiyon ko chhudaa liya
 During this attack, rumors emerged that Blake was at the forefront of the crowd
 ye hamale roman catholism ke khilaaf pratibandh lagane vaale parliament ke ek bill ke virodh main hue the, jise baad main gordon royts ke naam se janaa gaya
 He sparked a revolt against the laws of the government of George III and the formation of the first police force
 gilcrist ke is baat par jor dene ke baavjood, ki blake ko balpurvak bheed main shaamil kiya gaya tha, kuch jeevani lekhakon ne yah daleel di he ki unhone bheed kaa anusaran aaveg purvak kiya, athwa ek krantikari kaary ke rup main iskaa samarthan kiya
 Jerome mcgann, on the other hand, says that Balve was reactionary and that those events may have filled Blake's mind with "hatred"
 varsh 1782 main blake jon flaxman se mili, jo unke sangrakshak bane or catherine bouchar, jo unki patni baniin
 us samay blake us sambadh se ubar rahe the, jo shaadi main parinat nahin ho sakaa
 unhone apane dil tuutane kii kahani catherine or unke mata-pita ko sunai, iske baad unhone catherine se poocha, “kya tum mujhe dukhi karogi?” jab unhone nishchayatmak rup main jawaab diya to blake ne ghoshnaa kii, “main tumhen pyaar karata hum
" blake ne catherine se 18 agast 1782 ko, batersi ke saint mairi carch main shaadi kar lee, jo unase 5 saal choti thim
 Educated Catherine signed her marriage agreement with 'X'
 mul vivaah pramaan patr ko abhi bhi carch main dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan ek yaadgaar rangeen-kaanch ko 1976 se 1982 ke bich sthapit kiya tha
 In addition to teaching Catherine to write and read later, Blake trained her as a carpenter
 jivan bhar unke liye catherine bahumoolya vardaan sabit huin, jinhone unki prasiddh kritiyon ko print karne or kai museebaton main unke utsaah ko banaae rakhane main madad kii
 At this time George Cumberland, who was one of the founders of the National Gallery, became an admirer of Bückel's works
 The first collection of poems by Blake Poetical Sketches was published in the year 1783
 apane pita kii mrityu ke baad wiliam or unke bhai robert ne 1784 main ek print kii duukaan khol lee or krantikari prakaashak josef johnson ke saath kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Johnson's home was the meeting place of some of the pioneering British intellectuals of the time: theologian scholar and scientist Joseph Priestley, the philosopher Richard Price, the artist John Henry Fuseli, the early feminist Mary Wulstoncraft, and the American revolutionary Thomas Penn
 wiliam vardsaworth or wiliam godwin ke saath-saath blake ko french or america krantiyon se badi ummiden thi or ve french krantikariyon ke saath apni ekajutata pradarshit karne ke liye frigian cap pahante the, lekin robspier tathaa france main aatank ke shashan kii utpatti ke kaaran niraash hue

 langik samanta or vivaah sanstha par donon ke vichaar saajhe lagate hai, lekin is baat kaa koi pramaan nahin miltaa he ki donon kii vastav main bhent hui thi
 In the 1793 Vision of the Daughters of Albion, Blake condemned the alleged sexual hygiene and the cruel anomaly of marriage without love and favored the right of women to complete complacency
 1788 main, 31 varsh kii umr main, blake ne relif eaching ke saath prayog karnaa aarambh kiya, jo aisi vidhi thi jiskaa prayog ve apane adhiktar kitabon, chitron, parchon or, beshak, apni kavitaaon jinamein unki lambii ‘frofeses’ or unki sarvshereshth rachana da "bible" shaamil thi, ke nirmaan main kiya
 This process is also known as illuminated printing and the works produced from it were called illuminated books or prints
 iluminated printing main shaamil he kavitaaon ke shabdon ko tambe kii patticoon par kalam athwa brush kii madad se likhnaa, jisamen amlarodhi madhyam kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 The illustrations appeared alongside the words as in the earlier painted manuscripts
 tab ve tambe kii pattiyon ko amla main nikshaarate the taaki anupachaarit tamba ghul jaae or relif main digaayan chap jaae 
 This is in contrast to the general method of etching, where the design rows are exposed to acid and the plaque was printed by the intaglio method
 relif eaching kaa uddeshy unki sachitr pustakon ko integleo kii tulana main or adhik teevr gati se taiyaar karnaa tha
 The stereotype process was invented in 1725, which involved the fabrication of a metallic cast from a wood carving, but Blake's invention was considered quite different, as noted above
 in pattiyon se print kiye prishthon ko tab jalarang dwaara haath se ranga jaataa tha or wolum banane ke liye unhen aapas main natthi kar di jaati thi
 Blake has used illuminated printing for most of his well-known compositions, including Songs of Innocence and Experience, The Book of thel, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and Jerusalem
 yadhyapi blake apane relif eaching ke liye kaaphi mashhoor hue, unki vyavsaayik kritiyon main pramukh rup se integleo nakkashi kaa hi prayog hua he, jo 18veen sadi main nakkashi kii maanak prakriya thi, jisamen kalakaar chitra ko tambe ke plate par ukerte the
 It was a complex and painstaking process that took months or years for the plates to complete, but as noted by Buckell's contemporary John Boydell, such an engraving was "associated with professionalism", allowing artists to connect with the audience group
 And thus became an important activity by the end of the 18th century
 blake ne apni kritiyon main, visheshkar da book of job, ke chithran ke liye integleo utkeernan vidhi ko apanaaya, jo unki mrityu se thik pehle puri hui
 adhikansh mahatvapurn kaary, takanic ke rup main blake ke relif eaching par kendrit hone laga, kyonki yah unki kala kaa naveenatam swaroop tha, kintu 2009 kaa ek adhyayan hamaara dhyaan blake kii vartmaan main uplabdh patticoon kii ore khinchataa he jisamen ve bhi shaamil hai, jo da book of job ke liye banaae gaye the: ye is baat kii vyakhya karte hai ki unhone us takanic kaa baar-baar prayog kiya jise “ripogez” ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jo pattica ko peeche kii ore se hathode se petakar galatiyon ko sudhaarney kii vidhi thi
 These particular techniques for the engraving compositions of the time were much faster than the fluid drawing method Blake used for his relief etching, and they show why the engraving took longer to complete

 Some biographers have indicated that Blake had also tried to keep a concubine with the beliefs of the Svedenborgian Society, but other scholars dismissed these beliefs as speculation

 main blake, ek kanishtha kavi wiliam hele kii kritiyon kaa chithran karne ke liye sasex main failfam sthit cottage main chale gaye
 In this cottage, Blake started Milton: a Poem
 The role of this composition is given a poem that begins with the line "and Did They Feet in Ancient Time / Way in Ancient Times", which became the words of the anthem called "jerusalem"
 Later, when Blake finds out that his new mentor, Hayley, does not believe in true artistry and is just "a dull business" for him, he is angered by this
 It is believed that Blake's feud with Hayley had an effect on Milton: a Poem, in which Blake wrote "earthly friends are spiritual enemies"

 Blake returned to London in 1804 and began writing and drawing his most ambitious work, Jerusalem
 chosar ke cantarbari tels main paatro ko chitrit karne kaa suzav maanakar blake ne chithran ke vipanan kii baat dhyaan main rakhkar vyapaaree robert chromec se sampark kiya
 Knowing that Blake was taking a psyche in the creation of a popular work, Cromack immediately hired Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to embody the concept
 jab blake ne yah janaa ki unke saath dhokhaa hua he, unhone stothird ke saath sambandh tod liya
 He also held an independent exhibition in his brother's haberdashery shop at 27 Broad Street in Soho district, London
 The purpose of the exhibition was to sell his own adaptation of the Canterbury illustration, among other works
 As a result, he wrote his descriptive catalog, which was what Anthony Blunt called a "brilliant analysis" about Saucer
 It was regularly compiled as a classic form of Saucer's review
 isamen unke anya chitron ke vistrut vivaran bhi die gaye hai
 However, very few people came to the exhibition itself and no tempera or watercolor was sold
 Its only review featured in The Examiner was negative

 At the age of 65, Blake began his portrayal of The Book of Jobs

 Later in his life, Blake began selling a large number of his works, especially his Bible illustration, to Thomas Butts, a mentor who saw Blake more as a friend than a man endowed with artistic talents
 gave; This specific opinion about Blake was maintained throughout his life

 pariyojna ke kabhi puraa nahin hone ke kaaran blake kaa uddeshy aspasht hua ho saktaa he
 Some pointers, however, confirm that Blake's portrayal in its entirety may have taken issue with its enclosed text: Homer Bearing Blake, on the margins of the Sword and His Companions, writes, "every thing of Dante's comedia It shows that for the purpose of oppression, he has created this world as the basis of all and the divine nature, but not as the Holi Gost ”

 Seeing them, Blake shouted and said, “wait! Just be like, i make a portrait of you right now because you have always been an angel for me
 " Upon completion of this portrait, Blake placed his tools and began to sing hymns and verses
 At six that evening, Blake died, promising to be with his wife forever
 gilcrist bataate hai ki usee makaan main rahane vaali ek mahila kirayedar ne, jo unki mrityu ke samay upasthit thi, kaha "main upasthit thi kisi vyakti kii mrityu par nahin balki ek puneatma farishte kii mrityu par"
 In a letter to Samuel Palmer, George Richmond gave the following description: linelle dwaara udhaar die gaye paise se catherine ne blake kii antyeshti ke liye paise chukaaye
 unhen unki mrityu ke paanch din baad unki shaadi kii pantalisvin saalagirah par banhil fields ke decentres kabrgah main dafnaaya gaya, jahaan unke mata-pita bhi dafan kiye gaye the
 Those attending the funeral were Catherine, Edward Calvert, George Richmond, Frederick Tatham and John Linnell
 After Blake's death, Catherine had to work at Tatham's house as a housekeeper
 During this time she kept believing that Blake's soul comes to meet him regularly
 unhone blake kii chitrit kritiyon or chitron ko bechnaa jari rakhaa, lekin bina “shriman blake kii salaah” ke bina unhone koi vyapaarik sauda nahin kiya
 On October 1831, on the day of her own death, Catherine was as calm and happy as her husband and called Blake "as if he was in the next room and she was going to him without delay"
 unki mrityu par, blake kii pandulipiyon kii viraasat fredrick tatham ko mili jisane unamem se anek ko jala daalaa jise vah dharm virdohi athwa rajnatik rup se adhik krantikari maanata tha
 Tatham became Irvingite, one of many conservative campaigns of the 19th century and severely opposed any work that contained "utterances of blasphemy"
 The sexual imagery in many of Blake's paintings was also erased by John Linnell
 1965 se wiliam blake ke dafnane ke sthaan kii sahi-sahi pahchaan kho gai or bhula di gai, jabaki kabr par lage pathar nikaal kar unase nae lon banaae gaye
 These days Blake's tomb is commemorated by an inscription that reads "here are the remains of the poet painter William Blake 1757-1827 and his wife Catherine Sophia 1762-1831"
 This monument is about 20 m from the actual place of unmarked tomb of Shila Blake
 Is located at a distance

 Blake's early works are rebellious in nature and can be seen as resistance against orthodox religion
 yah baat da marriage of hewan and hell main khaas taur par parilakshith hoti he jisamen shaitan darasal paakhandee sattavadi devtaa ke viruddh vidroh karne vaala nayak he
 In later works such as Milton and Jerusalem, Blake portrays a distinctive philosophy of the revival of humanity by virtue of self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his initial negative view against the rigid and corrupt authoritarianism of traditional religion
 blake ke sabhi pathakon main is baat ko lekar sahmati nahin he ki unki pehle or baad kii kritiyon ke bich kitni nirantarata he
 Psychoanalyst Jaune Singer wrote that Blake's later works reflected the development of ideas that were first found in his early works, such as the humanist goal of achieving the individual wholeness of body and soul
 In the last section of the extended issue of his study on The Blake, The Unholy Bible, Jaune suggests that his later works are in fact the "bible of Hell" as promised in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell
 blake kii antim kavita “jerusalem” ke sandarbh main vah likhti hai: The divinity of human beings finally fulfilled in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell
 haalanki jon middlaton mari mariz tathaa baad kii kritiyon ke bich vicchhinnata kii baat likhte hai jisamen aarambh main blake dwaara urja or kaaran ke bich spasht nakaaratmak virodh par dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he, baad main chalakar blake ne aantarik ekaatmata ke path ke rup main aatmatyag or kshamaa ke bhav par jor daalaa he
 This abandonment of the intensified dualism of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is particularly evident by the humanization of Eurigen's character in later works
 middlaton blake kii parvarti kritiyon kii visheshta “aapasi samaj” tathaa “ek duusare ke liye kshamaa” ke rup main bataate hai
 Blake sometimes considered the 19th-century free love movement and marriage as slavery and all restrictions imposed by the state on sexual activity such as homosexuality, prostitution and even adultery at the core of the early 20th century family planning movement
 The elaborate reform that began in 1820 advocating abolition is considered a precursor to the tradition
 blake kii vidwata aaj kii bajaae 20veen shatabdi kii vishaywastu par adhik kendrit thi, haalanki mukhyat: blake par kaam karne vaale vidwaan megnas ancarzo ke dwaara, jisane is vyakhya ko sanyampurvak chunauti di he, is baat kaa zikr aaj bhi kiya jaataa he
 The free-love movement of the 19th century was not particularly focused on the idea of more than one sexual partner, but it was agreed with Wolstoncraft's opinion that state-approved marriage was "legal prostitution" and that its character was monopolistic
 purvavarti nariwadi aandolanon se isaki bahut samanta thi
 Blake was a critic of the marriage rules of his time and generally condemned the traditional Christian belief that sexual virtue was a virtue
 apni shaadi ke jabardast tanaav ke dauraan, jiskaa kaaran yah tha ki catherine pratyaksh rup se santan utpann karne main aksham thi, unhone sidhe-sidhe duusari patni ghar main laane kii vakaalat kii
 unke kavy ke anusaar vaivaahik vafadari kii maang ke kaaran prem sachche lagaav kii jagah ek jimmedaari bhar ban kar rah jaataa he
 His poetry condemns marriage rules as the cause of jealousy and arrogance
 “whai shud ai bi bound tu di”, “o maai lavali mertal-tree?” or “arths ancer” jaisi kavitaayen ekaadhik yon saathiyon kii vakaalat karti hui lagati hai
 His poem "london" speaks of marriage "
 The Vision of the Daughters of Albion is widely regarded as a tribute to free love, with Bromian and Othune being by law and not by love
 blake ke liye kanoon or prem do virdohi baaten hai or ve “produn mariz-bed” ko fatkaar lagaate hai
 Blake writes in Wijns: til shi hu barnj vid youth, and noz no phixd lot, iz boundin spelz of laa tu van shi loths? and must shi draig da channof life in viri last? Charles Swinburne, a famous 19th-century poet and advocator of free love, wrote an entire book on Blake drawing attention to the above motive, in which Blake praises the "pure natural love" that is the authoritative envy of others, whom Blake calls " Is regarded as a "crawling skeleton"
 Swinburne also writes about how Blake's work Marriage of Heaven and Hell condemns the "bleak religious dissipation" of those advocating conservative rules
 mukt prem ke 19veen shatabdi ke ek buddhijivi edward carcentr bhi blake ke bahya pratibandhon se mukt rahasywaadee vichaar se prabhavit the
 In the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's approach resembles Mary Wulstoncraft's idea of joyful true love, rather than duty-based love, in which joyful true love is considered the true measure of purity
 yrine langrij likhti hai ki blake ke rahasywaadee or gaiyr roodhiwaadee mat ke anusaar mukt prem kaa siddhant kuch aisa he jise blake "aatma" kii unnati ke liye chaahate hai maaikel david kii 1977 kitaab wiliam blake new kind of main sweekaar karata he ki blake ke vichaar main manushya ko daivi ekatv se alag karne vaala kaarak irshyaa he jiske kaaran vah neeche girakar ek thandi maut kaa bhaagi banataa he
 As a theologian writer Blake has a sense of "inferiority" of man
 es
 foster daiman ne likhaa he ki blake ke liye mukt prem aadhaarit samaaj kii raah main bade aadchan the dooshit maanav prakruti or na keval samaaj kii ashishnutaa tathaa manushya ke prati irshyaa balki maanviya sampreshan kii juthi paakhandee prakruti
 thomas rhite 1928 main apni kitaab life of wiliam blake main likhte hai ki blake sochate hai ki vyavhaar main vivaah ko prem ke anand par aadhaarit hona chahie, lekin vastav main praaia: aisa nahin hota kyonki jab pati-patni ko bandhe hone kaa ehsaas hota he tab unki khushi jaati rahati he
 Analyzing early mythological poems such as Ahania, by Pierre Berger Blake, states that the laws of marriage are caused by the degeneration of humans because they are born of ego and envy
 kuch vidwaanon ne likhaa he ki "mukt prem" par blake ke vichaar saapeksh hai or unke jivan ke antim varshon main unamem badlaav or roopantaran bhi hua ho saktaa he
 Some poems from this period such as The Sick Rose warn about the dangers of forced sexuality
 megnas ancarzo likhte hai ki yadhyapi vijance of da dotrs of albion kii nayika mukt prem kii ek prabal samarthak he, kavita ke ant main apni yonta ke andhere paksh se apana parichay badhane par vah adhik satark hokar cheekhti he “kya yah prem ho saktaa he jo duusare ko sokhta he jaise ki spanj pani ko?” ancarzo yah bhi likhte hai ki blake kii ek badi prerana strot mairi woolstencraft apane jivan ke baad ke dinon main yon swatantraaa ke bare main isi tarah ke adhik satark vichaar dhaaran karti hai
 In the light of Blake's sense of human inferiority described earlier, Ancarzo's view that Blutha's complete attachment to disobedience of the law, as evident from the example of Lutha's feminine character, completely agrees, was not a matter of experience
 In the Adham world, all love is bonded
 ancarzo blake dwaara saathiyon kii saajhedaari vaale ek commune ko samarthan dene kii charchaa karte hai, haalanki david warel ne abhi haal main da book of thel kaa paath swedenbergian carch ke kuch sadasyon dwaara rakhaalon ko apnaane ke prastaav ko asweekaar karne ke rup main kiya he
 Blake's later writings reflect his newfound interest in Christianity, and although he reinterpreted basic Christian ethics in a way that incorporates sensual pleasures, many of his early poems emphasize sexual liberty as nonexistent
 And "self-denial" have been supported, although such self-denial would certainly be motivated by love rather than by authoritarian compulsion Ahia
 Berger is particularly sensitive to changes in sensation between Blake's earlier and later compositions
 barger pate hai ki yuva blake aavegon ke anusaran par zyada bal dete hai or umr bitne par sachche prem ke us achche adarsh ke himachati ho jate hai jisamen sachcha aatmatyag shaamil hota he
 a Yashogan of mystic sensibility is found in later poems
 However, later poems emphasize more on emotional truth as the basis of forgiveness, liberation, and relationships
 yadhyapi blake dwaara roodhiwaadee dharm par prahaar kiya janaa unke samay main ek sann kar dene vaali baat thi, dharmikata ke liye unka nishedh apane aap main dharm kaa nishedh nahin tha
 His approach to conservatism is evident from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, a series of lessons written in imitation of biblical prophecy
 usamen blake ne nark kii anek uktiyon kii suchi di he jisamen nimnlikhit shaamil he: In The Everlasting Gospel, Blake portrays Jesus Christ as a supreme creator by not presenting him as a philosopher or traditional messiah who goes beyond doctrine, logic, and even morality: blake ke liye isamsih devatv tathaa manushyata ke bich jivan se bharpoor sambandh or unki ekta ke pratik hai: “sabaki bhashaa mulat: ek thi or sabakaa dharm mulat: ek tha: yah tha isamsih kaa dharm, evarlasting gospel 
 pracheenta isamsih ke siddhant kaa upadesh detii he
 " blake ne apane myth khud taiyaar kiye the jo unki bhavishyasuchak pustakon main vyapak rup se dikhaai padate hai
 Among them, Blake has depicted a number of letters including 'eurigen', 'anithearnan', 'bromian' and 'louva'
 It seems that the basis of this mythology is the Bible and Greek mythology and it follows their view of the Everlasting Gospel
 roodhiwaadee isai mat ke prati blake kaa sabase prabal virodh yah he ki yah kudarti ichchhaaon ke daman ko protsaahit karata he or sansaarik sukh kii ninda karata he
 In a Vision of the Last Judgment, Blake says: dharm sambandhi unke kathanon ko da marriage of hewan and hell main dekha ja saktaa he: Blake did not hold the belief that the body is separate from the soul and that the body should be subject to the law of the soul, but instead they consider the body to be an extension of the soul which is derived from the perceptiveness of the senses / senses
 is prakaar, shaareerik ichchhaaon ko nakaarne par roodhiwaadiyon dwaara jo bal diya jaataa he vah ek dwandvatmak dosha he jo sharir or aatma ke sambandh kii galat vyakhya se paidaa hua he; anyatra, ve shaitan ko ‘dosha kii avasthaa’ ke rup main tathaa moksh se pare kii vastu ke rup main varnit karte hai
 Blake opposed the idea of a theology related to relieving grief, acceptance of the existence of demons and forgiving for injustice
 ve aatm nishedh se nafrat karte the jiskaa sambandh ve dharmik daman se or khaskar yon daman se maanate the: “budhimaani ek amir kintu kurup, budhi daasi he jisase aakshamata pranay nivedan karata he
 / He who desires but not karma, gives rise to misery
 ” unhone ‘paap’ kii avadharana ko manushya kii ichchhaaon ko baandhne vaale phande ke rup main dekha he or unka vishwaas tha ki baahar se aropit naitik aachaar shaastra ke anuroop pratibandh jivan ke utsaah ke viruddh he: They did not believe in God as Lord's doctrine in which God is said to be separate and superior to man, and his words about Jesus make it clear: “he is the only God
 
 or vahi main hum or vahi tum ho”
 da marriage of hewan and hell kii ek ukti he “log yah bhul gaye hai ki sabhi devataaon kaa nivas aadmi ke seene main he”
 yah pankti samaaj main tathaa stri-purushon ke bich swatantraaa or samanta ke unke vishwaas ke bilkul anuroop he
 Blake had a complex relationship with the Enlightenment philosophy
 apane kaalpanik dharmik vishwaason ke chalate, blake ne brahmad ke newtonvaadee drushtikon kaa virodh kiya
 Blake's thoughts in this regard are reflected in his quote from Jerusalem: And there behold the Loom of Locke whose Woof rages dire Washd by the Water-wheels of Newton
 black the cloth In heavy wreathes folds over every Nation; cruel Works Of many Wheels i view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic Moving by compulsion each other: not as those in Eden: which Wheel within Wheel in freedom revolve in harmony & peace
 Blake also believed that Sir Joshua Reynolds' paintings, which reflected the natural phenomena of light over objects, were entirely a product of the "botanical eye" and that Locke and Newton were "the real fathers of Sir Joshua Reynolds's aesthetics
 "believed
 us samay ke england main aise chitron ke prati lok ruchi kii santushti mezotints se kii jaati thi, aise chitra jo prishth ke upar hajaaron nanhen binduon se utpann kii jane vaali prakriya se nirmit hote the
 Blake saw a similarity between it and Newton's particle theory of light
 Similarly, Blake never used the technique, instead he preferred to develop a method of carving in a purely liquid line
 He was adamant on this: prabodhan ke siddhanton ke apane virodh ke baavjood, blake is prakaar ek raikhik saundaryashastra par pahunche jo anek prakaar se romenticon kii kritiyon kii tulana main, jinke saath unhen praaia: vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, jon flaxman kii navaklasical nakkashiyon ke adhik samaan tha
 Hence Blake has also been seen as an enlightened poet and artist, in the sense that he was in tune with the tendency to reject ideas, arrangements, authorities and traditions by that movement
 duusari ore ve us baat ke bhi aalochak the jise ve tark kaa damankaaree praadhikaar kii sthiti tak uthanaa maanate the
 In his criticism of logic, law, and uniformity, Blake has been opposed to Enlightenment, but it has also been debated that in the dialectical sense he encouraged Enlightenment's zeal to deny external authority to criticize Enlightenment's narrow conception Used for northrope frai majbootee se dhaaran kiye vichaaron main blake kii susangati par tippanee karte hue likhte hai ki “blake ne khud kaha he ki 50 kii umr main likhi gai joshua reynolds par unki tippaniyan lock tathaa bekan par unke dwaara apni yuvavastha main likhi gai tippaniyon ke bilkul samaan hai
 Even the syntax and lines of the verses are the same as 40 years later
 Consistency in itself was his main principle in upholding what he believed to be the truth
 

 susangati, tab, chaahe moorkhtapurna ho yaa kuch or blake kii mukhya purvadharanaon main se ek thi thik usee tarah jis tarah ki ‘aatm-khandan’ hameshaa hi unka sabase tiraskaarpurn aalochanon main rahaa he"
 Blake hated slavery and believed in racial and gender equality

 jise vah daman or uchit swatantraaa par pratibandh maanate hai, us par unke vichaar kaa prasar carch tak hua
 His spiritual belief is evidenced by the Songs of Experience in which he distinguishes between the God of the Old Testament, whose restrictions he denies, and the God of the New Testament, whom he sees as a positive influence
 choti umr se hi, wiliam blake kaa daawa ishwar ko dekhne kaa rahaa he
 The first such darshan he made was at the age of four, an affirmation of which the young artist "saw God" when God's "head stared at him at the window", which Blake shouted
 landan ke pekham re main aath yaa das saal kii umr main blake ne “farishton se ladaa ek ped jisaki har shaakh pad taare kii tarah divya daine jade the” dekhne kaa daawa kiya
 According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, when he came home and told him about this philosophy, he was beaten to death by the father on the charge of telling a lie, that too when the mother intervened
 However, all the evidence shows that his parents were very supportive of him, especially many of the early paintings and poems of the mother and Blake were the walls of the mother's room
 ek anya avasar par blake ne kuch ghasiyaaron ko kaam karte dekha or unhen prathit hua ki unhone unke bich daivi akritiyon ko vicharan karte dekha he
 Blake claims to have seen divine scenes throughout his life

 God and Christianity have been the intellectual centers of his writings, which inspired him
 iske alaava, blake kaa vishwaas tha ki unhen maha devdooton dwaara vyaktigat rup se unki kalatmak rachanaaon ke liye nirdeshit or protsaahit kiya jaataa he, jinke bare main unka daawa tha ki ve unheen maha devdooton dwaara sakriy rup se padhe jate hai or unke dwaara unka anand uthaaya jaataa he
 In his letter to William Hayley on 6 May 1800, Blake writes: mujhe pataa he ki hamaare mrit saathi apane jivit rahane ke sthiti kii tulana main aaj hamaare saath adhik hai
 Thirteen years ago i lost a brother of mine and i talk to his soul daily and again and again and i see him in my memory, in my imagination field
 i listen to his advice and still write as told by him

 25 april 1803 ko thomas bat ko likhe apane patr main blake likhte hai: Now i can say to you what i might not dare to say to anyone else: that i can continue my philosophical studies alone in London without bothering and talking to my friends in the hereafter, dreaming , i can imagine the prophecies and remain untargeted by the powers of other gods and can freely say the fable; Kindness may be suspicious, but doubts are always fatal, especially when we doubt our friends

 William Wordsworth commented, "there is no doubt that this man was a poor maniac, but there is something in this man's madness that i am more interested in than the well-being of Lord Byron and Walter Scott"

 buddha kaa janm 563 isa purv main lumbini, nepal or mahaparinirvana 483 isa purv kushinagar, bharat main hua tha
 In the next five centuries of his Mahaparinirvana, Buddhism spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and in the next two thousand years also spread across the central, eastern and southeastern Jambu continent

 Buddha's real name was Siddhartha
 unka janm kapilwastu ke paas lumbini main hua tha
 In this place, Emperor Ashoka built a pillar in the memory of Buddha in the third century BC
 siddharth ke pita shaakyon ke raja shuddhodan the
 According to the traditional tale, Siddhartha's mother Mahamaya died some time after his birth
 kaha jaataa he ki unka naam rakhane ke liye 8 rishiyo ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, sabhi ne 2 sambhaavnaayen bataai thi, ve ek mahaan raja banenge ve ek sadhu yaa parivrajak banenge
 Hearing this speech, King Shuddhodana tried hard not to allow Siddhartha to become a monk to the extent of his ability
 shaakyon kaa apana ek sangh tha
 At the age of twenty, every Shakya Tarun had to be initiated into Shakya Sangha and become a member of the Sangh
 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana
 bharat main buddha dharm kaa navyan sampradaay he jo purnat shuddh, maanavtaavaadi or vigyaanvaadee he
 Template: Main: Theravada saanchaa:main:mahayan Template: Main: Vajrayana saanchaa:main:navyan Five main shrines are considered to be main for followers of Lord Buddha around the world: yah sthaan nepal kii tarai main nautanwaan railway stesan se 25 kilometre or gorakhpur-gonda line ke naugarh stesan se kareeb 12 kilometre dur he
 Now a paved road has also been built from Naugarh to Lumbini
 isa purv 563 main rajkumaar siddharth gautam kaa janm yaheen hua tha
 However, most of the ancient viharas of Buddha's time here have been destroyed
 keval samraat ashok kaa ek stambh avshesh ke rup main is baat kii gavaahi detaa he ki bhagwaan buddha kaa janm yahaan hua tha
 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
 iske baad ve gaya pahunche
 In the end, he vowed that until real knowledge is available, he will not rise from under the Peepal tree, even if he dies
 iske baad kareeb chah din tak din raat ek pipal vriksh ke neeche bhukhe-pyaase tap kiya
 Eventually he attained supreme knowledge or wisdom
 siddharth gautam ab buddhatv paakar akaash jaise anant gyani ho chuke the
 Where does the Pipal tree under which he sits, go to the Bodhi tree i
e
 the tree of knowledge

 The theory of balance of power assumes that a nation is more secure when the military capability is divided in such a way that no single state is so powerful that it alone suppresses other states
 shakti santulan kii avadharana lagbhag 15 veen shatabdi se antarrashtriya str main prachlit he
 Perhaps this is why some writers call it the basic principle of international politics, some call it the public principle or the fundamental principle of politics
 saadhaaran shabdon main shakti santulan kaa arth he jab ek rajya / rajyon kaa samooh duusare rajya / rajyon ke samooh ke saapeksh apni shakti itani badha le ki vah uske samakaksh ho jaae
 But there is no consensus on the definition of this notion
 shaayad isiilie innins el claude kaa kahana he ki yah aisi avadharana he jisaki paribhaasha kii samasya nahin he balki samasya yah he ki isaki bahut sari paribhaashaayen hai
 Before these definitions, it is also necessary to state that there are two types - simple and complex
 saral yaa saadhaaran shakti santulan jab hota he jab yah tulana do raashton yaa do raashton ke bich main sidhe taur par ho
 But if this equilibrium is between the mutual of two communities and also internally in the communities involved, then it is called complex balance
 iske sandarbh main vidwaanon ne vibhinn paribhaashaayen di hai jo is prakaar hai- Every nation aspires to gain more power than other nations to maintain or change the status quo
 iske parinamswaroop jis dhaanche kii aavashyaktaa hoti he vah shakti santulan kehalaata he
 The balance of power is some degree of stability or stability in equilibrium or international relations that can be achieved with the help of treaties or other means between states
 shakti santulan vah vyavastha he jiske antargat prayek rajya main yah vishwaas banaaye rakhane kaa satat praytn kiya jaataa he ki yadi rajya akraman kaa praytn karte hai to unhen ajey duusare rashtron ke samooh kaa pratirodh karnaa hoga
 The balance of power refers to a just system of power between members of the nation's families that prevents a nation from becoming so powerful that it does not impose its will on another nation
 is prakaar shakti santulan ko vidwaanon ne vibhinn dashshtiyon se dekha he
 Some see it as a distribution of power, some as an equilibrium between groups, some as stability, some as war and instability
 kehane kaa arth yah he ki in paribhaashaon main sarvasammati kaa abhaav he
 This is probably because there are many meanings / uses of balance of power, due to which this confusion has remained
 mukhya taur par shakti santulan ko chaar sandarbhon main prayog kiya jaataa he- According to Quincy Right, the principle of balance of power is based on five beliefs- shakti santulan kii nimnlikhit visheshtaayen hoti hai- In general it is a policy to maintain status quo, but in reality it is always dynamic and variable
 yah koi daivi vardaan nahin he, apitu yah maanav ke satat hastkshep kaa parinaam he
 It is defined both subjectively and objectively
 itihaaskaar hameshaa iskaa vastunishth akalan karte hai jabaki rajanyik hameshaa isaki vyaktiparak vivechna karte hai
 Although it is a mechanism for establishing peace, it rarely establishes peace
 yah mukhyatya mahashaktiyon kaa khel he
 Small nations only play the role of spectator
 iske sahi sanchaalan hetu ek sanchaalak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo aaj ke yug main nadaarad he
 It gives equal distribution of powers on the basis of equilibrium
 parantu yah antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke itihaas ko dekhne se gyaat hota he ki aisa samay kabhi nahin rahaa
 The system of balance of power is hardly visible in international politics, because it is not possible to measure and stabilize the power factor
 www
ncert
com The following methods are used to establish the balance of power- kabhi-kabhi badi shaktiyaan chote rajyon kii bhoomi ko aapasi shakti santulan hetu baant leti hai
 This boundary change is done on the basis that none of the mutual powers become stronger than the other
 udhaaharan ke rup main, utract kii sandhi ke baad 1713 main spain kii bhoomi ko borbon va hepsburg ke bich baant diya gaya
 Similarly, Poland was divided into three times in such a way that the balance of power did not deteriorate
 isi prakaar 18veen va 19veen shatabdi main vibhinn sandhiyaan isi dashshtikon ko dhyaan main rakhkar huin
 Friendship treaties have also been a major means of balancing power
 lekin jab ek raashtra maitra sandhiyon ke dwaara apni shakti badha letaa he tab anya rajya bhi ashankit hokar aapas main prati maitra sandhiyaan karne lagate hai
 The end of this sequence is organized by all the nations of the world into opposing groups
 is prakaar kii maitra sandhiyon evam prati maitra sandhiyon kaa daur europe kii raajnneeti main aamtaur par dekhne ko milti he
 For example, in opposition to the formation of the 1882 Triennial Treaty, anti-trinitarian friendship treaties were also agreed among other nations to balance the politics of Europe
 isi prakaar ke udhaaharan dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad mahashaktiyon ke bich sthapit gathbandhanon ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Armament is the direct and foremost form of power
 isiilie rajyon ke madhya, visheshkar apane pratidwandvi se, shastron ko sanchay karne kii hode lag jaati he
 This accumulation develops their military power and serves to increase the pressure on their opponents
 parantu doosraa raashtra yaa rajyon kaa samooh bhi peeche nahin rahanaa chahta, atah donon hi ek duusare ko santulit karnaa chaahate hai
 For example, in the Cold War era, between the former Soviet Union and the United States, armament has been a means of both of them balancing each other
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti shastreekaran ke saath-saath nirastrikaran bhi kai baar shaktiyon ke madhya santulan banane kaa kaary karata he
 When the weaponization is not possible to proceed after a climax, then the powers move towards disarmament
 udhaaharan ke rup main, donon mahashaktiyon ke bich salt-1 salt-2 start-1 va start-2 ienef sandhi aadi samjhaute iskaa pramaan he
 This is evidence of the need to take measures to increase credibility in the present times, fed up with arms, among other nations
 kai baar do shaktiyaan aapasi sidhe takaraav ko taalkar kisi ek rajya ko madhya rakhkar aapasi santulan banaae rakhti hai
 Therefore, such a weak and neutral state always keeps the balance of power along with the possibility of war between the two big forces
 udhaaharan rup main, kaaphi samay tak poland rus va germany ke bich madhyavarti rajya bana rahaa
 This situation was prolonged between Afghanistan, Russia and England
 kabhi-kabhi do gaiyr mitra raashtra madhyavarti kshetra ko baraabar-baraabar baant lete hai
 In such a situation the effect of intermediate regions is minimized
 udhaaharan ke rup main germany, korea, hind-china kaa vibhaajan
 Current International Politics These areas are almost finished
 atah inkaa prabhaav bhi shakti santulan hetu naganya ho gaya he
 The policy of intervention is always to increase its influence by powerful nations interfering in the matter of another
 iskaa uddeshy bade raashtra dwaara vahaan par kisi shashan ke bane rahane yaa badalane ke swaroop main hota he
 Through this means, an effort is made to maintain the balance of power
 shityudh kaal main donon mahashaktiyon ne iskaa khub prayog kiya
 While the former Soviet Union intervened in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, the US has intervened in Grenada, Cuba, Nicaragua, Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc
 ahastkshep dwaara santulan banaae rakhane kii niti aamtaur par chote rashtron dwaara apanaai gai he
 It has been adopted as a coastal state by smaller states
 kuch paristhitiyon main bade raashton ne bhi iskaa sahaara liya he
 Most of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin American countries have followed the policy of non-alignment by adopting a policy of non-alignment
 isse yuddh na karne yaa use simit rakhane yaa uske sthaneey swaroop dene kaa prayaas aadi isi ke antargat aa jate hai
 Divide by big forces in international politics, has also followed the policy of rule
 rajyon ko do virdohi guton main baant kar bhi shaktiyaan us kshetra main shakti santulan sthapit karti hai
 This policy was used quite often by Britain to keep its empire unified
 1947 kaa bharat-paak vibhaajan iskaa shashakt udhaaharan he
 Under this policy, efforts have been made to balance by weakening our rivals
 shityudh kaal main mahashaktiyon ne bhi gutnirpeksh deshon main is prakaar kii niti kaa anusaran kiya he
 If we evaluate the balance of power, then it becomes clear that in this way the absolute limits on power could not be imposed
 haa kuch had tak yah siddhanth apane uddeshyon main safal ho sakaa
 The following reasons for this theory not being able to completely curb the development of power - uparokt vichaaron se yah spasht he ki shakti vistaar yaa shakti sangharsh rokane hetu yah siddhanth purnroopen sakasham nahin he
 But it does get partial success through this, because - First, small states can assure their security
 dwitiya, yah kisi badi shakti ke aadhipaty sthapana par bhi ankush rakhega
 Third, it is also capable of avoiding wars
 chaturth, samprabhu rajyon par kisi kendriya satta ke abhaav main antarrashtriya kanoon bhi keval shakti santulan se hi sambhav he
 Therefore, it is able to partially block the possibilities of establishing autocratic or hegemonic power

 They should be treated by a special doctor so that no bad, embossed mark remains
 iske atirikt kuch manushyon kii twachaa sukhi or machhlee kii twachaa kii bhanti hoti he
 It stays like this throughout the birth
 aise vyakti ko sabun kaa prayog nahin karnaa chahie
 Some humans have a clean white of the skin, hair and eyes
 aise vyakti ko surajamukhi, athwa varnheen, kehete hai
 Sun rays are extremely harmful for them, so they should always be protected from sunlight and "sunglasses" should be used while venturing out in the sun

 jin kapadon ko pahan kar ve rasayanakon kaa prayog karte hai, unhen kaam ke pashchaat turant badal lenaa chahie, jisase sharir par un padaarthon kaa bura prabhaav adhik der tak na padataa rahe
