 Therefore, according to him, the aim of economics should not be to consider human welfare but only to believe in world welfare
 arthshaastra kii vishay saamagree ke sambandh main aarthik kriyaaon kaa varnan bhi jaruri he
 Earlier, production, consumption, exchange and distribution were considered as the four major parts of economics
 aadhunik arthshaastra main in kriyaaon ko paanch bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he
 On the basis of the purpose of economic activities, in 1933, Regner Frisch first divided economics into two parts
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, videshi vinium, banking aadi samshti arthshaastra ke rup hai
 In short, from the point of view of study, we can put different parts of economics in this way: yah vaiyaktik ikaayiyon kaa adhyayan karata he, jaise vyakti, parivaar, form, udyog, vishesh vastu kaa mulya
 According to Bolding, microeconomics is the study of special firms, special families, individual prices, workers, incomes, individual industries, and specialty goods
 yah seemaant vishleshan ko mahatv detaa he
 Many important topics of modern economic theory such as international trade, foreign exchange, revenue, banking, business cycle, national income and employment theory, economic planning and economic development etc
 are studied under it
 boldig ke shabdon main, samshti arthshaastra, arthshaastra kaa vah bhaag he jo arthshaastra ke bade samoohon or ausaton kaa adhyayan karata he, na ki uski vishesh madon kaa
 He tries to define these groups in a useful way and examines their mutual relations

 Modern economists after Cannes now discuss various parts of economics by some new names, such as economics of capital, capital formation, labor economics, economics of traffic, monetary economics, canyon economics, economics of underdeveloped countries, economics of development , Comparative economics, international economics etc
 aadhunaki kaal main desh videsh main arthshaastra vishay kii snatakottar shiksha bhi inhen naamon ke prashnpatron ke anusaar di jaati he
 Economic system) is a system under which people earn their livelihood by working in various occupations
 aarthik kriyaaon ko sucharu rup se sanchalit karne ke liye prayek desh alag-alag aarthik pranali apanaataa hai
 Economic systems are mainly divided into three parts
 aadhunik arthik praniliyon main samaajwaad tathaa poonjeevaad kaa sarvaadhik ullekh ho rahaa he
 Every country, whether it works under any economic system, has to face various economic problems like poverty, inequality of wealth and income, unemployment, inflation and recession
 in samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye vah vibhinn nitiyon ko apanaataa he
 The main economic policies are as follows
 bharat kii arthshaastra ko jaanane, samajhane or prayog main laane kii apni vishesh panrapara rahi he
 It is a matter of sorrow that the major works of ancient and new Indian economists have not yet been properly evaluated and our students have been studying only Western economists and their theories
 pracheen kaal ke aarthik vichaaron ko ham vedon, upanishdon, mahakavyon, dharamshastron, grihmasutron, naarad, shukr, vidura ke nitigranthon or sarvaadhik rup se kautilya ke arthshaastra se praapt karte hai
 Among the main Indian economists in modern India - mahatma gandhi dwaara pranit tathaa acharya vinoba bhaave dwaara prayog main laai gai arthshaastra kii yah vichaardhaara ati aadhunik he or bharatiyon kii vishisht dein he
 Under this, there are ideas like Gramswarajya, Swavalamban, use of coexistence and non-violent revolution, which, in Jayaprakash Narayan's words, can bring economic revolution anytime anywhere in the world, not only in India
 inkaa prayog nai shiksha ke saath saath bharat main ho rahaa he
 Modern economics is tied up in more than half of mathematical models, practices, equations and formulas
 purv main sankhyikee kaa prayog arthshaastri aichhik rup se karte the parantu ab vah arthshaastra ke hetu anivaary ho gaya he
 Apart from this, econometrics is also being developed in full in development
 pravagic rup main 'in-put out-put vishleshan' se lekar arthshaastra ne 'game theory' tathaa 'technical flo' tak nikaal daalaa he
 All economists are using mathematical tools to clarify economic principles
 lenior programing' tathaa 'vibhedikikaran prakriya' ke antargat arthshaastri ganitiya drishy prabhaavon ke saath-saath adrishy aarthik prabhaavon ko bhi dikhaane kaa praytn kar rahe hai
 From the small machine of calculation to the largest computer, economists have practical forms of mathematical progress
 sambhavat: agle do teen dashak tak aisi vidhiyaan avishkrut ho jaayengi jinase ganitiya vidhiyon dwaara ati sankshep main keval nishkarsh praapt honge tathaa prakriya kaa koi bhi talmail baithaana aavashyak na hoga
 Nowadays economists are relying most on mathematical economics method
 vyaavhaarik arthshaastra garib evam sadhanrahit deshon kii vyaavhaarik samasyaon ko sulajhaa rahaa he
 The Asian drama by Gunar Cridal is perhaps the largest economical treatise published after Marx's slave capital, which solved the problems of underdeveloped countries

 Under this, current international problems such as planning, capital formation and foreign aid are studied
 arthshaastra kaa mahatv badi teevr gati se badhata ja rahaa he
 According to the United Nations Affake Report, E
, about 1,000 texts or articles on economics are being published every hour in the world
 raajnneeti ke baad lokapriyata main arthshaastra kaa hi sthaan hai
 In fact, economics has to be used for welfare, otherwise one day it will drown everyone by aiming to raise material resources
 santosh kii baat he ki ab arthshaastri is baat ko samajhane lage hai
 The ancient philosophy of India knows from the beginning that mere multiplicity of material means cannot make a person happy
 pro shumpiter ne apane naveenatam lekh arthshaastra kaa bhavishya main sweekaar kiya he ki siddhant rup se aarthik vishleshan chaahe jitani pragati kar le, vyavhaar main use hameshaa shanti, sukh evam kalyaan ke hetu hi kaary karnaa hoga
 If economics can work for the welfare of all human beings, then its future will be bright
 isi kaaran ab arthshaastra par nobel puraskaar bhi diya jane laga he

 Police & capf ghirani ek gol rambh he, jisase mashin kii shakti ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak le jaaya jaataa he
 If a lathe is to be run from the engine, then by putting a strap on the engine pulley and the lathe pulley, you run the lathe with the power of the engine
 ghirani ke vyas se hi mashiinon kii gati ko kam yaa zyada kiya ja saktaa he
 The power of machines can be moved from one place to another without any loss of teeth, but where there is more distance in these places, these cycles cannot be used
 inhen sthanon par ghiraniyon kaa upyog hota he
 They are given power from one thread to the other by offering leather straps or ropes
 ghirani keval bal kii disha main parivartan karti he, bal ke pariman main nahin
 
 yadi ingine se kisi duusari mashin ko chalaaya ja rahaa he, to ingine kii ghirani chalaanevaali ghirani kehalaaegi or mashin kii ghirani chalanevaali ghirani hogi
 The pulleys are usually of cast iron, the middle part of which is joined by the arms of the pulley
 ye baaju sankhya main chaar se lekar chha: tak hote hai
 The spindle is tightened by inserting it into the hole in the middle part of the pulley
 ghirani ke har bhaag kii naap aisi rakhi jaati he ki vah usapar padanevaale har bal ko sahan kar sake
 The recent width of the pulley is kept slightly higher than the width of the leash
 iske haal par do prakar ke bal honge, ek to patte ke khinchaav ke kaaran or doosraa iske ghoomane ke kaaran
 It has been observed that the speed of a recent pulley of a square inch passage should exceed 100 feet per second
 isaliye dhalwaan lohe kii ghirani ko is gati se adhik tej nahin chalaaya jaataa
 Where more speed is required, a pulley is made by mixing raw and cast iron
 iskaa dhyaan rahe ki adhik gati se chalanevaali ghiraniyon ko dhaala nahin jaataa, balki iske vibhinn bhaagon ko alag banaakar pechon dwaara joda jaataa he
 The weight of this type of pulley is often not too much and there is not much fear of breaking it
 ghirani banane main iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki uskaa aakarshanakendra thik bich main ho
 If this is not done, it will cause oscillation as the axle rotates and the axle will be weighed
 isaliye ghirani ko dhuree par chadhaakar iskaa tolan jaanch liya jaataa he
 To check this, the spindle is placed at the bases from both sides
 yadi dhuree har sthaan par rukii rahe or ghume nahin, to iskaa tolan thik hoga or agar yah kisi ore gum jaay to isse pataa chalegaa ki ghirani ek ore se baari he
 The weight is corrected by tying the same weight on the other side of which the pulley is heavy
 bhinn bhinn prakaar kii ghiraniyon kaa vivaran neeche diya ja rahaa he: This pulley is made by mixing two or more pulleys of different diameters
 pad ghirani ko ek hi bhaag main dhaala jaataa he
 They are used in the same place where both the running and running pulleys and the speed of the moving machine need to be changed
 in ghiraniyon ko is prakaar lagaaya jaataa he ki ek ghirani kii choti ghirani duusare kii badi ghirani ke saamne ho
 This does not make any difference in the length of the lease by changing the lease from one post to another, so the length of the lease is taken after taking the diameters of both the houses before mounting it on the pulley
 ghirani par jo patta chadhaaya jaataa he, usase chalanevaali mashin kii disha bhi badali jaati he
 If both sides of the lease are parallel to it, the direction of rotation of the pulley rod will be the same as that of the pulley pulley
 agar is disha ko badalanaa he, to patte ke baajuon ko ek duusare par chadhaakar ghirani par chadhaaya jaataa he
 This pulley is usually small in size and is used to maintain the tension of the lease properly
 isaki dhuree par ek skanda lagaakar patte par chhod diya jaataa he or skanda ke bal ke kaaran yah ghirani patte kaa dabaae rakhti he
 If the tension of the leash decreases while walking, then due to the pressure of the skand the rider encircles the leash, which does not reduce the stress
 isaliye savaar ghirani lagbhag har patte par lagaai jaati he
 These two pulleys are placed on the axles running close together and they both have equal diameter
 inamen pehali ghirani dhuree par kasi hui hoti he or mashiinon ke chalaane ke kaam aati he
 The second loose pulley is neither rotated by the rotation of the spindle nor does the spindle rotate due to its rotation
 dhili ghirani lagane kaa matlab keval yah hota he ki jab chalanevaali ghirani se patte ko dhili ghirani par laayaa jaataa he to dhuree to gumti rahati he, magar kasi hui chalanevaali mashin ruk jaati he
 Therefore, the machine which is running from this axis can be stopped without stopping
 jab is mashin ko phir chalaanaa ho to patte ko sthir ghirani par le aayaa jaataa he
 These pulleys are shaped like v and are used where ropes are used to carry power
 kuch sthanon par shakti itani zyada hoti he ki use chamade ke patton se nahin le jaaya ja saktaa
 Therefore many ropes are mixed and mounted on such pulleys
 ye rasse soot ke bhi hote hai or lohe ke taron ke bhi
 Another advantage of these ropes is that while walking, they do not slip on the pulleys as much as the leather strap slips
 isse shakti kii haani nahin hoti
 If the moving axles are not parallel, the strap will slip from the pulleys
 isko rokane ke liye maarg ghirani kaa upyog hota he
 This pulley is placed in such a way that the axle of the drive pulley and the drive pulley are in a plane and the axis of the pulley pulley and pulley pulley are in a plane
 isse ghiraniyon par chadha hua patta nahin utrega

 jis samay bharat main bhagwaan mahavir or buddha dharm ke sambadh main nae vichaar rakh rahen the, china main bhi ek sudhaarak kaa janm hua, jiskaa naam kanceyushious tha
 At that time, the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou Dynasty was going on in China
 samay ke saath jhou rajvansh kii shakti shithil padane ke kaaran china main bahut se rajya kaayam ho gayi, jo sadaa aapas main ladate rahete the, jise jhagadate rajyon kaa kaal kaha jane laga
 Therefore, the people of China were suffering a lot
 aise samay main china vaasiyon ko naitikta kaa paath padhaane hetu mahatma kanceyucious kaa aavirbhaav hua
 He was born in Shandong region of China, about 550 years before the birth of Jesus Christ
 bachapan main hi unke pita kii mrityu ho gai
 The aspiration for his knowledge was limitless
 bahut adhik ksht karke unhen gyaan arjan karnaa padaa tha
 At the age of 17, he got a government job
 kuch hi varshon ke baad sarkari naukari chhodkar ve shikshan kaary main lag gayi
 He started giving education to students by opening a school at home
 ve maukhik rup se vidhyaarthiyon ko itihaas, kavy or nitishastra kii shiksha dete the
 He wrote several books on poetry, history, music and ethics
 53 varsh kii umr main lu rajya main ek shahar ke ve shashankarta tathaa baad main ve mantri pad par niyukt hue
 As a minister, he emphasized on the improvement of human character in lieu of punishment
 kanceyucious ne apane shishyon ko satya, prem or nyaay kaa sandesh diya
 He used to put more emphasis on virtue
 ve logon ko vinayi, paropkaaree, guni or charitravaan banane kii prerana dete the
 ve bado env purvajon ko aadar-sammaan karne ke liye kehete the
 ve kehete the ki dusron ke saath vaisaa vartav na karo jaisaa tum swany apane saath nahin karnaa chaahate ho
 Confucius was a reformer, not a preacher
 unhone ishwar ke bare main koi upadesh nahin diya, parantu phir bhi baad main log unhen dharmik guru maanane lage
 He died in 480 BC i was done kanceyucious ke samaaj sudhaarak upadeshon ke kaaran chini samaaj main ek sthirataa aayi
 Confucius's philosophy remains a pioneer for Chinese education even today
 kanfushas ne kabhi bhi apane vichaaron ko likhit rup dena aavashyak nahin samajha
 He believed that he could be the bearer of ideas, not his creator
 vah puraatatv kaa upaask tha, kayonki uskaa vichaar tha ki usee ke madhyam se yatharth gyaan praapt praapt ho saktaa he
 He said that man can get rules for all his activities within himself
 na keval vyakti ke liye varan sampurna samaaj ke sudhaar or sahi vikaas ke niyam or swaroop pracheen mahatmaon ke shabdon evam kaarysheleyon main praapt ho sakate hai
 Confucius did not leave an article that represented the principles of moral and social order propounded by him
 kintu uske pautra tje sje dwaara likhit 'ausat kaa siddhant' or uske shishy tsong sin dwaara likhit 'mahan shiksha' naamak pustakon main tatsambandhi samast suchnaayen praapt hoti hai
 a treatise called 'spring and Autumn', which is also called the chronicle of Lu, is said to be written by Confucius
 yah samoochee kriti praapt he or yadhyapi bahut choti he tathaapi china ke sankshipt itihaason ke liye adarsh maani jaati he
 Overall, the number of Confucius disciples had reached 3,000, but nearly 75 of them were highly talented scholars
 uske param priy shishy uske paas hi rahaa karte the
 They used to rise and sit around him reverently and pay attention to the subtle features of his conduct and he would meditate and meditate on every word of speech coming out of his mouth
 ve usase pracheen itihaas, kavy tathaa desh kii samjik prathaon kaa adhyayan karte the
 Confucius said that good governance and peace can be established in a country only when the ruler, minister and every person of the public continue to perform the proper duties in their place
 shaasha ko sahi artho main shaasha hona chahie, mantri ko sahi artho main mantri hona chahie
 The Confucius was once asked that if he was given the responsibility of running the governorship of a state, then he would do the first important work
 iske liye uskaa uttar tha– 'naamon main sudhaar'
 This meant that the name of the post on which he is eminent should duly perform all the duties attached to the post so that his name is meaningful
 use udhaaharan or adarsh kii shakti main purna vishwaas tha
 He believed that the common people certainly bow down to the examples which the ideal person presents with his good conduct
 yadi kisi desh ke shaasha ko iskaa bhalee bhanti gyaan kara diya jaae ki use shashan kaary chalaane main kya karnaa chahie or kis prakaar karnaa chahie to nishchay hi vah apana udhaaharan prastut karke aam janata ke aacharan main sudhaar kar saktaa he or apane rajya ko sukhi, samrudh evam sampann bana saktaa he
 On the basis of this belief, the Confucius declared that if a ruler made him his chief counselor for 12 months, he could show a lot and if he was given three years, he could embody his ideals and hopes
 Can provide
 kanfushas ne kabhi is baat kaa daawa nahin kiya ki use koi daivi shakti yaa ishwariya sandesh praapt hote the
 He used to think only about what is a person and what are his duties in society
 usne shaktipradarshan, asaadhaaran evam ammanushik shaktiyon, vidroh pravriti tathaa devi devataaon kaa zikr kabhi nahin kiya
 His statement was that it is a matter of intelligence that every person should perform his duty with full accountability and honesty and keep separate from them even while honoring the Gods and Goddesses
 uskaa mat tha ki jo manushya maanav kii seva nahin kar saktaa vah devi devataaon kii seva kya karegaa
 He had full attention for all duties of himself and others, which is why he said that a bad man can never be able to rule, no matter how powerful he is
 niyamon kaa ulanghan karanevaalon ko to shaasha dand detaa hi he, parantu use kabhi yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki uske sadacharan ke adarsh prastut karne kii shakti se badhkar anya koi shakti nahin he
 The philosophy based on philosophical, social and political views of Confucianism is called Confucianism or Kungphutism

 Historically, critics have differed on this, with some critics saying the work is less outstanding than Shakespeare's other works, while some consider the play to be a masterpiece

 The Duke's daughter Rosalind is allowed to live in the palace as she is also a close friend and cousin of Frederick's only child, Celia

 Frederick becomes enraged and kicks Rosalind out of the gathering
 celia or roslind vidooshak tochastone ke saath bhaagane kaa nirnay leti hai, jis dauraan roslind ek yuva purush kaa chhadam vesh dhaaran karti he
 Rosalind, now under the guise of Ganymede and Celia who is disguised as Alienna, arrives in the wilderness of the Arcadian Arden, where the exiled, duke lives with some of his supporters, these supporters include "sad Jax" Whose introduction we get when he weeps at the slaughter of a deer

 Orlando and his servant Edams, meanwhile, meet and live with the Duke and his comrades, and unilaterally abandon the trees for Rosslind
 roslind ko bhi orlando se prem he or vah usase genimad ke rup main milti he or use prem rog se bachaane ke liye paraamarsh dene kaa dhong karti he
 Ganymede states that "he" will replace "rosslind" and that "he" and Orlando will play their relationship dramatically
 is bich, gadarin febe, jisase silvius prem karata he, genimad se prem karne lagati he, jabaki "genimad" vastav main yah zaahir karata he ki use febe main koi dilchaspee nahin he
 Blasphemous Touchstone also takes a prolific initiative towards Audrey, a goof-minded goat-grazing girl, and attempts to marry her, but her plan is thwarted by Jax, who is already improperly interfered with
 ant main, silvius, febe, genimad or orlando is bahes main ulajh jate hai ki koun kise praapt karegaa
 Ganymede says that he will solve the problem, he promises Orlando and Phebe that if Phebe is not able to marry Ganymede they will marry Rosalind and Silvius respectively
 The next day, Ganymede reveals himself as Rosalind, and as Phebe's love proves to be wrong, she has to adopt Silvius

 arden sambhawatah shakespeare ke shahar stretford-apon-evan ke paas ke ek jangal kaa sthaan-naam he
 The Shakespearean version of Oxford arguably explains this geographical anomaly, assuming that 'arden' is simply the Englishization of Ardennes, the forested region of France, and its lettering was altered to reflect it
 anya sanskaran shakespeare ke 'arden' vartanee ko hi maan kar chalaten hai, taaki yah tark diya ja sake ki gramin style ek vilakshan duniya ko chitrit karti he jahaan bhugolic vivaran apraasangik hote hai
 The Arden edition of Shakespeare suggests that the name 'arden' originated from a combination of the traditional field of Arcadia and the Bible's Garden of Eden, as the play has a strong mutual influence of traditional and Christian beliefs

 The detailed gender inversion in the story is particularly interesting to modern critics interested in gender studies

 In fact, in the epilogue that Rosalind tells the audience, it clearly appears that she is not a woman

 The play As You Like It by William Shakespeare clearly falls under a rural romance genre; But Shakespeare not only used style, but also developed them

 In traditional settings the family character was a familiar theme to Shakespeare and his audience; It is only the spot response and the generality of the subject that imparts intelligence to the text, which imparts a fresh stamp on the proceedings
 naatak ke centre main roslind kii ashaavadita kii tulana jacks ke stri virodhatmak shok ke saath kii gai he
 Shakespeare later took some of the themes more seriously: the unjust duke and the exiled duke provided the subject matter for Meshr and Tempest

 mahadwipiya visthaapan prithvi ke mahadwipon ke ek-duusare ke sambandh main hilne ko kehete hai
 If seen in geographical epochs of millions of years, then it seems that the continents and their parts are sitting on the sea floor and flowing in some direction
 mahadwipon ke bahane kii avadharana sabase pehle 1596 main dach vaigyanik abraham ortalius ne prakat kii thi lekin 1912 main german bhuvaigyanik alfred vegener ne swatantra adhyayan se iskaa viksit rup prastut kiya
 Later, the theory of plate tectonics developed which enabled the movement of continents to be better understood than continental flow
 abraham ortalius, theodor christoff liliyenthal, alexander won hambolt, antonio snidar-pelegrini tathaa anya ne pehle hi yah dhyaan diya tha ki atlantic mahaasaagar ke donon vipareet chor ke mahadwipon ke aakaar ek duusare main thik-thik baithte hai

 kius ne ortalius ke vichaar ko is prakaar varnit kiya: Alfred Wegener hypothesized in 1912 that they were a unified landmass before continents crumbled
 vegener kaa siddhant swatantra rup se bana tha va apane purvavartiyon kii tulana main adhik utkrisht tha, baad main vegener ne kuch puraane lekhakon ko milte julate vichaaron kaa shrey diya:franklin coxwardi ,roberto mantovani, wiliam henry pickring or frank barsle tailor 
 For example: From the geological similarities of the southern continents, Roberto Mantovani hypothesized in 1889 and 1909 that all the continents had previously coalesced into one very large continent; Wegener found similarities in his maps of the southern continents of Mantovani
 The continent broke up due to the thermal expansion caused by volcanic activities and new continents began to flow away from each other, as the rift areas, which now have oceans, also continued to grow
 isi vajah se mantovani ne vistaarsheel prithvi kaa siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya, jo tab se galat dikhaayi padataa he
 Frank Bursley Taylor proposed the continental flow without expansion, suggesting in 1908 that the continent was pulled to the equator by the moon's gravitational force during the Khamtimya, which is why the Himalayas and the Alps were formed to the south
 Wegener stated that all these theories closely resemble his own theory, although Taylor's theory is not fully developed
 vegener "mahadwipiya pravaah" shabd kaa prayog karne vaale pratham vyakti the evam yah pariklpana aupchaarik rup se prakashit hui ki mahadweep kisi prakaar se "pravaahit" hokar dur chale gaye
 Although they gave sufficient evidence for continental flow, they could not give a reliable explanation of the physical process that led to this flow
 unka yah suzav, ki mahadweep us apkendriya chhadam-bal ke kaaran khinch gaye jo ki prithvi ke ghurnan athwa khagolic aynansh ke kaaran utpann hua, asweekaar kar diya gaya kyonki gananaaon se yah siddh hua ki yah bal iske liye paryaapt nahin tha
 The Paulfleukt hypothesis was studied by Paul Sophus Eptstein in 1920 and found to be unreliable
 mahadwipiya pravaah ke ab vyapak sakshya hai
 Fossils of plants and animals found on the coasts of different continents seem to have been linked once

 There is also some living evidence - some similar animals are found on both these continents
 udhaaharan ke liye kuch kentuon ke kuch parivaar / prajatiyaan africa or dakshin america main paae jate hai
 The complementary arrangement of the front portions of South America and Africa is clear, but it is a temporary coincidence
 lakhon varshon main slab khinchaav va rij dabaav tathaa tectonophizix kii anya shaktiyaan in mahadwipon ko ek dusre se or adhik dur le jaayengi tathaa ghumaayengi
 in asthaayee visheshtaon ne vegener ko iskaa adhyayan karne ko prerit kiya jise unhone mahadwipiya pravaah naam se paribhaashit kiya, yadhyapi ve apni pariklpana ko logon dwaara sweekaar kiye jane tak jivit nahin rahe
 The large distribution of permo-carboniferous glacial sediments in South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica, and Australia is a major evidence of the flow of continents
 oriented himand shrinkhalaa tathaa tilites namak jamaav se bane satat himand ek bahut bade mahadweep gondvanaa ke astitv kii pushti karte hai jise mahadwipiya pravaah ke siddhant kaa kendriya tatva mana jaataa he
 These ranges show glacial drift in modern coordinates, moving away from the equator and moving toward the poles, as well as showing that the southern continents were in dramatically different places in the past and were connected to each other
 haalanki ab yah mana jane laga he ki prithvi kii sataha par mahadweep gatisheel rahete hai - yadhyapi unki gati disha nirdeshit hoti he naa ki ve dishaheen rup se chalan karte hai - phir bhi saidhantik rup se is pravaah ko kai varshon tak sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 One problem was that no reliable driving force was shown
 saath hi vegener kaa bhugarbha vaigyanik nahin hona bhi ek samasya thi
 In 1953, five years before Carrey introduced the plate tectonic theory - the theory of continental flow was rejected by physicist Schidiger on the following grounds
 yah ab gyaat he ki prithvi par do prakaar kii crust hoti hai, mahadwipiya crust va mahasagariya crust, jahaan pehali vaali ek bhinn sanrachana vaali tathaa mularoop se halki hoti he, donon hi prakaar kii crust ek kahin gahare draveekrut aavaran par sthit hoti hai
 In addition, oceanic crusts are still forming at the spreading centers, and this, along with subduction, drives the system of plates chaoticly resulting in continuous orogeny and isostatic imbalance
 plate tectonix ke dwaara in sab tathaa mahadwipon kii gati ko kahin behatar rup se spasht kiya ja saktaa he

 False indication The process of developing a computer program starts with understanding the work being done and the reasoning for completion of the work and this is done with the help of a flow table or false signal
 mithyaa sanket pravaah talika kaa ek viksit vikalp he
 The process of the program is written in sequence rather than various figures or symbols in false signs
 chunki iskaa program ko dizin karne me mahatvapurn sthaan he at: ise program dizin bhashaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 The following basic arguments are used as a format for writing programs by false indication - 1 sequence logic: - In a computer program, various statements are written in a certain order
 jab program ko chalaaya jaataa he to vibhinn statement me di gai cmand evam nirdeshaanusaar usee kram me kriyanvit hota he
 Using sequence logic, instructions are written in the program in order to work
 at: anukram tark ke liye mithyaa sanket usee kram me likhe jane chaiye jis kram me unka prayog kiya janaa he
 Fulfill statement in false sign ';' That is, denoted by a semicolon
 yun to ardhviram kaa prayog karte hue ek line me ek se adhik statement bhi likhe ja sakate he parantu uchit yahi rahata he ki ek line me ek hi statement likhaa jaae taaki program ko samajhane me saralata ho
 2
selection Logic - Since this argument is used for decision making, it is also called decision reasoning
 iskaa prayog mithyaa sanket me vahaan kiya jaataa he jahaan ek se adhik vaikalpik patho me se sahi path chunanaa hota he
 It is used in four formats
 ek pathiya praaroop – yah IF se prarambh hota he or ENDIF par samaapt hota he
 THEN is used after IF and it is implemented only when the given condition is correct
 dwi pathiya praaroop- isame IF aurathhand ke saath ELSE kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he
 The THAN condition is used for the first option and the ELSE condition for the second option
 bahupathiy praaroop -is praaroop kaa prayog us sthiti me kiya jaataa he jabaki shart ke do se adhik vikalp ko jachana hota he jabaki iname se keval hi satya hota he
 Position format - It is used in place of a unique decision
 sharan sthiti praaroop-jab kisi shart me koi anya up shart bhi sammilit ho to sharan sthiti praaroop prayog kiya jaataa he
 3
 Frequency Logic - This is used to perform a loop
 jab ek athwa adhik nirdesho kaa kriyaanvayan kisi shart ke aadhaar par ek se adhik baar hona hota he to is sthiti ko loop kaha jaataa he
 Three types of loop formats are used in the program - do-while loop format - WHILE is used initially in this format and condition is also written
 iske baad DO kaa prayog kiya jaataa he tathaa iske saath vah nirdesh hota he jiskaa anupaalan di gai shart ke puraa hone par kiya jaataa he
 Finally ENDDO indicates the end of this format
 ripet antil praaroop-is praaroop kaa prarambh REPEAT se hota he or UNTIL par samaapan hota he
 The instructions given between REPEAT and UNTIL continue to be followed repeatedly until the condition given to UNTIL is fulfilled
 for xxrep 4 
 next loop praaroop-is prakaar ke praaroop me aavruti kii sankhya nishchit hoti he tathaa pehle se hi gyaat hoti he
 START pravaah talika athwa anya kisi saadhan se mithyaa sanket se program ko programing bhashaa me koding karnaa apekshaakrit adhik suvidhajanak hota he
 It is very convenient to make any improvement in the program by designing the program in false indication as compared to the flow table
 pravaah talika ko ansi paristhiti me dubaara hi bananaa pasta he
 It can be easily read and explained
 ise likhane me kam samay or shram lagata he
 False signals do not underline the design of the program
 mithyaa sanket me program ko dizin karne ke vishesh niyam nahi hote inkaa maanakeekaran nahi hone ke kaaran vibhinn programmer apni suvidhanusaar hi iskaa prayog karte he

 Starting with the receiver's electronics, they moved to the technologically latest and far-reaching astronomical study of polarization of radio waves
 isamen brihaspati ke aasapaas vaan ellen jaise belton se radio tarangon kaa pataa lagaana or brihaspati ke kor kii sahi roteshan kaa pehla nirdhaaran shaamil hai
 He was also the first to conduct a gradual application of interferometry to polarized luminosity, distribution of luminosity, and an early study of the Géman effect in a 21 cm line emitted by a hydrogen atom

 The period of his stay in Australia also marked his leadership in a comprehensive survey of the absorption and emission of 21 cm line radiation by neutral hydrogen which later helped to develop realistic models of the interstellar medium
 He has also conducted a gradual interferometric study of 21 cm absorption towards a large number of galactic and extragalactic sources

 According to his colleagues at various international institutions, all eras are known for their contributions to the field of astronomy and astrophysics, although Prof
 Radhakrishnan is credited with many important discoveries, his main influence on astronomy being attributed to others
 The research has influenced the discussion of astronomical and technical problems and the practical cooperation of the people

 It is noteworthy that Prof
 Radhakrishnan's style of working on science has given him an important place in the astronomical community

 The scientific life of Professor Radhakrishnan is an example of the spirit of this statement
 " "radhakrishnan Nirankhari was extremely short-spoken about his achievements, but does not hold back from quick and generous appreciation of the good works of others

 The oldest available literature of India is Vedic literature
 vaidic kaaleen bhartiya yajna kiya karte the
 In order to get the specific fruits of yagyas, it was necessary to do them at the prescribed time, so from the Vedic period, Indians started getting knowledge of Kaal from the positions of Sun and Moon by the Vedhas
 panchang sudharasmiti kii report main die gaye vivaran ke anusaar rugveda kaal ke aaryon ne chandra saura varshganana paddati kaa gyaan praapt kar liya tha
 They also knew the 12 lunar months and the Adhimas who associated the lunar months with the solar year
 din ko chandramaa ke nakshatra se vyakt karte the
 He had knowledge of the lunar zodiac of the lunar eclipse
 varsh ke dinon kii sankhya 366 thi, jinamein se chandra varsh ke liye 12 din gata dete the
 According to the report, the time of Rigvedic Aryans must be at least 1,200 years BC
 lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilak kii orin ke anusaar yah samay shaq sanwat se lagbhag 4000 varsh pehle thahartaa he
 In the Yajurveda period, the Indians named 12 names of the months Madhu, Madhava, Venus, Shuchi, Namas, Namasya, Ish, Urja, Sahasra, Tapas and Tapasya
 baad main yahi poornima main chandramaa ke nakshatra ke aadhaar par caitra, baishakh, jyeshtha, asadha, bhadrapada, asina, karthik, margshirsh, pus, magh tathaa phalgun ho gaye
 The complete number of constellations and the names of their superordinate deities are also found in the Yajurveda
 yajurveda main tithi tathaa pakshon, uttar tathaa dakshin ayan or vishuv din kii bhi kalpana he
 The equinox day is the day on which the sun stays at the equinox and the revolution
 shri shankar baalkrishna dikshit ke anusaar yajurveda kaalik aaryon ko guru, shukr tathaa rahu ketu kaa gyaan tha
 Scholars differ about the creation of the Yajurveda
 yadi ham paashchaatya pakshpaati, kith kaa mat bhi len to yajurveda kii rachana 600 varsh isa purv ho chuki thi
 After this comes the period of Vedang astrology, which ranges from 1,400 years BC to 400 years BC
 vedang jyotish ke anusaar paanch varshon kaa yug mana gaya he, jisamen 1830 madhya sawan din, 62 chandra maas, 1860 tithiyaan tathaa 67 nakshatra maas hote hai
 The names of the five years of the era are: Samvatsar, Parivatsar, Idavatsar, Anuvatsar and Idvatsar 1 According to this the date and lunar constellation were calculated
 iske anusaar maason ke madhya sawan dinon kii gananaa bhi kii gai he
 The important thing that we find in Vedang jyatish is the imagery of the era, in which medium date is derived by finding the medium speed based on the direct perforation of sun and moon
 aage aanevaale siddhant jyotish ke granthon main isi pranali ko apanaakar madhyam grah nikaale gaye hai
 No astrology calculations are available within Vedang Astrology and Siddhanta Astrology
 kintu is bich ke sahitya main aise pramaan milte hai jinase yah spasht he ki jyotish ke gyaan main vruddhi avashya hoti rahi he, udhaaharan ke liye, mahabharat main kai sthanon par grahon kii sthiti, grahayuti, grahayudh aadi kaa varnan he
 It is so clear that during the time of Mahabharata, Indians were familiar with the planetary perforation and their position
 siddhanth jyotish pranali se likhaa hua pratham paurush granth aryabhat pratham kii aryabhatium he
 Then there is the Siddhantpanchika, edited by Barahamihira, which has a collection of Peetamaha, Vasistha, Romak, Pulish and Suryasiddhanta
 isse yah to pataa chalata he ki barahamihir se purv ye siddhantagranth prachlit the, kintu inke nirmaankaal kaa koi nirdesh nahin he
 In general, Indian astrologers have considered them as inauspicious
 aadhunik vidwaanon ne anumaanon se inke kaalon ko nikaala he or ye paraspar bhinn hai
 It is certain that these Vedangs had become prevalent within the time of astrology and Barahamihira
 iske baad likhe gaye siddhantagranthon main mukhya hai : brahmagupta kaa brahmasiddhant, lall kaa shishydhivriddhid, shripati kaa siddhanthashekhar, bhaskaracharya kaa siddhant shiromani, ganesh kaa grahalaghav tathaa kamalaakar bhatta kaa siddhant-tatv-vivek
 There are two classifications of the texts of Mathematical Astrology: Siddhantha Granth and Karanagranth
 siddhantagranth yugadi athwa kalpadi paddati se tathaa karangranth kisi shaq ke aarambh kii gananaapaddati se likhe gaye hai
 Mathematics is the main propounding subject of astrological texts: enumeration of middle planets, enumeration of apparent planets, problems, country and time, sun and lunar eclipse, planetary, planetary, sunrise, planets of the moon, observance and interpretation of observatories
 puure vrutt kii paridhi 360 maan lee jaati he
 Its 360th part is one part, 60th part of one art, 60th part of art is one Vikala, 60th part of one Vikala is one antiquity
 30 ansh kii ek raashi hoti he
 For calculating the planets, 12 parts of the eclipse in which the Sun appears to be traveling
 in bhaagon ko mesh, vrish aadi raashiyon ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 To tell the position of the planet, from zodiac to zodiac, part, art, and development of the planet are told
 yah grah kaa bhogaansh hota he
 In the Siddhanta texts, the parts and ranges of a circle are divided by 24 parts
 inkaa maan kalatmak rahata he
 The sine of an arc of 90 is the radius of the circle, which is called the radius
 isko nimnlikhit sutara se nikaalte hai : Thus the value of the radius is 3438 art, which is adjacent to the actual value
 chaap kii jya aadhunik pranali kii tarah ardhajya he
 In fact, the present triangular results have been developed on the basis of the Indian system and Aryabhata is considered its inventor
 yadi kinhin do bhinn aakaar ke vritton ke trikoshmetiya maanon kii tulana karnaa apekshit hota he, to vrihad vrutt kii trigya tathaa abhisht vrutt kii nishpatti ke aadhaar par abhisht vrutt kii paridhi anshon main nikaali jaati he
 Thus, although the number of degrees in the new order is only 360 in slow and quick circles, the lower numbers written in theses are only for comparative calculation
 vishuvad vrutt main ek samgati se chalanevaale madhyam surya ke ek udai se duusare udai tak ek madhyam sawan din hota he
 It is similar to 'civil Day' in present-day English
 ek sawan din main 60 ghati; 1 ghati 24 minutes saath pal; 1 pal 24 senked 60 vipal tathaa dhai vipal 1 senkend hote hai
 The period of the Earth's orbit relative to a stationary point of the Sun is called the Solar Year
 yah sthir bindu meshadi he
 By the time of the fifth century of Christ, this point was in the radius and equinox
 ab yah us sthaan se lagbhag 23 pashchim hat gaya he, jise aynansh kehete hai
 Ayāngati is not the same in various texts
 yah lagbhag prati varsh 1 kala maani gai he
 The current microcosm is 50
2 percent
 siddhantagrathon kaa varshmaan 365 dipho 15 ghapoo 31 patto 31 vitho 24 prati vitho he
 This is actually a value of 8
 34
 37 Paladi is more
 itane samay main surya kii gati 8
27" hoti he
 Thus, due to our year old, there is more imagination of unpredictability
 varshon kii gananaa ke liye saura varsh kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For lunar months for the census
 surya or chandramaa jab raashyadi main samaan hote hai tab vah amantkaal tathaa jab 6 raashi ke antar par hote hai tab vah poornimantkaal kehalaata he
 There is a lunar month from one moon to another, but the condition is that the sun must come from one zodiac to another at that time
 jis chandra maas main surya kii sankranti nahin padati vah adhimaas kehalaata he
 In such a year, there are 13 months instead of 12
 isi prakaar yadi kisi chandra maas main do sankrantiyaan pad jaayan to ek maas kaa kshay ho jayega
 In this way, the system is associated with the solar system even when the measurements are moon
 chandra din kii ikai ko tithi kehete hai
 It is equal to the 12th of the difference between the Sun and the Moon
 hamaare dharmik din tithiyon se sambhddha he1 chandramaa jis nakshatra main rahata he use chandra nakshatra kehete hai
 In ancient times, lunar constellations were used in place of war
 kaal ke bade maanon ko vyakt karne ke liye yug pranali apanaai jaati he
 that goes: suryasiddhant main bataae aankadon ke anusaar kaliyug kaa aarambh 17 farvari 3102 itho puchho ko hua tha
 The calculation system of Ego from the era, similar to the days of Julian Day number, can be helpful in calculating past and future dates
 grah kii meshadi ke saapeksh prithvi kii parikrama ko ek bhagan kehete hai
 In the Siddhanta texts, there are fractures between yugas, or kalpagrahs
 yug yaa kalp ke madhya sawan dinon kii sankhya bhi di rahati he
 If the planets are in Ariesadi at the beginning of Yuga or Kalpa, then the middle planet can be removed from the Triassic by knowing the middle day
 bhagan kii paribhaasha ke anusaar budh or shukr kii madhyam gati surya ke samaan hi maani gai he
 His speed is comparable to his actual speed
 ye grah rekhadesh, arthath ujjayini, ke yamyottar ke aate hai, jinhen deshaantar tathaa char sanskaron se apane sthaan ke mayam saryodayasannakaalik banaaya jaataa he
 When the apparent speed of the apparent sun and the moon is at its lowest, the portion of the apparent sun and moon at that time should be considered as the enjoyment of their light
 spasht ravi chandra or madhyam ravi chandra ke antar ko mandafal kehete hai
 Mandnech will be 180 from Mandotch
 mandoch se chah raashi tak spasht surya chandra madhyam surya chandra se peeche rahete hai
 That is why slow fruit is negative
 mandoch se madhyam grah ke antar kii mandakentre sangya he
 At the difference of 3 zodiacs from the retarded, the bradycardia is perishable
 use mandantya fal kehete hai
 The apparent planet from Mendeich to Mendoch is ahead of the middle planet, hence Mandafal is wealth
 mandaspasht ravi chandra ke mandafal ko gyaat karne ke liye do prakaar ke kshetron kii kalpana he, jinhen bhangi kehete hai
 The name of the first is the circumcision
 bhu ko centre maanakar ek trigya ke vyasaradh se vrutt khinchaa, vah kakshavritt hua
 Drawing a circle with a radius diameter from its center, cut as the sine of the dimer at its vertical diameter, it will be retarded
 madhyam grah ko mandprativrutt main chalata kalpit kiya
 If you cut an arc equal to the center of the orbit even in the orbit, then there will be a middle planet in the orbit
 bhucendre se prativrutt sthit grah tak khinchi gai rekha kakshavritt main jahow lage vah mandaspasht grah hoga
 The difference between the medium and dim planets of the orbit will be retarded
 nichoch bhangi ke liye kakshavritt par sthit madhyam grah se mandantyafaljya tulya vyasaradh se ek vrutt khinch lete hai, jise mandaparidhi vrutt kehete hai
 a line going from the center of the orbit to the middle planet, where it is in the diagonal, is assumed to be dim, in the opposite direction in the dim periphery, the planets are imagined at the fractions of the center
 grah se bhucendre ko milaanevaali rekha jis sthaan par kakshavritt ko kaate vahaan mandaspasht grah hoga
 In this way, the dim sun and the moon show us at those places, because their sight is visible to us in relation to the earth
 shesh grahon ke liye bhi mandafal nikaalane kii waisi hi kalpana he
 Their dimorphs are made known by the illumination of the apparent planet by knowledge of the mentals
 ye mandaspasht grah drishy nahin hote, kyonki prithvi unke bhraman kaa centre nahin he
 It is clear from the above discussion that the dim planet is the enjoyment of the planet revolving in its orbit
 atev bhudrishy banane ke liye paanch grahon ke liye sheeghra fal kii kalpana kii gai he
 To clarify Mars, Mercury, Guru, Venus, and Saturn, an early fruit is conceived
 iske liye bhi mand prativrutt tathaa mandanichoch jaisi bhangiyon kii kalpana kii jaati he, jiske liye mand ke sthaan par sheeghra shabd rakh diya jaataa he
 Only the actual Madhyamgrahs for ingestions are called Jyotrikh
 unke madhya adhiktam ravigrahantar kone ko paramshighrafal, paramshighrafal kii jya ko shighranty faljya kehete hai
 The difference between the planet and the astral is the quick center
 isamen mandafal ke liye banaai gai bhangiyon kii tarah bhangiyaan banaakar shighrafal nikaala jaataa he
 With this type of rite, the position of the planet is known by making a favorable angle of the planet
 bahirgrahon ke liye ravikendrik paramalamban kii paramshighrafal tathaa ravi ko shighrochch maanakar shighrafal gyaat kiya jaataa he
 Acharyas have prescribed the method of sacrament of the early fruit in such a way that the enjoyment of the available planet can come true
 grahon kii kakshaayen chandra, budh, shukr, ravi, bhoum, guru, shani ke kram se uttarottar prithvi se dur hai
 Their center is believed to be Earth 1
 Although the radius of each orbit for the means of the planets is assumed to be radius equal, their distance varies because of their diffusivity
 shighrantyafalajyaon or trigyaon kii grahakakshavyasaardhan or ravikkshavyasaradh se tulana karne par budh, shukr, mangal, brihaspati tathaa shani kii kakshaon ke vyasaradh prithvi se ravi kii duuri ke saapeksh

 Their values have been known to be earthquakes
 tamograh rahu ketu sadaa chandramaa ke paaton par kalpit kiye jate hai
 The speed of the path is inverse
 grahanadhikaron main surya tathaa chandra ke grahanon kaa ganit he
 The eclipse of the Moon is believed to be due to the entering of the Earth's eclipse and the solar eclipse being covered by the Sun
 suryagrahan main lamban ke kaaran bhukendriya chandra tathaa hamen dikhaai denevol chandra main bahut antar aa jaataa he
 Therefore, knowledge of parallax is done for this
 chandrashrangonnati main chandramaa kii kalaon ko gyaat kiya jaataa he
 In the planetary authority, the period of the planets and the method of perforation in the favorable period and the revolution of sun and moon are considered in the right
 bhinn ayan tathaa ek golardh main hone par, sayan rivechand ke yoga 180° ke samay krantisamya hone par, vyatipaat tathaa ek ayan bhinn golardh main hone par vahi yoga 360° ke tulya ho to krantisamya main vaidhruti hoti he
 Both of these are prohibited for auspicious work
 grahayuti main grahon ke ati saannnidhya kii sthitiyon kaa ganit he
 Regulators of constellations are given in the Bhagrahayuti
 bhartiya jyotish pranali se banaae tithipatr ko panchang kehete hai
 There are five parts of the calendar: date, war, constellation, yoga and Karan
 panchang main inke atirikt dainik, dainik lagnaspasht, grahachaar, grahon ke suryasaannnidhya se udai or ast or chandrodayast die rahete hai
 Apart from these, there are various Muhurta and religious festivals
 kandarachhina, gangolihot tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke pithoragarh jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Patanjali wrote a commentary on some of the selected sutras of Panini's Ashtadhyayi, which was named grammarmahabhashya)
 vyakaran mahabhashya main katyayan vaarthik bhi sammilit hai jo panini ke ashtaadhi par katyayan ke bhashya hai
 Katyayan's annual total is about 1500, which is not found elsewhere, but is available only as a reference by Patanjali in grammar language
 sanskrit ke teen mahaan vaiyakarnon main patanjali bhi hai
 The other two are Panini and Katyayan

 baans lakadahare kii kahani ek 10veen shatabdi kii japani monogatari he
 It is considered the oldest prose story of Japanese folklore, although its oldest extant manuscript dates from 1592
 is kahani ko apane nayika ke kaaran rajkumaari kaguya kii kahani ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The story is primarily a description of the life of a mysterious girl named kaguya-hime, who was found as an infant inside a glowing bamboo tree
 ek din, ek vruddh, nissantan baans lakadahaara, jiskaa naam tha taaketori no okina baan ke jangal se guzar rahaa tha
 He suddenly finds a mysterious, glowing bamboo stalk
 use katkar kholane par, use andar ek shishu mila jo uske anguuthe jitna bada tha
 He was happy to find such a beautiful girl and took her home with him
 usne or uski patni ne us shishu kii apane santan jaise parvarish kii or use naam diya kaguya-hime 
 After that, Taketori no Okina found that whenever he cut bamboo stings, there was a nugget inside
 dhire-dhire vah amir ho gaya
 kaguya-hime grew up from a small child to a woman of simple size and extraordinary beauty
 taaketori no okina use bahari logon se dur rakhane kii koshish karata tha, par samay ke saath uski sundarataa kii khabar failati gai
 Finally the five princes arrive at Taketori no Okina's house with a proposal to marry kaguya-hime
 rajkumaron ne dhire-dhire taaketori no okina ko manaa liya ki vah kaguya-hime ko un paanchon main se kisi ko chune
 kaguya-hime created an impossible task for the princes, and said that the prince who brought his prescribed item would marry her
 us raat, taaketori no okina ne paanchon ko bataaya ki kise kya laana he
 The first is said to have brought a stone begging bowl of Gautama Buddha from India, the second a covered twig from the mythical island of Horai, the third a Chinese fire-robe, the fourth a colorful gem from a dragon's neck, and The fifth one was born from sparrows
 pehla raahakumaar samaj gaya kii yah kaary asambhav tha, isliye vah ek mahangaa katoraa lekar aayaa, par katoraa divya prakaash se ujjwal nahin tha, jisase kaguya-hise uski chaal ko samaj gai
 Similarly, two other princes also tried to cheat him with fake items but failed
 chauthe ne ek tufaan kaa saamana karne ke baad haar maan liya or paanchava apane prayaas main maaraa gaya 
 Subsequently, the Emperor of Japan, Mikado, came to see this exceptionally beautiful kaguya-hime, and after being enchanted, proposed marriage to her
 unako rajkumaron jaise asambhav kaary nahin diya gaya, par kaguya-hime ne unka prastaav asweekaar kar diya, yah kahkar ki vah unke desh kii nahin he isliye unke saath mahal nahin ja sakati
 She kept in touch with the emperor, but rejected his requests and proposals
 us greeshm kaal main, jab bhi kaguya-hime poornima ko dekhati thi, uski ankhen bhar aati thim
 Taketori no Okina and his wife were very worried about this and asked her, but she could not tell them their grief
 uskaa vyavhaar or asthir hota gaya jab tak ek din usne yah zaahir kiya ki vah is duniya kii nahin he or use chaand par apane logon ke paas waapas janaa padegaa
 Some versions of the story say that he was sent to Earth as a punishment for a crime, but in some others he was sent to be protected during a celestial war
 jo sona taaketori no okina ko mil rahaa tha, vah darasal kaguya-hime kaa dhyaan rakhane ke liye chaand se bheja gaya vetan tha
 As the day of his return drew near, the emperor sent guards to his house to keep him away from the people of the moon, but when the delegation of "celestial beings" arrived at the door of Taketori no Okina, the guards with a strange light Blinded
 kaguya-hime ne ghoshnaa kii ki bhale hi vah prithvi par apane sabhi mitron se pyaar karti he, use chaand par apane sachche ghar par lautnaa hoga
 He wrote sorrowful apologies to his family and the emperor, and gave his clothes to the family as a memorial
 phir usne amrit ko halkaa sa chakhaa, apane khat se use joda or ek adhikari ko diya
 After she was put to death, a cloak of feathers was placed on her shoulders, and she forgot all her sorrow and kindness towards the Earthlings
 phir akashiya dal use tsuki no miako par le gaye, uske rote-bilakhte mata-pita ko chhodkar
 Taketori no Okina and his wife became extremely unhappy and fell ill
 vah adhikari kaguya-hime ke die vastuon ke saath samraat ke paas pahunchaa or puure ghatana kii vyakhya kii
 The Emperor was filled with sorrow after reading his letter
 unhone apane sevakon se poocha "koun sa parvat swarg se sabase qareeb he?", jiskaa ek ne uttar diya "suruga praant kaa mahaan parvat"
 The emperor ordered that his servants take that vat to the top of the mountain and burn it, in the hope that his message would reach the princess
 unhone amrit ko bhi jalaane kaa aadesh diya, kyonki ve kaguya-hime ko bina dekhe hameshaa ke liye jeena nahin chaahate the
 The word for immortality in Japanese, ता, is said to have become the name of the mountain, Mount Fuji
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki parvat ke naam kaa kanji 富士山 samraat ke sena ke parvat par chadhane ke aayaa he
 It is said that the smoke of burning pitches still comes out from the top of the mountain

 Okutsu has provided a review of the research and found that Jinyu Fenghuang is a book published for children, so the editor made changes to some stories

 Katappa continues to listen to his story of how he killed Bahubali


 kalkey se jeetne ke baad, mahishmati main amarendra bahubali ko bhavishya kaa raja or bhallaal dev ko senapati ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 Even before the coronation, Amarendra's mother Shivgami starts searching for her bride
 vah amarendra or katappa ko kahati he ki samrajya kii sthiti or iske logon ko samajhane ke liye iskaa daura karen
 Amarendra falls in love with the princess of the Kuntal kingdom and her king's sister, Devasena
 bhallaal ko pataa chal jaataa he ki amarendra ko devsena se pyaar ho gaya he
 He then tells Shivagami that he wants to marry Devasena
 shivgami ko is bare main nahin pataa hota he ki devsena se amarendra pyaar karata he, is kaaran vah uski shaadi devsena se karaane kaa vaada kar detii he
 When Sivagami sends the marriage proposal to the Kuntal state, the messenger writes the proposal as if an arrogant person wrote it
 devsena is shaadi ke prastaav ko kade shabdon ke saath manaa kar detii he
 When Sivagami gets her answer, she orders to bring Devasena captive in anger
 kuntal samrajya par pinjariyon kaa hamalaa ho jaataa he
 With the help of Devasena's brother Kumar Verma, Amarendra foils the attack and saves Kuntal
 amarendra use bataa detaa he ki vah koun he or shivgami ke krodh ke bhay ko dur karne or use apni dulhan banane hetu raji karne kii koshish karata he
 When he reaches Mahismati, he discovers a misunderstanding
 shivgami use singhaasana yaa devsena main se kisi ek ko chunane bolti he
 He chooses Devasena
 is kaaran bhallaal ko vahaan kaa raja bana diya jaataa he or amarendra ko senapati par phir bhi log use hi raja maanate hai
 Amarendra was discharged by Bhallal as the commander of the army for Devasena's baby shower, so that he could live with his wife
 usee samay devsena raja bhallaal ke herpher ke khilaaf bolti he or shivgami ke chup rahane par bhi sawaal uthaati he
 This causes a quarrel and the two are forced out of the palace
 vah donon baahar logon ke bich khushi se jindagi bitaane lage the, par bhallaal phir se shivgami ko bhadakaata he ki amarendra use maarna chahta he or yah bhi bolta he ki yadi usne sidhi kaarywahi kii to grih yuddh shuru ho saktaa he
 For this reason, Sivagami speaks to Kattappa, his servant, that he is in trouble and has to kill Amarendra
 shivgami ke kehane par katappa ne amarendra kii peeth par dhokhe se hamalaa kar use maar diya
 Then Katappa comes and informs Shivgami that Amarendra Bahubali has died
 devsena bhi apane bachche mahendra bahubali ke saath vahaan aati he or use bhi is bare main pataa chalata he
 Shivagami tells the bewildered crowd outside the palace that Amarendra is dead and now his son Mahendra Bahubali will be the new king
 iske baad bhallaal or uske log milakar devsena or uske bachche ko pakad kar karawas main daalane kii koshish karte hai
 Devasena hands his child to Sivagami who manages to escape, but Devasena is unable to save himself
 use kaid kar liya jaataa he
 After 25 years, Mahendra Bahubali, son of Bhallaldev and Amarendra Bahubali, has a fierce battle and Bhallaldev is defeated in this war

 Despite the church's nose-and-eye shrink after preaching Christianity, it survived as a Karol, from the traditional havelis to the simple huts
 utsavon, santadivason or christmas ityadi ke naish jaagran ke avasar par janata is samuhik nritygan kaa aayojan swayan carch ke ahaate main hi karti rahi
 In Karol, the protagonist of the group used to sing the new line one after the other, and the rest of them held each other in chakra and performed tak or tunes
