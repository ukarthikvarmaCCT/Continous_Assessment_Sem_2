 yah ski drishyon ko dikhaata he jo habbal doorabeen ke antariksh tasveeron ke sahyog se bana hota he
 It was created on 27 August 2007
 pehle google ski sanskaran ko google arth naamak abhaasi globe par banaaya janaa tha
 Its features are many layers, which are similar to Earth mode
 yah google arth kshetra ke bhitari bhaag main chitron dwaara pratichitrit he, jisamen uttar or dakshin dhruv google ski ke do dhruvon ke saath chalati hai, ise centre se andar se bahar kii ore dekhne par dekha ja saktaa he

 The launch of the Google Sky website was posted on March 13, 2008, in an article by Google software engineer Michael weis-malik in the Google Lat Long blog
 yah kisi bhi web brouzar or oparating system se abhigamya he or 26 bhashaaon main main uplabdh he

 Features include: do virdohi vyaktiyon yaa dalon ke bich, purvanishchit tathaa jane maane niyamon ke anusaar prachlit shastron dwaara yuddh ko dwandvayuddh kehete hai
 Such wars were prevalent in many countries in ancient times
 inke prachlan ke mul main yah vishwaas tha ki in yudhon main ishwar usee ko jitata he jiske paksh main nyaay hota he
 Such wars were considered crusades in India
 vaidic kaal main dwandvayudhon kaa prachlan tha
 In the later Vedic period, pre-existing practices were reformed by making new rules regarding them
 ramayana or mahabharat main dwandvayudhon ke anek ullekh hai
 The wars of Rama Ravana, Bali Sugriva and Duryodhana and Bhima are examples of this
 parvarti kaal main bhi in yudhon kaa yathesht prachlan tha
 This method was adopted to decide the things which could not be resolved among the Kshatriyas in other ways
 bahudhaa aisa hota tha ki yuddh ke liye sena lekar do raajaaon ke aamane saamne khadey hone par, raktapaat bachaane ke liye yah nishchay kiya jaataa tha ki virdohi senaaon main se ek ek, yaa nishchit baraabar sankhyaon main, yoddha aapas main dharmayuddh se laden or jis paksh kaa yoddha jite usee kii jeet maani jaae
 Sometimes by fighting the soldiers, one king or general commanding the other to battle and the victory of the couple's victory would settle the feud of the states
 yah reeti dakshin bharat ke hindu raajaaon main kuch sau varsh purv tak prachlit thi
 The duel in other countries was also practiced because of the belief that it was a method of divine justice, but it was not universally accepted in some form from Japan to Aryland and from the Mediterranean to the northern latitudes
 europe ke pracheen panditon ke anusaar bible main varnit david or goliath kaa nyayuddh ishwaranumodith tha
 On this basis, the rationale of duel was accepted in the medieval period
 atipracheen kaal se aadisht dwandvayuddh ke europe main pranrabh kaa thik pataa nahin chalata, kintu elliod main varnit menelmos or paris is prasiddh yuddh ke aarambh main sampadit vistrut vidhiyon se is granth ke lekhak unani kavi homer ke samay prachlit is sambandh ke shishtachar kii prathaon or pracheen ritiyon kaa pataa chalata he
 Evidence of the practice of dueling is found in the inhabitants of the territory of Ambria in ancient Italy and also among the Slavic castes
 kintu rome rajya main isaki pratha na thi, varan romavaasi ise asabhy logon kaa chalan samajhate the
 But even in this period, the famous Roman commander, Sipio Afracanus, found it prevalent in Spain in 203 BC
 pracheen german jatiyon main bhi iskaa prachlan tha
 Due to the strategic traditions that led to the era of feudalism and the brave warriors in Europe, after the fall of the Roman Empire, the duel also took over all of Europe in the kingdom of Louis debonaire, who established the empire from 814 to 840
 The judge would have ordered a duel if the accused had been convicted and the defendant disapproved of it
 isamen andeh nahin ki dwandvayudhon kii bhaavana ke mul main saahas par aadhaarit nijee pratishtha or sammaan kaa bhav bhi tha
 If a defiant person did not accept to fight, he was considered cowardly and inferior
 europe main 16veen sadi ke madhya tak dwandvayuddh se nyaay kii pratha saadhaarant: vidhisammat thi
 These wars were fought by standing in confined areas and bound by fixed laws and strict rules
 ek sarvaprachlit niyam ke anusaar, jis manushya ko lalakaara jaataa tha usee ko hathiyaaron ke chunane kaa adhikaar hota tha
 According to another rule, any kind of witchcraft, or any kind of help from friends and audience, was forbidden
 is prakaar ke yuddh main yadhyapi dwandv shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, tathaapi bharat ke sadrush europe main bhi kabhi kabhi yuddhrat prayek paksh main anek manushya hote the
 Thus a battle took place in 1396 in the Royal and Scottish castes of King Robert III
 isamen prayek paksh ke 30 yoddha tab tak ladate rahe jab tak ek paksh main keval 10 manushya jivit batch rahe
 In France, Henry II ended the judicial duel in 1547 in front of a king or tribunal
 iske pratikriyaswaroop nijee dwandvayudhon kii tathaa inamen mrityu paryant ladane kii paripati chal padi
 Along with those who fought in such wars, two or more friends also lived to see that no irregularity or injustice should occur
 san 1578 main france ke raja ke priypaatr kelus tathaa geez ke duk ke kripabhajan sier de duns main dwandvayuddh hua
 Due to its political background, the friendly inspectors who came from both sides came to a halt in each other
 falat: in mitron main se do khet rahe
 One died later and the fourth was seriously hurt
 is ghatana ne nirikshakon ke bhi dwandvayuddh main bhaag lene kii pratha ko, jo aage lagbhag 75 varshon tak chaalu rahi, europe bhar main janm diya
 In the 16th and 17th centuries, a number of laws were enacted in most of the countries of Europe to oppose the duel, but when defying war, it was considered cowardice, such wars were rampant in the society and the central power was limited
 in kaarnon se ye roke na ja sake
 But in 1643, the situation changed when Louis the 14th ascended to the throne of France, as he set the death penalty for those who took part in such wars
 tab prakaashya rup se is prakaar ke yuddh band ho gaye, par ve duusare rup main chalate rahe
 Those desirous of a duel would fight alone in a secluded place without expressing any of the short swords prevailing at the time and if one of them was killed, the other would have saved his life by saying that the act was done in self-defense to avoid the law
 
 par jab is pratha kii aad main hatyaayein hone lageen to nirjan sthaan main dwandvayuddh hona band ho gaya or nirikshakon kii pratha phir chal padi, par ye swayan nahin ladate the
 Sword fighting was the practice until the 19th century
 tab tak in yudhon main niyamon kaa kadai se paalan karnaa aavashyak kar diya gaya tha tathaa france main jyon hi raktapaat hua, yuddh band kar diya jaataa tha
 Thus there was no possibility of special loss in these wars
 is samay tathaa baad main bhi germany ke vidhyaarthiyon main ek vishesh prakaar kii talwaar se dwandv yuddh kaa chalan tha, par isamen shariraraksha ke sadhano, jaise kavach ityadi, kaa upyog hota tha or ghaav lage bhi to vah saadhaarant: uparisht hota tha
 The use of pistols in these wars began from the mid-18th century
 prarambh se yah pratha thi ki talwaar tathaa khanjar se susajjit ghudsavaar pratidwandvi, haathon main bhari hui pistaul liye, ek duusare par jhapat padate the tathaa paas se guzarate samay ek duusare par pistaul chalaate the
 If both the warriors survived, they would return and fight with swords and daggers
 san 1780 tak bhoomi par khadey hokar pistaul se dwandv yuddh ladanaa bhalee bhanti prachlit ho gaya tha or is kaary ke liye vishesh prakaar ke pistaul banaae jane lage the
 This type of warfare was most prevalent in England during the reign of George IV, when the Duke of Wellington, Lord Vinchilsey, the Marquis of Londonderry and the famous banquet soldier, Bo Brammel, also landed in the arena of the duel
 is prakaar ke yudhon main hataahaton kii sankhya kaa anumaan san 1836 main likhe ek lekh se lagata he, jiske lekhak ke anusaar pistaul ke do sau se upar panjikrut dwandvayudhon main prayek chah manushyon main se ek ghayal paaya gaya tathaa prati 13 manushyon main se ek kii mrityu hui
 The misuse and ill effects of these types of wars were becoming evident from the long standing before the sensible people
 europe ke vibhinn deshon main inako rokane ke liye niyam banaaya gaya ki dwandvayuddh ke aparaadhiyon ko padchyut kar diya jaae
 The effect of this was that it stopped the practice of both military and civilian citizens of England
 san 1850 ke lagbhag anya sab deshon se bhi yah pratha uth gai

 To prevent this poisonous leak, they set the gas on fire
 unka anumaan tha ki gas kuch hi dinon main jalakar khatm ho jaaegi, lekin yah aag dashakon baad aaj bhi jal rahi he
 In April 2001, the President of Turkmenistan, Gurbanaguli Berdimuhammedov, visited the area and ordered that either the holes be closed or other natural gas extraction plans in the area be freed from the effects of the smoldering fire here
 turkmenistan yahan se gas nikalakar china, bharat, iran, rus va pashchimi europe ko niryaat karnaa chahta he

 kehete hai, shasta kaa janm mohini veshadhari vishnu or shiv ke samagam se hua tha
 The famous temple of Ayyappan is located in this Dham, situated among 18 hills, known as Punakavan, which is called Sabarimala Sridharmashastha Temple
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki parashuram ne ayppan puja ke liye sabarimala main murti sthapit kii thi
 Some people also associate it with the name of Rambhakta Shabari
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki kareeb 700-800 saal pehle dakshin main shaiva or vaishnavon ke bich vaimnasy kaaphi bad gaya tha
 Mr
 Ayyappan was then envisaged to address those differences
 donon ke samanvay ke liye is dharmatirth ko viksit kiya gaya
 Even today, this temple is considered a symbol of harmony and harmony
 yahaan kisi bhi jati-birdari kaa or kisi bhi dharm kaa paalan karne vaala vyakti aa saktaa he
 On reaching Pampa, we decided to travel to Sabarimala on foot

 Sri Ayyappan's birth is considered to be on the day of coincidence of Makar Sankranti and Uttara Phalguni Nakshatra, coinciding with Panchami Tithi and Scorpio Lagna

 We reached there on the day of Makar Sankranti
 yah mandir sthapaty ke lihaaj se to khubasurat he hi, yahaan ek ajeeb kism kii shanti kaa ahsaas bhi hota he
 Just as it is situated between 18 hills, similarly one has to cross 18 steps to reach the temple courtyard

 Ayyappan is anointed with ghee during the festival
 mantron kaa jor-jor se uccharan ho rahaa tha

 Apart from Makar Sankranti, there is a big celebration on 17th of November
 malayalam maheenon ke pehle paanch din bhi mandir ke kapaat khole jate hai
 Apart from these, the doors of the temple remain closed for common visitors throughout the year

 Most of the male devotees were present here

 Therefore, there can be small girls here, who are not menstruating or old women, who have become free from it
 jati-dharm kaa bandhan na maanane ke baavjood yah bandhan shraddhaluon ko maananaa hota he
 The rest, a wonderful example of secularism, is seen at a place called Erumeli, just a few miles from here, as the mausoleum of the Muslim Dharmanuayi Vavar, considered an ally of Mr
 Ayyappan, where the visit here would not have been complete without waiting for a visit
 do maton ke samanvay ke alaava dharmik sahishnutaa kaa ek niraala hi rup yahaan dekhne ko mila

 When many countries work together to solve a problem, it is called multilateral diplomacy
 regela ke matanusaar, ”bahupaksheeya rajnay rajanyik sandhi vaartaon kii ek takanic he tathaa rajnay ke anya sabhi pahaluon kii tarah prakriya main asankhya jatil niyamon se aabaddh rahati he
 " aaj rashtron ke madhya sambandhon ke kshetra main sabase adhik mahatvapurn vikaas dwipaksheeya rajnay ke sthaan par bahupaksheeya rajnay kaa vikaas he
 Multilateral diplomacy is completely different from traditional methods of bilateral diplomacy
 bahupaksheeya rajnay ko sanyukt rajnay bhi kaha jaataa he
 The bulk of today's international relations are accomplished only through multilateral conferences
 bahupaksheeya rajnay kaa prachlan or prabhaav sadaa ek sa nahin rahata he varan paristhitiyon ke anusaar badalata rahata he
 In the 19th century, a new form of the use of diplomacy through international conventions and conferences "multilateral diplomacy" has come to us
 aaj ke jatil yug main anterrashtriya samasyayen kaaphi jatil hai
 Therefore, international problems can be solved only by multilateral conferences

 It has become the main process of diplomacy
 bahupaksheeya rajnay aadhunik yug ke liye ek nai rajanyik pravidhi he jo parivartit jatil samasyaon kaa saamana karne ke liye nikaali gai he

 Multilateral diplomacy begins with modern polity
 armbh main shaanti sthapana athwa shaanti sandhi ke liye bulaaye jate the kintu baad main anterrashtriya samasyaon kaa samaadhaan hetu inkaa prayog kiya jane laga
 Any state can call a multilateral conference to resolve differences or resolve problems between states
 bahupaksheeya rajnay ke madhyam se vibhinn anterrashtriya samasyaon ke nidaan or shaanti tathaa suraksha kaa lagaataar prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 To maintain co-operation and harmony between different countries, multilateral diplomacy is being used to try to build good relations by reducing hostility with enemy states, to overcome mutual differences and to establish peaceful co-existence
 aaj vishwa kii anek jatil samasyaon ke samaadhaan evam vichaar-vimarsh main lagbhag sabhi rajya hissaa lete hai
 The desire of newly emerging small states to participate in multilateral conferences and their place as big states, their economic, technological, scientific development and self-reliance of states on each other has increased the importance of multilateral conferences
 rajnay ke praarambhik kaal main rajanyik aupchaariktaayen adhik baratate the
 But in multilateral diplomacy, personal contact turns into friendship
 yah mitrataa kisi samasya ke sheeghra hal nikaalane ke liye kaaphi laabhakaari siddh hoti he
 Complex problems that could not be solved for years are resolved by multilateral convention

 Multilateral diplomacy also has many faults

 Failures and treaties made in these conferences also lead to differences in various states and the importance of multilateral diplomacy decreases
 jahaan bahupaksheeya rajnay vyaktigat mitrataa tathaa vishwaas ko badhaata he vahi vyaktigat shatruta or avishvaas ko bhi isse janm miltaa he
 Nicholson is of the view that diplomacy leads to wastage of time and money

 Cystoscopy is endoscopy of the bladder, done through the urethra
 yah systoscope kii sahaayta se kii jaati he
 Clinical cystoscopy is performed with local anesthesia
 shalya-kriyaatmak systoscopy prakriya ke liye kabhi-kabhi vyapak anaesthesia bhi diya jaataa he
 The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body
 systoscope main doordarshee athwa sookshmdarshi kii tarah hi lens lage hote hai
 These lenses allow the physician to focus on the internal surfaces of the urethra
 kuch systoscope optical fibar kaa prayog karte hai jo upkaran ke agrabhag se chhavi ko duusare sire par lage vuing pis par pradarshit karte hai
 Cystoscopes range in thickness from a pencil up to 9 mm and have a light source on their obverse
 kai systoscope main kuch atirikt naliyaan bhi lagi hoti hai jo mutr sambandhi samasyaon ke upachaar hetu shalya-kriyaatmak prakriyaaon ke liye aavashyak upkarnon kaa maarg-pradarshan karti hai
 There are two types of cystoscopy - flexible and rigid - it is based on the difference of flexibility of the cystoscope
 flexible systoscopy donon lingon main sthaneey anaesthesia kii sahaayta se kii jaati he
 Typically, xylocaine gel is used as an anesthetic, it is injected into the urethra
 rigid systoscopy bhi saamaan paristhitiyon main kii ja sakati he, parantu saamaanya rup se yah vyapak anaesthesia dekar, vishesh rup se purush marijon main prob se hone vaale ksht ke kaaran, kii jaati he
 a doctor may recommend cystoscopy in the following situations: yadi mariz ke mutrmarg main upar kii ore koi pathari ataki ho, chikitsak ek kahin patale scope kaa prayog kar ke mutrashay se hokar mutrvahiniyon tak pahunch saktaa he, is upkaran ko urateroscope kehete hai
 The doctor can see the stone and remove it with a small piece of wire at the end of a wire, which is inserted into the ureteroscope with an extra tube
 badi pathariyon ke liye chikitsak urateroscope main atirikt nalee ke dwaara ek lacheela tantu, jisamen leisure kiran hoti he, ke dwaara us pathari ko chote tukdon main tod detaa he jo tab, mutr ke dwaara sharir se baahar nikal jate hai
 Although physicians give special instructions, in most cases, patients can eat normally and do their daily activities after the test
 marijon ko kabhi-kabhi pareekshan se pehle mutr kaa namoona dene ko kaha jaataa he jisase usamen sankraman kaa pataa lagaaya ja sake
 These patients should ensure that they do not urinate for a sufficient period, so that they can urinate at this time before the test
 marijon ko apane sharir ke nichle hisse ko dhankane vaale kapadey utaarne hote hai, haalanki kuch chikitsak yah pasand karte hai ki mariz aspataal kaa goun pahane or apane sharir ke nichle hisse ko roganuhin kiye gaye parade se dhank le
 adhikanshtah, mariz ko apni peeth ke bal let kar apane ghutanon ko failaana hota he
 Sometimes, the patient may have to lift his knees
 vishesh rup se aisa tab kiya jaataa he jab uskaa rigid systoscopy pareekshan kiya ja rahaa ho
 During the flexible cystoscopy procedure, the patient is almost always conscious and local anesthesia is used to reduce his or her suffering
 aise maamalon main, jinamein rigid systoscopy kii aavashyaktaa ho, mariz ko vyapak anaesthesia dena asaamaanya nahin he, kyonki aisa, vishesh rup se purush marijon main, adhik kshtdaayak ho saktaa he
 a doctor, nurse or technician cleans the area around the urethra and applies local anesthesia
 sthaneey anaesthesia ko tub se sidhe hi athwa bina sui kii syringe kii sahaayta se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Often, skin preparation is done with the help of Hibitane
 aise mariz jinaki uratoscopy kii jaani ho, un par ridh kii haddi main lagaaye jane vaale athwa vyapak anaesthesia kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The doctor gently inserts the cystoscope's forearm into the urethra and directs it to the bladder
 yah sampoorn prakriya purushon main mahilaon kii apeksha adhik kshtdaayi hoti he kyonki purush mutrmarg adhik lambaa tathaa sankara hota he
 This part of the test can be simplified by relaxing the muscles of the pelvic region
 systoscope se hokar ek roganuhin taral padaarth pravaahit kiya jaataa he jisase dhire-dhire mutrashay ko bharaa ja sake or tab vah fail kar chikitsak ko mutrashay kii deevaaron kaa behatar drishy pradaan kiya ja sake
 When the bladder starts filling up to its capacity, then the patients are particularly uncomfortable and desire to urinate
 systoscope ko daalane se lekar nikaalane tak kaa samay kuch minuton kaa hi hota he, parantu yadi chikitsak vahaan pathari paata he athwa aise maamalon main jahaan biopsy kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, samay adhik lag saktaa he
 The action of taking a biopsy can prolong this process
 adhikansh maamalon main, taiyaari sahit sampurna pareekshan main lagbhag 15 se 20 minute kaa samay lagata he
 After the test, patients often feel a burning sensation during urination and often they also see small amounts of blood in the urine
 rigid upkarnon kaa prayog karte hue kii jane vaali prakriyaaon ke parinamswarup mutr-sambandhi asanyam tathaa risaav, agyaat kaarnon se mutrmarg ko hui kshati ke kaaran hota he
 Occasionally, patients have lower abdominal pain, which indicates bladder muscle spasms, but it usually does not

 Diesel engine cars were long known in Europe, with the first models introduced in the 1930s by Mercedes Benz and Citroën
 The main advantages of diesel engines were that they had a 50% higher burn efficiency when compared to the best gasoline engines
 , Which had 27%

 The carburetor was used in almost all road-going car engines until the 1980s, when it was used to obtain better control over the mixture of fuel and air, which was found by fuel injection
 Indirect fuel injection was first in aircraft engines
 Used in 1909, it was used in racing car engines in the 1930 Satak and was used in road cars since the 1950s

 After a small change, gasoline-powered vehicles can run at 85% ethanol concentrations
 00% ethanol is used in some parts of the world, but vehicles must be started on pure gasoline and then switched to ethanol
 When the engine is running
 Most of the gasoline powered engines are also run by LPG, where an LPG tank is used for fuel storage and LPG mixer is used for carbureation

 For some time, electrics were considered superior due to their silent nature when they were compared to the noisy gasoline engine
 This advantage was removed in 1897 by Muffler, the inventor of Hiram Percy Maxim
 Thereafter internal combustion The power cars had two significant advantages: 1) long range and 2) four specific energy
 The battery electric vehicle was built to rival the internal combustion model and they were Had to Tsar until modern semiconductor controls and improved starting batteries
 Because they could deliver a higher torque at lower resolutions, electric cars did not require such a complex drive train nor transmissions that internal combustion cars needed

 Esteem power, mostly used for oil - or gas - used boilers, was used until the 1930s, but its major disadvantage was that it could not provide electricity to the tax until boiler pressure was available
 This is that it gives very low emissions and because of this the combustion process can be controlled very carefully
 Its disadvantages include weak heat efficiency and expansion needs

 As an example, modern engine compartments are open from the bottom so that fuel vapors, which are filled with air, get out in the open air
 Brakes are hydraulic and dual circuits so that the possibility of brake failure from full star is very low
 Systematic research on accident safety started at Ford Motor Company in 1958
 Since then, most of the research is focused on absorbing external crash energy
 With crushable panels and in reducing the speed of the human body in the passenger compartment
 This is reflected in most cars that are made right now

 Nana Saheb was the architect of the first struggle of Indian independence of 1857
 unka mul naam 'dhondupant' tha
 Nana Saheb led the rebels against the British in Kanpur in the freedom struggle
 
 Nana Saheb was born in 1824 to Madhavnarayan Rao, a resident of Venugram
 inke pita peshwa bajirao dwitiya ke sagotra bhai the
 The Peshwa accepted the child Nanarao as his adopted son and made adequate arrangements to initiate his education
 unhen hathi ghode kii sawari, talwaar va bandook chalaane kii vidhi sikhaai gai or kai bhashaaon kaa acha gyaan bhi karaayaa gaya
 Peshwa died on 28 January 1851
 nanarav ne badi shaan ke saath peshwa kaa antim sanskaar kiya
 The question of the succession of the late Peshwa arose
 company ke shashan ne bithur sthit kamishnar ko yah aadesh diya ki vah nanarav ko yah soochna de ki shashan ne unhen keval peshwai dhan sampatti kaa hi uttaradhikari mana he na ki peshwa kii oopaadhi kaa yaa usase sanlagn rajnatik va vyaktigat suvidhaon kaa

 ruhelkhand pahunchakar unhone khan bahadur khan ko apana sahyog diya
 By now the British had understood that unless Nana Saheb was caught, the rebellion could not be suppressed
 jab bareli main bhi krantikariyon kii haar hui tab naanaa sahab ne maharana pratap kii bhanti anek ksht sahe parantu unhone firangiyon or unke mitron ke sanmukh aatmasamarpan nahin

 doodh, ghi or agni or prakaash, kramshah anubhav or gyaan or vivek or satya hai or yajna unka ek saamanjasy he
 If man had not associated himself with the sacrificial spirit, then he would have lost his existence in the competition of other animals due to his physical inability and weakness

 If you want to progress further, this will be the basis of it

 Thus, wherever it is seen, it appears that whatever stable system is in this world, it is dependent on the sacrificial practice
 yadi ise hataa diya jaae, to sari sundarata, kurupata main or sari pragati, vinaash main parinat ho jaayegi
 Rishis have said - Yajna is the axle of this world cycle

 The proximity of the sacrificial atmosphere proves to be very useful to make them cultured
 kubuddhi, kuvichaar, durgun evam dushkarmon se vikrut manobhumi main yajna se baari sudhaar hota he
 Therefore Yajna has been called a sinner

 aatma or paramatma ko jod dene kaa, band dene kaa kaary yagyagni dwaara aise hi hota he, jaise lohe ke toote hue tukdon ko belding kii agni jod detii he
 Brahmanism is attained through yajna
 isliye brahmanatv praapt karne ke liye ek tihaai jivan yajna karm ke liye arpit karnaa padataa he
 The inner instinct in the conscience of people decreased - Brahmin instinct increased, for this it is necessary to fill the power of Yagya influence in the environment

 Agnihotra also has physical benefits
 vaayu ko ham mel, mutr, shwaas tathaa kal-kaarkaanon ke dhuaan aadi se ganda karte hai
 Dirty air causes diseases

 Sound vibrations of the mantras, made powerful through sacrificial fire, disintegrate people in a remote area, giving them mental refinement, as a result, mental health also increases like bodies
 anek prayojanon ke liye-anek kaamanaayon kii purti ke liye, anek vidhaanon ke saath, anek vishisht yajna bhi kiye ja sakate hai

 After the Mahabharata, Krishna also had a Mahayagya done by the Pandavas, their aim was to solve the insecurity of the angry atmosphere from the warring disturbance
 jab kabhi akaash ke vaataavaran main asurataa kii maatra bad jaae, to uskaa upachaar yajna prayojanon se badhkar or kuch ho nahin saktaa
 Today, the same disturbance has arisen again in the atmosphere due to increase in the amount of selfishness in the masses due to the last two great wars
