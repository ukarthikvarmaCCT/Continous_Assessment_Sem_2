 It was for this reason that he accepted the practice of advocating a one-year contract with an Indian firm in 1893 in Natal South Africa, which was then part of the British Empire

 In view of the injustice being done to Indians in South Africa, Gandhi raised questions for the honor of his countrymen under the English Empire and for his own position in the country
 1906 main, zulu dakshin africa main nae chunaav kar ke lagu karne ke baad do angrej adhikariyon ko maar daalaa gaya
 In return, the British launched a war against Julu
 gandhi ji ne bharatiyon ko bhartee karne ke liye british adhikariyon ko sakriy rup se prerit kiya
 His argument was that Indians should cooperate in war efforts to legalize their citizenship claims
 tathaapi, angrejon ne apni sena main bharatiyon ko pad dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Despite this, he accepted Gandhiji's proposal that Indians can do voluntary work to bring wounded British soldiers to Stetcher for treatment
 is kor kii bagdor gandhi ne thami
 On 21 July 1906, Gandhiji wrote in the Indian Opinion of the Indian Opinion that a corps has been formed at the behest of the Natal Government by experiment in relation to the operation against 23 Indian residents
 dakshin africa main bhartiya logon se indian opinian main apane cholemon ke madhyam se is yuddh main shaamil hone ke liye aagrah kiya or kaha, yadi sarkaar keval yahi mahasoos karti he ki arakshit bal bekaar ho rahe hai tab ve iskaa upyog karenge or asli ladaai ke liye bharatiyon kaa prashikshan dekar iskaa avasar denge
 In Gandhi's opinion, the draft ordinance of 1906 was like bringing the status of Indians below the level of a resident
 isliye unhone satyagrah, kii tarj par "kafir s " 
kaa udhaaharan dete hue bharatiyon se adhyadesh kaa virodh karne kaa aagrah kiya

 Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1918 in the Champaran Satyagraha and the Kheda Satyagraha, although the movements of indigo cash-paying food crops were also important, rather than the food crops necessary for his subsistence

 This situation was disappointing

 Gandhiji built an ashram there where many of his supporters and new voluntary workers were organized

 Creating confidence in the villagers, he started his work by cleaning the villages under which schools and hospitals were built and the rural leadership was motivated to eliminate many of the social evils mentioned above
 lekin iske pramukh prabhaav us samay dekhne ko mili jab unhen ashaanti failaane ke liye police ne giraftaar kiya or unhen praant chhodane ke liye aadesh diya gaya
 Thousands of people protested and took out rallies outside jails, police stations and courts and demanded Gandhi ji to be released unconditionally
 gandhi ji ne jameendaaron ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan or hadataalon ko kaa netritv kiya jinhone angreji sarkaar ke maargdarshan main us kshetra ke garib kisaanon ko adhik kshatipurti manjuur karne tathaa kheti par niyantran, rajasav main badhotari ko radd karnaa tathaa ise sangrahit karne vaale ek samjhaute par hastakshar kiye
 It was during this struggle that Gandhiji was addressed by the public in the name of Bapu's father and Mahatma
 kheda main sardaar patel ne angrejon ke saath vichaar vimarsh ke liye kisaanon kaa netritv kiya jisamen angrejon ne rajasav sangrahan se mukti dekar sabhi kaidiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya tha
 As a result, Gandhi's fame spread across the country
 gandhi ji ne asahyog, ahimsa tathaa shantipurna pratikaar ko angrejon ke khilaaf shastr ke rup main upyog kiya
 The Jallianwala massacre of Indians by the British forces in Punjab, also known as the Amritsar massacre, caused tremendous shock to the nation, which sparked a flame of anger and violence in the public
 gandhiji ne british raaj tathaa bharatiyon dwaara pratikaratmak ravaiya donon kii kii
 He expressed condolences to the British citizens and victims of the riots and condemned the riots after the initial opposition of the party
 gandhi ji ke bhaavnaatmak bhaashan ke baad apane siddhant kii vakaalat kii ki sabhi hinsa or buraai ko nyyochit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 But it was with this massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhiji focused his mind on bringing complete control over the entire government and the Indian government-occupied institutions, which would soon turn into Swaraj or complete personal, spiritual and political freedom
 disambar 1921 main gandhi jo bhartiya rashtriya congress
kaa kaaryakari adhikari niyukt kiya gaya
 Under his leadership, the Congress was organized with a new objective called Swaraj

 To improve the discipline within it, a Padasopan Samiti was formed to make the party not a single elite organization but to make it a party of the national people
 gandhi ji ne apane ahimsaatmak manch ko swadeshi niti — main shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya jisamen videshi vastuon visheshkar angreji vastuon kaa bahishkaar karnaa tha
 His advocacy associated with this was that all Indians should wear handmade khadi by our own people rather than the clothes made by the British
 gandhi ji ne swatantraaa andolan ko sahyog dene ke liepurushon or mahilaon ko pratidin khaadi ke liye soot kaatne main samay bitaane ke liye kaha
 It was a policy of bringing discipline and dedication to overcome reluctance and ambition and to replace them with women at a time when there were many ideas that such activities are not respectable for women
 iske alaava gandhi ji ne britain kii shaikshik sansthaaon tathaa adaalaton kaa bahishkaar or sarkari naukariyon ko chhodane kaa tathaa sarkaar se praapt tamagon or sammaan ko waapas lautaane kaa bhi anurodh kiya
 Non-cooperation got far-reaching appeal and success which increased the enthusiasm and participation of people from all sections of the society
 phir jaise hi yah andolan apane sheersh par pahunchaa vaise farvari 1922 main iskaa ant chauri-chora, uttarapradesh main bhayanak dwesh ke rup main ant hua
 In view of the fear of the movement adopting a stand of violence and considering that it would destroy all its actions, Gandhiji withdrew this movement of widespread non-cooperation

 gandhi ji ne is khai ko bahut se sadhano se bharne kaa prayaas kiya jisamen unhone 1924 kii basant main simit safalataa dilaane vaale teen saptaah kaa upwas karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 Gandhi stayed away from active politics and for most of the 1920s he continued to fill the gap between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress and in addition he waged a movement against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty
 unhone pehle 1928 main laute 
ek saal pehle angreji sarkaar ne sar jon simon ke netritv main ek nayaa samvedhanik sudhaar ayog banaaya jisamen ek bhi sadsy bhartiya nahin tha
 This resulted in a boycott by Indian political parties
 disambar 1928 main gandhi ji ne kalakatta main yojit congress ke ek adhiveshan main ek prastaav rakhaa jisamen bhartiya samrajya ko satta pradaan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha athwa aisa na karne ke badale apane uddeshy ke rup main sampurna desh kii aazaadee ke liye asahyog andolan kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Gandhiji not only fueled the ideas of the youth group like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanding immediate independence but also stopped his own demand for one year instead of two years
 angrejon ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 
no 31 December 1929, the flag of India was hoisted in Lahore

 is samjhaute ke parinamswaroop gandhi ko bhartiya rashtriya congress ke ekmaatr pratinidhi ke rup main landan main yojit hone vaale golmes sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 This conference was a great disappointment for Gandhi and the nationalists, because it was focused on Indian prices and Indian minorities rather than transferring power
 iske alaava, lard irvin ke uttaradhikari lard willington, ne rashtravaadiyon ke andolan ko niyantrit evam kuchalane kaa ek nayaa abhiyaan aarambh karadia
 Gandhi was arrested again and the government tried to prevent his followers from being influenced by Gandhi, keeping him completely away from them
 lekin, yah yukti safal nahin thi
 In 1932, through the campaigning of Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, a Dalit leader and scholar scholar, the government approved separate elections to the untouchables under a new constitution
 iske virodh main dalit haton ke virdohi gandhi ji ne sitambar 1932 main chha: din kaa anshan le liya jisane sarkaar ko safaltaapurvak dalit se rajnatik netaa bane palavankar baaluu dwaara kii gai madhyasta vaali ek samaan vyavastha ko apnaane par bal diya
 Untouchables by Gandhi to improve the lives of the campaign was conducted
 gandhi ji ne in achhuton ko harijan kaa naam diya jinhen ve bhagwaan kii santan maanate the
 On 8 May 1933, Gandhiji undertook a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement
 yah nayaa abhiyaan daliton ko pasand nahin aayaa tathaapi ve ek pramukh netaa bane rahe
 Dr
 Ambedkar categorically condemned Gandhiji's use of the word Harijan, that Dalits are socially immature and that Indians belonging to the privileged caste have played a patriarchal role
 ambedkar or uske sahyogi dalon ko bhi mahasoos hua ki gandhi ji daliton ke raajnneetik adhikaron ko kam aank rahe hai
 Even though Gandhiji was born into a Vaishya caste, he insisted that he could raise his voice for Dalits despite a Dalit Masiha like Dr
 Ambedkar
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke dinon main hindustan kii saamaajik buraaiyon main main chuaachhut ek pramukh buraai thi jiske ke viruddh mahatma gandhi or unke anuyaayi sangharshrat rahete the
 At that time the entry of Harijans into the major temples of the country was completely restricted

 There is an iconic temple here, Guruvayur Temple, in which the statue of Lord Guruvayurappan, showing the form of Lord Krishna, is installed
 aazaadee se purv anya mandiron kii bhaanti is mandir main bhi harijanon ke pravesh par purna pratibandh tha
 The pro-gandhi supporter of Kerala, Mr
 Kelappan, raised his voice against this practice under the orders of the Mahatma and finally civil disobedience was started in 1933

 For this reason, the meeting of the trustees of Guruvayur temple called a meeting and received the opinion of the worshipers of the temple
 baithak me 77 pratishat upasko ke dwaara diye gayi bahumat ke aadhaar par mandir main harijanon ke pravesh ko sweekruti de di gayi or is prakaar 1 janvari 1934 se kerala ke shri guruvayur mandir main kiye gayi nishchay diwas kii safalataa ke rup main harijanon ke pravesh ko saidvantik sweekruti mil gayi

 When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accepted power under the federal scheme, Gandhiji decided to resign from the membership of the party
 vah party ke is kadam se asahmat nahin the kintu mahasoos karte the ki yadi ve istipha dete hai tab bharatiyon ke saath uski lokapriyata party kii sadsyta ko majboot karne main aasaani pradaan karegi jo ab tak communiston, samaajwaadiyon, vyapaar sanghon, chaatro, dharmik netaaon se lekar vyapaar sanghon or vibhinn awaajon ke bich vidyaman thi
 This will give all of them an opportunity to listen to their own words

 Gandhiji returned to India in 1936 with the Lahore session of the Nehru Presidency and Congress
 haalanki gandhi kii purna ichha thi ki ve aazaadee praapt karne par apana sampurna dhyaan kendrit karen na ki bharat ke bhavishya ke bare main atakalon par
 This did not prevent the Congress from adopting socialism as its objective
 1938 main raashtrapati pad ke liye chune gaye subhash bose ke saath gandhi ji ke matbhed the
 Gandhi's main points in differences with Bose were Bose's lack of commitment to democracy and lack of faith in non-violence
 bose ne gandhi ji kii aalochana ke baavjood bhi duusari baar jeet hasil kii kintu congress ko us samay chhod diya jab sabhi bhartiya netaaon ne gandhi ji dwaara lagu kiye gaye sabhi siddhaton kaa parityag kar diya gaya
 When World War II broke out in 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland
 In the beginning, Gandhi favored non-violent moral support to the efforts of the British, but other Congress leaders opposed the unilateral inclusion in the war without consulting the representatives of the public
 did
 congress ke sabhi chaynit sadasyon ne samuhik taur par apane pad se istipha de diya
 After a long discussion, Gandhi declared that India would not be a party to any war if it fought outside for democratic independence when India itself was denied independence
 jaise jaise yuddh badhata gaya gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke liye apni maang ko angrejon ko bharat chodo aandolan naamak vidheyak dekar teevr kar diya
 This was the most obvious rebellion of Gandhi and the Congress Party which was aimed at expelling the British from the Indian border
 gandhi ji ke duusare number par baithe jawaharlal nehru kii party ke kuch sadasyon tathaa kuch anya rajnatik bhartiya dalon ne aalochana kii jo angrejon ke paksh tathaa vipaksh donon main hi vishwaas rakhte the
 Some believed that opposing the British in their lifetime or in the struggle for death was a mortal task while some believed that Gandhiji was not doing enough
 bharat chodo is sangharsh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee andolan ban gaya jisamen vyapak hinsa or giraftaar hui
 Thousands of freedom fighters were either killed or injured by police bullets and thousands were arrested
 gandhi or unke samarthakon ne spasht kar diya ki vah yuddh ke prayaason kaa samarthan tab tak nahin denge tab tak bharat ko tatkaal aazaadee na de di jaae
 He clarified that this time also this movement will not stop if individual acts of violence are materialized
 unhone kaha ki unke chaaron ore araajaktaa kaa aadesh asli araajaktaa se bhi bura he
 He asked all Congressmen and Indians to maintain discipline for ultimate freedom by doing or die with non-violence
 gandhi ji or congress kaaryakaarani samiti ke sabhi sadasyon ko angrejon dwaara mubani main 9 agast 1942 ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Gandhiji was held captive for two years at Agah Khan palace, Pune
 yahi vah samay tha jab gandhi ji ko unke nijee jivan main do gahare aghat lage
 His 50-year-old secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack 6 days later and his wife Kasturba Gandhi died on 22 February 1944 after Gandhiji spent 18 months in jail
 iske chha: saptaah baad gandhi ji ko bhi malaria kaa bhayankar shikaar hona padaa
 He was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 due to his poor health and necessary treatment
 raaj unhen jail main dam todate hue nahin dekhnaa chaahate the jisase desh kaa krodh bad jaae
 Although the Quit India movement was a partial success in its objective, but the stubborn suppression of the movement united India by the end of 1943
 yuddh ke ant main, british ne spasht sanket de diya tha ki santta kaa hastantaran kar use bharatiyon ke haath main somp diya jayega
 At this time Gandhiji stopped the movement, which led to the release of about 100,000 political prisoners including Congress leaders
 gandhi ji ne 1946 main congress ko british kebinet mishan ke prastaav ko thukaraane kaa paraamarsh diya kyoki use muslim bahulata vaale praanton ke liye prastaavit samoohikaran ke prati unka gahan andeh hona tha isliye gandhi ji ne prakaran ko ek vibhaajan ke purvaabhyas ke rup main dekha
 However, for some time, this also became one of the incidents of differences with the Congress with Gandhiji as Nehru and Patel knew that if the Congress did not approve the plan then the control of the government would be passed on to the Muslim League
 1948 ke bich lagbhag 5000 se bhi adhik logon ko hinsa ke dauraan maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Gandhiji was against any such scheme which divided India into two different countries
 bharat main rahane vaale bahut se hinduon or sikhon evam muslimon kaa baari bahumat desh ke bantwaare ke paksh main tha
 Additionally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, introduced extensive cooperation in West Punjab, Sindh, North West Frontier Province and East Bengal
 vyapak str par failane vaale hindu muslim ladaai ko rokane ke liye hi congress netaaon ne bantwaare kii is yojana ko apni manjuuri de di thi
 Congress leaders knew that Gandhiji would oppose Partition and it was impossible for the Congress to move forward without his consent, because Gandhi's support in Partarthy and his position throughout India was strong
 gandhi ji ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne bantwaare ko ek sarvottam upaay ke rup main sweekaar kiya or sardaar patel ne gandhi ji ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki naagarik ashaanti vaale yuddh ko rokane kaa yahi ek upaay he
 Mazabur Gandhi gave his permission
 unhone uttar bharat ke saath-saath bengal main bhi muslim or hindu samudaay ke netaaon ke saath garm ravaiye ko shant karne ke liye gahan vichaar vimarsh kiya
 Despite the india-pakistan war of 1947, he was harassed when the government decided not to give Rs 55 crore to Pakistan as per the agreement made by the Partition Council
 sardaar patel jaise netaaon ko dar tha ki pakistan is dhan kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedane main kar saktaa he
 When the demand arose that all Muslims should be sent to Pakistan and the Muslims and Hindu leaders expressed dissatisfaction on this and Gandhiji was deeply shocked by his refusal to compromise with each other
 unhone dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan aarambh kiya jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko sabhi ke liye tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 55 karod rou0 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and spread violence on the border
 unhen aage bhi dar tha ki hindu or muslim apni shatruta ko phir se nayaa kar denge or usase naagarik yuddh ho jane kii ashanka ban sakati he
 After a passionate debate with allies who had supported Gandhi ja throughout his life, Gandhiji refused to accept the matter and the government had to stick to its policy and make payments to Pakistan
 hindu muslim or sikh samudaay ke netaaon ne unhen vishwaas dilaayaa ki ve hinsa ko bhula kar shanti laaenge
 These communities included the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha

 Gandhi said that the most important battle to be fought is to conquer elements like your demons, fear and insecurity
 
gandhi ji ne apane vichaaron ko sabase pehle us samay sankshep main vyakt kiya jab unhone kaha bhagwaan hi satya he baad main unhone apane is kathan ko satya hi bhagwaan he main badal diya

 Gandhiji spent a lot of time advocating vegetarian food while in London and thereafter
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki shaakaahaari bhojan na keval sharir kii jaruraton ko puraa karata he balki yah aarthik prayojan kii bhi purti karata he jo maance se hoti he or phir bhi maance anaaj, subjiyon or falon se adhik manhagaa hota he

 Their simplicity forced them to abandon the Western lifestyle and they were spreading to South Africa, calling it "bringing themselves to a state of zero", which required unnecessary spending, adopting a simple lifestyle and washing their own clothes

 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature

 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God

 gandhi ke mrityu varsh 1948 main puraskaar is vajah se nahin diya gaya ki koi jivit yogya ummidavaar nahin tha or jab 1989 main dalai lamas ko puraskrit kiya gaya to samiti ke adhyaksh ne yah kaha ki "yah mahatma gandhi kii yaad main shradhanjali kaa hi hissaa he
 " birla bhawan, nai dilli jahaan par 30january, 1948 ko gandhi kii hatya kii gayi kaa adhigrahan bharat sarkaar ne 1971 main kar liya tathaa 1973 main gandhi smriti ke rup main janata ke liye khol diya
 It adorned the room where Gandhi spent his last four months and the ground where he was murdered while going for a night walk
 ek shahid stambh ab us jagah ko chinhit karata hai jahaan par unki hatya kar di gayi thi
 Every year on January 30, Mahatma Gandhi's death anniversary is marked by a school day of non-violence and peace in schools in many countries, a fundamental ground for criticism from the political arena
 niyam ke rup main gandhi vibhaajan kii avadharana ke khilaaf the kyonki yah unke dharmik ekta ke drushtikon ke pratikul thi
 In Harijan on 6 October 1946, he wrote about the partition of India to create Pakistan: jaisaa kii muslim lig dwaara prastut kiya gaya gaiyr-islamic he or main ise paapyukt kehane se nahi hichakoongislam maanav jati ke bhaichaare or ekta ke liye khadaa he, na ki maanav parivaar ke eky kaa avrodh karne ke liye
is vajah se jo yah chaahate hai ki bharat do yuddh ke samoohon main badal jaae ve bharat or islam donon ke dushman hai
 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love
 phir bhi, jaik homer gandhi ke jinna ke saath pakistan ke vishay ko lekar ek lambey patrachaar par dhyaan dete hue kehete hai- "haalaanki gandhi vaiyaktik rup main vibhaajan ke khilaaf the, unhone sahmati kaa suzav diya jiske tahat congress or muslim lig asthaayee sarkaar ke neeche samjhauta karte hue apni aazaadee praapt karen jiske baad vibhaajan ke prashn kaa faisla un jilon ke janamat dwaara hoga jahaan par musalamaanon kii sankhya zyada he
 "
 bharat ke vibhaajan ke vishay ko lekar yah dohari sthiti rakhana, gandhi ne isse hinduon or musalamaanon donon taraf se aalochana ke aayam khol die
 Muhammad Ali Jinnah and contemporary Pakistanis condemned Gandhi for undermining Muslim political rights
 vinayak damodar sawarkaar or unke sahyogiyon ne gandhi kii ninda kii or aarope lagaaya ki ve rajnatik rup se musalamaanon ko manaane main lage hue hai tathaa hinduon par ho rahe atyaachaar ke prati ve laaparvaah hai or pakistan ke nirmaan ke liye sweekruti de di he 
 yah aaj bhi rajnatik rup se vivadaspad he, jaise ki pakistani-amareeki itihaaskaar ayesha jalaal yah tark detii hai ki vibhaajan kii vajah gandhi or congress muslim lig ke saath satta baantne main icchhuk nahin the, dusre masalan hindu rashtravaadi rajaneta praveen togdia bhi gandhi ke is vishay ko lekar netritv kii aalochana karte hai, yah bhi ingit karte hai ki unke hisse kii atyadhik kamajori kii vajah se bharat kaa vibhaajan hua
 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice
 The call of a nation to Jews does not attract me much
 Whose approval was given in the Bible and the insistence with which they started wanting Palestine in their return
 kyon nahi ve, prithvi ke dusre logon se prem karte hai, us desh ko apana ghar banaate jahaan par unka janm hua or jahaan par unhone jivicoparjan kiya
 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct
 jo log hinsa ke jariye aazaadee hasil karnaa chaahate the gandhi unki aalochana ke kaaran bhi thodaa sa rajnatik aag kii lapet main bhi aa gayi bhagat singh, sukhdev, udam singh, raajaguru kii faansee ke kilaaf unka inkaar kuch dalon main unki ninda kaa kaaran bani
 To this criticism, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people used to listen to me how the British could be fought without arms because then there were no weapons
" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa 
 or iske liye main yahudee bhaaiyon kaa intazaar naahe karuunga ki ve aayen or mere vaidhanik pratrodh main mujhase juden, balki mujhe aatmavishvaas hoga ki akhir main sabhi meraa udahaaran maanane ke liye baadhya ho jaayenge
 yahan par jo nuskhaa diya gaya he agar vah ek bhi yahudee yaa saare yahudee sweekaar kar len, to unki sthiti jo aaj he usase badtar nahi hogi
 or agar die gaye peeda ko ve swechhapurvak sah len to vah unhen andruni shakti or anand pradaan karegaa or hitler kii suvichaarit hinsa bhi yahudiyon kii ek saadhaaran nar sanhaar ke rup main nishkarshith ho tathaa yah uske atyaacharon kii ghoshnaa ke khilaaf pehla jawaab hogi
 agar yahudiyon kaa dimag sweyapurvak pidaa sahane ke liye tayar ho, meri kalpana he ki sanhaar kaa din bhi dhanyavad gyaapan or anand ke din main badal jayega jaisaa ki jihova ne gadhaa

 ek atyaachaari ke haath main apni zaati ko dekar kiya
 Those who fear God are not afraid of the terror of death
 gandhi kii in vaktavyon ke kaaran kaafii aalochana huyi jinka jawaab unhone "yahudiyon par prashn" lekh main diya saath main unke mitron ne yahudiyon ko kiye gaye mere apil kii aalochana main samachar patr ki do kartane bhejin do aalochanaayen yah sanket karti hai ki maine jo yahudiyon ke khilaaf hue anyaay kaa upaay bataaya, vah bilkul nayaa nahin he
 


 i only request that if one renounces violence from the heart, then in conclusion it will create a power through practice which is due to great sacrifice
 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both? " gandhi ke dakshin africa ko lekar shuruaati lekh kaaphi vivadaspad hai 7 march, 1908 ko, gandhi ne indian opinian main dakshin africa main unke karagaar jivan ke bare main likhaa "kafir shashan main hi asabhy hai - kaidi ke rup main to or bhi

 "on the subject of immigration in 1903, Gandhi commented that" i believe that as much as they believe in the purity of their caste, we also 


 We believe that the white race in South Africa should be the best caste Should
 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time
 These statements of Gandhi gave him an opportunity to accuse some people of being racist

 At the center of chapter one, "gandhi, African-born Indians in colonial status" which is about the relationship between African and Indian communities in "white supremacy" and the policies that led to the partition, he says, "young Gandhi was influenced in 1890 by the divisive ideas that prevailed at that time
 " saath hi saath ve yah bhi kehete hai, "gandhi ke jail ke anubhav ne unhen un logon ki sthiti ke prati adhik samvedansheel bana diya tha

 " ve jari rakhte hai un vivaadon kaa hawala dete hue jo gandhi ki pratimaa ke anaavaran ke dauraan uthe the
 As a response to these two approaches to Gandhi, Bhana and Vahed argue: They want people to justify Gandhi for his political purpose after apartheid in South Africa
 They ignore some of the facts about him, in part because Don't help much; And those who call him only a racist are equally guilty of misrepresentation / are equally guilty of perversion
 " Gandhi was anti-raj in the form where he had a vision of an India that was not under any government
 unka vichaar tha ki ek desh main sachche swashaasan kaa arth he ki pratyak vyakti khud par shashan karata hai tathaa koi aisa rajya nahin jo logon par kanoon lagu kar sake
 On some occasions he has called himself a philosophical anarchist
 In his sense, an independent India exists with thousands of small self-sufficient communities that rule on their own without the hurdle of others

 vir loric, purvi uttar pradesh kii ahir jati kii dantakatha kaa ek divya charitra he
 SM Pandey has called it the national epic of the Ahir farming class of India
 lorikayan, yaa loric kii katha, bhojpuri bhashaa kii ek niti katha he
 It is given the status of Ramayana of Ahir caste
 loriki main kai chote chote rajyo jo ki-ahir, rajput or adivasaiyo ke he or in logo main praayah pashudhan, bhoomidhan, stridhan tathaa shakti pradarshan ke liye yuddh hote hai
 In this, Ahir is described as a biracial warrior, for whom kidnapping is a custom for marriage and is considered valuable in showing strength, valor, loyalty, ideal and honor
 duusare lok mahakavyon main darshit reeti ke anuroop hi, yah kavy ke mahanayake loric ke jivan par kendrit he
 There are several local versions on a regional basis on the context of Loriki, which the rural Ahirs see as the history of their caste as it contains many customs prevalent in their caste
 loric ko aitihaasik mahanayake va ahiro ke mahaan purvaj ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The story revolves around the incidents of family protests, social disdain and escape faced by Lorik due to the love affair of married Rajput princess Chanda and an Ahir Lorik
 hindi ke lok sahitya main loric va chanda kii kathao kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The stories of Lorik and Chanda have been recorded in Hindi literature since before the 14th century
 'chandaayan' naamak pratham hindvi prem kavy likhane ke liye, sufi kavi moulana daaud ne 1379 main loric or chanda ke lok mahagranth ko chunaa tha
 Maulana believed that 'chandayan' is a divine truth and its shruti are equivalent to the verses of the Quran
 
 Lorik - Katha has also been mentioned by Elliot and he has given an authentic history of Ahir caste in this context
 loric kii katha maatr lok katha hi nahin he, apitu is par aadhaarit saahitiyik kritiyaan bhi vidyaman hai

 ganit main, kramchay kii sankalpana ko sookshm rup se vibhinn arthon main prayog kiya jaataa he, sabhi arth vastuon yaa mulya ke kramparivartan kii karrwai se sambandhit hai
 Informally, permutation is to arrange a set of some values in a particular order
 is prakaar set ke chah kramchay hai arthath, ,, , or 
 In algebra and especially in group theory, the permutation of a set s is defined as the bisection of s from itself
 For such a map, f is related to the rearrangement of s in which the s element replaces its image f
 combinetorics main, parimit set s kaa kramchay iske tatwon kii soochibaddh punarvyavastha ke rup main paribhaashit he
 In this sense, the permutation of s is different from the rearrangement of its elements
 praarambhik kram vaale set s ke liye, jaise s =, ye dono arth lagbhag pahachaane ja sakate hai: is praarambhik aadesh par pehle arth main kramparivartan lagu karne se tatwon kaa vaikalpik kram praapt hota he, jo duusare arth main kramparivartan he
 The term permutation is used informally to designate the function of the rearrangement of parts of an object, or the result derived from it
 is prakaar kisi shabd ke varnaviparyay ko iske varno kaa kramparivartan ke rup main bhi paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, yaa kah len ki x 3Y +7+Y 2Z bahupadiy x 3Y +Y 2Z +7 ke padon kaa kramparivartan he
 The function of a permutation can also be called a substitution of symbols, for example when say that a permutation of a variable amount of X, Y, z is obtained from x 3Y + y 2Z +7 to y 3Z + z 2X +7
 ek upyukt samametiya samuhik karrwai ko dhyaan main rakhte hue in kathanon ko sateek arth pradaan kiya ja saktaa he In combinatorics the second meaning of "permutation" is sometimes expanded
 praathmik combinetorics main, "kramparivartan or sangyojan" do sambhddha samasyaon kaa hawala detaa he, donon hi n tatv ke set se vishisht k tatv ke chayan kii sambhaavnaaon par nirbhar karti hai, k kramparivartan ke liye chayan ke kram ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he, kintu k -sangyojan ke liye andekha kar diya jaataa he
 Actually the calculation of k-permutation is used as a step towards the calculation of the number { \ displaystyle { \ tbinom {n} {k}}} of the k-combination and the number of permutations of the set n! Is also calculated as tathaapi k -kramparivartan aise kramparivartan ke tab tak anuroop nahin hote jab tak k = n, arthath, chayan main sabhi uplabdh tatv shaamil na hon
 kramparivartan kii dharna ko bhinn tareeke se vyapak banane ke liye, ek setrush ke sthaan par, aise parimit multiset m ke saath shuruyaat kii ja sakati he, jisamen kuch mulya ek se adhik baar ghatit hote hon

 is prakaar m = ke liye, kaa anukram m kaa multiset kramparivartan he, kintu nahin he
 In almost every area of mathematics, permutations occur more or less prominently
 kisi parimit set par bhinn kram lagu kiye jane se ve utpann hote hai, sambhawatah kyonki aise kram ko andekha karte hue ham pataa lagaana chaahate hai ki is prakaar kitne vinyason kii pahchaan hoti he
 For similar reasons, permutation occurs in the study of sorting calculus mathematics in computer science
 bijganit main, samametiya samooh kii sankalpana ke madhyam se kramparivartan kaa vistrut adhyayan karne ke liye ek sampurna vishay samarpit kiya gaya he
 Important to its structure is the possibility of constructing a permutation: the combination defines the third rearrangement, executing two rearrangements in subsequent order

 The development of this work resulted in Galois theory, through the work of Ivaris Galva, which gives a complete description of what is possible and impossible in solving polynomial equations by origin
 aadhunik ganit main isi tarah kii kai sthitiyaan hai, jahaan samasya ko samajhane ke liye sambandhit kramparivartan ke adhyayan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The concept of permutation is used in the following contexts
 samooh siddhant or sambandhit kshetron main, yadrichhik seton, aparimit kaa bhi kramparivartan hota he
 s is itself a permutation of the bisector set s in itself
 yah kramparivartan kii anumati detaa he, jo kramparivartan ke samoohon ko paribhaashit karata he
 If s is a finite set of n elements, then n! Is a permutation of s
 combinetorics main, ek kramparivartan kaa arth aam taur par ek parimit set se ek baar or keval ek baar prayek tatv se yukt anukram samajha jaataa he
 The concept of a sequence differs from the set in that it contains elements of a sequence in order: the first element of the sequence is the second element and so on
 iske vipareet, set main tatwon kaa koi kram nahin hota, or ek hi set ko nirupit karne ke alag tareeke hai
 In this sense, a permutation of a finite s set of n elements is equivalent to a bisection in S, or selection for the entire sequence of S
 is arth main n ! kramparivartan bhi s kaa he
 The term "permutation" also has a weak meaning that is sometimes used in primary combinatorics texts, naming sequences in which no element appears more than once, but does not require the use of all elements of a defined set
 Lying
 In fact its use often requires considering the order of fixed length k of elements taken from a set of size n> k { \ displaystyle n> k}
 in vastuon ko bina doharaav ke kram ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, aisa shabd jisase "kramparivartan" ke duusare, aam arthon ke bhram se bachaa jaataa he
 The number of lengths of the order k without repetitions of elements of a set of n sizes is ek sankhya jise n kii k -th hrasaatmak bhajya shakti ke rup main janaa jaataa he or jiske kain duusare naam or ankan prachlit hai
 If m is a finite multiset, then a multiset permutation is the sequence of m elements in which each element appears as many times as m has its plurality
 yadi m ke tatwon kii bahulata m 1 { \ displaystyle m_{1}}, m 2 { \ displaystyle m_{2}}, 


, m l { \ displaystyle m_{l}} he or unka yoga n he, to m ke multiset kramparivartan kii sankhya bahupadiy gunank dwaara di jaati he In group theory, a permutation of a set means a bipartite map, or a bisector from that set itself
 All permutations of any set s form a structure group as the product of the map and the neutral element of the identity
 yah s kaa samametiya samooh he
 As for symmetry, it depends on the countability of the isometric group set, so the nature of the s elements is irrelevant to the structure of the group
 parimit seton ke maamle main samametiya samoohon kaa adhyayan sabase adhik kiya gaya he, jis maamle main yah mana ja saktaa he ki s ={1,2,


,{0}n} kuch prakritik sankhya n ke liye, jo n kii degree ke samametiya samooh ko paribhaashit karata he
 Any subgroup of a symmetric group is called a permutation group
 vastav main keli ke sutara ke anusaar koi bhi samooh kramparivartan samooh ke anuroop he or prayek parimit samooh kisi bhi parimit samametiya samooh kaa upasamooh he
 However, permutation groups have more structure than abstract permutation groups and have different realizations as permutation groups so do not have to be equivalent
 ek parimit s set ke kramparivartan ke liye do mukhya ankan paddatiyaan hai
 In two-line notation, one lists the element of s in the first row and its image in the second row under the permutation for each
 For example, a special permutation of a set can be written as: iskaa matlab he ki σ santusht karata he σ =2,σ =5, σ =4,σ =3 orσ =1
 Alternatively, we can write a permutation using cycle notation, which focuses on the effect of a successful use of a permutation
 yah kramparivartan ko chakra ke utpaada ke rup main vyakt karti he jo kramparivartan kii kakshaon ke anuroop hota he; chunki pruthak kakshaen shithil hoti hai, ise saamaanya rup se kramparivartan kaa "shithil chakron main apghaton" kehete hai
 It works like this: starting from some x element of S, σ ≠ x, write the sequence σ of the serial object under σ) 


), until the image becomes X, at which point the brackets are closed
 Huh
 likhe gaye maan kaa set x kii kaksha banaata he or koshthakbaddh abhivyakti σ kaa samaanuroop chakra detii he
 So it continues to select the x element of s that is not in the class already written and that σ ≠ y writes the corresponding cycle and this sequence continues until all elements of s are associated with the written cycle or σ does not have fixed points
 Since the starting point for each new cycle can be chosen in different ways, there are usually many different cycle notations for the same permutation; For example, the one above has an example σ kaa har chakra apane aap main ek kramparivartan kaa pratik he, arthath jo is kaksha main σ ke sam mulya letaa he, s ke sabhi tatwon ko swany main chitrit karte hue
 kaksha ke l aakaar ko chakra kii lambaai kaha jaataa he
 The discrete orbitals of σ are by definition relaxed, so the corresponding cycles are transformed and σ is the product of its cycles
 Hence the combination of cycles in cycle notation can be interpreted as marking the structure of the permutation, which is why the permutation is named "decomposition"
 This decomposition is essentially unique: other than the reorder of cycles in the product, there is no way to write σ as the product of cycles whose orbitals are relaxed
 The cycle notation is less unique because each cycle can be written in different ways, as in the example above where it represents the cycle but will represent a different permutation)
 aakaar 1 kii ek kaksha kaa tadnurupi chakra nahin he, chunki yah kramparivartan x or saath hi s ke har anya tatv ko thik karegaa, duusare shabdon main yah pahchaan hogi, x se swatantra rup main
 yah sambhav he chakra ankan main shaamil karen taaki σ bal de ki σ x ko tay karata he, par yah σ ke apghaton main kaarak ke anuroop nahin he
 If the concept of "cycle" includes the identification of permutations, it will destroy the uniqueness of the decomposition of permutations into loose cycles
 The decomposition of the identity permutation into loose cycles is the empty product; Its cycle notation will be empty, so a marking method like e will be used instead
 lambaai ke do chakron ko pratisthaapan kaha jaataa he; aise kramparivartan keval do tatwon kii jagah badalte hai
 The product of two permutations is defined as their structure as a function, in other words σ · π is the function that depicts any x element of the set in σ)
 dhyaan den ki kaary kaa anuprayog likhane ke dhang kii vajah se sabase daayan kramparivartan pehle tark par lagu hota he
 Some authors prefer to apply the leftmost factor first, but for that the permutation must be written to the right of their argument, for example as the exponent, σ x σ is applied to x; So the product is defined by x σ · π = π
 While this gives a different rule for multiplying permutations; This article uses the definition where the rightmost permutation is first applied
 chunki do dvibhajanon kii sanrachana hameshaa ek or dvibhajan detii he, do kramparivartan kaa utpaada phir se ek kramparivartan he
 The work structure is collaborative, so the product operation on the permutation is: · ρ = σ ·
 Therefore the products of the permutation are usually written without parentheses and they are also usually written without a dot or other mark marking the product
 pahchaan kramparivartan, jo set ke prayek tatv ko swany main hi chitrit karata he, is utpaada kaa tatasth tatv he
 In two-line notation, the identity is chunki dvibhajan ke vyutkram hai, isliye kramparivartan ke bhi hai or σ kaa vyutkram σ −1he jo phir se ek kramparivartan he
 Clearly, whenever σ = y is also σ −1 = x of one
 do panktiyon vaale ankan main vyutkram do linon ko paraspar badal kar praapt kiya ja saktaa he udhaaharan ke liye By reversing the order of the elements in each cycle in cycle notation, one can obtain cycle notation for its inverse
 ek sahyogaatmak utpaada, ek tatasth tatv or iske sabhi tatwon ke liye vyutkram se s ke sabhi kramparivartan ke set kaa samooh banaata he jise s kaa samametiya samooh kaha jaataa he
 Each permutation of a finite set can be expressed as the product of the substitution
 iske alaava, haalanki ek die gaye kramparivartan ke liye kai tarah ke bhav maujuud ho sakate hai, unke bich pratisthaapan kii sam sankhya or visham sankhya donon bhav ke saath abhivyakti nahin ho sakati
 sabhi kramparivartan sam yaa visham rup main vargeekrut hai, kisi bhi abhivyakti main unke pratisthaapan kii samta ke anusaar
 The method of multiplying permutations written in cycle notation is difficult and the product cycles can be completely different from the permutations being structured
 haalanki chakra sanrachana sangrakshit he σ ke kramparivartan ke anya kramparivartan π ke sanyugma ke vishesh maamle main, jiskaa arth he utpaada π·σ·π −1 kaa nirmaan
 yahan parinaam kaa chakra ankan praapt kiya ja saktaa he σ kaa chakra ankan lekar uski sabhi pravishtiyon main π lagu kar
 The permutation of {1, 2, 


, {0} n} can be represented as an n × n matrix
 aisa karne ke do prakritik tareeke hai, lekin keval ek ke liye hi matrix kaa guna usee kram main kramparivartan ke guna ke anuroop hota he: yahi he jo σ matrix m kaa sahyogi he jisaki m i, j pravishti 1 he yadi i=σ he anyathaa 0

 is tarah ke matrix ko kramparivartan matrix kehete hai
 a permutation of a set s with n elements in combinatorics is a list of elements of s in a sequence
 ise set se s main aupchaarik dvibhajan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Note that if s is equal to, this definition matches the definition of group theory
 aamtaur par ke bajaae tatwon ke kram se susajjit kisi bhi set kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 The property of combinatorics that is related to the group theoretical interpretation of permutations and which can be defined without using the total order of s is the cycle structure of the permutation σ
 yah n ke chakron kii lambaai kaa varnan karte hue σ kaa vibhaajan he
 Here for every fixed point of σ there is part "1" in the division
 ek kramparivartan jiskaa koi nishchit bindu nahin he use avyavashtha kaha jaataa he
 The properties of other combinatorics are directly related to the order of s and the way the permutation is related to it
 There are many such qualities
 n ke σ ke kramparivartan kaa aaroh i σ i +1, isliye 1 ≤ i { \ displaystyle 1 \ leq i} ke saath prayek i yaa to σ kaa aaroh he yaa avaroh
 The number of permutations of n with k mount is the Eulerian number ⟨nk⟩ { \ displaystyle \ textstyle \ left \ langle {n \ atop k} \ right \ rangle}, also the number of permutations of n with k mount

 For example, the ascending runs of the permutations 2453167 are 245, 3 and 167, while it has an incremental result of 2367
 agar ek kramparivartan ke k − 1 avarohi ran hai, to yah k arohi ran kaa sangh hona chahie
 isliye n kaa kramparivartan k arohi ran ke saath vahi he jo k − 1 arohi ke saath kramparivartan kii sankhya ⟨ n k − 1 ⟩ { \ displaystyle \ textstyle \ left \ langle {n \ atop k-1} \ right \ rangle } kaa he
 a permutation is a pair of inverse positions of σ in which the entries of the permutation are in the reverse order: i { \ displaystyle i} and σ i> σ j { \ displaystyle \ sigma _ {i}> \ sigma _ {j}}
 So a descending is just an inverse at two adjacent positions
 udhaaharan ke liye, kramparivartan σ = 23154 ke teen vyutkram hai:,, , pravishtiyon ke jode, , ke liye
 Sometimes an inverse is defined as a pair of values whose order is reversed, it does not make any difference to the number of inversions and this addition is also the inverse of the σ −1 inverse permutation in the above sense
 vyutkram kii sankhya degree ke liye ek mahatvapurn upaay he jiske liye kramparivartan kii pravishtiyaan kram se baahar hai, σ or σ −1 ke liye vahi he
 To arrange a permutation with k inverse, it is always possible to apply adjacent substitutions sequentially and require a k sequence of such operations

 The number of permutations of n with k inverse is expressed by the Mahonian number, this is the coefficient of x k in the product expansion

 Representation of the permutation of n 0 ≤ n <n! With n can be done by integers, provided that convenient methods are provided for the commutation between the number and the normal representation of the permutation as a sequence

 For the permutation σ in the Lehmer code, the number dn represents the choice made for the first term σ 1, the number dn −1 represents the choice made between the remaining n - 1 elements of the set for the second term σ 1 and Similarly even further
 And frankly, each dn + 1 − i gives the number of remaining elements which is definitely less than the term σ i
 chunki ve shesh tatv kisi pasch pad σ j ke rup main aane ke liye baadhya hai, ank d n +1−i vyutkramon kii ginati i ko chote suchakank ke rup main shaamil karke karata he

 The Lehmer code lists the number of crosses in successive rows, while the inverse table lists the number of crosses in successive columns; Is the Lehmer code for the inverse permutation and the inverse permutation for the Lehmer code
 lehmar code d n, d n −1, 


, d 2, d 1 ko ek vyavasthit s set ke kramparivartan main prabhavi rup se parivartit karne ke liye, vardhman kram main s ke tatwon kii suchi ke saath shuru kar sakate hai or i ke liye 1 se n set σ i se soochibaddh tatwon se badhayen jisamen anya d n +1−i pehle ghatit hon or us tatv ko suchi se nikaal den

 Successive changes in the factorial number system of successive natural numbers generate these sequences in lexical order, and converting them to further permutations preserves radix order provided that the interpretation of the Lehmer code is used to represent the number in the factorial number system
 The sum gives the number of inversions of the permutation and the sum of the equations is Permutation get the marker
 iske atirikt vyutkram talika main shunya kii sthiti kramparivartan kii baayen-se-daaen mahattam kaa mulya detii he jabaki lehmar code main shunya kii sthiti daaen-se-baayen laghutam kii sthiti he ; isse sabhi kramparivartanon main aise antim ke vitaran kii computing hoti he

 computing main die gaye mulyon ke anukram kaa kramparivartan utpann karne kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 The most useful method of doing this depends on whether some, randomly chosen, permutation, or all permutations are expected and in the latter case if a specific order is required
 ek or prashn he ki kya die gaye anukram main pravishtiyon ke bich sambhavya samanta ko dhyaan main rakhaa janaa he; agar aisa he to anukram ke vishisht multiset kramparivartan hi utpann kiye jane chahie
 An obvious way to generate permutations of n is to generate values for Lehmer code and convert them into homogeneous permutations
 However, the latter step, although obvious, is difficult to implement efficiently because it requires n operations and deletions of each selection in a sequence to be a direct representation of a sequence, at a random position, as a table or a serialized list; The change requires approximately n 2 / 4 operations for both
 n ke vishesh rup se chote hone kii sambhaavna se adhik samasya nahin he, lekin yah pataa chalaa he ki yadrichhik or vyavasthit donon utpaadan ke liye saral vikalp uplabdh hai jo zyaada kargar hote hai
 For this reason it does not seem useful, although it is certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that can convert o time to Lehmer code permutation
 die gaye n mulyon ke anukram ke yadrichhik kramparivartan paidaa karne ke liye isse koi antar nahin padataa ki kram par n kaa yadrichhik rup se chunaa gaya anukram lagu kiya jaae yaa kram ke vishisht kramparivartanon main se ek yadrichhik tatv kaa chunaav kiya jaae
 iskaa kaaran yah he, yadhyapi aavarti mulyon ke maamle main n ke aise vishisht kramparivartan ho sakate hai jinase vahi kramparivartit anukram praapt hon, prayek sambhav parinaam ke liye aise kramparivartan kii sankhya ek hi he
 Unlike the streamlined production which n! Due to the evolution of the number becomes impractical for large n, there is no reason to assume that n will be small for random production
 yadrichhik kramparivartan utpann karne kaa moolbhoot vichaar yadrichhik rup se ek n ! anukram jo purnank d 1,d 2,


,d n kaa ho, kaa santoshjanak0 ≤ di < i utpaadan karnaa he or dwibhajit saadrishyata ke madhyam se ise ek kramparivartan main parivartit karnaa he
 For the latter analogy, the sequence can be interpreted as the Lehmer code and derives from the method of production that Ronald A
W
 First published in 1938 by Fisher and Frank Yates
 us samay computer karyanvayan koi mudda nahin tha, is vidhi se lehmar code se kramparivartan main dakshata se parivartan karne main upar rekhachitrit kathinaayee aati he
 This can be solved by using a different bifurcation analogy: from the remaining i elements of the sequence, after using di instead of selecting the element, instead of removing the element and moving the elements one place, making the sequence narrower
 Replaces the last remaining element
 is prakaar chayan ke liye shesh tatv samay main prayek bindu par ek kramagat range banaate hai, bhale hi ve usee kram main nahin hote jaise ki ve mul anukram main the
 The mapping of permutations from a sequence of integers is somewhat complex, but it can be seen to generate each permutation in exactly one way by instantiation
 jab chaynit tatv antim shesh tatv ho, pratisthaapan sankriya ko choda ja saktaa he
 It is not so often that the test of conditions is justified, but the final element must be included in the selection of candidates to guarantee that all permutations can be generated

 Permutations are used in interlever components in error detection and correction of algorithm arithmetic such as turbo code, for example 3GPP Long Term Evolution Mobile Telecommunications Standard uses these ideas
 Such applications allow for quick production of permutations with desirable properties
