 abhikalp yaa dizin shabd kaa upyog prayukt kalaon, abhiyantriki, vaastushilp evam isi tarah ke anya srujanaatmak kaaryon evam kshetron main kiya jaataa he
 It is used as a verb and as a noun
 kriya ke rup main dizin kaa arth us prakriya se he jo kisi utpaada, dhaancha, tantra yaa saamaan ko astitv main laane yaa uske vikaas ke liye apanaayi jaati he
 The word design as a noun is used in two meanings - aajkal prakriyaayonko bhi dizin kaa parinaam mana jaataa he
 Process design is used in this sense
 dizin ke antargat bahut se lakshya nirdhaarit kiye gayi hote hai
 Among these, the main requirements are - work related, size and volume, price or cost related, power requirement, maintenance and improvement related to deterioration, ease of interconnecting different parts, ease of manufacture and production etc
 abhiklpana kisi purvanishchit dhyey kii uplabdhi ke liye tatsambandhi vichaaron evam anya sabhi sahaayak vastuon ko krambaddh rup se suvyavasthit kar dena hi 'abhiklpana' he
 Architects plan the construction of a building by marking the lines in various forms, thinking of the accomplishment of a single goal
 kalakaar bhi rekhaon ke sangyojan se chitra main ek vishesh prabhaav yaa vichaar upasthit karne kaa praytn karata he
 Similarly, the building engineer assigns various measurements to a building to ensure its durability and firmness
 sabhi baaten abhiklpana ke antargat hai
 It is the duty of the architect to present a viable design that is convenient and economical in the goal of building construction
 saath hi use yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki imaarat kaa aakaar us kshetra ke pados ke anukool ho or apane id-gird khadi puraani imaaraton ke saath bhi uskaa mail baith sake
 Suppose all the houses around Eid are arched doorways, then a flat stop between them will not suit the flat-faced house
 isi tarah or bhi kai baaten hai jinka vichaar parshvavarti vaataavaran ko drushti main rakhte hue kiya janaa chahie
 The second special thing that is considered for the architect is the decision of a stable opinion about the exterior shape of the building
 vah aisa hona chahie ki ek raah chalata vyakti bhi bhawan ko dekhakar puche bina yah samaj le ki vah bhawan kisalie bana he
 For example, a college should not look like a hospital, nor should the shape of a hospital be like a college
 banks kaa bhawan dekhne main pusht or surakshit laganaa chahie or naatakghar yaa cinemaghar kaa bahari drishy shobhaneey hona chahie
 The architect should be sure that he has made full use of the entire area on which he has to build the building
 kalapurna abhiklpanaaon ke antargat manoranjan athwa rangamanch ke liye parde rangnaa, alankaran ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke chitrankan, kisi vishesh vichaar ko abhivyakt karne ke liye bhittichitra bananaa aadi kaary bhi aate hai
 The quality of the artist is to give real shape to his design
 chitra ko kalakaar ke vichaaron kii sajiv abhivyakti kaa pratik hona chahie
 According to the requirement of the painting, the artist made pencil sketches, oil paintings, watercolor paintings etc
 imaaraton ke ejeeniyar ko vaastuvid kii abhiklpana ke anusaar hi apni abhiklpana aisi banani hoti he ki imaarat apane par padanevaale sab bhaaron ko sanbhaalane ke liye yathesht pusht ho
 With this in view, he selects the specific equipment for construction and orders the installation of such construction material so as to make the building affordable and durable
 iske liye is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he ki nirmaan ke liye sujhaaye gaye vishisht padaarth bazaar main uplabdh hai yaa nahin, athwa sujhai gai vishisht kaaryastylee ko karyanvit karne ke liye abhisht dakshata kaa abhaav to nahin he
 In estimating the weight, the weight of the building itself, its moving load when it is being built or used, the impact of shock of moving loads, wind pressure, the result of earthquake bumps, heating, shrinkage, foundation seating etc
 Have to keep in mind
 inamen se kuch bhaaron kii gananaa to sookshmata se kii jaae sakati he, kintu kai aise bhi hai jinhen vigat anubhavon ke aadhaar par keval anumaanit kiya ja saktaa he
 Take the force of an earthquake --- it is very difficult to estimate and there can be no preconception of how much force and where the earthquake will occur
 tathaapi saubhagyavash adhiktar chal or achal bhaaron ke prabhaav kii gananaa bahut kuch thik-thik kii ja sakati he
 Adequate correct estimation of heat and shrinkage pressure can also be done by studying the interference in the heat of the entire cycle cycle and the known properties of concrete
 hawa evam bukamp ke kaaran padanevaale bal antatogatva anishchit hi hote hai, parantu unki maatra ke anumaan main thodi truti rahane se praaia: haani nahin hoti
 The construction material is generally confirmed so that even if there is a 33 percent increase in the forces of pressure, there is no possibility of any loss
 neenv ke dhansane kaa acha anumaan neeche kii bhoomi kii upyukt jaanch se ho jaataa he
 Each designer also has to take into account some unknown facts, such as the inability of the craftsmen, the burden of unthinkable crowds of people at some time, the hidden potential weaknesses of the substances used, etc
 in tathyon ko 'surakshagunak' ke antargat rakhaa jaataa he, jo ispaat ke liye 2 se 1 / 2 or kancreet, shateer tathaa anya upkarnon ke liye 3 se 4 tak mana jaataa he
 The safety factor should not be used as an excuse to carry additional load on the building
 yah keval agyaat kaarnon ke liye he or ek seemaa tak hraas ke liye bhi, jo bhavishya main bhawan ko dhakke, jarjarata evam mausam kii anischitataayen sahan karne ke liye sahaayak siddh ho saktaa he

 a major cause of the 1857 rebellion was the economic exploitation of Indians by the company
 company kii nitiyon ne bharat kii parmparik arthvyavastha ko puri tarah se samaapt kar diya tha
 Due to these policies, many farmers, artisans, laborers and artists became poor
 inke saath saath jameendaaron or bade kisaanon kii sthiti bhi badtar ho gayi
 In 1813, the company adopted a policy of one-way free trade, under which British traders were allowed to import completely, Indian goods made with traditional technology could not stand in front of it and the Indian urban handicrafts trade suffered unimaginable damage

 Artificial intelligence began in the 1950s

 vah chiraag ko ishani ke liye sahi sochataa he
 He wants to reunite Ishaani and Chirag, but only in Chirag's first meeting, a face of dirty thinking and thinking for himself is revealed
 iske baad ranvir chiraag kii ishani se dosti karwaane main madad karata he
 But soon Ranveer comes to know Chirag's truth that he is marrying Ishani for money only
 chiraag kahata he ki use pataa he ki vah ishani se pyaar karata he
 Chirag then implores Ranveer through Ishaani's sister Disha

 Ranveer turns from poor to a rich man
 jabaki ishani ke pita ke mrityu ke pashchaat uskaa parivaar garib ho jaataa he or vah ek jagah naukari karti he
 Ranveer buys Ishani's old house and the company where he works now
 chiraag abhi bhi ishani ke prakaran ke jeetne ke baad uske paise lekar bhaagane kii firaaq main rahata he
 So he keeps waiting

 But Ishani runs away from there
 use ehsaas hota he ki vah ranvir se pyaar karti he
 Chirag sends Ranveer the Ishani and some fake images of himself
 jise dekh kar ranvir ke man main ishani ke khilaaf keval krodh bhar rah jaataa he
 While Ishani now falls in love with Ranveer
 ranvir jo ab bhi ishani se pyaar karata he vah is baat ko nahin maanata or apane pyaar kaa izhaar kar detaa he
 But Ishaani's Amba and Ba ask them to separate

 Meanwhile, Chirag is killed
 ishani ko lagata he ki yah hatya ranvir ne kii he
 While he is innocent

 Because she is already going to be the mother of someone else's child
 sharmaan ko lagata he ki is bachche kaa pita vah nahin balki ranvir he
 Ranveer and Ritika live together, their friend Shikhar Mehta fights and wins the episode of Ishaani
 vah ishani ko nirdosh sabit kar detaa he
 Ranveer does not get the news of his removal from jail

 Ranveer is happy to see Ishaani
 lekin ishani ko lagata he ki ranvir ne reetika se shaadi kar lee he
 She too agrees to marry Shikhar
 tabhi is baat kaa sabhi ko pataa chalata he ki ranvir or reetika kii shaadi nahin hui he
 Ranveer keeps his and Ritika's wedding on the same day as Ishani and Shikhar
 ishani apane maan ke hatya ke prakaran ko punah khulawaati he
 Someone tries to kill Ishaani

 Although India does not have an international obligation for such a legislator, the Bill is required to invite American companies General Motor and Westing House to do business in the region
 is vidheyak se ye companiyaan apane desh main beemaa kaa paisa le sakenge
 Therefore, this bill and legislation are necessary for the implementation of the indo-us nuclear deal

 On the other hand, the Bill also contains provisions that largely relieve nuclear material suppliers and operators from liability
