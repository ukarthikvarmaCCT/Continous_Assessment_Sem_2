 Dengue fever is an infection caused by the dengue virus
 dengue kaa ilaaj samay par karnaa bahut jaruri hota hai
 machhar dengue virus ko sancharit karte hai
 Dengue fever is also known as "bone fracture", because it can cause so much pain to the people who have broken their bones
 dengue bukaar ke kuch lakshanon main bukhaar; sirdard; twachaa par chechak jaise laal chakatte tathaa mansapeshiyon or jodon main dard shaamil hai
 In some people, dengue fever can occur in one or two forms that can be life-threatening
 pehla, dengue rakthasravi bukaar he, jiske kaaran rakt vahikaaon, main raktasrav yaa risaav hota he tathaa rakt platelets kaa str kam hota he
 The second is dengue shock syndrome, which leads to dangerously low blood pressure
 dengue virus chaar bhinn-bhinn prakaaron ke hote hai
 If a person gets an infection from one of these types of viruses, then usually he is protected from that type of dengue virus throughout his life
 halanki baaki ke teen prakaaron se vah kuch samay ke liye hi surakshit rahata he
 If he is infected with one of these three types of virus, then he is more likely to have serious problems
 logon ko dengue virus se bachaane ke liye koi vaxin uplabdh nahin he
 There are some measures that should be taken to save people from dengue fever
 log apane ko machharon se bachaa sakate hai tathaa unase kaate jane kii sankhya ko simit kar sakate hai
 Scientists say that mosquitoes can grow and shrink
 yadi kisi ko dengue bukaar ho jaay to vah aamtaur par apni beemaari ke kam yaa simit hone tak paryaapt taral pikar thik ho saktaa he
 If the person's condition is more serious, he may need intravenous or blood transfusion
 1960 se, kaaphi log dengue bukaar se peedit ho rahe hai
 The disease has become a worldwide problem since World War II
 yah 110 deshon main aam he
 Each year around 50–100 million people suffer from dengue fever
 virus kaa pratyaksh upachaar karne ke liye log vaxin tathaa dawaaon par kaam kar rahe hai
 People also take many different measures to get rid of mosquitoes
 dengue bukaar kaa pehla varnan 1779 main likhaa gaya tha
 In the early 20th century, scientists learned that the disease is caused by the dengue virus and it is transmitted through mosquitoes
 dengue ko kai varshon purv sabase pehle likhaa gaya tha
 The Jin Encyclopedia of Chinese Medicine speaks of a person who may have had dengue
 kitaab ek "jal jehar " rog ke bare main bataata he jiskaa sambandh udne vaale kiton se tha
 Written documents from the 17th century also discuss an epidemic that may be dengue
 sabase adhik sambhavit dengue mahamari kii aarambhik report 1779 tathaa 1780 kii he
 These reports speak of an epidemic that engulfed Asia, Africa and North America
 us samay se 1940 tak bahut sari mahamariyaan nahin hui
 In 1906, scientists proved that people were getting infected with "aedes" mosquitoes
 1907 main vaigyanikon ne darshaya ki dengue kaa kaaran virus he
 This was only the second disease that was shown to be caused by the virus
 jon bartan clayland tathaa joseph franklin siller dengue ke virus kaa adhyayan karte rahe or virus ke vistaar ke aadhaar kaa pataa lagaaya
 Dengue started spreading more rapidly after the second world war
 mana gaya ki yuddh ne paryaavaran ko kai tareeko se badla
 Different types of dengue spread to new areas
 logo ko pehali baar rakthasravi dengue bukhaar hona shuru hua
 This horrific type of Daegu was first reported in the Philippines in 1953
 1970 ke aate-aate rakthasravi dengue bukhaar bacchon main mrityu kaa pramukh kaaran ban gaya
 It started happening in the Pacific region and also in America
 rakthasravi dengue bukhaar tathaa dengue shock syndrome sabase pehle madhya tathaa dakshin america main 1981 main report kiya gaya
 At this time healthcare professionals noticed that those who had been affected by the type 1 dengue virus were being affected by the type 2 dengue virus after a few years
 yah spasht nahin he ki shabd "dengue" kahaan se aayaa
 Some people believe that the word came from the Swahili phrase ka-dinga pepo
 yah vaakyansh buree atmaaon se hone vaali beemaari ke bare main bataata he
 The Swahili word dinga is believed to be derived from the Spanish word dengue
 is shabd kaa arth he "saavdhaan"
 The term may have been used to refer to a person who suffers from bone pain of dengue fever; That pain would force the person to walk with caution
 halanki, yah bhi sambhav he ki spani shabd swahili bhashaa se aayaa ho, na ki jaisaa upar bataaya gaya he
 Others believe that the name "dengue" came from the West Indies
 west indies main, dengue se peedit gulam "e dendi" kii tarah khadey hone vaale or chalane vaale kahe jate the or isi kaaran se beemaari ko bhi "dendi fever" kaha jaataa tha
 The name "bone-breaking fever" was first used by the United States "founding father" Benjamin Rush, a physician
 1789 main rash ne "haddi-tod bukhaar " naam kaa upyog ek report main kiya jo 1780 main philadelphia main huye dengue ke prakope par thi
 In the report, Rush used the more formal name "billius Remitting Fever"
 shabd "dengue bukhaar" 1828 tak aam taur par upyog main nahin tha
 Earlier, different people used different names for the disease
 udhaaharan ke liye dengue ko "brikeheart fever" tathaa "laa dengue" bhi kaha jaataa tha
 Several names were used for complex dengue: for example "infectus thrombocytopenic purpura", "philippine", "thai" and "singapore hemorrhagic fever"
 dongu kaa pratham mahamari roopen hamalaa ek saath asia, africa, uttari america me ek saath 1780 ke lagbhag hua tha, is rog ko 1779 me pahachaanaa tathaa naam diya gaya tha
 In the 1950s, it started spreading in this continuous epidemic in Southeast Asia and by 1975, dengue hemorrhage fever has become the leading cause of child death in these countries
 1990 ke dashak tak dengue malaria ke pashchaat machharon dwaara failane vaala doosraa sabase bada rog ban gaya jisase saal bhar me 4 karod log sankramit hote he vahiin dengue hamerej fever ke bhi hajaaron maamle saamne aate he
 In February 2002, when dengue spread in Rio de Janeiro, 1 million people were hit by it, due to which 16 people died
 march 2008 tak bhi is shahar me dasha bahut acchhee nahin thi keval 3 maheene main 23,555 maamle or 30 maute hui thi
 There is a big outbreak of dengue in about five to six years, because the annual cycle that comes with this disease gives resistance to the patients for some time, as in cases of chikungunya
 jab yah pratirodh kshamta samaapt ho jaati he to log rog ke prati phir se samvedansheel ho jate he, phir dengue ke chaar prakaar ke virus hote he, iske alaava naye log jansankhya me janm yaa pravaas ke jariye jud jate he
 There is ample evidence that SB Halstead has proved by a study that dengue haemorrhagic fever is more common in patients who suffer from secondary infections than those with primary infection
 yadhpi is dharna ko thik se samajha nahin ja sakaa he keval kuch model he jo iske bare me mat vyakt karte he, is dasha ko paramsankraman kii dasha kehete he
 Every year 4000-5000 cases of this disease occur in Singapore, however the common belief is that many cases remain hidden
 dengue ke lakshan dengue virus se sankramit lagbhag 80% logon main koi lakshan nahin hote hai yaa behad halke lakshan hote hai
 About 5% of the infected people become seriously ill
 in logon kii ek choti sankhya main, beemaari jivan ke liye khatarnaak hoti he
 Symptoms occur in a person 3 to 14 days after suffering from dengue virus
 lakshan aksar 4 se 7 dinon ke baad hi dikhte hai
 In this way, if a person returns from an area where dengue is common and he or she has fever or other symptoms 14 days after his or her return, then he / she may not have dengue
 aksar jab bacchon ko dengue bukaar hota he to unke lakshan aam sardi-zukaam yaa antrashoth ) hote hai
 However, children are more likely to develop serious problems with dengue fever
 dengue bukaar ke aise adarsh lakshan kam hote hai jo achaanak shuru ho jate hai jaise sirdard ; chakatte tathaa mansapeshiyon or jodon main dard
 The disease's nickname "bone fracture" refers to how severe this pain can be
 dengue bukaar teen charnon In the fever phase, a person usually has high fever
 bukaar aksar 40 degree celsius hota he
 The person may have general pain and headache
 yah charan aamtaur par 2 se 7 din tak chalata he
 About 50 to 80% of the people who have symptoms in this stage have rashes
 pehle yaa duusare din, chakatte laal twachaa jaise dikh sakate hai
 In the later days of the disease, rashes may look like smallpox
 chote laal daag twachaa par ubhar sakate hai
 These stains do not remove on pressing the skin
 ye laal daag tuuti keshikaon ke kaaran banate hai
 The person may have mild bleeding from the mouth and nose through the mucous membrane
 bukaar apane aap kam hone lagata he tathaa ek yaa do dinon ke liye waapas hone lagata he
 However, this pattern varies among different people
 kuch logon main, ucch bukaar ke jane ke baad beemaari gambhir charan main pravesh kar jaati he
 The severe phase lasts from one to two days
 is charan ke dauraan, chaati tathaa pet main taral kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he, aisa isaliye kyonki rakt nalikaaon main risaav hota he
 Fluid is formed and it circulates throughout the body
 iskaa arth he ki mahatvapurn angon ko unki aavashyaktaa ke anusaar aam taur par rakt nahin miltaa he
 For this reason, organs are unable to function normally
 vyakti ko atyadhik raktasrav bhi ho saktaa he 
 Less than 5% of people with dengue experience circulatory shock, dengue stroke syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever
 yadi kisi vyakti ko pehle kisi duusare prakaar kaa dengue hua ho to usko aisi gambhir samasyaayein hone kii sambhaavnaaen adhik hoti hai
 In the rectification phase, the fluid that leaks out of the blood vessels is incorporated back into the bloodstream
 sudhaar charan 2 se 3 dinon tak chalata he
 The person often becomes much better during this phase
 halanki, unako gambhir khujalaahat tathaa dhimi hriday gati kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 During this phase, the person may go into a liquid overload state
 yadi yah dimag ko prabhavit karata he to, yah chetana ke str main parivartan yaa daure jaisi sthiti laa saktaa he 
 Sometimes dengue can affect other mechanisms of our body
 kisi vyakti main keval lakshan ho sakate hai yaa adarsh dengue lakshan bhi saath main ho sakate hai
 The level of consciousness may decrease in 0
5–6% of cases
 aisa tab ho saktaa he jab dengue virus mastishk main sankraman paidaa karata he
 This can happen even when vital organs are not functioning properly
 anya snayutantr sambandhi vikaar un logon main darj kiye gayi hai jinako dengue bukaar hota he
 For example, dengue can cause transverse myelitis and guillian-barre syndrome
 halanki aisa lagbhag nahin hota he, lekin dengue dil kaa sankraman tathaa gambhir jigar kii vifaltaa paidaa kar saktaa he
 Dengue fever is caused by dengue virus
 vah vaigyanik pranali jisamen virus kaa vargeekaran tathaa namakaran kiya jaataa he uske antargat dengue virus "flaviviriday" parivaar tathaa "flaviviras" jin kaa hissaa he
 Other viruses also belong to this family and can cause diseases in humans
 udhaaharan ke liye, pit-fever virus, west nile virus, saint louis anseflitis virus, japani anseflitis virus, tik- janit anseflitis virus, kyasanur jangal rog virus tathaa omsk rakthasravi bukaar, sabhi "flaviviriday" parivaar se sambandhit hai
 
 Most of these viruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks
 dengue virus, adhiktar adies machharon dwaara sancharit hota he, vishesh rup se adies aegypti prakaar ke machhar se
 These mosquitoes usually occur at altitudes less than 1000 m, at 350 north and 350 south latitudes
 yah adhiktar din ke samay katate hai
 a single bite can also infect humans
 kabhi-kabhaar machharon ko bhi maanvon se dengue mil saktaa he
 If a female mosquito bites an infected person, the mosquito can get the dengue virus
 sabase pehle virus un koshikaon main rahata he jo machhar ke pet main hoti hai
 After about 8 to 10 days, the virus gets infected by the salivary glands of the mosquito that make up the saliva
 iskaa arth he machhar dwaara banaayi gayi laar dengue ke virus se sankramit hoti he
 Therefore, when mosquitoes bite a human, their infected saliva can infect a human
 virus un sankramit machharon ke liye koi samasya paidaa nahin karte dikhte hai, jo apane puure jivan bhar sankramit rahenge
 It is most likely that the Aedes aegypti mosquito spreads dengue
 aisa isaliye ki kyonki ye maanvon ke sabase adhik nazadik rahete hai or jaanwaron kii bajaay maanvon par jite hai
 It prefers to lay eggs in vessels containing man-made water
 dengue sankramit rakt utpaadon tathaa ang daan dwaara fail saktaa he
 If a person infected with dengue donates blood or organ, which is given to another person, this person may get dengue from the blood or organ donated
 kuch deshon jaise singapore main dengue aam he
 In these countries, 1
6 to 6 out of 10,000 blood transfusions spread dengue
 garbhavastha ke dauraan yaa bachche ko janm dete samay dengue virus maan se bachche main bhi fail saktaa he
 Dengue usually does not spread in any other way
 dengue se peedit vayaskon se adhik shishuon tathaa bacchon main beemaari kii gambhirtha hone kii adhik sambhaavna hoti he
 Children are more likely to become seriously ill if they are well nourished
 mahilaon kii apeksha purushon main gambhir beemaari kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma
 jab machhar kisi vyakti ko katata he to isaki laar maanav kii twachaa main pravesh kar jaati he
 If the mosquito has dengue, the virus is in its saliva
 isaliye jab machhar kisi vyakti ko katata he to virus machhar kii laar ke saath vyakti kii twachaa main pravisht ho jaataa he
 The virus attaches to the white blood cells of the person and enters them
 jab shwet rakt kanikaayen sharir main idhar-udhar jaati hai to virus purnutpaadan karata he
 White blood cells react through a variety of signaling proteins such as interleukins, interferons, and tumor necrosis factors
 in protein ke kaaran dengue ke saath bukhaar, flu jaise lakshan tathaa gambhir dard paidaa hote hai
 If a person has severe infections then the virus grows more rapidly in his body
 kyonki virus kii sankhya bahut adhik he isaliye ye kai or angon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Blood escapes from the walls of small blood capillaries into the body's coters
 is kaaran se rakt keshikaon main kam rakt kaa pravaah hota he
 a person's blood pressure falls so low that the heart is not able to supply enough blood to vital organs
 saath hi, asthi majja paryaapt platelets kaa nirmaan nahin kar paati he, jo rakt kaa thakka banane ke liye jaruri he
 Without adequate platelets, the person is quite likely to have bleeding problems
 raktasrav, dengue ke kaaran paidaa hone vaali mukhya jatilta he
 Health care professionals usually diagnose dengue by examining the infected person and seeing that his symptoms resemble dengue
 swasthya seva peshewar, is prakaar se dengue kaa nidaan karne main un kshetron main vishesh rup se sakasham ho sakate hai jahaan par yah aam taur par hota he
 However, when dengue is in its early stages, it is difficult to distinguish it from other viral infections
 kisi vyakti ko sambhawatah dengue tab ho saktaa he jab usko bukhaar ho tathaa nimna main se do lakshan holematlee or ulti; laal chakatte; saamaanya dard ; shwet rakt kanikaon ko kii kam sankhya; yaa sakaaratmak turnicket pareekshan
 Any warning sign and fever in areas where this disease is common is a sign that a person has dengue
 chetavanee chihn aam taur par dengue ke gambhir hone ke pehle dikhne lagate hai
 Tourniquet testing is sufficient when no laboratory tests can be performed
 turnicket pareekshan main swasthya seva peshewar raktchaap naapane vaale upkaran kaa patta vyakti kii bahon ke chaaron ore 5 minute tak baandhta he
 If the person sees red spots on the person's skin, then the healthcare professional counts them
 dhabbon kii sankhya jitani adhik hogi vyakti ko dengue bukhaar hone kii sambhaavna utani adhik hogi
 Differentiating between chikungunya and dengue fever can be difficult
 chikangunia ek aisa viral sankraman he jisamen dengue jaise samaan lakshan hote hai tathaa yah bhi vishwa ke unhi hisson main hota he
 Symptoms of dengue may be other diseases such as malaria, leptopirosis, typhoid fever and meningococcal disease
 aksar, kisi vyakti main dengue kaa nidaan hone ke pehle, uske swasthya seva peshewar is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki vah vyakti inamen se kisi ek paristhiti se peedit na ho, kuch pareekshan karenge
 When a person has dengue, the first change can be seen in a laboratory test of a small number of white blood cells
 kam platelets sankhya tathaa chayapachay amlaraktata bhi dengue ke lakshan hai
 If the person has severe dengue then there will be other changes that can be seen by studying blood
 gambhir dengue ke kaaran rakt dhaaraon se taral kaa risaav ho saktaa he
 This can cause hemoconcentration
 yah rakt main albumin ke str ko bhi kam karata he
 Occasionally severe dengue also produces more pleural effusion or ascites
 yadi isaki maatra paryaapt ho to swasthya seva peshewar ise rogi ke pareekshan ke samay dekh saktaa he
 a healthcare professional may already notice dengue shock syndrome if he or she can use medical ultrasound to look for fluid within the body
 lekin bahut saare aise kshetron main jahaan par dengue aam he, adhiktar swasthya seva peshewaron tathaa chikitsaalayon main ultrasound mashine nahin hoti hai
 In 2009, the World Health Organization classified or divided dengue fever into two types: simple and severe
 iske pehle 1997 main WHO ne rog ko avibhedit tathaa dengue bukhaar main baanta tha
 The WHO decided that this old method of dividing dengue fever needed to be simplified
 isane yah bhi tay kiya ki purana tarika kaaphi simit tha: isamen ve sabhi tareeke shaamil nahin the jinase dengue apane ko prastut kar saktaa tha
 Although the method of dengue classification was officially changed, the old classification is still used
 WHO kii puraani paddati main dengue rakthasravi bukhaar ko chaar charnon main vibhakt kiya gaya tha, jinako grad I–IV kaha jaataa tha: Dengue fever can be diagnosed by laboratory testing of microbiology
 kuch bhinn pareekshan bhi kiye ja sakate hai
 a test in the culture of the cells isolates the dengue virus
 ek anya pareekshan virus se neucleic amlon kii pahchaan karata he, jisamen polimress chen riection kahi jane vaali takanic kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 a third test identifies the virus's antigen
 ek anya pareekshan rakt main unpratirakshiyon kii pahchaan karata he jo dengue virus se sharir ko ladane kii kshamta dete hai
 Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection tests are better than antigen detection
 halanki in pareekshanon kii laagat adhik hoti he, isaliye ye adhik sthanon par uplabdh nahin hai
 All these tests can be negative when dengue disease is in its early stages
 pratirakshi pareekshan ke alaava ye prayogshaala pareekshan keval beemaari ke gambhir charan ke dauraan dengue bukhaar ke nidaan main sahaayak ho sakate hai
 However, immunological tests can confirm that a person is in a later stage of dengue infection
 sharir pratirakshiyon kaa nirmaan karata he jo vishisht rup se 5 se 7 dinon baad dengue virus se ladate hai
 No vaccine has yet been approved to protect people from dengue virus
 sankraman ko rokane ke liye vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne machharon kii jansankhya ko niyantrit karne tathaa logon ko machharon ke kaate jane se bachaane kaa suzav diya he
 The WHO has suggested a program for prevention of dengue which consists of 5 different parts: machharon ko niyantrit karne tathaa logon ko isse kaate jane se bachaane ke liye WHO kuch vishisht suzav bhi detaa he
 The best way to control the "aedes aegypti" mosquito is to get rid of its habitats
 logon ko pani ke khule paatro ko khaali rakhana chaiye 
 Pesticides or biological control agents can also be used to control mosquitoes in these areas
 vaigyanikon kaa yah maananaa he ki organophosphate yaa pirethyroid insecteside kaa chhidkaav koi sahaayta nahin karata he
 Stagnant water should be eliminated because it attracts mosquitoes and also because bacteria can be born in this stagnant water causing health problems
 machharon ke kaatane se bachane ke liye log aise kapade pahan sakate hai jo puri tarah se unki twachaa ko junk kar rakhen
 They can use insecticides, which will keep mosquitoes away
 log, aaraam karte samay masahari kaa bhi upyog kar sakate hai
 There is no vaccine present in the market at this time, although the experiments in Thailand have been largely successful
 dengue se bachaav kaa sabase prabhavi tarika machharon kii aabaadi pe kaabo karnaa he is ke liye yaa to larva pe niyantran karnaa hota he yaa vayask machharon kii aabaadi par
 Aedes mosquitoes breed in artificial water storage containers such as tires, bottles, coolers, bouquets
 These vessels should be emptied frequently
 This is considered the best method of larval control
 vayask machharon ko kaabo me karne hetu kitnashak dhuna kisi seemaa tak prabhavi ho sakate he, machharon ko kaatane se roak dena bhi ek tarika he kintu is prajati ke machhar din me katate he jisase maamla gambhir ban jaataa he
 a new method is to put an aquatic insect called Mesosaclopus that is a larval eater into stagnant water such as gambusia fish as an effective remedy against malaria
 yah behad prabhavi, sasta tathaa paryaavaran mitra vidhi he iske viruddh machhar kabhi pratirohak kshamta hasil nahin kar sakate he kintu is hetu saamudayik bhagidaari sakriy rup se chahie
 Mosquito nets, repellent, covering the body, and staying away from the affected areas
 pit fever kii vaikaseen ek sambandhit flavivyras ke viruddh he use dengue ke viruddh parivartit rup main prayog karne kii salaah di jaati he kintu is sambandh me koi vistrut adhyayan nahin kiya gaya he
 In 2006, a scientific group from Argentina discovered the breeding method of the virus, which is expected to find an effective drug against it
 dengue bukhaar ke liye koi vishisht upachaar nahin he
 Depending on the symptoms, there are different treatments for different people
 kuch log gharon par maatr taral pikar behatar ho sakate hai, jiske saath unke swasthya seva peshewar najdiki rup se unke swasthya kii nigaraanee karke yah sunishchit kar sakate hai ki ve behatar ho rahe hon
 Some others may require intravenous or blood transfusion
 yadi kisi vyakti kii pehle se jatil swasthya sthiti kii samasya he to, swasthya seva peshewar us vyakti ko aspataal main bhartee karne kaa nirnay le sakate hai
 When a person needs intravenous fluid, usually they may need it for a day or two
 swasthya seva peshewar taral kii maatra ko badhayega jisase ki vyakti mutr kii ek tay maatra nirgat kar sake
 The amount of fluid can also be increased so that a person's hematocrit and vital signs can return to normal
 raktasrav ke jokhim ke kaaran swasthya seva peshewar, nasogastric intubeshan, antahpeshiy injection tathaa dhamniyon main panchar karnaa jaisi aakraamak chikitsa prakriyaaon se bachate hai
 Acetaminophen can be given for fever and pain
 sujan-rodhi dawa kaa ek prakaar jise NSAID kehete hai, prayog nahin kii jaani chaiye kyonki raktasrav hone kii kaaphi sambhaavna hoti he
 If the vital signs of the person do not change or become normal and if the number of red blood cells in their blood is decreasing, then blood transfusion should be started early
 jab rakt aadhaan kii aavashyaktaa ho to vyakti ko sampurna rakt yaa pack kii gayi laal rakt kanikaon ko diya janaa chaiye
 Platelets and freshly frozen plasma are generally not recommended
 jab vyakti dengue ke sudhaar vaale charan main hota he to aam taur par use or antah shira dravya nahin diye jate hai jisase ki uske sharir main taral kii maatra adhik na ho
 If there is an excess of liquor but the vital signs of that person are fixed, then it is enough to stop giving more money
 yadi vyakti rog kii jatil avasthaa main na ho to, use furosemide jaise loop mutrvardhak diye ja sakate hai
 This will help in removing excess fluid from the blood circulation of that person
 dengue se peedit adhiktar log thik ho jate hai or unako baad main kisi tarah kii koi samasya nahin hoti he
 1 to 5% of people infected with dengue die due to lack of treatment
 achche upachaar ke baavjood 1% se kam logon kii mrityu ho jaati he
 However, 26% of people suffering from severe dengue die
 dengue 110 se adhik deshon main aam he
 Each year, 50 to 100 million people around the world are affected by it
 prayek varsh, puri duniya ke iske chalate aadhe million log aspataal main bhartee hote hai tathaa lagbhag 12,500 se 25,000 logon kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Dengue is the most common viral disease spread by arthropods
 yah mana jaataa he ki dengue ke upar prati million jansankhya main se lagbhag 1600 viklaangata samyojit jivan varsh kaa bhaar he
 This means that dengue ends 1600 years of life per million population
 yah utana hi he jitna ki rog bhaar anya bachapan yaa tibi jaisi ushnkaribandheey bimariyon kaa he
 Dengue is the second most important tropical disease after malaria
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan bhi dengue ko 16 upekshit ushnkaribandheey bimariyon main se ek maanata he
 Dengue is becoming more common all over the world
 1960 ke mukaable 2010 main dengue 30 guna adhik aam tha
 Many things are responsible for the spread of dengue
 shaharon main adhik log rahane lage hai
 The world's population is increasing
 adhik se adhik log ab antarrashtriya yatraaen kar rahe hai
 Global warming is also considered to be a reason for the spread of dengue
 dengue sabase adhik bumadhya rekha ke aasapaas hota he
 The area where dengue occurs is inhabited by 2
5 billion people
 inamen se 70 pratishat log asia or prashanth kshetra se hai
 2
9% to 8% of those who travel back from these dengue affected areas in the USA are those who have fever and who get affected during the journey
 logon ke is samooh main malaria ke baad dengue doosraa sabase aam sankraman he jiskaa nidaan hota he
 Scientists are researching the routes of prevention and treatment of dengue
 log machharon par niyantran paane vaxin banane tathaa virus se ladane ke liye dawaaen banane par kaary kar rahe hai
 Many simple works have been done to control mosquitoes
 udhaaharan ke liye gappiyaan yaa koppod ko tehre huye pani main machharon ke larva khaane ke liye daalaa ja saktaa he
 Scientists are working on making vaccines to protect people from all four types of dengue
 kuch vaigyanik is baat se chintit he ki vaxin, antibody-nirbhar vruddhi ke kaaran gambhir rog ke jokhim ko badha saktaa he
 The best possible vaccine will have somewhat different quality
 pehla, yah surakshit hoga
 Second, it will be functional after one or two injections
 teesraa, yah sabhi prakaar dengue virus se suraksha pradaan karegaa
 Fourth, it will not produce ADE
 paanchvaan, iskaa parivahan tathaa sangrahan aasaan hoga
 Sixth, it will be low-cost and cost-effective
 2009 tak kuch vaxinon kaa pareekshan kiya gaya tha
 Scientists hope that the first vaccine will be ready for commercial manufacture by 2015
 fi Scientists are working to make anti-virus drugs to treat the attack of dengue fever and to protect people from serious complications
 ve is baat par bhi kaam kar rahe he ki virus kii protein sanrachana kis prakaar kii he
 This may help in the creation of effective medicines for dengue

 apane janm ke sambandh main nishtar khaanqaahi ne bataaya- 'koi ricard nahin he, lekin maukhik rup main jo kuch mujhe bataaya gaya he, uske anusaar 1930 ke nikalate jaadon main kisi din meraa janm hua tha, jahanabad naam ke gaanv main, jahaan mere walid saiyad mauhammad hossain kii choti-si jameendaari thi
 ' nishtar khaanqaahi ke pita jahanabad ke jane-maane jameendaar the
 People used to call his father Mr
 Pir Ji
 ve apane kshetra ke sammanit vyakti the
 His mother was the daughter of a zamindar family of village Mudhal, located near Chandpur
 nishtar sahab ne bachapan main ek ausat jameendaar parivaar kii khushhaali dekhi or usamen ve paley-bade hue hai
 Your father was a very tough person
 is kaaran aapkaa lagaav maan se adhik tha
 Your mother was a female woman
 unhone bachapan main hi aapako farsi ke mahaan shaayaron- hafij shiraji, saadi or nazira kaa kavy kanthsth kara diya tha
 She herself used to do poetry
 'janaab nishtar khaanqaahi kii maan farsi kii vidhushi thim
 He studied Unani medicine through Persian and also poetry in Persian
 unka ek ghazal-sangrah bhi tha, jo nishtar sahab ke durlabh pustkaalay ke saath hi nasht ho gaya
 'thus his mother had full influence on Nishtar Saheb
 sambhavat: bachapan main apni maan se mili ye sanskaar hi the ki ve ek safal shaayar ban sake
 Education of Nishtar Khanqahi started from home
 apni umr ke aathven varsh main ve gaanv ke nikatavarti shahar bijanour main aa gaye or yahan par ek angreji vidhyalay main pravesh lekar padhane lage
 From this age, he also studied Urdu and Persian
 in bhashaaon ke sahitya kii ore unka vishesh lagaav tha
 That is why he studied many books of excellent poetry
 apni adhyayansheel pravriti ke sambandh main nishtar ji kehete hai- 'yadi aap jhooth na maane to bataaun ki us avasthaa main lakhon kii sankhya main urdu asaaar mujhe yaad the
 The school teacher started calling me Ghalib without becoming a poet
 ' nishtar ji bachapan se hi adhyayansheel rahe
 His mind was more pleasant to read than sports
 unke abhibhavak jab unhen khel kii ore pravrutt karte to ise ve bade baari man se hi sweekaarte
 Nishtar ji says that whenever the householders were forced to play, my compulsion was that i had to go
 ' sahitya or sahitya se sambandhit jitani pustaken milti raheen, ve unhen din-raat padhate rahe
 At one time he also came that his mother and close relatives started to fear that he would not lose his health while studying
 isliye unhen shaam ko do ghante khilne ke liye vivash kiya gaya
 But for the first time when i was sent to play kabaddi in a team of boys of the locality, in the very first grip, he snapped his shoulder
 sab log is baat se pareshaan hue lekin ve santusht the ki ab kuch samay lete-lete padhane kaa avasar milegaa
 'nishtar ji passed the high school examination by staying in Bijnor
 man main kuch kar guzarane kii umang thi
 Subject to this sentiment, he went to Delhi after crossing seventeen spring of his age
 kuch samay tak vahaan rahe, kintu dilli main manachaaha or upyukt kaam na milane ke kaaran waapas bijanour aakar apni aage kii padhai main lag gaye or inter kii shiksha puri kii
 'although Nishtar ji has received school education up to the inter, but the life of a litterateur is always spent in study and writing
 vah nit nayaa padhata he, nit nayaa sikhta he or apane anubhavon ke anusaar nit nai rachana karata he
 His education is like a river running at an uninterrupted pace
 sahitya ke kshetra main pravesh : gazalkaar khaanqaahi ji ne sahitya-kshetra main apni baalyavastha se hi qadam rakh die the
 His talent for writing was God-given
 unki matashri swayan ek acchhee gazalakaara thim
 His influence was bound to fall on Nishtar ji
 ve apni umr ke pratham dashak se hi ghazal-lekhan main jute gaye the
 In this regard, Nishtar himself writes- 'somebody started writing poetry from the age of eight or nine and by the time he reached the age of twelve-thirteen years, Kalam had attained a lot of solidarity
 aamtaur par raat ke samay jab sab log so jate, main dhyanamgn ho jaataa
 In the east, there was a bright rise of the morning, but i did not realize it
 raatbhar main sau-sau sher kah daalata or visheshta yah thi ki sirf ginati ke sahare par ye saare sher subah ko kaagaz par utaar letaa
 My memory was amazing in those days
 ' prakhyat gazalkaar, evam sameekshak dow girirajsharan agarwal ke poochne par ve kehete hai- 'shaayari padhane kaa chaska to kaafii pehle lag gaya tha, kintu abhi tak shaayari kii na thi
 One day a kite was flying on the roof of his house
 meraa ek sambandhi yuvak bhi saath main tha
 Kite flying - started saying that let's write ghazals today
 ham logon ne patang udaana choda or ghazal likhni shuru kii
 In ten minutes i said seven lions
 unamem se antim sher aaj bhi yaad he
 You should also listen to the poetry of the children
 You are also happy in the Karam; in the sitam too, the 'nishtar' slave is yours
 apni inter pariksha uteern karne ke pashchaat nishtar ji kaa parichay urdu ke prakhyat patrkaar shri hamidul ansaari gaji ke saath hua
 As a result, he went to Bombay in 1950 at the age of twenty and started working in the 'jamhooriyat' daily newspaper
 kuch hi samay vyateet hua tha ki gaanv main unke pitashri ek durghatana ke shikaar ho gaye
 For this reason Nishtar ji had to come back to Bijnor from Bombay
 ve bijanour laut to aae kintu unka man yahan laga nahin
 He wanted to use the journalism he had learned while living in 'jamhooriyat' in Bombay
 saath-hi-saath patrakarita-sambandhi apane alpagyaan ko or aage badhaakar thos dharaatal pradaan karnaa chaahate the
 So he moved to Delhi in 1952
 dilli jaakar nishtar ji kaa judaav vibhinn patr-patrikaon se hua, jinka sampadan unhone apni mehnat se kushaltapurvak kiya
 With regard to his Delhi movement and migration, he writes - 'I moved to Delhi around 1952, where i got an opportunity to edit the famous magazine' Shahrah 'of the Progressive Writers' Association
 yah dilli kii vah aitihaasik patrika thi, jise mujhase pehle sahir ludhiaanvi, fikr tausavin, makhmoor jalandhri, zoe ansaari tathaa vamiq jonpuri jaisi hastiyaan sampadit kar chuki thim
 Later i got involved with the famous Urdu monthly 'twentieth Century'
 ' nishtar ji ko 'beesvin sadi' main kaary karte kuch hi samay beetaa tha ki uske maalik janaab kashtar giraami se kisi baat par anban ho gai
 Therefore, except for working in the 'twentieth century', took up the editing work of the magazine 'mushahida' started by friends
 'mushahida' patrika kaa prakaashan saal-dedh saal kii laghu avadhi tak hi ho paaya
 In this way Nishtar ji spent sixteen years of his life in Delhi, after spending days on Fakamasti, sometimes associated with various literary institutions and magazines
 jeevandaayini ganga ke tat par mukt vaataavaran main rahane vaale, dur tak ganga-kachaar ko ekatak dekhne vaale nishtar ji ko dilli kii rangadaar jindagi, jo andar se kuch or he, to baahar se kuch or, raas nahin ai
 His health began to deteriorate and he returned to Bijnor again after suffering from arthritis, after having an active participation in various literary activities in Delhi for sixteen years, smelling the entire atmosphere
 tab se ve bijanour main anek saahitiyik sansthaaon se jude hai
 For a long time he was associated with the daily newspapers 'bijnor Times', Bijnor Times Urdu and 'chingari' published from the Bijnor headquarters
 vartmaan main nishtar sahab swatantra rup se sahitya-sadhana main rat hai
 And now this is their goal, this is their mission also that till the last breath of life, they should remain in literature
 manovaigyanik dharaatal par yah tathy sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki prayek praani ko shaareerik evam maansik gun adhikanshat: vanshanukram se praapt hote hai
 Also, the truth cannot be ignored that the environment, country and geographical conditions also have an impact on him
 gazalkaar nishtar khaanqaahi ke vyaktitv par unke parivesh kaa prabhaav to padaa hi, saath hi kavy-pratibha unhen apane parivaar se viraasat main mili he, vishesh rup main matashri se
 'khan Khanji himself seems to agree with this -' What i have received from my mother's legacy is not only the passion for poetry and literature, but also the quality of tolerating the adverse conditions and sad conditions
 
 mujhamen aam logon se kahin zyaada sahanshakti he
 The bind of my memory does not break easily
 ' nishtar khaanqaahi apane namakaran ke sambandh main ek dilachasp kahani bataate hai
 In fact his name was Anwar Hussain in the beginning
 anawaar hossain ne apni umr ke pratham dashak se hi shaayari karnaa aarambh kar diya tha
 At the age of nine, when he tried to write ghazal with a friend, his friend suggested the name 'nishtar' to bear the surname at that time
 ' yadhyapi shaayari karne kii pratibha nishtar ji ko apni matashri se mili
 Journalism, satire, fiction, storytelling, poetry and other types of writing talent did not get him in succession, but it is a result of his long literary struggle, contact with various writers, creators and self-acquired knowledge
 sahitya-sarjan kii vividhonmukhi pratibha ke dhani janaab nishtar khaanqaahi urdu ke saath hindisahitya-jagat ke gaurav stambh hai
 His multi-faceted personality-work has enriched Hindi-literature and Urdu-literature
 nishtar ji ne hindisahitya ko gadhy-padya donon vidhaon se alankrita kiya he
 Your personality is simultaneously comprised of a variety of dimensional features of a competent critic, critic, ghazalakar, critic, storyteller, satirist, journalist and a true guide
 aapane apni bahu-aiami pratibha kaa parichay sahitya me ghazal, ekanki, aalochana, lekh, kahani, vyangy-niabandh aadi sahitya vidhaon ke madhyam se prastut kiya he
 Dr
 Meena Aggarwal writes in relation to his writing- 'the field of creation of Nishtar sahib is not one, rather say that there is no genre of literature in which he has not written, whether poetry or story
 yahan tak ki unke sampadakiyon main bhi aaj kii paristhitiyon kaa sateek chithran miltaa he
 'eminent litterateur Dr
 Giriraj Sharan Agrawal has been very close to Nishtar ji for more than two decades
 ve nishtar ji ko apana kavy guru bhi maanate hai
 Dr
 Aggarwal has observed each and every odd situation of Khanqahi very closely
 saath-saath unki saahitiyik pratibha ko gaharaai se mahasoos kiya he
 That is why they say- 'if i say that Nishtar Khanahi, who gained fame as a poet or ghazalkar, is not only a poet or ghazalkar, he is a successful storyteller, playwright but with equal rights in almost every genre of prose Many of you readers will be surprised if you are a writer who writes
 shri khaanqaahi ne nazmen, gazalen, yaa kavitaayen hi nahin likhin balki kahaniyaan, naatak, niabandh raajnneetik sandarbhon ke lekh, rekhachitr, vyangy arthath gadhy kii lagbhag sabhi vidhaon main lekhankaarya kiya or puure str ke saath kiya
 It is another matter that he became famous as a poet with the publication of his poetry books, but due to the prose being unpublished or published less, he could not get the place in other areas of literature which he should get
 Was
 ' yon to khaanqaahi ji kavi or shaayar ke rup main prasiddhi-praapt rachanaakaar hai, kintu unhone apana saahitiyik parichay ek kahanikar ke rup main us samay diya, jab 1950-51 main tatkaaleen prasiddh saahitiyik patrika 'beesvin sadi' main unki kahani 'mariyam' prakashit hui
 The story was so strong that he had inadvertently forgotten to write his name on the story and the letter sent to the editor, but the story was published only with the village name
 'kahani par apana naam likhnaa bhul jane kii baat, darasal, shri khaanqaahi kii apni rachanaaon ke prati laaparvaahee or vairaygy kii bhaavana kaa dyotak he
 The truth is that he has always been very careless towards his creations
 is puure saahitiyik jivan main unhone jitna kuch likhaa he, gadhy ke rup main athwa padya ke rup main, vah kahan gaya- koi nahin jaanata
 In one meeting, he told that in his youth he had written some long poetry in Urdu, including 'satan spared' and 'farishte Khuda ke darbar' published and became famous but now he has no idea
 nishtar sahab ke liye kisi bhi vidha main likhnaa saamaanya-si baat he, kintu unke vyaktitv kaa ek prabhaavshaalee paksh he ki unki drushti sadaiv aadmi or uske bheetar ke aadmi, samaaj or uske bheetar ke samaaj par tiki rahati he, jo yatharth ko kala ke sundar rup main prastut karti he
 The exact proof of this is his story 'half a hand full life'
 kahani kii nayika myria simon viklang hone ke uparaant bhi swayan ko samaaj kii dayaa kaa paatr nahin bananaa chaahati he, swayan sangharsh karti he or kahati he- 'log mujh par dayaa karte hai, mere saahas kii prashansa nahin karte
 Does religion mean that by considering others as inferior, by considering them as weak, without helplessness, strong people keep satisfying their ego
 prabhu mujhe kshamaa karnaa
 i do not know who is good at understanding the meaning of words and who is not right
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki dayaa shashakt logon dwaara durbal logon par hi kii jaati he
 But debility xxrep 8 
 ? Should it remain only because strong people continue to do injustice to him in the name of mercy
 ' janaab nishtar khaanqaahi bahuaiami pratibha sampann rachanaakaar hai
 He is a person supplied with a sense of belonging and a true guide to the creators
 nishtar ji atyant samvedansheel vyakti hai
 They say- 'auntie had proved that i was so sensitive from the mother's stomach, which is not as common as normal children
 baad main is samvedansheeltaa ne mere vyaktitv ko kitna joda-todaa, yah kahani bahut lambii he
 The sensitivity of Nishtar ji is so deep that for this reason he has endured many sufferings in life
 unhone jin baton kaa virodh karnaa chahie tha unka bhi virodh nahin kiya, apitu chupchaap mahasoos karte rahe or andar hi andar ghulte rahe hai, swayan par kathor anushaasan karte rahe
 He writes- 'the biggest curse for me in my life has been to be sensitive to me
 isi samvedansheeltaa ke garbh se meri charitrik durbalata evam bhaygrastata kii naagfani ne janm liya
 If not sensitive, only emotional, he could scream, make noise, rebel in response to the situation or the behavior of his strangers
 kintu main aisa nahin kar sakaa, kyonki samvedansheel aadmi kii pravriti hi chupchaap mahasoos karnaa or der tak ghulte rahanaa hoti he
 He does not flare slowly, and eventually burns itself to ashes in his own fire
 ' nishtar ji jhooth or asaty-bhaashan, farebabaazi se ghrinaa karte hai
 He has stayed away from these bad qualities since his childhood
 kisi laalach athwa swaarth-purti ke liye unhone galat kaa, samaaj-virodhiyon kaa paksh nahin liya
 He is a gentle and fair writer
 nishtar ji kaa gun he, kisi bhi prakaar kii chaturaai, tikadambaazi se dur rahanaa
 They have always been separate from the sycophants - we had suspended ourselves in the chaperones
 vartmaan sahityakaron main ek varisht evam pramukh naam he- nishtar khaanqaahi ji kaa
 Slender body, lean waist, but seeing the owner of such a personality, the meaning of the name can be understood
 nishtar ji kaa kad na adhik lanbaa he na chota, darmiyaan kad-lathi ke maalik, chaudee muhar vaala safed pajama, upar kurtta evam kurtte ke baahar basket, bal sidhe peeche ko kaade hue, saaf-sapaat unchaa maathaa, rickshaw mil gai to thik, nahin mili to ho liye sadq kii ek thor par paidal hi paidal jahaan tak rickshaw nahin milti arthath kisi prakaar kii pratiksha nahin kerani he
 In fact, this principle has been adopted by Nishtar ji in his life, whether something is achieved or not, but in the field of literature, he has been dynamic in various dimensions
 nishtar khaanqaahi ke naam kii saahitiyik rup main vyakhya kar dow minaa agarwal likhti hai- 'nashtar yaa nishtar kaa arth he cheer-faad karne kaa yantra
 In literature, ripping occurs at the level of words as well
 nishtar sahab kii shaayari bhi ek aisa hi nashtar he ki pathak ke dil main swayan bindh jaataa he
 His poetry is touching the heart
 ' nishtar ji kii ek pravriti or gun he, sabhi par sahajata se vishwaas kar lenaa
 If a person comes in contact with them even for the first time, they believe in his words
 is kaaran kai baar unako aahat bhi hona padataa he, unhone dhokhaa bhi khaaya he
 They only say sadly - they have learned from life, we have also had opportunities in the world, love and love, because the natural quality of Nishtar ji is to trust others in a natural way
 ve apane puraane sambandhon main sadaiv apanepan kii khoj karte rahete hai
 He always struggled
 vah chaahe saamaajik kshetra ho athwa saahitiyik kshetra
 They have learned to live life by burning sesame seeds
 vastav main ve jeevat ke dhani vyakti hai-bhasam hoke siikhaa hunar aag kaabanaata hoon kaagaz pe ghar aag kaa nishtar ji ne sadaiv nari-jati ko sammaan kii drushti se dekha he
 They have closely understood the agony of his life
 vah pidaa unki kahaniyon, kavitaaon, naatakon aadi main vyakt hui he
 Describing the famous Urdu poet Izhar Asrar Nishtar ji as the poet of the sixth sense, highlighting his personality, he writes: 'nishtar is a living sensitive person of this era and the problems that can be faced in this era, Nishtar has gone through them
 swayan kaa dukh, rojgaar kaa dukh, apane-paraayon kaa dukh, rishton-naaton kaa dukh
 It means that as much as sorrows may be, Nishtar has tasted them all
 ' vastav main khaanqaahi ji ek aise jeevat sangharkshil vyaktitv ke dhani maanav hai, jo dukhon ke baanon ko sharir or aatma kii gaharaaiyon tak utaarne ke uparaant bhi kisi str par vichlit nahin hote, chinate-chillaate nahin, apitu ek darshanik kii bhanti is yug ke sambandhon kii samiksha karte hue apane path par agrasar ho jate hai
 One of the hallmarks of Nishtar Saheb is that he does not have any discrimination at the religious level
 unki soch sadaiv jati-paati or saamaajik bhedbhaav se upar uthakar vyaavhaarik str kii he
 But they also accept themselves as trustworthy
 unka swayan kaa kathan he- 'sahitya ne or vaigyanik soch ne mujhe or mere-jaise kai auron ko bhi deen-dharm, jati-panti or saamaajik bhedbhaav se upar uthakar sochna evam vyavhaar karnaa sikhaaya
 If you want, you can add a semi-atheistic aspect to my personality, in which somewhere a faithful thief is hidden somewhere, but which is completely different from religious discrimination, which does not see a man in religion, caste or any other place
 maanav uske liye pehle bhi maanav he or ant main bhi maanav, jo use uski samast durbalataaon evam prabalataon-sahit sweekaar karata he
 'nishtar Saheb is also a believer in social level and believes in religion, but on the level of intelligence, he has no faith in religion
 unka maananaa he ki jis prakaar bhautikwaadiyon ne apni satta ke liye shakti ko aadhaar banaaya he, usee prakaar aadhyatmik satta sthapit karne waalon ne apane vivek or maansik shakti se aisi vyavastha sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya, jo pehle se adhik shaktishaalee ho
 In this context, i write in my work 'how people met' - 'I have no faith in any religion at the level of intelligence
 mujhe lagata he, jaise bhautik satta sthapit karne waalon ne apni shakti se kaam lekar janata ko apane adheen bana rakhaa he, vaise aadhyatmik satta kaayam karne waalon ne apane vivek or maansik shakti se kaam lekar ek aisi badi vyavastha kii, jo pehali vyavastha se bhi kahin zyaada shaktishaalee thi or phir ye donon sattayen milakar aadmi ko jad evam das banane main lag gayi
 ' 'main bahut hi komalhruday aadmi hoon
 Quickly melting like wax
 karunaa kaa bhav meri nas-nas main bharaa he
 Do not be surprised if you ever read a sad story, watching a sad scene of the film and saving the most eyes and wiping tears from your handkerchief
 meri ankhen bahut jald chhalak uthati hai
 Memories of the past make me cry in solitude as well
 kai baar maine sochaa he ki agar meri had se badi hui samvedansheeltaa buddhi se niyantrit na hoti ho to main apane swabhaav kii durbalata ke kaaran kisi bhi asahneeya sthiti ko na jhel pate hue aatmahatya bhi kar saktaa tha
 But i got extraordinary stamina along with tender heartedness, as well as the ability to work with prudence xxrep 7 
 so i lived in the worst condition
 ' nishtar ji kii samvedansheeltaa hi he, jo apana hi nahin samaaj ke har dukh kii kasak ye mahasoos karte dikhaai dete hai, isiilie ve likhte hai-dhamak kahin ho, larajti hai khidqiyaan merigata kahin ho, tapakataa he syban meraa
 Highlighting the sensitivity of the poet Izhar Asar Nishtar Khanahi writes: 'nishtar is a highly sensitive poet, therefore contemporary consciousness exists in his works with all its brilliance
 unka astitv samvedansheel photograpi k plate kii tarah he
 Just as a photograph plate draws a reflection of every light falling on it, similarly the life of Nishtar assimilates every sorrow, every joy, every color, every shadow, every darkness, every ray, ie every situation And then it elevates that feeling in the form of a picture
 ' astu, apni umr ke saatven dashak main chal rahe gazalkaar, sahityakar or varisht patrkaar zanaab nishtar khaanqaahi kaa jivan nitant gramin parivesh se aarambh hua jo dilli, bombai tak pahunchaa, kintu pun: waapas apane grih janapad mukhyalay lautaa or yaheen kaa hokar rah gaya
 After returning he got absorbed in his literary practice, which is still a resource
 hamaari kaamana he ki bahuaiami pratibha-sampann sahityakar zanaab nishtar khaanqaahi dderghaayu paaen or hindi-sahitya ko samrudh karte rahen
 Renowned critics, playwrights, ghazals and satirists look at the literary works of Nishtar Khanahee, while it is widely spread, the available works can be counted in the fingers
 jis vyakti ne apane jivan ke pratham dashak se lekhan aarambh kiya ho or jo jivan ke saat dashakon tak abaadh gati se baraabar lekhnee chalaa rahaa ho, uski kritiyaan itani kam maatra main uplabdh hon to aashcharya evam vismay kii baat avashya he
 In such a long literary life, why is so little literature of Nishtar available? This question is a matter of natural curiosity
 iske peeche do kaaran hai
 He did not keep any copy of his works with him
 akashwani se prakashit hone vaali athwa patr-patrikaon main prakashit hone vaali rachanaaon- rupakon, kahaniyon, lekhon, nazmon athwa gazalon kii praaia: koi prati unke paas nahin he
 The second reason is even more annoying
 unheen ke shabdon main- 'ustaadon kii talash se niraash hokar jab maine abhyaas or pustakon ko apana guru mana to har saal rachanaaon kaa ek bada sangrah taiyaar ho jaataa, kintu main har saal swayan use aag laga detaa
 This sequence continued for almost twenty years
 har pandulipi paanch sau se saat sau prishthon tak kii hoti thi
 It can only be imagined from the statement of Ghazalkar Nishtar that if there was systematic publication of the literature composed by him, then the literature-world would be available to read his rich literature today
 jivan kii vibhinn vikat samasyaon se do-chaar hote hue samay kii gati ke saath nishtar ji kaa jeevanchakra bhi aage badhata rahaa
 Now if we try to look into his creation-world, then the following works published in Hindi language are available- 1

 Elements with relatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulfur, are more common on Earth than on Earth; These elements were presumably removed from areas close to the Sun by the solar wind energized by renewed stars
 grahon ke gathan ke baad, sabhi tathakthith ' 'aadi bheeshan bambaari' ' ke adheen rahe the
 About 60% of the surface of Mars represents a record of traumas from that era, while much of the rest of the surface has probably been lowered by the ravine valleys created by those events

 Commonly accepted theories include the fact that they are deeply embedded in soil surfaces that appeared after landslides of bright dust
 kai spashtikaran saamne rakh die gaye, jinamein se kuch pani yaa jeevon kii vruddhi bhi shaamil karte he
 Liquid water is not present on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure, except for short periods at low altitudes
 do dhruviya barfili chotiyaan mote taur par jal se bani hui najar aati hai
 The amount of aquatic ice in the South Polar icy peak, if melted, is sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface up to 11 meters deep
 jaleey barf kii vishaal maatra mangal ke mote cryosphere ke neeche fansi hui hona maani gayi hai
 Radar data transmitted from the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows large amounts of aquatic ice at both poles and mid-latitudes
 31 july 2008 ko phinics lander ne mangal kii uthali mitti main jaleey barf kii sidhi jaanch kii
 The visual effects of Mars strongly suggest that liquid water has existed on the surface of the planet for at least some time
 mangal kii do sthaayee dhruviya barf tapiyaan he
 During the winter of the Pole, it remains in constant darkness, freezes the surface and causes the deposition of 25–30% of the atmosphere from the layers of CO2 ice
 jab dhruv phir se surya prakaash se ujagar hote he, jami hui CO2 kaa urdhvapathan hota he, jabardast hawaaon kaa nirmaan hota he jo dhruvon ko 400 kimi / ghante kii raftaar se jhaad detii he
 These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor, which gives rise to blight and large clouds like the Earth
 2004 main oporcunity dwaara jal-barf ke badalon kaa chhayankan kiya gaya tha
 Polar caps on both poles are mainly made of water-ice

 During the northern summer of Mars, the North Polar cap has a diameter of around 1
000 km, and covers about 1
6 million cubic km of ice, which if spread evenly over the cap, would be 2 km The diameter of the southern polar cap is 350 km and the thickness is 3 km
 dakshin dhruviya topi or sameepvarti starit nikshepon main barf kii kul maatra kaa anumaan 16 lakh ghan kimi kaa lagaaya gaya he
 Both polar caps display spiral troughs, which has been shown by recent ice penetration radar autumn) analyzes to be a result of downward winds and spirals due to the Coriolis effect
 dakshini barf topi ke paas ke kuch ilaakon ke mausami tusharachhadan kaa parinaam, jameen ke upar shushk barf kii 1 meter moti paardarshee parat ke nirmaan ke rup main hota he
 With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressurizes the bottom of the evaporated CO2 layer, rising up and eventually breaking it
 yah prakriya kaali besaalti ret yaa dhul ke saath mishrit CO2 ke gijar-sadrishy vishfot kaa netritv karti he
 This process is accelerated, seen to occur in space for a few days, weeks, or months, but rather a rate of unusual change in geology — especially for Mars
 gijar ke sthaan par parat ke neeche kii gas teji se daudti he jo barf ke andar trigyi vahikaaon kii ek makadi jaisi akruti ko tarashti he
 NASA has discovered that water is found on Mars
 haalanki johaan henrich medler or vilhem bear ko chandramaa ke maanchitran ke liye behatar dhang se yaad kiya jaataa he, jo ki pehle "hawaii photographer" the
 Most of the superficial shapes of Mars were permanent, they began to lay its foundation and more closely determine the planet's rotation period
 1840 main, medler ne das varshon ke sanyukt avlokanon ke baad mangal kaa pehla nakshaa khinchaa
 Rather than naming various topographies, Madler and Beer simply designated them with letters; Thus Meridian Bay was the figure "a"
 aaj, mangal kii akritiyon ke naam vividh sroton par se rakhe gaye he
 Albido figures are named from classical mythology
 60 kimi se bade cretar, divangat vaigyanikon yaa lekhakon yaa anya jinhone mangal ke adhyayan ke liye yogadan diya he, par se namit he
 Craters smaller than 60 km are named in cities and villages of the world with a population of less than one lakh
 badi ghaatiyon ke naam vibhinn bhashaaon main sitaron ke naam par se or isi tarah choti ghaatiyon ke naam nadiyon par se he
 Large albedo shapes have been allowed to remain on many old names, but often they are removed and renewed according to the new information of the nature of the shapes
 udhaaharan ke liye, nix olampika ho gaya olympus mons 
 The surface of Mars is divided into two types of regions with different albido
 raktim louh oxide se samrudh baaluu or dhul se aachhadit maidaanon ko arabia terra yaa amezonis planesia naam diya gaya
 These plains were once considered like the 'continents' of Mars
 shyaam akritiyon ko samudr hona samajha jaataa tha, isliye unke naam meyar erithreyam, meyar sirenum or aurora sinas he
 The largest black figure seen on Earth is the Sertris Major Planum
 sthaayee uttari dhruviya barf topi planam boreyam ke naam par he, jabaki dakshini topi ko planam australe kaha jaataa he
 The equinoctial of Mars is defined by its rotation, but its principal meridian was determined by the choice of an arbitrary point, just as Greenwich of the Earth; In 1830, Madler and Beer selected a line for their first map of Mars
 1972 main antariksh yaan meriner 9 kii pahunch ne mangal ke vyapak chithran pradaan kiye, uske baad sinas meridian main sthit ek chote se cretar ko mul chunaav ke saath mail ke liye 0
0° deshaantar kii paribhaasha ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 Since there is no ocean on Mars, there is also no 'sea level' and a zero-elevation surface had to be selected as the reference level as well; It is also called the Aeroid of Mars , corresponding to fine terrestrial geoids
 shunya ucchatansh ko us unchai dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he jahaan par 610
5 pascal kaa vayumandaleey dabaav he
 This pressure corresponds to the triple point of water and is about 0
6% of the surface level surface pressure on Earth

 PLC anuprayog aamtaur par atyadhik anukulit system hote hai isliye ek sankul PLC kii keemat ek vishisht anukulit rup se bane niyantrak dizine kii keemat kii tulana main kam hoti he
 On the other hand, in the case of surplus-produced materials, customized control systems are economical because of the low price of the components, which can be chosen optimally rather than as a "normal" solution and where non-recursive engineering costs thousands or millions of units

 ucch maatra ke yaa bahut aasaan nirdhaarit swachaalan kaaryon ke liye vibhinn takneekon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 For example, a consumer dishwasher would be controlled by an electro-mechanical chem timer, which would cost only a few dollars in production volume

 Automotive application is an example, millions of units are created each year and very few end users change the programming of these controllers
 haalanki, kuch vishesh parivahan jaise tronsit basen vishisht rup se dizine kiye niyantranon kii bajaay kifayati PLC kaa upyog karti hai, kyunki inaki maatra kam hoti he or vikaas kii laagat alabhakar hogi
 Very complex process controls, such as those used in the chemical industry, may require demonstration of algorithms and even beyond the capability of high-performance plcs
 bahut ucch gati yaa sateek niyantran ko bhi anukulit samaadhaan kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati hai, udhaaharan ke liye, vimaan udaan niyantran
 Programmable controllers are widely used in motion control, placement control and torque control
 kuch nirmaataa PLC ke saath sankalit karne ke liye gati niyantran ikaayiyon kaa utpaadan karte hai taaki G-code mashin kii gatividhiyon ko aadesh dene main istemaal kiya ja sake
 PLC may include logic, a "proportional, whole, derivatives" or "PID controller" for a single-variable feedback analog control loop
 jaise, ek PID loop ek vinirmaan prakriya ke taapmaana ko niyantrit karne main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Historically, plcs were generally configured with only a few analog control loops, where processes required hundreds or thousands of loops, instead a distributed control system would be used
 As plcs have become more powerful, the boundary between DCS and PLC applications has become less clear
 PLC main sudur terminal ikaayiyon vaali saamaan kaaryakshmata he
 An RTU, however, generally does not support control algorithms or control loops
 As hardware becomes increasingly more powerful and cheaper, rtus plcs and dcss are increasingly beginning to take over responsibilities and many vendors are selling rtus with plc-like features and vice versa
 The industry has standardized the IEC 61131-3 functional block language to create programs running on rtus and plcs, although nearly all vendors also provide proprietary options and related development environments

 Discrete signals are sent using either voltage, or power, where a specific range is assigned as ON and the second OFF
 For example, a PLC may possibly use 24 v DC i / O, with values above 22 v DC indicating ON, values below 2VDC off, and intermediate values uncertain
 shuru main, PLC ke paas keval asatat i / o tha
 Analog signals are like volume controls, with a line of values between zero and full scale

 Because plcs typically use 16-bit symbolic binary processors, integer values are limited to between -32,768 and +32,767
 dabaav, taapmaana, pravaah or vajan aksar analog sanketon dwaara darshaae jate hai
 Analog signals can use a voltage or power of gravity proportional to the value of the process signal
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek analog 4-20 ma yaa 0 - 10 v nivesh 0 - 32767 ke ek purnank mulya main parivartit kiya jayega
 Current inputs are less sensitive than voltage inputs, with respect to electric noise
 udahaaran ke rup main, maan lo ek suvidha ko ek tanks main pani ikattha karne kii zarurat he
 When needed, water is drawn from the tank by another system and our example system is required to manage the water level of the tank
 keval digital sanketon kaa upyog karte hue, PLA ke paas flot switch se do digital nivesh hai 
 jab pani kaa str switch se upar hota he to vah ek sampark band kar detaa he or sanket ek nivesh ko bhej detaa he
 The PLC uses a digital output to open and close the entry valve in the tank
 jab pani kaa str kaaphi neeche ho jaataa he jisase neeche ke str kaa flot switch band ho jaye, tab PLC valve khol degaa taaki or pani andar aa jaye
 ek baar pani kaa str itnaa upar aa jaye taaki upar ke str kaa switch chaalu ho jaye, to PLC pani ko baahar bahane se rokane ke liye pravesh ko band kar degaa
 This staircase is an example of seal-in logic
 yah nirgam tab band rahata he jab tak koi paristhiti circuit ko tod nahin detii
 An analogous system can use a water tightness sensor or an adjustable adjustable dripping out of a heavy cell and a tank, the valve slowly adjusting the water back into the tank
 is system main 'fluter' samanjan, jo valve ko tod sakate hai, unhen rokane ke liye, PLC "haisatarasis" ko sammilit karti hai, jo multah gatividhi kaa ek "deadband" banaata he
 If a technician adjusts this deadband, the valve moves only for a significant change in rate
 yah badale main valve kii gati ko kam karata he, jisase isaki ragad kam ho jaati he
 a real system can combine both approaches, using float switches and simple valves to prevent spillage and a rate sensor and rate valve to optimize the refill rate and prevent water hammer
 bedap or rakrakhaav ke tareeke ek asli system ko bahut jatil bana sakate hai
