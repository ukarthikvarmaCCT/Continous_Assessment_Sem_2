 mahavir singh phogot pehle ek pahalwaan rahata he, lekin acchhee naukari ke liye kushti chhod diya rahata he
 Due to this, his dream of winning a gold medal for India also remains incomplete
 iske baad vah sochataa he ki uskaa adhuraa sapana uskaa betaa puraa karegaa
 But he is frustrated by having four consecutive daughters at his home
 kyonki use lagata he ki ladakiyon ko kushti nahin balki ghar ke kaaryon ko siikhnaa chahie
 But when his elder daughters, Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat, meet and beat the boys who make derogatory remarks on them, they see a future wrestler in them
 mahavir un donon ko kushti sikhaane lagata he
 Initially, she learns a lot of anger at her father by learning through harsh methods, cutting her hair, exercising early in the morning, etc
 But soon she realizes that her father only gives her to housewives They are doing all this not to spend life in the form, but to show some tax for the country
 iske baad wo donon khushi se mahavir se kushti ke daanv-pench sikhte hai
 Mahavir also takes them to the competition, in which Geeta and Babita together beat many boys
 pratiyogitaaon ko jitate hue gita ko patiala main prashikshan lene kaa mauka miltaa he

 She used to watch TV all the time, eat street food and had long hair
 us santhaan ke shikshak kaa takanic uske pita ke takanic se thodaa alag tha, or gita ko lagata tha ki uske shikshak kaa takanic uske pita ke takanic se bahut acha he jabaki uske pita kii takanic puraani ho chuki he
 When she returns home, she fights with the technique taught at the institute instead of her father's taught technique
 iske baad mahavir or gita main mukkebaaji hoti he or apane badhati umr ke kaaran mahavir usase haar jaataa he
 Babita tells her sister Geeta that the place she is in now is due to her father's technique and she should not forget her father's technique
 gita kii tarah babita bhi us santhaan main chale jaati he
 Geeta continues to lose every match, because she does not pay full attention to the technique or wrestling taught by her father
 usne apane nakhun badha liye rahete hai or rang bhi laga rakhaa hota he saath main apane baalo ko bhi kaaphi lanbaa rakhen hone kaaran bhi use haar kaa saamana karnaa padate rahata he
 She realizes her mistake and she reveals this to Mahavir
 mahavir uske santhaan main aa kar un donon ko prashikshan dene lagata he
 But when the teacher teaching in that institution comes to know about this, he complains to get them both out
 uske baad yah nirnay hua ki un donon ko santhaan main tabhi rakhaa ja saktaa he jab mahavir santhaan main na aae or un donon ko kahin koi prashikshan na de
 Mahavir then watches Geeta's old video in which she loses and tells Geeta about her mistake by phone
 komanwealth khelon main gita hissaa le leti he or mahavir uske coach ke nirdeshon ke vipareet darshakon ke saath baith jaataa he
 Geeta does not fight against the methods taught by her coach and fights in the ways taught by her father and wins every time
 us coach ko mahavir se jalan hone lagati he or is kaaran vah mahavir ko ek kamare main band kar detaa he

 Indian sociologist M
N
 Srinivas popularized in the 1950s
 haalaanki iske isse puraane ullekh bhimrao ambedkar krit casts in india: dir mechainizam, jenessis and develpment main mil sakate hai
 The earliest references to this process of "walking upward and downward in the social ladder" are found in another reference, "the Laws of Imitation", written by Gabriel Tarde
 shrinivas ne samskruthikaran kii paribhaasha dete hue kaha ki "is prakriya main nichali yaa madhyam hindu jati yaa janajati yaa koi anya samooh, apni prathaon, ritiyon or jeevanstyli ko ucch yaa praayah dwij jatiyon kii disha main badal lete hai
 Often, with such a change, they also become claimants of a higher status in the caste system than that which the local community has traditionally offered them



 " a clear example of Sanskritisation is the adoption of pure vegetarianism by the people of the so-called "lower castes", in imitation of the Dwij castes, which are not traditionally opposed to non-vegetarian food
 em

 shrinivas ke anusaar, samskruthikaran keval nayi prathaon or aadaton kaa angikaar karnaa hi nahin he, balki sanskrit vaanmay main vidyaman naye vichaaron or mulyon ke saath saakshaatkaar karnaa bhi isamen aa jaataa he
 They say that karma, dharma, sin, maya, samsara, moksha etc
 are such ideas present in Sanskrit literature which become common in the lore of Sanskritized people
 yah parighatna nepal main bhi khaas, magar, nevaar, tharu logon main dekhi gayi he
 Srinivas first developed this theory in his d-film at Oxford University
 Given in the thesis of
 baad main yah siddhanth ek pustak ke rup main laayaa gaya jiskaa sheershak tha- "religen and sosayti amang da kurgs of south india" 
 The book was an anthropological study of the Kodava community of Karnataka
 shrinivas ne pustak main likhaa: "the caste system is far from a rigid system in which the position of each component caste is fixed for all time
 Movement has always been possible, and especially in the middle regions of the hierarchy
 a caste was able, in a generation or two , to rise to a higher position in the hierarchy by adopting vegetarianism and teetotalism, and by Sanskritizing its ritual and pantheon
 In short, it took over, as far as possible, the customs, rites, and beliefs of the Brahmins, and adoption of The Brahminic way of life by a low caste seems to have been frequent, though theoretically forbidden
 This process has been called 'sanskritization' in this book, in preference to 'brahminization', as certain Vedic rites are confined to the Brahmins and the two other 'twice-born' castes
 " is pustak ne tab chal rahe is vichaar ko chunauti di ki jati ek drudh or aparivartansheel sanstha he
 The concept of Sanskritisation helped in subjects like complexity of castes
 saath hi isane bharat main vibhinn jatiyon or samudaayon dwaara apane darje par punarvichaar karwaane kii gatiki ko bhi academik prakaash main laa diya
 The term Sanskritization is also used for this concept in many places in Hindi, which is impure in terms of Sanskrit rules

 In this way, rodents are divided into three subgroups: 1
 syuromorpha arthath gilahari sadrush kritak, 2
 Myomorpha, ie rodents like rodents and 3
 histricomorpha arthath saahi ke anuroop krintak
 The characteristic features of this sub-class are: One, they have two tibiae in their upper jaws and only one in the lower jaw and the other one has chorion, which does not pass through the axilla
 krintakon ke is aadyatam upagan main gilahariyon, udanevaali gilahariyon tathaa oodon ke atirikt civelel jaise bahut hi puraatan krintak tathaa puranuthan yug ke pracheenatam ashmibhoot krintak bhi rakhe jate hai
 Not only this, there are also some such lineages of rodents whose relatives are uncertain
 syuromorpha main krintakon ke 13 kul rakhe gaye hai
 All the animals housed in the clan called Ischeromide are found in the strata of Eurasia and North America from the Old to Middle Ages
 is vansh kaa ek udhaaharan paramis he, jo puranuthan se pradinuthan yugon tak ke prastarastaron main paaya gaya he

 In this subgroup, the central part of the muscle of the enumerated rodents passes through the akshyadh: kulya
 is upagan main kam se kam 200 jatiyon tathaa lagbhag 700 jaaton ke krintak aate hai
 Thus, it is the largest group of animals in modern mammals
 yahi nahin, anek drushtiyon se ham is pranismooh ko stanadhariyon main sarvaadhik safal bhi pate hai
 Examples of rodents that fall into this subgroup are: Chapalakhu of Dipodidae clan; Shadraush Moosh, Mrigakhu and Sanyati of Chrysatidae Kul; Mush, rodents, swamukars, kshetramika, etc
 of the Muाइridi clan and plutumers of the Zepāidi clan
 inke atirikt is upagan main paanch kul or bhi hai
 These creatures have adapted themselves to almost all types of environments
 kuch sthalchari hai, kuch upsthalchari, kuch vrikshashreey hai, kuch daud main tej kudate hue chalate hai, kuch uddyi hote hai or kuch jalchaari hote hai
 This subgroup is also a fairly large subgroup of rodents, with 19 total

 The rest of the rodents of this subgroup are confined in South America, except for the Otter of Asia and Africa and some different varieties of North America
 yahi nahin, is upagan ke praaniyon ke jeevashm bhi dakshini america ke adinuthan yug main hi mili hai
 Each animal of this subgroup is of great importance to scientists

 rafi sahab iske kilaaf the or unka kahana tha ki ek baar gane record ho gaye or gayak-gayikaon ko unki fees kaa bhugtan kar diya gaya ho to unako or paison kii aashaa nahin kerani chahie
 There was a conflict between the two great artists about this
 lata ne rafi ke saath set par gane se manaa kar diya or barason tak dono kaa koi yugal geet nahin aayaa
 Later, at the behest of actress Nargis, both of them started singing together and sang Dil Pukare in the Jewel Thief film
 unka dehant 31 july 1980 ko hridaygati ruk janeke kaaran hua
 There is some controversy over how many songs Rafi sang in his life
 1970 ke dashak main gineez book of world ricards ne likhaa ki sabase adhik gane ricard karne kaa shrey lata mangeshkar ko praapt he, jinhone kul 25,000 gane ricard kiye hai
 Rafi wrote a letter to the Guinness Book, refuting it
 iske baad ke sanskarnon main gineez book ne donon gayakon ke daawey saath-saath pradarshit kiye or mohammad rafi ko 1944 or 1980 ke bich 28,000 gane ricard karne kaa shrey diya
 In the subsequent search, Vishwas Nerurkar found that Lata had actually sung only 5,044 songs till 1989
 anya shodhakartaaon ne bhi is tathy ko sahi mana he
 Additionally, Raju Bharatan found that between 1948 and 1987 only 35,000 Hindi songs were recorded
 aise main rafi ne 28,000 gane gaae is baat par yakeen karnaa mushkil he, lekin kuch strot ab bhi is sankhya ko uddhrut karte hai
 After this research, in 1992, the Guinness Book removed the above record of singing from the book

 Winner of Nobel Prize in Literature in 1939
 emil silampa kaa janm 16 sitambar 1888 ko ek behad garib parivaar main hua
 The father was a daily wage laborer and the mother a maid
 garibi kii haalat yah thi ki finland ke bhayanak sardi vaale vaataavaran main paala padane se unki maamuli fasalein, beej or paaltu pashu hi nahin kai bachche bhi maare gaye or kudarat ke chamatkaar se sirf silampa hi batch paae
 The boy Silampa received an itinerant school in which elementary education took place
 padhai main hoshiyaar silampa ko jaldi hi ek niyamit vidhyalay mil gaya or gaadi chal padi
 For good education, people advised to send the child outside and the parents cut the stomach and sent the son to the city to study
 silampa ne achche ankon se 1908 main metric paas kii or kisi dayaalu aadmi kii dariyaadilii ke chalate helsinki vishvavidhyalay main jeev- vigyaan kii padhai shuru kar di
 While working in university, Silampa got involved in studies, got the respect of writers, artisans and intellectual friends and started reading books apart from the syllabus
 paanch saal baad silampa ko pataa chalata he ki abhi parikshaayen dur hai or daandaata ab sahaayta karne main bilkul asamarth he
 When he returned to Silampa village with the remaining amount, he saw the parents are spending the day in worse conditions
 betaa ab maa-baap ke saath rahane laga or kuch madad karne kii sochane laga
 Supporting the work of parents, Silampa one day bought paper-envelopes to write from the village of the neighborhood and wrote a story from the pseudonym and sent it to a big newspaper in the nearby town
 chamatkaar kii tarah kahani akhbaar ke mukhaprishth par chhapi or mehtaanaa alag mila
 In that newspaper, the process of writing with a pseudonym started and the discussion of a new talented writer became common, it was too late to find it
 jald hi logon ne yuva lekhak sillanpa ko dhundh nikaala
 a publisher came forward and signed Silampa to write a book by giving an advance amount
 aise hi chamatkaaron se bhare silampa ke jivan main 1914 main ek gaanv main ek nrity ke dauraan ek ladki sigrid maaria milti he, jo naukaraani kaa kaam karti he
 Maria and Sillanpa fall in love and in 1916 the two get married
 pachchis varshon ke safal vaivaahik jivan main maaria aath bacchon kii maa banati he

 vastutah suomi bhashaa ko bhi vaishvik str par par pehali baar tab janaa gaya, jab 1939 main silampa ko nobel puraskaar pradaan kiya gaya

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The history of Hinduism is very ancient
 is dharm ko vedakaal se bhi purv kaa mana jaataa he, kyonki vaidic kaal or vedon kii rachana kaa kaal alag-alag mana jaataa he
 The oral tradition continued here for centuries, through which its history and texts continued to move forward
 uske baad ise lipibaddh karne kaa kaal bhi bahut lanbaa rahaa he
 Vedas are the most sacred texts of Hinduism
 vedon kii rachana kisi ek kaal main nahin hui
 Scholars started the creation of Vedas in 2000 BC
 It is assumed from yani yah dhire-dhire rache gaye or antat: pehle veda ko teen bhaagon main sankalit kiya gaya- rugveda, yajurveda or samaveda jise vedatrayee kaha jaataa tha
 It is believed that the split of the Vedas took place during the time of Pururava Rishi before Rama's birth
 baad main atharvaveda kaa sankalan rishi atharva dwaara kiya gaya
 At the same time, according to another belief, during the time of Krishna, Ved Vyas composed and scripted the Vedas
 hindu or jain dharm kii utpatti purv aaryon kii avadharana main he jo 4500 i

pus
, isai dharm sirf do hajaar varsh purv, islam dharm aaj se 1400 varsh purv hua
 According to religious literature, there are some other concepts of Hinduism
 ramayana, mahabharat or puraanon main surya or chandravanshi raajaaon kii vansh parampara kaa ullekh uplabdh he
 Apart from this, there is a description of the origin and tradition of many dynasties
 ukt sabhi ko itihaas sammat krambaddh likhnaa bahut hi kathin kaary he, kyonki puraanon main ukt itihaas ko alag-alag tarah se vyakt kiya gaya he jiske kaaran iske sutron main bikharaav or bhram nirmit jaan padataa he, phir bhi dharm ke gyaataaon ke liye yah bhram nahin he
 In fact, Hindus kept their history alive by singing, rote and based on sources
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki vah itihaas dhire-dhire kavyamay or shringaarik hota gaya jise aadhunik log itihaas maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 It was a time when there was no paper and pen
 itihaas likhaa jaataa tha shilaon par, pattharon par or man par
 Before reading the history texts of Hinduism, there is a reference to the tradition of Manus before the tradition of sages and sages, who have been called Kulkars in Jainism
 aise kramash: 14 manu maane gaye hai jinhone samaaj ko sabhy or takneekee sampann banane ke liye athak prayaas kiye
 The name of the first man of the earth was Swayambhu Manu and the first woman was Satarupa, in the Mahabharata, eight manu are mentioned
 is vakt dharti par aathven manu vaiwaswath kii hi santaanen hai
 Eighth Manu was the Matsya avatar of Lord Vishnu at the time of Vaivaswat
 puraanon main hindu itihaas kaa aarambh sristi utpatti se hi mana jaataa he
 To say that this started from here may not be appropriate, yet there is a mention in Hindu history texts Mahabharata and Puranas from Manu to the generation of Lord Krishna
 hindu dharm lagbhag 5000 saal se vyavasthit viksit hua he or saat charnon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he ki doorabeen ek-duusare main he
 Some Hindutva advocates would believe that Hinduism was revealed to the sages in its entirety by the end of the Ice Age 12,000 years ago
 hindutv ke itihaas main, puranic kathaayen sirf samay-samay par itihaas he, itihaaskaar gananaa nahin kar sakate yaa nahin
 In recent times, Hinduism has been described as an "open source religion", unique in that it has no defined founder or doctrine, and its ideas constantly evolve in response to historical and geographical realities
 yah kai sahaayak nadiyon or shakhaon ke saath ek nadi ke rup main sabase acha varnit he, hindutv shakhaon main se ek he, or vartmaan main bahut shaktishaalee he, kai log swayan ko nadi ke rup main maanate hai
 About 5000 years ago, in the Bronze Age, now called the Harappan Indus Valley Civilization, which is characteristic of brick cities, reached the vast area of the Indus river valley over the Ganges for nearly a thousand years
 samtal in shaharon main, ham un chitron ke saath mitti kii javaanon ko khojate hai jo vartmaan hindu prakruti kii bahut adhik hissaa hai jaise pipel vriksh, bail, swastika, saat daasi, or ek aadmi jo yoga mudra main baitha he
 We do not know much about this stage because language remains to be understood
 3,500 saal pehle, louh yug main, vaidic bhajanon or anushthanon se pataa chalaa ja saktaa he jisamen hadappa ke vichaaron ke nishaan hote hai, lekin ek sthai shahari jivan style kii bajaay ek khanaabadosh or gramin jivan style ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 Some Hindutva advocates completely disagree and insist that the two stages are actually one
 is charan main, hamen ek vishvadrushti milti he jo bhautik duniya kaa jashn manaati he, jahaan ishwaron ko anushthanon ke saath pesh kiya jaataa he, or swasthya or dhan, samruddhi or shanti pradaan karne ko kaha jaataa he
 This aspect of inviting the gods and receiving favor from them continues to this day, although these rituals vary
 vedon ne sindhu se apper ganga or nichle ganga maidaanon main ek kramik failaav prakat kiya he
 Some Hindutva scholars refute such geographical spread and insist on the subcontinent to have advanced, such as fully developed, homogenous, urban Vedic culture, plastic surgery and even airplanes since ancient times
 tisare charan main 2,500 saal pehle upanishad ke rup main janaa jaataa granthon ke saath, jahaan anushthanon kii tulana main aatmanirikshan or dhyaan par adhik mahatv diya gaya tha, or ham punarjanm, mathvaad, janm or mrityu ke chakra se mukti jaise vichaaron par adhik dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 This phase saw the rise of shamanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism, its followers spoke in Pali and Prakrit and also rejected the Vedic form and the Vedic language, Sanskrit
 isamen brahman pujaariyon ne bhi dharm-shastron kii rachana ke madhyam se vaidic vichaaron ko punargathit kiya, kitaaben jo ki shaadi ke madhyam se saamaajik jivan ko viniyamit karne or paarit hone ke anushthan par dhyaan kendrit karti hai, or logon ke dayitvon ko unke purvajon, unki jati or vishwa par nirbhar karata he
 vast
 kai shikshavid vaidic vichaaron ke is sanghathan kaa varnan karne ke liye brahmanwad kaa prayog karte hai or ise ek mul rup se pitrusattatmak or magasivadi bal ke rup main dekhte hai jo samtawadi or shantivaadee mathon ke adeshon ke saath hinsak rup se pratispardhaa karte hai
 Buddhism and Jainism, along with Vedic practices and beliefs, spread from North India to South India, and eventually from the subcontinent to Central Asia and to Southeast Asia
 dakshin main, tamil sangam samskruti kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha, us jaankaree ke bare main jo praarambhik kavitaaon ke sangrah se aate hai, jo vaidic anushthanon ke kuch gyaan or buddha dharm or jain dharm ke gyaan ke saath baad main mahakavyon kaa pataa chalata he
 Some Hindutva scholars say that there was no separate Tamil Sangam culture
 yah puri tarah se viksit, samroop, shahari vaidic samskruti kaa hissaa tha, jahaan sabhi ne sanskrit ko bolaa tha
 The fourth phase saw the rise of writings such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Purana, which began 2,000 years ago, where stories are used to reconcile the worldview of domestic and world relations and create the now familiar Hindu worldview
 hamen ek puri tarah se viksit puranic kathaon ke liye pesh kiya jaataa he jahaan vishwa kii koi shuruyaat nahin he yaa ant, kai akaash or kai hello ke saath, kriya or pratikriya dwaara niyantrit, jahaan sabhi samaaj janm or mrityu ke chakron ke madhyam se jate hai, bas sabhi jivit praaniyon kii tarah is charan main mandiron or mandir anushthanon kaa udai hua
 We also see the rise of the monastic Vedantic orders that corrupt the body and everything sensory, as well as the Jap tantric orders, corrupting the body and exploring the body and all things
 ham puraane nigama parampara ke mingling bhi dekh sakate hai, jahaan divyata ko nae agma parampara ke saath niraakaar mana jaataa he, jahaan paramatma shiv or uske putron, vishnu or unke avatar, or devi or uske kai roopon kaa rup lete hai
 With the emergence of new orders and traditions, we also see consolidation of the caste system, which is not a community group based on occupations, which distinguishes itself from not being interim
 kai shikshavidon ne jati ko hindu dharm kii ek aavashyak visheshta ke rup main dekha he jo ucch jatiyon ke paksh main he, jis par aarope he ki hindutv asweekaar karte hai
 Many Hindutva scholars maintain that caste has a scientific and rational basis, and has nothing to do with politics or economics
 paanchvaan charan 1,000 varsh purana he, or yah ek siddhant ke rup main bhakthi kaa udai dekha, jahaan bhakt bhavuk geeton ke madhyam se devataaon se jude hue hai, jo kshetreey bhashaaon main bana he, aksar mandir pranali ko darkinar karte hai
 This was a time when a rigid caste hierarchy firmly asserted itself, based on the principle of holiness and some castes being viewed as inauspicious and inept
 unhen bhi samudaay se acchhee tarah se vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa he yah bhi vah samay he jab islam bharat main pravesh karata he, shantipurvak samudr ke vyapaariyon ke madhyam se dakshin main or madhya asian saradaaron ke madhyam se hinsak rup se uttar main jaataa he, jo buddha mathon or hindu mandiron ko nasht karte hai, jo raajnneetik satta ke centre bhi hote hai or antat unke shashan kii sthapana karte hai, aksar hindu raajaaon jaise uttar main rajput, purab main ahoms, maraathon or dakkan main vijaynagar samrajya kaa virodh karte the
 Hindutva saw the arrival of Islam and the rise of the Delhi and Deccan Sultanates, the latter marking the end of Mughal rule as the end of great Hindu culture, a subject that Marxist historians have made crazy communal propaganda
 baad main keval hindu-islamic sahyog ko ujagar kiya gaya, jo anya charam par ja rahaa he, gaiyr-marxvaadi itihaaskaaron kaa tark he The sixth phase is 300 years old when Hinduism answers the rise of European power in the subcontinent, and the resulting arrival of Christian missionaries and rational scientific discourse
 kuch hindutv vidwaan, donon ke bich antar nahin karte hai
 European scholars in this era tried to make sense of Hinduism using both scientific methods and a judeo-christian lens
 unke liye, akeshwarwad sachcha dharm or vaigyanik tha; bahudevvaad murtipujak puranic kathaon tha unhone hindu jivan style ke anuwaad or dastavejikaran kaa ek vishaal abhyaas shuru kiya

 Acids, solids, liquids or gases can be found in any physical state
 ve shuddh rup main yaa ghol ke rup main rah sakate hai
 The substance or compound in which the properties of acids are found are called
 maanav antra main hydrochloric amla kii adhikta se hone vaali beemaari ko amlata yaa acidity kehete hai
 Acids are substances that are sour in taste when dissolved in water, turn a roly made from turmeric to yellow, and their aqueous solution turns blue litmus paper red
 adhikansh dhaatuon par abhikriya karke hydrogen gas utpann karte hai, or ksharak ko udasin kar dete hai
 Fatty bases are those substances whose solution looks smooth, tastes bitter, turns turmeric red and neutralizes acids
 udasin karne kaa arth he aise padaarth kaa bananaa jisamen na amla ke gun hote hai, na ksharak ke
 While studying the properties of oxygen, Lavazi observed that when oxides like carbon, sulfur and phosphorus are burned in oxygen, the oxides made from them form acids with water
 ve is parinaam par pahunche ki amlon main oxygen rahata he or amlon kii amleeyta kaa kaaran oxygen he
 For this reason, this gas was named "oxygen", which means "acidifier" and for this reason, in the German language, Oxygen is called "sire stuff"
 lavaazie ne hi amlon ko do virgon, acarbonic amalon or carbonic amlon main vibhakt kiya tha
 It was seen that oxides of some elements dissolve in water to form not alkalis but alkalis and some acids do not contain oxygen at all
 bertile ne san 1787 main hydrosienic amla, davy ne san 1810-11 main hydrochloric amla or san 1813 main hydrodic amla kaa avishkaar kiya
 There is no oxygen in any of them
 aage chalakar dekha gaya he ki jo padaarth bilkul sookhe hote hai, unamem koi amleey abhikriya nahin hoti
 Then people divided the acids into two classes, one hydro-acid and the other oxy-acid
 peeche san 1815 main davy ne suzav rakhaa ki amlon kii amleeyta oxygen ke kaaran nahin, varan hydrogen ke kaaran he
 Dulang studied oxalic acid in 1815 and came to the conclusion that there is no difference between oxygenated and non-oxygenated acids
 amlon main koi aisa gun nahin he jise ham amlon kaa vishisht lakshan kah saken
 Common properties have been stated above
 amla or dhaatu kii abhikriya main amla ke anu kaa ek, yaa ek se adhik, hydrogen parmaanu dhaatuon, dhaatuon ke oxidon, hydroxidon athwa carboneton se visthapit ho jaataa he
 There are also some acids that are sweet instead of sour
 aisa ek amla amido-fosphrik amla he
 There are some acids which are not alkaline
 kuch aise bhi kshar hai jinka hydrogen dhaatuon se visthapit ho jaataa he
 Alum is not acid
 isamen visthapit honevaala koi hydrogen bhi nahin he
 But it is sour in taste and alkali in action
 yah nile litmus ko laal bhi kar detaa he
 Similarly sodium bisulfide is sour and alkali
 yah nile litmus ko laal karata he
 It also has displacing hydrogen, but it is not acid
 mithen amla nahin he, par iskaa hydrogen jaste se visthapit ho jaataa he or is prakaar zinc diemethil banataa he jo lavan nahin he
 Therefore, no satisfactory definition of acid has yet been given
 aayan siddhant ke aadhaar par yadi ham amlon kii paribhaasha dena chahen to kah sakate hai ki amlon main hydrogen yanon kaa rahanaa atyaavashyak he
 In 1659, Silvian first differentiated into acids and bases
 rule ne san 1774 main ksharak naam us padaarth ko diya jo amlon ke saath milakar lavan banaata he
 Nowadays, bases are those oxygen-rich substances that are supplemented by acids
 kshar dhaatuon, kshariyamruda dhaatuon or anya dhaatuon ke oxide or ve sabhi vastuen ksharak hai jo amlon ke saath milakar lavan banaati hai
 Initially the base was applied only to metals or oxides of metals that were "bases" or bases of salts
 lavenon ke ksharak aavashyak avyav hai
 Bases are actually substances that combine with acids to form salts and water
 udhaahrant:, zinc oxide salphurik amla ke saath milakar zinc sulphate or jal banaata he
 Dahk soda combines with sulfuric acid to form sodium sulfate and water
 dhaatuon ke oxide saamanyat: ksharak hai
 But there are exceptions to this
 ksharakon main dhaatuon ke oxide or hydraksaide hai, par suvidha ke liye tatwon ke kuch aise samooh bhi rakhe gaye hai jo amlon ke saath milakar bina jal bane hi lavan banaate hai
 Among such bases are ammonia, hydroxylamine and phosphine
 drav ammonia ghul jaataa he par phinolfaileen se koi rang nahin detaa
 Thus, to what extent can it be called base, this thing is doubtful
 yadhyapi upar kii ksharak kii paribhaasha badi asantoshprad he, tathaapi isse acchhee paribhaasha nahin di ja saki he
 Base and base are not synonyms
 sab kshar ksharak hai par sab ksharak kshar nahin hai
 Alkali-metal oxides, such as sodium oxide, dissolve in water to form hydroxides
 ye prabal ksharkeey hote hai
 Alkaline soil metal oxides, such as calcium oxides, are soluble in water and less alkaline
 anya dhaatuon ke oxide jal main ghulte nahin or unke hydraksaide paroksh ritiyon se hi banaae jate hai
 Oxides and hydroxides of metals are basic
 kshar dhaatuon ke oxide jal main sheeghra ghul jate hai
