 The Sanskrit and Braj language texts throw more light on the religious significance of Braj, but some of them mention some natural and geographical location
 ye ullekh braj ke un bhakt kaviyon ke kritiyon main prastut he, jinhone 16veen shatee ke baad yahaan nivas kar apni rachanaayen strajit kii thi
 Some of them had tried to restore the importance of Braj by exploring lost sites and forgotten equipment
 aise manishi lekhakon main sarvashree rupagoswami, narayanbhatat, gangwal or jagatnand ke naam vishesh ullekhneey he
 Some important information related to this subject are described in Rupgoswami Krita - 'mathura Mahmatya', Narayanabhatta Krita - 'brajbhakti Vilas' and Jagatananda Krita - 'braj Vastu Deshna'
 braj pradesh yamuna nadi ke maidani bhaag main sthit he saadharantah yahaan kii bhoomi kaa nirmaan yamuna nadi ke dwaara vahaakar laai-gai mitti ke jamaav se sampann ho sakaa he
 The land here is usually flat
 yahaan kii bhoosatah kii samudratal se oonchaai lagbhag 600 feet he
 The northern part of Braj is more than 600 feet high while the southern part is less than 600 feet, so the slope of the land is from north to south and through it, the river Yamuna flows continuously from north to south direction
 bhu-sanrachana kii drushti se braj ko teen prakritik bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he - maidani bhaag patharilaa yaa pahari bhaag or khadar kaa bhaag
 The plains are wide which extends in both the east and west directions of the Yamun river
 pracheen kaal main is bhaag main yamuna ke donon ore bade-bade ban the jo atyadhik saghan the, jinke kaaran braj pradesh main atisay barsha hoti thi
 At that time this section was highly romantic and fertile
 pracheen banon ke nirantar kaate jane ke kaaran av yahaan varsha kam hone lagi he or rajisthani suukhaagrast registan kaa failaav idhar badhane laga he, jisase is kshetra kii jalwaayu or upaj par atyadhik pratikul prabhaav pad rahaa he
 However, the plain facing east of Yamuna remains more fertile as it is made of loam soil
 pashchim disha vaale maidani bhaag kii bhoomi baaloodaar or matiyaar he, atah yah purvi bhaag kii domat bhoomi kii apeksha kam upjau he
 The rocky and mountainous part is in the northwestern directions of Braj
 is bhaag main kai choti pahadiya sthit hai, jinka dharmik mahatv adhik he
 However, these are nominal hills because their actual elevation is around 100 feet
 braj kaa adhikansh bhaag yamuna nadi ke maidani bhaag me hone ke kaaran yahaan koi parvat or pahaad nahin hai
 As previously mentioned, there are some low hills in its western part, which exists in the broken position of Aravalli mountain ranges
 in nichi or saadhaaran pahadiyon ko inke dharmik mahatv ke kaaran hi 'giri' yaa parvat kaha jaataa he
 Braj has 5 mountains or hills as described by poet Jagatananda: • gobardhan • nandagaanv • barsaanaa • kambon • charan • tile This hill is located approximately miles west of Mathura Nagar
 isaki vaastavik oonchaai pahari samatuly nahin he, kintu iske anupam dharmik mahatv ke kaaran ise dharmasmmat kaviyon or lekhakon ne apane vivaranon main 'giriraaj' ke rup main varnit kiya he
 It is about 100 feet in height and about 5 miles in length
 aisi anushruti he ki isaki oonchaai pahile bahut adhik thi, kintu vah dhatate-dhatate itani kam adhishesh rah gai he
 Ancient Brihadavan was an extension of the ancient river extending up to Gobardhan and the river Yamuna flowed near it
 gargasamhita main gobardhan parvat kii vandana karte hue ise vrindavan main virajman or vrindavan kii god main nivas karne vaala golok kaa mukutamani kaha gaya he
 According to 2 mythological references, it was a very lush green mountain in the era of Lord Krishna
 isamen anek gupha athwa kadaraayen thi or unase sheethal jal ke anek jharne jhara karte the
 Braj-dwellers of that period used to graze their cows near him, so they looked at the said mountain with great reverence
 bhagwaan shri krishna ne indra kii paramparaagat puja band kar gobardhan kii puja braj main prachlit kii thi, jo uski upyogita ke liye unki shradhanjali thi
 The devout nobles of Braj, especially the Ballabh Sampradaya poets have expressed great reverence for Gobardhan
 ashtchhaap ke kaviyon ne giriraaj-govardhan ko radha-krishna kii keli-kridaaon kaa kendra vatalate hue uske prakritik saudarya kaa bhi bada hi bhavy varnan prastut kiya he
 Chaturbhuj Das has said - there is cool, dull, fragrant wind flows, beautiful waterfalls are springs, beautiful flowers and fruits blooming in all the objects remain
 3 anya kaviyon ne bhi iske sundar shikharon par vidhman naveen vanaspati, manoram dal, phool-fal tathaa pavitra jharanon kaa varnan prastut kiya he
 4 bhagwaan shri krishna ke kaal main indra ke prakope se ek baar braj main bhayankar varsha hui thi
 At that time, there was a possibility of the entire Braj getting submerged
 bhagwaan shri krishna ne us samay govardhan ke dwaara samast brajwasiyon kii raksha kii thi
 Devotees believe, Shri Krishna at that time, holding Govardhan like an umbrella, collected all the Brajwasi under him, that supernatural phenomenon has been mentioned in Puranadi religious texts and artifacts since very ancient times
 5 braj ke bhakt kaviyon ne uskaa bada ullaspurn kathan kiya he
 6 In today's scientific age, it is not possible to consider that supernatural phenomenon as the same
 uskaa buddhigamya abhipraay yah gyaat hota he ki shri krishna ke aadesh anusaar us samay brajvaasiyon ne govardhan kii kandaraon main aashray lekar varsha se apni jivan raksha kii thi
 The most important event of importance of Govardhan is that it is the only stable symbol of Lord Krishna's period
 us kaal kaa doosraa chinh yamuna nadi bhi he, kintu uskaa pravaah lagaataar parivartit hone se use sthai chinh nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 Millions of male and female come from all over India every year to visit Govardhan and visit him

 yah lagbhag 400 gaj lanbaa or lagbhag 10 feet unchaa pattharon kaa ek dher maatr he, kintu iske dharmik mahatv ke kaaran 'charan pahari' kaha jaataa he
 Devotees believe that here are the foot signs of Lord Shri Krishna
 braj main ek duusari charan pahari bhi he, jo kambon ke sameep sthit he, vahaan bhi bhagwaan shri krishna ke charan chinh hone kaa vishwaas kiya jaataa he
 Apart from the above mentioned five hills, there is also a small hill in the nearby high village of Barsane, which is called Sakhigiri
 usee ke sameep rankauli gram main bhi ek choti pahari he
 The description of these hills is not mentioned in the compositions of devout poets of Braj

 Gravity is the tendency of a material to be attracted towards one another
 gurutvkarshan ke bare main pehali baar koi ganitiya sutara dene kii koshish ijak newton dwaara kii gayi jo ascharyajanak rup se sahi tha
 He proposed the theory of gravity
 newton ke siddhanth ko baad main albert oinstin dwaara saapekshata siddhant se badla gaya
 Earlier Varah Mihir had said that only some kind of power keeps things sticking to the earth
 gurutvkarshan siddhant par aadhunik kaam 16 veen ke ant main or 17 veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main galileo galili ke kaam se shuru hua
 In his famous experiments used to drop balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later rotate the inclusions with careful measurement of the balls, Galileo showed that the gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects
 yah arestu ke vishwaas se ek bada prasthaan tha ki baari vastuon main ucch gurutvkarshan twaran hota he
 Galileo cited wind resistance as the reason that low-mass objects could fall into the atmosphere at a slower rate
 galileo ke kaam ne newton ke gurutv ke siddhant ke nirmaan ke liye manch taiyaar kiya Then Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the inverse square law of gravity
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The relation of the working force f between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravity constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated
 koi bhi vastu upar se girane par sidhi prithvi kii ore aati he
 It seems as if some untargeted and unknown power is pulling him towards the earth
 italy ke vaigyanik, gallilyyo gallilyaai ne sarvapratham is tathy par prakaash daalaa tha ki koi bhi pind jab upar se girtaa he tab vah ek niyat twaran se prithvi kii ore aata he
 This value of acceleration remains the same for all objects

 German astronomer Kepler gave three laws by studying the motion of planets
 kepler kaa pratham niyam: -sabhi grah surya ke chaaron ore dirghavrittakar kakshaon me chakkar lagate hai tathaa surya un kakshaon ke focus par hota he
 Second law - The line joining any planet to the Sun crosses the same area at the same time
 arthath prayek grah kii kshetreey chaal niyat rahati he
 That is, when the planet is away from the Sun, its speed decreases
 tritiy niyam : - prayek grah kaa surya kaa parikraman kaal kaa varg uski deergh vrittakar kaksha kii ardh-deergh aksh kii tritiy ghaat ke samaanupati hota he
 Gravity: "father, this earth, on which we dwell, rests upon?" Lilavati asked this question to her father Bhaskaracharya centuries ago
 iske uttar main bhaskaracharya ne kaha, "baale leelavati !, kuch log jo yah kehete hai ki yah prithvi sheshnag, kachua yaa hathi yaa anya kisi vastu par aadhaarit he to ve galat kehete hai
 Even if it is assumed that it rests on an object, the question remains, on which that object rests, and thus the cause of the cause and then its cause


 This sequence continues, then in jurisprudence This is called non-permanent defect
 leelavati ne kaha phir bhi yah prashn bana rahata he pitaaji ki prithvi kis cheez par tiki he? Then Bhaskaracharya said, why we cannot assume that the earth is not based on anything
 xxrep 5 
 yadi ham yah kahen ki prithvi apane hi bal se tiki he or ise gurutvkarshan shakti kah den to kya dosha he? Lilavati asked how this is possible
 tab bhaskaracharya siddhanth kii baat kehete hai ki vastuon kii shakti badi vicitra he
 Next says arthath prithvi main aakarshan shakti he
 Earth attracts heavy substances with its attraction power and due to attraction they fall to the ground

 Phishing is usually done by email spoofing or instant messaging, and users are often directed to enter their details on a fake website that has the same look and feel as the real website
 fishing imelon main mailaware se sankramit websiton kii kadiyaan ho sakati hai
 Phishing is an example of social engineering technology used to deceive users by taking advantage of the poor usability of current web security technologies

 wheling fishars isamen logo kii jaankaree email or vishesh softver ke madhyam se ekatrit kar lete he | Most methods of phishing use some technical deception designed to create links in a single email
 Misspelled urls or subdomains are commonly used by Fisher

 This type of attacks is known as cross-site scripting
 Instructs the user to sign in to their own bank or service's own web page, where everything from the web address appears correct
 In reality, the link to the website is designed to attack, thereby providing expert knowledge
 It is difficult to understand without ek saarvbhaumik emitiem fishing kit, 2007 main khoji gai, ek saadhaaran-se-upyog antarfalak pradaan karata he jo ek fisher ko websiton ko thos rup se pun: pesh karne or nakli site par darj kiye gaye log-in vivaranon ko capchar karne kii anumati detaa he
 To avoid anti-phishing techniques that scan websites for phishing-related text, phishers have started using flash-based websites
 ye asli website kii tarah dikhte hai, lekin ek multimedia object main text chhupaayen hue rahati he | Covert redirection is a subtle method for executing phishing attacks that make the link look legitimate, but actually redirects the victim to an attacker's website
 aamtaur par kisi prabhavit site ke domen ke aadhaar par log-in powep ke tahat kiya jaataa he
 It often uses open redirects in third-party application websites
 saamaanya fishing prayaason ko sthaan dena aasaan ho saktaa he kyonki durbhaavnapurna prishth kaa URL aamtaur par vaastavik site link se alag hoga
 For covert redirects, an attacker may use the actual website instead of corrupting the site with a malicious login popup dialog box

 These notifications may include email address, date of birth, contact and work history
 hamalavar melbox, online upasthiti or mitron kii suchi sahit adhik samvedansheel jaankaree praapt kar saktaa he
 Worse, the attacker can control and operate the user's account

 esemes fishing cellphone paath sandesh kaa upyog karata he taaki logon ko apni nijee jaankaree kaa khulaasa kiya ja sake
 Another attack is to successfully forward the customer to the bank's legitimate website, then set up a popup window at the top of the page to request credentials, leading many users to think that banks are requesting this sensitive information 
 yah vidhi chupchaap upyogkarta ko prabhavit site par rediarect karti he
 This technique operates in reverse for most phishing techniques, as it does not take the user directly to a fraudulent site, but instead loads a fake page into one of the browser's open tabs
 ek fisher nakli wireles network banaata he jo ek vaid saarvajanik network ke samaan dikhataa he jo ki hawaii addon, hotel yaa coffee kii dukaanon jaise saarvajanik sthanon main pai ja sakati he
 Whenever a person logs onto a fake network, fraudsters try to get password and / or credit card information

 At the beginning of World War II, there was a treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union, under which they divided Poland and the territory was occupied by the Soviet Union
 lekin 1941 main germany ne palat kar soviet sangh par hamalaa kar diya
 This led the Soviet Union to join the United States and Britain in a group of friendly powers and fought against Germany

 International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories
 
 adhikansh deshon main, yah sakal gharelu utpaada ke mahatvapurn ansh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 While international trade has been present for most of its history, its economic, social and political importance has begun to increase in recent centuries
 antarrashtriya vyapaar vyavastha par audyogikaran, unnat parivahan, vaishvikaran, bahurashtriya nigam or bahyasrot se kaarynishpaadan, in sabhi kaa vyapak prabhaav padataa he
 Increasing international trade is important for the continuation of globalization
 antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bina, desh sirf apni khud kii seemaa ke bheetar utpaadit maal or sevaaon tak simit rah jaaenge
 International trade is no different from domestic trade in principle because the motivation and behavior of the parties involved in a trade does not change fundamentally, regardless of whether the trade is cross-border or not
 mukhya antar yah he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar aam taur par gharelu vyapaar se adhik mahangaa he
 The reason for this is that a border usually imposes additional charges such as tariffs, periodic costs due to delays on the border and costs associated with country variations such as language, legal system or culture
 gharelu or antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bich ek or antar yah he ki puunji or shram jaise utpaadan kaarak aam taur par baahar kii tulana main deshon ke bheetar adhik gatisheel hote hai
 Thus international trade is mostly limited to the trade of goods and services and only on a small scale in trade of capital, labor or other factors of production
 In addition, trade in goods and services can act as a substitute for trade in production factors
 utpaadan kaa ek kaarak aayaat karne ke bajaay, ek desh maal aayaat kar saktaa he jo utpaadan ke kaarak kaa gahan istemaal kare or is prakaar sambandhit kaarak ko sammilit kar le
 ek udhaaharan he, china se sanyukt rajya america dwaara shram-pradhan vastuon kaa aayaat
 chini shram kaa aayaat karne ke bajaay america, china se aise maal aayaat kar rahaa he jise chini shram ke istemaal se utpaadit kiya gaya he
 International trade is also a branch of economics, which together with international finance forms the broad branch of international economics
 vyapaar kii paddati kaa purvanumaan lagane or prashulk jaisi vyapaar nitiyon ke prabhaav kaa vishleshan karne ke liye anek alag namoonay prastaavit kiye gaye hai
 The Ricardian model focuses on comparative advantage and is perhaps the most important concept in international trade theory
 ek ricardian model main, desh un chizon ke utpaadan main visheshgyata hasil karte hai jin chizon kaa utpaadan ve acha karte hai
 Unlike other models, the Ricardian framework predicts that countries will specialize instead of producing a wide range of goods
 iske alaava, ricardian model kaarak nidhi par sidhe vichaar nahin karata, jaise desh ke bheetar shram or puunji kii saapeksh maatra
 ricardin model kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki yah deshon ke bich praudyogiki bhinnataaon kii kalpana karata he
 The technology gap is easily incorporated into the Ricardian and ricardo-sraffa models
 ricardian model nimnlikhit anumaan lagaataa he: The Ricardian model makes short-term measurements, so the technology varies internationally
 yah is tathy kaa samarthan karata he ki desh apane tulanaatmak laabh kaa paalan karte hai or visheshgyata ke liye anumati dete hai
 The Ricardian business model was studied by Graham, Jones, Mackenzie and others
 sabhi siddhanton main madhyavarti maal, vasteen or puunjigat maal jaise vyapaarit input maal ko baahar rakhaa gaya
 mckenzie, Jones, and Samuelson emphasized that considerable profits would be lost by the exclusion of intermediate goods from trade
 In a famous comment Mackenzie stated that "the idea of a moment would explain to a person that Lancashire would be unlikely to produce cotton cloth if cotton had to be grown in England
" haal hi main, is siddhant ko vistaarit karte hue isamen vyapaarik madhyavarti maamle ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 Thus the "labor only" assumption was removed from the theory
 is prakaar nayaa ricardian siddhant, jise kabhi-kabhi ricardo-srapha model kaa naam bhi diya jaataa he, saidhantik rup se puunjigat vastuon ko shaamil karata he jaise mashine or samagriyaan, jinka deshon ke bich kaarobaar hota he
 In times of global trade, this assumption is more realistic than the heckscher-olin model, which assumes that capital is stable within the country and not internationally dynamic
 1900 ke dashak ke armbh main, do swedish arthshaastriyon, eli heksher or bertil olin ne kaarak anupaat siddhant naam ke ek antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant kaa srijan kiya
 This theory is also called the heckscher-olin theory
 heksher-olin siddhant is baat par jor detaa he ki deshon ko aise maal kaa utpaadan or niryaat karnaa chahie jise aise sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho, jo prachur hon or aise maal kaa aayaat karnaa chahie jise alp-aapurti vaale sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho
 This theory differs from the theories of comparative advantage and absolute advantage because these theories focus on the productivity of the production process for a particular commodity
 iske vipareet, heksher-olin siddhant kahata he ki ek desh ko utpaadan or niryaat main un karkon kaa upyog karte hue visheshgy hona chahie jo sabase prachur maatra main hon or isliye saste hon
 un maal kaa utpaadan naa karen, jaisaa ki pehle ke siddhanton ne kaha, jo ve sabase adhik kushalta se utpaadit karte hai
 The Heckscher – Olin model was constructed as an alternative to the Ricardian model of basic comparative advantage
 isaki adhik jatilta ke baavjood yah apane purvanumaanon main adhik sateek sabit nahin hua
 But from a theoretical point of view it provides an elegant solution by incorporating neo-classical value mechanisms into international trade theory
 is siddhant kaa tark he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar kaa pattern, kaarak nidhi main antar se nirdhaarit hota he
 It predicts that countries will export goods that use locally abundant factors and will import goods that use factors that are locally scarce
 H-O model ke saath anubhavjanya samasyaayein, jise leontiff virodhabhas ke rup main janaa jaataa he, wesile leontiff dwaara anubhavjanya pareekshanon main saamne ain jinhone paaya ki puunji kii bahutayat hone ke baavjood america shram-pradhan maalon ko niryaat kar rahaa tha
 The HO model makes the following main assumptions: H-O siddhant ke saath samasya yah he ki yah puunjigat vastuon ke vyapaar ko shaamil nahin karata he 
H-O siddhant main, shram or puunji, prayek desh ke liye sthir padaarth hai
 In a modern economy, capital goods are traded internationally
 madhyavarti vastuon ke vyapaar se laabh kaaphi hota hai, jaisaa ki samuelson dwaara bal diya gaya tha 
 Many economists prefer the Heckscher – Olin theory than the Ricardo theory, as it makes less straightforward assumptions
 1953 main, wesile leontiff ne ek adhyayan prakashit kiya, jahaan unhone heksher-olin siddhant kii vaidhata kaa pareekshan kiya
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki anya deshon kii tulana main america puunji main adhik prachur tha, isliye america puunji-pradhan maal kaa niryaat kar rahaa tha or shram-pradhan maal kaa aayaat
 leontiff ne paaya ki aayaat kii tulana main america kaa niryaat kam puunji-pradhan tha
 After the Leontief paradox emerged, many researchers tried to save the heckscher-olin theory, either by new methods of measurement, or by new interpretations
 Leamer emphasized that Leontief did not correctly interpret the HO theory and claimed that contradiction did not occur with a correct interpretation
 brechar or choudri ne paaya ki, agar limar sahi tha, to america mazaduron kii prati vyakti khapat, mazdooron ke vishwa ausat khapat se kam honi chahie
 Later several other tests took place but most of them failed
 kai prasiddh pathyapustak lekhak, jinamein shaamil hai krugman or obstfeld or boven, holender or vien, H-O model kii vaidhata ke bare main nakaaratmak hai
 
 After testing a long history of empirical research, Bowen, Hollander, and VN concluded: "recent tests of the factor abundance theory that directly examine the HOV equations also indicate a rejection of the theory"
 : 321 heksher-olin siddhant ko dakshin-uttar vyapaar samasyaon kaa vishleshan karne ke liye acchhee tarah anukulit nahin kiya gaya he
 Estimates of HO are less realistic regarding NS than NN trade
 uttar or dakshin ke bich aay bhinnata hi ek aisi chiz he jisaki teesri duniya ko sabase zyada parvaah hoti he
 The factor price equalization has not shown much sign of recovery
 HO model maanata he ki deshon ke bich samaan utpaadan kaary karata he
 This is very unrealistic
 viksit or vikasshil deshon ke bich praudyogiki kii bhinnata, garib deshon ke liye chintaa kaa mukhya vishay he
 In this model, labor mobility between industries is possible, while capital is stable between industries in the short term
 is prakaar, is model ko heksher-olin model ke ek 'alpakaaleen' sanskaran ke rup main vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 The specific factor name refers to what is provided, in the short term, specific factors of production such as physical capital are not easily transferable between industries
 siddhant yah suzav detaa he ki agar maal kii keemat main vruddhi hoti he, to us maal ke vishisht sandarbh main utpaadan ke kaarak ke maalikon ko vaastavik rup se acha laabh hoga
 In addition, owners of specific factors of anti-production are likely to have opposing agendas when they seek favors to control labor immigration
 iske vipareet, puunji or shram, donon ke maalikon ko puunji nidhi main vruddhi se vaastavik rup main laabh hota he
 This model is ideal for particular industries
 yah model aay vitaran ko samajhane ke liye adarsh he lekin vyapaar kii paddati kii charchaa karne ke liye bhadda he
 New business theory tries to explain many facts about trade, which is difficult for the two main models outlined above
 isamen yah tathy bhi shaamil he ki zyaadaatar vyapaar, samaan kaarak bandobasti or utpaadakta str or maujuud bahurashtriya utpaadan kii badi maatra vaale deshon ke bich hota he
 In one example of this framework, the economy exhibits monopoly competition and increasing profits on a scale

 These trade agreements, coupled with unfair trade claims that are not profitable for developing countries, have often led to protests and dissatisfaction

 Regulation of international trade is done globally through the World Trade Organization and through many other regional arrangements such as MERCOSUR in South America, the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, and European between 27 independent countries Union

 pichley lekh main charchaa kii he ki kaise antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa samarthan paristhitiki pranaaliyon or vyapaar ke anukool nitiyon kii jarurat he, to ve ubharate bazaaron main safal hone ke liye kar rahe hai
 Of particular importance is the role of governments in deciding whether they will allow international businesses to setup their operations and encourage them to grow and succeed
 aksar, kai deshon kii sarkaron ke liye ek vikalp nahin he lekin antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat karne ke rup main ve "nakadi" yaa dollar kii jarurat he, kyonki ve bhi janaa jaataa he
 For example, the difference between exports and imports is known as current account deficit or CAD
 kai ubharate bazaaron ke baad se ghate dollar ke saath vitt poshan kii jarurat he ki logon kii he
 Then, governments can borrow losses at high rates or finance losses through FDI or foreign direct investment and equity flows from fiis or foreign institutional investors to the stock markets
 iske alaava, gharelu udyog kshamtaaon ko ek vishesh kshetra he or na hi visheshgyata he ki kshetra kaa vikaas karne main safal hone ke liye nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, FDI becomes necessary for the development of that region
 iske alaava, arthvyavastha ke khulne vishwa vyapaar sanghathan yaa vishwa vyapaar sanghathan, jiskaa matlab he ki aadesh main, anya deshon ko niryaat karne ke liye ubharate bazaar or vikasshil arthvyavasthaaon main kholane ke liye he ki main pravesh ke liye aavashyak he
 For this reason, many governments in developing countries are doing something to encourage and allow foreign investment in international businesses to operate the setup in their respective countries
 haalanki, ek hi sarkaron kii nitiyon ko jari rakhane yaa nahin kaarak he ki sarkaron kii vaicharik tula, raajnneeti kii majaburiyon, or tathy yah he ki videshi nivesh kii yojana banaai arthvyavastha ke rup main shuru kik main safal nahin ho saktaa he shaamil kii ek mejabaan par nirbhar karata he
 The important aspect here is that many governments in emerging economies often welcome international businesses with open arms because of the above reasons
 haalanki, bich main hi prakriya ke madhyam se, unamem se kuch nitigat pakshaaghaat kii vajah se thand pair viksit karne, or karkon se upar soochibaddh he
 It is understandable that allowing international businesses to enter emerging economies needs to be bipartisan meaning that there should be a broad consensus on the issue from all stakeholders
 tabhi to antarrashtriya kaarobaar ubhartee bazaar arthvyavasthaaon main kaamyaab hogi
 In addition, competition for foreign capital is so intense that the process in an adverse economy and therefore, the process must be continued and the reason given incentives affect international businesses

 On the other hand, India and Russia are in the other way of example these countries opened their economies due to compulsions with open arms and then but unsuccessfully around to maintain momentum

 He launched a divine campaign of intellectual Digvijay to bring Buddhism out of India
 kumaril bhat ne jo aadhaar taiyaar kiya usee par aadi shankaracharya vishaal bhawan uthaaya
 Kumaril Bhatt was an Assamese Bhat and was first a Buddhist but later converted to Hinduism through conversion
 taranath unhen dakshin bharat kaa nivasee bataate hai
 Scholars differ about their period
 kintu saamaanya rup se unka samay isa kii saatvin shatabdi main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 He preceded Shankaracharya
 ve vachaspati mishra ke bhi purvavarti hai or mandan mishra unke anuyaayi hai
 Kumaril was the Guru of Bhavabhuti
 kumaril kaa yash harsh ke antim kaal main acchhee tarah fail chukaa tha
 Kumaril wrote three famous chronicles on Shabar Bhashya
 kumaril ke darshan kaa teen mukhya bhaagon main adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he- gyanamimasaa, tatvamimasaa or acharmimasaa
 The nature of knowledge and its means has been discussed in detail by Kumaril
 gyaan ke vishay main pehla prashn he ki yatharth gyaan athwa prama kaa swaroop kya he - yani jo dikhta, suungha jaataa, chakhaa jaataa vah kaise pataa chalata he man ko
 According to Mimamsa, knowledge of a previously unknown and true object is called Prama
 is gyaan kaa kisi anya gyaan dwaara baadh athwa niraakaran nahin hota or yah gyaan nirdosh kaarnon se utpann hota he
 The means by which prama or real knowledge is obtained is called evidence
 kumaril ke mat se pramaan chah prakaar ke hai - pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan, shabd, arthapatti or anuplabdhi
 The Advaita Vedanta also accepts the appropriate six proofs
 mimasaa gyaan ko swat:pramanya maanati he
 According to Kumaril, the authenticity or truth of knowledge comes with its origin
 jis samay kisi vastu kaa gyaan hota he usee samay uski satyata kaa bhi gyaan ho jaataa he
 No other evidence is required to prove its veracity
 kintu gyaan kii asatyata athwa apramanikta kaa bodh tab hota he jab uskaa baad main vastu ke vaastavik swaroop se virodh dikhaai padataa he yaa usko utpann karanevaale kaarnon ke dosha kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Therefore, epistemology considers self-authenticity about knowledge
 mimasaa ke anusaar gyaan kaa pramanya swat: or apramanya parat: hota he
 Both Kumaril and Prabhakar formulate this view
 ve bahya vastuon ke astitv ko sweekaar karte hai
 They do not consider the world false as Advaita Vedanta or Mahayana Buddhist philosophy
 sansar satya he
 The world and matter have independent existence from the mind
 unke mat se padaarth paanch prakaar ke hai : dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya tathaa abhaav
 They divide them into two parts: emotion and absence
 pratham chaar bhav padaarth kehalaate hai
 Like the Vaishyas, they have considered four types of absence: Pragbhava, Prabhavabshava, Exuberance and Interaction
 dravya vah he jisamen gun rahete hai
 According to Kumaril it is of eleven types: earth, water, air, sky, soul, mind, goods, pain, darkness and words
 inamen pratham nau dravya vaisheshik darshan se hi liye gaye hai
 Kumaril has given recognition to the darkness and the word as well
 gunon ke vishay main bhi kumaril par vaisheshik kaa paryaapt prabhaav prathit hota he
 Like Pustapada, they also have 24 qualities
 ye hai rup, ras, gandh, sparsh, sankhya, pariman, pruthaktv, sanyog, vibhaag, paratv, apratv, gurutv, dravatv, sneh, gyaan, ichha, dwesh, praytn, sukh, dukh, sanskaar, dhwani, prakatya or shakti
 In this list of virtues, he has placed sound and place of religion and unrighteousness in place of word of pragmatism
 karm ko bhi vaisheshik kii tarah ve paanch prakaar kaa maanate hai : unkshepan, apkshepan, akunchan, prasaaran or gaman
 According to Prabhakar, karma is a matter of conjecture, but Kumaril believes that it is evident
 saamaanya ko prabhakar tathaa kumaril donon satya maanate hai
 According to him, it is interviewed with the senses
 is vishay main inkaa baudhon se purna virodh he kyonki ve saamaanya kii satta sweekaar nahin karte
 Kumaril does not believe in the origin and destruction of the world
 sansar main vastuen utpann tathaa nasht hoti rahati he
 The process of birth and death of organisms goes on and on, but the whole world has neither its origin nor its destruction
 nyaay kii tarah kumaril ishwar ko jagat kaa kaaran nahin maanate
 Through numerous arguments, he has tried to prove that it is not rational to consider God as the cause of the world
 kumaril ke anusaar aatma ek nity dravya he
 It is different or wider
 vah karta tathaa karm-fal-bhokta donon hi he
 The soul is different from body, sense, mind and intellect
 vah vigyaanon kii santan maatr nahin he
 Kumaril has disproved Buddhist dogma and the theory of scientific science by many strong arguments
 unke anusaar nity aatma ke astvi kii anubhuti tathaa samaran aadi kriyaaon kii vyakhya nahin kii ja sakati
 The soul is consequential and continual
 aatma anshat: jad tathaa anshat: chetan he
 With Chidansh, the soul acquires knowledge of things: through achids, it is the possessive quality in the form of knowledge, pleasure, sorrow, desire, effort, etc
 which arises when a particular situation, such as coincidence with the subject of the senses
 sushupti tathaa moksh kii avasthaa main aatma main chetana nahin rahati
 In Kumaril's view, the soul is both a knower and a subject of knowledge
 veda ke vaakya ki mai aatma athwa brahm hoon, aatma ko jaano is mat kii pushti karte hai
 The main purpose of Mimamsa philosophy is to represent religion
 jaimini ke anusaar dharm kaa lakshan he chetana arthath kriya kaa pravarttak vachan athwa veda kaa vidhivaakya
 According to the Mimansakas, the main meaning of Veda is the rendering of functional or rituals
 veda main pratipaadit karm teen prakaar ke hai : kamya, pratishiddh tathaa nity naimitthik
 According to Kumaril: *kamya karm - kisi kaamana kii siddhi ke liye kiye jate hai, jaise swarg kii ichha karne vaala vyakti yajna kare
 Prohibited deeds - which have been considered prohibited in the Vedas
 *nity karm - jinka pratidin karnaa aavashyak mana gaya he, jaise sandhyavandan aadi 
 Naimittik deeds are performed on special occasions, such as Shraddha
 manushya ko apane kiye achche bure karmo kaa fal avashya praapt hota he
 How do yajnadi deeds performed in the present result in future or in future? To explain this, Mimansak imagines Apoorva
 kumaril ke anusaar apurv ek adrishy shakti he jo kisi kaary ko karne se utpann hoti he
 It is due to Apoorva that the soul gets the fruits according to its deeds
 isse karm or fal ke bich apurv ek adrishy kadi he
 According to Kumaril, the study and contemplation of Vedanta helps in attaining salvation
 moksh kii avasthaa aatma kaa sharir, indriya, buddhi tathaa sansar kii in vastuon se sambandh sadaa ke liye samaapt ho jaataa he
 The soul is completely free from sorrow
 us avasthaa main sukh kii bhi koi anubhuti nahin rahati
 It is a state of complete freedom and peace
 moksh praapt karne ke liye manushya ko kamya or nishiddh karmon kaa tyaag karnaa chahie
 But it is necessary to keep on editing the routine karmitik karma
 vedavihit karmon kaa anushthan moksh kaa sadhak he
