 inhone rugveda kii anek kavitaaon kaa saras hindi kavyanuwaad bhi kiya tha
 Kalanath Shastri has written on his work- {citation} - "in March 2003, the Indian Council of Philosophical Research in Delhi held a huge scholarly seminar to congratulate him on completing 80 years, in which philosophers, historians, Sanskrit-mystics around the world , Writer, poet etc
 were present
 unke sarjanaatmak or vimarshatmak vaidushya ke ayaamon par teen din tak charchaa hui thi
 The research articles read in that seminar also appeared in the booklet
 hindi main bhi ek granth us sangoshtee ke nishkarshon ko shaamil kar nikaala gaya, jiskaa sheershak tha ‘avyay : acharya govind chandra pande kaa sarjanaatmak avdaan’ 2005:, kintu usamen bhi un ke krititv kaa puraa chitra nahin tha, kyonki uskaa falak bahut vyapak he
 He wrote more than fifty books on ten fifteen subjects in ancient history, Buddhist culture, Vedic poetry, value epics, history philosophy, Indian philosophy, Shankaracharya, comparative religion, comparative aesthetics etc
, were in English, Hindi and Sanskrit trio
 anuwaad alag the
 " "darshan, itihaas or sanskrit ke gahan gyaan ne inase jo granth likhwaaye, unamem gunta, praudhata or sankshep main baat kehane kii pravanta hona swaabhaavik tha
 In his texts printed from the Rajasthan Hindi Granth Academy, 'price Mimamsa' reflects all these characteristics
 " "his treatises on Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist India are considered excellent
 jyotish par bhi unka adhikaar tha
 In later days, his book 'vedic Culture' written to present all-round discourse of Vedic literature is also a peak level text
 yah granth jab likhaa ja rahaa tha, main inke nikat sampark main tha, kyonki inkaa yah shauk suprasiddh tha ki elahabaad main rahete hue apane janmdin par elahabaad museum main desh ke shikharstha manishiyon kii kisi na kisi vishay par ek rashtriya sangoshtee avashya hi yojit hoti thi
 He used to call half-baked people like me
 maine is granth kaa sheershak sujhaayaa tha ‘vaidic vaanmay’, par unhone ‘vaidic samskruti’ naam kyon rakhaa, iskaa auchity unhone yah bataaya ki is main upanishad vaanmay kaa bhi puraa vimarsh he
 This title can only contain both
 inhone vahiin bataaya tha ki netaji subhash chandra bose ke mitra kshetresh babu se ye sanskrit padhe the or unke saamne bhi unki kakshaayen, unke aadesh par ye sanskrit madhyam main hi padhaate the
 From this you can guess to what extent they had authority over Sanskrit
 aaj shaayad desh main chaar-paanch vidvan hi us kad-lathi ke bache hon
 " "prasiddh angreji kaviyon kii kavitaaon kaa sanskrit main anuwaad ‘astachalium’ or praakrit gaatha saptshati kaa hindi ke dohon main anuwaad ‘mahilaayein’ sheershak se unhone nikaala
 " "tulanaatmak dharm par sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay kaashi main die inke sanskrit smarak bhaashan kaa grathakar prakaashan hua he ‘ek sad wipra bahudhaa vadanti’ sheershak se
 In this, the discussion of religion that he has covered, from the concept of religion in the history of human beings, to the interpretation of religions that make religion a sect
 koi sanskrit-pandit bhi aisa granth likh paae, yah kam hi sambhav he
 More wonderful than this is their comparative aesthetics, titled 'aesthetic Dissertation:'
 isamen unani saundaryashastra se lekar bom garton kii german kala paribhaashaon se hote hue sanskrit kavyashastra ko lapet kar francisi kroche or astitvvaad tak ye apane vimarsh ko le aae hai
 It is difficult to write all this in Sanskrit, although Sanskrit is the only language in the world in which words can be formed for concepts around the world
 aise shabd banaate-banaate inhone, germany ke ek saundaryashastri bom garton kaa naam bhi sanskrit main utaar daalaa ‘vrikshodyan’! !!" {uddhran-ant} 1

 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice that proclaims that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages such as 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow them, allowing each person to attain the Hayat and finally the success

 In Medina, Hazrat Muhammad had improved relations between the various existing communities
 The constitution of Madina specifying community relations was rewritten from Hazrat Muhammad's Salah, which led to the formation of an independent community, and the first Islamic state
 Was established In 630 AD, Muhammad Sah with his followers marched on Mecca, the people of Mecca were defeated in the war and Mecca came under the control of the Muslims
 Kaaba Sharif was declared a holy place of Islam
 In later years, Muhammad underwent several social and religious reforms, uniting the various Arab tribes under Islam
 Hazrat died in 632 AD, but by then almost all tribes of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam

 In the Quran, Muhammad is also referred to as "ahmad"
 The law of universal brotherhood and the principle of human equality, which you proclaim, is a reflection of the great contribution that Hazrat Muhammad made to the social upliftment of humanity

 In childhood, he was called by two names, his mother used to call him Muhammad and grandfather Abdul Muttalib called him Ahmed
 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance
 One of them is the following: "ootiyat ummuhu fil manaami faki-l laha annaki ha-m-lat sayyidal aalami-na va kheral variyati fa-sammihu mohammadan ija va-ja-atahu satu hmdu biha0" Muhammad was orphaned at a young age
 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness
 , And was buried at darun-nabiya

 | In Bani Saad, Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam spent the first five years of his life with his foster-mother Halima Saadia

 Triangular survey is the name of the method in which the survey is easily done by dividing the given area for the survey as a mesh of triangular pieces
 iskaa siddhanth bahut saral he - gyaat duuri par sthit kinhin bhi do binduon se kisi tisare bindu dwaara banaaye gayi konon ko maapkar trikonmittiya sarvasamikaon kii sahaayta se us tisare bindu kii sahi sthiti nirdhaarit kii ja sakati he
 Its specialty is that it has to measure distance at a minimum and measurement of angles works
 konon kaa maapan adhik shuddhta se, kam samay me, kam shram se ho jaataa he
 Generally, where it is not possible to measure the direct distance between two distant points, but they are visible between themselves, a triangular survey is very useful
 yadi aise tribhuj kii ek, do yaa teenon bhujaaon par krmanugat tribhuj banaate chale jaaen or praarambhik tribhuj kii ek bhujaa, uske donon sheersh binduon ke niamak or banaae gaye sabhi tribhujon ke kone gyaat hon, to aisi sampurna tribhujamala kii bhujaaon kii lambaaiyaan or tribhuj banaanevaale binduon ke niamak or banaae gaye sabhi tribhujon ke kone gyaat hon, to aisi sampurna tribhujamala kii bhujaaon kii lambaaiyaan or tribhuj banaanevaale binduon ke niamak ganitiya kalan se gyaat kiye ja sakate hai
 In order to map any area, it is necessary to establish such points scattered evenly over the entire region
 aise binduon ko samuhik rup main surveykshan hetu 'niyantran dhaanchaa' or prayek bindu ko alag alag 'surveykshan stesan' kehete hai
 In the triangular survey, the help of trigonometric identities is used in the calculation, which has the following principal - trikoniya surveykshan ke uparyukt aadharbhat siddhantein ke anukool karyprakriya pradhanat: chaar bhaagon main bant jaati he : Selection of stations to make such a triangle, so that evenly scattered control points are available in the entire area for survey, ek aisi bhujaa praapt karnaa jisaki lambaai gyaat ho tathaa jis par praarambhik tribhuj banaaya jaay or uski bhujaaon par krmanugat tribhujon kii jaali buni ja se, Measure the horizontal and vertical angles on the triangles formed on the triangles drawn and binduon ke niamakon kaa kalan
 The first task is to select and mark the stations
 stesan bindu aise chune jate hai jo aath se assi kilametre tak ek duusare se dur hon ore sughatit tribhujamala banaaen
 There are three types of triangles in general
 ek bindu par milanevaale tribhuj, yaa tribhujon ke duusare siron par bane stesan, paraspar drushtigochar hon or aise sthal par bane hon jisase prayek tribhuj ke sheershabindu par konenaapane kaa yantra, theodolite, rakhkar kone padhe ja saken
 Angles are read from the same point and the same point, for the convenience, mark each station by digging a point on a stone
 bindu kii sthiti thik or sahi pahchaanane ke liye uske chaaron ore ek vrut bana diya jaataa he
 If such a stable stone is not naturally available at that site, then the stone is brought apart so that the surface of the circle and point is seen outside the surface of the earth, so that after any period the survey goes to that place
 Be able to identify the station
 bahudhaa suraksha kii drushti se surveykshak do pattharon par vrutt or centrebindu banaata he
 One is buried about one meter deep inside the earth and the other is placed on the surface of the earth such that the center of focus between the two circles fall on the same vertical line
 dur se dekhne kii suvidha ke liye steshnon ke aas paas kuch sanketachihn laga die jate hai
 In the area where the survey is to be done, if two points are available which are mutually visible and their regulators are known, then a third appropriate point can be selected and initial triangle can be drawn on it
 kisi bhi tribhujamala main aarambh karne ke liye ek bhujaa gyaat hona aavashyak he
 Such an arm is called a baseline
 aadhaar-rekha ke sire ke binduon ke niamak gyaat hon, to gananaa dwaara uski lambaai nikaali ja sakati he
 For example, if the regulatory points of those points are on the north-south line, line, respectively, and the east-west line, arm, then the length of the arm will be: us bhujaa kaa uttar disha se dakshinvarti kone This angle is required in calculating the regulators
 ise dinman kehete hai
 If two such points are not available, then the base is measured and established at the same time
 iske liye surveykshak aarambh karne vaale bindu ke aasapaas ek suvidhajanak samtal bhukhand par, yatharth maap denevaale feete se, ek rekha a aa naapta he
 These days, mainly, these feet hang the lace in the rope
 feete ke siron ke bich yatharth kshaitij duuri gananaa dwaara nikaal lee jaati he
 On it respectively, such triangles are formed that no angle of any triangle except the first one or two triangles is less than 20 degrees
 aadhaar bhujaa se aarambh karte samay do kone i or i 3 degree tak ke le liye jate hai
 But they are measured very accurately by frequency method
 yah kone theodolite naamak yantra se napate hai
 Starting at the base points, the angles are read by centering theodolite at all station points, respectively
 jaise jaise tribhujamala ke ek ek tribhuj yaa chaturbhuj ke saare kone puure ho jate hai, surveykshak jyamitiya sambandhon, jaise tribhuj ke teenon kone yaa chaturbhuj ke chaaron kone, kii jaanch karata jaataa he
 Due to the spherical surface of the Earth, when the triangle is very large, the sum of its angles exceeds 180 degrees
 is prakaar kii badhati ko goleey aadhiky kehete hai
 In a triangle of 75 square miles, this excess is 1 ""
 prekshan trutiyon or goleey aadhiky kaa shodhan karke gananaa main kone prayukt hote hai
 At the end of the observation, the lengths of all the sides are determined by the trigonometric formula using the base arm and the measured angles of the initial triangle
 taduparant niamak nikaalane ke liye gyaat bindu yaa binduon se agyaat bindu ko jodne vaali rekha yaa rekhaon ke dinman, jiskaa ullekh pehle ho chukaa he, nikaal liye jate hai
 The distance of the unknown point from the known point or points can be made known to the regulator and its pointer sine by knowing the value of the point
 ye ytaakar niamak kehalaate hai
 If the vertical angles also fall with the horizontal observation, then the height of the unknown point will not be high
 uparyukt samikarnon main u, pus or uu gyaat bindu kii kramash: uttarayan tathaa purvayan unchaaiyaan hai or da evam na kramash: agyaat bind kii duuri or natikon hai
 Geographical regulators of points, namely latitude and longitude, can also be derived by considering the Earth as a spheroid
 yadi trikoniya surveykshan aarambh karne ke liye keval ek bindu gyaat ho to duusare chune gaye stesan kii gyaat stesan kii gyaat stesan se duuri feete se aadharekha naapakar, prasaarit aadhaar jaal dwaara nikaalte hai
 Dinman is known from the astronomical observations of Dhruvatara and Surya etc
 yadi kisi kshetra main surveykshan pehali baar aarambh ho rahaa ho, jahaan kaai bhi bindu gyaat na ho to kuch din tak nirant khagoleey prekshan karke ek bindu ke niamak nirdhaarit karte hai
 Looking at the clear sky day by day during the night, it will be known that many recognizable bright stars are seen uniformly floating on the surface of a sphere
 unke udai or ast bhi niyamit rup se hote dekhe jaayenge
 Such spheres can also be imagined to be divided by the earth's post-meridian and parallels, which follow mathematical formulas
 in tathyon kaa laabh uthaakar surveykshak taron kaa prekshan karke prekshan stesan ke niamak nikaalane main safal ho jaataa he
 a triangular survey can be done from that and the measured outline
 lokaneeti athwa 'saarvajanik niti' vah niti he jiske anusaar rajya ke prashasnic karypalak apana kaary karte hai
 Many thinkers are of the opinion that public administration is the sum of the activities implemented to implement and fulfill public policy
 sawarjanik niti kaa adhyayan america ke kai vishvavidhyalayon main pramukhataa se kiya jaataa he
 Public policy is generally classified into general headings such as economy, environment, education, technical and social policies

 Public policies deal with multiple parties from the micro level to the macro level
 iskaa sambandh chaahe aantarik gharelu pakshon se ho yaa bahya videshi maamle se
 In the domestic sphere, public policies may focus on a particular village at the micro level or may be related to a specific segment or community

 Drinks of water, dispose of its garbage and waste through public sanitation system, public utilities Reads books from the library, celebrates picnics in public parks and benefits from the public police, fire and health system
 antatogatva, uski mrityu chikitsaalay main hoti he, or ho saktaa he ki usko saarvajanik shamshaan main dafnaaya jaye

 lok prashasan kaa raajnneeti vigyaan ke samaanaantar adhyayan ke ek kshetra ke rup main pradurbhaav hone tathaa ek alag shaikshanik vibhaag ke rup main ubharne ke saath hi, 1960 ke dashak main saarvajanik niti ko raajnneeti vigyaan ke antargat adhyayan ke ek upakshetra ke naate manyata mili
 'public policy' is a theoretical study of the government's attitude towards public affairs
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa bal siddhanth par, tathaa sajrvanik niti kaa bal uske anuprayog par hota he
 As a result of the behavioral revolution in political science, 'relevance' has become a central topic of study for most political scientists
 raajnneeti shastriyon ne, visheshkar sanyukt rajya america main, chathe dashak ke uttararddh main mahasoos kiya ki samaaj ke saamne upasthiti kai sankatkalin samasyaon kaa hal nikaalane kii atyadhik aavashyaktaa he
 For example, the US involvement in Vietnam was a scary experience for the American public
 vishwa bhar main hathiyaaron kii daud ne vishwa ke astitv tak ko bade khatre main daal diya
 Ethnic problems have become a major challenge for many societies
 sanyukt rajya america or rus jaisi mahashaktiyon dwaara liye gaye nirnyon kii parinti yuddh yaa shanti, aarthik unnati yaa ant, parmaanu vidhwans yaa shantipurna sah astitv main ho sakati he
 Political scientists have realized the potential dangers and positive benefits of public policy and have come to the conclusion that the study and analysis of public policies is highly needed
 sarkarein in uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye kai nitiyaan bana sakati he or kosh uplabdh kara sakati hai
 Even then, mere enactment of legislation and passing of budget will not prove that the desired objectives will be achieved
 bhartiya yojanaon main hameshaa hi uddeshyon or uplabdhiyon ke madhya ek bada interval rahata he
 The reasons for those failures have to be analyzed
 saral rup main vyakt karnaa ho to, sawarjanik niti sarkaron kii gatividhiyon kaa yoga he, chaahe sarkaar swayan kaary karti he yaa abhikarta ke madhyam se kaary karti he
 Public policy has an impact on the lives of citizens
 sarakaren jo kuch bhi karnaa yaa nahin karnaa pasand karti hai vahiin sawarjanik niti he
 Political scientist David Easton has defined public policy as the "maximization of large sums of money for the whole society"
 raajnneeti vaigyanik henj eula evam kenith previt saarvajanik niti kii ek anya paribhaasha dete hai
 According to him the policy can be defined as 'permanent construction'
 saarvajanik niti kaa vishleshan praayah nitigat nirnay yaa niti kathan ke parinaamon ke prakaash main kiya jaataa he
 The policy outcome is a true expression of public policy
 saral shabdon main, nitigat parinaam sarkaar dwaara jo kuch vastav main kiya jaataa he, usko pradarshit karte hai
 Public policies are an overall depiction of a political system
 sawarjanik niti kaa parichaalit kshetra atishay vistrut hota he tathaa isi ke pahunch or vyapti paryaapt vrahat hoti he
 Look at any aspect of human life, we cannot get rid of any one or the other policy
 bachche ke janm se lekar manushya kii mrityu tak or jab bhi jab mritak sharir antim sanskaron ke liye shamshaan grih laayaa jaataa he, koi na koi niti hoti he jiskaa saamana hamen karnaa padataa he or jiskaa laabh ham uthaate hai
 Child education, prevention of diseases, better and nutritious food, good clothes, best higher education, job prospects, better salary, adequate housing, home and other facilities, protection from national and international hazards and prevention of natural disasters are some of the policies whose We discuss it easily
 anya rashtiy shaktiyon par anyonyashray ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, kisi raajnneetik pranali kii saarvajanik nitiyaan aayaat-niryaat se sambandhit tathaa anya raashton se achche evam maitreepurn sambandhon se sambandhit nitiyon ko bhi apane main sammilit karti he
 It is difficult to define or define the scope and reach of public policy in words
 saarvajanik niti apni gatividhiyon ke bade hisse main unako shaamil karti he jo vikaas niti se susangat hoti hai
 Major principles such as socio-economic development, equality, freedom or self-determination or guidance of activities can be accepted as development policy or national goal
 saarvajanik niti sankeern ho sakati he, jab isamen kisi ek vishisht gatividhi jaise parivaar-niyojan ko sammilit kiya jaataa he
 Public policy can be applied to all the people of the country or to a limited class of people
 saarvajanik niti sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak rup main ho sakati he
 In a positive way it can be in the form of direct governmental action to solve a specific problem
 duusari taraf, yah apane nakaaratmak rup main sarkari karmchaaree dwaara, us vishay par jiske bare main koi shaskeey aadesh apekshit tha, koi kaarywahi nahin karnaa sammilit karti he
 Public policy, thus, has a statutory oppressive quality that citizens consider to be legally justified
 udaahranarth, karon kaa bhugtan avashya kiya janaa chahie anyathaa jail yatra yaa jurmaane kaa khatra uthaane ko taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 This legal form of public policy makes oppressive public organizations different from private organizations
 loktantric vyavastha main sarkaar sampoorn samaaj ke pratibimb ke sivaay kuch bhi nahin he
 The government has many areas of administration, such as education, defense, finance etc
 prayek kshetra ke liye yaa kisi vishisht kshetra ke liye sarkaar nitiyon kaa nirupan karti he jinhen saamanyatya saarvajanik nitiyon se janaa jaataa he
 If the policy is long term then the objective will also be determined accordingly
 udhaaharan ke liye, pratiraksha sambandhi niti main dderghaavadhi uddeshy dhyaan main rakhe jaavenge
 These long term objectives can be of excellent recruitment, proper training, proper arrangement etc
 isi tarah shiksha, swasthya, vitt evam parivaar kalyaan aadi se sambandhit nitiyon ke uddeshyon kaa nirdhaaran bhi dderghaavadhi aadhaar par kiya jaavega
 Some problems arise by chance
 is tarah ke maamalon main nitiyon kaa nirupan laghu avadhi ke uddeshyon ke saath kiya jaataa he
 For example, blackouts are ordered during wartime and people are removed from nearby villages in border areas
 isi tarah, yadi kahin hinsa bhadak uthati he to police, laghuvadhi ke uddeshyon ke aadhaar par vahaan vidhi evam nyaay vyavastha kii punarsthapana karti he
 For a holistic understanding of public policy, a combination of public policy scenarios and environmental forces must be analyzed
 saarvajanik niti ke vibhinn ayaamon ko samajhane kii ghor aavashkata he
 Indeed in the modern world, public policies determine the destiny of mankind
 maanav maatr kaa kalyaan tathaa aarthik uddhaar, saarvajanik niti kii nipunata par nirbhar he
 If unskilled policies were continued year after year, those policies would contribute to the deterioration of the economic standard of the people

 Saturn becomes the object of witchcraft, when Saturn gives its momentum in the first house, the first house is the only one, when the darkness starts hiding, the light is recognized and when the position is hidden then the shadow of Saturn Only darkness can be considered
 andhere ke kai rup hote hai, ek andheraa vah hota he jiske kaaran kuch bhi dikhaai nahi detaa he, yah ankhon kaa andheraa mana jaataa he, ek andheraa samajhane kaa bhi hota he, saamne kuch hota he, or samajha kuch jaataa he, ek andheraa buraaiyon kaa hota he, vyakti yaa jeev kii sabhi achchhaaiyaan buraaiyon ke andar chupane kaa kaaran bhi shani kaa diya gaya andheraa hi mana jaataa he, naam kaa andheraa bhe hota he, kisi ko pataa hi nahi hota he, ki koun he or kahaan se aayaa he, koun maan he or koun baap he, aadi ke dwaara kisi bhi rup me chhupav bhi shani ke kaaran hi mana jaataa he, vyakti chaalaaki kaa putala ban jaataa he pratham bhav ke shani ke dwaara
shani apane sthaan se pratham bhav ke andar sthiti rakh kar tisare bhav ko dekhtaa he, teesraa bhav apane se chote bhai bahino kaa bhi hota he, apni andaruni takat kaa bhi hota he, parakram kaa bhi hota he, jo kuch bhi ham dusron se kehete he, kisi bhi saadhan se, kisi bhi tarah se shani ke kaaran apni baat ko sampreshit karne me kathinaayee aati he, jo kaha jaataa he vah saamne vaale ko yaa to samaj me nahi aata he, or aata bhi he to ek bhayanak andheraa hone ke kaaran vah kahi gayi baat ko na samajhane ke kaaran kuch kaa kuch samaj letaa he, parinaam ke andar fal bhi jo chaiye vah nahi miltaa he, aksar dekha jaataa he ki jiske pratham bhav me shani hota he, uskaa jivan saathi jor jor se bolnaa chaalu kar detaa he, uskaa kaaran uske dwaara jor jor se bolne kii aadat nahi, pratham bhav kaa shani sunne ke andar kami kar detaa he, or saamne vaale ko jor se bolne par hi yaa to sunaayi detaa he, yaa vah kuch kaa kuch samaj letaa he, isi liye jivan saathi ke saath kuch sunne or kuch samajhane ke kaaran maansik naa samajhi kaa parinaam sambandhon me kaduvaahat ghul jaati he, or sambandh tut jate hai
 From its first house, the tenth eye directly looks at the spirit of karma, this is also the spirit of karma
 jataka ko karm karne or karm ko samajhane me kaafii kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa pasta he, jab kisi prakaar se karm ko nahi samajha jaataa he to jo bhi kiya jaataa he vah karm na hokar ek bhaar swaroop hi samajha jaataa he, yahi baat pita ke prati maan lee jaati he,pita ke prati shani apni sift ke anusaar andhera detaa he, or us andhere ke kaaran pita ne putr ke prati kya kiya he, samaj nahi hone ke kaaran pita putr main anban bhi bani rahati he,putr kaa lagan yaa pratham bhav kaa shani mata ke chauthe bhav me chalaa jaataa he, or mata ko jo kaam nahi karne chaiye ve usko karne passage hai, kathin or ek seemaa me rahakar mata ke dwaara kaam karne ke kaaran uskaa jivan ek ghere main bandhaa sa rah jaataa he, or vah apni shariri sift ko us prakaar se prayog nahi kar paati he jis prakaar se ek saadhaaran aadmi apni jindagi ko jeena chahta he
 The second house is the sense of material wealth, by physical wealth means, rupee, money, gold, silver, diamond, pearl, jewelry, etc

 Second Saturn also sees the eleventh house, the eleventh house darkens its faith towards immovable property, darkens the mind towards friends and elder brothers and sisters
 ve kuch karnaa chaahate hai lekin vyakti ke dimag main kuch or hi samaj me aata he
 The third sense is of might, of the courage and courage of the person, wherever the person lives, of his neighbors
 in sabake kaarnon ke andar tisare bhav se shani pancham bhav ko bhi dekhtaa he, jiname shiksha,santan or turat aane vaale dhano ko bhi janaa jaataa he, mitron kii sahabhaagita or bhabhi kaa bhav bhi paanchavaa bhav mana jaataa he, pita kii mrityu kaa or dada ke bade bhai kaa bhav bhi paanchavaa he

 According to astrology, there are three kinds of beliefs of Saturn's Saadhesati, firstly, secondly by Chandra Lagan or Zodiac and third by Sun Lagna, in North India, the calculation of Saturn's half-sati by Chandra Lagana has been in practice since ancient times

 During Sadesati, Saturn takes account of the deeds done by the native in the same way as the owner asks for the account after some time after giving full responsibility to the servant of a house, and in the case of mistake or mistake Punishment is given to the servant, similarly Shani Dev also punishes every creature
 or yahi nahi jin logon ne achche karm kiye hote hai to unako sadheshaati puraskaar bhi pradaan karti he, jaise nagar yaa gram kaa yaa shahar kaa mukhiya bana diya janaa aadi
shani kii sadhesati ke aakhyaan anek logon ke praapt hote hai, jaise raja vikramaditya, raja nal, raja harishchandr, shani kii sadhesati sant mahatmaon ko bhi pratadit karti he, jo jog ke saath bhoga ko apnaane lagate hai
 Every person must have a Sadesati once in thirty years, if this half-and-half is in Sagittarius, Pisces, Capricorn, Aquarius, it is less painful, if it will be in the fourth, sixth, eighth, and twelfth house, So the person will be unhappy, and all the happiness will be physical, mental, and economic
 They should never forget the "sapphire" in these Sadesati, if done, there is a possibility of loss of profit
 koi nayaa kaam, nayaa udyog, bhul kar bhi sadhesati main nahi karnaa chaiye, kisi bhi kaam ko karne se pehle kisi jaankaar jyotishi se jaankaree avashya kar leni chaiye
yahaan tak ki vaahan ko bhi bhuulakar is samay main nahi khareednaa chaiye, anyathaa vah vaahan sukh kaa vaahan na hokar dukhon kaa vaahan ho jaayegaa
hamane apane pichley pachchis saal ke anubhav me dekha he ki sadhesati main kitne hi udyogpatiyon kaa bura haal ho gaya, or jo crorespati the, ve rodpati hokar ek gamche main ghoomane lage
is prakaar se yah bhi naubhav kiya ki shani jab bhi chaar, chha:, aath, baarah me vicharan karegaa, to uskaa mul dhan to nasht hoga hi, kitna hi jatan kyon na kiya jaye
or shani ke is samay kaa vichaar pehle se kar liya gaya he to dhan kii raksha ho jaati he
 If caution is not taken then only remorse remains
 at: prayek manushya ko is samay kaa shani armbh hone ke pehle hi jap tap or jo vidhaan ham aage baataayenge unako kar lenaa chaiye

shani dev ne pita kii aagyaanusaar vaisaa hi kiya, or tap karne ke baad bhagwaan shankar ke vartmaan main bhi sthit shivlinga kii sthapana kii, jo aaj bhi kaashi-vishwanath ke naam se janaa jaataa he, or karm ke kaarak shani ne apane manovanchit falon kii prapti bhagwaan shankar se kii, or grahon main sarvopari pad praapt kiya

 jo mukhya rup se dakshin asia ke uttar-pashchimi kshetron main, jo aaj tak uttar purv afghanistan ,pakistan ke uttar-pashchim or uttar bharat main faili he
 Along with the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of the three earliest chronologies of the civilizations of the ancient world, and of these three, the most widespread and most discussed
 sammanit patrika nechar main prakashit shodh ke anusaar yah sabhyataa kam se kam 8000 varsh puraani he
 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times
 7ve shatabdi main pehali baar jab logo ne punjab praant main ito ke liye mitti kii khudaai kii tab unhen vahaan se bani banaai ite mili jise logo ne bhagwaan kaa chamatkaar mana or unka upyog ghar banane main kiya uske baad1826 main charles mysen ne pehali baar is puraani sabhyataa ko khoja
 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization
 1856 main karachi se lahore ke madhya railway line ke nirmaan ke dauraan bartan bandhuon dwaara hadappa sthal kii soochna sarkaar ko di
 In this sequence, in 1861, under the direction of Alexander Cunningham, the Archaeological Department of India was established
 1904 main lard karjan dwaara jon marshall ko bhartiya puratathvik vibhaag kaa mahanideshak banaaya gaya
 Fleet wrote an article about this old civilization
 1921 main dayaram saahani ne hadappa kaa utkhanan kiya
 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization
 pratham baar kaansya ke prayog ke kaaran ise kaansya sabhyataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 1400 centers of Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered, of which 925 centers are in India
 80 pratishat sthal saraswati nadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke aas-paas he
 So far only 3 percent of the total discoveries have been excavated
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world
 is paripakv sabhyataa ke kendra-sthal punjab tathaa sindh main tha
 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction
 is prakaar hadappa samskruti ke antargat punjab, sindh or baluchistan ke bhaag hi nahin, balki gujarat, rajasthan, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke seemaant bhaag bhi the
 Its spread ranged from Rahmandheri in the north to Daimabad in the south and Sutkagandor of Makran beach in Balochistan in the west to Meerut and Kurukshetra in the northeast
 praarambhik vistaar jo praapt tha usamen sampoorn kshetra tribhujaakar tha is tarah yah kshetra aadhunik pakistan se to bada he hi, pracheen misr or mesopotamia se bhi bada he
 In the third and second millennium BC, the area of any civilization throughout the world was not larger than the Harappan culture
 ab tak bhartiya upmahadweep main is samskruti ke kul 1000sthalon kaa pataa chal chukaa he
 Some of these are in the initial stage, some are in the mature stage and some are in the later stage

 Only half a dozen of these can be called city

 Both places are in present-day Pakistan

 The third city was Mohen, which was 130 km south of Daro, at the site of Chanhudaro and the fourth city at a place called Lothal above the Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat

 The specialty of these two is to be a city fortress

 Charles Mann first came to know of this civilization in 1826
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke pramukh shahar teen deshon main is prakaar he:- The various cities of India have the following cities of the Indus Valley Civilization: - is sabhyataa kii sabase vishesh baat thi yahaan kii viksit nagar nirmaan yojana
 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep

 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks

 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storeroom
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat

 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves

 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces

 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship

 Some historians believe that the seeds of civil war were contained in the American freedom struggle itself, while some consider civil war as capitalist movement and some historians have attributed slavery to civil war
 america grihayuddh ke nimnlikhit kaaran the- The situation in the northern states of the United States was relatively strong demographically and economically
 sangh ke 34 rajyon main se 23 rajya uttar main sammilit the or desh kii kul jansankhya kaa 2 / 3 bhaag uttar main rahata tha, jisamen daason kii sankhya bahut kam thi
 Industry was predominant in the northern states
 udyogon main sooti, oonee vastra, chamade ke saamaan aadi vasteen bade paimaane par utpaadit hoti thi
 In these factories, labor was produced by machines, so slaves and slaves did not have much importance here
 duusari taraf america ke dakshini rajyon kaa aarthik jivan krishi par aadhaarit tha or krishi main yantron kaa bahut adhika prayog nahin hota tha
 Hence the peasants of these states depended on the labor of slaves for farming
 dakshin main kapaas, ganna evam tambaaku kii kheti bahut bade paimaane par hoti thi jisamen das majdoor ke rup main kaary karte the
 Therefore, the society of the south was completely dependent on slaves

 State industries in North America were predominant, so budding entrepreneurs there sought protection to avoid foreign competition
 unke hiton ko dhyaan main rakh america sangh dwaara udyogon ko sangrakshan diya gaya
 But this step was objected to by the southern states
 kyonki sangrakshan kii niti ke kaaran ab unhen vinirmit vasteen apekshaakrit mahange mulya par milti thi
 Therefore, they felt that the Union was being used for the interests of North America and a view of neglect towards the southern states
 america ke uttari rajyon main daason kii aarthik jivan main koi nirnaayak jivan main koi nirnaayak bhoomika nahin thi
 Therefore, the importance of slaves was secondary to them
 On the other hand, slavery in the southern states of America had dissolved in life
 dakshini rajyon ke maamlen main das pratha kaa mudda sadaiv samvedansheel bana rahaa
 Whenever other states arose to implement the ban on slavery in these southern states, these states considered it an attack on their sovereignty

 This anti-slave sentiment was raised in the medium of newspapers

 He argued that there was no fear of labor organizations, strikes etc
 in the slavery system and that they provide more facilities to slaves than workers of northern states

 Slave trade was abolished in North America and slavery ceased in the north to the southern border of Pennsylvania

 Now America was expanding into the western regions and new territories were being included in the United States
 aise main yah prashn uth khadaa hua ki in rajyon ko das rajya ke rup main yaa swatantra rajya ke rup main shaamil kiya jaae
 This issue was also important because in the constitution it was accepted that slaves were also counted in the federal administration, but the population of slaves was represented at an average of 3 / 5 ie if the population of slaves would be 500 then consider it 300 Representation began to be given
 is tarah das rajyon kii sankhya main vruddhi ho jane se vyavasthapika main das rajyon kaa varchasv bad jane kaa khatra tha
 Therefore, in the context of the merger of the new states, North America wanted to include it as a free state, while the southern states as a slave state
 yah vivaad mizori rajya ke vilay ko lekar or bhi gaharaa gaya
 So in 1820, the Missouri-settlement was concluded with the arbitration of Henry Clay

 This was followed by a proposal to merge Texas into the Union

 Then the issue of California was disputed and California was finally annexed as an independent state in 1850

 Now to satisfy them, a "fugitive slave" law was brought under which the runaway slave could be caught again

 In this way, the question of the merger of states widened the gap between the northern and southern states

 By February 1861, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Lulciana, and Texas also disbanded the Union and appointed Jefferson Davis as their President, and the Civil War began, with the bombing of Sumter's Fort from South Carolina as the Union
 Waged war against dakshini rajyon dwaara sangh se alag ho jane ke kaaran ek mahatvapurn sanvaidhanik prashn khadaa ho gaya ki kya dakshini raj ko sangh se alag hone kaa adhikaar he? linkan ne raashtrapati pad par nirvachan ke pashchaat spasht rup se ghoshnaa kii ki sanyukt rajya america ke rup main jo sangh sthapit kiya gaya tha vah akhandaneey or shaashwat he, uski akhandaneeyata ko kisi prakaar nasht nahin hone diya jayega
 The framers of the US Constitution have not given any state the right to secede from the Union
 linkan ne ghoshit kiya ki "agar ham sabhi daason ko mukt kar sangh ko bachaa sake to ham aisa karenge agar ham daason ko mukt kiye bina sangh ko bachaa sake to ham aisa karenge or agar kuch daason ko mukt kar tathaa kuch anya ko mukt nahin karke sangh ko bachaa sake to ham vah bhi karenge

 In 1861, Lincoln abolished the slave system and invited him to join the national armies
 kintu iskaa uddeshy dakshini rajyon ko nasht karnaa nahin varan sangh ko banaae rakhana hi tha
 He believed that the declaration of the freedom of slaves would lead to rebellion of slaves in the southern states and that they would not get the help of slaves in war

 Resolved the dispute over the rights of the long-standing provincial and federal states

 This meant that the union of states would remain undone and that the right to separatism would never arise again in the future
 vastutah grihayuddh ke parinaam ne is sanvaidhanik prashn ko hal kar diya ki rajyon ko sangh se alag hone kaa adhikaar nahin he
 In this way the principle of the "indestructible Union of Indestructible States" mentioned in the constitution was confirmed

 An important achievement of civil war in the social sphere was the abolition of slavery from America

 In all societies, children are born and brought up in the family
 bacchon kaa sanskaar karne or samaaj ke aachaar vyavhaar main unhen dikshit karne kaa kaam mukhya rup se parivaar main hota he
 Through this, the cultural heritage of the society is transferred from one generation to another

 Male-female sexual relationships are mainly fixed within the family
 audyogic sabhyataa se utpann jansankul samaajon or nagaron ko yadi chhod diya jaae to vyakti kaa parichay mukhyat: uske parivaar or kul ke aadhaar par hota he
 Although there are many distinctions of the family in terms of composition, size, relationship and work in different regions and different periods of the world, these above mentioned tasks are universal and universal

 Within the family, the division of sex between men and women is also universal and time-bound
 striyon kaa adhikansh samay ghar main vyateet hota he
 Making food, taking care of children and cleaning the house and sewing clothes etc
 are such tasks which come in the female part
 purush bahari tathaa adhik shram ke kaary karata he, jaise kheti, vyapaar, udyog, pashuchaaran, shikaar or ladaai aadi
 Even then, this division is not same in all societies, it is difficult to make even a large general list because in many societies women also take part in activities like farming and hunting
 yo Family forms are closely related to forms of marriage
 levis margan aadi vikasvaadiyon kaa mat he ki maanav samaaj kii praarambhik avasthaa main vivaah pratha nahin thi or purna kamachar prachlit tha
 This was followed by a state of youth marriage, polyandry, polyandry and monogamy or monogamy in the social development

 Therefore, this view does not appear to be evidence

 Mother's care in pregnancy and obstetric care is necessary
 phir, pashuon kii bhanti manushya main rati kii koi vishesh ritu nahin he
 Therefore, probably in the beginning of human society, either the entire community or a group of husband, wife and children was the family
 maanav vaigyanikon ko koi aisa samaaj nahin mila jahaan vivaah sambandh parivaar ke andar hi hote hon, at: pitristhaneey parivaar main patni ko or matrusthaneey parivaar main pati ko atirikt sadsyta pradaan kii jaati he
 In the couple's family, husband and wife together establish their separate household

 In industrialized countries like the USA, there has been a multiplicity of couples in place of a family of couples
 yadhyapi vahaan kaa samaaj pitruvansheey he, phir bhi yugal parivaar vahaan kisi ek brihattar kutumb kaa ang nahin mana jaataa
 The couple consists of a husband wife and, on birth, their unmarried children

 The circumference of blood relatives in the included family is different in different societies
 bharat jaise desh main ek sammilit parivaar main saadhaarant: 10-12 sadsy hote hai, kintu kuch pariwaron main sadasyon kii sankhya 50-60 yaa 100 tak hoti he
 Families have different forms and types based on different forms of marriage, lineage, ownership and authority
 matrusthaneey parivaar main pati apni patni ke ghar kaa sthaayee yaa asthaayee sadsy banataa he, jabaki pitristhaneey parivaar main patni pati ke ghar jaakar rahati he
 Maternal families are generally matriarchal and patrilineal families are patrilineal
 bahudhaa parivaar kii sampatti kaa swaamitv pitristhaneey parivaar main purush ko or matrusthaneey parivaar main nari ko praapt he
 The eldest child is usually the heir to the property
 kintu yah aavashyak nahin he
 In the tribe like Garo of India, only the smallest girl is the owner of the family property
 anek samaajon main parivaar ke sabhi stri yaa purush sadasyon main swamitv nihit hota he or kuch main purush tathaa stri donon ko sampatti kaa uttaradhikaar praapt he
 Family rule is ruled by men in most societies
 antar itnaa he ki pitruvansheey pariwaron main saadhaarant: pita athwa ghar kaa sabase bada purush or matruvansheey pariwaron main mamaa yaa mata kaa anya sabase bada raktasambandhi ghar kaa mukhiya hota he
 Therefore, in most parts of the world and in societies, male dominance is found
 sansar main daanpaty jivan main praaia: ekapatnitv hi sabase adhik prachlit he, yadhyapi anek samaajon main purushon ko ek se adhik patniyaan rakhane kii bhi chhot he
 In contrast, in the Toda and Khas tribes and in some regions of Tibet, there is a practice of polyandry and a type of youth marriage
 isi prakaar bharat main khaasi, gaaro or america main hopi, hedia jaisi janajatiyaan bhi hai jo matrusthaneey or matruvansheey hai
 In these forms of marriage there is a difference in the composition and form of the family

 In all earlier societies, the family was the most important and fundamental institution of society

 The family is no longer a unit of production in these industrial societies

 The responsibility of social security went to the state and due to the decreasing influence of religion, religious acts have been replaced by secondary
 pati or patni kaa adhikansh samay ghar ke baahar vyateet hota he
 Yet the family remains and carries out some important functions, which are called permanent or residual functions of the family
 janajatiyon main, jo saamaajik vikascram main aadim avasthaa ke adhik nikat hai, vivaah or parivaar ke praaia: sabhi prakaar milte hai
 From the point of view of development in these different types, it is not possible to determine the preorder
 kand mul or shikaar par basar karanevaale andamani aadimvasiyon main ekapatnitv kaa niyam he or ve pitruvansheey tathaa pitristhaneey hai
 The farming Hopi clan of North America has a practice of monogamy or monogamy but is matrilineal and maternal
 adhikansh janajaatiyon main parivaar kaa sanyukt rup he, kintu jahaan pati patni alag ghar main rahete hai, ve bhi ek brihattar parivaar ke ang hote hai or yah parivaar sammilit sampatti, aarthik kriyaaon, dharmik krityon tathaa anek pariwarik adhikaron evam kartavyon aadi se grathit ek pruthak ikai hota he
 Of the two genealogies, a tribe is either ancestral or matrilineal
 jo kabeeley matruvansheey hai ve praaia: matrusthaneey bhi hai, jahaan pati parivaar kaa sthaayee yaa asthaayee sadsy hota he
 In the Garo clan, it is only the visitor who is an overnight guest
 kintu matruvansheey or matrusthaneey kabeeley bahut kam hai
 The polyandry clan is even less
 pitruvansheey kabeelon main hi bahupati pratha pai gai he or inamen nari kaa varja purush kii apeksha hin he
 In the patriarchal tribes, men are often allowed to have more than one wife, but there is very little that only specific and powerful people can do
 aisi avasthaa main patniyaan ek ghar main bhi rahati hai or paas paas bane alag alag gharon main bhi
 Youth marriage in its pure form is not found in any clan

 In many ancestral tribes, the status of male and female is almost equal, however in most of the tribes, it is inferior to male
 kabeelon main vivahaviched or punarvivaah kaa niyam he or is sambandh se stri or purush ko praaia: samaan adhikaar hai
 In fact, most of the tribes are ancestral and the woman has to go to the family, family and colony of the man after marriage, where the husband has mother, father, brother and other blood relatives and friends
 vahaan use pati ke kutuban kaa ang hokar use bade logon ke anushaasan main rahanaa hota he or pati ke kulachaar kaa paalan karnaa hota he
 In the event of marriage, the woman has to take refuge in her parents
 matrusthaneey kabeelon main parivaar adhik sthaayee dikhaai padataa he
 This seems to be a natural group of blood relatives
 bahut kam kabeeley aise hai jahaan ladke yaa ladakiyon ko vivaah ke pehle brahmacharya paalan kaa niyam ho
 Some tribes have a pre-marriage trial period
 jonsaar babar ke khason main abhyaagton ke swaagat main parivaar kii avivaahit ladakiyon kaa sambhog ke liye prastut karne kii pratha he
 This makes it clear that the existence of the family is not for the male female lust, but is controlled by the family
 bharat mukhyat: krishipradhan desh he or yahan kii paariwarik rachana praaia: krishi kii aavashyaktaaon se prabhavit he
 In addition, the dignity and ideals of the Indian family are traditional
 kisi anya samaaz main grihasth jivan kii itani pavitrataa tathaa pita, putr bhai bhai or pati patni ke itane sthaayee sambandhon kaa udhaaharan nahin miltaa
 Although many distinctions are found in various fields, religions and castes in terms of the practice of secular rights, marriage and marriage, etc
, the ideal of joint family is well accepted
 sanyukt parivaar main sambandhiyon kaa dayera pati, patni tathaa unki avivaahit santanon se bhi adhik vyapak hota he
 Often, individuals of three generations and sometimes even more generations in the same discipline in a house and belonging to a kitchen consume the property involved and participate in the family's religious functions and rituals

 The joint family has its origins in ancient traditions and ideals in addition to India's agrarian economy

 Agriculture has provided the stability of family life everywhere
