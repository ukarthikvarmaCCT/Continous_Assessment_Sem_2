 It is chloride of lime and looks white like lime but has an odor of chlorine
 iskaa nirmaan sarvapratham glassgo ke charles tenant ne san 1799 main kiya tha
 Bleaching powder is not permanent

85 Chak Daulat is a village located in Handia block of Allahabad district of Uttar Pradesh state, India
 itihaas kaa prayog visheshat: do arthon main kiya jaataa he
 One is the events of ancient or past times and second is the perception about those events
 itihaas shabd kaa taatpary he "yah nishchay tha"
 The people of Greece used the term "histari" for history
 "histari" kaa shabdic arth "bunana" tha
 It is estimated that an attempt was made to weave known events in an orderly manner to present a picture that is meaningful and well-documented
 is prakaar itihaas shabd kaa arth he - parampara se praapt upaakhyaan samooh, virgatha yaa aitihaasik sakshya
 The subject we study under history describes chronological events or events related to it in chronological order
 duusare shabdon main maanav kii vishisht ghatnaon kaa naam hi itihaas he
 Or history is the description of events related to mankind, coming from antiquity to newness
 in ghatnaon va aitihaasik saakshyon ko tathy ke aadhaar par pramanit kiya jaataa he
 The mainstay of history are the epochs and remains of the site which are found in some form or the other
 jivan kii bahumukhi vyapaktaa ke kaaran swalp saamagree ke sahare vigat yug athwa samaaj kaa chitranirmaan karnaa du:saadhy he
 The more the material gets, the more proportionally it becomes possible to present the outline of the bygone era and society
 paryaapt sadhano ke hote hue bhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki kalpanamishrit chitra nishchit rup se shuddh yaa satya hi hoga
 Therefore, due to lack of appropriate attention, some scholars say that the entirety of history is irretrievable, yet if our experience and knowledge is abundant, our art is rationalized for the investigation of historical material and imagination is controlled and developed, then our picture of the past Can be more humane and authentic
 saransh yah he ki itihaas kii rachana main paryaapt saamagree, vaigyanik dhang se uski jaanch, usase praapt gyaan kaa mahatv samajhane ke vivek ke saath hi saath aitihaasak kalpana kii shakti tathaa sajiv chithran kii kshamta kii aavashyaktaa he
 It should be remembered that history is neither a science by ordinary definition nor a mere imaginary philosophy or literary work
 in sabake yathochit sanmishran se itihaas kaa swaroop rachaa jaataa he
 Written history began in the form of Virgatha in poetry or prose
 phir veeron athwa vishisht ghatnaon ke sambandh main anushruti athwa lekhak kii poochtacha se gadhy main rachana prarambh hui
 These types of articles are found on the tiles, stones, ulcers and clothes
 kaagaj kaa avishkaar hone se lekhan or pathan pathan kaa maarg prashast ho gaya
 The area and treasury of historical knowledge increased with the help of other types of material, such as ruins, bodies, utensils, metals, grains, coins, toys and means of transport, etc

 us sab saamagree kii jaanch padtaal kii vaigyanik kala kaa bhi vikaas hota gaya
 The art of confusing the received knowledge into living language has made astonishing progress, yet for the philosophy of the past, imagination is somewhat practiced, but mostly dependent on the natural ability and subtle and revolutionary vision of the person
 yadhyapi itihaas kaa aarambh asia main hua, tathaapi uskaa vikaas europe main vishesh rup se hua
 It is a special credit to the Chinese in Asia, but more than that to the Islamic people, who knew the importance of chronology well
 musalamaanon ke aane ke pehle hinduon kii itihaas sambandh main apni anokhi dhaaran thi
 Instead of chronology, they were appeased by collecting some of the basic elements of the era of cultural and religious development or degradation and symbolically describing the propagation and symbolism of thoughts and feelings
 unka itihaas praaia: kavyarup main miltaa he jisamen sab kachi-pakki saamagree mili juli, uljhi or guthi padi he
 Some efforts are being made to resolve it, but due to lack of chronology, there are severe difficulties
 vartmaan sadi main europea shiksha main dikshit ho jane se aitihaasik anusandhan kii hindustan main uttarottar unnati hone lagi he
 There are no thousands of streams of history
 sthool rup se unka prayog raajnneetik, aarthik or saamaajik kshetron main adhik hua he
 Apart from this, now people have become more interested in acquiring knowledge of the public and its relation by not limiting them
 bharat main itihaas ke strot hai: rugveda or anya veda jaise yajurveda, samaveda, atharvaveda granth, itihaas puranasmriti granth aadi
 These are called historical materials
 pashchim main herodotus ko pratham itihaaskaar maanate hai
 The field of history is very wide
 prayek vyakti, vishay, anveshan andolan aadi kaa itihaas hota he, yahan tak ki itihaas kaa bhi itihaas hota he
 Hence, it can be said that historical approach has its own special feature like other philosophical, scientific etc
 vah ek vichaarstyli he jo praarambhik puraatan kaal se or visheshat: 17veen sadi se sabhy sansar main vyaapt ho gai
 Historical knowledge of its development is considered essential for the study of each subject from the 19th century onwards
 itihaas ke adhyayan se maanav samaaj ke vividh kshetron kaa jo vyaavhaarik gyaan praapt hota he usase manushya kii paristhitiyon ko aankane, vyaktiyon ke bhaavon or vichaaron tathaa jansamooh kii pravritiyon aadi ko samajhane ke liye badi suvidha or acchhee khaasi kasuti mil jaati he
 History is often written of cities, provinces and special countries or eras
 ab is ore cheshtha or praytn hone lage hai ki yadi sambhav ho to sabhy sansar hi nahin, varan manushya maatr ke samuhik vikaas yaa vinaash kaa adhyayan bhugol ke samaan kiya jaae
 Proven to this goal, though not impossible, is very difficult
 iske praathmik maanchitr se yah anumaan hota he ki vishwa ke santoshjanak itihaas ke liye bahut lambey samay, prayaas or sanghathan kii aavashyaktaa he
 Some scholars are of the opinion that if the study of world history and human tendencies were attempted to extract some universal principles, then history would lose its individual feature by turning into sociology
 yah bhay itnaa chintajanak nahin he, kyonki samajashaastra ke liye itihaas kii utani hi aavashyaktaa he jitani itihaas ko samaajashastra kii
 In fact, the creation of sociology is possible only on history
 sainya itihaas yuddh, ranneetiyon, yuddh, hathiyaar or yuddh ke manovigyaan se sambandhit he
 The "new military history" since the 1970s deals with more soldiers than manpower, and more psychology than strategy, and the wider impact of war on society and culture
 dharm kaa itihaas sadiyon se dharmanirpeksh or dharmik itihaaskaaron donon ke liye ek mukhya vishay rahaa he, or seminar or academy main padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Leading journals include Church History, Catholic Historical Review, and History of Religion
 vishay vyapak rup se raajnneetik or saanskrithik or kalatmak ayaamon se lekar dharamshastra or maranottar git tak failaa hua he
 This subject studies religions in all regions and places of the world where humans live
 saamaajik itihaas, jise kabhi-kabhi "nae saamaajik itihaas" kaha jaataa he, ek aisa kshetra he jisamen saamaanya logon ke itihaas or jivan ke saath saamana karne ke liye unki ranneetiyaan shaamil hai
 In its "golden Age" in the 1960s and 1970s, it was a prominent subject among scholars, and still holds a good foothold in the departments of history
 1975 se 1995 tak do dashakon main, america itihaas ke prophessoron kaa anupaat saamaajik itihaas ke saath-saath 31% se badhkar 41% ho gaya, jabaki raajnneetik itihaaskaaron kaa anupaat 40% se 30% tak gir gaya
 Cultural history replaced social history in the 1980s and 1990s
 yah aam taur par nrivigyaan or itihaas ke drushtikon ko bhashaa, lokapriy saanskrithik paramparaon or aitihaasik anubhavon kii saanskrithik vyakhyaaon ko dekhne ke liye jodatii he
 It examines past knowledge, customs and art records and descriptive descriptions of a group of people
 logon ne kaise ateet kii apni smriti kaa nirmaan kiya he, yah ek pramukh vishay he
 Cultural history also includes the study of art in society, as well as the study of images and human visual production
 rajanyik itihaas rashtron ke bich sambandhon par kendrit he, mukhyatah kootneeti or yuddh ke kaarnon ke bare main
 Recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights
 yah aam taur par videshi karyaalay ke drushtikon or lambii avadhi ke ranneetik mulyon ko prastut karata he, jaisaa ki nirantarata or itihaas main parivartan kii prerana shakti he
 This type of political history is the study of the conduct of international relations between countries or state borders over time
 itihaaskaar murial chemberlen ne likhaa he ki pratham vishwa yuddh ke baad, "rajanyik itihaas ne aitihaasik jaanch ke pramukh ke rup main sanvaidhanik itihaas kaa sthaan le liya, joki kabhi sabase aitihaasik, sabase sateek or aitihaasik adhyayanon ke sabase parishkrut tha"
 He said that after 1945, the trend has reversed, now social history has replaced it

 When she returns home, she fights with the technique taught at the institute instead of her father's taught technique
 iske baad mahavir or gita main mukkebaaji hoti he or apane badhati umr ke kaaran mahavir usase haar jaataa he
 Babita tells her sister Geeta that the place she is in now is due to her father's technique and she should not forget her father's technique
 gita kii tarah babita bhi us santhaan main chale jaati he
 Geeta continues to lose every match, because she does not pay full attention to the technique or wrestling taught by her father
 usne apane nakhun badha liye rahete hai or rang bhi laga rakhaa hota he saath main apane baalo ko bhi kaaphi lanbaa rakhen hone kaaran bhi use haar kaa saamana karnaa padate rahata he
 She realizes her mistake and she reveals this to Mahavir
 mahavir uske santhaan main aa kar un donon ko prashikshan dene lagata he

 uske baad yah nirnay hua ki un donon ko santhaan main tabhi rakhaa ja saktaa he jab mahavir santhaan main na aae or un donon ko kahin koi prashikshan na de
 Mahavir then watches Geeta's old video in which she loses and tells Geeta about her mistake by phone
 komanwealth khelon main gita hissaa le leti he or mahavir uske coach ke nirdeshon ke vipareet darshakon ke saath baith jaataa he
 Geeta does not fight against the methods taught by her coach and fights in the ways taught by her father and wins every time
 us coach ko mahavir se jalan hone lagati he or is kaaran vah mahavir ko ek kamare main band kar detaa he
 Even in Mahavir's absence, Geeta wins the gold medal and becomes the first female wrestler in India to win a gold medal
 sahi samay par mahavir vahaan se nikal aata he or samachar media ke saamne vah coach apana shrey nahin le paata he

 holting problem nimnlikhit nirnay problem ko kehete hai: The example above is not a question, but a set of questions
 problemon kii kul sankhya agananeey anant he par sambhav algoridmon kii kul sankhya gananeey anant he

 In fact, uncountable infinity is so much greater than countable infinity that if a decision problem is chosen randomly from a set of decision problems, it is 100% likely to be undecided

 ho jane ke kaaran, finemen use chuum bhi nahin sakate the
 He knew that his relationship with Arlene would be only spiritual
 in sab ke baavjood, finemen arlin se shaadi karnaa chaahate the
 His family and friends were against this marriage
 is bare me unki apane pita se anban bhi ho gayi
 Despite this, the finemen married Arlene
 finemen, jab los elmos main kaam kar rahe the to vahaan ke nideshak raubart openhaimar ne arlin ko paas hi ke seniterium main bharti karvaa diya taaki finemen usase mil sake
 Arlene died while the Finemen were in Los Almos
 is ghatana chakra par ek pikchar bhi bani he jiskaa naam infinity ) he ise matheyu bordwik ne nirdeshit kiya he
 Finemen were alive and often worked for fun
 mouj masti me hi unhone us vishay par kaam kiya jis par unhe nobel puruskaar mila
 This is also an interesting anecdote
 duusare mahayuddh ke dauraan los elmos laboretary main finemen kii mitrataa beth se hui jinase unki kaaphi patati thi
 Beth was in the court, so the finmen also went to the court
 ek din ve kauranal ke alpaahar grih main baithe the
 a student threw a plate there
 plate safed rang kii thi or usamen bich main kauranal kaa laal rang kaa chinh tha
 The plate was also wavering and moving around
 yah ajeeb nazaaraa tha
 The finemen began to waver and roar and to find a relationship between them
 isame kaaphi mushkil ganit ke sameekaran lagate the
 It took him a lot of time
 unhone paaya ki dono me 2:1 kaa sambandh he
 His colleagues told him why he is wasting time in it
 unka jawaab tha, 'it does not matter, i am doing all this for fun
 ' But he was not right about its importance
 ve jab electron ke ghoomane ke bare main shodh karne lage to unhen kauranal kii dagamagaati or gumti plate main lagi ganit phir se yaad aane lagi
 This led to the principle that he received the Nobel Prize
 sach he jivan main bahut kuch vah bhi aavashyak he jo keval mouj masti ke liye ho, chaahe uskaa koi or mahatv ho yaa na ho - mouj masti hi apane aap me ek mahatv kii baat he

 i have started this article in the introduction of cal-tech lectures on physics by Finemen
 in lekcharon ko unhone sitambar 1961-may 1963 me diya tha
 These lectures were special, so they were kept safe forever and later these three were printed as red books
 finemen saptaah main keval do lacture dete the baaki samay vah in lekcharon ko taiyaar karne main lagaate the
 They used to consider every line of lecture, every joke in advance
 kabhi bhi unke saath lacture ke notus nahin hote the
 There was only a small paper in which some special words were there only to indicate further
 yah teen saal, sansar me kisi bhi vishvavidhyalay ke, kisi bhi vishay par ke lekcharon me adwitiya hai
 It never happened like this or maybe it will happen again
 kyonki malum nahin ki phir kabhi aisa vyakti aayegaa ki nahin
 English was a useless and philosophical subject for the fine men
 Religion se unka koi vaasta nahin tha
 It was not in his interest to talk about the rounds
 vah hameshaa sidhi baat karte the
 They meant what they used to say
 ve is baat se bhramit ho jate the yadi unki sidhi baat duusare ko pareshaan kar detii thi

 The commission began airing its findings in front of TV
 us samay tivi par hi, sabake saamne finemen ne ekadam thande pani ke andar ghatiya saamaan ko daal kar dikhaaya ki vastav main visphot kyon hua tha
 It was a live telecast, so the performance of The Finemen could not be stopped, and this two-minute clip became the world's most played news clip within a few hours
 finemen pisadina main aksar vahiin ke ek restaraan me jate the, jahaan par toplace pariveshikaayen rahati thim
 In that restaurant, he used to tell his master the physics and he was painting them
 ek baar police waalon ko laga ki us restaraan main kuch gadabad- sadabad hota he or restaraan ke maalik par ashleelata kaa mukadmaa chalaaya
 In fact, there was no such work
 us restaraan main kai pratishthit vyakti aate the restaraan ke maalik ne un sabase gavaahi dene kii prarthana kii
 Everybody cut the trench with silence, but the finemen did not
 unhone restaraan maalik ke paksh main gavaahi di or agle din akhabaaron ke pehle panne par sabase mukhya khabar ke rup main chhapi

 It was built by Pakistan like its outpost 'qaid' within the Indian border, which cannot be named other than encroachment
 jaahir he, bharat ke liye is ghatana kii jaankaree paakar chup baithna sambhav nahin tha

 Anyway, Bana Singh managed to reach the top with his companions
 vahaan pahunch kar usne apane dal ko do hissen main baantkar do dishaao main tainaat kiya or phir us 'kaayad post' par grenade phenkane shuru kiya
 Grenades showed their work in the bunkers built there
 saath hi duusare dal ke javaanon ne dushman ke sainikon ko, joki us chaowkee par the, banet se maut ke ghat utaarna shuru kar diya
 Pakistan's Special Service Group commandos were stationed there, who died in this sudden attack and escaped leaving some posts

 The front was destroyed
