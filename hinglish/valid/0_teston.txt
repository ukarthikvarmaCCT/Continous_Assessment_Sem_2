 The method of using electric power to pull a train, tram or any other type of vehicle is called electric traction
 is kshetra main, vaashp ingine tathaa anya duusare prakaar ke ingine hi saamaanya rup se prayog kiye jate rahe hai
 The use of electric power for traction is relatively new, but due to its special features, its use has increased and is slowly replacing other means

 According to these characteristics, direct current range motors are the most suitable and commonly used, but direct current motors are generally not suitable for actuation at high voltages and due to this
 Traction mechanisms are generally up to 3,000 volts

 But these motors are not able to give suitable characteristics at normal power frequency

 Therefore, normally, or 25 cyclic frequency is used for traction
 is kaaran inhen saamaanya sanbharanatantron se nahin sambharan kiya ja saktaa he
 Being a latent system, there is also a problem of phase balance at the sub-center

 History is particularly used in two ways
 ek he pracheen athwa vigat kaal kii ghatnaayen or doosraa un ghatnaon ke vishay main dharna
 The word history implies "it was sure"
 greece ke log itihaas ke liye "histari" shabd kaa prayog karte the
 "histari" literally meant "weave"
 anumaan hota he ki gyaat ghatnaon ko vyavasthit dhang se bunakar aisa chitra upasthit karne kii koshish kii jaati thi jo sarthak or susambaddha ho
 Thus the word history means anecdote group, veeragatha or historical evidence derived from tradition
 itihaas ke antargat ham jis vishay kaa adhyayan karte hai usamen ab tak ghatit ghatnaon yaa usase sambandh rakhanevaali ghatnaon kaa kalkrmanusaar varnan hota he
 In other words, history is the name of specific human events
 yaa phir pracheenta se naveenta kii ore aane vaali, maanavjaati se sambandhit ghatnaon kaa varnan itihaas he
 These events and historical evidence are proved on the basis of fact
 itihaas ke mukhya aadhaar yugavishesh or ghatnasthal ke ve avshesh hai jo kisi na kisi rup main praapt hote hai
 Due to the multifaceted pervasiveness of life, it is inauspicious to paint the past era or society with the help of self-material
 saamagree jitani hi adhik hoti jaati he usee anupaat se beete yug tathaa samaaj kii ruparekha prastut karnaa saadhy hota jaataa he
 Notwithstanding adequate means, it cannot be said that the imaginary picture will certainly be pure or true

 The summary is that in the creation of history, there is a need for adequate material, scientific investigation, the discretion to understand the importance of the knowledge gained from it, as well as the power of historical imagination and the ability to depict life
 samaran rakhana chahie ki itihaas na to saadhaaran paribhaasha ke anusaar vigyaan he or na keval kaalpanik darshan athwa saahitiyik rachana he
 The history of these is formed by proper mixing

 Before the arrival of Muslims, Hindus had their own unique conception in history

 Their history is often found in poetic form in which all the raw material is mixed, tangled and intertwined
 uske sulajhane ke kuch-kuch praytn hone lage hai, kintu kalkram ke abhaav main bhayankar kathinaaiyaan pad rahi hai

 Velociraptor drumiosaurides is a lineage of theropod dinosaurs that lived around 75 to 71 million years ago during the post-cretaceous period
 do prajatiyaan vartmaan main manyata praapt hai, haalanki anya ko ateet main saunpa gaya he
 This type of species is V
 mongoliensis; Fossils of this species have been discovered in Mongolia
 Another species, V
 osmolski, was named in 2008 for skull material from Inner Mongolia, China
 dinonichas or echillobator kii tarah anya dramiyosorides kii tulana main chote, velosiropter ne ek hi shaareerik visheshtaon ke kai saajha de rahi he
 It was a bipedal, winged carnivore with a long tail on each hanput and an elongated fork-shaped claw, which is believed to have been used to ward off prey
 velosiropter anya dramiyosorides se apane lambey or nicha khopadi, ek upar uthaa hua thuthan ke saath pratishthit kiya ja saktaa he
 Velociraptor is one of the most familiar dinosaur generation to the general public due to its prominent role in Jurassic Park's motion picture series
 haalanki, vaastavik jivan main, velosiropter lagbhag ek turki kaa aakaar tha, jo filmon main lagbhag 2 meter lanbaa 80 kigra sarisrup ke tarah dekhaya gaya tha
 Today, the fossil scientist is well known about the Velociraptor

 One particularly well-known specimen holds a Velokirapore lock in a fight with a Protosyrtops

 The skull, which grew up to 25 cm long, was typically concave on the upper surface and convex on the lower
 jabade har taraf 26-28 vyapak rup se daant ke saath khadey hote the, prayek mohare ke mukaable pichde kinare par adhik majbootee se daantedaar hote the
 The Velociraptor, like other Dromiosurides, was a large manus with three rigidly curved claws, similar to the construction and flexibility of the bones of modern bird feathers

 The wrist of the carpal bones was restrained without the wrist and forced the hands to face within the surface of the foothills, not downwards
 pair ke pehle ank, jaise anya theropeed ke rup main, ek chote se dhakkan tha
 However, while the majority of therapods had legs with three digits, velocyredores such as drumiosaurids only walked the third and fourth digits

 This enlarged claw, which can extend upwards of 6
5 centimeters to its outer extremity, was probably used to prevent or control a predator device in hunting

 Prezigapophyses started from the tenth tail vertebrae and proceeded to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on the position in the tail
 ye ek baar poonch ko puri tarah se kathor karne ke liye samajha gaya tha, puri poonch ko ek rod jaise unit ke rup main kaary karne ke liye majaboor kiya gaya tha
 However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae in an S-shaped curved arm, suggesting that there were once relatively more horizontal flexibilities than once thought
 2007 main, peleontists ne mongolia se ek acchhee tarah se sangrakshit velokirapore mongoliansis prakoshth par quil ghundi kii khoj kii soochna di, is prajati main pankh kii maujuudagi kii pushti kii
 Fossils of the more ancient Drumaeosaurids compared to Velociraptor have wings covering their bodies and fully developed winged wings

 In September 2007, researchers found quill rotations on the edge of a velociraptor found in Mongolia
 These barriers on the wings of bird feathers show that their presence on the wing anchor and veliceraptor suggests that it also has wings
 peleotologist alan turnar ke anusaar, Co-author Mark Norell, curator-in-charge of fossil reptiles, amphibians and birds at the American Museum of Natural History was also turning up on the discovery, saying: The more we learn about these animals the more we find That there is basically no difference between birds and their closely related dinosaur ancestors such as Velociraptor
 donon ne ichhashakti, apane ghonsle ko peeta, khokhale haddiyon ke paas, or pankhons main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 If animals like the valciraptor were alive then our first impression would be that they were very unusual looking birds

 The propulsion sample on which the quill horse racing was found represents an animal 1

 The authors emphasized that there is this type of variation in the number of feather feathers between adjacent species, it is to be expected, given similar differences between modern birds
 turnar or sahakarmiyon ne velosiropter par pankhons kii upasthiti ko is vichaar ke khilaaf saboot ke rup main samajhaayaa ki bada, uda-rahit manipuriyon ne bade aakaar ke aakaar ke kaaran duusari ore apane pankh kho die
 In addition, he said that horse racing is almost never found in today's flightless bird species, and that their presence in the Velociraptor is evidence that the ancestors of Dromysoraeids can fly Velociraptor and other large members of this family Direct flightless, although it is possible that the large feathers anticipated in Velokirapore's ancestors had purposes other than wing flight

 On August 11, 1923, during an American Museum of Natural History expedition to the Outer Mongolian Gobi Desert, Peter Kaizen retrieved the first Velociraptor fossil known to science: a crushed but complete skull, one of the Rapparich II tow claws is

 However, because the name "ovoraptor" was not published in a scientific journal or with formal description, it is considered a nomenclature nudum, and the name Velociraptor retains priority

 In the phylogenic taxonomy, Veloraptorinae is generally defined as "all Dramyosaurs more closely related to Velociraptor"

 However, as animals were preserved in ancient sand piled deposits, it is now believed that the animals were buried in sand, either by falling or sandy humus

 The distinctive claw on the second issue of the dromaeosaurids, traditionally depicted as a slashing weapon; Its truncation is being used to cut and hunt
 
 In the "fighting Dinosaur" specimen, Valocerapore is located below, with one of its heel claws apparently embedded in the throat of its prey, while the beak of Protoceratops clamps down on its attacker's right foregut
 isse pataa chalata he ki valocyrapor ne pet main kami karne ke bajaay gale ke mahatvapurn angon, jaise gaththa nas, caroted dhamni yaa shwaasanlee ko gale lagane ke liye apni sical ke panjon kaa istemaal kiya ho saktaa he
 The inside edge of the claw was rounded and not unusually sharp, which could not prevent any bite or disturbance action, although only the origin of the paw bone is known
 twachaa kii moti pet kii diwaar or badi shikaar prajatiyon kii mansapeshiyon ko vishesh kataai sataha ke bina slesh karnaa mushkil hota
 The slashing hypothesis was tested during a 2005 BBC documentary, The Truek About Killer Dinosaur

 dininichus ke avshesh, ek kareebi se sambandhit dramiyosoread, aamtaur par kai vyaktiyon ke agrigrajeshan main paae jate hai
 Deinonycus is found in association with a large plant, Tenontosaurus, which has been seen as evidence of cooperative hunting

 However no evidence of cooperative hunting was found
 yadhyapi mongolia main velisirapore ke kai alag-alag jeevashm paae gaye hai, koi bhi anya vyaktiyon ke saath nikatataa se judaa hua nahin tha
 Therefore, while Velokirapor is commonly depicted as a pack hunter, as Jurassic Park, only limited fossil evidence is available to support this theory for drumiosourceids in general, and none for velcroraptor Not Specific The pack hunting theory was based on a discovery of several specimens of Denonichus that were found around the remains of Tenontosaurus
 nikat sahyog main drumeosaureeds kaa koi anya samooh paaya nahin gaya he
 In 2011, Denver Fowler and his colleagues suggested a new method by which Velocirapore and similar drumiosources such as Dramiosource could capture and deter hunting
 yah model, jise "ropter shikaar sanyam" model ke rup main janaa jaataa he, prastaavit karata he ki dramiyosorce ne apane shikaar ko shikariyon ke vartmaan acicitid pakshiyon kii tarah hi maar daalaa he: apane khadaan par chalaang lagaakar, apane sharir ke vajan ke neeche rakhkar, or bade, sical ke aakaar vaale panje ke saath kasakar ise pakadana
 These researchers proposed that, such as acipritrides, drumiosaurs would then begin feeding on the animal while it was still alive and that the prey died eventually from blood loss and organ failure
 yah prastaav praathmik rup se gyaat shikari vyavhaaron ke saath maujuuda pakshiyon ke shikaar ke kai samoohon ke aakaar or aakaar ke paay or pairon ke pairon or pairon ke bich tulana par aadhaarit he
 Fowler found that the drumosource's feet and legs are most similar to those of the eagle and hawk, especially as an increased second tap and equal speed of movement
 haalanki choti metatas or pair kii takat, ullu ke samaan adhik hoti
 The RPR method of hunting would be consistent with other aspects of the valicirapore's anatomy, such as their unusual jaw and arm morphology arms, which can apply great force but are likely to involve long wings, for balance use
 Can be done as a stabilizer, while over a struggling prey animal, with a hard resistant tail

 The Quran, the Quran or Koran is the holiest book of Islam and its foundation
 musalmaan maanate hai ki ise allaah ne farishte jibril dwaara hazarat mohammad ko sunaaya tha
 Muslims believe that the Quran is the last and supreme book sent by Allah
 yah granth lagbhag 1400 saal pehle avataran hui he
 According to the beliefs of Islam, Hazrat Muhammad was revealed by the Qur'an Allah's angel Jibril until his death in 61032

 Muslims believe that the last of the holy messages sent by God are written in the Quran
 in sandeshon kii shuruyaat aadam se hui thi
 Hazrat Adam was the earliest prophet in Islamic beliefs and can be compared to an extent with the Manu of Hinduism
 jis tarah se hindu dharm main manu kii santanon ko maanav kaha gaya he vaise hi islam main aadam kii santanon ko aadmi kaha jaataa he
 Tauheed, religious order, Jannat, Jahannam, Patience, Dharma are subjects of perenniality which were repeated again and again

 The Quran presented the ideals of war, peace, state governance, family, which have influence in human society today
 musalamaanon ke anusaar kuran main die gaye gyaan se ye sabit hota he ki hazarat mohammad ek islamic pigambar nabi he | The first mention of the word "qur'an" is found in the Qur'an itself where it means - he read, or he read
 yah shabd iske syrian samanaantar courienna kaa arth letaa he jiskaa arth hota he granthon ko padhanaa
 Although Westernists associate it with the Syrian word, most Muslims believe that its root is the word Qur'a
 par chaahe jo hazarat mohammad ke janmdin ke samay hi yah ek arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 The word has been mentioned some 70 times in the Qur'an itself
 iske alaave bhi koran ke kai naam hai
 It has also been addressed by names such as Al Furaqan, Al Hikmah, Dhikr / Zikr and Mashhaf
 koran main allaah ne 25 ambia kaa zikr kiya he
 The word Quran appears about 70 times in the Quran, which assumes different meanings
 yah arabi kriya qara kaa ek maukhik sangya he, jiskaa arth he "vah padhata he"
 Syriac is the equivalent qarayana, which refers to "reading scripture" or "lesson"
 jabaki kuch pashchimi vidwaan is shabd ko siriek se praapt karne par vichaar karte hai, muslim adhikariyon ke bahumat main shabd kii utpatti qara hi hoti he
 Regardless, it had become an Arabic word during Muhammad's lifetime
 shabd kaa ek mahatvapurn arth "paath kaa kaary" he, jaisaa ki praarambhik kurani maarg main darshaya gaya he: "yah hamaare liye ise ikattha karnaa or ise padhanaa he 
 In other verses, the term refers to "a personal passage"
 iskaa kai sandarbh main kai prakaar se adab kiya jaataa he
 As an example: "when al-quran is recited, listen to it and be silent
 " anya dharmon ke granth jaise torah or susamachar ke saath varnit arth bhi grahan kar saktaa he
 The word also has synonyms which are employed throughout the Quran
 prayek samanaarthi kaa apana alag arth hota he, lekin iskaa upyog kuch sandarbhon main quran ke saath mil saktaa he
 In such words the book, Ayah; And sura
 baad ke do shabd bhi prakaashan kii ikaayiyon ko darshaate hai
 In the large majority of references, usually with a definite article, the term is referred to as "publication", which has been "sent" at intervals
 anya sambandhit shabd hai: dhikkaar, quran ko ek anusmarak or chetavanee ke arth main sanderbhit karata he, or hikmah, kabhi-kabhi prakaashan yaa iske hisse kaa zikr karata he
 The Quran describes itself as "prudence", "mother of texts", "guide", "wisdom", "remembrance"
 or "rahasyodghatan" 
 Another word is al-kitab, although it is also used in Arabic for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Bible
 musahaf shabd kaa prayog aksar vishesh kuranik lipiyon ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he lekin quran main bhi pehle kii kitabon kii pahchaan karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation during his prayer in the cave of Hira on the mountains
 iske baad, unhen 23 varshon kii avadhi main puraa koran kaa khulaasa praapt hua
 According to the hadith and Muslim history, after Muhammad came to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his companions to read the Quran and learn and teach the laws, which were told daily
 yah sambandhit he ki kuch kurash jinhen badr kii ladaai main kaidiyon ke rup main le jaaya gaya tha, unhone kuch musalamaanon ko us samay ke saral lekhan ko sikhaye jane ke baad apni aazaadee hasil kar lee
 Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate
 jaisaa ki shuru main kaha gaya tha, quran ko takhton, khaalon, haddiyon, or ke tane ke chaude lakadiyon par darj kiya gaya tha
 Most suras were in use among Muslims as they have been mentioned in many hadiths and histories by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating to Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, as a way of praying and reading
 haalanki, quran 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke samay pustak rup main maujuud nahin tha
 There is an agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write the revelation
 sahih al-bukaari haddees main mohammad ko rahasyodghatan kaa varnan karte hue bataaya, "kabhi-kabhi yah ghanti bajane kii tarah " or aaisha ne bataaya, "maine dekha ki paigambar bahut hi thande din main vahi se prerit ho rahe hai or unke maathe se pasinaa nikal rahaa tha
 As soon as the inspiration of the same was over, his restlessness would go away
 " quran ke anusaar mohammad kaa pehla prakaashan, ek drushti ke saath tha
 The medium of revelation is described as "a powerful one", a person who was "on the topmost horizon when clear to see
 phir vah nikat aa gaya or mohammad se baat karne laga
 "islamic study scholars state in the Welch encyclopedia that they believe that Muhammad's condition and descriptions at these moments can be considered real, as he was severely disturbed after these revelations
 velch ke mutabik, mohammad kii preranaon kii atimanvi utpatti ke liye unke aas-paas ke logon ne in daure ko dekha hoga
 However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a person, a poet, or a magician because his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures in ancient Arabia
 velch atirikt rup se bataata he ki yah anishchit he ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke praarambhik daawey se pehle yaa baad main ye anubhav hue the
 The Quran describes Muhammad as "ummi", which is traditionally interpreted as "uneducated", but its meaning is more complex
 madhyakaalin tippaneekaron jaise al-tabari ne kaha ki is shabd ne do arthon ko prerit kiya: pehla, saamaanya rup se padhane yaa likhane main asamarthta; doosraa, pichhali kitabon yaa granthon kii anubhavheenata yaa agyanta 
 Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as an indication of the reality of his prophecy
 udhaaharan ke liye, fakhruddin al-raji ke anusaar, yadi mohammad ne lekhan or padhai main maharath hasil kii thi to sambhawatah unhen purvajon kii kitabon kaa adhyayan karne kaa andeh hota
 Some scholars, like Watt, prefer the second meaning of "ummi" - they first take it to indicate unfamiliarity with sacred texts
 quran kii antim aayat varsh 10veen hijri main dhu al-hijjah ke islamic maheene ke 18 veen tarikh ko prakat hui thi, jo ek taarikh he jo mote taur par farvari yaa march 632 se mail khaati he 
 This was revealed after the Prophet gave his sermon in Ghadir e Khumm
 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke baad, unke kai saathi jo quran ko kanthst jaanate the, musalimaa dwaara yamama kii ladaai main maare gaye the
 The first Khalifa, Abu Bakr, later decided to gather the book into a book to preserve it
 zayd ebn thabit quran ko ikattha karne vaale pehle vyakti the kyonki vah allaah ke nabi mohammad se padhe gaye aaayaaton or suron ko likhaa karte the
 Thus, the most important of the classical group, Zaid bin Thabit, collected verses and compiled the entire book to give the Qur'an the form of a book
 is tarah quran ek granth ke rup main aagai or uski prati abu bakr ke saath hi rahi
 For this work, Zaid has cropped all the pages which were written on the bone, on the leaves, on the stones and many people had memorized them
 abu bakar ke baad, mohammad kii vidhwaa hafasa bint umr ko lagbhag 650 main is pandulipi ko saunpa gaya tha
 The third Caliph Uthman ibn Afan began to notice slight differences in the pronunciation of the Quran as Islam spread beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa
 paath kii pavitrataa ko sangrakshit karne ke liye, unhone jayad kii adhyakshata main ek samiti kaa aadesh diya taaki abu bakar kii pratilipi kaa upyog kiya ja sake or quran kii ek maanak prati taiyaar kii ja sake
 Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed in written form
 yah paath us model ban gaya jahaan se muslim duniya ke shahari kendron main pratiyaan banaai gayi or prakshepit kii gayi, or anya sanskarnon ko nasht kar diya gaya mana jaataa he
 The current form of Quran recitation is considered by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr
 shiya ke anusaar, ali ebn abi talib ne mohammad kii mrityu ke turant baad quran kaa ek purna sanskaran sankalit kiya
 The sequence of this text was gathered later during Uthman's era that this version was collected in chronological order
 iske baavjood, unhone manakikrut quran ke khilaaf koi aapatti nahin kii or quran ko parisancharan main sweekaar kar liya
 Other individual copies of the Quran may exist, including the codecs of Ibn Mas'ud and Ube ibn Ka'b, none of which exist today
 quran mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan bikhri hui likhit rup main sabase adhik sambhaavna he
 Several sources indicate that a large number of his companions had missed the revelation during Muhammad's lifetime
 praarambhik tippaniyan or islamic aitihaasik strot quran ke shuruaati vikaas kii uparyukt samaj kaa samarthan karte hai
 The Quran in its current form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad as the discovery of variants has not given much importance
 chicago vishvavidhyalay ke professor fred donor ne kaha ki "


 quran ke ek samaan vyanjan paath ko sthapit karne kaa ek bahut hi shuruaati prayaas tha, jo sambhawatah sancharan main sambandhit granthon kaa ek vyapak or adhik vividh samooh tha
 After the creation of this standardized canonical text, the first official texts were suppressed, and all existing manuscripts — despite their many variants — seem to date back to a time after the establishment of this standard consonant text
 " haalanki quran ke paath ke adhikansh sanskaran reeding ko prasaarit karnaa band kar diya gaya he, kuch abhi bhi hai
 There has been no significant text on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text can be based
 aitihaasik rup se, quran kii saamagree par vivaad shaayad hi kabhi ek mudda ban gaya he, haalanki is vishay par bahes jari he
 In 1972, in a mosque in the city of Sana'a, Yemen, manuscripts were discovered that later proved to be the oldest Quranic text existing at the time
 sanaa kii pandulipiyon main ek prishth he jisamen se charmpatr pun: prayojya banane ke liye dhoyaa gaya he- ek abhyaas jo pracheen samay main lekhan saamagree kii kami ke kaaran aam tha
 However, the faint washed-out underlying text is still barely visible and is considered "pre-uthmanic" Quranic content, while the text written at the top is considered Uthmanic time
 radiocarbon dating kaa upyog karne vaale adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki charmpatr 671 sii se pehle kii avadhi ke liye 99 pratishat sambhaavna ke saath dinaankit hai
 In 2015, very early Quran fragments dating back 1370 years were discovered in the library of the University of Birmingham, England
 oxford uniwarsity radiocarbon excelerator unit dwaara kiye gaye pareekshanon ke mutabik, "95% se adhik kii sambhaavna ke saath, charmpatr 568 or 645 ke bich tha"
 The manuscript is written in the Hijaji script, an early form of Liza Arabic
 yah sambhawatah quran kaa sabase purana udhaaharan he, lekin pareekshanon kii ek vistrut taarikh kii anumati he, isliye yah nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa ki maujuuda sanskarnon main se koun sa sabase purana he
 Saudi scholar Saud al-sarhan has expressed doubts over the age of the fragments because they contain dots and chapter separators that are believed to have originated later
 muslimon kaa maananaa he ki quran 23 saal kii avadhi main allaah ne jibril ke madhyam se ishwar se mohammad se divya maargdarshan kii pustak ban gaya he or quran ko maanavtaa ke liye bhagwaan ke antim prakaashan ke rup main dekhtaa he
 Revelation in Islamic and Quranic contexts means the act of God addressing a person, sending a message to a large number of recipients
 jis prakriya se ishwar ke sandeshvahak ke dil main divine sandesh aata he vah tanzil yaa nuzul he
 As the Quran states, "with the truth we have sent it down and with the truth it has come down
 " The Quran often emphasizes in its text that it is divinely ordained
 quran main kuch chand yah ingit karte hai ki arabi bolne vaale bhi log quran ko samajhenge agar unhen sunaaya jaataa he
 The Quran refers to a written pre-text, "protected tablet", which records the speech of God even before it is sent
 quran shaashvat yaa banaaya gaya mudda yah mudda nauveen shatabdi main ek dharmik bahes ban gaya
 Mu'tazilas, an Islamic school of theology based on logic and rational thought, stated that the Quran was created, while the most widespread varieties of Muslim theologians considered the Quran to be co-eternal with God and therefore unskilled
 sufi darshanik is sawaal ko kritrim yaa galat tareeke se taiyaar karte hai
 Muslims believe that the current word of the Quran is revealed to Muhammad, and according to their interpretation of Quran 15: 9, it is protected from corruption
 muslim quran ko maardarshak maanate hai, mohammad kii bhavishyavaanee or dharm kii sachai kaa sanket
 The uniqueness of the Quran is the belief that the Quran cannot be compared to any human dialect or any material
 quran ko musalamaanon dwaara ek athulaneey chamatkaar mana jaataa he, jo yom al-qiyama ke din tak prabhavi hota he, or is prakaar, mohammad ko unke bhavishyavaaniyon kii sthiti ke pramanikaran main kendriya pramaan pradaan kiya jaataa he
 The concept of indispensability arises in the Quran, where in five different verses, opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: "if humans and jinn are bound together to produce a voice like this Quran" So they will never be able to do this, if they can support themselves with each other and see
 " to suzav yah he ki yadi quran ke divya lekhakatv se sambandhit andeh hai, to aage aaen or aisa kuch banaaen
 From the ninth century, many people and works appeared that studied the Quran and examined its style and content
 al-jurjani or al-baqillani sahit madhyayugin muslim vidwaanon ne is vishay par kai granthon ko likhaa he, iske vibhinn pahaluon par charchaa kii he, or quran kaa adhyayan karne ke liye bhashaai drushtikon kaa upyog kiya he
 Others argue that the Quran has great ideas, internal meanings, maintaining its freshness through the ages
 or quran ke zariye vyaktigat str par or itihaas main bade badlaav hue hai
 Some scholars say that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science
 quran kii chamatkarita ke siddhant par mohammad kii nirakshartaa par jor diya gaya he kyonki agyaat bhavishyadvaktaa ko quran likhane kii kshamta kaise hogi
 That is why this is the voice of God
 quran kaa pehla sura sura e fatiha dainik prarthanaaon or anya avasaron main padhaa or doharaaya jaataa he
 This sura, which consists of seven verses, is the most frequently read sura of the Quran: shuru karata hoon khuda ke naam se jo bada meharbaan nihaayat raham vaala he; sab tarif khuda hi ke liye hai zo sabaqa rab ar maaliq he; or saare jahaann kaa paalane vaala bada meharbaan raham vaala he; roze jaza kaa maalik he; kudaaya ham teri hi ibaadat karte hai or tujh hi se madad chaahate hai; to hamako sidhi raah par sabit qadam rakhwa; unki raah jinhen tuune naimat ata kii he na unki raah jin par tera gazab dhaayaa gaya or na gumraahon kii
 " quran ko anya varg bhi dainik prarthanaaon main padhate hai
 Respect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious belief by many Muslims, and the Quran is treated with respect
 parampara ke aadhaar par or quran kii ek shabdic vyakhya 56:79, kuch musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki unhen quran kii ek prati chune se pehle vazu karnaa hoga, haalanki yah vichaar nahin he saarvbhaumik

 kabhi masjid yaa ek muslim kabristaan main dafnaaya jaataa he, yaa jala diya jaataa he or raakh ko dafan kiya jaataa he yaa pani par bikharaa hua hota he
 In Islam, most intellectual disciplines, including Islamic theology, philosophy, mysticism, and jurisprudence, are concerned with the Quran or have their foundations in their teachings
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki quran ke prachaar yaa padhanaa adhik praadhanyata rakhata he
 Those who preach and study it are rewarded with divine rewards
 aisa karnaa vibhinn prakaar ke ajahar, sawab yaa hasanh kaha jaataa he
 The Quran also inspired the Islamic arts and especially the so-called Quranic arts of calligraphy and illumination
 quran ko chitrakaari chhaviyon se kabhi sajaayaa nahin jaataa he, lekin kai kuranon ko prishth ke margin main yaa linon ke bich yaa sure kii shuruyaat main sajaavati pattern ke saath sajaayaa jaataa he
