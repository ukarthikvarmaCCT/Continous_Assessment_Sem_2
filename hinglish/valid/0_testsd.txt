 Subsequently, disk pack drives that were created by IBM and other companies began being used in computers and by the 1980s it reached a capacity of 300 megabytes
 jin HDD ko computaron se hataaya nahin ja saktaa tha unhen "phixd discs" drive kaha jaataa hai
 Some high performance hdds were made with one nozzle per track such as IBM 2305 so that the time spent in moving the nozzle from one track to another could be saved
 inhen "phixd head" yaa "head par trek" discs drive kaha jaataa tha
 They were very expensive and are no longer made
 1973 main ai bi ium ne ek nae kism kii achdidi launch kii jisko "vincester" kuta naam diya gaya tha
 The primary thing in this was that the disc head did not completely separate from the platter when the power went out
 balki yah head discs ke ek khaas jagah main rukta tha tab jab discs kaa ghoomana band ho jaataa tha
 The disc head used to start with the same when restarted
 yah head pravartak pranali ke kharche ko kam karne main kargar sabit hua
 The first drives of Winchester technology had removable circular parts
 isamen discs pack or likhane va padhane vaali nok pranali hoti thi
 The promoter used to live in a wheel connected to the motor
 iske baad vaale "vincester" drivs main hathaaye ja sakane vaale discs pack ko hataa or waapas gaiyr hataane yogya discs plantres kaa istemaal hone laga
 Earlier Winchester Drives had planters with a diameter of 14 inches
 kuch saal baad is baat kii sambhaavna dhundha jane laga ki agar plantres chote hon to shaayad usase kuch or phaayde ho sakate hai
 Drives with 8-inch diameter planters followed, followed by drives with 5 1 / 4-inch diameter planters
 5 1 / 4 inch vaale drivs ko us samay main tezi se badhate hue vyaktigat computers ke bazaar ke liye roopaankit kiya gaya tha
 hdds were very expensive in the early 1980s, but by the late 1980s, their prices had reduced to such an extent that they were also used in the cheapest computers
 1980 ke dashak ke shuruyaat main zyaadaatar HDD vyaktigat computer upyogkarta ko alag se up pranali ke taur par bechaa jaataa tha
 This subsystem was sold not in the name of the drive manufacturer but in the name of the subsystem manufacturer such as Corvus Systems, Tallgrass Technologies either in the name of the manufacturer such as Apple Profile
 ai0bi0ium0 pisi / eks tii jo ai bi ium ne 1983 main launch kiya tha, main ek 10 megabite kaa andruni achdidi tha or iske baad se hi vyaktigat computers main andruni achdidi niyamit taur se istemaal hone lage
 External hdds have been used for a long time on Apple Macintosh
 1986 se 1998 ke bich bahari achdidi ko jodne ke liye harek macintosh computer main peeche ke taraf ek es si es ai port hua karata tha
 The 2011 floods in Thailand damaged many data storage plant-producing plants, causing data storage plant prices to rise between 2012-2013
 achdidi ke avishkaar ke baad nirantar tareeke se unki hawaii ghanatv main izaafaa hota rahaa he
 The data storage device consists of a thin film of ferromagnetic material which attracts the data storage device to save the data
 krambaddh tareeke se chumbakeey kshetra ke disha kaa badlaav binary data bits ko darshata he
 The change of magnetization is checked and the data is read from the disk / device
 ek kuta lekhan vidhi istemaal karke data ko sankethik shabdon main badla jaataa he
 Such as run length limited code writing method
 jo data ko chumbakeey disha ke parivartan ke anusaar prastut karata hai
 An HDD has spindles that hold a flat round disk
 plantres saadharantah gaiyr chumbakeey padaarth jaise aluminium elaay, sheesha yaa ceremic se bane hote he
 These planters are coated with magnetic material which holds the data
 is chumbakeey padaarth ke parat kii motaai 10 se 20 nanometer hoti hai or uski suraksha ke liye uske upar carbon kii ek parat bhi hoti hai
 The layer of this magnetic material is less than the thickness of the paper, which is 7 xxrep 4 0 to 18 xxrep 4 0 nanometers
 aajkal ke hard discs ke plantres ko alag alag raftaar main ghumaya jaataa hai yah vahneey yantro main 4200 ghumaav prati minutese lekar ucch pradarshan kshamta vaale sarwar main 15000 arpm tak hoti hai
 The first HDD rotated at a speed of 1200 rpm and for many years the entire HDD rotated at 3600 rpm
 disambar 2013 tak zyaadaatar upabhokataa shrenee ke achdidi 5400 arpm yaa 7200 ghumaav prati minute kii raftaar main ghoomte hai
 The information is read or written on the plotter as the platter rotates under the reed-right head
 read - rhite head or plater main duuri bahut kam hoti hai bas kuch nanometer
 Reed - Right head works to read and replace the magnetic material under it
 aadhunik achdidi main har chumbakeey plater ke upar ek read - rhite head hota hai jo kii ek samaan bhujaa se judaa hua hota hai
 a moving arm moves the head in the direction of a circle while the disc rotates so that each head reaches the entire surface of the platter
 is bhujaa ko hilaane ke liye vaayas quayal eccuater yaa kuch puraane dizine main stepper motor istemaal kiya jaataa hai
 The magnetic plate on the drive is fitted with optical insulation
 pehle ke hard discs drivs main sthir / ek hi bits par second ke tareeke se likhaa jaataa tha isliye har patari par data saamaan hota tha
 But in modern disk drives, zone bit recording is used, in which the speed of writing keeps on going from the inside to the outside track / track, it can preserve more data in the outside tracks
 aadhunik upkarnon main chumbakeey kshetra ke chote sies ke kaaran is baat kii sambhaavna hai kii vah apni chumbakeey stithi garmi ke kaaran kho saktaa hai
 This magnetic instability caused by heat is also called the "superparamagnetic limit"
 is stithi se bachane ke liye plantres ko do samanaantar chumbakeey parato se lep kiya jaataa hai inke bich ek 3 anu motaai kaa ek gairchumbakeey parat rahata hai
 Both layers have magnetic effects in the opposite direction, thus reinforcing each other
 garmi ke prabhaav se nipatane ke liye ek or takanic istemaal hoti hai iskaa naam parpendicular recording hai
 It also gives more recording density, it was first shipped in 2005
 Today many hdds are using this technology
 ek saadhaaran HDD main do vidyutiya motor hote hai
 a spindle-mounted motor that rotates the disc and an actuator motor that moves the reed / right head system over the rotating disc
 chakrika se jude hue motor main ek bahari roter hota hai jo chakrika ke saath judaa hota hai, vidyut chaalak sthaayee ghumaavdaar taar ]ek jagah sthapit hoti hai
 There is a reed-write head on the end of the rod connected to the spindle opposite the promoter
 yah likhane / padhane vaali nok bahut patale vidyutiya paripath se emplifaire electronics ke saath judaa hota hai jo pravartak ke kendra bindu par sthit hota hai
 The supporting arm of the tip is very light and solid in weight
 aadhunik upkarnon main isaki tej hone kii gati 550 g tak ho sakati hai
 The actuator is a permanent magnet
 usame ek ghoomanevaala qoil hota hai jo sahi jagah par likhane / padhane vaali nok ko chalaata hai
 a plate of metal holds a squat neodiminum-iron-borone high-speed magnet
 is thali ke neeche ek ghoomanevaala dhaatu kaa lachha hota hai jise awaz vaali qoil bhi kehete hai
 It is connected to the center of the coil promoter and below this coil is a neodiminum-iron-boron magnet
 ise motor ke ekadam nichle thali par chadha kar rakhaa jaataa hai
 The voiced coils are shaped like the tip of an arrow and are made of 2 times coated copper wire
 andar kii sataha taap rodhan ke liye hoti hai or baahar kii sataha garm plastic kii hoti hai
 The coils on either side of the tip are attached to the magnetic field
 jab vidyut pravaah ek dhaatu ke lachchhe ke andar ke disha main gaman karti hai or duusare lachchhe ke bahari disha main gaman karti hai tab ek sparsh-rekhiy dabaav utpann hota hai jo pravartak ko ghumata hai
 The electronics of the HDD control the movement of the promoter and also control the rotation or circular movement of the disc
 vah chakrika niyantrak ke nirdesho ke anusaar chakrika se soochna padhane yaa likhane kaa kaam bhi karti hai
 The feedback from the drive electronics comes from specific parts of the disc that are dedicated to servo feedback
 yah yaa to phir puri tarah se sankendrit parimandal hote hai yaa wo hisse jisame asli aankaden bikhare hue rup me hote hai
 a data storage device or hard disk operator has one or more fast rotating discs and magnetic nozzles
 inhe ek chalate hue pravartak bhujaa ke upar rakhaa jaataa hai taaki is nok kii sahaayta se chakrika ke sataha par aankadon ko likhaa yaa padhaa ja sake
 The time it takes to move the magnetic tip to the cylinder or track, along with the time it takes to rotate part of the disc under the tip and how much data is being transmitted at every moment, on the basis of these data storage device is determined Goes
 aadhunik data bhandaran yantra truti sanshodhan kuta kaa bahut istemaal karti hai khaskar read - solman truti nivaaran kuta
 This technique saves extra bits
 har data khand main kuch atirikt bits hote hai jo kuch ganit ke sutara istemaal kar galatiyon ko adrishy tareeke se sudhaarte hai
 These extra bits do take up some space in the data storage device, but it also makes it possible to have a higher write density on the data storage device, which also makes it possible to correct the errors that occur in the process
 iskaa fal yah hota hai kii data bhandaran yantra kii bhandaaran kshamta zyaada hoti hai

 Kannada is the language spoken in Karnataka state of India and the official language of Karnataka

50 karod log kannada bhashaa prayog karte hai
 According to Encarta, Kannada ranks 27th in the list of 30 most spoken languages in the world
 yah dravid bhashaa-parivaar main aati he par isamen sanskrit ke bhi bahut se shabd hai
 Kannada speaking people call it 'sirigannad'
 kannada bhashaa kaa astitv koi 2500 varsh purv se he tathaa kannada lipi kaa prayog koi 1900 varsh se ho rahaa he
 Kannada is like other Dravidian languages and Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam are similar to this language
 kannada sanskrit bhashaa se bahut prabhavit he or sanskrit ke bahut saare shabd kannada main bhi usee arth main prayukt hote hai
 The Government of India has also declared Kannada as a classical language of India
 kannada tathaa karnataka shabdon kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main bhinn-bhinn mat hai
 If a scholar is of the opinion that the word Kannada is derived from "kaniruduanadu" meaning "black clay country", then according to other scholars, "kannadu" from "kapitu Nadu" means "fragrant country" and "kannadu" from "kannadu"
 Derivation has taken place
 kannada sahitya ke itihaaskaar aar
 narsinhachaar ne is mat ko sweekaar kiya he
 Some grammars state that Kannada is a form of the Sanskrit word "karnat"
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki "karnayo atati iti karnataka" arthath jo kaanon main goonjataa he vah karnataka he
 In ancient texts, the words Kannada, Karnat, Karnataka have been used in synonyms
 mahabharat main karnat shabd kaa prayog anek baar hua he 
 In the second century Tamil poem titled "shilappadikaram", the name of the Kannada speakers is "karunadar"
 varahamihir ke brihatsamhita, somdev ke kathasaritsagar, gunanty kii pashachi "brihatkatha" aadi granthon main bhi karnat shabd kaa baraabar ullekh miltaa he
 The word 'karnataka' has become distorted in English to Carnatic or Canara, then Canarias to Canara
 uttari bharat kii hindi tathaa anya bhashaaon main kannada shabd ke liye canadee, kannadi, kenara, canari kaa prayog miltaa he
 Nowadays the words Karnataka and Kannada are used in a definite sense - Karnataka is the name of the state and "kannada" language
 dravid bhashaa parivaar kii bhashaayen panchadravid bhashaayen kehalaati hai
 At one time, these Panchadravid languages included Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati and Marathi languages
 kintu aajkal panchadravid bhashaaon ke antargat kannada, tamil, telegu, malayalam tathaa tulu maani jaati hai
 In fact, Tulu is a confirmed dialect of Kannada which is spoken in Dakshina Kannada district
 tulu ke atirikt kannada kii anya boliyaan hai–kodagu, tod, kot tathaa badug
 Kodagu is spoken in Kurg and the other three are prevalent in Nilgiri district
 nilgiri jila tamilnadu rajya ke antargat he
 Kannada was also spoken during the ramayana-mahabharata-era, even though there is no written form of Kannada before BC
 praarambhik kannada kaa likhit rup shilalekhon main miltaa he
 Among these inscriptions, the inscription found from a place called Hulmidi is the oldest, which dates to 450 AD
 saatvin shatabdi main likhe gaye shilalekhon main badaami or shravan belgol ke shilaalekh mahatvapurn hai
 Often prose is used only in pre-eighth century inscriptions and later inscriptions have excellent specimens of poetry containing poems
 in shilalekhon kii bhashaa jahaan sugathit tathaa praudh he vahaan usapar sanskrit kaa gaharaa prabhaav dikhaai detaa he
 Thus even though there is evidence of prose-poetry in Kannada based on inscriptions dating back to the 8th century, the work of writing in Kannada progressed after the name of the first available Kannada text, "kaviraj Marg", and the language continued to develop
 kannada bhashaa ke vikascram kii chaar avasthaaen maani gai hai jo is prakaar he : The four Dravidian languages have their own separate scripts

 13veen shatabdi ke purv likhe gaye telegu shilalekhon ke aadhaar par yah bataaya jaataa he ki pracheen kaal main telegu or kannada kii lipiyaan ek hi thi
 The current Kannada script looks different from the Devanagari script in terms of design, but there is not much difference between the two sound groups
 antar itnaa hi he ki kannada main swaron ke atanrgat "e" or "o" ke hrasv rup tathaa vyanjanon ke antargat vatsay "l" ke saath-saath murdhanya "l" varna bhi paae jate hai
 In ancient Kannada, "su" and "ळ" were each practiced in the form of an idolized form, but in modern Kannada, the use of these two varnas has disappeared

 Goswami Tulsidas was a great poet of Hindi literature
 inkaa janm soron shukarakshetra, vartmaan main kasganj uttar pradesh main hua tha
 Some scholars believe you were born in Rajapur district Banda
 inhen aadi kavy ramayana ke rachayita maharishi valmiki kaa avatar bhi mana jaataa he
 The story of Sriramcharitmanas is taken from Ramayana
 ramcharitamanas lok granth he or ise uttar bharat main bade bhakthibhaav se padhaa jaataa he
 After this, Vinaya Patrika is another important poem of his
 mahakavy shriramcharitamanas ko vishwa ke 100 sarvshereshth lokapriy kaavyon main 46vaan sthaan diya gaya
 Most scholars are in favor of considering Rajapur, the birth place of Tulsidas
 yadhyapi kuch ise soron shukarakshetra bhi maanate hai
 Rajapur is a village located in the Chitrakoot district of Uttar Pradesh
 vahaan atmaram dube naam ke ek pratishthit sarauparin brahman rahete the
 His wife's name was Hulasi
 sanwat 1511 ke shravan maas ke shuklapaksh kii saptami tithi ke din abhukt mul nakshatra main inhen dampati ke yahan tulsidas kaa janm hua
 According to popular folklore, the baby was extremely strong due to being in the mother's womb for twelve months and the teeth were visible in her mouth
 janm lene ke saath hi usne ram naam kaa uccharan kiya jisase uskaa naam rambola pad gaya
 Mother died on the second day of her birth
 pita ne kisi or anisht se bachane ke liye balak ko chuniyaan naam kii ek daasi ko saunp diya or swayan virakt ho gayi
 When Rambola was five and a half years old, Chuniya was also no more
 vah gali-gali bhatakta hua anathon kii tarah jivan jeene ko vivash ho gaya
 With the inspiration of Lord Shankarji, Shri Ananthanandji, a dear disciple of Shri Anantanand Ji, who lived on Ramshail, found this child who had become famous by the name of this Rambola and duly named it Tulsiram
 taduparant ve use ayodhya le gayi or vahaan sanwat 1561 magh shukla panchami ko uskaa yagyopavit-sanskaar sampann karaayaa
 At the time of the rites, even without being taught, the child Rambola pronounced Gayatri-mantra, which surprised everyone
 iske baad narhari baba ne vaishnavon ke paanch sanskaar karke balak ko ram-mantra kii diksha di or ayodhya main hi rahakar use vidyadhyayan karaayaa
 The wisdom of the child Rambola was very sharp
 vah ek hi baar main guru-mukh se jo sun letaa, use vah kanthsth ho jaataa
 From there, after some time, both the teacher and the disciple reached the sugar field
 vahaan narhari baba ne balak ko ram-katha sunaayi kintu vah use bhalee-bhanti samaj na aayi
 Jyeshtha Shukla Trayodashi, on Thursday, 1583, at the age of 29, was married to Kanya Ratnavali of the very beautiful Bharadwaja gotra, a village on the far side of the Yamuna, a little away from Rajapur
 chunki gauna nahin hua tha at: kuch samay ke liye ve kaashi chale gayi or vahaan sheshasnathan ji ke paas rahakar veda-vedang ke adhyayan main jute gayi
 While living there, suddenly one day he remembered his wife and started getting distraught
 jab nahin rahaa gaya to guruuji se ajna lekar ve apni janmabhumi rajapur laut aaye
 Since his wife Ratnavali was in the maternal house as he had not become a cowherd by then, Tulsiram swam across the sweltering Yamuna river in the dark dark night and went straight to his wife's bedroom
 ratnavali itani raat gayi apane pati ko akele aayaa dekh kar aashcharyachakit ho gayi
 When he asked them to return quietly in fear of public shame, they started urging him to go home at the same time
 unki is apratyaashit jid se khijhakar ratnavali ne swarchit ek dohe ke madhyam se jo shiksha unhen di usne hi tulsiram ko tulsidas bana diya
 The Doha that Ratnavali said was as follows: yah doha sunate hi unhone usee samay patni ko vahiin uske pita ke ghar chhod diya or waapas apane gaanv rajapur laut gayi
 On going to his house in Rajapur, when he came to know that his father was not there in his absence and the whole house was destroyed, he suffered even more
 unhone vidhi-vidhaan purvak apane pita ji kaa shraadh kiya or gaanv main hi rahakar logon ko bhagwaan ram kii katha sunaane lage
 After staying in Rajapur for some time, he again went to Kashi and started telling Ram Katha to the people there
 katha ke dauraan unhen ek din manushya ke vesh main ek pret mila, jisane unhen hanuman ji kaa pataa batalaaya
 Tulsidas, meeting Hanumanji, requested him to have darshan of Shri Raghunathji
 hanumanji ne kaha- "tumhen chitrakoot main raghunathji darshan hongen
 "on this Tulsidas ji started towards Chitrakoot
 chitrakoot pahunch kar unhone ramghat par apana asana jamaaya
 One day he went for circumambulation when suddenly in his way he saw Shri Ram
 unhone dekha ki do bade hi sundar rajkumaar ghodon par savaar hokar dhanush-baan liye ja rahe hai
 Tulsidas was attracted to see them, but could not recognize them
 tabhi peeche se hanumanji ne aakar jab unhen sara bhed bataaya to ve pashchaatap karne lage
 On this, Hanumanji consoled him and said that he would be seen again in the morning
 sanwat 1607 kii mauni amavasya ko buudhvaar ke din unke saamne bhagwaan shriram punah prakat hue
 He came as a child and said to Tulsidas - "baba! We want sandalwood, can you give us sandalwood?" Hanumanji thought, "may he not be deceived this time too, so he took the form of a parrot and said this couplet:" tulsidas shriram ji kii us adbhut chhavi ko nihaar kar apane sharir kii sud-budh hi bhul gayi
 Ultimately, God himself took the sandal from his hand and applied it on his and Tulsidas Ji's forehead and disappeared
 sanwat 1628 main vah hanuman ji kii ajna lekar ayodhya kii ore chal pade
 In those days, there was a Magh Mela in Prayag
 ve vahaan kuch din ke liye thahar gayi
 Six days after the festival, he saw Bharadwaja and Yajnavalkya Muni under a vatavriksha
 vahaan us samay vahi katha ho rahi thi, jo unhone sukarakshetra main apane guru se suni thi
 At the end of the Magh Mela, Tulsidas came back to Kashi from Prayag and resided at the house of a Brahmin at Prahladghat
 vahiin rahete hue unke andar kavitv-shakti kaa prasphuran hua or ve sanskrit main padya-rachana karne lage
 But all the verses he composed in the day, all of them would disappear in the night
 yah ghatana roj ghatati
 Tulsidas ji had a dream on the eighth day
 bhagwaan shankar ne unhen aadesh diya ki tum apni bhashaa main kavy rachana karo
 Tulsidas ji got sleepy
 ve uthakar baith gayi
 At the same time Lord Shiva and Parvati appeared to him
 tulsidas ji ne unhen sashtaang pranaam kiya
 Pleased on this, Shiva said - "you go to Ayodhya and write poetry in Hindi
 mere aashirwad se tumhaari kavita samaveda ke samaan falvati hogi
 "gaurishankar got into trouble after saying so
 tulsidas ji unki ajna shirodharya kar kaashi se sidhe ayodhya chale gayi
 The year 1631 started
 daivayog se us varsh ramanavami ke din vaisaa hi yoga aayaa jaisaa tretayug main ram-janm ke din tha
 That morning Tulsidas ji started the creation of Shri Ramcharitmanas
 do varsh, saat maheene or chhbbees din main yah adbhut granth sampann hua
 On the day of Rama's marriage in Margashirsha Shuklapaksa, in the year 1633, the seven scams were completed
 iske baad bhagwaan kii ajna se tulsidas ji kaashi chale aaye
 There he narrated Sri Ramacharitmanas to Lord Vishwanath and Mother Annapurna
 raat ko pustak vishwanath-mandir main rakh di gayi
 When the doors of the temple were opened in the morning, it was found written on the book - Satya Shivam Sundaram under which Lord Shankar was right
 us samay vahaan upasthit logon ne "satyam shivan sundaram" kii aawaaj bhi kaanon se suni
 Here, when the Pandits of Kashi came to know about this, their heart enraged
 ve dal banaakar tulsidas ji kii ninda or us pustak ko nasht karne kaa praytn karne lage
 He also sent two thieves to steal the book
 choron ne jaakar dekha ki tulsidas ji kii kuti ke aasapaas do yuvak dhanushbaan liye paharaa de rahe hai
 Both the youngsters were very beautiful, Shyam and Gaur Varna respectively
 unke darshan karte hi choron kii buddhi shuddh ho gayi
 He stopped stealing from that time and started worshiping the Lord
 tulsidas ji ne apane liye bhagavan ko ksht hua jaan kuti kaa sara samaan lutaa diya or pustak apane mitra todermal ke yahan rakhwa di
 He then wrote another copy with his unique memory
 usee ke aadhaar par duusari pratilipiyaan taiyaar kii gayin or pustak kaa prachaar dinon-din badhane laga
 Here the Pandits of Kashi, seeing no other remedy, prayed to the Mahapandit named Shri Madhusudan Saraswati to give his consent after seeing that book
 madhusudan saraswati ji ne use dekhakar badi prasannataa prakat kii or us par apni ore se yah tippanee likh di- Its meaning in Hindi is as follows - "tulsidas is a walking and moving plant of Tulsi in the joy-forest of Kashi
 uski kavy-manjari badi hi manohar he, jis par shriram rupi bhanvaraa sadaa mandraata rahata he
 " panditon ko unki is tippanee par bhi santosh nahin hua
 Then another way of examining the book was thought of
 kaashi ke vishwanath-mandir main bhagavan vishwanath ke saamne sabase upar veda, unke neeche shaastra, shastron ke neeche puraana or sabake neeche ramcharitamanas rakh diya gaya
 When the temple was opened in the morning, people saw that Sri Ramacharitmanas was placed on the Vedas
 ab to sabhi pandit bade lajjit hue
 He apologized to Tulsidas ji and took his footsteps with devotion
 tulsidas ji jab kaashi ke vikhyat ghat asighat par rahane lage to ek raat kaliyug moort rup dhaaran kar unke paas aayaa or unhen pidaa pahunchaane laga
 Tulsidas ji meditated on Hanuman ji at the same time
 hanuman ji ne saakshaat prakat hokar unhen prarthana ke pad rachane ko kaha, iske pashchaat unhone apni antim kriti vinay-patrika likhi or use bhagwaan ke charnon main samarpit kar diya
 Shri Ram ji himself signed it and made Tulsidas ji fearless
 sanwat 1680 main shravan krishna tritiya shanivaar ko tulsidas ji ne "ram-ram" kehete hue apana sharir parityag kiya
 Tulsidas ji's handwriting was highly beautiful as it was the art of calography in that era
 unke janm-sthaan rajapur ke ek mandir main shriramcharitamanas ke ayodhyakand kii ek prati surakshit rakhi hui he
 The following two verses were also published by Indraprastha Bharati, a magazine of Hindi Academy Delhi, outlining the personality and gratitude of Tulsi in the manuscript of Madanlal Varma 'krant', a poet with the same copy
 inamen pehla chand simhavlokan he jisaki visheshta yah he ki prayek charan jis shabd se samaapt hota he usase aage kaa usee se praranbh hota he
 The first and last words also remain the same
 kavyashastra main ise adbhut chand kaha gaya he
 The same verses were also published in the Tulsi Jayanti special issue of Sahityaprikaprama, another magazine
 apane 126 varsh ke deergh jivan-kaal main tulsidas ne kalkrmanusaar nimnlikhit kaaljayi granthon kii rachanaayen kin - Of these, the praise of a poet seems to be accurate in the works of Ramcharitmanas, Vinaya Patrika, Kavitavali, Geetavali - Pasya Devasya Poetry, Neither Mrnoti nor Jeerati
 arthath devpurushon kaa kavy dekhiye jo na marataa na purana hota he
 About four hundred years ago Tulsidas ji composed his creations
 aadhunik prakaashan-suvidhaon se rahit us kaal main bhi tulsidas kaa kavy jan-jan tak pahunch chukaa tha
 This is a direct proof of his popularization as a poet
 maanas jaise vrihad granth ko kanthsth karke saamaanya padhe likhe log bhi apni shuchita evam gyaan ke liye prasiddh hone lage the
 Ramcharitmanas has been the most popular text of Tulsidas ji
 unhone apni rachanaaon ke sambandh main kahin koi ullekh nahin kiya he, isliye pramanik rachanaaon ke sambandh main ant:sakshya kaa abhaav dikhaayi detaa he
 The books published by Nagari Pracharini Sabha Kashi are as follows: 'encychlopedia of religen and athiks' main grearsan ne bhi uparokt pratham baarah granthon kaa ullekh kiya he
 This is a rite of passage
 is geet main katipay ullekh ram-vivaah kii katha se bhinn hai
 Vairagya Sandipani is considered unnatural by Mata Prasad Gupta, but Acharya Chandrawali Pandey considers it authentic and an early creation of Tulsi
 kuch or pracheen pratiyon ke uplabdh hone se thos pramaan mil sakate hai
 The first Sorta of Saint Mahima's description is - vidwaanon ne ise tulsi kii rachana ghoshit kiya he
 In terms of style, it is an authentic creation of Tulsidas
 isaki khandit prati hi granthawali main sampadit he
 It appears to be an authentic creation of Tulsi
 isaki kaavyatmak praudhata tulsi siddhant ke anukool he
 The poem is simple, comprehensively interesting and succulent
 ""jagat maatu pitu sambhu bhavani"" kii shringaarik cheshtaaon kaa tanik bhi put nahin he
 The folk tradition is so status quo that it is less influenced by Sanskrit poetry of Sanskrit, and Tulsi's narrative narrative on the devotional role of Mati
 vyavhaaron kii sushthuta, prem kii ananyta or vaivaahik kaarykram kii sarasata ko badi saavdhaanee se kavi ne ankit kiya he
 Tulsidas was very satisfied with his creation, that is why this unhappy devotee has praised his mother only once - vidwaanon ne ise tulsidas kii pramanik rachanaaon main sthaan diya he
 But it also has intercept
 tulsi ke maanas ke purv valmikiy ramayana kii katha hi lok prachlit thi
 Tulsidas's differences with the pandits of Kashi about Tulsidas and Vishwanath's signature on the copy of Manas are famous
 yah jyotish shastreey paddati kaa granth he
 Divided into couplets, saptakas and cantos, this book is a mixed composition of various Mars and amalgamous episodes of Ramakatha
 kavy kii drushti se is granth kaa mahatva naganya he
 All consider it to be tulsified
 isamen katha-shrinkhalaa kaa abhaav he or valmikiy ramayana ke prasangon kaa anuwaad anek dohon main he
 Most of the couplets in Dohavali are of Manas
 kavi ne chatak ke vyaaj se dohon kii ek lambii shrinkhalaa likhakar bhakthi or prem kii vyakhya kii he
 Dohavali is a Doha collection
 maanas ke bhi kuch katha nirpeksh dohon ko isamen sthaan he
 It is possible that some couplets will also be projected in it, but the opaqueness of the composition is unquestionable
 kavitawali tulsidas kii rachana he, par sabha sanskaran athwa anya sanskarnon main prakashit yah rachana puri nahin prathit hoti he
 Kavitavali is a management work
 kathanak main apraasangikta evam shithilataa tulsi kii kala kaa kalank kaha jaayegaa
 The basis of the songs in Gitavali has been Ramcharit of various scandal
 yah granth ramcharitamanas kii tarah vyapak jansampark main kam gaya prathit hota he
 Hence the changes in these songs are not visible
 gitavali main geeton ke katha - sandarbh tulsi kii mati ke anuroop hai
 From this point of view a song of Geetavali can be taken - isamen bharat or ram ke sheel kaa utkarsh tulsidas ne vyakt kiya he
 The Uttarakand of Geethavali has more detail than the story of Manas
 isamen sita kaa valmiki ashram main bheja janaa varnit he
 The justification for this abandonment is found in these lines - shrikrishna gitavali bhi goswamiji kii rachana he
 Certain episodes of Shri krishna-katha are the subject of songs
 yah goswami ji kii hanumat-bhakthi sambandhi rachana he
 But this is an independent work
 iske sabhi ansh pramanik prathit hote hai
 Tulsidas loved Rama, the story of Rama was lovely, Rama was cute and Rama was cute
