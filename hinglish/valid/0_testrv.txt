 O! say can you see by the dawn’s early light,what so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,o’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?and the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;o! say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,o’er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream: 'tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it waveo'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
 And where is that band who so vauntingly sworethat the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion,a home and a country, should leave us no more?their blood has washed out their foul footsteps’ pollution
no refuge could save the hireling and slavefrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:and the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,o’er the land of the free and the home of the brave
 O! Thus be it ever, when freemen shall standbetween their loved home and the war's desolation
blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued landpraise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation! Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: "in God is our trust;" And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall waveo'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! oh, mujhe bataao, tum bhor ke prakaash main dekh sakate ho,ham kitne garv se suryaast ke samay pichhali chamak kaa swaagat karte the,jisaki chaudee pattiyaan or chamakdaar sitare ko khatarnaak ladaai ke samay,pracheer ke sheersh par ham nazar rakhte the, wo kitni bahaduree se laharaata tha?or rocket kii laal chamak, hawa main foot rahe bamaraat ke madhyam se ye pramaani dete he ki hamaara dhvaj abhi bhi vahaan tha;oh, bataao ki kya sitar-susajjit dhvaj abhi bhi laharaa rahaa he,swatantra logon kii bhoomi or vir logon ke gharon par? Hidden in the deep fog on the coast, where the egoistic army of enemies has fallen into fear, Qu'est-ce que cette brise intermittente, le long du versant, Nous dévoile et nous cache? à présent elle capture l'éclat du premier rayon de soleil, Nous le renvoie dans toute sa gloire, maintenant elle brille dans le ventc'est la bannière étoilée! Oh puisse-t-elle longtemps flottersur la terre de la Liberté et la patrie des braves
 or kahan he wo band jo shekhi maarthe hue kasam khate hamedue les foudres de la guerre et la désolation des combatsne nous laisseraient ni terre ni patrie !leur sang a purifié la terre qu'ils ont foulée

 On the last day of the month, when there was no sound for many days, the king eagerly peeped into the room and the old artisan came out by opening the door and told the king that the idols were still incomplete, his hands were not yet made
 raja ke afsos karne par, murtikar ne bataaya, ki yah sab daivavash hua he or yah murtiyon aise hi sthapit hokar puji jaayengin

 'vikaas' or 'sanvruddhi' ke pratyayon main spasht antar karne vaale is arthshaastra ko vaikasik yaa vikasvaadi ke bajaay aarthik sanvruddhi ke arthshaastra ke rup main pesh karne par jor dete hai
 William Petty's mercantilism and Adam Smith's classical economics have its earliest glimpse
 attharahavin sadi main smith or unke saathiyon ne aarthik vruddhi kii prakriya ko maanav itihaas ke vibhinn charnon ke zariye samajhane kii koshish kii thi
 According to this, the primitive stage was the primitive condition which developed in nomadic animal husbandry
 tisare charan main kheti ke aadhaar par aarthik sambandh bane or ant main vaanijya or kaarkaanaa utpaadan kii prakriyaayein saamne aayin
 It is obvious that formulas of developmental economics are tried only in developing countries
 vishwa arthvyavastha main in deshon ko ek ‘special cese’ ke taur par dekhte hue aksar mana jaataa he ki inaki samasyaayen mote taur par ek si hai
 Initially, the low per capita GDP of these countries was considered synonymous with their underdevelopment
 baad main mahasoos kiya gaya ki kheti se hone vaala kaafii utpaada bazaar main jane ke bajaay kisaanon dwaara apane istemaal main karch kar liya jaataa he isliye jidipi naapane kii vidhiyaan rashtriya aamadani kaa sahi-sahi anumaan nahin laga paatin
 As a result, the method of supplementary estimation was adopted for accurate estimation of the income of these countries
 alpavikas ke shikaar adhiktar desh asia or africa main paye jate hai
 Apart from low GDP, underdevelopment means poor infrastructure facilities in the form of roads, schools and hospitals
 in deshon kii raajnneetik or aarthik sansthagat sanrachana bhi bahut kamazor he
 The lack of democracy and the shortcomings of banking and corporate infrastructure have made their economic growth more difficult
 aabaadi kaa bahut kam pratishat sakshar he or is lihaaz se ye desh maanviya poonji ke lihaaz se bhi daridr hai
 The writing on developmental economics discusses the urge to adopt a strategy of balanced growth, the poles that propagate growth, and the policies that catalyze growth
 lekin, is arthshaastra ne arthvyavastha main rajya kii sanstha ke hastkshep ke sawaal par kaasi bahes ko bhi janm diya he
 Advocates of neoclassical economics believe that developing countries will automatically get the capital they need due to the low cost of production in those countries
 isliye sarkaron ko aarthik jivan main hastkshep karne kii pareshaani main nahin fasana chahie
 a prominent proponent of non-interventionist policies, Peter Bauer, cited the positive aspects of traditional practices adopted in the West African and Asian economies, claiming that the bureaucratic interference of governments in economic matters adversely affected the development of these countries

 All these scholars have made a special contribution to some aspect of this branch of economic science

 Accordingly, a part of the economy of these countries is made up of big cities, industries, services and international commerce

 Gunnar Myrdal, by adopting an economic and sociopolitical attitude, has analyzed the Ashiyai Vaikasik problems and has also highlighted the problem of corruption
 raul prebeesh ne sthaneey udyog or anya utpaadan ko sangrakshit karne vaali nitiyon par gaur karte hue alpaviksit deshon ke liye aayaat-pratisthaapan kii nitiyon kii sifaarish kii he taaki ve apni vyapaar kii sharton main sudhaar kar saken
 Prabish has also stressed the need for long-term loans to prevent all-round decline in the condition of poor countries
 rogenstein-rodaan ne suzav diya he ki garib deshon ko udyogikaran se hone vaale uttarottar badhane vaali aamadani se laabh uthaane kii koshish kerani chahie
 The Mint has linked economic growth with international commerce and Singer has suggested balanced growth
 amartya sen ne kshamtaaon kii samanta hasil karne kaa vichaar diya he
 They insist on equalizing the capabilities of the people rather than on the parity of income or resources
 amartya sen ke mutabik agar saamaajik niti is tarah banaayi jaae ki uske aadhaar par log vibhinn kaam karne laayak kshamtaayen viksit kar saken to samta kaa adarsh praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, if there is illiteracy in an area, it will be sufficient for those who believe in resource parity to spend on available resources, books and education related services
 par, kshamtaaon kii samta ke pairokaar chahenge ki logon ke bheetar shiksha naamak ek aantarik yogyata paidaa karne ke upaay kiye jaaen
 Amartya Sen wants human diversity to be taken care of closely while analyzing inequality
 yah vividhta aantarik bhi hoti he or bahya bhi
 For example, although every woman is a victim of gender discrimination, the circumstances of a Dalit woman and a woman belonging to an upper caste can be quite different
 isi tarah nayi dilli kii ek dalit stri or rajasthan yaa haryana kii kisi savarna vidhwaa kii jivan-sthitiyon ke bich fark kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie
 If social policies are made by considering these differences, then the parity of capabilities can be achieved better
 karl marks dwaara pravartit samrajyavad ke siddhant se prerana lekar andre gundar frank dwaara nirbharta ke siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 This establishment has brought about a radical change in developmental economics
 frank kii manyata he ki duniya ke paimaane par poonjeewaad viksit deshon dwaara teesri duniya ke deshon ke dohan ke aadhaar par chal rahaa he
 Through technology and market control, these countries sitting at the center of the world economy are drawing extra value from the marginalized poor countries
 vaikasik arthshaastra se judi ek or bahes vikaas kii seemaa or lakshya ko lekar bhi he
 Considering the damage done to the environment and ecology due to flawed assessment and forward-looking lack of forward-looking policies, the Brandland Report in 1987 introduced the concept of sustainable development so that existing needs can be aligned with future needs

 This information is often filed as a complaint to the police by the victim of the crime
 kisi aparaadh ke bare main police ko koi bhi vyakti maukhik yaa likhit rup main suchit kar saktaa he
 The FIR is a document prepared by the police, in which the information of crime is described
 Generally, this is the first step necessary before the police can start crime related research

 apwaad, jo aksar nae khilaadiyon ko bhram main daal detaa he ki yugal court kii sarv-lambaai aayam chota hota he
 The entire width of the court is 6
1 meters and the width of a single is 5
18 meters
 court kii puri lambaai 13
4 meter hoti he
 Service courts are marked by dividing the width of the court by a middle line
 net se 1
98 meter kii duuri par short sarvice rekha dwaara or bahari ore tathaa pichhali simaaon dwaara yah chihnit hota he
 In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0
78 meters from the rear boundary
 net kinaaron par 1
55 meter or bich main 1
524 meter ooncha hota he
 Poles in the net stand on the doubles, even when the singles are played
 badminton ke niyamon main court ke upar kii chat kii nunatam oonchai kaa koi ullekh nahin he
 Nevertheless, such a badminton court would not be considered good if the elevated serve touches the roof
 niyam nirdisht karata he ki koun-sa upkaran istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In particular, the rules regarding the design and shape of rackets and shuttlecocks are limited
 sahi gati ke liye shatalkock ke pareekshan kaa bhi niyam main praavdhaan hai: 3
1: Use a full underhand stroke to check the shuttlecock that takes the shuttlecock to the rear boundary line
 shatalkock ko ek upree kone par or samanaantar disha main said line kii ore maarna chahie
 3
2: a shuttlecock of the correct speed shall not fall at least 530 mm and more than 990 mm away from the other rear boundary line
 har khel 21 point par khelaa jaataa he, jahaan khilaadi ek raily jeet kar ek point score karata he 
 The best is a match in three games
 raily ke aarambh main, sarwar or resiver apane-apane sarvice court main ek-duusare ke tirchhe khadey hote hai 
 The server hits the shuttlecock in such a way that it falls into the receiver's service court
 This is similar to tennis, except that the badminton serve must be hit from below waist height and the racket shaft must be downward, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, and in badminton players have to stand inside their serve courts , Whereas this does not happen in tennis
 jab serving paksh ek raily haar jaataa he, tab sarv pratidwandvi yaa pratidwandviyon ko mil jaaya karata he 
 In singles, the server scores even if it stands in his right service court and his left service court when his score is odd
 yugal main, agar serving paksh ek raily jeet jaataa he, to vahi khilaadi sarv karnaa jari rakhata he, lekin use sarvice court badalanaa padataa he taaki vah baari-baari se harek pratidwandvi ke liye kaary karata he
 If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even, then the player on the right service court serves; If odd, the player from the left service court serves
 pichhali raily ke aarambh main unki jagah ke aadhaar par hi khiladiyon ke sarvice court nirdhaarit hote hai, na ki raily ke ant main jahaan ve khadey the
 One consequence of this system is that every time a side gets a chance to serve, a player gets the opportunity to become a server who did not serve the last time
 jab sarwar sarv karata he, tab shatalkock virodhiyon ke court main short sarvice line ke paar janaa chahie varanaa ise chook maan liya jayega
 If the score has reached 20-all, the game continues until one side takes a two-point lead, a maximum of 30 points
 match ke aarambh main, ek sikaa uchhaala jaataa he
 Winners in this can decide whether they will serve or receive first, or which side of the court they would like to play before
 His opponents have to choose only the leftovers
 kam aupchaarik settings main, sikaa oochhaalane ke bajaay aksar hi ek shatalkock ko hit karke upar hawa main udaaya jaataa he, cork kaa sira jis ore ingit karata he wo paksh sarv karegaa
 In the subsequent game, the winner of the previous game serves first
 inhen rabers bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 If a team wins a game then they play once again and if they win once again, they win that match only, but if they lose then they have to win a match And have to play matches
 kisi bhi yugal khel kii pehali raily ke liye, serving jodi faisla kar sakati he ki koun pehle sarv karegaa or risiving jodi faisla kar sakati he ki koun pehle risive karegaa
 At the beginning of the second game, players have to change their ends; If the match reaches the third game, they have to change their ends twice at the start of the game and then when the leading pair's score reaches 11 points
 sarwar or resiver ko seemaa rekha chhue bina apane sarvice court main rahanaa padataa he, jab tak ki sarwar shatalkock ko strike nahin karata
 anya do khilaadi apni ichha anusaar kahin bhi khadey rah sakate hai, tab tak jab tak ki ve virdohi sarwar yaa resiver kii nazar se dur hai
 Players win a rally by striking the shuttlecock and dropping it inside the opposing court's court boundary)
 khilaadi tab bhi ek raily jeet jaataa he jab virdohi koi galati karata he
 The most common mistake or fault in badminton is when the player fails to send the shuttlecock back and falls on the opposing court, but there are other ways players can be at fault
 kai galtiyaan vishesh rup se sarvice se sambandhit hai
 It will be the fault of the serving player if the shuttlecock is above his waist at the time of contact, or the head of his racket is not down at the time of impact
 yah vishesh niyam 2006 main sanshodhit hua: pehle, sarwar ke racket ko is had tak adhomukhi hona hota tha ki racket ke sir ko us haath se neeche rahanaa jaruri tha jisase racket ko pakadaa gaya he; or ab, samastar ke neeche koi bhi kone sweekaarya he
 Neither the server nor the receiver can lift one leg until the server strikes the shuttlecock
 The server will also initially have to hit the base of the shuttlecock, although it can later hit the winged part as part of the same stroke
 es-sarv yaa sidek sarv ke naam se khyath ek atyant prabhavi sarvice style ko pratibandhit karne ke liye yah kaanoon banaaya gaya
 Through this style, servers used to create disorganized spin in shuttlecock flights
 net ke paar waapas bhejne ke pehle har paksh shatalkock ko sirf ek hi baar strike kar saktaa he; lekin ek ekal stroke sanchalan ke dauraan koi khilaadi shatalkock ko do baar sampark kar saktaa he 
 However, a player cannot hit the shuttlecock once with a new move again, or he cannot hold or sling the shuttlecock
 agar shatalkock chat ko hit karata he to yah folt hoga
 If the lats occur, the rally is stopped and played again without any change in score
 kuch anpekshit baadha ke kaaran lats ho sakate hai, masalan shatalkock ke court main gir jane par yaa chote haul ke upree bhaag se shatal chhu jaae to ise lats kaha ja saktaa he
 If the receiver is not ready when served, it will be called Let's; However, if the receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, it will be presumed ready
 agar shatalkock tepe ko hit karata he to vah lats nahin hoga | Badminton rackets are light, good quality racquets weigh between 79 and 91 grams with wire
 ye kai alag samagriyon carbon fibre mishran se lekar thos ispaat tak, vibhinn tarah ke padaarthon ke sanvardhan se banaaye ja sakate hai
 Carbon fiber provides an excellent strength to weight ratio, which is stiff and provides excellent transfer of kinetic energy
 carbon fibre mishran se pehle, racket halake dhaatuon jaise aluminium main banataa tha
 Earlier rackets were made of wood
 saste racket ab bhi aksar ispaat jaise dhaatu ke banate hai, lekin atyadhik maatra main lakdi lagane or isaki keemat ke kaaran ab saamaanya bazaar ke liye lakdi ke racket nahin banate hai
 Nowadays, nano materials such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes are also being incorporated into rackets to provide greater durability
 racket dizin main bahut sari vividhtaayen hai, haalanki niyaman racket kaa sies or uske aakaar kii seemaa tay kar di gayi he
 Different players have different types of rackets to design the game
 paaramparik upree hissaa andakaar vaale racket abhi bhi uplabdh hai, lekin ek sammatrik aakaar kaa racket tezi se aam ho rahaa he
 They are very popular with most players
 badminton taar patale hote hai, bahut achche pradarshan vaale taar 0
65 se 0
73 mimi motaai kii range main hote hai
 Thicker strings are more durable, but most players prefer thinner strings
 taar kaa kasaav aamtaur par 80 se 130 n main hota he
 Hobbyist players usually have less tightness than professional, especially between 18 and 25 lb-force
 peshewar ke taar kaa kasaav lagbhag 25 or 36 pound-bal ke bich
 It is often argued that wire tightening improves control, while lower tension increases strength
 iske liye jo yukti di jaati he vah aamtaur kachche yantric tark ke taur par lagu hote hai, jaise ki kam kasaavvaale taar kaa aadhaar adhik oochaal dene vaala hota he or isliye adhik shakti pradaan karata he
 This is incorrect, in fact, due to a high tension wire the shuttle can slip through the racket and therefore it is difficult to hit the shot properly
 ek vikalp yah sujhata he ki takat ke liye sarvottam kasaav khilaadi par nirbhar karata he: sarvaadhik takat ke liye ucch kasaav se khilaadi apane racket ko adhik tezi se or adhik sateek taur par laharaa saktaa he
 Neither rigorous mechanical analysis is needed for any idea nor is there clear evidence in favor of it or the other
 ek khilaadi ke liye sabase prabhavi tarika he ki ek achche kasaavvaale taar kaa vah prayog kare
 The choice of grip or grip allows the player to increase the thickness of their racket fixture and choose a comfortable surface for grip
 antim parat chadhaane se pehle khilaadi ek yaa anek grip ke saath racket kaa muttha taiyaar kar saktaa he
 Players can choose between different types of grip material
 zyaadaatar PU synthetic grip yaa toweyling grip kaa hi chalan he
 The choice of grip is a matter of personal preference
 aksar khiladiyon ke liye pasinaa ek samasya he; is maamle main, grip yaa haath main ek drawing agent lagaaya ja saktaa he, sweatbands kaa istemaal ho saktaa he, khilaadi duusare kism kaa grip material chun saktaa he yaa grip ko baar-baar badal saktaa he
 There are two main types of grip: replacement grips and overgrips
 Replacement grips are thicker and are often used to increase the size of the pimples
 overgrips patale hote hai or aksar iskaa istemaal antim parat ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 However, many players prefer to use a replacement grip as the final layer
 toweyling grip hameshaa riplacement grip hote hai
 Replacement grips are adhesives, while overgrips are only small patches of adhesive at the beginning of the tape and must be applied based on tightness; Overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, as they can quickly replace the underlying content without spoiling
 shatalkock ek khulaa shanku aakaar kaa ooncha udanevaala prakshepya he: cork ke aadhaar main solah ativyapee antahsthapit pankhons se shanku banaaya jaataa he
 The cork is covered with fine leather or synthetic material
 chunki pankhons ke shatal aasaani se tut jate hai, isiilie aksar shaukia khilaadiyon dwaara apni laagat ko kam karne ke liye synthetic shatal kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 These nylon shuttles are made with either a natural cork or artificial foam base and plastic enclosure
 iske atirikt, nylon shatalkock teen kismon ke hote hai, harek kism alag tarah ke taapmaana ke liye hote hai
 They are of three types; For green, blue and red
 isliye cork ke chaaron taraf chipki rangeen pattee rang or gati kii ore sanket karti he
 Faster shuttles are used in colder temperatures and slower ones are chosen in warmer climates
 badminton juute vajan main halake rabar ke tale yaa milte-julate hai grip ke saath non-marking saamagree se bane hote hai
 Compared to running shoes, badminton shoes are slightly lateral recumbent
 ucch str kaa parshvik avlamban gatividhiyon ke liye vahaan upyogi he, jahaan parshv gati avaanchhneeya or apratyaashit he
 Nonetheless, badminton requires powerful lateral movements
 badminton main pair kii suraksha main ek ucch nirmit parshvik avlamban sakasham nahin hoga, iske bajaae, aisi jagah par jahaan juute ko avlamban nahin mil paata yah vipattijanak rup se girane kaa sabab ban jayega or khilaadi ke takhne achaanak bhaar ke liye taiyaar na hon to yah moch kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 For this reason, badminton players should opt for badminton shoes over general trainee or runner shoes, as exact badminton shoes have a very thin bottom, lowering a person's center of gravity and therefore less scope for injury
 it occurs
 har tarah ke dhakke main khilaadiyon ko surakshit or uchit kadamon ke upyog ke saath ghutane or pairon ke sanrekhan ko bhi sunishchit karnaa chahie
 This is not only a concern for safety, it is also important to use appropriate steps to maintain speed in the court
 badminton main bahut saare buniyadi stroke hai or prabhavi dhang se pradarshan ke liye khilaadiyon ko bahut hi ucch str ke kaushal kii aavashyaktaa he
 All strokes can be played with either forehand or backhand
 ek khilaadi kaa forehand said uske khilne vaale haath kaa hi said hota he: daaen haath ke khilaadi ke liye forehand said uskaa dahinaa said hota he or bacand said uskaa baayan said hota he
 The forehand stroke from the dominant palm is struck from the front of the right hand, while the backhand stroke is struck from the back of the right hand
 khilaadi aksar forehand said kii ore se bacand maarane ke saath kuch stroke khelte hai or iskaa ulta bhi
 In the front court and middle court, most strokes can be played in the same effective manner, either from the forehand or backhand side; But from the back of the court the player attempts to play as many strokes as possible from his forehand, often preferring to play forehand overhead rather than backhand overhead
 ek bacand overhead khilne ke do mukhya nuksaan hai
 First of all, the player must turn his back towards his opponents, which makes him unable to see them and the court
 duusare, bacand overheads utani takat ke saath nahin maaraa ja saktaa jitna ki forehand: kandhe ke jod ke kaaran maarane kii karrwai simit ho jaati he, jo bacand ke bajaae forehand overhead sanchaalan ke bahut bade range kii anumati detaa he
 Most players and coaches in the game consider the backhand clear to be a hard basic stroke, as precise technique is required in order to muster enough power to travel the entire length of the shuttlecock court
 usee kaaran se, bacand smash kamjor ho jate hai
 The choice of stroke depends on how close the shuttlecock is to the net, whether it is above the height of the net, and where the opponent's current position is: if they can reach the shuttlecock above the height of the net, players are better off
 Occur in the event of an attack
 forcourt main, ek ooncha shatalkock net kil se milegaa, ise neeche kii ore tezi se hit karte hue raily ko turant jeetne kii koshish kii jaaegi
 isi kaaran yah behatar he ki is sthiti main shatalkock ko net par hi girane diya jaae
 midcourt main, ooncha shatalkock aamtaur par ek shaktishaalee smash bana diya jaataa he, yah neeche kii ore hit karata he or isse ek sampurna jeet yaa ek kamjor jawaab kii ummid kii jaati he
 The gymnastic jump smash, where the player jumps upward for a downward smash angle, is a common and spectacular element of the elite men's doubles game
 rurcourt main, shatalkock ko neeche kii ore aane dene ke bajaae khiladi us samay maarane ke liye bekaraar hota he jab vah unke upar hota he
 This overhead stroke allows them to play a variety of smashes, clears, and dropshots
 agar shatalkock thoda neeche aata he, to smash asambhav he or sampurna lambaai, ooncha clear mushkil he
 When the shuttlecock is well below the height of the net, players have no choice but to hit upwards
 lifts jahaan virodhiyon ke court ke peeche le jane ke liye shatalkock upar kii taraf maaraa jaataa he, court ke kisi bhi hisse se khelaa ja saktaa he
 If the player does not lift, he is left with the option of gently moving the shuttlecock to the net: in the four courts it is called net short, in mid-court it is often called push or block
 jab shatalkock net kii oonchai ke kareeb hota he, khilaadi drivs hit kar sakate hai, joki sapaat or virodhiyon ke midcourt tathaa rear court main tezi se net ke upar se jaataa he
 The push may hit even more flat, moving the shuttlecock in front of the midcourt
 drivs or push midcourt yaa forcourt se khele ja sakate hai or iskaa upyog aksar dubles main hota he: aisa ve shatalkock ko lift karne yaa smash se bachaav kii koshish ke bajaae ve hamale ko phir se praapt karne ke liye karte hai
 After a successful push or drives, opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock
 smash se bachaav karne ke dauraan, khilaadi ke paas teen buniyadi vikalp hote hai : lift, block, yaa drive
 ekal main, net main block bahut hi saamaanya javaabi kaarywahi he
 In doubles, a lift is the safest option, but it usually allows the opponents to consistently smash; Block and drive are combat strokes, but can be intercepted by the smash partner
 bahut saare khilaadi donon forehand or bacand said main smash ko lautaane ke liye bankehand hit karte hai, kyonki sidhe sharir par aate hue smash ke liye forehand ke bajaae bacand kahin adhik prabhavi hota he
 The service is restricted by rule and it offers arrays to choose their own type of stroke
 tennis ke vipareet, sarwar kaa racket sarv dene ke dauraan neeche kii disha main nishaanaa sadhate hue hona chahie saamanyatya shatal upar kii ore maaraa janaa chahie taaki vah net par se gujaarey
 sarwar forcourt main lo sarv kaa, yaa sarvice court ke peeche main lift kaa, yaa ek sapaat drive sarv kaa chunaav kar saktaa he
 The lift serve must be either a high serve, where the shuttlecock rises so high that it falls behind the court in an almost steep direction, or a fly serve, where the shuttlecock rises to a lower altitude but collapses soon
 ek baar khiladi ko in buniyadi stroke main maharath hasil kar lete hai, tab ve shatalkock ko court ke kisi bhi hisse main puri takat se or dhire se jaisaa jaruri ho, hit ke sakate hai
 In addition to the basics, however, badminton offers good potential for advanced stroke applying skills that give a competitive advantage
 kyonki badminton khilaadiyon ko jaldi se jaldi ho sake kam se kam duuri ko tay karnaa padataa he, iskaa uddeshy virodi ko kai bahut hi unnat stroke dena hota he, taaki yaa to vah is chaal main pad jaae ki ek alag stroke khelaa gaya he, yaa vah sahi myne main shatal kii disha dekhne tak apni gati dhimaa karne ko majaboor ho jaae
 badminton main aksar in donon tareeke se "chalbaaji" kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 When the player actually does the trick, often he will lose the same point because he cannot change his direction so quickly to reach the shuttlecock
 Experienced players will be mindful of the move and will be conscious of making the move very soon, but trick attempts are still useful, as it forces the opponent to slow down their pace
 kamjor khilaadi jo stroke maaranevaala hota he, anbhavi khilaadi us stroke se laabh uthaane ke makasad se uske shatalkock ko hit karne se pehle hi chal padataa he
 Slicing and shothanded hitting action are two main technical tools that facilitate trickery
 slising shatalkock ko racket ke saamne kii ore se kone banaate hue maarane se sambandhit he, jisase yah sharir or baajuon dwaara sujhaaye gayi sanchalan ke bajaae alag disha main jaataa he
 Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to be much slower than the speed shown by the arms
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek acha crosscourt sliced dropshort jo shatalkock kii kshamta or disha donon hi virdohi ko thagte hue jor se maarane kii kaarywahi kaa upyog karegaa jo sidhe clear yaa smash hota he
 a very sophisticated slicing operation involves brushing the wire around it to rotate the shuttlecock when it hits
 iskaa istemaal net se hokar bahut hi tezi se guzarate hue gaharaai main le jate hue shatal ke prakshep path main vruddhi karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he; udhaaharan ke liye, sliced lo sarv saamaanya lo sarv kii tulana main thodaa jaldi yatra kar saktaa he, phir bhi usee jagah girtaa he
 The shuttlecock also creates a spinning netshort in which the shuttlecock rotates several times before stabilizing; Sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of rolling
 spinning netshort kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki jab tak shatalkock kaa ludhakna band nahin ho jaataa he virdohi use lenaa nahin chahega, kyonki pankhon main maarane kaa nateeja apratyaashit stroke hota he
 Spinning netshots are of special importance for a high level solo player
 aadhunik racket kaa halkaapan khilaadi ko kai stroke ke liye aakhri sambhavit kshan tak shaktishaalee yaa halkaa stroke maarane ke vikalp ko banaaye rakhane ke liye short hiting karrwai ke istemaal karne kii anumati detaa he
 For example, a single player may hold his racket for a netshort, but then flick the shuttlecock back instead of a shallow lift
 isse bade hit se lift karne ke bajaae puure court ko cover karte hue swing karana virdohi ke liye kathin kaam hota he
 a short hitting action is not useful for trickery: it allows the player to hit powerful strokes when there is no time for a large arm swing
 aise takneekon main majboot grip bahut myne rakhata he or ise aksar finger power ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 Elite players develop finger power to an extent so that they can hit some powerful strokes, such as net kills by swinging the racket less than 10 cm
 soft stroke khilne ke liye hiting karrwai ke dhime ho jane se pehle shaktishaalee stroke ke dwaara chalbaasike is style ko ulat dena bhi sambhav he
 The rear style of trickery is generally common in the rearcourt, while the latter style is very common in the forecourt and midcourt
 chalbaazi slising or short hiting karrwai tak simit nahin he
 The player may also use double motion where the racquet is initially operated in one direction before saving the racket from hitting in the other direction
 aamtaur par yah crosscourt kone ke istemaal kaa suzav detaa he, lekin stroke ko sidhaa yaa iske ulat kheltaa he
 Triple motion is also possible, but it is very rare in real sports
 racket ke upree hisse kaa nakli istemaal dabl moshan kaa ek vikalp he, jahaan praarambhik gati jari rahete hue bhi hit ke dauraan racket gum jaataa he
 This makes a slight change in direction, but it does not require much time
 badminton main jeet ke liye, khilaadiyon ko sahi sthiti main vibhinn tarah ke stroke kii zaroorat hoti he
 Its range is from powerful jumps to smashes to subtle tumbling to return from the net
 aksar reliyon kaa ant smash se hota he, lekin smash ko sthapit karne ke liye teevr stroke kii zaroorat he
 For example, a netshort may force the adversary to lift the shuttlecock, providing an opportunity for smash
 agar netshort tang or ludhaknevaala he to virdohi kaa lift court ke peeche tak pahunch jayega, jo vaapasi ke liye anuvarthi smash ko bahut kathin bana detaa he
 Deception is also important
 visheshgy khilaadi ke kai tarah ke stroke taiyaar karte hai, jo ek jaise dikhte hai or gati yaa stroke kii disha ke bare main apane virodhiyon ko dhokhe main daalane ke liye ve slising kaa upyog karte hai
 If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, he may go in the wrong direction and be unable to change his body's speed to reach the shuttlecock at the right time
 donon jodi jab kabhi sambhav ho neeche kii ore smash karke laabh uthaane or hamale ko barkaraar rakhane kii koshish karegaa
 Whenever possible, the pair will create an ideal attack array, with one player hitting the bottom from the rearcourt and his partner returning the lift in the midcourt, stopping all smashes in between
 If the attacker of the rearcourt plays a dropshot, his partner will move towards the forecourt, taking the risk of going to the forecourt
 If the pair cannot hit, they will use flat strokes to try to take advantage of the attack
 agar jodi shatalkock ko lift yaa clear karne ko majaboor kar di jaati he to unhen bachaav karnaa chahie: ve rear midcourt main ve virdohi ke smash kaa muqabla karne ke liye apane court kii puri chaudaai ko cover karne ke liye paas-paas rahane kii sthiti ko apanaayenge
 yugal khel main, khilaadi aamtaur par bich maidan main do khiladiyon ke bich bhram or takaraav kaa laabh uthaane ke liye smash karata he
 In high level sports, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serve is almost never seen in professional sports
 virdohi ko hamale se laabh uthaane se rokane kii koshish main sidhe lo sarv kaa bahut adhik istemaal hone laga he
 Flick serve is used to prevent the opponent from already expecting Lo Serve and attacking decisively
 ucch str ke khel main yugal raily bahut hi tej hota he
 Men's doubles are the most aggressive form of badminton, with high proportions jumping and smashing full force
 ekal court yugal court kii tulana main sankara hota he, lekin lambaai main ek samaan, sarv main ekal or yugal main back box baahar hota he
 Because one person is required to cover the entire court, the single strategy is based on forcing the opponent to walk as much as possible; This means that a single stroke is usually associated with the corner of the court
 drapeshort or netshort ke saath lift or clear ke sangyojan se khilaadi court kii puri lambaai kaa phayda uthaata he
 Smashes are less common in singles than in doubles, as players are rarely in the ideal position to smash, and if the smash returns, smashers are often hurt
 ekal main, khilaadi zyaadaatar forehand hai sarv ke saath raily kii shuruuaat karegaa
 Constant low serve either forehand or backhand is also used
 flik sarv kam hi hota he or drive sarv to viral hi he
 In high level sports, singles require significant fitness
 yugal ke bahut hi akraamakata ke vipareet, ekal dhairyavan sthitijanya daanv kaa khel he
 In mixed doubles, both the pair try to maintain aggression with the woman in the front and the man in the back
 iskaa kaaran yah he purush khilaadiyon jo kaaphi majboot hote hai or isliye ve jo smash karte hai vah bahut hi shaktishaalee hota hai
 Consequently, in mixed doubles, strategic awareness and subtle situational play are greatly needed
 chaalaak virdohi mahila ko peeche kii taraf or purush ko aage kii ore aane ke liye majaboor karte hue unki adarsh sthiti ko badalane kii koshish karegaa
 To avoid this danger, the mixed player has to be alert and systematic in choosing his shot
 ucch str ke khel main, sanrachana aamtaur par lacheelee hoti he: chotii kii mahila khilaadi riercourt se puri takat ke saath khilne main sakasham hoti he or jab isaki zaroorat ho to vah khushi-khushi aisa kar legi
 baharhaal, jab mauka miltaa he, mahila ko samaane kii taraf rakhkar jodi phir se maanak mishrit aakraamak sthiti main jaaegi
 The left-handed player gets a natural advantage against the right-handed player
 aisa isliye ki duniya main zyaadaatar daahine haath ke khilaadi hai 
 If you play with the left hand, the forehand and backhand change, so a shot in the court on your right will result in a very powerful smash against you
 is kaaran baayen haath ke khiladiyon kaa jhukaav unke forehand kii taraf adhik se adhik shot daalane kaa hoga or falswaroop unka bankehand puri tarah se prashikshit nahin hota he
 Therefore, the main weakness of a left-handed player is his backhand
 yah jaanane ke baad, baayen haath ke ek khilaadi ko apane zyaadaatar shots court ke baayen ore khilne kii koshish kerani chahie
 This is because despite the right-hand man's forehand, the return of the shot to your forehand will ensure that you can continue smashing
 yah kaha jaataa he ki baayen haathwaalon ke smashes behatar hote hai
 This is partly true because the left-handed player is able to make rare angles and also because the wings on the shuttlecock are positioned in a way that helps the left-handed player
 haalanki, ek baayen haath kaa khilaadi khud uljhan main pad jayega, jab vah ek samakaksh saathi ke saath khel rahaa ho
 Left-handed / right-handed doubles pairings are very common in advanced level games
 isaki vajah yah he ki inhen daahine haath / daahine haath yaa baayen haath / baayen haath kii yugal jodi par ek vishisht laabh praapt hota he
 The most notable benefit is that none of the side of the court is weak
 isse virdohi team ko yah sochane main adhik samay lagata he ki koun-si said bacand he or shatalkock ko vahaan bhejnaa he, kyonki ek saamaanya dahini / dahini jodi ke viruddh aap aamtaur par lagbhag hameshaa court ke aapaki dahini ore hi bhejte hai, jabaki LH / RH jodi raily ke dauraan apane kamjor paksh main parivartan kar liya karti he
 The left-handed player also has another advantage in smashing
 chidiya ke pankh ke shatalkock main ek prakritik spin hota he, isliye jab baayen haath se shatalkock ko halake se tirchhe shot lagaate hai tab aap prakritik spin kaa laabh uthaate hue use draig karke tej smash karte hai
 The same effect occurs when a right-handed player slices a shot with his backhand
 iskaa ek bahut acha udhaaharan ten boon heong hai, jo ek baayen haath ke khilaadi hai, jinke naam 421 kimi / ghanta kaa vishwa record he
 The World Badminton Association is the internationally recognized government body of the sport

 badminton main sabase shaktishaalee stroke smash he, jo tezi se neeche kii taraf virodhiyon ke mid court main maaraa jaataa he
 The maximum speed of a smashed shuttlecock is much higher than any other racket sport projectile
 khilaadi ke racket se chhootane ke tatkaal baad is gati kii recording ko shatalkock kii praarambhik gati se mapa jaataa he
 In the men's doubles at the 2009 Japan Open, Malaysian player Tan Boon Yong made an official world record of 421 km / h
 badminton kii tulana aksar tennis se kii jaati he
 a list of non-controversial comparisons is as follows: smash gati jaisi sankhyikee 261 mile / ghanta, usase adhik, furtile badminton utsaahiyon kii anya tulanaayen adhik vivaadaaspad hai
 For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racket sport
 haalanki racket ke khelon main sabase tej aarambhik gati kaa record badminton ke naam he, anya prakshepya jaise ki tennis gendon kii tulana main vaastavik rup se shatalkock kaa avamandan kaaphi tej hota he
 In addition, this ability must be judged by the distance the shuttlecock has to travel: a smashed shuttlecock travels a short distance from a tennis ball during one's serve
 sabase tej racket ke khel ke rup main badminton kaa daawa bhi pratikriya samay kii aavashyaktaaon ke aadhaar par ho saktaa he, lekin yakeenan teble tennis main isse tej pratikriya samay bhi aavashyaktaa he
 There is a strong argument in favor that badminton demands far more physical ability than tennis, but such comparisons are difficult to objectify given the varying demands of sports
 kuch anaupchaarik adhyayanon se sanket miltaa he ki badminton ko tennis khiladiyon se adhik aerobics kshamta kii zaroorat he, lekin is vishay par bahut kade shodh nahin kiye gaye hai
 a more balanced approach has been suggested in the following comparison, although these are also the subject of controversy: badminton or tennis kii takanic kaaphi alag hai
 The lightness of the shuttlecock and the badminton allow the player to use the wrist and fingers more than the tennis players of the racket; In tennis, the wrist is usually fixed and rotating the wrist can cause injury
 isi ek hi kaaran se, badminton khilaadi racket ke chote swing se takat paidaa kar sakate hai: aisa hi stroke jaise net kil, main bade khilaadi 5 se
me
 se bhi kam swing kar sakate hai
 a stroke that requires more strength will usually use a longer swing, but a badminton racket will rarely swing like a tennis swing
 aksar yah kaha jaataa he ki badminton stroke mukhya rup se kalai se lage jaati he
 This is a misconception and can be criticized for two reasons
 pehali, ise ekadam se varg truti kaha ja saktaa he: kalai kii ek jod he, mansapeshi nahin, baanh kii mansapeshiyaan isaki harakat ko niyantrit karti hai
 Second, wrist movements are weaker than forward or upper arm movements
 badminton jaev yantriki vistrut vaigyanik adhyayan kaa vishay nahin he, lekin kuch adhyayan bijli utpaadan main kalai kii choti si bhoomika kii pushti karte hai or isse sanket miltaa he ki upree or nichali baanh ke aantarik or bahya ghurnan main takat kii pramukh bhoomika hoti he
 Modern coaching resources such as the Badminton England Technique DVD illustrate these ideas by emphasizing the forearm rather than wrist movements
 gendon kaa istemaal honevaale zyaadaatar duusare racket ke khelon se shatalkock bahut hi alag he
 The wing provides strong drag, thus causing the shuttlecock to fall far away from the thrust
 shatalkock bhi tej vayugatika se sthir hota he: praarambhik rukh kii parvaah kiye bina, yah cork kii ore se pehle gum kar udega or cork kii ore iskaa rukh rahegaa
 a key to the shuttlecock's drag is that it requires enough skill to hit the full length of the court, which is not the case for most racket sports
 draig shatalkock ke upar uthe hue udan maarg ko bhi prabhavit karata he: iske udan kaa paravalay bahut adhik tirachha hokar yah upar uthne ke bajaae ek dhalaan vaale kone se hokar girtaa he
 Even with a very high serve, the shuttlecock can fall perpendicularly
 apni oochaal main parivartan ke liye gend gum sakati he, or khilaadi is tarah ke spin ke liye slis kar saktaa he ; chunki shatalkock uchhalane kii anumati nahin detaa he, isliye yah badminton main lagu nahin hota he
 Slice the shuttlecock so that it rotates, although it is used and some are specifically for badminton
 uske pankh paraspar ek duusare par is tarah se lage hote hai ki shatalkock prakritik rup se apni dhuree par golai main chakkar lagate hue ghumta he
 When the shuttlecock falls, it rotates counter-clockwise as shown above
 prakritik rup se ghoomane ke kaaran kuch stroke ko prabhavit hote hai: agar slising ection baae se dahini ore ke bajaae daahine se baayin ore ho to tambling netshot kahin adhik prabhavi hota he

 aitihaasik rup se abhaasi kaary tathaa isse sambandhit vicharan calculas kaa vikaas drudh pindon kii gati ke liye kiya gaya tha kintu in siddhanton kaa prayog virupya pindon kii yantriki kaa adhyayan karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 If you use this principle in the context of the equilibrium of a mechanical system, then one can say that the sum of virtual actions done by all the forces on a system is zero
 abhaasi kaary = bal x abhaasi visthaapan
 By applying the principle of virtual force to a mechanical system, as many equations can be obtained as the 'degree of freedom' of that system
 dhyaan rahe ki abhaasi visthaapan atyant sookshm liye jate hai taaki balon kii dishaao evam duriyon ke sambandh aparivartit rahen
