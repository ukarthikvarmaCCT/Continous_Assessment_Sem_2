 In the physical past, it has generally been accepted that pain medication is not given until the surgeon has evaluated the chance of the patient, therefore, as "not corrupt" examination
 This line of practice, combined with the fact that the surgeon may sometimes take hours to come to evaluate the patient, especially if he or she is in the middle of surgery or is in the drive from home, is often a situation That is ethically questionable leads to the best
 Recently, due to a better understanding of the importance of controlling pain in patients, it has been shown that physical examination is actually not that dramatically disturbing when pain medication is given prior to medical evaluation

 Typical acute appendicitis will resolve quickly and sometimes spontaneously for appendectomy
 If appendicitis resolves spontaneously, it remains controversial whether an elective interval appendectomy should be performed to prevent a recurrent episode of appendicitis
 Atypical appendicitis is more difficult to diagnose and is more complex, usually in either early diagnosis and appendectomy, with the best results in two to three weeks

 anya kaa nirmaan tab hota he jab anya prakaar ke chakravaat ushnkaribandheey visheshtaon ko uparjit kar lete hai
 Tropical systems when removed from the circulation of winds in the troposphere; If the environments remain favorable, tropical disturbance intensifies and an eye can also develop

 saanchaa:tropicalcyclone All tropical cyclones are regions of low atmospheric pressure near the Earth's surface
 ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ke kendron par record kiya gaya dabaav samudr str par prithvi kii sataha par hone vaale dabaavon main sabase kam hota he
 Tropical cyclones are largely characterized and driven by the release of the underlying heat of condensation, which occurs when moist air is carried upward and its water vapor freezes
 yah garmi tufaan ke centre ke chaaron ore khadi vitarit kii jaati he
 Thus, the environment within a cyclone at a given altitude is warmer than its external environment
 ek tej ushnkaribandheey chakravaat sanchalan ke centre main duubate hue hawa ke ek kshetra ko sharan degaa
 If this area is strong enough, it can develop into a large "eye"
 The weather inside the eye is generally calm and devoid of clouds, although the sea can be extremely violent
 netra saamaanya rup se aakaar main gol hota he or aakaar main 3 kilometre se 370 kilometre vyas ke bich kaa hota he
 Intense, mature tropical cyclones sometimes exhibit an outward rotation of the top of an eyewall and resemble a football stadium; This process is sometimes referred to as the stadium effect
 anya suvidhaayen bhi hai jo yaa to netra ko chaaron ore se gher leti he, yaa ise dhak leti hai
 The central dense overcast is a concentrated area of strong thunderstorm activity near the center of a tropical cyclone; In weak tropical cyclones, CDO can completely cover the center
 iwal netra ke chaaron ore tej jhanjavat kaa ek chakra he; yah vahi jagah he jahaan sarvaadhik teevr hawaaen pai jaati he, jahaan badal sabase oonche sthaan par pahunch jate he or tivrata sabase baari hoti he
 The heaviest wind damage occurs where the eyewall of a tropical cyclone passes over land
 iwal pratisthaapan chakra teevr ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton main swaabhaavik rup se hote hai
 When cyclones reach the peak of intensity they usually have an eyewall and a maximum wind radius that shrinks to a very small size, ranging from about 10 kilometers to 25 kilometers
 bahya varsha-pattee ek jhanjavat kaa ek bahari ring bana sakati he jo dhire dhire andar kii ore hatati jaati he or bhitari yaaol se aavashyak nami or koniya gati ko chin leti he
 When the inner eyewall weakens, the tropical cyclone also weakens the outer eyewall completely replacing the inner eyewall at the end of the cycle
 tufaan ek hi tivrata ke ho sakate he jais ki vah pehle the yaa iwal pratisthaapan chakra ke purna hone ke baad pehle se zyada teevr bhi ho saktaa he
 The storm may intensify again as it again constructs a new outer ring for the next eyewall replacement

 If the radius is two degrees less than the axis, or 222 kilometers, then the cyclone is "very small" or a "dwarf"
 3 or 6 akshansh degree ke bich kii ek trigya yaa 333 kilometre se 670 kilometre "ausat aakaar" kaa mana jaataa he
 "very large" tropical cyclones have a radius of more than 8 degrees or a radius of 888 kilometers

 Other methods of determining a tropical cyclone shape include measuring the radius of thunderstorm winds and measuring its corresponding VORTCT area radius
 Measuring winds included in the radius of a center thunderstorm force and measuring its radius with a relative area of −1
 Vorticity decreases to −5 1 × 10

 Therefore, a tropical cyclone can be seen as a massive vertical heat engine that is driven by physical mechanics forces such as the Earth's gravity and rotation
 ek anya rup main, ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ko ek vishesh prakaar ke messoskale sanvahani sankul ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jo saapeksh nami or garmi ke ek vishaal strot ke upar bananaa jari rahata he
 While an initial hot core system, such as an organized storm system, is necessary for the formation of a tropical cyclone, a flow of energy is required to reduce atmospheric pressure
 Strengthening the inherent moisture and heat flow from the ocean surface is important for tropical cyclones
 chakravaat main aavak kaa ek mahatvapurn bhaag vayumandal ke sabase nichle 1 kilometre main he
 Condensation leads to high wind speeds, a fraction of the energy released as mechanical energy, strong winds and the low pressure associated with them leads to increased surface evaporation and thus even more condensation
 Most of the energy released rises which increases the height of storm clouds and increases condensation
 yah sakaaratmak pratikriya tab tak ke liye jari rahati he jab tak ushnkaribandheey chakravaat vikaas ke liye sthitiyaan anukool hoti hai
 Factors such as the constant lack of equilibrium in the distribution of air amount will provide the support energy for the cyclone

 The fact that distinguishes tropical cyclones mainly from other seasonal events is intense convection as an induction force
 Because convection is strong in tropical climates, it defines the initial domain of tropical cyclones
 iske vipareet, madhya akshansh chakravaat purv maujuud kshaitij taapmaana se apni zyaadaatar urja aakarshith karte hai
 In order to keep its heat engine running, a tropical cyclone must remain above the hot water, which provides the atmospheric moisture needed so that the positive feedback loop remains on
 jab ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat bhoomi se gujarata he, iskaa taap strot isse cat jaataa he or yah apni takat kho detaa he
 The passing of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layer of the sea to cool down significantly, which can subsequently affect the growth of the cyclone
 yah sheetaleekaran mukhya rup se hawa kii vajah se samudr kii gaharaai se thande pani ke upar uthne se hota he
 Cold water weakens the storm

 Although the movement of the clouds is clearly towards the center, in tropical cyclones the flow of clouds also develops at an upper level
 yah tufaan ingine kii "chimney" ke madhyam se ucch oonchai par utpann hota he ki hawa isaki nami kii or ke madhyam se nishkasit hoti he
 This outflow produces thin cirrus clouds that move away from the center

 There are low amounts of wind shear, high fleece circulation is needed as storm is disruptive
 Tropical cyclones generally need more than 555 km of latitude 5 or far from the equator to form, allowing the Coriolis circulation to deflect another from the effects of winds blowing towards lower pressures Center construction
 Lastly, the current system of an early tropical cyclone season needs a disturbed prior, although no development cyclone will take place without circulation
 Disturbances associated with low-latitude and low-level westerly Madden – Julian oscillation wind can make tropical conditions favorable for cyclogensis initiated by the tropics

 Tropical cyclones move westward to the subtropical ridge of Acuntuard, as they move
 Most of these systems form between 10 and 30 degrees away from the equator and 87% form no further than 20 degrees south, latitude or north
 Because the Coriolis effect initiates cyclones and the tropical cyclone rotates, the tropical form is rarely the weakest or the Coriolis effect where it moves about 5 degrees within the equator
 However, it is possible for Vamy to form cyclones within this range as Tropical Storm Tropical cyclones in 2001 and in 2004

 In the equator, the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, tropical cyclogenesis is strongly influenced by the seasonal movement of the eastward, rather than the trough monsoon, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone
 Tropical cyclones could also be steered by other systems, such as other low-pressure systems, high-pressure front systems, and front cold s
 prithvi kaa ghurnan ek bal utpann karata he jise coreolis prabhaav, coreolis twaran, yaa aam boli main coreolis twaran kehete hai
 This system causes cyclone acceleration to turn the poles in the strong absence of steering currents
 The eastern part of a tropical cyclone incorporates poleward winds and the Coriolis effect pulls them slightly more poleward

 When the subtropical ridge crosses a tropical cyclone axis, its high pressure area around the general track of the pressure zone is significantly deflected again by the winds towards the lower normal
 When the cyclone becomes a track component, with a vigorous poleward to the east, cyclone recirculation has begun

 Officially, landfall is when a storm center crosses the beach not its edge
 Hurricane conditions may be experienced on the coast, and hours before inland landfall, in fact, a tropical cyclone may just start its strong winds over land, not to make landfall, if it does
 It is said that the storm made a direct hit on the coast
 As a result of the narrowness of this definition, the landfall area experiences half of a land-bound storm by real-time landfall
 For emergency preparations, the action should be from the time when a certain wind speed will reach the ground, or the intensity of rainfall will not occur since landfall

 Weak or diffusion shear wind can occur if it experiences, due to the engine stepping away from between convection and heat, it normally develops a tropical cyclone
 Additionally, its interaction with the main belt of westerly wind, by means of merging together near the frontal region, can cause tropical cyclones to develop into extratropical cyclones

 Earlier in an episode in 1947, disaster struck Zachsonville when a hurricane preceded, Florida changed its course immediately after being seeded and smashed in Georgia, smashed
 Because there is so much uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government will not accept seeding operations until there is a less than 10% chance of landfall within 48 hours of the storm, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms 
 The first attempt of the project was dropped after it was discovered that the naturally occurring replacement cycle in ivol cast doubt on the outcome of the Hurricanes, casting
 Today, it is known that seeding silver yodid is very unlikely to have a possibility because the effect of a soft amount of water in the rhombunds is tropical cyclone

 Although cyclones take a heavy toll in property and personal life, they may be important factors in precipitation regimes, as they may bring much needed precipitation to dry areas otherwise
 Tropical cyclones also help maintain global heat balance by moving the hot, moist tropics and mid-latitudes of the polar regions
 Hurricanes and the rise winds of Hurricanes can be destructive to human-made structures, but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries, which are typically important fish breeding sites
 The destruction of tropical cyclones prevents redevelopment, greatly increasing local property values

 Not a spiral shaped organization
 However, this system is already a low pressure, hence the name "fall"

 Tropical storms reaching the power storm were given names initially to end the confusion when there are several systems in the basin of any person at the same time, which warns people in aid of storms
 In most cases, a tropical cyclone has its name throughout its life, but under special circumstances, tropical cyclones can be named while active

 The list is decided on the basis of storm forecasts, either by discussion of committees primarily called by the National Meteorological Office, or by the World Meteorological Organization
 Each year, the names of particularly devastating storms are "retired" and new names are chosen to take their place

 Before the Hurricanes or satellite era, in the early 1960s, tropical storms went undetected until a reconnaissance aircraft encountered a storm, a ship or a storm, reported a trip through the hurricane hit the country in a populated area
 Government records, therefore, may recall storms in which no ship experienced thunderstorm power winds, it reported recognition as a tropical storm, returned harbor and experience

 Hurricane Destructivity is a measure of the combination of surface storm strength, duration and correlated high frequency, with the possibility that tropical sea temperatures are stated in an article by Carrie Emanuel in Nature, reflecting the well-documented climate and signs in the Atlantic North , Including Multidecadal Oscillations North Pacific and Global Warming "
 Emanuel predicts "a significant increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century
 In the more recent published work in the March 2008 issue of the Bulletin of Emanuel, he states that new climate modeling data indicates that global warming should occur

 However, there is no agreement regarding the magnitude of the effects of anthropogenic global warming on tropical cyclone formation, track is universal and intensity

 a tropical cyclone can become extratropical, because if its energy source, the heat released by condensation, causes a variation in temperature between the air segments it extends upward; In addition, extratropical cyclones can also transform into a tropical storm and then form a tropical cyclone, although this is not often the case

 He also used to give his advice on those incidents

 He went to the forest for hunting one day
 unke jane ke baad hi unki patni rajaswala ho gai
 He sent this news to the king through his bird of prey
 samachar paakar maharaj sudhanva ne ek done main apana veery nikaal kar pakshi ko de diya
 The bird flew into the sky to bring the two to the king's wife
 maarg main us shikari pakshi ko ek duusari shikari pakshi mil gaya
 There was war between the two birds
 yuddh ke dauraan vah dona pakshi ke panje se chhot kar yamuna main ja gira
 In the Yamuna, there lived a nymph made of fish due to the curse of Brahma
 machhlee rupi apsara done main behate huye veery ko nigal gai tathaa uske prabhaav se vah garbhvatee ho gai
 On completion of the pregnancy, a Nishad trapped the fish in his net
 nishad ne jab machhlee ko chira to uske pet se ek balak tathaa ek balika nikali
 Nishad went to Maharaj Sudhanwa with those babies
 maharaj sudhanva ke putr na hone ke kaaran unhone balak ko apane paas rakh liya jiskaa naam matsayraj hua
 The girl remained near Nishad and was named Matsyagandha because the smell of fish emitted from her organs
 us kanya ko satyavati ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 When she grew up, she started doing boat work
 Once Parashar Muni had to sit on her boat and cross the Yamuna
 parashar muni satyavati rup-soundarya par aasakt ho gayi or bole, "devi! main tumhaare saath sahavaas karnaa chahta hoon
 "satyavati said," Muniver! You are a theologian and i am a Nishad girl
 hamaara sahavaas sambhav nahin he
 "then Parashar Muni said," Balike! Do not worry prasuti hone par bhi tum kumari hi rahogi
 "having said this, he created a thick mist network around his yoga force and indulged with Satyavati

 According to Hindu scriptures, Maharishi Vyasa was a trikala
 tathaa unhone divya drushti se dekh kar jaan liya ki kaliyug main dharm ksheen ho jaayegaa
 Due to the degeneration of religion, humans will become atheists, dutyless and young
 ek vishaal veda kaa sangopang adhyayan unke samarth se baahar ho jaayegaa
 That is why Maharishi Vyas divided the Vedas into four parts so that even those with less intelligence and less memory could study the Vedas
 vyas ji ne unka naam rakhaa - rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda
 Vyas ji became famous as Ved Vyas because of the division of Vedas
 rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda ko kramshah apane shishy pel, jaimin, vaishampayan or sumantumuni ko padhaayaa
 Veda Vyasa composed the Puranas in the form of the fifth Veda in which the knowledge of Veda is told in the form of interesting stories, because the knowledge contained in Veda is very esoteric and dry
 puraanon ko unhone apane shishy rome harshan ko padhaayaa
 Vyas ji's disciples made many branches and sub-branches of those Vedas according to their own wisdom
 vyas ji ne mahabharat kii rachana kii

 maharaj kaashi naresh ke ramnagar durg main bhi pashchim bhaag main vyaseshwar kii murti viraajman he jise saadhaaran janata chota vedavyas ke naam se jaanati he
 In fact, this is the most ancient idol of Ved Vyas

 mahabharat ke sambandh main swayan vyasaji kii hi ukti adhik sateek he- is granth main jo kuch he, vah anyatra he, panratu jo isamen nahin he, vah anyatra kahin bhi nahin he
 He was born in an island of Yamuna in Kalpi
 vyasaji krishna dwaipayan kahalaaye kyonki unka rang shyaam tha
 As soon as he was born, he went to do penance with the mother's command and said that whenever you will remember, i will come
 ve dhritarashtra, pandu tathaa vidura ke janmdata hi nahin, apitu vipatti ke samay ve chaaya kii tarah pandavon kaa saath bhi dete the

 After studying the Vedas, he taught his disciples Sumantu, Jaimini, Pal and Vaishampayan, and his son Shukadeva, and preached the Mahabharata
 aapaki is alokik pratibha ke kaaran aapako bhagwaan kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 Vyasa has become the best poet in Sanskrit literature after Valmiki
 inke likhe kavy 'aarsh kavy' ke naam se vikhyath hai
 The purpose of Vyas ji is not to describe the war by writing Mahabharata, but to show the essence of this physical life
 unka kathan he ki bhale hi koi purush vedang tathaa upanishdon ko jaan le, lekin vah kabhi vichkshan nahin ho saktaa kyonki yah mahabharat ek hi saath arthshaastra, dharamshastra tathaa kaamshaastra he
