 There is evidence that leprosy does not develop in all people infected with M

 aisa anumaan he ki anuvaanshik karkon ke kaaran keval 5% logon main hi kushtarog hone kaa khatra hota he

 The path of entry of M

 Rees and mcdougal succeeded in the experimental transmission of leprosy through M

 In short, penetration through the respiratory tract is the most likely route, although other routes, especially broken skin, cannot be ignored
 The CDC has expressed the following assumption about the transmission of the disease: "although the route of transmission of Hansen's disease remains uncertain, most researchers believe that M
 leprae usually spreads from person to person via respiratory drops

 " In leprosy, it is difficult to define reference points for both the incubation period and the time of infection and the measurement of the onset of disease; The first one due to adequate immunological devices and the second due to the slow onset of the disease
 Despite this, various researchers have attempted to measure the incubation time for leprosy

 Although annual expansion as a measure of transmission — the number of new cases of leprosy received annually — is important, leprosy is characterized by long incubation periods, late diagnosis and early stages of the disease
 Leprosy is difficult to measure due to lack of laboratory equipment to be able to do this
 iske bajaay, panjikrut prasar kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Registered prevalence is a useful representative indicator of the burden of the disease because it indicates the number of active cases of leprosy diagnosed with the disease at any point in time and receiving MDT treatment

 pichley varsh ke dauraan pahachaane gaye nae maamalon kii sankhya 296,499 thi
 The reason for this annual identification number exceeding its prevalence at the end of that year can be explained by the fact that a part of new cases completed their treatment within a year and hence they are no longer on the register
 The number of new cases identified globally continues to decline and in 2005 it decreased by 110,000 cases compared to the previous year

 The first record of the mention of the word Leprasi is found in Leviticus 13: 2 - "when the skin of a man's flesh will have a bulge, a scab, or a bright scar, and it will be like a leprosy epidemic in the skin of the flesh; He will be brought to the priest Aaron or to one of his priest sons

 There is a character created by Barry
 vah ek shararti ladkaa he jo ud saktaa he or usne jaadui tareeke se bada hone se manaa kar diya he, peter pan apana kabhi-nahin khatm honevaala bachapan romaanchak andaaj main, nevarland ke ek chote se dweep par apane giroh "lost bvoize" ke leader ke rup main matsay kanyaon, pariyon, bharatiyon or samudri daakuon ke sampark main rahakar or samay-samay par baahar kii duniya ke saadhaaran bacchon se milakar bitaata he
 In addition to two distinctive works by Barry, the character has been portrayed in a variety of media and business mediums, both as an adaptation and an extension of Barry's work
 peter pan sabase pehle 1902 main vayaskon ke liye likhe gaye upanyaas da little white bird ke ek khand main saamne aayaa tha
 After the highly successful debut of a play about Peter Pan in 1904, Barry's publishers, Hodder and Staughton, took out chapters 13–18 of The Little White Bird and were published in 1906 under the title Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, Arthur
 Republished with additional excerpts illustrated by Rachem
 is paatr kii sabase prasiddh romaanchak shuruyaat 27 disambar 1904 ko rangamanchi naatak peter pan, yaa da bvaay hu wood note gro ap ke rup main hui thi
 The play was somewhat adapted and expanded into a novel published in 1911, Peter and Wendy, which later became Peter Pan and Wendy, and only Peter Pan left after that
 tab se peter pan anekon roopantaranon, uttar kathaon or purv kathaon main saamne aayaa he, jinamein 1953 kii vyapak rup se prasidd anemated feechar film walt dijani kii peter pan, anekon rangamanchi sangeet kaaryakramon, live ection feechar filmon hook or peter pan or adhikrut uttar kathatmak upanyaas peter pan in skarlet shaamil hai
 He has also appeared in a wide variety of works that are not authorized by the copyright owners of this character, whose rights have expired in most parts of the world
 peter pan par aadhaarit kritiyon kii suchidekhen
 In the stories written on Peter Pan, many have gained widespread fame
 pustakon, filmon, aadi kii suchi ke liye peter pan par aadhaarit kritiyon ko dekhen, jinamein iske atirikt peter pan kii anya kahaniyaan shaamil hai
 Barry never described Peter's character in detail, not even in the novel Peter & Wendy, leaving much of it to the readers' imagination and the presentation of anyone who adapted the character
 In "peter and Wendy", Barry mentions that Peter Pan still has all his milk teeth
 uskaa varnan ve ek sundar muskaan ke saath ek sundar ladke ke rup main karte hai, "kankal kii pattiyon main lipta or pedo se nikalne vaale ras main duba hua"
 naatak main, peter kii poshaak sharad ritu ke patton or makadi ke jaalon se bani he
 His name and his flute playing give the appearance of being slightly similar to the mythological character Pan
 paaramparik taur par is charitra ko rangamanch par ek yuvati dwaara nibhaayaa gaya he, jo ek aisa nirnay he jise praathmik rup se kalakaaron ko chunane main aanevaali kathinaaiyon, yahan tak ki peter kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale kalakaar se bhi chote or anya bacchon ke nahin milane ke kaaran liya gaya tha, isiliye is charitra kii rangamanch par prastuti ko kabhi is rup main nahin liya gaya ki peter "vastav main" kaisaa dikhataa he
 In Peter Pan in Scarlett, Geraldine mccorian adds her blue eyes to explain her appearance, saying that her hair is light colored
 In this novel, autumn arrives in Never Land, so Peter wears a tunic of neelkanth's wings and maple leaves, instead of his summer dress
 dev bairi or ridley pearson dwaara likhi gayi starcachars kii kahaniyon main, peter ke bal gaajar-naarangi jaise rang ke hai or uski ankhen chamakdaar neeli hai
 In Disney films, Peter wears a costume that is easy to animation, including a short-sleeved green tunic and apparently made of cloth tights and a cap with a feather
 uske paas devon kii tarah nukile kaan hai or uske bal bahut gahare bhure-laal rang ke he
 In a 2003 live-action film she is shown by Jeremy Sumpter with curly hair and blue eyes and her dress is made of leaves and vines
 hook main, vah gahare bhure baalo vaale ek vayask vyakti robin williams ke rup main dikhaai detaa he, lekin yuvavastha ke flashbek main uske bal kahin adhik naarangi jaise rang ke hai
 In this film, his ears are pointed only when he is "peter Pan", not "peter Banning"; His pan clothing resembles a Disney costume
 ek ladke kii yah dharna ki vah kabhi bada nahin hoga, je

 Ironically, "the boy who never grows up" has appeared as boys of different ages
 da little white bird main apane mul swaroop main vah keval saat dinon kaa ek shishu he
 Although his age is not mentioned elsewhere in Barry's later plays and novels, his characterization is clearly that of a child of many years
 pustak main kaha gaya he ki uske paas sabhi shishu daant maujuud hai or peter kii pratimaa ke liye bairi kaa icchit model vah he jo kencington gardens main laga hua he jo maaikel levelin devies kii tasveeron kaa ek set thi jise chah varsh kii aayu main liya gaya tha
 In the early pictorial interpretation of this character, it usually appears to be of the same age or possibly a few years older than it
 1953 ke digni ke roopantaran or 2002 kii isaki uttar katha main, peter bachapan kii aakiri avasthaa, 10 or 13 saal ke bich kaa prathit hota he
 The actor who lent it his voice in 1953 was 15-year-old Bobby Driscoll
 2003 kii film main, jab film banani shuru hui jeremi stumpar 13 varsh kaa tha, lekin film banaakar puri hone tak vah 14 varsh kaa ho gaya tha or kuch inch lanbaa bhi ho gaya tha
 In the film Hooke, it was said that Peter left Neverland many years ago, forsaking his infinite youth and normal aging
 apane dafan hue ateet ko yaad karte hue, peter ko ek shishu or chote ladke ke rup main or kishoravastha kii dahalij par dikhaaya gaya he, jiske liye yah tark diya gaya he ki nevarland main umr badhane kii prakriya tabatak puri tarah nahin rukati he jabatak ki kishoravastha yaa isse thik pehle kii avasthaa nahin aa jaati, yaa phir yah ki prayek baar jab peter nevarland ko chhodkar vaastavik duniya main jaataa he, uski umr thodi bad jaati he

 List of Sarsanghchalakas of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: praaia: aisa kaha jaataa he ki ki sangh ek vikasshil sanghathan he
 Not only branch or miscellaneous work, many traditions also develop on their own
 paariwarik sanghathan hone ke kaaran yahaan har kaam ke liye samvidhan nahin dekhnaa padataa
 The outside viewer may find it strange; But those who have been watching the Sangh and its functioning for a long time are familiar with its reality
 unke liye yah saamaanya baat he
 If we look at the Sarsanghchalak tradition, then His Holiness Dr
 Hedgewar was made Sarsanghchalak by his colleagues without his knowledge
 dow ji ne is avasar par kaha ki aapke aadesh kaa paalan karte hue main yah jimmedaari le rahaa hum; par jaise hi mujhase yogya koi vyakti aapako mili, aap use yah daayitv de dena
 i will work with him like a normal volunteer
 jab doctor ji kaa swasthya bahut bighad gaya, to unhone apane sahyogiyon se paraamarsh kar apane lumber-panchar oparation se purv sabake saamne hi shri guruji ko bataa diya ki mere baad aapako sangh kaa kaam sanbhaalanaa he
 Thus the Sangh attained the second Sarsanghchalak
 jab shri guruji ko laga ki ab yah sharir lambe samay tak saath nahin de paaegaa, to unhone bhi apane sahyogi kaaryakartaaon se paraamarsh kiya or ek patr dwaara shri balasahab devaras ko naveen sarasanghachaalak ghoshit kiya
 The letter was opened after his death
 balasahab ne shri guruji ke dehanth ke baad yah jimmedaari sanbhali, isse logon ke man main yah dharna bani ki yah jimmedaari aaajeevan hoti he tathaa purv sarasanghachaalak apni icchaanusaar kisi ko bhi yah daayitv de sakate hai
 The opponents of the Union used to call it a secret organization; But now they also considered it undemocratic
 shri balasahab devaras ne apane purv ke donon sarasanghachaalkon dwaara apanaayi gayi vidhi se hatakar naye sarasanghachaalak kii niyukti kii
 He declared Shri Rajju Bhaiya the new Sarsanghchalak in front of all the representatives of the All India House of Representatives, when the health was very bad
 maa0 rajju bhaiya or phir shri sudarshan ji ne bhi isi vidhi kaa paalan kiya
 Thus a new tradition developed in the Sangh
 is ghatnakram ko ek or drushtikon se dekhen
 When Balasaheb was relieved of his obligation, his health was very poor
 ve pahiyaa kursi par hi chal pate the
 Spit was frequently filled in the mouth, so he had difficulty in speaking too
 unke likhit sandesh hi sab kaaryakramon main sunaae jate the
 They were also able to perform their daily activities with the help of someone
 is kaaran unki daayitv mukti ko sabane sahajata se liya
 On the other hand, when Rajju Bhaiya left the job, he was not fully healthy; Were able to migrate
 saarvajanik rup se manch par bolne main unhen bhi kathinaayee hoti thi; par vyaktigat vaarta ve sahajata se karte the
 He migrated to many provinces despite being free from responsibility
 arthath yadi ve chaahate, to do-teen varsh or is jimmedaari ko nibhaa sakate the; par unhone upyukt vyakti paakar yah kaarybhaar chhod diya
 As far as the fifth Sarsanghchalak Shri Sudarshan ji is concerned, he was quite healthy till his discharge
 pravaas ke saath-saath saarvajanik rup se bolne main unhen kuch kathinaayee nahin thi
 Nevertheless, when he felt that a well-qualified and energetic worker in front of Mr
 Mohan Bhagwat was in front, he too relinquished the responsibility
 spasht he ki unhone vahi kiya, jo aadya sarasanghachaalak dow headgavar ne padbhaar sweekaar karte samay kaha tha ki jab bhi mujhase adhik yogya kaaryakarta aapako mili, aap use sarasanghachaalak bana den
 i will work according to his instructions
 yah he ek parampara main vishwaas or duusari parampara kaa vikaas

 After the death of Pujya Dr
 G
, he was cremated in Reshim Bagh
 aaj vahaan unki samadhi bani he, jise ‘smriti mandir’ kehete hai
 Its exterior is like a temple; But there is nothing like puja, recitation, hour, bhog, aarti, prasad etc
 vahaan doctor ji bhavy pratimaa he, jo teen ore se khuli he
 It is clear that despite the importance of the person in the union, there is no place for person worship
 dwitiya sarasanghachaalak shri guruji ne apane dehanth se purv teen patr likhe the
 In the second letter itself, he had said not to build any memorial for him like Doctorji
 kaaryakartaaon ne unki ichha kaa sammaan karte hue smriti mandir ke saamne unka dah sanskaar kiya
 Today there is a small 'memento' in the form of yajna flame
 us par sant tukaraam kii ve panktiyaan utkeern hai, jinako uddhrut karte hue shri guruji ne apane tisare patr main sab swayamsevakon se kshamaa maangi thi
 Shri Balasaheb Deoras went one step further
 unhone kaaryakartaaon se pehle hi kah diya tha ki reshim baag ko hamen sarasanghachaalkon kaa shmashaan sthal nahin bananaa he
 So my last rites should be performed at the common crematorium
 balasahab kaa dehanth pune main hua; par unhone nagpur main apane jivan kaa kaaphi samay bitaayaa tha
 Many of his friends and relatives were there, who wanted to pay their last respects
 at: unke sharir ko nagpur laakar gangabai ghat par agni ko samarpit kiya gaya
 Like Balasaheb, Rajju Bhaiya also died in Pune
 unhone ek baar yah ichha vyakt kii thi ki unki mrit deh ko nagpur yaa dilli laane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Where he dies, he should be cremated
 isi kaaran unka dah sanskaar pune main hua
 Sudarshan Ji died in Raipur
 unke parthiv sharir ko nagpur laayaa gaya
 Some Sangh activists took his body from a chariot to Ganga Bai Ghat from Reshimbagh for the last rites
 kisi samay sangh par maratha or brahmanvaadi hone kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa tha; par uttar pradesh ke pro rajendra singh or karnatakavasi sudarshan ji ke sarasanghachaalak banane ke baad in logon ke munh sil gayi
 After Mohan Bhagwat's Sarsanghchalak and Suresh Joshi became the Sarkaryavah, these radicals again shouted; But no one gave them grass anymore
 sab samaj chuke hai ki aise aarope bakawaas ke atirikt kuch nahin hai
 Those who call the Sangh as a fakir or the old-fashioned coupmund organization should study the development of the Sarsanghchalak tradition
 abhi sangh ne apni shatabdi nahin manaai he; par iske baad bhi is parampara main anek parivartan hue hai
 It symbolizes the vibrancy of the Sangh and in it lies the secret of the Sangh's energy

 The power of Nirala is that they do not sit idle by miracles and do not steal their eyes from the real challenge of the struggle
