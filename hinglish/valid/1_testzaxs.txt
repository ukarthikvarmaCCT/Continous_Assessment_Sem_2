 There is a difference between the two, but the relationship is also deep
 free software se hi yah sab shuru hua he isaliye aise software ko Free Open Source Software yaa chote main FOSS kaha jaataa he
 Here the word free means freedom, but the word free also means without money, so the use of the word free puts you in some circles

 linus torwaldas, jo linaks ke janmdata hai, ne apni jeevani david dimond ke saath likhi he
 Its name is 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary'
 This is a very good book and reading it motivates us to move forward in life
 He says about open source software in this book, ‘the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest won’t be excluded from its development
 


 So open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It's still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people’s rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that doesn’t mandate legal protection for such secrecy
’ When we are talking about some benefits in open software, it would be very good to see some other side too

 In this, they describe the shortcomings of free software in this way, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
' It is difficult to say which way the software industry will go but many countries and business houses of the world are making open source software their part

 Sometimes the term passcode is used when the secret information is in the digits, such as a personal identification number) that is commonly used for ATM access
 password aam taur par chote hua karte hai taaki aasaani se yaad rakhaa ja sake
 The specific disadvantages of passwords are the reliance on a computing system's cryptographic protocol, which is far more difficult to circumvent, for the purpose of authenticating more irrefutable identities in one computing device than another
 aamtaur par maalik dwaara yaad rakhane main aasaan password kaa arth kisi hamalevar ke liye anumaan lagane main aasaan hona hoga
 Passwords that are difficult to remember will reduce system security; Because the user can write his password somewhere or store it electronically, the user will have to change his password continuously and it is very possible that the user will use his same password again
 Similarly, the most important thing for strengthening the password is, e

 The MD5 and SHA1 cryptographic hash functions are often used
 deies kalan ganit ke ek sanshodhit sanskaran kaa istemaal is uddeshy ke liye shuru-shuru main unics pranali main kiya gaya tha
 Further, the Unix DES function was repeated to slow down the hash function in a frustrated automatic guess attack and encrypt the candidate's password as a key value key, thus creating a password hiding system
 And the attack was blocked

 If the hash function is designed well, then it can be reversed to find the simple text password directly, then it will be impractical due to computational complexity
 However, many systems do not adequately protect their hash passwords and if an attacker guesses the hash value, it uses tools such as dictionaries that compare the encrypted result of each word in some list
 Can widely

 email kiye gaye password aam taur par asurakshit vitaran kaa ek tarika he
 An example of sending clear text of passwords is the original Wikipedia website
 jab aap vikipedia account log in karte hai, aapke yujaranem or password ko clear text ke rup main aapke computer broujar se internet ke madhyam se bheja jaataa he
 In theory, anyone can read them during transit and then enter your account just like you; Wikipedia's server has no way to distinguish such attackers from your side
 vyaavhaarik rup main, koi anjaanaa-sa apekshaakrit badi sankhya yah acchhee tarah kar sakati he 
 Recently, Wikipedia has proposed a secure login option, which, like many e-commerce sites, uses protocol-based SSL / ) cryptography to cancel clear text transmission

 It is best to assign a different password to each user of the system for legitimate users in a system to use the same password, certainly from a security point of view
 This is partly because the user tells the shared password to someone else, instead of revealing their particular password

 Such classification is called 'natural method' and the classification which does not take this approach into consideration is called 'artificial method'
 chakravaat gumti hui vayurashi kaa naam he
 There are two distinctions of a cyclone depending on the region of origin: ushnavalayik chakravaat - ye vayusanghathan yaa tufaan hai, jo ushn katibandh main teevr or anya sthanon par saadhaaran hote hai
 They cause abundant rainfall

 The largest low-pressure systems are called core polar cyclones and extra-tropical cyclones that live on a cyanoptic scale
 garm sat chakravaat jaise ushnkaribandheey chakravaat, messosaclones or dhruviya kam chote messoscale ke bheetar rahati hai
 Intertropical cyclones are intermediate in size
 ye chakravaat prithvi ke baahar anya grahon par jaise mangal or varun par bhi dekhe gaye hai
 Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and fermentation
 chakravaati anchhatirikt ushn katibandheey chakravaat bade akshanshon vaale taapmaana par tarangon kaa rup dhaaran karte he jinhen baroclinics kshetra kaha jaataa he
 The same region shrinks and changes in the atmosphere when it is closed in the cyclonic circulation or takes a violent form
 baad main yahi chakravaat thande kendron ke rup main ban jate he
 The path of a cyclone flows in polar or tropical regions in a cycle of 2 to 6 days

 Fractions of air can vary in temperature or humidity
 majboot thandi hawaaen aamtaur par gambhir mausam main tufaan kii sankeern patteeyon ke rup main, kabhi kabhi prachand rekhaon ke rup main to kabhi sukhi rekhaon ke rup main dikhaai deteen hai
 They form circulation centers in the west and usually move from west to east
 Warm winds remain east of the cyclone center and appear mostly as stratiform
 ye chakravaateey path main dhruv kii ore badhati rahati he
 Closed centers enter the cyclonic life cycle late and wrap up the storm center
 ushnkaribandheey chakravaati ansh ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ke vikaas kii prakriya kaa varnan karata he
 Tropical cyclone latent heat is driven by latent heat of meaningful thunderstorms and is of hot origin
 chakravaaton sahi paristhitiyon main, antah ushn katibandheey, atirikt katibandheey or ushnkaribandheey charnon ke bich parivartan kar sakate hai
 Warm core cyclones over land take the form of misocyclones and can also cause storm formation
 missosexlones se jalstambh bhi ban sakate hai, lekin zyaadaatar ucch asthirataa or kam urdhwadhar hawa katarani ke vaataavaran se viksit hoti he
 All cyclones have some common structural characteristics

 Near the center, the shear force pressure and the Coriolis force must be in a balanced ratio, otherwise a change in pressure can cause a cyclone to collapse
 coreolis prabhaav se ek bade chakravaat ke aasapaas kii vaayu kaa pravaah uttari golarddh main dakshinavart disha main or dakshini golarddh main vamavart disha main ghumta he
 Cyclogenesis is caused by the strengthening of the cyclonic circulation that develops in the atmosphere
 sexogenesis, kai vibhinn prakriyaaon ke liye ek chhatrinuma pad he, jinke parinaam se chakravaat kaa vikaas ho saktaa he
 This can occur at various scales

attirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaat thande sat chakravaaton ke rup main parivartit hone se pehle mausam ke agrant main tarangon ke rup main viksit hote he
 Tropical cyclones are latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity and are of warm origin
 messoccchlons bhoomi par sthit garm chakravaaton ke kaaran banate he or tufaan ke gathan kaa kaaran bhi bana sakate hai
 Waterfalls can also be formed from mesocyclones, but they often develop from environments with high instability and low vertical wind shear
 sexogenisis saclosis ke vipareet he, isamen ek vipareet chakravaateey anuroop hota he jo ucch dabaav kshetra kaa gathan karata he -jise antisaclogenesis kaha jataa he
 There are many ways to make a surface low
 talaroop, purv main sthit uttar-dakshin pahaad par sthit kam dabaav vaale sataha ko kam-str parantu adhik dabaav vaali pranali banane par majaboor kar sakate hai
 All the related systems of the mesoscale can also cause the hot core to become inferior
 yah uthal-puthal aage ko ek lahar kii tarah ban jaataa he or shikhar par nimna bana rahata he
 Definitely it will form the following cyclone
 This rotational flow through its trailing pushes the low polar air from the cold front to the equator and the western hot air from the lower polar circle to the warm front
 aamtaur par thanda front, garam front kii tulana main tej gati se chalata he or ucch ghanatv vaali havarashi jo chakravaat se aage hai, ke saath mil jaati he or ucch ghanatv vaali havarashi jo chakravaat ke peeche he vah ek vyapak garm kshetra ko utpann karti he
 At this time a closed amount is formed, pushing the hot air upwards to form a hot trough called the trowel
 ushnkaribandheey sexlogenesis ek takneekee shabd he jo vaataavaran main sthit ek ushnkaribandheey tufaan ko viksit karne or majboot karne ke liye prayukt hota he
 The process through which tropical cyclogenesis occurs is different from the decrease in mid-latitude cyclogenesis
 ushnkaribandheey chakravaati ansh, ek garam-sat chakravaat ko viksit karne main sahaayak hota he jo anukool mahatvapurn vaataavaran ke kaaran banataa he
 The six main requirements of tropical cyclogenesis are: sufficiently warm sea surface temperature, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the low to mid-level troposphere, the required Coriolis force, a pre-existent low level or shallow and low vertical shear wind
 Around the world, on average 86 annual tropical storms turn into tropical storms
 in main se 47 tufaan / taqatvar aandhi ban jate hai or 20 gahan ushnkaribandheey chakravaat banate he
 Mesocyclones are formed when the speed of the wind shifts with rapid changes and / or highs, setting a fraction by moving in a drain circle at the bottom of the atmosphere
 ek tufaan kii sanvahani updraft is katarani hawa ko ek golakaar abhivinyas ko upar se ek kinare se uthaata he jiske kaaran sara kaa sara upadraft ek urdhwadhar stambh ke rup main ghumta he
 Mesocyclones are normally relatively localized: they lie between the short scale and the micro scale

 The center of the storm is usually calm and is located in one place
 chakravaaton ke chah mukhya prakaar hai: dhruviya chakravaat, dhruviya kam, attirikt ushn katibandheey chakravaat, ant:ushn katibandheey chakravaat, ushnkaribandheey chakravaat or mesosainchlones 
 a polar low is a small-scale, short-lived low-pressure system found on ocean areas in front of the main polar front of both the northern and southern hemispheres
 yah pranali aamtaur par samaanaantar paimaane par kam dikhaai detii he or ek do din se zyada jivit nahin rah sakati he
 They are part of a larger class of mesoscale weather systems
 paaramparik mausam report se dhruviya kam kaa pataa lagaana kathin he or ucch akshansh prakriyaaon, jaise jahajrani, gas or tel platformon ke liye ek khatra hai
 Polar low is also referred to by other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, arctic storm, arctic low and cold air pressure
 Usually the term is reserved for more vigorous systems where at least 17 m is near - Surface winds
 1 An extratropical tropical cyclone is an abbreviated scale low-pressure weather system that has neither tropical nor any polar features, associated with a forward and parallel gradient in temperature and snow point, thus called a "baroclinic zone"
 is
 'attirikt ushnkaribandheey' shabd is tathy kaa nirupan karte he ki is prakaar ke chakravaat grah ke katibandhon ke baahar, madhya akshanshon ke bich hote hai
 These systems are reported as 'mid latitude cyclones' due to their regional formation or post-tropical cyclones, where extra-tropical transition occurs and is often 'low' or 'low' by earlier weather forecasters and the general public
 Pressure 'is described
 ye har rose kii ghatnaayen hai, jo virdohi chakravaaton ke saath, dharti ke adhiktar hisse ke mausam ko banaati hai
 However, extra-tropical cyclones are almost always called baroclinic, as they remain with the western air temperature and snowflake regions and sometimes become barotropic when the temperature distribution near the cyclone is uniform with radius
 is
 ek atirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ek upkatibandheey tufaan main or vahaan se ek antah ushnkaribandheey chakravaat main parinat ho jaataa he agar yah garm pani ke upar rahata he or jo apni mul garmi ko kendriya sanvahan main viksit karata he
 An intramuscular cyclone is a weather system with some characteristics of tropical cyclones and some additional tropical cyclones
 ye bumadhya rekha or 50 wein samanaantar ke bich ban sakate hai
 Since the 1950s, astronomers did not understand whether to call it a tropical cyclone or a more tropical cyclone
 That is why they were called tropical equatorial and semi-tropical, which were also called hybrid cyclones, until 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this cyclone class
 antah ushn katibandheey chakravaaton ko 2002 se atlantic basin se sarkari ushnkaribandheey chakravaat suchi se naam praapt hone lage
 They have a broad wind pattern, which can hold maximum air that is located farther from the center than tropical cyclones, and is found at temperatures ranging from weak to mid-level
 kyonki ye adhik katibandhon vaale chakravaaton se banate hai, jinka taapmaana anya kati bandhon se thanda hota he, unke gathan ke liye prayukt samudr ke sataha kaa taapmaana ushnkaribandheey chakravaat dahalij kii tulana main teen degree celsius, yaa paanch degree pheranheit se kam hota he jo, 23 degree celsius ke aasapaas hota hai
 This suggests that intertropical cyclones form outside the conventional boundary in stormy weather
 yadhyapi ant:ushnkaribandheey tufaanon main kabhi-kabhaar hi tufaani hawaaon kaa dabaav hota he, ve prakrutit: ushnkaribandheey ho sakate he yadi unke satv garm ho jaaen to 
 a tropical cyclone is a storm system, which is a low pressure center and produces thunderstorms, strong winds and high rainfall
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat, tab banataa he jab nam hawa se garmi nikalati he, jiske parinamswaroop nam hawa main nihit bashp jari ho jaataa he
 These are formed by different heat components and are called other cyclonic storms, such as nor'easters, European windstorms, polar less, storm systems
 yah shabd 'ushnkaribandheey' donon bhugolic roopon ko suchit karata he, jo anany rup se globe ke ushnkaribandheey kshetron main paye jate he or samudri hawa, ushnkaribandheey hawa samoohon main banati he
 The term 'cyclone' refers to a cyclonic cyclone by nature, which rotates in the northern hemisphere, in the Uttaravarat and in the southern hemisphere
 sthaan or shakti ke aadhaar par ushnkaribandheey chakravaato ko anya naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he, jaise tufaan, aandhi, ushnkaribandheey tufaan, chakravaati toofaan, ushnkaribandheey dabaav, yaa keval chakravaat
}saamanyatya, ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ko atlantic basin or prashanth mahaasaagar main tufaan kaha jaataa he
 Although tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rains, they are also capable of producing high waves and destructive storms
 ve garm pani ke bade nikaayon par viksit hoti he or jameen ke uppar hilne se unki takat kam ho jati he
 For this reason, tropical storms can cause considerable damage to coastal areas, while inland areas are relatively safe from them
 baari varsha tathaapi, antardeshiy kshetron main baadh kii sthiti utpann karte hai or tufaani tarange samudr tat ke upar vyapak tateey baadh kii sthiti paidaa karte hai
 Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones can provide relief from drought conditions
 ve katibandhon se garmi or urja ko uthaakar shitoshna akshansh kii ore le jaataa he, jiske kaaran ye vaishvik vaataavaran parisancharan tantra kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa ban jate he
 As a result, tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth's atmosphere, keeping temperatures around the world relatively stable and warm
 kai ushnkaribandheey chakravaat us samay viksit hote hai jab vaataavaran main ek kamjor uthal-puthal ke saath vaataavaran kii sthiti anukool hoti he
 Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics
 ushnkaribandheey pranaliyaan tab bahati hawaaon ke saath shobhamandal main chali jaati he ; yadi sthiti anukool ho to, ushnkaribandh ashaant ho jaataa he or phir vahaan ek centre viksit ho jaataa he
 At the other end of the spectrum, if conditions around the system deteriorate or tropical cyclones make landfall, the system weakens and eventually collapses
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat attirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaat tab ban jaataa he jab vah ucch akshansh kii ore badhata he agar isaki urja kaa mul sankshepan dwaara jari kii gai ho to vah garmi se badal kar hawa raashiyon ke bich vaataavaran main badal jaataa he; ek kriyasheel drushti se kaha ja saktaa he ki, ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat apane atirikt sankraman ke dauraan ant: ushnkaribandheey nahin banataa 
 Mesocyclone is a vortex of air, contained in a diameter of about 2 km and 10 km closed storm
 hawa uthati he or ek hi urdhwadhar dhuree, ek hi disha main gumti he jaise kisi bhi golarddh main kam dabaav vaali pranali main gumti he
 They are often stormy, meaning they are associated with a localized low pressure area
 is tarah ke tufaano se sataha par prachand hawaaen chalati hai or ole padate hai
 Mensocyclones are often found together with infestations in the upper cell, where they can become blind

 According to the theory of wave-particle duality or wave-particle duality, all substances have both particle and wave characteristics
 aadhunik bhautikee ke kwantem yantriki kshetra kaa yah ek aadharbhoot siddhanth he
 At the level at which the senses of humans perceive the world, at that level any object is either a particle or a wave, but not both simultaneously
 parmaanuon ke bahut hi sookshm str par aisa nahin hota or yahan bhautikee samajhane ke liye paaya gaya ki vastuen or prakaash kabhi to kan kii prakruti dikhaati hai or kabhi tarang kii
 The situation is very unique at the moment
 kuch ghatnaon se to prakaash tarangamay prathit hota he or kuch se kanikamay
 Probably the truth is dual
 rupe ke donon prishthon kii tarah, prakaash ke bhi do vibhinn rup hai
 But both are true
 aisa hi dwait dravya ke sambandh main bhi paaya gaya he
 It also sometimes appears waveful and sometimes granular
 na to prakaash ke ore na dravya ke donon rup ek hi samay main ek hi saath dikhaai de sakate hai
 They are conflicting, but complementary forms
 pracheen unani darshanik arastu ne prakaash kii prakruti ke bare main apni soch prastut kii thi ki prakaash hawa main ek tarang-numa uttejnaa he 
 Another Greek thinker, Damocritus, took the opposite view that everything in the universe is made of particles and the same thing is short on light
 yah matbhed unnisvi sadi tak chalata rahaa
 One of the characteristics of waves is that when two or more pure waves collide, they form a pattern of diffraction
 thik yahi prakaash kii shashakt kirnon ke saath dekha gaya
 Although Sir Isaac Newton believed light to be made up of particles and tried his best to adopt his approach, gradually most scientists began to believe that the basic nature of light is waves
 unnisvi sadi main scotland ke vaigyanik james clerk maxwell ne chaar sameekaran khoj nikaale jo tarangon par aadhaarit the or jo prakaash kii prakruti ko puri tarah ujagar karte the
 After this, light began to appear as electromagnetic waves
 iske vipareet, jo parmaanuon par anusandhan ho rahaa tha, us se lagane laga ke parmaanu or uske chote ansh kan hi hai
 Concepts like atomic weight began to appear as if the atom is actually a particle in which there are only small particles inside
 unnisvi sadi main kai vaigyanik krishnika se utpann hone vaali vidyutchumbakeey vikiran kaa adhyayan kar rahe the or armbh main iskaa ganit main sahi praturup banane main asafal hote rahe
 It is seen in sounds and other waves that whenever waves are formed in an object, the wavelength of those waves depends on the open space in the object where those waves get an opportunity to form
 sangeet main prayog hone vaali bansuri se jo dhvaniyaan nikalati hai unka tarangadairghy bansuri ke mukh se lekar pehle khule chhed kii lambaai ke baraabar yaa phir us kaa hat hoti he
 There is a theory of thermodynamics that an object that is in thermal equilibrium, must have the same level of energy in every possible way to hold energy
 is adhyayan main kaale padaarth ko ushmiya santulan main liya gaya or, kyonki uske anant hat nikalate the, to laga ke urja bhi anant tarangadairdhyon main dikhni chahie or anant honi chahie
 But it was seen that there was nothing in electromagnetic energy emanating from dark matter
 1900 main german vaigyanik maiks plank ne is duvidha kaa tod niklaa
 He said that when electromagnetic energy falls on a molecule of black matter, it absorbs it and gets into an excited state
 jab vah paryaapt urja paa letaa he to us urja ko ek vidyutchumbakeey kiran ke rup main prasaarit karke waapas apni vishram kii sthiti main aa jaataa he
 He wrote e = hv in mathematics to the energy transmitted by the atom, in which e is energy, v is frequency and h is a constant
 unke kehane kaa matlab tha ke kaale padaarth kii urja kaa strot ushmiya santulan main sthit kaale padaarth ke andar kaa khulaa sthaan nahin balki kaale padaarth ke anu hai jo uttejnaa or vishram kii sthitiyon main aate-jate pehle to urja sokhte hai or phir use chhodte hai
 a larger frequency beam requires more energy and will be released only when its equivalent energy is absorbed
 plank kaa tarika lagaakar jab kaale padaarth se umadane vaali vidyutchumbakeey urja ko dekha gaya, to unhen bilkul thik paaya gaya
 This created panic, as it was immediately revealed that the electromagnetic energy being released by the excited molecules can also be seen as Kiransh
 abhi tak prakaash ko tarang mana jaataa tha
 Seeing the tendency of particles in it created confusion because it means that light is sometimes particle and sometimes wave
 yah dvirup plank swayan maanane ko taiyaar nahin the or unhone kaha ki haalanki unka siddhant thik baithta he, lekin unki ganit main kuch gadabad he
 The coming decades showed that there was no such mess
 prakaash vastav main tarang-kan kaa dvirup rakhata he
 Many scientists agreed with Planck, that light is only a wave and they started trying to find a new way to prove it
 albert oinstin ne is se bilkul vipareet kaam kiya
 He accepted that there is also a tendency for particles in the light and tried to solve an old issue with this truth
 1887 main hikerikh hertz naam ke ek german vaigyanik ne maaloom kiya tha ki jab bahut kam tarangadairghy kaa prakaash kuch dhaatuon or anya padaarthon par padataa he to bijli kaa bahaav paidaa hota he
 In 1901, Nikola Tesla showed that electricity is being produced because electrons are emitted spontaneously from this metal
 agle hi saal, 1902 main, philip lenard ne paaya ki prakaash agar bade tarangadairghy kaa ho to aisa nahin hota, chaahe roshni kitni hi adhik kyon na daali jaae, jabaki chote tarangadairghy vaale halaki roshni main bhi yah hota he
 This came to be called the lightning effect, and scientists failed to understand for many years why this happens and only from light with short wavelengths
 inastin ne plank ke siddhant ko lekar yah gutthi sulajhaa di
 He said that light can actually be seen as its particles
 prakaash ke har kan main plank ki bataai hui urja hoti he, yani E=hv
 There is an inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency - larger wavelength means that particles of light will have lower frequency and energy will also be lower according to Planck's law
 kam tarangadairghy kaa matlab he ke prakaash ke kanon main aavriti adhik hogi or plank niyam ke anusaar urja bhi adhik hogi
 He made some predictions based on this, which were found to be perfectly fine in the laboratory
 iske liye inastin ko 1921 main bhautikee kaa nobel puraskaar diya gaya
 Max Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, even before that, in 1918
 inastin kii khoj ke baad yah jhuthalaanaa asambhav ho gaya ke prakaash main kan or tarang donon kii pravritiyaan hai
 After 1925 particles of light came to be called foton and this name has now become popular
 inastin kii khoj or jeet ke baad, vaigyanikon ne dhire-dhire prakaash ke tarang-kan dvirup ko maananaa shuru kar diya tha, jab 1924 main francisi vaigyanik lui da broai ne bhautikee kii duniya main ek or sansani failaa di
 He said that not only light, but also all matter, wave-particles are twisted and any moving substance can be seen as a wave or particle
 unhone apane ganit se dikhaaya ke gatisheel kan kaa tarangadairghy uske samveg par nirbhar karata he - This is exactly what was found in experiments with electrons three years later
 yah parmaanuon ke ansh hote hai or inhen hameshaa kan samajha jaataa tha, lekin jab electron kiran poonj ek parade par phenki gayi to bilkul shashakt prakaash kii tarah inhon ne bhi tarangon vaale vivartan ke chitra dikhaa die
 For his discovery, The Broy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929
 1927 main german vaigyanik varnor hisenberg ne apana anischitata siddhanth prakashit kiya jisamen unhone kaha ke yah purna nischitata ke saath kabhi nahin kaha ja saktaa ke koi vastu kahan sthit he yaa us kii gati kya he
 He made it clear that this is not due to deficiency in any criterion, but only in nature
 jis tarah se kisi tarang ke bare main yah thik se nahin kaha ja saktaa ke vah kahan sthit he usee tarah se vastuon ke bare main bhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The smaller the object, the greater the uncertainty according to its size
 unhone ganit main ise aise likhaa - Where yah anischitata siddhanth jaldi hi kwantem yantriki kii niv kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa ban gaya or isamen bhi padaarthon ke tarang-kan dvirup kii pahchaan nihit he

 garbhantak vah padaarth he jo kii garbhpaat ko prerit karata he
 Abortions are performed with the help of medicines and also spontaneously
 sabase saadhaaran garbhantak jo chikitsa garbhpaat main istemaal kiye jate he ve myfapristone hote he
 Doctors are instrumental in providing abortions between 24 and 60 days of pregnancy
 us samay garbhpaat karaane se mahila ko zyada nuksaan nahin hota
 Apart from this, many drugs are also used for abortion which spontaneously causes abortion
 parantu aisi kinhi bhi aushadhi ke istemaal ke bare main kisi bhi sahitya main nahin likhaa hua he
 In the old times, these drugs were used for abortion
 sahaj rup se garbhpaat main istemaal hone vaali aushadhiyaan he: sharaab banane vaali surabhand, kadava tarbooz, nil kohosh, junglee gaajar, junglee pudinaa, papeeta, magavort aadi
 All these elements are used for the fetus
 rajasthan rajya vidhansabha chunaav, 1993 bhartiya rajya rajasthan main disambar 1993 ko hue the
 The result was declared in December 1993
 satarudh party bhaajapa ne congress ne haraa diya
 List of elected members of Rajasthan Legislative Assembly viksit deshon dwaara vikasshil deshon ke aantarik maamalon main pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se kiye jane vaale hastkshep ko nav-upniveshwaad kaha jaataa he
 Those who believe in the notion of neo-colonialism think that the economic structure that the colonial powers had maintained in the past is still being used to control those colonies
 europe ke deshon ne ek lambe samay tak asia or africa ke deshon par apana samrajyavaadee jaal phenkar unka raajnneetik va aarthik shoshan kiya lekin un deshon main ubharne vaale swatantrata aandolanon ne samrajyavaadee deshon ke manasuubon par pani pher diya
 Gradually, the countries of Asia and Africa started getting rid of imperialist clutches one by one
 jab samrajyavaadee shaktiyon ko apane din ladate najar aae to unhone aupniveshik shoshan ke nae nae tareeke talashne shuru kar die
 They resorted to economic imperialism in the process to maintain their dominance over those countries
 swatantra hone ke baad navdith raashtra is sthiti main nahi rahe ki ve apana swatantra aarthik vikaas kar saken
 In the name of helping in their economic development, the developed imperialist countries used dollar diplomacy to establish their control over their economies and gradually they got caught in the web of new imperialism so much that even today they remained under developed countries
 Huh
 is vyavastha ko nav-upniveshwaad ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This is a new concept
 iskaa prayog nae prakaar ke samrajyavad ke liye kiya jaataa he
 It is also known by the names 'dollar imperialism', 'economic imperialism', 'new-imperialism' etc
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad adhiktar paradheen raashtra raajnneetik rup se to swatantra ho gaye lekin phir bhi apratyaksh rup se kisi na kisi tarah samrajyavad kaa shikaar bane rahe
 His position is called modern imperialism or neo-colonialism
 yah ek aisi vyavastha he jo ek shaktishaalee viksit raashtra yaa apekshaakrit kam shaktishaalee raashtra kaa sambandh ek aarthik yaa upgrah upnivesh ko darshaati he
 Multinational corporations are its primary means
 inkaa uddeshy aarthik rup se paradheen yaa upgrah upnivesh kaa adhik se adhik shoshan karke us par apana varchasv banaae rakhana he
 President Sukarno had said in the Bandung Conference in 1955 that it is a new veneer of colonialism in the form of economic control, intellectual control and actual physical control by a small foreign community within the nation
 uskaa spasht ishaara bahurashtriya nigamon kii badhati bhoomika kii taraf tha
 Today, developed countries are resorting to these to tighten their imperialist gripes
 inke dwaara nirdhan deshon ke kachche maal par niyantran puunji niryaat va aasaan vinimay daron ke naam par dimak kii tarah ghuskar kiya ja rahaa he taaki ve desh kachche maal kii purti tathaa taiyaar maal kii bikri kaa kendra ban jaaen
 Thus it can be said that neo-colonialism is a process of imperialist control which developed nations use to economically exploit the newly developed Least developed nations
 ye raashtra raajnneetik rup se to swatantra hote hai, lekin aarthik sahaayta, sainik sahaayta, shastron kii sahaayta, takneekee gyaan, utpaadan ke kshetra main viksit deshon ke upar hi ashrith hote hai
 Their dependence on developed countries increases so much that they do not remain independent even indirectly politically
 argenski ne upniveshwaad ke teen roopon - raajnneetik upniveshwaad, aarthik drushti se paradheen desh tathaa pichhalggu desh kaa varnan kiya he
 In the modern era, all countries have become independent politically
 isliye iskaa koi mahatv nahin rah gaya he
 He includes the last two under neo-colonialism
 ye desh raajnneetik rup se to swatantra hote hai lekin aarthik sahaayta ke liye viksit rashtron kii ore dekhte hai
 Economic backwardness is found in these countries
 logon kii nirdhantaa va asthir raajnneetik vyavasthaaen iske suchak hai
 People's personal income and national income are only nominal
 asia va africa ke navdith swatantra raashtra is shrenee main shaamil hue
 They depended on foreign aid for economic development for a long time
 unamem se adhiktar aaj bhi aarthik rup se paradheen rashtron kii shrenee main aate hai
 Developed countries have established their production units in these countries by putting more and more capital
 kai deshon main to yah nivesh 80 pratishat tak he
 These countries also have the potential to influence the political life of the dependent nations
 aise deshon ko aarthik parashrith upnivesh kaha jaataa he
 The spread of dollar imperialism policy by America in countries of Pakistan, Thailand, Ghana etc
 Asia and Africa is only a part of this type of colonialism
 yah ek aisa raashtra hota he jo aupchaarik rup se to swatantra hota he lekin raajnneetik va aarthik drushti se kisi videshi shakti ke adheen hota he
 Those countries are not able to follow independent foreign policy
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad anek deshon main soviet sangh ke niyantran vaali samyavaadee sarkarein sthapit hui
 All those countries used to fall under the category of hanger countries or satellite colonies
 aaj afghanistan main america samarthit sarkaar he
 Therefore Afghanistan is the hanger country of America
 aavashyaktaa padane par pichhalggu deshon ko anek aakaaon dwaara sainik sahaayta bhi uplabdh karai jaati he
 After the Second World War, both the superpowers helped their hanger countries in every way
 aarthik rup se parashrith deshon kii tulana main in upniveshon kii sthiti adhik kharaab hoti he
 As the Second World War approached, imperialist powers became so much weaker that they were disqualified from maintaining their imperialist control over the subjugated nations
 saath main paradheen deshon main nirantar ubhar rahi raajnneetik chetana ke parinamswaroop ubhare swatantrata aandolan ne bhi samrajyavaadee shaktiyon ko bahut haani pahunchaai
 The two world wars caused great damage to the economies of imperialist countries
 ve ab is sthiti main nahin rahe ki aandolankaaree takaton se loha le saken
 Hence they loosened their imperialist control and ended colonial rule
 lekin iske baad ek nae prakaar ke samrajyavad kaa janm hua jise nav-upniveshwaad yaa aarthik samrajyavad ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It was an important part of the efforts made by developed imperialist countries to get their fragmented economies back on track
 samrajyavaadee takatein chaahati thi ki aarthik niyantran dwaara ve navdith swatantra rashtron ke aarthik jivan par apana niyantran ladakar unase pehle jaisaa hi laabh uthaa sakati hai
 Following are the reasons for its birth - dhire-dhire aupniveshik shoshan ke shikaar deshon main raajnneetik chetana kaa udai hua
 This led to a rapid development of the freedom movement there
 bharat jaise rashtriya mukti aandolan ne aupniveshik takaton ko yah ahsaas kara diya ki ab unka niyantran zyada din tak nahin tik saktaa
 The right to self-determination was approved in the Charter of the United Nations
 isliye samay kii najukta ko dekhakar unhen apni upniveshon ko swatantra karnaa padaa
 But the political instability of those countries gave these countries a chance to establish their economic control
 isse purana upniveshwaad nae rup main parivartit ho gaya
 The two world wars caused terrible damage to the imperialist forces of Europe
 ab upniveshon main shashan chalaanaa unke samarthy se baahar ho gaya
 The successive liberation movements also destroyed large empires
 bharat main england ko jo haani uthaani padi, usase bhaybheet hokar angrejon ne yaha par apana aupniveshik shashan jari rakhane main asamarthta jaahir kii
 The newly sovereign states began to influence international relations
 1949 main china ek samyavaadee shakti ke rup main ubhara
 Now it became difficult for the imperialist forces to remain there
 maao ne sabhi samrajyavaadee takaton ko bhayankar parinaam kii chetavanee de daali
 But not all the budding nations were as powerful as China and India
 adhiktar deshon main apane aarthik vikaas kaa samarthy nahin tha
 Therefore he expressed his desire to depend only on his old moneylenders
 sabhi samrajyavaadee takatein aarthik sahaayta ke naam par apane adheen rahe deshon main hastkshep ke prayaas karne lagi
 This gave birth to neo-colonialism there
 sabhi navdith swatantra rashtron apane aarthik vikaas ke liye videshi aarthik madad kii aavashyaktaa anubhav hui
 The imperialist countries had exploited the economic resources of most of the countries which had been victims of colonial rule for a long time
 in navdith rashtron ke paas apane aarthik vikaas ke liye na to paryaapt puunji thi or na hi takneekee gyaan, apane aarthik vikaas ke lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye in deshon ko puraani upniveshi takaton se karj lene par majaboor kar diya
 This enabled the old colonial forces to re-establish their net in these countries and new colonialism was born
 do vishwa yudhon ne samrajyavaadee takaton ko bahut zyada aarthik haani pahunchaai
 With the end of colonial rule, the sources of their raw materials and finished goods were sold
 isse samrajyavaadee deshon ko yah aavashyaktaa mahasoos hui ki navdith swatantra rashtron main mandiyon kii khoj va kachche maal ko praapt karne ke liye kya kiya jaae
 At such a time, the idea of taking advantage of the economic compulsions of the budding nations came to his mind
 isliye unhone aarthik sahaayta ke naam par in deshon main hastkshep karnaa shuru kar diya or dhire-dhire vahaan nav-upniveshvaadi shashan kii sthapana ke prayaas kiye jisase vahaan par nav-upniveshwaad kii dharna astitv main ai
 This system helped in fulfilling all the wishes of the imperial forces
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad america or soviet sangh main sheet-yuddh armbh ho gaya
 The two superpowers decided to include new nations into their groups to strengthen their positions
 videshi sahaayta, shastr purti, bahurashtriya nigamon par niyantran aadi sadhano dwaara in mahashaktiyon ne navdith swatantra rashtron ko aarthik rup se apane niyantran main le liya
 This led to an increase in the number of satellite states
 unki sabhi aarthik nitiyaan ek-ek karke nav-upniveshwaad ko majboot aadhaar pradaan karne ke liye hi thi
 Even today, developed nations like the US are strengthening their neo-colonial control through multinational corporations
 dhani va shaktishaalee samrajyavaadee raashtra apane aarthik hiton ko puraa karne ke liye navdith swatantra rashtron main apane niyantran ke alag alag tareeke apanaate hai
 Their main goal is to establish their new imperialist control over the underdeveloped countries
 iske liye unke dwaara apanaae gaye saadhan nimnlikhit hai- a network of multinational corporations has been laid by all the rich countries to control the economic and industrial units in all parts of the world
 apni aarthik shakti va kaaryakshetra main vrihata ke kaaran ye apane kshetradhikaar main aane vaale sabhi deshon main apni manamaani karne lagate hai
 Their aim is to earn maximum profit
 vikasshil deshon main ye bahurashtriya companiyaan pratyaksh puunji nivesh karke poonjivadi deshon ke liye kaccha maal tathaa praathmik utpaadan kii purti kii garanti dete hai
 They invest most in the field of primary production and raw materials
 ye jivan main moolbhoot aavashyaktaaon kii vastuon ke nivesh main sarvaadhik munafa dekhte hai
 In developing countries, there is more profit from capital investment due to cheap labor, raw materials and intensity of exploitation
 1996 main bharat main 741 videshi companiyon ne nivesh kar rakhaa tha
 Even in a developing country like India, these companies get manifold benefits
 apni puunji kii suraksha ke liye ye nigam apane niyantran vaale deshon ke aantarik maamalon main bhi hastkshep karte hai
 These companies are working to monopolize international capital trade, commerce and production and distribution abroad
 asia, africa tathaa latin america ke deshon par inkaa puraa niyantran he
 Companies like IBM, GEC and Standard Oil are reaping considerable profits from these countries
 apane munaafe kii dar ko adhik se adhik oonche str par le jane ke liye ye apane adheen rashtron ke raajnneetik hastkshep karne se bhi nahin chookte
 Thus multinational corporations are the most powerful instruments of neo-colonialism and have the full support of all developed nations
 navdith swatantra raashtra apane aarthik vikaas ke liye purna rup se videshi sahaayta va samrajyavaadee karj par hi nirbhar hai
 Under the guise of their debt and in the name of foreign aid, developed nations force these countries to accept arbitrary conditions
 inhen karj lete samay anek kathor sharten bhi manani padati he
 The debt of these countries is increasing day by day
 niryaat se praapt aay kaa adhiktar hissaa samrajyavaadee karj kaa byaaj chukaane main lag jaataa he or bhugtan santulan kaa ghaataa nirantar badhata hi jaataa he
 They have to use this loan amount to buy goods from multinational companies only
 unhen vyapaar avarodhon ko samaapt karne kii sharten bhi manani padati he
 All conditions contribute to the interests of the capital investing countries
 videshi sahaayta praapt karne vaale desh ko sadaiv niveshak yaa sahaayta pradaan karne vaale desh ke hiton main vruddhi karne ke liye apni arthvyavastha main moolbhoot parivartan karne padate hai
 Gradually, the dependence of developing countries on imperialist debt and foreign aid keeps increasing
 alp viksit yaa pichde hue deshon kii haalat to vikasshil deshon se bhi badtar hoti he
 Thus it can be said that in the race for foreign aid and imperialist debt, developed countries are nurturing neo-colonialism
 aaj ke aanvik yug main prayek raashtra apane ko sainik va samrik drushti se surakshit dekhnaa chahta he
 For this, they have to buy weapons from developed countries
 aarthik rup se kamjor hone ke kaaran ye desh kai baar karja bhi lete hai
 Today most of the national income of developing countries is being spent on purchasing arms
 mahashaktiyon dwaara kiya jane vaala shakti pradarshan shastr pratispardhaa ko badhaava detaa he
 In 1979, the confrontation of the superpowers reached abroad and brought substantial benefits
 in mahashaktiyon dwaara dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad kiye gaye shakti pradarshan inke shastr udyog main ai mandi ko kam karne main sahaayak siddh hue
 Today, most countries of the third world buy arms only from America, France, Britain and Soviet Union
 apni aupniveshik sthiti ko majboot banane ke liye samrajyavaadee deshon ne teesri duniya ke deshon main apane sainik adde khol rakhe hai
 These countries are promoting neo-colonialism as a supply of weapons
 aaj vishwa bank, antarrashtriya mudra kosh jaisi antarrashtriya sansthaaen antarrashtriya arthvyavastha kaa sanchaalan kar rahi hai
 These institutions nurture neo-colonialism by imposing strict conditions while giving loans
 deshon ko diya jane vaala rin hameshaa raajnneetik pratibandhon par aadhaarit hota he
 It is always responsible for the interests of developed nations
 isiilie tritiy vishwa ke desh nai antarrashtriya arthvyavastha kii purajor maang karte rahete hai
 They allege that the world's economic institutions are going to nurture imperialist interests
 ye nirantar pichde hue yaa vikasshil deshon ke aarthik va raajnneetik hiton par kutharaghaat karti hai
 In this way they are promoting a new form of colonialism
 samrajyavaadee shaktiyaan aarthik sahaayta dekar pichde rashtron ko nirantar kamjor karti rahati he
 The total interference of the imperialist or investing country in its economic and political life increases
 videshi takat ashrith desh ke vyapaar par apana purna niyantran rakhti he to unka niyantran dhire-dhire sthaayee rup praapt kar letaa he or yah nirbharta nirantar badhati hi rahati he or vah ant main upgrahi rajya kaa rup le letaa he
 Now the imperialist power shifts its attention towards the political sector rather than the economic sector
 isse upgrahi raashtra ko apane aakaa kii har baat maanane ke liye baadhya hona padataa he
 Prior to 1990, the Soviet Union had openly used this type of policy
 iske peeche nav-upniveshwaad ke prasar kii hi bhaavana vidyaman rahati he
 Thus, it can be said that even today, in the form of neo-colonialism, developed nations continue to dominate the underdeveloped and developing countries
 dakshin ke garib desh nirantar nav-upniveshwaad ke shoshan kaa shikaar ho rahe hai
 Developed countries of the north are strengthening their hold on these countries through multinational corporations and international economic institutions
 bahurashtriya companiyaan vikasshil va pichde deshon main dimak kii tarah ghus rahi hai
 It is also able to influence political behavior in most countries
 apane hiton kii purti ke liye viksit raashtra saanskrithik samrajyavad kaa bhi sahaara le rahe hai
 After the end of the Cold War, the United States is rapidly developing its economic or dollar imperialism in the world
 vah aarthik jivan ke saath-saath vikasshil va pichde tritiy vishwa ke deshon ke raajnneetik kriya-kalapon main bhi hastkshep karne laga he
 If its emerging neo-colonialism is not stopped, a new threat will arise for the whole world
 aaj tritiy vishwa ke deshon ko ekajute hokar nav-upniveshwaad kii jaden ukhaadne kii jarurat he taaki nai antarrashtriya arthvyavastha kii sthapana ho sake

 Crime or conviction is defined in different forms; As such, in paribhaashaon ke anusaar kisi nagarpalika ke banaae niyamon kaa ulanghan kar yadi koi raat main bina batti jalaae cycle par nagar kii sadak par chale athwa bina paryaapt kaaran ke train kii zanjeer khinchakar gaadi khadi kar de, to vah bhi usee prakaar doshi mana jayega, jis tarah koi kisi kii hatya karne par

 For the perfection of the crime of theft, it is necessary to touch the things of others at least
