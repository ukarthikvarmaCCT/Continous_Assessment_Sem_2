 He did not return to Kerala again and settled in Magadha
 is prakaar ke vichaar rakhane vaale vidwaan use kerala ke kutullur namputree vansh kaa vanshaj maanate hai
 Many scholars consider him a native of Magadha

 It is difficult to say with certainty where Kautilya's birthplace is because of the extreme differences, but based on many references it would be okay to consider Taxila as his birthplace
 ve
 ke
 subramanyam ne kaha he ki kai sandarbhon main is baat kaa ullekh miltaa he ki sikandar ko apane akraman ke abhiyaan main yuva kautilya se bhent hui thi
 Since Alexander's invasion was mostly in the Taxila region, it is expected that Kautilya's birthplace would have been in the Taxila region
 kautilya ke pita kaa naam chanak tha
 He was a poor Brahmin and lived in some way
 atah spasht he ki kautilya kaa bachapan garibi or dikkaton main gujara hoga
 There is no specific reference to Kautilya's initiation, but his intelligence and his scholarship are reflected in his thoughts
 vah kurup hote hue bhi shaareerik rup se balishtha tha
 An overview of his book 'arthashastra' gives a complete sense of his talent, his multi-faceted personality and foresight
 kautilya ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki vah bada hi swabhimani evam krodhi swabhaav kaa vyakti tha
 According to a legend, once King Mahananda of Magadha humiliated Kautilya on the occasion of Shraddha
 kautilya ne krodh ke vasheebhoot hokar apni shikha kholkar yah pratigya kii thi ki jab tak vah nandavansh kaa naash nahin kar degaa tab tak vah apni shikha nahin baandhenga
 This was also a major reason for Kautilya's entry into practical politics
 nandavansh ke vinaash ke baad usne chandragupta maury ko rajgaddi par baithne main har sambhav sahaayta kii
 After Chandragupta Maurya ascended the throne, he entered into practical politics with the aim of making him mighty and expanding the Mauryan Empire
 vah chandragupta maury kaa mantri bhi bana
 Many scholars have stated that Kautilya has nowhere said anything in his composition regarding the Mauryan dynasty or his ministry, but most sources have confirmed this fact
 'arthshaastra' main kautilya ne jis vijigishu raja kaa chithran prastut kiya he, nishchit rup se vah chandragupta maury ke liye hi sambodhit kiya gaya he
 Overwhelmed by the defeat of small states due to Alexander's invasion of India, Kautilya resolved to enter practical politics
 uski sarvopari ichha thi bharat ko ek gauravshaalee or vishaal rajya ke rup main dekhnaa
 Certainly Chandragupta Maurya was the focal point of his desire
 acharya kautilya ko ek ore paarangat or doordarshee raajnneetijna ke rup main maury samrajya kaa sansthaapak or sangrakshak mana jaataa he, to duusari ore use samskruti sahitya ke itihaas main apni athulaneey evam adbhut kriti ke kaaran apane vishay kaa ekmaatr vidwaan hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 Kautilya's wisdom, dexterity and foresight is well known in the scriptures, poems and other texts of India
 kautilya dwaara nandavansh kaa vinaash or mauryvansh kii sthapana se sambandhit katha vishnu puraana main aati he
 Despite being a great scholar and general secretary of the Maurya Empire, Kautilya's life was a life of simplicity
 vah 'sada jivan ucch vichaar' kaa sahi pratik tha
 He led a very simple life during his tenure as a minister
 vah ek chota-se makaan main rahata tha or kaha jaataa he ki uske makaan kii deevaaron par gobar ke upale thope rahete the
 He believed that a king or a minister with his character and high ideals could present a model to the people
 usne sadaiv maryaadaaon kaa paalan kiya or karmthata kii jindagi bitaayi
 Later, he is said to have renounced his ministerial career and led a Vanaprastha life
 vastutah use dhan, yash or pad kaa koi lobh nahin tha
 In essence, he was a 'vitiragi', 'ascetic, man of hard work and dignity, whose life is still exemplary
 ek prakand vidwaan tathaa ek gambhir chintak ke rup main kautilya to vikhyath he hi, ek vyaavhaarik evam chatur raajnneetijna ke rup main bhi use khyaati mili he
 He has a historical contribution in the destruction of the Nanda dynasty and the establishment and expansion of the Magadha Empire
 salator ke kathananusaar pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik chintan main kautilya kaa sarvopari sthaan he
 Like Machiavelli, Kautilya has also attempted to separate politics from morality and study it as an independent scripture
 jaisaa ki kaahaa jaataa ha Kautilya's name, date of birth and birthplace have all been the subject of controversy
 kautilya ke naam ke sambandh main vidwaanon ke bich matbhed paaya jaataa he
 The first translator of Kautilya's 'arthashastra', Pandit Shamashastri, has used the name Kautilya
 'kautilya naam' kii pramanikta ko siddh karne ke liye pandit shaamasasthri ne vishnu-puraana kaa hawala diya he jisamen kaha gaya he— a controversy has arisen in this regard and that of Kautilya and Kautilya
 ganpati shastri ne 'kautilya' ke sthaan par 'kautaly' ko zyada pramanik mana he
 According to him, the name Kautalya appears to be correct and consistent due to being a Kutla gotra
 kaamandakeey nitishastra ke antargat kaha gaya he— Sambasiva Shastri has said that Ganapathi Shastri probably used the name Kautilya, considering Kautilya to be a descendant of the ancient saint Kutla, but there is no evidence that Kautilya was of the clan and clan of saint Kutal
 'kotilya' or 'kautaly' naam kaa vivaad or bhi kai vidwaanon ne uthaaya he
 V
A
 Ramaswamy has supported the statement of Ganapathi Shastri
 aadhunik vidwaanon ne donon naamon kaa prayog kiya he
 Western scholars have not given much importance to the controversy between Kautilya and Kautilya
 unke matanusaar is prakaar kii bhranti hijje ke her-pher ke kaaran ho sakati he
 Most Western writers have used the name Kautilya
 bharat main vidwaanon ne donon naamon kaa prayog kiya he, balki zyaadaatar kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Radhakanth's statement in this regard is also particularly notable
 usne apni rachana 'shabdakalpadram' main kaha he Many more names of Kautilya are mentioned
 jisamen chanakya naam prasiddh he
 Many scholars who have called Kautilya as Chanakya are of the opinion that he was called Chanakya because he was the son of Chanak
 duusari ore kuch vidwaanon ke kathananusaar uskaa janm punjab ke chanak kshetra main hua tha, isliye use chanakya kaha gaya he, yadhyapi is sambandh main koi spasht pramaan nahin miltaa he
 One thing is clear that Kautilya and Chanakya are the same person
 uparyukt naamon ke alaava uske or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh miltaa he, jaise vishnugupt
 It is said that his original name was Vishnugupta
 uske pita ne uskaa naam vishnugupt hi rakhaa tha
 Kautilya, Chanakya and Vishnugupta find many references related to the three names, but apart from these three names many other names are mentioned, such as Vatsyayan, Malang, Dravimal, Angul, Varanak, Katyan etc
 Which is the correct name and which is the wrong name, it is a matter of controversy
 parantu adhikansh paashchaatya or bhartiya vidwaanon ne 'arthshaastra' ke lekhak ke rup main kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Some Western scholars have put a question mark on the existence of Kautilya
 vinternij, jolly or kith ke matanusaar kautilya naam pratikatmak he, jo kootneeti kaa pratik he
 His views are supported by Kantilya's absence in his epics by Pantajali
 jolly ne to yahan tak kah daalaa he ki 'arthshaastra' kisi kautilya naamak vyakti kii kriti nahin he
 This is a text composed by another Pandit or Acharya
 shaamasasthri or ganapatishastri donon ne hi paashchaatya vichaarkon ke mat kaa khandan kiya he
 Both of them are convinced that Kautilya had complete existence, even if there is a difference in his names
 vastutah in teenon paashchaatya vidwaanon ke dwaara kautilya kaa astitv ko nakaarne ke liye jo bindu uthaae gaye hai, ve anargal evam mahatvaheen hai
 Western scholars say that Kautilya has not mentioned anywhere that he was an Amatya or a minister during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya, hence the writing of that 'arthashastra' cannot be considered
 yah bachakaana tark he
 It is clear from many references to Kautilya that he, with the help of Chandragupta Maurya, destroyed the Nanda dynasty and established the Maurya Empire
 kautilya kii kritiyon ke sambandh main bhi kai vidwaanon ke bich matbhed paaya jaataa he
 There is no definite information available regarding how many works of Kautilya are there
 kautilya kii sabase mahatpurna kriti arthshaastra kii charchaa sarvatra milti he, kintu anya rachanaaon ke sambandh main kuch vishesh ullekh nahin miltaa he
 Kamandaka, a disciple of Chanakya, has written in his treatise called 'nitisara' that Vishnugupta Chanakya extracted the nectar of ethics by churning the Mahomedi of economics from his intellect
 chanakya kaa 'arthshaastra' sanskrit main raajnneeti vishay par ek vilakshan granth he
 Shlokas of its policy are prevalent from house to house
 peeche se logon ne inke niti granthon se gata badhaakar vriddhchanakya, laghuchankya, bodhichanakya aadi kai nitigranth sankalit kar liye
 Chanakya was a scholar of all subjects
 'vishnugupt siddhant' naamak inkaa ek jyotish kaa granth bhi miltaa he
 It is said that he also has a book on Ayurveda called 'vaidyajivan'
 nyaay bhashyakaar vatsyayan or chanakya ko koi koi ek hi maanate hai, par yah bhram he jiskaa mul hemchand kaa yah shloke he: Thus the name of Kautilya has been associated with compositions called Dhatukautilya and Rajneeti
 kuch vidwaanon kaa yah maananaa he ki 'arthshaastra' ke alaava yadi kautilya kii anya rachanaaon kaa ullekh miltaa he, to vah kautilya kii sukhtiyon or kathanon kaa sankalan ho saktaa he
 Kautilya did not say anything explicitly about the origin of the state, but a few coincidental observations make it clear that he was in favor of a social settlement in place of the divine doctrine of the state
 hobbs, lock tathaa ruso kii tarah rajya kii utpatti se purv kii prakritik dasha ko vah araajaktaa kii sangya detaa he
 The state was born when, fed up with the law of 'fishery justice', people chose Manu as their king and agreed to give him one-sixth of their agricultural produce and one-tenth of gold
 iske badale main raja ne unki suraksha tathaa kalyaan kaa uttardaayitv sambhaala
 Kautilya is in favor of the monarchy
 kautilya ne paashchaatya raajnneetik chintakon dwaara pratipaadit rajya ke chaar aavashyak tattvon - bhoomi, jansankhya, sarkaar va samprabhutaa kaa vivaran na dekar rajya ke saat tattvon kaa vivechan kiya he
 In this regard, he does not give a definition of the state, but supports the already existing weekly theory
 kautilya ne rajya kii tulana maanav-sharir se kii he tathaa uske savyav rup ko sweekaar kiya he
 All the elements of the state work like organs of the human body inter-related, interdependent and together
 jansankhya main krishakon, udhyamiyon tathaa aarthik utpaadan main yogadan dene vaali praja sammilit he
 People should be loyal, hardworking and obeying the king's orders
 is prakaar kautilya kaa saptang siddhant rajya ke savyav swaroop kaa nirupan karte hue sabhi ango kii mahatvapurn bhoomika par prakaash daalata he
 Although this theory does not match the modern definition of the state, Kautilya's kingdom has all four elements of the modern state
 janapad bhoomi va jansankhya he, amaatya sarkaar kaa bhav he tathaa swami samprabhutta kaa pratik he
 The importance of the fund is in the administration, development and promotion and the army is necessary for internal peacekeeping and external security
 videshi maamalon main mitra mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he, kintu durg kaa sthaan aadhunik yug main suraksha-pratiraksha ke anya upkarnon ne le liya he
 Following the ancient Indian political thought, Kautilya has also made the concept of monarchy the center of his thinking
 vah loukik maamalon main raja kii shakti ko sarvopari maanata he, parantu karttavyon ke maamalon main vah swayan dharm main bandhaa he
 He is not a lecturer of religion, but a protector
 kautilya ne rajya ko apane aap main saadhy maanate hue saamaajik jivan main use sarvocch sthaan diya he
 The interest of the state is paramount for which at times it even outpaces the principles of morality
 kautilya ke anusaar rajya kaa uddeshy keval shaanti-vyavastha tathaa suraksha sthapit karnaa nahin, varan vyakti ke sarvocch vikaas main yogadan dena he
 According to Kautilya the functions of the state are- vahya shatruon tathaa akramanakariyon se rajya ko surakshit rakhana, aantarik vyavastha nyaay kii raksha tathaa daivi vipattiyon- baadh, bukamp, durbhiksh, aag, mahamari, ghaatak jantuon se praja kii raksha raja ke kaary hai
 Varnashrama Dharma has been emphasized under Swadharma
 yadhyapi kautilya manu kii tarah dharm ko sarvopari maanakar rajya ko dharm ke adheen nahin karata, kintu praja dwaara dharm kaa paalan na kiye jane par raja dharm kaa sangrakshan karata he
 The duty of the king is to establish social justice for the general public
 saamaajik vyavastha kaa samuchit sanchaalan tabhi sanmbhav he, jabaki pita-putr, pati-patni, guru-shishy aadi apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah karen
 In the event of divorce, he emphasizes equal rights of men and women
 strivadh tathaa brahman-hatya ko gambheer aparaadh mana gaya he
 The scope of Kautilya's kingdom is very wide
 vah rajya ko maanav ke bahumukhi vikaas kaa daayitv saunpkar use aadhunik yug kaa kalyankari rajya bana detaa he
 He has given many tasks to the state
 jaise- band, talab va sinchai ke anya sadhano kaa nirmaan, khaanon kaa vikaas, banjar bhoomi kii jutai, pashupaalan, vanyavikas aadi
 Apart from these, public entertainment was under the control of the state
 anathon nirdhanon, apango kii sahaayta, stri sammaan kii raksha, punakhravvaah kii vyavastha aadi bhi rajya ke daayitv the
 Thus Kautilya's kingdom is the ubiquitous state
 jan-kalyaan tathaa achche prashasan kii sthapana uskaa lakshya he, jisamen dharm va naitikta kaa prayog ek saadhan ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Kautilya says, ek anya sthaan par usne likhaa he
 In this regard, Salletore's statement is, "the only purpose of the state which has power and authority is to increase the happiness of its subjects
" is prakaar kautilya ne ek kalyankari rajya ke kaaryon ko uchit rup main nirdeshit kiya he
 '' kautilya ne na keval rajya ke aantarik kaary, balki vahya kaaryon kii bhi vistaar se charchaa kii he
 In this regard, he discusses foreign policy, international relations and rules of war and peace
 kootneeti ke sambandhon kaa vishleshan karne hetu usne mandal siddhant pratipaadit kiya he- Kautilya described the policy adopted by various states towards other states in his mandala theory
 pracheen kaal main bharat main anek chote-chote rajyon kaa astitv tha
 Powerful kings expanded their empire by war
 rajya kai baar suraksha kii drushti se anya rajyon main samjhauta bhi karte the
 According to Kautilya, a king who expanded his empire through war and conquest should increase the number of friends of his enemies, so that enemies can be kept under control
 duusari ore nirbal rajyon ko shaktishaalee padosi rajyon se satark rahanaa chahie
 They should form a group or 'mandal' to avoid expansionary policy of powerful states in association with states of equal status
 kautilya kaa mandal siddhant bhugolic aadhaar par yah darshata he ki kis prakaar vijay kii ichha rakhane vaale rajya ke padosi desh uske mitra yaa shatru ho sakate hai
 According to this theory, there is a king in the center of the mandal, who is willing to win other states, it is called "vijigishu"
 ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ ke maarg main aane vaala sabase pehla rajya ‘‘ari’’ tathaa shatru se laga hua rajya ‘‘shatru kaa shatru’’ hota he, atah vah vijigeeshu kaa mitra hota he
 Kautilya has also described "moderate" and "indifferent" states, which, despite being powerful, do not participate in the strategy
 kautilya kaa yah siddhant yatharthwaad par aadhaarit he, jo yudhon ko anterrashtriya sambandhon kii vaastaviktaa maanakar sandhi va samjhaute dwaara shakti-santulan banane par bal detaa he
 Kautilya has described six types of policies for conducting foreign relations - kautilya ke anusaar raja dwaara in nitiyon kaa prayog rajya ke kalyaan kii drushti se hi kiya janaa chahie
 Kautilya described the four principles of diplomacy with respect to the foreign policy of the state
 kautilya ke anusaar pratham do siddhanton kaa prayog nirbal raajaaon dwaara tathaa antim do siddhanton kaa prayog sabal raajaaon dwaara kiya janaa chahie, kintu uskaa yah bhi mat he ki sam daam se, daam bhed se or bhed dand se shreyaskar he
 Punishment should be used as a last resort, because it also causes damage to oneself
 kautilya ne guptcharon ke prakaaron va kaaryon kaa vistaar se varnan kiya he
 The undercover students could have been as homemakers, ascetics, businessmen and poisoners
 rajdoot bhi guptchar kii bhoomika nibhaate the
 Their task was to convey secret information of the country and abroad to the king
 ye janamat kii sthiti kaa aankalan karne, vidrohiyon par niyantran rakhane tathaa shatru rajya ko nasht karne main yogadan dete the
 Kautilya has suggested to keep the spies satisfied by giving them money and honor by the king
 logo ke jivan main mahapurushon ke vichaaro kaa kaaphi prabhaav hota he
 Chanakya's thoughts have also advanced the lives of many people
 chanakya kii kootneeti or iske sidhanto ke bare main kai pustake likhi gayi he
 There is a large section that reads Chanakya's life and follows it
 chanakya ke vichaaro ko anmol kaha jaataa he
 Chanakya's views are well liked by teachers, politicians and business people
 acharya chanakya kaa gauravshaalee vyaktitv ke bare main padhane se nai urja kaa sanchaar hota he
 Kautilya's thoughts are still inspiring
 yah satya he ki kautilya ne raashtra kii raksha ke liye gupt pranidhiyon ke ek vishaal sanghathan kaa varnan kiya he
 For Shatruksha, there is a law for poisonous, miscellaneous, ceremonial use, abhinaya mantra etc
 unethical and inappropriate measures and for the purpose of this great money expenditure and loss of money have also been declared in accordance with the national policy
 ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ main aisi charchaaon ko dekhakar hi mudrarakshaskaar kavi vishakhadutt chanakya ko kutilamati kaha he or banbhatta ne ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ko ‘nirgun’ tathaa ‘atinrushanspryopadeshm’ kahkar nindit batalaaya he
 In a newly available historical work titled 'manjushree Moolakalp', Kautilya has been portrayed as 'durmati', Krodhan and 'papak', the character of Garha
 praachyavidya ke visheshgy anek aadhunik paashchaatya vidwaanon ne bhi uparyukt aniatik vyavasthaaon ko dekhakar kautilya kii tulana europe ke prasiddh lekhak or raajnneetijna mekiyavali se kii he, jisane apni pustak ‘da prince’ main raja ko lakshya-prapti ke liye uchit anuchit sabhi sadhano kaa aashray lene kaa upadesh diya he
 Western scholars, etc
 Western scholars demonstrate the following similarities between Kautilya and Mekiavali: kautilya tathaa mekiyavali main aisi sadrushta dikhaanaa yuktisangat nahin
 Of course, Kautilya was also a realist like Mekiavali and was not merely a follower of idealism
 parantu yah kahana ki kautilya ne dharm yaa naitikta ko sarvatha tilanjali de di thi, satyata ke vipareet hoga
 Kautilya established itself in the first tribunal of 'arthashastra'; arthath- raja praja ko apane dharm se chyut na hone de
 The king should also conduct his religion
 jo raja apane dharm kaa is bhaanti aacharan karata he, vah is lok or paralok main sukhi rahata he
 In this very first tribunal, emphasis has also been laid by the king on arranging immortals and orders have been given to strengthen varna and ashram system
 yahaan par trayee tathaa vaidic anushthan ko praja ke sangrakshan kaa mul aadhaar batalaaya gaya he
 Kautilya has described the king as the consort of elders from place to place, humble in learning, jitendriya and suppressor of the enemy-conspiracy etc
 aisa raja adharmik athwa atyaachaari banakar kis prakaar praja-peedan kar saktaa he ? iske vipareet raja ko praja ke liye pitru-tulya kaha gaya he, jo apni praja kaa paalan-poshan, sanvardhan, sangrakshan, bharan, shikshan ityadi vaisaa hi karata he jaisaa vah apni santaan kaa karata he
 It is right that Kautilya has also preached to take unethical measures for Shatruksha
 parantu is sambandh main arthshaastra ke nimna vachan ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie: That is, these diplomacy measures should be treated only with irreligious and wicked people, not with religious people
 kautilya kaa rajya-siddhant bhartiya raajnneetik chintan hetu mahatvapurn dein he
 He freed political science from the tendency to lean more towards righteousness
 yadhyapi vah dharm va naitikta kaa virodh nahin karata, kintu usne raajnneeti ko saadhaaran naitikta ke bandhanon se mukt rakhaa he
 From this point of view his ideas appear to be a pre-eminence of the ideas of European philosopher Machiavelli
 is aadhaar par use ‘‘bharat kaa maikayavali’’ bhi kaha jaataa he
 Selitore opines that it would be appropriate to compare Kautilya with Aristotle, as both tend to place more importance on the objectives of the state than on taking power
 yathartwaadee hone ke naate kautilya ne rajya ke vyavhaarik paksh par adhik dhyaan kendrit kiya he
 Although Kautilya's kingdom is supreme, he is not indifferent to public interest

 Large-scale persecution of human beings has happened under this practice

 In the history of civilizations arising in all the plots of Asia, Europe, Africa, America etc

 Around 1510, when the first ship laden with African Habshi slaves reached the New World, there was a new turning point in the history of slavery
 mulnivaasee das kabhi kabhi apni vidrohi gatividhiyon ke kaaran shwet mahaprabhuon kaa saradard ban jate the or saath hi spain evam portugal ke raja tathaa dharmaguru bhi un daason ke prati sahishnutaa baratane kii charchaa karne lag jate the
 These new Habshi slaves were more obedient and hard-wired than the indigenous slaves, which was the main reason for these Habsis to cross the seven seas away from their African homeland
 at: habshiyon kii maang badhane lagi
 Slave labor in sugarcane, cotton fields and mines became even more useful than before
 falat: habshiyon kaa aayaat itnaa badha ki sheeghra hi pashchimi dweepasmoohon main unka bahumat ho gaya
 Under the aegis of greedy European powers, there was such fierce competition among the private companies of slave trading that by the early 18th century the Habshi slave trade reached its culmination

 Habshis were taken in return for goods and taken like animals in ships and transported across the Atlantic to America

 In fact slavery is a major basis of England, America and European capitalism
 ek anumaan ke anusaar san 1680-1786 ke bich lakh habshiyon ko atlantik paar le jaaya gaya
 These slaves also had to accept the language and religion of their various European masters as they could only get opportunities to keep their cultural heritage alive in that hell

 Habshi slavery and exorbitant conditions have been of special importance in the history of North America and especially of the United States from the beginning to the present day

 Although slavery was previously declared illegal in the United States, even today the biggest national problem there is the Habshi problem, which is not being fully resolved
 yah unheen habshiyon kii samasya he jinke parvaj shwet mahaprabhuon ke kritadas the
 In the 18th century in the United States, when there was some possibility of rebellions of the Habshi, it was legally forbidden for the Habsis to carry weapons, drum drums and take to the streets at night

 If a slave was tortured and mistreated in Athens, he could demand to be sold to another owner

 Man liberty was a major slogan of the American Independence War, and as a result, in the northern states of the United States, by 1804, the French state revolution, which had a strong allegiance to human fundamental rights, is more important in creating an anti-slavery environment

 Primitive among the Adibuddhas, that is, the Buddha
 inhen panchadhyani budhon main aadim athwa pratham kaha gaya he
 According to some people, initially the five Buddhist elements called Rupa, Vedana, Noun, Sanskar and Vigyan were composed of five Buddhist elements or wings like Panchadhyani Buddhas
 budhon ke kulon kii kalpana ke saath kuleshon kii bhi kalpana hui
 There are various views regarding the birth of Adibuddha theory
 kuch ke anusaar 10veen isvi shatabdi, duusare mat ke anusaar saatvin shatabdi tathaa tisare mat ke anusaar pratham isvi shatabdi main is siddhant kaa abhyuday hua
 It is so certain that this Adibuddhasiddhanta has been accepted as the theistic doctrine of Buddhists

 Taking inspiration from Hindu theistic principles, those people developed Adibuddha or Vajradhara Siddhanta in order of thinking of all these clans as well as the first or primitive Buddha
 adibuddha ko hi vajrayan kaa sarvocch devtaa sthir kiya gaya or yah mana gaya ki panchadhyani budhon kaa unheen se vikaas hua
 According to some opinions, this theory was introduced in Nalanda Vihar in the early 10th century
 duusare maton ke anusaar iskaa pravartan saatvin shatabdi main hi madhyabhaarat main hua
 After the enforcement, their form was conceived, idols were made and worship also stabilized

 This is considered to be the basic mechanism in which Adibuddhasiddha was enforced
 is drushti se is tantravishesh kaa bhi samay 10veen shatabdi nishchit haata he
 This theory was first accepted in the period of time
 adibuddha ke duusare do prasiddh naam hai vajrasatv or vajradhar
 According to some people, Vajradhara is conceived after Adibuddha, that is, Vajradhara evolved from the Bodhisattva Vajrapani developed from the meditative Buddha axis
 is prakaar vajrasatv parvarti vikaas he
 Often Vajradhara and Vajrasattva are considered one
 adibuddha in sabhi dhyani budhon ke janak hai or saath hi tantric buddha devamandal ke sarvocch devtaa hai
 In Adibuddha's human expression, expression is found in two forms - in solitary form and in Yugandha form
 ekaaki rup main adibuddha prabhutbhaven alankrita or vajraparyank asana main athwa dhyanmudra main abhivyakt hote hai
 Both their feet are placed on each other and both the soles are uplifted
 unke daahine haath main vajra, baayein haath main ghanta or shesh donon haath vaksh bhaag par ek duusare par vajrahunkaar madra main sthit rahete hai
 In this expression, the thunderbolt is the symbol of zero and the hour symbolizes the wisdom whose sound is transmitted far and wide
 kabhi-kabhi e pratik camel par donon taraf dikhaae jate hai jinamein se vajra dahini ore or ghanta bain ore pradarshit hota he
 In addition to the above characteristics, Adibuddha or Bajradhara in Yugandha posture is also connected with his power which is called Prajnaparamita
 yah shakti aakaar main laghutre or prabhutbhaven alankrita hoti he
 It holds curvat in right hand and cranium in left hand
 kartari agyaan ke vinaash kaa pratik he or kapaal purna ekta kaa
 In the Yugandha posture, it is symbolized that the distinction between dualism and advaaya is false and both are mixed with water
 tibeti lamas dharm main inhen praaia: nilvarna, praaia: nagn, buddhapurup asana or dhyanmudra main ankit kiya jaataa he
 After this theory became fully revered in Tantric Buddhism, Buddhists who believed in various aspects and forms of Adibuddha divided themselves into different sects
 kisi-kisi ne panchadhyani budhon main se hi kisi ko adibuddha maan liya, kisi ne vajrasatv ko hi adibuddha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya or kisi ne samantabhadra yaa vajrapani jaise bodhisattva ko hi adibuddha kii manyata de di
 Thus, the Adibuddha religion was divided into different sects
 nepal main aaj bhi buddha adibuddha se sambandhit vibhinn sampradaayon main vibhakt hai
 There some Buddhist sects consider Vairochan or Akshobhya as Adibuddha and some Amitabha
 is adibuddha ke abhyuday tathaa unke mat ke prasarashetra, mandiraadi ke sambandh main kathaayen milti hai
 On the basis of Swayambhupuran in connection with his emergence, it is said that Adibuddha himself first appeared as a flame in the Kalidah region of Nepal and Manjushri built a temple to protect that flame
 yahi pracheen mandir swayambhu chaityas ke rup main aaj bhi prasiddh he
 Thus Adibuddha is worshiped as a flame that Vajracharya considers to be continual, self-centered and independent

 Tetanus is an infectious disease in which nerve cells that control the skeletal muscle are affected
 kankalpeshiyon ke tantuon ke lambe samay tak khinche rah jane se yah avasthaa prakat hoti he
 This disease is caused due to contamination of wounds from soil bacteria
 is bacteria ko bacterium chloastrodium kaha jaataa he
 It can remain like a termite by making long holes in the soil
 jab koi ghaav is chhednuma ghar main rahanevaale dimak rupi bacteria se pradooshit hota he, to tetanus beemaari paidaa hoti he
 When these bacteria become active and grow rapidly and produce poison affecting the muscles, tetanus infection spreads
 tetanus bacteria puure vaataavaran main, aamtaur par mitti, dhul or jaanwaron ke mel main paaya jaataa he
 The path of entry of bacteria in our body is usually torn wounds, which are caused by rusted nails, metal fragments or insect bites, burns or skin bursts
 un logon ko bhi tetanus ho saktaa he, jinhen iskaa tikaa nahin padaa ho yaa jo log isaki booster khuraaq nahin le rahe hon
 Common tetanus exhibits the following symptoms: 50 yaa usase adhik umr ke vayaskon main tikaakaran kii sifarish kii jaati he, kyonki haal ke dinon main is ayuvarg main tetanus ke kai maamle saamne aaye hai
 Tetanus is more likely to occur in these people: oliya gaanv, koshyankutoli tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke nainital jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The Castle of Edinburgh or Edinburgh is a giridurga situated on a hill called Castle Rock in the middle of the city of Edinburgh, Scotland
 aitihaasik taur par, is kile ke sthaan par kamasekam 12veen sadi se ek shahi kile ke hone ke pramaan hai
 This fort was verified as a royal residence until 1633
 15veen sadi se, is kile kii rihaishi mahatv ghatane lagi or 17veen sadi se ise mukhyatah ek sainya thikaane ke rup main istemaal kiya jane laga
 From the 19th century onwards, due to the historical importance of this fort, it was seen as an important national heritage of Scotland, and thereafter several restoration projects were carried out on this fort
 scotian rajshahi ke sabase ahm gadhon main se ek hone ke kaaran, is kile kaa anek aitihaasik yudhon or muthbhedon main ahm bhoomika rahi he, jiname scottish swatantraaa yuddh or 1745 kii jaikobiyai jaagran shaamil hai
 Research done on this fort shows that in the history of 1100 years of this fort, at least 26 aces were placed on it
 aaj yah kila scotland kaa sabase lokapriy paryaton sthal he
 In 2013 a total of 1
4 million visitors visited this fort
 is kile ko edinburgh antarrashtriya mahotsav ke ageemburg military tatu ke kaarykram sthal ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he, jisame prayek varsh edinburgh, euke tathaa videshon se bhi lakhon log aate hai
 In view of its practical importance and popularity, this fort is also considered in many ways a symbol of the city of Edinburgh and the whole of Scotland
 is kile ke pratibimb ko edimbirag nagar parishad tathaa edinburgh vishvavidhyalay ke kulankon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 The fort has a number of buildings dating back to the 16th century, as most of the buildings in this fort were demolished by cannons firing at the time of Lang's entourage
 is sandarbh main sabase vishisht apavaadatmak bhawan saint margrets chapel he, joki 12veen saad se aabaad he, or ise aksar edinburgh kii sabase puraatan sanrachana mana jaataa he
 In addition, both the royal palace and its "great Hall" predate that barrier, though the Interiors of the Great Hall have changed considerably since the original middle-victorian period
 iske alaava yah kila, scotland kii rashtriya yuddh smriti, rashtriya yuddh sangrahalay tathaa scotian rajparidhaanon kii bhi mezbaani karata he
 Even today, the British Army has a presence in some parts of this fort, but now the presence of the army is only administrative and traditional

 Macdonald raajnneeti vigyaan main pratyakshvaad vah siddhanth he jo keval vaigyanik paddati se praapt gyaan ko hi aparyukt, vishwasaneey va pramanik maanata he
 The positivists believe that positivism is a ray of hope for industry, production and economic progress with the help of science
 is drushti se marks kaa vaigyanik bhautikwaad bhi pratyakshvaad ke hi nikat he, kyonki marks ne use tark kii kasuti par ksaa he
 Comte states that "any thing can be positive only if it can be proved by sense knowledge, that is, seen, heard, tasted or experienced
" ’’ With the advent of pragmatism, modern political theory has replaced traditional political theory in political science
 aadhunik raajnneetik siddhanth apane jivan ke praarambhik bindu par raajnneeti-vigyaan ko mulya-nirpeksh banane par jor diya
 Therefore, it is natural that this is possible only under science
 vyavahaarwadiyon ne raajnneeti-vigyaan ko prakritik vigyaan kii tarah banane ke liye vaigyanik paddati ko adhyayan va vishleshan kaa aadhaar banaaya
 This scientific method led to the advent of the concept of positivism in political science
 yadhyapi pratyakshvaad kaa prayog unani darshan main bhi miltaa he
 Aristotle nurtured the idea of positivism or positivism as the basis of the scientific method
 arastu se lekar ost comte tak maanav prakruti ko vaigyanik upayon dwaara purnataa evam vaigyaniktaa ko maanav jivan or vyavhaar kaa maardarshak bananaa, yah donon hi baaten bahut se logon va vichaarkon kii maang rahi he
 With the development of science, every aspect of society's behavior is also affected, it is common to use scientific method in social science
 pratyakshvaad kii vaigyanik vyakhya sarvapratham august comte ne kii he
 Comte has explained this concept in his compositions 'course of Positive Philosophy' and in 'the System of Positive Polity'
 isi kaaran comte ko pratyakshvaad kaa pravartak mana jaataa he
 Comte, by studying human history and determining the place of industrial and scientific progress in it, claimed that he had acquired the knowledge of the basic rules of human society and expressed his belief that if these rules were properly implemented If given, human progress can develop in a scientific way and achieve its fullness
 comte ko yah vishwaas tha ki maanav kaa vikaas jab purnataa ko praapt ho jayega tab pracheen manyataayen, paramparaayen evam naveen mulya samaapt ho jaaenge or unka sthaan naveen paramparaayen, manyataayen va mulya le lenge jisamen rajya kaa swaroop tathaa samast raajnneetik evam saamaajik rup-rekha main badlaav aa jayega
 Comte acknowledges each branch of human knowledge has to go through three stages to reach its maturity
 comte kaa kahana he ki samaaj kaa vikaas maanav buddhi ke dwaara hi hota he or isaki teen avasthaaen hai- In the first stage, man believes that natural powers or deities have a hand in the creation of creation, that is, he says that all the events are interpreted in terms of supernatural or spiritual powers
 duusari avasthaa main samast ghatnaon kii vyakhya amurtatatvon or anumaan ke aadhaar par kii jaati he
 Man starts considering able elements like soul in the creation of this creation
 yah avasthaa puraani avasthaa ke sthaan par nai avasthaa kii bhoomika taiyaar karne ke kaaran pratyakshvaad kii jameen taiyaar karne kaa kaam karti he
 In the third stage man begins to believe that all the phenomena of this nature are bound by immaterial natural laws
 is avasthaa main maanav man sristi va jagat ke nirmaan kii bajaay uski kaary pranali, niyam or tark buddhi kii vyavhaarik baaten sochataa he
 It is on this basis that Comtay has interpreted history and has given his theory of positivism or positivism
 comte ne vishwaas vyakt kiya he ki pratyaksh avasthaa hi maanav vikaas kii antim avasthaa hogi or yah avasthaa utani shighrata se praapt kii ja sakegi jitani shighrata se dharmik or abhibhautik ant vishwaason kaa ant hoga or janata vaigyanik dhang se sochane kii prakriya ko apana legi
 On the basis of this belief, Comte has laid down his principles of positive government, positive religion, positive education, positive state and law so that human society can awaken to religious superstitions and people will start thinking again and scientific thinking in public
 Be development uparokt vivechan se spasht ho jaataa he ki comte ne vaigyanik paddati ke antargat pratyakshvaad ke vichaar kaa poshan kiya he
 Comte has emphasized the fact that nothing is real beyond sense knowledge
 vaastavik vahi he jo ham dekhte hai va sunate hai tathaa apane jivan main prayukt karte hai
 The same ability to observe is found in all humans
 isliye ham apane anubhav ko dusron ke anubhav se milakar uski pushti va satyaapan kar sakate hai
 After this, the empirical statements become logical statements because we put every statement on the test of logic
 raajnneetik vigyaan ke antargat vaigyanik paddati kaa prayog karte samay anubhavvatmak or taarkik kathan kaa hi mahatav he kyonki uski pushti va satyaapan saralata se ho jaataa he
 Therefore, proponents of the scientific method oppose any statement in political science that is price-relative
 pratyakshvaad ke parvarti samarthakon ne comte dwaara di gai pratyakshvaadi vyakhya ko asweekaar kar diya
 These scholars include Max Weber, Vienna Circle, TD Walden, Moritz Schlick, Ludwich Wittgenstein and AJ Air
 in vidwaanon ko nav-pratyakshvaadi yaa taarkik pratyakshvaadi kaha jaataa he
 Weber said that science does not give us the answer to what we should do and what kind of life we should live
 shaikshik gyaan hamen sristi ke abhipraay kii vyakhya karne main koi madad nahin karata
 Therefore, there cannot be harmony in conflicting views about it
 raajnneetik darshan kii vyakhya pratyakshvaad ke siddhanth ke aadhaar par kabhi nahin kii ja sakati
 Because politics-philosophy is a matter of interest and it is foolish to examine it from an experiential point of view
 is tarah raajnneetik-darshan ke bare main pratyakshvaad madadgaar na hone ke kaaran aalochana kaa paatr bana he
 Later on, pragmatists have also criticized positivism in political science because it is an advocate of the value-free approach
 samakaleen chintan main aalochanatmak siddhanth ke antargat pratyakshvaad par jo prahaar hua he, vah dhyaan dene yogya he
 Herbert Marquejo says that in today's era, the language of political science is trying to be adapted to the language of natural science so that human beings can become a proponent of status quo by their way of thinking
 kuch aalochakon kaa kahana he ki yadi comte kii pratyakshvaad kii yojana safal ho jaae to vah nai tarah kii popashahi ko janm degi jisamen swarna, sura or sundari teenon ko jodakar logon ko mouj masti ke liye khulaa chhod diya jayega
 It is clear from this that Comte's positivism supports the theory of 'laissezfaire'
 uparokt vivechan se hamen yah nishkarsh nahin nikaalnaa lenaa chahie ki comte kaa pratyakshvaad kori kalpana yaa kora adarshavaad he
 The truth is that later thinkers like JS Mill also influenced Comte's positivism
 richard kaangriv tathaa harbart spencer jaise vichaarak bhi comte se prabhavit hue
 Comte's positivism is an important ideology and theory of political science
 isi kaaran comte pratyakshvaad ke janak hai or pratyakshvaad ke siddhanth va vichaardhaara ke rup main unki dein shaashwat mahatv kii he jo aaj bhi vaigyanik adhyayan kaa aadhaar he Jet propulsion or tachypropodation is the method of propulsion in which a jet of matter is used in the opposite direction of motion of the object to push the object forward
 isaki kriyavidhi newton ke gati ke tritiy niyam kaa par aadhaarit he
 It is a type of reaction propulsion ie it uses the power of reaction
 yah nodan praayah jet injanon main upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Similarly, jet propulsion is also most used for space vehicles
 bahut se jantuon main bhi jet nodan se aage badhane kii prakriya dekhi jaati he, jaise sheershapad, sandhipad praani, samudri khargosh, tathaa machhliyaan
 One of Newton's three famous laws is that every action has a reaction
 jaise mej ke upar yadi koi bhaar diya gaya he, to yah bhaar mej ko neeche kii ore dabaane kaa kaary kar rahaa he or kyonki mej is bhaar ko uthaa rahi he, isliye mej kaa dabaav upar kii ore he jiske kaaran bhaar uthaa hua he
 This upper pressure is called reaction and wherever an action is taking place, the reaction must be in some form or the other
 jab koi bandook chalaai jaati he to peeche kii ore dhakka lagata he
 If a ball is placed behind this gun, the ball can bounce and go very far due to this hit
 prayek mashin main kriya kii shakti ko hi kaam main laayaa jaataa he or pratikriya ko sahan karne kaa prabandh kiya jaataa he, jaise bandook main goli ko chalaaya jaataa he or uske kaaran dhakke ko sahan kiya jaataa he
 But the same reaction in tropes is taken that work that even good machines cannot do
 har prakaar kii motor gadiyon, hawaii tathaa pani ke jahaajon ke chalaane main piston injanon kaa upyog hota chalaa aayaa he
 Day by day new innovations were made in these engines and they started gaining more and more power
 in mashiinon kii or adhik teevr chaal kii maangon ne in injanon ke aakalpan ko yahan pahunch diya ki ab inaki or unnati sambhav nahin
 Also, due to this advancement, their machines became so entangled that it was difficult to make and use them
 isliye gas tarabine kaa upyog hua, jiske kaaran hawaii tathaa pani ke jahaajon kii gati atyadhik bad saki
 Now, tillering can be taken in two ways, one with gas turbine and the other using only Kship
 yadi is gas ke baahar nikalne kaa chhed chota ho to yah jor ke saath baahar niklegi, jisase gaadi ko dhakka lagegaa or vah aage kii ore chalane lagegi
 As the gas comes out loud, the speed of the car will also increase
 yadi gaadi halaki he or inamen gharshan nahin hota
 So its speed will be faster
 is gaadi ke is prakaar chalane kaa kaaran yahan kaha jaataa he ki yah gas chhed se baahar nikalati he to baahar kii hawa se takaraati he or isi kaaran gaadi aage bad jaati he, parantu vastusthiti yah nahin he
 If it is run at a place without air, then its speed will be more rapid
 isliye yah keval pratikriya hi he isko chalaati he
 In this way, this power is obtained due to the pressure of the retreating tube
 jahaan adhik chaal kii aavashyaktaa hui vahaan kshippranodan kaa upyog kiya gaya
 In fact, the practice of tricyclic will be successful only where more speed is required
 yudhkaal main samay kii bachat ke liye kship hawaii jahaaj kii unnati hui or udanevaale bamgolon main iskaa upyog hua
 The friction in ground machines is high
 or ve teevr gati se nahin chalaai ja saktin
 Therefore, trituration was not beneficial in them
 kshippranodan kii vaastavik unnati hawaii tathaa pani ke jahaajon main hui
 The light engines and rapid movement of such airplanes have reduced the time so much that it can be reached from one corner of the world to another in a very short time
 kshippranodan ke liye sabhi prakaar ke injanon ke nimitt ek hi niyam hai
 All the engines pull the outside air in themselves and the air and fuel are mixed inside it, where both are burnt
 is failaav ke kaaran mashin ko dhakka lagata he
 At the time of burning, fuel and air dissipate more and when the machine is running, the air mixture becomes more
 hawa tathaa inrdhan ke jalane se jo gas taiyaar hoti he usko adhik gati di jaati he
 The gas can gain more speed at the same time it is given the opportunity to spread properly
 parantu is failaav main gas kii daab ghat jaaygi, kyonki gas ko usee hawa main chhodana he jahaan se hawa ko eendhan ke saath milaane ke liye bheetar khinchaa gaya tha
 Therefore, full power will not be obtained by decreasing the pressure
 jab tak gas ke peeche puri daab nahin hogi, pranodan samarth na hoga
 Therefore, a compressive machine is arranged to get full pressure behind the gas
 is sampidak ko chalaane ke liye gas tarabine lagaaya jaataa he
 The compressor pulls the air out and throws it with full force towards the turbine
 tarabine tathaa sampidak ke bich eendhan ko isi hawa main mila diya jaataa he or is mishran ko jalane kaa avasar diya jaataa he
 By its burning, the volume and temperature increase at the same pressure
 yah shakti itani hoti he ki isse tarabine bhi chalaaya ja sake or kship ke liye bhi isamen puri gatij urja rah jaae
 The compressor pulls air to the combustion chamber, where the fuel is pre-ignited and this gas goes to the turbine at higher temperatures
 tarabine is gas se chalata he or yah tarabine sampidak ko bhi chalaata he
 This gas comes out of the turbine and exits at high pressure, spreading like a spur
 chalane ke samay yah tarabine duusare injanon se kam eendhan letaa he, parantu gati bad jane par yah sab injanon se kam eendhan letaa he
 Reaching a height, it consumes even less fuel
 is tarabine se chalanevaale hawaii jahaaj kii gati aavashyaktaanusaar nahin hoti
 For saving time and long journeys it is necessary that the weight of the airplane is reduced and the speed is high
 yadi hawaii jahaaj main keval kshippranodan hi ho, jisamen tarabine kaa upyog na ho to aisa ho saktaa he
 Many machines are not required in its machine
 is mashin ke keval teen bhaag he
 The first part is the front which has valves for air and the fuel hose through which the fuel is thrown from the pump
 in kapaaton ke samay par khulne se hawa bheetar jaati he
 These valves are closed when fuel and air burns to become gas
 eendhan ke jalane par dhadaaka hota he or gas baahar kii ore bhaagti he
 The second part is of the combustion chamber and the third part is of the drain behind the engine, the length of which is kept according to the power of the engine
 jab isko chalaanaa hota he to isamen sabase pehle eendhan chhidaka jaataa he or aag laga di jaati he
 At this time air valves open and the air comes in and mixes with the fuel
 milawat thik prakaar se kii jaati he
 The mixture of fuel and air burns in about 2 milliseconds and its temperature is 250 C
 And the pressure increases by 100 percent
 ab yah gas naalee kii ore jaati he to naalee main jane se pehle yah failati he
 When it goes into the drain, its temperature is 9000 c due to the diameter of the drain
 And the pressure decreases to 95 percent
 kothri se baahar nikalne tak kaa samay 8 milisecond ho saktaa he
 Thus the explosion caused by the mixture of fuel and air occurs quickly after each other
 isi dhadaake ke bal par or gas ke teevr gati se baahar nikalne ke kaaran pranodan ke liye mashin milti he
 The fuel is first burnt with electricity, but when the machine is running, the combustion chamber is so hot that the fuel burns on its own
 eendhan kii naalee kii lambaai itani rakhi jaati he ki hawa ke kapaat khulne se pehle hi jali hui gas baahar nikal jaae
 This type of machine was used in bombing you and is now used in airplanes, but it requires long space to run and must be high speed while running
 pehle yah vichaar tha ki piston ingine ke sthaan par kshippranodan kaa vyavhaar karne par bahut zyada kal purajon kii aavashyaktaa nahin hogi, parantu aisa nahin hua
 With the use of tarnishing, it was discovered that only fuel pumps have to be made very carefully and it is absolutely necessary to keep the fuel and air under control
 maan len gas nikalne kaa pariman m prati second he or isaki gati ga he
 The power running the machine was increased
 yadi gas ke baahar nikalne ke sthaan kaa kshetrafal ksha he to is sthaan par do daaben hongi, ek to baahar nikalanevaali gas kii daab jo ni1 he or duusari is sthaan par hawa kii daab, jo, maan len, ni2 he
 These two pressures will be against each other
 isliye is sthaan par daab hogi ksha jo m x ga ke saath kaam karegi
 Therefore the full power of propulsion will be = xx + q
 yadi gas baahar nikalanevaali chhed ko aisa banaaya jaae ki gas falkar daab ni2 tak aa jaae to ni1= ni2, isliye shakti =m x ga
 This is called Samirikana of Pranodaya
 pranodan kaa karyanupaat nimnaankit sameekaran se dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 Where c is the speed of speed and the speed of running of machine
 yah karyanupaat mahattam hoga yadi ga=r, arthath mashin kii chaal yadi kship kii chaal ke baraabar ho
 Third law of speed of jet engine new regulation of momentum conservation sanskrit kavyashastra main ginaae gaye chaar natya vrittiyon main se ek kaishiki he
 It is related to hair
 bharat muni ne kaishiki kii puranic vyakhya kii he or abhinav gupt ne vaigyanik
 Apart from this, Mallinath, Ramchandra, Raghavan etc
 have explained it according to their own opinion
 bharat ne kesh bandhate samay vishnu ke ang- vikshep se kaishiki kaa sambandh maanakar ise komal, sukumaar sharir cheshtaaon ke rup main grahan kiya he
 Abhinav Gupta has not taken the mythological premise that the way hair enhances the beauty of the body without regard to meaning and sentiment, similarly this instinct also enhances beauty in the play by body gestures
 isi prakaar kesh kii shobhaa striyon main hoti he
 Therefore, like the efforts of women, it is called kashiki by being a head or a female head, this is the opinion of the performer
 kaishiki kii katha kaa kaishik se sambandh maanak raghavan ne ise vidarbha desh se sambandhit lalit vaidarbhi romaniyata se sambandhit mana he

 narmasphot vividh bhaavon ke kshan-kshan main vibhooshit hone vaali vishisht rup vaali vritti hoti he
 There is a soft instinct where the protagonist does not result in complete harmony, where the hero behaves completely disguised with potential knowledge with special knowledge

 According to medical education, i will not leave without doing what is possible
 par jab koi marij apni arthi ke saath chalane waalon kii sankhya ginaney laga jaataa he tab dawaaiyon kii shakti aadhi rah jaati he
 If you can create any attraction in her life, due to which she starts discussing about the fashion of clothes that are prevalent in the next winter, then her chances of living will be at least double
 " After the doctor left, Suu went to her room and she wept and squeezed several handkerchiefs
 kuch der baad, chitrakaari kaa saamaan lekar, vah siti bajaati hui jansi ke kamare main pahunchi
 Jansi, clad in a cloak, stared silently, looking at the window
 use soi hui jaan kar usne siti bajaanaa band kar diya
 Putting paper on the planks, she sat down to draw a picture with pen ink for the story of a magazine
 navdith kalakaaron ko 'kala' kii manzil tak pahunchane keliye, patrikaon ke liye tasviren banani hi padati he
 For example, to reach the destination of literature, budding writers have to write stories in magazines
 jyon hi su, ek ghudsavaar jaisaa brijas pahane, ek aankh kaa chashma lagaaye, kisi idaho ke gadhriye ke chitra kii rekhaaen banane lagi ki use ek dhimi aawaaj anek baar duharaati-si sunai di
 She soon went to the sick bed
 jansi kii ankhe khuli thim
 She was looking out of the window and talking some count
 lekin vah ulta jap kar rahi thi
 She said, "twelve" then "eleven" then "ten" and "nine" and then together "eight" and "seven"
 su ne utkantha se, khidki ke baahar najar daali
 What was worth counting there
 ek khulaa, banjar chowk yaa bees fit dur eenton ke makaan kii kori diwaar! An old, snooty, inlaid, protruding
 The evergreen vine was halfway up the wall
 shishir kii thandi saanso ne uske sharir kii pattiyaan tod lee thim or uski kankal shakhaaen, ekadam ughadi, un tuuti-phuti iton se latak rahi thim
 Soo asked, "what is Jani?" atyant dhime swaron main jansi boli,"chha:! ab ve jaldi-jaldi gir rahi hai
 Three days ago there were about one hundred
 unhen ginate-ginate sir dukhane lagaataa tha
 She fell one more
 ab bachi sirf paanch
 " "paanch kya? jaani, paanch kya? apni su ko to bataa!" "leaves
 us bel kii pattiyaan
 The moment the last leaf falls, i too will leave
 mujhe teen din se iskaa pataa he
 Didn't the doctor tell you? " atyant tiraskaar ke saath su ne shikaayat kii, "oh! itani bevakoof to kahin nahi dekhi
 How is your recovery related to these leaves? You used to love that bull - why? naughty! Close your stupidity! Just this morning, the doctor told that the possibility of your recovery - where exactly were the words - said yes, the possibility is fourteen rupees and in New York, when we sit in a taxi or a new building
 Pass through, even then the possibility of living is no more than this
 ab thodaa shorwa pine kii koshish kar or apni su ko tasviir banane de, taaki use sampadak mahoday ke haathon bech kar vah apane biimaar bacchee ke liye thodi dawa-daaru or apane khud ke pet ke liye kuch roti-pani laa sake
 " apni ankhon ko khidki ke baahar tikaaye jansi boli,"tumhen ab mere liye sharaab laane kii jarurat nahin
 She fell one more
 nahin mujhe shorwe kii bhi jarurat nahin
 Now only four are left
 andheraa hone se pahile us aakhri pattee ko girte hue dekh luun-bas
 Then i will also leave
 " Soo bowed down on her, 'dear Jansi! You must promise that you will keep your eyes closed and will not look out of the window while i work
 kal tak ye tasviir pahunchaa deni hai
 i need light, or else close the window now
 " Jansi asked Rukhai, "can't you sit in another room and make pictures?" su ne kaha,"mujhe tere paas hi rahanaa chahiye
 Also, i do not want to let you look at that vine
 " Like a fallen idol, immaculate and white, closing his eyes, Jansi said, "speak to me as soon as i am finished, because i want to see that last leaf fall
 ab apni har pakad ko dhilaa chhodana chaahati hum or un bichaari thakee hui pattiyon kii tarah tairti hui neeche-neeche-neeche chalijana chaahati hum
 " su ne kaha," tu sone kii koshish kar
 i call that Behrman to be a laborer in the mine
 abhi, ek minute main aayi
 Don't move until i return! " boodha beharman unke neeche hi ek kamare main rahata tha
 He was also a painter
 uski umr saath saal se bhi adhik thi
 His beard, like the mosaic beard of Michael Angelo's picture, seemed to be waving from the head of a rogue monkey to the body of a ghost
 berahamam ek asafal kalakaar tha
 He had been doing meditation for forty years, but had not even touched the stage of his art yet
 vah har tasviir ko banaate samay yahi sochataa ki yah uski utkrasht krati hogi, par kabhi bhi waisi bana nahin paata
 Here, for many years, he had left this business, except making commercial or advertising pictures
 un navayuvak kalakaaron ke liye mandal banakar, jo kisi peshewar mandal kii fis nahin chukaa sakate the, vah aajkal apana pet bharta tha
 He would drink too much alcohol and talk nonsense about his masterpiece, which he cherished
 vaise vah bada khoonkhaar boodha tha, jo namr aadamiyon kii joardaar majaak udaata or apane ko in donon jawan kalakaaron kaa paharedaar kutta samajha karata
 Soo finds Behrman lying in his dark base
 usamen se ber kii guthliyon-si gandh aa rahi thi
 In one corner stood the blank blanket, which had been waiting for twenty-five years to mark the first line of his illustrious art
 usne buudhe ko bataaya ki kaise jansi un patton ke saath apane pattey jaise komal sharir kaa sambandh jod kar, unke samaan bah jane kii bhaybheet kalpana karti he or sochati he ki uski pakad sansar par dhili ho jaayegi
 The old Behrman angrily expressed his disdain at these foolish fantasies
 vah bolaa,"kya kaha? kya abhi tak duniya main aanse murkh bhi hai, jo sirf isliye ki ek ukhdi hui bel se pattey jhad rahe hai, apane marane kii kalpana kar lete he? maine to aansa kahin nahin suna! main tumhaare jaise bevakoof paaglon ke liye kabhi model nahin ban saktaa
 How did you allow this thing to enter your mind? Hey, Bachari Jansi! " su ne kaha,"vah beemaari se bahut kamjor ho gayi he or bukhaar ke kaaran hi uske dimag main ansi ajeeb-ajeeb kalushit kalpanaaen jaag uthi hai
 good; Old Behrman, don't be me if you don't want to be a model for me
 ho to aakhir ullu ke patthe hi!" Berhman shouted, "you are a girl's girl! Who said i will not be a model? Come, i go with you
" aadhe ghante se yahi to zinc rahaa hum ki bhai chalata hum-chalata hu! lekin ek baat kahuun- yah jagah jansi jaisi acchhee ladki ke marane laayak nahin he
 Someday, when i create my masterpiece, then we will all walk from here
 samajhi? haa!" When they reached the top, Jancy was sleeping
 su ne khidakiyon ke parde gira diye or beharman ko duusare kamare main le gayi
 From there they looked at the vine outside the window with frightened eyes
 fir unhone, bina ek bhi shabd bole, ek-duusare kii ore dekha
 The cold rainy snowfall was falling continuously with him
 ek ketli ko ulta karke us par neeli kameez main beharman ko bithaaya gaya jisase chattan par baithe huye, kisi khan ke majdoor kaa model ban jaye
 After an hour's sleep, when Suu's eyes opened in the morning on the second day, he saw that Jansi was rooting, tearing her eyes towards the green curtain of the window
 surasurahat ke swar main usne aadesh diya,"parde uthaa de, mai dekhnaa chaahati hum
 " vivash hokar su ko ajna manani padi
 But what is this! Even after rain, thunderstorms and snow fall overnight, there was a leaf in the vine, which was attached to the brick wall
 apane danthal ke paas kuch gahari hari, lekin apane kinaaron ke aasapaas thakaavat or or jhadane kii ashanka liye pili-pili, vah pattee jameen se koi bees foot oonchi abhi tak apni daali se latakarhi thi
 Jansy said, "this is the last
 maine sochaa tha ki yah raat main jarur hi gir jaaygi
 i also heard the sound of the storm
 khayr, koi baat nahin yah aaj gir jaayegi or usee samay main bhi mar jaaungin
 " takiye par apana thakaa hua cheharaa jhukaa kar su boli,"kya kahati he pagal! apana nahin to kam se kam meraa khyaal kar! main kya karuungi?" But Jansi did not respond
 is duniya kii sabase akeli vastu yah 'aatma' he, jab vah apni rahasyamayi lambi yatra par jane kii taiyaari main hoti he
 As the world and its bondage bound by friendship began to loosen, its imagination began to push it harder
 din biit gaya or sandhya ke ksheen prakaash main bhi, diwaar se lagi hui bel se lataka hua vah patta, unhen dikhaai detaa rahaa
 But just as night fell, the northern winds started moving again and the rain fell on the balcony, hitting the window
 roshni hote hi nirdayee jansi ne aadesh diya ki parde uthaa diye jaye
 The leaf was still present in the vine
 jansi bahut der tak usee ko ekatak dekhati rahi
 He called Suu, who was making chicken broth on the stove in the foursome
 jansi boli,"sudi, main bahut hi kharaab ladki hum
 Some power of nature, stopping that last leaf right there, told me how wicked i am
 is tarah maranaa to paap he
 La, give me some broth and mix some milk with poison
 par nahin, usase pehle mujhe jaraa sheesha de or mere sirahaane kuch takiye laga, taaki main baithe-baithe tuje khaanaa banaate hue dekh sakuun
 " koi ek ghannte baad vah boli,"sudi, mujhe lagata he ki main kabhi na kabhi neples kii khadi kaa chitra jarur banaaungi
 " shaam ko doctor sahab fir aaye su, kuch bahaanaa banaakar, unase baahar jaakar mili
 Taking the weakly trembling hand in his hands, Dr
 Sahib said, "now the possibility can be considered eight
 agar paricharya acchhee hui to tum jeet jaaogi or ab main, neeche kii manzil par, ek-duusare marij ko dekhne ja rahaa hum
 What is his name- Behrman! - May be an artist - has pneumonia
 atyant durbal or bura aadmi he or jhapat jor kii lagi he
 No chance of survival
 aaj use aspataal bhijwan duungaa
 There will be more rest
 " The other day the doctor told Soo, "jansi, now out of danger
 tumhaari jeet hui
 Now, only diet and care is needed
 " In the evening that day, Suu came and sat near Jansi's bed
 vah neeli oon kaa ek bekaar-sa gulband, nishcint hokar bun rahi thi
 He put his arm in Soo's neck, from that side of the pillow
 su boli,"meri bholi billi, tujhse ek baat kehani he
 In the hospital this morning, Mr
 Behrman died of pneumonia
 vah sirf do roj biimaar rahaa
 The day after morning, the watchman found him in his room suffering from pain
 uske kapade-yahaan tak ki juute bhi puri tarah se bhiige hue or barf ke samaan thande ho rahe the
 Nobody knows where he went on such a terrible night
 lekin uske kamare se ek jalati hui laalaten, ek nasahni, do-chaar brush or falak par kuch haraa or pilaa rang milaayaa hua mila
 Just look out of the window and see the last leaf near the wall
 kya tuje kabhi aashcharya nahin hua ki itani aandhi or toofaan main bhi vah pattee hilti kyon nahin? pyaari sakhi, yahi beharman kii utkrasht kalakrati thi jis raat ko antim pattee giri usee raat usne uskaa nirmaan kiya tha

 The president of the college gives him one last chance and asks him to accept his mistake as a socially-favored classical construction system, because Roark possesses great potential and qualities, and later becomes a renowned, prosperous and successful architect

 apni pehali imaarat dizine karne ke liye vah gupt rup se jaakar rork kii madad letaa he or uske vichaaron par aadhaarit nakshaa taiyaar karata he, jo safal hota he
 On the one hand Cameron and Roark create unique constructions that are not well recognized in society, and on the other hand, the flattery of Keating makes him successful and is made a partner in his company
 camran kii umr chadh rahi hoti he or vah apni company band kar detaa he
 Keating gives Roark a job, but soon the higher boss expels Roark for disobeying orders
 rork naukari dhundta he or use ek aisi company rakh leti he jo use manmarzi ke dizine banane detii he, lekin is shart par ki phir uske dizine usee company ke anya architecton ko die jate hai jo unamem pher-badal kar ke unke prathanusaar bana dete hai

 ek din rork pathar kii khan main kaam kar rahaa hota he jab vahaan se dominik guzarati he, kyonki vah usee shahar main apane parivaar ke ek aalishaan ghar main kuch dinon kii chuttee par ai hoti he
 There Dominique and Roark see each other and they instantly become mutual attraction
 lekin donon hi ek-duusare se akade rahete hai
 a few days later Roark arrives at Dominić's house and, without saying a word to each other, their physical relationships are established
 iske baad jaldi hi rork ko khabar milti he ki koi graahak usase ek imaarat banvaanaa chaah rahaa he or, is se pehle kii dominik ko uskaa naam bhi pataa chale, vah new york laut jaataa he
 Ellsworth is a folk writer on architecture in the Tohi Dominic newspaper itself, which has also published a number of books on the subject

 It has become a way for him to enter influential sections of the city and become powerful
 tuhi kaa hameshaa yah sandesh hota he ki kala ko ek saamaajik vishay he or usamen kaary janhit or jan-utthan ke liye hona chahie
 When a rich man left him a million dollars posthumously, Tohi gave this amount to an institution called 'center for Social Studies' where he was lecturer on the subject of 'art, a social trait'
 keating bhi tuhi kii lokapriyata se judana chahta he or chahta he ki tuhi apni likhaaiyon main uski ore bhi dayaa-drushti daale
 And the same thing happens
 tuhi rork kii azaadana soch or kaaryastylee se chidh jaataa he
 He asks Keating many questions about Roark
 kya rork hansataa he, kya vah dukhi lagata he, kya use paisa pasand he, kya use logon kii prashansa chahie or kya vah hameshaa architect bananaa chahta tha 
 Tohi now wants to destroy Roark
 dominik or tuhi donon rork ko ek sabha main dekh lete hai or dominik ab uski pahchaan jaan leti he
 She also realizes that Tohi will campaign against her
 akhbaar main apane agle lekh main vah rork dwaara banaai adbhut imaarat ke bare main ek pechida lekh likhti he jo use ek prakaash kii kiran bhi kahata he lekin uski ninda karata hua bhi lagata he: Tohi encourages a weak-minded Amir Seth to build a memorial named 'temple of the Human Spirit' by Roark, allowing Roark to build his own will
 vah isamen dominik kii ek nagn murti sammilit karata he jis se uske viruddh haahaakaar hota he
 Touhi now leads a case of cheating and disqualification on Roark from the same Seth
 isamen kai jane-maane architect aakar bayaan dete hai ki rork ke tareeqe pratha todate hai or galat hai
 Dominic makes a statement in support of Roark in the trial but Roark loses
 uski company phir band ho jaati he
 After Roark is defeated, Dominić decides that, because the greatness of people like Roark will never be accepted in this world, she will live her life entirely in the real world in which only people like Keating are successful
 vah keating se shaadi kaa prastaav rakhti he or keating manzur kar letaa he
 For this, Keating has to break his engagement with Tohi's niece, who loves Keating immensely
 dominik puri tarah keating kii ban jaati he - vah keating kii vyavsaayik tarakkee ke liye apane ghar par prabhaavshaalee logon ko daavat par bulaati he, uski har baat main haan-main-haan milaati he or vahi kahati he jo vah chahta he
 In the newspaper too, she writes in praise of Keating and condemns Roark
 iske baavjood rork ke paas kam maatra main aise graahak aate rahete hai jinhen uskaa kaam pasand he
 The owner of the newspaper for which Dominic and Tohi write is a very rich man named Gail Waynand
 vah ek mahaan nirmaan banavaane vaala he or uskaa kaam keating ko dilwane ke liye dominik vynand ke saath sone ke liye raji ho jaati he
 Wayanand then divorces Dominek and Keating by paying Keating his silence and then marries Dominek himself
 ab use gyaat ho jaataa he ki use jo bhi nirmaan pasand aaye hai un sab kaa mul architect vastav main rork tha or vah rork ko apana or dominik kaa ghar banane kaa kaam detaa he
 Wayanand and Roark share a deep friendship, though Wayanand knows nothing about Roark and Dominiuk's previous relationship
 dominik or apni khyaati kho chuke keating ko ahsaas hota he ki uskaa jivan asafal rahaa he
 But he goes to Tuhi and begs him to somehow get him to construct the 'cortland Niwas Project', for which all the architects are eager and doing which could bring him fame again
 tuhi use yah kaam dilava detaa he
 Keating knows that Roark has been the brain behind all of his successful builds, so he goes straight to Roark and asks him for help with the design
 rork ek shart par raji hota he - vah puri tarah gupt rup se cortland kaa dizine kar degaa lekin nirmaan bina pher-badal ke bilkul vaisaa hona chahie jaisaa vah banayega 
 After completing the design, Roark sets out on a ferry trip with Waynand
 jab rork lautataa he ko use gyaat hota he ki, keating ke vaayade ke baavjood, uske dizine main badlaav kiye gaye hai
 He goes and shoots Cortland with gunpowder
 puure desh rork ko apradhi maanata he lekin ab vynand faisalaa karata he ki vah rork kaa saath degaa
 He tells his newspapers to support Roark
 janata main rosh he isliye uske akhbaaron kii bikri girane lagati he lekin dominik kii madad se vah data rahata he
 Eventually, the newspaper's staff union comes and warns him - either he opposes Roark or else his newspaper will stop printing
 vynand haar maan letaa he or akhbaar main rork kii kadi ninda chhapati he
 When the proceedings begin in court, Roark seems to have no hope of survival
 lekin vahaan rork adaalat main upasthit logon ko vyaktigat swatantraaa, mul avishkaar or apni aatma ke prati sachcha rahane ke mulya par jhanzor dene vaala bhaashan detaa he
 Dividing humans into two classes, he states that: adaalat rork ko begunaah tehraati he
 Wayanand understands that his newspaper serves to crush personal capacity and independence and he closes it
 vah rork ko vishwa kii sabase unchi gaganchumbi imaarat banane kaa kaam saunpta he
 After 18 months the Wayanand building is scheduled to be ready
 upanyaas ke antim prishthon main dominik nirmaan sthal par jaati he or vahaan ek nayaa santari dominik se uskaa naam poochta he
 Dominić answers "mrs
