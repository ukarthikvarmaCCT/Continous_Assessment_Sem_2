 It may give better indication of the standard of living of Least Developed Countries as it compensates for the weakness of the local currency in the world markets

 For more information, see National Income and Production Measurement prati vyakti GDP ek arthvyavastha main jivan str kaa maap nahin he
 However, it is often used as an indicator of this kind, on the argument that all citizens will benefit from the increased economic output of their country
 isi prakaar, GDP prati vyakti vyaktigat aay kaa maap nahin he
 GDP can increase even if the income of most of the citizens of a country decreases or if it changes in proportion

 The key benefit of GDP per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured repeatedly, consistently and widely; Frequent means that most countries provide information on GDP on a quarterly basis, meaning that some measure of GDP is widely available for every country in the world, and the technical definitions used consistently within GDP, countries
 And are relatively stable, and therefore there is a belief that equal measurement is being done in each country
 jivan str ke ek sanketak ke rup main GDP kaa upyog karne kaa ek mukhya nuksaan yah he ki yah kadai ke saath jivan str kaa maap nahin he
 GDP measures a specific type of economic activity in a country
 GDP kii paribhaasha ke anusaar aisa jaruri nahin he ki yah yah jivan str kaa maap kare
 For example, in an extreme example, a country that exported 100 percent of its production and did not import anything would still have a high GDP, but a very low standard of living
 GDP ke upyog ke paksh main tark nahin he ki yah jivan str kaa ek acha sanketak he, lekin iske bajaay yah he ki jivan str us sthiti main badhane kii pravriti rakhata he jab GDP prati vyakti badhata he
 This makes GDP representative rather than a direct measure of standard of living
 prati vyakti GDP ko shram utpaadakta ke ek pratinidhi ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 As workers' productivity increases, employees must compete by paying higher wages for them
 iske vipareet, yadi utpaadakta kam he, to mazdooree kam honi chahie yaa vyapaar laabh kamaane ke liye sakasham nahin honge
 There are many controversies about this use of GDP
 GDP kaa prayog arthshaastriyon ke dwaara arthvyavastha ke swasthya ke maapan ke liye vyapak rup se kiya jaataa he, kyonki isaki kismon ko saapeksh rup se tunrat pahachaanaa jaataa he
 However, its value as an indicator of standard of living is considered limited
 GDP kaa upyog kaise kiya jaataa he, isaki aalochanaon main shaamil hai: In fact, a short-term increase in income inequality can be a factor in long-term reduction in income inequality

 The introduction of new products is also difficult to measure, despite the fact that it can improve living standards, it is not reflected in GDP

 In this way, circumstantial economists and green economists have proposed real progress indicators as an alternative to GDP

 1) Untrained driver - The main reason for road accidents happening in India is that people are given license in most cities, towns and villages without actually passing any exam, the truth is even Sometimes Joe R
T
O
 They are brokers, they tell people that you will not have to go there and we will get everything done, you will be given license at your house, mostly this is happening with women in India, although men are not too far behind in this matter
 , But the Ministry of Transport, Government of India has given a lot of strength to the process of granting licenses, according to the department, unless you go and give your paper yourself and come The trial will also be long, did not you Draving license, but it is within all only the Ministry of documents and offices, the Arktikok in In the office where this entire process takes place, all this work is done only by the RTO
 The soldiers do the same, they give you exams, they do the rest of the process
 If you have gone, then remain idolized and sit here, so here too the responsibility of the government comes out
 2) sharaab -:durghatnaon kaa doosraa sabase bada kaaran sharaab pikar gadee chalaanaa, hamaare desh main zyaadaatar driver sharaab ke nashe main gadee chalaate hai uskaa mukhya kaaran unki choubees ghante kii duty hoti hai, unka maananaa hota hai kii agar ham nasha kar lete hai to hamen neend nahin aegi jo kii bilkul galat hota hai, nasha karne ke baad unka sharir to jagaa hua rahata hai lekin nasha karne ke baad byakti kaa dimag apane aap sho jaataa hai or tabhi hadashe ho jaati hai, isamen bhi sarkaar ne bahut acha niyam bana diya hai, sharaab pikar yaa phir nashe main gadee chalaane vaale byakti ko sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya hai lekin yah sajaa zyaadaatar logon ko milti nahin hai kyuu kii pakaden jane par yah police ko kuch na kuch le dekar nikal jate hai, to yahan par laaparvaahee sarkaar kii nikal kar hi ai
 3) Excess of baggage -: One of the main causes of road accidents in India is that two times three to four times more luggage is loaded inside the vehicle than its capacity, due to which those freight vehicles Tires get ripped and accidents happen that cause damage to both goods and persons, ie both people and money, now the question arises that when everyone knows, why do people do this? Q, motor owners or drivers are ready to take the loss of both their lives and goods, the main reasons for it are as follows: 1) Police - The police of our country are responsible here, because most of the cases are not of guards but of eaters
 The way you work, you have to pay for your car, the road through which the city will pass, every turn, every toll, or wherever the police will find you
 If not sing without means police you will bother some time, To avoid this, people give money to the police and drive the car in overloading to match that money, here too the responsible administration is reducing the handriver's salary - from the very first day i have seen this drivers and motor Since trying to understand the world, since then i have seen only one thing that motor owners feel one thing is that the driver has extra income so he has less salary
 Things, owners are thinking less salary and driver equal undergo load then Extra freight train to offset that by selling Whoa your money, which is born due to the accidents
 Here also the responsible administration is the reduction of the handriver's salary - from the very first day i have tried to understand this drivers and motor world, i have seen only one thing that motor owners feel that one thing They have extra income, so they are paid less, the owners think that they pay less and the driver then loads the extra goods into the car to make up for it
 Te that sell do's equal their money, which are born because of the accidents
 Here also the responsible administration is the reduction of the handriver's salary - since the very first day i have tried to understand this drivers and motor world, i have seen only one thing that motor owners feel one thing is that the driver They have extra income, so they are paid less, the owners think that they pay less and the driver then loads the extra goods into the car to make up for it
 Te that sell do's equal their money, which are born because of the accidents

 5) Bad roads - One of the major reasons for road accidents in our country is that our roads are overly bad, due to bad roads, i do not mean only potholes on the road, the design of the road is also bad
 It plays an important role in being and the main reason for the deterioration of the roads is the contractual practice, most of the roads in our country or else, every road is not the government, but the people of Rasuk Dar Or they make private companies associated with this department, they get their design approved from the Government of India or they get the design and the contract to build the road and then they start their work
 , They do not mind that the road will run for ten days or fifteen days does not mean that their work is only till they get the money, demos mangal grah ke do prakritik upgrahon main se ek he or yah saura mandal kaa sabase chota upgrah he

 jain dharm main bhagwaan arihant or siddh ko kaha jaataa he
 Jainism rejects the notion of a creator God or power responsible for the expression, creation or maintenance of this universe
 jain darshan ke anusaar, yah lok or iske chah dravya hameshaa se he or inkaa astitv hameshaa rahegaa
 This universe is self-governing and operates on universal natural laws
 jain darshan ke anusaar bhagwaan, ek amurtik vastu ek murtik vastu kaa nirmaan nahin kar sakati
 a detailed account of the Devas is found in Jain texts, but these beings are not seen as creators; They are also subject to suffering and like all other living beings, they complete their life and eventually die
 jain dharm ke anusaar is sristi ko kisi ne nahin banaaya
 Goddess, the Gods who are in heaven are there because of their good deeds and cannot be considered God
 yah devi, devtaa ek nishit samay ke liye vahaan he or yah bhi maran uparaant manushya banakar hi moksh ja sakate he
 According to Jainism, the real nature of every soul is God and every soul has infinite philosophy, infinite power, infinite knowledge and infinite happiness
 aatma or karm pudgal ke bandhan ke kaaran yah gun prakat nahin ho pate
 This state of the soul can be attained through Samyak Darshan, Samyak Jnana, Samyak Charitra
 in ratantray ke dharak ko bhagwaan kaha jaataa he
 One God, thus becomes a liberated soul - liberation from sorrow, rebirth, freedom from the world, karma and finally the body
 ise nirvana yaa moksh kaha jaataa he
 Thus, in Jainism there is an infinite God, all equal, free, and all are infinite in expression of virtue
 jain darshan ke anusaar, karm prakruti ke moulik kan hote hai
 Those who have attained knowledge by abusing the deeds are called Arihants
 tirthankar vishesh arihant hote he jo 'tirth' kii rachana karte he, yani kii jo anya jeevon ko moksh-maarg dikhaate he
 Jainism does not teach dependence on any supreme being
 tirthankar atmagyaan ke liye rasta dikhaate he, lekin gyaan ke liye sangharsh khud hi karnaa padataa he
 The two verses of Acharya Samantabhadra Vritika Ratnakarand Shravakachara describe the nature of the object: niyam se dosha se rahit, sarvajna, hitopadeshi purush hi sachche dev hona chahie, anya kisi prakaar devatv nahin ho saktaa
 Earthhood, thirst, old age, disease, birth, death, fear, pride, raga, malice, attachment, sleep, perspiration etc
 are not the 18 defects; jain dharm main, panch parameshthi dharmik adhikariyon kaa panch padanukram hai, jo poojaneey hai
 Those five supreme creatures are the following - jinhone chaar ghatiya karmon kaa kshay kar diya vah, arihant kehalaate he
 Only those who attain knowledge by destroying all the diseases are called Arihants
 inhen kevali bhi kaa jaataa he
 There are two types of Arihant: tirthankar kaa arth hota he jo dharm tirth ko pravart karen
 The Tirthankara initiates the Dirtha crossing the Sansar Sagar
 tirthankar chaturvidh sangh kii sthapana bhi karte he
 The Tirthankara cannot be compared to any other deity, as he is a free-flowing soul
 tatah mukt hone kii vajah se, brahmand main kisi kii prarthana ke jawaab main hastkshep nahin karte
 All Arihants become perfect at the end of their age
 siddh ban chuki aatma jivan maran ke chakra se mukt hoti he
 Having exhausted all his actions, the Siddha Lord is full of Ashtaguns
 vah siddhashila jo lok ke sabase upar he, vahaan virajte he
 Eternal souls have become perfect
 jain dharm ke anusaar bhagavanta kisi kaa ekadhikaar nahin he or sahi drushti, gyaan or charitra se koi bhi siddh pad praapt kar saktaa he
 The perfected soul does not interfere in any work of the people
 siddh deharhit hote hai
 These monastic Gods are not worshiped by Jains for any favors or gifts
 vitaragi bhagwaan kii puja karmon ko kshay karne or bhagavanta praapt karne ke liye kii jaati he
 Inclusive education is an education system
 shiksha kaa samavesikaran yah bataata he ki vishesh shaikshanik aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye ek saamaanya chaatr or ek divyang ko samaan shiksha prapti ke avasar milane chahie
 In this, a normal student spends most of the time in school with a disabled student
 pehle samaveshi shiksha kii pariklpana sirf vishesh chaatro ke liye kii gai thi lekin aadhunik kaal main har shikshak ko is siddhant ko vistrut drushtikon main apni kaksha main vyavhaar main laana chahie
 The principle of inclusive education or integration has its historical roots in Canada and the United States
 pracheen shiksha paddati kii jagah nai shiksha niti kaa prayog aadhunik samay main hone laga he
 Inclusive education does not accept special schools or classrooms
 ashakt bacchon ko saamaanya bacchon se alag karnaa ab maanya nahin he
 Children with disabilities also have the right to participate in educational activities like normal children
 saadharantah chaatr ek kaksha main apni aayu ke hisaab se rakhe jate hai chaahe unka academik str unchaa yaa nicha hi kyon na ho
 Teachers treat normal and disabled children alike
 ashakt bacchon kii mitrataa aksar saamaanya bacchon ke saath karwaai jaati he taaki aise hi samooh samudaay banataa he
 It is shown that one group is not superior to another group
 aise bartaav se sahyog kii bhaavana babbti he
 Teachers use some methods to increase the feeling of collaboration in the classroom: ek shiksha, ek sahyog—is model main ek shikshak shiksha detaa he or doosraa prashikshit shikshak vishesh chaatr kii aavashyaktaaon ko or kaksha ko suvyavasthit rakhane main sahyog karata he
 Langkawi is an archipelago of Malaysia located in the Andaman Sea which is known for tourism

 arab log mukhya rup se arabi bhashaa or samskruti se jude hue hai haalanki aitihaasik rup se 'arab' kii paribhaasha main pher-badal aayaa he
 In some times this term is used only for Badu people, while in other times barbarians are also involved in it

 There is controversy among scholars regarding the source and meaning of the name 'arab'

 yah gindbu is yuddh main asyrian ke viruddh ladane vaale mitrapaksh main arab gut kaa sardaar tha
 The most popular story of origin of the name 'arab' is that it came from a man named 'yarb' who was the first person to speak Arabic
 pracheen arab buddhijivi al-hamadani kii alag raay thi
 He said that because the Arabs settled in the West from Mesopotamia, the word 'gharb' was used for them, meaning 'west' in Arabic and other local languages
 yahi bigadakar 'arab' ban gaya
 Another ancient Arab historian, al-masoodi, stated that the name was initially meant for the inhabitants of 'arabah Wadi' which expanded and began to be used for the entire race
 haalaanki bahut se log arab pahchaan ko muslim pahchaan jaisaa hi maanate hai, vastav main yah do alag chizein hai
 Many Arabs are Christians and some are Jews

 The Anatoli language family was a branch of the entire indo-european family, which became extinct over time, although some of its signs may have remained in local languages such as the Armenian language
 kaansya yug ke khatme ke baad anatoli logon ke kshetra par midi, irani, unani, roman, galaati, friji, bithni or oguz turkon ke hamale hote rahe
 Many of these attackers settled in Anatolia, which caused the Anatoli languages to disappear
 133 isapurv ke baad anatolia ko dhire-dhire roman samrajya main sammilit kar liya gaya
 Many linguists and historians consider Anatolia to be the birthplace of the indo-european language family

 pravaahee parivartanshiltaa kii vajah se bhi prashodhan suvidhaayen aksar aavashyaktaa se adhik badi or baad main adhik mahangi ho jaati he
 In addition, heavy storms that provide more water flow than the capacity of the treatment plant can have a major impact on the sewage treatment system causing water spillage or overflow

 There is no process that can completely eliminate the need for removal of organic solids
 haalanki, keechad ko bahut zyada garm karne or ise chote-chote golinuma daanon main parivartit karne ke liye kuch shaharon main ek atirikt kadam uthaae ja rahe hai jinamein bahut adhik nitrogen or anya carbonic padaarth hote hai
 In New York City, for example, several sewage treatment plants have hydroelectricity facilities where large centrifuges are used, along with the addition of chemicals such as polymer to remove excess fluid from the sludge

 Many processes in a wastewater treatment plant are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes occurring in the environment, whether the environment is a natural water body or land
 If not overloaded, bacteria present in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce oxygen levels in the water and can significantly alter the overall ecology of receiving water

 As a result, high-level wastewater treatment may not be required in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution

 It is understood from the mention of "nurdeen" in a verse of "rasgangadhar" that in the last years of Nuruddin Muhammad "jahangir" he came to Delhi and remained in the shadow of the Panipallavas of Delhivallabh till the reign of Shah Jahan and slaughter of Darashikoh

 Although he has not composed the epic, his liberation-poems and hymns appear to have evocative and sublime poetic style
 unki kavita main prasadgun ke saath-saath ajpradhan, samasbahula reeti bhi dikhaai detii he
 Fine verses of emotion, enchanting marking of images, rhyme of rhetoric, contextual and aesthetic appropriation of ornaments, euphoria and sense of dignity, and the creation of elegance in the collection of positions - are often ubiquitous in their poetry
 reetikalin alankaranpriyata or oohatmak kalpana kii udaan kaa bhi unpar prabhaav tha
 Both prose and verse - in his allegories, the use of excellent decoration style is found

 Drawing from the maturity of the book, litterateur Nagesh Bhatt wrote the commentary on "rasgangadhar"
 inke atirikt unke gadhy granth "yamunavarnan" kaa bhi "rasgangadhar" se sanket miltaa he
 The name "rasgangadhar" indicates that there would have been a plan for five "ananas" in this book

 gregorian calendar {gregory kaaldarshak}, duniya main lagbhag har jagah upyog kiya jane vaala kaaldarshak yaa tithipatrak he
 This is the adaptation of the Julian calendar
 ise pope gregory ne lagu kiya tha
 Prior to this, the Julian calendar was in vogue, but it contained many errors, which were corrected in the Gregorian calendar
 gregory kaaldarshak kii mul ikai din hota he
 There is a year of 365 days, but every fourth year is of 366 days, which is called leap year
 surya par aadhaarit panchang har 146,097 dinon baad doharaaya jaataa he
 It is divided over 400 years and equals 20871 weeks
 in 400 varshon main 303 varsh aam varsh hote hai, jiname 365 din hote hai
 And there are 97 leap years, consisting of 366 days
 is prakaar har varsh main 365 din, 5 ghante, 49 minute or 12 second hote he
 In the Julian calendar, 365 days was considered a 6-hour year, but assuming it takes 11 minutes 14 seconds more than a revolutionary solar year each year
 yah aadhiky 400 varshon main 3 din se kuch adhik ho jaataa he
 Pope Gregory of Rome first considered this mistake subtly
 unhone isvi san 1582 main hisaab lagaakar dekha ki naaise nagar ke dharm-sammelan ke samay se, jo isvi san 325 main hua tha, purvokt aadhiky 10 din kaa ho gaya he, jisko gananaa main nahin lene ke kaaran taarikh 10 din peeche chal rahi thi
 With this idea, he decided the 15th of October in 1582 AD in consultation with the astrologer Allay Sius Lilius of Naples, and since then took the rule that the century, if divided completely by 400, instead of being completely divided by year 4 It should be considered as leap year or not
 is naveen paddati kaa aarambh chunki pope gregory ne kiya, isliye isko gregorian paddati athwa naveen paddati kaha gaya
 This method was accepted in different Christian countries in different years
 isse in deshon kaa itihaas padhate samay is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he
 This new method was adopted by Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal in 1582, Prussia, the Roman Catholic Territories of Germany, Switzerland and Flanders in 1583, Poland in 1586, Hungary in 1587, Protestants from Germany and the Netherlands
 Territory and Denmark in 1700, British Empire in 1752, Japan in 1972, China in 1912, Bulgaria in 1915, Turkey and Soviet Russia in 1917 and Yugoslavia and Su Romania adopted in 1919 AD
 1582 isvi ke baad 1700 i0 main 28 farvari tak puraane calendar se naye calendar kii taarikh main 10 din kii hi vruddhi rahi
 Since 1600 AD was a century, it was completely divided by 400, so it would have been a leap year by the new method
 atah usamen taarikh main antar karne hetu 1 din kii vruddhi nahin hui
 This means that changing the date from the old calendar to the new calendar will be progressively increased from the aforesaid 10 days to one day in the same century years in which the 400 years do not completely participate
 arthath 1700 isvi kii 28 farvari ke baad naye calendar kii taarikh banane ke liye 10 din kii jagah 11 din jode jaayenge
 Similarly, 12 days will be added after 28 February of 1800 AD and 13 days after 28 February of 1900 AD
 punah 2000 i0 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hone ke kaaran yah vruddhi 13 din kii hi rahegi, atirikt 1 din nahin badhegaa
 The story of the eleventh effigy Trilochani is as follows- King Vikramaditya was a great Prajapala
 unhen hamensha apni praja kii sukh-samruddhi kii hi chintaa sataati rahati thi
 Once he decided to do a Mahayagya
 asankhya raja-maharaajaaon, panditon or rishiyon ko aamantrit kiya
 He did not leave even the gods
 pawan devtaa ko unhone khud nimantran dene kaa man banaaya tathaa samudr devtaa ko aamantrit karne kaa kaam ek yogya brahman ko saunpa
 Both departed from their work
 jab vikram van main pahunche to unhone tay karnaa shuru kiya taaki pawan dev kaa pataa-thikaana gyaat ho
 Yoga and meditation revealed that the wind god nowadays lives on the Sumeru mountain
 unhone sochaa agar sumeru parvat par pawan devtaa kaa aahmavaan kiya jaae to unke darshan ho sakate he
 When he remembered both the hospitals, he was present
 unhone unhen apana uddeshy bataaya
 The tribesmen hurriedly escorted them to the peak of Sumeru mountain
 chotii par itnaa tej hawa thi ki paanv jamaana mushkil tha
 Big trees and rocks were flying away from their places and going away
 magar vikram tanik bhi vichlit nahin hue
 He was perfect in yoga and meditation, so he sat down at one place
 bahari duniya ko bhuulakar pawan dev kii sadhana main rat ho gaye
 Don't forget to eat, drink, sleep and relax and indulge in spiritual practice
 aakhirkaar pawan dev ne sudhi lee
 The wind stopped completely
 mand-mand bahati hui vaayu sharir kii sari thakaan mitaane lagi
 Akashwani said, "O king Vikramaditya, we were pleased with your work
 apni ichha bataa
 " vikram agle hi kshan saamaanya avasthaa main aa gaye or haath jodakar bole ki ve apane dwaara kiye ja rahe mahayajna main pawan dev kii upasthiti chaahate hai
 Pawan Dev's arrival will enhance the beauty of his yagya
 yah baat vikram ne itnaa bhavuk hokar kaha ki pawan dev hans pade
 He replied that his presence in the sashirir yagna is impossible
 ve agar sasharir gaye, to vikram ke rajya main bhayankar aandhi-tufaan aa jayega
 All the ravaged fields, trees, plants, palaces and huts - all will be destroyed
 rahi unki upasthiti kii baat, to sansar ke har kone main unka vaas he, isliye ve apratyaksh rup se us mahayajna main bhi upasthit rahenge
 Vikram got silent considering his intentions
 pawan dev ne unhen aashirwad dete hue kaha ki unke rajya main kabhi anaavrishti nahin hogi or kabhi durbhiksh kaa saamana unki praja nahin karegi
 He then gave Kamadhenu cow to Vikram and said that due to its grace, there will never be a shortage of milk in Vikram's state
 jab pavandev lupt ho gaye, to vikramaditya ne donon betaalon kaa samaran kiya or vetaal unhen lekar unke rajya kii seemaa tak aae
 The Brahmin who had been given the burden of inviting Vikram to the sea god, reached the sea shore facing many difficulties
 usne qamar tak sagar main ghuskar samudr devtaa kaa aahmavaan kiya
 He repeatedly reiterated that Maharaja Vikramaditya is performing Mahayagya and has come to invite him as his messenger
 ant main samudr devtaa aseem gaharaai se nikalakar uske saamne prakat hue
 He told the Brahmin that the wind god had told him everything about that Mahayagya
 ve pawan dev kii tarah hi vikramaditya ke aamantran kaa swaagat to karte hai, lekin sasharir vahaan sammilit nahin ho sakate hai
 The Brahmin requested the sea god to clarify his intention, then he said that if he went to join the yagna, he would also burn a lot with him and everything in his path would be drowned
 chaaron ore pralay-si sthiti paidaa ho jaaegi
 Everything will be destroyed
 jab brahman ne jaananaa chaha ki uske liye unka kya aadesh hai, to samudr devtaa bole ki ve vikram ko sakushal mahayajna sampann karaane ke liye shubhakamanaayen dete hai
 Indirectly, in the yajna, Adyopati Vikram will feel them, because they live in every drop of water
 yajna main jo jal prayukt hoga usamen bhi ve upasthit rahenge
 He then gave five gems and a horse to the Brahmin and said - "give this gift to King Vikramaditya on my behalf
" " brahman ghoda or ratna lekar waapas chal padaa
 Seeing him walking, that horse said to him in human speech that why he does not ride on his back for this long journey
 uske naa-nukur karne par ghode ne use samajhaayaa ki vah raja kaa doot he, isliye uske uphaar kaa upyog vah kar saktaa he
 When the Brahmin agreed and sat down, the horse brought him to the court of Vikram with wind speed
 ghode kii sawari ke dauraan uske man main ichha jaagi- "kaash! yah ghoda meraa hota!" jab vikram ko usne samudr devtaa se apni baatcheet savistaar bataai or unhen unke die hue phuhaar die, to unhone use paanchon ratna tathaa ghoda use hi praapt hone chahie, chunki raste main aanevaali sari kathinaaiyaan usne raja kii khatir hanskar jhelin
 He tried hard to bring his words to the sea god
 brahman ratna or ghoda paakar phula nahin samaaya

 Important problems include: sansthaaen aksar badi hissedari ko niyantrit karti he
 In most cases they are acting as trusted agents rather than key owners
 saidhantik rup se sheyaron ke maalikon ke paas apane sheyaron kii vajah se milane vaale matdaan adhikaar ke madhyam se apane swaamitv vaali companiyon main badlaav laane kii kaaphi shakti hoti he or uske baad prabandhanon par dabaav daalane kii kshamta bhi hoti he or jarurat padane par vaarshik or anya baithkon main unhen matdaan ke madhyam se baahar karne kii bhi kshamta hoti he
 In practice, the ultimate owners of shares often do not exercise their collective power, but financial institutions sometimes do
 ek aam dharna he ki shairdharak - is maamle main, agenton ke rup main kaam karne vaali sansthaaen - un companiyon par adhik sakriy prabhaav daal sakate hai or daalana chahie jin companiyon main unke share hai 
 is tarah kii karrwai se prabandhan kii nigaraanee karne waalon main ek dabaav samooh shaamil ho jayega
 The problem, however, is how the institution should use this power
 For this, the institution has to decide one way and another way is to survey its beneficiaries
 yah maanate hue ki sanstha surveykshan yaa chunaav kaa sahaara leti he to kya daale gaye zyaadaatar matadaanon dwaara nirdeshit sampoorn share par matdaan kiya janaa chahie? yaa matdaan ke anupaat ke anusaar matdaan ko bhajit kiya janaa chahie? yaa parheziyon kaa sammaan karte hue keval pratyrthiyon ke sheyaron par matdaan diya janaa chahie? The price signals provided by large active managers who hold or do not own shares may contribute to management change
 udhaaharan ke liye is tarah kaa maamla tab dekhne ko miltaa he jab koi bada sakriy prabandhak kisi company ko apana pad bechata he jiske falswaroop share kii keemat main giravat aa jaati he lekin isse adhik mahatvapurn baat yah he ki company ke prabandhan main bazaaron ke vishwaas kii haani hoti he or is prakaar prabandhan team main teji se badlaav hone lagata he
 Some institutions are more assertive and active in emulating such things, with some companies believing that investment gains are made by accumulating substantial minority stakes and pressuring management to make significant changes in business
 kuch maamalon main alpsankhyak hissedari vaale santhaan prabandhan ko badalane par majaboor karne ke liye ek saath milakar kaam karte hai
 The pressure exerted by large institutions on management teams through motivational interactions and PR is often more frequent
 duusari taraf sabase bade nivesh prabandhakon main se kuch prabandhak jaise blakerock or vanguard prabandhan tiimon ko prabhavit karne ke liye incentive ko kam karke bas harek company par swaamitv sthapit karne kii vakaalat karte hai
 One reason for this final strategy is that investment managers prefer to establish a closer, more open and honest relationship with the company's management team that can sustain their control efforts, enabling them to make better investment decisions

 While American companies generally cater to the needs of shareholders, Japanese businesses typically have a shareholder mindset under which they seek the consensus of all interested parties

 3-P, Process and People) are often used to describe the reasons for a manager's ability to produce above average results
 nivesh prabandhan udyog kaa mukhya aadhaar prabandhak hai jo client ke niveshon ko nivesh or vinihit karte hai
 a certified company investment advisor should evaluate the individual needs and risk profile of each client
 The advisors then suggest appropriate investment
 parisampatti ke varg kii alag-alag paribhaashaon ko lekar kaaphi vivaad he lekin aam taur par iske chaar prabhag stock, band, achal sampatti or camodity hai
 Investment management companies are paid only for carrying out the work of allocation of funds between these assets
 parisampatti varg alag-alag bazaar gatishiltaa or alag-alag paraspar prabhaavon kaa pradarshan karte hai jisase kosh ke prabandhan par parisampatti virgon ke bich paise ke aavanton kaa mahatvapurn prabhaav padegaa
 kuch shodhon se pataa chalata he ki parisampatti virgon ke bich kiye jane vaale aavanton main portpholio pratifal ke nirdhaaran main vyaktigat hissedari ke chunaav kii tulana main adhik bhavisuchak shakti hoti he
 It is evident that the skill of a successful investor manager plays an important role in the creation of asset allocation and in the individual shareholding to give better results by some criteria 


 vibhinn parisampattiyon ke dirghakaalin pratifalon ke saboot or aavadhik pratifalon kii hissedari par dhyaan dena bahut myne rakhata he
 For example, in most countries, bonds have received higher returns than equities over a much longer holding period and more returns from bonds than cash
 vittiya siddhant ke anusaar iskaa kaaran yah he ki baandon kii tulana main equity adhik jokhim bharaa hota he jabaki nakadi kii tulana main band adhik jokhim bharaa hota he
 Against the backdrop of asset allocation, fund managers consider the degree of diversification that makes sense for a given client and thereby build the list of planned holdings accordingly
 is suchi se yah sanket milegaa ki prayek vishesh stock yaa band main kitna pratishat dhan kaa nivesh kiya janaa chahie
 portpholio vividhikaran ke siddhant kaa pratipaadan marcovitz ne kiya tha or prabhavi vividhikaran ke liye parisampatti pratifalon or deyta pratifalon, portpholio ke aatanrik muddon or pratifalon ke bich paar-sahasambandhon ke bich aapasi sambandh kaa prabandhan aavashyak he
 Funds are managed by institutions based on a variety of styles

 inamen se prayek drushtikon kii apni vishisht visheshtaayen, samarthak or kisi vishesh vittiya parivesh main apni vishisht jokhim visheshtaayen hoti hai
 For example, it is clear that growth styles are particularly effective when companies capable of generating such growth are nominal; Conversely, when such growth occurs in large quantities, then it becomes clear that the price styles seem to outperform the indices especially successfully
 kosh pradarshan ko aksar kosh prabandhan kii kasuti mana jaataa he or sansthagat sandarbh main sahi maap ek aavashyaktaa he
 To this end, institutions measure the performance of each fund under their management and performance is also measured by external companies specializing in performance measurement
 pramukh pradarshan maapan companiyaan yaa europe main bi-sam ) sakal udyog vivaran jamaa karti he jaise yah dikhaate hue ki kaise koshon ko aam taur par vibhinn samyaavadhiyon main sahakarmi samoohon or pradutt suchakaankon ke khilaaf pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 In a specific case every quarter will be calculated and the percentage change will be seen as compared to the previous quarter
 This figure will be compared with other similar funds within the institution, with performance details of peer group funds, and with relevant indices or teller-created performance criteria
 Specialized performance measurement companies calculate quartile and decile data and special attention will be paid to the ranking of any fund
 aam taur par kaha jaataa he ki vyavsaay chakra ke pradarshan or prabhaav main atialpakaaleen utaar chadhaav ko sahaj banane ke liye apane clienton ko lambii avadhiyon main pradarshan kaa akalan karne ke liye raji karnaa ek nivesh company ke liye shaayad upyukt hota he
 However, this task can prove to be difficult and from the industry point of view there is a serious delusion with short-term numbers and the relationships established with clients begin to suffer
 ek sthaayee samasya yah he ki pradarshan kii maap kar se pehle kii jaani chahie yaa kar ke baad
 kar-pashchaat pradarshan niveshak ke laabh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he lekin niveshak kii kar sthiti bhinn ho sakati he
 Pre-tax performance can be particularly misleading in terms of the rule that capital gains received are taxed
 is prakaar yah sambhav he ki safal sakriy prabandhak dukhad kar-pashchaat parinaam utpann kar sakate hai
 One possible solution is to report the post-tax status to any standard taxpayer
 pradarshan maapan ko keval kosh pratifal ke moolyankan tak hi simit nahin kiya janaa chahie balki isamen anya kosh tatwon ko bhi ekikrut karnaa jaruri he jo niveshkon ke liye ruchikar hoga jaise uthaae gaye jokhim kii maap
 kai anya pahalu bhi pradarshan maapan kaa hissaa hai: yah moolyankan karnaa ki kya prabandhakon ko apane uddeshy ko puraa karne main safalataa mili he arthath kya unka pratifal uthaae gaye jokhimon ke liye paryaapt rup se adhik tha; apane sahakarmiyon kii tulana main unki sthiti kisi he; or antat portpholio prabandhan ke parinaam bhagya se praapt hue the yaa prabandhak ke kaushal kii vajah se
 in sabhi sawaalon ke jawaab dene kii jarurat ke falswaroop adhik parishkrut pradarshan maapon kaa vikaas hua he jinamein se kai maapon kii utpatti aadhunik portpholio siddhant main hui he
 Modern portfolio theory established the quantitative link that exists between portfolio risk and return
 sharp dwaara viksit capital asset prising model ne jokhim pradaan karne kii dharna par prakaash daalaa or pratham pradarshan sanketakon ko prastut kiya, chaahe ve jokhim-samyojit anupaat ho yaa mandandon kii tulana main antareey pratifal 
 sharp anupaat sabase saral or sabase mashhoor pradarshan maap he
 It measures the return of the portfolio in excess of the risk-free rate compared to the total risk of the portfolio
 is maap ko purna mana jaataa he kyonki yah kisi maandand ko sanderbhit nahin karata he or maandand ke kharaab vikalp se sambandhit kamiyon se dur rahata he
 Meanwhile it does not allow the separation of market performance in which the portfolio has been invested on behalf of the manager
 soochna anupaat sharp anupaat kaa adhik saamaanya rup he jisamen jokhim mukt parisampatti ko maandand portpholio dwaara pratisthapit kar diya jaataa he
 This measure is relative because one evaluates portfolio performance in the context of a criterion from which the outcome is largely based on this criterion option
 portpholio alpha ko portpholio ke pratifal or maandand portpholio ke pratifal ke bich ke antar kii maap karke praapt kiya jaataa he
 This measurement appears to be the only reliable performance measurement to evaluate active management
 vastav main hamen chaahe bazaar samay, stock peking yaa saubhaahgya se vibhinn jokhimon ke prati portpholio anaavaran ke liye uchit inaam dwaara pradaan kiye jane vaale or prabandhak ke kaushal kii vajah se asaamaanya pradarshan se niskriy prabandhan ke madhyam se praapt hone vaale saamaanya pratifalon ke bich antar sthapit karnaa padataa he
 The first component relates to allocation and style investment options that may not be subject to the manager's singular control and which depends on the economic context while the second component is an evaluation of the success of the manager's decisions
 keval parvarti ghatak jise alpha dwaara mapa jaataa he, prabandhak ke sachche pradarshan ke moolyankan kii anumati detaa he 
 Portfolio returns can be evaluated using factor models
 jensen dwaara prastaavit pehla model siepiem par nirbhar karata he or ekmaatr kaarak ke rup main bazaar suchakank ke saath portpholio pratifalon kii vyakhya karata he
 However, it becomes immediately clear that one factor is not enough to explain the returns very well and therefore other factors should also be considered
 As an alternative to CAPM, multi-factor models were developed that allow better description of portfolio risks and more accurate assessment of portfolio performance
 udhaaharan ke liye, phama and french ne do mahatvapurn karkon par prakaash daalaa he jo bazaar jokhim ke alaava ek company ke jokhim ko bhi chitrit karte hai
 These factors are the ratio of the book to the market and the size of the company as measured by the market capitalization of the company
 isliye phama and french ne portpholio ke saamaanya pratifalon kaa varnan karne ke liye teen karkon vaale model kaa prastaav diya
 karcart ne pratifalon kii alpakaalik dridhtaa par dhyaan dene ke liye ek chauthe kaarak ke rup main samveg ko shaamil karne kaa prastaav diya
 iske alaava sharp kaa style vishleshan model bhi pradarshan maapan ke liye hitkar he jisamen kaarak style suchakank hai
 The model allows a customary criterion to develop each portfolio using a linear combination of style indices that best replicates portfolio style allocation and consequently gives an accurate assessment of portfolio alpha

 Those aspiring to become an investment manager may require additional education after graduating in business, finance or economics

 It is a tradition in the industry to find such people, appoint them and generously reward them without reference to any formal qualifications

 The shia-sunni dispute is one of Islam's oldest and deadliest battles
 isaki shuruyaat islamic pigambar mohammad kii mrityu ke baad, san 632 main, islam ke uttaradhikari pad kii ladaai ko lekar hui
 Some said that Muhammad Sahib made his cousin and son-in-law Ali the heir of Islam, while others believed that Muhammad Sahib only asked to take care of Hazrat Ali and that the real heir should be Abu Bakr
 jo log ali ke uttaradhikaar ke samarthak the unhen shiya kaha gaya jabaki abu bakar ke netaa banane ke samarthakon ko sunni kaha gaya
 Note that Abu Bakr was actually made a caliph and Ali was made a caliph only after its two caliphs
 isse donon pakshon main ladaai jari rahi
 The second, third and fourth caliphs were assassinated - the names of these caliphs are Omar, Osman and Ali
 shiya, ali se apane netaaon kii ginati karte hai or apane netaa ko khaliph ke badale imam kehete hai
 The entire Arabian Peninsula came under the leadership of Muhammad for the first time under one faith and empire
 itane bade samrajya ke adhikari banane kii hode se is matbhed kaa janm hua
 Hazrat Ali, who was both Muhammad Sahib's cousin and son-in-law, was the real heir to Hazrat Muhammad Saheb and should have become the first Khalifa
 yadhyapi aisa hua nahin or unako teen or logon ke baad caliph, yani pradhan netaa, banaaya gaya
 Ali and then his descendants should have become the chief of Islam, a Shia who believes so
 sunni musalmaan maanate hai ki hazarat ali sahit pehle chaar khaliph satpathi the jabaki shiya musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki pehle teen khaliph islam ke gaiyr-vaazib pradhan the or ve hazarat ali se hi imaamon kii ginati aarambh karte hai or is ginati main caliph shabd kaa prayog nahin karte
 Sunni considers Ali a Khalifa and Khalifa Yajid, who killed his son Hussein, is called a misguided Muslim in many places
 haalanki ye sirf uttaradhikaar kaa maamla tha or hazrat ali bhi kai varshon ke baad caliph bane par isse muslim samudaay main vibhed aa gaya jo sadiyon tak chalaa
 In the world today, Sunnis are in the majority but Shia belief is predominant in many countries including Iran, Iraq

 In today's scientific age, no country can live separately
 in deshon main parsparik sambandh jodna aaj ke yug main aavashyak ho gaya he
 Qualified individuals are sent from one country to another to connect these relations
 ye vyakti apni yogyata, kushalta or kootneeti se duusare desh ko praayah mitra bana lete hai
 Even in ancient times, one state used to send its diplomats to connect diplomatic relations with another state
 pehle kootneeti kaa arth 'saude main yaa len dein main vaakya chaaturi, chal-prapanch, dhokhaa-dhadi' lagaaya jaataa tha
 a person who used to get maximum benefits for his country by paying a lower price was called a skilled diplomat
 parantu aaj chal-prapanch ko kootneeti nahin kaha jaataa he
 Scientifically, in modern times the term is used for peaceful settlement in two states
 diplomasi ke liye hindi main kootneeti ke sthaan par rajnay shabd kaa prayog hone laga he
 The international world has become like a family
 parivaar ke sadasyon main prem, sahyog, sadbhaavna tathaa mitrataa kaa sambandh jodna ek kushal rajanyajna kaa kaam he
 The word 'rajnay' is a Hindi translation of the English word 'diplomacy'
 diplomasi shabd kii utpatti greek bhashaa ke diploun shabd se hui he jiskaa arth modana athwa doharaa karnaa he
 The Roman Empire developed after the fall of the Greek states
 roman samrajya main passport evam sadakon par chalane ke anumati patr aadi dohare karke sil diye jate the
 These passports and permission cards were inscribed on metal letters
 inako 'diploma' kaha jaataa tha
 Gradually, the term diploma was used for all government papers
 videshiyon ke visheshadhikaar athwa unmukti evam videshi sandhiyon sambandhi kagajaat bhi 'diploma' kahe jane lage
 When the number of these treaties became more, they were kept in safe places
 ye sthaan baad main 'rajkeey abhilekhagaaron' ke naam se jane gayi
 As the number of diplomats of the coronation offices increased, they were recruited and separately appointed to look after them and take care of them
 in karmchaariyon kaa kaary rajanyik krity kaha gaya
 Gradually, the term diplomacy started being used for this business
 rajnay shabd kaa prayog vichaarkon dwaara anek arthon main kiya gaya he
 According to Herald Nicholson, it is sometimes used as a synonym for foreign policy, such as Indian diplomacy was not successful in neighboring countries
 kabhi is shabd dwaara sandhi vaarta ko ingit kiya jaataa he, jaise is samasya ko rajnay dwaara suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The diplomatic treaty also indicates the process and mechanism of negotiation
 kabhi-kabhi videsh seva kii ek shakha ko rajnay kah diya jaataa he
 Diplomacy is also considered to be the intangible quality or skill of negotiating an international treaty
 iskaa sabase dooshit prayog vah he jab ise ek kapattapurna kaary arth main liya jaataa he
 Thus, due to the use of the word diplomacy in various meanings, it creates confusion in the mind of the reader
 shaayad raajnneeti shaastra main yah shabd sabase adhik bhram utpann karne vaala he
 In this subject, Argensky has said that qualities like 'skill, cleverness and deceit' can be signs of good diplomacy, but they cannot be called characteristics that define diplomacy
 rajnay videsh niti ke samakaksh bhi nahin
 It is such a part of foreign policy that contributes actively to its creation and implementation
 ' According to Argensky- sar arnest santon ke anusaar, In this regard, Palmer and Perkins have expressed a curiosity that if there is a lack of intelligence and tact in the mutual relations of states, would diplomacy be impossible? It is clear that diplomacy is a relationship between two or more independent states, accordingly each state uses intelligence, skill and tact
 ke0em0 panikkar ke shabdon main, Quincy Wright has defined diplomacy in two ways - in the popular sense and in the special sense
 lokapriy arth main - The special point of this definition is that diplomacy in the popular sense has been considered a treaty that is based on persuasion rather than pressure
 iske vishesh arth main rajanyagnon ko rashtriya hit ke prati bhakthipurna mana gaya he
 Popular meaning of diplomacy does not apply in political science
 anterrashtriya sambandhon main rajnay keval vahi kaary karata he jahaan dabaav kii sambhaavnaayen rahati hai
 These possibilities are suppressed by diplomacy
 rajnay kaa uddeshy samjhaute karnaa he or samjhaute keval vahiin kiye jate hai jahaan kuch asahmatiyaan hon
 These disagreements should be such that negotiations can be agreed
 purna sahmati ke kshetron main rajnay apraasangik he tathaa purna asahmati ke kshetron main yah prabhaavaheen he
 According to Roberto Regella, the word diplomacy has been misused
 asal main rajnay ek aisa vyavsaay he jisamen anek kriyaayen shaamil ho jaati hai
 It is one of the few professions in the world that covers every branch of human activity in its periphery
 iskaa sambandh shakti raajnneeti aarthik shakti evam vichaardhaaraon ke sangharsh se he
 Regella considers diplomacy to be the 'art of negotiation'
 1796 main edmand bark ne rajnay kii paribhaasha dete hue likhaa tha ki rajnay anterrashtriya sambandhon kaa parichaalan athwa sanchaalan he
 George F
 Cannon states that in the technical sense diplomacy can be arranged as a link between governments
 is prakaar vibhinn vichaarkon ne rajnay kii vibhinn paribhaashayen di hai
 All these definitions are not entirely appropriate as the meaning of diplomacy changes as time and circumstances change
 anek vichaarkon ne rajnay ko keval ek vyavsaay hi nahin varan ek kala bhi mana he
 Most governments have started adopting it for the attainment and growth of their interests
 yah dhire-dhire shaanti kaa ek prabhaavshaalee saadhan banataa ja rahaa he
 Initially the states were full of unlimited powers and as a result, diplomats were considered sovereign
 unhen kaary karne kii paryaapt swatantraaa saunpi jaati thi
 Another reason for this freedom was that there was a lack of rapid means of communication at that time
 19veen shatabdi ke uttararddh main rajanyikon kii yah vyapak swatantraaa simit hone lagi
 Another feature of diplomacy at that time was also that diplomats were sent only by giving orders and instructions related to their work
 aajkal sanchaar ke tivrgami sadhano kii suvidha ke kaaran yah aavashyak nahin rahaa he
 Some people consider diplomacy to be a mysterious business
 yah sahi nahin he
 According to Hudh Gibson, "in fact, diplomacy is an illusionary business
 yah jaadu athwa rahasy se pare he
 It can be seen as a serious business like any other government function
 paamar tathaa parickens ne rajnay kii kuch visheshtaon kaa varnan kiya he
 These features will prove useful to explain the nature of diplomacy
 ye visheshtayen nimnlikhit hai :- Nicholson is not right to say that diplomatic work ceases when the war begins, as Palmer and Perkins think diplomats work to protect the country
 atah yuddh ke samay haath par haath dhar kar nahin baithte hai, balki us samay ve sainik kaaryon main sahyog dete hai
 In this way, the work of diplomats does not stop during the war, but the form of their work changes
 yuddh kaal main rajnay kaa kaary adhik bad jaataa he
 This is clear from the observation of the events of the last two World Wars
 rajnay kaa swaroop samajhane ke liye yah upyogi he ki videsh niti, anterrashtriya kanoon evam rajanyik raajnneeti se uske sambandh tathaa antar kaa adhyayan kiya jaye
 Dynasties and states of ancient India have a long tradition of diplomacy
 statecraft va rajnay par pracheenatam rachana arthshaastra he, jiskaa shrey kautilya ko jaataa he, jo ki chandragupta maury, maury rajvansh ke sansthaapak kaa pradhan salaahkaar tha, 
 Arthashastra is a complete work on the art of kingship
 isamen rajnay ke siddhant bhi hai, jisamen bataaya he ki paraspar spardhi rajyon ke bich kis prakaar budhimaan raja gathjod banaae or apane shatruon ko gatirodh main daale
 At that time the messengers sent to the courts stopped for a long time
 arthshaastra main duuton ke saath vyavhaar sambandhi nirdesh hai
 It is said that the greatest morality for a king is that his kingdom attains prosperity etc
 rashtriya kaarykram ko puraa karne kii vidhi he, 'niti'
 It can be internal or external
 aantarik niti grih-kaaryon se sambandhit hoti he jabaki videsh niti raashtra kii bahari vyavasthaaon sein
 Foreign policy and diplomacy are the wheels of politics with the help of which international politics operates
 kisi raashtra dwaara anya rajyon ke sandarbh main apane dhyeyon kii purti hi videsh niti he
 It is impossible to think of a foreign policy that ignores national interest
 atah videsh niti kaa arth rajya ke us vyavhaar ke rup main liya jaataa he jiske madhyam se rajya apane hiton kii purti karte hai
 In the ancient era, a state can remain separate by adopting a policy of isolation in itself, it is impossible
 videsh niti kaa nirmaan bahut soch samaj kar kiya jaataa he kyonki isi ke sahi nirnay par hi rajya kaa bhavishya nirbhar karata he
 The state has to take many elements into consideration in the formulation of foreign policy
 udaahranarth, britain va japan kii videsh niti apni bhugolic sthiti se gahare rup se prabhavit rahi he
 The natural resources of the states or their strategic importance etc
 affect the foreign policy of the state
 aviksit rajya, jo vibhinn shaktiyon se sahaayta praapt karte rahete hai tathaa unheen par nirbhar rahete hai, kabhi bhi swatantra videsh niti kaa nirmaan nahin kar sakate hai
 The military power of a country makes its foreign policy enthusiastic and leads it on the wrong path
 germany, italy or japan ne sainik shakti ke kaaran hi apane padosi rajyon par hamalaa kiya or vishwa yuddh kaa aahvaan kiya

 From the writings of the Shangli on the turtle bones found during the excavation of Anyang in Hunan Province, it is known that the people of China were familiar with the art of writing about 3000 years ago
 is praant ke nivaasiyon kaa vishwaas tha ki in asthiyon main jaadu he
 The pandits used to tell the future by watching the cracks caused by burning them on fire

 During the period of the "chu" dynasties, the Chinese had started writing on bronze utensils
 is kaal main chini bhashaa main bahut se nae varno kaa samavesh kiya gaya
 Now people started writing with brush made of hair instead of bamboo or wooden pen
 kramash: uttar main china kii badi diwaar se lekar dakshin kii ore hwai nadi kii ghati tak chini lipi kaa prachaar badha
 Subsequently during the "chhin" reign, Emperor Shih Hwang propagated the Chhin script throughout China to give the Chinese script a shape
 lekin is lipi ke kathin hone ke kaaran sarkari fermaanon ke likhane padhane main bahut dikkat hoti thi, isaliye is samay "li" lipi kaa prachaar kiya gaya jisamen mudi hui rekhaon or golakaar konon ke sthaan par kone kii sidhi rekhaayen banaai jaan lagi
 At this time he started writing on bamboo strips instead of bronze
 is prakaar chini lipi ko suvyavasthit or ekarup banane ke liye china ke log lagaataar parishram karte rahe
 The period of the "han" dynasties and the Chhin dynasties saw the promotion of the cursive and hasty style
 isvi san kii chauthi shatabdi main sulekhak wang shih-chhi ne sundar aksharonvali ek adarsh style ko janm diya jisase adhik vyavasthit, sudaul or chaukor akshar likhe jane lage
 Even today the same style of writing is prevalent in China
 chini ekakshrapradhan bhashaa maani jaati he, yadhyapi dhyaan rakhane kii baat he ki uske ek baar main bole janevaale shabd main ek yaa ek se adhik varna yaa akshar ho sakate hai
 Like Hindi or English etc
, Chinese is not a phonetic language, so different indicative shapes are made for each word or expression
 varnmaala ke abhaav main is bhashaa main prayek shabd yaa bhav ke liye likhaa janevaala varna yaa akshar apane aap main purna hota he or vibhinn upsarg yaa pratyay na lagane se in varnon ke mul main parivartan nahin hota
 Like languages like Hindi, English, etc
, there is not a lot of suffixes or inflections, so that noun pronouns and adjectives do not change with inflectional suffixes
 udhaaharan ke liye ladkaa ladke or ladakon- in vibhinn roopon ke liye chini main ek hi varna likhaa jaataa he- hai ts
 There is also no difference of time, speech, man and feminine masculinity here, from this point of view, it is relatively easy to speak Chinese
 kuch shabdon kaa uccharan karte hue unche neeche surabhed kaa dhyaan avashya rakhana padataa he

 It has been mentioned above that in Chinese language different shapes have to be made for each word or expression

 in aksharon ko seekhney ke liye uskaa uccharan, likhaawat or unke anrth kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he, atev chini lipi kaa siikhnaa kaaphi kathin he
 Sometimes Chinese words are made by combining two letters instead of one letter
 jaise, "prakaash" ke liye surya or chandramaa, "acha" ke liye stri or putr, "purush" ke liye khet or takat, "ghar" ke liye boar or chat, "shanti" ke liye ghar main baithi hui stri, "mitrataa" ke liye do haath, tathaa "vansh" ke liye stri or janm kaa sankethik chihn banaaya jaataa he
 Sometimes the meaning of words formed by the combination of two letters with different meanings changes, namely- shweu adhyayan, vanau likhnaa, shwevanu sahitya; chhingu haraa, nyenu varsh, chhingnyenu yuvavastha; mingu chamkila, tyenu akaash, mingtyenu kal; shiu pashchim, hungau laal, shihau fal, shi hung shihau tamaato; tsau apane aap, laayau aana, shweu pani, piu kalam, ts laay shwe piu fountain pen;u chungau madhya, hwau phool, renu aadmi, minau janata, kungau saadhaaran, hau ekta, cou desh, chung hwa rain min kung ha kou chini lok janatantr
 Chinese language is counted among the rich languages of the world in terms of ability, fluency, grammaticality and lexicon to express emotion
 lekin compojing, typing, taar bhejnaa, samachaarpatron ko report bhejnaa, koshanirmaan or praudh-shiksha-prachaar aadi kii drushti se yah kaaphi clisht he, isaliye pracheen kaal se hi is bhashaa ke sambandh main sanshodhan parivartan hote rahe hai
 After the entry of Indian Buddhist literature into China after the second century CE, there seemed to be a need for authentic knowledge of the Chinese language of color
 lekin buddha dharm sambandhi hajaaron paribhaashik shabdon kaa chini main anuwaad karnaa sambhav na tha
 Hence these words began to be transcribed into Chinese Chinese
 jaise, bodhisattva ko fusa, amitabh ko ami to pho, shakyamuni ko shih ja moni, stupa ko tha, ganga ko han ha or jain ko chaa en likhaa jane laga
 The history of attempts to write Chinese in Roman script is also very old
 iske atirikt pichley 60 varsho se is lipi ko dhvanyatmak rup dene ke praytn bhi hote rahe hai
 Such an attempt was made in 1911 as an ideal of pronouncement of Peking dialect
 san 1919 main 4 may ke saahitiyik andolan ke pashchaat duruh clasical bhashaa kii jagah bolchaal kii bhashaa ko pradhanta di jane lagi
 In 1951, the Chinese teacher of Janmukti Sena, Chhi Chien Hwa, invented a new method to teach Chinese to uneducated laborers, farmers and soldiers in a short time
 lekin likhane kii kathinaayee isse hal na hui
 To overcome this difficulty, the Central People's Government of New China selected 2000 useful words of Chinese and with their help, textbooks were prepared
 pehle kisi shabd ke uccharan se ek se adhik artho kaa bodh hota tha, yaa bahut se shabd ek se adhik prakaar se likhe jate the, lekin ab yah baat nahin he
 Along with simplifying old words, some new words have also been invented
 china kii sarkaar ne peking boli ko adarsh maanakar 26 aksharon kii varnmaala taiyaar kar chini lipi ko dhvanyatmak rup diya he jisase chini kaa siikhnaa saral ho gaya he
 Previously, if it used to take 400 hours to learn 2000 words, now knowledge of such words can be achieved in only 100 components
 1956 main, china janavaadee ganraajya kii sarkaar sarlikrut chini aksharon ke saarvajanik ek set karne ke liye seekhney, padhane or chini bhashaa aasaan lekhan banane ke liye banaaya he
 In Mainland China and Singapore, people use these simple characters
 honkong, taiwan or anya sthanon par jahaan ve chini bolte hai, logon ko abhi bhi or adhik paaramparik varna kaa upyog karen
 The Korean language also uses Chinese letters to represent some words
 japani bhashaa unhen or bhi adhik baar upyog karata he
 These characters are known in Korean as Hanja and in Japanese as Kanji
 ek acchhee shiksha ke saath ek chini vyakti aaj 6,000-7,000 akshar jaanata he
 3000 Chinese characters are needed to read a Mainland newspaper

 In this way, most of the investment is now treated as "institutional investment", even though most of the funds are for the benefit of individual investors
