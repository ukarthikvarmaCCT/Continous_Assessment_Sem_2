 Microscopy or microscopy is a branch of science, in which micro and microscopic organisms are able to enlarge, which is not possible to see with ordinary eyes
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy sookshmjeev sansar kaa adhyayan karnaa hota he
 It uses light reflection, refraction, diffraction and electromagnetic radiation
 vigyaan kii is shakha mukhya prayog jeev vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 Microscopy is used to control diseases and discover new drugs around the world
 sookshmdarshan kii teen prachlit shakhaon main optical, electron evam scanning prob sookshmdarshan aate hai
 The subject of microscopy is thought to have originated in the early 17th century
 isi samay jab vaigyanikon or abhiyantrikon ne bhautikee main lens kii khoj kii thi
 After the invention of the lens, it was possible to see objects larger than their original size
 isse pani main paae jane vaale chote or anya ati sookshm jantuon kii gatividhiyon ke darshan sulabh hue or vaigyanikon ko unke bare main naye tathyon kaa gyaan hua
 Only after this, the scientists also came to know that the vast world is waiting for them about the living world and how little their knowledge was till now
 microscopy kii shakha ke rup main drushti sambandhi sookshmdarshan kaa janm sabase pehle mana jaataa he
 It is also called light microscope
 jeev-jantuon ke angon ko dekhne ke liye iskaa prayog hota he
 Light microscopes are relatively expensive but better equipment
 sookshmdarshan ke kshetra main electron sookshmdarshi kii khoj atyant mahatvapurn mile kaa pathar mana jaataa he kyonki isaki khoj ke baad vastuon ko unke vaastavik aakaar se kai hajaar guna bada karke dekhnaa sambhav hua tha
 It was discovered in the twentieth century
 haalanki electron microscope anya sookshmdarshiyon se mahangaa hota he or prayogshaala main iskaa prayog karnaa chaatro ke liye sambhav nahin hota, lekin iske parinaam kaaphi behatar hote hai
 The images obtained from this are very clear
 sookshmdarshan main ek anya takanic kaa prayog hota he, jo electron sookshmdarshan se bhi behatar maani jaati he
 In this, the object is tested from many angles using hand and needle
 graham sten ne isi prakriya main sabase pehle jeevanu ko dekha tha
 Microscopy is an integral part of physics
 aaj sookshmdarshi kaa upyog kaaychikitsa, jeevigyaan, shailavigyaan, maapvigyaan, crystalavigyaan evam dhaatuon or plastic kii talakriti ke adhyayan main vyapak rup se hi ho rahaa he
 Today, microscopes are not only used for viewing objects, but also for measuring, counting and weighing particles of liquids
 manushya kii pravriti sadaa hi adhik se adhik jaanane or dekhne kii rahi he, isi se vah prakruti ke rahasyon ko adhik se adhik suljhaana chahta he
 Our senses have limited ability to function, and so is our eyes
 isaki bhi apana ek seemaa he
 a very distant object that cannot be seen with an empty eye can be seen with a telescope or a detailed description of a very close object can be seen more clearly than a microscope
 yahan sookshmdarshi ke kshetra main 1865 i
 se ab tak jo pragati hui he usee kaa ullekh kiya ja rahaa he: a single convex lens, commonly called a magnification lens, can be called the simplest microscope
 ise 'jebi sookshmdarshi' bhi kehete hai
 a simple microscope is made of a combination of two convex lenses located at a certain distance
 padaardh kii taraf lage lens ko abhidrishyak lens or aankh ke paas lage lens ko 'abhinytra lens' kehete hai
 The field of view of such a microscope is limited
 isamen sudhaar kii aavashyaktaa he
 Adding a lens to the optical lens increases the area and reduces defects caused by spherical chromatography and chromatic chromatography
 aise sookshmdarshi ko sanyukt sookshmdarshi yaa prakaash sookshmdarshi yaa paramparaagat prakaashiya sookshmdarshi kehete hai
 Although the laws of reflection, refraction, and linear transmission of light were known to Greek philosophers a few centuries before Christ, the law of incidence of incidence and sine of angle of refraction was not invented until the late seventeenth century
 holland ke snaill or france ke dekart ne alag-alag iskaa avishkaar kiya
 Alhazain, the Arabian astrologer around 1000 AD, formulated the laws of reflection and refraction, but they were not in the sine, but in a long distance
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki uske paks ek bada lens tha
 The microscope starts from here
 sookshmdarshi nirmaan kaa shrey ek vanaspatijna jekarios jonamids ko he
 According to Hygge, the invention is attributed to Cornelius Drabble
 aibe ke samay tak sookshmdarshi kii paristhiti aisi hi rahi
 In 1870, Abe laid the foundation of a microscope
 unhone suprasiddh tailanimjjan takneekee nikaali
 This achieved the best contrast and magnification
 par jahaan tak parasookshmakanon ke adhyayan kaa sambandh tha, vaigyanik abhi bhi apane ko asahaay anubhav kar rahe the
 In 1873 AD, Abe felt that no matter how perfect the microscope is to be perfected, the fineness of its particles in a substance can be seen only to a certain extent
 keval aankhon se parmaanu yaa anu ko dekhnaa asambhav he kyonki hamaare netron dwaara sookshm vastuon ko dekhne kii ek seemaa he
 This limitation is not only due to the imperfection of the equipment but also due to the nature of light waves to which our eye is sensitive
 yadi hamen dhaatuon ko dekhnaa he to hamaare jaivikividon ko ek aise nae kism ke netron kaa vikaas karnaa hoga jo un tarangon ko grahan karen jo hamaare vartmaan saadhaaran netron, yaa drushtitantrika ko sugrahya hone vaali tarangon kii apeksha hajaaron guna choti hai
 In fact, two adjacent points in an object can never be distinguished if the wavelength of the light in which those points are observed does not exceed twice the distance between those points
 is prakaar se yah unke bilgau ko simit kar detaa he
 This is called the limit of resolution
 ganit main ise nimnlikhit sambandh dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Limit of differentiation jahaan N
A
 sankhyatmak dwarak he or N
A
 = sin 
 Here u is the refractive index of object distance
 q vah kone he jo rim kiran prakaashik aksh ke saath banaati he
 Thus, considering the radiation of vision, the minimum resolution distance is around 3000 a °
 sabase choti parabegni or avarakt kirnon ke liye yah seemaa kramash: 1500 A° or 3850 A° ke lagbhag hogi, jahaan 1 A° = 10-8 semi

 Let us think of ourselves as former microscopists and consider the reforms that we wanted to do at that time
 saadhaarant: ham apni aashaaon ko chaar baton par kendrit karte hai: The above mentioned improvements or difficulties with the nature of the object, the type of illumination and the photography technology invented the x ray in 1895
 parantu san 1912 tak eks kiran kii tarang prakruti kaa koi pataa nahin tha jab tak vaan laue ne use siddh nahin kiya
 Now it was hoped that X-ray microscopes could be made
 at: us samay yah vichaar tyaag diya gaya
 a few years later, in 1923, The Broglie determined the wave nature of the electron, and in 1927 AD Davison and Germer in New York and GP in Aberdeen
 Tamson confirmed it in 1928 AD
 electron ke kiran punj bhi upyukt vidyut yaa chumbakeey kshetra dwaara mode ja sakate hai
 In 1947, Knoll, Rusk and Brukh presented microscopes that could be successfully used
 is vikiran kaa tarangadairghy nimnlikhit sambandh dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Here h is the constant of Planck, m is mass of electron and q is velocity
 veg voltata kaa falan he, jo electron kiranpunaj kii twarit karne ke liye prayukt hota he
 The resolution of up to 10 a ° was possible with this microscope and its magnification capacity was very high
 iske dwaara 1

10-8 mimi vistaar kii vastuen dekhi ja sakati hai
 This is undoubtedly a major advance and many new inventions are associated with it
 aaj electron sookshmdarshiki kii apni anek takneekiyaan hai
 Like high-energy electrons, x rays have very high solubility and are less quickly absorbed, as are high-energy electrons
 at: choti apaardarshee vastuon kii aantarik sanrachana gyaat karne main eks kirane prayukt kii ja sakati hai
 Ehrenwerk drew the first X-ray microscope or shadow microscope in 1947 and was corrected in 1948 by Kink Patrick and Bejoy
 electron sookshmdarshi kii tarah yahan nirvaat kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Only fine holes are required for good reflection
 iskaa arth he ki isse kam vikiran pravesh karata he or isiilie udbhasana bahut bada hota he
 The back has to enlarge the picture for which an emulsion of very fine particles is required
 ab ham saamaanya drishy prakaash sookshmdarshiki kii ore dekhen
 Before we discuss the progress made in that direction, we have to keep in mind the aspirations of microscopists 40 years ago
 ekmaatr upkaran se sab aavashyaktaaon kii saath hi purti sambhav na thi
 The increase in resolution is limited by the value of a numerical gateway whose value cannot exceed 1
5
 pranali kii aavardhan kshamta kii vruddhi kii bhi ek seemaa hoti he
 It is a function of the focus distances of the used laces
 aavardhan focus duuri kaa pratilom falan he, at: focus duuri kii kami se aavardhan bad jaataa he
 But at the same time the functional distance is destroyed
 aise hi vichaaron ke kaaran lens ke sthaan main darpanon ke upyog se paravarti sookshmdarshi kaa nirmaan barch ne bristol main 1947 i
 main kiya
 In principle, the use of radiation up to ultraviolet rays was possible here
 iskaa sankhyik dwarak kam hota he par avarnataa or adhik kriyaatmak duuri kaa isamen laabh hota he
 Since quartz does not absorb radiation up to 2000 a °, the minimum resolution distance would be 1,000 a ° would be obtained from a microscope using quartz lenses, thus using an ultraviolet radiation with this type of configuration is called an 'ultraviolet microscope'
 Is constructed
 yadi saamaanya prakaash sookshmdarshi kaa upyog choti vastuon dwaara bikhare vikiran ko ekatra karne ke liye hota he to is prakaar kii vyavastha ko parasookshmdarshi kehete hai
 Prof
 Zernik used art contrast illumination in microscopes
 is takneekee ko kala vaishamy sookshmdarshiki kehete the
 It is a method of showing the structure of colorless especially transparent materials
 vibhinn sanrachanaon ke kaaran unamem krambhang dekha jaataa he, jaise mechak ke yakrut main
 Biologists seek the help of pigments to improve the contrast
 praaia: vaishamy varna filter se aisa kiya jaataa he
 Only a few types of crystals can be analyzed with polarized light, but all types of crystals can be studied with artesunate
 is takneekee main abhiranjan ke rup main kritrim varnon kaa upyog nahin hota
 Defects in hygiene are reported to be that although the derangement does not destroy the cells of organisms, it cannot be said that it does not affect the organisms or cells at all
 kala-vaishamy-vidhi kaa laabh yah he ki pradipti jo prayek sookshmdarshi main aavashyak he, jeev ko dekhne ke liye or kuch karnaa nahin padataa
 In the art contrast microscope, the microscope remains the normal type
 isamen keval yah naveenta rahati he ki ek naveen prakashmay yukti jod di jaati he
 p is a glass plate with a circular groove
 plate par calcium fluoride kaa paardarshak lep chadha rahata he
 The thickness of the paste remains the same
 nirvaat main vaashpan dwaara lep chadhaaya jaataa he
 The thickness of the coating remains so that the time difference between the light passed by the groove and the other part of the plate is a quarter of the vibration
 da pardaa he jisamen ek valayakaar kaat hoti he jisase abhidrishyak main utana prakaash paarit hota he jitna kalapatt ke khaanche main bharegaa
 The light dispersed and diffracted by the object is not passed through the groove and when this light reaches the reflection, it is not mixed with the light directly reaching the source and the image is formed
 abhinaytrak main yahi pratibimb dikhaai padataa he
 Different parts of the object display different frequencies in light according to the refractive index, so the reflection seen in the actress is a refractive figure of the object
 yah sookshmdarshi 1952 i
 tak prayog ke liye uplabdh ho gaya
 In 1952, Prof
 Zernik received the Nobel Prize for this achievement
 dison ne 1951 i
 main is samasya ko bhinn rup se suljhaayaa jiske falswaroop unhone vyatikaran sookshmdarshi kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen paramparaagat kalavaishamy sookshmdarshi se kuch shreshthata thi
 In this, the object is pressed into the middle of two semicircular plates of glass and is seen with a special mirror system in such a way that some light goes straight through the object without passing through the object and the remaining light passes through the object
 is prakaar utpann vyaktikaran finj vastu kii apvartanaank sanrachana ko vyakt kar detaa he
 In fact, this two types of illumination are a means of great importance for a blurred background and artistic human
 dhundli prishthbhumi pradipti atyant sookshm kanon ko dekhne main upyogi siddh hui he or kala vaishamy pradipti se prakaashiya ghanatv main nunatam parivartan jaanane kii takneekee kii sambhaavna bad gai he jisase pratibimb kii vyakhya badi aasaani se kii ja sakati he
 We see that many aspirations of microscopists of forty years ago have been fulfilled
 iskaa yaheen ant nahin he kyonki kisi shodh kaa ant nahin hota or yahi baat sookshmdarshiki ke liye bhi he or aavardhan kshamta ke vibhedan kshamta kii upar di gai seemaa kii vruddhi ke prayaas ab bhi ho rahe hai
 With the use of new types of glass and plastic, further advancement in the technology of microscopy is necessary
 in sab sookshmdarshiyon se, jinka varnan kiya gayaahai, keval vistaar main hi vibhedan praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 There is another branch of microscopy which is very spectacular and interesting
 yah prakaash vibhedan sookshmdarshiki he 
 Through this, depth resolution can also be detected
 yah gaharaai main vibhedan karne main utkrisht siddh hua he
 It is an optical and expressive technique known as light cut, light profile, multiple beam beam, fizo fringe and similar color gradient fringe
 in prishthiya chaanbin kii sugrahya vidhiyon main anvik pariman tak safaltaapurvak vibhedan kiya ja saktaa he
 The efficiency of these microscopes would never have been possible if a device had not been developed to make metallic film more reflective by depositing it on the surface
 kuch avyavsaayik sookshmdarshan chitra: 100X face of a fox chaaval kii jad 400X Branche testicle 100X fern porothalium 400X In Jainism, Samavasharana is used for the "refuge of all", the divine preaching building of the Tirthankara
 Equilibrium is made up of a combination of two words, "even" and "opportunity"
 jahaan sabko gyaan paane kaa samaan avasar mili, vah he samavasharan
 It is made by the Devas only after the Tirthankara attains enlightenment
 Samavasaran is quite prevalent in "jain art"
 samavasharan main tirthankar ek komal gaddi par virajman hote he parantu use choote nahin he | tirthankar ke paas unke ganadhar virajte he
 All others sit like this: jain grantho ke anusaar, samavasharan main chaar chaudee sadake hoti he jiname har sadak par ek manastambh hota he
 The total size of the building depends on the height of the people in that era
 samavasharan main tirthankar purv disha kii or mukh karke virajte he, par aisa prathit hota he kii vah chaaron dishaao main dekh rahe he
 Tirthankara preaches Jain philosophy easily
 sabhi jeev is upadesh ko sunate he, or ahimsa ke maarg par agarsar hote he

 Drips irrigation or 'drip irrigation', is a special method of irrigation in which water and manure are saved
 is vidhi main pani ko paudhon kii jadon par buund-boond karke tapakaaya jaataa he
 For this purpose a network of valves, pipes, tubes and emitters have to be installed
 ise 'tapak sinchai' yaa 'buund-buund sinchai' bhi kehete hai
 Drip or droplet irrigation is an irrigation method in which water is transported to the roots of plants directly by plastic drains at short intervals
 paramparaagat satahi sinchai dwaara jal kaa uchit upyog nahin ho paata, kyonki adhiktar pani, joki paudhon ko milanaa chahie, jameen main ris kar yaa vashpikaran dwaara vyarth chalaa jaataa he
 Therefore, in order to make the right and full use of available water, an irrigation system is necessary through which water leakage is minimized and maximum water is available to the plant
 kam dabaav or niyantran ke saath sidhe fasalon kii jad main unki aavashyaktaanusaar pani dena hi tapak sinchai he
 The process of supplying fertilizer to plants through drip irrigation is called fertilization, which provides proper crop nutrition at the right time by curbing nutrient leaching and evaporation losses
 tapak sanyantra ke pramukh bhaag nimnanusaar hai- 1- header assembly 2- filters - hydrocyclone, sand or screen filters 3- Chemicals and fertilizers - venturi, fertilizer tanks 4- menline 5- Submen line 6- volve 7- Lateral line 8- emitors - online / inline / mini sprincolor / jetts Header assembly means bypass, non return valve, air release valve etc
 tapak sinchai kaa dabaav or gati niyantrit karne ke liye bypass assembly kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The drippers are likely to be closed due to soil particles, waste, algae etc
 present in the water
 is prakriya main screen filter, sand filter, sandseparator, setling tanks aadi kaa samavesh hota he
 Hydrocyclone filters should be used if there is sand or mud in the water
 pani main shaiwal, paudhon ke pattey, lakdi aadi sookshm jaivik kachra ho to sand filter dena jaruri he
 At least the screen filter should be used in the irrigation plant even if the water is completely clear
 sand filter kaa dhakkan kholkar baikwash chaalu karne ke baad filter ke andar haath se ret ko achche se todna chahie
 Allow the water coming from the filter out of the lid
 haath se ret saaf karte samay andar ke kaale rang ke filter eliments ko dhakka nahin laganaa chahie
 There is a possibility of sand going into the screen filter
 is dauraan bypass volve dwaara pani kaa pravaah nahinikle
 The sand filter should contain half of the sand
 ret kii maatr kam hone par punahnayi ret filter par ankit label tak bharna chahie
 Sand filter sands are fixed-sized pointed sand made from a specific method, rather than river-stream sand
 is ret se pani riste samay kachra ret main atak jaataa he
 This process does not occur with ordinary sand
 isaliye sand filter main kabhi bhi nadi-naale kii ret kaa istemaal na karen
 The fine waste not filtered by the sand filter gets stuck in the mesh of the screen filter
 dhire-dhire is kachare ke jamaa hone se jaali par ek parat ban jaati he
 This causes blockage in the work of counterfeiting
 jaali saaf karne se pehle donon taraf ke rabar sil nikaal kar, saaf karne ke pashchaat phir se jaali ke upar thik se feet karnaa chahie
 Otherwise water pressure can pass through the filtrate without water
 tapak sinchai dwaara rasinic khaadon kaa prayog venchuri, fertiliser tanks va fertiliser pump ke madhyam se kiya ja saktaa he
 It is used to transport water from the pump to the submen
 kuen kaa pani menline kii sahaayta se sabmen tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 PVC / HDPE pipes are used in the mainline
 menline kaa pani sabmen dwaara letral tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 PV-C / h-d-p-e-pipe is used for submen
 sabmen jameen ke andar kam se kam dedh se do feet kii gaharaai par rakhte hai
 The control valve at the beginning of the submen and the frush valve at the end are connected to control the pressure and flow rate speed
 pani kaa pravaah or daab niyantrit karne ke liye sabmen ke aage volve lagaaye jate hai
 It is necessary to install air release and vacuum release valves at the beginning of submen
 anyathaa pump band karne ke baad hawa ke saath mitti ke kan andar khinche jane se dripurs ke chhidr band ho sakate hai
 Submen's water is transported throughout the field by polytube
 har ek paudhe ke paas aavashyaktaanusaar politub ke upar dripper lagaaya jaataa he
 Letters are made from L-L-D-P-E-
 yah tapak sinchai kaa pramukh ang he
 The hourly flow and number of online / inline drippers is determined according to the maximum water requirement of the crop
 ubad-khabad jameen par pressure compenesetting dripurs lagane kii salaah di jaati he
 Mini sprinklers / jets: These can be mounted on top of polytubes with the help of extension tubes
 1- har din pump shuru karne ke baad, sanyantra kaa dabaav sthir hone par sand filter kii bacowashing karnaa chahie tathaa hydrocyclon aarambhik safai ke baad har 5-6 ghante yaa pani kii gunvattta ke anusaar samay-samay par filters safkarne chahie
 2- After the filter is cleaned, proper pressure should be controlled with the help of bypasswolves of the header assembly
 upyukt dabaav par chalane vaale sanyantra se pani sabhi jagah samaan maatr main miltaa he
 3- Inspect the fields and get them fixed immediately if there is any breakage or leakage
 paip muda hua yaa dabaa hua ho, to turant sidhaa karen
 4- Whether water falls properly from all drippers of drip plant, care should be taken
 5- tapak - sinchai purna hone ke baad zamin kaa geelaapan sabhi jagah ek jaisaa he yaa nahin, yah dekhnaa chahie
 6- Make sure that the drip is in place
 7- lentral / inline kaa antim chor kholkar pani ko 1-2 minute yahaan se baahar nikalne den
 In the coming times, the production of fruits based on rainfall is becoming very difficult
 din pratidin urvarkon kii badhati keemten tathaa sakht vaataavaran ke niyam jal tathaa urvarkon ke kushal upyog kii taraf ishaara kar rahe hai
 Therefore, fertilization remains the only option for farmers
 tapak sinchai ke saath purnatah ghulansheel urvarkon ke upyog se utpaadan main kai guna vruddhi hui he lekin aamtaur par urvarak paramparaagat urvarkon kii tulana main 10 guna se bhi adhik mahange hai
 Apart from this, the government has not given any subsidy on completely soluble fertilizers
 isliye sarkaar ko yah ranneeti taiyaar kerani chahie jisase kisaanon ko saste daamon main ye urvarak uplabdh ho sake tathaa jagah-jagah jaagrukta shivi kaa aayojan karnaa chahie jisase kisaan nai nai takneekon ko apanaae
 Apart from this, the importance of fertigation is also increasing day by day, which is necessary to standardize properly according to different fruitful plants

 gayatri mahaamantra vedon kaa ek mahatvapurn mantra he jisaki mahatta ke lagbhag baraabar maani jaati he
 It is composed of the Yajurveda mantra 'om Bhurbhuva: Self' and the Rigveda verses 3
62
10
 is mantra main savitru dev kii upasna he isliye ise savitri bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is believed that by chanting and understanding this mantra, one attains God
 ise shri gayatri devi ke stri rup me bhi pujas jaataa he
 'gayatri' is also a verse which is one of the seven famous verses of the Rigveda
 in saat chhandon ke naam hai- gayatri, ushnik, anushtup, brihati, viraat, trishtup or jagati
 Gayatri Chanda has three stages of eight-eight letters each
 rugveda ke mantron main trishtup ko chhodkar sabase adhik sankhya gayatri chhandon kii he
 Gayatri has three terms
 atev jab chand yaa vaak ke rup main sristi ke pratik kii kalpana kii jane lagi tab is vishwa ko tripada gayatri kaa swaroop mana gaya
 When the symbolic interpretation of life began to happen in the form of Gayatri, then a special mantra was composed according to the increasing importance of Gayatri verses, which are as follows: us pranaswaroop, dukhanaashak, sukhswaroop, shreshth, tejasvi, paapnaashak, devswaroop paramatma ko ham apni intaraatma main dhaaran karen
 May that God inspire our intellect in the way of life
 yah mantra sarvapratham rugveda main uddhrut hua he
 Its sage is Vishwamitra and the deity is Savita
 vaise to yah mantra vishwamitra ke is sookt ke 18 mantron main keval ek he, kintu arth kii drushti se isaki mahima kaa anubhav aarambh main hi rishiyon ne kar liya tha or sampurna rugveda ke 10 sahasr mantron main is mantra ke arth kii gambhir vyanjana sabase adhik kii gai
 This mantra has 24 letters
 unamem aath aath aksharon ke teen charan hai
 But in the Brahmin texts and in all the literature of the period, the complete form of the mantra was stabilized in this way by adding three vyahitras before these letters and before them Pranav or Onkar
 mantra ke is rup ko manu ne sapranava, savyahritika gayatri kaha he or jap main isi kaa vidhaan kiya he
 What is the Gayatri element and why this mantra has so much glory, it is necessary to address this question
 aarsh manyata ke anusaar gayatri ek ore virat vishwa or duusari ore maanav jivan, ek ore devtatv or duusari ore bhootatatva, ek ore man or duusari ore praan, ek ore gyaan or duusari ore karm ke parsparik sambandhon kii puri vyakhya kar detii he
 The deity of this mantra is Savita, Savita is the noun of Surya, there are many forms of Surya, among them Savita is the form which inspires all the devas
 jaagrath main savitarupi man hi maanav kii mahati shakti he
 Just as Savita is a god, so too is a god
 man hi praan kaa prerak he
 Gayatri mantra is favored to explain this relationship of mind and soul
 savita man praanon ke rup main sab karmon kaa adhishthata he, yah satya pratyakshsiddh he
 It is said in the third phase of Gayatri
 brahman granthon kii vyakhya he-karmani dhiy:, arthathra jise ham dhi yaa buddhi tatva kehete hai vah keval man ke dwaara honevaale vichaar yaa kalpana savita nahin kintu un vichaaron kaa karmrup main moort hona he
 This is his character
 kintu man kii is karmakshmalakti ke liye man kaa shashakt yaa balishtha hona aavashyak he
 That mind which is required for the induction of sharp action is the Varanya bharga
 man kii shaktiyon kaa to parvaar nahin he
 The fraction of which a man is able to make for himself, while for him, there is a fraction of that sharp
 atev savita ke bharg kii prarthana main vishesh dhwani yah bhi he ki savita yaa man kaa jo divya ansh he vah parthiv yaa bhuton ke dharaatal par avateern hokar parthiv sharir main prakashit ho
 No other wish is found in this Gayatri Mantra
 yahan ek maatr abhilaashaa yahi he ki maanav ko ishwar kii ore se man ke rup main jo divya shakti praapt hui he uske dwaara vah usee savita kaa gyaan kare or karmon ke dwaara use is jivan main sarthak kare
 The three vyahtriyas to the east of Gayatri are also tolerant
 bhu prithvilok, rugveda, agni, parthiv jagat or jaagrath avasthaa kaa suchak he
 Bhuva: Astrology, Yajurveda, the god of air, is a sign of the vital world and self-state

 Dardi or Dardic languages are a subdivision of indo-aryan languages, whose most well-known language is Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaayen uttari pakistan, uttar-purvi afghanistan or bharat ke jammu-kashmir rajya main boli jaatin hai
 Among all the Dardi languages, the status of Kashmiri is the highest because it has its own popular literature and also has the honor of being an official language of India
 pakistan ke chitral zile kii khovaar bhashaa, uttari kashmir main boli jane vaali shina bhashaa or afghanistan ke purvi nuristaan, nangarhaar or kunar rajyon main boli jane vaali pashai bhashaa anya mashhoor dardi bhashaayen hai
 There are no two opinions that Sanskrit, Persian, Punjabi, hindi-urdu etc
 have influence on almost all Dardi languages and many of their words are used in Dardi languages
 lekin bahut bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke dardi bhashaaon ne bhi gair-dardi hindi-arya bhashaaon par apni chhap chodi he
 It is believed that some dialects of Punjabi, Uttarakhand and some other languages have an influence on Dardi
 haalanki is par vivaad jari he, lekin ek dharna yah bhi he ki pracheen kaal main dardi ek bahut bade kshetra main boli jaati thi jo sindhu nadi ke ird-gird or phir himachal or uttarakhand main failaa hua tha
 There are some special things in Dardi languages that make their identity in the entire indo-aryan language family, such that mahapraan consonants are pronounced like hypnotic consonants
 zyaadaatar hid-arya bhashaaon main mahapraan vyanjanon ko vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjan 'kha' ko munh se vaayu-pravaah se bolaa jaataa he jabaki uske milte hue alpapraan vyanjan 'k' ko bahut kam vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he
 This is not the case in Dardic languages
 in bhashaaon main vaayu-pravaah kii bajaay sur badal ke alpapraan or mahapraan vyanjanon main antar kiya jaataa he
 For example, where the word 'bhoomi' is in Sanskrit, there is 'buum' in the Khovar language, in which the voice goes from thick voice to thin tone
 isi tarah se jahaan hindi main mahapraani 'dha' se 'dhuaan' hota he vahaan pashai main alpapraani 'da' se 'duum' hota he
 In Kashmiri there is 'dod' instead of 'milk' in Sanskrit and 'milk' in Hindi
 pashchimi pahari ore punjabi main bhi isi tarah mahapraan ke sthaan par swar-badlaav dekhne ko miltaa he, jaise kii punjabi main hindi ke 'ghar' kii jagah swar badalata hua shabd 'kar' hota he
 Dardi languages often have syllable shifting, in which a vowel around the letter 'r' of the same word changes its place
 yah dardi bhashaaon main prachinkaal se hota aa rahaa he or gandhar kshetra main samraat ashok ke jamaane kii shilaon main bhi yah dekha ja saktaa he, jo 269 ipu se 231 ipu main khadi kii gai thim
 One title of Emperor Ashoka was 'priyadarshi' - but 'priyadrashi' is often seen on these rocks because of the syllable shifting, 'drisha' of 'darsha' became
 isi tarah in shilaon par 'dharm' ke sthaan par 'dhram' miltaa he
 In modern times, the word 'long' in Sanskrit can be seen in the word 'drig' in Kalash languages
 palula bhashaa main sanskrit kaa 'durbal' badal kar 'druble' ban jaataa he or sanskrit kaa 'bhurj' badal kar 'barhuj' ban jaataa he
 The ‘poor’ of Sanskrit becomes ‘drolid’ of Kashmiri and ‘karma’ becomes ‘kram’ in Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaaon kii yah pravriti punjabi or pashchimi pahari bhashaaon main bhi kuch had tak dekhi ja sakati he
 In Persian, where the tree is called 'dukht', in Punjabi it becomes 'drakht'
 adhiktar hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he
 But in Dardic languages, verb words come in the middle of a sentence
 is maamle main dardi bhashaayen angrezi kii tarah hotin hai
 In the sentences written above, the verb is written in thick letters
 jaisaa kii spasht he, lagbhag sari hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, lekin dardik is niyam ko bhang karti he or angrezi kii tarah kriya ko sangya ke baad daalati he
 Such languages that are inserted after the verb noun are called "verb second languages"

 Two colors, red and green, have been used in the main body of the flag
 iske alaava paharaaya jane vaala bhaag anya rup main alankrita kiya gaya he
 The current flag is a modernization of the 1951 flag which was the Republic of the Soviet Union of the country
 soviet sanskaran main hathaudaa or hansiya fahraane ke upari bhaag main sthit the tathaa alankrita rangon ko ulta kar diya gaya he
 The various flags used by government officials and agencies were based on the national flag
 pratisthapit karne ke baavjood, belarus kaa purana dhvaj vartmaan belarusi raashtrapati alexander lukshanko ke virodhiyon dwaara kaam main liya jaataa he
 The former flag was made of red horizontal stripes in the middle with a white background
 yah belarusi rashtriya ganraajya or soviet sangh se 1991 main swatantraaa ke baad kaam main liya jaataa tha
 1918 - 1919, 1991–1995 Flag 1918-1919, 1991–1995 rashtriya kul chihn Apart from the national flag, the national anthem and the national anthem, Belarus also has various unofficial symbols
 cross of euphroseyna, 12veen sadi kaa smarak chihn jo dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke samay gaayab ho gaya tha, ko belarus kaa aadhyatmik pratik mana jaataa he
 The European wild bull, commonly called Vicente, is seen as a symbol of the Belarus and Belavezha forests

 But nowadays it is used in a wide sense and it is used in diverse fields of knowledge, including classification of animals

 The word 'class' is used in two ways - jis tarah karyaalayon main bhinn bhinn kaary sambandhi likhit patr pruthak-pruthak filon main rakhe jate hai, usee tarah adhyayan ke liye yah aavashyak he ki vibhinn jatiyon ke jantu or paudhe vibhinn shreniyon main rakhe jaaen
