 uparokt tathyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue samooh mutual fund or samuhik nivesh yojanaon ke unit dharakon ko namakan suvidha pradaan karne ke liye ek praavdhaan shaamil karne ke liye sebi adhinium main upyukt sanshodhan karne kii sifarish karti he
 The Group was informed that SEBI receives countless requests from various market participants for advance guidance on interpretation of the provisions of SEBI Act and Regulations
 chunki sebi adhinium main sebi ko agrim vinirnay pradaan karne kaa adhikaar dene ke liye iskar adhinium 1961 kii dhara 245bi se 245en kii tarah vishisht praavdhaan shaamil nahin he isliye sebi ne sebi yojana 2003 ke praavdhaanon ke tahat vyaakhyaatmak patr / 'koi karrwai nahin' patr pradaan karne kii ek pranali viksit kii he
 However, the guidelines under this scheme are not the same as the advance rulings given under the Income Tax Act as it is not binding on the SEBI Board
 pratibhuti bazaar ke liye agrim vinirnay se bazaar pratibhaagi ko vastav main prastaavit lenden se pehle uske liye pratibhuti kanoon ke vishesh praavdhaan kii prayojyata par baadhyatamoolak vinirnay praapt karne kii kshamta praapt karne kaa laabh praapt hoga
 The Group felt that the advance ruling system is certainly better than the informal guidance provided under the said scheme as the advance ruling provided by SEBI would be binding on its board
 badhyakaari prabhaav bazaar pratibhaagiyon ko keval adhik aaraam hi pradaan nahin karata he balki yah sampoorn kriyavidhi ko behatar kanoonee darja bhi pradaan karata he
 However, in view of the smooth and satisfactory functioning of the prevailing informal guidance scheme, the group felt that SEBI should analyze this option very carefully as a separate department like the Income Tax Act to take steps towards transfer of advance decisions from the scheme
 More infrastructure will have to be established
 samooh kaa suzav he ki chunki kanoonee taur par agrim vinirnay behatar he isliye uski sweekruti par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he or anaupchaarik maargdarshan yojana ko bhi jari rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The group said that Section 11 of the SEBI Act provides for the promotion and regulation of sros
 haalanki sebi adhinium main sadasyon ke pravesh ke liye vaidhanik shakti vaale upaniyamon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye esaro ke shashaktikaran kaa koi vishisht praavdhaan nahin he
 Further, despite being incorporated in the Companies Act 1956, the SEBI Act does not contain any provision relating to supersession of the Governing Board of the SRO by SEBI or limiting the franchisees of the members of the SRO
 sebi ko is tarah kii shakti pradaan karne ke liye is tarah ke sanshodhano kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya he
 The group stated that SEBI has already formulated the Regulations i
e
 SEBI Regulations 2004 under Section 30 along with Section 11 of SEBI Act for regulation of sros for which sros along with all other entities are also required to get SEBI recognition
 Is required
 ye vinium esaro ko sebi ke anumodan ke saath niyamon or upaniyamon kaa nirmaan karne kii shakti bhi pradaan karata he
 Regulation 23 of the Regulations governing sros provides for the power to withdraw recognition to SEBI
 kathith shakti kii drushti se samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ke paas pehle se hi esaro ko viniyamon ke anusaar apni gatividhiyon ko viniyamit karne ke liye majaboor karne kii apekshit shakti he
 Consequently, there is no need to amend the SEBI Act for this
 samooh kii sifarish ke mutabik sebi adhinium main prastaavit sanshodhan kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Regulations formulated by SEBI should be sufficient to address the concern of SEBI as a regulator of sros
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi adhinium main aisa koi praavdhaan nahin he jo sebi ko apane khud ke adeshon main spasht lipic yaa tankan trutiyon main sudhaar karne kaa adhikaar pradaan karata ho
 The view was also expressed that SEBI does not have the right to review its own orders even in cases when those orders are issued unilaterally
 samooh ne dekha ki "adeshon kii samiksha" un moulik shaktiyon ko pradaan karata hua prathit hota he jo aam taur par mul kshetradhikaar vaale praadhikariyon ke paas nahin hota he
 However, the Group felt that SEBI should be provided with the ability to correct clerical or typographical errors associated with its order, like Section 26 of the Rest of the Loan Amount Recovery Act, 1993
 bank evam vittiya santhaan baaki rin raashi vasuuli adhinium 1993 kii dhara 26 kii tarah sebi ko apane aadesh se judi lipic yaa tankan trutiyon ko thik karne kii kshamta pradaan karne ke liye isamen sanshodhan kiya janaa chahie
 The Group stated that the existing provisions of the SEBI Act do not entitle SEBI to enact retrospective effect regulations with limited purpose of providing relief to market participants
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ko raahat pradaan karne ke simit uddeshy se na ki nai dendariyon or jimmedaariyon kaa boj ladane ke uddeshy se iskar adhinium kii tarah prakriyaatmak maamalon yaa shulk prabhaar se sambandhit maamalon ke sambandh main purvyaapee prabhaav vaale viniyamon kaa nirmaan karne kii shakti pradaan kii ja sakati he
 According to the group such a liberal provision may in some cases overcome the undue hardship of market participants and hence should be given positive attention
 samooh kii sifarish ke anusaar sebi ko simit raahat or laabh pradaan karne ke simit uddeshy se na ki nai dendariyon or jimmedaariyon kaa boj ladane ke uddeshy se prakriyaatmak maamalon yaa shulk prabhaar se sambandhit maamalon ke sambandh main poorvvypit prabhaav vaale viniyamon kaa nirmaan karne kaa adhikaar pradaan karne ke liye iskar adhinium 1961 kii dhara 295 ke anuroop sebi adhinium main sanshodhan kiya ja saktaa he
 The group discussed the suggestion to reform the SEBI Act to provide an overriding effect to the SEBI Act on other laws in the case of securities
 is tarah ke sanshodhan kii jarurat kaa moolyankan karne ke liye samooh ne sebi adhinium ke un moulik praavdhaanon kii pahchaan karne kii koshish kii jo ek adhibhavi prabhaav praapt karne ke laayak ho
 After due consideration, the group felt that there is no such fundamental provision in the SEBI Act that deserves an overriding effect
 samooh ne yah bhi kaha ki jahaan kahin moulik praavdhaan adhibhavi prabhaav praapt karne ke laayak the vahaan sebi adhinium ne pehle se hi gaiyr avine claj dwaara yah kaam kar liya he
 As per the recommendation of the group, the SEBI Act cannot be amended to provide an overriding effect to the SEBI Act over other laws
 samooh ne paripatron or dishanirdeshon ko jari karne ke liye sebi ko vaidhanik adhikaar pradaan karne ke liye sebi adhinium ke praavdhaanon main sudhaar karne ke prastaav kii jaanch kii
 The group said that SEBI has been issuing circulars and guidelines under section 11 of the Act
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ke anternihit adhikaron ke strot dhara 11 ke maujuuda praavdhaanon ke tahat paripatron yaa dishanirdeshon ko jari karne main koi kanoonee dikkat nahin he
 As per the recommendation of the group, it cannot be amended to include a specific provision in the SEBI Act for issuing circulars and guidelines as SEBI already has the inherent right to do so under Section 11 of the SEBI Act 
 samooh ko bataaya gaya ki pratibhutiyon ke kapatpurna nirgaman or pratibhutiyon ke atyadhik ke amurtikaran ityadi ke maamalon main sebi ko is tarah ke lendenon ko shunya ghoshit karne kaa adhikaar diya janaa chahie
 In the event of violation of any specific regulation, suitable provisions should be made in the SEBI Act like Section 9 and Section 14 of SCRA to declare such transactions void
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki is tarah kii shakti kaa prayog kisi swatantra nikaay khaas taur par naagarik adaalaton dwaara kiya janaa chahie
 Such authority cannot be delegated to administrative bodies
 die gaye prastaav ke tahat sebi adhinium ko sanshodhit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Such power or authority should be left exclusively to the civil court
 samooh ko bataaya gaya ki ioessio / ethesaypi ke vinirdeshon ke anusaar pratibhuti viniyamon kaa ek siddhant yah he ki niveshkon kii kshati or haani ko kam karne or vyavasthit jokhim ko shaamil karne ke liye bazaar ke kisi bichauliye kii vifaltaa se nipatane kii prakriya kaa intjaam hona chahie
 The group said that under the SEBI Act to take steps for winding up of such intermediaries if any middleman is deemed to be bankrupt or the continuation of such intermediary is detrimental to the interest of investors or customers of such intermediaries
 No special rights have been conferred on
 samooh ne kaha ki bhartiya reserve bank ke paas arabiai adhinium kii dhara 45 emasi ke tahat gaiyr banking vitt company ke khilaaf samaapan yachika daayar karne kaa adhikaar he
 The group felt that SEBI should have the equivalent right to file a winding up petition under the SEBI Act
 iske alaava samooh ne dekha ki is tarah kii madhyasth company ke samaapan ke maamle main anya daavon yaa karjon par arthath surakshit lendaaron or samprabhu praadhikariyon jaise iskar par bhi is tarah ke bichauliye ke graahakon ke daawey ko variyata di jaani chahie
 In this regard, the Group stated that under Section 43A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, there is a provision to give preference to preferential payment of depositors to all other debts of the assets of the banking company
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ko kisi bichauliye ke diwalia hone yaa is tarah ke bichauliye kii nirantarata ko niveshkon yaa is tarah ke bichauliye ke graahakon ke hit ke liye hanikaarak maane jane par is tarah ke bichauliye ke khilaaf samaapan yachika daayar karne kaa adhikaar pradaan karte samay madhyasth companiyon ke graahakon ke daavon ke sambandh main bhi isi tarah ke praavdhaan kiye jane chahie
 As per the recommendation of the group, suitable provision can be made in the SEBI Act to enable SEBI to file a winding up petition in respect of intermediary companies on the lines of Section 45 MC of the Reserve Bank of India Act and Section 43A of the Banking Regulation Act
 samooh ne kaha pratibhuti bazaar viniyamon ke liye ek ioessio siddhant yah he ki niamak pranali ke madhyam se niveshkon ke dhan ko anya sansthaaon kii parisampattiyon se alag rakhana chahie
 In addition, investors should be protected from deceptive activities, manipulation or fraud, including insider trading, front running or trading in front of clients and misuse of client assets
 samooh ko bataaya gaya ki pratibhuti kanoon vidheyak 2003, ek dhara 27bi ko pratibhuti anubandh adhinium main shaamil karne kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya tha jiske tahat ek niveshak apane paison yaa pratibhutiyon ko kisi aisi madhyasth company ko saunp sake jiske paas is tarah ke paise yaa pratibhutiyaan hongi or jo niveshkon ke nirdesh ke anusaar unka istemaal karegaa
 Such money or securities shall not be a part of the assets of the intermediary companies and such assets of the investors shall not be seized by any authority or any authority shall have any relationship with such assets
 haalanki pratibhuti kanoon adhinium 2005 main yah praavdhaan shaamil nahin tha
 The group stated that the money or securities handed over by an investor to an intermediary company should be held by the trusting intermediary company of such investors
 niveshkon ke aise paison yaa pratibhutiyon ko madhyasth company kii parisampatti kaa hissaa nahin banaaya janaa chahie or niveshkon kii in parisampattiyon ko kisi praadhikari dwaara jabt nahin kiya jayega yaa unke saath kisi bhi praadhikari kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin hoga jo aisi madhyasth company ke sangrakshan yaa kabje main ho
 As per the recommendation of the group, the SEBI Act should have a special provision under which the customers 'money or securities should be held by the intermediary companies as a trust and any possession of any authority over the investors' assets held by the intermediary company
 Or there will be no transaction
 is uddeshy ko puraa karne ke liye pratibhuti kanoon vidheyak 2003 main prastaavit praavdhaan ko pesh kiya ja saktaa he

 phir ye chaaron milakar ek paanchavaa aadmi chune
 These five men together solve the quarrel
 siddharth kaa prastaav bahumat se amaanya ho gaya saath hi shakya senapati kaa yuddh kaa prastaav baari bahumat se paarit ho gaya
 Unable to resolve the dispute with Shakya Sangha and Shakya Senapati, Siddharth eventually had three options
 teen vikalpon main se unhen ek vikalp chunanaa tha sena main bhartee hokar yuddh main bhaag lenaa, apane parivaar ke logon kaa saamaajik bahishkaar or unke kheton kii jabti ke liye raji hona, phaansi par latakana yaa desh nikaala sweekaar karnaa
 He opted for the third option and agreed to leave the country as a transcendent
 parivrajak banakar sarvapratham siddharth ne paanch brahmanon ke saath apane prashnon ke uttar dhundne shuru kiye
 He was able to get proper attention, but he did not get answers to his questions
 fir unhone tapasya karne kii koshish kii
 Even in this work, he became more proficient than his teachers, but he could not find answers to his questions yet
 fir unhone kuch saathi ikaithe kiye or chal diye adhik kathor tapasya karne
 Doing so, after six years, without getting answers to their questions, having passed through death due to hunger, they started thinking of doing something else
 is samay, unhen apane bachapan kaa ek pal yaad aayaa, jab unke pita khet taiyaar karnaa shuru kar rahe the
 At that time, he had fallen into a blissful meditation and he felt as if time had come to a standstill
 kathor tapasya chhodkar unhone ashtangik maarg dhund nikaala, jo bich kaa maarg bhi kehalaata jaataa he kyonki yah maarg dono tapasya or asanyam kii paraakaashthaon ke bich main he
 To infuse some power into his body, he took some milk from a goat
 ve ek pipal ke ped ke neeche baith gayi pratigya karke ki ve satya jane bina uthenge nahin
 At the age of 35, he attained Bodhi and became a Buddha
 unka pahila dharmopadesh varanasi ke paas sarnath me tha
 For the rest of his 45 years, Gautama Buddha gave his sermon around the river Ganges, to both the rich and the poor
 unhone do sanyaasiyon ke sangh kii bhi sthapana jinhone buddha ke dharmopadesh ko failaana jari rakhaa

 Buddha has told the four non-truths

 There is sorrow in birth, in old age, in sickness, in death, in getting away from loved ones, in things with dislike, in not getting desire, in everything
 trishna, yaa chahat, dukh kaa kaaran he or fir se sasharir karke sansar ko jari rakhti he

 Template: Main: Octagonal route buddha dharm ke anusaar, chauthe arya satya kaa arya ashtaang maarg he dukh nirodh paane kaa rasta
 Gautama Buddha used to say that to follow the truth of the Four Noble Truths, one should follow this path: 1
 samyak drushti : chaar arya satya main vishwaas karnaa 2
 samyak sankalp : maansik or naitik vikaas kii pratigya karnaa 3
 samyak vaak : hanikaarak baaten or jhut na bolnaa 4
 samyak karm : hanikaarak karmon ko na karnaa 5
 samyak jeevika : koi bhi pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se hanikaarak vyapaar na karnaa 6
 samyak prayaas : apane aap sudharne kii koshish karnaa 7
 samyak smriti : spasht gyaan se dekhne kii maansik yogyata paane kii koshish karnaa 8
 samyak samadhi : nirvana paanaa or swayan kaa gaayab hona Some people consider the Arya Ashtanga Marg as a path, in which to move forward, it is necessary to attain the level of the previous
 or logon ko lagata he ki is maarg ke str sab saath-saath paae jate he
 The route is classified into three parts: Pragya, Sheel and Samadhi

 The knowledge found from Gautama Buddha is called Bodhi
 mana jaataa he ki bodhi paane ke baad hi sansar se chhutkaaraa paaya ja saktaa he
 Bodhi can be attained only by the perfection of all the parameters, the complete understanding of the four Aryan truths and the prevention of karma
 is samay, lobh, dosha, moh, avidya, trishna or atmaa main vishwaas sab gaayab ho jate he
 There are three levels of Bodhi: ावकravakodhodhi, each Bodhādhi and Samyakasobodhi
 samyaksambodhi bodh dharm kii sabase unnat adarsh maani jaati he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 sabhi buddha sampradaay tathagat buddha ke mul siddhant hi maanate hai
 The theory of pratyatamutpad states that any event exists in a complex cause-and-consequence web only because of other events
 praaniyon ke liye, iskaa arth he karm or vipaak ke anusaar anant sansar kaa chakra
 Because everything is eternal and eternal, nothing really exists
 har ghatana multah shunaya hoti he
 However, humans, who have the power of knowledge, can attain nirvana by abandoning Trishna, which is the cause of sorrow, turning the power destroyed in Trishna into knowledge and meditation
 is duniya main sab kuch kshanik he or nashwar he
 Nothing permanent
 parantu vaidic mat se virodh he
 The soul means 'I'
 kintu, praani sharir or man se bane he, jisame sthayitv nahi he

 isliye, 'mai'arthath aatma naam kii koi sthaayee chiz nahin
 What people consider to be a soul is an uninterrupted flow of consciousness
 aatma kaa sthaan man ne liya he
 Buddha has told how the creation of the universe in brahma-jala Sutra
 sristi kaa nirmaan hona or nasht hona baar-baar hota he

e
 the working-sense
 bhagwaan buddha ke anusaar, manushyon ke du:kha or sukh ke liye karm jimmedaar he, ishwar yaa mahabrahma nahi
 But elsewhere Buddha has called the supreme truth indescribable
 shoonyata mahayan buddha sampradaay kaa pradhan darshan he
 He values people of his own sect
 buddha dharm kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he
 Grief does not mean pessimism, but relativism and realism

 buddha bananaa hi bodhisattva ke jivan kii paraakaashtha he
 This identity is named Bodhi
 kaha jaataa he ki buddha shakyamuni keval ek buddha hai - unke pehle bahut saare the or bhavishya main or honge
 He said that anyone can become a Buddha if he attains the Bodhisattva by following the ten Paramitas in full and attains the ten forces or lands after the Bodhisattva
 buddha dharm kaa antim lakshya he sampoorn maanav samaaj se dukh kaa ant
 "I teach only one substance - there is sorrow, there is a cause of sorrow, there is a cure for sorrow, and there is a way to restrain sorrow"

 The Sangh occupies a large place in Buddhism
 is dharm main buddha, dhamm or sangh ko 'triratn' kaha jaataa he
 Regarding the rule of union, Gautama Buddha said that small rules can make monks change
 un ke mahaparinirvana pashchaat sangh kaa aakaar main vyapak vruddhi hua
 After this growth, different people became attached to Buddha religion on the basis of different region, culture, social stage, initiation, etc
 and the rule of the Sangh started changing gradually
 saath hi main angutar nikaay ke kalam sutt main buddha ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par dharm paalan karne kii swatantrata di he
 Therefore, due to scandal / change in the law of Vinaya, local cultural / linguistic aspect, freedom of individual religion, more or less added to the definite side of religion, due to various reasons, various sects and associations in Buddha religion were scrapped

 Rorschach wears a mask with an ink stain: Haley's blank mask curves have motion-changing signs placed on them, so that animators can create her ever-changing expressions
 Haley found the mask to be "incredibly motivating for the character" due to its controlled design, which was immediately heated

 Haley has a black belt in Kempo, but he describes Rorschach's manner of attack as clumsy and more fierce because the characters are from a boxing background

 John Cusack, a fan of the comic book, showed interest in the role
 Snyder chose Wilson for the role after watching 2006's Little Children, which also starred Haley
 Wilson gained 25 pounds to play the role of the more weighty Dreiberg
 He compared Dreiberg to a soldier who is unable to fit into society after returning from war
 wilson kehete hai ki unhen jis tarah kii ladaai kii style ko nit oul ko dene kaa nirdesh diya gaya, vah "atyaadhik aswabhaavik or shakti samanvay" vaali thi

 Crudup considered it fortunate that he did not have to wear a prosthetic or rubber dress like the other actors and he reminded them of this when he was sometimes mocked for his appearance
 sneader ne paatr ke vishay main bataate hue faisla kiya ki ve manhattan ke liye crudup kii aawaaj ko electronic rup se parivartit nahin karenge, "jahaan tak ho saktaa he, vah prayek ko suvidha dene kaa prayaas karenge, bajaae ki robotic awaz ke jo ki unke vichaar main nakaaree ja sakati thi

 adrian veet / osimandias ke rup main mathew good : ek sevanivruth superhiro jisane apni pahchaan ko saarvajanik kar diya he
 Jude Law, Lee Pace and Tom Cruise were originally considered for the role of Ozymandias, but they dropped the project due to the studio's delay in budget handling
 Snyder says that Good was "big, tall and lean", which led to the character "this handsome, ironic, Aryan superman"

 Due to Veit's description of his birth in Germany, Good used to pronounce his surname as "wyatt"
 good "mere dwaara kii gayi bhoomika nirdhaaran ke bare main bahut adhik chintit tha", use lagata tha ki vah " ke liye shaareerik rup se sahi nahin he
 Still Zac remained adamant and confident and did not let me get in any trouble "
 Snyder says good" fit the bill xxrep 4 
 We found it very difficult when it came to role-playing, because we needed a personable, handsome and intelligent person
 And it's a very difficult mixture "
 edward blake / kamedian ke rup main jeffri dean morgan : ek superhiro, jo america sarkaar dwaara kamishan praapt he
 Before taking Morgan for the role, producers Loren Gordon and Lloyd Levine met Ron Pearlman to discuss the comedian's portrayal
 While reading the comic for the character, Morgan pauses when he sees that his character is killed in three pages
 jab unhonen apane agent se kaha ki vah yah bhoomika nahin nibhaana chaahate hai, to unase kaha gaya ki vah ise padhanaa jari rakhe or pataa lagaaye ki unka paatr kitna mahatvapurn tha
 Morgan found the role challenging, describing that "when reading a novel, for some reason, you don't hate this person, though he does things that are not worth telling
" meraa kaam uskaa anuwaad karnaa he, taaki ek darshak ke rup main aap use pasand karne ke liye bahaane naa banaaen, lekin uske karnaamon kii vajah se aap usase utani nafrat naa karen jitani aapako kerani chahie

 In 1986, producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver obtained Watchmen film rights for 20th Century Fox
 Fox asked writer Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story, but he declined, which led to the studio The screenwriter chose Sem Hamm
 Haim took the liberty to rewrite the "more orderly" ending rather than the complex ending of The Watchmen, which included a murder and occasional contradiction
 In 1991, Fox changed the project, and the project from Warner Bros
 Passed by, where Terry Gilliam was assigned the direction and Charles mckeon rewrote it
 He used the character Rorschach's diary as a voice-over and retook scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed
 gillium or silver film ke liye keval 25 million dollar hi juta paae,, kyonki unki pichhali filmein bajet se kaaphi upar chali gayin thim
 Gilliam left the project, as he believed that Watchmen would not be filmed
 He said, "it seemed to me that reducing the length to two or two and a half hours of film would destroy the essence of Watchmen"
 After Warner Bros
 left the project, Gordon again invited Gilliam to operate the film independently
 nirdeshak ne phir se yah maanate hue inkaar kar diya, ki comic book ko ek paanch ghante ke chote dharawahik ke rup main behatar dhang se nirdeshit kiya ja saktaa tha

 antat, paramount ne wachamen main badlaav shuru kiya
 In October 2005, Gordon and Lewis met with Warner Bros
 to re-develop the film
 At 300, Warner Bros
, influenced by Zack Snyder's work, asked him to direct Watchmen
 Screenwriter Alex Se removed his favorite elements from Hayter's screenplay, but added it back to the original Cold War setting of the Watchmen comic
 Like his approach to the 300, Snyder used the comic book as a narrative piece
 unhone ladaai ke drishy kaa vistaar kiya, or film ko adhik samayik banane ke liye urja sansadhano ke bare main ek upakatha jodi

 In 1951, during the first census of India, Ramesh Bhatt invited Ila to work with him to record the details of the families living in the slums, Ila very hesitantly agreed to it
 unhen pataa tha ki unke mata-pita apni beti ko ek anjaan yuvak ke saath gandi bastiyon main bhatakate dekhnaa haragiz pasand nahin karenge
 Later, when Ila decided to marry Ramesh Bhatt, the parents protested
 unhen dar tha ki unki beti aaajeevan garibi main hi rahegi
 Despite so much opposition, Ila married Ramesh Bhatt in 1955

 1971 main ahmedabad kii bazaar haathgadi khinchne vaali or sar par bojha dhone vaali pravasi mahila kuliyon ne apane sir par chat kii talash main ila bhatta se madad maangi
 Ila Bhatt saw that all these women are forced to live on the open road and their wages are extremely low

 The cloth merchants dismissed all the allegations of Ila Bhatt by publishing a counter-article and claimed to give fair wages to women porters

 This tactic of Ila Bhatt left the arrogance of the textile traders

 In December 1971, a hundred women workers and Seva Sangathan were born for this meeting
 jab seva ko ek mazdoor sanghathan ke rup main panjikrut karne kaa vichaar hua to shram vibhaag ne saafe inkaar kar diya
 The reasoning was that if a labor organization is to be formed, first the name of the owner should be mentioned where these people are on the job
 seva ke sari sadsyaayein asangathit mahila mazdoor thim
 They did not have a regular job
 lambi bahes ke baad hi seva ek panjikrut mazdoor sanghathan ban paaya
 In 1981, the upper castes attacked backward castes in protest against reservation
 seva ne pichhadi va anusuchit jatiyon par ho rahi hinsa kaa purazor virodh kiya jabaki kapadaa kaamgaar sangh maun rahaa
 The menial, racist leadership of the textile workers union became so enraged by the actions of Ila Bhatt fighting for the unorganized women workers, supporting the backward castes that they expelled the service from their organization itself
 ila bhatta ke anusaar yah nishkasana ek vardaan siddh hua
 After this service became the confluence of the women's movement, the workers' movement and the cooperative movement
 ila bhatta ke sanghathan seva kaa mukhya lakshya mahilaon ko sampoorn rojgaar se jodna he
 Total employment does not mean just a job; Rather, there is food security and social security along with the job

 It focuses on three things: building livelihoods, protection of existing livelihoods and increasing efficiency for progress
 seva apane sadasyon ko awaas, bachat or rin, pension tathaa beemaa jaisi sahaayak seva bhi pradaan karti he
 Apart from this, child care and legal assistance are also provided
 seva ne vyavastha parivartan ke kai udhaaharan pesh kiye hai
 For example, Vanlakshmi, the agricultural committee of landless Dalit women in Mehsana district of Gujarat
 is samiti kii striyaan plastic kii chadar se dhanke talab main barsaati pani kaa sangrahan karti hai taaki garmi ke dinon main bhi sinchai kii ja sake
 These women also run power tillers
 aas-paas ke gaanvon se kisaan vanalakshmi main dekhne-seekhney aate hai
 Likewise, in the dry desert region of Banaskantha, women did not have land rights
 iske liye unhen kai dashakon tak sangharsh karnaa pad saktaa tha
 But the Mahila Pani Panchayat formed by the organization of working women made women the owners of water
 isi pani kii milkiyat ke chalate ve zamin kii maalik bhi banati chali gayin
 The village-dominated power relations also changed due to the control gained through water
