 The process of selling products with huge discount offers by Indian e-commerce will not last long in the market as people investing in these companies will soon start demanding returns on their investment
 aisa aditya birla group ke chairman kumaar mangalam birla kaa kahana he
 Birla expressed surprise at the trend of selling products with huge discount offers by e-commerce companies in the country and said that this would not benefit the e-commerce companies for long
 birla ne kaha ki desh main vaastavik utpaadan kar apana utpaada sidhe kanjumar ko bechney vaali companiyon ko bhi ritel bazaar main i-commers companiyon ke saath level plaing field milanaa chahie
 Birla claimed that there will be pressure on those investing in these e-commerce companies to increase the return on investment one day because they too can flow the capital to a level
 ek angreji bijness akhbaar ko die intervyuu main birla ne kaha 'mujhe hairat hoti he ki i-commers is tarah se kaise chalaaya ja saktaa he
 i play valuation
 ek din in kaarobaar ke finanshal invester ko ritern bhi chahie hoga
 So it is clear that unlimited funding cannot be done in these areas
 ise dekhte hue is mote discount vaale model ke tikaoo hone par mere man main sawaal uthta he
 It is worth noting that Birla's name had come up with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the recent CBI FIR registered in the coal block allocation case
 is mudde par bolte hue birla ne kaha ki company in aaropon ke dabaav se baahar nikalne main safal hui he
 How e-commerce companies are offering huge discounts: In the country, e-commerce giants like Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal are working as platforms to link Bayer and Seller under FDI rules
 aisa isliye kyonki kanoon ke mutabik un i-commers companiyon main epadiai kii anumati nahin he jo kanjumar ko sidhe utpaada kii bikri kar sake
 Hence their internet site works on the lines of a platform where producers and consumers can meet
 yah placeform pement, storage or delivery jaisi services bhi muhaiyaa karti hai
 However, he does not have the right to determine the price of the product sold on the internet platform as well as to give a discount
 niveshkon ke paise se diya ja rahaa he discounti-commers companiyaan celler dwaara die ja rahe discount ko bair tak pramotional ofer ke naam par sidhe badha de rahi hai
 Due to this, consumers are finding products cheaper on the Internet than in the direct retail market and they are increasingly attracted to online shopping
 i-commers companiyaan apane capital investment se is discount kii bharpai kar le rahe hai

 Surprisingly, the state government or agencies are unable to formulate a concrete plan to deal with different causes of pollution
 is bich sardiyon ke mausam se thik pehle mukhyamantriaravind kejarivalane pradooshan se nipatane ke liye padosi rajyon kaa saath maanga he

 Currently, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has tweeted and appealed to the government of the neighboring states of Delhi to join him

 The problem of pollution in Delhi is not domestic and this problem can be overcome only by mutual cooperation of neighboring states

 paraali kii samasya se nipatane ke liye dilli ke padosi rajya rajasthan, punjab, haryana or uttar pradesh kii sarkaar ko saath aana hoga
 Funds are also given to farmers not to burn stubble, but do ministers of all states sit in a room and discuss? However, instead of finding the real solution, politics is happening only

 The government formation in Maharashtra continues to be high
 NCP ke baad congress ke samarthan ke elaan ke baad shivasena (shiv Sena) kii sarkaar bananaa lagbhag tay mana ja rahaa he
 In this way, Kumar Vishvas, in his own style, targeted the BJP (BJP), taking the media in the circle of questions
 kumaar vishwaas ne apane twitor acanut par likhaa ki pichley anek avasaron par haryana, bihar, kashmir, karnataka aadi pradeshon main, prayek dal dwaara kiye gaye mauqaaprast va aniatik gathbandhanon ko “master-stroke” bataate aa rahe channelon ke charchaa-chakravarti ankaron ke munh se maharashtra ke bahaane “naitikta par pravachan” sunanaa kitna kute lag rahaa he
 On the last several occasions in the states of Haryana, Bihar, Kashmir, Karnataka etc
, the discussion on the channels of the opportunistic and unethical alliances made by each party as "master-stroke" - Maharashtra's excuses from the mouth of the chakravarti anchors "discourse on morality" How cute it is to hear xxrep 24 ? Is in power with any party or has been in power
 haal hi haryana main vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan bijepi ne dushyant chautaala kii party jananaayak janata party ke saath gathbandhan kiya
 Apart from this, in Bihar BJP is in power with JDU, then in Kashmir BJP ever formed a government with PDP, whereas in Karnataka, let me tell you that after a lot of upheaval, BJP was able to hold power
 aise main kumaar vishwaas kaa ishaara kis taraf he iskaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Let us tell you that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP has got 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats
 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke anushangik sanghathan swadeshi jaagran manch ne piem modi ko letters likhakar tik tok jaise chini soshal media ap ko bain karne or sabhi mobile phone se hataane kii maang kii he
 The forum, which has not helped in declaring jaish-e-mohammed chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist, has called China an "enemy country" and said that all Chinese companies and Chinese apps in India should be immediately banned
 swadeshi jaagran manch kaa yah bayaan kashmir main siarpief ke 40 javaanon kii shahadat ke chaar din baad aayaa he
 According to the Economic Times, in its letter to PM Modi, the organization has said that it is the duty of all Indians to stop the economic benefits to any country or person who directly or indirectly supports terrorists
 swadeshi jaagran manch ne apane bayaan main kaha, 'aise samay main hamaara yah maananaa he ki sarkaar chini companiyon ke raste main usee tarah se roda atkaaye, jo apane phaayde ke liye bharat kaa istemaal kar rahi hai
 As it is often said that data is the new oil, we should not allow Chinese companies to acquire Indian users without any hindrance or surveillance
 'gauratlab he ki bharat sarkaar ne bhi haal main aisi niti laane kaa prastaav rakhaa he, jisase soshal media plateform par contint shering ko aasaan banane vaale madhyasth ap ko zyada javabdeh banaaya ja sake
 This will impact many of China's social media apps which are quite popular among the country's teenagers
 kishoron main lokapriy aise hi ek ap tik tok (tik Tok) ke bharat main kareeb 20 karod yujar hai, jabaki puri duniya main uske kul yujar 50 karod hai
 In the last few years, Chinese social media and e-commerce companies have expanded rapidly in the country and experts do not consider it appropriate for national security
 kaha jaataa he ki tik tok or helo jaise ap child pornography or raashtra virdohi gatividhiyon ko badhaava mil saktaa he
 Swadeshi Jagran Manch has written in its letter, 'we have to ensure that Indian startups are not harmed by such Chinese companies
 chini companiyon ke paas bharpoor nakadi hoti he or isaki vajah se ve bhartiya starop ke tantra ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Not only this, they can also threaten our data sovereignty and our national security
 'sanghathan ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar ko desh main chini telecom companiyon ke kaarobaar par bhi ankush lagaana hoga
 Accordingly, Chinese companies have acquired a number of important and sensitive 4G contracts in India and are now trying to make inroads in the 5G sector as well
 isse suraksha par khatra kai guna bad jayega
 Perhaps the organization is referring to companies like Huawei and JTE
