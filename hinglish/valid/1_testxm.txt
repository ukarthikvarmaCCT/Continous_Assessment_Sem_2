 stryptococal grasanishoth yaa strape throt ek aisa rog he jo ek aise jeevanu dwaara utpann hota he jise “samooh e stryptococas”kaha jaataa he
 The strep throat affects the throat and tonsils
 galtundika gale main sthit, do granthiyanhoti hai jo munhake peeche hoti hai
 The strep throat can also affect the sound generator
 saamanyalakshanonmen bukhaar, gale main dard, tathasuji hui granthiyaan jo galemen sthit hoti hai, aadi shaamil hai
 Strep throat accounts for 37% of the causes of soreness and pain in children
 strape throt kisi biimaar vyakti se nazadiiki sampark dwaara failata he
 To confirm strep throat in a person, a test called a throttle culture is required
 is pareekshan ke bina bhi, strape throt kii sambhavit upasthiti ko iske lakshanon se pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Antibiotic can provide comfort to a person suffering from strep throat
 pratijaivik ve dawaaen hai jo jeevanuonko samaapt karti hai
 They are mainly used for the prevention of complications such as rheumatic fever and not for shortening the duration of the disease
 strape throt ke saamaanya lakshanon main shaamil he- gale main karaash tathaa dard, 38°se
 se adhik bukhaar, galtundika par pas tathaa suje hue lymph nodes
 Some other symptoms may also occur such as: kisi biimaar vyakti se sampark main aane ke do yaa teen dinon ke baad kisi vyakti main strape throt ke lakshan dikhne shuru hote hai
 Example of strep throat
 Notice the large mottus with white pus
 strape throt kaa udhaaharan
 chote laal chaktton par dhyaan dijiye
 yah laal chakatta ek asaamaanya lekin vishisht lakshan he
 An example of strep throat in an 8 year old child
 Notice the large gullet covered with white pus in the back of the throat
 strape throt ek prakaar ke jeevanu dwaara utpann hota he, jise samooh e beta-limolitic stryptococas kehete hai
 Other bacteria or viruses may also cause a sore throat or pain
 kisi biimaar vyakti se pratyaksh, nazadiiki sampark dwaara logon ko strape throt hota he
 The disease spreads more easily when many people congregate in one place
 logon kii bheed ke udhaaharan main fouj yaa schoolonmen ekatra hue log shaamil hai
 GAS can dry up and get dusty, but after this they cannot make people sick
 yadi vaataavaran main vishaanu nam rah jaayen to ve 15 dinon tak logon ko biimaar kar sakate hai
 Moisture-filled viruses can be found on items such as toothbrushes
 ye vishaanu khaadya padaarthon main jivit rah sakate hai, lekin yah kaaphi asaamaanya he
 People who eat these foods can fall ill
 strape throt ke lakshanon ko na darshane vaale 12 pratishat bacchon ke gale main jiees saamaanya taur par hote hai
 The checklist, named after the revised Centaur issue, helps doctors decide how to care for people with sore and sore throats
 The centaur digit consists of five diagnostic measurements or assessments
 ye darshaate hai ki is baat kii kitni sambhaavna he ki kisi ko strape throt kii samasya he
 All these parameters are given a score: ek pareekshan jise gale kaa culture kehete hai, yah jaanane kaa mukhya tarika he ki kya kisi vyakti ko strape throt he
 This test is correct 90 to 95 percent of the time
 ek or pareekshan he jo twarit strape pareekshan yaa arediti kehalaata he
 This quick strep test takes less time than throat culture but is only 70 percent accurate
 dono pareekshan yah bataa sakate hai ki kab ek vyakti strape throt se peedit nahin he
 Both these tests give it up to 98 percent correct
 kisi vyakti ke biimaar hone par gale kaa culture yaa twarit strape pareekshan yah bataa sakate hai ki kya vah vyakti strape throt se peedit he
 Throat culture or rapid strep testing should not be performed on people who do not have symptoms of the disease, because streptococcal virus in the throat of some people may, in general, be present without causing any problems and treatment to these people Is not required
 strape throt ke kuch lakshan duusare rogon ke samaan hote hai
 For this reason, it can be difficult to know if a person has a problem with strep throat without performing a throat culture or a quick strep test
 yadi kisi vyakti ko bukaar ho yaa usko karaash va dard vaale gale kii samasya ho jiske saath usko khaansee, bahatinak,dast, ankhonmen laalimaa ke saath khujali ho to is baat kii sambhaavna adhik he ki usevyrasadvara hone vaale gale ke dard kii samasya ho
 sankramak mononuclosis gale main lymph nodes main sujan tathaa sor throt, bukhaar utpann kar saktaa he tathaa galtundika kaa aakaar badha saktaa he
 This diagnosis can be determined by a blood test
 halanki sankramak mononuclosis ke liye koi vishisht upachaar nahin hota he
 Some people have more problems with strep throat than others
 galtundika ko hataanaa ek tarika he jisase ki in logon ko strape throt kii samasya na ho
 a strep throat three or four times a year can be a good reason for removing the tonsils
 pratiksha karnaa bhi upyukt he
 The strep throat usually lasts for a few days without treatment
 pratijaivik dwaara upachaar karne se lakshan 16 ghante pehle samaapt ho jaaenge
 The main reason for antibiotic treatment is to reduce the risk of serious illness
 udhaaharan ke liye ek dil kii beemaari jise amvaat bukhaar kehete hai yaa gale main mawaad kaa sangrah jise rateropherengial abses kehete hai
 If antibiotics are given within 9 days of the onset of symptoms, they work better
 strape throt ke kaaran hone vaale dard ko kam karne kii dawa kaaphi sahaayak ho sakati he
 These usually include nsaids or Paracetamol also known as acetaminophen
 steroid bhi upyogi hai, jis tarah se lidoken
 Aspirin can be used in adults
 bacchon ko aspirin dena thik nahin he kyonki iske kaaran unako reye syndromahone kii kaaphi sambhaavna hoti he
 Penicillin v is the most common antibiotic used for strep throat in the United States
 yah lokapriy he kyonki surakshit he, achche bhang se kaam karti he tathaa adhik mahangi bhi nahin he
 Amoxicillin is generally used in Europe
 bharat main is baat kii kaaphi sambhaavna he ki logon ko amvaat bukhaar kii samasya ho
 iske kaaran, sui se di jane vaali dawa jise benzathine penniciline ji kehete hai, ek aam upachaar he
 Reduces the average duration of antibiotic symptoms
 ausat avadhi teen se paanch din kii hoti he
 Antibiotics reduce this by one day
 ye dawaaen beemaari ke failaav ko bhi kam kar detii hai
 Medications are primarily used to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever, rash, or infection
 pratijaivik ke achche prabhaavon ko sambhavit dushprabhavon dwaara santulit kiya janaa chaiye
 Antibiotic treatment may not be suitable for healthy adults with adverse reactions to medications
 strape throt ke liye pratijaivik aksar ummid se adhik upyog kiye jate hai, tab bhi jabaki yah utana gambhir na ho yaa iske failane kii sambhaavna bhi kam ho
 The drug erythromycin should be used only on those who are allergic to penicillin
 Cephalosporin can be used on people who are less allergic
 stryptococal sankraman ke kaaran gurde main sujan ho sakati he 
 pratijaivik is sthiti kii sambhaavna ko kam nahin karti hai
 The symptoms of strep throat begin to improve in about three to five days, through or without drugs
 pratijaivik se upachaar ke madhyam se beemaari ke or kharaab hone kaa jokhim kam ho jaataa he
 They also make it difficult for the disease to spread
 bachche pehali pratijaivik khuraaq lene ke 24 ghante ke baad phir se skool janaa shuru kar sakate hai
 Due to strep throat, the following extremely bad problems can occur: strape throt ek aisi vistrut shrenee main shaamil he jisamen karaash va dard vaale gale kii samasya yaa feringitis shaamil hai
 Every year in the US, about 11 million people suffer from a sore and painful throat problem
 karaash va dard vaale gale kii samasya ke adhiktar maamle vishaanuon se paidaa hote hai
 Bacterial group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus causes 15 to 30 percent of sore and painful throat problems in children
 vayaskon main karaash va dard vaale gale kii samasya kaa 5 se 20 pratishat, isi kaaran se hota he
 These cases usually occur in the winter and early spring

 War between two opposing persons or parties, according to predetermined and well-known rules, is called duel by the prevailing weapons
 aise yuddh pracheen kaal main bahut se deshon main prachlit the
 At the core of their practice was the belief that in these wars, God wins only those in whose favor justice is done
 bharat main aise yuddh dharmayuddh samajhe jate the
 Duel battles were prevalent in the Vedic period
 uttar vaidic kaal main inke sambandh main nae niyam banaakar purvaprachlit pratha main sudhaar kiya gaya
 There are many references to duel in Ramayana and Mahabharata
 ram ravan, baali sugriv tathaa duryodhana or bhim ke yuddh iske udhaaharan hai
 In the later period also, these wars had a considerable trend
 kshatriyon ke bich jo baaten anya prakaar se nahin sulajhaai ja sakati thim unke nirnay ke liye yah reeti apanaai jaati thi
 It was often the case that when two kings stood face to face with an army for war, in order to save bloodshed it was decided that one of the opposing armies, or in equal numbers, would fight the crusade and The warriors of the side should be considered victorious

 According to the ancient pundits of Europe, the judgment of David and Goliath described in the Bible was divinely approved
 is aadhaar par dwandvayudhon kaa auchity madhyayug main sweekaar kiya jaataa tha
 The origin of the early duel in Europe from the earliest times is not well known, but the detailed methods edited at the beginning of this famous war by Menelius and Paris described in the Iliad are the etiquette practices and ancient practices of this relationship prevalent during the time of the Greek poet Homer
 The customs are revealed
 dwandvayuddh kii pratha kaa prachlan pracheen italy main ambria pradesh ke nivaasiyon tathaa slav jatiyon main bhi hone ke pramaan milte hai
 But it was not practiced in the state of Rome, but the Romans considered it the practice of uncivilized people
 parantu is kaal main bhi prasiddh roman senapati, sipio afracanas ne isa purv 203 main is spain main prachlit paaya tha
 It was also practiced among the ancient Germanic castes
 jin samrik paramparaon se europe main samantvaad tathaa shur veeron ke yug kaa vikaas hua unheen ke kaaran, roman samrajya ke patan ke pashchaat, dwandvayuddh ne bhi samast europe main san 814 se 840 tak samrajya sthapit karanevaale lui l debonaire ke rajya main yadi koi kisi par dosha lagaataa or prativaadee use asweekrut karata to nyaayadhish dwandvayuddh kii ajna detaa tha
 There is no doubt that at the core of the spirit of the duel was a personal reputation based on courage and a sense of honor
 yadi lalakaara hua vyakti yuddh karnaa sweekaar nahin karata tha to vah kaayar tathaa hin samajha jaataa tha
 In Europe until mid-16th century, the practice of justice from duel was generally legal
 simit kshetron main khadey hokar ye yuddh lade jate the tathaa nishchit vidhiyon or kade niyamon se bandhe hote the
 According to a popular law, the man who was challenged was the right to choose weapons
 ek anya niyamanusaar kisi prakaar ke jaadu tone kii, athwa mitron tathaa darshakon se kisi prakaar kii, sahaayta varjit thi
 Although the term duality is used in this type of war, even in India like Europe, there were sometimes many humans on each side of the war
 is prakaar ek yuddh san 1396 main scotland kii ke or chaten jatiyon main, raja robert tisare ke sammukh hua tha
 In this, 30 warriors from each side fought as long as only 10 humans survived on one side
 france main henry dwitiya ne san 1547 main, raja yaa nyaayadhikari ke sammukh honevaale nyaayik dwandvayuddh band kara die
 As a result of this, the practice of personal duel and fighting till death was followed
 aise yudhon main ladanevaalon ke saath do yaa adhik mitra bhi yah dekhne ke liye rahete the ki koi aniyamitata yaa anyaay na hone paae
 In 1578, a duel broke out between the beloved deity of the King of France, Kellus, and the duchess of the Geez at the Sier de Dunes
 isaki prishthbhumi raajnneetik hone ke kaaran donon ore se jo mitra nireekshak haakar aae the unamem bhi aapas main yuddh than gaya
 As a result, two of these friends lived in the fields
 ek kii mrityu baad main hui tathaa chauthaa gambhir rup se aahat hua
 The incident also gave rise to the practice of inspectors participating in the duel, which continued for nearly 75 years, across Europe
 16veen or 17veen shatiyon main europe ke adhikansh deshon main dwandvayuddh ke virodh main anek kanoon banaae gaye, kintu lalakaare jane par yuddh se mukh modana kaayarta samajha jaataa tha, samaaj main aise yudhon kaa bahu prachlan ho gaya tha tathaa kendriya rajshakti simit hoti thi
 For these reasons, they could not be stopped
 kintu san 1643 main lui 14wein ke france ke singhaasana par arudh hone par avasthaa badal gai, kyonki usne aise yudhon main bhaag lenevaalon ke liye mrityudand niyat kar diya tha
 This kind of war stopped basically, but they continued in another form
 dwandvayuddh ke icchhuk us samay prachlit choti talavaaron ko lekar bina kisi ko jataae, kisi sunsaan sthaan main akele bhid jate the or yadi inamen se koi maaraa jaataa to kanoon se bachane ke liye doosraa yah kahkar apni jaan bachaa letaa ki yah krity aatmaraksha main hua he
 But when the killings started under the guise of this custom, the duel in the deserted place stopped and the practice of the inspectors started again, but they themselves did not fight
 19veen shatee tak talavaaron se ladane kaa chalan tha
 Till then, it was necessary to strictly follow the rules in these wars and as soon as there was bloodshed in France, the war was stopped
 is prakaar in yudhon main vishesh haani kii sambhaavna nahin rah gai
 At this time and later, there was a trend of duel warfare among the students of Germany with a special type of sword, but it used the means of body defense, such as armor, etc
, and even if it was wound, it was usually subordinate
 in yudhon main pistolon kaa prayog 18veen shatee ke madhya se aarambh hua
 From the beginning, it was customary that a mounted opponent armed with a sword and a dagger, holding a loaded pistol in hand, pounced on each other and fired pistols at each other while passing by
 yadi donon yoddha jivit batch jate to lautakar ve talwaar or khanjar se yuddh karte the
 By the year 1780, it was well-known to fight duel with pistols by standing on the ground and special types of pistols were being made for this purpose

 The number of casualties in such wars is estimated from an article written in 1836, according to the author, in which more than two hundred registered duel of pistols, one out of every six humans was injured and one out of every 13 humans died on
 is prakaar ke yudhon ke dushprayog tathaa dushprinaam samajhadaar logon ke sanmukh dirghakaal se spasht ho rahe the
 In various countries of Europe, a rule was made to stop them, to remove the criminals of the duel
 iskaa prabhaav yah hua ki englad ke sainik tathaa asainik donon prakaar ke nagarikon main iskaa chalan band ho gaya
 In 1850, this practice arose from almost all other countries

 This water is evaporated and salt is readily obtained
 samudr ke jal main namak prachur maatra main vidyaman he
 Prior to 1947, the main source of salt in India was salts
 khaybar main namak kii vishaal khaane hai
 The thickness of the salt fold here is more than 100 feet
 yah namak itnaa adhik varnheen evam paardarshak he ki yadi namak kii 10 foot moti diwaal ke ek ore prakashpunj rakhaa jaae to duusari ore koi bhi vyakti saralata se pard saktaa he
 This salt deposit has been mining for a long time

 One such place is Vachhi and the other is Khohar
 yahan par namak ke atirikt potacium chloride bhi kuch anshon main vidyaman he
 After partition, this part has moved to Pakistan
 is samay bharat kaa shailya namak sraat keval himachal pradesh ke mandi jile main sthit namak kii khaane hai
 Here, the work of digging salt in two places Gunma and Dhrang has been going on for a long time
 sadak ke kinare-kinare joginder nagar se mandi tak anek sthanon par lavan jal ke jharne hai
 a deposit of salt in Gunma is more than 150 feet thick, but this salt contains up to 10-15 percent silica in the form of sand
 at: yah namak purna rup se manushya ke khaane ke yogya nahin he
 For a long time this salt has been used to feed animals
 gunma main lavan nikshepon se ek purnat; shuddh evam shwet prakaar kaa namak utpann karne kii yojana bharat sarkaar bana rahi he
 Dhrang also has many huge springs of saline water, where a high degree of salt can be obtained by evaporating the salt solution
 bharat main namak kaa dwitiya strot rajasthan he
 There is a large area of about 90 square miles which is a trough near Sambhar
 is gart ke nikatavarti kshetron kaa jal ekatra ho jaataa he or is prakaar namakeen jal kii ek jhil ban jaati he
 Probably the reason for this is the presence of salt in the soil of nearby areas
 yah lavan jal kyaariyon main ekatra kiya jaataa he
 Here it is evaporated by incense, as the area receives intense sunlight
 november ke maheene main ye kyaariyaan lavanjal se bhari jaati hai tathaa april, may tak avakshipt namak ko ekatra kar liya jaataa he or jo bitern shesh rahata he use jhil ke ek bhaag main sanchit kar diya jaataa he
 The salt obtained in this way is good
 namak kaa utpaadan is kshetra main paryaapt hota he
 The origin of this salt has not been clarified yet
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki yah vayujanit namak he jo samudr se vaayu ke saath aata he or varsha ke saath rajasthan main gir jaataa he tathaa is vishaal jhil main sanchit ho jaataa he
 Bittern was not considered to have any value for a long time, but the author has researched and found that this bittern contains about 62 percent common salts, 25 percent sodium sulfate and 8 percent sedi carbonate
 is kshetra main sodium sulphate tathaa sodium chloride ke lavenon kaa vipul maatra main sangrah ha saktaa he
 Separation of sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate from salt may be possible by suitable means
 sambhars jhil kshetra main ek lambey samay se khanankaarya kiya ja rahaa he, kintu abhi tak namak ke utpaadan tathaa maatra main koi hraas nahin hua he
 Therefore, this lake can be considered as an everlasting source of salt
 iske atirikt rajasthan main namak ke do anya strot vidyaman hai, pratham digaanaa jhil tathaa duusari didvanaa jhil
 These lakes are also of the same type as Sambhar
 inamen se ek main sodium sulphate ke brihat nikshep praapt hue hai
 The precipitation of pure sodium sulfate is separated from the lake water
 kuch varshon tak yah jhil sodium sulphate kaa sasta strot rahi he
 The third source of salt is saltwater from the sea

 This work is started after the monsoon and is finished before the monsoon arrives
 baroda se bombai janevaali railway line par donon ore namak ke bade-bade dher dikhaai padate hai
 The bitterness that remains after making salts from seawater contains a large amount of magnesium chloride
 lavan ke kuch kaarkaane kharaghoda main is aashay se sthapit kiye gaye hai ki is bitern se magnesium chloride praapt kiya jaae jo vipul maatra main sugamawa se mil saktaa he
 Salt is produced in large quantities from this source and production can be greatly increased
 kathiyawad main dhrangadhra, porbandar tathaa dwarka ke sameep kshar ke kaarkaane prarambh ho chuke hai jo solvay kii vidhi dwaara sodium carbonate kaa vaanijya str par utpaadan karte hai
 Chilka Lake is also a lake of saline water which belongs to the sea
 yahan bhi brihat str par namak ke utpaadan kaa praytn kiya ja rahaa he
 Bengal also produces sufficient amount of salt and efforts are also being made to increase production here, but a major difficulty in making salt here is that the salt content in the Bay of Bengal waters due to the fall of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers here
 Decreases enough
 in sroton ke atirikt kuch kshetra aise hai jahaan par sthaliy jal atyant namakeen hota he
 In ancient times, salt was prepared by evaporating this water
 rajasthan main bharatpur ke sameep ek aisa kshetra he jahaan kuon kaa jal nitant lavniya he
 It is drawn by leather men from leathers and evaporates to make salt
 vaanijya str par is strot se namak praapt karne kii yojanaon ke vikaas kaa purna praytn kiya ja rahaa he
 There are also some small sources from which salt is obtained, for example, Lunar Lake in Buldana district of Bombay
 yah 400 foot gahari he
 In the rainy season, water gets collected and after the end of the rains, after evaporation, this lake also produces sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate in addition to salt
 abhi haal main hi himachal pradesh main ghrag naamak kshetra main namak ke bade vishaal strot mili hai jo bahut lambey samay tak namak kaa utpaadan karte rahenge
 In addition to food, salt is used in large quantities in the manufacture of burning soda, chlorine and sodium metal and other industries
 aaj duniya main namak kii dainik khuraaq 9-12 gram prativyakti he, jabaki vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke suzav ke anusaar ye ek chaay ke chammach yani, 5-6 gram hona chahie
 Recent evidence suggests that its diet should be only 2-3 grams per day

 All other technical personnel below were appointed at the local level
 chunki ye log anpadh the, inaki kaaryakshmata bahut kam thi
 Therefore, to impart knowledge of writing, reading, geography and mechanics in this area, industrial training schools were opened near the Ordnance Factory
 san 1825 se pehle kalakatta va mumbai main is prakaar ke skool the
 But the evidence available for this is the Industrial Training School opened at Gundi, Madras
 jo aayudh factrury ke sameep tha
 Similarly, in 1854, a school was opened in Poona for training of engineers
 america va europe main takneekee mahavidhyalayon kaa vikaas ho rahaa tha, jo ganit main vishesh prashikshan de rahe the
 In India too, there was a demand that schools of this type of technology should be opened in colonial India too

 Despite the economic difficulties in India, it is clear that technology has gradually entered the economic and production sectors and its use is constantly increasing
 shiksha ke kshetra main bhi is kaa vaanchit he tathaa shiksha main takneekee kaa prayog hone laga he va is disha main anusandhan bhi hone lage hai
 The two major areas of education are learning and teaching
 in donon prakriyaaon ke madhyam se adhigamakarta apane uddeshyon ko nirantar punarbalan nahin de saktaa he jo ek adarsh adhigam str ke liye aavashyak he or isliye shikshan ko mashin evam anya shikshan sahaayak saamagree kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Before 1960, 'educational technology' was related to audio-visual material and most of the teaching material related to classroom teaching
 adhiktar shikshakon evam shikshak-prashikshakon ke liye shaikshik takneekee kaa arth shikshan main prayukt sahaayak saamagree se hi hota tha
 Educational toys etc
 were also used in primary classes in the early nineteenth century

 Through this, he can increase his knowledge to the latest extent
 shikshan takneekee evam vyavhaar takneekee main anek shikshan mashiinon-hardware evam software kaa prayog kiya jane laga he
 The present era is called the technological age
 jaise-jaise shiksha ke kshetra main pragati hoti gai, shiksha ko adhikadhik vai gyanik aadhaar dene kii aavashyaktaa anubhav hone lagi kyonki prayek takneekee vikaas ke aadhaar shiksha hi he
 The concept of education is primarily the all-round development of the child as the most modern concept

 Comets with short paths complete the orbit of the Sun in an elliptical path in about 6 to 200 years

 Comets with long paths take thousands of years to orbit one

 As the comet approaches the Sun, the tail size increases
 dhoomaketu ke bhautik gun neeche sarini main diya gaya he - The comet is classified on the basis of its orbit
 The orbits of comets with short orbits are smaller than 200 years, while the orbits of long-sighted comets are under the Sun's gravity, despite being very long
 Due to the solo orbiting orbit of parabola, such comets once circled the sun and went out of the solar system forever
 The orbit of the Anke Comet with smaller orbit lies between the Sun and the Guru
 It is believed that smokers with short orbit originate in the Kuiper belt, while long-haul axes originate in the Oort cloud
 It is believed that comets hold a long orbit when the Sun passes near a star orbiting the galaxy, or when the Sun's possible companion star, Nemesis or Planet X, comes close to it

 Sometimes it happens that after thorough study of the newly discovered comets, they are identified as missing comets
 11P / Temple - Swift - Linear Comet is an example of this
 He was first seen in 1869, after 1908 Jupiter's influence changed its orbit and it disappeared somewhere in space

 However, Intel revealed on 15 October 2007 that it was developing another new mobile processor for olpc-type devices, codenamed Diamondvil
 "etom " vah naam tha, jiske antargat silverthorn ko bechaa janaa tha, jabaki purv main menlo ke rup main kodenamit kiye gayi samarthak chipset ko centrino etom naam diya gaya
 Intel's initial Atom press release only briefly discussed "diamondville" and provided that it would be named "atom", which led to Diamondmondville's lowering of Silverthorne with slightly higher tdps at slightly lower clock speeds The cost-only, higher-flexibility version is just that
 2008 main shanghai main hue spring intel develper forum main, intel ne aupchaarik rup se ghoshnaa kii ki silverthorn or diamandwil ek samaan microsanrachana par aadhaarit hai
 Silverthorne will be called the Atom z series and Diamondville the Atom n series
 The more expensive low-power Silverthorn parts will be used in Intel mobile Internet devices, while Diamondville will be used in low-cost desktops and notebooks

9 GFLOPS
 pinavue placeform pichley diamandwil placeform kii tulana main bahut adhik tej sabit nahin hua he
 The reason for this is that the Pineview platform also uses the same Bonnel implementation core as Diamondwill and is still connected to the memory controller via FSB
 iske kaaran cpu-saghan anuprayogon main memory vilambtaa or pradarshan main bahut kam hi sudhaar hota he
 The Atom x86 instruction executes the set; x86-64 has so far only been enabled for Desktop Diamondville and Desktop and Mobile Pineview Core
