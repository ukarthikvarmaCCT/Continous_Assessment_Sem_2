 Royal College of Midwives' deputy secretary-general Louise Silvertone says that not only has tolerance for suffering and disease "significantly reduced" in society, but women also fear fear of suffering and think that if a caesarean If taken, the pain will be less
 Silvertone and the Royal College of Midwives believe - "women have lost confidence in their ability to give birth
" " Silvertone's analysis is controversial among some surgeons

 It is believed that after the arrival of successful cesarean births in the last 150 years, the mothers of small pelvic and overweight children at birth survived and the population increased due to these reasons
 Such a concept is based on the idea that the c-section rate will continue to rise further due to the slow growth in the gene structure of the population without fear of misconduct, obesity of the mother and suffering from diabetes, and without other comprehensive factors

 For this reason, if a caesarean is found to be correct for a woman, it should be selectively performed during the daytime surgery period, rather than waiting for an emergency to occur, leading to emergency surgery
 The reason is increased surgical and anesthetic problems

 Obstetricians and other caregivers have different opinions about the comparative benefits of vaginal and caesarean section; Some consider it normal, some believe it not
 aadhunik prasav dekhbhaal main jis cheez par jor daalaa janaa chahie, vah yah he ki nirnay, prasav-visheshgy tathaa maa / janm dene vaale saathi ke bich kaa hona chahie, har prakaar ke janan ke khataron tathaa laabhon ke moolyankan ke baad liya janaa chahie

 In the United States, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology reformed the guidelines for vaginal births that occurred after pre-caesarean births in 1999 and again in 2004
 These improvements to the guidelines include the following recommendations: kyonki garbhashayi vidar vinaashkari ho saktaa he, VBAC kaa prayaas aise santhaan main kiya janaa chahie jo apaat-seva ke liye uplabdh twarit chikitsakon ke saath apatakaalin sthitiyon se nipatane ke liye sakasham hon
 In some cases this recommendation had a major impact on the vbacs available to mothers giving birth in the US
 For example, a study published in 2006, based on a change in the frequency of VBAC generation in California after this change in guidelines, found that the VBAC rate fell to 13
5%, which was 24 before this change
 % Was located at VBAC

 But if you ever go to Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, the 'van Vihar' National Park in the middle of the city will seem to prove all these things wrong
 yah 'thri in van' rashtriya udyaan he
 This unique park is a national park as well as a zoo and wild animal rescue center
 445 hectare kshetra main faile is rashtriya udyaan main milane vaale jaanwaron ko jangal se pakadakar nahin laayaa gaya he
 Most of the animals here are unclaimed, weak, sick, injured or old or wandering from the forests and came to rural-urban areas and later they were captured and brought here
 kuch jaanavar duusare praani sangrahalayon se bhi yahan laae gaye hai jabaki kuch sarkason se chhudaakar yahan rakhe gaye hai
 Van Vihar is amazing
 paanch kilometre lambey is rashtriya udyaan ke ek taraf puraa pahaad or harabhra maidani kshetra he jo jangalon tathaa hariyaali se aachhadit he

 But both these zoos fall under the category of 'small zoo' or small zoos and are maintained by the local municipal corporation
 ye donon hi chidyaghar kisi bhi maamle main van vihaar ke aas-paas nahin thaharte
 It is due to the magnificent features of Van Vihar that it was given the status of National Park on 18 January 1983, which is an achievement in itself
 WD wdvana vihaar ke andar ghusane se pehle lagata hi nahin he ki aap ek khubasurat jangal main pravesh karne vaale hai

 Originally, de Boisbaudran determined the density of gallium as 4

 Muslim children raised the laugh of Durga Maa
 hakeekat ne kaha ki yadi main tumhaari bibi fatima ke bare main kuch kahuun, to tumhen kaisaa lagegaa? What was it then, as soon as Mulla ji came, those mischievous students complained that he abused Bibi Fatima
 phir to baat badhate hue kaaji tak ja pahunchi
 The same decision was expected during the Muslim rule

 Reality did not accept this
 parinamat: use talwaar ke ghat utaarne kaa farmaan jari ho gaya
 It is said that on seeing his innocent face, the sword fell from the executioner's hand
 hakeekat ne talwaar uske haath main di or kaha ki jab main baccha hokar apane dharm kaa paalan kar rahaa hum, to tum bade hokar apane dharm se kyon vimukh ho rahe ho? is par jallaad ne dil majboot kar talwaar chalaa di, par us vir kaa sheesh dharti par nahin gira

 Oil leakage is the release of liquid petroleum hydrocarbons into the environment due to human activities and is a type of pollution
 is shabd kaa upyog aksar samudri tel risaav ke liye kiya jaataa he, jahaan tel samudr main athwa tateey jal main mukt hota he
 Oil spills include leakage of crude oil from tankers, offshore platforms, excavation equipment and wells, as well as leakage of refined petroleum products and their by-products and heavy fuels such as bunker fuel used in large vessels or any Leakage of oily residual or waste oil is included

 Natural oil spills also cause oil to enter the marine environment

 Oil penetrates the structure of birds' feathers, reducing their immunity, thus birds become more sensitive to changes in temperature and their buoyancy in water is also reduced

 When birds scratch their veins with beaks, the oil applied to the feathers is swallowed, due to which their kidneys are spoiled, liver functions are changed and the digestive system is irritated

 Birds exposed to petroleum may have altered hormone balance, including changes in luteinizing proteins

 Cleaning and restoring oil spills is difficult and depends on factors such as the type of oil leaked, the temperature of the water and the varieties of coastlines and beaches

 Coastline types are classified into categories based on how the garret will be cleaned, how long the oil will remain and how sensitive the shoreline is
 tel kii tairti chiknayee kii parat jab antat kinare par aakar adhbstar ko tel se dhak detii he, tab tatarekha vishesh rup se khatre mon aa jaati he
 Between different varieties of shorelines, different subsets have different responses to oiliness and they influence the type of cleaning required to effectively purify the shoreline

 There is a tendency to assign high ESI grades to airshifts and swamps due to the potential long-term and harmful effects of both oil contamination and cleaning operations

 Plant and animal populations at risk of oil spills are referred to as "elements" and are divided into functional groups
 prayek tatv kaa aage vargeekaran use samaan jivan vritton tathaa tel risaav se sambandhit vyavhaaron vaale prajati samoohon main vibhajit karata he
 Element groups are eight: birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, populations and plants, wetlands and marine mammals and terrestrial mammals
 Element groups are further subdivided into subgroups, for example, the 'marine mammal' element group divided into dolphins, manatees, pinnipeds, polar bears, sea auters and whales

 The classification of human use resources has been mainly divided into four parts; Archaeological significance or cultural resource sites, high-use recreational areas or shoreline access points, important protected management areas or resource sources
 Some examples include airports, diving sites, popular beach sites, ports, natural protected areas or marine sanctuaries
 pani kii sataha par tel kii parat kii motaai tathaa pani kii sataha par uske rup ko dekh kar risaav kii maatra kaa anumaan lagaana sambhav he
 If the surface area of the leakage is also known, then the total amount of leakage oil can also be calculated

 Adequate description of the wind and current field is very important for the skill of oil leakage model prediction
 ek vishwavyaapee tel risaav modelling ) kaarykram maujuud he
 Exploring the scope of an oil leak also involves confirming that the hydrocarbon collected during the ongoing oil leak is derived from an active leak or from another source
 Sophisticated analytical chemistry focused on the characteristics of the oil source can be obtained based on the complex mixture of substances present
 mote taur par, ye anek hydrocarbon honge jinamein se sarvaadhik upyogi poliaromatic hydrocarbon hai
 In addition, both hydrocyclic hydrocarbons of oxygen and nitrogen, such as the parent of carboxyl and alkyl homologs, quinoline and pyridine, are available in many crude oils
