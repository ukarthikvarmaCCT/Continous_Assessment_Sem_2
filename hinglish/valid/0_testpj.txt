 a group of writers, who proved to have epoch-making effects after World War II with their different attitudes to American society and culture, and the style of writing, was called the 'beat Generation' and the literature composed by them was called Beat Literature
 Also known as 1950-60 i0 ke aas-paas is peedi kaa adhiktam sahitya prakashit hua va jan-saamaanya main prachlit hua
 The main focus of his writing was the rejection of prevailing social beliefs, spiritual search, the inability of materialism, the study of American and Eastern religions, and the sexual relations and the freedom of drug abuse

 Jack Keruac wrote the phrase "beat Generation" in 1948 to mark an alleged underground, anti-homicide youth movement in New York
 Introduced

 Keruac allows this original form to have street hustler Herbert Hunkel who used the phrase "beat", as in an earlier discussion with him

 The origins of the Beat Generation unearthed Columbia University and may be the meeting of Keruac, Ginsburg, Lucian Carr, Hal Chase and others

 He said he was given the option of advocating insanity to avoid a prison sentence, and he met Carl Solomon where he was committed to 90 days at Bellevue Hospital

 In his first public reading, Ginsburg performed the just-finished first part of the howl

 Since the 1956 publication of "howl", it was also a marker of the beginning of the Beat movement and in 1957 brought its obscenity test to nationwide attention
 chah gailaree padhane kerua ke 1958 upanyaas jiskaa mukhya nayak "jaaphy rider," vastav main gairi snidar par aadhaarit he, jo ek charitra "dharma bams", ke duusare adhyay bataate hai
 Keruac was impressed with Snyder and they were close for a number of years
 1955 ke vasant main ve snidar ke mil vaili cabin main ek saath rahete the
 Most beats were urban and they found Snyder almost foreign, with his rural background and wilderness experience, as well as his education in cultural anthropology and Oriental languages

 Carr also met with Burroughs in 1944, through which he knew Keruac's girlfriend Eddie Parker

 He later claimed by self-defense whether he killed Kammare with a Boy Scout knife in Riverside Park, then waited, then after consulting, threw the body into the Hudson River to turn himself into what Burroz suggested

 One of his last, Dulo's arrogance, once again wrote about the incident twice in his first novel, Town and City, and Keruac in his own works
 unhone kaha, baroj ke saath ek sahyog upanyaas likhaa tha "and da hippos var boild in der tenks" hatya ke vishay main
 Gary Snyder was an important member of the Hara movement
 gairi snidar vyapak rup se lekhakon kii beet peedi sarkal ke ek sadsy ke rup main mana jaataa he: vah prasiddh chah gailaree ghatana main padhaa ki kaviyon main se ek tha, or kerua sabase lokapriy upanyaason, "dharma bams" main se ek ke bare main likhaa gaya tha
 Some critics argue that Snyder's connection with Beats is exaggerated and that he can be better regarded as a member of the West Coast group San Francisco Renaissance, which is independently developed

 Edgar Allan Poe conceded occasionally, and Ginsburg claimed an impact on the Emily Dickinson Beat poem

 Surrealism was in many ways still an important movement in the 1950s

 His focal point in his review, "beats Generation
" The "primitive social practices" were blinding and directionless disappearance
 unka maananaa tha ki is prakaar kii aniojit sahajata, hinsa va bauddhik atarksangata ko janm de sakati he
 His reasoning was that this ideology of Beats promotes criminal practices in the society
 beats ke sadasyon par lagaae gaye aaropon main se ek tha ki, ve "jivan" va "sahitya" ke bich ke antar ko samaapt karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 In response to this, Ginsberg said in a 1958 documentary "the Village Vice", "we are being accused of a hollow allegation of intellectual disharmony
" hamane bhi in tikaakaron kii bhanti unhi shaalaaon main vidya pai jaha buddha jivi bhi hote the
 Podhoretz is also rooted in the literature of eighteenth century in the twentieth century, so his outlook is backward

 These principles include padosopan, unity of command, area of control, leadership, supervision, delegation, coordination, power and accountability etc
 'padanukram', angreji shabd hyrarki kaa hindikaran he
 'hirarki' means an arrangement of power or position from lowest to highest
 yah siddhanth sarvyaapee he
 Without Padasopan, no administrative organization can be imagined
 adhikansh sanghathan piramid aakaar ke hote hai
 The functions and responsibilities in the organization are divided between the unit and the sub-unit
 yah vibhaajan kshaitij tathaa lamb rup donon hi prakaar se kiya jaataa he
 As a result of long division, the levels of top management, middle level management, inspectors and specific functions are formed
 padsopan ke anusaar sopan sanghathan main nimnatam pad se sarvocch pad tak sopan ke anusaar padon kaa kram hota he
 The decision process in the organization goes through these positions or levels
 jis samay sanghathan kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he, us samay vibhinn staron ke sambandh main sanghathan nirmaataaon ke mastishk main ucchata yaa nimnata kaa koi vichaar nahin hota he
 But the relationship between high and low or subordinates in organization behavior develops due to the difference in pay scales of different posts, the nature of responsibilities at different levels and the qualifications of personnel working at different administrative levels
 hyrarki kaa shabdic arth hota he nimnatar par ucchtar kaa shashan yaa niyantran
 In practice, the term refers to an organization that is organized in a successive sequence of steps, like a ladder or step, just as the ladder is placed one after the other, corresponding to one in the step ladder
 There is another post
 is padakram main prayek nichalaa pad yaa str apane se nikatatam ucch pad ke tathaa us pad ke madhyam se usase bhi upar ke pad tathaa usee prakaar sabase upar ke pad athwa padon ke aadhin hota he
 It is a valid principle of Padasopan that the higher officer cannot ignore the intermediary officer while making contact at the lower level
 thik usee prakaar koi bhi nimna padaadhikari ucch adhikari se sampark sthapit karte samay madhyasth adhikari kii avhelnaa nahin kar saktaa
 Leaping any pole while climbing or descending a ladder is not free from danger
 thik usee prakaar prashasan main kisi str ko langhna bhi sanghathan main prashasnic pareshaani utpann kar saktaa he
 All personnel in the organization are always expected to work through proper channels
 sanghathan main jab bhi koi patr vyavhaar yaa file chalati he, to upar kii ore yaa neeche kii ore jate samay prayek str par hote hue guzarati he
 This gradual process of Padasopan is also called 'proper medium'
 pad sopan ek aisi vyavastha he jisaki sahaayta se kisi sanghathan ke vibhinn vyaktiyon ke kaaryon ko ek duusare se joda jaataa he
 The higher officer in the organization orders his nearest subordinate officer or employee, the subordinate officer follows the orders of the higher officer
 nimna adhikari apane nikatatam adhikari ko aadesh desakata he
 Relationships between senior and subordinates are automatically established in the formation of organizations through multiple levels of responsibilities
 sanghathan main in ucch tathaa adhinsthon ke sambandhon kaa pyramidnuma dhaancha viksit ho jaataa he
 Moon and Rally have named Pad Sopan as step ladder process or step ladder theory
 moonay tathaa raily kaa kahana he ki jahaan kahin bhi varisht or adhinsth ke sambandhon se bana logon kaa sanghathan hoga, vahiin seedhinuma siddhanth bhi lagu hoga
 According to Moon, this principle is found in all organizations
 padsopan ko paribhaashit kartehue el 
 di
 hwite kehete hai – pad sopan upar se neeche tak uttardayitvon ke kai staron ke kaaran utpann varisht adhinsth kaa vah sambandh he, jo sabhi jagah lagu hota he
 According to Earl Latham, the stair step is such a planned system of high and low stanzas, which extends from top to bottom
 is vyavastha main sarvocch adhikari apanepad par virajman rahete hue paini drushti se sabase nimnatam pad dharak karmiyon ke dilo ko tatol sakate hai tathaa unki gatividhiyon ko apane aadeshaanusaar jaisaa chaahe dhaal saktaa he
 In this way, all the units are combined and made into one big unit to guide and control the activities of the organization in the step ladder
 je
 di milate ke anusaar pad sopan ek aisi paddati he jisamen vibhinn vyaktiyon ke prayaason ko aapas main jod diya jaataa he
 Moon and Rally have named the Padasopan system as the principle of the staircase process, and Hai Fayol has called it a cognitive chain
 unke anusaar jahaan kahin bhi ucch tathaa adhinsthon ke sambandhon se bana sanghathan hoga, vahiin par yah seedhinuma prakriya bhi avashya hogi
 In any organization, tasks and responsibilities are distributed in both vertical and vertical directions
 sanghathan main urdhvadhar vibhaajan main sheersh pad, madhyam pad tathaa nimna padon kii sthiti hoti he
 When new positions and levels are added to the formation, it increases vertically, whereas in the horizontal division, new new functions or positions are added without increasing the levels of foot steps
