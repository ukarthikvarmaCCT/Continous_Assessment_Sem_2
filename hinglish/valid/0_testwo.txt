 Homeopathy is a medical practice
 homeopathy chikitsa vigyaan ke janmdata dow chrishchiyan friderick samul hanemaan he
 It is based on the 'principle of symmetry' of medicine according to which medicines can cure diseases similar to those they can cause
 aushadhi kii rogahar shakti jisase utpann ho sakane vaale lakshanon par nirbhar he
 Those who like the symptoms of the disease but should prevail
 at: rog atyant nishchaypurvak, jad se, avilamb or sadaa ke liye nasht or samaapt usee aushadhi se ho saktaa he jo maanav sharir main, rog ke lakshanon se prabal or lakshanon se atyant milte julate sabhi lakshan utpann kar sake
 In the homeopathy method, the main task of the doctor is to listen to the life-history and symptoms mentioned by the patient and choose the medicine that produces the same symptoms
 rog lakshan evam aushadhi lakshan main jitani hi adhik samanta hogi rogi ke swasth hone kii sambhaavna bhi utani hi adhik rahati he
 The physician's experience is his greatest assistant
 puraane or kathin rog kii chikitsa ke liye rogi or chikitsak donon ke liye dhairya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Some homeopathy medical system proponents believe that the cause of the disease is the increase of atrophy in the body
 homeopathy chikitsakon kii dharna he ki prayek jivit praani hamen indriyon ke kriyasheel adarsh ko banaae rakhane kii pravriti hoti he aure jab yah kriyasheel adarsh vikrut hota he, tab praani main is adarsh ko praapt karne ke liye anek pratikriyaayein hoti hai
 The creature is only assisted in its efforts by medicine
 aushadhi alp maatra main deni chahie, kyonki beemaari main rogi atisanvegi hota he
 a small amount of the drug is effective, so that only one effect appears and there are no side effects
 rugnavastha main utakon kii roopantarit sangraahakta ke kaaran yah ekavastha prabhaav swasthya ke pun: sthaapan main viniyamit ho jaataa he
 Scholars consider homeopathy as pseudoscience
 da haniman dwaara pravartit homeopathy kaa mul siddhant he - "similia simivibas curenter" arthath rog unheen aushadhiyon se niraapad rup se, shighratisheeghra or atyant prabhaavshaalee rup se nirog hote hai, jo rogi ke rogalakshanon se milte-julate lakshan utpann karne main sakasham hai
 In other words, according to this rule, the small amount of the same drug, which creates a disorder in a healthy body, also destroys the natural symptoms of such symptoms
 udhaaharan ke liye kachche pyaaj kaatane par zukam ke jo lakshan ubharate hai jaise naak, aankh se pani nikalnaa usee prakaar ke zukam ke sthiti main homeopathic aushadhi alium sipa dene se thik bhi ho jaataa he
 In homeopathy, patients are instructed to give only one medicine at a time
 hanemaan ne anubhav ke aadhaar par ek baar main keval ek aushadhi kaa vidhaan nishchit kiya tha, kintu ab is mat main bhi paryaapt parivartan ho gaya he
 Some of the modern practitioners are following the path suggested by Hanaman and some have decided their own path and use two, three medicines at a time
 sadrush vigyaan ke aadhaar par rogi kii chayan kii gai aushadhi kii maatra ati nayun honi chaiye taaki dawa ke dushprinaam na dikhen
 Firstly, it acts as a component in the success of the body's resistance
 homeopathic aushadhi ko vishesh rup se taiyaar kiya jaataa he jise aushadhi shaktikaran kaa naam diya jaataa he
 These substances are prepared from trituration and liquids with suction system
 yah ek mul prasang he
 It is also true that homeopathy does not cure in the name of diseases
 vastav main yah rog se grasit vyakti ke maansik, bhavatmak tathaa shaareerik aadi sabhi pahaluhein kii chikitsa karti he
 Homeopathy of five asthma patients cannot be treated with a single medicine
 sampurna lakshan ke aadhaar par yah paanch rogiyon main alag-2 aushadhiyaan nirdhaarit kii ja sakati hai
 Hahnemann recognized the biographical power in the human body, and proclaimed that this biographical power protects the body from external invasive diseases
 parantu rogki avasthaa main yah jeevani shakti rog grasit ho jaati he
 The medicine selected on the basis of similar science, destroys this biotic power disorder and frees the body from disease
 haniman ne paaya ki sabhi puraane rogon ke aadharbhoot kaaran sora, psychosis or siphilis hai
 Hahnemann gave them the word Miyaz which means Greek - to pollute
 aushadhi ko chikitsa hetu upyog karne ke liye unki therapuyitak kshamta kaa gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Drug certification is a process in homeopathy in which the basic characteristics of the medicine are used to know the medicine by using it in healthy humans
 in aushadhiyon kaa pramann swasth manushyon par kiya jaataa he or inase hone vaale lakshanein kii jaankaree ke aadhaar par sadrushta vigyaan kii madad se rogon kaa ilaaj kiya jaataa he
 The important aspect of this medical practice is the potency
 prarambh main hanemaan ucch samarthy kii aushadhi prayukt karte the, kintu anubhav se inhone nimnasamarthy kii aushadhi kaa prayog bhi prabhavakaari paaya
 They found that many times, where physical changes or external factors are present in the disease, the drug of low strength works better
 homeopathic aushadhiyon main teen prakaar ke scale prayog kiye jate hai - In this, the process of triturate or succussion is done by mixing one part of the medicine in nine parts of the vehicle
 inase banane vaali aushadhi kii scale ko "x" shabd se janaa jaataa he jaise kaali faas 6x, aconite 3x ityadi
 Mostly, this scale used in solid drugs takes one part of medicine and 9 parts of milk-sugar to make 1x, liquid medicines use one part root and 9 parts alcohol to make 1x
 isse aage 2x ke liye 1x kaa ek bhaag or 9 bhaag dugdh sharkara athwa alcohol kaa lete hai ; aise hi aage kai potency banane ke liye pichhali potency kaa ek bhaag lete huye aage kii power ko badhaate hai
 In this, one part of the medicine is sacrificed with 99 parts of the vehicle
 inaki inase banane vaali aushadhiyon ko dawa kii shakti "c" se janaa jaataa he
 Such as 30c, 200c, 1000c etc
 sakkashan sirf dawa ke mul arq ko alcohol main milaanaa bhar nahin he balki use sakkashan karnaa he
 Nowadays automatic machine is used for succession, whereas in olden times it was to be made by hand by itself
 pehali potency banane ke liye dawa ke mul arq kaa ek hissaa or 99 bhaag alcohol liya jaataa he, isko 10 baar sacshan kar ke pehali potency taiyaar hoti he ; isi tarah duusari potency ke liye pichhali potency kaa ek bhaag or 99 bhaag alcohol ; isi tarah aage kii potency taiyaar kii jaati hai
 One of the main reasons for opposition to homeopathy is the low quantity of homeopathic medicines
 homeopathy davaayen arq, sampeshan tathaa tanutaaon ke rup main hoti he or kuch ether yaa glisreen main dhuli hoti hai, jaise sarpavish
 The extracts are mainly derived from the animal and vegetable world
 inhen vishisht ras, mul arq yaa matics tinchar kehete hai or inkaa pratik greek akshar 'theta' he
 The methods for preparing different strengths from matrix tinctures and transmissions are the same
 tanutaaon main bhinn-bhinn samarthy kii aushadhiyaan taiyaar kii jaati hai
 After starting from Moolark, as we move up in the scale of Tanuta, as we move away from the raw material, this is why the medicines made by the homeopathy method are generally toxic and harmless
 in aushadhiyon main ascharyajanak prabhaavshaalee aushadhiy gun hota he
 They are strong in disease and inactive towards body formation
 gandhak, paara, sankhiya, jasta, tin, barita, sona, chaandi, loha, chuunaa, tanba, tathaa telurium ityadi tatwon tathaa anya bahut se padaarthon se aushadhiyaan banaai gai hai
 Drugs are also made from the compounds of the elements
 homeopathy aushadhvivarani main 260 se 270 tak aushadhiyon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Most of these have been tested on healthy males, females or children to determine their pathogenic properties
 shesh dawaaon ko vivarani main anubhavsiddh hone ke naate sthaan diya gaya he
 1993 - 2002 - First 2003 - Second 2003 - Third 2003 - Fourth 2003 - 2006 - 2008 1993mumbai bamkand ek shreneegat 13 dhamaakon kaa kand tha, jo bombai main 12 march, 1993 ko hua tha
 Domestic violence is the term used to describe the beating or mistreatment of one partner at the domestic level after bonding, such as cohabitation or marriage
 antarang saathi athwa jivan saathi ke saath durvyavhaar bhi gharelu hinsa kii shrenee main aata he
 Domestic violence can also occur in opposite sex or homosexual relationships
 gharelu hinsa ke shaareerik, bhaavnaatmak, maukhik, aarthik or yon shoshan sahit vibhinn rup ho sakate hai, jisamen dhoortta se lekar vivaah pashchaat balaat yon sambandh or hinsak shaareerik shoshan bhi shaamil hai evam iske parinamswaroop maansik athwa shaareerik virupan athwa maut bhi sambhav he
 Globally, a wife or a female partner is more likely to be a victim of domestic violence, although the victim may be a victim of domestic violence against the other partner or both, or may also be a victim of domestic violence due to guilty self-defense or retaliation
 jabaki viksit vishwa main gharelu hinsa kii shikaar mahilaon ko praadhikariyon ke paas khule aam shikaayat karne ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he, yah tark diya jaataa he ki purushon ke saath hone vaali gharelu hinsa ko prativedit nahin kiya jaataa kyonki isse unhen saamaajik rup se kaayar or purushatvheen maan jaataa he

 kumbhandas ashtchhaap ke prasiddh kavi the
 He was a contemporary of Paramanand Das ji
 kumbhandas kaa charit "churaasi vaishnavan kii vaarta" ke anusaar sankalit kiya jaataa he
 Kumbhandas lived in a village called "jamunavatau", some distance away from Mount Govardhan in Braj
 unke ghar main kheti-baadi hoti thi
 From his village, he used to go to Parsoli Chandrasarovar to do kirtan in Srinathji's temple
 unka janm gaurava kshatriya kul main hua tha
 Kumbhandas had seven sons, except Chaturbhajadas who were engaged in all agricultural activities
 unhone 1492 i0 main mahaprabhu vallabhacharya se diksha lee thi
 He was completely disgusted and far from wanting money, honor, dignity
 ek baar akbar badshaah ke bulaane par inhen fatehpur sikri janaa padaa jahaan inkaa bada sammaan hua
 But he was equally sorry for this, as expressed by his post- anumaanath: kumbhandas ji kaa janm govardhan,mathura ke sannikat jamunaavato naamak gram main samvath 1525 vikrami main caitra krishna ekadshi ko hua tha

 'pushtimaarg' main dikshit tathaa shrinath ji ke mandir main kirtankaar ke pad par niyukt hone par bhi unhone apni vritti nahin chodi or ant tak nirdhanavastha main apane parivaar kaa bharan-poshan karte rahe
 In the temple of Srinath ji, Kumbhandas started singing new verses regularly
 'pushti sampradaay' main sammilit hone par unhen kirthan kii hi seva di gayi thi
 Kumbhandas considered Bhagavatkripa to be paramount, he never deviated from his path of faith even in the biggest domestic crisis
 shrinath ji ke shringaar sambandhi padon kii rachana main unki vishesh abhiruchi thi
 Once Vallabhacharya ji was pleased with his couple's post regarding Leela and said - "'you have felt the juice of Nikunj Leela
 " kumbhandas mahaprabhu kii krupa se gadgad hokar bol uthe ki- "mujhe to isi ras kii nitant aavashyaktaa he
 " mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ke lila-pravesh ke baad kumbhandas gosai vittalanath ke sangrakshan main rahakar bhagwaan kaa lila-gaan karne lage
 Vitthalnath Maharaj had great kindness on him
 ve man-hi-man unke nirlobh jivan kii saraahna kiya rate the
 He was counted among the 'poets of Ashtachhap' in Samvat 1602 Vikrami
 bade-bade raja-maharaja aadi kumbhandas kaa darshan karne main apana saubhaahgya maanate the
 The great rasikas and saint mahatmas of Vrindavan used to wish their satsang excellently
 unhone bhagavadbhakti kaa yash sadaa akshunn rakhaa, aarthik sankat or deenta se use kabhi kalankit nahin hone diya
 Once Srivitthalnath wanted to take him along on his journey to Dwarka, he thought that his financial condition would be improved by the offering of Vaishnavas
 kumbhandas shrinath ji kaa viyog ek pal ke liye bhi nahin sah sakate the, par unhone gosai ji kii ajna kaa virodh nahin kiya
 He had gone to the Apsara Kunda with Gosainji to remember that the beauty of Shrinath ji rose from his limbs, the joy of the sweet sweet smile of God rose in the darkness, his heart was hurt by the pain of Madhuryasamrat Nandanandan Are you done? unhone shrinath ji ke viyog main ek pad gaaya- This rare song had a big impact on Srigosai Ji's heart
 ve nahin chaahate the kumbhandas pal bhar ke liye bhi shrinath ji se alag rahen
 He returned to Kumbhandas
 shrinath jika darshan karke kumbhandas swasth hue
 Once, in the court of Mughal Emperor Akbar, a singer sang the post of Kumbhandas
 badshaah ne us pad se aakrisht hokar kumbhandas ko fatehpur sikri bulaayaa
 At first, Kumbhandas did not want to go, but on seeing the special request of soldiers and messengers, he went on foot
 shrinath ji ke sabha sadsy ko akbar kaa aishwarya do kaudi kaa laga
 Kumbhandas's turban was torn, his body was dirty, he was drowning in self-guilt as to which sins he had to appear in front of
 badshaah ne unki badi aavbhagat kii, par kumbhandas ko to aisa laga ki kisi ne unako narak main laakar khadaa kar diya he
 They started thinking that there is a better Braj than Raj Sabha, in which Srinathji himself keeps playing, doing many sports
 akbar ne pad gane kii prarthana kii
 Kumbhandas was a poet of Lord Krishna's majesty, he performed the song - badshaah sahruday the, unhone adarpurvak unako ghar bhej diya
 Maharaja Mansingh visited Braj in Samvat 1620 Vikrami
 unhone vrindavan ke darshan ke baad govardhan kii yatra kii
 Visited Shrinathji
 us samay mrudang or veena ke saath kumbhandas ji kirthan kar rahe the
 Raja Mansingh was greatly influenced by his style of singing
 ve unase milane jamunaavato gayi
 He was amazed to see Kumbhandas's poor condition
 kumbhandas bhagwaan ke rup-chintan main dhyansth the
 On opening his eyes, he asked his niece for posture and mirror, he got the answer that 'the posture was eaten, the mirror was drunk
 ' aashay yah tha ki pani main mukh dekhakar ve tilak karte the
 Maharaja Mansingh came to know of his poverty
 unhone sone kaa darpan dena chaha, bhagwaan ke bhakt ne asweekaar kar diya, moharon kii thili deni chaahi, vishwapati ke sevak ne uski upeksha kar di
 While walking, Mansingh wanted to name the village of Jambuwato Kumbhandas, but he said that "my work is done only by the curry tree and the plum tree
" " raja maansingh ne unki ni:sprihata or tyaag kii saraahna kii, unhone kaha ki "maaya ke bhakt to maine bahut dekhe hai, par vaastavik bhagavadbhakt to aap hi hai
 " vriddhavastha main bhi kumbhandas nity jamunaavato se shrinath ji ke darshan ke liye govardhan aayaa karte the
 One day he stopped near Anodar on the connecting rod
 'ashtchhaap' ke prasiddh kavi chaturbhujadas ji, unke chote putr saath the
 He told Chaturbhuj Das that "now what to do by walking home
" kuch samay baad sharir hi chhootane vaala he
 "gosain Vitthalnathji was present at the time of his death
 gosai ji ne poocha ki "is samay man kis lila main laga he?" kumbhandas ne kaha- laal teri chitwan chitai churaavai or iske anantar yugal swaroop kii chhavi ke dhyaan main pad gaaya- He left the body
 gosai ji ne karun swar se shradhanjali arpit kii ki aise bhagavdiy antardhan ho gayi
 Now the realization of the true Bhagavadkthas on earth was in fact a symbol of disinterestedness, an ideal of renunciation and penance, the ultimate Bhagavadiyya and the simple householder
 samvath 1639 vikrami tak ve ek sau teraa saal kii umr paryant jivit rahe
 The Bering Ground Bridge or Berinjia was a ground bridge that connected the Siberia region of the far northeast of Asia to the far northwestern Alaska region of North America
 is dharti ke patte kii chaudaai uttar se dakshin tak lagbhag 1,600 kimi thi yani iskaa kshetrafal kaafii bada tha
 During the last ice age, the sea level was below today due to the accumulation of a lot of sea water in the form of ice, due to which Berinjia was a land area
 himyug samaapt hone par bahut si yah barf pighali, samudr-tal uthaa or beringia samudr ke neeche dub gaya
 When Berinjia existed, snowfall was less here due to the favorable regional climate and the atmosphere was like the steppes in Central Asia
 itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki us samay kuch maanav samooh asia se aakar yahan bas gaye
 He could not enter North America further than Berinjia because the great glaciers were blocking his path
 iske baad beringia or asia ke bich bhi ek barf kii diwaar khadi hone se beringia par chand hazaar maanav lagbhag 5,000 saalon tak anya maanvon se bina sampark ke himyug ke bhayankar prakope se bache rahe
 About 16,500 years ago, Himanias started melting and they entered North America
 lagbhag usee samay ke aasapaas beringia bhi pani main doobane laga or aaj se qareeb 6,000 varsh pehle tak taton ke rup vaise ho gaye jaise ki aadhunik yug main dekhe jate hai
 Berinjia was about 4,000 km long and 1,600 km wide
 yah aadhunik siberia kii lenaa nadi se lekar canada kii maikenzi nadi tak pahunchataa tha
 Its area was so large that according to some geologists it was less of a ground bridge and more of a subcontinent
 maimathon ke avasheshon kii haddiyon main maujuud colejan par anusandhan karke vaigyanikon ne yah mat diya he ki pashchimi beringia purvi beringia se zayaada shushk or thanda tha or isliye purvi beringia main praaniyon or paudhon kii adhik samruddhi or vividhta thi
 Berinjia was a large area and most of it was free from Himanias and many animals lived on its steppe-like area
 isliye kuch hazaar maanav bhi yahan rah paae
 It is believed that it lived in Berinjia for 5–17 thousand years and had no contact with other human societies
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa sochna he ki ek jamaane main beringian maanvon kii pashanyugiya samskruti puure beringia main purv main siberia ke premorye kshetra se lekar pashchim main alaska tak or dakshin main hokkaido tak faili hui thi
 No remains of Berinjians have been found as this entire subcontinent is now submerged under the ocean
 in beringian logon kaa jivan yaqinan kathin tha kyonki yah ek atyant sard ilaaka tha
 It lived a hunter-gatherer biography and would live on average less than 40 years old
 garmiyon main badi taadaad main machhar or anya keet unhen pareshaan karte honge, jaisaa ki siberia main bhi dekha jaataa he
 When the weather changed and their terrain sank, the Berinjians were forced to migrate to North America, they would have had to learn to live afresh in America's separate ab-o-hawa
 2005 main hue ek anuvaanshiki anusandhan se sanket miltaa he ki shaayad 80 se bhi kam beringiaayiyon kaa vansh aadhunik kaal tak chal paaya he, yani anya sabhi kisi-na-kisi musiibat main padakar bina aage vansh chalaae hi khatm ho gaye
 Animals such as camel, mammoth, American lion, horse, deer, sheep, wolf and steppe buffalo were inhabited on Berinjia
 uttar america main hathi, baldaar ganda or singh ab vilupt hai lekin ve isi jamini pul ke zariye asia se vahaan pahunche
 It is also known from the study that the camel origin actually started in North America and the camel passed through Berinjia and reached other parts of Asia and the world
 itihaaskaar andaaza lagate hai ki beringia main maimath jaise bhimkaay jaanwaron ke bich rahakar beringian maanav unke shikaar main maahir ho gaye the
 Later, when it spread to Alaska and other parts of North America, there he continued to hunt these large animals on a large scale with his mastery
 uttar america mahadweep main maimath, mastodon or baldaar gande ke vilupt ho jane kaa yah ek bada kaaran mana jaataa he

 Malayalam has a rheumatism - malai + am
 is bhashaa ke bhashik bharat ke pashchimi ghat ke garbh main nivas karte hai or isi kaaran yah naam padaa he
 Its correct pronunciation is 'malayam'
 malayalam bhashaa athwa uske sahitya kii utpatti ke sambandh main sahi or vishwasaneey pramaan praapt nahin hai
 Nevertheless, the antiquity of Malayalam literature has been considered to be around a thousand years
 bhashaa ke sambandh main ham keval is nishkarsh par hi pahunch sake hai ki yah bhashaa sanskritj nahin he - yah dravid parivaar kii hi sadasya he
 But it is still debatable whether it is a branch of Tamil, or a language that exists apart from other southern languages, developed from the original Dravidian language
 arthath samasya yahi he ki tamil or malayalam kaa rishta maan-beti kaa he yaa bahan-bahan kaa
 The task of finding the solution to this puzzle by research is the work of language scientists and they are the only ones who can solve this problem
 jo bhi ho, is baat main andeh nahin he ki malayalam kaa sahitya keval usee samay pallavit hone laga tha jabaki tamil kaa sahitya fal phool chukaa tha
 Like Sanskrit literature, we can also call Tamil literature as the source for quenching the thirst of Malayalam
 san 3100 isapurv se lekar 100 isapurv tak yah pracheen tamil kaa ek sthaneey rup thi
 It was influenced by Sanskrit from the first century BCE
 teesri sadi se lekar pandrahavin sadi ke madhya tak malayalam kaa madhyakaal mana jaataa he

 The pupa resides inside the rigid mantle, which is called the pupa sac
 kuch kiton kaa pupa alag bhi rahata he
 Primarily the creatures of Diptera are known to fly in the daytime, but bloodborne species, such as mosquitoes and balmaxis, etc
 are more vigorous in the twilight and Prabhat Vela and are lovers of darkness
 is gana kii bahut si jatiyaan anya chote kiton, kutkiyon aadi kaa aahaar karti hai
 Blood sucking is mostly found in females
 dyptera gana main se kuch to manushyon tathaa jaanwaron main rog failaane ke kaaran vishesh mahatv ke hai

 These hornets have many segments and are of many sizes
 inkaa keetanuon ke vargeekaran main bahut adhik mahatv he
 The mouth of insects of this gana is specially made for sucking or it can be said that they perform both penetration and suction work from their mouth
 ye thos padaarth to bilkul hi nahin kha sakate
 Their labium is membranous and their shaunda is composed mainly of this
 labium kaa antim bhaag, jise lebela kehete hai, andakaar hota he
 They do not have a viducasti and a vertical appendage

 The digestive system of Diptera is simple
 iskaa hriday sidhi nalika maatr hota he
 The respiratory system consists of respiratory tubes, which often form large airways
 adhartantrika-rajju kii gucchhikaaye milakar ek sanhati banaati hai
 The main basis of classification is the composition of the hornet and the angiospermia of the wing
 genera or spishiz main vibhaajan ke liye kabhi aprasiddh or aspasht rachanaaon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana padataa he
 This gana is divided into three subgroups, namely- isaki shrungika main kai khand hote hai or yah bahudhaa sir or vaksh se lanbaa hota he
 The maxillary tentacles have four, five segments and it hangs
 pankh main prishthiya koshika saadharantaya nahin hota or cubital koshika yadi upasthit hui to khuli hoti he
 This sub-division can be divided into twenty-three clans, of which the following are the details of the main clans: is upagan ke dyptera bahudhaa sthool sharirawale hote hai, jinaki shrungikas choti or teen khandwali hoti hai
 In these, the last long section generally becomes a list
 mexilari sparshak ek yaa do khand ke hote hai
 Many members of this subgroup are identified by their narrowness and small forward-facing tentacles
 yah upagan 17 kulon main vibhajit kiya gaya he, jinamein se kuch mahatvapurn kul nimnilikhit hai : The names of some other clans of the Brachisara subgroup are Regionidi, Myededi, Nemstrimaidi, Acroseridae, etc
 is upagan ke dypteraaon kii shrungikaaon main teen khand hote hai, jinamein saadharantaya prishthiya baldaar prashakhaayen hoti hai
 The tangent is of a block
 prishthiya koshika praaia: sarvada hoti he or cubital koshika yaa to sikudi hui yaa band hoti he
 Above the head is a red plexus, on which there is a small leaflet or nail
 yah upagan teen shreniyon main vibhajit hota he: They do not have frontal sutures and the nachchandra is vague or absent
 tilinem anupasthit hota he or cubital koshika lambii hoti he
 It is divided into six clans, the following main ones: iske antargat saamanyat: chauras or kade aavaranwali makkhiyaan hai, jinka sharir samtapi kasherukadandi praaniyon par bahya paraseete jivan ke liye anukool hota he
 In these, the feather is faded, or does not exist at all
 tilinem upasthit yaa anupasthit rahata he
 The external parasite changes its structure by being similar in life
 iske antargat nimnlikhit kul aate hai : The third of this category is total nicety
 dyptera ke naron main vrushan andakaar yaa piriform or bahudhaa rangeen hote hai
 Females have a large number of eggs, ranging from five to more than 100
 adhikansh dyptera andj hote hai
 a few days after copulation, the female lays large numbers of eggs, which have different sizes
 gharelu makkhi 75 se 150 tak kii sankhya main ikatthe hi andey detii he or jivan bhar main 2,000 se bhi adhik andey de leti he
 It has a life of at least six to 10 weeks and a fly can lay eggs only 22 times in its life

 Ovulation is found in some species, such as Myster
 kuch dyptera jarayuj bhi hote hai or ye adhiktar pupidhara shrenee main paae jate hai
 They either give birth to babies or larvae that mature and are pooled as soon as they are born
 is prakaar larva maadaaon main vibhinn kaalon tak rahata he
 Keelin divided the Jarauz pests into two communities in 1916
 pehle samudaay main larva maadaa ke garbhashay main andey se nikalataa he or isamen garbhasth jivan ke liye koi vishesh prakaar kaa anukulan nahin hota
 Many Takinidis and other pests fall into this community
 duusare samudaay main glansina or pupipaara sanmilit hai
 In these, the larvae get food from special nutritive glands in the female uterus
 inhen samudaayon ke larve paripakv avasthaa main janm lete hai or janm lete hi inkaa pupikaran ho jaataa he
 Many diptera have only one generation a year, but normal diptera mostly have many generations in a year
 in pidiyon kaa vardhan ritu evam taap par nirbhar karata he
 Some species of Diptera also take two to three years to complete their life cycle
 dyptera gana ke larvon ko pair nahin hote
 Their movement is done with the help of the crypts and thorns above the body
 inke sharir main adhik se adhik 12 khand hote hai, jinamein se teen vakshiya or anya nau udariy hote hai
 Some of these numbered insects, such as Anaisopodidi and Thirevidi, have more than 12 segments
 adhiktar larvon main spasht sir nahin hota, keval culicidi or nematosra main spasht or ubhara hua sir hota he
 That is why they are placed in the Euscephalus category
 cyclarapha main avshesh sir hota he, isi kaaran ise acephalas shrenee main rakhte hai
 Many other similar larvae are middle-class, have weak head and are classified as hemicephalus
 is prakaar kaa sir adhuraa hota he or vaksh ke bheetar sikoda ja saktaa he
 Due to lack of legs, such larvae live in hiding in rotten street objects, garbage, cow dung, soil, plant tissue and animals body and water
 shrungikas kadachit hi ubhari hui tathaa vibhinn prakaar kii hoti hai or unamem ek se lekar chah tak khand hote he
 They are very strong in the working larvae of Nematosaera, as they search for their food
 kabhi kabhi ye bahut ksheen bhi hote hai
 There is also a strange difference in the composition of the facade of different communities
 nematosra ke kuch kulon main ye adarshabhoot paae jate hai
 The true body in the Cyclarapha is degenerative and is replaced by favorable compositions, which form the cephalopharyngeal skeleton
 maansaahaari kiton ke mukhbhaag tikshn or kantedaar hote hai, daant hote hi nahin
 But vegetative dietary pests have teeth
 mritopajivi kiton main grasaneey tal udrekhit hota he
 In vegetative foods, there is less or no grease and in the carnivores, no mention is made at all
 sambhavat: adhiktar larve sade gale jaev padaarth khate hai
 Some plants of Diptera clans eat only plants, but mostly they are philanthropists or predators of others
 purnavriddhiprapt larva pupa main badal jaataa he
 In this transformation, either the larva flattens its skin, or the same skin forms a rigid waterproof oval cell, called the pupa sac
 yah pupa kosh achal hota he
 Some insects make pupa shells, and sometimes even weaker armor
 is shrenee ke bahut se keet larva yaa pupa kii dasha main hi sheetkaal vyateet karte hai, lekin kuch andey kii dasha main or kuch praudh dasha main sheetanishkriy rahete hai
 The ancient or peripanetic stage is found almost exclusively in the nematosa
 shwasaradhran kii adhiktam sankhya das joda, jaise bibio main, hoti he, parantu sitopsinal or isi tarah kuch anya kiton main ye nau jode hote hai
 There are mainly two pairs of postherpostitis, one anterior and one posterior, but in some insects, mainly philanthropists, only posterior posterior synapses are found
 pupa koshth andar ke bhaar ke kaaran ek nishchit rekha par fat jaataa he
 The adult organism of the severe or wanton Cyclarapha, by inflating the lalatic bladder or tilineum, exits, forming a hole in the pupa sac
 is gana ke mukhya praani puure vishwa main paae jate hai or inamen bahut kam hi samudaay ek hi sthaan tak simit he
 At the same time it is also important that they are found in large numbers and important communities in the tropical region
 dyptera larva athwa praudh, apni donon hi sthitiyon main, bade aarthik mahatv kaa he
 No other class of insect is of more economic importance than Diptera
 kuch mahatvapurn sankramak rogon ke, jaise malaria, sushuptirog, filpaanv, peetajvar ityadi ke, rogotpadak jeev raktashoshak mackhiyon dwaara manushyon main sanchaarit kiye jate hai
 The larvae of these flies are not harmful
 makkhiyaan manushyon tathaa pashuon ke liye ghaatak tathaa vinaashkari siddh hoti hai
 For example, various species of Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes spread malaria and phyllopan from one human to another
 isi prakaar eidisjipty panduswar ke vaahak hai
 Glossinae infects fly infestation in humans and Nogana in pets
 raktchushak choti makkhi dakshini europe or uttari africa main sand fever athwa pappataisi fever ke sankraman ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Similarly, 'horse fly' spreads disease-causing organisms of a type of disease, sara, in India and elsewhere
 gharelu makkhi or isi prakaar kii anya makkhiyaan swat: rogotpaadan kaa kaary na karke keval ghaatak bimariyon ke rogavahak kaa kaary karti hai
 Although they are not indigestible, bowel fever, diarrhea of children, cholecystitis, diarrhea etc
 are the carriers of diseases
 ye ek ore to malamutradi, thook, rogiyon ke shavon, khaad tathaa anya prakaar kii sadi gali vastuon kaa, jinamein vyaadhiyon ke jeevanu rahete hai, sparsh karti hai or duusari ore ve manushyon ke khaadya padaarthon par baithti hai
 They spread disease through two methods
 ek bahya rogantaran, jiske liye makkhi ke sampurna sharir kii rachana upyukt hoti he or doosraa aantar rogantaran, jo makkhi ke bhojan karne or ugalane yaa vaman karne kii aadat se hota he
 The larvae of many flies harm agricultural plants
 inamen se kuch mahatvapurn makkhiyaan hai, jaise falmakshikaaye, jo saare sansar main falon kaa naash karne ke liye prasiddh hai
 The fruit flies of the Mediterranean are found on 120 types of nutritious plants
 bharat main dekas dorselis falmakshika falon or tarkariyon ko bahut adhik kshati pahunchaati he
 There are many other similar flies, which cause great harm to plants here, such as gourd fly, watermelon or foot fly and other flies which are destructive of tarai, bitter gourd etc
 yada kada tamaato par bhi inkaa akraman hota he
 Members of this class harm citrus plants, turmeric, ginger, mango, plum, cardamom, lentils, paddy, cotton, madar, custard apple, etc
 kuch ke larva ann sambandhi or duusari fasalon kii jadon ko adhik haani pahunchaate hai
 Similarly, cabbage maggots and onion flies cause great damage to cabbage and onions
 kuch duusari mackhiyon ke larva manushyon or gharelu jaanwaron ko kshati pahunchaate hai
 The disease caused by his presence comes under myiasis in simple words
 maaiyaasis us sthiti ko kehete hai, jisamen manushya yaa jaanavar ke sharir kaa koi bhaag dyptera gana kii mackhiyon ke andey yaa larve se aakraant rahata he
 These larvae are any natural holes in the body; Skin ulcers are found in alimentary canal or body tissues
 is shrenee main europe or america kii varble makkhi aati he, jo bharat main punjab main bhi pai jaati he
 It causes great harm by penetrating the skin of the animal
 isi prakaar ghode kii vadhai ghode or khachcharon kii aaharanlika par akraman karti hai
 The slaughter of the sheep lays eggs in the nostrils of the sheep and the larvae emerge from the eggs and reach the brain

 Lenin considers his supporters a champion of socialism and the working class, while critics remember him as the leader of a dictatorial power responsible for political atrocities and mass killings
 leninavaad Lenin's idea was not to enter politics, but he gave birth to Marxist theory, Lenin has been rejected by many countries of the world today, because Lenin's violent theory promotes violence in the world

 Even today, North Korea is the biggest example of Lenin's violent attitude in many countries

 It can be seen in this way that the image of Lenin is being removed from different countries
 rus bhi unako apana prerak nahi maanata he
 a nationalist ideology is required for a nation
 lekin lenin ne yuddh ke samay rasiyaa ke logon se rasiyaa ke viruddh shaastra uthaane kii apil kii jo kisi bhi raashtra ke liye ghotak he 
 Therefore, it would be appropriate to view Lenin as the father of a violent terrorism, not nationalist
 haa ye satya he kii lenin kaa raajnneeti par prabhaav rahaa, lekin usase bada satya ye he kii lenin kii hinsak vichaardhaara ko aaj samaapt kiya ja rahaa he, or raashtra ke uchit shanti or ahimsa kii rashtravaadi vichaardhaara ko apanaaya ja rahaa he
 Which is the best work for any nation

 swadeshi kaa arth he - 'apane desh kaa'
 The goals of this strategy were to boycott the goods made in Britain and to make economic loss to imperialist Britain by making more and more use of goods made in India and to create employment for the people of India
 yah britani shashan ko ukhaad phenkane or bharat kii samgr aarthik vyavastha ke vikaas ke liye apanaaya gaya saadhan tha
 The Swadeshi movement received a lot of strength from the anti-bang-breaking public awakening of 1905

 aage chalakar yahi swadeshi aandolan mahatma gandhi ke swatantrata aandolan kaa bhi kendra-bindu ban gaya
 He called it "the soul of Swaraj"
 swadeshi aandolan visheshkar us aandolan ko kehete hai jo bang-bhang ke virodh main na keval bengal apitu puure british bharat main chalaa
 Its main purpose was to adopt the object of our country and boycott the object of another country
 yadhyapi swadeshi kaa yah vichaar bang-bhang se bahut purana he
 The first slogan of Swadeshi in India was given by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay by proposing a Vigyan Sabha in Bhadra number 1279 of "vangadarshan" i
e
 1872 AD
 unhone kaha tha-"jo vigyaan swadeshi hone par hamaara das hota, vah videshi hone ke kaaran hamaara prabhu ban baitha he, ham log din ba din saadhanheen hote ja rahe hai
 Like the guest of life in the guest house, we are in the ashram of Prabhu, it has become a great guest for the Indians of India
 " After this, Bholanath Chandra gave the slogan of Swadeshi in 1874 in "mukherjee's Magazine", promoted by Shambhuchandra Mukhopadhyay
 unhone likhaa tha- a poem titled 'swadeshi Textile Accepted' appeared in the Saraswati magazine of July 1903
 rachanaakaar kaa naam nahin tha kintu varsh bhar ke ankon kii suchi se gyaat hota he ki vah patrika ke sampadak mahavir prasad dvivedi kii rachana thi
 Some parts of the poem are quoted - 'swadeshi' kaa vichaar congress ke janm se pehle hi de diya gaya tha
 When the Bang-disbanded in 1905, the Swadeshi slogan was adopted in full swing
 usee varsh congress ne bhi iske paksh main mat prakat kiya
 The indigenous capitalists were opening mills at that time, so the Swadeshi movement proved very beneficial for them

 It was illegal in those days to chant the slogan "vande Mataram" in public and many youths received punishments other than cane for slogans
 jila prashasan ne swagatsmiti par yah shart lagaai ki pratinidhiyon kaa swaagat karte samay kisi haalat main "vande maataram" kaa naaraa nahin lagaaya jaayegaa
 The welcome committee accepted it

 log is par raji nahin hue, isliye adhiveshan yaheen samaapt ho gaya
 But it increased public excitement
 lokmaanya tilak or ganesh shrikrishna khaparde bhi is sambandh main kalakatta pahunche or bengal main bhi shivaji utsav kaa pravartan kiya gaya
 Rabindra Nath Thakur wrote the famous poem titled 'shivaji' on this occasion
 10 june ko tees hajaar kalakattavasiyon ne lokmaanya tilak kaa viraat juluus nikaala
 During these days many new newspapers came out in Bengal, in which "vande Mataram" and "yugantar" are famous
