 The Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology defines scientific and technical words in Hindi and all other Indian languages and develops new words
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad vaigyanik-takneekee shabdaawalee ke liye shiksha mantralay ne san 1950 main board kii sthapana kii
 In 1952, the construction of vocabulary started under the auspices of the Board
 antat: 1960 main kendriya hindi nideshaalay or 1961 i
 main vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee ayog kii sthapana hui
 Thus the terminology prepared on various occasions was published under the title 'definitive Vocabulary', which on the one hand was intended to provide the basis for the coordination work of the Commission on Scientific and Technical Terminology and on the other hand the writers were unanimous for new concepts in the interim period
 The term was to be provided
 swatantraaa ke baad bharat ke samvidhan ke nirmaataaon kaa dhyaan desh kii sabhi pramukh bhashaaon ke vikaas kii ore gaya
 In the Constitution, Hindi was recognized as the official language of the Union and the Central Government was entrusted with the responsibility to develop and enrich Hindi
 tadnusaar bharat sarkaar ke kendriya shiksha mantralay ne samvidhan ke anuchhed 351 ke adheen hindi kaa vikaas evam samruddhi kii anek yojanaayen aarambh kin
 In these schemes, the program of creation of technical vocabulary in Hindi was also included so that all branches of knowledge-science could be studied and taught through Hindi
 shabdaawalee nirmaan kaarykram ko sahi disha dene ke liye 1950 main shiksha salaahkaar kii adhyakshata main vaigyanik shabdaawalee board kii sthapana kii gai
 Earlier this work was done by the Hindi Unit under the Ministry of Education, but later during the construction of Hindi vocabulary of various subjects, it became known that this work is much more vast, intensive and multidimensional
 iske puure hone main bahut saky lagegaa or is kaary ke liye sabhi vishyon ke visheshgyon evam bhashavidon kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Therefore, the Government of India on October 1, 1961, eminent scientist Dr

 The Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology was established under the chairmanship of Kothari so that the work of vocabulary construction could be implemented in the correct and comprehensive perspective
 hindi tathaa anya aadhunik bhartiya bhashaaon ko prashasan, shiksha tathaa pariksha kaa madhyam banane kaa sapana tathaa sankalp swantatrata prapti ke baad bharat ke samvidhan nirmaataaon ne bahut sujh-boojh tathaa vidhaar mathan ke pashchaat bharat kii janata ke sammukh rakhaa
 This resolution, this dream was an ideal historical decision taken keeping in mind the cultural and linguistic diversity of India
 yah ek aisa sankalp tha, jo bharat kii mitti main janmi pragna ko gyaan-vigyaan ke kshetra main moulikta pradaan karne tathaa bhartiyata ko surakshit rakhane ke liye liya gaya tha
 This was necessary for national unity and social development and was a futuristic decision which contained the spirit of 'sarvebhavantu Sukhinah'
 jab koi sapana dekha jaataa he, jab koi sankalp liya jaataa he, jab koi adarsh saamne rakhaa jaataa he, to use murtarup dene ke liye kargar yojanaon or unke kriyanvayan kii aavashyaktaa bhi hoti he
 In order to implement the legislation made for Hindi and other Indian languages in the 351st section of the constitution, the government made several schemes, including the ambitious scheme for development, standardization and uniformity of scientific and technical terminology, which later became the Government of India
 Also included in education policy

 For this reason, it was not an effortless effort but was bound to take some unnatural nature

 Such synonyms, which can convey the information of the original technical concept in translated language, not by the work of investigator or scholar, but by subject matter expert and linguist
 shabdaawalee nirmaan kii is asahaj prakriya ne us samay kai visangatiyon ko janm diya
 Many scholars started the development of scientific and technical terminology at that time
 kuch vidwaanon ne shabdaawalee ko sanskritnishtha karnaa chaha, to kuch ne ise urdu-farsi or hindustani kahi jane vaali bhashaa main dhaalnaa chaha
 At that time there were some scholars who offered to accept the technical words of English by transliteration into Devanagari but the multidisciplinary and huge vocabulary of these most scientific and technical subjects was given to the grammar of its language, its nature and students, professors, researchers, The aspirations of translators, script writers, were not being fulfilled and the way people built vocabulary Were did not have him meet the inherent effect in the dignity of the Constitution
 ek hi takneekee shabd ke kai-kai paryaay uplabdh hone se ek aisi arajak sthiti utpann ho gai jisane shabdaawalee nirmaan ke niyojan tathaa prabandhan kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 In such a situation, the Government of India thought it appropriate to take up this task and on 1 October 1961, the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology was established in the room of the Permanent Commission under the President's order
 padam vibhushan professor daulat singh kothaari jaise swapndrashtaa, prasiddh shikshavid tathaa murdhanya vaigyanik ko ayog kaa pehla adhyaksh banaakar bharat sarkaar ne yah siddh kiya ki ve vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee ke vikaas hetu gambhir prayaas ke liye katibaddh he

 ayog kii yah yojana he ki sabhi vishyon kii akhil bhartiya shabdaawalee ko ab ek hi sangrah main prakashit kar diya jaae taaki shabd-nirmaataaon ko ye shabdaawaliyaan ek hi granth main uplabdh ho saken
 In 1982, at the request of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Commission planned to compile the south linguistic equivalents of words and phrases of common use of medical science and publish them with Hindi
 is yojana ke antargat lagbhag 5-6 hajaar shabdon kaa sankalan kiya ja chukaa he
 As a first step, the Hindi synonyms of English words and phrases have been prepared and their Tamil synonyms have been prepared and the languages of Bengali, Punjabi, Marathi and Oriya languages are being finalized
 ayog dwaara nirmit shabdaawalee kaa uddeshy shabd-sangrah tak simit rahanaa nahin he balki vishvavidhyalay str par shikshan main uskaa prayog hona bhi uskaa antim lakshya he
 The Commission's terminology should be used in all text texts, all original authors, translators and producers of reference literature, students and professors should use the terminology of the Commission, for this, the Commission has started several schemes
 inamen se ek pramukh yojana takneekee shabdaawalee kaaryshaalaaon ke aayojan kii he
 Under the Terminology Workshop Scheme, the Commission organizes workshops in various disciplines in various universities and higher technical institutions in which members of the Commission's faculty or expert scholars, linguists and word-makers of various disciplines are introduced and introduced by the Commission
 The lecturers present in the workshop in relation to them, Rtranikon, the authors consider the translators consultation
 in kaaryshaalaaon main praayah do-teen vishyon ko ek-saath rakhaa jaataa he or inamen un vishyon se sambandhit aasapaas ke mahavidhyalayon ke praadhyaapak sahabhaagi ke rup main aamantrit kiye jate hai
 It has been observed that these workshops have been very successful in their purpose as through the deliberations in these workshops, the examination of the use of technical terminology produced by the Commission is conducted, all the participating professors are aware of the standard of terminology produced by the Commission
 Giving them direction to use standard terminology in the teaching of their subjects and their subjects Their hesitation in teaching Hindi through Hindi is over
 shabdaawalee-nirmaan kii prakriya kii jaankaree sakasham vidwaanon se praapt hone ke baad un praadhyaapakon ko ayog kii shabdaawalee sweekaar karne main suvidha hoti he
 They also become aware that it is mandatory for technical words to use the same Hindi equivalents everywhere so that chaos does not arise by using different words for the same concept
 kaaryshaala main vichaar-vimarsh ke parinamswaroop anek shabdon ke hindi paryaayon par punarvichaar bhi kiya jaataa he
 After the creation of technical terminology in various subjects, the Commission also started the plan for the creation of definitions
 shabdaawalee yaa shabd-sangrahon main angreji takneekee shabdaawalee tathaa unke hindi paryaay maatr hote hai, kintu paribhaasha-koshon main angreji takneekee shabd, uskaa hindi paryaay or uske baad teen-chaar panktiyon main hindi main uski paribhaasha di jaati he
 Definition dictionary helps the student, teacher or researcher greatly in understanding the technical word concept of any subject correctly
 vastutah paribhaasha ke aadhaar par hi kisi shabd ko upyukt tehraaya ja saktaa he
 Also, the ability to use technical terms is also clear from the definitions
 is tarah paribhaasha-kosh ek prakaar se shabdaawalee-nirmaan kii prakriya ke hi vistaar ke rup main he kyonki takneekee shabdon ko unki paribhaashaon athwa vyakhyaaon ke madhyam se hi thik se samajha ja saktaa he
 The Vocabulary Commission has so far published about 56 definitions
 inkaa sambandh samaajavigyaan evam manviki, moolbhoot vigyaan, anuprayukt vigyaan aadi sabhi se he
 These include the latest subjects of science, for example - econometrics, electronics, fluid mechanics, mapology, rock science, plant genetics, agro-entomology, etc
 in paribhaasha-koshon kii upyogita kii drushti se anek vishyon ke ek se adhik paribhaasha kosh bhi prakashit kiye gaye hai
 For example, five definitions of botany, three definitions of chemistry, two definitions of education, etc
 takneekee shabdaawalee kaa nirmaan hindi main paathya pustakon ke nirmaan kaa pehla charan he
 Before changing the medium, it is mandatory to produce an appropriate number of university-level text books in each subject
 ye pustaken na keval vishay kii drushti se ucch stareey hon apitu inaki shabdaawalee bhi maanak ho or unamem sarvatra ekarupata ho
 Accordingly, since 1959, the Ministry of Education introduced the Granth-making scheme in Hindi
 is yojana ke antargat swayan ayog dwaara evam vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon, academik sansthaaon or rajya sarkaron ke madhyam se or saath hi nijee prakashkon ke sahyog se pustakon ke anuwaad, moulik lekhan evam prakaashan kaa kaarykram aarambh kiya gaya
 The Vocabulary Commission started the program of translation, original writing and publication
 shabdaawalee ayog ne anuwaad, moulik lekhan ke liye sheershakon kaa chunaav karne ke uddeshy se vividh vishyon main 16 visheshgy samitiyon kaa gathan kiya or unke paraamarsh se is kaarykram ke antargat anek pustaken prakashit kin
 The National Policy on Education in 1968 emphasized the rapid efforts to adopt all Indian languages including Hindi as the medium of instruction at the university level
 tadnusaar shiksha mantralay ne prayek rajya sarkaar ko vishvavidhyalay str ke granthon ke nirmaan ke liye ek-ek karod rupye dene kii manjuuri di
 Since then, financial assistance is being given to various states under this scheme
 is yojana par punarvichaar karne ke liye 1987 main dalal samiti tathaa 1994 main kolhatkar samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya
 The brief is as follows: vishvavidhyalay-stareey ucch vishyon main adhyayan tathaa adhyaapan ke liye paathya pustaken hi paryaapt nahin hotin
 In order to understand many deep topics properly, it is necessary to present the material available in high-level journals and bibliographies in the form of textbooks, monographs, select books and text collections
 pathmala ek lekhak dwaara ek hi vishay main likhit pustika ke rup main hoti he jabaki paath-sangrah main ek hi vishay par vibhinn lekhakon ke lekh sankalit kiye jate hai
 The updated information of a subject or group of subjects is also presented under several headings
 shabdaawalee ayog ne gyaan-vigyaan kii anek pathmalaon, chaynikaaon or paath-sangrahon kaa nirmaan or prakaashan 1980 se aarambh kiya tha
 So far, about 10 text-books / text-collections and 10 selections have been published

 Today, faster lasers, larger spot areas, bladeless flap incisions, intraoperative pachymetry and optimized wavefront and guided techniques significantly improve process reliability compared to 1991
 However, the fundamental limitations of excimer lasers and undesirable destruction of the eye veins have spawned research into several options for "plain" LASIK, including LASEK, epi-lasik, Sub Bowman Keratomileusis aka Thin Flap LASIK, PRK wavefront-guided and modern intraocular Lens

 6 janvari 2011 main, Waxler anurodh kiya he ki "sabhi LASIK ke upkarnon ke liye khaadya or aushadh ke ayukta epad anumodan ko waapas lene ke liye or LASIK ke upkarnon kaa ek svaichhik yaad saath ek sthaayee aankh kii mahamari ko rokane ke prayaas main ek saarvajanik swasthya salaahkaar jari LASIK netra shalya chikitsa ke liye istemaal kiya lezaron or microkeratomes kii vajah se chot

 The manufacturers of LASIK and their partners withheld investigative safety and effectiveness information from their investigational device exemption reports to the FDA
 In addition, they concealed LASIK injuries from the FDA within the context of disposing of numerous out-of-court lawsuits
 clinics pryojit idii padhai cheri uthaaya, par roak lagaai he or epad se chupaaya data he ki spasht rup se atyadhik pratikul ghatana dar ke saath LASIK se pataa chalaa he
 These activities were an industry-wide effort, organized in full or part by manufacturers and their partners, bypassing FDA law and regulation orders

 "before undergoing a refractive process, you should carefully weigh the risks and benefits based on your own personal value system and avoid being influenced by friends that have done the procedure or encouraged doctors to do so Try: The FDA website on the states of LASIK "consequently, potential patients still need to fully understand all potential issues and complications

 Prior to ametropia laser eye surgery and other risk factors depend on the degree of risk for a patient suffering from visual side effects such as halos, double vision, contrast sensitivity and loss of glare after LASIK
 For this reason, it is important to take into account the individual risk potential of a patient and not just the average probability for all patients

 Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction or, more popularly, Faraday's law of induction, is a fundamental law of electromagnetism
 transafarmaron, vidyut janitron aadi kii karypranali isi siddhanth par aadhaarit he
 According to this rule, vidyutchumbakeey preran ke siddhanth kii khoj maaikel farade ne san 1831 main kii, or joseph henry ne bhi usee varsh swatantra rup se is siddhanth kii khoj kii
 Faraday presented this rule mathematically as follows - jahaan Lange's law applies to the direction of the force generated
 sankshep main lange kaa niyam yahi kahata he ki utpann vidyutvahak bal kii disha aisi hoti he jo utpann karne vaale kaaran kaa virodh kar sake
 The minus sign in the above formula indicates this
 vastav main 'farade kaa niyam' kai charnon main viksit hone ke baad apane vartmaan rup main aayaa he
 According to Faraday's law of induction introduced in 1831, the potential produced in a closed circuit is proportional to the number of magnetic flux lines crossing that circuit
 farade ne yah niyam maukhik rup se diya tha or isamen 'chumbakeey flux rekhaon kii sankhya' kii baat thi jis pariklpana ko usne hi viksit kiya tha
 For this reason, his concept could not be spread in the academic world
 1845 main jaakar newman ne is niyam ko ganitiya rup main likhaa- Where φ b { \ displaystyle \ Phi _ {B}} is a magnetic flux which is defined as follows- yahan tal s { \ displaystyle S} koi bhi tal he jiske kinare par uparokt band paripath sthit he
 Using the definition of potential, the following equations can be written as- jahaan e paripath ke kisi bindu par vidyut kshetra he
 You can also write Faraday's law using the Stokes theorem as follows: yahan prayukt rin chihn henrik lange kaa moulik yogadan he
 Lange stated that if the circuit is closed, the direction of current generated in the circuit is such that it opposes the reason for which it is generated

 Veto, the Latin word meaning "I prohibit", is the right of a country official to unilaterally withhold a law
 abhyaas main, vito nirpeksh ho saktaa he kisi prastaav ko roak sakate hai yaa simit kar sakate hai, jaisaa ki sanyukt raashtra america kii vidhaayi prakriya main hota he, kisi kanoon par raashtrapati kaa vito ko donon sadan or seenet kaa do-tihaai vot radd kar saktaa he
 a veto to prevent any such changes; Not giving them, presumably, unlimited rights

 The more the holder uses the veto to support the status quo, the more useful the veto is
 roman kaunsul or tribune se vito kii avadharana paidaa hui he
 In a particular year, one of the two consuls who were demoted could stop military or civil decisions made by the other; Any tribune had the right to unilaterally stop legislation passed by the Roman Senate

 The veto of a tribune did not prevent the passage of a bill in the Senate, but meant impeding the enforcement of the law
 tribune vidhansabha main vidheyak ko laane se rokane ke liye bhi vito kaa istemaal kar saktaa tha
 Since the decision-making process generally required the approval of both magistrates, the magistrates also had the power to veto
 yadi koi ek asahmat hota hai, yaa donon main koi bhi duusare kii karrwai ko rokane ke liye intercesiyo kaa aahvaan kar saktaa he
 In the concept of wielding Roman power, not only to manage the affairs of the country; Rather, the veto used to be a mandatory component to limit and liberalize the power of the country's high officials and institutions
 westminster pranali or zyaadaatar sanvaidhanik rajtantr main, kanoon ko rokane ke vito adhikaar kaa upyog shaayad hi kabhi hua ho, yah shakti samraat ke liye arakshit rahi thi
 In practice, the king exercises his prerogative on the advice of his principal advisor, the Prime Minister
 ucch sadan ko vito kaa istemaal kaa adhikaar he
 However, it was first reformed by a Liberal government and then by the Labor government that their powers were limited

 In Spain, Article 115 of the Constitution provides that the King will approve any law passed by the General Court within 15 days of his passing it; Without the approval of the king, although it is not constitutionally provided, the Bill would not be synonymous with law
 stachut of westminster ke baad united kingdom ke crown or sansad ne vito nahin kiya hoga yaa australian rashtramandal ke sansad ke adhinium ko is aadhaar par ki united kingdom ke kanoon or hit ke liye pratikul he, nirast nahin kar saktaa he

 However, according to the Australian Constitution, the Queen can veto any bill that has been approved by the governor-general within one year of being approved by the Legislative Assembly
 
is adhikaar kaa istemaal kabhi nahin kiya gaya he
 The right to veto a bill passed by both houses of the Australian Parliament
 Principle: The Australian governor-general holds or, more technically, has the right not to approve on the advice of the Prime Minister
 This can be done without consulting Sowran
 baharhaal, yah arakshit adhikaar sanvaidhanik rup se vivaadaaspad he or aisa avasar kab aa jaae ki is adhikaar ke prayog karne kii jarurat pad jaae, iskaa anumaan lagaana kathin he
 If a bill is passed by Parliament which is criminal, illegal constitution and violation of the constitution, then it is possible that the Governor General may need to do so
 However, one could argue that the government will rarely introduce a bill which is likely to be rejected
 australia rashtramandal ke sankshipt sanvaidhanik itihaas kii vajah se bahut saare shahi pratinidhi ke arakshit adhikaar aparikshit hote hai or parampara kaa anupaalan yah he ki praant kaa pramukh apane mukhyamantri kii salaah par kaam karata / karti he
 As far as the Governors of the six states are concerned, which are federated under the Australian Commonwealth; To some extent they have a different status
 jab tak australia adhinium 1986 nahin ban gaya, harek rajya sanvaidhanik rup se sidhe british rajshahi par nirbhar tha
 Although from 1986 onwards, they are a completely independent entity, although the queen still appoints the governor on the advice of the country's premier prime minister
 isiilie rajshahi yaa britain kii sansad governor yaa desh kii vidhayika ke kisi krity par vito yaa palat nahin sakati / saktaa he
 Ironically, the province is far more independent of the monarchy than the federal government and the legislature
 The constitution of the provinces determines the role of the governor
 saamaanya taur par, shahi sweekruti ko bhi roak lene samet, samprabhutaa ke jo kuch bhi adhikaar hai governor unka prayog karata he
 In the United Kingdom, the royal veto was last used by Queen Anne in 1707 with the Scottish Militia Bill 1708
 congress ke donon sadanon dwaara paarit sabhi vidhaan ko raashtrapati ke samaksh prastut kiya janaa jaruri he
 It is requested in the capacity of the President as the head of the country
 agar raashtrapati vidhaan ko manjuuri detaa he, vah isamen hastakshar karata he agar vah sweekaar nahin karata he, to use rabgaiyr hastakshar kiye das dinon ke bheetar, ravivaar ko chhodkar, sanyukt rajya america ke congress ko, jahaan kagress ke satr main ise taiyaar kiya gaya tha, lautaanaa hota he
 Constitutionally, the President is required to express his objections to the law in writing and constitutionally Congress is required to consider them and reconsider the law
 prabhaav main, yah karrwai ek vito he
 If both houses of Congress defy the veto by a two-thirds majority, it becomes law without the President's signature
 anyathaa, vidheyak kanoon banane main vifal rahata he jab tak ki yah raashtrapati ke samaksh phir se pesh na kiya jaae or vah is par hastakshar nahin kar den
 The bill can also become law without the President's signature, provided he fails to sign it within ten days after it is presented to him
 If the Congress session is less than ten days after the adjournment of the session, and if the Congress adjourns before the President is given ten days for signature, the bill fails to become law
 
 is prakriya kaa prayog jab ek aupchaarik upkaran ke rup main kiya jaataa he tab yah pocket vito kehalaata he
 In 1996, Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed the line-item Veto Act 1996
 yah adhinium raashtrapati ko puure vidheyak par viton karne or congress ko waapas bhejne ke bajaae viniyog vidheyak se bajet vyay ke vishesh vishay par vito kii anumati detaa he
 However, this line-item veto was immediately challenged by a member of Congress who disagreed
 1998 main, supreme court ne ghoshnaa kii ki line-item vito asanvaidhanik tha
 The court found that the language of the constitution is necessary in every bill introduced before the President for approval or complete cancellation
 ek karrwai he jiske dwaara raashtrapati nahin ho saktaa he lene ke liye or ke kuch hisson ko chunate hai jo sweekrut bill karne ke liye yaa raashtrapati ko sweekrut raashi rajya ke abhinay kii ek vidhayak ke rup main bajaay ek sir or karypalika - or vishesh rup ke rup main ek vidhayak congress puri kii abhinay main jagah - is prakaar siddhant kii shaktiyon judaai kaa ulanghan
 In 2006, Senator Bill introduced the Bill First Legislative Line Item Veto Act 2006 for the first time in the United States Senate
 haalanki vaastavik vidhaayi vito pradaan karne ke bajaae, tathaapi, is adhinium ke dwaara banaai gai prakriya yah adhikaar pradaan karti he ki, agar raashtrapati bajet vidheyak ke kisi bajtiy line item ko radd kar dete hai, jise unhone pehle kaanoon banane ke liye hastakshar kiya tha, to yah shakti unhen pehle se hi amareeki samvidhan ke anuchhed dwitiya ke anuroop praapt he - congress ko das dinon ke bheetar unke anurodh par matdaan karnaa padataa he
 Because the subject of the President's request has already become a law, the voting by Congress is a simple legislative proceeding, not a veto of any sort - whether it is a line-item, legislative or other
 sadan ne is upaay ko paarit kar diya, lekin seenet ne is par kabhi bhi vichaar nahin kiya, so vidheyak kii avadhi samaapt ho gayi or yah kabhi bhi kanoon nahin ban paaya
 In 1982, the Supreme Court removed the unicameral legislature veto, along with the grounds for division of powers and grounds for violation of constitutional requirements for bicameralism by a House
 maamla ienes banaam chaddha kaa tha, kenya main paidaa hue ohio ke chaatr ke videshi mudra se judaa maamla tha, jiske mata-pita bharat ke the

 Thus, he could not go anywhere when his student visa expired, as no country accepted him, so he stayed there for more than the visa period and was then given a show cause notice asking him to leave the United States
 Why not be thrown out bahut saare adhiniyamon main se avrajan or rashtriyata adhinium ek hai, jise congress ne 1930 ke dashakon main paarit kiya hai, jiske praavdhaan ne donon hi sadan ko yah anumati pradaan kii he ki vidhayika keval ek prastaav paarit karke karypalika kii kisi agency dwaara liye gaye faisla ko radd kar den
 In this case, Chadha's deportation was adjourned and the House of Representatives passed a resolution overturning the adjournment, so that the deportation process could continue
 seenet kii sahmati ke bina or raashtrapati ke vichararth or anumodan ke bina pratinidhi sabha ne kanoon paarit kiya to iskaa nateeja yah hua ki yah maamla adaalat main chalaa gaya
 Thus, in this case, the Constitutional principle of two houses and the principle of allocation of rights were disregarded and the executive decision was weighed down by this legislature
 continental congress ke raashtrapatiyon ko vito kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 Nor could the President under the Article of Confederation veto the act of Congress, although they had certain recess and reserved powers that were not necessarily available to the predecessor President of the Continental Congress
 lekin sanyukt rajya america samvidhan ke kanoon ban jane, vito kaa adhikaar "sanyukt rajya america ke raashtrapati" kii oopaadhi vaale shaks ko diya gaya tha 
 The authority of the presidential veto was first exercised on several states between April 5, 1792, when a George Washington veto bill designed to dispense delegates
 congress pehle vito ovarrode raashtrapati - jo he, aapattiyon ke baavjood raashtrapati kanoon paarit bill ek main -
 3 march 1845 ko The us The majority of states have a provision by which a legislative decision can be vetoed by the governor
 iske alaava, inamen adhikansh rajya governor ko line-item vito kaa prayog karne kii anumati dete hai
 The us In seven states, the governor has a forward veto
 udhaaharan ke liye, illinois main, governor vidheyak main vishisht parivartanon kii siforishein kar sakate hai
 The state legislature then approves the change by majority vote or ignores the forward veto with a 60% majority
 agar vidhansabha badlaav ko sweekaar nahin karata he to koi kanuunu nahin banataa he
 The parliamentary republics of Europe, including Italy, Portugal, Ireland, France, Latvia, Ukraine, and Hungary, have always been allowed a limited veto of the president on legislation 
 austria ke raashtrapati ke paas takneekee taur par vito jaisaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 However, if they refuse to sign a bill passed by the Legislative Assembly, the President can order a referendum

 a President can refuse to sign a bill only twice and a referendum is held only once
 ireland ke raashtrapati, aise kisi vidheyak ko, jise ve asanvaidhanik maanate hai, manjuuri dene se inkaar kar sakate hai; is vidheyak ke maamle main pehali baar council of state main mashvira karne ke baad ireland ke supreme court ke paas vichaar ke liye bhej diya jaataa he, vahi is par antim faisla karata he
 It is a widely used reserved right

 The latter can never be exercised by this fact, as the majority of the Senate is almost always controlled by today's government, which usually prevents a third of Dyl Eireann from joining the opposition

 Since the parliament can override the veto by a simple majority, it is a very weak veto
 yahi praavdhaan france or latvia main bhi maujuud he
 While such a limited veto cannot thwart the will of a steadfast parliamentary majority, it may be late and the parliamentary majority may have to rethink the matter
 In Italy, the President of the Republic can also call for elections to the new parliament
 jo inaki sthiti ko majboot banaata he
 The President of Portugal can refuse to sign a bill or send it or some part of it to the Portuguese Constitutional Court
 agar raashtrapati kisi vidheyak ko bagaiyr asanvaidhanik ghoshit kiye hastakshar karne se inkaar kar de to essembly of republic ise phir se paarit kar saktaa he or tab vah raashtrapati kii raay ke bagaiyr hi kanoon ban jaataa he
 The President of Latvia can adjourn a bill for a period of two months, during which a referendum can be held by the public, so that a specified number of signatures can be collected
 Presumably this is a strong veto, as the president can appeal to the public against the will of Parliament and the government
 ukraine ke raashtrapati kisi vidheyak par hastakshar karne se inkaar kar sakate hai or apane prastaav ke saath sansad ko waapas bhej sakate hai
 If the Parliament agrees to their proposals, the President should sign the bill

 If Parliament overturns their veto, the president has to sign the bill

 In the Constitution of Poland of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there used to be an institution, called the Liberum veto
 sabhi vidheyak ko sarvasammat se sejam main paarit hona hota tha or agar koi vidhayak kisi maamle ko asweekrut kar matdaan detaa to isse na keval vidheyak par vito lagata; balki vah vidhansabha satr hi bhang ho jaataa
 yah avadharana "polish loktantr" ke siddhant se nikal kar aayaa, ki kisi bhi kshetra ke abhijaat kaa saar utana hi acha he jitna kii dusron kaa, is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki unki bhautik sthiti kitni ucch yaa nimna he
 It was never put into practice under the rule of strong Polish royal dynasties, but ended in the middle of the 17th century and alternative regimes followed
 jaisaa ki ummid thi, vidhayika ke adhikaar ko pangu banane ke liye is vito shakti kaa adhik se adhik lagaataar upyog kiya jane laga or, isamen nammaatr ke kamjor rajiyon kii kadi jud gayi, jiske kaaran antat: aanevaali sadi main polish desh kaa vibhaajan or vighatan ho gaya

 ye rajasthan se hai
 Once the Maharaj of Hastinapur was doing penance on the banks of the Ganges
 unke rup-soundarya se mohit ho kar ganga jaangh par baith gayi
 Ganga said, "O Rajan! i am the daughter of the sage Ganga and have come to marry you
 " is par maharaj prateep bole, "gange! tum meri dahini jaangh par baithi ho
 The wife should be vamangi, right thigh is the symbol of the son, so i accept you as my daughter-in-law
 " yah sun kar ganga vahaan se chali gayi
 Now Maharaja Pratip started doing intense penance to get a son
 unke tap ke falswaroop unhen putr kii prapti hui jiskaa naam unhone shantanu rakhaa
 When Shantanu was young, Maharaja Pratipa went to heaven, ordering him to marry Ganga
 pita ke aadesh kaa paalan karne ke liye shantanu ne ganga ke paas jaakar unase vivaah karne ke liye nivedan kiya
 Ganga said, "rajan! i can marry you, but you have to promise that you will not interfere in any of my work
" " shantanu ne ganga ke kahe anusaar vachan de kar unase vivaah kar liya
 Maharaj Shantanu had eight sons from the Ganga's womb, out of which seven were taken away by Ganga into the Ganges river and due to his promise, Maharaj Shantanu could not speak anything
 jab ganga kaa aathvaan putr hua or vah use bhi nadi main bahaane ke liye le jane lagi to raja shantanu se rahaa na gaya or ve bole, "gange! tumne mere saat putron ko nadi main baha diya kintu apni pratigya ke anusaar maine kuch na kaha
 Now you are going to shed this eighth son of mine too
 main tumse prarthana karata hoon ki krupa karke ise nadi main mat bahaao
 On hearing this, Ganga said, "rajan! You have broken your vow so i can no longer be with you
 " itnaa kah kar ganga apane putr ke saath antardhyaan ho gayi
 After that Maharaj Shantanu spent thirty-six years wearing a Brahmacharya fast
 phir ek din unhone ganga ke kinare ja kar ganga se kaha, "gange! aaj meri ichha us balak ko dekhne kii ho rahi he jise tum apane saath le gai thim
 "ganga appeared as a beautiful woman with that child and said," Rajan! This is your son and its name is Devavrata, take it
 yah parakramee hone ke saath vidwaan bhi hoga
 In astrology it will be similar to Parashurama
 " maharaj shantanu apane putr devvrat ko paakar atyant prasann huye or use apane saath hastinapur laakar yuvaraj ghoshit kar diya
 One day Maharaj Shantanu was roaming on the banks of Yamuna that he saw a beautiful girl riding a boat in the river
 uske ang ang se sugandh nikal rahi thi
 Maharaj asked the girl, "oh God! Who are you?" The girl told, "maharaj! My name is Satyavati and i am a Nishad girl
 " maharaj uske rup yauvan par riz kar tatkaal uske pita ke paas pahunche or satyavati ke saath apane vivaah kaa prastaav kiya
 On this Dhinwar said, "rajan! i have no objection to my daughter marrying you, but you must make the son born of my daughter's womb the heir to your kingdom
" 
 "on hearing these words of Nishad, Maharaj Shantanu returned quietly to Hastinapur
 satyavati ke viyog main maharaj shantanu vyakul rahane lage
 His body became weaker day by day
 maharaj kii is dasha ko dekh kar devvrat ko badi chintaa hui
 When he came to know the reason of this type of father's condition by the ministers, he immediately went to Nishad's house with all the ministers and he said to Nishad, "O Nishad! You are happily married your daughter Satyavati to my father Shantanu
 Please do it
 main aapako vachan detaa hoon ki aapaki putree ke garbh se jo balak janm legaa vahi rajya kaa uttaradhikari hoga
 In the long run, if any of my children do not take away the rights of your daughter's children, i pledge that i will remain unmarried for a lifetime
 " unki is pratigya ko sun kar nishad ne haath jod kar kaha, "he devvrat! aapaki yah pratigya abhootpurv he
 "having said this, Nishad immediately sent his daughter Satyavati along with Devavrata and his ministers to Hastinapur

 Diatoms are found in water and by looking at the place, different types of diatom colonies are found, so that we can easily find the crime scene
 dytome vividh prakaar ke sooksham shaiwal hai jo kii silica cell kii diwaar se bane hote hai
 Diatoms have many characteristics such as color, shape, etc
 dytome kii lagbhag 8000 jatiyaan hai
 The caste of each diatom is identified by the variety of silica found in them, which varies according to the environment
 jab yah sookshm shaiwal marate hai to inkaa frustule pani talachat bana detaa he
 With the help of this Frustule, we get to know the species of diatom, which also leads to the crime scene
 kisi bhi vyakti kii mrityu pani main doobane se hui he yaa nahin, iskaa pataa dytome ke pareekshan se chalata he
 The silica layer on the diatom is unaffected by acids and is readily found in all types of water
 jab koi jivit vyakti pani main duubataa he to saans lene ke saath pani fefdo main chalaa jaataa he or uske saath-saath pani main paae jane vaale dytome bhi us vyakti ke fefdon main chale jate hai
 With the flow of blood, these diatoms reach different parts of the body
 agar kisi bhi vyakti ke sharir ke vibhinn angon main dytome paae jate hai to ham kah sakate hai ki pani main doobane se pehle vyakti jivit tha
 Whereas if a person is thrown into water after death, then the presence of diatom is highest in the bones of the thigh and legs only
 dytome ke in pareekshanon kii madad se ham yah pataa laga sakate hai ki vyakti kii mrityu pani main doobane se hui he yaa phir mrit sharir ko pani main duboya gaya tha
 The time of death can also be detected by a diatom test
 jaise agar dytome pareekshan ke baad dytome kii colony kii jatiyaan 20 se kam hai to kah sakate hai ki mrityu ko kam se kam 7-12 din hue hai
 If the diatom species is more than 50, then in that case the death of the person is considered to be about 1 week

 Many Buddhist monks settled in Tibet from this university
 san 67 isvi main chini samraat ke nimantran par sabase pehle jo do bhartiya acharya china gaye unke naam he-kaashyap maantag or dharmarakshit

 Khalifa Harun al-rashid was the ruler of Baghdad from 786 AD to 809 AD
 udhaaharan ke taur par sushrutsamhita kaa anuwaad arabi main ek bhartiya ne kiya jise 'mankh' kaha jaataa he
 Apart from texts like astronomy, astrology, mathematics and medicine, the Arabs also praised Indian texts of various disciplines as well as various subjects of Indian civilization-culture

 Seeds and sweet fruits are often not called vegetables
 khaae jane vaale pattey, tane, danthal or jaden praayah sabji kahi jaati hai
 Culturally, the definition of 'vegetable' varies according to local practice
 udhaaharan ke liye bahut se log kukuramutton ko sabzi maanate hai jabaki anya logon ke anusaar yah sabzi nahin balki ek anya khaane kii shrenee he

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavadgita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
