 The biggest reason for this is the interest of Delhiites towards food
 dilli bharat kaa dil he isliye bharat ke har hisse ke lajij vyanjan yahaan sulabh hai
 But this hobby of Delhiites is not limited to Punjabi, Gujarati or South Indian
 unhen tarah-tarah ke khaane kaa itnaa shauk he ki duniyabar kii international food chence ko dilli ek bade bazaar ke rup main najar aa rahaa he
 Chinese, Continental, Mexican and Italian food are now found in almost every part of Delhi

 Due to the use of coconut and chilli, Thai food is very similar to South Indian food

 However, it is very spicy and contains a lot of calories
 chinis se kaaphi samanta rakhane vaale is food main mirch-masaalon kaa istemaal kam hota he
 For example, boiled rice, pickles, soups, vegetables and fish are eaten in a typical Japanese home
 dilli ke liye yah khaanaa abhi nayaa he, lekin bhartiya khaane se kaaphi miltaa julata he
 The main use of dry fruits in this is its special feature
 china hi nahin, food ke jariye dilli duniya ke kai duusare deshon ke bhi kareeb ai he
 The result of this close is that Delhi is also full of specialty restaurants
 al arab, dam pukht, kashmiri food ke liye chor bijair, thai food ke liye baan thai or sukothai, jaipanij food ke liye tokio, mexican food ke liye rodeo 


 list lambii he
 Overall, today Delhiites have adopted global food culture in the true sense by dropping every wall of regionalism in terms of food and drink

 bhartiya itihaas ke pracheen yug main uttar bharat main jab bhi samrajya sthapit hue, avanti praaia: unka ek praant rahaa
 Dashpur used to fall in it and sometimes there was a unit of governance there
 uskaa koi moolyawaan aitihaasik ullekh guptyuga ke pehle kaa nahin miltaa
 Kumaragupta i and II and Bandhuvarma's Vatsabhatti dated 436 AD and 472 AD have been found in Mandsaur, from which it is known that when Bandhuvarma Kumaragupta i was represented in Daspur, the fibers there constructed a sunyamandir and its expenditure
 Arranged 36 varshon baad hi us mandir ke punarudwar kii aavashyaktaa hui or vah kumargupta dwitiya ke samay sampann hua
 Bandhuvarma probably remained the regional ruler of the Guptasamritas in Daspur during this period
 thode dinon baad hunon ne uske saare parshvavarti pradeshon ko rond daalaa or gupton kaa shashan vahaan se samaapt ho gaya
 From the coins of Mihirkul found in Gwalior, it appears that the territory of Dashpur went under the authority of the Huns
 kintu unki safalataa sthaayee na thi or yashodharman vishnuvardhan naamak oulikarvanshi ek navdith raja ne mihirkul ko parrast kiya
 From Mandsaur, an inscription of Vashul of Yashodharma dated VI 589 has been found in which he is given the titles of Janendra, Naradhipati, Samrat, Rajadhiraj, Parameshwara Upadhi
 uskaa yah bhi daawa he ki jin pradeshon ko gupt samrat bhi nahin bhoga sake, un sabko usne jeeta or neech mihirkul ko vivash hokar pushpamalaon se yukt apane sir ko uske donon pairon par rakhkar uski puja kerani padi
 Yashodharma reached Uttar Pradesh via Madhya Bharat and trampled the entire Gupta empire, destroying the power of Mihirkul in Punjab
 purv main lauhitya se prarambh kar himalay kii chotiyon ko choote hue pashchim payodhi tak tathaa dakshin-purv se mahendra parvat tak ke saare kshetra ko swytt karne kaa usne daawa kiya he

 is rog se grasit rogi kii manodasha baari-baari se do vipareet avasthaaon main jaati rahati he
 One mood is called fad or mania and the other mood is depression
 sanak kii manodasha main rogi ati-ashaavadi ho saktaa he; apane bare me badi-chadhi dharna rakh saktaa he ; vyakti ati-kriyasheel ho saktaa he ; rogi sona nahin chahta yaa sone ko anaavashyak kahata he aadi
 On the other hand, in a mood of depression, the patient remains depressed; He feels tired; Feels guilty or lacks hope
 aise vyakti kaa mood jaldi-jaldi badalata he
 Whenever he feels absolutely happy, he suddenly reaches a state of depression
 khushi or dukh donon hi avasthaaen saamaanya nahin hoti he
 This state of happiness is called menic
 dridhruvi vikaar ko mukhyat: teen shreniyon main baanta gaya he- This disorder affects both men and women
 chunki yah mastishk ke prakaayon ko prabhavit karata he jisase iskaa prabhaav logon ke sochane, vyavhaar or mahasoos karne main dekha aata he
 This makes it difficult for other people to understand their situation
 saamanyat: vayaskon main ye sthiti ek hafte se lekar, ek maheene tak rahati he
 In many cases it may be less than this
 menic or depressant kii sthiti aniyamit hoti he or iskaa saathi bhi samaan nahin hota
 That is, its symptoms are not always the same
 har vyakti ke vyaktvi ke anusaar ye alag-alag prakat hote hai
 Some people get addicted to drugs and alcohol because of the flu disorder
 isse grasit logon ke liye madiraa or drugs behad hanikaarak siddh hote hai or vah vyakti kii sthiti ko zyada kharaab kar dete he jisase chikitsak ke liye uskaa upachaar karnaa adhik mushkil ho jaataa he
 No universally accepted scientific solution of Dridruvi mood disorder has been revealed so far
 zyaadaatar vaigyanik iske liye jaivaracinic, anuvaanshik or vaataavaran ko uttaradaayi maanate hai
 This is due to imbalance in brain chemicals
 snayusanchari main asantulan kii vajah se mood ko niyantrit karne vaala system gadabada jaataa he
 At the same time, genes are also major factors for this
 yadi kisi ke sage sambandhi ko dridhruvi vikaar he to us vyakti ko iske hone kii sambhaavna kaaphi had tak bad jaati he
 It should also not be interpreted that it will happen to him as well
 vahiin maahaul ko bhi manovaigyanik is vikaarake liye uttaradaayi maanate he
 Due to death of a person in the family, divorce of parents and many other traumatic accidents, the person becomes a victim
 mastishk kii sanrachana main kharabi ke kaaran bhi ye vikaar hota he
 Some studies have shown that such a problem occurs because of disturbances in the mandula, prefrontal cartex, and hippocampus
 dridhruvi mood vikarako pahchaan kar iskaa upachaar kiya ja saktaa he
 It is not very difficult to detect the symptoms of this disorder in adults
 bacchon or tinagers main iske lakshan vayaskon kii tarah nahin hote hai, aise main inamen lakshan pahchaanane main samasya aati he
 The current and past experiences of tngers are examined before treatment
 iske alaava parivaar ke sadsy or doston se bhi vyakti ke vyavhaar ke bare main jaankaree lee jaati he
 It is sometimes considered in teenagers as post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which makes it difficult to treat
 upachaar mukhyat: vyavhaarik lakshanon or sanketon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Tests are done later
 jaise siti scan brain bentricells kaa bada rup dikhaata he
 The same bright spot can be seen by MRI of the brain mishigan vishvavidhyalay main hue ek adhyayan main saamne aayaa ki dridhruvi mood vikaarawale logon main rasayan kaa snav karne vaali dimagi koshikaon kii sankhya aam logon kii tulana main 30 pratishat zyada hoti he
 In addition, they have an excess of calcium or cortisol in their brain

 Noyle Ewart Audel was a British geologist and mountaineer
 aaj ke samay main tanaav logon ke liye bahut hi saamaanya anubhav ban chukaa he, jo ki adhisankhya daihik or manovaigyanik pratikriyaaon dwaara vyakt hota he
 The traditional definition of stress focuses on the somatic response
 hens style ne 'tanaav' shabd ko khoja or isaki paribhaasha sharir kii kisi bhi aavashyaktaa ke aadhaar par anishchit pratikriya ke rup main kii
 The definition of Hans Shale's base is somatic and gives greater importance to the actions of hormones, which are secreted by the adrenals and other glands
 style ne do prakaar ke tanaavon kii sankalpana kii- The new approach to stress focuses on the role of evaluating and explaining the situation in relation to the adjustment resources available to the individual
 moolyankan or samaayojan kii anyonyashrith prakriyaayen vyakti ke vaataavaran evam uske anukulan ke bich sambandh nirdhaaran karti he
 Adaptation is the process by which an individual arranges the conditions and environment around him to maintain optimal levels of somatic, psychological and social interest
 vaataavaran kii koi ghatana yaa koi baat jo tanaav utpann kar sakati he use 'tanaav kaa kaarak' kaha jaataa he jaise bahut zyada kaarybhaar, bukamp se hui tabaahi ityadi
 Stress factors can be broadly organized into the following classes
 tanaav ke karkon ke prati hamaari pratikriyaaon ko nune samvednaa se lekar gambheer vyavhaaraatmak parivartanon kii vyapak shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 These responses are categorized into the following sections: - jab koi vyakti apane lakshya ko praapt karne main rukaawaton kaa saamana karata he to vah tanavagrast ho jaataa he
 This often creates feelings of duality and despair in the person
 prabal niraashaa milane ke kaaran yah dwandv or bhi tanaavpurn ho jaataa he
 Usually, a person falls in conflict when he encounters a conflicting situation
 uddeshy or paristhiti ke swaroop par nirbhar vyakti jivan main teen prakaar ke dvandvon kaa saamana karata he
 Proposition-proposal duality: This type of conflict arises when a person has to choose between two or more desired objectives
 is tarah ke dwandv main donon hi lakshyon kii prapti kii chahat hoti he
 For example, choosing one of two wedding invitations on the same day
 parihaar-prastaav dwandv : is tarah kaa dwandv tab utpann hota he jab kisi vyakti ko do yaa adhik avaanchit lakshyon main chunaav karnaa padataa he
 Such a duality is often called a 'well on one side and a ditch on the other' position
 jaise ki kam shaikshik yogyata vaale yuva ko yaa to berogari kaa saamana karnaa padegaa yaa phir bahut hi kam aay kii anchaahi naukari ko sweekaar karnaa padegaa
 Such a duality creates very serious harmony problems, because even resolving duality will produce frustration rather than peace
 prastaav-parihaar dwandv : is tarah ke dwandv main kisi vyakti main samaan uddeshy kaa chunaav karne evam use nakaarne donon ke prati prabal rujhaan hota he
 Just as a youth wants to get married due to social and security reasons but in the same situation he also fears that the responsibilities of marriage and personal freedom will end
 aise dwandv kaa samaadhaan lakshya ke kuch nakraatmak or sakaraatmak pahaluon ko sweekrut karne se hi sambhav he
 The multiple-choice duality is sometimes seen in the context of "mixed-grace" duality due to the majority of choices
 kuntha : kuntha ek prayogtmak avasthaa he jo ki kuch kaarnon ke parinamswaroop hoti he jaise Obstacles and barriers can be both physical and social and they cause frustration or frustration in the person
 is main durghatana, aswasth antarvaiyaktik sambandh, priy kii mrityu ho janaa
 Personal characteristics such as physical disability, incomplete ability and lack of self-discipline are also the root of frustration
 kuch saadhaaran kunthaayen hai jo aksar kuch nishchit mushkilon kaa kaaran ban jaati he
 These include delay in achievement of desired goals, lack of resources, failure, loss, loneliness and futility
 gasharabrum 5 karakoram ke gasharabrum punjak main sthit ek chotii he

 Ayurveda is one of the oldest medical systems in the world
 yah vigyaan, kala or darshan kaa mishran he
 The name 'ayurveda' means 'knowledge of life' and that is the essence of Ayurveda in a nutshell
 "ayurveda " shabd do shabdon se milakar bana he - "aayush" or "veda"
 , Ahit Age, Happiness Age, and Grief Age - they should be described as Ayurveda
 ) Ayurveda is Indian medicine
 ayurvigyaan, vigyaan kii vah shakha he jiskaa sambandh maanav sharir ko nirog rakhane, rog ho jane par rog se mukt karne athwa uskaa shaman karne tathaa aayu badhaane se he
 Ayurveda is the literature existing in the world, after which we can analyze our own lifestyle
 is shaastra ke aadi acharya ashvinikumar maane jate hai jinhone daksh prajapati ke dhad main bakre kaa sir joda tha
 Indra acquired this knowledge from Ashwini Kumar
 indra ne dhanvantari ko sikhaaya
 King of Kashi, Divodas is said to be the incarnation of Dhanvantari
 unase jaakar sushrut ne ayurveda padhaa
 Atri and Bharadwaj are also considered to be the promoters of this scripture
 apurveda ke acharya ye hai— ashvinikumar, dhanvantari, divodas, nakul, sahadev, arki, chyavan, janak, budh, jawal, jajali, pel, karath, agastya, atri tathaa unke chah shishy, sushrut or charak
 Brahma divided Ayurveda into eight parts and named each part 'tantra'
 ye aath bhaag nimnlikhit hai : Under this Ashtanga Ayurveda, there are also the elements of the body, physiology, armaments, pharmaceuticals and matter properties, medical elements and science
 iske atirikt usamen sadrush chikitsa, virdohi chikitsa or jalchikitsa aadi aajkal ke abhinav chikitsa pranaaliyon ke vidhaan bhi paye jate hai 
 According to archaeologists, the ancient book of the world is Rigveda
 vibhinn vidwaanon ne iskaa rachana kaal isa ke 3,000 se 50,000 varsh purv tak kaa mana he
 Even in this Samhita, the principles of the great importance of Ayurveda are disseminated here
 charak, sushrut, kaashyap aadi maanya granth ayurveda ko atharvaveda kaa upved maanate hai
 This proves the antiquity of Ayurveda
 atah ham kah sakate hai ki ayurveda kii rachanakaal isa purv 3,000 se 50,000 varsh pehle yani sristi kii utpatti ke aas-paas yaa saath kaa hi he
 In the context of historical knowledge of Ayurveda, the first mention of knowledge, according to Charaka, is the mention of Agnivesh - with the descent of Ayurveda in the death of the dead
 sarvapratham brahma se prajapati ne, prajapati se ashvini kumaron ne, unase indra ne or indra se bharadwaj ne ayurveda kaa adhyayan kiya
 The tenure of Chyavan Rishi has also been considered a contemporary of Ashwini Kumars
 ayurveda ke vikaas main rishi chyavan kaa atimahatvapurn yogadan he
 Then Bharadwaj got a long happy and healthy life under the influence of Ayurveda and propagated it among other sages
 tadnantar punarvasu aatreya ne agnivesh, bhel, jatu, parashar, harit or ksharpani naamak chah shishyon ko ayurveda kaa upadesh diya
 The most intelligent of these six disciples, Agnivesh first created a Samhita - the Agnivesh Tantra which was later re-invented by Charaka and named it Charaksamhita, which is the foundation pillar of Ayurveda
 sushrut ke anusaar kashiraj divodas ke rup main avatarit bhagwaan dhanvantari ke paas anya maharshiryon ke saath sushrut jab ayurveda kaa adhyayan karne hetu gayi or unase aavedan kiya
 At that time, Lord Dhanvantari preached to them that Brahma himself first published the Upveda Ayurveda of Atharvaveda in a thousand chapters - Shata Sahasra Shlokas before the creation of the universe and then divided it into eight organs by considering the human being as short-sighted
 is prakaar dhanvantari ne bhi ayurveda kaa prakaashan brahmadev dwaara hi pratipaadit kiya hua mana he
 Lord Dhanvantari again said that Daksha Prajapati from Brahma, Ashvinikumar Dwya from him and Indra studied Ayurveda from him
 ayurveda ke itihaas ko mukhyatya teen bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he - The time of the Code was in the 5th century BC
 It is believed to be from the 6th century
 yah kaal ayurveda kii moulik rachanaaon kaa yug tha
 At this time, Acharyo, on the strength of his talent and experience, practiced his erudite texts about different organs
 ayurveda ke trimuni - charak, sushrut or vagbhat, ke udai kaa kaal bhi samhitakaal hi he
 The amazing success in the field of karyotherapy through Charaka Samhita Granth is a major feature of this period
 iskaa samay 7veen shatee se lekar 15veen shatee tak mana gaya he tathaa yah kaal aalochanaon evam tikaakaron ke liye janaa jaataa he
 In this period, commentators on the compositions of the Samhidakala formulated mature and healthy interpretations
 is samay ke acharya dalhan kii sushrut samhita tikaa ayurveda jagat main ati mahatvapurn maani jaati he
 The research text 'rasaratnasamuchaya' is also a composition of this period, which has been written by Acharya Vagbhat based on Charaka and Sushruta Samhita and the composition of many rasastriyas
 is kaal kaa samay 14veen shatee se lekar aadhunik kaal tak mana jaataa he
 This period has been the period of writings of texts on specific subjects
 madhavnidan, jverdarpan aadi granth bhi isi kaal main likhe gayi
 Special attention was also paid to various forms of medicine in this period, which is relevant even in the present day
 is kaal main ayurveda kaa vistaar evam prayog bahut bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 It is clear that the antiquity of Ayurveda has been proved since the Vedas
 aadhunik chikitsapaddati main saamaajik chikitsa paddati ko ek nai vichaardhara mana jaataa he, parantu yah koi nai vichaardhaara nahin apitu yah uski punrariti maatr he, jiskaa ullekh 2500 varshon se bhi pehle ayurveda main kiya gaya he
 The aim of Ayurveda is to protect the health of healthy animals and protect the patient from disease
 
 Ayurveda has two objectives: iske liye apane sharir or prakruti ke anukool desh, kaal aadi kaa vichaar karnaa niyamit aahaar-vihaar, cheshtaa, vyaayaam, shouch, snaan, shayan, jaagran aadi grihasth jivan ke liye upyogi shastrokt dincharya, ratricharya evam ritucharya kaa paalan karnaa, sankatmay kaaryon se bachanaa, prayek kaary vivekpurvak karnaa, man or indriya ko niyantrit rakhana, desh, kaal aadi paristhitiyon ke anusaar apane apane sharir aadi kii shakti or ashakti kaa vichaar kar koi kaary karnaa, mel, mutr aadi ke upasthit vegon ko na rokna, irshyaa, dwesh, lobh, ahankaar aadi se bachanaa, samay-samay par sharir main sanchit dosha ko nikaalane ke liye vaman, virechan aadi ke prayogon se sharir kii shuddhi karnaa, sadachaar kaa paalan karnaa or dooshit vaayu, jal, desh or kaal ke prabhaav se utpann mahamariyon main vijna chikitsakon ke upadeshon kaa samuchit rup se paalan karnaa, svachh or vishodhit jal, vaayu, aahaar aadi kaa seven karnaa or dusron ko bhi iske liye prerit karnaa, ye swasthyaraksha ke saadhan hai
 For each disease ye teenon ayurveda ke 'triskandh' kehalaati hai
 It is detailed in Ayurveda texts
 yahan keval sankshipt parichay maatr diya jayega
 But before that, a brief introduction of each ingredient is necessary, because without the knowledge of the components it will not be possible to know the disorders that occur in them
 ayurveda kaa arth pracheen aacharyon kii vyakhya or isamen aae hue 'aayu' or 'veda' in do shabdon ke arthon ke anusaar bahut vyapak he
 The Acharyas of Ayurveda have called the 'combination of body, sense, mind and soul' as age
 arthath jab tak in chaaron sampatti yaa vipatti ke anusaar aayu ke anek bhed hote hai, kintu sankshep main prabhaavbhed se ise chaar prakaar kaa mana gaya he : Sukhayu: a person rich in knowledge, science, force, strength, wealth, wealth, fame, family, etc
, being devoid of any kind of physical or mental development, is called "sukhayu"
 dukhaayu : iske vipareet samast sadhano se yukt hote hue bhi, shareerik yaa maansik rog se peedit athwa nirog hote hue bhi saadhanheen yaa swasthya or saadhan donon se hin vyakti ko "du:khaayu' kehete hai
 Hitayu: a person who possesses qualities like prudence, virtue, gentleness, generosity, truth, non-violence, peace, benevolence, etc
, while being full of health and resources or lacking in them, and continues in the welfare of society and the people
 He is called Hitayu
 ahitayu : iske vipareet jo vyakti avivek, duraachaar, krurta, swaarth, dambh, atyaachaar aadi durgunon se yukt or samaaj tathaa lok ke liye abhishaap hote hai unhen ahitayu kehete hai
 Thus, there are four distinctions of interest, harm, happiness and grief
 isi prakaar kalpramaan ke anusaar bhi dderghaayu, madhyaayu or alpaayu, sankshep main ye teen bhed hote hai
 By the way, many distinctions can also be imagined in these three
 'veda' shabd ke bhi satta, laabh, gati, vichaar, prapti or gyaan ke saadhan, ye arth hote hai or aayu ke veda ko ayurveda kehete hai
 That is, the scripture in which the nature of age, the various distinctions of age, beneficial and disrespectful to age and the means of their knowledge and the corporeal body of age, sense, mind and soul, with the development of all or any of these interests, pleasures and Ayurveda is considered to be a means of achieving the means of achieving longevity and measures to solve their obstructive issues
 kintu aajkal ayurveda "pracheen bhartiya chikitsapaddati' is sankuchit arth main prayukt hota he
 The basic five physical bodies of all efforts, senses, mind and soul are called 'bodies'
 maanav sharir ke sthool rup main chah ang hai; do haath, do pair, shir or greeva ek tathaa antradhi ek
 The components of these organs are called suffixes- ayurveda ke anusaar saare sharir main 300 asthiyaan hai, jinhen aajkal keval gananaa-kram-bhed ke kaaran do sau chah maanate hai tathaa sandhiyaan 200, snaayu 900, shirayein 700, dhamniyaan 24 or unki shakhaaen 200, peshiyaan 500 tathaa sookshm strot 30,956 hai
 According to Ayurveda, the seven metals are juice, blood, meat, fattening, bone, marrow and Venus
 nityprati swaabhaavat: vividh kaaryon main upyog hone se inkaa kshay bhi hota rahata he, kintu bhojan or paan ke rup main ham jo vividh padaarth lete rahete hai unase na keval is kshati kii purti hoti he, varan dhaatuon kii pushti bhi hoti rahati he
 The food taken in the form of food matures by pachcagni, geotropic and various metals and after many changes, it turns into the aforesaid metals and nourishes these metals
 is pachankriya main aahaar kaa jo saar bhaag hota he usase ras dhaatu kaa poshan hota he or jo kitt bhaag bachataa he usase mel or mutr banataa he
 This juice reaches the whole body through the veins through the heart and provides nutrition to every metal and organ
 dhaatvagniyon se pachan hone par ras aadi dhaatu ke saar bhaag se rakt aadi dhaatuon evam sharir kaa bhi poshan hota he tathaa kitt bhaag se malon kii utpatti hoti he, jaise ras se kaph; rakt pitt; maance se naak, kaan or netra aadi ke dwaara baahar aanevaale mel; med se swead ; asthi se kesh tathaa lom or majja se aankh kaa keechad malaroop main banate hai
 Venus has no stool, oozes are produced from all its parts
 inhen rasadi dhaatuon se anek upadhaatuon kii bhi utpatti hoti he, yatha ras se doodh, rakt se conderaayein or shirayen, maance se vasa, twachaa or uske chah yaa saat str, med se snaayu, asthi se daant, majja se kesh or shukr se oj naamak upadhaatuon kii utpatti hoti he
 These metals and substrates are useful in different body functions by being located in different forms in different components
 jab tak ye uchit pariman or swaroop main rahati hai or inaki kriya swaabhaavik rahati he tab tak sharir swasth rahata he or jab ye nune yaa adhik maatra main tathaa vikrut swaroop main hoti hai to sharir main rog kii utpatti hoti he
 According to the ancient philosophical theory, all the gross matter of the world, earth, water, light, air and sky are formed by the combination of these five elements
 inke anupaat main bhed hone se hi unke bhinn-bhinn rup hote hai
 Similarly, all the metals, substrates and feces of the body are five physical
 parinamat: sharir ke samast avyav or atat: sara sharir paanchabhautik he
 These are all unconscious
 jab inamen aatma kaa sanyog hota he tab uski chetanta main inamen bhi chetana aati he
 The body starts in the mother's uterus due to the combination of pure raja and pure semen under proper conditions and the infusion of the soul in it
 ise hi garbh kehete hai
 The fetus receives nutrition from the dietary blood of the mother through the placenta and the womb, which is attached to the navel
 yah garbhodak main nimagn rahakar upasnehan dwaara bhi poshan praapt karata he tathaa pratham maas main kalal or dwitiya main ghan hota he? tisare maas main ang pratyang kaa vikaas aarambh hota he
 In the fourth month, it becomes more stable and the signs of pregnancy start to appear clearly in the mother
 is prakaar yah mata kii kukshi main uttarottar viksit hota hua jab sampurna ang, pratyang or avyavon se yukt ho jaataa he, tab praaia: nawein maas main kukshi se baahar aakar naveen praani ke rup main janm grahan karata he
 Each organ or any component in the body is formed with the purpose, that is, the accomplishment of specific functions by each element, such as holding with hands, walking with feet, eating with mouth, chewing with teeth etc
 kuch avyav aise bhi hai jinase kai kaary hote hai or kuch aise hai jinase ek vishesh kaary hi hota he
 Among those who have a particular work, there is a specific subtle structure that is empowered for that work
 isi ko indriya kehete hai
 In order to gain knowledge of these external subjects, words, touch, form, juice and smell, these components are called sensory organs, respectively, ear, skin, eye, tongue and nasal and the specific powerful subtle object in them is called sense
 ye kramash: paanch hai- Among these subtle elements, among the panchamabhutas is the characteristic of the mahabhut whose words etc
 have special properties; Such as the sky in the srotra sense for the word, the air in the sensory sense for touch, the sharp in the sensory sense for the form, the earth in the sun for the juice and the earth element in the olfactory for smell
 in paanchon indriyon ko gyanendriya kehete hai
 In addition to these, there are five concentrates for specific performance, such as legs for movement, hands for eclipse, lingua for speaking, anus and urethra for excretion and penis for childbirth
 ayurveda darshanikon kii bhanti indriyon ko aahankaarik nahin, apitu bhautik maanata he
 These senses have a tendency to be inspired by their actions
 man se sampark na hone par ye niskriy rahati he
 Every creature has a very subtle body and only one mind
 yah atyant drutagati vaala or prayek indriya kaa niyantrak hota he
 But it itself remains inactive by being unconscious without contact with the soul
 prayek vyakti ke man main satv, raj or tam, ye teenon prakritik gun hote hue bhi inamen se kisi ek kii saamanyat: prabalata rahati he or usee ke anusaar vyakti satvik, rajas yaa taamas hota he, kintu samay-samay par aahaar, aachaar evam paristhitiyon ke prabhaav se dasre gunon kaa bhi prabalya ho jaataa he
 Its knowledge is through the signs of instincts, such as raga-malice - zero realist mind is satvic, ragya, conscious and playful mind is Rajas and the mind is tamas with laziness, longevity and inactivity
 isiilie satvik man ko shuddh, satv yaa prakritik mana jaataa he or raj tathaa tam uske dosha kahe gaye hai
 By attaining consciousness from the soul, the natural or sad mind induces the senses in their respective subjects according to their qualities and according to that the bodily functions are done accordingly
 aatma man ke dwaara hi indriyon or shariravayavon ko pravrutt karata he, kyonki man hi uskaa karan he
 That is why knowledge comes from the senses with which the mind interacts, not through another
 kyonki man ek ore sookshm hota he, at: ek saath uskaa anek indriyon ke saath sampark sabhav nahin he
 Yet his pace is so rapid that he quickly changes in contact with the other senses, so that we know that he is in contact with everyone and all things are happening simultaneously, but not really Happen
 aatma panchmahabhoot or man se bhinn, chetanavan, nirvikaar or nity he tathaa sakshi swaroop he, kyonki swayan nirvikaar tathaa niskriy he
 It interacts with the active but unconscious mind, senses and body, and they are conscious
 aatma main rup, rang, akruti aadi koi chihn nahin he, kintu uske bina sharir achetan hone ke kaaran nishcesht padaa rahata he or mrit kahalata he tathaa uske sampark se hi usamen chetana aati he tab use jivit kaha jaataa he or usamen anek swaabhaavik kriyaayein hone lagati hai; jaise shwasochvas, chote se bada hona or kate hue ghaav bharna aadi, palkon kaa khulanaa or band hona, jivan ke lakshan, man kii gati, ek indriya se hue gyaan kaa duusari indriya par prabhaav hona, vibhinn indriyon or avyavon ko vibhann kaaryon main pravrutt karnaa, vishyon kaa grahan or dhaaran karnaa, swapn main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak pahunchnaa, ek aankh se dekhi vastu kaa duusari aankh se bhi anubhav karnaa
 Desire, malice, happiness, sorrow, effort, patience, intelligence, memory, ego, etc
 are only when the soul is in the body; Selfless people are not in dead bodies
 at: ye aatma ke lakshan kahe jate hai, arthath aatma kaa purvokt lakshanon se anumaan maatr kiya ja saktaa he
 It is not possible to direct it from any other senses other than mental imagination
 yah aatma nity, nirvikaar or vyapak hote hue bhi purvakrit shubh yaa ashubh karm ke parinamswaroop jaisi yoni main yaa sharir main, jis prakaar ke man or indriyon tathaa vishyon ke sampark main aati he vaise hi kaary hote hai
 Progressively inauspicious actions leads to downward progress and progress is progressively by auspicious deeds, salvation is attained when the mind is raga-malice-inferior
 is vivaran se spasht ho jaataa he ki aatma to nirvikaar he, kintu man, indriya or sharir main vikruti ho sakati he or in teenon ke paraspar saapekshya hone ke kaaran ek kaa vikaar duusare ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to keep them in a state of nature or deformed or brought into nature
 isse deergh sukh or hitayu kii prapti hoti he, jisase kramash: aatma ko bhi uske ekmaatr, kintu bheeshan, janm mrityu or bhavabandhanrup rog se mukti paane main sahaayta milti he, jo ayurveda main naitishthaki chikitsa kahi gai he
 Charaka has briefly written the symptoms of disease and healing- sushrut ne swasth vyakti kaa lakshan vistaar se diya he- If the symptoms are contrary, it should be considered unhealthy
 rog ko vikruti yaa vikaar bhi kehete hai
 Therefore, malformations in the natural form or action of body, senses and mind are diseases
 rog ke kaaran ko 'nidaan' yah paryaayi shabd aayaa he
 When a diet or vihara shows the disease on the body, then it is called diagnosis
 sansar kii sabhi vastuen saakshaat yaa parampara se sharir, indriyon or man par kisi na kisi prakaar kaa nishchit prabhaav daalati hai or anuchit yaa pratikul prabhaav se inamen vikaar utpann kar rogon kaa kaaran hoti hai
 Detailed discussion of all these is difficult, so in a nutshell they are divided into three sections: pragyaparaadh : avivek, adheeratha tathaa purv anubhav or vaastaviktaa kii upeksha ke kaaran laabh haani kaa vichaar kiye bina hi kisi vishay kaa seven yaa jaanate hue bhi anuchit vastu kaa seven karnaa
 This is also called inferior, false and excessive yoga of karma in other and clearer terms
 asatmyendriarsanyog : chakshu aadi indriyon kaa apane-apane rup aadi vishyon ke saath asatmya sanyog indriyon, sharir or man ke vikaar kaa kaaran hota he; yatha aankh se bilkul na dekhnaa, ati tejasvi vastuon kaa dekhnaa or bahut adhik dekhnaa tathaa atisookshm, sankeern, ati dur main sthit tathaa bhayanak, bibhats, evam vikrutrup vastuon ko dekhnaa 
 They also cause disorder in the mind and body along with the eye and its innate eyes
 isi ko duusare shabdon main arth kaa duryog bhi kehete hai
 Rituals like summer, rain, cold etc
 and childhood, youth and old age also have an effect on the body, etc
, but their inferiority, falsehood and non-use effect are particularly harmful
 purvokt kaarnon ke prakarantar se anya bhed bhi hote hai; yatha In contrast, they have two other differences - sharir par in sabhi kaarnon ke teen prakaar ke prabhaav hote hai : Doshapakop - Changes in any one or many of the five elements, etc
, due to many factors, it is mandatory to change their natural proportions
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar ayurvedacharyon ne in vikaron ko vaat, pitt or kaph in virgon main vibhakt kiya he
 Panchamabhuta and Tridosha are considered separately, but in short it should be understood that all the tangible substances of the world are made up of these five elements, sky, air, light, water and earth
 ye prithvi aadi ve hi nahin he jo hamen nityprati sthool jagat main dekhne ko milte hai
 These last five are the five physics generated by the combination of the aforesaid elements
 vastuon main jin tatwon kii bahulata hoti he ve unheen naamon se varnit kii jaati hai
 In the same way, the elements of which we have a lot in our body metals or in their components are counted in the same category
 in paanchon main akaash to nirvikaar he tathaa prithvi sabase sthool or sabhi kaa aashray he
 Whatever development or change happens, it clearly has an impact on it
 shesh teen sab prakaar ke parivartan yaa vikaar utpann karne main samarth hote hai
 Therefore, depending on the abundance of the three, various metals and their constituents have been labeled Vata, Pitta and Kapha
 saamaanya rup se ye teenon dhaatuen sharir kii poshak hone ke kaaran vikrut hone par anya dhaatuon ko bhi dooshit karti hai
 Therefore, due to defects and feces, it is called mal
 rog main kisi bhi kaaran se inhen teenon kii nunata yaa adhikta hoti he, jise doshapracope kehete hai
 Metal pollution - There are some substances or causes that cause disorder in a particular metal or component
 inkaa prabhaav saare sharir par nahin hota
 These are called metal pollutants
 ubhayhetu- ve padaarth jo saare sharir main vaat aadi dosha ko kupit karte hue bhi kisi dhaatu yaa ang vishesh main hi vishesh vikaar utpann karte hai, ubhayhetu kehalaate hai
 But the changes which occur in these three, vata, pitta or kapha cause disorder in any one, two or three of these three
 at: ye hi teenon dosha pradhan sharirgat kaaran hote hai, kyonki inke swaabhaavik anupaat main parivartan hone se sharir kii dhaatuon aadi main bhi vikruti hoti he
 It is also natural to have a disorder in action due to a disorder in the composition 
 is aswabhaavik rachana or kriya ke parinamswaroop atisar, kaas aadi lakshan utpann hote hai or in lakshanon ke samooh ko hi rog kehete hai

 Sachchidananda Hiranand Vatsyayan Agnayya, a contemporary poet, was his best friend

 His writing style was descriptive, describing each psychological thinking of the character in a breathtaking manner
 paatro kaa charitra-nirmaan kaaphi teji se hota tha kyonki paatr ek saamaanya-saral maanav man ke atirikt or kuch nahin hota tha
 In almost every story, the thinking of the characters was dominated by events

 Renu was a wonderful anecdote and reading his works, it seems as if someone is telling a story

 His writings carry forward the social realist tradition of Premchand and he is also known as Premchand after independence

 He again became the emperor from 20 March to 22 June 1815
 vah europe ke anya kai kshetron kaa bhi shaasha tha
 Napoleon is counted among the greatest generals in the world in history
 usne ek france main ek nayi vidhi samhita lagu kii jise nepolian kii samhita kaha jaataa he
 He was one of the greatest winners of history
 uske saamne koi ruk nahin paa rahaa tha
 Until he invaded Russia in 1812, where his army was greatly damaged by the cold and the atmosphere
 18 june 1815 waterlu ke yuddh main paraajay ke pashchaat angrazon ne use andh mahaasaagar ke dur dweep saint helena main bandi bana diya
 He died there at the end of six years
 itihaaskaaron ke anusaar angrezon ne use sankhiya kaa vish dekar maar daalaa
 Napoleon was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajasi, the following year after the reunification of Carcica and France
 uske pita charles bonapart ek chirkaalin kuleen parivaar ke the
 Their lineage is said to be from the Tuscany region of Italy adjacent to Carcica
 charles bonapart french darbar main carsika kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 He was married to an aristocratic beauty named Leticia Remolino, who was born Napoleon
 charles ne french shashan ke viruddh carsican vidroh main bhaag bhi liya tha, kintu antat: french shakti se samya sthapit karnaa hi shreyaskar samajha
 By the grace of the French Governor Marbiff, he also had the opportunity to join a consultation in Versailles
 charles ke saath uski dwitiya putr napolian bhi tha
 Inspired by the bright future that his personality indicated, the French authorities offered Breen a scholarship to study at the military academy and received his education there from 1779 to 1784
 taduparant paris ke sainik skool main use apana topakhane sambandhi gyaan pusht karne kaa avasar lagbhag ek varsh tak mila
 Thus Napoleon's childhood was spent in the French environment
 balyavastha main hi saare parivaar ke bharan poshan kaa uttardaayitv komal kandhon par pad jane ke kaaran use vaataavaran kii jatilta evam uske anusaar vyavhaar karne kii kushalta mil gai thi
 Therefore, his entry into the French Revolution was indicative of epoch-making events
 france ke vibhinn virgon se sampark sthapit karne main use koi sankoch yaa hichkichaahat nahin thi
 He also entered the Jacobin contingent and was introduced to events directly on the occasion of Tuileri's right on 20 June
 france ke rajtantr kii durdasha kaa bhi use purna gyaan ho gaya tha
 This is where the huge personality of Napoleon emerges
 napolian ke udai tak french kranti purna araajaktaa main parivartit ho chuki thi
 The 'reign of terror' was conducted as a result of the rivalry and disharmony of the Jacobin and Girndist parties, in which all the revolutionaries, even Rabspier himself, were killed one by one
 1793 i main tulaan ke ghere main napolian ko pratham baar apana shaury evam kalapradarshan kaa avasar mila tha
 Bairas, a prominent ruler of the directory, was attracted by his talent
 phir 1795 main jab bheed kanrveshan ko hui thi, to directory dwaara vishesh rup se ayukta hone par napolian ne kushaltapurvak kanvension kii raksha kii or samvidhan ko hone diya
 These successes drew the attention of all France to Napoleon and the directory gave him the lead in the Italian campaign
 ek saptaah pashchaat usne jojephin se vivaah kiya or taduparant apni sena sahit italy main pravesh kiya
 The Italian campaign was a vivid example of Napoleon's military and administrative ability
 is baat kii ghoshnaa purv hi kar di gai thi ki french sena italy ko austria kii daastaa se mukt karaane aa gayi he
 He severed ties with Austria by defeating the enemy at the first three places
 tab sardenia ko yudhviram karne ke liye vivash kar diya
 He then received Milan in Lodi's place
 revoli ke yuddh main mentua ko samarpan karnaa padaa
 Archduke Charles also had to submit the treaty and the Luban agreement was reached
 in saare yudhon or vaartaon main napolian ne paris se kisi prakaar kaa aadesh nahin liya
 The Pope also had to make a treaty
 lombardi ko sisalpine tathaa jinoa ko ligurian ganatantr main parivartit kar french namoonay par ek vidhaan diya
 These successes caused Austria to lose its footing and had to turn to Napoleon for the Treaty of Campo Fermi, and in this complex situation, Austria had to withdraw its hand from its Bellary territories and from the Rhine frontiers and Lombardy
 napolian ke in yudhon se tathaa chote rajyon ko samaapt kar vrihat ikai main parivartit karne ke kaaryon se, italy main ek rashtriya andolan khadaa hua jo itihaas main risorgimento ke naam se prasiddh he
 On his return from the Italian expedition, Napoleon received a grand welcome
 directory bhi bhaybheet ho gai tathaa napolian ko france se dur rakhane kaa upaay sochane lagi
 At this time, the rival of France was left only to Britain
 napolian ne britain ko haraane ke liye uske samrajya par kutharaghaat na karnaa uchit samajha tathaa apni misr-abhiyaan-yojana rakhi
 The directory immediately accepted him
 1798 i main bonapart ne misr ke liye prasthaan kiya
 The plan of ending the eastern kingdom of Britain through Egypt instead of making a direct attack on Britain seemed compatible with the French rulers
 mimluk turki se iskaa saamana paramid ke tathakthith yuddh main hua
 But the Mediterranean president of the British Navy was chasing Commander Nelson Napoleon efficiently
 usne aage badhkar francisiyon ko nil nadi ke yuddh main teetar-bitar kar diya tathaa turki ko bhi englad kii ore se yuddh main pravesh karne ke liye vivash kar diya
 Nelson's success gave Britain the opportunity to form a second bloc, and the nations of Europe, which Napoleon had suppressed, began preparing for a campaign against France
 turki ke yuddh main pravisht ho jane par napolian ne syria kaa abhiyaan chhedaa
 With only a limited contingent of thirteen thousand marched towards Acker but stopped by a skilled fighter like Sidney Smith
 yah napolian ke liye vardaan siddh hua
 Now Napoleon was involved in the creation of another French empire in Syria
 kintu france is samay ek najuk sthiti se guzar rahaa tha
 Therefore, Napoleon considered it desirable to appear in France, despite being successful in establishing his power in Egypt
 napolian ke france main pravesh karte hi halchal paidaa ho gai
 Finding a favorable environment, in November 1799, Napoleon seized power and disbanded the directory and enacted a new legislation
 is vidhaan ke anusaar teen kaunsal niyukt hue
 After some time all the powers were concentrated in the first Council Napoleon
 france ek deergh ashaanti se thak chukaa tha tathaa kranti ko sthapitv kii ore le jane ke liye antarkalin shanti param aavashyak thi
 But before the peace was established, an Italian campaign was necessary to defeat Austria
 napolian ne 1800 i main italy kaa doosraa abhiyaan basant ritu main prarambh kiya tathaa merengo kii vijay praapt kar austria ko lunvil kii sandhi ke liye vivash kar diya, jisamen pehle kii campoformiyon kii sari sharten doharaai gai
 Now the second bloc broke out and Napoleon made a treaty of Amiens from England in 1801 AD, under which the two nations returned each other's conquered territories
 ab nepolian ne ek sudhaar yojana karyanvit kar france ko shashan or vyavastha di
 Disciplined the economic condition of France
 shiksha paddati main abhootpurv parivartan kiye
 Strengthened the land system
 paris kaa saundaryikaran kiya
 Made considerable changes in the army and gave a scientific basis to the French system, which is still known as the Napoleonic Code
 pope se ek con courdet kar catholic jagat kaa samarthan praapt kar liya
 Napoleon achieved considerable success with these reforms and in March 1804 he became the Emperor of France
 is ghatana se saare europe main ek halchal paidaa hui
 Again the war between France and Britain began to cloud
 napolian ne england par akraman karne ke liye uttari samudri tat par bolon main apni sena bheji
 England awakened to the north of its naval contingent on the English Channel and then surprised Napoleon at every encounter
 aamiain kii sandhi ke samaapt hote hi wiliam pit shashan main aayaa or usne england, austria, yas aadi rashtron ko milakar ek tritiy gut banaaya
 Napoleon then barricaded against Austria and ended the Republic of Sisalpine and assumed the position of King of Italy himself
 austria ko ulm ke yuddh main haraaya
 Francis, the ruler of Austria, fled and took refuge in the Tsar
 idhar trafalgar ke yuddh main nelson ne napolian kii jalsena ko haraa diya tha, jisase austria ko phir se napolian ko chunauti dene kaa mauka mil gaya tha
 But when Austerlitz was defeated in the war, Austria had to accept a shameful treaty of the press class
 is safalataa se napolian kaa ullas bad gaya or ab usne germany ko raudna prarambh kiya
 He strengthened the rule of his brother Joseph Bonaparte by creating the Treaty of Rhine, defeating the wars of Jena and Arsed in 14 October 1806
 ab keval rus rah gaya jise napolian ne june 1807 i main freedland ke yuddh main haraakar july 1807 kii tilsit kii sandhi ke liye vivash kiya
 Once the master of all Europe, Napoleon waged an economic war to defeat England
 saare europe ke rashtron kaa vyapaar england se band kar diya tathaa europe kii sari seemaa par ek kathor niyantran lagu kiya
 Britain promulgated a prohibitive command to stop France's trade with the nations of Europe to its north
 britain ne apni kshatipurti upaneveshon se vyapaar badha kar kar lee, kintu europea rashtron kii aarthik sthiti bigadane lagi or ve france kii is yatnaa se peedit ho uthe
 Spain first revolted against this system
 parinamswaroop napolian ne spain par chadhaai kii or vahaan kii satta chin lee
 This sparked a national uprising in Spain
 nepolian isko dabaa bhi nahin paaya tha ki use austria ke vidroh ko dabaanaa padaa or phir kram se prasha or rus ne bhi is vyavastha kii avagya kii
 Russia's rebellion proved disastrous for Napoleon
 uske moscow abhiyaan kii barbaadi itihaas main prasiddh ho gayi he
 Upon returning to Paris, Napoleon again collected an army, but was again defeated at Leipzig by the united armies of Prussia, Russia and Austria
 chaaron ore rashtriya sangram chhid jane se vah sakriy rup se kisi ek raashtra ko na dabaa sakaa tathaa 1814 i main alba dweep bhej diya gaya
 The Allied forces were not able to return even after it was reported that Napoleon's century-long rule began
 at: mitra rashtron ne use 1815 main waterlu ke yuddh main haraakar saint helena kaa karawas diya
 He died there on May 5 in 1821
 nepolian bonapart ne 1799 main satta ko haathon main lekar apni sthiti sudrudh karne tathaa france ko prashasnic sthayitv pradaan karne ke liye vibhinn kshetron main sudhaar kiye
 In fact, the Nepalese had taken over power by ending the rule of the directory and the people of France had accepted that change, then the reason was that it had grown from chaos and chaos
 atah nepolian ke liye yah jaruri tha ki vah aantarik kshetra main ek suvyavasthit shashan or kanoon vyavastha kii sthapana kare
 After becoming First Counsel, Napoleon created a new Constitution for France which was the fourth constitution of the Revolution era
 iske dwaara karypalika shakti teen kanusalaron main nihit kar di gai
 The Principal Counsel had more power than other Counselors
 vastav main samvidhan main ganatantr kaa dikhaaya to jarur tha lekin rajya kii sampoorn satta nepalian ke haathon main kendrit thi
 Napoleon centralized the governance and abolished the local governments of the Departments and Districts and appointed the prefects and sub-prefects
 inaki niyukti tathaa gaanv or shaharon ke sabhi meyaron kii niyukti sidhe kenndriya sarkaar dwaara kii jane lagi
 In this way, Napoleon, the administration's field, kept adequate control over these officers and kept the administration in order and appointed them on the basis of merit
 prashasnic kshetron main nepolian ke sudhaar ek prakaar se kranti ke virdohi ke rup main the kyonki neshnal essembali ne kranti ke dauraan prashasnic dhaanche kaa purna vikendrikaran kar diya tha tathaa desh kaa shashan chalaane kaa daayitv nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko diya gaya tha lekin nepalian ne is vyavastha ko ulat diya or krantipurv vyavastha ko phir se sthapit kiya
 From that point of view he was a laughingstock of revolution
 nepolian ne france kii jarjar aarthik sthiti se use ubaarane kaa praytn kiya
 In this sequence, he first simplified the tax system
 kar vasuulne kaa kaary kendriya karmchaariyon ke jimme kiya tathaa uski vasuuli sakhti se kii jane lagi
 He prohibited unfair profits in bribery, betting, contracting
 usne mitvyayita par bal diya or france kii janata par anek apratyaksh kar lagaae
 Napoleon established the Bank of France to carry out the financial activities in France, which still exists today
 rashtriya rin ko chukaane ke liye usne ek pruthak kosh kii bhi sthapana kii
 As far as possible Napoleon put the burden of military expenditure on the conquered territories and tried to keep the French people free from this burden
 nepolian ne krishi ke sudhaar par bhi bal diya or banjar or retile ilaake ko upjau banane kii yojana banaai
 Napoleon paid considerable attention to the means of transport for the development of trade
 sadaken, naharen banavaai gai vibhinn prakaar ke vyavsaayon kii pragati ke liye yantric shiksha kii vyavastha kii
 To popularize French industrial goods, encouraged the exhibition and encouraged indigenous goods and industries
 berogari kii samasya ko dur karne ke liye nirmaan kaary ko protsaahan diya
 In this way Napoleon recovered France from a state of shabby and insolvency
 kintu aarthik sudhaaron kii drushti se bhi nepolian ke kaary kranti virdohi dikhaai dete hai
 In the Revolution, emphasis was placed on direct taxes, while Napoleon tried to establish an archaic system by emphasizing indirect taxes
 isi prakaar nepolian ne vanijyivaadee darshan ko praathamikta dekar krantivirdohi maansikta kaa pradarshan kiya
 He believed that the state would have to take active intervention to bring balance between the security of the fund and trade, whereas the force of revolution was on free trade
 nepalian aise nagarikon ko chahta tha jo uske evam uske tantra ke prati vishwaas rakhe
 For this, he made reforms by adopting national and secular forms of education
 shiksha ko praathmik, madhyamik or ucch staron par sangathit kiya
 These schools run with the help of teachers appointed by the government, used to have the same curriculum, the same textbooks and the same uniform
 nepolian ne paris main ek vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana kii or usamen latin, french, vigyaan, ganit ityadi vishyon kii shiksha di jaati thi
 This university was not a university in the general sense of the university, but made a system to unite all the institutions from primary to higher education
 shiksha par adhikadhik sarkari niyantran rakhana tathaa vidhyaarthiyon ko shashan ke prati nishthavan bananaa iskaa uddeshy tha
 Napoleon founded the Institute of France for research work
 nepolian kii nari shiksha main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 The burden of their education was left to religious institutions
 france kii bahusankhyak janata catholic carch ke prabhaav main thi
 During the revolution, the power of the church was weakened and brought under the kingdom
 carch kii sampati kaa rashtriyakaran kar diya gaya or padariyon ko rajya kii vafadari kii shapath lene ko kaha gaya
 This angered the Pope and incited the general public to protest
 faltah sarkaar or aamajanata ke bich tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 Napoleon made a pact with the Pope from 1801 called Concardate to overcome it
 uske nimnlikhit praavdhaan the
 Napoleon's most important and permanent work was the creation of the Code of Law
 vastutah kranti ke pehle france kii kanoon vyavastha chhin-bhinn thi or itane prakaar ke kanoon the ki kanoon kaa paalan karaane waalon ko bhi unka gyaan nahin tha or kranti ke dauraan bhi yah araajaktaa bad gai thi
 Napoleon overcame this chaos
 swayan nepolian apni vidhi samhita ko apane 40 yudhon se adhik shaktishaalee maanata tha
 By this code Napoleon established the universal law system in France
 naagarik samhita ke tahat usne parivaar ke mukhiya kaa adhikaar sudrudh kiya
 Women are placed under men and the husband's job is to protect the wife
 talaak kii paddati ko kathin banaaya gaya
 Civil marriage was also arranged in this code
 is prakaar civil vivaah or talaak kii pratha ko manyata dekar nepolian ne europe main is baat kaa prachlan kiya ki bina padariyon ke sahyog ke bhi samaaj kaa kaam chal saktaa he
 Thus other codes such as the Code of Criminal Proc
 Etc
 were created
 uske vyapaarik code main shramjiviyon ke hiton kii upeksha kii gai thi or unke sanghon par pratibandh ko jari rakhaa gaya tha
 In this view Napoleon worked against the ideals of revolution
 iske baavjood is vidhi samhita kii mahatta samooche desh main kanoon kii ekarupata pradaan karne tathaa vyaavhaarik rup se nyaay vyavastha ko aasaan banane main thi
 This code was enforced wherever Napoleon's armies went and remained intact even after Napoleon's defeat
 yah nepolian kii ek sthaayee kirti he
 Napoleon's Code of Law emphasizes the interests of the bourgeoisie more
 bhoomi sambandhi adhikari ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyakti sampati kii raksha ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyaktigat sampati kii raksha ke liye kai kanoon banaae
 Creating a trade union was declared a crime
 mukademen kii sthiti main mazdooron kii daleelon ke badale maalikon kii baton ko nyaayalayon ko maanane ko kaha gaya
 Social equality is also the basis of the civil code
 visheshadhikaar or saamanti niyam kaa samhita main koi sthaan nahin tha
 There was not even a law to consider the elder son as the heir to the property, all the sons were given equal rights on the property
 nepolian ne samaaj main ek naveen kuleen varg kii sthapana kii
 He determined the order of titles according to income
 nepolian kaa yah kaary kranti ke aadarshon ke vipareet tha
 Napoleon's appearance on the European political horizon was like a wandering wheel and he soon became the destiny of Europe on the strength of his process and hard work
 usamen adbhut sainik tathaa prashasnic kshamta se sabhi kochakit kar diya
 But his pillar of strength was like standing on the sand wall
 jo kuch hi varshon main dhwast ho gaya vastut: nepolian kaa utthan or patan chakachaundh karne vaali ulka ke samaan hua
 He shone in the sky of Europe on the strength of military success, but with defeat, the star of his destiny sank
 jis samrajya kii kathin parishram ke pashchaat kaayam kiya gaya tha vah dekhte hi dekhte samaapt ho gaya uske patan ke anek kaaran the jo sa prakaar he
 Infinitely ambitious nepolian aseem mahatvakankshi tha
 The infinite great ambition proves to be the main cause of a person's downfall
 nepolian ke saath bhi yahi baat thi
 As the war progressed, his ambition increased and he began to dream of establishing a world state
 yadi thode se hi vah santusht ho jaataa or jite hue samrajya kii dekhbhaal karata or apana samay usamen lagaataa to use patan kaa durdasha nahin dekhnaa padataa
 Character weakness nepolian main saahas sanyam or dhairya kut- kut kar bharaa tha parantu uski drushti main ghrinaa uskaa pratishodh uskaa kartavya tathaa kshamaadaan kalank tha
 The great weakness of his character was that he did not consider the treaty to be a respected agreement
 kisi bhi desh kii maitri uske liye raajnneetik aavashyaktaa se adhik nahin thi
 Gradually he became stubborn
 He believed that every step of his was okay
 vah kabhi bhul nahin kar saktaa vah dusron kii salaah kii upeksha karne laga
 As a result, his true friends also went away from him
 nepolian kii vyavastha kaa sanyavad par aadhaarit hona- His political system was based on militarism which proved to be the primary cause of its downfall
 vah sabhi maamalon main sena par nirbhar rahata tha falat: vah hameshaa yuddh main hi ulajhaa rahaa
 He forgot that militarism can only be beneficial in times of crisis
 jab tak france vipattiyon ke badal chhaae rahe vahaan kii janata ne uskaa saath diya vipattiyon ke hatate hi janata ne uskaa saath dena chhod diya
 Losing the sympathy and love of the French public proved fatal to him
 uske atirikt parajeet raashtra uske shatru banate gaye jo avasar milte hi uske khilaaf uth khadey hue
 The historian Kabban has rightly written
 ‘nepolian kaa samrajya yuddh main panpa tha yuddh hi uske astitv kaa aadhaar tha or yuddh main hi uskaa ant hua
 ' doshapurn sainik vyavastha- Initially, the French army was steeped in the spirit of patriotism
 uske samaksh ek adarsh kaa or vah ek uddeshy kii purti ke liye yuddh karata tha
 But as his empire expanded, the national form of the army became legalized
 pehle uski sena main francisi sainik te parantu baad main usamen german italian purtegali or dach sainik shaamil kar liya gaya
 As a result, his army became the army of many states
 unke saamne koi adarsh or uddeshy nahin tha
 Hence, his military power continued to weaken and this proved to be an important reason for his downfall
 nausena kii durbalata- Napoleon had properly organized the army, but he lacked a powerful navy, which caused him to be defeated by England
 agar uske paas shaktishaalee nausena hoti to use england se parajeet nahin hona padataa
 Lack of patriotism in the conquered territories usne jin pradeshon par vijay praapt kii vahin kii janata ke hryday main uske prati sadbhaavna or prem nahin tha
 They hated Napoleon's rule
 jab uski shakti kamjor padane lagi to uske adhinsth rajya apni swatantraaa ke liye praytn karne lage
 The European nation formed a fourth bloc for the League against him and consequently was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo
 pope se shatruta- Due to the continental system, he made the Pope his enemy
 jab pope ne usee mahadwipiya vyavastha ko maanane se inkaar kar diya to usne april 1808 main rome par adhikaar kar liya
 And in 1809 AD, the Pope was imprisoned, leading Catholics to believe that Napoleon was the only demon destroying the freedoms of the states
 varanaa unka dharm nasht karne vaala bhi he
 industrial Revolution- kaha jaataa he ki uski paraaj waterlu ke maidan main na hokar manchester ke kaarkaanon or barkingdhan ke lohe ke bhadiyaan main hui
 As a result of the Industrial Revolution, large-2 factories were opened in England and England became prosperous upon seeing it
 falat: vah apni sena kii aadhunik hatyar se sampann kar sakaa jo nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Continental system mahadwipiya vyavastha uski jabardast bhul thi
 He considered England as his biggest enemy
 england kii shakti kaa mukhya aadhaar nausena or vishwavyaapee vyapaar ta uski nausakti ko nepolian samaapt nahin kar sakaa isliye uske vyapaar par aghat karne kii cheshtaa kii gai
 For this purpose, he gave birth to the continental system, he issued an order that no country can do trade with England
 or na to england kii bani hui vastu kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 This was Napoleon's terrible mistake
 is vyavastha ne use ek aise jaal main fasaa diya jisase nikalnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Therefore, the continental system is considered to be the main reason for its collapse
 purtegal ke saath yuddh – Purtigal had a commercial relationship with England, but Napoleon's pressure forced him to break ties with England
 isse purtegal ko kaaphi nuksaan hua
 Therefore, he again established a commercial relationship with England
 isapar nepolian ne krodhit hokar purtegal par akraman kar diya
 This too proved fatal for Napoleon
 spain ke saath sangharsh- Napoleon's third mistake was his interference in Spain's internal affairs
 iske lakhon sainik maare gaye
 As a result, his position in this war became absolutely weak
 jisase uske virodhiyon ko protsaahan mila jab nepolian ne apane bhai ko spain kaa raja banaaya to vahaan ke nivasee us videshi ko raja maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 He drove Napoleon's army from Spain
 us vidroh se anya deshon ko bhi protsaahan mila or ve bhi vidroh karne lage jisase uskaa patan avashyambhavi ho gaya
 Russia's campaign nepolian ne rus par akraman kar baari bhul kii rus ne isaki mahadwipiya vyavastha ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Napoleon attacked Russia at this
 isamen yaddhapi masco par iskaa aadhikaar ho gaya lekin use mahaan kshati uthaani padi
 His opponents planned to attack
 ise akraman main use parajeet hona padaa
 Fatigue anek yuddh main lagaataar vyast rahane ke kaaran vah thak chukaa tha 50 sailaaniyon ne likhaa he nepolian ke patan kaa samast kaaran ek hi shabd thakaan main nihit he
 As he got entangled in the war, as his power weakened, he became tired and due to this his downfall became necessary
 sagesambandhi- His immediate relatives were no less responsible for his downfall
 halanki vah apane sambandhiyon ke prati udaartaa kaa bartaav karata tha
 But whenever he was in trouble, his relatives did not help him
 chaturthgut ke sanghathan- Taking advantage of the weakness of Napoleon, his enemies formed the fourth faction and the Allies defeated him
 use pakad kar salbai bheja gaya or use vahaan kaa swatantra shaasha banaaya gaya lekin nepolian vahaan bahut dinon tak nahin rah sakaa vah sheeghra hi france laut gaya or vahaan kaa shaasha ban baitha
 But this time he remained the emperor for only a hundred days
 mitra rashtron ne 18 june 1815 i
 ko waterlu ke yuddh main antim rup se parajeet kar diya
 The captured Allies sent him as a prisoner to an island called St
 Helena where he died in 1821, at the age of 52 years
 is prakaar uparyukt sabhi kaaran pratyaksh evam apratyaksh rup se uske patan ke liye uttaradaayi the usne yuddh ke dwaara hi apane samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha or yudhon ke chalate hi uskaa patan bhi hua
 That is, those elements who built Napoleon's empire also destroyed them
 emke indira kannada bhashaa kii ek prasiddh upanyaaskaar thi

 kisi nadi, naale athwa ghati par pul banaakar usapar se yadi koi kritrim jaldhara le jaai jaati he, to us pul ko jalawaahi sethu yaa 'jalsetu' kehete hai 
 With the development of engineering, science and industry, nowadays large diameter pipes are made of concrete or iron
 at: jal bahudhaa bade bade nalon main le jaaya jaataa he, jo bhoomi ke tal ke anusaar unche neeche ho sakate hai or varchas kaa dabaav sah sakate hai
 But in ancient times, there were often open drains, or drains made by masonry etc
, which could not bear the pressure of water from inside
 at: unhen udgam se lekar antim sire tak ek niyamit dhaal main le janaa anivaary tha
 Therefore aqueducts had to be made while crossing the river, rivulets or valleys
 bahut badi naharon ke liye, jinka nissaran bade bade nalon kii samaai se bhi kahin adhik hota he, jalsetu aaj bhi anivaary hai
 The oldest aqueducts of the world are found in Italy, France and Spain
 italy main duusari sadi i
pus
 se hi jalavaahini evam jalsetu banane lage the
 The aqueduct named 'pot du Gard', built by the Romans, still stands in Neem, whose grandeur of the design is incomparable
 isamen daaton ke teen str hai: pahile str main 60-70 foot patwali chha:, duusare se 35 foot patwali 11 or tisare str main choti choti 35 daaten hai, jinke upar nahar banaai gai thi
 An aqueduct is 2,780 feet long and 102 feet high in Segoira, with 109 masonry plots on two floors
 yah abhi tak prayog main aata he
 In Jisalem long ago, since the time of the King of Sada, water was used by the drains
 is prakaar kii ek 20 mile lambii jalavaahini hinam kii ghati ko daaton ke upar se paar karti he
 Many excellent specimens of medieval aqueducts are found in Kustuntunia

 In the agrarian country India, canals for irrigation were there since ancient times
 himalay kii talahati ke ilaakon main jangalon main aisi anek naharon ke chhipe avshesh mili hai, jo kahin kahin, jaise ruhelkhand main, nai sinchai vyavastha ke aadhaar ban gaye hai
 Many canals were also built during the Muslim period
 in sabamein jalsetu bhi rahe honge; kintu aaj kisi kaa pataa nahin he
 Today's Indian canals, many of which are unmatched in the world, have several aqueducts, which are excellent examples of engineering skills
 upree ganga nahar main rudki ke paas solani jalsetu 19veen shatee ke madhya main bana
 It has 15 pieces of 50-foot span, over which a 164-foot-wide and 10-foot deep canal crosses the Solani River
 solani kii ghati main lagbhag mile lambey or 36 foot unche band par yah nahar bahati he, jiskaa teen mile se adhik bhaag pakki chinai kaa he
 The Nadarai aqueduct on the Kali River on the 34th mile of the lower Ganga Canal has its own historical feature
 1878 i
 main praarambhik jaankaree ke anusaar, jiskaa koi pakkaa aadhaar nahin tha, nearesth railway pul or ek sadi puraane sadak pul ko dekhte hue 18,000 ghan foot prati second nissaran ke liye 35 foot patwali 5 daaton kaa ek jalsetu banaaya gaya
 Here the flood depth of the Kali River was estimated at 13 feet
 kintu chah varsh baad hi 1884 i
 main aisi bheeshan baadh ai ki pani 22 foot tak chadh gaya or nissaran 40,000 ghan foot prati second ho gaya
 As a result, the aqueduct was broken
 uske sthaan par bada jalsetu banane kii yojana abhi ban hi rahi thi or toote hue bhaag kii asthaayee marammat hui hi thi ki agle varsh or bhi bheeshan baadh ai jiskaa 1,40,000 ghan foot prati second nissaran apane maarg ke sabhi pul baha le gaya
 The total remains of the two sides of this aqueduct also remain as a memorial
 tadnantar vartmaan jalsetu, jo bharat main sarvshereshth or shaayad vishwa main apane jaisaa vishaltam he, 1889 i
 main bana
 It has 15 pieces of 60-foot span and the width of the bridge is 149 feet
 antyadhar or payon kii neenv ke liye 268 kune galaae gaye the, jinka kul galaan 15,019 foot arthath teen mile se kuch kam tha
 Further in this canal, two more aqueducts in Fatehpur district, one near Barenda and the other at Silmi
 uttar pradesh ke hamirpur jile main dhasaan nahar par kohniya jalsetu he
 It has 11 rates with 30-foot patt and the canal floor is 33 feet above the bottom of the drain
 is jalsetu kii kul lambaai 1,300 foot he
 The southern aqueducts on the kurmool-kadapa canal originating from the Tungabhadra river in south India and the aqueducts on the lower Maswad canal are notable
 madhya pradesh ke majhagavaan jalsetu or mawapura jalsetu bhi ullekhneey hai
 The first has 15 passes with 30-foot patt, the aqueduct is 1,000 feet in length and 64 feet in height from the bottom of the drain
 doosraa bhi isi akruti kaa he, jisamen 30 foot patwale 12 darre hai
 There are about 20 aqueducts in addition to the centuries-old culverts on both the canals originating on both the right and left banks of the Godavari River
 bihar main gandak nadi ke uttari awah kshetra ko seenchnewali keval 61 mile lambii triveni nahar main bhi 18 jalsetu hai
 The reason for these canals having so many aqueducts is that they flow parallel to the river in Dhaalu region, where they have to cross all the tributaries and drains of the river
 iske vipareet samtal punjab kii 134 mile lambii nichali baari dwaaba nahar main keval ek jalsetu hai
 Pakistan's Upper Swat Canal is also notable from the point of view that it has been built in very difficult conditions in the mountains
 isamen choti badi aath surangen or kai jalsetu hai
 The Thapangang aqueduct design of the Mandalay Canal in Burma is important from the point of view
 ominkyang pahari nadi he, jo baadh ke samay itani teji se badhati he ki paanch ghante main hi 20 foot unchaa pani chadh janaa maamuli baat he
 Due to not having so much scope under the canal floor, seven feet high wooden planks have been placed on both the sides, between which the canal flows
 nadi kaa baadhkalin nissaran adhiktam 60,000 ghan foot prati second koota jaataa he, jab ki 22 foot patwali 12 daron se keval 24,000 ghan foot pani prati second nikal saktaa he
 At the time of flood, the planks can be dropped one by one so that the excess water of the river passes through the top of the dam
 jalsetu ke abhikalp ke siddhant ve hi hai, jo pulon ke hai
 The walls on either side of the canal are made like the walls of the buttress
