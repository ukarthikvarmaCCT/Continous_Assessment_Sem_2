 Even after that the program becomes very popular
 ek raat krupa or prithvi ke parivaar vaale un donon kii shaadi tay karte he
 But Angad tells Krupa that he loves her
 or is kaaran krupa shaadi se inkaar kar detii he
 With this begins the love story of Krupa and Angad
 lekin yah rishta kai logon ko acha nahin lagata he
 Such as: Naina Khanna, Mishti and Prithvi
 naina use angad ke jivan se hataane ke liye kuch jhuthe saboot bana kar angad ko dikhti he
 She shows that Kripa loves the Earth and is married to Angad for money only
 yah jaan kar angad krupa se saare rishte tod detaa he or mishti se shaadi karne kaa nirnay letaa he
 Kripa was about to give birth to Angad's child and due to this she moved away from Angad but due to an incident that child could not survive
 angad kii daadi angad ko bataati he ki uski maan ne jo saboot diye vah sabhi jhuthe hai
 When the truth is known, he breaks the marriage on the day of Angad and Mishti's wedding
 lekin vahiin krupa yah sab kaa jimmedaar angad ko maanati he or use barbaad karne kaa nishchay karti he
 Angad admits that he loves Krupa very much and he speaks to his friend Josh to help Krupa
 jisase krupa ek lokapriy va safal gayak ban gai
 At the same time Angad became a failed singer
 tabhi josh krupa ko bataata he ki uske kaaran hi vah ek safal gayika ban saki
 Knowing this, Krupa forgives her and she agrees to accompany him to the program to make him successful again
 lekin krupa uske mitra prithvi, jisane uski har samay sahaayta kii, usase shaadi karne kaa nirnay leti he
 At the same time, after the program of Angad and Kripa, they both become successful and popular again
 tabhi krupa or prithvi ki shaadi kii taiyaari shuru ho jaati he or josh krupa ko yah samajhaata he ki vah angad se pyaar karti he
 Prithvi breaks off the marriage to reunite Angad and Kripa
 iske baad krupa or angad ek ho jate he
 After a few days, Angad tries to make a fatal attack on him
 krupa ko lagata he ki yah kaary josh kaa he
 She tells this to Angad
 isse angad or josh ke bich kuch dooriyaan ban jaati he, lekin vah is maamle ko sulajhaa lete hai
 Josh then says that this work is done by the earth without grace
 lekin use prithvi maar detaa he
 His death comes to Angad
 use krupa nirdosh maanati he or ke vakil ko is prakaran ke liye chunati he
 But Simone convinces Krupa that Angad is a liar
 krupa bhi use doshi samajhati he or nyaayalay main uske khilaaf gavaahi detii he
 Due to which Angad goes to jail and at the same time Angad's heart is broken
 ek varsh pashchaat krupa dubai main prithvi ke saath shaadi kar leti he
 Just then, a person who looks like an Angad scares him
 lekin is par koi bhi vishwaas nahin karata he ki angad dubai main he
 When Prithvi learns about Angad from Mumbai Police, it is learned that Angad died due to an accident while taking Angad to another jail
 yah baat sun kar krupa stambh rah gai
 Even after this, she was in love with Angad
 tabhi uski mulaaqaat zib se hoti he jo ek gayak he
 Angad also meets them all by becoming zaib
 lekin vah dikhaata he ki vah zib he or sabhi yah maan lete hai yah maanane ki koshish karte he
 But Zaib confesses to Krupa that he is Angad and that he escaped from the prison by accident
 vah krupa se usko jail bhejne ke kaaran maansik rup se use tadapaa rahaa tha
 He gets engaged to Mishti in Mumbai, so that he can come close to the Bose family
 vah prithvi or krupa ke shaadi ke todane ke bahut kareeb pahunch chukaa tha
 Then Kripa pretends to sleep in front of Angad with her husband Prithvi
 jisase angad krodhit ho jaataa he or apana aakhri patta kholta he or kahata he ki vahiin zib / angad he or vah pehle se hi krupa ke saath shaadi kar chukaa he
 After this, Prithvi breaks off the marriage with grace
 angad krupa ko shaadi ke liye kahata he or vah donon ek duusare se shaadi kar lete he, taaki ek duusare ko tabah kar saken
 Kripa opens Angad's episode to send Angad back to prison through the episode
 angad kahata he ki usne krupa ke byaan dene ke kaaran vah jurm kabuula tha
 And Angad's friends reveal the truth to Kripa, that Mishti had told him a lie
 iske baad josh ke vaastavik hatyare kaa pataa chalata he
 It was none other than Prithvi who tried to kill Angad and revealed the truth to Josh
 isi ke kaaran usne josh kii bhi hatya kar di
 After all this is proved in court, Prithvi runs away and goes into a coma due to police firing
 angad adaalat se reeha ho jaataa he or vah phir se krupa ke saath pyaar bhari jindagi shuru karata he
 Mishti files a rape case on Angad to avenge her brother Prithvi but the episode Angad wins
 parantu is prakaran ke samay krupa angad par vishwaas nahin karti or is kaaran vah is baar use maaf nahin karata he
 Kripa leaves Angad's house and goes away
 vah ek vyapaaree nishanth saxena ke yahan kaary karne lagati he
 Angad Kripa takes away all the memories and becomes a successful singer
 nishanth angad ke saath apana vyapaar jodta he or is kaaran vah krupa ke saath mumbai aa jaataa he
 Angad finds it very useless for Kripa
 iske baad krupa ki sagaai nishanth ke saath or angad ki sagaai kanan ke saath ho jaati he
 Angad then learns that Prateek is his son
 or jab sari sachai use pataa chalati he to vah krupa ko phir se shaadi ke liye kahata he
 But Kripa refuses to marry
 kyonki nishanth ki maan ko hryday rog he or vah nishanth or krupa ko shaadi karte hue dekhnaa chaahati hai
 But Angad later realizes that she was married only for show
 angad or krupa ke pichley samay kaa pataa nishanth ko chal jaataa he or vah un donon ko milaane ki koshish karata he
 So he goes to Angad to Dubai with Kripa and then Kripa gets a call that Angad is going to be killed
 nishanth is bare main angad ko bataata he
 But he goes to a public function to sing and shoots there but Nishant arrives there to save Angad
 lekin goli use lagati he or uski maut ho jaati he
 This attack is not by anyone but Angad's father
 iske baad krupa mumbai aa jaati he or angad dubai main hi uske aane kaa intjaar karata he
 At the same time he also takes care of Nishant's family
 sanyog se nishanth or angad ke parivaar dwaara vah phir se milte hai or uske baad vah kabhi nahin bichhadte
 After this, Kripa and Angad's second child is born
 iske baad sabhi khushi-khushi rahete hai or kahani kaa antim bhaag samaapt ho jaataa he

 dodo hind mahaasaagar ke dweep morishas kaa ek sthaneey pakshi tha
 It was overland even in the bird square, as it did not have the ability to fly
 17veen sadi ke ant tak yah pakshi maanav dwaara atyaadhik shikaar kiye jane ke kaaran vilupt ho gaya
 This bird belonged to the family of pigeons and fakhatas
 yah murge ke aakaar kaa lagbhag ek meter unchaa or 20 kilogram vajan kaa hota tha
 It had many tails
 yah apana ghonslaa zamin par banaata tha, tathaa isaki khuraaq main sthaneey fal shaamil the
 The dodo was a large, chubby bird larger than the hen
 isaki taangen choti va kamjor thim, jo uskaa vajan sambhaal nahin paati thim
 Its wings were also very short, not enough for the dodo to fly
 is kaaran yah na tej daud saktaa tha, na ud saktaa tha
 When the colorful dodos rolled and fell in herds, the locals were entertained
 dodo shabd kii utpatti portugali shabd doudo se hui he, jiskaa arth murkh yaa bawalaa hota he
 He is also said to have introduced the dodo bird to the Mughal court, where the court painter had also painted this strange and clumsy bird
 kuch pranishastriyon ke anusaar pehle ateet main udanksham dodo, paristhitijanya kaarnon se dhire-dhire udne kii kshamta kho baithe
 The dodo now appears in the national symbol of Mauritius
 iske alaava dodo kii vilupti ko maanav gatividhiyon ke kaaran hui na badalane vaali ghatnaon ke ek udhaaharan ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 There were no natural predators of the Dodo before humans arrived on the island of Mauritius
 yahi kaaran he ki yah pakshi udaan bharne me sakasham nahin tha
 Its behavior was completely fearless towards humans and due to its inability to fly it became easy prey
 17veen shatabdi ke aarambh main dach log jab pehali baar morishas pahunche tab vahaan pehle maanav aabaadi nahin thi
 He called the dodo a Volgvogel, a gruesome bird
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yahi tha ki iske maans ko bahut pakaane par bhi, vah naram or swaadisht nahin banataa tha
 But still the Dutch continued to hunt it and eventually by 1681 the Dodo disappeared from the island
 yahaan manushyon ke aane se pehle dodo ko maarane vaala koi nahin tha, atev dodo ne apni raksha kshamta ekadam bhula di thi
 They proved so helpless, that even the rats used to eat their eggs and chicks
 vaigyanikon ne dodo kii haddiyon ko dobaaraa se jod kar ise aakaar dene kaa prayaas kiya he or ab is praaroop ko morishas institute main dekha ja saktaa he
 He has also done research saying that it can be recovered by DNA
 puraane dastavejo me haalaanki iske maance ko beswad or kathor bataaya gaya he jabaki anya sthaneey prajatiyon jaise laal rail ke maance ke swaad kii saraahna kii gai he
 It is generally believed that Malay sailors considered it a sacred bird, and they used to hunt dodos to make their hats used in religious rituals from its wings
 kuch pranishastriyon ke anusaar pehle kabhi udana jaanate dodo, kuch paristhitijanya kaarnon se udana bhul gaye the
 Their habit and lazy nature became the reason for their destruction, because they easily got caught in the hands of canine cats
 is prakaar 1640 tak dodo puri tarah se vilupt ho gaye
 It was last seen alive in 1638 in London
 ek tathy yah bhi he ki, jab manushya pehle pahal morishas pahunche, to ve apane saath un jaanavaro ko bhi laaye jo pehle is dweep par nahin paye jate the, jaise kute, boar, billiyaan, chuuhe or kekada khaane vaale macok bandar
 These animals destroyed the dodo's nests, while humans destroyed the forests here where the birds lived
 aajkal yah mana jaataa he ki dodo kii vilupti ke liye shikaar se bhi adhik boar or macok jaise jaanavar uttaradaayi hai

 Artism is known as the antonym of utilitarianism in the field of literature and art
 is siddhant kaa pratipaadan victor kuje ne 1818 main kiya
 According to it, the purpose of art is not to achieve any moral or religious purpose, but to seek its own perfection
 kala soundaryanubhuti kaa vaahak he isaliye ise upyogita kii kasuti par nahin parkhaa janaa chaiye
 Adherence to the rules of society, policy, religion, philosophy etc
 are a hindrance to the free and spontaneous expression of art
 kalavaadiyon ke anusaar kalakaar lokottar praani, kala lokatit vastu tathaa kalajanya anand alokik aswadyukt evam samajanirpeksh hota he
 Conversely, utilitarian art is considered not only as a powerful means of changing the attitudes of the society towards the desired direction, but also considers it as the best medium of principle propagation
 upyogetavaadiyon ne kalavaadiyon par sankeern evam vyaktinishth hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha he, ve viviya ghode par arudh hai
 The Artists accused Utilitarians of being a subservient to gross socialism and said, they had promised to give us heaven, but have given Rugnalaya
 vichaarkon kaa ek teesraa varg bhi he jo kalawaad ke vyaktipaksh or upyogetavaad ke samajapaksh ke samanvay ko hitkar maanata he
 The ostensible power of the artistic approach is constantly found in Europe in some form or the other from Plato and Aristotle to the present day
 plato ne apane granth 'republic' main kaviyon or kalakaaron ko rashtrabahishkrut kar dene kii vyavastha di he; kaaran, unki drushti main kalpanasheel kalakaaron evam kaviyon kaa aseem prabhaav naitik evam saamaajik drushti se avaanchhneeya tha
 Even though Aristotle has not openly refuted the moral and social beliefs of his mentor Plato, as well as the moral elements and didacticism in art have not disproved them, Aristotle, according to the famous philosopher Butcher, was the first to initiate ethics
 Isolated and told that refined bliss is the ultimate goal of poetry or art
 rome ke prasiddh vichaarak sisaron ne shaleenta tathaa udaattata ko kala kaa pramukh pratipaadya nirdhaarit kiya he
 Longinus in his work 'periapsus' not only considered art as distinct and superior to education and entertainment, but also distinguished it on the higher plane of communication and advised its independent evaluation
 longinus ke anusaar kavy tathaa kala kaa mukhya tatv udaatt he or bhaavana kaa udaattikaran hi unka pradhan parinaam hota he jiskaa vyakti se bhi or samaaj se bhi sidhaa sambandh rahata he
 Therefore, Longinus is certainly centrist in his statement and rendering
 dionisis tathaa demetrius prabhruti anya anek roman vichaarkon ne kavy tathaa kala ke shailipaksh par hi vishesh jor diya he
 Pallavan of classical or classical art of Europe was mostly under the protection of Christianity or 'church'
 at: saatvin se 15veen shatee isvi ke bich rome ko centre maanakar jis baijantiya kala kaa vikaas misr se rus tak hua, vah carch ashrith hone ke kaaran naitik-dharmik-mulya-samanvit thi, at: uskaa soddeshy tathaa upadeshaatmak hona jaruri tha or isiilie usamen kalapaksh gaun hi rahaa
 Even then it is not that there was no relaxation of imagination and feelings in the art of the said period
 iske vipareet dharmik drushtisampann kalakaar bina kisi bahari niyantran athwa baadhyataa ke ucch koti kii kala kaa srijan karte the
 Tolstoy was strongly opposed to the artistic ideology
 unke mat se dharm ke prati vishwaas kaa abhaav hi kalavaadi vichaaron ko janm detaa he or kala kaa saadhy na anand he, na hi saundarya
 He was adamant about morality and like Gandhiji his outlook was reformist
 sudhaarwad prakarantar se upyogetavaad hi he
 Therefore, for Tolstoy, art was definitely a secondary instrument
 italy ke mahan kavi aaligyari dante ne kala ke kshetra main pun: udaatt gunon evam bhavy style kii pratishtha kii
 Dante's influence lasted only a few days
 pashchaat shastreey drushti dhire-dhire romani drushtikon se aachhadit hone lagi
 As a result, there was a huge change in the artistic values at this time
 17veen shatabdi ko kala kii drushti se kaaphi mahatvapurn kaha ja saktaa he
 Neoliberalism emerged in France during this period
 lekin yah bhi madhyakaalin chintan ke naveen sanskaran se adhik nahin tha
 Medieval moral values began to disintegrate in Europe after Renaissance, which not only created an atmosphere of instability between traditionalist and independent ideas, but also led to a mutual conflict
 iskaa kaaran is samay kisi sudrudh darshan kaa abhaav tha
 In 1866 AD, in the enforcement of almost diverse literary and artistic promises, in France, the French country, 'l'art Por l'art', came out with a formula whose English translation is 'art for Art's Sec' and in Hindi with the phrase 'art for Art' Is known
 yaheen se kalavaadi vichaardhaara kaa pratyaksh aarambh mana ja saktaa he
 American painter James Abbott mcneil Hwisler, who lived in France and England for a lifetime, became a strong supporter of artism
 hua yah ki 1877 i
 main grosvener chitrakala pradarshnee main angreji ke prakhyat samalochak ruskin ne hvisler ke chitron kii tikhi aalochana kii or kaha, hvisler apane chitron ke madhyam se darshakon ke chehron par rangabhari pyaaliyaan undel detaa he
 Ruskni's statement triggered a court trial in which Hwisler eventually received a fathering as compensation
 iske baad bhi kala ke uddeshy ko lekar ruskin or hvisler ke bich vadavivaad chalata rahaa
 Ruskin considered art to be completely independent and self-contained apart from morality
 isi se prerit hokar hvisler ne apni puri shakti se 'kala kala ke liye' mat kaa pravartan kiya jo atvaad kii seemaa tak ja pahunchaa
 Bradley, Clive Bell, Roger Fai, and George Innes, etc
, were strong advocates of the critical critical ideology
 breadle ne to apane granth 'poetry for poetries sek' main spasht rup se ghoshnaa kii ki naitikta kavita kaa maatr bahya paksh he
 Therefore, it is absolutely irrational to consider it essential for the superiority of the poem
 clive bel ne aadhunik chitrakala ke sandarbh main rupatatv ko pramukh mana or 1914 i
 main 'siganifikent farm' kaa siddhant prastut kiya jiskaa punaradha roger faai ne 1920 i main kiya
 Artism gained a clear philosophical foundation from the expression of Croche
 kaant kii sthapana 'saundarya kaa koi bahya astitv nahin he' ko aadhaar banaakar kroche ne apane 'laa spirito' naamak granth main saundaryabodh ke liye 'ant: pragna' kii satta kaa pratipaadan kiya or bataaya ki saundaryasrishti tathaa saundaryanubhuti donon hi sookshm maansik vyapaar hai
 At the same time there is elemental unity between varna and manifestation
 at: kalapaksh or vastupaksh ko vicchhinn karke dekhnaa bhraamak he
 According to Croche, art is basically a spiritual activity, so in its view, art has no other purpose or purpose except expression
 itnaa hi nahin, kroche ne kala ko naitik kinwa shaikshanik simaaon se mukt bhi mana he
 In a way, utilizing Croche's theory in a way denies utilitarian recognition, but the said principle applies only to the intangible trade of art, not to the tangible
 kroche kaa kala siddhant tatvat: samajavirohi nahin he kyonki moort hone par vah bhi kala ko samajanirpeksh nahin maanata
 The artistic vision was also strengthened by the 'dreamism' of Freud

richards ne apni pustak 'principles ov litereri critisine' main kalavaadi drushti kaa khandan saidhantik aadhaar par karte hue preshniyata ko kavyprakriya main vishesh mahatv pradaan kiya tathaa kaha ki kavy kii satta shesh jagat se bhinn nahin he or na hi kavy kii anubhuti shesh jagat kii anubhuti se bhinn he
 Thus Richards re-established utilitarianism in the field of art
 marxvad ke udai ke saath kalavaadi manyataon kaa teji se vighatan hua
 Marx adopted a utilitarian approach to art in his economics and said that art is for the public, mainly for soldiers and workers
 stallin ne rus main or maao ne china main kala tathaa sahitya ko raajnneeti ke prachaar kaa pramukh saadhan mana evam usapar rajshakti kaa ankush laga diya
 In his circular titled 'problems of Art and Literature', Mao expressed his faith in the above mentioned installations of Marx
 marxvaadi samalochak codwell ne bhi kalavaadi vichaardhaara ko vishuddh burjua drushti se utpann kutsit vritti kaa parinaam bataaya he
 In the Marxist camp, Trotsky is the only person who considers the interference of political party in the field of art unfair
 'litarechar and revolution' naamak apane granth main usne spasht kaha he, kala ke kshetra main party ko aadesh dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 It is fine that the duties of the party are also to protect and assist the art, but leadership can be done only indirectly in that area

 hazrat imam hossain ebn ali or unke parivaar or saathiyon ko shahid kar diya tha The Battle of Karbala or the Battle of Karbala took place in the Islamic calendar 10 Muharram 61 Hijri in the city of Karbala in present-day Iraq
 yah ladaai paigambar mohammad ke navaase hazrat imam hossain ebn ali ke samarthakon or rishtedaaron ke ek chote samooh ke or umayyad atyachari shaasha yajid pratham kii ek badi sainya algaav ke bich hui thi
 The battle of Karbala is a very important event in human history
 yah sirf ek ladaai hi nahin balki jindagi ke sabhi pahaluon kii maarg darshak bhi he
 The foundation of this battle was laid after the demise of Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa
 imam ali a0 kaa caliph bananaa kuch adharmee logo ko pasand nahin tha to kai ladaiyaan huin ali a0 ko shahid kar diya gaya, to unke pashchaat hazrat imam hasan ebn ali a0 khalipha bane unako bhi shahid kar diya gaya
 Yazid, the ruler of the time, is believed to be wicked and cruel and used to do un-islamic work under his rule, the people of Iraq and Kufa wrote Hazrat Imam Hussein several letters and asked him to come to Kufa so that he could get the bait in his hands
 By making him their caliph, Yazid wanted Hussein to be with him, he knew that if Hussein came with him, all Islam would be in his grasp
 lakh dabaav ke baad bhi hossain ne uski kisi bhi baat ko maanane se inkaar kar diya, to yajid ne hossain ko rokane kii yojana banaai
 On May 4, 680 AD, Imam Hussein left his home in Medina and reached the city of Makke, where he intended to perform Haj, but came to know that the enemies could come and disguise the Hajis
 hossain ye nahin chaahate the ki kaaba jaise pavitra sthaan par khun bahe, phir imam hossain ne haj kaa iraadaa badal diya or shahar kufe kii ore chal die
 On the way, an army of enemies surrounded them and brought them to Karbala
 imam hossain ne karbala main jis jameen par apane kheme lagaae, us jameen ko pehle imam hossain ne kharida, phir us sthaan par apane kheme lagaae
 Yazid continued to pressurize Imam Hussain through his chiefs to accept Hussain, when Imam Hussain did not obey Yajid's conditions, the enemies finally put a guard of the army on the canal and prevented Hussain from entering the camps
 Has been applied yajid kii fouj ko dekh kar kufa iraq ke log jinhone imam hossain ko bulaayaa tha apana khalipha banane ke liye unhone ne bhi saath chhod diya
 After three days passed, when the children of the Imam's family started thirsting, Husain asked for water from the Yazidi army, the enemy refused to give water, the enemies thought that Imam Husain would break with thirst and accept all our conditions
 jab hossain teen din kii pyaas ke baad bhi yajid kii baat nahin maane to dushmano ne hossain ke khemon par hamale shuru kar die
 After this, Imam Hussein asked the enemies for one night and that whole night Imam Hussein and his family prayed to Allah and prayed that my family, my friends may be martyred, but Allah’s poor 'islam', which Nana came with him, he was saved
 10 oktober, 680 i
 ko subah namaaj ke samay se hi jang chhid gai jang to kahana thik na hoga, kyonki ek ore lakhon kii fouj thi, duusari taraf 72 sadasyon kaa parivaar or unamem kuch mard, lekin itihaaskaar jang hi likhte hai
 By the way, there were only 75 or 80 men with Imam Hussain, including children from 6 months to 13 years
 islam kii buniyaad bachaane main karbala main 72 log shahid ho gaye, jinamein dushmano ne chah maheene ke bachche ali asagar ke gale par teen nok vaala tir maaraa, 13 saal ke bachche hazrat kasim ko jinda rahete ghodon kii taapon se rond dalwaaya or saat saal aath maheene ke bachche oun-mohammad ke sir par talwaar se waar kar shahid kar diya tha

 Plate tectonics is a scientific theory that provides an explanation of the large-scale movements in the Earth's terrain

 This theory evolved from the concept of continental displacement, envisaged in the first decade of the twentieth century, when new evidence was discovered in the 1960s that strengthened the concept of continents being dynamic rather than static
 in saakshyon main sabase mahatvapurn hai purachumbakatv se sambandhit sakshya jinase sagar nital prasaran kii pushti hui
 The discovery of Sagar Nittal Varshan by Harry Hayes is believed to be the beginning of the rendering of this theory and scholars like Wilson, Morgan, mckenzie, Oliver, Parker etc
 contributed to its promotion by providing evidence in its favor

 These plates are floating on the semicircular layer of the asthenosphere at the bottom and are generally moving at a speed of about 10–40 mm / yr, although some have a velocity of 160 mm / yr
 inhi platon ke gatisheel hone se prithvi ke vartmaan dharatleey swaroop kii utpatti or parvat nirmaan kii vyakhya prastut kii jaati he or yah bhi dekha gaya he ki praayah bhucamp in platon kii simaaon par hi aate hai or jwalamukhi bhi inhen plate simaaon ke sahare paae jate hai
 In plate tectonics, the word tectonics is derived from the Greek language τεκτονικός meaning to relate to construction
 plate shabd kaa sarvapratham prayog canada ke bhuvigyaani wilson ne kiya tha or plate tectonix shabd kaa pehali baar prayog morgan dwaara kiya gaya tha
 According to this theory, the lithosphere, located as the upper layer of the earth, consisting of the crust and some part of the upper mantle, is divided into several pieces called plates

 Apart from this, there are some medium and small size plates

 In the context of mountain construction, two views were first prevalent, by vertical movement and horizontal movement

 The concept was first propagated in Europe by Austrian Edward Swoos
 iske vipareet kuch kaa maananaa tha ki mahadwipon kaa kshaitij sthantharan hua he or inke takaraane se upree sataha main bal pad jane se parvaton kaa nirmaan hua he
 The first challenge to contractionists was when the concept of horizontal transfer of continents emerged
 shuruuaati solahavin sadi main hi vidwaanon ne atlantic mahaasaagar ke donon kinaaron kii ek duusare se samanta ko chihnit kiya tha
 The English philosopher Francis Bacon first marked this resemblance with the study of exact maps, with the cartographer Abraham Ortelius saying in 1596 that the Americas broke apart from Europe and Africa, and the German theologian Theodor Lilienthal's statement of Ortelius in 1756 Attempted to confirm on the basis of a biblical statement

 Wagner was the first to use the term "continental displacement", following the same principle of Wagner that the development of plate tectonics was possible, although his ideas were also rejected by scholars for nearly half a century until evidence was available in the 1960s
 
 or mahadwipiya visthaapan Due to the mobility of the plates, there are three types of edges or borders: is prakaar ke kinaaron ke sahare do platen ek duusare kii ore gati karti hai or takaraakar unamem se baari plate halaki plate ke neeche kshepit hoti he
 This part, which is twisted downward, goes deep and melts and converts into magma due to the excess of heat and pressure
 jis gaharaai par yah ghatana hoti he use kshepan mandal yaa beniof zone kehete hai
 With the help of such edges, due to pressure of the landowners, they turn and form mountains
 neeche jaakar pighla padaarth megma plum ke rup main upar uth kar jwalamukhiyata bhi utpann karata he
 Where two plates move opposite to each other, that is, they move away from each other, magma rises up from the bottom to form a new plate

 Rift valleys are formed when this shore lies on a continent
 nayi plate ke nirmaan ke kaaran ise rachanaatmak kinaaraa bhi kehete hai
 The protective edge is the one with which the two platens are moving, rubbing each other, that is, neither descending nor converging
 saamanytah is kinare ke sahare ek duusare ko ragadate huye vipareet dishaao main gatisheel hoti hai kintu yah anivaary nahin he, yadi do platen ek hi disha main gatisheel hon or unki gati alag-alag ho tab bhi unke kinare ragadate huye sangrakshi kinaaraa bana sakate hai
 Transform faults are found on their support

 Plate tectonics theory offers the newest explanation of the construction of fine mountains
 udhaaharan ke liye alpine parvat tantra ke parvaton kii utpatti kii vyakhya ko prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 According to this theory it is believed that the series of mountains on the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean Sea are the result of tectonic events in the Tertiary era in which they were formed by compression between the African and European plates of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea

 Lord Prathpara was the first Tirthankara in this period of his journey, followed by Lord Parshva
 jain dharm sikhaata he ki prayek jeev apane karmo ke liye savyam jimmevaar he
 It insists that we live, think and act respectfully and honor the spiritual nature of all life
 Jains view God as the unchanging traits of the pure soul of each living being, chiefly described as Infinite Knowledge, Perception, Consciousness, and Happiness
 Jainism does not include a belief in an omnipotent supreme being or creator, but rather in an eternal universe governed by natural laws, and the interplay of its attributes of matter
 Jain scriptures were written over a long period and the most cited is the Tattvartha Sutra, or Book of Reality written by Umasvati ,the monk-scholar, more than 18 centuries ago
 The primary figures in Jainism are Tirthankars
 Jainism has two main divisions: Digambar and Shvetambar and both believe in ahimsa, asceticism, karma, sansar, and jiva
 Compassion for all life, human and non human, is central to j Jainism
 Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment and to kill any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is unimaginably abhorrent
 It is the only religion that requires monks and laity, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian
 Some Indian regions have been strongly influenced by Jains and often, the majority of the local non Jain population has also become vegetarian
 History suggests that various strains of Hinduism became vegetarian due to strong Jain influences
 In many towns, Jains run animal shelters, eg Delhi has a bird hospital run by a Jain temple
 Svetambara Jain worshipping at the temple at Ranakpur

 The cloth over his face is to prevent spit, mucus, or bacteria from the mouth or nose from landing on holy images, books or the idols of the Tirtankars Jainism's stance on nonviolence goes beyond vegetarianism
 Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty
 Many are vegan due to the violence of modern dairy farms
the orthodox Jain diet excludes most root vegetables, as they believe this destroys life unnecessarily
 Another reason for refusing root vegetables is to avoid destroying entire plants
 If you eat apples, you do not destroy whole trees, but for root vegetables, whole plants are uprooted
 Garlic and onions are avoided as these are seen as creating passion, meaning anger, hatred, jealousy
 Observant Jains do not eat, drink, or travel after sunset and always rise before sunrise
 Anekantavada, a foundation of Jain philosophy literally meaning "nonsingular Conclusivity", or equivalently, "non-one-endedness"
 Anekantavad consists of tools for overcoming inherent biases in any one perspective on a topic, object, process, state, or on reality in general
 Another tool is The Doctrine of Postulation, Syādvāda
 Anekantavad is defined as a multiplicity of views for it stresses looking at things from another's perspective
 Jains are remarkably welcoming and friendly toward other faiths
 Several non-jain temples in India are administered by Jains
 The Jain Heggade family has run the Hindu institutions of Dharmasthala, including the Sri Manjunath Temple, for eight centuries
 Jains willingly donate money to churches and mosques and usually help with interfaith functions
 Jain monks, like Acharya Tulsi and Acharya Sushil Kumar, actively promoted harmony among rival faiths to defuse tension
 Jains have been a palpable presence in Indian culture, developing to Indian philosophy, art, architecture, sciences, and to Mohandas Gandhi's politics, which led to the mainly non-violent movement for Indian independence

 bas chhathi sadak se kuch kaanse ke lote or tin kii tashtariyaan kharid laaye or grahasthi basaa lee
 One downstairs, on the third floor of the house, was Soo Jaur Jansi's studio
 jansi, jona kaa apbhransh tha
 One came from 'maine' and the other from 'california'
 donon kii mulaakaat, aathvin sadak ke ek atyant saste hotel main hui thi
 There was so much similarity between their taste and food preferences that a mixed studio was born
 yah baat may ke maheene kii thi
 In the winter of November, an unknown stranger, who doctors call 'pneumonia'
 muhalle main deraa daal kar, apni barfili ungaliyon se logon ko chhedana shuru kiya
 In the eastern region, this Satyanshi had created a scare with the sacrifice of many people, but in the trap of the narrow streets of the west, his movement slowed down a bit
 mistar 'nimonia' striyon ke saath bhi koi riayat nahin karte the
 a slim girl who had lost her blood due to the California storms had no match with this giant rocking monster, yet she attacked Jansi
 vah bechaari chupchaap apni lohe kii khaat par padi rahati or shishe kii khidki main se saamne ke iton ke makaan kii kori diwaar ko dekha karti
 One day the old doctor treating him, shaking the thermometer, called Suu to the outside verandah and said, "the possibility of his living is two rupees and that too if his willpower remains
" jab logon ke man main jeene kii ichha hi nahi rahati or ve maut kaa swaagat karne ko taiyaar ho jate hai to unka ilaaj dhanvantari bhi nahin kar sakate
 This girl has a ghost on her mind that she will no longer be good
 kya uske man par koi boj he?" Soo said, "nothing else, but he has a strong desire to paint the Bay of Naples every day
" " "chitra? Hoon! i was asking, is there any attraction in his life that intensifies the desire to live? Like a young man!" bichchhu ke dank kii-si chubhti aawaaj main su boli," noujvaan? purush or prem-chodo bhi-nahin doctor sahab, ansi koi baat nahin he
 " doctor bolaa,"sari buraai kii jad yahi he
 According to medical education, i will not leave without doing what is possible
 par jab koi marij apni arthi ke saath chalane waalon kii sankhya ginaney laga jaataa he tab dawaaiyon kii shakti aadhi rah jaati he
 If you can create any attraction in her life, due to which she starts discussing about the fashion of clothes that are prevalent in the next winter, then her chances of living will be at least double
 " After the doctor left, Suu went to her room and she wept and squeezed several handkerchiefs
 kuch der baad, chitrakaari kaa saamaan lekar, vah siti bajaati hui jansi ke kamare main pahunchi
 Jansi, clad in a cloak, stared silently, looking at the window
 use soi hui jaan kar usne siti bajaanaa band kar diya
 Putting paper on the planks, she sat down to draw a picture with pen ink for the story of a magazine
 navdith kalakaaron ko 'kala' kii manzil tak pahunchane keliye, patrikaon ke liye tasviren banani hi padati he
 For example, to reach the destination of literature, budding writers have to write stories in magazines
 jyon hi su, ek ghudsavaar jaisaa brijas pahane, ek aankh kaa chashma lagaaye, kisi idaho ke gadhriye ke chitra kii rekhaaen banane lagi ki use ek dhimi aawaaj anek baar duharaati-si sunai di
 She soon went to the sick bed
 jansi kii ankhe khuli thim
 She was looking out of the window and talking some count
 lekin vah ulta jap kar rahi thi
 She said, "twelve" then "eleven" then "ten" and "nine" and then together "eight" and "seven"
 su ne utkantha se, khidki ke baahar najar daali
 What was worth counting there
 ek khulaa, banjar chowk yaa bees fit dur eenton ke makaan kii kori diwaar! An old, snooty, inlaid, protruding
 The evergreen vine was halfway up the wall
 shishir kii thandi saanso ne uske sharir kii pattiyaan tod lee thim or uski kankal shakhaaen, ekadam ughadi, un tuuti-phuti iton se latak rahi thim
 Soo asked, "what is Jani?" atyant dhime swaron main jansi boli,"chha:! ab ve jaldi-jaldi gir rahi hai
 Three days ago there were about one hundred
 unhen ginate-ginate sir dukhane lagaataa tha
 She fell one more
 ab bachi sirf paanch
 " "paanch kya? jaani, paanch kya? apni su ko to bataa!" "leaves
 us bel kii pattiyaan
 The moment the last leaf falls, i too will leave
 mujhe teen din se iskaa pataa he
 Didn't the doctor tell you? " atyant tiraskaar ke saath su ne shikaayat kii, "oh! itani bevakoof to kahin nahi dekhi
 How is your recovery related to these leaves? You used to love that bull - why? naughty! Close your stupidity! Just this morning, the doctor told that the possibility of your recovery - where exactly were the words - said yes, the possibility is fourteen rupees and in New York, when we sit in a taxi or a new building
 Pass through, even then the possibility of living is no more than this
 ab thodaa shorwa pine kii koshish kar or apni su ko tasviir banane de, taaki use sampadak mahoday ke haathon bech kar vah apane biimaar bacchee ke liye thodi dawa-daaru or apane khud ke pet ke liye kuch roti-pani laa sake
 " apni ankhon ko khidki ke baahar tikaaye jansi boli,"tumhen ab mere liye sharaab laane kii jarurat nahin
 She fell one more
 nahin mujhe shorwe kii bhi jarurat nahin
 Now only four are left
 andheraa hone se pahile us aakhri pattee ko girte hue dekh luun-bas
 Then i will also leave
 " Soo bowed down on her, 'dear Jansi! You must promise that you will keep your eyes closed and will not look out of the window while i work
 kal tak ye tasviir pahunchaa deni hai
 i need light, or else close the window now
 " Jansi asked Rukhai, "can't you sit in another room and make pictures?" su ne kaha,"mujhe tere paas hi rahanaa chahiye
 Also, i do not want to let you look at that vine
 " Like a fallen idol, immaculate and white, closing his eyes, Jansi said, "speak to me as soon as i am finished, because i want to see that last leaf fall
 ab apni har pakad ko dhilaa chhodana chaahati hum or un bichaari thakee hui pattiyon kii tarah tairti hui neeche-neeche-neeche chalijana chaahati hum
 " su ne kaha," tu sone kii koshish kar
 i call that Behrman to be a laborer in the mine
 abhi, ek minute main aayi
 Don't move until i return! " boodha beharman unke neeche hi ek kamare main rahata tha
 He was also a painter
 uski umr saath saal se bhi adhik thi
 His beard, like the mosaic beard of Michael Angelo's picture, seemed to be waving from the head of a rogue monkey to the body of a ghost
 berahamam ek asafal kalakaar tha
 He had been doing meditation for forty years, but had not even touched the stage of his art yet
 vah har tasviir ko banaate samay yahi sochataa ki yah uski utkrasht krati hogi, par kabhi bhi waisi bana nahin paata
 Here, for many years, he had left this business, except making commercial or advertising pictures
 un navayuvak kalakaaron ke liye mandal banakar, jo kisi peshewar mandal kii fis nahin chukaa sakate the, vah aajkal apana pet bharta tha
 He would drink too much alcohol and talk nonsense about his masterpiece, which he cherished
 vaise vah bada khoonkhaar boodha tha, jo namr aadamiyon kii joardaar majaak udaata or apane ko in donon jawan kalakaaron kaa paharedaar kutta samajha karata
 Soo finds Behrman lying in his dark base
 usamen se ber kii guthliyon-si gandh aa rahi thi
 In one corner stood the blank blanket, which had been waiting for twenty-five years to mark the first line of his illustrious art
 usne buudhe ko bataaya ki kaise jansi un patton ke saath apane pattey jaise komal sharir kaa sambandh jod kar, unke samaan bah jane kii bhaybheet kalpana karti he or sochati he ki uski pakad sansar par dhili ho jaayegi
 The old Behrman angrily expressed his disdain at these foolish fantasies
 vah bolaa,"kya kaha? kya abhi tak duniya main aanse murkh bhi hai, jo sirf isliye ki ek ukhdi hui bel se pattey jhad rahe hai, apane marane kii kalpana kar lete he? maine to aansa kahin nahin suna! main tumhaare jaise bevakoof paaglon ke liye kabhi model nahin ban saktaa
 How did you allow this thing to enter your mind? Hey, Bachari Jansi! " su ne kaha,"vah beemaari se bahut kamjor ho gayi he or bukhaar ke kaaran hi uske dimag main ansi ajeeb-ajeeb kalushit kalpanaaen jaag uthi hai
 good; Old Behrman, don't be me if you don't want to be a model for me
 ho to aakhir ullu ke patthe hi!" Berhman shouted, "you are a girl's girl! Who said i will not be a model? Come, i go with you
" aadhe ghante se yahi to zinc rahaa hum ki bhai chalata hum-chalata hu! lekin ek baat kahuun- yah jagah jansi jaisi acchhee ladki ke marane laayak nahin he
 Someday, when i create my masterpiece, then we will all walk from here
 samajhi? haa!" When they reached the top, Jancy was sleeping
 su ne khidakiyon ke parde gira diye or beharman ko duusare kamare main le gayi
 From there they looked at the vine outside the window with frightened eyes
 fir unhone, bina ek bhi shabd bole, ek-duusare kii ore dekha
 The cold rainy snowfall was falling continuously with him
 ek ketli ko ulta karke us par neeli kameez main beharman ko bithaaya gaya jisase chattan par baithe huye, kisi khan ke majdoor kaa model ban jaye
 After an hour's sleep, when Suu's eyes opened in the morning on the second day, he saw that Jansi was rooting, tearing her eyes towards the green curtain of the window
 surasurahat ke swar main usne aadesh diya,"parde uthaa de, mai dekhnaa chaahati hum
 " vivash hokar su ko ajna manani padi
 But what is this! Even after rain, thunderstorms and snow fall overnight, there was a leaf in the vine, which was attached to the brick wall
 apane danthal ke paas kuch gahari hari, lekin apane kinaaron ke aasapaas thakaavat or or jhadane kii ashanka liye pili-pili, vah pattee jameen se koi bees foot oonchi abhi tak apni daali se latakarhi thi
 Jansy said, "this is the last
 maine sochaa tha ki yah raat main jarur hi gir jaaygi
 i also heard the sound of the storm
 khayr, koi baat nahin yah aaj gir jaayegi or usee samay main bhi mar jaaungin
 " takiye par apana thakaa hua cheharaa jhukaa kar su boli,"kya kahati he pagal! apana nahin to kam se kam meraa khyaal kar! main kya karuungi?" But Jansi did not respond
 is duniya kii sabase akeli vastu yah 'aatma' he, jab vah apni rahasyamayi lambi yatra par jane kii taiyaari main hoti he
 As the world and its bondage bound by friendship began to loosen, its imagination began to push it harder
 din biit gaya or sandhya ke ksheen prakaash main bhi, diwaar se lagi hui bel se lataka hua vah patta, unhen dikhaai detaa rahaa
 But just as night fell, the northern winds started moving again and the rain fell on the balcony, hitting the window
 roshni hote hi nirdayee jansi ne aadesh diya ki parde uthaa diye jaye
 The leaf was still present in the vine
 jansi bahut der tak usee ko ekatak dekhati rahi
 He called Suu, who was making chicken broth on the stove in the foursome
 jansi boli,"sudi, main bahut hi kharaab ladki hum
 Some power of nature, stopping that last leaf right there, told me how wicked i am
 is tarah maranaa to paap he
 La, give me some broth and mix some milk with poison
 par nahin, usase pehle mujhe jaraa sheesha de or mere sirahaane kuch takiye laga, taaki main baithe-baithe tuje khaanaa banaate hue dekh sakuun
 " koi ek ghannte baad vah boli,"sudi, mujhe lagata he ki main kabhi na kabhi neples kii khadi kaa chitra jarur banaaungi
 " shaam ko doctor sahab fir aaye su, kuch bahaanaa banaakar, unase baahar jaakar mili
 Taking the weakly trembling hand in his hands, Dr
 Sahib said, "now the possibility can be considered eight
 agar paricharya acchhee hui to tum jeet jaaogi or ab main, neeche kii manzil par, ek-duusare marij ko dekhne ja rahaa hum
 What is his name- Behrman! - May be an artist - has pneumonia
 atyant durbal or bura aadmi he or jhapat jor kii lagi he
 No chance of survival
 aaj use aspataal bhijwan duungaa
 There will be more rest
 " The other day the doctor told Soo, "jansi, now out of danger
 tumhaari jeet hui
 Now, only diet and care is needed
 " In the evening that day, Suu came and sat near Jansi's bed
 vah neeli oon kaa ek bekaar-sa gulband, nishcint hokar bun rahi thi
 He put his arm in Soo's neck, from that side of the pillow
 su boli,"meri bholi billi, tujhse ek baat kehani he
 In the hospital this morning, Mr
 Behrman died of pneumonia
 vah sirf do roj biimaar rahaa
 The day after morning, the watchman found him in his room suffering from pain
 uske kapade-yahaan tak ki juute bhi puri tarah se bhiige hue or barf ke samaan thande ho rahe the
 Nobody knows where he went on such a terrible night
 lekin uske kamare se ek jalati hui laalaten, ek nasahni, do-chaar brush or falak par kuch haraa or pilaa rang milaayaa hua mila
 Just look out of the window and see the last leaf near the wall
 kya tuje kabhi aashcharya nahin hua ki itani aandhi or toofaan main bhi vah pattee hilti kyon nahin? pyaari sakhi, yahi beharman kii utkrasht kalakrati thi jis raat ko antim pattee giri usee raat usne uskaa nirmaan kiya tha
