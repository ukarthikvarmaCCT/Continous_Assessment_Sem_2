 Blackjack is the most widely played casino banking game in the world, also known as twenty-one, wing-at-un, or Pontoon
 is maanak khel ko 52 card vaale ek yaa adhik angrez-america deck ke saath khelaa jaataa he
 The basic rules of this game include adding the value of the first two cards in hand from the twenty-one cards being distributed
 yadi ikkis se kam ke mulya ke card baante jate hai, to khilaadi tab tak single cardon ke saath khilne kaa chayan kar saktaa he jab tak vah ikkis ke mulya tak yaa us mulya tak nahin pahunch jaataa jab vah khud ko khilne ke laayak mahasoos kare, yaa us mulya tak pahunch jaae jiskaa maan ikkis se adhik ho
 The winner must have a card with a value equal to or equal to one without exceeding the value of twenty one
 is khel ko casino main vibhinn teble niyamon ke saath vibhinn roopon main khelaa jaataa he
 Blackjack has gained a lot of popularity due to the mix of opportunities, skills and promotions associated with card counting
 casino khel ko lekar british card game blike jaik ke saath bhramit nahin hona chahie
 Blackjack's precursor was "twenty-one", an unknown original game
 sabase pehla likhit sandarbh miguel de servantes kii ek pustak main miltaa he, jo apni anya rachanaaon main se don kigjot ke lekhan ke liye kaaphi prasiddh he
 Cervantes himself was a gambler and from "novel's Ejemplairs", the main character of his story "rinconet y Cortadillo" is a duo working in Seville
 ve "venteuna" main dhokhaa dene main maahir he or kehete hai ki khel kaa uddeshy bina ank khoe 21 ank praapt karnaa he or yah bhi kehete hai ki ikke kaa maan 1 yaa 11 he
 The game is played with the Spanish Barja, which does not contain eight, nine and ten digit cards
 is laghu katha kaa lekhan 1601 or 1602 ke bich hui thi or to is khel ko 17veen sadi ke armbh se yaa usase pehle castila main khelaa jaataa tha
 Later references to this game are found in France and Spain
 jab sanyukt rani america main 21 kii shuruyaat kii gai thi us samay yah lokapriy nahin tha, isliye jue ke addon ne teble par khilaadiyon ko jamaa karne ke liye bonus ke taur par alag-alag rakam kii peshkash karne kaa prayaas kiya
 One such bonus was a payout of 10 to 1 if the player had an ace of spades in his hand and a black jack
 is daanv ko "blackjaik" kaha jaataa tha or is tarah yah naam is khel ke saath jud gaya, yahaan tak ki bahut jald is bonus bhugtan ke samaapt ho jane ke baad bhi yah kaayam rahaa
 In modern games, a "natural" or "blackjack" is simply a ten-digit card with one aces
 ek casino main blackjaik main, ek chaap ke aakaar ke teble ke peeche se dealer ke saamne ek se saat khilaadi rahete hai
 Each player freely makes his move against the dealer
 prayek daur kii shuruyaat main, khilaadi "betting box" main ek daanv lagaataa he or do cardon kaa ek aarambhik chaal praapt karata he
 The objective of the game is to get cards with a value greater than the value of the dealer's hand cards, but not to exceed 21, which is called "busting" or "breaking"
 2 se 10 tak kii sankhya vaale cardon kaa maan utana hi hota he jitna us par mudrit hota he; jaik, begum or badshaah kaa maan 10 hota he; ikke kaa maan khilaadi kii pasand ke anusaar 1 yaa 11 ho saktaa he
 The player makes the first move and plays the cards in his hand by adding additional cards as he wishes
 yadi vah 21 ank se upar chalaa jaataa he to vah "vifal" ho jaataa he or vah apane aap apni chaal or baaji haar jaataa he
 Then the dealer makes his move
 yadi dealer vifal hota he, to vah un sabhi shesh khilaadiyon se haar jaataa he jinke paas 21 se kam yaa uske samakaksh maan vaali card he
 If no one fails, the player holding the cards with the most points wins
 yadi kisi khilaadi kaa dealer ke saath gathbandhan ho jaataa he, to chaal ko aage badhaayaa jaataa he jise tehraav ke naam se janaa jaataa he or khilaadi ke daanv ko lautaa diya jaataa he 
 It is possible that the dealer loses to some players but still he beats other players in the same round
 taash kii cardon ko teen tarah se baanta jaataa he, ek yaa do haath vaale deck se, chaar se aath deck vaale ek box se, yaa ek shafling mashin se
 jab haath se cardon ko baanta jaataa he, to khilaadi ke do aarambhik card aam taur par phase-down hoti hai, jabaki dealer ke paas ek phase-ap card hoti he jise "apcard" kehete hai or ek phase-down card hota he jise "hole card" kehete hai
 When cards are dealt with a shoe, the cards distributed to all players are typically face-up with very few exceptions
 gaiyr-visheshgy khilaadi ke liye aisi koi baat nahin honi chahie ki uske cardon ko phase-down yaa phase-ap rup main baanta gaya he kyonki dealer ko purvanirdhaarit niyamon ke anusaar hi khelnaa padataa he
 If the dealer has a card with a value less than 17, it should be hit
 yadi dealer ke paas 17 yaa usase adhik maan vaale card hon, to use tab tak rukna chahie, jab tak iskaa maan ek "soft 17" nahin ho jaataa he 
 With a soft 17 the dealer follows the casino rules printed on the blackjack table to "hit soft 17" or to "stand on all 17"
 aam taur par, adhiktam sambhavit hand ek "blackjaik" yaa "naichural" he, jiskaa matlab kul 21 maanon vaala ek aarambhik do card he
 The player to whom the blackjack is dealt wins automatically, if the dealer does not even have blackjack, in which case the hand is a "push"
 jab dealer kaa apcard ek ikkaa hota he, to khilaadi ko alag se daanv lagane kii anumati di jaati he jise "insurance" kehete hai, jo kathith taur par jokhim kii raksha karata he ki dealer ke paas ek blackjaik he
 Insurance bets pay 2 to 1 if the dealer has a blackjack
 jab kabhi dealer ke paas ek blackjaik hota he, vah un khilaadiyon ko chhodkar baaki sabhi khilaadiyon se jeet jaataa he jinke paas bhi ek blackjaik hota he
 The minimum and maximum bets are placed on the table
 adhikansh daanv kii adaayagi 1:1 hoti he jiskaa matlab yah he ki khilaadi utana hi rakam jeetta he jitne rakam kaa vah daanv lagaataa he
 The traditional payout of a player blackjack is 3: 2 which means that the casino pays $ 3 for every $ 2 bet, but in today's times many casinos pay less at some tables
 apane aarambhik do cardon ko praapt karne ke baad khilaadi ko chaar maanak vikalp praapt hote hai: vah "hit", "stand", "dabl down," yaa "split e peyar" kaa chayan kar saktaa he
 Each option requires the use of a hand signal
 kuch casino yaa tablon par, khilaadi ko ek paanchvaan vikalp mil saktaa he, jise "aatmasamarpan" kehete hai
 The player is usually allowed to "double down for lace", allowing him to place a lower bet than the original bet next to it in the betting box, although this is generally not a good idea because the player The person should double his bet only in favorable circumstances but after that he should increase his bet as much as possible
 iske vipareet, koi khilaadi mul daanv ke mulya se adhik dabl down nahin kar saktaa he
 ) haath ke sanketon kaa istemaal "ai in da ski" kii sahaayta karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo teble ke upar sthit lekin ek-tarfaa kaanch ke peeche chhipe hua ek vyakti yaa video camera he
 This device is used to protect casinos from cheating dealers or players
 iskaa istemaal card ganakon se casino kii raksha karne ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki card kii ginati sanyukt rajya america main gaiyr kanoonee nahin he
 The player can take as many hits as he wants as long as the total in his hand does not exceed Hard-20
 However, if he fails, he loses that hand
 jab sabhi khilaadi nirnay kar lete hai, tab dealer apane hole card ko dikhataa he or purvanirdhaarit niyamon ke anusaar apana haath kheltaa he
 a blackjack player may face a variety of different rules that affect the house advantage and therefore his chances of winning
 kuch niyamon kaa nirdhaaran kaanoon yaa vinium ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he, anya niyamon kaa nirdhaaran khud casino ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Not all rules apply, so the player may have to ask about these rules before playing his hand or when the time comes
 100 se adhik vibhinn niyam maujuud hai
 As far as all casino games are concerned, blackjack includes a "house advantage" or "house edge"
 blackjaik main praathmik house adwantage is tathy se niklaa he ki yadi khilaadi vifal hota he to vah haar jaataa he, chaahe dealer ant main vifal ho yaa na ho
 However, a blackjack player using a bunny strategy will actually lose less than 1 percent of the total amount of all his bets with an average fortune; Compared to other casino games, it is very favorable for the player
 agyanta kii vajah se buniyadi ranneeti se vichlit hone vaale khilaadiyon ke haani dar ke aam taur par adhik hone kii ummid rahati he
 Each casino has a rule of whether the dealer hits soft 17, the rule itself is printed on the table
 "es17" khel main, dealer sabhi 17 par stand karata he
 In the "H17" game, the dealer hits a soft 17
 beshak, dealer hameshaa hard 17 par stand karata he
 In any case, the dealer has no choice; He must either hit definitely or he must not hit
 The "hit soft 17" game is less suited to the player whose house advantage is more than 0
2%
 prayukt dex kii sankhya kaa khilaadiyon ke jeetne ke maukey par pramukh prabhaav padataa he, kyonki yah house adwantage ko prabhavit karata he
 All things being equal, some decks are always more suited to the player adopting basic strategy
 iskaa ek kaaran yah he ki khilaadi blackjaik single deck blackjaik se thodaa bahut samaan hota he ko hataa diya jaataa he or kaaphi had tak ek alag tarah ke card ko liya jaataa he - or ek multi-deck khel kii tulana main ek single deck khel main kaaphi zyada asar padataa he) or yadi khilaadi ke paas blackjaik hota he, to dealer ke paas bhi blackjaik hone kii kaaphi kam sambhaavna rahati he, jiskaa matlab yah he ki single deck khel main khilaadi ko sankhyikeey kii drushti se aksar 3:2 ke anupaat main bhugtan kiya janaa chahie
 When single deck blackjack is offered, it is generally offered with more restrictive rules that suit the house
 nidarshi prayojanon ke liye, nimnaankit sabhi sankhyikeey ek samaan niyamon kaa istemaal karte hai: split ke baad dabl, ikkon ko split karne ke liye ek card, koi aatmasamarpan nahin, kisi bhi do cardon par dabl, keval dealer ke blackjaik par haare gaye mul daanv, dealer dwaara soft 17 ko hit karnaa or istemaal kiya gaya cat-card
 single deck khel dabl deck se bahut behatar hota he, jo chaar dekon se kaaphi behatar hota he, jabaki chah yaa usase adhik deck se isamen bahut kam antar hota he
 Some casinos offer a favorable option known as "surrender" or surrender, which allows the player to give up half his wager and not play his hand
 is vikalp ko kabhi-kabhi "let" sarender yaa vilamb aatmasamarpan ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he kyonki yah tab hota he jab dealer ek blackjaik ke liye apane hole card kii jaanch kar letaa / leti he
 When the casino was first open in Atlantic City, this surrender or surrender option was available before the dealer checked for blackjack - this rule was very beneficial to the player - but this option of "initial surrender" soon disappeared
 
 aarambhik aatmasamarpan ke vibhinn rup aaj bhi kai deshon main maujuud hai
 The player must surrender only on very poor hands, because even if there is a 25 percent chance of winning, he can get a higher average return than leaving half his bet
 armbh main aatmasamarpan kar dene se dealer ke ikke ke saamne ek khilaadi ke aatmasamarpan kii zyada sambhaavna rahati he
 If the player splits or separates a pair of cards other than equations and a third card of that value or value appears, the player can usually split again by placing another bet equal to the original bet
 to teble par teen daanv lagenge or teen alag-alag haath khele jaaenge
 kuch casino ikkon ke alaava kisi anya cardon kii aseemit risplitting kii anumati dete hai, jabaki anya casino khele jane vaale haathon kii ek nishchit sankhya, jaise - chaar haath tak ise simit kar sakate hai
 After splitting the aces, a common rule is that only one card will be dealt for each aces; The player cannot split, double, or take another hit on either hand
 niyam ke vibhinn roopon main khilaadi ko split ikkon ko phir se split karne yaa hit karne kii anumati dena shaamil he
 Allowing the player to hit hands with split aces reduces the casino edge by about 0
13 percent; Allowing split aces to split again reduces the edge by about 0
03 percent
 haalanki ikkon ko phir se split karnaa bahut aam he, isliye khilaadi ko split ikkon ko hit karne kii anumati dene vaale house atyant durlabh hote hai
 After a player splits a pair of cards, most casinos allow him to "double down" on both or one of the new two-card hands
 ise "dabl after split" kaha jaataa he or yah khilaadi ko lagbhag 0
12 pratishat laabh pradaan karata he
 This rule, often called the Reno Rule, restricts the player from double-downing only on an initial player of the number 10 or 11
 yah soft hands jaise - soft 17 par dabl karne se roktaa he or yah khilaadi ke liye anukool nahin hota he
 This increases the House Advantage between 0
09% and 0
15% for the 9–11 rule and 0
17% and 0
26% for the 10–11 rule
 anya niyamon ke parsparik prabhaav kii vajah se in sankhyaon main bhinnata aa sakati he
 In most non-american casinos, a 'no hole card' game is played, which means that the dealer does not draw or consult his second card until all players have decided
 no hold card ke saath, shaayad kabhi dealer ke dahale yaa ikke ke khilaaf dabl yaa split karne kii sahi buniyadi ranneeti nahin he, kyonki dealer ke blackjaik kii vajah se split or dabl daanv kii haani ho sakati he; iskaa ekmaatr apwaad dealer ke ek dahale ke khilaaf ek joda ikkaa he, jahaan split karnaa abhi bhi sahi hota he
 In all other cases, a stand, hit or surrender is called
 udhaaharan ke liye, dealer ke 10 ke khilaaf 11 rakhkar, sahi ranneeti ek hole card khel main dabl karnaa he, na ki ek no hold card khel main hit karnaa
 The no hole card rule leads to a house edge increase of about 0
11 percent
 kuch sthanon main, jaise australia or newzealand main kuch casino main, yadi baad main pataa chalata he ki dealer ke paas blackjaik he to khilaadi keval apana mul daanv, na ki atirikt daanv haar jaataa he
 It has the same basic strategy and the same advantage that a hold card game has
 bahut se casino main, aam taur par sabase kam teble minimums or single deck khelon ke teble main, ek blackjaik saamaanya 3:2 ke bajaay keval 6:5 yaa 1:1 kaa bhi bhugtan karata he
 In the US common rule changes, these changed payouts for blackjack are the most harmful to the player, leading to the largest increase in house edge
 chunki blackjaik haathon ke lagbhag 4
8 pratishat main hota he, isliye 1:1 khel house age main 2
3 pratishat tak kii vruddhi kar detaa he jabaki 6:5 khel se house age main 1
4 pratishat kii badhat hoti he
 1: 1 payment for video blackjack is a major reason why it has never reached the table version in terms of popularity
 single deck khelon main teble blackjaik par sabase adhik aam taur par 6:5 niyam ko lagu kiya jaataa he - jo anya prakaar se ek buniyadi ranneeti khilaadi ke liye sabase zyada aakarshak khel hota he
 Allowing the dealer to win all push hands is catastrophic for the player
 yadhyapi shaayad hi kabhi maanak blackjaik main istemaal hone vaale is khel ko kabhi-kabhi "blackjaik kii tarah" ke khelon main jaise kuch charity casino main dekha jaataa he
 If the dealer's upcard is an ace, the player is given the option to take insurance before the dealer checks his 'hole card'
 insurance teble ke ek vishesh bhaag main lagaae gaye mul daanv ke aadhe daanv tak alag se lagaaya jane vaala daanv he jise aam taur par "insurance pez 2 tu 1" ke rup main chihnit kiya jaataa he
 This side bet is offered when the dealer's displayed card is an ace
 dharna yah he ki dealer ke duusare card ke dahala hone kii bahut zyada sambhaavna rahati he jo dealer ko ek blackjaik detaa he or iske parinamswaroop praayah nishchit rup se khilaadi haar jaataa he
 
 yah ek "insurance" daanv lagaakar is sambhaavna ko bhanjane ke liye khilaadi ko aakarshith karata he, jo 1 par 2 ke hisaab se bhugtan karata he yadi dealer ke paas ek blackjaik hota he, jis maamle main "insurance se praapt aay" mul daanv kii sahavarti ghate kii bharpai karegaa
 Insurance bets are incurred when the dealer does not have blackjack, although the player can still win or lose on the original bet
 insurance us khilaadi ke liye ek bahut hi karaab daanv ban jaataa he jab vah card kii ginati nahin kar rahaa hota he, kyonki, ek anant deck main, 13 main se card kaa maan das hota he or isliye shesh 9 kaa maan das nahin hota he, to is tarah ek anant deck khel kaa saidhantik pratifal 4 / 13 * 2 * daanv - 9 / 13 * daanv = -1 / 13 * daanv, yaa -7
69% hota he
 In practice, the average house edge will be less than this, as even excluding a non-ten card from the shoe causes the dealer to proportionate the remaining cards with values greater than ten
 phir bhi, aamtaur par daanv se parhez kiya jaataa he, kyonki house kaa everej age us vaqt bhi 7 pratishat se adhik hota he
 The player counting the cards can count the remaining ten in the shoe and only make insurance bets when he has an edge
 Also, in a multihand single deck game, insurance can be a good bet if the player is not
 He looks at the other cards in the table - for an initial hand, if the dealer has an ace, there are 51 cards left in the deck, 16 of which are ten
 haalanki, agar kam se kam 2 khilaadi khel rahe hon or unamem se kisi kaa bhi do aarambhik card ten na hon, to shesh 47 cardon main se 16 card ten hote hai - jo 3 main 1 se behatar hote hai, jo insurance daanv ko ek acha daanv banaate hai
 When the player has a blackjack and the dealer has an ace, insurance bets can be offered as an "equal amount" which means that the player's blackjack is immediately dealt with 1: 1 before the dealer's hand is checked
 payment is made
 'sam raashi' bas ek thodaa sa alag daanv he; antar yah he ki sam raashi kii peshkash na kiye jane kii sthiti main blackjaik ko insor karne ke liye khilaadi ke paas paryaapt dhan hona chahie
 Taking an equal amount is usually a bad option because one of the two cards of the player is a ten card, so the proportion of the remaining tens in the deck is less
 casino main jahaan ek hole card baanta jaataa he, vahaan ikke yaa dahale kii tarah ke maan vaale card ko dikhne vaala ek dealer apane paas blackjaik ke hone yaa na hone kii jaanch karne ke liye tebletop par ek chote darpan yaa electronic sensor par apane hole card ke kone ko khiskaa saktaa he
 This practice reduces the risk of the hold card being inadvertently visible, allowing the sharp-eyed player to benefit greatly from it
 kuch casino apane blackjaik khelon ke saath ek bagali daanv kii peshkash karte hai
 Examples of this include side bets, three card poker style bets, a pair card and many more depending on the three bets
 bagali daanv ke liye, aam taur par khilaadi apane mukhya daanv ke saath ek atirikt daanv laga saktaa he or is bagali daanv ko haar yaa jeet saktaa he jis par uske mukhya khel ke parinaam se koi fark nahin padataa he
 The house edge of side bets is generally much higher than the house edge of the main game
 ek single-box khel main her-pher ke baad pehle hand ke ishtatam khilaadi faislon ke sampoorn set ko buniyadi ranneeti ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Basic strategy is also the optimal game for a player unaware of the cards shown since the final reshuffle

 The origin of Karun is also possible from Raudra, terrible, Shringar, wonderful and heroic and terrible
 vastut: bharat kaa abhimath spasht nahin he
 After him, Dhananjaya considered the four stages of the mind as growth, expansion, disturbance and deflection, adornment and humor as growth, heroic and wonderful as expansion, disturbing and terrible as distraction and raudra and Karun related to deflection
 kintu jo vidvan keval druti, vistaar tathaa vikaas naamak teen hi avasthaaen maanate hai unka is vargeekaran se samaadhaan na hoga
 Similarly, if we consider the fluid state of the mind in Shringar, its expansion in humor and the wonderful, its brilliance in Veer and Raudra, and its hesitation in the horrors and the terrible, then even Bharata's order is not right
 ek sthiti ke saath duusari sthiti kii upasthiti bhi asambhav nahin he
 Deepti and Karun have both druti and hesitation with detail in the wonderful and heroic
 phir bhi bharatkrut sambandh sthaapan se itnaa sanket avashya miltaa he ki kathith rason main paraspar upakaarkarta vidyaman he or ve ek duusare ke mitra tathaa sahachaari hai
 Like friendship, the opposition of these juices has also been imagined according to the situation
 kis rasvishesh ke saath kin anya rason kaa turant varnan aswaad main baadhak hoga, yah virombhavna isi vichaar par aadhaarit he
 Of Shringar from Karun, Bibhatsa, Raudra, Veer and Bhavya; Horrible and compassionate to comic; Karun with humor and adornment; Of humor, adornment and terrible of raudra; Shringar, Veer, Raudra, of humor and the terrible of calm; From the terrifying and serene to the heroic; Veer, adornment, raudra, humor and gruesome calm are considered opposites
 yah virodh aashray aikya, alamban aikya athwa nairantary ke kaaran upasthit hota he
 There is a possibility of this opposition in the management poetry itself
 muktak main prasang kii chand ke saath hi samaapti ho jane se iskaa bhay nahin rahata he
 The writer should avoid the presence of anti-rasam from the presence of the antagonistic juices and the alarms separately or by presenting the friendly juice of the two between the two opposing rasas or by presenting the amaranth of angras rather than the principal rasa
 
 ras kii aswadaniyata kaa vichaar karte hue use brahmanand sahodar, swaprakashanand, vilakshan aadi bataaya jaataa he or is aadhaar par sabhi rason ko anandatmak mana gaya he
 Bhattnayak has indicated the beauty of all the juices by showing mritva-paratva-inferior condition due to Sattvodrak, Abhinavagupta, Nirvigna's realization and Anandavardhan stating the state of melody and humidity in Karuna as Shringar, Vipralambha and Karuna progressively flourishing
 kintu anukoolvedaniyata tathaa pratikulvedaniyata ke aadhaar par bhaavon kaa vivechan karke rudrabhatt ramchandra gunachandra, haripal, tathaa dhananjay ne or hindi main acharya ramchandra shukla ne rason kaa sukhaatmak tathaa du:khaatmak anubhuthavaala mana he
 Abhinavagupta had first introduced the theory of "sukhu: Khasbhavono Ras:" in "abhinavabharati"
 sukhaatmak rason main shringaar, vir, hasya, adbhut tathaa shant kii or du:khaatmak main karun, raudra, bibhats tathaa bhayanak kii gananaa kii gai
 By giving the example of "pancaras", it has been proved that in the Panc juice made by mixing jaggery, Mirich etc
, there is a peculiar kind of taste, not knowing the sour sweetness of different items, it is also said that that picture In the same way, in a proportionate way, sometimes sour, sometimes hard, and so on, the taste of other types comes
 madhusudan saraswati kaa kathan he ki raj athwa tam kii apeksha satv ko pradhan maan lene par bhi yah to maananaa hi chahie ki anshat: unka bhi aswaad bana rahata he
 Acharya Shukla is of the opinion that the feeling we have is of the described sense and the expressions are of a dry, sadistic nature, etc
 Therefore, the rasa will also be of both types
 duusari ore rason ko anandatmak maanane ke pakshpaati sahrudayon ko hi iskaa praman maanate hai or tark kaa sahaara lete hai ki du:khadaayi vastu bhi yadi apni priy he to sukhadaayi hi prathit hoti he
 For example, at the time of the night, a woman feels pain in her body, but at that time she considers it a pleasure
 bhoj tathaa vishwanath kii is dharna ke atirikt swayan madhusudan saraswati rason ko loukik bhaavon kii anubhuti se bhinn or vilakshan maanakar inaki anandatmakataa kaa samarthan karte he or abhinavgupt vitvighnaprathit vatakar is dharna ko spasht karte hai ki usee bhav kaa anubhav bhi yadi bina vichlit hue or kisi bahari athwa antarodbhoot antaraay ke bina kiya jaataa he to vah sahya hone ke kaaran anandatmak hi kehalaata he
 If you consider it to be sorrowful, then consider the distinction of adornment as sad as well, then why should the distinction of adornment be considered sorrowful? By giving many such arguments, the conformity of the juices is proved
 angreji main tragedy se milanevaale anand kaa bhi anek prakaar se samaadhaan kiya gaya he or marathi lekhakon ne bhi rason kii aanandarupata ke sambandh main paryaapt bhinn dharanaayen prastut kii hai
 Often, the notion of considering Ras as the same in the traditional form has been prevalent, considering the different names of the juices as official or formal authority
 bharat ne "na hi rasaadrute kashchidpyarth : pravartat" pankti main "ras" shabd kaa ek vachan main prayog kiya he or abhinavgupt ne uparilikhit dharna vyakt kii he
 Bhoja has treated Shringar as the only juice and has always interpreted it differently, according to Vishwanath, Narayan Pandit considers the miraculous miracle to be the only juice, because miracle is the form
 bhawabhooti ne karun ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar usee se sabaki utpatti bataai he or bharat ke "swan swan nimittamasadya shantadbhav: pravartate, punarnimittapaye c shant evopaliyate" - vaktavy ke aadhaar par shant ko hi ekmaatr ras mana ja saktaa he
 Similarly, on the basis of the server-friendly state of excitement and amazement, they can also be considered at the root of all other juices
 ras aswaad or anand ke rup main ek akhand anubhuti maatr hai, yah ek paksh he or ek hi ras se anya rason kaa udbhav hua he yah doosraa paksh he
 In the idea of rasapradhanya, the problem of rajrajata has arisen
 bharat samast shuchi, ujwal, medhya or dalneey ko shringaar maanate hai, "agnipurana" shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras bataakar anya sabko usee ke bhed maanata he, bhoj shringaar ko hi mul or ekmaatr ras maanate hai, parantu uplabdh likhit pramaan ke aadhaar par "rasraj" shabd kaa prayog "ujjvalaneelamani" main bhakthiras ke liye hi dikhaai detaa he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas considers Shringar to be the origin of all Rasas and Rasavayak Dev
 "rasraj" sangya kaa shringaar ke liye prayog matiram dwaara hi kiya gaya miltaa he
 On the other hand, Banarasidas declares "navamo Sant Rasani Ko Nayak" in the play "samayasara"
 rasarajata kii sweekruti vyapaktaa, utkar aswadyata, anya rason ko antarbhoot karne kii kshamta sabhi sanchaariyon tathaa saatvikon ko ant:saat karne kii shakti sarvapranisulabhtv tathaa shighragrahyata aadi par nirbhar he
 All these things are found in as much and strong makeup, not in other juices
 at: rasraj vahi kehalaata he
 Raso's king Shringar Ras is considered vichaarco ne raudra tathaa karun ko chhodkar shesh rason kaa bhi varnan kiya he
 The most detailed description of these is that of dressing
 shringaar mukhyat: sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he, kintu dhananjay aadi kuch vidvan vipralambh ke purvanurag bhed ko sanyog-vipralambh-virahit purvavastha maanakar ayog kii sangya dete hai tathaa shesh viprayog tathaa sambhog naam se do bhed or karte hai
 On the basis of many circumstances of coincidence, it is considered to be invisible and it is distinguished only by the idea of asylum, heroic or amphibious, disguised with the idea of publication and light or clear and secret and secret and narrow, narrow, prosperous and prosperous with the idea of publication type and The antecedents or aspirations of Vipralambha, Maan or Ishratheetuk, Migration, Viraha and Karun Pralambha were distinguished

 From the point of view of antecedent reason, on the basis of virtue and brightness, brightness, eye-sighting, imagery, dream and indraja-darshana-jagya and raga are divided into blue, kusumbha and manjistha

 The predicaments of the predecessor - Abhilasha, Anxiety, Reminiscence, Gunakirtana, Udveg, Lament, Vyadhi, Inertia and Death - have been considered, in whose place Vishnu Dharmadartyapurana as the opinion of himself and elsewhere, the commentary of the tentacular, the epithet, the greatness
 And with a slight change in Saraswati Kantharan and poetry, Chakshupriti, mind, remembrance, sleeplessness, tanuta, vocation, shame, mania, Uchrchha and has been mentioned death
 shaardatnay ne ichha tathaa uthkanthaa ko jodakar tathaa vidyanath ne samaran ke sthaan par sankalp laakar or pralaap tathaa sanjvar ko badhaakar inaki sankhya 12 maani he
 It is not rational and can have an inbreeding effect
 maan-vipralambh pranay tathaa ishrya ke vichaar se do prakaar kaa tathaa maan kii sthirataa tathaa aparaadh kii gambhirtha ke vichaar se laghu, madhyam tathaa guru naam se teen prakaar kaa, pravasvipralambh kaaryaj, shaapaj, sanbhramaj naam se teen prakaar kaa or kaaryaj ke yasyatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhootpravas, shaapaj ke tadrupya tathaa vairupy, tathaa sambhramaj ke utpaat, vaat, divya, maanush tathaa parachakradi bhed ke kaaran kai prakaar kaa hota he
 Due to the closeness of Virah Gurujnadi, even after being close, the disconnection of the heroine and the hero coinciding and Karun Vipralambha is the hope of union by resurrection even after death
 shringaar ras ke antargat nayikalankar, ritu tathaa prakruti kaa bhi varnan kiya jaataa he
 An example is- isi prakaar sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit shringaar ras kaa udhaaharan- Distinguishing the self, lust, dislocated, subjugated, hijacked and overbearing from the potentiality of humor and the development of humor and development of humor, making three distinctions from their superior, medium and unholy nature, the two aforesaid distinctions were placed respectively
 has gone
 hindi main keshavadas tathaa ekaadh anya lekhak ne keval mandahas, kalhas, atihaas tathaa parihaas naamak chaar hi bhed kiye hai
 Many other names of humor based on English have also become popular
 udhaaharan - New example- shant kaa koi bhed nahin he
 Only Rudrabhatta has definitely given four distinctions under the names Vairagya, Doshanigraha, Santhosh and Tattvakshakshpatakara which are mere names and their number can be increased
 udhaaharan - In the eight dramas propounded in Bharatamuni's 'natyashastra', the difference between adornment and humor and Karun Rasa was calculated before Rudra
 ‘raudratu karuno ras:’ kahkar 'karun ras' kii utpatti 'raudra ras' se maani gai he or uski utpatti shaapjanya klesh vinipat, ishtjan-viprayog, vibhav naash, vadh, bandhan, vidrav arthath palaayan, apaghaat, vyasan arthath aapatti aadi vibhaavon ke sanyog se sweekaar kii he
 Also nirved, guilt, worry, adulation, impulse, fascination, labor, fear, sadness, pity, sickness, inertia, hysteria, epiphany, tragedy, laziness, death, stanza, vapathu, vevarnya, teardrop, swearing etc
 Calculated as an expression
 udhaaharan - In poetic juices, there is an important place for raudra rasa
 bharat ne ‘naatyashaastra’ main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats, in chaar rason ko hi pradhan mana he, at: inhen se anya rason kii utpatti bataayi he, yatha-‘teshamutpattihetavakshatvaaro rasa: shringaaro rodro vero vibhats iti’
 Describing the origin of Karun Rasa from Raudra, Bharata says that 'raudrasyaiv ch yatkam sa shey: Karuno rasa:'
 raudra ras kaa karm hi karun ras kaa janak hota he
 The 'permanent emotion' of the raudra rasa is 'anger' and its character is blood and the deity Rudra
 keshavadas kii ‘ramachandrika’ se raudra ras kaa udhaaharan pehle hi ankit kiya ja chukaa he
 Examples of raudra rasa are also found in Bhushan's compositions
 vartmaan kaal main shyaamanarayan pandeya tathaa ‘dinakar’ kii rachanaaon main raudra ras kii prabhavakaari vyanjana hui he
 In the Sanskrit texts, 'mahabharata' and 'veeracharit', 'venichabhika' etc
 plays have had a powerful expression of the raudra rasa
 udhaaharan - Along with Shringar, Raudra and Vibhats, Veeraras is also enumerated by Bharata Muni in the original rasas
 vir ras se hi adbhut ras kii utpatti batalaai gai he
 The 'varna' of Veer Ras is called 'swarna' or 'gaur' and the god Indra
 yah uttam prakruti waalo se sambaddh he tathaa iskaa sthaayee bhav ‘utsaah’ he
 Only Yudveer, Dharmaveer, Dayavir and Danveer distinction of Veer Ras are accepted
 utsaah ko aadhaar maanakar panditraj aadi ne anya anek bhed bhi kiye hai
 Examples - adbhut ras ke bharatmuni ne do bhed ie hai- divya tathaa anandaj 
 The Vaishnava Acharya makes a distinction called vision, श्रrut, Sankrit and Anumit

 Three types are considered to be derogatory or illusory, criminological or imaginary, and three types of dissonant or real name, and two types of self-directed distinction from terrible causation
 sthayibhaavon ke kisi vishesh lakshan athwa rason ke kisi bhav kii samanta ke aadhaar par praaia: rason kaa ek duusare main antarbhaav karne, kisi sthayibhav kaa tiraskaar karke naveen sthaayee maanane kii pravriti bhi yada-kada dikhaai padi he
 As such, among Shanta Rasa and Dayavir and Vibhats, Dayavir's intrusion into calm and unhappy permanent Jugupsa is considered permanent
 "naganand" naatak ko koi shant kaa or koi dayavir ras kaa naatak maanata he
 But if the metaphysical pause of calm and compassionate zeal of Dayavir is noted, then there will be a difference between the two
 isi prakaar jugupsa main jo vikarshan he vah shant main nahin rahata
 Quiet ragas-malice is both inclusiveness and metaphysics, in which jugupsa can become communicable
 thik aise jaise karun main bhi sahanubhuti kaa sanchaar rahata he or dayavir main bhi, kintu karun main shok kii sthiti he or dayavir main sahanubhuthaprerit aatmashaktisambhoot aanandarup utsaah kii
 Or, just as both Raudra and Yudhveer have an enemy, so both have the amount of anger, but the rapture in Prahodratikul acuteness and indiscretion, and Yudhveer have a ferocity and prudence
 krodh main shatruvinaash main pratishodh kii bhaavana rahati he or vir main dhairya or udaartaa
 Therefore, their mutual interaction is not possible

 According to the treatise called Gangadharrita Gandasara, the following six types of methods were mainly used in the manufacture of cosmetics in the then India

 aadhunik kaal main vishesh prakaar ke sabunon tathaa angaraagon kaa vistaar or prachaar shaareerik saundaryavriddhi ke liye hi nahin apitu shaareerik doshapchaar ke liye bhi bad rahaa he
 Therefore, in order to keep such formal cosmetics separate from medicines, the manufacture and sale of these substances in the United States and other foreign countries is being tightly controlled by government laws

 CBS Broadcasting Inc
 is a major American television network, beginning as a radio network
 The name has its origins in the early characters of the network Columbia Broadcasting System
 company ke logo ke sandarbh main network kaa ullekh kabhi-kabhi "ai network" ke rup main bhi kiya jaataa he
 It is also called the "tiffany Network", which gives us a feel of the high quality programming that CBS did during the tenure of its founder, William S
 Paley

 It was founded by the talented New York agent Arthur Judson; Unite needed additional investors; The Columbia Phonograph Company saved the company from drowning in April 1924, which resulted in the renaming of the network to be the "colombia Phonographic Broadcasting System"
 On September 18, 1927, Columbia Phonographic was broadcast from New York's flagship station WOR with 15 collaborators

 With the removal of Columbia, Paley named the "columbia Broadcasting System" to streamline the corporate name

 Paley believed in the power of programming and quickly CBS became a stronghold of many popular music and comedy stars, among them Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, George Burns, & Gracie Allen, and Kate Smith

 In the difficult times of the early 1930s, CBS Radio expanded its offering; After an AP franchise was rejected for the news, Paley started an independent news arm, which was shaped in the first year by Paley's vice president and former The New York Times member Ed Kloeber and news director Paul Voight
 In 1935, another member, Edward R
 Muro was soon recruited as "director of Talks"

 CBS later changed the television format for Without Warning in the 1990s, with the story of an asteroid crashing into the Earth, but the television format allows for a disclaimer to be broadcast at every comercial break, which occurred in 1938 Was to avoid that recurrence

 Chester was recruited to serve as the Director of Latin America Relations and Director of Short Wave Broadcast for the CBS Radio Network in the Associated Press at the position of Bureau Chief of Latin America
 In this capacity, Mr
 Chester handled the development of America's network with the Department of State, Office for interamerican Affair and Voice of America

 As long as radio was an effective medium for advertising, CBS dominated broadcasting
 CBS programs were often given the highest ratings throughout the 1950s and 1960s
 In the mid-1940s Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen and Amos 'n' Andy, an extremely popular "talent Red" on NBC, were brought to CBS
 From the early days of broadcasting, Paley was also an innovator in making original programming, selling period to advertising agencies as Half or Phool Havar Balok
 Advertising agencies, rather than his network, produced the program to cater for time and so it was "the Johnsons Wakes Program" with Fiber mcgee & Mollie, or "the Pepsodent Show" with Bob Hope
 " 1940 dashak ke madhya main paale ke prayaason kii shuruyaat hui, sibies ne apane swayan ke kaaryakramon kaa nirmaan shuru kiya; is pariyojna se utpann hone vaale lambi avadhi ke kaaryakramon main shaamil the you aar der, maai favorit hasband, aavar miss brooks, ganasmoke or da adventure of ozi and heriet he

 When CBS announced in 1956 that their radio operations had lost money, while television networks had benefited, it became clear what the company's future was oriented towards

 Following the retirement of talk show promoter Earther Godfrey in April 1972, CBS Radio's programming included an extensive schedule of hourly news broadcasts and news features, known as Dimensions and Commentary in the 1970s, gaining popularity in commentary
 Includes a spectrum series, including 60 minutes of television networks and point / count in first line reports Including Point facilities, it was considered good news and analysis, which was presented by reporters for CBS and was offered to the CBS radio station

 The CBS radio network continues to this day, but mainly features just its finest news crew, including its centerpiece "world News Roundup" in the morning and evening, and news-related programs such as "the Osgood File" and "harry Smith Reporting" As well as other talk programs

 While there were many competing patents and systems at the time, RCA set the fcc's technical standards episodes and captured popularity through CBS, dumont, and others from appearing on television at the 1939 New York World's Fair to the general public
 
 epasisi ne 1 july 1941 main vanijyik televijan steshnon ko license dena shuru kiya; sabase pehle aaarasie or enbisi ke dabluanbiti ko mila; or usee din doosraa license dablusibidbalu ko mila

 At that time and later, after much hesitation, the FCC rejected cbs's technology in favor of RCA
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan, vanijyik televijan kaa prasaaran naatakeey dhang se kam ho gaya tha
 Towards the end of the war, commercial television once again made the leap, this time in the 1945–1947 period, with three New York television stations clearly presenting an increasing level of programming, which operated in those years, But as RCA and Dumont were vying to set up the network and offer advanced programming, the CBC was lagging behind, and it offered its inconsistent color Rnali began advocating to resume the displacement and UHF throughout industry
 Only in 1950, when NBC was most effective in television and black-and-white broadcasts were widespread, did CBS begin to build or purchase its own stations in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities
 us bindu tak, sibies kii programing ko los angeles main, KTTV channel 11 jaise steshnon main dekha gaya, jisamen sibies ne - los angeles main beemaa kii ek bit or guarantee program nikasi ke rup main- teji se 50% byaaj kharida

 a reluctant CBS star denied her radio show "my Favorite Husband" appearing on television and said it would not happen until the network re-produced the show with her real husband in the lead role
 Paley and network president Frank Stanton had so little confidence in the future of the Lucille Ball series, titled i Love Lucy, that they accepted her wish and allowed her husband Desi Arnaz to take over financial control of the production
 This was the beginning of the ball-arnaz Desilu Empire and became a blueprint for the creation of the series till date
 1940 ke dashak ke uttarardh main sibies ne united nesan jeneral essembali ke kaarywahi kii sarvapratham sajiv televijan kawarej kii peshkash kii

 As television came to the forefront in the form of American entertainment and information, CBS also dominated television as did radio
 1953 main, sibies televijan network ne apana pehla laabh hasil kiya, or 1955 or 1976 ke bich televijan main apane prabhutv ko banaae rakhaa 1950 ke dashak ke ant main network root 66 jaise achche sho ke saath aksar "sheersh das" reating list main saatven yaa aathven sthaan ko banaae rakhaa tha
 This success continued for several years, but by the emergence of ABC in the mid-1970s, CBS jumped straight into first place
 Probably due to its status as a top-rated network, during the 1960s and early 1970s, CBS was mingled with the controversial theatrical program of the Smothers Brothers comedy Hover and All in the Family and many of its by-products
 - There was a fear in meeting

 It was watched by nearly 106 million American viewers, making it the most-watched episode in United States history, a record that lasted until 2010 Super Ball XLIV and was also broadcast on CBS
 yadhyapi sibies-tivi aisa pehla tha jo rangeen televijan pranali par kaam karata tha, lekin 1953 main ve aaarasie se peeche ho gaye, kyonki sibies color system maujuuda blike-and-white set ke saath asangat tha
 Although RCA made the color system available to CBS, the network had no interest in increasing rca's profits and only made some specials in color for the rest of the decades
 These specials included the Ford Star Jubilee program
 Other special programs were also seen: Cinderella's 1957 broadcast of Rodgers and Hammerstein's, Alladin's musical version of Cole Porters and Playhouse 90, the only color broadcast, the 1958 production of The Nutcracker, featuring George Balanshin's choreography
 , Which was on display annually in New York from 1954 and was performed by the New York City Ballet

 However, it was the success of Mary Martin Peter Pan's 1955 broadcast, NBC, which was the most-watched television special at the time, inspiring CBS to create The Wizard of Oz, Cinderella and Alladin
 1960 se lekar 1965 tak sibies tivi ne apane rangeen prasaaran ko simit karte hue da vijard of ooj jaise kuch vishesh kaaryakramon kaa hi prasaaran kiya or aisa ve tabhi karte the jab praayojak iske liye bhugtan karata tha
 On cbs's host Red Skeleton was the first weekly program to be broadcast in Color, using a converted film studio, in the early 1960s he tried unsuccessfully to convince others to use his facilities for other programs , But they later forced to sell it
 udhar duusari taraf pratidwandvi enbisi dwaara rangeen kaaryakramon ko khaasi tavajjo di ja rahi thi
 Even ABC produced a number of color programs, they started these programs in the fall of 1962, but such programs were quite limited due to the economic and technical conditions of the network
 is samay ke dauraan sibies tivi ke vishesh kaaryakramon main charles collingwood kii mezbaani main white house wyeth first ladi jaiki kennedy daura tha
 However, it was broadcast in black-and-white
 It debuted in 1963, filming a CBS show, The Lucy Show, in color at the insistence of its artist and producer Lucille Ball; He realized that when they would eventually be sold to agglomeration, the color episode would have more money for the money, but it still aired in the 1964–65 season in Black and White
 All of this changed completely in the mid-1960s, when there was market pressure on CBS TV to add a color program to the regular schedule of the 1965–66 season and to fully color the 1966–67 season
 
 By the fall of 1967, almost all of CBS tv's programs were colorful, as were those on NBC and ABC

 In 1965, CBS broadcast a colorful version of Cinderella of Rogers and Hammerstein
 The version cast Lesley Ann Wren and Stewart Damon, previously starring Julie Andrews and John Cypher, was filmed on videotape rather than broadcast live and became an annual tradition for the next nine years 
 1967 main, sibies ke da vijard of ooj ke vaarshik prasaaran ke adhikaron ke liye enbisi ne badhkar boli lagaai or yah film enbisi ke adhikaar main aa gai
 However the network soon realized its mistake of allowing one of the Prime Ratings winners to be acquired by another network and by 1976 the film was back to CBS, where it remained until the end of 1997
 CBS showed it twice in 1991, the first time in March and the second time before Thanksgiving
 After that, it was shown before Thanksgiving

 Fred Silverman, by mid-1971, decided to cancel most of the shows that were colloquially referred to as "rural purges", with Green Acres actor Pat Butrum commenting that the network had "every single event Canceled the tree in which it was "
 jabaki "rural" sho par kulhadi chali or da meri tyler moore sho, ol in da family, M*A*S*H, da bob newheart sho, kenon, barnaabi joness, kojak or da sonni and chiyar kamedi havar jaise nae hits kaaphi prasiddh hue or 70 ke dashak ke prarambh main sibies ko sheersh ranking main pahunchaa diya

 By 1982, abc's energy had run out, NBC was in a lot of trouble with the failure of several programming attempts passed by him during Silverman's tenure between 1978 and 1981, and once again CBS, Dallas, Falcon Crest, Magnum , P

 ABC Network also took a turn and made a comeback with hits like Dynasty, Who's the Boss ?, Hotel and Growing Pence
 By the 1988–1989 season, CBS had slipped to third place behind NBC and ABC and had to undergo some major remodeling
 vidambnaatmak rup se kuch aadhaar kaaryon ko pehle se hi kiya ja chukaa tha, jabaki 1980 ke dashak ke prarambh se murder, shi rot, ket and eli or newheart us samay tak bani hui thi or bhavi hit digining vuman or murphi brown ko haal hi main jari kiya gaya
 saath hi, 60 minute, dalas or nots landing ke liye is samay tak bhi sibies ko acchhee reating di ja rahi thi
 However the ratings at this time were quite condemnable compared to the earlier ratings being given for Dallas and Notts Landing
 1990 ke dashak ke shuruuaat ke dauraan, network ne pramukh lig besabaal ke prasaaran or winter olympic ko jodne ke madhyam se apane khel linep main majbooti laai
 The network, under the supervision of network president Jeff Sagansky, was able to effectively gain ratings during that time on the new shows Diagnosis Murder, Touched by An Angel, Dr
 Quinn, Medicine Women, Walker, Texas Ranger and Alpalaik Jake and the Fatman
 CBS was again able to finish first in the 1993 season, although its demographics were relatively limited at the time with ABC, NBC and Even Fox was unbalanced
 1993 main, enbisi ke tunite sho se pratispardhaa karne ke liye is network ne ek der raat ke safal tok sho franchiji ko sthapit kiya or usne enbisi ke david letterman ko apane liye anubandhit kiya jab let nit ke mejabaan ko tunit par johny carsan ke uttaradhikari ke rup main je lino ke paksh main nirdhaarit kiya gaya
 In 1993, the inexperienced Fox Network increased bids from CBS for broadcast rights to the National Football League, resulting in many stations turning to Fox

 And they are suddenly attacked by cannibal crocodiles
 saraman behad sahaspurn dhang se apane bhaale se ladata he or unhen maar daalata he
 Then, after carrying them, they return to the village where they cheer as heroes
 saraman ko us raat neend nahin aati: jab bachapan main uske mata-pita ko kho detaa he, uske man main ab bhi kai dinon se apane chachee kii gunagunaahat gunjati mahasoos hoti he, or jab sapane dekhtaa he to use ek seengvaala vicitra pashu or mohenjo daaro ke vishaal nagar kii jhalak dikhaai padati
 However, his uncle never allows Sarman's decision to go to Mohenjo Daro
 aakhirkaar uske chachaa haar maanate he, or salaah dete he ki mohenjo daaro ek bahut nirmam nagar he or saraman ko kisi par bhi bharose par ehtiyaat baratane ko kehete he
 His uncle used to give him a dirty mess which tells him to use it only when he is alive or when he dies
 tamaam maal-asabaab ke saath vyapaar ko niklaa saraman jyon hi mohenjo daaro pahunchataa he to vah nagar kii vishalata or vaibhav dekh awak rah jaataa he
 The market here attracts unseen and unique goods and livestock sales from Macedonian and Sumerian and foreign traders
 saraman ko maaloom ho jaataa he ki mohenjo daaro ke shashan bagdor uske pramukh taanashaah maham or uske dusht bete munja ke haathon main he
 Maham proposes to raise additional taxes from farmers; On this proposal, all the mps of the city council give their support, who are the companions of Maham except the representatives of the agricultural farmers
 chunaav biit jaataa he or jab kisaanon ke pratinidhi maham kii karatuuton kaa benakaab karte hue dhamkaate hue yah puchhate he – ki kyon aakhir maham ko padosi nagar hadappa ne unako tadeepaar karaayaa – maham tatkaal unhen maar daalata he
 On the other hand, Sarman meets a beautiful girl named Chani, the daughter of Mohenjo Daro's head priest and she will choose only 'one' who will liberate the city and bring a new dawn
 is tarah vah mohenjo daaro ke kisaanon ke saath maham ke is nae kar ke viruddh baghawat kaa netritv karata he vah nagar ke sambhraant varg main apane chachaa ke die tabiz ke kaaran jagah bana letaa he, jab vah chaani ko gussell ghode ke prahaar ko bachaa letaa he, tab vah uske pita se miltaa he, pramukh purohit, is mulaakaat ke baad hi use pahchaan letaa he
 Sarman and Chani are unable to express their mutual love in front of the people, but Chani's tearful statement that he is being forcibly married to Munja
 nav chandramaa ke utsav par yojit nrity dauraan hi maham ko saraman or chaani ek-duusare se prem karte hai or ye bhi ki saraman hi kar virodhiyon kaa netaa he
 Maham immediately declares the death penalty to Sarman but realizes that he has the support of the public, then Maham avoids the punishment and very deviously challenges Sarman to play goat-zokhar
 saraman ke saamne yahi prastaav rakhaa jaataa he ki yadi vah vijayi hua to chaani ko is sagaai se mukt kar degaa
 And he accepts it
 pramukh purohit karawas main saraman se miltaa he
 He tells that Mahim was despised due to the illicit trade of Sheesham in Harappa with the Sumerians
 maham anya saudagaron ke bhaanti hi mohenjo daaro daakhil hua or dekhte hi dekhte is dhandhe ke kaaran nagar parishad tak apni pahunch bana sakaa
 At the same time, Maham has accumulated extensive gold reserves in the great Indus River and then Mahm proposes to build a dam in the river with a big plan and the gold mine finds another way and starts depositing in the chest of Mohenjo Daro
 
 shrujan naamak budhimaan va eemaandaar pradhan is yojana kaa virodh karata he lekin maham kisi tarah use naakaam karata he or baandh kaa nirmaan karwaata he
 Mahm arrests Shrujan by false accusation of gold hoarding
 use is baat kaa behad pachhtaawaa hota he ki kaise unako va durjan ko maham kii dhamkiyaan milti thi yadi unhone virdohi shrujan kii sahaytaaki to
 Shrujan is killed
 purohit bataata he ki saraman hi shrujan kaa betaa he or use hi dusht maham ke atyaachaar se mukti deni hogi
 Sarman is confronted by a huge battle arena in the Tajik mountain's crumbling man-eaters Bakar and Zokhar
 is lambii or beraham ladaai main vah ek aadamkhor ko maar daalata he lekin jakhmi kar chhod detaa he or mohenjo daaro ke logon main uski vijay ko lekar harsh kii lahar daud padati he
 Maham fires in anger and asks Munja to destroy the priest and Chani
 munja aaveg main pavitra mandir pahunchataa he or purohit ko markar chaani kii ore bhaagta he
 Sarman saves Chani and kills Munja
 saraman janata kii aguwai karata hua vaapis nagar parishad pahunch kar maham ko chunauti detaa he
 Chani exposes a scheme involving Maham that he himself went to Abhir by hoarding the Indus gold and smuggling copper and bronze weapons from the west
 saraman ko mili is samarthan par nagar parishad ke sabhi pramukh maham ke viruddh faisla sunaate he
 The public selects Sarman as the new head, but Sarman suggests that the people of Mohenjo Daro need the government and not the head
 sindhu nadi, par nirmit baandh dhire-dhire badhki vajah se charmarane lagata he
 Sarman realizes that the dam will soon collapse and submerge the entire city
 isse purv nadi puri tarah baandh dhaha detii saraman sabhi logon se ekasaath naukaaen jodne ko kahata he or ek tairta pul sa bana detaa he
 Mohenjo Daro is almost empty and the bridge is taken to the other end of the river
 baandh tabah hota he or nadi prachand veg se nagar main pravesh karti he
 Maham, tied in chains at the crossroads of the city, drowns in this inundation
 mahaan mohenjo daaro kaa namonishaan mit jaataa he
 By the next morning, the Indus River cools down and they drift to the eastern Himalayas
 chaani nadi kinare logon saath mahasoos karte he ki bhavishyavaanee sach pramanit hui he: yah ek nai subah thi
 Sarman is also seen as the one-horned animal at the other end
 logon main is nadi ke nae naam ko lekar fusfusaahat hoti he
 And the film ends with a word uttered by Sarman: Ganga

 hindi ke bhi aise anek kosh bane
 The first dictionary was probably Ferguman's 'hindustani English' dictionary which was published in London in 1773 AD
 in aarambhik koshon ko 'hindustani kosh' kaha gaya
 These dictionaries were mainly from Hindi
 paashchaatya vidwaanon ke in koshon main hindi ko hindustani kehane kaa kadachit yah kaaran he ki hindustan bharat kaa naam mana gaya or vahaan kii bhashaa hindustani kahi gai
 In the view of these western pundits of phonology, the synonym of Hindi was Hindustani and in general it was the national language of India

 From the above semantics of Latin, Shanai: Shani: The Vaikasik stair of modern theology of the West emerged
 bharat or pashchim donon hi sthanon main shabdon ke sakalan main vargapaddati kaa koi na koi rup mil jaataa he
 But later on, the first and foremost distinguishing feature of the new and old dictionaries of the new dictionary was the first - the method of 'alphabetical order'
 yorape main aadhunik koshon kaa jo swaroop viksit hua, uski ruparekha kaa sanket upar kiya ja chukaa he
 In the coast of Europe, Asia and Africa, which came under the influence of Arab countries, shells were being made on the emulation of the said method
 bharat main vyapak paimaane par jis rup main kosh nirmat hote chale, unki sankshipt charchaa kii ja chuki he
 On the basis of all these, it can be said that while assessing the characteristics of modern dictionaries of the best class: koshanirmaan kaa shabdasankalan sarvapramukh aadhaar he
 But the task of collecting words is very difficult
 mukhya rup main shabdon kaa chayan do stroton se hota he - Handwritten and printed texts are taken for written words from written literature
 parantu iske antargat pracheen hastlekhon or mudrit gratho ke aadhaar par jab shabdasankalan hota he tab ubhayvidh aadhargranthon kii pramanikta or pathshuddhi aavashyak hoti he

 The first branch of Cubism known as Analytical Cubism left a brief but influential as art movement for a brief period in France between 1907 and 1911
 The movement grew into its second phase under the name of synthetic cubism and played an important role until about 1919, until the Surrealist movement gained popularity
 angreji kala itihaaskaar duglas kupar ne apni moulik pustak da cubist ipak main cubism ke teen charnon kaa varnan kiya he
 According to Cooper, "early Cubism" was when the movement was initially developed in Picasso and Barack's studios, the second stage being called "high cubism", during which Juan Gris emerged as an important exponent and eventually Cooper " Last Cubism "called the last phase of the radical neo-thinker art movement
 cubist chitrakala main vastuon ko todaa jaataa he, unka vishleshan kiya jaataa he or ek nazariye ke bajaae phir se pruthak rup se banaaya jaataa he, kalakaar vishay kaa kai anya drushtikonon se bade sandarbh main pratinidhitiv karata he

 prishthbhumi or vastuon kaa samtal dharaatal paraspar anupravesh kar uthlaa aspasht sthaan banaata he jo cubism kii khaas visheshtaon main se ek he
 English art historian, collector and author of The Cubist epuck, Douglas Cooper said of Paul Goguin and Paul Cézanne "both of these artists were particularly influenced by the formation of Cubism and by Picasso's paintings during 1906 to 1907"
 
 Cooper says that Les Demoiselles is often erroneously referred to as the first Cubist painting
 ve bataate hai, Some believe that Cubism's roots were found in two different trends in Cézanne's later works: first to break the dyed surface into smaller multilateral fields of colors, later on this mixed vision given by the telescopic approach
 Emphasis and other cylinders, through an interest in the simplification of natural forms of circles

 The invention of Cubism included the joint effort of Picasso and Barak, residents of Montmare, Paris

 Later Spanish Juan Gris also joined as an active participant in this movement
 After meeting in 1907, Barack and Picasso began work specifically on the development of Cubism
 picasso shuruyaat main vah shakti or prabhaav the jisane baraak ko 1908 tak fowism se alag hone ke liye raji kiya
 The two artists began working together from late 1908 and early 1909 until the First World War broke out in 1914
 andolan tezi se paris or puure europe main fail gaya
 French art critic Louis Vauxelles used the term "cubism" or "bijare cubics" for the first time after seeing a painting made by Barack in 1908
 unhone ise "chote cubs se bharaa hua" ke rup main varnit kiya he, jiske baad jaldi hi is shabd kaa vyapak upyog hone laga, haalanki shuru main in do rachanakaaron ne ise nahin apanaaya tha
 Art historian Ernst Gombrich described Cubism as "the most fundamental attempt to eradicate ambiguity and to force a text of the picture, which is a man-made construction, a tinted canvas"
 cubism maantaparnaase main anek kalakaaron dwaara apanaaya gaya or kala vyapaaree dainiel henry conviller ne ise protsaahit kiya, yah itani jaldi lokapriy ho gaya ki 1911 ke aalochakon dwaara kalakaaron ke ek "cubic skool" kaa zikr kiya jane laga
 However, many artists who considered themselves Cubists went in directions that were quite different from those of Barack and Picasso

 At the time when there were new ideas about the religion of Lord Mahavira and Buddha in India, a reformer was born in China, named Confucius
 us samay china main jhou rajvansh kaa basant or sharad kaal chal rahaa tha
 Over time, the power of the Zhou dynasty had become weak, many states were established in China, which always fought among themselves, which came to be called the era of quarreling states

 He used to inspire people to become humble, benevolent, virtuous and characterful
 They used to ask elders and ancestors to respect them
 He used to say don't treat others like you don't want to do with yourself
 kanceyucious ek sudhaarak the, dharm prachaarak nahin
 He did not give any teachings about God, but still later people started considering him as a religious teacher
 inaki mrityu 480 i

 Confucian social reformers preached a stability in Chinese society

 The Confucians never thought it necessary to give their ideas in writing
 uskaa mat tha ki vah vichaaron kaa vaahak ho saktaa he, unka srashta nahin
 He was a worshiper of archeology, because he thought that only through this can real knowledge be gained
 uskaa kahana tha ki manushya ko uske samast kaaryakalapon ke liye niyam apane andar hi praapt ho sakate hai
 Not only for the individual, but the rules and patterns of improvement and correct development of the whole society can be found in the words and work of the ancient Mahatmas
 kanfushas ne koi aisa lekh nahin choda jisamen uske dwaara pratipaadit naitik evam saamaajik vyavastha ke siddhanton kaa nirupan ho

 He used to study ancient history, poetry and social practices of the country from him
 kanfushas kaa kahana tha ki kisi desh main acha shashan or shanti tabhi sthapit ho sakati he jab shaasha, mantri tathaa janata kaa prayek vyakti apane sthaan par uchit kartavyon kaa paalan karata rahe
 The ruler should be the ruler in the true sense, the minister should be the minister in the true sense
 kanfushas se ek baar poocha gaya ki yadi use kisi pradesh ke shashansutra ke sanchaalan kaa bhaar saunpa jaae to vah sabase pehla koun sa mahatvapurn kaary karegaa
 His answer for this was - 'improvement of Names'
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki jo jis naam ke pad par pratishthit ho use us pad se sanlagn sabhi kartavyon kaa vidhiwat paalan karnaa chahie jisase uskaa vah naam sarthak ho
 He had full faith in the power of example and ideal
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki adarsh vyakti apane sadacharan se jo udhaaharan prastut karte hai, aam janata unke saamne nishchay hi jhuk jaati he
 If the ruler of a country is made well aware of what he should do and how to do governance, then surely he can improve his conduct and make his state happy by presenting his example, Can make it rich and prosperous
 isi vishwaas ke bal par kanfushas ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki yadi koi shaasha 12 maheene ke liye use apana mukhya paramarshdaata bana le to vah bahut kuch karke dikhaa saktaa he or yadi use teen varsh kaa samay diya jaae to vah apane aadarsho or aashaaon ko moort rup pradaan kar saktaa he
 Confucius never claimed that he received any divine power or divine messages
 vah keval is baat kaa chintan karata tha ki vyakti kya he or samaaj main uske kartavya kya hai
 He never mentioned power performance, extraordinary and non-human powers, rebellious tendencies and deities
 uskaa kathan tha ki budhimatta kii baat yahi he ki prayek vyakti purna uttardayitv or eemaandaaree se apane kartavya kaa paalan kare or devi devataaon kaa aadar karte hue bhi unase alag rahe
 He was of the opinion that the person who cannot serve human beings will serve the Gods and Goddesses
 use apane or dusron ke sabhi kartavyon kaa purna dhyaan tha, isiilie usne kaha tha ki bura aadmi kabhi bhi shashan karne ke yogya nahin ho saktaa, bhale hi vah kitna bhi shaktisampann ho
 The ruler punishes those who violate the rules, but he should never forget that there is no power other than the power to present his ideal of good conduct
 kanfushas ke darshanik, saamaajik tathaa raajnneetik vichaaron par aadhaarit mat ko kanfooshivaad yaa kungaphutsiwad naam diya jaataa he
 According to Confucian, goodness is a natural quality of man
