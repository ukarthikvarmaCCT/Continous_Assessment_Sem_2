 a microscope is a device with which very small particles, which are approximately the size of a molecule and not visible with an ordinary microscope, can be seen
 vastav main yah koi naveen upkaran nahin he, keval ek acha sookshmdarshi hi he, jisaki vishesh reeti se kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 When we look at objects with transmitted light by using ordinary microscopes, they stop the light from falling in the path of light, so that they appear as black images on the illuminated background
 parantu bahut chote kanon ko pargamit prakaash dwaara dekhnaa asambhav he, kyonki jitna prakaash ek chota kan roktaa he usase bahut adhik prakaash us kan ke chaaron ore ke binduon se aankh main pahunch jaataa he
 The particle becomes invisible due to the glare it produces
 yadi sookshmdarshi kaa prabandh is prakaar kiya jaae ki kanon ko kisi paardarshak drav main daal diya jaae, jisamen ve dhule nahin or phir in kanon par bagal se prakaash daalaa jaae to prakaash kanon se takaraakar upar rakhe hue ek sookshmdarshi main pravesh kar saktaa he
 If the particles are now seen with a microscope placed in this position, they begin to appear as glowing dots on a completely black background, because the particles of the fluid are not illuminated due to being transparent
 yahi atisookshmdarshi kaa siddhant he
 R
 Zigmondi and H
 Seidantoff made great improvements in the method of microscopy that made it possible to see very fine particles
 ab surya ke prakaash ke sthaan par saadhaarant pointolite lamp kaa teevr prakaash kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 In this lamp, a small metal sphere becomes overheated and gives white light
 sookshmdarshi ke siddhant ke anusaar sookshmdarshi kii vibhedan kshamta kii bhi ek seemaa he, arthath yadi kanon kaa aakaar ham chota karte chale jaaen to ek aisi avasthaa aa jaaegi jisase adhik chota hone par kan apane vaastavik rup main pruthak dikhaai nahin degaa
 The larger the diameter of the microscope's visual magnifier, and the lower the wavelength of light used to see the particles, the greater the resolution capability will be obtained
 duusare shabdon main, ham kah sakate hai ki kisi sookshmdarshi kii vibhedan kshamta uske abhidrishy taal ke mukh vyas kii samaanupati or prayukt prakaash ke tarangadairghy kii pratilomanupati hoti he
 No matter how good an ordinary microscope is, it can never realistically show an object whose diameter is less than half the wavelength of the light used
 parantu atisookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se, anukool paristhitiyon main, itane chote-chote kan dekhe ja sakate hai jinka vyas prakaash ke tarangadairghy ke 1,100 bhaag ke baraabar ho
 These particles are called microscopic particles
 yadi in kanon ko saadhaaran reeti se sookshmdarshi dwaara dekhne kaa praytn kiya jaae to ve dikhaai nahin dete, jiskaa kaaran pehle bataaya ja chukaa he
 This is also the reason why stars do not appear in the sky during the day
 yadi pehle bataai gai reeti se ati sookshm kanon par ek disha se teevr prakaash daalaa jaae or sookshmdarshi ke aksh ko usase lamb rakhkar un kanon ko dekha jaae to ati sookshm hone ke kaaran prayek kan prakirnan dwaara prakaash ko aankh main bhej degaa
 Then it will start to appear like a illuminated circular disc due to being surrounded by glowing circular diffraction bands
 in chakttiyon kaa abhaasi vyas kanon ke vaastavik vyas se bahut bada hota he
 Therefore we cannot get any definite knowledge about the size of particles from the diameter of these boards, but still understand the existence of particles from them, count their number and find its masses and speeds
 atisookshmdarshi jis siddhant par kaam karata he uskaa udhaaharan ham apane dainik jivan main us samay dekhte hai jab surya prakaash kii kirane kisi chhidr se kamare main pravesh karti hai or hawa main udate hue asankhya atisookshm kanon ke astitv kaa gyaan karaati hai
 If we look at the incoming rays, these microscopic particles will not be visible
 san 1899 i
 main lord raile ne gananaa se siddh kar diya ki jo kan achche se achche sookshmdarshi dwaara saadhaaran reeti se pruthak pruthak nahin dekhe ja sakate unako adhik teevr prakaash se prakashit karke atisookshmdarshi kii reeti se ham dekh sakate hai, yadhyapi is reeti se ham unke vaastavik aakaar kaa gyaan nahin praapt kar sakate
 Examination of many solutions by a microscope reveals that within those solutions, either small particles of the solid float in the colloidal state (kaloid state) or the solid is completely mixed in the solution
 uski sahaayta se kaliloy vilyanon main brounian gati kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 If a few drops of water are rubbed on the glass strip and put two drops of water on it and then the water is examined with a microscope, then numerous small particles will be seen running in different directions very quickly
 is gati ko sabase pehle san 1827 i
 main aar
 brown ne dekha tha, isliye unke naam par ise brounian gati kehete hai
 If a silver arc is burnt in the air with lightning, it also produces silver chalky particles, which can be seen by putting brown water in water
 is gati main kan ascharyajanak veg se idhar-udhar bhaagate hue dikhaai dete hai jinaki tulana dhoop main bhanabhanate hue ek machhar samudaay se kii ja sakati he
 The subtlety of particles seen by the microscope depends on the intensity of light
 prakaash kii tivrata jitani adhik hogi utane hi adhik sookshm kan dikhaai dene lagenge

 The film begins in Lakhisarai village where politicians of the state take over the land of poor villagers
 lakhisarai gaanv kaa vidhayak bablu pande hota he jo ki bhrasht tareeke se sabhi kii jaminen chhinakar vahaan khud kii factory lagaana chahta he
 In this, Police DCP Bhola Nath Singh Prakash Jha also helps Bablu Pandey
 gaanv kii paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue abha maathur kaa sthanantaran ho jaataa he
 The villagers keep committing suicides every day due to debt, due to which the MLA Bablu Pandey and corrupt police officers are
 jab gaanv ke sabhi log apni - apni jaminen de dete he to sunita naamak apni jameen dene se inkaar kar detii he is kaaran vidhayak ke bhai dablue pande ko gussa aa jaataa he
 Then shortly after, Sunita's father commits suicide
 dablue pande ko gussa aa jaataa he or wo sunita kaa apharan karvaa letaa he lekin thode hi samay baad unki hatya kar di jaati he
 Abha Mathur does not trust Bhola Nath Singh at all
 iske pashchaat bholaa nath singh ko gussa aa jaataa he or wo ise giraftaar karne jaataa he lekin vahiin par sunita kaa bhai nagesh use kamarbandh se galaa ghontkar maar detaa he or phir gaanv vaale usee ped par lataka dete he jahaan par unke pita latak kar mare the
 Similarly, all the people of Lakhisarai village flare up and clearly threaten all policemen that now the situation will be here
 is baat kaa pataa bablu pandey chal jaataa he ki unke bhai dablue pandey kii hatya balak nagesh ne kii he to vah apane aadamiyon ko bol detaa he ki jahaan kahin bhi ho usko mere saamne lekar aao
 Similarly, DCP Bhola Nath Singh also changes and they leave Babu Pandey and start supporting Abha Mathur but Abha Mathur still does not believe
 disipi bholaa nath ek baar lakhisarai gaanv jate he to usapar bablu pandey hamalaa kar detaa he or vahaan par khub pitayee karte he phir bhi bi
en singh nagesh ko unke hawaale nahin karte hai
 BN Singh is completely injured and SP Abha Mathur reaches there and BN
 Singh is admitted to the hospital
 thode samay baad bholaa nath singh / bi
en
 singh bablu pandey kii sabhi puraani cese kii filein espi abha maathur ko saunp dete hai
 Here, with the help of the police officer Prabhu Narayan, Munna Murdani picks up Sunita's brother Nagesh, due to which Bhola Nath Singh gets furious
 nagesh kaa pataa jaanane ke liye disipi bholaa nath singh police inspector amarik kii madad se ek chaal chalate he or munna maradaani ko ghar se nikalava kar markar ped se lataka dete hai
 Meanwhile, MLA Bablu Pandey and his men go to the temple, they get angry seeing Munna Mardani hanging from the tree, turn their way to the factory and meanwhile, Bhola Nath Singh tells Abha Mathur that Nagesh was kept in Bansal's factory has gone
 jab tak abha maathur pahunchati he tab tak bholaa nath singh pahunch kar nagesh ko bachaakar bablu pandey ko latakaate hi he ki abha maathur aa jaati he or unhen chhodane ko bolti he lekin bi
en
singh nahin maanate he or gaanvvaalon ke saath josh main aae bablu pandey ko latakaate hi he ki espi abha maathur kanoon ko maanate hue disipi bholaa nath singh ke haath par goli maar detii he or bablu pandey se thodi bahut hathapayee karke giraftaar kar detii he

 Shilaras are a very useful substance, which is very much used in daily life
 shilaras vastav main udprangaron kaa mishran hota he
 It was also formed like coal due to the vegetation being buried under the earth and due to high pressure and temperature over time
 prakritik rup se paae jane vaale shilaras ko aprishkrut tel kehete hai jo kaale rang kaa gadha drav hota he
 Its effective distillation produces kerosene, petrol, diesel, natural gas, Vaseline, coal tar lubricant oil, etc
 darasal jab tel ke bhandar prithvi par kahin dhunde jate hai, tab yah gadhe kaale rang kaa hota he
 Which is called crude oil and has a plurality of uppermosters
 udprangaron kii khaasiyat yah hoti he ki inamen maujuud hydrogen or prangaar ke anu ek duusare se vibhinn shrinkhalaaon main bandhe hote hai
 These chains are of different types
 yahi shrinkhlaayein vibhinn prakaar ke tel utpaadon kaa strot hoti hai
 Their shortest series form the basis of a product called Methane
 inamen lambii shrinkhalaaon vaale udprangaron thos jaise ki mom yaa tar naamak utpaada kaa nirmaan karte hai
 When the oil is extracted from the earth, the crude oil is in solid form
 isse tel ke vibhinn rup paane ke liye aprishkrut tel main maujuud udprangaar ke vibhinn chen ko alag karnaa padataa he
 The process of separating the different chains of udpangar is called udprangar by adding chemical crosses
 jise ham shodhan prakriya ke naam se jaanate hai
 This purification process takes place in refining factories
 ek tarah se yah shodhan behad aasaan bhi hota he or mushkil bhi
 This is easy when you are aware of the hydropower found in crude oil and difficult when it is not known
 darasal har prakaar ke udprangaron kaa kvathanank ke, alag-alag hota he is tarah aswan kii prakriya se unhen aasaani se alag kiya ja saktaa he
 This is an important stage in the entire process of the oil refinery
 darasal aprishkrut tel ko alag-alag taapmaana par garm karke vaashp ekatrit karke tathaa use dobaaraa sanghanit karke udprangaar kii alag-alag chen nikaal lee jaati hai
 This is the most common and oldest method of refining in an oil refinery
 ubalte taapmaana kaa upyog karne vaali is vidhi ko prabhaji aswan kehete hai
 One method of distillation is that instead of taking a long chain of udprangar, it is taken out by breaking it into small chains
 is prakriya ko rasinic prasanskaran kehete hai
 So kids, you must have understood how fuels are made other than petrol and kerosene

 koharaa yaa fog praayah thandi ardra hawa main banataa he or iske astitv main aane kii prakriya badalon jaisi hi hoti he
 Cold air is able to take more moisture than hot air and it absorbs moisture through evaporation
 ye vah badal hota he jo bhoomi ke nikat banataa he
 That is, the part of a cloud which is stationed in the air above the ground is not a fog but the part of the cloud which comes in contact with the upper ground is called a fog
 iske atirikt koharaa kai anya tareekon se bhi banataa he
 But most of the fog turns into two categories, advection fog and radiation fog
 donon hi prakaar main koharaa aam hawa se adhik thanda mahasoos hota he
 This is due to the moisture particles filled in it
 advection fog tab banataa he jab garm hawa kaa ek vishesh hissaa kisi nam pradesh ke upar pahunchataa he
 Sometimes the fog is also very dense, which makes it difficult to look away
 samudr kinare rahane vaale log advection fog se parichit hote hai
 Radiation fog occurs when the top layer of the earth is cold
 aisa praayah shaam ke samay hota he
 As the top layer of the earth cools, the air also cools, causing fog
 koharaa kai pahari ghaatiyon main bhi chaataa he
 There the upper hot air keeps the cold air closer to the ground
 aisa koharaa praayah subah ke samay hota he
 After the sun sets, the cold air heats up and rises
 iske baad se koharaa chantnaa shuru ho jaataa he

 But the importance of Maharana Kumbhakarna is more due to his cultural work than victory

 isaki yatra avadhi he 25 ghante 55 minute
 The six decades of 1960 to 2010 can be said to be important for the modern art of Rajasthan for two reasons
 ek to yah ki is interval main bahuterey ullekhneey chitrakaaron kaa kaam saamne aayaa or duusare yah ki yahan ke kuch chitrakaaron ne rashtriya str par apni pahchaan banane ke liye nihaayat moulik, apni nijee chitrabhasha bhi ijad kii
 It was during these years that teaching and teaching of arts at the university level also started
 kala ke kshetra main shodh or anusandhan bhi isi avadhi main zyada saamne aa paae
 Today, there are probably more than three hundred painters of small and big 'modern' style in Rajasthan, but it is possible to mention briefly those artists whose works have their own charitic-privacy if not in 'kathaya', notation
 i definitely do
 bharat main aise chitrakaaron kii sankhya bahut adhik nahin, jinhone apane praayah puure kala-jivan main keval jyamithik roopakaron ko lekar hi kaam kiya ho, par nihsandeh mohan sharma kii jagah aise hi logon main thi
 Born in Nathdwara, a town in Chittor, the works of Mohan Sharma continue to depict a 'utopian' urban system that is illuminated by the divine light of fantasy
 1966 se laga kar apni antim kriti tak mohan sharma ne jin jyamithik roopakaron ko srijan kaa aadhaar banaaya, ve roopakar mahanagar ke paardarshee sannaaton ko pratidhwanit karne main kaamyaab hue, jinka nilvarni swapnil maahaul mohan sharma ke achetan main bahut gahare paith gaya maaloom hota tha
 Constantly conscious of the basic truths of painting, length, width, depth, distance, light and shadow, Mohan Sharma's creations continued to create picturesque geometric figures - which we can see by standing with a cheat
 yadi inke kaam ko koi ‘sthool‘ pahchaan dena chahen, to ham kah sakate hai ki antatah ye kritiyaan ‘ghanavaad‘ kaa hi naveen roopaantaran hai
 From the beginning of 1970 and after that Mohan Sharma painted the series titled 'cosmic-crystals', we have seen a world of imagination and artistry in which today's metropolis-sense has emerged sharply
 ye keval deevaaron, chauraahon or galiyon kii saamaanya yaa chaltau abhivyakti nahin he, apitu aakaaron se thasathas bhari kisi mahanagareey jindagi ke jivant aks hai
 There are signs of highways, flyovers, and bridges, where there is a strange andravelous flicker of lights and darkness
 kahin khidakiyon kii aankhon se jhaankati roshni kaa dhundhala sa sira hamaare haath lagata he or achaanak dub jaataa he, yah sab jaise ek mayalok hissaa he, jahaan rangon kii rahasyavadita ke daine, nagar-aakaaron ko apane agosh main band lenaa chaahate hai
 Mohan Sharma was present as a ready-made craftman by 'fusing' the acrylic colors, securing their brilliance and 'divinity' and spreading them on the face of a colorful halo
 mohan sharma kii chitra duniya itani ekaantik or stabdh he ki maanviya spandan kaa koi sutara kalpanasheel soundarya se bhari is sristi main vichaarte hue hamaare haath nahin lagata
 After a period, the flattering, inertia and the beautiful solitude of his paintings shatters us from within because there is no character in his well-crafted theater
 is arth main mohan sharma goonjte akelepan ke vaastushilpi the
 The sense of civility in the paintings of Mohan Sharma emerged as brilliantly - perhaps not in the works of any Rajasthan painter
 vah apni choti, kintu sarthak jindagi main jyamiti kii ungali tham kar hamen mahanagar kii uchaat aatma tak le jane kii koshish karte rahe
 Mohan believed that now in the village world, when it is not possible near us to return to its sacred past, then why can't the images of present-life and the symbol of modern civilization remain the inspiration for creation? When the geometrical world of man-made architecture is an indispensable reality for contemporary societies, is it not a kind of mental exodus to move art towards the 'imaginary' village? yah bhi ek ajeeb baat hi kahi jaaegi ki manushya kii bhautik nirmitiyon ke prati mohan sharma jitne samvedansheel or ashanvit the, utani hi berukhi or aruchi unhen kala main-manushya kii upasthiti se thi
 He considered the world of civilization created by man as a fine example of his creative abilities, but he never found the presence of man in canvas to be suitable
 mohan maanate the ki aadhunik aadmi bheetar se nitant swaarthee, krur or badsoorat he
 The best side of it is still its creation — a replica of which can be seen in the dams created by holding vast watersheds, the infinite sprawl of cement-concrete, and the diverse forms of urban progress that touch the sky
 ‘‘aisa nahin ki meri dilchaspee ‘aadmi’ main nahin, par main apni swayan kii image, niraashaa or asantosh se itnaa ukta gaya hoon ki mujhe dar he ki chitron main aise aadmi kii upasthiti unhen badsoorat na kar de xxrep 4 
 ’’ mohan sharma ne apane ek catalog main likhaa bhi tha
 Apart from city experiences in his paintings, there is also a pleasant presence of 'real-life' - tea tables, vases, cups, kettles, fruits and other things with the help of windows, which he also used to keep the image in his canvas
 aisa lagata he jaise ‘thos’ yahan kuch he hi nahin, sab kuch kaanch sa paardarshee or ghulaa-mila he, jiske bheetar prakaash or chaaya kii manohar aavritiyaan hai
 In this sense, his abstraction is not 'formless', because he wanted to keep us attached to some eye-reality
 suza ne likhaa he, mohan sharma main -‘‘ghanvaadee sanrachanaon kii ullekhneey samaj he
 "for the first time, seeing his portrait, Hemant Shesha remembered the works of Lionel Finder, but Souza believes that" instead of 20th-century German cubism, the work of Mohan Sharma is rooted in the temple of the sixteenth century Chamunda Devi Basoli
 Are more closely related to the artifacts
 ’’ The 'craftsmanship' that has been praised everywhere in Mohan Sharma's creations is due to the well-worn shades of colors and the sharpness of the geometric shapes
 1976 or baad kii inaki kritiyon main parivartan ke kuch ek spasht chinh dekhe ja sakate hai
 The biggest is that their designs are not as dense and chunky as they used to be in the previous art-era
 1976 ke baad kii inaki rachanaaon kaa shilp apekshaakrit saral hua
 For this reason, some new experiences of depth and perspective entered
 rangon ke fusion kii takanic yahan bhi he, parantu baad ke daur kii kritiyon main mohan sharma ek vishisht tarah ke sarleekaran kii ore badhate dikh padate the
 Did this thing finally come in his painting and not only indicate deep maturity? duusari pramukh baat yah he ki 1976 ke baad unke kathanak bhi kinchit badale hue hai
 Moving away from mere repetition of walls and buildings, they made choices — walks or scenes of the natural world, most prominent of them — the sea and the desert
 kalakaar kii aankh se dekhen to samudr or registan main koi antar he hi nahin
 They are synonymous for art purposes
 donon main ek anant bhav he
 They both bind us with the pleasure of being seen
 yahan registan yaa sagar kaa vistaar kshitij tak failaa hua he or kai baar to aisa lagata he jaise vah nissim he yaa drushti-path se aage bhi vah sajiv he
 There are signs of walks and ships in the works of this period of Mohan Sharma
 prasangvash yahan yah bhi likhnaa sangat hoga ki chitravkash ko lekar bhi ek sajag-bhav inke man main tha
 An attempt has also been made to use its texture of canvas here
 ‘‘main kala ko maansik shanti or santulan kii abhivyakti kaa jariya maanata hoon xxrep 4 
 ‘‘ mohan kaha karte the
 In fact, among our mature artists, his compositions provide an opportunity to see some persistence and nafees regarding the subject and its subsistence
 rangaton kaa shaleen istemaal or sateek brashawork mohan sharma kii nijee khubiyaan thim- jiske sahare unhone apana ek alag muhaavara viksit kiya
 Perhaps that is why Suja saw Mohan Sharma as 'a sequel' to the art-consciousness of 'pag' in India and appreciated it again and again
 yah samakaleen chitrakala ke liye durbhagyapurna tha ki mohan sharma achaanak hamaare bich se chale gaye
 He was hopeful for life till his last breath while fighting a deadly disease like cancer and more than that he would be able to recover and draw again
 par aisa hona bada na tha
 Even though Mohan Sharma is not there today, what he has left in memory for his fans and acquaintances - those are some of the works that hypnosis may be less than the best work of prospective newcomers, completely finished
 It cannot happen
 vidyasagar upaadhyaay kaa naam bhartiya aadhunik kala ke maidan main janaa pahachaanaa he
 He is known for his dark-white intangible creations
 shailigat vishishtita ke kaaran bhi vidyasagar un rachanakaaron main rahe hai, jinhone apni kala ke liye rajya se baahar bhi ek kala-sangraahak or prekshak-varg taiyaar kiya he
 Vidyasagar started drawing with pencil drawings and from 1968 to 1976, he continued drawing only in pencil due to constant means and sense
 is kaarykaal main unki priy pencil thi-3-bi, jiskaa saghan prayog karte hue inhone apane madhyam kii komal samvedansheeltaa se rishta kaayam kiya
 Here, the spread of black-white shapes on the paper is produced by successive strokes of the pencil, in which the nuances and bulk of the lead are made at some places
 haalaanki keval pencil kii rangaton kaa pradarshan hi inkaa ekmaatr abhisht nahin, parantu chalate-chalaate kai dfa ham aisa ahsaas paa jate hai jaise vah pencil kii ‘kamaniyata’ or iske jaldi-jaldi badal jane vaale mizaaj ko hi apni kritiyon main giraftaar karnaa chaah rahe hon
 Vidyasagar's pencil is also proven to create a dark atmosphere
 vah bakhubi jaanati he ki lagaataar ghisaai kaagaj par kitna prabhaavshaalee kaalaapan rach sakati he
 Whatever the metaphor Vidyasagar has produced on paper in his pencil illustrations created in large numbers are abstract - nowhere near the real-world effects of the world, but like the tangible sensations of darkness, of the complex world of the unconscious Image
 andhkaar or lagaataar bana rahane vaala koi rahasy hi in rekhaankanon kaa mul bhav he
 Vidyasagar creates darkness through black designs and also attempts to take us into a strange kind of lyricalness, mysticism and deep sensory resolution
 unke aarmabhik kaam main tantra-chitron kii samvednaa mukhar he
 Somewhere in such works, we sit with sexual symbols or genitals and sometimes reach them with the help of buried symbolism
 prakaash inaki rachanaaon main unmukt bhav se nahin upja, lekin jahaan bhi vah upasthit he, lagaataar apane astitv kaa bhaan karwaata chalata he
 In the midst of the magical mystery of darkness, even the flame of dim to dim light creates a fascination for itself — similarly the lightness of the empty white space evokes a distinct sensation in their underlines
 kabhi apane ‘compojishan’ ke saanche main sakaaran istemaal karne, kabhi prekshak ko aashcharyamishrit prafullata main daalane ke liye inhone texchar ko kaagaj kii peeth se ubhaara he
 Hence, there are many reasons for his interest in taxpayers - from the intrinsic demand of 'subject' to only skill and complacency
 par ullekhneey yah he inke chitron ke bhitari anushaasan ko bigaadane main texcharon ne kabhi bhi apni simaaon kaa atikaraman nahin kiya
 Wherever they are, they are polite and courteous and despite their 'being' are not so 'verbose' as to damage the internal strength of the pictures
 pencil rekhaankanon kii shrinkhalaaon main upaadhyaay ne udaipur ke bahut se kalakaaron kii tarah hi, apane liye jyamithik-sanrachana kii raah pasand kii thi or inaki aarmabhik kritiyaan zyaadaatar ‘cantral-compozishan’ main hi banaai gai hai
 After 1976, Vidyasagar moved away from pencils and resorted to a new color medium acrylic and even today he is working in it
 unka madhyam main badlaav yah soochna to detaa he ki ‘madhyam’ ke rudh ho jane kaa ahsaas unke achetan main tha, kintu lagbhag vahi kathy, ve hi roopakar or vahi kendriya-sangyojan hamen inke chitron main kaagaj kii bajaae canvas par aarambh ke kuch varshon main utraa miltaa he
 In this sense, Vidyasagar's medium change until 1978 was not a 'creative' change
 yah mahaj kala-saamagree kaa badlaav hi tha
 1978 and after this Vidyasagar appeared before us with a new composition
 apane roodhiyon or kathanak se hat kar vah jo nai cheez laae, vah thi-prakruti
 Whether they are images of mountains, clouds, rivers, and rocks, or other scenes, he has renounced the content and geometry of the former to underline the hilly and rocky typology — between which they have lived for a long time
 ‘‘mere liye yah aavashyak nahin ki koi anubhav thik usee shakl surat main kala main aae yaa prayukt ho
 One experience connects and transforms with another experience or many experiences
 koun si cheez rachana-karm main kab or kis tarah kaam aati he-bahut pechida baat he
 i have said the same thing many times
 jaise ‘pebles’ ko apni bahut si rachanaaon main chitrit kiya or man bhar kah lene ke baad phir kisi duusare anubhav ko uthaa liya
 Impressions of fish, ship movements, 'flying birds' or 'flying rocks' have also come in my paintings
 ’’ vidyasagar batalaate hai
 From these free and free works, where their old theme monotony has dissolved, these black-white illustrations and oil paintings take us - to the mountainous experiences that fascinate them because of their unevenness and independent existence
 pencil ke alaava acrilik rangon ke inke chitron main ham drishyon ke najadik jate hai-is anubhuti ke sahare ki ye pahaad or chattaane amoort, andhkarpurn hote hue bhi hamen baandh sakane kaa bhav apane main sanjoe hai
 Here we also see nature, which has been his latest subject - has happened in a sensible space-combination
 kaagaj yaa canvas kii safed sataha ko apane avkaash ke liye baratane or chhodane kaa kaushal bhi yahan he
 Some times he seems to be immersed in the desire to express his lyrical or biotic-looking motifs through a certain type of grouping
 nadi kinare ke gol-gol pattharon, akaash ke dhabbon or patharon ke sudur bimbon ko pakadati inaki kritiyaan hamen asal-kathy se itar bhi prakruti kii prishthbhumi ke alok yaa dhundhalkon kaa parichay detii hai
 Therefore, as the role of the things which have come to the forefront, Vidyasagar is also interested in marking his background and in fact this is the secret of the entirety of these visualizations
 upaadhyaay ke chitron kii ek or visheshta kaa ullekh karnaa yahan aprasangik na hoga
 That specialty is the study of colors
 kaale-safed kii ekresata ke swaad ko, canvas ke eksepan ko jo cheez bhang karti he, ve hai-rangaten
 There are many types of shades - liquid, medium, dark and dense
 rangaton kii vajah se hi ham chitron main ek khaas tarah ke anubhav kii vividhta se judate hai
 He evokes perspective in scenes and the relative distances between things
 vidyasagar upaadhyaay ke rekhaankanon par suparichit kathakaar or sameekshak ashok aatreya kii yah tippanee bhi mahatvapurn he-‘‘ xxrep 5 
 unke bachapan ke sanskaron main bhi aravali-shrinkhalaaon kaa sthaan kam mahatvapurn nahin rahaa
 The new paintings of Vidyasagar, it seems, present seductive scenes of intimate interviews of the mountains
 unamem sammohan jagaane vaali kushalta he
 Thus, these pictures do not give any 'graphic' experience of the mountains at any level, but at the level of extreme privacy, their privacy seems to open the layers of secrets
 kahin-kahin par lagata he jaise ve kisi vishaal kaali raatri ke dainon ke samaan akritiyaan kaat kar banaae gaye hai
 He makes full use of his medium and wears it on paper until he achieves the deep satisfaction expected from him
 vah apni style main ek shramik kii nishtha rakh kar vah sammohan jagaa dete hai ki prakruti apni baari-bharkam mudra banane ke baavjood ek sahajata, ek rahasy liye khadi rahati he
 xxrep 4 
 In Vidyasagar, where there is a heavy mind like a mountain, it also provides relaxation to its observer and thus it seems that he has set out alone in a journey, where he has the conditions to find the 'stop'
 pencil ke vishaal belanaakaar, gol, ticone, tikhe, ghumaavdaar, sidhe or oonche-neeche aise kai padaavon kii ore vidyasagar apane shilp ke madhyam se sanket karte hai, ki yatra thakaane yaa ubaane vaali prathit hoti
 xxrep 4 
 ek baar poochne par ki keval syah-safed main hi chitra kyon banaate rahe hai, vidyasagar upaghyay ne kaha tha- ‘‘ meraa maananaa he ki keval rangon se hi kalakaar kaa vyaktitv nahin banataa
 i do not use colors as artists usually do, but i see and use black-white tones as the colors of nature
 pencil ko shuru main ek tarah kii rachanaatmak majaburi main thama tha, par dhire-dhire kaala safed hi meri abhivyakti kaa abhinn ang ban gaya
 Even today the mind is not full of it, so i am continuing to work in it xxrep 4 
 '' kintu baad main rangon ke sammohan ne vidyasagar jaise chitrakaar ko bhi apni taraf khinch hi liya, jo sirf kaale or safed ko hi apni pehali abhivyakti maanate rahe the
 Although Vidyasagar did not enter the discipline of colors all of a sudden, moving from black to white has been a major revolutionary change for him
 udhaaharan ke liye ham in rangamay canvaason main prakruti kii vibhinn mudraon ko ek puraane sammohan kii hi tarah, chitra falak par utraa hua dekh sakate hai
 In these paintings, Vidyasagar has transformed trees, mountains, rocks, clouds and rocks
 yahan bhure, pile, kaale or duusare halke rangon kii rangaten hai
 Taking the shelter of their liquid sensations, these colors lead an observer to the vast nature of nature and its constantly changing synthetic shapes
 rangon ke chayan ko vidyasagar apni is nai chitra-shrunkhlaa ke liye kaaphi urjaadaayak maanate hai
 His idea is also that "in these colors i can find such a liquid, transparent and sensitive creation, which would probably be relatively difficult to express in any other medium
" vah in chitron main apni puraani kathavstu ko naye dhang se kehane ke pakshdhar hai
 One of the specialties of these paintings is that Vidyasagar Upadhyay's familiar portrait-posture, especially the black and white investigations, do not end here
 ve apane parichit chakshush-soundarya ko barkaraar rakhte hue atyant taral or halke rangon or unki rangaton ko kholte hai
 a special urge in his mind towards painting and natural forms is about its vastness, he expresses it by choosing large size canvas
 yaho bahut sara avkaash he-ek nirvaat jaisaa, jisamen prakruti ke roopakar rangon ke bich ubhar rahe hai
 They have long-sighted scenes and figures of differential images
 prakruti ke vishaal swaroop ko yahan saghanikrut kiya gaya he
 Depth of perspective, plot texture and texture humidity can be seen in them
 is rangeen kritiyon main vidyasagar paryaapt kaavyatmak or samvedanpurn bane rah sake hai
 These canvasses have a structure in them - a geometric rhythm and motion, which is like a pre-notice of the great changes in the shapes
 layaatmakataa ke prati unki lagan or prakruti ko lekar chaaya rahane vaala anuraag vidyasagar ke man main kai varshon se he
 In his new paintings he seems to be approaching this attachment
 baarik tantuon or kaali rekhaon kii sakriy upasthiti se vah hamaare saamne roopakaron ke bheetar upasthit rahane vaali choti, kintu maheen or sakriy samvednaaon ko bhi kholte hai
 Now their designs are no longer formal, they seem to be far-fetched in the smooth dynamics of nature and its inner emotions
 is prakaar ke mukt aakaaron main jahaan prakruti kii abhivyakti ke liye nae dharaatal upje hai, vahiin kai baar inke jarurat se zyada ‘angadh‘ ho jane ke khatre bhi saamne aae hai, kintu ek banate hue chitra-sansar main ye sab baaten adhik mahatv kii nahin hai
 Vidyasagar Upadhyay deserves our praise as a distinguished artist among the painters who work continuously
 or ham, unki kritiyon main har nae rachana-padaav ke prati ashanvit
 Suresh Sharma's oil paintings are examples of colors of the same color and geometry carefully crafted in it
 vah canvas ke vishaal spes main khud apana arth talashti rangaton ke chitrakaar hai, jinke yahan ‘niraakaar‘ ke prati teevr vyamoh yaa poorvarag baraabar upasthit rahata aayaa he
 The geometric insistence on the very liquid hidden in the colors of the same one or a few colors produced by spraying pure colors and shades gives a different personality to Suresh Sharma's paintings
 yah shubh he ki bhale kuch suprasiddh videshi chitrakaaron se unke chitra-samya ko chhod den, unka kaam rajasthan main rah rahe aadhunik chitrakaaron main bhinn bhi he or ‘saahasik‘ bhi
 In addition to oil paintings, Suresh Sharma has also made sculptural and graphic raids and his experience of working in these three mediums in the development of his art journey is so connected that it is difficult to see it separately
 haalaanki vigat kuch varshon se vah keval tailchitr hi bana rahe hai
 But the work he has done in graphic in the early years is a reflection of his interest and tendency to explore something new in this medium
 suresh sharma kii kala rajasthan main rah rahe duusare bahut saare samakaleen kalakaaron se apane arth or prabhaav main bhinn he
 His creative autonomy is his most notable capital — though he is often accused of being 'unsophisticated' —and that is because of his creations, we should see the new American art stream Ed Ranhard and Joseph Elbers There is a sudden memory of the works of such artists
 yah prabhaav shaayad isliye bhi itnaa paardarshee or spsht he ki vah kuch samay ke liye america main rahe hai
 It is evident that the impression of art-trends there is deep on them
 unke chitron kii yaad rakhane laayak baat yah he ki unka amurtan aakaaron yaa virupan kaa amurtan nahin he- balki vah ‘niraakaar‘ rach kar bhi avaantar se ek duusare bhav-bodh kaa darwaja hamaare liye kholte hai
 There are two characteristics of its paintings
 ek to yah ki apekshaakrit ek vishaal chitra-avkaash inke yahan he duusari yah ki vah keval ‘rangaton‘ par hi kaam karte hai
 The style of 'using' colors is also different in these acrylic paintings
 inhen visheshtaon ko lekar hi unke canvaason ke lakshya anyon se kuch alag hai
 His paintings have sensitive colors, which are all over the face of the spray of colors, like the fog in December
 ve kisi bhi rang kii ho sakati hai- nile, kaale, bangnee yaa kisi or gahare rang kii, par ve saare canvas par ecchhatra samrajya sthapit kiye rahati hai
 Within them there is a sense of twisting and churning
 aisa lagata he jaise dekhte hi dekhte badal apni akritiyaan badal lete hai- shaayad canvas kii ye rangaten bhi usee prakriya main he
 It has a constant vibrancy and vibration
 ve kabhi-kabhi to dhunen kii taral chadar kii tarah puure falak par ‘chaa janaa‘ chaahati hai
 Suresh Sharma wants to save us from the monotony of colors by putting geometric patterns on the canvas only when we see something very lightly and carefully, but these geometrical chambers are so sparse and symbolic that the fluid sensation of the picture is' Do not become a burden
 inke kaam main prishthbhumi or mukhyabhumi jaisi koi avadharana he hi nahin
 Whatever is the background, the same is also present in front of us on the board
 usamen aisa koi bhed nahin ki koun aage he koun si peeche
 This is because it is not the abstraction of any 'shape'
 suresh sharma hamen rangon ke arthpurna prabhaavon ke sahare jaise ek darshanik shunya se saakshaatkaar karwaanaa chaahate hai
 So, standing in front of its canvas, we often expect that maybe a 'bold' color phenomenon will happen on it or we will get to see something 'solid' on the colors - but it never happens
 unke saare chitra hamen duusare tarah ke maun main le jate hai
 It is a silence made from gradations of colors, on which no color phenomenon emerges, just colors flying like mist continue on the canvas
 suresh sharma kii sabase badi uplabdhi yaa ‘saahasikta‘ yahi he ki inhone keval rangon ko hi roopakar ke rup main kaam main liya he
 It would probably be too much with him to say that he has suddenly 'jumped' at his current art-idiom
 unke is niraakaar ke peeche rahi hai kuch yatraayen-graphic or acrilik main, jahaan shuru main duusare kalakaaron hi kii tarah hamen vah ek ‘akruti pradhan‘ amurtan hi main le jane kii koshish main tallin dikh padate the
 This pose was perhaps more pronounced in his graphic impressions
 kintu kramshah unke canvaason se aam taur par najar aane vaali rang-yojanaayen, aakaar or unki samvednaayen lupt hone lageen- or unki jagah le lee- sirf rangon or rangaton ne, rangaten jinako samooche canvas par chhitaka kar vah unke jariye ek sookshmatar ‘bodh‘ hamaare bheetar jagaane kii baat shaayad sochate hon
 May be many of us find this world of Suresh Sharma simplified to a great extent, but in my own view this simplification is a special kind of immortalization
 ek aisa amurtan jo pehali martabaa main itnaa grahya or saamaanya nahin ki chalate-chalaate yaa ‘kejual aproch‘ rakhte hue use ham saraah saken
 To do this, we have to flow with his picture-vision, sometimes parallel, sometimes beyond and beyond
 apni sari rachana-prakriya main astitvvaadi vichaarkon kii tarah hi vah bhi duusare kii upasthiti ko katai jaruri nahin maanate
 This makes it clear why all their art is completely individual and subjective? Why, like most painters, is he not insistent on a shapeless abstraction? jahaan tak suresh sharma ke kaam main jyamithik sanketon kii maujuudagi kaa sawaal he, jaisaa hamane pehle kaha, uskaa asal abhipraay yahi he ki ek to ye varg, chaukhaane yaa samanaantar rekhaayen canvas kii rang ekresata kaa khandan karti hai or doosraa yah bhi ki ve painting ke prati kalakaar ke ek sachet sambandh kaa suchak hai
 The creation of art is no longer an accidental event, rather it becomes an attempt to make the creation-instinct effortlessly into art-object
 ye rekhaaen, varg or jyamithik sanket itane spasht or moortmaan nahin ki ekaek puri rachana par ubhar aaen, balki inkaa dhundhalapan or sanketikta bahudhaa ek alag swaad kaa sammohan hamamen jagaati he
 As much as we try to break away from their presence, this sparse, transparent geometry grows as elusive as it is within us, so it is difficult to appreciate this picture in a straightforward way because of its visualism, especially the macro designs
 There is no solicitation for anything and as we have said, his conscious paranoia towards 'formless' makes him an artist of his own kind of idiom
 unka kaam dekh kar hamen yahi lagata he ki kala main aadhunik hone kaa ek maayna shaayad yah bhi he ki chaalu raterik se alag ham rangon kii vyakaranvihin virat duniya main pravesh kar jaaen or rangaton va rangon ke niraakaar ko hi apana khud ek arth talashne den
 Shabbir Hasan Qazi's work has yet become a stereotype - not because he is currently in the process of identifying his picture-world
 lagaataar kaam karne vaale aise chitrakaaron main unki ginati he jo apane liye gambhirthapurvak koi spasht maarg talash karne kii rachanaatmak uhapoh se guzar rahe hai
 It is his effort that inspires us to discuss his art
 vah 1969 se kaam kar rahe hai or ab tak mul rup se unki dilchaspee kaa vishay rahi he- tantra yaa jyamiti kii kalpanaayen
 Darker colors are more pleasing to them
 vah ek vakt main laal, kaale or hare ko khul kar canvas par lagane vaale chitrakaar the
 In the paintings of the seventies, he had only the intensive use of green
 saare ke saare falak par haraapan mandit hua karata tha, jis par safed kaale or duusare gahare varnon se kuch ‘cycadalic‘ si milti julati kaali-pattiyon or laharon vaale swatantra roopakar the
 Shabbir's early work had a 'commercial' style of abstraction appealing to most eyes, which was very close to the danger of becoming a 'design' at some places
 vah apni kritiyon main aakaaron ke prati itane saavdhaan the ki jyamithik akritiyon kaa canvas par aayojan ek hichak bhare istemaal ke saath karte dikh padate the
 Many of his early works had a particular sense of suspense, confusion and hesitation, and at times seemed to be concerned with his anxiety, reduced to the inner creation of the picture and fulfilling it with attractive color combinations, to 'liberate' him from his obligation
 'it is more to get
 par tip banate chitrankan or jyamiti yaa tantra jaise puraane vishyon ke dohare khatre se khelte hue shabbir ne ekadam nayaa or moulik na sahi par pranjal or aakarshak lag sakane vaala kaam kar kala main pravesh kiya tha
 Like many young painters of Udaipur-school, Shabbir also initially wanted to take his stand on geometry
 jyamiti ke aakarshan ne haalaanki inhen ab bhi apane main baandh rakhaa he- par idhar ke kaam main jyamiti ke sandarbh puraane nahin hai- ve kadaachit parivartit or parvardhit hai
 Her inertia is breaking and now she seems to be part of the world of paintings
 shabbir kii 1975 or aasapaas ke varshon kii rachanaaon main kaam or aadhyatm ke kuch ati parichit pratik hai- camel, stri-yoni, chandra, netra, andhkaar vagairah jinako jyamiti ke anushaasan main piroyaa gaya he
 In these paintings, Shabbir has used sex-symbols to create or change his composition of the picture
 kabhi-kabhi inhen dekh kar gulam rasul santosh ke chitron ke puraane tantra kii smriti taaja ho aati thi
 But all these things usually happen with a becoming painter
 shabbir hasan kaaji ke tantric-pratikon ko le kar banaae in chitron main ek craftsman kaa kaushal sarvatra he
 There is a plan and a devotion among them
 vah mehnat se rang lagane ke pakshdhar hai
 The designs in his paintings are more solid and rectangular than before
 ve jyamithik sanrachanaon main tej rangon ke bich sthapit hai
 There is a role of Prakash and Ujas somewhere between them
 inhen dekh kar aisa lagata he jaise koi thos cheez dhoosar or taral ho rahi ho
 In Shabbir's work of this time, it would be too much to find any clear cosmic images, but imagine the figures of birds or flying airplanes can be identified
 ‘hard-aij‘ ke ye saaf suthere hisse kahin-kahin bahut kaavyatmak hai
 They have a poignant fluidity despite the presence of warm colors
 rangon ke fusion yaa rangaten banane main shabbir hasan, mohan sharma jaise kalakaaron se peeche jarur hai- par vah bhi is baat kii koshish main tallin najar aate hai ki gahare yaa mul rangon se khub acchhee tarah bhare canvas kii sthirataa yaa jadta main thodi si ‘halchal‘ paidaa karne ke liye halki, kintu samvedansheel gulabi yaa pili rangaten ‘ugi hui‘ najar aaen
 These shades can be a sign of light for us taking some shape, which despite being less able to attract our attention
 hare or laal ke alaava kaale or bangnee main bhi shabbir ne bahut sa kaam kiya he
 In his early work, perspective-consciousness is not so vocal, but in later times he also starts giving the feeling of being aware of this art reality
 shuru ke lok-alankaran kii si sapaat anvitiyon yaa kaale safed chaukhaanon or pattiyon ke cycadalic istemaal ke baad unhone chitron ne ek alag karavat lee or vah kaale ke madhyam se koi rahasy, vishaad yaa andhkaar khadaa chaahate hai
 'blackness' is also very much in a painter like Vidyasagar, but the darkness of Shabbir's paintings is very romantic and colorful
 unke chitron ko dekh kar aisa lagata he jaise andhere kamare main koi mehataab jala rahaa ho
 Similar sensations exist in his picture series 'shamaan'
 canvas ke avkaash main inke yahan roopakar jis style main rache gaye the vah dekhnaa bhi rochak he
 Previously, they were connected to each other by images of strips or floors - they remained independent and separate from each other in the middle art phase, now they are combined with calligraphy or script signs
 inaki nai rachanaaon main do vishesh pravritiyaan hai- ek to yah ki yahan farsi kii kellingraphy pravisht ho rahi he or duusari yah ki ab rangon kaa mizaaj bahut kuch badla hua he
 The color is not as bold and straight, but there is a mixture of dense melancholy in them
 yah prakriya kuch-kuch aisi hi he, jaise manch kii tej roshni ko badalane ke liye natyagrih main arcllamp ke saamne jilatin kaagaj laga diya jaataa he
 We can see this change in Shabbir in the continuity of the mood of his paintings
 parivartan, kalakaar main ek khaas muhaavarey main kaam karne or uski sambhaawanaaon ko uker lene ke baad aana sahaj or swaabhaavik he
 Even here, though the change is slow and gradual and there is a journey of pictures behind it, it is also easy to understand it easily
 khaas taur par unke liye jo kabhi shabbir ko chatkh jyamiti or ‘optical ilugen‘ paidaa karne vaale ek kalakaar ke rup main dekhte or jaanate aae hai
 " xxrep 5 
 This calligraphy of Persian did not come only in pictures like calligraphy, but some of my other experiences behind it are also related
 maine pichley saalon main aadhyatm kii duniya ko pahchaanane kii koshish kii he
 Like a 'bande', i am excited to get a closer look at the life-philosophy and personality of Sufi Peers' 


 says Shabbir
 ‘‘pataa nahin achaanak jane kaise mujhe dharm or aadhyatm main gahari ruchi paidaa hui or isi junun main main is arase main sufiyon ke saannnidhya main rahaa bhi hoon xxrep 5 
 sufiwaad kii sari ‘feeling‘ hi amoort he‘‘ xxrep 5 
 shabbir hasan kaa vichaar he
 In some of his paintings he seems to be moving closer to this 'realization'
 haraa rang to pehle se hi inaki rachanaaon main islamic dharmik samvednaa ke rup main upasthit rahaa he, parantu apni ek chitra shrinkhalaa main bhi vah hare or kaale ko vah apni puri damak or moulikta main prayukt karte the, ab rangon kii chamak ko dhire-dhire kam karke vah apane kathanak kii gaharaai ke najadik le ja rahe hai
 Darkness, according to them, signifies creation or 'ignorance' in the pictures, in which the divine light is hidden
 ‘‘meri rachanaaon kaa kaala rang negative nahin he, balki usamen bhi jivan he
 "shabbir believes that even in pure geometry, he did not enjoy the pleasure that was in the new paintings taken with the Ananda religious or 'sufi' conception
" jyamiti kii simaaon se parichit hone ke baad ab shabbir main use us puraane arth main prayukt karne kaa utsaah nahin he or vah kaaphi mukt roopakaron ko apane canvaason par laa rahe hai
 As the next step of such paintings, now Shabbir has started painting trees, flowers and similar shapes, perhaps once again expressing his interest in nature
 yadi in chitron kaa vishay prakruti he, to inaki abhivyakti ke liye yahan vah jyamithik or swatantra roopakaron ke sangyojan kii koshish karte hai
 Like his earlier spiritual disciplines created earlier, although his initial urges towards geometry are weak, he was not completely free from geometry
 prakruti ko lekar taiyaar is canvaason main aadhaar-rangon ke saath jyamithik akritiyaan bhi badastoor dikhalaai padati hai
 These geometric shapes in the canvas are just a foundation for the main amphitheater, it is not their intention to discover the beauty of geometry
 yahan rangon kaa gaharaa aalep he, kintu ek kaushal ke saath
 In these pictures of Shabbir Hasan, we see black, green, red, blue and some similar warm colors, which is important in terms of creating a perfect background and then giving a suitable place to his plot on it
 aisa lagata he ki vah nirantar mul rangon se hi kaam lenaa chaahate hai
 In these paintings the marking of the figure is planned and employed
 shabbir ke banaae phool yaa vriksh jis rang-lok kaa hissaa hai, vah sambhavtah pratyaksh main dikhalaai nahin de sakate
 It may seem that we are seeing these flowers in a dark dream or a half-asleep
 yah ek ullekhneey parivartan he or inke canvaason main ab ek nae padaav kii anugunj sunai pad rahi he
 Fragmented images of human figures have come up in his recent work
 aakarshak rang-prayog or takanic main siddhi inaki ullekhneey visheshtaayen hai, jiske sahare ham shabbir hasan kaaji jaise chitrakaaron se or gahari aashaaen rakh sakate hai
 Like literature, regionalism is also a major inspiration for art
 shaayad isliye ki lok jivan main hi apana sudurtam ateet dhundh sakate hai
 The primitive roots of our city-consciousness tree are finally in the villages, so in the pictures and illustrations of Bhavnishankar Sharma, we have to roam around and interview the rural-world scenes in some way, so it is not an unnatural phenomenon
 vah hamaare liye adal-badal kar rajasthan ke gaanv kii drushyavali ke bimb laate hai
 These can be images: peacocks, huts, their ornate doors, fences and rags, niches, windows and trees
 pichley kuch varshon se bhavanishankar ‘gaanv‘ ke prati ek rachanashil samveg se jude hue hai- uskaa chitratmak sarleekaran karte hue vah hamen kam se kam rangon main aanchalik drishyon kii sarvavyaapaktaa main le jane kaa aagrah karte hai
 He draws directly on the canvas with black ink
 apekshaakrit bade aakaar main pent kiye safed canvas kii spes ko vah syaahi ke sakriy rekhankan se bharte hai
 The presence of vegetation or entangled vines and trees, which are part of the construction of the scene, is also the artisan's gesture to the huts and hot plots: a fluid expression of rural scenery, something that can be identified
 Is made up of well-known symbols
 graamy-sristi ko hi le kar chitrankan karne vaale duusare parichit varisht kalakaar udaipur ke pi
en
choyal se bhavani shankar ke chitra-abhipraay bahut kuch alag hai
 In the zonal world of PN Choyal, huts, old rainy, sweaty walls, trees and doors are intertwined with each other, stagnating in a strange colored haze
 ve kahin tehre hue bhi, pighalate or behate hue dikh padate hai
 They have a noticeable humidity, but Bhavani Shankar is not as symbolic and misty
 vah bahut kam rekhaon main sidhe-sidhe hamen aanchalik-jivan kaa bodh karana chaahate hai
 Bhawanishankar has also produced graphic raids, mostly studies of peacocks
 1970 or aasapaas ke saalon main nirmit in chhaapon main ham chizon ko bilkul vaisaa nahin dekhte jaisi ve hai, balki unki vyaktigat rachana-drushti ke madhyam se baahar aate-aate ve hamen kinchit badali si najar aati hai
 But not even to the extent that they make us seem innocent or strangers
 simit virupan ke saath in chhaapon main moron or murgon kii akritiyaan, unki gati or vibhinn mudraayen hai
 There are many peacocks in Vanasthali, where he lived and worked
 mor, vanasthali viapeeth kii ashram samskruti kaa ang rahe hai
 In the illustrations, Bhavani Shankar tries to catch each 'ada' of peacocks
 vah naachte, thirakate, prem karte, ladate or chalate hue moron kii mudraaen ankit karte hai
 His study of peacocks is somewhat different from his father-painter Devkinandan Sharma
 in rachanaaon main vah gaiyr-paramparaagat andaaj main apane kala-guru or pita se bhinn, moron ke chaak-chauband, udaan ke liye tatpar yaa kute ke hamale se aahat swaroop ko yathasambhav kam or arthjanak rekhaon main vyakt karte hai
 These compositions have abstractly depicted the moving motif of peacock in etching, offsets, lithographs or woodcut techniques
 rekhaon main teji or takanic kii saadagi in chhaapon kii visheshtaayen kahi ja sakati hai
 a remarkable change can be seen in the works of Bhawanishankar in 1975 and beyond
 vah yah ki unki dilchaspee main na keval kuch or vishay daakhil hue hai, apitu is daur main graphic ke alaava bhi vah telarangon ko bhi apni chitrabhivyakti kaa madhyam banaate hai
 Although the presence of peacocks in his compositions of this period is occasionally intact, but he also brings the color and energy of Rajasthan's public life, fairs and regional world colors
 unke is daur ke chitron kii ek gauratlab khaasiyat he-chitravkash kaa upyog
 Bhawanishankar does not create clouds on the entire board
 vah uske ek bhaag ko prekshak kii kalpana ke liye adhuraa sa bhi chhodte hai
 This emptiness of the canvas is not an emptiness, but within it also exists an invisible composition, which is the spread or expansion of the visible tangible
 ham khaali jagah ke bheetar bhi chhipe hue drushyon ko anubhoot kar sakate hai
 For example, in the pictures related to the fairs of Rajasthan, humanities for them are really just color perception
 vahaan meley main jamaa bheed thode se laal nile pile or kaale rang-dhabbon ke jariye upjaai gai he
 Standing at the back of a fair connected on a river bank, like a cinematographer looking at the entire scene from the 'wide angle', he wants to create images of Rajasthan's fairs indicating 'distances'
 aise kuch chitron main canvas kaa puraa hissaa upyog main nahin laayaa gaya, kintu ’nirvaat’ main bhi kuch ’hone’ kaa bhav sannihit he
 This is a creative capital of his paintings
 vigat arase main bhavanishankar sharma ne ek or shrunkhlaa par kaam aarambh kiya tha, jisamen vah aaj bhi rachanaayen kar rahe hai
 Here he presents a combination of two opposite sensations
 prakruti, jaisaa hamane pehle kaha, aadhunik chitrakaaron ke nikat ek bahut arthpurna sarokaar he
 Bhawanishankar also derives from his structures of vegetation or nature
 jaise jangal kii belon or mukt tahaniyon ko vishaal or kathor shilakhand aage badhane se nahin roak pate, vaise hi ‘hard aij‘ kii thos jadta ko bheetar se tod kar baahar jaati hui gatiman vanaspati chitron main apni upasthiti lagaataar darj karti he
 The black concrete geometric blocks symbolize 'mater' or physical matter in them, through which the vegetation is automatically taking a shape, symbolizing indomitable life from the cracks
 vanaspati is jagah chetana yaa ‘konshasanas‘ ko hi bimbit karti he
 a dynamic consciousness whose continuity and strength is embedded in it so that it can maintain its life, despite all the obstacles! The pictures in this series are mixed-medium, with a mixed use of ink and oil colors on canvas
 canvas ke ek bhaag main, vah jahaan sadhe kaushal se adhiktar syaahi rekhankan ke sahare vanaspati kii bunaavat kaa ankan karte hai, vahiin sidhe brush se us par angadh or gahare rang aghat lagaate hai
 This breaks the traditional romanticism of composition, while it is also an attempt to put two different poles of composition together 
 in rachanaaon main bhavanishankar maanav-akritiyon ke prati utane aagrahashil nahin, kintu prayaas karne par prekshak unke roopakaron main chaaron ore se ghire hue aadmi kii chhaviyaan pakshi jaisi akritiyaan or vrikshon ke bimb khoj saktaa he
 Like the work done in miniatures, he often draws with black ink on canvas
 saghan or uljhi hui amarbelein jaise ek duusare main guthim samooche vriksh kii satta par chaa janaa chaahati hai, vaise hi inke chitron main lataayen or vrikshon kii daaliyaan gatiman ho kar agrasar hoti si jaan padati hai
 He is mostly engrossed in promoting his designs
 isliye unki is series kaa sheershak agar ‘flowering of form‘ he to yah asangat nahin
 i begin my talk with the metaphors found in nature
 rachana kii andaruni jarurat ke anusaar roopakar badalte hai
 i too simplify or dematerialize them according to the picture-resolution



 ”says Bhavani Shankar

 lekhan, khaas taur par kahani ke kshetra main vah paanch kahani sangrahon or ek kavita-sangrah ke lekhak hai
 He first went to Meerut in his early teacher period, later joined teaching at the College of Art, Lucknow
 1964 main vah rajasthan main snatkottar str par kala kaa adhyaapan shuru hone ke baad dayanand college, ajmer main praadhyaapak pad par aa gaye or tab inhone yahaan aa kar mausamon, vrikshavliyon, sthaneey pahaado, gharon, jaanwaron, bazaaron, galiyon or rosemara ke drishyon kaa vaash-style main chithran kiya
 Not only did he paint Indian deities in colors, but he also made imaginative paintings based on some poems of Jaishankar 'prasad'
 apane vyaktichitron ko lekar inhen kala-jagat main khaas jagah or pahchaan mili
 Jaiswal in Ajmer created many walks and portraits, touching on the nuances of watercolor depictions, but the influence of the traditional Bengal and Lucknow gharanas on the talent of Ram Jaiswal was more pronounced
 vah hameshaa se ek sundar falak darshak ko uplabdh karaane ke liye sachet rahe hai, bhale hi kathith aadhuniktaa ke naam par unhone ‘street singrs‘ yaa ‘nitijna‘ jaise kuch ek chitra bhi banaae hon
 The transformation of the tradition into new contexts and ways is a notable feature of the current art-trends here
 is khubi ko shail choyal ke chitron main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 If we want to do the classical classification, we get to see a creative transformation of the Mewar style in his works
 vah paramparaagat kalam ke bhawan-shilpon, vanaspati evam unki aantarikta ko apane yahan utaar lenaa chaahate rahe hai
 From the very beginning, he has done such an eye-pleasing work, developing a permanent affection for the prevailing and visualization of miniatures, which we can see in other painters as a 'use' of the tradition
 inke kaam main jo aakarshak rang-yojana evam sangyojan-kshamta he, uskaa sabab yah he ki shail ne parampara ko ek seedhi kii tarah istemaal kiya he
 Both the specialty and weakness of Shail Choyal's paintings is that he, like the miniature styles of traditional art, wants to move us around by a 'gross' visual pleasure
 chaahe vah paramparaagat chitrankan main vyavsaayik taur par utane nirat kalakaar na bhi hon, shail choyal laghuchitron kii si kamaniyata, andrik aakarshan or vishaybaddhata ke aadhaar par hamen adhiktar apane nav-vyavsaayik takaajon tak le jate hai
 As we said earlier, the essential condition of his paintings is visualization
 ve chaahe nayak-nayika ke abhisar-kshan hon yaa unke shayan-kaksh kii antarangataayen; shail choyal apane chitron main aksar ek prashast, par kathanak bhare ekant kii sarjana karne vaale kalakaar ke rup main saamne aate hai
 This self Sannata or Prabha Shah's medieval palaces were not the solitude of the medieval palaces of painters such as Mohan Sharma, but rather the intermittent silence of Shail Choyal, the lack of mewari windows and vents, the transience of palaces and the dense vegetation , Which we have also seen in miniature tradition
 vah apane tailchitron evam graphic chhaapon main jharokhon, sidhiyon, munderon or farshon kii darshneeyata ko surakshit rakhte hue hamen aksar ek rang-birangi ‘nav-saamanti‘ duniya saunp dena chaahate hai
 By looking at his creations, it often seems as if he wants to search for us by hiding scenes within scenes from a swapping perspective
 paribhaasha ke arth main vah keval sairon yaa drushyankanon ke hi chitrakaar nahin hai, par canvas par parvaton, vrikshon or vanaspatiyon kii kamaniyata prakat karte hue shail choyal paramparaagat mewari bhawanon, rajput chhatriyon or alankrita dwaar-paaton kaa prachurtaa se ankan karte hai
 Around this theme Prabha brings the oil paintings of Shah to the observer - images of dignified domes, chhatris and Nafis palaces! The imaginative use of geometry is in Prabha Shah
 ek yaa do rangon kii rangaton kaa adhikadhik prayog karte hue vah rachati hai- rajasthan, jo apane shilp, thethpan or sthapaty ke lihaaj se apratim he
 Udaipur is hidden somewhere in their unconscious
 vah keval telarangon main, rajasthan kii paramparaagat chhatriyon, mehalon or bhawanon ke bimb ubharti hai
 The paintings of Prabha Shah include the lost palaces and buildings in Rangat, Prashant and stunned
 idhar kuch saalon se unka koi kaam pradarshan main nahin dikhaa he
 Udaipur has inspired many painters to paint as a city of Chitropam
 kiran murdia bhi parmanand choyal, chhotulaal, prabhaa shah, shail choyal, abha murdia, charan sharma, hemanth chitrakaar or kai anyon kii tarah hi apane paitruk-shahar udaipur ke 'bhawan-bhugol' se prabhavit hai, par ullekhneey baat yah he ki inamen se har chitrakaar kaa ankan-najariya ek-duusare se bhinn he
 To say Kiran Murdia's paintings also have the presence of Mewadi ranges, paths, trees and palaces, but Kiran's sensation is not as 'simple'
 chitron main kiran murdia bahut kuch anaupchaarik, rachaavpurn evam deshaj hai
 In the depiction of the mountains and the cliffs and the dwellings, the intertwined trees and scenery, they are dense, chic, modern and embellished with Chhotulal, Shail Choyal or Prabha Shah and others
 isi tarah udaipur ko lekar shail choyal jitne safgo to nahin, par haan, puraani peedi ke bahut kalatmak or samvedansheel chitrakaaron main hai, inke kalakaar pita pi

 Mansaram is also one of the most talented and well-known painters born and brought up in Rajasthan, who have been referred to a lot in contemporary art
 kolaj, jyamiti, murtishilp, chhayankan or rachanaatmak lekhan, kai kshetron main pi
 mansaram ne vishisht kaam kar apni jagah nirmit kii he
 Not only did Manasaram take satisfaction with the use of colors on canvas, he gave his painter the opportunity to delve deeper into other mediums as well
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp he ki unhone kuch baras pehle apane janmasthan-mount abu main ek sthai suvidhasampann kaaryshaala chitrakaar-awaas ke taur par shuru kii he
 Panchal Mansaram exhibited the finest creations in India and abroad with the combined use of colors, photography, graphic, computer and photocopy machine
 mount abu ke aravali pahaado, mumbai kii bheedbhad, banaras kii ganga aadi ke alaava hindustan kii aam chhaviyon ko unhone behad kaushal or kalpana se saakaar kiya he
 Mansaram, with the help of his artisan wife Tarunika, has painted his home 'mount' at Mount Abu in an observable place from far away, by painting it with various colors on the huge rocks of Aravali
 har saal vah apane vatan aate hai or apane aap ko samakaleen bhartiya kala kii naveenatam gatividhiyon se jude rakhane ke liye lambi-lambi yatraaen karte hai
 Narayan Acharya has done graphic raids and others have created oil paintings, while P
 Mansaram's art creation is relatively comprehensive
 narayan acharya kaa yogadan graphic madhyam ko apni abhivyakti ke liye chaynit karne ke liye mahatvapurn kaha ja saktaa he, kyonki jab unhone is madhyam ko grahan kiya tha, tab yah utana ‘lokapriy‘ nahin tha
 Charan Sharma used ink and other mixed media in his early works, but in his later art-period he is seen to be present with many interesting memories of the craft of Rajasthan, combined in very large size acrylic colors
 charan sharma ko ham unke naveenatam kaam main apane shahar kii bhawan-smritiyon se nirantar judaa hua kuch us tarah nahin dekhte jis tarah yah baat prabhaa shah or shail choyal kii rachanaaon main he
 Charan's Ardhangini Nimisha Sharma is a very capable modern artist
 charan sharma ke tamaam praarambhik rekhaakannon or tailchitron main bhi sankethik taur par nathdwara upasthit tha
 The surrounding world should be an unbroken part of the painter's senses - it is simple and natural and from this we can see the mewari-bawdis, Kunds and chock-like houses in the early work of Charan Sharma
 thik vaise hi jaise bhavanishankar ke chitron main rajasthani meley-thele yaa vanasthali ke mor
 There are many memories of Rajasthan in Charan Sharma's early work
 charan sharma prarambh main rekhankan or jalarangon main kaary karte the, baad main vah telarangon or acrelic madhyam main utre
 In his later work, Charan embodies the ascetic images of Gautama Buddha in a remarkable depth

 The Neolithic is not a specific chronological period, but rather a set of practical and cultural characteristics that include the use of wild and domestic crops and the use of domesticated animals

 a significant and far-reaching change in human livelihoods and lifestyles was to cultivate the areas where crop cultivation was first introduced: essentially the nomadic hunter-gatherer pre-dependence on livelihood technology or pastoral infancy was first met and its Later, it was replaced by dependence on food produced from farms
 It is also believed that these developments had a significant impact on the development of settlements, as it may be believed that the increasing need to spend more time and effort to prepare the accounts required more localized housing

 In an order of 5-3, the Supreme Court rejected attempts by Congress to restrict the jurisdiction of the courts on the habeas corpus appeal of the detainees of Guantanamo Bay
 The Congress previously approved the Department of Defense's Appropriation Act of 2006 Passed in which section 1005 stated, "procedures for the status review of prisoners outside the United States": 29 sitambar 2006 ko, sabha or seenet ne 65-34 vot se sainya ayog adhinium 2006 ko anumodith kar diya, ek vidheyak jo bandi pratyakshikaran ko kisi aise vyakti ke liye roak degaa jise "gaiyr-kanoonee shatru ladaaku" hona nirdhaarit kiya gaya he jo sanyukt rajya america ke khilaaf yuddh main shaamil tha yaa usne uskaa samarthan kiya tha
 "president Bush signed the Military Commission Act 2006 into law on 17 October 2006
 Declaring a person as an" unlawful enemy fighter "depends on the discretion of the US executive branch of the administration and the right of appeal there No, the result is that this effectively eliminates habeas corpus for any non-citizen

 Bush case
 The Supreme Court refused to hear the acquittal's appeal and upheld the circuit court's decision
 On June 29, 2007, the US Supreme Court overturned its April 2007 ruling and agreed to hear Guantanamo's appeals to detainees seeking a habeas corpus for review

 In a two-on-one decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Court held that the President of the United States did not have the legal authority to detain al-maari without charge; All three judges ruled that al-ma'ari deserves the traditional protection of habeas corpus that grants him the right to challenge his custody in a US court

 is aadesh main kaha gaya ki " paas bandi pratyakshikaran pradesh kaa sanvaidhanik visheshadhikaar he"
 a habeas corpus is an action usually taken after a conviction by a defendant who seeks relief for some alleged error in his criminal trial
 There are a number of post-trial actions and proceedings of this kind, whose differences are potentially confusing, so these require some clarification
 kuch sabase aam, ek apil hai jisamen prativaadee ko, utpreshnadesh pradesh, ek korum nobis pradesh or bandi pratyakshikaran pradesh, kaa adhikaar he
 An appeal, which the defendant possesses, cannot be summed up by a court which, by subscribing to its jurisdiction, is obliged to hear the appeal
 is tarah kii ek apil main, nivedankarta ko aisa mahasoos hota he ki uske mukademe main kuch truti rahi hogi jiske kaaran ek apil aavashyak he
 That premise is an issue of importance on which such an appeal can be filed: Generally as a matter of authority, appeals can only raise issues that were originally raised during the trial
 Any issue which was not originally raised in the case will not be considered in the appeal and will be considered as binding
 There is a convenient test to determine whether a petition is likely to succeed on the basis of errors
 To confirm that a mistake was actually made, an objection to that mistake was made by the lawyer and that the mistake led to the defendant's trial
 Negatively affected
 utpreshnadesh pradesh, aam taur par keval cert ke rup main janaa jane vaala, ucch adaalat dwaara diya gaya ek aadesh he jisamen nichali adaalat ko yah nirdesh diya jaataa he kii vah ek maamle ko record samiksha ke liye bheje or mukadmaa-pashchaat kii prakriya main yah aglaa tarksangat kadam he
 While similar procedures would occur in states, a ruling of certiorari is usually only issued by the Supreme Court in the United States, although some states maintain this process
 uparokt apil ke vipareet, cert kaa ek pradesh adhikaar kaa vishay nahin he
 a petition has to be filed for a state of certiorari, as the High Court issues such orders on a limited basis according to the bond such as time
 In another sense, the order of certs is like an appeal within its boundaries; In this also, relief can be sought on the grounds raised in the original lawsuit
 korum nobis pradesh ke liye ek yachika, maamle ke parinaam par nirnay-pashchaat kaa hamalaa he
 It is awarded in the lower court and claims that there were some mistakes that the court needs to set aside that judgment and / or sentence
 korum nobis pradesh kaa prayog ek adhikaar kshetra se duusare adhikaar kshetra main badalata rahata he
 However, in most jurisdictions it is limited to situations where a direct appeal was not possible before - usually because the issue was unknown at the time of appeal or because the issue could not otherwise be raised on appeal because of procedural constraints
 a common ground for quorum nobis petitions is a claim for incompetent assistance from a lawyer where the alleged incompetence is not shown on court records
 aise maamalon main, sidhi apil aam taur par asambhav he kyonki mahatvapurn ghatnaayen record par dikhaai nahin detii jahaan apiliy adaalat unhen dekh sakati he
