 As a result of the first revolution, the emperor was forced to resign and a temporary government was formed

 The Russian Revolution of 1917 was an important event in twentieth-century world history

 The ideology of scientific socialism propounded by Marx embodied the Russian Revolution for the first time
 is kranti ne samaajawaadee vyavastha ko sthapit kar swayan ko is vyavastha ke janak ke rup main sthapit kiya
 This ideology became so powerful after 1917 that by 1950 almost half of the world had come under it
 kranti ke baad kaa vishwa itihaas kuch is tareeke se gatisheel hua ki yaa to vah iske prasar ke paksh main tha athwa iske prasar ke viruddh
 The importance of Russia's revolution lies not only in the history of Europe, but in the history of the world

 Due to work in it, millions of workers abandoned the countryside and villages and started living in the cities and cities in which factories were established yesterday

 By becoming familiar with their political rights, the people of Russia understood that a completely democratic regime should be established in Russia, where the rule of power is in the hands of ordinary people

 Books written in western Europe were translated into Russian

 The government ordered the army to shoot at them to disperse the robbers by firing them, but the soldiers refused to shoot because they had sympathy with the public
 unamem bhi kranti kii bhaavana pravesh kar chuki thi
 When the workers saw that the soldiers were not ready to shoot at them, their courage increased

 The Duma, on the other hand, refused to be immersed

 or pesh hai nohe kii kuch panktiyaan jo muharram ke maheene main padhi or padhai jaati hai Autism is a disorder occurring during brain development that affects a person's social behavior and interaction
 hindi main ise 'aatmavimoh' or 'svaparayanata' bhi kehete hai
 The affected person behaves in a limited and repetitive manner, such as repeating the same task over and over
 yah sab bachche ke teen saal hone se pehle hi shuru ho jaataa he
 a set of these symptoms differentiates narcissism from mild narcotic spectrum disorder, such as Asperger's syndrome
 otism ek maansik rog he jiske lakshan janm se hi yaa baalyavastha se nazar aane lagaten hai
 The development of children who have this disease is unusual compared to other children
 otism hone ke koi ek kaaran nahin khoja ja sakaa he
 According to the recommendations, there can be many reasons for autism such as- aatmavimoh kaa ek majboot anuvanshik aadhaar hota he, haalanki aatmavimoh kii anuvanshiki jatil he or yah spasht nahin he ki ASD kaa kaaran bahujine samvaad he yaa durlabh utparivartan 
 In rare cases, narcissism has also been linked to factors that are responsible for birth defects
 anya prastaavit kaarnon me, bachapan ke tike, vivaadaaspad hai or iske koi vaigyanik saboot bhi nahin he
 According to a recent review, two cases per 1000 people are self-reported, while the number is close to 6 / 1000 for ASD
 ausatan ASD kaa purush:mahila anupaat 4,3:1 he
 Cases of narcissism have increased dramatically since 1980, one of the reasons being the growth in the field of medical diagnosis, but whether these cases have actually increased is an unanswered question
 aatmavimoh mastishk ke kai bhaagon ko prabhavit karata he, par iske kaarnon ko dhang se nahin samajha jaataa
 Parents usually recognize its symptoms in the first two years of their child's life
 shuruaati sangyanatmak yaa vyavhaari hastkshep, bacchon ko swayan kii dekhbhaal, saamaajik or baatcheet kaushal ke vikaas main sahaayta kar sakate hai
 There is no cure for it
 bahut kam aatistic bachche hi vayask hone par aatmanirbhar hone main safal ho pate hai
 Nowadays, a self-imposed culture has developed, in which some people believe in treatment and for some people self-immolation is a condition rather than a disorder
 aatmavimoh ko ek lakshan ke bajaay ek vishisht lakshanon ke samooh dwaara behatar samajha ja saktaa he
 Key symptoms include inability to social interaction, inability to communicate, limited hobbies, and repetitive behavior
 anya pahaluon me, jaise khaane kaa ajeeb tarika haalaanki aam he lekin nidaan ke liye aavashyak nahin he
 Social development In addition to being incapable of self-immolation, humans are unable to understand the intentions of other people, so people often do not take them seriously
 saamaajik asamarthataayen bachapan se shuru ho kar vyask hone tak chalati hai
 Autistic children tend to be indifferent to social activities, do not look at people, do not smile, and most commonly do not react: even when they are called
 otistic shishuon kaa vyavhaar to or chaunkaane vaala hota he, wo aankh nahin milaate hai or apni baat kehane ke liye wo aksar duusare vyakti kaa haath choote or hilaate hai
 Children between three and five years of age usually do not display social understanding, do not respond at all to calls, are insensitive to feelings, silent behaviorists and turn to others
 iske baavjood wo apni praathmik dekhbhaal karne vaale vyakti se jude hote he
 Children with narcissism exhibit less attuned protection than normal children, although this symptom disappears in children with high brain development or who have low ASD
 ASD se grasit bade bachche or vyask chehron or bhaawanaaon ko pahchaanane ke pareekshan main bahut bura pradarshan karte hai
 Contrary to popular belief, autistic children do not like to be alone
 dost bananaa or dosti banaae rakhana aatistic bachche ke liye aksar mushkil sabit hota he
 For them, the quality of friendship matters not the number of friends
 ASD se peedit logon ke gusse or hinsa ke bare main kaaphi kisse hai lekin vaigyanik adhyayan bahut kam hai
 These limited statistics show that only children with narcissism are aggressive or aggressive
 dominic at al, ne 67 ASD se grast bacchon ke mata-pita kaa saakshaatkaar liya or nishkarsh nikaala ki, do tihaai bacchon ke jivan main aanse daur aate hai jab unka vyavhaar bahut bura ho jaataa he jabaki ek tihaai bachche aakraamak ho jate hai, aksar bhashaa ko thik se na jaanane vaale bachche nakhrel hote hai
 There are some major differences between normal children and autistic children in childhood, on the basis of which this condition can be identified as- ek tihaai se lekar aadhe otistik vyaktiyon main apane dainik jivan kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke laayak bhashaa bodh tathaa bolne kii kshamta viksit nahin ho paati
 Shortcomings in communication are visible in the first year of life, including late speaking, unusual gestures, sluggish response, and a lack of cohesion in conversations with your foster
 duusare or tisare saal main, otistic bachche kam bolte hai, saath hi unka shabd sanchay or shabd sangyojan bhi vistrut nahin hota
 Their expressions often do not match their spoken words
 aatistic bacchon main anurodh karne yaa anubhavon ko baantne kii sambhaavna kam hoti he or unamem bas dusron kii baaten ko dohraane kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he 
 Functional communication requires joint attention, and this combined attention deficit distinguishes ASD infants from others: Example: Instead of the object they are pointing at, they might see the hand they are pointing to
 And they are failing to do so continuously
 otistic bacchon ko kalpanasheel khelon main or bhashaa seekhney main kathinaayee ho sakati he
 No particular repetition is related to narcissism, but narcissism is responsible for these behaviors
 otism ko sheeghra pahchaanana or manorog visheshgy se turant paraamarsh hi iskaa sabase pehla ilaaj he
 Contact a psychiatrist, psychologist, or trained special educator if symptoms of autism appear
 otism ek aaajeevan rahane vaali avasthaa he jiske purna upachaar ke liye koi dawa kii khoj zaari he, atah iske ilaaj ke liye yahan-vahaan na bhataken va bina samay gavaayen iske bare main jaankaree praapt karen
 Autism is a type of developmental disease that cannot be cured completely, but the patient can be taught a lot through proper training and counseling, which helps him to take care of himself in his daily life
 otism se grasit 70% vayaktiyon main maansik mandatha paayi jaati he jiske kaaran vah ek saamaanya jivan jeene main puri tarah se samarth nahin ho pate, parantu yadi maansik mandatha bahut aghik na ho to otism se grasit vyakti bahut kuch sikh paata he
 Sometimes some such abilities are also seen in these children which are far from the understanding and reach of normal people

 The Pirates of the Seas is a series of thrilling films directed by Gore Verbinski, written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rozio and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer
 ve usee naam ke ek walt dijani theme park sawari par aadhaarit hai or captain jaik spairo, vil turnar or elizabeth swaan kaa anusaran karte hai
 The films debuted on the big screen in 2003 with their first release of Samudar's Robbers: The Curse of the Black Pearl
 Following the unexpected success of the first film, Walt Disney Pictures reported that a composition triad was in the works
 samundar ke lutere: murde kaa khazaana teen saal baad 2006 main jari kii gai
 Its answer story proved to be very successful, breaking records worldwide on the day of its premiere
 In the end it grossed a total of $ 1,066,179,725 at the worldwide box office, becoming the fourth and fastest film to reach this amount
 The third film of the series, Samundar Ke Lootere: Last Watch was released in 2007

 Disney asked Jay Wolpert to write a ride-based script, which producer Jerry Bruckheimer rejected, thinking it was "an accurate pirate film"
 Because of the information about their piracy, Stuart Biatti was brought in to rewrite the script in March 2002, and Elliot and Rozio later that same month
 iliyat va rozio pyrets of da carabian theme park sawari ke shuruuaati varnan se prerit ho gaye or unhone film ko ek alokik sira dene kaa nirnay kar liya
 As the budget went up, Michael Eisner and Robert Iger threatened to cancel the film, though Bruchheimer changed his mind by showing concept art and animation

 Verbinski was attracted to the idea of using modern technology, which was being used to revive the style that had disappeared after the Hollywood golden era, and he remembered his childhood memories of riding, he felt That the film was an occasion to pay tribute to its "scary and funny" tone
