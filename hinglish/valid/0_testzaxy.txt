 shaanti mantra vedon ke ve mantra hai jo shaanti kii prarthana karte hai
 Often they are recited at the beginning and end of the Hindu religious acts
 Shanti Mantras are found in Upanishads, where they are invoked in the beginning of some topics of Upanishads
 They are supposed to calm the mind of reciter and environment around him / her
 Reciting them is also believed to be removing any obstacles for the task being started
 Shanti Mantras always end with three utterances of word "shanti" which means "peace"
 The Reason for uttering three times is for calming and removing obstacles inthree realms which are: "physical" or adhibhautik, "divine" or subordinate and "internal" or aadhyatmik According to the scriptures of Hinduism sources of obstacles and troubles are in these three realms
 Physical or adhi-bhautika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming from external world, such as from wild animals, people, natural calamities etc
 Divine or adhi-daivika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming from extra-sensory world of spirits, ghosts, deities, demigods / angels etc
 Internal or Adhyaatmika realm is source of troubles / obstacles arising out of ones own body and mind, such as pain, diseases, laziness, absent-mindedness etc
 These are called "tapa-traya" or three classes of troubles
 When Shanti mantras are recited, obstacles from these realms are believed to bepacified

 Bhattikavya is an epic poem by Mahakavi Bhatti
 iskaa vaastavik naam 'ravanavadh' he
 In this, the story of Lord Ramchandra is linked from birth to the destruction of Lankeshwar Ravana
 yah mahakavy sanskrit sahitya ke do mahaan paramparaon - ramayana evam panineey vyakaran kaa mishran hone ke naate kala or vigyaan kaa samishran jaisaa he
 Hence, it is considered a new and courageous experiment in literature
 bhatti ne swayan apni rachana kaa gaurav prakat karte hue kaha he ki yah meri rachana vyakaran ke gyaan se hin pathakon ke liye nahin he
 This can be understood only with the help of poetic commentary
 yah medhaavi vidwaan ke manovinod ke liye rachaa gaya he, tathaa subodh chaatr ko praayogic paddati se vyakaran ke duruh niyamon se avgat karaane ke liye
 Bhattikavya's maturity has made him popular and valid despite being difficult
 pracheen pathnpathan kii paripati main bhattikavy ko suprasiddh panchamahakavy ke samaan sthaan diya gaya he
 About 14 commentaries are dedicated to Jayamangala, Mallinath's Sarvapathin and Jeevanand
 madhavidhatuvritti main aadi shankaracharya dwaara bhattikavy par pranit tikaa kaa ullekh miltaa he
 The epic text of this epic is Valmikkrit Ramayana
 mahakavy main chaar kand hai
 From the point of view of the story of the story, this epic is divided into 22 circles and is coordinated with the overall characteristics of the epic
 rachana kaa mukhya uddeshy vyakaran evam sahitya ke lakshanon ko lakshya dwaara upasthit karne kaa he
 This epic is divided into four kandas in order to present the symptoms by the target, in which three kandas serve the purpose of the author by using various word forms according to Sanskrit grammar
 madhya main ek cond kavyasaushthav ke katipay angon ko abhilakshith kar rachaa gaya he
 The sequence of composition is such that the first case grammatically stores a wide variety of word forms
 dwitiya cond 'adhikaar cond' he jisamen panineey vyakaran ke katipay vishisht adhikaron main pradarshit niyamon ke anusaar shabdaprayog he
 The third episode has been designed with a view to reflecting literary characteristics, hence Mahakavi has termed this incident as 'prasad Kand'
 is cond main chaar adhikaran hai : pratham adhikaran main shabdalankar evam arthalankar ke lakshya hai
 In the second tribunal, the nature of the virtue has been demonstrated by the target, the third tribunal highlights the various elements and measures of politics according to the theme of the plot while displaying the nature of emotionality
 prasann cond kaa chauthaa adhikaran is mahakavy kaa ek vishesh rup he
 It contains such verses that have parallel incorporation of Sanskrit and Prakrit language, the same verse is sub-stitched in Sanskrit, whose verse is also the same form of Prakrit verse and both languages have the same prophetic meaning
 bhashaa sam kaa udhaaharan prastut karata hua yah ansh bhattikavy kii nijee visheshta he
 The last episode again demonstrates the varied word form of the trinity, a complex form of Sanskrit grammar
 yah cond sabase bada he
 Symptomatic, in terms of the division of the Kathaavastu in these four scandals, the first five cantos are described in which the undertaking of Ramjanma, Sita Vivaha, Rama's Vanagman and Sitaharan and Rama's seeding are described respectively
 dwitiya cond agle chaar sargo ko vyaapt karata he jisamen sugriv kaa rajbhishek, vanar bhaton dwaara sita kii khoj, laut aane par ashokavatika kaa bhang or maaruti ko pakadakar sabha main upasthit kiye jane kii kathavstu varnit he
 Thirdly, there are the next four cantos in Prasannakand which include the performance of Sita's cognition, the description of Prabhat in Lanka, the story of Vibhishana's arrival with Rama and the story of the bridge
 antim, tisaint cond agle nau sarg le letaa he jinamein sharbandh se lagaakar raja ramchandra ke ayodhya laut aane tak kaa kathabhag varnit he
 There are 1625 verses in four episodes and 22 sergoes, of which the first verse Mangalacharan is objective and the last verse is of poetry
 1625 padyasankhya ke is mahakavy main adhikansh prayog anushtubh shlokon kaa he jinamein sarg chah, nau tathaa 14 vaan evam 12 vaan
 In the tenth canto various verses have been used of which Puppitagra is prominent
 inke atirikt praharshini, malini, aupchchhandsik, vanshastha, vaitaliya, ashvalalit, nandan, prithvi, ruchira, narkutak, tanumadhya, trotak, drutvilambit, pramitakshra, praharnaklika, mandakrantha, shardoolavikreedit evam sragdhara kaa chhutput prayog dikhaai detaa he
 From the point of view of literature, there is mainly ozoguna and gauri ritual in Bhattikavya, however other Madhuryadi qualities and Vaidarbhi and Lahti rituals are also available in sufficient quantity
 swayan praneta ke anusaar bhattikavy kii rachana gurjar desh ke antargat balbhi nagar main hui
 The name of the poet Bhatti is an abrasive form of the word "bhartru"
 katipay sameekshak kavi kaa puraa naam bhartruhari maanate hai, parantu yah bhartruhari nishchit hi shatakatray ke nirmaataa athwa vaakyapadiya ke praneta bhartruhari se bhinn hai
 The Bhatti surname is related to Bhartrihari poet Valbhiranesh Sridhar Sen
 mahakavi bhatti kaa samay isvi chhathi shatabdi kaa uttarardh sarvasammat he
 The examples indicated in the Alankara class show that Bhatti and Bhamah are followers of the same tradition
 bhattikavy kii rachana ke purv lagbhag 10 shatabdiyon tak panini kaa ashtaadhi kaa hi gahan pathan-pathan hota aa rahaa tha
 Bhatti's aim was to create a tool that would make Ashtadhyayi's study easier
 aisa unhone pehle se maujuud vyakaran ke bhashyagranthon main die gayi udaahranon ko ramakatha ke saath sambaddh karke kiya
 This led to simplicity and simplicity in learning
 bhattikavy kaa prabhaav sudur java tak dekhne ko miltaa he
 The Ramayana of ancient Java language is based on Bhattikavya
 yah ramayana java bhashaa kaa vartmaan main bachaa hua sabase pracheen granth he
 It follows Ramayana Bhattikavya completely till the 12th canto
 kabhi-kabhi to puri kii puri kavita kaa anuwaad kar diya gaya he
 After the 12th canto, the Ramayana of the Java language seems to diverge from Bhattikavya

 It features the story of a girl named Alice who falls into a rabbit den, into a fantasy world populated by strange and human-like creatures
 yah kahani, dodson ke mitron ke sanketon se bhari he
 The way this story has introduced the argument has given this story lasting popularity among adults as well as children
 ise "saahitiyik bakawaas" style ke ek sabase achche udhaaharan ke rup main mana jaataa he, or iskaa kathanaatmak path or sanrachana kaaphi prabhaavshaalee rahi he, khaskar fantasy style main
 Ellis was written in 1865, exactly three years after the incident, when Reverend Charles Lutwig Dodgson and Reverend Robinson Duckworth set sail on a boat across the Thames River with three little girls: ve teen ladkiyaan oxford vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati or christ carch ke dean ke saath-saath westminster skool ke headmaster, henry jorge lidele kii betiyaan thi
 Much of the book's adventures are based on and influenced by the people, circumstances and buildings of Oxford and Christ Church, such as the "rabbit Hole" which signifies the actual staircase behind the main hall of Christ Church
 yah mana jaataa he ki ripan cathedral main, jahaan carol ke pita ek canan the, griphon or khargosh kii ek nakkashi ne kahani ke liye prerana pradaan kii
 The journey began on the Fauley Bridge near Oxford and ended five miles away in the village of Godstow
 samay bitaane ke liye reverend dodson ne ladakiyon ko ek kahani sunai, jisamen purna sanyogvash nahin, ek elice naam kii uchaat man kii ladki he jo romaanch kii talash main nikalati he
 The girls liked it and Alice Liddell asked Dodson to write it for her
 After a long delay - over two years - he finally did so and on 26 November 1864 gave Alice a handwritten manuscript of the Alice's Adventures Under Ground, which had Dodgson's own drawings
 kuch logon sahit martin gardenar ko ashanka he ki ek purv-sanskaran bhi tha jise baad main khud dodson ne nasht kar diya, jab unhone haathon se ek adhik vistrut pratilipi mudrit kii, lekin iskaa samarthan karne ke liye pratham drushtya koi gyaat sakshya nahin he
 But even before Ellis got his copy, Dodgson was preparing to expand its publication and the 15,500-word original story to 27,500 words, most notably adding episodes about the Cheshire Cat and the Mad t-party
 Related In 1865, Dodgson's story, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by "lewis Carroll", was published by John Tenniel
 2,000 ke pratham prakaashan ko roak diya gaya kyonki tenial ne print gunvattta par aapatti kii

 Appleton's Ellis binding was almost identical to Macmillan's Ellis of 1866, with the publisher's name just downstream

 The book is commonly referred to by the abbreviated title Alice in Wonderland, an alternate title popularized by numerous adaptations of stage, film, and TV produced over the years
 is sheershak ke kuch mudran main, elises adventures in vanderland or uski agali kadi thru da looking glass, or whot elice found der, donon maujuud hai
 Chapter 1 - Inside the Rabbit's Den: Alice is bored with her sister by the river, when she sees a white rabbit with a clothed watch running away
 vah uske peeche-peeche jate hue ek khargosh kii maand ke andar jaati he jahaan neeche vah vibhinn aakaar ke kai band daravaaje vaale ek ajeeb haul main pahunchati he
 She finds a small key to a door, but the door is too small for her, but through which she sees an attractive garden
 use tab ek bottle milti he jis par likhaa hota he "mujhe piyo", us bottle kii saamagree use bahut chota bana detii he jisase vah us kunjee tak pahunch jaati he
 a cake with "eat Me" on it makes it such a huge size that its head hits the ceiling
 adhyay 2- aansu kaa talab: elice dukhi ho jaati he or roti he jisase uske aansuon se us haul main baadh aa jaati he
 After being made small again by holding a fan in his hand, Alice meets a rat swimming in her tears, a rat also swimming
 vah uske saath thodi si baat karnaa chaahati thi par vah sirf apni billi ke bare main baat kar saki, jisase vah chuha naaraaz ho gaya
 Chapter 3 - Caucus Race and a Long Story: a sea of tears overflows with crowds of other animals and birds
 elice or anya jaanavar, kinare ekatrit hote hai or unke samaksh sawaal yah he ki kaise phir se sookhaa jaae
 chuha unhen wiliam vijeta par ek bahut hi sookhaa vyaakhyaan detaa he
 The dodo decides that the best way to get everyone dry would be a caucus-race, under which everyone would run in a circle with no clear winner
 anjaane main apni billi ke bare main baat karke, elice, antat sabhi jaanwaron ko daraa kar dur kar detii he
 Chapter 4-rabbit sends Little Bill: The White Rabbit reappears to find the Queen's gloves and fan
 vah elice ko ghar ke andar jaakar un chizon ko punah praapt karne kaa aadesh detaa he, lekin ek baar andar jate hi vah badi hone lagati he
 The frightened rabbit orders his gardener, Bill the Lizard, to climb onto the roof and go down the chimney
 Outside, Alice hears the sound of animals that had gathered to see her huge hand
 bheed us par kankad phekati he, jo chote kek ke tukdo main parivartit ho jate hai or jab elice in tukdon ko khaati he to vah apane vaastavik aakaar main aa jaati he
 Chapter 5- Advice from a Caterpillar: Alice arrives at a mushroom and finds a caterpillar sitting there drinking a hookah
 caterpillar elice se sawaal karata he or elice apni kavita yaad na rakh paane kii asamarthta ke saath mishrit apni maujuuda pahchaan sankat ko sweekaarti he
 Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one part of the mushroom will make her taller and the other part will make her shorter
 vah mashroom se do tukade todatii he
 One part of the mushroom makes him even smaller than before, while the other part lengthens his neck and reaches it among the trees, where a pigeon sits mistaking him as a serpent
 kuch prayaas karke, elice khud ko apane vaastavik kad main waapas laati he
 She stumbles upon a small ground and then uses a mushroom to reach a suitable height
 adhyay 6-suar or kaali mirch: ek fish-footman ke paas ghar kii rani ke liye ek nimantran he jo vah ek frog-footman ko detaa he
 Alice watches this exchange carefully and then, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, introduces herself into the house
 rani kaa rasoiyaa bartan fek rahaa he or ek soup bana rahaa he jisame bahut sari kaali mirch padi he or jiske kaaran elice, rani or uskaa baccha bahut buree tarah se cheenk rahen hai
 The queen gave her baby to Alice, and the child was transformed into a pig so that Alice's surprise was not confined
 adhyay 7-e mad tii party: cheshair cat ek ped par prakat hota he or use march hair ke ghar kii ore nirdeshit karata he
 He disappears, but his grin is left floating behind in the air and prompts Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat
 saw
 Alice is a guest at the "mad" Tea Party, with the hater, March Heyer, and a sleeping doormouse who sleeps for most of the chapter
 anya paatro ne elice ko kai paheliyaan or kahaniyaan deen
 The Mad Hatter states that they drink tea throughout the day, as time has permanently stabilized and punished him at 6 in the evening
 elice, paheliyon kii bauchhaar se apamaanit or klaant ho jaati he or vah yah daawa karte hue party se chali jaati he ki yah party uske ab tak ke jivan kii sabase murkhtapurna party thi
 Chapter 8 - Queen's Crockett Ground: Alice leaves the tea party and enters a garden where she is met by three living cards who were coloring white roses in red because the Queen of Hearts hates white 
 taash ke patton, raajaaon or raniyon or yahaan tak ki ek safed khargosh kaa ek julus bageeche main pravesh karata he
 Alice then meets the king and queen
 rani, jise khush karnaa bahut mushkil he, apane takiyakalam "of wyeth hiz head" ko prastut karti he
 Which came out of his mouth due to a little dissatisfaction with a citizen
 elice ko aamantrit kiya gaya rani or uske pyaadon ke saath crocket kaa khel khilne ke liye jo ki jald hi avyavasthit ho jaataa he
 The live flamingos were being used as mugdars and the hedgehogs were made balls and Ellis once again met the Cheshire Cat
 tabhi queen of hearts ne billi kaa sar kalam karne kaa aadesh diya, jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki uske jallaad ne shikaayat kii ki yah asambhav he kyonki us billi kaa keval sar hi dikhataa he
 Since the cat belongs to the queen, the queen agrees to release the queen from captivity to resolve the issue
 adhyay 9-mock taratal kii kahani: elice ke anurodh par rani ko crocket ground par laayaa gaya
 She thinks on finding morality in everything around her
 queen of hearts ne use maut ki sazaa kii dhamkee de kar use vahaan se bhaga diya or elice ko greephone se milwaaya, jo use mock taratal ke paas le gaya
 Mock Turtle is very unhappy without any trouble
 vah yah bataane kii koshish karata he ki kaise vah skool main ek asli taratal hua karata tha, jise greephone bich main hi baadhit kar detaa he taaki ve ek khel khel saken
 Chapter 10-lobster Quadrille Mock Turtle and Gryphon dance to the rhythm of the Lobster Quadril while Ellis recites "'tis the voice of the lobster"
 mock taratal unke liye "beautiphul soup" ga rahaa tha jiske dauraan greephone elice ko ek asann mukademe ke liye khinch kar le jaataa he
 Chapter 11-who Stole Tarts ?: Alice becomes part of a lawsuit where the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing Queen's tarts
 juri main vibhinn jaanavar sammilit hai jiname bill di lizard bhi shaamil he or white rabit nyaayalay kaa turyavadk he or king of hearts nyaayadhish he
 During the proceedings, Alice finds that she is growing very fast
 dormause elice ko tezi se badhane par daantata he or kahata he ki use itani tezi se badhane or sari hawa le lene kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Alice makes fun of the accusations of Dormouse and says that it is ridiculous because everyone grows up and it is not in her hands
 is dauraan gavaahon main shaamil he mad hatter, jo puche gayi sawaalon ke apratyaksh uttar dekar king ko naakhush or hatotsahit kar detaa he or rani kaa cook
 Chapter 12-alice's Evidence: Alice is then called as a witness
 vah galati se jaanwaron se bhari juri box ko gira detii he or king aadesh detaa he ki mukadmaa jari rakhane se pehle sabhi jaanwaron ko unki jagah par waapas rakhaa jaye
 king or queen, niyam 42 kaa hawala dete hue elice ko vahaan se chale jane kaa aadesh dete hai, parantu elice unke is aadesh kaa virodh karti he or jane se inkaar karti he
 She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over these ridiculous actions and at the same time refuses to rein in her tongue
 queen of hearts apana takiyakalam "of wyeth har head" cheekhte hue kahati he
 But Alice is fearless and calls them all as packets of cards
 elice kii bahan elice ke chehre par se cards ke bajaaye kuch pattiyaan hataate hue use chaay ke liye jagaati he
 Alice leaves her sister by the river to imagine all the curious events herself
 haalanki jabravok ko aksar elises adventures in vanderland kaa paatr mana jaataa he, vah vastav main uski agali kadi thru di looking-glass main hi nazar aata he
 However, it has sometimes been included in film versions, commonly known simply as "alice in Forestland" and causing confusion
 queen of hearts ko saamanytah galati se kahani kii agali kadi, thru di looking-glass, kii red queen samaj liya jaataa he, lekin ek rani hone ke alaava usame queen kii koi bhi anya visheshtaayen nahin hai
 The Queen of Hearts is part of the deck of the card hypothesis that is present in the first book, while the Red Queen represents a red piece of chess, since chess is the subject of the sequel
 kai roopantaran main paatro ko mishrit kar dene ke kaaran, bhram kii sthiti paidaa ho gayi he
 Members of the boat crew who first heard Carroll's story appear in one form or another in Chapter 3
 zaahir he, elice lidel khud to usame thim hi, jabaki carol, yaa charles dodson, bhi dodo ke rup main nakal kiye gaye hai
 Carol is known as Dodo because Dodgson stuttered when he spoke, thus if he spoke his last name he would be do-do-dodgson
 dak, canan dakworth ko; lori, laurina lidele ko; or eagllate, edith lidele ko sanderbhit karata he
 Bill the Lizard may be a play named after Benjamin Disraeli
 tenial ke thru da looking-glass ke ek chitra main ek paatr ko chitrit kiya gaya he jise "main in white paper" ke rup main nirdisht kiya gaya he, kaagaj kii ek topi pahane disraeli ke cartoon ke rup main
 sher or unicorn ke chitra bhi tenial ke gladstone or disraeli ke panch chitron se kaaphi samaan hai
 Hatter is highly likely to be related to Theophilus Carter, a furniture seller known in Oxford for his unconventional inventions
 tenial ne jahiraa taur par hatter ko carol ke suzav par carter jaisaa banaaya

 In "'chapter 6"', the disappearance of the Cheshire cat leads Ellis to say his most memorable line: "


 a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing i ever saw in all my life!" In "chapter 7", Hatter gives his famous puzzle without an answer: "why does the raven like a writing table?" Although Carroll's aim was to have no answer for the riddle, in a new role in the 1896 version of "alice", he offers several answers: "because it can produce some notes, though 


 they are too flat
" : And it is never put from the wrong end! "puzzle expert Sam Lloyd offered the following solutions: * Because the note they are noted for, They are not noted for musical notes * Poe wrote on both * They both have an ink-like quill * Bills and Tales are one of their specialties * Because they both stand on their feet, hide their steel and have them Should be discontinued, several other answers are listed "the Annotated Ellis"
 In Frank Bedor's novel "horned Red", a parody of the main villain Queen Red |] Queen of Hearts]) meets Lewis Carroll and declares that the answer to the riddle is "because i say so"
 Carol is afraid to counter him
 "because i say so"
 Carol is afraid to counter him

 For example, in the second chapter, Alice assumes that the mouse must be French and speaks to her the first sentence of the text of her French book: "où est ma chatte?"

 Gradually these colonies were given sovereignty over their administration, and by the Statute of Westminster, 1931 all these states were given full equal status within the Commonwealth
 jo purv upnivesh, british shaasha ko aaj bhi apana shaasha maanate he, un deshon ko rashtramandal prajabhumi yaa rashtramandal pradesh kaha jaataa he
 As the prominent parallel heads of many of these nations, the British academies also find themselves with the title of head of the Commonwealth
 haalanki shaasha ko aam taurapar british shaasha ke naam se hi sambodhit kiya jaataa he, parantu saiddhanthik taur par saare rashtron kaa samprabhu par saamaan adhikaar he, tathaa rashtramandal ke tamaam desh ek-dusre se purnatah swatantra or swytt hai

 Generally, individuals from the UK to whom His / Her Majesty or His / Her Royal Highness is referred to are generally considered members of the royal family

 The sovereign and his immediate family members carry out various official, ceremonial and representational functions of the country

 dante italy ke sarvshereshth kavi maane jate hai jinke sambandh main angrez kavi shelli ne kaha he ki, The poetry of Dante is like that bridge which is built on the current of time and connects the ancient world with the modern world
 dante ne latin bhashaa main naa likhakar saadhaaran bolchaal kii italvi bhashaa main apana mahakavy likhaa maatrubhaasha or lokprachlit bhashaa ko apni mahaan kritiyon se gauravanvit kiya
 This work was similar to Tulsidas's writing of Ramcharitmanas in the language

 Not only satisfied with the excellent poem, he also tells what the best poem depends on
 prem jaise vishyon ko or lokbhashaon ko apni rachanaaon main mahatva pradaan karke unhone greek or latin paramparaon ke viruddh ek krantikari padaanyas kiya
 The best creation can be possible only when harmony with Dante's thought, harmonious language, good expressive style and appropriate content
 is prakaar dante ne sarvshereshth rachana ke liye bhadde or graamy shabdon ko chhodkar lokbhasha se or shishtbhaasha se bhi uttam shabdon kaa chayan kar apane kavy kii rachana kii he
 The Vulgery Elocuo Granth has been widely praised by George Sainsbury
 dante ke baad italy main utana bada mahatvapurn kavy chintak kroche ke purv nahin hua
 Apart from Greek and Latin literature, Aligyari Dante also had a special interest in theology
 raajnneeti main vah naram dal kaa anuyaayi or samarthak tha kintu san 1301 main jab guilfon ke krantikari dal dwaara iske paksh kii paraajay hui, tab daante tathaa uske saathiyon ko deshnikale kaa dand bhogana padaa
 Unfortunately, if he was caught by the Florentine government after this conviction, he was likely to be burned alive
 is samay se mrityu paryant vah ek sthaan se duusare or duusare se tisare ek ek tirthayatri kii yaa kareeb kareeb ek bhikhaari kii tarah baraabar bhatakta rahaa

 In 1316, a public declaration was made by Florence, and on some derogatory terms, she was also allowed to return to Florence

 The names of the two women are closely associated with the life of the teeth

 The first was her puberty beloved whom she saw when she was only nine years old
 simon di bardi ke saath biatris kaa vivaah ho jane tathaa thode hi samay ke bheetar san 1290 main uski mrityu ho jane ke baad bhi daante uske anuraag main duba rahaa
 The second woman, Gemya, was his married wife with whom he was married in 1277
 daante ke nirvasit hone par usne uskaa saath nahin diya
 It is clear that the teeth were not satisfied with his behavior and color, and later started hating him
 daante kii rachanaaon kii suvidha kii drushti se ham teen bhaagon yaa kaalon main baant sakate hai
 In the first part, those works can be kept in which the enthusiasm of youth and its fervent affection for Biatris is reflected in religious conversion
 isaki avadhi mote taur par 1283 se 1290 tak maani ja sakati he
 The most important composition of this period is Vita Nuova
 doosraa bhaag viatris kii mrityu ke baad shuru hota he
 It can be expanded from 1291 to 1313
 is kaal main uskaa jivan niraashaa, du:kha evam vishwaas par asthaayee rup se tarkbuddhi kaa praadhanya chaa gaya or uskaa jhukaav darshan tathaa vigyaan kii or adhik ho gaya
 He continued to indulge in a tussle or schemes in the acrimony of political quarrels
 is kaal kii mukhya rachanaayen hai - di konvivio, di moderkiya, di ipicills aadi
 From King Henry VII, Dante had set great hopes on which his death was destroyed
 uski samast yojanaayen ekaek samaapt ho gai kintu ganimat yahi rahi ki ve uskaa sampurna hausala post na kar sakin
 He once again moved towards spiritual balance
 yuvavastha ke vichaar or vishwaas usamen pun: jaag uthe or vah divangat biatris kii pavitribhoot aatma kii upasna kii ore or bhi dridhtaa se unmukh ho uthaa
 In many poems of 'divine Comedy', its evidence is scattered
 daante kii rachanaaon kaa yah teesraa kaal 1314 se 1321 tak, yane uski mrityu ke samay tak, mana ja saktaa he
 We can call 'the Vita Nuova' as Italy's first erotica
 isamen kavihruday kii ukt bhaawanaaon ke manovaigyanik vishleshan kii jhalak hamen dekh padati he
 How her new life started only after the first darshan of Biotris, how the woman's sense of beauty and beauty continued to get stronger in her heart, how she slowly got her hopes and love and devotion
 It became a center, at the same death, how much mental anguish and ecstasy he suffered and how his earthly love finally culminated in divine devotion and worship
 This can be seen in poetry
 biatris kii mrityu ke baad uskaa dhyaan kuch varshon ke liye ihlokik bhaawanaaon, vichaaron tathaa swaarthon kii ore gaya or vah niraashaaon athwa sanshayon ke bich hilore khaane laga
 We can see this in his second work 'conbaivs'
 in donon rachanaaon main biatris kahan or kab ek alokik saundarya kii pratimaa prathit hoti he or kahan vah maatr ek darshanik athwa dharmik drushti se kalpit divya chaaya si dekh padati he, iskaa vivechan karnaa anaavashyak he
 Suffice it to say that 'vita Nuova' is a mental elevation of the poet towards a higher sattvikta and reverence rather than an ordinary love story
 isamen andeh nahin ki aashaa niraashaaon ke vividh antardvandvon ke baavjood daante kaa hriday baar baar isi ore prayavarti hone ke liye sachesht hota jaan padataa he
 In fact, it is only from the last part of the poetry that one begins to cast a shadow on the poet's psyche, the focal world, whose center was Biatrice, and which mattered in his poetic poem called 'divine Comedy'
 daante kii laathini rachanaaon main 'de monarkia' vishesh ullekhneey he
 It shows that the need of the empire is in a way supported by God
 unamem rajya tathaa carch yaa dharmik sanstha ke pruthak pruthak kshetra kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he or is baat par bal diya gaya he ki pope kii satta keval dharmik maamalon tak hi simit rahani chahie
 Thoughts of this intention have been expressed in many of the letters to him in the collection of Ephesians
 daante ke paksh vipaksh main kaaphi aalochanaayen hui jinke uski kirti kabhi kabhi malin ho jaati si dikhaai padati thi
 Yet there is no doubt that he was a great poet who influenced many of his later poets and litterateurs
 samay bitne par anek vidwaanon or vichaarkon ne uski bhuri bhuri prashansa kii he jisase aaj vishwa ke sahityakaron tathaa kaviyon main use yathesht unchaa sthaan dene main sahaayta milti he

 This class discrimination helps in the development of untouchability
