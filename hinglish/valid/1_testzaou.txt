 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 paristhitiyon ke anukool na hone par andey kaa sansechan nahin hota
 The following circumstances are necessary for impregnation: ant: sansechan karanevaale praaniyon main andon kii sankhya bahut kam hoti he or ek baar main ek yaa kuch hi santan utpann hoti he, par jin praaniyon main bahya sansechan hota he, dimb kii sankhya atyadhik hoti he or andon kii apeksha shukranuon kii sankhya to or bhi adhik
 When eggs and sperm are mixed in water, there are many barriers to the zygotes, such as the temperature of the water, its acidity or alkalinity; Speed of water current, presence of other nearby aquatic creatures etc
 at: spishij kii shrinkhalaa banaae rakhane ke liye prakruti dimb or shukranuon kaa utpaadan adhik sankhya main karti he, kyonki in bahusankhyak andon ore shukranuon main se anek andey or shukranu uparyukt kaarnon main se koi bhi pratikul kaaran hene par asansechit avasthaa main mar jate hai
 a egg requires only one sperm for impregnation
 manushya ke ek baar ke maithun main skhlit veery main saamanyat: shukranuon kii sankhya 22,60,00,000 anumaanit kii gai he
 Of these, only one works to store the sperm egg
 prayek dimpotsurg main keval ek hi dimb dimbugranthi se nikalataa he
 As soon as a functioning sperm comes in contact with the egg of its own species, it enters it
 shukranu kaa sir to dimb ke andar ghus jaataa he, kintu uski punch tuutakar baahar hi rah jaati he
 Venus enters the egg and incites many events inside it
 sabase pehle vah dimb main kisi anya shukranu ke pravesh ko roktaa he
 This is how it works: sansechit andey ke bahya str se ek prakaar kaa rasinic srav nikalataa he, jo anya shukranu ko dimb kii ore aakarshith na kar vikarshith karata he athwa dimb ke baahar chaaron ore ek prakaar kii jelly jaisi jhilli ban jaati he, jisase shukranu kaa pravesh nahin ho paata athwa abhedya bhitti se ghira dimb kaa bilkul chota chhed, microple ek shukranu ke pravesh karte hi band ho jaataa he
 Upon insertion into the egg, the sperm meets the centroid of the egg, moving from the stipulated path to the nucleus, and both the sperm and the embryo merge to form chromosomes, which remain independent of the cytoplasm
 dimb ab yugmaj ban jaataa he
 The centrosonome of the egg disappears, but the centrosome of the sperm divides into two, forming a dynamic locus
 is tarku ke ayanvrutt ke chaaron ore chromosamem apni apni jagah le lete hai or sansechit dimbkosh kaa vibhaajan or vikaas shuru hokar bhrun kaa nirmaan hone lagata he
 Considering how the mass of the masses is known, it is found that in most cases, by accident, the male population is accidentally exposed to the floating female mass, but in some conditions the sperm move directly towards the specified target
 iskaa kaaran shukranu kaa kisi vishesh rasinic dravya kii ore aakarshith hona he
 This chemical substance produces egg
 ise rasinic karshan kehete hai
 But there is no chemical traction in every situation
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki nar janyu or maadaa janyu main dhruviya antar hota he, jisase ve paraspar aakarshith hote hai
 What is the real cause of attraction, it cannot be said for sure
 sambhog ke samay maadaa praaia: niskriy rahati he or nar main maadaa ke aalingan ke liye vividh bhanti ke aalingan avyav viksit hote hai
 Some creatures have minor figurative features, such as a beard, a mustache in a human male, and a lack of them in the female but developed breasts and a variety of different colors in sparrows, etc
 yah gaun lakshan gyanendriyon ko prabhavit kar nar tathaa maadaa kaa sanyog karaane main sahaayak hote hai
 Some animals also have some auxiliary components, which are meant to protect the offspring
 anek praaniyon main sansechan ke pashchaat maan-baap kii jimmedaariyaan samaapt ho jaati hai or yugmaj bina kisi dekharekh ke viksit hote hai, kuch praaniyon main bachche apana laalan paalan swayan karte hai, par kuch praaniyon main maan baap apni santan kii raksha kaa bada dhyaan rakhte hai
 They choose a suitable place to protect eggs or embryos
 kuch unako band rakhane kaa upaay bhi karte hai
 For this they manufacture coa
 anya jantuon main andnikshepak hote hai, jinamein ve andey surakshit rakhte hai athwa kisi jivit yaa mrit praani ke utak se ve yahi kaam lete hai
 At the same time, eggs develop and ovules are formed
 kuch praaniyon ke andey yaa dimbh maan yaa baap se chipke rahete hai
 Some parents take them in gills, some in baby bags, such as in crustaceans, some in nectaries, some in dilated ovaries and some in marsupial bags
 kuch praaniyon main dimb or shukranu kaa sanyog mata ke sharir ke andar hi hota he or yugmaj kaa khandikaran evam bhrun kaa vikaas bhi vahiin hota he
 Once the fetus is fully developed, the baby comes out of the mother's womb by delivery
 jitne dinon tak bhrun mata ke garbh main rahata he, utane samay ko garbhakaal kehete hai
 This type of development is called internal development
 kuch machhliyon, chhipakaliyon or pakshiyon main dimb kaa sansechan maithun dwaara maadaa ke sharir ke andar hi hota he or yugmaj athav sansechit dimb churnamay aavaran se mandit hokar sharir ke baahar nikalataa he
 Embryo development takes place outside
 purna viksit ho jane par baccha andey kii kholi ko todakar andey se baahar chalaa aata he
 This type of development is called external development
 machhliyon, medhakon tathaa nimna koti ke anya praaniyon main dimb or shukranu donon hi sharir ke baahar skhlit kiye jate hai or vahiin unka sanyog hota he tathaa andey baahar hi bhrun main viksit hote hai
 In this way, impregnation and development are also external
 gaay, bhens, bakrii, manushya ityadi, jinamein bhrun mata ke sharir ke bheetar parivardhit hota he or shishu jivit avasthaa main baahar nikalataa he, jarayuj kehalaate hai
 Unlike them, fish like frog, snake, lizard and bird, in which babies grow out of eggs, are called eggs
 adhikansh dashaon main bhrun kaa poshan maan ke rakt se, aparaa sadrush kisi sanyojak dwaara hota he
 a similar arrangement is found in some shark fishes, anablabs, some lizards and mammals
 kuch praaniyon main janm ke pashchaat athwa andey se baahar aane par navjaat shishu ko maan-baap bhojan khilaate hai
 Mammals have breasts, from which milk is secreted, this milk is a newborn's diet
 bahuteri chidiyon ke mukh se laar kaa srav hota he, jo chuujon kaa bhojan hota he
 Otherwise the birds swallow the food and put it in the baby's mouth
 sadharantaya vayask honaper janan prarambh hota he, par kuch praaniyon main jaise mizes or akzolatal main shishav avasthaa main hi janan prarambh ho jaataa he
 This is called asechan generation
 adhikansh praaniyon yaa paudhon kii jananritu, praaia: nishchit hoti he, dimb kaa vikaas ritu or vaataavaran par nirbhar karata he
 Many birds, insects and other animals have high reproductive activity in spring or summer season
 vaataavaran kii sthiti, taap, ardrata, shushkta ityadi sharirkriya ko prabhavit karti hai or inkaa prabhaav janan par bhi padataa he
 Reproduction is closely related to food
 jahaan vaataavaran ek sa rahata he, vahaan ke praaniyon main ritukal nishchit nahin hota, jaise philipine dwipon main jalwaayu kii paristhitiyon se hi kuch praaniyon kaa pravasan hota he or sahaayak jananendriyon main samayik, bahya yaa ant:parivartan hote hai
 In some animals, reproduction goes on throughout life, but in some, with the increase of age, the reproductive function becomes slow or stops altogether
 adhikansh praaniyon main janankriyasheeltaa ke bad vishram kaal aata he or uske baad phir ritukal aarambh hota he
 This sequence happens in series or alternately
 ucch koti ke praaniyon main, jinamein manushya bhi aata he, garam hona, raj:srav athwa andanu utpaadan bhi krambaddh hote hai
 There are some glands in the body of animals, which have no duct
 in grathiyon se hormone banate hai, jo sidhe rakt main chale jate hai
 These circulate throughout the body along with the bloodstream and produce different effects on the body
 ye kuch angon ko uddipt karte or kuch kaa daman karte hai
 Among them, the pituitary gland and the gonad have a very dense relationship with reproduction
 kuch praaniyon main nar jananendriya or nari jananendrit donon hoti hai tathaa shukranu or andey ek hi praani main utpann hote hai
 They are bisexual beings
 inamen yaa to ek hi prakaar ke chromosome andar hi paraspar milakar janan karte hai, jise swayansesechan kehete hai, athwa do ubhayalingi jode khaakar paraspar ek duusare ke andey kaa sansechan karte hai, jise swayansansechan kehete hai, athwa do ubhayalingi jode khaakar paraspar ek duusare ke andey kaa sansechan karte hai, jise 'cross' kehete hai
 Ketchus, leeches, snails and hydra are examples of the previous type
 swayansansechan birla hi paaya jaataa he
 It does not have to be a combination of eggs and Venus
 ise akshatyounik janan bhi kehete hai
 Examples of this are bees and aphids
 madhumakhiyaan kuch sansechit or kuch asansechit yaa agarbhit andey detii hai
 Workless and queen bees are produced from uncultivated eggs, and drones or male bees are produced from uncultivated eggs
 kuch saamudrik praaniyon, jaise si archin main bhi asansechit andey se nae praani kaa utpaadan vaigyanikon ne sambhav kiya he
 Bangchi has been produced by adopting a frog's egg with a needle and developing it
 is prakaar bhautik or rasinic vidhiyon se bhi andey ko viksit hone ke liy safaltaapurvak prerit kiya gaya he
 The liver worm and the tiger salamander have an unusual pattern of reproduction, called ovulation
 isamen jab praani dimbhavstha main hi rahete hai or purna vayask nahin hue rahete tabhi janan karne lagate hai or santanvruddhi karte hai

 weldon vidyut pradaay yaa 'welding power splai' vah yukti he jo welding karne ke liye vidyut dhara pradaan karti he
 Weldon often requires a high current
 spot welding main 12,000 ampear tak dhara aavashyak ho sakati he
 Welding is also done at low currents
 jaise, do rager bladon ko paraspar veld karne ke liye 5 ampir vaali tungston arq welding
 Weldon strength supply can be very simple or very complex
 welding power supplai kaa vargeekaran is aadhaar par karte hai ki ve niyat-dhara pradaan karatin hai yaa niyat voltata
 The output current of such a power supply is fixed, even if the distance between the electrodes is kept low or high
 arthath electrodon ke bich kii duuri kam yaa adhik karne par power supplai swayan output voltata ko is prakaar badal detii he ki output dhara niyat bani rahe 
 Shielded metal arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding use fixed current supply
 gas metal arq welding tathaa flks-kor arq welding main praayah niyat-voltata vaali vidyut pradaay prayukt hoti he
 Here a fixed-voltage weldon power supply is needed because the welder cannot control the arc length so fast
 kintu yadi niyat-voltata vaali welding power supplai kaa upyog shilded metal arq welding ke liye karen to haath hilne se arq kii lambaai main thodaa parivartan hone par bhi welding curent main bahut adhik parivartan kar detaa he jisase welding kii gunvattta kharaab hoti he
 Therefore, fixed current welding power supply should be used there

 In psychology, any 'change' apprehended by the senses is called stimulation
 do yaa do se adhik padon ke sarthak samooh ko, jiskaa puraa puraa arth nikalataa he, use vaakya kehete hai
 For example, 'truth prevails
 ' ek vaakya he kyonki iskaa puraa puraa arth nikalataa he kintu 'satya vijay hoti
 The sentence is not because it does not make sense
 aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti yaa sannidhi honi chahie
 The meaning of 'aspiration' is that words should not be kept simply, they together make sense of one of the elements
 jaise, koi kahe—'manushya charpai pustak' to yah vaakya na hoga
 When he says - 'man reads the book on the bed
 ' tab vaakya hoga
 'ability' means that the meaning emanating from a group of terms is not inconsistent or impossible
 jaise, koi kahe—'pani main haath jal gaya' to yah vaakya na hoga
 'asakti' or 'sannidhi' means proximity or nearness
 arthath taatparybodh karaanevaale padon ke bich desh yaa kaal kaa vyavdhaan na ho
 For example, if no one says 'dog killed, drank water', says - 'dog drank, hit water', then there will be no sentence due to lack of attachment in it; Because the word ‘piya’ is interposed between ‘kuta’ and ‘mara’
 isi prakaar yadi kaai 'pani' sabere kahe or 'piya' shaam ko kahe, to isamen kaal sambandhi vyavdhaan hoga
 The subject of poetic distinction begins primarily with a discussion of Nyaya Darshan and falls under epistemology and jurisprudence

 Cultural grammars in this background have led to the emergence of syntax
 vaakyapadoyakaar dwaara sphotatmak vaakya kii akhand satta sweekrut he
 In the view of philologists, sentences are syntactic and analytical
 shabdakritimulak vaakya ke shabdabhedanusaar chaar bhed hai—samasapradhan, vyasapradhan, pratyaypradhan or vibhaktipradhan
 On the basis of these, languages have also been classified by scholars
 aadhunik vyakaran kii drushti se vaakya ke teen bhed hote hai—saral vaakya
 mishrit vaakya or sanyukt vaakya
 Such a group of words makes sense but does not make complete sense, the phrase says
 udhaaharan - Sentence has two distinctions - jiske bare main baat kii jaay use uddeshy kehete hai or jo baat kii jaay use vidhey kehete hai
 For example, 'mohan lives in Prayag'
 isamen uddeshy he - 'mohan', or vidhey he - 'prayag main rahata he
 'by abhay kumar vaakya bhed do prakaar se kiye ja sakate han- There are eight types of sentences on the basis of meaning - 1 - Legislative sentences, 2 - Prohibitive sentences, 3 - Interrogative sentences, 4 - Exclamatory sentences, 5- Objectionable sentences, 6- Desirable sentences, 7 - Indicative sentences, 8 - Doubtful Sentence
