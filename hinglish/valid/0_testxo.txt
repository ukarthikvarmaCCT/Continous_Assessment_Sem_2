 For any commercial or public beneficial activity, production of essential resources ie materials, machines and humans is of paramount importance as materials and machines cannot create a product in itself but other resources are meaningless without contributing human resources
 Let's go

 In short, it can be said that no organization, whether its mission is to earn profit or to conduct an activity of public interest, cannot succeed in its mission without assimilating efficient human resource management

 He could not kill Harry with his current wand because the axes of his and Harry's wand were the same, so after Lucius Melfoy failed to kill Harry with a stick, he would search for the world's most powerful stick Elder wand

 pehle usne tom ko prem kadha dekar use apane prem main vasheebhoot kiya parantu jab vah garbhvatee hui to usne kadha dena band kar diya
 She stopped brewing with this hope because she did not want to live her untrue life any longer and she also wanted her husband Tom to love her genuinely, as well as hope that her husband at least Will stop being in love with your unborn child
 lekin aisa nahin hota he or tom sachai pataa lagate hi use chhod kar chalaa jaataa he
 Frustrated with all these developments, Meropi starts wandering the streets of London
 ab uske paas keval khandaani sone kaa lacket bachaa tha, jo ki uske purvaj salaajaar slidarin kaa tha, usne kam keemat main bech diya

 After living with her for 12 years, Islot stole Garmlath's wand and she fled to the American colony and moved to Massachusetts
 vahaan par usne ilvermorni jaadu tona or tantra mantra vidhyalay main daakhila le liya
 When Gormlath finds out this, she follows her niece to Massachusetts where she is murdered by Islot's friend

 After Rolling regained his body in the fourth edition of the novel, Voldemort was left with pale skin, a white face like a chalice, a snake-like nasal cavity, a red-eyed and cat-like gullible, skeleton-like body, and unnaturally long fingers
 He is shown with big and thin hands
 upanyaas ke saatven sanskaran ke pehle adhyay ke anusaar uske paas bal tathaa hont bhi nahin the
 According to the stories seen by Smriti Patra in the past in the second and sixth editions, he was beautiful and tall with pale skin, jet black hair and dark brown eyes
 vah apane luk se sabhi ko aakarshith kar saktaa tha
 It is speculated that the reason for his becoming a human being was to divide his soul into a Horcrux in his desire to become immortal
 film main voldemort kii aankhe neeli tathaa pupil golakaar he
 Rolling describes Voldemort as "the worst wizard of hundreds of years"
 unhone use "atyadhik manorogi, anya logon kii pidaa par manushyik pratikriya kaa abhavi" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 At the same time, he has been shown to be the slayer of others, especially the Maghuls, because of his happiness
 uske andar chetana kaa abhaav tha, vah apane kiye par use koi pachhtaawaa nahin hota tha tathaa vah apane atirikt insaaniyat kaa mahatva bhi nahin samajhataa tha
 He neither liked to establish companionship or friendship with man nor did he have any love or affection for anyone
 vah swayan ko shreshth samajhataa tha or apane saamne sabhi ko hin maanata tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was "a truly starving, racist of incredible strength"
 agar vah khwaish darpan main dekhtaa to vah swayan ko "sarvashaktimaan or avinashi" ke rup main dekhtaa jaisaa vah chahta tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was born as a result of a love decoction by his mother and sorceress Meropi Gaunt on a Magaloo and his father Tom Riddle, a result of a failed love
 kaadhe kaa asar khatm hone va pita ke uski maan ko chhod dene ke kaaran uski maan kii mrityu ho jaati he, lekin agar uski maan jivit rahati or use pyaar detii to avashya sab kuch badal gaya hota
 The attraction that led to the transformation of the boy born as Tom Riddle to Voldemort is very necessary because it shows the concept that led to this character
 lagbhag sabhi khalnaayakon ke samaan, voldemort kaa dambh hi uske patan kaa kaaran banataa he
 He was extremely afraid of death, which he described as a shameful and disgusting human weakness
 uske andar ahamkaari hone ke kai lakshan the
 Voldemort confesses to his soul-bearers that he has paid the great price for the attack on Harry's parents, and then observes what went wrong, and ultimately takes the blame for himself
 rolling ne yah likhaa he ki uskaa bahurupia uski antim yatra hoti
 Rolling states the difference between Voldemort and Harry, stating that Harry had accepted death, for this reason he eventually emerged stronger than he was
 puri shrunkhlaa main rolling ne voldemort ko atyadhik shaktishaalee, budhimaan or nirmam dusht jaadugar bataaya he
 He could read others' minds well and also prevent others from entering his own mind
 dambaldor ke atirikt vah ek maatr aisa gyaat jaadugar tha jo chup chaap chhu-mantar ho jaataa tha
 Voldemort feared Dumbledore, the only magician
 antim pustak main voldemort ko bina kisi sahare ke udata dikhaaya gaya, jisane bhi yah padhaa yaa dekha vah achambhit rah gaya
 Like his ancestors, he could also talk to snakes in snake language
 use yah kaushal apane purvaj salaajaar slidarin se mila
 The Gaunt family also used this language in their own conversation
 yah asaadhaaran lakshan usame sambhavtah anuvanshik rup se aa gaya ho, kyonki gont parivaar main yah parampara rakt kii shuddhta banaaye rakhane ke liye nibhaai jaati thi
 When Voldemort attempts to assassinate the newborn Harry, Harry's art of speaking in snake language along with part of his soul also goes away
 jab vah aatma kaa hissaa harry main mar jaataa he to harry main yah shakti khatm ho jaati he
 While watching the old story in the sixth part, Voldemort claimed during a job interview in front of Dumbledore that he had "raised the limits of magic more than ever"
 dambldor ne yah bhi kaha he ki voldemort kii jaadui gyaan kisi bhi jivit jaadugar se bahut adhik he or yahan tak ki voldemort ke puri shakti ke saath lautne par uske mantron ke saamne dambldor ke paas sabase taqatvar bachaav mantra hone kaa gyaan bhi aparyaapt hoga
 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort is probably the smartest student of Hogwarts

 Later, during the Dawood era, the influence of Persian was somewhat reduced

 Later, due to political conditions, the influence of Persian on the Urdu ghazals started increasing again

 Bal Gangadhar Tilak, born Keshav Gangadhar Tilak, was an Indian nationalist, teacher, social reformer, lawyer and a freedom fighter
 ye bhartiya swatantrata sangram ke pehle lokapriy netaa huen; british aupniveshik praadhikari unhen "bhartiya ashaanti ke pita" kehete the
 He also received the venerable title of "lokmanya", which means accepted by the people
 inhen hindu rashtrawaad kaa pita bhi kaha jaataa he
 Tilak was one of the first and strongest advocates of Swaraj during the British Raj, and an ardent radical in Indian conscience
 unka marathi bhashaa main diya gaya naaraa "swarajya ha maajha janmasiddh hakk aahe ani to me milvanara" bahut prasiddh hua
 He formed a close treaty with several leaders of the Indian National Congress, including Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Arvind Ghosh, VO Chidambaram Pillai and Muhammad Ali Jinnah
 tilak kaa janm 23 july 1856 ko british bharat main vartmaan maharashtra sthit ratnagiri jile ke ek gaanv chikhali main hua tha
 These were the first Indian generation to receive modern college education
 inhone kuch samay tak skool or kalejon main ganit padhaayaa
 He was a critical critic of English education and believed that it taught disrespect to Indian civilization
 inhone dakkan shiksha sosayadi kii sthapana kii taaki bharat main shiksha kaa str sudhare
 Tilak started two daily newspapers called English Memratha Darpan and Kesari in Marathi which became very popular among the public
 tilak ne angreji shashan kii krurta or bhartiya samskruti ke prati hin bhaavana kii bahut aalochana kii
 He demanded that the British government immediately give full swaraj to the Indians
 kesari main chhapane vaale unke lekhon kii vajah se unhen kai baar jail bheja gaya
 Tilak joined the Indian National Congress but soon began to speak against the moderate attitude of the Congress
 1907 main congress garam dal or naram dal main vibhajit ho gayi
 The hot party included Lala Lajpat Rai and Bipin Chandra Pal with Tilak
 in teenon ko laal-bal-paal ke naam se janaa jane laga
 In 1908, Tilak supported the bombing of revolutionary Prafulla Chaki and Khudiram Bose, which led to his being sent to Mandalay prison in Burma
 jail se chhootakar ve phir congress main shaamil ho gayi or 1916 main ani besent or mohammad ali jinna ke saath akhil bhartiya home rule lig kii sthapana kii
 Tilak joined the Indian National Congress in 1890
 haalanki, uski madhya abhivritti, khaskar jo swarajya hetu ladaai ke prati thi, ve uske kilaaf the
 He was one of the most eminent radical changeists of his time
 jaldi shaadi karne ke vyaktigat rup se virdohi hone ke baavjood, tilak 1891 age of concent vidheyak ke khilaaf the, kyonki ve use hindu dharm main dafaindaazi or ek khataranaak nazir ke rup main dekh rahe the
 The act raised the minimum age for a girl to be married from 10 to 12 years
 british sarkaar ne tilak ko 6varsh ke karavaas kii sajaa sunai, dauraan karavaas tilak ne kuch kitabo kii maang kii lekin british sarkaar ne unhe aise kisi patr ko likhane par roak lagaayi thi jisame rajnatik gatividhiyaan ho
 a book was also written in Tilak Karawas, shortly before the completion of Karawas, the wife of Bal Gangadhar Tilak passed away
 The news of this Dhukhad news came from a letter he received in jail
 or tilak ko is baat kaa behad afsos tha kii ve apni mratak patni ke antim darshan bhi nahin kar sakate
 Lala Lajpat Rai founded the Home Rule League with the help of Annie Besant
 It was not like a Satyagraha movement
 It consisted of forming groups of four or five people who would meet with big politicians and lawyers all over India and explain the meaning of Home Rule League
 The Annie Besant who came to India from Ireland, he saw the experiment there like the Homerule League, he thought of doing the same experiment in India
 tilak ne marathi main kesari or angreji main maratha naam se do dainik samachar patr shuru kiye jo janata main bahut lokapriy hue
 Tilak criticized the brutality of the British rule and the inferiority complex towards Indian culture
 inhone maang kii ki british sarkaar turant bharatiyon ko purna swaraj de
 Due to his articles appearing in Kesari, he was sent to jail many times
 tilak bhartiya rashtriya congress main shaamil hue lekin jald hi ve congress ke narampanthi ravaiye ke viruddh bolne lage
 In 1907, the Congress split into a hot party and a soft party
 garam dal main tilak ke saath lala lajpat raay or bipin chandra paal shaamil the
 All three came to be known as lal-bal-pal
 1908 main tilak ne krantikari prafull chaaki or khudiram bose ke bam hamale kaa samarthan kiya jisaki vajah se unhen burma sthit mandley kii jail bhej diya gaya
 Freed from prison, he again joined the Congress and in 1916 founded the All India Home Rule League with Annie Besant and Muhammad Ali Jinnah
 san 1919 i
 main congress kii amritsar baithak main hissaa lene ke liye swadesh lautne ke samay tak tilak itane naram ho gayi the ki unhone montegue-chamsford sudhaaron ke zariye sthapit legislative concil ke chunaav ke bahishkaar kii gandhi kii niti kaa virodh hi nahin kiya
 Instead, Tilak advised the delegates to follow their policy of responsive cooperation to implement the reforms that initiated the participation of Indians to some extent in regional governments
 lekin naye sudhaaron ko nirnaayak disha dene se pehle hi 1 agast,1920 i
 ko bombay main unki mrityu ho gayi
 Posthumously paying tribute, Gandhiji called him the creator of modern India and Jawaharlal Nehru called him the father of Indian revolution

 Objectivism is the Hindiization of positivism
 francisi shabd "pajitiph" se udbhoot positivism "nishchit", asandigdh" evam "dridhtaapurvak kahe jane" ke arth main prayukt hota he
 This experiential element is applicable to all empirical philosophies, leaving scientific speculation and earlier assumptions to be confined to empiricists
 kont ne yah pad vichaar tathaa jivan kii us pranali ke liye chunaa tha jo gyaan ko keval yatharth bhautik ghatnaon kii khojon tathaa vidhiyon par aadhaarit maanati he parantu vibhinn sandarbhon main prayukt hokar "vastunishthawad" yatharth, nishchit evam shuddh ke atirikt upyogi, saapeksh, niyambaddh tathaa sahanubhutipurna bhi ban gaya
 Although scientific methods have been used in ancient times in Babylonia, Egypt and Greece, and in modern times by Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Bacon, and Decart, in the achievement of systematic knowledge, "objectivism" is generally used only for the philosophy of Kant
 Is that which accepts more usefulness of scientific knowledge in the face of knowledge of imperceptible power, because it Authorizes natural powers and gives yoga in human elevation
 kont ke anusaar vaigyanik vidhiyon ke atirikt vaigyanik drushtikon apnaanaa bhi aavashyak he jisase bhautik ghatnaon kii bhanti hi jivan ke naitik evam saamaajik vyapaar bhi vyavasthit tathaa krambaddh kiye ja saken
 Like Hume, object nihilism does not adopt skeptical or agnostic injunctive philosophy, abandoning imperceptible hypotheses, but certainly proves that in addition to sensations, experience provides scientific rules that are only probable based on the imperceptible hypothesis of the uniformity of nature, but Outstanding are superior to absolute
 kont ne "vastunishthavadi darshan" main saanskrithik vikaas kii teen avasthaaon ke moulik niyamon ke dwaara vastunishthavadi darshan ke arthnirdhaaran kaa prayaas kiya he
 The first of the three stages, such as religious, philosophical and definite, arrive at God in search of the ultimate cause; Second, nature rests in contemplation of the unseen forces; And after finding the third fixed rules, one obtains the general rules
 vibhinn avasthaaen manushya jati kii shishav, kishor tathaa praudh avasthaaon kii dyotak hai
 Cultural development of human beings starts from the initial trend of humanization and reaches the objective level through the prestige of philosophical rules
 paramparaagat darshanon kii pratikriya ke rup main vastunishthawad kaa paryaapt prachaar, visheshkar, dakshin america main hua
 In the United States, the practice of pragmatism, new objectivism, critical objectivism, and inertialism led to the development of "logical empiricism", a particular form of objectivism that is adopting Kant's approach
 taarkik vastunishthawad hum ke anubhavvaad, kont ke vastunishthawad tathaa hwhiteead rasel ke taarkik vishleshan kaa vicitra sammishran he
 In order to serve the doubles purpose of providing safe havens to the sciences and the futility of psychic philosophy, he adopts the method of logical analysis of language, which makes him abandon traditional psychological analysis
 satyaapan kii prakriya ko hi kisi prastaavna kaa arth maanakar taarkik vastunishthavadi paramparaagat darshanik prashnon ko nirarthak maanate hai kyonki is naveen vyakhya ke anusaar indriatit vishyon se sambandhit hone ke kaaran ve koi arth nahin rakhte
 By treating evolution as a "rule of action" and scientific rules as "plans for unambiguous prepositions", logical empirical science presents a consistent picture according to which scientific hypotheses are completely excluded
 parantu vyakti ke anubhav par aadhaarit vigyaan main vastugatta kaa sarvatha abhaav hi hoga
 In this objective manner, nothing remains fixed and objective in this way
 anubhavvaad tathaa taarkik buddhivaad jaisi virdohi pravritiyon kaa yah rachanaatmak sanshleshan arth ke arthnirdhaaran main hi swayan apane siddhant ko tilanjali de detaa he
 Dhungachalna is a village development committee in Achham district of Seti region of Nepal

 ghaav kaa bharna yaa jakhm kii marammat ek jatil prakriya he jiske dwaara twachaa chot lagane ke baad swayan kii marammat karata he
 In normal skin, the epithelium and the endocarpus remain in a steady-state balance and maintain a protective barrier against the external environment
 rakshaatmak avrodh ke tuutate hi ghaav bharne kii saamaanya prakriya turant shuru ho jaati he
 The ideal paradigm for wound repair is divided into three or four successive, but overlapping stages: hemorrhage, inflammation, swelling, and reconstruction
 Injury to the skin is a complex biochemical event in the form of a closely operated falls to repair the wound
 chot lagane ke baad minuton main hi, thakkakoshikaayen jakhm ke sthaan par jamaa hokar ek fibrin thakke kaa nirmaan karte hai
 This clot acts to stop active bleeding
 shothakaari avasthaa main, jeevanuon or avasheshon kaa bhakshak koshikaon dwaara bhakshan kar liya jaataa he, tathaa aise kaarak mukt hote hai jo prafalan avasthaa main lagi koshikaon kaa pravaas or vibhaajan karavaate hai
 In the proliferative phase there is angiogenesis, collagen storage, formation of granulation tissue, subcutaneous and contraction of the wound
 raktavahika nirmaan main vaahikeey antarkaleey koshikaon dwaara nai raktavahikaaon kaa nirmaan hota he
 In the formation of fibroplasia and granulation tissue, fibrous cells are produced and secreted collagen and fibronectin to form new, functioning extracellular ganglion)
 saath hi, upartwacha kaa purnaupatvachikaran hota he, jisamen upartvachiya koshikaayen prafalit hoti hai or ghaav ke upar 'rengkar' nae oottak ke liye aavaran uplabdh karti hai
 In contraction, the wound is further reduced in size by the action of myofibroblast cells, which form a grip at the ends of the wound and compress themselves using a process similar to that of smooth muscle cells
 jab in koshikaon kii bhoomika puri hoti he, tab anaavashyak koshikaon kii swatah koshikamrityu ho jaati he
 In the maturation and remodeling stage, collagen is remodeled and rearranged along stress lines and cells that are not needed are automatically removed by cytoplasm
 lekin, yah prakriya na keval jatil, balki bhangur bhi hoti he, tathaa iske vichlit hone yaa asafal hone kii sambhaavna hoti he jisase dirghakaalik nasoor jakhm ban sakate hai
 Factors that help include diabetes, vein or artery disease, old age, and infection
 jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he, ghaavon kii marammat adarsh rup se raktasravastambhan, shothakaari, prafalan or purnirmaan avasthaaon main vibhajit kii gai he
 While a useful work, this model uses considerable overlap in individual situations
 haal hi main ek poorak pratimaan kaa varnan kiya gaya he, jisamen ghaav kii marammat ke kai tatv adhik spasht rup se prastut kiye gaye hai
 The importance of this new paradigm is reflected even more by its use in the fields of reconstructive medicine and tissue engineering
 is sanrachana main, jakhm ke bharne kii prakriya ko do mukhya avasthaaon main vibhajit kiya gaya he: praarambhik avasthaa or koshikeey avasthaa : In the early stages, which begin soon after the skin begins to form, there are molecular molecular and cellular events that lead to hemorrhage and the formation of an early, improvised extracellular ganglion — that is, cellular attachment and subsequent cellular proliferation
 Provides creative foundation
 praarambhik avasthaa ke baad koshikeey avasthaa aati he, jisamen kai tarah kii koshikaayen mil kar shothajnya pratikriya shuru karne, kanankur oottak ke sanshleshan or upartvachiya part ko panarsthapit karne kaa kaam karti hai
 The subdivisions of the cellular state are - macrophage and phylogenetic fraction, epithelium - mesenchymal interaction - reabsorption, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts - developmental systems, collagen production and ganglion contraction, endothelial cells and hemoglobin, cutaneous epithelium - formation and transformation elements
 shothakaari avasthaa ke shuru hone ke thik pehle, raktasrav avrodh kii prapti yaa fibrin thakke ke jariye raktasravastambhan yaa raktasrav rokane ke liye thakkaakaran prapaat hota he
 After that, various soluble factors are released that attract cells that, in addition to releasing molecules that initiate the proliferative state of wound repair, also feed on wastes, bacteria, and damaged tissues
 jab oottak pehali baar jakhmi hota he, to rakt colejan ke sampark main aata he, jisase rakt kii thakka koshikaayen shothakaari karkon kaa srav shuru karne lagati hai
 Clot cells also secrete glycoproteins on those cell membranes that help them stick to each other and collect and form a mass
 fibrin or fibronactin aapas main ulajh kar ek daat kaa nirmaan karte hai jo proteinon or kanon ko fansaakar or raktahani hone se roktaa he
 This stopper serves as the main anatomical basis for the wound until fibrinectin collagen accumulates
 pravasshil koshikaayen is daat kaa prayog reng kar aage badhane ke liye ek aadhaatri ke rup main karti hai or thakkakoshikaayen isse chipak kar karkon kaa srav karte hai
 The clot eventually disintegrates and is replaced by granulation tissue and later collagen
 jakhm hone ke thodi der baad sabase adhik sankhya main maujuud koshikaayen, thakka koshikaayen rakt main isiem proteinon sahit kai vastuon or vikaas karkon sahit cytocinon kaa srav karti hai
 Growth factors stimulate cells to increase their rate of division
 thakka koshikaayen anya shothasaayak karkon jaise, sirotonin, bradicinine, prastaglandinon, prastaciclinon, thrambaksen or histamine kaa bhi srav karti hai, jo kai uddeshyon ko puraa karte hai jinamein us kshetra main koshika-prafalan or pravaas main vruddhi or rakt vahikaaon kaa chaudaa hokar kharkhara bananaa shaamil he
 Immediately after a blood vessel rupture, torn cell membranes secrete inflammatory agents, such as thromboxanes and prostaglandins, which prevent blood loss by contracting the vessel and accumulate inflammatory cells and factors in that location
 yah vahikasankuchan paanch se das minute tak bana rahata he, jiske baad raktavahikaaon kaa failaav yani vahikaprasaran hota he, jo chot lagane ke 20 minuton baad sheersh par pahunch jaataa he
 Vasodilation is the result of clot cells and factors released by other cells
 vahikaprasaran main lipt mukhya kaarak histamine hota he
 Histamine also makes the blood vessels porous, causing the tissue to swell as proteins from the blood stream drain into the extracellular space, which increases its osmolar load and absorbs water in that area
 raktavahikaaon kii badi hui pargamyata shwetanuon jaisi shothakaari koshikaon ko raktapravaah se ghaav main pravesh karne main madad karti he
 Within an hour of wounding, polymorphic neutrophils) arrive at the wound site and form the main cells of the wound in the first two days after injury, especially on the second day
 unhen us sthaan par fibronactin, vikaas karkon or kynine jaise padaarthon dwaara aakarshith kiya jaataa he
 Neutrophils feed on wastes and bacteria and also destroy bacteria by releasing free radicals through a 'respiratory explosion'
 ve protiage kaa srav bhi karte hai jo hanigrast oottak ko vighatit karke ghaav kii safai bhi karte hai
 Neutrophils usually undergo autoimmunity after completing their functions and are devoured and degraded by the macrophages
 us kshetra main pravesh karne vaale anya shwetanuon main helper tii koshikaayen shaamil hoti hai, jo cytocinon kaa srav karke or tii koshikaon ke vibhaajan or shothakriya main vruddhi karti tathaa vahikaprasaran va vahika pargamyata badhaati hai
 t cells also increase the activity of macrophages
 ghaav ke bharne ke liye mahabhakshak atyaavashyak hote hai
 Within two days of injury, they replace pmns as the main cells in the wound
 ghaav-sthal kii ore thakka koshikaon va anya koshikaon dwaara nirgamit vikaas karkon dwaara aakarshith hokar rakt pravaah main se monosite raktavahikabhitiyon ke jariye us kshetra main pravesh karte hai
 The number of monocytes present in the wound reaches its apex within one to one and a half days after injury
 ghaav-sthal par ek baar pahunchane ke baad, monosite paripakv hokar mahabhakshakon main badal jate hai
 Half the amount of all the monocytes in the spleen is always ready for use on injured tissue
 mahabhakshak kii mukhya bhoomika jeevanuon or kshatigrast oottak kaa bhakshan karnaa hota he, or ve protiajon kaa nirgam karke kshatigrast oottak ko hataate bhi hai
 Macrophages also secrete many factors such as growth factors and other cytokines, especially in the fourth and fifth days after wounding
 These factors attract cells participating in the proliferative phase of repair to that region, although they may curb them in the narrowed state
 mahabhakshakon ko unke chaaron ore oxygen kii maatra main kami dwaara aise karkon kaa utpaadan karne ke liye prerit kiya jaataa he, jo raktavahikanirmaan utprerit karte or usamen teji laate hai, or ve aisi koshikaon ko bhi uttejit karte hai, jo ghaav kaa purnaupartvachikaran, tathaa kanankur oottak or nae bahyakoshikeey aadhaatri kaa nirmaan karte hai
 By secreting these factors, macrophages contribute to move the wound repair process to the next stage
 jaise-jaise shoth-kriya khatm hoti he, shothakaari karkon ke srav main kami hone lagati he, pehle se maujuud kaarak kaa vighatan ho jaataa he or ghaav-sthal par neutrophilon or mahabhakshakon kii sankhya kam ho jaati he
 These changes indicate that the inflammatory phase is ending and the proliferative stage is about to begin
 twachaa ke samaan pratimaan kaa prayog karke praapt sharir ke baahar praapt sabooton ke anusaar, mahabhakshakon kii maujuudagi vastav main ghaav ke sankuchan ko dhimaa kar sakati he or isaliye ghaav se mahabhakshakon kaa adrishy hona aage kii avasthaaon ke hone ke liye aavashyak ho saktaa he
 Since inflammation plays roles in fighting infection, removing waste and inducing the proliferative stage, it is an essential part of wound healing
 lekin, bahut adhik der tak rahane par shothakriya ke kaaran oottak ko kshati pahunch sakati he
 Thus, reduction of inflammation in the perspective of treatment is often a goal
 shothakriya tab tak rahati he jab tak ghaav main avshesh maujuud hota he
 Therefore, the presence of dirt or other things can prolong the inflammatory phase, causing the wound to become chronic
 ghaav hone ke do yaa teen dinon baad, tantukoshikaayen ghaav-sthal main pravesh karne lagati hai, jisase shothakaari avasthaa ke samaapt hone ke pehle hi prafalan avasthaa shuru ho jaati he
 Like other wound repair stages, the stages of the proliferative phase are partially overlapping in time rather than in a chain
 raktavahikanirmaan kii prakriya, jise navvahikeekaran bhi kaha jaataa he, antarkaleey koshikaon ke ghaav ke kshetra main pravaas karne par tantukoshikaon ke prafalan ke saath saath-saath hoti he
 Since fibroblasts and epithelial cells require oxygen and nutrients, angiogenesis is necessary for other stages of wound repair, such as migration of epithelial and fibroblasts
 jis oottak main raktavahikanirmaan hota he vah keshavahikaaon kii upasthiti ke kaaran laal dikhaai detaa he
 Stem cells of endothelial cells originating from parts of intact blood vessels generate spurious cell projections and enter the wound site from the ECM to form new blood vessels
 antarkaleey koshikaayen ghaav ke kshetra kii ore fibrin papadi par paae jane vaale fibronactin or anya koshikaon dwaara nirgamit vahikajanak karkon dwaara rasinic sparsh dwaara aakarshith kii jaati hai, udaa
 kam-oxygen ke vaataavaran main mahabhakshakon or thakkakoshikaon dwaara
 antarkaleey vikaas or prafalan bhi oxygen kii alpata or ghaav main lactic amla kii maujuudagi dwaara sidhe uttejit hota he
 To migrate, endothelial cells need collagen and plasminogen stimulants to clot and degrade part of the ECM
 jaste par nirbhar hone vaali metaloprotinoge koshika pravaas, prafalan or raktavahikanirmaan hone dene ke liye taleey jhilli or isiem ko pachaa leti hai
 When macrophages and other growth factor-producing cells come out of a low-oxygen, lactic acid-filled environment, they stop producing angiogenic factors
 is prakaar, jab oottak main paryaapt rup se rakt pravaah hone lagata he, antarkaleey koshikaon kaa pravaas or prafalan kam ho jaataa he
 Ultimately, the blood vessels that are no longer needed die by spontaneous death
 raktavahikanirmaan ke saath hi, tantukoshikaayen ghaav sthal par ekatrit hona shuru kar detii hai
 Fibroid cells begin entering the wound site two to five days after wounding, when the inflammatory phase is ending, and their numbers reach the peak one to two weeks after wounding
 pehle saptaah ke ant tak, tantukoshikaayen ghaav main mukhya koshikaayen hoti hai
 Fibroplasia ends two to four weeks after wounding
 chot lagane ke baad ke pehle do yaa teen dinon main, tantukoshikaayen mukhyatya pravaas va prafalan karti hai, jabaki baad main, ve ghaav sthal main colejan aadhaatri banane vaali mukhya koshikaayen hoti hai
 These fibroblasts are thought to have originated from nearby intact skin tissue
 prarambh main tantukoshikaayen fibrin ke paar-sanyojit tantuon kaa prayog ghaav main pravaas karne ke liye karti hai or uske baad fibronactin se chipak jaati hai
 Fibroblasts then accumulate the main-substance and later collagen, in the bed of the wound, from which they can stick to migration
 kanankur oottak aviksit oottak kii tarah kaary karata he or jakhmi hone ke do se paanch dinon baad, ghaav ke shothakaari avasthaa main rahane ke samay hi prakat hone lagata he or ghaav kii shaiyya ke bharne tak viksit hota rahata he
 Granulocyte tissue contains new blood vessels, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and new functional extracellular epithelium fractions
 kaaryakari isiem sanrachana main saamaanya oottak kii isiem se bhinn hoti he or iske ansh tantukoshikaon main utpann hote hai
 These fractions include fibronectin, collagen, glycoaminoglycan, elastin, glycoprotein, and proteoglycan
 iske mukhya ansh fibronactin or hayalooronon hote hai, jo ek atyant jal-yukt aadhaatri kaa nirmaan karte hai tathaa koshika-pravaas main madad karte hai
 This executive half is later displaced by an ECM that is very similar to the ECM found in intact tissue
 vikaas kaarak, tijief-beta ) or fibronactin tantukoshikaon dwaara isiem anuon ke prafalan, ghaav kii shaiyya kii ore pravaas or utpaadan ko protsaahit karte hai
 Fibroblasts also secrete growth factors that attract epithelial cells to the wound site
 oxygen kii kami bhi tantukoshikaon ke prafalan or vikaas karkon ke nikaas main bhaag leti he, haalanki, oxygen kii bheeshan kami unke vikaas or isiem ke anshon ke jamaav ko roak kar atyadhik, tantumay dhabbe utpann kar sakati he
 One of the most important functions of fibroblasts is to produce collagen
 colejan kaa jamaav aavashyak hota he kyonki yah ghaav kii majbootee ko badhaata he- iske banane ke pehle ghaav ko band rakhane vaali ekmaatr vastu fibrin-fibronactin thakka hota he, jo chot se utpann hone vaale jakhm ko adhik pratirodh uplabdh nahin karaata
 saath hi, shothakriya, raktavahikanirmaan or sanyoji utak-nirmaan main lagi koshikaayen tantukoshikaon dwaara nirmit colejan aadhaatri par sanlagn hoti, badhati or vibhedit hoti hai
 a good amount of type 3 collagen and fibronectin production, usually depending on the size of the lesion, usually occurs between about 10 hours to 3 days
 unka jamaav ek se teen hafton main sheersh par pahunch jaataa he
 They are the predominant tensile material until the end of the maturation stage, at which time they are displaced by stronger type 1 collagen
 jis samay tantukoshikaayen nae colejan kaa utpaadan kar rahi hoti hai, usee samay colemonez or anya kaarak use avakramit bhi karte jate hai
 Shortly after wounding, synthesis is higher than degradation, leading to increased levels of collagen in the wound, but subsequent production and degradation becomes equal, leaving the total gain in collagen to zero
 yah samarupata baad kii paripakvan avasthaa kii shuruuaat kaa sanket detii he
 Granulation ends slowly and the number of fibroblasts begins to decrease once their function is finished in the wound
 kanankuran avasthaa kii samaapti par, tantukoshikaayen swatahkoshikamrityu karnaa shuru kar detii hai, jisase kanankur oottak koshikaon se prachur vaataavaran se mukhyatya colejan se yukt vaataavaran main pahunch jaataa he
 The formation of granulation tissue in the open wound is helpful for the re-epithelialization stage, whereby epithelial cells migrate to the new tissue to form a dam between the wound and the environment
 ghaav ke siron or twachaa ke anubandhon jaise kesh putikaaon, swead grathiyon or sebumyukt grathiyon kii aadharbhoot kerratin koshikaayen ghaav kii marammat kii upartvachikaran avasthaa ke liye jimmedaar mukhya koshikaayen hai
 They spread as a layer on the wound site and proliferate at its ends and stop only when they are mixed in between
 kerratinkoshikaayen pehle bina prafalit hue pravaas karti hai
 Migration can begin within a few hours of the injury
 lekin, pravaas karne ke liye upartvachiya koshikaon ko jivit oottak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, isaliye yadi ghaav gaharaa ho to use pehle kanankur oottak se bharaa janaa chaiye
 In this way, the time of onset of migration may vary and may be approximately one day after the injury
 ghaav ke siron kii koshikaayen jakhmi hone ke baad duusare or tisare din prafalit ho sakati hai, taaki pravaas ke liye adhik koshikaayen uplabdh ho saken
 If there is no disruption of the planar membrane, epithelial cells are displaced within three days by division and upward migration of cells in the baseline layer in the same manner as in intact skin
 lekin yadi ghaav-sthal par taleey jhilli nasht ho jaae to purnaupartvachikaran ghaav ke siron or twachaa ke anubandhon jaise kesh putikaaon va swead or tel grathiyon se hona aavashyak hota he, jo jivit kerratinkoshikaon se saji twachaa main pravesh karti hai
 If the wound is too deep, skin contractions can also be destroyed and then migration can only occur from the ends of the wound
 ghaav-sthal par kerratinkoshikaon kaa pravaas sampark-avrodh ke abhaav or nitric oxide jaise rasayanon dwaara uttejit hota he
 Prior to migration, cells have to dislodge their desmosomes and hematidosomes, which usually bind the cells to other cells and the ECM in their cytoplasm by secondary fibers
 integrin naamak parzilli receptor protein, jo glycoproteinon se bane hote hai or saamanyatya koshika ko uske koshikapanjar dwaara taleey jhilli se baandhe rakhte hai, koshika ke madhyamik tantuon dwaara nirgamit kiye jate hai or actin tantuon ko pravaas ke samay visthapit karke nakli koshika sataha ke liye isiem ke sanlagnak kii tarah kaam main laate hai
 In this way, keratinocytes separate from the planar membrane and are able to enter the bed of the wound
 pravaas karne ke pehle kerretinokoshikaayen apane aakaar ko badal leti hai or lambii va sapaat hokar lemelepodia jaise koshikeey pravaradh va jhaalar jaise dikhne vaale chaude pravaradh utpann kar leti hai
 Actins also become filaments and phimocytes
 pravaas ke samay, nakli koshikaon ke integrin isiem se jud jate hai or pravaradh ke actin tantu koshika ko saath khinch le jate hai
 The interaction of molecules in the ECM via integrin further enhances the formation of actin fibers, lamellipedia and phyllopodia
 pravaas karne ke liye upartvachiya koshikaayen ek duusare par chadh jaati hai
 This growing layer of epithelial cells is often called the epithelial tongue
 taleey jhilli se judane vaali pehali koshikaayen aadharbhoot parat kaa nirmaan karti hai
 These basal cells migrate over the wound bed and epithelial cells above them also move with them
 jitani jaldi yah pravaas hota he, chot kaa nishaan utana hi chota hota he
 Fibrin, collagen, and fibronectin in the ECM may further signal cells to divide and migrate
 tantukoshikaon kii tarah, pravasshil kerratinkoshikaayen shothakriya ke samay jamaa hue fibrin ke saath paar-sanyojit hue fibronactin kaa prayog rengkar aage badhane ke liye sangyojan sthal ke rup main karti hai
 As keratinocytes migrate, they grow from the granulation tissue, but below the scab and separate it from the tissue below
 upartvachiya koshikaon main vyarth padaarth jaise mrit oottak or jeevanu padaarthon kaa bhakshan karne kii kshamta hoti he, jo anyathaa unka maarg avaruddha kar saktaa he
 Since they have to dissolve any crust that is forming, the migration of keratinocytes is best enhanced by moist environments, as larger and harder crusts are formed in dry environments
 oottak main apana rasta banane ke liye, kerratinkoshikaon dwaara thakke, kachare or isiem ke bhaagon ko vighatit karnaa aavashyak he
 They secrete plasminogen-activator, which activates plasminogen and converts it into plasmin to dissolve the crust
 koshikaayen keval jivit oottak par hi pravaas kar sakati hai, isaliye unka colegnejon or aadhaatri metacoproteinjon jaise protiajon kaa nikaas karnaa aavashyak hota he, taaki ve apane maarg main aane vaale isiem ke kshatigrast bhaagon ko khatm kar saken, visheshkar pravasshil parat ke saamne
 kerratinkoshikaayen taleey jhilli ko bhi ghol detii hai or uski bajaay reng kar badhane ke liye tantukoshikaon dwaara banaai gai nai isiem kaa prayog karti hai
 As keratinocytes continue to migrate, new epithelial cells are required to be replaced at the ends of the wound, leaving more cells available for the growing layer
 pravasshil kerratinkoshikaon ke peeche prafalan saamanytah jakhmi hone ke kuch dinon baad shuru hota he or saamaanya utakon ke mukaable uski dar upartvachikaran kii is avasthaa main 17 guna adhik hoti he
 The epithelial cells that proliferate until the entire wound is formed are only at the ends of the wound
 integrinon or emempi dwaara uttejit vikaas kaarak koshikaon ko ghaav ke siron par prafalit hone ke liye protsaahit karte hai
 Keratinocytes themselves also produce and secrete factors including growth factors and planar membrane proteins, which help in epithelialization and other stages of wound repair
 vikaas kaarak neunajeevanuvirohi peptidon or kerratinkoshikaon main neutrophil chemotactic cytocininon ke utpaadan ke protsaahan dwaara twachaa ke ghaavon kii aantarik pratirodhi raksha ke liye bhi mahatvapurn hote hai
 Keratinocytes continue to migrate from the wound bed until the cells on either side meet in the middle, at which point inhibition by contact prevents them from migrating
 jab ve pravaas band kar detii hai, tab kerratinkoshikaayen un proteinon kaa srav karti hai jo nai taleey jhilli kaa nirmaan karte hai
 The cells reverse the transformation of the donor to initiate migration - they reassemble the desmosomes and the hematismosomes and then once again attach to the planar membrane
 aadharbhoot koshikaayen purnaupartvachiya twachaa main paye jane vaali parton ko purnsthapit karne ke liye usee tarah se vibhajit or vibhedit hone lagati hai jaisaa ki ve saamaanya twachaa main karti hai
 Contraction is the main state of wound repair
 yadi sankuchan adhik der tak hua, to usase vikruti or kaaryakshmata kii haani ho sakati he
 Therefore considerable interest has been shown in understanding the biology of wound contraction, which can be modeled outside the body using a collagen gel contraction probe or dermal-like pattern
 sankuchan jakhmi hone ke lagbhag ek hafte baad shuru hota he, jab tantukoshikaayen peshitantukoshikaon main viksit hoti hai, purna motaai vaale ropanon main sankuchan jakhm hone ke baad 5 se 15 dinon main apane sheersh tak pahunch jaataa he
 The contraction may continue for several weeks and may persist even after the wound has been completely reabsorbed
 koi bada jakhm sankuchan ke baad 40 se 80 pratishat chota ho saktaa he
 According to loosening of tissue in the injured part, the lesions may be compressed to a speed of 0
75 mm per day
 sankuchan saadharantaya samametiya tareeke se nahin hota - balki adhiktar ghaavon ke sankuchan kaa ek aksh hota he, jo koshikaon ko colejan ke saath behatar sanghathan or sammelan karne detaa he
 First, contraction occurs without myofibroblasts
 baad main vikaas karkon dwaara uttejit tantukoshikaayen peshitantukoshikaon main badal jaati hai
 Myofibroblasts that resemble smooth muscle cells are responsible for contraction
 peshitantukoshikaon main usee tarah kaa actin hota he jaisaa chikani peshi koshikaon main paaya jaataa he
 Myofibroblasts move by fibrinectin and fibrinectin in the temporal ECM to reach the ends of the wound, attracted by fibronectin and growth factors
 ve ghaav ke siron par isiem se sampark banaati hai or aapas main tathaa ghaav ke siron se desmosomon dwaara judati hai
 At the same time, the actin of myofibroblasts binds to extracellular epithelial molecules such as fibronectin and collagen across the cell membrane at an incumbent called fibronaxus
 peshitantukoshikaon ke aise kai avlamb ho sakate hai, jo sankuchan ke samay unhen isiem ko khinchne dete hai, jisase ghaav kaa aakaar chota ho jaataa he
 In this part of contraction, the wound closes more rapidly than the first part of the non-fibroblast
 jaise-jaise peshitantukoshikaon main actin sankuchit hota he, ghaav ke sire khinchate jate hai
 With contraction of myofibroblasts, fibroblasts are laying collagen to make the wound stronger
 prafalan main sankuchan kaa charan peshitantukoshikaon ke sankuchan band karne or swatahkoshikamrityu kar lene ke saath samaapt ho jaataa he
 The dissolution of the temporary moiety leads to a decrease in hyaluronic acid and an increase in chondritin sulfate, which gradually inhibits the migration and proliferation of fibroblasts
 ye ghatnaayen ghaav bharne kii paripakvan avasthaa kaa sanket hoti hai
 When the levels of collagen production and degradation are equal, the maturation stage of tissue repair is assumed to begin
 paripakvan ke samay, tip 3 colejan, jo prafalan ke samay pramukhataa leti he, dhire-dhire avakramit hone lagati he or uske sthaan par adhik majboot tip 1 colejan bichaai jaati he
 Originally disintegrated collagen fibers are rearranged and cross-linked and deposited along stress lines
 paripakvan avasthaa kaa prarambh ghaav ke aakaar or shuru main uske band kiye jane yaa khulaa chhod diye jane ke anusaar bada bhinn ho saktaa he, or yah kareeb 3 dinon se 3 hafton tak main ho saktaa he
 Similarly, the maturation stage can continue for a year or more depending on the type of wound
 jaise-jaise yah avasthaa aage badhati he, ghaav kii tanan shakti badhati he, jo chot lagane ke baad teen maheenon main saamaanya oottak kii takat ke 50 pratishat tak or antat uske 80 pratishat tak shaktishaalee ho jaati he
 As the activity at the wound site decreases, the scar leaves its redness, as the blood vessels are no longer needed, and they are removed by autoimmunity
 ghaav kii marammat ke charan saamanyatya purvanumaan yogya, samayik tareeke se hote hai –yadi aisa na ho to marammat anuchit rup se hokar dirghakaalik jakhm jaise shira ke vrin yaa rogajanya nishaan jaise keelide daag main badal sakati he
 Until a decade ago, ideal examples of wound repair, in which stem cell involvement is restricted to organ-specific lineages, were never seriously challenged
 tab se, vayask stem koshikaon ke koshikeey lachak se yukt hone yaa gaiyr-vanshavali vaali koshikaon main viksit hone kii kshamta kaa vichaar ek vaikalpik vyakhya ke rup main ubhara he
 More precisely, blood cell progenitor cells may have the ability to transform back into blood cell stem cells by de-differentiation and / or differentiate into non-lineage cells, such as fibroblasts
 bahusksham vayask stem koshikaon main swatahnavikaran or vibhinn koshika prakaar utpann karne kii kshamta hoti he
 Stem cells produce progenitor cells, which cannot self-renew, but can produce many types of cells
 twachaa ke ghaav kii marammat main stem koshikaon kii bhagidaari kii seemaa pechida he or puri tarah se samajhi nahin gai he
 It is understood that the epithelium and skin are reconstituted by mitosis-activated stem cells, which reside at the apex of the reticulum, the protuberances of the hair follicles, and the proliferative skin
 iske alaava, asthi majja main bhi twachaa ke ghaavon kii marammat main mukhya bhoomika nibhaane vaali stem koshikaayen ho sakati hai
 In rare circumstances, such as extensive scarring of the skin, autoimmunity subbodies of the bone marrow may be induced to participate in the repair process, where they produce collagen-secreting cells, which play a role in wound repair
 She plays ye do swatahnavikaran upaabaadiyaan hai, asthi majja se utpann messenkimal stem koshikaayen ) or raktanirmaan prajnak koshikaayen )
 In the bone marrow, there is also a progenitor subadivine) which is used to help in the reconstruction of blood vessels under similar conditions
 saath hi, yah samajha jaataa he ki, twachaa ko lagi vyapak chot jakhmi bhaag par shwetanuon ke ek anokhe upvarg ko bhi sheeghra pahunchane ke liye prerit karti he, jahaan ve ghaav kii marammat se sambandhit vibhinn kaary karte hai
 There is a slight difference between 'repair' and 'reproduction'
 kisi bhi oottak ke rup or / yaa kaaryakshmata main vyavdhaan ko chot kehete hai
 Repair refers to the physiologic adaptation of the component in an attempt to restore order without complete replacement of lost or damaged tissue after injury
 shaashvat oottak purnutpatti kaa matlab khoe yaa kshatigrast hue oottak kii bilkul waisi hi nakal kaa purnsthaapan karne se he, jisamen rup or kaaryakshmata donon hi puri tarah se purnsthapit ho jate hai

 In addition to providing support for fibroblast and endothelial cell binding, biodegradable scaffolds inhibit wound contraction, leading to the repair process leading to more remodeling / less scarring

 Basic root extract methods are numerical methods that allow an equation f = 0 to be given if there is a value of x that satisfies this equation
 x kaa vah maan falan f kaa 'mul' kehalaata he
 It is also called the 'solution' of the equation f = 0
 mul nikalne ke liye sabse pahle drigati samikaran ko solve karna hoga ise aap aasani se eqition solve kar payege Chintal Manepalli is a village in Adilabadu district under the Andhra Pradesh state of India in Kautal division
 2386 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year of the year 2386 BC or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 2386 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kali Yuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

 Motivating Hindu youth power towards a positive role towards society is also the main task of Bajrang Dal
 US intelligence agency CIA has put Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in "nationalist Organization" category and Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal are religious extremist organizations It has been told that there is intense opposition across the country, in the World Fact Book released by the CIA, the VHP and the Bajrang Dal 'secret' Itik pressure group has been included in the category of 'l oktober 1984 main vishwa hindu parishad ne ayodhya main niyamit rup se shobhaayatra nikaalani shuru kii

 The Jataka or Jataka Pali or Jataka stories are the 10th part of the Khuddakanikaya under the Sutpitaka of the Buddhist scripture Tripitaka
 in kathaon main mahatma buddha ke purv janmon kii kathayen hai
 Which is believed to have been told by Gautam Buddha himself, although some scholars believe that some Jataka stories have been told by his disciples after Gautam Buddha

 The Jataka is the tenth famous text of the Khadak body
 jataka ko vastutah granth na kahkar granth samooh hi kahana adhik upyukt hoga
 Some of his plot is in the form of a complete book and sometimes his stories are in the form of brief epics
 jataka shabd jan dhaatu se bana he
 It means past or emotion
 ‘jan’ dhaatu main ‘kt’ pratyay jodakar yah shabd nirmit hota he
 When metal is used in the ghost sense, when the meaning is done, then the story and form are created
 bhav arth main prayukt karne par jaat-jani-janan-janm arth banataa he
 In this way, the meaning of the word 'jataka' is 'jat' meaning birth-related
 ‘jataka’ bhagwaan buddha ke purv janm sambandhi kathaayen he
 God Buddha is called Bodhisattva before he attains enlightenment
 ve us samay buddhatv ke liye ummidavaar hote hai or daan, sheel, maitri, satya aadi das parmitaaon athwa paripurnataaon kaa abhyaas karte hai
 They sacrifice their lives many times for the sake of spirituality

 The word Bodhisattva itself means an industrial creature for Bodhi
 bodhi ke liye he satv jiskaa aisa arth bhi kuch vidwaanon ne kiya he
 In the Pali Sutras, we read many times, "before attaining enlightenment, at the time of not being Buddha, when i was a Bodhisattva", etc
 atah bodhisattva se spasht taatpary gyaan, satya dayaa aadi kaa abhyaas karne vaale us sadhak se he jiskaa aage chalakar buddha hona nishchit he
 Lord Buddha had not only been a Bodhisattva in his last birth before the state of enlightenment, but he also followed the Bodhisattva practice in many of his earlier births
 jataka kii kathaayen bhagavan buddha ke in vibhinn purvajanmon se jabaki ve bodhisattva rahe the, sambandhit hai
 He is portrayed as the protagonist in most stories

 Some of the Jataka stories have been named from the first words of the saga that came in the Jataka, namely - Apataka Jataka; According to one's protagonist, vānupath jātaka; According to the births of the Bodhisattva, such as Nigradh Mig Jataka, Machta Jataka, etc
 sabhi jataka kathaayen gautamabuddha ke dwaara kahi gayi he, jataka buddha samaykalin he, jaatakon kii nishchit sankhya kitni he, iskaa nirnay karnaa bada kathin he
 According to the custom prevalent in Lanka, Burma and Siam, the Jataka are 550

 '' Panasa Dhakani Panchasatani Jatakanti Veditabb
 ‘‘ atthasalini kii nidaan katha main bhi -pannasadhikani panchajatakasatani‘‘ he
 The number is broadly fixed
 jataka ke vartmaan rup main 547 jataka kahaniyaan pai jaati hai
 But this number is also only upper
 jatakatthawannanakaar ne vishaywastu kii drushti se inhen paanch virgon main vibhajit kiya he- Many of the Jataka stories are also found in two places with little variation or have been embedded in each other, and likewise many Jataka stories are found in sutta-pitaka, vinaya-pitaka, and other Pali texts, but In the present form of Jataka is not stored
 atah jaatakon kii sankhya main kaaphi kami kii bhi or briddhi kii bhi sambhaavna he
 For example, the story of Munik Jataka and Saluk Jataka is same, but only two names have come from different places
 iske vipareet ‘munik jataka’ naam ke do jataka hote hue unki bhi katha bhinn-bhinn he
 This is also the case for two people named Machh Jataka
 kahi-kahin do swatantra jaatakon ko milakar ek tisare jataka kaa nirmaan kar diya gaya he
 For example, both the Panchapandit Jataka and the Dakarakkhas Jataka are inhabited by the Maha Ummag Jataka
 jo kathaayen jataka-katha ke rup main anyatra pai jaati hai, kintu ‘jataka’ main sangruhit nahin he, unka bhi kuch ullekh kar dena aavashyak hoga
 The Ghatikar of the Majjhim body- Sutta or Ghatikar Sutta is one such Jataka story which is not found in 'jataka'
 isi prakaar dirghanikaay kaa mahagovind sutt jo swayan jataka kii nidaan katha main bhi ‘mahagovind jataka’ ke naam se nirdisht hua he, jataka ke andar nahin paaya jaataa he
 Similarly, in Dhammapadatthakatha and Milind Panha, some such Jataka tales have been quoted, which are not stored in Jataka
 atah kuch jataka nishchit rup se kitne he iskaa thik nirnay nahin ho saktaa
 When we consider the number of the Jataka, the Jataka means a story with a special title, which describes the life-related event of the Bodhisattva, no matter how many different stories are interwoven in that one
 Are given
 yadi kul kahaniyaan gini jaay to jataka main kareeb teen hajaar kahaniyaan pai jaati hai
 The Jatakas have in fact been compiled on the basis of sutta-pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 sutt -pitak main anek aisi kathaayen he jinka upyog vahaan upadesh dene ke liye kiya gaya he
 But the Bodhisattva is not mentioned in it
 yah kaam baad main karke prayek kahani ko jataka kaa rup de diya gaya he
 Tittir Jataka and Dighit Kosal Jataka are similarly constructed from Chullavagg and Mahavagga respectively of vinaya-pitaka
 manikanth jataka bhi vinay-pitak par hi aadhaarit he
 Similarly, the Kootadanta Sutta and Mahasudassana Sutta of the long-body and the Makhadeva Sutta of the Majjhim body are also Jataka in full sense
 kam se kam 13 jaatkaan kii khoj vidwaanon ne sutt pitak or vinay-pitak main kii hai
 Although the stories related to Rajkatha chor-katha and similar fears, war, village, corporation, city, district, women, panaghat, ghost and ghost etc
 were seen in terms of helplessness in the monk's union by calling it sordid stories
 phir bhi upadesh ke liye kathaon kaa upyog bhikshu log kuch-na-kuch maatra main karte hi the
 God himself has also preached religion through similes and parables

 The stories prevalent in public society have also been taken somewhere, but they have been given a new moral form, which is a feature of Buddhism
 atah sabhi jataka kathaon par buddha dharm kii puri chhap he
 They may have the basis of folk lectures from earlier traditions, but their entire structure is compatible with the moral ideal of Buddhism
 buddha vachanon kaa vargeekaran nau angon ke rup main kiya gaya he, jinke naam hai- This nine types of division of the Buddha verses is only in terms of their style forms or patterns, not in terms of texts
 itane prakaar ke buddha upadesh hote the, yahi is vargeekaran kaa abhipraay he
 The division of the Buddha's verses into nine parts of which the number of Jataka is seventh is very ancient
 atah jataka kathaayen sarvansh main pali-sahitya ke mahatvapurn evam aavashyak ang hai
 Uncertainty about their numbers has arisen, especially due to their timely collection of Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka and other sources, and their own assortment of Pali Pitaka and their intermingling
 chull niddes main hamen keval 500 jaatakon kaa kaa ullekh miltaa he
 In the fifth century AD, Chinese traveler Fahyan saw pictures of 500 natives printed in Lanka
 dwitiya tritiy shatabdi isvi purv ke bharhut or sanchi ke stupon main jaatakon ke chitra ankit mili hai
 Out of which pictures of at least 27 or 29 natives were identified by Rais Davids
 tab se kuch anya jataka kahaniyon kii pahchaan bhi in stupon kii pashaan-veshtoniyon par kii ja chuki hai
 All these facts are indicative of the ancientness and development of the native
 sthaviravaadi pali sahitya ke samaan sanskrit buddha dharm ke granthon main bhi jataka kathaayen pai jaati hai
 Like the Nawang Buddha word of Pali, Dwad Sh Anga here is considered to be the scripture
 in donon hi jagah jataka ek ang yaa dharm-pravachan ke bhaag ke rup main vidyaman he
 In the Buddhist Sanskrit text Jatakamala, which is told the composition of Aryasur, 34 Jataka stories are found

 Probably he was a poet of the fourth century AD
 lokottaravaadiyon ke prasiddh granth mahavastu main jo 200 i0 purv se 400 i0 tak ke bich ke kaal main likhi gai, kareeb 80 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Some of them are similar to Pali Jataka and there are also some that are not found in Pali Jataka
 rais davids kaa kathan he ki jataka kaa sankalan or pranayan madhya desh main pracheen janakathaon ke aadhaar par hua
 Winternitz has also often expressed this view
 adhikansh jataka buddhakalin he
 The inscriptions of Sanchi and Bharhut's scenes on the stone-vestas give ample evidence of their pre-ashoka period
 jataka ke kaal or kartrutv ke sambandh main adhik prakaash uske saahitiyik rup or visheshtaon ke vivechan se padegaa
 Each Jataka tale is divided into five parts
 panchuppannavatthu kaa arth he vartmaan kaal kii ghatana yaa katha
 The incident that took place during the lifetime of Buddha is Pachchuppannavatthu

 This is the circle of the past life is past
 prayek jataka kaa katha kii drushti sabase adhik mahatvapurn bhaag yah atitvatthu hi he
 According to this, Pachappannavatthu seems to have been built somewhere
 atitvatthu ke baad ek yaa anek gaathaayen aati hai
 Although they are related to the past only, but in some cases it is also related to the Pachappannavattu
 gaathaayen jataka ke pracheenatam ansh hai
 In fact only the gatakas are native
 pacchuppannavatthu aadi paanch bhaagon se samanvit jataka to vastav main jatakatthawannana yaa jataka main veyyakaran yaa atthav nnana aati he
 It contains interpretations and semantics of gathas
 sabase ant main samodhan aata he, jisamen atitvatthu ke paatro kaa buddha ke jivan kaal ke paatro ke saath sambandh milaayaa jaataa he, yatha us samay ataari par se shikaar khilne vaala shikari ab kaa dev dutt tha or kurung mrug to main tha hi, aadi aadi
 The Jataka contains the stories of the earlier births of the Buddha, while he completed various traditions in the form of the Bodhisattva and edited the qualifications for enlightenment
 sutt-pitak ke pratham chaar nikaayon main buddha ke aitihaasik rup kii hi pratishtha he
 Later in the Jataka, they are able to relate their historical life to the earlier stories
 jatakatthakatha kii nidaan katha main buddha jivan ke teen nidaan bataaye gayi hai, duure nidaan main atyant dur ateet kii buddha jivan kii katha he, aisa mana jaataa he ki atyant sudur ateet main buddha sumedh tapasvi banakar utpann hue the
 At that time he showed great loyalty to Dipankar Buddha, as a result he later blessed him to be Buddha
 anek janmon tak vibhinn sharir dhaaran karte hue sume dha tapasvi kii sadhana chalati rahi
 In the end, after leaving his body as Vesantar king, he went to the illiterate world
 sumedh tapasvi ke rup se lekar tushit lok main jane tak kii buddha kii yah sadhana katha dur nidaan ke antargat he
 547 Jataka stories are related to this second diagnosis of Buddha biography from Apanaka Jataka to Vesantara Jataka
 in kathaon se yahan taatpary he inamen varnit atitvatthu
 They are related to the short diagnosis of the life story of Buddha i
e
 these are the stories of the past
 lumbini van main janm lene ke samay se lekar bodhi-prapti tak kii katha avidure nidaan se sambandhit he
 That is, she is not so far away from the past
 bodhi prapti se lekar nirvana prapti tak kii buddha jeevani santike nidaan ke antargat he
 That is, she is near
 jataka kii pacchuppannavatthu main iske kuch ansh prastaavna rup main aate hai
 The Jataka stories contain stories of their past lives, contained within the second diagnosis of Buddha biography
 aitihaasik buddha ke jivan kii kisi ghatana kaa ullekh kar in duure nidaan kii kathaon ke kehane ke liye avkaash nikaal liya gaya he
 Whatever it is actually creates the native
 prayek jataka ke paanch angon ke uparyukt vivechan se spasht he ki jataka gadhy-padya mishrit rachanaayen hai
 The saga part is considered to be the oldest part of the native
 tripitak ke antarbhoot is gaatha bhaag ko hi maananaa adhik upyukt hoga
 The rest is fiction
 parantu jataka-kathaon kii prakruti aisi he ki mul ko vyakhya se alag kar dene par kuch bhi samaj main nahin aa saktaa
 Only the stories do not create the story
 unke upar jab vartmaan or ateet kii ghatnaon ko dhaanchaa chadhaaya jaataa he tabhi kathavstu kaa nirmaan hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to have the above five elements in the whole Jataka, in which all except the saga-part is its explanation, the latter is added
 phir bhi suvidha ke liye or aitihaasik drushti se galat dhang par ham uskon jataka kah dete hai
 In fact, the collection of 547 Jataka tales which are coordinated with the above mentioned five organs, we should not say Jatakattvavana or Jatakathakatha, as Jataka
 phosbal or kowal ne jiskaa kramshah roman lipi main or angreji main sampaadan or anuwaad kiya he yaa hindi main bhadant anand kausalyayan ne ‘jataka’ sheershak se 6 bhaagon main anuvaa da kiya he, vah vastav main jataka na hokar jataka kii vyakhya he
 The Jataka tales are basically only gathas, the rest is its interpretation
 gaatha or jataka ke shesh bhaag kaa kalkram aadi kii drushti se kya parsparik sambandh he yah prashn saamne aata he
 In the legend, the saga is called Abhinambabuddha saga or stories sung by Lord Buddha
 ve buddhavachan hai
 Therefore, she was a part of Tipitak and compiled from there, a structure of stories has been presented on her
 sampoorn jataka granth kii vishaywastu kaa jis aadhaar par vargeekaran hua he, usase bhi yahi spasht he ki gaatha-bhaag, yaa jise pinternitj aadi vidwaanon ne gaatha-jataka kaha he, vahiin uskaa muladhar he
 The classification of the Jataka text is based on the number of gathas and not on the basis of subject matter
 ther-theri gaathaon ke samaan vah bhi nipaton main vibhakt he
 The native has 22 falls
 pehle nipaat main 150 aisi kathaayen he jinamein ek kii ek gaatha pai jaati he
 There are 150 Jataka stories in the second fall, but two stories are found in each story
 isi prakaar tisare or chauthe nipaat main pachaas-pachaas kathaayen he or gaathaon kii sankhya kramshah teen-teen or chaar-chaar he
 Further, the same sequence often continues till the thirteenth fall
 chaudaaven nipaat kaa naam pakinnak nipaat he
 The number of gathas in this fall is varied from 14 to not according to the rules
 isliye iskaa naam pakinnak rakh diya gaya he
 10 stories are also found in some stories in this nipati and up to 47 in some stories
 aage ke nipaton main gaathaon kii sankhya nirantar badhati gai he
 The title of the fifteenth ninth is Vis Nispat, the Tis Nispat of the sixteenth, forty-nine Nishat of the seventeenth, Panas Nishat of the eighteenth, Sixty Nishat of the nineteenth, Sattinipat of the twentieth and Assinatipat of the twenty-seventh
 bisen nipaat main keval das jataka kathaayen he kintu prayek main gaathaon kii sankhya sau se bhi upar he
 The number of gathas in the last person is above seven hundred
 in sabase yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki jataka kathaon kii aadhaar gaathaayen hi he
 In the interpreting part of many Jataka stories themselves, the distinction between Pali and Atthakatha is shown, as in many other books of Pali Sutas and also in the books of Visuddhimagga
 jahaan tak jataka ke veyyakaran bhaag se sambandh he, vahaan pali kaa arth tipitak gat gaatha hi ho saktaa he
 From the evidence of language, the saga part is more ancient than the prose section
 pinternitj ne kaha he jataka kii sampoorn gaathaon ko tipitak kaa mul ansh nahin mana ja saktaa he
 There is also a distinction between them
 swayan jataka ke vargeekaran se hi yah spasht he
 In the fourteenth fall, the number of stories of each Jataka tale is not very much 14 as per the rules - somewhere is very high
 isi prakaar biswein nipaat main uski do jataka kathaon kii sankhya sattar-sattar na hokar kramshah 92 or 93 he
 It has been concluded that the original number of the Jatakas or the saga of the Jatakas will be the same as the number of the title of Nipat
 or baad main uskaa sanvardhan kiya gaya he
 So some of the saga is more ancient and some is relatively less ancient
 isi prakaar gadhy bhaag bhi kuch atyant pracheenta ke lakshan liye hue he or kuch apekshaakrit arvachin he
 There is no resemblance between prose and saga part in some people and there is a lot of variation in the style anywhere
 is sabase jataka ke sankalanaatmak rup or uske bhashaaroop kii vividhta par prakaash padataa he jisamen kai rachayitaaon yaa sankalankartaaon or kai shatabdiyon kaa yoga rahaa he
 The antiquity of the Jataka stories is undeniable, most of its prose is also very ancient
 bharhut or sanchi ke stupon kii pashaan veshtoniyon par jo chitra ankit he ve jataka ke gadhy bhaag se hi sambandhit hai
 Therefore, most of the prose part of Jataka which is ancient, in the third, second century BCE must be so popular that it can be made the basis of craftsmanship
 atah saamanytah ham jataka ko buddhakalin bhartiya samaaj or samskruti kaa pratik maan sakate hai
 Some of the signs and stages depicted in it are also from prague-buddhist India and some are from the post-buddha era
 jahaan tak gaathaon kii vyakhya or unke shabdaarth kaa samb ndh he, vah sambhavtah jataka kaa sab se adhik arvachin ansh he
 The author of this excerpt is considered Acharya Buddha Ghosh
 ‘gandhavans’ ke anusaar acharya buddhaghosh ne hi ‘jatakatthannana’ kii rachana kii, kintu yah sandigdh he
 While showing a variation of language style and giving some other prohibitive reasons, Dr
 T
 W
 Royce Davids does not consider Buddhaghosha to be the author or compiler of the Jatakattavavana
 swayan jatakatthakatha ke upodghaat main lekhak ne apana parichay dete hue kaha he ‘‘ xxrep 4 
 shantchitt pandit buddhamitt bhikshu buddhadev ke kehane se xxrep 8 
 vyakhya karunga
 The Mahishasak sect was a Buddhist sect unlike the Mahavihara tradition
 buddhaghosh ne jitani atthakathaayen likhi he, shuddh mahaviharavasi bhikshuon kii upadesh vidhi par aadhaarit hai
 Therefore, it is not right to associate the author of the scripture with Acharya Buddhaghosh
 sambhavtah yah koi anya sinhalai bhikshu the, jinka kaal paanchavin shatabdi isvi mana ja saktaa he
 It contains the following stories: tripitak The Jataka tales relate to the past births of Lord Buddha
 bodhisattva kii charyaaon kaa unamem varnan he
 So, they are all usually didactic
 parantu unka saahitiyik rup bhi nikharaa hua he
 Despite being didactic, he is artistic in its entire sense
 jataka ke aadi main nidaan-katha he, jisame bhagavan buddha ke pehle 24 budhon ke vivaran ke saath-saath bhagwaan gautam buddha kii jeevani letvan vihaar ke daan kii sweekruti tak di gai he
 The summary of some Jataka tales and the form of their subject matter is as follows

 The plot of the natives is of various types
 vinternitj ne mukhyatah saat bhaagon main unka vargeekaran kiya he- The styles of description also vary
 vinternitj ne inkaa vargeekaran paanch bhaagon main is prakaar kiya he

 These stories are very important
 visheshtah inhen kathaon kaa gaman videshon main hua he
 The cast of satire is also seen here in its poetic form
 praayah pashuon kii tulana main manushyon ko hin dikhaaya gaya he
 One special thing is that satire has been done on the entire caste and not on any person
 ek bandar kuch dinon ke liye manushyon ke bich aakar rahaa
 Later turns to his teammates
 saathi poochhate he-‘‘manushyon ke samaaj main rahe he
 They know their behavior
 hamen bhi kahen
 We want to hear that

 Say, we want to listen

 He hurts all the people
 ‘‘ bandar kah hi rahaa tha ki uske saathiyon ne kaan band kar liye‘‘ mat kahen mat kahen‘‘
 Many pictures of this kind of melodious and unique satire will be found in the native

 Similarly, in Setuketu Jataka there is mention of Uddālaka's son तुvetuketu to go to Taxila to study arts
 shatapath brahman ke uddalak ko ham uttarapath main bhraman karte hue dekhte he

 There are 2400 verses in the present form of Ramayana
 ramayana main kaha bhi gaya he ‘chaturvinsh sahatrani shlokanam ukt van rishih

 Therefore, Brahmadatta who came among the natives is not synonymous with only one time
