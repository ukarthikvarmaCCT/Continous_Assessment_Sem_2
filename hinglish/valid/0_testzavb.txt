 Since tax is paid only when the asset is sold, taxpayers can legally evade tax by retaining their assets - a concept known as the "lock-in effect"

 Yashovarman II was the ruler of the Chandel dynasty who ruled the Jejkabhuti region for a short period
 sandhi shabd kaa arth he 'mail'
 The disorder that occurs between two adjacent characters is called Sandhi
 jaise - sam + tosh = santosh ; dev + indra = devendra ; bhanu + udai = bhaanuday
 There are three types of treaties - do swaron ke mail se hone vaale vikaar ko swar-sandhi kehete hai
 Such as - Vidya + Alaya = School
 swar-sandhi paanch prakaar kii hoti hai - sutra-ak: Savarna Long: That is, when the Savarna comes after a pratyahar, both of them become long
 hrasv yaa deergh a, i, u ke baad yadi hrasv yaa deergh a, i, u aa jaaen to donon milakar deergh aa, i or uu ho jate hai
 like - a / aa + a / aa = aa Treaty of e and e u or uu kii sandhi It consists of A, a before E, e then A; If there is O, o is o and if there is R, it becomes Ar
 ise gun-sandhi kehete hai
 like - a + i = e ; nar + indra = narendra a + u = O; Wisdom + sermon = sermon; a + ri = ar dev + rishi = devarshi Aa + r = Ar Maha + Rishi = Maharishi a, aa kaa e, i se mail hone par i tathaa a, aa kaa o, ou se mail hone par ou ho jaataa he
 This is called growth pact
 jaise - a + a = Ai; a + a = acac; a + o = ou van + aushadhi = vanaushadhi ; aa + o = ou maha + aushadhi = mahaushadhi ; If there is an exogenous vowel in front of E, E, e becomes 'Y'
 u, uu ke aage kisi vijaateey swar ke aane par u uu ko ‘v’ ho jaataa he
 When a foreign vowel comes in front of 'R', r becomes 'R'
 inhen yan-sandhi kehete hai
 e + a = or + A; River + Arpan = Removal u + e = v + e ; anu + eshan = anveshan Any vowel beyond A, Ai and Ou becomes Ay, Ay, Av and Av respectively
 ise ayaadi sandhi kehete hai
 a + a = Ay + A; Ne + un = nayan i + a = aay + a ; gai + ak = gayak o + a = av + a; Po + Un = Wind ou + a = aav + a ; pau + ak = paavak Au + e = Av + E; Nine + iq = sailor vyanjan kaa vyanjan se athwa kisi swar se mail hone par jo parivartan hota he use vyanjan sandhi kehete hai
 like-sharat + Chandra = Sharachandra
 ujjwal If the first letter of a square, ch, t, t, p matches the third or fourth letter of a class or is a word, l, l, v, or a vowel, then k is called g, t is d
 And p becomes ble
 jaise - If the first letter of a class matches the letter n or m then it becomes the fifth character of the same class
 jaise - If the word combines with c, d, d, d, b, b, y, r, or or any vowel, it becomes d
 jaise - Beyond T, it becomes l when it is or is not J, i get j or J, i get t or i get T, Dr or i get d and l is taken
 jaise - If t combines with Sch, then t becomes ch and ch becomes ch
 jaise - If t combines with h then t becomes d and h is D
 jaise - If the six letters come after the vowel, then the six letters before the six are increased
 jaise - If there is a consonant from k to m after M, then m changes to Anuswara
 jaise - After M, m becomes dual
 jaise - m is a reminder after a dish containing any of the words y, y, l, l, v, sh,,, st, h
 jaise - R, र, becomes n beyond N
 parantu chavarg, tavarg, tavarg, sha or sa kaa vyavdhaan ho jane par n kaa n nahin hota
 like - s se pehle a, aa se bhinn koi swar aa jaae to s ko sha ho jaataa he
 like - visarg ke baad swar yaa vyanjan aane par visarg main jo vikaar hota he use visarg-sandhi kehete hai
 Like- manah + favorable = manokool visarg ke pehle yadi ‘a’ or baad main bhi ‘a’ athwa virgon ke tisare, chauthe paanchaven varna, athwa ya, r, l, va ho to visarg kaa o ho jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle a, aa ko chhodkar koi swar ho or baad main koi swar ho, varg ke tisare, chauthe, paanchaven varna athwa y, r, l, va, ha main se koi ho to visarg kaa r yaa r ho jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle koi swar ho or baad main c, chha yaa sha ho to visarg kaa sha ho jaataa he
 like - visarg ke baad yadi t yaa sa ho to visarg s ban jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle i, u or baad main k, kha, t, tha, pa, pha main se koi varna ho to visarg kaa sha ho jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle a, aa ho or baad main koi bhinn swar ho to visarg kaa lop ho jaataa he
 like - visarg ke baad k, kha athwa pa, pha hone par visarg main koi parivartan nahin hota
 like - chitiprolu krishnamurthi telugu bhashaa ke vikhyath sahityakar hai
 He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2008 for Purushottamudu, a collection of poems composed by him
 firoz shah tululaq dilli sultanate main tululaq vansh kaa shaasha tha
 Ferozeshah Tughlaq was born on 1309
 wo bharat par antim muslim shaasha tha
 He ruled from 1351 to 1388
 wo, dipalpur kii hidun rajkumaari kaa putr tha
 He forced many Hindus to adopt Muslim religion during his rule
 usne apane shasankaal main hi chaandi ke sikke chalaaye| firozshah tululaq, mohammad tululaq kaa chachera bhai evam sipahsalaar 'rajab' kaa putr tha
 His mother 'bibi Jaizella' was the daughter of Rajput chieftain Rajamal
 mohammad tululaq kii mutyu ke baad 20 march 1351 ko firoz tululaq kaa rajbhishak thatta ke nikat hua
 Feroze was crowned again in Delhi in August, 1351
 sultan banane ke baad firozshah tululaq ne sabhi qarze maaf kar die, jisamen 'sondhar rin' bhi shaamil tha, jo mohammad tululaq ke samay kisaanon ko diya gaya tha
 After becoming Sultan, Feroze Tughlaq invaded Bengal and Sindh as part of his campaign to conquer his territories separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal ko jeetne ke liye sultan ne 1353 i
 main akraman kiya
 At that time, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah was the ruler of that place
 usne ikdala ke qile main sharan le rakhi thi, sultan firoz antatah qile par adhikaar karne main asafal hokar 1355 i
 main waapas dilli aa gaya
 Again in 1359 AD, Firuz Tughlaq attacked Sikandar Shah, the son of the then ruler Shamsuddin, in an attempt to take control of Bengal, but failed once again
 1360 i main sultan firoz ne ‘jajanagar’ par akraman karke vahaan ke shaasha bhanudev tritiy ko parrast kar puri ke jagannatha mandir puri ko dhwast kiya
 In 1361 AD, Feroze attacked Nagarkot
 yahan ke jambabaniyon se ladati hui sultan kii sena lagbhag 6 maheene tak ran ke registan main fasi rahi, kaalaantar main jambabaniyon ne sultan kii adheenta ko sweekaar kar liya or vaarshik kar dene ke liye sahamat ho gayi
 Apart from these simple victories, there has been no major success in the name of Feroze
 usne dakshin main swatantra hue rajya vijaynagar, bahamani evam madura ko punah jeetne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Thus it can be said that Sultan Firuz Tughlaq did not undertake any military campaign during his reign for the expansion of the empire and whatever campaign he did, only to save the empire
 rajasav vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne apane shashan kaal main 24 kshtdaayak karon ko samaapt kar diya or keval 4 kar ‘karaaj’, ‘khums’, ‘jazia’, evam 'zakaat' ko vasuul karne kaa aadesh diya
 On the orders of the Ulama, the Sultan also imposed a new irrigation tax, which charged 1 / 10 of the produce
 sambhavtah firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal main lagaan upaj kaa 1 / 5 se 1 / 3 bhaag hota tha
 To facilitate irrigation, the Sultan built 5 big canals from the Yamuna River to Hisar, 150 miles long from the Sutlej River to the Ghaggar River, from the hill of Sirmour to the Hansi, from Ghaggar to Firozabad and from Yamuna to Firozabad
 usne falo ke lagbhag 1200 baag lagavaaye
 Abolished many taxes to increase internal trade
 nagar evam saarvajanik nirmaan kaaryon ke antargat sultan ne lagbhag 300 naye nagaron kii sthapana kii
 Among these, Hisar, Firozabad, Fatehabad, Jaunpur, Firozpur etc
 were prominent
 in nagaron main yamuna nadi ke kinare basaaya gaya firozabad sultan ko sarvaadhik priy tha
 The foundation of Jaunpur city was laid by Firoz in memory of his cousin 'fakhruddin Jauna'
 uske shashan kaal main khijrabad evam meerut se ashok ke do stambhalekhon ko laakar dilli main sthapit kiya gaya
 Under his welfare works, Firoz set up an employment office and a new department called diwan-e-khairat to help Muslim orphans, widows and girls
 'daarul-shafa' naamak ek rajkeey aspataal kaa nirmaan karavaaya, jisamen garibon kaa muft ilaaj hota tha
 During the reign of Firoz, the number of slaves reached about 1,80,000
 inaki dekhbhaal hetu sultan de 'dewan-e-bandaraan' kii sthapana kii
 Some slaves were sent to the provinces and the rest were kept in the center
 daason ko nakad vetan yaa bhukhand die gayi
 Slaves were also given handcraft training
 sainya vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne sainikon punah jaagir ke rup main vetan dena prarambh kar diya
 He made military posts hereditary, affecting the ability of soldiers to check
 khums kaa 4 / 5 bhaag phir se sainikon ko dene ke aadesh die gayi
 After some time his terrible result came to light
 firoz tululaq ko kuch itihaaskaar dharmandh evam ashishnu shaasha maanate hai
 Probably he was the first Sultan of Delhi Sultanate, who followed strict Islamic rules and gave importance to the Ulema class in administrative work
 nyaay vyavastha par punah dharmaguruon kaa prabhaav sthapit ho gaya
 Mukti used to explain the laws
 musalmaan aparaadhiyon ko mrityu dand dena band kar diya gaya
 Feroze was a staunch Sunni Muslim
 usne hindu janata ko ‘jimmy’ kaha or hindu brahmanon par jazia kar lagaaya
 Dr
 R
C
 Majumdar has stated that, "firuz was the most fanatical of this era and the Sinkadar Lodi and Aurangzeb in this region was outgoing
 ’ dilli sultanate main pratham baar firoz tululaq ne brahmanon se bhi jazia liya
 In the field of education, Sultan Firoz established many tombs and madrasas
 usne 'jiyauddin barani' evam 'shams-e-siraaj afif' ko apana sangrakshan pradaan kiya
 Barani composed 'fatwa-e-jahandari' and 'date-e-firozshahi'
 firoz ne apni aatmakatha ‘phutuhat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kii jabaki ‘sirat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kisi agyaat viddhan dwaara kii gai he
 Firoz translated some of the 1300 texts looted from the library of the Jwalamukhi temple under the name 'dalaiyte-firozshahi' by Eduddin
 'valaile-firozshahi' ayurveda se sambandhit granth tha
 He invented the water clock
 firoz kaal main khan-i-jahaan telgani ke makbara kii tulana jerusalem main nirmit umr ke maszid se kii jaati he
 Sultan Firoz Tughlaq built Kotla Feroz Shah Durg in Delhi
 apane bhai jona khaan kii smriti main jonpur naamak shahar basaaya
 Sultan Ferozeshah Tughlaq himself encouraged bribery in the administration
 afif ke anusaar-sultan ne ek ghudsavaar ko apane khazaane se ek taka diya, taaki vah rishwat dekar arj main apane ghode ko paas karvaa saken
 Firoz Tuglaq was the first ruler of the Sultanate who got the details of the man of the state
 khwaja hisamuddin ke ek anumaan ke anusaar- firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal kii vaarshik aay 6 karod 75 lakh takaad Firoz Tughlaq issued a large number of coins made of a mixture of copper and silver under the currency system, which were probably called 'adha' and 'egypt'
 firoz tululaq ne ‘shanshgani’ kaa nayaa sikaa chalavaaya tha
 He inscribed the name of his son or successor 'fatah Khan' with his name on the coins
 firoz ne apane ko caliph kaa nib pukaara tathaa sikkon par caliph kaa naam ankit karavaaya
 The rule of Ferozeshah Tughlaq was based on welfare autocracy
 vah pratham sultan tha, jisne vijayon tathaa yudhon kii tulana main apni praja kii bhautik unnati ko shreshth sthaan diya, shaasha ke kartavyon kaa vistrut kiya tathaa islam dharm ko rajya shashan kaa aadhaar banaaya

 Einstein wrote more than fifty papers and books apart from science
 1999 main time patrika ne shatabdi-purush ghoshit kiya
 According to a survey, he was considered the greatest scientist of all time
 oinstin ne 300 se adhik vaigyanik shodh-patron kaa prakaashan kiya
 On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the display of over 30,000 unique documents and papers from Einstein
 oinstin ke bauddhik uplabdhiyon or apurvata ne "oinstin" shabd ko "budhimaan" kaa paryaay bana diya he
 Albert Einstein was born in Germany into a Jewish family in Wüttemberg
 unke pita ek ejeeniyar or celsman the
 His mother was Pauline Einstein
 haalaanki oinstin ko shuru-shuru main bolne main kathinaayee hoti thi, lekin ve padhai main awwal the
 His mother tongue was German and later he also learned Italian and English
 1880 main unka parivaar munich shahar chalaa gaya, jahaan unke pita or chachaa ne milakar "electratechnic frabik je oinstin and si" naam kii company kholi, joki bijli ke upkaran banaati thi
 And it also provided lights for the first time at the Oktoberfest fair in Munich

 He learned to play Sarangi at the behest of his mother
 unhen ye pasand nahin tha or baad me ise chhod bhi diya, lekin baad me unhe mozart ke sarangi sangeet me bahut anand aata tha
 In 1894, his father's company could not get a contract to supply for electric lighting in the city of Munich
 jiske kaaran huye nuksaan se unhen apni company bechni pad gai
 In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, where they first settled in Milan and then a few months later in the city of Pavia
 parivaar ke pavia jane ke baad bhi oinstin munich main hi apni padhai puri karne ke liye ruke rahen
 In late December 1894, he traveled to Italy to visit his family in Pavia
 italy main apane samay ke dauraan unhone "ek chumbakeey kshetra main ether kii avasthaa kii jaanch" sheershak ke saath ek laghu niabandh likhaa tha
 Throughout his lifetime, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles
 unhone 300 se adhik vaigyanik or 150 gaiyr-vaigyanik shodh-patr prakashit kiye
 In his 1965 lecture, Oppenheimer noted that Einstein's early writings had many errors that caused his publication to be delayed by nearly ten years: "a man whose errors took a long time to correct, how much Would be great "
 ve khud ke kaam ke alaava duusare vaigyanikon ke saath bhi sahyog karte the, jiname bose oinstin ke aankade, oinstin refricrator or anya kai aadi shaamil hai

 These four articles have contributed greatly to the foundation of modern physics and changed the thinking of people on space, time and matter
 ye chaar kagajaat hai: In 1900, Einstein's first research paper was on "capillary attraction", presented to Onlen der Physik
 yah 1901 main " "keshikatv ghatana se nishkarsh" sheershak ke saath prakashit kiya gaya
 Two papers published in 1902–1903 attempted to explain atomic phenomena through statistical means
 yahi patr, 1905 ke brounian gati par shodh-patr ke liye neenv bane, jisamen pataa chalaa ki anuo kii upasthiti hetu brounian gati ko thos saboot kii tarah upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena
 unhone saapekshata ke siddhant ko vyakt kiya
 Which, according to Herman Minkowski, is known for the generalization of alternation alternately from space to space-time
 anya siddhant jo oinstin dwaara banaaye gaye or baad main sahi sabit hue, main samanta ke siddhant or kwantum sankhya ke samoshna samanyikaran ke siddhant shaamil the
 Einstein's paper "on the dynamics of electricity of moving bodies" was completed on 30 June 1905 and published on 26 September of the same year
 yah bijli or chumbakatv ke maxwell ke sameekaran or yantriki ke siddhanth, prakaash kii gati ke kareeb yantriki main bade badlaav ke baad, ke bich saamanjasy nishchit karata hai

 jiskaa nishkarsh tha ki, samay- antariksh dhaanche main gatisheel padaarth, dhimaa or sankuchit najar aata hai, jab ise paryvekshak ke dhaanche main mapa jaataa he
 This paper also argued that the idea of luminiferous ether was excessive
 dravyaman-urja samatulyata ke apane shodh-patr main, oinstin ne vishesh saapekshata samikarnon se E=mc2 ko nirmit kiya
 Since 1905 Einstein's research in relativity remained controversial for many years, although it was also accepted by many leading physicists such as Max Planck
 1905 ke ek patr main, oinstin bataaya kii ki prakaash swatah hi sthaneey kanon ke bane hote hai
 Einstein's light quanta hypothesis was rejected by almost all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Burr
 robert millican kii prakashavidyut prabhaav par vistrut prayog, tathaa compton bikharane kii maap ke saath, yah pariklpana saarvbhaumik rup se 1919 main sweekaar kar liya gaya
 Einstein concludes that each wave of frequency is associated with a collection of photons of energy
 unhone is bare main or adhik nahin bataaya, kyonki ve aashwast nahin the kii kaise kan, laharo se sambandhit hai
 But he suggested that this hypothesis could be explained by some experimental results, which were later specifically called the photoelectric effect
 1907 main, oinstin ne ek model prastaavit kiya, kii prayek parmaanu, ek jaali sanrachana main swatantra anuroop rup se dolan karata he
 In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently
 Einstein knew that real oscillations have different frequencies but still proposed this theory, because it was a clear demonstration of how quantum mechanics, in conventional mechanics, is associated with specific heat
 Can solve the problem
 peter dibai ne is model ko parishkrut kiya
 During the 1910s, it expanded to bring individual systems within the realm of quantum mechanics

 According to this theory- albert oinstin kaa is vishay main bahut bada yogadan rahaa he
 While traveling, Einstein wrote letters to his wife Elsa and adopted daughter Kadamuni Margot and Ilse
 ye patr, da hebrew uniwarsity main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Margot Einstein had allowed these private letters to be made available to the public, but at the same time requested that they not be done until twenty years after his death

 In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historic black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree
 oinstin ne america main naslwad ke bare main bhaashan diya, unka kahana tha, "meraa iske bare main chup rahane kaa koi iraadaa nahin hai
 "A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had ever paid college education fees for black students
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh se purv, ek akhbaar ne apane ek kollam main ek sankshipt vivaran prakashit kiya kii oinstin ko america main itani acchhee tarah se janaa jaataa tha ki log unhen sadak par roak kar unke die siddhant kii vyakhya poochne lagate the
 Eventually he figured out a way to avoid this constant questioning
 ve unase kehete kii "maaf kijiye! mujhe log aksar professor oinstin samajhate hai par wo main nahin hoon
 "einstein has been the subject or inspiration of many novels, films, plays and musicals

 Frederick Golden of Time magazine once wrote that Einstein was "like a cartoonist's dream coming true"
 oinstin ne kai puraskaar or sammaan praapt kiye or 1922 main unhen bhautikee main "saidhantik bhautikee ke liye apni sevaaon, or visheshkar prakashvaidhut prabhaav kii khoj ke liye" nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 If no nomination in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, then the award of 1921 went ahead and Einstein was awarded it in 1922

 satraap yaa kshatrap pracheen iran ke midi samrajya or hakhaamani samrajya ke praanton ke rajyapalon ko kaha jaataa tha
 The term was also used by the later Sasani and Greek empires
 aadhunik yug main kisi badi shakti ke neeche kaam karne vaale netaa ko kabhi-kabhi anaupchaarik rup se 'satraap' kaha jaataa he
 The area under a satrap was called a satrapi
 'satraap' shabd avastai bhashaa or pracheen farsi bhashaa ke 'kshabarapavan' shabd se aayaa he
 In this word 'khashthra' is similar to the Sanskrit homogeneous word 'kshetra'
 'paavan' shabd kaa arth pracheen farsi main 'raksha karne vaala' hota he, jo sanskrit ke 'paalan' shabd se or 'paavan' shabd donon se miltaa he
 'khatthrapavan' changed over time - 'khatthar' became 'city' and 'holy' became 'ban' or simply 'pa'
 is se yah shabd 'satraap' ke rup main or 'shaharbaan' ke rup main miltaa he, jiskaa sanskrit main 'kshetrapal' barabari kaa shabd hota
 In ancient Persian, a similar title 'shoitharapati' is also found, whose Sanskrit translation 'kshetrapati' is simple and the same title is used for Chhatrapati Shivaji
 'kshatrap' pracheen kaal main faras ke samraaton dwaara prantiy shaskaon ke liye diya hua naam 
 'shakhadrapan' of Hebrew is also used in the same sense
 iskaa arth 'pradesh kaa rakshak' hota he
 Greek writers - Herradotus, Thucydidze, and Xenophon, in the records of the countries of Babylon, Egypt, have interpreted it as a lieutenant governor
 herodotas ke anusaar kurush ke mahaan ne apane samrajya ko anek praanton main vibhakt kiya; darayavush ne unka ek nishchit dhang se sanghathan kiya tathaa apane puure samrajya main 21 kshatrap praanton kaa nirmaan kiya or unka kar bhi nishchit kiya
 The first task of the satraps and satraps was to collect the land of their provinces
 kshatrap is kar main se rajkeey sena, nyaayadhishon tathaa apane vyaktigat vyayon ko nikaalkar avshisht bhaag samraat ko detaa tha
 If the satrap wanted to be a benefactor of the emperor, he would have increased the amount of the emperor's share
 kshatrapon kii or se samraat ke liye koi nishchit rakam nahin bandhi hoti thi
 The State Kayastha used to keep an account of all the income and monitor the monarch's share
 unheen ko samrat kii ore se rajkeey aadesh praapt hua karte the
 Thus, the command given was expected to be obeyed at the earliest
 isamen tanik bhi avrodh vidroh samaj liya jaataa tha
 The satraps were also punished for this
 or turki samrajya kii bhanti unke dand main koi aupchaarikta nahin barti jaati thi
 There used to be a person at a distance of a day's journey for the method of commanding the emperor to the satraps
 ek duusare ke paas, doosraa tisare ke paas, is prakaar kshatrapon tak sandesh pahunchaaya jaataa tha
 The emperors of Persia also had other means to obtain subjugation of satraps
 a commissioner was sent with the patronage of the army to provide or punish according to the atmosphere and necessity
 xenofan ke anusaar yah pratha samrajya ke aarambh se hi chali aa rahi thi or uske samay bhi prachlit thi
 The emperor himself used to visit every territory of the empire every year to supervise the work of the satraps
 yadi vah swayan nahin ja paata to apane kisi pratinidhi ko bhej detaa tha
 In the province of Kshatrapas, on making special efforts for the fertility of the land or the promotion of agriculture, some other provinces would be provided to them, but where this order was not obtained, the state was cut off and merged with other Kshatrapan provinces
 praanton main prashasan ke vidhaan kaa bhaar samrat par hota tha jo apane bhai, kisi kutumbi athwa damaad ko kshatrap niyukt karata tha
 In India, Nahapan kept his son-in-law Ushwadat a satrap
 samrat ke saath bahuda nikat sambandh ke kaaran kshatrapon ke jivan main samrat kii hi bhanti vilasita parilakshith hoti thi
 Even in the court of Kshatrapas, formalities were carried out like an emperor
 samrat kii bhanti hi kshatrapon kaa apana antpur hota tha
 Antapur used to have a sufficient number of cleaves
 rajkeey sena ke atirikt kshatrapon kii vyaktigat sena hua karti thi
 Like the emperors, their palaces also had gardens, pramadavan, etc
 samraaton kii hi bhanti ve bhi varsh ke katipay mahinnon main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par samay vyateet karne ke liye jate the
 The Kshatrapas thus had more state power automatically
 sainya tathaa anya shaktiyon ke adhishthata hone ke atirikt ek or bhi baat thi jiske kaaran kshatrap atyant shaktishaalee ho jate the or unke vidroh karne kii ashanka bani rahati thi
 Sometimes they revolted
 kabhi do yaa adhik kshatrap praanton kaa adhishthata ek hi kshatrap bana diya jaataa tha jise mahakshatrap kehete the
 They had more military power and state power which helped in their rebellion
 iskaa udhaaharan daranvush ke rajyakaal main hi praapt he
 The Aroclies, who were the satraps of both Fijia and Lydia, revolted during the reign of the later rulers, especially in minor Asia, as the revolt of satraps began to increase
 laghu kurush ke kaal se kshatrapon kii is pravriti main nirantar vruddhi hoti gai
 The Kshatrapas sometimes revolted openly and declared themselves independent rulers
 in vidrohi kshatrapon main se bahuton ne kai rajyavanshon kii sthapana kii or baad main bilkul swatantra ho gaye
 In spite of all this, the emperor was successful in obtaining his subjection
 iskaa pramukh kaaran kshatrapon main parsparik kalah or yuddh tha
 Apart from this, due to the excesses of women in the court and the atmosphere of adultery, there was a comfortable loosening in the personality of the satraps
 kshatrap apane ko praanton ke raksharth niyukt nahin samajhate the balki unpar apana aadhipaty samajhate the
 One reason for this was also that the system of astral administration was also partly genetic
 ve kshatrap praanton ke bhoomikar tathaa anya aayon kaa upbhog karte the
 At the time of Xenophon, a satrap of Egypt was also appointed by the people of that region and they used to make arrangements instead
 yahi vyavastha uski mrityu ke pashchaat uski vidhwaa ke liye bhi hoti rahi
 Such a system easily loosened the structure of the empire
 parvarti kaal main kshatrapon ko rajkeey sena ke sanchaalan kaa bhi adhikaar mil gaya tha, visheshkar tab jab vah rajkeey parivaar kaa athwa uskaa koi sambandhi hota tha
 The little man was the satrap of Egypt, Fyzia, and Lydia, but he was also the commander of the entire army in the war
 yahi sthiti farnbesus tathaa anya kshatrapon kii bhi he, kintu iskaa arth yah nahin he ki kshatrap praanton main sainik shashan ho gaya tha
 In fact, the emperor used to appoint both soldiers and officers of the society himself
 magistriton kii niyukti bhi vah swayan karata tha
 The satrap could not interfere with the work of magistrates
 kshatrapeey prashasan kii vyavastha ko sikandar tathaa uske uttaradhikariyon ne bhi apanaaya tha, visheshkar silyuks ke samrajya main yaheen vyavastha thi
 The states of Shakas which were established in India also had a regional state system
 bhartiya kshatrapon ke teen pramukh vansh or ek rajvansh tha- The Kshatrapas of Kapisha, Pushpur and Abhisar are found from the records found there
 maanikyala abhilekh main granvahrayak ke putr kisi kshatrap kaa ullekh miltaa he
 He is said to be the satrap of Kapisha
 83wein varsh ke kabul sangrahalay abhilekh main pushppur ke tiravharn naamak ek kshatrap kaa ullekh he
 The name of Kshatrap Sivasena derives from a copper ring shaped posture obtained from the Abhinarprastha
 punjab ke kshatrap teen vanshon se sambandh rakhte hai - Kshatrapas of Mathura - The first of this dynasty was Rajuvul or Ranjuvul, who probably also ruled the first Sakal
 stencono ne us vansh kaa is prakaar anumaan kiya he: The name of Rajuvul is found in inscriptions and postures
 mora crup abhilekh main use mahakshatrap kaha gaya he
 But in the article on his postures, he has been called 'rajadhiraj'
 rajuvul kaa uttaradhikari shuds tha
 Even in the records, he has been called Mahakshatrap
 inke abhilekhon main diye gaye varshon ko kuch vidvan shaq or kuch vikram samvath main maanate hai
 The means of resolving these differences have not yet been found
 cono ke anusaar kharoshth rajuvul kaa shvasur tathaa palit ke anusaar, dauhitr tha
 On another currency, 'kshatrapas Prakhar Oshtas Artasputras' is found in the Kharoshthi script
 in kshatrapon ke muldesh ke sambandh main vidwaanon main matbhed he
 Sometimes he is said to have come from Palhava, sometimes from the country of doubt
 sambhavat ve shaq the
 Through coming through Persia, he became familiar with and associated with the system of Kshatriya; Apart from these, the currency of two Kshatrapas named Hagan and Hagamash have also been obtained from Mathura
 jo rajuvul vansh ke pashchaat mathura ke shaasha anumaan kiye jate hai
 On some coins the combined names of both are also found, and on some only the Hagamash
 inke pashchaat mathura main do-teen kshatrap or hue jinke naam bhartiya hai
 Perhaps by this time, these foreigners had fully embraced Indianness
 ujjain ke kshatrap - ujjain ke kshatrapon ko 'pashchimi bharat ke kshatrap' ke naam se bhi pukaarte he
 These satrapes appear to be of two lineages
 pehla vansh bhumak or nahpaan kaa tha tathaa doosraa chashton kaa
 Bhupak's successor Nahapan is not only traced to his silver and copper beads but also from the records of his son-in-law Ushavadat
 nahpaan ne pashchimi bharat ke kuch bhaag par bhi rajya kiya tha
 He also conquered some part of the Satavahana kingdom
 iske vansh ko shaharaat kehete he
 Rudradaman i ended the Shehrat dynasty
 girnaar abhilekh main use khakhraat vasanivases karas kaha gaya he
 Among the Kshatrapas of the second dynasty, who ruled in Ujjain, the name of Yasmotik, the father of Kardamak dynasty, comes first
 chashton kaa putr jaydaaman kshatrap tha kintu sambhavat vah pita ke jeevankaal main hi mar gaya or ujjain par chashton tathaa rudradaaman ne sammilit rup se shashan kiya
 In the Junagadh inscription it is said that in connection with Mahakshatrap Rudradamon, he had earned the title of Mahakshatrap
 prathit hota he ki uske vansh kii rajyashri sambhavat gautamiputra satkarni ne chin lee thi or rudradaaman ko mahakshatrap kii oopaadhi punah un pradeshon ko jitkar kerani arjeet kerani padi
 The Junagadh inscription praises his victories and his personality
 rudradaaman pratham kaa uttaradhikari uskaa jyeshtha putr damaghasad hua
 After him, the son of Damaghasad, Jeevadaman and his brother Rudrasinh succeeded him first
 isi rudrasingh ke samay aabhiron ne pashchimi kshatrapon ke rajya kaa kuch bhaag hadap liya tha
 Rudrasinh i was succeeded by his three sons Rudrasen I, Sanghadaman and Damasen

 His son Vishwesen became his satrap from the time of Bhartradaman
 bhartrudaman tathaa vishwasingh kaa sambandh mahakshatrap rudradaaman dwitiya se kya tha
 This cannot be said with certainty
 is vansh kaa antim kshatrap rudrasingh tritiy hua jisane lagbhag 388 i

 Chandragupta II of the Gupta dynasty, Vikramaditya, ended the Kshatrapas of Ujjaini and merged his kingdom with his empire and emulated his coins

 The WWF alleged that Warrier threatened to not do any shows until his former performance at wrestlemania was paid to him

 dablyoodablyooef ne kaha ki wariar ke jane kaa kaaran "niyam ulanghan" tha jise ek yadrichhik dawa pareekshan ke dauraan apane system main paaya gaya tha
 The dispute was largely due to Warrier's ongoing marketing / financial differences with Vince mcmahon

 Warrier claimed that his test results showed that he did not use steroids during this period

 Kesamuti Sutta or Kalam Sutta is a part of the sermon of Lord Buddha located in the Angussaada body of Tippitaka
 buddha dharm ke therwaad or mahayan sampradaay ke log praayah iskaa ullekh buddha ke 'mukt chintan' ke samarthan ke ek pramaan ke rup main karte hai
 Names in other languages of Kesamuttisutt are as follows- vishwa sahitya main pali sahitya kaa vishesh sthaan he
 Almost all the languages of the world have been influenced and fostered by this language and its large literature
 katha, darshan tathaa bauddhik sahitya ke vikaas main to iskaa atyant mahatvapurn sthaan he
 This literature has been playing an important role in the development of moral and idealistic literature all over the world for centuries
 pali bhashaa main tatkaaleen itihaas, darshan, samskruti tathaa paramparaon kaa vistrut va pramanik varnan praapt hota hi he, kintu apni vaigyanik, pramaan-sammat, kalyankari tathaa maanviya shikshaaon ke liye yah sahitya vishwa main vishesh shraddha-sthaan he
 Pali literature is very large and extensive
 isamen praapt hone vaale buddha-vachanon ko mukhyatah teen bhaagon main sankalit kiya gaya, jo is prakaar vibhakt he- vinay pitak, sutt pitak or abhidhamm pitak
 In vinaya-pitaka, the rules of ethics of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis have been compiled
 sutt-pitak main bhagwaan buddha ke dwaara updisht shikshaayen pramukhtah sankalit kii gai hai
 Reviews of philosophical elements have been collected in the abhidhamma-pitaka
 chunki sutt-pitak main bhagwaan buddha tathaa unke pramukh shishyon ke upadesh upvarnit kiye gayi hai
 For this reason, this Pitaka is very important for the worshipers
 sutt-pitak main atyant saral va subodh style main sundar upamaaon tathaa rupakon ke madhyam se aadhyatmik tathaa bhautik jivan ko sukhpurvak jeene kii kala buddha-dharm parampara ke anusaar sikhaai gai he
 sutta-pitaka is available in five parts
 in paanchon bhaagon main angutar-nikaay apane vaishishty ke kaaran vishesh sthaan rakhata he
 The specialty of Angusak-navy is that in this order of numbers from 1 to 11, sermons of Lord Buddha have been collected on the basis of digits
 prayek ank kii sankhya ek adhyay yaa nipaat he, jo ankavaar vishyon kaa pratipaadan karata he
 Therefore, the chapter is known by the noun nipit
 yah jaananaa rochak hi hoga ki ek ank se ekak-nipaat main dhamm kii ek sankhya kii drushti se vyakhya kii gai
 That is, religion has been considered from one point of view in each unit
 duk-nipaat main us par do-do, tik-nipaat main teen-teen tathaa chatukk-nipaat main chaar-chaar drushtiyon se varnan praapt hota he
 In this way, religion has been explained in eleven-eleven types till ekadasak-nipat respectively
 ekak-nipaat se ankon main vruddhi hote hue duk-tik-chatukk-panchak-chakk-sattak-atthak-nav-dasak-ekadask is prakaar kram se ankottar vruddhi chalati he
 Therefore, this name 'angusadnikaya' seems to be completely meaningful and appropriate
 angutar shabd main ang kaa arth ank hi he
 When the answer of these digits is in the meaning, the word Angusva is proved
 kramshah ankon kaa gananaa kii disha main uttar hi yahan abhipret he
 In this way, the name Angusakya Nikaya is meaningful and appropriate
 angutar nikaay ke kesamutti sutt main jis prakaar se vaigyanik chetana tathaa bauddhikta ko jaagrit karne tathaa andhvishwaason tathaa ghisi-pity baton nakaarne kii baat kii gai he, vah apane aap main ek misaal he
 Two and a half thousand years ago, Lord Buddha was such a great scientist and lecturer, who embodied such modern, scientific and fresh thinking method
 dhai hajaar varshon purv buddha ne itani vaigyanik baaten kah di, jo aaj bhi vigyaan ko raah dikhaa sakati he
 It is certainly a criterion for the science of science
 angutar nikaay ke kesamutti sutt main kalaamon ko sambodhit karke bataaya gaya gyaan sampoorn sahitya-vaanmay main vishisht sthaan rakhata he
 In fact, due to the scientific approach of this Sutta, Buddhist literature and the tradition of Buddhist knowledge gained prestige
 pali bhashaa main kesamuti sutt adhik bada nahin he, kintu iskaa atyant mahatva he
 It has been described that Lord Buddha, along with his huge Bhikkhusangh, arrived in the corporation of Kalaam called Kes-mutt while doing charika in Kosala district
 kalam log bhagwaan buddha ke suyash ko purv main bhi ‘itipi so bhagava arhan sammasambuddho vijzacharansmpanno sugto lokvidu anuttaro purisdhammasarathi sattha devamanussanan buddho bhagavati’ is rup main acchhee tarah se jaanate the
 So they reached him to see Lord Buddha
 unke paas jaakar kalaamon ne apni jigyaasa jaahir karte hue poocha ki ‘he bhante! vufach shraman-brahman cese-mutt nigam aate hai
 Here, they praise their own views and condemn others 'opinions and degrade others' opinions
 punah duusare shraman-brahman yahan aakar apane mat kii prashansa karke dusron ke maton kii ninda karte hue nahin thakte
 '1 bhagavan buddha ke samaksh is prakaar apni baat ko upasthaapit karne ke pashchaat unhone bhagwaan se prashn kiya ki ‘he bhante! apane mat kii prashansa tathaa dusron ke mat kaa dooshan karne se hamaare man main unke prati shankaa paidaa hoti he ki in shraman-brahmanon main kisne satya kaha he tathaa kisne jhooth?’ Then, while quelling the doubts of the Kalamas, the great scientist and psychiatrist, Lord Buddha, presents the test of truth to them and says, 'O Kalamo! It is ok to doubt sandeh karnaa thik he
 Actually, doubt has arisen instead of doubt
 ’ Hey Kalamon! One should not consider a fact only because it has been practiced by tradition, or has been said since ancient times, or it has been said in the scriptures, or the eclipse of this fact is appropriate for the resolution of a suit
 aakaar yaa gurutv ke kaaran hi kisi tathy ko sweekaar nahin karnaa chahie, pratyut isliye grahan karnaa chahie ki ye dharm hai, anindaneey hai tathaa isko grahan karne par iskaa fal sukhad or hitprad hi hoga
 2 kesamutti sutt main kahin gai ye baaten kitni vaigyanik, vivekmay tathaa ashapurna he
 Due to the above subject, scientific thinking led to the beginning of great revolution
 buddha ke pashchaadvarti chintakon ne is vishay par bahut dhyaan diya
 This Sutta is the unique basis of the scientific thinking of Buddhism and Dhamma
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki kisi bhi baat ko, chaahe vah parampara se hi kyon na chali aa rahi hon, maatr parampara ke naam par use bina kisi vivek ke nahin maan lenaa chahie
 Over the centuries, a lot of futile rhetoric and evils have come up in the name of tradition, it is not intelligence to consider these evils without question
 isi prakaar yadi bahut pracheen kaal se bhi kisi vishay ko kaha jaataa rahaa ho yaa paramparaagat rup main vah baat chali aa rahi ho, tab bhi use bina sanshodhan jaisaa kaa taisa sweekaar kar lenaa uchit nahin
 Those subjects should be considered independently about the good and the bad
 adolf hitler ke vishay main prasiddh he ki vah apane anucharon se kaha karata tha ki ‘kisi bhi jhooth ko baar baar dauraane se vah bhi sach lagane lagata he
 Often this tradition also plays the same role
 kitni bhi buree parampara ho yaa kitna bhi neech chalan ho, kintu use maanate-maanate vah hi sahi lagane lagati he
 The same seems appropriate when repeated again and again
 atah bahut kaal se maani jane vaali tathaa suni-sunai baton par aankh mundakar vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie
 Even if something is written in a sacred book, it should not be accepted without discretion
 chaahe kisi bhi dharm-granth yaa pustak main koi vishay kyon na likhaa gaya ho, us par bhi vivekpurna chintan aavashyak hota he
 Many such unhelpful, inhuman and hateful subjects are also filled in many religious texts, books considered sacred and Puranas
 inamen vivarnit sabhi vishyon par vaigyanik drushtikon se paricharchaa tathaa vimarsh hona chahie tathaa vigyaanvaadee bahes bhi jaruri he
 One should not believe them only by having the words of a religious teacher or a person of attractive personality
 sadiyon se kai pakhand dharmaguruon ne buree paramparaon tathaa apana laabh hone vaale panth chalaaye hai
