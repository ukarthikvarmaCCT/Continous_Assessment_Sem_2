 vah ben-har ko iske bare main bataati he, lekin use shant nahin kar paati kyonki mesala ke kaaran nahin-roman shashan ke kaaran- uskaa parivaar durbhaagya kii ore chalaa jaataa he, isliye ben-har apni viraasat or naagarikta donon ko khaarij kar detaa he or samrajya ke khilaaf hinsa kii yojana banaata he
 Knowing that the arrow is dying, ben-harr and Esther take him to see Jesus Christ, but they are not able to get close to him, with Pilate stepping back from his responsibilities for the fate of Christ
 The hearing has started

 He tells Esther, since he has heard the forgiving of Jesus Christ on the cross, that, "his voice is snatching my sword out of my hands" The film is about the empty cross of the sacrificial spot and the crowd of a religious and his disciples

 1995 kii ek documentry da celluloid closset ke liye ek saakshaatkaar main, patakatha lekhak gore vidal bal purvak kehete hai ki unhone vyler par yah dabaav daalaa ki vah stephen vid ko mesala or ben har ke bich ek apratyaksh samalangik samvaad banane ke liye nirdeshit kare
 vidal kehete hai ki ve ben-har kaa apane sahakarmi yahudiyon ke naam ek roman adhikari ko bataane se inkaar karne ko lekar mesala kii charam pratikriya kii vyakhya main madad karnaa chaahate the or unhone vyler ko suzav diya ki mesala or ben-har bachapan se hi samalangik premi rahe the, lekin ben-har kii baad main ruchi khatm ho gai, is tarah mesala kii pratihinsaatmakataa ko uski asweekruti ke anubhav se prerit bataaya jaataa
 chunki hollywood kaa production code isaki ijaajat nahin detaa, is vichaar ko abhinaytaon dwaara dhvanit kiya janaa tha or vidal ne vyler ko suzav diya ki ve stephen vid ko usee tarah se bhoomika nibhaane kaa nirdesh den, lekin heston ko yah na bataaen

 The next problem was that the hulls were too long, so they were also cut, however, because of this they looked fake, because the hulls were too easy to move, so weights were placed at their ends
 filmakan ke dauraan nideshak vyler ne dekha ki ek atirikt kalakaar kaa haath nahin he
 He had a fake hand of a man with a fake blood and a fake bone emerging from it, all of which was done to give the scene a real look when the vessel hit

 The ship's scene included Arias' constant command, "battle speed, hortator 


 attack speed 


 hitting speed!" " shabd hortator kaa ab istemaal nahin hota he or yah ullekhneey rup se adhiktar shabdkoshon main anupasthit he
 It was a Latin word, in relation to a ship, meaning "chief of the boatman", or "one who commands the boatman" and probably has its origin in the Latin verb horter
 aadesh " takaraane kii gati, hortator!" jise vyapak taur par yaad kiya jaataa he, nakal kii jaati he, kabhi nahin hua
 The ship scene is entirely fictional, as the Roman navy, unlike its early modern contemporaries, did not employ captives as ship slaves

 At the start of the chariot race, Heston shook the bridle and nothing happened; Four horses named after the stars, Aldebaran, Altair, Antarez and Ringel remained stable
 ant main bane hue set ke raste ke sheersh par kisi ne chillaaya, "giddi ap!" ghodon ne karrwai main garjana kii or heston uchhalkar laharaate hue rath ke peeche ja gira
 Three puppets were placed at the main points of the race to give the scene a more impressive and realistic look, with three people running with the chariot

 Under the inspiration of Professor Millikan, Andersen began his experiments according to a well-organized plan

 By measuring the curvature of these path lines, Andersen unquestionably proved in 1932 that when the energy of space rays transforms into matter, an electron is produced as well as another particle of the same positive amount, called 'pazitron'
 Name is given
 pazitron kaa bhaar thik electron ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 In 1936, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of Pazitran

 Gandharva Vivah is one of the eight forms of marriage that were accepted by the ancient Indian monuments
 is vivaah main var-vadhoo ko apane abhibhavakon kii anumati lene kii zarurat nahin padati thi
 The marriage was considered to be complete only after the young woman agreed to the mutiny, after having done the havan with fire from the house of a sotriya
 ise aadhunik prem vivaah kaa pracheen rup bhi kah sakate hai
 After such a marriage, both the bride and groom could give their parents free information about their marriage as the marriage done by witnessing Agni could not be dissolved
 abhibhavak bhi is vivaah ko sweekaar kar lete the
 But this type of marriage was considered to be against caste-based pre-approval or 'lokbhavna', people considered the marriage done in hastily as a marriage

 ise sameekaran isaliye kaha jaataa he ki isamen samta chinh kaa prayog kiya jaataa he 
 Actors are written on the left side of the parity symbol and products are written on its right side
 sameekaran kaa adhaar yah he ki kisi rasinic abhikriya main bhaag lene vaale bhibhinn tatwon ke parmaanuon kii sankhya abhikriya ke uparant bhi aparivartit rahati he
 The first chemical reaction was represented in 1615 by Jean Begwin
 vibhinn prakaar kii abhikriyaaon main antar karne ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke sanket prayog kiye jate hai
 Balancing a chemical reaction means writing down the number of minimum integer molecules of the reactants and products so that the terms in the chemical reaction follow those rules in the equation as well
 udhaaharan ke liye nimnlikhit abhikriya ko dekhie- To balance this reaction means to find the minimum integer values of a, b, c, d, e so that for any element the number of all atoms in the right side and left side of the equation is the same
 a, b, c, d, e aadi gunankon kaa maan saral gananaa dwaara kiya ja saktaa he yaa kuch moolbhoot niyamon ko lagaakar kiya ja saktaa he
 But both methods take time
 is kaam ko vidhivat karne kii reeti he, yugapat sameekaran banaakar unhen hal karnaa
 To balance the above chemical reaction we form the following simultaneous equation- in samikarnon ko samajhnaa saral he
 There are 2a atoms of sodium in the left side of the above reaction and d atoms in the right side
 atah 2 a = d { \ displaystyle 2a=d} 
 Similarly one can understand other equations
 sameekaran banane ke baad ham dekhte hai ki agyaat raashiyon kii sankhya 5 he jabaki samikarnon kii sankhya keval 4
 This means that we can proceed by choosing the value of any unknown amount as we wish
 mana ham a = 2 { \ displaystyle a=2} rakh dete he to shesh agyaat raashiyon ke maan ye honge: d = 4 { \ displaystyle d=4}, e = 3 { \ displaystyle e=3}, c = 2 { \ displaystyle c=2} tathaa b = 5 { \ displaystyle b=5} 
 Incidentally, all these values are integers
 kintu yadi ham a = 1 { \ displaystyle a=1} lekar chale hote to anya agyaat raashiyon ke maan ye hote: d = 2 { \ displaystyle d=2}, e = 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle e=3 / 2}, c = 1 { \ displaystyle c=1} tathaa b = 5 / 2 { \ displaystyle b=5 / 2}, jinamein kai purnank nahin hai
 If all the values are multiplied by 2 then all will be integers
 isi tarah 4, 6, 8, 


 se guna karne par bhi hamen sabhi agyaat raashiyon ke maan purnank praapt honge kintu sameekaran ke gunankon kaa maan nunatam purnank hona behatar mana jaataa he

 is prakaar uparokt abhikriya kaa santulit rup yah hoga: north-south dialogue started in developed and developing countries to establish a new international economy
 parantu viksit rashtron ke apekshapurna va adiyal vyavhaar ke kaaran uttar-dakshin sahyog kii baar sire nahin chadh saki
 The debt burden on the developing countries continued to increase
 unhen praapt hone vaali adhiktar videshi sahaayta kaa hissaa byaaj ke bhugtan main hi kharch hone laga or antarrashtriya aarthik sambandh adhik bhedbhaavpurn va jatil hote gaye
 Developing countries began to feel that talking about north-south cooperation could not benefit their interests
 isliye unhen dakshin-dakshin sahyog kii hi baat kerani chahie
 Therefore, developing countries started finding the basis of cooperation in the poor and under-developed countries of the South
 isi se dakshin-dakshin samvaad yaa sahyog kaa naaraa buland hua
 After World War II, the word 'south' came to be used for developing countries
 1945 ke baad samast vishwa rajnatik shabdaawalee main do bhaagon - uttar tathaa dakshin main bant gaya
 All the imperial forces or developed countries in the north were rich
 'dakshin' main samrajyavaadee shoshan ke shikaar rahe garib desh the
 When these countries gained independence, they found themselves suffering from the problem of economic backwardness
 swatantra antarrashtriya sambandhon ke nirvahan main bhi aarthik sadhano kii kami inke aade ai
 In such a situation, in order to make international relations more relevant, he urged the countries of the North to adopt a liberal attitude towards the establishment of a new international economy and as a result efforts of north-south cooperation started
 lekin sakaaratmak parinaam na nikalne se vikasshil deshon ne viksit deshon ke saath sahyog kii bajaay aapasi sahyog kii shuruyaat kii
 For this, a process of mutual discussion began, ie the south-south dialogue was born
 iske kaaran vikasshil deshon main antarnirbharta ke prayaas tej hue
 The process of making developing countries self-reliant through the process of south-south dialogue and reducing their dependence on developed countries is known as south-south cooperation
 dakshin-dakshin sahyog ke parinamswaroop vikasshil deshon main ek nae yug kaa sutarapaat hua
 Under this, the process of technical exchange was speeded up

 Maharaja Surajmal was a visionary of the Bharatpur state]
 unke pita badan singh ne deeg ko sabase pehle apni rajdhani banaaya or baad main surajmal ne bharatpur shahar kii sthapana kii
 Surajmal attacked Fatehgarh of Khemkaran Sogaria in 1733 and conquered and laid the foundation of the city of Bharatpur here in 1743, which had been inhabited since 1753
 maharaja surajmal raajnneetikushal, doordarshee, sundar, sudaul or swasth the
 He also formed a friendship with Maharaja Jai singh of Jaipur
 21 sitambar 1743 ko jaisingh kii maut ho gai or uske turant baad uske beton ishwari singh or madhosingh main gaddi ke liye jhagada hua
 Maharaja Surajmal was in favor of elder son Ishwari Singh while Maharana Jagat Singh of Udaipur was in favor of Madhosingh
 baad main jahajpur main donon bhaiyon main yuddh hua or march 1747 main ishwari singh kii jeet hui
 a year later in May 1748, the Peshwas pressurized Ishwari Singh to hand over the four parganas to Madho Singh
 phir marathe, sisodiya, rathod vagaira saat raajaaon kii fujen madhosingh ke saath ho gai or ishwarisingh akelaa pad gayamai 1753 main maharaja surajmal ne firozshah kotla par kabja kar liya
 The Nawab of Delhi, Ghazi-ud-din, again incited the Marathas against Surajmal and then the Marathas surrounded the Kumher fort of Surajmal in Bharatpur district from January 1754 to May 1754
 marathe kile par kabja nahin par paae or us ladaai main malhaar raav kaa betaa khande raav holkar maaraa gaya
 The Marathas were determined to kill Surajmal, but the Empress Kishori made a treaty between the Marathas and Surajmal with the help of Scindia
 vendel ke anusaar jarjar mughal-satta kii isi kalavadhi main jat-shakti uttari bharat main prabal shakti ke rup main ubharkar saamne ai
 After the death of Sawai Jai Singh, Surajmal proved the superiority of jat-shakti by giving Vijayashree the weak but right side against the power of seven kings including Marathas and Rajputs in the succession war of 1748
 usee samay mughalon kaa koi bhi abhiyaan aisa nahin tha jisamen jat-shakti ko sahyog ke liye aamantrit na kiya gaya ho
 Wazir Safdarjung was completely dependent on the power of his friend Suraj Mal
 apdasth vajeer safadarajang ke shatru mirbakshi gajiuddin khan ke netritv main maratha-mughal-rajputon kii sammilit shakti san 1754 main surajmal ke chote kile kumher tak ko bhi nahin jeet pai
 Abdali, invited by Najibuddaula in 1757, could not destroy Surajmal's power through his inhuman massacre
 deshadrohi najeeb ne us samay vajeer gajiuddin khan or maraathon ke coup se bachane ke liye abdali ko hindustan par akraman karne ke liye san 1759 main punah aamantrit kiya tha
 Surajmal's staunch enemy, Wazir Ghaziuddin Khan, had also fled and surrendered to the Jats after the first defeat of the Marathas in the Battle of Bari Ghat before the last battle of Panipat
 vendel ke anusaar 'mughal ahankaar kii itani kathor or itani sateek paraajay isse pehle kabhi nahin hui thi'
 In fact, the proud and frightened monster of Mughal power had collapsed, the remnants of which were led by Maharaja Suraj Mal, away from luxury and kitsch, carnal, valiant, assistant to the weak, protector of refuge, Prajavatsal, symbol of hindu-muslim unity, nationalist Jat- Power was established
 baad main 1760 main sadashiv raav bhaau or surajmal main kuch baton par anban hui thi
 On seeing the Nabi Masjid of Mathura, Bhau said angrily - Surajmal ji, Mathura has been in your possession for so long, then how did you leave this mosque? Surajmal replied - If i had believed that i would be the ruler of this area for the rest of my life, i might have got this mosque demolished, but what is the use? Tomorrow Muslims will get our temples demolished and build mosques there, would you like it? Later, Bhau ordered the demolition of the roof of the Red Fort, thinking that he would sell his gold and pay his soldiers
 is par bhi surajmal ne use manaa kiya, yahaan tak kaha ki mere se paanch lakh rupee le lo, par ise mat todo, aakhir nadirshah ne bhi is chat ko baksh diya tha
 But Bhau did not agree - when the gold of the roof was broken, it hardly came out of three lakh rupees
 surajmal kii kai baton ko bhaau ne nahin mana or yah bhi kaha bataate hai - main itani dur dakshin se aapaki takat ke bharose par yahaan nahin aayaa hum
 On 14 January 1761, the third battle of Panipat took place between the Marathas and Ahmad Shah Abdali
 maraathon ke ek lakh sainikon main se aadhe se zyada maare gaye
 The Marathas neither had full ration nor did they have any distinction of this area, what would the war-hungry soldiers do for many days? If Sadashiv Rao did not quarrel with the small talk with Maharaja Suraj Mal and made him a partner in this war, today the picture of India would have been different
 Maharaja Surajmal still paid the friendship
 tees-chalis hajaar marathe jang ke baad jab waapas jane lage to surajmal ke ilaake main pahunchate-pahunchate unka bura haal ho gaya tha
 They were all on the verge of dying, in an injured condition, hungry and thirsty, and even died in a terrible winter from above, even half had no woolen clothes
 das din tak surajmal nen unhen bharatpur main rakkha, unki dawa-daaru karwaai or bhojan or kapade kaa intjaam kiya
 Maharani Kishori also appealed to the public and collected grains
 suna he ki koi bees lakh rupee unki seva-pani main kharch hue
 On going, one person was given one rupee, one cereal and some clothes etc
 so that he could take the cost of the road
 kuch marathe sainik ladaai se pehle apane parivaar ko bhi laae the or unhen haryana ke gaanvon main chhod gaye the
 His widows did not return to his death
 baad main ve parivaar haryana kii samskruti main ram gaye
 In Maharashtra, 'dange' is also said to be of Jat dynasty and 'dangi' is also their branch in Haryana

 Presently, the dominance of English journalism in Hindi journalism has been abolished
 pehle desh-videsh main angreji patrakarita kaa dabadabaa tha lekin aaj hindi bhashaa kaa jhandaa chanhudish laharaa rahaa he
 May 30 is celebrated as 'hindi Journalism Day'
 bharatvarsh main aadhunik dhang kii patrakarita kaa janm atharahavin shatabdi ke chaturth charan main kalakatta, bombai or madras main hua
 Hicke's "calcutta Gazette", published in 1780 AD, was perhaps the first attempt in this direction
 hindi ke pehle patr udant maartand ke prakashit hone tak in nagaron kii angloindian angreji patrakarita kaaphi viksit ho gai thi
 In these last years, journalism was also born in the Persian language
 18veen shatabdi ke farsi patr kadachit hastlikhit patr the
 In the compilation titled 'hindusthan Intelligence Oriental Anthology' published in 1801, there were quotes from how many "newspapers" in North India
 1810 main maulavee ikraam ali ne kalakatta se litho patr "hindostani" prakashit karnaa aarambh kiya
 In 1816 Gangakishore Bhattacharya introduced the "bengal Gazette"
 yah pehla bangala patr tha
 Later priests of Shrirampur gave birth to the famous propaganda "samachar Darpan"
 in praarambhik patron ke baad 1823 main hamen banglaa bhashaa ke 'samacharchandrika' or "samvaad kaumudi", farsi urdu ke "jaame jahannuma" or "shamsul akhbaar" tathaa gujarati ke "mumbai samachar" ke darshan hote hai
 It is clear that Hindi journalism is not much later
 dilli kaa "urdu akhbaar" or marathi kaa "digdarshan" hindi ke pehle patr "udant martand" ke baad hi aae
 The editor of "udant Martand" was Pandit Jugalkishore
 yah saptahik patr tha
 The language of the letter used to be Pachhihi Hindi, which the editors of the letter called "madhya Pradesh language"
 yah patr 1827 main band ho gaya
 In those days it was impossible to carry any letter without government assistance
 company sarkaar ne mishnariyon ke patr ko dak aadi kii suvidha de rakhi thi, parantu cheshtaa karne par bhi "udant martand" ko yah suvidha praapt nahin ho saki
 From 1826 AD to 1873 AD, we can call the first phase of Hindi journalism
 1873 i
 main bharatendu ne "harishchandra magazine" kii sthapana kii
 a year later the letter became famous as "harishchandra Chandrika"
 vaise bharatendu kaa "kavivachan sudhaa" patr 1867 main hi saamne aa gaya tha or usne patrakarita ke vikaas main mahatvapurn bhaag liya tha; parantu nai bhashastyli kaa pravartan 1873 main "harishchandra magazine" se hi hua
 Most of the letters in the meantime can only be called experiments and there is no knowledge of journalism behind them or the spirit of propagating new ideas
 "udant martand" ke baad pramukh patr hai : Some of these letters were monthly, some weekly
 dainik patr keval ek tha "samachar sudhavarshan" jo dwibhashiya tha or kalakatta se prakashit hota tha
 This daily paper continued till 1871
 adhikansh patr agra se prakashit hote the jo un dinon ek bada shikshacendre tha or vidhyaarthismaj kii aavashyaktaaon kii purti karte the
 The rest were related to Brahmasamaja, Sanatana Dharma and missionary work
 bahut se patr dwibhashiya the or kuch to panchabhaashiya tak the
 This also informs the immature condition of journalism
 hindipradesh ke praarambhik patron main "banaras akhbaar" kaaphi prabhaavshaalee tha or usee kii bhashaniti ke virodh main 1850 main taramohan maitra ne kaashi se saptahik "sudhakar" or 1855 main raja lakshmanasingh ne agra se "prajahitaishi" kaa prakaashan aarambh kiya tha
 When King Shivaprasad's "banaras Newspaper" adopted the Urdu language style, both these letters tended towards the Panditau Tasampradhan style
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki 1867 se pehle bhashastyli ke sambandh main hindi patrkaar kisi nishchit style kaa anusaran nahin kar sake the
 This year 'kavi Vedasudha' was published and in a way we can call it the first important letter
 pehle yah masik tha, phir pakshik hua or ant main saptahik
 Bhartendu's multiple personality was published through this paper, but the truth is that till the publication of "harishchandra Magazine", he too appears to find a path in the field of language and ideas
 hindi patrakarita kaa doosraa yug 1873 se 1900 tak chalata he
 At one end of this era was Bharatendu's "harishchandra Magazine" and "saraswati", approved by the Nagri Pracharini Sabha
 in 27 varshon main prakashit patron kii sankhya 300-350 se upar he or ye nagpur tak faile hue hai
 Most of the letters were monthly or weekly
 masik patron main niabandh, naval katha, vaarta aadi ke rup main kuch adhik sthaayee sampatti rahati thi, parantu adhikansh patr 10-15 prishthon se adhik nahin jate the or unhen ham aaj ke shabdon main "vichaarpatr" hi kah sakate hai
 News and commentaries also had an important place in the weekly papers
 vastav main dainik samachar ke prati us samay vishesh aagrah nahin tha or kadachit isiilie un dinon saptahik or masik patr kahin adhik mahatvapurn the
 He took a very important part in the public awakening
 unnisvin shatabdi ke in 25 varshon kaa adarsh bharatendu kii patrakarita thi
 Bharatavandu as "kavikavashasudha", "harishchandra Magazine", Sri Harishchandra Chandrika ", Balabodhini, pioneered this direction
 unki tikatippaniyon se adhikri tak ghabaraate the or "kavivachansudha" ke "panch" par rusht hokar kaashi ke magistrate ne bharatendu ke patron ko shiksha vibhaag ke liye lenaa bhi band kara diya tha
 There is no doubt that even in the field of journalism, Bharatendu was completely fearless and encouraged new letters
 "hindi pradeep", "bharatjivan" aadi anek patron kaa namakaran bhi unhone hi kiya tha
 All the journalists of his era considered him a pioneer
 bharatendu ke baad is kshetra main jo patrkaar aae unamem pramukh the pandit rudradutt sharma,, baalkrishna bhatta, durgaaprasad mishra, pandit sadanand mishra, pandit vanshidhar, badrinarayan choudhary "premadhan", devakinandan treepathi, radhacharan goswami, pandit gauridatt, raaj rampal singh, pratapanarayan mishra, ambikadutt vyas,, babu ramakrishna verma, pan

 is patrika se gambhir sahityasamiksha kaa aarambh hua or isliye ham ise ek nishchit prakashastambh maan sakate hai
 With the revision of "saraswati" and "sudarshan" in 1900 AD, this second era of Hindi journalism comes under fire
 in 25 varshon main hindi patrakarita anek dishaao main viksit hui
 Initial letters were limited to teaching and preaching
 bharatendu ne saamaajik, raajnneetik or saahitiyik dishaaen bhi viksit kin
 He was the first woman to run a monthly letter called "balabodhini"
 kuch varsh baad mahilaon ko swayan is kshetra main utarate dekhte hai - "bharatbhagini", "sugruhinee" 
 Aryasamaj and Sanatan Dharma preachers were particularly active in the field of religion in these years
 brahmsamaj or radhaswami mat se sambandhit kuch patr or mirzapur jaise isai kendron se kuch isai dharm sambandhi patr bhi saamne aate hai, parantu yug kii dharmik pratikriyaaon ko ham aryasamaj ke or puranikon ke patron main hi pate hai
 Today these letters may not seem so important, but there is no doubt that they reinforced the prose style of Hindi and also sparked new ideas in public
 in dharmik vadavivaadon ke falswaroop samaaj ke vibhinn varg or sampradaay sudhaar kii ore agrasar hue or bahut sheeghra hi sampradayik patron kii baadh aa gai
 Hundreds of different ethnic and class papers were published and he spoke to innumerable people
 aaj vahi patr hamaari itihaetana main vishesh mahatvapurn hai jinhone bhashaa style, sahitya athwa raajnneeti ke kshetra main koi apratim kaary kiya ho
 Literally "hindi Pradeep", Brahmin, Kshatriya Patrika, Anandakadambini, Bharatendu, Devanagari Preacher, Vaishnav Patrika, Poet painter, Nagari Neerad, Sahitya Sudhanidhi and politically Bharatamitra, proper speaker, Sara Sudhanidhi, Bharatodaya, India life, Bharatodaya, Well-wishers and Hindi Bangwasis are particularly important
 in patron main hamaare 19veen shatabdi ke sahityarsikon, hindi ke karmath upaskon, shaileekaron or chintakon kii sarvshereshth nidhi surakshit he
 It is a matter of anger that we could not save this important material from the files of letters
 baalkrishna bhatta, pratapanarayan mishra, sadaanan mishra, rudradutt sharma, ambikadutt vyas or balmukund gupt jaise sajiv lekhakon kii kalam se nikle hue na jane kitne niabandh, tippanee, lekh, panch, haas parihaas aup sketch aaj main hamen alabhya ho rahe hai
 Even today our journalists can learn a lot from them
 apane samay main to ve agrani the hi
 Twentieth-century journalism is relatively close to us, and much of the diversity and polymorphism of journalism is found in it
 19veen shatee ke patrakaron ko bhashaa-shailishetra main avyavashtha kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 He had to place his object in front of letters in English and Urdu on the other hand
 abhi hindi main ruchi rakhanevaali janata bahut choti thi
 Gradually the situation changed and we find Hindi papers leading in the field of literature and politics
 is shatabdi se dharm or samajasudhar ke andolan kuch peeche pad gaye or jaateey chetana ne dhire-dhire rashtriya chetana kaa rup grahan kar liya
 As a result, most of the papers went with literature and politics
 saahitiyik patron ke kshetra main pehle do dashakon main acharya dvivedi dwaara sampadit "saraswati" kaa netritv rahaa
 In fact, in these twenty years, the monthly letters of Hindi emerged as a great literary force
 shrunkhalit upanyaas kahani ke rup main kai patr prakashit hue - jaise upanyaas 1901, hindi navil 1901, upanyaas lahari 1902, upanyasasagar 1903, upanyaas kusumanjali 1904, upanyasbahar 1907, upanyaas prachaar 19012
 Many letters began to come out in the last years of the nineteenth century with only poetry or problematics
 ve chale rahe
 Publication of "critic" and "history" related to historical research are also important events in the field of criticism
 parantu saraswati ne "mislani" ke rup main jo adarsh rakhaa tha, vah adhik lokapriy rahaa or is shrenee ke patron main uske saath kuch thode hi patron kaa naam liya ja saktaa he, jaise "bharatendu", nagari hitaishini patrika, bankipur, nagariprachaarak, mithilamihir or indu 
 Both "saraswati" and "indu" are important for the history of Hindi literature and in a way we can call them the apex of literary journalism of that era
 "saraswati" ke madhyam se acharya mahaviraprasad dvivedi or "indu" ke madhyam se pandit rupanarayan pandeya ne jis sampadakeey satarkta, adhyavsaay or eemaandaaree kaa adarsh hamaare saamne rakhaa vah hindi patrakarita ko ek nai disha dene main samarth hua
 But Hindi journalism could not get leadership in political field
 pichley yug kii raajnneetik patrakarita kaa centre kalakatta tha
 But Calcutta used to stay away from Hindi region and Hindi state itself got a conscious leadership in political direction in a short time
 hindi pradesh kaa pehla dainik raja rampalasinh kaa dwibhashiya "hindustan" he jo angreji or hindi main kalaakankar se prakashit hota tha
 Two years later, Babu Sitaram started extracting a daily letter called "bharatodaya" from Kanpur
 parantu ye donon patr dirghajivi nahin ho sake or saptahik patron ko hi raajnneetik vichaardhaara kaa vaahan bananaa padaa
 In fact, in the nineteenth century, Bharat Mitra, Vangwasi, Sarasudhanidhi and proper speaker of Calcutta represented the royal spirit of the Hindi state
 inamen kadachit "bharatamitra" hi sabase adhik sthaayee or shaktishaalee tha
 In the nineteenth century, Bengal and Maharashtra were centers of folk awakening and these provinces were also pioneers in radical national journalism
 hindi pradesh ke patrakaron ne in praanton ke netritv ko sweekaar kar liya or bahut dinon tak unka swatantra raajnneetik vyaktitv viksit nahin ho sakaa
 Nevertheless, we find many advances in Hindi political journalism in the form of "abhyudaya", "pratap", "karmayogi", "hindi Kesari" etc
 pratham mahayuddh kii uttejnaa ne ek baar phir kai dainik patron ko janm diya
 "calcutta News", "swatantra" and "vishwamitra" were published from Calcutta, "venkateswara Samachar" from Bombay started publishing its daily edition and "vijay" came out from Delhi
 1921 main kaashi se "aaj" or kanpur se "vartmaan" prakashit hue
 Thus we see that in 1921 Hindi journalism once again takes turns and starts its new life in the political arena
 hamaare saahitiyik patron ke kshetra main bhi nai pravritiyon kaa aarambh isi samay se hota he
 As a result, the first twenty years of the twentieth century can be called the third phase of Hindi journalism
 1921 ke baad hindi patrakarita kaa samasamyik yug aarambh hota he
 In this era, we find national and literary consciousness flourishing together
 isi samay ke lagbhag hindi kaa pravesh vishvavidhyalayon main hua or kuch aise kriti sampadak saamne aae jo angreji kii patrakarita se purnat: parichit the or jo hindi patron ko angreji, marathi or banglaa ke patron ke samakaksh laana chaahate the
 As a result, a new era in literary journalism began
 rashtriya andolanon ne hindi kii rashtrabhasha ke liye yogyata pehali baar ghoshit kii ore jaise-jaise rashtriya andolanon kaa bal badhane laga, hindi ke patrkaar or patr adhik mahatv paane lage
 After 1921, the national movement under Gandhiji's leadership did not remain confined to the middle class and reached the villagers and workers, and in this spread Hindi journalism gave significant additions
 sach to yah he ki hindi patrkaar rashtriya andolanon kii agr pankti main the or unhone videshi satta se datakar morcha liya
 Many times the foreign government fudged the freedom of newspapers by enacting new laws, but in spite of jail, fines and many mental and economic difficulties, Hindi journalists lit the lamp of free thought
 1921 ke baad sahityakshetra main jo patr aae unamem pramukh hai- In fact, there can be no doubt in the maturity and diversity of our monthly literature
 hindi kii anekanek pratham shrenee kii rachanaayen masikon dwaara hi pehle prakaash main ai or anek shreshth kavi or sahityakar patrakarita se bhi sambandhit rahe
 Today, our monthly letters cover all the parts of life and literature and now attention is also being paid to expertise
 sahitya kii pravritiyon kii jaisi vikasman jhalak patron main milti he, waisi pustakon main nahin milti
 There we find an active, vigorous, dynamic form of literature
 raajnneetik kshetra main is yug main jin patrapatrikaon kii dhooma rahi ve hai - Most of them are weekly, but their contribution to the creation of public has been significant
 jahaan tak patr kala kaa sambandh he vahaan tak ham spasht rup se kah sakate hai ki tisare or chauthe yug ke patron main dharti or akaash kaa antar he
 Today, editing is really high quality art
 raajnneetik patrakarita ke kshetra main "aaj" or uske sampadak swargeey baburao vishnu paradkar kaa lagbhag vahi sthaan he jo saahitiyik patrakarita ke kshetra main acharya mahaviraprasad dvivedi ko praapt he
 The truth is that "aaj" has done the work of a great institution in the field of journalism and it has given a number of editors and journalists to Hindi
 aadhunik sahitya ke anek angon kii bhanti hindi patrakarita bhi nai koti kii he or usamen bhi mukhyat: hamaare madhyavitt varg kii saamaajik, saanskrithik, saahitiyik ou raajnneetik hulchalon kaa pratibimb bhasvar he
 In fact, the true history of the last 200 years can only be compiled from our letter sheets
 banglaa ke "kaler katha" granth main patron ke avataranon ke aadhaar par bengal ke unnisvin shatabdi ke madhyavittiya jivan ke akalan kaa praytn hua he
 Such an effort is also desirable in Hindi
 ek tarah se unnisvin shatee main sahitya kahi ja sakanevaali cheez bahut kam he or jo he bhi, vah patron ke prishthon main hi pehle-pahal saamne ai he
 The contribution of letters has been very important in the formulation of linguistic style and the development of ethnic styles, but by the end of the first two decades of the twentieth century, only monthly letters and weekly letters have been giving birth to and developing our literary tendencies
 dvivedi yug ke sahitya ko ham "saraswati" or "indu" main jis prayogtmak rup main dekhte hai, vahi us sahitya kaa asli rup he
 After 1921 AD, literature started to stand on its own feet, independent of many leaflets, but for specific literary movements, we have to reverse the pages of the monthly papers
 raajnneetik chetana ke liye to patrapatrikas hai hi
 In fact, it is impossible to reach such a large population of pure literature as the number of journalists touches a large population
 90 ke dashak main bhartiya bhashaaon ke akhabaaron, hindi patrakarita ke kshetra main amar ujaalaa, dainik bhaskar, dainik jaagran aadi ke nagaron-kasbon se kai sanskaran nikalne shuru hue
 Where newspapers were first published from metros, new technology that came after globalization, better roads and access to traffic resources made it easier to print city editions even from small towns and towns
 saath hi in dashakon main gramin ilaakon, kasbon main failte bazaar main nayi vastuon ke liye naye upabhoktaaon kii talash bhi shuru hui
 Hindi newspapers have emerged as a means of dissemination of these items
 saath hi saath akhabaaron ke in sanskarnon main sthaneey khabaron ko pramukhataa se chapa jaataa he
 This has greatly increased the readership of newspapers
 media visheshgy sevanti ninaan ne ise 'hindi kii saarvajanik duniya kaa punarvishkaar' kaha he
 She writes, "print media has expanded the existing public world of Hindi at the district level by coverage of local events and also inadvertently reinvented it by local editions of newspapers
 1990 main rashtriya pathak surveykshan kii report bataati thi ki paanch aguva akhabaaron main hindi kaa keval ek samachar patr hua karata tha
 The past has proved how fast we are growing
 is baar sabase adhik padhe jane vaale paanch akhabaaron main shuru ke chaar hindi ke hai
 Another encouraging thing is that most of the 42 cities in the IRS survey which are considered to be the fastest emerging, are from the Hindi heartland
 matlab saaf he ki agar pichley teen dashak main dakshin ke rajyon ne vikaas kii jabardast pingen badhaain to aane vaale dashak ham hindi waalon ke hai
 It is not that in the case of newspaper studies, these regions are proving to be leaders
 iti industry kaa ek aankada bataata he ki hindi or bhartiya bhashaaon main net par padhane-likhane waalon kii taadaad lagaataar bad rahi he
 Meaning is clear
 hindi kii aakankshaon kaa yah vistaar patrakaron kii ore bhi dekh rahaa he
 With the consciousness of progress, people sitting in the bottom line of society should also appear in the rows of newspapers
 pichley iees, iaiti or tamaam shiksha parishadon ke parinaamon ne sabit kar diya he ki hindi bhashiyon main sabase nichali sidhiyon par baithe log bhi jabardast oochaal ke liye taiyaar hai
 Hindi journalists will have to go one step ahead of them to regain the place which we have lost continuously over the last four decades

 fatima sheikh ek bhartiya shikshika thi, jo saamaajik sudhaarkon, jyotiba phule or savitribai phule kii sahyogi thi
 Fatima Sheikh was the sister of Mian Usman Sheikh, whose house was inhabited by Jyotiba and Savitribai Phule when Phule's father expelled his family from their homes for their work for the upliftment of Dalits and women
 vah aadhunik bharat main sabh se pehali muslim mahila shikshakon main se ek thi or usne phule skool main dalit bacchon ko shikshit karnaa shuru kiya
 Jyotiba and Savitribai Phule, along with Fatima Sheikh, accused of spreading education in Dalit communities
 fatima sheikh or savitribai phule ne mahilaon or utpeedit jatiyon ke logon ko shiksha dena shuru kiya, sthaneey logon dwaara unhen dhamkee di gai
 Their families were also targeted and were given the option to stop all their activities or leave their homes
 They clearly opted for the latter

 Usman Sheikh offered the Phule duo their home and agreed to run a school on the campus
 1848 main, osman shaikh or uski bahan fatima shaikh ke ghar main ek skool kholaa gaya tha
 It was no surprise that almost all people from the upper caste of Poona were against Fatima and Savitribai Phule, and there was also an attempt to stop them due to social humiliation
 yah fatima shaikh tha jisane har sambhav tareeke se dridhtaa se samarthan kiya or savitribai ke samarthan kaa samarthan kiya

 In exchange for trading or exchange of the underlying asset itself, the derivative traders enter into an agreement to exchange cash or assets based on the underlying asset from time to time
 bhavi anubandh, iskaa ek saadhaaran udhaaharan he, jo ek aisa samjhauta he jiske aadhaar par kisi bhavi tithi main antarnihit parisampatti kaa vinimay kiya jaataa he
 Derivatives are often highly leveraged, so that even a small movement in the underlying price can cause a very large difference in the price of the derivative
 yadi antarnihit parisampatti ke keemat main thik vaisaa hi parivartan aata he jaisaa ki niveshkon kaa anumaan he to isamen hone vaale laabh kaa anumaan lagane or isse laabh kamaane ke liye niveshkon dwaara vyutpaadan kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Alternatively, traders can use derivatives to hedge or reduce the risk of the underlying asset, and for this they enter into a derivative contract whose price moves in the opposite direction to its underlying position and its Cancels some or all of the part
 vyutpaadan ko saamanytah vyapak rup se nimna dwaara vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: a derivative is a contract whose origins are derived from an underlying asset
 kai saamanyat upyog me aanevaale yantro ko derevatives kaha ja saktaa he kyonki, ve apana mul kisi sampatti se nikaalte he
 For example, equity shares are themselves derivatives because they derive from their underlying underlying equity
 isi prakaar koi apane ghar ke liye beemaa letaa he jisase wo ghar ke sabhi jokhim se bachaa sake
 Derivatives are based on all major financial instruments that are explicitly sold in equities, debt instruments, foreign exchange, etc
 is prakaar jab ham derevatives ke bare me baat karte he, to hamaara aksar matlab vittiya derevatives se hota he
 There are various types of derivatives like forwards, futures, options and swaps
 adhikansh derevatives over-da-counter yaa bombai stock exange ke rup me ek exange par khride-beche jate he
 Derivatives are one of the three major categories of financial instruments and the other two shares and debt

 derevatives upree upkarnon me se kisi ek kaa upjog karke yaa, do yaa do se adhik upkarnon kaa ek sangyojan kaa upyog karke upyogkartaaon kii vibhinn aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye is tarah se taiyaar kiya ja saktaa
 2
 Derivatives can be traded on the basis of expectations about the future price movements of the underlying assets
 3
 ve sabhi band balanceshit upkarnon he
 4
 They can be used as a tool to reduce the risk of fluctuations in asset values
 mahatvapurn vittiya derevatives is prakaar he:- 1
 Forwards 2
 futures 3
 Options 4
 swaps Forwards is the oldest and first of all derivatives
 ek forward anubandh do pakshon ke bich ek samjhauta par ek purv nirdhaarit keemat par bhavishya me ek nishchit tithi par nakadi ke liye ek parisampatti ke ek sahmati maatra kaa aadan pradaan karne ke liye sanderbhit karata he
 The promised asset can be currency, commodities, instruments, etc
 udhaaharan:-1 june ko x ek samajhote par kapaas kii 50 ganthe ko Y, ek kapaas vyapaaree se gathree prati 1000 rupaye ke str par 1 disambar ko kharidta he
 This is a contract where x pays Rs 5 xxrep 4 0 for y on 1 December and y sells 50 bales of cotton to X
 ek forward anubandh me, ek upyogkarta, jo ek nishchit bhavishya kii tarik me ek sahmati mulya par nirdisht sampatti kharidne ke liye vaada karata he wo ‘lambey sthiti’ me hona kaha jaataa he
 On the other hand, a user who promises to sell in a future date at an agreed price is said to be in a 'short position'
 futures anubandh yah he jaha kuch bhavishya kii taarikh me nakadi ke liye kisi bhi sampatti yaa mudra yaa vastu vinimay karne ke liye, ek sahmati mulya par do pakshon ke bich ek samjhauta hota he
 In order to make both contracts the parties must have mutual trust with each other
 yah keval sangathit bhavishya ke bazaar main jagah letaa he
 Types of Futures: - futures do prakaar main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 1
 Commodity Futures 2
 vittiya futures The option contract gives the buyer an option to ring the purchase or underlying asset at a predetermined price before or on a future date
 keemat jo purv nirdhaarit he use ‘hadtaal mulya’ yaa ‘vyaayaam keemat’ kaha jaataa he
 Type of option: - vikalp do prakaar main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 1
 Put Options 2
 dabl vikalp Put option: - This is an option that gives the option holder the right to sell an underlying asset at a pre-determined price before the due date
 dabl vikalp:- yah ek aisa vikalp he jisame vikalp dharak ko bhavishya me ek nirdhaarit tithi se pehle ek purv nirdhaarit mulya par ek anternihit parisampatti ko kharidne yaa bechney ke liye aadhikar detaa he
 Swap is the exchange of financial instruments of two parties through a derivative contract
 yah us baat ke liye bazaar yaa to mudra bazaar yaa byaaj dar bazaar main utaar chadhaav yaa kisi anya bazaar se utpann hone vaale laabh lene ke liye vyavastha kii he
 Avoidance is a technique designed to eliminate or reduce risk
 vyutpaadan ke madhyam se antarnihit parisampatti kii keemat se sambandhit jokhim ko ek paksh se duusare paksh ko hastantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, a farmer cultivating wheat and a milling farmer can sign a future contract to exchange a specified cash amount for a specified quantity of wheat in the future
 donon pakshon ne bhavi jokhim ko kam kar diya he: gehun kii kheti karne vaale kisaan ne keemat kii anischitata ke or miller ne gehun kii uplabdhta ke jokhim ko kam kar diya he
 However, there is still a risk because the events in the contract, such as the weather, are not fixed, which may cause wheat to be unavailable or that one of the parties may withdraw from the terms of the contract
 Although there is a third party called a clearing house to protect this future contract, not all derivatives are protected against counterparty risk
 duusare drushtikon se, kisaan or miller donon ek jokhim ko kam karte hai or ek jokhim kaa uparjan karte hai jab ve bhavi anubandh par hastakshar karte hai: kisaan is jokhim ko kam karata he ki gehun kii keemat anubandh main vinirdisht keemat se kam hoga or is jokhim kaa uparjan karata he ki gehun kii keemat anubandh main vinirdisht keemat se adhik hoga 
 duusari taraf, miller is jokhim kaa uparjan karata he ki gehun kii keemat anubandh main vinirdisht keemat se kam hoga or jokhim ko kam karata he ki gehun kii keemat anubandh main vinirdisht keemat se adhik hoga
 In this sense, one party is the insurer for one type of risk and the counterparty is the insurer for the other type of risk
 bachaav tab bhi hota he jab koi vyakti yaa sanstha ek parisampatti kharidta he or ek bhavi anubandh kaa prayog karke ise bechata he
 The person or entity has the right over this asset for a specified time and can then sell it at a specified price in future as per future contract
 beshak, isse vyakti yaa sanstha ko parisampatti ke adhikaar kaa laabh praapt hota he jabaki is baat kaa jokhim kam ho jaataa he ki bhavi vikray keemat apratyaashit rup se parisampatti ke bhavi keemat ke prati bazaar ke maujuuda keemtankan se vichlit hoga
 Derivation serves a legitimate business purpose
 udhaahranswaroop ek nigam ek vishesh byaaj dar par dhan kii ek badi rakam udhaar letaa he
 The loan interest rate is reset every six months
 nigam ko is baat kii chintaa he ki byaaj-dar chah maheenon main bahut adhik ho saktaa he
 The corporation may purchase a forward rate agreement
 agrasar dar samjhauta, paise kii ek kaalpanik raashi par kharidari karne ke baad chah maheenon tak ek nirdhaarit byaaj-dar ke bhugtan kaa ek anubandh he
 If after six months the interest rate exceeds the contracted rate, the seller, corporation or FRA pays the difference to the buyer
 yadi dar kam ho to nigam, vikreta ko is antar kaa bhugtan karegaa
 The purchase of FRA will serve to reduce uncertainty related to rate increase and keep earnings stable
 jokhim ko bimaakrit karne yaa usase bachaav karne kii apeksha jokhim kaa uparjan karne ke liye vyutpaadan kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus, some individuals and entities will enter into a derivative contract to bet on the price of the underlying asset and bet that the party seeking insurance about the future asset's future price will prove to be wrong
 sattebaaz, ek vyutpaadan anubandh ke anusaar kam keemat par bhavishya main ek parisampatti ko kharidne main samarth hona chahenge jab bhavi bazaar keemat adhik ho yaa ek vyutpaadan anubandh ke anusaar adhik keemat par bhavishya main ek parisampatti ko bechnaa chahenge jab bhavi bazaar keemat kam ho
 Individuals and institutions may also be exposed to arbitrage opportunities when the current purchase price of an asset is lower than the price specified in a future contract to sell the asset

 vyapak taur par kaha jaataa he ki vyutpaadan anubandhon ke do suspasht samooh hai jo bazaar main vyapaar kiye jane ke tareeke ke anusaar ek-duusare se bhinn hai: The main three classes of derivation are: in buniyadi prakaar ke tatwon ke sangyojan dwaara adhik jatil vyutpaadan kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the holder of a swaption has the right, and not the obligation, to enter the swap on or before a specified future date
 samgr vyutpaadan bazaar main antarnihit parisampatti ke paanch pramukh varg hai: Some common examples of these derivatives are: antarnihit vinimayogy ke anya udhaaharan hai: Payment between parties can be determined by: kuch vyutpaadan, ek purv-nirdhaarit keemat ke liye bhavishya main kisi samay antarnihit pratibhuti yaa camodity ko kharidne yaa bechney ke adhikaar hai
 If the price of the underlying security or commodity moves in the right direction, the owner of the derivative makes money, otherwise his money is lost or the derivative becomes worthless
 anubandh ke niyamon par nirbhar hone ke kaaran, ek vyutpaadan kaa sambhavit laabh yaa haani apekshaakrit adhik ho saktaa he jitna antarnihit pratibhuti yaa camodity ko pratyaksh rup se vyapaar main lagane par hota
 There are two common measurements of price: vinimay-vyapaar vyutpadanon ke liye bazaar keemat aamtaur par paardarshee hota he 
haalanki OTC yaa fler-vyapaar anubandhon ke saath jatiltaayen paidaa ho sakati hai kyonki vyapaar ko apane haathon se sambhala jaataa he jo keemton ke swatah prasaarit hone ke liye ise kathin bana detaa hai
 Especially with OTC contracts, there is no special exchange for mixing and disseminating prices
 ek vyutpaadan anubandh ke liye antarpanan-mukt keemat jatil hota he or is par vichaar karne ke liye isamen kai alag-alag parivartaneey hote hai
 Arbitrage-free pricing is a core subject of financial mathematics

 Derivatives can often face the following criticisms: vyutpaadan ke prayog ke parinamswaroop bahut badi haani kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he kyonki isamen uttolan yaa udhaar kaa prayog hota he
 With the help of derivatives, investors can get higher returns from the slightest movement in the price of the underlying asset
 haalanki, niveshkon ko bahut badi raashi kaa nuksaan bhi ho saktaa tha yadi antarnihit parisampatti kii keemat main unke khilaaf gati hota
 There are many examples of huge losses in derivatives markets, such as: vyutpaadan bazaaron ko viniyamit karne ke prayaas ko nasht karne or is tarah fol 2008 main vittiya bazaaron ke patan main sahaayak hone ke liye vittiya bazaar ke raashtrapati clinton ke karmi dal ke sadasyon: laire samars, alen greenspan, arthur leavit or robert rubin kii aalochana kii gai he
 President George W
 Bush has also been condemned because he was president for 8 years before the 2008 recession and did nothing to regulate derivative trade
 bush ne kaha he ki viniman, unke raajnneetik darshan ke mul siddhanton main se ek tha
 Derivatives expose investors to counterparty risk
 udhaahranswaroop, maane len ki ek vyakti apane vyavsaay ke liye ek nishchit byaaj dar par rin lenaa chahta he lekin jab use is baat kaa pataa chalata he ki bank keval parivartaneey daron par rin pradaan karte hai or kisi duusare vyavsaay kii sahaayta se gamagam bhugtan kii suvidha pradaan karte hai jiske liye ve avastavik rup se vyakti ke liye nishchit dar kaa nirmaan karte hai
 However, if the second business goes bankrupt, it cannot disclose its variable rate and therefore the first business will lose its fixed rate facility and start paying again at the variable rate
 yadi byaaj dar main vruddhi ho gai ho, to sambhav he ki pehla vyavsaay par pratikul prabhaav pad saktaa he kyonki ho saktaa he ki yah ucch parivartaneey dar ke bhugtan ke liye taiyaar na ho
 Different types of derivatives thus carry different levels of risk
 udhaahranswaroop, kaanoon ke nusaar manakikrut stock vikalp ke liye paksh ko jokhim uthaane ke liye exange ke saath kuch nishchit raashi jamaa kerani padati he jo yah darshata he ki ve kisi bhi haani kii sthiti main bhugtan kar sakate hai; jo bank rin par nishchit daron ke liye vyavsaay gamagam parivartaneey main madad karte hai, ve donon pakshon kaa credit check kar sakate hai
 However, private agreements established between two companies, for example, may not have criteria for performing loan enterprises and risk analysis
 vyutpaadan laghu yaa anubhavheen niveshkon ke liye anuchit atyadhik jokhim raashi khadaa kar dete hai
 Since derivatives offer more profit potential, they also provide an attraction for individual investors
 haalanki, vyutpaadan nihit sattebaazi main khaas taur par chote niveshak ke liye, aksar bahut adhik jokhim kii kalpana kii jaati he or jisamen anuroop anubhav or bazaar gyaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo is baat kaa kaaran he ki kyon kuch vittiya yojanakaar in prapatron ke prayog ke viruddh salaah dete hai
 Derivatives are complex forms created as a type of insurance that transfers risk between parties based on their desire to assume additional risk or avoidance
 vyutpaadan vyapak taur par ek arthvyavastha main rin kaa uttolan karte hai, antarnihit vaastavik arthvyavastha ko apane rin dayitvon kaa seva pradaan karne main or adhik pareshaan paidaa kar dete hai, is tarah vaastavik aarthik gatividhiyon main katautee kar dete hai jiske falswaroop mandi yaa yahaan tak ki niraashaa bhi ho sakati he

 SETI uses radio signals for this purpose
 iske alaava, optical doordarshee or anya vidhiyon ko prayog kiye jane kii bhi siforishein kii gai hai
 Sety is busy with her efforts and keeps searching for information about intellectual life on another planet
 vishwa kii shaktishaalee vedhashalaon or doordarshiyon kii madad se seti brahmad ke kone kone se aane vaale radio sampreshnon ko ekatrit kar unka vishleshan karti he
 As of now, we are alone in the universe as yet calculated
 antariksh main nirvaat hone ke kaaran vah apane aap main koi vishesh shaktishaalee radio sanketvahak nahin he
 According to the scientists at SETI, if an unknown civilization in remote space catches radio signals sent from Earth, it should leave the information in space in the north like we release information through radio and TV stations
 yadi antariksh main koi sabhyataa he to unke liye in sandeshon ko pakadana bhi acha-khaasaa chunauteepurn kaary hoga
 They believe that the way we have the capability and technology to deliver our messages to a distance of several million light years, the same technology can also be with the people of another planet
 jaise prithvi se radio, tivi, radar ke sanket nikalakar antariksh main failte hai vaise hi anya grahon ke radio sanket bhi antariksh main honge
 By catching these signs one can learn a lot about the other world
 seti dwaara ho rahe is adhyayan ko aarambh main america ne vittiya madad di lekin baad main ise band kar diya
 Many researchers at SETI also believe that to search for an outer civilization, we must be sent at a moderate frequency and any message sent out of the solar system must remain in one place in space
 iske liye seti ke khagolavidon ne vishalkay superkamputaron dwaara sandeshon ko scan karne kaa kaam kiya he, jiske baad antat:yah kaary ek vikendrikrut computing network, seti@home ko de diya gaya
 By the way, no signs of any other astronomical civilization have been revealed so far
 anek khagolavidon ke anusaar koi bhi bahari sabhyataa radio sandeshon kaa aadan-pradaan nahin karegi, chunki bahut sambhav he ki vah prithvi kii sabhyataa se kahin aage hogi
 Therefore astronomers are also searching for laser rays in space

 brahmi ek pracheen lipi he jisase kai asian lipiyon kaa vikaas hua he
 According to Devanagari, other South Asians, south-east Asians, Tibetans, and according to some, the Korean script was also developed from this
 ithiopian lipi par brahmi lipi kaa spasht prabhaav he
 Until now, the Brahmi script was believed to have been developed by the Mauryans in the fourth to third centuries BCE, but recent excavations from the Archaeological Survey of India have shown that it existed in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka since the 6th century BCE
 kai vidwaanon kaa mat he ki yah lipi pracheen saraswati lipi se nikali, atah yah purvavarti rup main bharat main pehle se prayog main thi
 After the removal of Saraswati script, Brahmi script came into vogue for writing Prakrit language
 brahmi lipi main sanskrit me zyada kuch aisa nahin likhaa gaya jo samay kii maar jhel sake
 Buddhist teachings of Mauryan Emperor Ashoka written in Prakrit / Pali language are still safe
 isi liye shaayad yah bhram upann hua ki is kaa vikaas mauryon ne kiya
 This script was written in the same way from left to right as the scripts of today
 lalitvistar main lipiyon ke jo naam ginaae gaye hai, unamem 'brahmalipi' kaa naam bhi mila he
 The earliest form of this script is found only in the inscriptions of Ashoka
 baudhon ke pracheen granth 'lalitvistar' main jo un 64 lipiyon ke naam ginaae gaye hai jo buddha ko sikhaai gai, unamem 'nagari lipi' naam nahin he, 'brahmi lipi' naam hai
 'lalitwistar' was translated into Chinese in AD 308
 jainon ke 'pannavna sutara' or 'samavayang sutara' main 18 lipiyon ke naam die hai jinamein pehla naam bambhi he
 His Bhagavatisutra begins with 'namo Bambhiye Libiyye'
 sabase pracheen lipi bharatvarsh main ashok kii pai jaati he jo sindh nadi ke paar ke pradeshon ko chhod bharatvarsh main sarvatra bahudhaa ek hi rup kii milti he
 The script which contains Ashoka's writings is the extracted Brahmi script of ancient Aryans or Brahmins
 jainon ke 'pragyapanaasutra' main likhaa he ki 'ardhamagadhi' bhashaa jis lipi main prakashit kii jaati he vah brahmi lipi he'
 Ardhamagadhi language is the language of the region between Mathura and Pataliputra from which Hindi originated
 atah brahmi lipi madhya aryaavart kii lipi he jisase kramshah us lipi kaa vikaas hua jo peeche 'nagari' kahalaai
 The present form of Nagari is clearly visible in the crooked Magadhi letters of the time of King Adityasena of Magadha
 isa kii 9veen or 10veen shatabdi se to nagari apane purna rup main lagati he
 How the Nagari alphabets are progressively transformed from the letters of the time of Ashoka, has been made clear by Pandit Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha in the book 'ancient Lipimala' and by a map
 kai paashchaatya vidwaanon kaa mat he ki ki bharatvasiyon ne akshar likhnaa videshiyon se siikhaa tathaa brahmilipi bhi usee prakaar pracheen phinician lipi se vyutpann hui he jis prakaar arabi, unani, roman aadi lipiyaan
 But many indigenous scholars have proven that the Brahmi script developed independently in India
 brahmi lipi se udgam hui kuch lipiyaan or unki akruti evam dhwani main samanthaayen spashtatya dekhi ja sakati hai
 Many of these scripts were developed around the time of Christ
 in main se kuch is prakaar hai- Here is a comparative picture of some Indian scripts: prasanti express 8464 bhartiya rail dwaara sanchalit ek mail express train he
 The train leaves from Bangalore City Junction railway station at 02:00 PM and arrives at Bhubaneswar railway station at 08:55 PM
 isaki yatra avadhi he 30 ghante 55 minute
 Rail is a means of transport in which passengers and goods are transported from one place to another on vehicles plying on the tracks
 parmparik rup se rail vaahanon ke neeche pahiyen hote hai jo ispaat kii bani do patariyon par santulit rup se chalate hai, lekin aadhunik kaal main chumbakeey prabhaav se patari ke upar latakkar chalane vaali 'maglev' or ek patari par chalane vaali 'monorol' jaisi vyavasthaayen bhi rail vyavastha main gini jaati hai
 Railroad vehicles are often long-chain cans connected to each other by one or more coal, diesel, electric, or other energy-driven engines
 is tarah se jude hue dabbon or injanon ko 'railgadee' yaa 'train' bulaayaa jaataa he
 Although the word 'rail' has entered almost all languages, yet in many languages local words have been coined for it
 dhyaan dijiye ki yah shabd koshon or sarkari dastavezon main to milten hai lekin aksar saamaanya prayog main nahin hai
 In many languages, words have been invented by taking the idea of rail as 'iron path' or 'vehicle traveling on iron path'
