 kisi kaksha main vibhinn tarah ke bachche hote hai jinaki apni-apni aavashyaktaayen ho sakati hai
 Like - some children write letters upside down, some have low hearing power, some have low intelligence
 sabhi bachche saamaanya gati se nahin sikh pate hai
 The pronunciation of some children is not clear due to which the development and daily functioning of these children are affected
 inhen bhinnataaon ke kaaran in bacchon ke paalan-poshan main kuch bhinn yaa vishisht tareeke apnaane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Special plans have to be made for their education, to ensure that their optimal development is promoted
 abhibhavakon or shikshakon ko in bacchon ko bolnaa sikhaane, chalane-phirane, mitra banane or ve kaushal or sankalpanaayen, jo saamaanya bachche vikaas ke dauraan sahaj rup se praapt kar lete hai, unhen arjeet karne or sikhaane ke liye vishesh prayaas karne hote hai
 These children have certain requirements that are different from the needs of most children, that is, they have some special needs
 kuch kshetron main spasht rup se drushtigat hone vaali vibhinnataaon ke baavjood, vishisht bachche kai prakaar se apni aayu ke saamaanya bacchon ke samaan hote hai
 Six areas are crucial for functioning normally
 ye hai - drushti, shravan shakti, gatishiltaa, sampreshan, saamaajik-bhaavnaatmak sambandh, budhimatta
 In addition, economically disadvantaged children are also special because they are deprived of many life experiences due to poverty

 Isolation in a separate classroom or special school for students with special needs: In this model, pupils with special needs do not attend classes with non-disabled students

 He was the king of Kannauj
 jayachand kaa rajbhishek visan 1226 asarh shukla 6 ko hua
 King Jayachand was a mighty ruler
 uski vishaal sainya vahini sadaiv vicharan karti rahati thi, isliye use ‘dal-pangul' bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is also praised in Prithviraj Raso
 rajasekhar suri ne apane prabandh-kosh main kaha he ki kashiraj jayachandra vijeta tha or ganga-yamuna doaab to uskaa vishesh rup se adhikrut pradesh tha
 Nayanchandra has called Jayachand in Rambhamanjari the destroyer of forests
 yupriy hone ke kaaran inhone apni sainya shakti aisi badhaai kii vah adwitiya ho gai, jisase jayachand ko dal pangul' kii oopaadhi se janaa jane laga
 It was only when he was crown prince that he defeated the Chandela king of Kalinjar, Madan Varma, with his might

 tarain ke yuddh main gauri ne prithviraj chouhaan ko parrast kar diya tha
 As a result of this, Muslims were dominated by Delhi and Ajmer
 yahan kaa shashan prabandh gauri ne apane mukhya senapati aibak ko saunp diya or swayan apane desh chalaa gaya tha
 After the Battle of Tarain, Muslims became a permanent state in India
 aibak gauri kaa pratinidhi banakar yahan se shashan chalaane laga
 Two years after this war, Gauri again came with a large army to conquer India
 is baar uskaa kannauj jeetne kaa iraadaa tha
 Kannauj was a prosperous state at that time
 gauri ne uttar bharat main apane vijit ilaake ko surakshit rakhane ke abhipraay se yah akraman kiya
 He knew that he could not maintain his power in India without subjugating the powerful Kannauj kingdom

 Sultan Shahabuddin joined the army of fifty thousand on the way

 The two fought at a place called 'chandavar' near Etawah
 yuddh main raja jayachand hathi par baithkar sena kaa sanchaalan karne laga
 Jayachand did not have an entire army in this war
 senaayen vibhinn kshetron main thi, jayachand ke paas us samay thodi si sena thi
 Unfortunately Jaichand's arrow hit him, leading to his death, Gauri won the battle
 yah yuddh visan 1250 ko hua tha
 Jaichand is charged with sedition
 kaha jaataa he ki usne prithviraj par akraman karne ke liye gauri ko bharat bulaayaa or use sainik sanhaayta bhi di
 In fact, these allegations are baseless
 aise koi pramaan nahin hai jisase pataa lage ki jayachand ne gauri kii sahaayta kii thi
 The other men who called Gauri were malevolent, whose names are mentioned in Prithviraj Raso
 sanyogita prakaran main prithviraj ke mukhya-mukhya samant kaam aa gaye the
 These people secretly informed Gauri that Prithviraj's chief feudal is no more, this is the chance
 tab bhi gauri ko vishwaas nahin hua, usne apane doot fakiron ke bhesh main dilli bheje
 These people stayed secretly with these people
 inhone jaakar gauri ko soochna di, tab jaakar gauri ne prithviraj par akraman kiya tha
 Nityanand Khatri, Pratapsingh Jain, Madhobhatta and Dharmayan Kayastha who were the poets and officials of the Tenvars
 samakaleen itihaas main kahi bhi jayachand ke bare main ullekh nahin he ki usne gauri kii sahaayta kii ho
 All these are fanciful things in modern history
 jayachand kaa prithviraj se koi vaimnasy nahin tha
 He was a bit annoyed by the incident
 us samay prithviraj, jayachand kii krupa se hi bachaa tha
 At the time of coincidence Haran, Jaichand had commanded his army to surround them
 lagaataar paanch din tak prithviraj ko dabaate rahe
 Prithviraj's main chief was employed in the feudal war
 paanchave din sena ne gheraa or kadaa kar diya
 Jaichand moves forward, he sees that Sankrita is sitting on the horse behind Prithviraj
 usne vichaar kiya ki sanyogita ne prithviraj kaa varan kiya he
 If i kill it, it will be a great disaster, the daughter will become a widow
 usne sena ko gheraa todane kaa aadesh diya, tab kahin jaakar prithviraj dilli pahunchaa
 Then Jaichand sent his priest to Delhi, where Prithviraj and Sanyogita married by law
 prithviraj or gauri ke yuddh main jayachand tatasth rahaa tha
 Prithviraj did not even ask for help in this war
 pehle yuddh main bhi sahaayta nahin maangi thi
 If Prithviraj asked for help, Jayachand could have helped
 agar jayachand or gauri main mitrataa hoti to baad main gauri jayachand par akraman kyon karata ? atah yah aarope mithyaa he
 Nowhere in Prithviraj Raso was it said that Jaichand had called Gauri
 isi prakaar samakaleen farsi granthon main bhi is baat kaa sanket tak nahin he ki jayachand ne gauri ko aamantrit kiya tha
 It is a heard and heard thing that has become a trend
 jayachand or itihaaskaaraitihaaskaar samraat jayachand ke liye itihaas kii paryaapt jaankaree ke abhaav main apshabd kahe jate hai jabaki khyatinaam itihaaskaaron kii samraat jayachand ke prati raay nimnanusaar he

 - Dr
 Ramshankar Tripathi yah dharna ki musalamaanon ko prithviraj par chadhaai karneke liye jayachand ne aamantrit kiya, niraadhaar he
 Certain texts of that time are attainable, but this is not mentioned in any of them
 prithviraj vijay, hamir mahakavy, rambha manjari, prabandh kosh va kisi bhi musalmaan yatri ke varnan main aisa ullekh nahin he
 History testifies that Jaichand fought a gallant war with Mohammad Gauri at Chandavar
 | - mahendra nath mishra It is absolutely untrue that Jaichand invited Shahabuddin to attack Prithviraj
 shahabadadin acchhee tarah jaanata tha ki jab tak uttar bharat main mahashaktishaalee jayachand ko parrast na kiya jayega dilli or ajmer aadi bhu-bhaagon par kiya gaya adhikaar sthaayee na hoga kyonki jayachand ke purvajon ne or swayan jayachand ne turko se anekon baar morcha lekar haraya tha
 - Ibn Naseer arli history of india naamak itihaas vishyak pustak menitihasaakar smith ne is aarope kaa kahin ullekh nahin kiya he
 The belief that Gauri was invited by Jaichand against Prithviraj does not seem to be correct as Muslim writers have not mentioned it anywhere

 ye lekhnee dwaara nahin balki lok-jihva kaa sahaara lekar jan-maanas se nicksruth hokar aaj tak jivit rahe
 Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi said that in folk songs, the earth sings, the mountains sing, the rivers sing, the crops sing
 utsav, meley or anya avasaron par madhur kanthon main lok samooh loakgeet gaate hai
 In the words of Late Ramnaresh Tripathi, as if a river flows through a dark dark cave and no one knows its origin, this is the condition accepted by the learned mystics about folklore

 ek pareekshan ke anusaar, isse prabhavit adhiktar log 35 saal se kam aayu ke the or kuch kii to ek do saal pehle hi shaadi hui thi
 Accordingly, testosterone levels play an important role in decision making and patients whose levels were elevated without their knowledge, their social behavior became more positive towards society than others
 jin rogiyon kaa maananaa tha ki testosteron adhikta se aakraamak vyavhaar utpann hota he athwa jinhone jaankaree main maatra lee, unka pradarshan apekshaakrit kam thik rahaa
 The testosteron hormone of masculinity is also helpful in making muscles strong
 chikitsakon ke anusaar testosteron kii adhik maatr ke dushprabhav bhi ho sakate hai
 In addition to economic pressures and rising inflation, social problems can cause a drop in the levels of hormones called testosterone in men, and this decline eventually leads to problems such as erectile dysfunction

 In support of Pasteur's germ theory, we have increasingly induced immunity to prevent the risk associated with wild infection
 aashaa he ki unmukti ke aanvik aadhaar ko samajhane ke aage bhavishya main sudhaar naidanik abhyaas karne ke liye anuwaad karenge
 This article gives a detailed article of each historical and logical sequence of the main topics
 dekhen mukhya lekh variolation or chechak
 First of all, artificial induction of immunity in humans was recorded by variolation or vaccination, which was done to control a less fatal smallpox infection, which gives it immunity from its more lethal natural form, Sheetla Major
 yah bharat or china ke pracheen samay main prachlit tha or europe main aaayaatit, turki ke madhyam se, 1720 ke aasapaas ladi Montagu or shaayad dusron ke dwaara hua
 The technique spread rapidly from England to the colonies and also spread to Boston by the arrival of African slaves
 Variolation kaa nuksaan he ki inoculating agent, ab bhi chechak kaa ek sakriy rup tha or, haalanki kam shaktishaalee tha, lekin abhi bhi inoculee ko maar saktaa he or apane purna rup main dusron main paas fail saktaa he
 However, the risk of death from vaccinations of smallpox minor was 1% to 2%, as compared to the 20% risk of natural death of smallpox, the risk of vaccination was generally accepted as acceptable
 dekhen mukhya lekhaedward jenertikaakaran or edward jennar In 1796, Edward Jenner, a doctor and scientist who practiced variolation, conducted a test on the grounds that Goshtila infection had minor disease symptoms, was never fatal and immunity from smallpox was also awarded
 Jenner transferred material from one patient's wound to another patient, thus transitioning the second patient from Goshtila
 uske baad unhone dikhaa diya ki ujagar dwaara chechak ke khilaaf pratiraksha thi
 This theory was demonstrated a few years ago by Benjamin Jesty, but was not publicized
 jennar ne yah prakriya varnit or samanyikrut kii or phir gosheetla ke chikitsakeey main prajnan kiya or is khoj kaa shrey unhen diya jaataa he
 Vaccination took over from variolation
 jennar, un dinon main sab royal socity ke sadasyon kii tarah ek anubhavvaadi the
 The support for further progress in vaccination theory came later
 mukhya lekh dekhen lui pashchar or rogaanu siddhant
 Louis Pasteur falsified the popular theory of proven natural spontaneous experiments and derived modern germ theory
 is siddhant ke aadhaar par ki vishisht sankramak rogon ke kaaran sookshm jeevanuon he, pashchar ne anthrex ke agent kaa pruthak kiya
 He then derived the vaccine from the harmless transformation of the infectious agent and then gave the infectious agents in this inactive form to farm animals, which proved to be immune to the disease
 pashchar ne rebies sankramak agent ke liye ek alag aprishkrut kii taiyaari kii 
 ek bahadur dawa vikaas main, unhone shaayad ek vyakti kii jaan bachaai, jise ek pagal unmatta kute ne kaata tha or us rogi ko niskriy rebies kii taiyaari se inoculate kiya gaya tha
 And thus the patient who desired to die was the first person successfully vaccinated against rabies
 ab janaa jaataa he, anthrex ek jeevanu ke kaaran hota he or rebies ek virus kii vajah se hota he
 Microscopes of the time were expected to be able to show bacteria reasonably well, but imaging of viruses had to wait until the 20th century to develop a resolved, electron microscope of greater lens potential
 kuch rog, jaise dhanustambh, kaa kaaran jeevanu ke vikaas ke kaaran nahin lekin jeevanuj vish ke utpaadan dwaara he
 Tetanus toxin is so deadly that humans cannot be immune to natural infections, because the amount and time needed to kill a person, compared to the immune system recognizing the toxin and producing antibodies against the toxin, is much is less
 haalanki tetanus vish aasaani se vikrut ho saktaa he, jisaki vajah se yah apni rog utpaadan karne ki kshamta kho detaa he, lekin tetanus injection se yah rogakshmata utpann karne main sakasham he
 The deformed toxin is called the toxoid
 botulism bhi dekhen See the main article Quantitative medicine in immunology
 tikaakaran ke liye toxoids jaise saral anu ke upyog se, pratirakshan pranali kam pratiraksha pratikriya or kam rogksham smriti utpann karata he
 However, adding some substances to the mixture, for example, adsorption of tetanus toxoid onto alum, enhances the immune response
 ye padaarth gunavardhak aushadhi ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Many different qualitative drugs are used to prepare the vaccine
 gunavardhak aushadhi pratiraksha pranali shodh main istemaal kiya gaya he
 a more contemporary approach to "enhance immunity" for more simple antigen molecules is to conjugate antigen
 sanyugman, pratijan kaa ek anya padaarth se lagaav he jo bhi ek pratiraksha pratikriya utpann karata he, is prakaar kul pratikriya badhaata he or pratijan ke liye ek or adhik majboot pratiraksha smriti paidaa karata he
 For example, a toxoid may be attached to the polysaccharide of the capsule of most bacteria responsible for lobar pneumonia
 immunoglobulin bhi dekhen
 To induce temporary immune immunity from specific infections, a specific immunoglobulin or outside molecule may be produced in the form of antibodies
 yah pehle pradarshan kiya tha, pehle se hi rogksham vyakti ke rakt se serum ansh alag karne ke baad, us vyakti ko is serum kaa injection de jis ke liye rogakshmata vaanchit he
 This is called passive immunity and the serum that is injected from one person to another is sometimes called antiserum
 serumrodhi anya stanadhariyon se, vishesh rup se ghodon se, aksar manushyon main aamtaur par jivan parinaam bachat or prayog kiya gaya he, lekin vahaan gambhir samvednaatmak pratikriya ke sadame kaa or maut se bhi khatra he, kyonki kuch maanav sharir kabhi kabhi anya jaanwaron se antibody ko videshi protein ke rup main pahachaanata he
 Passive immunity is temporary, because the life of the transferred antibody is only 3–6 months
 har garbh-naal stanpayi asthai rup ne pratiraksha anubhav kii he, apni maan ke placenta ke paar se mutabiq antibody hastantaran ke dwaara, jisaki vajah use niskriy rogakshmata prerit he - jo kuch apni maan ko niskriy rogakshmata ke liye pratiraksha tha
 This allows some protection for the young, while developing his own immune system
 synthetic maanav immunoglobulin banaaya ja saktaa he, sahit kai kaarnon ke liye or aksar adhik or adhik upyog hone kii sambhaavna he
 However, they are expensive to manufacture and are not as mass-produced as in 2006
 bhavishya main yah ho saktaa he ki antibody kritrim rup se dizin ho vishisht pratijanon main feet, phir unhen badi maatra main upaj kar ke, asthaayee rogakshmata logon main paidaa kar sakate hai, ek vishesh rogazanq pradarshan se pehle, jaise jeevanu, ek virus, yaa prion
 vartmaan main, is prakriya ko samajhane ke liye vigyaan uplabdh he, yah takanic pradarshan karne ke liye uplabdh nahin he

 In common language, it can be called the limit of "return impossible", that is, the gravity beyond it becomes so fierce that nothing, whether object or light, can get out of here
 isaki sab se adhik di jane vaali misaal "kaala chhidr" he
 If light arises from an object inside the event horizons of black holes, it remains within the boundary of the event horizon forever - the person outside it can never see it
 yahi vajah he ki kaale chhidr kaale lagate hai - unase koi roshni nahin nikalati
 When something starts falling towards the black hole in its gravitational chapel, as it starts to come close to the boundary of the event horizon, the terrible effects of gravity start showing amazing effects of the theory of relativity
 dur se dekhne waalon ko aisa lagata he ke us vastu kii kaale chhidr ke taraf girane kii gati dhimi hoti ja rahi he or uski chhavi main laalimaa badhati ja rahi he
 The viewers never see that the object crosses the event cycle
 lekin us vastu ko aisa koi prabhaav mahasoos nahin hota - use lagata he ke vah tezi se kaale chhidr kii taraf girakar ghatana kshitij paar kar jaati he
 Because of relativity, the speed of time of the observer and that object becomes very different

, which help to tell the story of the incident
 These clues are called trace clues because they are very small in appearance
 These clues are generated by transferring or disbursing any 2 things
 These clues help to recreate any event
 Or even indicate the presence or absence of any human being
 Trace clues are helpful in investigating the accident because in these crimes many speed from one speed to another
 Juveniles are interchangeable
 By collecting these clues carefully, one can get a lot of information from any event which is helpful in describing the state of any crime
 Trace clues test many substances It is done such as: hair, glass, paint, fibers etc

 39 manovigyaan aadhunik yug kii naveenatam vidya he
 By the way, psychology started in Greece 2,000 years ago
 plato ore arestu ke lekhon main use ham dekhte hai
 Psychological thinking was lacking in Europe during the medieval period
 aadhunik yug main iskaa prarambh isa kii atharahavi shatabdi main hua
 But at that time psychology was only a companion of philosophies
 uskaa koi swatantra astitv nahin tha
 Psychology had an independent existence in the 19th century, but even at this time, scholars had knowledge of the conscious mind of man
 unhen uske achetan man kaa gyaan nahin tha
 When the unconscious mind was discovered, it was found that the knowledge that was about the mind was part of its small part
 aadhunik manovigyaan kii khoj, chikitsa vigyaan ke kaaryakartaaon kii dein hai
 These discoveries were started by Dr
 Freud
 unke shishy alfred edler charles yugan wiliam stekil or frenkaji ne ise aage badhaayaa
 Dr
 Freud himself was initially a physician of physical diseases
 unke yahan kuch aise rogi aae jinaki sab prakaar kii shaareerik chikitsa hote hue bhi rog jaataa nahin tha
 Some such complex patients were treated by Dr
 Brewer only by talking daily and listening to the patient's agony every day
 dow broar ke is anubhav se yah pataa chalaa ki manushya ke bahut se shaareerik ore maansik rog aise bhi hote hai, jo kisi prakaar kii prabal bhaawanaaon ke damit hone se utpann ho jate hai, ore jab in bhaawanaaon kaa dhire-dhire prakaashan ho jaataa he to ye samaapt bhi ho jate hai
 Dr
 Freud's main gift is the discovery of repressed emotions
 inaki khoj karte hue unhen pataa chalaa ki munashya ke man ke kai bhaag hai
 Generally, the part he knows is his conscious mind
 is man ke pare man kaa vah bhaag he jahaan manushya kaa vah gyaan sanchit rahata he jise vah bade parishram ke saath ikattha karata he
 There are also desires in this part which are not currently being implemented, but which have been suppressed by the person
 man kaa yah bhaag avchetan man kaha jaataa he
 Beyond this is the unconscious mind of man
 man ke is bhaag main munashya kii aisi icchaayen, aakankshaayen, smritiyaan or samveg rahete hai, jinhen use barabas dabaanaa or bhul janaa padataa he
 These repressed feelings and desires get organized in the unconscious mind of the person and then they create a state of tension and conflict in his personality
 is prakaar ke damit bhaavon, ichchhaaon ore smritiyon ko maansik granthiyaan kaha jaataa hai
 There are many such strong glands in the mind of a mental patient, the patient himself does not have knowledge and he does not even want to accept them
 aisi hi damit granthiyaan anek prakaar ke maansik tathaa shaareerik rogon main vyaapt hoti hai
 Hysteria is one of them
 yah rog kabhi kabhi shaareerik rog banakar pragat hota he tab ise roopantarrit histyria kaha jaataa he
 Man's unconscious mind not only has repressed, undesirable and immoral feelings, but also holds repressive moral beliefs
 in naitik dharanaon kaa gyaan vyakti ke chetan man ko na hone ke kaaran unamem saralata se paraveerthan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The struggle of lustful, antisocial feelings and desires present in a man's goodness and his unconscious mind occurs unknowingly
 munashya kaa suswatv us kute ke samaan he jo manushya ke achetan man main upasthit asaamaajik vichaaron or ichchhaaon ko chetana ke str par aakar prakashit nahin hone detaa
 Then these repressed expressions are published by changing their form in the waking state of man or in his self-state, while his nature becomes somewhat loose
 yahi bhav anek prakaar ke rup badalakar shaareerik rogon athwa aacharan ke dosha main prakashit hote hai
 Dr
 Freud created a new science for the dream
 unke kathananusaar swapn achetan man main upasthit damit bhaawanaaon ke kaaryon kaa parinaam he
 By knowing the dream of a person and applying its proper meaning, we can know his repressed feelings and help him in ending his mental division
 aadhunik manovigyaan kii khoj dow frid ke uparshyukt khojon ke aage bhi gai hai
 His disciple Dr
 Yung told that the root of human goodness is not only in his personal experience, but it is in the experience of the entire human society
 isi kaaran jab manushya samaaj kii manyataon ke pratikul aacharan karata he to uske bhitari man main akaaran hi dand kaa bhay utpann ho jaataa he
 This fear does not go away until a man accepts his moral error and makes atonement for it
 is tarah kii aatmasweekruti or praayshchit se manushya ke bhogavaadi swatv or suswatv arthath samajahitkaari upasthit swatv main ekta sthapit ho jaati he
 Man does not get mental peace either by the disregard of theistic possessions nor by the disregard of goodness
 donon ke samanvay se hi maansik swasthya or prasannataa kaa anubhav hota he
 Dr
 William Brown, a famous psychologist from England, also tells of a power in the personality of man beyond all the above mentioned levels of mind, which is beyond the limits of country and time
 isaki anubhuti manushya ko maansik or shaareerik shithilikaran kii avasthaa main hoti he
 He states that when man ceases all his forms of contemplation and when he falls into such a state of calm, he establishes a unity within himself which is the center of immense power and Due to which, on establishing unity for a short time, many types of physical and mental diseases are calmed
 isse ekatv sthapit karne ke baad manushya ke vichaar ek nayaa mode le lete hai
 Then a thought becomes healthy rather than pathological
 aadhunik manovigyaan ab bhagwaan buddha or maharishi pathanjali kii khojon kii ore ja rahaa he
 Beyond the above three parts of the mind, there is also a condition which can be called zero form on one side and infinite knowledge on the other

 besimar prakriya, pighale hue dhalwaan lohe se bade paimaane par steel ke utpaadan ke liye pehali sasti audyogic prakriya thi
 The process was named after its inventor, Henry Bessemer, who patented the process in 1855
 The process was independently discovered in 1851 by William Kelly
 is prakriya ko saikadon saalon se europe ke baahar bhi istemaal kiya jaataa rahaa he, lekin yah audyogic str par nahin hota tha
 Its main principle is to remove the impurities of iron by oxidation by hitting the air spray on the molten iron
 oxikaran lohe ke dravyaman ke taapmaana ko bhi badha detaa he or ise pighali hui avasthaa main banaae rakhata he
 The process using the original refractory layer is known as the original Bessemer process, or the Gilchrist Thomas process, named after its inventor, Sydney Gilchrist Thomas
 yah prakriya ek bade andakaar steel ke paatr main kii jaati he jisamen chikani mitti yaa dolomite kii paraten lagi hoti hai, ise besimar parivartak kaha jaataa he
 The capacity of this converter was 8 to 30 tons of molten iron and was normally filled by about 15 tons
 is parivartak ke sheersh par ek dhakkan laga hota he jo us taraf khulata he jahaan wo paatr se judaa hota he, isse loha andar daalaa jaataa he or taiyaar utpaada baahar nikaala jaataa he
 a number of holes are made in its bottom, which is called toureys, by which air pressure is applied in the converter
 yah parivartak ek ghoomane vaali dhuree par rakhaa hota he taaki padaarth daalane ke liye ise ghumaya ja sake, parivartan ke dauraan yah bilkul sidhaa ho jaataa he or phir baad main pighali hui steel ko baahar nikaalane ke liye waapas gum jaataa he
 The oxidation process removes impurities such as silicon, manganese, and carbon as oxides
 ye oxide gas ke rup main yaa thos lave ke rup main nikal jate hai
 The refractory layers in the converter also play a role in the change - the layers of clay are used in acid Bessemer, when light phosphorus is added to the raw material
 dolomite kaa prayog tab kiya jaataa he jab mul besimar main phosphorus zyada maatra main hoti he - ise gilcrist thomas parivartak ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, yah naam iske avishkaarak sidney gilcrist thomas ke naam par padaa he
 In order to provide the necessary properties to the steel, other materials can also be added to the molten steel, such as Spieglesian, after the transformation is complete
 aavashyak steel kaa praroopan ho jane ke baad ise baahar doi main daal diya jaataa tha or phir ise saanchon main sthanantarit kiya jaataa tha or halkaa dhaatumal peeche rah jaataa tha
 The transformation process, called a "blow", was completed in 20 minutes
 is avadhi ke dauraan ashuddhiyon ke oxikaran kii pragati ko parivartak ke munh se nikalne vaali lau se aanka jaataa tha: lau ke gunon kii recording ke photoilactric tareekon ke aadhunik upyog se antim utpaada kii gunvattta niyantran main blor ko kaaphi madad praapt hui he
 After venting, the liquids were re-carbonized at the desired point and other alloys were added based on the desired product
 besimar prakriya se pehle britain main dhalwaan lohe se carbon kii maatra kam karne ke liye koi prayogtmak vidhi nahin thi
 Steel was manufactured by the reverse process of adding carbon to carbon-free iron, which was usually imported from Sweden
 yah nirmaan prakriya jise sangyojan prakriya kaha jaataa he, isamen lohe kii garm salaakhon ko lakdi ke koyale ke saath pathar ke bakse main ek saptaah ke liye rakhaa jaataa tha
 This produced blister steel

 This process was refined in the 18th century with the introduction of Benjamin Huntman's crucible steel making technique, which took an additional three hours of firing time and required a large amount of additional coal

 Historians Joseph Neidheim and Wertime acknowledge that this method was the preceding process of the Bessemer process

 According to this book, after the outbreak of the Ceramian War, many British industrialists and investors showed interest in warfare techniques and Bessemer himself developed a technique for grooving artillery projectiles so that they could move around in the bore of the gun without using rifling
 
 He patented the method in 1854 and began developing it in conjunction with the French government
 france ke poligon main apni vidhi ke pareekshan ke safal din ke baad unhone cloud-itini mini ke saath baat kii jinhone kaha ki bade, baari ghumaane vaale projectile ke prayog main bandook kii kshamta ek mukhya baadha ho sakati he or vishesh rup se "


 vah nahin maanate kii 12-pounder kii kachche lohe kii bandook se 30-lb kaa shot fire karne ke liye yah surakshit nahin he
 The real question he asked was whether a gun could be made to bear such heavy projectiles? ”this was the reason that forced Bessemer to think about steel
 us samay steel ko bananaa kathin or manhagaa tha or parinaam swaroop iskaa istemaal chote item jaise chaaku-churi or yantra banane main kiya jaataa tha
 In early January 1855, he began working on a way to produce large quantities of the steel required for artillery, and in October he filed his first patent for the Bessemer process

 When Bessemer went to put them back in the doe, they found that they were still shells: hot air had turned the outer parts of the ingots into steel

 Bessemer granted patent licenses for its process to five ironworks for a total of £ 27,000, but the licenses did not produce quality steel as promised and Bessemer bought them back for £ 32,500
 unhone mahasoos kiya kii yah samasya lohe kii ashuddhiyon ke kaaran thi or nishkarsh nikaala ki iskaa samaadhaan yah jaankaar nikaala ja saktaa he ki vaayu kaa pravaah kab band karnaa he; taaki ashuddhiyaan jal jaaen or carbon kii sahi maatra batch jaae

 beshak, is tarah ke spasht mulya kaa patent aalochana se nahin bachaa or bahut se kshetron main unke khilaaf ashktata kii baaten swatantra rup se bahut jor dekar kahi gayin
 But Bessemer was fortunate enough to prove his patent without a legal quarrel, although he felt it would be appropriate to purchase the rights of a patentee, whereas in the case of Robert Forrester Mushet, they defaulted to the patent in 1859 due to unpaid fees
 Were free from the worry of going
 muset kii prakriya bilkul jaruri nahin thi or besimar ne 1865 main ise siddh kar diya, unhone keval apni prakriya kaa upyog karke banaai steel ke namoonon kii ek shrinkhalaa kaa pradarshan kiya, lekin besimar kii prakriya ke saath sangyojan ke rup main iske nikat saarvbhaumik adhigrahan ke dwaara muset kii prakriya ke mulya dikhaae gaye the
 It is difficult to say anything about the continuation of Mushet's patent, but in 1866 Robert Mushet's 16-year-old daughter arrived at the office of Henry Bessemer in London, arguing that Bessemer's success was based on the results of his father's work 
 besimar ne muset ko salanaa 300 pound kii vaarshik pension kaa bhugtan karne faisla kiya, yah bahut mahatvapurn raashi thi or iskaa bhugtan 25 varshon tak kiya gaya; or yah sambhav he ki muset dwaara kanoonee karrwai se bachane ke liye aisa kiya gaya ho
 In 1866, Bessemer paid the American locomotive engineer and journalist Zerah Colburn, who lives on Bedfort Street, London, to draw a weekly newspaper called Engineering
 colobern par paroapkaar karne vaale kaa naam bahut varshon baad hi ujagar ho sakaa tha
 Prior to launching engineering, Colburn had supported Bessemer's steel work and steelmaking through the pages of The Engineer
 besimar kii prakriya ne laagat kam karke steel nirmaan main krantikari parivartan kiya, iske saath hi isane is mahatvapurn kachche maal ke utpaadan ke paimaane or gati ko bhi bahut badha diya
 This process also reduced the need of the working class in steel making

 After the introduction of the Bessemer process, steel and iron prices became the same, and most manufacturers turned to steel
 saste steel kii uplabdhta ke kaaran bade pulon, railmargon, gaganchumbi imaaraton or bade jahaajon ke nirmaan ke liye iskaa upyog kiya jane laga
 Other important steel products — also made using the open furnace process — were steel cables, steel bars, and sheet steel, which enabled the manufacture of large, high-pressure boilers and heavy tensile reinforcing steel for machines before It was possible to make engines, gears, axles more powerful than that

 Bispoke is a British English word, which is used for many applications that mean the manufacture of an item according to specific instructions given by buyers
 haalanki ab iskaa prayog computer software se lekar lakjri kaaron tak kai vastuon ke liye hota he, par aitihaasik rup se yah keval sile gayi kapadon, sharts or maap va fitting vaale purushon ke anya paridhaanon ke liye hi lagu hota tha
 Specific aspects of bespoke tailoring are the complete control of the customer over the fabric, features and suitability used, and the way the garment is manufactured
 or adhik aam taur par, bispok ko vastu ke utpaadan main anukulan ke ucch str or upyogkarta kii bhagidaari ke rup main varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 The word bispoke is derived from the verb to bispeak, which means "to indicate something" and the special meaning is "to order to make it"
 The term bispoke in fashion is reserved for men's individual samples and crafted apparel synonymous with the term hut kocher and is in contrast to collectively manufactured ready-to-wear clothing
 haalanki united kingdom main bade paimaane par is shabd kaa prayog hota he, par sanyukt rajya america main shaayad hi kabhi iskaa is arth main prayog kiya jaataa he, yadhyapi bade paimaane vaale tailoring vyavsaay main kuch logon dwaara iskaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Bispoke fabrics are traditionally different from the sample marked for the customer and are therefore different from ready-to-wear, made in factories in finished condition and according to standardized sizes and on orders received from adjusted block patterns The measurements are made on the basis of produced
 in sandarbho ke virodh ko shuruaati taur par yah nahin mana ja saktaa ki bispok kapade aavashyak rup se behatar tareeke se nirmit hon, par 20 veen sadi ke prarambh main radimaid kapadon kii shuruyaat ke baad se bispok kapade or adhik mahange ho gayi he or aam taur par inkaa ucch gunvattta ke saath nirmaan hota he
 While the exclusivity provided by Huit Kochhar is protected by law in France, the British Advertising Standards Authority ruled that it is good to use the term bispoke for products that do not fully incorporate traditional methods of manufacture
 The Saville Bespoke Association, a trade group of traditional entrants, has opposed this view
 19 veen sadi ke ant tak bispok or radimaid kapadon ke bich seemaa rekha bani rahi, par, "kapadon kaa ek aparibhaashit kshetra dekha gaya, jisamen graahak kii maap lee jaati thi, par factory main hameshaa nahin to aksar, nikatatam maanak aakaar ke kapade banaaye jate the
 "the difference here is that bispoke dresses are made according to pre-existing samples and measurements, changing a standard pattern size to fit the customer
 takneekee parivartan is vibhed ko adhik sookshm banaata he, kyonki "fitting kii jarurat bispok or maap ke anusaar nirmaan donon ke liye badhati ja rahi he; bispok seva ke liye ek vyaktigat cat pattern kii jarurat pad sakati he, jo phir aage ke liye rakhaa jaataa he or ab maap ke anusaar bane maapan ko aksar computer main surakshit rakhaa jaataa he
 Even manual work, often considered a directive sign of bispoke, is now increasingly found in textiles made to measure, while machines are mostly used in parts of making bispoke suits
 " New York-based designer Craig Robinson defines construction as "tradition and personality versus conformity and custom", according to Bispoke and Measure
 da saivil ro bispok association saivil ro dargiyon kaa ek samooh he, jisane yah prayaas kiya ki apane trademark ke upyog ke liye kapadon kii nunatam jaruraton ko uplabdh karakar ek maanak nirdhaarit kiya jaye
 These standards specifically emphasize on: association ne nirdisht bees biduon ko tay kiya he, jinamein suut ke kuch khaas hisson, jinamein se prayek main kuch vivaran hai, jaise pachchikari kii lambaai kitni hogi yaa kin hisson kii silaai haath se honi chahie
 So far the association has not successfully established bispoke as a protected label compared to Huit Kochhar
 june 2008 main, ek british vigyaapan niamak edverticument standerds athurity ne faisla sunaaya ki ek vigyaapan, jisamen suut ko "'ek varking frem' ke andar rakhkar mashin dwaara kaata or sila jaataa he", use "aapke vyaktigat maapan or vinirdesh ke anusaar anokhe rup main bane bispok suut" ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 This does not violate the authority's self-proclaimed advertising code, especially the rule of truthfulness, as the use of the word bispoke was not likely to cause confusion
 yah nirnay bispok paridhaanon kii kam paaramparik paribhaasha tay karne main mahatvapurn tha, haalanki maap ke anusaar nirmaan kii puraani vishistataa ko manyata mili
 The decision quoted the Bispoke definition of the Oxford English Dictionary as "made to order" and stated that the Bispoke suit was "made entirely by hand and the specimen was cut according to an underline," It is loosely stitched at the secondary level, including the first fitting, so that the half-finished suit can be modified as needed ", while the suit made according to measurement is usually "will be cut by machine based on existing samples and adjusted according to customer's measurements
" "suits made entirely of bespoke and size are both" according to order "as they are made according to the customer's exact measurements and specifications, although this is not the case in off-the-peg suits
" vyutpattivigyaani maaikel quinian jaise kuch logon ne is nirnay ko kuch is rup main dekha ki "aitihaasik kala shabd ne vishay parivartan kiya he" kuch anya logon ne nishkarsh nikaala ki "bispok silaai, anaadhikrut taur par, kaa matlab paaramparik taur par shabdkosh main di gai paribhaasha se kahin aage jaataa he" or kaha ki eyese ne " yah ghoshnaa kar ek-agyani nirnay liya ki "bispok or maap ke anusaar nirmaan main koi antar nahin he

 Bali was the son of Virochan and grandson of Prahlada and was known as a compassionate demon king
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki apni tapasya tathaa taaqat ke madhyam se bali ne trilok par aadhipaty hasil kar liya tha
 Vamana, under the guise of a dwarf Brahmin, went to Bali and urged him to give three steps worth of land for his stay

 As Bali's grandfather Prahlada was a great devotee of Vishnu, Vamana decided to give Bali to the Hades and put his third step in Bali's head, which resulted in Bali reaching Hades

 In contrast to electron and neutron contingency pressure, neither the Earth nor the Sun have the required mass and therefore neither the required gravitational force

 a black hole is often defined as an object whose migration velocity is greater than the speed of light
 yah tasvirgunatmak rup se galat he lekin kalenidr kii trigya ke pariman ke kram ko samajhane kaa ek tarika pradaan karti he
 The escape velocity is the minimum speed an object must have so that the object escapes the orbit of a gravitational source before stopping
 prithvi par palaayan veg 11
2 kimi / second ke baraabar he, atah vastu chaahe koi bhi ho, ek goli yaa ek ball, ise prithvi kii sataha par waapas girane se bachane ke liye kam se kam 11
2 kimi / second kii gati se chalanaa hoga
 To calculate the migration velocity in Newtonian mechanics, suppose there is a heavy object whose mass m is centered at the origin
 ek m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman vaali duusari vastu mul se r { \ displaystyle r} kii duuri par v { \ displaystyle v} gati se shuru hoti he, infinity kii taraf bachakar nikalne kii koshish karti he, iske paas thik utani gatij urja honi chahie taaki vah nakaaratmak gurutvkarshan kii sambhavit urja se paar paa sake, baad main kuch bhi shesh na rahe: Thus, as it gets closer to r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r = \ infty}, its kinetic energy decreases, eventually reaching infinity without any motion
 yah formula critical palaayan veg v { \ displaystyle v} ko m { \ displaystyle M} or r { \ displaystyle r} ke sandarbh main darshata he
 But this formula also says that for each value of v { \ displaystyle v} and m { \ displaystyle M}, r { \ displaystyle r} has a critical value so that v { \ displaystyle v} is a particle of motion
 Only managed to escape: jab veg prakaash kii gati ke baraabar ho, yah ek kaalpanik neutonian dark star kii trigya pradaan karata he, ek neutonian sharir jahaan se prakaash kii gati se chalane vaala koi kan batch nahin saktaa he
 In the trend most commonly used for the value of the radius of a black hole, the radius of the event horizon is equal to this Newtonian value
 saamaanya saapekshata main, antariksh-samay kii vakrit prakruti or vibhinn nirdeshaankon ke chayan kii vajah se r nirdeshaank ko paribhaashit karnaa saral nahin he
 For this result to be true, the value of r must be defined so that r radius in curved space times a surface area of A sphere can still be revealed by this formula a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle a This definition of = 4 \ pi r ^ {2}} r makes sense only if the gravitational field is spherically symmetric, so that there are many jackals on top of one that have a uniform gravitational field
 kisi vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra se batch nikalne ke liye palaayan veg uske ghanatv par nirbhar karti he; yah he, uske dravyaman or maatra kaa anupaat
 a black hole is formed when an object becomes so dense that even light cannot escape from it for a particular distance, because the speed of light will be less than the escape velocity of the black hole
 neutonian gurutvkarshan ke vipareet, saamaanya saapekshata main, kalenidr se dur jaataa hua prakaash dhimaa nahin padataa he or vaapis nahin mudata he
 The Schwarzschild radius is still the last distance from which the light can escape to infinity, but the exit light, starting at the Schwarzschild radius, does not return, it remains outside
 schvarjaschild trigya andar, prayek vastu andar kii taraf gati karti he, kisi prakaar centre main kuchle jane hetu
 In general relativity, the mass of the black hole may remain centered on a gravitational singularity), it may be a point, a ring, a light beam, or a sphere; At present, exact information about it is not available
 is singhulerity ke aasapaas ek golakaar seemaa hoti he jise ghatana kshitij kaha jaataa he
 It is the 'returning place' to the event horizon, a boundary beyond which all matter and radiation are drawn towards the singularity within
 kendrastha is singhulerity or ghatana kshitij ke bich kii duuri kalenidr kaa aakaar hoti he or yah ikai main dravyaman ke dugane ke baraabar hoti he jahaan g or c baraabar 1 hai
 The radius of a black hole with a mass equal to the Sun is about 3 km

 Therefore, if the Sun is converted into a black hole of equal mass, the orbits of the planets will remain unchanged
 kai prakaar ke kalenidr hai, jo unke vishisht aakaar dwaara pahachaane jate hai
 When they form due to the gravitational collapse of a star, they are called stellar black holes
 gallexiyon ke centre main banane vaale kalahidron ke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai arab guna ho sakate hai, unhen vishalkay kaala chhidr kaha jaataa he kyonki ve ati vishaal hote hai
 There are also some intermediate black holes between these two scales, whose mass is up to several thousand times the solar mass
 bahut kam dravyaman vaale kalenidr kaa, jinke bare main aisa mana jaataa he ki unka nirmaan brahmand ke shuruaati itihaas main big baing ke dauraan hua hoga, ab bhi astitv bhi ho sakate hai or unhen primoradial kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 Presently, their existence is not yet certain
 pratyaksh taur par ek kalenidr ko dekh paanaa sambhav nahin he
 However, its presence can be gauged by its gravitational effect on the surrounding environment, particularly by microvasives and active galactic nuclei, where substances falling into nearby black holes overheat and emit large amounts of X-ray radiation Huh
 yah prekshan vidhi khagolavidon ko unke astitv kaa pataa lagane main sakasham banaati he
 Black holes are the only substances that meet these scales and conform to the framework of general relativity
 ek aise baari sharir kii avadharana jisase ki prakaash bhi bachane se asamarth ho ko, bhuvigyaani jon michel dwaara 1783 main henry kavendish ko likhe gayi ek patr main prakat kiya gaya tha or royal socity dwaara prakashit kiya gaya tha: In 1796, mathematician pierre-simon Laplace promoted the idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du sistem du Monde
 unnisvin sadi main in "dark stars" par dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha, kyonki tab aisa mana jaataa tha ki prakaash drabyaman rahit tarang he atah gurutv ke prabhaav se mukt he
 Contrary to the modern black hole concept, it was believed that the object behind the horizon could not collapse
 1915 main, albert oinstin ne apane saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko viksit kiya, ve pehle hi yah siddh kar chuke the ki gurutvkarshan prakaash kii gati par vastav main prabhaav daalata he
 a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild gave the solution of the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass, showing that the existence of a black hole is theoretically possible
 schvarjaschild trigya ko ab gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke ghatana kshitij kii trigya ke rup main janaa jaataa he, lekin is tathy ko us samay nahin samajha ja sakaa tha, udhaaharan ke liye schvarjaschild khud ise bhautik nahin maanate the
 Johannes Droste, a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave a similar solution a few months after Schwarzschild on point mass and wrote extensively more about its properties
 1930 main, khagolvid subramanyan chandrashekhar nen saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog karte hue yah gananaa kii ki electron-dijanret padaarth vaale ek gaiyr-chakrit sharir kaa saura dravyaman yadi 1
44 se adhik hua to uskaa patan ho jaayegaa
 His argument was opposed by Arthur Eddington, who believed that something would surely prevent this collapse
 edington aanshik rup se sahi the: chandrashekhar seemaa se thoda adhik drabyaman vaala safed bouna sitara patan ke baad neutron taare main parivartit ho jaayegaa
 lekin 1939 main, robert oppenheimer or unke sahyogiyon ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki chandrasekhar dwaara die gaye kaarnon kii vajah se, lagbhag teen se adhik saura drabyaman vaale sitara kaa patan ek blike hole ke rup main ho jaayegaa
 Oppenheimer and his co-authors used the Schwarzschild coordinate system, which produced mathematical specificity at the Schwarzschild radius, in other words, some of the components used in this equation became infinite at the Schwarzschild radius
 iskaa arth yah niklaa gaya ki schvarjaschild trigya ek "bulbule" kii seemaa thi jisamen samay "ruk" jaataa tha
 This is a valid point of view from outside, but not for those who fall inside
 is visheshta ke kaaran, patan ho chuke taron ko kuch samay ke liye "frozen stars " ke naam se janaa gaya, kyonki ek bahari paryvekshak ko taare kii sataha us samay main jami hui dikhaai degaa jis pal main taare kaa patan use schvarjaschild trigya ke andar le ja rahaa hoga
 This is a known feature of modern black holes, but it must be emphasized that the surface light of the frozen star redshifts very quickly and turns the black hole to black very quickly
 kai bhautikavid is vichaar ko sweekaar nahin kar paa rahe the ki schvarjaschild trigya ke bheetar samay ruk jaataa he or 20 varshon tak is bishay par logon ki ruchi nahin rahi thi
 In 1958, David Finkisten introduced the concept of the event horizon by presenting Eddington – Finkelstein coordinates, which enabled him to prove that the Schwarzschild surface r = 2 m is not a specificity but rather serves as an ideal monolithic membrane
 Is: The causal effects can cross it in one direction
 isamen or openhimer ke parinaamon ko koi khaas virodhabhas nahin tha, balki isane ek andar girte hue paryvekshak ke drushtikon ko shaamil karke iskaa vistaar hi kiya
 All theories up to now, including Finkelstein, covered only non-rotating black holes
 1963 main, roy ker ne aavarti blike hole ke liye ekadam sateek samaadhaan khoj liya
 Its rotated singularity was not a dot but a ring
 kuch samay baad, roger penros yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki singhulerity sabhi blike holon ke andar pai jaati hai
 In 1967, astronomers discovered Pulsar and within a few years were able to prove that the known Pulsars are fast-rotating neutron stars
 us samay tak, neutron taare bhi sirf saidhantik utsukata tak hi simit the
 Hence the discovery of pulsars aroused interest in all those high-density objects whose structure would have been possible by gravitational collapse
 bhautikavid jon whealer ko vyapak rup se 1967 main die gaye apane saarvajanik bhaashan hamaara brahmad: gyaat or agyaat main blike hole shabd ko gadhane kaa shrey diya jaataa he, adhik dushkar "gurutveey rup se purnatah patan ko praapt kar chukaa tara" ke ek vikalp ke rup main
 However, Wheeler insisted that the term was coined by someone else at the conference and he only adopted it as a useful short-word
 yah shabd 1964 main eni aving dwaara AAAS ko likhe ek patr main bhi uddhrut kiya gaya tha: When the entire fuel of a big star is burnt, a huge explosion occurs in it, which is called a supernova
 visphot ke baad jo padaarth bachataa he vah dhire dhire simatana shuru hota he or bahut hi ghaney pind kaa rup le letaa he jise neutron star kehete hai
 If the neutron star is too large, the pressure of gravity will be so low that it will shrink with its own weight and become so dense that a black hole will form and appear as a black hole, a black hole or a black hole
 no hair prameya main kaha gaya he ki, ek baar sthapit ho jane ke baad blike hole ke keval teen swatantra bhautik lakshan hote hai: dravyaman, charge or koniya gati
 If the values of these two black holes have the same values or parameters, then it becomes quite difficult to distinguish between them
 ye lakshan khaas hote hai kyonki ye blike hole ke baahar se dikhaai dete hai
 For example, a charged black hole, like any other charged object, pushes the same charge away, despite the fact that photons, which are responsible for the electrical and magnetic forces, do not escape the internal field
 iskaa kaaran he gous niyam, ek bade sphier se baahar nikalne vaala kul vidyut pravaah hameshaa samaan rahata he or sphier ke bheetar ke kul charge ko maapta he
 When the charge falls into the black hole, electric field lines persist and peek beyond the horizon, and these field lines conserve the total charge of all falling materials
 bijli kshetra line antat blike hole kii sataha par samaan rup se fail jaati hai, sataha par samaan kshetra line ghanatv sthapit karti hai
 In this context, the black hole acts like a common conducting sphere that has a certain resistivity
 isi tarah, blike hole ko samahit kiye hue ek sphere ke kul dravyaman ko gaus niyam ke gurutveey anuroop kaa upyog karke paaya ja saktaa he, blike hole se bahut dur baithe baithe
 Similarly, angular momentum can be measured from far away, by gravitational-magnetic field using frame dragging
 jab blike hole kisi padaarth ko nigalata he, uskaa kshitij gharshan yukt vistrut jhilli kii tarah dolan karata he, ek kshanik pranali, jab tak yah antim avasthaa main sthapit nahin ho jaataa
 This is different from other field theories such as electromagnetism or gauge theory, which never have any friction or resistivity because they are time reversible
 kyonki blike hole antat ek antim avasthaa main keval teen maapdandon ke saath sthapit hota he, praarambhik sthitiyon ke bare main jaankaree ko khone se bachaane kaa koi tarika nahin he: blike hole ke gurutvkarshan or vidyut kshetra uske andar jane vaali chizon ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree pradaan kar pate hai
 Missing information includes everything that cannot be measured at great distances from the black hole horizon, such as the total baryon number, the lepton number, and almost all other preserved pseudo-charges in particle physics
 yahan se karnaa he yah vyavhaar itnaa ajeeb he ki ise 'blike hole jaankaree nuksaan virodhabhas' kaha gaya he
 Traditionally, the disappearance of information in black holes is quite strange, because general relativity is a Lagrangian theory that appears to be time reversible and Hamiltonian from above
 lekin kshitij ke kaaran blike hole samay palatwaan nahin hota he: padaarth isamen ghus sakate hai par nikal nahin sakate
 The reversal of time in a common black hole is called a white hole, although entropy and quantum mechanics show that white holes are similar to black holes
 no-hair prameya hamaare brahmad or usamen shaamil padaarthon kii prakruti ke bare main kuch manyataon banaata he, jabaki anya manyatayen alag nishkarsh pradaan karti hai
 For example, if magnetic single-poles exist, as stated by some theories, magnetic charge would be the fourth parameter of a conventional black hole
 nimnlikhit maamalon ke liye no-hair prameya ke prati-udahaaran gyaat hai: These exceptions are sometimes unstable and sometimes do not lead away from black holes to newly preserved quantum numbers
 hamaare chaar-aiami or lagbhag sapaat brahmand main is prameya ko lagu hona chahie
 The simplest black hole is one that has a mass but has neither charge nor angular momentum
 in blike hole ko schvarjaschild blike hole ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, bhautikavid karl schvarjaschild ke naam par jinhone 1915 main is samaadhaan kii khoj kii thi
 This was the first reliable and accurate solution to be discovered for the Einstein field equation and according to the Birkhoff theorem it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric
 iskaa matlab yah he ki is tarah ke ek blike hole ke gurutvkarshan kshetra or samaan dravyaman kii kisi bhi anya golakaar vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra bich koi drishy antar nahin he
 For the black hole, the popular belief that it "pulls every object in" around itself is true only near its horizon; At a distance, its external gravitational field is essentially the same as that of ordinary heavy bodies
 blike hole ke adhik saamaanya samaadhaan 20 veen sadi ke uttarardh main khoje gayi the
 The Reisner – Nordström metric describes a black hole with electric charge, while the Kerr metric provides a rotating black hole
 kerr -newman metric saamanyatya adhik prachlit sthir blike hole samaadhaan he, jo charge or koniya gati donon kaa varnan karata he
 Although the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, charge and angular momentum are constrained by mass

 vidyut chumbakeey bal kii apekshaakrit badi takat ke kaaran, taron ke patan se banane vaale blike hole se apeksha kii jaati he ki ve taron ke neutral charge ko banaaye rakhenge
 Rotation has been considered a common feature of compact objects and it appears that the angular momentum of the binary hole X-ray source GRS 1915 + 105, a candidate for a black hole, is close to its maximum possible value
 blike hole ko saamanytah unke dravyaman ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se swatantra
 ghatana kshitij trigya, yaa shwarzschild trigya, dwaara nirdhaarit blike hole kaa aakaar dravyaman m { \ displaystyle m \ ,} ke anupaat main hota he, Where rsh { \ displaystyle r_ {sh} \ ,} is the Schwarzschild radius and m ⨀ { \ displaystyle m _ { \ bigodot}} is the mass of the Sun
 is prakaar ek blike hole kaa aakaar or dravyaman saadhaaran rup se sambandhit hote hai, roteshan se swatantra
 According to this criterion, black holes are classified as follows: blike hole kii vishistataa he ghatana kshitij kaa prakat hona; antariksh-samay kii ek seemaa jiske pare ghatnaayen ek bahari paryvekshak ko prabhavit nahin kar sakati hai
 As predicted by general relativity, the presence of mass distorts the space-time in such a way that the paths of the particles lead them to that mass
 blike hole ke ghatana kshitij par yah vikruti itani shaktishaalee ho jaati he ki baahar jane kaa koi maarg bachataa hi nahin he
 Once a particle enters the event horizon, it becomes inevitable to go inside the black hole
 dur khadey ek darshak ke liye, blike hole ke nikat kii ghadiyaan zyada dhire chalati prathit hongi
 Because of this effect, the spectator standing far away will notice that an object falling into a black hole slows down as it approaches its event horizon, seemingly taking infinite time to reach it
 usee samay is vastu kii sabhi kriyaayein dhimi ho jaati hai jiske parinaam swaroop nikalne vaala prakaash adhik laal or maddham prathit hota he, is prabhaav ko gravitational red shift kaha jaataa he
 Finally, the falling object becomes so dim that it stops appearing, at one point just before it reaches the event horizon
 gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke liye schvarjaschild trigya spherical ghatana kshitij ko seemaa-mukt karti he
 The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to the mass
 chakrit blike hole main vikrut, nonspherical ghatana kshitij hota he
 Since the event horizon is not a physical surface but only a mathematically defined boundary, there is nothing preventing matter or radiation from entering the black hole, only they are prevented from exiting
 blike hole ke liye saamaanya saapekshata dwaara diya gaya varnan ek sanniktan he or aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv prabhaav ghatana kshitij ke nikat se mahatvapurn ho jate hai
 This makes the observation of matter near the event horizon of a black hole, the study of general relativity and its proposed extents
 haalaanki blike hole swayan urja vikirit nahin karte hai, ghatana kshitij ke thik baahar se, hawking vikiran ke madhyam se, vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran or padaarth kan vikeern ho sakate hai
 Singularity occurs at the center of the black hole, where there is an infinite density due to the suppression of matter, the gravitational pull is infinitely powerful and there is infinite distortion in space-time
 iskaa matlab ek blike hole kaa dravyaman shunya volum vaale ek kshetra main purnatah sankuchit ho jaataa he
 This zero-volume, infinitely dense region at the center of a black hole is called gravitational singularity
 ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity kii lambaai, chaudai or oonchaai shunya hoti he; ek chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity challe ke aakaar kii hoti he or roteshan ke plane main sthit hoti he
 The rings have no thickness so there is no volume
 saamaanya saapekshata main singhulerity kii upasthiti ko saamanytah siddhant ke lagu na hone kaa sanket mana jaataa he
 Although this is expected; This occurs in situations where quantum mechanical effects should have been described, due to extremely high densities and particle interactions
 ab tak kwantum or gurutv ke prabhaav kaa ek hi siddhant main sangyojan karnaa sambhav nahin ho sakaa he
 It is generally expected that the theory of quantum gravity will contain black holes without singularity
 photone sphere shunya motaai vaali ek spherical seemaa he jahaan sphere kii sparsharekha main chalate hue photone ek gol kaksha main funs jaayenge
 For non-recurring black holes, the radius of the photon sphere is 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius
 ye kakshaen gatisheel rup se asthir hai, isliye koi bhi choti si gadbady bhi samay ke saath badi hoti jaayegi or yaa to use blike hole ke pare phenk degi yaa ghatana kshitij ke bheetar dhakel degi
 Although light can still escape from inside the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon region from the inside and outward trajectory will be occupied by a black hole
 isliye koi bhi prakaash jo photone sphere ke andar se baahar khadey ek darshak tak pahunchataa he, nishchit rup se photone sphere ke adanr parantu ghatana kshitij ke baahar kii kisi vastu dwaara utsarjit hua hoga
 Other compact objects such as neutron stars may also have photon spheres
 yah tathy is baat par aadhaarit he ki ek vastu kaa gurutv kshetra uske vaastavik aakaar par nirbhar nahin karata, isliye koi vastu jo schvarjaschild trigya ke 1
5 guna se adhik choti ho us, vastu ke drabyaman se sambandhit ek photone sphere vastav main hoga
 The rotating black hole surrounds the ergosphere salt in an inter-time zone in which it is impossible to stand still
 yah frem-dreging naamak ek prakriya kaa parinaam he; saamaanya saapekshata kii bhavishyavaanee he ki koi bhi chakrit drabyaman, swanyam ko ghere hue antariksh samay ko thodaa khinchne kii cheshtaa karegaa
 Any object near the rotating mass will start moving in the direction of the wheel
 ek chakrit blike hole ke liye ghatana kshitij ke paas iskaa prabhaav itnaa majboot ho jaataa he ki kisi vastu ko sthir khadey rahane maatr ke liye iske vipareet disha main prakaash ki gati se bhi tej chalanaa hoga
 The ergosphere of a black hole is surrounded by the following: argosphior ke bheetar, antariksh-samay prakaash se adhik gati se khinchaa jaataa he-- saamaanya saapekshata main bhautik vastuon kaa prakaash se tej gati se chalanaa varjit he, lekin antariksh-samay kshetron ko anumati detaa he ki ve anya antariksh-samay kshetron kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal saken
 Objects and radiation can remain in orbit within the ergosphere without falling into the center
 lekin ve mandara nahin sakate, kyonki iske liye unhen swayan ke antariksh-samay kshetra kii tulana main peeche kii ore prakaash se bhi tej chalane kii aavashyaktaa hogi, jo ek bahari darshak kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal rahe hai
 Objects and radiation can also escape from the ergosphere
 asal main penros prakriya bhavishyavaanee karti he ki vasteen kabhi kabhi agosphior ud kar baahar chali jaayengi, iske liye urja ve blike hole kii kuch urja ko "chura" kar praapt karengi
 If a large part of the total mass of objects escapes in this way, the speed of the black hole will slow down and eventually stop moving
 blike hole kii aakarshak chhavi ke kaaran yah sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kya vastav main is prakaar kii vicitra vastuon kaa astitv he, yaa ye oinstin samikarnon ke kaalpanik samaadhaan maatr he
 Einstein himself had the mistaken belief that the formation of black holes is not possible, as he believed that the angular momentum of particles leading to collapse would stabilize their motion
 isaki vajah se saamaanya saapekshata samudaay kai varshon tak iske virdohi parinaamon ko khaarij karata rahaa
 But some of them maintained the belief that black holes actually existed, and by the late 1960s they were able to convince most researchers that the creation of event horizons was indeed possible
 ek baar ek ghatana roger penros ne yah siddh kar diya ki uske bheetar kahin na kahin singulerity kaa nirmaan avashya hoga
 Shortly thereafter, Stephen Hawking demonstrated that syngularity existed in many cosmic solutions of the Big Bang, in the absence of scalar fields and other foreign matter
 kerr samaadhaan, no-hair prameya or blike hole ushmpravagiki ke niyamon ne darshaya ki blike hole ke bhautik lakshan saral hai or aasaani se samajhe ja sakate hai, inhen shodh ke sammanit vishyon kaa darja mil gaya
 It is believed that the primary process of building black holes may have been the gravitational collapse of heavy objects such as stars, but there are many other processes that can lead to the creation of black holes
 gurutveey patan tab hota he jab ek vastu kaa aantarik dabaav uske apane gurutvkarshan kaa virodh karne ke liye aparyaapt ho
 This usually occurs in stars because either the "fuel" is insufficient to maintain its temperature in the stars, or a star that was stationary would receive a lot of extra material but not raise its core temperature
 donon sthitiyon main, taare kaa taapmaana swayan ke vajan tale apane patan ko roak paane ke liye aparyaapt sabit hoga 
 This collapse can be prevented by the mutual pressure of the star components, the material condenses into an attractive dense state
 iskaa parinaam, ek prakaar kaa compact tara
 kis kism kaa compact tara banegaa yah avshesh ke drabyaman par nirbhar karegaa - patan ke kaaran hue parivartanon ke baad bache hue padaarthon nen bahari satahon ko nestnabud kar diya he
 Note that this will be much less than the original star - residues with more than 5 solar masses are produced by stars that must have been greater than 20 before their collapse
 yadi avshesh kaa dravyaman ~ 3-4 saura drabyaman se adhik ho-- kyonki mul tara yaa to bahut baari tha yaa avshesh ne atirikt drabyaman ekatra kar liya he)- neutron kaa apjaatya dabaav bhi patan ko rokane ke liye aparyaapt he
 After this, there is no known process that can stop this collapse and the object will degenerate into a black hole
 baari taron ke is gurutveey patan ko hi adhikansh taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike holon ke gathan ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Gravitational collapse requires much higher density
 brahmad ke vartmaan yug main yah ucch ghanatv keval taron main hi milti he, lekin praarambhik brahmad main big baing ke sheeghra baad ghanatv kaaphi adhik hua karte the, ho saktaa he isi ne blike hole ke nirmaan ko sambhav banaaya ho
 High density alone is not sufficient for the creation of a black hole because the uniform distribution of masses will not allow the mass to accumulate
 is ghaney madhyam main pracheen blike holon ke gathan hetu, praarambhik ghantviya gadabadiyon kaa hona aavashyak he jo baad main swayan ke gurutv ke prabhaav main bad saken
 There are wide differences in the size of these disturbances in various models of the early universe
 vibhinn modelon ne blike hole ke nirmaan kaa purvanumaan lagaaya tha, plank dravyaman se lekar saikadon hajaaron saura drabyamanon tak ke
 Therefore, primitive black holes can be the reason for the formation of any type of black hole
 gurutveey patan hi ekmaatr prakriya nahin he jo blike hole kaa nirmaan kar sakati he
 In theory, the creation of black holes is also possible in high-energy collisions that create sufficient densities
 haalaanki, abhi tak, aisi kisi bhi aisi koi ghatana ko pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main, kan twarak prayogon main drabyaman santulan kii kami ke rup main nahin paaya gaya he
 This implies that there should be a lower limit to the mass of the black hole
 siddhanthata, is seemaa ko plank dravyaman ke aasapaas hona chahie, jahaan aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum prabhaav saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko galat sabit kar denge
 For this reason, the possibility of creation of a black hole on or around the Earth can be completely ruled out
 haalaanki, kwantum gurutv ke kuch vikaas aisa darshaate hai ki is bandha kii seemaa kaaphi neeche ho sakati he
 For example, some Brainworld landscapes keep the Planck mass far below, perhaps as low as 1 tev / c2
 yah, sookshm blike hole ke nirmaan ko ucch urja takkaron yaa CERN ke vishaal hadran colider main sambhav kar saktaa he
 However, all these theories are quite imaginary and many scientists are of the opinion that the creation of black holes in these processes is not possible
 ek baar banane ke baad blike hole, atirikt padaarthon ke avasorana dwaara viksit hona jari rakhata he
 All black holes will continue to absorb interstellar dust and ubiquitous radiation, but none of these processes have any significant effect on the mass of a stellar black hole
 adhik mahatvapurn yogadan tab hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa nirmaan ek dwiadhari tara pranali main hoti he
 The black hole can absorb a large amount of matter from its partner after formation
 atyadhik bade yogadan tab praapt hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa anya taron yaa compact vastuon se vilay hota he
 The supermassive black holes at the center of most galaxies may have been formed by the merger of many smaller objects
 isi prakriya ko kuch madhyavarti drabyaman vaale blike holon ke nirmaan ke liye bhi prastaavit kiya gaya he
 As an object moves towards the event horizon, the horizon begins to swell and swallow it
 iske sheeghra baad trigya kaa vistaar puure hole main samaan rup se vitarit ho jaataa he
 In 1974, Stephen Hawking showed that black holes are not completely black, but they also emit small amounts of thermal radiation
 unhen yah parinaam mila ek sthir blike hole prishthbhumi main pramaatra kshetra siddhant kaa prayog karke
 The result of their equations is that a black hole must leave particles in an ideal black body spectrum
 yah prabhaav hawking vikiran ke rup main janaa gaya
 Since the Hawking result, many have verified this effect through various methods
 yadi blike hole vikiran kaa yah siddhant sahi he, to aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki blike hole vikiran ke tapiya kiranpunj ko nikaalenge or isse drabyaman kaa kshay hoga, kyonki saapekshata siddhant ke anusaar drabyaman ucch sanghanit urja maatr he 
 samay ke saath blike hole sikud kar hawa main ud jaayenge
 The temperature of this beam remains proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole, which in turn is inversely proportional to mass
 isliye bade blike hole chote blike hole se kam vikiran chhodte hai
 The Hawking temperature of a stellar black hole with 5 solar masses is about 12 nanokelvins
 yah antarikshawya sookshm-tarang prishthbhumi dwaara utpaadit 2
7K se kaaphi kam he
 Black holes with stellar mass gain more mass than they emit through Hawking radiation from the cosmic microwave background, so they spread rather than shrink
 2
7 k se adhik hawking taapmaana praapt karne ke liye, ek blike hole ko chandramaa se bhi halkaa hona padegaa 
 On the other hand if a black hole is very small, it is expected that its radiation effect will be very powerful
 ek blike hole jo manushyon kii tulana main bhi baari he, kshan main lupt ho jaayegaa
 a black hole weighing a car will take only one nanosecond to evaporate, during which time its brightness will exceed 200 times that of the sun
 halke blike hole se ummid kii jaati he ki ve or bhi teji se vashpit ho jaayenge, udhaaharan ke liye 1 tev / c 2 drabyaman vaala ek blike hole puri tarah lupt hone main 10−88 second se bhi kam samay lagayegaa
 Of course, for such a small black hole the quantum gravity effect is expected to play an important role and even - although recent developments in quantum gravity provide no clue to it - hypothetically such small black holes are stable Will be adhikansh abhivruddhi discs tathaa gas jet kii maujuudagi taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa spasht saboot nahin he, kyonki neutron taare or safed bunon jaisi anya adhik drabyaman vaali or ati ghani vasteen abhivruddhi discon or gas dhaaraon ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakati hai or unka vyavhaar vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa blike hole ke irdagird hota he
 But they can often help astronomers by telling them where the search for a black hole can prove to be fruitful
 magar duusari taraf, ati vishaal abhivruddhi discs or gas dharaaen atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa acha saboot ho sakati hai, kyonki jahaan tak ham jaanate hai keval ek blike hole hi in ghatnaon kii utpatti kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Static X-rays and gamma ray emissions also do not prove the presence of a black hole, but can tell astronomers where to search would be fruitful - and they have the advantage of being able to easily detect clouds of gas and gas Get out lekin shaktishaalee, aniyamit eks-re, gamma kirane or anya vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran yah sabit karne main madad kar sakate hai ki vah vishaal, ati ghani vastu ek blike hole nahin he, taaki "blike hole akhetak" kisi anya vastu kii taraf dhyaan kendrit kar saken
 Neutron stars and other very dense wires have surfaces and the collision with the surface at a high percentage of the speed of light emits intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals
 blike hole main koi thos sataha nahin hoti he, isliye kisi atyadhik drabyaman vaali ati saghan vastu ke irdagird aniyamit antaraal par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa abhaav, yah darshata he ki vahaan ek blike hole ke milane kii acchhee sambhaavna ho sakati he
 The intense but single-handed release of the gamma ray may indicate the birth of a "new" black hole, as astrophysicists think that the cause of grbs is either the gravitational collapse of a massive star or a collision between neutron stars, And both these events involve enough mass and pressure to create a black hole
 lekin aisa prathit hota he ki ek neutron taare or ek blike hole ke bich kaa takaraav bhi ek GRB paidaa kar saktaa he, isliye ek GRB saboot nahin he ki ek "nae" blike hole kaa gathan hua he
 All known grbs come from outside our own galaxy and most come from billions of light years away, so the black holes associated with them are actually billions of years old
 kuch antariksh-bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he ki kuch ati chamkile eks-re strot madhyavarti-drabyaman vaale blike hole ke abhivruddhi discs ho sakate hai
 Kasars are believed to be the accretion disks of a highly massaging black hole, as no known object is so powerful that it can emit so powerful
 qasaar puure vidyut-chumbakeey spectrum main shaktishaalee utsarjan utpann karte hai, jisamen shaamil hai yuvi, eks-re or gamma-kiran or apni ucch chamak ke kaaran ye kaaphi duuri se bhi dikhaai dete hai
 Between 5 and 25 percent of the quasars are "radio loud", a noun due to their powerful radio emission
 ek gurutveey lens kaa nirmaan tab hota he jab kisi bahut dur sthit ujjwal strot se aati hui prakaash kii kirane kisi vishalkay vastu ke aasapaas "mud" jaati hai, darshak or strot vastu ke bich
 is prakriya ko gurutveey lencing ke rup main janaa jaataa he or yah saamaanya saapekshata siddhant kii bhavishyavaaniyon main se ek he
 According to this theory, space "time" assimilates to create mass gravitational fields and therefore bend light as a result
 lens ke peeche ke strot kii chhavi ek paryvekshak ko kai chhaviyon ke rup main dikhaai pad sakati he
 If the source, the heavy lensing object and the observer are in a straight line, the source will appear as a ring behind the heavy object
 gurutveey lencing blike hole ke alaava anya vastuon ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he, kyonki koi bhi ati shaktishaalee gurutvkarshan kshetra prakaash kirnon ko modane kii kshamta rakhata he
 Some of these multi-image effects are probably caused by remotely located galaxies
 blike hole kii parikrama karti vasteen, kendriya vastu ke aasapaas ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa anveshan karti rahati hai
 An older example, discovered in the 1970s, is the accretion disk orbiting around the fictitious black hole responsible for Cygnus X-1, a well-known X-ray source
 haalaanki swayan padaarth ko to sidhe taur par nahin dekha ja saktaa, eksre kii timatimaahat mili secondon main jari rahati he, jaisaa ki lagbhag das saura drabyaman vaale ek blike hole ke chaaron ore parikrama karne vaale kisi garm pind rupi padaarth se abhivruddhi se thik pehle ummid kii jaati he
 The x-ray spectrum represents the specific shape that is expected from a disc containing orbiting relativistic materials, with an iron line emitted at ~ 6
4 kev, and widened to red and blue
 ek anya udhaaharan he S2 tara jise akashgangeey centre kii parikrama karte dekha jaataa he
 This star is several light hours away from a black hole with a ~ 3
5 × 106 solar mass, so its rotation speed can be noted
 paryvekshit kaksha ke centre main kuch bhi dikhaai nahin detaa he, jaisaa ki ek kaali vastu se ummid kii jaati he
 Semi-periodic oscillations can be used to determine the mass of a black hole
 yah takanic blike hole or uske aasapaas kii discon ke bhitari bhaag ke bich ke sambandh kaa upyog karti he, jahaan gas ghatana kshitij tak pahunchne se pehle bheetar kii ore ghumaavdaar rup main aati rahati he
 As the gas collapses inward, it transmits x-ray radiation whose intensity is less than a certain order and which repeats itself at a regular interval
 yah sanketak ardh-aavadhik dolan yaa QPO kehalaata he
 The frequency of a QPO depends on the mass of the black hole; The smaller black hole has an event horizon located close to it, so the QPO has a higher frequency
 adhik dravyaman vaale blike hole ke liye, ghatana kshitij kaaphi aage baahar kii ore hota he, isliye QPO aavriti kam hoti he
 It is now widely accepted that every galaxy, or nearly every one, has a supermassive black hole at its center
 is blike hole ke dravyaman or mejabaan akashganga ke ubhaar ke bich jo najdiki sahasambandh he, vah yah darshata he ki akashganga or blike hole ke nirmaan ke bich kaaphi gaharaa sambandh he
 For decades, astronomers used the term "active galaxy" to describe galaxies that had unusual characteristics, such as unusual spectral line emission and super-powerful radio emission
 haalanki, saidhantik or paryvekshaniya adhyayan dikhaate hai ki in akashgangaon ke sakriy gangey nabhik main ati vishalkay blike hole ho sakate hai
 These AGN models have a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times heavier than the sun; a gas and dust disk called accretion disk; And two currents that are perpendicular to the accretion disk
 haalaanki, ummid kii jaati he ki ati vishalkay blike hole lagbhag sabhi AGN main paae jaayenge, sirf kuch hi akashgangaon ke nabhikon kaa dhyaan purvak adhyayan kiya gaya he is prayaas main ki centrestha ati vishalkay blike hole ummidavaaron kii pahchaan or vaastavik dravyaman kii maap, donon kii ja sake
 Examples of such notable galaxies are the Andromeda galaxy, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and the Sombrero galaxy
 khagolavidon kaa vishwaas he ki hamaari apni akashganga ke centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole sthit he, segitarius A* naamak kshetra main, kyonki: In 2002, observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope indicate that there are likely to be intermediate-mass black holes in spherical clusters called M15 and G1
 yah vyakhya golakaar samoohon main taron ke kaksha ke aakaar or avadhi par aadhaarit he
 But the Habbal proof is not conclusive, because a group of neutron stars can be the reason for such observations
 haal kii khojon tak, kai khagolvid sochate the ki golakaar samoohon main jatil gurutvkarshan antah-kriyaayen nae bane blike holon ko nishkasit kar dengi
 In November 2004, a team of astronomers reported the discovery of the first and fully verified intermediate-mass black hole of our galaxy, orbiting 3 light years away from Segitarius a *
 1300 saura dravyaman vaala yah blike hole saat taron ke ek samooh ke bich main he, sambhawatah yah ek vishaal tara samooh kaa avshesh he jo akaash ganga ke centre se chhitak gaya he
 This observation confirms that supermassive black holes grow by absorption of nearby small black holes and stars
 janvari 2007 main, united kingdom ke southempton vishvavidhyalay main shodhakartaaon ne ek blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, yah sambhawatah 10 saura dravyamanon waal tha or NGC 4472 naamak ek akashganga main sthit tha, lagbhag 5

 Our galaxy contains many possible stellar-mass black holes, which are closer to us than the supermassive black holes in the Sagittarian a * region
 ye sabhi ummidavaar eks-re dwiadhari pranaaliyon ke sadsy hai jisamen adhik ghani vastu apane saathi se ek abhivruddhi discs ke madhyam se padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he
 The black holes in these pairs can range from three to more than a dozen solar masses
 ab tak awalokit taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike holon main durtam, mesiye 33 akashganga main sthit dwiadhari pranali kaa sadsy he
 Theoretically there is no minimum size for a black hole
 ek baar inaki rachana ho jane par, inamen blike hole ke gun aa jate hai
 Stephen Hawking proposed that supermassive black holes can evaporate and become more microscopic, that is, micro black holes
 vashpit hote atiprarambhik blike hole kii khoj hetu fermi gamma-re spes telescope ko prastaavit kiya ja rahaa he, jiskaa prakshepan 11 june 2008 ko kiya gaya tha
 However, if microscopic black holes can be formed in other ways, such as by the impact of space rays or in colliders, this does not mean that they must certainly evaporate
 dharti par kan twarakon main blike hole ke anuroopon kaa nirmaan hone kii soochna he
 These black holes are not the same as the corresponding gravitational black holes, but they are important for examining the principles of gravity quantification
 ve majboot nabhikeey shakti ke siddhant ke anuroop hone kii vajah se blike hole kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, jinka gurutvkarshan or gurutvkarshan ke pramaatra siddhant se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 They are similar because both are described by string theory
 atah quark gluon plasma main aag ke gole ke gathan or vighatan kii vyakhya blike hole kii bhashaa main kii ja sakati he
 The fireball phenomenon in the relativistic heavy ion collider is very close to that of a black hole, and many of its physical properties can be predicted correctly using this analog
 aag kaa gola, haalaanki, ek gurutveey vastu nahin he
 It is not currently known whether a more energetic Large Hadron Collider will be capable of producing larger black holes with larger extra dimensions than expected, as suggested by several researchers
 adhik gaharaai se charchaa ke liye dekhen: large hadran colider main kan takaraav kii suraksha
 General relativity describes the possibility of a configuration in which two black holes are connected to each other
 is tarah ke vinyas ko aamtaur par ek varmhole kaha jaataa he
 Wormholes have inspired writers of fictional science fiction because they provide a means to quickly travel long distances, including time travel
 vyavhaar main, khagol bhautikee main aise vinyas lagbhag asambhav si baat hai, kyonki koi bhi gyaat prakriya in vastuon ke nirmaan kii anumati detii prathit nahin hoti he
 In 1971, Stephen Hawking showed that the total area of the event horizon of any collection of traditional black holes cannot be reduced even if they collide and swallow each other, that is, merge
 yah ullekhneey rup se ushmpravagiki ke dwitiya niyam ke samaan he, jahaan kshetra entropy kii bhoomika adaa karata he
 It was believed that the black hole entropy would be zero because of the zero temperature
 yadi aisa hota to entropy-krit padaarth ke blike hole main pravesh se ushmpravagiki ke duusare niyam kaa ulanghan hota tha, parinamswaroop brahmad kii kul entropy main kami aani chahie thi
 Therefore, Jacob Beckenstein proposed that a black hole needs an entropy and it should be proportional to the event horizon
 chunki blike hole paaramparik rup se vikiran nahin chhodte he, ushmpravagiki drushtikon ek anuroop maatr prathit hota he, kyonki shunya taapmaana kaa arth he ooshmaa ke kisi bhi yoga se entropy main anant parivartanon kaa hona, jiskaa arth he anant entropy
 However, in 1974, Hawking applied quantum field theory to curved space-time near the event horizon and found that black holes emit Hawking radiation, which is a kind of thermal radiation and is associated with the impact, which implies that That they have a positive temperature
 isane blike hole gatishiltaa or ushmpravagiki ke bich ke anurupan ko bal pradaan kiya: blike hole yantriki ke pehle niyam kaa upyog karte hue, yah nishkarsh niklaa ja saktaa he ki ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii entropy uske ghatana kshitij ke kshetra kii ek chauthai hogi
 This is a universal consequence and can be applied to the entire cosmic horizon, such as in the De Sittar space field
 baad main yah suzav aayaa ki ek blike hole adhiktam entropy vaali vastu he, arthath antariksh ke kisi ek kshetra kii adhiktam sambhav entropy us kshetra main samaa sakane vaale sabase bade blike hole kii entropy hogi
 This led to the creation of holographic theory
 hawking vikiran blike hole ke vishisht taapmaana ko darshata he, jisaki gananaa uski entropy se kii ja sakati he
 The higher the temperature falls, the more massive the black hole becomes: the more energy it absorbs, the more cold it becomes
 budh grah ke lagbhag dravyaman vaale blike hole main akashiya sookshm-tarang vikiran ke santulan main taapmaana hota he 
 When heavier than this, a black hole will be cooler than background radiation and it will receive energy from the background much faster than the energy emitted through Hawking radiation, it will also cool down
 haalaanki, ek kam baari blike hole main yah prabhaav yah darshaayegaa ki blike hole kaa dravyaman samay ke saath dhire dhire vashpit ho kar ud jaayegaa, jabaki blike hole aisa karte hue or adhik garam hota jaayegaa
 While these effects are negligible for black holes that are sufficiently heavy to be formed internally, they will become increasingly important for imaginary small black holes, where quantum-mechanical effects dominate
 vastav main, chote blike hole sambhawatah drut gati se vashpit honge or antat vikiran ke ek visphot ke saath lupt ho jaayenge
 Although general relativity can be used to calculate the entropy of a black hole, this condition is in principle not satisfactory
 sankhyikeey yantriki main, entropy kaa arth ek pranali kii sookshm vinyas kii sankhya kii gananaa ke rup main samajha jaataa he jinamein samaan sookshm gun ho 
 But without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity, such a calculation is not possible for a black hole
 haalaanki, string siddhant dwaara thodi aashaa jagaai gayi he, jiske anusaar blike hole kii swatantraaa kii sookshm maatra D-breance he
 By calculating the states of D-branes by the charge and energy provided, the entropy measurements of some particularly highly symmetric black holes can be obtained
 in gananaaon kii vaidhata ke kshetra ko vistrut karnaa, anusandhanon ke liye ek jari kaary kshetra he
 The so-called information loss paradox, or black hole centralization paradox, is an open question in fundamental physics
 paaramparik rup se, bhautik vigyaan ke niyam samaan hi rahenge, aage kii taraf badhen yaa peeche jaaen 
 That is, if the position and velocity of each particle of the universe is measured, we can work backwards to discover the history of the past universe at will
 luvil prameya fez spes volum ke sangrakshan kaa varnan karata he, jise "jaankaree ke sangrakshan" ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he, isliye sthapit bhautikee main bhi kuch samasya avashya he
 In quantum mechanics, this coincides with an important property called centralization, which is concerned with the conservation of probability
 haalaanki, blike hole is niyam kaa ulanghan kar sakate hai
 Under the established general relativity, this situation is subtle but clear: due to the established no-hair theorem, it can never be determined what went inside the black hole? However, when viewed from the outside, the information is never actually destroyed, as matter falling into a black hole takes infinite time to reach the event horizon
 is baat par jor dena aavashyak he ki saamaanya saapekshata ke sameekaran asal main tii-samarupata kaa paalan karte hai or yah tathy ki uparokt tark saamaanya saapekshata ke aplicoshan se hi aata he, hamen thodaa satark ho janaa chahie
 This is due to the fact that it is not possible by time-symmetric theory to reach time-reversal-asymmetric conclusions, which in this case is general relativity
 rindller nirdeshaank, jo ek bahari darshak ke liye ghatana kshitij ke nikat lagu hote hai, tii-samamit hai atah "aparivartaneey" prakriya jaisi kisi cheez ke astitv ko nakaara ja saktaa he
 It is possible that the "paradox" is the result of applying the time-asymmetric limit to the time-symmetric principle, making it a variant of the logistic paradox
 duusari ore, pramaatra gurutv ke bare main vichaar, yah suzav dete hai ki vahaan keval ek simit parimit utkram maap ho sakati he jo kshitij ke paas ke antariksh se sambandhit hogi: lekin kshitij ke utkram maap main parivartan or hawking vikiran kaa utkram maap sarvatha paryaapt hota he un padaarth or urja ke sabhi utkram maapon ko apane main samahit karne ke liye jo blike hole main gir rahen hon
 However, many physicists worry that it is still not properly understood
 khaas kar, ek pramaatra str par, hawking vikiran kii pramaatra avasthaa nirdhaarit hoti he keval is baat se ki blike hole main purv main kya gir chukaa he; or itihaas ki blike hole main kya gira tha ekmaatr nirdhaarit hoti he blike hole or vikiran ke pramaatra avasthaa dwaara
 This determinism and centralization will be required
 lambey samay tak stephen hawking ne is vichaar kaa birodh kiya, apni mul 1975 kii sthiti par ve ade rahe ki hawking vikiran puri tarah se tapiya he isliye purnataya avyavasthit he, blike hole dwaara purv main nigle gaye padaarthon kii koi bhi jaankaree maujuud nahin rahati he; unhonen tark diya ki is jaankaree kaa lop ho chukaa he
 However, on 21 July 2004, he introduced a new argument, contrary to his previous argument
 is nai gananaa main, blike hole se sambandhit utkram maap nikalakar hawking vikiran main hi jaataa he
 However, it is also difficult to understand in theory until the black hole completes its evaporation
 tab tak hawking vikiran kii jaankaree or vyavastha kii praarambhik avasthaa main 1:1 tareeke se sambhddha sthapit karnaa asambhav he
 Once the black holes evaporate completely, they can be identified and the centralization in them is preserved
 jis samay hawking ne apni gananaa puri kii, yah ads / CFT sambandh ke dwaara kaaphi spasht ho chukaa tha ki blike hole kaa kshay ekaatmak tareeke se hota he
 Because in gauge theories the fire spheres, which correspond to Hawking radiation, are definitely unitary
 hawking kii nai gananaa kaa visheshgy vaigyanik samudaay dwaara moolyankan nahin kiya gaya he, kyonki unke upyog kiye tareeke anjaane or sandigdh anurupata vaale hai
 But Hawking himself expressed enough confidence in it to pay for a bet he had made in 1997 with Caltech physicist John Preskill, which the media was interested in
 leonard saskind or nobel puraskaar vijeta jerard tii hooft ne yah suzav diya he ki blike hole ke chaaron or ke triayami antariksh ko ghatana kshitij ke ek dwiaiami vyavhaar dwaara purna rup se varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 They believe in this because this black hole can solve the information-loss paradox
 is vichaar ko string siddhant ke arntagat samayik kiya gaya he, tathaa holographic siddhant ke taur par janaa jaataa he
