 In Islam, the Quran mentions three different categories: Muslims, people of the book and idol worshipers
 Initially, Christians had a simple contradiction with the world's beliefs: Christian civilization versus foreign conversion or barbarism
 In the 18th century, "matantar" clearly meant Judaism and Islam; Lumped together in paganism, it was divided into four parts, sown in John Toland's compositions Najrenus or Jivish, Gentile, and Mahometan Christianity, separate "nations" or sects within the religion, three Abrahamic traditions as true monotheism

 In 1838, the four divisions of Christianity, Judaism, Mohammedan, and Paganism multiplied many times by Josiah Conder's Analytical and Comparative View of All Religions Now Extant Amang Mankind

" q "brahminical idolatry", Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Lamawad China and Japan and improved illiterate superstitions "

 raajnneeti praveshdwar The Federal Syrian Court or the Wafqi Sharai Adalat is a judicial institution in Pakistan, whose task is to investigate and determine whether the laws of the country follow Sharia
 is nikaay main kul aath musalmaan nyaayadhish hoti hai jisamen mukhya nyaayadhish bhi shaamil hote hai
 All these judges are appointed with the approval of the President of Pakistan who must be elected from the retired or serving judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan or any Provincial Court
 sangheey sharia adaalat ke maujuuda mukhya nyaayadhish nyaayamurti riyaj ahamed khan hai
 Out of the 8 judges of the Federal Sharia Court, 3 judges are required to have a ulema, whose study will be the Alam of Islamiyya and the system, who have highly rated skills in Islamic laws and rules
 is adaalat ke sabhi nyaayadhish 3 saal kii avadhi ke liye tainaat kiye jate hai
 The distant deployment of any judge can be extended at the discretion of the President of Pakistan
 yah adaalat, apane dam par kisi bhi naagarik yaa pakistani sarkaar ke anurodh par kisi bhi kanoon ko jaanchne kaa adhikaar rakhti he

 Ever since this court was established in 1980, this court has been subject to criticism and controversy at times, and has been controversial on several occasions
 ise sainya sarkaar main islamickaran ke daawey main is adaalat ko aathven sanshodhan ke dwaara sthapit kiya gaya tha
 According to opponents, this court is an institute set up in parallel which causes many complications, even affecting the sovereignty of Parliament, by influencing the decisions of the High Courts of princely-e-pakistan

 All the chemical substances in nature are generally found in solids, liquids and gases and plasma - these four states
 drav or gas pravaahit ho sakate hai, kintu thos pravaahit nahin hota
 In flexible solids, stress is produced by distorting the volume or shape
 alp vikrutiyon ke liye vikruti or pratibal paraspar samaanupati hote hai
 Due to this property, flexible solids have the ability to handle external forces up to a certain value
 pravaah kaa gun hone ke kaaran dravon or gaison ko taral padaarth kaha jaataa he
 These materials are unable to handle the shearing forces and due to the effect of gravity, they flow and take shape of the vessel in which they are kept
 thos or taral kaa yantric bhed bahut spasht nahin he
 Many substances, particularly the mechanical properties of high-grade polymers, are intermediate in properties of the viscous liquid and flexible solids
 prayek padaarth ke liye ek aisa kranthik taap paaya jaataa he, jisase adhik hone par padaarth keval taral avasthaa main rah saktaa he
 At critical temperature, there is no significant difference between the fluid and gas state of matter
 isse neeche ke prayek taap par drav ke saath uskaa kuch vaashp bhi upasthit rahata he or is vaashp kaa kuch nishchit dabaav bhi hota he
 This pressure is called vapor pressure
 prayek taap par vaashp dabaav kaa adhiktam maan nishchit hota he
 If this maximum pressure is equal to or greater than the summed-vapor-pressure, the fluid remains stable
 yadi upree dabaav drav ke sampruktavashp-dabaav se kam ho, to drav asthaayee hota he
 The combined-vapor-pressure increases with the increase of heat
 jis taap par drav kaa samprukt-vaashp-dabaav bahari vaataavaran ke dabaav ke baraabar ho jaataa he, usapar drav bahut teji se vashpit hone lagata he
 This temperature is called the boiling point of the fluid
 yadi bahari dabaav sarvatha sthaayee ho to kvathanank se neeche drav sthaayee rahata he
 On reaching the boiling point it starts to boil
 is dasha main yah taap kaa shoshan karke drav avasthaa se gas avasthaa main parivartit hone lagata he
 The number of calories of heat required to convert the unit mass of the fluid from the liquid to fully gas at the boiling point is called the latent heat of the evaporation of the fluid
 vibhinn drav padaarthon ke liye iskaa maan bhinn hota he
 Both solid and liquid forms can be found simultaneously at a certain temperature at a fixed pressure
 yah taap drav kaa himbindu yaa thos kaa dravnank kehalaata he
 The amount of heat required to convert the unit mass of a substance from solid to fully liquid at the eutectic point is called latent heat of the solid's melting
 acristali padaarthon ke liye koi niyat galnaank nahin paaya jaataa
 They gradually become soft on heating and then come to a fluid state
 kaanch tathaa kaanch jaise anya padaarth isi prakaar kaa vyavhaar karte hai
 The three states of each material can exist simultaneously at a fixed temperature and constant pressure
 dabaav or taap ke bich khichein gaye aarekh main ye niyat taap or dabaav ek bindu dwaara pradarshit kiye jate hai
 This point is called the triad of fluid
 trik vindu kii apeksha nimna daabon par drav asthaayee rahata he
 If a solid is heated at a lower pressure than the triple point, it becomes vapor without becoming liquid, that is, it becomes vertical
 drav ke mukt tal main, jo us drav ke vaashp yaa saamaanya vaayu ke sampark main rahata he, ek vishesh gun paaya jaataa he, jiske kaaran yah tal tani hui maheen jhilli jaisaa vyavhaar karata he
 This property is called surface tension
 prishth tanaav ke kaaran drav ke prishth kaa kshetrafal yathasambhav nunatam hota he
 The lowest area for a given volume is of a sphere
 at: aisi sthitiyon main jab ki bahari bal naganya maane ja sakate hon drav kii boonde gol hoti hai
 When a fluid comes in contact with a solid, or any other intracellular fluid, stress also occurs on the contact plane
 saadhaarant: koi bhi padaarth keval ek hi prakaar ke drav rup main praapt hota he, kintu iske kuch apwaad bhi milte hai, jaise helium gas ko dravit karke do prakaar ke helium drav praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 In the same way, para-azoxy-anisole can be obtained in the form of anisotropic liquid, in the crystalline state and also as a normal fluid
 prayek dravya ke anu ek duusare ko aakarshith kiye rahete hai
 This attraction is called interstitial attraction
 isi ke kaaran kisi dravya ke anu ekatra rahete hai
 There is also a repulsion force on the molecules of matter
 yah bal anuon ko ek duusare ke ati nikat aane se roktaa he
 These forces prevail between the molecules of a solid
 dravon main inke maan alp or gaison main lagbhag naganya hote hai
 The characteristic feature of a crystalline solid is that it has a well-organized arrangement of molecules in the near range and the far range
 kuch anu aapas main milakar chote chote gut bana lete hai
 These groups have the same internal structure
 inhen ekackoshika kehete hai
 This is called the system of close range
 dur paraas kii vyavastha kaa yah arth he ki crystalia thos kii ekackoshikaaye bhi vishesh dhang se vyavasthit rahati hai, arthath ekackoshika kii vyavastha manamaani nahin varan aavarti hoti he
 The main difference between liquid and solid is that there is no remote arrangement in the liquid
 nikataparaas vyavastha kuch had tak bani rah sakati he, jisase drav main bhi prayek anu ke chaaron ore sthit anuon kii sankhya baraabar hoti he
 The presence of such close range arrangement has been proved by scientists by experiments of X-ray diffraction

 foular ne eks-kiran vivartan kaa adhyayan kiya he or uski sankhya kaa phurye vishleshan karke is tathy ko pratipaadit kiya he
 Many theoretical efforts have been made to calculate the critical point, viscosity and other properties of a fluid
 pehle ke adhyayanon ke adhiktar lenard jones vibhav kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 The fluid theory of fluids is a relatively new theory
 bahut se drav vidyucchhuchaalak hai
 The reason for their conductivity is that they have independent electrons
 drav lavenon kii vidyucchalakata unke ynikaran par nirbhar karti he
 Other fluids can be divided into two main parts
 jo drav vidyunmay vastu kii ore-aakarshith hote hai, unhen dhruviya or jo aakarshith nahin hote unhen adhruviya kaha jaataa he
 The reality is that the polar fluids molecule has some dipole-momenta permanently, but the molecules of polar fluids do not
 benzene adhruviya drav he
 The polarity of polar fluids is found between 1 and 3
 inkaa drishy kshetreey vartanaank inke radio aavritiya paravaidyuthank ke vargamul ke baraabar hota he
 The polarity of polar fluids is about 10 to 100 times higher than the polarity of polar fluids, but they are roughly the same
 drav samaanyat: samdaishik hote hai
 The spectrum of fluids is very similar to the gaseous molecular spectrum of these substances
 par dravon ke raman or avarakt varnakram sangat gasiy varnakram se kuch bhinn hote hai
