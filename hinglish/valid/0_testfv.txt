 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is referred to as the British ruler, but in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 britain kii rajatantric vyavastha main, raja / rani ko rashtrapramukh kaa darj diya gaya he
 In the British political system, which has been progressively developing and changing over a period of thousands of years, the traditional and real powers of the ruler have been fluctuating

 Therefore, most of the works done by the rulers in the name of Rajmukut, whether done by the ruler himself, such as the Queen's address or the state inauguration of Parliament, the decisions of Surrey work are taken elsewhere: vidhayik kaary maharani sasansaad dwaara, sansad, house of lords or house of comons kii salaah or sweekruti dwaara kiya jaataa he, vahin, kaaryakari shaktiya maharani ke naam par unki mahima kii sarkaar dwaara abhyayit kiye jate hai

 visthapit carch of wales tathaa carch of ireland main samprabhu kaa koi aupchaarik bhoomika nahin he

 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession

 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment

 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey

 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession

 varttman samay main mukutiyaa esteton se ai mudra kii maatra civil list yaa adhirat ko pradaan kiye jane vaale anya anudaanon se bhi adhik he
 Thus between 2007-08 Crown Estates increased the treasury by £ 200 million, while 40 million pounds were paid by Parliament

 It is very easy to control them with the help of numerical bodies; Such as with the help of a microcontroller
 yadi chaal vyavasthaapan kaaphi vistrut paraas main karnaa ho, to shraag motor bahut upyukt hote hai
 In many places, operating characteristics of direct current, range motor is desirable
 isaki vyavastha karne ke liye prayavarti dhara motaron main bhi praytn kiya gaya he
 The alternating current range motor and the interchangeable motor provide similar characteristic features
 tulykaalik motor keval tulykaalik chaal par hi prachaalan kar sakate hai
 Therefore, where uniformity is required, these are ideal
 jis prakaar disht dhara janitr evam motor, vastut: ek hi mashin hai or donon ko kisi bhi rup main prayog karnaa sambhav he
 Similarly, synchronous motor is also, in fact, the form of alternating current generator, commonly called alternator, and it is possible to use both in any form
 iske prachaalan ke liye iske stater main prayavarti dhara sancharan tathaa roter main disht dhara uttejk donon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Use of these motors is somewhat limited
 disht dhara uttejan ke liye prayavartit kii bhanti hi inamen bhi ek uttejan ke liye prayavartit kii bhanti hi inamen bhi ek uttejk kii vyavastha hoti he
 The main advantage of these motors is that the power factor can also be increased by increasing the excitation
 at: visheshtya un udyogon main jahaan bahut se preran motor hone ke kaaran, athwa kisi or kaaran, se shaktigunank bahut kam ho jaataa he, vahaan tulykaalik motaron kii vyavastha kar shaktigunank ko sudhara ja saktaa he
 In many places these motors are used only for power factor correction
 aisi dasha main inhen tulykaalik sandharitra kaha jaataa he
 In many places only one-way feeding is available
 vahaan ekakaleey motor prayog kiye jate hai
 Single-phase induction motors are very popular for small machines and household works
 bijli ke pankhons main bhi ekakaleey motor prayukt hote hai
 Similarly, single-motor motors are predominant in the washing machines, refrigerators and sewing machines etc
 ekakaleey motaron kii mukhya kathinaayee inke aarambh karne main hoti hai
 Some kind of art diversion is necessary to get started
 kala vipatan saadharantaya ek sahaayak kundali dwaara kiya jaataa he, jiske aripath main ek sandharitra diya hota he, jo sahaayak kundalan kii dhara ko mukhya kundalan kii dhara se lagbhag 10 vidyut degree visthapit kar detaa he
 This may cause the creation of rotational magnetic fields and the motor starts moving
 sandharitra ke paripath main rahane se motor kaa prachaalan shaktigunank bhi sudhar jaataa he
 Many small motors are universal and can be used in both direct current and alternating current
 vastut: ye shrenee motor hote hai, jinka prachaalan disht dhara evam prayavarti dhara donon main hi prayukt kiye ja sakate hai
 In fact, these are class motors, which can operate both in direct current and alternating current, but they can be made in very small sizes and are used only in certain applications
 metron tathaa duusare ukaranon main tathaa jahaan kisi vidyut raashi kaa maapan karnaa ho vahaan atyant chote aakaar ke motor prayukt hote hai
 Many small motors are also used for remote control, or for opening valves, etc
 motor kaa upree aavaran vibhinn paristhitiyon ke anusaar banaaya jaataa he
 Some motors are open type, in which their inner parts are visible in front, but in such motors there is a fear of getting dust
 atev ye khule sthanon main nahin prayukt kiye ja sakate
 But natural ventilation is good in such motors
 atev ye shighrata se garam nahin hone pate
 For this reason such motors are of relatively high capacity according to size
 jahaan motor ko khule sthanon main prachaalan karnaa padataa he vahaan dhul mitti ityadi kaa dar ho saktaa he, at: purnataya aavruth motor prayukt kiye jate hai
 The main difficulty in such motors is ventilation
 inkaa aavaran bhi aisa banaaya jaataa he ki vah adhiktam ooshmaa vistarit kar sake
 At the same time, there is a system of a fan mounted on the same tree, which can enter the ventilation air inside the motor and expand the heat produced in it
 adhikansh prayojanon ke liye ardh-paribaddh motor santoshjanak hote hai, jinamein motor ke drushtigochar honevaale bhaag jaali dwaara dhake rahete hai
 Thus, there are benefits of both the above types
 vishesh paristhitiyon ke liye vishesh prakaar ke aavaran banaae jate hai, jaise khaanon ke andar athwa visphotak vaataavaran main purnataya jwalarahit motor prayukt kiye jate hai
 Similarly some motors are made to work under water and their cover is designed to work and their cover is designed in such a way that water cannot get inside the motor
 or bhi bahut si vibhinn paristhitiyon main vibhinn prakaar ke aavaran banaae jate hai
 Many motors are attached directly to the load and in many cases they are attached by bar, gear or chain
 gear se chaalak evam chaalit mashiinon main lagbhag sthir chaal anupaat poshit kiya ja saktaa he or gear kram badalakar vibhinn chaalen bhi praapt kii ja sakati hai
 The machine can also be placed far enough away from the motor to transmit power through the strip, and can also run a common isha to which other machines are associated
 bade bade kaarkaanon main saadharantaya yahi vinyas hota he
 The main limitation to the capacity of motors is the increase of heat
 taap ke badhane par kshat hone kaa bhi bhay rahata he, tathaa haniyon ke bad jane se motor kii dakshata bhi kam ho jaati he
 Thus the motor cannot operate continuously
 adhikansh motor ek vishisht taap vruddhi ke liye kshamit hote hai, jo vidyutarodhi ke varg par nirbhar karata he
 Many motors are of "continuous capacity", which means that they can sustain a constant load, to a specific limit without heating
 bahut se motor keval alp kaal ke liye hi purna bhaar par prachaalan karte hai or baaki samay bahut kam bhaar par rahete hai athwa band rahete hai
 If the operation is fixed, low-capacity motors for such purposes only operate at full load for short periods of time and remain at or off load for the rest of the time
 yadi prachaalankram nishchit ho, to aise prayojanon ke liye kam kshamta kii motaren prayog kii ja sakati hai, jinka prachaalan tathaa kshamta alp samay ke liye hi nirdhaarit hoti he
 1744 is a leap year of Gregory calendar
 rameshchandra dutt bharat ke prasiddh prashaasak, aarthik itihasajna tathaa lekhak tathaa ramayana va mahabharat ke anuvadak the
 Ramesh Chandra Dutt, one of the pioneers of Indian nationalism, occupies a prominent position in the history of economic thought
 dadabhai naurozi or major bi
 di
 basu ke saath dutt tisare aarthik chintak the jinhone aupniveshik shashan ke tahat bhartiya arthvyavastha ko hue nuksaan ke pramanik vivaran pesh kiye or vikhyath ‘dren thiyari’ kaa pratipaadan kiya
 This meant that the British were squeezing the Indian economy by constantly imposing exports to their advantage and charging unnecessary surcharges
 ramesh chandra dutt kaa janm 1848 main kolkata ke ek aise parivaar main hua tha jisane east india company ke tahat vyapaar karke kaaphi sampatti arjeet kii thi
 This ICS in 1868 Went to England to take the examination of and passed third place in this examination in 1869
 san 1871 main ye bharat waapas aae
 He wrote a book 'three Years in England' about his stay in England for these three years
 bharat aane ke baad inhone anek prashasnic padon kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaala tathaa urisa ke kamishnar evam polytical agent, baroda ke dewan or royal kamishan ke sadsy rahe
 In 1882, Ramesh Chandra Dutt continued to oversee administrative work in various districts of Bengal
 1883 main jila magistrate banane ke baad 1894 main bardhaman jile ke dipti kamishnar niyukt kiye gayi
 He was the first Indian to reach such a high position in the nineteenth century
 1897 main unhone isies se avkaash grahan kiya or 1904 tak kii avadhi europe main guzari
 He was also Professor of History at University College, London
 1899 main bhartiya rashtriya congress ke lakhanu adhiveshan ne unhen apana adhyaksh nirvaachit kiya
 From 1897 to 1904, he was Professor of Indian History at the University of London
 unka nidhan 1909 main hua
 Through his deep research and analysis, Dutt showed that the British rule not only failed to improve the physical condition of India, but also during its period India was de-industrialized
 british aarthik niti ke parinamswaroop bharat ke dastakaari utpaadan main jabardast giravat aayi or uski bharpai ke rup main audyogic utpaadan main badhotaree nahin hui
 Nor was Indian industry given any kind of protection
 nattejey ke taur par bhartiya arthvyavastha pehle se kahin zyaada kheti par nirbhar hone ke liye majaboor ho gayi
 Indian society continued to become rustic
 dutt kaa kahana tha ki british upniveshwaad ke kathith rachanaatmak kadamon se bhi bharat ko laabh nahin hua
 Due to rail transport started by the British, traditional transport services were killed and trains were used to carry goods made in British factories
 dutt kaa nishkarsh tha ki bhartiya arthvyavastha aviksit nahin he, balki uskaa vikaas avaruddh kar diya gaya he
 The history written by him defies the Marxist notion prevalent in a section of scholars according to which the role of British colonialism is seen to be progressive
 aarthik itihaaskaar ke alaava ramesh chandra dutt ek pratibhashali or kushal saanskrithik itihaaskaar bhi the
 Along with being the founder president of Bangi Sahitya Parishad, he also briefly wrote Mahabharata and Ramayana in English
 sanskrit sahitya ke pramaanon ke aadhaar par dutt ne bharat kii pracheen sabhyataa ke itihaas kii rachana bhi kii
 Apart from highlighting the ill effects of British economic policy, Dutt's second major contribution to the development of economic ideas was that he advocated setting limits to government intervention in the economy
 yah sifaarish unhone beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat main ek aise samay main kii jab anya bhartiya arthshaastri aarthik jivan main sarkaar ke hastkshep ko kam karne kii maang kar rahe the
 Dutt said that the government should avoid private initiative interventions but should be prepared to intervene under specific circumstances so as to avoid conflict of interest by avoiding temporary types of crises
 yatharth kaa akalan karne kii dutt kii paddati bhi us jamaane ke hisaab se alag tarah kii thi
 Dutt developed the concept of interdependence of economic and political facts, instead of considering one as the major and the other as his influence among the many reasons of reality
 unki manyata thi ki samaaj ke tantra main har chiz ek-duusare par nirbhar he, paraspar judi hui he isliye santulan bigaadane jaisaa koi bhi kaam nahin karnaa chahie
 However, Dutt also understood that balance is not always the same
 vah lagaataar badalata rahata he
 Therefore, the government should focus on the underlying dynamics of the immediate situation while intervening, or else its interventionist actions may result in the opposite
 arthshaastra par dutt kii rachanaaon kaa prakaashan 1900 se shuru hua
 His first book was 'famines and Land Assessment in India', which studied the famines in India, which was also praised by Russian anarchist philosopher Prince Kropatkin
 unki is kriti se zaahir tha ki ve bhartiya kisaan kii jivan-sthitiyon main kitni dilchaspee rakhte hai or unka aarthik chintan kis tarah se uski sthiti sudhaarney par kendrit he
 Dutt questioned why the people of India had to face ten horrific famines in the span of forty years since 1858? He asked that during this time the ruler was in the hands of the Empress rather than the East India Company
 is dauraan aamtaur par shanti rahi or keval ek hi yuddh hua
 The government had trained administrators who had sufficient experience in Indian conditions
 zamin upjau thi, kisaan udhyami or kifaayatshar the
 Despite such favorable circumstances, why did it happen that during these famines, about 1
5 crore people lost their lives due to hunger? Dutt did not agree to believe that the cause of famines is due to the rapid increase in population or that the farmers of India are careless, unconcerned and cynical
 unhone yah bhi sweekaar nahin kiya ki kisaanon kaa soodakhor mahajanon ke shikanje main fasaa hona akaal kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Dutt showed in his study that the growth rate of population in India was not only always lower than in England, but in the ten years before his study, the population of this country had stopped increasing
 dutt ke anusaar bharat se zyaada parishramee or kam karch main guzar-basar karne vaale kisaan duniya main or kahin nahin hai
 He cited the reports of commissions investigating the causes of famine and said that it is due to the rigorous recovery of government revenue that farmers have to depend on the Mahajans
 angrez sarkaar ko aainaa dikhaate hue dutt ne pradarshit kiya ki akaal ke baavjood aisa koi saal nahin tha jab sari fasalen chaupat ho gayi hon
 Grain was always full in government warehouses
 ek praant main agar fasal karaab ho gayi ho, to duusare praant main fasal acchhee hui
 Farming has expanded, it has become denser, yields have also increased compared to earlier, prices of agricultural produce have also increased, but even after this the condition of farmers has continued to deteriorate
 iske liye dutt ne british nitiyon ko zimmedaar tehraaya
 In 1902, the first volume of Dutt's great treatise 'the Economic History of British India' was published
 ise british hukumat par likhe gayi sabase behtareen granth kii sangya di jaati he
 In this, economic history was introduced from the establishment of British power in 1757 till the emperor's rule was implemented
 isamen east india company ke tahat apanaayi gayi kheti or bhoomi bandobast sambandhi nitiyon, vyapaar or kaarkaanaa utpaadan sambandhi nitiyon ke saath-saath vitt or prashasan sambandhi nitiyon kaa vishleshnatmak vivaran tha
 British reviewers of the book also considered its impartiality and depth iron
 1904 main is mahagranth kaa doosraa khand prakashit hua
 He claimed on the basis of authentic facts that selfish policies adopted in the early years of British rule have been responsible for the decline of Indian industries
 dutt ne bharat main garibi ke kaarnon par prakaash daalate hue sabit kiya ki angrezon kii niti ke kaaran deshi udyog or hastkalaon ko tabah ho janaa padaa
 Millions of people became unemployed, leaving no other option but to live for them
 is tarah kheti ke bharose jivit rahane waalon kii sankhya had se zyaada bad gayi or sabhi ke rahan-sahan kaa str gir gaya
 Along with this, the British continued to spend huge money to rule India, which did not benefit the country
 rajkoshiya niti or bhu-rajasav pranali kuch is tarah kii banaayi gayi ki kisaan ke paas sirf zindaa bache rahane laayak sansaadhan hi rah gayi
 Dutt also had a prescription for curing these problems
 unhone sifaarish kii ki bhartiya mil udyog se utpaadan shulk hataa liya jaae, nichi daron ke naram lagaan ke alaava baaki sabhi taxon se kisaanon ko chhutkaaraa diya jaae, england main hone vaali faujee or shahi karch bharat se nahin vasule jane chahie or bharat main bhi faujee karch ghataaye jane chahie
 As soon as Dutt made these suggestions, the British government and its supporters started criticizing them all-round
 unke tathyon or vishleshan ko kaarij karne kii koshish kii gayi
 It should be noted that Dutt was a senior officer of Indian Civil Services and was bound by the responsibility of serving British rule
 lekin, apni baat par jame rah kar unhone apane virodhiyon ke saath bahes kii or sarkaar se lagaataar anurodh kiya ki vah bharat kii aarthik dasha main sudhaar ke liye nitiyaan badale
 His unique talent was not limited only to administrative work, but he was also an original writer and historian
 apane lekhankaal ke aarambh main inhone angreji main likhaa, par baad main bankimchandra ke prabhaav se banglaa main bhi rachana kii

 Daulatnagar is located in the Sadat block of Ghazipur district, it is in the east of the Sadat railway station, in the north of the village is the temple of Shitala Ma - the post of the village is home to the office of Manabodh Chaubey, here is the temple of Kali Ma, Baram Baba and Mari Ma rani avantibai bharat ke pratham swadhinata sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaali virangana thim
 In the revolution of 1857, Rani Avantibai of Ramgarh was the architect of the liberation movement in Revanchal
 1857 ke mukti andolan main is rajya kii ahm bhoomika thi, jisase itihaas jagat anbhigya he
 The ruler of the Ramgarh state from 1817 to 1851 was Laxman Singh
 unke nidhan ke baad vikramaditya singh ne rajgaddi sanbhali
 He was married in his childhood to Avant Bai, the daughter of Rao Jujhar Singh, a zamindar of Mankehani
 vikramaditya singh bachapan se hi vitaragi pravriti ke the or puja-paath evam dharmik anushthanon main lage rahete
 Thus, his wife Rani Avantibai continued to do the work of the state
 unke do putr hue-amaan singh or sher singh
 By then the British had set their feet in many parts of India
 ramgarh ke raja vikramajit singh ko veikshipt tathaa amaan singh or sher singh ko naaballig ghoshit kar ramgarh rajya ko hadapney kii drushti se angrej shaskaon ne "court of wards" kii kaarywahi kii evam rajya ke prashasan ke liye sarbrahakaar niyukt kar shaikh mohammad tathaa mohammad abdulla ko ramgarh bheja
 "whereby the state of Ramgarh came into possession of the" Court of Wards "
 angrej shaskaon kii is hadap niti kaa parinaam bhi rani jaanati thi, phir bhi donon sarbrahakaaron ko unhone ramgarh se baahar nikaal diya
 In 1855 AD, Raja Vikramaditya Singh died in an accident
 ab naaballig putron kii sangrakshika ke rup main rajya shakti rani ke haathon aa gayi
 The queen ordered the farmers of the state not to obey the instructions of the British, this reform work increased the popularity of the queen

 "the letter was a symbol of harmony and solidarity, and the bangles became a powerful medium for making effort
 pudiya lene kaa arth tha angrejon ke viruddh kranti main apana samarthan dena
 Revolution had started in some areas of the country
 1857 main 52veen deshi paidal sena jabalpur sainik kendra kii sabase badi shakti thi
 On 18 June, a soldier of this army made a fatal attack on an officer of the English army
 july 1857 main mandla ke parganadaar umrao singh thakur ne kar dene se inkaar kar diya or is baat kaa prachaar karne laga ki angrejon kaa rajya samaapt ho gaya
 The British called the rebels as bandits and robbers
 mandla ke dipti kamishnar wadington ne major iskain se sena kii maang kii
 Rebels stirred up the entire Mahakaushal region
 gupt sabhaayen or prasad kii pudiyon kaa vitaran chalata rahaa
 Meanwhile, the death penalty given to King Shankarshah and Prince Raghunath Shah caused widespread reaction to the brutality of the British
 ve is kshetra ke rajyavansh ke pratik the
 Its first reaction was in Ramgarh
 ramgarh ke senapati ne bhua bichhiya thana main chadhaai kar di
 Due to which the soldiers of the police station left the police station and the rebels took control of the police station
 rani ke sipaahiyon ne ghughari par chadhaai kar us par apana adhikaar kar liya or vahaan ke talukedaar dhan singh kii suraksha ke liye umrao singh ko jimmedaari saunpi
 Some soldiers of Ramgarh and zamindars of Mukas also reached Jabalpur and closed the jabalpur-mandla road

 Avanti Bai departed with soldiers for Mandla victory
 rani kii soochna praapt hone par shahpura or mukaas ke jameendaar bhi mandla kii or ravaanaa hue
 Before reaching Mandla, the soldiers of Khaddevara also met the soldiers of Rani

 Waddington could not do anything after exerting full power and left the mandala and ran towards the suture
 is prakaar puraa mandla jila evam ramgarh rajya swatantra ho gaya
 After this victory, the power of the agitators decreased, but the enthusiasm did not decrease
 rani ramgarh waapas ho gayi
 Waddington again departed for Ramgarh

 English forces demolished the Ramgarh Fort and took control of Ramgarh
 dilli, aadhikarik taur par rashtriya rajdhani kshetra dilli bharat kaa ek centre-shasit pradesh or mahanagar he
 It includes New Delhi which is the capital of India

 Delhi has historical significance in India
 iske dakshin pashchim main aravali pahadiyaan or purv main yamuna nadi he, jiske kinare yah basaa he
 This was the main stop in the ancient times in the path of the commercial paths going through the Gangetic plain
 yamuna nadi ke kinare sthit is nagar kaa gauravshaalee puranic itihaas he
 It is the oldest city of India
 iske itihaas kaa prarambh sindhu ghati sabhyataa se judaa hua he
 The excavations in the surrounding areas of Haryana have provided evidence of this fact
 mahabharat kaal main iskaa naam indraprastha tha
 With the rise of Delhi Sultanate, Delhi emerged as a major political, cultural and commercial city
 yahan kai pracheen evam madhyakaalin imaaraton tathaa unke avasheshon ko dekha ja saktaa hai
 In 1639, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan built a boundary wall surrounded by Delhi, which was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1679 to 1857
 18veen evam 19veen shatabdi main british east india company ne lagbhag puure bharat ko apane kabje main le liya
 These people made Kolkata their capital
 1911 main angreji sarkaar ne faisla kiya ki rajdhani ko waapas dilli laayaa jaae
 For this, construction of a new city New Delhi to the south of Old Delhi started
 angrejon se 1947 main swatantraaa praapt kar nai dilli ko bharat kii rajdhani ghoshit kiya gaya
 After the independence, there was a migration of people from different areas in Delhi, this led to a complete change in the appearance of Delhi
 vibhinn pranto, dharmon evam jatiyon ke logon ke dilli main basane ke kaaran dilli kaa shaharikaran to hua hi saath hi yahan ek mishrit samskruti ne bhi janm liya
 Today Delhi is a major political, cultural and commercial center of India
 is nagar kaa naam "dilli" kaise padaa iskaa koi nishchit sandarbh nahin miltaa, lekin vyapak rup se yah mana gaya he ki yah ek pracheen raja "dhillu" se sambandhit he
 Some historians believe that it is a distorted form of dehli, which means 'chowkhat' in Hindustani, indicating that this city is probably the gateway to the indus-ganga Samabhoomi
 ek or anumaan ke anusaar is nagar kaa praarambhik naam "dhilika" tha
 Hindi / Prakrit "loose" was also used for this region
 dilli kaa pracheenatam ullekh mahabharat naamak mahapurana main miltaa he jahaan iskaa ullekh pracheen indraprastha ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Indraprastha was the capital of the Pandavas during the Mahabharata period
 puratathvik rup se jo pehle pramaan mili hai usase pataa chalata he ki isa se do hajaar varsh pehle bhi dilli tathaa uske aas-paas maanav nivas karte the
 a city started to develop here from the Mauryan period
 maharaj prithviraj chouhan ke darbari kavi chand bardaai kii hindi rachana prithviraj raso main tomars raja anangpal ko dilli kaa sansthaapak bataaya gaya he
 It is believed that he built the 'lal-kot' and brought Mehrauli's secret carpet iron pillar to Delhi
 dilli main tomaron kaa shasankaal varsh 900-1200 tak mana jaataa he
 The use of the word 'delhi' or 'delhi' was first found on inscriptions found in Udaipur
 is shilaalekh kaa samay varsh 1170 nirdhaarit kiya gaya
 Maharaj Prithviraj Chauhan is considered the last Hindu emperor of Delhi
 1206 i0 ke baad dilli dilli sultanate kii rajdhani bani
 It was ruled by some other dynasties including the Khalji dynasty, the Tughlaq dynasty, the Syed dynasty and the Lodhi dynasty
 aisa mana jaataa he ki aaj kii aadhunik dilli banane se pehle dilli saat baar ujadi or vibhinn sthanon par basii, jinke kuch avshesh aadhunik dilli main ab bhi dekhe ja sakate hai
 The then rulers of Delhi changed its form many times
 mughal badshaah humayun ne sarhind ke nikat yuddh main afagaanon ko parajeet kiya tathaa bina kisi virodh ke dilli par adhikaar kar liya
 After Humayun's death, the Afghans under the leadership of Hemu Vikramaditya defeated the Mughal army and regained control of Agra and Delhi
 mughal badshaah akbar ne apni rajdhani ko dilli se agra sthantarit kar diya
 Akbar's grandson Shah Jahan settled it for the seventh time in the middle of the seventeenth century, which was called as Shahjahanabad
 shahjahanabad ko aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa main purana shahar yaa puraani dilli kaha jaataa he
 Since ancient times, many kings and emperors have ruled over Old Delhi and its name was also changed from time to time
 puraani dilli 1638 ke baad mogul samraaton kii rajdhani rahi
 The last Mughal emperor of Delhi was Bahadur Shah Zafar, who died in Rangoon in Nirvasan itself
 1857 ke sipaahi vidroh ke baad dilli par british shashan ke hukumat main shashan chalane laga
 After completely suppressing the movement of this first Indian freedom struggle of 1857, the British sent Bahadur Shah Zafar to Rangoon and India became completely under the British
