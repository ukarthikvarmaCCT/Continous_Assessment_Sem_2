 His first available writing is his Urdu novel Asrar Maabid
 premchand kaa doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 This was followed by Premchand's first story collection called soze-watan which was published in 1908
 soje-vatan yani desh kaa dard
 Fueled by patriotism, it was banned by the English government and warned its author not to do such writing in future
 iske kaaran unhen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa
 His first story titled 'premchand' was published in the December 1910 issue of Bada Ghar Ki Beti Zamana magazine
 maranoparant unki kahaniyaan maansarovar naam se 8 khandon main prakashit hui
 The story said that Emperor Premchand said that the litterateur is not the truth behind patriotism and politics, but rather the truth which shows the torch before him
 yah baat unke sahitya main ujagar hui he
 In 1921, he quit his job at the call of Mahatma Gandhi
 kuch maheene maryaada patrika kaa sampadan bhaar sambhala, chah saal tak maadhuri naamak patrika kaa sampadan kiya, 1930 main banaras se apana masik patr hans shuru kiya or 1932 ke aarambh main jaagran naamak ek saptahik or nikaala

 Wrote the story of a film titled Mazdoor, released in 1934, and without completing the year-long period of contract, escaped to Benares, leaving two months' salary because he did not like the air and water of the film world in Bombay and more
 unhone mul rup se hindi main 1915 se kahaniyaan likhnaa or 1918 se upanyaas likhnaa shuru kiya
 Premchand wrote a total of nearly three hundred stories, about a dozen novels and many articles
 unhone kuch naatak bhi likhe or kuch anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Many literary works of Premchand were translated into many languages including English, Russian, German
 godaan unki kaaljayi rachana he
 Kafan is believed to be his final story
 unhone hindi or urdu main puure adhikaar se likhaa
 Most of his compositions originally written in Urdu, but they went first publication was in Hindi
 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit
 Premchand's composition and vision came in various literary forms
 bahumukhi pratibha sampann premchand ne upanyaas, kahani, naatak, samiksha, lekh, sampadakeey, sansmaran aadi anek vidhaon main sahitya kii sristi kii
 He was prominently known as a storyteller and during his lifetime he was awarded the title of 'novel Emperor'
 unhone kul 15 upanyaas, 300 se kuch adhik kahaniyaan, 3 naatak, 10 anuwaad, 7 bal-pustaken tathaa hajaaron prishthon ke lekh, sampadakeey, bhaashan, bhoomika, patr aadi kii rachana kii lekin jo yash or pratishtha unhen upanyaas or kahaniyon se praapt hui, vah anya vidhaon se praapt na ho saki
 This situation appears equally in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 premchand ke upanyaas na keval hindi upanyaas sahitya main balki sampurna bhartiya sahitya main mile ke pathar hai
 Premchand first begins his novelist in fiction
 unka pehla urdu upanyaas ‘asaraare maaabid urf devsthan rahasy’ urdu saptahik ‘'aawaaj-e-khalq'’ main 8 oktober, 1903 se 1 farvari, 1905 tak dharawahik rup main prakashit hua
 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute
 dow ramvilas sharma ke anusaar 'sevasadan' main vyakt mukhya samasya bhartiya nari kii paradheenata he
 After this came his first novel 'premashram' on peasant life
 iskaa masauda bhi pehle urdu main 'goshaae-aafiyat' naam se taiyaar hua tha lekin 'sevasadan' kii bhaanti ise pehle hindi main prakashit karaayaa
 'premashram' is probably the first novel in Hindi written on peasant life
 yah avadh ke kisaan andolanon ke daur main likhaa gaya
 After this, the journey through 'rangbhoomi', 'rejuvenation', 'nirmala', 'drone', 'karmabhoomi' was completed to 'godan'
 rangabhumi main premchand ek andhe bhikhaari surdaas ko katha kaa nayak banaakar hindi katha sahitya main krantikari badlaav kaa sutarapaat kar chuke the
 Godan has an important place not only in Hindi literature but also in world literature
 isamen premchand kii sahitya sambandhi vichaardhaara 'aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad' se 'aalochanatmak yatharthwaad' tak kii purnataa praapt karti he
 Creating a common peasant hero of the novel was like to change the course of the novel tradition
 samantvaad or poonjeevaad ke chakra main funskar hui kathanayake hori kii mrityu pathakon ke jahan ko jhakzor kar rakh jaati he
 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 This can also be seen in his last period stories
 'mangalsutra' premchand kaa adhuraa upanyaas he
 The original story of Premchand's novels was Indian rural life
 premchand ne hindi upanyaas ko jo oonchaai pradaan kii, vah parvarti upanyaaskaaron ke liye ek chunauti bani rahi
 Premchand's novels were translated into many languages of India and the world, especially his most popular novel Godan

 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya

 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya
 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill

 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe
 Most of Premchand's compositions tell the story of his poverty and poverty

 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement
 premchand ne hindi main kahani kii ek parampara ko janm diya or ek puri peedi unke kadamon par aage badi, 50-60 ke dashak main renu, nagarjun auki inke baad shrinath singh ne gramin parivesh kii kahaniyaan likhi hai, wo ek tarah se premchand kii parampara ke taratamya main aati hai
 Premchand was a revolutionary creator, he saw not only patriotism but also many evil practices prevalent in the society and put them before the people through the story
 unhone us samay ke samaaj kii jo bhi samasyaayen thim un sabhi ko chitrit karne kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 Dalits also come in it, women also
 ye sabhi vishay aage chalakar hindi sahitya ke bade vimarsh bane

 dhamaar kaa janm braj bhoomi ke lok sangeet main hua
 Its practice as a folk song in the area of braj goes back to many times
 is loakgeet main varnya- vishay radha- krishna ke holi khilne kaa tha
 Ras was adorned and the language was Braj
 graamon ke unmookt vaataavaran main drut gati ke dipachandi, dhumali or kabhi addha jaisi taal main yuvak- yuvatiyon, praudh or vridhon, sabhi ke dwaara yah loakgeet gaae or naache jate the

 pandrahavin shatabdi ke ant or solahavin shatabdi ke prarambh main us samay ke sangeet paridrishy ko dekhte hue maansingh tomars or nayak baiju ne dhamaar gayaki kii neenv daali
 He took the folk song of Braj named Hori and molded it in the fire of knowledge
 pracheen charchari prabandh ke saanche main, jo charchari taal main hi gaae jate the
 Adi Chachar became the favorite rhythm of Hori singing
 hori kii bandish to purvavat rahi, vah vibhinn raagon main nibaddh kar di gai
 The singing style moves from the predetermined rhythm to the Kaharwa rhythm at the first delayed end based on the same folk music and enchants the listener
 nayak baiju ne dhamaron kii rachana choti kii
 Its singing style was based on the same as Dhruvapada
 varnya-vishay maatr phag se sambandhit or ras shringaar tha, vah bhi sanyog
 Disposition Shringar holds very few places
 is style kaa uddeshy hi romantic vaataavaran utpann karnaa tha
 Alap, like Dhruvapada, was then sung
 pad gayan ke baad lay- baant pradhan upaj hoti thi
 The singer used to amaze the audience with a variety of rhythms
 pakhaavji ke saath ladnt hoti thi
 Even the breath was used
 shreshth kalakaar gey padaanshon ke swar sanniveshon main bhi antar karke shrotaaon ko rasmagn karte the
 Thus Dhamar was born and this singing style spread to musicians across the country
 gat ek shatabdi main dhamaar ke shreshth gayak narayan shasri, dharmadas ke putr baharaam khan, pan lakshmanadas, giddhaur vaale mohammad ali khan, alam khan, agre ke gulam abbaas khan or udaipur ke dagar bandhu aadi hue hai

 veena main dhruvapadanurup aalaap, jodalap, vilambit lay kii gaten, taan, paranen or jhaalaa aadi bajaae gaye
 According to Dhamar, the battle of rhythm-sharing started with Pakhawaji
 pakhaavji ne bhi dhruvpad- dhamaar main prayukt taalon main bhi abhyaas kiya, saath hi sangat ke liye vibhinn taalon or layon kii paranon ko rachaa

 Where the supply is of alternating current, it is necessary to convert it into direct current
 yah dishtakaari athwa motor-janitr samucchy dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Before an object is electrified, it is cleaned thoroughly
 usapar kisi prakaar kaa tel padaarth, greej, athwa dhul ke kan nahin hone chahie, anyathaa lepan pukhta nahin hoga
 Some chemical solutions are also used for cleaning, and after washing, the coated material is added to a dilute solution of sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid to remove metallic oxides
 iske pashchaat vah vastu lepan kiye jane ke liye cathod ke rup main lepan vath main lataka di jaati he
 a coating bath is usually in the form of a dielectric tank, filled with a chemical solution of the metal to be coated
 tamra lepan ke liye, yah vilyan tamra salphet kaa hota he

 If an active metal is added to a solution of a metal compound in which ions are abundant, the dissociation action occurs
 aise lepan tikaoo nahin hote
 There is the same difficulty in applying silver or gold on copper or brass
 The composition of chemical solutions used in these are very balanced
 lepan vath main, saamanyat:, ek or yogic, jise yojit kaarak kehete hai, milaayaa jaataa he
 Glue, gelatin, albumin, etc
 are commonly used additive factors
 tamra lepan main tamra sulphate ke sthaan par tamra synide kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he
 It is often used to give the first copper casing on steel and later nickel or chromium is coated on the copper casing
 tamra lepan main bhi pehle tamra synide dwaara pehla aavaran dene ke pashchaat doosraa aavaran tamra salphet dwaara diya jaataa he
 Typically, some sodium thiosulfate is also added to the lapan bath to create shine
 achche or tikaoo lepan ke liye dhara ghanatv lagbhag 100 ampiore prati varg meter hota he
 Experience is the main criterion in this subject

 purv bane gija kii mahaan pyramid kaa parimaap 1760 cubit or oonchai 280 cubit thi; jiskaa anupaat 1760 / 280 ≈ 6
2857 pai ke maan ke lagbhag 2 guna he
 Based on this ratio, some Egyptologists believe that the builders of the pyramids had knowledge of π and deliberately built pyramids incorporating the properties of the circle
 anya maton ke anusaar π se sambandhit uparokt suzav keval sanyog he, kyonki iskaa koi pramaan uplabddh nahin he ki pyramid banane waalon ko π ke bare main jaankaree thi or chunki pyramid kii vimaayein anya karkon par bhi nirbhar karti hai
 The earliest written approximations of π are found in Egypt and Babylon, both measurements with an accuracy of 1 percent

 paashchaatya kavyashastra ke udbhav ke sakshya isa ke aath shatabdi purv se milane lagate hai
 The earliest points of Western poetic thinking are found in the poetry of great poets like Homer and Hesiod
 isapurv yunaan main vaktrutvshastriyon kaa kaafii mahatva tha
 From the point of view, some of the dramatics such as Phrags and Clouds of that time are quite important and remarkable
 frags main kavita ko lekar yah prashn kiya gaya he ki vah utkrisht kyon maani jaati he? kavy samaaj ko upyogi prerana tathaa manoranjan ke kaaran mahatvapurn hai yaa anand pradaan karne tathaa manoranjan ke kaaran? is tarah se kavyashastreey chintan-sutara unani samaaj main bahut pehle maujuud rahe or vidhivat kavy-samiksha kii shuruyaat plato se hui
 Plato proposed the principle of social utility of poetry
 uske anusaar kavy ko udaatt maanav-mulyon kaa prasar karnaa chahie
 Praise and praise of gods and heroes should be the main subject of poetry
 kavy-charitra aise hone chahie jinka anukaran karke adarsh naagarikta praapt kii ja sake
 When Plato reviewed the poetry he had received till his time, he was deeply disappointed to see that poetry was based on imagination
 vah nagarikon ko uttamottam prerana evam vichaar dene ke bajaay durbal banaati he
 Plato's thought that it would not be right to place imaginative poets in a well-organized state, because such artists tend to frustrate a person's reasoning by raising false emotionality, thereby ending the conscience of good and evil
 plato ke kala or kavy-sambandhi vivechan se saundaryashastreey evam kavyashastreey chintan main anukriti-siddhant kaa samavesh hua
 According to him, poetry, literature and art are imitations of life and nature in some form
 kavy ko kala kaa hi ek rup maanane vaale plato ke anusaar kavi or kalakaar anukaran karte hue mul vastu yaa charitron ke bimbon or drishyon kii pratimurti upasthit karte hai
 They do not have knowledge of the reality of that object or character
 kalaon or kavitaaon ko nimna koti kaa maanane vaale plato anukaran ke do paksh maanate hai— pehla jiskaa anukaran kiya jaataa he or doosraa anukaran kaa swaroop
 If the element of imitation is auspicious and imitation is complete and good, then it is welcome
 parantu praayah anukrity vastu amangalakaari hoti he tathaa kabhi-kabhi maganlakaari vastu kaa anukaran adhuraa or apurna hota he
 In such a situation, art is beyond truth and harmful
 aage chalakar plato ke shishy arestu ne kalaon ko anukaranaatmak maanate hue bhi unke mahatva ko sweekaar kiya
 This was a different vision from Plato's ideas
 plato ke vichaar jahaan naitik or saamaajik hai, vahiin arestu kii drushti saundaryavaadee he
 He presented the theory of devolution
 is siddhant ke anusaar gambheer kaaryon kii safal or prabhaavshaalee anukriti varnan ke rup main na hokar kaaryon ke rup main hoti he jisamen karunaa or bhay utpann karne vaali ghatnaayen hoti hai jo in bhaavon ke rechan dwaara ek raahat or anand pradaan karti hai
 Aristotle's thoughts are condensed into our two expressions of fear and compassion
 is prakaar kii traasadee ko dekhne par kushal abhinay dwaara ye bhav santulit or samanjit ho jate hai or is prakaar hamaare man ko raahat or anand kii anubhuti hoti he
 These incited lusts and its ill effects between the characters of the poem or drama have no direct connection to our body and life, and these lusts take the form of sophisticated sensations
 yahi bhaavon kaa virechan he or kavita kaa yahi vaastavik prabhaav or kaary hota he
 Aristotle said that poetry is based on imagination
 vah vaastaviktaa kaa chithran nahin hota balki uskaa aadhaar sambhaavna he
 Poetry is actually a simulation but that is its specialty
 lekin kavi vastuon kii punarrachana karata he, nakal nahin
 Poetry is enjoyable because of simulation
 usase shiksha praapt ho sakati he kintu uskaa uddeshy shiksha pradaan karnaa nahin he
 Aristotle thus defied Plato's poetic ideas and accusations
 plato or arestu ke baad unani kavy-samiksha ke kshetra main ek pratinidhi kavyashastri lonzinus kaa naam bhi pramukhataa se aata he
 He propounded the principle of orthodoxy
 lonzinus ke is siddhant kii avadharana ne saahityetar itihaas, darshan or dharm jaise vishyon ko bhi apane antargat samaveshit kiya
 According to him, Oudatya Vani has its height, radiance and specialness due to which great poets, historians, philosophers have received the honor and fame
 isi se unki kritiyaan garimamay bani hai or unka prabhaav yug-ugantar tak pratishthit ho sakaa he
 He considered 'sublime' as the main element of poetry
 unke anusaar vichaaron kii udaattata, bhaavon kii udaattata, alankaaron kii udaattata, shabd-vinyas kii udaattata tathaa vaakya-vinyas kii udaattata kisi bhi kavy ko shreshth banaati he
 a great poem brings joy to the people and delivers it to the divine world
 is siddhant ne paashchaatya jagat ko kaafii prabhavit kiya
 Gradually the Greek review began to weaken over time and the influence of the Roman review increased
 rome kala, sahitya or samskruti sambandhi vichaar-vimarsh kaa centre bana
 Critics such as Cicero and Virgil contributed significantly to Western poetry
 horess ne kaha ki- kavy main saamanjasy or auchity kaa hona aavashyak he
 In poetry, there should be a co-ordination of the ancient and the new with the harmony of the best ideas
 kavy ke bhavapaksh tathaa kalapaksh donon kii utkrushtataa ke prati kavi ko sajag tathaa prayatnsheel hona chahie
 The period from the fifth to the fifteenth century is considered blind in terms of Western poetry
 is dauraan carch or padariyon ke prabhaav ke kaaran kavy tathaa samiksha buree tarah se prabhavit hui
 In poetry, subtleties were given more importance
 is kaal ke kavyashastriyon main dante pramukh hai
 Their time is believed to be between 1265 and 1391
 unhone garimamandit stareey jan- bhashaa ko kavy ke liye sabase upyukt mana
 In poetry, Dante, a native of public language, said that with talent, diligence and practice are also necessary for the poet
 unke mutabik ucch vichaar, raashtra-prem, manavprem or saundaryaprem kavy ko mahatva pradaan karte hai
 The medieval review became didactic under the influence of the church and the clergy
 rinesaan yaa punarjagran kaal main sidney or ben johnson ne use mukt karaayaa
 Sydney said that poetry has been the medium of propagation of knowledge since ancient times and its usefulness will remain in every situation
 kavy kaa uddeshy sadacharan kii shiksha dene ke saath hi anand pradaan karata he
 Imitation of nature does not mean copying but presenting it in the grandest form and creating affection for nature
 uskaa vaastavik arth srujanshiltaa he
 Ben Johnson, another famous critic of the same period, emphasized the subsistence of materiality and underlined the imitation and practice of classic literature
 satrahavin or attharahavin shatabdi ke bich ke samay ko navyashastravaadi samiksha ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to its installations, advanced ideas in literature should be serious
 sahitya main upadeshaatmakataa, apekshit sahitya rachana ke liye abhyaas tathaa adhyayan kaa mahatva hota he
 Wisdom and logic have more importance than the heart
 is samiksha ke antargat utkrisht pracheen sahitya ke adhyayan kii abhiruchi, puraatan saahitiyik mandandon ke paalan, sahitya ke vahya paksh kii utkrushtataa tathaa kalatmak saushthav par bal diya gaya
 In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Romanticism gained momentum, and poets such as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats introduced the Regulatory Review Theory of Romanticism through Romantic poetry
 iske tahat kavy main kavi-kalpana ko mahatva pradaan kiya gaya
 More emphasis on the expression of self-realization and the emotional side of poetry was kept in the center
 kavy kaa uddeshy swantahsukhaay tathaa anand maanate hue svachhndathawadi kavy main prerana, pratibha tathaa kalpana ko pramukhataa mili
 This review principle entailed objectivity and factuality
 sahitya kii naveenta, pracheen saahitiyik mandandon, paramparaon tathaa roodhiyon ko nakaarne kii pravriti tathaa shilpagat naveenta aadi ke aagrah ke kaaran yarthathwaad kaa kaafii vikaas hua or aage chalakar isi ke garbh se pragativaad, samaajawaadee yarthathwaad tathaa manovaigyanik yarthathwaad kaa vikaas hua
 According to this art is for art
 rachana kisi siddhi ke liye nahin hoti
 Ethics, preaching or entertainment is not the purpose of poetry but it is self-evident
 iske antargat anubhuti kii moulikta evam naveenta par vishesh jor rahaa
 While rendering this theory, Benedito Croche said that poetic style is important rather than poetic object
 arth kii apeksha shabd mahatvapurn hai
 And the beauty of poetry depends not on the subject but on the style
 abhivyanjana hi kavy kaa kavyatatva he
 In the second half of the nineteenth century, Badlair, Melarme, Burlen, and Valéry, etc
 reinforced symbolism
 1886 main kavi jyaan moreas ne figaaro naamak patr main pratikwaad kaa ghoshnaptr prakashit kiya
 This review community stated the importance of words in poetry and said that poetry is written by words and not by thoughts
 kavy sarsaadhaaran ke liye nahin balki use samaj sakane vaale logon ke liye hota he
 The poet is committed to his soul, not to anyone else
 shabd anubhutiyon or vichaaron ke pratik hote hai
