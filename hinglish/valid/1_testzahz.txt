 This is from the state of West Bengal
 rajya sabha ke vartmaan sadasyon kii suchi main bhartiya vidhayika ke rajya sabha ke saansad kii suchi he
 Cities written in bold letters are also the capital of their state or union territory

 yatharthwaad se taatpary us vichaardhaara se he jo ki us vastu evam bhautik jagat ko satya maanati he, jiskaa ham gyanendriyon dwaara pratyaksh anubhav karte hai
 Animals, birds, humans, water, sky, etc
, we can explain everything, so all these are true, real
 yatharthwaad, jaisaa yah sansar he vaisaa hi saamanytah use sweekaar karata he
 Realism is an ideology contrary to idealism, but it has a lot to do with naturalism and puritanism
 yatharthwaad kisi ek sugathit darshanik vichaardhaara kaa naam na hokar un sabhi vichaaron kaa pratinidhitiv karata he jo yah maanate hai ki vastu kaa astitv hamaare gyaan par nirbhar karata he kintu yatharthwaad vichaarak maanate hai ki vastu kaa swatantra astitv he, chaahe vah hamaare anubhav main ho athwa nahin
 Both the object and the knowledge related to it are different entities
 vishwa main anek aisi vasteen hai jinke vishay main hamen koi gyaan nahin hota parantu iskaa arth yah nahin he ki ve vasteen astitv main nahin hai
 Knowledge always increases
 jagat kaa sampoorn rahasy maanav gyaan kii seemaa main kabhi nahin aa saktaa
 This is to say that the object has independent status whether man has knowledge of it or not
 vyakti kaa gyaan use vastu kii sthiti se avgat karaata he, parantu vastu kii sthiti kaa gyaan manushya ko na ho to vastu kaa astitv nasht nahin hota
 According to realism, our experience determines the response to external substances rather than independent
 anubhav vahya jagat se prabhavit he or vahya jagat kaa vaastavik satta he
 According to realism, man should have knowledge of environment
 use yah pataa hona chahie ki vah vaataavaran ko parivartit kar saktaa he athwa nahin or isi gyaan ke anusaar use kaary karnaa chaiye
 The new form of realism is scientific realism, which is known today as 'realism'
 vaigyanik yathartwaadiyon ne darshan kii samasyaon ko sulajhane main vishesh ruchi pradarshit nahin kii
 According to him, the reality is flowing
 yah parivartansheel he or iske kisi nishchit rup ko jaananaa asambhav he
 Therefore, he envisages that reality is not a product of the human mind
 satya maanav mastishk kii dein he
 Reality is an object beyond human mind
 us yatharth ke prati drushtikon viksit karnaa satya kaha jaayegaa
 The closer the truth is to reality, the more true it will be
 yatharthwaad ek aisi vichaardhaara he jiskaa bijaropan maanav mastishk main ati pracheen kaal main hi ho gaya tha, jabaki vah apane chaaron ore ke vaataavaran kii vastuon se prabhavit hokar unheen ko yatharth maan letaa he
 According to Butler - 'for a large number of people, the world is the undisputed reality
 yadi uski yatharthata ke sambandh main poocha jaay to sheeghra hi uttar praapt hoga ki vastav main yah jagat yatharth he
 We will all accept this attitude by accepting the external form of the world in unnatural moments of unknown action and vice
 yahan tak ki adarshavaadi vichaarak apane anadhikrut kshanon main is prakaar kii akrutrimata ke doshi hai, aisa yathartwaadiyon kaa kathan he
 But as far as the scientific form of realism is concerned, we can say that the realist ideology which was unconsciously planted in the human mind long ago, it originated at the end of the 16th century, which by the time of reaching the 17th century was very clear
 Gone
 apane vikaas kram main yatharthwaad pracheen kaal se aadhunik kaal tak anek roopon main upasthit hua
 According to ancient realism, there were two forms of creation - is prakaar bauddhiktavaadi yatharthwaad ne dwaitvaad kaa samarthan kiya he
 According to intellectual realism, there is no change in the divine world, so there is no question of education there
 siikhnaa keval prakritik jagat main hi sambhav he, divine jagat main nahin
 There were two major reasons for the emergence of realism - first, the idealistic ideology that had been going on since ancient times till the 16th century and became hollow and second, the development of science
 solahavin shatabdi tak lagbhag sabhi pracheen tathaa madhyakaalin adarsh mahatvaheen ho chuke the
 They had no faith because they were not useful for the present human life
 ve manushya kii saamaanya aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne main asamarth the
 They could develop mental but could not generate action and practicality in humans
 pracheen adarsh samay kii maang ko puraa karne main asamarth the, isliye manushya aise adarsh kii maang karne laga jo vaastavik jivan vyateet karne main sahaayak ho
 As a result, there was a resurgence period in the medieval period after monasticism and scholasticism
 punarutthan kaal ke is yug main manushya main ek aisi lahar utpann ho gayi ki paralok ke bajaay maanviya gunon kaa vikaas karnaa maanav jati kaa pradhan lakshya ho gaya
 This resulted in the emergence of 'humanism' and gradually Humanism was converted to Ciceroism as the writing style of Cicer became the main goal of his life
 iske uparant –'sudhaarkaal' kaa janm hua
 As a result of humanism and reformism, man began to believe in 'intellect' and 'conscience' and tried to understand all things on the basis of them
 unke vishwaas ko or adhik drudh vigyaan ke vikaas ne kiya jo yatharthwaad ke janm kaa doosraa mahatvapurn kaaran he
 The researches of Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, John Kepler, Harvies, Bacon, etc
 resulted in the narrowing of the human outlook and blind faith
 vaigyanik yug kaa armbh hua or is yug ne ‘buddhi’ evam vivek’ ko adhik pradhanta di tathaa manushya kaa dhyaan vaastaviktaa kii ore aakrisht kiya
 Thus realism was born from the incorporation of material philosophicalism and scientific tendency which negates the power of the hereafter
 bhartiya darshan main nyaay evam vaisheshik darshan yatharthwaad ke samakaksh maane jate hai
 The originator of Nyaya Darshan was Gautama who was also famous by the name of Akshpad
 nyaay darshan main taarkik aalochana kaa aashray liya gaya he
 Like all other Indian philosophies, the aim of Nyaya Darshan is also to attain salvation, but to achieve this objective it is necessary to attain true knowledge
 nyaay darshan main pramaan kaa vishesh mahatv he
 This philosophy examines a subject through evidence to solve life's problems
 jiske dwaara prabhaa kii utpatti hoti he, use pramaan kehete hai
 Prabha means - real knowledge, real experience
 nyaay darshan ke anusaar yatharth gyaan chaar upayon se praapt kiya ja saktaa he, isliye pramaan bhi chaar maane gayi hai
 As direct, inference, syllables and words
 jo anubhav indriyon ke sanyog se praapt hota he or jiske vishay main sandeh kaa abhaav hota he tathaa jo yatharth bhi hota he use ‘pratyaksh’ kehete hai
 Knowing the substance that holds it for someone or with the knowledge of symptoms is called 'presumption'
 ‘upmaan’ ke dwaara naam evam nami kaa sambandh jaan jaataa he
 ‘gavay’ or Nilgai is similar to a normal cow
 isko sunakar jab koi vyakti 'go' arthath saamaanya gaay ke samaan pashu ko nilgai samajhane lagata he tab use ‘upmaan’ dwaara praapt gyaan kaha jaataa he
 Evidence is not accepted in the Charvak philosophy
 ‘shabd’ nyaay darshan ke anusaar antim pramaan he
 We gain knowledge of substances by words and sentences
 yah gyaan shabd pramaan dwaara hota he
 That is why it is said - Aptopadesh: Word: That is the word proof of a man who has knowledge of reality
 vaisheshik darshan ke pravartak maharishi kanad ne dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh, samavaay evam abhaav in saat padaarthon par vichaar kiya he
 Justice and Vaiseshika have been called realistic here, but both believe in liberation
 apane vivechan main yah yathartwaadee drushtikon apanaate hai, isiilie inhen yatharthwaad kaha gaya he
 Syedism of Jain philosophy is also considered realistic
 syadawaad sahishnutaa evam vinitata kaa maarg he jo hamen chaatro main janatantratmak manovriti kaa vikaas karne kii prerana detaa he, saath hi dusron ke vichaaron ko sunanaa, duusare ke reeti rivaajon ko samajhnaa tathaa loktantr ke sanchaalan kii bhi shiksha detaa he
 Indian realism suggests adopting a realistic approach to life, but this does not mean that it calls God, soul etc
 unnecessary

 Omprakash Makhija is a junior artist in the Mumbai film industry in the 1970s
 vah or uskaa mitra pappu pramukh kalakaar banane ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai
 Om's mother, Bela Makhija, continues to encourage her son
 om ke dil kii dhadkan he-- desh kii sarvaadhik lokapriy film nayika, shantipriya 
 Omprakash gets two opportunities to approach Shantipriya
 pehla film 'drimigirl' ke premier par, jahaan om or pappu chaalaaki se ghus jate hai
 Another on the set of the film where Om saves Shanti from fire by playing on her life
 tab se om or shanti achche dost ban jate hai
 One day Om listens to the peace dispute with top producer Mukesh Mehra
 om ko yah jaanakar jhatka lagata he ki shanti mukesh se gupachup shaadi kar chuki he or garbhvatee he
 Mukesh is determined to keep his relations with Shanti a secret until his new film 'om Shanti Om' is completed
 shanti ko yah shaq he ki mukesh ek dhani vyavsaayee kii beti se vivaah kii yojana bana rahaa he
 She demands Mukesh his rights
 sab sunakar om kaa dil tut jaataa he
 One night, Mukesh takes Shanti to the set of the film 'om Shanti Om'
 vah kahata he ki vah film ko band kar degaa or saare samaaj ke saamne shanti se vivaah kar legaa
 But it turns out to be a trick of Mukesh
 vah shanti ko apni vittiya haani kaa kaaran samajhataa he
 So he sets the set on fire and leaves Shanti to die there
 om shanti ko bachaane kaa prayaas karata he par mukesh ke guard use aisa karne nahin dete
 Om falls away from the explosion and falls under a car
 us car kaa maalik rajesh kapur ek prasiddh abhinayta he jo apni garbhvatee patni lavali ko prasav ke liye aspataal le ja rahaa he
 Rajesh also takes Om to the hospital

 yah baccha omprakash makhija kaa punarjanm he
 In the new life, he is named Om Kapoor
 vayask hone par vah ek lokapriy film star "o ke" ban jaataa he
 He is very afraid of fire
 ek din kisi film kii shooting ke liye om us sthaan par jaataa he jahaan tees varsh pehle 'om shanti om' ke set main aag lagi thi
 Looking at the burnt set, memories of Om's past life begin to emerge
 phir ek party main om kaa saamana mukesh mehara se hota he jo is bich hollywood kaa safal film nirmaataa ban chukaa he
 On seeing him, Om remembers all the things of past life clearly
 tab uskaa bela or pappu se bhaavnaatmak punarmilan hota he
 Om Kapoor makes a plan together with Pappu, Bella and other companions to avenge Shanti's death
 om mukesh se tay karata he ki ve donon phir se 'om shanti om' film kaa nirmaan karenge
 Then Om and his assistant seek Shantipriya's lookalike
 unhen sandhyaa yaa 'sandy" naam kii yuvati milti he jo dekhne main shantipriya ke samaan or 'o ke' kii divaani he
 And then their plan begins - Om plays games with Mukesh
 sandy shanti ke rup main mukesh ke samane baar baar aati he
 Mukesh thinks that he is the soul of peace and starts to fear
 lekin phir ek din mukesh jaan jaataa he ki yah yuvati koi or he, shanti nahin
 He becomes alert
 ant main set par om or mukesh main hathapayee hoti he
 Om states that he was witness to the killing of Shanti by Mukesh in his previous birth
 mukesh use chunauti detaa he ki purvajanm kii baat par koi bhi adaalat vishwaas nahin karegi
 Just then, a young woman in the guise of peace comes there and says that just below the chandelier on the set, the proof of murder is buried - her body, which Mukesh had buried alive under the ground
 vah om ko mukesh par waar karne se roak detii he
 a heavy chandelier falls down and Mukesh gets subdued by it
 duusari ore se pappu ke saath sandy kamare main aa jaati he
 Om then realizes that Sandi, not the one who spoke the evidence, was the soul of the real Shantipriya, who avenged his killer
 shanti kii aatma om ko karun drushti se dekhakar muskuraati he or ojhal ho jaati he

 Lindelof and Cuse said that deciding the 2010 series finale date was "extremely liberating" and helped rediscover the center of the series
 lindelopha ne kaha, "ham ab or nahin roak rahe hai
 "the makers plan to end long-running secrets, including the nature of the smoking monster, the four-thumbed tower, the identity and religion of Adam and Eve from the Season 1 episode of House of the Rising Sun" The reason for continuing even after the abolition of topical

 shrinkhalaa ke rachanaakaar in tatwon ko shrinkhalaa kii puranic kathaon ko rachane ke liye prayog karte he or yah prashansako kii atakalon kaa aadhaar banate he

 siddhanton main mukhya rup se dweep kaa swaroop, 'rakshas'or "adars" kaa mul, ankon kaa matlab or durghatana kaa hona va kuch yatriyon ke bachane kaa kaaran shaamil he
 Some of the public fanfare has been discussed and rejected by the creators of the public theory program, with the most common being that the survivor of Oceanic Flight 815 is dead or in hell
 yah je je abramas dwaara vishesh rup se nakaar diya gaya tha
 In addition, Lindelof has ruled out speculation that the spacecraft or the inhabitants of another planet affect the events of the island or whether everything is happening in a person's imagination
 carlton kus ne is siddhant ko bhi kaarij kar diya jiske anusaar yah dweep par ek reality tivi kaarykram he or kalakaar bekhbar sangi hai

 ' tathaapi, yah dhyaan dena zaruri he ki pehle ke asweekrut siddhant, vishesh rup se samaykaal se sambandhit, asweekaar hone se shrinkhalaa main sammilit hone main badal gaye isi prakaar ho saktaa he ki anya asweekrut siddhant bhi naatak main sammilit ho jaye

 When Maharaja Shahu made his debut in Maharashtra with the aim of ascending the liberation from the detention of Aurangzeb, Balaji Vishwanath took his side and defeated his strong rival Tarabai and major enemies Chandrasen Jaghava, Udaji Chavan and Damaji Yorat, not only Shahu was enthroned
 But by strengthening its position, it saved Maharashtra from collapsing from mutual conflict
 falat: kritagya shahu ne 1713 main balaji vishwanath ko peshwa niyukt kiya
 Subsequently, the Peshwa compromised with the powerful Potnayak Kanhoji Angre and increased Shahu's dignity and statehood

 As a result of their continuous campaigns, undoubtedly, the Maratha rule had to bear a heavy burden, the Maratha empire remained unorganized due to the vast expanse, the Maratha Confederacy bore personal ambitions, and the Maratha armies proved unsatisfactory in the conquered territories; However, the iron writings of Srimanta Bajirao certainly made a proud passage of Maratha history
