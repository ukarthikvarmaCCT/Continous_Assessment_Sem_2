 To convert a normal cell into a cancer cell, genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation must be transformed
 anuvanshik parivartan kai staron par ho sakate hai, ye pur gunasutra ke laabh yaa haani ke rup main ho sakate hai, jo utparivartan kaa hi ek rup he or ek maatr DNA neucliotoide ko prabhavit karata he
 There are two broad categories of genes that are affected by these changes
 onkosin saamaanya jin ho sakate hai, jo anupyukt rup se ucch str par prakat hote hai, yaa parivartit jin jinamein noval gun hote hai
 In any case, expression of these genes promotes the malignancy pattern of cancer cells
 ganth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ve jin he jo cancer kii koshikaon ke koshika vibhaajan, astitv, yaa anya gunon ko sandamit karte hai
 Lump suppressor genes are often disabled by genetic changes that promote cancer
 aamtaur par, ek saamaanya koshika ko cancer koshika main roopantarit karne ke liye kai jeenon main parivartan hone jaruri hai
 There is a diverse classification scheme for different genomic changes, which can contribute to the production of cancer cells
 in main se adhikansh parivartan utparivartan hote hai, yaa jinomik DNA ke newcliotide anukraman main parivartan hote hai
 Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a genomic change that is not a mutation and may involve the gain or loss of one or more chromosomes by error in mitosis
 bade paimaane ke utparivartano main shaamil hai ek gunasutra ke ek bhaag kii kshati yaa vruddhi
 jinomik pravardhan tab hota he jab ek koshika ek chote gunasutri locas kii kai pratilipiyaan praapt kar leti he, saamanyatya isamen ek yaa adhik onkosin hote hai or asann anuvanshik saamagree hoti he
 Localization occurs when two different chromosomal regions, abnormally, converge at a specific location

 Small-scale mutations include point mutations, decreases or increases, which can occur in the promoter of a gene, affecting its expression
 yaa jin ke anukram koden main ho sakati he or iske protein utpaada ke sthayitv yaa kriya ko roopantarit kar sakati he
 Disruption of the sole gene can result in the integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retro virus, and this type of event can result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its progeny
 adhi-anuvaanshiki, DNA saranchana main rasinic, gaiyr utparivartaneey parivartanon ke madhyam se jin abhivyakti ke niyaman kaa adhyayan he
 The principle of over-genetics in cancer pathogenesis is that non-mutational changes in DNA cause changes in gene expression
 saamaanya rup se, onkosin shant hote hai, udhaaharan ke liye aisa DNA methilikaran ke kaaran hota he
 Damage in this methylation induces aberrant expression of oncogene, which is the cause of cancer pathogenesis
 adhi-anuvaanshik parivartan kii gyaat pranali main shaamil he diene methilikaran or gunasutra ke DNA par vishesh sthiti par jude hue histone protein kaa methilikaran yaa asitelikaran
 Classes of therapy known as HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyl transferase inhibitors may re-regulate over-genetic signaling in cancer cells
 onkosin kai prakaar se koshika vruddhi ko badhaava dete he
 Many hormones can be made, a chemical messenger between cells that induces mitotic division, the effect of which depends on signal transduction of receptor tissue or cells
 duusare shabdon main, jab ek praptakarta koshika par ek hormone grahi uttejit hota he, sanket koshika kii sataha se koshika ke kendrak ko sanvahit hota he, yah kendriya str par jin pratilekhan viniman main kuch parivartanon ko prabhavit karata he
 Some oncogenes themselves are part of the signal transit mechanism, or part of the signal receptor in cells and tissues, thus controlling the sensitivity of such hormones
 onkosin aksar samasutrajan utpann karte hai, yaa protein sanshleshan main DNA ke pratilekhan main sanlagn hote hai, jo protein or anzime banaata he, ye protein or anzime un utpaadon or jaev rasayanon ke nirmaan ke liye uttaradaayi hai, jinke saath koshikaayen antarkriya karti hai or jinka koshikaayen upyog karti hai
 Mutations in proto-oncogenes, which are generally the stable equivalents of oncogenes, can modify their expression and action, and the products increase the action or amount of the protein
 jab aisa hota he, aadya-onchogin onchogin ban jate hai or yah sankraman koshika main koshika chakra viniman ke saamaanya santulan ko bigaad detaa he, jisase aniyantrit koshika vruddhi sambhav ho jaati he
 Even if possible, the possibility of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, as they are complex for the growth, repair and establishment of the organism
 aisa keval tab hota he jab ve utparivartit ho jate hai or vruddhi ke sanket atyadhik ho jate hai
 One of the first oncogenes to be defined in cancer research is the Ras oncogene
 Mutations in the Ras family of protein-oncogenes are very common, occurring in 20% to 30% of all human lumps
 raas ko mul rup se harvey sarcoma virus jinom main pahachaanaa gaya tha or shodhakarta is baat se aashcharyachakit ho gaye ki na keval maanav jinom main yah jin upasthiti tha balki, ek utprerak niyantran tatv se judaa hua tha, jo koshika rekha sanvardhan main cancer ko prerit kar saktaa tha
 The knot suppressor gene encodes for anti-proliferation signals and proteins, which suppress mitosis and cell growth
 saamanytah, gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin pratilekhan kaarak hai jo koshikeey tanaav yaa DNA kshati ke dwaara sakriy hote hai
 Often DNA damage can result in the presence of free-radical genetic material as well as other symptoms that induce enzymes and pathways responsible for activation of knot-suppressing genes
 aise jeenon kaa kaary he DNA kii marammat ke liye koshika chakra ke aage badhane par niyantran, jo utparivartan ko putree koshika tak sthanantarit hone se roktaa he
 The p53 protein, one of the most studied knot suppressor genes, is a transcription factor that is activated by several cellular stressors, including hypoxia and ultraviolet radiation damage
 p53 roopantaran main shaamil sabhi canceron ke lagbhag aadhe ke alaava, iske gaanth ke shaman kaary ko bhalee prakaar se samajha nahin gaya he
 Apparently p53 has two functions: one a nuclear role as a transcription factor and the other a cytoplasmic role in regulating cell cycle, cell division and apoptosis
 warburg pariklpana ke anusaar cancer kii vruddhi ke liye urja hetu glycolysis kaa adhimaanya prayog hota he
 p53 regulates the transfer of the glycolytic tract from respiration
 haalanki, ek utparivartan, khud "ise band karte hue" gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ko yaa is sanket maarg ko kshati pahunchaa saktaa he, jo ise sakriy karata he, is kaa achal parinaam he ki DNA kii marammat baadhit yaa sandamit ho jaati he: marammat rahit diene kshati kaa sangrah nishchit rup cancer kaa kaaran banataa he
 Mutations of the genes that suppress the knot that occur in the germ level cells are transferred to the progeny and increase the likelihood of cancer in subsequent generations
 in pariwaron ke sadasyon ne aisi ghatnaon main vruddhi kii he or isse bahul tumor kii vilambtaa main kami ai he
 The type of knot is typical for each type of mutation that suppresses the knot, with some mutations causing specific types of cancer, while other mutations causing other types of cancer
 utparivarti tumor shaamak kii vanshagati kaa prakaar yah he ki ek prabhavi sadsy ek doshapurn pratilipi ko ek janak se or saamaanya pratilipi ko duusare janak se praapt karata he
 For example, a person who inherits a mutant p53 allele may develop melanoma and pancreatic cancer called li-fraumeni syndrome
 anya vanshaagat gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin syndrome main shaamil he retino blostoma se sambandhit Rb utparivartan or adinopoliposis badi aant ke cancer se jude APC jin utparivartan

 Finally, hereditary mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause early onset of breast cancer
 1971 main yah prastaav diya gaya ki cancer kaa vikaas kam se kam do utparivartan ghatnaon par nirbhar karata he
 According to Knudson's two-injury hypothesis, a hereditary gene level mutation in a gene that is quenching a gene will cause cancer only if another mutation occurs later in the organism's life, it is the gene that suppresses that knot
 Will inactivate other alleles
 aamtaur par, onkosin prabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan shaamil hota he, jabaki utparivartit tumor shaamak aprabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kii-haani utparivartan shaamil hota he
 Each cell has two copies of the same gene, each of which is obtained from the parent and in most cases an action-to-gain mutation in only one copy of a particular proto-oncogene, making that gene a true oncogene
 Is sufficient for duusari ore, kriya-kii-haani utparivartan kaa, gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii donon pratilipiyon main hona aavashyak he taaki jin ko puri tarah se kriyaaheen banaaya ja sake
 However, there are cases in which a mutated copy of the knot-suppressing gene neutralizes the other wild-type copy
 yah ghatana prabhavi nakaaratmak prabhaav kehalaati he or kai p53 utparivartanon main dekhi jaati he
 Knudson's two-injury model has recently been challenged by several investigators

 These initial tumor changes should be differentiated from overgrowth, which is a mutant increase in cell division due to an external stimulation, such as a hormonal imbalance or chronic irritation
 durvikasita ke sabase gambhir maamalon ko "swasthani karcarbud " kaha jaataa he
 In Latin, the word "in situ" means "in place", so the term carcinoma is in situ, the uncontrolled growth of cells that remain in their original place and have not shown any invasion of other tissues
 phir bhi, carcinoma swasthani ek aakraamak durdamata main viksit ho saktaa he or yadi sambhav ho to ise aam taur par shalya kriya ke dwaara hataa diya jaataa he
 Just as the growth occurs in animal populations, so does growth in uncontrolled populations of cells

 Similarly, pathogens such as MRSA become antibiotic-resistant and this is why crop blight and pests become resistant to pesticides
 isi vikaas ke kaaran cancer punrariti main aisi koshikaayen hoti hai jo cancer kii dawaaon ke liye pratirodh praapt kar leti hai In a 2000 article by Hannahan and Weinberg, the biological properties of the sore knot cells were summarized as follows: in bahul padon kaa puraa hona nimna ke bina ek bahut hi durlabh ghatana hogi: These biological changes are predominant in carcinoma; Other hard knots may not be all that is needed to achieve them
 udhaaharan ke liye, utak akraman or dur ke sthanon par visthaapan shwet rakt koshikaon kaa saamaanya gun he; ye pad shwetarktata ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak nahin hai
 Different positions do not necessarily represent individual mutations
 For example, inactivation of a genus will cause codons for the p53 protein, genomic instability, apoptosis, and increased angiogenesis
 cancer kii sabhi koshikaayen vibhajit nahin hoti hai
 Rather, a sub-set of cells in a knot is called the cancerous stem cells, which replicate on their own and form differentiated cells
 cancer kii rokthaam ko, cancer kii ghatnaon main kami laane ke liye sakriy upayon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 For this, avoiding cancer or altering their metabolism, adopting a lifestyle or diet that modifies cancer-causing factors and / or medical intervention may be useful

vivaad or adhik bad jaataa he jab yah spasht na ho ki screening ke laabh naidanik pareekshanon or cancer ke upachaaron ke sambhavi jokhim se adhik prabhavi hai
 For example: At the time of prostate cancer screening, the PSA test can detect small cancers that never become fatal for life, but have to begin treatment once detected
 yah sthiti ati nidaan kehalaati he, jo purush ko anaavashyak upachaar jaise shalya chikitsa or vikiran kii jatiltaaon kaa saamana karne ke liye majaboor kar detii he
 The procedures used to diagnose prostate cancer can be the cause of side effects including blood flow and infection
 prostate cancer kaa ilaaj asanyam or langik niskriyata kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Similarly, for breast cancer, it has recently been criticized that breast screening programs in some countries exacerbate rather than solve problems
 aisa isliye he ki saamaanya jansankhya main mahilaon main screening kai abhaasi dhanatmak parinaam de sakati he, jinhen agrim jaanch kii zarurat hoti he, jisaki vajah se stan cancer ke keval ek hi maamle kaa pataa lagane or uske upachaar ke liye bahut badi sankhya main mahilaon kaa upachaar kiya jaataa he
 According to a public health perspective, cervical cancer screening through pap smears is more beneficial in price than all other types of cancer, it is largely caused by a virus, there are obvious risk factors, such as cancer
 The natural way of spreading is that it usually spreads slowly over many years, so the screening program can quickly catch it
 To take more time
 iske alaava, pareekshan apane aap main sasta or bahut hi aasaan he
 For these reasons, it is important to consider the benefits and risks of the diagnostic process and treatment when considering cancer screening
 spasht lakshanon ke abhaav yukt logon main cancer ke liye medical imaging kaa upyog, samaan rup se samasya janak he
 Recently discovered incidenataloma has a high risk of screening — a benign lesion that can be considered malignant and may be potentially dangerous for it
 dhumrapaan karne waalon main fefdon ke cancer ke liye siti scan-aadhaarit screening ke haal hi main kiye gaye adhyayan ke golmol parinaam saamne aaye hai, july 2007 se vyavasthit screening kii salaah nahin di jaati he
 Epidermic clinical trials of plain-film chest X-rays that screen for lung cancer in smokers have not proved to be beneficial for this approach
 canin cancer kii jaanch ke sateek parinaam hote hai, lekin yah abhi bhi anusandhan ke praarambhik charan main he
 Most cancers are either identified early by their symptoms and signs or appear during screening
 inamen se koi bhi nishchit nidaan nahin he, jise aam taur par ek rogavigyaani kii salaah kii zarurat hoti he, yah rog vigyaani ek prakaar kaa physician hona chahie jo cancer or anya rogon ke nidaan main maahir he
 Those who are suspected of cancer are examined by medical examination
 isamen saamaanya hai rakt pareekshan, eks kiran, siti scan or antahdarshan 
 Cancer can be suspected for a number of reasons, but the definitive diagnosis of most malignancies should be ensured by a pathologist through tissue scientific testing of cancer cells
 biopsy yaa shalya chikitsa ke dwaara utak ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Many biopsies can be performed in a physician's office
 anya angon kii biopsy ek nishchetak kii upasthiti main kii jaati he, iske liye shalya chikitsa ke kaksh main shalya kriya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The tissue diagnosis given by the pathologist explains the type of cell proliferating
 saath hi gaanth kii utak vaigyanik shrenee, anuvanshik asaamanyataon or anya lakshanon ko bhi spasht karte hai
 Also, this information is useful in evaluating the patient's prior diagnosis and choosing the best treatment
 koshika anuvanshiki or pratiraksha utak rasayan vigyaan pareekshan ke anya prakaar hai jo ek rog vigyaani ek utak ke namoonay par kar saktaa he
 These tests can provide information about the molecular changes that have taken place in the cancer cell and thus indicate the future behavior and best treatment of the cancer
 cancer kaa upachaar shalya chikitsa, rasochikitsa, vikiran chikitsa, pratiraksha chikitsa, monochlonal antibody chikitsa yaa anya vidhiyon ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 The choice of therapy depends on the condition and range of the knot and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient
 Many experimental cancer treatments are also being developed
 sharir ko nuksaan pahuchaye bina cancer ko puri tarah se khatm karnaa upachaar kaa uddeshy hota he
 Sometimes this can be done surgically, but the tendency of the cancer to invade nearby tissue or spread to distant locations by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness
 chemotherapy kii prabhaavashiltaa aksar sharir main anya utakon ke vishikaran ke dwaara simit ho jaati he
 Radiation can also damage normal tissues
 kyonki "cancer" kaa sandarbh rogon ke ek varg se he, aisa sambhav nahin he ki "cancer kaa hameshaa ek maatr upachaar" hi rahegaa, phir bhi sabhi sankramak rogon ke liye ek hi upachaar hota he
 Theoretically, non-hematological cancer can be treated if it is completely removed by surgery, but this is not always possible
 jab cancer shalya chikitsa se pehle hi metastasis ke dwaara sharir ke anya angon tak pahunch jaataa he, tab puri tarah se shalya kriya dwaara ise hataa dena aam taur par asambhav hota he
 In the halted sample of cancer progression, the knot grows spatially, then spreads to the lymph nodes, and then to all other parts of the body
 For this reason, the popularity of endemic treatments such as surgery for small cancers has increased
 yahan tak ki chote sthaniyakrut tumor main bhi metastasis kii bahut adhik kshamta hoti he
 Examples of surgical procedures for cancer include - breast amputation for breast cancer and prostate-piercing for prostate cancer
 The goal of surgery is to either remove the knot or remove the entire organ
 a cancer cell is invisible to the naked eye, but can then grow into a new knot, a process known as recurrence
 is kaaran ke liye, rogavigyaani shalya kriya se nikaale gaye namoonay kii jaanch karte hai, yadi swasth utak kii seemaa upasthit he, to is baat kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he ki sookshm cancer kii koshikayen rogi ke sharir main rah gai hai
 In addition to the removal of the primary knot, surgery is often required for stage determination eg determining the extent of the disease and determining whether it has reached the regional lymph nodes via metastasis
 avasthaa nirdhaaran purv nidaan kaa mukhya nirdharak he or sahyogi chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa bhi he
 Often, surgery is necessary to control symptoms such as spinal cord compression or bowel obstruction
 ise shaman upachaar ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation to destroy cancer cells and compressed lumps
 vikiran chikitsa ko bahya kiran radiotherapy ke dwaara baahar se hi niyantrit kiya jaataa he yaa brekitherapy ke dwaara andar se niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 The effect of radiation therapy is localized and limited to the area to be treated
 vikiran chikitsa, ilaaj kiye jane vaale kshetra kii koshikaon ko kshatigrast karti he yaa nasht kar detii he, is kriya main in koshikaon ke anuvanshik padaarth ko nasht kar diya jaataa he taaki koshikaon main aage vibhaajan or vruddhi na ho paae
yadhyapi vikiran cancer kii koshikaon or saamaanya koshikaon donon ko nasht kar dete hai, adhikansh saamaanya koshikaayen vikiran ke prabhaav se ubar aati hai or thik prakaar se kaary karne lagati hai
 The goal of radiation therapy is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting damage to nearby healthy tissue
 isliye, yah kai bhaagon main di jaati he jisase bich kii avadhi main swasth utakon ko thik hone kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Radiation therapy can be used to treat almost every type of solid lump, including cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, abdomen, uterus, or soft tissue sarcoma
 
 leukemia or limphoma ke upachaar main bhi vikiran chikitsa kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The radiation dose for each site depends on many factors, these factors are, the radio sensitivity of each type of cancer and whether the surrounding tissue or organs can be destroyed by radiation
 is prakaar, har prakaar ke upachaar main, vikiran chikitsa iske parshv dushprabhavon ke bina nahin he
 Cancer treatment of cancer is done in medicines which can destroy cancer cells
 vartmaan upyog main, shabd "rasochikitsa" kaa upyog un cytotoxic yaa koshikavishi dawaaon ke liye kiya jaataa he jo lakshith chikitsa ke vipareet, saamaanya rup main tezi se vibhajit hoti hui koshikaon ko prabhavit karti hai
 
 Rheumatic drugs inhibit cell division in various possible ways, for example by replication of DNA or segregation of newly formed chromosomes
 Most forms of chemotherapy target all cells that rapidly divide, specific only to cancer cells
 Are not, although some specificity is due to the fact that most cancer cells are not capable of repairing DNA damage
 Whereas normal cells typically have these abilities
 atah, rasochikitsa main swasth utakon ko nuksaan pahunchane kii kshamta hoti he, vishesh rup se ve utak jinamein ucch pratisthaapan dar hoti he 
ye koshikaayen aamtaur par rasochikitsa ke baad apni marammat kar leti hai
 Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are given at the same time
 ise "sangyojan rasochikitsa" kaha jaataa he; adhikansh rasochikitsa regimen ek sangyojan main hi die jate hai
 Treatment of some types of leukemia and lymphoma requires high doses of chemotherapy or whole body decompression
 yah upachaar asthi majja ko alag kar detaa he or isliye sharir kii thik hone or rakt ke punarniman kii kshamta pruthakkrut ho jaati he
 For this reason, bone marrow, or peripheral blood column cell harvesting is performed before the ablation effect of therapy so that "rescue" is possible after treatment
 ise autologus stem koshika pratyaropan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Alternatively, hematopoietic stem cells taken from a matched unrelated donor can be transplanted
 lakshith therapy jo 1990 ke dashak ke ant main sabase pehle uplabdh hui, kaa kai prakaar ke cancer ke upachaar main mukhya prabhaav tha or vartmaan main yah ek bahut hi adhik sakriy anusandhan kshetra he
 This includes the use of factors that are specialized to unregulate the proteins of cancer cells
 chote anu lakshith upachaar dawaayein aamtaur par cancer koshikaon ke bheetar utparivartit, ati abhivyakt, yaa anya jatil proteinon par anzymetic domen kii sandamak hoti hai
 Major examples are the thyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib and zefitinib
 monochlonal pratirakshi chikitsa ek anya ranneeti he jisamen upachaar kaa kaarak ek pratirakshi hota he jo cancer koshikaon kii sataha par ek protein ke saath vishesh rup se bandha bana letaa he
 Examples include anti-her2 / neu antibody trastuzumeb used in breast cancer and anti-cd-20 antibody rituximeb used in many types of B-cell malignancies
 lakshith therapy main "homing yukti" ke rup main chote peptid bhi shaamil ho sakate hai, jo gaanth ke chaaron ore prabhavit bahya koshiki matrix ke saath yaa koshika kii sataha par grahi ke saath baandh bana sakate hai
 Radio nuclides that are attached to these peptides eventually kill the cancer cell if the nucleus is decomposing around the cell
 vishesh rup se in bandhit padaarthon ke oligo- yaa multimers bahut mahatvapurn hote hai, chunki ve gaanth kii vishistataa or uthkanthaa ko badhaate hai
 Photodynamic therapy is a triple treatment for cancer that includes photosensitizers, tissue oxygen, and light
 PDT kaa upyog aadhari koshika carcinoma yaa fefdon ke cancer ke upachaar ke liye kiya jaataa he; PDT bade tumor ko shalya chikitsa ke dwaara hataa die jane ke baad durdam utak ke bache hue avasheshon ko hataane main bhi upyogi ho saktaa he
 Cancer immune therapy is a group of different medical strategies designed to induce a patient's own immune system to fight the knot
 gaanth ke khilaaf pratirakshi pratikriya utpann karne ke liye kai vidhiyaan hai, ye hai, satahi mutrashi cancer ke liye antar dhaneey BCG pratiraksha chikitsa, tathaa vrikk koshika carcinoma or melanoma ke rogiyon main pratirakshi pratikriya prerit karne ke liye interferon or anya cytokine kaa upyog
 kai prakaar kii ganthon, khaas taur par durdam melanoma or vrikk koshika carcinoma, ke liye vishisht pratiraksha pratikriya utpann karne ke liye vexinon par gahan anusandhan kiya ja rahaa he
 cephalucal-t is a vaccine-like strategy used in modern clinical trials for prostate cancer, in which thrushmash cells taken from the patient are loaded with prostatic acid phosphatase peptides to induce a specific immune response against prostate-derived cells
 To be
 elloginenic hemetopoctic stem koshika pratyaropan ko pratiraksha therapy kaa ek rup mana ja saktaa he, kyonki daata kii pratiraksha koshikaayen grapht-banaam-gaanth prabhaav ke tahat gaanth par aksar akraman karti hai
 Therefore, allogeneic HSCT causes higher rates of treatment than autologous transplants for many types of cancer, although side effects are also more severe
 kuch cancer kii vruddhi ko vishesh hormonon ko uplabdh kara kar yaa avaruddh karke sandamit kiya ja saktaa he
 Some common examples of hormone sensory lumps are - specific types of breast and prostate cancer
 Removing or blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional treatment
 vishesh prakaar ke canceron main, hormone kaa prashasan shithil ho jaataa he, jaise projestogen chikitsa kii drushti se laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 Angiogenesis that is required for the tumor to survive
 kuch, jaise bevasizumeb, ko manyata de di gayi he or chikitsakeey upyog main inkaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 a main problem with anti-angiogenesis drugs is that many factors stimulate the growth of blood vessels in normal and cancerous cells
 angiogenesis virdohi dawaaye keval ek hi kaarak ko lakshya banaati hai, isliye anya kaarak rakt vahini kii vruddhi ko uttejit karnaa jari rakhte hai
 Other problems include route of administration, maintenance of stability and action and targeting on tumor vasculature
 yadhyapi cancer ke lakshanon par niyantran ko cancer kaa upachaar nahin mana ja saktaa he, yah cancer rogiyon kii jivan kii gunvattta kaa ek mahatvapurn nirdharak he or is faisle main mukhya bhoomika nibhaataa he ki rogi anya upachaar ke liye sakasham he yaa nahin
 Although doctors have the therapeutic skills to reduce pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, and other common problems in cancer patients, this group of patients responds to the needs of symptom control in a multi-disciplinary manner of palliative care
 Specialty has evolved
 dard kii dawaaye, jaise ki morphine or oxicodon or michali or ulti ko rokane ke liye antiemetics dawaaen, cancer se sambandhit lakshanon se yukt rogiyon main aam taur par kaam main lee jaati hai
 Sophisticated antiemetics such as ondansetron and analogues, as well as aprapitant, have made radical treatment more likely in cancer patients
 cancer ke kaaran purana dard hameshaa satat utak kshati ke kaaran hota he jo rog yaa upachaar prakriya se sambandhit he yadhyapi paryaavarniya karkon or dard ke vyavhaar ke utpaadan main prabhavi gadbadi kii bhi bhoomika hoti he, cancer ke dard se yukt rogiyon main aam taur par pramukh ityologic kaaran nahin hote hai
 Furthermore, most patients with severe cancer-related pain are in the late stages of their lives and need palliative therapy
 mudde jaise nashile padaarthon ke upyog kaa saamaajik kalank, kaam or kaaryaatmak sthiti or swasthya dekhbhaal, samgr maamle ke prabandhan main adhik mahatvapurn nahin hai
 Therefore, the specific strategy for cancer pain management is to try to get maximum comfort to the patient by the use of narcotics and other drugs, surgical and physical methods
 doctor cancer ke antim sthiti ke rogiyon main dard ke liye maadak padaarthon kaa upyog nahin karnaa chaahate hai kyon ki isse unhen isaki lat ho sakati he yaa unki shwaas kriya main baadha aa sakati he
 Palliative care is a new branch of the care movement that provides more comprehensive support in the treatment of pain in cancer patients
 thakaan cancer rogiyon ke liye ek bahut hi aam samasya he or haal hi main cancer chikitsa vigyaniyon ke liye iskaa upachaar bahut mahatvapurn ban gaya he, yadhyapi yah kai rogiyon main jivan kii gunvattta ko lekar mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Clinical trials, also called research studies, also test new treatments in cancer patients
 is shodh kaa lakshya he cancer ke ilaaj ke liye behatar tareeke khojna or cancer rogiyon kii madad karnaa
 Clinical trials test a range of therapies such as new drugs, new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy, new combinations of treatments, or new methods such as gene therapy
 ek naidanik pareekshan, ek lambi or satark cancer anusandhan kii prakriya ke antim charnon main se ek he
 The search for new treatments begins in the laboratory, where scientists first test and develop new ideas
 agar ek drushtikon upyogi prathit hota he to aglaa kadam hota he iskaa jaanavar par pareekshan, jo yah bataata he ki cancer rogi par iskaa kya prabhaav hoga or iske koi hanikaarak prabhaav hai yaa nahin
 Of course, many treatments that work well in the laboratory or in animals do not always prove effective in humans
 upyogi maane jane vaale upachaar surakshit or prabhavi hai yaa nahin, iskaa pataa lagane ke liye cancer ke rogiyon main adhyayan kiye jate hai
 It may be that the patient participating in this treatment will personally get help from this treatment
 ve cancer visheshgyon se aadhuniktam suraksha praapt karte hai or ve yaa to jaanch kiya ja rahaa nayaa ilaaj praapt karte hai yaa cancer ke liye sarvottam uplabdh maanak upachaar praapt karte hai
 Also, new treatments may carry unknown risks, but if new treatments prove effective or more effective than standard treatments, the patient studied becomes the first person to receive its benefit
 is baat kii koi guarantee nahin he ki pareekshan kiya jane vaala nayaa upachaar yaa ek maanak upachaar achche parinaam degaa
 In children with cancer, a survey showed that children who underwent such testing did not, on average, see better or worse outcomes than standard treatments; This ensures that the success or failure of any experimental treatment cannot be predicted
 poorak or vaikalpik chikitsa upachaar, chikitsa, swasthya raksha pranaaliyon, prathaon or utpaadon ke vividh samooh hai, jo parmparik chikitsa ke bhaag nahin hai

 It was due to Pandit Nehru's efforts that Mountbatten was made the first Governor General of independent India, while Jinnah refused to accept Mountbatten as the first Governor General of Pakistan, which Mountbatten had regretted all his life
 mountabeton 24 march 1947 se 30 june 1948 tak bharat main rahe
 In these fifteen months he was not only the constitutional head but also decisive of India's important policies

 Sometimes the surface of the wall itself is unable to pick up a uniform color from the distemper, either due to spots, or due to a variety of plasters
 aisi dasha main dystemper karne se pehle astr lagaana padataa he
 Distemper making companies also make suitable lining

48 Farreh Chautham is a village in Khagaria, Bihar
 bhukh us samay anubhav hoti he, jab khaanaa khaane kii ichha hoti he
 Frugality is the lack of appetite
 bhukh kii anubhuti hypothelmas se shuru hoti he jab yah hormone chodta he
 This hormone reacts to the receptor of the liver
 haalanki ek saamaanya vayakti bina bhojan ke kai saptahon tak jinda rah saktaa he
 The hunger sensation starts a few hours after the meal and the person starts feeling uncomfortable
 bhukh shabd kaa istemaal vyakti ke saamaajik str ko bataane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 When the stomach starts twitching
 bhukh kaa marod aksar bhojan ke baarah se choubees ghante ke pehle shuru nahin hota he
 One mode of hunger lasts for about 30 seconds
 or yah lagaataa 30–45 minuton tak hota rahaa he
 After that, the appetite reduces to 30-150 minutes The fluctuation of leptin and ghrelin hormone levels results in the motivation of an organism to consume food
 When an organism eats, adipocytes trigger the release of leptin into the body
 Increasing levels of leptin results in a reduction of one's motivation to eat
 After hours of non-consumption, leptin levels drop significantly
 These low levels of leptin cause the release of secondary hormone, ghrelin, which in turn reinitiates the feeling of hunger
 Some studies have suggested that an increased production of ghrelin may increase appetite evoked by the sight of food, while an increase in stress may also influence the hormone's production
 These findings may help to explain why hunger can prevail even in stressful situations
 Hunger appears to increase activity and movement in many animals - for example, an experiment on spiders showed increased activity and predation in starved spiders, resulting in larger weight gain
 This pattern is seen in many animals, including humans while sleeping
 It even occurs in rats with their cerebral cortex or stomachs completely removed
 Increased activity on hamster wheels occurred when rats were deprived not only of food, but also water or b vitamins such as thiamine
 This response may increase the animal's chance of finding food, though it has also been speculated the reaction relieves pressure on the home population
 On June 19, 2009, it was reported that the world hunger hit one billion people, about a sixth of the world's total population
 There were 923 million hungry people in the world in 2007, an increase of 80 million since 1990
 The world already produces enough food to feed everyone - 6 billion people - and could feed the double - 12 billion people
 The Meals on Wheels Association of America Foundation has found that hunger is a serious threat facing millions of seniors in the United States, and that understanding the problem is a critical first step to developing remedies
 In 2007, MOWAAF, underwritten by the Harrah's Foundation, commissioned a research study entitled The Causes, Consequences and Future of Senior Hunger in America
 The report was released at a hearing of the US Senate Special Committee on Aging in March 2008 in Washington, DC The study found that in the United States, over 5 million seniors,, experience some form of food insecurity 
 Of these, about 2
5 million are at-risk of hunger, and about 750,000 suffer from hunger due to financial constraints
 Some groups of seniors are more likely to be at-risk of hunger
 Relative to their representation in the overall senior population, those with limited incomes, under age 70, African American, Hispanic, never-married, renters, and seniors living in the Southern United States are all more likely to be at-risk of hunger
 While certain groups of seniors are at greater-risk of hunger, hunger cuts across the income spectrum
 For example, over 50% of all seniors who are at-risk of hunger have incomes above the poverty threshold
 Likewise, it is present in all demographic groups
 For example, over two-thirds of seniors at-risk of hunger are Caucasian
 There are marked differences in the risk of hunger across family structure, especially for those seniors living alone, or those living with a grandchild
 Those living alone are twice as likely to experience hunger compared to married seniors
 One in five senior households with a grandchild present is at-risk of hunger, compared to about one in twenty households without a grandchild present
 Seniors living in non-metropolitan areas are as likely to experience food insecurity as those living in metropolitan areas, suggesting that food insecurity cuts across the urban-rural continuum
 a food craving is an intense desire to consume a specific food, as opposed to general hunger
 Like, thirst is the craving for fluids
 Withdrawal craving is a "hunger" for administering addictive drugs
 saanchaa chakra mila: saanchaa:world cinemaworld cinema is a term used primarily in English language speaking countries to refer to the films and film industries of non-english speaking countries 
 It is therefore often used interchangeably with the term Foreign film
 However, both World cinema and Foreign film could be taken to refer to the films of all countries other than one's own, regardless of native language
 Technically, foreign film does not mean the same as foreign language film, but the inference, particularly in the US, is that a foreign film is not only foreign in terms of the country of production, but also in terms of the language used
 As such, the use of the term foreign film for films produced in the UK, Australia, Canada or other English speaking countries would be uncommon
 In other English speaking countries, it would be extremely unlikely to class films made in the U
S
 as foreign films, or belonging to World cinema, as American films are reasonably dominant in all English-language markets
 World cinema has an un-official implication of films with "artistic value" as opposed to "hollywood commercialism
" Foreign language films are often grouped with "art House films" and other independent films in DVD stores, cinema listings etc
unless dubbed into one's native language, foreign language films played in English speaking regions usually have English subtitles
 Few films of this kind receive more than a limited release and many are never played in major cinemas
 As such the marketing, popularity and gross takings for these films are usually markedly less than for typical Hollywood blockbusters
 The combination of subtitles and minimal exposure adds to the notion that "world Cinema" has an inferred artistic prestige or intelligence, which may discourage less sophisticated viewers
 Additionally, Foreign language films can be commercial, low brow or B-movies, so to automatically assume that World cinema is "arty" or intellectual is erroneous
 Furthermore, foreign language films can cross cultural boundaries, particularly when the visual spectacle and style is sufficient to overcome people's misgivings
 Films of this ilk are becoming more common, and recent examples such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Amélie and Brotherhood of the Wolf enjoyed great success in Western cinemas and DVD sales
 The first foreign and foreign language film to top the North American box office was Hero in the fall of 2004
 This is a list of recent successful world cinema films in United States cinemas
 Foreign language films that are particularly successful in international markets may be taken on by the large film distribution companies for DVD releases
 At the other end of the scale, many foreign language films are never given a DVD release outside of their home markets

 It was established in 1791
 is mahavidhyalay se anekon khyathlabdh adhyaaapak nikle
 In 1958, it was merged with Sampurnanand Sanskrit University
 To establish their rule in India, the officers of the East India Company thought in necessary to preserve the knowledge of Hindus and Muslims
 In the year 1750 they passed a resolution for that purpose
 To preserve Urdu, they established a Madarsa at Calcutta, whereas for protection and development of Sanskrit, they chose Benares
 In 1791, during the period of British rule in India, Jonathan Duncan, the representative of the Honourable East India Company proposed the establishment of a Sanskrit college for development and preservation of the Sanskrit Vangmaya and to show that the English people were in favour of the development of the Indian culture
 This was sanctioned by Governor General Lord Cornwallis
 Kashi Naresh Mahip Narayan Singh donated a huge tract of land in the southern part of Benares for construction of the college
 The first teacher of this Institution was Pandit Kashinath
 The Governor General initially sanctioned a budget of Rs
 20,000 per annum
 Initially the college offered courses up to graduation

 Initially, his father taught mathematics and science

 sudhaarwad vyaavhaaravaadi sudhaaron se alag hai : sudhaarwad yah dharna hai ki sudhaaron ke sanchay se ek aise saamaajik-aarthik pranali kaa udbhav ho saktaa hai, jo poonjeevaad or loktantr ke vartmaan roopon se puri tarah alag ho; jabaki, vyavahaaravaadi sudhaar un prayaason kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, jo moulik or sanrachanaatmak badlaavon ke kilaaf yathasthiti kii raksha karte hai

 ankampet main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke anantpur jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The story told by the third effigy Chandrakala is as follows- Once, in effort and luck, who is big
 purusharth kahata ki bagaiyr mehnat ke kuch bhi sambhav nahin he jabaki bhagya kaa maananaa tha ki jisko jo bhi miltaa he bhagya se miltaa he parishram kii koi bhoomika nahin hoti he
 Their dispute took such a fierce form that both had to go to Devraj Indra
 jhagada bahut hi pechida tha isliye indra bhi chakra gaye
 Purusharth is not considered by those who had received everything by luck
 duusari taraf agar bhagya ko bada bataate to purusharth unka udhaaharan prastut karata jinhone mehnat se sab kuch arjeet kiya tha
 Confused and did not come to any conclusion
 kaaphi sochane ke baad unhen vikramaditya kii yaad ai
 He felt that only he can solve this quarrel in the whole world
 unhone purusharth or bhagya ko vikramaditya ke paas jane ke liye kaha
 Purusharth and fate went to Vikram in human disguise
 vikram ke paas aakar unhone apane jhagade kii baat rakhi
 Even Vikramaditya could not think of a solution immediately
 unhone donon se chha: maheene kii mohalat maangi or unase chha: maheene ke baad aane ko kaha
 Vikramaditya thought a lot when they went away
 kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch sake to unhone saamaanya janata ke bich bhesh badalakar ghoomana shuru kiya
 After a lot of wandering, when he could not find any satisfactory solution, he decided to roam in other states as well
 kaaphi bhatakane ke baad bhi jab koi samaadhaan nahin niklaa to unhone ek vyapaaree ke yahan naukari kar lee
 The businessman gave him the job after he said that he would do the work that others could not do
 kuch dinon baad vah vyapaaree jahaaj par apana maal ladakar duusare deshon main vyapaar karne ke liye samudri raste se chal padaa
 Among other servants Vikramaditya was also with him
 jahaaj kuch hi dur gaya hoga ki bhayanak tufaan aa gaya
 a wave of fear and frustration raged among the people aboard the ship
 kisi tarah jahaaj ek tapu ke paas aayaa or vahaan lungar daal diya gaya
 After the storm calmed down, they started removing the free food
 magar lungar kisi ke uthaae na uthaa
 Now the businessman remembered that Vikramaditya had taken the job, saying that no one could do it
 usne vikram se lungar uthaane ko kaha
 The anchor was easily lifted by them
 lungar uthte hi jahaaj aisi gati se bad gaya ki tapu par vikram chhot gaye
 He did not understand what to do
 dweep par ghoomane-phirane chal pade
