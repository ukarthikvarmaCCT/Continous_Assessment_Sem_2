 The report of Yusuf Khan's resounding victory has now filled Arcot Nawab with envy and alarm that he might leave him
 yusuf khan ne ab sabhi vyapaariyon ko sidhe yusuf khan ko kar prastut karne kaa nirdesh diya tha, jabaki arkot nawab unke madhyam se karon ko paar karnaa chaahate the
 "lord Pigot", the British governor, diplomatically advised Yusuf Khan to do as ordered by the Arcot Nawab, with some British merchants supporting the citation of Yusuf Khan as Nawab's employee

 One morning, while Yusuf Khan was offering his prayers inside the fort, Marchand, Srinivasa Rao and Baba Sahib went quietly and pinned Yusuf Khan to the ground and tied him using his turban
 is uttejnaa ko sunakar, yusuf khan ke najadik mudaali naamak ek yuvati ne alarm uthaaya
 He was quickly caught and cut

 Unfortunately, the major part of Yusuf Khan's original forces remained unaware of the fateful drama that had been set up inside his house that morning
 agle din, 15 oktober 1764 kii shaam ko, samamutipuram main sena shivi ke paas madurai-dindigul road par, yusuf khan ko argot ke nawab mohammad ali khan waljah dwaara vidrohi ke rup main lataka diya gaya tha

 It is also possible that the extreme grief of the people and soldiers inside the fort may have forced Yusuf Khan's physician Diwan Srinivasa Rao and Baba Sahib to hand over Yusuf Khan to the English, lift him up a siege and give the people their intense suffering and Relieve pain unhone kalpana kii hogi ki yusuf khan ko karawas ke rup main sankshipt karawas or / yaa jurmaana lagaaya jayega or baad main chhod diya jayega

 At the time of his death, Yusuf Khan had a son, who must have been 2 or 3 years old

 Many times only surface hardening is done; Like wood or natural stones
 bahut se vidyut yaa electronic ghatakon yaa avyavon ko jodakar vidyut paripath banate hai
 There are two types of components that can be added to a circuit: hierarchy and parallelogram
 jis paripath main sabhi ghatak shreneekram main jude hon, use shrenee paripath or jis paripath main sabhi ghatak samanaantar kram main jude hon use samanaantar paripath kaha ja saktaa he
 In the series circuit, the same current flows through each component, while in the parallel circuit, the same voltage is available on each component
 shrenee paripathon main prayek ghatak kaa karyrat rahanaa aavashyak he, anyathaa paripath tut jaayegaa
 The remaining components will continue to function even if any component in the sequence circuits is defective, but the entire circuit may be short-circuited if any component is short-circuited
 yadi kisi paripath main kisi sthaan par 10 om ke pratirodh kii aavashyaktaa he kintu vah uplabdh nahin he kintu 5-5 om ke do pratirodh sulabh hai to inako shreneekram main jodakar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if two resistors of 20–20 ohm are available, adding them in parallel, the equivalent resistance of 10 ohm is obtained
 dedh-do volt sahan kar sakane vaale saikadon balbon ko shreneekram main jodakar 230 volt se gharelu bijli se unako jagamagaaya jaataa he
 If 24 volts are needed somewhere, 24 volts can be obtained by connecting two 12 volt batteries in series
 paripathon main bhinn prakaar ke avyav bhi shreneekram yaa samaantarkram main jude ho sakate hai udhaaharan ke liye diod kii raksha ke liye uske shreneekram main upyukt maan kaa fus laga diya jaataa he; yaa pankhe ko chaalu / band karne ke liye uske shreneekram main ek switch daalaa jaataa he
 In the same way, a diode is inserted in its parallel in order to avoid voltage in the reverse direction in an electrolytic capacitor
 kisi sthaan par 2 ampir dhara vahan kar sakane vaala diod lagaana ho to 1 ampear dhara vahan kar sakane vaale do diod samaantarkram main laga dene se bhi kaam chal saktaa he
 When two or more components of electricity are connected in such a way that the same current flows in them, it is called hierarchy
 arthath, shreneekram main jude sabhi avyavon main prayek kshan ek samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he
 However, the potential difference between the ends of those individual components depends on the electrical properties of those components
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi 10 om, 20 om or 50 om ke teen pratirodhon ko shreneekram main joda gaya ho or 10 om vaale pratirodh main 2 ampiore dhara bah rahi ho to 20 om evam 50 om vaale pratirodhon main bhi 2 ampear dhara pravaahit ho rahi hogi
 But the potential of these three resistors will vary

 The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei of different origin located in the brain of spinal organisms that function as a combined functional unit
 ve mastishk ke agr bhaag ke aadhaar kshetra main sthit hote hai or cerebral cortex, thilemus tathaa mastishk ke anya kshetron se majbootee se jude hote hai
 The basal ganglia are associated with a variety of tasks, including voluntary mobility control, procedural learning related to daily behavior or "habits", eye movements, cognitive and emotional functions
 vartmaan main lokapriy siddhant basal gangliya ko mukhyatah kriya chayan ke liye jimmedaar maanate hai, arthath is baat kaa nirnay karnaa ki ek samay par vibhinn sambhav vyavhaaron main se kise karnaa he
 Experimental studies show that the basal ganglia exert inhibitory effects on several motile mechanisms, and the motile mechanism is activated as soon as this inhibitory effect is removed
 basal gangliya main "vyavhaar kaa badalanaa" mastisk ke kai hisson se prasaarit hone vaale sanketon se prabhavit hota he, jisamen sammilit he prifrantal cortex jo ki kaaryakari kaamon main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The main components of the basal ganglia are the striatum, also called neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate and putamen, the globus pallidus or pallidum which is composed of the globus pallidus externa or the globus pallidus interna, the substra nigra which is the substra nigra pars compacta and the substra
 The pars consists of the reticulata and the subthalamic nucleus
 The striatum, which is the largest component, receives input from several brain regions but only sends output to other components of the basal ganglia
 palidam sabase mahatvapurn input striatum se praapt karata he or nirodhatmak output gatishiltaa se sambandhit kai kshetron ko bhejtaa he, jisamen sammilit he thilemus kaa hissaa jo cortex ke gatishiltaa se sambandhit kshetron ko ubharta he
 The reticulata, which is a part of the Substenia nigra, acts like the pallidum, and another part called the compacta provides the input of the neuro-transmitter dopamine source to the striatum
 sabathalemic nabhik mukhya rup se striatum tathaa cortex se input praapt karata he or palidam ke hisse ko bhej detaa he
 Each of these regions has an intrinsic structural and neuro-chemical organization
 vibhinn tantrika avasthaaon, jiname kai gatishiltaa se jude vikaar hai, main basal gangliya kendriya bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Most notable are Parkinson's disease, in which melanin pigmented dopamine-producing cells collapse in the compacta on the substrainsia nigra and Huntington's disorder in which the striatum is originally damaged
 kuch vyavhar niyantran se jude vikaron main basal gangliya kii akaryakshmata avasthaa bhi pai jaati he, jaise ki, torates syndrome main, belismus, jununee badhyakaari vikaar, evam wilson rog 
 wilson rog or hemi belismus vikaar ke alawa parkinsans vikaar evam hantingtons vikaar se sambandhit neuro pathology tantron ko thik prakaar se samajha nahin ja sakaa he athwa ve ab bhi vikasshil saidhantik avasthaa main hi hai
 The basal ganglia have an extremity-like area with components distinctly named - nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental region
 Efferents provide dopamine to the nucleus accumbens in the same way that the substrains provide dopamine to the nigra dorsal striatum
 chunki aise bahut saare sakshya hai jo darshaate hai ki durlabh adhyayan main isaki kendriya bhoomika hoti he, atah vitie → ene ke dopaminergic prakshepan ne badi sankhya main is ore dhyaan aakarshith kiya he
 For example, many highly addictive drugs, including cocaine, amphetamines, and nicotine, are thought to act by enhancing the efficacy of the VTA → NA dopamine signal
 is baat ke bhi saboot hai ki paagalpan main vitie → ene dopaminergic prakshepan ati uttejnaa par prabhavi he
 The classification of the human nervous system from the point of view of development is often based on 3 basic primitive cavities
 ukt praathmik guhaayen maanav bhrun main neural nalika ke saamaanya vikaas ke samay banati hai or prarambh main isamen rostral se kodal abhivinyas main sammilit rahati hai- procenciphelon, messencephelon, evam robenciphelon guhaayen
 baad main, tantrika tantra ke vikaas ke dauraan, prayek anubhag chote-chote avyavon main parivartit ho jate hai
 The following table shows this developmental classification and follows the body structure found in the basal ganglia
 : The basal ganglia are a basic component of telencyphelone
 iske vipareet, cortics kii parat agramastishk kii sataha ko astr karti hai, jab ki basal gangliya jo ki grey padaarth kaa alag hi dikhaai dene vaala samooh he vah mastishk kii gaharaai main thilemus ke sangam ke sameep hi sthit hota he
 Like most parts of the brain, the basal ganglia also have left and right sides in the form of virtual images of each other
 shaareerik sanrachanaatmak drushti se sharir sanrachana shastriyon ne basal gangliya ko chaar alag-alag sanrachanaon main vibhajit kiya he or yah vibhaajan is par nirbhar karata he ki ukt sanrachana kitni behatar tareeke se rostral hai : inamen se do arthath striatum evam palidam apekshaakrit badi hai, anya do, arthath sabstantia nigra evam sabthelmic nabhik aakaar main choti sanrachana hai
 In the example on the right, the position of the components of the basal ganglia is shown in the two cranial section maps of the human brain
 tipanni ke swarup spasht kiya jaataa he ki, ukt maanchitr main dikhaai na dene vaale, sabthelmic nabhik or sabstantia nigra mastisk main bahut peeche sthit hai
 The striatum is the largest component of the basal ganglia
 striatum kii sanrachana ko kuch vishisht dishaao main kaate jane par dhaariyaan dikhaai detii hai jiname se kai chote-bade tantrika tantuon kaa ugam dikhaai detaa he, isliye iske liye shabd "striatum" prayukt kiya jaataa he
 Earlier anatomy scientists had tested the human brain and understood that the striatum is made up of two different substances separated by an expansion of a white substance called the internal capsule
 unhone in do padaarthon ko codet or putamin kaa naam diya
 aadhunik sharir sanrachana vaigyanikon ne sookshmdarshi or neuro rasinic adhyayanon dwaara nishkarsh nikaala ki in padaarthon ko ek hi rachana arthath striatum ke do alag hisson ke rup main maananaa uchit he, thik usee tarah, jis tarah kisi nagar ko koi nadi do hisson main pruthak karti he
 Several functional differences between the caudate and putamen have been identified, but are thought to be the result of facts under which each region of the striatum has been found to be essentially connected to specific parts of the cerebral cortex
 striatum kaa aantarik sanghathan asaadhaaran rup se jatil he
 Most of the neurons in it are of the "medium spiny neurons" type
 ve jiabiergik koshikaayen hai jinaki koshika nikaay chote hai or dendrit ghaney dendrytic kaanton se aachhadit hai jinhen syneptic input multah cortex evam thilemus se praapt hote hai
 Medium thorny neurons can be divided into subtypes in several ways, depending on neurochemical and method of attachment
 aglaa sabase adhik bahu-sankhya kaa prakaar, bade, chikani dendrit yukt, colinergik antarneurons hai
 There are many other types of intrinsic neurons, which are small segments of the neural population
 kai adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki cortex or striatum ke bich aamtaur par sthalakritik sambandh rahe hai, arthath, cortex kaa prayek hissaa striatum ke kuch bhaag ko, uske baad anya ko, majboot input bhejtaa he
 The nature of the topography is difficult to understand, but, perhaps in part because the organization of the striatum is organized in three dimensions while the cortex, as a layered structure, is held in two
 is aiami visangati ke chalate ek sanrachana kaa duusari par maanchitran karne main badi maatra main virupan or algaav dikhaai padataa he
 Interestingly, the same topographic relationships apply to the thalamus striatal
 palidam globas palids naamak ek badi sanrachana hoti he joki ek chote udar taleey vistaar ke saath sthit hoti he, jise ventral palidam kaha jaataa he
 Globus pallidus appears as a single nerve substance, but due to functional differences can be divided into two parts, those parts are called internal extracellular segments, and also abbreviated as GPI and GPE
 donon khandon main multah jiabergik neurons hote hai, jo unke lakshya par nirodhatmak prabhaav dikhaate hai
 The above two segments participate in different neural circuits
 bahari khand athwa jipii ko pramukh rup se input prapti striatum se hoti he or vah sabathalemus nabhik par prakshepit hota he
 The inner segment, or GPI, receives signals by the striatum through two paths, called "direct" and "indirect" paths
 palidle neurons ek "gaiyr nirodhatmak" siddhant kaa upyog kar kaary karte hai
 The said neurons project at a steady high rate in the absence of input and they are in a state of "stagnation" as indicated by the striatum
 chunki swayan palidle neurons kaa unke lakshyon par nirodhatmak prabhaav he, palidam ko praapt input kaa kul prabhaav palidle koshika dwaara lakshyon par pradarshit niyantrit nirodh ke rup main dikhaai detaa hai
 Substencia nigra is a miscephalic gray matter portion of the basal ganglia that is divided into SNR and SNC
 aksar esaenar jipiai ke saath saamanjasy main kaam karata he evam esaenar - jipiai complex, thilemus kaa nirodhi kaary karata he
 Substantia nigra pars compacta forms the neuro transmitter dopamine, which is very important in balancing the striatal tract
 neeche diya gaya paripath basal gangliya ke avyavon kii bhoomika evam paripath ko samajhaata he
 The subthalamic nucleus is a diencephalic gray matter of the basal ganglia, and is the only part of the ganglia that actually forms the "excitatory" glutamic acid transmitter
 sabathalemic nabhik kii bhoomika esaenar-jipiai complex ko uttejit karnaa he or saath hi vah "apratyaksh maarg" kaa ek hissaa bhi hota he
 To understand the complex circuit of the basal ganglia, we first need to know the important partners of the circuit
 basal gangliya thilemus or cortex ke saath sidhe sampark main hota he
 Therefore, the circuit produced by the basal ganglia consists of the three main partners of the cortex, the thalamus, and the basal ganglia, the basal ganglia
 maanav mastishk cortex, satta kii ucchtam sthiti, evam jagat ke prati jaagruk dharna ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 All functions performed directly or indirectly by the nervous system are related to the cortex
 cortex ke kai alag-alag kshetra bhinn-bhinn kaamon ko anjaam dete hai
 One such part of the pre-central gyrus cortex is also known as the "motor cortex"
 cortex ke motor cortex kshetra ke vishisht neurons apane eksans ko basal gangliya ke striatum bhaag tak vistrut karte hai
 The neurons of the said cortics release the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is stimulating in nature
 glutamet se utsahit hone ke baad striatum main sthit koshikaayen do vibhinn dishaao main prakshepit hokar do pramukh path kaa nirmaan karti hai- "pratyaksh " evam "paroksh " paripath
 Once stimulated by the cortex in the direct circuit, the cells of the striatum produce a neuro-transmitter called anticonvulsant neurons) that the SNR-GPI projects onto complex cells
 esaenar or jipiai, lagaataar jieb nirmit karte hue ansa lenticulaaris paripath dwaara thilemus se sampark main rahete hue us par nirodhatmak prabhaav kriyanvit karne hetu prayatnsheel rahete hai
 Due to the inhibitory effect of SNR-GPI, the final conclusion is the omission of inhibitory effect on the thalamus
 yah dilachasp baat he ki thilemus khud cortex par prakshepit ho lagaataar cortex ko glutamet dwaara uttejit karata he
 Therefore, the direct circuit allows the thalamus to stimulate the cortex
 After being stimulated, the cortex transmits this "stimulation" message to the muscle via the lateral cortico spinal tract, resulting in hyper-kinetic behavior
 nimna aarekh "pratyaksh" maarg darshata he: Cortex - -> Striatum - -> "SNR-GPI" Complex - -> Thalamus - -> Cortex - -> Muscle, etc
 -> vipareet sire par apratyaksh paripath hota he jo ki striatum ke neurons se hi armbh hota he
 As soon as groups of neurons located in the striatum are stimulated by the cortex, the inhibitory axons now transmit anticonvulsant signals to cells of the globus pallidus externa
 jipii sabathalemic nabhik ko lagaataar nirodhi prabhaav darshaate hai
 stns are actually stimulated by the anticonvulsant effect
 iske falswaroop estn bhi tatpar hokar complex esaenar-jipiai ko uttejit karte hai, jahaan esaenar - jipiai complex kaa mukhya kaary thilemus par nirodhi prabhaav daalana hota he
 As a result, there is a decrease in the action of the thalamus by the thalamus to actually stimulate the cortex
 iske falswaroop cortex, parshv cortico spinal tract dwaara mansapeshiyon ko kam uttejit kar, ati gatij sthiti athwa gati main kami, main sahyog karata he
 In short, direct and indirect circuits are conflicting in performance
 cortex - -> striatum - -> jipii - -> estn - -> "esaenar-jipiai" complex - -> thilemus - -> cortex - -> mansapeshiyon, aadi -> However, if the direct circuit helps the motion and the indirect circuit does not help, then there is a paradox about the innate voluntary motion in the human body
 is virodhabhas kaa nidaan substenshia nigra pars compecta ke karyanvayan dwaara hota he jo dopamine kaa utpaadan karte hai
 Dopamine has specific D1 receptors located in the basal ganglia to stimulate the "direct" pathway, while dopamine has specific antagonistic effects on specific D2 receptors located in the basal ganglia and actually helps the "indirect pathway"

 adhikansh 2G GSM network 900 mhz yaa 1800 mhz band par kaary karte hai
 Some US countries use 850 mhz and 1900 mhz, as the 900 and 1800 mhz frequency bands were already allocated
 europe main zyaadaatar 3G GSM network 2100 mhz fricvency band main kaary karte hai
 Rare 400 and 450 mhz frequency bands are specified in some countries, where these frequencies were used for first generation systems

 The region derives its name from the two rivers named Indus and Ganga

 Some geographers divide the indo-gangetic Plain into several parts: the Indus Valley, the plains of Punjab, the plains of Haryana, and the middle and lowlands of the Ganges
 These regional differences are mainly based on the availability of water
 ek anya paribhaasha ke anusaar, sindhu-ganga ke maidan dilli rij dwaara do ghaatiyon main vibhajit hai; pashchimi bhaag main punjab or haryana ke maidani ilaake sthit hai or purvi bhaag ganga-brahmaputra kii jal nikasi pranaaliyon se bana he
 This division is only 300 meters above the sea surface, due to which there is a belief that the indus-gangetic plains seem to be continuous between the two valleys
 punjab evam haryana ke maidani ilaakon kii sinchai raavi, beas or sutluj nadiyon dwaara kii jaati he
 Due to the progress made in irrigation projects on these rivers, the flow of water has reduced, which reaches the lower valley areas of the Indian state of Punjab and the Indus Valley in Pakistan

 Many species of wild boar, deer and sambhar were found in the forest areas
 ganga ke kareeb daldali kshetron main dariyaan ghodon kii vilupt prajatiyon ke saath bhainson ke vishaal samooh charate hue nazar aate the
 Therefore, such a large number of animals must have attracted a large number of carnivorous animals as well
 Wolves, jackals, striped laggards, Indian cheetahs and Asiatic lions may have hunted heavily on the open plains while tigers and leopards may have hunted in the surrounding forests
 The Ganges was home to a large number of gharial, crocodiles and dolphins found in the river, which controlled the number of fishes and occasional herds crossing the river

 Various kingdoms rose and expanded in the flat and fertile region, including the Gupta Empire, Kannauj, Magadha, Mauryan Empire, Mughal Empire and Delhi Sultanate - the demographic and political centers of all these kingdoms were located in the indus-gangetic plains
 bhartiya itihaas ke vaidic or mahakavy yug ke dauraan, is kshetra ko "aryaavart" kaha jaataa tha jo pashchim main sindhu nadi tak tathaa dakshin main vindhya parvat shrinkhalaaon tak failaa hua tha
