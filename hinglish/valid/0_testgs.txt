 nasadeey sookt rugveda ke 10 wein mandal kar 129 waan sookt he
 This has to do with cosmology and the origin of the universe
 mana jaataa he kii yah sookt brahmand ke nirmaan ke bare main kaaphi sateek tathy bataata he
 This is why it has become very famous in the world
 nasadeey sookt main brahmand kii utpatti kaa darshanik varnan atyant utkrisht rup me kiya gaya he rishiyon ke adbhut is gyaan se siddh hota he ki samast sansar me sabhyataa kii paraakaashtha bharat me dekhi ja sakati thi or yah atishyokti nahi hogi 
 Rishi Prajapati is the author of Nasadi Sukta
 is sookt ke devtaa bhavavrutt he
 This sukta is mainly based on the fact that the universe must have been created
 sristi-utpatti sookt Anvaya-tadanim asatan aasit satto aasit; Rajah na aasit; Vyom noyat par: avarivah, kuh kasya sherman gahn gambhiram
 arth- us samay arthath sristi kii utpatti se pehle pralay dasha main asat arthath abhavatmak tatva nahin tha
 Satt = Bhava was not even an element, Raja = Swargalok was not a dead land and Hades, there was no space and what was beyond it was not, where was the covering element and under whose protection
 us samay gahan= kathinaayee se pravesh karne yogya gaharaa kya tha, arthath ve sab nahin the
 Unknown death: Nasitnam amritam, nightly: Ahn: preeminently nasit tat anit avatam, swadhaya ekhama katam karpan ki naar ki aan: 'arth – us pralay kaalik samay main mrityu nahin thi or amrit = mrityu kaa abhaav bhi nahin tha
 There was no knowledge of night and day, at that time, that Brahman element was present only in a form of life, void of action and connected with Maya, nothing was there with Brahman including that Maya and nothing beyond that
 
 anvay -agre tamasa gugham tamah aasit, apraketam edam sarvam salilim, aakhyatabhu tuchhen apihitam aasit tat ekam tapas mahina ajaayat
 Earth - before it was born, it was covered with dark darkness and it was present in the original cause, Jagat Tamas form, unknown, it was in the form of the whole world

 Anvay-agre tat kama: samvartat; yatmanas: adhipatramtham rea asit, satah bandhun kavya: manisahhridi satya asati nirvindanartha - At the time of creation, the first work = ie the will power to create creation, which was the first seed form in God's mind; Revolutionary sages discovered the reason for the bonding of the materially existing world in a unique absence from their knowledge

 Among the aforesaid mantras, in the Nasadasit Kamastadgre Mansaretta, avidya, kama-sankalpa and creation of seed-cause like sun-rays were very widespread in them

 Gods are also after the creation of this variety of creation, so even these gods cannot tell about the thing before them, so who knows man, because of which this whole world was born
 anvay- iyan visrushtih ytah abbhuv yadi vaa dadhe yadi vaa na
 Asya Yaya: President Verma as Anga Veda if neither Veda
 arth – yah vividh prakaar kii sristi jis prakaar ke upadan or nimitt kaaran se utpann huyi is kaa mukhya kaaran he ishwar ke dwaara ise dhaaran karnaa
 Apart from this, no one else can hold it

 Adhyasa is the technical term of Advaita Vedanta
 ek vastu main duusari vastu kaa gyaan adhyas kehalaata he
 The knowledge of the serpent by looking at the rope is an example of this
 yahan par rassi satya he, kintu usamen sarp kaa gyaan mithyaa he
 False knowledge is not possible without the basis of truth, so two aspects of the practice are considered - Truth and Unrighteous or False
 mithyaa kaa 'mithunikaran' adhyas kaa mul kaaran he
 In this mithunisation the religions of one are accused in the other
 rassi kii vakrata kaa sarp main aarope hota he, at: sarp kaa gyaan sambhav he
 Also, no one does this ritual intentionally; In fact, this accusation is done inadvertently, so there is no mutual conscience in truth and unconsciousness
 vivek hote hi adhyas kaa naash ho jaataa he
 The two things whose religions have mutual practice are in fact very different from each other
 unamem tathvik samya nahin hota; kintu aupchaarik dharmasamya ke aadhaar par yathakathanchit donon kaa mithunikaran hota he
 In the Shankar Bhashya, it is said that the symptom of adhyas is a reminder of a predetermined object in an object
 yah smritirup gyaan hi adhyas kehalaati he
 But the memory of a predetermined object is not false
 kisi ko dekhakar 'yah vahi vyakti he', aisa utpann gyaan satya he
 Hence the special meaning of the word 'smritarupa' is intended here
 smrit vastu ke rup kii tarah jiskaa rup ho, us vastu kaa usase bhinn sthaan par gyaan hona adhyas kaa sarvamaanya lakshan mana gaya he
 Seeing the rope reminds the snake and then the knowledge of snake
 yah sarpjnanasmriti sarpa se bhinn vastu he
 Vachaspati Mishra has said in the 'bhamati' - 'there is no knowledge of rope etc
 or serpentine with rhinoceros etc
 due to the nature of nature, but with this knowledge, rope etc
 becomes a snake or it produces snake properties
 It is also inconsistent
 yadi aisa hota to marupredash main kirnon ko dakhkar uchhalati tarangon kii maala se sushobhit mandakini aa gai he aisa gyaan hota or log uske jal se apni pipaasa shant karte
 Therefore, through practice, even if the object looks like the truth, it is foolish to assume the position of real truth in it
 yah adhyas yadi satyata se rahit ho to bandhyaputra aadi kii tarah iskaa gyaan nahin hona chahie
 But there is serpent knowledge, so it is not very untrue
 saath hi adhyas gyaan ko sat bhi nahin kar sakate, kyonki sarp kaa gyaan kathampi satya nahin he
 Satta and Asatta are conflicting, so Adhyas is not even a member
 antat: adhyas ko sadasat se vilakshan anirvachaneey kaha gaya he
 The superfluous water in this sequence is like real water, hence it is a foresight
 yah to mithyaabhoot anirvachaneey he
 There are two types of practice
 aadi shankaracharya ne veydantasutra ke bhashya kii jo bhoomika likhi, use adhyasabhashya kaha jaataa he
 It is not an annotation but an independent work as a preface to his main work
 adhyasabhashya kai tarah se vilakshan kriti he
 It is a miniature composition with less than 50 verses divided into five parts

 Gregor John Mendel was a German-speaking Austrian Augustinian pastor and scientist
 unhen anuvanshiki kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 He set the rules of genetics by experimenting on the seeds of peas
 unke kaaryon kii mahatta beesvin shatabdi tak nahin pahachaani gai baad main un niyamon kii punarkhoj ne unka mahatv bataaya
 The father of heredity, Gregor Johann Mandal, was born on July 22, 1822, in an ordinary farming family in the country of Moravia
 marvia ab chakoslavakia main he
 The child Johan used to help maintain the plants in the family's fields
 is kaary main inako vishesh anand miltaa tha
 As a child, these farmers used to ask their father different types of questions about where different colors and forms of flowers come from
 unke paas putr ke aise prashnon ke uttar nahin the
 He wanted to give the child higher education
 inkaa parivaar nirdhantaa ke abhishaap se ghira tha
 Even then, the father spent his four years in college, after spending a lot of money in Qatar
 jab ye ikkis varsh ke hue, to ek math main pravishtha hue
 He bore the name Gregor in honor of St
 Gregory
 inhone vyavsaay acha chunaa tha
 The mind was lost in the monastery
 inke saathi bhikshu premi evam budhimaan log the
 He took great interest in discussing all subjects from religion to literature and from art to science
 unka ek chota-sa haraa bharaa bagichaa tha, kyonki inako paudhon main vishesh anand aata tha isliye inako uskaa adhyaksh bana diya
 Along with this, he continued his religious studies and became a pastor in 1847 AD
 mendal kii vigyaan main ruchi ko dekhakar, math ne inako do varsh ke liye venice vishvavidhyalay main bhautikee padhane ke liye bhej diya
 When he returned from there after completing his studies, he used to take care of physics in the school of Altbrun Nagar, where he had a monastery
 in sab se bhikshu karttavyon main kisi prakaar kii koi baadha nahin padati thi
 Here too, Mendel began to raise questions which he used to raise on his father's farm
 kuch mataren chikani or kuch jhureendaar kyon hoti he? ham aisa kya karen, jisase ki keval chikani matar hi uge
 Sometimes they sow seeds of red flowers, so why do some new plants have pink flowers? ant main mendal kii utsukata kii vijay hui
 He decided to do some experiments which were really related to science
 unhone keval kalpana kaa sahaara nahin liya
 He used to observe and note down everything; Because peas were easy to grow
 isliye unhone matar se prayog kiye
 Pea had a short life and Mendel could study for generations
 mendal ne 1856 tak ke bich matar ke 10,000 paudhe boe or unka prekshan kiya
 An example of the kind of problem he tried to solve is: will the children of a tall pea and a small plant be tall or small? To obtain offspring from the tall plant and small plant, Mendel took the golden dust from the flower of the tall plant
 tathaa ise chote paudhe kii stri ke sir par daalaa
 The seeds that were made from it were sown
 sab paudhe 'pita' paudhe kii bhanti unche the
 Mendel called elevation an effective symptom
 jab in unchi santanon ke bachche hue, unke beej ugaae gaye, to unhone paaya ki duusari peedi athwa paudhon main sab paudhe unche nahin the
 One plant was small per three tall plants
 is chote paudhe ko daadi kii chhotai anuvanshikta main mili thi
 And smallness is called ineffective symptom
 isi prakaar pile bijon kii matar ko hare bijon ke saath sankarit kiya
 Then they came to the conclusion that the seeds of all plants were yellow from the first generation produced from them
 usamen agali peedi arthath paudhon main teen pile or ek haraa tha
 Yellow was the dominant and green ineffective symptom here
 inhen prayogon ko asankhya baar duharaaya par fal vahi niklaa
 After working with vigilance for eight years, when he was fully convinced, he said that the heredity of plants works according to some very unchanging rules
 swaabhaavik hi tha ki ve apane in nae siddhanton ke vishay main uttejit hon
 Now they decided that the time has come when they should tell the world what they have found out
 san 1865 i
 i wrote an article and read it in front of the scientific meeting of the city: but he realized that no one could understand his words
 shrotaaon ne namratapurvak taaliyaan bajaai or jo kuch vahaan suna use tatkaal hi bhul gaye
 Perhaps they could not explain them well
 ghar lautakar us lekh ko pun: likhaa
 a few weeks later he read it in another meeting, but even here no audience took any interest
 shaayad unhone samajha ho ki matar ke paudhon se bhi kya koi mahatvapurn baat siddh ho sakati he
 The speech was published in a small scientific journal
 vah sheeghra hi pustkaalay kii almariyon main apavitra or aprashansit tathaa dhuli se dhak gaya
 This discouraged them
 kuch din baad apane saathi bhikshuon se kaha, "meraa samay avashya ek din aayega
 " inke nidhan ke solah varsh uparant, vishwa ko pataa laga ki ve kitne bade vaigyanik the
 In 1900, three European scientists came to know of a forgotten article which was published 30 years ago
 unhone uski mahatta ko jaan liya or uskaa samachar vaigyanik duniyaan main failaa diya
 Soon it came to the conclusion that Mendel's law is true not only for plants, but also for animals and humans
 baad ke prayogon se pataa chalaa ki inke niyamon ke kuch apwaad bhi hai
 Now we do not call them rules, but principles
 inke siddhanth krishakon ke liye bahut sahaayak siddh hue hai
 He has told the farmers how good varieties of wheat, maize and other crops can be prepared
 inhi siddhanton par chalakar, pashu utpaadak adhik majboot, swasth gaayen or bhedon ko paidaa karne main safal hue hai

 parivaar saadharantaya pati, patni or bacchon ke samooh ko kehete hai, kintu duniya ke adhikansh bhaagon main vah sammilit vaasavale rakt sambandhiyon kaa samooh he jisamen vivaah or dattak pratha dwaara sweekrut vyakti bhi sammilit hai
 In all societies, children are born and brought up in the family
 bacchon kaa sanskaar karne or samaaj ke aachaar vyavhaar main unhen dikshit karne kaa kaam mukhya rup se parivaar main hota he
 Through this, the cultural heritage of the society is transferred from one generation to another
 vyakti kii saamaajik maryaada bahut kuch parivaar se hi nirdhaarit hoti he
 Male-female sexual relationships are mainly fixed within the family
 audyogic sabhyataa se utpann jansankul samaajon or nagaron ko yadi chhod diya jaae to vyakti kaa parichay mukhyat: uske parivaar or kul ke aadhaar par hota he
 Although there are many distinctions of the family in terms of composition, size, relationship and work in different regions and different periods of the world, these above mentioned tasks are universal and universal
 usamen desh, kaal, paristhiti or pratha aadi ke bhed sa ek yaa anek pidiyon kaa or ek yaa anek danpatiyon athwa pati-patniyon ke samoohon kaa hona sambhav he, uske sadsy ek paariwarik anushaasan vyavastha ke atirikt pati or patni, bhai or bahan, pitamah or pautra, chachaa or bhattije, saas or putravadhu jaise sambandhon tathaa kartavyon evam adhikaron se paraspar aabaddh, anya saamaajik samoohon ke sandarbh main ek ghanishtatam antarang samooh ke rup main rahete hai
 Within the family, the division of sex between men and women is also universal and time-bound
 striyon kaa adhikansh samay ghar main vyateet hota he
 Making food, taking care of children and cleaning the house and sewing clothes etc
 are such tasks which come in the female part
 purush bahari tathaa adhik shram ke kaary karata he, jaise kheti, vyapaar, udyog, pashuchaaran, shikaar or ladaai aadi
 Even then, this division is not same in all societies, it is difficult to make even a large general list because in many societies women also take part in activities like farming and hunting
 yo Family forms are closely related to forms of marriage
 levis margan aadi vikasvaadiyon kaa mat he ki maanav samaaj kii praarambhik avasthaa main vivaah pratha nahin thi or purna kamachar prachlit tha
 This was followed by a state of youth marriage, polyandry, polyandry and monogamy or monogamy in the social development
 vastut: bahuvivaah or ekapatnitv kii pratha asabhy or sabhy sabhi samaajon main pai jaati he
 Therefore, this view does not appear to be evidence
 maanav shishu ke paalan poshan ke liye lambii avadhi apekshit he or pehle bachein kii baalyavastha main hi anya chote bachche utpann hote rahete hai
 Mother's care in pregnancy and obstetric care is necessary
 phir, pashuon kii bhanti manushya main rati kii koi vishesh ritu nahin he
 Therefore, probably in the beginning of human society, either the entire community or a group of husband, wife and children was the family
 maanav vaigyanikon ko koi aisa samaaj nahin mila jahaan vivaah sambandh parivaar ke andar hi hote hon, at: pitristhaneey parivaar main patni ko or matrusthaneey parivaar main pati ko atirikt sadsyta pradaan kii jaati he
 In the couple's family, husband and wife together establish their separate household
 kintu adhikansh samaajon main yah parivaar brihattar kautumbik samooh kaa ang mana jaataa he or jivan ke anek prasangon main parivaar par brihattar kautubik samooh kaa, ghanisht sambadh ke atirikt, niyantran hota he
 In industrialized countries like the USA, there has been a multiplicity of couples in place of a family of couples

 Vellore Rebellion: The first instance of a large-scale and violent rebellion by the Indian sepoys against the East India Company in the state city of Vellore on 10 July 1806 predated the Indian Revolt of 1857 by half a century
 dakshin bhartiya shahar vellore main hue vidroh ne ek purna din chalaa, jiske dauraan vidrohiyon ne vellore kile ko jabt kar liya or 200 british sainikon ko maar daalaa yaa ghayal kar diya
 The rebellion was subdued from Arcot by cavalry and artillery
 prakope ke daman ke dauraan lagbhag 100 vidrohiyon kaa saransh nishpaadan hua, iske baad aupchaarik adaalat- choti sankhyaon ke marshall ke baad
 The immediate cause of the rebellion angered mainly Indian soldiers, pointing to a change in the Sepoy dress code introduced in November 1805
 hinduon ko unke maathe par dharmik ank pahanane se manaa kar diya gaya tha or muslimon ko apane dadhi dadhi or apane muunchon ko trim karne kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Also the commander-in-chief of the Madras army, General Sir John Craddock, ordered the wearing of a round hat which was associated with the time, both European and in general converted to Christianity
 inglistaani fouj kaa iraadaa tha ki saron par pahanane kii nai tapiyon main chamade ke kokade shaamil the or maujuuda pagadi ko badal den
 These measures angered both Hindu and Muslim soldiers' sensibilities and went contrary to earlier warnings by a military board that similar changes should be made to sepoy "every consideration that is necessary to the subject of that delicate and important nature"

 The motives of the civil conspirators remain unclear but by capturing and holding the fort they can probably hope to encourage a general rise through the territory of the erstwhile Mysore Sultanate
 haalanki, vidroh ke baad tipu ke bete charge karne ke liye anicchhuk the
 In July 1806 the garrison of Vellore Fort enlisted four companies of British infantry from the HM 69th Regiment of Foot and three battalions of the Madras infantry: 1st / 1st, 2nd / 1st and 2nd / 23rd Madras Native Infantry

 Unable to gain entry through the defended gate, Gillespie climbed the wall with the aid of a rope and a sergeant's sash that was lowered to him; And, to gain time, reached 69th place in a bayonet-charge with Rampart
 jab shesh 19 veen pahunche, to gilespie ne unhen apane galiyare bandook ke saath dwaar kholane ke liye uda diya, or pravesh dwaar ke andar ek jagah saafe karne ke liye dwaar ke saath doosraa charge banaaya taaki ghudsavaar ko tainaat kiya ja sake
 The 19th and the Madras Cavalry then charged and set any sepoy in their way
 mahal ke andar sharan paane vaale lagbhag 100 sipaahi laae gaye, or gilespie ke aadesh se, diwaar ke khilaaf rakhaa gaya or goli maar di gai
 Engineer John Blackiston, who had flown into the gates, recalled: "even with this terrible sight i could see, i can almost say, it's brief

 The harsh retaliation involving the sepoys broke the unrest at the stroke and provided the British history in India with one of its true epics; Because, Gillespie admitted that, with a delay of five minutes, all would have been lost to the British
 kul milakar, lagbhag 350 vidrohi maare gaye the, or ladaai samaapt hone se pehle ek or 350 ghayal ho gaye the

 There are some parallels between the Vellore Rebellion and the Indian Rebellion of 1857, although the latter was on a much larger scale
 1857 main sipaahi ne bahadur shah ko bharat ke samraat ke rup main pun: sthapit karke mughal shashan kii vaapasi kii ghoshnaa kii; vaise hi lagbhag 50 saal pehle vellore ke vidrohiyon ne tipu sultan ke putron ko satta behaal karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Perceived insensitivity to religious and cultural practices was a factor in both rebellions

 bisikil ke vibhinn bhaag nimnlikhit hai : The most important part of a bicycle is its frame
 frem kii banaavat aisi honi chahie ki usapar laganevaale purjein apana kaam kushaltapurvak kar saken
 The bicycle frame's triangular frame and front and back tongs are made of hollow, round tubes
 phir unhen frem ke konon par uchit prakaar ke braketon main phasaakar jhaal diya jaataa he
 Care is taken in making a triangular frame so that the middle lines of its lanes remain in the same plane
 frem main laga aage kaa stearing sira, usapar laganevaale handls kaa danthal or aage ke chimate ke danthal kii madhya rekhaayen ek duusari par sampati honi chahie
 The arms of the two tree tongs should also be symmetrical and parallel to their midline
 chakkon kii madhya rekha chimaton kii madhya rekha par sampati honi chahie, anyathaa bisikil santulit rahakar sidhi nahin chal sakegi
 It is the custom nowadays to put the wheels in the tactile direction of the navel
 sparsheey are, pahie ke ghere par bhraamak bal bhalee prakaar se daal sakate hai
 Each of the two adjacent areches are tangential in a tangent direction from the hub's flage
 peeche ke pahie main 40 or agle main 32 are lagate hai, at: usee ke anusaar uske gheron main chhed banaae jate hai or habon kii prayek flanz main ghere kii aadhi sankhya main chhed banaae jate hai
 While preparing the flywheel, Vyasabhimukh corrects the first eight arrows, then fills the remaining ones in the same sequence
 chitron main hub kii bai taraf kii flanz main hi are lagaakar dikhaae gaye hai, jo kram se ghere par visham sankhyankit chhedon main hi baithe he
 In even numbered holes, the flange of the right side will sit, so their places are shown empty
 taar se bane are sadaiv tanaav kii sthiti main rahane ke kaaran taan kehalaate hai
 While using the wheels, the wheels of the wheels should be examined from time to time, no shaft should be loose and under no stress
 ungali se bajaakar sabko dekha jaae to unamem ek si awaz nikalni chahie, anyathaa pahie tede hokar are tuutane lagenge
 Tightening them can be done by turning the nipples on the circle in the proper direction
 bisikil ke acchhee prakaar kaam kar sakane ke liye uske ball beringon kii taraf dhyaan dete rahanaa aavashyak he
 If there is a slight sound from any bearings, then there is definitely a defect in it
 use kholkar uske donon taraf kii goliyon kii ginati kar, kapade se ponchkar saaf chamakaa lijie
 If a bullet is broken, cracked or worn, replace it, then look at the circular grooves and corners of its bowl
 ve ghise, kate, yaa khurdare na hon
 If bad, replace them as well
 yadi uparyukt koi aib na ho tathaa goliyaan bhi ek hi sankhya main tathaa samaan naap kii hon, to usamen tel kii kami samajni chahie
 There should not be any kind of garbage or mud in any part of the bearings
 yah pichley pahie main lagaai jaati hai, jiske dwaara savaar apni ichha or aavashyaktaanusaar bisikil kii chaal ke anupaat ko badal sake
 Nowadays there is more promotion of three-speed gear hubs
 aisi giar naabhi bhi banaai jaati he ki peeche ko, arthath ulataa, pedal chalaane se brake lag jaataa he
 To change gait, the ratio of gait between the chakra chakra and navel is changed by dragging a chain with fine rings between the navel axis
 ise khinchne se naabhi ke bheetar lage guaron kii sthiti badal jaati he
 The rider does the work of pulling the chain with force by his liver, but the action of returning is done automatically by the segmental position in the navel
 naabhi ke purje kholane ke liye, pehle baayein haath kaa cone kholkar, phir daahine haath kii taraf lagi goliyon kii ring kholani chahie
 By putting it on the rear wheel, the rider can stop moving whenever he wants to, yet the wheel can continue to spin freely
 yah do prakaar kaa hota he, ek to gharshan belan yukt or doosraa ratchet daant yukt
 Each free wheel should have the quality that the inner parts are stuck on the chain of the pedal, and when the pedals are run again, the inner parts work together and do not slide
 saath hi chakra kii banaavat dhul or pani ke liye abhedya honi chahie
 Nowadays there is more prevalence of ratchet tooth free cycle
 iske ghere kii bhitari paridhi par ratchet ke daant kate hai, jinamein yathasthaan lagaae kute atakkar, pedal kii zanjeer ke madhyam se savaar dwaara die hue khinchaav ko pahie kii naabhi par pareshit kar dete hai
 The paddle stops chained as soon as it stops, and the dogs fall back and forth into the ratchet's teeth with the force of the segmental, causing the sound of "cuttings"
 yadi dubaara chalaane par mukt chakra phisalane lage, athwa jam ho jaae, to use thik karne kii pehali tarkeeb yah he ki usamen mitti kaa tel khub bharkar pahie ko khaali ghumaya jaae, jab vah sab tel nikal chuke tab usamen snehan tel de diya jaae
 If the Ab is not far, then the lid of the Chakra should be opened to see if the dogs have been eroded, or their commands have been broken
 phir use bheetar se bilkul saaf kar toote purje yaa goliyaan nai badalakar, dhakkan kii chudiyaan saavdhaanee se sidhi kas deni chahie
 To hold the tire on the wheel circle, it is made of either steel wire, or a hard knot of rubber on both sides of the wheel, which is clamped under the folded edge of the wheel and stuck to the inner rubber tube When the air is filled, the tire gets diluted and sits in place
 bhitari nalee main itani hi daab se hawa bharani chahie jisase tair savaar kaa bojha sah le or pahie kaa gheraa sadak ke kankad pattharon se nahin takaraae, anyathaa nalee ke kuchle jane or tair ke fat jane kaa dar rahegaa
 Overloading the tire reduces the flexibility of the tire to bounce on the bicycle road, but tightly inflating the required amount increases the diameter of the wheel to its limit and less power than the pedals when running on good roads Has to be imposed
 bhitari nalee main hawa bharne ke liye bud ke hawa valb kaa bahudhaa prayog hota he, jisaki banaavat chitra 13
 main spasht dikhaai gai he
 The rubber wall tube should not be torn, crushed and rotten
 balve ke plag ke upree sire par laganevaali topi sadaiv lagi rahani chahie
 The base of the balves should be tightened tightly on the nut circle
 balve kaa plag, rabar ke balve tub sahit bina rukaawat ke pravisht hokar, khaanchon main baith janaa chahie
 Paddle cracks are attached to their axles by cotters only
 bisikil ke girane, athwa durghatana ke kaaran, yadi crack yaa dhuree tedi ho jaaen, to krinkon ko juda karne ke liye, unpar lage cotter ke nat ko kholkar, kater ke chudeedaar sire ko hathode se thonk kar cotter ko nikaal lenaa chahie, lekin dhyaan rahe ki chudiyaan kharaab na ho jaaen
 Cotters should be applied only after applying any iron under the chest of the crank, otherwise the crank will hit the spindle or ball bearings
 kharabi ke kaaran yadi donon crank ek sidh main na hon, to cotter ke chapate bhaag ko retkar, yaa palatakar, samanjit kar dena chahie
 If the crank is loose on its axis, pushing the cotter to a greater depth is also useful
 bahut dinon tak deele cotter se hi bisikil chalaate rahane se cotter or crank kaa chhed, donon hi, cat jate hai tathaa dhuree kaa khaanchaa bhi bighad jaataa he
 So it is better to change the new couture
 bisikil ke girane se akasar pedal pin bhi tedi ho jaati he
 In such a condition, take off the cap of the waring on the outside of the pedal and take out the cone cone and take the tablets in your hand
 phir pedal kii frem ko sarkaakar, bhitaravale vering kii goliyaan bhi samhaalkar le leni chahie, aisa karne par pedal nikal aayega or padalpin hi crank main lagi rah jaaegi
 After inspecting it and straightening it into the moon, the pedal should be tied up as necessary
 yah zanjeer choti choti pattinuma kadiyon, belanon or rivaton dwaara banaai jaati he
 It should be cleaned, greased with oil and mixed with its stretch and kept in good condition
 zanjeer ke rivatiy jodon ke deele hone tathaa belanon ke ghis jane se uski samgr lambaai bad jaaya karti he
 The pitch of the teeth of the pedal tread wheel does not change, so it hurts by descending from the chain wheel
 isaki pahichaan yah he ki patr par chadhi hui zanjeer ke sparshachaap ke bich main, use anguthe or tarjani se pakadakar baahar kii taraf khinchaa jaae
 If the chain is stretched only about an inch, then it is fine and if it is stretched by an inch, it must have slipped and loosened
 at: badal deni chahie
 The function of manual brakes that pressurize the wheels is based on the connection of the levers and poles
 bauden ke brake, ispaat kii lacheelee nalee main lage ek atampidya taar ke khinchaav par aadhaarit hote hai
 The segregation works to free the brakes
 brake, suraksha kaa pradhan upkaran he, at: brake ke danda susamanjit rahane chahie, arthath aise rahane chahie ki ve aron yaa tiron main na ataken
 The poles should be strong and easy to rotate on the joints
 dekhne main achche or purjein saaf suthere bhi rahane chahie
